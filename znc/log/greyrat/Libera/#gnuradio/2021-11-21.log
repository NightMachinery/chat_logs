[00:21:05] <BarryDuggan[m]> willcode4: are pygccxml and pyqtgraph needed for 3.8?
[00:23:12] <willcode4[m]> Not pygccxml - that is related to autogen for pybind. Don't think pyqtgraph is used in 3.8.

[00:37:46] <willcode4[m]> Custom Buffers. Josh Morman has a list I think.

[01:06:06] <linext__> do the cables running to an antenna act as part of the antenna?
[01:06:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> linext__: sometimes, yes
[01:07:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> If the transmission line isn't well-matched to the antenna in terms of both impedance and "balance", then in effect teh transmission line becomes radiative.
[01:07:49] <linext__> i'm hooking up two hdhomerun quad atsc tuners to one antenna
[01:08:04] <funkylab[m]> with which kind of splitter?
[01:08:06] <linext__> i put a cable tv amplifer in between and it seems to be helping
[01:08:14] <linext__> the amplifer is the splitter
[01:08:49] <linext__> it has a gain knob, which works well in the mid-range
[01:08:51] <funkylab[m]> yes, that'd work as splitters, though I'd assume that a cable TV amp isn't what other people would call an LNA
[01:08:58] <funkylab[m]> oh
[01:09:16] <linext__> it said on the package that it can be used for a tv antenna
[01:09:19] <funkylab[m]> if it works well in the mid-range, cable TV is weaker than what I would have assumed
[01:09:23] <funkylab[m]> nice
[01:09:53] <linext__> i'm getting about 54 channels on the two tuners, which is the same as when one tuner is connected directly to the antenna
[01:10:11] <funkylab[m]> but nevertheless, patchvonbraun is right: your coax needs to be matched to the antenna and to the amp, otherwise it will become part of the antenna :)
[01:10:40] <funkylab[m]> as much as an unintended radiator as as an unintended interference sensor ;)
[01:10:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> Is it a distribution amplifier with multiple outputs?
[01:11:04] <linext__> yes, 1 input and 4 output
[01:11:08] <linext__> made by radioshack
[01:11:46] <linext__> i'd like to put the antenna on the roof but my parents own the house and said no
[01:12:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> Ah ok. And your antenna is 75 ohm?
[01:12:06] <linext__> so it's a big outdoor omni antenna hanging on the wall
[01:12:35] <linext__> about 3 foot by 3 foot
[01:12:55] <funkylab[m]> that doesn't tell us its impedance

[08:38:18] <drmpeg> Hey, I did setup my HDHomeRun. Works good.
[08:40:36] <drmpeg> The ATSC 3.0 hot spot is Phoenix.
[08:40:45] <muaddib[m]> Sounds really cool. Iâ€™d like to learn more about it and TV broadcast stations in general. Way back when I worked in Live TV production, we would do freq coord in each city and slot our mics in analog TV station bands cause the audio and chroma had a gap between them. Then the digital changeover happened. But thatâ€™s kinda it.
[08:40:57] <drmpeg> 4 stations.
[08:44:40] <drmpeg> When I was working in video compression, we didn't even bother with the broadcast market. Too small. Cable systems was where it was at.
[08:45:21] <drmpeg> We did a cable set top box project and sold a million chips.

[09:14:16] <drmpeg> And the boxes are much smaller.
[09:17:00] <drmpeg> I've been retired since 2011, so I'm pretty much out of the loop now.
[09:17:59] <drmpeg> Most of the folks I used to work with have moved on to machine vision.
[09:18:19] <drmpeg> That's the hot new market.
[09:22:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> I worked with MPEG stuff peripherally when I worked for IrDeto.  We took MPEG streams and farked them up in just the right way :)
[09:26:15] <drmpeg> Didn't you do Blu-Ray too?
[09:27:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, I worked in the BD-PLUS team when I got laid off.   BD-PLUS took the MPEG stream, and screwed up bits of strategic frames, and stored the corrections in an obfuscador 
[09:29:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> We were also working on collusion-resitant watermarking for BD-PLUS when it all came crashing down around us.  Disney bought Fox (our only customer for BD-PLUS), and Disney chose to shut down that part of Fox Studios, so we got hosed.  In the end, I was glad to be rid of what I consider a sordid portion of my professional career.
[09:33:07] <drmpeg> Yeah, LSI Logic got hosed too. They put most of the marbles into DVD recordable. And then that market disappeared.
[09:34:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> Well, at least DVD recordable wasn't sordid in the way BD-PLUS was sordid....
[09:34:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> DVD recordable just kinda went the way of buggy-whips.
[09:35:13] <drmpeg> Nobody wants to archive.
[09:35:30] <drmpeg> DVR's killed it.
[09:37:04] <patchvonbraun[m]> My work was what I described as "teensy nuggets of gold thinly distributed in a matrix of fresh horse doo-doo"
[09:37:33] <drmpeg> Ha!
[09:37:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> There were lots and lots of fiendishly clever ideas that once you realized the bigger context of what they were being used for, it kinda made you throw up in your mouth a little.
[09:38:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> I implemented Tardos coding for traitor-tracing watermarking.  Really fascinating stuff.  But, with DRM/Anti-piracy as the ethical back-drop, it was all kind of gross.
[09:40:46] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: something ive been needing to dig into more, is figuring out how the hw encoder/decoder works on the rpi
[09:41:26] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: from what ive seen, there is one shared hw block, that can handle vc1, mpeg2, and h264, both encode and decode
[09:41:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> We worked on special Android Linux kernels that "committed unspeakable horrors" all in the name of DRM.  Fortunately, no customer was interested enough to continue funding that work, so I got redeployed.  First to a still-born industry thing called Vidity, and then in to the BD-PLUS group.

[09:45:08] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: as an example, the h264 encoder on the rpi accepts the input frame twice, once at full resolution, and again at half resolution in each axis, apparently for motion estimation, does that sound like something all 3 codecs could deal with?
[09:45:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: Various things.  All involved with making it harder to debug/inspect running code.  I was listed on a patent for something i called "oblivious patching".  You'd keep critical bits of code/data for an application in an "obfuscador", and at just the right moment, they'd get mapped into the processes address space, etc.  Blah.  Not something I'm particularly proud of.
[09:45:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> clever: You should perhaps ask drmpeg, not me.
[09:46:46] <drmpeg> I don't know much about it. I'll guess it's some sort of DSP core.
[09:46:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> We had one thing that I was really really against, but we did it anyway, which was to walk the call-stack backwards one certain system calls to decide whether the callling environment was "DRM-safe" before executing the system call.  
[09:47:31] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: ah, WoW did something similar in its scripting system
[09:47:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> Some of our kernel code was itself run through the obfuscator prior to compilation/linking.  We actually found some interesting GCC bugs that way :)

[09:49:18] <clever> raspi-foundation decided to save costs, by making those features optional, and the end-user could pay the fee and buy a license key
[09:49:32] <drmpeg> H.265 is even worse.

[09:50:44] <clever> since then, the patents have expired in most countries
[09:50:56] <clever> and you only need to pay the fee if selling units in malaysia
[09:51:10] <clever> but RPF cant proove the rpi isnt entering malaysia, so you must still buy the license key!
[09:51:32] <drmpeg> I used to work with guy that had an MPEG patent. It was like side salary.
[09:51:55] <clever> from what i know of the hardware, the bcm2711 (pi4/pi400/cm4) is still capable of mpeg2/vc1
[09:52:11] <clever> because it has the same hw h264 component
[09:52:31] <clever> but RPF has decided to run away from that mess, and just claimed the bcm2711 has no mpeg2/vc1 support
[09:52:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> IrDeto are still selling their code transformer (they called it a transcoder, just to confuse MPEG people) as if it's actual security instead of just security-through-obscurity dipped in LSD.
[09:52:49] <drmpeg> Yeah, if it can do H.264, it can do MPEG-2 and VC1.
[09:52:55] <clever> they removed hw mpeg2/vc1 support from the firmware
[09:53:26] <drmpeg> Apple never did MPEG-2.
[09:53:39] <clever> their reasoning, is that the arm core is now plenty fast for mpeg2 decode, do it in software
[09:53:50] <clever> but if your in a battery based decide, that will waste battery life
[09:54:11] <clever> and RPF is forcing you to take the worse option, just to avoid having to be a middle-man with fee's
[09:54:53] <clever> drmpeg: what would the mpeg patent lawyers do, if somebody was to RE that hardware, and implement a fee-free version?
[09:56:09] <clever> and there is the other issue, if i dont understand the codecs well, i cant really figure out the hw, and the most i can do is just turn the blob back into source, and that feels worse on the copyright front
[10:01:57] <drmpeg> On the C-Cube/LSI Logic chips, there was a SPARC core and then a lot of bespoke DSP units.
[10:02:32] <drmpeg> For encode, the most important unit was the motion estimator.
[10:02:38] <clever> drmpeg: the hw accel on the rpi does have its own dedicated cpu core with an unknown ISA, and the license key check is implemented in that ISA
[10:04:08] <clever> > H264 encode actually uses a number of sub-blocks: Motion Estimation, Prediction, Quantisation, and entropy coding (CABAC or CAVLC).
[10:04:11] <clever> > The VCE is a small processor to assist the video codec hardware blocks.
[10:04:12] <clever> drmpeg: one of the rpi engineers said the above on the forums
[10:06:50] <drmpeg> For the DSP/ME units, there's usually some sort of register based control and some sort of memory that it works on.
[10:07:22] <clever> > The H264 blocks need the frames in a weird column format(*), and also a second 2x2 subsampled version of the image to do a coarse motion search on. The ISP can produce both these images efficiently, and there isn't an easy way to configure the outside world to produce and pass in this pair of images simultaneously.
[10:07:27] <clever> > (*) If you divide your image into 128 column wide strips with both the luma and respective U/V (NV12) interleaved chroma, and then glue these strips together end on end, that's about right. The subsampled image is either planar or a similar column format but 32 pixels wide. Cleverer people than me designed it for optimised SDRAM access patterns.
[10:08:08] <clever> drmpeg: the images in ram also have to be formated into a fairly wonky planar format, i suspect so that when you fetch a macroblock, each line of the image becomes a sequential fetch, so the bus can saturate better
[10:08:55] <drmpeg> Oh yeah. Memory bandwidth is crucial.
[10:09:12] <clever> the gpu end only has a 128kb L2 cache
[10:09:35] <clever> thats not enough to buffer a frame, so all camera and h264 based tasks must have cache-misses
[10:09:55] <clever> and if done right, it will only be accessed once by each, so the cache serves zero benefit
[10:12:20] <clever> let me see if sparc is the answer...
[10:13:26] <drmpeg> Oh SPARC was just a by product of the designer at C-Cube. Les Kohn, the designer of UltraSPARC.
[10:13:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> I developed an obfuscated RISC CPU design while I was at IrDeto.  The CPU had N different variants of the ISA, and the external address bus was permuted.
[10:14:09] <clever> drmpeg: yeah, if i disassemble a VCE program as sparc, i just get nonsense, so thats not it
[10:14:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> Never got used anywhere that I know of.  But it was a useful distraction one week...
[10:14:44] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: oh, that reminds me, the ddr4 controller on the bcm2711 has its own firmware blob, and some byte-swap mess going on
[10:15:16] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: basically, there is a 32bit register for a FIFO, to load firmware into the ddr4 controller, and the main firmware loads it 32bits at a time, and it little-endian
[10:15:25] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: but i think the FIFO->ram stage is big endian
[10:16:08] <clever> so a string literal of "abcdefgh" appears as "dcbahgfe" in the raw binary, lol
[10:16:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, I was going to say, that's probably to deal with big/litle endian stuff, rather than a deliberate attempt to obfuscate for DRM purposes.

[18:58:27] <drmpeg> @ClaytonargiloVE3 The dev version of the HDHomeRun gives you much better signal stats. https://www.w6rz.net/hdhomerun.png
[18:58:54] <drmpeg> The dB figure is real S/N.
[19:00:24] <drmpeg> I went on #hdhomerun to find out where to get the dev software and had a nice chat with the devs.
[19:00:47] <ClaytonargiloVE3> Nice!
[19:01:20] <drmpeg> It turns out that they use GNU Radio and the DVB-T2 transmitter to test their European products.
[19:02:09] *** Quits: arch3r (~ben@185.66.194.79) (Quit: bye)
[19:02:25] *** Joins: arch3r (~ben@185.66.194.79)
[19:04:39] <drmpeg> And it works on 429 MHz if you change to us-cable mode.
[19:09:40] <ClaytonargiloVE3> I guess ATSC 3.0 would be good for amateur use since it can go down to very low SNR.
[19:10:17] <drmpeg> I was running 5/15 last night at 12 dB S/N
[19:10:35] <drmpeg> And still HD.
[19:11:07] <drmpeg> Also, the HDHomeRun works on 902 to 928 MHz.
[19:11:37] <drmpeg> The center freqs are 909, 915 and 921 MHz.
[19:11:58] <ClaytonargiloVE3> Are those cable channels?
[19:12:14] <drmpeg> On newer systems.
[19:12:44] <drmpeg> Channels 143, 144 and 145.
[19:17:59] <ClaytonargiloVE3> Too bad they don't line up with the channels in the bandplan.
[19:22:19] <drmpeg> Which band plan? This one? http://www.arrl.org/band-plan
[19:25:41] <drmpeg> I think 915 and 921 MHz would be ok according to that band plan.
[19:25:46] <ClaytonargiloVE3> I was looking at the Canadian one, which has 910-916 and 922-928 for TV.
[19:25:56] <drmpeg> Ahh.
[19:28:14] <ClaytonargiloVE3> Not that the band plan matters that much on a band that is rarely used.

[19:30:20] <drmpeg> I would be reluctant to transmit wideband on 33cm. Every gas and electricity meter in my neighborhood might stop working.
[19:30:59] <ClaytonargiloVE3> They'd probably be fine because they use FHSS.
[19:32:16] <drmpeg> Time to build that kilowatt amp for 33cm. :)
[19:32:30] <drmpeg> To test the theory.

[19:45:43] <drmpeg> Should be pretty good. You could use really short frames. Just a few symbols.
[19:46:16] <drmpeg> Of course, GNU Radio would get in the way.
[19:47:17] <drmpeg> When I did my IP over DVB-T2 project, I was able to get around 200 ms ping times.
[19:47:32] <Yamakaja[m]> Lolwat :D
[19:47:38] <drmpeg> And that's round trip.
[19:48:02] <drmpeg> GNU Radio is pretty hideous for latency.
[19:48:08] <Yamakaja[m]> I've seen a lot of weird IP over X or Y over IPs, but IP over DVB-T2 is a new one xD
[19:48:33] <drmpeg> Oh, there's a spec.
[19:48:51] <drmpeg> And a Linux driver.
[19:48:52] <Yamakaja[m]> Huh? Isn'T DVB-T2 usually unidirectional?
[19:49:05] <drmpeg> Full duplex baby.
[19:49:17] <Yamakaja[m]> wth. It's "Digital Video Broadcast", right?
[19:49:49] <drmpeg> https://www.w6rz.net/ofdm3.png
[19:50:22] <drmpeg> 30 Mbps.
[19:50:38] <Yamakaja[m]> 0.o
[19:51:12] <drmpeg> I did go a little Cadillac on the test bed.
[19:51:51] <Yamakaja[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_DVB -> So usually there's some out of band return channel
[19:52:29] <drmpeg> Yeah, for the broadcast application.
[19:54:43] <funkylab[m]> DVB-S2X is mostly about packet transport, isn't it?
[19:55:24] <drmpeg> No, it's still for video.
[19:56:45] <drmpeg> The low S/N modes are for small satellite terminals though. So yeah, packet based.
[20:01:14] <funkylab[m]> ah

[20:04:10] <drmpeg> I used ULE for the IP over DVB-T2 project. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4326
[20:04:41] <drmpeg> There's a little known Linux driver for it.
[20:06:08] <drmpeg> It creates an Ethernet interface.
[20:06:48] <drmpeg> And then I hacked a pcap capture to work in the TX direction.
[20:07:30] <drmpeg> https://github.com/drmpeg/gr-ule
[20:08:11] <drmpeg> I gotta update that to 3.8 and 3.9.
[20:09:54] <drmpeg> Here's the Linux driver. https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c
[20:13:45] <drmpeg> It worked fantastically well, even with the 200ms latency. Although not shown on the diagram, It also works with IPv6

[22:40:42] <muaddib[m]> is a rebuild of gnuradio required if UHD gets upgraded?
[22:40:46] <funkylab[m]> in general, yes
[22:40:58] <funkylab[m]> as with any other linked library
[22:41:27] <funkylab[m]> (the only exception would be if the UHD update was ABI compatible, i.e. if only the last of the four version counters increased.)
[22:43:53] <muaddib[m]> thanks funkylab
