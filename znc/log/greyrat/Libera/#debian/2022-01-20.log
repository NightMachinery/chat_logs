[00:14:05] <rawtaz> effectively the same then.
[00:14:23] <jelly> expect the parts that are not the same.
[00:14:24] <rawtaz> the problem is that this wont find all the stuff if they have various different devices mounted
[00:14:34] <rawtaz> (which however boils down to how "entire system" is define :D)
[00:15:01] <karlpinc> rawtaz: It'll never finish if you try looking through /proc.  (At least the last time I tried it.)

[00:15:25] <rawtaz> jelly: what about plain and simple hard drives (e.g. external) mounted at some path, which now wont be searched?
[00:15:31] <rawtaz> karlpinc: yeah thats what i wrote
[00:15:52] <XileX> Many folders don't have read permission, so there are many 'permission denied' lines too
[00:15:56] <rawtaz> then i added -x which was wrong because im mostly on mac, it should be xdev, and yes i would use single quotes to quote the pattern but meh
[00:16:19] <jelly> you started right but those bits are not meh
[00:16:44] <rawtaz> jelly: please answer my question above? :)
[00:16:56] <rawtaz> i hear what you are saying about the syntax and commands

[00:53:46] <karlpinc> gumbo: The man pages, especially "man less", to learn how to read man pages.  The info pages.

[01:09:52] *** Joins: ouestbillie (~gallup@45.83.220.194)
[01:10:13] <Shadur> I've got a question about fwupd in sid. I use fwupd-amd64-signed because I'm fairly sure I've got UEFI secure mode on since I'm dualbooting win10. However, the current fwupd upgrade conflicts with fwupd-amd64-signed. Will upgrading render my system unbootable, or was something changed in the way the software is setup?
[01:10:19] <somiaj> For instance, outside of during dist-upgrades, the tracker and BTS aren't always the most useful for stable users, though really useful for #debian-next
[01:10:19] <knghtbrd> and pinfo pinfo if you think the GNU info program is kind of obnoxious.
[01:11:28] <knghtbrd> pinfo is ‚Ä¶ differently obnoxious, but behaves generally like lynx, so it's at least somewhat familiar to most people
[01:11:30] *** Joins: beaver (~beaver@user/pong)
[01:13:25] <karlpinc> knghtbrd: FWIW, info is like emacs.  So emacs people will like it.  (Like the default bash bindings.)

[01:14:58] <gumbo> karlpinc: info info command not found
[01:15:17] <knghtbrd> gumbo: info is a package that isn't likely installed by default anymore
[01:15:33] <karlpinc> Shadur: I don't know.  It's the sort of thing that might be in the bullseye relase notes, but I don't recall anything.  sources.debian.org might be a good place to look for the README.Debian in a version you've not got installed.  ??
[01:15:39] <greycat> It's got "Priority: important"
[01:15:44] <knghtbrd> You CAN read a texinfo file with any text viewer
[01:15:59] <greycat> So either this isn't Debian, or they did an install without Standard packages.
[01:16:22] <karlpinc> Or they typed something funny.
[01:16:34] <knghtbrd> greycat: info wasn't installed for me by default

[01:18:15] <knghtbrd> Either way, gumbo, you should probably install it. I did and I don't use it‚Äîit's one of those standard things anyone sitting down at a command line will expect to exist.
[01:18:56] <karlpinc> gumbo: info info  (without any quotes or anything, is supposed to work.  Otherwise, how did you install?)
[01:18:56] <Shadur> This is my desktop system so I'm understandably leery of doing something that might actually brick it.
[01:20:14] <knghtbrd> Shadur: you can just hold off until -signed is uploaded (usual recommendation) or you can go turn off secureboot in your EFI config
[01:20:51] <knghtbrd> The problem is that some EFIs will not LET you turn off SecureBoot (which isn't actually, but that's another rant.)
[01:22:08] * Shadur nods. I've been doing that but it's been a while and I can't seem to find any explanation or discussion, plus there seems to have been a name change at some point and there's an explicit Conflicts: line in fwupd that concerns me a bit.
[01:22:49] <amacater_> Shadur - sid lives in #debian-next, I think :)

[13:35:06] <jelly> !free ram
[13:35:06] <dpkg> Unlike information, your computer's memory does *not* want to be free.  Free RAM is wasted RAM!  Linux tries to use free physical memory for caching files from disk which speeds up disk access considerably.  Linux releases RAM from these caches if programs need it.  To know how much physical memory the free(1) tool says you have left for program use, it's 'available', or roughly 'free' + 'buffers' + 'cache'.  Also ask me about <swapwake>.
[13:36:44] <Khepra> what, no link to linuxatemyram in the fac toid?

[13:38:30] <PerfDave> I do wonder how much extra power consumption is caused by using RAM as a cache, and how much it's needed now we're getting SSDs which are nearly as fast to access as RAM...

[13:40:29] <PerfDave> But the faster they get, the less  benefit there is from the cacheing.

[22:13:58] *** Joins: gumbo (~quassel@user/gumbo)
[22:14:13] <jelly> Khepra, I'm not going to check all the vulns you're interested in instead of you.
[22:14:27] <johnfg> I'm not going to *fix* the problem for openafs-client, as it's changed for bullseye anyway, to kafs-client.
[22:15:02] <johnfg> So, with my bullseye sources.list in place, to do my upgrade, just run: 'apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade' ?
[22:15:02] <jelly> Khepra, go verify each of them, and poke the kernel team if you notice they missed something
[22:15:31] <jelly> don't: go "debian LIES about security support"
[22:17:08] <jelly> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[22:17:08] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[22:20:14] <johnfg> Anyway, rather than try to get that fixed first, before upgrading to bullseye, I think I'll do the upgrade and get openafs working from bullseye.
[22:20:21] <Khepra> jelly: I have. And they didn't miss it, the trcker is listing the CVEs and the kernel is vulnerable. They're simply not producig updates, for whatever reason. Yes, the "debian takes security serious" is a lie.
