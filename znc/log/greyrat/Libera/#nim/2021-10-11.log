[02:33:22] <FromDiscord> <zidsal> quick question how come `proc add[T](x: var seq[T]; value: sink T) ` is annotated with noSideEffect? surely the fact it mutates the sequence is a side effect!
[02:33:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Nope
[02:33:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> the sequence is passed as a mutable parameter
[02:34:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Modification of mutable parameters is not a side effect as it was explicitly mutable
[02:34:23] <FromDiscord> <zidsal> I guess that's a way of seeing it! fair enough
[02:37:10] <Mister_Magister> @Yardanico gotcha thanks
[02:39:24] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> it's an effect rather than a side-effect I guess?
[02:39:30] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> though yeah I would still be surprised
[02:40:09] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well side effect is about mutating anything that is not passed in, or chance to mutate it
[02:40:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's why you cannot even echo global `let/var`s
[02:43:40] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> I think it's a sensible definition of "no side effects" for procedural code
[02:44:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well strict funcs does it better since you cannot mutate any parameter that's not `var` including references
[02:44:32] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> yeah
[02:44:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Makes it vastly more consistent

[10:17:59] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yes you put that after the await

[10:19:08] <PMunch> Sleep?
[10:19:34] <FromDiscord> <retkid> i was testing async by spamming server connectons on a sleep
[10:19:52] <FromDiscord> <retkid> but, the sleep isn't on the server so the transaction happens really quickly

[10:22:51] <FromDiscord> <retkid> because the sleep isn't on the server side
[10:23:19] <PMunch> No, it's because you're sending 1 request a second, which even the most horrible servers should be perfectly able to cope with

[10:37:27] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Even if that’s not the async code it makes no sense
[10:37:30] <FromDiscord> <retkid> i kinda thought async was a form of threading
[10:37:34] <FromDiscord> <retkid> which makes no sense
[10:37:48] <FromDiscord> <retkid> so i thought something in parallel was happening

[21:06:04] <Mister_Magister> @Prestige i used this example https://github.com/nim-lang/sdl2/blob/master/examples/sdl_skeleton.nim and did echo evt to see events and there is nothing when i interact with controller and window is focused
[21:07:28] <nrds> <06Prestige99> iirc you have to set some window flag to enable joystick support
[21:07:35] <nrds> <06Prestige99> let me look into it for a min

[21:08:44] <nrds> <06Prestige99> https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15/docs/html/joystick.html this should have the info you need
[21:09:09] <Mister_Magister> Joystick support is initialized by passed the SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK, and the example already does INIT_EVERYTHING
[21:09:16] <nrds> <06Prestige99> since you're using INIT_EVERYTHING you should be good, probably just need to open the joystick now

[21:15:58] <Mister_Magister> yep discard joystickOpen(0) did the trick

[22:47:55] <PMunch> Good old rubber-ducking Mister_Magister :)
[22:56:33] <Mister_Magister> PMunch: i know right? :P
[22:56:59] <Mister_Magister> @Prestige im using gamepad to control rc car that has raspberry on it
[22:57:11] <Mister_Magister> litreally made my own wrapper for gpio library just to be able to use nim on raspi

[23:02:08] <PMunch> Wasn't there one already?
[23:02:59] <Mister_Magister> PMunch: nope
[23:03:06] <PMunch> Huh
[23:04:20] <Mister_Magister> PMunch: there is outdated wrapper for deprecated pile of hot steaming shit called wiringPi but for obvious reasons i didn't use it
[23:06:09] <Mister_Magister> i gotta figure out voltage divider
[23:09:12] <PMunch> Ah right :P
[23:09:25] <PMunch> Those are pretty simple though aren't they?

[23:09:41] <Mister_Magister> mhm
[23:10:39] <Mister_Magister> currently soldering pins to adc
[23:10:47] <Mister_Magister> im getting better at soldering
[23:14:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ~~ngl raspi just for rc car controller is overkill as fuckkkkk~~
[23:14:54] <Mister_Magister> @Rika for now
[23:15:01] <Mister_Magister> it will be fpv rc car
[23:15:08] <FromDiscord> <Rika> oh damn
[23:15:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> now thats cool
[23:15:23] <Mister_Magister> raspi, as it can have 1080p camera, seemed nice choice
[23:15:42] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i mean there are still other options but the raspi sounds easiest
[23:16:23] <Mister_Magister> i wanted to have fun programming everything myself
[23:16:27] <Mister_Magister> and also cost
[23:16:33] <Mister_Magister> its lowest cost possible
[23:20:17] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i mean easy to find
[23:20:18] <FromDiscord> <Rika> but yeah
[23:20:27] <FromDiscord> <Rika> finding mcus are a fucking pain right now (ehem)

[23:40:59] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Hope you're all getting your t-shirts: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8478. Great way to help our community libraries improve 🙂
[23:42:39] <Mister_Magister> @dom96 can u explain in 2 sentences?
[23:43:13] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Make 4 PRs and DigitalOcean/GitHub will give you a t-shirt
[23:43:36] <FromDiscord> <dom96> (oh, and get them merged + they have to be in repos that have the `hacktoberfest` tag)
[23:43:52] <FromDiscord> <dom96> (you can read https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ for specifics)
[23:44:25] <nrds> <06Prestige99> @dom96 did you happen to see my earlier message about nimble?
[23:45:15] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Prestige: yes, please submit an issue in the repo
[23:45:19] <Mister_Magister> @dom96 meh, thought i could do something with my new lib i made for nim
[23:45:31] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Sure thing, I can get to it after work
[23:46:43] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Mister_Magister: technically I think you can, just create PRs on your own repo 😄
