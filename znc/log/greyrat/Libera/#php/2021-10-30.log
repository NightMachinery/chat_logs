[04:20:10] <lembron> is there a htmlspecialchars like that converts to "valid <key>´s"? so turns say "hello you" into "hello_you"
[04:20:37] <coder7of9> str_replace
[04:20:52] <Albright> strtr() if all find and replace characters are 1 byte
[04:21:11] <Albright> (one "character" and no Unicode)
[04:21:29] <lembron> whole point is to not have to manually hosuekeep that list.. ' ', '&', '+'...
[04:21:46] <Albright> Well, you'd use both
[04:22:13] <Albright> htmlspecialchars() to convert the chars it converts, strtr()/str_replace() to cover the "custom" ones.
[04:22:32] <Albright> (Maybe in the other order depending on what you need)
[04:22:53] <lembron> &amp; is just as wrong as & when trying to use as <ke&na> :P
[04:23:02] <coder7of9> with str_replace you can have an array in and array out
[04:23:21] <Albright> Oh, can you?
[04:23:26] <coder7of9> yes
[04:23:56] <Albright> Nice. I *think* I knew this at one time but since forgot. :P
[04:24:24] <coder7of9> str_replace(  ['*','-'], ['&apm;','_'], words  )
[04:24:42] <coder7of9> obviously cleaner but you can get the idea
[04:24:52] <lembron> <lembron> whole point is to not have to manually hosuekeep that list.. ' ', '&', '+'...
[04:25:18] <coder7of9> at some point you will have to.... even php has a list to refer to with htmlspecialchars
[04:25:36] <coder7of9> but with an array you can optimize
[04:26:13] <coder7of9> you can abstract it
[04:26:14] <Albright> You wouldn't have to housekeep the *whole* list
[04:26:27] <lembron> this is not a question how to replace chars, well aware of that - but if someone somewhere HAS that list already, prefeeredly as part of php/simplexml/similar ;-)
[04:26:53] <Albright> Maybe we don't understand what you're asking.
[04:26:58] <coder7of9> that list is a vague term
[04:27:07] <coder7of9> you would have to be specific   what list?
[04:28:24] <lembron> "whatever is not allowed inside a html tag" ((and yes specifically and only speaking of the <tag> part, not attributes or innerHtml
[04:28:50] <Albright> Ahhh
[04:29:01] <coder7of9> ^a-z
[04:29:05] <Albright> So what is allowed for that? Is it just a-z?
[04:29:29] <coder7of9> preg_replace with a regex mayb
[04:29:29] <lembron> 0-9 def. too
[04:29:41] <lembron> _ as well
[04:29:41] <Albright> preg_replace_all('/[^a-z\d]/', '_', $tagName);
[04:29:49] <Albright> preg_replace_all('/[^a-z\d_]/', '_', $tagName);

[04:30:54] <lembron> guess THIS way around the list will remain managable at least :P
[04:31:07] <coder7of9> not much management
[04:31:19] <coder7of9> alphanumeric
[04:32:28] <Albright> While I *can* sympathize with the feeling of "PHP has functions to do all sorts of esoteric things so why doesn't it have a function to do this specific thing I need?"…
[04:32:49] <Albright> …PHP's standard library still *does* have limits.

[05:15:14] <__adrian> pretty sure none of those are valid

[09:30:37] <BadAdviceCat> Specifically, I mean, convert to string.
[09:30:50] <BadAdviceCat> https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.dechex.php - from int type.
[09:32:33] <BadAdviceCat> So use range, then take the RETURN VALUE of range(), and then convert.
[09:32:38] <BadAdviceCat> That's what I meant to say.

[13:21:18] <Naktibalda> paule32: that line is inside string, so it must be clearly separated from string, try {$value()}  and don't use ;
[13:21:55] <Naktibalda> paule32: what's the point of using heredoc if the only thing inside it a variable containing closure?
[13:22:22] <paule32> is it better to escape the string before return for next command ?
[13:22:29] <Naktibalda> no
[13:22:51] <Naktibalda> escape in appropriate way when you actually need that
[13:26:14] <paule32> thx, seems to work
[13:26:19] <paule32> but i get:
[13:26:20] <paule32> SyntaxError: "" string literal contains an unescaped line break
[13:27:01] <Naktibalda> then read the manual how to use heredoc syntax correctly
[13:27:24] <Naktibalda> or don't use it then you won't have such problem
[13:27:49] <TinoDidriksen> If you need multiline strings, then you need heredoc or nowdoc. But doesn't seem like you need them for that case.
[13:28:30] <Naktibalda> making random changes in the hope that you will eventually get it working is not a good approach
[13:29:51] <paule32> https://dpaste.com/8J5JLB2Y7
[13:30:13] <TinoDidriksen> Indeed. As usual paule32, it doesn't seem like you understand the basic language. You're still doing copy-paste and trial'n'error coding. Don't throw things at a wall - read and understand before applying.
[13:30:19] <paule32> the textContent there comes from callable closure $value

[14:07:39] <biberu> relipse: what do you want to test?

[14:14:06] <TinoDidriksen> paule32, again, you don't understand what you're doing. Read the PCRE docs, see their examples. The replacement is not a regex.
[14:14:53] <TinoDidriksen> Also, preg_replace() is not in-situ.
[14:16:08] <TinoDidriksen> And you got the regex syntax wrong. 3 fundamental errors in 1 line.
[14:20:05] <biberu> i don't think that loop does what you're expecting either

[21:57:31] <Blondie101010> hmmm, why do you want to use pack()?
[21:58:22] <Blondie101010> I got the impression that is NOT what you want
[21:58:31] <robert_> I want a string I can easily base64_encode that isn't a football field in length that's literally just a text field and a couple date fields. I mean json or serialize seem like overkill for that kind of thing
[21:58:49] <robert_> (date as in time())
[21:59:09] <Blondie101010> no, json_encode() and serialize() are simple options for a simple case like that
[21:59:56] <Blondie101010> pack() is meant to map data to a low level binary format as is used in C
[22:00:21] <Blondie101010> so a much more strict and elaborate format
[22:01:00] <Naktibalda> so the timestamp would take 4 bytes after pack
[22:01:07] <Blondie101010> imo that's a bad fit for your requirement
[22:01:09] <Naktibalda> it makes some sense
[22:06:31] <Blondie101010> the practical difference is that a format like JSON is easy to encode and decode in any language and is flexible, while packed data is more difficult to implement in many languages and is not flexible at all..  will the few bytes you save compensate for the many hours you'll spend on this?
[22:06:33] <Naktibalda> robert_: unpack uses different format of format string than pack, you have to give labels of elements

[22:12:41] <robert_> oh lol. I'm being silly
[22:12:53] <robert_> yeah I just realized that
