[00:13:37] <rawktucc> Good afternoon. I've found a good deal on bare 18TBs, cheaper than any retailer I can find... ships from within my country. How can someone offer one of these so low?
[00:13:50] <rawktucc> I am asking incase someone here is familiar with purchase or HDD industry. they only have 2 for sale
[00:13:59] <rawktucc> the price is 50-100$ less than anyone else and the seller is reliable

[00:33:18] <evilgohan2> hit buy
[00:33:24] <rawktucc> idk. it just seems sus
[00:34:03] <rawktucc> Estimated delivery within 12-24 business days... but it's shipping somewhere 5 hours away by car
[00:40:23] <joepie91> possibly somebody trying to get rid of stuff that's in the way, at such a low volume
[00:40:51] <joepie91> who cares more about getting it the fuck out of the door, than about getting maximum money for it
[00:41:55] <rawktucc> next question: is it worth spending a grand on two of these
[00:42:07] <rawktucc> i plan to go on vacation and pack all my shit up in about 6 months
[00:42:47] <rawktucc> in storage, to be used later possibly. M y assumption is though that HDDs retain value well even used
[00:43:07] <rawktucc> I have a hetzner lined up I'll transfer most data to for access when away from home but for now I think I could use more space
[00:43:07] <rawktucc> this is a damn expensive hobby, isn't it
[00:43:19] <joepie91> I do not share that assumption

[01:06:58] <skye0_mobile> How do I achieve the following? I'm trying to download YouTube videos from a playlist with youtube-dl in a Python script but I want to create folders containing the name of the channel and the specific playlist name. I'll provide an example
[01:07:06] <skye0_mobile> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_vi1oi60xk&list=PLLoVDOy_Em01Ru3XVfox8FRRYWn1Q8KbW
[01:07:15] <rawktucc> skye0_mobile, youtube-dl should do that though
[01:07:34] <rawktucc> Incognito Mode (UC8Q7XEy86Q7T-3kNpNjYgwA) I do this for channels
[01:07:45] <rawktucc> you could also do this in a bash script instead 
[01:07:49] <skye0_mobile> hm, i wonder what command that'll be. i'm aware that -o determines the output directory, and -i downloads all videos in a playlist
[01:08:12] <skye0_mobile> rawktucc i'd love to do it in a bash script but i'm using windows. i'm aware of WSL but it's a PITA for me to deal with atm
[01:08:16] <rawktucc> oh
[01:08:26] <rawktucc> -o "%(uploader)s (%(uploader_id)s)/%(upload_date)s - %(title)s - [%(resolution)s] [%(id)s].%(ext)s"
[01:08:40] <rawktucc> im SURE there's a way to set playlist
[01:08:43] <skye0_mobile> thanks!
[01:08:51] <skye0_mobile> found out it %(playlist)s or something
[01:09:02] <rawktucc> Yeah!

[01:09:30] <rawktucc> shouldnt even need python for this tbh

[01:09:58] <skye0_mobile> i shouldn't but i've got a bunch of other logic that requires me to use python (or bash if i used linux for this in the first place)
[01:10:26] <rawktucc> could we see perhaps? I am interested
[01:11:25] <rawktucc> Also any ZFS users: I want to setup a new server with ZFS as the root partition. Could I take full root snapshots even while running, and then send those offsite if needed for backups?

[01:23:38] <rawktucc> something like this maybe. this is probably wrong somewhere
[01:23:47] <rawktucc> write to /dev/shm so you're not adding wear to storage drives
[01:25:06] <skye0_mobile> i like how lightweight bash seems but i find python more useful especially with like AI and ML.
[01:28:47] <Hydragyrum> /dev/shm seems like an odd pick, why not use /run or smth?
[01:29:34] <rawktucc> wouldnt run still be on the HDD?
[01:29:55] <rawktucc> dev/shm would just sit in memory, it'll get blown away too whenever the system reboots.
[01:30:30] <Hydragyrum> at least on my system, /run is a tmpfs
[01:31:19] <Hydragyrum> and according to the sources I've seen, /run as tmpfs is standard
[01:31:28] <Selavi> I consider /run more for system runtime files. /dev/shm is more general purpose
[01:31:46] <Hydragyrum> I mean, /dev/shm is for shared memory
[01:32:22] <rawktucc> hm
[01:32:27] <Selavi> /dev/shm is also larger

[01:34:53] <Selavi> at any rate, I'm fine putting temp files on storage, especially small text files
[01:36:47] <Selavi> the only thing I deliberately put in RAM is Plex transcoding, and sometimes video remuxing
[01:36:59] <rawktucc> oh, that's smart. i should do that

[01:37:47] <Selavi> you mean size?
[01:37:49] <Selavi> ah, heh
[01:38:01] <rawktucc> yeah if it's a BIG video, UHD or something... just watch out
[01:38:22] <rawktucc> some remuxes have FLAC 2.0 because why leave theaudio uncompressed anyway but yeah if you're remuxing and also puttig it into shm, eh

[15:17:00] <dgcampea> hi, I'm planning a storage system build, the backplanes for the case I'm at have SATA sockets instead of the more common SAS/SFF ones
[15:18:02] <dgcampea> is there any caveat with this?
[15:19:41] <dgcampea> I'm planning to use the SATA sockets from a common X99 mATX mobo
[15:21:08] <dgcampea> the case I'm considering is the Inter-Tech 4U 4410 if that's relevant (https://www.inter-tech.de/en/products/ipc/storage-cases/4u-4410)
