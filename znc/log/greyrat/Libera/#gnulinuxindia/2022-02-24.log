[10:56:40] <Lolsomeone[m]> <sla[m]12> "htop doesn't hide any process..." <- Ohh thanks sir
[10:57:47] <Zbnssn[m]> <Looph0le[m]> "use this" <- just changed 1337x.to to another mirror that works right?
[10:58:23] <Zbnssn[m]> I still use the og site w openvpn config files they so comfy
[11:00:59] <Zbnssn[m]> <klimi[m]> "guys, do you know how to..." <- best solution is to go to your hosts file and redirect the cryptomining sites to a null server 0.0.0.0... it wouldnt connect to the server to validate, would spit out errors and stop working entirely
[11:03:06] <Zbnssn[m]> this was updated 2 months ago https://github.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list
[11:03:06] <Zbnssn[m]> if u get a more recent and one with more sites.... just copy them to ur hosts file
[11:05:51] <Zbnssn[m]> this is basically the backend for those gui extensions on browsers... it just that websites can detect whether ur blocking ads using an extention which gets v annoying to force the user to disable it... just configuring ur hosts or using a private dns server that has these on their blocklist will do great :)
[11:09:18] <Zbnssn[m]> also does anyone here use proxmox?
[11:21:53] <klimi[m]> <Zbnssn[m]> "best solution is to go to your..." <- can't this be easily beaten with a proxy?
[11:22:06] <klimi[m]> and we do want to have atrack of the records too to pursue legal actions

[13:48:54] <Zbnssn[m]> <klimi[m]> "can't this be easily beaten with..." <- if your proxy/vpn changes ur dns... which in most good vpns do... like check dnsleaktest.com before after and if it's a good vpn it should change.
[13:51:10] <Zbnssn[m]> However if you have a site blocked in your hosts file like 
[13:51:10] <Zbnssn[m]> Say a pron site..your isp already blocks it...you use a vpn and now it's accessible...
[13:51:10] <Zbnssn[m]> but if you have it in your hosts file and routed to 0.0.0.0 then even with vpn you wouldnt be able to visit the site
