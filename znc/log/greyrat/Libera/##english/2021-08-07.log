[01:44:01] <GuiToris> hello, so a few days/weeks ago we were talking about -cupboards and it turned out that linen cupboard is linen closet in AmE. I'd like to know what you store in these cupboards/closets. Clothes, underwear or linen towels only
[01:44:16] <blkshp> pants draw.
[01:44:37] <blkshp> I have no linen closet, i have an Airing cupboard.
[01:45:54] <GuiToris> the multilingual dictionary, that I use daily, says it's a storage for underwear, but the monolingual dict. says: a cupboard in which sheets are kept
[01:46:09] <blkshp> Pants draw.
[01:46:16] <GuiToris> ok, sir
[01:46:22] <blkshp> Sorry... drawer
[01:46:50] <blkshp> Wardrobe, chest of drawers, airing cupboard (where the boiler is usually kept)
[01:47:19] <GuiToris> just to be on the safe side, pants are : especially American English a piece of clothing that covers you from your waist to your feet and has a separate part for each leg SYN trousers British English
[01:47:26] <blkshp> no.
[01:47:34] <blkshp> Underwear, boxer shorts etc.
[01:47:34] *** Quits: Rashad (~textual@46.185.170.67) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[01:47:52] <blkshp> You know I'm talking England here.
[01:48:01] <GuiToris> in that case, my multilingual dictionary was right
[01:48:08] <blkshp> Well, sort of.
[01:48:25] <blkshp> Because it doesn't tell you what the UK word pants means!
[01:48:33] <GuiToris> in theory linen cupboard and linen closet are the same thing, only an ocean is the difference
[01:49:01] <blkshp> I guess so but I'm not sure I know anyone with a linen cupboard.
[01:49:19] <GuiToris> if an american was listening and disagreed with blkshp, let me know ;)
[01:49:33] <GuiToris> next word is 'head game'... I'm not sure about this
[01:49:43] <blkshp> Oh no, I don't disagree. Linen cupboard and linen closet would be the same thing.
[01:50:04] <blkshp> Just I don't think they're anywhere near as common here because significantly smaller houses
[01:50:11] <GuiToris> I meant if they stored something else in their linen closet
[01:50:26] <blkshp> Oh, i guess people would just store whatever they wanted to store.
[01:50:40] <blkshp> like how people put eggs in the fridge in the UK. Monsters.
[01:51:34] <GuiToris> I'm not sure if I've stressed it enough, but a British guy moved here a few weeks ago and I really enjoy listening to his accent. It's really posh
[01:51:41] <GuiToris> he's from Brighton
[01:52:00] <blkshp> I didn't know
[01:52:11] <blkshp> Tell him... "'allo mate"
[01:52:30] <blkshp> or "'cor blimey"
[01:52:48] <GuiToris> he invited me to have some chinwag, or I don't know how the word was used :D
[01:53:26] <blkshp> Go for a chinwag
[01:53:45] <blkshp> "he invited me for a chinwag"
[01:53:55] <GuiToris> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ maybe
[01:54:18] <blkshp> No, that is it. A chinwag is a chat.
[01:55:00] <GuiToris> he alternates between (a)pple and st(o)p sound. Half is apple, but past is stop
[01:55:17] <GuiToris> 'half past' have two different vowel sounds in his accent
[01:55:54] <blkshp> Are you sure it's not the other way around?
[01:56:14] <blkshp> I do it the other way Harlf paast.
[01:56:22] <GuiToris> umm, I don't know, I was sure until you asked me
[01:56:43] <GuiToris> but they should have the very same vowel sound
[01:56:54] <blkshp> I can't picture haalf Paast, harlf paast, harlf parst i can picture.
[01:57:19] <blkshp> No, you never use "should" for English pronunciation, you should know that by now lol
[01:57:22] <GuiToris> but I think he said 'half' sounds weird with st(o)p vowel
[01:58:04] <GuiToris> are you saying I should never correct a Britishman's pronunciation?
[01:58:26] <blkshp> I've only been there a few times and that was as a kid so their regional pronunciation is not really known however their proximity to the south east and London areas, I would be suprised.
[01:58:36] <blkshp> Yes, pretty much what I'm saying, yes!
[01:59:02] <GuiToris> I sometimes told him that those final R-s should be somewhere there, they aren't meant to be swallowed
[01:59:15] <GuiToris> betta'

[02:01:51] <GuiToris> sweeet
[02:01:59] <blkshp> From Brighton to simplified English ;P
[02:02:32] <GuiToris> no chap... your English isn't simplified at all
[02:02:49] <blkshp> Only because I try to stretch you
[02:02:59] <blkshp> For the moment a British person moves into the area.... oh wait.
[02:03:22] <GuiToris> I don't stretch, I tear
[02:03:23] <blkshp> I just learned a new word.
[02:03:28] <blkshp> Carhop
[02:03:40] <GuiToris> is this something that Harry Potter do?
[02:03:51] <huf> nerf carh
[02:03:53] <blkshp> No, it's someone in the US that serves food that you've ordered to your car.
[02:03:57] <blkshp> WE don't have that.
[02:04:03] <GuiToris> !d carhop
[02:04:10] <tinsoldier> carhop — Noun: 1. (US) A waiter or waitress who serves customers, especially in their vehicles, at a drive-in restaurant, sometimes on rollerskates., — Verb: 1. (intransitive) To work as a carhop. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/carhop
[02:05:26] <GuiToris> it's not even in Merriam-Webster
[02:05:42] <blkshp> We also don't use "raincheck"
[02:05:55] <GuiToris> I heard that one
[02:08:12] <GuiToris> blkshp, oh, before you leave unexpectedly, can we discuss what 'head game' is? I read some descriptions but I didn't understand them well. Is it when the boy or the girl try to tyrannize the other half?
[02:09:01] <blkshp> it's a nice word for potentially long term deception, possibly with implements.
[02:09:30] <GuiToris> if you use fancier words than the dictionary, it won't help
[02:09:51] <blkshp> Imagine someone taking something out of someone's house and then suggesting they lost it, or saying things and then pretending it didn't happen.

[02:10:54] <bin> So the context is really important
[02:11:00] <GuiToris> I have a little
[02:11:29] <blkshp> We don't want to know ;)
[02:11:38] <GuiToris> bin, She said something like 'I'm looking for a decent man, I'm fed up with head games'
[02:11:52] <GuiToris> I looked up 'head game' but I'm not sure what she meant
[02:12:12] <GuiToris> was her last partner way too bossy?
[02:12:16] <blkshp> Not being truthful to get sympathetic reaction
[02:12:27] <Inhahe> head  games = mind games
[02:12:35] <Inhahe> psychological manipulation
[02:13:49] <bin> In that context it usually means a guy that's playing with your feelings, saying he's interested but really isn't, lying about things, hiding things
[02:14:20] <GuiToris> so he was a dishonest person, that's not what I imagined

[07:59:34] <soulisson> Hello
[08:06:17] <soulisson> I have a question. In the context of computing ("network/vulnerability/port scanner" or av) does scanning means to performs some operations in order to get some data and in that regards it's similar to what medical scanners do?
[08:12:17] <ksft> yeah, pretty similar

[22:54:04] <huf> because you're on a network
[22:54:05] <LjL> i don't think i've ever seen anyone (except you now) using "at" for the network
[22:54:37] <StayHungry> never claimed 'at' for the network :)
[22:54:51] <huf> >>> so you're at Libera chat. <<<
[22:54:54] <LjL> ↑
[22:55:07] <huf> jerry springer meme
[22:55:08] <TechTest> you are usually *on* a server, but *in* a channel, though since the channel is also on the server saying you are *on* a channel maybe isn't entirely wrong
[22:55:17] <StayHungry> gosh... you missed 'IRC as a hotel or a meeting (location, not activity)' part
[22:55:36] <StayHungry> there are old school, pre-IT ways to perceive things
[22:55:36] <LjL> i didn't miss it
[22:55:37] <huf> yeah, but it aint any of those things
[22:56:02] <LjL> if you consider IRC as being with other people, then you are with Libera chat
[22:56:08] <LjL> </StayHungry>
[22:56:11] <huf> :D
[22:56:26] <huf> and we all know what happens if it's a grue
[22:56:40] <StayHungry> chat is in pre-digital terms of a meeting, a gathering
[22:56:41] <huf> it *is* dark on irc after all :)
[22:57:05] <StayHungry> aggrrh, auto-complete failed
[22:57:31] <StayHungry> in pre-digital terms chat is a meeting, a gathering
[22:57:57] <StayHungry> a party
[22:58:24] <huf> how is that relevant to this specific meaning of chat then?
[22:58:37] <huf> for example, in french, you'd pet the cat
[22:58:40] <huf> *chat
[22:59:11] <StayHungry> it means there is no shame to say i'm in #english at libera (however on libera is more common)
[22:59:23] <huf> of course there's no shame
[22:59:33] <huf> it's just that I've never seen anyone say that except you here now
[22:59:35] <huf> in 10+ years of irc
[23:00:00] <huf> can you show us a native english speaking community that regularly says it like that?
[23:00:35] <huf> huh, more like 20
[23:05:19] <StayHungry> why? there's no mistake here, and logic behind is explained with examples. i don't see either 'sir' or 'comrade' is a way to address others on IRC (being its user from 1995-6), but use them myself extensively (being old school). 
[23:05:31] <huf> ?
[23:05:37] <huf> logic is irrelevant
[23:05:43] <huf> you cant just prove that something is correct
[23:06:00] <huf> and why are you bringing completely unrelated things into this *again*?
[23:09:48] * LuisP14 is with their point
[23:17:33] <StayHungry> huf: preposition 'at' is used related to time, places, events. chat is both place and event. like party, meeting, gathering, hotel, McDonald's. since there is no rule that prescribes using 'on' related to chats, i see no grounds for a dispute. nobody attacks your experience if that matters.
[23:17:54] <huf> StayHungry: yeah, that's not how this works
[23:18:02] <huf> can you show us examples of people saying it like this?

[23:23:50] <StayHungry> huf: argument of online frequency is not how it works either. how frequently adult males are addressed as sirs? you cannot answer that simply because there is no corpus of indexed online messaging to relate to. you can only refer to a narrow scope of memory of yours and that of colleagues. in the end, is it a mistake or 'i don't see it often'?
[23:24:10] <huf> no, I can search about things
[23:24:23] <huf> but also, there's no special usage of "sir" online AFAIK
[23:24:34] <huf> and the usage of "sir" is very well attested 
[23:25:15] <huf> and you _definitely_ cant prove correct preposition usage from definitions, that's silly
[23:25:22] <huf> prepositions are at least half-arbitrary
[23:26:03] <huf> it *is* telling that instead of finding examples of people saying it like this, you keep deflecting :)
[23:28:29] <StayHungry> in the beginning, i explained there are options related to chats. less common and more common. one of those options is not a mistake to refute, or is it? you keep silent about that. instead you're nitpicking about 'how common is that less common'.
[23:28:36] <StayHungry> *there were
[23:28:49] <huf> no, I'm asking you to show me that it actually exists
[23:28:58] <huf> you keep saying less common but has anyone other than you seen it?
[23:29:01] <huf> have you seen it?
[23:33:21] <StayHungry> of course, in the end I learn by observing, not imagining. but i can't refer to a particular time or space, because you asked specifically about native English community, whereas usually e-communication has no such fingerprint. perhaps some non-native like me used 'at' in such a manner, then you would say 'not accepted'.
[23:34:23] <huf> yeah, I wouldnt trust us non natives about shit like this. this is why examples of real world usage (found with google) would help
[23:34:34] <huf> if you said they say it like that in, eg. singapore, I'd go huh. cool.
[23:34:38] <huf> I'll watch out for it
[23:34:43] <huf> or whatever
[23:36:11] <LjL> ugh
[23:37:13] <LjL> language doesn't work by "logic" or "rules". we use those things to try to explain what language does, but they are not what *defines* it and makes things "correct". only actual usage does. you two seem to have completely different viewpoints on this matter, the important difference being that huf's one is the one also endorsed by most modern linguists.
[23:38:24] <huf> there are so many communities all over the world speaking english of some sort natively
[23:38:29] <huf> it's entirely possible that some say it like this
[23:39:02] <huf> on the other hand, this is an internetty word... but then, I havent visited all the pits of the internet
[23:39:26] <huf> not even google has done that :)
[23:40:49] <huf> I mean... "bepis" means either "pepsi" or "penis" in some stupid subreddit, I forget which
[23:40:58] <huf> but at least it's attested usage!
[23:41:32] <LjL> attested, yet contested and detested
[23:41:36] <huf> :)
[23:41:51] <huf> the english pronunciation video that started it all is _art_

[23:44:47] <huf> this is a different meaning?
[23:45:32] <StayHungry> a page from the book 'Space in Language and Linguistics' about chats: https://shiny.link/kfw1No
[23:47:32] <LjL> das ist jedoch nicht über Englisch
[23:47:35] <StayHungry> enough to let you see there are grounds to what i said, not just pure logic speculations.
[23:47:39] <huf> and also I cant find that phrase in there
[23:47:49] <huf> no wait, there is
[23:47:50] <StayHungry> huf: last paragraph
[23:48:17] <LjL> "pointing at" is an entirely different usage from what we were discussing
[23:48:20] <huf> yeah
[23:48:33] <huf> I found it at least, dunno why google was unable to hilight it...
[23:48:59] <huf> also wasnt this written by germans? :D
[23:49:12] * LuisP14 points to LjL

[23:50:53] * LjL has an internet body extender
[23:50:57] <huf> you'd need very long arms anyway
[23:51:04] <huf> even with an extender... it's tricky
