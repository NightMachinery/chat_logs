[19:00:40] <gxt> How can I find scrollbar styling in the firefox devtools? Can I select scrollbars somewhere like pseudo elements? I'm trying to debug why the scrollbar is a weird color on a site and can't find the declarations.
[19:01:14] <gxt> I'm currently fiddling with overriding `scrollbar-color` on elements and toggling my inserted rules on and off to see when it changes, but it's … not ideal :P
[19:02:05] <gxt> You can use this as minimum reproducible example, just paste into addressbar: data:text/html,<html style="height:200vh;scrollbar-color:fuchsia lime">
[19:03:48] <hassoon> gxt: where is the site
[19:04:46] <gxt> hassoon: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/mmref/lang.html
[19:04:58] *** Parts: Haunted330 (~Haunted33@user/haunted330) ()
[19:05:18] <gxt> The scroll-thumb is just barely lighter than the scroll-track for me (maybe due to dark-theme, that's what I wanted to debug).
[19:07:16] <hassoon> is this what you are getting ? https://i.imgur.com/temVqGx.png
[19:08:01] <hassoon> gxt: *
[19:19:10] <gxt> hassoon: No, looks like this for me https://ga.ldor.de/tmp/firefox-scrollbar-color.png
[19:21:06] <gxt> But my question was meant more generally, so the data url example should be sufficient. I would like to know where I can see scrollbar styles in the devtools in general, not where they are on this specific page.
[19:22:03] *** Quits: adroitmachine_ (~adroitmac@182.64.104.84) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[19:23:54] <hassoon> gxt: i could change only the colors and the thickness of the scrollbar so far, but the options are very limited in firefox https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/23
[19:24:13] <hassoon> unless you go for a full-blown custom scrollbar solution using javacript
[19:24:36] <gxt> Yes, I know how to change them, you are misunderstanding my question, let me try to rephrase.
[19:25:12] <gxt> You come across a website with changed scrollbar styling, now you want to check where those styles are in the css. You do not want to change them further.
[19:25:49] <gxt> Like how when you see a red headline and want to see why it's red, you right-click -> inspect it and can quickly find the exact line of css that causes it.
[19:25:57] <hassoon> ah
[19:26:36] <gxt> It's nothing important though, was mostly just curious. I'll just create a Stylus Userstyle to override it for now :)
[19:27:33] <hassoon> if we are seening the same website, but got different scrollbar styles, then either the native OS-imposed style is used for each one of us, otherwise you are using a custom firefox theme
[19:27:33] <gxt> Back when Chrome still supported scrollbar-color it had the scrollbars available in the devtools similar to how ::before and ::after are shown when they exist.
[19:27:43] <hassoon> * seeing *
[19:28:09] <gxt> It is only that website though, every other website I have open has my default scrollbar which is exactly like in your screenshot

[19:33:19] <hassoon> ah makes sense
[19:33:44] <hassoon> no i mean.. some interference with one of your browser extensions ?
[19:34:15] <gxt> I found it! It's a rule in view-source:https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/_static/classic.css setting `html {background-color: #FFFFFF}`
[19:34:25] <hassoon> anyway the scrollable-element's style should contain the scrollbar style, still weird how you haven't found it
[19:34:26] <gxt> When I toggle that rule of in the inspector, the scrollbar turns normal
[19:34:37] <hassoon> ah
[19:34:48] <gxt> I tested this in a clean profile with no extensions besides uBlock Origin
[19:35:09] <gxt> For you toggling the background-color of html does not change the scrollbar?
[19:36:28] <hassoon> ya weird, that should have nothing to do with the scrollbar
[19:36:59] <gxt> I would never have guessed, if not for the comment: /* CSS hack for macOS's scrollbar (see #1125) */
[19:37:14] <hassoon> you're on a mac machine ?
[19:37:20] <gxt> No, Linux
[19:37:30] <hassoon> same, debian
[19:37:46] <gxt> Firefox 98 under Wayland (sway)
[19:43:41] <hassoon> 78.15.0esr (64-bit)
[19:50:51] <gxt> Ok I debugged some further, this is really strange behavior by Firefox, apparently it depends on the lightness of the body background-color whether the scrollbar is transparent and you can see the html background-color through it
[19:52:16] <gxt> Open this example and then play with the background-color of body: data:text/html,<html style="background:lime"><body style="margin:0;height:200vh;background-color:green">
[19:53:22] <gxt> If you click the color dot next to the background color and drag the color around in the color picker, you can observe how for dark backgrounds the scrollbar is transparent, for light ones it turns opaque.
[19:53:56] <gxt> hassoon: Can you confirm that behavior?

[21:46:05] <DPA> If I could somehow free up the ::after pseudo elements, then I could use those. I use ::before and ::after because I need a line on both sides of the elements.
[21:46:05] <DPA> I experimented with making it 1 line going all the way through, but I couldn't get the pseudo element drawing the line behind it's containing element, so I couldn't hide that part this way.

[23:18:26] <DPA> I kind of found a way now, but it's a horrible hack: https://jsfiddle.net/yzo68g3L/17/
[23:18:26] <DPA> Basically, I set "z-index: -1" on the ::before, but none of the parent elements. That puts it behind all other element, except html & body. But I can then make it draw things independently of a parent element using "contain: paint;". That way, I can put the line in front of some other parent element with a background, but behind the element the ::before belongs to.
[23:18:26] <DPA> Does anyone know if this is the best way to do this? And can I rely on this working, now and in the future, in all browsers?

[23:41:26] <gxt> You might have to hack around though in case you're creating stacking contexts you can't escape out of with z-index somewhere.
[23:43:04] <DPA> Well, that's what I'm doing now. And I'm intentionally creating stacking contexts using the "contain" property to limit how far up it can go. But it feels a bit hacky.

[23:43:56] <gxt> Didn't read the full scrollback before experimenting and writing that message, sorry :)
[23:44:53] <gxt> It might be a bit hacky, but considering the overall approach you're taking, I would say it only marginally increases the overall hackiness factor haha
