[00:17:18] <antto> so, znc --makeconf, it started asking me things.. listen port, ssl, username and now a password
[00:17:34] <antto> does this password need to be uber fancy if i'll only connect via ssl?
[00:17:41] <MetaNova> no
[00:17:54] <MetaNova> you can even connect later with a client cert/no password
[00:23:31] <antto> aww, znc suggest a network like freenope :~(
[00:23:47] <antto> who knew..
[00:24:09] <antto> i guess that's changed in the latest version
[00:24:39] <MetaNova> as far as I know freenode is still the default network/suggestion even in git master
[00:24:52] <antto> oh
[00:25:23] <antto> hm, i guess it was the hexchat folks who were discussing adding libera and making it default
[00:25:23] <MetaNova> since the primary #znc channel is now on libera that might be worth changing
[00:25:58] <MetaNova> hexchat committed libera to the server.conf/network list in git master the day of/after libera.chat went live
[00:26:25] <MetaNova> so, distro packages should reflect that when new builds/revisions are made
[00:26:41] <MetaNova> Windows users won't see that reflected until 2.14.4 becomes available
[00:27:56] <antto> meh, who even uses windows ;P~
[00:29:35] <antto> so, i added a network to the conf, it asks me if i want to launch it
[00:29:49] <antto> but i think i wanna set it up to launch automatically on start
[00:29:59] <MetaNova> you can say yes to launch ZNC now or launch it later with $ znc
[00:30:15] <antto> found this: https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#How_can_I_restart_ZNC_automatically_.28in_case_of_a_machine_reboot.2C_crash.2C_etc..29.3F
[00:30:26] <antto> but it says the package from debian doesn't work :/
[00:30:45] <MetaNova> if you just want persistence when the */10 cronjob is easiest
[00:31:18] <antto> i went to type that command actually, and it auto-completed znc.service
[00:31:28] <antto> huh, maybe it's there?

[01:08:18] <MetaNova> and if you installed the unit file (and activated it), service znc status?

[01:11:11] <antto> now the systemctl status prints stuff, it failed to activate
[01:11:16] <MetaNova> well
[01:11:20] <MetaNova> take a look at the unit file
[01:11:27] <MetaNova> it should contain, among other things:
[01:11:32] <MetaNova> -the correct system user
[01:11:37] <MetaNova> -the correct executable path

[01:11:43] <MetaNova> -the correct DATADIR path
[01:11:54] <MetaNova> you likely need to edit it
[01:12:26] <antto> when i installed znc, apt mentioned that a user "_znc" has been created
[01:13:06] <Mathisen> grouo not user
[01:13:10] <MetaNova> packaged versions of ZNC can attempt to create a system user and put the config inside /var/lib for use as a system service
[01:13:18] <Mathisen> group*
[01:13:39] <MetaNova> you doing --makeconf yourself made me think you wanted to configure ZNC normally
[01:14:02] <antto> i don't know what i'm doing.. i followed the wiki which said to --makeconf
[01:14:19] <antto> perhaps i should've checked debian wiki for znc

[01:22:00] <antto> hm, unit file is /lib/systemd/system/znc.service .. when enabled, a symlink to it is created

[01:25:28] <antto> does this means the .conf should be in /var/lib/znc/ ?
[01:25:54] <MetaNova> personally I'd just edit the unit file so that the datadir points to /home/user/.znc and User matches the system user you used to run --makeconf
[01:25:57] <MetaNova> and call it a day
[01:26:16] <MetaNova> instead of trying to fix a broken ZNC installed-as-a-service

[01:41:04] <r00tobo> debian package uses _znc user you could use sudo -u _znc inside /var/lib/znc and do sudo -u _znc znc --makeconf
[01:41:29] <r00tobo> it will create the configs and the systemd service will start working after that
[01:44:12] <r00tobo> as for the ufw yes you just have to allow the znc port 
[01:44:28] <MetaNova> znc/webadmin, whatever port you configured ZNC to listen on
[01:44:49] <r00tobo> in the --makeconf process

[01:49:09] <r00tobo> <antto> okay, does # work as a line comment in these .service files? ;P~ <--- I will answer that, yes it works as a line comment
[01:49:53] <antto> i modified the znc.service file
[01:50:04] <antto> perhaps.. this isn't great
[01:50:48] <MetaNova> r00tobo: sudo -u _znc /usr/bin/znc --datadir=/var/lib/znc --makeconf
[01:51:15] <r00tobo> If I were you I would just install the znc package and use it directly with a created user without using systemd 
[01:51:37] <MetaNova> doing --makeconf without --datadir relies on whatever $HOME equates to
[01:51:41] <r00tobo> MetaNova: thanks for the correction
[01:51:51] <MetaNova> unreliable with intended-to-be-ran-as-a-service users
[01:52:30] <r00tobo> you mean using znc directly with a user ? 
[01:52:38] <r00tobo> or without --datadir ?
[01:53:19] <MetaNova> when ZNC is installed from package sometimes the postinstall configuration includes a system user, an already-generated conf?, and a unit file or so
[01:53:32] <r00tobo> an example from /etc/passwd for the _znc user created from the debian package _znc:x:109:116::/var/lib/znc:/usr/sbin/nologin
[01:53:39] <MetaNova> I consider "normal" usage to have ZNC installed and run 'znc --makeconf' as the system user you intend to run ZNC as
[01:53:43] <r00tobo> the $home is /var/lib/znc

[01:55:31] <antto> i wanna do it the least ugly way coz eventually this package will get updated via apt.. i don't wanna break my bouncer
[01:55:42] <MetaNova> besides, you're intention is to mirror the existing unit file contents, best way to replicate the settings is explicit
[01:56:14] <MetaNova> antto: version upgrades by package should be seamless
[01:56:28] <MetaNova> except for third-party modules which you'd need to recompile anyway
[01:56:47] <antto> but i modified /lib/systemd/system/znc.service
[01:57:07] <antto> my nose tells me this file could get updated/reinstalled by apt
[01:57:13] <MetaNova> if you're afraid of it getting overwritten, make a backup
[01:57:19] <MetaNova> restore from backup if it gets modified?
[01:57:30] <antto> :/
[01:57:45] <antto> isn't there some more elegant way?
[01:58:14] <MetaNova> the point is to make it work; you edit the unit file to suit your system/intended usage, or you make sure the user/datadir/binpath is correct in the unit file as specified

[01:58:32] <r00tobo> I used to install the znc package from debian and all I did was doing sudo -u _znc znc --makeconf of course when I did that it did create .znc so using --datadir is important so after the initial configuration I moved the data to /var/lib/znc and the systemd service worked fine

[22:52:53] <fhemberger> Hi, as soon as I startup irssi and it connects to znc, I get "<alt nick>: No such channel". It only happens when I connect to znc but I can't find any mention of my alt nick in either znc or irssi except where it belongs. Also didn't find anything on google. Am I missing something?
[22:53:44] <fhemberger> just wondering what's going on ...

[22:58:37] <jaggz> DarthGandalf, got it working

[23:16:56] <fhemberger> ok, checked the debug log, I just get "IRC -> ZNC [:sodium.libera.chat 403 fhemberger fhemberger_ :No such channel]" - using sasl to log in
[23:17:54] <sheep> what command was sent before that?
[23:19:19] <fhemberger> CLI -> ZNC [MODE fhemberger_ +i]
[23:20:04] <sheep> you probably have a perform command set to use the wrong nick or something
[23:20:37] <sheep> check /znc *perform list

[23:22:28] <Casper> Yeah, you'll want %nick% in perform, not a hard nick.
[23:24:04] <fhemberger> I'm not using the perform module
[23:25:19] <MetaNova> irssi has its own set of autoperform commands
[23:30:43] <fhemberger> nothing configured in irssi as well
