[22:57:43] <jan6> I want to set up my own mail server, and just wondering, if my IP is in UCEPROTECTL3 blacklist, how much is it gonna affect me (assuming it won't clear up)? it's the only blacklist mxtoolbox.com finds me on (IP only, very cheap VPS provider, so no surprise)
[22:58:36] <jan6> I have no idea which lists are significant and widely-used, and which aren't
[23:01:36] <rob0> uceprotect is not widely used
[23:01:59] <rob0> but big hosters/receivers all maintain their own lists
[23:02:32] <rob0> and you might have trouble (but certainly not because of uceprotect)
[23:02:42] <rob0> !fcrdns
[23:02:43] <dig-dug> rob0: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP. This is very important if you want big sites to accept your mail. If you can't have it from your ISP, see !relayhost
[23:02:59] <rob0> !deliverability
[23:03:01] <dig-dug> rob0: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each ESP that
[23:03:02] <dig-dug> rob0: you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[23:04:17] <rob0> Probably the only people using uceprotect are beginners who get excited about blocking spam, so they add every DNSBL they can find.
[23:06:06] <echoSMILE> rob0: about forged addresses, DKIM protected about it ?
