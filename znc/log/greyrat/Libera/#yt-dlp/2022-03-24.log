[12:57:21] <opal> brianx one solution is to try -j switch to dump json and then parse that
[12:58:20] <brianx> opal: the problem isn't that i can't get the data, it's that it's downloading a meg of data per video.  that makes it really slow.
[12:59:55] <opal> yeah idk a faster way
[13:00:28] <opal> is the meg of data per vid from the webpage itself? idk how big youtube replies are, never actually bothered to check
[13:01:39] <brianx> yeah, it makes a zillion requests even though the list of videos seems to be in the first few requests and handful of K of data.

[13:05:00] <brianx> a channel with 140 videos took: real	3m14.180s
[13:11:49] <brianx> when i pulled https://www.youtube.com/c/HuygensOptics/videos and told it to save the dump files, then listed the files in date order searching for one of the videos, it was in the first dump.  i searched the oldest and newest videos and they were both in the first two files dumped.
[13:42:54] <brianx> opal: yes, the meg of data per vid from the webpage itself.  no video is downloaded.
[15:18:39] <opal> damn
[15:22:28] <brianx> thanks for at least comiserating opal. :-)
[15:28:50] <brianx> i did some research and found some options to limit output with --print, and i tried -j and -J with no speedup.
[15:31:27] <brianx> also ddug through a bunch of reddit posts, several people mentioned the slowness but no real answers to that part.  nobody tried the --write-pages and noted the info was in the first little bit of the downloaded data.
