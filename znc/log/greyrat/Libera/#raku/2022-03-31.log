[01:10:18] <Altreus> Drawing a single month was quite easy, though
[01:10:32] <japhb> Voldenet: Note the week-year there
[01:10:46] <japhb> Altreus: yup.  :-)
[01:12:01] <Voldenet> Sure, there is logic to it
[01:12:23] <japhb> Altreus:  Little tip I noticed when preparing for internationalization: enum WeekStartDay < Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday >; my $week-start = Monday; my @headers = @day-names.rotate($week-start);
[01:13:25] <japhb> Turns out weeks are really odd things in some cultures.  This one amazed me: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawukon_calendar
[01:14:02] <Voldenet> I'd probably use some different property names though, like { .iso-week-year .iso-week-number }
[01:14:41] <japhb> (My tool needs to do tabular reports across the days of a week, but there are at least 4 major international conventions for starting day of the week.)
[01:16:03] <japhb> Voldenet: Sure.  Raku uses ISO standards for Date and Time where appropriate, so that's the default for such things where it would otherwise be ambiguous.
[01:16:23] <Voldenet> otoh .week-number makes no sense without that iso definition
[01:17:31] <japhb> There are some other possible conventions, but yeah, there's a reason we use the ISO def.
[01:20:48] <guifa> japhb voldenet: I couldn't even hard code stuff for Intl::Format::DateTime.  to calculate the week number, I need to know minimum days in a week to be a year start, and the first day of the week in the local system
[01:21:30] <guifa> so for a first-week-with-thursday, assuming a Sunday-first system, the minimum days would be 3, but on a Monday-first system, it would be 4
[01:24:15] <japhb> guifa: Yeah.  The tool I'm working on uses partial weeks (if necessary) at start and end of each month, kinda the way a calendar would, but has to care about ISO week as well, so ends up doing some funky figuring to use two somewhat incompatible views on the same thing.
[01:25:55] <japhb> I ended up defining a DateInterval role stubbing the methods I actually needed, and then implementing in several classes for different ways of looking at dates, so the rest of the code can just pass around DateInterval:D and pretend those weird humans aren't so weird after all.
[01:27:19] <Voldenet> The biggest problem is that dateish objects can't have useful weeks and weekdays without knowing locale
[01:28:32] <guifa> Voldenet: User::Language :-)
[01:29:03] <guifa> err, Intl::UserLanguage but I'm transitioning it to User::Language in my next update
[01:29:13] <Voldenet> User's language is not locale
[01:30:38] <Voldenet> It's actually pain when applications use locale as language and vice versa
[01:33:43] <Voldenet> Locale is the thing that decides where your weekday starts, language decides what's its name
[01:33:45] <guifa> Voldenet: the two have been overlapped forever
[01:34:20] <guifa> UserLanguage reports the most complete BCP47 tag that it can, including T and U extensions that include information about, e.g., calendar type and weekday starts
[01:35:08] <guifa> unfortunately, I can only grab so much of it from command lines, and I'll probably have to start using native call soon to probe the OS a bit more
[01:35:10] <[Coke]> I have worked on a project where available languages included "english", "french canadian", and "german", which bugged me.
[01:35:57] *** Quits: epony (epony@user/epony) (Quit: QUIT)
[01:36:09] <japhb> If it's a language, it would need to be "Canadian French" I would assume?  Because "French Canadian" sounds like it refers to a population group, not a language.
[01:36:44] <[Coke]> It's the codes, not these words.
[01:37:02] <japhb> (And I don't even know what the official designation of that population group would be officially, actually.)
[01:37:15] <japhb> Ah
[01:37:34] <[Coke]> the important part being that one is tied to a country but the others aren't.
[01:37:43] <[Coke]> (which could make sense, but not in our case.)
[01:37:55] <japhb> Yeah, gotcha.
[01:39:07] <Voldenet> Maybe US English would've be better, but German German is a bit difficult to look at

[19:32:21] <lizmat> possibly... there's even a MoarVM branch to use libgmp internally, which would make things even simpler

[19:46:55] <stanrifkin> get an error when installing Inline::Perl5
[19:47:00] <stanrifkin> relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `PL_opargs' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
[19:47:28] <stanrifkin> something wrong with the newest perl5.34.1 and raku distributions?
[19:48:35] <stanrifkin> i use perlbrew and it seems that the archive libperl.a is not compiled with -fPIC
[19:53:13] <drakonis> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4835 huh well.
[19:55:20] <stanrifkin> nothing to do with tail call optimization. I didn't realize raku doesn't have that.
[19:56:13] <stanrifkin> ok perl has no TCO either... i see
[19:57:09] * lizmat still fails to understand why some people seem to dismiss a language because it does not appear to have tail call optimizations
[19:57:34] <lizmat> whereas Raku has a more general automatic inlining of hot code
[19:59:14] <ugexe> i wonder how many people who proclaim such a desire for TCO have actually blown a stack before
[19:59:38] <ugexe> dont get me wrong, having TCO would be awesome
[20:01:00] <stanrifkin> lizmat: some problems are recursive naturally and hard or not possible iterative. but that doesn't mean someone "dismiss" a language because of the lack of TCO
[20:02:07] <Altreus> Is this normal? In month-as-table, if I do it this way, all weeks are the same; presumably the assignment to @week is done by reference and the @month array therefore gets changed --> https://gist.github.com/Altreus/8d797886a34afe219762f08d6719c899
[20:02:09] <El_Che> doesn't perl stops you at 100 recursive loop?
[20:02:20] <stanrifkin> lizmat: but when i think about it. TCO possible problems should be no recursive either.
[20:03:00] <Altreus> But if I use gather/take, it works as expected (gist updated)
[20:03:44] <Altreus> I didn't expect any reference behaviour here at all
[20:04:11] <ugexe> did you mean to use append?
[20:04:34] <ugexe> i guess not
[20:04:42] <Altreus> no I want an AoA
[20:04:54] <Altreus> I mean, I do prefer gather/take!

[23:27:41] <stanrifkin> content matters right?
[23:28:30] <lichtkind> exactly
[23:30:06] <stanrifkin> did some c++ wxwidget stuff. but experimenting things out with perl seems like a good idea. can than implement it later in c++.
[23:30:25] <lichtkind> then you look into xrc
[23:30:49] <lichtkind> you c++ app loads same xrc file and looks same
[23:30:57] <lichtkind> also helps with i18n
