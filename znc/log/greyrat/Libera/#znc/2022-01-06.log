[03:19:52] <jcbjoe2021> using *clientbuffer is a god send but sometimes its hella slow to load channels cause its getting all the backlog
[03:20:14] <jcbjoe2021> anyway to speed it up? i can wait dosent matter just wondering
[03:20:38] <bookworm> yes, reduce the buffer amount / speed up the client / speed up the network
[03:20:40] <bookworm> take your pick
[03:25:18] <jcbjoe2021> oh so instead of 5000 do like 1000 ?
[03:25:49] <bookworm> the buffer is per channel
[03:25:55] <bookworm> do you really need 5k messages?
[03:26:23] <bookworm> if all you ever read is 1 or 2 screen full, send one or two screen's worth of text
[03:26:37] <jcbjoe2021> ok
[03:26:44] <jcbjoe2021> i will reduce it

[19:36:22] <MetaNova> it's available in the development branch / git master
[19:36:59] <MetaNova> personally I feel that one feature alone is worth compiling from source
[19:37:04] <Luke> Ah right - I had assumed there'd been a release from master in the last 14 months
[19:37:49] <MetaNova> 1.8.2 is from Sep 7, 2020
[19:37:57] <MetaNova> there have been many changes since then
[19:38:27] <MetaNova> Luke: in my opinion you should just run git master
[19:38:53] <MetaNova> I've used the development branch as my version since the 1.5.x (1.4 stable) days
[19:38:58] <MetaNova> it has never crashed
[19:38:58] <Luke> I'm no longer an admin on that system so I don't have the agency to compile it from source. I could suggest they run that (it's on Arch so there's likely a znc-git package)
[19:39:03] <Luke> Good to know!
[19:39:13] <MetaNova> do you have shell access?
[19:39:29] <MetaNova> assuming the build dependencies are met, you can just install to your home directory
[19:39:34] *** Joins: theZoMBiE (~paws@user/thezombie)
[19:39:41] <MetaNova> no need for privileged access to the system
[19:40:24] <Luke> I *could*, I just like not having to deal with it :P
[19:40:52] <MetaNova> ah. well. IMO it's virtually painless
[19:41:21] <MetaNova> it's like compiling from source except with --prefix=$HOME/bin (or such)
[19:41:40] <MetaNova> s/source/source normally/
[19:41:40] <ZNC-Linker> MetaNova meant: ‚Äúit's like compiling from source normally except with --prefix=$HOME/bin (or such)‚Äù
[19:42:18] <MetaNova> it's what all the xshellz users do when they want to use a version newer than
[19:42:21] * MetaNova checks notes
[19:42:27] <MetaNova> 1.6.5 o.O
[19:43:16] <Luke> Yeah I've used that for other things I've wanted to run on systems without root, but in this case if someone else is administering it I'm happy to have one fewer thing to look after
[19:43:23] <bookworm> the problem with local installs like that is that they are untracked... meaning you are at the mercy of the authors that the uninstall target actually cleans up properly and updates don't leave orphaned files everywhere
[19:43:48] <bookworm> meaning I prefer to build a proper package myself
[19:43:57] <MetaNova> that's true, but who actually uses "make uninstall" anyway
[19:44:27] <bookworm> hence using a third party tracking tool :)
[19:44:39] <MetaNova> besides, if you're actually installing to $HOME there are no lingering system files to forget about
[19:44:46] *** Quits: sleo (~sleo@user/sleo) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[19:44:56] <bookworm> there will never be lingering system files
[19:44:56] <MetaNova> bookworm: oh, you mean like
[19:44:57] <MetaNova> uhm
[19:45:06] <bookworm> checkinstall for deb like systems
[19:45:07] <theZoMBiE> my server has multiple IPs. i set my znc on say 1.1.1.1, i connect my irc client to it. but when i am connected on liberachat i want my user to show up with ip 2.2.2.2. what is the command for this?
[19:45:12] <bookworm> makepkg for Arch
[19:45:34] <Luke> theZoMBiE: I think that's BindHost?
[19:45:43] <MetaNova> that is a bindhost question
[19:45:59] <MetaNova> theZoMBiE: what do you mean "I set my ZNC on 1.1.1.1"?
[19:46:10] <MetaNova> you told ZNC to listen on that IP?
[19:46:25] <Luke> Yes I believe you'd set your bindhost on either liberachat network or your znc user to 2.2.2.2
[19:46:27] <MetaNova> because there are actually two very different "bindhost"s
[19:46:28] <theZoMBiE> yes it listen on that ip
[19:46:55] <MetaNova> theZoMBiE: okay, let's assume you understand the difference between a listening bindhost and an user/network bindhost
[19:47:23] <MetaNova> if the machine actually owns 1.1.1.1 as well as 2.2.2.2 you would set either your user bindhost, or the bindhost for that network, to 2.2.2.2
[19:47:41] <theZoMBiE> ok thanx
[19:48:02] <theZoMBiE> yea i just tried it, setbindhost did the trick
[19:48:09] <Luke> yay :)
[19:48:30] <Luke> we had to add extra IPs because we had too many people connecting to freenode (rip) from one IP
[19:49:42] <bookworm> >Add support for cap account-tag \o/
[19:49:50] <bookworm> guess I do need to run the git version as well
[19:50:35] <MetaNova> honestly the only issue I've ever had with git master is that the webadmin templating/CSS stuff was a bit broken at a time
[19:50:51] <MetaNova> table contents expanding far beyond where they should and whatnot
[19:50:59] <MetaNova> that's literally the only problem I've had lol

[21:02:38] <MetaNova> sokan: there is no need to use a non-admin user for regular use
[21:03:49] <MetaNova> but if you really want to, just add a new user like you would at any other time

[21:23:00] <Gnuman> sokan, it means IP address 192.168.1.111, port 20000, SSL
[21:23:39] <Gnuman> activate SSL, or don't activate it. It's your choice. Just make the client match the server port and SSL-ness
[21:23:39] <sokan> So I must activate SSL on current setup in order to connect
[21:24:29] <Gnuman> well, either that or disable SSL on weechat. It's really your choice.
[21:26:31] <sokan> Gnuman: wait. So I have to enable the module SSL in order to connect via SASL on a specific network.
[21:26:34] <sokan> (like libera)
[21:27:24] <DarthGandalf> Khaytsus: it has this option of configurable skin
[21:27:49] <Gnuman> There's an SSL module? I just use the sasl module to auth to libera
[21:28:27] <DarthGandalf> SSL != SASL
[21:28:33] <DarthGandalf> different things
[21:28:36] <Gnuman> but that message you pasted looks like you're trying to connect to a server on your private LAN (192.168.1.111), so I assumed you're struggling with getting weechat to connect to ZNC
[21:28:51] <Gnuman> yeah, what Darth said
[21:31:25] <sokan> I have a config (based on /fest on weechat) where I connect to 192.168.1.111/20000 under the username azncuser/rizon
[21:31:41] <sokan> When I try to connect to it, it gives me the message I sent before

[21:39:14] <DarthGandalf> ...of course
[21:39:20] <DarthGandalf> That's how software works

[21:51:16] <qwerty> wait maybe i need a non-tls port
[21:52:20] <MetaNova> that depends on if you bound the listening port to a specific IP (which would exclude localhost) as well as if whatever port you configured uses SSL or not

[21:56:19] <MetaNova> means that "addport +1234" is indicating 1234 should use SSL and "addport 1234" is a non-SSL port

[22:57:16] <sokan> To change the znc.conf I need to either do that from webgui or from within an irc client?
[22:58:11] <MetaNova> there are very few reasons to touch the conf besides interacting with the webadmin or *status/*controlpanel
[22:59:06] <sokan> I want to keep the same port but disable IPv4 and add a specific IP for Host

[23:00:21] <sokan> *status works when service runs right?
[23:01:09] <MetaNova> I don't understand the question

[23:02:10] <sokan> t
[23:02:43] <sokan> But to connect to znc from weechat I must have the znc service enabled. ....I think :S
[23:03:03] <MetaNova> in order to speak to *status you need to be able to connect your client to ZNC
[23:03:10] <MetaNova> in order for that to happen ZNC needs to be running

[23:10:05] <sokan> MetaNova: I'm terribly sorry for that. I just tried figuring it out on my own
[23:10:59] <MetaNova> so, what errors are shown?
[23:12:28] <sokan> So startnig afresh: I installed znc. I use portage (system) znc user and run sudo -u znc --makeconfig, so my config file is located in /var/lib/znc/.znc.
[23:13:00] <sokan>  /usr/bin/znc works just fine and I can run znc (using only webgui on client currently).

[23:13:27] <sokan> and this here is the issue
[23:14:15] <MetaNova> was ZNC running (from manually executing /usr/bin/znc) at the time?
[23:15:06] <sokan> MetaNova: I don't recall. Should I kill znc via PID now and try running the service again?
[23:15:30] <MetaNova> yes. if ZNC can't bind to a port or the conf is already in use, it will fail
[23:16:29] <sokan> MetaNova: exact same response
[23:16:41] <sokan> Want to take a look at the service file?
[23:17:06] <MetaNova> next steps would be to see the contents of the unit file as well as znc.conf yes
[23:20:24] <sokan> MetaNova: can I PM them?
[23:20:30] <MetaNova> sure
[23:20:46] <sokan> they are both included in the same paste

[23:25:59] <MetaNova> other than ZNC_DATADIR seems undefined
[23:28:00] <MetaNova> must be pulling it from the environment or such

[23:30:29] <sokan>  /usr/bin/znc always runs just fine
[23:30:45] <sokan>  /etc/init.d/znc has the issues
[23:31:47] <MetaNova> look, the primary benefit of having ZNC managed as a service is to make sure it launches when the system starts
[23:32:09] <MetaNova> to me it seems like the gentoo service file is broken somehow
[23:32:26] <MetaNova> if you can make ZNC function the way you want by simply executing /usr/bin/znc then just do that
[23:32:37] <sokan> MetaNova: will do :)
[23:32:39] <sokan> thanks
[23:35:43] <MetaNova> (and if you really wanted to, consider filing a bug/issue with the gentoo people, including the displayed error(s), the contents of the unit file and the conf file, as well as output from ls -l (to show mode and ownership) of /var/lib/znc /var/lib/znc/.znc /var/lib/znc/.znc/configs/znc.conf and um
[23:35:53] <MetaNova> .. I think that's it)
[23:51:57] <sokan> Is there any chance that the fact that znc.conf is in /var/lib/znc/.znc might be causing issues?
[23:55:50] <MetaNova> only if the service file does not adequately tell ZNC that it is there
[23:57:03] <MetaNova> it's standard practice for the "convenient" packagers to make a system user "znc" and make the datadir /var/lib/znc/.znc
[23:59:08] <sokan> Can I run /etc/init.d/znc --datadit=/var/lib/znc/.znc?
[23:59:29] <MetaNova> I don't think the service file accepts arguments
[23:59:42] <MetaNova> you can try if you like
