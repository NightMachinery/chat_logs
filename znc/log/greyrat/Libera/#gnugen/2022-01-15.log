[01:28:48] <Orbstheorem> I got my salt box replaced...
[01:28:49] <Orbstheorem> The nice part: 1-day shipping...
[01:28:49] <Orbstheorem> The less nice part, I had to reconfigure it.
[01:28:49] <Orbstheorem> The ugly part: They decomisioned the old connection at 15h...
[01:28:49] <Orbstheorem> And only now am I getting the SMS from my monitoring: "Hey, there's no internet connection!"

[01:33:10] <Orbstheorem> This is a very fun graph.
[01:40:05] <Orbstheorem> Wow, l'interface Github est tellement pas claire sur ce qu'elle fait quand tu appuies sur "rebase and merge"...

[01:40:32] <Orbstheorem> Me: The branch is up to date, why would you rebase?... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/e271a965f44415c531739a6fcc7ac3c8740a25cf)
[01:40:45] <Orbstheorem> And of course it rewrote the commit!
[01:40:54] <Orbstheorem> Why? No reason :D

[10:14:46] <Notkea> yeah, the github interface isn't very good at all. I usually just do the merge from the command line and then let GitHub detect it and close the matching pull request automatically
[11:41:23] <afontain[m]> oh, I didn't know you could do that
[11:41:45] <afontain[m]> does it also detect if you rebase before merging?
[11:48:29] <Notkea> I don't think so. I only saw it detect fast-forward merges and merge commits otherwise. I think it's nevertheless still possible to close the pull request through a rebased commit by editing the commit message to include a closing command that GitHub can understand
[12:28:02] <Orbstheorem> Where do github understand commands?
[12:28:14] <Orbstheorem> I've tried over email replies or comments and nada.

[13:33:48] <Orbstheorem> Well, I don't really used this, I should put it away...
[13:33:58] <Orbstheorem> starts playing with it
[13:34:09] <Orbstheorem> *playing intensifies... *
[13:34:28] <Orbstheorem> Meh, this is too much fun to put away xD
[13:34:32] <Notkea> looks like procrastinating tbh
[13:35:20] <Orbstheorem> Partly, I really need my room to be clean if I'm gonna lock myself in here for the next two weeks...
[13:35:30] <Orbstheorem> But yes...
[13:35:57] <Notkea> my place tends to get tidy a couples of days and weeks before exams :)
[14:14:48] <sparrowhawk[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Partly, I really need my room to..." <- Why would you do that ?
[14:39:17] <Orbstheorem> I have a hard exam next week and two semester projects due to 11 days.
