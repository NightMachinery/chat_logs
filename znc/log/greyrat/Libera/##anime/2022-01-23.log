[00:41:19] <emmeka> Bco1981 Funimation and Crunchyroll were the major competitors of the industry. But recently Sony. which owns Funimation, bought out Crunchyroll. And announced it intends to merge them.
[00:41:35] <emmeka> so there's been some weirdness in the interrim
[00:41:50] <emmeka> like mirrored releases on both platforms, or shifting content between platforms
[00:41:58] <Satin> any opinions on this situation? https://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/2022/01/21/what-we-know-ascension-thedacare-court-battle-over-employees/6607417001/
[00:41:58] <ImoutoBot> [title] What we know the Ascension, ThedaCare court battle over employees
[00:42:53] <Satin> Me and some other folks I've been talking to about it are in agreement it's absolutely wrong for ThedaCare to be trying to control their employees and not let them work for Ascension instead of paying them better
[00:43:19] <emmeka> I'm confused what the legal justification for it is
[00:43:26] <Satin> but what we're not in agreement is if the judge did the wrong thing with the temp ruling till monday, for me it *sounds like* usual court proceedings
[00:43:30] <emmeka> at-will state, so, fuck them?
[00:43:34] <Satin> but friend goes
[00:43:46] <Satin> "This judge is basically saying it is illegal to withdraw your labor without permission.
[00:43:46] <Satin> Even temporarily""
[00:43:50] <emmeka> but no, at-will employment only matters when it's a principle that benefits the employer, clearly
[00:43:51] <Satin> I'm not convinced of that.
[00:44:16] <emmeka> Satin I'm confused about the logic, because the law says literally the exact opposite of that.
[00:44:20] <Bco1981> "illegal to withdraw your labor without permission"... ehm boss... is it okay that i die ?
[00:44:58] <Satin> So we're basically not in agreement/unsure of the judge's actions in this case. The judge told both companies, hash out an agreement to handle this or else nobody goes to work till Monday's full hearing. 
[00:44:58] <emmeka> states with at-will employment laws explicitly allow employees and employers to terminate employment without notice at any time for any reason
[00:45:14] <Satin> and the folks i'm talking to say THAT is wrong
[00:45:20] <Urchin[emacs]> wasn't there a case recently when a pharmacy had a woman work through a heart attack until she died?
[00:45:36] <snake> Bco1981, are there naked boobs?
[00:45:39] <Satin> (i realize that these are hourly workers and their ability to make living wages is being impacted, but outside of that, is the judge really being unethical here?)
[00:45:46] <emmeka> Satin yeah but this is clearly against the law
[00:45:53] <Bco1981> snake: idk, haven't watched it yet.
[00:45:55] <emmeka> if I was the employees, I would sue the state.

Historically, Bitcoin bubbles have always ended below that range, but this "bubble"'s top doesn't look anything like the previous bubbles. It almost looks like just a setup for a future bubble. But anyway, if you're looking for a buying opportunity, the $17792 - $28737 range is probably a good price range to buy for the long term (as in, like 4+ years)

[04:08:24] <emmeka> MootPoot:
[04:08:52] <MootPoot> emmeka , using the new optical cable the audio quality is the same, there was no noticable hissing or anything to begin with so the only real improvement is that volume control is smoother since I only have to deal with 2 volumes rather then 3 
[04:09:37] <emmeka> well, it's still for the best.
[04:09:54] <MootPoot> its easier to achieve the perfect volume zone - rather then too loud or too quiet
[04:10:15] <emmeka> a cool thing about it is that optical is passive like analog, there's not HDCP syncing or anything, which is nice.
[04:10:30] <MootPoot> I dont really use HDCP afaik
[04:10:37] <MootPoot> 99% of my time is using non HDCP stuff
[04:11:00] <MootPoot> its only for amazon prime video or neetflix on the fire stick where I actually use it
[04:11:51] <emmeka> doesn't actually matter. HDMI still does HDCP syncing anyway
[04:11:59] <MootPoot> I dont use HDMI tho
[04:12:03] <MootPoot> DP
[04:12:06] <emmeka> DP too
[04:12:10] <MootPoot> hrm
[04:12:31] * MootPoot shrugs
[04:12:49] <emmeka> it's not a big deal but can produce annoyances in certain cases
[04:14:21] <MootPoot> well, it was only 6 bucks so - eh
[04:15:13] <MootPoot> wonder what's actually in it
[04:15:25] <MootPoot> transparent plastic as the 'fiber'
[04:15:32] <MootPoot> or bendy glass idk
[04:16:20] <emmeka> usually the expensive ones are glass and the cheap ones are plastic but it really makes absolutely no difference unless you're talking very long cable runs
[04:16:32] <emmeka> the most lol thing I seen was gold plated toslink cable connections
[04:16:57] <emmeka> like, it has no ground. the connection serves no purpose but to hold it in place. if anything, plastic is better, because it snaps in well
[04:17:16] <MootPoot> I think this one is just like 2m long 
[04:17:52] <emmeka> it's a digital connection, it either works or it doesn't, the quality of the cable won't improve audio quality
[04:18:28] <MootPoot> afaik that is a commonly repeated thing that works in most cases, but it is false
[04:19:16] <emmeka> it's true though. the only thing the quality of cable will improve is if it works or doesn't.
[04:19:38] <MootPoot> something along the lines of the signal is a signal, but a shit cable can result in the signals not being delivered in order
[04:19:42] <emmeka> but it is true that in many scenarios you would want quality cables, because otherwise you'll be on the side of "doesn't"
[04:19:43] <MootPoot> or on time
[04:19:54] <emmeka> yeah but digital connections just retry or fail
[04:19:59] <emmeka> and if they fail, it is noticeable
[04:20:09] <MootPoot> yeah, I had that with my DP cable
[04:20:17] <MootPoot> the fail -> screen went black as it lost sync
[04:20:32] <MootPoot> picked up a better cable that was quite a bit thicker
[04:20:34] <MootPoot> problemo gone
[04:21:01] <MootPoot> and afaik lots of cheapo chinese makers dont actually fully comply to the spec

[04:24:18] <MootPoot> it gets worse the higher hz and resolutions you push as well
[04:29:19] <emmeka> I know with toslink and long cable runs you want glass because on long runs you can get jitter, from the light bouncing within the cable ever so slightly and ruining the clock rate of the signal so DAC is slightly off
[04:29:48] <emmeka> but for short cables it isn't important, and if it is a problem, it will be instantly noticeable as analog-sounding noise
[04:29:53] <emmeka> or artifacting

[04:30:35] <emmeka> but I'm not sure how much of that is just audiophile mythology
[04:32:14] <MootPoot> so now its just - IF your cable fully complies to the spec - digital is just digital , its all the same. But a lot of cables dont
[04:32:40] <MootPoot> and they might still work, just not at the original spec rating
[04:37:42] <MootPoot> so the shitty DP cable that was failing me at 4k 144hz with 10 bit color / HDR on still works fine if I crank it down to 4k 95hz or something, or go use it on a 1440p 144hz display  - just need a good cable for the higher hz/res stuff
[04:38:15] <emmeka> I mean, thinking about it, it's light. you have digital audio at frequencies of at 48khz or whatever. the lowest frequencies of visible light are... 420 THz, looking it up. Which is uhhhhhh... 420 billion Khz.
[04:38:41] <emmeka> I feel like any slight bouncing within the cable shouldn't even matter
[04:39:02] <MootPoot> idk about your optical cables
[04:39:15] <MootPoot> just that for hdmi, USB, DP etc it can matter
[04:39:50] <emmeka> yeah there is absolutely a point at which a digital cable isn't good enough, because it just "won't work"
[04:40:12] <emmeka> but I remain unconvinced that there's significant benefits beyond that. idk how seriously to take the idea of jitter.
[04:40:22] <MootPoot> no, there is a grey zone between that though
[04:40:28] <emmeka> I know a lot of it is nonsense... like having gold plated toslink cables
[04:40:46] <MootPoot> you can have a digital cable which works 80% of the time then loses sync
[04:40:56] <MootPoot> its not 0% or 100% working
[04:40:57] <emmeka> well yes I would classify that under "won't work"
[04:41:04] <MootPoot> eh, that works
[04:41:09] <emmeka> if it can't hold sync it's not functional
[04:42:14] <emmeka> MootPoot consider though that the issue might not be cables being off-spec always, often it is devices. I had a weird thing where the one laptop my wife had, had an HDMI out, that output 59.99hz.
[04:42:26] <MootPoot> I was losing sync for maybe a second a every 5 min or so
[04:42:45] <MootPoot> emmeka:  some devices are like that - its a reporting thing
[04:42:54] <emmeka> some displays could handle the slightly off-spec signal, others couldn't
[04:43:05] <S_T_A_N> !quoter
[04:43:08] <S_T_A_N> !quote
[04:43:08] <emmeka> interestingly my TV could, but my monitor couldn't, which you'd expect the opposite
[04:43:08] <ImoutoBot> S_T_A_N: (24 / 32) <S​_T_A_N> imagine being that quoteable
[04:43:12] <MootPoot> I've had 59, 60 and 61hz displays
[04:43:16] <MootPoot> with and without random decimals
[04:43:21] <MootPoot> 59.73 hz on one
[04:43:59] <emmeka> the display isn't what's important there, though, the display should ideally be very close to 60hz...
[04:44:15] <emmeka> but I mean the device itself was outputting a 59.99hz signal over HDMI
[04:44:42] <emmeka> off-spec, causing various screens not to accept it, but some could.
[04:44:56] <emmeka> really weird. but true!
[04:51:20] <Matt|home>  ... is it really hard to ask yuri authors to stop portraying every male character in the work as some kind of rapist monster.. like.. except for straight up slapstick comedies i can't think of one i read in recent memory where there's one good guy who isn't either a complete simp or a non character
[04:51:24] <ButterNoodle> no 69hz?
[04:52:06] <MootPoot> Matt|home: that's what the market wants - its like ugly bastards

[04:58:29] <emmeka> I mean really it's yuri who wants boys involved at all, but when they are it's not only as rapists
[04:59:06] <MootPoot> I heard there is a sizable chunk of the yuri base who wants shows where men dont exist - even as an idea

[05:00:29] <MootPoot> not sure why its a big deal either way tho
[05:01:11] <emmeka> boys shouldn't be in yuri series. they should be in BL series. what degeneracy is this, expecting them to mix

[05:02:07] <MootPoot> are there BL series with the tag 404 women not found?

[06:22:52] <MootPoot> Sadale: I've been trying to get used to using only the keybaord for all my navigation
[06:22:54] <MootPoot> its hard but 
[06:23:00] <MootPoot> I'm slowly doing it
[06:23:09] <Sadale> Of course it'd be hard. Especially if you've got the GUI
[06:23:15] <Sadale> If it's CLI tho it should be possible.
[06:23:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, But why tho? Aren't you a Windows kid?
[06:23:35] <MootPoot> I taped a printed thing of all the shortcuts for all my different programs on the wall behind my monitor
[06:23:36] <Sadale> oh. That's Bco.
[06:23:37] <MootPoot> Sadale: ?
[06:23:44] <MootPoot> I do use winodws 10 as my main
[06:23:45] <Sadale> I mixed up you and someone lese
[06:23:53] <Sadale> lol
[06:24:04] <MootPoot> but its not really a windows vs linux question
[06:24:06] <Sadale> I wouldn't bother learning all those GUI shortcuts
[06:24:07] <MootPoot> keyboard only IS faster
[06:24:08] <MootPoot> if you can do that
[06:24:24] <Sadale> I mean you need to use mouse most of the time anyway
[06:24:30] <MootPoot> no, not really
[06:24:41] <MootPoot> if you know enough shortcuts
[06:25:10] <MootPoot> aside from closing windows or relocating it , you can do most everything else with KB only if you know all the shortcuts
[06:25:16] <MootPoot> and its faster - less missed clicks
[06:25:50] * MootPoot is kind of regertting using a full keyboard instead of a TKL that makes a mouse a little akward to use
[06:25:59] <Sadale> Closing Windows could be done by Alt+F4 or Ctrl+W
[06:26:00] <MootPoot> but I have it now, only choice is to use it and get used to it
[06:26:13] <MootPoot> Sadale: lol closing is different from terminating
[06:27:35] <MootPoot> I was thinking of making a utility program for switching windows though
[06:28:03] <MootPoot> although the main thing is just not having to use a mouse for browsing and reading documents or writing stuff in VScode
[06:29:40] <Sadale> hmm. Something's wrong with my balls. On the left one there's nothing right. And on the right one there's nothing left.
[06:29:50] <MootPoot> lolwut

[06:38:21] <ButterNoodle> would have no problem w a human torso
[06:38:55] <ButterNoodle> dood that sold me the saw wanted me to get all this safety shit
[06:39:14] <ButterNoodle> here I was in flip flops running a log splitter at 10

[07:28:30] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot 
[07:29:07] <MootPoot> Sadale: tbh laptop prices havent really gone crazy too much
[07:29:23] <MootPoot> they have increased by like 10-15% but compared to desktop GPUs thats nothing
[07:29:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, hmm true. Laptop GPU ain't meant for mining. And it's rather inefficient to mine with laptop GPU
[07:29:40] <MootPoot> there are poeple that do it
[07:29:49] <Sadale> As if mining with full-ledge GPU is efficient enough.
[07:30:06] <MootPoot> but laptop gpus tend to be like 20-30% slower then their desktop versions

[07:33:50] <Sadale> depending on the game tho
[07:34:15] <Sadale> To me the 2400G iGPU is good enough. I don't do heavy gaming as of today. :3 However, things may change after I retire

[07:36:14] <jbwncster> Do not use an intel gpu

[07:43:51] <MootPoot> depends on what you're doing
[07:44:07] <MootPoot> if you have like 3-4 browser windows open, and one of them is playing 4k video
[07:44:13] <MootPoot> I've had igpus cause lag
[07:44:22] <MootPoot> or if you're driving a triple monitor setup
[07:44:29] <MootPoot> poor things can barely keep up
[07:48:19] <mixfix41> get an open source headset beforehand
[07:48:38] <MootPoot> does one even exist
[07:48:46] <mixfix41> yea beta one
[07:48:52] <MootPoot> and I dont think any iGPU can handle a vr headset
[07:48:56] <MootPoot> at any usable resolution
[07:48:56] <mixfix41> its not for gaming
[07:49:20] <mixfix41> stiil would weigh one in since the possibilties..
[07:49:21] <MootPoot> you'd basically have to render the entire desktop 2x and then some 
[07:49:35] <MootPoot> no way a iGPU could even start to run that
[07:50:51] <Sadale> As if I've got a 4K screen
[07:50:57] <MootPoot> lol
[07:51:03] <Sadale> And as if I've got multiple screens :P
[07:51:03] * MootPoot is using triple 4k
[07:51:15] <MootPoot> you're missing out
[07:51:22] <Sadale> I mean why the heck would you want to have multiple browser windows open while playing 4K vid on one of them?
[07:51:44] <MootPoot> watching a podcase on one, then you have the other as what you're actually doing, and another for reference?
[07:51:53] <MootPoot> and another for chats like IRCloud
[07:51:55] <Sadale> nah I'm good with 1080p. The shit's small enough when playing older games. With 4K the old game would appear as even smaller.
[07:52:06] <MootPoot> you can just scale it with the proper settings
[07:52:11] <MootPoot> but anyway
[07:52:16] <Sadale> true.
[07:52:17] <MootPoot> I have a new contraption idea
[07:52:19] <Sadale> Not easy with linux
[07:52:30] <MootPoot> usb light that is like those studio lights
[07:52:36] <dfch> LOL scaling is ez
[07:52:38] <MootPoot> flashes red when you are using your mic
[07:52:44] <Sadale> dfch, really? :o
[07:52:48] <MootPoot> so you never forget that you're connected on discord or sometihng
[07:52:52] <MootPoot> since you can just check the light
[07:53:01] <Sadale> dfch, How do I scale without compromising the displayed quality?
[07:53:10] <MootPoot> wym
[07:53:15] <Sadale> I'm talking about those very old games like lincity
[07:53:18] <MootPoot> scale, not magnify
[07:54:05] <Sadale> Still I'm actually not so sure on if those tasks are GPU-bound. I find this idea... funny.
[07:54:14] <MootPoot> ?
[07:54:21] <MootPoot> you just render it at a higher resolution
[07:54:24] <MootPoot> and then scale the elements
[07:54:25] <MootPoot> thats it
[07:54:56] <Sadale> nah some older games and programs doesn't support rendering at higher resolution.
[07:55:09] <Sadale> "Still I'm actually not so sure on if those tasks are GPU-bound. I find this idea... funny" <- As for this one I'm talking about discord and browser and shit
[07:55:36] <dfch> xrandr <output> --scale 0.50x0.50 --filter nearest ?
[07:55:39] <MootPoot> all of those things literally have a setting for "use hardware acceleration" which is turned on by default

[07:56:26] <dfch> meh?
[07:56:38] <Sadale> dfch, There's a problem with that. I've got one monitor only and this would scale my entire desktop. 
[07:57:03] <Sadale> Anyway it'd work if I just want to reduce a 4K screen into a 1080p one.
[07:57:31] <Sadale> But hey! If that's what I'm doing what's even the point of having a 4K screen?
[07:57:43] <Sadale> Conclusion: 1080p FTW xD
[07:57:47] <dfch> Sadale, download the script
[07:58:04] <Sadale> dfch, I actually have written similar scripts in the past.
[07:58:20] <dfch> Sadale, it's per-app not entire desktop
[07:58:20] <MootPoot> I mean....
[07:58:23] * MootPoot hits Sadale 
[07:58:24] <MootPoot> baka
[07:58:50] <Sadale> dfch, Back then I only had a 1366x768 screen. When I wanted to display 1080p content, I'd use xrandr to scale the screen resolution to 1080p by software. Yes, it looks blurry. But it works.
[07:58:51] <MootPoot> just because you need to scale for that ONE old game you play dosen't mean you need to leave your desktop like that even if it was whole desktop scaling
[07:58:53] <Nanobot> MootPoot: Why does the pizza place that's three blocks from my house take 2 hours to deliver to me?
[07:59:11] <MootPoot> sometimes I play  games at 1440p instead of 4k ... dosen't mean I leave my screen on 1440p
[07:59:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, If I'm using dfch's solution on linux, I'd have to scale the entire desktop
[07:59:26] <MootPoot> yeah, just turn it off when you're done
[07:59:28] <MootPoot> :3
[07:59:30] <Nanobot> amigojapan: I haven't watched it yet. I'll watch it later. Currently watching Noel play Zelda 64 for the first time.

[07:59:41] <emmeka> Nanobot why do you get delivery if it's only 3 blocks away?
[07:59:49] <Sadale> MootPoot, ok. That settles it. I'll be sticking with 1080p :P
[07:59:56] <Nanobot> emmeka: Two reasons. Covid and laziness.

[08:01:35] <dfch> its basically xpra frontend
[08:01:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, ah. I see what dfch does. The script just create a virtual display or something and launch the program inside the virtual display, then forward the display to the main display inside a window
[08:01:44] <Sadale> dfch, Just opened it

[08:06:46] <MootPoot> I was just wondering if there is a way to make it so that randr will automatically default to that configuration
[08:06:56] <MootPoot> no matter what
[08:07:29] <Sadale> Of course there is. But you'll have to figure that out on your own because I don't have a dedi GPU. :P

[08:22:19] <Sadale> Under the current propossal, p2p trading would still be allowed tho.
[08:23:58] <MootPoot> Sadale: I dont undertand
[08:24:04] <MootPoot> understand* how is that a issue?
[08:24:25] <Sadale> p2p BTC trading seems to be less common than trading via an exchange.
[08:24:38] <MootPoot> sure, they can ban it , but its like blocking a website
[08:24:49] <Sadale> oh no.
[08:25:08] <MootPoot> get a virtual debit card online , money into that -> buy BTC?
[08:25:25] <MootPoot> and when you leave HK like you plan to just take it out there
[08:25:27] <Sadale> Almost all major cryptoexchange try to comply with local laws.
[08:25:45] <MootPoot> buy it from a non HK exchange?
[08:26:10] <Sadale> Buying isn't a problem. Selling is
[08:26:31] <Sadale> I could just use whatever credit card to buy BTC. But selling them is far more difficult to me without a proper exchange.
[08:26:38] <MootPoot> yeah, sell it and keep it as credit to your account with the btc in it
[08:26:49] <MootPoot> like with coinbase, you can just leave your money in there in the form of USD
[08:26:56] <MootPoot> you dont have to take it out
[08:27:00] <Sadale> pfffffft
[08:27:21] * MootPoot shrugs
[08:27:21] <Sadale> That's how you make all the money that you can't spend xD
[08:27:32] <MootPoot> you're saving for retirement though
[08:27:33] <Sadale> a.k.a. I'd be losing money! xD
[08:27:37] <MootPoot> I still dont see the problem
[08:27:42] <redempt1on> This Dex have me like an e-tard, all jaw grindin n shit... like I'm Jim Carey on crack
[08:27:43] <MootPoot> when you leave HK take it out then
[08:27:59] <Sadale> true. If I'm holding BTC I could take it out outside HK.
[08:28:01] <Nanobot> China announces the end of the One China principle. The decision was made in order to combat the declining number of Chinas, and the disproportionately high number of old and male Chinas. China owner Xi Kingpin expressed his hope that this will allow more nations to become China and lead to a brighter economic future.
[08:28:11] <MootPoot> quick trip to a different country, get your money in that country
[08:28:15] <MootPoot> come back
[08:28:23] <Sadale> That works too
[08:28:31] <Sadale> lol money laundary xD
[08:28:37] <MootPoot> not really laundering
[08:28:46] <MootPoot> you're just going through a loophole
[08:28:47] <Sadale> Make sure to take cash. cash. cash!! It isn't tracible this way xD
[08:29:04] <MootPoot> if you plan to move to PH just make an account with a bank in PH
[08:29:10] <Sadale> Or create an oversea bank account.
[08:29:10] <MootPoot> and take it out to that account
[08:29:13] <Nanobot> Cash is hard to trace because it's so flat. You end up accidentally writing on the bill itself.

[08:37:34] <Sadale> Actually I do agree that using workspace's less efficient than having multiple monitors.

[10:58:01] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: remake but not as bad as crystal
[10:58:39] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: it is based on the sailor moon Super S
[10:59:09] <ButterNoodle> S_T_A_N: watching akebi-chan.. and gonna touch myself inappropriately
[10:59:41] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle: understandable

[11:02:23] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: pls read darlin wa namamono ni tsuki after
[11:02:23] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: I don't like fillers.
[11:02:38] <HubertFarnsworth> Some of the worst fillers were in Bleach and Naruto.
[11:02:45] <HubertFarnsworth> there was an episode in bleach just in bathtub
[11:02:58] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: some how this one feels like it is going too fast
[11:02:58] <ButterNoodle> HubertFarnsworth: is it good?
[11:03:08] <HubertFarnsworth> time ticks away faster than you expect amigojapan 
[11:03:33] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: probably cause it is a movie

[13:19:33] <jbwncster> There’s one of those in Tokyo
[13:19:37] <MootPoot> lesson learned - never go to themed resturants
[13:19:45] <Sadale> I mean whey said so right in their name
[13:19:46] <MootPoot> they attract you with the theme not hte food
[13:19:59] <MootPoot> Sadale: for some reason the mushroom soup was REALLY good but everything else was terrible
[13:20:03] <jbwncster> The sailor moon themed cafe looked good on YouTube
[13:20:05] <MootPoot> like worse then kombini food
[13:20:20] <MootPoot> or actually, worse then my first attempt style of cooking
[13:20:24] <Sadale> lol!
[13:20:26] <jbwncster> Why don’t we have themed places in usa?
[13:20:31] <MootPoot> and I spent like 30 dollars there
[13:20:35] <MootPoot> regret
[13:20:40] <Sadale> lol that's expensive
[13:20:46] <MootPoot> 30 dollars for 2 people
[13:20:50] <Sadale> like very expensive there.
[13:20:53] <Sadale> oh. That's better.
[13:20:54] <MootPoot> 30 dollars of regret
[13:20:56] <amigojapan> jbwncster: I have gone to a  steins gate themed cafe
[13:21:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, With whom? Your girlfriend?
[13:21:07] <jbwncster> MootPoot: street food is cheaper
[13:21:14] <Sadale> or your mom? :P

[13:21:20] <MootPoot> Sadale: with u
[13:21:31] <jbwncster> amigojapan: there’s a donut shop in Tokyo that sells Pokémon themed donuts
[13:21:45] <MootPoot> Sadale: it was a hipster pizza place where this girl with MASSIVE honkers was making the pizza in a hot af dining area
[13:21:52] <MootPoot> she was sweating like crazy
[13:21:57] <MootPoot> it was nice eye candy
[13:22:00] <amigojapan> That's not surprising jbwncster 
[13:22:02] <MootPoot> pretty sure she sweat on my pizza
[13:22:06] <MootPoot> was 10/10 pizza

[13:22:27] <amigojapan> jbwncster: yeah they are fun, but expensive
[13:22:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, what's a honker?
[13:22:44] <MootPoot> slang for boobies
[13:22:47] <Sadale> oh lol
[13:22:56] <jbwncster> Also there was a cafe in Tokyo where the wait staff was rude to you on purpose
[13:23:06] <MootPoot> huge honky wonky badoinkadoinks
[13:23:10] <MootPoot> uwu
[13:23:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, now that I'm wondering if that's intentional. The boobs

[13:30:53] <Sadale> If wet dreams are allowed, I think I'd do that as well. It's a fucking million of dollar!
[13:31:06] <amigojapan> There is no such thing as an "incel

[13:32:20] <Sadale> If you move to PH tho you may not have to work anymore with 1mil
[13:32:30] <Sadale> You'd have to take the risk of the index fund tho
[13:32:40] <amigojapan> Jesse I'm front

[13:33:16] <jbwncster> MootPoot: Bitcoin
[13:33:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, If yoiu buy it and the index fund dropped, it could take years until the index get back to whereever it was again
[13:33:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh I'm talking about stop working right away after getting the 1mil
[13:33:51] <MootPoot> true, but if the fund dropped then that means you have MUCH bigger social problems

[13:34:10] <Sadale> MootPoot, not necessarily.
[13:34:16] <jbwncster> amigojapan: not always
[13:34:21] <MootPoot> if a index fund drops enough to matter that basically means you have had a economic collapse

[13:48:11] <MootPoot> uhh
[13:48:23] <MootPoot> not sure how to do that in this format of table
[13:48:38] <PancakeMatsuri> I use Google Sheets

[13:49:18] <MootPoot> its really good - my professor told me to check it out
[13:49:22] <MootPoot> then I moved everything onto there
[13:49:26] <MootPoot> projects, notes, etc
[13:49:43] <MootPoot> google keep / sheets is garbage in comparison 
[13:49:47] <PancakeMatsuri> I also wanted colored %
[13:50:00] <MootPoot> sheets can do some more advanced calulations but at that point I would just use excel
[13:50:27] <MootPoot> the problem with sheets is the low level of integration - like you cant embed a sheet in a mini window in a google keep note
[13:50:36] <MootPoot> but you can here like I'm doing
[13:51:25] <MootPoot> Good for project management, tracking, you can export or edit in markdown
[13:51:33] <MootPoot> It's the best, really

[14:20:31] <PancakeMatsuri> raw tofu? cooked tofu?
[14:20:32] <MootPoot> you just stir fry tofu, then put eggs

[14:51:00] <isekaijin> Will Visual Studio ever be not a bloated mess anymore?
[14:51:09] <MootPoot> define bloated
[14:51:18] <isekaijin> Everything changed for the worse in the 2000s, with the single exception of C++ standard compliance.
[14:51:31] <MootPoot> seems like bloated just means - It has extra stuff that I dont use personally
[14:51:44] <isekaijin> Visual Studio 6 was rather lightweight. not completely lightweight for its time, but nowhere as bloated as today.
[14:51:52] <MootPoot> again, define bloated
[14:52:22] <MootPoot> does bloated = resource heavy?
[14:52:28] <isekaijin> YES.
[14:52:37] <MootPoot> sure, if you have a craptop from like 2008
[14:52:44] <MootPoot> but any IDE will be painful to run on that
[14:52:52] <MootPoot> eclipse, netbeans, IDEA
[14:53:31] <MootPoot> I guess its bloated from the perspective of a person using a computer it was never really meant to accomodate very well

[14:54:17] <MootPoot> then it should run fine?
[14:54:45] <isekaijin> It doesn't? Or maybe you have low expectations regarding how fast programs are supposed to run.
[14:54:46] <MootPoot> compared to vim or VScode its going to use more resources without a doubt, but you shouldn't really have a problem
[14:55:26] <MootPoot> anything I ask it to do is instantanious - just as fast as doing it in atom or other things
[14:55:48] <isekaijin> Atom itself is super bloated.
[14:56:07] <MootPoot> from that perspective then sure - go use vim

[14:57:16] <MootPoot> cant be bothered to pay 200 bucks for it 
[14:58:16] <Catmuffin> Grateful that i'm still a student
[15:00:03] <isekaijin> Some features of IDEs are nice, like finding definitions and uses of variables. But even those are less reliable today than they were in the 90's, because today's programming languages are more dynamic and crazy.
[15:00:35] <isekaijin> Like, how is renaming all uses of a variable supposed to work, when reflection writes half your classes?
[15:04:30] <MootPoot> sounds like a design / language issue rather then anything to do with VS
[15:04:37] <isekaijin> Sure.
[15:05:12] <MootPoot> just wondering - do you have an example of a IDE you would not call bloated?
[15:06:34] <isekaijin> Visual C++ 6. But its compliance with the C++ standard leaves a lot to be desired. You can't even initialize a variable in a for loop like “for (std::vector<int>::iterator_type it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); it++)”.

[15:30:16] <MootPoot> Sadale: I wonder if you can make a microcontroller send / recieve data over optical
[15:30:19] <MootPoot> easily
[15:30:28] <MootPoot> it would reduce the number of cables by a lot
[15:30:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, Not so sure. I suppose that it depends on the rate.
[15:30:55] <Sadale> If it's slow, you could just beam UART messages into the optical cable.
[15:30:59] <MootPoot> just use a off the shelf toslink cable - then have some kind of chip that takes in a bunch of digital inputs and passes them through
[15:31:35] <Sadale> I'm actually worried about using optical cable. Not sure on how modern optical cables are like. But AFAIK optical fiber cable are dangerous when broken.
[15:31:36] <mixfix41> no it was only for the question in particular and what came to my mind nothing about you 
[15:31:54] <MootPoot> seems like you can get a optical UART shield for a duino
[15:32:25] <Sadale> AFAIK optical fiber are made of glass or something. If the cable broke, those tiny glass can cause real damage to body
[15:33:01] <mixfix41> also i was getting through a stomach ache so trying to not think about it as well
[15:33:47] <MootPoot> It would be cool though
[15:34:02] <MootPoot> wiring a seperate fiber cable for everything is annoyingh
[15:34:05] <MootPoot> copper*
[15:34:15] <MootPoot> having just a single cable would be so much ncier
[15:36:00] <Sadale> I've no idea on what kind of transeiver you'd use for beaming shit into the optical fiber tho.
[15:36:11] <Sadale> probably some kind of laser transmit+receiver.

[15:50:11] <Sadale> huh? If it's over UART, the bandwidth would be very very low
[15:50:48] <Sadale> We're looking at up to 3Mbps. And the normal UART rate is like 115.2kbps, which's 92.16kbps after encoding/decoding overhead.

[15:52:39] <Sadale> I have a hunch that it's just a physical optical cable connection. That's it. So if it's UART, then the raw UART message would get sent to the optical cable directly, which probably won't be compatible with any other optical cable protocol standard.

[17:31:00] <Catmuffin> emmeka, I see
[17:31:30] <emmeka> I *think* the CGA graphics card came out at the same time as the original IBM PC models? So there's probably not much of a delay there

[17:35:35] <Sadale> hopefully she won't get bored out
[17:35:39] <emmeka> before that all PCs had just had completely incompatible operating systems, MS-DOS let you carry everything forward, and the hardware was also upgradeable in ways we expect PCs to be now

[17:43:52] <emmeka> it's actually hard to find what the first CGA game was. It seems a lot of them were ported over from the Apple II around the time of CGA's release, to coincide with it.

[17:47:55] <emmeka> Catmuffin actually it seems like Microsoft Adventure and this pre-included game were released on the exact same day. So I guess since it's included in the OS, it's more first than Microsoft Adventure
[17:48:23] <Bco1981> Catmuffin: you get the gzdoom engine, then a original doom.wad, then you load the wolf3d resources with the gzdoom engine.
[17:48:49] <amigojapan> emmeka: the IBM PC was not meant as a games computer and it showed for a long time
[17:48:59] <emmeka> CGA graphics were the worst thing ever
[17:49:08] <emmeka> that colour scheme
[17:49:12] <emmeka> like, why
[17:49:27] <amigojapan> emmeka: how about Hercules graphics?
[17:49:34] <Catmuffin> emmeka, feels more modern than I imagined
[17:50:09] <amigojapan> emmeka: the colour scheme was meant to give 16 colours on composite video
[17:50:20] <Catmuffin> I can't wait for my friend to ask me what is the first pc game
[17:50:29] <Sadale> emmeka, The color scheme looks worse than monochrome
[17:51:06] <emmeka> amigojapan CGA had 4 colours when used at "high" resolution, which all games did pretty much. Wanna know what the 4 colours were.
[17:51:17] <emmeka> magenta, cyan, white and black.
[17:51:50] <emmeka> it's like being eye-fucked by the early 80s
[17:52:02] <amigojapan> emmeka: those are basic colours that your can mix to make other colours
[17:52:07] <emmeka> no
[17:52:28] <amigojapan> emmeka: I have seen it running
[17:52:30] <emmeka> CGA used 4 colour graphics for games. It had those 4, and an option for intensity as RGBI, and nothing else.
[17:52:31] <Sadale> Why not using red, green, blue, white instead? or red, green, blue, black
[17:52:36] <emmeka> Sadale why indeed.
[17:52:50] <Sadale> emmeka, or even, black, light grey, dark grey and black.
[17:53:01] <emmeka> amigojapan you're right that it was designed for composite, and so NTSC artifacting did improve the colour scheme a bit
[17:53:10] <amigojapan> emmeka: that's cause you did not play the special games on composite video
[17:53:14] <emmeka> because you could take advantage of artifacting to make colours seem better
[17:53:34] <amigojapan> Right
[17:53:51] <Catmuffin> Ah yeah it's the colors
[17:54:05] <emmeka> but the actual colours output were 8 (4 colours, 2 intensity values), not 16, and composite didn't change this except to fuzz pixels together by artifacting
[17:54:30] <emmeka> amigojapan there actually were CGA games with a 16 colour palette, but they used very low resolutions
[17:54:37] <Catmuffin> I always get the impression that all very old games, they use dark colors
[17:54:50] <amigojapan> I see emmeka 
[17:56:11] <amigojapan> emmeka: that was a trade off some games were willing to make
[17:57:21] <emmeka> checking, 160x100 graphics gave you 16 colours. Standard 320×200 gave you 4, and the highest resolution mode (640 x 200) gave you black and any 1 other CGA colour on the palette, but by default white.

[18:30:19] <cool-a-toss> i wanna watch steins;gatw
[18:30:27] <cool-a-toss> steins;gate*
[18:30:27] <Satin> steins;gate is decent
[18:30:40] <cool-a-toss> but the problem is i cant find matching subs and dubs
[18:31:01] <cool-a-toss> i want both in english
[18:31:19] <cool-a-toss> the dubs say one thing and subs say a different thing
[18:31:47] <cool-a-toss> i checked opensubtitles but couldnt find matching ones

[18:42:01] <cool-a-toss> oh
[18:43:06] <cool-a-toss> why tho
[18:44:07] <dfch> same question, dubs... why tho?
[18:44:48] <Vohveli> subs are typically made for the original Japanese audio, they're not transcripts of a dub
[18:44:51] <cool-a-toss> i cant understand japanese
[18:45:40] <cool-a-toss> i watch everything with subs bcoz 1. i am not a native english/japanese speaker and 2. i watch on low volume. my parents think i am studying
[18:45:45] <Sxem> i notice the japanese subs have more sexual references than the english dubs
[18:46:21] <Sxem> i guess they sanitize the dubs
[18:46:35] <Sxem> i like having both
[18:46:43] <Sxem> sometimes i learn stuff from the subs that is not in the dub
[18:47:09] <cool-a-toss> hmm, so you watch with different subs and dubs?
[18:47:31] <Sxem> its better explained in the subs and the dub kind of simplifies it
[18:47:42] <Sxem> yes
[18:48:13] <cool-a-toss> nice lol, but doesnt seem to work with me
[18:48:23] <cool-a-toss> but then again, this is supposed to be my first anime
[18:48:28] <cool-a-toss> so ig i gotta try
[18:48:34] <Sxem> it usually matches up like 90% but that 10% can be very informative
[18:49:29] <Sxem> like maybe a name will be in the subs and the dubs use a pronoun, and then i know exactly who theyre talking about but with the dub only i might be confused

[19:29:43] <dfch> nope

[19:31:56] <Sadale> I wonder if I'd see this kind of societal decline/collapse in my life time.
[19:32:30] <emmeka> in some countries, yeah
[19:33:07] <Sadale> I'd imagine major cities would be hit less badly tho. That's because we've got the money to deal with shit and buy shit.
[19:33:28] <emmeka> Sadale most countries can offset declining birth rates and thus population by immigration from countries where it is still above replacement
[19:33:47] <Urchin[emacs]> current research suggests that we're tracking limits to growth BAU2 or comprehensive technology scenario
[19:33:47] <emmeka> this is basically how the entire first world persists now, and how it will persist for like a century
[19:33:48] <Sadale> yes but what to do if the population of the entire earth is declining?
[19:34:16] <Urchin[emacs]> bau2 is collapse, CT is a temporary decline and then growth again
[19:35:02] <emmeka> Sadale but certain countries right now aren't open to immigrants in any substantial capacity enough to offset population decline, and they're already seeing the effects. Most noteably, Japan and South Korea, and in the years to come the PRC
[19:35:44] <emmeka> Japan is basically doomed as a nation, they're already seeing census declines and the boomers aren't even dead yet
[19:35:46] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], bau2 said that the population keeps growing? https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1626203862142-image3.png

[19:36:30] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: CT population keeps growing
[19:36:40] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], show pic please. Maybe my source is wrong
[19:36:43] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: you're looking at polution
[19:36:50] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], oh
[19:36:56] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: population is the blue one
[19:36:58] <Sadale> damn I need sleep xD
[19:37:06] <dfch> PRC is even more effed comparing to Japan/SK
[19:37:29] <emmeka> PRC just hasn't seen the effects yet
[19:37:33] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: right to repair may play a factor in distinguishing these two
[19:37:39] <emmeka> because it took longer to reach birth rate decline
[19:37:49] <emmeka> but it will, and also has the sex imbalance to fuck things up even more
[19:37:57] <dfch> ^
[19:38:05] <emmeka> not only are there not enough youth, there's not enough women
[19:38:05] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], wow. 2040s. That's the estimated top industrial output
[19:38:11] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], It's closer than I thought
[19:38:33] <Sadale> polygamy comes to rescue
[19:39:02] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: look at the yellow line (food)
[19:39:14] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], LOL
[19:39:21] <emmeka> Sadale polygamy doesn't solve birth rates per woman
[19:39:42] <Sadale> emmeka, true
[19:40:09] <emmeka> Sadale it'll just be a real shock to the world when things really get bad in Japan. In another 20-30 years, the population is going to fall of a cliff there
[19:40:12] <Sadale> I wonder if PRC could just make agreessive measurements to encourage people giving birth tho, like offering rewards for people who give birth to kids. IIRC singapore offers this kind of reward/subsidy as well.
[19:40:24] <emmeka> and what population is left will be increasingly elderly every year
[19:40:39] <emmeka> Sadale it doesn't work.
[19:40:42] <emmeka> we do this here.
[19:41:10] <emmeka> "baby bonus". all parents get it, though it's adjusted for income and pays the most when you have children under the age of 6
[19:41:23] <emmeka> but if you're low income it's thousands month
[19:41:46] <Sadale> emmeka, If baby bonus doesn't work, how about punishment of not having baby?
[19:41:51] <emmeka> lol
[19:41:57] <Sadale> So do both. Baby bonus plus no-baby punishment
[19:42:16] <emmeka> that sounds like a cruel trick to those who can't have children
[19:42:31] <dfch> and those who don't want to have
[19:42:33] <emmeka> or you know, it'd also be a tax on gayness
[19:42:40] <dfch> and children themselves of course
[19:43:06] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], damn. If the World3 BAU2 prediction is true, I may need to adjust my retirement plan.
[19:43:16] * emmeka shrugs
[19:43:24] <emmeka> I'll be up here, same as always, in the clay
[19:43:33] <dfch> I mean 1-child policy and similar shit kinda shows us that we shouldn't meddle in the ordinary folk bedroom
[19:44:10] <emmeka> the issue isn't really that humans have stopped wanting to reproduce, it's that our society makes this actually impossible for most of the population now
[19:44:18] <emmeka> fucked if any median worker can raise 3 kids
[19:44:27] <emmeka> and that's what we need right now, to keep populations afloat
[19:44:57] <dfch> well, yeah, this also
[19:45:14] <Sadale> true. It simply costs too much to give birth to a baby. Plus you need very many time and resources for raising a kid
[19:45:46] <emmeka> women who have kids are basically penalized in their careers and lifetime earnings, men don't earn incomes high enough to sustain families on their own, and society frowns upon any aberration from that gender arrangement anyway.
[19:45:48] <Sadale> The 9-5 work schedule with low pay simply doesn't work.
[19:46:09] <dfch> 996
[19:46:47] <emmeka> it's a broken system. we won't get anywhere until society changes to view parenting as a gender neutral job and generally supplies parents with the income they need to raise children, without any detriment to their professional lives for doing so
[19:46:47] <Sadale> People who don't have the money can't give birth because they don't have the time nor money to do so. Meanwhile, people who do have the money won't give birth or they'd have to compromise on their career :/
[19:47:25] <emmeka> p much
[19:49:11] <Sadale> I actually think that parenting by male is ok.
[19:49:17] <Sadale> I mean the father raising the children
