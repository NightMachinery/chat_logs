[00:00:12] <[Coke]> Anyone else having trouble with the 'uv.h' missing file bug?

[00:05:07] <[Coke]> (workaround: re-try the build?)
[00:07:07] <timo> that seems to be very new
[00:07:13] <timo> you can try an older moarvm commit

[00:43:46] <lizmat> [Coke]: I had the same...   I rebuilt all the intermediate commits, and it seemed to fix itself
[00:44:20] <lizmat> also, I dud a "git submodule update" somewhere along the way, but I doubt that had anything to do with it

[02:29:07] <m6locks> what should I pass as a null value if I have a method that expects an instance of a class but there's a certain case where a null would need to be passed? 
[02:29:18] <m6locks> getting an error expecting xxx but got Nil
[02:29:40] <timo> you'd want to pass the type object
[02:29:54] <timo> this is how NativeCall handles null in any case
[02:30:11] <m6locks> what would I check within the method?
[02:30:16] <m6locks> if (...)
[02:30:44] *** Joins: neshpion (~neshpion@gateway/tor-sasl/neshpion)
[02:31:09] <m6locks> I can't check if it's Nil, and the type object is clearly an object right?
[02:31:46] <timo> check for whether it's defined, using the "with" or "without" keywords
[02:31:58] <m6locks> ah ok, thanks
[02:36:35] <m6locks> can I combine it with an if? sort of like without $var or if ($obj.method() == 0)
[02:36:58] <m6locks> comma says that subroutine if is not declared
[02:38:33] <japhb> m6locks: `unless $var.defined && $obj.method {`
[02:38:40] <timo> are you writing stuff like "if($a, $b)"?
[02:38:46] <m6locks> yea
[02:38:47] <timo> er, not with a comma
[02:38:51] <m6locks> japhb: thanks
[02:38:56] <timo> well, that's a subroutine call, you don't put () with if and friends in raku
[02:55:20] <gfldex> timo: the order does change the execution time a good bit. Do you suspect the GC to successfully fooly me?
[03:00:00] <rassoc> m6locks: you can always do `if !$var.defined || $obj.method() == 0 { ... }` in case you absolutely want to keep them together
[03:01:47] <timo> not GC, i'd suspect dynamic optimization

[21:17:52] <rassoc> for the last 2 days i've been going through most of them chronologically, starting from 2010. for some i'm just too stupid
[21:24:26] <rassoc> gfldex: slick, i like the phaser usage!
[21:34:45] <gfldex> thank you
[21:36:11] <gfldex> With RakuAST macros I believe it would be possible to print the code that is being benchmarked instead of having to resort to .WHY .
[21:36:28] <gfldex> I'm already collecting ideas. :)
[21:37:56] <timo> shift the first measurement out of all the arrays in the END phaser :D
[21:43:33] <tonyo> you can just Bench ..
[21:43:50] <tonyo> and get a very nice table
[21:44:28] <timo> the reason to have custom code was to not pull in any outside modules for the blog post
[21:49:56] <timo> if we're really doing benchmarking, have we all clocked down our CPUs to the lowest setting to make sure thermals and boosting don't make our measurements useless? :D
[21:52:45] <rassoc> already running at the bare minimum because of all these intel vulnerability fixes :(
[21:54:14] <tonyo> ah, why not use telemetry?  that's in core 
[21:55:40] <tonyo> left a comment on that gist gfldex timo showing the output on M1
[22:10:49] <timo> looks like you're using a rakudo version that doesn't have "next with argument" yet
[22:10:54] <timo> that's only like two days old
[22:12:03] <tonyo> i'll rebuild & repost
