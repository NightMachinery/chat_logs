[05:01:15] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[05:01:19] <ButterNoodle> but I like my paycheck
[05:01:59] <ButterNoodle> speaking of paycheck
[05:02:01] <flyke> plus being overwhelmed with the anxienty on life responsabilities 
[05:02:07] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: found equinox elites
[05:02:33] <flyke> (being unemployed, insecure that life soon take a turnover)
[05:03:41] <flyke> (I just came here to vent my misery)
[05:03:50] <Cryowolf> flyke, can always get worse. Add cancer on top of that and you're me!
[05:06:18] <flyke> The most painful feeling to me is: regret on life choices.
[05:09:13] <flyke> Everything I could have tried, early age is a crucial point to lay the foundation for your career - All wasted on fantasizing, scratching balls playing games or watchin anime, a inert life.
[05:11:26] <flyke> Now I feel like I can't do anything but contemplate my life choices, I am past the crucial age on laying your foundation.
[05:11:34] <Cryowolf> I know how that feels. I spent a third of my life on s elf-destructive behavior that accomplished nothing, wasted everything and now I might not live for more than a couple of years more unless I'm one of the lucky ones. I've done nothing with my life and the thought of dying like that, it's a regret that weighs on me much heavier than cancer itself. That I knowingly, fully aware of it, wasted one of the most crucial points in a mans 
[05:11:34] <Cryowolf> life. If I die, I leave nothing behind except a void
[05:11:58] <Cryowolf> you're not, while you still have a life to live and breathe you can accomplish something
[05:12:11] <Cryowolf> maybe not what you wanted in full, but to look beyond that
[05:12:28] <Cryowolf> and find ways in which you can make yourself content
[05:12:39] <Cryowolf> if I survive for example, I'm going to tradeschool
[05:13:00] <Cryowolf> they actually have tradeschool for pathology roles
[05:14:22] <isekaijin> flyke: Don't worry, “productive” life isn't that much more meaningful, actually.
[05:14:33] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: what that
[05:14:35] <Cryowolf> You're in my position, except you have a greater chance of being alive in 4 years. You can still find something that gives you meaning
[05:15:04] <Cryowolf> isekaijin, a meaningful life is one that brings you meaning. Not one that makes society tell you it's meaningful
[05:15:16] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: what what
[05:16:14] <Cryowolf> so flyke, it's never too late unless you're dying or like so sick or crippled you can't do anything

[05:17:41] <Cryowolf> is that a bonus or is that the only way you will ever find meaning and happiness?

[05:18:43] <ButterNoodle> *never know if it makes u happy unless u try
[05:19:20] <Cryowolf> that's a little different than spending 10 years of your life in a drug-addled haze only to awaken, begin to reclaim your life and then bam cancer. Now I've wasted a decade of my life where I could have made a career and had a family and I might die never knowing anything
[05:19:33] <Cryowolf> and its nobodies fault but mine
[05:20:14] <ButterNoodle> other side of that.. what if that career and family made u more miserable then a self destructive lifestyle?

[05:21:42] <Cryowolf> that's not really possible since I consider drugs to be the greatest mistake of my life and I wish I had never touched the shit. Because it has melted 10 years of my life together into 1 day
[05:21:56] <Cryowolf> that's how much I did
[05:22:00] <Cryowolf> in 10 years
[05:22:05] <ButterNoodle> damn
[05:22:44] <ButterNoodle> I hope u beat the odds my friend and find some fulfillment
[05:22:45] <Cryowolf> That's my greatest regret because it's not something I can fix. If I survive this, I can build a future regardless. I can somewhat recover
[05:22:50] <Cryowolf> maybe do something
[05:22:56] <Cryowolf> but thats only if I survive

[05:23:27] <Cryowolf> I hope so too
[05:24:50] <Cryowolf> I was so ready to put in the work before the cancer came. I had quit cold turkey, on my own, at my own discretion, my own choice, not pressured by anyone. Then I worked out 5 days a week for nearly 2 years without a single relapse. Not one

[06:32:46] <omero> ave omnes ^.^~
[06:33:01] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I wonder if that shrine was material for a monogatari arc about snake possession.. 
[06:33:04] <amigojapan> Morning ghab13 
[06:33:10] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: wha how long is ur pp
[06:33:14] <ButterNoodle> will need to watch closely and look for comparisons
[06:33:32] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: at -40c.. its negative in/cm
[06:33:35] <ghab13> Wazzup
[06:33:39] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: no idea. It seems very remote, actually it is close to my house
[06:34:03] <ghab13> Japanese worship all animals, ig
[06:34:06] <ButterNoodle> cant wait for work or leisure travel
[06:34:12] <ButterNoodle> I have so many places I want to see
[06:34:34] <omero> i am going to rekindle the fireplace ... brrr
[06:34:40] <amigojapan> ghab13: I was surprised about snakes tho. And the statues of snakes in the video

[06:34:53] <ButterNoodle> ?
[06:34:54] <ghab13> Ooh
[06:35:14] <omero> doesnt work like that, ButterNoodle ... im well past that age ;)

[06:36:16] <ButterNoodle> call bullshit on u having consistent -40 temps unless ur above 50N parallel
[06:36:33] <amigojapan> Lol yeah ghab13 
[06:36:48] <emmeka> not actually necessary, the 50th parallel isn't a good marker of these things
[06:36:54] <omero> mmm
[06:37:03] <emmeka> Vancouver is north of the 50th parallel, and is the country's warmest city
[06:37:18] <ButterNoodle> true.. other circumcisions
[06:37:25] <ButterNoodle> like ocean breeze
[06:37:41] <ButterNoodle> which is why the UK isnt a fucking Popsicle
[06:38:04] <omero> no.
[06:38:11] <ButterNoodle> yes.
[06:38:14] <emmeka> I'm only at like the 49th parallel, but reasonably close to the arctic ocean and far from the great lakes, so it gets frosty
[06:38:25] <omero> that is due to the 23~ axis inclination
[06:38:26] <ButterNoodle> imaginably so
[06:38:33] <ButterNoodle> ?
[06:38:37] <ButterNoodle> yea no

[06:39:58] <omero> erastotene was too.
[06:40:08] <ButterNoodle> if u gonna hang ur hat on that.. then that temp would be the same across the entire parallel
[06:40:11] <ButterNoodle> gg
[06:40:14] <amigojapan> ghab13: that's a kamidana
[06:40:19] <ButterNoodle> *smart people
[06:40:20] <emmeka> omero Europe is just guilty of heat imperialism, London is at the same lattitudes as permafrost at my longitude.
[06:40:30] <omero> lol
[06:40:37] <omero> emmeka: hello
[06:40:44] <ghab13> Ooh
[06:40:45] <omero> i understand
[06:40:49] <amigojapan> ghab13: kind of mini temple inside someone's house
[06:40:50] <ghab13> I dont see any difference 
[06:40:51] <ButterNoodle> they did however help trump flat earthers
[06:41:18] <ButterNoodle> so
[06:41:21] <ButterNoodle> fucking
[06:41:22] <ButterNoodle> boaring
[06:41:29] <omero> i still fail to understand the inches and foots
[06:41:33] <omero> feet?
[06:41:40] <ButterNoodle> well either way
[06:41:57] <ghab13> How about nambujinja shrine
[06:41:58] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: we should make a temple that worships globes :)
[06:42:04] <ButterNoodle> feet are the best thing about imperial units
[06:42:10] <Sadale> 1 inch = 2.54cm ...?
[06:42:16] <ButterNoodle> ~
[06:42:19] <amigojapan> I don't know it ghab13 
[06:42:19] <omero> oh I can agree on that ButterNoodle :)
[06:42:20] <Sadale> and 12 inches = 1 foot
[06:42:20] <emmeka> ButterNoodle the other day it was -43°C here and the potentiometer on my car's throttle froze solid and threw the car's electronics into limp mode
[06:42:25] <ButterNoodle> close enough for conversation Sadale 
[06:42:35] <ButterNoodle> I do the F to C conversions in my head
[06:42:45] <omero> you know... some time ago, we used ... the lenght of an arm
[06:42:49] <Sadale> I actually don't like imperial unit. Funny how widely it's being used here in Hong Kong (China).
[06:43:01] <ButterNoodle> metric is nice
[06:43:06] <ButterNoodle> but so are feet
[06:43:07] <emmeka> nice thing is -40 is the same F/C
[06:43:11] <ButterNoodle> ^^
[06:43:13] <emmeka> "nice" thing
[06:43:14] <ButterNoodle> ez
[06:43:18] <Sadale> For daily use, we use metric unit. However, if you go into hardware store, the people there often use imperial unit
[06:43:36] <emmeka> I had to learn 3 systems of measurement
[06:43:37] <ButterNoodle> when I was a machinist.. I would frequently have to use both
[06:43:45] <ButterNoodle> sometimes on the same job :| which is fucked up
[06:43:52] <emmeka> they actually tested our ability to freely convert between them in ag college
[06:43:53] <omero> i can understand feet. when it belongs to lovely creatures
[06:44:10] <amigojapan> emmeka: it's (F)ucking (C)old

[06:44:17] <ButterNoodle> an american made part that needs to be mounted on a japanese made unit..
[06:44:31] <ButterNoodle> the best thing about metric tho
[06:44:33] <ghab13> They hab one in cat island
[06:44:37] <ghab13> I think
[06:44:38] <ButterNoodle> a yard is about a meter...
[06:44:44] <ghab13> I dont read blogs
[06:44:46] <ButterNoodle> and u get 3 feet in yard
[06:44:52] <omero> lol
[06:45:04] <omero> how is that precise?
[06:45:05] <ButterNoodle> so 2 meters of cute = 30 toes to suck on
[06:45:13] <omero> fraction them and you get a mess
[06:45:15] <ButterNoodle> *about is not precise
[06:45:16] <ghab13> Isnt meter 4ft
[06:45:22] <Sadale> lol
[06:45:23] <omero> nope
[06:45:27] <ghab13> Oh
[06:45:27] <ButterNoodle> !c 1m to ft
[06:45:28] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: 1 Meter = 3.28084 Foot
[06:45:30] <emmeka> what's annoying is imperial units don't have consistent factors
[06:45:32] <ButterNoodle> no
[06:45:32] <ghab13> Oh
[06:45:42] <ButterNoodle> so
[06:45:46] <omero> tell that to nasa emmeka 
[06:46:01] <omero> they learned it the (y)hard way
[06:46:01] <ButterNoodle> there are 3 cute girls with a total of 30 toes in 2 meters.. ez
[06:46:05] <ghab13> !c 1yard to ft
[06:46:06] <ImoutoBot> ghab13: 1 Yard = 3 Foot
[06:46:08] <ButterNoodle> *and 6 feet
[06:46:08] <ghab13> Oh
[06:46:11] <amigojapan> ghab13: nice
[06:46:17] <ghab13> So meter longer by a bit
[06:46:22] <ghab13> Like why
[06:46:23] <ButterNoodle> its the stuff dreams are made of
[06:46:28] <ButterNoodle> idk
[06:46:36] <ButterNoodle> cause metric too boo kuu?

[07:00:24] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it's too expensive. At least for me. 99usd per month plus 500usd for the transmitter
[07:00:32] <ButterNoodle> prefer it to just be a lump
[07:00:36] <omero> once is I, its too late
[07:00:38] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: wow
[07:00:40] <ButterNoodle> well
[07:00:44] <ButterNoodle> it will come down in price
[07:01:12] <omero> the AI will fuck you. before you know.
[07:01:16] <ButterNoodle> I mean if the latency isnt shit.. and the speeds are high -- I pay 2x that for internet rn
[07:01:24] <ButterNoodle> omero: I hope
[07:01:28] <omero> lol
[07:01:33] <omero> good one, ButterNoodle 
[07:01:46] <omero> not sure you would like it
[07:01:56] <emmeka> Starlink isn't really made for you, amigojapan
[07:01:59] <ButterNoodle> thats about the only way many of us weebs and neets gonna get lucky
[07:02:05] <emmeka> Starlink is made for people like me
[07:02:14] <emmeka> without access to the fibreoptic grid
[07:02:36] <omero> someone tried doing starlink before. it was a different project. 
[07:02:38] <emmeka> it's expensive, but way way faster than any alternative
[07:02:46] <amigojapan> emmeka: right, and poor people in countries without infrastructure they said
[07:02:53] <ButterNoodle> was that part of iridium omero
[07:03:00] <omero> was called something less ... evocative
[07:03:04] <emmeka> omero there's multiple countries doing Starlink-like projects of their own, including the Canadian federal government
[07:03:15] <omero> a metal, ButterNoodle 
[07:03:16] <emmeka> nobody cares about that though, because Elon Musk doesn't tweet about it, I guess
[07:03:18] <ButterNoodle> globalsat and iridium are still there
[07:03:35] <ButterNoodle> but real expensive.. like internet on ur phone in the 90s expensive 
[07:03:51] <ButterNoodle> pay by the KB
[07:03:58] <omero> and quite ... useless :P
[07:04:00] <emmeka> amigojapan subscribing to Starlink would require actually giving money to Elon Musk and validating his existence, so I can't
[07:04:14] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: u dont like papa elon?
[07:04:20] <emmeka> nah, he's a dickwad
[07:04:32] <amigojapan> I see emmeka 
[07:04:33] <ButterNoodle> u sure?
[07:04:47] <ButterNoodle> maybe u thinking of jeff bazos
[07:04:52] <emmeka> dude's a marketing genius don't get me wrong, would've thrived as a salesman
[07:04:58] <emmeka> but he's garbage as a capitalist
[07:05:49] <omero> ^^
[07:05:49] <MootPoot> anime
[07:06:29] <omero> I am going to rewatch Gundam **
[07:06:34] <amigojapan> emmeka: it could probably make much more money by charging 20usd per month and having everyone join it
[07:06:39] <emmeka> everything he touches hemorrhages money because he sinks everything into hairbrained dumb projects that sound like he thought them up while stoned with his buddies, the actual production processes at his companies are a nightmare (Tesla has never, once, ever, met a quarterly production goal)
[07:06:41] <omero> oops... I meant Gundam DD
[07:06:51] <omero> oops... I meant Gundam 00
[07:07:03] <emmeka> like Tesla has lost money forever
[07:07:15] <MootPoot> emmeka: I feel very employable
[07:07:18] <MootPoot> right now
[07:07:25] <MootPoot> the late game luck is hitting
[07:07:27] <omero> maybe after 00 will also rewatch Unicorn :)
[07:07:34] <MootPoot> I'm getting interview calls literally thrown at me
[07:07:38] <MootPoot> idk what I did
[07:07:40] <ButterNoodle> I mean.. have they filed bankruptcy like *almost every american auto maker?
[07:07:56] <MootPoot> who hasen't filed for bankrupcy?
[07:07:59] <ButterNoodle> ford
[07:08:01] <ButterNoodle> tesla
[07:08:04] <ButterNoodle> spacex
[07:08:04] <omero> whats that... chapter 34??
[07:08:06] <MootPoot> iz this true
[07:08:08] <emmeka> the automakers just do that because they know it means the government teat will be made available
[07:08:40] <omero> or catch 22... cant remember
[07:08:40] <emmeka> and also Musk has fanboys who will print money for him on demand more or less
[07:08:52] <ButterNoodle> no emmeka they do that so they can get out of paying their non union parts supplies..
[07:08:54] <Macer> blah
[07:08:55] <ButterNoodle> and still make money
[07:09:00] <Macer> guess mosh doesn't allow ssh to do port forwarding 
[07:09:06] <emmeka> ButterNoodle that too. I was one of them.
[07:09:19] <omero> they dont need diamonds
[07:09:29] <ButterNoodle> thats fucking dirty imho
[07:09:42] <omero> bit. 0 or 1
[07:09:43] <emmeka> worked at a non-union supplier making headlights and taillights for the major manufacturers
[07:09:48] <emmeka> as a teenager
[07:10:00] <ButterNoodle> around the bust..
[07:10:08] <emmeka> yep.
[07:10:33] <omero> what is most in demand
[07:10:47] <emmeka> minimum wage on a temp contract, 12 hour shifts, but it was a time you took what you could get
[07:11:08] <Sadale> sad :(
[07:11:10] <omero> yes
[07:11:23] <MootPoot> does a link to a DB count as a API
[07:12:07] <omero> is that rethorical? or rhetorical MootPoot 
[07:12:17] <MootPoot> I'm doing a code test for a job right now
[07:12:32] <MootPoot> want me to fetch some data with a API - but this data is custom 
[07:12:34] <omero> then its 0 or 1
[07:12:56] <MootPoot> so I did it with a SQL DB I linked my application to, I'm just wondering if that counts as an API
[07:13:10] <MootPoot> since it explicitly said you have to do it with an api
[07:13:25] <omero> an api is an interface
[07:13:35] <MootPoot> I guess it goes through the SQL server interface then
[07:13:36] <MootPoot> sweet
[07:13:40] <omero> an abstract
[07:13:44] <omero> interface
[07:14:09] <omero> the p is purely cosmethics
[07:14:32] <omero> thus what is the real question
[07:15:06] <emmeka> MootPoot so did you see what I said earlier
[07:15:14] <emmeka> MootPoot I got stuck in the trucker convoy, lol
[07:15:21] <MootPoot> lol
[07:15:51] <emmeka> fuckers clogged up the whole highway. lot of em though. and apparently the convoy on 17 is bigger.
[07:16:04] <emmeka> Ottawa's gonna be gridlocked, don't know how that's gonna go

[08:04:26] <amigojapan> Ouch

[08:04:58] <omero> cappuccino isnt made with medieval tools of torture

[08:06:35] <amigojapan> I am the man with the medival tool of torture
[08:07:45] <Sadale> lolwut?
[08:08:27] <omero> the perfect cappuccino is coffee made with a moka machine (we discussed this already), then add milk which has to be warm, not shaked.
[08:09:23] <omero> the foam is because the milk has to be heated to the point before it boils, while stirred
[08:09:30] <amigojapan> omero: what do you call coffee with foam on top?
[08:09:43] <omero> its cappuccino, amigojapan :D
[08:10:00] <omero> but you probably have no idea why its called like that
[08:10:15] <amigojapan> omero: in Mexico capucha means hat
[08:10:16] <omero> a cappuccino is also the word for a monk
[08:10:21] <omero> yes
[08:10:58] <omero> that is a man, that wears a dark dress
[08:11:06] <omero> with a white hood
[08:11:22] <amigojapan> Ah so it is hood
[08:11:29] <omero> yes
[08:11:37] <omero> cappuccino is a friar
[08:11:41] <omero> a monk
[08:11:43] <amigojapan> Ah ok that makes sense in Spanish
[08:11:45] <omero> a kind of one
[08:11:52] <omero> yes
[08:12:08] <omero> because of many reasons and many meanings
[08:12:13] <omero> its latin after all
[08:12:16] <omero> cappuccio
[08:12:19] <omero> the hood
[08:12:21] <amigojapan> Yup
[08:12:43] <omero> it is something that folks across the world miss
[08:12:52] <omero> the real origin of the concept
[08:13:09] <omero> it was somewhat ... a joke
[08:13:12] <omero> a pun
[08:13:34] <omero> you know... friars werent always welcome

[08:14:26] <omero> its complicated

[08:18:12] <omero> a mail can be sent like that
[08:18:20] <omero> it means fast?
[08:18:26] <omero> or it means ... under pressure
[08:18:35] <omero> depends on the context
[08:18:48] <omero> but context derives from 'contesto'
[08:19:00] <omero> contesto means 'with text'
[08:19:18] <Sadale> Italian?
[08:19:19] <omero> all those words are derived from latin

[08:19:51] <Sadale> amigojapan, I think the express ones are actually more expensive to ride on, are they? :o

[10:15:13] <ButterNoodle> it wasnt always oracle
[10:15:17] <ButterNoodle> it was an acquisition

[10:40:40] <Nanobot> "!c" is a bazillion things, and ImoutoBot doesn't know what you're using it for. It just sends the query to Google and says "give me an answer", and Google responds in one of the 15 trillion different ways it presents answers.
[10:41:21] <Nanobot> ImoutoBot tries her best to parse the responses. It supports like a dozen or so different ways that Google expresses answers, but Google changes it all the time.
[10:41:45] * MootPoot pets ImoutoBot 
[10:42:17] <Nanobot> Really, "!c" just does a Google search and tries to scrape the resulting HTML for the quick answer boxes.

[11:26:34] <Sadale> ah.
[11:26:34] <MootPoot> like dental care - glasses - etc
[11:26:49] <MootPoot> so to help with those you can get additional insurance thorugh your work
[11:26:56] <MootPoot> or you can just buy it
[11:27:13] <MootPoot> so the way my plan works is that I just pay 20% of the cost and insruance pays 80% of whatever the thing is
[11:27:15] <Sadale> Basically I'm just rolling my dice and hope that I would never get sick. I've got no health insurance xD
[11:27:42] <MootPoot> often the idea is that they make their plans more attractive by offering what is called "wellness services included"
[11:27:47] <Sadale> My work does offer insurance tho. But it's just better than nothing and it's meant for protecting the coworkers from incident at work
[11:27:54] <MootPoot> so wellness is stuff liek yoga, massages etc
[11:28:11] <MootPoot> they bet on the fact that most people dont utilize it so it makes it all worth it for them

[17:44:57] <Sadale> they may have purchased the followers

[17:47:16] <flyke> or it's just pure luck
[17:47:49] <Sadale> I'd say the purchased the followers with money. The account may not even be profitable to them because most of the followers there are actually bots.
[17:47:55] <Sadale> they*
[17:48:38] <flyke> Aren't there deterministic factors we can exploit to achieve viralness
[17:48:43] <Sadale> I doubt so.
[17:50:09] <flyke> > I'd say the purchased the followers with money. The account may not even be profitable to them because most of the followers there are actually bots.
[17:50:20] <flyke> that is a wiiiild thought
[17:50:24] <Sadale> I bet that luck plays a huge factor here. With so much content floating around on the internet, even higher quality content wouldn't get discovered. The market is saturated.
[17:50:41] <flyke> true

[17:51:13] <Sadale> But it's useless. The vid isn't going anywhere because the viewers are bots.

[17:55:46] <flyke> Sadale, I think you're right, luck seems to play a huge factor, for example: I want to be gamedev and make a popular game, so I research how popular games got popular...

[18:42:40] <emmeka> Sadale the patriote flag is the symbol of left wing Québec separatists, for it to fly alongside the Canadian flag is strange.

[21:33:49] <DaPinkOne> I'm still salty about the seminar though. I don't wanna :(
[21:34:06] <sentionics> I hold a lot of distrust; I guess it's just my nature
[21:34:36] <DaPinkOne> I had prof A last semester, and he was pretty good. Good enough I choose him specifically for this semester.
[21:35:08] <sentionics> DaPinkOne, if you have a prof that's keen, that's beyond good. Work with them.
[21:35:20] <DaPinkOne> so I'm just gonna give him the benefit of the doubt that it's the tech, not his knowledge that's made it shit
[21:35:41] <sentionics> I should have worked more with my favourite prof's
[21:35:42] <DaPinkOne> prof B has also had some tech issues, but she seems to have it together on the whole
[21:36:04] <sentionics> I'm an ass though so I do everything alone
[21:36:35] <sentionics> DaPinkOne, just by the sounds of it, I like prof B
[21:36:50] <DaPinkOne> I'd prefer to work with a group, but the opportunity just hasn't been there. I could work in a group for Prof B's stuff, but if I work in a group I have to do a group reflection paper thing

[21:39:23] <sentionics> do not owe it
[21:39:27] <DaPinkOne> most of the time group work is shitty, and I don't really want to be a project manager.

[21:40:38] <DaPinkOne> I've never had a project manager for dev work, I don't wanna just wing this shit, and the group doesn't generally want a project manager either

[21:41:47] <DaPinkOne> I did need a group for physics and for some of the maths, but i haven't needed one for the comp sci stuff
[21:42:10] <DaPinkOne> there's nothing to own. i'm studying for midterms
[21:42:12] <flyke> I had gone on the same situation on a group assignment.

[21:42:40] <sentionics> you don't want to face it. You have work to do

[21:43:09] <sentionics> sorry if I'm misreading or whatever
[21:43:24] <DaPinkOne> if you're saying I should be working, I'm always working
[21:43:43] <sentionics> I guess so
[21:43:48] <DaPinkOne> this conversation is on my break. i'm heading back to it soon.
[21:44:02] <sentionics> sorry, I felt you were unmotivated
[21:44:07] <DaPinkOne> I've been on this grind 6-7 days a week since the semester started
[21:44:37] <DaPinkOne> nah, i'm motivated, I just wish I could work in a group with a project/team lead that isn't me.
[21:44:44] <sentionics> DaPinkOne, where ever you go, wherever you are, may happiness always follow you
[21:45:09] <DaPinkOne> thanks mate, you too :)
[21:45:16] <flyke> We had to make a site, there was no leader, we unanimously agreed on things. Initally everything was on tracks and organized, we were on the initial phase writting out the design document and then we would go to the UI and then implementation...
[21:45:24] <sentionics> aye aye cap'n
[21:45:33] <flyke> Then slowly the group ghosted
[21:45:50] <flyke> Progression was stalled
[21:46:20] <flyke> But noone took action, there was no leader to call out the other members, noone took the baston.
[21:46:48] <flyke> We were(at least me) just waiting who would lead and get the project back on tracks..
[21:46:54] <DaPinkOne> flyke, group work usually has a) the lazy guy(may be invested in other work, not this work), b) the smart guy(very good, but not a lot of time to invest, c) the anchor(the guy who pulls the all-nighters to finish at crunch)
[21:47:35] <flyke> I would call the smart guy, though I'm not knowledged on site making lol. the others wore more rookie
[21:48:35] <flyke> One dude was always busy with other things. Rearely appeared on our google meet calls.

[21:51:58] <flyke> DaPinkOne: Then I talked with the teacher begging him to give me more days to finnish the project, and he was very nice and gave me more days. 
[21:52:35] <flyke> I didn't sleep the next days, building the site alone from the ground up, burned myself out, but I finnished it. 
[21:52:47] <flyke> all alone

[21:53:44] <DaPinkOne> i've gotten extensions of weeks at a time from profs who "don't do extensions", just 'cause I went in person and discussed the issues
[21:54:25] <DaPinkOne> it's harder to say no when the already acknowledge you as a person with a previously good track record
[21:56:07] <emmeka> MootPoot so CBC just reported that the Prime Minister and his family have went into hiding
[21:56:27] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, what're they hiding from?
[21:56:33] <emmeka> or, excuse me, "have been moved to an undisclosed location"
[21:56:49] <DaPinkOne> is canada gonna lead the revolution?
[21:56:50] <emmeka> DaPinkOne the truckers. there's a thing happening.
[21:57:44] <DaPinkOne> oh no, that doesn't look great
[21:58:29] <emmeka> DaPinkOne there's convoys of trucks currently gridlocking the capital city in protest of vaccine mandates for truckers. Thousands of them out there. It's something.
[21:59:02] <DaPinkOne> logistics is actually kindof a fragile balance because of just-in-time systems
[21:59:23] <DaPinkOne> I guess truckers would be aware of that...being that they're in logistics
[21:59:55] <emmeka> if there's anything positive about the supply chain woes, I hope it convinces industry to abandon JIT shipping
[22:00:00] <Jigsy> The truckers have hostages.
[22:00:13] <Jigsy> If their demands aren't met, they will waste ONE bottle of Maple Syrup every hour.
[22:00:20] <Urchin[emacs]> use of JIT outside of Japan is pretty much cago cult management
[22:00:52] <emmeka> yeah it's like this deliberate attempt to emulate Toyota et al's successes without actually accomplishing anything
[22:01:05] <emmeka> Japan has a unique business climate of endless layers of subcontractors that allows these things
[22:01:10] <DaPinkOne> JIT is just a method of managing supply. it's not something crazy
[22:01:32] <DaPinkOne> it usually works pretty well
[22:01:43] <emmeka> DaPinkOne right, it's managing it in the sense of keeping it as lean as possible. this works, until it doesn't.
[22:02:03] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, well, the same could be said for the alternatives
[22:02:10] <emmeka> an economy with no slack is efficient but vulnerable, we're learning this
[22:02:24] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: more to the point, Japan had an actual need for it, and they've since stocked up on long lead-time stuff since a disaster or two ago, so they're not on pure JIT any more
[22:02:38] <flyke> DaPinkOne: I read the teacher's personality to see whether if they can give leniency. I can tell when a teacher has a strict personality.
[22:03:30] <flyke> (Of course a habit im trying to avoid)
[22:03:54] <DaPinkOne> flyke, you've gotta be kinda flexible. Some profs expect you to learn differently, and you've gotta be willing to do that

[22:07:25] <Jigsy> Isn't there a snowstorm in Canada like, every week?
[22:07:35] <emmeka> all cities besides Toronto continue to function normally when there's major blizzards
[22:07:38] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, as an american, I just assume it's snowing in all of canada like 9 months out of the year
[22:07:46] <emmeka> not wrong
[22:08:08] <Jigsy> So what three months don't have snow?
[22:08:12] <emmeka> there's typically snow where I live from mid October until mid April
[22:08:18] <emmeka> which is 6 months, I guess.

[22:16:07] <DaPinkOne> that...seems very annoying. probably worse than the mississippi mosquitos
[22:16:30] <emmeka> they're typically worst in close proximity to bodies of water
[22:16:45] <emmeka> the problem is, this is the north, there's lakes and rivers everywhere

[22:17:13] <DaPinkOne> I used to live across the street from a pond, you could see the mosquitos swarming in sunset/twilight for several hours
[22:17:15] <emmeka> they're also worst in the early days of summer, and reduce as it goes into August
[22:17:34] <emmeka> blackflies aren't bloodsuckers, actually. They literally bite off flesh.
[22:17:42] <DaPinkOne> ouch
[22:17:55] <emmeka> they can eat through a layer of skin and leave you bleeding

[22:20:37] <DaPinkOne> does smoke keep them at bay?
[22:20:53] <emmeka> it does, apparently they especially don't like balsam
[22:21:05] <emmeka> balsam fir, either the wood or the pitch
[22:21:45] <emmeka> they're also the opposite of mosquitos, they are only active during during daylight, typically worst right before dusk but then disappear as the sun sets

[22:24:15] <emmeka> DaPinkOne no we also have mosquitos
[22:24:44] <DaPinkOne> I guess if there's flies taking pounds of flesh, the occasional mosquito bite is negligable
[22:24:52] <emmeka> but mosquitos are actually worse in the warmer parts of the country, and blackflies are worse in the north
