[00:32:42] <distant[m]> I found a dirty workaround, but I don't like it.
[00:34:02] <distant[m]> I replaced `Gem::Specification.load_defaults` with this...

[00:34:23] <distant[m]> After that it loaded fine...
[00:34:36] <distant[m]> But I would really like it to load properly...
[00:49:48] <headius> I haven't been following along but it sounds like a reasonable use case to support

[01:15:45] <distant[m]> I try. :>
[01:16:14] <distant[m]> Still need to get a Gradle plugin working, otherwise it can't be used for Fabric/Minecraft...
[01:16:26] <distant[m]> (It can still work with other games just fine, Loom's only used for Minecraft.)
[01:17:35] <headius> I'm not in the office until tomorrow but maybe we can figure something out then, or enebo  will have some additional thoughts
[01:20:14] <enebo[m]> distant: For the unknowm method I believe it is not picking up the ruby lib directory (unless you are using ruby-core or something which is not including lib/ruby at all)
[01:21:50] <enebo[m]> distant: It might be needing something like: -Djruby.lib="$JRUBY_HOME/lib"
[01:22:04] <enebo[m]> where you pass in the proper location
[01:22:23] <enebo[m]> but I would use jruby-complete if you are not and then rubygems should be seen
[01:30:43] <distant[m]> <enebo[m]> "distant: For the unknowm..." <- It's running Ruby code...
[01:30:51] <distant[m]> ðŸ¤”
[01:31:19] <distant[m]> <distant[m]> "ew.png" <- I just had to break this to make it work.
[01:31:54] <distant[m]> Though I'm just pulling the `jruby` package...
[01:32:06] <distant[m]> Should I pull complete?
[01:32:38] <enebo[m]> When Ruby starts it tries to load rubygems on startup.  You are running ruby but the runtime starting up is trying to load rubygems and it would appear to not be finding it
[01:32:46] <enebo[m]> jruby-complete probably will not have this issue
[01:32:57] <enebo[m]> since all of ruby stdlib is within the jar
[01:33:27] <distant[m]> Alright, I'll try it.
[01:34:06] <distant[m]> This is going to be one massive jar doe...
[01:34:24] <distant[m]> (At least as far as mods go...)
[01:38:00] <distant[m]> <enebo[m]> "jruby-complete probably will not..." <- Still has the issue.
[01:38:08] <distant[m]> ;-;
[01:39:01] <distant[m]> Though it did add a noticeable chonk of Ruby, and is still fixable by just changing that one file to be bad, so I have no reason to revert.
[01:43:31] <enebo[m]> ./lib/ruby/stdlib/rubygems/specification.rb:  def self.load_defaults
[01:43:48] <enebo[m]> I find it weird to see this not found when it is being called from a file which is pretty much in the same location
[01:45:28] *** Joins: subbu (~subbu@user/subbu)
[01:46:16] <enebo[m]> It is a weird error because I see a require_relative about 14 lines above which is require_relative on the file which defines that method

[03:51:26] <distant[m]> enebo: I think I had a epiphany
[03:51:51] <distant[m]> I made a new instance of Gem::Specification, then called `load_defaults` from that instance, and that worked.
[03:53:04] <distant[m]> So either the load order became slightly fucked (only enough to break that one thing somehow), or it's some problem with newer versions of Java (Minecraft 1.17+ requires at least Java 16).
[03:53:48] <distant[m]> I just need to figure out how I'm going to make that change in the build, and how to get it working with Gradle now...
[03:54:04] <distant[m]> And the thing would be pretty much ready to ship...
[04:49:03] <headius> Could be something related to modules, which hide resources from foreign jars
[04:49:33] <headius> If you can show an example or push a repo that you think should work we can see the problems more easily

[18:48:06] <distant[m]> <headius> "If you can show an example or..." <- It appears as though Fabric API is incompatible with JRuby somehow. O_O
[18:48:23] <distant[m]> The issue wasn't being caused by how it was shaded, or by Fabric Loader...
[18:48:33] <distant[m]> Without Fabric API, it loads just fine...
[18:48:40] <distant[m]> It also loads just fine on other games...
[18:48:53] <distant[m]> It's specifically the Minecraft modding API that braeks it. O_O
[18:49:08] <distant[m]> By messing around with it, I was able to figure out exactly what the problem was.

[18:54:41] <distant[m]> Does JRuby do anything funky with the classloader?
[19:01:49] <distant[m]> It uses ASM, that was the oopsie.
[19:02:08] <distant[m]> Fabric also uses ASM, the lib was bundled twice.
[19:02:19] <distant[m]> But why would the Minecraft Fabric API trip that out? ðŸ¤”
[19:02:35] <distant[m]> If I exclude it, it should be fine then.
[19:30:14] *** Quits: MateuszFryc[m] (~lirimaery@2001:470:69fc:105::1:3640) (Quit: You have been kicked for being idle)
[19:52:46] <distant[m]> Yep, excluding ASM allows it to work fine with no additional changes.
[19:53:03] <distant[m]> Still need to solve that damn Gradle issue though...
[19:53:24] <distant[m]> It looks like the `jruby-gradle` package in Gradle's plugin portal is out of date, actually...
[19:53:36] <distant[m]> There are commits that came after the last release there.
[19:54:10] <distant[m]> Is there a maven repo with a more up-to-date release?
[20:23:56] <distant[m]> How do I define a `java_signature` for `public <T> T create(Class<T> clazz)`?
