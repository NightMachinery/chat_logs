[00:09:40] <trafficjam> that is my issue,i want it to remain 1.1.1.1
[00:10:10] <leftyfb> trafficjam: It probably is. To find your configured nameservers, run systemd-resolve --status | grep --color=auto "DNS Servers"
[00:10:44] <leftyfb> trafficjam: nameservers should be configured in network manager or in netplan, not in /etc/resolv.conf

[00:13:51] <trafficjam> only works if i set it to 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, etc
[00:13:51] <leftyfb> trafficjam: setting your nameserver to 1.1.1.1 will most certainly prevent you from resolving local hostnames

[00:14:56] *** Joins: shuck (~shuck@user/shuck)
[00:15:20] <leftyfb> trafficjam: if you want to resolve local hostnames, then your DHCP server should be handing out ONLY the ip of your local resolver, typically your gateway/router. Your router is usually then configured to use some public nameserver like 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 for dns forwarding to external networks

[00:20:59] *** Joins: shuck (~shuck@user/shuck)
[00:21:37] <leftyfb> trafficjam: it's very possible(if they were smart) the hotel has disabled local DNS

[03:48:45] <eflister95> i'll give it a try, is it just ssh <ip> ?

[03:53:14] <zenof> okay, strange enough, so, at least you didn't install an ssh server manually.  can you at least ping your ubuntu?
[03:53:25] <eflister95> yeah ping works
[03:53:57] <zenof> does you router block any ports?
[03:54:46] <eflister95> i never set any blocks up, would it by default?  when i dig through its setup pages i don't see anything like that, any way to verify?
[03:55:43] <zenof> maybe something like "allow clients to..."
[03:57:08] <eflister95> would it be under "block services"?  nothing under there
[03:57:22] <zenof> well you could do a  nmap -p 5900 yourIPhere
[03:57:31] <zenof> which is the vnc standard port.
[03:58:19] <zenof> I have a setting in my router that is more general, like a "let clients see each other or not"

[08:56:40] <eflister> i think i just destroyed my ubuntu install by trying to install retropie following the instructions at https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Debian/#download-retropie -- i was thinking it would install a regular application, but it looks like it started removing every aspect of my ubuntu install and trying to make itself the main OS.  is this what it is
[08:56:41] <eflister> supposed to do?  is there any way to recover?  it even removed the network apps/drivers, so i don't even have internet on that machine anymore...  is it possible to reinstall everything in apt's cache?

[08:58:26] <oerheks> eflister, good luck!
[09:01:05] <KBar> eflister: when did you notice that? How many packages got removed before you were able to terminate the process?
[09:01:11] <oerheks> boot an ubuntu iso and reinstall
[09:01:26] <oerheks> KBar,  he might have ended up with a 32 bit system
[09:01:36] <KBar> eflister: if not many, you can try reinstalling those packages. Otherwise, reinstall is your best bet as suggested by oerheks.
[09:01:39] <oerheks> beyond repair
[09:01:51] <eflister> KBar: it died on its own, seems to have removed most everything
[09:02:06] <KBar> eflister: install Ubuntu afresh.

[09:06:09] <ComputerTech> sorry
[09:06:11] <KBar> This channel is for Ubuntu support.
[09:07:03] <ComputerTech> Actually i have a question of Ubuntu, will booting Ubuntu desktop from USB be the same performance as booting from a installation from Harddrive?
[09:07:27] <KBar> ComputerTech: that depends on multiple factors, primarily hardware spec.
[09:07:30] <KBar> specs*
[09:07:34] <ComputerTech> I see
[09:07:49] <ComputerTech> well does booting from USB still use the RAM of the PC?
[09:07:59] <ComputerTech> or it creates swap memory with the USB?
[09:08:24] <oerheks> interesting questions
[09:08:52] <oerheks> please answer them yourself, ComputerTech ?
[09:08:54] <PeGaSuS> obviously it will use the laptop/desktop RAM. it would be a 1st to have CPU, RAM and other hardware inside a USB stick :)
[09:09:09] <KBar> Just download more RAM, if it can't.
[09:09:12] <ComputerTech> lol
[09:09:22] * ComputerTech downloads some RAM, ;D

[12:20:04] <nikolam> I am on HP 600 G1 Tower, i5 4570 16GBRAM, and I see that memtest86+ from inside Ubuntu 21.10 GRUB (and may be before) throws so many memory errors at me beyond first 4GB, and memtest86 (proprietary) memory test passes the memory while testing in 3 passes for several hours.
[12:20:35] <nikolam> I can guess that then , even for such old PC, memtest86+ is not viable memory test anymore.

[12:22:07] <nikolam> I started testing RAM, after Firefox Developer and Firefox nightly (from Mozilla) started popping up tome crashed tabs and crashing, without core dump. And Firefox release sometimes locking the whole machine, when it fills the RAM (happens before too), also Mozilla build.
[12:22:11] <gordonjcp> nikolam: possibly?
[12:22:33] <gordonjcp> have you tried different RAM in it?  Is the RAM the right stuff for the board?
[12:22:46] <nikolam> Does Firefox in snap have some if any memory limitations not to lock the whole machine up
[12:23:44] *** Joins: HyN0X (~HyNoX@151.47.175.129)
[12:23:49] <nikolam> gordonjcp, I tried all the combinations, only the combination when only the first slot is populated with exactly one 4GB stick, works for memtest86+ , everything else pops up the error. And it is not dependeble on what RAM is put in.
[12:24:29] <nikolam> So basically when memtest86+ starts testing above 4GB it fails with testing, spitting an error.

[14:10:43] <phr34k> I've been seeing a lot of slowdowns with connections when dns is involved, and looks like the ipv6 on the vps is not actually configured with the eth interface.
[14:12:06] <phr34k> this pretty much contains the instructions that I'm following, https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/ipv6/how-to/enable/ - but I want to confirm how the networking config file should look, since I assume if i screw it up I will lock myself out of the box

[14:13:21] <KBar> m4dmood: there are many aspects to performance besides CPU model. Eliminate hardware issues first.
[14:14:04] <m4dmood> For example the RAM you mean? I mount 12 GB on laptop and 16 on Intel pc
[14:14:07] <KBar> m4dmood: it could be memory, disk drive, etc.
[14:14:12] <KBar> Tons of variables.
[14:16:27] <KBar> m4dmood: I'd check each one by one. Does the affected system run on GNOME?
