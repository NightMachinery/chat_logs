[04:19:27] <anton> the value of an NFT comes from "(1) it can't be copied because it has a signature and (2) others may in the future pay even more for it"
[04:19:30] <linext> but if the artwork can be viewed, why can't it be copied?
[04:21:50] <Maximalist> The value is in the fact your ownership to the NFT is cryptographically secure
[04:21:58] <Maximalist> Youre the only one with the private key
[04:22:02] <linext> ah, so you have the receipt
[04:22:22] <linext> so only you can legally resell it

[04:23:59] <damo22> you can sell non-free software in some cases

[04:24:31] <isf> in terms of free software if you sell it or not that isnt important damo22
[04:24:35] <damo22> only cases where you dont actually get a copy or you get a defective copy are you prevented
[04:24:46] <linext> i guess software would be a poor NFT
[04:24:53] <linext> since it's mass produced and identical
[04:24:55] <isf> you never can have the control of your computing in nonfree softwware

[04:25:34] <isf> but you can do all what you want with all you have, (if are your like free software copy etc)
[04:25:34] <linext> you can put the software in a locked down VM
[04:25:50] <damo22> isf: nonsense, people resell non-free software all the time, eg instrument plugins
[04:25:59] <linext> that sort-of controls what it can do, but not making custom versions of it
[04:26:27] <damo22> but they cannot do so when they get a defective copy
[04:26:40] <damo22> that refuses to function
[04:26:59] <linext> i suppose old software is a good example
[04:27:13] <linext> it breaks because the developer doesn't support the new OS
[04:27:26] <linext> i tend to run those in an old VM

[05:56:08] <Kaiod> <anton> "<Kaio Duarte> <anton> "Kaio..." <- As student representation, I believe that all "real representation" makes itself available for dialogue. Personally, I count on the understanding and good reception by the student representatives. 
[05:56:09] <Kaiod> So let's count on that first. Try dialogue with whoever represents you, not only the student movement, but other local unions, academic directories, and other student/youth/educational organizations.
[05:56:09] <Kaiod> I also recommend that you talk directly to other students, so that your banner has collective power and you can leave the institution with no option but to accept the students' demand (being free software). If you already have students on your side, dialogue internally to organize a campaign in the institution, making students aware of user freedom.

[08:12:55] <Maximalist> is there something wrong with debian?
[08:12:59] <Maximalist> wanted to ask isf but went offline
[08:13:34] <euphoricallysane> I want to see a fsf endorsed, "Free the Routers" campaign 
[08:13:37] <DiffieHellman> Well not really aside from how Debian has two repo's full of temptation and a hard dependency on systemd.
[08:14:14] <damo22> euphoricallysane: openwrt already handles that
[08:14:20] <euphoricallysane> Like willy, his 6 core mips64, post alpha ass
[08:14:21] <euphoricallysane> I know
[08:14:27] <euphoricallysane> <3 openwrt
[08:14:56] <DiffieHellman> damo22: No it doesn't? While some OpenWRT releases are 100% free software, there's nonfree software in the repo and they don't even document the nonfree software that each device uses.
[08:15:01] <euphoricallysane> caveon, caveat, carapace, oh you mimu bug looking thing
[08:15:27] <euphoricallysane> binary blobs, friend :/
[08:15:31] <DiffieHellman> You need to use LibreCMC to be sure, but that has minimal device support due to lack of interest.

[08:16:16] <DiffieHellman> damo22: So your CPU is 32bit?
[08:16:24] <euphoricallysane> well, so long as you look at pr0n on linux
[08:16:28] <damo22> no i compromise
[08:16:47] <DiffieHellman> Not really, the device needs some firmware to operate, and unless such device is a tyrant, it's possible to replace proprietary firmware with free software firmware.
[08:17:08] <damo22> i wipe 95% of the management engine firmware and use coreboot for the rest of the firmware
[08:17:12] <DiffieHellman> But until someone does such difficult task, you're not going to have such functionality without the proprietary firmware.
[08:17:30] <euphoricallysane> How many arm based controllers, say, using ibm manyeyes, to show based on industry standards?
[08:17:46] <DiffieHellman> damo22: Well, AMD64 CPU's where the ME firmware can't be removed completely aren't that old.
[08:17:46] <euphoricallysane> just the past decade
[08:17:56] <euphoricallysane> I can uart a hdd from a decade ago
[08:18:16] <damo22> amd64?
[08:18:26] <damo22> ME is intel only
[08:18:35] <euphoricallysane> yup
[08:18:36] <DiffieHellman> damo22: x86 is a wide variety of 16 to 32-bit procerssors.
[08:18:43] <euphoricallysane> though, amd does have its shity

[08:19:06] <damo22> my cpu is from 2013 or so
[08:19:06] <DiffieHellman> AMD extended x86 to 64 bit to make AMD64. Intel then implemented AMD64. You may call it x86-64 if you prefer though.
[08:19:09] <damo22> thats old
[08:19:23] <euphoricallysane> Also, macbook keyboard layouts are just dickish
[08:19:47] <DiffieHellman> x64 has some minor overlap with other arch's, but generally that's a fine name.

[08:20:20] <euphoricallysane> yeh
[08:20:38] <damo22> id much prefer to be using a 9 or 10th gen intel cpu
[08:21:05] <damo22> it wastes less heat
[08:21:08] <euphoricallysane> I want to bring up another case, again https://www.probell.com/lexra/
[08:21:15] <DiffieHellman> Around 2008 is the best for intel when it comes to less backdoors
[08:21:48] <euphoricallysane> fx series had the cheap, just after
[08:21:55] <damo22> but im not going to use something i cant bring up the ram without a blob
[08:22:21] <Maximalist> do you guys only reccomend GNUpg for pgp key handling?
[08:22:34] <euphoricallysane> I was rocking a sempron 3100 oc to 2.5, overvolt 754 via wire, stable as a rock
[08:22:45] <damo22> :)
[08:22:59] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, it depends what actually brings up the RAM. If it's just training data, that's fine, as that's not software and such training data is not covered by copyright as that's the only way to do it.
[08:23:08] <damo22> i had a F2A85-M with trinity processor

[08:38:14] <DiffieHellman> That's a great example as to how patents stop progress; if someone makes a faster implementation of your arch that's careful not to infringe patents, you can still sue them anyway to stop them.

[08:57:01] <Andrew> The only few places where I think JS is good is for payment procing
[08:57:10] <Andrew> Because you don't want all your payment into on other people's servers

[19:02:20] <kompowiec2> but seriously, the plethora of package managers in linux causes an interoperability problem.
[19:04:00] <Maximalist> an exapmple being?
[19:04:35] <kompowiec2> Once, out of curiosity, I did a little distrowatch tour looking for distros that have their own package manager. Well, it seems that it comes out of 32, the only ones that really count are the RPM promoted by Red Hat, flatpak and DEB.
[19:05:23] <kompowiec2> https://i.imgur.com/NG9ARXZ.png
[19:05:47] <kompowiec2> Attempted to fix this problem back in 2004 under the name appimage, it is already built into the kernel and should now be supported by virtually every GNU / Linux distro, but unfortunately there is no marketing support like the flatpak from redhat and most devs don't care
[19:06:31] <kompowiec2> At the moment, the only solution to this problem is not to use the package manager at all and to manually compile the application from tarball sources. This is something slackware offers, i.e. it is closest to this idea, it has a package manager but no dependencies, so you can add any artifact, including RPM packages, and still manage the applications on your system efficiently. In systems that impose a specific packaging method on you, 
[19:06:31] <kompowiec2> the only thing left to do is to manually compile + GNU stow. This is IMO a good compromise between freedom and convenience.

[19:06:48] <qrpnxz> even for os that use the same packager you have to package different. Major formats are rpm, dpkg, pkgbuild, and emerge
[19:07:02] <kompowiec2> unless someone knows another idea
[19:07:11] <AwesomeAdam54321> kompowiec2: kompowiec2: the only thing left to do <- This design is basically the Guix package manager
[19:07:28] <AwesomeAdam54321> it compiles the program and keeps it in the store

[19:08:07] <kompowiec2> AwesomeAdam54321, unless someone tells you "I will agree to an interoperable package manager as long as it is the arch linux package manager"
[19:08:24] <isf> 19<Maximalist> isf: would you not reccomend using deb? why GNU instead? > Free distributions (or “distros”) of the GNU/Linux system only include and only propose free software. They reject nonfree applications, nonfree programming platforms, nonfree drivers, nonfree firmware “blobs,” and any other nonfree software and documentation. If they discover that by mistake some had been included, they remove it. 
[19:09:01] <isf> A nonfree program is an injustice. To distribute a nonfree program, to recommend a nonfree program to other people, or more generally steer them into a course that leads to using nonfree software, means leading them to give up their freedom. To be sure, leading people to use nonfree software is not the same as installing nonfree software in their computers, but we should not lead people in the wrong direction.
[19:09:13] <qrpnxz> "e only solution to this problem is not to use the package manager at all and to manually compile the application from tarball sources" Yeah, if you write software, you should be making install and uninstall from sources very easy. Not only for freedom purposes, for easy devolopment purposes, but also easy packaging purposes. If your package uses classic autotools, meson, cmake etc. packaging
[19:09:15] <qrpnxz>  is really trivial. The troublesome packages are the ones that are hard to build in the first place.
