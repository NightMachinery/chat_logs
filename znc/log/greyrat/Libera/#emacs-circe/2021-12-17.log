[22:42:23] <wasamasa> acdw: there's :cap-req in irc.el
[22:43:00] <acdw> i did see that, is there any way to get that into circe-network-options ? 
[22:43:17] <acdw> or would i need to call uh, irc-connect myself?
[22:49:05] <wasamasa> circe.el uses irc.el, so sure
[22:49:09] <wasamasa> you could adjust it
[22:49:12] <wasamasa> but why really?
[22:49:16] <wasamasa> what's the goal?
[22:49:54] <wasamasa> it smells like a workaround for something
[22:50:33] <acdw> irc.twitch.tv needs me to send a CAP REQ command
[22:50:56] <acdw> so if i can send '/quote CAP REQ :twitch.tv/membership' after joining, that works too
[22:51:16] <wasamasa> ok
[22:51:17] <acdw> just didn't see that in the options
[22:51:24] <wasamasa> I guess that's not some IRCv3 extension
[22:51:31] <acdw> i think it is? i honestly don't know
[22:51:56] <acdw> i can send it manually and it works, so just hoping for a auto thing
[22:53:11] <wasamasa> I mean, it doesn't seem official
[22:53:16] <wasamasa> looking at https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/capability-negotiation.html
[22:53:21] <wasamasa> yes, it's a vendor-specific extension
[22:53:25] <acdw> yeah
[22:53:33] <wasamasa> > Vendor-Specific capabilities should be submitted to the IRCv3 working group for consideration.
[22:53:52] <acdw> hmmm
[22:57:35] <wasamasa> anyway, the ircv3 story is barely implemented in circe
[22:57:39] <wasamasa> just enough for sasl
[22:59:13] <wasamasa> I think the easiest would be to send the quoted command after joining/connecting
