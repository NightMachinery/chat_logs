[01:09:55] <SysGhost> SponiX: I tested different UID's and GID's on the mounts option as mentioned earlier. It changes accordingly.
[01:10:12] <SysGhost> it overrides what's already there.
[01:10:41] <SponiX> SysGhost: so, on your system with 5.15.5 it does override. Odd, did you go out of your way to uninstall the user space ntfs tools (fuse) ?
[01:10:49] <neko2> ... hmm. this shadow.pacnew only contains a root entry, but still. that is concerning.
[01:11:03] <brocellous> neko2: /etc/shadow is owned by the filesystem package, so if the packaged file changes you're basically guaranteed a pacnew since /etc/shadow will be modified when you create your user

[01:18:50] <rawktucc> Hi there. just wanted some feedback. Setting up a 4x16TB server with static drives. I'm formatting 256M EFI Boot partition, 64GB / (root fs) partition (ZFS), remaining is data (ZFS). I want to mimic the 64GB root fs partition on all drives so that if one drive dies, I can restore a snapshot to one of the other 64GB drive partitions and continue working. Does this sound like a good idea, or is there something I can do with ZFS?

[01:29:04] <rawktucc> soooo i could have bit errors lol
[01:29:14] <rawktucc> but i wanted bit error protection
[01:29:15] <SysGhost> zfs has a few neat features, so do btrfs. but one can't really replace the other as the set of features are a bit different.
[01:30:08] <rawktucc> are there any comparison charts on what each has and doesnt have?
[01:30:17] <Hydragyrum> if you want parity raid, zfs is the only one with that
[01:30:32] <Hydragyrum> btrfs raid 5/6 aren't currently functional
[01:30:33] <SysGhost> zfs, given the right circumstances, can help save data when drives start to become a bit finicky. Assuming the server got some sweet ECC RAM
[01:30:44] <rawktucc> yes it does

[01:31:58] <rawktucc> how do i even find laptops with ecc ram

[01:32:37] <rawktucc> any amd?
[01:32:48] <topcat001> Precision's are beautifully made and tend to survive the most intense physical and mental (software) abuse, so our IT likes them.
[01:32:55] <SysGhost> AMD can do ECC even if their CPU's don't officially support it.
[01:32:57] <rawktucc> i need something slim and light
[01:33:08] <rawktucc> ah SysGhost good. so I'll look at the new ryzen thinkpads then
[01:33:15] <SysGhost> Intel only put ECC in their server grade lineup...
[01:33:21] <topcat001> My 15" Precision is quite slim.
[01:33:32] <rawktucc> thinkpad x13 with ryzen 5/7
[01:33:32] <topcat001> very handy
[01:34:01] <topcat001> If I were buying on my own I'd probably get a Framework with iGPU only.
[01:34:06] <rawktucc> man these are so expensive

[01:53:41] <SysGhost> I once told him: Depite it being updated the very same way, they're not truly identical. Due to the nature of how fs's works, bits aren't placend logically exactly the same between the two even if they do contain exactly the same stuff. He then looked at me with a very serious look. Turned back to the terminal and tested it... diffed the raw partition... and it showed slight differences... the OCD triggered. He sat there staring at the screen in 
[01:53:42] <SysGhost> disbelief.
[01:53:49] <rawktucc> I can rebuild initramfs/grub to point to another drive if one fails

[01:56:03] <SysGhost> rawktucc: that is what I like about gpt. I can set labels directly on partition no matter the file system they contain.

[01:59:53] <rawktucc> so what ill do now is: 512MB ESP, 64GB / EXT4 (each luks encrypted), remainder ZFS. 64GB will use rsnapshot or rsync to independently mirror changes to the other drive(s) 64GB partitions (which will stay unencrypted and unmounted when not in use)
[02:00:19] <topcat001> that's exactly what I'd do :D
[02:00:25] <rawktucc> so that way: changes are mirrored, partitions remain encrypted, and I wont boot to the wrong root fs

[02:03:44] <rawktucc> if you ping google's IP directly does the same thing happen
[02:03:46] <topcat001> rawktucc: That way you can easily switch to systemd-boot if you wanted.

[02:04:27] <rawktucc> honestly I'd prefer to have /boot in the encrypted FS but my understanding is the server boots as EFI
[02:04:35] <rawktucc> or I want to set EFI so I can use secure boot as well
[02:04:37] <rawktucc>  since it's a remote server

Every fuckin' time I copy something in a browser like firefox which ends up on the wayland clipboard, pastes in tmux (via shift+ins or middle mouse button) always paste what was in the clipboard before the copy the first time. The second time, it pastes what is currently in the clipboard. What the fuck do I do?

[05:55:37] <Namarrgon> how long is "too long" and how often do you reboot that it poses a problem?
[05:55:39] <jayray> does that weaken the hash is the big question
[05:55:55] <jayray> true.. 15 seconds is the current time at defaults
[05:56:07] <jayray> at 100 its just a second or two
[05:56:31] <jayray> on a box that isnt getting rebooted.. not an issue. but using this on a laptop that will likely see more frequent reboots

[15:09:02] <Antiz> Anyone here's using a standalone WM ?
[15:09:12] <thrice> !anyone
[15:09:12] <phrik> Quite possibly. Why do you ask?
[15:09:41] <Antiz> I have a odd behaviour with standalone WM
[15:09:49] <Antiz> So here's my problem :
[15:11:12] <Antiz> When I install a standalone WM and using a DM (lightdm in my case), my WM sets automatically on XGD_DESKTOP_SESSION, XDG_CURRENT_SESSION and DESKTOP_SESSION. Which means it is recognized as a DE by my system, not as a WM.
[15:11:32] <Antiz> Like neofetch puts it in the "DE" section for instance.
[15:12:28] <Antiz> If I use xinitrc instead of a DM (with startx) it doesn't sets itself anywhere. I mean, it starts and work without problem, but neofetch doesn't recognized it as a DE nor a WM

[18:30:15] <Namarrgon> replace the first argument with the variables you use in source=
