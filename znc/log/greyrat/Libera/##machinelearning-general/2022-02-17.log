[00:34:08] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: in all seriousness, he's doing like metamodelling of physics, like a model of every model in physics using networks/graphs and deep learning
[00:35:29] <mefistofeles> hodapp: fun fact, you can mathematically show that you or anyone is the center of the universe :P

[00:36:05] <shoky> who said it simplifies anything :p
[00:36:12] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: I'm guessing it doesn't, but ultimately just aiming for some kind of AI that gets new data and refines the model or create new ones, is my vague guess
[00:36:50] <dostoyevsky2> shoky: I thought the benefit of a new kind of quantum physics would be that it's easier to understand
[00:37:19] <shoky> dostoyevsky2: wolfram's main aim is to understand physics at its most fundamental level. that doesn't mean it's easier
[00:37:23] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: the data driven approach is kinda the opposite, though. One that you don't care about understanding, just nailing the results
[00:37:39] <mefistofeles> and that's like the main thing now in science
[00:38:02] <shoky> dostoyevsky2: things like quantum mechanics emerge from the fundamental hypergraph structures he's posited,  or so is the claim
[00:38:10] <mefistofeles> ↑
[00:39:41] <dostoyevsky2> so how is the hypergraph different from string theory (which is also a graph, no?)
[00:40:23] <shoky> string theory is not a graph no
[00:40:33] <shoky> the two have not much to do with eachother
[00:40:51] <mefistofeles> string theory is more of a mathematical framework, yeah
[00:40:52] <shoky> string theory says that particles are really strings, basically :p
[00:41:29] <mefistofeles> but in a sense is similar, we just abstract things to some complex mathematical object (such a graph or a string)
[00:41:46] <mefistofeles> *such as

[01:47:18] <hodapp> it's a bit strange to see that presented as a dichotomy, as if string theory is "mathematics alone" and devoid of computation
[01:51:03] <hodapp> if and when the work progresses to a falsifiable theory, it might start to interest me more than something like string theory does
[01:51:37] <brand0> wolfram sees computaion as the next generation of representational power
[01:52:08] <brand0> and that we've reached the limit with pure mathematics when applied to unifying the theories of physics
[01:52:35] <brand0> he doesn't rule out computation leading to some discovery of some new equations though
[01:54:06] <hodapp> what he's doing is pure mathematics, which more or less subsumes computation. in his prior work, he showed quite a disdain for the *applied* mathematics of physics

[02:03:32] <hodapp> well, that probably depends a bit on the course
[02:03:44] <hodapp> which one is it? or have you chosen yet?
[02:03:57] <Klinda> https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2021
[02:03:58] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  GitHub - erodola/DLAI-s2-2021: Teaching material for the course of Deep Learning and Applied AI, 2nd semester 2021, Sapienza University of Rome
[02:03:58] <Klinda> this
[02:04:24] <hodapp> probably just have to dive in and see
[02:04:35] <Klinda> no book required
[02:04:37] <Klinda> that scares me ahaha
[02:05:12] <hodapp> that's normal for deep learning; there just aren't textbooks that are up-to-date enough
[02:05:27] <Klinda> Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.
[02:06:29] <hodapp> At the moment, that's the best way to do things, TBH. Curated papers/articles are often the best up-to-date reference, and individual book chapters can be pretty good as background
[02:06:42] <hodapp> e.g. something from Mitchell's text, or Bishop's (PRML)
[02:07:39] <Klinda> I am scared about the math involved on reddit they advise me to see this https://www.3blue1brown.com/
[02:07:40] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  3Blue1Brown
[02:08:01] <hodapp> do you have much linear algebra experience?
[02:08:11] <hodapp> and what about calculus?
[02:08:27] <Klinda> .... I did it 6 years ago and not well too or remember something
[02:08:31] <dostoyevsky2> Klinda: do you hang out in #math here?
[02:08:51] <dostoyevsky2> ##math even
[02:09:34] <Klinda> on math they said like start from high school, that is not possibile to do
[02:09:38] <Klinda> I need like a shortcut
[02:10:16] <Klinda> I mean how I am supossed to be a pro on math and study for other subjects too, no time right?
[02:10:20] <hodapp> linear algebra and calculus are the most critical for deep learning, but full courses in those probably cover a lot of things that aren't as relevant
[02:11:05] <Klinda> I can't take a full course on these topics and do a deep learning too, why someone didn't do like some video lesson about the math involved to ml
[02:11:26] <hodapp> but being able to understand matrix multiplication, and have some intuition around when they talk about things like "projections", work with vectors, or know about how/why dot products work, is necessary for a lot of the implementation
[02:13:16] <Klinda> I will start seeing on that page that talk about algebra and calculus
[02:13:23] <Klinda> maybe it helps me
[02:13:28] <brand0> Klinda: the "deep learning" book is pretty good as an introductory material, as long as you're willing to learn any missing gaps

[02:14:30] <brand0> of course, but it's a good place to start
[02:14:34] <hodapp> yes
[02:14:35] <brand0> yes Klinda
[02:14:47] <dostoyevsky2> Klinda: yeah, you can read it for free online too...
[02:14:53] <brand0> with machine learning you should be prepared to use a variety of sources
[02:15:01] <hodapp> feel free to ask questions here on math you encounter too
[02:15:02] <brand0> no one source alone is sufficient
[02:15:24] <hodapp> sometimes in papers on machine learning their use of notation is....... creative
[02:15:43] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: Math is prose... like a poem
[02:15:45] <brand0> the beauty of mathematics
[02:15:52] <brand0> it's all made up
[02:16:16] <hodapp> it isn't that it's made-up, it's just that ML papers sometimes take considerable liberties with the math
[02:16:36] <hodapp> and with not being very standard in their notation, even within a single paper
[02:18:43] <Klinda> how relevant is math for machine learning when you are at work?
[02:18:56] <Klinda> (if you decide to make that path)
[02:19:23] <hodapp> well... depends on your work
[02:20:21] <Klinda> on youtube is very funny when they say like oh wow I did 99% accuracy
[02:20:22] <Klinda> wow!
[02:20:27] <hodapp> in mine: very relevant, as I regularly have to debug implementations, or implement based on a paper, and analyze what's going on
[02:20:31] <Klinda> I guess it's not like that, the true work...
[02:20:51] <hodapp> for someone who isn't doing nearly as much custom work, perhaps a bit less necessary
[02:21:53] <Klinda> so you are in good in math for sure, how did you learn it?
[02:22:06] <brand0> Klinda: varies from not relevant at all to very relevant sometimes :P
[02:22:19] <Klinda> when I read a paper I don't really understand anything

[02:23:00] <mefistofeles> really? all?
