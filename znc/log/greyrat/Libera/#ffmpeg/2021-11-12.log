[00:43:05] <megabytesofrem> why does my stream show a black screen when i try and stream using x11grab to vlc?
[00:43:11] <megabytesofrem> ffmpeg -f x11grab -i :0.0+0,0 -framerate 30 -vcodec libx264 -preset veryfast -bufsize 4000k -maxrate 4000k \ -probesize 64M \ -pix_fmt yuv420p -f mpegts "udp://myip:1234" command im using
[00:43:35] <megabytesofrem> i can conenct fine, but it just shows a black screen - any help would b welcome :)
[00:46:36] <JEEB> check the pixel format for the output that you get by default, and whether you are utilizing hw decoding in vlc
[00:46:46] <JEEB> since hardware decoding only supports 4:2:0
[00:46:54] <JEEB> while that might be 4:4:4
[00:47:20] <megabytesofrem> hmm, what should i do
[00:47:23] <megabytesofrem> and how would i check that
[00:47:37] <megabytesofrem> im new to ffmpeg, just wanna setup a server so i can screen share on linux
[00:48:00] <JEEB> this is why people request logs, if possible with at least -v verbose and not just the command :P utilize a pastebin site of your choice and post the logs with command - then link here
[00:48:15] <megabytesofrem> sure, lemme run it again
[00:48:27] <megabytesofrem> u want me to put -v?
[00:48:43] <JEEB> `-v verbose`
[00:48:53] <JEEB> since verbose is an argument for the v option (verbosity)
[00:49:09] <JEEB> it's the last level which isn't spammy
[00:49:12] <JEEB> but still adds a bit
[00:49:15] <JEEB> compared to default
[00:50:01] <megabytesofrem> it says my private internal ip
[00:50:07] <megabytesofrem> should i redact that or is it safe to send?
[00:51:40] <JEEB> if it's private I don't think anyone'll care, but you can redact that if you want, it's a small detail which (most likely) is not affecting it
[00:51:50] <megabytesofrem> ij
[00:51:55] <megabytesofrem> lemme upload to pastebin

[00:52:57] <JEEB> thanks
[00:53:16] <JEEB> ah yes
[00:53:22] <JEEB> yuv420p you are setting with -pix_fmt
[00:53:25] <JEEB> that is why it ends up 4:2:0
[00:53:29] <JEEB> alright, something

[00:55:43] <JEEB> also look at the messages log in vlc if possible
[00:56:20] <JEEB> in a case like this I'd probably preferably go for UDP multicast instead of to a specific IP, since the other side already has to be listening I think for this one to work?
[00:56:36] <JEEB> I don't recall how unicast UDP listening/writing worked :D
[00:56:53] <megabytesofrem> could u explain? im just trying to set smth up so a friend  can view my screen using ffmpeg
[00:57:07] <megabytesofrem> then when i figure out how it works ill write a shell script or smth
[00:57:33] <megabytesofrem> also i disabled hw decoding and now vlc just does the bar bouncing thing infinitely
[00:57:36] <megabytesofrem> it never connects
[00:58:08] <JEEB> yea, that should not affect it :D
[00:58:18] <megabytesofrem> hmm
[00:58:24] <JEEB> there's a messaging thing in vlc, where you can bump the verbosity. it's its own window

[00:58:31] <JEEB> if you are OK with broadcasting to your LAN
[00:58:36] <JEEB> I would probably recommend multicast
[00:58:40] <megabytesofrem> how would i stream my desktop to a port on my network
[00:58:48] <megabytesofrem> i dont wanna broadcast it 2 everyone bc i live w/ 4 ppl
[00:59:04] <megabytesofrem> but i just want it on a port that i can control
[00:59:17] <JEEB> alright, so my first test would be on localhost, and multicast - if possible
[00:59:28] <megabytesofrem> im trying this on localhost
[00:59:31] <megabytesofrem> it d oesnt work
[00:59:31] <JEEB> ok
[00:59:45] <JEEB> alright then
[00:59:51] <JEEB> let's start with localhost multicast first then
[01:00:06] <JEEB> since you were already doing MPEG-TS over UDP
[01:00:07] <megabytesofrem> isnt multicast streaming 2 everyone in my local network
[01:00:11] <megabytesofrem> which i dont rlly want
[01:00:23] <JEEB> that's why my first word in that was localhost
[01:00:35] <JEEB> after the input and before output set -localaddr 127.0.0.1
[01:00:40] <megabytesofrem> could u explain what localhost multicast is?
[01:00:52] <JEEB> broadcasting into 127.0.0.1 network interface :P
[01:01:01] <megabytesofrem> gotcha
[01:01:04] <megabytesofrem> so what do i set?
[01:01:17] <JEEB> the first bit I noted, setting localaddr for the UDP output
[01:01:19] <JEEB> second
[01:01:30] *** Joins: Jan\ (~kvirc@104.204.200.116)
[01:01:32] <JEEB> set udp:// IP to something multicast port|IP
[01:01:38] <JEEB> usually 239.xx or so
[01:01:52] <JEEB> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address
[01:02:05] <megabytesofrem> ok this is just confusing me now
[01:02:14] <megabytesofrem> so i set localaddr to 127.0.0.1 and then what
[01:02:47] <JEEB> that makes it pick that network interface. and then since you will be shouting multicast into that interface, you set that by setting a multicast UDP address and port
[01:02:59] <JEEB> 239.123.123.1:1337 for example
[01:03:11] <megabytesofrem> so how do i find my multicast port thing
[01:03:26] <JEEB> you are setting it since you are the one starting the stream
[01:03:34] <JEEB> it is not a unicast address
[01:04:00] <megabytesofrem> but why cant it just output to a local address like i want
[01:04:07] <megabytesofrem> why does it need to be a multicast local address
[01:04:07] <JEEB> it will
[01:04:18] <JEEB> ok, so you want to ask why multicast?
[01:04:21] <megabytesofrem> yeah
[01:04:36] <JEEB> because it's simpler to get started with since it doesn't have as many shenanigans
[01:04:49] <JEEB> it's not a server kind of thing, think of ffmpeg then shouting into 127.0.0.1
[01:05:03] <JEEB> and the shout's identifier is that UDP address and port
[01:05:25] <megabytesofrem> but this wont broadcast it for everyone on my network right?
[01:05:27] <megabytesofrem> just localhost
[01:05:43] <JEEB> that is what the localaddr is for
[01:05:50] <JEEB> "pick that interface for the shouting"
[01:05:57] <JEEB> you can check with `sudo netstat -lpn` in another terminmal if you do not trust it
[01:06:29] <JEEB> anyways what I wanted to write
[01:06:44] <megabytesofrem> i see
[01:06:48] <JEEB> then in another terminal do `ffprobe -v verbose -localaddr 127.0.0.1 -i udp://MULTICAST_IP:PORT`
[01:07:00] <JEEB> that should show that your stream is actually happening
[01:07:07] <JEEB> by connecting to it
[01:07:21] <megabytesofrem> ok lemme try the localaddr stuff
[01:07:58] <JEEB> and in case of ffprobe it's for input, since by default if you try to read or write UDP for some reason the local interface is not gonna get picked ;)
[01:08:11] <JEEB> anyways, what is your goal
[01:08:15] <megabytesofrem> so what do i put for -f mpegts
[01:08:27] <megabytesofrem> to get a small shitty script that can stream screen to a server locally
[01:08:38] <JEEB> what are your clients going to be?
[01:08:46] <megabytesofrem> vlc
[01:08:52] <JEEB> ok, so no web browsers etc?

[01:09:03] <megabytesofrem> we were just planning on vlc for now
[01:09:06] <JEEB> ok
[01:09:34] <JEEB> then let's start with this, and if you want to set up something like nginx and PUT-post HLS/DASH at it, that would probably work too
[01:09:36] <megabytesofrem> so like port 6969 would have a video stream of whtever were doing

[01:12:29] <JEEB> anyways, you had UDP unicast there so I started helping you with that. and doing localhost multicast is a good way to get started if you're going to be doing UDP
[01:12:36] <megabytesofrem> hmm
[01:12:38] <JEEB> also there are applications that can share multicast over HTTP etc
[01:12:40] <megabytesofrem> whats my other options
[01:12:45] <JEEB> there's a *lot*
[01:12:47] <megabytesofrem> as far as screen streaming
[01:12:53] <megabytesofrem> list t hem in order of shit to good
[01:12:54] <JEEB> well you are video streaming
[01:13:05] <JEEB> and here you get to the problem of use cases
[01:13:13] <JEEB> you cannot have a single left-to-right list
[01:13:27] <JEEB> since UDP multicast f.ex. will not work over internets
[01:13:29] <megabytesofrem> idc about audio necesarily
[01:13:39] <JEEB> nor will you play that on an iphone while outside
[01:13:46] <JEEB> so it really depends on what you are planning to do with it :P
[01:13:58] <JEEB> I
[01:14:08] <megabytesofrem> pc only, and has to support us being not on local network
[01:14:12] <megabytesofrem> despite living 5 mins apart
[01:14:14] <JEEB> ok
[01:14:38] <JEEB> if it's PC only then you can remove at least one annoying thing from the mix
[01:14:49] <JEEB> those file-based things
[01:14:57] <megabytesofrem> wym
[01:15:34] <JEEB> anyways, I would then probably do it like this: udp multicast to localhost, then a multicast-to-HTTP server giving the other side a possibility to just connect to http://IP:port and play
[01:15:49] <megabytesofrem> thing is
[01:15:50] <JEEB> with vlc or some other player
[01:15:56] <megabytesofrem> it has to work so either of us can stream it
[01:16:00] <megabytesofrem> so be unidirectional
[01:16:47] <megabytesofrem> sorry bidirectional*
[01:17:13] <JEEB> well you'd anyways need port forwarding on both sides if both are going to be publishers, or some other way of sharing connectivity
[01:17:26] <JEEB> that, or you publish to an external thing :P
[01:17:26] <megabytesofrem> how does discord do it
[01:18:13] <JEEB> I will guess they route the traffic through a central server, and then send it to the people on the meeting
[01:18:24] <JEEB> you could do peer-to-peer with webrtc or so
[01:18:33] <JEEB> you still need a middleman server that says where to connect to, though
[01:18:46] <JEEB> and then in that case if it's peer-to-peer you need a port open from both sides
[01:19:21] <JEEB> I do actually wonder if it's enough for you to just utilize a jitsi instance?
[01:19:40] <JEEB> jitsi being a webrtc audio/video comms thing, and you can do screen sharing through the browser f.ex.
[01:19:56] <JEEB> which will be pretty much teh same as an end result as f.ex. discord
[01:29:06] <megabytesofrem> we're just gonna go w/ hls since it doesnt look that hard to setup

[01:44:35] <JEEB> under the git repo there's doc/examples. see the transcode* examples since they contain stuff like reading the input, opening a decoder and then getting AVFrames out
[01:45:01] <JEEB> other good protip I have is site:ffmpeg.org doxygen trunk KEYWORD
[01:45:08] <JEEB> for the search engine you prefer
[01:45:31] <JEEB> then one of the best pages in the doxy is https://lists.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__lavc__encdec.html
[01:45:40] <JEEB> which explains how the current dec/enc API works
[01:46:39] <JEEB> in the examples, see https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/master/doc/examples f.ex. , ctrl+F "transco"
[01:47:02] <JEEB> all the decode etc specific examples are very limited to specifically that, which you often do not want
[01:47:22] <JEEB> since generally you want to take an input, give it to libavformat, which will then give you AVPackets back
[01:47:30] <JEEB> usually attached to an AVStream index
[01:47:43] *** Joins: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat)
[01:47:47] <JEEB> then you initiate a decoder for that AVStreams's AVCodec
[01:48:04] <JEEB> the transcoding examples tend to go through that whole thing, rather than just a small bit of the API
[01:48:19] <JEEB> then you can leave out of course stuff like encoding the decoded audio again :)

[03:34:03] <aphysically> wow I found a second mkv file that needed adjusting the probe depth/size in order to read correctly enough to encode
[03:34:17] <aphysically> I wonder if there was a change recently that affected the ability to autodetect this
[03:35:03] <aphysically> nope, 4.4.1 fails the same way
[03:35:22] <aphysically> hmmm I kinda just want to deep probe everything
[03:36:38] <aphysically> (this was a file that couldn't detect the start_time for the audio stream unless the probisze/depth was adjusted)
[03:37:15] <aphysically> and since srt/mpegts need the audio video presynced you need to do a presync past the start_time to use mpegts and not get a/v sync issues
[03:37:22] <aphysically> which doesn't work if it doesn't detect the correct start_time :P
[03:37:49] <aphysically> JEEB: that issue the other day was actually that a .mkv needed probed more deeply too
[03:38:11] <aphysically> although in that case it was just some sample rate metadata or whatever that it didn't get
[03:39:42] <aphysically> I'm still a bit surprised that .mkv has this problem, I thought the sort of probe size issue was going to be limited to more exotic formats
[03:40:51] <aphysically> right now I have probesize/analyzeduration at 100M both I'm not sure what's reasonable

[11:47:28] <sqz1> afaik you are not a moderator here, and if you don't like answers to your questions you might be the one rethinking your questions.
[11:48:26] <JEEB> with ffmpeg.c you either have its automatic stream mapping happen, or you do all maps manually with map. that's it.
[11:48:46] <JEEB> -map 0:a:3 will pick f.ex. the fourth (3th) audio stream :P
[11:48:50] <JEEB> from first input

[15:18:23] <luc4> BtbN: It seems av_parser_init returns nullptr. Maybe because there is no parser for AV_CODEC_ID_RAWVIDEO?
[15:18:31] <JEEB> yes

[15:21:42] <luc4> JEEB: read this raw video stream into my application. My app won’t handle yuva420p, so I was hoping libavcodec could convert for me into egba
[15:21:59] <luc4> *rgba
[15:22:04] <JEEB> libavcodec only decodes, it doesn't convert
[15:22:12] <BtbN> Are you sure you aren't JUST looking for swscale?
[15:22:21] <JEEB> utilize libavfilter or libswscale for scaling and color space conversions
[15:22:27] <JEEB> both have AVFrame APIs now
[15:22:43] <JEEB> but can you please explain why you dumped the raw YUVA into a file?
[15:22:43] <JEEB> :D
[15:23:05] <JEEB> you are clearly trying to do something but you've for some reason taken some intermediate steps
[15:23:39] <luc4> JEEB: ok, so I have to handle the frames myself, pass it to a converter and then I’ll have the rgba buffer
[15:23:41] <JEEB> what is the end result you want to have?
[15:24:06] <luc4> JEEB: read this raw stream into rgba buffers
[15:24:30] <luc4> JEEB: I know I can do it some other way, I just thought ffmpeg libs could do some work for me
[15:24:56] <JEEB> but is your input in the end really going to be raw yuva buffer that is dumped from ffmpeg.c or whatever?
[15:25:13] <JEEB> like that sounds really weird
[15:25:26] <luc4> JEEB: yes, the stream will be raw yuva420p
[15:25:28] <JEEB> why did you not convert to RGBA at that point
[15:25:41] <JEEB> luc4: ok, so where does your YUVA come from?
[15:25:46] <JEEB> you just said you converted it with ffmpeg.c
[15:25:49] <luc4> JEEB: too large in RGBA
[15:26:06] <JEEB> I would recommend piping it via NUT or something
[15:26:15] <luc4> JEEB: yes, stream comes from ffmpeg, after filtering and postprocessing
[15:26:17] <JEEB> standard input as input om nom nom
[15:26:56] <luc4> JEEB: my input is a file
[15:26:57] <JEEB> NUT because you most likely want some sort of timestamps
[15:27:20] <JEEB> luc4: are you doing seeking or A-to-B kind of stuff?
[15:27:23] <luc4> JEEB: no, framerate is fixed and known
[15:27:43] <JEEB> `ffmpeg STUFF - | your-application -i -`
[15:27:50] <luc4> JEEB: frames will be handled inside the application "manually”
[15:27:59] <JEEB> is there something stopping you from doing this?
[15:28:04] <JEEB> like seeking etc
[15:28:13] <JEEB> this way you could leave the RGBA conversion to ffmpeg.c
[15:28:14] <luc4> JEEB: I’ll have more input
[15:28:45] <luc4> I mean more input files
[15:28:51] <JEEB> anyways, look at the transcoding example instead of that limited one
[15:29:05] <JEEB> utilize rawdec demuxer and set your resolution, pix_fmt etc
[15:29:29] <JEEB> then you can get packets from that and pass them onto more or less no-op rawvideo decoder
[15:29:30] <luc4> JEEB: https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/transcoding_8c_source.html?
[15:29:32] <JEEB> then you get AVFrames
[15:29:34] <JEEB> yes
[15:29:42] <JEEB> you can ignore the encoding bits
[15:29:45] <luc4> perfect, thanks!
[15:29:46] <JEEB> if you do not encode
[15:30:04] <luc4> I’ll encode, but after processing inside my app
[15:30:16] <JEEB> then when you get to the AVFrames you can pass those either to swscale's AVFrame API or libavfilter with scale filter
[15:30:23] <JEEB> and that way you can convert to RGB
[15:30:28] <luc4> perfect thanks
[15:32:02] <luc4> JEEB: don’t want to bother you, but the reason why I need raw streams are that I need to handle transparent videos in GPU. Do you know if there is any way to have alpha channel in the videos with nvidia maybe? I’m unsure about hevc…
[15:32:46] <JEEB> also try writing rawvideo yuva420p into nut
[15:33:02] <JEEB> even if you don't need frame rate, if ffprobe can tell you the frame size and pix_fmt
[15:33:14] <JEEB> you don't then need to set them when opening the data
[15:33:26] <JEEB> less work :P
[15:33:37] <luc4> JEEB: thanks
[15:34:40] <JEEB> another example would have been y4m, but the writer only supports 4:4:4 with alpha :)
[15:35:01] <JEEB> that is a much simpler format (just header plus data), but alas.
[15:35:44] <luc4> JEEB: unfortuantely handling transparent videos is pretty difficult
[15:36:34] <luc4> JEEB: I can’t find a place where the format yuva420p is described, do you happen to know one?
[15:37:48] <luc4> I also tried to handle this with cuda filters, but no luck. Those do not seem to handle the alpha channel either
[15:40:05] <JEEB> it's planar, so separate pointers for each plane
[15:40:24] <JEEB> so you get all Y first, then all Cb and then all Cr
[15:40:30] <JEEB> and finally A

[15:43:31] <volgar1x> and doesn't try to read more blocks

[21:09:25] <ksu> hi, i would like to record a radio stream
[21:09:32] <ksu> i can do that with -c copy output.adts
[21:09:45] <BtbN> If the input is adts, sure
[21:09:46] <ksu> but the resulting file does not contain icy metadata
[21:10:09] <ksu> can i record it, too, somehow?
[21:10:23] <BtbN> Yeah, passing through metadats is not exactly well supported and might not work at all
[21:11:47] <furq> it's not supported at all by ffmpeg itself
[21:12:05] <furq> icy metadata is transmitted out of band
[21:12:29] <furq> the demuxer can receive it but you'd have to write your own api client to do anything with it
[21:15:31] <ksu> is pyav a suitable api for this?
[21:15:50] <furq> no idea
[21:16:07] <furq> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#http
[21:16:14] <furq> the icy stuff in there is what you need access to
[21:17:16] <ksu> ok, thank you, i will try to investigate
