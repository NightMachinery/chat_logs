[00:30:53] <NickV> Hi, i'm trying to make a regular expression that removes any word (separated from whitespaces) that has inbetween punctuation except from a single apostrophe, if there are more than one apostrophes it should be removed. The text after the example should look like this "hello what's up" https://regex101.com/r/RoIrQY/1 (java 8 ) Thanks allot!

[01:27:45] <mysticspiral[m]> dont remove the + after the ?
[01:27:49] <mysticspiral[m]> its important

[01:29:18] <NickV> why do i need the '+'
[01:32:25] <mysticspiral[m]> first i need to check something

[01:38:03] <NickV> what was the difference?

[01:38:25] *** Quits: re101-bobcat-68 (~re101-bob@p5b33d19a.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:38:33] <mysticspiral[m]> lets work through how the regex actually works
[01:38:45] <NickV> that would be awesome man if  you have the time
[01:39:13] <mysticspiral[m]> this is a perl version of the regex, so we can use the debugger to visualize
[01:39:14] <mysticspiral[m]> https://regex101.com/r/RoIrQY/6/debugger
[01:39:32] <NickV> oh i see
[01:41:03] <NickV> i don;t understand what this means (?:'[a-zA-Z]*)
[01:41:21] <NickV> with the ?+
[01:42:24] <mysticspiral[m]> it makes the quantifier possessive
[01:42:36] <mysticspiral[m]> remove the + and see what happens
[01:43:07] <NickV> oh
[01:43:09] <NickV> it also removes
[01:43:18] <NickV> the "what's" ?
[01:43:26] <mysticspiral[m]> yes
[01:44:04] <NickV> so when i put this ?+ infront it means at least once?
[01:44:11] <mysticspiral[m]> first consider how the regex would be without (?:'[a-zA-Z]*)?+
[01:44:22] <mysticspiral[m]> https://regex101.com/r/RoIrQY/7
[01:44:59] <NickV> hmm it matches the extra "what's"
[01:45:27] <NickV> and then by adding this  (?:'[a-zA-Z]*)?+ you say only if exactly one apostrophe inside, ignore?
[01:45:51] <NickV> ignore -> don't match *
[01:46:02] <mysticspiral[m]> do you understand the regex without the part completely already?
[01:46:22] <NickV> nope ^^
[01:46:51] <mysticspiral[m]> first understand it, then we can proceed to the other part
[01:47:09] <NickV> i don't understand the last part
[01:47:17] <NickV> \p{Punct}]*[a-zA-Z]
[01:47:33] <NickV> why does this work, what if there are more than one characters after the punctuation?
[01:47:53] <mysticspiral[m]> you overlooked something
[01:47:56] <mysticspiral[m]> this is the term:
[01:48:00] <mysticspiral[m]> [a-zA-Z\p{P}]*
[01:48:30] <NickV> oooh
[01:48:32] <mysticspiral[m]> it means any letter or punctiuation
[01:48:34] <NickV> i seee
[01:50:25] <mysticspiral[m]> so the whole thing basically works like this: find any punctiuation within the word then match the rest of the word as well
[01:50:28] *** Joins: oscurochu (~oscurochu@37.120.215.100)
[01:51:02] <NickV> oh ! but the middle one says if there is an apostrophe inbetween two words and no more then ignore the match up to next word boundary?
[01:55:47] <mysticspiral[m]> first of all consider this: ? mean 0 or 1 times. so basically anything that you add now to the regex with an ? means it can only find more matches but not less. why? because it could always choose to ignore it by saying it matches 0 times

[01:57:28] <NickV> to say exact one time?
[01:57:41] <mysticspiral[m]> no
[01:57:54] <re101-bobcat-68> sorry i have to ask again ... it does not work i have to extract the value from the whole json string :-(
[01:58:12] <re101-bobcat-68> https://regex101.com/r/xmOic6/1
[01:58:29] <mysticspiral[m]> exactly one time would be {1}

[01:58:54] <re101-bobcat-68> position 13 in the nrg array

[02:12:38] <mysticspiral[m]> \d?+.. vs \d?.. on 12
[02:12:55] <mysticspiral[m]> first one doesnt match, second matches 12
[02:13:12] <NickV> oh i get  it
[02:13:24] <NickV> because first one says there must be exactly zero or one
[02:13:30] <NickV> if > 1
[02:13:39] <NickV> then it wont capture
[02:14:16] <mysticspiral[m]> \d? and \d?+ both say exactly zero or one
[02:14:21] <NickV> it continuously tries to match
[02:14:29] <NickV> with every character
[02:14:41] <NickV> ?
[02:15:53] <mysticspiral[m]> \d?.. works like this: it matches 1 with \d?, then 2 with . then notices there is no character left for the third .
[02:17:35] <mysticspiral[m]> then it remembers that the \d was optional, goes back and retries without it and succeeds
[02:18:12] <mysticspiral[m]> \d?+ means that if it matches then this is final, backtracking not allowed
[02:18:40] <NickV> ooh
[02:18:51] <NickV> so the \d?.. backtracks
[02:18:57] <NickV> while the \d?+ doesn't
[02:18:59] <mysticspiral[m]> yes

[03:44:38] <re101-pug-25> I have this rule (_obfuscated)(v\d+\.\d+\.\d+) but the input should contain both
[03:45:09] <re101-pug-25> How can I apply AND operator for this groups
[03:47:15] <mysticspiral[m]> the input can be _obfuscated or something like v123.456.789 and you want to match both options?
[03:48:47] <re101-pug-25> mysticspiral[m] not OR. The input should contains _obfuscated  and v123.456.789
[03:49:25] <re101-pug-25> Yes I want to match bot
[03:49:32] <re101-pug-25> both*
[03:50:08] <mysticspiral[m]> so input string would be for example this?
[03:50:14] <mysticspiral[m]> _obfuscatedv123.456.789
[03:50:29] <mysticspiral[m]> how would an input string example look like?
[03:53:44] <mysticspiral[m]> (_obfuscated).*(v\d+.\d+.\d+) would make sure that both captures exist in the input string, but only if obfuscated comes first
[04:06:31] <re101-pug-25> Ohh man I am stupid :D
[04:07:19] <re101-pug-25> v123.456.789_obfuscated input is like this I put reverse it and it worked because obfuscated should be second match
[04:07:31] <re101-pug-25> Thnx man :D
[04:08:04] <mysticspiral[m]> ok
[04:14:53] <re101-gecko-17> Thanks for the workaround!

[04:25:08] <vlad_> Hello. I have a simple regexp which looks like this: 's/user_pref(\"browser.startup.page\",.*);/user_pref(\"browser.startup.page\", 3)' - I don't like that I repeat myself with 'browser.startup.page' in the replace-with part. Any hints how to optimize this particular example? Thank you in advance.

[18:48:12] <arash> Hello, is there any better regex for https://regex101.com/r/Ln15VI/1 to capture 26012460-73aa-11ec-9d2e-070a7a42c1c5 ?!
[18:49:38] *** Joins: arash_ (uid510918@id-510918.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[18:50:35] <mysticspiral[m]> how about this? https://regex101.com/r/Ln15VI/2
[18:50:58] <mysticspiral[m]> matches 36 occurrences of hexadecimals/dashes 
[18:53:40] <arash> thank you. but I don't like it, what if the pattern changes?! I think mine is better!
[18:55:27] <mysticspiral[m]> if you want it to match your way use this https://regex101.com/r/Ln15VI/3
[18:56:50] <arash> thank you. that is exactly what i needed. I didn't know anything about \K
[18:57:21] <mysticspiral[m]> Sets the given position in the regex as the new start of the match. Nothing preceding \K will be returned as part of the full match.
[18:57:39] <arash> nice :)
[18:58:22] <mysticspiral[m]> \K is a nice thing that is annoying to not have
[18:59:13] <mysticspiral[m]> especially with engines that dont support non-fixed width lookbehinds as well
[19:19:29] <Timvde> arash: well, you didn't give enough information to answer "what if the pattern changes"
[19:19:47] <Timvde> That is clearly a uuid, they have a strict format
[19:19:53] <Timvde> So matching a uuid seems reasonable
[19:20:33] <Timvde> So what is it that you want to match? "Everything in the last part of the URL" or "a uuid"?
[19:21:47] <mysticspiral[m]> yup =)
[19:22:15] <Timvde> In the first case, this is a shorter/more readable version that doesn't match the URL but only the last part: https://regex101.com/r/Ln15VI/4
[19:22:26] <Timvde> The \K solution also works in PCRE, but not in JS for example
[19:22:59] <Timvde> And if you use PCRE, I'd opt to add a (*SKIP) to make it more efficient: https://regex101.com/r/Ln15VI/5
[19:23:37] <Timvde> (depending on the input size though, if performance is not a concern at all, this may confuse potential readers for no real reason)
