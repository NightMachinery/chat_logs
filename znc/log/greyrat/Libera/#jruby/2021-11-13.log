[00:46:28] <mattpatt[m]> I have a version of the snapshot publish task that may or may not work, and won't run until everything passes. GHA's setup-java action claims to configure the settings.xml stuff correctly, so it's pretty simple. I'm trying it as a reusable workflow and one that can be manually triggered so we can test it (unfortunately, only once that workflow file is on master)
[01:24:23] <mattpatt[m]> I may have also got the Sequel stuff running properly
[01:25:53] <mattpatt[m]> Yup, Sequel passed.
[01:27:50] <mattpatt[m]> Ignoring the almost certain non-workiness of the snapshot publish workflow, I think that's all the Travis jobs running in GHA
[01:29:41] <mattpatt[m]> Once you're happy that you're only seeing real failures and not environmental stuff I'll squash the PR commits down (It'll still need to be two commits because of the need to use a full SHA in the reusable workflow invocation).
[03:29:04] <byteit101[m]> Is there a way to link a java field and an @ivar?
[04:05:46] <headius> Not currently...there's not really any abstraction for storing Ivar's as specific fields
[04:05:59] <headius> We do it for Ruby classes but the fields are generated
[04:18:06] <byteit101[m]> Yes, I was remembering the generated classes. How hard would it be for (manually configured?) reified classes?
[05:09:00] <headius> It's doable
