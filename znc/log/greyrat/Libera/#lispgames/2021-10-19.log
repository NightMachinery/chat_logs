[00:22:39] <dto> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lovEHj0o/Screenshot%20at%202021-10-18%2016-51-57.png
[00:24:20] <borodust> why not, everything is possible and possibilities are endless ;p
[00:24:24] <borodust> with lisp
[00:24:40] <dto> hmm.
[00:25:44] <dto> i dunno for the jam i should prob stick to something simpler like a shooter
[00:26:30] <dto> how ru borodust ?
[00:27:02] <borodust> still good, going through with the jam)
[00:27:32] <technomancy> "JRPG-tetris" O_O
[00:31:34] <dto> yeah technomancy!
[00:31:48] <dto> https://gitlab.com/dto/wizl0rd
[00:31:55] <dto> here's a design doc if u want to see. i used opengameart. 
[00:31:58] <technomancy> that's wild
[00:32:58] <dto> :)
[00:36:41] <dto> its too complicated for the jam, though. i wanna shoot thingies
[00:39:05] <technomancy> I'm doing something tetrisy but it doesn't have character classes or mana points or anything like that
[00:39:59] <technomancy> mine's nearly mechanics-complete and still just around 250loc
[00:49:37] <dto> Hey that's really cool I can't wait to see a screenshot or something
[00:49:57] <dto> I should have some screenshots within a few hours tonight. I just started hacking :-) when does the jam end? Six more days
[00:51:54] <technomancy> yeah I need to get in the habit of doing screenshots more
[01:04:29] <dthompson> quick screenshot https://files.dthompson.us/Screenshot%20from%202021-10-18%2017-32-06.png
[01:04:44] <dthompson> video would be better :)

[18:49:48] <technomancy> wait wait... rxi joined the lisp game jam in 2016? https://itch.io/jam/january-2016-lisp-game-jam/rate/50600
[18:50:41] <thrig> in the year 3 B.P.
[18:50:49] <Icefoz> Man, 10 days is too long for a game jam.
[18:50:53] <Icefoz> It gives me time to procrastinate.
[18:50:57] <technomancy> oh damn with his own dialect; classy https://github.com/rxi/aria
[18:51:31] <technomancy> those are always so fun to see, like "here; I made this game. it's the first program ever written in this language I created"
[19:26:42] <skeemer__> people i was reading the land of lisp... and in chapter 5 it builds the text adventure game... what i don
[19:27:17] <skeemer__> what i dont understand... is why is using backquoting and creating lists instead of text
[19:29:03] <technomancy> yeah I don't think anyone here has the chapters of land of lisp memorized
[19:29:07] <mfiano> You might want to start with Practical Common Lisp then. Treating code as data is one of the fundamental concepts of Lisp.
[19:29:27] <technomancy> if you have a question it would need to be more specific
[19:30:11] <thrig> I hear ' is used a lot in LISP but don't QUOTE me on that
[19:30:45] <contrapunctus> "Yes officer, this user right here. ^"
[19:30:54] <mfiano> 'thrig
[19:31:39] <skeemer__> technomancy, i intend this (defun describe-path (edge) `(there is a ,(caddr edge) going ,(cadr edge) from here.))
[19:32:48] <technomancy> skeemer__: my guess is that it's doing it with lists in order to illustrate a point. real code would use strings for a text adventure.
[19:32:50] <mfiano> That is similar to (list 'there 'is 'a (caddr edge) 'going (cadr edge) 'from 'here.)
[19:33:05] <mfiano> Feel free to write it out if you don't like splicing in data
[19:34:26] <technomancy> also real code would hopefully use destructuring instead of caddr because yikes
[19:34:50] <skeemer__> i don't know what is destructuring
[19:35:10] <mfiano> skeemer__: This book is not a very great introduction to Lisp.
[19:35:12] <technomancy> ah well, maybe that comes later after chapter 5 =)
[19:35:18] <mfiano> There are better if you are new to the idea.
[19:36:11] <skeemer__> mfiano, technomancy ok so basically in that case it would make sense to use strings instead of backquoting right ? 
[19:36:57] <mfiano> As always with programming: "that depends"
[19:37:16] <technomancy> skeemer__: yes for real code. I think the book is probably drawing a parallel between format strings and backtick or something in order to explain quoting in a way that corresponds with something you're already familiar with.
[19:38:07] <technomancy> honestly if you're trying to get something done in a short amount of time for a jam you are probably better off skipping quoting altogether and coming back to it after the jam
[19:38:14] <thrig> "Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes."
[19:38:16] <technomancy> it's not going to help you get the game done in the next 5 days
[19:38:21] <technomancy> lol
[19:39:10] <thrig> unless you "asset flip" some ()' and such
[19:49:54] *** Quits: azimut_ (~azimut@gateway/tor-sasl/azimut) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:57:19] <skeemer__> thrig, what's the meaning of  asset flip? what do you mean?
[19:57:50] <thrig> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip
[19:59:45] *** Joins: azimut (~azimut@gateway/tor-sasl/azimut)
[20:06:31] <Icefoz> That sounds boring, anyway.
[20:07:30] <Icefoz> I'm curious, anyone here planning on writing a blog post or postmortem or such about the game jam?
[20:07:45] <Icefoz> (I assume everyone's too busy to really publish things daily.)
[20:07:54] <technomancy> itch really wants you to write devlogs during the jam but yeah
[20:08:05] <technomancy> I always come back to it later if ever
[20:08:22] <technomancy> dunno if I'll do a writeup of this one tho; mine is pretty straightforward this time
[20:09:53] <technomancy> these are my write-ups from previous years: https://technomancy.us/187 | https://technomancy.us/190 | https://technomancy.us/193
[20:13:07] <borodust> if i ship anything this time, i'll drop a few lines :)
[20:14:51] <borodust> gonna be useful to ppl who wait alien-works and claw c++ news too :)
[20:40:32] <shoshin> skeemer__: i believe there's an updated version of the text adventure in the end of the book that introduces macros and a DSL for playing the game. but technomancy is right, its using symbols and lists for text in a pedagogical way, just introducing the fundamentals of Lisp a bit at a time
[20:42:48] <thrig> (there are probably better books to learn le fundamentals from)
[20:58:08] <skeemer__> thrig, i am ok with that book i actually think it is fantastic
[20:58:18] <skeemer__> i like the emphasized functional appraoch 
[20:59:24] <shoshin> land of lisp is why i am where i am today 
[20:59:40] <shoshin> being a ruby programmer xD
[21:01:02] <Icefoz> Game jams are not reeeeeeally the time to learn new tools.  XD
[21:01:38] <technomancy> not with an attitude like that =P
[21:03:53] <technomancy> agreed it's not a great time to be 5 chapters in to a book tho
[21:05:29] <dto> too many spores :) https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/V3Y625EM/Screenshot%20at%202021-10-18%2019-29-28.png

[21:07:49] <dto> :) hey shoshin !
[21:07:51] <dto> oh yeah? 
[21:07:55] <shoshin> i think you need a couple of grecian busts in there
[21:07:57] <dto> you should make a code screenie

[21:08:17] <shoshin> oh i'm just using solo-jazz its cyan/magenta highlights
[21:08:29] <dto> oh nice.
[21:08:58] <shoshin> https://github.com/cstby/solo-jazz-emacs-theme
[21:09:16] <shoshin> which does happen to be based off the very 90s solo cup Jazz design xD
[21:10:46] <dto> i like it
[21:16:02] <dto> i remember those cups
[21:19:50] <Icefoz> Our kids are growing up in such a weird world...
[21:21:12] <technomancy> a world where Solo Jazz cups are considered retro
[21:21:54] <Icefoz> a world where Solo Jazz cups are considered an aesthetic
[21:22:30] <skeemer__> Icefoz, i am not participating the game jam i am not enough skill
[21:22:40] <Icefoz> on the other hand, I just ruthlessly implemented collision detection the O(N^2) way, so I can't argue aesthetics
[21:22:43] <Icefoz> skeemer__: Oh, my bad then.
[21:22:46] <dto> a world where Emacs is older than Solo Jazz cups and that a 21st century music/visual aesthetic exists called VAPORWAVE
[21:23:48] <borodust> every time i read it as vaporware the first time
[21:24:20] <thrig> Duke Nukem /was/ released...
[21:32:45] <Icefoz> okay but i actually legit love vaporwave

[21:45:02] <dto> me2 :)
[21:53:42] <dthompson> dto: do you know a good resource for some free culture chiptune-type samples?
[21:54:24] <dthompson> I feel like I need a "starter pack" or something :)
[21:54:42] <dthompson> so I don't have to go hunting for each individual sample
[21:54:43] <dto> hrm. if i was tasked with making some, i'd probably use LMMS's built in SFXR plugin. i'm using it for some things in this game 
[21:55:06] <dto> you mean chiptune type waveforms? 
[21:55:10] <dto> or all kinds of samples? 
[21:55:37] <dto> i have plenty of Soundfonts. if you use a random soundfont in synthesis i'm pretty sure your resulting music is still free culture
[21:56:11] <dthompson> I don't want to make each sample. I'd like some wavs to use for things like percussion.
[21:57:40] <thrig> soundfonts + timidity -> wav files
[21:58:00] <dthompson> I'm using milkytracker if that helps
[22:00:19] <dthompson> like, I know about TR-808 drum samples. is there a good sample pack out there for chiptune style drums?
[22:00:23] <dto> oh. well there's a huge archive of XI instruments.
[22:00:36] <dthompson> I just don't know where to look :)
[22:01:07] <dto> http://tracker.modarchive.org/torrents/kiarchive.zip.torrent
[22:01:35] <dthompson> ah yeah I found that but it's a torrent
[22:01:35] <dto> http://tracker.modarchive.org/torrents/woolyss-chiptune-samples.zip.torrent
[22:01:46] <dto> right
[22:02:10] <dthompson> well I'll try it
[22:02:27] <dthompson> all freely licensed right?
[22:02:39] <dthompson> thanks
[22:02:43] <dto> well
[22:02:47] <technomancy> does anyone know any good resources for like ... how to write music using a tracker? like I can find plenty of resources for how the software works but I've never seen anyone actually explain how to make sounds that are good instead of sounds that are bad.
[22:02:54] <technomancy> it's always just assumed that you already know that stuff
[22:03:15] <dthompson> :) wish I knew
[22:03:22] <dto> dthompson: i wouldn't bet on being able to redistribute those files , but if you make music WITH them it's kosher,
[22:03:29] <technomancy> dthompson: maybe it's just that you have to learn music on a physical instrument first and there's just no way around that?
[22:03:34] <dto> like all my game music was made with those archives :)
[22:03:51] <dto> technomancy: i don't recommend tracking anymore. i would get into LMMS if you want to make game music
[22:04:12] <technomancy> dto: tracking is the only way to make music in TIC-80
[22:04:16] <thrig> tracking 45 left is sooo blade runner
[22:04:20] <dto> what's TIC-80
[22:04:26] <dthompson> having tried both milkytracker and lmms, milkytracker seems more my speed.
[22:04:33] <technomancy> dto: it's the fantasy console I use for my games
[22:04:44] <dto> oic. it requires .xm files for music? 
[22:04:47] <technomancy> https://tic80.com
[22:04:57] <technomancy> no, it's got a built-in integrated tracker
[22:05:32] <technomancy> https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Music-editor#tracker-mode
[22:06:05] <dthompson> technomancy: yeah maybe it's best to learn to play piano a bit first or something.
[22:06:15] <technomancy> dthompson: sounds hard
[22:06:17] <dthompson> I know drums, that's about it.  took a little music theory in school.
[22:06:42] <thrig> wait, there's more than three chords?
[22:06:49] <dthompson> nope
[22:06:55] <dto> cool project technomancy !
[22:06:56] <technomancy> I mean, yeah that does seem like the only way; I just wish there were like ... actually good material for teaching this stuff without it
[22:07:09] <technomancy> dto: I didn't make it, but I did add in lisp support to it and fix several bugs =)
[22:07:19] <dto> ah i c
[22:07:54] <technomancy> it's a more polished and more FOSS version of https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php which is more widespread
[22:09:53] <dto> my Xelf was once such a project. 
[22:10:50] <technomancy> oh yeah?
[22:10:56] <dto> dthompson: you may still want to play with LMMS and sfxr to make samples
[22:11:11] <technomancy> I hate to make a game that can't be edited by its players
[22:11:15] <dto> technomancy: yeah i have map editor and gui although 
[22:11:26] <technomancy> especially a lisp game
[22:12:14] <technomancy> I guess that's one advantage of using elisp for your game =D
[22:12:15] <Icefoz> technomancy: afaik composing/writing music is similar however you do it, a tracker is just like any other instrument.
[22:13:00] <technomancy> Icefoz: sure but all existing material written about composing assumes you will use a non-tracker instrument and that sucks
[22:13:20] <Icefoz> True.
[22:13:39] <technomancy> all the docs for trackers are like "now draw the rest of the fucking owl"
[22:14:22] <dthompson> yeah
[22:14:51] <dthompson> dto: I use sfxr to make sound effects. I want some pre-made samples for things like kick, snare, hi-hat
[22:15:18] <dto> ah ok. i'd check the kiarchive or waveworld torrents
[22:15:32] <dto> unless you want me to check them here. and give you some individuals
[22:16:06] <Icefoz> I don't remember where they came from but when I was learning milkytracker some of the tutorials for it linked me to some enormous free sample packs, let me see if I can find em...
[22:16:16] <dto> hi Icefoz 
[22:16:19] <dto> welcome to the jam!
[22:16:22] <dthompson> dto: the things you sent seem good
[22:16:31] <dthompson> found some usable stuff
[22:16:39] <dto> sweet!
[22:18:29] <Icefoz> Thanks dto, I'm currently trying to ignore the problem of music and hoping it goes away.
[22:20:14] <dthompson> I'm getting the hang of milkytracker
[22:20:53] <dthompson> if I can make one dumb song for my jam game that will be good
[22:21:16] <dto> dthompson: if you want to do your track mixing in a separate program, such as audacity, I can show you that there's a simple way to use a command line program to extract all the tracks as separate wavs
[22:21:44] <Icefoz> I liked milkytracker but haven't touched it for like three years.  I'll probably dig through some royalty free music to find something.
[22:22:49] <dthompson> dto: I think I'll keep it real simple for now
[22:23:03] <dto> Ok 😎
[22:23:21] <dto> I'm going to start working on the game in a little bit and try to make an epic video tonight

[23:01:08] <shoshin> dthompson: most chip based drums are just white noise with appropriate envelopes to give them a drum like dynamic
[23:01:41] <shoshin> i can maybe do a little video of what i did in TIC-80 to make the sounds a bit more palatable than the basic waveforms
[23:02:33] <shoshin> in other tracker programs, I've just used samples though. My best ones were from NitroTracker on the nintendoDS, i'd just record something into the mic for a drum hit or whistle or guitar or whatever
[23:04:04] <shoshin> technomancy: i almost always start by putting in a drum track first, and then usually bass unless a melody is calling to me
[23:05:08] <shoshin> some basic music theory is helpful. TLDR is use the white key notes and revolve your bass around C, F, and G for happy sounds
[23:08:02] <shoshin> there's some other more specific stuff to how trackers work, like "speed" which i'm not quite certain of. but again, i'll try to do a quick vid with TIC-80 sometime
[23:09:25] <Icefoz> Oh I would love that.
[23:09:42] <shoshin> i'm not an expert, but i can make a tune :P
[23:10:22] <technomancy> yeah it's pretty easy to find material about how tic's tracker itself works
[23:10:46] <technomancy> it's the "how to make notes which are good instead of notes which are bad" that is impossible to find
[23:11:24] <Icefoz> some basic music theory around chords and harmonies might be useful there.
[23:12:14] <Icefoz> some sets of notes and some transitions just go well together, because of the physics of how sound works and how we perceive it.
[23:12:49] <shoshin> yep. like major scale notes (white keys) and the intervals between them
[23:14:01] <shoshin> maybe not a topic for #lispgames but ┐(￣～￣)┌
[23:14:04] <Icefoz> (I have now told you everything I know about music theory.)
[23:16:07] <shoshin> it was once my hobby/focus of study
[23:16:23] <Icefoz> And hey, if Lisp programming isn't an appropriate venue for exploring the mysteries of the universe like music theory, idk what is.
[23:16:38] <shoshin> agreed
[23:17:22] <Icefoz> I took like half a class on it once and it used a Lisp based system for synthesizing sounds and such.

[23:19:27] <dto> more spores :) but they don't yet spew pollen
[23:30:44] <dthompson> hey your game has pollen too :)
[23:33:53] <dto> oh yeah? :) don't you have bees? 
[23:34:19] <dto> yeah i wanted the bio spores to spew toxic pollen
[23:39:32] <dto> i want to spend the next day or two refining the core player-veruss-spore dynamics
[23:39:34] *** Quits: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[23:39:47] <dto> i want it to be my fastest shooting game ever
[23:39:54] <dto> hows your project going dthompson ?
[23:39:56] <dthompson> yeah the bee player collects pollen for a powered-up shot
[23:40:15] <dthompson> it's going okay. have had very little time to work on it but still making progress.
[23:40:33] <dthompson> I have a few things left to implement, and then it's all just level scripting.
[23:41:15] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[23:41:21] <dto> nice. glad to hear
[23:42:12] <dthompson> dishwasher issue this morning cost me my morning hack time. didn't have any time yesterday. glad the jam is 10 days. :)
[23:42:19] <Icefoz> 10 days is way too long for a game jam, for me.  It gives me enough time to procrastinate.
[23:43:14] <dthompson> I only get a couple hours per day if I'm lucky so it makes it possible for me to submit something
[23:43:25] <dthompson> and even then I've only submitted twice despite many more attempts
[23:52:31] <Icefoz> I sympathize.
[23:54:22] <borodust> i always have new tech to test out and work too
[23:54:23] <borodust> 10 days good
[23:58:03] <borodust> barely ;p
[23:59:06] *** Joins: peterhil (~peterhil@mobile-access-56734e-227.dhcp.inet.fi)
[23:59:11] <borodust> CL is good against procrastination
[23:59:21] <borodust> you can get feedback super quick
[23:59:48] <borodust> so you make super small steps, see results immediately and procrastination goes away pretty quick
