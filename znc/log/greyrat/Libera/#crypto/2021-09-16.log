[22:19:44] <tomboy64> i am looking for an encryption scheme that lets me a) store data in a database (server-side) which is then only accessible with client-side decryption (public key encryption?)
[22:20:41] <tomboy64> and b) lets me "share" random intervals of data with third parties, so that allows creating decryption keys which only encompass specific intervals of datasets
[22:20:54] <tomboy64> any suggestion on what to look for?

[22:24:31] <Alipha> tomboy64: do you know the random intervals ahead of time and/or at the point at which you initially store the data?
[22:25:01] <tomboy64> no
[22:25:14] <TimMc> Who encrypts the data initially?
[22:25:36] <tomboy64> i'm planning, the server
[22:26:23] <tomboy64> i'm not sure this whole scheme is sensible in the first place. because if i trust the server to encrypt that stuff, which shouldn't he be trusted with access control then
[22:26:36] <tomboy64> s/which/why/
[22:27:20] *** Joins: cuz (~user@38.140.58.234)
[22:30:39] <Alipha> so, the server has public keys, a different client_PK for each client, and a single thirdParty_PK. the server would then encrypt the data received from the client with both the client-specific key and the thirdParty_PK. the third party would hold its corresponding thirdParty private key. (and each client would hold their own respective private keys)
[22:31:02] *** Joins: mmlj4 (~mmlj4@ip174-69-109-162.no.no.cox.net)
[22:31:21] <Alipha> it would be better if the client performed the encryption using the client_PK and the thirdParty_PK so that the server never sees the plaintext
[22:33:08] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[22:34:53] <tomboy64> yes
[22:35:44] <tomboy64> that would make sense. but it would require transferring the sharred data to the client before the server has data it can release to the third party
[22:36:32] <tomboy64> it's supposed to be a mobile application so the end devices (thin clients so to speak) would be mobile phones and i would prefer not to transfer data multiple times
[22:37:15] <Alipha> tomboy64: i meant encrypt the data using client_PK and separately encrypt the data with the thirdParty_PK, and send both ciphertexts to the server. in which case, whoever has the thirdParty private key would be able to decrypt the data
[22:37:18] <tomboy64> i envisioned some kind of transcoding from one encrypted state to another
[22:37:50] <Alipha> so, you don't actually have to encrypt the data multiple times, even though that's how i described it
[22:38:54] <tomboy64> ah, but that would require the third party is known ahead of time
[22:39:20] *** Joins: zro (~zro@user/zro)

[22:45:05] <Alipha> so your options are: 1) have a set of public keys that you encrypt with that you can then decrypt using the corresponding private keys later. 2) when a request to decrypt data in a specific timeframe occurs, have the server reach out to the clients to tell them to decrypt the data in that period. or 3) just not encrypt or give the server the decryption keys.

[22:51:10] <ms7821> hmm, unlikely
[22:54:51] <tomboy64> :)
[22:54:55] <ms7821> can you share some more details? how many discrete encrypted records will there be? how many clients? will clients ever want to read the same records? do clients join the system after the records are created?
[22:54:56] <tomboy64> likely
[22:55:08] <Alipha> tomboy64: let's recap your goal. You want to encrypt data so that the server can't decrypt it. Except that, wait, you actually do want the server to be able to decrypt it in order to provide this data to the third party
[22:55:28] <tomboy64> Alipha: indeed :D
[22:55:48] <Alipha> tomboy64: you see the flaw in that?
[22:55:58] <tomboy64> it's supposed to be a receiving server for gps data, that supports various protocols
[22:56:05] <ms7821> gps data is public
[22:56:07] <yawkat> just use ctr mode twice with the same iv
[22:56:39] <MacGyver> ms7821: Not if clients are sending you their location it's not.
[22:56:42] <tomboy64> so it receives the gps chunks, stores them. each device is assigned to a user - who obviously is supposed to have control of his data
[22:57:32] <tomboy64> but the idea now is for users to be able to share that data with selected third parties (via some identifier or something)
[22:57:44] <tomboy64> however, only for selected timeframes
[22:57:48] <ms7821> by gps chunks, do you mean location data from the clients, or gps messages from the satellites?
[22:58:11] <tomboy64> client != tracked devices
[22:58:24] <ms7821> I'm extremely confused by what you're building
[22:58:39] *** Quits: cuz (~user@38.140.58.234) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:58:55] <tomboy64> tracked devices send their position via ip to the server, which then stores the data

[22:59:03] *** Joins: cuz (~user@38.140.58.234)
[22:59:31] <tomboy64> the users who own those devices configure them for communication with the server
[22:59:44] <ms7821> and the server needs to see the contents of the messages before saving them?
[23:00:03] *** Quits: sec^nd (~sec^nd@gateway/tor-sasl/secnd/x-45171752) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:00:10] <tomboy64> yes. since the tracking devices have no built-in capacity for encryption.
[23:00:23] <ms7821> yikes, how are they transmitting it to the server?
[23:00:48] <tomboy64> custom binary packets. there's protocols for that. gt06 or gt07.
[23:02:19] <ms7821> so you've got a bunch of in-the-field devices that transmit their location in plaintext, gotcha
[23:02:45] <ms7821> and you want to encrypt them at rest, presumably to prevent an attacker from seeing historic data or something?
[23:02:56] <tomboy64> however, that is essentially private, potentially sensitive data.
[23:03:00] <tomboy64> yes
[23:03:07] <ms7821> if it's potentially sensitive, don't send it plaintext
[23:04:14] <tomboy64> :) i am aware of that

[23:14:14] *** Quits: Everything (~Everythin@37.115.210.35) (Quit: leaving)
[23:14:41] <ms7821> something you could do is store it in a separate system with very limited access, e.g. different server/AWS account, and put strong controls around accessing that system so at least it's audited and you can alert if unusual access happens
[23:15:43] <ms7821> but for non-esoteric cryptography you need a key to encrypt to, and you ideally want to encrypt on the device
[23:16:31] <ms7821> (I'm surprised the device can transmit to a server, but not perform encryption, that's very ~2000s)
[23:18:22] <tomboy64> it's embedded devices. essentially trackers that you plug a sim card into and then stuff them into a car.
