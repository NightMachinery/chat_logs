[01:02:44] <veesh> i started my list of issues by simply running it on my day to day code, and sifting through the piles of barf

[01:04:34] <veesh> i have to go to bed now, but i will surely hit this up
[01:04:40] <LeoNerd> Righty
[01:05:25] <veesh> do you want to do this test-driven? just compile a list of progressively more complex tests to get green?
[01:05:59] <LeoNerd> Most definitely.. that's how I always work
[01:06:35] <LeoNerd> As I was explaining to someone about libvterm earlier today: the tests are the primary description of "What does this thing do?" The actual code is just a way to help the implementation work out how to pass the tests
[01:08:55] <veesh> anyways, unless you actually see the tree you generate, it's hard to think about the parser at all
[01:09:00] <LeoNerd> Yuh
[01:09:12] <LeoNerd> :TSPlaygroundToggle  is fun for that
[01:09:32] <veesh> is that built in (you got me to swtich to neovim, btw)?
[01:09:43] <LeoNerd> It's part of nvim-treesitter
[01:09:59] <LeoNerd> neovim doesn't *natively* use treesitter.. at least, not yet. That itself is a plugin to enable it
[01:10:10] <veesh> i though 0.6 uses it natively
[01:10:24] *** Quits: proller (~p@80.240.216.69) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[01:11:10] <veesh> interesting, b/c i have help docs w/o it

[01:14:08] <xenu> how does it tree-sitter work in nvim? i mean, doesn't nvim use the same perl plugin as vim?
[01:14:19] <xenu> does it have support for using a different parser? or nvim can override that?
[01:14:32] <veesh> you would need to set up the parser (that we're discussing building)
[01:15:12] <LeoNerd> Natively, nvim uses the same  syntax/*.vim  files that regular vim uses. Optionally you can install an nvim plugin called `nvim-treesitter` which replaces its synhi engine
[01:15:21] <LeoNerd> So now instead of using those syntax/*.vim files it asks the treesitter plugin

[01:41:31] <xenu> tomorrow is fat tuesday, which means that everyone is buying pączki in poland. stores are treating them as loss-leaders because if you won't sell them you will lose clients that might buy other things
[01:41:36] <xenu> which means that prices are *crazy*
[01:42:16] <LeoNerd> Is that some sort of edible item?
[01:42:21] <xenu> for example one supermarket chain is selling 12 pączki for 3 PLN, which means 0.25PLN per pączek

[07:39:26] <xenu> anyway eot, i shouldn't have started a political discussion here
[07:40:53] <EvanCarroll> The right for a hegemon to protect its region of influence is a de facto right of the hegemon and one that United States demands and acknowleges. So it seems pointless to pretend like it doesn't exist.
[07:41:39] <EvanCarroll> It's not like the United States didn't first invade and then threatened WWIII when the shoe was on the other foot and the USSR aligned with Cuba, and then offered to equip it for its own self-defense.

[10:14:24] <EvanCarroll> I think it's less fucked up. The justifications that Russia is making is one of defense, which is has infinitely more merit than in _any_ of the above cases. And, also one of the right of self-determination of the people in the states it is acknowledging, which there is also some credit in.

[11:15:05] <EvanCarroll> bkhl: Russia has not invaded Syria. It's there by invitation from the soverign government. The United States has invaded Syria. It is there to destablize and challange the soverign government.
[11:15:32] <bkhl> Yeah, but the legitimacy of that government is rather questionable.
[11:15:42] <EvanCarroll> bkhl: now if that distinction doesn't matter to you, that's fine. But then let's not pretend like Ukraine's sovereignty is of substance here.
[11:16:02] <EvanCarroll> bkhl: not in the eyes of international law.
[11:16:17] <bkhl> Sure, but there are also other things than international law.
[11:16:24] <bkhl> Like morals and stuff.
[11:18:10] <bkhl> Although there are also international laws that talk about self-determination, which is a lot more valid for Ukraine than for Syria.
[11:18:16] <bkhl> Given the state of democracy in each.
[11:18:24] <EvanCarroll> All that I'm saying is you're special casing _everything_ rather than making a moral justification. The argument here is that Putin is violating international law by aggressing on a sovereign nation. Soverignty is only useful if it has standing. In the eyes of international law BOTH Ukraine and Syria are sovereign.
[11:18:59] <EvanCarroll> If you want only-Syria to be soverign, that's very pro-Russia of you. If you want only-Ukraine to be sovereign that's very pro-USA.
[11:19:17] <EvanCarroll> so you have no moral standing if your answer isn't "both are sovereign"
[11:20:38] <EvanCarroll> bkhl: the international laws of self-determination do not speak of nation states but of people. In the context of nation states, there is no self-determination, they're protected by actual international law already.
[11:20:52] <EvanCarroll> In the context of people, you'd find _more_ merit to Putin's argument.
[11:21:34] <EvanCarroll> Which is that a region ethnically and culturally Russian is in the right to associate with whatever nation they choose. While there hasn't been a vote, the vote would almost certainly now be in Russia's favor.

[13:06:24] <EvanCarroll> released later show that the 2009 removal was supported by Hillary Clinton's State Department by not recognizing it as coup in order to maintain U.S. aid to the Honduran people. Clinton and her team worked behind the scenes to stall military and economic efforts by neighboring countries through the Organization of American States to restore Manuel Zelaya to office. "The OAS meeting today turned into a 
[13:06:30] <EvanCarroll> non-event ― just as we hoped," wrote one senior State Department official, celebrating their success in defusing what they judged would have been a violent or destabilizing restoration.[121] Secretary Clinton had also helped organize elections where she, Latin American leaders and diplomats, in her own words "strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections 
[13:06:36] <EvanCarroll> could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot".[122]

[16:06:58] <vanessa> hi I am trying to remove html tag with `cat index.html | perl -nE 'print if s/<\/?pre>|(.*)/\1/g'` but it is only removing the first occurance.
[16:07:06] <vanessa> any idea why?

[16:10:15] <Altreus> are you sure you want "print if" with a substitution?
[16:10:26] <choroba> vanessa: The general answer is "do't use regex to parse HTML"
[16:11:10] <choroba> specific answer is .* matches as much as it can, including any <pre>
[16:11:22] <Altreus> And the | in that regex does not seem appropriate
[16:11:36] <vanessa> choroba: it is just a simple html of few lines, I just want to remove <pre> tags.
[16:11:51] <choroba> Including their contents or just the tags?
[16:11:57] <choroba> can they have attributes?
[16:12:02] <choroba> can they be commented out?
[16:12:18] <vanessa> Altreus: what is wrong with 'print if' with s/ ?
[16:12:59] <vanessa> choroba: only the tags, not it's content. and it has no attributes and it is never commented.
[16:13:41] <tm604> `print if` only prints if something was replaced
[16:13:42] <choroba> s{</?pre>}{}g should do
[16:13:50] <choroba> no if
[16:14:14] <choroba> maybe }gi if they can be upper case
[16:14:54] <vanessa> ok, this is what I am doing, I am going from markdown to html and stupid pandoc is converting ``` into <pre><code>this</code></pre> and I want only <code>this</code>.

[16:16:31] <Altreus> s won't print anything at all, but print if s won't print unmached lines, no
[16:16:40] <Altreus> vanessa: that's fine; browsers do
[16:17:07] <Altreus> <code> does not necessarily imply preformatted whitespace, and <pre> stuff is not necessarily code
[16:17:31] <Altreus> pandoc's error, if any, is assuming that ``` means code, whereas it only means pre

[19:20:23] <LeoNerd> Such strictness on sub-checking would forbid this
[19:21:16] <LeoNerd> Actually that particular example might be a bit of a bad one, but that kind of thing is totally possible. You can _at runtime_ require a module and then call functions from it, provided that the callsite had parens on it would still compile OK without having that module loaded
[19:21:22] <LeoNerd> The presence of the function is only checked at runtime
[19:21:44] <hethw> nice
[19:22:04] <haarg> Sub::StrictDecl requires all subs to be defined before they are used. a lot of code calls subs that are declared later in the same file.
[19:22:10] <LeoNerd> This sortof cuts to the core of what it *means* to be "a dynamic language", and thus is always going to somehow limit the amount of static checking you can perform

[20:57:16] <LeoNerd> veesh: https://github.com/leonerd/tree-sitter-perl/issues  -- a few issues here to be getting on with. ;) My general aim will be to work on each one, and once it's fixed collect up pairs of before/after screenshots from nvim, showing definite improvement in those examples. They've asked us to keep that sort of evidence around, to help justify them switching the parser
