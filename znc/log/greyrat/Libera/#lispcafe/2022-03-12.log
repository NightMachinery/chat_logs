[04:15:23] <gilberth> What happened?
[04:15:26] <hayley> Just finished my questionnaire for the job opening at RavenPack.
[04:16:20] <gilberth> Oh. A questionnaire? What was the most embarrassing question?
[04:17:31] <hayley> Don't think I should say.
[04:18:54] <GreaseMonkey> "Which of these given letters of the alphabet is your favourite and why?"
[04:19:23] <hayley> I guess the most appropriate answer for a Common Lisp job has to be T.
[04:19:57] <GreaseMonkey> and your least favourite would be C, right? :^)
[04:20:20] <hayley> Right.
[04:20:59] <GreaseMonkey> some psychometric tests ask people what their favourite letter is out of a list of about 4 different letters
[04:21:25] <gilberth> My favorite would be "G". Why? It's obvious.
[04:21:29] <hayley> Which answer gets me diagnosed with psychopathy?
[04:21:37] <gilberth> P?
[04:22:28] <GreaseMonkey> an appropriate psychometric test would have a way to determine if the person taking it believes that psychometric tests are bullshit
[04:23:38] <gilberth> I don't know. We recently learned that the way you eat corn tells something about how you think.

[04:29:23] <hayley> Last semester I did not do all the work.

[15:11:07] <hayley> inbox "wow u have to spend like another US$70 on your US$700 without sale CPU"
[15:12:49] <hayley> But I found out I can make REGRIND like 6x faster by using SBCL's interpreter rather than compiler. Though that means I assume the Lisp compiler is well behaved, which might not be great, actually.
[15:15:33] <hayley> I also found a RE which either has a big DFA or fails to make a DFA (and I can't yet tell which). Seems I have something pathological in my DFA generator where it becomes painfully slow over 200 states or so.
[15:16:32] <random-nick> didn't some manufacturers have some special bios you can flash in order to run a zen 3 processor?
[15:17:05] <hayley> Maybe? But this is a Zen 1 board, and I heard that was for Zen 2 era boards.
[15:19:51] <hayley> But I guess that the DFA generator failing is more of a threat than the Lisp compiler doing something dumb these days. And now I can't tell if I found something or not.

[19:09:23] <gilberth> My MacMini feels like it is using PIO mode for disk access. I copy some GBs with a low rate of about a mere 4MB/s yet response time to keystroke e.g. is really going up. At times there is a very noticeable latency. I suspect trashing though.

[19:43:58] <shka> gilberth: well, mac mini? here is your problem
[19:44:40] <shka> the funniest and most consistent feature of apple computers was overheating
[19:45:15] <Lycurgus> i'm on my second one, the first one lasted more than a decade
[19:49:19] <gilberth> shka: This machine is a decade olde and always was poor. And it has a spinning disk. Unfortunately the newer and faster machine I has a broken soldered SSD. The other machine which sits at my evil house is fine, too.
[19:50:17] <gilberth> But then, rebooting Firefox helps. I mean, using 12GB for just a browser is a bit excessive. And, no, I am not a tab messy.
[19:54:32] <gilberth> Lycurgus: I am not that lucky. I have seen three of those machines which all died out of the blue. Of about a dozen total or so. That's poor. Very poor.
[19:55:34] <Lycurgus> really, I've only had one mac die, and it was like a decade old imac
[19:56:27] <Lycurgus> the cd died on the old mac mini but otherwise it still ran more or less until I shitcanned it within the last year (a '09 model)
[19:56:50] <gilberth> I never would buy an iMac. Why dispose the screen, when you want a new machine? My screens usually outlast my machines by a fair bit.
[19:57:40] <Lycurgus> i replaced the iMac with an eMac a guy in the area who fixes them sold me when i got the stuff off the dead imac
[19:58:03] <Lycurgus> the eMac still works fine and I keep it as furniture and because it's not intel
[19:58:23] <gilberth> Otherwise. Replacing an mac is really easy. Restoring from a Time Machine backup always worked without a glitch for me.
[19:59:22] <Lycurgus> yeah i use timemachine with a cheap sandisk
[19:59:56] <gilberth> My linux server keeps the Time Machine backups.
[20:00:26] <Lycurgus> i use rsync for linux but gonna look for a timemachine workalike
[20:00:33] <gilberth> This even works over an DSL land line. Slow, very slow. But you don't need to hold hands.
[20:01:12] <Lycurgus> slow pipe backup sounds like a bad idea
[20:01:56] <gilberth> Well, it's off site. And you really want a backup off site.
[20:02:03] <Lycurgus> i had DSL in the 90s, it never really caught on here
[20:02:23] <Lycurgus> in biz you do
[20:02:26] <gilberth> Ah, so what does your ISP use?
[20:02:51] <Lycurgus> well actually that's in transition
[20:02:59] <gilberth> Lycyrgus: Indeed. We would be dead in the water without our data.
[20:03:26] <Lycurgus> i've had cable modems with cable internet suppliers this century, the norm in the US
[20:03:41] <Lycurgus> but 5g wireless is beginning to replace it
[20:04:01] <gilberth> Cable is a shared medium. I don't like that.
[20:04:29] <Lycurgus> verizon vs spectrum here
[20:04:54] <Lycurgus> i could triple the rate by switching but it's more hassel than it's worth right now
[20:04:58] <Alfr> gilberth, wait, and DSL isn't?
[20:06:00] <gilberth> Alfr: Not on the last mile. I see no degeneration in speed in the evening when people would come home and watch Netflix.
[20:06:58] <Lycurgus> that's not general observed in cable internet suppliers in the US
[20:07:04] <Lycurgus> *generally
[20:07:12] <Alfr> gilberth, I have never observed that here.
[20:07:25] <gilberth> I have seen that with cable.
[20:08:02] <Lycurgus> here it's fiber to the nid so ... .
[20:08:39] <gilberth> Doesn't bother me much though because I am awake until 4:00 or 6:00 when most people sleep and I could have the full bandwidth. This was the case with the LTE link we had at the other rural town, where a land line would have been 0.384Mbps on a dry day.
[20:09:24] <gilberth> On a rainy day your data rate would have been zero bits per seconds.
[20:11:19] <Lycurgus> btw the other day we were talking about parallel gc, allegro has it
[20:13:02] <Lycurgus> did look into to yet to see if it's concurrent with lisp threads, but i assume so

[23:01:27] <shka> how do you even make gamma ray laser?

[23:02:43] <selwyn> you use electrons
[23:02:49] *** Joins: euandreh (~euandreh@2804:14c:33:9fe5:2e86:80a5:f58b:d1a4)
[23:02:56] <shka> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_laser
[23:03:04] <selwyn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_XFEL quite different from a traditional laser
[23:03:37] <selwyn> short pulsed lasers have gotten better recently
[23:03:39] <shka> i love how it is called graser
[23:03:53] <selwyn> i would guess that only recent technological advances let people consider this kind of thing
[23:04:17] <shka> well, there are also metamaterials
[23:04:32] <selwyn> to make a gamma ray laser?
[23:05:25] <shka> i don't know, but engineers managed to make ordinary light their bitch already 
[23:05:49] <shka> and maybe it would be possible to achieve something with gamma/x rays as well
[23:06:01] <selwyn> i did hear good things about this x ray free electron laser
[23:06:16] <selwyn> though iirc it was from people trying to convince us to work there
[23:07:13] <selwyn> i don't think a metamaterial would help that much
[23:08:00] <shka> well, the last time i checked still nobody knew how exactly they worked
[23:08:05] <shka> so...
[23:08:06] <selwyn> gamma rays are so high energy
[23:08:33] <selwyn> i would be surprised if metamaterials have some kind of transition that is at the right frequency
[23:09:20] <shka> something something harmonics
[23:09:21] <selwyn> anyway, this free electron laser can already do x rays
[23:10:31] <shka> this would exciting
[23:11:00] <shka> transmutation with gamma laser 
[23:11:03] <shka> hot damn
[23:11:21] <selwyn> oh, maybe you could make a mirror for the gamma rays out of metamaterials
[23:11:41] <shka> there was episode about transmutation of matter at ASFIA
[23:12:32] <shka> selwyn: IIRC they kinda made gamma ray lenses out of aluminum with drilled holes in them 
[23:13:37] <shka> back in the star wars program
[23:15:00] <selwyn> sounds weird
[23:15:56] <shka> well, gamma rays is still a wave
[23:16:20] <shka> but it is true, look it up
[23:16:51] <shka> this was long before metamaterials were a thing, so you never know
[23:17:11] <shka> having gamma ray mirror would be a game changer for many applications
[23:20:29] <selwyn> hm
[23:23:31] <pl> Look at how x-ray lenses are done 
[23:24:21] <pl> As x-rays and gamma essentially overlap (for various reasons the difference is mostly historical, iirc) 
[23:24:33] <selwyn> pl: thats what i thought
[23:24:46] <selwyn> well, difference depends on the source
[23:24:54] <pl> selwyn: nope 
[23:24:55] <shka> that's silly difference
[23:25:51] <pl> It is, afaik, how it started 
[23:26:23] <pl> These days the difference used is overlapping but different frequency ranges 
[23:26:27] <selwyn> oh
[23:27:15] <pl> Also, FELs are interesting, because they can theoretically get you any frequency that fits in their cavity 
[23:27:28] <shka> ...
[23:27:33] <shka> pl: why do you know this?
[23:27:41] <pl> (too low and you get annoying reflections, afaik) 
[23:28:27] <pl> shka: I might have designed a spaceship for a sci-fi story that was essentially a giant interconnected matrix of FELs 
[23:28:38] <selwyn> i thought free electron lasers didn't have cavities?
[23:29:00] <pl> selwyn: in this case it's a shorthand for interior space of the laser 
[23:29:37] <pl> It is, technically, a cavity, even if it's not classic laser design 
[23:29:57] <pl> Also one FEL can feed into another to raise the frequency 
[23:30:14] <pl> I handwaved it in the story to raise the overall power of the beam 
[23:30:46] * gilberth takes a break after sorting a couple hundred PDF files and looks for coffee.
[23:35:27] <selwyn> this gamma ray laser seems just about possible
[23:36:08] <shka> let's turn atoms into our playthings with this bad boy
[23:37:17] <shka> seriously, this is all new to me
[23:37:45] <selwyn> my university does work adjacent to this, particularly with very short pulsed lasers
[23:37:58] <selwyn> i didn't know you could apply it to nuclear waste processing
[23:38:24] <shka> well, neither anyone in 2020 as it seems
[23:39:10] <selwyn> https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233237/fastest-ever-study-electrons-respond-x-rays-performed/ they use it more for spectroscopy applications
[23:39:11] -ixelp- Fastest-ever study of how electrons respond to X-rays performed | Imperial News | Imperial College London
[23:39:16] <shka> i am trying to be up to date with state of art in everything nuclear 
[23:39:29] <shka> and I never seen this before 
[23:40:08] <shka> the weird thing is 
[23:41:00] <shka> I THINK that this should, in theory at least, allow to extract power out of nuclear waste 
[23:41:39] <selwyn> well, you are doing stimulated fission iiuc
[23:41:45] <selwyn> which releases heat
[23:42:23] <selwyn> this is probably more of a problem than an advantage though, because your nuclear waste disposal machine can't get too hot
[23:42:32] <selwyn> so now you have to cool the thing
[23:42:35] <shka> this could be a second nobel in the making 
[23:42:49] <shka> if they manage to actually pull this off
[23:43:29] <shka> selwyn: no, this is possibly revolution for the breeding reactors technology
[23:43:45] <shka> the old issue with those, and one that eventually killed research in the USA
[23:43:53] <shka> and fuel reprocessing as well actually 
[23:44:12] <shka> is that you need to have highly enriched fuel to start the reaction 
[23:44:31] <selwyn> uh
[23:44:47] <shka> if you would have technology to stimulate fission...
[23:44:53] <selwyn> i would rather rely on highly enriched fuel than a fancy laser
[23:45:11] <shka> well, you can't make a nuclear bomb out of laser :-)
[23:45:29] <selwyn> oh right
[23:45:48] <selwyn> i am jealous of nuclear because of how easy it is to make stuff
[23:45:56] <selwyn> its all done in industrial processes
[23:46:12] <shka> also, this could be the thing that would make TWR and stuff like that easier
[23:46:27] <selwyn> manipulating single atoms is such a pain in comparison
[23:47:23] <shka> and if we would have to sustain civilization, breeder reactors are one thing that should be figured out
[23:47:35] <shka> there is a lot of depleted uranium in the world
[23:47:46] <shka> so much so that Americans shot that crap as ammo 
[23:48:35] <selwyn> yes they did
