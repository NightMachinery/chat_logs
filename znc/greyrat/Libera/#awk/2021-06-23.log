[17:37:26] <simoneb> I'm trying to remove a certain section from a file, the sections are delimited by "---", this one-liner kind of works but I get rogue "---" in places where they shouldn't be, what's wrong? example: echo -e "a\n---\nb\n---\nc\n---\nd\ne" | mawk '{ RS="\n---\n" ; ORS="\n---\n" } !/c/ { print  }'
[17:38:16] <simoneb> this should be supposed to remove the part that contains "c", which it does, but it also adds an extra "---" towards the beginning of the output

[17:45:37] <simoneb> oh, that's it? it fixed it
[17:45:58] <simoneb> how does adding BEGIN fix the issue? the "---" was leaking into the printed string
[17:48:09] <mknod> awk consumes a\n, and then it sets RS / ORS, and then it cannot find "\n---\n"

[17:56:04] <mknod> simoneb, so it catches "---\nb" as a section content. Do you get it?
[18:01:45] <simoneb> Yeah I think so. The processing starts before the RS is set and it is ignored for the first line. Thanks!

[18:02:57] <simoneb> That was meant to remove a portion of a YAML file. I tried with yq which is supposed to be a yaml parser, but apparently it's easier done with awk.

[22:02:13] <gnomon> vinipsmaker, I've never heard of that kind of thing being done with pure awk, no.  It might be possible, but it's not really an application that would let awk's virtues produce their best value.
[22:10:19] <yeti> https://hackaday.com/2016/07/13/gawking-hex-files/ <<< may be a start. I don't know how much of it really is specific to GAWK... so add some grains of salt...
