[09:59:40] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: The hardcover is long out of print.
[09:59:50] <CuriosTiger> I settled for the $10 paperback. Richard Lederer is hilarious.
[10:00:49] <CuriosTiger> Anguished English is the best one though
[10:00:57] <StayHungry> i would pay 130 for hardcover of Adages of Erasmus Roterodamus :)
[10:01:30] <CuriosTiger> Short of as an investment for resale, I can't think of any book I'd pay $130 for.
[10:08:07] <pussipupu> if I were right enough I might
[10:08:23] <pussipupu> but as it stands I need a new cooker and new shoes
[10:08:24] <StayHungry> in the society of spectacle, planned obsolescence and fleeting fashion with relative values and discarded authorities, classical books of wisdom to live by, especially when they're carefully crafted, are gems
[10:08:52] <CuriosTiger> I mean, I spent $130 today
[10:08:55] <CuriosTiger> but that was on groceries.
[10:09:03] <StayHungry> o_O
[10:09:16] <CuriosTiger> (I had to restock my pantry after the weevil infestation.)
[10:12:50] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: how long did it take to adjust to the imperial system of measures?
[10:13:10] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: I'm still working on it.
[10:13:19] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: crazy one, huh? :)
[10:13:22] <CuriosTiger> I mean, I can deal with most of it
[10:13:49] <CuriosTiger> but I still get stuck with things like....is 5/16 larger or smaller than a 3/8
[10:14:00] <StayHungry> yep
[10:14:02] <CuriosTiger> and exactly how many fluid ounces are there to a pint?
[10:14:14] <CuriosTiger> I have many of the conversions memorized, but not all of them.
[10:15:09] <pussipupu> The US doesn't use the Imperial System
[10:15:18] <CuriosTiger> It sort of does.
[10:15:26] <pussipupu> e.g. their pints are smaller
[10:15:31] <CuriosTiger> sure, their gallons too
[10:15:34] <CuriosTiger> and they use tons
[10:15:38] <CuriosTiger> which can be long, short OR metric.
[10:16:07] <pussipupu> do they not call metric tons tonnes?
[10:16:13] <CuriosTiger> but the differences from imperial are minor. Just enough to throw another wrench in the works.
[10:16:21] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: Not consistently, no.
[10:16:28] <CuriosTiger> whereas Brits call even imperial tons tonnes.
[10:16:42] <StayHungry> i guess it was intentional to support never ending lawyers and judges :D
[10:16:42] <CuriosTiger> because ton/tonne originated as a british/american spelling difference, not as a distinction between types of tons.
[10:16:49] <pussipupu> not in my experience we don't
[10:16:50] <CuriosTiger> it's the same as with check/cheque
[10:17:06] <pussipupu> though people rarely refer to Imperial tons anyway
[10:18:03] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: *shrug* I'm not an expert on British usage, but I can assure you that American usage is consistently inconsistent.
[10:18:35] <pussipupu> I'm very willing to accept that
[10:18:54] <StayHungry> they call it United States customary units :D
[10:19:19] <StayHungry> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_imperial_and_US_customary_measurement_systems
[10:19:58] <CuriosTiger> OK, the number of decimals in that article is ridiculous.
[10:20:56] <CuriosTiger> but now I know most of the English-speaking countries of the world agreed to a standardized definition of yards and pounds in 1959.
[10:23:23] <ksft> I've never heard of a "US dry pint"
[10:23:39] <pussipupu> A small but noticeable bonus of leaving the UK is more consistently metric measurements
[10:23:44] <ksft> not to be confused, apparently, with a regular US pint or an imperial pint
[10:23:51] <ksft> and then there's the occasionally-used metric pint
[10:24:39] <StayHungry> from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_States -> as of 2021 the United States is one of only three countries (the others being Myanmar and Liberia)  that have not officially adopted the metric system as the primary means of weights and measures. (but but the process is slowly, but surely and inexorably moving towards common sense)
[10:25:24] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: I don't know about Finland, but in Norway, we still have some archaic units
[10:25:46] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: for tourists perhaps :)
[10:26:01] <pussipupu> Nothing springs to mind here, but I couldn't guarantee there aren't any
[10:26:23] <CuriosTiger> The lumber industry measures timber in tommer ("thumbs", basically inches)
[10:26:40] <CuriosTiger> Boat speed is measured in knop (knots, or nautical miles)
[10:27:08] <pussipupu> oh but nautical miles and knots are sensible
[10:27:18] <CuriosTiger> and beer is sometimes measured in seidels
[10:27:26] <pussipupu> being based on degrees
[10:27:26] <CuriosTiger> Why? Just use km/h
[10:27:29] <CuriosTiger> :P
[10:27:54] <pussipupu> because one uses charts marked in degrees for navigation
[10:28:14] <pussipupu> so the nautical mile is already present anyway
[10:28:27] <CuriosTiger> All these units were "already present"
[10:28:31] <CuriosTiger> the metric ones are the new invention
[10:28:32] <StayHungry> :D
[10:28:57] <pussipupu> they're already present in navigation
[10:29:03] <CuriosTiger> Oh, there's also "mål" (literally "measure" for the size of property)
[10:29:08] <pussipupu> because they're based on degrees
[10:29:41] <pussipupu> m^2 or hectares here for that
[10:29:43] <CuriosTiger> which used to be defined as 10,000 square feet
[10:29:53] * LuisP14 meters in o.o ...
[10:30:04] <CuriosTiger> but got redefined with metrification to equal 1000 square meters
[10:30:14] <CuriosTiger> aka decares
[10:30:29] <pussipupu> I only realised the other day that the hectare is a derived unit based on the are
[10:30:32] <CuriosTiger> (or 1/10th of a hectare)
[10:31:02] <StayHungry> let's start with basics. height. if you're 175 cm, it equals to 9, when you're 177 cm -> 9.5 (they write it as 9½), but hey, what about 176?
[10:31:31] <CuriosTiger> I'm 188 cm.
[10:31:56] <StayHungry> 6.2
[10:31:59] <CuriosTiger> Not quite
[10:32:11] <CuriosTiger> 6' 1.7"
[10:32:15] <StayHungry> omg...
[10:32:17] <CuriosTiger> but yeah, I round it to 6'2"
[10:32:24] <CuriosTiger> so I don't have to feel inadequate
[10:32:44] <CuriosTiger> hrm, except that's wrong too
[10:32:44] <StayHungry> but what to do if you're 176? feeling oppressed? :D
[10:33:10] <CuriosTiger> when I put it in the other way, 6'2" is 187.96 cm

"Yes or no?" in this case is meaningless, because answering "Yes" or "No" would be ambigous, IMO. "Yes" could mean "Yes, I don't want milk." or "Yes, I want milk." But "Yes or no?" could refer to a previous question "(Do you want)/(With) Milk?" Still ambigous. You could answer: "Yes, please." or "Yes, with milk."
[12:36:18] <darsie> Well, it's not meaningless, it asks for a clear response.

[13:35:49] <TechTest> professional and cheap?
[13:36:51] <blkshp> There's 2 types of coffee beans Arabica and Robusta. Arabica are harder to cultivate but have a smoother taste with less caffeine. The Robusta are, ironically more robust which makes them cheaper but they're a little more bitter and not as smooth.
[13:37:12] <blkshp> That's why a lot of coffee products you buy will show off the fact of "100% Arabica beans"
[13:38:14] <blkshp> So cheaper coffees often include robusta beans because they are indeed cheaper to buy. (also professional grade coffees often have them because it means a larger profit margin to the business or smaller prices for the consumer.
[13:38:31] <TechTest> yeah usually I tend to find better those that are "100% arabica"
[13:38:46] <TechTest> Jacobs la meloise just tastes great

[19:39:16] <Oleg> pussipupu: the verb "learn" makes more sense in this sentence once you change "on" to "at". With "at", the sentence becomes more figurative, and less literal.
[19:39:20] <kurahaupo> English uses a large number of word categories, partly based on their etymological origins, but unlike Latinate languages there's no hint from the suffixes to remind you which category it's in, and we don't have names or labels for most of the categories; so it's quite normal for native speakers to disagree on which categories a word is in, or even whether certain categories are distinct at all. So "English is difficult to learn" probabl
[19:39:21] <kurahaupo> has some merit
[19:39:42] <ksft> I'm extremely skeptical of that claim
[19:40:28] <kurahaupo> Getting that basics is probably easier; getting to native parity is probably harder, especially if you learn from multiple sources
[19:43:08] <kurahaupo> It's hard to ascertain from anecdotal evidence, because each person only gets to learn their second language once, and that affects their adaptability to learn a third language and so on

[19:45:10] <pussipupu> Oleg, I disagree it's just the normal protrusion proposition for that reference to lists
[19:45:10] <kurahaupo> But I'm not blinded to the difficulty of learning English just because it happens to be my native language; I see how learners struggle with particular points, most of which result in "sorry, you have to learn an arbitrary category distinction"
[19:48:03] <kurahaupo> "I put Einstein at the top of the list of famous people" vs "I put my coffee mug on top of the list of famous people that was on my desk"

[22:55:45] <Guest9> how many irregular verbs are there in english?
[22:58:14] <nimue> Oh wow tricky
[22:58:25] <ksft> I don't think you can give a number
[22:58:31] <huf> at least one
[22:58:33] <nimue> I would get a good decent grammar.
[22:58:47] <ksft> I might even say at least seven
[22:58:49] <StayHungry> Guest9: wikipedia lists 204
[22:58:50] <nimue> I used to love this one by Michael Swan
[22:59:04] <nimue> A professor at university recommended.

[23:00:35] <Guest9> StayHungry https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/table-of-irregular-verbs here it is quite less

[23:03:43] <xenial-user10> .w cram
[23:03:44] <tinsoldier> cram — Noun: 1. The act of cramming (forcing or stuffing something)., 2. Information hastily memorized., 3. (weaving) A warp having more than two threads passing through each dent or split of the reed., 4. (dated, British slang) A lie; a falsehood., — Verb: 1. (transitive) To press, force, or drive, particularly in filling, or in thrusting one thing i <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cram>...
[23:03:58] <StayHungry> Guest9: there are common and uncommon irregular verbs, i guess
[23:04:26] <xenial-user10> !more
[23:04:27] <tinsoldier> nto another; to stuff; to fill to superfluity., 2. (transitive) To fill with food to satiety; to stuff., 3. (transitive) To put hastily through an extensive course of memorizing or study, as in preparation for an examination., 4. (intransitive) To study hard; to swot.
[23:05:14] <StayHungry> Guest9: use any online source with a grain of salt as a place to start a research, not to rely on immediately
[23:05:34] <ksft> lots of old words have irregular inflections that have slowly given way to regular ones as the words become less common
[23:06:19] <ksft> think alumnus/alumna/alumni/alumnae vs. the more modern usage of "alumni" for all four
[23:06:26] <ksft> which also isn't regular, I guess
[23:06:40] <Guest9> is that verb?
[23:06:51] <ksft> no, but I'm sure there are verbs that do the same thing
[23:06:56] <Guest9> oh i see
[23:06:59] <huf> verbs also become irregular on their own 
[23:07:02] <huf> spontaneously
[23:07:06] <huf> it's super weird
[23:07:25] <ksft> can you give an example from the last few centuries?
[23:08:02] <huf> "shat"
[23:08:07] <ksft> oh, huh
[23:08:13] <huf> it's from the 18th century, by analogy to "sit"
[23:08:20] <huf> apparently :)
[23:08:22] <ksft> there's also the interesting pattern of overirregularization
[23:08:46] <ksft> where people might, for example, inflect "derive" as "derove"
[23:09:17] <ksft> that's probably a production error, so it probably doesn't make sense to call the verb irregular because of it
[23:09:50] <ksft> my point is that there are a lot of reasons you won't be able to get a single 'number of irregular verbs in English'
[23:10:50] <LuisP18> would you consider them participles ending on -en irregular? :3

[23:41:33] <immibis> why do i get the impression StayHungry is just another of those political types who loves to rant about nonexistent problems all the time
[23:41:41] <immibis> I am a native english speaker and I have not had to learn 100 gender identities.
[23:42:12] <TechTest> are they that many?
[23:42:25] <TechTest> they were 5 last time I checked
[23:42:28] <ksft> depends on how you define "gender identity"
[23:42:42] <ksft> there are people who argue that no two people really perceive their gender exactly the same way
[23:42:52] <ksft> and that you can approximate that with labels as precisely as you want
[23:43:02] <StayHungry> immibis: it's called humor. if that line was irritating to your taste, try one above, which caused LuisP18 to laugh
[23:43:09] <TechTest> therefore there are that mang genders as the people that exist in the world
[23:43:52] <ksft> which is (deliberately) effectively the same as getting rid of the entire social construct aspect of gender entirely
[23:44:26] <ksft> lots of people have lots of opinions, including radical ones like that, on lots of subjects
[23:45:11] <immibis> StayHungry: if it was a joke, it was a joke in bad taste.
[23:45:13] <TechTest> I'll start identify as a techgender
[23:45:25] <TechTest> and I will call out anyone who tries to tell me I'm not
[23:45:41] <StayHungry> TechTest: what does it mean? :)
[23:45:55] <immibis> there is no international registry of gender identities, so someone can claim to be whatever they want. whether they can actually feel however they claim is debatable. and you certainly aren't expected to memorize a list of whatever people want
[23:45:58] <TechTest> oh should it mean something?
[23:46:16] <ksft> if your goal is to communicate something by that word, yes
[23:46:29] <ksft> if your goal is to mock nonbinary people, maybe not
[23:47:34] <TechTest> interesting, I wonder what all these people who identify with non existent genders mean by these words
[23:47:54] <ksft> if you're actually curious, you should ask them when they tell you how they identify
[23:49:04] <ksft> (ignoring the obviously loaded "non existent" part of that question)
[23:49:26] <immibis> "I wonder what angry hateful people mean when they name themselves TechTest"
[23:49:51] <TechTest> I was actually kidding, I don't consider my IRC nickname a gender
[23:50:09] <immibis> that was also a joke in bad taste after about line 3
[23:50:22] <immibis> but it was a sliding scale of meh to bad taste
[23:50:28] <Oleg> immibis: are you British? I am asking it because you said "I have not had to learn", instead of "I didn't have to learn".
[23:51:02] <immibis> interesting anyone noticed that, and the answer is no, New Zealandish
[23:51:22] <immibis> it is a bit silly that the only adjective form of New Zealand is "Kiwi"
[23:51:37] <ksft> Oleg: those are different tenses, not the syntactic difference in the usage of the word "have" between British and American English
[23:51:37] <StayHungry> ksft: yeah... nihilism, moral relativism, discarding of authorities, post-modern at its best. :D it's tempting to put on a tinfoil cap and imagine some behind-the-scenes plot in the spirit of Babel to deliberately divide people by adding infinite number of controversial issues (like gender identities) and thereby deprive them of the opportunity to negotiate and move towards global goals 
[23:52:04] <blkshp> Good rugby players! Terrible taste in Marmite.,
[23:52:17] <blkshp> Sanitarium... pfft.
[23:52:40] <TechTest> that's the first time I'll agree with you in terms of food
[23:52:41] <immibis> ksft: but different dialects might have different preferences for one or the other
[23:52:57] <blkshp> Our marmite is much better
[23:53:05] <immibis> like how German uses the "I have Xed" (perfect) form by default instead of "I Xed"
[23:53:13] <immibis> of course, German is not a dialect of English
[23:53:22] <TechTest> no marmite is good
[23:53:28] <ksft> immibis: yes, definitely
[23:53:29] <immibis> vegemite is better
[23:53:38] <blkshp> immibis: you take that back.
[23:53:43] <blkshp> Sick SICK person ;P
[23:53:54] <TechTest> bbq is better
[23:54:00] <immibis> to anyone not from oceania it's still the same black goop that tastes terrible when you eat a spoonful of it
[23:54:15] <TechTest> don't ask me to take that back because you know I won't
[23:54:15] <blkshp> And people actually do that, weirdos!
[23:54:28] <ksft> immibis: I got the sense Oleg might have confused it with the thing in British English where "have" works differently
[23:54:34] <blkshp> bbq is good but you can't spread it thinly on freshly baked bread toast for breakfast.
[23:54:47] <TechTest> blkshp: there's only one weirdo in that channel
[23:56:00] <TechTest> if you spread marmite kind of things on your breakfast toast, that's ehh... 
[23:56:23] <Oleg> ksft: well, an American might say "I have not had time to do that", but "I have no had to learn..." sounds a bit unusual to my ear
[23:58:47] <Oleg> "not", not "no"
