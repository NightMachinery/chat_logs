[14:30:43] <FrostKiwi> Hey there :] If you come across a phishing website or website using typosquatting to deceive, is there anything else you can do, except notify the registrar via mail or letter and ask the domain to be dropped? Is there some authority where you can send a report to?
[14:34:39] *** Joins: atom32k (~atomekk@user/atom32k)

[14:38:57] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[14:39:33] <Apachez> you can notify the owner of the original site
[14:39:49] <Apachez> they probably know about it but at least they can inform their customers
[14:40:27] <Apachez> other than that there is not much you can do... som TLD's supports some "court" where you can make a statement of misuse but thats mainly regarding registered trademarks and such
[14:41:10] <Apachez> like you registerered volvo.se 25 years ago and now last week some phising website came called volvvo.se who uses your brand etc and is obviously to trick your customers to give out personal info or whatever
[14:41:34] <Apachez> but other than paperwork and pay a dispute fee at most that domain is either transfered to you or shutdown
[14:41:42] *** Joins: blindguard (~blindguar@2a02:908:1864:c200::2612)
[14:41:45] <Apachez> and the squatter just registers voolvo.se and you have to redo the process
[14:42:11] *** Quits: cpluspunch_ (~znc@104.200.132.174) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[14:42:16] *** Joins: cpluspunch (~znc@104.200.132.237)
[14:42:23] <Apachez> so inform (in the above example) the true site (volvo.se in this example) unless they already know about it and then volvo.se can file a dispute through the TLD to make a transfer of the squatted domain
[14:42:38] <Apachez> best solution is information to customers
[14:42:44] *** Joins: hudo (~hudo@62.68.20.210)
[14:42:50] <Apachez> other than that its just an neverending cat and rat chase
[14:43:01] <Apachez> next its voollvo, vvolvo and so on
[14:43:16] <Apachez> vol.vo  (see, a different TLD this time)
[14:43:28] *** Joins: hudo_ (~hudo@62.68.20.210)
[14:44:11] *** Quits: HyN0X (~HyNoX@ge-19-124-131.service.infuturo.it) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[14:44:16] <Apachez> transfered to you I meant transfered to the trademark holder if they already got a domain
[14:44:34] <Apachez> but most tld's are relaxed since its first to pay first to serve which is the main rule
[14:44:41] *** Quits: hudo_ (~hudo@62.68.20.210) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:44:57] <Apachez> and unless the "mistyped" site is for obvious illegal use (like using your brand and tricking people into bad things) you will lost a dispute case
[14:45:11] <Apachez> since (so far) freedom of speech is somewhat priotizied
[14:45:46] <Apachez> I mean (to spin the above example) it could be that someone registered volvvo.se to tell people how much they dislike volvo and then volvo.se would lose such dispute case
[14:45:55] *** Joins: HyN0X (~HyNoX@151.35.104.116)
[14:46:11] <Apachez> because the site doesnt try to mimick the original one
[14:46:24] <Apachez> and it obvious that you didnt end up at the volvo site when vising volvvo.se and so on
[14:46:52] <Apachez> previously there were a database online with dispute cases where you can read of the ruling (speaking about the .se TLD)
[14:47:22] <FrostKiwi> Apachez: Thx for the info. So complain to the registrar and contact the original site owner, and that's that. Really interesting to hear about those TLD courts, interesting stuff to go and read up on.

[14:48:32] <secbot> ^ Tvistlösning för Domännamn i Toppdomänen .SE
[14:49:12] <Apachez> so the dispute fee is about $300-1000 depending on who the original owner (making the dispute) is
[14:49:30] <Apachez> so for .se there are three rules to get a favour:
[14:49:53] <Apachez> 1) you must have a company or trademark registered in sweden (with jurisdiction pointing to sweden)
[14:49:55] *** Joins: Nact (~l@host-85-27-120-251.dynamic.voo.be)
[14:50:12] <Apachez> 2) the misuse domain should have done so in "bad faith"
[14:50:34] <Apachez> 3) and that misuse owner shall not have right or interest in the domain name
[14:50:52] <Apachez> someone bad translation of whats written at https://internetstiftelsen.se/domaner/tvistlosning/tvistlosning-for-se-domaner/  so other TLD's might have other rules
[14:50:53] <secbot> ^ Tvistlösning för .se-domäner - ATF - Internetstiftelsen
[14:51:44] <Apachez> here are pending cases and the rulings of previous cases  https://internetstiftelsen.se/domaner/tvistlosning/tvistlosning-for-se-domaner/pagaende-arenden-och-atf-beslut/
[14:51:45] <secbot> ^ Pågående ärenden och ATF-beslut - Internetstiftelsen
[14:52:04] <FrostKiwi> Apachez: Ohh wow, thx for the excellent references!
[14:52:18] <Apachez> for example "skolveret.se, sklverket.se, skolerket.se" which obviously tries to squatt the swedish school system agency (skolverket.se original site)
[14:53:54] <Apachez> or (speaking of volvo :D) a case about "volvfinans.se" who tries to squatt the original site volvofinans.se (who is like the bank section of volvo... if you buy a new volvo but have it on (what its called) like a loan then its volvofinans.se who pay up the full amount to volvo dealer and then you pay an interest fee to volvofinans
[14:55:00] <Apachez> if you scroll down you see "Beslut: Bifall" means approved so the domain was moved to the trademark holder
[14:55:37] <Apachez> while for example "elfgren.se" had "Beslut: Avlag" meaning denied so that domain wasnt moved to however made the dispute
[14:55:50] *** shayne_ is now known as shayne
[14:55:56] <Apachez> here is that elfgren case (as example) https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=DSE2021-0017
[14:55:57] <secbot> ^ WIPO Domain Name Decision: DSE2021-0017
[14:56:38] <Apachez> so a company named Elfgren made a dispute case regarding elfgren.se, when visiting elfgren.se you can see that its for sale
[14:57:09] <Apachez> so first part concludes that the domain is registered in "bad faith"
[14:58:47] *** Joins: s0mbra (jd@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/s0mbra)
[14:59:35] <Apachez> then they conclude it actually isnt in "bad faith" since its the original spelling... the domain was also for some time between 2016 and 2018 unregistered and the one making the dispute didnt register it then
[14:59:55] <Apachez> so the ruling regarding "bad faith" is that it actually isnt
[15:00:41] <Apachez> so looking at the demands for a positive ruling they conclude that the company registrered for "elfgren" wins that part
[15:00:43] <Apachez> so 1/3
[15:00:53] <Apachez> err 1-0
[15:01:16] <Apachez> then they look and conclude regarding bad faith and concludes that it actually isnt because reasons (more than one is named)
[15:01:17] <Apachez> so 1-1
[15:01:43] <Apachez> and then they dont care to make a statement on the third part which must comply before a move is done
[15:01:54] <Apachez> and the disputer must win with 3-0 before the domain is moved
[15:02:31] <Apachez> but I would say its more like 2-1 in this case but since the disputer must have 3-0 to win well the ruling is that they lost their dispute
[15:04:33] <Apachez> while another case like exppressen.se (original site expressen.se - a large swedish tabloid/news magazine) there the disputer won
[15:04:35] <Apachez> https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=DSE2019-0021
[15:04:36] <secbot> ^ WIPO Domain Name Decision: DSE2019-0021
[15:05:12] <Apachez> where a visit to the bad site directed you to a site that looks like a competitor site along with some bitcoin investment stuff etc
[15:05:21] <Apachez> and the claim wasnt replied to by that owner
[15:05:28] <Apachez> so it became a 3-0 win for the disputer
[15:07:55] <Apachez> but again its just a massive cat and mouse game
[15:08:07] <Apachez> you can only do so much to try to protect your trademark or whatever
[15:08:14] <Apachez> best is to inform customers
[15:08:37] <Apachez> because next time someone misspells lets say expressen into exxpressen or expresen or well you get the point here
[15:09:05] <Apachez> piratebay did a thing of this some years ago when they were in peak media
[15:09:22] <Apachez> the anti piracy lobby company in sweden had antipiratbyran.com as their site
[15:09:25] *** Quits: masta`` (~oyster@user/masta/x-2645138) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:09:32] <Apachez> so piratebay registered antipiratbyran.se and put a mailproxy there
[15:09:40] <Apachez> who forwarded the emails to antipiratbyran.com
[15:10:08] <Apachez> so police, lawyers, prosecutors etc mistyped emails with @antipiratbyran.se instead of .com
[15:10:23] <Apachez> and then some months later a large torrent was released with all kind of juice they had picked up
[15:10:25] <Apachez> that was fun :D
[15:10:37] <Apachez> unfortunately only communication in one direction but still :D
[15:11:00] <Apachez> and since emailclients such as outlook automagically caches your first typing that shit continued for some time =)

[18:18:23] <TRS> Hey gang, I'm looking to use advanced machine learning and adv analysis for my windows process monitoring events in my environment.  It seems that using the combination of elasticsearch, logstash and kibani known as the ELK stack is the way to go.   As I'm new to the ELK stack and I'm looking to setup my first system. I know the main components of ELK, but I'm sure I will have many questions
[18:18:23] <TRS> in general about setup and support, questions about getting a new ELK stack up and running. Is this an appropriate channel to use?

[22:18:50] <ajak> it's the responsibility of the caller to pass valid input to strlen
[22:19:10] <ajak> if foo() can't trust its input, it probably shouldn't be passing it itno strlen
[22:22:26] <Klinda> can you tell me how can I write some code to exploit this function for example?
[22:23:11] <ajak> pass it char* without a null terminator
[22:23:26] <Klinda> and then ?
[22:23:31] <Klinda> what should I pass?
[22:23:44] <ajak> a char* without a null terminator
[22:23:54] <Klinda> yes, but how can I become root of the shell
[22:23:55] <ajak> and then you'll get oob memory read
[22:24:34] <ajak> you're not going to get a root shell by triggering an oob read

[22:33:43] <Klinda> then it crash... ?
[22:37:26] <ajak> well, then it will do an oob read, which is undefine behaviour
