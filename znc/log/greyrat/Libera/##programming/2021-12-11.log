[00:13:17] <jeaye> Yeah, that argument doesn't quite make sense.
[00:13:43] <pyzozord> you are missing context. I love video games
[00:14:05] <jeaye> If a game is a toy (which is a huge simplification and reduction of one of the most popular forms of media these days), it would still hold that there could be a "Best game" for people. Just as there's a "best toy" for some people.
[00:14:49] <pyzozord> but I don't think that field is where it should be. it's too commercialized and geared for mass consumption. Doesn't seem very sophisticated or deep
[00:14:57] <andyandyandy> yeah sorry pyzozord i am missing context, my connection flicked
[00:15:02] <jeaye> The problem is that the question itself was underspecified, since "best" alone is subjective. People answered based on a bunch of different metrics. Time spent playing, amount of content, time since creation, etc.
[00:15:09] <nomagno> ^
[00:15:23] <nomagno> Modern videogames are very simplistic
[00:15:35] <jeaye> o.O
[00:15:48] <jeaye> Modern videogames are ridiculously complex.
[00:16:00] <andyandyandy> i think modern video games are more complex than older video games
[00:16:09] <GeDaMo> I suspect nomagno means gameplay rather than implementation
[00:16:33] <jeaye> That can't possibly make sense, given the depth of AI, mechanics, and different systems within these games now.
[00:16:34] <andyandyandy> even so, doing a 360 no-scope is more complex than stepping on a goomba
[00:16:43] <nomagno> ^
[00:16:53] <pyzozord> i guess I hijacked the question to just express that I'd wish the medium of video games evolved to sophisticated interactive experiences. More like art like some really great movies that change you
[00:17:13] <jeaye> When you look at the latest Sims 4 game, with all of the various inputs into a sim's mood and all of the different, tiny things you can do to affect them, it's very complex.
[00:17:14] <andyandyandy> i think those games do exist pyzozord, and video games are also still really young as a medium
[00:17:38] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Yeah, such games do exist.
[00:17:50] <nomagno> I honestly think among AAA devs only Nintendo consistently keeps that gameplay magic, tough in a modernized simplistic form of course
[00:17:59] <vdamewood> The Talos Principle comes to mind.
[00:18:02] <jeaye> When you look at the huge open worlds in games like The Witcher 3, with all of the different paths you can take and things you can do, and balancing that to make it all make sense and remain fair, you can't say it's simplistic.
[00:18:19] <pyzozord> that's true the field is very new and it has very cool shiny thing called technogy, it will take time before we can look past that
[00:18:25] <vdamewood> Undertale
[00:18:35] <pyzozord> yes there might be some exceptions. actually if you know those please do share
[00:18:49] <nomagno> jeaye: I can say it focuses on the story more than the gameplay
[00:18:52] <user51> pyzozord: what games o you play
[00:19:09] <jeaye> When you look at the ridiculously huge skill ceiling of a game like Rocket League, which allows first-time players to jump in and drive around, but also pros who have thousands of hours of gameplay to perform mechanics that the noobs wouldn't even realize are possible, all using the game car and same controller, you can't say this is simplistic.
[00:19:23] <nomagno> Games shouldn't sacrifice one for the other
[00:19:27] <jeaye> It takes the mechanics and skill ceiling of something like Quake 3 and blows it out of the water.
[00:19:50] <andyandyandy> yeah i thinik that's a compelling aspect, that if you create complex systems you can allow for complex gameplay
[00:19:55] <andyandyandy> through emergent behavior

[00:20:36] <jeaye> You made a very general statement. Not me.
[00:20:53] <nomagno> I don't agree Rocket League necessarily has a higher skill ceiling than Quake tough, but that has nothing to do with Quake being old :P

[00:21:23] <andyandyandy> it forces people to
[00:21:46] <nomagno> I see a trend of games getting more and more complex and more and more realistic while having shakey foundations. Complex systems don't mean replayability

[01:02:08] <nomagno> The core semantics are definitely opinionated, it's not a clean slate like many other systems programming langs
[01:02:38] <nomagno> The borrow checker is a novel concept, but they seemed to base the entire language about having a sane way to work around it
[01:03:02] <pyzozord> i still believe that answer to all memory problems is stack. There should be no heap at all
[01:03:39] <pyzozord> you can simulate your own miniheaps on the stack but they will go away when function finishes

[01:24:47] <average> zardoz: he will counter you for sure. That’s what nomagno does, he has arguments from his position as an ignoramus
[01:26:08] <nomagno> It means the behavior is not defined. The C and C++ standards might make a distinction between defined, unspecified, implementation-defined, and undefined. Generally UB is fundamentally included to give leeway to implementors, platforms, or simply because no one's sure/not everyone agrees what should go there.
[01:26:35] <average> nomagno: listen, every language that’s been around for a long time, and with a very active committee.. is a huge source of problems.

[01:53:46] <MrMobius> [itchyjunk], and Java is interpreted which doesnt always mean worse performance but in this case has
[01:54:00] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: Java compiles to bytecode that must run in a VM runtime environment on top of the OS, which is a huge contributor to relative slowness, high resource consumption, and poor access to hardware.

[01:54:25] <nomagno> The JVM has a case to be made for
[01:54:31] <[itchyjunk]> apotheon, oh i had mentioned that earlier and asked if the jvm was the cause
[01:54:32] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: C++ compiles to a binary executed directly on the OS, works well with assembly when needed, and so on.
[01:54:35] <[itchyjunk]> okay so it makes sense
[01:54:37] <CaCode> why be anti-semetic about?
[01:54:39] <nomagno> average: You ever seen a draft?
[01:54:43] <[itchyjunk]> yeah c++ compiles to machine code
[01:54:44] *** bayaz sets mode: +b $a:average
[01:54:44] *** average was kicked by bayaz (average)
[01:54:46] <MrMobius> [itchyjunk], yes and any type of bytecode is going to be slower than native code which is what C++ generates
[01:54:46] <CaCode> uncalled for
[01:55:10] <nomagno> Some people haven't seen a draft
[01:55:27] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: The JVM takes a while to spin up, then it has to load the program, which is significant for effects on startup time.
[01:55:38] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i wonder why byte code is necessarely slower though
[01:55:40] <CaCode> You can compile java like c++
[01:55:44] <[itchyjunk]> i wonder if it's something obvious that i am not seeing
[01:55:48] <CaCode> the issue is not with Java the language
[01:55:58] <CaCode> but with the whole jvm ordeal, no?
[01:56:00] <MrMobius> [itchyjunk], its like reading a book in english vs reading a book in a language you dont understand and pausing to look each word up in the dictionary
[01:56:12] <nomagno> apotheon: The JVM is probably eh, decent for portability? admittedly I find C encoded in ASCII to be a more performant code storage method that .jar s :D
[01:56:22] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: The high overhead is because the JVM itself takes up a lot of system resources, on top of which you have to deal with a program running on the JVM that is written using a language that uses indirection everywhere -- adding more complexity to actual runtime code, slowing things down further.
[01:56:23] <[itchyjunk]> apotheon, when i run a standalone java application, the jvm spins up. if i run another application, does it use the same jvm?
[01:56:24] <nomagno> and usually more portable if you're careful
[01:56:34] <[itchyjunk]> another java application
[01:56:57] <[itchyjunk]> MrMobius, idk if that is accurate
[01:57:14] <[itchyjunk]> as far as the java compiler is concerned, jvm is the machine it's compiling to
[01:57:24] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: Bytecode is slower because it has to be executed by an interpreting process somehow, rather than just being native to the OS+hardware.
[01:57:32] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well a bytecode program needs to be run by another program, and that other program has to be implemented some way.  You just have an extra layer between you and the machine. 
[01:57:47] <apotheon> In Java's case, that process is the JVM (which is actually many processes, speaking of resource overhead).
[01:57:47] <[itchyjunk]> right, the extra layer makes sense
[01:58:03] <[itchyjunk]> so following that, how did they manage to make minecraft in java?
[01:58:06] <bjs> does having an extra layer absolutely mean it will go slower? not necessarily, but interpreters are quite a fat layer that do a lot of work, so in this case, usually yes
[01:58:07] <[itchyjunk]> it has a lot of objects
[01:58:11] <MrMobius> [itchyjunk], yes and JVM does not exist in the hardware of your PC. your PC is running a simulation of the non existent (ie virtual) JVM processor. simulation has overhead and slows things down
[01:58:21] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: i'm not sure how that follows
[01:58:23] <CaCode> [itchyjunk], very low resolution
[01:58:25] <CaCode> :P
[01:58:45] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: would minecraft run faster if it was all implemented in C instead and written properly and well? Probably.  Does it matter? Not really, Java was apparently "fast enough" 
[01:59:02] <apotheon> CaCode: The Java language itself is so abstracted from the underlying machine that it necessarily has more complexity involved in how it boils down to bytecode, or even to binary if you write something in Java that can be compiled to a binary somehow.
[01:59:15] <bjs> (+ 3d video games are full of fun and complicated optimizations to make things manageable)
[01:59:17] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[01:59:32] <apotheon> CaCode: You'd pretty much have to include a runtime as part of the binary compilation, kinda like Go but worse because Java wasn't designed with that in mind.
[01:59:36] <flakland> axis aligned box craft
[01:59:37] <MrMobius> ya minecraft is java and they had exactly this problem when people started running their own servers. the performance wasnt good enough for some of the stuff they needed to do so they started rewriting in C#
[01:59:39] <[itchyjunk]> what was the type of coq? it was not fully typed apparently.. there was some special word
[01:59:52] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: "fully typed" what do you mean?
[01:59:57] <bjs> are you looking for "dependently typed"
[01:59:57] <[itchyjunk]> rewriting in C# came later
[02:00:03] <[itchyjunk]> they managed to run large servers in java
[02:00:21] <[itchyjunk]> oh it was dependently typed yes
[02:00:22] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: I'm not sure how the JVM groups things together, but each separate Java program will need some amount of segregated runtime environment.
[02:00:32] <nomagno> Android accepts Java, but it admittedly only accepts a specific format to allow for pre-compilation
[02:00:35] <MrMobius> right but they hit the performance wall for the stuff they were doing later. ie if they had written it in C++ from the beginning, they wouldnt have had that problem

[02:03:52] <apotheon> bjs: Sure, but that's a layer that sacrifices up-front time to get better runtime performance, which is a trade-off rather than a straight-up improvement, and its benefit is only relative to how slow it would be otherwise rather than relative to a binary compiled equivalent.

[04:05:59] <apotheon> Every time I've tried Pringles, I felt like I should like them, but I didn't.
[04:06:19] <apotheon> . . . so I'd stop after two or three, when I gave up on the idea that I should like them.
[04:06:24] <pyzozord> there is something nasty about all the highly processed foods like this
[04:06:53] <pyzozord> but then you must have the same attitude towards cola

[04:07:07] <KillerWasp> hello
[04:07:16] <edgar-rft> apotheon: but you continued eating pringles while hating them?
[04:07:30] <apotheon> I like a good cola.
[04:07:35] <KillerWasp> i hate all freelance works: Everyone is abuzz with desperate idiots yelling and slamming the counter for free voucher tickets for leftover meals. Everything is too insane. Running to be slaves for a couple of beans.
[04:07:38] <apotheon> Mexican Pepsi is quite good.
[04:08:03] <apotheon> edgar-rft: The first one is always "Umm . . . do I like this?  I'm not sure what's going on here.  I need to try another."
[04:08:10] <apotheon> The second is "I don't think I like this."
[04:08:22] <apotheon> Sometimes, I think ". . . but I'm not sure, so I'll try one more."
[04:08:44] <apotheon> I've only had Pringles four times in the last 35ish years, and that's how it was each time.
[04:08:54] <KillerWasp> I really don't get it. How can so much masochism be so moved (or productive)? Everyone likes.
[04:09:23] <edgar-rft> there is no "first one always", there's only *one* first one, and no other first one after that :-)
[04:09:36] <apotheon> It's weird in that at first it just seems like something isn't right, but it's not immediately terrible.

[04:10:10] <apotheon> . . . and have none.
[04:10:15] <edgar-rft> I'm also not immediately terrible, but... :-)
[04:10:57] <apotheon> With an average time span of twelve years between times I try Pringles, it shouldn't be a surprise that I got suckered in a couple more times.
[04:11:16] <KillerWasp> I always end up wasting my time on those junk freelance sites. And I remember why I gave it up in the first place.
[04:11:43] <apotheon> By now, though, I think the only way I'd eat Pringles is if there's some additional factor motivating it, like being paid a lot of money to eat them or literally starving.

[04:13:20] <pyzozord> i recently made sandwiches with pringles, I wanted to try out sanwitches with chips
[04:13:46] <pyzozord> i never ate that before I always though it doesn't make sense to put chips in your sandwiches
[04:14:02] <pyzozord> it's ok, but not amazing and still doesn't make sense :P
[04:14:48] <apotheon> shoulda tried good chips
[04:15:04] <apotheon> It still might not make sense, but it'd be tastier.
[04:15:38] <apotheon> You could just butter-fry some homemade tortilla pieces to make tortilla chips.  That seems like a tasty thing to have.
[04:15:46] <pyzozord> yeah could be, but meh, might as well do normal sandwches

[04:17:49] <pyzozord> that's all my programming thoughts for today
[04:18:09] <apotheon> I'd just like to have the fried tortilla pieces.  I'm trying to convince the missus to make tortillas and fry them in butter with garlic and black pepper.
[04:18:23] <apotheon> eww, onions

[04:18:46] <[itchyjunk]> Even in poor country, it's not reliable
[04:18:46] <apotheon> Yeah, upwork is for places with very low wages.

[04:55:16] <apotheon> Proof of work is providing proof (in the form of solved hashes) of having performed a bunch of calculations.  Proof of stake is basically just putting up a number of cryptocurreny units above a particular threshold that you lose if the network decides you're confirming things that shouldn't be confirmed.

[04:55:36] <InPhase> apotheon: I don't think it's too exceptional.  You just need to build up a recognized good skill set so you can be selective about where you work, and then on top of that pay a lot of attention when job seeking to what kind of people are selected to work at that place, and how management deals with both hiring and problematic behavior.
[04:55:46] <pyzozord> proof of stake is just "rich guys get the vote"
[04:55:49] <apotheon> PoS is basically a voting system that punishes you for voting "maliciously" (according to majority results) by taking some of your cryptocurrency.
[04:56:13] <[itchyjunk]> apotheon, so i put some stake and then what? i just make money while verifying things?
[04:56:20] <[itchyjunk]> the whole mining thing is gone?
[04:56:25] <pyzozord> s/get the vote/can vote"
[04:56:35] <apotheon> The big problem with PoS is that it much more directly incentivizes power for the already-powerful.

[04:57:27] <apotheon> 18:25 < pyzozord> proof of stake is just "rich guys get the vote"
[04:57:35] <apotheon> in a nutshell, yes, pyzozord has it nailed down
[04:57:45] <[itchyjunk]> yeah that doesn't seem like the best of things to me
[04:57:56] <pyzozord> my problem with proof of stake is that's it's easier to abuse, in both proof of work and proof of stake you need money to abuse the system, but in proof of work you also need time to aquire the miners set it all up etc
[04:58:01] <[itchyjunk]> but must be some reason since eth and friends are moving to it
[04:58:04] <pyzozord> in proof of stake it's immediate
[04:58:22] <apotheon> 18:27 < InPhase> apotheon: Well sort of, except it's not really power.  They can't do anything but the right thing or they're penalized.
[04:58:27] <apotheon> "the right thing" is the majority thing
[04:58:27] <InPhase> apotheon: I think the ratio isn't too bad, and it exists on a spectrum, but that it's easy to get trapped in a rut of clashing with problematic people if you're not one of the ones actively hunting for the places which are run okay.
[04:58:31] <[itchyjunk]> maybe there is enough work for everyone though
[04:58:59] <apotheon> . . . which will tend to be whatever makes the wealthy even wealthier, except in cases where math is the only constant, but if it was all math it'd be back to PoW

[09:20:49] <moose> RE: conversation about freelancing - Guest80 and friends here
[09:21:01] <moose> It's harder but more rewarding - find a way to generate passive income
[09:21:49] <moose> If you're in the US, form a corporation and don't hire yourself as an employee. You can take distributions that are qualified as taxable in the US but only once and not taxable outside of the US. You can source your money that way, travel the world, and not have to deal with work visas, employment sponsorship, or double taxation
[09:22:54] <moose> But that only works if you are NOT freelancing. If you are freelancing and working in another country, odds are you'll need a work permit, a local company to sponsor you (yes even in thailand where expats flock to for cheap luxury living), and it's a pain in the ass
[09:24:23] <moose> But if you're already loaded and want to settle down into one country, look for financial advantage visas, sometimes called elite visas or something to that effect. Usually they let you work and are very long duration but require some cash to get ($20k USD equivalent in most places for each 5-15 years)
[09:24:37] <moose> Anyway just my $0.11 (inflation, it was originally $0.02)

[09:28:34] <Guest80> moose: didnt know about financial advantage visas thats interesting. if you form a corporation (non employee) in country of your choice are you saying, you can sponsor yourself or?
[09:29:13] <Guest80> my ultimate goal is to form a corporation but I dont know how to go from freelancing to corporation 
[09:29:52] <moose> I dunno where you reside, but as a US citizen you are taxed globally on your income at the same rate as you would be in the US - sort of. There's limits. But basically if you work in say Canada, you'll pay Canada taxes plus US taxes up to the amount equal in the US as if you had been in the US all along.

[09:30:28] <moose> But say you simply are a businessperson, you run your company in the US, and your company earns income. They pay you distributions from the US, to your US bank account, and the income is recurring and automatic. Like a website with a service, for example.
[09:30:40] <moose> That income is only taxed in the US now, and not declared outside of it, even if you reside in a second country part time.

[09:32:38] <Guest80> o ok that makes sense 
[09:32:47] <moose> Just never register your company in the same country you want to live in.

[09:38:08] <Guest80> moose: do you got any tips on going from lone freelancer to starting a successful SaaS or corporation? 
[09:38:50] <moose> Absolutely. The best advice I can give is pick something you're passionate about, not what you think will just generate massive income. You can do something that has been done before and just do it so much better that there's no point in staying with a competitor.
[09:39:09] <moose> Competitors usually have advantages like longevity, reputation, strong market holds, or first mover advantage... but brand new tech can disrupt the heck out of those.
[09:39:54] <moose> The hardest part is not coming up with an idea, in my opinion. It's really just sticking it out. You have to go all-in on an idea, dedicate all of your spare time to it, really do it hard. And do 100% like that for at a minimum of 3 months before you even make a decision as to if it's going to be good or not long-term.
[09:40:14] *** Quits: constxd (~brad@142.134.38.68) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[09:40:45] <moose> The hardest business you will build is your first successful one. The easiest ones are the ones that fail early and you learn from. Those are invaluable learning experiences but sometimes the feeling of failure can offset your motivation; don't let it fuck with you.
[09:41:50] <Guest80> ok thanks this is gold im taking notes. appreciate it bro
[09:41:56] <moose> Also don't take advice from your family basically, unless they're successful business founders of course.
[09:42:18] <moose> But if they happen to be a potential customer, listen to their problems in detail. Always listen to people who have problems with something, because it means there may be something you can do about it and profit from.

[09:44:30] <ent58> I've looked into how one would solve the housing problem where I live, and the unfortunate part is that it's mostly due to zoning grift :/
[09:44:43] <moose> Little stuff like that can turn into big ideas. Remember that stuff like Uber sounded really idiotic initially, or exclusive to rich people.

[09:45:20] <moose> ent58: Right so in this case, a non-profit tax-advantaged business that creates programs to help re-zone areas could be a massive tax shelter and generate income, receive grants, all kinds of stuff.
[09:45:45] <ent58> That's the way I wanted to go, but it takes a lot of capital to get that moving
[09:45:59] *** Quits: lockywolf (~lockywolf@vultr-seoul-openbsd.lockywolf.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:46:15] <moose> Right, which is why if you have none then you use skills you have. If you're a programmer, you have tons of things you can do in that same area to get the initial funds over time.
[09:46:21] <ent58> Also, isn't Uber only really afloat because they know how to gracefully receive VC funds? The "rideshare" division at least
[09:46:51] *** Joins: lockywolf (~lockywolf@vultr-seoul-openbsd.lockywolf.net)
[09:46:59] <moose> There's a reason VCs funded it. They didn't just get donations. VCs funded it because they wanted huge returns. But the VCs were not the initial funders, it was primarily private investors dropping as little as $10,000 to get percentage share of the entire company.
[09:47:03] <Guest80> ent58: i think affordable housing is getting to a very very fundamental problem in society but issue is, house cant be both an investment (an asset) and affordable i.e. it cant both yield more than average rate of inflation (investment) and be affordable (be under average rate of inflation)
[09:47:17] <Guest80> moose: what do you think of crypto startups? 
[09:47:32] <ent58> crypto anything is a symptom of the disease to be honest
[09:47:35] <ent58> but
[09:48:10] <moose> Guest80: It's a hard industry to break in to right now because of so much diffusion in the good/bad and that the general public is still quite wary. But if you can capitalize on not necessarily a crypto business that leverages crypto directly but rather something that enables those technologies, you're going to come out with higher chances of success I think

[09:52:07] <ent58> The issue I have with anything cryptocurrency related is that as it stands right now, it is a speculative investment of perhaps the worst possible kind. Even if newer cryptocurrencies are not proof-of-work based and therefore not a huge net drain on electrical resources, there's really no honest-to-goodness point to them AT ALL other than sell it
[09:52:07] <ent58> to a sucker who sells to another sucker who sold to another
[09:52:16] <moose> Guest80: Since I only really know about US law in this area... basically my advice there is limited to that context. But you can essentially make a business that provides services and uses cryptocurrency to do it, or allows you to create crypto related things without becoming a money transmitter and without becoming an exchange or offering a security
[09:52:56] <moose> ent58: That's the same argument for any fiat currency, futures, bonds, stocks, any security essentially and including real estate.
[09:53:15] <namkeleser> Anyone?
[09:53:17] <Guest80> moose: ok good to know. I figured exchanges, etc. were a grey area but my idea was more on the tech / infrastructure side of things

[09:57:11] <moose> If I buy gold or I buy bitcoin, they're both speculative. Is one worse than the other? Not really right now. Cryptocurrencies largely have outperformed any other investment type in the last 10 years pretty much at all stages.
[09:57:25] <ent58> Those huge returns are functionally huge fish FOMO'ing the small investor and pulling out the rug when the hype reaches max.
[09:57:32] <moose> Is it a bubble? Probably. Are there massive risks? With any investment, there is risk.
[09:58:10] <moose> ent58: Not usually anymore. Perhaps in smaller altcoins, yes. But you could've sat on say Ethereum for the last 3 years and had significant returns without any rug pulls.

[13:40:08] <mrig> deniska yes they are, this just seems somewhat more fundamental than that somehow.
[13:40:54] <arahael> deniska: Personally, I think Go already abuses stuff by say, doing their timespans the way they are so that you can sort of have appropriate operators.
[13:41:07] <arahael> deniska: So easy to end up with a non-sensical timespan.
[13:41:08] <mrig> You can use methods easily for this, but then it ends up looking like lisp, the operators are kind of nice for coding vector stuff.
[13:41:30] <deniska> namkeleser: sha1 sums are compared via == which does funky things with coercion and may compare equal different hashes?
[13:41:43] <arahael> mrig: In Haskell, as an example, operators are no different to functions.

[13:44:00] <mrig> setting the syntactic sugar levels is certainly an art.

[14:15:58] <mrig> now, how this is manageable when investigating time, depends entirely upon the importance that you put on the rotation, in night and day.

[15:05:21] <DarkSky> so im not too experienced with C. if theres `requests` in Python, like `requests.get("website.com")`, how can i do it with C?
[15:05:36] <beaky> so day 9 is a 2d input rather than a 1d input
[15:05:51] <beaky> now i must formalize and prove 2d arrays in coq
[15:06:01] <beaky> i mean agda
[15:06:11] <merijn> DarkSky: well, probably libcurl, but that's gonna be a hell of a lot more painful :p
[15:06:28] <DarkSky> what about cpp?
[15:06:32] <decker> I woulda said libcurl
[15:06:38] <decker> same really :) 
[15:07:02] <merijn> cpp is ambiguous and you should probably not use that as abbreviation for C++ (which I assume you meant)
[15:07:08] <DarkSky> i just want to make a simple system to check a string on a website, if its the same as the users input it outputs `true`, else `false`

[15:11:31] <DarkSky> K&R? whats that
[15:11:34] <beaky> what book do we read to learn enterprise-grade c
[15:11:50] <DarkSky> i just remember reading some book about exploits that had something with C
[15:12:14] <swp> @merijn Really? I thought that was the /de fact/ for learning C.
[15:12:35] <merijn> K&R was written in the era of "a handful of people writing code for a handful of machines". Almost none of the examples in K&R deal with security and the level of paranoia needed to write C in "the real world"
[15:12:39] <merijn> swp: It is

[15:15:32] <merijn> tbh, I don't really have good book recommendation. I was taught with K&R + syllabus. But after TAing students who learned that way for 5 years, I concluded that that (on average) clearly doesn't produce people capable of writing safe C >.>

[15:17:09] <swp> merijn: That makes sense. But I guess you have to start somewhere. If you come from a language like Python, maybe K&R can be a good stepping stone. If you'd have to deal with secirity from the get go, that might be too scary for some people.

[15:19:50] <mrig> I'd argue that C introduces also the warts as well as the sugar, and that this is a good thing.
[15:19:50] <swp> merijn: Ideally, that's true for any language.
[15:19:58] <merijn> mrig: If you write code that touches the network, sure
[15:20:13] <mrig> few do when starting out though.
[15:20:16] <merijn> swp: tbh, there are almost no languages that require that to the extent C does, though
[15:20:26] <mrig> networking is pretty hard and complicated stuff.
[15:20:39] <swp> merijn:  True
[15:20:48] <average> what do you mean by "networking" though.. it could mean anything
[15:20:57] <mrig> learning about the reality with out the stabilisers is a good thing too.
[15:21:01] <merijn> mrig: I consider myself a pretty good and pretty paranoid C programmer. I feel pretty sure I've never written any piece of C >200 lines that does not have at least 3 potential security issues
[15:21:38] <merijn> mrig: If you write Python or Java, that's much less the case and the biggest security issue is generally just "bug crashes the code" (well, unless you use log4j, lol)
[15:21:56] <mrig> merijn if you are coding graphics for fun though, there is nothing to worry about other than the language making you a better programmer.

[17:23:20] <nomagno> I know how it works. I don't really think it is appropiate tough, because I can't possibly know if the system the VM will run on has a different char size, and hence the offset would be bad. Some implementations might even have CHAR_MAX that force me to figure out some kind of algorithm to decide what the best middle point for the offset it
[17:23:31] <nomagno> /UCHAR_MAX
[17:24:24] <GeDaMo> Do you want your VM to have variable size values or are they always going to be 8 bit?

[20:17:22] <vdamewood> nomagno: The wiring gets complex the more finely you try to arrange things.
[20:17:55] <vdamewood> It takes two wires to do things in 16kB chunks, for example. three wires for 8kB chunks, and so on.

[20:19:24] <nomagno> honestly, the CPU register think is probably not necessary for a VM. I did it go gain experience on a few thingies
[20:19:25] <vdamewood> Ah, the CPU I plan on using has 3 internal registers, so no memory-mapped registers.

[20:20:01] <GeDaMo> 6502?
[20:20:15] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: Yeah, The instruction set looks nice enough.
[20:20:29] <vdamewood> No mul or div, but other than that, it's a nifty 8-bit machine.
[20:20:38] <GeDaMo> 6502 had a special zero page addressing mode
[20:20:41] <nomagno> FFFF - ZF, FFFE - CF, FFFD - Input, FFFC - Output
[20:21:03] <GeDaMo> So you could use the first 256 bytes as something like regsiters
[20:21:19] <vdamewood> Oh, interesting.
[20:21:30] <vdamewood> I guess that explains why the stack started at 0x100.

[20:22:41] <vdamewood> One thing that's kind of irritating about the 6502 though, is that it hard codes meaning in address 0x100 to 0x1FF and 0xFFFA - 0xFFFF.
[20:23:12] <vdamewood> So I *have* to put the RAM at 0x0000 - wherever, and I have to put the boot ROM at 0xFFFF - wherever.
[20:24:31] <leonardus> vdamewood: N64 and GameCube do something similar, iirc 0xC___ is uncached access to memory and 0x8___ is cached
[20:24:33] <GeDaMo> Now you don't have to agonise over those decisions! :P
[20:25:39] <GeDaMo> It's pretty common for CPUs to have a reset address where they start running code from
[20:26:10] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: 0xFFFC on the 6502
[20:26:25] <vdamewood> Well, that address is actually read as an address to jmp to.
[20:26:34] <nomagno> I have a fairly unconventional way of doing an almost-pure-Harvard architecture, specifically: Code memory -> Instructions, registers/arguments, callstack ||| Data memory -> 0000-3FFF (RAM), 4000-5FFF (CPU registers), 6000-DFFF (Persistent R/W memory), FFFC (Output), FFFD (Input), FFFE (carry flag), FFFF (zero flag) ||| Instruction set -> {halt, nop, set, jmp, jcz, add, sub, and, or, xor, not, cmp, subs (subroutine START), sube (subroutine
[20:26:34] <nomagno> END), call}
[20:26:56] <vdamewood> So, if you set 0xFFFC to 0x00, and oxFFFD to 0x80, then the 6502 will jmp to 0x8000 to begin execution.
[20:27:10] <GeDaMo> Boot vector
[20:27:29] <vdamewood> Ben Eater called it a reset vector, but yeah.
[20:27:35] <GeDaMo> Yeah, that's it
[20:27:36] <vdamewood> (Same thing)
[20:27:47] <nomagno> And the VM implementation also defines data types for rational numbers tough does not implement them. Rational numbers are three contiguous bytes that contain, in order: Numerator, Denominator, Sign bit

[20:29:19] <nomagno> I don't really have a better place to put the callstack than code memory.
[20:29:23] <vdamewood> I kind of want to implement replacible ROMs on my computer, like video game cartridges.

[20:30:22] <vdamewood> *boot ROM
[20:30:26] <nomagno> assuming the callstack was its own separate chip, my computer has read-only code disks and r/w data disks
[20:30:46] <nomagno> The 'ROM' that contains the code is, practically speaking, the file that contains the assembly :P

[20:49:43] <pyzozord> oh so the only difference is really that "memory mapped video" has to store entire screenworth of pixels, and serial interface to a tty uses a small buffer which can be just few symbols and assumes that the tty has enough memory to hold a screenworth of symbols

[20:54:04] <vdamewood> So, if I wanted to make utility functions on  the boot ROM, but I wanted to be able to rewrite the boot ROM, would a jmp table work for the utility functions?
[20:54:40] <GeDaMo> Almost like an API :P
[20:54:44] <vdamewood> So, I could say that the foo function is at 0x8050, and then at 0x8050, there's a jmp instruction to the actual function.
[20:55:19] <vdamewood> That way, if I need to move the function to somewhere else in a revised ROM, I don't have to patch all the other ROMS.

[22:33:07] <dodo> clean code is a prerequisite, to me anyway
[22:33:13] <nomagno> You also have Kotlin, Clojure, and a bunch of other languages that compile to the JVM
[22:33:15] <dodo> code is read far more often than written
[22:33:42] <nomagno> teut: Because those errors are thrown by the JVM implementation, which is usually just Oracle's and doesn't change
[22:34:13] <nomagno> Or, might be thrown by the Java libs
[22:34:28] <teut> oh right, I should have thought that way
[22:34:34] <nomagno> in either case, Clojure doesn't need to be 'written in Java'. It COULD be
[22:34:35] <nomagno> if you really wanted to
[22:34:44] <teut> now java is also totally revamped
[22:36:17] <nomagno> In this case, Clojure is written 50% in Java and 50% in Clojure.

[23:54:54] <pulse> Does anyone know a tool that can split a GIF into multiple PNGs for each frame, and then do the reverse as well and glue them back into a GIF
[23:55:37] <GeDaMo> imagemagik?
[23:55:50] <pyzozord> ffmpeg i believe can do one of those things
[23:56:00] <phogg> imagemagick will indeed do it, but so will GIMP
[23:56:09] <pyzozord> but I did it last time with imagemagic
[23:56:24] <pulse> Yeah someone mentioned imagemagik before. I'll try that, thanks
[23:56:44] <pulse> phogg, Is there a way to automate it in GIMP? I know you can do it manually, but I have to do it for ~60 images
[23:57:47] <phogg> pulse: there is, it's called script-fu. It can even be triggered from the command line
[23:58:12] <phogg> pulse: https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Batch/
[23:58:13] <bayaz> Title: GIMP - GIMP Batch Mode 
[23:58:27] <pulse> Hmm
[23:58:44] <pulse> Tnx
[23:58:49] <pulse> I'll play with imagemagick first
[23:58:52] <phogg> you have to learn some lisp, although maybe by now they support other languages
[23:59:02] <pulse> There's Python-fu too
