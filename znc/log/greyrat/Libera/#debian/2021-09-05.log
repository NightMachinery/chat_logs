[01:15:20] <velix> I'm running KVM-VMs on a VPS (host is also KVM) using nested virtualizatio (SVG flag is set). On Buster with kernels up to 5.6, anything works fine. Starting with Kernel 5.7, I'm getting 100% usage on all KVM machines and lockups within seconds. But on Bullseye, I'm getting those lockups starting with Kernel 5.4 (Ubuntu Mainline, selfbuild Vanilla and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).

[02:29:31] <Payam> For me was to get better in English. Being able to speak and read english really helps.

[10:17:50] <somiaj> no_gravity: You most likely also want a window manager, otherwise you can't really have more than a single window and very little control over it
[10:18:19] <somiaj> as for window managers there are lots of choices, I'm a fan of fvwm and it is fairly slim, though it is very extensive to customize. Others will have other suggestions, i3 is quite popular
[10:19:12] *** loki_val is now known as crabbedhaloablut
[10:20:35] <somiaj> I would perosnally suggest installing xserver-xorg just because it will install all the drivers you need, though you could install xserver-xorg-core and just the drivers you need. Then you need to install a window manager, and you'll need to install xinit (so you can run xinit or startx)

[10:27:47] <Blondie101010> conclusion:  making it slim is an extra effort with limited benefit
[10:28:44] <Blondie101010> if all you use a GUI for is a text editor, I'd suggest you learn a command line editor
[10:29:38] <no_gravity> somiaj: I am looking for a "one cute little command" solution. Atm I am using just "apt install firefox-esr". But that needs 700MB.
[10:30:06] <Blondie101010> very tight on disk space or what?
[10:30:20] <no_gravity> Blondie101010: It is for an example on how to run a graphical application inside docker.
[10:30:46] <Blondie101010> with X, you just need to set DISPLAY properly
[10:31:00] <Blondie101010> but X needs to be running
[10:31:51] <no_gravity> My current approach is two fold:
[10:32:07] <no_gravity> On the host: docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY --net=host -v $XAUTHORITY:/root/.Xauthority -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix debian:11-slim
[10:32:23] <no_gravity> In the container: apt update; apt install firefox-esr; firefox
[10:32:29] <no_gravity> Now Firefox runs inside the container and you can use it.
[10:32:31] <somiaj> ahh this is just for a test, I'm unsure a good app that will pull everything in, but you might need to install the app and the xserver, as the apps often only depend on the libaries not the server itself
[10:32:49] <somiaj> I know if you do 'apt install fvwm xinit' it should work
[10:33:10] <somiaj> though I'd also add xterm to the list
[10:33:31] <Blondie101010> no_gravity:  I don't see where the problem is...  you basically gave the exact commands to what I told you
[10:33:34] <somiaj> but I don't know of any single grapchiall app which is slim and will install everytying needed to run x
[10:33:35] <Blondie101010> what's the problem?
[10:34:03] <no_gravity> Blondie101010: This pulls in 700mb. I was thinking maybe there is a slimmer approach.
[10:34:20] <Blondie101010> 700MB for firefox is probably quite small
[10:34:23] <somiaj> though also looks like Blondie101010 has a better idea what you are trying to do, sounds like you don't need the full xserver since you are using your local one
[10:34:55] <somiaj> install a simple texteditor then like vim-gtk3
[10:35:27] <somiaj> or just one of the silly old X apps like x11-apps and run xeys
[10:38:12] <Blondie101010> no_gravity:  if your concern is with bandwidth, then an option could be to set up a debian mirror
[10:38:55] <no_gravity> Blondie101010: Nah, this is just a 2-liner I posted on a forum so people can see how to run a graphical app in a container.
[10:39:22] <no_gravity> And I thought "Hmm.. now everyone will download 700mb"
[10:39:46] <Blondie101010> I can imagine some potential benefits to doing that, but more complications

[19:57:08] <Blondie101010> so lazyness can not be the reason
[19:57:10] <amacater> You have two options for the installer : you can use the standard Debian installer - say from the netinst available from www.debian.org or from the debian-live.

[20:01:51] <Blondie101010> fine
[20:04:02] <incal> amacater, so you can't dd the installer onto the SSD and install on the same medium, or even better, dd a rudimentary system directly onto it? I think that what happened with Raspbian and ev3dev, don't remember the process exactly tho ...

[20:04:56] <PerfDave> If you have Debian or another Linux on your HDD, you could try installing Debian 11 onto your SDD using "debootstrap", but it's not exactly a beginner technique.
[20:04:58] <amacater> Right: Raspbian and other ARM based stuff often provide just a bootable image

[20:05:41] *** Joins: pert (~pert@fsf/member/pert)
[20:06:06] <amacater> For Debian in general on amd64 - use an installer - which you can dd onto a USB stick to boot from - go through an install process and end up with a fully installed system.

[20:08:25] <incal> PerfDave, debootstrap, OK, interesting
[20:08:28] <Blondie101010> you can do that on your SSD if you want, but that's a bad idea
[20:08:45] <amacater> No - everyone's needs differ: if you take the Debian netinst - it's an installer only, that then produces a fully populated system by downloading packages.

[20:19:16] <PMT> incal: the point is that if you're not going to get that much benefit from doing the more complex thing of moving your install over, then don't bother, just do a regular new install?
[20:20:15] <amacater> incal: dd is a one liner where you are using a prepared image. So - one of the Raspberry Pi OS bootable images / copying a Debian netinst image to a USB to boot. There isn't a "standard" Debian install golden image for amd64 - instead, there's using an install medium to connect to the network, allow you to make package selections, pull in packages, install GRUB to make the disk bootable
[20:20:46] <OsteHovel> Just a tough, if you use UEFI and lets say you dd your drive (with boot) to another disk and remove the first disk, will it even boot? I know it boots if you use bios/old school booting
[20:20:51] <incal> PMT, yes but I've done that so many times ... not interesting and beside this method is better IMO (or could be better) since it is Debian to Debian if you follow, instead of Debian to nothing to Debian
[20:21:07] <de-facto> Blondie101010, its this here, impossible to paste on paste.debian.net https://bpa.st/ONYQ
[20:21:28] <Blondie101010> OsteHovel: if you fix grub, it should unless it's missing low level drivers (which is plausible)
[20:21:29] <amacater> All that is the install process. If you know a bunch of (fairly obscure) stuff, already have a Debian system installed and want to create a new instance on, say, a virtual machine - debootstrap may be suitable
[20:21:44] <amacater> but it demands significant prior knowledge
[20:22:13] <incal> OsteHovel, I don't intend to dd the drive but an imagine which I imagine would be a minimal but working vanilla Debian. now it seems such images doesn't exist tho
[20:22:14] <OsteHovel> Blondie101010, you have to run grub before removing the first/original drive right?

[20:22:36] <Blondie101010> OsteHovel:  grub is dynamic, so you could even pass the parameters on the command line
[20:22:46] <Blondie101010> but that is assuming that the initramfs will do the job
[20:22:49] <PMT> incal: I mean, if you want to do something novel for the sake of it, go for it, we're just telling you it's not necessary and not particularly beneficial.
[20:22:53] <incal> here are the instructions, right? https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/apds03.en.html
[20:23:27] <amacater> incal - A debian isntall without a GUI would work - if yours is a modern machine, I suggest you look to amd64 - 64 bit install for Intel/AMD
[20:23:37] <tjcarter> my favorite paste site continues to be termbin.com
[20:24:00] <Blondie101010> de-facto:  what triggers it is the URLs
[20:24:01] <OsteHovel> incal, Due to the verity of configurations that is done during installation of Debian, is why there is no precompiled "images", else the installer/configurator part would have to be a part of image

[20:30:24] <incal> amacater, you don't have complete but do you have incomplete without the GUI you mean or what did you mean by that?
[20:30:56] <incal> tjcarter, OK, great, that's the method then, I should start reading this... heh, yeah I knew it was possible
[20:31:25] <Blondie101010> but that will be at least 10 times longer to do!
[20:31:35] <Blondie101010> probably 50-100
[20:31:39] <amacater> I mean - we don't have a "full disk, everything pre-installed" like you'd get from Raspbian, we do have an installer to allow you to install what you want. One of the isntaller options is to install a minimum system - it's about 300 packages.
[20:31:56] <tjcarter> (I didn't trust Calamares because I couldn't see how to get it to preserve my LVM-on-LUKS setup, didn't feel like sitting here while 30TB copied from backup, etc., and I knew the old debian-installer didn't have the shell tools needed to activate LUKS containers without formatting them)
[20:32:20] <amacater> So the netinst installer is ~300M of download if you get the firmware one - and you boot from there.
[20:32:23] <de-facto> Blondie101010, ok so i have to replace any urls for paste.debian.net?
[20:32:31] <incal> amacater, heh, let's put it this way, do you have images _at all_ or is that method, dd and image, not even an option?
[20:32:33] <amacater> I don't recommend the debian-live image installer
[20:32:36] <tjcarter> incal: wait, you asked if I used debootstrap because you decided to do that and figured I wasn't that crazy, or because you've read me saying that I in fact AM that crazy?
[20:32:43] <de-facto> i mean that is the official Atom header there...
[20:33:16] <Blondie101010> de-facto:  don't know why you wanted to paste that, but I told you what part triggered the error from a 2 second test
[20:33:28] <incal> tjcarter, no, I don't think you are crazy, just wondering what method, if you did it with debootstrap then that's a method, maybe the image method isn't an option since no images available
[20:33:29] <Blondie101010> it's the URLs on top of your document
[20:34:14] <tjcarter> incal: it is almost a method.

[20:34:36] <amacater> https://www.debian.org/download is the link you want to get the Debian installer image or https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-cd/firmware-11.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso for the image including firmware which may make the install easier
[20:35:12] <tjcarter> incal: it leaves a lot of stuff in /etc undone, it leaves the debconf database basically unpopulated, it doesn't create /etc/fstab or /etc/crypttab, and it doesn't even try to install a bootloader.
[20:35:29] <amacater> The netinst is a bootable hybrid CD image - use dd to copy it to a USB and it will "just boot"
[20:35:34] <de-facto> ok thanks
[20:36:01] <tjcarter> If you're comfortable effectively installing like it's 1993, it's doable and you can know exactly what's done, how, and know that no legacy crap is left behind by so doing.
[20:36:27] <incal> amacater, yeah but now you talk installer again, that can't install on the same medium, right? so no point dd to the SSD? or am I wrong?

[20:39:08] <tjcarter> You can make your own installer image, and that's even supported.

[20:42:01] <Blondie101010> that's very well said

[20:53:05] <Blondie101010> the most challenging boot problem I've faced was having to fix a machine with no external drive after the device names got changed from hda to sda during a kernel upgrade...  with a USB key that would have been a simple fix
[20:54:36] <tjcarter> Blondie101010: if performing an upgrade from libc5 within 24 hours of installing Linux for the first time, screwing it up, getting help the 2nd time and doing ti right counts as "years of experience", then yes. I didn't have the benefit of apt either because Culus hadn't even started writing it yet I think.

[22:10:27] <tjcarter> Like I said, I support this
[22:11:35] <Blondie101010> experimenting to learn is fine
[22:11:48] <Blondie101010> but that implies finding solutions on your own
[22:12:06] <Blondie101010> otherwise you're delegating your learning task to someone else and won't learn much yourself
