[05:58:04] <ii14[m]> but yes, it should be gpu accelerated

[06:52:37] <mjlbach[m]> reading through the nvim-qt source (I don't use it)
[06:53:27] <mjlbach[m]> Yep, should work
[06:53:28] <mjlbach[m]> https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt/blob/4891c0c58e65de77771644e54942503a744e3a15/src/gui/runtime/doc/nvim_gui_shim.txt#L85-L88
[06:53:43] <mjlbach[m]> It's not a command though
[06:53:45] <mjlbach[m]> it's a variable
[06:58:12] <R2COM> so i set it like: vim.o.GuiWindowOpacity = 0.7 ?
[07:03:04] <R2COM> also, is it ok if i save my init.lua and temporarily put yours and see how it works for me? or it might cause problem if i later wanna put back my current init.lua
[07:03:04] <R2COM> ?
[07:03:38] <mjlbach[m]> Well you have yours working now no
[07:03:40] <mjlbach[m]> ?
[07:04:00] <mjlbach[m]> but yes if you just move yours out of the way and put mine in then everything should be fine
[07:04:28] <R2COM> and how do you set GuiWindowOpacity variable?
[07:04:45] <mjlbach[m]> its actually a command, I was right the first time
[07:04:56] <mjlbach[m]> I'm not sure why you don't have it if you are using nvim-qt

[07:26:46] <R2COM> we are all improving here
[07:28:18] <Bowuigi[m]> <R2COM> "so on win10 its better to run..." <- What are you running it on?
[07:28:28] <R2COM> just starting up nvim-qt
[07:28:37] <R2COM> nvim-qt.exe
[07:28:38] <Bowuigi[m]> Ah
[07:28:49] <R2COM> perhaps i should launch alacritty and just run nvim.exe
[07:28:59] <R2COM> i still cant make transdparent though
[07:29:00] <Bowuigi[m]> Does QT support transparency? That is cool
[07:29:00] <R2COM> hmm
[07:29:05] <R2COM> no
[07:29:06] <R2COM> i cant
[07:29:17] <R2COM> maybe i should actually start alacritty transparent and then start nvmi
[07:29:19] <R2COM> vi 
[07:29:21] <R2COM> nvim
[07:29:38] <Bowuigi[m]> To make neovim transparent on alacritty you have to make alacritty transparent
[07:30:01] <Bowuigi[m]> Wezterm is a good choice too
[07:30:07] <R2COM> by the way, side question; has anyone her tried running neovim from VsCode as plugin? is it even worth it? i heard that neovim from vscode as plugin actually runs real neovim, not some keymap replacement
[07:30:22] <R2COM> i heard that alacritty is like, fastest
[07:31:37] <trace987> I can not achieve getting an error in neovim away
[07:33:16] <Bowuigi[m]> R2COM: As far as my experience goes, Wezterm is faster than Kitty and Alacritty
[07:33:27] <Bowuigi[m]> Also it is configured in Lua
[07:33:39] <Bowuigi[m]> trace987: Which one?
[07:33:39] <R2COM> you did like time tree on same directory in all 3 and saw results?
[07:34:14] <Bowuigi[m]> R2COM: Time is fairly inconsistent, but yes
[07:34:20] <Bowuigi[m]> Also it starts faster
[07:35:00] <R2COM> so i installed it
[07:35:10] <R2COM> its fast and with GPU enabled when installed on win10 rite?
[07:36:54] <R2COM> it looks cool :)
[07:37:00] <trace987> https://pastebin.com/fPJCnskX
[07:37:05] <ii14[m]> it's just a bunch of characters in a grid, why does it matter if its gpu or not
[07:37:06] <trace987> Bowuigi[m], 
[07:37:11] <R2COM> by any chance you can give me quick hint how to make background vizible in Wezterm?
[07:37:30] <R2COM> i want characters to be displayed blazingly fast
[07:38:05] <Bowuigi[m]> R2COM: No idea, I use Linux
[07:38:30] <Bowuigi[m]> R2COM: There is an online documentation, but lemme get my config
[07:39:31] <Bowuigi[m]> https://github.com/Bowuigi/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua
[07:40:12] <Bowuigi[m]> The font name may be different from what is there since I installed it from the official nerd fonts page
[07:41:51] <Bowuigi[m]> The relevant part of the config is
[07:41:51] <Bowuigi[m]> ```lua
[07:41:51] <Bowuigi[m]> return { window_background_opacity = 0.7 }
[07:41:51] <Bowuigi[m]> ```
[07:41:56] <R2COM> no idea where i must drop wezterm.lua in win10
[07:42:06] <R2COM> i tried in Local and local/.config doesnt work
[07:42:30] <Bowuigi[m]> On XDG_CONFIG_HOME
[07:44:33] <saltrocklamp[m]> maybe somewhere in %LocalAppData%?
[07:46:10] <R2COM> i dropped wezterm.lua in same folder
[07:46:22] <R2COM> but for some reason when i open it, it opens regular window plus another with proper transparency
[07:46:23] <R2COM> anyway
[07:46:28] <R2COM> thats another topic ill sort it
[07:46:55] <R2COM> ah
[07:46:57] <R2COM> it couldnt find font
[07:48:24] <R2COM> solved
[07:49:14] <R2COM> ok but here is a thing, even though Wezterm starts transparent with background vizible, the moment i launch nvim from there, nvim is NOT transparent
[07:54:14] <saltrocklamp[m]> did you set a colorscheme in your init.vim?
[07:59:15] <R2COM> yes
[07:59:22] <R2COM> init.lua
[08:04:05] <R2COM> its strange cuz i dont run nvim-qt.exe
[08:04:22] <R2COM> i just run nvim.exe from terminal which was already transparent, but nvim starts up inside of it as non-transparent
[08:12:20] <Bowuigi[m]> <R2COM> "ok but here is a thing, even..." <- `set notermguicolors`
[08:14:07] <R2COM> = expected near notermguicolors
[08:14:10] <R2COM> uh 
[08:14:14] <R2COM> cuz its lua or 
[08:14:35] <R2COM> ok works
[08:14:44] <R2COM>   vim.cmd[[colorscheme tokyonight]]
[08:14:44] <R2COM>   vim.cmd[[set notermguicolors]]
[08:14:50] <R2COM> thats what i had to do
[08:16:17] <R2COM> it screwed color and popups for autocomplete pink
[08:16:18] <R2COM> lol
[08:17:42] <luisiacc[m]> you have to set `	text_background_opacity = 0.85,`  on wezterm config
[08:17:43] <luisiacc[m]> or make your background transparent on neovim
[08:17:44] <luisiacc[m]> s///
[08:17:44] <luisiacc[m]> right, the text_background_stuff if when you set a background image
[08:20:06] <trace987> It feels so good that my neovim is working again
[08:20:15] <R2COM> text_background_opacity = 0.85
[08:20:17] <R2COM> ^
[08:20:19] <R2COM> now that worked!
[08:24:57] <R2COM> ok... all is good but the lsp installer i got in, does not have verilog language support
[08:25:00] <R2COM> thats a bummer
[08:25:09] <R2COM> got c++, python, and lua, but no verilog
[08:26:55] <Bowuigi[m]> What is verilog?
[08:27:01] <R2COM> in freebsd i recall i got it as separate install
[08:27:05] <R2COM> it was called "svls"
[08:27:07] <R2COM> systemverilog
[08:27:14] <R2COM> and it covered verilog fine 
[08:27:29] <R2COM> but dont see "svls" in this lsp installer package
[08:34:00] <Bowuigi[m]> <Bowuigi[m]> "What is verilog?" <- I just looked at a paper from MIT describing it and oh wow

[08:40:50] <R2COM> i dont have slvs when i do: :LspInstallInfo
[08:41:17] <luisiacc[m]> apparently is not included on the nvim-lsp-installer 
[08:41:24] <luisiacc[m]> you have to do it manually
[08:41:43] <luisiacc[m]> from what I see it's pretty straightworfard
[08:41:59] <luisiacc[m]> s/straightworfard/straightforward/
[08:42:24] <R2COM> i did download slvs.exe and added to Path
[08:42:32] <R2COM> now :checkhealth shows that its "checked"
[08:42:34] <R2COM> doesnt show error
[08:42:41] <R2COM> however... i kinda not seeing autocomplete for it
[08:42:47] <R2COM> althoguh it picks keywords..
[08:42:53] <R2COM> although*
[08:45:30] <R2COM> well its ok ill see, perhaps it has limited functionality or something
[08:45:53] <R2COM> i see its not complaining on wrong syntax problems as clangd does for example
[08:52:24] <R2COM> it seems this thing requires vim-lsp
[08:52:29] <R2COM> or language client neovim
[08:54:44] <mjlbach[m]> I'm almost certain it works
[09:06:29] <trace987> does anyone wants to discuss my neovim config and has propasals for improvement? I am using neovim as a python IDE
[09:08:30] <R2COM> it kinda works
[09:08:41] <R2COM> but i feel that its not as superb as lsp for c++ like clangd
[09:09:11] <luisiacc[m]> clangd is beatiful
[09:11:07] <R2COM> by the way, i have vscode and there i confirmed that if i download vim plugin its kinda laggy working inside vscode
[09:11:23] <R2COM> for example if you shift right 10 times you can even see its animated
[09:11:39] <R2COM> but then i downloaded neovim plugin and it required real neovim installed in system, and that works without any lag
[09:11:48] <R2COM> perhaps because on backend it runs native neovim
[09:14:45] <R2COM> btw, any idea what would that sometimes mean for lspconfig as error "lspconfig matching root directory not detected" ?
[09:14:51] <R2COM> what matching root directory?
[09:21:29] <R2COM> hmm nvm
[09:21:29] <mjlbach[m]> you should read the documentation
[09:21:47] <R2COM> so yeah, i got it working kinda for now
[09:22:03] <R2COM> but still lots of weird little moments here and there have to be polished
[09:22:14] <R2COM> man it takes forever actually to bring all this tool to perfection
[09:22:29] <R2COM> like... tab in lsp for example, works beautifully for autocomplete
[09:22:42] <R2COM> but in insert mode when i need real *tab* it tries to call that same function
[09:22:44] <R2COM> etc etc

[10:15:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> and the mitm being in nvim itself?

[13:37:12] <M3N4N[m]> my tabline function in init.lua doesn't get reevaluated every time I open/close a tab.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/a5521235a1ab8241eea1e881adc22db7ac138267)
[13:37:41] <M3N4N[m]> the first one in init.vim works fine. the second line is in init.lua and it doesn't work.
[13:38:01] <p00f> i think vim.opt should be vimscript stuff?
[13:38:36] <p00f> because even in vimscript you're actually setting it to a string
[13:39:15] <p00f> and when https://github.com/alvarosevilla95/luatab.nvim didn't have a setup function i used to assign it to a string
[13:39:41] <p00f> so `vim.opt.tabline = "%!MyTabLine()`
[13:39:46] <p00f> * = "%!MyTabLine()"`
[13:40:41] <p00f> in fact this is what the setup function does here
[13:40:51] <p00f>  I zeus: luatab.nvim (master =) >  rg vim.opt.tabline
[13:40:51] <p00f> lua/luatab/init.lua
[13:40:51] <p00f> 113:    vim.opt.tabline = '%!v:lua.require\'luatab\'.helpers.tabline()'
[13:41:46] <p00f> p00f: so if MyTabline is a lua function you need to do the v:lua thing and wrap it in a string
[13:43:37] <p00f> (idk why they escaped the inner single quotes, could have just used double quotes for the outer ones)

[14:06:27] <riksteri> I am trying to debug a multiline errorformat, where errorformat that works in isolation changes behaviour if preceded by another errorformat entry
[14:06:43] <riksteri> when the earlier entry on its own does _not_ match the error message (and it should not match it, it's in the errorformat for a different situation)
[14:07:01] <riksteri> I wrote up the errorformats and the message I'm trying to capture here: https://paste.sr.ht/~riksteri/6918a4a0cb350db67e531c971b2de7c865584b38

[14:07:27] <riksteri> Why would the earlier, apparently non-matching, errorformat entry affect what gets matched?
[14:09:01] <pun> asking because it doesn't seem to work. 
[14:12:29] <p00f> <pun> "vimscript:  vim.cmd([[let..." <- " " instead of "<space>"

[14:14:00] <pun> p00f: actually vim.cmd works, I'm trying to migrate to vim.g.mapleader, but I haven't tried vim.g.mapleader = " ", will now

[18:17:01] <gpanders> > <@kylo252:matrix.org> I tried looking up what this command is supposed to do, but it's not really clear to me... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/0c54124e4c04f19eb1ddcd95393050b70e2b581a)
[18:17:28] <clason[m]> that's just standard Vim practice: avoid adding autocommands multiple times in case a script is re-sourced
[18:17:29] <gpanders> and it's considered rude to delete other people's autocommands :)
[18:17:32] <kylo252[m]> which one is `it` in this case? 
[18:17:42] <gpanders> `autocmd! * <buffer>`
[18:18:10] <gpanders> alternative 1 is to use `:autocmd! my_group * <buffer>` to only delete autocommands in `my_group`
[18:18:17] <gpanders> but if `my_group` doesn't already exist, that throws an error
[18:18:31] <gpanders> so alternative 2 which is safer is to use `augroup my_group | autocmd! * <buffer> | augroup END`
[18:18:36] <kylo252[m]> I don't want to delete anything if I don't have to, that's my point
[18:18:56] <clason[m]> you don't; that's what the augroup is for
[18:19:15] <clason[m]> I'd suggest looking at the whole augroup block as a fixed design pattern
[18:19:47] <kylo252[m]> I thought `augroup` is just a label?
[18:19:55] <clason[m]> yes
[18:20:19] <clason[m]> the point is to remove all autocommands with that label before you add them
[18:20:24] <clason[m]> so you don't add them twice
[18:20:34] <clason[m]> (in which case they would run twice on every event)
[18:21:06] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: okay, so the first step is to always call some kind of `:autocmd!` at the very top, correct?
[18:21:23] <clason[m]> yes
[18:21:30] <clason[m]> have you never noticed that pattern before?
[18:22:07] <kylo252[m]> what determines if it needs more arguments then? 
[18:22:16] <clason[m]> wdym?
[18:22:27] <kylo252[m]> or is the buffer boilerplate always `autocmd! * <buffer>`? 
[18:22:54] <gpanders> `autocmd!` alone removes all autocmds in the entire group
[18:23:05] <gpanders> `autocmd! * <buffer>` removes autocmds in the current buffer in the current group

[18:23:27] <gpanders> have you read through `:h autocommand` btw? all of this is documented
[18:23:31] <clason[m]> note that that snippet is supposed to go into the `on_attach` method
[18:23:38] <clason[m]> so it's run in a buffer context
[18:23:48] <clason[m]> (with the same name)
[18:24:33] <clason[m]> so without the `<buffer>`, it'd clear the commands from _all_ buffers, but define the new ones only for the current buffer
[18:24:40] <kylo252[m]> gpanders: maybe I've missed the part of why this is there, because I tried searching for any specific mention of `autocmd! *`  and nothing came up
[18:24:50] <clason[m]> I'll leave it as an exercise to come up with a situation where that would not be desirable
[18:25:08] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: I was gonna say that it sounds like a data-race guard 
[18:25:19] <clason[m]> don't just throw out words...

[18:29:56] <kylo252[m]> if I have a single autocmd, is it faster to check if it exists, or would it be better to wrap it in an augroup and check for that instead? maybe there's undesirable overhead for single commands?
[18:33:11] *** Joins: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo)
[18:33:27] <kylo252[m]> example:  a slow function `tsserver.setup()` that would eventually add an autocmd with a callback, but we don't know if the `setup()` has already started or not. For now I had to check the existence of  autocmd manually, but I'm wondering what are the pros/cons if that `setup_buffer()` autocmd was wrapped in an `augroup` isntead
[18:33:52] <clason[m]> read the docs
[18:35:10] <kylo252[m]> I mean it says "useful", but my question was specifically about overhead when it comes to wrapping a single command. if it's a waste or not for example
[18:35:43] <clason[m]> if you're really worried about that, profile
[18:36:02] <kylo252[m]> more of a design pattern thing
