[07:23:39] <JesseDesu> oh thats cool
[07:24:12] <JesseDesu> Urchin[emacs], an airbrush is basically spray paint but with precision tools

[09:22:30] <Satin> And yet at the same time, once I write it down, it's isolated in a pdf file till I export it to my Obsidian google drive/MEGA directory.
[09:22:46] <Satin> It's not useful, I don't edit it, I don't review it properly, it's not within arm's reach.
[09:23:15] <Satin> And yet at the same time, the way you can write in an android handwriting notes app, zoom in and out, use the pen, make drawings with different colors, use my actual handwriting...
[09:23:17] <Satin> FUCK'S SAKE.
[09:23:35] <Satin> I'm stuck in-between two different worlds and I don't know how to bring them together.
[09:23:49] <Satin> I wish there was a way for Obsidian to just magically accept handwriting input from my android tablet!
[09:24:05] <Satin> I view the same notes pdf files inside of obsidian, but scrolling with a pdf viewer for notes isn't the same at all.
[09:24:19] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: learn LaTeX

[17:25:38] <MootPoot> Idk, most people I know buy a stick or a Roku as well 
[17:25:49] <MootPoot> Since the onboard OS is usually shit 
[17:26:31] <JesseDesu> i need a device for my dumb 1080p ericson tv
[17:26:41] <JesseDesu> that mirrors my computer
[17:26:49] <JesseDesu> with hdmi
[17:26:51] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: go get a fire stick lite and use miracast or something 
[17:26:54] <JesseDesu> is there such a device
[17:26:59] <JesseDesu> ok ty

[17:27:22] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: why do you need a device... just use hdmi cable ?
[17:27:24] <JesseDesu> fuck dat dont want alexa
[17:27:26] <Terminus> i haven't seen a person use a roku or firestick in the philippines. chromecast is pretty common though that's google so support will happen there.
[17:27:32] <JesseDesu> Bco1981, wires
[17:27:35] <JesseDesu> i dont wanna trip
[17:27:43] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: well you dont have to use alexa
[17:27:45] <MootPoot> at all
[17:27:45] <JesseDesu> or staple gun a long ass hdmi
[17:27:53] <JesseDesu> ok cool
[17:27:55] <Terminus> but a chromecast doesn't help if you torrent an av1 and put it on a usb drive
[17:28:21] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: but you do need decent wifi throughput so
[17:28:25] <MootPoot> keep that in mind
[17:28:33] <MootPoot> although 1080p is probably fine
[17:29:12] <JesseDesu> i have a modern eero setup
[17:29:20] <JesseDesu> its less than 2 years old
[17:29:30] <MootPoot> those amazon eero things are kinda slow but it should be workable
[17:29:39] <JesseDesu> well
[17:29:42] <JesseDesu> i rent it
[17:29:52] <JesseDesu> $4/mo/per beacon
[17:30:15] <JesseDesu> i'm really paying for when it ever gets in trouble
[17:30:30] <JesseDesu> i can call support and they will actually do something
[17:30:44] <JesseDesu> where as buy your own router and ur on ur own
[17:30:53] <MootPoot> not really
[17:31:07] <JesseDesu> i was told this is so
[17:31:10] <MootPoot> if you buy your own router - depending on the manufacturer they can help you out
[17:31:22] <MootPoot> asus and TP link have really good customer support 
[17:31:29] <MootPoot> asus I've heard, TP link I use
[17:31:43] <Terminus> just know how to fix it yourself. 😂
[17:31:49] <MootPoot> TP link once made a custom edited router firmware for me  to fix a bug 
[17:31:52] <Bco1981> well god damn, had a mobo with a i5 4690k with 16gb ram laying hidden i had forgotten about.
[17:31:58] <JesseDesu> i think its part of the deal that even if you copy their model you need to rent theirs to get any support
[17:32:21] <JesseDesu> Bco1981, its the same feeling as finding $200 in your pants that you forgot to wash
[17:32:31] <MootPoot> Bco1981: nice
[17:32:42] <MootPoot> unfortunately I dont have that many systems
[17:33:07] <JesseDesu> mootpoot i have 7 airbrushes now
[17:33:13] <JesseDesu> shooting paint is addicting
[17:33:22] <MootPoot> why do you need  7
[17:33:37] <JesseDesu> small jobs, medium jobs, big jobs
[17:33:41] <MootPoot> ok
[17:33:43] <JesseDesu> beginner jobs,
[17:33:51] <JesseDesu> trigger options
[17:33:58] <JesseDesu> its like guns
[17:34:09] <MootPoot> I thought you could just get 1 good one
[17:34:12] <MootPoot> and stick a nozzle on it
[17:34:12] <JesseDesu> you understand guns right
[17:34:15] <JesseDesu> cant just have 1

[18:36:48] <MootPoot> I wish I had that much money to spend on a pc case
[18:36:49] <Sadale> dfch, I mean you bragged about this here years ago. Don't you want me to help you to spread the words?
[18:36:57] <MootPoot> I would not spend it on a PC case
[18:36:59] <MootPoot> but
[18:37:10] <MootPoot> dfch: what was so special about it
[18:37:16] <Sadale> MootPoot, I wonder!
[18:37:17] <MootPoot> completely passive?
[18:37:21] <Poeticode> waddup my duders it's friday
[18:38:20] <Sadale> Had a longer day than usual :(
[18:38:31] <Sadale> stupid work. It pays well enough tho.
[18:38:34] <MootPoot> my keyboard is in my country now
[18:38:45] <MootPoot> Sadale: can I ask about your job
[18:38:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, sure
[18:38:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, what kind of questions you'd like to ask?
[18:39:00] <MootPoot> how did you get into firmware developement
[18:39:10] <MootPoot> did you start with a normal CS degree?
[18:39:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope. I had a long history of being a hobbyist programmer. I do have an engineering degree tho. Transportation systems engineering.
[18:39:58] <MootPoot> then how'd you manage to get into programming from something mostly unrelated?
[18:39:59] <Sadale> My programming history actually started back in the middle school.
[18:40:18] <Poeticode> damnnn, engineering
[18:40:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, You really just need to convince the employer that you're good enough. That's it. And my final project does contain embedded shit as well.
[18:40:53] <MootPoot> so at work, you work with what kinda stuff?
[18:40:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, Anyway there're plenty of job opportunities here even for fresh graduates. It may be a bit more diffcult over there in Canada.
[18:41:06] <MootPoot> same thing as at home? STM32 etc 
[18:41:22] <MootPoot> or some kind of custom propritary thing
[18:41:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, Before graduation, I worked on a cargo scanning device. Basically it just use ESP8266 to scan a NFC tag and record that to a database, which's viewable with a web browser
[18:42:13] <Sadale> And I used Arduino library for that particular project.
[18:42:26] <MootPoot> I mean at your current work, today
[18:42:37] <MootPoot> is it the same stuff as you do at home?
[18:42:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. STM32 and ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.
[18:42:51] <MootPoot> huh
[18:43:02] <MootPoot> for some reason I thought you would be working with some super  high end stuff
[18:43:03] <Sadale> MootPoot, The nature ain't the same. But the stacks are similar.
[18:43:09] <MootPoot> 5000 dollar FPGA 
[18:43:22] <Sadale> lol nope. Maybe I'll learn FPGA some days later.'
[18:43:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, It's my first day job that I actually see people putting a raspberry pi into a product for sale.
[18:44:02] <MootPoot> so what kind of projects do you do at work?  Make embedded systems for other firms?
[18:44:05] <Sadale> It's kind of reasonable tho as the devices are sold for a good price.
[18:44:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope. in-house firmware development
[18:44:25] <MootPoot> Sadale: yeah that's a bit weird - like you'd probably just do dev on the pi and then move to smaller cheaper stuff 
[18:44:30] <MootPoot> on custom PCBs
[18:45:01] <Sadale> Yep. But the units sold isn't that high and they sell them for a good price. So it's worth just using the pi for saving development time. And development time is actually a cost.
[18:45:11] <Sadale> number of units sold*
[18:45:38] <MootPoot> so if you wanted to do embedded dev, why did you go to uni for transport engineering?
[18:46:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, Of course I don't just do firmware dev. It's a small company. So I also do other misc stuffs. Sometimes I help programming the devices. Sometimes I help assembling the devices. And sometimes I need to help resolving issue with the production in factory by talking to the people there.
[18:46:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, I didn't perform well in highschool. The score.
[18:46:44] <MootPoot> lol same
[18:46:59] <MootPoot> I'm not good at traditional studying
[18:47:14] <Sadale> Anyway I was happy to get an engineering degree offer. That's why I went for that.
[18:47:35] <MootPoot> I'm happy I went to my university
[18:47:38] <Sadale> damn. Stupid Chinese culture. I totally thought that a degree was everything :/
[18:47:44] <MootPoot> its not a big name university but 
[18:47:56] <Sadale> And you're almost graduating :3
[18:47:56] <MootPoot> saved me so much money
[18:48:03] <MootPoot> well its a applied university
[18:48:12] <Sadale> What does that mean?
[18:48:15] <MootPoot> kind of a hybrid between a trade school and a full university
[18:48:20] <Sadale> ah!
[18:48:44] <MootPoot> so most of what they do is trade stuff, but if you take the right paths you can get a full university degree and is recognized as such
[18:48:46] <MootPoot> like mine
[18:48:56] <Sadale> I see :3
[18:48:57] <MootPoot> so the prices are really low
[18:49:01] <Sadale> What kind of trade it is tho?
[18:49:03] <Sadale> programming?
[18:49:08] <Sadale> I mean the one that you've taken
[18:49:20] <MootPoot> well, for me I took programming/business+management
[18:49:25] <Sadale> ah
[18:49:35] <MootPoot> but mostly this place is based around the applied things
[18:49:41] <Sadale> I find it funny how people are teaching business management. As if it could be just taught!
[18:49:45] <MootPoot> forestry,  oil drilling work
[18:49:55] <MootPoot> Sadale: well its not business management per say
[18:50:07] <MootPoot> more like manager-level stuff
[18:50:19] <MootPoot> managerial accounting etc
[18:50:21] <Sadale> It requires so much soft skill and real work experience to actually do business management. IMHO whoever put that into a course are doing that just for the sake of sucking out student's tuition fee. :/
[18:50:40] <Sadale> ah. account.
[18:50:43] <Sadale> accounting.
[18:51:02] <MootPoot> and stuff like organizing a massive project with large employee numbers
[18:51:08] <MootPoot> not exactly like running a whole business
[18:51:14] <MootPoot> more like running a department
[18:51:19] <Sadale> easier said than done xD
[18:51:29] <MootPoot> I know, but the classes were good
[18:51:35] <MootPoot> anyway, for what I got, I paid basically nothing
[18:51:43] <Sadale> nice! :3
[18:51:57] <MootPoot> all 3 of my things here if I got them elsewhere I would have paid like 80k or something
[18:52:06] <MootPoot> but I paid only 22k
[18:52:08] <MootPoot> :3
[18:52:10] <Sadale> lucky you. My stupid parents paid for my tuition fee. I got a bit scholarship tho so I've got my tuition fee partially covered
[18:52:21] <Sadale> nice. 22k isn't too bad :3
[18:52:31] <MootPoot> my parents paid for most of that 22k as well
[18:52:44] <Sadale> actually that's about the same as the tuition fee for local students here. xD
[18:52:44] <MootPoot> I have to personally pay like 4-5 k myself
[18:53:10] <Sadale> education is a scam :/
[18:53:17] <MootPoot> eh, not really
[18:53:21] <Sadale> dfch, ^
[18:53:24] <MootPoot> the prices, yes
[18:53:29] <MootPoot> in some cases
[18:53:50] <dfch> Sadale amen
[18:53:50] <MootPoot> but I'm 100% sure if we didnt mandate it the way we did
[18:53:56] <MootPoot> almost nobody would actually know anything
[18:54:09] <MootPoot> beyond the basics to get along in society
[18:54:18] <Sadale> Dunno. I find it funny how the school taught me like nothing. I've barely learned any technical skills that's put into use there. Neither that I've learned any non-technical skills there. :/
[18:54:43] <Sadale> By the time I graduate I wasn't even able to get along with people. :/
[18:55:00] <Jigsy> People are overrated.
[18:55:02] <Sadale> Took me a few years to figure the shit out. Now that I'm kind of able to get along with people xD
[18:55:20] <Sadale> Jigsy++
[18:55:58] <Sadale> time to watch anime. ttyl :3

[22:17:41] <emmeka> I open reddit, and it brings up a page that just says "blocked" in plaintext
[22:17:51] <emmeka> same for my wife. ???
[22:18:22] <MootPoot> good, probably better for you
[22:18:31] <MootPoot> take it as a positive
[22:18:56] <emmeka> but it's bizarre. I'm assuming I'm not like, k-lined from reddit
[22:19:20] <HeTo> well, if you are, you're not alone, I get that too
[22:19:27] <MootPoot> try a simple ping and see what happens?
[22:21:42] <MootPoot> amazon sent me a pair of pliers but they are chipped
[22:21:49] <emmeka> but like what's it blocking. my IP? since it's both my wife and I affected

[22:22:02] <MootPoot> I told them about it and they're sending a new pair without returning the  old one
[22:22:14] <MootPoot> so now I have a pair of chipped pliers
[22:22:38] <MootPoot> emmeka: if its plaintext I would guess its your routing to reddit rather then reddit itself
[22:22:48] <MootPoot> can you do a simple ping to reddit?
[22:22:59] <MootPoot> then see if you can find  out your packet path to reddit
[22:23:14] <MootPoot> depending on the rsults you may want to call your ISP about routing issues
[22:24:07] <HeTo> MootPoot: what routing issues? it's clear the packets have no trouble finding their way
[22:24:40] <HeTo> I wonder if there's a way to force Firefox to use IPv4
[22:24:45] <emmeka> MootPoot 77 packets transmitted, 77 received, 0% packet loss, time 76016ms
[22:24:47] <emmeka> ???
[22:24:49] <MootPoot> well he said its blocked in plaintext
[22:24:58] <MootPoot> reddit's blocked page is a fancy one
[22:25:09] <dfch> Blocked here too

[22:25:21] <emmeka> is it just down or something
[22:25:33] <MootPoot> reddit works for me
[22:25:34] <HeTo> MootPoot: at least for me it's served with HTTPS, so it is coming from Reddit, or someone who has been able to get a certificate signed for reddit

[22:28:19] <Bco1981> maybe they have anti-ddos protection going, and have geo locked their site.
[22:28:33] <HeTo> ah, IPv4 works
[22:29:16] <HeTo> so some Reddit server admin just made an anti-ddos rule blocking all IPv6 traffic or something?
[22:29:21] <MootPoot> Bco1981: dosen't reddit use cloudflare?
