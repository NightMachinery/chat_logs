[14:35:24] <digitok> in which language
[14:37:32] <no_gravity> Regular Expressions
[14:37:39] <digitok> be more specific
[14:38:36] <no_gravity> Which part do you not understand?
[14:38:58] <digitok> regular expressions isn't a programming language
[14:39:02] <purplex> no_gravity: you have been doing regex for quite a while, i expected you to know the language
[14:39:30] <no_gravity> purplex: Not sure what you mean.
[14:39:46] <digitok> also, requesting specificity doesn't imply a lack of understanding
[14:39:52] <digitok> if anything, it's the opposite
[14:40:20] <nitro> ^ what lang or app; [[:space:]]+  would be a way for php or awk, but not python 
[14:40:29] <digitok> correct
[14:41:01] <digitok> although that won't match nbsp
[14:41:06] <digitok> but it demonstrates the point
[14:41:26] <purplex> no_gravity: do you understand the terms regex flavor and programming language?
[14:41:51] <digitok> i could've answered this 6 minutes ago already
[14:42:36] <no_gravity> digitok: '[[:space:]]' matches normal spaces. I am looking for a way to match unnormal spaces.
[14:42:45] <digitok> did i not just say that
[14:42:48] <digitok> answer my question
[14:43:01] <purplex> and mine too :p
[14:44:40] *** Quits: joo_ (~joo@fsf/member/joo--) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:45:27] <digitok> you're clearly having trouble answering questions, so the answer to your question is to copy all of the non-normal spaces and paste them inside []
[14:45:50] <digitok> that's the best i'm gonna offer given 0 information
[14:46:49] <no_gravity> This seems promising: [\x00-\x1F\x7F-\xFF]
[14:48:34] <no_gravity> Ah no, that also matches a bunch of other chars.
[14:49:00] <no_gravity> Do I really have to manually compile a list of "annoying whitespace and non printable chars"? Hmm...
[14:49:14] <digitok> nope
[14:51:09] <digitok> also, non-printable and whitespace aren't the same thing
[14:51:18] <digitok> non-printable wasn't part of your initial question
[14:51:46] <purplex> His space character seems to be a NO-BREAK SPACE U+00A0
[14:51:59] <digitok> yep
[14:52:07] <digitok> <digitok> although that won't match nbsp
[14:52:51] <no_gravity> I want to match any char that is not visible or is not the space that I get when I hit the space bar.
[14:53:24] <digitok> which language
[14:53:39] <no_gravity> If PHP would have something built in, I would use that.
[14:54:13] <digitok> i thought you were using Regular Expressions language
[14:54:49] <purplex> Okay perl 5.10 sucessfully matches it using \s
[14:55:47] <no_gravity> purplex: Matches what?
[14:56:13] <purplex> because it includes unicode space characters, but rest of them use ASCII (PCRE, Java) etc.
[14:57:30] <digitok> (?! )[\p{Zs}\x00-\x1F]
[14:58:00] <digitok> pcre uses unicode with /u enabled
[14:58:25] <digitok> but that regex doesn't require it
[14:59:22] <purplex> ah ok, my software didn't use it even with /u, its just regex101 pcre then
[14:59:32] <Me-me> Bah. SQLite Studio comes up with a "regexp" option but won't tell me what kind of regexp it uses.
[14:59:54] <no_gravity> digitok: That does not look bad: https://3v4l.org/Q2aKW
[14:59:56] <digitok> sql regex usually sucks
[15:00:16] <Me-me> Well the thing is I don't think the SQL is involved. It's importing data.
[15:00:34] <no_gravity> Yeah, no SQL involved.
[15:00:38] <digitok> right
[15:00:49] <Me-me> Sorry no_gravity I thought digitok was responding to me.
[15:00:54] <no_gravity> It is data from users. They come up with the craziest non printable chars one can imagine.

[15:01:43] <no_gravity> digitok: What does the "p{Zs}" do?
[15:04:02] <purplex> it does nothing unless you add \ in front
[15:04:34] <purplex> it matches your "unnormal" space
[15:05:14] <digitok> it matches unicode space separators, but \s is probably better tbh
[15:05:27] <digitok> /(?! )[\s\x00-\x1F]/u
[15:06:51] <no_gravity> digitok: Thinking about it, it is ok to match the normal space too. I will just replace any sequence of whatever whitespace with one normal whitespace.
[15:06:59] <purplex> i see why are \x00-\x1F there, digitok? if \s has /u?
[15:07:35] <digitok> that's ascii 0-31
[15:08:25] <digitok> a few spaces but mostly non-printable
[15:09:09] <digitok> \p{Zs} seems to match most of what \s matches except tabs
[15:09:16] <digitok> (with /u enabled for \s)
[15:09:25] <no_gravity> So maybe this is the solution? https://3v4l.org/bpZ2q
[15:09:29] <purplex> so for a future possibility of unnormal space between 0 and 31 control characters
[15:09:55] <digitok> 07no_gravity, you didn't want to include the control chars?
[15:10:45] <purplex> i believe he doesn't know, he found that solution by chance
[15:10:48] <digitok> if not then yes, that would be the solution
[15:10:55] <digitok> but you can remove the []
[15:11:00] <digitok> /\s+/u
[15:11:51] <purplex> did you copy [\x00-\x1F\x7F-\xFF] off somewhere, no_gravity?
[15:11:59] <no_gravity> purplex: Probably
[15:12:10] <no_gravity> digitok: Yeah, control chars should go away too.
[15:12:18] <digitok> -_-
[15:12:28] <digitok> then /[\s\x00-\x1F]+/u
[15:13:52] <purplex> 99% probability? :P
[15:14:28] <digitok> hehe
[15:14:33] <no_gravity> digitok: Those are all control chars?
[15:14:39] <digitok> no idea
[15:14:58] <no_gravity> digitok: I mean is it safe to assume that \x00-\x1f *only* contain control chars?
[15:15:18] <digitok> other than newlines yep
[15:15:27] <no_gravity> Nice. Lets kill those!
[15:15:41] <no_gravity> How can I test one of those? Can you paste such a char here?

[15:16:20] <digitok> whether you can copy it is another thing
[15:16:49] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/QpDewF/1
[15:17:40] <digitok> \p{Cc} might be better, that includes 65 chars
[15:17:51] <digitok> https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Cc/list.htm
[15:19:26] <digitok> equivalent to [\x00-\x1F\x80-\x9F]
[15:20:05] <purplex> yeah those are complete set of control characters
[15:20:05] <digitok> /[\s\p{Cc}]+/u
[15:20:13] <no_gravity> digitok: Hmm.. it seems to not match those: https://3v4l.org/IOoZ5
[15:20:15] <digitok> seems like the best
[15:20:42] <no_gravity> digitok: \p{...} is like "a category of strings"?

[15:36:50] <digitok> php uses str in a lot of functions
[15:37:07] <no_gravity> digitok: Yeah, but I think that is a sign of being an internal function.
[15:37:26] <no_gravity> Also using all lowercase chars I think is a sign up "this is an internal function".

[15:37:36] <digitok> fair enough
[15:38:17] <digitok> so yea the modifier i was looking for is xx

[15:43:44] <purplex> now to answer your question, you are using regex in php language with regex flavor "php preg" i believe? when next time it is asked
[15:43:51] *** Quits: MrNato_Home (MrNato_Hom@61.29.44.88) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:44:06] <digitok> it's pcre
[15:44:29] <digitok> iirc, preg means perl regular expressions
[15:44:49] <digitok> since it also has ereg for ERE
[15:45:20] <no_gravity> Ok, cool.
[15:45:41] <purplex> yea but i have seen "php preg 7.4" too
[15:45:56] <purplex> ERE and pcre being different
[15:46:05] *** Joins: MrNato_Home (MrNato_Hom@61.29.44.88)
[15:47:24] <digitok> 7.4 would be the php version
[15:47:33] <digitok> preg is the function prefix
[15:48:08] <purplex> says like "The preg functions support a modern full-featured regex syntax based on the PCRE library and are recommended for new code. Since PHP 7.3.0 they are based on PCRE2."
[15:48:16] <digitok> yep

[16:05:43] <digitok> your software probably mentions preg to distinguish it from ereg in case ppl know about that
[16:11:13] <digitok> the ereg_* posix functions are deprecated, but they have some for "multibyte strings", mb_ereg_*, which apparently use oniguruma regex
[16:14:31] <purplex> i won't know at all since i never used php, but regardless i can read a regex now more quickly than before. i recall a time when i struggled to know what things like [^a] does, time really passes quickly

[22:22:29] <re101-badger-59> https://regex101.com/settings
[22:22:35] <re101-badger-59> my question is about the settings
[22:22:57] <re101-badger-59> I see that there's a dropdown for the "code generator" and that sed is one of the options. But I don't see how to tell it whether I want to test things in BRE or ERE
[22:24:05] <re101-badger-59> The "flavors" all seem to be language names. Other than pcre, I don't know what kind of regexes those other languages use, so I don't know if any of them use BRE or ERE
[22:24:39] <re101-badger-59> pcre is presumably like what grep does with -P option, but what if I want to test for the -E option, or with neither?
[22:25:18] <re101-badger-59> but also since the pcre ones say php on them i don't know if there's php-specific things they'd be doing, or which one would be like grep -P
[22:25:38] <re101-badger-59> and sed doesn't even have a -P option, afaik
[22:35:13] <rewt> if you use the code generator, and select sed, it looks like it's generating it with -E, so that's ERE
[22:36:19] *** shantaram is now known as shan
[22:36:29] <rewt> there's no codegen for grep, but yes, by default it's BRE, with -E it's ERE, and with -P it's PCRE
[22:41:17] <rewt> there's pcre and prce2, which are slightly different; they have the PHP versions to indicate the versions of PHP that have those flavours, because PHP changed what it uses
[22:44:29] <re101-badger-59> if i'm trying to write a sed or grep regex, which "flavor" should i select in the main page?
[22:45:38] <re101-badger-59> i don't actually know most of the langues it lists, but i have the sneaking suspicion they're probably all approximations of perl-like
[22:45:47] <rewt> pcre is usually close enough to ERE until you start using more advanced features, so that's usually a safe bet for sed -E, and grep -P can go pcre directly so there shouldn't be any issues with that
[22:47:05] <re101-badger-59> which pcre does grep -P use? i guess it might depend on the version of grep...
[22:49:07] <rewt> probably pcre, since there's a pcre2grep
[22:50:47] <re101-badger-59> cool beans, thanks! (awesome tool, too, even if i'm a little slow picking up on what it's doing at first lol)
