[19:53:16] <Security> :)
[19:53:51] <bookworm> who's that provider if I may ask?
[19:54:25] <Security> can i pm it
[19:55:27] <bookworm> that secret?
[19:55:39] <bookworm> I mean you can but why make such a fuss out of it?
[19:55:55] <Security> one of them is in any network lol
[19:56:35] <Security> sisrv is anyway
[19:56:38] <Security> is not secret
[19:57:31] <Security> a friend of mine told me about them there was a guy very helpful but seems he is not anymore there  new admins but they seem not very helpful
[19:59:13] <bookworm> just ditch them, and use a simple run of the mill linux VPS provider
[20:00:26] <bookworm> then you *actually* have full admin permissions and can do whatever you like for less than what they charge you now
[20:01:16] <Security> ive heard ovh has good anti ddos protection vps to but never tried them
[20:01:30] <bookworm> they are actually not good no
[20:01:40] <bookworm> least not if you want ipv6 access in a proper way
[20:02:55] <bookworm> (they allocate you a /128 rather than an /64 like they're supposed to)
[20:03:03] <Security> if u know any good ones can i have the link i will check them out if im happy i may order it set it up an running then i will cancel  my shell
[20:03:24] <bookworm> depends on your location, I like Hetzner, even if they are a bit more expensive than the rest
[20:04:08] <bookworm> but they operate from Germany which I like more than some company in the US
[20:04:22] <bookworm> your mileage may very, naturally
[20:04:32] <bookworm> vary*
[20:04:55] <Security> im in uk so germany sounds good
[20:05:34] <Security> i googled Hetzner but dont know wich one is right website
[20:05:50] <bookworm> https://www.hetzner.com/
[20:05:51] <Security> is it with com
[20:05:53] <Security> ok got it
[20:05:55] <Security> thx
[20:07:35] <Security> whats the difference with dedicated and cloud
[20:07:51] <bookworm> cloud is a "vps", dedicated means "here's your hardware, have fun"
[20:08:07] <bookworm> a VPS is shared with other people on the same box
[20:08:36] <Security> cloud sounds better then innit
[20:08:41] <bookworm> you probably want one of the cheap-ish cloud instances like CX11 or CX21 ro some such to start
[20:08:56] <Security> checkin them out
[20:08:58] <bookworm> you can always upgrade to something else if you find the need to do so
[20:10:20] <Security> cpx21 sounds good
[20:12:09] <bookworm> have to run, but good luck and have fun :)
[20:14:42] <Security> thanks for ur help im goin to will check them later again cheers bye
