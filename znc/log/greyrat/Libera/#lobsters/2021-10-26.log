[06:13:12] <dimadima> like, in kubernetes, there's no `depends_on` equivalent at all
[06:13:18] <dimadima> you just have to make it work
[06:13:34] <dimadima> i kind of see where they're coming from, but it can be annoying if you have a small, simple system

[06:14:09] *** Quits: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:14:31] <dimadima> really knowing when your process is "ready" is, in my opinion, sometimes equally if not more difficult to set up than just having it not matter
[06:14:39] <dimadima> my shits just restart until everything works lol
[06:14:51] <MelMalik> sounds like runit
[06:15:11] <dimadima> whats runit
[06:15:18] <dimadima> i guess i can google that
[06:15:31] <dimadima> ah
[06:15:50] <dimadima> my impression is that's sort of a common tactic
[06:16:29] <MelMalik> runit is an older supervisory init service that doesn't have any dependency management worth speaking of
[06:17:40] <dimadima> systemd lets you specify dependencies but you have the same issue right? specifying some "ready heuristic"
[06:18:09] <dimadima> which, for an HTTP service, may involve coding something that responds to GET /ruok
[06:18:20] <dimadima> that shit kills me
[06:20:49] <defect> i think systemd has some kind of readiness system, but i haven't seen it used. and i don't think it can do things like hit /health over http
[06:21:16] <dimadima> i think it lets you call curl
[06:21:43] <dimadima> love how the runit logo is a freakin football player

[06:42:01] <dimadima> not to keep referring to kubernetes, but in k8s if your init containers fail, your pod doesn't start
[06:42:18] <dimadima> the thing about kubernetes is that it has everythin figured out
[06:42:24] <dimadima> i say that as a joke, and i say that seriously
[06:42:49] <dimadima> my experience reading those docs for the first few times was like "oh look a system that just about has everything figured out"
[06:43:28] <dimadima> less so with docker compose, though docker compose is also quite pleasant

[06:55:01] <technomancy> the only real complaint I have with kubernetes is its mind-blowingly stupid base64-encoded secrets
[06:55:21] <technomancy> (I'm sure I would have more complaints if we didn't have a full-time team of engineers managing the cluster so I don't have to care about it)
[06:55:26] <dimadima> technomancy: yeah i wonder what the deal was with that? just to visually obfuscate them??
[06:55:41] <dimadima> to discourage you from using opaque secrets?
[06:55:49] <dimadima> i also want to know about that design decisions
[06:55:50] <technomancy> dimadima: whatever the reason it cannot possibly be good enough
[06:55:57] <technomancy> my guess is they accidentally let an intern design it
[06:56:01] <technomancy> like java.util.Date
[06:56:01] <dimadima> it feels that way sometimes yes
[06:56:15] <dimadima> technomancy: is that really the story behind j.u.Date?
[06:56:29] <technomancy> just my hypothesis
[06:56:36] <dimadima> heh
[06:56:47] <dimadima> the bas64 encoding is _very_ suspcious
[06:57:12] <technomancy> it's even worse because echo | base64 gives a trailing newline on SOME shells and not on others
[06:57:30] <technomancy> so you can't even tell if you're entering the right data until it's already out to the pod and causing a crashloop

[06:57:44] <dimadima> technomancy: that's why i'm still and will always be using bash
[06:58:07] <technomancy> I don't even know which one bash does
[06:58:09] <dimadima> i've learned to love the crashloop
[06:58:20] <technomancy> the point is you shouldn't have to know; you should be able to see when you make a typo
[06:58:24] <dimadima> you need -n to skip the newline
[06:58:29] <dimadima> yeah it's inane
[06:58:47] <dimadima> base64 isn't going to fool anyone who's looking
[06:58:59] <dimadima> i've never been able to imagine the reason
[06:59:06] <dimadima> i tell myself some day i'll find out
[06:59:15] <technomancy> all the reasons I can imagine have been honestly worse than not knowing
[06:59:33] <technomancy> ("what if you need to put binary data in your secrets???")

[14:22:05] <ignaloidas> at most it can refuse to give you the encryption keys to your hard drive if something weird was booted, but not more

[14:23:32] <rhn_mk1> AFAIK, TPM was the root of trust for the "secure boot" functionality that will refuse booting your OS unless it's signed by Microsoft's keys

[14:24:16] <ignaloidas> in bios flash
[14:25:06] <ignaloidas> the measurement of the root of trust is recorded in the TPM though, and it can refuse giving keys if it's different

[14:31:13] <kline> dsc_, if/when you submit it, let me know as im interested in following that

[14:31:20] <dsc_> kline: sure
[14:31:24] <rhn_mk1> and the quote becomes right
[14:32:37] <ignaloidas> basically, what you can do is provide measurements to the TPM of what code you run, get a quote of the measurements signed by it, and protect keys to be only available under said measurements
[14:33:09] <riv> ah UEFI is basically EFI 2.0

[14:34:38] <kline> stdout
[14:35:01] <dsc_> well it is doing usage(0)
[14:35:07] <kline> --help calls usage() with err being false and should then use stdout as a target
[14:35:11] <dsc_> which ends up evaluating to stderr in that ternary

[16:44:36] <c355E3B> riv: Did you ever get to use Flex back when it was around? It basically was what you were describing.
[16:44:50] <c355E3B> I really liked it, but like most of the Flash ecosystem, you had to deal with Flash Player
[16:46:23] <rb> southclaws: zig is actually getting pretty close to that. build.zig means you usually need to just do `git clone --recurse-submodules the-project && cd the-project && zig build` and that's it
[16:46:50] <rb> there's some sort of package manager called "gyro" but i have avoided using that so far, i'm going the submodule route for the time being
[16:47:02] <southclaws> that's good, though submodules have the UX of a wet brick
[16:47:11] <rb> mm squishy
[16:47:15] <riv> are submodules really so bad?
[16:47:18] <southclaws> yeah
[16:47:23] <southclaws> tried removing one
[16:47:23] <rb> i haven't had a problem with them
[16:47:40] <southclaws> it's like 2 commands and diving into .git to remove some random files
[16:48:00] <rb> hmm... i'd think it's just modifying .gitmodules and then rm -rf
[16:48:02] <southclaws> they should clone automatically too but you gotta run 2 commands to actually get the stuff you need
[16:48:06] <rb> guess i haven't tried that
[16:48:19] <rb> southclaws: --recurse-submodules automatically fetches them recursively
[16:48:22] <southclaws> lots of leaky abstraction tbh, weird how they never improved it
[16:48:23] <rb> that's why i included it in the line
[16:48:32] <southclaws> yeah exactly, you have to explicitly ask for it but it feels like it should be a sane default
[16:48:35] <rb> you use it like "git clone --recurse-submodules thing-url"
[16:48:39] <rb> oh i agree
[16:48:40] <southclaws> I know
[16:48:50] <southclaws> sane defaults seems to be against the git design philosophy though xD
[16:48:53] <rb> maybe they'll introduce some git config setting
[16:49:02] <rb> they fixed pull via pull.rebase at least
[16:49:07] <southclaws> honestly surprised there are no alternative git tools that are popular
[16:49:11] <rb> hoping the same thing happens with submodules
[16:49:23] <riv> flex gui looks nice! i never used that
[16:49:26] <southclaws> feels like git is more like a low level tool that could be built on
[16:49:30] <rb> (incoming vc holy wars...)
[16:49:38] <riv> the thing i really like about HTML is the ability to address and refer to any UI element

[17:50:39] <dsc_> love creative stuff like this :)
[17:51:17] <shapr> one that's been buzzing around my head is a swype keyboard that explicitly de-collides the most common words.
[17:51:45] <shapr> For example, I write the words 'code' and 'coffee' on my phone often, but they have the same swype pattern, so my phone just can't tell
[17:53:10] <shapr> another take on markov keyboard would be to 'chord' keys and use a user specific markov chain to guess which word is requested based on the previous words typed.
[17:53:16] <ngoldbaum> need to get better at finding d and f on your keyboard :p
[17:53:55] <shapr> ngoldbaum: yeah, but why the heck is my phone keyboard qwerty?

[20:42:55] <creature> I'm in favour of as little JS as possible, but there's a bunch of use cases where that doesn't cut it. And, well, it's never been easier to do static files if you want to.
[20:43:18] <creature> Though I do wish more people started with "What's the simplest tech stack I can use for X?" rather than "React is super-popular, so I will build X in React".
[20:44:02] <creature> I've been playing around with a Hugo site recently, and really quite like it. It's really boring tech! It's going to look terrible on my CV! It will cost me nothing to host, and I will never worry about database connections, and I will never get a Dependabot alert.
[20:48:06] <technomancy> you still need a 500MB haskell stack for that tho right?

[20:50:29] <creature> Hugo's a static site generator, so... not really. It's built in Go but as an end user I don't have to care about that. The way it does date formatting is pretty neat, though.
[20:50:52] <dimadima> next.js is also a static site generator

[22:15:41] <kline> G/A/M obviously being google, amazon, and microsoft and their cloud services
[22:16:20] <kline> so he's not a total google trubeliever or he's sandbagging them here because he thinks theyre going to win anyway and he'd rather conserve reputation
[22:17:44] <gerikson> I mean that novel is from 11 years ago...
