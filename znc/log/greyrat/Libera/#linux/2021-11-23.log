[08:15:41] <scottg489> Is there a way to change brightness (real or pseudo) based on how much light is coming out of the monitor without a light sensor? I'm on my desktop and every time I go to a screen where everything is white my eyes get blown out
[08:16:13] <TJ-> scottg489: might be easier to adopt a dark theme, if possible

[08:17:09] <TJ-> scottg489: there are various programs that'll adjust brightness based on time of day, with the assumption that during darkness you'd prefer less transmissive light
[08:17:34] <scottg489> TJ-: I do have it most places, using dark reader in Chrome and it does a pretty good job of not screwing up most websites
[08:17:47] <TJ-> same here, in browser
[08:18:02] <scottg489> TJ-: Yeah I'm using something called redshift which has helped a lot but doesn't really solve the problem of just more light coming out on white screens

[13:29:35] <lopid> apparently yt-dlp fixed it. i also thought the problem was at the remote side
[13:30:11] <PaulFertser> I mean normally mpv is using youtube-dl to get a URL and plays it back. But google started to throttle all standard https connections so mpv can't download fast enough to play it in realtime. How is youtube-dlp solving that?

[13:32:22] <PaulFertser> punchbag: yes, youtube-dlp manages fast downloads by mimicing web browser behaviour, that I understand. But how can it help with viewing with mpv without downloading?
[13:32:29] <lopid> it might help to use something like "--format 'best[height <=? 1200]'" at least with mpv, so you're not downloading a video too large for your screen

[17:07:41] <folaht> Yes, the user is going to have manually use port forwarding.
[17:07:54] <Blondie101010> but the public IP could change while the forwarding rule is in place
[17:07:58] <Blondie101010> use dyndns
[17:08:04] <koollman> that does give me one possibly decent idea : upnp :)

[17:08:11] <koollman> (for some definition of 'decent' of course)
[17:08:21] <koollman> at least it won't require an external service
[17:08:22] <folaht> Oh, well, I just thought I would do as little manually as I can.
[17:09:02] <BCMM> oh hang on, does upnp include a way to get the external address?
[17:09:05] <folaht> I don't think the server app would work if the IP changes.
[17:09:10] <Blondie101010> folaht:  you'll want dyndns on that platform anyways as soon as your IP changes
[17:09:12] <BCMM> i mean port forwarding is a lot less useful without that...
[17:09:38] <koollman> BCMM: yep
[17:09:42] <Blondie101010> if the IP never changes, then there is no point in getting it automatically

[17:11:24] <rcf> folaht: dynamic dns usually works with an update script you run as a cronjob or a timer unit.
[17:11:27] <Blondie101010> if you mean that server A talks to server B and server B needs to know who server A is, it just needs to look at the IP it got!!!

[19:51:00] <esselfe> wget -c is quite handy

[19:51:28] <phogg> frojnd: there could be many, many reasons why an error might occur when making an HTTP connection. You should handle as many of them as you can.

In logging in, the default user is "vagrant" with pw "vagrant".     Yet, when I go to install guest additions CD, I get asked for "administrator" password as seen here: https://ibb.co/S5rKF33  ....yet I don't recall setting up an admin password.  Anyone know if there's a default admin password?

[23:41:08] <gry_> no microphone is listed in pavucontrol, though it worked a month ago. this is debian. purging and reinstalling pulseaudio, alsa-utils and alsamixergui didn't help. what's possible next?

[23:43:52] <frojnd> gry_: fried sound card?
[23:44:27] <hexnewbie> gry_: I'd first see where the culprit lies. See if the problem is at the level of ALSA by seeing if there capture device for your card in /proc/asound/devices (pr /dev/snd/pcm*c chardev), if it shows in ‘alsamixer -c X’ where X is the card number. Then, if it exists, check PA with ‘pactl list sinks’, etc.
[23:45:02] <hexnewbie> Er, pactl list sources
