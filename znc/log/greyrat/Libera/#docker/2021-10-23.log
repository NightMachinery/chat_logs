[01:13:32] <AnselmoCampanas> I would like to know how can I monitor de memcache instance to see if there is any connection
[01:13:41] <Guest-69> hello, what is the intended way to connect from isolated docker network to a different subnet available on host?
[01:15:19] <Guest-69> i would like docker container in docker network 'test' be able to connect to 10.0.60.1 which is a tap device for vpn and route the traffic. ip routes are set on the host.

[01:19:20] <tabakhase> AnselmoCampanas and what you mean by monitor if there is a connection? - talk to its API? - or like, tcpdump? -> you can "rtun another container in the network space of it" see https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot and one of the many sample commands there (note the "--net container:NAME")
[01:20:48] <tabakhase> Guest-69 tried doing it? - to some extend that all "should just work" - your host acts like a router doing s&d-NAT for containers

[03:52:46] <lenswipe> hey folks
[03:53:13] <lenswipe> Got a question about docker swarm. I'm running a swarm service that needs to see mDNS traffic. Is there a way to get mDNS traffic into an arbitary network in docker swarm?
[03:57:08] <zoredache> I would at some of the mdns-repeater hits on Google
[03:57:20] *** Joins: dmalteseknight (~dmaltesek@user/dmalteseknight)
[03:57:39] <lenswipe> zoredache, i have an mdns repeater image. The problem is that in order for it to do its thing, it needs to run in host mode.
[03:57:45] <lenswipe> ....swarm services cannot run in host mode.
[03:57:54] <lenswipe> that's the rub.
[03:58:57] <zoredache> I thought they could I am almost certain I had my traefik service connected to the host network.
[03:59:28] <zoredache> or I could be miss-understanding what the host option does in the ports.
[03:59:42] <lenswipe> Why would you have traefik on the host network?
[03:59:51] <lenswipe> mine is just on ingress iirc
[04:00:16] <zoredache> Because I wanted IPv6 to work, and until recently getting docker to work with IPv6 wasn't possible.
[04:00:39] <lenswipe> oh, right!
[04:01:02] <zoredache> You might need to run the mdns-repeater as a container.
[04:01:08] <lenswipe> i can set network_mode: host in my stack definition file but it doesn't do anything
[04:01:08] <zoredache> and not a service
[04:01:12] <lenswipe> what do you mean
[04:01:23] <lenswipe> oh you mean from a compose file, rather than a swarm service?
[04:01:52] <zoredache> Sure, if you are using compose.
[04:02:09] <zoredache> I was more talking about just `docker container ...` .
[04:02:11] *** Joins: jazzy2 (~jaziz@user/jaziz)
[04:02:35] <lenswipe> Right
[04:02:51] <zoredache> Though you might not be able to have host and another network there either...  Hrm.
[04:02:51] <lenswipe> in this case, I was more hoping for something that was managed by the docker engine though rather than random init scripts
[04:03:17] *** Quits: jazzy2 (~jaziz@user/jaziz) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[04:03:22] <lenswipe> ultimately this boils down to the fact that I'm running home assistant in docker swarm, which is lovely except that some of the integrations don't allow you to just point it an IP address
[04:03:26] *** Joins: snedd (~snedd@86.14.114.137)
[04:03:40] <lenswipe> so, I can't just say "Hey, the thermostat is at this IP and always will be". No, it has to "discover" it on the network.
[04:04:03] <lenswipe> This has the effect of being incredibly annoying to deal with and it makes the lights on my switch look like something from ministry of sound

[04:08:30] <zoredache> Anyway there might not be a good answer. mdns is a locally scoped broadcast.
[04:09:57] <lenswipe> Yeah, i know :(
[04:10:24] <lenswipe> The actual devices exist on another VLAN entirely, but I managed to get a repeater built into my router to re-broadcast on to my local network.

[04:10:54] <lenswipe> that works great....if I can just get those same broadcast re-broadcast one last time into docker...i can get home assistant working properly.

[17:58:58] <eagles0513875> akik the issue seems to be regardless of the container i use
[17:59:28] <eagles0513875> im not sure if this is an issue with my windows setup or a bug in docker for windows
[18:06:59] <akik> eagles0513875: is it docker desktop you're using? i don't use it, but i use wsl 2
[18:07:27] <eagles0513875> i have docker desktop setup to use WSL2 
[18:07:32] <eagles0513875> strange thing is network connectivity
[18:13:28] <akik> eagles0513875: you don't get name resolution at all in the containers? that's a problem :)
[18:13:47] <eagles0513875> correct
[18:14:01] <eagles0513875> strange thing is physical host has network connectivity as i wouldnt be on here 
[18:14:40] <[twisti]> eagles0513875: have you rebooted since installing and setting up the stuff ? because when i did the whole windows, docker and wsl, my networking in docker and linux was messed up until i rebooted 
[18:14:57] <[twisti]> there seems to be some issues with the installation process there
[18:14:59] <eagles0513875> [twisti] of course 
[18:15:05] <[twisti]> ok, just making sure
[18:15:15] <eagles0513875> i did earlier this week to install updates
[18:15:40] <akik> [twisti]: did you get the bug in wsl 2 that the windows home directory had wrong permissions when in wsl 2 ?

[18:20:21] <eagles0513875> try and see what is going on maybe its my desktop
[18:21:51] <akik> eagles0513875: the default installation should work but i can't tell you what's wrong
[18:22:04] <eagles0513875> i understand will keep you posted 
[18:22:13] <akik> i'm just a docker user
[18:22:29] <eagles0513875> im still learning using it for an interesting dev project of mine :)  
[18:22:36] <akik> but i use it on linux and now recently on wsl 2
[18:22:59] <akik> on wsl 2 i installed dockerd inside of wsl 2
[18:23:17] <eagles0513875> interesting didnt even think that was possible
[18:23:44] <akik> eagles0513875: it works but for service management you need to enable systemd in it
[18:23:57] <akik> eagles0513875: so it goes off the supported path quite quickly
[18:24:11] <eagles0513875> this is more for development for a project deployment will be a kubernetes cluster on linode
[18:24:19] <eagles0513875> security is what i worry about with containers the most
[18:25:12] <akik> i've built a development environment inside docker
[18:25:40] <akik> but now i'm starting to worry that my users install random pieces of software and they might contain malware
[18:26:08] <akik> like this: https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js/issues/536
[18:26:37] <eagles0513875> users as in developers?
[18:26:46] <eagles0513875> i think i found the missing piece of my puzzle btw
[18:27:00] <akik> eagles0513875: yes
[18:27:14] <eagles0513875> are the containers on their own vlan?
[18:27:17] <akik> eagles0513875: python development
[18:27:27] <eagles0513875> as that would protect the rest of your network if something does happen
[18:27:42] <akik> eagles0513875: well it's quite complicated. the containers are in a public iaas service
[18:28:06] <eagles0513875> so you offer iaas containers as part of your business or something of the sort
[18:28:49] <akik> eagles0513875: yes in the future. we're just a small company just now
[18:29:33] <akik> i know how linux works but i'm not a developer
[18:29:51] <akik> i've done system setups only my whole career
[18:30:17] <eagles0513875> regardless of this being for clients to use for development or not you dont want any lateral movement from malicious code from such vms to get into other systems of yours hence the vlan suggestion 
[18:30:55] <eagles0513875> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package
[18:31:06] <eagles0513875> think this is the step i missed potentially also on how to set default wsl version to 2
[18:31:07] <akik> eagles0513875: yes i've setup in place that uses userns-remap and AllowUsers in sshd_config
[18:31:31] <akik> eagles0513875: but of course there has to be access to databases and repositories
[18:31:31] <eagles0513875> there is also on the linux side freeipa and 389-ds
[18:31:38] <akik> eagles0513875: i use 389-ds
[18:32:11] <eagles0513875> i want to start using it plus free ipa
[18:32:41] <akik> i run it in the same environment in 2 docker containers. it was _ell to setup
[18:34:29] <eagles0513875> i can imagine 
[18:34:34] <akik> maybe freeipa would be easier?
[18:34:54] <akik> i've run this setup for 15
[18:34:58] <akik> 1.5 years now
[18:35:24] <eagles0513875> dunno to be honest usually freeipa goes hand in hand with 389ds
[18:35:28] <akik> co-workers write code that i have no idea how it works. all objects and interfaces in python

[19:39:24] <eagles0513875> im really not one happy chappy right now
[19:39:34] <eagles0513875> think ill use an external device to setup a vm on and use it to boot right into linux
[19:39:48] <endigma> vagrant->docker might work?
[19:40:00] <endigma> i know some windows required devs that use it that way
[19:40:09] <eagles0513875> the issue is the docker desktop
[19:40:19] <eagles0513875> i have one machine which im on now the containers have no network connectivity
[19:40:21] <endigma> yeah, docker desktop just runs hyperv
[19:40:28] <eagles0513875> yes and no
[19:40:33] <eagles0513875> the latest version has WSL2 support
[19:40:34] <artok> install virtualbox and then use docker-machine to provision the virtualbox vm
[19:41:02] <eagles0513875> its strange i have 2 different issues both with docker desktop
[19:41:06] <artok> it will install the dockerd on it and do all the thingies for you
[19:41:49] <eagles0513875> if im going to go for a vm ill stick with hyper-v on windows 10
[19:42:16] <endigma> you do you
