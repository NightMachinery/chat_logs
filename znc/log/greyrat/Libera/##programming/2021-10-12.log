[08:04:00] <vdamewood> And it's not really a flaw in the logic since it's mostly irrelevant. The point is, if you refuse a bullet-proof vest, you risk only your own health. If you refuse a vaccine, you risk others' health as well.

[08:10:03] <cncr04s> If you need the vax because you are at risk. Take it. I have no problem with that.
[08:10:07] <InPhase> cncr04s: If it happens that you already had Covid, like for sure with a test, then I'm not really going to scream from the mountaintops that you need a vaccine.  But it would probably be wise to consider a booster 6-9 months after the Covid case while this pandemic is still ongoing.
[08:10:32] <cncr04s> I will go to cvs tomorrow and get an antibody test
[08:10:51] <cncr04s> I've had it at least once, possibly twice
[08:10:55] <InPhase> cncr04s: But if you didn't have it, getting the vaccine is basically part of the contract for being part of society when dealing with something like this.
[08:12:38] <InPhase> If somebody's a hermit living off in the mountains, not really any vaccine needed I guess.  But if you're going to work with a bunch of people, going to crowded stores with people around, or in any other way aggregating around others, then you need to do your part to not spread it.  That's a pretty basic part of being a civilized member of society.
[08:12:52] <cncr04s> I work at home

[08:26:12] <cncr04s> if you feel you are at risk, thats fine
[08:26:32] <InPhase> The vaccine works WITH a good immune system, readying it to fend off the virus quickly so it can't get a foothold and spread.
[08:27:27] <PlanckWalk> If you're infected, you probably won't know it for a couple of days after you're able to infect others.
[08:27:59] <PlanckWalk> So "If I'm sick I wouldnt go out" isn't great for everyone around you.
[08:28:25] <InPhase> cncr04s: Maybe let's start with basics.  Do you think it matters if you contribute to spreading the virus?
[08:28:30] <PlanckWalk> It's the main reason this thing is a pandemic and SARS wasn't.

[10:12:03] <comet23> what's harmaline?
[10:12:07] <Hash> To the small minded, it's about 'who did more' or 'dick waving' or 'impressing others'.

[12:07:14] <vdamewood> Hash: Not really. Since a salt is just meant to protect against rainbow tables.
[12:07:21] <DnzAtWrk> but see, I may be outdated in my thinking too
[12:07:25] <DnzAtWrk> since websec is always evolving
[12:07:42] <Hash> If they have the salt, that defeats the purpose
[12:07:47] <DnzAtWrk> naw
[12:07:56] <vdamewood> Hash: No it doesn't.
[12:07:56] <DnzAtWrk> the purpose is to prevent using lookup tables for dictionary attacks basically
[12:08:05] <DnzAtWrk> well, not just dictionary attacks
[12:08:10] <DnzAtWrk> but also for scrambled nonsense I guess
[12:08:20] <vdamewood> Hash: Odds are no one has generated a rainbow table for a particular salt.
[12:08:21] <DnzAtWrk> by salting each hash individually, you need one look up table per password
[12:08:27] <DnzAtWrk> and those lookup tables are massive
[12:08:35] <Hash> It doesn't prevent against targeted attacks
[12:08:35] <DnzAtWrk> it would take forever to create one per user
[12:08:42] <DnzAtWrk> it does not, you are right

[12:09:01] <password> yeah their like 200GB easily
[12:09:17] <DnzAtWrk> speaking from experience you are

[12:09:30] <Hash> How long do you think it will take?

[12:09:49] <DnzAtWrk> that's why you enforce a minimum length on passwords

[12:10:19] <password> correct horse battery stapler
[12:10:20] <Hash> Regardless, if you have the salt, you can generate tables (why would you) or you can just brute the password.

[12:13:09] <pyzozord> it's strict in all the wrong places
[12:13:12] <Hash> A pepper can be used in addition to salting to provide an additional layer of protection. The purpose of the pepper is to prevent an attacker from being able to crack any of the hashes if they only have access to the database, for example, if they have exploited a SQL injection vulnerability or obtained a backup of the database.
[12:13:14] <vdamewood> Oh... another thing salts prevent is when multiple users use the same password they don't get the same hash.

[12:43:16] <vdamewood> as an INTJ, I don't belive in putting people into categories.
[12:43:31] <mrig> discrimination is a fine art.
[12:43:39] <vdamewood> (I'm kidding... of course INTJ's would categorize everyone)
[12:43:47] <DnzAtWrk> Speaking of dicrimination. Sometimes it is impossible not to
[12:43:50] <DnzAtWrk> like if you make games
[12:43:51] <mrig> nature does it harmonically.
[12:43:55] <DnzAtWrk> you can not possibly make everyone able to play it
[12:44:19] <vdamewood> DnzAtWrk: Depending on the game, sure, but there are still many ways people do so needlessly.
[12:44:25] <DnzAtWrk> of course
[12:44:37] <mrig> Discrimination is greatly missuses word in a world that is upside down. 
[12:44:43] <mrig> go figure.
[12:45:19] <vdamewood> DnzAtWrk: Not letting a paraplegic play a dance/rhythem game is quite different from requiring color vision in a physics puzzle game.
[12:45:28] <mrig> to discern and to be discerning is not a negative thing, that said, to know how to do so does not come easy.
[12:45:40] <DnzAtWrk> yepp, but vision is required in most games

[17:29:50] <mrig> sure you can use one, but the point made is that if you write yourself one, and it does not take that long, you can just keep using it.
[17:29:52] <pyzozord> you the whole point with "handmade hero" is DIY
[17:30:01] <pyzozord> s/you/yeah/
[17:30:01] <mrig> Yes that's it.
[17:30:14] <mrig> It aint hard is the key point.
[17:31:00] <mrig> faffing about with hacky workarounds in complicated systems however, is a real sinkhole.
[17:31:23] <pyzozord> yeah, the native setup would be trouble too if not for the great guide
[17:31:23] <Thedarkb-Desktop> vdamewood, I couldn't get it to work.
[17:31:36] <Thedarkb-Desktop> It was ages ago though and I was probably doing something stupid.
[17:31:43] <mrig> You are I think right, I should just focus on writing the linux layer, I would free up 4G of ram then :|
[17:31:50] <pyzozord> project setup and build system from my experience is kind of tough, may be even harder than the project itself
[17:32:17] <pyzozord> mrig: or just dualboot to windows
[17:32:28] <mrig> The first time, but I think that once you start thinking in therms of what is actually there, it gets to be quite simple.
[17:32:43] <[itchyjunk]> I didn't know walmart offered logistic solutions to businesses.

[17:32:52] <mrig> yes the dual boot, am getting a little bit pushed for disc space is why I've not leapt at that.
[17:33:00] <[itchyjunk]> I wonder if walmart wants to compete with the likes of Amazon on all fronts.
[17:33:19] <[itchyjunk]> Greatvalue VPS when?
[17:33:22] <pyzozord> mrig: you are using that disk space for your vm anyway
[17:33:41] <mrig> some but not quite as much, as it is on a qcow2 image.
[17:33:55] <pyzozord> oh right that's true
[17:34:05] <mrig> which does not use more than is written, thankfully.
[17:34:08] <pyzozord> but you can set the windows partition to be as big as what you use now qith qcow2
[17:34:19] <mrig> All the windows updates would be broken otherwise :|
[17:34:40] <[itchyjunk]> "delivery as a service" wtf/
[17:34:49] <mrig> That seems to break the windows updater, it will not budge when there is no headroom.
[17:34:49] <pyzozord> i think qcow2 doesn't shrink, so how big it is, is the biggest it ever was

[17:35:51] <mrig> Clever stuff.
[17:36:21] <pyzozord> I'm not sure but I think windows 7 20gb should be enough
[17:36:41] <mrig> Oh that is a thought, I could go windows 7, nice!

[17:38:05] <pyzozord> you can download win 7 online for free
[17:38:14] <mrig> Not sure if it was 60 or 30, 60 I think.
[17:38:38] <mrig> right yes, I could do that, will it go onto a USB as an installer?
[17:38:48] <mrig> Or would that need to be configured?

[20:48:32] <InPhase> The algorithm in the paper is just the simplest way to write a sort by not having to think much about the loop bounds.  It makes sense that it works, and should have some pedagogical advantages as a simple algorithm.

[22:48:17] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: It's not begging to focus your application efforts on positions that match your strengths.  It's actually increasing your odds.  What is tricky is matching your obtained position to your goals when your goals are not yet aligned with your strengths.  So if functional programming is already a strength, then that would be something to look for.
[22:48:20] <macaw> wuldor: Can you be very intelligent, but very unkind and uncaring?

[22:50:28] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: What I'm trying to say is that looking for "a job" is more of a mistake.  Hiring managers will usually smell when you're carpet bombing applications for "a job" and they will tend to keep looking at other applicants instead, hunting for the people with more clearly aligned interests.
[22:50:40] <Guest8547> "<wuldor> I don't buy that you can be intelligent and not wise." --> I meant intelligence purely as IQ test; in the general sense, yes, it is somewhat related to wisdom
[22:50:47] <macaw> Guest8547: I don't mean or want to be dishonest. It feels to me that if you care about others, you are less useful to a soulless (or even anti-soul) entity than a heartful person.

[23:31:17] <wuldor> macaw: Qabbalism isn't Hebraic, it's pagan and comes from the european renaissance, it is just a Jewish name, the Kabbalah is Jewish. It a system of western occultism and derives a shows a lot of truth and is the basis of the Tarot. It is actually, in it's most modern form and Jesuit-English masonic formalization.
[23:31:36] <Jackal-o-lantern> Guest8547: I believe it's just the way the transformation is defined. But to be honest, I'm not 100% sure.

[23:40:43] <Guest8547> no, morphing is a fader....
[23:40:45] <Jackal-o-lantern> Guest8547: when you do homography, you have a matrix (3x3 size) which you apply to every coordinate of one image to map it to some location / transformation on the other image. 
[23:41:22] <Jackal-o-lantern> (this is after you've done all of the other stuff to actually create that matrix, which I've done and confirmed it all worked using test cases)

[23:44:51] <Jackal-o-lantern> So if you use the feature 'unified transform' or 'skew' even, basically those changes, they can be thought of as the untransformed image, and modify each pixel by this H matrix. 
[23:45:07] <Jackal-o-lantern> Each H matrix can describe a different transform.

[23:58:57] <ri> Hey there everyone, I've been wondering how to structure an application I'm developing. Say, I have two services, that technically do depend of each other. I'm developing them in a way there can be multiple of each one (in clustering) for extra availability, but with this I've been wondering how to make each component communicate with each other.
[23:58:57] <ri> An option has been using pub/sub with Redis, but I want to assign tasks to only one worker of each service, and I want to make sure message do reach somewhere, even in case one of the services is temporarily unavailable. Any ideas what could I use for this? I've been considering using something like RabbitMQ but I'm not sure how well would it work
[23:58:57] <ri> for my use-case.
