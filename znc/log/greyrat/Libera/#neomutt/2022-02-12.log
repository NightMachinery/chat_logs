[00:58:23] <eblake> among others, my rc has: bind index < vfolder-window-backward, folder hook . 'push <coollapse-all><last-entry><half-up>', and bind index,pager \Co sidebar-open
[00:59:34] <eblake> when I hit \Co to open a different sidebar, the symptoms are that I get 'open folder: ollapse-all><exit><vfolder-window-backward><last-entry><half-up>' show up in the bottom row, waiting for more input
[01:00:12] <eblake> so I suspect your changes to <sidebar-open> are borking the push queue, and trying to treat <collapse-all> as a literal '<' and 'c'
[01:30:02] <bluejaypop> hello, if I want to move an email coming from 'x' sender such as alerts@vendor.com to a directory called Vendor-X is it possible with folder hooks ? or how could be done this ?

[02:07:25] <bluejaypop> zsw, gotcha, thanks
[02:07:55] <zsw> something like, save-hook '~f alerts@vendor.com'  =Vendor-X
[02:09:18] <zsw> if you want the mail sorted to the Vendor-X dir, then you can use a fetch mail program.  I use fdm, fwiw.

[02:34:57] <eblake> and I'm having a hard time bisecting - when I built every single patch in the series, I could not reproduce the problem with a fresh start of neomutt, so there may be something more at play here :(

[02:38:40] <eblake> and now that I've just rebuild 5436a96, I'm not hitting it in what I was testing, which means my bisect was suspect because I don't have a 100% reproducer yet :(
[02:39:12] <flatcap> I can't reproduce it, but I think I know what's gone wrong
[02:40:13] <flatcap> the sidebar functions don't exist in the Pager's table of functions...
[02:40:33] <flatcap> that's fine when you're *in* the pager, because it delegates to the sidebar, but...
[02:40:51] <eblake> aha, you're right. I was trying to reproduce while showing just the index; but if I open the pager, the problem reappears
[02:41:14] <flatcap> if you <push> sidebar commands in when outside, they're not being recognised
[02:41:32] <flatcap> damn, damn, damn
[02:42:51] <eblake> well, at least I have a short-term workaround - revert to the earlier commit, or close my pager before I switch to a new folder using my sidebar
[02:43:24] <eblake> and with that, I'm off for the weekend...

[15:20:02] <dcpurton> (for me)
[15:22:36] <flatcap> in your comment I see "emoji" and "plain"
[15:22:44] <flatcap> (in firefox)
[15:24:04] <flatcap> oh, but I have seen github messing with the characters that I typed in...
[15:24:06] <dcpurton> Ah I use Chromium
[15:24:28] <flatcap> that's why sometimes I've `backticked` the chars to prevent emoji-fication
[15:24:45] <dcpurton> I have also seen Chromium have trouble with emojis

[16:23:15] <Rodon> yes
[16:23:20] <flatcap> in the browser, you can 't' tag files
[16:23:59] <Rodon> it means its impossible to select multiple files...
