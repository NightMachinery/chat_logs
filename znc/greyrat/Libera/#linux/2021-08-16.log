[00:03:13] <ciphrCat> ayecee: exFAT is supposedly an improvement over older FAT filesystems, but AFAIK the only pitfall is that it may be too new for some OSs to be able to handle it
[00:03:28] <TJ-> VlanX: where XXXX is one of top, modules, premount, mount, mountroot, bottom, init
[00:03:28] <ciphrCat> so it's mainly a question of whether win7 stock can handle exFAT

[00:24:04] <nova> so, I went on a minimalist linux journey. I first tried nixos. It's interesting but too niche and seems like it could lead to a lot of annoying package management stuff. I tried gentoo, but I coudln't even install it because of annoying circular dependencies during install and after 2 days I gave up. I reinstalled arch (the only distro I have ever used) because I was desperate (I had to use gentoo

[00:48:27] <ciphrCat> hodapp: what happened is a of course central to the report.  But quoting the law supports the report because the agency doesn't have the full legal code memorized

[00:51:22] <ciphrCat> hodapp: it's very typical for a regulatory agency to be lazy.. to respond vaguely with "no laws were broken that fall in our purview".  Then I have to write back and say "hold one, what about 12 U.S.C section yada yada?"  Citing the laws and quoting them compels their response to be more refined

The full SELinux error is this: https://paste.centos.org/view/48aef982 ; my sshd config is https://paste.centos.org/view/de6458e4 ; lastly, the results of `semanage export` https://paste.centos.org/view/85945c32 . Cockpit does suggest creating a local policy, but I feel like my system is broken somehow. That should
[02:18:33] <Sabinno> not be necessary, because no one else seems to have problems with this.

[05:08:01] <matsaman> since macOS doesn't come with a proper one
[05:08:13] <Psi-Jack> matsaman: Being UNIX doesn't mean it comes with everything.
[05:08:22] <matsaman> and naturally the packages tend to be less macOS specific and more generic Unixy
[05:08:40] <matsaman> Psi-Jack: no, but it means saying it lags behind windows in being less unixy is kinda pointless
[05:08:47] <matsaman> that's all =P
[05:09:16] <Psi-Jack> And homebrew is simply a 3rd party repository and compiling system for various apps that can come with macOS and others that do not.
[05:09:29] <Kel> Windows doesn't really have a package manager in that sense either. Or, well... it didn't until the Windows Store, but even then that's not quite the same as like.. Aptitude.

[08:44:30] <Tiktalik> alright, i've installed arch linux for myself, linux mint for my dad, the quest to persuade my sister to install linux is still in progress
[08:44:31] <rascul> bash: neshpion: Permission denied
[08:44:58] <Tiktalik> but i'm at the hardest challenge yet
[08:44:59] <rascul> Tiktalik are you going to provide support for the rest of your/their lives?
[08:45:19] <Tiktalik> rascul: i was doomed to do so from the start. at least on linux i know how
[08:45:23] <neshpion> you think that wasn't already the case?
[08:45:40] <Tiktalik> if they moved to windows 8 or 10 i'd be fucked and honestly none of them want to
[08:46:01] <rascul> when family asks me for windows help i just tell them i have no idea how to use windows
[08:46:09] <neshpion> my family moved to windows 10.  hopefully windows 11 will bring them over to the freedom land
[08:46:11] <[[R]]> rascul: what's a window
[08:46:12] <rascul> it's not a lie, either
[08:46:33] <rascul> [[R]] it's one of those gaping holes that idiots put into perfectly good walls
[08:46:51] <Tiktalik> anyway, the hardest challenge yet is figuring out which linux version to give my mother
[08:46:55] <rascul> turns out people tend to cover them up so they're kind of pointless
[08:47:04] <rascul> Tiktalik 1.2 was the best linux version
[08:47:09] <Tiktalik> linux distro*
[08:47:11] <neshpion> Tiktalik: shouldn't she just have the same as your dad? they could swap notes
[08:47:15] <rascul> oh, distro
[08:47:20] <Tiktalik> no, they're completely different classes of user
[08:47:28] <rascul> probably gentoo or maybe print out an lfs book for them
[08:47:38] <Tiktalik> my dad uses his computer as a browser launcher
[08:47:48] <Tiktalik> i'm not even entirely sure he would notice that i installed mint if i hadn't pointed it out
[08:47:49] <rascul> my dad maintains his own opensuse
[08:48:18] <Tiktalik> especially since i put everything back in the same places, roughly, afterward
[08:48:23] <neshpion> i'm comfortable knowing that nobody but me knows how to use my computer because there's just a wallpaper, a statusbar, and everything has to be accessed through dmenu or obscure key combinations
[08:48:48] <Tiktalik> that was my favorite kind of security for a while!
[08:49:11] <neshpion> i feel like biff with his car that "nobody can drive but me"
[08:49:25] <Tiktalik> anyway, so, my mother's picky as hell, complains lots, real pain in the ass type
[08:49:33] <Tiktalik> i'm thinking kde
[08:49:33] <TJ-> neshpion: until it's rebooted with "single" on the kernel command line :)
[08:49:49] <Tiktalik> because with kde, if she complains about some shit, then she can change it
[08:50:26] <neshpion> my mother is the same way, and it's one of the reasons i hesitate to evangelize her
[08:51:08] <Tiktalik> she complains every time firefox updates and changes their look
[08:51:12] <Tiktalik> which i think is fair
[08:51:46] <TJ-> Tiktalik: when was the last time she redecorated the house or replaced the curtains? :)
[08:52:03] <TJ-> Tiktalik: I generally find those are correlated
[08:52:12] <Tiktalik> a while ago!
[08:52:31] <neshpion> if by decorate you mean leave piles of things around....
[08:53:35] <Tiktalik> anyway
[08:53:55] <Tiktalik> i'd love to give her arch
[08:54:01] <Psi-Jack> Don't do it.
[08:54:03] <Tiktalik> but i don't think there's a way in hell i could talk her into that
[08:54:27] <Tiktalik> so i'm thinking either fedora kde or kubuntu
[08:54:49] <Psi-Jack> Well, Fedora KDE is newer than current Kubuntu.

[13:22:12] <n4dir> either "I ssh'd to .." or "i am ssh'ing to ", is what seems to be used usually in my little world
[13:22:35] <Samian> I just read this: "Sometimes the system that you are deploying on is not your desktop system. For example, if you use a GPU cluster or a cloud system such as Amazon EC2, and you only have terminal access to the machine."
[13:22:43] <Samian> https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-nvprof-your-handy-universal-gpu-profiler/
[13:22:47] <n4dir> but sure not "I'm ssh'd "
[13:22:48] <Samian> so they call it "terminal access"
[13:23:24] <geirha> if the audience is windows users, that probably works better
[13:23:52] <Samian> this is interesting: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line/

[14:47:09] <RayTracer> however, it's on sda3 (/ is on sda2) which is odd, and you could check if you need a separate /boot at all

[14:51:09] <RayTracer> aakashi2001: you basically only need a separate /boot if you have a setup on / that cannot be reached by the boot loader (most likely grub2). So, if you don't have a fancy file system or other setup, it is likely that you don't require a separate /boot at all.

I can control the opacity as a whole with picom.conf for urxvt, like if it's very opaque, then I barely see the text, and if I set only little opaque, then also the background of the terminal is showing and not the things behind it.

[16:21:31] <DPA> RayTracer: I have multiple use-cases for it, but the main fing I would like to do is to have a nicer means for exchanging / piping structured programs between programs, especially in but not limited to shells.
[16:21:31] <DPA> Consider terminal utilities such as ip, host/dig, etc. If I just call them, or pipe them to grep, I am interested in human readable output.
[16:21:31] <DPA> However, if I try to do anything with the data in a script, or if I want to pipe "ip | jq" or "ip | csvsql", I certainly want a machine readable data format which all tools involved support.
[16:21:31] <DPA> The end goal is having consistent, seamless, means to negotiate data formats between tools, for the purpose of easy & fault free processing of structured data in shell scripts, without having to search for options
[16:21:31] <DPA> such as --json in ip, and without ever having to grep to extract a field or do other error prone parsing in tools which don't have such an option, and so on.

[17:11:36] <epistax> I see an issue with a particular driver (microchip 8795) on my rev (4.14.149) where at a kernel tick of 1000 Hz.. it doesn't work (it does at 100 Hz). We could be moving to 5.4 or 5.10 soon, but I haven't seen anything in bugzilla but I also may not be searching effectively, or perhaps the bug isn't in the driver but in something the driver depends on. Any suggestions on how to search effectively? Thanks
[17:11:46] <Psi-Jack> preceding, and yes! That doesn't give red squiggly lines.

[18:25:45] <lopid> if you run a memory intensive program, you'll see your memory usage increase. when you close that program, you may or may not see the usage go back, because some things are held in cache. that doesn't mean your memory isn't and won't become available to new processes as and when it's needed
