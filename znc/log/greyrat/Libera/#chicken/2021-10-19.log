[10:24:40] <sjamaan> So it's either fix openssl for C4 (possibly less work, but messy and in the long run not so useful) or get Ugarit up to C5 (more work, but more future proof)

[16:19:08] <Guest-liao> I built a small executable code.
[16:20:13] <Guest-liao> The code is from part of lolevel-tests.scm file
[16:27:21] <Guest-liao> is that a cookbook for macro in scheme?

[16:41:45] <Guest-liao> Thanks. Let me check.
[17:04:15] <Guest-liao> Whatever syntax-rules and ir-macro-transformer, I mean it is possible to expand macro. Take that piece of expand code to debug.
[17:04:32] <Bunny351> use ",d" in csi
[17:04:32] <Guest-liao> Not really debug macro.
[17:04:39] <Bunny351> ahem, ",x"
