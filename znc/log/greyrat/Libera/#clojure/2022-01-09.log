[21:43:51] <nij-> How to get Pomegranate on my classpath by default in lein, as required here? https://github.com/clj-commons/pomegranate
[21:44:25] <nij-> I've put `[clj-commons/pomegranate "1.2.1"]` in ~/.lein/profiles.clj
[21:53:54] <Para> like this? https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/PROFILES.md#default-profiles
[21:54:22] *** Joins: rito_ (~rito_gh@45.112.243.149)
[21:54:24] <Para> What are you going to do with pomegranate, btw?
[21:56:00] <nij-> I'm trying to be able to load libraries in a repl at any time, without a well defined project.
[21:56:42] <Para> Add this to your profile instead :) https://github.com/avescodes/lein-try
[21:57:15] <Para> (useful adage here: come with a problem, not with a broken solution)
[21:58:07] <nij-> Para: I see that `lein try` works before I jack into the repl (when I was still in the terminal).
[21:58:29] <nij-> Can it work as well when I'm already in the repl?
[21:58:47] <Para> Can't answer that, I've never even opened emacs.
[22:00:07] <nij-> Lets not say emacs, but just a repl in the terminal. When you had `lein repl` and are in a clojure repl, and you want to load a library, how would you do that?
[22:00:24] <Para> lein try what/ever 1.2.3
[22:01:02] <Para> Just like its docs say :)
[22:01:09] <nij-> user> (lein try [what/ever "1.2.3"])  ;; something like this?
[22:01:22] <Para> Nope, just directly run the command.
[22:01:29] <Para> There's no need to trying to cram into a single REPL.
[22:01:49] <Para> Lein try spawns its own REPL (or probably hooks into running one if there's .nrepl-port file present, haven't tested)
[22:02:07] <nij-> Yes, so what I want is to do this after I'm already in the repl.
[22:02:19] <Para> That's generally not how JVM works.
[22:02:25] <nij-> But lein try is a nice tool too. Thanks for sharing!
[22:02:28] <nij-> !! 
[22:03:02] <nij-> pomegranate also had this warning too in its readme. But I don't fully understand that. Why isn't this work well with JVM?
[22:03:17] <Para> JVM is really sucky at dynamic loading of things, which various libraries and ecosystems, most failing, exist for that reason. Majority of Clojure's core code is around reloading Clojure code itself.
[22:04:09] <Para> JVM stars with a known classpath, the classpath is resolved by classloaders which form a hierarchy with some very complex semantics; these also control JIT and various other plumbing processes within JVM.
[22:04:16] <nij-> I see :( Thanks for letting me know! It's very important. I have better change my mindset when I'm clojuring.
[22:04:55] <nij-> I came from CL where things can be done on the fly easily. Kinda get used to it. So it is an important point to learn :)
[22:04:57] <Para> https://www.baeldung.com/java-classloaders
[22:05:24] <Para> and also again Wikipedia seems to have an OK article about this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Classloader
[22:05:51] <Para> Clojure itself can hot reload just fine inside REPL, but that's because Clojure has its own class loader implementation.
[22:06:23] <Para> Sort of ironic is that Clojure probably wouldn't do proper class reloading if its class loader was JVM spec compliant, but that's going way too deep into JVM internals...
[22:07:11] <Para> There's also the modulepath these days but Clojure doesn't really use that so we have been able to ignore it for a few years now :)
[22:10:52] <TimMc> nij-: When I was using Clojure for development at work, I ignored CIDER and other editor integrations entirely.
[22:12:05] <TimMc> My approach was to keep a REPL running, make edits in the editor, and then use (require 'what.ever.namespace :reload) and try making some calls against the updated code.
[22:12:38] <TimMc> It's probably very slightly slower but more liberating.
[22:13:20] <TimMc> (If CIDER works, that's great, but if it breaks, this is another approach to take if you just need to get some work done dammit.)
[22:16:15] <ridcully> nij-: the place to put this dep for pomegranate in ~/.lein/profiles.clj is under :user :dependencies

[22:58:51] <nij-> TimMc: so you mean you can evaluate what you have in a file on the fly with a running REPL? Why not using CIDER then?

[23:47:15] <technomancy> you can do editor integration without full-on cider ide type features
[23:47:39] <technomancy> like ... just a key binding to run (require '[whatever :reload]) is super useful and a lot more stable/simple than cider
