[00:54:45] <michigan> weaksauce: yep
[00:55:13] <michigan> i wanted to do `rails new` in this case but got `Errno::EACCES: Permission denied @ rb_file_s_rename - (/home/apps/.gem/ruby/2.7/cache/rake-13.0.6.gem, /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7/cache/rake-13.0.6.gem)`
[00:56:01] <michigan> seems the solution is to run `rails new myapp --skip-bundle`, then enter myapp and do `bundle install --path /home/apps/.bundle/`
[00:56:11] <michigan> awesome!
[00:58:32] <weaksauce> nicely done

[01:05:51] <michigan> actually `bundle config set path /home/apps/.bundle/`seems easier so I don't have to set the path every time I wanna add a new gem
[01:06:55] <michigan> and  dont have to run --skip-bundle and manually run bundle and rails webpacker:install afterwards
[01:07:02] <weaksauce> michigan once you set it is always that way for that repo
[01:07:08] <weaksauce> er directory
[01:07:21] <weaksauce> but yeah if you do it as a bundler config it should be global
[01:07:21] <michigan> yep
[01:07:35] <michigan> high five man! we prevailed at last
[01:07:47] <weaksauce> ^5
[01:07:56] <michigan> hehe
[01:12:40] <michigan> i wonder why https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install doesn't show you how to do local user install though
[01:24:01] *** Joins: ur5us (~ur5us@2406:e002:6b40:5201:1e1c:afed:873a:e5e4)
[01:24:51] <weaksauce> i think npm and yarn all default to local packages typically 
[01:25:04] <weaksauce> which also blows up the space requirements 
[01:25:43] <weaksauce> and then installing a global package overrides anything in your local lockfile... i can't imagine the thought process there 
[01:25:52] <aesthetikx> yeah that never made sense to me
[01:26:09] <weaksauce> in no other system have i seen something like that 
[01:26:28] <aesthetikx> for any given version of any given package, aside from yanks, it should just be installed in /var/cache/bignodeboy/ or whatever
[01:26:52] <weaksauce> maybe a mechanism to override packages if you specify it but to have that be the default for just installing it globally is backwards 
[01:27:11] <weaksauce> and yeah not to mention it should just be in one place and setup paths for it 
[01:27:18] <weaksauce> you know... like bundler does
[01:27:25] <aesthetikx> yeah
[01:28:04] <aesthetikx> i always find it entertaining when people praise cargo as like the first good dependency manager
[01:28:15] <aesthetikx> like, we've been in bundler nirvana for years

[01:28:57] <weaksauce> pip and environment management is terrible on that side of the fence 
[01:29:17] <weaksauce> yarn and npm are about as broken as you'd expect from javascript world
[01:29:49] <aesthetikx> i feel like yarn was supposed to fix npm and then just became npm 1.3
[01:29:52] <aesthetikx> not quite a 2.0
[01:30:21] <weaksauce> the crew that brought you oh lol you mean you can't let people delete packages that are widely used and then have some other person pick up that name and shut down the internet for a day 
[01:30:25] <weaksauce> yeah
[01:30:41] <weaksauce> also the same crew that thought lpad was worth making a package for 
[01:32:59] <michigan> it seems i can install node modules locally with nvm: https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/
[01:33:13] <michigan> the guys in #node.js talk a lot of trash about yarn :)
[01:33:26] <michigan> do we really need yarn?
[01:33:44] <weaksauce> i think facebook thought it was a #big improvement# 
[01:33:51] <weaksauce> made some stuff faster 
[01:35:19] <weaksauce> i don't really know though as they both seem lame
[01:35:40] <aesthetikx> yarn i would say is for sure better,
[01:35:52] <aesthetikx> at the time at least, or maybe by default, npm didn't have like the concept of a lock file
[01:35:59] <aesthetikx> there may have been that shrinkwrap thing or whatever
[01:36:14] <aesthetikx> but can you imaging lol just getting random versions of packages every time you clone a repo
[01:36:34] <weaksauce> homebrew comes to mind
[01:36:36] <weaksauce> yeah
[01:37:11] <weaksauce> his famous tweet "lol google didn't hire me but 90% of their engineers use my software" 
[01:37:19] <weaksauce> yeah i use it but it's not great
[01:37:58] <aesthetikx> homebrew makes me want to scream
[01:38:14] <aesthetikx> I don't use osx unless i really have to, but often have to use homebrew on a friends computer or whatever
[01:38:33] <aesthetikx> understandably osx is like a hostile developer environemnt so I give it some slack but its still a nightmare
[01:38:39] <aesthetikx> that tweet is funny though
[01:38:42] <weaksauce> yeah it's pretty bad
[01:39:00] <weaksauce> i guess it's better than installing it by hand
[01:39:55] <weaksauce> marginally... now i'm on an unsupported version of osx and it compiles every package from scratch instead of downloading a cached build 
[01:39:56] <michigan> so really we should just use yarn for now?
[01:40:18] <michigan> #node.js talks trash about haml and coffeescript too.. but i tend to agree with that :)
[01:40:19] <weaksauce> so cool updating youtube-dl now takes 5 hours 
[01:40:27] <weaksauce> because it has to recompile python
[01:40:34] <weaksauce> argh
[01:42:23] <aesthetikx> I use yarn, yeah
[01:42:33] <aesthetikx> also cofeescript was cool
[01:42:46] <aesthetikx> haml is also gods gift to this earth and I will not accept any other opinion
[01:42:52] <weaksauce> haml is ok
[01:43:00] <aesthetikx> and last time I checked hamlit was the fastest ruby templating language
[01:43:10] <aesthetikx> so thats a bonus

[02:00:11] <aesthetikx> embrace, extend , ...
[02:01:27] <rg1> yeah it could go either way but at this rate MS will own a lot of the stack developers rely on.

[06:13:48] <aesthetikx> you could have been if __self__ == __main__ing

[06:18:38] <aesthetikx> true
