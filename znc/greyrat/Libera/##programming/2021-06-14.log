[02:40:29] <Izem> I'm interested in making a word frequency counter, if I do not have a hash table, what would be the next best data structure?
[02:43:41] <InPhase> If you want a "data structure", you can maybe use an alphabetical bucket tree?  They're pretty conceptually.
[02:44:06] <InPhase> If you want to do it relatively fast without a hash table, you could maybe just make a vector of all the words, sort them, iterate and count.

[02:46:15] <InPhase> Izem: The alphabetical bucket one is not very space efficient though.  It's only nice on paper.  You could maybe do some sort of binary tree, although that's not much better than sorting after the fact.

I feel that knowing C would have been beneficial for understanding e.g. Rust properly. I know that I don't want to write pure C code unless it's an absolute must, but being able to interface with existing C code and, of course, being able to read it in the first place is a must for any engineer.

[04:58:24] <adder`> vdamewood, But is there something in common for those stacks? For example, is there a dedicated piece of memory for storing a stack that makes stacks faster than heaps, or does the difference in speed come from theoretical aspects of a stack?
[04:59:08] <vdamewood> There's no dedicated memory for the stack, no.
[04:59:33] <vdamewood> After all, on the x86, memory is just chunks of 4k mapped to a virtual space.

[05:02:32] <vdamewood> but whenever you access memory on the stack, you basically access it as stackpointer + offset, where as a heap is a tree structure with tree lookup and such.
[05:02:58] <tree> You’ve found me. Thanks for looking me up.
[05:03:30] <vdamewood> Though, in C, if you have a pointer to an object on the stack and an object on the heap, whichever one is faster will have more to do with cache lines and predictions and such.

[11:33:39] <mrig> depp: when I think of an ordinal I think of a geometry and an axis; Is this wrong?
[11:34:09] <mrig> so a ring would be perhaps more fundamental than that, it being just one spoke or branch perhaps.
[11:34:20] <deniska> unless you build a computer yourself using relays, how can you be sure what's really in it?
[11:34:49] <deniska> (electromechanical ones, not this funky solid state business)
[11:35:01] <depp> mrig: there are two types of numbers: cardinal and ordinal. Cardinal is counting numbers, "how many"--0, 1, 2, 3. Ordinals are "what place in the list"--1st, 2nd, 3rd.
[11:35:37] <depp> mrig: If you are just counting finite numbers, then ordinals and cardinals are the same. Once you get to non-finite numbers, they become different.

[11:38:09] <mrig> ties in nicely with the intset that I'm working on at the moment, because inside it has divisions that are worked with due to the size of the type etc, that relate to position or ordinate, and from these the value can be then calculated.

[12:24:47] <nifl> lavadonut what r u talking about
[12:24:53] <amigojapan> archie: there is a collection of libraries called boost for advanced c++users
[12:24:58] <depp> iostream suuuuuuuucks
[12:25:22] <EdFletcher> also you don't "import" it considering it's part of the standard library

[12:25:42] <depp> those are really the only two I know of
[12:25:54] <vdamewood> archie: For the most part, there isn't really a standard way to package or 'import' libraries in C++. It varies quite a bit from platform to platform.
[12:25:57] <amigojapan> Right you don't import in C++ you include
[12:26:09] <Inline> usually you #include them (shared ones, as in you rely on them being present in the system where the package gets installed to) or you put the ones you need to a directory relative to your project directory and instruct your IDE and your makefiles accordingly

[12:27:23] <amigojapan> vdamewood: why don't they include boost with c++?
[12:27:26] <Inline> i.e. when you have specific versions of libraries local in your project you rely on specific versions, but you can also override that, i.e. take default of the local ones and also search if there are newer ones in the target system

[12:27:48] <amigojapan> xeno: not sure
[12:27:52] <depp> amigojapan: boost is not really high-quality enough to land in C++. Sometimes, bits and pieces of it ARE high-quality enough, and those parts get included in the C++ standard

[12:33:37] <archie> I'm surprised that there are several package managers (conan and vcpkg for instance, what's different between?) and nothing central like npm, maven, composer, nuget, pip and so on...
[12:33:48] *** Joins: tsujp (~tsujp@sourcehut/user/tsujp)
[12:34:08] <deniska> archie: there's ton of various environments and compilers for C++
[12:34:14] <PlanckWalk> Allegro is older than SDL
[12:34:24] <depp> archie: JavaScript has both NPM and Yarn
[12:34:35] <vdamewood> archie: Well, most of those are specific to a single implementation. C++ has many implementations.
[12:34:39] <depp> Python has a few as well
[12:34:46] <deniska> archie: java, node, python have a single popular implementation each
[12:35:01] <depp> https://github.com/52doho/vcpkg-vs-conan
[12:35:03] <vdamewood> node is itself an implementation for that matter.
[12:35:14] <depp> And yet there are two popular package managers for Node
[12:35:28] <deniska> they both use a single repository format though
[12:35:40] <depp> Sure
[12:35:55] <depp> They're different on the client-side
[12:36:08] <deniska> it's like how on debian you have both apt and apt-get
[12:36:35] <depp> hm, except if they conflicted with each other
[12:36:45] <depp> if you try to use both Yarn and NPM at the same time they will fight
[12:36:46] <archie> depp true, but yarn fetches from npm repositories, basically any public package comes from there
[12:37:05] <deniska> depp: heh, well, I'm not too familiar with node infrastructure
[12:37:06] <Inline> erm not only that, some libs in npm are yarn dependent
[12:37:10] <deniska> I always used npm with node

[12:37:18] <Inline> so if you pull some you might be forced to switch
[12:37:32] <amigojapan> vdamewood: can you make non X graphical frame buffer programs using SDL?
[12:37:43] <Inline> and so deal with npm/yarn incompatibles to some degree
[12:37:47] <depp> ideally it doesn't matter what your dependencies use, you can use Yarn or NPM, your dependencies just need package.json
[12:37:57] <Inline> incompatibleness*
[12:37:59] <archie> depp true
[12:38:11] <vdamewood> amigojapan: You mean like using the Linux framebuffer? I'm not sure. I only ever used it to make apps in X11 or on other OSes.
[12:38:40] <amigojapan> vdamewood: I would like to make alternatives to X
[12:38:51] <archie> depp as far I can see, conan supports more stuff and has more libraries, is that correct?
[12:38:59] <deniska> amigojapan: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/main/src/video directfb is one of the video backends
[12:39:00] <Inline> and also, what i observed is you have to be careful when using npm/yarn, cause there's some 
[12:39:11] <amigojapan> vdamewood: Allegro could tho
[12:39:18] <depp> archie: looks like vcpkg has ~1350 libraries conan has ~560 according to the comparison
[12:39:18] <deniska> also kmsdrm
[12:39:23] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Well, they're already developing Wayland.

[12:39:40] <vdamewood> And I think X11 is now down to just security patches.
[12:39:51] <vdamewood> (and maybe bug patches)
[12:40:10] <Inline> there's some redundancies involved, when you got a package on a toplevel, and it has a dependency on some other say toplevel package, then it pulls that package into it's own folder
[12:40:13] <depp> archie: might just start with vcpkg, because it is more straightforward. Means you're using CMake, though. Hope you're okay with CMake.
[12:40:26] <archie> depp but it says also binary packages, not sure what it means though
[12:40:42] <Inline> so you might end up having several same packages on top and deeper levels
[12:40:44] <depp> I assume that means prebuilt binaries
[12:41:07] <archie> depp have to take a look at it, of course
[12:41:12] <amigojapan> vdamewood: I mean a desktop that is oriented for smart phones and is less heavy than a full GUI like Wayland
[12:41:37] <depp> Wayland isn't a GUI though
[12:41:41] <deniska> amigojapan: wayland was literally initially developed as a GUI solution for phones :)

[13:10:00] <piou> password: it's nice. I've met very few websites over the years that didn't have an RSS feed. It frees a lot of time and mental stress by shifting your workflow from being notification based (ie: you keep being interrupted and must go to different websites to know what's up and that ends up taking a huge time) to having one place that collects all news when they come. You can go to your RSS reader
[13:10:06] <piou> whenever you want, you can even have it notify you if you really want, but you don't have to. Also it's invaluable for slow-updating websites like many quality blogs that may only post an article once every two months or so: you don't want to keep going to the website to know what's up, you don't want to give your email address to tons of people just to get more spam, RSS keeps it clean and
[13:10:12] <piou> organized and you're not going to miss on anything.

[14:54:22] <alycidyne> Hello, why are paths so adamantly mandated to be a whole string instead of a sequence of strings even in programming languages? e.g. "/path/to/file" vs ["","path,"to","file"]

[14:55:07] <alycidyne> I haven't seen the latter *anywhere*, has anyone else?
[14:55:25] <GeDaMo> It's probably because the OS routines take a string
[14:55:34] <GeDaMo> Also, not all OSs have subdirectories
[14:56:08] <amigojapan> alycidyne: that is just a difference in separator

[14:57:21] <alycidyne> amigojapan: no, because in the latter, the separator is not written in the path
[14:57:26] <GeDaMo> The filesystem is a namespace but the details vary across systems, a string is a fairly generic form
[14:57:41] *** Quits: dunkeln (~dunkeln@94.129.65.28) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[14:57:45] <beaky> yes it's not OSes that insist on it but apis with poorly defined paths whereas some libraries like common lisp's stdlib and rust are more careful to specify that pathnames are not strings and have operators to manipulate them like in common lisp it does have a list you can append for the directories
[14:57:57] <amigojapan> alycidyne: ah I think now I understand, you want to pass a list
[14:57:58] <GeDaMo> Better ways to abstract the details of the filesystem names would be nice
[14:58:22] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: in which case then, my question is probably why namespaces insist on including the separator as part of the notation
[14:58:37] <GeDaMo> Hysterical reasons, probably :P
[14:58:57] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: I know you meant historical, but I love what you wrote nevertheless :D
[14:59:09] <GeDaMo> It's a play on words :P

[14:59:27] <vdamewood> I preffer hysterical raisins
[14:59:54] <W> amigojapan, platform independence requires that you do not presume anything about path separators in the OS
[14:59:55] <GeDaMo> What you really want is something like open(FILENAME(LOCATION, NAME), ...
[15:00:15] <amigojapan> In Japanese Windows back Slash looks like the yen sing ¥, so perhaps look like c:¥path¥to¥file

[15:06:46] <halidyne> W: the whole stack
[15:07:06] <W> paths with separators exists so that a hierarchical system don't have to store ancestor data, and so that renaming a top level folder doesn't involve rewriting data for all its contents
[15:07:42] <W> specifically the separators exist because people interface with the OS through text, e.g. a shell
[15:07:49] <GeDaMo> Generally the files being processed are in a small number of locations, implicit (e.g. current directory) or a specified working directory
[15:07:59] <halidyne> W: correct, but a path is a sequence of names...

[15:09:04] <halidyne> W: One idea I have is editable crumbs
[15:09:05] <amigojapan> GeDaMo: more than the slash problem, I think the fact that Windows paths include a drive name makes the problem much more difficult
[15:09:50] <GeDaMo> Namespace details
[15:10:07] <W> the way Java treats that is to say that an OS might have multiple roots containing hierarchical file systems

[15:10:37] <amigojapan> I see w
[15:10:54] <halidyne> W: other than that, yes, a separator is acceptable, but only for that input element - in other words, parse into a sequence as early as possible
[15:10:57] <W> which, while not true at the /top/ level in e.g. Linux, can be abstracted to such in a variety of ways, e.g. sandboxes/encapsulations of various kinds, mount points, etc

[15:12:21] <alycidyne> Back again, connection keeps stopping randomly
[15:12:38] <W> alycidyne, I agree in principle; there should be separation between the hierarchical nature of a filesystem interface, and the interface that parses and combines paths
[15:13:10] <W> unfortunately, this would require all programmers involved in historical OS development and associated tooling to have extraordinary discipline
[15:13:46] <W> while, in reality, most systems and tooling have evolved from toys to serious tools in an incremental manner with a variety of motivation levels
[15:14:04] <alycidyne> Right, I was wondering whether there was some technical reason behind it
[15:15:02] <W> there's also a good /engineering/ argument for making the full path the canonical interface point, which is that it's the only way to get a consistent UI throughout
[15:15:41] <W> if everyone started out with structured paths in all APIs, you might have to learn which separator the config file for doom uses independent of learning what the DOS command line uses and so on
[15:16:12] <W> this is not so much a technical point but rather a point that helps sell an OS as user friendly
[15:16:32] <amigojapan> GeDaMo: is it true that applications on iOS can't access the directories in other apps as a way of enforcing security?
[15:16:42] <GeDaMo> Sorry, I have no idea
[15:16:52] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:16:59] <GeDaMo> vdamewood uses a Mac, I think
[15:17:03] <alycidyne> So it's somewhat the same reason (at least how I understand it) Unix uses a stream of bytes as the data format for pipes
[15:17:15] <mrig> alycidyne: you could always inverse the symmetry, go with a \ instead of a /, just for kicks and giggles? <- could this be an hysterical raisins?
[15:17:36] <GeDaMo> DOS used \ as a spearator
[15:18:12] <alycidyne> mrig: I actually think that \ is perhaps the least bad, because it isn't used in most names
[15:18:19] <vdamewood> What about my Mac?
[15:18:33] <amigojapan> Japanese Windows uses ¥ as a separateor

[17:04:57] <mrig> monopolising basic tools is always going to be a delicate area that is in essence self destructive, this is why I think that open source is emerging as the most viable long term solution.
[17:05:05] <sysRPL> also the programmability microsoft has added to office is far inferior to what they had in 2007
[17:05:24] <mrig> It has simply taken time for this to become apparent.
[17:06:11] <sysRPL> i had to research the new microsoft office add in programming workflow recent and came away with the impression is was absolutely terrible

[17:06:39] <mrig> I think that eventually we will see open source tooling that is better than the proprietary stuff, once programmers get tired of writing tools for programming because those have all been covered. 
[17:06:53] <pulse> lol
[17:07:13] <sysRPL> it made me think that although i was not a fan for com and vba, it was way better than the pile of crap they were putting out in 2016
[17:07:30] <mrig> blender and krita are both superb examples of this.

[17:09:01] <sysRPL> one pro tool that i think the foss community doesn't touch in terms of actually working is adobe premiere, the video editor

[20:40:11] <ishan> I was also about to suggest that but angel.co has lots of smaller companies.. Mostly early age startups 
[20:40:16] <ishan> but it's a decent option 
[20:40:59] <ishan> You didn't say what you wanted to do on a glassdoor like website.. However if you want to read reviews of a company, I'll suggest going to blind.. Anonymity is amazing for stuff like that... 
[20:41:15] <InPhase> CrtxReavr: If you're in the U.S., indeed.com
[20:41:20] <CrtxReavr> I'm being recruited pretty hard by this company, but I've never heard of them, and they're not listed on Glassdoor. . . hoping to read some employee reviews, etc.
[20:41:44] <ishan> Hmmm
[20:41:58] <InPhase> CrtxReavr: Note that on a smaller company, you're always up against a numbers problem getting reviews or getting a fair sampling.  If there are only a few reviews, you won't know if they're a fair representation anyway.
[20:42:03] <ishan> If you have a blind account, Ask there.. Angel.co is for basic information gathering only 
[20:42:43] <CrtxReavr> grtrrr
[20:43:00] <CrtxReavr> Why do so many sites purport to use SAML, but make you set a password?

[22:14:16] <Twipply> Now I realise I've never tried to ~ a float before
[22:14:16] <pyzozord> so first ~ does convert to int and bitwise negation and second ~ reverts the negation

[22:14:56] <pyzozord> oh yeah I could do that too I haven't thought of that one

[22:15:49] <pulse> it used to be faster than Math.floor too
[22:15:54] <pulse> but now it's the same afaik
[22:16:03] <pyzozord> yeah I use it because it's easier to type

[22:16:30] <pulse> yeah you're in JS
[22:16:32] <pulse> don't expect things
[22:16:48] <pyzozord> in real life code I wouldn't use it, most js devs are not experts in bitwise operations because they don't need to, and the ~~ trick is too tricky
[22:16:52] <pulse> also read https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md
[22:16:59] <pulse> it's hands down the best JS book
[22:17:33] <pulse> IMO ~~ isn't bad

[22:26:52] <pulse> but +'abcd' is NaN
[22:27:05] <pulse> +String() is also 0
[22:27:11] * pulse scratches head
[22:27:21] <pyzozord> String() evaluates to ''
[22:27:32] <pyzozord> so +String() is the same as +''
[22:27:44] <pulse> +false => 0, +true => 1

[22:28:09] <pulse> +'9' => 9
[22:28:17] <pulse> hmm
[22:28:27] <pulse> so +X is literally parseInt ?
[22:28:44] <pulse> except it works for floats too
[22:28:48] <pyzozord> no, it's Number(X), I think parseInt and Number() are different
[22:28:51] <pulse> yeah Number()
[22:28:53] <pulse> hmm
[22:29:00] <pulse> yeah parseInt outputs int

[22:29:33] <pyzozord> probably nothing, since all Numbers in javascript are 64 bit floats
