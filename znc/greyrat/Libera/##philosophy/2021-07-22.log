[12:30:52] <Samian> I'm tired of lies made through equivocation
[12:31:27] <Samian> Rafiki in the Lion King says Mufasa is alive and tells Simba "I'll show him to you". Then Rafiki reveals he was equivocating and that by "alive" he meant "see, he lives in you"
[12:32:04] <Samian> shifting the meaning of alive from having a beating hard and a brain with activity to the passing of your dna is 100% equivocation
[12:32:07] <Samian> it disgusts me
[12:32:15] <Samian> and the fact that it's in a Disney movie angers me even more
[12:32:31] <Samian> teaching kids that it's okay to equivocation and be slick with language like a trickster!

[17:14:20] <michigan> R.I.P. J Dilla aka the greatest hiphop producer that ever lived aka your favorite producer's favorite producer
[17:14:48] <amigojapan> Did he pass away?
[17:15:07] <michigan> he died feb 2006 from lupus - he made that song on his deathbed
[17:15:14] <michigan> in the hospital
[17:15:37] <michigan> no wait, not that album but the one after that iirc
[17:16:29] <michigan> havent listened to him in over 10 years, brings back  a lot of feelings
[17:17:22] * michigan starts to feel like he did back then - like he can take over the world
[17:18:52] * michigan didnt disappoint the 10 year younger michigan either - the world is very soon his - but thats another story
[17:19:26] <spruit11> yah,  I was watching some old stuff too today.  the more mainstream '90s techno.  Faithless,  Underworld,  Antiloop,  etc.  was good and somehow still sounds fresh to me
[17:21:21] <amigojapan> I am older so I watch 80s stuff
[17:21:21] <spruit11> seems like Antiloop only made two albums and I managed to know all the songs without ever buying them.  no idea how that happened

[18:19:22] <michigan> fuck a normal job. im never gonna have one again
[18:19:26] <DPA> The key to having a decent amount of money is to not use any of it.
[18:19:37] <michigan> using all my heart and soul to make somebody else rich - no thank you

[18:22:51] <amigojapan> Sounds sad michigan
[18:22:59] <michigan> im also gonna get tons of children all around the world - who knows - maybe that'll change my view of suicide

[18:29:30] <amigojapan> michigan: your ancestors want more people to keep on suffering? Doubtfull. They probably did not understand the situation. Also act for your descendants
[18:30:16] <amigojapan> michigan: that's just a very old way of thinking
[18:32:10] <amigojapan> michigan: also hard to find love with more than one person at a time
[18:32:34] <amigojapan> Jealousy is still a thing
[18:33:21] <DPA> The purpose of life is to stay alive and continue life. Having higher ideals than reproduction will select against people who think that way.
[18:33:31] <spruit11> polyamory is becoming a small thing here.
[18:34:02] <spruit11> if you believe in a purpose
[18:34:21] <amigojapan> DPA: or to take your own control over the situation and stop suffering at least in your blood line

[18:38:00] <spruit11> that sounds problematic
[18:39:55] <amigojapan> Yep
[18:40:33] <DPA> Reproduction is pointless if the children can't survive healthily. Thats partly why monogamy became a thing. It should create a stable environment in which a child can grow up safely.

[18:58:47] <amigojapan> spruit11: you need to develop trust in someone and it takes decades
[19:01:03] <DPA> Regarding polyamory, I like the idea. Less strong bonds, more flexibility, no being tied to someone speciffic. Generally, it's just a much more open and less restrictive social structure.
[19:01:03] <DPA> However, it's important everyone knows what is ok or not for whom, who does what, and that people agree on certain things, to avoid problems & conflicts.
[19:01:03] <DPA> Polyamory doesn't mean people have to want/get children. But if they decide to anyway, they still should make sure to secure who has which responsibilities, also legally, in advance.

[19:55:59] <amigojapan> DPA: it's penalty a lot less common than with men
[19:57:12] <amigojapan> Men tend to be more slaves to their sex drive
[19:58:48] <plankers> tell that to my ex
[20:00:16] <amigojapan> Women have more desire to have kids I think more than a sex drive
[20:01:02] <spruit11> *coughs very loudly*
[20:02:07] <amigojapan> But generalities don't always apply
[20:08:52] <amigojapan> A woman with a sex drive as strong as that of a normal young man would probably be considered a nynphonaniac
[20:09:42] <spruit11> dude,  I've had sex with milfs where afterwards I felt abused
[20:10:20] <spruit11> don't take that literally
