[00:25:43] <judybot> artefact: and static coverage doesn't help. Computers handle timing errors, out of order evaluation and other similar stylistic problems just fine.
[00:26:00] <Bayes> being more used to docstrings outside the function definition, having them within makes it feel a bit cluttered

[00:27:03] <Bayes> nucranium semantic sense in that your docstring is part of your function definition?
[00:27:14] <grym> `def foo():"""do foo stuff""" `
[00:27:26] <grym> i used to be used to outside
[00:27:30] <bpalmer> docstrings should be built up, acrostic style, from the first letters of the variables used in the function.
[00:27:33] <Catie> Within. And kept along with the environment the function was defined in
[00:27:35] <grym> both seem fine; pick the right idiom for the right language
[00:27:36] <artefact> """placeholder for now""" that never gets updated
[00:27:53] <bpalmer> if docstrings are too easy to read, then the wrong people might use your code.
[00:28:01] <nucranium> i guess that would be the semantic sense, what i was thinking though was more syntacial sense actually that the docstring is part of the AST node that it describes rather than floating off somewhere else

[01:34:41] <nucranium> i belive it does, yes johnjaye
[01:34:51] <dieggsy> johnjaye: yes, with wdired
[01:34:52] <johnjaye> ok. so i'll have to be careful then what i change
[01:35:20] <Bayes> I once did that, edited the dired buffer hoping it'd reflect on the disk but it didn't
[01:35:29] <dieggsy> johnjaye: you kind of have to intentionally enter wdired mode for file name changes though
[01:35:58] <nucranium> it will still happen if you are in the mode unintentionally to be pedantic
[01:36:02] <Bayes> thta day also learned the difference between marking and killing a line vs marking and deleting a line
[01:36:28] <dieggsy> Bayes: it definitely works, see - wdired-change-to-wdired-mode. I use it all the time
[01:36:32] <johnjaye> dieggsy: is wdired in the manual
[01:36:40] <johnjaye> or is it something the internet made up
[01:36:44] <johnjaye> i.e. in melpa
[01:36:44] <dieggsy> johnjaye: great
[01:36:51] <dieggsy> oh, you're asking?
[01:36:54] <Bayes> dieggsy didn't know of wdired at that point in time
[01:37:00] <johnjaye> it sounds like something you made up
[01:37:06] <nucranium> its in the dired manual
[01:37:10] <johnjaye> ok
[01:37:13] <johnjaye> emacs naming then
[01:37:14] <dieggsy> johnjaye: ???? it comes with emacs
[01:37:23] <dieggsy> why the hostility jaja
[01:37:40] <johnjaye> i'ts the periods. i read when you use periods that is perceived as 'hostile'
[01:38:12] <dieggsy> johnjaye: it wasn't the periods, it was "it sounds like something you made up" - why would i lie to you? in any case, no offence taken, i was making my comment lightly as well
[01:38:30] *** Quits: EndOfAnEra (~sphinx@user/businessclass) (Quit: quit enough about my bs)
[01:38:41] <johnjaye> normally emacs modes append to the name. like dired-x. hence my remark.
[01:38:41] <rpav> 🤔
[01:38:42] <nucranium> also the second person, using the second person alot makes sentences sound directed at the interlocutor and pointy
[01:39:03] <johnjaye> nucranium: yes! this is something i didn't know for awhile
[01:39:15] <nucranium> i have to improve on second person usage myself
[01:40:18] <nucranium> if were more normal to say 'one' in english it would be easier
[01:40:25] <Bayes> I use you meaning "one" quite often and half the time people believe I'm actually talking/asking about them individually :D
[01:40:37] <rpav> Bayes: yeah ;/
[01:40:37] <Catie> One could probably make it more common than it is
[01:40:39] <dieggsy> I actually use you meaning one all the time too, so
[01:40:42] <nucranium> yes exactly
[01:40:42] <dieggsy> i wouldn't worry about it too much lol
[01:40:59] <nucranium> (yes exactly, Bayes)
[01:41:10] <rpav> Bayes: i'm used to (subculturally?) using "you" as the general "you"
[01:41:28] <rpav> and having some kind of obvious distinction when you mean you and not you
[01:41:44] <Bayes> I prolly need to switch to one
[01:41:44] <Catie> Honestly I'll probably start using "one" more. It helps resolve an ambiguity in the language, a good and righteous thing

[01:50:30] <grym> it's really good
[01:50:37] <nucranium> emphasis on killer
[01:51:24] <rpav> howso .. regular dired can recursively kill things, but wdired can basically just change names and (if you explicitly set the option, which you should) permission modes
[01:51:53] <rpav> and most usefully this works both with multiple-cursors and _on symlink targets_
[01:51:58] <grym> wgrep, too :)
[01:52:15] <rpav> wait, wgrep?

[02:50:53] <e1f> it maynot be emacs but rather the terminal
[02:51:01] <johnjaye> at least it accepts escape F5
[02:51:19] <johnjaye> yeah. i want my init.el to work in both terminal and gui.
[02:51:26] <johnjaye> trying to keep it minimal
[02:51:32] <Catie> Think it might be something like this? https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-ctrlalt
[02:52:28] <johnjaye> oh interesting catie
[02:52:36] <johnjaye> it says putty emulates Meta-key by doing ESCAPE key
[02:52:42] <johnjaye> in which case it should be working for me
[02:53:29] <johnjaye> i did (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "M-<right>") ...)

[02:53:43] <johnjaye> should I try something like ESC <right> maybe?
[02:53:44] <Catie> I needed to set 'metaSendsEscape' in xterm for it to work properly with Emacs, so I figure maybe there's a similar setting for PuTTY
[02:54:01] <johnjaye> you had to do that in xterm?
[02:54:47] <Catie> Yeah, with it unset meta prints a bunch of characters I have no interest in using

[04:37:14] <wgreenhouse> earthToAdam: "return focus to the way it was" meaning the WM window that previously had focus?
[04:37:26] <wgreenhouse> (whether or not this was an emacs frame)

[04:38:44] <earthToAdam> wgreehouse. Exactly. So before the floating org-capture frame pops up, my browser has focus. When the popup window closes, I want to return focus to the browser

[04:42:24] <grym> wgreenhouse: off topic, but i'm wandering up your neck of the woods next week; i'll have two releases at work this week and that means i can go skiing, right
[04:42:53] <earthToAdam> AppleScript could do it. I launch emacsclient from AS to get selected text to pipe into Emacs anyway
[04:43:12] <earthToAdam> I wonder if I can capture the state of the other Emacs windows in advance and then just return them to where they were before?
[04:43:15] <wgreenhouse> grym: hopefully this neck of the woods has something to offer you then other than breakneck ice
[04:43:33] <grym> wgreenhouse: that'd be nice!  well, probably sloggy wet slop
[04:43:47] <wgreenhouse> earthToAdam: sounds plausible, if there's some sort of window state undo/redo stack you can access from applescript
[04:44:00] <wgreenhouse> (which idk, but sounds like could be a thing)
[04:45:42] <earthToAdam> "activate application \"Safari\"" works. Only thing is if I run this after the popup closes, the other emacs frames momentarily become frontmont...

[07:50:53] <bpalmer> suss: require does no harm. The first thing it does is check if the feature is provided and if so, stops.
[07:52:14] <suss> bpalmer then should i put (require 'socks) before (require 'package) to get download package over socks ?
[07:53:59] <bpalmer> suss: (require 'package) doesn't try to download the package at all.
[07:54:44] <bpalmer> (require 'package) is going to do, roughly,  (unless (featurep 'package) (load (symbol-name 'package)) (assert (featurep 'package)))

[11:13:47] <edgar-rft> "open files" probably means everything that the OS sees as "file", e.g. pipelines to external processes and such things
[11:13:53] <dorf> Hi, I've recently updated my python setup to use lsp an pyright backend - it works great. But it seems to have broken my imenu, wich I use often to jump between functions. It lists the functions, but when i select a function it gives me a sublist with variables in the function that i need to select to jump to that variable inside the function instead of the definition. Googling told me it was semantics causing this, but how do i go
[11:13:53] <dorf> about disabling that?
[11:14:32] <adgtl> @edgar-rft it happens only in Emacs, not in VS Code etc.. so looking for a fix

[17:23:30] <roxlu> hi, when I want to create a new file, I often use `C-f`, '<filename>` and hit `enter`. But when a file with a similar name exists; e.g. I want to create "Product.c" but "ProductList.c" already exists I can't create a file like this as it opens "ProductsList.c". How can I still create the file "Products.c" ?

[17:26:42] <roxlu> thanks pspiagicw, hmm I'm using ivy, but bound `C-x C-f` to `counsel-find-file` (sorry above should have been C-x C-f). Using up arrow doesn't seem to have any effect.
[17:27:55] <pspiagicw> @roxlu By up arrow I meant select the input area. It can be acheived using C-k if using Evil.

[23:50:40] <hodapp> judybot: The second to last man on Earth sat alone in a room. He suddenly shouted: who
[23:50:41] <judybot> hodapp: stole the cookies? The room where the man was was painted all blue and sported a grey airplane with a red strip running across it. On the strip. It was written in tribute to the person who traveled the world at lightning speed, often tired, always taking snapshots as he went through, took notes on history on his way to patent.
