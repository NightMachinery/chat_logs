[00:29:01] <GeDaMo> Yes
[00:29:41] <GeDaMo> The way Forth works is it looks up each token in the dictionary, if it finds it, it executes the attached code; if not, it tries to parse it as a number and pushes it to the stack
[00:30:23] <user51> does finding it implies dropping the token?
[00:30:45] <GeDaMo> It's parsing its way through the input
[00:31:06] <user51> oh, so you mean it would see + and immedietly exectue it

[03:16:59] <InPhase> I learned 6502 first, which made x86 pretty easy, which made mips super easy.  They're all sort of sampling from the same set of mindsets in that generation of assembly languages.

[03:18:52] <InPhase> Voidwarper: There are some notable differences in the modern x86-64 extensions as all those vector operations and such kick in.  Each operation gets a lot more complex in what it actually does, and there are a lot more of them.
[03:19:08] <Voidwarper> Would I gain anything more by also learning a cisc architecture assembly?

[03:20:37] <InPhase> Voidwarper: The "risc" and "cisc" divisions are kind of arbitrary.  6502 was considered cisc in its prime, but is much simpler than some things considered risc now.  So...  it's somewhat meaningless to ask.  :)

[03:22:15] <InPhase> Mips is a popular assembly language used for teaching because it's fairly simple and has a lot of simulators.  But then you know an assembly language that's mostly useless.
[03:23:02] <InPhase> Learning old-school x86 might be more interesting because at least that sets you up with the mindset to pick up modern x86-64, which is nearly everything you'll encounter.
[03:23:34] <InPhase> Or you could just try to learn x86-64 from a good book, if you're not easily daunted.  I'm sure there are books that introduce it gradually out there somewhere.

[07:09:45] <Square> a bit off topic, but it seems things doesnt come with replacable batteries these days? With all the development around batteries you expect those AA batteries would have been replaced by something that could be recharged for years.
[07:10:12] <[itchyjunk]> different chemicals altogether
[07:10:21] <[itchyjunk]> i don't see why they would put rechargable battries
[07:10:39] <[itchyjunk]> they give you 2 to start off with at best and you're supposed to have your own rechargable ones you use

[07:14:47] <arahael> Sauvin: Because it's difficult to get them in, unless they're inside an appliance like a laptop or phone.
[07:14:55] <[itchyjunk]> its in usa too for air transport i think

[07:16:22] <arahael> Sauvin: Oh, we have batteries, but transporting LiIon batteries is complex.  I imagine we have a bunch of boatloads or something, but eg, replacing the lead-acid battery in my car recently cost me about $370.
[07:16:35] <oldlaptop> The less-cynical version is mostly twofold: If you're talking about things like cellphones, people want the device to be as thin and sleek as possible, which militates against a bunch of other things, including replaceable battery packs.
[07:16:57] <oldlaptop> The other problem is that soft-cased li-ion polymer cells are *not* something you want random members of the public handling.
[07:17:03] <[itchyjunk]> well, phones come with rechargable battries
[07:17:12] <Square> im actually talking about bike head lights https://www.bumm.de/en/products/akku-scheinwerfer.html <-- none of those come with replacable batteries and cost up to $150

[07:18:14] *** Joins: Fault (~Fault@152.70.112.168)
[07:18:18] <[itchyjunk]> a) they are expensive b) it's more complicated to source in bulk c) rechargables have their own standards based on the country you're shipping to
[07:18:37] <[itchyjunk]> d) indluding a recharges is added cost and logistics
[07:19:11] <oldlaptop> Some of those kinds of devices may have cylindrical 18650 li-ion cells in them, which are a *little* safer to handle, but you still don't really want Joe Q. Public handling them, as we are reminded every time someone's pants catch fire because he thought it would be okay to drop one in his pocket.
[07:19:12] <[itchyjunk]> the end user should be the one purchasing rechargable battries. not the product shipping you with one.
[07:19:26] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: The end-user here can't purchase them, except for AA's.
[07:19:32] <[itchyjunk]> if you have some duracell recharger, you're not supposed to use it to recharge off the shelf rechargables
[07:19:46] <pikapika> arahael, they have been trying really hard to make batteries tough to purchase/charge
[07:19:47] <[itchyjunk]> if they include some and you charge them in your duracell, they get in trouble
[07:19:56] <pikapika> Most phones are sealed cases these days for example
[07:19:59] <[itchyjunk]> because they didn't include a specification meeting charger.
[07:20:13] <oldlaptop> (The two likely culprits for that kind of thing actually are fancy high-power lights and "e-cigarrette" type devices - obviously the cigarrette-sized ones don't have room for 18650s, though)
[07:20:20] <Square> oldlaptop, so you are saying most of them are inherently ticking bombs?  
[07:20:52] <oldlaptop> No, I'm saying having random members of the public handling 18650s all the time is going to result in more pants fires than would be ideal.
[07:20:52] <[itchyjunk]> not all rechargable battries are li ion family of battries
[07:20:55] <oldlaptop> Among other problems.
[07:21:05] <arahael> pikapika: Who is "they"?  But yes, they are very tough to purchase separately.
[07:21:14] <[itchyjunk]> NiCd is common for AA's
[07:21:18] <pikapika> arahael, phone and laptop manufacturers
[07:21:26] <oldlaptop> That is true - but we're (apparently) talking about why the cutting edge of electrochemical technology isn't in "AAs"
[07:21:28] <_rtypo> Square: my bike lights all came with alkaline batteries, I simply replaced them with NiMH of my choice, done. + I have a decent, cheap charger with 4 slots (Liitokala Lii-500)
[07:21:34] <arahael> pikapika: Ah, yes.  And they've been succeeding.
[07:21:49] <oldlaptop> NiCd is actually getting *uncommon* now, precisely because it's very far from the cutting edge
[07:21:53] <pikapika> Something funny I have noticed is that most failures I have seen have been at connectors/cables and not the core circuitry itself
[07:21:57] <pikapika> Its probably deliberate too
[07:22:15] <Square> _rtypo, cool!
[07:22:20] <oldlaptop> NiMH is still widely available in AA-type form factors, but is never going to completely displace alkaline cells simply because the voltage is different

[07:23:42] <oldlaptop> _rtypo: Indeed, I use AA NiMH cells for a lot. They're nice - and much more forgiving than most li-ion-family things
[07:23:57] <[itchyjunk]> NiCd is still pretty popular.

[07:24:34] <oldlaptop> Lithium-iron-phosphate is an interesting tradeoff, I wonder if that will begin moving in to some of the remaining applications for ordinary 18650s and so forth.
[07:25:01] <oldlaptop> [itchyjunk]: No, if you walk into Wal-Mart or something and buy rechargeable AAs from Duracell or some other name brand, they're almost certainly going to be NiMH.
[07:26:03] <flakland> you can get lead acid there too
[07:26:10] <_rtypo> NiCd are restricted in the EU because of the environmental issues with cadmium

[07:26:38] <oldlaptop> NiCd does not have very many redeeming attributes in comparison to NiMH - maaaaaybe a bit better tolerance for gibberingly insane current draw? but most devices that take AA-type cells are going to be engineered with alkaline AAs in mind, which are *much* worse in that regard than more or less any rechargeable chemistry.

[16:33:38] <mrig> The down side to making all UI's the same, it is leaning on the very same effect that makes UI's similar.
[16:33:40] <user51> is that close to how c's switch statement works?

[16:35:03] <jamea> thanks
[16:35:25] <vdamewood> user51: Nope. Switch statements are usually implemented with a jmp table.
[16:37:13] <user51> vdamewood: could forth's dictionary lookup also be a jmp table?

[16:37:49] <GeDaMo> Traditionally, Forth's dictionary is a linked list but it could be a hash table or similar
[16:37:50] <vdamewood> Usually dictionaries are implemented with hash tables or tree lookups.

[18:39:45] <mrig> tomathy but coincidentally I am kind of pondering similar right now and the conclusion that I'm coming to is that I have to get over the fear of hacking back into my code to re-factor it continually, and to do this I need to get away from code completion and linters.

[22:01:06] <derjanni> The software engineers blaming the HW guys, sure. They could've just said: my program doesn't have sufficient input parameters to activate MCAS, I am not going to build this.
[22:01:15] <apotheon> (setting us up, et cetera)
[22:01:16] <derjanni> apotheon: true, agreed.
[22:01:51] <apotheon> I had a boss once whose instruction to me on a project was effectively to solve the caching problem.

[22:02:15] <apotheon> Don't look at me.  I am not writing code that kills people.
[22:02:22] <CalimeroTeknik> derjanni, actually when there are two sensors, the MCAS could disable itself immediately if they don't agree, making this a software design defect?
[22:02:46] <nisstyre> > In November 2017, after several months of MAX deliveries, Boeing discovered that the AoA Disagree message, which is indicative of potential sensor mismatch on the primary flight display,[111] was unintentionally disabled

[22:17:47] <derjanni> It is the responsibility of all software engineers to ensure ethical standards and human rights are considered in their programs.

[22:18:47] <apotheon> Has anyone mentioned that software engineering ethics is already a solved problem?  It's simple: writing a nuke_baghdad() method is unethical; it should be nuke_city() and you pass baghdad as an argument.

[22:31:00] <oldlaptop> It's hilarious: someone marches in here babbling about how UNQUALIFIED NITWITS who SHOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT SOFTWARE are LITERALLY KILLING PEOPLE, as Uncle Bob warned us all! And then talks as if PHP was some kind of carefully precision-engineered product crafted by SUPER QUALIFIED ENGINEERS, instead of (fundamentally) an accretion of hacks on top of hacks which the php people are still trying to fix.
[22:31:24] <derjanni> PHP is a baby language.

[22:33:41] <derjanni> Personal Home Page aka PHP was a hack from Day 1.
[22:33:42] <CalimeroTeknik> okay but nothing quite matches PHP on the bogosity level
[22:33:56] <CalimeroTeknik> in the realm of actually used hacks
[22:34:02] <derjanni> Well JavaScript was hacked together, getting close to PHP.
[22:34:08] <CalimeroTeknik> even COBOL is more sane than PHP
[22:34:11] <derjanni> No

[22:34:40] <oldlaptop> jeaye: php is unusual in the complete absense of any kind of coherent design
[22:34:43] <wildo> I'm afraid in here to say PHP and Laravel == comfy!
[22:34:46] <apotheon> I think that once there are four existing implementations of the same function with different names, some of them including descriptors in the function name like "real" or "actual", and three of the four are considered "bad" but not deprecated, it's getting kinda impossible to reasonably call it a "nice" language.
[22:34:57] <apotheon> Get back to me when that problem gets fixed.
[22:35:01] <CalimeroTeknik> derjanni, seriously though, read that one https://web.archive.org/web/20120412194929/http://use.perl.org:80/use.perl.org/_Aristotle/journal/33448.html

[22:35:28] <oldlaptop> most of the time the hacks are piled up on top of some actual *design* of some kind, and often you can still mostly see the outline of that design under the snow
[22:35:31] <jeaye> oldlaptop: JS is in a similar boat, in a lot of ways.
[22:35:34] <derjanni> Saying PHP and Laravel in one sentence is like saying: "I am on drugs and have lost control of my life".
[22:35:37] <oldlaptop> there is nothing under php's snow

[22:35:46] <apotheon> 19:03 < oldlaptop> apotheon: I take issue with using "designed" in any sort of connection with php
[22:35:57] <apotheon> That was my original objection, too, but it's still a nice quote.

[22:36:13] <apotheon> I hate that about computers, too.
[22:36:15] <oldlaptop> and there is with JS - it may have been designed in about a week, but there was a deliberate design process involved and something of that vision still shows
[22:36:25] <apotheon> at least the *way* they're accretions of hacks
[22:36:43] <oldlaptop> not only that, but some of the more common criticisms (e.g. prototypal inheritance) are actually disagreements with those design ideas
[22:36:47] <wildo> sorry, derjanni but that's how I put food in the table

[22:40:15] <apotheon> derjanni: I disagree that a two-week hack-together with a basic design premise is its problem.  Many things can be reworked into something beautiful from such a start.  The committee destroyed any potential for that, though.
[22:40:19] <CalimeroTeknik> derjanni, the correct answer was "use Rust instead"

[23:35:32] <apotheon> There's no good reason to use Oracle, as far as I've been able to determine, and this comes from someone whose spouse is an Oracle DBA and developer.

[23:44:45] <apotheon> I had a supervisor at another job who made me jump through process hoops over the course of months to try to get a change into an internal tool.  It was a fix for the tool's failure to produce data under circumstances where Unicode appeared in the source data.
[23:44:46] <derjanni> The worst Mr. Boss can do is to fire you. And if that happens, you just get a new job. If you can't find one, you are stupid and just DM me, I'll get you one.
[23:45:30] <apotheon> That supervisor eventually told me to stop trying to get it in.  She just wanted me to give up, and used passive-aggressive application of bureaucracy to try to exhaust me, rather than just tell me that the fix was unwanted because she personally didn't use that tool and didn't like it.
