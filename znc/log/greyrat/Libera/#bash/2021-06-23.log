[16:44:24] *** riff_IRC is now known as riff-IRC
[16:45:11] <cousteau> So the argument MUST contain a backslash.  If you write ``printf \n`` the shell will remove that \ and only pass a single n to printf 
[16:45:38] <geirha> ZAJDAN: like this: http://ix.io/3qRZ
[16:45:59] <geirha> gah, 3>> should be changed to >>
[16:46:27] <cousteau> But if you do ``printf '\n'`` the single quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the backslash so printf actually sees a two character sequence «\n»

[19:17:30] <pyzozord> Hi, trying to find the nicest way to do the following: override cd and traverse all directories that make up the path passed to the cd to check if a specific file exists there
[19:18:09] <pyzozord> I was thinking some kind of string split by '/' character but I think this will not work in a naive way, since probably directories can have \/ in their names
[19:18:39] <mknod> no they can't
[19:18:51] *** xiaomiao is now known as AmazingPudding
[19:19:32] <pyzozord> so maybe to rephrase: how can I get array with all paths to all directories that make up a path. So I want "/foo/bar/bazz" to be converted to ["/", "/foo", "/foo/bar", "/foo/bar/bazz"]
[19:19:37] <mknod> but this doesn't make pathname parsing an easy task regardless
[19:19:40] <Soliton> i would assume you want to check PWD after changing dir and not the argument to cd.

[19:21:53] *** Joins: JesseW_not_logge (~JesseW_no@c-24-218-81-120.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[19:22:06] <pyzozord> I think I could use realpath instead of pwd in case I want to check the path before changing the directory
[19:24:10] <Soliton> the important part is to check the actual dir and not the argument to cd.
[19:24:28] <pyzozord> yep yep, I think pwd/realpath will solve that issue
[19:24:32] <Soliton> at least i assume you don't just want to check foo when cd foo is called.
[19:24:44] <pyzozord> my big problem is figuring out how to split them to that kind of array I mentioned
[19:24:54] <pyzozord> so that i can "visit" each parent dir
[19:25:13] <pyzozord> by "visit" I mean "check if it contains specific file"
[19:25:35] <Soliton> IFS=/ read -ra paths <<< "$PWD"
[19:26:31] <mknod> they don't want to split, they want to expand each subpaths
[19:26:37] <pyzozord> oh ok so I do can split by /
[19:27:23] <Soliton> you can also do a PE in a loop.

[20:18:10] <pyzozord> thanks! I think that's a good plan B
[20:18:28] <pyzozord> I was hoping I could get away without looping throught the list second time though
[20:18:49] <pyzozord> I mean having the original loop build like this / /foo /foo/bar
[20:19:08] <pyzozord> so that way I don't need to build any lists at all, I can just process paths in the curent iteration of the loop

[21:39:28] <pyzozord> OK I have this thing pretty much working now. Last thing I need is for those paths to be in the correct order which is from / to /foo/bar/bazz, right now the order is random https://ideone.com/LDt2fz
[21:39:54] <pyzozord> I think in line 22 where I itrate over hashmap values it choses the random order of the values
[21:41:04] <pyzozord> I essentially just want to during CD check every directory from pwd to the destination if it contains a .bashrc in that order
[21:41:10] <omegatron> wwalker: you mean like in  CDPATH= some command ..  ?
[21:42:13] <wwalker> I realize now that in those cases that it is annoying I can go back a word and insert ./ and go to the end and hit tab again.  I'll just define something in .inputrc to do that
[21:42:22] <pyzozord> so if I am in /foo and i do CD ./bar/buzz/fuzz it will check if /foo/bar has .bashrc then /foo/bar/buzz has .bashrc and last ./foo/bar/buzz/fuzz has .bashrc

[22:32:35] <twkm> you don't use the return value, though you possibly should.  25 is no biggie.  24 not sure why you ended the quoted plain text before the variable expansion.  not sure why you quote the expansion inside of [[.  random trailing ;'s that aren't needed, but also don't hurt.

[22:34:50] <pyzozord> i wanted to remove all not needed ; - force of habit made me left few in accidentally
[22:35:01] <twkm> similarly it doesn't handle cd's options, though i suspect you don't use them so don't much care if your function does.

[22:40:09] <twkm> but for -f the quotes aren't significant.  for == and =~ quoting the rhs is significant, it disables pattern/regex matching.
