[03:37:12] <ThePendulum> which appointment was this?
[03:37:56] <skye0> technically yesterday, to see a GP for progress on medication. wanted to go private but they recommended against it
[03:38:36] <skye0> yes, i commend the NHS for their work but because of pandemic denialism threatening to destroy the NHS and transphobia in the UK as manifested by its long waiting lists, i'm thinking of transitioning privately
[03:38:37] <skye0> or doing DIY
[03:39:50] <sarnold> "DIY" I get impressions of just going to the hardware store and buying some tools and ... 
[03:41:10] <joepie91> sarnold: more like https://hrt.cafe/
[03:41:57] <sarnold> joepie91: oh wow
[03:43:33] <joepie91> sarnold: I mean, with the transphobic policymaking in many countries, you gotta make do I suppose
[03:43:41] <joepie91> so it's not surprising that sites like this exist
[03:43:53] <sarnold> I'm just surprised there's so many choices
[03:43:58] <joepie91> heh
[03:44:08] <sarnold> and from countries where I certainly wouldn't have expected them
[03:44:25] <sarnold> though again, maybe the transphobic policymaking has something to do with that..

[04:17:54] <unfinity> sarnold you befriended a duck in 4.006 seconds! You have made friends with 117 ducks in #datahoarder.
[04:18:02] <sarnold> YAY I GOTTA DUCKY
[04:18:21] <skye0> i'm on
[04:18:31] <skye0> just bored, playing games to try and have some semblance of fun
[04:19:49] <rawktucc> https://tilde.team/~rawktucc/100tb-travel.html I really need opinions on this. I'm considering the remote server but stressed
[04:20:18] <rawktucc> Now no, most of the data does not need to be accessed hot, it can be cold stored. but see option C
[04:26:06] <sarnold> zounds that scaleway cost..
[04:27:16] <joepie91> rawktucc: if you're concerned about random service terminations, definitely stay the hell away from scaleway :)
[04:27:22] <rawktucc> 0_0
[04:27:32] <joepie91> it's online.net, infamous for having a godawful billing department
[04:27:37] <joepie91> and general administration
[04:27:41] <rawktucc> they billed me fine so far
[04:27:47] <joepie91> if for any reason anything goes wrong, you have a Problem
[04:27:53] <joepie91> and it will be a nightmare to get it fixed before your server goes poof
[04:28:12] <rawktucc> im using backblae b2 and scaleway c14 for just truly critical do-not-want-to-lose data
[04:28:25] <rawktucc> but I guess i will not be using it for the rest of my casual data
[04:28:34] <rawktucc> which server is going poof joepie91 ? the hetzner?
[04:28:45] <joepie91> rawktucc: scaleway
[04:28:51] <joepie91> s/server/storage/, whatever
[04:29:05] <rawktucc> oh ok
[04:29:11] <rawktucc> so then option c is no good for lots of data
[04:29:13] <joepie91> point being that it's not unheard of for billing or other administrative issues to result in service terminations because online.net insisted that the problem was not on their end
[04:29:40] <joepie91> yeah I def wouldn't trust them with a service that needs to remain up
[04:30:02] <rawktucc> no no it's not data or a service that needs to be active
[04:30:07] <rawktucc> i just don't really want to lose any of this data 
[04:30:14] <rawktucc> and well, Option B is debatable if a good idea
[04:30:23] <joepie91> up == not terminated or deleted, in this case :p
[04:30:24] <rawktucc> the entire local server should be moved to ZFS anyway
[04:30:25] <rawktucc> oh
[04:32:48] *** Joins: qaph (~weechat@user/qaph)
[04:33:40] <rawktucc> so... what do you think joepie91 
[04:34:20] <joepie91> afaik the problems with hetzner are mainly suspensions due to publicly hosted content
[04:34:30] <joepie91> and historically DDoS but I think that's no longer an issue
[04:34:37] <joepie91> so for private storage that does seem like a reasonable option to me
[04:34:54] <rawktucc> that is the intention

[04:35:20] <rawktucc> i also worry maybe if i were to setup a jellyfin watch party for myself and a friend when I'm abroad
[04:35:23] <rawktucc> if they'd smack me for that
[04:35:30] <rawktucc> but even still, they would need a login (friend)
[04:36:05] <rawktucc> is anyone here doing something with one of those hetzner boxes?
[04:36:23] * joepie91 has some stuff running at hetzner
[04:36:32] <joepie91> not super public though
[04:36:40] <rawktucc> basically the idea of renting that machine is two fold. one, remove the stress and anxiety factor of an at home volatile machine. two, enough space for all this dumb garbage I'm holding, even if I'm not using it actively
[04:36:54] <rawktucc> joepie91, like copyright infringeing stuff?
[04:37:31] <joepie91> nop
[04:37:47] <rawktucc> well that's anxiety
[04:41:20] <skye0> the shit i want to hoard the US would want to do me in exactly for the whole copyrights stuff. my knowledge in networking though is next to none though and i've never really been enthused by i
[04:41:44] <cirdan> Worst case thereâ€™s always rclone and encrypted mounts...
[04:41:54] <rawktucc> cirdan well that's the plan mainly
[04:42:01] <rawktucc> zfs as a top layer but rclone and encrypted under
[04:42:10] <rawktucc> even that I still think is too risky, what if they're looking at my system
[04:42:24] <rawktucc> but maybe that's just extreme paranoia
[04:42:44] <skye0> veracrypt is decent but i don't think it's completely foolproof even if used on hard drives
[04:42:57] <rawktucc> No I would just use rclone crypt
[04:43:03] <rawktucc> I already do but 
[04:43:12] <skye0> suspicions could still be aroused over old and unused files in the visible partition(s) and you're stuck with one or two file systems
[04:43:24] <rawktucc> what do you mean skye0 ?
[04:43:36] <skye0> veracrypt allows for hidden partitions
[04:44:33] <skye0> which can't be accessed except for a specific separate password for that partition and one or two options enabled
[04:44:49] <rawktucc> that's just zfs 
[04:45:35] <skye0> interesting. once i get a new HDD i will have to consider formatting it under ZFS but i haven't used it before
[04:45:38] <rawktucc> a zfs share I mean
[04:45:51] <rawktucc> they'd see the metadata though so actually veracrypt works better
[04:45:53] <skye0> hm. i'll ask later sooner to the time i get that HDD
[04:45:58] <skye0> ah
[04:46:33] <skye0> veracrypt is quite user friendly too at least because of the GUI apps and the whole wizard
[04:47:11] <skye0> i still worry about accidental data loss in any case because of erroneous configuration for anything
[05:24:50] <KevinCarbonara> If all you're hiding is copyrighted files, you don't need anything crazy. Veracrypt would be fine

[05:31:12] <Selavi> true. xor also keeps the information

[20:36:39] <skye0> OK, so i'm wondering how to automate the following processes without resorting to using macros:
[20:36:39] <skye0> - Exporting Firefox and MS Edge bookmarks to HTML or some other suitably parseable format - I understand MS Edge and other Chromium based browsers store a JSON file under `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\[Chromium-based browser subdirectories]\User Data\Default\Bookmarks `
[20:37:51] <skye0> - Exporting Firefox databases (specifically in `AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profile]\places.sqlite` without the need for GUI programs such as DB Browser for SQLite
[20:38:58] <skye0> - Exporting emails saved by Mozilla Thunderbird or some other desktop email client (I currently have to use the ImportExportTools extension for Thunderbird to export emails to HTML, which I can't really automate).
[20:39:43] <skye0> I'm aware of some mail programs on Linux that use the .mbox extension though. They require email clients but thankfully a lot of email clients that support them are open source
[20:40:18] <skye0> The first step I might be able to achieve programmatically with Python but I'm wondering where bookmarks are stored in Firefox. I'll need to find this out soon.

[22:33:39] <blaub> hiii
[22:33:48] <blaub> just started hoarding
[22:33:51] <blaub> pls don't laugh at me
[22:33:56] <blaub> 40 gig here...
[22:34:57] <rawktucc> you're well onm your way
[22:35:21] <rawktucc> skye0, export of ff bookmarks might be doable using the automatic bookmarks backup ff makes
[22:35:22] <blaub> i want to hard music but don't know how people got "500gb of music"
[22:35:33] <rawktucc> blaub, buying CDs and digital media
[22:35:34] <blaub> not that i'm looking to pirate it, but you know, youtube is public
[22:35:35] <rawktucc> also piracy
[22:35:56] <rawktucc> blaub: you can use yt-dlp but youtube audio quality is not lossless
[22:36:00] <rawktucc> so that's also how you can easily reach 500GB
[22:36:02] <blaub> the real issue is, i've no music taste or don't have "fav bands" like many people do or even "fav genres"
[22:36:04] <rawktucc> i have about 4TB right now I think
[22:36:09] <blaub> O_o
[22:36:11] <blaub> holy
[22:36:17] <unfinity> ãƒ»ã‚œ â€‹ ã‚œãƒ»ã€‚ã€‚ãƒ»ã‚œã‚œ\â€‹_0< qâ€‹uack!
[22:36:19] <blaub> even the time you invested in to get all of it
[22:36:20] <blaub> ,bef
[22:36:20] <unfinity> blaub you befriended a duck in 2.903 seconds! You have made friends with 1 duck in #datahoarder.
[22:36:22] <rawktucc> last.fm, you can plug your current fave bands in there and see what the site recommends
[22:36:23] <skye0> rawktucc ideally i'd like to do it all without opening the browser, entirely through the command line. unfortunately i found out mozilla's files use jsonlz4. which require opening the browser
[22:36:30] *** Joins: Sgeo (~Sgeo@user/sgeo)
[22:36:31] <rawktucc> yeah skye0 I think that's the problem
[22:36:38] <rawktucc> and also the other problem is you can't really run those headless
[22:36:43] <blaub> how to "easily" get so much music?

[22:36:53] <skye0> thankfully i don't use firefox that much these days but i still want to keep all my data up to date if you pardon the pun
[22:36:59] <blaub> yeah but i mean if i want to go the youtube-dl way
[22:37:02] <rawktucc> bandcamp, from artist stores 
[22:37:03] <blaub> what to download, where to start
[22:37:06] <skye0> blaub dick around on YT for a number of years for shit you like
[22:37:09] <rawktucc> use yt-dlp
[22:37:10] <rawktucc> https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/
[22:37:15] <blaub> 500gb means you basically have every song on the planet
[22:37:22] <skye0> ,get https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=C-Q_J6VhgH8&t=522
[22:37:23] <unfinity> Piped
[22:37:26] <rawktucc> haha if it was mp3 at very low quality 
[22:37:29] <rawktucc> but not even
[22:37:31] <skye0> here's a starting point, but buy his tracks if you want to support him
[22:37:35] <skye0> i just gotta be careful with my own money
[22:37:44] <blaub> skye0: the problem is, i dont know what i like so i thought just download all of it and delete the stuff i dont like :)
[22:37:44] <skye0> also hoard twitch vods
[22:37:50] <skye0> easy way to fill your hard drive
[22:37:54] <blaub> the only thing i know i like is: to browse my music collection with cmus
[22:37:57] <rawktucc> blaub, last.fm I assure you is a good choice
[22:38:06] <blaub> but last.fm is old :/
[22:38:06] <rawktucc> or give us an artist you like
[22:38:10] <blaub> nickelback
[22:38:10] <rawktucc> old != bad
[22:38:31] <skye0> twitch vods will also help you fill up hard drive space
[22:38:43] <rawktucc> https://www.last.fm/music/Nickelback/+similar
[22:38:53] <skye0> also, if you are able to, chaturbate and only fans videos i guess? may give you at least something if finding content you want is a struggle
[22:38:59] <blaub> oh so i dont need to have an account?
[22:39:04] <rawktucc> yikes I would not recommend that skye0 
[22:39:10] <blaub> i think thats the reason people usually stick to spotify, so they're able to find new music
[22:39:23] <skye0> yeah, support your local sex workers when you can
[22:39:24] <rawktucc> well i have mixed feelings on algorithmic music suggestions but

[22:39:37] <rawktucc> blaub you don't need an account to use last.fm, look at that link I sent
[22:39:38] <Hydragyrum> I usually use pianobar (pandora) for that
[22:39:40] <skye0> i just want to hoard from anywhere DRM-free so i can keep what i want
[22:39:45] <rawktucc> you can search for an artist and look at the similar artist page
[22:39:54] <skye0> because even with $10/month i can't keep the music i love on spotify
[22:39:56] <rawktucc> if you want last.fm to track your music you listen to with cmus then yes
[22:39:59] <blaub> still, it requires effort to hoard music
[22:39:59] <rawktucc> skye0, yes exactly
[22:40:01] <skye0> it's like a user on demand radio though
[22:40:05] <rawktucc> yes blaub all of this requires effort
[22:40:12] <rawktucc> so that's why people use spotify hahahaha :D
[22:40:19] <blaub> look it up on youtube, find the exact stuff, download it. even if it is not that much effort
[22:40:51] <blaub> i still dont think people got to 500gb doing it all manually, i guess they've been to an "event" and downloaded it from each other
[22:40:57] <blaub> like an rsync circle
[22:41:08] <skye0> or maybe program it to look up random shit for you to download it

[22:42:32] <skye0> had the title GWEN AND KEVIN TRIBUTE
[22:42:46] <skye0> it was in the days when Ben 10: Alien Force was out, back in 2008
[22:42:55] <skye0> was on youtube but got deleted either by the user or copyright
[22:42:59] <rawktucc> oh an AMV
[22:44:00] <skye0> yup
[22:44:12] <skye0> but "AMV" to me seems like it's limited to just anime
