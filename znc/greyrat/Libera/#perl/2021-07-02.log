[04:48:49] <simcop2387> genio: how goes the SP stuff? I'm going to try to get w11 going on my raspberry pi 4 to see if i can get mingw-llvm going and build a SP for arm64 windows on it.
[04:50:05] <genio> my win10 partition is crazy since the update to 21h1. about to rebuild that partition with a fresh install and remove all of the Dell-ware to see if it acts happier. I was in the process of building PS scripts to automate some setup stuff but just moving the mouse caused the machine to bog down. My linux partition is happy, so it's not hardware
[04:51:26] <simcop2387> weird
[04:51:53] <simcop2387> i saw there was someone in #perl-help the other day asking about SP for arm64 windows, so there's actually some weird kind of call for it now.

[09:50:59] <mst> Bossi: remember, perl's 'threads.pm' is the win32 fork emulation, no more, no less, so, yeah, sorry, that's a bug worth reporting ... but also I can't say I'm surprised
[09:52:07] <Bossi> good morning mst, yes i read that in an article during the night :/ and currently it is in a running state, but the more threads the slower it gets
[09:53:43] <Bossi> and i almost share nothing between the threads, even i disabled the use of the shared counter, which should coordinate the order of the output
[09:54:10] <Adura> Is MCE a suitable replacement?
[09:55:51] <Bossi> i need to find the point where i testet all this, and found it working, increased performance by increased thread count

[18:13:16] <zgu> if i could go back in time and change one thing i would add a real first-class polygon datatype to the openstreetmap schema when they first designed the database
[18:13:25] <simcop2387> I think one of the first things I need to do though is create and setup a new openvpn profile that can be bridged instead of just routed.  I have a few interesting desires for that.
[18:13:37] <zgu> and if that didn't work i'd try again all of the 3 or 4 times when they redesigned it
[18:13:37] <ology> simcop2387: ok
[18:17:38] <simcop2387> zgu: i think the hardest part of a polygon type for osm is that i don't know how you make a polygon type for non-euclidean spaces.  i'm sure someone knows though but it's not obvious to me how you do it since the edges aren't going to have a single definition of "straight"
[18:18:12] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: oooo rex has libvirt support already, nice
[18:18:28] <simcop2387> and docker too.  both good things and what i'll need/want
[18:19:14] <zgu> oh that's also fun. like projecting between plate caree or eq mercator and any conic projection
[18:20:43] <zgu> but on a more fundamental level, it has 3 different ways to represent polygon/area features, and the one that's used by far the most often is inherently impossible for processing tools to interpret in the general case without knowledge of various tagging conventions (which can change over time)
[18:20:53] <simcop2387> yep, it'd be easy to do the naive of "straight line after projecting the points" but then the lines themselves will move/change depending on the projection, *but* it's not always going to be clear that someone who drew a polygon is going to want the properly curved lines for the surface of the sphere either

[18:28:30] <pflanze> Is there a standard way to derive a typeid or type name from any value? If blessed, the class name, but also for unblessed references, and non-references, hence needing an additional component.
[18:29:26] <simcop2387> not a standard way that i know of but between reftype() and blessed() from Scalar::Util I think you can make something
[18:29:34] <zgu> which is why land surveying traditionally uses coordinate systems that approximate the local area as a plane as best as possible. but you can't make a single worldwide database that way
[18:30:24] <simcop2387> pflanze: basically i think the tuple (though perl doesn't have that as a type) of reftype() and blessed() should be able to uniquely identify the type of a scalar, assuming no tie() shenanigoats

[18:33:39] <pflanze> Everything is a string in Perl except some strings are less so than others :)

[19:41:26] <haarg> but why do you need to check this in the first place?
[19:42:47] <Grinnz> for context, haarg has messed with this a lot for json encoders
[19:42:51] <pflanze> I'm interested in it to do nice generic sorting.
[19:43:05] <haarg> absolutely do not do that
[19:43:57] <Botje-> I'm reminded of that V8 engineer who sped up sort by inlining a comparator somewhere.
[19:44:07] <Botje-> in a string eval. ew.
[19:44:09] <pflanze> For showing items contained in an unsorted data structure in a sorted way, via my `show` function.
[19:45:10] <thrig> why does V8 juice need an engineer
[19:45:21] <Grinnz> what you're trying for is consistent debug output of a custom data structure which can contain arbitrary unsorted scalars?
[19:45:44] <pflanze> Yes
[19:46:09] <pflanze> (Also, speaking of what I'm doing right now, typename, I use this for keying in caches. I tend to think that it won't hurt, and might help there.)
[19:46:16] <Grinnz> would sorting by refaddr be sufficient?
[19:46:46] <Grinnz> that would change each run of course
[19:47:31] <pflanze> That's not ideal, also not useful for humans.
[19:47:39] <Grinnz> the only type a scalar has is how many type flags it has - scalars don't have one type
[19:48:02] <pflanze> I currently just use default sort { }, hence, string sort. And it's not ideal to see numbers sorted alphabetically.

[21:09:00] <leitz> Is there a way to short-circut a command, such that the --help option takes precedence even if it's not the first option in ARGV?
[21:09:34] <pflanze> You can pass coderefs to GetOptions
[21:10:08] <pflanze> i.e. if you pass sub { help } to "--help" then it will run the help handler before finishing option parsing.
[21:10:10] <thrig> help => sub { die "todo" }
[21:10:35] <leitz> I have    "help  => \&usage," in the GetOptions stanza, and "usage" calls exit(); But if a run a command, with --help at the end of the arguments, it still runs the command.
[21:11:13] <pflanze> Do *not* use coderefs for the non-help options?
[21:11:37] <thrig> what does "run a command" mean?
[21:11:45] <pflanze> Or have them only set up the work you want to be done, not running it.
[21:12:17] <leitz> Err...nevermind...imanidiot...
[21:13:14] <leitz> The --help works, my eyes and brain are a bit dodgey, though.

[21:14:12] <pflanze> (embed in a distribution; not necessarily in the same file as Perl code.)
[21:17:19] <haarg> using xs
[21:17:25] <pflanze> Ok

[21:23:53] <Grinnz> random C to make something fast can be an API
[21:24:05] <thrig> all my XS isn't
[21:24:21] <Grinnz> an API in this case is just subroutines

[23:48:21] <v`> that reminded me i think i have that label maker
[23:48:41] <curdlesnoot> ology: the SHELL variable only defines the user's preferred login shell. it's not intended to stipulate the (non-interactive) shell that other programs might call out to. as such, perl correctly doesn't observe it for such purposes.

[23:50:30] <curdlesnoot> basically, if you want something other than some implementation of sh, make a point of executing it.
[23:52:17] <simcop2387> exec "/bin/bash" "bash script here" is the other way
[23:52:25] <curdlesnoot> yeah
[23:52:36] <simcop2387> eval: exec {"bash"} "ls"
[23:52:38] <perlbot> simcop2387: ls: line 1: Biqsip: command not found ls: line 2: Chapar denib qatlh denibya: command not found ls: line 3: Choba: command not found [Exited 127]
[23:52:54] <simcop2387> ok it's probably a little more work than i'm thinking of then
[23:53:05] <simcop2387> oh that's exec not system
[23:53:24] <jpmh> ology: TY  - would have responded earlier - but did not see the post since you did ot include my nick
[23:53:51] <curdlesnoot> simcop2387: well, that example doesn't make sense unless you happen to have a script named ls in the cwd.
[23:53:54] <simcop2387> anyway, perldoc -f exec; can help you more than my fuzzy brane can right now
[23:54:45] <curdlesnoot> I mean, if you have an executable script with a proper shebang, you can just execute it directly to begin with.
[23:55:45] <curdlesnoot> that being said, bash -c ls would have done what I think the example was intended to do. just with an unnecessary shell involved.
[23:56:27] <simcop2387> eval: exec {"bash"} "-c", "ps" 
[23:56:29] <perlbot> simcop2387: /usr/bin/ps: /usr/bin/ps: cannot execute binary file [Exited 126]
[23:56:42] <simcop2387> bah i don't know what i'm doing and i'm almost late for a meeting
[23:56:56] <curdlesnoot> eval: exec("bash", "-c", "ps")
[23:56:57] <perlbot> curdlesnoot: [Died SIGSYS (Illegal Syscall)]
[23:57:00] <curdlesnoot> hmm.
[23:57:04] <curdlesnoot> eval: exec("bash", "-c", "ls")
[23:57:05] <perlbot> curdlesnoot: [Died SIGSYS (Illegal Syscall)]
[23:57:08] <curdlesnoot> oh well.
[23:57:08] <simcop2387> that should be allowed, one moment
[23:57:15] <curdlesnoot> over to you!
[23:57:27] <curdlesnoot> (and please don't let this hold you up)
[23:57:31] <curdlesnoot> it can wait.

[23:58:20] <curdlesnoot> interesting.
[23:58:21] <simcop2387> sounds like something stupid from glibc happening now
[23:58:46] <simcop2387> lets see what error i can mock into it to fool it into just continuing

[23:59:22] <Adura> eval: `bash -c ls`
[23:59:22] <curdlesnoot> ok, so it's definitely bash.
