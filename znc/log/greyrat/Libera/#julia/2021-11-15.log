[15:04:25] <dTal> Uh Tullio.jl is supposedly already faster than OpenBLAS
[15:05:04] <dTal> and it's pretty unfair to say "not much effort" has been put towards symbolic manipulation in Julia
[15:05:41] <dTal> there's Symbolics.jl and Nemo.jl
[15:07:05] <dTal> anyway, solving the 2-language problem isn't about removing foreign libraries from Julia, though that is desirable for other reasons - it's about relieving the user of having to interact with other languages

[19:30:52] <nagefire> I haven't even heard of Tullio.jl, I'll have to look into it
[19:31:22] <nagefire> and symbolics is not comparable to sympy
[19:37:06] <nagefire> dTal Tullio isn't a linear alebgra package

[20:34:24] <dTal> if it's "not a linear algebra package" that makes it awfully impressive that it can multiply matrices faster than OpenBLAS
