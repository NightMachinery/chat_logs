[02:55:09] <AmR> How I can remove : char from string with regex ?
[03:01:18] <OnlineCop> AmR: Use substitution to match the character, and replace it with "nothing"
[03:02:02] <OnlineCop> In some instances, capture the text before/after it, then then replace that before/after text without including the character.
[03:02:18] <OnlineCop> s/(text_before):(text_after)/$1$2/
[03:02:22] <AmR> OnlineCop: Sorry But I don't know regex so much, I only start to know it :(
[03:03:01] <OnlineCop> If you're using regex101, put ':' (the character you want to match) in the pattern at the top, then click SUBSTITUTION on the right.
[03:03:45] <OnlineCop> Since it defaults to "nothing" in the substitution string, that character will be removed.
[03:05:35] <OnlineCop> AmR: https://regex101.com/r/Xpfxiw/1 as an example.
[03:07:35] *** Joins: w0ng (~w0ng@103.1.212.77)
[03:08:41] <AmR> like that " /:/gm " ?
[03:10:32] <OnlineCop> Close, but you need the `s` to make it a substitution: `s/://` (with or without the '/g' at the end).
[03:11:32] <OnlineCop> The `s/` at the beginning means "substitution". Then between the first and second '/' is the pattern to match, and between the second and third '/' is the substitution (nothing between them means to replace with "nothing").
[03:12:01] <OnlineCop> If you put a `g` after the 3rd '/' character, it means that you want to replace all of them (global) instead of just the 1st one you encounter.

[03:20:21] <OnlineCop> Set the pattern to be ":" (a single colon, or whatever you want to use here). `regex_replace()` stores the substitution result into the variable 'result', and at the very end of it, replaces it with "".

[04:13:21] <re101-wasp-57> hi there
[04:14:14] <re101-wasp-57> ı need to learn tag regex but some point flu
[04:15:11] <re101-wasp-57> <(.+?)>([^<>]+)</\\1>
[04:15:35] <OnlineCop> I don't understand.
[04:15:57] <re101-wasp-57> ı need to create html xml tag in java
[04:16:43] *** Joins: adeliktas (~adeliktas@i59F5F955.versanet.de)
[04:16:47] <OnlineCop> If you were given this: <span class="abc">
[04:17:05] <OnlineCop> Then your `\1` capture would be: span class="abc"
[04:17:20] <OnlineCop> So the </\\1> would try to match </span class="abc">
[04:17:53] <OnlineCop> `<([^<>\s]+)[^<>]*>([^<>]+)</\\1>` might work better for you here.
[04:18:23] <re101-wasp-57> [^<>] what does mean wonder
[04:19:36] <OnlineCop> Any character except...
[04:19:47] <OnlineCop> So in this case, [^<>] will not match '<' or '>'
[04:20:21] <re101-wasp-57> okay we lets move step by step
[04:20:39] <OnlineCop> The first portion: `[^<>\s]+` gets captured. That is, not '<' or '>' or whitespace (since <span class...> contains a space after 'span').
[04:21:13] <OnlineCop> Then once it hits a whitespace OR '<' or '>', it stops capturing and then moves to the `[^<>]*`. If it WAS a whitespace, this will consume everything until it reaches the '>'.
[04:21:14] <re101-wasp-57> <.*?> </\\1>  ------>  <abc><abc> provide ?
[04:21:40] <OnlineCop> Do you have an example on regex101.com that you can share?
[04:21:50] <re101-wasp-57> okay w8
[04:26:08] <re101-wasp-57> I am exremely newbie let me tell you ıssue about ıt   I need to create basic that check whether being tag or xml regex
[04:26:26] <re101-wasp-57> <.*?>     [^<>]*      </1.*?>
[04:26:42] <OnlineCop> Do you need to handle nested tags/xml?
[04:26:55] <re101-wasp-57> you know reel tags matches start and end
[04:26:56] <OnlineCop> <span class="outer"><span class="inner">foo</span></span>
[04:27:17] <re101-wasp-57> under the every conditon  working tag rex
[04:27:21] <OnlineCop> Java doesn't support recursion, so wouldn't be good for something like ^ this.
[04:27:22] <re101-wasp-57> nest or single
[04:27:52] <re101-wasp-57> <a><b>newbie</b></a>
[04:28:11] <OnlineCop> You can do something like this with PCRE, but not with Java.
[04:28:22] <re101-wasp-57> whattt
[04:28:25] <OnlineCop> For that, you'll want to use one of Java's DOM/XML parsers.
[04:30:06] <re101-wasp-57>  <(.+?)>   it takes any char.   ([^<>]+)  it just take left and right angle bracket       </\\1> it take captured before exist tag name
[04:30:25] <re101-wasp-57> basicly how  do you do that can you say me
[04:31:36] <re101-wasp-57> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tag-content-extractor/problem
[04:31:46] <re101-wasp-57> problem definition
[04:32:32] <OnlineCop> Ah, a HackerRank challenge. 
[04:33:28] <re101-wasp-57> yeah my man I prefer learn instead of cheating
[04:33:39] <OnlineCop> In that case, `<(.+?)>`...`</\1>` might work, although one of the examples is: <Amee>..</amee> (case difference)
[04:34:51] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/NvuWLD/1 does NOT use case-insensitive. https://regex101.com/r/NvuWLD/2 is the same, but uses /i (case-insensitive).
[04:35:20] <OnlineCop> You could see 'Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE' under Code Generator: https://regex101.com/r/NvuWLD/2/codegen?language=java
[04:37:34] <re101-wasp-57> ı got ı most percent but still a question in my mind still
[04:38:32] <re101-wasp-57> if were make nested tag  <a><b></b></a> something  like that which mecanism execute multiple nested tags
[04:39:30] <OnlineCop> <(.+?)> has the potential to match "any" characters between '<' and '>'. That could include OTHER '<' and '>' characters.
[04:39:58] <OnlineCop> I like to use  <([^<>]+)> so you don't have that possibility.
[04:40:08] <OnlineCop> That is, "any" character except '<' or '>'.
[04:41:38] <OnlineCop> Let's say that you have <a><b></b></a>. You could match <a> and </a> with that, and then ALL of "<b></b>" could match if you used a `.*?` there.
[04:42:25] <OnlineCop> It would not know that anything between <a>..</a> had invalid characters:  <a></b><i><span><b></i></span></a>
[04:42:40] <re101-wasp-57> <([^<>]+)>  it says that I guaarented at least two expression right  <([^<>]*)> ıf I do this eigher work one or multiple right ?
[04:42:48] <OnlineCop> That would match as well with the pattern `<([^<>]+)>(.*?)</\1>`
[04:43:40] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/NvuWLD/3
[04:44:13] <OnlineCop> Look at what happens if you change  <a>  to  <x>
[04:44:25] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/NvuWLD/4
[04:44:59] <OnlineCop> Now, <x> has no </x> on the string, so it tries at the next '<'.
[04:45:46] <re101-wasp-57> https://i.imgur.com/dSumUpr.png missing
[04:45:50] <OnlineCop> That would be </b>, where \1 is "\b" (not just "b"). So then it tries to find a </\1> which would be: <//b> and fails.
[04:46:41] <OnlineCop> Correct, because `(.*?)` allows ANY character to match, including '<' or '>'.
[04:47:06] <OnlineCop> But if you used [^<>]* instead, you get this: https://regex101.com/r/NvuWLD/5
[04:47:37] <re101-wasp-57> https://i.imgur.com/0z72KBK.png
[04:47:45] <re101-wasp-57> check it out
[04:48:12] <OnlineCop> Right: the first <h1> there isn't part of the match. The second <h1> is.
[04:49:00] <OnlineCop> Java regex doesn't support recursion, or else you COULD nest <h1><h1>stuff</h1></h1> correctly.
[04:49:59] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/NvuWLD/6 <-- PCRE, not Java
[04:52:33] <re101-wasp-57> weird
[04:54:19] <re101-wasp-57> https://i.imgur.com/NBWSLJ8.png
[04:55:46] <OnlineCop> On regex101, you don't want `\\1`.
[04:55:57] <OnlineCop> You want `\1`.
[04:56:16] <OnlineCop> It's `\\1` when it's inside "double quotes" because the `\` character needs to be escaped: `\1` => `\\1`
[04:56:40] <re101-wasp-57> ı gotcha you

[05:05:22] <OnlineCop> That would match either the inner OR outer ones, depending on which one matched correctly.
[05:06:29] <OnlineCop> At first, `<(.+?)>` would start at <a>. But when it got to `([^<>]+)`, the first character it sees it the '<' of "<c>"
[05:06:48] <OnlineCop> Since it can't be '<' or '>', that match failed, so it started at the next '<'.

[10:14:43] <tester12> Hi ftreinds
[10:15:08] <tester12> for input a specific number I have this regex
[10:15:26] <tester12> in javascript
[10:16:09] <tester12> ^[07][0-9]{0,11}$
[10:16:33] <tester12> and sample is : 07125648989
[10:17:02] <tester12> but doesnt work correctly
[10:17:48] <tester12> the number has 12 digits and should begin with 07
[10:18:35] <digitok> ^07\d{0,10}$
[10:19:58] <tester12> sorry should have 11 digits
[10:20:08] <tester12> so {0,9}
[10:20:13] <tester12> Am I right?
[10:20:38] <digitok> is it always 11? or 11 maximum
[10:20:54] <tester12> always 11
[10:23:22] <digitok> then just {9}
[10:25:57] <tester12> doesnt work
[10:26:00] <Me-me> {0,9} means zero to nine. {9} means nine (shocking, I know).
[10:26:15] <Me-me> In this case it means 9 \d, and \d means one digit. So nine digits.
[10:26:57] <purplex> not just {9}, tester12 but ^07\d{9}$ try again :p
[10:27:26] <tester12> purplex Iknow
[10:27:33] <Me-me> This is where we ask for a regex101.com link so we can see what has occurred.
[10:27:35] <tester12> ^07\d{9}$
[10:27:51] <tester12> but doesnt work
[10:28:15] <Me-me> Please provide a regex101.com link so we can see what has occurred.
[10:28:17] <purplex> do you want to match 11 digit number which begins with 07?
[10:28:51] <tester12> in this check all regex worked like [a-zA-Z\s]{0,50}
[10:29:06] <Me-me> Alright, I tried.
[10:29:35] <digitok> damn. you guys take literally every asker
[10:29:40] <purplex> i tried too
[10:29:58] <purplex> only digitok can take him now
[10:30:12] <tester12> https://regex101.com/r/lkrAMl/1
[10:30:54] <purplex> those look like 11 digits, tester12?
[10:31:34] <tester12> yes
[10:31:46] <purplex> good, i give up
[10:32:40] <digitok> 07tester12, which is the 7th digit in that string?
[10:32:51] <tester12> https://regex101.com/r/ZJEl87/1
[10:33:19] <digitok> 07tester12, ok, which is the 7th digit in that string?
[10:34:15] <Me-me> tester12: Those test strings don't match because they're not 11 digits long.
[10:34:20] <tester12> any number, sorry in this link I forgot type number 11 digits and just type a number:b
[10:34:39] <tester12> yes right
[10:35:07] <tester12> but in my javascript test in chrome and mozilla firefox doesnt work
[10:35:36] <digitok> can you paste the line of code you are using to test
[10:35:38] <tester12> while this is a input with a numbers

[10:44:56] <purplex> do you want a number less than 11 digits to match if it begins with 07?
[10:45:28] <tester12> number exact 11 digits begins with 07
[10:45:40] <tester12> I test it again doesnt work
[10:45:43] <tester12> but
[10:46:03] <purplex> i want you to create a test with exact 11 digits on regex101
[10:46:20] <purplex> then we'll use code generator for you
[10:46:23] <tester12> when I remove 07 that worked , example \d{0,11}
[10:46:34] <tester12> but when add 0 at start
[10:47:27] <purplex> what did it work on?
[10:47:54] <tester12> no
[10:49:14] <purplex> please create a test with exact 11 digits on regex101 to confirm you are human :p
[10:53:09] <tester12> worked now=L
[10:53:48] <tester12> my javascript in main project has a bug that couldnt find it =( >.<

[14:24:41] <lavaball> ^(dr|doctor).?bob    would that now find dr or doctor at the beginning of the line or would it only find xbob?
[14:31:18] <purplex> do you want to find dr or doctor?
[14:32:12] <lavaball> that doesn't matter, i'm asking about the carrot at the beginning in front of the brackets.
[14:32:21] <lavaball> does it go as beginning of the line or as not what's in the brackets.
[14:33:00] <purplex> then yes
[14:33:19] <lavaball> you need to clarify a bit there.
[14:34:03] <purplex> it checks beginning of line for whatever you are finding since it doesn't matter
[14:34:39] <lavaball> and how would i go about it if i didn't want the doctor?
[14:35:00] <lavaball> ^^(dr) or ^[^(dr)]
[14:35:08] <purplex> remove |doctor
[14:35:44] <lavaball> oh, now i should have clarified, how do i go about at the beginning of the line but not starting with "dr".
[14:35:49] <lavaball> ?
[14:37:30] <purplex> what's the final goal here? to match bob without dr?
[14:38:42] <lavaball> no, i just want to understand how he would take the carrot in the beginning, which you have sufficiently explained already. now i wonder how i would go about: at the begining of the line not starting with word "hello" or something, since it's also ^.
[14:39:13] <lavaball> ^^? or ^[^(word)]?
[14:39:17] <lavaball> or maybe some other way.
[14:40:58] <purplex> ^(?!word) again depends what you are trying to do.
[14:42:24] <lavaball> hm, so far i did [^a-z] if i didn't want letters following, but that's as far as i got. should i have gone with (?!a-z) there as well?
[14:44:31] <purplex> depends on what you are trying to do, i can't tell unless you clarify
[14:45:50] <purplex> its like going to a doctor and not explaining the problem but asking for should i take red or green pill :p
[14:46:03] <lavaball> i didn't have a problem. now i do. so here we go: 
[14:46:19] <lavaball> i want to find .*one at the beginning of the line, but not wordone.
[14:46:28] <lavaball> how would i go about it?
[14:47:56] <digitok> haha "carrot"
[14:47:59] <digitok> awesome
[14:48:12] <lavaball> i heard that elsewhere!
[14:48:43] <digitok> it is spelled caret :p
[14:48:56] <lavaball> caret!
[14:49:02] <lavaball> i didn't know that.
[14:49:10] <digitok> carrot is cool too

[16:10:06] <TimG> Hey, Hope you could help me:
[16:10:07] <TimG> I'd like to match a pattern only when a specific word, like "lucky" exists in the text on a position before "lucky"
[16:10:27] <TimG> Do you have any ideas how to solve this? :)
[16:13:20] <TimG> Sorry that was not understandable.
[16:13:21] <TimG> Somewhere there might a  pattern I'd like to match. But I want only match it, when the word "lucky exists before.
[16:13:21] <TimG> My pattern was (?<=lucky.*)(Benjamin)
[16:30:11] <purplex> that will match if lucky is in same line with word 'Benjamin'
[16:33:53] <TimG> Just in this moment  I have noticed too. Is there a a way to match if it is ino in the same row?
[16:34:03] <TimG> Thanks for your respond:)
[16:40:11] <digitok> 07TimG, which programming language/tool, and what is the goal after matching the word?
[16:40:17] <digitok> word/pattern
[16:55:21] <TimG> I am using VB.Net or ECMAScript. The goal is to make sure that only correct will be extracted
[16:58:55] <digitok> then what you have seems ok, no?
[16:59:07] <digitok> assuming ecmascript 6 is supported
[17:00:40] <TimG> I'll try another position for the lookaround. Maybe it will work then. Thanks for your support:)
[17:01:51] <TimG> It juist seems so, that it does not match, when there is a line break.
[17:01:51] <TimG> Maybe I'll jnust replace all the linebreaks before matching
[17:04:58] <digitok> oh, it will not match if there is a linebreak
[17:05:01] <lavaball> (?: these non capture groups, do they mean don't show in the result or well, what do they do?
[17:05:23] <digitok> they just mean do not capture the contents into its own group
[17:05:36] <digitok> i.e. the groups shown under "match information" on the right of regex101
[17:06:16] <digitok> 07TimG, does your regex use the /.../ format, or is it a string "..." ?
[17:06:34] <lavaball> this regex does a lot more than i need. anyway, thanks a bunch.
[17:06:48] <TimG> Its a string. Mostly its the whole text from an imprint
[17:07:04] <digitok> 07lavaball, np
[17:07:45] <digitok> 07TimG, sorry, perhaps my question was worded badly. when you are defining the regex pattern, does it look like: regex = /(?<=foo.*)bar/ or: regex = "(?<=foo.*)bar"

[19:35:37] <Kiarash> Hello guys
[19:36:03] <OnlineCop> o/
[19:36:34] <Kiarash> i want a regex that contains \w and \. and - but "-" and "_" are not near "."
[19:36:41] <Kiarash> how can i do that?
[19:37:04] <OnlineCop> It helps if you could give a few examples of what should match, and what shouldn't.
[19:37:08] <Kiarash> ok
[19:37:20] <OnlineCop> By \w, you mean anything within the [a-zA-Z0-9_] range, correct?
[19:37:24] <Kiarash> yes
[19:37:36] <Kiarash> for example abc.- is incorrect
[19:37:46] <Kiarash> abc_. is incorrect
[19:37:57] <Kiarash> but abc-_abc. is ok
[19:38:32] <OnlineCop> Alright. Which regex flavor/language, by the way?
[19:38:37] <Kiarash> java
[19:39:07] <re101-wasp-57>  question like hackerrank
[19:39:23] <re101-wasp-57> I had solved
[19:39:36] <Kiarash> and how should i write it?
[19:39:39] <OnlineCop> Yeah; we get HackerRank questions in here on occasion. It's a good site.
[19:39:55] <Kiarash> I havent check that befor
[19:40:57] <re101-wasp-57> btw OnlineCop java compiler does not accept single '\' backslash when we compiling that's way we need to put double  ı just said as reminder thing
[19:41:31] <OnlineCop> re101-wasp-57: Right: that's why I usually direct users to use Code Generator when they get their regex working on regex101.com, since that escapes those \ backslashes for them.
[19:41:47] <Kiarash> yeah i know that one
[19:41:49] <re101-wasp-57>  ı know thanks
[19:42:12] <Kiarash> ok how should i solve the problem?
[19:42:39] <re101-wasp-57> can you share  question definition from there like link
[19:42:59] <Kiarash> its in persian
[19:43:03] <OnlineCop> Kiarash: I'm still thinking this one through.

[19:43:16] <Kiarash> let me translate it
[19:43:21] <Kiarash> thank you cop
[19:43:55] <OnlineCop> Kiarash: Is it valid or invalid to have multiple '...' together?
[19:44:03] <OnlineCop> ...abc-_abc...
[19:44:39] <Kiarash> the question is : we want a regex to check if a string contains words & numbers & _ & - & . but the only condition is that the "_" or "-" are not near "."
[19:44:45] <Kiarash> yes its vali

[19:51:11] <Kiarash> but abc() is ok
[19:51:24] <Kiarash> how should i solve this one?
[19:52:45] <OnlineCop> I had a question about Java regexes using recursion the other day. PCRE supports recursion, and .NET support Balancing Groups, but Java does not let you nest (parens(inside)other) directly (at least, not with pure regex).
[19:53:57] <Kiarash> well what should i do then?
[19:54:42] <OnlineCop> Does the solution allow a mixture of code + regex? Or, do you know the max number of (nested(parens)) that you'll have to deal with?
[19:55:31] <OnlineCop> You can always "cheat" if you know that it will ever only go 2-3 parens "deep", but if you want full recursion, you have to match the '(' character, then start matching all characters until you reach either ')' or another '('. If you reach '(', then you need to recurse.
[19:55:36] *** Joins: cthulchu_ (~Cthulchu@69-172-160-196.cable.teksavvy.com)
[19:55:49] <OnlineCop> If you reach ')', then you stop matching the current '(' and call that selection complete.
[19:56:13] <Kiarash> well
[19:56:19] <Kiarash> i didnt catch that
[19:56:33] <Kiarash> we dont know how many words will be there
[19:56:37] <Kiarash> thats one thing
[19:56:50] <OnlineCop> Non-recursive would match '-123(234)345' for example.
[19:57:03] <Kiarash> its is correct
[19:57:09] <OnlineCop> Non-recursive would also match '-123(234)345(_456_)-567'.
[19:57:23] <Kiarash> this one is correct too
[19:57:24] <OnlineCop> But you would need recursive to match '-123(234(345)_456_)-567'.
[19:57:34] <Kiarash> but 123(344))( is not
[19:57:57] <OnlineCop> Correct, since you have an open '(' followed by a close ')', followed by ANOTHER close ')'.
[19:58:43] <Kiarash> we should have pairs as i mentioned
[19:59:00] <Kiarash> it doesnt matter if anything is inside parentheses
[19:59:25] <Kiarash> but we should have a pair of () no matter where they are
[19:59:33] <Kiarash> and thats the problem
[20:00:13] <Kiarash> because when i have a string like 123()d(    my code returns true but it should be false
[20:00:27] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/HAPFVv/1 is a recursive PCRE way.
[20:00:47] <OnlineCop> Unfortunately, it doesn't work with Java, since Java regex doesn't support recursion.
[20:00:55] <Kiarash> can i convert it to java?
[20:01:15] <Kiarash> aha
[20:01:18] <Kiarash> thats ok
[20:01:27] <Kiarash> thanks a lot for your help
[20:01:46] <OnlineCop> If I were to write it in Java programmatically, I would match everything except '(' or ')'.
[20:02:25] <Kiarash> yeah i know
[20:02:34] <Kiarash> its a big problem
[20:03:10] <OnlineCop> When you encounter '(', go into a recursive function which matches '(' followed by any number of `[\d_-]`, and when that stops, see if the next character is ')'. If it is, exit the recursive function. If it is '(' instead, call the same recursive function.
[20:04:22] <OnlineCop> Some online answers for "Java regex with PCRE" comes up with JRegex.
[20:04:46] <OnlineCop> Wow, that reference was from 2014. It might not be viable anymore.
