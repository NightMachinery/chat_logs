[00:27:50] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yes yours an API and not frontend or?
[00:29:10] <Nasp> Ahh got the error now, it was just difference than i remembered :/
[00:29:13] <Suchiman> Nasp: i have a large REST API and a small cshtml frontend
[00:29:23] <Nasp> Do you handle stuff like token invalidation?
[00:29:29] <Nasp> Like if someone wants to invalidate their session NOW
[00:29:50] <Suchiman> Nasp: no, bearer tokens have 30 minutes validity and cannot be invalidated

[00:29:55] <Nasp> Ok
[00:30:11] <Nasp> We have that feature, but it was not used much
[00:30:21] <Nasp> So for each request, we ask another service "Is this token valid?"
[00:30:27] <Nasp> And it just seems such a waste
[00:30:35] <Suchiman> yeah and that's why i didn't build that feature xD
[00:30:48] <Nasp> We might be required to at some point, since then we don't have log out
[00:30:52] <Nasp> And our sessions lasts a long time
[00:30:56] <Suchiman> i wanted the token to be self contained and verifyable without making any requests
[00:31:14] <Nasp> But what i wanted to do was just have a blacklist in memory of all blacklisted sessions
[00:31:38] <Nasp> Because for each Http request, we make another http request to another service to ask "Is this valid"
[00:31:47] <Nasp> That's expensive and fragile
[00:31:52] <Suchiman> yeah
[00:31:54] <Nasp> And someone added even more checks like these
[00:32:06] <Nasp> So i think we ask 4 difference services
[00:32:17] <Nasp> Because then there's permissions and another set of permissions from  a difference service
[00:32:27] <Nasp> And yeah, me no likey, but it was easy for people to add like that, so they did
[00:32:35] <Suchiman> i suppose it would be possible to send a blacklist via webhook to services
[00:32:53] <Nasp> Yeah, or just poll the existing backend service ever x seconds
[00:33:06] <Nasp> Instead of wasting 5-20ms and exhauting the connection pool :D
[00:33:24] <Nasp> I have a feeling the massive amount of tasks we spawn in framework isn't great
[00:34:08] <Suchiman> I'd wish i wouldn't have to await stuff
[00:34:20] <Suchiman> because that makes code ugly, especially chained code :P
[00:35:12] <Nasp> Yup
[00:35:34] <Nasp> I would also maybe prefer if it was "no await" when you didn't want to
[00:35:49] <Nasp> Also can't you make your own awaitable Task type?
[00:36:41] <Suchiman> Nasp: yes you can
[00:37:54] <Nasp> Because i hate "public async Task<ActionResult<IList<Stuff>>> GetStuff()"
[00:38:23] <Nasp> Also you sometimes need to make a method or interface async, if in the future it could be needed
[00:38:32] <Nasp> Then you avoid needing to change the entire callstack
[00:38:42] <Nasp> Although i think i saw someone tried to make an analyzer / codefix for that
[00:38:46] <Nasp> That would be very nice

[01:48:45] <Nasp> Like i tried to remove the double oauth middleware
[01:48:48] <Nasp> And that works on core
[01:49:07] <Nasp> But when i hit framework, it does'nt know how to redirect an unauthenticated user
[01:50:14] <Suchiman> ah, I'm using OAuth, not OIDC and there's no generic OAuth client middleware on framework so i forked google's or facebook OAuth provider xD

[01:51:46] <Nasp> But i really dont want to
[01:52:36] <Suchiman> Nasp: do you have something like OIDCAuthenticationOptions.Provider.OnApplyRedirect?
[01:53:00] <Nasp> Yes i just tested that, and those events dont fire
[01:53:26] <Suchiman> Nasp: is the middleware configured as active or passive?
[01:53:37] <Nasp> I have no idea
[01:53:42] <Nasp> Also i removed the OIDC middleware
[01:54:33] <Suchiman> OIDCAuthenticationOptions.AuthenticationMode configures if it's active or passive
[01:54:43] <Nasp> What's the difference?
[01:54:58] <Nasp> But problem is i have two middlewares i think doing stuff with the same request
[01:55:03] <Suchiman> active means it will automatically authenticate while passive middlewares need to be challenged
[01:55:33] <Suchiman> like Authentication.Challenge("OAuth");
[01:55:37] <Nasp> Ahh
[01:55:40] <Nasp> But not sure if that helps me
[01:56:33] <Suchiman> although it will try to decode the authentication if it's present, the challenge part just means whether that middleware gets to be the one that performs the redirect

[02:33:58] <JD-Robbs> It's essentially so I can attach references to child objects. E.g.

[03:49:22] <scalablecory> i am currently jumping into the future --- i'm learning Orleans and architecting a huge thing on top of it
[03:49:41] <Suchiman> scalablecory: cool, is that related to your work on HttpClient or some hobby thing on the side?
[03:50:07] <scalablecory> it's a hobby thing on the side
[03:50:22] <Nasp> I stil ldont get Orleans :D
[03:50:36] <Nasp> It seems like a beast, like Dapr
[03:50:41] <Suchiman> I think i understand Orleans but i don't understand when to use it
[03:50:51] <JakeSays> Nasp: i used to work with a guy who worshiped orleans
[03:50:56] <Nasp> I think i understand some of the concept but it just seems rather huge
[03:51:01] <Nasp> And something you go all in one
[03:51:04] <JakeSays> this fucker uses it everywhere
[03:51:18] <Nasp> Orleans, Dapr, Akka
[03:51:22] <Suchiman> scalablecory: what kind of thing are you building with it?
[03:51:23] <Nasp> Isn't that the 3 big ones
[03:51:25] <scalablecory> it's basically a database for single-threaded stateful object instances.
[03:51:39] <scalablecory> that can scale out and failover really easily
[03:52:46] <scalablecory> i'm basically going all-in on it and trying to build a big fault-tolerant thing that'll let me flip a switch and turn an Azure region off and the app will keep runnin
[03:52:49] <Nasp> What i would really like is to look into some kind of sharding
[03:53:06] * JakeSays prefers sharting
[03:53:07] <Nasp> scalablecory:  Well can't you turn a region off now?
[03:53:28] <Suchiman> scalablecory: cool, i remember the early demos with orleans and service fabric with rolling updates and all that stuff
[03:54:12] <scalablecory> Nasp: outside of embarassingly parallel apps, it can be very challenging to make apps geo-distributed
[03:54:29] <JakeSays> y'all should help me get the service fabric source released
[03:54:33] <Nasp> scalablecory: Isnt the only limitation usually the database
[03:54:40] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Why?
[03:54:46] <JakeSays> because i want it
[03:54:48] <Nasp> That's dead tech
[03:54:52] <Suchiman> JakeSays: what you mean? https://github.com/Microsoft/service-fabric
[03:54:55] <bpmedley> JakeSays : What are service fabrics?
[03:55:05] <JakeSays> Suchiman: that source is 3 years old. i want the latest
[03:55:05] <scalablecory> Nasp: Orleans can currently do "distributed" super well. it can do "geo-distributed" sorta-kinda but really it doesn't do much of the work for you.t
[03:55:11] <Nasp> Microsofts failed attempt at some distributed shit
[03:55:17] <JakeSays> Nasp: it's not dead tech
[03:55:20] <Nasp> We almost went with it, and then went with docker instead
[03:55:52] <Nasp> scalablecory: Sure, but isn't it only going to continue with the data that's replicated to another datacenter
[03:55:57] <Nasp> So certain shards still works?
[03:56:01] <Suchiman> Nasp: ARM is powered by service fabric
[03:56:04] <Nasp> Data is usually the problem when going distributed
[03:56:09] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I know

[03:56:27] <JakeSays> ah
[03:56:30] <Nasp> Microsoft setup a meeting for us with B&O and how they used service fabric
[03:56:30] <brianonymous> you and yer ms clouds
[03:56:37] <Nasp> And then they kidna recommended against it
[03:56:41] <Suchiman> lol
[03:56:50] <Nasp> Two hours meeting, and after the meeting we all sat down, had a beer and "yes, docker it is"
[03:57:18] <Nasp> Some of the keypoints was that the load balancing didn't work correctly
[03:57:21] <JakeSays> y'all just need to go add a comment to an issue
[03:57:34] <Nasp> So they sent headers around, and verified it on the receiver end that they were talking to the correct service
[03:57:42] <Nasp> Also you need as much memory as you want storage
[03:57:58] <Nasp> And then it had this annoying thing back then that you couldn't run two of the same service on the same node
[03:58:02] <Nasp> Although they fixed that one later afaik
[03:58:10] <Nasp> JakeSays:  comment?
[03:58:31] <JakeSays> yes, asking for the source to be released
[03:58:42] <Nasp> Ahh
[03:58:50] <Nasp> What do you want it for?

[05:08:44] <Nasp> Also MS didn't even manage to make support for DAteOnly in System.Text
[05:09:08] <Nasp> bpmedley: Ahhh yes, i remember readin that a month ago
[05:09:54] <lz_> I was watching some tvshow and I was wondering why the subtitles were all over the place
[05:10:21] <lz_> turned out it was some rip from some muslim country where they remove scenes they think have too much women parts in it
[05:10:38] <lz_> I also noticed they fucking BLURRED some necks wtf
[05:10:51] <lz_> so I found another uncensored version and tried comparing them. It's not the only thing they do
[05:11:00] <lz_> they also reframe scenes entirely to remove women
[05:11:02] <lz_> that's so pathetic
[05:12:05] <lz_> there wasn't even any nudity in the first place
[05:12:26] <lz_> if you want to live in the stone age, maybe just don't watch tvshows at all, I don't know
[05:13:27] <lz_> imagine your job is to remove women from tv shows
[05:13:56] <lz_> yuck

[09:12:24] <ravindUwU> oof
[09:12:31] <ravindUwU> why's that lol
[09:12:48] <bpmedley> ravindUwU : I'm hopeful that maui will be effective for business and commercial apps.  Perhaps you're asking if maui will be known for gorgeous ui that flutter seems to be?  I'm actually hopeful that maui be more practical and developer friendly than gorgeous.
[09:12:51] <bomb> Flutter is safe bet (despite Google) since it's gonna be the SDK of Fuchsia
[09:12:59] <bomb> Fuchsia will replace Android.
[09:13:57] <bpmedley> bomb : Is there a specific aspect to maui that makes you feel it's doa?
[09:14:56] <bomb> reason #1 it's from Microsoft
[09:15:37] <ravindUwU> tsk
[09:16:05] <bomb> IMHO Microsoft is very confused about client-side
[09:16:23] <bpmedley> bomb : Do you think Blazor is a step in the right direction?
[09:16:47] <bomb> bpmedley oh absolutely. Flutter Web uses full-screen canvas to render all the widgets. YUCK
[09:17:14] * ravindUwU pukes
[09:17:20] <bomb> bpmedley current .NET web stack is top notch. it's native client-side where Microsoft seems to be very confused.
[09:17:43] <bpmedley> I'm not very familiar with Flutter.  Yeah, I really enjoy .Net web stack.
[09:17:48] <bomb> Flutter (iOS/Droid) + Blazor (web) + ASP.NET (backend) is a killer combo IMHO
[09:18:26] <bomb> bpmedley what do you use for front-end web right now?
[09:18:37] <bpmedley> Telerik Blazor for ASP .Net
[09:18:47] <bpmedley> At work we use jQuery and Bootstrap

[14:23:12] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Exactly
[14:23:15] <interop_madness> Nasp, the real question is: Why would anybody want to survive a nuclear war
[14:23:26] <Nasp> Like if it's an invasion it will be slow enough to see it coming
[14:23:35] <Nasp> If it's a nuke, the point is moot

[14:23:53] <Suchiman> interop_madness: playin some real life fallout :P
[14:24:03] <Nasp> Someone from a city complained that 200k people were without a shelter
[14:24:09] <interop_madness> Russia has made abundantly clear that 1. They WILL use nuclear weapons and 2. They see no use for a world without Russia as a player
[14:24:12] <Nasp> Space for 600K people in a 800K city
[14:24:33] <interop_madness> Russia's military doctrine also considers tactical nuclear weapons as a mere extension of conventional warfare
[14:24:40] <Nasp> It just seems like there's a lot of alarmist as well
[14:26:49] <Nasp> interop_madness: Their onventional warfare doesn't seem to go well
[14:27:23] <interop_madness> Nasp, yes, hence it's a possibility they will resort to tactical nuclear weapons
[14:27:35] <interop_madness> Given that NATO has clearly ruled out any engangement in Ukraine
[14:29:18] <Nasp> Yeah but it still doesn't change anything

[14:46:01] <ap5> True :)

[14:47:11] <ap5> And the premise, that the [whatever]coin, isn't based on a currency, is bullshit ... When ever we talk about how much a bitcoin is worth, we map it do USD

[15:10:48] <MaNa2k> why ?
[15:11:01] <khanred> What is consulting like?
[15:11:08] <ap5> It was kind of special place i was at
[15:11:29] <cloaker> Consulting job can be rewarding in early career
[15:11:37] <ap5> Ecommerce. We started projects, and then we had them in house afterwards
[15:11:43] <ap5> cloaker, true
[15:11:45] <cloaker> you get to travel which you can because you are yet to make a family and have other responsibilities
[15:12:10] <ap5> cloaker, i never travelled
[15:12:13] <cloaker> Also, you can switch to other clients and projects which give you greater exposure and perspective which is immensely helpful in building your future career
[15:12:19] <ap5> cloaker, that is true

[15:13:37] <MaNa2k> or lots of mails
[15:13:42] <MaNa2k> how to do keep track of projects
[15:13:49] <cloaker> MaNa2k, when you are onsite, it is usually face to face
[15:14:00] <cloaker> I am not a manager though so I am focused on tech talks

[15:15:34] <MatthiasVance> khanred: Then you're never going to achieve it? xD
[15:15:42] <MaNa2k> cloaker, do you communicate with customers or are you just assigned tasks ?

[15:16:40] <cloaker> in my current role in the product company, I still do communicate to business and other stake holders
[15:16:45] <MaNa2k> mhm, because right now, in my current, we all communicate with a projectmanager, who communicates with the customer
[15:17:15] <cloaker> I think it is not different from consulting but in consulting you got to have some degree of servitude to serve the clients
[15:17:44] <cloaker> In product company I feel more empowered to say no.
[15:18:15] <cloaker> its subtle, but something one has to factor
[15:18:17] <khanred> uh
[15:18:44] <MaNa2k> cloaker, mhm. in my current work, our customers mainly need some sort of accounting integration, and every company has their own way of speaking accounting language with confuses the heck out of us devs
[15:19:21] <MaNa2k> therefore we have middleman how both speak accounting and has enough data skills to transalte that to us devs
[15:19:28] <MaNa2k> *who
[15:19:33] <cloaker> MaNa2k, why not publish a contract and have components which transform to the contract
[15:19:50] <cloaker> ahhh you mean human speaking

[15:19:54] <MaNa2k> lol
[15:20:08] <khanred> gross
[15:20:43] <cloaker> but devs are not supposed to directly interact with business. There must be BA or PO to abstract and fill the void
[15:21:33] <cloaker> devs can surely be groomed to speak and understand business language but it is unfair to put devs in front of business for interaction. It is frustrating for both.
[15:22:15] <MatthiasVance> As long as you have a domain expert that's fine

[18:16:01] <bomb> jonp still reading. sounds like another NPM package compromised by hackers
[18:16:38] <blez> just like fakerjs, but this time about the russia/ukraine thing
[18:17:38] <Tobbi_> Anyone familiar with DbContext scaffolding?
[18:17:45] <xb0o2> Not compromised by hackers, the maintainer introduced some malicious behaviour protesting the war in Ukraine
[18:18:01] <Tobbi_> Do I need to re-scaffold after adding a column to my table or can I simply add the column to my model and be done with it?

[18:24:51] <bomb> it's amusing. developers have no clue what code running in their programs

[18:26:10] <bomb> not having a thousand nested dependencies is a good start I guess
[18:26:22] <Suchiman> jonp: are you saying you don't disassemble every binary you've compiled and check if it does what you want?
[18:26:42] <bomb> then not auto-updating in production is a very good idea

[18:27:32] <xb0o2> Get a computer to do it for you

[18:28:01] <brianonymous> bpmedley: you there my homie
[18:28:40] <lz_> I guess the site could break because of an update but isn't it better than the site getting broken or compromised because it's out of date

[23:28:08] <JakeSays> the one that died was a 68 year old civilian
[23:28:38] <bomb> loons like Forward Observations Group
[23:28:44] <bomb> ah, poor guy
[23:37:03] <JakeSays> bomb: he probably married a young ukrainian woman. now he's been putin'd
[23:39:05] <BSaboia> JakeSays, well, he could've in theory left Ukraine by now, no?
[23:39:35] <BSaboia> Only citizens were required to stay. I have two Brazilian friends that were able to left Ukraine before thing went South there
[23:39:42] <bomb> evictions being very difficult BSaboia
[23:40:07] <BSaboia> Hmm yes, they told me that trains to Poland were totally overbooked
[23:40:22] <BSaboia> I am not sure on the reality there. But I am pretty sure it must be darn hard now
[23:40:34] <JakeSays> BSaboia: sure, but there's a lot of reasons why he'd want to stay
[23:40:35] <bomb> yeah, and in some cities they don't let civilians leave
[23:41:06] <BSaboia> JakeSays, yeah, of course. I also saw on TV here the other day a guy that stayed because of his family. He is a soccer player
[23:41:15] <BSaboia> I mean, football. REAL football

[23:47:06] <JakeSays> lol apparently some men are trying to leave ukraine in drag
[23:47:37] <DevJohnC> people desperate to leave a warzone by any means necessary doesn't sound very "lol" to me
[23:48:10] <bomb> ^
[23:49:16] <JakeSays> i find it cowardly, so yeah lol
[23:51:21] <JakeSays> one dressed in his wife's clothes, stole her passport, took their baby and left her behind.
[23:53:33] <DoofusCanadensis> okay that one is bad
[23:54:10] <bomb> she can just walk into Poland
[23:54:21] <DevJohnC> well, it _sounds_ bad, but most if not all of us here are unqualified to judge a person fleeing for their life and their childs life
[23:54:56] <bomb> yep
[23:55:10] <JakeSays> he should've sent his wife and baby.
[23:55:25] <megaTherion> ^ indeed
[23:55:33] <DevJohnC> for all you know his wife refused to leave
[23:55:37] <bomb> what if the woman refuses to leave
[23:56:05] <JakeSays> then you bonk her over the head and carry her out.
[23:56:12] <megaTherion> :D
[23:56:31] <DevJohnC> it's so fucking easy to sit in a nice home a million miles away from where people are dying, bombs are exploding and civvies are being targeted and judge somebody because you think they're a coward; there's no risk to you, after all, and you think men should just be manly mucho men
[23:56:34] <DoofusCanadensis> how very cromagnon of you
[23:56:41] <DevJohnC> fuck that and fuck you, you lack empathy and it's disturbing
[23:56:44] * DevJohnC peace out
[23:57:06] * bomb hugs DevJohnC 
[23:57:10] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: whatever dude.
