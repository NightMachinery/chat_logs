[14:50:48] <thomasb06> alright, let's go
[14:50:49] <beach> There is "portacle" that packages all that stuff so that it's easier to install.
[14:51:52] <thomasb06> found: https://portacle.github.io/
[14:54:16] <beach> Yeah.  It might have bitrotted a bit.  If you are brave, just do Emacs, then SBCL (binary from website, then Quicklisp, then use Quicklisp to install slime-helper.

[15:16:06] <beach> If you installed SBCL the normal way, it will be in /usr/local/bin/ I think.
[15:16:21] <bremner> thomasb06: what OS?
[15:16:45] <beach> Also, it is best to install SLIME using the slime-helper library from quicklisp.
[15:16:53] <thomasb06> in /usr/bin/sbcl the shortest. Ubuntu

[15:17:23] <thomasb06> let me check
[15:18:07] <beach> Since you didn't follow my advice, I am not sure where it got installed.
[15:18:55] <thomasb06> it's seems it worked though, I have `CL-USER> ` in a buffer now
[15:19:12] <thomasb06> can I load a file from this prompt?
[15:20:28] <bremner> I'm far from a slime expert, but installing from debian has worked ok for me. It might be because I'm running debian testing and that is fairly recent.

[20:50:44] <Demosthenex> sp o
[20:51:18] <Demosthenex> so i'm making an object which has string and integer fields. how can i make equal use the right one based on data type. i was reading i can't just define generic methods/
[20:52:47] <beach> You can't alter what EQUAL does.
[20:53:01] <beach> And standard objects have "slots", not "fields". 
[20:53:28] <Demosthenex> so, i'm trying to use trivia match, and i've tokenized my input data into objects 
[20:53:48] <Demosthenex> i just wanted it to automatically match strings vs my string slot, and ints vs the int slot
[20:54:08] <beach> That's easy.  Just write a function that does the comparison.
[20:56:04] <Demosthenex> i guess part of it is trivia:match, it says it dynamically uses eq,eql, equal, guess i need to find the docs on that
[20:56:30] <beach> I guess.  I don't know trivia, so I can't help you there.

[21:50:59] *** Quits: treflip (~user@user/treflip) (Quit: good night!)
[21:52:40] <beach> It is not likely that EQL is a generic function in your implementation, and you can not redefine standard functions. 
[21:54:14] <beach> And I don't know what it means to "defgeneric over" something.

[22:34:28] <White_Flame> technically you could shadow cl:equal with your own package's (defgeneric equal (a b) ..), but that obviously wouldn't integrate with anything already compiled to CL's equal.  It'd just be easy syntax for your own code

[22:45:26] <Demosthenex> i've traced where it makes it's determinations, and its just deep enough i can't quite grok how to patch it
[22:46:39] <Demosthenex> i just want all keywords, strings, and integers in a trivia:match statement to use my obj slot instead of specifying (obj (slot val)) for each one
[22:46:48] <Demosthenex> declutter :P
