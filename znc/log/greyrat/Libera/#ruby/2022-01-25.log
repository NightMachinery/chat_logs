[14:25:39] <leah2> good
[14:26:28] <leah2> > case "foo"; else :foo; when "bar"; bar; end
[14:27:18] <leah2> hm, in which language did that work
[14:39:28] <IsoLinCHiP> So, I have rbenv setup and working. I just ran `gem install bundler -v '< 2.0, >=1.3.0' (dont judge, need to fix an old rails app), it installed version 1.17.3 . But running `bundle _1.17.3_ --version` yields Version 2.0.2 (the other version thats installed on the machine).
[14:40:59] <IsoLinCHiP> If I specify a bogus version in the __ it complains it doesnt find it, so the version loading apears to be working.
[14:41:04] <jhass[m]> if you `which bundle`, where does it go?
[14:41:26] <IsoLinCHiP> to the rbenv shim
[14:43:15] <jhass[m]> mmh, weird. Does it actually crap out when trying to use it for the app?
[14:45:36] <IsoLinCHiP> Honestly, I hadnt tried yet, because verion said it would be incompatible, but worth a short, indeed ;)

[14:46:21] <IsoLinCHiP> Yeah, sadly it still says its the wrong bundler version when running install
[14:47:02] <jhass[m]> the 2.0 changes aren't all that breaking, mostly in the lockfile format. Might be worth a shot to just bundle update --bundler and see where it goes

[19:44:08] <IsoLinCHiP> Well, Ill be honest, I dont understand how bundler would be able to use an older version without manipulating the loadpath.
[19:44:33] <IsoLinCHiP> since it just does `require bundler` eventually
[19:47:59] <IsoLinCHiP> I traced through RBENVDEBUG output and saw that it eventually resolves the _1.17.3_ paramter to a load to the above path. But then inside that it just does requires bundler without specifying any absolute or relative path. So, the way I understand ruby load mechanism it needs to travers the $LOAD_PATH. Which simply doesnt look like it includes the versioned gem.
[19:48:54] <IsoLinCHiP> So by prepending to LOAD_PATH via the RUBYLIB env it tries resolves to the correct version now aparently

[19:53:08] <IsoLinCHiP> Well that its the wrong version of bundler. Im trying to fix an ancient project which still requires rails 4.2, which hard depends on bundler < 2.0

[20:03:50] <adam12> IsoLinCHiP: If this doesn't work, I'd try installing a newer version of Bundler. The newest supported for your Ruby version (which should be the latest in 2.3). It should auto-switch and if it's not, maybe it's a bug in the 2.0.x lineage of bundler you're using.
[20:04:23] <IsoLinCHiP> Im rather hesitant to try to reproduce the error, since this issue is halting me fixing a critical bug in my app.
[20:05:36] <IsoLinCHiP> Is bundler < 2.0 still being maintained? If not, Id chalk it up to us running antiquated software and not bother with a bug report.

[21:39:25] <ox1eef> adam12: rather than type-checking, I would just call to_i and let whatever is invalid be 0 and not impact the result.
[21:40:52] <adam12> ox1eef: I guess it would depend on the dataset I was fed. I'd rather `Integer(v, raise: false)` possibly, but these kinds of decisions are generally where the most bugs lie :P

[21:41:39] <adam12> If the dataset has mixed types, perhaps that's a sign that there's something wrong elsewhere. Confident Ruby style.
[21:41:43] <ox1eef> indeed, context is key - generally to_i is best for integers or nil.
[21:42:16] <adam12> I'd just be worried about something casting that should. "14 Foobars".to_i
[21:42:22] <adam12> That shouldn't, rather.

[21:47:36] <adam12> This will lose precision if you had a Float passed in when you weren't expecting it. I'd almost rather just pick out the non-natural values. I did it inside the same block to save another iteration through the collection, but there's no reason it couldn't be separate. 
[21:59:11] <ox1eef> the code you wrote was exactly what i thought of while AFK. :) it's a nice trick for the majority of cases.
