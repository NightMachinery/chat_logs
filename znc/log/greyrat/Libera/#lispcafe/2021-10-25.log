[18:15:45] <mfiano> Writing custom modules and macros to make it more manageable and bundle related concepts, and not just a procedural series of steps.
[18:17:18] <mfiano> It is common that feature B requires feature A to be configured and then feature B to be post-configured, for example. That is a simplified example of the delinearized mind-warping configuration files that need to be written for a sophisticated configuration. Usually the dependency graph is much larger.

[21:50:37] <gilberth> Good morning #lispcafe!
[22:05:08] * gilberth attempts to hack a GLR parser.
[22:05:51] <ck_> hack it to do what? parse the other direction?
[22:06:24] <gilberth> Rather the other dimension.
[22:07:32] <gilberth> I'd like to have a C parser that can do without knowing whether some identifier is a type or not.
[22:09:15] <gilberth> In particular parsing the same typedef twice should be possible. General problem is that the C grammar is context sensitive; "a*b;" could be either 'a' times 'b' or 'b' declared as a pointer to 'a'.
[22:12:11] <gilberth> In C you could do by lexical tie-ins. C++ is worse as the meaning of sth could depend on something following. But I am not concerned with C++.

[23:16:58] <gilberth> Hmm, I begin to believe that it actually is my keyboard doing strange things with the key labeled as "Caps Lock". I configured it as control key, somehow <caps-lock>+<alt>+<a> isn't send at all, I believe. <control left>+<alt>+<a> is fine though. *sigh*
[23:20:13] <ck_> does it work if you tap escape instead of holding alt?
[23:23:15] <gilberth> Sure. Then it would be <esc>, <caps-lock>+<a>
[23:23:43] <semz> Might be rollover.
[23:23:52] <ck_> yeah that's why I asked
[23:24:19] <semz> "who is ever going to press caps lock alt and a at the same time"
[23:24:53] <ck_> just load himem.sys, that'll fix it
[23:25:22] <gilberth> The strange thing is that Parallels and or the X server there, see that particular chord. Even without any window manager, the focus of a window would be stolen. So perhaps the keyboard is fine? But on my laptop that everything is fine, it's only my keyboard attached to the other Mac, not behaving.
[23:26:10] <gilberth> Hence something is happing on that chord.
[23:26:35] * gilberth unplugs the keyboard and connects it to the laptop.
[23:27:59] <gilberth> Nah, is also behaving strange. I need another keyboard then.
[23:29:24] <gilberth> Or a soldering iron to modify the key matrix. But this is the only keyboard I have here. I have some spare at my house though, but that doesn't help.
[23:29:53] <gilberth> ck_: So, yes, I believe that this is a rollover issue.
