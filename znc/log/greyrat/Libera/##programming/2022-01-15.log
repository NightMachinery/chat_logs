I would not worry in failure in the Linux security as an end user consumable produce, but more in the compilers and the changes that are happening on platforms, hardware support quality, drivers and performance on existing long life systems compared to vulnerability and supported versions

[04:26:28] <InPhase> basilisk: And often they are found at the stage of not yet being serious problems, but being possible problems under certain conditions.
[04:27:08] <Tech_8> im sure there are worms and viruses for linux, maybe not as much as windows
[04:27:18] <FloridaMan> yes most definitely
[04:27:34] <Tech_8> but still people lie and say not its most secure and there are not
[04:27:35] <FloridaMan> takes more stupid than usual to have issues with those though lol

[04:29:12] <FloridaMan> most virii and other malware become issues because someone did something silly and insecure, not because of any hacking or whatever... Linux users tend to be more astute with security than others in general, which is likely well they're less prevalent
[04:29:13] <basilisk> the security model is far different
[04:29:24] <FloridaMan> the issues are also patched fairly quickly depending on a number of factors

[04:38:33] <basilisk> InPhase: Well most botnets (Mirai-style) seem to be on Linux, though most propagate through telnet brute-force
[04:38:36] <InPhase> basilisk: That said, I think there are plenty of opportunities to do things better.  Adding rust drivers, slowly at first and then ramping up once this proves itself, is probably a good start.

[05:59:25] <epony> I don't use JS.
[05:59:53] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> they give you pictures and youre actually ranking them, selecting the most relevant in the list which feeds into their ALGO
[06:01:51] <epony> the real problem is.. the generic search and other primitive and expected "accessible" pages of Google are often JS blocking some click-through verification.. which prevents browsers without JS
[06:02:15] <epony> that's for example a problem on Youtube (YT)
[06:03:14] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> well yeah dude, they have to block that though otherwise people could just use their ALGO for free
[06:03:21] <epony> so.. the solution to this problem is.. alternative frontends that either use their API or scrape the front page and give you JS-less life back
[06:03:38] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> imagine how easy would be to create your own GOOG if they didn't block bots
[06:04:03] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> the entire operation is just a single text box input
[06:04:06] <epony> we don't care about GOOG's private sauce ;-) and don't need their "push-over" force-fed service most of the time
[06:04:34] <epony> technically there are alternative search engines and URL parameter passing is still an option
[06:04:46] <epony> so JS-less life is quite alright

[06:05:57] <epony> sometimes you need it briefly but most of the time, not at all
[06:06:13] <epony> it's like a hazmat suit when going to the mall
[06:06:15] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> GOOG will largely be irrelevant in the META verse. the problem of matching a query to a piece of content will be fully solved at that point

[08:22:36] <UPXTcgv7> Maybe you do not use long searches and do not type, then click back to another insertion point instead of hitting the arrow key to go back.  Also, it is a distraction which limits a typical user from remembering all things one has to type, thereby limiting one from typing and typing correctly.  Why excuse bad software design?

[11:50:38] <mrig> Found a cool go package with which you can do similar in golang too which is pretty cool
[11:50:58] <mrig> so when it is plain number crunching the code gets a boost.
[11:52:21] <mrig> for once a use case where a lib really is warranted :D
[11:52:46] <mrig> what are you coding?
[11:52:50] <mrig> or up to?

[11:53:52] <mrig> yes it has it quirks too that is for sure, but is very workable.
[11:54:41] <mrig> It is very simple to cross compile and distribute too which is nice.
[11:54:53] <mrig> it is all about distribution of load.
[11:55:58] <mrig> This seems to offset the inconvenience of the GC.

[13:54:51] <arahael> Microsoft Terminal has a _very_ pleasant default font.
[13:55:18] <Decker> it's alright - it's better now - used to run right up to the edge... made stacked terminals hard to read
[13:55:51] <arahael> I see it does have a sensible margin.
[13:56:00] <arahael> I like it, thanks for the suggestion. :D
[13:56:00] <Decker> arahael also, it only support vt100 mouse/extra key input - it's not a real conhost, so apps written to get windows events don't nesseciarly work... the keys come in a groups of keys from a 0 key id device
[13:56:27] <arahael> It's OK.  My main motivation is to get access to my linux tmux instance...
[13:56:37] <arahael> So that I can have it in my VR games. :D  Now I can VR *and* IRC!
[13:56:46] <Decker> ya terminal things seem to work ok - and various VIs
[13:56:54] <Decker> nice :)
[13:59:23] <arcticblue> If you're feeling adventurous, you can run terminal emulators like Tilix from the WSL2 environment too now that it supports graphical applications seemlessly.  Some tweaking is required to get a decent GTK theme though (unless you really like Adwaita).  
[14:00:04] <arahael> Oh, blegh. Looks like I might need to be adventurious...  Microsoft Terminal does not appear to support the mouse.
[14:00:26] <Decker> arahael it does - but it's on the application to get it

[23:49:38] <GeDaMo> They have automatic memory management

[23:50:00] <ProfSimm> I'm not talking about their internal storage management
[23:50:23] <ProfSimm> Say, you can describe a graph with SQL
[23:50:30] <ProfSimm> And you can have cycles in that graph
[23:50:48] <ProfSimm> There's no mechanism for collecting those
[23:51:09] <GeDaMo> SQL deals with flat tables, anything else you think you've seen them do is an illusion :P
[23:51:41] <ProfSimm> I guess set algebra is an illsuion
[23:52:22] <ProfSimm> I'm thinking what if we combine the idea of linear types, and weak references.
[23:52:37] <ProfSimm> We get something like SQL. You have a single "place' for a row to be. It's in the table.
[23:52:48] <ProfSimm> You can't reference it directly, you use the PK
[23:52:54] <ProfSimm> And so all references to it act like weak refs.
[23:53:01] <ProfSimm> If the PK goes away, you have broken FKs
[23:53:02] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[23:53:22] <ProfSimm> Why isn't this a viable approach to computing in general
[23:53:34] <deniska> unless you have FK constraints :)
[23:53:38] <ProfSimm> Sure
[23:53:43] <ProfSimm> We can have triggers and so on
