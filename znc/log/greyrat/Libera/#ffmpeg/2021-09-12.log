[01:22:52] <vtorri65> does someone have an idea when the next ffmpeg release will be out ?
[01:24:08] <BtbN> 4.4.1 just came out yesterday
[01:25:42] <CODECmadness> Hi. Got a problem here. I have a MKV file, HEVC+AC3. When I re-encode the audio to AC3, ffmpeg adds a small delay to the resulting audio, something like 6-8ms. If I simply copy audio and video for testing there's no delay. Why is this delay happening and/or how can I prevent it?
[01:44:38] <CODECmadness> A hint, maybe?
[01:45:49] <JEEB> priming samples, possibly? not sure how much of that AC-3 has
[01:46:11] <JEEB> AAC has 1024 and so far none of the audio formats seem to have a flag for "skip me" for that
[01:47:12] <JEEB> so it's up to the container to do that, and I'm not sure ffmpeg.c handles that stuff correctly. at least when decoding into a WAV it just sees negative timestamps and that WAV doesn't support that -> it just moves the negative start to zero
[01:52:31] <CODECmadness> Thanks JEEB!!. I'll need to investigate ir further to understand how it works internally.

[06:53:34] <tm512> so I'm writing a filter chain, using split to duplicate my video stream into streams called vl and vr, then doing additional filtering, where I have something like "[vl]crop=iw/2:ih:0:0"
[06:54:15] <tm512> do I have to specify a new output name for this, or after this filter, is the cropped video going to be in the "vl" stream for future filters to work with
[06:54:36] <furq> you need an output label
[06:55:11] <furq> unless the next filter just takes one video input in which case you can use ,
[06:56:11] <tm512> alright. well the next filter is gonna be working on the "vr" stream
[06:58:19] *** Joins: jos2 (~jos3@dyndsl-178-142-067-240.ewe-ip-backbone.de)
[07:06:04] <DeHackEd> at the end of the filter series you would have a label like [output1]  that seems like a dead end. in the rest of the commandline you can put -map '[output1]' and that output goes into the video. don't forget to add -map 0:a so some audio goes in for example
[07:08:02] <tm512> already got the audio working fine, using amix on two input streams without specifying any output label, no need for -map
[07:10:03] <DeHackEd> I think I might be missing some more context here. vl is just a label so that the output of one filter can find its way to the input of the other
[07:14:54] <furq> the question is whether [foo]crop;[foo]scale works
[07:14:57] <furq> it does not

[07:19:32] <tm512> I mentioned what I'm trying to do like, nearly 10mo ago at this point, had to dig into my IRC logs to see what the suggested solution was. I'm trying to record the output of a nintendo ds emulator, which only provides options to scale both screens at the same factor. when horizontally displayed this results in a 16:6 aspect ratio

[07:19:58] <tm512> so I'm basically trying to split the video stream in two, scaling down the secondary screen, then stitching the screens back together
[07:20:23] <tm512> I've pretty much got a filter string to try out, gonna test that here in a moment
[07:20:46] <tm512> it ended up being "[0:v]split[vl0][vr0];[vl0]crop=iw/2:ih:0:0[vl1];[vr0]crop=iw/2:ih:ow:0,scale=256:-2,pad=256:576[vr1];[vl1][vr1]hstack"

[07:29:17] <tm512> getting "stream specifier :v matches no streams"
[07:30:27] <tm512> presumably it's talking about the input [0:v] to the split filter, but I don't know what's wrong about that
[07:30:36] <furq> i take it you're not using -map
[07:30:49] <furq> or any other option with :v
[07:32:34] <tm512> setting it to [2:v] works. I thought 0:v just meant the first video stream, because elsewhere in the filter chain I'm using 0:a and 1:a for my mic input and loopback inputs, so I can set their volume separately before passing them into amix

[07:37:18] <furq> oh right
[07:37:24] <furq> v:0 would be the first video stream
[07:37:42] <furq> i think you can omit that first input label and it'll just pull whatever the first video stream is
[07:39:45] <tm512> so eventually I'd like to add scaling to bring the output to 720p, instead of this weird 576p that the emulator shows on screen at 3x scaling. is it possible to have two scale filters using different filtering algorithms? I don't want to scale up to 720p using bilinear filtering, and scaling up using nearest-neighbor also gives some pretty bad looking results iirc
[07:40:29] <tm512> I'd like to take the input and scale it to like 2x using nearest neighbor, and then have a second scaling filter to bring that down to 720p using bilinear
[07:43:28] <furq> scale=iw*2:ih*2:flags=neighbor,scale=-2:720:flags=bilinear
[07:44:17] <furq> you should probably capture at native res if you're doing that
[07:45:01] <tm512> thanks. I had looked over the documentation and it seemed like the scaling algorithm was specified using -option outside of the filter specification, guess I overlooked that it could be set with flags=
[07:45:31] <furq> scale and aresample are documented kind of weirdly on account of them calling out to swscale and swresample
[07:46:24] <tm512> what do you mean at native res exactly, and why? I've got the emulator set to 3x scaling because I want to actually see well
[07:46:46] <furq> i meant 1x scaling but if you're capturing actual playback and not demo playback then that's probably no good
[07:46:49] <tm512> native res on the DS is 256x192 per screen, which is pretty tiny on a 1080p monitor
[07:49:44] <tm512> scaling the emulator output at 2x basically means that the scale to 720p is working with 6x6 pixels which I feel should scale down pretty well. probably resulting in non-square pixels but I much prefer that over a blurry upscale

[23:18:31] <aphysically> whoa lots of subtitle patches on the ML
[23:20:45] <aphysically> seems cool, although I'd like if the video/textsub overlay filter got combined too to avoid unneeded splits in code
[23:20:53] <aphysically> and hopefully the old filters would stick around for a cycle
[23:23:56] *** Trieste_ is now known as Trieste
[23:24:49] <aphysically> when reading the patches it also wasn't clear to me how the video sub overlay is working with regards to scaling - right now you would insert a scale2ref filter typically
