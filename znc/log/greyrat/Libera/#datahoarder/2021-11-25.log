[03:50:34] <sarnold> my laptop is like that, it's only got space for one drive, so that's what it's got, a zpool of one disk
[03:50:54] <rawktucc> I want the zfs bit checking and snapshots, but i dont want to like, have to deal with recovery of a whole pool or shit like that
[03:51:00] <rawktucc> or, issues in terms of "expanding" for more storage
[03:51:35] <rawktucc> sarnold, and like no issues/
[03:52:08] <rawktucc> this will be 4x16TBs each as their own zpool, and one of those drives will hold a snapraid parity file. so if one of the other 3 drives dies, I can rebuild the files on there with the parity file. unless the parity drive dies
[03:52:12] <unfinity> ・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_ø<​ QUAC​K!
[03:52:16] <rawktucc> ,piss
[03:52:17] <sarnold> rawktucc: only a few metadata items are duplicated in this sort of setup, so there's not a whole lot of value to the integrity checking, I don't think..
[03:52:18] <rawktucc> ,bef
[03:52:18] <unfinity> rawktucc you befriended a duck in 5.722 seconds! You have made friends with 2 ducks in #datahoarder.
[03:52:36] <rawktucc> sarnold but each metadata set is independent for the drive though
[03:52:46] <rawktucc> right?
[03:53:20] <sarnold> rawktucc: I don't think zfs gains you anything here. you might as well just go with xfs if you're just going to store one huge file on there.
[03:53:45] *** sm2n_ is now known as sm2n
[03:53:46] <rawktucc> so zfs on 3 drives and xfs on one drive
[03:53:54] <rawktucc> the other 3 will have thousands of files big and small

[04:02:54] <sarnold> the metadata that is *that* important to zfs is stored at least twice; there are four uberblocks on each disk, two at the front, two at the rear..
[04:03:24] <sarnold> I think they're blowing the risks out of proportion there, myself. but people who like zfs tend to like data integrity and availability and would rather not have pools without redundancy

[04:10:55] <sarnold> it'd be a lot easier to just use zfs zraid1 and when a drive needs replacing, replace it.
[04:11:20] <rawktucc> im hoping to use the full capacity of each disk :(
[04:11:31] <breavyn> if you make a jbod, then there is no fixing bit errors, you can identify them, but not fix them
[04:11:56] <rawktucc> I guess I could fix them with snapraid scrub but that's not an active biterror fix thing
[04:12:21] <Myself> I wish there was some automated way to say "okay these blocks, these right here, with bit errors, fetch them from the backup" without having to restore the whole backup
[04:12:29] <rawktucc> oh i see
[04:12:35] <rawktucc> raidz1 is single parity, like snapraid
[04:13:55] <breavyn> you wouldn't need to make 1 disk pools and merge them either. You can add many 1 disk vdevs to a pool, but again, you're asking for dataloss
[04:15:15] <rawktucc> https://ttm.sh/e4p.png oof this is not what im expecting
[04:15:35] <rawktucc> it's 4x16TB drives, with snapraid I'd have 48TB usable and one 16TB as the snapraid parity file. but here I lose 20TB
[04:15:50] <rawktucc> idk what slop space is though
[04:16:22] <breavyn> you lose 1 drive for parity regardless of the raid implemntation
[04:16:28] <rawktucc> yes
[04:16:35] <breavyn> exactly 1 drive, no more or less
[04:16:44] <rawktucc> but I get 4TB more with snapraid, but lose active fs bitchecking
[04:16:48] <rawktucc> bit-checking
[04:17:00] <breavyn> you don't get any more or less, it will be identical
[04:17:19] <sarnold> you could try fiddling the 4k sector size down to 512, but if you've got 4kn drives that'll be horrible news for performance..
[04:17:20] <rawktucc> the calculator says 46TB Usable ignoring slop space. 17TB used for parity
[04:17:27] <rawktucc> hm
[04:18:48] *** Quits: superkuh (~superkuh@user/superkuh) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:20:14] <breavyn> also if you're sweating about the last couple % capacity of the pool, it doesn't matter what you're using, you need more/bigger drives
[04:20:49] <sarnold> yeah, that 20% free space limit is probably the much more important box to check
[04:21:02] <rawktucc> how come?
[04:21:37] <breavyn> COW filesystems don't like riding 100% capacity
[04:21:40] <sarnold> most filesystems get extremely cranky and give pretty poor layouts when you go beyond a certain number.. with zfs, I understand it really does best below 80% utilization
[04:21:49] <rawktucc> :|
[04:21:54] <rawktucc> i kinda wanna fill them all up tbh
[04:21:57] <rawktucc> i dont like wasting space
[04:22:14] <sarnold> yeah.. I just hit 87% on one of mine. sigh.
[04:22:44] <rawktucc> TOSHIBA MG08ACA16TEY Sector Sizes:     512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical
[04:22:50] <rawktucc> so this is 4K?
[04:23:04] <rawktucc> so dont drop to 512b sector size
[04:23:22] <breavyn> 512 drives are basically mythical at this point
[04:23:29] <sarnold> right. that makes sense for that huge of a drive, I don't know if there are any that size that are 512 native or not :(
[04:23:33] <sarnold> dang :/
[04:23:51] <rawktucc> so what about BTRFS then
[04:24:19] <rawktucc> also isn't ext4 COW? i ride like 100% usage on lots of my drives
[04:24:19] <sarnold> stick to mirrors with btrfs
[04:24:21] <breavyn> what about it? it's very similar tech, with similar strengths/weakness
[04:24:33] <breavyn> ext4 is not COW
[04:24:57] <rawktucc> i see
[04:25:44] <rawktucc> sarnold, why btrfs mirrors?
[04:26:06] <breavyn> because it has a really bad track record with anything more complicated
[04:26:11] <sarnold> rawktucc: because their raid5/raid6 stuff is apaprently broken enough that it's not safe
[04:26:20] <rawktucc> https://gist.github.com/darth-veitcher/b84b69873f6cccfc85f2f372e17f58c2
[04:26:23] <rawktucc> what bout this
[04:27:11] <sarnold> hmm, I don't speak the btrfs commands well enough to know what it means
[04:27:22] <breavyn> if you intend to fill the pool to 100%, that would also mean you essentially intend to use the pool readonly, so with zfs you should be good to about 97%
