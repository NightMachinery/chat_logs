[01:10:41] <pe> Oh no.
[01:10:54] <gwozniak> What I saw yesterday in a tech support call with a Makefile (override used with impunity) gave me no confidence
[01:10:57] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: i worked with a fortran codebase that did compile-time option confirguration based on a system like that
[01:11:08] <gwozniak> joy
[01:11:14] <ngoldbaum> all the modules had stubs that different options can override
[01:11:32] <ngoldbaum> so there’s like 50 different versions of each piece of the codebase depending on your setup

[01:13:13] <gwozniak> In this tech support call, they said they were passing these options to the compiler and it was ignoring them.  So we watch them change the Makefile and sure enough, the options aren't even passed.  Turns out they were changing the wrong override (!) in the Makefile
[01:15:03] <gwozniak> I saw, like, 50 override directives in the Makefile
[01:15:16] <gwozniak> override is something you should rarely need

[01:15:22] <gwozniak> Yup
[01:15:40] <gwozniak> "It's the only way we can get the options to work" was a line I heard

[11:27:23] <rb> The term "oop" is traditional to certain VMs that derive from Smalltalk and Self, including the following:

[11:34:52] <rb> this wiki page is amazing
[11:35:52] <rb> but yeah the base + offset pointers might be useful for me too. right now i use a full 8 bytes for map pointers etc.
[11:37:33] <rb> what i'm wondering is how JVM manages primitives while avoiding GC. what i implemented was a "heap.ensureSpaceInEden" method which triggers a GC if not enough space is in eden, and i then refresh the tracked pointers after that call
[11:37:47] <rb> and oh yeah i wonder how JVM does pointer tracking in native code

[21:44:45] <rb> re: article; i write software on my free time as a hobby. i release most of them under Free licenses so everyone, including end-users, can enjoy the same freedoms as the direct users of my software. beyond that, i really don't care what you do with my projects, and i'm not obliged to maintain them for you or fix bugs (buy support :^))). the whole "moral obligation to pay" thing is dumb though.
[21:44:47] <rb> nobody is obliged, morally or otherwise, to pay for software someone released under *checks* the apache v2 license. if you want that to happen you should be using a license that makes you do it (although that would make the software non-Free). when you were releasing the software under such a license you already knew that users of your software are not obligated to pay you; don't get the FOSS

[23:56:57] <deuill> Any Crustaceans here interested in formal logic? I've only recently started dipping my toes, and was suggested Vagueness by Timothy Williamson as a good overview for the sort of thing I'm looking to learn -- I was wondering if any of y'all have delved into the subject!
