[00:20:52] <Camusensei> Ok, I have found two bug in join

[00:21:32] <Camusensei> # export LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8; join <(printf %s\\n foo.bar 'foo -baz' | sort) - <<<'' # differs from the following example
[00:21:34] <shbot> Camusensei: join: /dev/fd/63:2: is not sorted: foo -baz
[00:21:40] <Camusensei> # export LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8; join <(printf %s\\n foo.bar 'foo -baz' | sort) <(:)
[00:21:41] <shbot> Camusensei: no output
[00:22:05] <Camusensei> The first bug is this difference when treating the input as a file or as stdin
[00:22:38] <Camusensei> The second bug is incorrectly detecting the sorting when LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8 (no problem with LC_ALL=C)
[00:24:09] <Camusensei> Should I report it against coreutils?

[00:27:42] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[00:27:48] <earnestly> In the example using <<<, you're adding a newline
[00:27:49] <Camusensei> but join should not use C but en_US as well
[00:27:53] <Camusensei> ah
[00:28:18] <earnestly> No insofar as it might consider something to be sorted according to C's collation rules but not for en_US
[00:28:47] <Camusensei> well, I'd be surprised because I had to use LC_ALL=C join for my input but I'll try again
[00:29:04] <Camusensei> (another input)

[00:32:20] <shbot> Camusensei: no output
[00:33:40] <Camusensei> so I'd expect when using en_US.utf-8 for both join and sort not to have this error with join.

[00:56:36] <geirha> same with tr btw. GNU tr only does single byte characters. While BSD tr support UTF-8
[00:57:25] <earnestly> Camusensei: etags are conventions used in http headers to indicate a resources "state", such as the mtime, an inode, checksum, etc.
[00:57:44] <earnestly> You then store the etag locally, and then check the header and if the etag is the same, skip it
[00:57:59] <Camusensei> Then I know what you meant by etag, but I don't understand why you bring it up in this context
[00:58:20] <earnestly> To avoid downloading files that have already been handled
[00:58:27] <Camusensei> aaaaaaaaah ok
[00:58:37] <earnestly> Since that is the point of etags
[00:59:41] <Camusensei> well, tbh I have no idea. It could probably simplify a lot of our process now that we are downloading from a single location
[01:00:39] <earnestly> aws appears to know about etags
[01:00:41] <Camusensei> but it probably doesn't. Cloud services are not as advanced as one thinks, and some are far far behind

[04:39:52] <pj> emanuele6's earlier example is admittedly far-fetched, but if it contains anything in IFS then it has to be quoted.
[04:40:16] <kurahaupo> earendel: ${var// /%20}
[04:40:48] <kurahaupo> I just set IFS to empty
[04:40:49] <emanuele6> and you probably want -r with the read otherwise 'O\ikK' will count as valid
[04:40:49] <earendel> kurahupo: thank you. and with sed?
[04:41:01] <pj> earendel: that ^^^^, but honestly you probably hsouldn't be using bash to do URL encoding, and if you do you'll need a lot more than just spaces replaced.
[04:41:44] <pj> kurahaupo: oh, I see
[04:41:51] <kurahaupo> earendel: For a URL, space should be translated to "+" if you follow the RFC

[05:06:10] <kurahaupo> Sed's man page is quite explicit that the s command is sCpatternCreplacementCflags and that you can choose C

[05:07:02] <earendel> usually i'd expect the command to be not part of the quoted string. here sed is different.
[05:07:39] <emanuele6> quoted string?
[05:07:39] <earendel> again. an example would have been helpful.
[05:07:44] <emanuele6> # echo anna | sed s/a/b/g
[05:07:45] <shbot> emanuele6: bnnb
[05:07:56] <emanuele6> i don't even understand what you are talking about
[05:07:58] <kurahaupo> But before you get to that part, you should have read the part where it explains that sed takes multiple commands separated by newlines or semicolons and that it runs them all for each input line
[05:09:10] <kurahaupo> earendel: The quoting is because sed uses symbols that would otherwise be shell meta-characters. The same quoting rule applies for EVERY command
[05:10:10] <emanuele6> as you can see, in the case of `sed s/a/b/g', the command works without single quotes too

[05:10:22] <earendel> usually parameters are not part of the payload. and that may be the difference for sed.
[05:11:25] <emanuele6> earendel: sed is a programming language and `s/a/b/g` is inline code
[05:11:29] <earendel> as it parses the payload / usually files? and executes commands accordingly. however thanks.
[05:11:46] <earendel> ah. well. i didn't know that.
[05:11:57] <earendel> awk too?
[05:11:57] <emanuele6> it is similar to running: python -c 'print("hi")'

[05:17:29] <e36freak> yeah

[12:16:08] <Guest9154> hi
[12:16:29] <Guest9154> i've made a script to automatically download an image for me, add watermark for it and upload it to ftp
[12:16:39] <Guest9154> i'm kinda stuck at uploading to ftp server part
[12:16:58] <Guest9154> none of the solutions i've tried works (curl & scp)
[12:17:38] <Guest9154> curl --local-port 22 --user user@host --upload-file "$filename" ftp://ftp.server.com
[12:18:01] <pj> Guest9154: you need to use whatever the target server supports.  sftp is a likely candidate.  I would not recommend plain FTP as it's insecure.
[12:18:07] <Guest9154> can someone provide me with an alterative to this? also, not having to enter my ftp passwd eachtime i'm running it would be ncice
[12:18:27] <Guest9154> @pj i'm looking into sftp right now
[12:18:55] <pj> and sftp uses ssh, so you can use a ssh private/public keypair instead of a password.

[18:40:21] <iconoclasthero> ok, so here's what I want to do and my current general practice:
[18:40:21] <iconoclasthero> I have 4 cores and generally use them to each process one file at a time, i.e., i have not more than 4 parallel processes at a time.
[18:40:21] <iconoclasthero> presently, to accomplish this, I have a guake window open and split it horizontally into 4 windows and just call the script once per window.
[18:41:06] <iconoclasthero> if i could background 4 scripts, i wouldn't need to open 3 additional windows.
[18:44:23] <wwallace> pssh -Ph server list -t 0 -I<./script_on_local_machine &    may be?
[18:45:47] <iconoclasthero> is that for me?

[18:45:53] <meator> wwallace: I don't want to modify any files, I just want to get a list of them. I have a glob that finds files I want and I need to put myfile in it. Let's say I have this: echo * and it returns: a b c d. I want to modify this to get: a myfile b myfile c myfile d myfile.

[20:12:18] <earnestly> Also that sed doesn't "print the include and then edit it", the second subsitution applies to everything
[20:12:50] <kurahaupo> sed -n -i will delete all the lines except the ones that you explicitly "p"
[20:13:04] <earnestly> Yeah, the use of -n here doesn't really make sense
[20:13:15] <kurahaupo> (but arghhhh, there are better options)
[20:13:19] <earnestly> Since the second sed command won't apply to the printed pattern space
[20:13:24] <earnestly> kurahaupo: There are?
[20:13:32] <earnestly> kurahaupo: I asked #c, and they have nothing
[20:13:40] <earnestly> (well nothing specifically for this)
[20:13:59] <captainchris> emanuel i need to modify just #include directive
[20:14:02] <earnestly> captainchris: (Don't use ../../ in include directives, use -I instead)
[20:14:16] <kurahaupo> frankly this sort of task is better suited to using a text editor with a built in macro capability
[20:15:06] <kurahaupo> eg vim, emacs
[20:15:09] <earnestly> Eh
[20:15:29] <earnestly> You're not gaining much over sed by doing that.  In fact you could then use ed/ex and be done with it
[20:15:39] <earnestly> tbh, that might be better anyway
[20:15:50] <emanuele6> captainchris: sed -n sedcode -e othersedcode is not valid...
[20:15:54] <kurahaupo> yes or ed/ex
[20:16:13] <captainchris> -I is not supported by busybox sed
[20:16:40] <emanuele6> # <<< $'aaaaa\nbbbb' sed -n s/a/cc/p -e s/b/dd/p # captainchris
[20:16:41] <shbot> emanuele6: sed: can't read s/a/cc/p: No such file or directory
[20:16:47] <earnestly> captainchris: -I is not a sed flags, it's a cc flag
[20:16:48] <emanuele6> # <<< $'aaaaa\nbbbb' sed -n -e s/a/cc/p -e s/b/dd/p # captainchris
[20:16:49] <shbot> emanuele6: ccaaaa
[20:16:49] <shbot> emanuele6: ddbbb
[20:16:53] <earnestly> emanuele6: Use ex/ed
[20:17:02] <kurahaupo> Who cares about busybox? It's so broken in so many ways that's is not worth the effort to support
[20:17:16] <emanuele6> earnestly: yes, i would ever use `sed -i' :)

[20:19:18] <earnestly> printf '%s\n' '/#include.*plist.h/' c '#include "../../libplist.h"' . wq | ex -s file
[20:19:21] <captainchris> do i use it with sed
[20:20:11] <earnestly> busybox also lacks ex, heh.  But the same command will work with ed, which it has
[20:20:28] <earnestly> It just doesn't have -s because busybox is garbage
[20:20:41] <earnestly> (The author has long since gone to make toybox which is a lot better)
[20:22:04] <earnestly> lol busybox's ed doesn't even implement Q
[20:22:41] <kurahaupo> captainchris: sed-i has multiple problems, even when it "works"; not least, it writes new file and renames it to replace the original even if nothing in the file changes. So it changes the timestamp and inode number, takes ownership of the file, breaks other hard links, …
[20:22:45] <earnestly> Anyway, you can chain commands with print like this (or use a heredoc).  If you want to print the line you're changing, you can use p before c, etc.
[20:23:54] <kurahaupo> On the plus side, the atomic rename means the content change is consistent
[20:24:11] <captainchris> I didn't think that is so hard

[20:44:59] <kurahaupo> earnestly: since ex is simply an operating mode of vi, that will depend which version of vi you have installed
