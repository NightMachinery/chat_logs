[03:34:42] <sheetjs> OhTheCode: there are separate rules
[03:34:49] <sheetjs> if both are strings, it does a string comparison

[11:54:23] <verwirrt> Rookie question: Is there a smarter way to have a variable declared inside an if statement scoped so that I can access it outside the if statement? At the moment I just declare it above the if statement then define it in the if body.
[11:55:13] <verwirrt> The downside to this is I can't create a const variable this way (plus it looks messy/superfluous to me)
[11:55:43] <Decker> that's it
[11:55:45] <silly> no, there is no other way
[11:56:18] <verwirrt> ok, thanks :)
[11:56:54] <verwirrt> related(ish) question, is use of 'var' always discouraged now that we have let and const?
[11:57:02] <silly> yes
[11:57:17] <verwirrt> Great, cheers!
[11:57:39] <silly> maybe, instead of your if, you can use a ternary? or ||/&&?

[12:08:56] <verwirrt> My IDE keep correcting things to that, so I had to look it up :)
[12:09:20] <verwirrt> Javascript sure has a lot of operators compared to other languages I've worked with
[12:10:17] <silly> yeah it has changed massively since 2016
[12:10:55] <silly> 2015...
[12:12:38] <silly> verwirrt, you'd also need babel if you want to support old browsers
[12:13:27] <verwirrt> One of the obstacles so far has definitely been figuring out what is 'modern' and what is older practices
[12:14:04] <verwirrt> I'm actually developing an Electron app as a front end to some command line tools, so I don't think I need to worry too much about different browsers?
[12:14:11] <verwirrt> Since everything is chrome
[12:14:34] <silly> babel is best used in a build step with a bundler like webpack, rollup, parcel
[12:14:42] <silly> and install eslint while you're at it

[12:15:22] <silly> with electron you don't have to worry much
[12:16:17] <silly> for an electron react app you would still use a bundler
[12:16:39] <verwirrt> I'm using an electron boiler plate which includes webpack, eslint and babel, but I don't have a strong understanding of what each does
[12:16:58] <silly> and maybe still babel, so you can use even newer syntax
[12:17:16] <verwirrt> There's a lot to learn, but I'm focusing on trying to get a quick prototype of to prove to myself that I can do it and it will work ;)
[12:17:35] <silly> babel is a transpiler, webpack a bundler and eslint is the linting tool
[12:17:37] <verwirrt> I'm used to C++, so Javascript is a big change for me
[12:17:46] <silly> what's your ide?
[12:17:55] <parv> verwirrt, You should see Raku, re: Javascript sure has a lot of operators ...
[12:18:20] <verwirrt> I vaguely get babel and eslint, but I'm not really sure what webpack actually *does*. It's like a compiler for building everything into an easy to deploy bundle?
[12:18:25] <verwirrt> I'm using VSCode
[12:18:30] <silly> there's probably an eslint plugin for your ide
[12:19:09] <silly> webpack builds one big js file from your many *.js source files
[12:19:14] <Decker> yes that's what webpack does (also browserify, rollup, ...)

[12:22:04] <silly> you can right click marked code and get help per issue
[12:23:09] <silly> and you can modify eslint rules to your liking
[12:23:46] <verwirrt> I just checked and it looks like I disabled eslint on vscode! I guess I was annoyed by all the red (terrible, terrible practice, I know). I suppose I only meant it to be temporary

[12:26:18] <verwirrt> I'm not sure. I turned it back on and approx 2/3 of my lines have suggestions!
[12:26:25] <theskillwithin> should behave as the .eslint config says for the project
[12:26:26] <silly> that's good
[12:26:53] <theskillwithin> bonus points if you can do eslint wth prettier configs in porject

[12:28:12] <verwirrt> Now I'm looking at them again, I think it's the prettier 'errors' that were annoying me. It's very specific about how it wants code formatted and I'm used to reading code formatted differently
[12:28:26] <verwirrt> I'll see if I can figure out how to keep eslint without prettier
[12:28:33] <silly> yeah i don't like prettier too
[12:28:35] <verwirrt> Or just learn new habits ;)
[12:28:53] <theskillwithin> you can config prettier
[12:29:20] <silly> oh, i thought it was a fixed rule set
[12:29:48] <theskillwithin> it might seem odd at first,  but consistency really helps when you look at the code.  and tool to auto do that
[12:30:07] <silly> i never looked much into it, so i still don't see the benefits if you already have eslint rules
[12:31:26] <theskillwithin> also well different people haz different ways of formatting.  but they haz dat .prettierrc file in their repo,  i just write code how im used to and formats to that project

[15:30:25] <tar_xvf> username:password@ is very oldschool, i would suggest you think about something like making a 32 or 64 character long random string and pass that in the path, so that when that link gets clicked it gets "linked" with the user you were intending to log in, than use cookies

[15:33:30] <tar_xvf> thanks hassoon
[15:33:54] <tar_xvf> i just thought, you could use a hashed password in username:password@ format too
[15:35:12] <hassoon> tar_xvf: since he can use a url composed of the raw string values of username/password, he can navigate to a user-specific logged-in environment, relying on cookies to make sure the user has authenticated before imo
[15:35:16] <hassoon> cookies or whatever
[15:35:33] <tar_xvf> i admit i am not familiar with what auth urls are or if there is any special significance but if it's something like when you request to change your password and you are sent an email with a link which is 256 characters long for example, maybe try something like that
[15:36:26] <tar_xvf> hassoon: that's a good idea. when i said oldschool what i meant was i thought having the password in plaintext form could be a security concern, although if it authenticates in another way that may not be a problem
[15:37:23] <hassoon> tar_xvf: the man stated that he can simply use http://username:password@website.com to navigate to a logged-in-user's environment..go figure
