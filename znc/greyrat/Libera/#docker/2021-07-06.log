[01:09:13] <Lutin> artok no that sucks
[01:09:36] <artok> where that came from?
[01:09:49] <Lutin> artok there were even more... don't know!
[01:10:34] <Lutin> artok swarm leave and reboot helps
[01:11:23] <Lutin> in the current, tho working setup I get this on a joiner: Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = The swarm does not have a leader. It's possible that too few managers are online. Make sure more than half of the managers are online.
[01:11:49] <Lutin> when I resart the first leader all is fine but I think it messes up
[01:18:47] <Lutin> artok mhh weird now a this with a new init: Error response from daemon: must specify a listening address because the address to advertise is not recognized as a system address, and a system's IP address to use could not be uniquely identified. Wh0t?

[17:58:14] <cart_man> Hi everyone. If I dont create Mounts for log files being written inside the container will the runtime generated logs then be written to a location in RAM instead of to some Disc mount?
[17:59:30] <cart_man> It seems to me that when I dont give my pods mounts they grow considerably in RAM usage when writing files to them.
[18:01:46] *** Joins: Atum_ (~IRC@user/atum/x-2392232)
[18:01:50] <ada_> cart_man: it depends on how your app is written; the best practice is to emit logs to stdout and stderr and docker will consume them
[18:02:11] <ada_> cart_man: then the docker engine sends them to whatever log driver is configured for that container; by default they're stored on disk and you can read them with "docker logs $container"
[18:02:17] <cart_man> ada_: Well these files are generated as the process continues ...like kafka for instance 
[18:02:30] <ada_> cart_man: how the messages are generated is irrelevant
[18:02:37] <ada_> cart_man: if they are emitted to stdout and stderr then docker will consume them
[18:03:01] <ada_> cart_man: if they are not emitted to stdout and stderr, then ... you'll have to do something if you want to get them out of the container, such as mounting a volume 
[18:03:14] <cart_man> ada_: No they are stored in files as part of the process so they wont be emitted anywhere.. Sorry I should reprhase that its not only Log files
[18:03:33] <cart_man> ada_: Ok so that could be why the container keeps on consuming ram then?
[18:04:11] <ada_> cart_man: that might be a reason
[18:04:16] <ada_> I couldn't say that it IS THE reason
[18:05:20] <Lutin> YES! Swarm runs internall :D
[18:05:21] <ada_> there is a way to mount a ramdisk 
[18:05:24] <Lutin> *internally!
[18:05:34] <ada_> cart_man: you can mount a volume of type=tmpfs and that will be backed by RAM instead of block storage

[19:13:10] <kiwikiwik> Common advice: 'Your Dockerfile should always drop root privileges using the `USER` directive.' Me: 'I can't write to a bind-mount from inside the container because of permission mismatch. Any tricks? It only works when i use the root user'
[19:14:38] <programmerq> if you want to use a bind mount, then you'll need to make sure the numeric uid/gid in the container has write permissions to the bind mount in question.
[19:19:02] <Byteflux> You can also just use a volume if there's no strong requirement for persistence to be done through a bind mount. Permissions is one of the reasons a volume may be preferable.
[19:19:13] <kiwikiwik> for local development bind mounts are easier to manage than volumes or?
[19:19:46] <kiwikiwik> for example when you bind mount a git repo
[19:20:41] *** Joins: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot)
[19:21:30] <Byteflux> Yeah bind mount is probably more convenient for development

[19:22:23] <programmerq> for local dev, just match the uid/gid in the container to the uid/gid on the host. as long as the numeric uid matches, you're good.
[19:22:47] <Byteflux> You mention mounting a git repo, for production you'd likely want to bundle the app itself into the image and only mount volumes for things that need persisting like data/logs.
[19:23:21] <kiwikiwik> when i run `id` outside and inside the container i get 1000
[19:23:39] <kiwikiwik> yeah i read volumes are better for production
[19:25:23] <Byteflux> You can build your dev image to use uid 1000 / gid 1000

[19:47:47] <ada_> Lutin: what does "doesn't work" mean?
[19:47:57] <ada_> did you check the device info in the container? are you only looking at inspect?

[19:48:12] <programmerq> seems to work to me
[19:48:14] <Lutin> listen, wait!
[19:48:36] <Lutin> if you set MTU on a network you also need to specify it on the container... otherwise it doesn't work...
