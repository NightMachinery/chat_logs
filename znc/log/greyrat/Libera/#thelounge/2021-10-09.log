[10:52:12] <bookworm> not that I know, just for the love of god, don't think animating it is a good idea üôÉ anything that requires clicking I'm fine with
[10:52:24] <johncs> animating?
[10:52:27] <johncs> oh like a marquee?

[10:54:50] <johncs> but they're decorative, not functional
[10:55:18] <bookworm> nothing on a page should move in my opinion ;) just distracts from the text
[10:55:30] <bookworm> blinking said text though is perfectly fine :P
[10:56:33] <Activ8> please no lol keep to static content üòÑ
[10:56:34] <johncs> lol are you sure you're not secretly a weechat user?
[10:57:48] <johncs> I'm not quite sure what I'll come up with design-wise, need to play with it. But will be some form of click/tap-to-expand
[10:57:54] <Activ8> <marquee>This text moves</marquee> üòÑ
[10:58:07] <bookworm> sounds good
[11:01:11] <johncs> also a bit more meta... since the project looks like it's on a bit of a skeleton crew, if I do put out work on bigger changes like reaction, will ya'll feel comfortable merging it in?
[11:01:29] <johncs> I saw the mention of "all changes should be reviewed by two maintainers" but that list looks outdated maybe
[11:01:44] <bookworm> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we have one active maintainer with the commit bit
[11:01:50] <bookworm> I can't speak for him
[11:02:31] <bookworm> I can test your feature, look at the code (to a certain extent) and give feedback that way. I certainly do appreciate the effort
[11:02:36] <johncs> M-axLeiter?
[11:02:40] <bookworm> jep
[11:02:47] <johncs> MaxLeiter, what do you think?
[11:03:30] <bookworm> (US TZ, probably asleep)
[11:03:56] <johncs> No worries, hopefully they'll notice the ping at some point tomorrow. I can bug them midday tomorrow otherwise
[11:06:01] <bookworm> to be fair, while there's lots of stuff that could be done, TL is also working fine as is. So it's not like the house is on fire if the development is slow
[11:07:09] <bookworm> thankfully IRC doesn't move that fast, as long as libera doesn't support the fancy ircv3 features it also doesn't make too much sense implementing them considering they are by far the largest net
[11:07:33] <johncs> totes, I'm not worried about the product. just worried about putting in dev time that doesn't end up getting into the project
[11:07:38] <bookworm> chat history would be nice, but libera explicitly doesn't want that
[11:07:51] <bookworm> understandable
