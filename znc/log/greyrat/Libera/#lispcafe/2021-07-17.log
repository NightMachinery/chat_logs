[03:40:19] <aeth> check your activity feed... for me, 3/38 friends have "Steam Deck Deposit"
[03:40:27] <aeth> since it shows up as an owned game
[03:40:55] <aeth> another person with 10x as many friends had about 10%, too
[03:41:15] <Gnuxie> yeah but these are already PC gamers and valve customers 
[03:41:30] <Gnuxie> they're probably selling these at a loss 
[03:41:35] <Gnuxie> there's no value in selling to these people 
[03:42:10] <aeth> 22,917,752 24-hour peak for concurrent users. https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/
[03:42:36] <aeth> so if they could actually sell to 10% of active-at-peak-hours Steam users, that's a lot of sales
[03:43:15] <Gnuxie> but as i said, they're doing this in the end to sell more games through steam, to people who weren't going to be buying them anyways

[05:10:47] <aeth> yes
[05:29:25] <hayley> Bad idea for attempting to "lock" a bus on a shared bus system: have a voltage divider between outputs of each node, such that for a N-node machine each chip adds 1/N of the voltage. Have an analog input on each read the voltage and ensure that it is only held at that 1/N voltage. Obviously this only scales to the precision of your ADC, hence why it is a bad idea.
[05:33:44] <hayley> Oh, and external devices on that bus need to have a ADC so that they don't collide.

[05:43:13] <hayley> Chaosnet just watches to make sure the bus is low for a while before writing, which could work. If we expect to not write frequently, we could just "idle" for 10ms or so and watch for no one to write to the bus, which *should* work if every chip enters such a loop.
[05:43:57] <hayley> n.b. it also has an active carrier sense but I can't think of how to implement that with a hardware UART (as we don't really know the shape of what we are signalling without some other differential hardware or something), so this hack should suffice.

[07:14:32] <gilberth> hayley: Do you want a real bus spanning some distance with no common ground? Then go RS485. Rock solid even in harsh environments. For a transceiver look here <https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX1487-MAX491.pdf> Otherwise just go OC. Make it a bus and terminate at the ends.
[07:21:22] <gilberth> Use an UART to drive those. Verify that you receive what you send, that is your collision detection. For detecting that the bus is idle, just let a timer run off the last time you received sth. Or poll the bus for mark. You could also generate a bus idle/busy signal by a diode and an RC and a Schmitt-trigger. (You don't want to drive digital inputs from actually analog signals, they don't like it, when being half-way between what ever is
[07:23:17] <gilberth> You may also route the idle signal to an interrupt :)

[10:20:23] <hayley> gilberth: Seems everyone just does I2C using some master device and every other chip is a slave. But then you have to poll which, while workable, doesn't sit right with me.
[10:22:29] <hayley> At least the I2C hardware only interrupts you for your own messages.
[10:22:30] <gilberth> hayley: You could also XOR your RX and TX to have a combined busy/collision signal, filter it a bit, and you're fine. <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/mcubus.png> Would work with OC too. I won't go I2C, I hate that, and rather use the trusty UART. And once you use interrupts you don't have to poll.
[10:22:52] <hayley> Right and right.
[10:23:34] <gilberth> Some UARTS even have auto-RTS/CTS you could play with :-)
[10:25:22] <gilberth> hayley: You mean own messages = only the messages addressed at you?
[10:25:31] <hayley> Right.
[10:26:14] <hayley> But OTOH I would find a useless P2P bus machine more interesting than a useless master-slave bus machine. Then you get to learn actors by force.
[10:26:20] <gilberth> Well, an interrupt per message flowing by could be cheap. You only would need to read the first octet for some address.
[10:27:30] <gilberth> With ARM MCUs the FIQs are really fast. You have registers for your own and don't need to save/restore any context.
[10:27:34] <hayley> With UART hardware we have to kill off the buffer/packet, but sure.
[10:27:59] <gilberth> UARTs have FIFOs.
[10:29:23] <hayley> Funny enough that the cheapest ARM I can find is a damn RP2040, i.e. Pi Pico chip. That price doesn't include your EEPROM/flash but it comes up first on product lists.
[10:30:02] <hayley> https://au.element14.com/raspberry-pi/rp2040ct/mcu-32bit-133mhz-qfn-56/dp/3766082 90 Euro cents(?) per chip.
[10:30:09] <gilberth> You could pace. Break for one or two octet times, bus becomes busy, which you detect with the XOR, read the one header octet, and when not for you, ignore until the whole packet is over.
[10:31:28] <hayley> Though the problem really is that at this scale, it is too large to be "small", and too small to be practical.

[10:32:27] <hayley> Netfarm to an extent also had the same problem, until I did my own statistics and found it wasn't that large. But you get the idea.
[10:32:58] <gilberth> How many MCUs do you want to connect?
[10:33:53] <hayley> One orders RP2040s in tens...
[10:35:27] <hayley> Hm, the Pico uses a 12MHz oscillator but the chip runs at 133MHz. Each chip would be an independent unit with a separate clock and flash, only sharing the common I2C/UART/idk bus though.
[10:35:43] <gilberth> Anyhow. Suppose a packet is 128B and the bus is at 1MBps, then it's not even 1,000 packets per second. One interrupt each 1ms is very feasible.
[10:36:39] <hayley> IIRC the flash quad-SPI bus runs at like 30MHz though, and that would be the fastest signal on the PCB.
[10:36:45] * gilberth used to have an 32kHz interrupt on a 60MHz device.
[10:40:30] <gilberth> The design would pretty much depend upon whether all is on one PCB with a shared ground or not.
[10:42:40] <hayley> Still, I don't have a use for a machine other than "it looks kinda neat" but then it doesn't look neat at all honestly.
[10:43:09] <hayley> World's worst Connection Machine?
[10:43:40] <gilberth> It used routed communication, not a bus.
[10:44:54] <hayley> Yes.
[10:44:58] <gilberth> Makes sense as a SIMD machine. Each node had fixed number of connections to its neighbors, all would be clocked through bit-wise.

[11:01:53] <gilberth> I skimmed the RP2040 datasheet and would still use the UART. I2C isn't faster on that chip and the my proposed bus is two-wire. Either DATA and GND, or as in RS485 just differential.
[11:03:12] <gilberth> Or go with SPI when you could spend the clock. That sure is faster.
