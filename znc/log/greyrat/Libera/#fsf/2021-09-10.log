[16:18:54] <Anedroid> For me one of the most difficult things about free software is not migrating to free software. It's a teaching others, and explaining why they should use free software, what's wrong with Microsoft Windows...
[16:21:37] <Anedroid> In most cases they tell me that they're not advanced users and they don't need nothing better
[16:22:32] <seabass_> yeah, that can be a hard thing to explain
[16:22:55] <seabass_> free software is good insurance against the software producer doing something you don't like
[16:25:07] *** wowaname is now known as opal
[16:25:57] <seabass_> I personally don't like to say that Microsoft Windows is bad, because most bad things can be justified
[16:26:33] <seabass_> but I do like to tell everyone how awesome it is to have a package manager where you're allowed to use everything without restriction!
[16:26:53] <seabass_> I think that's the instant wow-factor for msot people moving to a free operating system

[16:27:32] <opal> yeah focus on the features
[16:27:54] <Anedroid> Features?
[16:27:54] <opal> also "i dont need to reboot after every single upgrade or to keep my system running well"
[16:28:02] <Anedroid> Like in open source?
[16:28:12] <opal> in foss alternatives to proprietary software
[16:28:20] <opal> plenty of things linux can do better than windows
[16:28:40] <Anedroid> *linux is just a kernel
[16:28:47] <seabass_> also depending on how much they're interested in computers, you can recommend things like KDE that allow you to customise the look and feel of the computer
[16:28:50] <opal> my point stands
[16:28:56] <opal> even linux kernel is better than nt
[16:29:02] <opal> especially with in-tree drivers
[16:29:06] <seabass_> it's nigh on impossible to theme Windows properly
[16:29:17] <opal> yeah i tried back in the day
[16:29:20] <seabass_> opal, much, much better, IMHO
[16:29:27] <opal> i used an alternative shell
[16:29:37] <opal> what is it called, blackbox or something
[16:29:56] <seabass_> opal: yeah, I tried that too! It was very glitchy; KDE or Xfce just blows it away in terms of customising
[16:30:29] <opal> hm i used it fine on windows 7 but maybe i used it before/after it had bugs, or i didnt use features that had bugs
[16:30:35] <seabass_> although I admit I only really tried KDE yesterday; I've been more of a GTK person up to now
[16:30:46] <opal> i use bspwm
[16:30:53] <opal> no login manager, no desktop environment
[16:30:53] <seabass_> yup, likewise
[16:31:01] <seabass_> I do use a login manager though
[16:31:12] <opal> requires running X as root which i dont like
[16:31:15] <opal> for a multi-user system its fine
[16:31:31] <seabass_> I don't know enough about X security to know what to do
[16:31:33] <opal> for a single-user system? eh too much complexity
[16:31:53] <opal> also i have routinely wanted to do things in a tty before booting into a graphical session
[16:32:02] <opal> so having the choice not to `exec startx` right away is nice
[16:32:24] <seabass_> I always have a tty running at the same time anyway
[16:32:39] <seabass_> so in case my computer starts to freeze, I can kill the program quickly
[16:32:49] <opal> sysrq+f does that
[16:32:53] <opal> runs the oom reaper
[16:33:02] <seabass_> ah, Fedora has disabled that by default
[16:33:05] <opal> ouch
[16:33:16] <seabass_> yeah, something about security for laptop users
[16:33:23] <seabass_> because you can turn off the laptop without a password
[16:33:29] <opal> i mostly see sysrq as a security issue with headless servers
[16:33:31] <opal> not for desktops
[16:33:37] <seabass_> (apparently taking out the battery doesn't count lol)
[16:33:42] <opal> yeah lmao i was about to say
[16:33:53] <opal> turning off power is a DoS attack at worst and it doesnt really matter
[16:34:14] <seabass_> with full disk encryption it's probably more secure at rest anyway
[16:34:21] <opal> speaking of, i've been using xsecurelock for a while now, moved from i3lock
[16:34:42] <seabass_> got to go, sorry
[16:34:43] <opal> if you want, you can kill your x session if xsecurelock exits unsuccessfully (like if it crashes)
[16:34:45] <opal> cya
[16:34:50] <seabass_> bye :)

[16:36:55] <opal> back before i knew what free software was, my aunt used firefox, i saw it, i was like "hey this runs faster than IE, i should use it"
[16:37:21] <opal> glory days of firefox 3.x
[16:37:27] <opal> i feel old
[16:37:39] <clever> in my case, i'm focusing on the rpi open firmware for a number of reasons
[16:37:39] <Anedroid> Now Firefox runs faster than Chrome
[16:37:49] <opal> it sure builds faster than chrome
[16:38:03] <clever> https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1618
[16:38:30] <clever> for example, there is a bug in the official firmware, a bisect reveals it has been broken since october of 2020
[16:38:45] <clever> ive reported the bug 10 days ago, and there has been zero feedback
[16:39:05] <clever> if the firmware was open, i would have fixed it already by now

[20:46:36] <goneall> Thanks.  Can I assume that any license which is red is considered non-free?

[20:47:13] <monkwitdafunk> Hello everybody. Thank you for the attendance to the free software directory meeting
[20:47:18] <donald> goneall: yup, that's the color coding scheme we made
[20:47:22] <donald> monkwitdafunk: hello!
[20:48:25] <monkwitdafunk> Donald, i do not have the ability to study code for now until my endocrinologist teaches me how to compile androidAPS on android
[20:48:31] <goneall> @donald Thanks - that's my most urgent question.  Now one bigger question, there is a utility that scrapes the FSF website and generates data used for the SPDX project page.  Would it make sense to have this project maintained in FSF rather than in the SPDX repo?
[20:49:10] *** Joins: user9 (~ZZZZZ@gateway/tor-sasl/zzzzz)
[20:49:29] <monkwitdafunk> androidAPS is turning a continuous glucose monitor,  and insulin pump, to work as one unit rather than 2 seperate
[20:49:48] <goneall> Logic for having FSF maintain it is that it contains data on which FSF licenses are free and not free.  Seems like that data should be owned inside FSF, so any changes would change the utility.  Don't need to answer that in this session, but just something to think about.
[20:50:17] <monkwitdafunk> It is called a closed loop insulin pump, aka artificial pancreas or bionic pancreas. #cyabetes #thekinetix
[20:50:27] <donald> goneall: I remember having an email thread about that question previously but can't recall the outcome
[20:53:13] <goneall> @donald I also recall discussing it a couple years ago, but I don't think there was a conclusion.  The person who originally wrote the utility no longer supports it so I've picked it up along with one other volunteer.  We're considering moving the utility under SPDX, but it probably make more sense to move it under FSF.  Could be part of the SPDX
[20:53:13] <goneall> project.
[20:54:03] <donald> goneall: right, i was just looking at the thread and there didn't seem to be an outcome
[21:00:18] <goneall> @donald If we maintained the utility in SPDX, would there be any concerns by FSF using the SPDX Github repo to collaborate on any changes to the utility?  For example, if someone claimed the tool didn't generate the right FSF Free flag, I would want someone from FSF to confirm before making the change.
[21:01:00] <iShareFreedom> welcome goneall
[21:01:41] <goneall> @donald if we maintained it in an FSF repo, I can help keep the SPDX data in sync.  We would need some infrastructure to publish the generated .json file
[21:01:51] <donald> goneall: we have to interface with github from time to time (at these meetings for example), but we really don't recommend people use github https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html#GitHub

[21:09:41] <goneall> donald: Interesting read on the Github recommendation.  We've been working with Github for a number of years helping them improve licensing - still a ways to go, but much better than they were a few years ago IMHO.
[21:12:53] <goneall> donald: As long as FSF is willing to contribute/review/participate on the SPDX Github site, I can move over the utility to SPDX.  In my opinion, it would be better at FSF since the utility is mostly about FSF data on licenses - but I'm OK and will help support it either way.

[21:21:48] <donald> kuber: for adding new entries, I don't think we have a list
[21:22:16] <donald> kuber: but the directory only has 16000 entries, so most free software is not already listed
[21:22:53] <donald> kuber: I guess actually you could just go from the package listing on any free distro
[21:23:14] <donald> kuber: there was a project to import information from package listings, but getting the script to work was complicated
[21:23:24] <kuber> so, we have to verify these 16000 entries and submit the short-listed ones for review
[21:23:36] <donald> kuber: but that's probably a good place to look if you don't have any particular packages you want to add
