[22:46:59] <Lvl4Sword> SymbioticFemale, I experienced being k-lined because of being an IRCCloud user
[22:47:15] *** Joins: srikavin (~srikavin@user/srikavin)
[22:47:47] <Lvl4Sword> Which is weird, because I could connect to the network and yet couldn't join or pm anyone. Had to join on a non-IRCCloud IP just to join #freenode to find out what was going on
[22:48:16] <Lvl4Sword> It essentially boiled down to "People abuse free services all the time", which isn't an IRCCloud specific issue at all. So.. kind of weird.

[23:07:08] <synaps3> how to secure from 0days

[23:07:33] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@106.201.113.95) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[23:08:11] <calmclam> no
[23:08:34] <mats1> a dowsing rod
[23:08:50] <mats1> i hear you can find ieds with them too
[23:08:59] <synaps3> dowsing rod ?
[23:09:15] <calmclam> i hear humvees have the highest ied detection rate
[23:10:05] <mats1> i thought free irccloud users had a different mask
[23:10:29] <piou> synaps3: That's where it's important to limit your attack surface as much as possible. If a component of your system has a zero day you can't do anything to prevent it, but if that system isn't exposed to anyone then it won't be exploited.
[23:11:12] <lts-> https://github.com/Tripwire/tripwire-open-source
[23:11:26] <lts-> That's one way to detect anomalies
[23:11:35] <piou> synaps3: so identify unused services and remove them, tighten the configuration to what you need and only that, identify open ports and close them, put a firewall to restrict things more
[23:12:37] <mats1> oh, theres tweets from irccloud about the new freenode mgmt, that explains it
[23:12:51] <piou> When you see people going on and on about security in depth and securing things that don't seem to be unsafe in the first place, that's why it's done. Now it can be taken to a bad extreme, but that remains the best strategy.
[23:13:20] <synaps3> i was thinking about somehow detecting it by process behaviour
[23:13:30] <synaps3> if it stands out from "regular" usage
[23:13:39] <synaps3> or like using stuff it didn't use before
[23:13:56] <piou> synaps3: some tools try to do that. It's never worked well and it can't really. You'll have false positives and false negatives.

[23:14:40] <piou> I'm not saying it's necessarily useless, but that definitely wouldn't be my first choice, I would put that in addition to everything else down the line
[23:14:48] <synaps3> but if you get notified of some abnormal behaviour won't you be able to spot if it is 0day
[23:15:05] <calmclam> no
[23:15:06] <piou> 0day don't necessarily include strange behaviour, far from it
[23:15:07] <synaps3> or just some regular abnormal stuff
[23:15:09] *** Joins: catman (~catman@user/catman370)
[23:15:13] <synaps3> piou, fair
[23:15:20] <piou> also just because something is rare doesn't mean it's illegitimate
[23:15:23] <synaps3> i didn't consider that they would actually hide really well
[23:15:37] <piou> you'll find that you routinely do many rare things
[23:16:13] <piou> It's not even about hiding well, sometimes the vulnerability is just so big that you don't need to do anything strange to exploit it, and those are the most likely to be exploited too
[23:17:37] *** Joins: nnn0 (~nnn0@220.250.164.82.customer.cdi.no)
[23:18:17] <piou> Put it that way: if you want to accurately detect malicious behaviour then you must 1) identify all possible malicious behaviour, 2) identify a set of specific characteristics that match these malicious behaviour 3) make sure that no legitimate behaviour is also matched. That's just not going to happen in the general case. Some AV try to identify specific behaviours, and it can be useful, but
[23:18:23] <piou> that's certainly no silver bullet.
[23:20:48] <piou> synaps3: in short, antiviruses have tried to do that for about 15 years now. Almost all modern antiviruses include a dynamic threat recognition. Long story short: we still have as many malwares and 0days.
[23:26:01] <`Tim> synaps3: mandatory access control systems like selinux, apparmor, tomoyo and similar can help to limit the damage done by specific processes that were compromised
[23:26:29] <`Tim> it won't actually stop them being compromised and abused within what they were allowed to do though
