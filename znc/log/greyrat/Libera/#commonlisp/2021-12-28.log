[02:00:18] <mfiano> VincentVega: I haven't really considered it, and I'm not sure it would be a good idea, as the numerator/denominator could end up very large and thus be consed as a bignum for all the intermediate calculations in a chain of operations.
[02:01:23] <mfiano> Plus, GPU's expect floating point arrays, particularly composed of single-floats, since double-floats are a serious performance trap for GPU calculations.

[02:07:15] <madnificent> I'm seeing some behaviour I don't grok.  I have a parameter containing a hash-table.  I create a bunch of scanners using #'cl-ppcre:create-scanner for later use at runtime and I try to store them in that hash-table.  When doing so, I'm exhausting the heap.  It's a dolist with a (setf gethash).  How would this land on the heap?
[02:08:01] <hayley> The hash table is allowed to resize. And CL-PPCRE creates a chain of closures which allocates.
[02:09:59] <madnificent> hayley: The heap contains all closures and I'm exhausting space for any function definition?
[02:10:49] <madnificent> These are fixed, so if I could define them another way, that'd work too.
[02:10:50] <hayley> "the heap" being all memory Lisp is allowed to use for storing objects?
[02:11:00] <mfiano> You can use (room t) to see the breakdown of dynamic space usage by type on SBCL at least.
[02:11:19] <mfiano> and the default heap size is very low on SBCL at least
[02:11:33] <madnificent> mfiano: good point
[02:11:55] <hayley> You are aware that April fool's day is in April?
[02:12:34] <mfiano> Note that, even specifying a heap size of all of your RAM, that isn't going to be allocated unless it needs it. I typically use 3/4 or so
[02:12:42] <mfiano> (SBCL that is)
[02:12:43] <White_Flame> hayley: no it's not, that's just an april fool's joke
[02:12:54] <hayley> :<
[02:14:34] <madnificent> Somewhat before creating too many scanners, I'm at 500Mb dynamic space.  Almost all of that are simple-array-fixnum objects (only 74 of them?)
[02:15:31] <hayley> What kinds of REs are you compiling?
[02:16:43] <madnificent> hayley: I first compile a bunch of more complex ones (everything is fine there though).  It starts failing when creating many case-insensitive word matches, basically.
[02:18:07] <madnificent> okay.  Let's read the docs for *use-bmh-matchers* again and for (setf *optimize-char-classes* :charmap).  Disabling those two makes sbcl happy.
[02:19:28] <madnificent> Well, *use-bmh-matchers* kind-of says it: use the (fast but large) Boyer-Moore-Horspool matchers.
[02:20:18] <madnificent> Still confused as to why it crashes with under 700Mb of used space.
[02:20:18] <hayley> Ah yeah, those would give you large fixnum tables.
[02:21:14] <madnificent> Oh right, staring at the numbers again, I must have overlooked that.  That's 971Mb of simple-array-fixnum content.
[02:21:32] <madnificent> Thank you all for the help.  Glad to be seeing some lisp again.
[02:24:14] <mfiano> Sure enjoy, and yeah definitely bump up your heap size if you have more than 2G of RAM or so :)
[02:24:49] <madnificent> Ah, for the scrollback: we're running these things on machines with 256Gb of ram.  There's some wiggle room for sure :P
[02:25:21] <hayley> gigabits?
[02:25:23] <mfiano> Well 256Gb is only 32G :P

[02:26:25] <mfiano> You I have 64 on this machine and heap at 48G, though usually never even 1/8 of that used
[02:26:48] <mfiano> But on ocassion I create incredibly large arrays and don't want to lose my image
[02:28:16] <madnificent> Looking at the earlier discussion on GPUs: I recall "doing" deep learning on a CPU with Common Lisp somewhere 2006-2010 and it was terrible for various reasons (most being me).  Is GPU support (preferably AMD) here now for these cases?  Is that a pipe dream?
[02:29:01] <mfiano> I don't do too much GPGPU stuff, nor have I used an AMD. |3b| might be one to ask.
[02:29:10] <hayley> eazy-opencl usually doesn't blow up on me™, and GPGPU on AMD works fine.

[02:30:44] <madnificent> Oh, that would be a good case to test my graphics card on.
[02:30:49] <VincentVega> mfiano: I was entertaining the idea of an infinite sheet and a relatively small amount of objects, so it's not really for immediate gpu consumption. I haven't yet decided how badly I want infinity though... But yeah, I am getting the hang of the codebase so far, I think.
[02:32:06] <mfiano> VincentVega: Great. I am sort of on break this week, so I can't be of much help unfortunately. But if you come up with something, send a PR or open issues or whatever. I'd love to see what you come up with.
[02:32:07] <|3b|> VincentVega: trying to use rationals in generic graphics code is probably not going to work well even without considering the size problems, too many operations require irrationals :/
[02:33:19] <mfiano> That is also a good point
[02:33:27] <VincentVega> 3b: yeah, true! But an occasional irrational doesn't take away the infinity...
[02:33:47] <|3b|> it does if a double-float in a transform matrix infects everything else :)
[02:33:48] <VincentVega> mfiano: cool, thank you, if I come up with something good, I will make sure to send a PR
[02:34:51] <VincentVega> 3b: yeah that would take some care or type coercion to avoid I guess
[02:35:03] <VincentVega> hell, infinity is hard
[02:35:10] <|3b|> nah, infinity isn't actually that hard
[02:35:41] <|3b|> just need to respecify it as finite regions around and infinite grid
[02:36:13] <|3b|> subtract out the infinity and dump that in a bignum, then do the rest in single-floats or whatever
[02:36:20] <mfiano> is this for the ray tracer?
[02:36:25] <mfiano> or was that someone else?
[02:36:44] <VincentVega> nah, it can be pretty hard, man, I took real analysis and everything there is about screwing around with infinity in some way
[02:37:01] <VincentVega> mfiano: gui
[02:37:04] * |3b| meant "computer graphics infinity" not "math infinity" :p
[02:37:13] <mfiano> ah
[02:37:19] <VincentVega> 3b: I understand : )
[02:38:51] <|3b|> though i guess there is also the question of whether you want infinitesimal in addition to infinite, that's a bit more work than just chopping off the bignum part
[02:40:07] <|3b|> gui is possibly in an easier subset of "graphics" for using rationals though, can do a lot of gui without rotations for example
[02:40:37] <VincentVega> 3b: I guess so, yeah. The edge cases, huh.
[02:41:18] <VincentVega> 3b: gui isn't supposed to be very hard or anything, sure

[05:06:29] <|3b|> looks like that should exit the loop (possibly at the wrong time?) and you just want to return LIST from the let*
[05:07:03] <Xach> Spawns_Carpeting: are you interested in general feedback, beyond just the returning a value bit?
[05:07:08] <Spawns_Carpeting> thats a good idea, and sure Xach
[05:07:17] <|3b|> actually, you also want to store things into LIST before returning it
[05:07:51] <Xach> Spawns_Carpeting: appending to a list repeatedly can be slow. loop's COLLECT is usually a better option in that situation.
[05:08:19] <Xach> Spawns_Carpeting: also, (subseq string pos) is equivalent to (subseq string pos nil)
[05:09:19] <Spawns_Carpeting> i couldn't figure out how to get this to work with collect and still collect the last substr after search returns nil
[05:09:35] <Spawns_Carpeting> i will try to figure that part out
[05:09:37] <|3b|> test for last search returning NIL after collecting it
[05:11:10] <|3b|> also, i'd probably prefer () or NIL over (list)
[05:11:55] <|3b|> and you can let LOOP update POS for you, (loop for pos = 0 then i for i ...)
[05:16:16] <Spawns_Carpeting> how does "then" work?
[05:16:32] <Spawns_Carpeting> the lisp cookbook thing only has a tiny little section on that
[05:16:45] <Spawns_Carpeting> it seems to make it alternate between two values on every iteration
[05:18:01] *** Quits: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.96.21) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:18:29] <|3b|> THEN is optional part of FOR = syntax. "FOR x = form1 THEN form2" sets X to result of evaluating FORM1 on first iteration and to result of evaluating FORM2 on subsequent iterations
[05:18:55] <Spawns_Carpeting> oh I see now
[05:18:58] <Spawns_Carpeting> very handy
[05:19:05] <|3b|> so FOR POS = 0 THEN I sets POS to 0 on the first iteration, then to the current value of I on later iterations
[05:19:26] <|3b|> and since it is before the FOR I ..., it sees the value of I from previous iteration
[05:23:50] <Spawns_Carpeting> this is what I ended up with now https://bpa.st/IQSA
[05:24:33] <|3b|> i think WHILE isn't legal there, so you should put WHILE I at the end instead
[05:25:36] <|3b|> and if you are using SEARCH because you want to accept arbitrary strings as delimiters, you should skip by length of delimiter. if not, you might want POSITION instead
[05:26:18] <Spawns_Carpeting> whats the difference between position and search?
[05:26:37] <Spawns_Carpeting> i do want delimiters to be able to be of any length
[05:27:02] <hayley> POSITION finds one element, e.g. #\Space, SEARCH finds a sub-sequence, e.g. "foo"
[05:27:03] <|3b|> search looks for a sequence as a subsequence of another. position would find a single element in a sequence
[05:27:25] <|3b|> ok, sounds like you want search then
[05:28:45] <Spawns_Carpeting> thanks for the help btw, I added (+ i (length delimiter) as well and it seems to work great
[05:29:12] <Spawns_Carpeting> i realize there is uiop:string-split and ppcre split but I wanted to practice my lisp
[05:29:53] <Spawns_Carpeting> why is collect faster than appending to a list by the way? does it have some special optimization
[05:29:59] <Spawns_Carpeting> that is good to know
[05:30:14] <|3b|> might want to check for empty delimiter so that doesn't loop infinitely
[05:30:55] <Xach> Spawns_Carpeting: it generally keeps track of the tail of the list so it does not have to traverse from the beginning each time
[05:32:44] <|3b|> append has to duplicate all but the last list, so accumulating N items with append copies on average 1/2 N elements for every element you add, so O(n^2)
[05:33:18] <|3b|> collect can be expected to do something efficient internally, so should be O(1)
[05:33:23] <|3b|> O(N) i mean
[05:35:18] <|3b|> when accumulating a list like that manually, it is fairly common to accumulate with PUSH or CONS (which adds to beginning of a list without any copying), and then REVERSE or NREVERSE it at the end, which is N operations to build the list, and N to reverse it, so also O(N)

[07:39:08] <|3b|> note that the high-level wrapper part of cl-opengl (the GL package) has some parts that are old,poorly designed, and/or not a good fit for "modern" opengl, so you might need to use the low-level parts in %GL which are just direct bindings to the C API
[07:41:16] <|3b|> but as far as i know, pretty much everyone (that i've noticed on IRC) is using cl-opengl for GL
[07:41:50] <|3b|> how you get a window+context to use GL with has a bit less agreement :)
[07:43:21] * |3b| can't help with that, since the options i use (glop/glop2 and cl-glut) are probably bad choices. cl-sdl2 seems popular, and possibly some use glfw bindings

[10:14:18] <Spawns_Carpeting> or a better question, does (car list) return some sort of special reference where (1) evals to the number 1?
[10:14:49] <Spawns_Carpeting> i am curious how set works compared to the = operator in c like languages, or compared to how r and l values work
[10:15:26] <hayley> No reference is returned.
[10:16:14] <hayley> Instead (setf (car list) 2) could expand to e.g. (funcall #'(setf car) 2 list) which performs the modification. Or it could expand to some other form.
[10:16:53] <hayley> But generally SETF expands to a call to a function that modifies the object.

[10:46:36] <phoe> Spawns_Carpeting: "how can setf tell the difference between (setf 1 2) and (setf (car list) 2)" - SETF is a macro and it has access to its unevaluated arguments, and therefore it can see that it needs to set a CAR and expand accordingly
[10:47:08] <phoe> and for comparison with elisp, it can expand into a RPLACA call, which is CL's way of saying SETCAR

[17:10:51] <nij-> That's great :) CL doesn't miss things and allows users to extend itself. However, there was a time when amazing extensions (e.g. ASDF, QUICKLISP, CLIM.. etc) did not exist. I wonder if there are some great extensions of CLOS that haven't come to existence yet.
[17:11:01] <_death> nij: take a look at frame systems of the past.. in some ways they are more general than OO, e.g., they support links other than "is-a", slots can have multiple values (called facets), etc.

[17:15:03] <_death> they also tend to be more dynamic (sometimes paying the price of efficiency) and makes less of a distinction between classes and objects
[17:18:46] <scymtym> there is also Smalltalk-style MessageNotUnderstood which (i think) can be used, among other things, to implement generic proxy objects that respond to any message without explicit method definitions. even the concept is difficult to express in CLOS terms

[17:20:33] <jackdaniel> scymtym: perhaps specializing no-applicable-method on a generic-function metaclass would be a good start?
[17:22:31] <scymtym> jackdaniel: to some extend, maybe. but NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD cannot specialize to the argument classes and multiple such behaviors wouldn't compose
[17:22:55] <_death> if you have a GF where all operations pass through you can have a "message not understood"
[17:24:03] <scymtym> sure, but if i understand correctly, the smalltalk version works for any message without any preparation or convention (i may be wrong)
[17:25:22] <_death> yeah, because the constraints they have chosen enable that
[17:26:10] <phoe> the issue is what is a "message" in CLOS terms

[17:26:48] <phoe> multiple inheritance makes the "recipient" question troublesome
[17:27:24] <scymtym> multiple dispatch, you mean?
[17:27:42] <jackdaniel> hey, no-applicable-method's only method signature is specialized on T. does it mean that I can specialize it on standard-generic-function (i.e add an around method)?
[17:28:09] <jackdaniel> or I got it wrong and I can't specialize any standard function on the standard metaclass?
[17:29:28] <phoe> scymtym: welp, yes, sorry
[17:29:43] <phoe> jackdaniel: the latter, I think
[17:29:51] <phoe> I remember recently running into this issue
[17:30:08] <phoe> CLHS 11.1.2.1.2 point 19
[17:30:12] <phoe> http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw71/CLHS/Body/11_abab.htm
[17:30:12] <jackdaniel> thanks
[17:30:38] <phoe> ...but a custom GF would probably be good enough to implement that behavior
[17:30:49] *** Joins: gaqwas (~john@215.76.133.37.dynamic.jazztel.es)
[17:31:06] <jackdaniel> sure, but if you want to define "universal proxy object", you'd want it to work with functions defined by someone else too
[17:31:07] <phoe> because *then* you could specialize NAM and possibly defer to some kind of other dispatch mechanism that works on the types or classes of the *rest
[17:31:12] <phoe> oh, welp
[17:31:32] <phoe> that would require implementation support then - unless "someone else" also uses that custom GF
[17:31:40] <jackdaniel> oh well, just an exciting thought experiment
[17:31:45] <phoe> I don't think there's a portable way of doing what you describe :(
[17:32:30] <jackdaniel> well, around method and checking args for /your special proxy object/ would suffice to avoid conflicts, but nobody could add another around method :)
[17:32:54] <phoe> obviously, you'd need to provide some other dispatch mechanism then
[17:33:15] <phoe> mostly because you don't even know the length of arguments, so you can't use standard GF dispatch
[17:33:39] <jackdaniel> that's not a problem, you reapply all arguments as they were supplied, but with proxies replaced

[17:33:51] <jackdaniel> arity doesn't change from the original call
[17:33:57] <phoe> ooh, like that - yes, I see
[17:34:09] <scymtym> going back to original question, CLOS generic functions also cannot do "variable arity specializers". incidentally, having those would probably allow the "universal proxy" thing since you could do (defmethod n-a-m (gf (a1 proxy) &rest r)), (defmethod n-a-m (gf a1 (a2 proxy) &rest r))
[17:42:20] <_death> another interesting set of extensions to CLOS is that of a blackboard system like gbbopen (I mentioned this in private to nij, but may be interesting to others as well)
[17:42:34] <nij-> scymtym: I ran into that problem two times. Recently I found some old (unfinished?) project calling itself predicate dispatch. I don't know yet if that would solve the problem.

[17:46:08] <scymtym> nij-: if the whole object system used predicate dispatch, it would probably enable a solution. predicate dispatch as a user-defined generic function class would still require the kinds of coordination described above

[19:17:33] <jackdaniel> this is a fine question: assuming non-standard generic function - compute-applicable-methods-using-classes must be consistent with compute-applicable-methods (that is, when it returns its second value as true, then its first value must be equal to the result of compute-applicable-methods)
[19:17:49] <jackdaniel> does it mean that programmer must define methods for both
[19:18:31] <jackdaniel> or that the implementation can't return t as a second value of c-a-m-u-c when non-standard generic function is called? (because the programmer could have specialized only compute-applicable-methods)?

[20:40:52] <scymtym> i think it would make sense (in terms of performance) to have a generic function (pixel-interpolator image method) that returns a function x y -> pixel-value which closes over the results of WITH-IMAGE-DEFINITION and the type checks. the indirection through INTERPOLATE-PIXEL-CUBIC and interpreting the channel bits also seem like possible bottlenecks
