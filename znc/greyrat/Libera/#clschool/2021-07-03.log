[10:04:43] <derelict> hi everyone, ive been going through PCL and there's an example of COPY-LIST and COPY-TREE in ch 13. i don't quite understand when COPY-TREE is supposed to copy by reference vs by value. 
[10:05:17] <beach> Wow!
[10:05:35] <beach> What do you mean by "copy by reference" and "copy by value"?  
[10:05:41] <beach> There is only one kind of copy.
[10:05:54] <derelict> i'll tell you the example im struggling with beach 
[10:06:44] *** Parts: Retropikzel (~Retropikz@2001:999:202:1696:511:4378:6f76:bdee) (Leaving)
[10:07:08] <derelict> '((1 2) (3 4) (5 6)) <- i understand that, when using COPY-LIST on this structure, all CARS in the new structure are going to be the same references
[10:07:27] <beach> Common Lisp uses "call by value" for function call, and what that means is that the argument is evaluated before the function is called.  That's how pretty much every language (except Haskell) works.  But the values that are produced are references to chunks of memory, and chunks of memory are never implicitly copied.
[10:07:43] <beach> Correct.
[10:08:16] <White_Flame> think of it as "new cons cell" vs "reusing the same cons cell"
[10:08:22] <derelict> with COPY-TREE though, the book says that 5, 6 and NIL are shared by the original structure and new one 
[10:08:55] <White_Flame> 5, 6, and NIL are primitive values that don't have a first class identity, though
[10:09:11] <White_Flame> (although I guess EQ vs EQL might be a thing)
[10:09:17] <beach> derelict: Yes, only CONS cells are copied, not atoms.
[10:09:53] <derelict> thats what i thought White_Flame, but the book seemed to single out these particular atoms as opposed to the rest of the numbers in the structure
[10:10:12] <beach> Sounds like a mistake in the text.
[10:11:00] <derelict> oh phew, ive been looking for answers everywhere :)
[10:11:04] <derelict> thank you beach and White_Flame 
[10:11:33] <beach> Pleasure.
[10:11:39] <White_Flame> I'm looking at chapter 13, and it's all talking about cons cells
[10:11:56] <derelict> yeah you're right beach, the error is corrected in the online version of the text
[10:12:10] <White_Flame> it's the cons cells holding 5 and (6 . NIL) that are being concerned, not the 5/6/NIL values themselves
[10:12:18] <White_Flame> ah, ok. I'm looking at the online one
[10:13:20] <derelict> White_Flame: in the print, it says that only 5,6 and NIL are shared. but the online version says all numbers from 1-6 and NIL are shared  
[10:13:36] <beach> That's better.
[10:14:41] <White_Flame> ok.  Those values in the cons cells might even be structs, hashtables, and other objects, and the same object would be shared, too
[10:15:00] <White_Flame> copy-list and copy-tree only concern themselves with the cons cells of the input form
[10:15:12] <White_Flame> other values are reused
[10:15:48] <derelict> i see, thank you for the explanation :)
[10:16:54] <White_Flame> and a cons cell is actually just a generic 2-tuple datastructure.  A list happens to be one convention of arranging them
