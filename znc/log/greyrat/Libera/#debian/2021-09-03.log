[01:05:36] <greycat> you shouldn't be running grub-install

[04:59:21] <freem> Hi. I added the i386 architecture via dpkg --add-architecture, updated the apt list, and installed wine32, yet `apt-file show wine32` gives nothing. I `dpkg-deb -R` it, and there were (obviously) files in the deb. I remember there was an executable named wine32 at a point in time, but I can't find it anywhere in there. Are all those expected?
[05:00:10] <sney> I think if there was ever a wine32 executable, it was just a wrapper for the 32-bit 'wine' binary
[05:00:23] <greycat> try "dpkg -L wine32 | grep /bin"

[11:19:03] <pascal_> I have a small question about building a package. Once the package is built, it behaves differently depending on the command used (apt-get / aptitude)
[11:19:06] <pascal_> In one case apt-get exits the installation with this message:
[11:19:08] <pascal_> exim4-config : Conflicts with: postfix but 3.5.6-1+b1 should be installed
[11:19:11] <pascal_> E: Error, pkgProblem::Resolve has generated breaks, which may have been caused by the packages being kept as is.
[11:19:14] <pascal_> With aptitude the behaviour is more normal in that it proposes to remove all exim4 packages and then install postfix.
[11:19:17] <pascal_> Where could the problem come from in the package itself?

[14:27:34] <afontain> hello folks. I've noticed I have some performance trouble with wordpress since the upgrade to buster, the new stable (congrats!)
[14:28:03] <afontain> I've tried rolling back the wordpress package, and it seems to be unrelated
[14:29:16] <willow> afontain: what webserver is being used?
[14:29:18] <afontain> the webserver is generally responsive (<400ms) for php things, but wordpress is taking a few seconds (1 to 3) to answer
[14:29:26] <afontain> willow: nginx
[14:29:44] <afontain> so I think it would have something to do with mariadb
[14:30:02] <willow> did you migrate the configuration for nginx as part of the upgrade?
[14:30:03] *** Joins: AsenMx (~AsenMx@78.90.248.234)
[14:30:36] *** Joins: Axyzhdeu (uid391113@user/axyzhdeu)
[14:30:41] <willow> for example set to point to correct php-fm version, etc.?
[14:31:44] <afontain> I did manually merge /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
[14:32:07] <afontain> essentially copying back one line from the old version
[14:32:51] <afontain> (about a 50MB max request size, to avoid pretty large uploads)
[14:33:22] <afontain> about the fpm, well, one thing I didn't do yet, is upgrading php
[14:33:37] *** Quits: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:33:51] <afontain> it's probably the last thing that's from oldstable, because for some reason aptitude didn't purge it automatically
[14:34:05] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[14:34:15] <afontain> so it's using 7.3 (buster) instead of 7.4 (bullseye) at the moment
[14:34:41] <willow> egrep -r 'php.*-fpm.sock' /etc/nginx
[14:35:05] <afontain> this doesn't seem to break anything, though, and dokuwiki has response times of 300ms usually, counting the network ping and all that
[14:35:37] <willow> the php-fpm version should match the upgraded version
[14:35:47] *** Quits: xet7 (~xet7@user/xet7) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:35:54] <afontain> willow: huh, it's empty
[14:36:07] <afontain> well, if I don't count  /etc/nginx/sites-available/default: # fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
[14:36:14] <afontain> (commented out)
[14:36:53] *** Joins: xet7 (~xet7@user/xet7)
[14:37:13] <afontain> right, the fpm sockets names are custom
[14:37:23] <afontain> but it's php7.3 really
[14:37:40] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[14:37:47] <afontain> note the database is on another debian server
[14:38:03] <afontain> also upgraded to bullseye
[14:38:16] <willow> that could be a bottleneck
[14:38:28] <afontain> it worked well before, at least
[14:38:50] <afontain> it's a different system (container), but on the same machine
[14:39:10] <afontain> ping time is about 0.067 ms
[14:40:02] *** Quits: dselect (~dselect@debian/bot/dselect) (Quit: ouch... that hurt)
[14:40:46] <afontain> so I assume other people haven't noticed mariadb being slower than before or anything?

[15:08:01] <lucad111> Hi everyone, has anyone found issues upgrading from buster to bullseye on arm64 architecture? specifically after the upgrade the OS can't find the rootfs anymore ( simple sata disk )
[15:08:20] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[15:08:54] <PMT> worked fine on my RPi4, which is not using SATA. Does booting the old kernel still work?
[15:10:08] <PerfDave> That's not a problem I had on my Bullseye system after upgrade
[15:10:21] <lucad111> PMT, yes the 4.19.x still works
[15:10:38] <lucad111> PerfDave, arm64 arch?
[15:10:45] <PerfDave> lucad111: Oh sorry, I misread
[15:10:58] <lucad111> PerfDave, no worries
[15:12:06] <lucad111> PMT, I also tried reinstalling buster and using the backported kernel 5.10 and still had the same issue

[15:13:23] <cadmio> when trying to connect using the configuration in /etc/network/interfaces I'm not sure this part is correct DHCPDISCOVER on wlxf4f26d13b2bd to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 5
[15:13:39] <cadmio> shouldn't be 192.168.1.1 instead of 255.... ?

[15:16:50] <cadmio> ok How can I find the other problem?
[15:16:55] <lucad111> PMT,  this is a Socionext Synquacer platform, but no it should be just plain ahci i guess, it's the soc's sata controller alone
[15:17:02] <cadmio> I'm associated but I cannot get the IP address
[15:17:24] <PMT> lucad111: you can presumably ask lspci -vvv when on 4.19.x and see if it says it's ahci or something else

[19:28:00] <somiaj> there are also apps you can run to sync the two different clipboards, which can help with apps that use the old style vs the ones that use the new style
[19:28:04] <Haohmaru> do you mean merely selecting with the mouse?
[19:28:08] <somiaj> Yes
[19:28:16] <Haohmaru> isn't that a terminal thing?
[19:28:24] <somiaj> default xorg should automatically copy whatever you select with the mouse, and paste with the middle mouse button
[19:28:36] <Haohmaru> eww, i don't like that
[19:28:47] <somiaj> most aps I use respect that, my webbrowser, gvim, etc
[19:29:09] <somiaj> I prefer it over key combos, it is slick, quick and is indepednent of keybindings in different software
[19:29:19] <Haohmaru> i often select a bit of text on a webpage i'm reading when someone interrupts me and i gotta look away
[19:29:22] <somiaj> but it can cause problems between apps if you are mixing methods or not syncing clipboards

[19:34:35] <somiaj> I think part of why I like this is I do alot of copy/paste between terminals and other apps, and ctrl+c is bad in terminals (:

[19:36:16] <somiaj> Haohmaru: another thign I dont like about the ctrl-c/ctrl-v (Espically with browsers), is it coppies the formatting/metadata, and not just the text, while the select method only copies raw text, which I prefer.

[21:44:22] <sney> when you ran the debian installer, it would have asked you where to install grub, and you might have selected your main hard drive. typically people installing debian *want* it installed on a hard drive rather than a removable device, so that may have been the default
[21:44:44] <sney> anyway, if your other OS is windows, you can run windows's fixboot utility (I think that's the name) and it will happily reinstall its own bootloader for you
[21:44:54] <no_gravity> sney: I think I looked for such an option pretty closely but did not see it.
[21:45:21] <no_gravity> sney: "windows"? The last time I booted windows was when Windows 2000 came out.
[21:45:48] <no_gravity> sney: I used the manual partition option by the way.
[21:46:15] <joepublic> if your other os is $SOMETHING_ELSE, you can use $_THEIR_TOOL to fix the boot loader how it was before.
[21:46:23] <sney> well, "grub command line thing" suggested unfamiliarity with linux, so it was the logical other option. regardless, whatever OS is on your main hard drive should have a mechanism to reinstall its own bootloader and that will get rid of the "grub command line thing".
[21:48:33] <no_gravity> Yeah, I switched to Linux as my primary driver only recently.

[21:53:23] <PerfDave> The Debian installer that is the standard way to install Debian does ask you where you want to install the bootloader as part of the install process.

[21:58:27] <no_gravity> Hmm... It seems Debian only asks if it should install a boot loader at all: https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Install-Grub-Bootloader-Debian11-Installation.png
[21:58:47] <no_gravity> So it will install debian on one drive and the bootloader on another?
[21:58:50] <no_gravity> Why is that?
[21:59:41] <no_gravity> Even though I *think* it would have freaked me out to see that message (I was not using the graphical installer)
[22:00:00] <PerfDave> no_gravity: Oh, that's not a screenshot from your install?
[22:00:10] <PerfDave> That isn't the only question it asks IME
[22:00:12] <PMT> sometimes the boot drive isn't the install drive
[22:00:14] <no_gravity> PerfDave: No, its something I found on the net right now.
[22:00:43] <PerfDave> no_gravity: I'm not sure what you're hoping to get from this conversation TBH. The Debian installer *shouldn't* install your OS on one drive and the bootloader on another without asking you. So either it did that, and it's a bug, or you made a mistake, and it's a user error. If it's the former then please do report the bug. If it's the latter then never mind, we all make mistakes.
[22:01:28] <no_gravity> PerfDave: Well, I would have to do another install on another usb drive and use a camera to document the process I guess.
[22:02:08] <no_gravity> I wonder *what* it borked in my bootloader. Because it still works, it just comes up with this shell thing that I have to exit before it continues now.

[23:28:24] <tesseract> what do you guys think about this terminal? https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby
[23:28:36] <tesseract> it looks awesome
[23:29:46] <vipulogmx_> I use urxvt which i compile myself
[23:31:04] <somiaj> I just stick with xterm, I'm borning
[23:31:17] <somiaj> tesseract: you going to build it into a debian package and get a sponsor and matain it for us?
[23:32:15] <vipulogmx_> Xterm doesn't support Unicode and whatnot urxvt solves all that while being light on resources at the same time
[23:32:44] <sney> I use yakuake, I got hooked on that f12 drop down as soon as I tried it
[23:32:59] <sney> tabby looks like it has some cool features though, so it should be submitted to debian

[23:34:16] <sney> right, whichever one integrates with your desktop
[23:34:34] <vipulogmx_> Why is wezterm still not on Debian it's a great terminal
[23:34:50] <sney> ,bug wnpp wezterm

[23:36:49] <vipulogmx_> Oh i talked with main dev wez regarding this. He wants to get it in repos.when I asked if i can maintain it on MPR or if henhimself can
[23:37:35] <sney> if you file an RFP bug for it, the process may be quicker once the package is actually submitted
[23:39:12] <vipulogmx_> How do I do that? And are you asking to me?
[23:39:25] <somiaj> vipulogmx_: xterm supports unicode
[23:39:58] *** Joins: mentor (~mentor@user/mentor)
[23:40:31] <vipulogmx_> I firstly tried xterm but had some problems. Urxvt had extra features while having no downside so I switched

[23:41:33] <vipulogmx_> Oh yeah xterm can't run neovim nvchad or vim or bashtop or bpytop properly and the colors were a mess. Urxvt works flawlessly for me
[23:41:35] <sney> vipulogmx_: yes, you. you're the one who wants the package in debian. so send an email to the BTS, requesting it formally. https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/#l2
[23:46:17] <vipulogmx_> sney: ok I'll use reportbug and make RFP
[23:46:26] <sney> cool, thanks for your contribution!

[23:48:19] <somiaj> yea, rxvt, and then urxvt is fairly popular, I just never needed any of that so xterm has always been fine for me (or uxterm really)
[23:48:39] <sney> vipulogmx_: not sure, it should be debian for best results, or you can just write an email as the second section describes
[23:49:15] <vipulogmx_> Ok
