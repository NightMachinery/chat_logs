[02:18:20] <DDDD> Hello. I've setup Arch with LVM on luks. I created a snapshot using lvcreate -L 20GB -s -n, used pacman -Syu to update the system and later after a few days merged the snapshot back to revert the changes. 
[02:20:38] <DDDD> I got the root/swap/home in the encrypted lvm and boot in its own partition. When i rebooted the system after using lvconvert --mege /dev/volgroup0/root-snap i couldnt boot the system. uname -r showed a later kernel version then what i could see in pacman -Q

[09:56:46] <derzahl>  is it at a certain offset?
[09:57:24] <grawity> just tell fdisk to set the partition type to some code that it doesn't recognize
[09:58:39] <grawity> for MBR it's a 1-byte hexadecimal number, I think 95% of them are assigned for something or other, but e.g. 'f5' or 'fa' seem to be unused – according to the list in the 't' command

[13:43:36] <JTL> Assuming you have little preexisting programming experience it's best not to "make the cart before the horse"
[13:43:37] <th0rne> JTL❱ He said "new to Arch", so maybe I misunderstood what he meant.
[13:43:44] <JTL> Could be
[13:45:13] <nikub> th0rne: Well i am using Arch for couple of months in a VM, before that i used Xubuntu for some time, also in a VM. But mostly for university work and some coding.
[13:45:25] <th0rne> But I'd say like, if you learn to use bash, grep, etc. you can make countless little qol things for yourself and learn about linux in the process.
[13:45:27] <nikub> I am trying to learn more about the system itself since i never tinkered much with it.
[13:45:44] <nikub> Yeah, i must learn grep
[13:45:47] <raster> th0rne: just from experience u start by doing a wm then you have to add porcess management, system diagnostics (show battery status, cpufreq controls, pkgkit front-end, backlight controlls, systemd interaxction, mpris2 support, bluez, etc. etc. etc.) .. wm adds compositing and so on so you start to touch so so so many different things and it gives you a wide view. then you start adding apps to fit the wm and have to 
[13:45:47] <raster> interact with more things - write a terminal emulator and leary just how pty's, terminal logic, escapes etc. work. - you end up writing a gui toolkit in the process just because you need one. you work with select/epoll and friends and write loop dispatchers, thread dispatching, custom memory management, deal with various rendering systems from software bhyte-banging to opengl/opengl-es etc. ... you just touch a lot of 
[13:45:48] <raster> things and the wide range gives you a lot of insight into things. of course if you think a wm is just i3 ... then you have a very limited view of a wm :)
[13:46:29] <th0rne> raster❱ Ok, perhaps we understood "learn linux" a bit differently.
[13:46:46] <nikub> I do not think a wm is just i3.
[13:47:03] <nikub> Personally i use dwm, it is the only window manager i tried so far and I really like how it turned out.
[13:47:36] <nikub> I haven't added gaps or other plugins for it except the one that changes where the master window is when i open the new window.

[13:48:02] <raster> mesa: i know. i came from the vic20/c64 then amiga world and was introduced to unix @ university so for me it was migrating from my amiga world to unix then linux as frankly i had to buy a pc ... and no way i was going ot use that weird windows stuff... unix was far more comfortable coming from the amiga world. i got my first pc with linux on it in 96 too ..  :)

[13:50:04] <raster> th0rne: i literally learned linux by doing this... ;) i had had an intro to unix before this - but just basic primer stuff you were given in university on your first day. like a terminal, ls, rm, emacs. that was like day 1. beyond that i learned by going "i hate this wm" ... as i discovered wm's were just another process and you could change them out for others so i swapped around a few then realised i wanted to write my 
[13:50:04] <raster> won and then the learning really began. so for me really learning was writing a wm. :)

[13:50:57] <th0rne> Ok, sure, I see that. That's perhaps a pretty deep learning experience, but I'm sure a good one.
[13:52:28] <raster> thus i do recommend it. it's jumping in the deep end, but you learn a lot. well at least i also write a filemanager (actually wrote 2 of them - stand-alone as well as integrated into the wm) and so you touch yet more parts of a system. you learn by doing. building your whole environment yourself is an amazing way to learn just how all of this fits together :)
[13:52:36] <mesa> raster: nice. I bought the book "UNIX Bible" which came with a Slackware CD in the back sleeve. It was slackware version 3.0 or 3.1 IIRC. I proceeded to purchase a used PC with windows on it and promptly wiped it out and installed slackware on my very first personally owned computer.
[13:52:55] <raster> mesa: in 96?
[13:53:06] <raster> like a 496 or pentium about then?
[13:53:10] <raster> err 486
[13:53:25] <nikub> raster: That is so inspiring, even though it seems like an impossible task for myself. I might try it when the exam period is over.
[13:53:26] <raster> infomagic slackware cd set for me :)
[13:53:56] <raster> nikub: and that is the mistake 99% of people make. "it's impossible for me". don't say that. you start with the wrong attitude. already defeated.
[13:53:59] <philluminati> Does arch packagemanager or repos hold older copies of Microsoft Edge?
[13:54:05] <mesa> well it was a 286 actually. then I bought several old pcs and took it all apart and ended up with a 386.

[13:55:15] <nikub> th0rne: Exams are nearing their end, problem is in my mind i think that even if i had 5 months of free time i wouldn't be able to do it even if that is probably incorrect.
[13:55:22] <raster> nikub: start by solving one small problem. then another one, and another... and another.. then slightly bigger problems and bigger. you end up learning it's not impossible. it's just work. and more of it. so an attitude of "damnit - i'll just jump in and get going and i'll figure it out in the end" will actually get you there. :)
[13:55:51] <mesa> raster: i386 dx is what I ended up with.
[13:55:57] <raster> nikub: but in all seriousness... start a project. start small.
[13:56:13] <nikub> raster: I have wanted to make a chat server before. Tried it for couple of days and just couldn't get the threads to do their job and kinda lost hope and abandoned it. I was thinking yesterday of starting it from scratch after the exams are over
[13:56:19] <raster> mesa: 286... eeek! but i thought you needed at least a 386 for linux back then?
[13:56:37] <nikub> Even a simple 2 people chatroom would be a great confidence boost.
[13:56:39] <raster> nikub:  try again :)

[13:57:11] <raster> (or c++) ?
[13:57:25] <mesa> see the next thing I posted here... started out with a 286 then I ripped several pc's apart and ended up with a i386 DX. 
[13:57:25] <nikub> raster: Yeah, i used sockets + C.
[13:57:25] <raster> or was it higher level?
[13:58:10] <Spiker01> Hello everybody. I've asked this before but not changed i3wm settings. How to: Move from the desktop (layer) to the adjacent desktop (layer) with arrows. This is how it is done in AwesomeWM, I want to do it in i3wm. Thank you.
[13:58:10] <raster> nikub:  cool. then ... my suggestion is don't throw threads in to start. start with your classic select() loop and just switch to handling each client in that loop.
[13:58:11] <nikub> I need to start spending my free time on programming and not on procrastrinating(if this is how its said, english is not my main language so sorry if i am hard to understand sometimes).
[13:58:41] <mesa> raster: btw, thanks for all the years of enjoyment I've had with Enlightenment.
[13:58:43] <raster> mesa:  oh so u didnt try linux on the 286 at all?

[14:01:22] <raster> nikub: start with the classic single threadded slect loop version. then next expansion might be "now have main select loop handle client connects and farm off clients to worker threads"
[14:01:41] <raster> but you will need to set up inter-thread communicat ions and so on and that adds work. so definitely a 2nd stage
[14:01:58] *** Quits: kill (~killown@user/killown) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:02:33] <raster> as a chat server then will need to have each client thread be able to handle some kind of broadcast from other clients (eg a client thread gets a line a user typed - it has to tell all the other clients conencted about this line so it can be sent out to them all)
[14:02:56] *** Joins: blindguard (~blindguar@2a02:908:1864:c200::2f4b)
[14:03:17] <nikub> Thanks for the info and the motivation :)
[14:03:38] <raster> in fact you probably do not want to do this kind of broadcast thing across threads as it'll be pretty inefficient. a single thread state machine here is probably better. the overhead of waking up every thread and sending out these broadcasts will probably be higher than any benefit of parallel execution you get on different cores. :)
[14:04:24] <raster> of course... that assumes a simple chat protocol. if the cpu time spent handling the protocol/clients gets very high... then it may help ... but then perhaps you have other issues :)
[14:04:26] <nikub> I think i read somewhere that threads can actually diminish performance if implemented badly
[14:04:32] <raster> correct
[14:04:36] <raster> 100% right.
[14:04:53] <raster> they can badly reduce performance if used badly enough.
[14:05:13] <raster> my experience is that one of the best ways to use threads is worker pools.
[14:05:30] <raster> so basically have a master main-loop thread that is basically a big event processing engine
[14:05:34] <raster> this is your core logic.
[14:05:44] <raster> then work gets put in queues/lists
[14:05:50] *** Joins: chaseleif (~user@216-82-207-211.dyn.grandenetworks.net)
[14:06:05] <raster> and a thread wakes up when this happens and processes the first thing on the queue sending results back to mainloop when done.
[14:06:20] <raster> you have N threads sleeping in this pool processing this work queue.
[14:06:45] <raster> you use this worker pool if your work items are large enough where you can spend a good chunk of cpu cycles on it

[14:08:30] <raster> nikub: and using linux in a vm is probably one of the easiest ways to do any dev. arch has so many langs and tools available for free with a quick pacman -S ...
[14:09:09] <nikub> Yeah i have noticed that. I absolutely love pacman.
[14:10:43] <raster> nikub: so definitely pick a small project and solve it. beat your head on it and don't give up. once you solve one problem then another and another.. it gets easier. you get more confident. eventually you realise everything is just a matter of time and effort. it's not impossible. i hope you do this and you can make a cool little chat server. use it to learn more. eg expand it to with more features. write the client side 
[14:10:44] <raster> apps too. perhaps throw in a gui for the clients to learn how that stuff works and so on.

[14:14:32] <raster> nikub: then absolutely .. use your holidays after exams to get stuck into coding things in c. 
[14:14:49] <Spiker01> <mesa> It doesn't work for me. What should be written in the configuration file? I want me to press Mod + Right Arrow and move to the right.
[14:15:04] <mesa> yeah! well, I started using a new-to-me Music Player lately called "Pragha". I just really love it. I lightly researched pragha by skimming docs and such and the devs are proud to let you know it is written in Pure "C". Pragha is what helped me decide to learn C over other languages. 
[14:15:14] <mesa> inspired by Pragha
[14:15:31] <raster> nikub: basically the more time you spend on it the less it becomes a barrier to your goals. at some point you get fluent enough were the language is no longer a problem at all. you know how to use it to solve what you want to, the question is how to solve problems and not how to deal with the language :)
[14:15:48] <nikub> raster: I will. I m not sure if there are many job opportunities for C programmers outside of embedded space.
[14:16:06] <nikub> raster: Yeah i have heard that said many times on the internet. I hope to achieve that someday
[14:16:38] <mesa> ah well Spiker01, you should be able to bind those keys yourself. 
[14:16:44] <raster> nikub: thus . not trendy. but knowing c is key to understanding machines.

[14:18:59] <nikub> I guess it is
[14:19:15] <raster> we still need peolpe to work on kernels, firmware, drivers, core middleware like llvm, compilers, mysql/mariadb, chrome, v8, other jits and language vm's etc. etc.
[14:19:47] <Spiker01> <mesa> Yes. Thank you. I understand it. I hope I didn’t tire you. I read the documentation, of course, but I don't understand English well. I am not a native speaker. Tell me which name "action" (function) will move me to the screen on the left or to the screen on the right?

[14:20:31] <nikub> Yeah but learning how to work on these things seems much much harder to me than learning web development for example. I have had a class in web development this semester and i really learned a lot and could build a functional website that was connected with a Mongo database etc.

[14:42:54] <LilUFO> I compiled the latest SDL2 sources and seems to fix the issue 
[14:43:20] <LilUFO> hopefully things will be normal after a new xorg or sdl2 release 
[14:43:42] <LilUFO> or nvidia driver itself 
[14:43:45] <raster> is sdl2 actually swizzling the screen res for you?
[14:44:00] <raster> i dont think it would... it would just scale up what is rendered to the window size...
[14:44:24] <LilUFO> well it doesn't properly display non-native fullscreen 
[14:44:28] <raster> though there was a time many many moons ago when games loved to lpay with xf86vidtune and mess the universe up :)
[14:44:44] <raster> i wonder if sdl still has maybe xrandr code to mess with screen res?
[14:45:08] <LilUFO> I'm not sure, it leaves the desktop in an odd state 
[14:45:22] <LilUFO> where you can scroll around a larger resolution 
[14:45:24] <chazy> can these errors be hardware-related? https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/4b212392f45b705946afff6a65cc1fbf

[14:46:17] <raster> no. but if you are scrolling around ... something is messing with the output resolution. this is a recipe for disaster.
[14:46:28] <raster> its very very very unsociable.
[14:46:50] <LilUFO> someone else had this issue before I read 
[14:46:59] <LilUFO> it has to do with nvidia 
[14:47:05] <raster> it's my pet peeve in xrandr design that it didnt get a lock on it like wm's and compositors so only 1 client can control res.
[14:48:04] <chazy> i'm getting these call traces, errors and a bug in the journal: https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/1015e983ee215bdd92cf2093c23d3d79

After creating a base file with dd it seems I can use regular parted commands to create partitions in the file, however afterwards I'm unsure how to format the partitions. How do I point mkfs.* to the relevant partition within the file?

[19:49:07] <phrik> Title: rsync - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[19:49:16] <NeverSummer> ttnk, "rsync will work even while the system is running, but files changed during the transfer may or may not be transferred, which can cause undefined behavior of some programs using the transferred files."
[19:49:26] <NeverSummer> Specifically the Full system backup sub-section.
[19:49:54] <NeverSummer> Basically it works fine most of the time except for the times it doesn't, up to you.
[19:49:55] <moonshine> imo, you should create the partitions on the target drive first, in case of alignment issues
[19:49:57] *** Joins: drive_desaster (~nik@2a02:8108:9340:2b00::dc7a)
[19:50:32] <NeverSummer> Well if you're using rsync not dd you'd have to do that.  It's not going to partition a drive for you.
[19:50:33] <moonshine> once the partition table is there, you can dd across (which is really your only choice if encrypted).  uuids will be different

[19:51:16] <ttnk> i already did the partitions
[19:51:17] <NeverSummer> I mean most people aren't encrypted and there's nothing stopping him from doing what he asked, which is copying the files using rsync rather than bit streaming the data directly with dd.
[19:51:27] *** Quits: scabby_ (~scabby@user/scabootssca) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[19:51:35] <moonshine> that's an assumption
[19:51:37] <NeverSummer> rsync just requires you to partition and format the new drive first.
[19:51:38] <moonshine> dd works either way.
[19:51:45] <NeverSummer> He literally asked about rsync.
[19:52:04] <moonshine> that's fine.
[19:52:14] <NeverSummer> So yes I made the assumption that he's not lying about wanting to do the thing he asked about in order to answer the questoin about doing the thing?
[19:52:30] <moonshine> calm your tits. my point was something else: partition alignment
[19:52:38] <ttnk> there are no encrypted partitions and i have to do it fast while working, but im not sure about mounted drives if i have tu umount external drives

[20:00:03] <grazzolini> ttnk: use rsync -aAX (throw in a S if you have sparse files) and you should be fine. I've transferred many installations with this.
[20:00:49] <MacGyver> grazzolini: from an online system, without a settlement sync?
[20:01:17] <grazzolini> MacGyver: I've always used archiso, mounted src and dest and synced
[20:01:31] <grazzolini> I don't recommend syncing with the source system booted up
[20:01:37] <MacGyver> ttnk: ^ So offline.
[20:01:37] <NeverSummer> Same, but I mean there's not a particularly strong reason why it can't work live.

[20:02:24] <grazzolini> there are other reasons too
[20:02:37] <NeverSummer> Apparently, that's why I asked what they are.
[20:02:39] <NeverSummer> I'm curious.
[20:02:40] <baltazar> or just use -x (= --one-file-system)
[20:02:57] <NeverSummer> The fact that I didn't come up with any myself is the reason for the question.
[20:03:11] <grazzolini> NeverSummer: I don't even use excludes
[20:03:15] <MacGyver> The only really compelling reason is data integrity.
[20:03:39] <NeverSummer> Sure, but data integrity of what?

[20:03:58] <MacGyver> Of files being written at point or after point of clone.
[20:04:30] <MacGyver> You *need* an offline settlement sync when cloning a system. I'm not certain whether that sync will be faster than the initial online sync to begin with if both drives are local.
[20:04:42] <MacGyver> If it's not, might as well do the entire thing offline anyway.
[20:04:47] <NeverSummer> Right but assuming you aren't doing an update during the copy process I'm not sure what files that would be, since we're excluding most of the caching and logging folders.
[20:04:50] <NeverSummer> var I guess.
[20:04:55] <NeverSummer> Depending on what you have in there.
