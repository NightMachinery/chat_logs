[00:33:31] <Venia> Sorry about that, it keeps booting me. Not sure why. 
[00:47:23] <OnlineCop> Venia: Are versions /7 or /8 actually matching correctly?
[00:50:36] <Venia> They are not. 
[00:50:52] <Venia> We have to make sure that the regex excludes /'s with do not have spaces wrapping them. 
[00:51:05] <Venia> I've been trynig to figure that out but I've had to look up videos for some of the regex's you use. 
[00:51:18] <Venia> Namely the difference between named, atomic, and exclusion groups. 
[00:51:34] <Venia> I've been learning a ton today! This is huge :)  I would lot to know if there is a way to pay you back for helping. 
[00:52:05] <OnlineCop> Nah, don't worry about it. I do regexes for fun, since they're a good challenge.
[00:52:31] <OnlineCop> You can buy the site owner a coffee if you wanted; he would appreciate it more (server costs and all that).
[00:52:33] <Venia> Anyway, do you see in version 8s example text I added some instructions that says either <should/should not be excluded>? 
[00:52:43] <Venia> will do! 
[00:52:50] <OnlineCop> Yeah; those notes are helpful.
[00:53:01] <Venia> I'm a huuuuge fan of open-source so I spend a decent amount of money supporting free and open software regularly. 
[00:53:57] <OnlineCop> So what I'm thinking is that we `(?>...)` any characters not `/`, `{`, `}`, and not whitespace. Then we'd do an OR and then match whitespace, so long as it's not whitespace-`/`-whitespace. And then repeat all of those 0+ times.
[00:54:30] <OnlineCop> For the whitespace around the `/` character: can that include newlines or ONLY horizontal whitespace (tabs, spaces)?
[00:54:56] <OnlineCop> After all, "{foo[newline]/[newline]bar" would be considered a "separator".
[00:56:49] <OnlineCop> Venia: https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/9 isn't matching properly (notice that I commented out the end of the avatar3 line).

[00:59:37] <Venia> Hey sorry, boss called
[00:59:39] <Venia> I'm back. 
[00:59:43] <Venia> Let me catch up real quick. 
[01:00:23] <OnlineCop> TL;DR: Version /9 matches 3 avatars but not 4.
[01:01:24] <OnlineCop> Unless I got my logic backward: '[space]/[space]' should be the separator between avatars. '/[space]' or '[space]/' or '[no-space]/[no-space]' should all be part of the same "avatar" match?
[01:02:31] <Venia> I think the logic works yea :)  
[01:02:51] <Venia> I'm wracking my brain to find cornerstone exclusions but can't think of any so I think this works? 
[01:02:58] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/10 <-- funny enough, `grep -P` supports that (?(DEFINE)...) at the end, so you only have to write the expression once.
[01:03:36] <OnlineCop> Does your TEST STRING contain 3 avatars or 4?
[01:03:49] <Venia> I'm not sure we can do that TBH. I'm looking at InDesign and it says it may not be supported unless you by the extension script provided (thanks adobe -.-) 
[01:04:19] <Venia> The test string should be 4 avatars seperated by 3 /'s in ALL cases, wrapped by one set of {}'s 
[01:04:27] <OnlineCop> I wonder if InDesign can handle the (?>...) atomic groups or ++ atomic quantifiers?
[01:04:38] <Venia> Also a good question
[01:04:52] <OnlineCop> So "./<shouldbeexcluded>" should be part of the same group?
[01:05:07] <Venia> reviewing support docs for that now. 
[01:05:13] <Venia> That is correct yes. 
[01:05:40] <OnlineCop> I don't think the TEST STRING has 4 avatars/groups then.
[01:06:04] <Venia> The test string was purposely broken to prove the example. 
[01:06:18] <Venia> In that test tring there are supposed to be 3 because we broke it so we have a negative case. 
[01:06:31] <Venia> Thta is reporting true, but not accurate and we did that on purpose to ensure we had one of each / usage. 
[01:06:47] <OnlineCop> I mean, you COULD have any number of avatars: Just wrap any additional (?'avatarN'...) within  `(?:...)?` so the entire group is made optional.
[01:06:50] <Venia> That's my fault XD  
[01:07:02] <Venia> Yuppers :)  I tested that to make sure it worked and got that to work. 
[01:07:10] <OnlineCop> Does InDesign support `(?!...)` ?
[01:07:26] <Venia> From what I understand it's fairly easy to add an avatar - it follows the same logic as a JSON script but with reg-ex language and I am totally on board with that. 
[01:07:36] <Venia> http://www.ericagamet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Erica-Gamets-GREP-Cheat-Sheet.pdf
[01:07:52] <Venia> ^ this is the Adobe InDesign cheat sheet. Perhaps that will help.  I'm reviewing it now. 
[01:08:12] <OnlineCop> I believe https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/11 would be a one-liner if InDesign doesn't support PCRE's `(?(DEFINE)...)` syntax.
[01:08:56] <Venia> Adobe does support simple subexpressions
[01:09:18] <Venia> I'm not seeing any mention of supporting named groups and ?! is not showing in the cheat sheet? 
[01:09:44] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/12 is the same as 11 but with ' / ' added so they match as expected.
[01:10:08] <Venia> It does support ?! (negative look aheads)
[01:10:11] <OnlineCop> I see `(?:)` but not `(?>)` so you might need to change those.
[01:10:20] <Venia> hmmmm
[01:10:21] <Venia> Yeah. 
[01:10:54] <OnlineCop> It doesn't support the `++` quantifier, so I might have to change the look-ahead.
[01:11:55] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/13
[01:12:27] <OnlineCop> Now, `\s+(?!\s*\/\s)` will handle it.
[01:13:51] <OnlineCop> Again, you'll need to determine whether `\s` should match newlines. If you want to exclude them, you could try `[\t ]` in their place.
[01:14:14] <OnlineCop> The "grep quick reference" doesn't mention [^...] for "any character except", but I would be surprised if it didn't support it.
[01:14:45] *** Joins: re101-cat-5 (~re101-cat@c80-217-55-249.bredband.tele2.se)
[01:15:48] <Venia> I just googled and did confirm that adobe supports [^...] for exception.
[01:15:59] <Venia> If they didn't I'd be extra aggravated. 
[01:17:38] <Venia> wow, I am so surprised and happy, given the way this expression looks right now, that I came in to chat. It would have taken days for me to figure this out. 
[01:18:17] <Venia> So will V13 work for a generalized paragraph of 4 seperate avatars seperated by [space]/[space] hyphens then? 
[01:18:20] <OnlineCop> https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/developing-applications/the-cfml-programming-language/using-regular-expressions-in-functions/regular-expression-syntax.html says that `(?>regex)` is supported.
[01:18:39] <OnlineCop> I believe v13 should. Do the TEST STRING text match as you want them to?
[01:18:50] <Venia> That is a much better resource
[01:18:52] *** Quits: re101-cat-5 (~re101-cat@c80-217-55-249.bredband.tele2.se) (Client Quit)
[01:18:54] <Venia> cool.
[01:19:36] <OnlineCop> It supports `(?x)` too, which was what those earlier (like /10) versions were using (just as an /x flag instead of `(?x)` inline).
[01:20:50] <OnlineCop> Actually, that's discussing Java vs. Perl. I don't know whether InDesign is either of those...
[01:23:15] <Venia> quote: According to Peter Kahrel's title "GREP in InDesign 3rd Edition" (ISBN: 978-0-9825083-6-7) - InDesign’s GREP uses the Boost libraries; information on these libraries is available from www.boost.org, especially Perl Regular Expression Syntax - 1.67.0
[01:23:21] <Venia> https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/120440/indesign-grep-what-is-the-base-syntax-of-indesign-grep
[01:23:26] <Venia> I'm not sure if that is helpful? 
[01:24:15] <Venia> Also quote, "I think it is based on Perl or PCRE engine."
[01:24:25] <OnlineCop> Yeah; boost should support `(?>...)` but... unless you notice a LOT of backtracking, the `(?:...)` should actually work fine.
[01:24:53] <Venia> cool.  
[01:25:10] <Venia> So, I just want to make sure I'm on the same page, what is the most recent expression we have so far? I believe we confirmed V13 worked? 
[01:25:42] <OnlineCop> Yes, v13 should be okay to use.
[01:26:04] <OnlineCop> At least, toss in a bunch of TEST STRINGs and see that things that should/shouldn't match work as you'd expect.
[01:26:35] <OnlineCop> If you prefer InDesign to support the multi-line regex that you had earlier, we could also update /14 to use the (?x) flag and then have some nice whitespace.
[01:26:40] <Venia> You are AWESOME Just so you know :)  
[01:27:03] <Venia> We will do some testing, pop it in to indesign, and if we have more struggle we'll pop back with some more specific issues or cornercases ^^ 
[01:27:13] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/14
[01:27:43] <OnlineCop> Occasionally, you have to escape the `\` characters. If that happens, click Code Generator on the left. Some of the languages will escape those special characters for you, so you can just copy-paste.

[01:35:12] <Venia> This one was definitely hard. 
[01:35:35] <Venia> I normally recommend they select special characters for each avatar and lead each comment with them, but they went ahead and produced the 300 pages without me which landed us where we are XD

[01:40:44] <OnlineCop> You're dealing with a bunch of special characters in addition to this?
[01:41:25] <Venia> no, that was just a typical recommendation. 
[01:41:30] <OnlineCop> A lot of your earlier multi-line paste was missing because of the anti-spam bot, so I didn't really see/understand which characters were supposed to be specially considered.
[01:42:15] <Venia> With prior clients I normally have them select a special character they would NEVER use in their copy to identify each avatar. Typically wrapping each avatar in %%Avatar%% or $$Avatar$$ kind of things so I can target start and finish of each one - but they didn't do that or ask for advice this time round. 
[01:42:33] <OnlineCop> I mean, if you're the one indicating that `[space]/[space]` should be the delimiter, then I'd say to choose something a bit more unique. But if someone else already decided that, then you can work with what you're given.
[01:42:45] <Venia> ^ This
[01:42:50] <Venia> I did not pick this delimiter
[01:43:00] <OnlineCop> Alright.
[01:43:07] <Venia> They didn't ask my advice first or I would have asked they pick a unique delimiter for each avatar.
[01:43:30] <Venia> they're 300 pages in with the current format already so not much I can do. 
[01:43:38] <OnlineCop> But they're 100% certain that their text will never contain the "avatar delimiter" anywhere?
[01:43:50] <Venia> 'yup
[01:43:56] <OnlineCop> Alright, that's fair then.
[01:44:02] <Venia> I forced them to make a choice, and then make the changes.
[01:44:27] <OnlineCop> I'm curious:
[01:44:41] <OnlineCop> Does the InDesign GREP allow for comments? (?#...this is a comment...)
[01:45:15] *** Quits: fedorafan (~fedorafan@user/fedorafan) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:46:45] <OnlineCop> If so, you could throw `(?# The below pattern splits avatar texts according to ' \/ ' delimiters)` just so you can understand what it's doing.
[01:47:10] *** Joins: fedorafan (~fedorafan@user/fedorafan)
[01:47:42] <OnlineCop> And it's possible that, within comments, the `/` delimiter doesn't have to be escaped: https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/15
[01:48:55] <Venia> I can test this when we have our meeting? 
[01:49:33] <Venia> oh actually, sorry
[01:49:45] <Venia> GREP styles will have the "description" seperated from the actual actions. 
[01:49:47] <OnlineCop> Of course. The links are permanent (unless you ask me to delete it) so you can reference it years in the future, if you need.
[01:50:08] <Venia> You title it, provide a description, and then do the styles. I presume that on InDesign's back end it's filling in the description with a comment code line
[01:50:20] <OnlineCop> Sure, but (?#...) can be put anywhere you want if (?x) is supported. :D
[01:50:34] <Venia> That's Fair
[01:50:38] <Venia> I'll test it ^^ 
[01:50:41] <OnlineCop> Especially useful if there are a lot of really complicated sub-expressions

[01:59:36] <OnlineCop> And if the regex flavor supports it, pepper it generously with comments to help understand those complicated bits.
[02:01:24] <Venia> Absolutely will do. 
[02:01:36] <Venia> Makes me wonder if google data studio supports comments.
[02:02:21] <OnlineCop> https://support.google.com/datastudio/answer/10496674?hl=en supports RE2 flavor (the "golang" flavor on regex101 is closest to that).

[06:45:53] <digitok> in case he comes back, https://regex101.com/r/Uy8ds9/19
[06:47:20] <digitok> assuming that works in whatever version of java regex indesign uses, we'd then change [^/}] to [^/}]+ and make the surrounding group quantifier possessive since java supports that
[06:47:43] <digitok> then he just changes 0 to 1/2/3

[11:50:30] <digitok> yea that's what i did
[11:50:56] <digitok> except i used 0 instead of 15
[11:51:04] <digitok> so change 0 to 15
[11:51:20] <digitok> we can simplify it slightly though

[13:51:03] <sstutz> just double checking but this [\w].{1,64} regex doesn't make a lot of sense, right? like I think the author meant to say 1 to 64 words (not sure tbh) but all it really does is to check for 64 characters and a word
[13:51:29] <sstutz> unless there's a regex dialect that interprets it as 64 words (thats kinda the question)?
[13:53:02] <Me-me> Okay so [\w] == \w for starters
[13:53:12] <Me-me> And also both [] and \w represent one character.
[13:53:28] <Me-me> So it's not 64 words or one word and 64 characters - it's one "word character" followed by 64 word characters.
[13:53:53] <Me-me> You are right that it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[13:54:36] <sstutz> poor wording, yes. obviously I meant word to say word character
[13:54:42] <Me-me> s/64 word/64 any
[13:54:44] <Me-me> s/64 word/64 any/
[13:54:45] <rebot> 14Me-me meant: s/0764 any14/64 any
[13:54:47] <Me-me> Heck.
[13:54:56] <Me-me> <Me-me> So it's not 64 words or one word and 64 characters - it's one "word character" followed by 64 any characters.
[13:55:08] <sstutz> thanks for confirming though! that threw me off for a second so I wanted to double check it :D
[13:55:27] <Me-me> Yeah.
[13:55:32] <Me-me> Best of luck.
[13:55:36] <sstutz> thanks!
[14:26:11] <digitok> it wouldn't've worked correctly even if you got it right :p

[18:19:00] <control> how can i add new lines after replacing digits? thank you
[18:22:46] <digitok> what should the result look like?
[18:23:01] <control> just replace the numbers
[18:23:18] <digitok> did you make the regex?
[18:23:30] <control> "s/^\d+\n?|\d+$//gm"
[18:23:32] <control> it was like this
[18:23:44] <control> but it only works if only numbers are and letters
[18:23:49] <control> but if there are some symbols
[18:23:54] <control> it doesnt work
[18:23:55] <digitok> so you just want to remove all digits
[18:24:00] <control> yes
[18:24:06] <digitok> that one only looks for digits at the start/end of a line
[18:24:22] <digitok> s/\d+//g
[18:24:26] <digitok> should be all you need
[18:24:36] <control> yes, but if digits contains symbols - it doesnt work
[18:24:57] <digitok> oh, you want 123-123 to be removed completely?
[18:25:36] <control> it works thanks digitok
[18:25:49] <control> thats what i was looking for
[18:25:52] <digitok> oh, cool :)
[18:25:53] <digitok> yw
[18:26:17] <control> how can i replace new lines
[18:26:21] <digitok> 07\n? means match a newline if there is one after the number
[18:26:25] <control> say if there werre number
[18:26:33] <control> it was replaced, it leaves empty line
[18:27:08] <control> just to remove empty lines after replacing
[18:27:23] <digitok> that's what the \n? did lol
[18:27:46] <digitok> but i assume you mean where the line only contains numbers
[18:27:51] <digitok> only then remove the newline
[18:27:53] <digitok> right?
[18:27:57] <control> yes
[18:28:46] <digitok> s/^\d+\n?|\d+//g
[18:28:48] <digitok> s/^\d+\n?|\d+//gm
[18:30:01] <control> perfect!
[18:30:41] <digitok> great :)
[18:31:14] <digitok> so we basically just removed 07$ from your initial regex haha
[18:31:20] <control> yes haha
[18:31:24] <control> i was looking for it
[18:31:28] <control> and i missed
[18:31:31] <digitok> hehe

[23:37:17] <re101-bracke-80> What I have so far is this - ^(.+):(.+):(.+):(.+):(.+):(.+):(.+):(.+):(.+):(.+):((?<=:)(?s)(.*$)) but it is not working as expected. Anyone able to help out?
[23:37:50] <OnlineCop> re101-bracke-80: Javascript?
[23:38:18] <OnlineCop> The 1st thing I would suggest is to change all `.+` to `.+?` so it matches as little as possible in each step.
[23:38:50] <re101-bracke-80> I'm working with Adobe Analytics Classifications, which just takes the above string. Not sure that it's using Java or not
[23:39:03] <OnlineCop> re101-bracke-80: Do you have a sample on regex101 you could post a link to?
[23:40:06] <re101-bracke-80> https://regex101.com/r/cXGJ43/1
[23:40:22] <re101-bracke-80> I had added '?' to each of the strings, except the last, and that seems to have done it!
[23:40:58] <OnlineCop> You can get rid of the `(?<=:)` after the last ':'.
[23:41:28] *** Quits: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd) (Quit: Later, nerds.)
[23:41:32] <OnlineCop> Since it MUST match a `:` character before the `(?<=:)` assertion is encountered.
[23:42:05] <re101-bracke-80> Awesome, that looks amazing. I'll do some more testing with that and a bunch of my classification strings to make sure it works
[23:42:10] <re101-bracke-80> but it looks like it's doing the job so far
[23:42:12] <re101-bracke-80> TY TY TY TY
[23:42:40] <OnlineCop> Will your data ever contain ':' that aren't field delimiters?
[23:43:23] <re101-bracke-80> No, we've been very clear on the need to reserve ':' as delimiters only
[23:44:05] <OnlineCop> Slightly faster:
[23:44:40] <OnlineCop> Instead of `(.*?):` you could use a negated character class for anything except colon: `([^:]*)`.
[23:45:34] <re101-bracke-80> I'll give that a shot and see how it works
[23:45:48] <OnlineCop> The `.*?` takes 2x as long to find results, but it finds the shortest possible. The `[^:]*` will find the maximum number of non-: characters quickly (and only backtrack if it fails later on).
[23:46:11] <OnlineCop> I'm looking on https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/classifications/classifications-rulebuilder/classification-quickstart-rules.html?lang=en#section_0211DCB1760042099CCD3ED7A665D716 to see if it mentions the regex flavor anywhere.

[23:51:34] <re101-bracke-80> Wow - 237 steps using `.*?` and only 46 steps using `[^:]*`
