[12:06:02] <iryith> for example when I went to university it was required to have a whole host of vaccines before you could live in the dormitories because people definitely die
[12:06:06] <dude12312414> (for example, how much worse will covid infection rates be if x% of the population is unvaccinated, and how much will this impact hospitals)
[12:06:10] <iryith> bacterial menengitis was a big one

[12:06:33] <iryith> I don't know if the infection rate would be much lower, but the hospitals wouldn't be so overrun
[12:06:57] <iryith> the vaccine isn't to prevent infection, just to mitigate the worst of the symptoms
[12:09:17] <dude12312414> right
[12:10:34] <iryith> I think if you were to have something like extra hospital costs for those that are not vaccinated that come in with Covid, then that might be something where the extra costs could go to expanding the infrastructure and thus the hospitals wouldn't be so overrun
[12:10:34] <dude12312414> we can also focus on differentiated approaches where vaccinations are given to the most vulnerable first, the groups which dominate the hospitalization cases

[12:12:48] <dude12312414> yeah, afaik the mandates don't really have age cutoffs (maybe for children they do)
[12:12:49] *** Joins: mikey (~mikey@user/mikey)
[12:13:23] <iryith> at least where I am (norway), they did it by age group, but now everyone is able to get the vaccine
[12:13:39] <dude12312414> sure, everyone should be able to get it
[12:13:44] <dude12312414> (if there are enough)
[12:13:55] <iryith> there are definitely enough now
[12:14:23] <iryith> and with drop-in vaccination sites it is incredibly easy to find a place to get one
[12:14:46] <iryith> so at this point, if you are unvaccinated it is a conscious choice
[12:15:24] <dude12312414> yes
[12:16:18] <iryith> but, yeah. I don't agree with forced vaccinations even though I sincerely think everyone should be vaccinated
[12:16:28] <dude12312414> i do think some poorer countries still have problems getting vaccines
[12:16:36] <iryith> they might, yeah
[12:17:24] <dude12312414> so maybe we can focus on them before forcing a 3rd dose on people who don't want it :)
[12:20:25] <iryith> I don't think the problem is availability, it's the wish to get one. People getting the 3rd are pro-vaxx anyway, so better to keep them properly in shape so when they do get infected they dont' go to hospital (which are going to be overrun with those that are not vaccinated)
[12:20:55] <iryith> The problem is that has become an issue of identity now, much like a political affiliation, so changing the mind of an anti-vaxxer is going to be neigh impossible

[12:25:32] <Aidhan> Pro choice ftw
[12:26:30] <iryith> to a point, s ure
[12:26:56] <Aidhan> No, people should be permitted to do whatever they want with their body
[12:27:23] <iryith> agreed, but what you do to your body rarely, if ever, only affects you
[12:27:32] <Aidhan> Indeed
[12:27:58] <iryith> so it's a conundrum on where a line is drawn between bodily autonomy and the affect it has on the society
[12:28:41] <Aidhan> If a person were to have drug induced psychosis and injure others or damage things, charge them for those issues.
[12:28:48] <causative> how about my bodily autonomy to not have the disease enter my body from someone else who caught it because they were not vaccinated?
[12:29:06] <Aidhan> Vaccinated people still catch it
[12:29:22] <causative> stunning display of logic
[12:29:25] <iryith> yes, but vaccinated people dont' have such severe symptoms where they require hospitalization
[12:29:55] <causative> the people who say "my body my choice" for vaccinations tend to also say "their body my choice" when it comes to women and contraception/abortion
[12:30:10] <Aidhan> What?
[12:30:21] *** Urawa is now known as Awaru
[12:32:33] <Aidhan> Vaccination does not stop spread, it was never designed to. Due to the nature of COVID, people can be infectious with nil symptoms particularly if vaccinated. Having people isolate when they’ve got it is a good strategy for your “bodily autonomously to not have it enter your body” but the problem is it’s simply not able to be done
[12:32:34] <dude12312414> by the way, one factor that would affect my own decision is whether I would need to take a vaccine periodically every year/n months or if it will be a fixed number like 2 or 3
[12:33:01] <causative> vaccination stops spread if enough of the population is vaccinated
[12:33:25] <causative> because vaccination reduces spread in the individual - not perfect, but to a great degree
[12:33:45] <causative> if collective spread is reduced sufficiently, the disease's r-factor goes below 1 and it dies out
[12:34:09] <Aidhan> Actually getting COVID and having antibodies for the virus rather than the spike proteins would go far further in reducing spread
[12:34:32] <iryith> it would also kill a shit-ton of people
[12:34:39] <causative> sure, except for the fact that if you get Covid you're going to infect others immediately
[12:34:43] <causative> which does not happen with a vaccine
[12:35:03] <Aidhan> Ideally, everyone gets vaccinated, it still spreads although symptoms are minimal and then once everyone has had it and built up antibodies to the virus itself, then it dies off
[12:35:07] *** Quits: cynicalcats (~cynicalca@user/cynicalcats) (Quit: ZNC - http://znc.in)
[12:35:19] <causative> it spreads less among vaccinated
[12:35:36] <causative> they're less likely to get it, less likely to be symptomatic, and they'll have lower viral loads, meaning they infect others less
[12:36:14] <Aidhan> Not even sure what the point of this exercise is
[12:36:25] <causative> getting covid is the best protection against covid, in a similar way that falling off a cliff is the best protection against falling off a cliff. Who needs guard rails? Guard rails aren't perfect, you can still fall off them. Instead of guard rails, everyone should just jump off the cliff to eliminate the risk.
[12:36:50] <Aidhan> What a poor analogy
[12:36:53] <causative> once you're at the bottom there is no further risk of jumping off the cliff.  It's perfect protection.
[12:37:17] <dude12312414> if there is an "expiry" date for the vaccines (as in, they stop being effective after a few months due to mutation or some other effect) then it becomes challenging to keep everyone vaccinated every few months forever
[12:38:04] <Aidhan> causative: amputation is the best solution
[12:39:23] <dude12312414> in fact that's kinda how it is for the flu, and it has never been mandatory to vaccinate against it

[12:40:12] <Aidhan> Anyway, I’m annoyed that vaccines are being mandated here for a significant amount of professions. I’ve been triple vaccinated before mandates became a thing, but the idea of effectively forcing someone to get vaccinated or lose their job and access to places just makes me angry
[12:41:56] <iryith> for professions like nurses/doctors, I think it is perfectly acceptable
[12:43:02] <Aidhan> Yes, because that is inherent to the role. Much like aged care workers require the flu vaccine. But for everyday people like office workers, retail, mining?
[12:43:45] <iryith> capitalism at work. a vaccinated workforce is a healthier workforce which means less money spent on sick days and medical costs
[12:43:48] <dude12312414> even for nurses/doctors, if you have a good doctor who is unwilling to vaccinate, is it worth losing a valuable resource for this?
[12:43:59] <dude12312414> maybe that is a decision that each hospital should make

[12:44:20] <Aidhan> It’s not capitalism. It’s enforced by state government
[12:44:34] <iryith> dude12312414, if it means that if I'm sick with something else and I go to a doctor that could potentially give me covid at a higher rate than a vaccinated one then yes
[12:44:35] <dude12312414> which is actually another issue
[12:44:48] <iryith> I would prefer not to die just from visiting my doctor
[12:45:11] <Aidhan> People lose their jobs, in a labour shortage, which worsens capitalist outcomes
[12:45:27] <dude12312414> but they have to take so many other precautions anyway like sterile gloves, masks, etc
[12:45:59] <dude12312414> so idk how much is the risk of being infected by a doctor in the OR
[12:46:01] <Aidhan> Haha let me tell you about hospital acquired infections
[12:46:57] <iryith> dude12312414, it's about mitigation and making sure every barrier is in place in places like hospitals so you don't end up killing more people
[12:48:00] <dude12312414> anyway i'm guessing that most doctors will naturally want to vaccinate so that won't really be an issue
[12:49:49] <dude12312414> they can also do PCR tests and stuff
[12:50:38] <iryith> sure, but by the time you get a positive on the test you have probably already spread it
[12:50:57] <dude12312414> well they'd have to do those regardless
[12:51:01] <dude12312414> even if vaccinated
[12:52:08] <dude12312414> but ok for doctors and nurses i can agree than mandates make sense
[12:52:42] <dude12312414> well, by the same logic it should be for any person that works in proximity to many people
[12:52:59] <iryith> sure. Teachers, police,
[12:53:14] <iryith> maybe retail workers
[12:53:29] <dude12312414> Here it starts getting murky
[12:53:34] <iryith> indeed
[12:53:39] <dude12312414> because retail is not a career
[12:53:44] <dude12312414> i mean it can be
[12:54:08] <dude12312414> but many do it as a side job, so they might not be willing to commit to this
[12:54:20] <iryith> doesn't have to be on career pathlines, just whatever job you have that might put you in contact with a large amount of different people each day
[12:56:40] <dude12312414> going down that path will lead to trouble
[12:57:11] <iryith> it could. That's essentially what the whole debate is about, where to draw that line
[12:57:16] <iryith> I don't have an answer to that
[12:57:19] <dude12312414> because i think inevitably there will be some disagreement on which jobs should be mandated
[12:57:26] <dude12312414> so we go back to where we are now
[12:57:53] <iryith> I think that's why there is a large group of people saying we should just vaccinate everyone
[12:58:07] <dude12312414> having no mandates at all is a clear line, vaccinating everyone is also a clear line
[12:58:31] <dude12312414> the former has some risks, the latter is practically impossible
[13:00:40] <iryith> All I know is that I am immensely happy I am not the one having to make these decisions
[13:00:50] <dude12312414> the free market solution would be to let every company decide on their own policies (which entails also privatizing hospitals, something which is controversial)

[17:15:16] <chatguy> more interested in talking philosophy, religion, society
[17:17:40] <xx> it is a philosophical and societal issue
[17:18:02] <xx> saying 'hello' just means "Pay attention to me for no reason"
[17:18:14] <xx> would be my philosophical viewpoint
[17:18:16] <xx> discuss
[17:18:51] <chatguy> it's just a greeting. a conventional way to greet others and perhaps start a conversation
[17:19:02] <chatguy> better than saying "how are you?" (if you don't care)

[17:19:25] <xx> is the hello
[17:19:29] <mannequin> how are you is a very common, honest a friendly welcome over here
[17:19:58] <chatguy> it's very common here too. i don't find it honest 99% of the time
[17:20:18] <chatguy> the cashier that says "how are you?" doesn't want to hear about my problems
[17:20:25] <chatguy> 99% of people don't
[17:20:30] <xx> I just ignore every 'how are you'
[17:20:38] <xx> and I never ask
[17:20:38] <chatguy> I ignore most of them now too
[17:20:49] <chatguy> I only ever ask if I genuinely want to know, which isn't often
[17:20:53] <xx> because truthfully, I don't care how people are
[17:20:57] <chatguy> of course
[17:20:59] <chatguy> no one does
[17:22:07] <chatguy> but i can say "hello" to them to greet them and acknowledge their existence
[17:22:29] <xx> why acknowledge their existence? They exist irrelevant of what you say
[17:22:38] <chatguy> because I'm polite and friendly
[17:22:46] <xx> politeness is just peer pressure
[17:22:51] <chatguy> it's my personal choice
[17:22:56] * xx doubts
[17:23:12] <chatguy> I treat others as I prefer to be treated
[17:23:16] <mannequin> in my society it depends who welcomes who
[17:23:16] <xx> I know very few people that actually do things out of their own personal choice
[17:23:32] <mannequin> sometimes someone goeas around the answer
[17:23:33] <xx> everyone else just does what's expected of them
[17:23:41] <mannequin> sometimes it's really ok
[17:23:56] <chatguy> I am not one to care much for expectations, or custom for the sake of custom
[17:23:59] <mannequin> sometimes it's no good and one can have will to talk about it
[17:24:36] <chatguy> but because I am authentic and articulate and engaging, some people find me charming
[17:24:56] <xx> "I treat others as I prefer to be treated" is a custom, not an original thought
[17:25:02] <chatguy> regardless of whether I am direct, blunt, controversial, of even arrogant
[17:25:02] <xx> it doesn't even make sense if you think about it more
[17:25:20] <chatguy> xx it's not a custom. it's an ethical principle known as the golden rule
[17:25:31] <chatguy> if the golden rule was custom the world would be a very different place
[17:26:00] <chatguy> it makes perfect sense if you have empathy
[17:26:32] <xx> empathy does not exist, it's something made up that everyone thinks everyone else has
[17:26:38] <xx> so they pretend to have it too
[17:26:43] <chatguy> I disagree

[17:29:44] <Lumine> Be careful
[17:29:45] <xx> should have worn the mask
[17:29:49] <pussipupu> Also empathy exists and most humans experience it
[17:30:35] <chatguy> pure sociopaths may deny the existence of empathy
[17:30:43] <xx> if most humans experienced it, the world would look very different
[17:30:53] <xx> like there wouldn't be a single war ever
[17:31:01] <xx> yet here we are
[17:31:03] <chatguy> but i understand that most people's "empathic" experience and action is not necessarily purely empathic and may be largely influenced by cultural conditioning and social expectation
[17:31:27] <chatguy> most humans are more sociopathic than empathic

[17:45:59] <Aidhan> I mean, just from looking at the word it would imply a disorder of the psyche, not necessarily a lack of
[17:47:10] *** Joins: gb73d (gb73d@host-92-7-42-10.as13285.net)
[17:47:48] <Aidhan> IIRC psychopathic behaviours include delusions, hallucinations, and other disjointed perceptions of reality
[17:48:46] <Aidhan> Never mind, thinking of psychosis
[17:51:47] <chatguy> psychopathy isn't emotionlessness at all. it's a lack of conscience and empathy, and usually narcissism and sadism
[17:52:17] <chatguy> hi gb73d
[18:06:09] <xx> psychopathy isn't even properly defined anywhere
[18:06:10] <chatguy> anyone here?
[18:06:20] <xx> psychologists avoid that term
[18:06:32] <chatguy> I'm providing my definition. You're free to disagree and provide an alternative
[18:06:42] <xx> I wouldn't bother defining it
[18:06:51] <xx> instead I'd just focus on the actual traits
[18:07:18] <chatguy> I think it's a useful term. It sums up a lot of traits into a single disposition.
[18:07:29] <xx> a single disposition that no human has
[18:07:32] <xx> hence irrelevant
[18:07:55] <xx> what do you call a human that only has 1 hand and also has 2 hands?
[18:08:21] <chatguy> i think the world is full of psychopaths, as i use the term
[18:09:27] <xx> if everyone is a psychopath, no one is
[18:09:47] <xx> would be more useful to instead view special emotional snowflakes as the deviation from the norm
[18:09:49] <chatguy> i didn't mean literally full
[18:09:59] <chatguy> you sound like you may be autistic or a sociopath yourself
[18:10:26] <xx> I've been tested and I'm fine. The psychiatrist was not a real professional in my opinion because they just said I'm an asshole at the end.
[18:10:27] <chatguy> (both common on iRC)
[18:10:44] <chatguy> I think most assholes are probably sociopaths of some degree
[18:11:40] <xx> asshole isn't a real diagnosis either
[18:11:50] <chatguy> indeed, it's a body part
[18:11:55] <xx> it was just a professional failure of the psychiatrist
[18:12:06] <chatguy> he may have been right, though
[18:12:28] <chatguy> but it doesn't sound like his assessment was very professional
[18:12:29] <xx> doubt it, they shouldn't have picked that profession if they can't handle people who won't buy into their bullshit
[18:12:49] <xx> any psychiatrist that ends up using insults is a failure
[18:13:07] <chatguy> depends if he was trying to be insulting or was just being flippant or colloquial
[18:13:34] <xx> that distinction wouldn't matter in any other medical profession
[18:13:56] <chatguy> well, i think most doctors are sociopaths or incompetents
[18:14:06] <chatguy> so such distinctions don't mean much to me
[18:14:14] <xx> sounds like you think the whole world is against you and is full of psychopaths/sociopaths/...
[18:14:51] <chatguy> the whole world is not against me. but i think most people are sociopaths to a degree. it's a matter of how it manifests
[18:14:59] <chatguy> we are all on a spectrum
[18:15:18] <chatguy> and many common human behaviours and customs are sociopathic
[18:16:00] <xx> wouldn't be a 'pathy' if it is a common behavior
[18:16:28] <chatguy> i disagree. also, i doubt human attitudes are common throughout the universe
[18:16:48] <xx> human attitudes are only common on earth
[18:16:52] <chatguy> but i don't accept that normality or majority or consensus has any truth value
[18:17:08] <chatguy> and I consider earth a kind of hell realm
[18:17:18] <xx> I prefer to view humans as they are, instead of seeing them as I'd like them to be
[18:17:25] <chatguy> that's what I'm doing
[18:17:43] <xx> seems like you're applying some values to them though
[18:17:52] <chatguy> values?
[18:18:16] <xx> i.e. you compare them to how you'd like them to be, which is different from just seeing them as they are
[18:18:30] <chatguy> well, I certainly don't enjoy most humans
[18:18:34] <chatguy> I have needs
[18:18:37] <chatguy> and preferences
[18:18:51] <chatguy> but that doesn't mean I'm not seeing others as they are
[18:18:59] <chatguy> I'm seeing them as they are, and it is profoundly disappointing
[18:19:09] <chatguy> for me, anyway
[18:19:16] <chatguy> you may have all your emotional needs met, etc.
[18:19:42] <xx> why would you be profoundly disappointed that an ant walks in a straight line?
[18:19:51] <chatguy> because i have needs
[18:19:59] <xx> you don't have needs
[18:20:11] <chatguy> all humans have needs
[18:20:18] <xx> no humans have needs
[18:20:24] <xx> they just have desires
[18:20:44] <chatguy> I disagree. we have physical and psychological needs. and that is not a controversial perspective
[18:20:53] <chatguy> it's basically psychology 101
[18:21:12] <chatguy> if you don't understand that then I suggest you are in denial or you have your needs met and just don't realise it
[18:21:44] <xx> earlier you said that you don't care about what's popular, so why would you suddenly care about this being a popular opinion (by not being a controversial perspective)
[18:22:05] <xx> be consistent
[18:22:45] <chatguy> it's not a matter of me "caring". it's a matter of me informing you that my position on this issue is entirely accepted. therefore, if you disagree then you'll need to make a strong case.
[18:22:54] <chatguy> because i'm not saying anything that any psychologist would disagree with
[18:23:19] <xx> so you're invoking other people, while saying you don't care about other people's opinions? :)
[18:23:48] <chatguy> my perspective is based on my own experience. doubtless most psychologists and most people in general would agree with me based on their personal experience too
[18:24:24] <chatguy> you are disagreeing with me and I suggest pretty much the whole world. so please present your case and we'll consider it
[18:24:25] <xx> stop hiding behind what most would agree with
[18:24:57] <chatguy> you are an anti-social person. (I don't use the term 'asshole' much;)  )
[18:25:16] <chatguy> but i am aware that IRC is full of antisocial people
[18:25:18] <chatguy> that's why they are here
[18:25:20] <xx> I'd prefer the term pro-human-extinction person
[18:25:35] <chatguy> I suggest you are in a great deal of denial about a great many things
[18:25:42] <chatguy> probably sitting on a mountain of suppressed rage
[18:25:49] <xx> denial is not a real thing either
[18:26:00] <chatguy> keep telling yourself that, brother

[18:32:48] <chatguy> you must live in a psychotic society too then
[18:32:59] <iryith> why psychotic?
[18:33:15] <chatguy> shutting down society is psychotic
[18:33:40] <iryith> I live in a smaller city, the hospitals were getting completely overrun. They had to reduce the spread
[18:33:50] <chatguy> it's psychotic for those who agree with it. and psychopathic for those who plan it
[18:34:09] <iryith> again, the hospital was not able to cope
[18:34:11] <chatguy> well i think there are other ways to address such things
[18:34:17] <iryith> like what?
[18:34:27] <chatguy> i'll give you a few options
[18:34:41] <chatguy> (1) spend some of the trillions on building more hospitals
[18:34:49] <chatguy> (2) make early treatments available
[18:35:04] <chatguy> (3) educate people about natural prophylaxis
[18:35:12] <chatguy> (4) make hospital tents if necessary
[18:35:14] <iryith> (1) -- Takes way too much time. The hospital surges are on the order of weeks. Building a new hospital takes years
[18:35:18] <chatguy> (5) don't fire staff
[18:35:28] <iryith> (2) early treatments of what?
[18:35:50] <iryith> (3) people are refusing vaccinations, I dont' think 'educating' them would help much
[18:35:54] <chatguy> i think u'll find that in the usa (if that's where u are) that there have been hospital issues for a long time. so this isn't exactly a new problem. the system is already broken
[18:36:10] <iryith> (4) hospital tents are not exactly sterile or nice places to try to treat patients
[18:36:14] <chatguy> (2) monoclonals, ivermectin, not "go home and get sicker"
[18:36:26] <chatguy> vaccinations are not the way out of a pandemic
[18:36:28] <iryith> (5) the firing of any staff is negligible for any treatment procedures needed
[18:36:38] <chatguy> especially not leaky vaccines with serious side effects
[18:36:44] <iryith> vaccinations are the way to keep people out of the hospital at a larger rate
[18:37:15] <chatguy> iryith hospital tents were used in 2018 for flu patients. hospitals are not exactly safe places either. but you do what you gotta do. sterility is overrated.
[18:37:49] <iryith> regardless, if you have more people getting sick from being out in society as normal you will have more dead
[18:38:04] <chatguy> that didn't happen in sweden
[18:38:06] <chatguy> or in japan
[18:38:18] <iryith> the first wave in sweden killed a lot of the elderly
[18:38:26] <iryith> the later waves weren't as impactful because the weak had already died
[18:38:38] <chatguy> that's why you do focused protection
[18:38:46] <chatguy> not lockdowns
[18:38:48] <iryith> like keeping some people out of society?
[18:39:02] *** Quits: sweetsymph (uid509475@id-509475.lymington.irccloud.com) ()
[18:39:05] <chatguy> like protecting the vulnerable and letting everyone else get on with life
[18:39:15] <chatguy> that is the sane response that has been accepted for decades
[18:39:19] <chatguy> there is no science behind lockdowns
[18:39:24] <chatguy> they don't work
[18:39:26] <chatguy> they destroy societies
[18:39:38] <iryith> they worked really well here to keep the hospital admission under control
[18:40:05] <chatguy> at what cost?
[18:40:24] <chatguy> you could have given people early treatment and prevented the need for hospital admissions
[18:40:28] <chatguy> without destroying millions of lives
[18:40:40] <xx> destroying societies was necessary, because otherwise we'd never move onto online that quickly. Online work, online school, online doctor checkups, online everything.
[18:40:47] <chatguy> you could also have advised people about other basic preventions
[18:40:58] <iryith> they did educate people about preventions
[18:41:05] <iryith> masks/hand sanitizer, etc.
[18:41:27] <chatguy> not about vitamin-d, losing weight, getting proper nutrition, or about easily accessible prophylaxis such as ivermectin
[18:41:30] <chatguy> and other protocols
[18:41:46] <xx> but that would mean that more people would survive
[18:41:57] <iryith> here they promoted all of those things, except ivermectin
[18:42:05] <xx> every country suffers from overpopulation already
[18:42:11] <iryith> co-morbidities were highlighted quite strongly
[18:42:12] <chatguy> i have never seen any such promotions
[18:42:24] <iryith> just because you haven't seen them doesn't mean they don't exist
[18:42:43] <iryith> I live on the other side of the world than you, so
[18:42:58] <chatguy> can you give me an example of a single press conference or program wherein it was advised for people to take more vitamin d and for obese people to lose weight?
[18:43:41] <xx> can't do that in the west, that'd be fatphobia
[18:43:44] <xx> but it was done in japan
[18:43:53] <iryith> I can try to find some in Norwegian
[18:43:55] <chatguy> japan is much more sane than many other countries
[18:44:01] <iryith> my work was putting them out on the regular
[18:44:44] <iryith> many of the companies here (mine included) actually had 30 minute exercise teams meetings every day and have promoted weight loss and proper nutrition
[18:44:52] <chatguy> iryith and does your work include doing an assessment of all the social, medical, educational, economic, and other consequences of lockdowns?
[18:45:05] <iryith> chatguy, of course not, that's not their job, is it?
[18:45:13] <iryith> that's for the government to sort out
[18:45:19] <chatguy> well if you're going to advocate for lockdowns then you should know the cost-benefit analysis
[18:45:28] <iryith> they didn't advocate for it, it was a national mandate
[18:45:38] <chatguy> and the mandate is insane
[18:45:42] <chatguy> based on no science
[18:45:45] <iryith> that's your opinion, sure
[18:45:49] <chatguy> and no cost-benefit analysis
[18:45:57] <chatguy> then show me the government cost-benefit analysis
[18:46:12] <chatguy> i'm sure if they made their decisions based on a comprehensive assessment of all factors then they would make that public
[18:46:30] <chatguy> where are those policy assessment documents?
[18:46:37] <iryith> even if the lockdowns were proven to be not as effective as they wanted, they still had to try something because it was spreading at an incredible rate, killing lots of people, and flooding hospitals
[18:46:40] <iryith> hindsight is always 20/20
[18:47:13] <chatguy> no. lockdowns were rejected as a feasible means of pandemic control. they have not been part of policy for decades.
[18:47:19] <chatguy> focused protection was policy
[18:47:32] <iryith> of course it wasn't poart of policy because we haven't experienced anything like this in the past few decades, have we?
[18:47:36] <chatguy> I refer you to the Great Barrington Declaration
[18:47:50] <chatguy> countries and the WHO have had pandemic policies in place for decades
[18:48:01] <chatguy> these scenarios have been considered and studied for decades
[18:48:36] <chatguy> you work in healthcare and aren't aware of this?
[18:48:39] <iryith> yeah, that's fine. Policies like this need to be flexible to the reality of the current situation
[18:48:44] <iryith> who said I work in healthcare?
[18:49:03] <chatguy> I assumed you worked in healthcare if you knew what was happening in hospitals
[18:49:10] <iryith> why would you assume that?
[18:49:21] <iryith> I read the news and have friends that are nurses
[18:49:28] <chatguy> you seemed to know exactly what was going on in hospitals and in terms of advising the public
[18:49:32] <chatguy> lol you read the news
[18:49:37] <iryith> ah, so you're one of those people
[18:49:38] <iryith> ok
[18:49:55] <chatguy> i'm one of those people that understand mainstream media is propaganda
[18:50:01] <iryith> you're a strawman creator
[18:50:04] <chatguy> corporations owned by special interests
[18:50:09] <chatguy> e.g. pharma
[18:50:11] <iryith> that's fine, I'll leave you to rant
[18:50:19] <chatguy> these are just facts
[18:50:31] <chatguy> you seem unaware of alternative perspectives such as the Great Barrington Declaration
[18:50:31] * iryith pats you on the head
[18:50:46] <chatguy> this is not a rationale response
[18:51:19] <chatguy> i suggest you expose yourself to perspectives of doctors, nurses, scientists, and other professionals (e.g. epidemiologists) who question and challenge the mainstream narrative
[18:51:23] <chatguy> you might learn something
[18:51:32] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o litharge
[18:51:32] *** litharge sets mode: -bo $a:SolarAquarion$##fix_your_connection litharge
[18:53:03] <chatguy> a mature and rational mind is open to discussion and learning new things and considering new perspectives
[18:53:18] <iryith> and yet you are not open to discussion and learning new things
[18:53:23] <iryith> fun how that works
[18:53:55] <chatguy> i'm here talking. i'm not patting you on the head. i'm referring you to an alternative view by eminent epidemiologists
[18:54:01] <chatguy> cosigned by thousands of professionals
[18:54:07] <iryith> and I'm telling you the reality of what happened in my city
[18:54:22] <chatguy> based on the news and some nurses
[18:54:26] <iryith> see?
[18:54:36] <iryith> maybe read your sentence another time and try again
[18:54:54] <chatguy> the news is people sitting in front of a teleprompter
[18:55:02] <chatguy> and nurses only know what they are told
[18:55:05] <iryith> yeah, I'm not going to be your muse for an impotent rant
[18:55:16] <chatguy> I'm not ranting. You don't know what ranting is
[18:55:41] <chatguy> I suggest you read the Great Barrington Declaration. it's available online. created by three eminent epidemiologists
[18:55:56] <chatguy> and cosigned by thousands of professionals in relevant fields
[18:56:45] <chatguy> that is just one of many examples of statements by groups of serious professionals who disagree with what you have been saying
[18:57:15] <chatguy> indeed, many nurses and many doctors of nursing also disagree
[18:57:28] <chatguy> as do many doctors and scientists
[18:57:59] <chatguy> if you don't expose yourself to what such experienced and expert minds are saying then you won't see any problem with what you are consuming in mainstream media
[18:58:21] <chatguy> or hearing from nurses or others who themselves have not questioned anything (because most people don't question things)

[19:00:57] <chatguy> the fact you haven't even heard of the Great Barrington Declaration suggests to me that you have not exposed yourself to any views outside the mainstream narrative
[19:01:52] <chatguy> you will notice that I have made you angry. which has in turn led you to be condescending, etc. this is not a mature or healthy response to discussion about an important topic
[19:02:01] <chatguy> this is an immature and emotional reaction on your part, brother
[19:02:21] <iryith> you haven't made me angry at all, i'm just letting you fight against your windmills
[19:03:07] <chatguy> well, based on some of your statements I'd say you are angry or emotionally reactive to what I have said. this is very common
[19:03:13] <iryith> not at all
[19:03:27] <iryith> although your insistence about being able to affect my mood means you think way too highly of yourself
[19:03:45] <chatguy> well, in your sober mindedness I hope you peruse the Great Barrington Declaration website and expose yourself to at least that alternative view
[19:04:10] <iryith> I understand the alternatives, and part of that idea is being played out right now here in Norway. The cases of covid are through the roof but they are opening up society again
[19:04:29] <chatguy> covid cases are a meaningless concept
[19:04:37] *** Quits: Rashad (~textual@2a01:9700:1a6a:3800:218a:13cc:5e61:365b) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[19:04:54] <iryith> ok
[19:05:03] <chatguy> society should never have been closed down is the point. and you can't provide a single document showing your government's assessment of costs and benefits
[19:05:10] <chatguy> what is a covid case? can you provide a definition?
[19:05:13] <chatguy> (i'm being sincere)
[19:05:35] <chatguy> do you know what the definition of that term is?
[19:05:35] <iryith> I'm sorry, i missed the point where I needed to prove my governmental response to you
[19:05:57] <iryith> if you think the response was not appropriate, perhaps bring it up with someone that was involved in the decisions?
[19:06:03] <chatguy> if you can't provide any evidence that your government has done a cost-benefit analysis then the idea that you trust your government's response is incredibly naive
[19:06:28] <chatguy> but back to my question about covid cases
[19:06:40] <iryith> no thanks
[19:06:42] <chatguy> what is your definition of a covid case? do you know what that term means? (with all respect)
[19:07:04] <chatguy> because if you don't know what a covid case is (or how that term is defined) then I don't know if you really know what you're talking about
[19:07:04] <iryith> I don't feel this need to define and defend every decision made in a crisis to you
[19:07:06] <chatguy> or what is happening
[19:07:17] <chatguy> okay so you don't know
[19:07:20] <iryith> I don't have the full information, nor do you
[19:07:25] <chatguy> that's okay. i'm not being aggressive or judging you
[19:07:30] <iryith> yes you are, don't be glib
[19:07:45] <chatguy> no, I'm trying to help you understand that your view on this is incredibly distorted
[19:07:46] <iryith> which is exactly why I'm exiting this conversation
[19:07:54] <chatguy> that is not reasonable or mature
[19:08:02] <iryith> i agree, your response is not reasonable or mature
[19:08:10] <iryith> have a nice morning :)
[19:08:15] <chatguy> I'm happy to explain this to you if you like
[19:08:23] <chatguy> It's an important topic
[19:08:59] <chatguy> I do hope that you allow yourself to have open and in-depth conversations about it with people who hold alternative views
[19:09:12] <chatguy> I think open and sincere discussion is vital with regard to important topics
[19:09:36] <chatguy> that is how we learn
[19:10:28] <chatguy> and knowing something as basic as the definition of a "covid case" is incredibly important in understanding this topic
[19:10:53] <chatguy> your ego is reacting to what I'm saying. that is all. because you have a certain fixed view of things
[19:11:03] <chatguy> but you don't have to react like this

[19:16:31] <chatguy> good to see you. what's going on?
[19:19:13] <Jong> I'm trying to find the name of the thing used to drain water from rice
[19:20:23] <chatguy> a strainer
[19:21:13] <Jong> thanks!
[19:21:23] <Ungwelian> What !
[19:21:33] <Ungwelian> No no no, rice isn't made like this.
[19:22:08] <Ungwelian> You boil the water into the rice, and it won't have to be drained.
[19:22:24] <Ungwelian> Overly watered drained rice just becomes soggy.
[19:22:41] <Ungwelian> You must not do this. This is a culinary crime.
[19:22:54] <iryith> oh, rice for dinner sounds like a good idea though
[19:23:27] <chatguy> Jong u do what u gotta do
[19:23:33] <Ungwelian> Get a rice cooker if it feels difficult. Those are around for just a few tens of bucks.
[19:23:40] <chatguy> i strain water from rice because i soak brown rice before cooking it
[19:24:03] <Jong> actually, I'm going to use it juice out lemons without getting seeds in my cup
[19:24:22] <chatguy> and you drain the soaking water before cooking, because it contains chemicals that interfere with digestion
[19:25:04] <chatguy> that's what should be done with all seeds and pods and legumes

[19:28:40] <assan> what was he preaching about?
[19:28:45] <chatguy> if you think I am ranting and preaching then you don't know the definition of those words, just as you don't know the definition of a covid case

[19:30:38] <iryith> go nuts, chatguy
[19:30:44] <chatguy> assan can you recommend any better channels?
[19:31:05] <chatguy> iryith a covid case is simply a positive pcr test, which is effectively meaningless
[19:31:17] <chatguy> it doesn't mean someone who is sick or even infectious
[19:31:52] <chatguy> it means someone who had a + rt-pcr test with a usually unknown or unspecified cycle threshold
[19:31:59] <chatguy> which is just meaningless
[19:32:15] <assan> ummm chatguy right now libera is just not picked up yet best you can get for now is rizon from what i know best

[19:37:35] <chatguy> we can talk in there if you prefer
[19:37:40] <assan> sure
[19:44:17] <chatguy> iryith in short, ppl who talk of 'covid cases' (including the mainstream media) usually have no idea what they're talking about. and this shows just how easy it is to fool entire populations. this is why the current 'pandemic' has been classified by Belgian psychologist Mattias Desmet as a case of Mass Formation
[19:45:45] <iryith> ok
[19:45:55] <chatguy> those who are victims of the mass formation will be psychologically resistant to new or contrary information, regardless of its source (even if the source is highly credentialed experts in their field)
[19:47:46] <chatguy> about 30% of people will be victims of the mass formation. about 30% will see through it. and about 40% will be in the middle but will go along with the mass formation out of convenience
