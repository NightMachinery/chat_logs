[01:35:51] <Caterpillar> do you know which mysql community package provides type my_bool for C language programming? I have installed  mysql-8.0.28-1.el8.x86_64.rpm-bundle.tar     mysql-connector-c++-8.0.28-1.el8.x86_64.rpm            but I still get compilation error   error: unknown type name ‘my_bool’; did you mean ‘bool’?
[02:21:27] <Xgc> Caterpillar: "The my_bool type was used before MySQL 8.0. As of MySQL 8.0, use the bool or int C type instead."
[02:24:06] <Caterpillar> Xgc: but it has been reintroduced in 8.0.2   https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=87337
[02:28:51] <Caterpillar> this simple sql file https://paste.centos.org/view/bd269bea when imported into mysql 8.0.28, triggers error         ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 5: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'IF NOT EXISTS `testdb`.`get_return_value_test`(IN a INT, IN b INT, OUT result IN' at line 1              what should I change? MaraDB works well with it
[02:29:27] <Xgc> Caterpillar: Show the documentation link.  It could be wrong.  Your distribution seems to suggest it's still removed.
[02:30:41] <Caterpillar> Xgc: thank you but for the moment I will just use regular bool and see if it works as expected. Now I am trying to fix the SQL file problem I mentioned before
[02:38:35] <Xgc> Caterpillar: Remove the IF NOT EXISTS ...  Report the bug in the documentation.  It's not supported.
[02:38:53] <Xgc> Caterpillar: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_8.0&fiddle=395aa54697facec7f96ad49d0a9fa5bd
[02:40:00] <Xgc> Caterpillar: DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ...;  is probably fine.  But the other is not.
[02:40:20] <Caterpillar> Xgc: ok, so I should fill a bugreport that concerns the documentation right?
[02:41:38] <Xgc> Caterpillar: One or the other is wrong.  You can just report that the actual behavior does not match the documentation.  Let the reviewer decide if that is a documentation problem or the IF NOT EXISTS  is really intended to be supported.
[02:43:52] <Xgc> Caterpillar: "This option is supported with both CREATE FUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE beginning with MySQL 8.0.29."
[02:44:03] <Xgc> Caterpillar: Which version are you using?
[02:44:15] <Caterpillar> Xgc: 8.0.28
[02:44:35] <Xgc> There ya go.  Get the next version when it's available to you.
[02:45:00] <Caterpillar> mmh I will try to move from RHEL to Fedora, so maybe there is the newer version available for such distro
