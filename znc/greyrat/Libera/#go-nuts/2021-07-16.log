[02:04:11] <zsnes> i swear i'm not making it up :P
[02:04:34] <quippy> yeah Tv_ I am definitely breaking the unit testing paradigm a little bit, basically I want some tests that can be toggled by developers (and have them be warned that the tests are off, if they are) because they rely on an external service that will be present in CI and /may/ be present on their machines, but also might not be
[02:04:51] <Tv_> quippy: skipped tests are counted separately
[02:05:04] <Tv_> quippy: and t.Skip takes a message

[02:05:14] <quippy> right but t.Skip doesn't output the message unless the test fails
[02:05:22] <quippy> I just tested this
[02:05:30] <Tv_> quippy: yes, only a summary is shown unless you ask for -v
[02:05:32] <quippy> although zsnes has me feeling like I'm taking crazy pills
[02:05:40] <Tv_> quippy: but they're not seen as passing
[02:05:52] <quippy> right, so I explicitly want a message shown even if the test isn't called with -v
[02:06:18] <quippy> it probably doesn't matter very much, I think I'm just going to rewrite the test so that it fails and yells at the developer if they don't have the external thing
[02:06:26] <Tv_> quippy: that's starting to sound like you just want the tests to fail
[02:06:38] <quippy> well, right, that's sort of the conclusion I've come to since I first posed the question

[02:08:19] <quippy> I'm basically only killing myself over this for the sake of developer ergonomics lmao, which is why I think you're probably right when you say that I actually might just want the test to fail
[02:09:06] <dante443> Obvious and dumb question I am sure, but if I call a single threaded python program from a goroutine, it would run with concurrency? Any non-obvious implications to doing this?
[02:09:19] *** Joins: batdog (batdog@lnsq.elkins.co)
[02:09:34] <quippy> in order to execute the Python interpreter you'll have to spawn it in a new process
[02:10:03] <dante443> Is that something exec would handle automatically or I have to configure it to do so
[02:10:08] <quippy> that's what exec does
[02:10:21] <quippy> and then your goroutine can manage the process in parallel to the main thread of your Go program if you choose
[02:10:49] *** Joins: ray (~ray@user/re)
[02:10:51] <dante443> Nice, okay thanks some of my low-level knowledge is lacking, appreciate it
[02:10:54] <quippy> and multi-process Python programs are actually pretty common since Python doesn't have (good) threading (or didn't the last time I wrote it seriously which has been awhile, so I apologize if this is wrong info)
[02:11:34] <dante443> Yeah, that's my understanding as well
[02:12:36] <dante443> Considering some funky architecture for my next project and it seems like a go application "orchestrator" to python apps and/or other supporting apps might be the way to go
[02:13:18] <quippy> Go seems like a good choice for an orchestrator imho
[02:15:39] *** Quits: paulgrmn (~paulgrmn@user/paulgrmn) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[02:17:41] <bpalmer> The main limitation about python threading is just that (using the typical python implementations) the parallelism is limited for stuff in pure python, since there is a "global interpreter lock"
[02:18:27] <bpalmer> So you get parallel execution when, e.g., one thread is blocked on IO or off doing something in C, but you're not taking advantage of multiple cores while everything is still in python.
[02:19:21] <foobaz> it's not as bad as it used to be, you can get multiple cores involved now, but it's not great
[02:24:48] <foobaz> they don't want to fix it because it would break old python programs, many codebases would have to add explicit synchronization like with mutexes, and that's especially hard to do after the fact
[02:25:37] <foobaz> it would be interesting to build a new python interpreter without such limitations for new code development

[06:49:02] <blinux> echo $GOPATH returns: /home/username/go:/home/username/mygo. I have also tried with just one $GOPATH location. I read that $GOAPTH, like path, can have multiple locations and I could split my source into mygo, by doing this.

[06:59:54] <fizzie> Sounds like a combination of a tutorial that predates modules, and a Go version that defaults to having modules enabled.
[07:01:02] <b0nn> blinux: which version of Go are you using
[07:02:20] *** Quits: frost (~frost@59.71.241.179) (Quit: Connection closed)
[07:02:44] <b0nn> if you want to save hassle, then mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/fatih; cd $_; git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial
[07:06:01] <blinux> go version go1.16.5 linux/amd64
[07:06:14] <blinux> ok, I'll git clone there.
[07:07:15] <fizzie> There were a number of changes in 1.16 around modules (https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#go-command). The officially recommended way of organizing code no longer includes putting all your source code under $GOPATH.
[07:08:08] <fizzie> I guess that link should've been to https://blog.golang.org/go116-module-changes instead.
[07:09:21] <blinux> Do the modules effect the need for two gopath locations to seperate my source from package source?
[07:09:43] <blinux> "separate"
[07:10:04] <blinux> Because I read that idea somewhere else, not part of the vim-go tutorial site.
[07:11:18] <fizzie> In the sense that in module-aware mode, your code can be anywhere you want independently of whatever GOPATH may have been set to, yes.

[07:14:56] <blinux> Oh, wow, no GOPATH at all. in 1.17. The install at the website doesn't even mention setting up gopath I noticed.
[07:15:19] <blinux> It just says add /usr/local/go/bin to the $PATH
[07:15:43] <blinux> there is a $GOBIN env variable.
[07:16:37] <fizzie> You can still use GOPATH to relocate the module cache ($GOPATH/pkg/mod) and the default value for $GOBIN if you need to.
[07:16:47] <fizzie> It's just no longer related to where your source code is.

[14:42:28] <shibumi> Hi, I am implementing a go library for an API for sending and receiving REST API Calls. The sender part has been easy.. how would you implement the receiving part?

[14:44:31] <shiroyasha> eyJhb: I don't know how it's nowadays but I can tell you that, at least on 1.11.6, `go build` downloads dependencies even with `-mod=readonly`.

[14:47:49] <fizzie> FWIW, the way I see it, `go build` isn't a "compiler", it's a build system. It's not that uncommon for those to touch the network (Bazel does, to name just one example). The compiler is `go tool compile`.
[14:49:08] <shiroyasha> Interesting, I'll have to check that one out.

[17:26:57] <Sam> Uggh, just fixed an import loop with a magical hidden context-value argument. I feel dirty. But the public API is nice and clean now and there's only one implementation under the hood that doesn't require copy/pasting a massive amount of code between packages.
[17:27:22] <Sam> So on the surface it's all shiny and nice and it's now infinitely more maintainable without creating import loops.

[21:11:59] <Sam> There is no news on enums because that is not a feature being developed. There are no enums in go.
[21:13:52] <Sam> An empty struct is useful for a number of reasons. It is a comparable value that doesn't have any width (it takes up no memory) so you can use it as a context key, for example, or you may have a stateless implementation of an interface that doesn't store data, so you just want a type that has a bunch of methods but needs no fields, or you might use it as the value in a map and now you basically have a set ins
[21:13:52] <Sam> tead. Lots of good uses :)
[21:13:55] <zsnes> you can simulate enums with typed constants and iota
[21:14:21] <ikke> Yes, but it's not airtight
[21:19:11] <zsnes> in what way, out of curiosity?
[21:19:46] <ikke> You can assign any literal to it
[21:19:54] <ikke> (of the same base type)
[21:24:20] <ikke> zsnes: https://play.golang.org/p/0idxfPq9q8j
[21:25:28] <fizzie> You can simulate enums by that thing where you have an interface with a non-exported method, so that only types defined in the same package can implement it, but it gets a little ridiculous.
[21:25:57] <dan01> So enums are not possible due to untyped constants

[21:26:05] <bpalmer> you can also simulate enums with interfaces and a sentinel method

[21:32:12] <zsnes> ikke: oh i didn't realize that, whats the point of typing it then
[21:32:53] <zsnes> well i guess you can still write methods on that type and such, nm
