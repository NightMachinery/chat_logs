[06:23:34] <LibertyDillo> ah right
[06:24:04] <morlog> think it would probably take 40 or 50 years to catalogue the records in that place for online sales
[06:24:24] <murthy> macrobat: The laws abolishes government subsidies and other government involvement in the farm sector and makes it WTO comparable. Also FDA friendly.

[06:55:57] <LibertyDillo> still have some 1/2 Speed Mastered from the 70s
[06:56:50] <LibertyDillo> need to get a new cartridge for my 1976 Technics magnetic drive

[06:58:34] <morlog> yeah
[06:58:44] <morlog> i think there may be one here
[06:59:03] <morlog> there are a lot of vitage record players and stereos here

[07:00:07] <morlog> there is one here
[07:00:18] <LibertyDillo> I think they used bamboo for the stylus 
[07:00:32] <morlog> i dont know
[07:00:42] <LibertyDillo> as I recall
[07:01:02] <LibertyDillo> in that case, the stylus wore out before the record
[07:01:10] <morlog> id like to get it working but im pretty sure it would depreciate the value
[07:01:54] <morlog> it needs its mechanism cleaned as well as belts and probably a stylus
[07:02:02] <LibertyDillo> great 19th century tech
[07:02:08] <morlog> yeah

[10:36:26] <Panther> Biden received a routine colonoscopy Friday while at Walter Reed. The process, which required anesthesia, meant that he temporarily transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman to assume presidential power for 85 minutes Friday morning.
[10:37:41] <Panther> I never had that, but I did have a scope down my throat, and I am glad they knocked me out for it.

[23:24:37] <Panther> Today, we present a special matinee.. a film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1966 -- and my personal favorite film of all time --  while the cast and crew won another five, including Best Director for Zinnemann and Best Actor for Scofield. It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama and the BAFTA Awards for Best Film and Best British Film. In 1999, the 
[23:24:37] <Panther> British Film Institute named it the 43rd greatest British film of all time. We present 'A Man For All Seasons' with Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller, Robert Shaw, Susannah York, and Orson Welles. Also appearing are Nigel Davenport, Leo McKern, Corin Redgrave, Vanessa Redgrave and, in one of his earliest screen roles, John Hurt.
