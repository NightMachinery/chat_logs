[00:00:41] <__adrian> but was also referring to end quality, reliability/support, etc.
[00:11:12] <biberu> relipse: if you're talking about e.g. reinventing a wiki i'd suspect that'd involve a lot of time spent on things that isn't effective for training, might be better to pick specific parts of it to focus on
[00:11:37] <relipse> I chose to do it using flat files
[00:11:46] <relipse> was a nice experience
[00:11:56] <biberu> what did you learn?
[00:12:21] <Albright_> Hopefully that databases are usually better than flat files
[00:17:38] <relipse> databases are better for updating passwords of users
[00:17:59] <relipse> rather than file_get_contents() and file_put_contents()
[00:18:09] <relipse> i probably should have used a lock or something
[00:28:44] <Sammitch> wow those last 3 messages damaged my sanity
[00:29:38] <relipse> why's that
[00:29:48] <relipse> you have a better way to do it if you are constrainted to not using a db?
[00:30:32] <Sammitch> reject the constraint and use a DB, eg: sqlite.
[00:30:40] <__adrian> relipse: point is, that artifical constraint is is nonsense
[00:30:41] <relipse> yeah sqlite would have been nice

[00:39:18] <bytestream> what's the most graceful way to handle open_basedir restriction in effect warnings?
[00:39:34] <__adrian> heh. disable it
[00:40:10] <__adrian> otherwise, what's your alternative? if you can fix it, then check for the error and do the fix. if you can't, then you should throw.
[00:40:38] <__adrian> there's probably no reason to treat it differently than any other filesystem error
[00:41:10] <bytestream> not necessarily fatal in the case I'm using it, @ seems most graceful at the expense of hiding other warnings
[00:42:06] <bytestream> graceful perhaps the wrong word, cleanest :p
[00:42:28] <Sammitch> like putting a piece of electrical tape over the "check engine" light in your car
[00:44:15] <__adrian> @ is not for ignoring. it's for handling in an alternative way.

[00:44:46] <bytestream> what do you mean by that? lol
[00:44:53] <__adrian> @fopen(...)  // no
[00:45:25] <__adrian> $fh = @fopen(...); if ($fh === false) { throw ...; }  // yes
[00:45:53] <bytestream> yeah only negative is you lose the warnings/notices
[00:46:07] <__adrian> think of @ as the "i'll do the error myself" operator rather than "error suppression."
[00:46:09] <bytestream> thinking if (! empty(ini_get('open_basedir')) return '???'; is the best way to go
[00:46:33] <__adrian> "bytestream> yeah only negative is you lose the warnings/notices"  // if you want the warning/notice... why @ at all?
[00:46:51] <stenno\OK> i used @ recently
[00:46:56] <__adrian> "bytestream> thinking if() is the best way to go"  // why?
[00:47:25] <bytestream> it suppresses the specific open_basedir warning, and still allows others to be thrown
[00:47:28] <__adrian> open_basedir being enabled doesn't tell you anything about whether a particular file operation will work.
[00:47:43] * stenno\OK non-sequitur
[00:47:53] <__adrian> why do you need to treat open_basedir differently?
[00:48:43] <__adrian> (also, fopen() failing when open_basedir is enabled doesn't mean open_basedir was the cause)
[00:49:44] <bytestream> I see your point, so there is no perfect solution
[00:50:03] <__adrian> there's likely a good solution, but it depends on your problem
[00:50:05] <__adrian> why do you need to treat open_basedir differently?
[00:50:32] <bytestream> warning currently bubbles up to a fatal errorexception when it should be gracefully handled

[00:50:44] <__adrian> "gracefull" how?
[00:50:47] <__adrian> *y
[00:51:06] <__adrian> your example of  return '???';  is certainly not "graceful"
[00:51:23] <bytestream> it's a simple function, imagine "detectServerType" which does stuff like is_dir('/usr/local/cpanel') etc
[00:51:34] <__adrian> ok
[00:51:35] <bytestream> each is_dir throws warnings when open_basedir is in effect
[00:51:47] <bytestream> I am happy to ignore said warning
[00:51:48] <__adrian> so the use case is "I can't check"?
[00:51:54] <bytestream> pretty much
[00:52:17] <__adrian> is that a problem? or are you happy to just say "yes"/"no" as a default?
[00:52:36] <bytestream> it would just return no in that case
[00:52:58] <bytestream> eventually fall through to "Unknown"
[00:53:00] <__adrian> then it's _not_ an error that you aren't able to check. correct?
[00:53:40] <bytestream> it's only an error that i can check if I catch the ErrorException and inspect the message
[00:54:45] <__adrian> "... if I catch the ErrorException"  yeah, i remember this fad. and still have to deal with it sometimes. tip: handling all errors by throwing them as ErrorException is The Wrong Idea™.
[00:55:18] <__adrian> right up there with  "use stdClass instead of arrays so it's OOP"
[00:55:22] <bytestream> you can take that up with Laravel :p
[00:55:37] <__adrian> i don't care to  :)
[00:55:51] <bytestream> good cause they don't often listen ;)
[00:56:56] <__adrian> so yes, in that case, you might @. i could also imagine your wanting a -vvv mode that notes why the determination was/wasn't made
[00:58:57] <bytestream> yeh think I'll go with that

[11:08:38] <TinoDidriksen> Ah
[11:09:36] <CoJaBo> It's like someone specifically sat down and decided, "Ok. I'm gonna write this in the most wrongest way possible, just to taunt CoJaBo."

[11:17:02] <CoJaBo> Hilariously, yes. It ran literally eighty-six vigintillion times faster.
[11:18:05] <CoJaBo> It's a keyspace-search type problem, that was implemented in a straightforward but rather naïve way
[11:19:15] <Naktibalda> looks like floating point rounding error to me :)
[11:20:15] <Naktibalda> 1 billion years to 1 nanosecond optimization is only 18 orders of magtinude.

[12:21:45] <bodom> Hi there! I need to run untrusted scripts in my PHP web app. At first i've been looking at eval(), but it looks like i cannot "jail" the eval'd script. The i've been looking into php-lua, but it seems scarcely used and documented and looks like i cannot disable features there too. Did anybody here had a similar challenge? How did you solve it?
[12:25:11] <AllenJB> I believe the safest way to run untrusted code would be in a container or VM. I believe this is what sites like https://3v4l.org do (see https://3v4l.org/about , in particular the 1st paragraph under "Backend")
[12:28:03] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[12:28:04] <AllenJB> 2nd para, not 1st
[12:28:40] <AllenJB> It might help if you explained why you're running untrusted code / what you're trying to achieve overall
[12:33:48] <bodom> Thanks, that's interesting. He is using a VM, so i've still been able, by example, to write in a file and read it later. Still not as much confined as i would like to.

[12:36:45] <Naktibalda> stutz: not a PHP error
[12:36:49] <stutz> I know :)
[12:37:03] <Naktibalda> could be anything, show your code
[12:37:15] <stutz> but since it happens on 8.1 but not on 8.0 I figured there MIGHT be a php related change affecting arrays that I am not aware of
[12:37:42] *** Joins: Miles8of9 (~obrien@93-34-145-79.ip50.fastwebnet.it)
[12:38:01] <Naktibalda> it seems that your code returns empty array
[12:38:26] <stutz> huh?
[12:38:51] <stutz> the array is the same (as shown in the kopy link)
[12:38:57] <stutz> or am I missing something important here?
[12:39:21] <Naktibalda> actual is [] and it has no partner=>test subarray
[12:42:07] <stutz> I am literally confused. we're either looking at a different snippet or I should step out for a sec cos L11-13 is the actual returned value which is definitely not empty because it says partner => test
[12:42:25] <AllenJB> bodom: There's already 3rd party systems such as PowerBI designed for allowing the business to build their own reports from / explore data. The other alternative I'd suggest is some sort of DSL - perhaps based on SQL - that essentially only provides readonly access to the original data with transformation / grouping capabilities
[12:42:40] <Naktibalda> stutz: then your parameters are in wrong order
[12:43:17] <Naktibalda> lines 11-13 is unsatisfied expectation

[12:45:14] * stutz walks away in shaame
[12:45:55] <stutz> sorry for the noise (also thanks for the rubber ducking Naktibalda)
[12:45:57] <bodom> AllenJB: i am not choosing a report system to buy/integrate, i am writing one from scratch ;) Do you know any of those DSL? I only know SQL; it's been my first tought, but giving the end user access to the DBMS seemed life an even worse idea than eval()
[12:47:01] <Naktibalda> bodom: have you considered using template engine for simple manipulations that you wanted to allow? like Smarty
[12:47:42] <AllenJB> bodom: And my first suggestion if you don't write such a thing from scratch if you don't need to
[12:48:07] <Naktibalda> {$row.amount|format:"%02d"}
[12:49:46] <bodom> Naktibalda: that's a good idea but smarty itself allows the execution of the whole PHP code and it is not meant to be safe for untrusted sources
[12:49:51] <biberu> bodom: do your users know sql?
[12:50:21] *** Joins: mujo (~ioh@c-73-25-160-104.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[12:50:33] <Naktibalda> bodom: IIRC {php} tags can be disabled and you have control of what functions are allowed
[12:50:44] <bodom> biberu: yes. they'll get to learn whatever i choose
[12:50:53] <AllenJB> bodom: If you wanted to use SQL directly, you could set up a specific user that has limited (readonly) access only to certain tables. But you could also consider using an SQL parser to essentially create a DSL that's a limited subset of SQL and works with a fake schema (and you can then also hide that actual DB structure, which may change over time
[12:50:53] <AllenJB> , from the reporting)
[12:51:14] <biberu> bodom: if so perhaps they could just use that and run queries against a bi database with read only capabilities?
[12:51:43] <biberu> (you probably don't want them to run it against the regular db since they might cause performance issues, locking etc.)
[12:52:36] <mujo> So I'm using pdo for interacting with a mariadb, using php7.0 and I have a SELECT query that takes around a minute to run. The thing is, I run the query and the function returns immediately with zero results, but the browser page says it is still loading for one minute. I can run the query manually and it works fine. What am I missing?
[12:53:24] <biberu> bodom: that'd also give you the option to remove sensitive or unneeded data from the regular set, optimize it for bi queries etc.
[12:53:25] <Naktibalda> mujo: do you see that SELECT query in the processlist?
[12:54:03] <mujo> Naktibalda: Let me check
[12:54:19] <stutz> what happened to
[12:54:29] <stutz> ##php anyway? the original #php gone?
[12:54:45] <bodom> Naktibalda, AllenJB, biberu: those are good hints, thanks. Running a partially disabled smarty - it could work, i'll lok into it. Writing my own langauge parser and executer (i would choose LUA in that case), takes some effort, but it could work too. Using a temporary db/user in the DBMS could work too, as long as i can find a way to disable some dangerous function (ie for filesystem access, import and export)
[12:55:01] <mujo> Naktibalda: Yes, I see it in the process list
[12:55:18] <Naktibalda> mujo: what's the status?
[12:55:21] <AllenJB> stutz: Freenode imploded and Libera has different channel naming rules that allow community channels to not use the double-#
[12:55:34] <biberu> bodom: if the user has to learn a new language either way you might save everyone a lot of trouble by not inventing one ;)
[12:55:49] <mujo> Naktibalda: there are two processes, one sleep with no status and the other the query with the state "Sending data"
[12:55:57] <bodom> biberu: ahahaha that's a good point
[12:56:00] <stutz> ah so new rules, gotcha. thanks
[12:56:37] <Naktibalda> mujo: have you tried to EXPLAIN that SELECT statement?
[12:56:38] <biberu> bodom: consider what'd happen if you need to make some changes to the syntax further down, for DSL 2.0, you might have a ton of reports to support on an old version already
[12:57:10] <mujo> Naktibalda: yeah, seems fine. If I run the select statement from the cli client, it runs and returns results as expected
[12:57:32] <biberu> bodom: with sql that's not an issue, and users could both learn from general sources, thus offloading you and your resources, and learn something that is valuable to them / the organization
[12:57:35] <Naktibalda> does it really run for a minute when executed by PHP?
[12:58:35] <mujo> Naktibalda: I mean, it sits in the processlist for that long, and the browser is in a "loading" state, but no results are shown.
[12:59:06] <AllenJB> mujo: What's the thread state when it "sits in the processlist"?
[12:59:09] <mujo> after a minute or so, the browser stops loading, the query leaves the process list, but no results
[12:59:26] *** Joins: guido (~guido@2001:b07:6455:ac4f:3641:5dff:fe55:2a8f)
[12:59:39] <mujo> The thread state is "Sending data" - though I check it by running "show processlist;" periodically
[13:00:24] <Naktibalda> is it possible that your PHP code runs that query many times in a loop?
[13:01:16] <mujo> Naktibalda: That's an interesting question. No, and if it did, I would see the process Id change when checking the processlist
[13:02:31] <mujo> It reminds me of non-blocking read that is returning too early
[13:04:50] <mujo> The sql is passed to pdo to be prepared, then executed, followed by a loop the does fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC) until it finishes
[13:05:51] <mujo> while ($row = $this->statement->fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) { $data[] = $row; }
[13:07:27] <Naktibalda> process id wouldn't change, because it is the same connection
[13:09:07] <AllenJB> I would profile the PHP code (which can be done on a basic level using microtime(true) and logging). Logging might also tell you if you're doing something like looping an unexpected number of times.
[13:11:41] <mujo> When I run this query manually via the mariadb cli client or in phpmyadmin, it takes a minute or so to run in anycase. Right now I'm just doing a var_dump($query_results) die(); after it's been called.
[13:12:15] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[13:13:02] <Naktibalda> so it is slow
[13:13:03] <mujo> The browser shows output from var_dump as 0 results, but the page continues to be in a loading state for approximately the length of time the query takes to run - and the query is viewable in the processlist during this time.
[13:13:07] <mujo> yeah
[13:13:58] <Naktibalda> then EXPLAIN SELECT and ask #mysql for optimization advice
[13:14:26] <mujo> :/ but I don't care that it's slow. Does php need queries to be fast?
[13:15:03] <Naktibalda> you came here because you care
[13:15:09] <mujo> I mean, I do care, but I'm working under the assumption it shouldn't matter here...
[13:15:16] <mujo> sorry for being flippant
[13:15:44] <Naktibalda> then it is working as expected
[13:16:32] <mujo> The speed is yes, but when run from my app it says there are zero results. But if I take the same statement and run it via the cli, then I get thousands - as expected. Sorry I must not have been describing my problem well
[13:17:02] <mujo> I'm expecting thousands of results, but when run in my php app, it acts like there are zero results
[13:17:20] <Naktibalda> then you really have to show your PHP code
[13:18:06] <Naktibalda> are you running it on the same database?
[13:18:47] <mujo> I'm able to duplicate the issue in a staging env and in production.
[13:19:09] <mujo> yes with the same db the app is connected to
[13:22:32] <mujo> I could copy a few key files somewhere but I don't think I can provide a running example - I'll just have to pull it out of the codebase I'm working on. Do you think that would be helpful?
[13:24:31] <Naktibalda> have you tried to dump in that fetch loop?
[13:24:50] <gde33> mujo: perhaps try a simple query?
[13:26:15] <mujo> those are both good ideas thanks! I assumed so many other queries run fine that it did not occur to me trim this specific one down. I'll also try to dump in the fetch loop - that is a very good idea

[17:05:00] <stenno> e.g. array_map tells me: the result will be another array with the same number of elements, map callback gets called for all elements, and the original array wont be mutated
[17:05:18] <stenno> i cannot derive this from a for-as loop

[17:06:13] <__adrian> arash: properties are available to class methods. however, _public_ methods in general are a code smell. you should declare properties, and they should usually be nonpublic.
[17:06:49] <__adrian> when they're public, you have little or no control over the value set. your class should _encapsulate_ (contain and control) those properties/values.
[17:06:57] <Naktibalda> public methods?
[17:07:03] <__adrian> properties
[17:11:02] <arash> I still don't see any reason to declare those properties before using them in my methods. I mean I didn't had any problem till now with using $this.
[17:11:45] <arash> my methods manipulate those properties.

[20:17:02] <__adrian> or against array_values($array).  "checking if key % 2 === 0" would only do what you're asking by accident
[20:17:20] <__adrian> yeah, don't count() every loop either

[20:17:55] <bizolos> thx

[20:18:08] <__adrian> just noticed that

[20:19:10] <__adrian> unless you _know_ that the array is already+always going to have 0..n keys

[20:19:40] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, the middle number slices first? That's profoundly odd.

[20:21:35] <TinoDidriksen> Yup yup, the :: syntax is an organic extension of : syntax. It's bad, but historically it makes sense.
[20:21:58] <bizolos> Why would it be bad? Real question, I'm curious. I find it very elegant.
[20:22:46] <bizolos> __adrian, in what sense? Except for the different api to use it? It seems to me that indexed arrays in PHP and lists in Python are quite similar
[20:23:01] *** Quits: rdbeni0 (~rdbeni0@public-gprs375585.centertel.pl) (Quit: Leaving.)
[20:23:03] <__adrian> "indexed array" doesn't mean what you seem to think it does
[20:23:05] <__adrian> all php arrays are associative. they are ordered, but [1] refers to the _key_ 1, not to the element's position.
[20:23:40] <bizolos> mmm interesting
[20:23:54] <__adrian> you can _treat_ a php array with [0..n] keys as a list, but it's not a list.
[20:25:11] <__adrian> e.g., if i gave you  [1=>0,1,2,5=>3,4,5,10=>7,8,9]  your function would not give you back the slice you expect.
[20:26:01] <bizolos> Yes, true
[20:26:16] <__adrian> with array_values(), though, it would.
[20:26:31] <TinoDidriksen> start:stop:step makes sense because start:stop already existed (and you say :7 is actually :start? Surely not). In a vacuum, I'd probably design that differently.
