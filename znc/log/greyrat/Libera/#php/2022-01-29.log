Besides, UTF-8 can technically have codepoints that need 5 or 6 byte representations, but we've all just agreed that 4 is plenty.

[03:53:44] <TinoDidriksen> UTF-8's 5-6 bytes has been impossible by decree since 2003. It's not an issue. We are nowhere near even thinking about extending the max code point. As for "a language better-served by UTF16/32/UCS anyway" then PHP does it correctly, imo. Keep strings as byte arrays, use functions for Unicode access. Perl/Python having Unicode-aware strings really messes up a lot of code.
[03:55:29] <TinoDidriksen> Even JS is fine, since strings there are always UTF-16. It's the dynamic string type that ruins things.

[04:14:46] <Sammitch> TML: that if you language lives in the part of Unicode that requires 3-4 byte UTF-8 sequences it's usually more compact to represent them as UTF-16 where they're mostly 2-byte sequences, or just go full-fat 4 byte UTF32/UCS always.

[15:31:41] <Naktibalda> I'm pretty sure that documentation format has changed around that time
[15:31:58] <delboy1978uk> in particular the 5.3 > 5.4 guide, which had a lot of changes, there are still many sites usuing old crap php, in fact that was the reason i was trying to find that page, to help someone

[15:55:53] <braindead_> what I want to achive now is that instead an output of "icon 3" it should show the icon n-times for the value that is. for example if the value is 3 it should print "icon icon icon"
[15:56:09] <braindead_> I know I need a for loop there but I cant manage to incorporate it
[15:56:30] <lembron> whats missing? ;-)
[15:56:58] <braindead_> I don't know php very well. I can read some stuff sometimes but I cant write it myself lembron
[15:57:39] <lembron> k, then the ".=" already appends, so you can just duplicate that code i guess
[15:58:03] <Naktibalda> braindead_: how about !+array_fill
[15:58:04] <php-bot> braindead_: how about, array array_fill(int start_key, int num, mixed val)  - Create an array containing num elements starting with index start_key each initialized to val - http://php.net/array_fill
[15:58:04] <lembron> either copypaste it 3 times :D - or loop it wth some "for ($index = 1; $index <= 3; $index++) { ..."

[15:59:16] <Naktibalda> you could raise pull request with links to that zend site too
[16:04:55] <braindead_> lembron and Naktibalda I am thinking about both of your suggestions but I cant really follow.
[16:05:42] <delboy1978uk> Naktibalda: would it not be better to just restore those pages from a previous commit?
[16:06:23] <da_wunder> most likely they won't do that - so the links to that zend site would be "proper" way to fix this
[16:06:40] <braindead_> lembron, if I duplicate that it just returns the value (which is dynamic btw) n-times. Instead of icon icon icon I get icon 3 icon 3 icon 3

[16:08:33] <lembron> braindead_ your actual "problem" is described just very vague, maybe expand on this, even in pseudo-code is fine so we understand what you actually wanne do
[16:09:13] <da_wunder> braindead_: eg. create example to 3v4l.org site
[16:14:21] <da_wunder> braindead_: I think that you want something like this - https://3v4l.org/jeKO3
[16:15:21] <braindead_> I hope this helps: https://pastebin.com/eWjGH5Sv This is the complete code, I will explain in a second.
[16:15:30] <da_wunder> braindead_: and same with array_fill - https://3v4l.org/nJL2r
[16:15:34] <braindead_> yes, da_wunder this looks like what i want to achieve
[16:17:40] <braindead_> this is the result of the code i posted
[16:17:42] <braindead_> https://i.imgur.com/WQj1xb7.png
[16:18:22] <braindead_> You can see that the first "4" shows one icon and the number 4. What I want to achieve now, is that instead of the number 4, the icon is printed 4 times (depending on the value)
[16:18:37] *** Quits: ThePhilgrim (~ThePhilgr@151.41.185.44) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:19:16] <braindead_> in that example for the value "difficulty"
[16:19:20] <lembron> braindead_ where from is get_custom_field() function?
[16:19:57] <da_wunder> so then you need to get that `4` value somewhere and eg. add custom method like I show on those 3v4l.org examples and use it to create those icons
[16:20:27] <braindead_> this is wordpress and this is the function for ACF (advanced custom fields). That is the custom field I define the valueÂ  in the wordpress post
[16:21:18] <braindead_> da_wunder I am looking at your example at the moment and try to combine it with what I have.
[16:21:26] <lembron> cause youll have todo that in get_custom_field() given this is what spits out that entire html.... - seems bit like a lost game, id try to address that from another front :/
[16:22:28] <lembron> modding around inside the plugin is a bit meh and will break a week later
[16:22:29] <braindead_> get_custom_field is only giving me the value "4" in that example. Cant I just for loop through that? print icon as long as i is smaller that value of field?
[16:23:07] <braindead_> This is not the plugin itself. This is a custom post type and filter. If I can get it work, it will not break through updates or anything
[16:24:45] <braindead_> for($i = 1; $i <= custom_field_value; $i++)Â  -- of course this is not working because I dont know how i can get that number in there
[16:25:08] <lembron> braindead_ you mean you can query it for just the number? - by the looks there id say that prints a whole buncha divÂ´s/spans and "also the icon"
[16:25:37] <lembron> like, see in your browser for the worm that follows the actual <div class="tour-details"> - should be a lot :P
[16:25:50] <braindead_> Yes, that is what I did to style it later on
[16:26:25] <Naktibalda> braindead_: don't call function in for() condition, it will be executed on each iteration. correct way to do it before loop and assign result to variable
[16:27:19] <lembron> braindead_ so get_custom_field  is code from you, what then internally calls ACFÂ´s get_field() - and in there you have a plain "4"?
[16:29:15] <braindead_> yes, plain 4
[16:29:34] <braindead_> its not actually a code from me but a function that is already provided
[16:31:23] <braindead_> the 'key' i provided there is the name of the custom field. Thats why see a couple different keys there, one for each custom field that contains either text or an int like in that case
[16:31:59] <lembron> maybe post html to your screenshot from the page, that should clear this up as/if its spitting a whole lot more - and then the journey goes inside the custom_field func pretty much
[16:37:58] <da_wunder> yep, seems like that custom_field function is doing a lot of more than just returning 4, basically it seems to return that actual icon and that 4 value - we cannot be sure because we don't know what that method is actually doing

[16:58:41] <braindead_> i understand :(
[16:59:09] <da_wunder> but literally from your code share and that screenshot, that method is _literally_ returning a html string which contains that icon and the value of that key - and not just value 4
[17:00:56] <braindead_> yes, its returning the icon and the number 4
[17:01:12] <braindead_> but if I remove the icon from the array its just returning 4
[17:01:53] <da_wunder> are you absolutely sure that is returning integer in that case?

[17:03:19] <braindead_> da_wunder, yes, inside a div but thats because I added that before too
[17:03:21] <da_wunder> if yes - then you could just do something like `$output .= $this->yourCustomMethod($this->get_custom_field(['key' => 'difficulty']));` and then just add that `yourCustomMethod to that class where you create those icons

[17:08:22] <braindead_> da_wunder, how would I add this? Sorry I dont want you to do my work but I just don't know how I could proceed from your code there
[17:09:58] <da_wunder> by adding that custom method to that class, should not be so hard - https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php
[17:10:20] <braindead_> as far as I am aware I need to do following: 1) define a variable x with the value of get_field 2) make a for loop that prints an icon as long as <= x 3) print icons
[17:11:41] <da_wunder> but still be sure that `get_custom_field` method is really returning an integer when you only call it with that `['key' => 'something']` parameter - most likely it doesn't return integer - but we cannot be sure because you've not shared that with us
[17:16:08] <da_wunder> braindead_: simple example - https://3v4l.org/GEbIN
[17:23:02] <braindead_> thank you da_wunder, I am looking at your example right now. Just wanted to share this: https://pastebin.com/3hVMWHMQÂ  With that I get n icons based on the number in the field. But it only shows this now and nothing of my other stuffÂ :)
[17:24:38] <da_wunder> your example is not showing us the whole case - just a part of it - so we cannot really know what you're actually doing there...

[17:40:02] <braindead_> Of course it needs to be a wrong syntax but where is it?

[17:41:18] <da_wunder> change that `return $html;` to `$output .= $html;`

[17:45:32] <lembron> refactor to some get_icon_repeated($iconname, $repetitions) or such (park it next to the get_custom_field code i guess) and then you can have a clean "$output .= $this->get_icon_repeated("ticon ticon-clock-o", get_field('schwierigkeitsgrad')); or so

[17:47:04] <biberu> schwierigkeitsgrad is a pretty difficult word
[17:47:35] <lembron> i see what you did there....
[17:47:44] <da_wunder> and for that I recommend you to use english and not your native language
[17:49:27] <Blondie101010> that's very debatale, though I agree
[17:49:45] <Blondie101010> *debatable
[17:50:12] <braindead_> yes, thats why I showed you the english version first. normally I use english terms too but I named the fields in german because of frontend use. Will change that later maybe
[17:51:09] <braindead_> frontend in that case = backend of wordpress where the user uses that fields. anyway, makes sense to rename the actual field name of course
[17:52:12] <biberu> fwiw, if it's a domain term i'd use the same one as the business
[17:52:18] <braindead_> that refactor code I dont understand
[17:53:34] <lembron> braindead_ just to move that block (your code between test) out of this "template" file into some function/class file or wherever the get_custom_field is already defined
[17:54:00] <Blondie101010> sticking to business terms in code can make code quite ugly
[17:57:07] <biberu> depends, if it's complex domain it's nice that everyone can use the same words when talking about it
[17:57:15] <braindead_> lembron, maybe I misunderstand but get_custom_field is already used in that template file. If I copy it to functions.php (wordpress related) what would I gain? Just better readability or any other advantages?
[17:57:35] *** Joins: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)
[17:58:08] <lembron> braindead_ were talking about "using this func" vs. "where its defined"
[17:58:13] <braindead_> and how would I use it in that file then? It might be super obvious to you guys but I am just happy it finally works now
[18:02:44] <lembron> somewhere you already have code alla "function get_custom_field() { .... }"  -- this will be inside some class (as you seem to use $this to call it) you can now add your own function "after that" with some "function get_incon_repeated($class, $repetitions) { for ... }" where the code in that is then line 48 to 58 aprox
[18:05:07] <lembron> then swap out the fixed html-classnames to the param (maybe you want thumbs instead of clocks somewhere else), and youd want to keep the get_field('schwierigkeitsgrad') part inside that template too, so both are arguments to your function "get_incon_repeated"
[18:05:11] <lembron> @ braindead_
[18:09:12] <braindead_> thank you lembron. I know I should follow this advise but for now my batteries are burned. I can change the icons easily in that file and I know I have it all in one place. I am sure it would take you 2 minutes to clean this up but for now I leave it like that. Still, thank you for your explanation about how to improve it
[18:10:27] <lembron> braindead_ sure sure ;-) - just remember what was said when in 2 weeks you go in there to copypasta that code to not only get icons for difficulty, but now also based on the length or so :P
[18:12:50] <braindead_> It is already like that. I am currently adjusting the icons. Thats an issue I dont really see atm. I do understand that might not be best practice and I surely understand it would be better to have functions at one place. Maybe I reconsider it later but I wouldnt be able to do it right now without breaking everything again and asking more questions
