[00:00:29] <judah> Trying to troubleshoot a WordPress plugin built for $3.99 by an overseas bidder just isnt doing it for me

[00:03:10] <Sammitch> judah: the trouble with trying to get into high-level networking is that you first need experience with high-level networking...
[00:04:15] <judah> Thats exactly the problem. I am patiently waiting for the IT head at my local school district to retire. The problem is that they expect his replacement to have the same amount of experience as he has, as he is leaving for retirement. Very difficult industry to crack into, even if you are operating at a high level in the same field
[00:04:42] <Sammitch> and the number of people needed to work on it is some ridiculously powerful logarithm of the size of the company. usually zero, occasionally one, only more if you work for an ISP
[00:05:22] <judah> I have been applying to work with a bunch of local ISPs. They have a good amount of turnover for lower level techs, but the youngest actual engineer I have seen was about 45 years old
[00:05:29] <Sammitch> judah: for positions like that you are pretty much required to look elsewhere for a new job that is a promotion
[00:05:57] *** Joins: darkstarx (~darkstard@50.39.115.145)

[00:07:10] <judah> Oh its not a problem with age, that wasnt the point. Its that you cant get your 20 years of experience under your belt if you dont already have 20 years experience under your belt

[00:07:42] <Sammitch> da_wunder: nothing. but most companies do not need more than one.
[00:08:00] <judah> I am trying to side-step the career ladder by doing it myself. Not going great. Turns out that you can be capable of building this kind of thing, or you can be capable of selling it, but not both. https://forum.level1techs.com/t/im-building-a-datacenter/173097
[00:08:36] <da_wunder> Sammitch: sure, eg. we have multiple people on each job with proper level of knowledge - age is not the issue at all
[00:09:20] <Sammitch> the trouble with trying to train a greenhorn on BGP configuration is that a misconfiguration can break the internet
[00:09:31] <Sammitch> not like, the internet at your office. The Internet.

[00:12:56] <Sammitch> I got a _little_ bit of training because I proved to my mentor that I was not a careless person, but ultimately I was in the same position of judah where it was either leave the company or wait for my mentor to die

[00:21:53] <relipse> so judah  are you a network administrator hosting websites and stuff?
[00:23:01] <judah> Yeah. Started off as a hobby, hosting websites out of the server cabinet in my bedroom in high school. Kinda grew from there. I got stuck in the programming field because I happen to also be good at programming, but its not really what I _want_ to do
[00:23:38] <judah> It brings in about $300/mo. Not much, but pays for itself and leaves some spending money left over
[00:24:58] <judah> My "big spending clients" are all hosting MineCraft servers, strangely enough. I do host a bunch of random blogs and sites for local businesses though. There are a few PBX systems kicking about too

[00:46:17] <judah> I saw that. Spent some time upgrading all the servers to the latest version this morning. Luckily the workaround is just an easy command line argument, but the patch was pretty quick as well

[17:03:29] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: version control is great
[17:03:45] <ThePhilgrim> It sure is! That's how I solved it :D
[17:04:14] <biberu> ThePhilgrim: if you committed that one by mistake, it's good to commit units of work that belong together, and review what you're staging ^^
[17:04:33] <biberu> if you're using git, git diff is your friend :)
[17:05:29] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, it's always the last commit at night when you feel like "whatever, it's fine. Wanna go to bed"
[17:05:43] <ThePhilgrim> Comes back to bite ya
[17:07:03] <biberu> you can redo commits later too, if you e.g. commit drafts or unfinished work

[17:08:00] <ThePhilgrim> As in unstage a commit after already pushing?
[17:09:58] <biberu> after pushing is trickier if you're working with others, but otherwise yes

[19:46:25] <green-> Is this an appropriate place for Twig questions? Trying to figure out why tests for defined seem to return true no matter what, and tests for empty always return false
[19:48:04] <__adrian> a twig-focused channel/forum/etc. would be better, but someone here may know. twig uses s/o:   https://twig.symfony.com/development
[19:48:41] <__adrian> they also have pretty thorough docs
[19:50:53] <green-> __adrian: the docs seem to provide a method that doesn't return expected results, and there's some mention of a known issue with defined tests, but none of the posted solutions seem to work etiher :) I'll see if there's a twig channel. Thanks.
[19:51:33] <green-> unfortunately no twig channel
[19:56:39] <Naktibalda> #symfony is more appropriate
[20:00:18] <green-> Naktibalda: gracias
