[01:05:59] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Would Outlook online capture something like that? M365 seemed to have some default rules to capture suspicious things like huge deletions of mail and so on

[01:06:03] <Bru^> worth a shot i guess
[01:06:10] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I mean, if someone had Domain Admin they could probably disable it, too.
[01:07:31] <mistiry> yes you can alert on and/or prevent external mail fowarding rules created in a mailbox. this was a tranport rule, i am unsure if you can alert on that or not, though i'd think it is something you could set up.
[01:07:52] <DrGibbysWifi> def alert, I've set them up
[01:08:04] <DrGibbysWifi> iirc m365 has that enabled by default to the security admin role 
[01:08:28] <mistiry> makes sense. i did it for users setting up rules in their mailbox. i didnt control the o365 transport rules though, idk what security team had set up
[01:09:02] <mistiry> and even if they didnt have a built-in way to alert you, plenty of other ways you could monitor that yourself
[01:09:28] <DrGibbysWifi> absolutely 
[01:09:59] <mistiry> these guys added a user to TenantAdmins, too. another thing that should _IMMEDIATELY_ alert you
[01:10:03] <DrGibbysWifi> a pretty common TTP for exfil/foothold is doing shit like that
[01:10:29] <mistiry> yeah for sure
[01:10:39] <mistiry> thats why i would expect you could alert on it natively
[01:10:45] <mistiry> or even it be a default

[02:17:26] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> how does SPF work?
[02:17:37] <signofzeta> @sysadmin by using DNS records
[02:18:15] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> if my domain is example.us and the MX records are mail.example.us, both with an IP of 192.169.10.100, do I need both the A and the MX in the SPF TXT record?
[02:18:35] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> mail server and web server share an IP
[02:18:52] <signofzeta> No, either the IP address (ip4:/ip6:) or the MX token ("mx").  However, IPs are preferred.
[02:19:21] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> signofzeta: So it's IP or MX and not both that is needed?
[02:19:24] <signofzeta> For example, "v=spf1 ip4:web.server.ip.addr ip6:web:server:ip:address -all"
[02:19:45] <signofzeta> Correct, the IP is sufficient here.
[02:19:46] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> There is no IPv6 here
[02:19:53] <signofzeta> Then just the IPv4 token will do.
[02:19:55] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Ok, so no MX
[02:19:57] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> token
[02:20:25] <signofzeta> It's considered best practice to use ip4/ip6 whenever possible, to minimize the number of DNS lookups needed to evaluate your record.  Once you hit ten, you PermError.

[02:31:00] <signofzeta> Suppose your domain is example.com.  "a" by itself looks up A records for example.com.  But you can use "a:someotherdomain.com" to use *those* A records instead.  This is pretty rare.  I think I've only seen WP Engine and other shitty vendors use those.

[05:06:12] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> kind of the point is that doctors can technically say the right things but their body language and tone affect patient compliance
[05:06:54] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> so what if their "message" was miscommunicated as condescending or something. it sounds more intentional
[05:07:58] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> I'm bored so I think i'm going to leave it. I never heard "purple prose" before
[05:09:29] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> I was thinking that like, in a advertisement, body language and tone are like the selling parts, flashy, exciting, suppose to make you feel like buying the product, while the words spoken are the fine print, because it's technical
[05:09:59] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> and apparently the least important part of communication even though that where all the content is
[05:11:20] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> which the professor showed the whole 57/37/7% thing and annoyed the hell out of me. 57% is body language, 37% is tone, 7% is the words spoken. It sounds too simple, like "we only use 10% of our brain" but then i looked up research and it's important to medical doctors because they have a bad habit of not giving a shit about tone and body language or something
[05:11:58] <sd> 05<B​ottlenekDolfin> So i'm stuck arguing that something is too simple and sounds stupid and at the same time it's kind of important to get through to some people

[12:53:54] <lancehead> I fly with skill, not with... fdl 
[12:54:45] <monr0e> you wanna see beams? Go look up Rui's beam-de-lance. Now transplant those four beams to the seven on a gunship. That's my beamship
[12:54:55] <lancehead> Hey quick question... you wouldn't happen to know cisco ios commands off the top of your head right?
[12:55:09] <lancehead> I cannot figure out static routes
[12:55:31] <monr0e> Nope, but there's the command reference if you need it: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fundamentals/command/reference/cf_book.html
[12:55:39] <lancehead> I'm reading through CCNA2 as we speak 
[12:55:44] <lancehead> Just don't get it :P 
[12:56:22] <monr0e> What part don't you get?
[12:57:17] <lancehead> next hop address, what's it supposed to be? 
[12:57:25] <lancehead> I know you start with dest addr/netmask 
[12:57:31] <lancehead> But wtf is a next hop 
[12:58:10] <kerat58> the address of the router who gets you to the next step in the trace
[12:58:17] <monr0e> The next router in the chain. take a look at this: https://i0.wp.com/www.technig.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/CCNA-Lab-Configure-Static-Routing.jpg
[12:58:26] <lancehead> Okay so 
[12:58:54] <lancehead> I have R1 - 209.165.201.0/24, ISP - 209.165.201.2/24 (not actual IPs dont worry) 
[12:59:10] <lancehead> I would do "ip route 209.165.201.0 255.255.255.0 209.165.201.2" correct? 
[12:59:40] <lancehead> Uh wait no the other way around, .2 to .0
[12:59:45] <lancehead> Assuming ISP is my dest
[12:59:58] <monr0e> I think you're going backwards
[13:00:36] <monr0e> Wait scratch that. How many routers do you have on network?
[13:00:40] <lancehead> 2
[13:01:08] <lancehead> Well, 4 total, but I'm trying to static route 2 of them that're directly connected 
[13:02:22] <lancehead> I can send you a screenie of the topology if that helps? 
[13:02:34] <lancehead> It's just a PT assignment
[13:03:20] <monr0e> ok, so I would start looking at internal addresses first - i.e. in the 192.168 area. That image I linked is a relatively ok setup, so I'd copy it. Use the principle demonstrated, too - rather than xxx.xxx.xxx.<change> use xxx.xxx.<change>.x to denote principle order
[13:04:02] <monr0e> I don't think there's a use case for creating a static route to the ISP - but I could be wrong
[13:04:07] <monr0e> also, #networking
[13:04:09] <lancehead> Ah I didn't realize that was an image
[13:04:27] <lancehead> Also, it's just "because you can" in this case to demonstrate that I'm able to 
[13:04:30] <monr0e> Look at the image first, then look at the structure: https://www.technig.com/configure-static-routing-cisco-router/
[13:04:35] <lancehead> Also also, technig.com is a horrible name for a site 
[13:04:44] <monr0e> Hah, I just realised that

[13:12:31] <monr0e> does it work when you add another router to the mix?
[13:12:32] <lancehead> So I'm re-reading/learning everything as I go
[13:12:51] <lancehead> nah monr0e I just got the routing wrong. I'll send you a pic hang on

[13:13:13] <lancehead> Was routing from R1 to Server-PT
[13:13:30] <lancehead> So the solution was ip route 10.0.10.0 /24 209.165.201.2
[13:13:43] <lancehead> I was using the wrong destination subnet
[13:13:45] <monr0e> Oh, ISP in the middle of a hop to server

[13:14:21] <lancehead> we have to use PT :( 
[13:14:43] <csws> why don't you use a /30 for the connection between the routers?
[13:14:53] <Activ8> I didn't do the exam lancehead I did traning at the time in server 2003, exchange 2010 and ccna
[13:14:59] <monr0e> FYI in the field it might be a better solution to add a VPN for a single server - although for a cluster idk. I'm not familiar with how modern cloud networks are implemented in enterprise.
[13:15:09] <lancehead> I didn't come up with the topology, I just have to do stuff in it csws
[13:15:10] <Activ8> we were doing a very large migration

[17:39:02] <Molnija> you kinda came back to it and are innocentoid
[17:39:25] <Kiernian> he's not warning anyone, lol, or at least it didn't sound like it to me.
[17:39:39] <Kiernian> warning implies impending negative consequences
[17:39:46] <Molnija> yeeeaaaa
[17:39:53] <Arlion> there is always negative consequences
[17:40:09] <Hunterkll> he's telling you all to stop being fucking morons/degenerates/cringey as fuck/what the hell is all this anyway/etc

[17:44:16] <Hunterkll> IRC standard nomenclature is PM

[17:44:26] <NTSYSTEM> instagram thang
[17:44:38] <NTSYSTEM> both came out over ten years ago
[17:44:42] <Hunterkll> i'm actually pretty sure twitter made the terminology around the mid 2000s
[17:44:43] <JollyRgrs> you slide into DMs... you send a PM to an IRC user :P
[17:44:48] <NTSYSTEM> whatcha doing, still sending lotus notes
[17:44:48] <Hunterkll> and others adopted it
[17:44:49] <Molnija> Hunterkll: it may be retroactively applied to all snoopable DMs
[17:45:07] <Hunterkll> IRC doesn't have DMs, that is just absolutely incorrect terminology

[17:45:13] <PattyCakes> probably the best lyric in a song ever "Grandma on speed dial i call it instagram"
[17:45:14] <Hunterkll> which you should be ashamed of for using in a technology oriented channel
[17:45:15] <Hunterkll> :)
[17:45:21] <Molnija> DM = direct message
[17:45:23] <NTSYSTEM> it's called direct message on proper irc clients :)
[17:45:40] <Molnija> PRIVMSG or NOTICE user :direct message
[17:45:42] <Hunterkll> Molnija: I know what it means, it just isn't a proper term for IRC 
[17:45:54] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll tell us some war stories
[17:45:58] <Hunterkll> RFC 1459 section 4.4.1
[17:46:11] <Molnija> if it isn't crypted, it's a DM. also the RFC calls me mommy
[17:46:12] <Hunterkll> the command is literally PRIVMSG not DIREMSG
[17:46:21] <AnonymooseReddtr> erm its /msg
[17:46:23] <Hunterkll> DMs can be encrypted too .....
[17:46:32] <JollyRgrs> well, unless the private message is a dire one... then what?
[17:46:34] <sintax> or /query
[17:46:35] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: at the raw protocol layer, /msg is translated by clients into PRIVMSG
[17:46:36] <NTSYSTEM> you can send photos as DM which can be encrypted yes 
[17:46:46] <Kiernian> You know it's a real sysadmin discussion when RFC's are getting busted out.
[17:46:54] <Hunterkll> erm, according to you, any sort of IM-style conversation function is a "DM"
[17:46:56] * sintax googles RFC
[17:47:00] <Hunterkll> so IMs over ICQ are now DMs
[17:47:03] <Hunterkll> apparently
[17:47:04] <NTSYSTEM> no, there is also instant messaging
[17:47:06] <Hunterkll> and those can be encrytped too
[17:47:08] <PattyCakes> Hunterkll god damn it, it's 8:15AM
[17:47:09] <PattyCakes> it's too damn early to be quoting RFC
[17:47:13] <Hunterkll> any "DM" can be encrypted
[17:47:13] <Molnija> PRIVMSG is a name for, ironically, what it never was - private messaging
[17:47:20] <NTSYSTEM> IM, DM, PM and NOTICE 
[17:47:22] <Hunterkll> that's precisely what it is 
[17:47:25] <Kiernian> IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY

[17:47:40] <Hunterkll>    PRIVMSG is used to send private messages between users.  <receiver>
[17:47:40] <Hunterkll>    is the nickname of the receiver of the message.  <receiver> can also
[17:47:40] <Hunterkll>    be a list of names or channels separated with commas.

[17:47:54] <PattyCakes> get back to work
[17:47:57] <PattyCakes> where's cryptic1 when we need him
[17:47:58] <Hunterkll> NTSYSTEM: Well, no shit, there I was in Iraq.....
[17:47:59] <Molnija> it isn't private - the libera ircops could intercept them if necessary
[17:48:10] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll did you use DM or PM's in Iraq?
[17:48:12] <Hunterkll> Molnija: it's private in the context of not being sent to a wider channel, and that's the entire point.
[17:48:16] <Hunterkll> NTSYSTEM: i used a fucking radio
[17:48:18] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:48:18] <Molnija> add OTR and suddenly it's PM
[17:48:23] <Hunterkll> .....
[17:48:24] <Hunterkll> no
[17:48:25] <NTSYSTEM> so is radio TCP or DUP
[17:48:26] <NTSYSTEM> UDP
[17:48:33] <Hunterkll> NTSYSTEM: idk ask harris they made 'em
[17:48:39] <sintax> heh
[17:48:40] <Molnija> NTSYSTEM: no, it may carry both however

[17:48:46] <Hunterkll> jesus christ

[17:49:02] <A_Dragon> `151759    Molnija ╡ it isn't private - the libera ircops could intercept them if necessary` so could anyone along your path without tls
[17:49:04] <sintax> re-inventing the wheel
[17:49:05] <NTSYSTEM> but if you make a radio broadcast and no one hears it, does it make a sound?
[17:49:08] <Hunterkll> DM and PM are effectively interchangable when it comes to shit like twitter, instagram, IRC, etc
[17:49:10] <A_Dragon> you gotta trust someone :P or use OTR
[17:49:13] <Hunterkll> but in terms of context, IRC uses PMs 
[17:49:21] <NTSYSTEM> isn't OTR really "on the record"
[17:49:23] <Hunterkll> other platforms which aren't as chat oriented use DM 
[17:49:28] <A_Dragon> Off The Record
[17:49:30] <Hunterkll> that's it, end of story
[17:49:31] <A_Dragon> is what OTR stands for
[17:49:38] <Hunterkll> this is almost as bad as the API == Protocol discussion from the other day

[17:50:25] <PattyCakes> FITE ME
[17:50:26] <A_Dragon> NTSYSTEM: APIs are the things you ask computers to do, protocols are how you ask them to do it
[17:50:27] <Hunterkll> Molnija: in IRC, a PM = a direct message between two people not involving a channel
[17:50:28] <Hunterkll> that's it
[17:50:30] <Hunterkll> end of story 
[17:50:33] <Hunterkll> that's how it's been for 40 years 
[17:50:34] <Emet-Selch> SirSlapsalot: I am getting popcorn as well
[17:50:39] <A_Dragon> Hunterkll: actually, if you want to be specific, its both
[17:50:43] <NTSYSTEM> A_Dragon  then why can I have HTTP GET commands over API?
[17:50:45] <A_Dragon> as the protocol uses the same command for both
[17:50:50] <Hunterkll> ......
[17:50:52] <Hunterkll> the fuck
[17:50:55] <Hunterkll> no
[17:50:59] <NTSYSTEM> checkmate, atheists
[17:51:01] <A_Dragon> NTSYSTEM: you use the GET command, a part of the HTTP protocol, to access an API.

[17:51:08] <Hunterkll> cout << "some text";
[17:51:09] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> API is a patent pending technology from Oracle®
[17:51:10] * SirSlapsalot hands Emet-Selch a beer too
[17:51:12] <Hunterkll> that's not a fucking protocol
[17:51:15] <Hunterkll> and no protocol is used in there
[17:51:18] <Hunterkll> but damn sure an API is
[17:51:20] <NTSYSTEM> got cout << that's reminded me of C++ class
[17:51:22] <PattyCakes> HEY HEY SIRSLAPSALOT
[17:51:28] <A_Dragon> Hunterkll: `PRIVMSG user`, and `PRIVMSG #channel` are the same thing, IRC side.
[17:51:32] <PattyCakes> If you brought smoe for Emet-Selch, you have to bring enough for the class SirSlapsalot 
[17:51:38] * SirSlapsalot opens the fridge
[17:51:39] <NTSYSTEM> A_Dragon can you explain to me solderaity through python and api in 3 steps?
[17:51:50] <A_Dragon> NTSYSTEM: er, no
[17:51:59] <Hunterkll> A_Dragon: sure, but the differentiation is in the fact that a PM is without a channel between two users, and a channel send goes to all users in the channel
[17:52:00] <Hunterkll> simple enough
[17:52:03] <Hunterkll> that doesn't change anything I said
[17:52:06] <A_Dragon> Hunterkll: correct
[17:52:16] <Hunterkll> the protocol implementation doesn't change the truth of anything i've said or even it's technical correctness
[17:52:18] <Molnija> ‹2-user IM›, ‹DM›, and ‹2-user PM› are synonymous
[17:52:35] <A_Dragon> NTSYSTEM: an API describes the interface to a thing. A protocol describes how you send a message or do a job
[17:52:44] <Hunterkll> except you shouldn't mix nomenclature between technology stacks
[17:52:45] <A_Dragon> generally a protocol speaks to an API
[17:52:45] <JollyRgrs> did we just move from DM/PM convo to API/Protocol?
[17:52:48] <Hunterkll> therin lies the way to derision and confusion 
[17:52:53] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll no but if you don't use the proper word in accepted vernacular of the day, no one knows whatcha talking about. it's twice as important then the actual protocol itself. 
[17:52:53] <A_Dragon> JollyRgrs: its all an API argument
[17:53:04] <Molnija> PRIVMSG is just message to target, bots may respond, and NOTICE is message to target, bots may not respond
[17:53:08] <SirSlapsalot> grab a beer and some popcorn JollyRgrs 
[17:53:16] <A_Dragon> Molnija: if only bots actually listened to that
[17:53:16] <Hunterkll> NTSYSTEM: right, and almost all IRC users who aren't discord morons know the proper nomenclature, and a lot of other larger FOSS project channels will get confused if you use the term DM :)
[17:53:28] <Molnija> A_Dragon: by necessity, some don't
[17:53:36] <NTSYSTEM> Hunterkll that just means there's an age gap, people under 25 and over 25
[17:53:38] <A_Dragon> Molnija: most respond with PRIVMSGs anyway
[17:53:44] <NTSYSTEM> could also say 20 is the age too.
[17:53:45] <A_Dragon> and otherwise will respond to NOTICEs
[17:53:45] <Hunterkll> NTSYSTEM: not true at all 
[17:53:53] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Does the IETF have a definition of what a protocol is?
[17:54:03] <JollyRgrs> A_Dragon: some ppl in here have had issues in the past differentiating API from protocol :(
[17:54:15] * fritzwastaken pops a fresh bag of popcorn
[17:54:19] <NTSYSTEM> DM has also replaced PM as "forum" and FB vernacular.

[17:54:38] <Emet-Selch> JollyRgrs: we are doing parkour today

[17:54:39] <PattyCakes> and go work for UPS
[17:54:41] <A_Dragon> sorry, JollyRgrs *
[17:54:49] <NTSYSTEM> the kids use DM, but it's fun if you find the right discord channel saying "DM FOR LOGS"
[17:54:50] <Molnija> [PRIVMSG guff] target may be a user, channel, servermask, hostmask, or otherwise implementation-defined, or list of any or all of the above
[17:54:59] <JollyRgrs> A_Dragon: we have some dense people in here, esp with the discord bridge :(
[17:55:05] <Hunterkll> Molnija: okay?
[17:55:15] <NTSYSTEM> dense people are okay ;)
[17:55:20] <A_Dragon> not my fault people use discord bridges when IRC is trivial

[18:00:58] <PattyCakes> Dad got his starlink dish at that farm. I need to get around to getting down there and set it up for him
[18:01:01] <Hunterkll> you're deprioritized compared to other cellular tower customers (say, cellphones are priority 3, hotspots priority 4, t-mo home net is priority 6) 
[18:01:02] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> t mobile has the worst coverage of the 3 though...
[18:01:02] <NTSYSTEM> you can also stick the t-mob home internet sim card in a normal phone and enjoy that too, but no need nowadays w/ unlimited pans cheap 
[18:01:05] <sintax> star link just raised their prices
[18:01:07] <Kiernian> it's a year and change out of date, but nationwide infrastructure-wise, that's not so bad.
[18:01:14] <PattyCakes> yes sintax 
[18:01:25] <Hunterkll> @bdenlinger for the home internet coverage, it's got better than VZW by far, since VZW's kit is 5G only (so basically, just major cities and surruonding area)
[18:01:27] <sintax> blamed inflation
[18:01:30] <NTSYSTEM> $100/month for internet that's truly mobile isn't that bad especially considering how much you save in rent in the RV
[18:01:52] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Yea i was looking at a plan that was 300 GB for $115 I think
[18:01:53] <Hunterkll> starlink also only has one plan, and they've been cutting off people who aren't at their registered service address lately
[18:01:54] <NTSYSTEM> but I also yearn for the days I can sotp this internet thingand live a nice life in the country in dakota, with a shed and no technology

[18:01:57] <PattyCakes> NTSYSTEM isn't the roaming starkinky package $200/month?
[18:02:00] <PattyCakes> Hunterkll incorrect
[18:02:14] <NTSYSTEM> pattycakes was $100 or so AFAIK
[18:02:17] <Kiernian> if you're doing terabytes per month I imagine you're doing something with multiple SIM cards and bandwidth bonding

[18:16:06] <PublicWiFi> man you know what I need to do? get a battery terminal welder lol
[18:16:14] <PublicWiFi> you can get them pretty cheap
[18:16:25] <Hunterkll> i built one for like $50

[18:16:30] <teh_f4ll3n> to weld batteries to ground?
[18:16:34] <PublicWiFi> what'd you use for the leads? bigass pieces of copper?
[18:16:39] <PublicWiFi> or proper ends?

[18:18:50] <PublicWiFi> that aren't expesnive, prolly less than your build now tbh
[18:18:53] <teh_f4ll3n> that looks like something maccas would build
[18:19:01] <PublicWiFi> looks exactly like something I'd build
[18:19:12] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: yea, but my build has a lot more flexibility (and a floor pedal these days, stole one froma junked sewing machine)
[18:19:13] <Hunterkll> lol
[18:19:19] <PublicWiFi> i was about to say
[18:19:20] <Hunterkll> higher current capacity, etc 
[18:19:23] <PublicWiFi> a pedal would make it better

[20:18:41] <NTSYSTEM> So, anyone here worked for an insurance company in IT? I feel like they're the most sucky of what kind of org you could work for.
[20:19:30] <PattyCakes> NTSYSTEM USAA, not mainly insurance
[20:19:32] <PattyCakes> but yes
[20:19:39] <JollyRgrs> NTSYSTEM: why would you say that?
[20:19:42] <estranger> ive worked with a lot of insurance companies 
[20:19:57] <JollyRgrs> not all insurance companies are awful
[20:20:03] <estranger> NTSYSTEM, sucky as in culture, or tech stacks?
[20:20:04] <PattyCakes> their paychecks clear the same as others
[20:20:19] <PattyCakes> idgaf about much else. As long as the checks are good
[20:20:22] <PattyCakes> PattyCakes is happy
[20:20:28] <PublicWiFi> s/checks/dicks
[20:20:28] <layer8> PattyCakes meant: "idgaf about much else. As long as the dicks are good"
[20:20:43] <PattyCakes> I'll take a good dick but not as pay PublicWiFi 
[20:20:45] <NTSYSTEM> Culture, paychecks are the same but I was in a shop in a bit that treated sprint daily standups as attendence calls and you were penalized for not talking 10-15 minus, daily 30 min outlook booking always went to an hour
[20:20:48] <PublicWiFi> lol
[20:21:09] <estranger> NTSYSTEM, doyou have a specific insurance company in mind?
[20:21:09] <JollyRgrs> that's just $Company in general, not b/c they are insurance company or not
[20:21:16] <PattyCakes> NTSYSTEM daily standup is normal. yes you are expected to join.
[20:21:22] <NTSYSTEM> I think you're right @JollyRgrs 
[20:21:40] <estranger> whatever you do.. do not work for the green gecko one
[20:21:45] <JollyRgrs> and yeah... most companies have some form of "checkup" call... sometimes daily standup, sometimes weekly or semi-weekly, etc.
[20:21:49] <NTSYSTEM> everyone agreed with it too, I honestly didn't understand it, I said that's now not how standups worked and the sprint master took me aside and said that's how they do things there
[20:21:50] <PattyCakes> now if your standups are lasting longer than 30 minutes, that's $Company fault
[20:21:55] <estranger> in fact, if you use the green gecko CHANGE 
[20:22:12] <NTSYSTEM> then it was 5 hours of meetingd daily, with 30 mins spaced apart, so I asked "when do we do engineering here, lol"
[20:22:18] <vinrock> fuck geico
[20:22:27] <DrGibbysWifi> man, wrapping up loose ends today
[20:22:28] <estranger> they are the worst ive seen in every way
[20:22:29] <JollyRgrs> my current company, we don't do standups, but we do have "check-in" meetings on Tues/Thurs
[20:22:30] <DrGibbysWifi> feels good man
[20:22:33] <JollyRgrs> DrGibbysWifi: nice!

[22:38:31] <Hunterkll> less clients = less work = reduced hours/etc
[22:38:43] <bomb> that's why I asked his industry
[22:38:45] <Hunterkll> i saw a lot of layoffs early on because of that
[22:38:46] <Arlion> I used to work for a prominent cruise line company, I switched positions to a different company for a pay cut that was covid safe.
[22:38:57] <Hunterkll> and IT was hit hard in the beginning 
[22:39:02] <bomb> industry is defined by the clients, not your actual job description
[22:39:35] <Hunterkll> IT as a large sweeping thing was hit, especially with companies that couldn't/failed to adapt/failed entirely

[22:55:49] <Arlion> well aparently not well enough if they know its your wifes.
[22:55:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> so they are phishing her trying to get it 
[22:56:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> I suspect they pulled the SIM card and read it?
[22:56:10] <AnonymooseReddtr> were able to get the # off it?
[22:56:16] <Arlion> how old was this iphone?
[22:56:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> iphone 12
[22:56:29] <Arlion> i thought they were digital sims by now.
[22:56:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> was not using e-sim
[22:56:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> it had a physical sim card

[22:59:38] <misspwn> am wife, not all are clueless :D
[22:59:39] <Hunterkll> with cellular off

[22:59:46] <Arlion> oh just my wife is
[22:59:49] <misspwn> hah
[23:00:24] <Arlion> she is very smart. Engineer and everything. makes all of our own furniture 
[23:00:24] <misspwn> my husband put the toilet paper at the very top shelf in the laundry room. i can't reach it even with the stepstool he got me cause he got tired of seeing me climb dangerously
[23:00:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> right 
[23:00:39] <misspwn> we all have our moments for sure
[23:00:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> That's what I figured Hunterkll
[23:00:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> the sim was disabled, for sure but I figured they popped it into an unlocked phone
[23:00:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> got the # 
[23:00:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> and started phishing
[23:01:02] <Arlion> Just not with computers. which is a very high bar if I'm a cloud engineer and runs my own k3s cluster on our home network so
[23:01:11] <AnonymooseReddtr> its a paperweight

[23:02:52] <vinrock> sorry
[23:02:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> arlion there is
[23:02:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> the phone has been wiped / reset
[23:03:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> but apple devices have an activation lock
[23:03:28] <AnonymooseReddtr> so even though its wiped the back end apple systems won't let it activate because its been locked to her account
[23:03:43] <Activ8> if you have proof of purchase you just upload it to them and they will unlock it
[23:03:55] <Arlion> vinrock: no u
[23:03:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> Activ8 there is no proof of purchase - the phone is stolen
[23:04:04] <Activ8> ah then no proof no unlock

[23:20:32] <databender> I'm just trying to figure out how to manage it; it's definitely a mess because our sources of truth are bogs of pain and sadness.
[23:21:26] <databender> I guess setting it up myself will have to do; I was hoping that there was a good community to work with, but I can't find anything other than technet forums.  Which are also bogs of pain and sadness.
[23:21:40] <Hunterkll> that's always the case with those forums

[23:25:57] <csws> MIM
[23:26:00] <csws> god help you databender 
[23:26:22] <Hunterkll> MIM's only as bad as the people who set it up and the inputs / systems it has to interact with, no better or worse
[23:26:29] <Hunterkll> we use MIM extensively, but not for IdP stuff 
[23:26:47] <csws> the web UI on it is absolutely terrible
[23:26:53] <csws> you can't convince me there's some way that it isn't awful
[23:26:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> its pretty old
[23:26:56] <csws> laggy piece of shit
[23:27:00] <Hunterkll> cue "there's a web UI?" joke 
[23:27:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol Hunterkll
[23:27:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> i've got MIM setup in my lab but only the sync service
[23:27:26] <Hunterkll> set up JIT/JEA admin stuff
[23:27:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> there are some doc pages 
[23:27:31] <Hunterkll> pretty neat overall
[23:27:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> lemme see if i can find some helpful links for you
[23:27:45] <databender> Lol, we can't even access our HR database as Tyler Tech took over our stuff, so we have to restore the cloud database on prem, do MIM stuff with it, then export changes and cloud ingests .csv via SFTP 
[23:27:47] <csws> we had it plugged into SAP but we also had users that were just in MIM (like non SAP contractors)
[23:27:48] <Hunterkll> but overall MIM really expects you to be well versed in IdP type stuff 
[23:28:16] <Hunterkll> databender: .... wut
[23:28:18] <Hunterkll> that's
[23:28:21] <Hunterkll> disgusting

[23:30:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> i set it up in my lab this week to automate provisioning B2B users between two tenants
[23:30:38] <Hunterkll> though, then we go AD -> Azure SSO for any cloud/SAML/oauth based apps
[23:30:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> there is a MIM Graph API connector

[23:31:15] <databender> yeah, we're doing that too, but we have two sources of truth (staff and students) and it's been put into production being half baked.  
[23:31:43] <Hunterkll> that's not terrible
[23:31:53] <Hunterkll> i mean, having multiple sources
[23:32:03] <Hunterkll> i've seen deployments with 90+ sources and a ton of cross connections
[23:32:08] <databender> Lol, it is if I don't have access to them!
[23:32:24] <databender> It's probably not that bad, but I can't see what the original records are, so it's kind of confusing
[23:32:31] <databender> Also I suck at database stuff.
[23:32:44] <databender> Most of the pain is probably my skillset not being complete
[23:32:59] <Hunterkll> i mean, at least they added gMSA support to MIM a few years ago
[23:33:02] <Hunterkll> that was a pain 
[23:34:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> Hunterkll yeah 90+ connections I wouldn't be touching it
[23:34:32] <Hunterkll> 90+ sources
[23:34:39] <Hunterkll> like 8 of them were just AD red forests
