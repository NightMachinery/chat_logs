[19:56:03] <steggy[m]> <aleks> "I'm trying to get diary entries..." <- Is that enough parts? What does "4 2" represent in terms of frequency? Not a diary user but it's not clear how to pull a month from there, and a quick look at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Special-Diary-Entries.html didn't reveal how what that's supposed to be
[19:59:42] <aleks> steggy[m]: It represents the month and day. It's used for recurring holidays, and birthdays. Other diary sexps work just fine...it makes me think that it's probably something to do with the fact that it's a julian calendar.
[20:01:43] <aleks> My workaround is to just use elisp, and just stick everything in `holiday-other-holidays`. That displays just fine in org-mode, probably because it relies on whatever internals are in the diary to convert julian to a regular ISO calendar
[20:02:53] <aleks> Seems more like a bug to me, given all other diary sexps appear fine in an agenda. Except for julian. Will probably report it after a bit more testing
[20:04:02] <steggy[m]> Ah, okay - so, were I you, I'd probably edebug into `org-get-entries-from-diary`, which it looks like is what's trying to do the parsing. Might also be worth checking whether the variable `diary-time-regexp` would match here
[20:04:52] <steggy[m]> huh, I'd think org knows how to convert, but maybe it doesn't know it's Julian? How does that get signalled up?

[20:05:49] <aleks> Wouldn't the diary-julian-date in the sexp clue org in?

[20:08:32] <aleks> Didn't know you wrote that part :)
[20:08:50] <steggy[m]> Haha no, sorry, I just meant "that's on me for not reading"
[20:09:17] <steggy[m]> I definitely don't have a head for how dates to get the julian -> gregorian or whatever conversions
[20:09:19] <aleks> Ah shame, was hoping for a quick fix :D

[20:32:04] <steggy[m]> Heh sorry, no easy fix like that. If you really want to solve it yourself, I'd try to edebug that function or manually create the diary-fancy-buffer and see what it populates and go from there, but yeah, it sure does sound like a bug from where I'm standing. 
[20:32:28] <steggy[m]> And I'd feel pretty comfortable in your case to put together what you have and submit it as a bug
[20:33:04] <steggy[m]> apropos of nothing else - why use diary and not just have org entries? Just curious since I only use the latter

[20:46:23] <alex79> In #+BEGIN_SRC blocks I prefer it if the top-level defintions of my code start at line 0. But if I hit enter  emacs indents the code. I tried to set org-src-preserve-indentation to nil but that didn't help. Is there another variable that controls this behavior?
[20:46:59] <alex79> *set org-src-preserve-indentation to t

[20:50:48] <steggy[m]> alex79: You can run C-h k ENTER(usually RET in emacs parlance) to see what's bound there - it looks like if electric-indent-mode is on it might try to indent, otherwise you might want to look at the hook
[20:52:05] <alex79> Disabling electric-indent helped.
[21:05:02] <steggy[m]> For the future - you could either turn electric indent global mode off, or add a hook on org buffers to turn it off, or to electric-indent-functions a function that returns nil if you are in an org-mode buffer and you have a RET. There are also a bunch of other things you could do, but those are the three that come top of mind here that you might try for getting this working more permanently
