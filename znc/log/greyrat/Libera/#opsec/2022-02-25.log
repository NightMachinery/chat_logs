[10:54:47] <home> especially with whats going on
[10:55:17] <Joanna> Which thing in particular?
[10:55:28] <home> the invasion stuff
[10:55:35] <Joanna> Ah
[10:55:40] <home> I checked like earlier this month and opsec had like 50 members
[10:55:47] <home> or around so, seems like there are 20 more people
[10:55:48] <Joanna> Yea I wonder about that
[10:56:01] <Joanna> It depends upon time of day

[11:01:26] <home> thanks for the share
[11:01:40] <home> been looking at air flight radar stuff, google maps traffic jams and etc
[11:02:12] <home> https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs this has been pretty reliable for me
[11:02:16] <home> in terms of news:
[11:02:21] <home> https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs <----reddit live
[11:03:57] <Joanna> I guess Russia didn’t care about ethnic Russians being used for target practice so much as having missiles pointed at them
[11:04:42] <Joanna> It happened 8 years ago during maidan revolution
[11:05:00] <Joanna> Or started rather
[11:08:16] <home> how can we help
[11:08:31] <home> like is there a pastebin or guide
[11:08:44] <home> or should I just create my own target list
[11:10:30] <Joanna> Are you there?
[11:10:36] <home> no
[11:11:21] <Joanna> I really don’t know anyone from Russia or Ukraine so I have no idea what the truth is
[11:12:44] <Joanna> I guess the Russians decided to invade now after letting ethnic Russians be used for target practice for 8 years
[11:12:55] <Joanna> Who knows...
