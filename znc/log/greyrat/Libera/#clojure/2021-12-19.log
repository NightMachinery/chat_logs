[00:00:29] <Para> There's also fun tug-of-war related to some features, like the CLR core engineers have publicly said that reified generics are in fact kinda terrible since they block most custom languages.
[00:03:21] <ridcully> anyway, regardless whether the data is immutable, what ever "optimization" is done behind the scenes depends on the runtime/language.  afair keywords/symbols are actually hold on to and you get the same things back.  but this is memoization (e.g. something holds on to things for you)
[00:03:32] <ridcully> but this is not done to anything
[00:04:21] <ridcully> popular examples are the boxed numbers up to 127(?) in java.  where you can smash that cache and change "5" to something else
[00:04:39] <Para> Was it so that keywords in code are interned but ones generated during runtime aren't?
[00:05:07] <Para> Something magical is done to make them unique though.
[00:09:16] <Para> ...checked source, everything is interned, or at least goes through Keyword#intern method

[01:10:53] <wnh> I think that error message is accurate, you dont have a :handler for :get. Im pretty sure reitit (which Im assuming is what we're looking at here) is just storing you `list-of-iotas` fn as metadata on the route. You either need to set it as {:get {:handler list-of-iotas}} or use the shortcut like in your :post endpoint above.
[01:11:15] <wnh> *storing your
[01:14:06] <v3ga> wnh: hmm... ohhh! i see. my redundant {:iotas (list of iotas)} when I already have that in the function as well. wth. 
[01:16:17] <v3ga> wnh: ok thanks, now its a 406, that I can work with.  I'll have to come back because I tried to mimick code from 'web dev in clojure' and they didn't use a :handler. they wer able to just pass their 'message-list' function and I'm not seeing any real differences.  I'll make a gist later comparing the attempts

[01:20:10] <jeaye> I got it all working well now, though.
[01:21:31] <wnh> Yeah. Keep a keen eye on the reitit docs. It lets you put any data in there, which down the line will likely be helpful for custom middleware and what not, but the docs aren't super clear on which provided libraries are looking at which keys.
[01:22:39] <wnh> But you can say that your api endpoint has a :favourite-colour, so that's a plus!
