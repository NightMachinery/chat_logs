[04:34:15] <piousminion> LambdaComplex:  "n. b." ?
[04:34:16] <drive_desaster> you can build discord yourself, if you need it. just download the PKGBUILD ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/packages/discord/trunk/PKGBUILD ) and rum mkpkg (you might need to remove the later two sums)

[05:20:32] <noobaroo> because the only thing different between it and LXMusic, which disappeared instantly no relogin or anything, (and Ive relogged in several times to see if chromium disappears) is that Chromium is a more complex .desktop entry with 3 sections so maybe something different has to be done

[06:22:33] <Synthead> when you pick up skills in arch, almost all of it apply to linux in general
[06:22:37] <gumbo> thrice: i like arch. ive distro hopped 5 times in 1 month trying to find a home
[06:22:50] <Synthead> this is different than picking up specific stuff for debian, gentoo, etc
[06:23:02] <Synthead> the wiki is great
[06:23:09] <Synthead> I've used the wiki for arch for other distros
[06:23:12] <thrice> gumbo: then use arch?  Or, if you haven't like that experience, don't use it
[06:23:17] <thrice> I don't understand the question
[06:23:26] <Synthead> I've used arch full time since about 2006 :)

[06:38:06] <jbg> I've got a disk image with GPT, an ESP and a root partition, which I have run `bootctl install` on. It boots fine on UEFI systems. What changes do I need to make to this image to make it also boot on legacy BIOS systems?
[06:38:30] <sheep> if I remember correctly, systemd-boot (bootctl) only works on EFI
[06:38:36] <jbg> yeah, that's correct
[06:38:47] <jbg> could I keep using systemd-boot on EFI and add something else for legacy BIOS
[06:38:51] <sheep> you would need to add a BIOS capable loader
[06:39:23] <jbg> I tried to use grub, but it gets really confused by my image build process (the partition mappings are set up with kpartx) whereas systemd-boot does not
[06:39:57] <jbg> if i want something like syslinux alongside systemd-boot, how does that work with the partition table? do I need one of those 'compatibility partitions'?
[06:39:58] <sheep> isn't grub able to identify drives and partitions by UUID?
[06:40:08] <gumbo> Synthead: been on gentoo arch debian ubuntu manjaro all in 1 month teying to make one my main. incsnt
[06:40:10] <gumbo> i cant
[06:40:15] <gumbo> also freebsd
[06:40:26] <sheep> I don't think syslinux works well on GPT drives, but I don't think it uses the BIOS Boot partition
[06:40:49] <rcf> That is strictly a grub thing

[06:40:57] <jbg> yes, but literally nothing i tried worked, it never saw any of the kpartx-mapped partitions. if i used losetup -p then it did, but i can't use that due to the restrictions of the container the build happens in
[06:41:10] <jbg> i spent 2 days trying to get grub to find the partitions and then gave up and systemd-boot worked without any issue
[06:41:22] <Scimmia> Yeah, I would use syslinux. It works fine with GPT, I've done it on a flash drive
[06:41:35] <jbg> ok, i'll give syslinux a shot
[06:41:36] <sheep> were the issues happening with grub-install, or were they happening while booting?

[22:03:04] <spasmaster> Hi, I'm trying to setup a new system, but I think I've miosconfigure the video driver. When I run alacritty or kitty it turn black, can't type. xterm works fine and glxgears doesnt rotates gears. It's an  intel uhd 750 card. I've only installed xf86-video-intel. I've probably forgot to install or config something, but I can't figure it out. Could someone help me.
[22:03:25] <Tamwyn> Tom^: that would at least explain why it works for me on second start.
