[02:47:45] <mdogg> When I was growing up (in America), I was taught to write in cursive and *had* to write in cursive if I wanted to continue passing English.  Kids today aren't even taught cursive in most schools.  Personally, I think cursive should be taught so that children understand the technique and how to apply it, but I think that at some point it should be up to the child to determine whether they would like to write or print. 
[02:50:50] <mdogg> My cursive wasn't very good.  When I began to print everything in capital block letters my penmanship improved dramatically.  But I think it is a shame for kids not to be taught cursive.

[04:57:48] <LjL> just curious because i thought of this word after "dissonant" but wiktionary didn't really give me the "clashing" meaning. then i looked for "dissonante" in italian, and it did translate it to "clashing", so i wasn't sure whether it was a false friend in this meaning, or wiktionary just missed a meaning

[15:22:01] <Lebela> hi
[15:22:55] <Lebela> I have come here with the most ridiculous question of all times, but it's gotta be asked anyway :)
[15:23:23] <Lebela> Are my ears wrong, or are some native speakers really saying "chewsday" when the mean "tuesday" ?
[15:24:08] <Lebela> to clarify even more what I am hearing, it sounds like "juiceday"

[15:57:49] <Me-me> JimmyRustles: Either 'He said, "Thank you," while everyone applauded.' OR '"Thank you," he said, while everyone applauded.' OR 'While everyone applauded, he said, "Thank you."'
[15:58:05] <Lebela> Should I immidate "Juiceday" or stick to "Tyuusday"?
[15:58:39] <Lebela> *imitate
[15:58:43] <Me-me> "Chewsday" would be more widely accepted, but I personally stick with "Tyuusday".
[15:59:10] <Lebela> thank you
[15:59:15] <Me-me> Happy to help.
[15:59:19] <Lebela> Me-me, is it "stick to" or "stick with" ?
[15:59:26] <Lebela> I said "stick to" and you then said "stick with"
[15:59:33] <Me-me> Either is acceptable. There is very little semantic difference.
[16:00:41] <Lebela> what difference, if you don't mind my asking?
[16:02:35] <Me-me> Hmm, well, thinking on it, you could somehow construct the idea that sticking "to" something means you are being taken and carried by that thing, whereas sticking "with" something means that you're more or less equals in the relationship. But again, that is all very artificial and not at all the connotations of the two terms - they essentially mean the exact same thing to just about everyone in just about every circumstance.
[16:03:10] <Me-me> That's just something I've made up on the spot. It would be difficult to find any actual use of the terms that wasn't identical.

[22:20:15] <m00nl1ght> on this channel or IRC?
[22:20:24] <Carl_GE> IRC 
[22:20:39] <m00nl1ght> oh, it's fun
[22:20:57] <Carl_GE> great that's what I'm looking for
[22:21:47] <m00nl1ght> plenty of channels, although it can get lonely sometimes
[22:22:25] <Carl_GE> i was wondering seeing 235 ppl in the channel and no visible conversations
[22:23:02] <LjL> people often seem confused about that when they see it
[22:23:15] <Carl_GE> hi LjL
[22:23:30] <huf> idling is a time honored tradition
[22:23:33] <Carl_GE> i guess many conversations take place in private rooms
[22:23:48] <huf> our watchword!
[22:23:49] <LjL> but many/most people who have a fixed presence on IRC don't just join *when* they want to talk, we stay connected... so 235 people definitely doesn't mean we're all talking (which would be quite unwieldy, too)
[22:24:31] <LjL> many conversations take place in private messages more than private rooms, but a lot of it is just you seem to be expecting more conversation than there reasonably can be
[22:24:49] <LjL> it's not YouTube live video comments where you can't even keep track :P
[22:24:57] <m00nl1ght> yea that would definetly be a mess
[22:24:58] <huf> can be like that
[22:25:11] <Carl_GE> what's the difference between private rooms and private messages
[22:25:16] <huf> I once joined #xkcd, and that was a constant stream of horror
[22:25:17] <LjL> when it becomes like that, people stop liking it. there's a pace that's nice, not too silent, not too crazy
[22:25:43] <apsxow> Is this correct and natural English?   In 2005, the Swedish Association of Road Transport Companies filed a complaint against Lidl. The company was allegedly using foreign forwarding companies for national road freight transport within Sweden, which is in breach of EU rules.
[22:25:49] <huf> Carl_GE: private messages go to a specific nick
[22:26:01] <m00nl1ght> private messages are basically one-on-one conversations
[22:26:06] <Carl_GE> thx huf
[22:26:20] <huf> Carl_GE: private rooms are just... they're channels nobody knows about, or channels that have specific access rules set
[22:26:44] <m00nl1ght> that my favorite thing about IRC
[22:26:45] <LjL> Carl_GE, private channels are just the same as public channels except they have more obscure names, or are set +s (which means they won't show up in the channel list), or are even +i (which means invite-only). private messages aren't channels at all, they are just a conversation that happens directly between two users. in many clients, it's in a tab with the name of the other user
[22:26:50] <Carl_GE> ah I can see a bit more clearly now (John Denver)
[22:26:50] <huf> Carl_GE: you can /join #fiszfasz and it'll most likely be empty
[22:27:05] <huf> you can register it if you want
[22:27:27] <huf> there are rules for what names you can register, maybe you can only get ##fiszfasz? :)
[22:27:47] <m00nl1ght> i'm wondering can people like mods see what's going on there?
[22:28:12] <LjL> "mods" and "rooms" aren't actually IRC terms
[22:28:24] <m00nl1ght> OPs, sorry
[22:28:40] <LjL> there are "op(erator)s", "channels", and the ones that are the administration of the entire network are called "staff" on Libera, but generally "opers" or "ircops".
[22:28:54] <LjL> not OPs. ops. "OPs" with capitals means Original Poster and is quite unrelated.
[22:29:09] <m00nl1ght> oh
[22:29:13] <m00nl1ght> nvm
[22:29:36] <Carl_GE> nvm?
[22:29:37] <LjL> anyway, ops cannot see into channels they're not in, and definitely not into private messages. some staff have potentially the ability to see that but to the best of anyone's knowledge, they don't
[22:29:44] <LjL> nvm is short for "nevermind"
[22:29:51] <Carl_GE> ah thx

[23:02:48] <joel135> how would you translate the distinction "connaissance -- savoir" or "kennen -- wissen" into english?
[23:03:02] <joel135> preferably just one word each
[23:03:16] <joel135> seems like both are just "know"
[23:05:07] <LjL> hmm, there is a knowledge/wisdom distinction but it's not quite the same
[23:05:49] <joel135> i think this is like "knowing like you know a person" vs "knowing for a fact"
[23:05:52] <energizer> can you give some example usages?
[23:05:57] <LjL> ultimately the commonly understood word for them *is* know(ledge) for both. i don't know how to convey the distinction without using multiple words and/or being restricted in turn to one out of multiple meanings
[23:06:14] <apsxow> joel135: to be acquainted with; to recognize
[23:06:19] <joel135> right now i am using "understanding" for the former but i think it is not good
[23:06:39] <LjL> joel135, i think that's one of the possibilities... yes i was also thinking "be acquainted with", which can be good for people *and* for things, it's not a single word but so far it was the closest i could think of
[23:06:47] <joel135> thanks, i think i will use "acquaintance"
[23:06:55] <apsxow> joel135: to know about something; to remember; to realize
[23:07:00] <LjL> "acquaintance" on its own may be a bit ambiguous
[23:07:16] <LjL> "understanding" does also seem like it's making a different distinction
[23:07:30] <LjL> although in german at least, i think "kennen" also covers understanding
[23:07:56] *** Quits: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:08:07] <LjL> but in french... well i don't actually know what it's like in french, but the cognates in italian, "conoscenza" (connaissance) and "sapere" (savoir), do not really cover understanding ("capire")
[23:08:35] <joel135> oh you're right, it may be ambiguous.. but i think in this case it is clear, since it is an explicit written contrast between the two senses of "know", as in simply "acquaintance -- knowledge"

[23:51:17] <cth> right, and that's cuz it sounds casual and informal
