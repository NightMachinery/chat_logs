[17:11:45] <Forsaken87_> Hey there. Can someone with more ffmpeg knowledge have a look at this issue https://github.com/ForsakenNGS/raspi-plex-transcode/issues/1 and provide some ideas? It seems that the "Invalid data found when processing input" message covers a lot of problems which makes it quite hard to find a solution. (Of course I tried anyway, but couldn't find anything useful so far)
[17:15:08] <Forsaken87_> If no solution even some insight on what the issue is would already help me. Note there is a second (different) commandline example in the last comment which results in the same error. The common elements seem to be the "h264_v4l2m2m" encoder paired with "matroska". If I use "h264" or "libx264" it works fine.

[17:49:07] <BtbN> Quick sanity check: If I want to map all but the first audio stream, I do "-map 0 -map -0:a:0"?
[17:50:05] <BtbN> Ideally I'd want a mapping that's mapping exactly the last-most audio channel. But I don't think that's possible?
[17:50:20] <BtbN> i.e. 0:a:0 if there's one, 0:a:1 if there's two, and so on
[17:51:05] <furq> yes to the first question
[17:52:25] <furq> don't think there's anything nicer than running ffprobe first to do the other thing
[17:52:38] <BtbN> that's not possible, since it's a live stream being streamed in via rtmp
[17:53:13] <furq> you could maybe do something horrible like -map 0:a:9? -map 0:a:8? ... and then pipe to another ffmpeg and use -map 0:a:0
[17:53:38] <BtbN> Ugh, no. I'll just hardcope it and change the commandline whenever we change the input
[17:53:45] <furq> sounds sensible

[18:30:24] <JEEB> BtbN: sounds like you want a specific logic in the API client :s
[18:31:46] <BtbN> What API client?
[18:31:50] <BtbN> It's just nginx running ffmpeg
[18:32:39] <JEEB> I mean, ffmpeg.c is in this case the API client
[18:33:10] <JEEB> of course what you did is probably for the best if the stream might be temporary or change in the future
[18:34:23] <JEEB> basically, the spot where it starts making sense to start adding your business logic into your own copy of ffmpeg.c, rather than ending up with command lines that don't work
[18:34:51] <JEEB> that negative map thing does sound interesting, though
[18:35:08] <BtbN> negative map is already implemented and working fine
[18:35:12] <JEEB> ah, ok
[18:35:28] <BtbN> It's just re-streaming to Twitch, and locally recording
[18:35:49] <BtbN> Twitch has a so-called "VOD Audio Stream", where you can mute copyrighted music on, and other stuff you want on stream, but not on the recording
[18:36:12] <BtbN> Channel 0 is the stream-audio, 1 the VOD-Audio
[18:36:20] <JEEB> funky
[18:36:22] <BtbN> But obviously if there is no VOD-Audio, you want to record Stream-Audio instea
