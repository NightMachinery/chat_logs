[22:43:19] <rahl> getting segfault when immediately starting mutt
[22:44:17] <rahl> however this is on a shared system where I don't have admin privileges, and looks like mutt was not compiled with debug flag
[22:44:27] <rahl> so I'm not sure if submitting a core dump will be much use
[22:48:37] <lispmacs[work]> rahl: does it work for other users?
[22:54:47] <rahl> lispmacs[work]: yes. sorry I should have mentioned
[22:59:29] <kevin8t8> rahl: what version of mutt?
[23:00:23] <rahl> kevin8t8: 2.1.3
[23:00:47] <rahl> on NetBSD 9.1
[23:01:07] <kevin8t8> rahl: have to run, but gather what info you can and submit a ticket.
[23:01:30] <rkta> rahl: Does it also happen with 'mutt -F /dev/null'?
[23:22:55] <rahl> kevin8t8: ack, will do
[23:23:03] <rahl> rkta: yes
[23:27:39] <rkta> rahl: to be clear, it works for other users, but not for you?
[23:28:40] <rkta> if it also happens with -F /dev/null it should not be a problem with your config. Do you use some 'special' setup? shell, environment?
[23:29:02] <rahl> rkta: yes. According to a few other users I've spoken with
[23:29:26] <rahl> good to know it's likely not re config
[23:29:43] <rahl> I use tmux with bash, so nothing major
[23:29:50] <rahl> I also tried without tmux; same issue
[23:36:13] <rkta> rahl: could you try with a different shell or otherwise clean environment?
[23:39:23] <rahl> rkta: good call. Used `chsh` to switch and reconnected - no longer segfaulting
[23:42:34] <rkta> rahl: great! now with the working setup, if you run 'bash --noprofile --norc' you should get a clean bash. Does mutt segfault then?

[23:51:13] <rahl> rkta: I just tried renaming .bashrc with .bak and opened another ssh session
[23:51:19] <rahl> mutt worked fine
[23:51:31] <rahl> so I've just got something messed up in my bashrc
[23:51:40] <rahl> thank you a lot for the help
[23:54:17] <rkta> rahl: it would be interesting to know what in your bashrc leads to a segfault. Generally speaking a segfault is always a bug. Could you split your bashrc in half, try one half, if mutt crashes, split again and so on?
[23:54:22] <rahl> rkta: solved. Had $TERM set to tmux-256color
[23:54:42] <rahl> works fine with xterm-256color
[23:55:09] <rkta> rahl: if you set TERM to something different it works?
[23:55:39] <rahl> yes. xterm-256color behaves as expected
[23:56:26] <rkta> interesting
[23:57:11] <rahl> indeed
