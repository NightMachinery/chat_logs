[20:14:46] <lantech19446> don't really have time to converse right now but that's a hell of a book list you guys got here. I'm definitely gonna try to hit some of them, I've already read the pheonix project and thoroughly enjoyed that one.

[22:21:01] <lantech19446> so many people here and no one talking :(
[22:23:27] <rawtaz> yep
[22:23:39] <rawtaz> been quiet lately
[22:24:13] <lantech19446> I'll change that if i can lol I'm not in devops yet but i want a position with linux so apparently this is where i need to point my career
[22:25:04] <rawtaz> do you have somewhere you work where you can practice devops for real? i find it hard to do without some actual real use cases
[22:25:53] <lantech19446> I'm a sys admin in a small public library, i've automated the one daily task i could, setup prtg in the last week and now i'm working on an mdm
[22:26:03] <lantech19446> not sure what else i can really do though
[22:26:04] <rawtaz> :D
[22:26:18] <rawtaz> yeah you kind of need some development workflow to automate and operate
[22:26:49] <rawtaz> so if you dont have anything real in this context at work or similar, i guess you have to set it up in a lab environment at home or what not
[22:27:24] <lantech19446> yea kinda hard to automate changing a tape in a server lol, i need to become more proficient with bash and maybe python for scripting and i'm studying linux in a more in depth manner right now
[22:28:04] <rawtaz> just start using it instead :)
[22:28:11] <rawtaz> learn what you need as you need it
[22:29:04] <lantech19446> i've been using it since 2005 but i'm still an end user on it I run a linux server at work and i have a red hat vps so i'm trying to do more real world stuff on them and i feel like i'm getting better at it
[22:29:53] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Get a job somewhere, jump right into the deep end, that will teach you everything you need to know right away :)
[22:30:02] <kwilczynski> Sink or swim :P
[22:30:13] <kwilczynski> (might not be a good approach, though)
[22:30:47] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: To be serious - use the serenity and relative calm of your current job, to work on some side projects and/or Open Source (it's very easy to start contributing) to hone onto new skills.
[22:30:49] <rawtaz> i second that, if you can get a job where the type of stuff you want to get more into are done then thats good. hard to learn by just testing stuff yourself
[22:31:08] <rawtaz> yeah just setting up workflows on github and other places might be useful
[22:31:17] <rawtaz> theres a lot of that in open source software, or at least should be :>
[22:31:38] <kwilczynski> If I didn't have to do a full time job + on-call, which can be very intense... I would just solely devote myself to my hobby (tinkering in the kernel).
[22:31:51] <lantech19446> i would be petrified to just jump right in if i lost that job my wife and i would be homeless and within a couple weeks shed be dead
[22:32:08] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: I assume you are in the U.S.?
[22:32:15] <lantech19446> i'm also not a dev by any stretch that's where i need the most work i'm mainly ops 
[22:32:18] <lantech19446> yes
[22:32:25] <kwilczynski> You folks have it rough there with all the medical insurance shenanigans.
[22:32:43] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Being a "dev" is a mindset, not a lifestyle. :)
[22:33:01] <lantech19446> ok well to put it simply the only other language i  know is french
[22:33:16] <kwilczynski> I will fight this notion of "Ops people can't code" with fire until I die. And I will die on this hill lonely... but it will be worth it.
[22:33:49] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: No worries. Pick language you like... that clicks with you.
[22:34:10] <lantech19446> I don't know if i can or not the last time i tried i was unmedicated and have major depression and bipolar i'm doing things now that just weren't possible 5yrs ago
[22:34:24] <kwilczynski> And don't immediately assume that you need to be proficient from day-1, write idiomatic code and follow TDD, etc. Who cares. Get things done is more important. :)
[22:34:40] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: You can do it!
[22:35:23] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: I live (which is an oxymoron given what is coming next) with a terminal illness. If I can do things, you can do things. rawtaz can do things, so you can do things too. :)
[22:35:27] <kwilczynski> Go team lantech19446 !
[22:35:34] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: its not about whether a person who cant code is an ops person or not, its just about whether you can code or note, regardless of what you do otherwise :o
[22:35:48] <rawtaz> i wasnt aware there was some saying ops people cant code?
[22:35:55] <kwilczynski> Oh happens all the time.
[22:36:21] <rawtaz> i guess maybe those that arent programmers at all cant code and when they try to get into devops writing scripts and other types of automation it can get ugly, that would make sense
[22:36:38] <rawtaz> most of them can probably learn to code just like those that already know how to code :o
[22:36:49] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: There is a different between ability to code/write code and having been doing this for 10+ years.
[22:36:53] <kwilczynski> :)
[22:36:58] <rawtaz> yeah
[22:37:21] <lantech19446> my big concern would be whether i'm writing clean code that would be acceptable in a professional setting
[22:37:25] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: are you suggesting that youre going to leave is in the near future? :/
[22:37:30] <kwilczynski> For the latter, such people don't usually look for "devops" jobs. :)
[22:37:59] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I might have just maybe few years left.
[22:38:05] <rawtaz> lantech19446: heh, you'd be surprised how much complete junk code there is out there in "professional" settings. just do what you can to get it right, dont worry about how it compares to others' code
[22:38:07] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Two? Three? Hard to say.
[22:38:26] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Oh trust me... companies produce such utter shit often...
[22:38:43] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: i really dont like that, you are such a nice and kind person from what ive seen. i hope that in the end it will not be too painful.
[22:38:43] <lantech19446> lol ok
[22:38:52] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: When you look at their front page, you don't see the cobwebs and spiders that powers it.
[22:39:11] <rawtaz> lantech19446: to be blunt - it's *really* bad. so much complete crap out there
[22:39:26] <rawtaz> the fact that you seem to care about code quality pretty much already put you ahead of the rest.
[22:39:26] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I am not sure :) People who died from the condition didn't really share their post-death experiences :P
[22:39:32] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: I'm guessing you're in Poland by your name, is there really no one in Europe that can help you?
[22:40:17] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: I am in Poland, indeed. The problem is that modern medical science is unable to treat pulmonary hypertension with any modicum of success.
[22:40:40] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: In other words - there is no cure, just treatment that manages/slows down the progression of the condition.
[22:40:46] <lantech19446> usually just meds to lower it as much as they can right?
[22:40:51] <kwilczynski> Yes.
[22:41:11] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: :)
[22:41:51] <kwilczynski> No worries folks. It is what it is :)
[22:42:26] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: So, what sort of work you are looking to be doing? Given that you are looking, I gather you are interested in learning more about other things and gaining some new skills.
[22:42:44] <rawtaz> yeah it is what it is and one can only do what one can to find treatments, but theres a limit to that ability, especially when in some cases one has to battle the system and lack of understanding and/or knowledge. it doesnt always work out
[22:43:24] <lantech19446> kwilczynski: ideally i want to be a linux admin
[22:43:45] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: That profession is slowly fading away...
[22:43:51] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: In the old-fashioned sense of it.
[22:44:29] <rawtaz> yeah, thats no longer a thing pretty much
[22:44:36] <kwilczynski> Modern "ops people" or proper systems/infrastructure/operations people as I tend to call them... are a mixture of many skills.
[22:44:38] <lantech19446> yea so the people in red hat tell me, i was pointed to devops by quite a few of them who said in order to do the sort of work i want to do i need to learn scripting and cloud
[22:44:43] <rawtaz> its quite rare to see people looking for it, even if it still exists a bit
[22:45:24] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Not a thing for past 5 years or so. Some very old companies and/or small places and NGOs sometimes still look for Linux systems administrators to look after some legacy systems.
[22:45:27] <rawtaz> lantech19446: the key thing is to just start setting up and configuring and automating services and workflows. then you naturally get into the software and tech you need to use for it, and learn them
[22:45:44] <kwilczynski> But I haven't seen a role like that come across my field of view in a while.
[22:45:57] <lantech19446> i just figured it was my area when i was looking for them
[22:46:58] <rawtaz> linux should just be one of the tools in your toolbox, not something that your entire skill revolves around. unless youre doing some very specific things with it such as embedded or kernel/driver dev
[22:47:12] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: The key is to stay curious. For example: how do people interact with a cloud like AWS? Oh I see there is web UI and this Terraform thing. Let's have a look at both... so Terraform is this software to deterministically define infrastructure in a form of some template... code... how does it do it? how does it work?
[22:47:29] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: And then you will be learning plethora of things along the way..
[22:47:31] <rawtaz> yeah curiouus but also just start setting things up and work with it
[22:47:59] <kwilczynski> Yeah, true... nowadays knowing OS internals is not really required.
[22:48:10] <kwilczynski> Unless you are either old like me or curious about how things tick. :)
[22:48:17] <rawtaz> here's a roadmap that IMO isnt to be used for "oh i gotta learn all this" but it gives a pretty good overview of what's common these days: https://roadmap.sh/devops
[22:48:20] <rawtaz> lantech19446: ^
[22:48:48] <kwilczynski> The most important skills of all: ability to Google shit out of everything. :)
[22:49:07] <rawtaz> yeah. that is THE most important thing. being good at finding info, problems, solutions
[22:49:26] <lantech19446> ok bookmarked to look at when my head isn't pounding quite so much
[22:49:32] <rawtaz> in particular others having had the same or similar problems. because thats what you know and can search for - you cant really search for the solution since you dont know it yet
[22:49:41] <lantech19446> i'm pretty good at that part rawtaz it's pretty important for sys admin work too
[22:49:49] <rawtaz> very good
[22:49:54] <rawtaz> yeah indeed
[22:57:27] <lantech19446> i wonder if all MDM's are as much of a pain in the ass to work with as esper is
[22:58:12] <rawtaz> i dont have large environments but i try to avoid extra dependencies like that
[22:59:20] <lantech19446> this isn't a large environment i'm just trying to make my life easier than reinstalling these things every time they come back
[23:06:31] <rawtaz> ha! i gave up trying to make my life easy a long time ago ;-)
[23:11:35] <lantech19446> lol
[23:17:47] <lantech19446> i guess i'm a glutton for punishment lol
