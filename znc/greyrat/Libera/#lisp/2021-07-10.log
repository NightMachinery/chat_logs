[01:44:54] <moon-child> I think it's dumb that the list terminator is not self-evaluating (because really, what else is it gonna evaluate to?).  In cl, it's the symbol nil (or, if you want to be pedantic, COMMON-LISP:NIL), which evaluates to the symbol nil.

[02:06:31] <mdhughes> As for constants, you can't rebind a name inside a library (you can rename it in your import, but that doesn't change other uses of it).

[14:37:28] <lukego> I'm risking the wrath of the Common Lisp gods by using the GENERIC-CL package today. That's a wrapper around COMMON-LISP that makes all functions generic and various other cleanups / gratuitous incompatibilities. Handy for porting R code to CL when you want e.g. arithmetic to work on lists/vectors.
