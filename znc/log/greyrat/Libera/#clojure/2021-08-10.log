[00:08:12] <ToxicFrog> Sadly I don't think you can declare new ad hoc reader #macros
[00:13:15] <Para> Nope, that's not permitted by design.

[00:19:54] <technomancy> jeaye: clojure's refusal to add pattern matching is extremely frustrating
[00:20:02] <technomancy> what you're asking is completely reasonable but there's no way to do it
[00:25:38] <rovanion> I have never understood Riche's argument that it unnecicerily concretes parts of data in code that the code shouldn't have to know about.
[00:25:55] <Para> core.match is pretty good though, although I understand it's not all the way there
[00:26:05] <Para> with partials and all that stuff
[00:32:55] <Para> Maybe pattern matching is too new of an idea?
[00:33:40] <technomancy> lol... I doubt that
[00:34:49] <Para> "old man yells at progress of computer science"
[00:36:26] <rovanion> > Early programming languages with pattern matching constructs include COMIT (1957), SNOBOL (1962), Refal (1968) with tree-based pattern matching, Prolog (1972), SASL (1976), NPL (1977), and KRC (1981).
[00:37:13] <Para> SNOBOL, that has to be British
[00:37:41] <rovanion> Bell Labs apparently.
[00:38:02] <Para> Everything's from Bell Labs.
[00:38:19] <ridcully> snazzy cobol
[00:38:34] <Para> In fact just last week Nokia had a small buff piece about whatever-5G-it-was where they specifically mentioned that it was codevelopment with Bell.

[00:38:57] <Para> agh, I've been reading too much social media, I read that like one of those spongebob memes
[00:39:09] <Para> (it's my fourth week of vacation, I can barely remember my own name at this point)
[00:40:47] <sobel> i had 4 weeks of vacation in 2017
[00:41:02] <sobel> mainly because i left a job that gave me a nice severance
[00:43:27] <Para> We Finns get 24 workdays of vacation which we can semi-freely allocate (there are some recommendations), plus we have quite a few national holidays as well, although some of those might be on weekends so they obv. don't count as free days in such cases.
[00:44:13] <sobel> We Americans can't be told when to let our sla^H^H^Hemployees have time off, consequently no one gets time off
[00:44:19] <Para> 9 free holidays this year, double checked. These are dates like Christmas, Midsummer Eve, Good Friday...
[00:44:45] <sobel> one day i'll win at capitalism and then i can have a month off
[00:44:50] <sobel> hahahahahaha
[00:44:56] <rovanion> I think we are by law guaranteed to have 4 weeks of continuous summer vacation in Sweden.
[00:45:08] <Para> Yeah, this is one of those things which our terrible socialist ways have bestowed on us.
[00:45:46] <Para> I wouldn't mind having a sort of 5 months of work, 1 month off cycle.
[00:45:51] <sobel> ruins lives, etc
[00:45:53] <Para> Like sure fire me.
[00:46:32] <rovanion> Workers have right to 25 vacation days and at least 4 weeks of continuous vacation placed somewhere in June-July.
[00:47:05] <Para> I might be getting old or just not interested enough but I've actually been thinking of trying to shift into something like that :) Some people already do that, although it's relatively rare. Like, they're just _gone_ for 10 weeks of summer.
[00:48:07] <rovanion> I'll be starting my own business as an indepandant contractor this fall. Got a contract for October-January and then, perhaps, I'll just not work for a month. Doesn't sound that bad really.
[00:48:36] <rovanion> One of my colleagues did a long vacation this year, two months gonner.
[00:48:42] <Para> Yeah, friend of mine has been a private contractor for almost two years now.
[00:48:45] <Para> three, even
[00:49:00] <Para> He pretty much does that :)
[00:49:27] <Para> Although this year he's been obviously working a lot more because of the whole work from home thing. He just shifted his office to summer cottage and worked 50%.
[00:50:31] <Para> I've been thinking of the contractor thing myself as well, the situation for getting outsourced is pretty good these days without too much of a hassle, but I don't think I have the right kind of mind for that way of working.
[00:54:04] <rovanion> I'm taking the plunge but it feels scary, I'll give you that. But worst case, I figure, I'll just go back to a normal job with my 2 500€ share capital gone.

[03:05:32] <jeaye> Pretty please. :D
[03:06:16] <jeaye> malli is super cool, as an alternative to spec. Doesn't have cljs instrumentation yet, though.
[03:10:20] <selfsymmetric-mu> I actually meant to ask for cool companies people were working for, but this is interesting too! I am a big fan of property-based testing. In fact when I first used it to implement a module at work, I was stunned at how powerfully it found bugs. It changed how writing software worked for me; it made me redirect a lot of insight into simply coaxing the generators into the right search space.
[03:10:53] <selfsymmetric-mu> One of the most impressive new coding techniques I've learned in years.

[03:12:51] <selfsymmetric-mu> But maybe I'm looking at this too narrowly. I know spec can be used for property testing, but that might not be the focus of malli's schema definitions. Reading more now.
[03:13:39] <selfsymmetric-mu> Oh okay, I see now that it is more focused on data validation and transformation, rather than generation.

[03:24:44] <selfsymmetric-mu> Whoops, never mind, I found the "Motivation" section of the README.
[03:26:13] <jeaye> I've built and shipped multiple systems in spec. I think its macro-based syntax is limiting and its global mutable registery is unnecessary. malli is arguably simpler, in design, and more flexible, due to its data-oriented nature. To me, that feels much more Clojurey.
[03:27:00] <jeaye> I've also had issues with spec's performance and malli is consistently multiple times faster than spec in benchmarks.
[03:31:22] <lockdown> how does malli approaches (or not) the issue mentioned with spec in the "maybe not" talk?

[06:40:52] <jeaye> metosin/malli
[06:41:53] <jeaye> lockdown: Regarding the nesting and composition, note that, since malli schemas are just data, one could have a base schema with no nilables and then do the appropriate update-in to add :maybe where desirable. It ends up being much saner than with spec, anyway.
[06:42:35] <jeaye> But the metosin guy's argument for :maybe boiled down to practicality. It's a very practical thing to have, but it's a choice left up to you as to whether or not you'll use it.

[22:53:20] <andreyorst> is there any way to suppress test's output unless the test fails?
[22:53:49] <technomancy> andreyorst: we're starting to use kaocha at work which does that
[22:53:53] <technomancy> seems nice
[22:54:23] <andreyorst> I have some tests that throw and log some exception stack traces which get's my output in the compilation buffer really messy
[22:54:29] <andreyorst> technomancy: will look at it, thanks
[22:54:56] <ridcully_> yeah but on the other hand you basically can no longer println debug (i am still a kaocha user)
[22:55:30] <technomancy> we have had a never-ending battle of trying to suppress stack traces for tests which test error conditions and people always miss a spot and it drives me nuts. I think kaocha will finally let me rest.
[22:55:58] <andreyorst> ridcully_: I don't think I need to see debug info if the test succeeds :)
[22:56:13] <technomancy> the problem is it's easier to accidentally leave in a debug prn
[22:56:23] <andreyorst> rust has a good story on this imo, but they run tests in separate threads
[22:56:43] <technomancy> clojure.test is fine for defining tests but it's real bad for running them
[22:57:09] <technomancy> realizing those two jobs could be split was a big leap forward for the ecosystem I think
[22:58:46] <ridcully_> and it comes with some many nice things: better output, tagging your tests and focusing them, watch, ...
[22:59:52] <ridcully_> andreyorst: what i mean is, that you basically not longer can "debug" an infinite loop with println
[23:00:00] <Para> I wish kaocha had a better Leiningen plugin :/ the kind which actually uses project.clj to generate the actual kaocha config...
[23:00:44] <ridcully_> so instead of a dedicated file, read it from the place all other config is in?
[23:00:50] <Para> They used to have a separate plugin but that's deprecated now and not even listed, now it's just the alias. But that's not a big thing really.
[23:01:39] <andreyorst> ugh, so I can't set up kaocha to run tests as a universal thing, i.e. without modifying project.clj?
[23:01:42] <Para> ridcully_: Well yes, especially since I tend to work with projects with custom project layouts.
[23:02:06] <Para> andreyorst: you can :) I'm just a windmiller.
[23:03:40] <ridcully_> andreyorst: you can.  but then you are at the usual dilemma: what do people do, that don't have my user profile settings
[23:04:03] <ridcully_> so i have just added the two lines and the kaocha file in my lein template and be done with it
[23:07:08] <ridcully_> another "problem": rarely the diff of the failing test is utterly confusing
[23:07:48] <ridcully_> so for both my "complains" i'd wish there where some killswitch (e.g. some meta) to just disable all "bells and whistles" for this test and give me the hard truth about it
[23:08:06] <ridcully_> but then again, you can just easily run that stuff in the repl at that point
[23:08:16] <technomancy> Para: I think it's good that there's no lein plugin personally
[23:08:30] <technomancy> making it an alias to `lein run -m kaocha.whatever arg1 arg2` is much better
[23:13:44] <andreyorst> ridcully_: I only need it for myself, so I could run tests in a more comfortable way. I usually run those with CIDER, but some times I want to fire up M-x compile RET lein test RET and let it run in the background without fiddling with CIDER
[23:14:53] <ridcully_> i have it running in watchmode in projects continously
[23:15:28] <ridcully_> you can put this commands in your .lein/profiles.clj and that should work just fine
[23:15:43] <ridcully_> s/this/the kaocha/
[23:17:43] <Para> technomancy: I don't mind the alias, but I would like to have project.clj -> kaocha config generator thingy pluginified. As said, custom project layouts especially make it a bit annoying.
[23:18:14] <Para> I also kinda don't like the explosion of dotfiles in repositories, especially since every tool and framework seems to think they own the root dir :P
[23:18:30] <Para> (well, not every tool, but you get my point...)
[23:18:59] <technomancy> ah, yes putting the config file in the root instead of dev-resources is a bad design
[23:19:05] <technomancy> that has nothing to do with whether it's a plugin or not tho
[23:19:44] <technomancy> but you shouldn't write a plugin if you're not calling any leiningen functionality (which kaocha has no need for)

[23:26:41] <Para> Having a resolved project data structure available for kaocha config generation would require leiningen functionality, no?
[23:27:03] <Para> This is one of those things I _know_ doesn't really matter, btw :D very much a personal annoyance.

[23:28:44] <technomancy> hm; I don't see why it would need the project map

[23:37:05] <Para> Well, it relates to the custom project dir layouts, as I already mentioned. Also when eg. test dirs are specified in the dev profile only it would help to do it that way; kaocha also has profile support, so having synchronization between the two would be nice.
[23:37:19] <Para> Of course I completely understand this is a self-made complication :)
