[01:28:12] <sharpertool> Hi All. I've been working with MyISAM tables, but we are planing to convert them to InnoDB.
[01:28:32] <sharpertool> Referential integrity, row versus table locking.. stuff like that
[01:29:11] <sharpertool> But I'm used to being able to just copy those *large* .MYD, .MYI and .MYF files over to sync up a replication slave
[01:29:26] <sharpertool> with InnoDB.. that won't be possible. What are some of the other options?
[01:29:53] <sharpertool> I know mysqldump is one.. but that will be quite slow, relatively speaking I believe.
[01:30:03] <sharpertool> Using MySQLD 5.7

[19:36:58] <Isotopp> fraff: information_schema and performance_schema are not schemas in the normal sense of the word.
[19:37:36] <Isotopp> fraff: mysql and sys are normal schemas, almost. there is a bunch of secret objects in mysql.* in mysql 8 that are accessible only under special circumstances and during initial installation
[19:38:01] <Isotopp> both schemas are schemas that are subject to system updates, and when you put your own stuff in there it may (and will) collide with updates you apply
[19:38:35] <Isotopp> that is, create an administrative schema for your company or project, and put your administrative objects into this.
