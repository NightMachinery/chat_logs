[00:39:17] <jneira[m]> michaelpj: yeah i think copy the config will be fine
[00:39:31] <michaelpj[m]> okay, I'll give that a try
[00:40:38] <jneira[m]> and install the app! it seems it is not enabled
[00:41:58] <jneira[m]> installed
[01:16:44] <michaelpj[m]> jneira: windows CI seems to be quite flaky, fails a lot with things like `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ghc3B4D.o.tmp: renameFile:renamePath:MoveFileEx "\\\\?\\C:\\Users\\RUNNER~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ghc3B4D.o.tmp" Just "\\\\?\\C:\\Users\\RUNNER~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ghc3B4D.o": does not exist (The system cannot find the file specified.)`
[01:16:50] <michaelpj[m]> seen this before?
[01:17:01] <michaelpj[m]> does seem to be non-deterministic
[01:20:04] <jneira[m]> i've seen it in the hls repo for ghc-9.0
[01:20:30] <jneira[m]> 1/6 or so
[01:22:50] <michaelpj[m]> bah
[01:22:56] <michaelpj[m]> I guess we'll just wait for it to go away

[11:49:39] <mpickering> I think I am seeing the new behaviour fendor was talking about auto completing leading to imports being added
[11:49:49] <mpickering> the issue for me if that it chooses the wrong import and starts causing module loops
[11:50:12] <fendor> that is pretty bad
[11:50:19] <fendor> why would it import itself?
[11:50:19] *** Joins: arrowd (~arr@2.93.55.66)
[11:50:30] <mpickering> It doesn't import itself
[11:50:36] <mpickering> but some other module which leads to a loop
[11:51:12] <jneira[m]> ya, completions are too fuzzy to add imports so easily
[11:51:14] <fendor> ah, yeah that is also not ideal
[12:09:11] <mpickering> now it imported a redundant import it seems
[12:09:34] <mpickering> I disabled it now so no more bug reports from me !
[12:14:19] <wz1000> is this a plugin or completions in general?
[12:14:50] <wz1000> I'm pretty sure my client doesn't support the additional text edits property used for adding imports.

[16:09:25] <michaelpj[m]> wz1000: extending imports doesn't use additionalTextEdits, but rather the extra command on completionItem, which lets you do expensive stuff when the completion is applied without using completionItem/resolve
[16:09:29] <michaelpj[m]> or at least that's my understanding
[16:09:43] <michaelpj[m]> and I think the extra command support is older so probably more clients handle it

[20:41:33] <myShoggoth> Now that I have a custom built HLS working on non-HLS projects, I was thinking I might start learning the codebase by figuring out why running HLS on HLS seems to barf. I'm not seeing anything reasonable in logs, is there a recommended approach?
[20:54:26] <jneira[m]> uh, what are the symptoms, no working feature?
[21:05:26] <myShoggoth> it crashes (The Haskell (haskell-language-server) server crashed 5 times in the last 3 minutes. The server will not be restarted.)
[21:13:42] <wz1000> the logs go to stderr
[21:14:13] <jneira[m]> and the log of executing `haskell-language-server -d ./exe/Main.hs` (or hls-wrapper) in a shell ?
[21:14:48] <jneira[m]> wz1000: yeah, if you are using vscode there is some log from the client side which might be useful too
