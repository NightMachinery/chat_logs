[00:00:18] <canton7> No need
[00:00:20] <MaNa2k> biberu, yea thats what im trying
[00:00:23] <MaNa2k> with a selct first
[00:00:30] <canton7> There's no need to put a Select in
[00:00:38] <MaNa2k> because the key is just an id incrementing
[00:00:47] <canton7> Just .ToDictionary(x => x.SomeKey, x => ConvertObjAToObjB(b))
[00:01:01] <canton7> What you would have put in the Select just goes in the 2nd arg to ToDictionary
[00:01:28] <MaNa2k> canton7, yes, but convertobjatob am i suppose to do that manually ?
[00:01:47] <canton7> Well I can't tell you how to convert an obj_A into an obj_B...
[00:02:10] <MaNa2k> well they are very similar
[00:02:25] <MaNa2k> objB has slight variations like nested properties
[00:02:39] <biberu> can't you just make a small mapping function?
[00:02:49] <canton7> Oh right, I forgot you could just tell the compiler "They are very similar", and it would guess what to do
[00:03:05] <MaNa2k> biberu, yes i would do that normally, was just trying to see if i can do this automagically since the property names are the same
[00:03:48] <canton7> There are tools you might be able to use, like AutoMapper and friends, but the language doesn't give you anything
[00:04:13] <MaNa2k> hmm i see
[00:04:18] <MaNa2k> oki thanks for advice guys
[00:04:26] <biberu> would try to avoid the temptation of such tools, it's not much fun when they fail at runtime
[00:04:29] <MaNa2k> i think ill just do it the old fashion way

[00:22:51] <kennyd> fries are one of the few things I know how to make well. crispy on the outside, soft in the middle
[00:23:02] <_genuser_> redoc I'll put oregano in a bowl (bottled oregano from walmart), and crush it with a spoon. as much as you can, nothing too much. then sprinkle on teh fries as you take them out.

[02:43:49] <bomb> anyone does?
[02:44:26] <DevJohnC> bpmedley, I didn't but the short answer is that working with existing javascript libraries is too much hassle and there's a lack of mature UI component libraries that make developing a webapp quick or easy
[02:44:55] <bpmedley> Thanks for sharing.  What is your current personal preference for web ui?
[02:46:09] <DevJohnC> I don't have a strong preference for anything in particular; anything that natively supports typescript out of the box and has a decent collection of UI components is good
[02:46:40] <DevJohnC> so, next.js or reactjs if you don't need UI components, something like Vaadin if you want UI components and some backend support (warning: it's java)
[02:46:53] <BtbN> I liked working with extJS. But their licensing is a bit iffy

[09:45:08] <tsujp> I have a POCO which has a number of `public static string` properties called `foo` with value `FOO`, `bar` with value `BAR` etc and then a `Explaination` property with `[StringEnumValidator("FOO", "BAR", "BAZ")]`. This allows me to provide information on what the value `FOO` on `Explanation` means, because you can see property `foo` and the
[09:45:08] <tsujp> associated docstring. I want to convert this over to use bitflags instead as options are no longer mutually exclusive. I can see the `EnumDataType` attribute but I don't know how to pass it property `foo` `bar` and `baz` and have it create a bitflag enum of 0, 1, 2 respectively (adding a 4th would make 4, a 5th make 8, a 6th make 16 etc)
[09:45:10] <tsujp> How do you do this?

[11:29:33] <tsujp> Okay yet another question
[11:30:51] <tsujp> I'm attempting to run an ef migration and getting `No suitable constructor was found for entity type 'VirtualNetworkPurpose'. The following constructors had parameters that could not be bound to properties of the entity type: cannot bind 'purpose' in 'VirtualNetworkPurpose(Guid virtualNetworkId, Purposes purpose)'.` -- such a constructor _does_
[11:30:52] <tsujp> exist (the solution even builds completely); is this because Purpose (which is an enum) doesn't conform to EF conventions? Do I need to add something to DbContext?
[11:31:31] <biberu> tsujp: does VirtualNetworkPurpose have a default constructor?
[11:31:56] <tsujp> A default constructor meaning one with no parameters right? If so, then it does not
[11:32:57] <tsujp> Adding a default constructor worked, nice
[11:33:15] <tsujp> But I have marked certain properties are [Required] so that concerns me?
[11:33:40] <biberu> tsujp: ime ef entities work best as simple dtos, just let them tell ef what you want and what kind of relations etc. you have, then you can map between those and more robust types that you expose to the rest of the application
[11:35:53] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[11:35:56] <tsujp> Hmm this is simple though i feel. `Purposes` is just a string enum with 4 possible values. Surely EF can handle that either as a constraint on the column or with the enums as their own table and then a FK constraint on the column to that other table
[11:36:23] <tsujp> I should have mentioned too VirtualNetworkPurpose is a POCO which is eventually DbSet<VirtualNetworkPurpose> in ApplicationDbContext
[11:36:30] <biberu> tsujp: as an example, if you added that constructor to prevent a developer from initializing VirtualNetworkPurpose in an invalid state i'd probably have that as two classes, one internal for ef to use, and one public that's part of the domain that you construct elsewhere and map to/from
[11:37:05] <kobo>  oh lord, we just got asked by management to think about how we write code so our servers dont release so much co2
[11:37:25] <biberu> tsujp: that'd prevent leaking database concerns to the rest of the application, allow you to separate business rules etc.
[11:37:29] <tsujp> How do you define a constructor on a POCO which is eventually DbSet such that that constructor is private to EF only?
[11:38:01] <biberu> tsujp: you might get away with just making the default constructor internal too
[11:38:19] <biberu> tsujp: but as i said, i'd hesitate to expose the entities to the entire world
[11:38:49] <tsujp> In this case these entities are only used internally
[11:39:06] <tsujp> There's another EntitiyService which uses it, and any public dtos are furhter used by another ASP.NET project
[11:39:45] <tsujp> So we've got (1) a project which just defines entities as POCOs (2) an entity service project which uses those entities and has business logic (3) any of these which need public exposure done through an ASP.NET API
[11:39:58] <biberu> yeah, that's not what i mean
[11:40:10] <biberu> when i say internal i mean internal to an assembly that's concerned only with ef
[11:42:10] <tsujp> An assembly is by default a project right? Unless that project has specially been configured to have multiple assemblies?
[11:42:40] <tsujp> Like the assembly is the runtime for a specific _thing_ by default that _thing_ is just a project
[11:42:48] <tsujp> Could have projects with N assemblies?
[11:44:43] <biberu> yeah, a project, so in my example you might have e.g. one project "Domain" that contains a *public* class VirtualNetworkPurpose, and another project "EF" that contains an *internal* class VirtualNetworkPurposeEntity, and logic to map between the two

[13:47:26] <planetcalls|work> Now, there is a way to force reload the variables in Powershell but VS may still require restart of the app.

[15:58:10] <kobo> what's the recommended way to manage databases? is it database project in visual studio? our different db's are starting to diff more and more per day..

[15:59:26] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[16:04:07] <jmer> kobo: depends on your needs.
[16:05:13] <kobo> jmer, we use azure devops for code and deployments to different environments, and ideally we'd like something like that, but for db schema changes
[16:05:20] <jmer> kobo: if you have no type of migrations and you simply need a tool to catch DB drift and fix it, I would probalby just use the DB projects in VS because they spit out dacpacs and have tooling to help you fix drift by comparing database instances
[16:05:42] <jmer> the db projects can also be deployed/applied in a pipeline through usage of sqlpackage.exe
[16:06:34] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: I also hate when you add a new method, and git insists that you added { public void Foo() }
[16:06:43] <Nasp> Which makes merges even worse
[16:06:50] <jmer> kobo: from what I can see the biggest difference between  the VS DB projects and i.e. EF Migrations is that the DB projects kinda run isolated from your code, so you can't change parts of a db based on a feature flag in your application.
[16:07:53] <jmer> kobo: also the db projects kinda expects you to know SQL and stuff like that so if you have "EF Only" devs... They will insist on never helping you :P
[16:13:48] <kobo> jmer:we don't have EF now, and do alot of heavy stuff in sprocs, so these changes we would like to keep track of and be able to migrate on deploy if possible
[16:14:12] <kobo> because right now, we manually create scripts and deploy them manually

[16:14:24] <kobo> which is dreadful and very error prone
[16:14:36] <jmer> kobo: Yeah I think it would be better to import your DB into a VS db project and then do changes through that
[16:14:58] <jmer> because it can, as I said, be deployed as part of your pipeline and the db's state will be stored in version control
[16:15:35] <jmer> but you have to keep discipline and only make changes through that project, the days of just hooking up Management studio and changing there should be over :P
[16:18:29] <kobo> jmer, how is the developer experience in such projects? I need to sell this to devs who really like using ssms
[16:18:30] *** Joins: Tazy (~Tazmainia@102-182-56-61.ip.airmobile.co.za)
[16:19:04] <jmer> kobo: it's closer to SQL. You have GUIs for most changes but it will generate a script for you that it then applies to the DB.
[16:19:45] <jmer> but "we like using SSMS" is a very, very weak argument for not controlling your DB deployments in a proper way
[16:19:57] <kobo> jmer, i agree but people are stubborn :D
[16:20:21] <kobo> right.. we currently only have 1 shared dev-db, instead of local instances, would we need to get local instances as well for db projects to work good?
[16:20:38] <jmer> kobo: they can be stubborn all they want, if they have no proper arguments for their way of working they should simply be forced to do stuff correctly xD
[16:21:02] <jmer> kobo: no matter what tool/method you use for DB deployment I always recommend local developer dbs
[16:21:03] <kobo> jmer, yep, but it's way easier if the team in agreement want to work in a specific way
[16:21:25] <jmer> I've too often seen that Joe Developer's DDL changes fucks up Developer Sue's current work
[16:21:47] <jmer> kobo: sure. But I think demoing how easy you can deploy from a vs project and that you can script it out with sqlpackage will convince a lot of people
[16:22:07] <jmer> kobo: the alternative in SSMS is to set it up to generate change scripts and manually save those and create some mechanism that applies them in the right order
[16:22:50] <Tazy> Hi all, given a byte[] , how do I get the size in kB?  from it ?
[16:23:06] <kobo> Alright, I'll try to spin up a demo. So what's needed for this approach is local dbs, and then add a db project to the git repo
[16:23:22] <kobo> Tazy, isn't it just size and *1000?
[16:23:23] <jmer> kobo: it's not a requirement. Just a recommendation from me :P

[16:43:17] <MatthiasVance> Ah so you rubbed them a bit and that was it?
[16:44:38] <Tazy> caffeine helps the eyes lubricate themselves internally
[16:45:11] <irwiss> you make tea, like you do normally, then leave the bags to cool down, then just put on eyes for a few mins... there's probably more to it but that was enough for me, gave better results than any moisturizing eye drops that i tried

[17:02:59] <jmer> MatthiasVance: the agenda with this meeting is us asking an external dev company why they have designed their solution to put maximum amount of work on us xD

[17:11:34] <MatthiasVance> Asking or demanding they change it? xD
[17:12:52] <jmer> Well
[17:13:02] <jmer> I'm certainly going to ask them why they are suggesting this solution
[17:13:14] <jmer> they have added weird constraints like "we can't call APIs through API management"
[17:13:21] <jmer> and "We can't call REST APIs"
[17:13:43] <jmer> and... "We want to send parameters to a web UI, using XML"
[17:16:46] <MatthiasVance> HEH
[17:16:47] <MatthiasVance> :D
[17:18:53] <edcba> haha
[17:18:56] <Kim^J> jmer: "We can provide you with a custom API just for you, but we will charge an hourly rate of X with minimum Y hours. KTHXBYE!"
[17:19:12] <edcba> who is paying whom ?
[17:19:18] <jmer> edcba: I am not sure
[17:19:22] <jmer> I will find out tomorrow
[17:19:36] <edcba> it's a "partnership" i guess :D
[17:19:39] <jmer> It's not inherently obvious because both companies would win by this solution
[17:19:55] <jmer> and by win I mean earn extra
[17:23:04] <jmer> Funnily enough it's a comapny that needs to do a Revit Addin

[17:26:44] <jmer> If the ServiceCollection has a logger registered, and some 3rd party component requests an ILogger it should "just work" (assuming they are using the same servicecollection)
[17:27:11] <SKull> guys, if anyone of you is thinking about getting Apple's streaming service to watch 'Invation', don't. it's the dumbest thing i've seen in decades. and i'm usually a sucker for anything alien related.
[17:27:44] <jmer> SKull: I considdered getting it so I could watch Foundation
[17:28:08] <SKull> jmer: Foundation is cool. especially visually.
[17:28:44] <SKull> jmer: although i did not read Azimovs books, so I don't know how good it is compared to the books. But it sure looks stunning!
[17:30:15] <jmer> SKull: I read the first one... Got captivated only to be bummed out about that all these people disappear and are never followed again in the later books
[17:31:59] <SKull> jmer: the tv show doesn't have that many main characters to begin with
[17:32:36] <SKull> jmer: i think i've read somewhere that the story of the tv show diverges greatly from the books. but again, i can't tell. but the end of season one didn't leave any lose paths
[17:32:59] <jmer> SKull: in the first book I think all of the main characters end up dying xD
[17:33:14] <SKull> then the tv show is definitely different
[17:33:52] <SKull> well, a couple of millions die in some incident, but those weren't characters

[17:46:28] <jonp> no

[18:00:19] <SKull> it's a figure of speech
[18:01:00] <Seng> edcba, the BitConverter class has a field, .IsLittleEndian

[18:19:03] <jonp> this "debate" has been going on *centuries*.
[18:19:11] <jonp> we need to vaccinate against *everything*.
[18:19:30] <SKull> jonp: yesterday i read a news headline. a nurse said that patients in ICU told her "i had no idea that it could get this bad!"
[18:19:40] <SKull> REALLY? AFTER TWO YEARS OF MEDIA COVERAGE YOU HAD NO IDEA?!
[18:19:49] <jonp> you think some people read the media?
[18:20:06] <jonp> my wife doesn't watch news.  usually too political, too depressing
[18:20:18] <bomb> media always tells the truth, right
[18:20:19] <SKull> jonp: they apparently read enough media to 'know' that the media isn't reliable and biased and should not be trusted in any case
[18:20:21] <jonp> she's also NOT anti-vax
[18:20:37] <jonp> SKull: part of the problem is that *nothing* should be trusted, which is indeed fair
[18:20:47] <jonp> …and then some people go off and instead trust BS artists who are clowns
[18:20:54] <jonp> which is…inconsistent?
[18:21:04] <SKull> jonp: right, you should be sceptic about everything you read. that includes the conspiracy bullshit they seem do devour like a bible

[18:22:26] <jonp> bomb: do you think the vaccine is more dangerous than COVID?
[18:22:46] <jonp> there's ample evidence that COVID is far worse
[18:22:57] <jonp> in which case, YES, we need to keep vaccinating
[18:22:59] <jonp> see also: the flu?

[18:23:19] <bomb> death rate for kids is 9 per million IF they comorbidity

[18:23:21] <SKull> jonp: long covid really is no joke. i know several people that know someone affected by it

[19:21:03] <blez`> SKull not exactly. China's doing well
[19:21:24] <blez`> if we get a proper vaccine, it _might_ stop the spread
[19:22:02] <SKull> blez`: china's doing well because they have the authority to send every person that came into contact as well as everyone they know into camps. you can't exactly do that in democracies ;)
[19:22:27] <SKull> blez`: turns out that totalitarian regimes do have upsides in certain situations (like a pandemic)
[19:22:35] <blez`> yep
[19:22:52] <SKull> blez`: but let's not forget that they also have downsides :]
[19:23:16] <bomb> China's vaccination rate is like 40%
[19:23:40] <blez`> and "democracies" or at least countries that allow people to talk antivax bullcrap on tv are doing quite bad nowdays

[19:24:34] <bomb> I don't think anyone's allowed to question vaccines on TV right now blez`
[19:24:57] <SKull> blez`: i'm swiss. i'm still expected to tolerate anti vaxxers because "everyone has the right to their own opinion". i somehow value that right, but it is definitely not good during a pandemic
[19:25:30] <SKull> ah well, every form of government  has its up- and downsides
[19:26:19] <SKull> that's why i'd be ok with a strict NO ICU BED policy for those who don't want the vaccine. you don't want it? fine, live with the consequences...$
[19:26:20] <blez`> SKull I'm from Bulgaria. Vaccination rate ~30%. Similar to Russia everyone are antivaxxers and that's all what the media is talking about
[19:26:40] <blez`> so, absolute freedom isn't always good

[19:27:11] <blez`> we had, last year

[19:27:41] <SKull> jesus... it's just frustrating
[19:27:55] <blez`> it's the opposite of what should be done
[19:28:06] <SKull> indeed
[19:28:46] <SKull> the media here is mostly pro vaccine, but they still act as if the anti vaxxers actually have a leg to stand on. which they simply don't. and that rethorik is simply dangerous.

[19:30:45] <irwiss> SKull: the media, unless forced by government, is just chasing outrage because it's easy mode in generating eyeballs

[19:34:25] <SKull> blez`: i had friends over two weeks ago, they're from a rural anti vax area. they told me that they didn't vaccinate because they don't know what's in it. they also had about 400g of cocaine in one of their backpacks... and they are worried what they put into their bodies. they are no longer my friends.
[19:34:32] <edcba> blez`: privacy ?
[19:35:25] <SKull> edcba: the privacy argument only matters if you don't have a facebook or various other social media accounts. we gave up our privacy years ago.
[19:36:01] <edcba> well people may want to show their wedding but not when they are agonizing in icu
[19:36:44] <SKull> edcba: did i miss something? a covid certificate or a vaccine does in no way expose you being in an icu bed
[19:37:13] <bomb> lol
[19:37:13] <MatthiasVance> SKull: Here someone was selling COVID .. so that people wouldn't have to get vaccinated
[19:37:19] <edcba> a vaccine doesn't guarantee you not going into icu
[19:37:30] <edcba> and ppl may not be able to get vaccine
[19:37:39] <SKull> edcba: statisticly speaking, the vaccine does exactly that
[19:37:56] <bomb> I told you he's in 2020
[19:38:00] <edcba> yeah indeed
[19:38:02] <SKull> MatthiasVance: that is actually a reasonable approach. as long as those people don't want an icu bed if things go wrong, i'm fine with that
[19:38:26] <SKull> MatthiasVance: or compensation for long covid
[19:38:36] <MatthiasVance> But getting infected can lead to more infections =)
[19:38:38] <SKull> MatthiasVance: as long as they take full responsibility for what they do, go a head and get sick
[19:38:57] <MatthiasVance> So if 20% are saying sure we'll take the disease instead of the shot, that might also prove troublesome?
[19:39:09] <canton7> It's not just the individual though. Their families are the ones stuck looking after them if they don't have an ICU bed, and they might disagree with that individual's preferences...
[19:39:14] <MatthiasVance> ^
