[03:18:59] <ChrisM> YAY Thanks!
[03:19:37] <rewt> Dharhix, use the right function call to get the matches instead of doing a substitution -- this is language/tool-dependent, and outside the scope of the regex itself
[03:22:30] <Dharhix> I was afraid of that answer rewt. What I use doesn't do functions, it does substitutions like: "REGEX":"\1" where the result can be "", "\1", "\2", etc. Anyway, appreciated. :)

[03:49:11] <ChrisM> Can the regex be reworked so VSCode will accept it?
[03:49:53] <rewt> ChrisM, try this one: https://regex101.com/r/43mPbf/3
[03:50:07] <rewt> (also fixed the substitution text a bit)

[03:53:50] <ChrisM> Normally VSCode has no problem with my regex but I never usually try multi-line stuff

[10:56:43] <Me-me> Sorry, back.
[10:56:52] <Me-me> Oh, JohnDoe2 got it.
[10:56:59] <digitok> no, he's lazy
[10:57:06] <digitok> he said you'll rewrite it
[10:57:21] <JohnDoe2> basically (a|) matches any position because after the | alternate you have nothing, and nothing exists everywhere between characters
[10:57:32] <JohnDoe2> so that could also be a?
[10:57:40] <digitok> it's a secret way of doing a?
[10:57:45] <digitok> good one
[10:57:54] <digitok> now the noobs know
[10:57:58] <Me-me> I did mention it was oddly formatted.
[10:58:22] <Me-me> I didn't automatically remove it because I figured what if he needs to keep the group indexes straight in his language?
[10:58:40] <JohnDoe2> yes you did indeed uh huh oh yeah damn right you did I read it! ain't nobody gonna say it wasn't said cuz it was totally said. Like straight up.
[10:58:43] <Me-me> I guess you could do (a?)
[10:58:55] <Me-me> Look. I had to step away, okay.
[10:59:16] <JohnDoe2> hells yeah. Sometimes you gotta drop a load ya know?
[10:59:17] <digitok> you definitely did say it

[17:44:20] <CoolerX> https://regex101.com/r/U05Z6k/1
[17:45:04] <CoolerX> str.split(myregex) works as expected but it also produces an empty string at the end

[17:49:22] <CoolerX> hmm even 'abc'.split('c') gives an empty string at the end

[18:14:54] <re101-cuscus-24> https://regex101.com/r/rwoHSf/1 I don't want a match if the characters are between single or double quotes. How can I achieve this?
[18:17:24] <digitok> which programming language?
[18:18:23] <re101-cuscus-24> Python
[18:18:32] <digitok> right, duh
[18:18:34] <digitok> hehe
[18:18:46] <digitok> can you use the 'regex' module?
[18:19:06] <re101-cuscus-24> yes, that works with `import re`
[18:19:24] <digitok> i mean `import regex`
[18:19:27] <digitok> !py
[18:19:27] <perlbot> Please see https://pypi.org/project/regex/ for details on the 'regex' module with added functionality in Python.
[18:20:25] <zohoor> Thank you 
[18:20:29] <digitok> yw
[18:20:37] <zohoor> so this code can give me all words listed?
[18:20:41] <re101-cuscus-24> I didn't try `import regex`I only know re
[18:21:12] <digitok> yea, i think you need to install it
[18:21:30] <digitok> 07zohoor, yes, assuming you don't want to match partial words
[18:21:38] <re101-cuscus-24> I'm testing online at regex101, I will implement it later in Python.
[18:22:05] <digitok> 07re101-cuscus-24, sure, i can give you the solution, but it will require the regex module
[18:22:12] <digitok> it won't work with import re
[18:22:33] <zohoor> no, I am looking for exact words
[18:22:35] <zohoor> thank you 
[18:22:39] <digitok> great, yw
[18:23:00] <digitok> 07re101-cuscus-24, if you don't need to allow " or ' after -- or #, i can do it with import re
[18:23:52] <digitok> but i doubt that's the case
[18:24:15] <re101-cuscus-24> I was thinking about "look ahead", but it seems complicated
[18:24:42] <digitok> yea it needs a bit more than that unless the answer to my previous question is yes
[18:24:56] <digitok> meaning it won't match if the comment contains a quote
[18:25:37] <re101-cuscus-24> installing regex is not a problem
[18:25:53] <digitok> ok cool
[18:25:59] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/rwoHSf/2
[18:26:22] <OnlineCop> Don't forget escaped quotes...
[18:26:47] <digitok> quiet you
[18:27:12] <OnlineCop> \"(?>[^\"\\]+|\\.)*\"
[18:27:27] <OnlineCop> s/^|$/`/gm
[18:27:44] <OnlineCop> `\"(?>[^\"\\]+|\\.)*\"`
[18:28:07] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/rwoHSf/3
[18:29:06] <OnlineCop> 'import regex' supports `(?>`
[18:29:19] <digitok> cool
[18:29:28] <OnlineCop> Actually... I don't know what the difference would be...
[18:29:30] <digitok> pcre does too, doesn't mean i'm gonna use it
[18:29:33] <digitok> :)
[18:29:41] <OnlineCop> `(?:...)*+` vs `(?>...)*`
[18:30:09] <digitok> the possessive quantifier prevents backtracking to before the group
[18:30:26] <digitok> the atomic group prevents backtracking inside the group
[18:31:20] <OnlineCop> Interesting. I'll have to test out a few test cases. I might have to change all my `(?>[^...]+|\\.)*` to `(?:[^...]+|\\.)*+` if that works better.
[18:36:53] <OnlineCop> I think Code Generator needs both a python `re` and a python `regex` version...
[18:38:49] <re101-cuscus-24> digitok can you include the multiline comments? Or is this only adding `|((/\*)+?[\w\W]+?(\*/)+)`?

[18:52:52] <zohoor> I am looking to get all the sizes in the text that have indicated by " (I mean inches). In some cases the size is shown by multiplication(18.00"X36.00") and in some cases it's a number like 27" . how can I get this pattern?
[18:54:36] <Butch> I am trying to write a custom syntax highlighter for something similar to BASIC, My old solution was awful and missed lots of function names.

[20:01:01] <zohoor> Please, help me to get the list of words
[20:01:02] <zohoor> https://regex101.com/r/hndgaw/1
[20:02:47] <JohnDoe2> zohoor are you trying to connect the sizes in inches with the product names? what's the end goal
[20:03:39] <zohoor> since I need different sorts of size to be added to the product name, maybe we can't make it here
[20:04:07] <zohoor> I think if I just split these words the combine them based on other conditions to get the size and name would be ok 
[20:06:23] <JohnDoe2> zohoor uhm ok... I think. Regex can do replacements too. But I can't say I understand what you want https://regex101.com/r/hndgaw/2
[20:07:41] <zohoor> This can't cover what I need
[20:07:59] <zohoor> I need to get the exact words
[20:08:18] <JohnDoe2> zohoor "get the exact words"  = match those words?
[20:08:23] <zohoor> can you make conditions as well?
[20:08:30] <JohnDoe2> when splitting you probably don't want to consume the words
[20:08:31] <zohoor> yes, math 
[20:08:51] <JohnDoe2> so if you match them they'll be gone from your split string - most likely
[20:08:56] <zohoor> sorry that was my mistake, I mean match 
[20:09:10] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/hndgaw/3
[20:09:23] <JohnDoe2> zohoor it's fine, just don't let it happen again 😛
[20:09:46] <JohnDoe2> what conditions are we talking about? Feel free to spill your guts, it's free
[20:11:33] <zohoor> I just asked, like if conditions. :)
