[02:34:05] <Sauvin> The term "calling shell" isn't relevant here.
[02:34:26] <dostoyevsky2> Is SHELL set by login?  Or do shells themselves set SHELL?
[02:34:34] <ayecee> dostoyevsky2: by login, yes
[02:34:45] <ayecee> shells don't (shouldn't?) set it.
[02:34:46] <Psi-Jack> Actually it is. Since the shell I was in at the time of executing the test.sh script was in fact, zsh. Which is technically my default shell, but also a subshell of tmux.

[02:37:18] <dostoyevsky2> You should at least tile three levels deep... N^3 is where it's at
[02:37:20] <Psi-Jack> Tilix spawns a /login/ shell, (zsh), which immediately executes `tmux attach` which tmux specifically is configured to run zsh itself specifically.
[02:37:30] <mrjpaxton[m]> For me, $SHELL is always set when running Bash. IDK what would cause it not to be set when running bash. When running sh/dash, it doesn't change the variable (no set/unset).
[02:37:32] <ayecee> twainwek: the line in your script is also echo $SHELL with nothing else around it?
[02:37:46] <Psi-Jack> So I could have /bin/bash as my default shell, and still have zsh regardless as my actual shell.

[02:51:28] <Psi-Jack> And I'd be looking for likely something like the AMD RX 5700 or better, for the AMD line if I went AMD
[02:51:39] <mrjpaxton[m]> Yeah, I'm not saying Nvidia has terrible technology at all. They have revolutionized graphics industry in a very notable way, I just have a hard time trusting them as a company that would support FOSS all the way.
[02:52:08] <mrjpaxton[m]> Because they haven't.

[02:53:21] <mrjpaxton[m]> I'm honestly more curious to see what Intel can do with their dedicated GPUs, and if they will get great FOSS/Linux support. That would be amazing if they can get performance close to on on part of that with AMD/Nvidia.
[02:53:29] <felco> I have a Kepler nv card, it is one of the most feature complete card supported by nouveau, but still require some firmwares from nvidia

[02:57:44] <Psi-Jack> Granted, current market for video cards..... Is completely fubar.
[02:57:44] <mrjpaxton[m]> Well... AMD is at a point where they are trying to get more competitive with Intel/Nvidia now, looks like. Dunno if the scalper problems have been getting any better with Nvidia GPUs as well. But um... I don't always need the latest and greatest. I can settle for oneor two gens behind. Lol.

[04:08:32] <blackgatonegro> You basically need a gamer PC.
[04:08:35] <mrjpaxton[m]> Emulators for the most part have been very CPU clock dependent. Sometimes multiple cores help more, but not multiple threads or "hyper-threading" as much.

[04:08:49] <circuitbone> ^

[04:08:57] <Alternity> there was a dreamcast version as well iirc
[04:09:19] <mrjpaxton[m]> Yea, I only bother doing "serious" emulaton with RetroArch on Linux gaming PCs. I use Ryzen and Radeon. They seem to get along pretty well.
[04:09:21] <circuitbone> I had wired my ps1's by that stage and was buring drink coasters
[04:09:36] <blackgatonegro> Ah yeah tried the leaked version on my dreamcast, worked fine but I have a working PS1...
[04:09:56] <bluebeargreen> dostoyevsky2: Ya but if RPCS3 runs around 75 - 90 percent of my CPU on my normal PC, I dont think a RPI can run a ps3 emulator

[04:40:23] <mrjpaxton[m]> It might help to know what game it is, if you're willing to provide that info. Some games on wine run better or worse than others. Sometimes regressions in the code happen when Wine is getting updated that cause games to no longer run that once did run.
[04:40:39] <CoolerX> dostoyevsky2, hmm how do I get it?
[04:40:42] <blackgatonegro> PlayOnLinux the Proton for the "not gonna buy that game again" crowd.
[04:40:52] <dostoyevsky2> CoolerX: pacman -S proton
[04:41:03] <mrjpaxton[m]> But yeah, people say PlayOnLinux, but the project has really gotten bad lately. I think they've made a new version of POL that is really bad compared to the original. How do people use Proton standalone? I also don't know that.
[04:41:40] <blackgatonegro> mrjpaxton[m] thats why playonlinux is great it lets you runn different versions of wine.

[04:48:17] <mrjpaxton[m]> It's hard to get lag-free game playback on Linux without something like a Steam Link. I have tried. I have also tried with RDP, which supports sound, unlike other remote desktop protocols like VNC. It's really best to play games locally, otherwise you're just gonna get uncomfortable input lag no matter what.

[04:50:15] <CoolerX> dostoyevsky2, yes firefox works
[04:50:18] <Psi-Jack> At least X2Go uses ssh tunneling and NX to automate the process, including persistent sessions as needed, to not only load a single app but can do an existing running desktop, or a new isolated desktop session.
[04:50:20] <blackgatonegro> Looks like another reason to stay in mint 19.3

[06:22:14] <Guest5496> Ubuntu is bleeding edge
[06:22:22] <Psi-Jack> HaMsTeRs: Fijitsu what?
[06:22:30] <CoolerX> ok so I have to close this vm and start another vm with Fedora?
[06:22:44] <ayecee> HaMsTeRs: fujitsu has a very wide range of products and it's impossible to characterize their support by only that.
[06:22:49] <Psi-Jack> CoolerX: It might be easier than starting with Ubuntu, since it likely already has what you're looking for.
[06:23:13] <ayecee> Psi-Jack: well but not recent byacc apparently
[06:23:20] <Psi-Jack> byacc-2.0.20210109 is in Fedora 34.
[06:23:41] <ayecee> oh, i misunderstood.
[06:23:43] <Psi-Jack> mesa 8.0.0, which definitely supports glx 1.4
[06:24:01] <Psi-Jack> And that's just OOTB! 🙂
[06:24:27] <Psi-Jack> And since it's a VM... Why the heck not make life easier? 😉
[06:24:28] <CoolerX> and I have to follow all those steps again to install x2go and xfce
[06:24:50] <CoolerX> Psi-Jack, by vm I mean a vpc on Digital Ocean
[06:24:51] <Psi-Jack> Well, you could get Fedora 34 XFCE spin.
[06:24:53] <CoolerX> vps
[06:25:06] <Psi-Jack> Oh.. Okay. Seems excessive, but sure.

[06:25:31] <Psi-Jack> I mean, MOST likely, yeah, that might be needed for a game!
[06:25:39] <Psi-Jack> A game that requires GLX 1.4 no less....
[06:25:44] <CoolerX> those are expensive tho
[06:25:54] <Psi-Jack> or you could save your money and try to run it in your own computer first.

[06:26:27] <CoolerX> what if I compile byacc from source?
[06:26:45] <Psi-Jack> CoolerX: I mean, you could, but you would have to pull it from source and rcs.
[06:26:51] <Psi-Jack> Specifically.
[06:26:55] <sheep> why byacc rather than bison?
[06:27:11] <Psi-Jack> sheep: mesa apparently uses byacc?
[06:27:13] <markasoftware> Compiling from source is generally the most reliable way to get the latest version of anything
[06:27:29] <Psi-Jack> markasoftware: And usually the last resort, generally. heh
[06:27:34] <sheep> weird

[11:13:35] <b0nn> that might work

[11:14:09] <esselfe> I'd say LFS (LinuxFromScratch) would be a good example build system
[11:14:30] <b0nn> heh
[11:14:39] <b0nn> it'd be faster to install a VM I think
[11:14:50] <wigums> yea a vm or a chroot

[15:31:58] <pasiz> every novnc instance is client
[15:32:07] <varaindemian> what about the ports? should I open x11vnc servers on different ports and then provide those ports to the noVNC?

[15:50:19] <inky> i am trying to read from ambient light sensor sysfs files

[15:50:37] <inky> older devices (i have this impression) have

[15:51:26] <inky> well i can only check on two devices now. and this in_illuminance_raw shows much much bigger values than in_illuminance_input on the other device.
[15:51:49] <inky> there is also in_illuminance_scale file, and it is available on both devices.
[15:52:03] <inky> on one it contains 2000, on other 0.100000

[16:32:10] <varaindemian> instead of x11?
[16:33:03] <Psi-Jack> x2go is a persistent capable, secure by design (it initiates an ssh tunnel), multi-platform client (Linux, macOS, Windows), able to provide access to a desktop already running, a new desktop, or a single application.

[16:38:42] <Psi-Jack> You can have the x2goserver on the server side, which is mostly what helps keep sessions persistent.
[16:38:53] <Psi-Jack> There is a client, you can install/run on each client point.
[16:39:18] <Psi-Jack> It's in most distros to have both., and they have a download site for windows and macOS for the rest. 🙂

[23:36:22] <qman> I've done it with USB flash drives and it does work, the main issue is USB bandwidth, being a laptop it won't have many ports
[23:36:39] <deniska> recyclehero: of course there were plenty of what we called "winmodems" which were audio cards with a telephone jack instead of an audio port, which relied on software encoding, which was typically only available as a windows driver, hence the nickname
[23:37:07] <qman> I used process substitutions with tee to write them all using one read of the image
[23:37:39] <PaulFertser> recyclehero: a setup to consider would be to get your downlink from a sat so that the slow dial up would work only as an uplink.
[23:37:46] <qman> I did about 6 or 7 at once on a desktop, just using all the available ports
[23:37:47] <recyclehero> aha so I should look for a serial dialup modem

[23:43:20] <deniska> puff: well, a usb controller has a (theoretical and practical) limit, and pi emmc has a writing speed limit, a simple math problem to solve :)
[23:43:44] <qman> recyclehero: many winmodems never actually got Linux drivers, similar to windows only USB printers, where the device was dumb and all the work was done in software
[23:43:55] <qman> So you need a supported modem
[23:44:00] <puff> I have a thinkpad t580 with 2 USB-A ports.

[23:44:25] <akik> PaulFertser: they actually are doing just that
[23:44:26] <qman> Best bet are external ones that connect over serial port, since there's no actual specific driver then

[23:45:43] <akik> PaulFertser: but the news i read was not clear if they had disconnected all internet connections as that would show directly. they are planning it though
[23:45:54] <Psi-Jack> greatcoof: No, you responded to something else moments later.
[23:45:55] <qman> puff: the number you can do at once efficiently depends on USB bandwidth vs sd card write speed
[23:45:57] <greatcoof> can you paste them or pastebin them?
[23:46:07] <puff> Psi-Jack: Also usb-c ports.  The PI IO board "slave USB" is a micro-B jack.  The board also has four USB A jacks so I guess I could connect it via tht but I don't know if the flashing will work over that.

[23:46:43] <deniska> PaulFertser: it will make too many people too angry at once, so that's indeed too hypothetical at this point
[23:46:45] <beltwaybob> deniska: it will depend on the country, but I think you tend to have better protection for a telephone line than for an internet connection at any level.  Also, tapping a single telephone line is going to take more resources than tapping everything that goes through a NOC, etc.

[23:48:29] <beltwaybob> deniska: if you just want to talk to your friends somewhere else, that is very hard to stop. If you want to access mass content, that is fairly easy for them to stop, domestically.
[23:48:44] <qman> In most of the world, telephone had gone VoIP anyway and it's all internet traffic now

[23:53:05] <deniska> if you block int'l services tomorrow in Russia, a lot of angry people who were cut off work and entertainment will go to streets, and gov't hates people going outside for whatever reason

[23:53:51] <beltwaybob> If you did your own dialup ISP, you could encrypt it, e.g. you'd have your ppp link or whatever and that would be encrypted
[23:54:01] <deniska> if you want to implement the great firewall in Russia, you first have to spend 10 years building what amounts to chinese WeChat and friends
[23:54:02] <b33r> russia honestly isn't a bad country when it comes to censorship, certainly no worse than the US
[23:54:32] <beltwaybob> deniska: ya, this is what I mean, they can censor the major platforms---for all the talk of internet censorship, there is no capacity to censor IRC, so why aren't all of the ppl who hate censorship runnin gtheir own IRC servers on $5 VPNs?
[23:54:36] <beltwaybob> err, VPSs

[23:57:02] <madprops> wondering if there's a way to get the full path of a dir made with mkdir
[23:57:09] <beltwaybob> The goal is to project the myth of governmental omnipotence, not to reveal that 'well, we have censorship of the 5 largest websites uesd by 95% of people'
[23:57:11] <djph> madprops: what?
[23:57:21] <deniska> technically you can just cut all cables leading to outside world and triangulate all smart-a*ses with satellites antennas :)
[23:57:26] <c705> this seems incredibly off topic
[23:57:34] <beltwaybob> You can just kill people and then they stop talking, deniska :P

[23:58:01] <beltwaybob> ya, that is the other issue, but that is less of a probelm in asia because they developed bureaucracy earliest on so most of the population is accustomed to bureaucracy
[23:58:07] <deniska> you can only make small groups of people angry at the same time
