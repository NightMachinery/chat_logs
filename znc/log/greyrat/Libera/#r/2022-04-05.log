[22:05:16] <dgg> Hi there
[22:14:20] <dgg> I need to collect data from some fish transitions between stations along. For each graph I want to get some metrics that I will collect via igraph
[22:14:58] <dgg> Traditionally in Python I would create a class with attributes of different data types and methods to get such details in different format
[22:15:15] <dgg> how would you achieve that in R, please?
[22:15:33] <fendur> dgg: igraph's data structure has room for attributes
[22:16:06] <fendur> dgg: but im probably not understanding what you're asking
[22:16:28] <dgg> fendur, yeah. I guess you can create edge-level attributes and node-level attributes somehow. However what I want is more a sort of status summary at graph level
[22:17:27] <dgg> For example, for lubina x I will get what is the centrality, betweenness, start date and end date, etc... of a particular graph between x and y dates
[22:17:59] <dgg> I want a sort of report per individual per month about the characteristics of each observed graph
[22:18:36] <fendur> dgg: easy to build the structure as a hierarchical list() in R and the graph level metrics can just go along side the graph itself. Then you can give that list a class--or the sub-components a class--that get operated on by print/plot/whatever functions
[22:19:33] <fendur> but not sure if you just need to understand the class system or if you're maybe looking for the right canned solution for this problem (which I don't know)
[22:21:25] <dgg> My mind thinks in Python terms. Class Lubina that will have attributes which hold the data context of that lubina: Array of months and associated graphs and graph-level metrics plus some overall details that are siblings of this array
[22:21:30] <dgg> in short
[22:22:10] <dgg> what is the best way to create a list of complex objects that will have as attributes another list of objects and other single datatype object attributes
[22:22:14] <dgg> ?
[22:22:58] <dgg> I can then create a report class that would read through the list of individual and would generate a pdf report summarising the most relevant metrics of each graph
[22:23:00] <fendur> you simply use list( list( list( ... )))
[22:23:31] <dgg> oh god, really? I would have thought that R had more sophisticated data structures
[22:23:33] <fendur> or things like lapply return lists, and can do a lot of the hierarchy work for you
[22:23:46] <dgg> ok
[22:24:03] <fendur> R has a few ways of doing this stuff. I only know what's called S3
[22:24:24] <fendur> There are others that are much more sophisticated. But I'm a get-shit-done type of person, so I haven't gone there.
[22:24:33] <fendur> to be frank
[22:25:13] <fendur> https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html
[22:28:20] <dgg> fendur, thanks a lot. My problem is I don't know whether I am overdoing it or not. To me, it is pretty simple to think about classes. My world works much easier that way but is that the right mentality when it comes to R?
[22:30:30] <fendur> yes. I just think there's a variety of ways to go about it and i do the simplest, which is just nested lists, constructed in whatever way suits the problem
[22:35:11] <dgg> fendur, sure.  My problem is that for me nested lists bring bad memories about the List programming language. It is not natural for me to think this way and sound scary to me. But hey, it is my mindset unfortunately
[22:36:01] <fendur> dgg: :) why not use python?
[22:36:38] <dgg> fendur, because the department I work for people have no clue about Python. However I should have been more pushy to be honest

[23:01:56] <confuseus> terrible that you get to work with people who know neither R nor python. but that means you have secure employment...due to the skills you possess.
[23:04:14] <dgg> confuseus, have you ever worked with R6 in R?
[23:16:32] <confuseus> nope. mostly lists
[23:20:48] <confuseus> i am not developing software. just solving some research problems using statistics. so i spend lots of times in data.frames, lists, etc. the last time i thought about oop was eons ago during a java class.
