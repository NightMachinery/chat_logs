[00:06:50] <feepbot> <gwern> 'As I have written about elsewhere, consider the case of Thomas Bracket Reed, Speaker of the House, and his opinion about annexing Hawaii in 1898. Reed opposed it. In 2017, Stephen Kinzer wrote that Reed “told a friend that the United States might as well ‘annex the moon.’” But actually, Reed never said this. How did Kinzer make this error? The lens of
[00:06:50] <feepbot> “telephone” helps us understand why. Kinzer’s error clearly was not intentional. He cites a 2011 book by James Grant. Grant, meanwhile, cites another book, from 1931, by Walter Millis. And Millis cites a 1914 biography, by Samuel McCall, and that is where it ends. McCall did not quote Reed. Instead, he speculated that Reed probably felt it was no more necessary to annex
[00:06:50] <feepbot> Hawaii than it was to annex the moon. Millis quotes McCall but does not cite McCall, leading Grant (after reading Millis, but not McCall) to believe that Reed actually said those words. Kinzer took it one step further by imagining that Reed told his friend he felt this way. In a century, therefore, McCall’s opinion became Reed’s words.'

[01:26:02] <feepbot> Quirrell was defeated and imprisoned indefinitely until such time as he might be safely healed.

[03:02:53] <kuudes> I wonder, does might makes right make sense?
[03:03:04] <kuudes> moral is about preferences
[03:03:20] <Betawolf> you'd prefer to be mighty, surely
[03:03:31] <kuudes> yes
[03:03:44] <kuudes> but it seems to me the mighty still seem to have also other preferences than might
[03:04:21] <PlanckWalk> Might is an instrumental goal
[03:04:49] <kuudes> yes, but the point of statement "might makes right" is to say there are no other aims that are true
[03:05:17] <PlanckWalk> There can be other things that are right, but anything done by the mighty is also right.
[03:05:17] <saturn2> the point is that the mighty get to realize their preferences and the non-mighty don't
[03:05:29] <Betawolf> what saturn2 said
[03:05:42] <kuudes> indeed. but the saying "there is only might makes right and not international law" for instance seems to be a thing
[03:05:58] <kuudes> and it seems to me that may not necessarily be aligned with reality
[03:06:08] <kuudes> because the mighty seem to prefer "international law"
[03:06:20] <PlanckWalk> Some of them do, for now, in a limited sense
[03:06:26] <Betawolf> the mighty prefer to refer to what they do as being in line with "international law"
[03:06:37] <Betawolf> even if this is facially absurd
[03:06:45] <PlanckWalk> (Of course, since they largely *make* international law, this is not surprising)
[03:06:49] <kuudes> Betawolf, not only that
[03:06:57] <kuudes> they seem to have self ambitions
[03:07:24] <kuudes> ie they seem to portray that indeed sometimes they are not within their aim of international law
[03:07:42] <kuudes> if it wasn't so, it would seem to me the world should be rather different
[03:08:19] <kuudes> us president does not have daily rape service or daily drug service or whatnot
[03:08:25] <kuudes> even though they are the mightiest
[03:08:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I don't know how to do that because I don't understand how Scott can think he has integrated those points, when he clearly hasn't :\
[03:08:37] <PlanckWalk> Where "international law" aligns with their interests, they talk about international law.
[03:08:43] <kuudes> there seem to be other things in play rather than just pure might makes right.
[03:08:50] <PlanckWalk> Where it doesn't, they don't even mention it.
[03:09:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I mean... he says himself stuff like "a stronger country like the US would get away with it" ... and then... forgets about that? Doesn't follow it at all? Something?
[03:09:11] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, that is not the point
[03:09:26] <kuudes> my point is that "there is only might makes right and not international law" seems to be untrue
[03:09:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Like, he seems to just be saying obviously false things, then admitting that they're false, then carrying on as if he didn't just admit they're false

[03:09:54] <kuudes> if it was true, it would be enough to state "there is only might makes right" but indeed staters want to also state the latter part
[03:09:57] *** voltage is now known as voltage_
[03:10:05] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: What do you think is meant by the part "and not international law"?
[03:10:31] <PlanckWalk> As I see it, it just means "international law exists, but is effectively irrelevant"
[03:10:39] <kuudes> it seems to aim to show there are no true ambitions to rule based order
[03:10:49] <Betawolf> as often the case with rules, it's good for other people to follow them
[03:11:09] <kuudes> sure. but us president does not have a daily rape service
[03:11:19] <PlanckWalk> Hmm.  I should say "effectively irrelevant in determining what the mighty do"
[03:11:25] <Betawolf> right, but that's likely because he like most people does not enjoy rape
[03:11:32] <PlanckWalk> It's certainly relevant in determining what the non-mighty do.
[03:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, the "rape service" thing seems like a silly example that comes out of nowhere
[03:12:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's also not relevant; who cares about the President?
[03:12:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> We're talking about international relations, not personal power within a society
[03:13:18] <PlanckWalk> (Also there are apparently quite a few powerful individuals who hire young girls to rape)
[03:13:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Yeah uh also did you forget about the whole Epstein thing
[03:13:54] <saturn2> nations are imaginary
[03:14:03] <kuudes> in the epstein thing there was still the hiding
[03:14:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok?
[03:14:10] <Betawolf> If you want to ask if the President of the United States could find someone to get him a girl to have sex with if he wanted to, I'm pretty sure he could
[03:14:14] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: my recommendation: you don't argue against him. You tell everyone who likes him that he's full of shit, and that you shouldn't bother paying attention to someone who bullshits so faciley (sp)
[03:14:16] <kuudes> if you have might makes right, you can do naked use of power
[03:14:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: :\
[03:14:35] <kuudes> trump's "I could shoot a person on main street and get no repercussions" is near where I gesture toward
[03:14:44] <PlanckWalk> If you're the only mighty person, sure.
[03:14:45] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: you cannot trust a person like that to behave like a proper actor who feels shame
[03:14:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: But nobody's claiming that this applies to individuals within American society, much less the President
[03:15:11] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: related: https://sarahhaider.substack.com/p/they-will-never-be-convinced-that?s=r
[03:15:12] <PlanckWalk> That's a lot less true of individuals than of nations
[03:15:18] <Robomot> They will never be convinced that cancel culture exists (Let's not waste our breath)
[03:15:26] <kuudes> international law still deals with individuals
[03:15:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Yeah. I guess so. I was just wondering if saturn2 had some ideas of how to do the thing he said
[03:15:36] <PlanckWalk> Individuals have pretty strong upper bounds on their individual power.
[03:15:48] <PlanckWalk> Nations don't really.
[03:15:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Eh, let's not go that far

After some false starts, I settled on an approach where the disk image is broken up into fixed-size content-addressed 256K chunks. Filesystem requests from Emscripten are intercepted, and when they involve a
[04:44:20] <feepbot> chunk that has not been loaded yet, they are sent off to a service worker who will load the chunk over the network. Manually chunking (as opposed to HTTP range requests) allows each chunk to be Brotli-compressed (ranges technically support compression too, but it’s lacking in the real world). Using content addressing makes the large number of identical chunks from the empty
[04:44:20] <feepbot> portion of the disk map to the same URL. There is also basic prefetching support, so that sequential reads are less likely to be blocked on the network. Along with some old fashioned web optimizations, this makes the emulator show the Mac’s boot screen in a second, and be fully booted in 3 seconds, even with a cold HTTP cache.' <-- oh, I wondered how it could download so fast

[06:07:00] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Low-alcohol beer starts out as regular alcoholic beer, which is then processed to remove the alcohol. Older processes simply heat the beer to evaporate most of the alcohol. Since alcohol is more volatile than water, as the beer is heated alcohol boils off first. The alcohol is allowed to escape and the remaining liquid becomes the product, essentially the opposite of the
[06:07:00] <feepbot> process used to make distilled beverages. Most modern breweries utilize vacuum evaporation to reduce the boiling temperature and maintain flavor. In essence, the beer is placed under a light vacuum to facilitate the alcohol molecules going into the gaseous phase. If a sufficient vacuum is applied, it is not necessary to "cook" the beer at a temperature that destroys the flavor.
[06:07:00] <feepbot> Some heat must nevertheless be supplied to counter the heat lost to enthalpy of vaporization. A more modern alternative process uses reverse osmosis to avoid heating the product at all. Under pressure, the beer is passed through a polymeric filter with pores small enough that only alcohol and water (and a few volatile acids) can pass through. A syrupy mixture of complex
[06:07:05] <feepbot> carbohydrates and most of the flavor compounds are retained by the filter. Alcohol is distilled out of the filtered alcohol-water mix using conventional distillation methods. Adding the water and remaining acids back into the syrup left behind on the filter completes the process.[42]' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-alcohol_beer huh
[06:07:06] <Robomot> Low-alcohol beer - Wikipedia (Low-alcohol beer is beer with little or no alcohol content and aims to reproduce the taste of beer while eliminating (or at least reducing) the inebriating effects of standard alcoholic brews. Most low-alcohol beers are lagers, but there are some low-alcohol ales. Low-alcohol beer is also known as light beer, non-alcoholic beer, small beer, small ale, or near-beer.)

[09:32:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: But you know, I don't think style consistency should be applied in such a minutely granular manner. It's aesthetically petty and mechanical.
[09:33:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: After all, gwern.net has plenty of non-rectilinear elements already! The directional navigation icons; various linkicons; drop caps; above all - the logo! Would you say all those Bezier curves in the G need to be straightened out?
[09:35:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The box around the curved arrow rectifies it quite sufficiently for stylistic consistency, in my considered opinion, so the appropriate metrics by which to judge said arrow are elegance and conformance to typographical environment (body text font, in this case). It gets high marks on both. I say that should the matter.

[09:54:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: As far as the selection visual artifacts, it seems to be a bug. I don't see any way to fix it in CSS, due to the way the ::selection pseudo-class works (it's very limited)... a JS fix may be possible, depending on how much performance we're willing to sacrifice (I think I can do it *relatively* efficiently but I expect that potato computers/phones may notice it... but maybe not?) ... which of course could spawn bugs of

[11:49:20] <rsaarelm> And in retrospect it seems like a good thing I missed that train and jumped into the C one a few years later, because C is still a going concern while 8-bit assembly is dead as doornail and all the special knowledge people built up for that is pretty much useless.

[11:50:39] <feep> well, not to write, no
[11:50:42] <rsaarelm> I guess being able to read compiler-generated assembly would be useful occasionally yeah.
[11:50:54] <feep> the payoff is stuff like, being able to look at disassembly in gdb and actually understand what you're looking at
[11:51:18] <quanticle> Assembly was valuable to me mostly because it was a means for me to learn how CPUs actually work, not because I've ever written any meaningful amount of assembly ever.

[11:51:33] <feep> primarily gps
[11:51:36] <rsaarelm> Funnily, I do know how to write some assembly now since I wrote a toy Forth at one point, but it's still hard to read it because I'd need to recognize all the opcodes and tricks the compiler is using.

[12:36:03] <dbohdan[phone]> Not getting your children a computer to experiment with pretty early seems a clear mistake, like Obormot\Arcturus points out in the thread. You should also not instill in them the fear of breaking one.
[12:36:44] <quanticle> My mom tried to instill that fear in me. It failed horribly. She said, much later, that that was when she gave up on me becoming a doctor.
[12:38:11] <dbohdan[phone]> I had a computer at five (an older PowerBook with a 4-bit gray screen). I didn't do a lot with it. My parents were afraid they or I would break it, and we had no access to Mac software. Eventually, I lost interest in it. I think it mostly helped me learn to click around and appreciate GUIs. 
[12:39:30] <quanticle> My first computer was a Pentium running Windows 3.11 for Workgroups.

[12:44:10] <dbohdan[phone]> Having a Windows 95 PC, not a very powerful one but one I was free to play with on my own, at nine or so proved crucial. There came a time when I stopped being afraid to break it and gradually learned about the file system layout, archivers to save space and extract games, command.com for mass renaming, batch files (I studied a really complex one that had come with a pirated version of Duke3D to activate, among other 
[12:44:10] <dbohdan[phone]> things, a "more/nude babes" mod). This contributed to my understanding of computers as much as learning to program in Borland Pascal.

[12:47:42] <quanticle> Oh yeah, everything I've read about Delphi says you made the right choice.
[12:49:23] <dbohdan[phone]> Borland favored it, too. And there was local knowledge in terms of a books, CD-ROMs with components, and a programming class.

It is a term that refers to the Son, Jesus Christ, as an additional …)
[14:05:33] <quanticle> "In the late 6th century, some Latin Churches added the words 'and from the Son' (Filioque) to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII of the Council of Ephesus, since the words were not included in the text by either the First Council of Nicaea or that of Constantinople. This was
[14:05:35] <quanticle> incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014, but was rejected by Eastern Christianity."
[14:05:37] <quanticle> They were wrong to do so, and the fact that the church of that era was too weak to prosecute this heresy does not make the addition any less heretical.
[14:06:32] <quanticle> Also, can you imagine any Jews doing something like this? Wilfully altering the sacred text of the Torah?

We would be accepted into the Union as the 51st State. Our boundaries would be the entirety of the Memphis Sands Aquifer which is spread across three states.
[14:09:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a lot of reasons I believe that this is important, but the primary is to prevent the exhaustion of the Memphis Sands Aquifer."

[14:10:54] <quanticle> I'm mostly triggered by the fact that they used "succession" when they meant "secession".
[14:13:00] <quanticle> That said, I'm not sure I agree with your characterization of this as "dumb normie shit". Normies, dumb or intelligent, most definitely don't care about water rights and aquifer policy, even when literal sand is coming out of their faucets.

[14:18:07] <quanticle> Ah, okay. Fair enough.
[14:18:15] <quanticle> "That’s a new way of thinking about water. For almost two centuries, with few exceptions, the U.S. legal system has protected water as 'res communes,' a public thing owned by no person or government body and subject to use by all under common law. It’s a special status given to few other things, like air, sunlight, and outer space."
[14:18:17] <quanticle> Maybe in the East, with its relatively rich rainfall and plentiful rivers. In the West, in places like Colorado, Arizona, California, etc. fights, both legal and physical, over who owns which water resources are as old as colonial settlement. The notion that the US legal system has "protected" water as "res communes" is, at best, only half true.

[23:22:19] <rmmh> ggreer: IRON ISN'T GREEN WAKE UP SHEEPLE 
[23:22:32] * adiabatic coughs
[23:22:48] <ggreer> if this was actually an issue, EVs would be insanely expensive
[23:22:51] <adiabatic> rmmh: isn't it teal?
[23:23:05] <rmmh> yeah no shit carbon-intensice processes pervade our supply chain 
[23:23:06] <ggreer> but it turns out that we can mine lots of stuff for cheap
[23:23:17] <rmmh> without carbon taxes etc it's the cheapest way
[23:23:20] <adiabatic> I remember teal iron and green iron.
[23:23:43] <pie_> just make sure your iron isnt red
[23:25:00] <pie_> [soviet anyhtem plays]
[23:25:19] <pie_> anthem even
[23:29:44] <rmmh> I am amused by electric cars claiming to be zero emission, ignoring the significant pm2.5 emissions from tires
[23:32:21] <two2thehead> that is actually a great point
[23:34:00] <ggreer> it's far less than gas cars. EVs use regen braking so the disc brakes are rarely engaged. that's a big source of particulates

[23:42:50] <dbohdan[phone]> Did anyone actually pronounce it "sexy" like Apple wanted?
[23:43:41] <adiabatic> my father probably did briefly, but not regularly
[23:43:44] <adiabatic> but he'd do that
[23:44:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan[phone]: Word on the street was that "scuzzy" was the East Coast pronunciation and "sexy" was the West Coast one
[23:44:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know if it's true but boy does it sound plausible
[23:45:08] <dTal> there's only one true pronunciation and that's ess see ess eye
[23:45:09] <adiabatic> oh, I've only heard "scuzzy"

[23:48:07] <Robomot> Noobs Need Rules | LessWrong (Cross-posted from Putanumonit. If you ask someone who’s good at dating for dating advice they’ll often tell you to “just be yourself”. Since they themselves are good at dating, being themselves serves them well. But if your self isn’t good at dating, you should probably be less yourself and more like the self of one of those people who are good at dating. Many such cases. …)

[23:58:37] <two2thehead> some of these are actually quite good 'Me: “How do I say I have a goddamn PhD do not patronize me?”'
