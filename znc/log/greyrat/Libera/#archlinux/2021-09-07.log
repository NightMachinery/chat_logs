[01:58:12] <feinedsquirrel> *doesn't provide any checksum, then deciding...*
[01:59:30] <Foucault> personally I feel that for integrity purposes even sha256 is sufficient, I'm positive there are not collision for sha256, let alone sha512
[01:59:40] <Foucault> not → no*
[02:00:25] <earnestly> b3sum is even faster still, and it has --no-names which is kind.  But they gain this speed by using fewer rounds
[02:00:44] <earnestly> (Calling it b3 is a bit of a cheek though)
[02:01:08] <Foucault> although, unless you're hashing loads of files the speed benefits are probably negligible
[02:01:34] <earnestly> The loads of files is indeed where the difference is /stark/
[02:02:14] <earnestly> b3sum's -l flag is also a bit more sensible

[02:21:43] <mpan> No, hash speed has nothing to do with collisions. Collisions are caused by too small output space (which is not the case in this situation). Or a poor hashing function IF the input is not random, which is also very unlikely in this case.

[02:26:13] <mpan> Indeed it would. But there is also no reason to use anything lower than SHA2 for integrity checks, considering that the speed of SHA2 is still fine and it has much larger output space.
[02:26:27] <mpan> (which doesn’t mean using anything lower is wrong)
[02:26:32] <hugo> Except that the usual argument that if the binary replaced the checksum will also be is void, since PKGBUILD's provides their own checksums
[02:27:01] <niki> hugo: https://shattered.it is probably what you heard mumbling about

[02:27:38] <mpan> Checksums arrays are for detecting that the file has been downloaded properly and isn’t damaged in transport from random effects. Not from malicious modification.

[02:30:04] <feinedsquirrel> Hm, I see. Thanks for confirming.
[02:30:09] <mpan> But you shouldn’s assume that this means SHA1 can’t be used at any use. In fact it can even be still used in cryptographic use: for example HMAC-SHA1 is still perfectly fine. While there is no reason to use it, HMAC based on MD5 would probably be fine.
[02:30:15] <tleydxdy[m]> the main argument I see to change hash for integrity is so libraries don't need to maintain/carry them and risk someone misusing them.
[02:30:47] <hugo> mpan: I believe that we agree on the usage of checksums in PKGBUILD-files. You are completely correct that their primary function isn't (mallicious) tamper validation, since the chain of trust of really poor
[02:31:09] <mpan> But PKGBUILD checksums is literally to detect that the file was not damaged during download or replaced in a non-malicious manner (e.g. receiving a 404 error page instead of source code or patch).

[02:54:05] <feinedsquirrel> but yeah, your explanation was more direct and clear
[02:54:12] <Namarrgon> well, yes but even if helpers were supported they would need to download the entire AUR metadata to find out which packages are potentially replacing another package
[02:55:27] <Namarrgon> if X replaces Y then Y is not aware of it, and you probably don't have X installed, so how would you or the helper learn about this?

[19:05:58] <rtur> Hi guys. I'm using pipewire-pulse and am having a problem with my bluetoothheadset from time to time. Whenever I skip around (or pause/play) in a video (e.g. in a browser) there is a small but non-zero chance that my headset disconnects immediatly. In dmesg I can see that pipewire-media segfaulted with error 6 in libspa-audiomixer.so. Has anyone experienced such a behaviour or is my system
[19:06:01] <rtur> messed up in non-standard ways?

[22:47:46] <mingdao> The CPU is a Ryzen 7 3700X, but it's box states "discrete graphics card required", so I assume I can't use the onboard graphics.
[22:48:00] <thurstylark> put it this way: does the yellowing follow the DVI, or does it follow the position?
[22:48:30] <Tom^> if so its the DVI / HDMI choosing different color space, YCbCr , RGB or what its called.
