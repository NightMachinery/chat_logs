[00:13:30] *** Quits: tech_exorcist_ (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479) (Quit: see you tomorrow)
[00:49:44] <bookworm> Android 12... this is gonna be fun
[00:49:57] <bookworm> what did they break this time
[00:54:26] <Activ8> Hopefully everything lol
[00:56:12] <bookworm> hopefully not...
[00:56:29] <bookworm> but so far they managed that pretty much every single time
[00:56:47] <bookworm> beta testing on the pixel users I guess
[00:59:39] <Activ8> Break things on purpose 
[00:59:51] * Snuupy pixel
[00:59:54] * Snuupy stays on android 11 for now
[01:00:18] <Activ8> I wish companies would just stop breaking things it can’t be that hard to ship something not broken
[01:00:41] <Activ8> Microsoft done the same with windows 11
[01:01:04] <Activ8> Apple with iOS revisions and android as well 
[01:01:28] <bookworm> google isn't fixing the thing they should, aka the ad id and tracking and shit because they don't want to
[01:02:27] <bookworm> rather they give you some half baked "feature" that disables apps ability to read all the storage
[01:02:28] <Activ8> Disappointing that would really put me off buying it
[01:02:36] <bookworm> apple is worse
[01:02:45] <Snuupy> just stay on 1 release back
[01:02:51] <Snuupy> no reason not to use google products
[01:02:55] <Snuupy> I quite like them actually
[01:03:03] <Snuupy> let the beta testers work out the kinks though
[01:03:06] <bookworm> installs a scan all your files thing with  a government issued kist, yeah. Hard no
[01:03:15] <Snuupy> LOL yeah fuck that
[01:03:20] <Snuupy> it's like the people updating to windows11 on day0
[01:03:24] <Snuupy> what the fuck did you think was going to happen
[01:03:37] <Activ8> For the foreseeable future I’ll be 1 revision behind unless I’m testing then I run side by side 
[01:03:38] <bookworm> hey, I like new toys mkey?
[01:03:47] <Activ8> i was on 11, gone back to 10
[01:03:53] <bookworm> also, security updates
[01:04:02] <bookworm> you need and want them
[01:04:20] <Activ8> What’s point in that if things get brokeb
[01:04:21] <bookworm> and Android doesn't allow partial updates on pixels
[01:04:23] <Activ8> broken
[01:04:58] <Activ8> All companies NEED to separate features with security 
[01:05:01] <bookworm> well, some of  the broken things are seen as features... you'll only delay the issue not mitigate it
[01:05:11] <Activ8> they pissing me off big time when things break 
[01:05:37] <Activ8> patches that are security patches
[01:05:57] <Activ8> and feature updates that are explained to you what the update contains word for word exactly
[01:06:00] <Activ8> not rocket science
[01:06:37] <bookworm> hm, to quote GKH amd Linus, all bugs are security bugs
[01:06:42] <bookworm> and*
[01:06:54] <bookworm> and they are often right
[01:07:34] <bookworm> (least on the kernel /os level)
[01:07:42] <Activ8> Then in that analogy security updates  as a priority roll out
[01:07:55] <bookworm> they moved the effing special chars around on the keyboard, dammit
[01:07:56] <Activ8> features should be set in stone per release 
[01:08:20] <Activ8> will that effect the lounge in any way?
[01:08:27] <Activ8> is anything broken
[01:08:46] <bookworm> yes, I can't trivially type a forward slash
[01:09:13] <Activ8> Oh jees 
[01:09:19] <Activ8> maybe stay on 11
[01:09:19] <bookworm> they nutbugs put a backwards slash there though
[01:09:41] <bookworm> what were they smoking, in which situation do zou ever need a backslash?
[01:10:29] <Activ8> When you need the opposite of a forward slash I guess
[01:13:58] <bookworm> EVER TYPED A URL IN YOUR LIFE?
[01:14:12] <bookworm> guess which way it's pointed?
[01:16:13] <Activ8> I know I guess the devs where high 
[01:18:11] <Snuupy> lmao
[01:25:12] <Snuupy> I really should update my pixel 4a to the last revision of android 11
[01:25:22] <Snuupy> I hear a +10% GPU perf bump is in there somewhere
[01:25:30] <Snuupy> but then I'd have to uninstall all my magisk modules
[01:25:33] <Snuupy> then reinstall all my magisk modules
[01:25:37] * Snuupy sigh
[01:30:21] <Activ8> Silly devs
