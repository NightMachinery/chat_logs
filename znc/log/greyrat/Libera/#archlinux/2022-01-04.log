[05:39:19] <th0rne> Ok, but the idea is to save space and the files are videos, that the camera helpfully splits into fat friendly segments.
[05:39:48] <th0rne> If a tar them, will mpv still understand it?

[05:41:24] <th0rne> You're right, but I think now I've explained it sufficiently?
[05:41:40] <tirnanog> are you really wasting that much space on account of not aligning perfectly to the FAT cluster size? I would have thought that it is negligble with respect to the content itself.

[05:43:34] <th0rne> Like, on my computer, I'd rather have one video be one file, but if I want to put them back on the card to give to my mom or whatever, I need to resplit them again.
[05:44:09] <tirnanog> ok. in any case, concatenating files of a given (and so, far, unspecified) format together does not generally produce something that can still be readily parsed, though there are some exceptions.

[06:25:02] <th0rne> I haven't tried the xrandr dummy monitor stuff, but maybe that can help you.
[06:25:22] <th0rne> You put the workspace 2 on the dummy monitor when you aren't using it and then screenshot that.
[06:25:34] <th0rne> Maybe. I'm not sure if that's how it works.

[06:30:30] <th0rne> I imagine that what you're asking kind of doesn't make sense, since wms probably don't draw all the invisible workspaces all the time - that would be a huge waste of resources - so there's no way to screenshot them by default.
[06:33:10] <th0rne> Depending on your use case, maybe you could write a script that switches your workspace, takes a screenshot, and then switches back.

[08:09:35] <fury_> I've installed archlinux with proot or whatever on my device. not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. I'm a BSD guy, not really a linux guy. I've added a user (`useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash <myusername>`). I've used `visudo` to edit /etc/sudoers such that users in group 'wheel' can use sudo. but my user <myusername> cannot use sudo. am I missing something?

[08:10:17] <fury_> er, by "my device", I mean in termux. but for all intents and purposes, this is archlinux running on a device

[08:15:32] <tirnanog> fury_: actually, having looked at what proot does, I wonder whether it's even supposed to work.
[08:15:41] <fury_> it certainly is
[08:16:20] <tirnanog> no, there's nothing you need to do.
[08:16:41] <fury_> sudo -l reports: User root may run the following commands on localhost:\n    (ALL) ALL

[08:18:04] <phrik> Title: Sudo - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[08:20:35] <tirnanog> fury_: does "id -a" actually show that you're in the wheel group?
[08:23:35] <fury_> it's.. complicated. `group` has a bunch of group numbers (but not names). /etc/group has a wheel group with my name in it. `id -a` doesn't show me as either the 'wheel' group, or the numbered group (1002 according to /etc/group). this despite `useradd -m -G wheel ...` and repeated invokations of whatever the command to add a user to a group is (I can't find it in my buffer)

[08:24:27] <tirnanog> the normal solution is: log out and log in.
[08:24:33] <fury_> yeah I've done that
[08:24:46] <fury_> `bash -l` will pretty much do that
[08:24:50] <tirnanog> it does not.
[08:24:58] <fury_> and I've also done "however the heck it works"
[08:25:09] <fury_> ok, su -l <username> will
[08:25:19] <tirnanog> yes, su should.
[08:25:44] <fury_> and `id -a` still does not report that I'm in the correct group
[08:25:57] <fury_> and more alarmingly, `group` reports all numbered groups with the exception of my own usergroup and root

I have my home directory on a separate drive, and I have no real problem blowing up as much of my root directory
[08:43:26] <pamdemonia> and so forth as I need to, but are there any bits and pieces that I should save (in /usr or /etc or /vat or wherever else) instead of just wiping the partition clean and starting fresh?
[08:43:28] <pamdemonia> thanks

[08:54:00] <tirnanog> pamdemonia: it really depends on how you use you operating system. taking /var as an example, it's possible for /var/lib to be important to some people (/var/lib/mysql, /var/lib/samba, /var/lib/transmission ... that sort of thing).
[08:54:46] <tirnanog> but for applications that are used interactively, it tends to all be in your home directory.

[10:02:42] <jack> I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but.. Ive been running into a bit of an issue ever since I started using Arch and even Gentoo... Everything has a bit of a delay. At first I thought it was because I have an Nvidia 2060 Super but now I really dont know. Everything from moving my cusor to when I hover over buttons in a browser has a but of a delay, I had learned to ignore it but recently 
[10:02:48] <jack> I had to install windows on another hard drive and I notices it was so much smoother. Now I know something is wrong and id like to finally fix it. I have an amd ryzen 2700x cpu, nvidia RTX 2060 Super GPU and 16 gigs on ram. :)
[10:03:50] <labrador> yeah thats not normal
[10:03:58] <jack> oh
[10:04:31] <jack> is there anyway to fix it
[10:06:05] <jack> it is extremely minor but noticeable

[10:27:00] <JTL> jack: I don't know how your system is setup so I can't comment from the software perspective, but what I'd try is maybe single user mode, see if that has delay when typing/using commands, then maybe a KMS tty after that, than maybe xorg with something like twm or something else *very simple* to remove compositor and/or DE issues

[13:12:47] <baltazar> hi! I'm experiencing a strange behavior on plasma. I usually have a terminal and a browser open, on different desktops. upon switching from the browser to the terminal, I sometimes find I have somehow pasted some text that I selected in the browser
[13:13:05] <baltazar> anyone else experiencing something similar?
[13:13:27] <mpan> In general: haven’t you pressed the middle mouse button?
[13:13:47] <baltazar> no, I believe the pasting happens while I'm looking at the browser
[13:14:51] <mpan> Selecting something is usually setting the primary selection. But that doesn’t explain how that is pasted: most apps use middle button for that. :/
[13:14:58] <baltazar> I use the middle mouse button regularly for pasting selection, but I can't imagine that pasting the text in a window on a different desktop
[13:15:36] <baltazar> and I only see this effect with the terminal (konsole), I never seem to paste accidentally to any other program

[14:18:35] <Gagis> does tty use fallback fonts if or when it fails to find a glyph?
[14:19:25] <demonicmaniac1> there are multiple ways to do this. one simple way is to check if it's a tty or pty
[14:19:57] <wyre> demonicmaniac1, but is there some envvar like TERM or something like that to check what kind of terminal is? 
[14:20:03] <demonicmaniac1> there's also is it a login shell or not, in general login shells only are vts and not xterms

[14:21:49] <demonicmaniac1> zsh also has if [[ -o login ]] or something i think to check if it's a login shell or not
[14:26:15] <wyre> anyway ... tty graphics aren't as good as kmscon 😞
[14:26:50] <wyre> I mean, I could do this workaround, but ... my point is that I'd like to have a proper render on ttys 🤔

[14:29:22] <Gagis> shouldnt it be possible to set up proper resolution tty with some good choise of font via kms?
[14:31:24] <demonicmaniac1> kms does not give you freetype or fontconfig or ttf or etcpp
[14:31:32] <wyre> demonicmaniac1, but I'm using xorg
[14:32:00] <demonicmaniac1> it IS possible but you'd be writing a full terminal client implementing all of fontconfig and freetype
[14:32:28] <demonicmaniac1> wyre: then you can launch an xterm fullscreen on a seperate Xserver as single client without wm

[16:59:50] <noctavian> Hi! I want to install arch with full disk encryption and bcache (1 SSD + 1 HDD), the wiki doesn't provide guidance for this combination. Are there any major disadvantages if I encrypt first and then setup bcache as opposed to setup bcache first and then encrypt?

[22:57:52] <MacGuyLinux> Hello everyone, I have been working on switching my macs over to linux. Yes I know I could just get a PC, but I use mac os for some things and I have them so why not. I have a 2019 macbook air that I can not get arch to boot on to install. The USB installer hangs every time trying to boot it. Is this just a incompatibility issue with macs or the newer gen one. Any suggestions? I also tried a different installer and manjaro. Same issue thinking 
[22:57:52] <MacGuyLinux> maybe it was the ISO I used.

[22:59:24] <beastDivision> MacGuyLinux: getting linux to work on intel macs can be done, the issue is with booting and the TPM, you'll need to google for a guide based on the exact model you have, and then adapt it for arch
[22:59:49] <MacGuyLinux> beastDivision: TPM?
