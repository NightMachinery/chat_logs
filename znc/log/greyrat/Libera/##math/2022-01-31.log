[03:19:01] <spynxic> Is there a name for the rate coin flip outcomes (or any recurring event) converge to float at a negligible distance from the expected 50/50 probability
[03:20:26] <spynxic> I ask because it seems relatively more likely to have 5 same coin flips in a row than 100
[03:21:34] <Nucleos> Law of large numbers ?
[03:21:51] <Nucleos> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers
[03:22:18] <spynxic> Another way to ask this would be, how much might consecutive coin flip outcomes diverge from the expected 50/50 results as the coin flips move forward
[03:23:34] <greenbagels> spynxic: consecutive coin flips will have the same probability distribution regardless of what flips have already occurred
[03:24:35] <Nucleos> you can read this too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_whether_a_coin_is_fair#Examples

[04:07:11] <PlanckWalk> I don't understand the question
[04:07:16] <johnkeats7> and that's how lotteries make money heh
[04:07:23] <spynxic> While the odds of losing are quite high the odds of losing consecutively for years must be lower

[04:07:43] <PlanckWalk> (Or at least, one of many gambler's fallacies)
[04:07:57] <PlanckWalk> Losing the lottery doesn't increase the chance that you'll win the next one.
[04:08:15] <PlanckWalk> Losing a billion lotteries in a row doesn't increase the chance that you'll win the next one.
[04:08:45] <spynxic> What if the odds of winning were 1 in a 1000
[04:08:49] <PlanckWalk> Still true.
[04:09:18] <PlanckWalk> In that case yes, it is very unlikely that you'll lose a billion times in a row, but *if* it happens, your chance of winning the next one is still 1 in 1000.
[04:09:30] <PlanckWalk> (and also if it doesn't happen)
[04:10:18] <isekaijin> spynxic: Assuming that you can keep gambling forever, or at least until you win, even then in most likelihood the amount won won't cover your earlier losses.

[05:24:18] <ski> Lisps just tend to have (arbitrary precision) integers (in addition to finite precision), rationals, and then floating-point approximations (of reals and complex numbers)
[05:24:30] <isekaijin> aod: Pretty much.
[05:25:13] <isekaijin> Maybe internally it works with binary rather than decimal (certainly the case for normal computers, but pocket calculators might work with decimals, although I don't know).

[05:37:26] <zeroc00l0> "Football team A exists" means that there is a taxable organization with the name of that football team and people who wear jersey's with the football team's name on them who run around on a field.
[05:37:57] <ski> sure

[05:38:34] <zeroc00l0> No it's not. There are physical tax returns. And physical jerseys.

(and even that's problematic, considering how with relativity, the notion of "simultaneous point in time, at different locations" is problematic)
[05:42:17] <zeroc00l0> Is there a football stadium that extends through time?
[05:42:39] <ski> yea, that's the same question
[05:43:01] <ski> it seems to be a useful way for us to use language, to claim that
[05:43:06] <zeroc00l0> So that a football stadium extends thru time is true for the same reason that a football team extends thru time?
[05:44:00] <ski> yea, at least to some part. probably there are some (relevant) differences, e.g. we don't tend to regard stadiums as agentic
[05:44:16] <zeroc00l0> And what is the relevant principle?

[10:03:33] <bildramer> at least one way (assign R,P,S in each line going clockwise). how many are there total, assuming you are generous about what counts as isomorphic? is it just one?

[10:42:07] <Decker> so this geometric algebra expresses a lot of things as reflections; rotations are 2 relections around intersecting line, translations are reflections across lines that intersect at infinity (parallel)   and then using the difference of the lines and the object relatively determine how far that translation is

[10:43:47] <Decker> ya not sure what like arcsin of a translation would be

[14:37:11] <cadmio> yes
[14:37:55] <Franciman> well
[14:38:01] <Franciman> can we argue like this?
[14:38:15] <Franciman> take {1, sqrt(5), sqrt(3)}
[14:38:19] <Franciman> ehm
[14:38:29] <Franciman> {1, sqrt(3)} as a Q(sqrt(5)) basis
[14:38:33] <Franciman> what field does it generate?
[14:38:55] <Franciman> it surely contains Q(sqrt(3) + sqrt(5))
[14:38:58] <Franciman> but vice versa
[14:39:08] <Franciman> no wait wait wait
[14:39:10] <cadmio> I would say Q(sqrt(3))
[14:39:32] <Franciman> cadmio: i don't understand why Q(sqrt(3) + sqrt(5)) is an extension of Q(sqrt(5))
[14:40:09] <riv> it's a bit confusing to write Q(sqrt(3) + sqrt(5)) when you are considering this 'over Q(sqrt(5))'
[14:40:22] <riv> I would think you should write Q(sqrt(5))(sqrt(3) + sqrt(5)) instead
[14:40:47] <riv> note that Q(sqrt(5))(sqrt(3) + sqrt(5)) = Q(sqrt(5))(sqrt(3))
[14:40:59] <riv> just like how Q(sqrt(2) + 1/7) = Q(sqrt(2))
[14:41:11] <Franciman> yes
[14:41:14] <Franciman> now i agree

[14:44:38] <Franciman> yes
[14:45:05] <Franciman> in my parlance, Q(sqrt(5) + sqrt(3)) is extension to Q(sqrt(5))
[14:45:21] <Franciman> if {sqrt(5)} u Q \in Q(sqrt(5) + sqrt(3))
[14:45:27] <int-e> 18(sqrt(3) + sqrt(5) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(5))^3 = 4sqrt(5)

[14:46:19] <Franciman> ok so, awesome
[14:46:26] <riv> but int-e has proved it nicely
[14:47:31] <cadmio> Q(sqrt(5)) has basis {1, sqrt(5)} using the same product theorem of yesterday the final field should contain all multiples

[14:47:41] <riv> generally Q(a+b) = Q(a,b) unless there is some coincidence
