[00:04:08] <morlog> about 40lbs each hand
[00:04:18] <Panther> Yep
[00:04:33] <Panther> Maybe a little more with the bucket.

[00:07:21] <morlog> the buckets act like they are on a gimbal if you carry them on a yoke
[00:07:27] <Panther> After a 1/2 mile ordeal, you only show up with like 4oz of water, cuz it all spilled out :)
[00:07:39] <morlog> you end up spilling less than if you carried by hand
[00:08:03] <morlog> walk slow
[00:08:37] <morlog> also, throwing a half full 20oz bottle in the bucket helps offset the splashing
[00:08:51] <Panther> That's the nice thing about pieces of iron.. nothing really bad can happen, unless it falls on your foot.

[04:43:37] <Panther> So, I would have a few a day, and give the rest away... then they doubled in price, so that stopped.
[04:44:53] <morf> well at least you won't get addicted to stupid cigarettes 
[04:45:17] <artao> now i'm like, "Shit! I'm also out of cig butts. Can I snort this cig butt powder?"
[04:45:22] <artao> LMAO what a dolt!
[04:45:25] <Panther> I can't.... I smoked them for a few years, and I never really liked it much... it was something to do hanging out.

[04:45:43] <Panther> I think 6 ot 7 is the most I ever smoked in a day.
[04:45:59] <artao> i've smoked two+ packs in a day
[04:46:07] <Panther> I also was inna cigar of the month club, and they sent be a box of cigars every month.
[04:46:18] <Panther> I could never smoke all of thise.
[04:46:22] <artao> yegads! cigars. those are somethin
[04:46:59] <Panther> I would rather smoke a cigar or a pipe.
[04:47:16] <artao> there was a couple cigar bars in Madison WI that got fucked over when Madison banned smoking indoors 100%
[04:47:22] <artao> wtf
[04:47:34] <artao> people who go to those don't give a shit about the smoke. they seek it
[04:47:39] <artao> asshats
[04:48:48] <morf> yeah it's ridiculous 
[04:49:12] <morf> or in some underground music club, where everybody is like on 2-3 different drugs, but no you can't have a cigarette inside 
[04:50:02] <morf> i know couple places where they ignore the ban at least
[04:50:26] <artao> or here, in my apartment, where i live. they want me to go outside at least 50 ft away from the apartment
[04:50:40] <Panther> If you ignore bans, you could get glined.
[04:50:52] <artao> it's -17C
[04:51:00] <artao> i.e. 1F
[04:51:22] <artao> they want me to go outside 3 or 4 times an hr to have a cig. in this weather.
[04:51:23] <artao> fuck off
[04:51:27] <Panther> The cows are giving soft serve from the udders.
[04:51:49] <artao> can't just sit and listen to what i've been working on and have a cig and consider it
[04:51:58] <TomatoSynth> thats brutal
[04:57:54] <artao> in fact, my lease actually forbids vaping indoors too
[04:57:56] <artao> wtaf
[04:58:02] <artao> i sign it, but ... no
[04:58:06] <artao> i'll take that to court
[04:58:19] <morf> are they checking your place?
[04:58:33] <morf> i'm vaping inside everywhere 
[04:58:38] <morf> nobody can smell it 
[04:58:40] <morf> so fuck that 
[04:58:52] <artao> there's annual inspections. supposed to be just for maintenance reasons, the Feds require it to keep getting money
[04:58:59] <artao> but they always give me shit about other stuff
[04:59:21] <artao> smoking indoors was fine the first three yrs i lived here too. everything i own smells like cig smoke
[04:59:47] <artao> but the stale clothes and cat pee smell sometimes overwhelms the cig smell
[05:00:23] <artao> yeahp. this is a pretty heavy movie
[05:01:10] <artao> i'll definitely need something with levity after this
[05:01:51] <morf> sounds delicious 
[05:02:45] <artao> this is the same people who give me shit for having my disc golf basket outside on my patio, remember

[21:42:57] <golrom> i remember trying out wayland on my raspi

[21:54:00] <DOMF> I haven't actually tried any pro-audio specific distros
[21:54:02] <louipc> i've had problems with generic when i tried. never tried pro-audio ones
[21:54:07] * DOMF is an arch user
[21:54:34] <louipc> linux audio systems are a fukin mess

[21:54:47] <DOMF> <louipc> linux audio systems are a fukin mess <--agreed
[21:55:13] <louipc> pipewire seems to make a little improvement tho so i'll be trying that
[21:56:50] <murthy> I am have the latest pipewire compiled from source and installed
[21:57:25] <murthy> It has some small issues I think
[21:57:37] <murthy> I disabled pulse audio
[21:59:26] <murthy> I want to try wireplumber but I don't have any use case
[22:00:14] <louipc> murthy: much better than pulse?
[22:01:16] <murthy> The reason I installed pipewire was it supported aptx and ldac nicely, other than that I haven't tested any
[22:01:32] <murthy> I know most people hate pulseaudio but I had no issues with it
[22:01:47] <murthy> for me plain alsa was a mess
[22:01:57] <murthy> pulseaudio took care of it nicely
[22:02:25] <murthy> But I know jack support in Linux is not that good
[22:03:03] <murthy> When pipewire is mature it will solve these media issues fully

[22:06:42] *** Joins: piercedwater (~pwater@user/piercedwater)
[22:06:48] <louipc> i tried jack a bit when i dabbled with proaudio linux
[22:07:31] <murthy> louipc: when alsa used directly it won't allow multiple streams. I had a hard time using browsers with alsa
[22:08:12] <murthy> pulseaudio made it a breeze, also auto switching sinks and stuff was very nice
[22:08:26] <louipc> murthy: alsa has a software mixer since forever
[22:08:35] <louipc> but before that it would depend on the soundcard
[22:08:41] <murthy> you mean alsamixer?
[22:09:01] <murthy> no you don't want to mess with alsa configs
[22:09:05] <louipc> dmix
[22:09:11] <louipc> no i dont mess with it
[22:09:18] <louipc> it just works now
[22:09:18] <murthy> unless you know what you are doing exactly
[22:09:26] <murthy> idk
[22:09:29] <louipc> i guess depends on distro
[22:09:57] <louipc> but sure i guess that may be one reason to want pulse :p
[22:09:59] <murthy> louipc: alsa is like the xorg's xserver got to go
[22:10:15] <murthy> we need an integrated media server
[22:10:38] <louipc> but i guess pulse mixing is more sophisticated than alsas
[22:10:46] <louipc> and it has blutooth support
[22:11:08] <louipc> but it was fuked. so good thing pipewire came along
[22:11:15] <murthy> louipc: my first open source contribution was to kmix kde volume control :)
[22:11:23] <louipc> murthy: rite. pipewire does it all but better

[22:12:08] <louipc> since stopped using Xorg
[22:12:17] <louipc> too lazy to figure it out for now
[22:12:25] <murthy> louipc: I also think the latency is reduce. I heard that pipewire is best for people who use jack a lot
[22:12:39] <louipc> maybe better switch to pipewire first
[22:12:50] <golrom> s/jack//
[22:12:50] <Janet> golrom thinks murthy meant to say: louipc: I also think the latency is reduce. I heard that pipewire is best for people who use  a lot
[22:13:00] <murthy> louipc: oh pulseaudio works nicely with wayland. alsa doesn't work well with wayland?
[22:13:11] <golrom> why not oss
[22:13:12] <louipc> murthy: alsa works fine with wayland
[22:13:16] <murthy> louipc: nice
[22:13:23] <louipc> just my volume control app doesnt
[22:13:28] <louipc> it was for Xorg only
[22:13:32] <golrom> go bsd, make everything difficult
[22:13:36] <murthy> louipc: But if you are switching to pipewire, don't forget to disable pulseaudio
[22:13:42] <louipc> golrom: LOL no thanks
[22:13:50] <golrom> :D
[22:13:50] <louipc> murthy: i never enabled pulse
