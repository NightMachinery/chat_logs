[00:03:58] <ngoldbaum> wow it‚Äôs so dry
[00:04:11] <ngoldbaum> 79¬∞F with a dew point of 3¬∞F
[00:04:27] <ngoldbaum> surprised the trees aren‚Äôt spontaneously combusting
[00:04:48] <imode> damn ngoldbaum, where you at.

[00:05:09] * defect books tickets to colorado
[00:05:44] <ngoldbaum> yeah pretty unusual november weather
[00:24:21] <riv> wonder what the best budget controller for emulating games with 2 sticks is..
[00:24:37] <riv> xbox controller is probably the best, but i wonder if i can getgsomething similar cheaper
[00:27:10] <pja> There are definitely companies making retro controllers.
[00:27:18] <ngoldbaum> xbox controller is fine, dualsense is fine
[00:27:41] <ngoldbaum> the xbox controller still needs a dumb dongle to work wirelessly on PC iirc
[00:28:03] <riv> i will probably just grab a xbox controller then, i dont mind wires
[00:28:05] <ngoldbaum> and the rechargeable battery pack is still an extra too‚Ä¶
[00:28:22] <pja> 8bitdo makes retro emulator controllers.
[00:28:48] <ngoldbaum> riv is looking for a controller with analog sticks though
[00:28:51] <riv> ooh
[00:29:21] <riv> those are *nice*
[00:29:35] <ngoldbaum> if you have a switch the pro controller is quite nice
[00:29:39] <ngoldbaum> and works with PCs fine
[00:29:41] <pja> ngoldbaum: Some of the 8bitdo ones have sticks.
[00:29:55] <cb_> F310 is tolerable but i find the triggers are fucky

[00:34:26] <buttsbot> Twitter - domenuk - Rust suggests to add this tiny type annotation to my variable.. https://t.co/McYOG83vqj
[00:35:35] <riv> that's what C++ is like
[00:46:35] <imode> ngoldbaum: what the fuck do you have to do to get baphomet to vomit something like that.
[00:47:04] <ngoldbaum> i‚Äôm guessing macros are involved
[00:47:21] <ngoldbaum> something extremely cursed
[00:48:43] <pja> I see Rust has truly achieved C++ template nirvana.
[00:50:51] <ngoldbaum> huh TIL you could also fix that error by putting an underscore in instead of the insane type
[00:51:04] <ngoldbaum> the compiler should suggest that jeeze
[01:14:19] *** Quits: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:17:35] <pja> _ matches all types?
[01:17:46] <pja> is it a typehole like in Haskell?
[01:19:00] <ngoldbaum> it basically tells the compiler that you don‚Äôt care about a value
[01:19:09] <ngoldbaum> i don‚Äôt use haskell
[01:19:53] <ngoldbaum> you can do ‚Äúlet _ = something_with_side_effects()‚Äù if you don‚Äôt care about the result of the function
[01:20:15] <ngoldbaum> apparently you can actually bind to a name and just say you don‚Äôt care about the type
[01:20:26] <ngoldbaum> note that i haven‚Äôt actually tried this so i may be wrong

[03:17:27] <imode> I could be a competent game developer.
[03:17:51] <imode> copious mental masturbation isn't good for the hands. or your eyes.
[03:25:54] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[04:48:27] <dimadima> what's your mental masturbation? it's getting in the way of your productivity you think?
[04:52:52] <imode> ruminating the ideal understandable tech stack from simple beginnings to a distributed multi-user shell.
[04:53:22] <imode> agonizing over every choice because no choices are made for me.
[04:54:35] <dimadima> with regards to game dev?
[04:55:07] <imode> not gamedev, I guess I could continue to be masturbatory and say it's an "attempt at a metaverse".
[04:55:31] <dimadima> does "metaverse" inherently imply VR?
[04:55:36] <imode> god no.
[04:55:50] <dimadima> so not gamedev, but metaverse
[04:55:59] <dimadima> what's a distributed multi-user shell?
[04:56:21] <dimadima> like, i can hop into a screen/tmux w/ someone else
[04:56:30] <dimadima> or do you mean a different kind of shell
[04:56:33] <companion_cube> connecting to tmux via VR ? ü§î
[04:56:38] <companion_cube> that's some hardcore unix stuff there
[04:56:43] <imode> hahahahahahahaha.
[04:57:00] <dimadima> companion_cube: personally i would consider trying VR in lieu of a minutor
[04:57:04] <dimadima> monitor*
[04:57:21] <imode> think like a graphical LambdaMOO. the core concept is that you inhabit some form of shared space, and the behavior of that space (as well as things in it) can change and be authored by users.
[04:57:34] <imode> and it's transparent across geography.
[04:58:21] <companion_cube> that's like playing Doom Eternal at 16 fps on an old CRT screen
[04:58:53] <bkero> You mean like IRC with /me, right?
[04:58:55] <imode> I can be sitting in a simulated cafe with my friends at one moment, then tap a button on my wrist to warp into a simple text chat equivalent to save on bandwidth, or drop into a 3D rendered dungeon crawler.
[04:59:42] <bkero> Heh smoking some of that metaverse weed?
[04:59:59] <imode> think "the web" but less document oriented, more pixel buffer oriented, and adaptable to more devices than screens.
[04:59:59] <imode> authoring content is more granular than "here's this entire experience up front".
[05:00:13] <imode> "you have to design everything hope you have fun with that".
[05:00:28] <imode> bkero: you know it homie. but imo that's where things need to head.
[05:00:50] <bkero> So react.js and apis, but for vr headsets
[05:01:02] <imode> no, no VR. fuck VR.
[05:01:04] <companion_cube> reminds me of a futurama episode
[05:01:07] <bkero> or AR
[05:01:11] <imode> and fuck the "everything needs to be 3D" default.
[05:01:13] <companion_cube> a FUTAMURA EPISODE
[05:01:15] <imode> not AR either lmao.
[05:01:17] <bkero> or really any downscaled experience
[05:01:32] * dimadima first learns about LambdaMOO
[05:01:39] <imode> dimadima: you have a wonderful rabbit hole to go down.
[05:01:45] <dimadima> < bkero> You mean like IRC with /me, right?
[05:01:48] <dimadima> ^
[05:01:55] <bkero> *this rabbit hole ends in the 80s
[05:01:58] <imode> *90s.
[05:02:03] <bkero> in some dude's closet
[05:02:13] <dimadima> lol you guys
[05:02:14] <imode> you've been watching too much earnest cline.
[05:02:17] <imode> ;)
[05:02:19] <bkero> err
[05:02:23] <bkero> log into lambdamoo
[05:02:25] <companion_cube> how comes De Lorean are cool, but not IRC
[05:02:26] <imode> *ernest cline
[05:02:28] <companion_cube> so sad
[05:02:35] <bkero> let me know what room you start in
[05:02:39] <companion_cube> Ernst Cline is a shitty writter
[05:02:53] <imode> bkero: was mostly mentioning "ends in the 80s", lambdamoo was well active into the 90s.
[05:02:59] <imode> well the OG instance was.
[05:03:04] <imode> now there's HellMOO etc.
[05:03:48] <dimadima> this does look like an excellent rabbit hole though
[05:03:50] <imode> companion_cube: I still won't ever forget that thread about an "honest review" of RPO and RPT.
[05:04:14] <imode> that gave me second-hand disgust.
[05:04:18] <imode> and hilarity.
[05:04:56] <companion_cube> :D
[05:05:02] <companion_cube> not sure I've seen that
[05:05:07] <companion_cube> RPO is‚Ä¶ just a bit mediocre
[05:05:13] <companion_cube> like, I did finish the book
[05:05:29] <companion_cube> he also wrote Armada, which, ugh
[05:05:30] <imode> https://twitter.com/laura_hudson/status/1331271143421042688?lang=en
[05:05:30] <buttsbot> Twitter - laura_hudson - Baby, it‚Äôs on https://t.co/In8EhYgDAa
[05:05:34] <imode> holy fuckin shit you are in for a ride.
[05:06:01] <companion_cube> ooooooo
[05:06:16] <imode> (it was funnier without all of the images removed)
[05:08:01] <companion_cube> oh god the start
[05:09:50] <companion_cube> https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17250892/ready-player-one-book-facebook-internet-dystopia guess that's about to become relevant
[05:09:51] <buttsbot> Ready Player One is the roadmap to digital dystopia - The Verge
[05:10:30] <imode> what's sad is that a mentor of mine used to recommend this book highly.
[05:10:43] <imode> pretty sure he skimmed it. either that or he was uh.
[05:10:51] <imode> a very freaky dude and I didn't pick up on that.
[05:11:28] <companion_cube> if you don't look for signs, it's a mediocre book but it reads ok, tbh
[05:11:44] <companion_cube> it did sell pretty well I think
[05:12:14] <imode> how'd you like when the main character jacks off.
[05:12:25] <companion_cube> it's sort of like a modern super hero movie, where there's nothing interesting, but you're not probably going to leave the theater
[05:12:37] <companion_cube> (talking about RPO, didn't read RPT)
[05:12:42] <imode> that's in RPO.
[05:13:58] <companion_cube> hmm I don't even recall üòÇ
[05:14:10] <imode> thank god you don't.
[05:14:39] <companion_cube> not that jacking off is bad per se
[05:15:32] <imode> yeeeeeeeeah but I didn't expect that in a VR fantasy novel.
[05:16:17] <companion_cube> you expect VR without masturbation? how young and naive of you üôÉ
[05:16:33] <imode> oh I _expect_ it. just didn't expect him to go right the fuck in on it.
[05:16:46] <imode> though I guess the whole novel could be said to be a form of masturbation.
[05:17:00] <companion_cube> heh
[05:17:04] <companion_cube> maybe so
[05:17:13] <companion_cube> an ode to the eighties or whatever
[05:17:15] <imode> anyway, no, that ain't the metaverse and I hope to god it never is.
[05:17:17] <companion_cube> to his youth
[05:20:10] <imode> TBL et. al. saw the web as a document store and then bolted on a turing complete language that could manipulate the document. all parts of the web are then isolated from eachother: they communicate over explicit channels (that are relatively new and bolted on) that are all implementing different protocols.
[05:21:23] <companion_cube> > a book about gatekeeping
[05:21:27] <imode> you exit one site and enter another, you hop between sites and networks at a click. this helps with the illusion that the world is running on the same fabric, that things are adjacent to eachother.
[05:21:28] <companion_cube> damn that's an accurate description
[05:21:44] <imode> that sounds about right, including the bits about sorrento lmao.
[05:21:55] <companion_cube> imode: I've read "minecraft is the actual metaverse" somewhere
[05:21:59] <companion_cube> and it'd be kind of cool
[05:22:11] <companion_cube> a game is definitely a  better start for it if we're talking about VR
[05:22:27] <imode> forget VR, try just "the next web".
[05:22:47] <companion_cube> why would  there be a next web?
[05:22:53] <companion_cube> what will sign the death of the current one?
[05:22:54] <imode> because the current one continues to suck.
[05:23:00] <imode> meh, nothing will.
[05:23:10] <imode> technology has staying power.
[05:23:23] <companion_cube> yeah and people who could do something about it invented gemini
[05:23:26] <companion_cube> :p
[05:23:30] <imode> they didn't even fucking try.
[05:23:32] <imode> at least I'm trying.
[05:23:43] <indigo> I read all of Ready Player One because it was highly recommended to me
[05:23:45] <imode> they looked at gopher, said "good enough, it's a document store".
[05:23:50] <indigo> I will never have that time back
[05:24:01] <imode> bahahahahahah fuck that's accurate.
[05:24:08] <companion_cube> at least it was not too much time indigo right?
[05:24:26] <indigo> Yes, not too much time :-)
[05:24:39] <indigo> The book is at a pretty easy level
[05:25:36] <companion_cube> I haven't watched it but I hear that "scott pilgrim" is the same kind of insufferable character"
[05:25:45] <imode> watch it, you're in for a treat.
[05:26:08] <companion_cube> oof
[05:26:18] <companion_cube> I'm not sure I can go through with that
[05:26:21] <imode> and by treat I mean 112 minutes of cringe.
[05:28:54] <companion_cube> so anywya, what's worse
[05:28:58] <companion_cube> web3, or gemini?
[05:29:18] <imode> web3.

[05:30:12] <imode> please feed me to an angle grinder.
[05:30:59] <companion_cube> no, your punishment is to live to watch the inevitable sequel
[05:31:05] <imode> it was released in 2010.
[05:31:17] <imode> thank god it bombed.
[05:31:26] <companion_cube> lolol :D
[05:43:26] <dimadima> web3 is inordinately worse than gemini
[05:43:34] <dimadima> i'm guessing that question was not for real
[05:44:00] <dimadima> but it did trigger me :)
[05:44:07] <dimadima> web3 has been bumming me out tremendously

[05:46:06] <companion_cube> dimadima: yeah that was /s

[05:48:27] <dimadima> "ecological disaster + scam" | :((((
[05:48:36] <dimadima> and a dystopian nightmare
[05:48:39] <dimadima> in the truest since
[05:48:54] <dimadima> got a text from a friend the other day, verbatim: "You know anything about NFT development?"
[05:49:05] <dimadima> :(((((
[05:49:18] <imode> "NFT development" i.e how to construct a hashmap?
[05:49:24] <indigo> Too many books in the Technology section of Barnes and Noble were about cryptocurrency
[05:49:32] <companion_cube> no, how to apply an instagram filter
[05:49:57] <dimadima> this same friend has masters degree in "non-technical cyber security", has had a steady stream of well paying jobs, and didn't know you could install an ad blocker on your web browser as of, what, 3 months ago?
[05:50:04] <dimadima> when i told him about ad blockers
[05:50:48] <dimadima> indigo: interesting
[05:51:14] <dimadima> and sad
[05:51:40] <dimadima> i responded to the text "No sir"
[05:51:57] <dimadima> i wanted to sad "I only engage in non-profitable computing, actualyy"
[05:52:10] <dimadima> but i didn't want to sound too depressed/sarcastic
[05:52:42] <dimadima> because to be honest, whatever he's looking into, i think he's probably a decent chance he'll make some money off of it
[05:52:54] <dimadima> s/he's probably/there's probably/
[05:53:08] <dimadima> s/to sad/to add/
[05:54:19] <companion_cube> just buy the dip‚Ñ¢
[05:55:00] <imode> ..pardon me.
[05:55:05] <imode> what the fuck is "non-technical cyber security"
[05:55:20] <dimadima>  what the fuck is life, imode?
[05:55:31] <imode> a confusing path to the void.
[05:56:06] <companion_cube> imode: buying antivirus by the pound
[05:56:19] <imode> how much does windows defender weigh
[05:57:05] <bkero> one freedom
[05:58:30] <indigo> Hmmm.. thinking of getting an rsync.net account
[05:58:35] <indigo> Apparently iCloud Drive doesn't do versioning
[05:58:45] <companion_cube> imode: I mean going to a strip club with some norton execs to buy 100,000 copies of norton antivirus
[05:58:55] <companion_cube> anyway that's what I imagine it to be like :D
[05:59:40] <indigo> All these lobste.rs backup stories are creepin me out
[06:05:33] <dimadima> personally i'm always stressed out by the "_____ is not a backup"
[06:05:46] <dimadima> true as all those statements may be
[06:08:38] <dimadima> i dunno imode mental masturbation is where it's at, if you ask me
[06:14:01] <bkero> _____ = backup

[06:44:10] <dimadima> maybe
[06:46:45] <bkero> they let their cert expire and use hsts
[06:46:51] <bkero> Good that they use hsts
[06:46:57] <bkero> bad that they let their cert expire today
[06:47:05] <bkero> You can use https://yt.privacyplz.org/ in the meantime if you'd like.

[06:52:51] <dimadima> i guess hitting HSTS when its an expired cert issue isn't as cool as when a state actor hijacks your domain

[07:10:41] <imode> it is WINDY out there.
[07:11:54] <imode> howling winds o' november, haven't heard this for a while.
[07:15:17] <dimadima> it was like that here early last week
[07:15:35] <dimadima> imode i can't stop thinking how in that one screenshot of your dev env you posted the other day you were using nano
[07:15:53] <imode> oh yeh?
[07:15:55] <dimadima> or so it seemed
[07:16:23] <dimadima> yeah it was windy as a MF

[07:16:56] <dimadima> i would find it difficult to work in nano
[07:17:16] <imode> it's alright.
[07:17:17] <dimadima> pretty cool
[07:17:37] <dimadima> so you intellij for work and then nano for pleasure?
[07:18:07] <imode> yep.
[07:18:27] <dimadima> but do you vim mode intellij?
[07:19:07] <imode> nah.
[07:19:19] <dimadima> yeah that makes sense
[07:19:29] <dimadima> i think once you vim you can't do anything else
[07:19:49] <dimadima> i can't not set -o vi
[07:19:57] <dimadima> so i can't use nano, etc
[07:20:24] <imode> I don't enjoy modal editing.
[07:21:16] <dimadima> i can't not modal edit anymore :)
[07:21:26] <dimadima> if i had to use xcode professionally i couldn't do it
[07:21:41] <dimadima> although i hear they're getting proper vi mode or plugins or something
[07:22:16] <dimadima> nano has syntax colors
[07:22:58] <imode> yep.
[07:23:49] <dimadima> cool imode !
[07:24:51] <dimadima> how do you exit nano?

[07:29:01] <dimadima> it's funny they think ^X is clear cause when i was a little kid there was a period when i couldn't figure out wtf that caret meant
[07:29:07] <dimadima> this was before the internet
[07:29:25] <dimadima> i've definitely been stuck in pico, for example
[07:31:14] <dimadima> i think being stuck in pico is how i figured out what ^ meant
[07:32:01] <dimadima> people overestimate how simple nano is, is all i'm saying
[07:32:20] <dimadima> overstate*
[07:32:54] <imode> oh definitely.
[07:33:01] <imode> I had no idea what that caret meant either.
[07:34:19] <imode> it's simple in that it's not complex. there's no hidden complexity in it.
[07:50:37] <dimadima> i guess. it intimidates me for some reaosn
[07:51:13] <dimadima> anyway i hope it didn't sound like i was judging or something; i am often naively interested in people's preferences and people seem to mistake it for being judgemental
[07:51:19] <dimadima> nano is a sensitive topic
[07:53:01] <imode> nah idgaf what people use.
[07:53:08] <dimadima> it was just kind of beautiful when you sent that screenshot; you working on a minimalistic language, using a minimalist editor
[07:53:26] <imode> innit fun? I'd like to build my own editor one day.
[07:53:45] <dimadima> i'm always interested in ppl's preferences
[07:54:00] <dimadima> never want to change them, though
[07:55:23] <imode> people get into editor wars because they have nothing better to do.
[07:55:43] <dimadima> yeah people are pretty crazy
[07:56:11] <imode> if you have tooling that works for you, go for it.
[07:56:34] <dimadima> that's really the end of the story
[07:56:48] <dimadima> what else is there to say
[07:58:00] <imode> nothin', tbh. tools need to speak for themselves. I enjoy obvious tooling.
[07:59:07] <dimadima> you wanna argue about it
[07:59:21] <dimadima> jk i'm tired
[07:59:54] <imode> vim sucks balls.
[08:00:15] <imode> there, I have ignited the fire.
[08:00:32] <imode> actually the proper method for this is to duke it out in #dongers
[08:00:37] <imode> #donger, rather.
[08:00:46] <dimadima> vim does kind of suck balls
[08:00:50] <dimadima> i want to try neovim
[08:01:05] <dimadima> what is donger
[08:01:16] <imode> internet fist fights
[08:01:24] <imode> join it.
[08:04:39] <dimadima> lol
[08:04:43] <dimadima> that was insane
[08:04:47] <imode> it's awesome.
[08:04:57] <dimadima> can't believe i lost
[08:05:08] <imode> !deathmatch initiates a fight that if you lose, you get banned for 20 minutes.
[08:05:28] <dimadima> someone needs to port drugwars onto IRC
[08:05:40] <imode> gotta move dat COKE
[08:05:42] <dimadima> i could legit watch ppl playing drugwars in an IRC channel
[08:05:52] <dimadima> or somehow make it multiplayer
[08:05:58] <dimadima> but single player original works for me
[08:06:14] <dimadima> in fact, they could keep it authentic by somehow having the bot that runs it on IRC interface w/ the original, actual program
[08:06:42] <dimadima> drugwars is the only text-based RPG gave i've ever playedd
[08:06:52] <dimadima> i do love that game very much
[08:07:26] <imode> have never played, oddly enough.
[08:07:34] <imode> wasn't it for a particular TI calculator.
[08:07:34] <dimadima> you might be too old to start now
[08:07:47] <dimadima> there was a TI version but the real version was for DOS
[08:07:59] <imode> OH WAIT
[08:08:01] <imode> I've played that.
[08:08:17] <imode> yeah yeah yeah lmao I played it under DOSBox.
[08:08:35] <dimadima> i really liked it
[08:08:38] <dimadima> i spent hours playing that game

[08:08:55] <buttsbot> Download Drugwars | DOS Games Archive
[08:09:21] <dimadima> most of what i know in life i learned from drugwar.exe
[08:10:31] <imode> bahahahahahaha
[08:10:37] <imode> you are exactly what jack thompson was warning us about.
[08:15:30] <dimadima> just looked him up. sounds like an asshole
[08:15:40] <dimadima> a drugwars IRC bot would rule
[08:15:49] <dimadima> but only an authentic one
[08:16:06] <dimadima> something about how that game was programmed made it mega fun

[13:12:45] <riv> sicp in js would be a bit off. js's function scope is really unusual compared to lexical scope. bit more awkward to work with linked lists I think because they're not built in. mostly it should translate ok
[13:17:30] <dcz_> how about car/cdr? that would be a pain
[14:13:20] <Brekkjern> Why? car is just tuple[0] and cdr is just tuple[1]
[14:29:15] <indigo> I thought JS used lexical scope?
[14:39:34] <riv> it has its own weird version!
[14:39:58] <riv> I suppose the new 'let' thing is lexical scope
[14:43:22] <indigo> Isn‚Äôt `var` still lexical scope?
[14:46:54] <riv> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var  its something slightly different to lexical scope called function scope
[14:46:54] <buttsbot> var - JavaScript | MDN

[17:19:22] <prussian> I must now become a go-expert in a last-ditch effort to evangelize it over python for a specific use
[17:19:28] <prussian> I don't really like it....
[17:23:48] <dimadima> go or that you must evangelize it
[17:23:55] <dimadima> ?
[17:23:57] <prussian> both
[17:24:09] <dimadima> but you like it more than python for this use?
[17:24:19] <prussian> but I'm tired of helping people put python modules onto arm machines.
[17:24:41] <prussian> and people are just wasting times tweaking and creating resource leaks with asyncio lmao
[17:28:06] <prussian> anyhow GOARCH=arm go build just works... that's the point.

[17:46:58] <prussian> damn
[17:47:54] <prussian> dimadima: idk. I'm just tired of seeing the same code over and over being "reworked" for whatever reason and the "performance" issues when I see this tarball made by bespoke tech-lead full of premade .pyc bytecode for the wrong interpreter version on the target as well.
[17:47:54] <prussian> so
[17:47:56] <prussian> idk
[17:48:17] <prussian> I'm just tired of dealing with broken build systems and I want one that "just works" allegedly
[17:48:23] <prussian> and people seem to like go

[17:51:12] <prussian> with no example or elaboration.

[17:51:43] <prussian> it's on some stupid device with only a 2GiB SD Card for filesystem
[17:52:00] <prussian> so it just gets thrown on the rootfs in the gross way it does
[17:52:16] <dimadima> just weird they ship the wrong target etc etc

[17:52:30] <dimadima> i don't get that lol
[17:52:51] <dimadima> if they can't ship the right target, they need more/better build automation

[17:55:47] <Brekkjern> With that I mean that I log on to the box it's hosted on, and push the up key until the last time I deployed it appears :P

[17:58:08] <Brekkjern> Man, this program sucks to optimize.
[17:58:21] <prussian> I need to like, write a weekly plan
[17:58:22] <prussian> or something
[17:58:29] <prussian> and hold myself accountable
[17:58:48] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Why shouldn't one use composite keys?

[17:59:28] <Brekkjern> Please do :D
[17:59:29] <dimadima> but long story short, you may wany to change them in the future
[17:59:35] <Brekkjern> Oh, right.
[18:05:15] <prussian> just do databases the yolo way.

[22:15:42] <dimadima> it is!
[22:15:58] <dimadima> i _really_ dug the seattle area in terms of nature and all that
[22:16:39] <imode> if I had the social tolerance I did in 2014 I would probably be living in Seattle.
[22:17:01] <imode> there is a lot to do. only if you have money though.
[22:27:25] <dimadima> if you're covid averse there's no point in living in seattle
[22:27:29] <dimadima> or any other urban area
[22:28:14] <dimadima> i seem to be slightly less covid averse than you and i certainly wouldn't be doing anything urban these days

[22:49:36] <dimadima> some time later her mom basically yelled at her over the phone for disrespecting her brother
[22:49:45] <imode> ugh..
[22:49:58] <dimadima> comping up, this november, same brother coming for the same reason

[22:51:31] <dimadima> they were increasingly so over the last 10-20 years
[22:51:53] <imode> seems about right..

[22:53:33] <dimadima> they all just think that everything is some con you know
[22:53:40] <dimadima> total nihilism about fucking everything
[22:54:02] <imode> I mean I think that, but I'm not insane.
[22:54:02] <dcz_> didn't the creator of One America just last week come out to say it is all completelly manipulated?
[22:54:04] <dimadima> no ability to distinguish categorically the differece between when the global elite is actually conning you and when they're not
[22:54:22] <dimadima> it's just a pandemic is a pandemic
[22:54:30] <dcz_> and by "it all" I mean his creation
[22:54:30] <dimadima> whther fauci flip fops or not doesnt change the reality
[22:54:37] <imode> yeah.
[22:54:40] <dimadima> yeah the CDC is weird and annoying etc
[22:55:07] <imode> doesn't change that, y'know, it's an infectious, deadly disease.
[22:55:08] <dimadima> dcz_: probably cause he's being sued by Dominion
[22:55:09] <companion_cube> the plandemic, dimadima !!
[22:55:21] <dimadima> dcz_: as of... last week
[22:55:28] <imode> plandemic lmao.
[22:55:29] <dimadima> companion_cube: you kid, but it's true
[22:55:35] <companion_cube> I know they use this term
[22:55:45] <imode> let's go brandon.
[22:55:45] <dimadima> they're taking down trump and anyone who's resisting globalism across the whole world
[22:55:51] <dimadima> it's a coordinated effort
[22:55:56] <dimadima> like we've never seen before
[22:56:07] <imode> globalist elite gay vampires.
[22:56:09] <dimadima> anyway, not looking forward to him coming
[22:56:13] <dimadima> he's a drag in general
[22:56:22] <dimadima> imode: they're turning the FROGS GAY
[22:56:27] <imode> I thought they beat people in drag.
[22:56:38] <dimadima> heh
[22:56:39] <imode> that was a terrible joke I'm sorry.
[22:56:43] <dimadima> took me a sec
[22:56:50] <dimadima> naa they're not the kind of ppl to beat anyone
[22:56:57] <dimadima> her brother is just fucking a dead soul man
[22:57:08] <imode> I can kind of relate.
[22:57:13] <dimadima> heh

[22:57:46] <imode> oh no question but I mean like.
[22:57:52] <imode> about non-medical shit.
[22:57:56] <dimadima> i dunno
[22:58:06] <imode> say what you want about TV but you at least had people accountable for their broadcast content.
[22:58:06] <dimadima> i don't trust anyone in particular
[22:58:20] <imode> now you can poke any part of a network in a particular way to get an idea to spread.
[22:58:34] <imode> and nobody knows who or what the source is.
[22:58:43] <dimadima> yeah hence the insane nihilism
[22:58:56] <imode> imo that's not unjustified.
[22:58:56] <dimadima> it's relatable but i'm more focused on the virus thing
[22:59:06] <dimadima> also yo
[22:59:10] <imode> yeah I can see the fucking effects of the virus with my own eyes.
[22:59:13] <dcz_> TV makes for brilliant unaccountable propaganda too. it's really sad
[22:59:20] <dimadima> what part of your brain is missing that you think rush limbaugh or donald trump are "nie guys"
[22:59:30] <dimadima> "nice guy" is literally how my wife's mom described DJT
[22:59:56] <imode> dcz_: yeah but Mister Rogers isn't going to stand up and say "we need funding to help us provide a nurturing environment for kids to contrast the bullshit everyone airs" in the context of the internet.
[22:59:58] <dimadima> DJT is flagrantly, at the very least, a total asshole

[23:00:56] <imode> you will never hear anything like this on the senate floor again.
[23:00:57] <imode> ever.
[23:01:15] <dimadima> TV is fucking crazy
[23:01:34] <dimadima> lots of ppl defend TV on hacker news
[23:01:45] <dimadima> saying we've been watching TV for generations and nothing bad has happened
[23:01:56] <dimadima> i'm not sure that's true
[23:01:58] <imode> because participatory mediums didn't exist.
[23:02:19] <imode> again, TV had a barrier. you can't just make a TV program and get it to people's eyeballs.
[23:02:28] <dimadima> if OAN is recanting, it's just this same bullshit https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/03/22/facing-defamation-sidney-powell-says-no-reasonable-person-thought-her-election-fraud-claims-were-fact/?slreturn=20211007143106

[23:03:02] <imode> with the advent of social media, you can get any kind of idea in front of people.
[23:03:20] <imode> and you can do it in such an undetectable manner that the average joe will think that he thinks the same thing.
[23:03:32] <dcz_> dimadima: why would this cause recanting? some sort of lighter treatment in exchange for being cooperative?
[23:03:33] <imode> you can't _do that_ with a medium like TV.
[23:03:33] <dimadima> TV was pretty insidious too though
[23:03:53] <dimadima> dcz_: sort of like a strategic backing away
[23:03:55] <imode> I agree. 24 hour news networks were a horrible invention.
[23:04:03] <imode> and yet, evil there has a face.
[23:04:10] <imode> who's the evil face behind TikTok trends.
[23:04:18] <imode> who's the proprietor of all of this chaos.
[23:04:22] <imode> nobody knows.
[23:04:43] <dcz_> Moloch
[23:05:03] <imode> pstate-sponsored and private astroturfing campaigns have gotten so fucking cheap to deploy these days.
[23:05:08] <imode> *state-sponsored
[23:05:38] <dcz_> are you extrapolating or do you have actual numbers?
[23:05:42] <imode> you will never have a Mister Rogers stand up and say "we need a PBS for the internet".
[23:06:18] <imode> dcz_: I mean, look at 2016. most of the research started there, but there's evidence of these things going back to the mid 2000's.
[23:06:28] <imode> operation earnest voice, that's a well-documented one.
[23:06:41] <imode> "troll-farms", the media had a field day with that one.

[23:27:58] <imode> hm.
[23:28:14] <imode> so I'm revisiting a language that I was working on that didn't quite work out.
[23:28:51] <imode> it was a term rewriting language, but "optimized" to be really tiny.
[23:29:14] <imode> https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/raw/dedafixovu
[23:29:14] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[23:30:10] <imode> was enough to write the haskell version of quicksort (with all the duplication that involves) pretty succinctly.
[23:30:46] <riv> how does it avoid infinite loop with quote? is the quote rule necessary?
[23:31:08] <imode> yep. because that prevents the evaluator from reducing that particular branch.
[23:31:29] <imode> the way it works is that the whole tree is held in a giant queue (if you've noticed, I have a thing for queues).
[23:31:43] <imode> the head of the queue is tested against each rule.
[23:32:14] <imode> if a rule fires, the matched head of the queue is dequeued, variables are bound appropriately, a pattern is constructed and then enqueued.
[23:33:13] <bkero> Crap, I have some weird hardware to sell that doesn't apper anywhere online. Like a Novena laptop.
[23:33:28] <imode> so.. `quote (foo) <some-other-stuff>` becomes `<some-other-stuff> quote (foo)`
[23:33:33] <imode> after a single rewrite.
[23:33:54] <imode> it's effectively a breadth-first traversal of a tree that's constantly undergoing rewrites.
[23:34:57] <imode> here's an interpreter. https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/ofucorelaf.py
[23:34:57] <buttsbot> hastebin
[23:35:46] <imode> there is an unfinished implementation of it in C.
[23:35:52] <imode> similarly small.
[23:36:28] <imode> I didn't like the language because it was relatively inconsistent, but I go back to it every so often and mess with it for like, a day or two.
[23:36:41] <imode> the pattern matching is a little unintuitive.
[23:37:15] <imode> a pattern like (foo ?a ?b) will match (foo (bar baz) (quux (asdf foobar))).
[23:37:22] <ngoldbaum> bkero: ship it to foone
[23:37:34] <imode> but a pattern like (foo (?a) (?b)) will only match (foo (bar) (baz)).
[23:37:43] <companion_cube> that seems legit imode
[23:37:57] <imode> and a pattern like (foo (?a ?b) (?c ?d)) will only match (foo (bar baz) (quux asdf)).
[23:37:59] <companion_cube> like, that's normal matching
[23:38:05] <imode> right.
[23:38:18] <imode> the evaluation method, though, is definitely not normal.
[23:38:32] <companion_cube> question is, does `(foo (?a ?b))` match `(foo (a b c))`
[23:38:36] <imode> it does not.
[23:38:42] <companion_cube> so no currying ok
[23:38:43] <imode> arity is strict.
[23:38:45] <imode> yup.
[23:38:51] <imode> hence why in quicksort you see that I had to fake lambdas.
[23:38:58] <imode> it's also not exactly a strict tree.
[23:39:10] <imode> more like a delimited string.
[23:39:22] <imode> as is the case in the "?number in ?base".
[23:40:22] <imode> you can "fake" it by having pairs. (?foo ?bar) can match (foo (bar baz quux)) and (foo (bar (baz quux))).
[23:40:53] <imode> earlier versions didn't feature arithmetic so you just had giant piles of successor terms.
[23:41:08] <imode> i.e (s(s(s(s 0))))
[23:41:27] <imode> at its core I think it's a strongly intuitive language at times.
[23:41:42] <imode> but I never got to polishing it.
[23:42:57] <companion_cube> peano arith does suck though
[23:43:03] <imode> yep!
[23:43:07] <companion_cube> if you want something minimalistic there's some super cool ternary arithmetic
[23:43:26] <imode> oh definitely.
[23:43:48] <companion_cube> (I like the ternary one because it handles positive and negative values symmetrically)
[23:44:28] <imode> if you plug in range (10) (20) into that interpreter you'll get an endless cycle of `if/else ( ( 10 ) == ( 21 ) ) quote ( nil ) quote ( ( 10 : range ( 10 + 1 ) ( 20 ) ) )`
[23:44:58] <imode> you may be asking "well, what's going on there?"
[23:45:25] <imode> (this is the primary reason I stopped messing with it)
[23:45:48] <imode> it's hard to debug, but the reason is that I changed the equality operator from infix to prefix.
[23:45:52] <imode> to test some things.
[23:48:05] <imode> I probably messed up some other things as well.
[23:49:03] <imode> ahah, I know why.
[23:49:08] <imode> https://git.imode.tech/?p=python/modal;a=blob_plain;f=prelude.modal;hb=refs/heads/master
[23:49:08] <buttsbot> git.imode.tech Git - python/modal/summary
[23:49:24] <imode> OG prelude didn't do stuff like ?x == ?x, it only compared unary terms.
[23:50:12] <imode> now `range (10) (20)` gives you ( 10 : ( 11 : ( 12 : ( 13 : ( 14 : ( 15 : ( 16 : ( 17 : ( 18 : ( 19 : ( 20 : nil ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
[23:51:46] <imode> and rightfully so, now, sum (reverse (range (10) (20))) gives you 165.
[23:52:53] <imode> and running `quicksort reverse (range (10) (20))` gives you the proper sorted list. in a not-so-quick fashion.
[23:55:05] <imode> anyway, lost in the weeds. I feel like it had potential at some point. the idea was to first port it to C, then reduce that to some optimized assembly, and then eventually port it over to verilog. term rewriting on bare metal, brah.
[23:55:29] <imode> but it's very easy to write rules that are inconsistent and don't play nice with eachother because of the freeform nature of it all.
[23:55:51] <imode> it's definitely more readable and malleable than a forth environment.
[23:56:20] <imode> and you could bolt a type system on top.
[23:57:43] <imode> hell at one point I had a list builder that used <. and .> to turn sequences of <. 1 2 3 4 5 .> into (1 : (2 : (3 : (4 : (5 : nil)))))
