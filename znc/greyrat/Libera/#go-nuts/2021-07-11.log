[02:12:40] <b0nn> Under this approach, the set of modules recorded in the go.mod file would in most cases increase beyond the set recorded in Go 1.14. However, the set of modules recorded in the go.sum file would decrease: irrelevant modules would no longer be included.

[02:17:13] <mayhew> that's fantastic, sweet. I tried out the 1.17 beta just now and it didn't fix the problem, likely because it won't change until pgx itself updates their go.mod file to go.1.17 too.

[02:19:30] <mayhew> I only care about the packages that will end up in my binary. What pgx uses for testing or for subpackages I don't use isn't my concern, hence I shouldn't have to see it in my go.sum file -- that's my perspective.
[02:20:23] <b0nn> So, your testers won't know in advance all of the projects that they will need to test your binary?
[02:20:45] <b0nn> I mean, I guess there's a point there that test stuff should be recorded in a second file
[02:21:45] <b0nn> but the same argument could be proffered for.. oh this is only used for MIPS, this is only used for Windows, and so on
[02:22:20] <mayhew> not too sure what you mean, the people testing my binary (only me) aren't going to be testing pgx itself.
[02:23:37] <b0nn> ok, I work in teams that have CI/CD systems that need to run all the tests before the binary makes it to prod
[02:23:49] <lazyreader> go.sum is not a lock file. The list of packages there is a list of every package used to _determine_ the packages required, not a set of all packages built into your binary
[02:24:07] <b0nn> nobody said it was a Lock" file
[02:24:14] <lazyreader> For all intents and purposes you should ignore its contents.
[02:24:53] <lazyreader> yeah but that felt like the concern, “why are all these packages showing up from my one dependency?”
[02:24:59] <mayhew> b0nn: so if you were writing an application that used pgx, you'd literally run pgx's test suite in your CI or am I misunderstanding?
[02:25:56] <b0nn> That's a misunderstanding.

[02:33:47] <j416> perhaps as simple as that.
[02:34:17] <j416> mayhew: you'd want go.sum to list indirect non-test dependencies, right.
[02:34:30] <mayhew> j416: I believe so, and it doesn't check if depdendencies are unreachable either -- for example if you never use a subpackage
[02:34:34] <b0nn> "When I last built this app it was using these zillion *versions*, including the test stuff"
[02:34:39] <j416> mayhew: if it doesn't distinguish test dependencies from non-test dependencies, it'd just list all the test deps too
[02:34:45] <j416> mayhew: right.

[07:27:49] <dante443> Is it possible to dynamically establish switch/select case statements at runtime? If I iterated through the case condition and match expressions could I create that dynamically at runtime?
[07:29:16] *** Joins: andlabs (~andlabs@71.190.119.164)
[07:29:49] <dante443> I just want a more generic abstraction for the for select loop so that I can pass a func an array of structs with {condition:, exec: fn(), vars:} and then have the channel listen as needed. Is there a different pattern that fits this use case?

[07:30:42] <kodah> dante443: no
[07:30:57] <kodah> you can make the cases expressions though

[07:33:33] <dante443> Ah gotcha. I guess I'll just have to hard code the selects and use a closure. Thanks

[17:41:21] <j416> libs for this).

[21:06:53] <usr123> Maybe we should suggest a documentation change to add that NextReader is blocking?
[21:07:31] <ikke> Why this one specifically?
[21:09:04] <ikke> All functions are blocking by default
[21:09:23] <ikke> they can only return when they finished what they need to do
[21:09:31] <usr123> ikke: Nothing specific here, it's just I used that in my code and I didn't know it was blocking and was trying to understand the flow of program. Maybe it could be helpful if all the calls that are blocking are mentioned?
[21:10:41] <ikke> usr123: You'd be finished much sooner if you mentioned functions that are non-blocking
[21:10:43] <usr123> ikke: True, but when a function/method returns an error, isn't it sort of ambiguous? I might be wrong, but this was in a never ending loop waiting for messages, I thought okay, it returns an error whenever there is nothing to read from the connection and the message when there is a message.
