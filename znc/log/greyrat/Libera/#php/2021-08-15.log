[04:04:09] <deltab> Blondie101010: no, the closest ones are |= and ??=
[04:04:57] <Blondie101010> sad
[04:05:10] <Blondie101010> though |= and casting later does the job
[04:10:35] <deltab> in python |= would work for that: it keeps a bool result if both operands are bool
[04:11:07] <deltab> you could do conditional assignment instead
[04:11:38] <deltab> if ($b) { $a = true; }
[04:15:44] <Blondie101010> of course
[04:15:59] <Blondie101010> not very practical
[04:16:28] <Blondie101010> a simpler patch would be $cond = $cond || operation();

[14:37:37] <Simplar> If I have a class extending another class which has some array variables, how do I add new keys to these arrays in an extended class without overwriting all existing keys?
[14:46:23] <AllenJB>  Simplar: It's not exactly clear what you're trying to do. Properties are accessible by all classes in a hierarchy (extends) (unless they are private). You can add new entries to an array from any child using something like $this->array["key"] = $value;
[14:46:50] <Simplar> AllenJB: is there a 'constructor' kind of thing where I can set those?
[14:47:10] <Simplar> The method which runs when a new class instance is created
[14:47:29] <AllenJB> Simplar: https://www.php.net/__construct
[14:47:57] <Simplar> Oh, aha
[14:48:13] <Simplar> Is it mandatory to call parent constructor in child constructor in class extension?
[14:48:21] <Simplar> Or the parent auto-constructs itself before the child
[14:48:41] <AllenJB> No. You can choose to not call the parent constructor, so you ovverride it completely
[14:49:44] <Simplar> Thanks!
[14:50:10] <AllenJB> (This does mean that if, in the future, you make changes to the parent class that involve the constructor, a child class instance could end up in an invalid state tho!)
[14:51:48] <Simplar> Is there a way to set multiple array keys for such array from the constructor?
[14:52:00] <Simplar> Such as k => v kind of thing when defining an arrya
[14:52:02] <Simplar> array*
[14:53:05] <AllenJB> I don't think so. But you can use array_merge to append arrays. eg. $originalArr = array_merge($originalArr, $extraArr)
[14:53:50] <Simplar> Hm, I also just researched the docs and found array_merge. Guess that's my best bet :)

[15:32:44] <Simplar> Does PHP have a syntax for a single-action if?
[15:32:55] <Simplar> For example, `if($condition) doSomething();`
[15:33:05] <Simplar> or do I always need curly brackets
[15:37:49] <AllenJB> Not sure it's exactly what you're looking for, but there's the short ternary: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php#language.operators.comparison.ternary
[15:37:51] <da_wunder> no you don't need those
[15:39:04] <da_wunder> couple simple examples - https://3v4l.org/N7TSa
[15:39:31] <AllenJB> oh, the curly braces. Yes, you can leave them out for a single action. Few people generally do tho as it can be prone to errors and makes the code harder to read (in my opinion).
[15:39:46] <da_wunder> ^
[15:41:31] <Simplar> Aha. Gotcha.

[19:13:30] <TML> Rockwood: I couldn't possibly disagree more. I wish I could get paid to study - there's not a single topic I've ever come across that I found boring to study.
