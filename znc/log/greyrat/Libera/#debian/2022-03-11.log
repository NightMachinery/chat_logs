[00:01:40] <alkisg> You mean that you run `poweroff -f` as root and it doesn't shutdown or even hang on shutdown?
[00:01:59] <alkisg> What does "unchanged state" mean, that poweroff doesn't do anything, or that it hangs on shutdown?
[00:02:01] <curmudgeon> correct
[00:02:12] <curmudgeon> poweroff doesn't do anything
[00:03:22] <curmudgeon> not one service or app got 'killed' stopped and or otherwise. it is like poweroff is an empty file

[00:16:04] *** Quits: mthall (~quassel@mail.thalliman.com) (Client Quit)
[00:16:07] <somiaj> because halt doesn't power off
[00:16:27] <somiaj> halt and poweroff are different.
[00:16:42] *** Joins: mthall (~quassel@mail.thalliman.com)
[00:17:10] <somiaj> from 'man halt', Note that on many SysV systems halt used to be synonymous to poweroff, i.e. both commands would equally result in powering the machine off. systemd is more accurate here, and halt results in halting the machine only (leaving power on), and poweroff is required to actually power it off.
[00:17:27] <somiaj> so it sounds like it is working as designed
[00:18:53] <curmudgeon> okay. i used to use halt from back in the day. still use it on gentoo. So systemctl poweroff should be the most effective?
[00:19:21] <greycat> I've always used "shutdown -h now" due to my commercial Unix background.
[00:19:30] <curmudgeon> that makes sense.
[00:19:44] <greycat> (or shutdown -r now, for a reboot)
[00:20:59] <Megaf> somiaj: #debian-devel seems to be dead... #
[00:21:05] * alkisg has been using plain poweroff and reboot even before systemd; at that time, they required root, now I can even run them without sudo if I'm the sole logged in user
[00:21:22] <Megaf> #debian-next*
[00:21:26] <greycat> Megaf: you checked on the *other* network, yes?
[00:21:36] <somiaj> Megaf: Just be patient, your request is very very specific
[00:21:46] <somiaj> Megaf: the answer will most likely be just wait until the fixes make it into debian
[00:21:48] <Megaf> greycat: yep, I'm on OFTC

[10:53:31] <Ooze> Hello. I have a seedbox on which I'm trying to sort best file permissions. rtorrent, flood, plex, and maybe more users need access to some media files mounted on a drive via NFS. Am I best off adding these users to a group and then assigning 775 to the files?

[18:32:33] <brm_> Sorry all, am i assume correctly when read tracker like on this link https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0847 meaning if i have bullseye kernel version eg 5.10-46-5 it should be not vulnerable ?
[18:34:09] <jelly> brm_, what does "uname -a" say?
[18:35:00] <jelly> if it says ... 5.10.103-1 ... then you're fine
[18:36:23] <brm_> the uname -a output is like this: 5.10.0-8-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.46-5
[18:37:03] <jelly> that is very old, not fine
[18:37:14] <jelly> 46 < 103
[18:37:59] <jelly> brm_, the easiest way to keep latest, patched up kernel installed is to install "linux-image-amd64" metapackage
[18:38:25] <tomreyn> and to reboot after kernel updates are installed
[18:38:29] <jelly> it will always pull in the newest real kernel package via dependencies

[19:02:02] <zoug> hello, anyone can help me with knockd? How can I enable this? Doing systemctl enable knockd tells me "The unit files have no installation config (WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, Also=, Alias= settings in the [Install] section, and DefaultInstance= for template units). This means they are not meant to be enabled using systemctl.". I've specified
[19:02:02] <zoug> "START_KNOCKD=1" in /etc/default/knockd, but I don't understand how knockd could be started this way if I reboot my machine. And I can't really not have it starting, since I use this port knocking for SSH and don't want to be locked out. Can anyone help me? Thanks a lot
[19:02:28] <Khepra> zoug: is there a .socket unit?
[19:03:22] <zoug> Khepra how could I check that? sorry I don't know what that is
[19:05:13] <Khepra> zoug: nevermind, I see the package doesn't carry .socket, so it's not socket activated

[19:08:03] <zoug> I mean, it probably will be started since there is a START_KNOCKD=1 option in /etc/default/knockd. I just don't understand how that works, and since I would be locked out if it reboots, I really want to make sure
[19:10:29] <Khepra> zoug: is this debian buster?
[19:11:15] <Khepra> zoug: nvm, bullseye has the same code.   it would appear the service units and scripts are incomplete.
[19:11:51] <Khepra> in sid, the .service unit comes with proper installation target. I don't know how bullseye's knockd was supposed to be run, unless that's a glaring bug there, which somehow passed through RC
[19:12:17] <jelly> Khepra, stretch-lts however has a patched up 4.19.  Perhaps you should be running stretch not buster.
[19:12:19] * jelly hides
[19:12:41] <Khepra> zoug: normally, the unit would have the  [Install] section, as seen here: https://sources.debian.org/src/knockd/0.8-2/debian/knockd.service/    but again I don't know how the maintainer imagine the bullseye service to work.
[19:13:20] <Khepra> jelly: jokes aside, 4.19 has some major bug in the dm-crypt layer which interacts with ZFS very destructively every few weeks. I _had_ to bump the kernel.
[19:13:31] <jelly> noice
[19:13:46] <jelly> bump it furtherer.
[19:14:18] <Khepra> for now, stable's kernel is patched fast enough :)
[19:14:26] <zoug> Khepra I think I figured it out. Doing "systemctl is-enabled knockd" returns "static", which I had never seen, a Google search returned this: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=147964
[19:14:26] <jelly> bullseye kernel builds on buster installations!  Cats and mice sleeping together!
[19:14:37] <Khepra> that's servers. I keep 5.15 on the workstation and that one's from kernel.org. bpo suxxxx

[19:15:27] <Khepra> zoug: is it enabled? what does  "status" say?
[19:16:39] <zoug> Khepra well since it's used for port knocking, I think they know people would run into issues, so they specified that. status returns "Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/knockd.service; static)", so static here again, not enabled
[19:16:50] <Khepra> zoug: also /etc/default/<stuff>  is not as important as you think. that's just environemnt sourced by the service unit, but the unit has to be enabled to even start

[19:18:06] <zoug> Khepra yeah but again, since this "static" is specified so the unit is automatically enabled, the env file specifies START_KNOCKD and the program checks that value to know if it should run or not
[19:18:13] <Khepra> zoug: right, so it actually doesn't run unless pulled in by a dependency. maybe you're expected to make it a hard-dependency of sshd? no ida.
[19:18:43] <Khepra> zoug: personally, I find all that too much work for very little gain. I don't use knockd. separate port is apparently more than sufficient, I have yet to see a single login attempt from a bot.
[19:19:22] <Khepra> zoug: but what program? is there a knockd process running after you install it?

[20:37:21] <Adoi> precisely the two words I hear every time I have a desktop problem on Debian in the last 2-3+ years; Wayland and Gnome.

[20:39:16] <jhutchins> Adoi: If you don't like hearing this, maybe you need an OS with a fully integrated desktop like osX or Windows.
[20:40:14] <Adoi> no I dont need either. I just need Linux working the way it did until now, not to mention that we are talking about a function like copy-paste.

[22:21:21] <jhutchins> I suspect that the CIFS configuration ca. Lenny has become obsolete.
[22:21:43] <Khepra> jhutchins: I think I found the solution with the help of #systemd folks. Retesting now to confirm this is indeed the fix....

[22:30:58] <Khepra> jhutchins: somiaj: right. so the solution here was to enable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service. THEN, the network-online.target actually waits until the addresses are set on the NIC. without that service, network-online.target is useless.

[23:25:26] <jhutchins> Shouldn't I expect something line mount.cifs to be properly configured to require networking?
[23:25:48] <jhutchins> (Whatever does the mounts at boot ..._)
[23:25:49] <Khepra> jhutchins: do you also have "netdev" in the fstab mount options?
[23:26:04] <jhutchins> The fstab entries include _netdev
[23:26:09] <Khepra> _netdev yea
[23:26:21] <Khepra> you're using ifupdown for network?
[23:27:05] <Khepra> ah!   there IS   ifupdown-wait-online.service
[23:27:17] <jhutchins> They've also worked correctly through two or three releases until stretch.

[23:48:18] <somiaj> Khepra: ahh maybe that service is disabled by default similar to networkd is disabled by default
[23:54:07] <Khepra> somiaj: but even for ifupdown, ifupdown-wait-online.service is disabled
[23:55:14] <somiaj> ahh, good to know if others have this issue
[23:55:57] <somiaj> wonder if they do this to speed up boot time for the majority of users who may not need to wait
[23:56:28] <somiaj> but at least we know it is a configuration issue and not a bug/issue with the services.
[23:56:32] <Khepra> possibly. this is a bit of an edge case, binding to specific IP(v6) rather than "*"
[23:57:31] <Khepra> somiaj: actually it might even be a bug with the services. someone in #systemd suggested you need After=network-online.target but also Wants=network-online.target. Now, I have some machines here that work without that Wants=, and some that do require it. The plot thickens.
[23:58:14] <Khepra> at any rate, none of this was an issue on buster. started having these issues with the upgrade (mostly re-installation, some apt full-upgrades) to bullseye.
[23:58:19] <somiaj> systemd can be overly complicated, and takes a bit to learn.
[23:59:10] <Khepra> I wouldn't say complicated as much as "not obvious".
[23:59:36] <Khepra> but seeing that this *-wait-online.service IS documented, but not enabled in debian, I wonder if this is actually a debian bug.
