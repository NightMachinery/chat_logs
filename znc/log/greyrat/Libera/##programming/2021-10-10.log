[01:12:33] <arahael> Why do you want cooperative?
[01:12:40] <Guest2> what
[01:12:55] <vdamewood> Yeah, at the very least there were Amigas that had both a 68000k processor and a PPC processor.
[01:13:03] <vdamewood> 69000k? oops.
[01:13:11] <arahael> I've seen Acorn systems that had some sort of Acorn-specific CPU *and* a 486.
[01:13:29] <Decker> because the latter can often emulate the former without any real hit?
[01:13:40] <vdamewood> The Playstation 2 had a fully working Playstation CPU.
[01:14:14] <vdamewood> I forget what the PlayStation 2 CPU was but the PS1 had a MIPS CPU.
[01:14:14] <arahael> A fully working playstation *1* CPU, worth clarifying that. ;)
[01:14:45] <vdamewood> arahael: Though, technically, it was called the 'Playstation' not the 'Playstation 1'.
[01:14:51] <Decker> arahael cooperative is a lot easier to coordinate, but harder to develop for - you have to be aware of more of the system
[01:15:29] <Guest2> you could even delagate simple things to the simpler CPU
[01:15:32] <arahael> Decker: I'm not sure if it's "easier to coordinate" as such?

[01:15:52] <Decker> hmm easier to implement the coordination of ?
[01:15:54] <vdamewood> Guest2: That deligation is present in modern ARM systems, including Apple's M1.
[01:16:20] <Guest2> nice
[01:16:22] <Decker> it's a lot more work to save a program in an arbitrary state, than to have it go 'letOtherThingsRun()'
[01:16:37] <Guest2> but i still require a switch that turns my computer from windows 10 to commodore 64
[01:17:14] <arahael> Decker: Why would you save in an arbitrary state?  Are we assuming no MMU, and no thread support in the kernel?
[01:17:16] <Guest2> or just a freaking linux terminal
[01:17:17] <Decker> Guest2 a Rpi, on USB, use a jumper or something, and have the program watch for 'run C64Emulator' when a button is hit
[01:17:19] <Decker> viola
[01:18:09] <Decker> arahael non-cooperative is the other altneriatve, which means the program has no say, and doesn't nessecarily have any rules to follow
[01:18:26] <vdamewood> Guest2: If you want to switch between a C64 and a modern Windows system, you're pretty screwed since they have no hardware in common. You would basically need both complete systems anyway.
[01:18:32] <Decker> if we're talking JS VM, well sure, let it fall off the stack and process events until there's another stack to run
[01:18:44] <Decker> but that's not what things were(or are in linux or windows scheduling)
[01:18:55] <Guest2> well it's a fun idea anyway
[01:19:08] * vdamewood hands Guest2 a KVM switch.
[01:19:42] * Guest2 burns it
[01:19:44] <arahael> Decker: I know the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative multitasking, I think I just disagree that non-cooperative is *harder* to coordinate, especially given modern hardware and modern software techniques.
[01:20:06] <Decker> (to implement the coordination of)

[01:22:13] <arahael> Decker: That's no different in either environment, though?
[01:22:58] <arahael> Decker: Unless you're talking about global state, in a single-CPU, single-core system.
[01:23:25] <Guest2> imagine if the zuckergoogles went to war with oil and gas
[01:23:51] <Decker> vs windows/linux page map swappnig, register capture, stack saving and paging
[01:24:23] <Decker> I guess though I'd implement it different being older and wiser... 
[01:24:54] <Decker> the VM for Dekware worked really well actually, and I never realized it was actually exactly what JS did
[01:25:05] <Guest2> do you guys see though that there is dire need for a non-internet connected system hardwired so we can just jump out of the ai madness quickly and safely
[01:25:07] <Decker> until way later (2 decades I guess)

[01:26:05] <vdamewood> JanC: I'd say processors, sure, but only one CPU.

[01:29:26] <arahael> Decker: If I had just the bare metal, then we would need to consider the architecture.  Does it have any hardware multithreading support? Does it need to run plugins (ie, user-contributed modules, aka 'applications'?) Does it have hardware support that would allow non-cooperative multitasking?
[01:29:36] <deniska> We ran out of semiconductors arranged in a very specific way :)

[06:40:14] <DPA> A main/event loop & cooperative multitasking is a pretty often used architecture.
[06:40:34] <Thedarkb2> It makes sense for the Zelda clone I'm now on round three of trying to make.
[06:41:37] <Guest61> cooperative multitasking is fake concurrency

[06:41:49] <oldlaptop> This is usually associated with modern operating systems with preemptive multitasking: control is regularly transferred to the operating system, which tries to divide execution time among various independent processes and less-independent threads, which can all be said to be executing /concurrently/, even if there is only one processor and only one is ever executing at once.
[06:42:26] * Thedarkb2 shrugs.
[06:42:27] <oldlaptop> There is no reason it needs to be that way, however. Why can't a userspace program manage concurrent tasks itself?
[06:42:43] <Thedarkb2> As long as all the entities get all of their events handled before the next frame, what's the problem?
[06:43:13] <DPA> I like "async" in JS and Python. It's cooperative multitasking on steroids.
[06:44:02] <Thedarkb2> I'm doing this in C, the entities are in a hash table and they can register callbacks for events.
[06:44:16] <oldlaptop> This is, as DPA and Thedarkb2 observe, a common pattern; sometimes it looks like what operating systems people call "cooperative multitasking", where processes decide when to transfer control to the operating system, and sometimes they'll even implement a form of preemption (as with so-called "green threads" as historically used with Java).
[06:44:50] <ricky_clarkson> oldlaptop: Without preemptive multitasking one app can completely freeze a system by not yielding control.
[06:44:55] <Thedarkb2> Each event has a linked list of callbacks that need to be called when that event occurs.
[06:45:22] <oldlaptop> It's still concurrency, and involves a lot of the same problems, though being careful about when a task yields can obviate a lot of locking and critical-section problems.
[06:45:50] <oldlaptop> ricky_clarkson: This is why the operating systems people don't generally write operating systems with that kind of scheduler anymore.
[06:46:15] <oldlaptop> Lots of user-level programs apply the same basic concept, though.
[06:46:24] <Thedarkb2> If one of those entities decides to computer ackermann(4,5), the game will be dropping some frames.

[11:34:44] <pyzozord> the current state of things does seem needlessly complex

[11:35:05] <pikapika> pyzozord, there has to be it somewhere
[11:35:17] <mrig> There are psychological forces at play that are simple but tricky to get around.
[11:35:21] <pikapika> The complexity will be there, people are disagreeing as to its distribution
[11:35:29] <pikapika> asm is a simple language, the complexity is pushed to the programmer
[11:35:39] <pyzozord> we realy painted ourselves into the corner jsut stacking software complexity. We now have slow, brittle and complex software
[11:35:46] <mrig> some just love the complexity and they will fight to keep it.
[11:36:09] <pikapika> These minimalist C app types you know the suckless sort, they are reliant on a base of some extreme complex os code and extremely complex hardwares

[11:38:14] <pikapika> pyzozord, but there is a reason we can write such simple code
[11:38:18] <pikapika> Its because the hardware has become so fast
[11:38:28] <pikapika> we don't need to develop complex algorithms and can just brute force most things
[11:39:32] <pyzozord> pikapika: I believe that a lot of complexity comes from solving the wrong problems

[12:34:57] <mrig> oh just because of the beauty of it, its like working with mechanics.
[12:35:31] <deniska> it's not like you can address individual bits directly on almost any architecture
[12:35:43] <deniska> computers are kind of base 256 nowadays if you think about it :)
[12:35:43] <mrig> amazed by how musical an error is at low level, as my sound buffer is producing harmonics all by itself at the moment :)
[12:36:19] <mrig> and bit shifting, using confined word sizes, kind of calls to that same thing.
[12:37:31] <mrig> From what is being said of in this lecture, it is not to get rid of all the abstraction, but just to put it atop something that is accessible, then you get the best of both worlds.

[13:57:26] <mrig> macaw: oh this is just a result of the way that the code in this tutorial is structured, I've not yet understood why it is that it is doing what it is doing.

If you leave it running the graduation
[13:57:28] <mrig> resolution reduces bit by bit until it ends up jumping in segments that are the size of the initial notes harmonics. I kind of wish that the tutorial was being written now so that I could ask why it is that it does this.

[14:17:26] <Hash> For example:
[14:17:26] <pikapika> Instead of superficial bullshit
[14:17:28] <Hash> Where speed metal and hardcore warned us of the apocalypse, death metal assumed it as society wailed on toward demise with a whimper and not any drastic warning-type motion. Civilization has become decadent and valueless, and escaping the cycle of rebellion death metal projects a world before the moralization of values, in which personal values can triumph. Death metal denies inherent value
[14:17:30] <Hash> in tone and ideal, and deconstructs the overbearing sense of world and social bounds around us with primal music bearing complexity in texture and theme. The music and lifestyles of the death metal genre employ intuition and logic to replace deconstructed illusion with structuralist sensibility and a sensitivity toward existential value. Unlike most music which focuses on humanist or romantic
[14:17:32] <Hash> themes, death metal articulates the lawless extremity of nature.
[14:17:46] <Hash> People don't write like this normally. This is ... metal.
[14:17:50] <pikapika> Its all self contradictory shit
[14:17:56] <pikapika> Their later writings present death metal as romantic

[16:45:29] <pyzozord> would having say 20000 tiny .so libraries be inefficient or otherwise heavy on the system?

[16:45:51] <Rounin> smallville7123: At such a small scale, you're not going to get a lot of rounding errors, because the integer precision of a float is still quite high
[16:46:27] <Rounin> smallville7123: You'll have to round some way when you're done, though, unless you want to use sub-pixel drawing of some kind... But float allows you to round either way, whereas integer division only rounds down
[16:46:38] <Rounin> Unless you add 1 before dividing...
[16:47:00] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I'm going to have a .so with every room in my game in it.
[16:47:24] <Thedarkb-Desktop> And another .so for entities.
[16:47:29] <Rounin> Anyway, with a precision equivalent to a 24-bit integer or so, a float isn't going to lose any data when using today's screen sizes

[19:23:34] <[itchyjunk]> the package is linked with jUnit 5 test. i am not really sure where assertThat comes from. i have a assertEquals that works so i was hoping i had all the assert* available to me
[19:24:02] <Bombe> In order to use assertThat the way you use it, it must have been imported. How does that import look?
[19:24:35] <GeDaMo> jamea: you need to insert separate values into tab2 rather than strings of numbers
[19:24:41] <Bombe> Alternatively you can leverage the power of your IDE and ctrl/cmd-click it and then tell us the class it takes you to. :)

[21:47:48] <oldlaptop> it's trickier on macos in that there are compatibility breaks other than i386/amd64, and there were relatively few i386 OSX machines anyway

[21:50:45] <oldlaptop> It would be interesting to see how many windows systems are still win32-only.

[21:51:30] <pulse> not really
[21:51:43] <Guest91> i thought 64 bit was deemed too much for practical use?
[21:51:49] <oldlaptop> Not ia32-only hardware, win32-only windows installations. Lots and lots of those on amd64 hardware.
[21:51:53] <oldlaptop> Guest91: How so?
[21:52:09] <Guest91> oldlaptop i just remember people saying it's too much when it came out and pointless
[21:52:33] <oldlaptop> All amd64 systems so far have in practice had (IIRC) 48-bit address spaces, but the pointers are still 64 bits wide, as of course are all the general-purpose registers.
[21:53:25] <oldlaptop> There has also been a trend (the wisdom of which is debatable) towards wider and wider vectors in general-purpose CPUs, with many of intel's products now supporting 512-bit-wide vectors.
[21:53:58] <Thedarkb-Desktop> You can use the upper bits of the pointer as a reference count but I believe that gets the UB police on your arse.
[21:54:13] <oldlaptop> A 512-bit address word would be pretty silly, but then again classifying ISAs by "bitness" is faintly silly to begin with.
[21:54:25] <oldlaptop> Thedarkb-Desktop: I don't think it's even the upper bits, on amd64, ISTR it's in the middle
[21:54:37] <Guest91> i just wanna build an 8 bit pc and be done with it
[21:54:48] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Huh, didn't realise that.
[21:54:50] <oldlaptop> it's definitely different on different hardware platforms, you don't know what weird things the OS is doing with the "extra" bits in your pointers, etc etc etc
