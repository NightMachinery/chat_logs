[05:09:27] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM that is a big mess
[05:09:40] <JohnDoe2> do you need all those 300 capture groups?
[05:10:09] <ChrisM> Maybe not all of them but many of them atleast all the ones I am using in my substitutuion
[05:10:27] *** Quits: ahmedelgabri (~ahmedelga@2a02-a446-d88a-1-b06d-8a8a-9061-5aaa.fixed6.kpn.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:10:42] <JohnDoe2> 100% not all of them because you don't use $3 for example, or $7,8,10,11,12,13 ... and so on
[05:11:21] <JohnDoe2> also let's use named capture groups because that is insane
[05:12:12] <ChrisM> Yeah clean it up as much as you want, I don't really know what I am doing when writing regex and just strumble through it until I get the result I want
[05:12:55] <JohnDoe2> mkay
[05:13:09] <ChrisM> Thanks
[05:16:14] <JohnDoe2> yeah that's ... hard to keep track of you'll have to help out a bit with the replacement string
[05:16:25] <ChrisM> k
[05:16:31] <JohnDoe2> now for the last thing you want it to do
[05:16:39] <JohnDoe2> can you paste the spot in the string that is described?
[05:16:48] <JohnDoe2> is it (Self) inside  [...] ?
[05:17:29] <ChrisM>         var abilityTwoLeechRolesCombined = ["Leech (Self)üíØ"];
[05:17:54] <JohnDoe2> so Self becomes Self Passive) ?
[05:18:07] <ChrisM> Yes
[05:18:12] <JohnDoe2> alrighty
[05:18:36] <ChrisM> But I need to also work when there in nothing in parencesis like this....
[05:18:38] <ChrisM>       var abilityFourFearRolesCombined = ["FearüíØ"];
[05:19:02] <ChrisM> In that case I want it to be Fear (Passive)
[05:19:20] <ChrisM> with the 100 after still but I should already account for that
[05:19:54] <JohnDoe2> meaning you'd run different replacements based on where you want Passive to end up?
[05:20:07] <JohnDoe2> Or are we basing it on the existence of some specific part in the string?
[05:20:32] <ChrisM> Based on the existence of something in parencesis inside the [""]
[05:20:50] <JohnDoe2> "<ChrisM> But I need to also work when there in nothing in parencesis like this...."
[05:20:57] <JohnDoe2> that is contradicting what you said
[05:21:22] <JohnDoe2> so what's the bottom line? If there's something in parentheses, then append Passive otherwise no/
[05:21:50] <JohnDoe2> If that's not a rule you can apply I'm afraid you'll have to run different replacements manually based on which one you want at the time
[05:22:51] <JohnDoe2> then what's the deal with the üíØ ? Is that always there? Or is the bunch of (üíØ|) you use for times when it does not exist?
[05:22:51] <ChrisM> If something in parentheses add Passive inside of it...   If nothing in parentheses, add parentheses with Passive inside them
[05:23:11] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM can you show me what the looks like? "add parentheses with passive inside them"
[05:23:19] <ChrisM> Exactly, that is for the time when it does not exist
[05:23:35] <JohnDoe2> so üíØ is optional. What else could be in its place other than nothing?
[05:23:41] <ChrisM> (Passive)
[05:23:46] <JohnDoe2> üëç
[05:23:58] <ChrisM> or (Self Passive) if it already had (Self)
[05:24:05] <JohnDoe2> perfect thank you

[05:24:16] <ChrisM> (y) 
[05:26:00] <JohnDoe2> so üíØ - what else can take its place?
[05:26:14] <ChrisM> Any Self should be able to be anything
[05:26:29] <JohnDoe2> got it, we just capture what's there and move it in the replacement
[05:26:50] <ChrisM> So there will either be a üíØ or there will be nothing

[06:55:00] <JohnDoe2> can we backport that into /10 because I'm not going back to numbers

[07:57:35] <JohnDoe2> http://s1.softaculous.com/a/ampps/files/Ampps-3.9-x86_64-setup.exe
[07:57:55] <ChrisM> Yeah the tab instantly disapears 
[07:58:03] <ChrisM> WTF is blocking it
[07:58:11] <JohnDoe2> powershell: wget <url>
[07:58:17] <JohnDoe2> I think they emulate it somehow
[07:58:59] <ChrisM> Seems to be working like that
[07:59:33] <digitok> downloads fine here
[08:00:12] <digitok> by chrome's security stuff i assume you mean safe browsing
[08:00:20] <digitok> set to no protection
[08:02:07] <digitok> also ChrisM, did you see my /x version :>
[08:02:36] <ChrisM> Doesn't seem to be where it said it downloaded it to... https://i.imgur.com/s4i4aqw.png
[08:03:31] <JohnDoe2> in your user folder directly
[08:03:39] <ChrisM> Wasn't it the same thing that John gave me except with line breaks to space everything out?
[08:03:58] <digitok> yep
[08:04:00] <JohnDoe2> you can probably type Ampps and tab in the same window to find it
[08:04:25] <digitok> just didn't know if you seen it since you didn't say thanks digitok that's super awesome
[08:04:33] <ChrisM> It did it is not there
[08:04:43] <ChrisM> Must of been removed as soon as it was downloaded

[08:09:13] <ChrisM> You going to be here a bit, I need a break lol
[08:21:01] <ChrisM> Just tell what what I would do if I had PHP installed and I will figure that part out later
[08:31:14] <digitok> even php won't do the inline pcre2 conditional replacement you're using
[08:31:32] <digitok> you'd need to use a callback
[08:32:07] <digitok> i'm sure vscode can do callbacks, so just do it there
[08:34:26] <ChrisM> How do I do that?

[08:51:24] <digitok> 07JohnDoe2, confused about?
[08:51:31] <digitok> he's using a conditional replacement. it won't work in php
[08:51:36] <ChrisM> I know how to use VScode and I am pretty advanced with the search replace regex but I have never heard of callbacks or could find anything relevent when I googled it
[08:52:10] <JohnDoe2> digitok no, that was just me pulling your leg about line numbers
[08:52:25] <digitok> i see
[08:52:36] <JohnDoe2> any scripting language can do conditional replacements 
[08:52:41] <digitok> 07ChrisM, well, if it's literally a find/replace gui, then you probably can't
[08:52:49] <digitok> it needs to be coded
[08:53:08] <JohnDoe2> right, and I tried perl but realized it's a bit of a clusterhump 
[08:53:09] <digitok> 07JohnDoe2, correct

[08:53:23] <JohnDoe2> UTF8 and all üíØ
[08:53:30] <digitok> isn't vscode js or something?
[08:53:38] <VectorX> digitok something new, did you get a hair cut perhaps? the nicks your mention seem to have colour
[08:53:39] <digitok> you can't make a script to do it?
[08:53:41] <JohnDoe2> it's an IDE built on top of a browser
[08:53:55] <digitok> yes, using what scripting language
[08:53:58] <digitok> js?
[08:54:00] <ChrisM> If I knew what I was doing, sure.
[08:54:17] <JohnDoe2> mostly, but its regex engine is most likely .NET given that it's microsucks software
[08:54:30] <digitok> someone said it uses rust pcre2
[08:54:44] <JohnDoe2> I never actually checked to be honest
[08:55:13] <JohnDoe2> anyway back to php let me get a quick preg replace with a callback going
[08:55:32] <digitok> lol

[08:57:41] <digitok> weird way to write a preg replace
[08:58:13] <ChrisM> So I found XAMPP which I already had installed
[08:58:18] <ChrisM> Will that work?
[08:58:26] <JohnDoe2> digitok so <digitok> it needs to be coded --- did you have something specific in mind? or just hate php generally speaking
[08:58:41] <digitok> i like php
[08:58:43] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM yeah any php is fine
[08:58:50] <ChrisM> K, now what lol
[08:59:01] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM find out where the folder is, and cd to it in command prompt
[08:59:05] <digitok> i was just saying that if he's using the regex in a gui, it's unlikely he can do a callback
[08:59:13] <digitok> it needs to be code/script
[08:59:32] <ChrisM> The folder with what I want to run the replacement on?
[08:59:41] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM hold on I'm regex replacing the regex replacement to get it as a regex replacement callback return
[08:59:46] <digitok> lol
[09:00:07] <ChrisM> That is a lot of regex replacements
[09:00:10] <JohnDoe2> ChrisM type php --version and see if you get anything back in command prompt
[09:00:14] <JohnDoe2> yes because I'm lazy

[09:02:24] <JohnDoe2> ok so ChrisM where should php write the file?
[09:02:35] <JohnDoe2> should it simply overwrite it?
[09:02:39] <digitok> in the folder
[09:02:52] <JohnDoe2> what about the directory?
[09:02:55] <ChrisM> Oh yeah I have used that before to create javascript regex substitutions but I need to actually change the code not run a conversion within it
[09:02:58] <digitok> nah, won't work
[09:03:08] <JohnDoe2> dammit
[09:03:43] <ChrisM> I am cool with it overwriting it but would be better to make a copy of it
[09:03:59] <ChrisM> If it overwrites it, I will just make a copy first 
[09:04:17] <JohnDoe2> well the idea is that you have to call php script.php myfile.txt
[09:04:31] <JohnDoe2> so that implies that you would need to copy script.php in the folder where myfile.txt is
[09:04:57] <ChrisM> Okay, so in that case I would already have made a copy of it
[09:05:19] <ChrisM> I will just create a directory to hold both those files
[09:05:36] <JohnDoe2> right, or copy the file over to where script.php is, or pass a full path to the file to be changed.
[09:05:38] <JohnDoe2> ayt then
[09:06:11] <ChrisM> Yeah I like the first option of just a directory to run the conversion within
[09:07:20] <JohnDoe2> so add (Passive) when no () inside [] otherwise add Passive to ( Self ) if inside [] --- ya?
[09:08:44] <ChrisM> (Passive) when no () inside [] otherwise add Passive to ( Self ) if inside []

This would have to be automated a lot of times (for example in program code, I would rewrite the names of the functions first, then the parameters according to a given schema, and do this in several texts in the same
[14:59:29] <re101-fly-97> way). Do you think there is any solution to this?
[15:10:36] <digitok> not within re101, no, but it's something i've also thought would be a cool feature. just not sure how it could be done cleanly
[15:11:16] <digitok> you'd probably just need to write a script to do it

[15:22:58] <re101-swan-63> Hi, I want to capture a color from a string. The color may be mixed with characters, periods, hyphen, underscores. And the color will always between two strings. First one is for category, second is "FB". I just want to capture the color code in between:

[15:24:54] <re101-swan-63> That fast. oh

[15:25:13] <digitok> non-space character
[15:25:34] <re101-swan-63> thank you so much
[15:25:39] <digitok> yw :)
[15:26:34] <digitok> you probably don't even need the " FB" in the regex, unless there are other lines that would match without it which you don't want
