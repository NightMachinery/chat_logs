[01:30:02] <kevr> nvidia-settings is typically configured as a user, but when you run it, you're probably running it as a user and not root, and users can't write to /etc/X11/... by default. You can "Show Preview..." when you're saving the config, and compare what it shows there with what you have?

[01:43:11] <kevr> susi: If people stop supporting nvidia, then a lot of us with nvidia cards would not be able to use Linux. I find that to be a lot worse than trying to help with nvidia regardless of their bullshit.
[01:44:16] <ahill> I've had a total of two Nvidia cards and I was happier with the first one(GT 640) than the one I have now(GTX 1650). My next upgrade is likely to be an AMD card.
[01:44:47] <susi> kevr: I meant people with Linux shouldn't buy nVidia products :-)

[01:45:20] <grazzolini> kevr: Nvidia improved a lot
[01:45:29] <kevr> ahill: you probably just need to restart your X session. xorg doesn't hot reload it's config.
[01:45:30] <thrice> lol, you think linux users are going to make a dent with nvidia?
[01:45:45] <thrice> as kevr alluded, they'll just stop supporting it, which is the worse situation
[01:45:48] <ahill> kevr: I'm saying it doesn't stick after a reboot. It's perfectly fine as long as I don't power it off.
[01:46:28] <grazzolini> ahill: what doesn't stick?

[01:55:15] <kevr> I'm probably not explaining this well. ahill, I believe you originally were opening nvidia-settings as root, going to Display Configuration, then pressing 'Save to X Configuration File' and saving it to /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Correct?
[01:55:27] <ahill> Correct.
[01:56:03] <kevr> ahill: What I'm saying now is, do that as your normal user, not as root, and change the path from /etc/X11/xorg.conf to /home/<your_user>/xorg.conf, so that it actually saves your config from a user standpoint, and without merging into any older X config.

[02:06:01] <kevr> quite*

[03:28:44] <drew> in general, I should recognize every package in `pacman -Qe`, as those are the packages that my system is building a dependency graph around. I see in there basic packages that I would assume would be in core, like man-db or coreutils, though
[03:29:18] <drew> so I am assuming that arch installs some packages outside of core as well, right? or are these in core but they just show up in -Qe because I should explicitly want them

[03:33:20] <drew> right but then if I remove them and pacman doesn't complain, then I know that they weren't in base. If I try to uninstall and it says they are dependencies of base, then I can do pacman -D --asdeps foo

[05:44:18] <phrik> Title: WeeChat scripting guide (at weechat.org)
[05:44:58] <kevr> Yes, it is easy.
[05:46:06] <eom-dev> how does it handle stdin?
[05:46:19] <kevr> eom-dev: You should probably read the weechat scripting doc.
[05:46:33] <kevr> It doesn't directly work with stdin. It works with weechat buffers.
[05:48:42] <kevr> weechat uses stdin for input in particular ways. It must, in order to maintain its TUI properly.
[05:49:04] <kevr> But that's all done at the core level. Not much to do with scripts.
[05:49:37] <eom-dev> gotcha - i've been using ii, which just creates fifo pipes that I can interface with directly in bash.
[05:50:20] <kevr> What exactly are you trying to make?

[05:52:18] <eom-dev> In short, my irc client is compatable with my 3d printer.
[05:52:48] <eom-dev> If I wanted, I could set up a pipe from this channels output to my 3d printer's input, allowing you guys to control my printer by sending gcode commands.

[06:59:14] <orangeFlu> mpan: well it isn't so much an error, as it doesn't do anything. I checked the logs, no error is being reported. If I use the CLI, I try to log in, and it says I logged in sucessfuly, but otherwise doesn't let me do anything because "no session was found. please login first". Seems like something similar is happening to the gui client, as right after pressing the login button, it just stays

[07:35:40] <herjazz> maybe relevant

[07:36:36] <sheep> openssh 7.2 and later can still use ssh-rsa but with the newer hashes
[07:36:37] <herjazz> this would also affect other rolling release distros like Void I'm guessing?

[19:09:52] <ectospasm> So, OOM killer killed a bunch of processes on my Arch router earlier this week, including dhcpd, firewalld, and named, the three services that really make up my router.  Unfortunately I didn't have proper logging set up so I don't know what really caused it.  I've installed sysstat and started the requisite systemd timers, if it happens again I hope to be able to figure out what it was.
[19:10:36] <NetSysFire> you should check out the OOM directives in systemd.directives(7)
[19:11:13] <ectospasm> NetSysFire: Ah, so I can prevent certain services from being killed by OOM?

[19:31:03] <mpan> ectospasm: also setup a mechanism for setting system back to operational state. While some of those services might have been collateral, it is not unlikely that one of them is the actual culprit and OOM killer should indeed kill them. The service should be rebooted afterwards.

[19:41:32] <ectospasm> And the first thing it killed was named.
[19:41:44] <MacGyver> Well, dhcpd probably *triggered* it when it tried to allocate memory.
[19:42:16] <MacGyver> But none of the essential processes use so much memory in normal operation you'd expect this to be an issue.

[21:27:31] <MrElendig> the actual implementation (the wm/de) matters
[21:27:47] <MrElendig> some of it is because wayland is better, some of it is placebo
[21:28:21] <arjun> shame, i do prefer xfce. But gnome just runs SO much smoother that i can't ignore it : P
[21:29:42] <orangeFlu> so no idea on the kdewallet problem?
[21:30:24] <MrElendig> orangeFlu: kdewallet is irrelevant, the way you are starting the client simply doesn't preserve that env var

[21:31:48] *** Quits: arjun (~user@user/arjun) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:32:26] <orangeFlu> Well, it's pretty obvious what it does, no? It needs root access, and since I run it as normal user, it can't modify interfaces
[21:32:53] <orangeFlu> And instead of asking for root, it jprobably just gets into some infinite loop
[21:33:04] <MrElendig> there are capabilities etc that could perhaps be used instead
[21:33:36] <orangeFlu> It may also have something to do with the fact that I don't have sudo on my machine
[21:33:40] <orangeFlu> I use doas

[23:27:49] <topcat_001> bloodfart69: Do you get that issue with another DE?
[23:27:59] *** Quits: export (~export@user/export) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[23:28:39] <topcat_001> One diagnostic I often try is switch to a simple WM like twm and see if it happens.
[23:28:51] <thrice> I wonder if you could use xfconf-query, or xfce's tool, to see if it's the same before/after ?
[23:29:05] *** Joins: martin02 (~silas@141.84.69.76)
[23:29:08] <thrice> for the "slowness," you'll have to check a process monitor to see what's using cpu

[23:30:25] <bloodfart69> It shouldn't be using anything actually. It is a 4.00GHZ intel unlocked cpu
[23:31:22] <thrice> sure, but you should confirm that

[23:33:24] <bloodfart69> I can do that. But right now, it is working cause I turned off the display power management. 
[23:33:36] <topcat_001> Is it just a bad screensaver?

[23:38:50] <bloodfart69> The screensaver is default. So, I don't think it can be that. Also, I don't run anything heavy at the start, I literally log in and walk away, and I'm stuck with a mouse wallpaper and everything is slow.I mean, I do have two DVI-HDMI, two hdmi's go from those adapters to another adapter, which has two female hdmi ports that connect to my monitor

[23:40:00] <thrice> without clues, such as inspecting the process list, it's pretty tough to guess
[23:40:54] <thrice> I'd try removing the screensaver or something from the equation, and just blank the screen
