[01:14:27] <emanuele6> i was expecting awk print an error message that says that file '' does not exist

[01:53:22] <nmz> emanuele6: file is empty, therefore you are doing awk 'arg'
[01:53:27] <nmz> no arguments
[01:53:41] <nmz> when awk doesn't have file arguments, it reads from stdin
[01:53:49] <emanuele6> ah
[01:53:56] <nmz> hence why {seq 10 | awk '/5/'} works
[01:54:03] <nmz> because no file arguments
[01:54:28] <emanuele6> no, but I'm passing an empty string as an argument here

[01:59:21] <emanuele6> i'm just saying that the argument is passed
[01:59:33] <emanuele6> it is not omitted
[01:59:36] <nmz> do you want awk to read from a file called 0x00?

[02:05:30] <emanuele6> what you are saying makes no sense
[02:05:43] <emanuele6> you can pass an empty string to any program

[02:06:56] <nmz> what is an empty string?
[02:08:28] <emanuele6> nmz: in the context of program arguments, in unix systems, it is an empty C string: a pointer to a region of 8bit memory that contains 0
[02:09:01] <nmz> # printf '%c' "" | hexdump -c
[02:09:02] <shbot> nmz: bash: hexdump: command not found

[02:12:22] <emanuele6> so, is there a way to tell to use an argument as the input file safely?
[02:12:58] <emanuele6> an option that tells it to use the following argument as the file argument or maybe a variable i can set to the path to the input file?

[02:26:22] <nmz> if you ask me, unix really messed up with files, the fact that you can have any character except for / is just wrong
