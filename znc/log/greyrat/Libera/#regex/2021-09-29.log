[07:00:08] <maroon> that was one of the examples i asked him in /2, whether it should match 3 or 1 words, or when something followed the "string"
[07:01:10] <jargon> Roe is a computer assisted card game, like how Pokemon works, except Roe was from 1997.
[07:02:25] <maroon> so the match always has 2 words inside quotes never more/less?
[07:02:37] <maroon> or can be 1 word?
[07:04:35] <jargon> It is supposed to follow PHP's ucwords() rules.
[07:04:55] <purplex> Intentionally ignoring our question, can't help sorry.
[07:05:02] <jargon> It is supposed to be between 1 and 3 words.
[07:05:38] <jargon> no longer than 18 chars tho
[07:05:43] <purplex> So, are you interested in 3 words? if not then https://regex101.com/r/cR9o9Z/4
[07:05:56] <maroon> so it should not match a string having 4 words, or a string which has a space preceding the final quote?
[07:06:07] <jargon> yes.

[07:07:20] <jargon> The game is supposed to have 1 to 3 word for card name, no more than 18 character, yes
[07:07:48] <purplex> 18 per word, or either thing including space?
[07:07:50] <jargon> If it is more than 18 characters it needs to generate a short code.
[07:08:01] <maroon> so the part inside the quotes would be Word followed by 0/1/2 of \sWord

[07:11:32] <jargon> Is there a way to embed a php function that performs a replacement in such a case?

[07:21:46] <jargon> I still would like to be able to throttle the char length as neccessary.
[07:22:27] <maroon> according to google, the most consecutive consonants in a word is 6
[07:23:23] <jargon> the shortcode routine I made has no problem parsing 6 consonants in a row.
[07:23:48] <maroon> i was just saying that human readible would probably exclude 7+
[07:24:13] <jargon> How about: Human differentiable.
[07:24:48] <maroon> for [A-Z]{1} the {1} is redundant
[07:26:05] <maroon> and cannot be a 1 letter word like E Pluribus Unum ?
[07:29:05] <jargon> Sure, of course it can 
[07:29:27] <jargon> Just no more than 2 spaces.
[07:29:32] <jargon> 3 word max

[07:36:34] <jargon> The regex is used to build the game, not play it
[07:37:55] <jargon> For example, PHP would create the FreeBASIC project source code as designed in a web based editor, and then the user would use a generated tool to compile it.
[07:40:25] <maroon> that link is a slight modification of your original regex, except it matches only the 1-3 words, and allows 1-letter words
[07:43:58] <jargon> Don't forget that it should only allow single spaces in a row
[07:45:14] <jargon> This doesn't capture all 3 words tho, only the final one: https://regex101.com/r/cR9o9Z/8
[07:46:38] <jargon> For example, the 4 letter shortcode for "Pokemon" is PKMN"
[07:47:08] <jargon> Which is heavily used throughout their game franchise.
[07:50:02] <jargon> Pokemon used to be named "Pocket Monsters" in Japan, but they changed the name due to  copyright conflict with an American figurine toyline by the same name.

[07:56:27] <jargon> This one works.
[07:56:59] <jargon> Doesn't even need backreferencing,
[07:57:51] <jargon> I can then pass the result to a remake of my short code generator per set of matches.

[07:59:35] <purplex> How are you ensuring it is 18 characters?
[08:00:19] <jargon> I will leave that up to the shortcode routine.
[08:00:58] <maroon> your last regex is more complicated than mine, are you needing to have the additional Dust grups?
[08:01:34] <purplex> Still seems complex than it needs to be.
[08:01:35] <jargon> Sleepy Dust and Dust Bunny are two different cards.
[08:02:01] <jargon> Cob Spider and Web Net are two different cards as well.
[08:02:29] <purplex> Can anyone enter the wrong names, is that why you are validating the case and such?
[08:02:34] <jargon> I also didn't put Palace Guard in the example code.
[08:02:45] <maroon> i mean mine had capture of Dust Bunny, yours had Dust Bunny, DUst, Dust
[08:03:26] <maroon> and yours had some unneccessary ( |stuff)
[08:03:26] <jargon> purplex, I am having PHP rip the game data out of the engine's source code so that like how SCUMVM works, I'd be able to use an alternate engine.
[08:03:36] <purplex> Sometimes people just like to validate for no good reason, I was wondering.
[08:04:01] <purplex> If names are already 'good' then I won't do that.
[08:04:35] <jargon> How do I just capture the name then without individual pieces? O_O
[08:04:39] <maroon> and sometimes people like to push the limits on what's allowed, im registered at a website that sends out public birthday greetings, so im registered using a birthday of feb 31st, and it never greets me
[08:05:03] <maroon> by looking at the last url i just pasted, using ?:

[15:21:38] <dogmydog> Hello everyone! 
[15:22:07] <dogmydog> Is it possible to embed the regex101 generator on my website with a button "generate"?
[15:22:31] <digitok> which regex101 generator would that be
[15:22:35] <digitok> code generator?
[15:22:57] <dogmydog> I have a simple regex expression
[15:23:06] <dogmydog> ^PI[0-9][2-6][a-g][0-9a-z][j-q]$
[15:23:22] <dogmydog> I want to put a page on my wordpress with a code to generate a random number
[15:23:29] <dogmydog> and display it to the user
[15:24:13] <digitok> and what do you want regex101 to do
[15:24:19] <digitok> seems unrelated
[15:24:53] <dogmydog> I don't know if I can input a code directly on the html
[15:25:23] <dogmydog> I have tested my expression on regex101
[15:25:27] <dogmydog> and it works!

[15:27:05] <digitok> 07dogmydog, cool, but i don't really know what you want
[15:28:34] <dogmydog> I'm just looking for a way to generate tokens based on a simple regex on my wordpress page. Like this: https://onlinestringtools.com/generate-string-from-regex
