[01:40:32] <Tenacious-Techhu> O.K., so, I have a regex that checks a WHOLE FILE as its only capture group, with multiple new lines in it, and so on, and verifies the file is the right format. But every bash command I can find to check the file against the regex seems to assume that match checking ENDS at new lines, so they all seem to crap out. Is there a command I can use that
[01:40:33] <Tenacious-Techhu> will FULLY respect the PCRE regex I give it, new line requirements for matching against the one capture group included?
[01:41:33] <lopid> perl -0777 …?
[01:41:52] <lopid> it's not pcre, but it should do

[01:42:24] <larryv> not many standard tools can even recognize PCRE
[01:43:11] <lopid> pcretest/pcre2test
[01:43:24] <Tenacious-Techhu> It's so disappointing; grep says it recognizes PCRE, but then you feed it PCRE with newlines in it, and it shits the bed.
[01:43:35] <lopid> grep is newline based
[01:43:49] <lopid> pcregrep too, probably
[01:43:52] <neshpion> IIRC grep has a flag you have to give it if you want to do newlines
[01:44:32] <lopid> but then, you'd be "resorting to" grep
[01:45:32] <Tenacious-Techhu> I think I'm at a point where I care more whether the tool does the job correctly than whether it was the right tool for the job to begin with.
[01:45:34] <lopid> pcre2grep at least has -M
[01:45:53] <greycat> when you're using nonstandard regex languages and nonstandard options that change the way records are processed, you're no longer using grep
[01:46:26] <Tenacious-Techhu> I think that's more for capturing on multiple lines than one capture across multiple lines.
[01:46:55] <Tenacious-Techhu> But I AM using standard regex.
[01:47:09] <neshpion> hmm i can't find it

[01:48:24] <Tenacious-Techhu> I'm not really looking to capture the content, just confirm the content matches the regex; I mentioned the capture group just to be clear that I'm trying to capture the ENTIRE FILE, not some small subset of it, and not some small subset of just one line, like grep seems built for.
[01:48:47] <Tenacious-Techhu> Or, rather, limited to.
[01:48:58] <larryv> *designed for
[01:49:07] <larryv> PCRE is not considered standard around here.
[01:49:10] <greycat> "built for" is also accurate
[01:49:11] <lopid> it sounds like you're not actually using a capture group, then. a capture group is a real regex thing, not just a phrase for "matching everything"
[01:49:48] <Tenacious-Techhu> Well, you can't have a match without a capture group, I think.
[01:50:11] <lopid> i'd wager most regexes in use today don't use capture groups
[01:50:47] <greycat> 1) do you actually *need* PCRE features?  2) can you simply replace all the newlines with something like $'\005' and do your match on the whole file that way?
[01:51:34] <kurahaupo> Tenacious-Techhu: Your first error is assuming that "regex" and "pcre" are synonymous; pcre is merely one of (at least) 4 dialects of regex
[01:51:52] <Tenacious-Techhu> I'm testing files to see if they match a certain format; as newlines are included IN that format in certain places, then, YEAH, I need to test for newlines.

[01:56:13] <greycat> if they're not, then perl is a very good suggestion
[01:56:18] <Tenacious-Techhu> The format is NOT my choice. I'm just trying to confirm that files MATCH it.
[01:56:59] <greycat> What I'm hearing is "I don't know what regex language it's written in, I didn't write it, I don't understand it, and I cannot even imagine converting it to ERE" -- so the answer to the first question disqualifies grep.  Go use perl.
[01:57:03] <kurahaupo> There's a reason they're called Perl Compatible Regular Expressions…
[01:57:28] <kurahaupo> Tenacious-Techhu: Do you mean that someone else is providing the regex?

[01:59:07] <Tenacious-Techhu> I built a regex that matches the required format to my satisfaction.
[01:59:21] <kurahaupo> btw PCRE has some fairly extreme performance issues. Typical implementations  are orders of magnitude slower than typical BRE and ERE implementations
[01:59:23] <Tenacious-Techhu> The issue is finding a bash command that respects that regex properly.
[01:59:38] <lopid> a shell command

[02:00:20] <kurahaupo> Tenacious-Techhu: There are no standard POSIX commands that must include any recognition of PCRE
[02:00:51] <kurahaupo> Tenacious-Techhu: Therefore a non-POSIX command such as Perl is a reasonable answer
[02:00:55] <Tenacious-Techhu> grep, for instance, has a PCRE compatibility option, but it's ignoring the newlines for no apparent reason.

[02:01:14] <greycat> Anyway, you seem to be ignoring my two questions, so I'm done.
[02:01:32] <kurahaupo> grep is intended to treat lines as records, and to report on records, even when in non standard PCRE mode
[02:01:33] <Tenacious-Techhu> If I haven't answered them, I missed them.
[02:01:53] <kurahaupo> Tenacious-Techhu: have you tried grep -Po?
[02:02:11] <greycat> they'd still have to convert the newlines to some other delimiter in order to use grep
[02:02:17] <Tenacious-Techhu> I tried -P; I don't recall trying -o.
[02:02:25] <neshpion> pcregrep or ripgrep have a multiline option
[02:02:31] <neshpion> i don't think grep -o will do what you want
[02:02:42] <kurahaupo> Have you tried it?
[02:02:48] <lopid> might still be marked experimental, even
[02:02:53] <kurahaupo> true
[02:03:21] <Tenacious-Techhu> I believe I already said that I tried -P, and that I didn't recall trying -o; neshpion seems to think -o is a red herring.
[02:03:52] <kurahaupo> neshpion: given that it reports multiple matches within a line, it's reasonable to assume that it completely ignores line boundaries
[02:04:06] <neshpion> grep -o says it will "print only the matching part of a matching line", which doesn't sound like enabling matching a single pattern against multiline input to me

[02:22:35] <neshpion> Tenacious-Techhu: popping perl into a bash script is as normal as sed, awk, and jq; those are actually scripting languages too.  the invocation and options afforded to the user allow it to fit seamlessly into a shell script like any other *NIX command.  so yeah, technically '/^pattern$/ && print "Matching"' is a "script" in the sense that the argument to `sed 's/a/b/g'` is a "script" but it's not
[02:22:37] <neshpion> terribly illegible to someone who can already read shell.
[02:23:52] <Tenacious-Techhu> I'll definitely keep that in consideration if I'm otherwise forced to resort to it.

[02:29:30] *** Joins: shabius (~shabius@45.15.19.231)
[02:30:35] <Tenacious-Techhu> The ultimate goal is to feed a script a list of files at directories output by clamav that I no longer want to be bothered about because they're false positives. So, the useful bit is to take those files, get their MD5 checksum and file size, and write them out to the sigfile.fo file in the required directory.
[02:30:52] <kurahaupo> Tenacious-Techhu: Your issue with grep and similar tools was that they read records and checks each one in turn; that's its purpose. By default "record" equals "line", but that can be changed
[02:31:05] <Tenacious-Techhu> Of course, before doing that, the reasonable thing to do is to make sure that both sigfile.fo and the input file are of the correct formats.
[02:32:18] <kurahaupo> If you only ever append new md5sums to the file, why should it ever have an invalid format?
[02:32:25] <Tenacious-Techhu> If there's a way to treat the entire file as a record, and regex across the entire file at once, that would be good; on the other hand, if it's such an odd use of grep and so on that no one knows it can actually do that, then that might make it difficult to read.

[02:38:56] <kurahaupo> (Posix text handling utilities are not required to be graceful when handed something that's not a valid POSIX text file - say, if it doesn't end with a newline - and a common behaviour is simply to ignore any bytes after the last newline in a file.

[14:13:58] <_rgn> yes
[14:14:00] <ormaaj> I wonder if anybody has  ever had to put files into an array while piping with some kind of loop. Maybe they even wrote about it somewhere.
[14:14:34] <Soliton> sounds like you'll need some dynamic code generation nonsense.
[14:15:04] <Soliton> seems like a terrible api.
[14:15:31] <_rgn> if it's not feasible in bash i won't do it. just wondering if it was possible 
[14:16:27] <ormaaj> the space between possible and feasible is quite large
[14:16:32] <Soliton> anything is possible... but a pipeline is code if you do not know how the pipeline looks it means you need to dynamically generate code and eval it.
[14:17:56] <ormaaj> doesn't necessarily need to be eval'd
[14:18:26] <Soliton> well, or write out all possible pipes.
[14:19:10] <Soliton> if there is only going to be up to 10 files or something you could do that i guess.

[23:38:19] <eggbean> I am using echo in a for loop to test what it is doing, but the variables are not expanding? `echo "rm ~/.config/$c"`
[23:38:46] <greycat> $c is inside double quotes, so it will expand
[23:39:06] <greycat> it's also unquoted, so you get word splitting, which is potentially very bad
[23:39:20] <greycat> I mean, once you remove the echo and the double quotes, the rm command...
[23:39:32] <eggbean> What about the ~?
[23:39:34] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)
[23:39:39] <greycat> hopefully your actual rm command is rm ~/.config/"$c"

[23:44:07] <twkm> ~[user] must not be quoted if you want it to expand to the user's home directory, yet $c should be quoted to avoid splitting, thus greycat's suggestion.
[23:46:07] <twkm> (if followed by a / that too must remain unquoted, so ~ ~/ ~/"$var")

[23:47:47] <greycat> I'm guessing the actual issue was the tilde wasn't expanding, not that variables weren't.
