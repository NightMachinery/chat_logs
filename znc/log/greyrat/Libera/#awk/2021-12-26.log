[17:57:17] <regexfreak> does awk support "look arounds" i.e (?=X) etc
[18:03:37] <lopid> no
[18:19:03] <emanuele6> regexfreak: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_04
[18:19:15] <emanuele6> awk uses extended regular expressions
[18:32:12] <nmz1> you often think you need em, but you don't

[20:54:02] <e36freak> seems like a common question lately
[20:54:13] <e36freak> regexfreak: your name aside, regex isn't always the best way to do something
[20:54:19] <e36freak> golden hammer, yadda yadda yadda
[20:54:51] <e36freak> the more i learn, the less i tend to go for it
[20:55:55] <regexfreak> e36freak -Â =D =D
[20:56:28] <regexfreak> what are the other way then - the obvious question
[20:56:51] <e36freak> it depends on the actual problem you're trying to solve
[20:57:33] <e36freak> there is no "generic way to do look arounds", but there's a way to solve your problem without them
