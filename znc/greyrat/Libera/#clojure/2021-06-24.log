I wrote a web service with Clojure, It writes to the database (Postgres) and runs some complex and big queries on DB and generates some reports. The actual work here are those SQL queries. Is it natural and sensible to do property testing to evaluate SQL queries?!

[22:05:44] <RedNifre_> Is there a function for squishing strings, like replacing multiple spaces with single spaces or something? Or should I use gsub with a regex?
[22:07:16] <jeaye> ,(doc clojure.string/replace)
[22:07:32] <jeaye> Oh, no bot in here, maybe?
[22:08:20] <DrBob> If it's just a single character (a space) then using 'loop' would likely be a pretty quick way to do it.
[22:08:49] <jeaye> user=> (clojure.string/replace "foo   bar     spam" #"\s+" " ")
[22:08:53] <jeaye> "foo bar spam"
[22:09:26] <jeaye> That's probably the easiest way, but not the fastest way. It's fast enough until the profiler says it isn't, though.
[22:09:44] <RedNifre_> no, it's more like "           bla                bla            " and I want to get that under 100 chars by first cleaning the spaces like "bla bla" or " bla bla " and then cutting off everything after the 100th character if necessary.
[22:10:09] <RedNifre_> yeah, looks good, I'll try that, thanks.
[22:10:23] <jeaye> For cutting off after the 100th char, just use subs for that.
[22:10:45] <jeaye> (subs "123456789" 0 3) => "123"
[22:15:14] <RedNifre_> Hmmmm, is there something like Ramda's if, which instead of being the usual Bool -> A -> A has the more stream friendly (A -> Bool) -> (A -> B) -> (A -> B) -> A ?
[22:16:10] <jeaye> Maybe you want cond->
[22:16:47] <jeaye> I likely don't understand your question well enough, though.
[22:17:03] <RedNifre_> Sort of like (->> some-string  (if2 greater-100 (partial clojure.string/replace _HOW_TO_DO_A_PARAMETER_PLACEHOLDER_ #"\s+" " ") identity-function)) ...
[22:17:26] <RedNifre_> hm, this currying and partial application stuff doesn't seem to fit clojure that well anyways.
[22:17:30] <RedNifre_> hang on...
[22:17:39] <jeaye> Look into cond->
[22:18:27] <jeaye> If you need arbitrary placement while threading, we have as->
[22:18:37] <RedNifre_> ok, will do. What I mean is this, where the "level" gets piped (similar to ->>) through some partially applied functions, especially the special if https://github.com/Michael-Zinn/fpsokobanjs/blob/master/game.js#L32
[22:19:41] <jeaye> RedNifre_: Note that no partial application is needed for what you're trying to do there.
[22:19:48] <jeaye> So that may be what's biting you.
[22:20:23] <RedNifre_> Couldn't I do #(< 100 %) for the condition?
[22:20:41] <jeaye> That's a function, not a bool.
[22:21:02] <RedNifre_> hmmmm
[22:21:26] <jeaye> Maybe we need a more concrete example?
[22:21:45] <RedNifre_> hang on, I'll try it with bools, one sec...
[22:23:26] <jeaye> (as-> "foo" $ (if (< 1 2) (str $ " bar") $)) => "foo bar"
[22:23:53] <jeaye> Remember that ->, ->>, as->, etc are macros, not fns. So we don't need to partially apply things to work with them.
[22:24:05] <jeaye> They're just sugar.
[22:24:44] <RedNifre_> (cond-> text
[22:24:47] <RedNifre_>   (< 100 (size text)) #(clojure.string/replace % #"\s+" " ")
[22:24:49] <RedNifre_>   (< 100 dammit!    ) #(subs % 0 100))
[22:25:05] <RedNifre_> okay, so I first want to reduce the whitespace and if it's still too long after that, I want to trim it to 100
[22:25:26] <RedNifre_> but I guess cond-> just terminates after the first line anyways.
[22:25:45] <jeaye> cond-> goes through _all_ conditions.
[22:26:00] <jeaye> But you're still using fns where you don't need them.
[22:26:25] <RedNifre_> ok, so how would I do "if it's too long, trim the spaces and if the result of that is still too long, cap it at 100"?
[22:27:16] <technomancy> I really hate the naming of some of these
[22:27:35] <technomancy> cond-> does NOT make me think "runs every condition"
[22:27:45] <RedNifre_> (cond-> text
[22:27:48] <RedNifre_>   (< 100 (size text)) (clojure.string/replace #"\s+" " ")
[22:27:50] <RedNifre_>   (< 100 WHATWHAT   ) (subs 0 100))  
[22:28:02] <RedNifre_> So the problem is in line 3, where I don't have a reference of the result of line 2 I think?
[22:28:31] <RedNifre_> ...and I mean count instead of size I guess.
[22:28:43] <jeaye> https://dpaste.com/AFZCV9CB8
[22:28:47] <jeaye> Easy way is this.
[22:29:21] <jeaye> You could likely turn this into an as-> but I wouldn't think it's better that way.
[22:29:42] <jeaye> That's jut trying to be too clever.
[22:32:37] <RedNifre_> Yeah... I wrote a pseudo code version Ramda style and it doesn't look nicer https://dpaste.com/DAEMUGMKW
[22:32:43] <RedNifre_> So I'll go with your solution, thanks.
[22:34:22] <RedNifre_> But I kinda like the idea of some sort of pipeline that applies transforms only if the cond function matches. some sort of (cond->fn->
[22:36:03] *** Joins: learner-monad (~ehanneken@user/learner-monad)
[22:36:51] <RedNifre_> (fn->cond->
[22:36:54] <RedNifre_>   too-long? (clojure.string/replace #"\s+" " ")
[22:36:56] <RedNifre_>   too-long? (subs 0 100))
[22:37:02] <RedNifre_> oh well, maybe another day
[22:51:50] *** Joins: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[22:58:46] <jeaye> Certainly something you could cook up yourself, just using pairs of predicates and transformations
[22:59:10] <Para> cond-> should be more like yield->, even though that's probably confusing for the functional purists, then
[22:59:39] <jeaye> Partition the args into groups of 2, then reduce over them and apply the transformation if the predicate is truthy.
[22:59:52] <jeaye> Should be ~5-6 lines of code for that fn.
[23:00:09] <ToxicFrog> yield-> I'd expect to be something related to coroutines
[23:00:28] <jeaye> Yeah, yield is too async-related these days.
[23:01:06] <jeaye> I think when-> makes sense.
[23:03:26] <ToxicFrog> """these days"""
[23:03:32] <ToxicFrog> Oh I like when->

[23:36:06] <Para> Oh great, now I'm thinking of yet another trollish arrow library potentials.
[23:36:24] <Para> It'd be just a few dozen aliases for cond-> but using all kinds of misinformed words.
[23:41:02] <ToxicFrog> sometimes->
