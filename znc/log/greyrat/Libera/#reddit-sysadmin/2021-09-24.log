[05:53:33] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, that guy was me at my current job, but I did actually start making good changes :D
[05:54:15] <Cl0udNinja> my boss called me a cowboy or made snide-ish remarks about my cowboy-ish behavior for the first few months, but started to realize I actually had cause for the things I was suggesting/mentioning
[05:55:55] <xe0n> sure, but it's how you approach people with those things that get the cowboy and snide-ish remarks
[05:56:08] <xe0n> if you want to implement changes, need to explain it in a way everyone understands and can come to an agreement
[05:56:40] <xe0n> and be realisitic about things
[05:57:15] <Cl0udNinja> yeah. truthfully, until this job, I was 'the guy' at every other place, if an answer didnt exist within the company, I either had to find one or come up with one. coming to a company thats got a whole team of people, was pretty difficult for me to break that habit
[05:57:31] <xe0n> yup
[05:57:54] <catbeard> yeah you don't want to be "the guy" or at least if you are, document very VERY well, so someone else can dread pirate roberts you when you get hit by a bus
[05:58:03] <xe0n> yup
[05:58:30] <Cl0udNinja> you know damn well I never got time to document anything being the lone ranger at those places :P
[05:58:39] <catbeard> you need lackies
[05:58:51] <xe0n> tsk tsk
[05:58:53] <xe0n> thats on you lol
[05:58:57] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, I never could get them to approve that shit
[05:59:03] <xe0n> dont blame work on not documenting, you should be learning how to document and work at the same time
[05:59:06] <catbeard> so hire some VA's out of pocket
[05:59:11] <xe0n> haha
[05:59:22] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, nah, not my fault they wouldnt give me time. "hey we need this major project that youve never head of until today completed next week"
[05:59:35] <xe0n> yep and part of the project work is documenting
[05:59:37] <Cl0udNinja> and then before that date is even arrived, I've been given 4 other projects
[05:59:37] <xe0n> document as you go
[05:59:45] <xe0n> that way documentation is always done and is included as part of the work
[05:59:48] <xe0n> how i tend to do things :)
[06:01:43] <catbeard> i usually set aside about 20 minutes after work just to go back and document shit i worked on each day
[06:02:11] <catbeard> even though i try to document while i go
[06:02:17] <catbeard> just to make sure it IS documented
[06:02:23] <xe0n> yep
[06:02:28] <xe0n> document as you go :)
[06:02:35] <xe0n> isnt that why we have multiple monitors? haha
[06:02:44] * catbeard laughs in wayfire
[06:05:24] <catbeard> actually i think GNOME is better feature-wise, though only 4 workspace limits presently, but no need for multiple monitors, just 1 YUUUUUGE TV
[06:08:23] <xe0n> whatever works :)
[06:09:48] <catbeard> better defaults i think
[06:10:03] <catbeard> and shit like 'always on top' works
[06:10:57] <JollyRgrs> that's what she said
[06:11:17] <xe0n> ++
[06:11:32] <catbeard> xe0n: btw, installing VirtuaWin gives you the Ctrl+Alt+arrowkey for switching windows desktops and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+arrowkey for workspace moving 
[06:11:56] <xe0n> i already switch virtual desktops :)
[06:12:39] <catbeard> them window rules though
[06:12:43] <catbeard> something else
[06:12:53] <catbeard> but wayfire gives me 9 workspaces 3x3
[06:13:58] <xe0n> okay
[06:14:01] <catbeard> gnome gives me 4 workspaces just 4 across, can actually be dynamic or static so it grows and shrinks
[06:14:43] <catbeard> but e.g. clicking on a link in another app in another workspace doesn't switch the workspace back to my open browser's workspace to steal focus
[06:14:55] <catbeard> on wayfire, but it does on GNOME

[10:36:38] <csws> lol
[10:37:10] <A-KO> good
[10:37:11] <A-KO> about time
[10:37:25] <csws> March 2022 Update: After receiving strong feedback from customers and with the emergence of COVID-21, we have decided to indefinitely defer disabling basic authentication
[10:37:29] <csws> that's what my crystal ball says
[10:40:55] <A-KO> meh, basic auth should have been gone
[10:41:00] <A-KO> now if only they could do that with on-premises
[10:41:03] <A-KO> but sadly, they won't
[10:41:08] <A-KO> at least not until likely Exchange vnext
[10:41:13] <A-KO> would have been nice to have a backport of that
[10:41:32] <Activ8> Who uses basic auth these days
[10:41:40] <A-KO> on-premises activesync still does :P
[10:41:43] <xe0n> plenty
[10:41:44] <xe0n> lol
[10:41:59] <A-KO> on-premises SMTP still does also
[10:42:06] <A-KO> although exchange online supports OAuth for SMTP now
[10:42:08] <csws> we've got services that only support IMAP :(
[10:42:12] <Activ8> Oh shoot
[10:42:14] <A-KO> yeah goodbye to those services
[10:42:37] <A-KO> imap and pop3 are basically going to be dead in Exchange Online unless they've updated them to support oauth
[10:42:48] <xe0n> i believe they are

[10:43:00] <A-KO> look at that
[10:43:03] <xe0n> yeah
[10:43:03] <xe0n> lol
[10:43:06] <A-KO> wow
[10:43:09] <A-KO> that's kind of impressive tbh
[10:43:15] <Activ8> We use Gmail SMTP to send payslips out in payroll manager they might need a new solution soon 
[10:43:23] <A-KO> gmail smtp supports oauth also
[10:43:27] <A-KO> I think google was the first tbh
[10:43:33] <csws> yeah
[10:43:43] <Activ8> well we don’t we use Xero I meant a company we deal with uses payroll manager still
[10:44:08] <Activ8> ah that’s fine, we must be using oauth to auth
[10:44:11] <csws> like it's good they hvae an answer for otherwise basic protocols like IMAP
[10:44:15] <Activ8> no need to change 😊
[10:44:20] <csws> but it'll be a headache trying to fit it into these shitty applications
[10:44:35] <Activ8> Maybe it’s time people moved on from shitty applications
[10:44:42] <Activ8> let the world get rid of them
[10:44:48] <xe0n> sure, if there's a replacement and an endless pit of money im sure companies would
[10:44:51] <Activ8> new solutions in order for anyone using them 
[10:44:54] <xe0n> but if there's no replacement, it makes it a bit hard
[10:44:59] <A-KO> what xe0n said
[10:45:13] <A-KO> you know how many thousands of applications out there will only ever support basic auth SMTP? lol
[10:45:16] <A-KO> like fuck
[10:45:17] <Activ8> yeh ofc but there’s always a solution to a problem
[10:45:19] <csws> we got a new major version for our EDRMS and it's still IMAP only :'''(
[10:45:37] <csws> in my perfect universe we'd toss these shitty vendors out but it's just too integrated now
[10:45:51] <Activ8> would they not just need their own mail server that supports basic auth
[10:46:09] <Activ8> Thats probably the answer
[10:46:20] <csws> yeah there's davmail
[10:46:29] <csws> it acts as a localhost imap server and translates the traffic into EWS calls
[10:46:31] <Activ8> There’s mail apps that still could do the job
[10:47:32] <Activ8> Looks like the big dogs are focusing on security this year
[10:47:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> imap has been updated quite a lot
[10:48:02] <sd> 11<H​otmess> which version is it running?
[10:48:07] <CptLuxx> and its still shit
[10:48:08] <CptLuxx> lol
[10:48:24] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as long as it meets secuirty requirements who cares
[10:48:45] <A-KO> I expect on-premises Exchange 2022 is going to layer on the security/oauth/oidc tech pretty heavily.
[10:48:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> do ms give out exhcange protocol for free?
[10:48:53] <A-KO> It's probably going to have a massive overhaul of authentication
[10:48:58] <A-KO> the protocol?
[10:49:03] <A-KO> the docs are all documented
[10:49:08] <A-KO> mapi's fully documented. activesync is fully documented
[10:49:13] <A-KO> ews is documented
[10:49:15] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but are they free to use or pay MS $?
[10:49:30] <A-KO> you can implement the protocols in whichever client you choose, however you want
[10:49:31] <A-KO> doesn't matter
[10:49:34] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as long as that is the case you will see companies using imap
[10:49:51] <sd> 11<H​otmess> else they walk into a lawsuit like tomtom did
[10:49:54] <A-KO> no. the only reason anyone uses imap is because they're a linux turd that thinks Thunderbird is a useful mail client
[10:50:09] <xe0n> mbox files ftw
[10:50:12] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or their lawyer told them to useit
[10:50:28] <sd> 11<H​otmess> not everything in our feild is for techinal reasons
[10:50:29] <A-KO> literally everyone else in the world has moved on to HTTP-based protocols and standards.
[10:50:51] <CptLuxx> a few months back i read the sip guys are jealous that they did not use http
[10:50:53] <CptLuxx> bwahah
[10:50:57] <A-KO> lol CptLuxx
[10:50:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> well appretnly not litterly everyone
[10:50:59] <Activ8> We have some users still on imap 
[10:51:00] <A-KO> fuck SIP is such a PITA
[10:51:00] <sd> 11<H​otmess> irc ppl
[10:51:01] <A-KO> so is ICE

[10:51:23] <A-KO> Troubleshooting Teams connectivity is a massive pain in the rear
[10:51:35] <xe0n> haha yeah there is some guidance to configure your network etc for it
[10:51:37] <A-KO> 99% of the time it's the firewall shit at work, mind you ; but getting the right data to prove that is...painful
[10:51:40] <Activ8> We still support them though because it’s pay per resolved ticket 
[10:52:01] <A-KO> xe0n: firewall team is still denying the firewall is interfering with one of our remote offices lol
[10:52:07] <A-KO> so when I finally get back to working, I'll dig into that
[10:52:08] <A-KO> and figure it out
[10:52:14] <xe0n> haha
[10:52:16] <A-KO> and then they'll go "oh"

[10:53:00] <A-KO> used to do it at previous jobs, too
[10:53:10] <Activ8> they will hate you for that

[17:22:59] <Hunterkll> if you do that set up a dedicated RDS licensing server 
[17:23:04] <fritzwastaken> hi thegodsquirrel 
[17:23:07] <Hunterkll> and key that
[17:23:12] <sd> 09<H​aise> okay
[17:23:13] <sd> 09<H​aise> will do
[17:23:14] <thegodsquirrel> Hi fritzwastaken 
[17:23:17] <Hunterkll> then you can just skate around and do whatever as long as you keep that VM 
[17:23:36] <sd> 09<H​aise> if I have that licensing host, I can keep adding new RDS session hosts ?
[17:23:41] <Hunterkll> yes
[17:23:45] <sd> 09<H​aise> okay got it
[17:23:45] <Hunterkll> its a central licensing pool 
[17:23:49] <AnonymooseReddtr> ROFL 
[17:23:57] <Hunterkll> i have a small ass like 512mb ram usage VM for my RDS licensing host 
[17:24:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> some guy is selling a box of 90's porn mags on facebook
[17:24:08] <Hunterkll> if you're using user CALS
[17:24:13] <Hunterkll> user A logs into RDS host #1 
[17:24:15] <Hunterkll> then #2
[17:24:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah I wouldn't bother setting up a dedicated RDSH licensing box
[17:24:23] <Hunterkll> then #3
[17:24:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> also RDS always uses cals :)
[17:24:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> either device or user
[17:24:30] <Hunterkll> its still only 1 cal used on the RDS licensing server
[17:24:43] <sd> 09<H​aise> okay
[17:24:44] <Hunterkll> so they can log into any RDS box but still only 1 cal used / assigned
[17:24:53] <sd> 09<H​aise> got it
[17:25:12] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: if you have more than one RDS host, using a licensing server (or licensing server on a central box) is critical
[17:25:20] <Hunterkll> otherwise you're gonna pay out the ass for more CALs you dont need
[17:25:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:26:49] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: if you DONT use a central licensing server and only license two servers for 10 user cals each (you boguht two 10 packs cus you have 20 users) then you have to tell each user to only log into RDS host X 
[17:27:04] <sd> 09<H​aise> I'm gonna hold off till Red Hat pushes WHQL verified drivers for Win Server 2022
[17:27:10] <Hunterkll> moment one crosses over they'll either be unable to login OR take up a spot someone else was supposed to have
[17:27:18] <AnonymooseReddtr> yes
[17:27:21] <AnonymooseReddtr> i realize that Hunterkll
[17:27:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> my point is the licensing service is so light weight that it does'nt need to be a dedicated box
[17:27:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> I normally install the licensing services on the first RDSH in my cluster
[17:27:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> :D
[17:27:50] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: we're talking about enviornments we fuck around in / tear up down etc 
[17:27:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> fair
[17:28:10] <Hunterkll> so the little licensing server is a VM you can keep around for years

[17:46:05] <thegodsquirrel> proxmox is fine
[17:46:06] <sd> 15<°​□°> can you name any other free open source alternatives?
[17:46:06] <PublicWiFi> ever
[17:46:08] <JollyRgrs> what's wrong with proxmox?
[17:46:10] <PublicWiFi> but its anecdotal lol
[17:46:13] <JollyRgrs> proxmox is fine for what it is
[17:46:13] <Hunterkll> But i'm saying - you could base with hyper-v and get say, better vCPU density 
[17:46:17] <sd> 09<H​aise> @°□° any distro with libvirt
[17:46:18] <Hunterkll> so more VMs per host essentially
[17:46:23] <Hunterkll> that's just *one* factor
[17:46:37] <PublicWiFi> JollyRgrs: you ever play rocket with jfdkthx?
[17:46:50] <Hunterkll> but if you're balls to the wall on the other side, then yea, RHEV makes sense (or bare KVM or xen or whatever)
[17:47:06] <Activ8> I like esxi server never used proxmox but loads of people use both 
[17:47:17] <sd> 09<H​aise> I ran Proxmox
[17:47:20] <sd> 09<H​aise> for 3 hours
[17:47:26] <sd> 09<H​aise> before wiping it for SLES
[17:47:28] <PublicWiFi> I almost like hyper-v better than esxi 
[17:47:36] <sd> 09<H​aise> nothing special, just a web ui wrapper
[17:47:41] <PublicWiFi> but i've neve done anything super indepth with esxi besides surface level VM work
[17:47:42] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: i want to say i may have once? i can't recall for sure though
[17:47:56] <PublicWiFi> ahh I jsut noticed him and his buds were all playin
[17:48:06] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: i read that as 'pocket rocket' and was REALLY CONFUSED
[17:48:20] <Hunterkll> s/play/pocket
[17:48:20] <layer8> PublicWiFi meant: "ahh I jsut noticed him and his buds were all pocketin"
[17:48:24] <Hunterkll> LOL
[17:48:25] <JollyRgrs> i used to run bare KVM, then switched to proxmox just b/c easier to manage with the web gui. that's really all proxmox is, just KVM + Qemu frontend
[17:48:25] <Hunterkll> oh well
[17:48:27] <Hunterkll> close enough 
[17:48:36] <Activ8> It depends on the person or team n what they like n what their IT budget is really
[17:48:38] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: oh, didn't know he had buds, lol
[17:48:55] <sd> 09<H​aise> JollyRgrs: all of my stuff is immutable so there is no reason for me to run Proxmox at all, hell I barely interact with virt-manager
[17:49:04] <sd> 09<H​aise> all of interaction comes through Terraform and Ansible
[17:49:13] <sd> 09<H​aise> though I am preparing to wipe Terraform for Pulumi
[17:49:20] <sd> 09<H​aise> cause Terraform has some issues
[17:49:22] <sd> 09<H​aise> like loops
[17:49:33] <sd> 09<H​aise> Pulumi is choose your favorite programming lang
[17:49:34] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Haise you have done any Terraform work with Azure data factory?
[17:49:36] <sd> 09<H​aise> here is module for it
[17:49:38] <sd> 09<H​aise> and yolo
[17:49:43] <sd> 09<H​aise> bdenlinger: nope
[17:49:54] <sd> 09<H​aise> only thing I've done with Azure is blob storage and their PGSQL implementation
[17:49:55] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I had to switch back to ARM templates
[17:50:06] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> cause it's missing like 50% of the features
[17:50:30] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Was hoping someone had and had a better solution
[17:51:01] <JollyRgrs> yeah, proxmox just made it easier for spinning up a new VM for me, wasn't as much about admining currently running VMs
[17:51:55] <sd> 09<H​aise> JollyRgrs: have you tried Terraform + Ansible + cloud-init at all ?
[17:51:55] <sd> 09<H​aise> It makes spinning up VMs basically no effort for me
[17:52:05] <JollyRgrs> @Haise no.... b/c this is just for my homeprod
[17:52:09] <PublicWiFi> I've been meaning to do that setup at home @H​aise
[17:52:19] <PublicWiFi> so I can get my foot in the devops door lol
[17:52:35] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> lol dude homeprod should be run like business prod
[17:52:35] <JollyRgrs> eventually I would like to get there, but I have other projects I want to work on, so I don't have time to learn new stuff
[17:52:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> that's the whole point
[17:52:48] <sd> 09<H​aise> makes sense JollyRgrs
[17:52:51] <JollyRgrs> I tried puppet w/ foreman years ago now... but only got 80% working before I Got distracted
[17:53:01] <sd> 09<H​aise> Foreman is a disaster to maintain
[17:53:20] <sd> 09<H​aise> I dreaded doing upgrades
[17:53:23] <JollyRgrs> @bdenlinger my wife/kids make CAB/change windows worse than what anyone would have to deal with for work
[17:53:31] <sd> 09<H​aise> PublicWiFi: I would tell you to use Pulumi instead of Terraform but Terraform is more popular
[17:53:36] <sd> 09<H​aise> Pulumi is really fucking good shit
[17:53:46] <sd> 09<H​aise> cause you interact with it through programming language
[17:53:51] <sd> 09<H​aise> and possibilities are endless with it
[17:55:24] <sd> 09<H​aise> Hunterkll: No WHQL verified drivers for Server 2022 :c
[17:55:38] <sd> 09<H​aise> neither Red Hat or SUSE have published them
[17:55:45] <PublicWiFi> @H​aise almost all "devops" job listings I see ask for terraform exp
[17:55:55] <sd> 09<H​aise> yeah, as I said its more popular
[17:57:37] <sd> 13<C​olour> I like HyperV for small setups and ESXi seems good for really big setups
[17:57:54] <sd> 13<C​olour> If you have a single server I'd totes go HyperV
[17:58:06] <sd> 13<C​olour> But at that point you prolly should be putting it all in cloud services
[17:58:27] <PublicWiFi> idk
[17:58:27] <sd> 11<H​otmess> workgroup hyper -v is a fucking arse
[17:58:35] <sd> 13<C​olour> Well you still have AD of course god
[17:58:36] <PublicWiFi> im not a huge on the "put everything in the cloud" idea
[17:58:52] <sd> 13<C​olour> I like that it's an option
[17:58:55] <sd> 13<C​olour> I don't want it to be forced

[17:58:56] <sd> 11<H​otmess> me and you public
[17:59:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> right there with you

[17:59:23] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as its cheaper
[17:59:39] <sd> 11<H​otmess> alot of places went cloud and found how much they had to pay
[18:01:02] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[18:04:41] <JollyRgrs> CIOs went to cloud b/c it looks good on resume, then they jump ship before the bills start to stack up
[18:04:56] <sd> 11<H​otmess> probably
[18:05:10] <sd> 13<C​olour> Ye
[18:05:47] <JollyRgrs> if you can move 100% to cloud and remove any need for an on-prem DC, there's some extra savings that could make up for SOME of the additional costs of going cloud...
[18:06:06] <PublicWiFi> depends on your org
[18:06:24] <PublicWiFi> larger orgs can structure their teams to reflect the changes
[18:06:33] <PublicWiFi> smaller ones kind of eat the costs
[18:06:40] <JollyRgrs> but all those 24x7x365 high-powered servers (SQL databases that can't be ran as a cloud service, etc) really negate most savings
[18:07:00] <JollyRgrs> and yeah, always depends on the size and structure of the org's IT teams
[18:07:17] <sd> 09<H​aise> some stuff for me doesn't make sense in cloud
[18:07:22] <sd> 09<H​aise> like cloud managed network devices
[18:07:32] <sd> 13<C​olour> Hahhhh bloody hate cloud managed network devices how insane
[18:07:32] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Putting too much weight on the backend is a design issue, not a cloud issue.
[18:07:50] <sd> 13<C​olour> Ohno a config change means I have no internet access
[18:08:02] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> A caching layer between the app and DB layer is helpful in avoiding those issues
[18:08:12] <JollyRgrs> what's wrong with cloud managed network devices?
[18:08:19] <JollyRgrs> :P
[18:08:34] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Dont get me start
[18:08:41] <sd> 09<H​aise> as Colour said, if you have lets say router config change and you misconfigure it
[18:08:43] <sd> 13<C​olour> Clouds are wet and get the equipment all rusty
[18:08:44] <sd> 09<H​aise> bam no internet access
[18:09:00] <sd> 13<C​olour> Ahem I would never misconfigure it
[18:09:00] <sd> 13<C​olour> 
[18:09:00] <sd> 13<C​olour> A work colleague might.
[18:09:02] <sd> 09<H​aise> or if cloud goes down for maintenance and you can't change config that you need to know asap
[18:09:06] <sd> 13<C​olour> I would have to fix their error
[18:09:12] <JollyRgrs> so ezpz, just revert your change... your device is quantum coupled with the cloud management
[18:09:14] <JollyRgrs> right?
[18:09:31] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or the cloud is feature lite soution
[18:09:34] <sd> 11<H​otmess> cough cough meraki
[18:09:36] <sd> 13<C​olour> You assume too much
[18:09:56] <PublicWiFi> BUT THE QUARKS
