[17:45:58] <fnutt> Cannot wait to update from Google Cloud Always free F1-micro to E2-micro for free. It's a 0,05 vCPU and 0,4 GB ram upgrade.
[17:46:13] <fnutt> I wonder how it will affect The Lounge performance.
[17:46:45] <shadoozo> if you want higher spec vps then oracle free vps's might be something
[17:47:54] <fnutt> Oracle free vps seems good indeed. However, it's Oracle... and I have a feeling it's more likely for them to stop the always free campain than Google.
[17:48:26] <fnutt> Also, I don't want to redo everything regarding The Lounge, setting up firewall etc. :p
[17:48:46] <fnutt> Wouldn't mind the free performance of Oracle always free vps though.
[17:49:20] <fnutt> If I had to redo the installation, I would have just used sudo-user.
[17:49:48] <fnutt> Adding another user just makes it more complicated. Don't think The Lounge will fuck up something on my VPS anyway.
[17:51:42] <fnutt> "2 AMD based Compute VMs with 1/8 OCPU** and 1 GB memory each."
[17:51:42] <fnutt> "4 Arm-based Ampere A1 cores and 24 GB of memory usable as one VM or up to 4 VMs."
[17:52:20] <fnutt> What does this mean? Do you get 24 GB ram for the VM? or is it 1/8th of a virtual cpu core and 1 GB ram?
[17:52:39] <fnutt> I assume you use this, shadoozo?
