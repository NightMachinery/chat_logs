[02:27:47] <Joanna> As I see it scientists just like to experiment on all sorts of things. Most of the time they are relegated to torturing animals and everyone looks the other way but occasionally they get lucky and have people to experiment upon and they jump at the opportunity and experiment as much as possible. I saw a documentary about Japanese experimenting on people in China in all sorts of horrible ways. After the war the Americans 
[02:27:47] <Joanna> enthusiastically collected all the “research results”
[02:30:18] <jessicara> think most experiments involve inanimate things which can't be tortured
[02:31:43] <Joanna> Afterwards it usually turns out that nothing really beneficial is discovered by people who experimented like that. This time is really the largest easiest time they have ever had getting people to experiment upon. All they had to do is control the news media and people came to them. No need to even resort to rounding up people and sending them to prison camps or kidnapping them off the streets..
[02:32:43] <Joanna> jessicara: like computer code :)
[02:34:24] <Joanna> Most of the recent events are an experiment into how gullible and easy to scare people are. And the results are they are about as smart as livestock in most cases..
[02:35:24] <Joanna> Which isn’t a bad thing if they have good leadership. Unfortunately this isn’t the case.
[02:36:10] <jessicara> as far as i recall, a lot of what are seeing now seems to come from the idea that if you just let people loose to do whatever that they will self-organise, so deregulate all the things
[02:36:32] <jessicara> but instead people exploit the lack of control, come in take their own control, end up with a new elite
[02:36:38] <Joanna> People who don’t think for themselves are necessary for civilization as we know it to exist.
[02:37:46] <Joanna> Yea that’s how people are most want to be serfs basically. I’ve seen it in video games also.
[02:40:07] <Joanna> As for the doctors being incompetent that starts with their medical schooling. They are educated to promote pharma.
[02:40:11] <jessicara> i guess have learned something from uk government though, are willing to turn themselves in to an incoherant mess to keep up both the 'media halo' and the pretense of neutrality for their own propaganda at the same time
[02:41:07] <Joanna> That’s is one of their techniques is acting confused after they do something horrible
[02:42:35] <Joanna> Have you ever heard of milgram experiment? Most people can be made into torturers/murderers if an authority figure tells them to.
[02:42:41] <jessicara> yeah i know
[02:44:10] <Joanna> After it’s all over the flunkies who followed orders get punished not the people who gave the orders. It was true of Nazi guards and soldiers in Iraq
[02:45:08] <Joanna> There will never be and justice at all for all the atrocities that have been committed. There never is.
[02:47:00] <Joanna> See you later..afk

[17:07:31] <jan6> just in case you wanna share with newer people
[17:08:04] <jan6> "use tor, use burner phone, remove EXIF data from images" etc
[17:12:34] <iz> there are some amazing ways to figure out where video was recorded now
[17:12:59] <jan6> are there?
[17:13:12] <iz> yeah, but i guess at a protest, they already know where it is happening
[17:13:21] <jan6> and yeah, pointless, there
[17:13:41] <iz> these are more like.. for kidnappers doing ransom videos and things where they are trying to keep thier location secret, but leaking lots of info
[17:15:31] <iz> the flicker of lights connected to AC power can give away a lot of location info, b/c the phases are slightly different depending on where it's being supplied from
[17:18:08] <jan6> yeah tom scott did a video on that power hum
[17:18:23] <jan6> not only lights, but other stuff would work too
[17:19:58] <iz> yeah, it can be done w/ the hum and just audio also

[18:15:57] <Joanna> Interesting stuff :)
[18:16:43] <Joanna> Another they can probably use are voice prints
[18:17:14] <iz> well, most ppl think to mask thier voices
[18:17:39] <iz> but few think to worry about the lights or other appliances that might hum that are plugged into AC power
[18:21:25] <jessicara> there is of course the option of not using a phone and not broadcasting everything constantly
[18:21:33] <jessicara> leave your phone at home
[18:21:48] <iz> that would be my recommendation for the protest use-case
[18:22:20] <jessicara> and get in to a habit of leaving your phone at home when you are unlikely to need it, so it seems normal for you to do so
[18:22:20] <iz> but ppl are dumb and egotistical and want to share thier activities to social media
[18:22:53] <jessicara> yeah imagine getting a burner phone and logging in to the same account as do on the regular phone
[18:23:08] <iz> lol yeah, it happens a lot though
[18:23:42] <jessicara> think this is going to be even more important as dissent becomes increasingly cracked down on
[18:24:11] <jessicara> donating to the trucker convoy and losing access to all your accounts for doing so, hand is revealed on how will deal with a perceived threat
[18:24:25] <jessicara> will want that information as far away from regular life as possible
[18:25:24] <iz> ppl are just dumb, b/c they are sheltered from real crack downs in america
[18:25:40] <iz> and most of them have never left the country before
[18:26:07] <iz> going up to other countries and trying to claim first amendment rights
[18:26:16] <jessicara> lol
[18:26:22] <jessicara> seriously have done that?
[18:26:41] <iz> yes, there were lots of ppl at that trucker thing in canada doing that
[18:26:45] <jessicara> you don't even have a right to a lawyer right away here
[18:27:15] <jessicara> can be detained and lied to about what is really happening for 2-3 days without a lawyer to get you to incriminate yourself
[18:27:33] <jessicara> very unlike america
[18:28:56] <jessicara> well, the front anyway
[18:29:11] <jessicara> other countries don't need to pretend though
[18:29:45] <iz> https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1495430376042422273
[18:30:41] <jessicara> an american in a canadian court?
[18:30:52] <jessicara> or canadians thinking have the same laws as america?
[18:30:53] <jessicara> can imagine both
[18:31:17] <iz> i remember seeing both, but i think that one was just a tragically dumb canadian

[21:48:39] <Atque> jessicara: Yeah, try imagine an American being in a Canadian court and not realising the tort of negligence does not include breach of statutory duty. Then, some guy sues for breach of statutory duty and the American refers to it as negligence and the judge laughs at him and he feels very embarrassed. That would be sad hey.
[21:50:47] <jessicara> is why normally listen to your lawyer, the law is a minefield even within own country let alone when cross the border
[21:51:16] <jessicara> anything you say can be used against you, not for you
[21:52:07] <Atque> Well, in the US, there is a right to silence, but there isn't necessarily in other common law countries.
[21:52:32] <jessicara> even then silence is better usually
[21:54:29] <Atque> Yeah, most of the time lawyers advise not to respond to questions, letters of demand etc.
[21:54:53] <jessicara> here also you have to give up encryption keys to law enforcement
[21:55:06] <Atque> Yea
[21:55:11] <Atque> UK?
[21:55:13] <jessicara> yeah
[21:55:26] <jessicara> prison for this seems like the better option than to get others in trouble
[21:56:09] <Atque> Well... depends I guess. If your emails etc are innocent, giving it up leads to no punishment.
[21:56:23] <jessicara> innocence is irrelevant
[21:56:50] <jessicara> if the narrative is that you are guilty, the evidence can't help you
[21:57:21] <Atque> Well, if you have a fair police and court system, it should do
[21:57:30] <jessicara> i do not think it is fair
[21:57:43] <jessicara> breaks it's own laws, doesn't declare conflicts of interest
[21:57:45] <Atque> Understandably, that may not be the case, but that is a public policy failure I guess.
[21:57:47] <jessicara> is how it is
[21:58:22] <jessicara> things which are illegal become effectively illegal by reinterpreting it all after the fact ignoring any inconvenient laws
[21:58:27] <jessicara> are legal*
[22:01:28] <jessicara> so yeah, the law means something different every day pretty much
