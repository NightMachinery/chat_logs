[22:21:15] <termer> Hey guys, I've been using TheLounge for over 2 years now and it's great, helped move a bunch of friends over from Discord to IRC comfortably
[22:21:53] <termer> right now I'm wondering when 4.3.0 will be released, since the last pre-release was in July, and there have been plenty of new features added since then
[22:22:14] <termer> I've been watching the GitHub issues and there are plenty of things that I'd like to use, but I'm waiting for a proper release first
[22:22:25] <termer> is there any planned ETA on the full release of 4.3.0?
[22:28:53] *** Joins: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp)
[22:29:08] <Activ8> there is no ETA termer
[22:29:20] <termer> that's what I figured
[22:29:30] <Activ8> it's as and when the devs think it's ready
[22:30:00] <termer> Ideally I can get a feel for how ready they think it is

[22:56:27] <Activ8> termer that will be the database/logs and scroll back.  The more channels you are in the bigger and faster it increases
[22:56:56] <termer> so does it just load it to memory after you scroll, or what?
[22:57:06] <termer> I was under the impression it immediately stored it in SQLite
[22:57:31] <termer> a lot of that may also be in memory though
[23:00:34] <Activ8> it all depends if you set up logging for users in private mode and your config settings I believe.  You are in private mode I assume right?
[23:04:02] <termer> yeah

[23:11:16] <mooff> termer: fwiw, using the Debian version, i recommend: chmod o-rx /etc/thelounge
[23:11:38] <termer> What does that do
[23:11:49] <termer> is that to restrict it from being read by others?
[23:12:02] <mooff> it prevents your logs from being world-readable
[23:12:12] <mooff> and the push notification API key

[23:13:50] <Activ8> when you use the .deb install it does it on it's own
[23:13:57] <Activ8> sets the lounge permissions IIRC
[23:14:02] *** Joins: thelounge7785639 (~thelounge@90.199.35.75)
[23:14:10] <Activ8> I don't use the .deb now I use docker 
[23:14:56] <mooff> the .deb has installed /etc/thelounge with 775 permissions for at least 4 years or so
[23:15:16] <mooff> /etc/thelounge/users is not world-readable, nor config.js, but vapid.json and logs/ are
[23:15:33] <mooff> as well as uploads/
[23:17:16] <Activ8> ah right so if it was world readable by default and you install it on a reverse proxy would they access it via a url some how externally?
[23:17:18] <MaxLeiter> and im back, that was easy 
[23:17:33] <Activ8> hello user thelounge5191 lol
[23:19:06] <mooff> Activ8: world-readable in the sense that any shell user can read them
[23:19:27] <Activ8> wouldn't be a problem then if there was just 1 shell user
[23:21:39] <mooff> say you ran a PHP forum on the same server, and it gets hacked - the attacker can grab your IRC logs, uploaded files, where they don't need to be able to
[23:22:45] <Activ8> ah right well I think you got more to worry about than irc logs unless you doing something you shouldn't be lol
[23:22:53] <Activ8> if it gets hacked that's another story
[23:23:01] <mooff> IRC logs often include NickServ convos where you send your password
[23:23:23] <mooff> private convos with friends, partners, etc
[23:23:45] <mooff> it don't think it's a non-issue.. i originally thought it probably warranted a cve
[23:23:59] <Activ8> I wouldn't have much to worry about if it happened to me, but I do understand where you are coming from
[23:24:20] <Activ8> maybe the deb should be modified then when it sets permissions in that case
[23:24:33] <Activ8> I'm still learning so not sure what things should be
[23:24:59] <Activ8> what should the permissions be if that was the case? instead of 775 maybe 644? 
[23:25:37] <mooff> my PR to thelounge-deb changing to 0700 to match Docker installs got push back
[23:26:11] <mooff> PR to thelounge to correct existing installs to 0700 declined
[23:26:14] <Activ8> I'm not experienced enough to prove that concept for security so can't really comment
[23:26:44] <Activ8> if the lounge user only has r/w and root then surely nothing else can access it

[23:28:14] <Activ8> if someone was to gain access to shell/ssh then there is bigger problems IMO
[23:28:35] <Activ8> does it work fine with perms 700?
[23:29:28] <Activ8> So perm 700 would mean, User - r-w-x only.
[23:30:36] <mooff> it works with 700, which is what the Docker install uses
[23:31:40] <mooff> i'm not as salty as might be coming across, i'm just miffed that no-one is concerned

[23:33:49] <MaxLeiter> mooff: thelounge PR was denied because chmodding is not ideal (it should be handled by thelounge-deb). I haven't looked at the deb PR in a bit, I'll get to it 
[23:35:48] <mooff> MaxLeiter: i get ya
[23:45:20] <Activ8> I don't think this is much of a problem in the docker version though as been in docker has another layer of security if it's been used behind a reverse proxy
[23:49:08] <mooff> Activ8: using a reverse proxy is orthogonal / separate fwiw
[23:49:20] <mooff> i used a reverse proxy to the Debian install, too
[23:49:48] <Activ8> Are you speaking from experience here? Has something happened to you to test your securty?
[23:49:57] <mooff> the Docker install is protected in two ways: 1) Docker container files aren't world-readable on the host by default (try 'ls /var/lib/docker' as a regular user)
[23:51:31] <Activ8> got ya
[23:52:08] <mooff> 2) the Docker image doesn't ship a TL home directory, iirc, so the logic in TL that creates the dir with 700 permissions if it doesn't exist gets triggered on first run
[23:53:02] <mooff> the deb installer includes an /etc/thelounge with 775, so the creation logic in TL doesn't run
[23:53:15] <Activ8> ah right
[23:53:48] <mooff> Activ8: an IRL friend gave me an account on his VPS, and i give several friends accounts on mine
[23:54:00] <mooff> so it's more common for me to expect there to be users other than me on a server
[23:54:24] <Activ8> so this is for a multi user environment then mainly
[23:54:29] <mooff> if that IRL friend installed thelounge, i shouldn't be able to read their private conversations
[23:54:59] <Activ8> unless they got into your account ....
[23:55:04] <Activ8> I understand
[23:55:28] <Activ8> a per user perm setting then
[23:58:20] <mooff> Activ8: if you have Redis installed, notice that /var/lib/redis chmod 750 by default..
[23:58:33] <mooff> because the database files shouldn't readable by any old user, program on the server
[23:58:49] <Activ8> I don't know what redis is but yeh 
[23:59:44] <mooff> a per user perm setting isn't needed so much as just a sensible default :)
