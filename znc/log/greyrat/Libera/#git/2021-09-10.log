[00:58:45] <euouae> but if I rebase, how do I insert a commit before the changes commit?
[00:59:06] <euouae> e.g. commit Y has changes + formatting. I want to insert commit X before it, that only has formatting. Then force-push
[00:59:40] <dodo> euouae: um... are the changes and the reformatting mixed?
[00:59:44] <euouae> yeah
[01:00:00] <dodo> i mean, do both touch the same lines?
[01:00:14] <bookworm> reset the change, stage individual hunks
[01:00:22] <euouae> what are hunks?
[01:00:36] <bookworm> changes in the code in different regions
[01:00:37] <dodo> or reset it and apply the reformatting tool
[01:00:42] <dodo> erm
[01:01:10] <euouae> But how do I apply a commit for the reformatting without affecting the changes?
[01:01:37] <euouae> if I changed '  foo' to 'foobar', and instead it should be two commits, 'foo' and 'foobar', how do I do it?
[01:02:33] <euouae> The issue being, if I reset, I will have unstaged 'foobar' and I don't want to delete my changes...
[01:04:09] <bookworm> it doesn't delete them

[01:04:34] <euouae> but the file being unstaged, I want to modify it
[01:05:10] <bookworm> sure, the changes will drop to the working tree, so just modify at your leisure, stage and commit
[01:05:24] <euouae> but then I've lost my changes?
[01:05:37] <euouae> I need to commit a version of the file that does not include my changes, just the formatting
[01:05:38] <bookworm> no!
[01:05:45] <euouae> if I do that, I will have lost my changes
[01:05:52] <bookworm> again, no
[01:06:37] <euouae> I don't get it
[01:06:42] <bookworm> you have 3 things in git, working tree (disc), index (staging area) and the state of the repo (the commits)
[01:07:17] <bookworm> reset can take stuff from level 3 (the state of the repo) and drop them to the working tree, that's what my screenshot showed
[01:07:35] <euouae> OK. Then ?
[01:07:36] <bookworm> I've virtually undone the commit without loosing the changes
[01:07:47] <euouae> but then I need to change things on disc and commit!
[01:07:57] <euouae> I will lose the things I had committed

[01:11:04] <bookworm> same answer, reset the commit

[01:13:01] <bookworm> so why do you still think you'll loose anything?
[01:13:17] <euouae> because I think you're saying that I should do a reset, bring everything to working tree and then
[01:13:23] <bookworm> yes
[01:13:32] <euouae> and then, I really am not sure how you want me to format the code and remove my changes
[01:13:34] <euouae> without losing my changes
[01:13:35] <bookworm> that doesn't loose anything but the commit message
[01:13:52] <bookworm> you'd modify the code locally, as usual
[01:14:00] <euouae> ok but then my changes are gone
[01:14:08] <euouae> I want to format the previous code that I cloned
[01:14:08] <bookworm> no, why?
[01:14:19] <bookworm> gimme a sec
[01:14:19] <euouae> they want me to commit a format of the previous code, not the code with my changes
[01:15:38] <euouae> OK I'll try in an empty repo, with your advice

[01:21:28] <euouae> It's like the paste link I gave

[01:22:36] <bookworm> generally it should be locally scoped right? So changes and formatting in different parts of the code?
[01:22:47] <euouae> nope, changes and formatting in the same parts as well...
[01:23:03] <bookworm> sure but you only need to untangle those parts
[01:23:14] <bookworm> did you do the formatting by hand?
[01:23:20] <euouae> no it was clang-format
[01:23:31] <bookworm> if not why care? just apply the real changes, then rerun the formatter
[01:24:24] <euouae> What do you mean?
[01:24:34] <bookworm> if you want the formatter to run first, make a new branch on top of Master or develop or what have you, apply formatter then commit
[01:24:53] <bookworm> then merge your actual changes on top, it'll be a fast forward
[01:24:57] <euouae> Yeah, then how do I place that commit before the other commit in my other branch?
[01:25:05] <bookworm> as the formatter is deterministic
[01:25:07] <euouae> so I have branch-foo where I've done my stuff
[01:25:17] <euouae> you're saying make branch-bar with the formatting. How do I then modify branch-foo?
[01:25:35] <bookworm> you don't have too, just merge it
[01:25:46] <euouae> but how do I force-push?
[01:25:53] <euouae> if I merge branches does the name stay the same?

[02:08:47] <euouae> just brilliant
[02:08:55] <bookworm> that's git for you
[02:09:05] <bookworm> just... confusing :)
[02:09:12] <euouae> Yeah I kind of get it. `git checkout stuff; git branch -b chagnes; git rebase other`
[02:09:15] <bookworm> you'll get used to it
[02:09:21] <euouae> No, this is a good trick. I need to learn this.
[02:09:44] <bookworm> you can skip the backup branch, i just didn't want to do remote reflog
[02:10:03] <bookworm> panicked users do things, that'd be bad then
[02:10:14] <bookworm> so I rather have an easy backup ;P
[02:10:19] <bookworm> (no offense)
[02:10:52] <euouae> hehe
[02:11:31] <euouae> I totally understand, in fact being careful is so important. I've done... stupid things. Like the one time I realized I had saved in a usb backup some very important data; I was so glad; then I somehow mounted the data and deleted it.
[02:12:30] <bookworm> happens exactly once I hope... I mean rm -rf ~ was a one time only thing for me
[02:12:52] <bookworm> wanted to delete a ~ folder in the local dir which I've introduced by mistake
[02:13:20] <bookworm> it's a lesson I wouldn't recommend
[02:13:30] <euouae> oh no hahah
[02:14:14] <euouae> so what you're saying is that `git checkout a; git rebase b` is all I need to know right?
[02:14:30] <euouae> This would apply the changes of `a` as if `b` was committed first?

[10:18:49] <Mo> Hi, question about https://github.com/Zygo/bees/commits/master, the last commit about "TOTAL RATES" was on Aug 31, but if I clone the repo, git log says Jun 22. Why?
[10:19:28] <foo> How can I see a git log history of changes on a specific file?
[10:21:40] <Mo> foo: git log <file>
[10:23:37] <foo> Mo: oh, I thought I tried that. Thanks.
[10:26:37] <jinsun> Mo: github is probably showing commit date, and git log is showing author date
[10:26:46] *** Quits: CommunistWolf (~gulag@user/communistwolf) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:28:14] <Mo> jinsun: What is author date? I started comparing because git log has a different sorting than the showed date, probably sorting for commit date and showing author date.

[10:31:48] <jinsun> a commit just has two dates associated with it, when you create a new commit then both author date and commit date are set to the time when it was created
[10:32:30] <jinsun> Mo: but if you amend a commit using rebase or --amend or something, then usually only the commit date changes
[10:33:39] <bradyt> github relies too much on dates for display, so they better use commit date
[10:33:59] <bradyt> author dates can easily be out of order without any doctoring
[10:34:19] <bradyt> but you can doctor commit dates to make github's display kinda garbage
[10:35:10] <bradyt> i think git log uses parent-child, so it's free to put any date i guess

[19:40:45] <SilverFox> heyo! This is sorta off topic and weird but, we use a lot of git pipelines and stuff and have a lot of branches etc, im wondering.. is there perhaps a digital signage software or something similar that could, display a few stats and update them whenever? sorta like gitg with the branch view or, idk just throwing it out there if anybody has used anything like that before!
[19:41:34] <teut> my project has a single branch master,  now a colleague clones the repo , works on it, I meanwhile work on the master branch add few commits , so now we have a diversion, now he sends a pull request
[19:41:57] <teut> I click the fat green button on github of "rebase and merge"

[19:42:44] <teut> so if rebase happens then all commits of him should be cherry picked and  added to front of my master
[19:42:49] <teut> is this correct ?
[19:42:59] <teut> I got no conflicts
[19:43:18] <SilverFox> if nothing he did conflicted with anything you did, then the changes even to the same file can come together
[19:43:32] <SilverFox> like a zipper ;3
[19:44:11] <SilverFox> to be sure its the functionality u want, u could merge master back into your developing bracnch, test/ci/cd whatever and then confirm its ok to merge back to master

[20:28:47] <elibrokeit> If you get up in the morning and look outside the window, then see it's a beautiful day. How do you "reject looking out the window"?
[20:29:06] <teut> yes , I get it, so if I do git pull
[20:29:23] <elibrokeit> You could do it by inventing a mind-wiping device and removing your own memories I guess.
[20:29:36] <another|> fetch is basically "download stuff from the remote but don't do anything with it"
[20:29:51] <teut> it will fetch again from github and modify my local

[22:16:41] <elibrokeit> Will add links
[22:17:14] <teut> someone told me earlier git rebase is just git cherry pick   all commits
[22:17:32] <elibrokeit> Specifically it adds "cherry-picked from commit X" style comments to the commit message, and those commit hashes are links in most repository browsers.

[22:38:26] <teut> so I also squashed last 2 commits, one was the latest commit from the other guy and before it was mine, so  I put a "s" on his commit in interative rebase, now what did this thing do?

[22:48:58] <imMute> ok I've never used HTTPS before, but I thought it normally just asked for the credentials when you push/fetch

[22:49:48] <lantech19446> but for some reason it's got them stuck in this one
[22:49:52] <imMute> oh.  so just enter the credentials you want to use.   there's nothing to "change"
