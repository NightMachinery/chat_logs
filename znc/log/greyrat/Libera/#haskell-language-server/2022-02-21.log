[21:13:05] <komikat> Hey, I looked at the language server projects for 2022 and I'm interested in working on https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/discussions/2700?sort=new#discussioncomment-2169098
[21:14:15] <komikat> I think michaelpj is probably the mentor for this, hey there
[21:15:57] <fendor[m]> so until they answer, you can take a look at specifics of LSP (not sure how familiar you are already), look at the lsp package, etc...
[21:16:48] <komikat> sure yeah makes sense
[21:17:55] <komikat> does this channel log messages because I might disconnect and wouldn't be able to look at the conversation later
[21:18:42] <komikat> kinda new to IRC in general, so I'm not sure how conversations work here
[21:25:49] <michaelpj> komikat: yo
[21:26:09] <michaelpj> I don't think this channel logs messages, so if you want to have a persistent discussion, better to do it on an issue or something!
[21:26:41] <komikat> sure yeah that works
[21:27:05] <michaelpj> but it can be nice to chat synchronously also :0
[21:27:06] <michaelpj> :)

[21:33:16] <komikat> of course
[21:34:41] <komikat> my plan is to look at the codebase and maybe take inspiration from other language servers which have already implemented those features
[21:39:38] <fendor[m]> komikat: if you use matrix, you usually have a somewhat buggy persistent chat
[21:39:54] <fendor[m]> e.g. it is quite simple to create an account for element.io
[21:40:16] <komikat> fendor[m]: I'm in the haskell matrix I think
[21:40:23] <komikat> not sure if theres an lsp channel though
[21:40:52] <fendor[m]> then you can join this channel as well and matrix logs it automatically, iirc
[21:41:12] <fendor[m]> lsp channel for lsp discussions in general or haskell's lsp package?
[21:42:10] <komikat> I meant this channel 
[21:42:57] *** Joins: AkshitKumar[m] (~komikatma@2001:470:69fc:105::1:c71e)
[21:43:02] <komikat> ah very convenient
[21:43:23] <fendor[m]> I joined this channel via element.io (matrix client), it works well. 
[21:43:23] *** AkshitKumar[m] is now known as komikat[m]
[21:43:38] <komikat[m]> yeah I'm using that as well, very cool
[21:43:57] <komikat[m]> oh the [m] stands for matrix
[21:44:57] <fendor[m]> yeah. I suspect the bridge is slightly buggy, sometimes messages sent from irc take multiple minutes before they show up in matrix
[21:45:36] <komikat[m]> yeah that seems to be the case, my matrix messages lag by a few seconds when viewed from the irc client
[21:45:53] <komikat[m]> milliseconds* 
[21:47:13] <fendor[m]> sometimes it is worse than just a few ms or even seconds. Anyway, with matrix you have a somewhat persistent log
[22:04:02] <michaelpj> <komikat> "my plan is to look at the..." <- That seems sensible! I think having a non-code sketch of how you might implement the feature would be a good thing. E.g. go look at the AST to get X, transform it in Y way
