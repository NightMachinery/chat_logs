[02:54:33] <qergle> LTCD: they're saying that 6 is the cube root of 7
[02:54:43] <Z-module> it turns out that every element of Z_11 has a unique cube root in Z_11 -- this isn't true in every Z_p

[03:54:44] <dk657> PlanckWalk: "metric projection onto a closed, convex set is non-expansive"
[03:55:17] <dk657> this is not my realm, so i am grubbing for scraps on the internet
[03:55:36] <dk657> not yet really knowing what i'm talking about
[03:55:54] <PlanckWalk> Which projection does that statement talk about?
[03:56:43] <PlanckWalk> It's certainly not true for general projections on general metric spaces
[03:57:03] <PlanckWalk> (Even for closed, convex sets)
[03:57:24] <PlanckWalk> (To the extent that "convex" even means anything for general metric spaces)
[03:58:37] <PlanckWalk> So I presume there's some context in which that makes sense, and that in that context there's a theorem you're trying to prove.
[03:58:39] <dk657> PlanckWalk: great question. it's unspoken in the textbook where it first appeared (engl, hanke, neubauer's regularization of inverse problems), or at least hidden enough that i can't find it
[03:59:45] <dk657> but we are in a hilbert space, and i gather that it is something like P_C(x) = argmin_{y in C} ||x-y||
[04:00:14] <dk657> when i say "first appeared" i mean first appeared in front of my eyes
[04:00:32] <PlanckWalk> Ah, okay.  Hilbert spaces have lots of structure and that looks like a projection operator for which the statement might be true

[04:02:48] <dk657> mm indeed
[04:03:11] <PlanckWalk> So I think you need the closedness just to be sure that it's well defined.
[04:03:28] <dk657> to be totally concrete, my "C" is the set of square-integrable probability density functions
[04:04:00] <dk657> which is certainly convex, and i "felt" might be closed in L2 until 30 minutes ago :P
[04:05:48] <dk657> maybe i need another condition to make things happy
[04:07:55] <PlanckWalk> In spaces like that you often have to do things like equate functions where the difference has zero square integral.

[04:09:00] <dk657> the pathology i noticed is sequences of PDFs that get more spread out can converge in L2 to the zero function
[04:09:01] <PlanckWalk> Sinplest example being say the indicator function on [0,1], and that on (0,1)
[04:10:03] <dk657> so (1/n)*Indicator[0,n] is a pdf, but the sequence of such functions converges in L2 to zero
[04:10:07] <PlanckWalk> You mean like f(n) = 1/(2n) on [-n,n]?
[04:10:13] <PlanckWalk> Or that yes
[04:10:18] <dk657> and zero ain't a pdf

[04:10:48] <dk657> yeah exactly
[04:11:48] <dk657> well dang

[04:12:26] <dk657> and also an example of the problem you indicated
[04:12:37] <dk657> what's the projection of the zero function onto the set of PDFs?
[04:13:01] <PlanckWalk> Right, the norm gets as close as you like to zero.

[06:32:58] <buster> sounds like a good placeholder for argument's sake. then what happens?
[06:33:16] <Fangs> ok I did quantified z in the definition of limit, but didn't in the negation

[06:35:42] <buster> try eps=|f(z0)-L|/2

[06:55:23] <newpy> I'm reading the beginning of Feller, and I'm confused by this example
[06:56:23] <newpy> "Seven-way lamps." Some floor lamps so advertised contain 3 ordinary bulbs and also an indirect lighting fixture which can be operated on three levels but need not be used at all. Each of these four possibilities can be combined with 0, 1, 2, or 3 bulbs. Hence there are 4*4 = 16 possible combinations of which one, namely (0,0), means that no bulb is on. There remain fifteen (not seven) ways of operating the lamps.
[06:57:14] <newpy> I don't see why there is only one combination that means no bulb is on
[06:57:45] <newpy> wouldn't (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3) all mean no bulb is on?
[06:58:09] <newpy> and maybe also (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)?
[07:00:07] <Z-module> when they so "no bulb", they mean absolutely none: not one of the 3 ordinary ones, nor the indirect thing
[07:00:22] <PlanckWalk> I've heard of 3-way bulbs, but not 7-way lamps
[07:00:47] <Z-module> this is really a 3-bulb device, plus a 3-way separate "indirect" lamp to go with those
[07:00:54] <newpy> Z-module, oh wait so one integer refers to the setting of the indirect lamp
[07:01:03] <newpy> and the second integer referrs to the number of bulbs on the main lamp which are on?
[07:01:06] <Z-module> apparently
[07:01:26] <newpy> that makes sense
[07:01:26] <Z-module> the thing is, you'd hope that ANY subset of the 3 main bulbs could be on at once
[07:01:46] <PlanckWalk> So there are really 4 bulbs?  3 normal and 1 indirect that has 3 brightness settings?
[07:02:09] <Z-module> sounds like it
[07:02:12] <newpy> PlanckWalk, I think so, it's supposed to be a basic example going over elementary combinatorics
[07:02:14] <Z-module> it's really not very clearly described
[07:02:18] <PlanckWalk> To be honest when I read "indirect lighting fixture" I though it was a refector or diffuser or something.
[07:02:28] <PlanckWalk> Not another bulb
[07:02:30] <Z-module> could be
[07:02:32] <newpy> the previous example was 4 suites * 13 faces = 52 cards
[07:02:52] <newpy> I don't think I was supposed to actually look too deeply into it
[07:03:26] <PlanckWalk> Maybe it was something common in the author's social setting but isn't to us?
[07:03:39] <newpy> possibly, I think Feller wrote it in the 60's
[07:03:44] <Z-module> could be

[11:01:21] <Capso> PlanckWalk: eh, I was overcounting as 1 - G, so uniformly, and I need something tighter than that

[11:03:07] <Capso> PlanckWalk: but I kind of need to know when both, M and N are growing... so this M(M + 1) bound is nice like that: it tells me that the trade-off is only quadratic
[11:03:18] <PlanckWalk> E.g. for m = M-3, the sequence has exactly 4 values.  That's more annoying than counting at most 4 values.

[13:10:50] <PlanckWalk> Fangs: Proving that the limit is inf is very similar to proving that the limit is some real number.
[13:11:26] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: how so?
[13:11:32] <Fangs> I thought you prove the negation
[13:11:34] <PlanckWalk> Just instead of |f(z) - L| < eps  you're showing |f(x)| > eps
[13:11:48] <PlanckWalk> (Except it's common to use something like M instead of eps)
[13:12:13] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: what you get to choose gets revered no?
[13:12:19] <PlanckWalk> No
[13:12:44] <PlanckWalk> Formally it is exactly like any other limit proof except that your metric is different
[13:14:02] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: you're saying this is wrong?
[13:14:02] <PlanckWalk> For all M there exists d such that 0 < |z-z0| < d implies |f(z)| > M
[13:14:13] <PlanckWalk> Fangs: Negating a limit proof is wrong, yes
[13:14:20] <Fangs> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xJ2HhfOk/order.jpg
[13:15:03] <PlanckWalk> Yep, that's no good
[13:15:25] <Fangs> I'm not entirely convinced
[13:15:28] <Fangs> oh
[13:15:29] <rubiksdream> that is negating 'for all z_0 \in C, lim_{z -> z_0} f(z) exists'
[13:15:43] <PlanckWalk> That one would be true for a finite step function
[13:15:44] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: take R instead of C
[13:15:50] <Fangs> sin(1/x)
[13:15:56] <Fangs> limit as x -> 0 does not exists
[13:16:07] <Fangs> so I *should* be able to prove the negation of limit exists
[13:16:09] <PlanckWalk> Yes, oscillation is another case
[13:16:18] <PlanckWalk> You can prove it sure.  It's just not what you want.
[13:16:19] <Fangs> but I wouldn't be able to prove that f(x) -> oo
[13:16:55] <Fangs> yeah I'm rusty so whenever someone say something I want to be able to come up with an explicit confirmation or a counterexample
[13:17:17] <rubiksdream> you want to prove a limit exists for z_0 = infinity , but what is written there is exactly the negation of 'for all z_0 \in C, lim_{z -> z_0} f(z) exists'
[13:17:20] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: so sin(1/x) should support your statement that I want to prove another thing, not the negation
[13:17:22] <rubiksdream> im not sure how the two are connected
[13:17:46] <PlanckWalk> Right
[13:17:53] <Fangs> rubiksdream: I'm taking the limit as x -> 0, not 1/x -> 0
[13:18:05] <Fangs> (so I can give a concrete 'witness' for PlanckWalk 's statement)
[13:18:12] <PlanckWalk> You can explicitly put a metric on  C u {inf}  such that the |f|->inf property is actually a metric space limit.
[13:18:25] <Fangs> what's the metric?
[13:18:27] <rubiksdream> ah okay, so you want to show lim_{z -> 0} 1/z = infinity in C U {inf}
[13:18:42] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: I was just going to work with 2 charts w and z with w = 1/z as the transition functions
[13:18:48] <rubiksdream> you can just take the spherical metric
[13:18:59] <Fangs> ?????? what the fuck is this metric lol
[13:19:02] <rubiksdream> but the metric is not important here
[13:19:11] <rubiksdream> you should take this as a definition
[13:19:16] <rubiksdream> rather than worry about metrics (at the moment)
[13:19:25] <Fangs> ok
[13:19:44] <Fangs> rubiksdream: still trying to show that (az+b)/(cz+d) -> oo as z -> -d/c
[13:20:16] <rubiksdream> so what you want to show is that the modulus of that thing tends to positive infinity
[13:20:19] <rubiksdream> as z -> -d/c
[13:20:29] <rubiksdream> that is what you should take as the definition of 'tends to infinity'
[13:21:10] <rubiksdream> and as you've probably reduced the problem down to, it amounts to showing the same thing for 1/z, as z->0
[13:21:30] <Fangs> you think way too highly of me
[13:21:44] <rubiksdream> well i just suspected thats why you were interested in 1/z to begin with

[13:22:32] <Fangs> (also I needed a small victory lol)
[13:23:01] <rubiksdream> well you can do as follows : (az+b) = (a/c)(cz + d) + const.
[13:23:15] <rubiksdream> then your expression becomes (a/c) + const / (cz+d)
[13:23:33] <rubiksdream> and now you're basically dealing with 1/c

[14:08:31] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: but if you write z = z_0 + (z - z_0), and set z- z_0 to be eta

[14:09:12] <Fangs> (I think I'm doing that "taylor expansion at z_0" trick but I can't confirm)
[14:09:44] <Fangs> the idea is z_0 is where things blow up, and I very much rather work "near" z_0 and look at z_0 + something small
[14:10:51] <Fangs> Millenial's trick was to show c f(z) -> oo, that c there lets you factorize everything into 1 + cosntant/(cz+d) or something to that effect

[14:48:23] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: what gives you |f(z)| > eps though?
[14:48:45] <Fangs> can you do this to any non-compact metric space X with its one point compactification?

[14:49:22] <Fangs> which part? don't worry too much about the second part

[14:50:47] <Fangs> "18:49 <rubiksdream> you should take this as a definition" that's unecessary then
[14:51:16] <PlanckWalk> But if you wanted to do it all nicely as a complete metric space then the Riemann sphere is probably easiest
[14:52:03] <PlanckWalk> Then when you translate the "converges to inf" epsilon-delta statement, you get that after some simplification.

[14:52:38] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: I might try to do that explicitly tomorrow if my other classes arent already killing me

[14:58:32] <buster> the other kind, an inner product on each tangent space, smoothly varying
[14:58:57] <Fangs> buster: yes, I was asking about the metric metric, not a connection metric
[14:59:05] <Fangs> I don't know if my choice of charts gives me a metric metric either tbh
[14:59:17] <PlanckWalk> You can use the Riemannian metric to get a metric space metric.
[14:59:32] <PlanckWalk> Just pick the length of the shortest geodesic.
[14:59:38] <Fangs> that requires you to measure things via great circles and integrate the metric along those geodesic
[14:59:40] <Fangs> *shudders*
[15:00:08] <PlanckWalk> Yes, which is okay in this case because it's just the angle.
[15:00:29] <PlanckWalk> And you're measuring angle to the north pole.
[15:01:13] <buster> Fangs, you only need a topology to do limits, if you don't mind translating the epsilon-delta proof into one about open sets
[15:01:46] <Fangs> buster: I want to know why the correct definition for "lim z -> c f(z) = oo" is the following
[15:01:53] <Franciman> limits are basically related to closed sets
[15:01:56] <buster> (https://archive.org/details/groupsgeometry0000neum/page/210/mode/2up)
[15:01:56] <Fangs> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FnroUm14/infty.jpg
[15:02:20] <Fangs> buster: oh btw negating the definition of limit doesn't mean lim f(z) -> oo btw
[15:02:32] <Franciman> if you have a succession {a_n} its limits are in the closure of the set { a_n : n \in N }
[15:02:33] <PlanckWalk> But the main part is just  d(w, inf) in this metric is monotonic in |w|
[15:02:34] <Fangs> buster: here's an example: take x -> 0 of sin(1/x)
[15:03:00] <Fangs> you can show this satisfy the negation we were working with, but we wouldn't be able to show that it satisfies the definition for sin(1/x) -> oo
[15:03:01] <PlanckWalk> monotonic decreasing
[15:03:17] <rubiksdream> Fangs because a neighbourhood basis of infinite consists of sets of the form {|z| > M } , for increasing M
[15:03:40] <rubiksdream> if you work with the topology of the one point compactification, you see that this translates directly into the 'definition' I said you can work with
[15:03:43] <rubiksdream> they are one in the same
[15:03:46] <rubiksdream> no need for any metrics
[15:03:53] <rubiksdream> *infinity
[15:04:22] <Fangs> ok I'm happier with that. so that goes back to the "working with two charts" I mentioned earlier
[15:04:28] <PlanckWalk> Yes, you can skip the metric really. I just mentioned it since it's actually fairly neat in this case.
[15:04:43] <Fangs> that just makes me curious what the metric "is"
[15:04:47] <rubiksdream> what do you mean working with two charts?
[15:04:52] <rubiksdream> you don't even need to consider charts
[15:05:05] <PlanckWalk> Just like the one-point compactification of R can be given the metric of a circle.

[15:05:38] <rubiksdream> you need only look at a neighbourhood basis of infinity

[15:08:21] <rubiksdream> the topology on C U {infinity} (and any one point compactification of an appropriate space) is as follows, T_C u {(C \setminus V} U {infinity} : V \subset C compact}

[15:17:16] <buster> Fangs, that inversive geometry chapter describes the metric-space metric induced on the Riemann sphere by stereographic projection, explicitly
[15:18:19] <rubiksdream> yeah thats fine, ultimately you can specify the topology on a space by specifying charts that turn it into a manifold, kinda what you are doing, because you can just say (C , z|->z) and (C* \setminus {0} , 1/z) are two charts, and the transition functions are holomorphic (so obviously smooth), and there is a unique topology on C U {infinity} that accomodates these charts forming an atlas for the space

[15:20:01] <Fangs> even then, I'm not entirely sure these charts are kosher

[15:51:28] <Capso> PlanckWalk: but isn't it true that if we fix N and let M vary, then (1 - G/N^M)*N < M(M+1)?
[15:51:49] <Capso> PlanckWalk: G = N * (N - 1) * ... * (N - M - 1)
[15:52:46] <PlanckWalk> Oh I see what you mean now
[15:53:17] <PlanckWalk> If you fix N and let M vary, then eventually M > N
[15:53:22] <Capso> N^M - G = #all things with some repetition
[15:53:25] <PlanckWalk> So then G = 0
[15:55:24] <Capso> PlanckWalk: true, so in that sense looking at the normalized rate maybe is only interesting for letting N grow
[15:56:18] <PlanckWalk> You can let both N and M grow along some trajectory
[15:57:39] <Capso> but the bound N^M - G < M(M+1) N^(M-1) still seems better than N^(M-1) (M-1)^M that you would be getting from what you said, at least in that pre-factor of M, which is quadratic for me and like factorial for you

[16:07:39] <Capso> so it's < N^(M-m) * (M-m)^M/(M-m)!
[16:09:16] <PlanckWalk> Yes, when you divide that by N^M to get a ratio, it goes like N^-m
[16:10:15] <Capso> ah there's not even a quadratic factor of M(M+1) there then
[16:10:41] <tolarz> in a lattice-ordered group, does join(e, e) = e hold?
[16:10:59] <PlanckWalk> I'm just talking about asymptotic behaviour in N here, for fixed M and m
[16:11:04] <tolarz> nvm lattice ops are idempotent
[16:11:05] <PlanckWalk> Your buond goes like 1/N
[16:11:46] <PlanckWalk> Mine does that only for m=1.
[16:12:25] <Capso> PlanckWalk: yes, but my bound holds also for asymptotic in M with m and N fixed. I guess yours does too?
[16:12:44] <PlanckWalk> Which makes sense, as the number of possible values increases the chance of multiple being re-used drops faster than the chance of only one being re-used.
[16:13:07] <PlanckWalk> So for large N compared with M, the m=1 term dominates
[16:14:17] <PlanckWalk> So your bound will be tighter for m=1, mine tighter for m>1

[16:51:19] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[16:51:58] <rubiksdream> its a well known fact (by koebe) that any subset of C - {a,b} is covered by the unit disk (is hyperbolic), the proof isn't easy but this is an easier fact than the uniformisation theorem for arbitrary riemann surfaces (this is only about planar regions)
[16:52:06] <rubiksdream> *any connected open
[16:52:45] <rubiksdream> what that means is that if you have a nonconstant map f : C -> C - {a,b}, it admits a lift to the unit disk and this lift is holomorphic, but by liouville, this lift must be constant, so f was constant

[16:54:59] <rubiksdream> otherwise if you are only considering nonconstant maps of connected + compact riemann surfaces, these maps always need to be surjective
[16:55:07] <rubiksdream> for this all you need is the open mapping theorem
[16:55:53] <rubiksdream> e.g. if X , Y are connected compact RS's, and f : X -> Y is nonconstant, f(X) is clopen in Y , it is closed because X is compact, and its open by the open-mapping theorem, hence f(X) = Y

[16:59:15] <rubiksdream> so for this latter result, the open mapping theorem is crucial , and my intuition for the open mapping theorem is that up to a change of holomorphic coordinates, nonconstant holomorphic maps are powering maps
[16:59:27] <rubiksdream> i.e. z |-> z^n for some integer n, and powering maps are open (easy to prove this directly)
[17:00:12] <Z-module> connectedness + compactness together is powerful. Such as in the very obscure fact that if f:R^n -> R^n  (any natural n) is any function, then f is continuous   iff   f preserves connectedness on all sets and f preserves compactness on all sets.
[17:00:17] <rubiksdream> its pretty easy to see this , and n is the order of your map about the point you're changing coordinates

[17:06:53] <rubiksdream> yeah, even the little picard theorem must have been cool to notice
[17:09:02] <Z-module> quite a contrast: If f is a nonconstant polynomial function on C, it assumes every complex value (no exceptions), at most deg(f) times each.l  If f is transcendental entire, it assumes every value infinitely often, with one possible exceptional value that can be assumed any of 0, 1, 2, ..., aleph_0 many times.

[21:05:37] <tolarz> Question!
[21:05:51] <tolarz> What's the intuition that taking inverses flips the order sign?
[21:05:57] <tolarz> e.g. 3 <= 4    and -3 >= -4
[21:06:12] <buster> um. the number line
[21:06:16] <tolarz> Can I somehow determine this syntactically?
[21:06:52] <tolarz> I am considering lattice-ordered groups. These objects have an order (like <= above) and inverses from the groups (like - for Z above)
[21:07:01] <tolarz> There, a <= b implies a⁻¹ >= b⁻¹
[21:07:02] <savask> tolarz: a <= b implies a-b <= 0 implies -b <= -a implies -a >= -b
[21:07:30] <tolarz> I'd like to know why this is the case
[21:07:46] <tolarz> from a universal algebra perspective, i.e., from the POV where you only consider signatures , operations, and their arity.
[21:08:08] <savask> Doesn't what I wrote count as a "syntactic" proof, though
[21:08:14] <rubiksdream> maybe there is an analogue of: a <= b -> a+c <= b+c for any c?
[21:08:21] <rubiksdream> in that case what was just written is the proof
[21:08:41] <tolarz> savask: it's semantic because you used that you can rearrange the inequalit
[21:08:44] <tolarz> y
[21:08:55] <tolarz> with signatures, operations, arity only you wouldn't know this to be possible
[21:09:10] <rubiksdream> not really rearranging, you can just say he used the + operation and did + (-b) to both sides

[21:10:18] <rubiksdream> it would be a deprecated use, right, since c <= c
[21:10:21] <tolarz> It takes two such signatures and produces a "morphed" one
[21:10:23] <rubiksdream> or maybe that doesnt hold
[21:10:28] <tolarz> Morph(Lattice, Group) = Lattice-Ordered groups
[21:10:51] <tolarz> Problem being that inverses in groups flip <= ...
[21:11:06] <tolarz> whlie the binary group operation doesn't flip (a <= a', b <= b'   implies a + b <= a' + b')
[21:11:43] <rubiksdream> so we can safely get to b^{-1} <= a^{-1}
[21:11:45] <loopspace> You could maybe look at it in terms of Galois connections (order reversing functors amongst preorders)

[21:54:52] <Guest49> I understand. Thank you
[21:56:35] <W> Guest49, a frequency shifted (in the way buster outlined) signal will just have its Fourier transform shifted too
[21:57:19] <W> as far as sound, this may be bad or good, but mathematically, it's not anything special
[21:59:19] *** Quits: foobaz212 (~foobaz212@82.33.219.124) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[21:59:29] <Guest49> right thats exactly what I am thinking
[21:59:31] <Guest49> okay
[22:00:08] <W> very rare that a signal is frequency shifted this way in the time domain though, a shift there is likely to be a pitch up or down (multiplying the time by a factor), and if you want a frequency shift, you typically do that *after* a Fourier transform
[22:00:43] <Guest49> I don't care about time shifting.
[22:00:52] <W> (specifically because it's just a simple addition to the frequency there)
[22:01:12] <Guest49> Apparently in the real world, a signal is likely to be frequency shifted
[22:01:50] <W> that doesn't sound right, but what's the source?
[22:02:03] <Guest49> Why doesn't it sound right?
[22:02:11] *** Joins: foobaz212 (~foobaz212@82.33.219.124)
[22:02:23] <Guest49> like, radio signals
[22:03:11] <W> well like buster suggested, a frequency shift changes all the harmonics; two notes that sounded pleasant together, or a chord that is normally harmonic, will most likely be discordant when shifted

[22:04:19] <W> radio signals don't frequency shift anything, they modulate one signal with another

[22:05:21] <W> (in a great variety of ways, some of which I guess involve frequency shifting the *carrier wave* signal)
[22:06:14] <W> if you do a Fourier transform of an FM signal, you will see that the peak(s) move up and down the frequency, and it's this movement that has the real signal (e.g. audio)
[22:06:42] <Guest49> Oh, I think I have misunderstood what I was being told I am sorry.

[22:07:43] <Guest49> I am told that a radio receiver listens to a specific band "centered at zero". Then when it hears a signal come in, but it is ~offset~ from the desired frequency...
[22:07:54] <W> yeah, that's FM
[22:09:16] <W> in that case, the frequency shifting's discordant effects isn't bad (in fact it may be good in that it lowers interference with harmonic radio frequencies), and does not affect (because it *encodes*) the audio signal
[22:09:36] <Guest49> so can we linearly shift the incoming signal frequency and then take the FT ?
[22:09:49] <W> yep

[22:49:38] <W> Speaking of signal processing, you can use two (or more) different filters on a signal, in parallel, but how would you combine the outputs to filter out what gets through one filter but not the other(s)? I mean, mathematically, I guess Fourier transform, geometric average, inverse Fourier? Is there better? And does this have a name?
