[02:04:11] <phogg> wauterboi: but it's true that if I edit the raster data on a layer the only way back is undo. Filters (scripts) are also typically applied by generating a static layer, so you can't keep fiddling the parameters and see the changes live
[02:04:15] <wauterboi> That's not what I was suggesting. A non-destructive edit means I can apply something like a blur while still editing the layer affected by that blur.

[05:29:16] <Lopyt> Good day, how would I format a second hard drive to my computer so I don't have to mount it and get root access in the file manager each time I open it. With USB Flash drives I was having an issue where when formatted to ext# the USB required root access to edit any files on it; was read only. Will that be the same with a mechanical HDD Hard Disk Drive?

[06:56:23] <NeilRG> I was really hoping for something simpler than reinstall
[06:56:26] <Affliction> Best to leave deletion of stuff in /usr to the package manager.
[06:56:39] <rbox> NeilRG: restore your backup is the simple solution
[06:56:45] <NeilRG> I did do a "find . | grep "cuda"" before deleting and it looked like it was all documentation files

[10:01:41] <mlu> yeah, it solves the problem if you can't walk or something, but seriously... for most people, there's less risk of running over toddlers or destroying stuff if they just walked

[12:19:52] <lopid> your window manager, or check vimrc/gvimrc
[12:20:10] <wyclif> NeilRG: Basically, you have to change `gvim <parameter(s)>`
[12:20:32] <geirha> For me, it usually opens with the same width and height (in characters) as the terminal emulater I run it from
[12:20:33] <NeilRG> wyclif, what do you mean?
[12:20:40] <wyclif> Try this:
[12:20:45] <wyclif> `gvim -geometry 500x500`
[12:20:47] <NeilRG> geirha, not vim, gvim
[12:21:03] <NeilRG> wyclif, still opens maximized
[12:21:04] <redstart> maybe you can find it's .desktop file and modifiy the command
[12:21:08] <geirha> yes, I am talking about gvim. If my terminal emulator is 80x24, the gvim window is also 80x24
[12:21:15] <NeilRG> geirha, it is not
[12:21:22] <wyclif> Because gvim understands the `geometry` parameter (or is supposed to)
[12:21:41] <NeilRG> it's always opening maximized, the terminal is not maximized

[12:23:04] <wyclif> Also, you can edit your ~/.vimrc
[12:23:05] <geirha> and if that makes the window larger than the screen, it opens maximized instead. But your config may be different, of course
[12:23:31] <redstart> NeilRG, I think it should be in /usr/share/applications/
[12:23:34] <wyclif> You could open your ~/.vimrc and add these lines:
[12:23:38] <wyclif> `if has("gui_running") " GUI is running or is about to start. " Maximize gvim window. set lines=999 columns=999
[12:23:41] <wyclif> endif`
[12:23:48] <NeilRG> wyclif, my vimrc doesn't have anything that maximizes.  In fact, I'm explicitly setting "lines" and "columns" to try to achieve a startup, but it's ruined by the maximization that ubuntu is doing
[12:24:01] <NeilRG> wyclif, I want it to *not* be maximized
[12:24:18] <wyclif> You are right that this is a problem unique to Ubuntu. Other distros just use the default gvim settings
[12:25:12] <wyclif> NeilRG: Have you tried this? https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Maximize_or_set_initial_window_size

[12:26:01] *** Joins: kaiseisei (~Thunderbi@user/kaiseisei)
[12:26:17] <wyclif> You can un-comment the lines that maximize it
[12:26:28] <wyclif> And just change it to unmaximize gvim
[12:26:39] <redstart> NeilRg, open it up and change the exec line to use the --geometry flag
[12:27:02] <redstart> -geometry*
[12:27:15] <wyclif> Like I said, gvim does understand geo parameters and will start it at what size it thinks you expect. Right now because you're on Ubuntu it thinks you want it maxiized on launch
[12:27:28] <geirha> but the desktop file is not used when starting it from a terminal emulator

Where could I look to find out where this is coming from? dmesg? I looked and I saw audit: type=1400 audit(1648180857.629:107): apparmor="DENIED" operation="open" profile="/usr/sbin/cupsd" name="/proc/1/environ" pid=122849 comm="cupsd" [...]

[18:43:54] <phogg> you might get two or three at most, but more than one is incredibly uncommon
