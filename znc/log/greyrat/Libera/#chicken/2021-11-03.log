[01:49:36] <foggynight> Hey, question about the optimization flags and compilation units: I have a global unit that has some variables which are used in the other units of my program and can be modified by the parser of the program using "CONF directives", would using -O3 be unsafe as the toplevel definitions of the global unit could be modified by the parser unit? (My guess is yes it is unsafe.) And would moving those
[01:49:39] <foggynight> global variables to the parser unit avoid this unsafe-ness? (Won't be doing this but wondering for future reference.)
[01:52:36] <wasamasa> use parameters
[01:55:28] <foggynight> Ah nice I think I will do that thanks.

[11:38:55] <alaricsp> Ugh... it's complicated. Not great, and there has been much drama because there's also a local COVID outbreak so the hospital has been... different. SO she's now home with us (I picked her up late yesterday evening) but she can't get up the stairs to her bed or anything so it's all a bit nuts; this morning we're going to ring adult social services and say "We can't cope" and see what can be done
