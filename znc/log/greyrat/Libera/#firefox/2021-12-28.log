[21:47:57] <perrierjouet> ede it's this url I want to block the link is "https://imgur.com/a/2PvplIC" it look like this https://imgur.com/a/2PvplIC
[21:48:33] <perrierjouet> sorry the add link I want to block is "https://leon.fun/casino-ca/?qtag=a27518_t27774_c183_s" is it possible to add this url in ublock ?
[21:49:06] <perrierjouet> on that site ublock says 1% blocked
[21:52:27] <ede> i have some of these sites in my hosts file again, but then DoH isn't a thing for me
[21:53:01] <perrierjouet> doh ?
[21:53:15] <perrierjouet> ede: you use unbound ?
[21:53:41] <ede> just a temporary profile
[21:54:26] <ede> and i prefer firefox to not be able to connect at all instead of running some JS in an addon and check the list all the time

[22:11:50] <perrierjouet> ede: how you prevent ff connecting to a specific site
[22:11:52] <perrierjouet> ?
[22:13:42] <ede> perrierjouet: no relevant addons right now. normally it's noscript for years now and later i added ubo. not running scripts prevents a lot of load actions already.
[22:13:51] <ede> and then hosts
[22:14:42] <ede> the problem usually isn't clicking the wrong link, but all the crap that comes with a page opened.
[22:15:53] <ede> some day i'll run pihole i hope or something similar.

[22:46:37] <rapha> since a few days ago, even with all tabs closed and all addons uninstalled, my firefox uses 107% CPU ... have i been hacked and how can i find out?
[22:49:07] <ede> rapha: check with a new profile (temporary one is enough)
[22:50:18] <ede> also, what OS? malware check, comparing the files to a fresh download?
[23:05:28] <rapha> ede: Linux, nothing in the process list looking weird except for 9 firefox processes, which seems a bit much for no tabs open and no website rendered.
[23:06:47] <ede> definitely. my CPU is at 5-7% most of the time now
[23:07:44] <ede> rapha: is a a distro package or upstream?
[23:16:28] <rapha> ede: it's a distro package. creating a new profile in the profile manager did help. i figure i'll just connect it to Sync again and be done with it.
[23:16:59] <rapha> also down to 6 processes with no open tabs
[23:17:07] <ede> rapha: so i'd say some of your files in the profiles may be damaged
[23:17:23] <ede> i have TWO of them in some backup waiting to be revived
[23:18:09] <ede> while i tried it on this machine the only effect was full load for half an hour and longer including hexchat (also gtk) disconnecting all the time
[23:18:45] <ede> rapha: htop is a nice tool, you could sort by cpu and then check the greedy process for open files
[23:21:04] <rapha> ede: after connecting to Mozilla Sync i'm back to trouble land :(

[23:24:46] <rapha> so you think that it would be possible by looking at the process list to identify what part of firefox is the problem?

[23:27:24] <rapha> hmm, ok, now after uninstalling all extensions, i'm down to 45% CPU without anything open

[23:28:02] <rapha> oh, it just dropped to normal levels. perhaps the sync was still ongoing.
[23:28:28] <rapha> i'll install ublock origin again (even though it seems to not be working as well anymore as it used to) and stay away form all other extensions for now

[23:44:12] <ede> rapha: i never looked into "which process is which window", but sometimes a process disappeared when i left a site.
[23:44:26] <ede> 45% is still too much
[23:45:30] <ede> yeah, i hate it also when it starts doing something on the disk
