[00:00:28] <phogg> schuelermine: the short story is that this is *probably* not going to work on just about any initd, unless it happens to run *really fast*. You are basically racing against the "terminate all processes" step.

[00:00:53] <schuelermine> Psi-Jack: I want to save some data that gets saved to /tmp. I *could* make a cronjob, but that’s unreliable here because I might shut down before it runs and it’s not really necessary to do it constantly
[00:01:16] <blackgatonegro> Yeah dude, just do the usual "Shutdown after doing X"
[00:01:22] <Khaytsus> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/39226/how-to-run-a-script-with-systemd-right-before-shutdown
[00:01:24] <phogg> theoretically one could have a system designed to wait on a shutdown-time event to *complete* before continuing shutdown, but it is infinitely more wise not to voluntarily create potential "my shutdown just hung" scenarios.

[00:07:00] <schuelermine> blackgatonegro: no, I don’t have power problems
[00:07:06] <phogg> schuelermine: there is a command line tool called inotifywait(1)
[00:07:07] <schuelermine> it’s all fine manually doing it, just tedious
[00:07:16] <blackgatonegro> Then why do you want backup before shutdown?
[00:07:21] <schuelermine> pah ok
[00:07:24] <phogg> schuelermine: you may have to install inotify-tools (Debian)

[00:08:15] <schuelermine> Asciinema saves to /tmp if the cast is not uploaded.

[03:25:28] <bparker> they are improving much faster than most distros ever update it
[03:25:34] <r4smus> then the second it gets to loading screen it insta crashes

[05:11:26] <webstrand> I've seen some behavior in strace where it seems to try every path in PATH, but I'm not sure if that's always the case. There's an execv syscall, which may read the PATH in the kernel?

[06:25:12] <rascul> systemctl stop minecraft.service
[06:25:21] <rascul> substitute minecraft with whatever the service is called
[06:25:31] <Plazey> That kills it without sending stop to the service itself.

[06:26:32] <Plazey> When you run the minecraft server normally, it runs in the foreground and you're able to send it commands to do different things.
[06:26:47] <Plazey> One of those commands is stop, which safely shuts down the server.

[06:27:14] <[[R]]> you can't just send random stuff to stdin when its running under systemd
[06:27:45] <Plazey> When you run it as a service, the service sends a interrupt and the program ends without being shutdown properly.
[06:27:49] <Plazey> No?
[06:27:58] <Plazey> I was hoping you could do it with ExecStop or something.

[09:05:06] <hans> matsaman, SPF was 2014-ish, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework

[11:21:02] <kstar> /var/tmp is something I'll think about.
[11:21:55] <hexnewbie> Every program that stores non-volatile data *can* write part of that data to /tmp (that includes simple things like pipes through 'sort'), and have it end up on your unencrypted / filesystem if not tmpfs
[11:21:56] <kstar> What exactly is /var/tmp? Never understood. /var is persistent right? It's within the root fs in typical Linux setups.
[11:22:30] *** Joins: colo (~colo@user/colo)

[11:22:59] <Dagmar> it's for programs that are generally running as root htat don't have time to screw around with playing with race conditions. and need to store some data away from where users can tamper with it
[11:23:01] <kstar> hexnewbie: I think I can live with that risk. I have a setup elsewhere that has encryption on /tmp and manually clearing a persistent /tmp is a pain.

[11:23:46] <hexnewbie> tmpfs does not need to be encrypted, it lives in RAM
[11:23:53] <hexnewbie> well, unless you have swap
[11:24:00] <kstar> CoolerX: Yes, should be editable in the config to disallow key authentication
[11:24:15] <CoolerX> kstar, no no
[11:24:18] <CoolerX> I mean temporarily
[11:24:23] <CoolerX> I have the username password
[11:24:28] <schillingklaus> does tmpfs go to disk when hibernating?

[11:24:40] <CoolerX> just want to login real quick
[11:24:42] <kstar> CoolerX: That depends on the server config. If the server does not allow password, the client cannot be overriden.
[11:24:57] <CoolerX> ok
[11:25:01] <CoolerX> how do I test it?
[11:25:06] <kstar> CoolerX: But if the client allows for password, I'm not sure how to do it, but it should be possible.

[17:13:39] <Kyv> All emoji fonts deserve to be boycotted.
[17:13:45] <schillingklaus> only a non-digitalized manifesto
[17:13:52] <Kyv> You can choose between the google one, the microsoft one, the adobe one or the mozilla one.
[17:14:00] <msiism> schillingklaus: You would probably be better off making a list of things you don't boycott. :-P
[17:14:03] <hexnewbie> One mildly annoying thing is that something in GTK land (Pango?) is replacing the preferred font's glyph with a colour emoji, which breaks Inkscape. I want to use an ambulance symbol from a vector font in my Inkscape drawing, but since something forces a colour emoji, Inkscape does not render any ambulance
[17:14:07] <NGC3982> Kyv: ..on irc, perhaps.
[17:14:10] <NGC3982> emojis have their place
[17:14:20] <_methods> 🍆
[17:14:30] <TJ-> hexnewbie: really? that sounds extremely weird
[17:14:51] <TJ-> hexnewbie: which vector font? I use inkscape extensively
[17:14:53] <NGC3982> and opposing emojis in all scripture would probably be a tad antiquated
[17:15:22] <Kyv> NGC3982: if you need a gimped means of expression, dictated by the unicode consortium, in place of comprising your thoughts more concisely, sure.
[17:15:34] <NGC3982> we do

[17:17:13] <djph> msiism: it doesn't take 400 character presses to type, and isn't the new hip way of sending a smile, so it must be rejected.

[17:17:15] <NGC3982> :D.
[17:17:33] <Psi-Jack> It's funny that people say that, Because the "icon" part of emoticon suggests an... icon. Which you know, is a graphical representation of something.

[17:17:46] <r4smus> :( :) :o will never get old

[20:17:15] <jim> there's another program called ssh-agent, which you start on the local machine, and it continues to run... it uses pairs of key and passphrase, and when you ssh to somewhere needing that key, it sends what it has
[20:17:34] <Psi-Jack> Hence... my earlier question.
[20:17:44] <jim> with the effect, that when you ssh, you don't have to supply a passphrase
