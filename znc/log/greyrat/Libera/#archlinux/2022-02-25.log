[03:25:41] <jotoho> Scimmia: Depending on if the personalities share memories, perhaps cloud storage with a password only one personality knows would have been the answer.

[03:40:22] <aephos> I'm new to Arch and have a simple question: does the base kernel package provide all kernel modules or do I need to build them myself? Specifically, my XBox controller is not working and modprobe xpad can't find a module.

[03:41:15] <Scimmia> aephos: it has a whole lot of modules, but there are some that don't live in the tree
[03:41:18] <AlexC> it will work with wired mode
[03:41:30] <AlexC> if you plugin the controller, will work, but not wireless
[03:41:46] <aephos> I did plug it in. It shows up in lsusb, but doesn't work.

[03:42:02] <aephos> On https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Gamepad, it says "Both the wired and wireless (with the Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows) controllers are supported by the xpad kernel module and should work without additional packages."
[03:42:26] <aephos> I'm using a wired Xbox 360 controller.

[05:17:59] <switchnode> there are no other files in /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tests/, and based on my googling (especially https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14454744/does-it-make-sense-to-install-my-python-unit-tests-in-site-packages) it seems like both python packages _accidentally_ include a 'tests' module through the same oversight in setuptools configuration.
[05:18:00] <phrik> Title: Does it make sense to install my Python unit tests in site-packages? - Stack Overflow (at stackoverflow.com)
[05:18:03] <switchnode> er.
[05:18:19] <switchnode> that should have been preceded by:
[05:18:27] <switchnode> while trying to install https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-spotdl, i ran into a 'conflicting files' error: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tests/__init__.py (and its corresponding .pyc files) already exists and is owned by another python module (https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) i packaged for my own use (PKGBUILD http://ix.io/3QFq).
[05:20:58] <switchnode> am i right in thinking that the correct way to address this is to take it upstream in both cases? if so, is there a good way to remove the offending files in the PKGBUILD, for the meantime?

[07:05:43] <feinedsquirrel> The arch wiki article on python venvs mentions "bash" as an example for activation. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Python/Virtual_environment#Activation I've looked through the activation script, and though it seems it should be compatible with zsh, the top line says "This file must be used with "source bin/activate" *from bash*". The python docs suggest the activate script should be bash/zsh ..

[10:09:11] <mpan> jayache80: because you are supposed to properly maintain your system, including updating often, and pacman is not a tool to remove breakage the administrator has themselves introduced.
[10:10:03] <jayache80> so my quantum was 3 months, but can't that quantum be tiny, like days, or minutes, where the same keyring issue can occur?
[10:10:16] <mpan> No
[10:11:03] <thurstylark> there's been a heavier-than-normal churn in that keyring recently as well
[10:11:43] <jayache80> Ok. what is the typical maximum amount of time one could go without updating before they'd expect that kind of issue?
[10:12:07] <mpan> There is none specific, but I would not update more rarely than a week.
[10:12:14] <mpan> once a week*
[10:12:22] <mpan> Though for security reasons even that is risky.
[10:12:32] <thurstylark> a month is usually when I'd really be looking out for things to break on update

[10:32:22] <mpan> jayache80: if you’re worried about having to deal with breakage too often (which doesn’t happen as often as people imagine), a better approach is to learn how to unbreak your system quickly. Rolling back — either manually or using ALA — is quite painless. And then you do not have worries anymore.

[10:34:21] <mpan> jayache80: postponing updates may cause trouble worse than simple “expected” issues. The news section of Arch website refers to the current affairs and is likely to not be true in 3 months. The other way around: after 3 months packages may already blindly assume you applied that news guidances 3 montsh earlier. Post-install/update are expecting reasonably current state of the system. Any bug reports 
[10:34:27] <mpan> are about recent packages. And, finally, if something breaks… you will not get much help for a system 3 months old.
[10:34:50] <mpan> And there are a few other options, that are possible — though I do not list them, as those are only theoretically possible.

[12:24:19] <tatsumaru> hey guys, I just installed tagspaces and now when I press ctrl+shift+p in firefox, if tagspaces is opened it hijacks this keybinding and instead of private browsing it loads shifts the tagspaces window into view because in tagspaces ctrl+shift+p is a keybinding for Pause / Resume Playback. Unfortunately keybinding settings don't include this shortcut so I am not sure how I can disable it. any ideas?

[13:36:10] <kefko> archlinux documentainers! I am trying a little byte with the diffrent cap(s), termcap, keycap etc. Hence, i study the archlinux wiki howtos about xmodmap, xkbcomp, keymaps and so on... Maybe you have an interest in an new howto to summarize about the possiblitys between keymap and keycap, termcap and terminfo, terminal and xwindow, editor and font etc
[13:37:15] <kefko> then i would try to write a user friendly documentation about the current state of the keyboard handling in face of unicode.

[20:29:24] <TheArcaneBrony2> Looks like files got screwed over, reinstall is the only option
[20:29:34] <MacGyver> Don't be so hasty.

[20:32:40] <MacGyver> Whelp. Just reinstall the entire system then.
[20:32:47] <MacGyver> Hope most is in cache.
[20:33:19] <MacGyver> Oh uh.
[20:33:31] <TheArcaneBrony2> Everything is in cache
[20:33:40] <MacGyver> Of course you *can* also reinstall those packages that own /usr/share/libalpm.
[20:33:53] <MacGyver> So everything from pacman -Qkk and everything that owns a hook or a script.
[20:34:00] <MacGyver> Still probably saves you 90% of the reinstall.
