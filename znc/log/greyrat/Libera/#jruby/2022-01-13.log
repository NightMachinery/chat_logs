[21:48:17] <headius> enebo: that listen bug reproduced at first but when I turn log levels up I can see the notification
[21:48:36] <headius> debug mode shows it is polling and sees the file change, but anything lower than "warn" log level and I dont't see any output
[22:30:11] <headius> so far only two hangs running full fast specs on m1
[22:31:16] <headius> back on m1 work because that listen thing seems to be working but silent
[22:34:19] <headius> zero failures?
[22:34:32] * headius rolls for disbelief
[22:55:00] <enebo[m]> hahah
[22:55:31] <enebo[m]> pro-tip: Do not replace value & 0xffff with value % 0xffff
[22:55:56] <headius> close but no cigar
[22:56:47] <enebo[m]> What is amusing is that works quite well when your repro scripts are one-line long
