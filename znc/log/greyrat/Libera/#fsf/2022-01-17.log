However, I only use this type of protocol, to communicate with members of the free community and other very restricted, in my house we use WhatsApp (in Brazil it is popular), in my work, we use the email system provided by the federal government, if I am not mistaken,
[00:02:09] <Kaiod> proprietary too. In the rest, it's E-mail, Telegram and rarely XMPP.

[00:21:43] <jrmu> xmpp has nice mobile clients
[00:21:45] <jrmu> that's probably the best benefit

[00:22:05] <klys> or do you have to private message your client?
[00:22:06] <jrmu> you would not need an irc client if you used xmpp and bridged it to irc

[00:45:26] <klys> ewwegweg, I've been somewhat interested and bemused at the purported XML feature of such messaging.
[00:46:01] <klys> over the last day or two since we started talking about xmpp
[00:46:38] <jrmu> there's no way to send an XMPP message to IRC without a bridge, but we have a bridge on our network, and you could create a bridge with biboumi, if someone could help out we could provide servers for it
[00:46:54] <jrmu> it could be used to bridge to libera.chat, oftc, and elsewhere
[00:47:11] <ewwegweg> irc and xmpp. these are diffrent protocol
[00:47:34] <klys> and xmpp enables you to use XML?

[07:13:38] <DiffieHellman> The rx580 apparrently works under radeonsi without firmaware, but nonfree BIOS as well

[09:23:45] <tpefreedom> so which types of dedicated cards (manufacturer, time period/generation(s)) work best with linux-libre or other deblobbed kernels?
[09:24:36] <labrador_> tpefreedom, not a lot work.
[09:24:39] <labrador_> Like gpus
[09:24:49] <labrador_> You need firmware blobs
[09:25:49] <tpefreedom> Which semi-recent series (past decade or so) are the least bad then?
[09:26:30] <labrador_> well for gpus any recent amd one will work
[09:26:36] <labrador_> it has free drivers
[09:27:02] <labrador_> For cpus you need a very old <2006 cpu to escape blobs
[09:27:31] <tpefreedom> as in intel me/amd psp?
[09:28:08] <labrador_> yeah
[09:28:43] <tpefreedom> Also, for amd gpus is it like with nouveau where there is a major performance hit with using free drivers and firmware or do the features that work have performance comparable to nonfree drivers and firmware?
[09:29:16] <tpefreedom> bc afaik some features still don't work on recent amd cards w/o nonfree firmware and/or maybe nonfree drivers.
[09:33:11] <labrador_> Amd cards have full featured free drivers developed by amd themselves as amdgpu
[09:34:31] <tpefreedom> Do some features require blob firmware?
[09:34:34] <nckx> Which load the nonfree firmware.
[09:34:37] <nckx> Yes.
[09:35:21] <tpefreedom> But for the stuff thaht doesn't need the nonfree firmware, it gives yoou full performance
[09:35:32] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> @nckx oh ffs since when you are even in this channel
[09:35:35] * v1dl00fyuq6f[m] feels stalked
[09:35:51] <tpefreedom> too bad miners and scalpers are buying up everything.

[09:36:18] <nckx> v1dl00fyuq6f[m]: Stop it.
[09:36:35] <nckx> Go stalk somebody else.
[09:36:37] <DiffieHellman> Demand just exceeds supply and merchants are pumping up those prices.
[09:36:59] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> nckx: blaming me for thing you are doing to me like a proper abuser nice
[09:37:13] <DiffieHellman> Not much cryptocurrency is mined on GPU's anymore really.
[09:37:40] <tpefreedom> I still wish more of those old gpus were available.
[09:37:52] <tpefreedom> Then those at least would be somewhat affordable.
[09:38:11] <nckx> v1dl00fyuq6f[m]: Go away, you ban-evading creep.
[09:38:25] <labrador_> Why are both of you here?
[09:38:39] <nckx> Same reason as you, presumably.
[09:38:56] <nckx> (Plus, the ‘AMD has free drivers’ myth 😛)
[09:39:07] <labrador_> it does have free drivers
[09:39:11] <labrador_> they work really well
[09:39:12] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> nckx: u r disgusting

[09:39:20] <labrador_> *gpu
[09:39:34] <labrador_> v1dl00fyuq6f[m], no u
[09:39:36] <labrador_> lmao
[09:39:49] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> labrador_: whaddya did? u.u
[09:40:15] <labrador_> The firmware is proprietary but its still a better deal than nivida
[09:40:21] <labrador_> where both are blobs
[09:40:46] <nckx> 🤔
[09:40:57] <labrador_> But amd still has not open sourced their psp. Thats bad
[09:41:01] <DiffieHellman> Certain AMDGPU's can be ran firmware free under radeonSI
[09:41:18] <labrador_> DiffieHellman, wait really? Thats neat
[09:41:18] <DiffieHellman> labrador_: "open sourcing" is cringe. We demand releasing as free software instaed.
[09:41:47] <labrador_> DiffieHellman, you can't change the software anyway. You need them signed by amd. The best you can do is cringe open sourcing
[09:42:10] <DiffieHellman> AMD can release the signing key, even though they won't.
[09:42:12] <nckx> Lookie no touchie.
[09:42:28] <tpefreedom> AMD  would honestly have A LOT to gain from release that firmware as free software. If they did that and got good day one support on GNU/Linux, it would pretty much be the so called nail in the coffin for nvidia on GNU/Linux.
[09:42:31] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> DiffieHellman: or like bruteforce the signing key 
[09:42:33] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> and then happy hacking
[09:42:39] <labrador_> tpefreedom, yeah
[09:42:47] <labrador_> Everyone would buy an amd card
[09:43:01] <DiffieHellman> It's specifically designed to make bruteforcing the private key impossible
[09:43:21] <labrador_> DiffieHellman, yeah. Cryptography can be used for or against you
[09:43:28] <DiffieHellman> AMD released AGESA as free software for a while, but then they gave up.
[09:43:30] <tpefreedom> I don't really see a business incentive for the firmware being signed (unless they're locking features the card is technically capable of) or it beingg nonfree.
[09:43:58] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> DiffieHellman: ppl always say that for EFF to came up with custom chips that do the thing
[09:43:58] <DiffieHellman> It's for "muh security"
[09:44:05] <nckx> tpefreedom: Is support (I mean, performance) really ‘poor’ once you load the blobware, though?  The portion of people who care about the difference are a small fraction of the portion of people who use ‘Linux’ on their AMD GPU, themselves a small fraction.
[09:44:09] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> https://gpuopen.com/ https://miaowgpu.org/ also those are interesting
[09:44:20] <labrador_> tpefreedom, security? But then they should allow users to change the key

[09:44:28] <labrador_> There is security with signed software

[09:44:59] <labrador_> yeah

[09:54:32] <DiffieHellman> RISC-V is sadly only slightly better than AMD64 and ARM, as each vendor adds their own proprietary extensions and you do not know what's in that processor you recieve., 
[09:55:37] <DiffieHellman> There are thankfully a few free RISC-V hardware designs that can run on FGPA's, but getting those to run fast and then publishing that is means you risk getting slammed by patents.

[10:12:47] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> for free software to be always better and keep people that are not convinced in free software in the discussion
[10:12:55] <DiffieHellman> That's the "open source" ideals, not the free software ideals.\
[10:13:43] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> nckx: i don't troll
[10:13:45] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary software may be technically superior and is the only version that exists, but the whole idea it to identify that and reject that instead of putting convience above all else
[10:13:57] <DiffieHellman> "open source" puts conveience above all else
[10:14:38] <DiffieHellman> Thus, the "open source" camp doesn't think twice about using proprietary software
[10:15:14] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> DiffieHellman: i see differences in Open-source and free software, but i agree that in the EU the claim is very similar .. mostly bcs we have a lot of lobbist that try to confuse voters that "free software has freedom limitations" to promote open-source

[10:17:19] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> bcs open-source ppl are mostly just really concerned about economy and don't realize that free software is more economical 
[10:17:42] <DiffieHellman> There's no point "opening a dialogue" with people who are completely against free software.
[10:17:53] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> if you are just an elitist with closed mind refusing to have a conversation abotu the issue then you are only helping the other side tbh

[10:18:51] <DiffieHellman> I describe the issue and but I don't try and comprimise between 100% freedom and 0% freedom.
[10:18:57] <DiffieHellman> I go for 100%
[10:19:15] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> i am happy with 1% freedom as it evolves in 100% over the time
[10:19:32] <DiffieHellman> But it won't, it'll go from 1% to 0%
[10:19:43] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> that's how it went with gitpot at least.. freesoftware advocates and me slowly rewritting their source to be economical to go fully free software

[10:21:07] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> and it makes sense to use MIT for some projects 
[10:22:06] <DiffieHellman> The FSF refuses to comprimise on things that should not be compromised on.
[10:22:16] <DiffieHellman> I don't see how that's a lack of political competence
[10:22:28] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> it's political malpractice 
[10:23:04] <DiffieHellman> It's malpractice to slowly arrive at the intended goal?
[10:24:16] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> i would argue that current FSF's politics are supportive of proprietary, bcs if you are basically forcing free software on people and have close mind about it like a religion.. instead of opening a conversation with them to discuss the advantages and disadvantages while educating them about the subject
[10:24:54] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> bcs naturally open-source movement are just proprietary ppl that are tired of reinventing the wheel and are incompetent politically to understand the benefits of free software as it's not producing income directly

[10:26:30] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> The approach that EU is using is to spread the awareness about the policy, talk about it with people and let people decide whether they want to support the policy and then respect their decision

That, and Michaelsoft having dominated all desktop for years, people are just too used to what they are used to.

[13:09:34] <DiffieHellman> Your cert gets comprimised and it's valid for 1.5 years still.

[13:11:16] <DiffieHellman> V-T60: The tests are only really useful at showing that you're good at remembering the semi-incorrect answers to questions that don't apply to real life. Just using something will give you far more experience then passing any test cert will.

[13:43:42] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> 3g of tea lasts for up to 12L of tea
[13:44:07] <labrador> Hi
[13:44:21] <DiffieHellman> I haven't constructed 深紅, so she can't screech about the tea.
[13:44:30] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> teabags are usually full of dehydrated plant matter instead of the leaves thus why it's just barelly 2 cups
[13:44:34] <labrador> So I created a private master key,and two subordinate keys
[13:44:43] <DiffieHellman> Not slave keys/
[13:44:54] <DiffieHellman> *?
[13:45:05] <labrador> The flags for the master is SC and for the slaves is S and E
[13:45:19] <labrador> Is there anyway to make the master only C
[13:45:28] <labrador> Because I won't sign with it
[13:45:35] <V-T60> i recommend using a gaiwan

[13:53:43] <labrador> v1dl00fyuq6f[m], see my system is to use the master keys for WoT stuff(ie certifying keys and being certified),the actual encryption and signing is to be done by subkeys. Two RSA(sign only) and encrypt only pairs do the work,which are regularly rotated.
[13:54:03] <labrador> So in accordance to that,my subkeys have the flags E and S set,which makes sense
[13:54:20] <labrador> But the master keys instead of just a C,have both SC
[13:54:31] <labrador> Even though I won't be using them for signing
[13:54:46] <labrador> So I want to make it C,to be consistent

[15:37:28] <vitali64matrix> I think that's penaiple who called you a tranny
[15:37:36] <irelativism> leah: "you were systematically trolling all my channels and you called me a tranny and a "he". so yeah, go fuck yourself. you're banned from all my chats lol"that is a lie dont be manipulative
[15:37:36] <ewwegweg> GNUHacker LiberaChat is free service
[15:37:41] * v1dl00fyuq6f[m] doesn't understand why are some people considering "tranny" being a slur as it sounds like a cuter way to say trans
[15:37:42] <vitali64matrix> leah: not irelativism 
[15:37:45] <leah> irelativism: i gave you months of time to improve your behaviour and you kept just being an asshole. i got sick of you
[15:38:09] <vitali64matrix> leah: HE NEVER SAID THAT YOU WERE A TRANNY
[15:38:09] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> whatever happened i am against bans, unban him grr
[15:38:19] <vitali64matrix> leah: IT WAS PENAIPLE WHO SAID THAT

[15:38:23] <leah> oh, right
[15:38:25] <leah> ok
[15:38:28] <leah> but you were still a troll
[15:38:32] <leah> yeah it was pineapple who said that
[15:38:42] <leah> i can't tell you two apart half the time, because you both behave in exactly the same way
[15:38:52] <vitali64matrix> leah: they just were offtopic
[15:38:54] <irelativism> Im not a troll I just pointed out your argument was incorrect
[15:38:55] <vitali64matrix> That's it
[15:38:59] <irelativism> and you didnt like it
[15:39:00] <leah> just standard sociopathic behaviour and gaslighting when i say "stop trolling"
[15:39:05] <irelativism> so you used your power abusively
[15:39:11] <leah> and then you just troll more. derail conversations more
[15:39:11] <vitali64matrix> leah: not pineapple, penaiple lol
[15:39:13] <DiffieHellman> POWER ABUSE
[15:39:13] <irelativism> is also not the first time you do so

[15:40:05] <leah> talking about irelativism here
[15:40:07] <irelativism> a person even more endolged in his power then you
[15:40:09] <DiffieHellman> No-one complains about me, and I make spicy posts :D
[15:40:10] * v1dl00fyuq6f[m] doesn't want to be against trans but also not against bans
[15:40:14] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> is such option available
[15:40:19] <vitali64matrix> irelativism: if she was abusing, I would be banned forever in #libreboot
[15:40:28] <vitali64matrix> But no
[15:40:40] <irelativism> again vitali64 you are usefull now 
[15:40:44] <vitali64matrix> She just quieted me and unquieted me afterwards 
[15:40:45] <kompowiec> <leah> just standard sociopathic behaviour and gaslighting when i say "stop trolling"
[15:40:45] <irelativism> that is why
[15:40:45] <kompowiec> basically he was exposed by me once. At that point, he should have let go if he still does.
[15:40:46] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> DiffieHellman: i could start if you want~
[15:40:56] <vitali64matrix> And she apoligiesed

[15:44:20] <leah> you contribute nothing to the project, and you derail every conversation
[15:44:29] <irelativism> the only thing I said is that your point regarding luke smith is incorrect because he also has usefull content, regardless of his beleives

[15:45:06] <leah> that's how life works

[15:45:36] <leah> look it up
[15:45:39] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: what are the implications of me acting like a decent human being against you.. asking for a friend

[15:46:16] <gustaf> projection much_ 
[15:46:31] <gustaf> ?
[15:46:34] <irelativism> I have tried to help you in the past being that with osboot logo and many other things
[15:46:37] <vitali64matrix> DiffieHellman: YES YES YEES 
[15:46:49] <leah> irelativism: yes, and the price is too high
[15:46:52] <irelativism> your manipulation on this issue leah is outstanding
[15:46:53] <vitali64matrix> irelativism: I hate bad words
[15:47:05] <leah> irelativism: you're the one who's manipulative
[15:47:06] <DiffieHellman> vitali64matrix: That white theme and phoneposting saddens me
[15:47:20] <leah> you're currently repeating the same lie, because you know that if you say it enough, people will beleive you
[15:47:24] <irelativism> the reality of the fact is I pointed out your bulshit argument against luke smith you didnt like it so you ban me
[15:47:29] <vitali64matrix> DiffieHellman: lol
[15:47:43] <vitali64matrix> The theme turns to dark automatically
[15:47:45] <irelativism> has you see that is a abuse of your power within the libreboot project
[15:47:56] <gustaf> so, fork it
[15:47:58] <leah> irelativism: you need to take a step back
[15:47:59] <vitali64matrix> And most of the time, I use my laptop
[15:48:02] <leah> and seriously look at yourself
[15:48:06] <irelativism> and that action might cost you the trust in you by the gnu project
[15:48:13] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> gustaf: grr
[15:48:15] <DiffieHellman> Idk, but if leah bans someone it's probably deserved.
[15:48:17] <leah> one day, you will see the evil in you ,and i hope that day comes. when it does, you will become a better person
[15:48:32] <leah> you are a bad person
[15:48:37] <leah> and i say, good riddance
[15:48:38] <irelativism> no you just need to get outside your egobuble and realize what you did leah 
[15:48:50] <leah> the only reason you're not banned in #fsf is because ggoes has the patience of a saint
[15:49:00] <leah> i don't. my time costs money
[15:49:16] <irelativism> "ou will become a better person
[15:49:16] <irelativism> you are a bad person" typical maniulative leah 
[15:49:18] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: ain't true he's banning me all the time hmph
[15:49:37] <irelativism> is very easy to do an atack on the person to try to weasel your way out of this
[15:49:49] <leah> just so we're clear:
[15:50:18] <leah> you were trolling #libreboot for years. you constantly shitpost, de-railing discussions endlessly
[15:50:19] <irelativism> "i don't. my time costs money" that is the problem you think other peoples live surround arround yours
[15:50:21] <leah> you waste everyone's time
[15:50:28] <leah> then when you're called out, you say you're not trolling
[15:50:29] <leah> while trolling
[15:50:40] <irelativism> the only reason Im wasting time with this is to expose your behaviour
[15:50:46] <leah> i let you back in to the channel because you agreed you would try to behave better
[15:50:51] <leah> you didn't. you went straight back to your old ways
[15:50:57] <irelativism> which you are doing a wonderfull job showcasing
[15:51:01] <leah> and now, you are punishing not only me, but the fsf
[15:51:07] <leah> you are punishing the fsf by disrupting #fsf too
[15:51:13] <leah> to be clear, right now you are de-railing #fsf
[15:51:15] <irelativism> you are a compulsive lier
[15:51:18] <irelativism> "you agreed you would try to behave better"
[15:51:23] <irelativism> that is not true
[15:51:25] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> i don't feel like FSF is disrupted with this
[15:51:28] <irelativism> I never talk to you
[15:51:30] <leah> #fsf is not your personal kangaroo court where you get to duke it out with your enemy of the week (currently me)
[15:51:41] <leah> #fsf is for discussion of free software, and matters pertaining to fsf specifically
[15:51:57] <leah> it is not your personal courtroom to resolve petty disputes that you have with me, or anyone else
[15:52:12] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: FSF is a good place to address political and personal issues hmph
[15:52:14] <irelativism> the fsf unfortunately is the only neutral channel were your influence is not felt fortunately
[15:52:29] <vitali64matrix> And also where I love sharing software
[15:52:37] <vitali64matrix> irelativism: lol
[15:52:39] <irelativism> leah: if you want you cant ask sorry for your abusive ban
[15:52:41] <kompowiec> irelativism, I have already revealed once that you were / are a troll. Let it go.
[15:52:41] <leah> irelativism: it is not neutral. and you will be banned here if you continue
[15:52:46] <leah> ggoes won't tolerate you for much longer
[15:52:49] <leah> you're being an asshole here
[15:53:00] <leah> irelativism: what you're doing here in #fsf right now, is exactly what you do every day
[15:53:02] <vitali64matrix> v1dl00fyuq6f: replies do not exist on irc
[15:53:03] <irelativism> if not no worries but dont bulshit about what really happend
[15:53:03] <leah> you did it in #libreboot
[15:53:07] <leah> you make everything about you
[15:53:11] <irelativism> is quite simple
[15:53:12] <leah> and you always have to have the last word
[15:53:13] <vitali64matrix> leah: bad word? No way
[15:53:21] <leah> probably because of low self esteem eh? but that's not my problem
[15:53:22] <leah> talk to a therapist
[15:53:25] <leah> you need one
[15:53:25] <irelativism> leah: just look at the logs
[15:53:37] <kompowiec> I don't know the case, but I had a discussion with you here once and saw it.
[15:53:38] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: he's not, he's being respective about the issue, stop threatening him
[15:53:39] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> vitali64matrix: THEIR LOSS
[15:53:40] <irelativism> is not about the "last word"
[15:53:54] <irelativism> but about you abusive beahaviour ounce again
[15:53:57] * leah will now watch irelativism try to get the last word
[15:54:28] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> hmm ok i am convinced that leah is the abusive one in this exchange based on messages she send
[15:54:30] * DiffieHellman takes it instead
[15:54:36] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> don't hate me though
[15:54:38] <DiffieHellman> Install Gentoo-libre
[15:54:57] <vitali64matrix> v1dl00fyuq6f: leah's nice
[15:55:04] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> DiffieHellman: ehw gentoo
[15:55:11] <leah> irelativism: i really hope you become better one day
[15:55:12] <vitali64matrix> DiffieHellman: 🤣👍
[15:55:24] <DiffieHellman> v1dl00fyuq6f[m]: You have poor taste. What a suprise.
[15:55:26] <leah> you could contribute a lot to projects, and be a great asset for the community
[15:55:30] <gustaf> I see so many people sad that Linus is no longer flaming people on the kernel dev list
[15:55:31] <DiffieHellman> vitali64matrix: I cn't see that emoji.
[15:55:32] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> vitali64matrix: ye she seemed nice, but her messages here feel manipulative and abusive here
[15:55:34] <leah> irelativism: your graphics design skills are amazing
[15:55:35] <gustaf> so I thought being abusive is good 
[15:55:50] <irelativism> the reality of the matter is leah spent 1 hour shitting on luke smith and lanchad and saying all his work is pointless, I argued against and presented refutations for that, because of that and because I assume a big ego instead of acepting my refutations, I was banned that is obviously not acceptable.
[15:55:50] <leah> and you have a keen intellect
[15:55:55] <DiffieHellman> gustaf: Linus sold out unfortunately.
[15:56:05] <DiffieHellman> It's what happens if you don't really have morals.
[15:56:09] <leah> irelativism: no, i said: don't promote fascists in #libreboot
[15:56:14] <leah> and you responded by promoting luke smith, a fascist
[15:56:22] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> DiffieHellman: oh no i don't like using distro that has hard dependency on python spaghetti that has major issues resolving dependencies what a poor taste!
[15:56:25] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> #doGuix
[15:56:27] <irelativism> I never promoted
[15:56:33] <leah> your words and actions served to make people believe that he is ultimately a good person
[15:56:35] <leah> he is not
[15:56:35] <irelativism> given I dont agree politically with him
[15:56:41] <leah> he wants me and millions others like me dead
[15:56:43] <leah> he is evil
[15:56:44] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> gustaf: just when i do it hmph
[15:56:47] <DiffieHellman> Some Luke Smith posts are pretty good, not most though.
[15:56:53] <leah> and that's why you were banned. because you were promoting him in my channel
[15:56:55] <DiffieHellman> I like his takes on the BSD licenses
[15:56:57] <irelativism> I just said your argument against everything he has done is incorrect
[15:57:06] <irelativism> you didnt like it so you ban me
[15:57:09] <irelativism> that is the reality
[15:57:12] <vitali64matrix> Oh no!
[15:57:14] <leah> to be clear, i banned you from #libreboot because you were promoting a person who literally wants me to die
[15:57:15] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: he looks like good person to me as i ain't aware of him doing anything ungood
[15:57:21] <irelativism> no matter how many atacks you do to my person
[15:57:23] <leah> luke smith believe that transgender people should commit suicide
[15:57:27] <leah> that is literally what he thinks
[15:57:30] <DiffieHellman> Wew lad
[15:57:42] * vitali64matrix still watches some videos of Mental Outlaw (mostly tutorials and news)
[15:57:43] <irelativism> I dont care about any of that
[15:57:46] <leah> you were banned from #libreboot because you were promoting this person in #libreboot
[15:57:56] <irelativism> I just said some of his work is usefull that is all
[15:57:57] <leah> i told you not to, and you did it anyway
[15:58:03] <leah> i don't care about his work
[15:58:03] <DiffieHellman> I don't really care what people think, I care what they do.
[15:58:08] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> hmm i hate luke smith he's such a retard
[15:58:39] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> but he's a public figure and video producer so i don't think that mentioning his video in the room is a direct attack on you leah
[15:58:49] <irelativism> I didnt even had time to finish my point before you banned me, but on the other hand you spent 1 hour laying out your point
[15:58:57] <irelativism> sont you think there is something wrong with that?
[15:59:12] <irelativism> I do and I know that is what people call abuse of power
[15:59:21] <gustaf> didn't you wnat an explanation irelativism ? 
[15:59:26] <gustaf> and know you have it? 
[15:59:43] <leah> i can't deal with this. it's the same bullshit every day
[15:59:51] <gustaf> does this Smith person distribute content outside youtubr? 
[15:59:55] <irelativism> now if you are humild enough to admit to your mistake great, but dont bulshit on what I did or said and on top of that lie about it leah 
[16:00:05] <leah> i didn't make a mistake
[16:00:10] <leah> banning you was a correct decision
[16:00:12] <leah> you're an asshole
[16:00:21] <gnoo> leah: any primary source for the luke smith stuff?
[16:00:26] <irelativism> that is an assumption on your part
[16:00:39] <leah> do you ever just switch off?
[16:00:40] <irelativism> gievn you obviously dont know me
[16:00:47] <DiffieHellman> gustaf: Please don't call things "content", but yes he makes posts on lukesmith.xyz
[16:00:49] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah i think you are over reacting and things you said feel abusive and manipulative, but i didn't see the whole convo 
[16:00:50] <irelativism> and have no problem lying about my person
[16:00:53] <leah> seriously. go take a break for an hour. breath fresh air and think
[16:00:53] <kompowiec> <DiffieHellman> I like his takes on the BSD licenses
[16:00:54] <kompowiec> same
[16:00:59] <leah> try to think what you're saying
[16:01:05] <leah> analyse your actions
[16:01:06] <irelativism> I value logic to much to "switch off"
[16:01:12] <leah> i hope one day that you become a better person
[16:01:14] <DiffieHellman> Example: https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-i-use-the-gpl-and-not-cuck-licenses
[16:01:15] <gnoo> gustaf: he made some cool scripts, you can check it out on his git server
[16:01:20] <irelativism> you are the one that need to do so
[16:01:28] <irelativism> as well as adress your ego problem
[16:01:29] <gustaf> "cuck licenses"
[16:01:31] <gustaf> JFC
[16:01:34] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> how bow you both take a cake on the issue 
[16:01:41] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> and reflect on what you did~
[16:02:14] <irelativism> I dont care about anything luke smith my simple point is it is not true everything he does is not usable because of his believes
[16:02:18] <gnoo> i like his other filosophy behind free software as well
[16:02:26] <irelativism> that is an extreme position that Im not ok with
[16:02:26] <vitali64matrix> leah: actually without him, I wouldn't discover Libreboot lol
[16:02:45] <gnoo> philosophy asfd 
[16:02:49] <irelativism> vitali64: exactly that is my only and single point
[16:02:51] <gnoo> oops, didn't ment to send that
[16:03:05] <gnoo> philosophy*
[16:03:08] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> irelativism: i find that valid in general, but due to the abuse and hate against trans i don't align with that atm
[16:03:14] <kompowiec> <DiffieHellman> I don't really care what people think, I care what they do.
[16:03:15] <kompowiec> based
[16:03:24] <irelativism> not everything that person does is garbage just because we dont agree with his philosophy
[16:03:45] <irelativism> again my only and single point
[16:03:53] <DiffieHellman> Hmm, I'm disliking the word choices in the article.
[16:04:05] <kompowiec> I have it to such an extent that it is easier for me to remember the nickname than the name and surname :P
[16:04:07] <leah> i've got real work to do
[16:04:13] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> +1
[16:04:21] <irelativism> so again is not ok to use your position of power leah to censor and lie about my person, just because I presented that argument
[16:04:38] <irelativism> it is manipulative and abusive on your part and should not be acceptable
[16:04:46] <leah> i literally do not care about your argument. i said: don't talk about fascists
[16:04:50] <leah> and you talked about luke smith
[16:04:52] <leah> who is a fascist
[16:04:58] <leah> what part of that are you not getting
[16:05:13] <leah> the quality of his work (and yes, he is highly intelligent and does good technical work) is entirely irrelevant
[16:05:15] <kompowiec> leah, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law
[16:05:16] <leah> i said:
[16:05:18] <leah> don't talk about him
[16:05:20] <irelativism> its not ok leah, and you know that given all the problem you had in the movement regarding similar actions in the past
[16:05:21] <leah> and you talked about him
[16:05:23] <leah> so you were banned
[16:05:25] <leah> simple
[16:05:34] <leah> you go into a place, and you disobey the rules?
[16:05:35] <leah> guess what
[16:05:37] <leah> you get thrown out
[16:05:53] <leah> i haven't curtailed your freedoms or your rights to free expression, i simply showed you the door, because you're an asshole
[16:05:54] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: talking about luke smith = reason to ban? That's bullshit
[16:05:57] <leah> it's like the xkcd comic
[16:06:06] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> even when luka smith is dipshit
[16:06:08] <leah> https://xkcd.com/1357/
[16:06:11] <leah> read that
[16:06:20] <leah> you can say what you want. but i don't have to listen to you or host you while you talk
[16:06:24] <leah> you are banned from #libreboot
[16:06:24] <irelativism> "don't talk about fascists
[16:06:24] <irelativism> and you talked about luke smith" so you can talk about him for 1 hour on the channel before I presented my argument. but the moment I present mine all of the suden Im banned ;P
[16:06:32] <leah> and i think ggoes should ban you from #fsf too
[16:06:36] <leah> but that's their decision not mine
[16:07:17] <leah> please be more respectful of the communities you participate in
[16:07:21] <kompowiec> it does not change the fact that you have used the godwin's law at this point.
[16:07:23] <irelativism> "don't talk about fascists
[16:07:23] <irelativism> and you talked about luke smith" so you can talk about him for 1 hour on the channel before I presented my argument. but the moment I present mine all of the suden Im banned
[16:07:24] <leah> in particular, please stop derailing #fsf
[16:07:38] <irelativism> this is the reality leah double standarts
[16:07:41] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: yes but that also don't justify censoring once opinion.. should be your responsibility to ensure that ppl can share their opinion in rooms that you manage to avoid claims of an abusive dictatorship 
[16:07:41] <DiffieHellman> Multi track drifting
[16:07:43] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> and threatening with ban by ggoes is asshole thing from you he didn't violate any rules in this channel that i know of
[16:07:44] <irelativism> its abusive on your part
[16:07:44] <leah> your actions in #fsf are very bad. #fsf is not the place for you to resolve any dispute that you have with me
[16:07:54] <isf> please speak about Free Software
[16:07:59] <kompowiec> ^
[16:08:14] <high_ground> I agree
[16:08:15] <leah> irelativism: be better. that's all i can say to you
[16:08:17] <isf> all other things are trivial 
[16:08:27] <irelativism> has I said leah it is the only neutral place we can discussed
[16:08:32] <leah> and with that, i will get back to my things. do what you want
[16:08:36] <irelativism> whitout the treath of another ban
[16:08:43] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah: FSF is who created and manages free software movement, this seems very relevant here
[16:09:04] <kompowiec> <leah> your actions in #fsf are very bad. #fsf is not the place for you to resolve any dispute that you have with me
[16:09:04] <kompowiec> so add it to ignore and close the topic.
[16:09:10] <leah> that's actually false, but the fsf and gnu project certainly helped it thrive when it started failing
[16:09:14] <leah> free software predates fsf/gnu
[16:09:19] <irelativism> leah: forget about "teaching me lessons" and think again about your actions
[16:09:25] <irelativism> the reality is "don't talk about fascists
[16:09:25] <irelativism> and you talked about luke smith" so you can talk about him for 1 hour on the channel before I presented my argument. but the moment I present mine all of the suden Im banned
[16:09:32] <leah> but it started getting crushed. the gnu project and fsf helped save it
[16:09:39] <leah> but don't forget others like the BSDs
[16:09:42] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> isf: the culture of free software communities is not trivial.. rather critical
[16:09:42] <isf> yo isnt a solo chat
[16:09:53] <isf> the problem of them
[16:09:53] <leah> but yeah, i value the fsf
[16:10:00] <isf> are trivial for the Free Software movemement
[16:10:05] <isf> movement
[16:10:05] <leah> anyway. have fun everyone!
[16:10:24] <irelativism> this is what happend, if you cant accept it then we have a bigger problem "don't talk about fascists
[16:10:24] <irelativism> and you talked about luke smith" so you can talk about him for 1 hour on the channel before I presented my argument. but the moment I present mine all of the suden Im banned
[16:10:29] <leah> i'm sorry about irelativism. this is something between me and him, i want to wash my hands of it personally
[16:10:29] <isf> if you leah dont want read him, becouse someone disban him or idk, block him
[16:10:32] <isf> i do that
[16:10:40] <leah> good idea
[16:10:57] <isf> i have like 60 domains banned in mastodon
[16:10:59] * leah has added irelativism to /ignore
[16:11:01] <isf> xD
[16:11:08] <irelativism> I will be wating for an answer even though you shown highly manipulative behaviour here ounce again
[16:11:17] <leah> i hate using /ignore though, because then i read channels and they stop making sense
[16:11:20] <irelativism> *answer=apology
[16:11:21] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> i don't see why is banning to avoid a problem that seems to be caused by you is the solution here
[16:11:38] <kompowiec> finally
[16:11:45] <isf> dont worry, that happen becouse in the real life, this type of conversation doesn exist
[16:11:48] <irelativism> again this is what happend: "don't talk about fascists
[16:11:48] <irelativism> and you talked about luke smith" so you can talk about him for 1 hour on the channel before I presented my argument. but the moment I present mine all of the suden Im banned
[16:12:11] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> and you should consider resigning if you just ban people bcs they say something about luke smith 
[16:12:16] <isf> dude, why you want still speaking about something arent relevant for the FSF?
[16:12:31] <irelativism> double standarts is dangerous, and this kind of abusive and manioulative behaviour to cover her tracks by leah should not be accepted within our community
[16:12:36] <high_ground> I mean, you are also isf
[16:12:45] <isf> im also what
[16:13:00] <irelativism> this is highly relevant for the fsf
[16:13:00] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> isf: very relevant and critical.. FSF is a great channel to address these issues as a collective 
[16:13:14] <isf> i dont like the collective
[16:13:17] <irelativism> given the is a consideration of making libreboot project back part of GNU
[16:13:27] <irelativism> but with this kinds of behaviours
[16:13:29] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> isf: then like a democracy 
[16:13:36] <isf> democracy dont work
[16:13:39] <irelativism> and while leah is bahving like this 
[16:13:45] <kompowiec> isf, i agree
[16:13:50] <irelativism> should never become part of GNU ounce again
[16:13:50] <isf> thats the reason
[16:13:54] <isf> free software is individual freedom
[16:14:06] <isf> and then, when you have individual freedom, the community can have freedom
[16:14:10] <isf> but, only when the individual have
[16:14:21] <irelativism> or at least until leahdrops her ego and starts acting in a less manipulative manner
[16:14:24] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> irelativism: GNU doesn't enforce behavior of it's project members, they are all invidual juristictions
[16:14:25] <kompowiec> especially if it ends with rant
[16:14:26] *** Quits: xiews (~wxie@101.93.17.62) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[16:14:53] <irelativism> again leah "don't talk about fascists
[16:14:53] <irelativism> and you talked about luke smith" so you can talk about him for 1 hour on the channel before I presented my argument. but the moment I present mine all of the suden Im banned
[16:14:58] <leah> ggoes: sorry once again for all the trouble. i regret that this leaked into #fsf. it's unfair that you should have to deal with this
[16:15:05] <leah> you have my sympathy
[16:15:23] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> i do agree that leah behavior is not acceptable based on what she said here
[16:15:24] <irelativism> this should not be accepted and people should consider before wanting libreboot back in the gnu project
[16:15:55] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> irelativism: nah GNU doesn't care about GNU projects in terms of governance and established culture
[16:16:04] <irelativism> at least while leah behaves like this
[16:16:18] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> the software talks
[16:17:40] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> leah left the conversation so the matter should be considered as discussed
[16:19:03] <labrador> huh finally that shit ended,I don't even know why there was so much word vomit. I was busy configuring gpg.

[16:20:49] * irelativism will go back to work on replicant
[16:20:53] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> irelativism: shh i said discussed 🔪

[16:21:25] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> shhhhhh
[16:21:34] <irelativism> unfurtunatly is the reality of the situation
[16:21:44] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> I SAID I WILL FUCKING STAB 🔪
[16:21:47] <labrador> leah, hey you're a libreboot dev. Nice
[16:21:49] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> shut the hell up
[16:21:52] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> 💢
[16:22:00] <irelativism> leah: you got it all wrong the one that is being manipulative is your here
[16:22:05] <leah> i'm *the* libreboot dev. i created the project
[16:22:08] <irelativism> also I though you had ignored me
[16:22:12] <irelativism> another lie
[16:22:17] <irelativism> doesnt amaze me
[16:22:52] <leah> be better
[16:22:54] <labrador> leah, well thats fine. But now you aren't the only dev. So I think my statement still remains true.
[16:23:00] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> hmmm~ 
[16:23:15] <leah> labrador: yeah i've picked up a few new devs
[16:23:24] <leah> i've got 3 people working on arm stuff at the moment
[16:23:31] <ewwegweg> labrador solanum is libre chat source code
[16:23:34] <leah> collectively between them, for uboot and grub stuff
[16:23:37] <ewwegweg> https://github.com/Libera-Chat/solanum labrador
[16:23:45] <leah> currently, it has been identified that grub lacks fmap support
[16:23:46] <labrador> ewwegweg, lmao when did I ask for that
[16:23:51] <irelativism> notheless I appreciate leah work even sufering from her manipulative and abusive behaviour, the same way I appreciate luke smith work, even though his extreme religious belives
[16:24:03] <leah> it does have arm support, and does boot, but on chromebooks with fmap, it stalls because it can't load anything from flash
[16:24:06] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> irelativism: grrr
[16:24:07] <leah> because it doesn't understand fmap
[16:24:10] * v1dl00fyuq6f[m] stabs
[16:24:10] <irelativism> leah: and luke and actually very similar in this situation
[16:24:12] <labrador> irelativism, luke smith is a right wing retard.
[16:24:21] <leah> belgin in #libreboot is attempting to figure out where the rom is loaded into ram at bootup
[16:24:24] <labrador> Nothing he says is actually true
[16:24:32] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> i don't mind right wingers~ 
[16:24:40] <leah> and based on that, know where to operate in memory, from grub src
[16:24:47] <leah> to interpret fmap structure
[16:24:48] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> he's full of shit that makes it painful to listen to him though 
[16:24:55] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> he also uses arch ehww
[16:24:57] <leah> see: https://doc.coreboot.org/lib/flashmap.html?highlight=fmap
[16:25:03] <irelativism> labrador: I never said the contrary
[16:25:08] <leah> not so much a thing we care about on x86 but on arm it's troublesome
[16:25:12] <leah> anyway
[16:25:15] <leah> belgin is working on that
[16:25:21] <leah> hopefully we can get bare metal grub going on arm
[16:25:26] <leah> *bare metal* grub. not uefi shit
[16:25:33] <ewwegweg> labrador what
[16:25:48] <labrador> leah, well I guess thats what not having a standard firmware interface gets you on arm
[16:25:52] <isf> but all new hardware is uefi
[16:26:04] <DiffieHellman> UEFI is just trash
[16:26:05] <leah> labrador: well, chromebooks are great
[16:26:07] <isf> how we can have a free software 
[16:26:10] <leah> google at least tries to standardize stuff
[16:26:10] <isf> in new hardware?
[16:26:21] <leah> i nuked arm in libreboot because there was no point, on the already supported hardware
[16:26:24] <labrador> leah, really? Chromebooks? Thats what you think is great?
[16:26:25] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> i try to standardize stuff too hmph
[16:26:25] <DiffieHellman> Anything that uses fat32 needs to be taken to the flame

[16:26:41] <leah> except all libreboot 2016 did was remove google branding basically
[16:26:54] <leah> the re-added rockchip support in libreboot will have those machines use uboot or grub
[16:26:59] <leah> not depthcharge bootloader
[16:27:08] <leah> the work has only recently started
[16:27:16] <leah> and lucky us, grub already does support arm
[16:27:20] <leah> that work started by others, years ago
[16:27:32] <leah> but grub lacks fmap support. so it's not yet useful on *chromebook* arm platforms
[16:27:39] <leah> so fmap is being implemented
[16:27:54] <leah> i'll try to get belgin to submit the patch to gnu once it's ready too
[16:27:59] <leah> this is something upstream ought to have
[16:28:38] <isf> i want a libreboot in my 2021 pc :(
[16:28:41] <leah> grub is the standard bootloader in libreboot, on x86
[16:28:47] <labrador> leah, why did you disassociate with GNU anyway?
[16:28:50] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> aaaa stop teasing me to break my notebook's bootloader i need to workkk aaaaa
[16:28:55] <leah> and libreboot is starting on its move towards its post-x86 future
[16:28:56] <labrador> isf, I don't think that will ever happen
[16:28:58] <leah> we are starting with arm
[16:29:07] <leah> and i insisted upon having grub still as the default coreboot payload on arm ;)
[16:29:11] <DiffieHellman> isf: Too bad, all new hardware uses proprietary software.
[16:29:12] <leah> so that is what's being done
[16:29:15] <DiffieHellman> *AMD64
[16:29:19] <leah> vitali64matrix meanwhile is working with gnutoo on integrating uboot
[16:29:21] <labrador> leah, nice. Finally libreboot breaks away from decade old chips
[16:29:32] <leah> i'm confident that we will have something off the ground some time this year, on arm
[16:29:32] <irelativism> RISC-V sifive board is a good option
[16:29:36] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> gnutoo is a thing?
[16:29:47] <leah> riscv yes, that's also in my crosshairs
[16:29:54] <DiffieHellman> It's a nick.
[16:29:55] <irelativism> gnutoo is to busy with replicant
[16:29:59] <leah> but for that, it looks like oreboot integration (alongside coreboot) will be useful
[16:30:09] <leah> oreboot is a fork of coreboot, rewritten in rust, and it focuses on riscv hardware

[16:34:03] <labrador> thats why it has so fat binaries
[16:34:03] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> Show me one
[16:34:12] <labrador> Everything is just in one binary
[16:34:18] <high_ground> Well, rust atleast isnt completely safe as some claims
[16:34:19] <labrador> And there is NO spec
[16:34:22] <DiffieHellman> All Rust projects will have CVE's, as good luck writing a decent program without unsafe
[16:34:27] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> everything can be compiled in one binary on demand

[16:34:44] <high_ground> Yea, unsafe in rust is used alot in low level programs
[16:34:47] <leah> https://postmarketos.org/
[16:34:51] <labrador> leah, postmarketos is nice. With phosh
[16:34:53] <DiffieHellman> Ah yeah, even if no unsafe, the Sepples compiler has a chance of spitting out garbage code.
[16:34:58] <labrador> I like android too tho
[16:35:00] <leah> they are doing some serious reverse engineering of bootloaders and such

[16:35:54] <v1dl00fyuq6f[m]> did you even tried rustlang.. those are very uninformed opinions lol
[16:35:59] <irelativism> so not really related to postmarketOS
[16:36:11] <leah> DiffieHellman: it's not gnu
[16:36:15] <leah> it's busybox+musl what they have
[16:36:33] <leah> irelativism: what stance is that?
[16:36:50] <irelativism> that is not a bad thing given the bloat on some of the parts of GNU
[16:36:50] <DiffieHellman> leah: Where can get the GNU version?4
[16:37:00] <labrador> well yeah. I would like gnu too
[16:37:02] <gustaf> DiffieHellman: what's a better term than "content" ?
[16:37:13] <labrador> irelativism, its not bloat
[16:37:15] <leah> gnu sucks. busybox is better
[16:37:16] <labrador> Its features
[16:37:19] <leah> busybox+musl
[16:37:19] <labrador> leah, no
[16:37:25] <leah> it's more technically correct and less bloated
[16:37:25] <DiffieHellman> gustaf: The actual type of media. For videos, it's videos.
[16:37:30] <leah> though, gnu is nice too
[16:37:36] <labrador> leah, it does not suck. GNU tools are licensed under the gpl
[16:37:36] <leah> well
[16:37:39] <DiffieHellman> GNU is still faster than BusyBox
[16:37:39] <labrador> Thats one thing
[16:37:39] <leah> gnu is actually great
[16:37:41] <irelativism> "features" many times = bloat
[16:37:42] <leah> but glibc is bloated
[16:37:50] <leah> so is coreutils
[16:37:52] <gustaf> no way I'm visiting an alt-right site to check out the specific stuff posted... "content" is a good generic term

[16:39:05] <leah> anyway, look at postmarketos
[16:39:09] <leah> that project is going places
[16:39:17] <leah> they've already ported phones that wouldn't be very free otherwise
[16:39:27] <leah> e.g. their work on poco f1
[16:39:56] <irelativism> that is true
[16:39:56] <labrador> leah, thats not the best example. Unlocking that phone is some serious trouble
[16:40:10] <leah> but they did the legwork on that
[16:40:12] <irelativism> they even ported the sandcastle project work with a iphone port
[16:40:43] <irelativism> anyway the issue with modern phone is modem broadband separation
[16:40:59] <irelativism> that is why replicant project is still kind of stuck in older hardware
[16:41:12] <labrador> Why are modems black boxes anyway
[16:41:18] <irelativism> pine64 might be a good option though
[16:41:31] <irelativism> the issue is not really being a blackbox
[16:41:33] <labrador> irelativism, yeah the pinephone pro
[16:41:45] <irelativism> but that that blackbox doesnt touch main system
[16:42:17] <irelativism> so there is separation, having a removable battery is also a plus

[20:05:40] <jzsinatra> Are there some countries where software licenses don't have legal power? What I mean, that if someone would copy gplv software to non-free software.
[20:07:28] <isf> that dont have sense
[20:07:36] <isf> becouse free software give freedom
[20:07:57] <isf> so, normaly the people copy nonfree software, or modify it, agaisnt the law
[20:08:34] <isf> that is what happen, in countrys as a venezuela

[20:09:58] <isf> ooh wrong chat
[20:11:25] <frumious> jzsinatra, china is perhaps infamous for giving a shit about software licenses, free or otherwise.  though, lately naomi wu has been making an impact to change this.
[20:11:28] <jzsinatra> Yes, but like if somebody would copy git, add some ads and features to it and not distribute source code and sell it ass TurboGit+ or something similar. I think that that would be illegal in most countries, but are there exceprions.

[20:12:18] <jzsinatra> frumious Yes. China has lots of shady business practices and legal loopholes.
[20:12:38] <labrador> jzsinatra, if copyright is not respected,neither is copyleft
[20:12:58] <labrador> copyleft gets its power through copyright
[20:13:20] <kilobug> jzsinatra: I don't think there are many that officially don't care about licenses, most are member of WTO and WIPO; but sure many have for various reasons broken or unwilling law-enforcement systems that make impossible or near impossible to actually enforce the license
[20:13:28] *** Joins: garjola (~garjola@user/garjola)
[20:13:46] <frumious> I think on paper they honor licenses but it's more about a lack of enforcement.  in wu's fight, usually the company goes, "oh, crap, we didn't realize and we understand now it's in our best interest to honor our GPL when we use code under that license"
