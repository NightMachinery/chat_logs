[00:00:00] <ChocolateArmpits> like 10 minutes for each ts segment
[00:00:10] <cryptic> won't that cause issues if, for example, the stream goes down?
[00:00:18] <cryptic> or there's packet loss or something?
[00:00:35] <ChocolateArmpits> not at all
[00:02:15] <ChocolateArmpits> the only issue you may face is if the extractor expects constant output, so a few seconds missing may result in offset times
[00:04:46] <cryptic> another issue is that I'd really like to associate the server time with each segment

[00:50:46] <emcodem> where you got the info from?
[00:51:03] <kepstin> being talked about on ffmpeg-devel mailing list
[00:51:55] <emcodem> of course, why i ask :D
[00:52:19] <kepstin> honestly, there doesn't seem like that many big changes, although it's also possible the ChangeLog is missing some stuff :)
[00:52:41] <kepstin> The main reason to do a major version change in ffmpeg is that it's an opportunity to remove some deprecated things, iirc.
[00:53:06] <emcodem> well one would usually change the major number if the api has been changed and it is not backward compatible anymore
[00:53:34] <emcodem> exactly what you say :D
[00:57:33] <kepstin> ah, right, doc/APIchanges is the file to read

[01:03:53] <aphysically> yeah I got from ffmpeg-devel ML
[01:06:01] <cryptic> What's the benefit of having a larger segment_time for HLS videos?
[01:07:26] <ChocolateArmpits> less http requests
[01:07:44] <ChocolateArmpits> small segments stress the server more
[01:07:59] <ChocolateArmpits> however large segments will increase latency
[01:08:06] <furq> also you can have longer gops which means less bandwidth
[01:08:22] <furq> large segments are generally better for everything except latency
[01:08:51] <ChocolateArmpits> longer gops hurt seeking
[01:08:59] <cryptic> but if a m3u8 playlist file only contains a maximum of three transport stream (.ts) files, won't there still be HTTP requests?
[01:09:18] <furq> well yeah there'll be four
[01:09:25] <furq> if you have one segment per second there will be a lot more
[01:09:48] <cryptic> is that because ffmpeg is seeking a specific portion of the .ts file to download?
[01:11:32] <cryptic> ah it looks like the server accepts the Range header, so that's probably how it works

[01:12:16] <furq> well normally segment_time splits the file up into multiple chunks
[01:12:53] <furq> with single file i guess the playlist just has byte ranges instead
[01:12:57] <cryptic> right, but if segment_time < duration, would it be setting the Range: header?
[01:12:58] <furq> which would be done by range requests
[01:15:06] <cryptic> I suppose they limit the size of the playlist file specifically for that reason: that's the file that will get requested roughly every DURATION seconds, where DURATION is the duration of the most recently downloaded transport stream

[01:29:18] <emcodem> here is another humble request from my side:
[01:29:54] <emcodem> the decklink device input has an option called -enable_klv
[01:30:20] <emcodem> description is like "output klv if present in vanc"
[01:31:25] <emcodem> when i do this, and my captured signal has this the needed "vanc" data, ffmpeg wil recognize a stream like this:
[01:31:26] <emcodem> Stream #0:2: Data: klv
[01:31:48] <emcodem> now, what in the world could i do with this except maybe writing the raw stuff to disk?

[11:44:51] <roxlu> I'm looking into what people use to test transcoders. I'm working on a transcoder and I want to test if the updates I make are actually improving the transcoder. As this can mean many things I'm wondering what metrics and techniques are common to use when testing media systems?

[11:51:44] <emcodem> regarding metrics i'd have a look into prometheus and grafana
[11:53:26] <roxlu> thanks. I was thinking about measuring the common metrics like cpu, mem, io, etc. with grafana/prom.
[11:54:01] <roxlu> but what I'm also curious about is how one would test if an change was an improvement or not on the output, for the viewer.
[11:54:19] <emcodem> yeah usually i also post queued, running and error jobs as well as job runtime into prom
[11:54:22] <roxlu> this is probably not so straightforward as it depends on the player too
[11:54:48] <roxlu> ah yes, I log those too currently
[11:55:13] <emcodem> the "viewer perspective" is pretty subjective, might be hard to test :D
[11:55:49] <roxlu> yeah
[11:56:08] <roxlu> maybe there are automated ways to test stalls?
[11:58:41] <emcodem> sure but it depends a lot on your workflow. E.g. you can easily see if the encoding process is running, e.g. by sending commands via stdin or just checking if memory usage changes over time
[11:59:26] <emcodem> but it depends on the stuff that you do
[11:59:44] <roxlu> yeah true. what metric would you use to measure memory usage (on linux)?
[12:02:28] <emcodem> residental memory usage
[12:03:23] <roxlu> ok thanks, I've created a script that extractsthe vm* values from /proc/[pid]/status from which I then create a graph
[12:06:39] <furq> roxlu: if you mean image quality then vmaf
[12:07:52] <roxlu> thanks furq, that's something I want to look into indeed.
[12:11:55] <roxlu> and I think that for testing the final user experience the player should store metrics too; e.g. stalls, buffer sizes, etc.

[14:23:40] <furq> -map
[14:23:56] <furq> -map 0 -map 1 will map all streams from both inputs
[14:25:33] <th0rne> Just to clarify, I mean record the audio output from pulse, not the input. So like, that the recording would have the same audio that is playing in the headphones in addition to the audio recorded by the webcam.
[14:26:16] <furq> oh
[14:26:21] <furq> you'd need to make a pulse monitor device for that

[18:19:28] <ravioli> i'm running into weirdness when outputting at certain resolutions. i seem to remember a while ago i read something about that. i know this sounds very vague but is there something in general i should probably be looking out for?
[18:20:29] <DHE> can you be more specific?
[18:20:45] <JEEB> your resolution should be divisible by your chroma subsampling is the most common
[18:20:53] <JEEB> so if you have 4:2:0 you want your stuff to be divisible by 2
[18:20:56] <DHE> there are specific things that aren't allowed, but usually there is an error message explaining it. eg: width/height must be a multiple of 2, but often useful to be a multiple of 16
[18:20:58] <JEEB> (width & height)
[18:21:12] <ravioli> i'm using showspectrumpic to...show a spectrum pic. when telling showspectrumpic to output 4kflat and show frequencies up to 12khz, it doesn't -- it only shows frequencies up to 6khz. even the scale stops at 6khz.
[18:21:16] <ravioli> oh ok that rings a bell
[18:21:22] <DHE> (I say that knowing full well 1080p's height isn't divisible by 16)
[18:22:03] <ravioli> what's weird is it works perfectly fine at 4094x4093
[18:22:17] <ravioli> shows all 12k. scale looks good. everything looks fine.
[18:22:33] <DHE> you might be encoding to a yuv444 format... which is allowed, but some players (especially hardware accelerated ones) can't handle that
[18:22:43] <ravioli> i'm outputting to png

[18:51:09] <ravioli> a-HA
[18:51:40] <ravioli> ever look at old code you wrote like a year ago and wonder why you made certain decisions and also why you didn't properly document your spaghetti?
[18:52:58] <ravioli> just re-discovered something that i think is undocumented. it gets weird if the height is not a power of two. i don't think it cares about width in this case. just height. and if the height is not exactly a power of two, it gets all buggy
[18:54:04] <kepstin> if you're talking about the show spectrum stuff that kind of makes sense, it determines the number of buckets in the fft based on the image height iirc
[18:54:17] <kepstin> (and that wants to be a power of 2)
[18:54:37] <ravioli> seems like this should be written down somewhere

[21:22:03] <emcodem> @jeeb oh, videolan, so vlc has actually libzvbi?
[21:22:10] <JEEB> yes
[21:22:29] <JEEB> not 100% sure if it has its own teletext decoder, too, though
[21:22:32] <emcodem> oha, i was not aware about that ^^
[21:22:56] <emcodem> that might be really helpful too... all this teletext stuff is such a mess
[21:23:43] <emcodem> and subtitles even more
[21:24:26] <JEEB> ok, no. seems to indeed utilize zvbi as I recalled :)
[21:24:34] <JEEB> https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/blob/master/modules/codec/zvbi.c
[21:26:21] <emcodem> fuuuu...bar @BtbN, you must have spent some noticable amount of time with that, did you submit your patches to them?
[21:26:34] <BtbN> They ded
[21:26:51] <emcodem> damned
[21:27:16] <BtbN> Like, the last release is literally from 2013
[21:27:58] <BtbN> And those patches are the videolan ones, as noted in the commit, I didn't write them
[21:28:01] <emcodem> thats not good but i guess there is no alternative
[21:28:05] <JEEB> https://sourceforge.net/p/zapping/svn/HEAD/tree/
[21:28:09] <emcodem> ahh ok
[21:28:20] <JEEB> last update in 2017
[21:28:28] <emcodem> yeah
[21:28:29] <JEEB> which was a switch from CVS to SVN :D
[21:28:32] <BtbN> JEEB, that "update" was SF killing CVS
[21:28:34] <JEEB> yes
[21:29:19] <JEEB> I think tmm1 made a patch for a simple teletext decoder in FFmpeg
[21:29:51] <JEEB> but it was not clear whether people wanted that, or instead putting required zvbi code into FFmpeg
[21:30:08] <JEEB> wonder if videolan will fork zvbi :P
[21:30:18] <JEEB> since they already patch it if you look at their contribs
[21:30:44] <bencoh> it wouldn't even really be a "fork" at that point I guess :)
[21:30:47] <JEEB> https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc/-/tree/master/contrib/src/zvbi
[21:30:56] <bencoh> just stepping up for maintainership
[21:31:03] <emcodem> hehe well there are not too many other options i guess :D it's GNU license so it should be good to go, right?
[21:31:21] <BtbN> It's probably also riddled with poor code and a huge attack surface
[21:32:41] <emcodem> @bencoh, did i get that right that you wanna take it over?
[21:33:17] <bencoh> what? no, I don't, I was just referring to JEEB wondering if videolan would eventually "fork"
[21:33:22] <emcodem> :D

[23:58:38] <aphysically> I guess a good way to estimate the max bitrate re: sendable over SRT given x bandwidth restriction is to estimate based on the max GOP size
[23:59:11] <JEEB> dunno, I just set maxrate and bufsize when encoding :P
[23:59:45] <aphysically> encoding I've got it figured out, I was kinda interested in figuring it out for a random file
