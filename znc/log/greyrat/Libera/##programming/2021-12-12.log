[00:04:36] <phogg> gimp would know stuff like that, so doing a script-fu open, then manipulate frames as needed, then re-save from there might be easier

[00:05:30] <pulse> deniska, Might check that too, pyzozord mentioned it earlier
[00:05:48] <deniska> ffmpeg certainly knows how to deal with image sequences, not sure about gifs though
[00:05:49] <pulse> Didn't realize ffmpeg knows GIF
[00:06:02] <phogg> ffmpeg can convert an animated gif to individual frames and can convert to other video types, but I just don't know how well it supports saving off frame timing information

[00:09:32] <pyzozord> about frame timing information no idea
[00:09:44] <phogg> yeah, that's the real trick
[00:10:08] <pyzozord> but my general impression is that ffmpeg is the swissarmy knife of animated images
[00:10:20] <phogg> that's where it might be better to do a gimp script which just keeps all that in memory as it generates each frame, calls out to an upscale CLI tool, and then reads it back and overwrites the frame
[00:11:00] <deniska> it's kinda awkward how a lot of sites pretending to display gifs actually play videos instead, but you can't download "gif-like" video to them directly, you have to upload gif for them to transcode
[00:11:15] <phogg> turns out the last time I did .gif generation was 2012 and I didn't keep any of the shell code I wrote at the time. 
[00:11:30] <phogg> I really need to get better at remembering to save off my history
[00:12:28] <pyzozord> i suspect in ffmpeg you can export just the frame durations and later provide frame durations as argument when assembling the gif back from pictures

[00:39:31] <phogg> Many times in a codebase you will write functions which serve as a high level language around a series of primitive operations that you want to perform. You may not notice it as such, but it happens often. 
[00:39:45] <phogg> MVC frameworks pretty much always do this, for example
[00:40:06] <pyzozord> from what I understand, the problem with language-oriented programming is that it creates a high entry cost for new maintainers
[00:40:17] <pyzozord> who need to learn that dsl

[00:41:12] <pyzozord> just with the same syntax as the host language
[00:41:13] <phogg> exactly
[00:41:32] <phogg> this is what I mean by "but we do it badly"--we make these mini-languages, but with all of the baggage of the "host" language

[00:42:14] <pyzozord> on the other hand the "host" provides a familiar foundation in the form of syntax
[00:42:27] <phogg> true, and that's where good design comes in to it
[00:42:39] <phogg> if you have better taste you won't make something wildly different just because you can
[00:42:42] <phogg> your 
[00:42:47] <phogg> er, I'll start again...
[00:43:03] <pyzozord> right in the end it still boils down to the designer
[00:43:05] <phogg> your "DSL" may just be a simplified subset of what you would have had to write anyway, to reduce typing and overhead
[00:43:35] <pyzozord> ideas can be communicated badly even using simple and familira words
[00:43:48] <phogg> if you do it well anyone familiar with the host language and (to an extent) the application running context won't need to learn anything new to understand it
[00:44:13] <phogg> but tl;dr program design is *hard*, and library design is harder, and API design is incredibly hard
[00:44:55] <phogg> a little restraint when making your DSLs is a good idea

[01:08:24] <pyzozord> but I don't think that ada goes far enough on it's side. It still has dynamic memory and pointers, it shouldn't
[01:09:20] <flakland> it has addresses and access type, i guess addresses could be considered pointers since you can do arithmetic on them
[01:09:57] <flakland> but that enables the address_to_access_conversion, which is like a pointer cast in C
[01:09:59] <InPhase> flakland: Racket is basically a scheme derivative (which is a Lisp derivative focused on lexical scope), but with a bunch of added functionality like modern languages with rich libraries.  It has a bit more performance overhead than some of the faster scheme and lisp languages, but is generally within a small integer multiple of C performance.

[03:39:47] <sonny> A sites video player is buffering stuff with breaks, is that a bug?
[03:41:18] <nomagno> sonny: It's not necessarily a bug, it might be a performance issue with the network, your computer, a cosmic ray, or your kernel being starved for entropy ;)
[03:41:40] <sonny> the network?
[03:41:53] <nomagno> Well many video players support playing stuff over HTTP
[03:42:01] <nomagno> Or it might be the program being poorly optimized
[03:42:02] <sonny> it's like bytes are getting sent in with holes in them
[03:42:10] <nomagno> With holes?
[03:42:24] <sonny> yeah, when it hits a hole it buffers and fetches content
[03:42:24] <nomagno> I don't think that's very technical speech :P
[03:42:33] <nomagno> A hole?
[03:42:39] <sonny> you can see it in the player as well
[03:42:42] <nomagno> if bytes had holes the video wouldn't make sense
[03:42:52] <nomagno> It would be a color hot podge
[03:43:12] <nomagno> Instead of 01001011 you'd get 01000011

[06:20:44] <KillerWasp> OverCoder: It is possible to install from something already created, like wordpress, but you can also do it from scratch, although it takes much more time and it is more difficult to control the security of the website, since you need to cover all the possible holes that a website has.

[10:16:09] <CoderGuy> alright ready for the problem of the day?
[10:16:55] <CoderGuy> Lets say you wanted to split something multiple times & into seperate arrays so lets say you have 2 delims, ";" and ":"  what are some rules we can come up with for a multisplit function
[10:17:31] <CoderGuy> so for example the css parse function is going to have to deal with being seperated by a semi colon & also internally being seperated by a colon ";" and ":"
[10:17:57] <CoderGuy> so you have like "width:25px;height:20px;left:10"
[10:18:17] <decker> s.split(';').map(l=>split(':'))
[10:18:35] <decker> s.split(';').map(l=>l.split(':'))
[10:18:35] *** Quits: supernova (~quassel@2405:9800:ba11:6207:85ce:3956:d0d0:b7e7) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:18:35] <CoderGuy> and the resulting output you'd like is an array with the keys being width,height,left & the values being 25px,20px and 10
[10:18:47] <CoderGuy> decker but thats' just splitting it & then mapping it
[10:18:52] <CoderGuy> so you're running it twice
[10:19:04] <CoderGuy> I want something that at the point it splits it does the map part
[10:19:14] <decker> [...s].foreach...
[10:19:19] <CoderGuy> again running it twice
[10:19:26] <decker> which splits it once and scans it once so basically twice again
[10:19:36] <decker> that's what you get...
[10:19:53] <CoderGuy> no these are workarounds i'm trying to create something designed such that at the point it splits it does another split
[10:20:21] <CoderGuy> but here's the problem when attempting this way
[10:20:23] <decker> const obj = {}; (s.split(';').map(l=>l.split(':'))).map( v=>obj[v[0]]=v[1] ) )  and put it into an ojbect
[10:20:46] <CoderGuy> yeah but just listen okay cuz you're running things multiple times
[10:20:51] <decker> that's what that does... each segment is split with ';' and each of those split with ':'
[10:21:01] <stagas> what about the comments
[10:21:15] <CoderGuy> no, what htat does is it splits & then you run through your variable results & split again, then run through the results & split again
[10:21:20] <stagas> you're gonna run into trouble there
[10:21:53] <CoderGuy> here just listen to the question
[10:22:15] <CoderGuy> if for example you wanted to split twice but on the second split you also wanted to split twice, we're now in a bubble up problem
[10:22:52] *** Quits: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:22:59] <CoderGuy> so how can you control it in such a way that your input controls how it splits twice
[10:23:09] <CoderGuy> without limiting potential
[10:23:17] *** Joins: mei (~mei@user/mei)
[10:23:56] <CoderGuy> so you can both do the following split at ";" and then split at ":" but also first split at ";" second split at ":" but also in the second part split at "j" after it splits on the ":"
[10:24:01] <decker> const s=0,key=null,o={}; for( let c=0; c < str.len; c++ ) { if ( str[c] === ':' ) { key=str.substr(s,c-s); s=c; } if( str[c] === ';' ) { obj[key]=str.sbustr(s,c-s) s=c; }  
[10:24:17] <CoderGuy> yeah decker that's how I would do it for each one
[10:24:22] <CoderGuy> i'm asking for a function such that you can input it
[10:24:35] <CoderGuy> like on my own these are the functions I keep writing by hand
[10:24:43] *** Joins: Lenkov45 (~Lenkov45@45.133.193.24)
[10:24:45] <CoderGuy> I want one where I can just say like "listen split(";",":","j");
[10:24:56] <CoderGuy> but have infinite potential without issues
[10:25:39] <CoderGuy> maybe it's like you set the delims based on where they occure
[10:26:11] <decker> *shrug* TextParse https://github.com/d3x0r/-/blob/master/org.d3x0r.common/text.js#L90  can pass it punctuation marks to split on
[10:26:12] <bayaz> Title: -/text.js at master · d3x0r/- 
[10:26:22] *** Joins: flakland (~flaknet99@32.211.211.39)
[10:26:53] <decker> but it wouldn't know about the related/nesting grouping of the pairs... so you'd have to go through the list at the end grabbing paris of entries... otherwise it's a more custom parser
[10:27:07] <decker> like you oculdn't use the same thing on a CSV file
[10:27:42] <CoderGuy> right right
[10:27:48] <CoderGuy> ooo csv is a great example of this
[10:28:06] <CoderGuy> I think it works like you put the array with arrays in it for how to parse
[10:28:23] <decker> where mapping and recusive splits keeps pairs related
[10:28:46] <CoderGuy> soooo parse_entities[";",[":","j"]]
[10:30:21] <CoderGuy> and that says "for the first run, split on the semi colon, then in everything found, split on the colon ":" and everything found there split on the "j"
[10:30:57] <CoderGuy> now the returned output of this is kinda odd i'm not sure
[10:31:26] <CoderGuy> cuz it splits then it takes the key,value and splits on the key not sure how i'd specify to split on the value
[10:33:17] <CoderGuy> but I guess it'd be so for example AJD:B;CJD:E;  you'd have maybe [[[A,D],B],[[C,D],E]]  as the result hmm this kinda looks like a json parse
[10:33:37] <CoderGuy> hold on maybe this is just json
[10:35:31] <CoderGuy> in any event, the real question is what output is being formed by splitting multiple times & what are the rules for said output

[14:37:00] <ent58> ideally the way this is implemented is that you have true code objects, and in something like c++, that would represent the state of something like a super-inline function that retains all of the state necessary to modify its endpoints with full optimization

[16:06:33] <mrig> I'm not fond of the incoherent keyboard mapping that this makes. 
[16:07:06] <mrig> think that keyboard ought to be considered as seriously as the positioning of close buttons and the likes, if no more so.
[16:07:38] <mercenary> mrig: just compile your terminal to webasm and run it in the browser, no more switching between terminal and browser ;)
[16:07:43] <mrig> just because you cant see it and a lot of people cant type, does not make it less important to those who can.
[16:08:02] <mrig> mercenary: the browser walks all over key bindings. :(
[16:08:51] <mercenary> that...may be a problem yes
[16:09:07] <mrig> I'd like to put the keyboard above the mouse in the stack
[16:09:40] <mrig> really do think that favoring the mouse so heavily has been a monumental mistake.

[16:18:40] <decker> no such thing
[16:18:51] <decker> if there is - it's a bad app designer.

[16:19:08] <mrig> oh this is very true yes.
[16:19:31] <mrig> Yes it could well be that it is only due to the way that people think when they code.

[16:22:53] <mrig> that is not mouse oriented.

[19:03:46] <Geolykt> Ideally the client and server should accept a strictly defined set of  "commands", though this approach can fall appart pretty fast depending on the type of the connection

[19:03:56] <KillerWasp> Geolykt: I really don't know if I should worry so much about it, JS also allows remote code execution, which makes any operating system totally vulnerable. Maybe I should do the same with C/C++ and each load strange code as if it were reliable.

[19:07:31] <Geolykt> However my approach would be to ignore this issue, if the user wishes to install malware, then they should be able to do it
[19:07:45] <sonny> just give the user commands, not code?
[19:08:33] <sonny> remote code execution just seems really difficult otherwise

[19:15:54] <KillerWasp> I always thought that there's no security, it's only about making things more difficult for hackers. But from there to facilitate the access even more to the Trojans, I don't know if that would be right. And then make users execute strange code manufactured by others and that everything is under their own responsibility to decide if said code is trustworthy or not.
[19:17:03] <Geolykt> In todays world noone cares about security anyways; it's more or less just a marketing trick

[20:41:04] <mercenary> let me find a post-morten, the a part of the tl;dr was that something went wrong in their network, and all nameservers decided 'I can see something is wrong, let me not respond instead of responding with possibly out-of-date information'
[20:41:47] <mercenary> That led to severly limited visibility into things, access control mechanisms failing, etc.

[21:25:27] <InPhase> average: McDonalds corporate likely makes agreement with the franchise owners that factor in rent and profit levels on each burger sold, where they shift a little more of the profit stream that gets passed upward over toward rent to incentivize the franchise owners to stabilize corporate profits and to encourage franchise owners to take the necessary steps to keep local sales up.

[23:18:34] <jeaye> I've been in companies where people with 2 years of experience are "Senior devs" and others where people with over 10 years of experience are not yet senior.
[23:18:43] <gry> i do not get it why they cant spend a few hours finding someone good who has no experience prior
[23:18:52] <gry> and is keen
[23:19:12] <dodo> jeaye: to be fair, in the right env you can learn more in two years than others in ten..

[23:19:41] <dodo> yeah, didn't think so ;)
[23:19:49] <jeaye> You're right about that, though.
[23:19:56] <dodo> man, working on a great team is so.. great
[23:21:00] <pyzozord> I'd say it's more like "in bad environment you can learn less in 10 years than in normal environment in 2 years"
[23:21:15] <dodo> it's all relative
[23:21:43] <jeaye> Also depends on the dev. 9-5 enterprise work can allow 10 years to fly right by.
[23:21:59] <jeaye> While their own teammates are learning a whole lot more, due to their interest.
[23:22:02] <Square> pulse, i watch  lindybeige sometimes too. Theres a bunch of good history youtubers
[23:22:09] <pyzozord> much more likely to find a dead end that doesn provide any learning opportunities, than a place that teaches you amazing things all the time
[23:22:21] <pyzozord> unless you are just starting out
[23:22:33] <dodo> i'm in dead end right now.. four days left on the contract
[23:23:17] <pyzozord> I was too over the last year, but at least I laerned few new soft skills and understood a bit more about how corporations actually function
[23:23:35] <dodo> yeah, i did lots of training for juniors, was interesting
[23:23:52] <dodo> though i've been doing support on irc for so long.. barely learned anything new
[23:24:25] <pyzozord> also I discovered that it's thougher to learn new things as you progress
[23:24:40] <dodo> easier if you can branch out
[23:24:55] <dodo> also the things you learn tend to get more valuable, imo
[23:25:15] <pyzozord> I think at some point you start shifting focus from external opprotunities for learning to creating your own opportunities and more deliverately choosing subjects you want to learn on your own by yourself

[23:28:30] <deniska> (but better than a master of one)
[23:28:33] <pyzozord> I think it's best to have as much of both wide and deep as possible

[23:31:22] <jeaye> We're a big org with a lot of teams; it helps to have people who are willing to move around as necessary. Specialists are more likely to become siloed, which isn't good for their career growth and isn't as good of an investment for the company.
