[05:21:08] <zumba_addict> Good evening folks. Do you have any idea why sometimes, attaching this usb stick(that previously mounts) will fail to be mounted? The error in /var/log/messages shows `mtp-probe: bus: 2, device: 56 was not an MTP device`. The only  way to fix it is reboot linux :(
[05:21:44] <zumba_addict> I tried another usb reader and it's showing the same error
[05:22:07] <zumba_addict> i also tried creating a udel rule without luck
[05:22:58] <zumba_addict> I've also commented out PTP in libmtp something with no luck
[05:24:52] <zumba_addict> I'll check if webcam and mic usb based are still working

[05:34:23] <zumba_addict> i haven't tried but i always just stick to the usb port and in a second or 2, it will get mounted
[05:34:42] <kee> What desktop environment?
[05:34:49] <zumba_addict> no, I always click eject button in file manager
[05:34:54] <zumba_addict> xfce
[05:35:20] <kee> That uses the xdg things underneath, right? (Should say in task manager)
[05:35:36] <zumba_addict> what i noticed though today is that I clicked eject button while terminal was still inside the usb stick. So I went outside and clicked eject and it was successfully unmounted
[05:35:44] <zumba_addict> i am not sure about xdg
[05:36:10] <zumba_addict> i can try mounting it manually
[05:36:51] <kee> Yeah, I was getting mixed up anyway. I don't think there's any mounting program with xdg in the name.

[05:38:07] <zumba_addict> got it
[05:38:10] <kee> Okay, that sounds like hardware failure to me.
[05:38:16] <zumba_addict> got it
[05:38:17] <kee> Next time it works, make a backup.
[05:38:24] <zumba_addict> so looks like I'll have to reboot to make it work

[05:47:30] <e3d3> kee: according to the maker is the program a simple GUI that decode base64 serial input from a (Arduino) camera into a image. The developer don't talk about Window versions but although the program is from 2019 do I guess that it also work in XP or Win98
[05:48:07] <kee> If it's from 2019, it's unlikely to work in Windows 98.
[05:48:19] <kee> Do you have the source code?
[05:48:25] <e3d3> no, too bad
[05:48:40] <kee> It shouldn't be too hard to write your own, anyway.
[05:48:49] <kee> It *sounds* like a relatively simple Python script.
[05:48:57] <kee> Is there two-way communication?
[05:49:17] <kee> Or does the program just listen to the serial port?
[05:50:07] *** Joins: lsrtl_ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl)
[05:50:44] <e3d3> No it also captures the base64 encode and decodes it to form an image.

[05:51:30] <e3d3> but it only listens on the serial port. It doesn't send commands

[05:51:50] <jensen> preseeding only allows grub bootloader, right? I want to use systemd-boot, in which case network install from minimal CD is the only option for me?
[05:52:33] <kee> e3d3: Good news! You can listen on the serial port using `cat`, or your shell directly.

[05:53:09] *** Quits: Darius10467 (~getting@user/Darius10467) (Quit: leaving)
[05:53:24] <kee> Once you find the serial settings that give you usable base64, you can then run that through a base64 decoder, then a tool to turn raw bytes into an image.
[05:54:00] <kee> That last bit is the only relatively hard part, but the netpbm formats are simple enough if you end up needing to make your own.
[05:54:53] <e3d3> kee: I know, but I have no program to convert the with an Arduino generated base64 input, and am too lazy cq stupid to make it myself. I have decode base64 into image but never into a live video
[05:55:27] <kee> What's your favourite programming language?
[05:56:45] <e3d3> kee: assembly but I use that rarely, Bash shell scripting is not my favorite but it is most productive. Tcl is my new love for anything GUI related
[05:56:53] <kee> Your choices (as I see them) are ½ to 2 hours programming a program that shows images on the screen as soon as it receives them, or 1 to 6 hours trying to wrangle a partial Wine install / virtual machines.
[05:57:05] <kee> I think Tcl/Tk can definitely do that.
[05:57:25] <kee> I wouldn't've thought of using it, actually, but you can probably throw something together faster than I could with Python or C.
[05:58:00] <e3d3> I have/want to do maybe too much, and don't know if this camera experiment is worth this effort
[05:58:23] <kee> You could convert the image to coloured pixels using ANSI codes, then set your terminal font size really small.
[05:59:05] <kee> But Tk seems easier. https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/image.html
[05:59:08] <e3d3> kee: I use 'Kitty' as terminal, that can display images, like xterm
[05:59:25] <kee> But it's a bit of a pain to output images to a terminal.
[05:59:37] <kee> Unless, actually, there's probably a shell command for that, isn't there?
[06:00:47] <e3d3> I rarely display image directly with Kitty, which has its own commands for that, but I use it always in Ranger (CLI file manager) for instand image previews
[06:00:55] *** Joins: plitz (~user@191.190.32.76)
[06:00:57] <kee> Tk could take half an hour, shell might take 10 minutes (depending on how long it takes you to make a loop to load multiple base64 images, one after another).
[06:01:06] <e3d3> or in a CLI webbrowser
[06:01:27] <kee> What program did you use to decode the images before?

[06:04:05] <kee> Anyway, this is all stuff you can work out. Getting a Windows program to run, with working serial ports, would take more effort I think.

[13:45:26] <labrador> why
[13:45:40] <labrador> its worse compared to wayland

[13:46:02] <Khepra> in practice, wayland compositors are buggy.

[13:47:11] <labrador> Haohmaru, into say kwin. Now normal programs cannot control windows but you can still control kwin
[13:47:25] <labrador> Such weirder x11 use cases can be covered by merging them into the compositors
[13:47:33] <Haohmaru> dafuq is kwin? it sounds KDE-ish

[13:48:02] <Khepra> "it's gonna suck".   I tried kde on bullseye few months ago, specifically for wayland, and it was "literally unplayable", how buggy that was.
[13:48:05] <labrador> The screenshot thing was added into them too
[13:48:12] <labrador> Becuz normal programs couldn't do it anymore
[13:48:23] <labrador> Haohmaru, lmao
[13:48:24] <Khepra> gnome's mutter is currently the bestest wayland compositor there is. hardly a bug.
[13:48:37] <labrador> Khepra, kde always plays catchup....

[13:49:26] <Khepra> I reckon it's comparatively understaffed.
[13:50:06] <labrador> I dunno I think it might be because its trying to do much more than mutter
[13:50:23] <labrador> Mutter has very little features
[13:52:08] <Khepra> when it comes to wayland, technically the same set of features is supported in both. KDE only exposes many more of them via UI, gnome hardcodes some decisions in the engine and default configs.

[13:54:17] <Haohmaru> labrador so, if your program wants to control its size and position, you'd have to implement it for kwin and for mutter, and then it'll only work on KDE and gnome
[13:54:34] <labrador> Haohmaru, yeah
[13:54:39] <Haohmaru> "wonderful"
[13:54:41] <labrador> Thats the price you need to pay for security
[13:54:43] <c7s> of course a program can control its size, how else would video players work
[13:54:48] <labrador> I think its beautiful

[13:56:43] <labrador> You cannot really hack stuff on jankily in android
[13:56:55] <labrador> Like you could in x11
[13:57:12] <Haohmaru> don't give android as an example to me, as i'm not familiar at all
[13:57:27] <labrador> Haohmaru, wait really?
[13:57:28] <labrador> lmao
[13:57:33] <Haohmaru> yes, really
[13:57:44] <labrador> ok
[13:58:03] <Haohmaru> i don't see myself CAD'ing on a smortphone
[13:58:06] <c7s> the good thing about wayland is it being clear which program is repsonsible for what, rather than applications fighting each other to configure the display and window managers begging for keyboard grabs, the bad thing is gnome not really being cooperative in general, e.g. not implementing the idle-inhibit protocol

[14:01:37] <Haohmaru> "wonderful" number two
[14:01:38] <labrador> More with wayland cuz the compositors start doing much more
[14:01:54] <labrador> Haohmaru, security and stability
[14:02:03] <labrador> Thats what wayland offers
[14:02:10] <labrador> x11 has so much jank
[14:02:41] <labrador> Haohmaru, who do you think is even going to maintain x11 after wayland takes off tho?
[14:02:47] <Haohmaru> okay, so no need to look into wayland any time soon then
[14:03:04] <c7s> wayland isn't security magic, it just means it doesn't have some inherent problems, you still need to do other things if you want a secure system
[14:03:35] <labrador> c7s, yea it doesn't remain stuck to a 50y/o protocol that is inherently insecure. Ofc you can still shoot urself in the foot with wayland
[14:03:53] <c7s> as for that stuff above, you're not going to be able to run e.g. KDE's taskbar on gnome because gnome don't implement the layer shell protocol
[14:04:09] <labrador> lmaoo
[14:04:23] <labrador> Gnome doesn't seem to implement anything
[14:04:44] <labrador> Its extensions are also pretty monolithic compared to KDEs...
[14:04:48] <Haohmaru> so we're down to a choice among 1 options? kde?
[14:04:56] <labrador> Haohmaru, yeah
[14:04:58] <labrador> kde or sway
[14:05:02] <labrador> Choose your master
[14:05:06] <Haohmaru> no
[14:05:08] <Haohmaru> LXDE
[14:05:15] <labrador> Haohmaru, thats kde too
[14:05:16] <labrador> kinda
[14:05:20] <Haohmaru> eh?
[14:05:22] <labrador> It takes a lot of help from them
[14:05:29] <labrador> wait thats lxde
[14:05:36] <labrador> Thats abandoned Haohmaru
[14:05:41] <labrador> lxqt is the new version
[14:06:02] <Haohmaru> right, even that's better than KDE
[14:06:11] <labrador> Haohmaru, its pretty much the same
[14:06:16] <Haohmaru> no
[14:06:24] <labrador> how so?
[14:06:39] <labrador> I have no idea Haohmaru why you hate kde....
[14:06:46] <Haohmaru> when i see gnome or kde i wanna vomit aggressively, in two different ways
[14:06:51] <labrador> why?
[14:07:51] <Haohmaru> difficult to explain, i want something simple and fast that looks roughly like old computer UIs from the 90s-ish
[14:07:58] <Haohmaru> say win98
[14:08:09] <labrador> ew
[14:08:11] <labrador> fugly
[14:08:12] <Haohmaru> i absolutely hate the new fancy flat UIs
[14:08:30] <c7s> xfce was nice until 4.16, then they changed some stuff that I like less
[14:08:31] <Haohmaru> animations.. stupid effects..
[14:08:41] <labrador> Haohmaru, they make it look more pleasant
[14:09:01] <c7s> but those kinds of UIs are nice
[14:09:15] <c7s> I find that animations usually make things feel slower than they need to
[14:09:33] <Haohmaru> animations is the absolute dumbest thing
[14:09:35] <c7s> e.g. gnome-clocks fades between the different "screens", which takes time, and is annoying once you notice it
[14:09:45] <labrador> c7s, yeah without them it does snap...but in a very janky way
[14:09:48] <labrador> atleast for me
[14:09:56] <andro> <Haohmaru> i absolutely hate the new fancy flat UIs >>> me too
[14:10:00] <labrador> Like just abruptly changing looks weird to me
[14:10:06] <labrador> Maybe a fade-in
[14:10:07] <c7s> animations that's are informative like when you change from one workspace to another is useful
[14:10:21] <c7s> abruptly changing I'm fine with as long as it corresponds to a keypress or something
[14:10:43] <andro> i like the old skeuomorphic windows icons with the crusty dithering
[14:10:45] <Haohmaru> i may have better tasks for my CPU to compute than silly UI animations and effects
[14:11:23] <Haohmaru> i understand some people wanna have that, but it needs to be optional
[14:11:25] <labrador> Haohmaru, then why don't we start using ttys man
[14:11:36] <labrador> Why would I want my cpu to compute silly graphics
[14:11:41] <c7s> ;p

[19:45:40] <dpkg> Khepra: I give up, what is it?
[19:46:24] <jelly> kee, most protocols use a single port as endpoint to connect to.  ftp uses at least two connections, and crossing NAT requires a stateful, clueful firewall to allow ftp to still keep working
[19:46:25] <kee> shtrb: WebSockets does that too. So do most P2P filesharing protocols; it's not unusual.

[19:47:25] <shtrb> Ueb, check your server logs

[19:50:09] <jelly> then you don't know how ftp works
[19:50:10] <Khepra> you don't need state tracking. you can portforward a range.

[19:50:41] <Khepra> so?
[19:50:44] <jelly> Khepra, not only you need state tracking, you need specific protocol munging
[19:50:51] <kee> Khepra: That limits the maximum number of connections, too.
[19:50:53] <Khepra> jelly: you don't
[19:50:54] <shtrb> just open everything above 1023

[19:51:58] <Ueb> FileZilla client on Windows works.. it can connect and upload/download files to that server... the problem is the Debian client

[19:56:32] <shtrb> your client is broken ..
[19:56:43] <Khepra> I heard in the past that filezilla was horribly broken on linux.
[19:56:54] <karlpinc> Ueb: If you're using filezilla does it not do sftp?
[19:56:54] <jelly> I _think_ lftp defaults to active mode
[19:57:15] <jelly> Ueb, good, problem solved that?
[19:57:22] <jelly> s/that/then/
[19:57:32] <Ueb> this is the response of dir command:
[19:57:36] <Ueb> ---- Address returned by PASV seemed to be incorrect and has been fixed
[19:57:59] <jelly> that's because ftp sucks and lftp knows that ftp sucks
[19:58:42] <shtrb> lol
[19:59:40] <jelly> sometimes that fix works.  Other times you're behind a double NAT / CGNAT, and it's not enough to fix the IP and leave the port number intact, and you're screwed
[19:59:47] <Ueb> jelly this is the FTP response after opening a connection:  ftp: setsockopt: Bad file descriptor

[23:26:27] <GenTooMan> I apologize for the long messed but detailed messages tend to get interrupted on IRC. I've been trying to deal with a misbehaved application, I have to "deal" with it as few alternatives exist. It has 3 areas that categorize it as misbehaving. First creates 9 sub-processes with a main process (this makes it hard to use a process manager to reduce memory consumption as well as know just how much of the system is being eaten up
[23:26:27] <GenTooMan> by it). Second the memory allocation is ludicrously high. With 8gigs of ram 4gigs of ram and 3 gigs of swap are consumed by it. Thirdly it arbitrarily begins consuming processor time when it's not directly in use. It doesn't seem the memory is an issue in terms of a memory leak. I suspect the developers have a perverse way of thinking about how their application is used.

[23:30:58] <GenTooMan> Khepra, LOL yes suggestions on how to beat the application into not using up all resources for itself.
[23:31:42] <GenTooMan> I could really use some on it. Ugh I have looked at process memory reduction apps but those only work on a single process.
[23:31:43] <Khepra> put it in a cgroup
[23:32:05] <Khepra> you can use systemd-run to start something in a slice, and you can limit the slice with cgroup options
[23:33:02] <GenTooMan> ah thanks a kick in the right direction is always welcome.

[23:59:05] <somiaj> It appears that is the case. So just wait. There maybe a channel on oftc you can use to ping a developer about it, though I assume they may know
