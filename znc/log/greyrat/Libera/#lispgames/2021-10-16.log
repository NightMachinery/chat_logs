[01:30:04] <shoshin> tx. i lost my bouncer and stopped hanging around irc for a while
[02:27:25] <shoshin> technomancy: do you have some info about the fennel tic-80 connection? it looks like in your script so far there's some sections for data like <TILES> etc. wondering how the sound might get in there
[02:45:49] <shoshin> seems like writing the sound changes the binary blob at the top of the tic file
[02:51:59] <technomancy> shoshin: oh yeah sorry I didn't explain that very well; what I normally do is `save bloip.fnl` and it will save all the binary assets out to that <TILES> style comment in text
[02:53:10] <technomancy> tic saves to ~/.local/share/com.nesbox.tic/TIC-80 by default but I symlink my local checkout to that dir to streamline things
[02:54:24] <shoshin> technomancy: oh ok, so i can just open up the bloip.fnl with TIC-80 and directly add music to the cart through the UI?
[02:55:26] <technomancy> that should do the trick but without the symlink it'll probably save it back into ~/.local/... so look there if you can't find your changes
[02:55:54] <technomancy> alternately if you're only making changes to audio assets you can email me the binary .tic file and I'll merge it in myself; I don't mind =)
[02:56:40] <shoshin> ok. cool. i'd like to checkout the game work as well, but we'll see how much time i get. i just got ~26 minutes now and managed to get another little melody worked out =)
[02:59:05] <shoshin> i can handle the symlinking too i think. i'll see if i can get that going before i break
[03:01:49] <shoshin> hrm. cart loading error

[03:19:44] <Icefoz> Anyone have any recommendations for Lua/Fennel ECS's?  I probably should have found one before the jam started, but I was just like "eh I'll write one"
[03:19:50] <Icefoz> now I'm writing one and am like "wow this is a waste of time"
[03:20:47] <technomancy> I doubt you'll see the benefits of an ECS for a jam-sized game
[03:23:48] <Icefoz> I mean, it doesn't need to be a fancy one.  It's just how I'm used to thinking about game structure.
[03:24:48] <technomancy> I haven't tried https://github.com/bakpakin/tiny-ecs but if I had to use an ECS I'd start there
[03:25:41] <Icefoz> Yeah, was considering that.  It'll probably do for now.

[12:12:49] <borodust> mfiano: no worries, my comment was for the author :)
[12:17:16] <borodust> I also don't feel offended or anything and kinda glad there was a link to alien-works there
[12:17:28] <borodust> but this gist is weird
[12:19:57] <mfiano> Yes lol
[12:31:20] <selwyn> hi everyone
[12:32:18] <selwyn> i heard recently about progress with claw and it seems very promising and exciting
[12:32:41] <selwyn> made me wonder if in principle you could expose ue4 in cl using it
[12:35:02] <borodust> hi selwyn
[12:35:05] <selwyn> hi
[12:35:26] <borodust> yup, it pretty much works for c++ libs now
[12:35:31] <selwyn> great!
[12:36:46] <borodust> but i dont think its possible or convenient to use ue4 from CL
[12:37:05] <selwyn> i had the idea of exposing it with clasp
[12:37:11] <selwyn> but thats more of a novelty hack
[12:37:42] <borodust> you can't embed it into projects - your project is gonna be embedded into it
[12:38:46] <borodust> best you can do is compile Lisp to shared lib and add to the ue project
[12:39:14] <borodust> but then interactivity is pretty much lost
[12:39:45] <selwyn> can't you run a repl from that shared lib?
[12:39:50] <borodust> so its not exposing UE into CL, but backwards :)
[12:41:33] <borodust> selwyn: probably possible, but you would operate inside UE process, not sure how that will go
[12:42:02] <borodust> bytecode would work though
[12:42:19] <borodust> ECL maybe
[12:42:45] <borodust> but I also heard UE aint friendly for that sort of thing
[12:42:47] <selwyn> like there would be interrupts and stuff in sbcl?
[12:43:04] <borodust> yeh, most likely
[12:44:24] <borodust> i researched that topic fairly long ago, maybe something had changed
[12:44:55] <borodust> but i scrapped the idea
[12:45:10] <selwyn> right 
[12:45:12] <selwyn> :(
[12:45:25] * mfiano needs someone to empty his scrapped idea bin
[12:45:26] <borodust> i remember ppl do stuff with pharo and ue4 through memory mapped stuff
[12:45:52] <selwyn> had some fantasies of getting clasp+ue4 on the ps5
[12:46:34] <borodust> https://youtu.be/6fsUKW8-bBE
[12:47:28] <borodust> selwyn: you might have better luck than myself, so dont let my failures stop you!
[12:47:42] <selwyn> hm, well, if ue4 is doing the hard work, then maybe ecl bytecode wouldn't be bad
[12:57:32] <selwyn> is physx fully exposed?
[13:01:04] <selwyn> i am in the market for a physics engine in common lisp
[13:15:09] <borodust> it probably yes :)
[13:15:27] <borodust> i made only a toy example
[13:15:43] <borodust> but gonna do smth more elaborate for the jam game
[13:15:59] <borodust> with physx, that is
[13:16:46] <selwyn> i see
[13:18:11] <selwyn> cannot really enter the game jam this time but hoping to present trial-vr at the next els

[23:56:40] <Icefoz> It runs for 10 days.
[23:57:05] <dto> hmm. hi Icefoz how many days are already happened? 
[23:57:13] <Icefoz> This is the first one.

[23:57:22] <dto> oh nice. perhaps i'll join in !
[23:57:31] <borodust> dto: looks trippy ;p
[23:57:50] <dto> i might enable the background and ditch the chromakey for some games yeah
[23:57:52] <dto> hi borodust !
[23:58:21] <borodust> hi!
[23:58:26] <dthompson> this weekend is very busy for me, but I have made a little progress on a jam entry.
[23:58:33] <dto> oh hey dthompson 
[23:59:21] <dto> i wonder if i could simply use Xelf as-is , it still works and all. might be a simpler way to get it done
[23:59:27] <dto> than trying to port xelf to new libs
