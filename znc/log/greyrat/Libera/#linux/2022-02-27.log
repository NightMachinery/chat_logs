[02:19:40] <koollman> msiism: do note that  I was showing the example from cd to iso, just to explain that the content is presented in the same way. to go to the optical medium, a burning program is preferable
[02:19:57] <Gustavo6046> what am I going to say? that Discord voice chat is broken in my system and the Ripcord alternative client doesn't support video at all yet?
[02:20:03] <msiism> koollman: Oh, right, got it backwards.
[02:20:06] <Gustavo6046> I mean I can explain that

This file was all written at once (but maybe the tool writing it split it up into multiple writes?) and the FS was mounted with "compress" the whole time.

[05:02:14] <koollman> I don't know about zoned devices, but it may force more extent for various reasons
[05:03:01] <koollman> also a file is rarely written 'all at once', or at least rarely preallocated in a single extent, depends one the available free space structures , most large files end up as multiple extents

[05:06:08] <cheapie> alMalsamo: Supposedly Linux can run on there, not sure if the Linux support for native mode is part of the official kernel or not but it should run in x86 mode either way.

[05:07:27] <cheapie> koollman: This confuses me a bit about what the page said regarding when it decides to compress a given file or not, in that case - is it deciding separately whether or not to compress each group of blocks, unless the first one was a "no", in which case it doesn't even try the rest?

[17:17:20] <ananke> rahl-: single words can be often translated using google translate. then with something like vscode you can rename/refactor those in all of the relevant files at once
[17:17:23] * DLange tries with a / again
[17:17:30] <blackgatonegro> rahl- that could go wrong, so very wrong. If a wrong name gets replaced you can ruin the whole thing. More so if the code is written in English and some English word is part of the code instead of just the language text.
[17:18:00] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[17:18:01] <DLange> rahl-: the common way is to write the software in English and use gettext (.po files) to translate user-visible strings

[17:18:59] <DLange> may be look up whether gettext works for your programming language and convert the source to proper multi-language over essentially forking for two languages

[17:20:22] <ananke> rahl-: ok, then certainly vscode's rename feature would work just fine
[17:20:33] <rahl-> Most of the code is for an android app, so user strings I can deal with via `android studio`
[17:20:43] <blackgatonegro> rahl- then is less likely the code language will have that problem but is still risky, you will have to figure what parts of the code display text on the screen and replace the language there. Depending on the programing language used; there are several ways to do that.
[17:20:43] <rahl-> But there are a ton of variable names in Indonesian
[17:20:58] <ananke> vscode will do intelligent rename, as opposed to using sed

[17:51:37] <Two_Dogs> i agree with labrador , in respect to what to teach a child about linux, give them a game(arch) and tell them it can do anything(build the system), show them where the book(archwiki) is and let them go, they have built toys(android/ios/ipad/MS) to use as reading tools
[17:51:42] <Mathisen> how to exlude the . dir with find. exmaple: i have folder1 with 2 fildes in it and folder2 with 3 files in it. then i want " find | wc --lines " to return 7 but it will be 8 when it includes the .

[20:19:29] <wroathe> This is such a vital feature for me that I might need to undertake the development to get this into gnome
[20:19:52] <wroathe> I'm transitioning away from OSX to Linux full time now :D
[20:20:01] <rascul> why do that when you can just use guake or one of the various other similar things?
[20:20:59] <rascul> the capability does exist even if it's not necessarily built directly into gnome and/or gnome-terminal
[20:21:18] <wroathe> I haven't fully made up my mind yet. My immediate concern is that there seems to be too many options for terminal emulators on linux, and that fragmented community I could see leading to a lack of real development capacity to maintain any of them in the long term
[20:21:35] <wroathe> To some degree gnome being the default makes it the most popular and most well maintained

[20:24:18] <ThinkT510> you can always try different desktop environments and window managers until you find something you like
[20:24:21] <labrador> GNOME is an ok de
[20:24:28] <user95> I'm scratching my head because a command I found on SO failed even though it looks right to me. could I get a second set eyes please? this is what I ran:
[20:24:28] <labrador> Thats all you can say about it ig
[20:24:29] <user95> mksquashfs bak srv-60g-crypt.img -p 'sdb_backup.img f 444 root ro
[20:24:29] <user95> ot dd if=/dev/sdb bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress'
[20:24:33] <hexnewbie> No wonder year of Linux on the desktop is never coming, though KDE (while better) is buggy, crashing, complex and confusing so it wouldn't have been helping anyone, either
[20:25:05] <user95> ended in: "Failed to read file sdb_backup.img, creating empty file"
[20:25:18] <wroathe> hexnewbie: Right. Ultimately I don't care about "special snowflake" points. I just want something stable that does what I want it to do with a justified amount of effort.
[20:25:35] <user95> it did read and compress the whole disk, it just then silently dropped it or something....
[20:25:48] <wroathe> If gnome terminal already does 95% of what I want it to do, and it's the most popular terminal emulator on linux, then it would make sense to think about extending it to shore up that 5%.
[20:26:35] <hexnewbie> KDE is quite stable when you learn where all the potholes are and learn to drive around them.
[20:27:15] <user95> now, mksquashfs does not even suggest this use case, option -p creates a pseudodevice (chardev). did it fail because the output of dd status got in the way of my disk data?
[20:27:16] <wroathe> Yeah, I might end up going that route. I just want to fully evaluate gnome first before jumping ship.

[20:37:38] <wroathe> And that shows me that the machinery is there. I need to dig into the gnome terminal issue tracker and codebase and figure out what the story for making that a preference rather than something modal is.
[20:38:39] <wroathe> Why is gnome 3 such a microsoft-ism? And why is wayland being hailed as such an improvement (I've come to learn over the last 24 hours that it's the new hotness, but does that inherently make it better than the previous solutions?)

[22:30:53] <nicholaus04> It's mostly turned off for a few reasons, with one being that on some moniters, it takes up screen space in the TTY, and also, not all systems support it unless you change the "Framebuffer Deffer Takeover" flag.
