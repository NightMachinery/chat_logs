[00:08:45] <Bayes> From a book I found that `transpose(inverse(A)) = inverse(transpose(A))`. Now, if A is symmetric, then `transpose(inverse(A)) = inverse(A)`. Am I reading this right?

[02:45:21] <Z-module> biberao: you should just try carrying out the proof, it's not hard. Say (x_n) -> L.  That means: for every eps > 0, some natural N exists such that forall n >= N,  |x_n - L| < eps.  Now fix the natural number d and set y_n = x_(n+d)  for all n.  Pick any eps > 0, and take the N that works in (x_n) for this eps, and check now that for all n >= N,  |y_n - L| < eps.  So we get (y_n) -> L.  The other direction (assuming (y_n) -> L and
[02:45:21] <Z-module> proving (x_n) -> L )   is only very slightly more involved.

[02:51:22] <Z-module> biberao: the way I like to picture it is:  (x_n) -> z  means: for any open interval J containing z, no matter how tiny, eventually *all* the x_n terms (for all n beyond some point) are inside J.  That should make your thing clear.
[02:52:11] <Z-module> the epsilon-N definition is the same as requiring these intervals J to be *centered* at z, but actually that's an unimportant details.

[04:23:50] <rex> I am to solve a Bernoullie equation for the intervall (-∞, 1/2 ln 3), I have the solution and have already found that 1/2 ln 3 is a hole in the definition
[04:24:15] <rex> But how do I know if it is (-∞, p) or (p, ∞)
[04:24:17] <rex> ?
[04:24:37] <horon> mh_le Shit ? That sounds so much like Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho...
[04:25:02] <mh_le> but that means that as along at a space is locally homeomorphic to R^k it's automatically Hausdorff?
[04:25:17] <mh_le> horon: :D
[04:25:52] <cherim__> Technically one maybe has to add some more words for a clear argument for RP^n being Hausdorff
[04:25:55] <rex> Doesn't Hausdorff mean that different points have different neighborhoods?
[04:27:27] <horon> rex I'm more fluent in French, so I may getting Hausdorff wrong. To me Hausdorff is existence of disjoint neighborhoods.
[04:27:45] <rex> yeah I think so too
[04:27:50] <horon> mh_le to my knowledge, pretty much, yeah.
[04:28:11] <cherim__> It is the usual definition, but how do you proceed?
[04:28:22] <cherim__> I understand that the fact is weak and has many easy proofs
[04:28:36] <horon> cherim__ I do not see what you criticize in my "proof".
[04:28:50] <cherim__> Still, two points need not a priori lie in preimage of some map
[04:29:36] <horon> cherim__ I never talked about preimages of maps. Dunno what you're getting at.
[04:29:39] <cherim__> So I have p1 and p2 points of RP^n. I also know that any point has a neighboorhood homeomorphic to R^n
[04:29:42] <cherim__> So what?
[04:30:05] <[itchyjunk]> hello
[04:30:08] <cherim__> I can immediately derive that p1 has a neighborhood disjoint from p2, maybe
[04:30:21] <horon> cherim___ ah. ok.

[06:22:13] <PlanckWalk> Anyway, the main problem is that p2 might have neither N nor X-N as neighbourhoods.
[06:22:15] <Z-module> even if you assume hausdorff and cardinality c, a locally euclidean space can fail to be metrizable. That's why the typically include 2nd-countable (or equivalently, paracompact) as part of the definition of a manifold.
[06:23:19] <buster> Z-module, just thinking aloud, I expect you're right. If (N, f) is a neighbourhood of one origin 0_a and a homeomorphism to R^n, then N a neighbourhood of both origins, so f(0_a) \ne f(0_b) but f(0_a) and f(0_b) are not separated by neighbourhoods ... ?
[06:24:14] <buster> PlanckWalk, that's the "suppose not" part
[06:24:43] <PlanckWalk> It wasn't clear which assumption is being negated with the "suppose not"
[06:25:06] <buster> hence the colon :)
[06:25:09] <Z-module> In the line with two origins, for every open set U containing 0_a and every open set V containing 0_b, the intersection U cap V is uncountable. That's how badly hausdorffness fails for {0_a, 0_b}
[06:25:42] <buster> right, but it's not locally homeomorphic to R^n either ... is it?
[06:25:56] <Z-module> (but hausdorffness fails for no other pair of points )
[06:26:46] <Z-module> every connected open set U in X (the line with two origins) is =~ R as long as 0_a, 0_b aren't both in U
[06:26:55] <PlanckWalk> buster: There are neighbourhoods of either origin that are homeomorphic to R.
[06:27:18] <PlanckWalk> Not *all* neighbourhoods are, but that's not required.

[06:28:56] <buster> Got it. Thanks.
[06:29:35] <Z-module> these non-hausdorff spaces are very pathological: You can have two compact subsets that have non-compact intersection.
[06:29:54] <Z-module> (that can't happen in a hausdorff space)
[06:31:25] <PlanckWalk> buster: In your "suppose not" section, I'm not sure what you mean by f(p2).  Is that supposed to be f'(p2)?
[06:31:59] <buster> Ouch ...
[06:32:16] <PlanckWalk> I'm also not convinced that there exists a suitable f' that agrees on all of M intersect N
[06:32:56] <buster> Well, not that I need to try to fix it now that I know it can't work

[08:00:50] <laurus> The way I see it is, we try to define a function f in X'' that takes l in X' to K. We _can_ select the standard dual basis, l_1, ..., l_n, so that f(l) = f(b_1 l_1 + ... + b_n l_n) = b_1 f(l_1) + ... + b_n f(l_n) since f is linear. Presumably selecting numbers for f(l_1), ..., f(l_n) "defines" f. But why must these numbers be related to a particular x in X?

[08:16:59] <am1985> laurus, thanks, yeah I think I'm at that level of easily forgetting stuff :)
[08:17:27] <johnkeats6> laurus, but the idea is just to show that the map X --> X'' given by "x -> (the thing that evaluates a given l at x)" is linear and injective
[08:17:41] <johnkeats6> since X and X'' have the same (finite) dimension, it must be surjective by linear algebra magic
[08:19:30] <laurus> johnkeats6: So, for a given f in X'', f _is_ defined as f(l) = l(x)? Or can be defined that way

I got into this part because I'm trying to understand later how you define the matrix of the transpose. What I am confused here is, the lecturer seems to make a big deal about how T'l is different from l circ T, but I am not sure why that is a big deal.
[08:26:43] <laurus> I mean, he says lT is l circ T, but T'l is T'(l), but that seems like no difference to me
[08:28:06] <johnkeats6> it wouldn't make sense to compose T' . l
[08:28:11] <johnkeats6> the domains don't line up.

[18:19:32] <rubiksdream> yeah, and stopping times are needed to formulate e.g. strong markov property
[18:19:39] <schillingklaus> time-discrete ones are often called chains
[18:19:42] <rubiksdream> but i think all of this is doable with a solid foundation in measure teory

[18:21:37] <Franciman> to determine how much you still have to live
[18:21:45] <Franciman> (so our life is not a markov process :D)
[18:21:58] <schillingklaus> for example radioactive decay. It does not matter how old the nuclei or particles are, the probability for any of them to decompose in a specified interval is always the same. Ths is, the past is not remembered
[18:22:33] <rubiksdream> I should add, its not really 'determined', what I mean is that the best (L^2) approximation of the next state given the history is the same as the best (L^2) approximation of the next state given the previous (in continuous time, 'present') state
[18:22:48] <rubiksdream> this is the formal statement of the markov property
[18:22:59] <rubiksdream> and by best (L^2) approximation I mean conditional expectation
[18:23:18] <rubiksdream> so from that standpoint you can ignore the whole history
[18:23:30] <dila> you can augment states to get a markov process that considers more than the previous state
[18:23:40] <rubiksdream> it would not be markov then.
[18:23:44] <dila> in a way that the markov property still holds
[18:24:01] <rubiksdream> if there is dependency on states more than the last one, it is not markov
[18:24:16] <dila> i can't be bothered to explain
[18:24:31] <rubiksdream> you're probably thinking of tupling a markov process
[18:24:37] <rubiksdream> e.g. (x_n,x_{n-1})
[18:24:39] <dila> that sounds like it, yes
[18:24:41] <em> schillingklaus: just in the sense that it's valuable but 'all real analysis' is all the same.
[18:24:55] <rubiksdream> yeah, that is still markov, but its only because you've changed the state space
[18:24:59] <rubiksdream> it still only depends on the previous state

[19:32:03] <rubiksdream> so in a way, what you're curious about are weird subrings of direct sums of fields
[19:33:56] <rubiksdream> okay this is kinda fun, and this comes down to studying linear transformations F^k -> F^k whose minimal poly = char poly
[19:34:28] <rubiksdream> so you're interested in matrices over some field, whose minimal poly = char poly, well to be precise the F-module associated to the linear transformation associated to these matrices

[19:36:21] <dila> but i understand what you said about the direct sum
[19:36:35] <rubiksdream> well it turns out that what you are interested in is quite related to modules
[19:36:55] <rubiksdream> as in there is a nice description in terms of K[T]-modules
[19:36:56] <dila> my real frustration is that all of this assumes a procedure to obtain the i_j's

[21:43:35] <tusko> How many 6-letter words can be formed from the letters 'W', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'L', 'E'?
[21:43:56] <rubiksdream> Z-module whoops. I should add C needs to be convexc
[21:44:00] <loopspace> em: you might consider https://www.amazon.com/Lebesgues-Integration-Mathematical-Association-Textbooks/dp/0521711835  or https://www.amazon.com/Real-Numbers-Introduction-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/3319015761 as historically informed/big picture supplements in your study of real analysis
[21:44:13] <rubiksdream> Z-module that makes it a lot harder (non convex the answer is affirmative for sure)
[21:44:15] <tempate> tusko: I'm going to say 6! / 2!, so... 360?
[21:44:25] <tusko> I feel like this answer should be 6! since there are 6 choices * 5 choices * 4 choices * ... * 1 choice
[21:44:26] <em> loopspace: thanks very much.
[21:44:34] <tusko> But, yes, the answer is 6!/2!
[21:44:44] <tusko> I just don't understand why
[21:44:48] <tempate> tusko: you need to account for 'F' being repeated
[21:45:04] <rubiksdream> oh wow, when you add in convex, i am pretty sure the answer is it cannot be countable
[21:45:06] <tusko> that's weak
[21:45:13] <tusko> so they're exclusing 1 F?
[21:45:21] <rubiksdream> i have a sort of proof
[21:45:22] <tempate> tusko: so W A F_1 F_2 L E is a different word to W A F_2 F_1 L E if you're using 6!
[21:45:40] <tusko> I see, so I double counted
[21:45:45] <tempate> right
[21:45:51] <tusko> lame
[21:46:00] <rubiksdream> oh crap, i phrased the problem wrong.. sorry Z-module
[21:46:14] <rubiksdream> i meant can there only be countably line segments starting at c contained in C
[21:47:55] <Z-module> don't think so: we're in R^n with n > 1.  So C can't be all a subset of some single line (it would then have empty interior in R^n). So pick x, y, z in C, all distinct, not all on one line. Then isn't the entire triangular region with vertices x, y, z inside C ?
[21:48:59] <rubiksdream> yes!
[21:49:14] <rubiksdream> absolutely, the convex hull will be a subset
[21:49:19] <Z-module> yeah
[21:49:30] <Z-module> in math here, we're all about agriculture and shipping
[21:49:46] <Z-module> (kernels, sheaves, germs, hulls, ...)
[21:49:52] <rubiksdream> haha
[21:50:13] <Z-module> hmm, no "jibs" yet
[21:50:14] <rubiksdream> okay sweet
[21:50:17] <rubiksdream> so what you said is right
[21:50:24] <rubiksdream> if its convex with nonempty interior, it will work
[21:50:33] <rubiksdream> thats a significant generalization i think
[21:51:27] <em> loopspace: that same author also wrote this book which I had previously heard of and I wonder if it would be good: https://www.amazon.com/Approach-Analysis-Mathematical-Association-Textbooks/dp/0883857472/ref=pd_bxgy_img_1/131-9553426-7700921?pd_rd_w=3pRrh&pf_rd_p=fd3ebcd0-c1a2-44cf-aba2-bbf4810b3732&pf_rd_r=1BJSNMBS8YE2EYTTF45V&pd_rd_r=2183db00-deea-4777-a7df-e1d2352341ba&pd_rd_wg=N3xdo&pd_rd_i=0883857472&psc=1
[21:52:00] <Z-module> in any case, there are weird "edge cases" of convex sets, like the open unit disk on R^2 with all rational points of the unit circle adjoined.
[21:52:41] <rubiksdream> right, i guess fortunately that doesn't throw too much of a fork into the generalization
[21:52:45] <rubiksdream> since its almost star shaped
[21:52:50] <Z-module> yeah
[21:52:58] <Z-module> I think it *is* star-shaped
[21:53:04] <rubiksdream> yeah
[21:53:05] <Z-module> relative to any interior point
[21:53:41] <loopspace> em: there are good things in that (prequel) book, too. Depends on whether it would be too much review to hold your interest. Gives a little more background on Fourier series to help appreciate the second book. Also, most things written by the other author that I linked (Stillwell) are well worth reading (with supplements)
