[13:50:49] <xeno> anyone got a good idea on how to make an actual installable/runnable F# application for macOS? 
[14:33:46] <MatthiasVance> xeno: Do you know how to do it for any other .NET application? :D
[14:33:59] <xeno> no
[14:34:12] <MatthiasVance> xeno: I'd look at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/platform/fsharp/
[14:34:18] <xeno> F# is the only .Net language I know
[14:34:19] <MatthiasVance> And other related projects
[14:35:39] <xeno> tried to look around there, and tried to google too, but all I manage to find is a trillion explanations on how to install .Net itself 
[14:38:30] <MatthiasVance> xeno: With Xamarin you can build a cross-platform UI application that you for example could upload to the App Store
[14:45:19] <xeno> I know - but I want a command line application that I could ideally distribute through homebrew (or as an rpm on redhat or something)

[15:19:48] <MatthiasVance> xeno: I'm sure there are other packaging options, after all it's just a macOS application when you're done
[15:20:14] <xeno> well, it's a macOS application with a VM 
[15:20:25] <xeno> it's a similar issue with java, it's mot trivial to package that either
