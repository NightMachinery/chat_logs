[00:42:19] <qergle> cuppajoeman: what is your argument that the box topology is connected?
[00:45:12] <cuppajoeman> So for R2 if you take any open subset of R^2 with the box topology, then it looks like U x V where U and V are open in R^2, if you were able to make a separation then you would have another X x Y open in R^2 such that they are disjoint and their union is R2. If that's the case then we have (U x V) Union (X x Y) = ( U Union X ) x (V Union Y) = R^2, but that U Union X = R, which is a cont. since R is connected.

[01:49:19] <greenbagels> cuppajoeman: what is your question again?
[01:50:36] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: correct, box and product topology only differ on infinite products.
[01:52:38] <somiaj> Note, not all open sets in R^2 in the box topology are of the form UxV where U and V are open subsets of R, mostly because most subsets of R^2 are not of the form UxV
[01:53:30] <somiaj> the 'boxes' just form a basis for the toplogy, but a general open set may not be written in the form UxV, think of say an open disc, how do you write a disk of radius r as a product of two intervals (or other open sets)

[04:58:12] <PlanckWalk> It's defined there
[04:58:13] <somiaj> Here they are using R^omega to mean all functions from omega -> R, which is just a sequence from N -> R
[04:58:31] <PlanckWalk> "It follows that the space R^inf that is ..."
[04:58:35] <cuppajoeman> I've been looking but in that proof it's defined as union of those
[04:59:16] <cuppajoeman> R^inf = Union n in N of R~n ?
[04:59:27] <PlanckWalk> There's it's defined as the space of real sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms.

[05:04:30] <cuppajoeman> https://i.imgur.com/i6xnUmX.png "the closure of R^inf equals R^omega so R^omega is connected as well" does anyone see this?
[05:04:47] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[05:04:56] <cuppajoeman> How does it follow?
[05:05:17] <PlanckWalk> Just from the usual definition of closure and connectedness
[05:06:04] <PlanckWalk> (and the fact that the intersection of two closed sets is closed)
[05:06:04] <cuppajoeman> Connected if there is no separation?
[05:07:06] <PlanckWalk> Yes, no partition into clopen sets
[05:08:24] <cuppajoeman> So I see that R^inf is connected
[05:09:00] <cuppajoeman> And if we know that the closure of R^inf is all of R^omega, how are we getting that R^omega is connected?
[05:09:27] <PlanckWalk> Have you already proved that A connected implies cl(A) connected?
[05:10:05] <cuppajoeman> Ah ok
[05:10:12] <cuppajoeman> not yet
[05:10:20] <PlanckWalk> Oh well, it's simple enough.
[05:12:02] <cuppajoeman> So with this theorem we would have R^omega to be connected.

[05:24:15] <cuppajoeman> oh ok

[07:19:31] <W> yeah I _feel_ that is correct reasoning, but I also wanted to avoid being more strong than necessary, as I've been trying to wrap my brain around bounds outside sets earlier today, and my brain keeps interjecting "okay, but is <golden pentagram> larger or smaller than all the elements of the set?" (or any other inventive non-element you prefer)
[07:20:23] <greenbagels> W: i think what you said is equally valid; we're just both assuming 2 out of the 3 conditions and showing it precludes the third
[07:24:02] <W> oh, the notes I had had a different definition of supremum and infimum than what Wikipedia suggests, and the Wikipedia definitions don't allow for any golden pentagrams, guess I might have just caused more work for myself by not checking multiple texts

[12:37:00] <cherim> It's a strange idea to write gs for gsg^{-1}. How do you write the product of g and s then?
[12:38:32] <cadmio> g*x means the action of g on x (g,x) -> g*x and can be abbreviated to gx but it's confusing
[12:39:32] <cherim> Maybe I don't see some unicode / formatting, for me it looks like St_S := {g \in S : gs=s}
[12:40:10] <cadmio> right but gs=s here is gsg^-1
[12:40:44] <cherim> In any case, the definition is your paste, do you still have a question about St_S \supseteq S not related to notation?
[12:41:56] <cadmio> it's not clear to me how this subsetet of G is a superset of S
[12:42:32] <cherim> St_S \supseteq S means any element of S belongs to St_S
[12:43:03] <cadmio> sure
[12:43:12] <cherim> Which, unfolded, means that for any element s of S and any other element g of S, gsg^{-1} is again in S
[12:43:24] <cherim> This is always true whenever S is a subgroup
[12:44:36] <cadmio> St_S = S when S is a normal subgroup of G, right?

[12:47:21] <cherim> This is true
[12:47:47] <cadmio> here S is a subgroup of G, so the requirement is S being normal
[12:47:58] <cadmio> to be equal to the conjugate
[12:48:36] <cherim> The book means that "if H is a normal subgroup, then H^x=H for any x in G"

[13:06:36] <cherim> tangent is a periodic function (with period pi). It's defined on all R except the points where cos(x)=0
[13:06:58] <Guest23> Oh i mean, to define it as a bijection since i am also considering the inverse of tan
[13:07:04] <cherim> [-pi/2, pi/2] is useful since tan(x) takes each real value once on that interval

[14:05:53] <Guest23> cherim it was a bit tricky but i solved my question, it had to do with the sign of sec(x) after the integral was solved
[14:06:03] <Guest23> (changing the definition of tan)
[14:06:47] <cherim> I am sure there was in fact no problem from the start, more so about "tricky"

[14:11:33] <Guest23> Indefinite
[14:11:39] <Guest23> Its defined at the top
[14:12:02] <cherim> Then you have to express in through x, not theta
[14:12:17] <cherim> You get sec(\theta), not sec(x)
[14:12:36] <Guest23> Right, sorry, that are all typos
[14:12:47] <cherim> At this second variable change all auxiliary signs will go away
[14:13:02] <Guest23> Yeah, i noticed that, that was tricky for me
[14:14:12] <Guest23> The sign goes away because sec(theta) is - sqrt(a^2+x)/a with tan defined in [pi/2,3*pi/2]
[14:14:27] <Guest23> and its positive when tan is defined in  [-pi/2, pi/2]

[16:54:13] <johnkeats6> you can interpret a function g as the functional f |-> integral f(x) g(x) dx
[16:54:41] <johnkeats6> this is why people write things like integral f(x) delta(x) dx even though delta is really a distribution

[19:00:47] <isekaijin> This is probably fretting over nothing, but sometimes I have wanted to use mathematical induction in the following form. Let P(n) and Q(n) be predicates on the natural numbers such that Q(0) holds, [forall n : P(n) -> Q(n)] holds, and [forall n : Q(n) -> P(n+1)] holds. Then P(n) holds for all positive n.
[19:02:38] <isekaijin> Written in such abstract terms, it might seem like getting rid of one of P or Q is the easiest solution (to get an induction in standard form), but this might be awkward when we replace P and Q with statements that actually arise in mathematical practice.

[21:02:37] <andi_> uff. greenbagels please don't murder me but is this valid? |sigma^(n+1)| = |sigma|^(n+1) = |sigma^n| * |sigma| now i use the step information that |sigma^n| = |sigma|^n and replace it so i have |sigma|^n * |sigma|
[21:03:10] <andi_> full equation would be |sigma^(n+1)| = |sigma^n| * |sigma|
[21:03:26] <rex_victor> andi_: your first equals sign is using what you're trying to proof
[21:03:42] <greenbagels> andi_: you really want to start with what you know, which is the statement using n, not n+1
[21:04:01] <greenbagels> you *could* do it the other way around if you also know every step is "reversible" in some way
[21:04:15] <andi_> but then i'm clueless sorry :/
[21:04:18] <greenbagels> because you don't want to get in the habit of saying like "1 = 0, multiply both sides by 0, now 0=0, which is true"
[21:04:58] <andi_> so i start with |sigma^n| = |sigma|^n - okay, but what should i do to get a n+1 now?
[21:05:04] <rex_victor> andi_: you can start with |Σ|^(n + 1) = |Σ|^n |Σ| = |Σ^n| |Σ|
[21:06:25] <andi_> rex_victor: but what can you do now?
[21:06:28] <greenbagels> andi_: a train of thought you could have is "ok well i have powers of n on both sides; to get to n+1 on one side, i can multiply both sides by |sigma|"
[21:06:36] <greenbagels> and then you get what rex_victor said
[21:06:41] <andi_> ah
[21:06:49] <greenbagels> the next step is to try to show that |sigma^n||sigma| = |sigma^(n+1)|
[21:07:17] <rex_victor> possibly by defining a suitable bijection

[22:57:20] <qergle> cuppajoeman: because they want it so that B doesn't affect your A

[22:58:15] <qergle> A,B are indep if knowing B's status (happened or not) doesn't affect A's probability.
[22:58:22] <qergle> iow P(A|B)=P(A)
[22:58:25] <cuppajoeman> yes
[22:58:31] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[22:58:34] <qergle> ok. now, conditionally, what does that mean?
[22:58:44] <qergle> well, conditioned on C, we don't want B affecting A
[22:58:46] <cuppajoeman> Isn't that conditionally?
[22:58:50] <cuppajoeman> Oh
[22:58:59] <cuppajoeman> Ok
[22:59:15] <qergle> so P(A|C)=P(A|B∩C)
[22:59:24] <cuppajoeman> Right...
[22:59:32] <cuppajoeman> Knowing B doesn't chang anything
[22:59:35] <qergle> on other words, conditioned on C, knowing B doesn't affect A

[22:59:55] <cuppajoeman> And P(B | C) = P(B | A & C)
[23:00:26] <cuppajoeman> Then what about P(A & B | C)?>
[23:00:28] <qergle> you can turn P(A|C)=P(A|B∩C) into P(A∩B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C)
[23:01:02] <cuppajoeman> How?

[23:07:31] <qergle> what am i looking at?
[23:07:50] <cuppajoeman> my attempt
[23:07:59] <qergle> ok good
[23:08:09] <qergle> multiplby both sides by P(B∩C)
[23:08:19] <qergle> then divide both sides by P(C)
[23:08:22] <qergle> voila
[23:09:07] <cuppajoeman> Ahh
[23:09:23] <cuppajoeman> So your trying to modify LHS to become P (A & B | C)
[23:09:33] <qergle> not trying anything
[23:10:01] <qergle> i am showing why the original thing you gave as defn is justified as equivalent to what we want: B not affecting A after conditioning on C.
[23:10:14] <qergle> you asked "why did they define this way?"
[23:10:20] <qergle> i answer that
[23:10:22] <cuppajoeman> Yes, you motivated it

[23:17:51] <qergle> cuppajoeman: better way is what i say first
[23:17:59] <cuppajoeman> ?
[23:18:11] <qergle> conditioning on C means restrict universe from initial sample space S to C. C becomes new sample space
[23:18:35] <qergle> and in this new sample space C we want P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B)
[23:18:53] <qergle> so P(A∩B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C) is our condition

[23:23:12] <qergle> it's no different really. maybe first one you call unconditional is conditional too and you don't know. sample space S might already be restricted.

[23:36:26] <cuppajoeman> Is dividing how we restrict?
