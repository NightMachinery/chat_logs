Now I need to a) get rid of the sudo -S crutch to run the stuff with elevated privileges, and b) somehow make it wait for the drive to connect if the job is executed, but I did not connect + mount the drive.

[14:00:49] <knstn> Guys, I have a ubuntu laptop (20.04 LTS) fully updated. I create a hotspot with my smartphone. The smartphone is using 4G cellular data. I connect the laptop to the hotspot. I see the connection active but it says "Connectivity: limited". The link is UP but the mode is DORMANT. I can ping 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 but I can't connect to the internet at all.
[14:01:01] <knstn> I disabled UFW as well but with no luck.

[19:05:15] <Magio> Hi, I've just installed 21.10, and noticed that you can't launch scripts by double clicking them from Nautilus in this version of GNOME. I looked into it a bit, and it seems that's intended as GNOME devs decided to remove that option (check this bug report https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus/-/issues/1700 for more info). You can still launch
[19:05:16] <Magio> scripts by right clicking and selecting that option, but as it's something I do quite often I'd prefer just being able to double click. I was wondering if anyone here had any idea how I could regain that functionality?

[22:10:35] <webchat3> I upgraded from 21.04 to 21.10 yesterday, and I am seeing some odd behavior with Firefox.
[22:10:41] <webchat3> First is that when using the Firefox Snap, I am unable to use the auto-type feature of KeepassXC. Entering the global shortcut (ie ctrl+alt+shift+p) does nothing in the Firefox window. Opening KeepassXC, selecting an entry, and selecting `Perform Auto-Type` does not send the credentials to Firefox.
[22:10:47] <webchat3> I can use the auto-type from KeepassXC in the Chromium Snap just fine, as well as in the Flatpak version of Firefox.
[22:10:48] *** Quits: sam3 (~sam@42.105.129.202) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:11:04] <webchat3> I have tried both the Snap and Flatpak versions of KeepassXC, both have the same behavior.
[22:11:11] <webchat3> Second issue is that whenever I open the Firefox Flatpak while any other window is present, Firefox opens *underneath* the currently focused window and I get a notification that `Firefox is ready`. For example, open the file explorer, then open the FF flatpak.
[22:11:15] <webchat3> The Snap version opens as expected (ie on top of everything else)
[22:11:20] <webchat3> Any ideas on what's going on here?
