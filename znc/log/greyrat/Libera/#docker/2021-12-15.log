[00:56:05] <rawtaz> haha
[00:56:26] <BtbN> The Kernel does not tend to lie about the address already being in use, soo
[00:56:35] <Zta> It starts without -p 80:80
[00:56:38] <rawtaz> Zta: also, if you change the  -p 80:80  to  -p 88:88  does that change anything?

[00:57:39] <Zta> I have an old, working system running. I compared the output of docker inspect www.  And the broken system is missing vital pieces in its Networks section.  Gateway and IPAddress being among them.

[00:58:24] <BtbN> Like I said, the Kernel does not tend to lie about claiming the address being in use
[00:58:29] <BtbN> So something is listening there
[00:58:34] <rawtaz> Zta: FWIW, if it does start fine when you use  -p 88:80  you can also try connecting to the web service on your host's port 88 and see if you arrive at the web server in the container?

[01:00:08] <Zta> Oh, it gives a high port number.  Could this be permissions?
[01:00:16] <rawtaz> Zta: okay, then you should probably focus on the host having ports in use, just like BtbN says
[01:00:16] <BtbN> Is dockerd not running as root?
[01:00:34] <BtbN> Though the error you get when trying to bind to priv ports as non-root is different

[01:09:51] <Zta> 0.0.0.0 works too.
[01:10:21] <Zta> Sorry, no daemon.json in this primitive setup =\
[01:11:04] <Zta> I'm currently testing in qemu, but I can confirm that I can reach the webserver.
[01:11:12] <Zta> This is good news, thanks!
[01:11:41] <Zta> I would just like to make it work again without explicitly defining the binding address.  I wonder where that got lost.
[01:12:29] <rawtaz> Zta: what was the port you used with -p when it did work earlier?
[01:12:56] <Zta> -p 80:80 
[01:13:56] <Zta> Btw, it not only web and 80.  It's all port forwarding in general.  I tried with a mqtt server and a few other things.
[01:14:05] <tabakhase> Zta well create it, or set it as launchoption or whatever your OS wants - its just "--ip"
[01:14:27] <rawtaz> Zta: uhm 80:80 is what didnt work, no? you tried some other high port earlier that worked
[01:16:02] <Zta> rawtaz: 8080:80 failed. But random port worked.
[01:16:44] <Zta> tabakhase: --ip passed to dockerd?
[01:16:54] <tabakhase> yep
[01:17:30] <tabakhase> its prob just choking on defaulting to :: for ipv6, hardcode to 0.0.0.0 on ipv4 and should all be gucci
[01:17:43] <rawtaz> Zta: yes, and i am asking you which random port you used? or did you just make it  -p 80  ?
[01:17:53] <rawtaz> actually i still wonder which port worked :)
[01:18:27] <rawtaz> +1 to what tabakhase said, it's the proper workaround unless you can figure out the ipv6 issues
[01:18:58] <Zta> rawtaz: I just passed -p 80.  0.0.0.0:49154->80/tcp
[01:19:18] <rawtaz> ok cheers
[01:19:25] <Zta> It looks like binds to 0.0.0.0
[01:19:43] <Zta> You think it's an ipv6 issue?  I tried to disable all ipv6.
[01:19:57] <rawtaz> i wonder if it tries to bind to ipv4 only when you just give it  -p 80  and tries to bind to :: when you give it  -p 80:80
[01:20:24] <Zta> Oh, wait... I only gave you half the truth if that port binding; there everything:  0.0.0.0:49154->80/tcp, :::49155->80/tcp
[01:20:35] <rawtaz> well it seems like it, i mean when you force it to use ipv4 things work, so yeah
[01:20:53] <rawtaz> hmm ok. that isnt in line with ipv6 being a problem
[01:21:28] <Zta> It does bind to ipv6 though.  When only given -p 80 and resorting to a random port.
[01:22:56] <Zta> I see dockerd has --ipv6, but not a --no-ipv6.  Can I prevent it from using ipv6 at all?
[01:23:47] <tabakhase> just slap the --ip in...
[01:24:03] <Zta> dockerd --help says --ip defaults to 0.0.0.0 already.  But I can try anyway.

[01:28:56] <Zta> Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp [::]:80: bind: address already in use. Could it be that since I've disabled ipv6 on my system, that docker first binds to ipv4 and then, because ipv6 is disabled, it somehow barfs and tries to fallback to ipv4:80 - which is already in use?
[01:29:14] <tabakhase> Zta well thats shitty... if docker just translates --ip BACK to "what it thiks you may want" rather than "what you gave it" is bit of a ripperonis...
[01:29:53] <rawtaz> definitely worth enabling ipv6 again to see if the problem goes away - again isolating stuff easily

[01:31:11] <rawtaz> your docker is called lightwhale, fancy that
[01:31:22] <Zta> Right. I approach would be to disable ipv6 in docker.
[01:31:23] <Zta> Thanks.
[01:31:45] <Zta> It's my lightweight docker OS.  Which currently doesn't work =\
[01:33:06] <rawtaz> you could set  {"debug": true}  in the docekr daemon config file, but i dont know if this will help. but why not
[01:33:12] <Zta> tabakhase: Spooky how? In that it's a too open default?
[01:33:21] <tabakhase> yea
[01:33:38] <rawtaz> and log-level to debug
[01:33:50] <programmerq> it's pretty typical for an inet6 any address listen in linux to listen on all ipv4 and ipv6 interfaces.
[01:33:57] <tabakhase> "secure defaults" and all that ;-)
[01:34:12] <Zta> Gotcha
[01:34:37] <programmerq> It's not a hard and fast rule-- in fact the port publish in swarm mode will use an inet listen instead of an inet6 listen.
[01:34:52] <rawtaz> in case anyone who recently joined wants to see the error messages we're discussing, see https://pastebin.com/MqYssST5
[01:35:39] <programmerq> I take advantage of the inet6 listen with a regular port publish so I can have an ipv6 service that's running in a "regular" docker container without doing anything fancy-- I just publish to all interfaces and that's what it does-- all ipv4 and ipv6 interfaces.
[01:36:37] <programmerq> so if ipv6 is disabled at the os level, I wonder if that's what is prompting the message. hmmm
[01:36:40] <programmerq> now I'm curious
[01:36:51] <Zta> Exactly.
[01:36:59] <rawtaz> :3
[01:37:00] <tabakhase> programmerq to fill you in, core issue seems to be that "even dockerd --ip 0.0.0.0 attempts to use [::]:80 when given a '-p 80:80'" - but a explicit '-p 0.0.0.0:80:80' works just fine
[01:37:29] <programmerq> yeah, that's interesting.
[01:37:51] <programmerq> https://stackoverflow.com/a/68332078/4930423 - this SO answer is consistent with that behavior.
[01:38:25] <programmerq> I'm curious if doing ip 0.0.0.0 in daemon.json instead of in dockerd --ip 0.0.0.0 might have any effect
[01:38:25] <Zta> Last known working docker version is 19.03.13.  Now it's broken on 20.10.9.  But!  It may be a mix of other things.  Like I said, this is a bastard system I'm on. 
[01:38:25] <rawtaz> also passing just  -p 80  works as well, it yields these port listenings:  0.0.0.0:49154->80/tcp, :::49155->80/tcp
[01:38:57] <programmerq> I do remember they introduced a regression where it would do ipv4 *only*, and then they released a fix since it impacted several folks
[01:39:14] <rawtaz> Zta: how can it listen on that :::49155 though if oyu ahve disabled ipv6? xD
[01:39:16] <programmerq> but it should also be able to detect that ipv6 is disabled and fall back to using the 0.0.0.0 ipv4 any addr

[01:40:00] <tabakhase> rawtaz that '-p 80' actually works might be ratehr simple to explain that in that case it actually "scans what is free" and just skips the whole v6 then - so i wouldnt draw to much from that
[01:40:01] <Zta> programmerq: Maybe it did.  And since ipv4 port 80 was taken it fails.
[01:40:40] <rawtaz> tabakhase: hmm but it shows it listens on ipv6

[02:35:00] <Zta> Maybe that registry is hardcoded and looks up ipv6 first.
[02:38:25] <rawtaz> not sure i follow. something is asking for the IP for registry-1.docker.io - which DNS servers are used for that should be configured in your system (unless it's hardcoded or similar into docker, or docker has some setting somewhere telling it to use that ipv6 dns server)
[02:38:39] <rawtaz> perhaps check that you dont have a localhost one somewhere?

[04:14:34] <Square> to me dockers way of requiring a full damn OS install be written to disc for every build seems just too bloaty. Isnt there interest in making docker more light weight? 
[04:14:37] <Square> literal "waste of energy" comes to mind
[04:16:15] <cim> Square: what?
[04:16:41] <Square> well, arent you creating an image for every build? 
[04:16:44] <cim> docker does not add a "full OS" during build
[04:17:17] *** Quits: Tach (~Tach@user/tach) (Quit: Tach)
[04:17:17] <Square> but the images are like 700mb for just a simple webapp. Arent they?
[04:17:38] <cim> that's because people don't uninstall the dependencies after
[04:19:31] <Square> cim, could you examplify? What dependencies should they uninstall?
[04:19:48] <jacekowski> and use full os base image rather than alpine or something
[04:21:41] <cim> for example you're compiling something in cpp, you'll need build tools, lots of lib-packages-dev, etc. after compiling, you normally uninstall the bloatwares. or they don't use multi stage builds
[04:22:33] <cim> alpine linux is great as the host OS too
[04:22:58] <Square> gotcha
[04:23:03] <jacekowski> but to be honest, the longer i use docker the more annoyed i'm with it
[04:23:22] <cim> docker is a culture, a way of life
[04:24:02] <jacekowski> why is there no easy way to change any options
[04:24:08] <Square> Whats your view on NixOs? With their on the fly containerized environements?

[04:24:22] <bencc1> how can I check if I have a file descriptors limit issue?
[04:24:32] <tabakhase> Square one point is also that of those 700MB, the 550MB baselayer are shared across 15 different images that you used to create 124 different containers - all whikle using 550mb ONCE
[04:24:35] <bencc1> can it be global limit and not just per container limit?
[04:24:45] <cim> never used nixOS
[04:24:59] <jacekowski> like i have a network with 100 containers in it and i need to change host interface its' using, i have to delete all containers (or disconnect them from the network) delete the network, recreate network with new options
[04:25:28] <jacekowski> tabakhase: they are not shared because each container uses slightly different version
[04:27:00] <tabakhase> jacekowski well thats up to you, may orgs have shared baseimages with there own release cycles (cause this also keep docker pull&bush blazing fast) - and when, let it be 4x550 MB - still a lot less than 124 VMs with there own filesystems ;-)
[04:27:05] <tabakhase> *many
[04:27:56] <cim> i'm happy that i don't have to touch anything else once it's setup

[07:12:07] <programmerq> possible? yes. guaranteed? no.
[07:12:29] <programmerq> your individual workloads that are storing data on the volumes may have issues of their own due to out-of-space.
[07:13:40] <programmerq> I've seen disk full happen to many many dockerd instances, and it *can* introduce issues for docker, but it isn't a guarantee. you might have a container's write layer that has some corruption. The immutable image layers are most likely fine. In the worst case, you may have some corruption that prevents dockerd from starting altogether. It's a fairly rare event in my experience.

[18:42:49] <lmat> Sometimes it will say "container xyz unhealthy" and quit, again, no logging output. I run docker container logs xyz; and see the logs, but it would be REALLY nice not to have to wait for the health check to time out to get a clue what the problem is.

[21:21:38] <rawtaz> you WORKDIR your ass into /gluon, then copy the app and scripts foldres into ./ which resolves to where you are, which is /gluon. so you end up with /gluon/app and /gluon/scripts , no?

[23:20:46] <ash_worksi> what do you think of --squash?
[23:23:47] <rawtaz> nothing
[23:23:51] <rawtaz> it means nothing to me
[23:23:56] <rawtaz> :|
[23:25:41] <ash_worksi> I see
[23:26:02] <ash_worksi> well, that's one opinion... does anyone else have any opinions?
[23:26:25] <ash_worksi> or if you'd care to elaborate rawtaz :P
[23:28:47] <rawtaz> no i just.. havent used it :)
[23:28:54] <rawtaz> but like, why do you ask?
[23:29:14] <rawtaz> there's pros and cons to it, like everything else in this world
[23:29:24] <rawtaz> if you need to do what it does, use it, otherwise dont
[23:29:40] <rawtaz> you wont have reusable layers if you squash them, obviously

[23:34:46] <tabakhase> and a lot of the old "cases where it could make sense to use" can just be multistage builds these days

[23:46:21] <theseb> I don't know much but it seems to me that Docker and Kubernetes are the fundamental way to do software now....just like HTML/web took over the world it seems Docker + Kubernetes is taking over software...so we must all learn them cold yes?
[23:47:11] <rawtaz> nah
[23:47:34] <rawtaz> but having some experience with containers is really good

[23:50:58] <rawtaz> i dont think so
