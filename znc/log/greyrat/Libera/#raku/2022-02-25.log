[00:00:59] <MasterDuke> why do you need to reinstall everything?
[00:02:54] <[Coke]> because going between versions, I've had the install dir get screwed up, since there is no uninstall, only "install on top"
[00:03:20] <[Coke]> so having dealt with that once... never again. it's probably ignorable if you're just installing a release every few months.
[00:03:29] <[Coke]> (and would never happen with rakubrew)

[00:03:54] <MasterDuke> i can see that for rakudu, but i thought modules haven't needed to be reinstalled for a long time
[00:04:20] <[Coke]> ... to be fair, I have been around for a bit.
[00:04:42] <MasterDuke> but i know windows support in general isn't quite as good. might be nice to file an issue if you can repro something not behaving correctly
[00:05:19] <[Coke]> ... I'm usually trying to fix *other* things, so don't want to accidentally shave a yak while doing so, that's all

[00:11:14] <MasterDuke> speaking of windows, is anyone here familiar with jom? i was trying to use it instead of nmake on windows, but it won't build a clean checkout of moarvm, complaining about not being able to find one of the 3rdparty dependency .objs

[21:39:38] <p6steve> The applicant must be a contributor to the Raku language specification or one of its implementations.
[21:39:41] <p6steve> The application must be endorsed by one or more people in Raku Steering Council.
[21:39:51] <p6steve> .or
[21:41:16] <lizmat> a. having several prominent Raku modules out there *and* blogging about it, makes you a contributor (whether you like that or not :-)
[21:41:25] <lizmat> b. You are hereby endorsed by me
[21:42:04] <Voldenet> I don't know how helpful it will be, but Inline::Python is mostly pyhelper.c and thin wrapper over it, the whole thing is under 1k LOC
[21:42:21] <p6steve> anyway - either way I need to work out if I have the skills as I get closer to the metal ... so I will dig in and try and fix (probably needing some help) and PR back if I get on OK
[21:42:53] <codesections> "You are hereby endorsed by me" me to!  (though feel free to email rsc@raku.org if you want something other than an IRC log :) ) 
[21:43:22] <p6steve> only then will I be able to judge the sensibleness of adoption
[21:43:28] <codesections> also, I agree that "core contributor" is/should be very broad there, and would cover you 
[21:43:55] <p6steve> oh - excellent - thanks!
[21:43:58] <p6steve> both

[22:08:59] <tonyo> i should write a grant for doing a module test grid/harness for different oses+rakudo versions

[22:12:46] <nine> p6steve: in short, Inline::Python hasn't seen development in probably 5 years, except for a few hours to port it to Python 3.
[22:14:07] <nine> p6steve: what it needs is someone looking at Inline::Perl5 and porting that to Inline::Python. Most importantly the way it creates wrapper classes for Perl packages which are a huge part of making integration seamless and for giving decent performance.
[22:14:45] <p6steve> @nine yes, I remember seeing that comment too in the past
[22:14:57] <nine> Inline::Perl5 probably looks quite large in comparison, but that's because for performance reasons there's a lot of duplicated code (e.g. a generic way to call methods and then special ways for methods with 0, 1 and 2 arguments)
[22:18:55] <p6steve> hmmm - 8.8k vs. 2.1k ;-)
[22:19:34] <p6steve> (using githib gloc to count total lines)
[22:21:20] <p6steve> @nine - I think the best start anyway is for me to fix my problem and PR it on the current base since i would need to learn how the current one works before i woul dbe able to consider a porting effort
