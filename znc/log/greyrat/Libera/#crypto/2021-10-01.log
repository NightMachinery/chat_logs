[23:32:20] <Hash> Where does the 'key' in AES encryption come from?
[23:32:30] <ms7821> wherever you like :)
[23:33:20] <Hash> Hey 
[23:33:22] <Hash> Hi
[23:33:25] <Hash> So I'm confused about something
[23:33:41] <Hash> The key legnth is max 256 bits
[23:33:51] <Hash> But RSA produces a really long private key
[23:34:02] <ericonr> those are different keys
[23:34:10] <Hash> So when you try to use your private key, to use AES to encrypt stuff, where does the AES key come from
[23:34:42] <ericonr> from a random number generator, usually, or via diffie-hellman (which also uses a random number generator)
[23:34:52] <Hash> RSA is used to get your key pair. Then you use AES256bit to encrypt the data, but use private key fromRSA as AES key?
[23:34:53] <yawkat> why would you use your RSA private key for AES
[23:34:56] <ericonr> you use RSA to encrypt the symmetric key
[23:34:57] <ioxzev1z> Hash, the key used in aes is not the same as a "really long private key" with RSA
[23:35:33] <ms7821> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_key
[23:36:00] <Hash> So I am trying to figure out how AES gets a key to encrypt things with
[23:36:08] <ioxzev1z> c = AES(m, k), where k (128, 192, 256 bits), ke RSApub(k), send m and ke to recipient
[23:36:18] <ioxzev1z> *ke = 
[23:36:36] <yawkat> Hash: what is the context here?
[23:36:37] <ioxzev1z> uh, c and ke
[23:36:45] <Hash> How AES and RSA work together
[23:36:56] <yawkat> they dont unless you have a protocol that uses both
[23:37:02] <yawkat> which protocol do you have?
[23:37:10] <Hash> No protocol
[23:37:16] <yawkat> then they are unrelated
[23:37:20] <Hash> Just trying to get things sorted in my mind conceptually
[23:37:23] <Hash> Hang on
[23:37:28] <snappy> I think what you're looking for is "hybrid encryption"
[23:37:29] <riv> suppose me and you want to communicate Hash 
[23:37:39] <riv> we both have public/private keys and we know each others public keys
[23:37:48] <snappy> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem
[23:37:52] <Hash> How does that play into AES
[23:38:00] <riv> I generate a random 256 bit key, use your RSA public key to encrypt that to you 
[23:38:02] <Hash> obviously we can' tuse RSA as it's too intensive on cpu/ram
[23:38:05] <riv> now we both have this 256 bit key
[23:38:06] <Hash> So we use AES
[23:38:12] <riv> and we can use it for AES communication now
[23:38:15] <Hash> I see.
[23:38:18] <Hash> hang on
[23:38:19] <Hash> let me read again
[23:38:26] <riv> so this is how we go from asymmetric to symmetric encryption
[23:38:29] <yawkat> youd usually use DH for this nowadays
[23:38:36] <yawkat> not RSA
[23:38:37] <Hash> ok slow down guys
[23:38:55] <riv> you can use any asymmetric, and any symmetric algorithm
[23:39:23] <Hash> Oh I see
[23:39:45] <Hash> Ok thanks for explaining how the pki is linked to AES
[23:39:55] <Hash> Taht's exactly what I was looking for
[23:39:58] <Hash> missing piece fits
[23:41:03] <Hash> The sender then uses that public key and RSA to encrypt and transmit to each recipient their own secret AES key, which can be used to decrypt the data.
[23:41:11] <Hash> https://www.precisely.com/blog/data-security/aes-vs-rsa-encryption-differences I read this too
[23:42:50] <yawkat> great article if it says "The sender then uses that public key and RSA to encrypt and transmit to each recipient their own secret AES key"
[23:43:09] <yawkat> when most things use DH nowadays which doesnt do this
[23:44:03] <Hash> I'm not on DH yet
[23:44:17] <Wulf> yawkat: that article is more than half a year old, so heavily outdated ;-)
[23:44:25] <Hash> It's best to simply just answer the question sometimes and not offer additional information as the student can find it confusing 
[23:45:02] <yawkat> imo RSA is not a good thing to learn first
[23:45:04] <Hash> I personally find that due to ignorance, when I ask a question and lots of additional information is given, I tend to become even more confused.
[23:45:19] <yawkat> using RSA is rarely a good idea
[23:45:53] <Hash> For key exchange?
[23:45:54] <Wulf> RSA is easy to understand, at least when compared to ECC.
[23:46:05] <snappy> ^^
[23:46:08] <Hash> DH is used for key exhange 
[23:46:18] <yawkat> RSA is easy to understand when you dont understand it fully... textbook RSA is insecure
[23:46:43] <snappy> you have to learn textbook RSA to begin with though - at least if you want to get into the theory
[23:46:53] <yawkat> do you though
[23:47:00] <Hash> I am in the introduction to cryptography class at college
[23:47:02] <Wulf> yawkat: padding schemes aren't hard to understand either.
[23:47:03] <Hash> :)
[23:47:26] <yawkat> my crypto course did not do any PK implementation at all. it just gave a definition for KEX and we built on that
[23:47:30] <Hash> It also makes you study for the EC council cert, certified encryption specialist
[23:47:30] <snappy> I think you could start off with RSA-KEM maybe
[23:47:47] <snappy> yawkat: was it a provable security course?
[23:48:04] <Hash> I'm at a fully accredited USA university
[23:48:06] <yawkat> well the course had security proofs.
[23:48:09] <Hash> out of state even
[23:48:18] <yawkat> but the course did not prove P!=NP
[23:48:20] <Hash> I think mine is provable?
[23:48:23] <Hash> what it means?
[23:48:26] <Hash> provable?
[23:48:32] <Hash> i mean in this context guys
[23:48:35] <snappy> I think there's distinct crypto courses, there's provable security crypto, there's math crypto, then there's a in-between crypto course (no proofs)
[23:48:49] <Hash> Oh you mean mathematical proofs
[23:49:01] <Hash> This is intro class, so not heavily math oriented
[23:49:08] <Hash> They want you to know the basics of the math/ciphers though
[23:49:20] <Hash> And recognize and know equations
[23:49:51] <Wulf> There isn't any proof that public key crypto is actually secure.
[23:50:25] <Hash> There are infinite numbers, therefore infinite primes, and infinite key sizes
[23:50:32] <Hash> Shouldn't that help?
[23:50:33] <yawkat> Wulf: i think snappy means constructing cryptosystems with security proofs, assuming the primitives fulfill security assumptions.
[23:51:03] <snappy> ^^ - you worded it much better than i could've
[23:51:06] <yawkat> thats why i said P!=NP wasnt proven in the course, because you obviously cant prove everything :)
[23:51:13] <Wulf> Hash: e.g. for RSA, who says that there's no efficient way to factor large numbers?
[23:51:17] <ericonr> So kinda like proving poly1305 is safe, if the key you use for it is safe as well?
[23:51:46] <yawkat> ericonr: poly1305 is actually information-theoretically secure afaik
[23:51:47] <Hash> Wulf: Dont' they say 2kb key size takes quidrillions of years to crack?
[23:51:54] <Hash> or calculate revers primes factors
[23:51:57] <ericonr> Also, SO told me poly1305 is faster than an actual hash, which explains why one would use that instead of a hash :p
[23:52:04] <Hash> Man
[23:52:14] <Hash> You guys may as well be talking french. I need to go read
[23:52:18] <ericonr> Hash: with known methods, possibly
[23:52:22] <yawkat> ericonr: it's more like saying "TLS is secure assuming ECDH and AES and SHA256 are secure"
[23:52:24] <snappy> Hash: what book do you have?
[23:52:36] <Hash> EC-Council Certified Encryption Specialist(ECES) Version 2
[23:52:50] <snappy> Damn, get a book.
[23:52:53] <Hash> and one more
[23:53:12] <Hash> Welcome to Introduction to Cryptography! This course helps you understand the processes that protect data storage and transmission. Follow the course, provided in the Soomo learning platform, to learn about securing valuable information resources.
[23:53:25] <Hash> online textbook
[23:53:36] <Hash> Welcome to Introduction to Cryptography!
[23:53:49] <Hash> This course supports you developing foundational knowledge and skills in both theoretical and practical encryption and security. You will learn about encryption algorithms, systems, standards, and theory. Your competency is assessed with an objective assessment, and this course provides the content knowledge you need to earn EC-Council’s Certified Encryption Specialist (ECES v2) certification if
[23:53:51] <Hash> you wish to pursue it also
[23:54:03] <ericonr> yawkat: makes sense! I can see a subtle difference between something like TLS where it's a protocol with crypto layers vs an algorithm that uses others algorithms beneath it (if that's what you meant?)
[23:54:17] <ericonr> Still need to learn about information theoretic stuff tho
[23:54:28] <yawkat> ericonr: the proof techniques are similar.
[23:56:30] <snappy> My criticism with provable security techniques is they use models of primitives to do reductionist proofs, but this is divorced from real implementations
[23:56:34] <riv> ericonr: you know OTP is 'secure' but a MITM attacker can just flip any bit!
[23:56:41] <snappy> also see: http://anotherlook.ca/
[23:56:44] <Hash> https://bpa.st/TDSQ
[23:56:54] <Hash> any teachers here?
[23:57:08] <Hash> Here's the cousrse outline
[23:57:23] <Hash> ok yeah you're right
[23:57:29] <Hash> RSA is AFTER DH in the outline
[23:58:11] <yawkat> snappy: padding oracle attacks were a great case for provable security.
[23:58:44] <yawkat> people thought MAC-then-encrypt was fine in practice even though it breaks in security proofs, and look what happened.
[23:58:46] <ericonr> riv: does that make OTP not information-theoretically secure?
[23:58:48] <snappy> Well DH is easier to understand and did come before RSA (unless we talk about GCHQ developing RSA independently in secret)
[23:58:50] <riv> snappy: in Dan Boneh's book we have reduction security proofs for everything based on adversarial games. That gives you margins for key sizes and stuff, I don't think it separates you from real implementations - in fact it allows you to say with confidence what key sizes and so on are needed in real implementations. As well as understanding why it's secure
[23:59:06] <Hash> riv what do you do?
[23:59:28] <riv> ericonr: well it's just that while OTP gives perfect confidentiality, it does not give any integrity at all
