[01:06:18] <edk> well, a prefix of a valid program

[01:07:22] <floatcomplex> SURPRISE_MAX
[01:08:14] <katp32> heyo, odd question but, is there 1) a libc which implements the absolute bare minimum defined by C99 and nothing else, or 2) a way to make glibc (or some other libc) only provide the bare minimum defined by C99 and nothing else. I want a way to enforce C99 compliance in some code, and ensure no features that aren't strictly standard are used
[01:08:26] <vdamewood> for file in *.wav; do flac -8 $file; done # so fun
[01:09:14] <vdamewood> katp32: No, no. and for that there's -pedantic.
[01:09:26] <fizzie> That's not what -pedantic is for, though.
[01:09:55] <vdamewood> Well, technically -pedantic is there so that compiler vendors can say their compiler is strictly conforming.
[01:10:07] <fizzie> "Some users try to use -Wpedantic to check programs for strict ISO C conformance. They soon find that it does not do quite what they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all—only those for which ISO C requires a diagnostic, and some others for which diagnostics have been added. A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in some instances, but would require
[01:10:09] <katp32> yeah, -pedantic applies to compiler features, not libc features, unless I'm mistaken
[01:10:09] <fizzie> considerable additional work and would be quite different from -Wpedantic. We don’t have plans to support such a feature in the near future."

[01:29:26] <floatcomplex> whereas with the same version of gcc in a musl-based cross compiler, it is an error
[01:29:39] <floatcomplex> so -std=c99 -pedantic and the choice of libc are interacting to make it an error

[03:53:10] <fizzie> All floats are signed.
[03:53:16] <dave0> bruda: of course
[03:54:51] <bruda> man floats.h only seems to give me, among other constants, FLT_MAX and FLT_MIN.
[03:54:56] <bruda> FLT_MIN is 0
[03:55:03] <pragma-> it's not entirely clear to me what symbolic constant means. do you mean suffix ... oh.
[03:55:11] <bruda> So I'm guessing that's unsigned?
[03:55:18] <fizzie> No, all floats are signed.
[03:55:49] <tk> FLT_MIN is not the float equivalent of INT_MIN
[03:56:02] <tk> or rather
[03:56:11] <tk> hmm, why is your FLT_MIN 0 actually?
[03:56:13] <dave0> bruda: you can put postive numbers in a float and pretend negative numbers don't exist
[03:56:25] <tk> oh
[03:56:28] <fizzie> FLT_MIN isn't 0, you're probably just printing it wrong.
[03:56:32] <tk> yes, FLT_MIN is just the minimum representible float
[03:56:35] <bruda> That's what printf("FLT_MIN") gives me.
[03:56:38] <bruda> 0
[03:56:39] <tk> which is going to get rounded to 0
[03:56:42] * pragma- squints
[03:56:48] <tk> ah fuck it, english is hard
[03:56:54] <fizzie> ,cc printf("%e", FLT_MIN); // not zero
[03:56:57] <candide> fizzie: 1.175494e-38
[03:57:03] <bruda> and FLT_MAX comes out to a number longer than my wang.
[03:57:06] <tk> FLT_MIN is the minimum normalized positive floating-point number
[03:57:18] <tk> that - means it's very small not big
[03:57:21] <bruda> lol
[03:57:38] <fizzie> The negative value with the largest magnitude that's still finite is -FLT_MAX. (Unless the implementation defines some values outside the standard's model.)
[03:58:05] *** Quits: evocatus (~evocatus@213.193.2.105) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:59:01] <bruda> so "min" would be -FLT_MAX if I was keeping to the printed min's & max's I have so far.

[04:02:15] <dave0> hang on
[04:02:38] <bruda> The book mentioned float.h so I assumed I needed that to load the float related constants. It works in #include it seems.

[06:38:33] <caze> Why?
[06:38:58] <Dreamer3> trying to write a low-level `poke` routine
[06:39:11] <Dreamer3> but it's not assembling correctly
[06:39:24] <Dreamer3> it only moves a 16 bit pointer into the register, not 32 bit...
[06:39:41] <caze> Write it in assembly.
[06:40:00] <Dreamer3> well i'm wanting to know if I'm not understanging someting about C or if this is just a bug in the compiler
[06:40:15] <Dreamer3> i know how to do it in assembler, i was trying to learn how in C
[06:41:38] <caze> C doesn't really care about what your system does when you try to do that.
[06:41:46] <fizzie> "An integer may be converted to a poitner type. Except as previously specified [re null pointer constants], the result is implementation-defined, might not be correctly aligned, might not point to an entity of the referenced type, and might be a trap representation."
[06:41:50] <caze> ,c11 6.3.2.3p5
[06:41:52] <candide> http://www.iso-9899.info/n1570.html#6.3.2.3p5 [Pointers] An integer may be converted to any pointer type. Except as previously specified, t​he result is implementation-defined, might not be correctly aligned, might not point to an entity of t​he referenced type, and might be a trap representation.67) FOOTNOTE.67 T​he mapping functions for converting a pointer to an integer or an integer to a pointer... <truncated; https://0x0.st/-RUu.txt>
[06:42:34] <caze> So your system could do the most unexpected thing, and C wouldn't consider it a bug.
[06:42:36] <Dreamer3> good points
[06:43:08] <Dreamer3> i'm actually not sure it's wrong now... looking carefully at the opcode for MOVEA.W it's sign extended to 32 bits anyways *slaps forehead*
[06:44:35] <Dreamer3> thanks all!

[13:58:00] <dacav> Bou: why do you dislike it?
[13:58:09] <Bou> you wouldn't use Duff's device all over the place, only in code where every cycle counts, and then 3.5% is definitely significant
[13:59:15] *** Joins: karakedi (~eAC53C340@user/karakedi)
[13:59:26] <dacav> True.  I was reflecting on the topic of optimization, and I realised how a device like duff's needs constant monitoring, after you figured out that it makes a difference (in positive) in your code.
[13:59:53] <dacav> With this I mean that the gain/lose of performance might depend on the compiler in use
[14:00:32] <dacav> So in 5 years you're compiling with some super-clever compiler that doesn't digest the optimization you make, and suddenly a piece of code that used to work faster is now slower

[19:52:53] <riskoir> It there any alternative to strlen?
[19:52:56] <Beastie> riskoir: you should check if you char is actually unsigned, as it is quite common.
[19:53:15] <clarity> strlen is fine, and I don't believe your cast is breaking iyt
[19:53:25] <Beastie> have you #include <string.h> ??? 
[19:53:31] <riv> the alternative to strlen is to carry around a pair of char* data and int length
[19:53:42] <riskoir> Right, that's what I will do, thanks!
[19:53:46] <riv> tell us the warning, you shouldn't be casting
