For example, "Chinese", "French", etc.

[11:43:27] <kompowiec> :)
[11:44:12] <ns12> Maybe that's what makes such slurs attractive.
[11:45:00] <kompowiec> I think it may be due to history and the conquest of various areas. In Polish, I literally have no words to express myself in an offensive manner about a given nationality.
[11:46:00] <kompowiec> not count a few exceptions
[11:46:40] <twb> kompowiec: you can just call everyone a suka or pizdec :P
[11:46:51] <ns12> kompowiec: It is verbose to express "a Chinese national of mostly Dutch ancestry" in English. Does Polish make it easy to distinguish between nationality and ethnicity?
[11:47:39] <twb> ns12: in practice, most of the time it's either irrelevant (so not mentioned), or clear from context.
[11:47:56] <kompowiec> twb, yeah, polish profanity have a very extensive dictionary of such ordinary, non-racist curses
[11:48:14] <kompowiec> and therefore often untranslatable into English
[11:49:30] <twb> kompowiec: so like in Polish you never called Germans "cabbage-heads"?
[11:50:39] <kompowiec> ns12, my language contains inflexion and you can quite easily create different words with suffixes
[11:51:30] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terms_used_for_Germans#Poland
[11:52:13] <kompowiec> yeah we have some racial slurs but not for every nationality like English. For example in my language doesn't exist offensive word for jews
[11:54:06] <twb> I guess the main reason would be Poland didn't invade literally 50% of the world's land area >_>
[11:54:50] <kompowiec> and has historically protected the Jews
[11:55:10] <twb> My first random guess was gonna be Nuer people, but they would almost certainly be covered by the 19th century slur "fuzzie-wuzzies"
[11:55:41] <kompowiec> and basically Poland has probably never hurt anyone in history, mainly Poles were the victims of invasions of various other countries. But I'm not very good at history so sorry.
[11:59:54] <twb> I tried to prove that wrong, but at a glance we have to go back before Rus Czerwona, before invasions by Tatar, Ottoman, and Austrian empires

[22:03:06] <TimMc> Hard to come up with something that sounds right.
[22:03:19] <GuiToris> Google suggested 'for' but I didn't like it
[22:03:36] <TimMc> I usually just hear it as the set phrase "You can count on me" without anything after it.
[22:04:11] <GuiToris> maybe an easier word, how would you attach 'everything' to the end?
[22:06:34] <TimMc> Oh, yeah, "for everything" sounds a little better. But... it still feels odd.
