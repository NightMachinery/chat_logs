[00:01:46] <daoudr> I know I can do it with map but I want to get answers to this code
[00:01:53] <ljharb> daoudr: `return arr.map((item) => Math.max(...item));`
[00:02:11] <ljharb> daoudr: ok well, const/let is block-scoped, so if it was declared inside the loop it wouldn't be accessible outside it
[00:02:58] <daoudr> why largestNumberOfEachSubArray did not need let or const to be declared?
[00:04:53] <ljharb> daoudr: it should have been, but it's a bug in the code. it's creating a global variable.
[00:05:26] <daoudr> what do you mean bug in the code. do you mean JS is being forgiving?
[00:06:59] <ljharb> daoudr: yes
[00:07:16] <ljharb> daoudr: in sloppy mode, if you forget to declare a variable, it makes a global variable
[00:08:46] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[00:09:10] <daoudr> but js decides not to be sloppy and force me to declare arrayWithLargestNumbers. why is that?
[00:09:36] <ljharb> daoudr: because if you're using a linter or are in strict mode, that sloppy behavior was removed.
[00:09:51] <ljharb> daoudr: you should NEVER omit it. the declaration is good and important and necessary, and omitting it is incompetence
[00:11:20] <daoudr> so largestNumberOfEachSubArray even though it is inside the loop JS considers it global as if it is declared outside the loop
[00:12:31] <ljharb> daoudr: yes
[00:13:16] <daoudr> does js consider largestNumberOfEachSubArray a global variable as if it is outside the function too?

[09:35:01] <Decker> unless it was IE and required some custom activeX component
[09:35:40] <gde33> trying to get some ancient hp printer to work required a tool that requires flash :P

[16:58:49] <samsch> Axios is the library, it's the one that has to have a reason to use it.
[16:58:51] <stenno\OK> AlbertLast: fetch is built in
[16:59:00] <stenno\OK> yep
[16:59:07] <AlbertLast> not in nodejs?
[16:59:18] <stenno\OK> oh
[16:59:25] <samsch> The only reasons to use Axios IMO are if you wouldn't have to add a wrapper around either one for all requests anyway.
[17:00:05] <efdee> i always thought that you weren't really supposed to use fetch directly. that it was meant for people writing thigns like axios.
[17:00:08] <hassoon> FightingFalcon: cloudflare
[17:00:09] <efdee> (but i use fetch nonetheless)
[17:00:32] <samsch> Last time I tried to make a request in node nothing worked properly except node-fetch, which was kinda awkward since fetch is really designed around browser requests and the interface doesn't make as much sense on the server.

[17:47:45] <thykka> maybe just turn down screen brightness?
[17:47:51] <paulcarroty> yeah, I hate docs without dark mode
[17:48:28] <thykka> screen brightness should match the ambient light level. If your eyes hurt because "it's too white", chances are your screen is set too bright.
[17:48:30] <silly> oh yea, using the webcam and following the visitors eyes, whenever they look away, you change fonts, colors and reorder the entire site
[17:49:24] <thykka> and yes, modern displays are quite annoying, in that they usually hide the brightness settings behind some awful OSD menu
[17:49:33] <silly> hassoon, have you tried the auto dark script?
[17:49:56] <silly> thykka, you can automate that away
[17:50:11] <silly> search google for ddccontrol
[17:50:52] <thykka> silly, does it actually dim the backlight?
[17:51:06] <thykka> i guess, yeah
[17:51:08] <silly> it actually replaces the monitors osd
[17:52:30] <thykka> nice
[17:52:46] <thykka> most laptops seem to have button bindings for screen brightness, which is great
[17:53:21] <thykka> then there are software solutions like f.lux, but the problem with those is they compress the gamut
[17:53:48] <Alexendoo> My main monitor's 0 brightness isn't dim enough, quite an annoying problem

[18:56:53] <ljharb> [twisti]: when you have a static type system it's defensible. when you don't, it's an indefensible design.
[18:57:31] <ljharb> [twisti]: also even in those languages, method overloading can make for harder to maintain code, so i'm not sure those other languages disagree as hard as you think :-)

[23:33:20] <ljharb> humanBird: you should be rendering html and using a ref
[23:34:06] <humanBird> react-dnd uses refs for somethings but the behavior is terrible for the ghost image while dragging
[23:34:27] <ljharb> humanBird: refs are the only way to do it in react.
[23:34:32] <humanBird> so i'm going more towards native javascript for overriding this.
[23:34:34] <ljharb> humanBird: inline scripts are never a good way to do anything.

[23:36:52] <qswz> then don't use this lib

[23:39:41] <D4mned> you never use script tag inside jsx
[23:39:54] <humanBird> so react is totally broken then.
[23:40:02] <qswz> except possible server-rendered jsx
[23:40:09] <humanBird> things that subscribe event listeners aren't web components.

[23:41:52] <humanBird> a ref to what?  the image while it's dragging isn't an html element
[23:41:53] <qswz> then do the things in a useEffect / componentDidMount
[23:42:10] <qswz> a ref to the parent, then you querySelector it

[23:43:31] <qswz> humanBird: but your point doesn't ake sense
[23:43:43] <qswz> you can do the same event listener from your useEffect
[23:44:06] <qswz> in the same context, instead of adding another script, this is horrible
