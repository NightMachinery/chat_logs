[08:42:10] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> hosted RDS is VDI
[08:42:22] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> VDI is just a remote VM / remote shared VM

[08:45:52] <sd_> 05<f​irebarber> I already read that
[08:46:00] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> it's like calling azure workspaces "hosted VDI"
[08:46:01] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> yes
[08:46:03] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> you're right
[08:46:12] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> in the same manner of speaking that me running an RDS host and giving you a login
[08:46:13] <sd_> 05<f​irebarber> I guess “managed and hosted” RDS and VDI is more descriptive
[08:46:14] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> is also hosted VDI
[08:46:43] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> bit more covered in it than taht

[08:48:16] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> with all the management stack integration, etc
[08:48:23] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> remember - you're still managing the OS/apps/users/policies/etc
[08:48:32] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> so it's not like the remote host is managing anything except the azure bits for you
[08:48:42] <sd_> 05<f​irebarber> VSI provides a dedicated VM per user, usually of a desktop OS. RDS is multi-user per VM and typically a server OS and fewer resources per user
[08:49:03] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> VDI can be sessions on an RDS host or individual VMs
[08:49:23] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> remember though, RDS is what you're using when you RDP to a single win10 VM instance too 🙂
[08:49:32] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> even if it's not multiuser capabale
[08:49:55] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> RDP's just the protocol that talks to the remote RDS host

[11:23:25] <JollyRgrs> lol... this kid
[11:23:35] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> you ever open a ticket on it?
[11:23:38] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[11:23:42] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> no I just swapped to monthly
[11:23:44] <xe0n> YOU EVER TICKETED BRO?!
[11:23:46] <xe0n> LOL
[11:23:47] <JollyRgrs> lol
[11:23:53] <JollyRgrs> "what could go wrong?"
[11:23:59] <xe0n> "yes"
[11:24:00] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> nothing in 5 years
[11:24:17] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> so less than what went wrong while in semi annual
[11:24:29] <xe0n> aka you mean you get the fixes faster, thats not wrong
[11:24:34] <JollyRgrs> the semi-annual build was ONE of the monthlies
[11:24:37] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> yeah
[11:24:40] <xe0n> lolll
[11:24:50] <JollyRgrs> so the same bug was in the monthly that you installed, too
[11:24:57] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> no it wasn't
[11:24:59] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> it was patched
[11:25:11] <JollyRgrs> no, that was a newer monthly build you are referring to then
[11:25:26] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> monthly builds come out every month
[11:25:37] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> Beta builds only come out for testing a couple weeks before release
[11:25:48] <JollyRgrs> semi-annual channel is on 2008... but i think just this patch tues, they bumped up to 2103... which is what the preview channel has been on the last 4 months
[11:25:58] <JollyRgrs> at one point, 2008 and 2103 were both a monthly build

[11:26:08] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> yeah so it's not semi-annual (beta), it's monthly preview
[11:26:17] <JollyRgrs> they lock them in for the semi-annual channels and just do security patches on THAT MONTHLY BUILD for 6 mo.
[11:26:19] <xe0n> WTF are we even talking about anymore
[11:26:20] <xe0n> jeez
[11:26:37] <xe0n> COOL STORY BRRRROOOOOOO

[11:26:44] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> JollyRgrs: it may have been a feature change that manfiested to him as a bug and he didn't open a ticket so has no clue
[11:26:46] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> best guess for now
[11:26:56] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> rofl
[11:27:00] <xe0n> copter
[11:27:05] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> and they backed off that feature change in the monthly builds?
[11:27:12] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> nice one
[11:27:15] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> Quite possibly, yes.
[11:27:25] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> Without having a ticket response to know, none of us can accurately answer.
[11:27:25] <JollyRgrs> who knows? it's the monthlies
[11:27:32] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> cool, so they left a broken build in the semi-annual for 6 months
[11:27:37] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> because they didn't want to remove a feature
[11:27:38] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> "broken"
[11:27:47] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> well, that's kind of the point of the semi-annual
[11:27:55] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> there was literally a KB that had a workaround that just said "don't do it"
[11:28:02] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> cool
[11:28:07] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> I think it was the save all attachments button?
[11:28:09] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> so they left it as is and did security only on the semi annual
[11:28:13] <sd_> 02<H​unterkll> like the docs say
[11:28:27] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> The new feature in semi-annual that didn't make it to monthly was "break the save all attachments"

[11:35:00] <xe0n> LOL
[11:35:00] <xe0n> fuck
[11:35:29] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: but no! preview and beta mean the same thing. webster's said so!
[11:35:33] <JollyRgrs> so it must be true!
[11:35:34] <xe0n> preview = opportunity to test those outlook add-ons, the dymo label things, your macros, and whatever else you depend on
[11:35:56] <xe0n> you find a problem in the preview build, you halt rollout of the next build until you can resolve
[11:35:57] <JollyRgrs> it's UAT (user acceptance testing)
[11:36:00] <xe0n> yes!
[11:36:01] <xe0n> LOL
[11:36:11] <DrZak> dont be a pussy, test in prod
[11:36:28] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> yeah so a guy trying to diagnose a bug in the current outlook client should wait 5 months for the next preview build to come out
[11:36:39] <JollyRgrs> you do beta builds, then you get the final build and push to a test env. to make sure "it works". then you push to UAT to make sure all the features work and none are broken
[11:36:42] <xe0n> wtf he didnt even mention what channel he is on
[11:36:44] <xe0n> lol jeez
[11:37:10] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> and installing a monthly build on his own device will take down the entire organisation
[11:37:10] <JollyRgrs> hey xe0n since i test the monthly windows patches to a UAT group first, does that make the patches "beta" patches?
[11:37:26] <xe0n> xoxo: no, that breaks SOE.
[11:37:27] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> because it's not as secure as "preview" builds
[11:37:28] <JollyRgrs> IDGAF what "one user" does
[11:37:29] <xe0n> and maybe your patching
[11:37:32] <JollyRgrs> you shouldn't have to manage at that level
[11:37:34] <xe0n> and whatever else you've put in place
[11:37:40] <JollyRgrs> who said anything about "secure"?
[11:37:46] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> right, so you can't use the preview build either because that breaks SOE too
[11:37:51] <JollyRgrs> no...
[11:37:53] <xe0n> oO
[11:38:02] <xe0n> [2021.07.15.16:52:15] <xe0n> SCCM TESTING RINGS YO!
[11:38:27] <DrZak> you have a date and time in seconds in your irc chat?
[11:38:29] <xe0n> if you're in semi-annual channel, you're typically managing two channels - the semi-annual, and the semi-annual preview
[11:38:33] <xe0n> you throw a random monthly into that
[11:38:39] <xe0n> unless you've done the needful to manage that install
[11:38:44] <xe0n> it effectively breaks SOE
[11:39:07] <JollyRgrs> now, if you want to also manage a small group who run monthly... change your SOE/SOP and have at it
[11:39:11] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> don't use preview builds at all
[11:39:14] <JollyRgrs> but I really don't want to add more channels to my plate

[15:48:43] <xe0n> Phininx: there is no demo lol
[15:49:05] <xe0n> wtf do you want a demo of, you already run windows
[15:49:11] <xe0n> its the windows we all know and love, virtualised in the cloud
[15:49:12] <xe0n> thats it
[15:49:20] <xe0n> through either the web browser or remote desktop client
[15:49:42] <estranger> is pcoip still the shit?
[15:50:46] <Rpifan> Why can't we just use Linux 
[15:51:29] <xe0n> capital R!
[15:51:35] <xe0n> is that your upgrade when you came over to libera :P
[15:53:34] <xe0n> https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly/episodes/733?autostart=false have a listen it will answer some of your questions re: windows 365
[15:54:33] <Rpifan> Nop just mobile making auto caps 
[15:54:39] <xe0n> haha
[15:56:38] <Rpifan> But what os do you boot to get into windows 365
[15:56:54] <xe0n> any device with a html5 browswer or remote desktop client
[15:57:03] <xe0n> mac\windows\ipad\iphone\android\whatever
[15:57:06] <xe0n> chromebook
[15:57:37] <xe0n> windows 365 is the service name, but it's standard windows 10 and 11
[15:59:25] <xe0n> you connect to a hosted desktop already, be it rds, citrix, vnc, whatever? windows 365...
[15:59:26] <xe0n> lol
[16:01:00] <Rpifan> Maybe they'll make a cloud efi
[16:01:06] <xe0n> lol what
[16:01:59] <xe0n> https://getnerdio.com/academy-enterprise/microsoft-windows-365-vs-azure-virtual-desktop-avd-comparing-two-daas-products/
[16:02:10] <xe0n> good comparison, hunter posted it earlier

[16:02:31] <Rpifan> Boot to Web direct from efi
[16:02:48] <xe0n> errr its not meant to be anythign like that?
[16:03:16] <xe0n> this isnt a new os or a replacement for an os, it's more "device doesn't matter, as long as you have internet we'll give you a desktop and apps"
[16:03:29] <xe0n> ala avd
[16:03:30] <xe0n> lol!
[16:03:42] <Rpifan> So why double boot winblows
[16:03:53] <CptLuxx> just use whatever you want?
[16:03:54] <xe0n> this isn't for consumer, it's a business feature
[16:04:07] <xe0n> if businesses want to provide their workers an environment to work in, this is one choice
[16:04:08] <xe0n> lol!
[16:04:25] <xe0n> its not replacing anything, it's another service offering with a different service model and price model
[16:04:26] <Rpifan> Ahh
[16:04:26] <xe0n> llol!
[16:04:28] <Rpifan> Got it
[16:04:41] <Rpifan> Dumb but sure could be Apple 
[16:06:35] <aab_> this is for business 
[16:06:42] <xe0n> absolutely
[16:06:43] <aab_> I'm assuming it's to streamline 
[16:07:19] <xe0n> it's a service offering based on a per user subscription instead of being based on consumption like avd
[16:07:20] <xe0n> lol
[16:07:34] <xe0n> this isn't to streamline anything, it's another flat rate subscription offering
[16:07:45] <xe0n> you have 20 users who need desktops? pay for 20 user licenses, done
[16:08:05] <xe0n> no need to worry about how long they're logged in, how much io the machine is using, how many dollars its costing while no one uses it (avd)
[16:08:09] <aab_> thing is you still going to have to buy software so this desktop is another cost to a business
[16:08:13] <aab_> for example 
[16:08:14] <aab_> sage
[16:08:19] <xe0n> exactly!
[16:08:21] <xe0n> its not saving ANYTHING
[16:08:22] <aab_> still a license cost
[16:08:36] <aab_> unless microsoft saves the business money by bundling software
[16:08:40] <aab_> pre-installed desktops
[16:08:41] <xe0n> wtf are you on about
[16:08:55] <xe0n> this is purely giving you a hosted environment for you to do _whatever_
[16:09:04] <xe0n> and its cost is based on a per user model, not consumption
[16:09:04] <xe0n> LOL
[16:09:11] <aab_> not a good model then 
[16:09:14] <xe0n> what?!
[16:09:26] <xe0n> have you read any of the material about it lol
[16:09:29] <aab_> since you would just install software on the desktop you already have saving the cost of a hosted environment
[16:09:32] <xe0n> i think you're confused at what is being marketed towards
[16:09:34] <aab_> it's launched in a browser isn't it ?
[16:09:58] <xe0n> or the remote desktop client, yes
[16:10:07] <xe0n> its a hosted environment, just like VDI always has been
[16:10:07] <xe0n> lol!
[16:10:16] <aab_> meh
[16:10:22] <aab_> doesn't make sense to me
[16:10:42] <xe0n> the thing that will attract smb to it is the pricing model
[16:10:43] <xe0n> thats the entire point
[16:10:44] <xe0n> LOL
[16:10:56] <xe0n> but having said that
[16:11:00] <xe0n> ...word is it wont be cheap either
[16:11:01] <xe0n> haha
[16:11:01] <xe0n> so
[16:11:03] <xe0n> who knows
[16:11:05] <xe0n> microsoft ayyy
[16:11:06] <aab_> will it boot without having an os installed via pxe boot or something
[16:11:11] <xe0n> what?!
[16:11:12] <xe0n> no!
[16:11:21] <aab_> then there is no point having that as a desktop
[16:11:22] <xe0n> you're expected to have a working device to connect to the internet
[16:11:30] <aab_> your just adding cost 
[16:11:35] <xe0n> i think you're missing the point, it's standard windows 10 or 11
[16:11:45] <aab_> but you need an os for it to work in the first place
[16:11:46] <xe0n> and it's microsoft hosting the remote environment for your employees
[16:11:55] <xe0n> instead of you having to buy the infrastructure yourself
[16:12:04] <aab_> so instead of vpn for example
[16:12:04] <xe0n> and instead of paying for virtual machines via a consumption model, you pay per user
[16:12:07] <aab_> got ya
[16:12:19] <aab_> suppose it makes sense
[16:12:25] <aab_> then the end users won't need to vpn into work
[16:12:26] <xe0n> it's hosted RDS
[16:12:30] <aab_> ahhhhh
[16:12:31] <xe0n> jeez does that make it easier to understand?!
[16:12:32] <xe0n> LOL!
[16:12:36] <aab_> I haven't read any of the material yet
[16:12:40] <xe0n> it's fucking RDS, we've been using it for YEARS
[16:12:42] <aab_> I'm just blasting out questions
[16:12:43] <xe0n> in our own data centers
[16:12:45] <xe0n> now they host it for us
[16:12:46] <xe0n> boom
[16:12:47] <xe0n> jeez
[16:12:48] <xe0n> lol
[16:12:48] <xe0n> !
[16:12:51] <aab_> what's the cost per user
[16:12:57] <xe0n> hasnt been released yet
[16:13:03] <DrZak> :))))
[16:13:24] <aab_> interesting, ill be watching this like a hawk
[16:13:33] <DrZak> a) cant connect to onprem appos
[16:13:37] <xe0n> yeah it may be a good option for some businesses
[16:13:47] <aab_> we currently have 85 companies with vpn set up which has been a long process
[16:13:48] <xe0n> it wont fit everyones needs, hence...avd
[16:13:48] <DrZak> b) it will tell your boss most of you are worthless waste of oxygen

[16:14:22] <xe0n> read that...
[16:14:22] <xe0n> lol
[16:14:27] <aab_> let me read it 
[16:14:39] <xe0n> no thats the difference, they see the business tier of cloud pc as being managed by ms

[16:15:31] <Rpifan> Question is why pay for this won't it be ridiculously expensive 
[16:16:06] <xe0n> because it'll still be cheaper than hosting your own infrastructure and dealing with what comes along with that
[16:16:07] <xe0n> LOL
[16:16:21] <DrZak> rpifan strikes again
[16:16:32] <xe0n> but yeah chances are...people will complain about the price, but heyt his is for business, so think volume license etc etc, will always be cheaper
[16:16:39] <aab_> ah nice that explains it all
[16:16:41] <xe0n> but guess what? this aint for consumers
[16:16:43] <xe0n> so consumers can stfu

[16:17:36] <DrZak> i have 2
[16:17:49] <aab_> when you do a cost analysis of the current way people use remote desktop we have two kinds one where they remote into their own desktop and the other is using vdi desktops 
[16:17:55] <DrZak> mine is almost mint
[16:18:03] <aab_> so as long as the per user licence is cheaper it's a win win
[16:18:14] <xe0n> well cloud pc IS per user LOL
[16:18:16] <xe0n> thats the license model
[16:18:20] <xe0n> so its more...how much does each tier cost

[16:18:40] <DrZak> i have 8, 5,25 and 3,5
[16:18:47] <aab_> for a user to remote in they need their pcs switched on literally 24/7 which is a power cost

[16:19:51] <aab_> you might not but our users do, some of our companies wouldn't buy the vdi server
[16:19:58] <aab_> they needed a cheaper solution

[16:30:40] <meconium> the tldr is that you use iscsi where you want to present network storage as block level
[16:31:02] <Rpifan> Is there a reason to not just Fibre for everything 
[16:31:19] <Rpifan> I suppose the interface Cards are the limitants 
[16:31:23] <teh_f4ll3n> cost?
[16:31:47] <Rpifan> The fiber itself isn't to expensive or so I've been told 
[16:32:53] <teh_f4ll3n> it's not, but it IS additional cost as you'll need to get FO cards / SFP+ plugs for everything
[16:33:41] <Rpifan> When are those projected to come down to the cost of a normal nic or are they meant to not come down 
[16:34:48] <teh_f4ll3n> not really, most of the time you're looking at an SFP socket on a NIC and whatever SFP modules you need to make it work
[16:36:15] <teh_f4ll3n> I think it's easier for the companies like Mellanox to make a generic SFP card rated for certain speed and let the user pick the TX SFP modules depending on the range requred
[16:37:29] <teh_f4ll3n> So, until we see a mass shift to FO for general networking, things will stay as they are

[22:18:14] <oxipital> i'm so wanting one
[22:18:15] <sintax> good!
[22:18:19] <sintax> what are they down to?
[22:18:19] <xythrez> Well I was referring to indie console that fails sense
[22:18:23] <Sousapro> But it was rocking death stranding and control 
[22:18:48] <xythrez> Also in terms of emulators, get a 3ds. They are pretty hackable and make good retro consoles
[22:18:50] <Sousapro> xythrez: why would it? Plays steam games locally, supports full desktop mode, not locked down
[22:19:14] <xythrez> Didn't that happen a few years ago with the ooya or something?
[22:19:58] <sd_> 09<Q​uasky> didnt the ooya fail to follow through and broke it backing contract? Or was that someone else who tried to the game-box machine?
[22:20:04] <oxipital> i have an anbernic that i love
[22:20:15] <Sousapro> The thing is you don't have to make custom games for it
[22:20:21] <Sousapro> You can load other game stores
[22:20:33] <sintax> and still no half life 3
[22:20:41] <Sousapro> This is a gaming handheld ultra book effectively 
[22:20:46] <Sousapro> I think it's going to rock 
[22:20:58] <Sousapro> $399 though

[22:22:36] <Sousapro> Yes

[22:22:46] <Sousapro> Nothing plays remastered well
[22:22:46] <sintax> :)
[22:22:54] <Sousapro> Original crysis? Yes
[22:23:02] <Sousapro> I'd bet 60fps on medium 
[22:23:09] <Sousapro> They were playing control on it
[22:23:19] <oxipital> it doesn't fit in a pocket. 
[22:23:22] <Sousapro> That's not exactly an easy game to run off of battery 
[22:23:26] <xythrez> No offense but I think I'll get more enjoyment out of an old BSD machine with nethack than a 400 dollar handheld PC
