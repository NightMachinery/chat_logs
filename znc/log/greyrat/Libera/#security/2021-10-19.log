[00:12:07] <wroathe> So as I contractor I keep running into a variety of different policies for how companies handle developer workstations and shared environments. I'm talking like fortune 1000 scale companies. In some cases it's that developers have full local administrative rights and can do whatever they want, and in other other cases, like this most recent gig, they're trying to tell me that even installing development
[00:12:13] <wroathe> software on my laptop is against corporate policy
[00:12:29] <wroathe> So I've been trying to think through what an ideal solution for a very large corporation might be while they work out what to do with me
[00:13:14] <wroathe> My thoughts are that all developer workstations and lower environment servers within an enterprise should be in a "lab" or "sandbox" network that is completely airgapped away from the enterprise proper
[00:14:22] <Gerlo> we do something similar at the lab i'm at. unmanaged desktop networks vs managed ones.
[00:14:29] <Gerlo> completely airgapped is another story
[00:18:16] <wroathe> Yeah, it's interesting. At this latest gig the infosec people have a special kind of smugness when they talk about how locked down they've got developers.
[00:18:54] <wroathe> From my point of view that's just the height of laziness. It's easy to be a security professional that locks everything down.
[00:19:14] <wroathe> "Can I..." "No." "What about...?" "No. "But what if...?" "No."
[00:19:37] <wroathe> A good security professional would dig in and try to solution around providing the super technical folks with a solid way to work

[00:23:59] <MadCamel> I work in an extremely restricitive environment where installing unapproved software can get you fired. We have a lab for that, but moving production data or code in/out of the lab is also prohibited so it's not terribly useful
[00:24:24] <wroathe> Well, that's the thing: development staff should have nothing to do with production environments or production data
[00:24:25] <MadCamel> The official solution from management is just: Deal with it. We don't care if it takes 30x as long.
[00:24:46] *** Joins: Hubert6 (~Hubert@gifi.cassossie.net)
[00:25:06] <wroathe> The default should be for almost all of the development workforce to be in a sandboxed airgapped network away from the production environments
[00:25:22] <wroathe> With rights to their workstations, and a high degree of reporting and auditability
[00:26:23] <MadCamel> Production code as well. I can't write software on my lab linux machine for use anywhere else but the lab. The lab's an untrusted environment and the software could've been tampered with.
[00:26:25] <wroathe> That goes for workstations and lower environments both. To go from say a "UAT" or a "staging" environment within the sandbox to a production environment should involve a process
[00:26:42] *** Hubert6 is now known as NoelFlantier
[00:27:10] <wroathe> It's only production code if it's deployed in a production environment :P. If you're talking about sensitive trade secret algorithms then that's a different story

[00:28:21] <MadCamel> I mean any type of automation whatsoever. It's a pretty hellish work environment tbh. For instance about 4 hours out of my 8 hour workday is spent clicking buttons in JIRA that I could automate with a 10 line shell script and curl :)

[00:28:46] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.48)
[00:29:16] <wroathe> Right, but I'm not overly concerned about what the worst examples are doing. I'm trying to think through what an ideal solution might be.
[00:29:41] <wroathe> In the hypothetical case that I got side-loaded in as the CIO of a fortune 500 company, how might I organize this?
[00:29:52] <wroathe> I just this it's wholly unacceptable to treat expensive developers in that way
[00:31:22] <Gerlo> The biggest challenge we need to figure out an efficient way for scientists to use containers in a shared computer environment
[00:31:24] <MadCamel> Aside from the lab, We go dev environment(fully managed, no admin privs, no unapproved software) -> uat -> prod. Each transition has a higher level of assurance. There are automated and manual reviews triggered for each promotion.
[00:31:47] <MadCamel> Which IMO is a reasonable way to do things

[00:33:38] <MadCamel> Absolutely. But how do you balance giving people the tools they need with security?
[00:33:39] <Gerlo> I know sysadmins who do that
[00:34:01] <Gerlo> MadCamel: I don't think there's a blanket solution. ime it's case-by-case
[00:34:01] <wroathe> Like if some schmuck were to install nginx, and then a few days later a CVE comes out that says that an attacker can gain remote access to the machine through that version of nginx
[00:34:14] <wroathe> And their running nginx and letting it listen on their LAN nic
[00:34:52] <wroathe> From my point of view the way to solve that is 1. Sandboxing, and 2. Transparency (reporting)
[00:35:32] <MadCamel> wroathe: on a company system at my org all new CVEs are cross-referenced with the inventory and everyone responsible for a vulnerable system has 30 days(or less if it's serious) to patch it.
[00:35:42] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@89nnjg0xckz9ggn6r5xm.ip6.superloop.com)
[00:35:52] <wroathe> Let the developers manage their own software, but periodically run a report that lists what versions of what are running as services on the developer machines, and then flags if they've let any of those services get out of date
[00:36:34] <wroathe> But then sandbox them anyway, so that the worst that can happen is that an attacker can read non-trade secret code from the company's internal repositories

[00:43:50] <wroathe> MadCamel: Yeah, it honestly blows my mind. In my opinion infosec and network security people that let this happen to an enterprise should be fired and publicly shamed
[00:43:58] <wroathe> Instead, they're promoted.
[00:45:04] <MadCamel> I'm infosec/host security in one of these environments and let me tell you none of this was my idea. It all comes down from the risk management weenies.
[00:45:58] <wroathe> risk management... lawyers?
[00:45:59] <wroathe> Or what?
[00:46:22] <wroathe> Do these risk management people have an IT background?
[00:47:10] <MadCamel> There are people who's job it is to find gaps in our security posture and figure out how much risk that exposes us to. And it's not the engineering department, it's former engineers that got promoted and are extremely out of touch.
[00:49:03] <MadCamel> Also because it's their primary duty they will always find more gaps and issues. If they stop finding issues then what are they there for? So the requirements grow progressively more strict. It's not an engineering problem it's a management problem
[00:49:05] <wroathe> Ah. I think those are precisely the people I'm referring to. I'm not sure if they're always consistently called risk management though?

[01:03:40] <wroathe> Anyway, in general my point is that not giving developers rights to install their preferred tooling on their workstation is a bit like hiring a chef and telling them they can't use knives or heat. If IT leadership within a large enterprise allows that to happen, they should be fired.
[01:03:53] <MadCamel> it turns out that the longer an enterprise system is around the more complex it becomes. dealing with the complexity requires resources and people. Eventually the system will be replaced but the cycle just starts all over.

[02:43:32] <wroathe> Some of the large enterprises I've worked for in the past have given developers full local administrative rights and just said "godspeed". Others have tried to limit the windows where they have admin rights by forcing the developer to request admin rights for 5 minutes or so with a note about what they're going to use them for. Others still have said no admin rights whatsoever but installing software
[02:43:38] <wroathe> without them is allowed. This current one I'm at says no installing software regardless of rights.
[02:43:51] *** Quits: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[02:43:56] <wroathe> Presumably they've got like a self-service tool somewhere that lets developers request specific pieces of software that undergo a review process
[02:44:35] <wroathe> The reduced window approach is no better than just giving them full local admin rights security-wise
[02:45:22] <wroathe> I think this has to be accomplished by designing the network in such a way that if a developer's workstation is compromised there's minimal impact to the enterprise, and so that it's easy to to trace when something could potentially go wrong
[02:46:08] <Apachez> but compromise nowadays also goes through source code
[02:46:28] <Apachez> classic is when devs commits their private keys to some public git store
[02:46:46] <Apachez> its like throwing backdoors after the ones you dont wish to be lurking in your network :P
[02:47:00] <wroathe> I see also some sysadmins talking about having developers use development VMs. I personally don't understand how a developer can tolerate that. I require a _responsive_ workstation to get anything done, and accessing a VM over RDP is anything but that
[02:47:06] <Apachez> I have even seen signing keys being thrown into the public by clueless devs
[02:47:09] <Apachez> that was hilarious :D
[02:47:27] <wroathe> Yeah, I'm certainly not saying that developers are all universally capable or cautious people
[02:47:29] <Apachez> why wouldnt a rdp session be responsive?

[02:54:13] <vonunov> (Now offering On-Demand Infinitely Scalable Cloud-Based Vim Remote IDE Instances, only 1 cent a second)
[02:54:22] <Apachez> vonunov: vim? real men (and female) use echo ;)
[02:54:24] <wroathe> What controls would need to be in place to support that, and what disadvantages would there be?
[02:54:44] <vonunov> Apachez: After managing a few cute regexes I have had thoughts of trying to do everything in sed :P
[02:55:02] <wroathe> (Also keep in mind that some fortune 500 companies STILL allow developers to have local admin rights without having effectively answered this question)

[02:56:40] <Apachez> wroathe: why would they need local admin?
[02:56:47] <Apachez> let them run a vm where they got local admin
[02:57:09] <wroathe> Apachez: As I said above, there's no way to make that feel as responsive as just having a laptop with their tooling installed on it
[02:57:20] <wroathe> Apachez: And everyone has a right to choose what they put up with in their work
[02:57:38] <Apachez> vm can be runned locally
[02:57:40] <wroathe> Apachez: There's plenty of talented developers who have drawn a line in the sand and said "fuck that" in response to the VM solution
[02:57:45] <Apachez> ever heard of virtualbox?
[02:57:46] <vonunov> Apachez: That's cool, it looks like something I could get into one day if the internet connection goes down for a while :D
[02:57:58] <wroathe> Apachez: You need local admin rights to run a hypervisor in many cases
[02:58:00] <Apachez> the issue you have is that you cant get both
[02:58:05] <wroathe> Apachez: hypervisor.framework requires it
[02:58:08] <Apachez> either you want security or you want flexibility
[02:58:12] <Apachez> or some degress in between
[02:58:17] <Apachez> you cant get both sliders to 100%
[02:58:19] <Apachez> at once
[02:58:22] <wroathe> Apachez: virtualbox used to require a kernel extension
[02:58:36] <wroathe> Apachez: hyper-v requires you to enable it's windows feature, which requires local admin rights
[02:58:53] <Apachez> if you want your devs to be local admin on the physical box then you dont care about security or segment stuff
[02:59:03] <Apachez> you only enable it once
[02:59:08] <Joanna> wroathe: I think as always it’s a balance between security and convenience
[02:59:09] <wroathe> Apachez: Or we just haven't answered the question I posed above effectively yet
[02:59:17] <Apachez> no need for local admin to run hyperv stuff after its been activated
[03:00:25] <vonunov> The main issue is DLP for the source code right? Or is it about local admin in general being an ez vector?
[03:00:36] <Apachez> there are several issues
[03:00:57] <wroathe> Apachez: Using a local VM is a potential solution, but even then most hypervisors tend to add quite a bit of overhead that slows things down. I understand what you're saying about the sliders, but I'd say that it's worth considering the original question: How would one design a network to be resilient in the face of local administrator workstations being compromised
[03:00:59] <vonunov> There are several issues 24/7 :v
[03:01:03] <Apachez> if we talk about windows you are in deep sh*t if you get local admins
[03:01:19] <Apachez> so les assume you got linux clients instead
[03:01:37] <Apachez> the problem is how the source code is being handled on an unauthrotized box where you have zero logging of
[03:01:55] <Apachez> and after what junk is actually being commited back to the source servers?
[03:02:12] <Apachez> if the client is pwned then both source code alteration and commits can be done without dev being present
[03:02:21] <Apachez> SSO is sometimes worser than just using l/p ;)
[03:02:50] <wroathe> vonunov: I don't necessarily think that DLP prevention is a concern in the face of this. Your SCM shouldn't allow developers to delete things anyway (it should be additive)
[03:03:11] <wroathe> So even with local admin rights they wouldn't be able to delete code in the central repos
[03:03:15] <vonunov> gee, this is a pain in the ass, no wonder people get paid so much to pontificate security policy :V
[03:03:17] <Apachez> DLP only helps to trigger accidently moved data
[03:03:24] <Apachez> it wont help if its encrypted or obfuscated
[03:03:35] <Joanna>  Isn’t there a way to lockdown workstations at certain times of day when nobody should be using them?

[03:03:41] <vonunov> Oh yeah lol
[03:03:41] <ajak> Apachez: the VCS server could authenticate commits, requiring commits to be signed via a yubi or something
[03:03:57] <wroathe> Joanna: I don't necessarily think that helps. See what I was saying above about temporary admin access
[03:04:03] <Apachez> its like people having a firewall and think they are save because they use "any, any, accept - but hey we got an expensive firewall!"
[03:04:28] <wroathe> If a developer requests temporary access to install software that compromises their system, who cares that the access was only during a 5 minute window?
[03:04:51] <Apachez> ajak: if wroathes devs cant use vm because "latency" then they will for sure not be able to use yubikey either =)
[03:05:21] * wroathe doesn't know what yubikey is
[03:05:40] <Apachez> wroathe: a hardware token
[03:05:40] <ajak> hardware private key thing
[03:06:10] <wroathe> I think the question is this: In the hypothetical case where developers are given local administrative access to their workstations, how would you design an enterprise network to be resilient in the face of those workstations being compromised
[03:06:11] <vonunov> I was having vague thoughts of some sort-of-closed/tightly-controlled system for checking out source on a strict need basis with chain of custody / change records? I dunno, I've done NGFW/VPN tech support but not dev-infra-stuff
[03:06:14] <ajak> theoretically makes it so you can be sure a PGP signed thing was signed by the owner of the hardware (rather than someone who stole a private key off a disk)

[03:06:17] <secbot> ^ Which YubiKey is right for you | Quiz | Yubico
[03:06:21] <wroathe> Apachez: Even the local VM thing doesn't actually effectively solve this when you think about it
[03:06:42] <wroathe> Apachez: Because they'll still be installing software that compromises that VM, and that will expose that compromised service potentially to the network
[03:06:54] <Apachez> wroathe: in short you cant... what you can do is to segment away from these clients... only allow for per service login as in no AD interaction etc
[03:07:09] <ajak> i really think the key here would be any central resource being authenticated very strongly, such as via a yubikey or similar device
[03:07:22] <Apachez> wroathe: the point is that its the vm who is compromised not the box itself

[03:07:37] <jessicara> i am an idiot, but backups and over the network least privilege required to do their job, which sometimes is a lot, there's also having good practices at handling user data
[03:07:42] <Apachez> the vm can have a known good start so reboot it and its fresh from the readonly iso
[03:07:51] <wroathe> Apachez: Right, but that doesn't matter. If the developer doesn't know the VM is compromised, and the VM is running whenever they're working, then it's the same as if the host itself were compromised
[03:08:11] <Apachez> wroathe: I assume even a dev sleep sometimes?
[03:08:43] <jessicara> also, people seem to turn off logging for privacy concerns, but these logs tell you who did what when in the case someone does something nasty

[03:10:01] <Apachez> including porn =)
[03:10:12] <wroathe> Apachez: Whether or not they sleep isn't the issue. When their workstation isn't sleeping, and either the host or the VM is compromised, then that's the worst case scenario we're describing
[03:10:15] <Joanna> It might be old fashioned and slow but wouldn’t it be more secure to only allow Software to be installed on machines manually instead of being downloaded off the internet?
[03:10:28] <jessicara> yes and no
[03:10:47] <jessicara> i'd suggest non-shared blu ray/dvd drives
[03:10:50] <ajak> that wouldn't make any sense
[03:10:54] <jessicara> because a dvd/blu ray has no firmware
[03:11:03] <jessicara> the drive does, but the disc doesn't
[03:11:05] <Apachez> wroathe: then schedule it to be rebooted every 24h, problem solved - NEXT!
[03:11:16] <ajak> that doesn't make any sense either, it's not 2000 anymore
[03:11:24] <Joanna> Or maybe a local server that is not connected to the internet
[03:11:29] <wroathe> Actually, when you think about this it's the same problem as securing VMs within a data center. The sysadmins on reddit were saying that they allow developers to transfer installers and binaries to these VMs where they have administrative rights to install them
[03:11:35] <Apachez> "installed on machines manually" meaning what?
[03:11:36] <Apachez> from a dvd?
[03:11:36] <ajak> how does the local server get packages?
[03:11:39] <wroathe> It's the same question there: What if these VMs are compromised
[03:11:49] <vonunov> Well, suppose you have: Network segregation (how many resources on the rest of the network do dev machines need to access? Do they even need to be able to see each other or just reach the repo, the KB, and the internet?), and like, endpoint security on the bare host, a tailored firewall policy on their vlan -- How broad a range of stuff do they need access to? This sounds like something where it
[03:11:53] <Apachez> so you download your malwarized setup.exe from internet, burn it on dvd... and that would solve this issue how? :P
[03:11:54] <jessicara> it really depends on requirements i guess
[03:11:55] <vonunov> would only be moderately painful to build a reliable whitelist in various places
[03:12:03] <Apachez> the good thing is that this dvd is stored for later
[03:12:09] <wroathe> Apachez: How does rebooting the VM help with this?
[03:12:13] <Apachez> compared to if runned form usb who can be altered over time
[03:12:14] <jessicara> i think if you are smuggling in through an airgap and inspecting everything closely are not just developing a game or something..
[03:12:23] <Apachez> wroathe: back to known good state
[03:12:24] <wroathe> Apachez: When it comes back up it'll still be compromised
[03:12:34] <wroathe> Apachez: Oh, you're saying re-provision the VM every 24h
[03:12:37] <wroathe> Not reboot it
[03:12:38] <Apachez> no
[03:12:49] <Apachez> I say reboot it from known good state like a readonly iso file
[03:13:41] <Apachez> jessicara: if you do that already with your first hello world then it becomes second nature :P
[03:13:48] <jessicara> i guess
[03:14:04] <Apachez> its like when it comes to education of c/c++
[03:14:11] <Apachez> why dont they start with pointers at day 1 ?
[03:14:15] <Apachez> to make people code properly
[03:14:19] <jessicara> at least hopefully once they are in the vm they can play around creatively
[03:14:32] <Apachez> instead they spend the first half year of coding without knowing about pointers and what they are and why you use them
[03:14:45] <Apachez> and then half the class have a hard time to understand it and change how they are coding
[03:14:48] <jessicara> no idea about that, i didn't learn anything like that through school
[03:14:48] <wroathe> This is tricky, because the workstation or a local VM is connected to the internet through a nat or a proxy. I suppose the remote VM solution is slightly more secure in the sense that an attacker won't be able to talk to the VM through the firewall in the data center
[03:14:55] <Joanna> Don’t some companies have specific employees responsible for installing all software with media obtained directly from manufacturers not off the internet?
[03:14:56] <Apachez> instead of learning people the correct method from beginning

[03:15:33] <ajak> Joanna: i think you're missing the point, we're assuming employees have local root
[03:15:36] <Apachez> Joanna: nowadays everything is done remotely more or less

[03:16:17] <vonunov> Apachez: I seem to remember a strong wave back in the day of people telling everyone don't use pointers, they're so bad, if you use pointers you're a noob and everyone gathers on usenet to laugh at your code
[03:16:24] <vonunov> Was it a prank bro? Did we get memed on?
[03:16:38] <Apachez> never heard of that
[03:16:44] <jessicara> i never heard anyone say that
[03:16:48] <Apachez> was it a 4chan thingy? ;)
[03:17:14] <jessicara> how are you going to use c without pointers? just shove a ton of stuff on the stack and over-allocate on it like crazy/
[03:17:21] <wroathe> Another problem with the local admin rights to the workstation thing is that an attacker could then disable the workstation's firewall
[03:17:26] <jessicara> and still end up with the same iteration bugs?
[03:17:36] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.48)
[03:17:40] <Apachez> jessicara: you just throw the variables into the functions like so       function(var_a, var_b);
[03:17:51] <Apachez> but in c/c++ world that means that the variable is being copied into the function
[03:18:06] <vonunov> It was more like in the context of those proto-meme "programmer jokes/stories" -- I'm probably giving a few cases too much weight but I'll see later if I can find a good example
[03:18:09] <Apachez> and then the return is copied aswell
[03:18:19] <Apachez> so stuff gets copied everywhere unnecessary
[03:18:29] <jessicara> yes and once you run out of registers said variables get pushed on to the stack
[03:18:50] <Apachez> while with pointers you just send in the 32 or 64bit pointer to where the data actually is in ram and the function operates directly on that.. no need to move and copy data around
[03:18:53] <jessicara> for the most part it's not particularly bad though
[03:19:00] <jessicara> but probably will need a pointer eventually
[03:19:13] <wroathe> Lots to think about. Thanks for the discussion Apachez
[03:19:27] <Apachez> a good compiler might spot that and adjust your shitty coding style to a proper one behind the scenes but still

[03:25:15] <jessicara> like referencing address of plus offset tends to be slower than just operate on what is already in a register

[03:28:13] <vonunov> Apachez: It looks like uhhh, what had happened was, some people were just throwing raw pointers around for everything and causing memory management issues and it got dramatized and distilled into those programmer joke text philes like "how to shoot yourself in the foot with $lang"
[03:28:23] <jessicara> but yeah, you are right copying a pointer is faster than copying an entire object. which is what it ends up doing with non-const too large to fit in registers stuff
[03:29:27] <jessicara> makes sense but too much of this shoving everything in args is shooting the other foot instead
[03:29:49] <vonunov> And the impression I was left with was that pointers [in general] are kludgy and amateurish for some reason? And probably means that the person in question isn't a Real Programmer or they would know of something cooler to use (this was like 12-yo me trying to interpret this)

[17:31:35] <Guest15> Hi all. Dunno if you can help but (I think) I'm having an issue with Firefox and HSTS. I've set up HSTS on a local test domain and accessed the site via HTTPS. If I then try and access the same page via HTTP, Firefox loads it just fine which I expected it not to do. If I try the same in Chrome, Chrome properly redirects me to the HTTPS version. Am
[17:31:35] <Guest15> I correct in thinking the Firefox behaviour is incorrect, and if so, does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?

[18:10:07] <Guest15> ajak: Just quizzed the folks over in #firefox and it would appear that Firefox ignores HSTS headers if the domain's cert is self-signed. Thanks for the reply though :)
