[03:32:42] <Nickssen> for some reason we never learned parametrization and we are doing line and surface integrals now
[03:32:58] <Nickssen> how do we obtain this certain parametrization? https://imgur.com/a/dEK6sXU
[03:33:11] <Nickssen> it looks like some form of polar coordinates were used
[03:34:13] <Fangs> Nickssen: I think you're using circle parameterization
[03:34:16] <Fangs> is that cos and sine?
[03:34:21] <Nickssen> yes
[03:34:29] <Fangs> ("sent")
[03:34:42] <Nickssen> right sen in just sin in spanish :)
[03:34:58] <Nickssen> this would be some sort of "ellipse" polar coordinates right?
[03:35:03] <Fangs> Nickssen: you should figure out how to translate the unit circle parameterization into a parameterization for circle of different radius
[03:35:13] <Fangs> or one thats centered not at the origin
[03:35:29] <Fangs> idk, I dont like to think about too fancy of a stuff, I wouldnt know what its called
[03:35:56] <Fangs> I tend to take the attitude "I know how to parameterize the unit circle but I need to move and stretch the circle around.. anything else is too hard"
[03:36:02] <Nickssen> i mean i know we can move a circle around using h + rcos t and k + rsin t
[03:36:09] <Nickssen> but when its streched and stuff i get a bit lost
[03:37:05] <Fangs> well ok, so the normal circle equation is cos^2(t) + sin^2(t) = 1, with x = cos, y = sin
[03:37:21] <Nickssen> right
[03:37:22] <Fangs> when x = 0, you can see that you have sin^2(t) = 1

[03:39:05] <Nickssen> so i would need  2sin^2 (t) ?
[03:39:09] <Fangs> well ok naively you'd see sin^2(t) = 1 and think... hmmm maybe sin^2(t) = 4
[03:39:30] <Crash1hd> hey guys, I am working on a piece of code that the math has befuddled me. there is a spot line 165 in the gauge.component.ts file in https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-evvqzf?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.module.ts
[03:39:44] <Fangs> ah, but then when y = 0, you'd have cos^2(t) = 4.. but you want this to still be equal to 1
[03:40:08] <Fangs> so *now* you'd want 4cos^2(t) = 4 (so after dividing by 4 on both sides you'd have cos(t) = 1)
[03:40:46] <Nickssen> so 4cos^2 t  + sin^2 t = 4 does our stretching
[03:40:54] <Crash1hd> I am trying to understand why 1.666666666666667 (I brute forced my way to getting that number but was wondering if anyone could explain why its always 1.666666666666667)
[03:41:12] <Nickssen> right?
[03:41:22] <Crash1hd> its not half of PI So I am confused.
[03:42:08] <Fangs> Nickssen: yes, but thats still the 'circle equation' not necessarily the parameterization
[03:42:26] <Fangs> so you'd take that 4cos^2 t  + sin^2 t, and equate it to x^2 + y^2
[03:42:30] <Nickssen> ahhhh
[03:42:48] <Nickssen> x = 2cos t, y =sin t
[03:42:51] <Fangs> now ofc, it doesnt meant that x^2 = r cos^2(t) is the *only* solution
[03:42:59] <Fangs> but thats the 'obvious' way to do it
[03:43:01] <Fangs> well
[03:43:05] <Fangs> Nickssen: lets be careful
[03:43:12] <Fangs> this is my bad, I wasnt being careful
[03:43:18] <Fangs> 4cos^2 t  + sin^2 t = 4
[03:43:24] <Fangs>  x^2 + y^2 = 1
[03:43:40] <Fangs> 09:12 <Nickssen> x = 2cos t, y =sin t <-- this is correct up to some scaling

[04:24:09] <Crash1hd> [itchyjunk], I would just use the code in this example http://xahlee.info/js/svg_circle_arc.html but I need to be able to reverse the direction (which is how I ended up with this Frankenstein of a code.
[04:24:38] <Crash1hd> I cant understand it well enough to have the gauge negative value reverse with the toggle in the example code.
[04:27:30] <[itchyjunk]> hmm, to draw an arc what infomation do you need?
[04:27:47] <[itchyjunk]> either length of arc or angle between it or some such?
[04:27:54] <Crash1hd> basically
[04:28:03] <Crash1hd> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5737975/circle-drawing-with-svgs-arc-path/10477334#10477334
[04:28:11] <[itchyjunk]> theta = s/r is then what you use to figure those out?
[04:28:17] <Crash1hd> This was the example I found that explains how to draw an arc with 2 archs
[04:28:27] <Crash1hd> but that code does it in that first example with one.
[04:29:45] <Crash1hd> d="M cx cy m -r, 0 a r,r 0 1,0 (r * 2),0 a r,r 0 1,0 -(r * 2),0" <-- tgus us cx,cy = center x and y r is radius
[04:30:07] <Crash1hd> and I found out that the largeArc is either 0 or 1 depending on if its a shallow sweep or large sweep

[05:58:49] <frelleck> writing w = v + x it's the same as asking why <x,v> >= 0
[05:59:58] <topoi> ..that is to say: shouldn't all variables be substituted then (it's some part of a proof of Dirichlet's formula btw.)?
[06:01:06] <frelleck> the vectors x + y with <y,v> are a plane such that C is on the "far" side of this plane

[06:11:06] <johnkeats6> i was thinking: if you could start at v and walk in some direction w with <v, w> < 0, then (at least infinitesimally) your norm is bound to go down, because you can split that motion up as walking perpendicular to v + walking along v but in the contrary direction. walking perpendicular (infinitesimally) doesn't change your norm, so you ignore that

[06:11:46] <frelleck> then the line segment from p to v would be in C
[06:11:49] <johnkeats6> and walking along v but contrary clearly reduces your norm, even infinitesimally

[18:56:52] <Z-module> or more neatly packaged: Take X = the graph of tan on the interval (-pi/2, pi/2) -- this is closed in R^2. Its convex hull is the whole strip (-pi/2, pi/2) x R.  That's pretty.

[18:58:10] <int-e> oh no

[19:26:28] <rubiksdream> so we only need dom(f) compact and hausdorff, and codomain(f) compact
[19:30:16] <Z-module> ah yes. I think Munkres even has this exact statement somewhere.
[19:39:38] <evidlo> is it a straightforward application of the chain rule to find something like df(x, y, z)/dg(x, y) ?
[19:41:13] <evidlo> I don't think f can be written as a function of g
[19:41:50] <twoisprime> A person desired to reach a point that is k km from her present location and in a direction that 35.0 degrees north of east. However, she must travel along streets that go either north-south or east-west. What is the minimum distance she could travel to reach her destination?
[19:42:18] <twoisprime> Is it true that we cannot infinitely staircase towards the destination, as that would still result in walking the same distance as if we just walked east and then north?
[19:42:37] <twoisprime> My idea is that we never truly converge to the diagonal, so we can't walk 3.42 km
[19:43:12] <twoisprime> k = 3.42 in this case
[19:45:07] <rubiksdream> so the question is asking you to compute the manhattan distance of a point from the origin?
[19:45:10] <evidlo> its the same distance regardless of how many 90 degree turns she makes (assuming she doesn't overshoot)
[19:45:35] <rubiksdream> right, assuming you want the shortest distance (no overshooting in x or y), it should be |x_0| + |y_0|
[19:45:47] <rubiksdream> where (x_0,y_0) is the point k km away , at a 35 degree angle
[19:46:04] <PJBoy> https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiagonalParadox.html
[19:46:48] <twoisprime> rubiksdream: I recall there was a reason for some sort of limits not commuting
[19:47:00] <twoisprime> e.g. we are computing the diagonal with pythagoras in one and the other we are not
[19:47:05] <twoisprime> Do you know what I am talking about?
[19:47:14] <rubiksdream> yeah, but i also don't see how its related to your question
[19:47:37] <twoisprime> Because if we thought that we could walk 3.42 km by doing an infinite staircase, that would be our argument
[19:47:42] <twoisprime> (or k km)
[19:47:42] <rubiksdream> you are only allowed to travel via north-south or east-west, that restricts the metric measuring your shortest paths
[19:47:52] <rubiksdream> its the taxicab/manhattan metric
[19:49:12] <twoisprime> But if we could take 'infinitely many' steps towards the destination (i.e. infinitely many streets), then we would still have to go k km?
[19:49:20] <twoisprime> I meant more than k
[19:49:24] <rubiksdream> well even if you do an infinite staircase, add up all the heights of the vertical parts, what do you get?
[19:49:35] <rubiksdream> add up all the heights of the horizontal parts, what will you get?
[19:49:40] <mawk> if it's infinite what's the height of a vertical part?
[19:49:47] <mawk> if it has a height it's not an infinite staircase
[19:49:49] <rubiksdream> well it will be an infinite series
[19:49:55] <rubiksdream> and it will converge to something
[19:50:06] <twoisprime> So would it converge to the diagonal?
[19:50:08] <rubiksdream> its certainly bounded above by |x_0|...
[19:50:12] <rubiksdream> (the vertical sum)
[19:50:18] <rubiksdream> and the horizontal sum is bounded above by |y_0|
[19:50:24] <rubiksdream> assuming you do not overshoot during your ascent
[19:50:33] <rubiksdream> no, it would not converge to the diagonal
[19:50:46] <rubiksdream> *whoops, other way around
[19:50:58] <rubiksdream> horizontal by |x_0| and vertical by |y_0|
[19:51:19] <twoisprime> Yeah I am thinking it would still converge to |x_0| + |y_0|
[19:51:22] <twoisprime> Right?
[19:51:24] <rubiksdream> yes
[19:51:40] <mawk> but your staircase shape can get arbitrarily close to the diagonal
[19:51:46] <rubiksdream> thats true
[19:52:20] <mawk> maybe the length is not entirely appropriate as a measure
[19:52:24] <rubiksdream> which is why its called a 'paradox'
[19:52:28] <mawk> probably some fractal magic would solve it

[19:53:19] <rubiksdream> twoisprime i guess its not irrelevant, i may have spoken a little too soon, but to me it was sort of clear the answer had to be |x_0| + |y_0|, but it may be because i've seen stuff like this before
[19:53:51] <rubiksdream> basically I did the 'add up the verticals' and 'add up the horizontal' argument in my head, and figured regardless of your path, you get at least |x_0| + |y_0|
[19:54:01] <rubiksdream> and certainly there is a path with length |x_0| + |y_0|
[19:54:21] <rubiksdream> hence shortest path length is exactly |x_0| + |y_0|

[20:49:09] <recursiveNode> can you help with one thing? In JIRA, normally you add functional requirements as user stories. But every functional requirement can also have a non-functional requirement associated with it. 1 non-functional requirement can be associated with one or more user stories. One user story can have 0 or more non-functional requirements. And, there can also be a specific set of user-stories associated with the same non-functional
[20:49:09] <recursiveNode> requirements. How would you add non-functional requirements in JIRA?

[22:23:22] <mnhrdt> johnkeats6: is the formula here ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection
[22:24:53] <mnhrdt> koszul formula is the closest one, but still not that
[22:25:38] <johnkeats6> mnhrdt, using Hess(f)(X,Y) = <nabla_X grad f, Y> should do it
[22:26:15] <johnkeats6> since you allow musical isomorphism it works.
[22:26:40] <mnhrdt> aaah, that definition of the Hessian together with koszul formula, it works!
[22:27:04] <johnkeats6> yes. but it's important to remember coordinates don't have cooties
[22:27:07] <mnhrdt> there's no way I could have reached this expression by the senseless manipulation i was trying
[22:28:29] <mnhrdt> johnkeats6: i have no problem using coordinates in differential geometry.  What I'm trying to do here is to find an analogous construction to the hessian on a graph (just like the graph laplacian is analogous to laplace-beltrami on a manifold)

[23:49:18] <motle> oh right because |1+i | = 2
[23:49:29] <motle> sqrt 2*
[23:49:39] <biberao> motle: yes
[23:49:43] <biberao> but now
[23:49:47] <HisShadow> not sure you can draw it, complex plane rotated and stretched is still a complex plane, you need to restrict z
[23:49:51] <biberao> why is it 45degrees clockwise?
[23:50:04] <rubiksdream> anticlockwise
[23:50:08] <motle> HisShadow: thats my point, it still has x and y
[23:50:08] <biberao> sorry
[23:50:10] <biberao> i meant
[23:50:15] <int-e> because 1 is mapped to 1+i, just look at those two points
[23:50:16] <biberao> why is it 45degrees anticlockwise?
[23:50:19] <motle> its not like its plot y=x
[23:50:22] <biberao> HisShadow: in this case its z(1+i)>=0
[23:51:04] <motle> i think it would only make sense to say something like "plot z(i+1) for z = p(x,y) for some given polynomial
[23:51:20] <HisShadow> biberao: that makes no sense either
[23:51:37] <HisShadow> you can't impose total order on complex numbers like on reals
[23:51:41] <motle> but then can you just take "z" to mean y=x ?
[23:51:41] <int-e> biberao: real part? imaginary part? magnitude?
[23:52:07] <biberao> HisShadow:  its Re(z+iz)>0
[23:52:25] <HisShadow> that's more like it
[23:52:41] <int-e> biberao: so take z = x + iy and write the real part of (1+i)z in terms of x and y.
[23:52:50] <motle> id say more like (1+i) is an opperator, and asking for the plot is as bad as asking for the plot of z
[23:53:21] <biberao> i see
[23:53:24] <motle> plot of z=1 would be fine
[23:53:29] <biberao> sorry im so going blind
[23:54:00] <rubiksdream> you can 'draw' maps C -> C, for example by domain colouring
[23:54:05] <motle> like you cant just plot (x,y), you *can* plot p(x,y)=0 however
[23:54:22] <rubiksdream> sometimes that can actually be useful, but in practice its enough to just draw the effect of the map on some region of interest
[23:55:48] <rubiksdream> domain colouring makes for some pretty pictures though
