[00:15:41] <gwozniak> ``I’ve been fighting for this for decades. More sunshine, better health, and the end of a tired tradition.''
[00:15:55] <gwozniak> While I like the outcome, this reasoning is stupid
[00:17:15] <defect> it was approved by the senate
[00:17:19] <gwozniak> Uh, I hate to inform the person who said this, but, uh... the number hours of sunshine doesn't change, regardless of how you change the clock
[00:18:06] <Brekkjern> I fucking hate adjusting the time for that
[00:18:46] <companion_cube> the time change itself sucks, so let's just get rid of it
[00:18:52] <companion_cube> personally I'm glad about it
[00:18:57] <gwozniak> I'm totally on board for getting rid of it
[00:20:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah, same

[20:30:15] <edk> yes
[20:39:08] <epilys> kronk, haha
[20:47:33] <skyl4rk> "The sky was the color of TV, tuned to a dead channel" ...was there ever a conclusion on what this meant, I mean on an old tv with no squelch and no carrier wave it would be static ("war of the ants" in swedish), but with a carrier wave present but no image, or in som cases with a squelch there would be an almost-but-not-quite-because-the-electron-gun-is-still-running black. Then on newer
[20:47:35] <skyl4rk> systems in some cases no input is represented by brightest blue.
[20:48:27] <skyl4rk> The sky was the color of youtube, with adblock installed.
[20:53:55] <Brekkjern> What colour does YT have when you don't have Adblock installed?
[20:55:31] <skyl4rk> depends on the commercial I guess
[20:55:54] <skyl4rk> I was not preparing for any deeper analysis
[20:56:15] <ngoldbaum> skyl4rk: when it was written in the 80s it meant black and white static
[20:56:21] <Brekkjern> But that is the fun part :)
[20:56:25] <ngoldbaum> now i guess it means blue? but that is normal…
[20:56:30] <ngoldbaum> so doesn’t make much sense
[20:56:40] <ngoldbaum> really place neuromancer in time though
[20:56:55] <ngoldbaum> super high tech VR ninjas… with references to analogue TV
[20:57:39] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Watching/reading old sci fi is always really funny
[20:57:51] <Brekkjern> Unless they go with the style of Dune
[20:57:52] <ngoldbaum> also neuromancer is one of those things where everyone else subsequently copied it so now it seems really hokey
[20:58:02] <ngoldbaum> the matrix mostly is responsible for that
[20:58:12] <ngoldbaum> and in turn the matrix feels hokey now
[20:58:55] <ngoldbaum> and the new matrix movie took it upon itself to do a postmodern deconstruction of the whole genre, complete with the merovingian shouting in french about how stupid a fight scene on a bunch of scaffolding is
[21:02:46] <Church> Eh Neuromancer seems fine, still my backpack novel if I have nothing else to do
[21:02:58] <Church> Can read that thing in like an hour
[21:03:02] <skyl4rk> I don't really care about the matrix movies apart from the first. Not as in the "there is no sequel" wankery that seems popular sometimes, but more like I stayed up way to late watching it that one first time and it got into my head. I don't need the biblical allegory established in the sequels for it to mean something to me on a deeper level. On the same note I don't hate the sequels,
[21:03:04] <skyl4rk> because I don't need them to have a complete story.
[21:03:39] <Brekkjern> I tried reading Neuromancer a while back, but just couldn't finish it. I can't remember why other than it not really gripping me
[21:03:44] <skyl4rk> I've always found Gibson's writing a bit difficult to change, or used to at least, was a while since.
[21:03:49] <skyl4rk> not change
[21:03:52] <skyl4rk> follow
[21:04:35] <skyl4rk> Now my writing will be difficult to follow, if I keep changing out words like that. The perils of writing one sentence while thinking of how to formulate the next I guess...
[21:04:55] <Brekkjern> Lol
[21:05:32] <Brekkjern> Well, in comparison, I'm reading the Stormlight Archive now, and I practically can't put the book down
[21:06:27] <skyl4rk> His writing is difficult to follow for me, since he changes (that's where my misplaced "change" came from!) the scene from one sentence to the next sometimes, and I fail to pick up on it, thinking that I'm still in the context of the "old" scene.
[21:10:48] <edk> i've talked about this before but the last time i rewatched the matrix i was struck by how bad the first one was
[21:10:59] <edk> it's a bit better than the sequels, but it's not particularly amazing
[21:12:15] <Brekkjern> It's been a while since I've watched them, so I can't comment, but I always just thought the first one as a bit above average
[21:12:34] <skyl4rk> might be, I'm a bit irked about the humans to battery explanation, it's like a kessel run that is central to the worldbuilding.
[21:13:11] <edk> i don't usually mind when the excuse to have a story doesn't make logical sense, and this is no exception
[21:13:41] <skyl4rk> it's as much the idea of the matrix and the visuals, that has lived on in me as a separate thing from the movie being a good or bad movie
[21:13:52] <edk> but i thought the story wasn't particularly interesting, the dialogue was bad, and the action sequences were... archaic?
[21:15:02] <edk> like people running around in a room while bad guys fire hundreds of bullets at the floor
[21:15:07] <skyl4rk> no! they were awesome! - teenage me
[21:20:43] <gwozniak> At the time it was quite different.  I haven't watched it in a quite a while
[21:20:57] <gwozniak> I remember really enjoying it

[22:46:47] <Brekkjern> Just started the second one
[22:47:14] <Geekingfrog> have you read other works from sanderson ?
[22:47:32] <Geekingfrog> I'm a big fan of the guy, he writes good character, good worldbuilding, and he writes *a lot*, can't complain
[22:52:43] <Brekkjern> I've only read his ending of The Wheel of Time and I wasn't all that impressed, but I'd heard good things of Stormlight Archive and I wanted some fantasy, so here I am :P
[22:53:06] <Brekkjern> I'm liking it a lot. I don't think he was a good fit for Wheel of Time though
[22:55:59] <Geekingfrog> I found it fine. More action packed than the rest, but I guess that what you'd expect from the finale.
[22:57:01] <Geekingfrog> I'm easily pleased though
