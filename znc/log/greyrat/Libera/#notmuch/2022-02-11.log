[02:33:16] <bremner> acdw: you can specify tags in your Fcc header, e.g. -inbox
[02:33:36] <bremner> see variable notmuch-fcc-dirs
[02:34:17] <bremner> well. You can add tags if you use notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert=t
[02:34:56] <acdw> okay that's there... what's the Fcc header for anyway?
[02:35:09] <acdw> how's it work i guess? I have 3 email accounts, i want to make sure i set the fcc headers right
[02:36:24] <bremner> there's a kind of encyclopedic docstring for the variable
[02:36:59] <acdw> ahhh lmao, of course
[02:37:02] <acdw> i'll read that, thank you :)
[02:37:15] <acdw> i had it comment it out in my config b/c i didn't have time to look @ it, not sure what it meant

[19:54:58] <inwit> Does the post-new hook run even if there are no new messages? Afaics it shouldn't (Â«is invoked by the notmuch-new(1) command after new messages have been imported into the databaseÂ»), but, in my experience, it runs no matter what.
[20:01:23] <bremner> iirc, it runs no matter what
[20:02:16] <bremner> many people use new.tags to identify those messages found on the current run of notmuch-new
[20:05:47] *** Quits: nzeo (~nzeo@80.64.181.150) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[20:08:15] <inwit> Maybe the docs should say Â«is invoked by the notmuch-new(1) command once it has finishedÂ»? In case there are no new messages whatsoever...
[20:10:56] <bremner> a smaller change would be "after _any_ new messages"
[20:12:21] *** Quits: jao (~jao@68.235.43.173) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[20:16:08] <bremner> I don't think the doc is _wrong_ as written, but docs can always be improved.
[20:18:21] <inwit> Agreed. It's not wrong, but it can be confuse if you read it with my question in mind. :)
[20:19:06] <bremner> inwit: maybe you want to have a look at doc/man5/notmuch-hooks.rst and send a patch?
[20:20:15] <inwit> bremner: I'm on it :D
[20:20:25] <bremner> sounds good.
[20:22:35] <acdw> is the post-new hook how i can auto-tag mails?
[20:22:52] <bremner> it's one way, yup
[20:23:34] <acdw> other ways?
[20:24:06] <bremner> some people like "afew", which is a python thing that is a bit higher level.
[20:24:17] <bremner> notmuch-insert also takes tags on the command line
[20:24:54] <bremner> post-new hook is probably a good place to start, if you don't mind shell scripting
[20:25:37] <acdw> i don't! thanks :)
[20:25:48] <acdw> honestly i think the basic stuff is best, for now
[20:25:54] <bremner> makes sense
[20:28:16] <inwit> bremner: I don't know what I did wrong, but it came in 2 different messages... :(
[20:29:53] <inwit> acdw: I actually use afew inside post-new.
[20:35:50] <acdw> ooooh
[20:35:59] <acdw> okay /fine/ maybe i'll look at afew :P

[20:36:09] <acdw> i generally don't like python but for no good reason
[21:07:16] <bremner> inwit: hmm. let me see if I can smash them together
[21:14:52] <inwit> bremner: sorry about that... :(
[21:15:31] <bremner> was the first message from --compose in git-send-email? or part of the commit message?
[21:16:25] <inwit> I ran `git send-email --to notmuch@notmuchmail.org origin/master --compose` but somehow it sent two messages.
[21:16:47] <bremner> yeah. the cover letter (from --compose) is always seperate
[21:17:04] <bremner> luckily your cover letter text was OK for a detailed commit message
[21:17:22] <inwit> Oh! I see... in this case a cover letter wasn't strictly necessary, is that right?

[21:18:31] <inwit> Cool. Sorry for the noise, then.
