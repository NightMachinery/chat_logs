[12:36:32] <borodust> artchad: what kind of flowchart you think of?
[12:36:38] <borodust> there's opengl 3.3 pipeline thing
[12:38:22] <borodust> artchad: many of flowcharts go like this: https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/openGL_pipeline.png
[12:39:01] <borodust> it's crappy but fair, whatever pooped from google first ;p
[12:39:27] <borodust> damn, they misspelled Tessellation
[12:40:11] <borodust> the one at https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Rendering_Pipeline_Overview must be better ;p

[15:11:02] <artchad> oh shit
[15:11:13] <artchad> thanks for answering borodust
[15:12:52] <artchad> I thought that there might be an illustration of how to use the opengl functions to get a basic pipeline going
[15:13:05] <artchad> I'll show you what I mean, once I make such a chart myself.
[15:22:32] <artchad> for some reason the khronos website loads for me now.
[15:22:37] <artchad> that's nice
[15:26:39] <artchad> I would love to have an image which includes the gl calls and shows how to use them via a very basic example. Once such a simple foundation is build, the teacher can extend the chart with new concepts and cool features.
[15:27:43] <artchad> but I feel like many learning resources fall into the trap of trying to be mathematically correct at the cost of a simple understanding.
