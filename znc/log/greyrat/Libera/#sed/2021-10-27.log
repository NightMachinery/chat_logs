[15:55:15] <Soliton> you're matching ascii quotes but the data does not contain them.
[15:58:27] <clarkk> Soliton, could you elaborate. I don't understand
[15:58:49] <Soliton> “” != ""
[15:59:01] <clarkk> oh right, I see
[15:59:04] <clarkk> thanks
[16:00:55] <nitro_> i hate those quotes, so many problems
[16:04:33] <finnb> Trying to decide if a) sed is the right tool and b) what the regex is for this. Let's say I have a long string of variables in bash: '--foo=aaa --bar=bbb --baz=ccc' - how would you remove the flag/value pair of for example, `--bar=VAR` where VAR could be anything and in this case it is `--bar=bbb`. 
[16:05:11] <Soliton> why do you have options in a single string?
[16:05:22] <Soliton> it should be a list.
[16:06:36] <finnb> very good point ^-^
[16:06:38] <Soliton> for opt in "$@"; do case "$opt" in --bar=*) ...;; esac; ...; done
[16:07:03] * finnb rewrites the script
[16:07:21] <Soliton> argument handling is definitely not a job for sed.

[18:15:48] <lopid> \{…\}
[18:18:16] <clarkk> lopid, could you explain it, please?  Also, the help in "man sed" doesn't seem to go into detail, or give examples. Is there a better pleace I could learn about sed on my system?
[18:19:11] <Soliton> sed uses BRE by default.
[18:19:27] <Soliton> if you have GNU sed you can look at its info pages.
[18:20:04] <clarkk> I'm using the -E switch btw
[18:20:11] <lopid> https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_03
[18:20:15] <Soliton> even the manpage tells you that the syntax is: i \
[18:20:17] <Soliton> text
[18:20:22] <Soliton> though
[18:21:38] <Soliton> # sed $'/1/i\\\n---' <<< 1
[18:21:40] <shbot> Soliton: ---
[18:21:41] <shbot> Soliton: 1
[19:27:18] <clarkk> Soliton, sorry, I'm afraid I just can't get it to work.  This is what I have in my file, that I run using the -E argument    /^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}.*/i\n----------
[19:29:46] <Soliton> # echo sed $'/1/i\\\n---'
[19:29:48] <shbot> Soliton: sed /1/i\
[19:29:48] <shbot> Soliton: ---

[19:31:39] <shbot> Soliton: -----------------------------
[19:31:39] <shbot> Soliton: 2021-10-27 14:11:51 random text
[19:32:19] <Soliton> the .* in the address is useless, btw.
[19:33:00] <clarkk> what does the dollar sign at the start do?
[19:33:38] <Soliton> that's how you can write backslash escapes in bash.
[19:34:05] <Soliton> in your file you just use a literal newline.
[19:35:17] <clarkk> I'm sorry but I'm still very confused
[19:35:39] <clarkk> I literally don't know what this means... "that's how you can write backslash escapes in bash.
[19:35:39] <Soliton> i\
[19:35:42] <Soliton> test here
[19:36:09] <clarkk> I think I'd rather keep it on one line in the sed file
[19:36:20] <Soliton> # echo $'start a new line here ->\nthis is the next line'
[19:36:22] <shbot> Soliton: start a new line here ->
[19:36:23] <shbot> Soliton: this is the next line
[19:36:32] <Soliton> good god i give up.
[19:36:53] <clarkk> I'm sorry - it must be frustrating
[19:37:09] <Soliton> the syntax is literally multiple lines how do you get the idea to "I'd rather keep it on one line"...
[19:37:32] <clarkk> in the sed script, I'd rather use \n than put it on multiple lines
[19:37:51] <Soliton> and you're going to write your own sed version that cares?
[19:38:39] <Soliton> \n is a backslash and an n unless there is something interpreting that to mean a newline.
[19:38:54] <Soliton> your power of will is not going to do it.
[19:40:12] <clarkk> so bash interprets the backslash when you run it at the command line, but you can't do that when using a sed script? Is this what you mean/
[19:40:14] <clarkk> ?
[19:40:48] <Soliton> if you use the $'' syntax then it does, yes.
[19:40:57] <Soliton> a file is not bash syntax.
[19:42:48] <clarkk> ok, thanks, I understand that part

[19:55:45] <clarkk> Soliton, this is what I have. Unfortunately, the text isn't inserted http://paste.debian.net/hidden/0253fcbc/
[20:02:18] <Soliton> where do you hope that to happen?
[20:03:26] <clarkk> underneath any line that begins with a timestamp
[20:03:42] <Soliton> and how many lines are there after you delete stuff?
[20:04:08] <clarkk> just the two remaining after the Chrome and VMware lines are removed
[20:04:54] <Soliton> there are two lines i can see. both will be deleted.
[20:06:07] <Soliton> also i inserts before not after. if you want after you use a.
[20:06:21] <clarkk> I've added the output (results) to my pastebin
[20:06:24] <clarkk> http://paste.debian.net/plainh/1b89b9b0
[20:06:29] <clarkk> Sorry, I meant before
[20:06:46] <Soliton> so as you can see there is no line with a timestamp.
[20:07:37] <Soliton> if you want to do the insert before deletion then you need to put it first in your sed script.
[20:08:15] <Soliton> perhaps you actually want to replace deleted lines with ---?
[20:08:43] <clarkk> I've updated the paste again, with the expected results  http://paste.debian.net/plainh/035ff756
[20:09:14] <Soliton> how in the world do you expect that??
[20:09:52] <clarkk> I don't "expect" it - but that's what I'm hoping for.  Remember, I am not at all experienced with sed. I'm just learning
[20:09:54] <Soliton> you want to inser the dashes 3 lines above the timestamp line or what?
[20:10:32] <clarkk> I don't know what you mean - the dashed lines are on the line above the lines with the timestamps
[20:10:35] <Soliton> well, this is not particularly sed related. this is simply not what you said before.
[20:10:56] <Soliton> what???
[20:11:09] <Soliton> i don't think we speak the same language.
[20:11:15] <clarkk> I explained it the best I could. Indeed, I should have given the expected results right from the start, to avoid talking at cross purposes
[20:12:05] <clarkk> oh right
[20:12:11] <clarkk> sorry, I get what you mean.
[20:12:16] <clarkk> I'll do it again
[20:19:47] <clarkk> It seems like the problem was caused by having the following command before the command we were discussing.   /[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}/{n};s/^/      /
[20:20:06] <clarkk> So am I correct that {n} halts all processing for the current line?
