[00:03:02] <Wafficus> oh wow this is neat
[00:03:12] <Wafficus> this kind of reminds me of the tweaks I did in w3m a while back
[00:03:14] <Wafficus> neat stuff
[00:03:48] <Wafficus> ah nice, I didn't know the 'system-type-is-darwin' line. That's great. I always wanted to figure out how to tweak my Emacs config specifically for work Macbook stuff too

[00:10:50] <shrysr> also not sure if hydra needed.. iirc elfeed opened articles on the browser with the shortcut 'o' or 'O'. But i switched to newsblur and other clients and can't rem much of elfeed. 
[00:11:24] <Wafficus> no worries,  I wrote down your custom function for later possible use. For now, I'm gonna try the first line
[00:11:27] <Wafficus> but great workflow though
[00:11:46] <Wafficus> I like how you logistically thought "Ok, if its this site, use this browser. But if its another site, open up the GUI browser" good stuff
[00:13:10] <shrysr> i got tired of opening sites in eww that would not render properly.. it seemed only a bunch of them had this issue among my frequent sites, typically opened frmo mu4e. but that stuff is mostly copied/slightly re-purposed at most... standing on the shoulders of the giants of #emacs :) 
[00:13:49] <Wafficus> nice

[04:05:52] <Wafficus> based on this, I'm going to assume for Tramp config, I will just need to add in (tramp-login-args (("%h --project" (somehow make a statement to prompt the user for the project name) (overarching project) (project-cli))))

[04:25:30] <jlf> aidalgol: my experience in that area is all in hardware, where there was no cpu involved :)  but typically switching decisions are based on the first several words of the ethernet frame (destination address plus vlan tag(s)) and the ingress port.  from there a decision is made about whether to discard the frame or to relay it to which queue of which egress interface, which gets encoded as some metadata associated with that frame as it

[04:44:23] <aidalgol> You've lost me.  That *is* a CPU?
[04:44:45] <twb> It's an ABI.  Well, strictly a class of ABIs, the most common being RV64GC
[04:45:02] <twb> "RC64" is like "AArch64" or "x86_64"
[04:45:07] <twb> *RV
[04:45:12] <aidalgol> twb: Sounds like you're thinking of CPU work without hardware, not hardware work without a CPU.
[04:45:38] <twb> aidalgol: well in any case, the x86-64 instruction set isn't implemented in hardware, it's implemented in microcode.
[04:45:51] <twb> aidalgol: i.e. basically an interpreter that runs on the undocumented RISC CPU
[04:45:51] <aidalgol> right
[04:45:58] <aidalgol> Sounds like fun.
[04:46:03] <twb> aidalgol: *but* this is not normal.  This is because x86-64 is weird and stupid
[04:46:25] <twb> RV, MIPS, ARM *are* implemented in hardware
[04:46:25] <aidalgol> We're only stuck with it because Microsoft can't be arsed pushing something else, right?
[04:46:53] <aidalgol> Actually, that would probably be much, much worse, because they'd make sure to lock down the hardware like ARM devices.

[04:50:12] <twb> aidalgol: Intel have non-IP assets, so open hardware isn't inherently at odds with their business model
[04:50:30] <aidalgol> How about RISC-V?
[04:50:38] <twb> Note that ARM is now owned by Nvidia who have the same failpants
[04:50:58] <aidalgol> Did that acquisition go through?  I thought the UK government was blocking it.
[04:51:04] <twb> aidalgol: RV is royalty-free and at least open core.  The general idea is to bring back something like MIPS was
[04:52:06] <aidalgol> Right, but the IBM-compatible PC was a broader spec than just the ISA, which is what, AFAICT, no other CPU family is used with.

[05:10:47] <bpalmer> M-! lets you run a shell command, which should work for any shell function that has been loaded. However, it's possible that you define the shell function in a file that isn't read (e.g., in a config file that only log in shells read)
[05:11:29] <bpalmer> also, yeah, what do you mean by "on the current buffer"? If you're trying to pipe the buffer into it, C-x h to mark everything and then M-| as MysteriousSilver suggests is the way to go

[11:17:20] <dragestil> bpalmer: ok, I dunno. it's just impossible to debug firefox sometimes
[11:17:53] <bpalmer> there are some more complications as it interacts with the web stack, but lots more people are familiar with web technologies than are familiar with elisp, so ...

[11:18:44] <bpalmer> and, of course, the most straightforward answer to your question is that yes, because there are web browsers written in elisp and run inside of emacs
[11:19:00] <bpalmer> They're not particularly powerful web browsers. But they can be extended as easily as emacs itself.

[11:21:30] <wasamasa> lol
[11:21:37] <wasamasa> they don't execute JS, they have no need for librejs
[11:21:46] <bpalmer> w3m is properly a text-based browser that can run underneath emacs, unlike eww and w3 which are browsers inside of emacs

[11:23:28] <bpalmer> elinks is another text browser, and elinks-js adds some javascript/ecmascrdipt support

[14:33:37] <aidalgol> And the vsc emulation mode being discussed was more akin to vim emulators, to make it easier for users to transition from *to* Emacs, not for Emacs users to leverage the other editor.
[14:33:51] <johnjay> oh ok
[14:36:06] <aidalgol> The only thing novel VSCode has would be in extenions, like that "devcontainers" extension that runs your stuff in docker.

[21:15:00] <BrokenCog> arg.  this Tramp issue is strange and frustrating.  I was getting this "Waiting for prompts from remote shell ..." timeout.  tried removing .emacs startup config, .emacs.d.  Finally uninstalled/removed everything and reinstalled.  Then it worked.  At least ... it opened a file once and I could edit for a time.  that was yesterday, today it won't connect again.  literally nothing changed.
