[01:54:32] <joepie91> don't drive while exhausted
[01:54:39] <joepie91> because yes, sleep deprivation is more or less analogous to being drunk
[01:54:58] <joepie91> (this is why revspace has rules against sleep deprivation, actually)
[01:56:03] <ThePendulum> ouch, yeah, it has gotten me by surprise before, but I definitely try to avoid that as much as drink and drive
[01:56:50] <joepie91> same applies for powertools btw
[01:56:57] <joepie91> do not operate powertools while either drunk or sleep-deprived
[01:57:16] <ThePendulum> and heavy machinery
[01:57:36] <joepie91> generally speaking, just do not operate anything that has a motor of some kind that runs independently from your direct input
[01:58:12] <joepie91> (assisted e-bikes are fine, self-propelling ones are not, for example)
[01:58:42] <ThePendulum> yeah anything where the worst case is more than a minor inconvenience
[01:59:49] <joepie91> right, the reason I mention 'independent motors' is because they will continue operating regardless of whether you are paying attention to them
[01:59:57] <joepie91> they will not respond to you falling over, not noticing something, etc.
[02:00:29] <joepie91> if you fall asleep on a regular bike, you fall over. if you fall asleep on an independently-propelled e-bike, however...
[02:00:46] <ThePendulum> mate of my dad's fell over while riding a bike drunk and they had to tell him to stop pedaling

[22:15:06] <evilgohan2> moo: Rack prices are absolutely insane.
[22:15:21] <evilgohan2> I'm trying to find a solution to rack some MFF machines (think the size of Mac Minis).
[22:15:40] <evilgohan2> I have about 10 or 11 I wanna rack.
[22:15:57] <evilgohan2> First, trying to find a rack is not great right now - especially for a reasonable price for an individual
[22:16:16] <evilgohan2> second, the shelves that are fabricated to hold these things are like $300
[22:16:20] <evilgohan2> per shelf.
[22:16:24] <evilgohan2> and they only fit two each.
[22:16:45] <evilgohan2> At this point, I might as well see if I can find someone competent in CAD and 3D print one.
[22:21:06] <evilgohan2> Wouldn't mind doing something like this though: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/oi1f1i/m75q2_tiny_based_home_cluster/
[22:21:16] <evilgohan2> but that rack is a custom job by the looks of it
[22:23:46] <Allie> evilgohan2: racksolutions are the company to go for
[22:24:32] <Allie> we have a bunch of their stuff, it's all real good

[22:25:55] <Allie> https://www.racksolutions.co.uk/hypershelf-for-dell-optiplex-sliding-shelf.html or uh, 16 optiplexes
[22:28:28] <evilgohan2> Allie: I think I saw somthing like that, but it was out of stock and also EU only. (I'm in NA)
[22:28:43] <evilgohan2> but yeah, this would be to fit MFF Optiplex's
[22:28:43] <Allie> racksolutions cover the US
[22:28:46] <evilgohan2> :o
[22:28:53] <unfinity> ・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\_ø​< q​uack!

[22:28:55] <unfinity> Allie you befriended a duck in 2.341 seconds! You have made friends with 10 ducks in #datahoarder.
[22:29:00] <Allie> they're not super expensive for what they are
[22:29:17] <evilgohan2> expensive is a relative term ;)
[22:29:26] <evilgohan2> 523 quid comes out to...
[22:29:32] <Allie> well if you have sixteen optiplex micros you can afford the cost of one extra optiplex micro
[22:29:34] <evilgohan2> ,wa 523.20 gbp to usd

[22:29:42] <evilgohan2> lol, all of these were free to me
[22:29:50] <evilgohan2> came from old company.
[22:30:02] <Allie> you want racksolutions.com i think
[22:30:11] <evilgohan2> guess that's something to save for then.
[22:30:16] <evilgohan2> Add it to the list of items.
[22:30:22] <evilgohan2> Roof currently takes priority over all.
[22:30:24] <Allie> otherwise - big fuckin pile. :P 
[22:30:34] <Allie> yeah, 599USD

[22:31:12] <evilgohan2> lol. Seriously, though, they're retired machines from my old company. As people got cycled out, they cycled out these machines - especially once the pandemic hit and people started working remotely.
[22:31:25] <evilgohan2> so they were sitting in inventory, so... f it. Grabbed 'em.
[22:32:14] <evilgohan2> https://www.racksolutions.com/hypershelf-for-dell-optiplex-sliding-shelf.html Hmm... yeah, this can work. Add to the list of items, but - like I said - the roof comes first. 
[22:36:21] <evilgohan2> thx for this

[23:21:23] <moo> evilgohan2 i actually purchased a bunch of rack face plates to "rack" some of small appliances i have. angle grinder and drill will make it easy to fabricate holders for like raspberry pi, isp modem etc :D
