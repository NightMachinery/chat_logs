[08:22:50] <technomancy> we're still on 8 at work
[08:33:19] <sobel> correction: it was the advent of TLS 1.3 that required i get to jdk11. 8 only supported 1.1 and 1.2, IIRC.

[20:40:52] <sobel> the advantage for me was being able to establish client TLS connections to servers that would only use TLS 1.3
[20:41:28] <ridcully> i had no problems either going from 8 to 11.  so i just switched.  at least its no PITA like keeping up with $JAVASCRIPT_FRAMEWORK
[20:42:01] <sobel> i am pretty sure jdk8 supported all the lambda syntax i use with vertx
[20:42:39] <sobel> all my clojure code seemed to Just Work on jdk11, too
[20:43:02] <ridcully> i have three projects or so remaining (and stuck) at 8 (non clojure).  one even runs on 11 due to ops persons updating systems
[20:43:41] <sobel> i have one quite stuck on 1.4
[20:43:52] <sobel> and windows via jni+dll
[20:44:34] <ridcully> you win ;)
[20:44:49] <sobel> hahahaha, my legacy woes could sink a ship
[20:45:00] <ridcully> and i thought i had it bad
[20:45:00] <sobel> with any luck we're severing that part of the business this year
[20:46:44] <sobel> ex: 4 times a year, we create new tables. each table has the year/month encoded in it, and holds exactly one row per entity. (we store public data on banks)
[20:47:16] <sobel> so each app has to calculate the table(s) and JOINs based on date ranges it wants.
[20:48:03] <sobel> prior arsonists (my affectionate term for the jokers who built this heap) couldn't be bothered with a simple date column.
[20:49:14] <sobel> when i got there, the remaining firestarter had a script regime that was copying entire schemas to the same dated pattern every quarter. so each incremental schema had history + 1 new quarter.
[20:49:53] <sobel> me, a naive new firefighter: i'm very good at SQLing all the things, i'll just install postgresql and get started
[20:51:22] <sobel> i understand cutting corners because you're in a hurry but this is ridiculous.

[22:51:25] <sobel> the php/js frontend/middleware is just as much deplorable code
[22:51:45] <sobel> the epitome of things that break just because browsers get better
[22:52:26] <sobel> the posgresql/clojure/java/react stuff i've put in since then has been pretty sweet. good tools have made me look real good, there.
[22:52:51] <sobel> this audience responds very well to a few treemap charts
