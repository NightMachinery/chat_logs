[01:19:29] <CaCode> https://pastebin.com/fFd6mr8p for some reason i cannot cast to int in my hacker rank problem 
[01:20:18] <CaCode> the sum accumulates the actual asci vallues of the chars instead of their integer values, which i assume should happen if you cast a char to in
[01:20:20] <CaCode> int
[01:20:28] <CaCode> Where did I go so wrong?
[01:26:50] <Raziel> I am confused. that looks like it tries to do a lot more than just that. and what's a REP()?
[01:27:30] <CaCode> sorry it REP is a macro for(int i = a; i < b; i++)
[01:28:35] <CaCode> I somehow can't cast the values of n[i] to int 
[01:29:03] <CaCode> if i am not mistake a string is a char array, but this just takes the ascii values of the numbers and ends up with the wrong reuslt
[01:29:31] <CaCode> say '1' is treated like 49 instead of the integer 9
[01:29:40] <CaCode> i mean the int 1
[01:32:34] <Raziel> <CaCode> sorry it REP is a macro for(int i = a; i < b; i++)
[01:32:38] <Raziel> ...why
[01:32:44] <CaCode> ok never mind that please
[01:33:00] <CaCode> what is wrong with my cast from string element to integer?
[01:33:36] <Raziel> and yes, a string is a char array, underlying.
[01:33:39] <Raziel> what results do you get?
[01:34:13] <CaCode> the cast to int doesnt happen, instead of '1' being cast to the integer 1 it remains it's ascii value 49 
[01:34:21] <CaCode> where did i go so wrong?
[01:35:23] <osse> that's what casting does
[01:35:34] <Raziel> I thought you *wanted* their ascii values
[01:35:46] <Raziel> you want to parse it as an int instead?
[01:35:52] <osse> that's the point of it. take some data of one type and interpret it as if it was another type
[01:36:19] <CaCode> no i wanted to cast the char which is a number corresponding to the ascii value of 1 namely 49 to be cast to an integer which is literaly the number 1
[01:36:35] <CaCode> chars are stored as numbers
[01:36:55] <CaCode> and the char '1' is literally 49, but i want to cast it to an integer 1
[01:37:07] <CaCode> not sure I am communicating effectively
[01:38:02] *** Joins: markong (~kvirc@213.146.188.203)
[01:38:11] <osse> CaCode: we understand what you want to do. But you call it casting and that's not the usual name for it
[01:38:48] <osse> so when you look up how to cast stuff you don't get the result you want
[01:39:41] <cbreak> << ('5' - '0')
[01:39:41] <geordi> 5
[01:42:00] <Raziel> CaCode, https://wandbox.org/permlink/NVqTreYIcYYJqxBw
[01:42:46] <CaCode> Thanks Raziel 
[01:43:54] <Raziel> outputCharsAsciiValue uses a cast. outputCharsParsedToInt does not, it uses stoi which is a parsing function, and which, as you can see, can fail if the thing you give it can't really be parsed to a number

[01:45:51] <Raziel> but for single digits you could also just do ascii maths like cbreak showed
[01:47:47] <CaCode> oh ok I will do that but I still have some things to figure out it seems
[01:47:51] <CaCode> sigh
[01:48:19] <CaCode> Thanks everybody :D
[01:49:31] <CaCode> so i just use std::stoi(&mychararray[0]); or ('1' - '0'
[01:49:41] <CaCode> this ascii math is ingenious by the way!
[01:50:03] <Raziel> std::stoi will choke without \0
[01:50:08] <Raziel> you can't use it on single chars

[01:51:50] <Raziel> also if it's a char array rather than a std::string, you should use atoi instead of stoi
[01:51:53] <Raziel> but yeah
[01:53:33] <CaCode> i tried adding the '\n' manually whcih didnt work out but the ascii math worked perfectly!
[01:53:40] <CaCode> thanks again, i am much obliged!
[01:53:42] <Raziel> \0 not \n
[01:53:53] <Raziel> this is what std::string cStr(1, c); does in my example
[01:53:53] <CaCode> sorry mistyped
[01:53:55] <Raziel> where c is the char
[01:53:56] <Raziel> :p
[01:54:07] <CaCode> i still had \n in my minds buffer
[01:54:09] <Raziel> just turns it from one char into a proper std::string
[01:54:11] <CaCode> should of flushed

[16:22:40] <Cheaterman> Bliblibli buddiez I hope everyone's doing goodie
[16:22:52] <Cheaterman> I did a big rule of three boo-boo and now my program is full of undefined behavior
[16:23:41] <Cheaterman> Aside from the obvious ones that I can see and fix (and we'll get to that... I'd rather have some extra opinions on my fixes), which kind of tool would be most appropriate to detect them?
[16:23:47] <Cheaterman> Valgrind, ASAN? Both? Neither?
[16:24:08] <Cheaterman> Thanks in advance :-)
[16:24:45] <Cheaterman> https://github.com/habecker/PySAMP/blob/main/src/pysamp/timer.h#L21 this being the boo-boo (at least half of it)
[16:24:52] <Cheaterman> https://github.com/habecker/PySAMP/blob/main/src/pysamp/timer.cpp#L25
[16:25:09] <Cheaterman> and this being the reason the boo-boo is a boo-boo... I'm doing Python refcounting in constructor/destructor and putting those objects in a deque
[16:25:38] <Cheaterman> so I probably need copy constructor and copy assignment to be defined with the appropriate refcounting ops

[21:17:12] <Alipha> Probably would very rarely be important, but you could make operator* much more efficient (using `log n` concatenations instead of n concatenations). Also, it's UB to overload operators for std types unless one of the operands is a user-defined type

[22:09:16] <Alipha> TingPing: you can use ranges in c++20. I'm not terribly familiar with ranges, but maybe PJBoy would give an example ;-)
[22:09:51] <PJBoy> ranges so far can't produce a new container
[22:09:57] <TingPing> I am targeting C++17 atm also :/
[22:09:58] <PJBoy> expecting to see something for that in C++23
[22:10:10] <Alipha> :-o lame
[22:10:19] <PJBoy> but you can do std::transform with back_inserter
[22:10:47] <PJBoy> or std::transform with pre-sized target vector
[22:11:17] <Alipha> It looks like TingPing wants a copy_if in there too, which means an intermediary container, which is lame
[22:11:39] <Alipha> I'd just do a for loop and push_back
[22:11:55] <TingPing> alright. std::back_inserter is neat though
[22:12:03] <PJBoy> yeah there's no transform_if type algorithm
[22:13:55] <PJBoy> although C++20 ranges have a solution for that
[22:13:57] <PJBoy> I think
[22:14:33] <TingPing> know any good presentations or anything over ranges?
