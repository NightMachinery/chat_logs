[04:30:33] <bl1nk> eliocamp: I need some more context here I guess. If you're talking about installing using yarn you can install from a local folder using yarn add file:path/to/thelounge

[04:32:36] <eliocamp> thelounge install can install a theme or a package. You can install theme-thelounge-amoled, for instance with thelounge install theme-thelounge-amoled. It will search the package on npmjs and install it. 
[04:33:08] <eliocamp> But if I have a package or theme locally on a folder. Is it possible to install it with thelounge install?
[04:35:55] <eliocamp> (I installed thelounge via .deb=
[04:38:56] <bl1nk> eliocamp: Same applies, you can use file:path/to/package to install from local folders as well
[04:39:25] <bl1nk> At least judging by https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/master/src/command-line/install.js#L29

[04:55:42] <bl1nk> Oh sorry, that's just because I did not install thelounge globally here so I have to run the CLI with node index instead of thelounge. It's effectively the same command you are running
[05:01:22] <eliocamp> Huh. Perhaps there's something wrong with my package.json, then? It works when copied manually into the relevant folder, though. I'll try it with a valid plugin.
