[00:00:25] <CarloWood> When N gets larger - it becomes more and more likely to find a pair that has more bits that are the same.  In particular when N is much larger than 2^64 - the expectation value for the number of equal bits will be 64.

[00:08:00] <acd> yes
[00:08:08] <acd> it's just 64 bits
[00:08:27] <CarloWood> Generate N of those - pure random numbers. Every bit 50% for 0 or 1 and no correlations.
[00:08:38] <acd> ok
[00:08:52] <CarloWood> Now you compare number 1 and number 2 and count how many bits are the same.
[00:09:12] <CarloWood> The expectation value of the number of bits that are the same is 32, ok?
[00:09:30] <acd> So you're asking how many times the nth bit in number 1 is the same as the nth bit in the second number?
[00:09:40] <CarloWood> yes

[00:31:28] <CarloWood> In order to actually calculate the expectation value, you'd have to find a formula for the chance that exactly M bits are the maximum number of bits that are equal in one of the pairs of numbers.
[00:33:12] <CarloWood> And that, I suppose is equal to  "all possibly permutations of N numbers that have a max. of M bits equal" / "all possible permutations of N numbers"
[00:33:18] <CarloWood> Does that seem correct?

[00:40:01] <joel135> there is an analogous continuous problem: given N vectors uniformly sampled in the hypercube [0, 1]^64, what is the expected minimum distance between them?
[00:40:33] <CarloWood> Yes, that seems the same problem.
[00:40:41] <joel135> i don't think it is any easier though..
[00:41:02] <Decker> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Approximations  e^x = 1+x;  e^1/2^32
[00:41:12] <Decker>   e^k/2^32
[00:41:20] <joel135> you could also take N samples from a single multivariate gaussian
[00:42:04] <CarloWood> The problem with the birthday problem is that it is about *equal* pairs - while here we still expect that to be 0 - yet, there *is* a minimum distance of course.
[00:45:00] <Decker> the avg distance is 1/2 :)  seems almost to be instead of e^x e^1/x  which is the probably you're outside instead  on
[00:46:03] <CarloWood> In terms of the analogous problem with the N vectors - the average distance is certainly not 1/2 :p.
[00:46:13] <Decker> no just for 2
[00:46:33] <CarloWood> Also not
[00:46:43] <Decker> but really the avg gaussian distribution should be 1/2 of the way away
[00:47:19] <Decker> but if there's not a curve and it really is flat than it's just a sum of an area of N(n-1) again
[00:47:34] <Decker> and 1/area
[00:48:01] <joel135> here's another train of thought
[00:48:25] <CarloWood> distance({0,0}, {0,0}) = 0; distance({0,0}, {0,1})=sqrt(0.5); distance(..whatever).  Add them up and divide by integer = rational integer containing sqrt(2), I think :/

[05:01:56] <jbis> How would one show this is true?
[05:03:10] <Z-module> Just write down some injection Z^+ -> (0,1)
[05:03:12] <Z-module> it's quite easy
[05:03:41] <jbis> Ah
[05:03:45] <Z-module> For cardinalities:   |A| <= |B|   means   |B| >= |A|    means   some injection A -> B  exists
[05:04:18] <jbis> I'm not sure the formal way to say it, but i'd say move the decimal all the way over. 0.1111 -> 1111
[05:04:19] <Z-module> actually |(0,1)| is strictly > |Z^+|,  but that's not your problem here
[05:04:32] <Z-module> It's easier than that
[05:04:40] <jbis> Oh
[05:04:41] <Z-module> you can make the map take only rational values
[05:05:28] <jbis> wdym?
[05:06:26] *** Joins: junebug (~junebug@2600:1700:3db0:2540:1343:907e:aefa:48d6)
[05:06:38] <Z-module> You need to just define some function f, on each positive integer n, so that each f(n) is some number in (0,1), such that each value is taken only once.
[05:06:59] <Z-module> You can use just rationals for those values.
[05:07:02] <Z-module> to make it simple
[05:07:35] <Z-module> though you don't have to
[05:07:50] <jbis> 1/n, but there's issues with that
[05:08:02] <Z-module> only one n has an issue, and you can fix it
[05:08:27] <jbis> 1/(n+1)
[05:08:31] <Z-module> there you go
[05:08:51] <Z-module> yes, f(n) = 1/(n+1)  is in (0,1) for each positive integer n, and it never repeats values.
[05:08:58] <Z-module> So you're done.
[05:10:00] <jbis> thank you
[05:10:27] <jbis> Out of curiosity how do we know  |(0,1)| > |Z^+|
[05:10:31] <Z-module> It never repeats because:  1/(n+1) = 1/(m+1) => n+1 = m+1 => n = m
[05:10:35] <junebug> Is multiple linear regression the same as single variable linear regression? Do i just need to calculate the slope for every additional variable? The formula for linear regression is y = a + bx. Would multiple linear regression just be y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... bnxn where b is the slope of the corresponding x variable?
[05:11:05] <Z-module> jbis, look up the classic Cantor diagonalization argument
[05:11:27] <Z-module> by the way,  |A| > |B|  means:  an injection B -> A  exists but none A -> B  exists
[05:11:50] <junebug> Does the intercept need to be calculated for every additional variable as well?
[05:13:38] <jbis> Thank you

[05:24:25] *** Quits: trbp (~trbp@user/trbp) ()
[05:26:27] <greenbagels> junebug: just like any of the other coefficients; the article describes how you can take one of the "x" parameters and just fix it to be 1, which turns that coefficient into the intercept
[05:28:35] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:28:47] <junebug> greenbagels, honestly the math and symbols in the article are beyond my level of understanding. I am able to calculate a simple linear regression. A model with 1 feature and 1 output. I think I understand that for a multiple linear regression model I need to calculate all the slopes for each feature. Simple enough. But the intercept still eludes me. Do I only need to use 1 feature to calculate the intercept or does this model
[05:28:47] <junebug> require multiple features to calculate it?
[05:29:39] <greenbagels> you can try to geometrically view this problem
[05:29:54] <greenbagels> for single linear regression, its fitting a line in a plane
[05:30:08] <junebug> Right
[05:30:18] <greenbagels> for linear regression with two non-constant variables, it's fitting a plane in a 3d space
[05:30:44] <junebug> The y intercept would stay in the same place no matter how many features right?

[08:16:15] <Henry151> hey guys. I'm studying trying to understand bitcoin mining algorithms a bit better.
[08:16:37] <Henry151> I am trying guesses for the correct nonce on this example page: https://dplusplus.me/mining.html?003FF000000404CB000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000?angel336
[08:16:46] <blueberrycrop> I thought it was too late to ride the bitcoin wave.
[08:17:09] <Henry151> blueberrycrop: lol that's another conversation, but i of course disagree, and think it is in infancy still
[08:17:13] <Henry151> anyway
[08:17:17] <Henry151> my conceptual question is:
[08:17:58] <Henry151> would it be more effective to try random nonces between 0 and 4294967295, or to try them sequentially starting either with 0 and going up, or with 4294967295 going down?

[08:22:05] <Henry151> no, it is to better grasp how bitcoin mining works
[08:22:31] <Galois> might be better to try something like https://dplusplus.me/mining.html?8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 where your chance of success is exactly 50%
[08:23:26] <Henry151> so in that example, every other nonce between 0 and 4xxxxx is a correct one?
[08:23:47] <Henry151> or no, just half of them are correct, but their distribution is random
[08:23:55] <Galois> I literally said to try it. If you did so then your questions would be easily answered.
[08:24:06] <Henry151> thanks Galois
[08:24:21] <Henry151> just thinking out loud :)
[08:26:27] <Galois> 80000000.... is 50%. 40000000.... is 25%. 20000000.... is 12.5%. 10000000.... is 6.25%. 08000000.... is 3.125%. etc.
[08:27:10] <Galois> the real question is, what happens when your chance of success drops below 1/4294967295 ?
[08:30:02] <Henry151> that would mean there is no correct nonce between 1 and 42xxxx, right?
[08:30:26] <Galois> incorrect. Think.
[08:31:05] <Henry151> sorry, i'm home-schooled, so i don't even have high-school algebra to help me understand stuff. But I'm thinking hard as I can.
[08:31:33] <Galois> ok, replace 4294967295 with 10 if you prefer
[08:32:11] <Henry151> ok, that helps. So if there are fewer than 1 correct nonce between 0 and 10, doesn't that translate to "there are no correct nonces between 0 and 10"?

[08:33:43] <Henry151> ah -- this is why the strategy should include a "must not try the same number twice" rule, somehow
[08:34:18] <Galois> you're still not correct but closer. May I suggest learning more math? Cryptocurrency inherently involves math. It seems silly to try to approach it without high school algebra.
[08:34:45] <Henry151> yeah i have some highschool algebra it's just that i had to teach it to myself at home on the computer
[08:34:45] <Galois> I mean we teach high school algebra for a reason. It's not just an artificial barrier to entry.
[08:35:10] <Henry151> in fact i think i've got better than that :) but you're definitely helping me think about the question
[08:35:40] <Galois> the point is you need basic concepts of probability. Like what happens if you attempt n times something which has a 1/m chance of happening.
[08:35:48] <Henry151> so i guess i am not trying to ask "is it better to roll a die ten times, or to try numbers in order from 0 to 10", i am trying to ask "is it better to try 0 through 10 in order, or to try a shuffled set of the numbers between 0 and 10"
[08:36:28] <Galois> why don't you set the difficulty at 3.125% = 1/32 and pretend that the upper limit is 32 instead of 4294967295
[08:37:00] *** Joins: Xedtr (~Xedtr@185.97.201.104)
[08:37:06] <Galois> the point is, you have the resources and access to the methods that will answer these questions
[08:38:01] <Galois> then when you're done with that, set the difficulty to 1/64 (while still pretending that the upper limit is 32)
[08:40:52] <Henry151> i will probably do that just to try and grasp what you're trying to communicate to me. But I have this gut feeling that a lot of people already have the definitive answer to the question, and it strikes me as the sort of thing that I would know just as much if I was told the answer, as I would if i went through the process of finding the answer myself. Maybe I'm wrong?
[08:41:33] <Galois> if you were told the answer, then you would know that answer just as well, but you would perpetuate a lifetime of always asking others for the answer whenever you are stuck. This is not a good life.
[08:43:36] <Henry151> Well, good point. You've already helped me to more clearly state my question, so your input has been very valuable, thank you.
[08:44:35] <Henry151> Not asking you to answer the question now -- but, I'm going to re-state the question as clearly as i can with the insight you've just provided:
[08:45:50] <Henry151> "If there are 5 correct answers between 0 and 10, randomly distributed, is it more effective to try first 0, then 1, sequentially up to 10, or to shuffle the numbers 0 through 10 and then try guesses in that new shuffled set?"
[08:46:35] <Henry151> and my gut instinct guess: The two approaches are equally effective and will on average find a correct answer in the same number of attempts.
[08:47:59] <Galois> That is not quite the correct question. The correct question is: "Suppose, for each number between 0 and 10, I flip a coin, and designate the number as correct if the coin comes up heads and incorrect if the coin comes up tails, without telling you which numbers are correct or incorrect. You can test each number for correctness one at a time. Is it more effective to test sequentially or in shuffled order?"
[08:52:15] <Henry151> i'm thinking about that right now but at a first glance i thought it looked incorrect.. see, for each number between 0 and 10, either it is correct or it is incorrect already, before i start guessing. And it looks like the way you've phrased the question, you're saying that designating it as correct or incorrect is part of the process. So that's confusing me.
[08:53:20] <Galois> The way I do it, it is not guaranteed that there are exactly 5 correct numbers.

[08:54:55] <Henry151> ok. So i thought my question was assuming that the numbers have already been designated, what is the most effective method for guessing a correct one, sequential guesses or random guesses
[08:55:33] <Galois> you are still missing the critical point. The critical point is that the number of correct designations is not necessarily exactly 50%.
[08:55:36] <Henry151> re-reading your question i see it does make sense as you stated it.
[08:55:47] <Galois> If I flip a coin 5000 times, it is very unlikely that I will get exactly 2500 heads
[08:56:02] <Galois> this is so even though the coin may be exactly fair
[08:58:04] <Henry151> i grasp what you're saying there, I think. However, I don't see how/why that has bearing on whether the sequential guessing strategy would be more effective or the random guessing strategy would be more effective.
[08:58:53] <Galois> it has no bearing on the answer to your question, but it makes a HUGE difference when the probability of correctness is less than 1/4294967295
[08:59:00] <Henry151> whether there are 5 correct answers between 0 and 10, or 2 correct answers between 0 and 10, i would think that the answer to "which strategy will be more effective for guessing a corrrect answer" would still be either sequential or random guesses
[08:59:48] <Henry151> Galois: looking at the 0 through 10, so that it can fit in my head, can you help me understand what "the probability of correctness is less than 1/10" would mean?

(Note: probability of correctness is 1/20, less than 1/10.) You can test each number one by one for correctness. What do you do?
[09:02:06] <Galois> Your version of the question would have been: "Suppose no numbers between 0 and 10 are correct. What do you do?"
[09:02:19] <Galois> The correct answer to your question is: Give up.
[09:02:21] <Henry151> ok, i grasp what you're saying now
[09:02:27] <Galois> The correct answer to my question is not: Give up.
[09:03:07] <Henry151> so the question still remains, do i try 0 through 10 in order, or do i shuffle 0 through 10 and then try them in that new random shuffled order

[09:04:04] <Galois> Your larger question is you want to understand bitcoin mining.
[09:04:20] <Galois> Well, there's a huge difference between "Give up" and "Don't give up"
[09:04:26] <Henry151> sure is :)
[09:05:53] <Henry151> a digression: my understanding of math is really weird, because of how i learned. I was home-schooled, and my parents never made me finish memorizing my multiplication tables, but my dad read stories from GEB by Douglas Hofstadter to us starting when we were small children. I read it myself for the first time at 13 and have read it three times since. So I am still lacking in some fundamentals, but I have
[09:05:59] <Henry151> a pretty good understanding of some higher-level concepts.
[09:06:25] <Galois> sorry, you have a superficial understanding of some higher-level concepts. Without fundamentals you have no foundation for true understanding.
[09:06:40] <Henry151> i think that i have a pretty good understanding of how bitcoin mining works, compared to most people. But I am trying to dig a little deeper and understand more specifically, what strategy is best for guessing the correct nonce.
[09:07:26] <Galois> you don't necessarily need multiplication tables, although I do advocate learning them, but you do need fundamentals of algebra and probability, for life in general, not just for math
[09:07:36] <Henry151> this line of inquiry has led me to the very specific question that i am digging towards. And I really appreciate the input you've provided already and am all ears to any further help, but I still feel like I am failing to connect your inputs to my understanding of the question.
[09:07:58] <Galois> My suggestion is the same as from an hour ago. Learn more math.
[09:08:05] <Galois> This is not a quick or easy process. Sorry.
[09:08:37] <Henry151> nice :) I'm taking a statistics course (on my own, by just reading the college course book and doing the exercises) and also taking a computer science class that is teaching me more math

You can't simulate in your own mind the unknown thought process of an opponent.

If I am able to shuffle the order, and then start at the same moment as you, and we go the same speed -- now i might win, if my shuffle was "lucky" and put my first correct answer closer to the

[09:37:24] <Henry151> yeah Ara in #bitcoin just dropped me some more understanding; apparently the simulation i was looking at uses a set "merkle root hash" that is the same for all participants in the "race". However, in reality, each miner has a unique merkle root hash, and so we're all racing, but not all looking at the same set of numbers -- we each *do* flip that coin for each number in the set first to assign it as
[09:37:30] <Henry151> correct or incorrect (by creating a unique merkle root hash first, and including that before the nonce for our final hash)

[11:19:55] <PlanckWalk> Sounds ridiculous bureaucratic nonsense.

[11:21:20] <kamil> for example you attended math lectures
[11:21:34] <PlanckWalk> Provide documentation that you attended them!
[11:21:43] <kamil> but yes sounds bureaucratic

[11:22:04] <PlanckWalk> Not just documented, but *well* documented!
[11:22:08] <kamil> with lecturer
[11:22:19] <PlanckWalk> That's like more than total!
[11:22:34] <PlanckWalk> As a well-order is a more stringent property than just a total order.
[11:22:54] <PlanckWalk> Well documented must be more stringently documented than totally documented.

[18:25:51] <CloudEvil> kongsheng: If you can do arbitrary computations on it, then it's turing complete.
[18:26:04] <CloudEvil> If you can simulate a turing tape machine on it, more specificially.
[18:27:06] <kongsheng> Cool. So how would I build a circuit that's not fully turing complete? It's JUST a finite state machine or pushdown automoton?
[18:27:37] <kongsheng> I can simulate a full computer, but I want to build just enough computer to have finite states.
[18:28:04] <CloudEvil> Technically, turing requires an infinite tape. In practice, this is less of a useful requirement.
[18:28:47] <CloudEvil> For it to be not turing complete, it basically needs to have no internal storage, and the outputs are simply a function of the inputs at any given time.
[18:29:40] <CloudEvil> (Or for it to have limited behaviour in a way that you can't do specific aspects of the turing machine.
[18:30:55] <kongsheng> Ok. I guess I am confused about the necessity of memory in an FSM and the way a machine switches state like the model does. I just don't know who/what to read to fill the gaps in my understanding. I have a copy of Sipser's Introduction to the Theory of Computation.

[18:32:22] <kongsheng> Because I don't think that combinational logic is enough to build a FSM, but with enough sequential power, (and I might be wrong) a machine approximates turing completeness at some point.
[18:32:44] <kongsheng> And I may be wrong about all of this because I have not really built beyond the full adder.

[20:35:07] <isekaijin> I think a good measure of nonconvexity should be “extensive” in this sense. So, you rescale your subset of R^n, and the measured value scales correspondingly.\

[22:32:35] <blei> if it runs on a CPU then it must be a linear combination

[22:40:22] <z6np-6w> isekaijin, the mono-digital system is a bit absurd, but arbitray sets of zeros linked together can add up into something as I'm seeing it. This channel is amazing btw, sorry to chirp in with my abstract questions and hypothesis :D
[22:42:54] <isekaijin> How do you plan to construct a space homeomorphic to the Cantor set, using an alphabet of just one symbol, and using “natural” constructions (e.g., “space of finite lists of one symbol”, which is just the natural numbers, or “space of sequences of one symbol”, which is a one-point space)?

[22:45:33] <z6np-6w> they were unrelated, how do you map any finite space to a cantor set using any finite alphabet is the hard one

[22:50:37] <z6np-6w> it's fairly easy to visualize something 3/4 into N0 plus 2, but expressing that brings in hyperreals and algorithms
