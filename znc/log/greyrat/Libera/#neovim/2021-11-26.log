[15:57:00] <NicolasHillegeer> My solution, since before single-file-support, is to just return "/" as the root. Works great.

[16:00:12] <NicolasHillegeer> A question: I have a setup where I want to load gopls for Go-files outside of a certain directory and some-other-lsp for Go-files inside of a certain directory.
[16:01:48] <NicolasHillegeer> I've made this work, by overriding the `on_new_config` in the `config` table: setting `config.enabled = false` for gopls and `config.enabled = true` on the other LSP server
[16:02:22] <NicolasHillegeer> This has the unfortunate side effect of still printing `Autostart for gopls failed: matching root directory not detected.` at every load of a Go file inside the special folder
[16:04:08] <NicolasHillegeer> (I've mentioned the `on_new_config` approach on https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/1385, because I think `single_file_support` broke my old approach of overriding `root_dir`.)

[16:05:12] <NicolasHillegeer> I can probably hack around and remove this annoying `Autostart for gopls failed: matching root directory not detected.` message, but what's the canonical way to do this?
[16:06:53] <NicolasHillegeer> Of note, the same happens when I open a Go file that's not in a .git directory and doesn't have go.mod/go.work in any parent. Annoying spam.

[16:09:12] <clason[m]> PSA: LSP works with _projects_, first and foremost. Single-file (aka `root_directory = null`) is a later addition to the spec which not all servers support (and of those, not all well).
[16:09:41] <NicolasHillegeer> I get that. And messages is always available. But:
[16:09:41] <NicolasHillegeer>  - This behaviour should be suppressable.
[16:09:41] <NicolasHillegeer>  - We should see the reason for non-starting in `:LspInfo`
[16:09:41] <NicolasHillegeer>  - We should be able to fetch the reason for non-starting (or even exiting) for display in other surfaces (e.g.: lightline)

[16:13:14] <aktau[m]> Not sure I can spare the time for changing the code and arguing the benefit. I'll start out with a local hack. But thanks for providing the most important information: the message is intentionally there and not suppressible via a switch that I missed.
[16:15:09] <clason[m]> You could also try setting `autostart = false` and add an autocommand to `LspStart` for certain files.
[16:15:14] <zeraphel> What does require return when a given lua file does not return anything?   lspconfig/tsserver's root_dir does not include where the file is located.  I want to use that function in my final root_dir handler,  Can i do better than copy-pasting it?

[18:01:34] <mjlbach[m]> I don't understand why we need to add null-ls to lspconfig
[18:01:39] <mjlbach[m]> I didn't deprecate custom server support
[18:01:44] <clason[m]> "dirname" 🤦
[18:01:52] <kylo252[m]> that's why it's a draft 😃
[18:01:57] <mjlbach[m]> does null-ls even need a root?
[18:02:19] <kylo252[m]> I tried removing the `root_dir` arg and it stopped attaching altogether 
[18:02:29] <mjlbach[m]> ofc that breaks lspconfig
[18:02:30] <kylo252[m]> that's what I meant by needing `dirname` 
[18:02:47] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig still needs to try to find the root if SFM is disabled
[18:03:01] <kylo252[m]> removing just `dirname` also breaks attaching to single-files 
[18:03:17] <mjlbach[m]> ok, well that's a null-ls bug
[18:03:33] <kylo252[m]> I'm not sure I would call it a bug
[18:03:40] <kylo252[m]> rather than a missing feature 
[18:04:00] <clason[m]> if they want to use lspconfig instead of rolling their own (like metals is doing, correctly), it is.
[18:04:17] <kylo252[m]> I don't think lspconfig can handle switching back and forth between the two modes, but I might be mistaken
[18:04:28] <clason[m]> then null-ls should not be using lspconfig
[18:04:30] <mjlbach[m]> that doesn't make any sense
[18:04:34] <mjlbach[m]> there are no modes
[18:04:41] <mjlbach[m]> read the code, it's extremely simple
[18:05:03] <clason[m]> "read thrice, think twice, PR once"
[18:05:16] <kylo252[m]> I need to check if SFM is ignored on first success 
[18:05:35] <mjlbach[m]> ugh I should not have branded it as SFM
[18:05:47] <mjlbach[m]> SFM is dead, now "single file support" is what I will be calling it
[18:05:57] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: again, it's a draft for a reason. it was better than sharing the code here or over a gist

[19:10:36] <kylo252[m]> I feel like I'm missing something obvious here, how is it 2 lines? it can't be registered as a server anymore. so it needs to implement its own wrapper for `start_client`. or?

[19:53:27] <mjlbach[m]> kylo252: you mixed a lot of necessary changes in that PR that if I were jose would delay merging
[19:53:41] <mjlbach[m]> I'm pretty sure the configs change is the only thing that is strictly necessary to close the issue
[19:53:58] <clason[m]> * unnecessary? :P

[19:59:19] <mjlbach[m]> kylo252[m]: in lspconfig?

[20:00:14] *** Joins: xsteadfastx (~marv@94.31.100.46)
[20:01:30] <kylo252[m]> so either:
[20:01:30] <kylo252[m]> - expose `_make_config` in lspconfig and make it callable directly
[20:01:30] <kylo252[m]> - extract minimal set of functions that allows `try_add` to work. `null-ls` doesn't need `autostart`, so that should be slightly less code
[20:02:40] <mjlbach[m]> I'm going to throw out almost all of that code btw
[20:02:58] <mjlbach[m]> I'm just trying to provide y'all the minimum set of things I get frequent complaints about

[20:14:17] <kylo252[m]> I just found a bug as well, it will attempt index the workspace_folders for single-files
[20:14:46] <kylo252[m]> but I didn't catch it the first time, because it doesn't show up if the client started with a root_dir
[20:15:01] <kylo252[m]> I'm a bit confused as to why exactly that's the case
[20:15:22] <mjlbach[m]> I don't get why you lumped all those changes in
[20:16:43] <kylo252[m]> I wanted to remove the `dirname` stuff, which meant I needed to remove direct access to root_dir, which some of them weren't even working

[20:20:22] <kylo252[m]> I think that null-ls was performing some hack, intentionally or not regarding modifying the setup config after it's been registered 
[20:20:46] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach, is that supposed to work?
[20:21:01] <mjlbach[m]> literally all I changed is that you cannot directly index into lspconfig a server that has not been added to the configs table
[20:21:02] <mjlbach[m]> that is it
[20:21:07] <mjlbach[m]> and I added a nice error message
[20:22:18] <clason[m]> and it's clearly documented in :help lspconfig-adding-servers
[20:22:23] <kylo252[m]> I'm not sure, but making the minimal change will not pass any additinal config args to lspconfig. so how tf did we used to send `on_attach`?
