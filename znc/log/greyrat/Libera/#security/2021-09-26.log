[02:50:25] <Hash> Version 3 of HitmanPro has three different types of antimalware scans: Default Scan, Quick Scan, and Early Score Warning. The Default Scan will check the entire computer and will send suspicious files to the cloud.
[02:50:33] <Hash> Ok, so the design now is totally different
[02:50:39] <Hash> It used to work a lot like Tron

[02:51:51] <Hash> I can't recommend older versions as they are out of date.
[02:52:02] <Hash> So I wouldn't recommend it. I would say, maybe check it out.

[02:56:24] <Descartes> Can you use LibreOffice Draw for your PDF editing?
[02:56:27] <Hash> I do all my work in host machine, when time to do exam, fire up windows and that's it.
[02:56:33] <Hash> i guess.
[02:56:41] <Hash> Though there are others who work better
[02:56:45] <Hash> I think Sumatra is good
[02:56:58] <Descartes> Sumatra is free?
[02:57:37] <ajak> Phantom: not sure about those
[02:57:42] <Descartes> PDF editing is not working for me in LibreOffice 7.2 Draw, so I was thinking of installing Foxit Reader

[08:29:18] <Hydragyrum> also, most engineering fields aren't dealing with attackers
[08:29:40] <Hydragyrum> that bridge isn't having people drilling holes in it, poking it with jackhammers, etc. trying to bring it down

[19:35:08] <eson123> to +r by everyone

[19:49:57] <eson123> ajak: the thing is i am wondering what does it mean by "restricted access", to me restricted access is access that isn't allowed because the process or a file belongs to another group or user, but so far, all php files that i was leaking have a global read permission but i can't access them with the Local File Inclusion payload but i have to use the Loading Restricted Resources one
[19:51:08] *** Quits: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[19:51:28] <ajak> that looks to be an XXE payload to bypass access restriction in whatever the server is using to try to prevent XXE, probably nothing to do with standard OS access control
[19:52:36] <eson123> well that's weird, i mean if it does so to prevent XXE, then people can still bypass it using what i was reading
[19:52:44] <eson123> it would make the effort a bit wasteful then
