[00:51:05] <neo1> can someone suggest me resources for learning vim
[00:51:07] <neo1> maybe books
[00:51:45] <nickspoon> Have you read the user manual?
[00:51:57] <nickspoon> It's a pretty great resource

[00:52:26] <neo1> you mean the man pages?
[00:52:32] <nickspoon> No
[00:52:42] <neo1> okay
[00:52:48] <neo1> I mean I know a few stuff
[00:53:01] <nickspoon> The internal vim help is split into 2 sections, a reference section for looking stuff up, and a book, the user manula

[00:58:10] <neo1> I'm a high school student. Looking forward to doing Comp Science. And Comp Arch.  
[00:58:21] <neo1> there might be stuff like plugins and things like that
[00:58:51] <neo1> when I go for maybe customizing vim
[00:59:06] <neo1> does the manual cover that too?
[00:59:40] <neo1> damn. sorry I'm asking things I can just look up for myself
[00:59:58] <neo1> ah. the user-manual opened two instances of vim
[00:59:59] *** Quits: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:00:08] <nickspoon> The user manual tells you how vim works so if you start trying to customise with plugins you'll understand what's happening.
[01:00:08] <neo1> can you tell me how to close the empty one
[01:00:26] <neo1> Okie
[01:00:38] <neo1> is there anything else like that?
[01:00:40] <nickspoon> I mean the *very* first place to start is always vimtutor
[01:00:46] <neo1> okay
[01:00:57] <neo1> I tried vimtutor 
[01:01:10] <neo1> it got a bit boring
[01:01:23] *** Quits: Szadek (~Szadek@193.27.14.29) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[01:01:24] <neo1> I think I like the manual more
[01:01:27] <neo1> Hehe
[01:01:36] <neo1> Thanks a lot for the suggestion
[01:02:17] <nickspoon> no worries
[01:02:21] <neo1> ah
[01:02:37] <neo1> what do I do about the bottom instance though :)
[01:02:52] <almostdvs> close it
[01:02:56] <neo1> how?
[01:02:59] <neo1> :q
[01:03:04] <neo1> closes the whole thing
[01:03:31] <nickspoon> Using :help (:h) opens the help in a split window
[01:03:40] <neo1> yeah
[01:03:51] <neo1> can I open it in the main window
[01:03:52] <King_jul1an> The thing with vim is it's about muscle memory. So manuals are not really that helpfull if you dont practice the stuff, Also start with touch typing first , then something like practical vim , just learn the editor bare bones first , then you move onto vimscript and plugs only on a need to basis. ps! this is not a weeks work it will take time, be patient. 
[01:04:11] <nickspoon> If you close the other window with :q then vim thinks all its windows are closed
[01:04:16] <neo1> I do know touch typing
[01:04:32] <neo1> about 50-70 wpm
[01:04:40] <nickspoon> So in the help window, do `ctrl-w o`
[01:04:51] <neo1> damn
[01:04:54] <nickspoon> And to know what that does, ask vim:  :h ^wo
[01:04:54] <digmbot> :help ^wo -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/windows.txt.html#CTRL-W_o
[01:05:34] <King_jul1an> great , then try a book like practical vim 
[01:05:37] <almostdvs> had no idea; i just use :q
[01:05:57] <King_jul1an> and after that perhaps learn vimsript the hard way, 
[01:06:04] <almostdvs> as jul1an mentioned I wouldn't worry about customizing vim too much especially when learning
[01:06:04] <neo1> damn that was cool
[01:06:06] <nickspoon> Yeah I use :q for most things too, but for this particular situation, vim will see that all its "real" windows are closed, and just exit
[01:06:34] <neo1> what are these called
[01:06:36] <King_jul1an> the simple dot . is so powerfull
[01:06:42] <neo1> like the one I just used
[01:06:52] <nickspoon> what did you just use?
[01:06:55] <almostdvs> what are what called?
[01:07:01] <neo1> ctrl-w o
[01:07:11] <nickspoon> that's what it's called
[01:07:15] <almostdvs> lol
[01:07:16] <neo1> ah
[01:07:20] <nickspoon> Oh it's a normal mode command
[01:07:22] <irc_user> tbh I haven't read anything at all. My take is just use vim and if something feels like it could be done faster, it probably can be, and google until you find the answer.
[01:07:23] <neo1> I mean do they have any specific name
[01:07:26] <nickspoon> Is that what you mean?

[01:07:52] <neo1> Hehe
[01:08:57] <neo1> I'm looking forward to learning vim, tmux, and a few terminals

[01:09:21] <King_jul1an> correct IRC, I read and one forgets. it helps to read so you atleast know that something exist, so you could always look it up or ask here.. if you are making movemnts and edits using hjkl and more then 2 or 3 keystrokes then generally look into a solution from the gurus here

[01:10:21] <King_jul1an> oh and dont forget to nop that nasty arrows and backspaces and stuff , lol
[01:10:40] <almostdvs> meh
[01:10:59] <irc_user> tmux is kinda whatever, I personally don't get the point unless you're sshing into a lot of stuff. terminal emulators you just pick one you like and use it, nothing to "learn" for those really.
[01:11:00] <almostdvs> you have to move your hands to arrow keys; I don't see what the big deal is
[01:11:28] <neo1> nop meaning?
[01:11:56] <King_jul1an> no opperation, it forces you to learn movemnts that keep your hands closer to home row
[01:11:59] <nickspoon> I prefer hjkl for small movements but I don't have a problem with arrows. I just don't like wasted keys so I use those for other things
[01:12:09] <neo1> okay
[01:12:10] <nickspoon> I have the arrow keys mapped to resize splits
[01:12:16] <neo1> I'm using i3wm 
[01:12:18] <moshe> tmux has a handful of bad defaults that are easily fixed if you're running it locally. It's also very handy as some kind of "context separator" for lack of a better description
[01:12:28] *** Quits: mikoto-chan (~mikoto-ch@213.177.151.239) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:12:29] <neo1> so use hjkl most of the time
[01:12:32] <irc_user> I think there's a big difference when it gets repetitive. But either way, there are usually faster ways of doing stuff than either hjkl or arrow keys
[01:12:33] <nickspoon> I'm using i3, and tmux, and vim splits
[01:12:41] <almostdvs> ok
[01:12:52] <neo1> what's vim splits?
[01:12:56] <nickspoon> windows
[01:13:05] <neo1> windows?
[01:13:08] <irc_user> nickspoon: I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not LOL
[01:13:10] <nickspoon> like what happened before when you opened help in a new window
[01:13:19] <neo1> oh damn
[01:13:21] <neo1> sorry
[01:13:23] <neo1> hehe
[01:13:36] <almostdvs> I really think vimtutor is a better starting point than the manual
[01:13:37] <nickspoon> irc_user: sarcastic about what? I wasn't tho...
[01:13:39] <King_jul1an> no , after you learn vim language you start dropping hjkl as well like w, e, f , t , a , 0 , ^, b etc
[01:13:44] <nickspoon> almostdvs: definitely
[01:13:48] <neo1> vim tutor feels kinda boring
[01:13:52] <almostdvs> I would spend 15-20 minutes a day using that
[01:13:56] <neo1> I'm more into books hehe
[01:14:10] <nickspoon> it only takes a few minutes to go throught it, good practice when you're starting out

[01:14:24] <King_jul1an> learn vi and vim editors is quite a hefty book
[01:14:44] <neo1> okay
[01:14:47] <neo1> . ..

[01:15:40] <moshe> we went from a tarsier on acid to some coloring book atrocity
[01:15:44] <almostdvs> learning vim is pretty big but putting it to use by actually coding is a better endeavor
[01:15:58] <almostdvs> if something seems like vim can do it it probably can
[01:16:01] <King_jul1an> coding and writing these days 
[01:16:03] <nickspoon> Yeah, learn by doing
[01:16:10] <almostdvs> just google that and incorporate into your workflow
[01:16:15] <irc_user> nickspoon: In my mind if I'm lucky enough to be on linux with a tiling wm, what's the point of tmux and vim splits? Opening a new terminal just seems faster

[01:19:31] <almostdvs> :thumbsup:
[01:19:48] <neo1> ah
[01:20:13] <neo1> is there a channel for programming languages and stuff like that?
[01:20:24] <nickspoon> lots
[01:20:29] <almostdvs> theres a channel for most programming languages
[01:20:42] <almostdvs> you are seeking a metaprogramming channel?
[01:20:51] <irc_user> neo1: There are many, but regarding what you said "I like this place. . .", so do I but it really depends on the time of day. If someone's in a bad mood on one of these channels just don't take it personally.
[01:21:25] <neo1> I'm looking for something where I can get suggestions about programming languages like which to learn for what purpose and stuff
[01:21:46] <nickspoon> neo1: there's no right answer but ... learn python
[01:21:55] <neo1> okay
[01:21:59] <almostdvs> like I said if you are diving into this stuff I think it's real easy to get distracted on configuring vim, tmux etc. It would be better to just plow forward trying to program things and the others will come along as you have needs
[01:22:06] <neo1> Okie

[01:23:08] <neo1> didn't like web programming that much

[01:23:23] <moshe> healthy configuration = taking 20 minutes once to fix bad defaults in some way that won't come back to bite you in the ass
[01:23:54] <neo1> and really looking forward to doing assembly, reverse engineering and stuff
[01:24:04] <neo1> irc_user yeah... 
[01:24:27] <neo1> After using irc for just a few hours ig
[01:24:40] <neo1> would be less than 24 that I have used this
[01:24:56] <neo1> I feel like why do people use social media and stuff. . .
[01:25:12] <nickspoon> neo1: right if you're already into that kind of thing then stick with c probably - that'll be most useful to help understand what's happening in assembly. python is really handy for doing stuff quickly
[01:25:25] <irc_user> moshe almostdvs, to be honest I think a text editor has more use in daily life than a programming language, but that's just me. IMO, sometimes dozens of hours spent customizing something can pay off in one fail swoop, sometimes not.

[20:06:52] <dfdx> also included in the paste is my .vimrc.   Can anyone help me fix it? It's super annoying. It only happens when a number is the first "word" in a line.

[22:16:48] <zzz> my keyboard itself sends an Esc signal when i press caps lock. os doesn't even know about it
[22:17:17] <zzz> ah i see
[22:17:38] <strajder> I press Esc for Esc, and Caps Lock when I need to type in all caps; revolutionary, I know

[22:21:47] <strajder> I just press the correct key ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:21:54] <zzz> actually i might just do that. shift-caps
[22:22:12] <zzz> strajder: the advantage of my approach is that caps becomes the correct key
[22:23:28] <zzz> https://nikodoko.com/img/adm-3a-keyboard.jpg
[22:24:05] <strajder> the advantages of leaving everything on default settings are: 1) it works on fresh install and unknown systems (ssh), 2) less time spent on tinkering with vimrc, more time actually using vi(m) for something productive
[22:24:34] <zzz> strajder: i don't think you understand
[22:24:51] <zzz> my keyboard sends the signal i configured it to send
[22:25:19] <zzz> the os doesn't know anything about the position the key i'm pressing is is
[22:25:20] <zzz> in
[22:26:10] <zzz> so my caps key actually became esc
[22:26:25] <nova> zzz: the reason I am going with the ducky one 3 is because they have hotswap, and I ordered some holy panda switches
[22:26:28] <strajder> still you changed the defaults, in this case keyboard defaults

[22:30:04] <nova> no one is right or wrong. that's the point. if you do a ton of typing and use ctrl and escape a lot, you might like caps2esc or remapping your keyboard or whatever. If you swap machines/keyboards a lot you might not.

[22:40:18] <nova> I discovered that I actually like 60% keyboards with vim because the Esc is really close to Tab. Instead of having Caps be Esc when I tap and Ctrl when I hold and press another key, I can just remap caps to ctrl, which is a lot easier
