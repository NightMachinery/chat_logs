[05:44:00] <morlog> nah, i think the balance would be better if i was wearing it on the scooter

[05:45:37] <LibertyDillo> true also

[05:46:35] <LibertyDillo> why I like my bicycle saddle bags that hang down on a 100lb capable rack

[13:25:36] <artao> such as TRON 2.0
[13:25:46] <TheLinuxNerd> artao :-D
[13:25:50] <TheLinuxNerd> I <3 Consumerism!
[13:25:52] <artao> i have it on CD, but getting it on Steam would be SO much simpler
[13:26:07] <TheLinuxNerd> if you don't mind, I'll set up Christmas tree on the 1st of December :-)
[13:26:08] <murthy> artao: ya the extinction rebellion people are blockading the Amazon warehouses in the UK
[13:26:11] <TheLinuxNerd> the earlier the better
[13:26:30] <artao> particularly since 1) I don't currently even have an optical disc installed and 2) The CD has GOD AWFUL copy protection on it. The sort that can damage hardware. The Steam version has that removed
[13:26:46] <artao> i have no idea what extinction rebellion is
[13:26:56] <artao> but i assume they're rebelling against extinction
[13:27:02] <artao> in general or some specific species?

[13:27:23] <artao> blu ray
[13:27:27] <artao> high capacity
[13:27:34] <artao> i have 100s of gigs of data to back up
[13:27:47] <murthy> artao: Bluray ded
[13:27:51] <artao> tho i can reduce that by not backing up all the versioning i do
[13:27:58] <artao> often 10 or more versions
[13:28:09] <artao> lol how is blu ray ded?
[13:28:21] <artao> afaik it's the highest capacity optical storage medium
[13:28:36] <artao> backing up on SSD sounds good too, tho we don't really know the archival qualities of that
[13:28:41] <murthy> artao: Extinction rebellion is a international organisation that engages in environmental activism and politics
[13:28:43] <artao> multiple media is best of course
[13:28:51] <artao> it'd be nice to have a RAID 5
[13:29:32] <murthy> artao: SSD is the current standard, cloud is the future

[13:30:34] <artao> not 10
[13:30:36] <artao> i used to have 1`0
[13:30:37] <artao> 10

[13:30:56] <artao> yeah
[13:31:11] <murthy> SSD is drop proof
[13:31:58] <artao> so are optical media .. if encased

[13:32:22] <murthy> artao: user need is irrelevant for the big companies
[13:32:33] <murthy> They have heavily invested in big data
[13:32:48] <murthy> So whether we like it or not we will be forced to cloud
[13:32:59] <artao> i've got a bunch of old HDDs that are like 80 to 120 megs
[13:33:05] <artao> i could back up to those
[13:33:07] <artao> heh heh
[13:33:20] <artao> lol
[13:33:31] <artao> i have individual files that wouldn't fit on an entire drive

[13:34:00] <murthy> If they are proliferated then there won't be local storage, only thin clients

[13:40:55] <artao> you know what a firsbee is right?
[13:41:32] <murthy> Oh ya frisbee
[13:41:36] <murthy> We play that
[13:41:43] <artao> Frisbee is a brand name owned by Wham-o. They're "real" name is flying disc
[13:41:49] <murthy> I liked it a lot
[13:41:59] <artao> that vid explains it well
[13:41:59] <murthy> Oh ok
[13:42:11] <murthy> Like Xerox for photo copy
[13:42:33] <murthy> artao: why would someone find that bad?
[13:42:40] <artao> it uses a different type of frisbee designed for golf, but it STARTED with people throwing regular frisbees at trees
[13:42:50] <artao> good question murthy. if you find out let me know too eh
[13:43:18] <murthy> Probably some OCD freak like me
[13:43:34] <artao> disc golf courses are often made in public parks too. not like ball golf where trees are cut down and lawn is groomed and all that shit
[13:44:16] <murthy> Nice
[13:44:23] <artao> it's a nice walk in the woods (usually. depending where you are i suppose)
[13:44:40] <murthy> Ya
[13:44:42] <artao> many university campuses have baskets around the campus too
[13:44:54] <artao> and hole #7 is traditionally "the bowl hole"
[13:45:03] <artao> you stop and smoke a bowl of weed LOL

[13:59:00] <murthy> ?
[14:00:14] <artao> what do you mean by scenarios
[14:00:23] <artao> you can just explore. yeah
[14:00:52] <artao> but if you wanna get far you'll need to upgrade your ship or buy a new one, which means you'll hafta run missions or do trading. or both
[14:00:57] <murthy> I don't like fps except csgo sometimes
[14:01:14] <artao> you don't have to do combat if you don't want .... unless of course someone attacks you

[14:01:42] <murthy> I only play portal and the long dark for that reason
[14:02:14] <artao> but yeah. you can just explore. go neat places and look around. land on planets and drive around

[20:10:26] <Panther> In the social sciences, a result may be considered "significant" if its confidence level is of the order of a two-sigma effect (95%), while in particle physics, there is a convention of a five-sigma effect (99.99994% confidence) being required to qualify as a discovery.
[20:11:14] <Panther> That's a hefty burden of proof.

[22:46:54] <Panther> They have rooms, but there all cots lined up along the hallways with sick ppl suffering on them in the middle of the hall with everyone bustling past.
[22:47:02] <louipcD> but more likely it 'has' a shared hallway
[22:47:43] <louipcD> morf: do they write that in french or in english?
