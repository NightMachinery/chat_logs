[04:51:09] <JesseDesu> butternoodle i have no confidence in my honda's battery
[04:51:28] <ButterNoodle> yea
[04:51:36] <JesseDesu> i remember when i messengered in the city with this bike
[04:51:47] <ButterNoodle> with the shit charging on that.. I'd be nervous too
[04:52:00] <JesseDesu> i carried a spare motorcycle battery and jumper cables
[04:52:27] <JesseDesu> how do you know the alternator puts out 400watts
[04:52:48] <JesseDesu> are you supposed to read watts with a voltmeter
[04:53:26] <JesseDesu> i remember the shop soldered the alternator wire to the harness
[04:53:36] <ButterNoodle> they'd need to put a multimeter on it.. amp clamp the return from the alternator to see what the amperage it
[04:54:11] <ButterNoodle> or in front of the charge circuit..
[04:54:16] <ButterNoodle> or on the battery when the fan is running
[04:54:25] <JesseDesu> i can get by if my commute is a clean run with no traffic
[04:54:53] <JesseDesu> as soon as i hit 217 degrees the fan comes on until it goes back to 213
[04:55:48] <JesseDesu> without moving, its on continuously until i get moving again
[04:57:10] *** nekobit is now known as \neko\

[04:57:32] <JesseDesu> how
[04:57:50] <JesseDesu> something is wrong and i dont know what it is
[04:57:59] <ButterNoodle> there was a period of time that my commute was gridlocked because a main thruway in the city was blocked because a bridge was out...
[04:58:05] <JesseDesu> i need a more thorough electrical diagnosis

[18:57:58] <Sadale> 4GB of RAM is rather little for 64bit OS. For 32bit OS it's kind of ok tho. kind of.
[18:58:04] <berlin36> Not bad amigojapan
[18:58:20] <Sadale> lol I mean they're right. You could game on that shitty laptop if it's a low-end one

[18:58:32] <Sadale> Low-end games do exist

[19:00:19] <berlin36> It's about 10 years lol
[19:00:22] <amigojapan> Sadale: yeah old laptops usually have a broken battery
[19:00:26] <KatrinValerie> I am glad I bought a decent CPU and everything the last time I got a new desktop
[19:00:33] <KatrinValerie> this is going to last for a while I think
[19:00:41] <KatrinValerie> I should probably change the lithium battery though
[19:00:45] <berlin36> amigojapan, oh YESSS the battery problem
[19:00:51] <KatrinValerie> how many years do they usually last?
[19:00:58] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, same here. Mine computer is now a semi-decent one. Maybe I'd call it a mid-end one. :3
[19:01:02] <berlin36> Batteries?
[19:01:03] <Sadale> It's far better than a low-end laptop
[19:01:14] <berlin36> 3 years i think
[19:01:24] <berlin36> Well if used a lot, but idk for sure
[19:01:24] <KatrinValerie> Depending on what you do with your laptop, just get used high-end stuff.
[19:01:40] <KatrinValerie> I am still pretty happen with my 2015 MBP

[19:02:23] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: get over current protection
[19:02:25] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: with a laptop like mine, you could eject the battery when you are not taking it out and make it last longer
[19:02:48] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: that's not a 100% garante
[19:02:54] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: can also buy a new battery at Amazon
[19:03:00] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: yeah, the glued in battery packs suck.

[19:03:11] * Sadale has a weak power supply as well
[19:03:23] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: but it is possible to replace them, the glue can be dissolved with acetone easily.
[19:03:33] <KatrinValerie> It is just annoying
[19:03:39] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: what sucks more is that they won't boot when the battery is totally gone
[19:03:49] <KatrinValerie> ThinkPads are easier to repair imho
[19:03:50] <Bco1981> Sadale: you need the new Intel NUC

[19:06:44] <berlin36> Looks decent 
[19:07:00] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I was about to attempt replacing the battery before I fried mine. I had already bought the replacement unit
[19:07:00] <berlin36> Idk about the processor
[19:07:52] <Bco1981> berlin36: it's 4cores looks like no SMT so just the 4 cores.
[19:08:08] <berlin36> In our shops it's almost twice the price
[19:08:20] <berlin36> What is smt
[19:08:22] <Bco1981> no it does have SMT so 8threads
[19:08:38] <Sadale> SMT is hardware threading.
[19:08:42] <Bco1981> Simultaneous multithreading
[19:08:53] <berlin36> Yes 8 threads
[19:09:04] <Bco1981> berlin36: but only 4 actual cores
[19:09:04] <berlin36> So is that laptop any good?
[19:09:12] <Sadale> I think that those extra threads aren't quite helpful in most of the times tho
[19:09:36] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: so it can't be revived after the battery is dead?
[19:09:38] <pteague> KatrinValerie, you should watch some louis rossmann fix some ios garbage
[19:09:58] <KatrinValerie> pteague: louis isn't really specialised in iOS stuff, he does macbooks not iphones
[19:10:08] <Bco1981> Sadale: most amd tests show that smt threads are just as good, that they really do double performance if you "double" the threads.
[19:10:13] <KatrinValerie> Though one of his friends does iPhones
[19:10:18] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I think I would have been able to change the battery
[19:10:21] <Sadale> Bco1981, interesting.
[19:10:26] <Sadale> Bco1981, maybe it depends on the workload?
[19:10:31] <Bco1981> that could be
[19:10:47] <Bco1981> Cinebench says 95% increase in performance
[19:10:53] <Sadale> I always wonder how this technology even work. There's just a single core and a core can only do a thing at a time
[19:11:17] <Bco1981> berlin36: what do you have now ? cpu?
[19:11:17] <Sadale> Maybe it's making use of the idle time of the processes.
[19:11:34] <amigojapan> Sadale: that is a good question

[19:11:51] <berlin36> Lul
[19:11:56] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, booooo
[19:12:43] <Bco1981> Sadale: a cpu only uses a fraction of the clock cycles that it has. but with this extra micro code, you can address another cycle loop on the same core utilizing that core "better"
[19:12:47] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: I think it was something like when a thread waits on a resource the other thread gets to execute
[19:13:10] <amigojapan> Sadale: I thought a thread meant it has a physical circuit dedicated to running a process
[19:13:34] <Sadale> I think that thread in CPU is like, hardware thread?
[19:13:55] <Sadale> I really don't know. Anyway CPU thread is different from the thread in software programming.
[19:14:07] <amigojapan> Ok
[19:14:26] <amigojapan> Software can use time sharing
[19:14:28] <KatrinValerie> threads on a single core are done by context switching
[19:14:35] <KatrinValerie> which is expensive
[19:15:20] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981 gave a much better explanation of what HT is than me q.q

[19:16:15] <Sadale> Bco1981, expensive af. It's $320 and $435. I'm not gonna buy that. :P
[19:16:16] <Bco1981> Sadale: nice :D
[19:16:24] <Bco1981> ah.. yeah ofcourse it is
[19:16:43] <KatrinValerie> That's what happens when you do not use your knowledge, it deteriorates...

[19:44:18] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I don't know if I told you, but I'm trying to learn all the prefectures of japan
[19:44:29] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so I've been thinking about random geography questions too

[19:46:17] <amigojapan> Alright TsundereNoises 
[19:46:18] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: by the way, no one really agrees on what counts as "Northern New Hampshire"

[19:48:34] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: Mexico being 1/3 of North America is like stuff we learn in elementary school here
[19:48:57] <amigojapan> I see
[19:49:02] <TsundereNoises> I mean, we do kind of ignore central america in dumb ways
[19:49:22] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: by the way candy candy goes to Mexico too in the anime
[19:49:53] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: do you think it's a good depiction of mexico?
[19:50:39] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it's a normal caricature of Mexico, but better than nothing

[20:13:02] <ButterNoodle> and that was in 2017... imagine today
[20:14:00] <pteague> i'm going up to kc this weekend as a cousin died of covid last year so we're having a rememberance this year ... my mom informed me they had a homeless person move in on the corner down the street a couple weeks ago
[20:14:58] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I was in Chicago when I was a kid and I only remember deep dish pizza
[20:15:10] <pteague> ButterNoodle, geeze... comment at the top of that video for me from 4 weeks ago... "A friend of mine works in Chicago, and he says it's not that bad. He's a tail gunner on a school bus."
[20:15:54] <ButterNoodle> pteague: yea its pretty bad there.. 
[20:16:56] <ButterNoodle> I watch a few motorcycle youtubers from chicago and every video seems to have some kind of gang violence in it.. probably more to do with the area they are in tho
[20:17:00] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: you mean you saw the aftermath of a shooting in person?
[20:18:16] <ButterNoodle> crime tends to be higher in the lower income areas.. like west garfield park
[20:19:01] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: people complain about Mexico being dangerous but it is not like that
[20:19:06] <ButterNoodle> u can get drunk as fuck and bang hoes all night in rosemont.. only thing u gotta worry about is getting mugged
[20:19:14] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: the statistics say otherwise
[20:19:33] <ButterNoodle> just because u havent been a victim, doesnt mean it isnt true
[20:19:46] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: no, I meant "when I looked at the news, I saw 2 mass shootings in the news"
[20:20:04] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: you don't hear shots all night long
[20:20:09] <pteague> ButterNoodle, also doesn't help if you look like an american tourist ;)
[20:20:19] <amigojapan> Ah ok TsundereNoises 
[20:20:30] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: its also helps if ur rich and have body guards in mexico
[20:21:20] <amigojapan> Nah. It's just not like that
[20:21:31] <ButterNoodle> kinda the same mentality the elite have here in america.. crime doesnt happen if you have money
[20:21:44] <ButterNoodle> its ok amigojapan... the statistics speak for themself
[20:23:16] <pteague> ButterNoodle, cori bush
[20:24:39] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it's not statistics Mexico is being used as a scapegoat
[20:25:46] <amigojapan> "we are not that bad, Mexico is worse"is what people want too think
[20:25:54] <ButterNoodle> I dont see anyone from the united states trying to immigrate illegally to neighboring countries to get away from poverty and violence..
[20:26:28] <ButterNoodle> I mean mexico isnt venezuela
[20:26:31] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: my dad immigrated to Mexico cause he liked it
[20:26:41] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I would, but I'm worried about Canada building a wall

[21:00:08] <pteague> i drink until i pass out ... i bought some pills last night to help instead

[21:04:08] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: The issue is not the blue light alone, the issue is what one does at the PC and how it affects alertness.

[21:42:25] <theholyduck> as nvidia keeps upping the price on the 80ti anyway
[21:42:52] <Bco1981> lately was scalpers, miners  and insane demand 
[21:43:02] <theholyduck> ive been wanting to buy a new  gpu for a while to replace my old amd one. but in norway all the places that might HAVE gpus are reserving them for prebuilts
[21:43:09] <theholyduck> like i can buy a computer with a 3070 or 3080 at MSRP 
[21:43:11] <Bco1981> msrp on the 3080ti was the same ast 2080ti was... back in the day
