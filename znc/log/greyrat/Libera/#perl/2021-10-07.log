S3 with no egress fees.  going to look at getting my SP mirror back up and using it, cheaper storage and then it might just be a simple free cloudflare worker proxy.  might be able to do the whole thing for <$1/mo based on published goals for pricing

[00:31:39] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Welcome Back
[00:32:11] <simcop2387> gordonfish: yea moves are always annoying that way.  rack is finally reassembled and i need new rails for one of the servers.
[00:32:32] <gordonfish> What happened to the old ones?
[00:32:44] <gordonfish> s/ones/rails/
[00:33:11] <simcop2387> damaged in the previous move back in decemeber.  when i had to disassemble the whole thing for this move (to fit in car) the ball bearings came out finally.
[00:33:43] <simcop2387> it was holding together and could take weight but the moment all the tension and everything was off it just kinda popped
[00:34:23] <simcop2387> just these guys basically, not expensive fancy ones.  https://www.amazon.com/Rosewill-RSV-R28LX-Bearing-Sliding-Rackmount/dp/B0795Y3QM3
[00:34:25] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ Amazon.com: Rosewill RSV-R28LX Ball Bearing Sliding Rail for Rackmount Chassis : Electronics ]
[00:34:32] <gordonfish> Ouch. I once saw ball bearings explode before, looked like those pinball machines when you get a many ball bonus
[00:35:48] <simcop2387> pretty much, just much much tinier.  i knew it was going to happen, it was rough and scratchy when i would move the server around in the rack before
[00:37:07] <simcop2387> not a big deal, it's sitting on a rack shelf right now instead but it'd be nice to put it properly on rails again at the correct place in the rack.  that way it's just the top 8U taken up on the front (1U tape and bluray, 3U DIY disk shelf/server, 4U main server)
[00:37:49] <simcop2387> tempted to go with one of those ones where it's not actually attached to the case since i don't really work on it in the rack much and it doesn't need to slide

[14:36:16] <karjala> The method to calculate number of current nested evals seems to fail when using v5.32 (or 34?)'s try. try doesn't add a level at the caller stack.

[16:35:21] <locsmif> Or should I just use perlbrew? I want to develop something but preferably avoid touching the system local perl installation

[16:37:00] <locsmif> I figured as much, so perlbrew isn't it, so I figured the next best thing is to come here and ask, because now I don't really know what to do :p
[16:37:36] <LeoNerd> perlbrew is for building another perl *binary* if you don't want to run /usr/bin/perl.. but along with that it has the easy ability to install individual modules in its own place
[16:37:48] <LeoNerd> But separate to that, you can still use /usr/bin/perl and still install modules elsewhere

[16:40:31] <jabberwok> if you do use perlbrew, you can use its 'lib' feature to manage independent sets of libraries. For example you can do a base perlbrew install with no modules, create a lib off it, then run your program, run cpanm to install a few modules, re-run your program, and repeat to verify that you really only depend on the modules you think you do.

I was about to say I have my account using imap.gmail.com in TB and added a second one using imap.googlemail.com (and using @googlemail.com for the email) and I see the exact same folders (seriously, why does google call them "labels" ?) so I'm curious what features differ between using the two domains for the server field.
[23:16:18] <gordonfish> I can't find anything from searching online for that.
[23:16:49] <gordonfish> mst: You are right the IPs do differ (in the past they were the same but that has changed at some point.)
[23:18:11] <mst> gordonfish: it's not been the imap infrastructure that's differed for me - I despise gmail and only have an account at all because google turns it on without asking for consent
[23:18:40] <mst> well, I think it did that once, I managed to turn it off, then it turned it on again to use an unrelated service and now I can't turn it off again
[23:19:16] <mst> but the point here is that given those two domains are *not* entirely interchangeable, libary documentation being explicit about what they have and haven't tested is correct
[23:20:01] <mst> and "are just two domains for the same server" doesn't matter when I've previously seen the same google server for something else react differently to the username depending on which domain you end it with
[23:20:01] <gordonfish> Yeah I hate that shit as well.
