[00:49:30] <Telgareith> anybody know if a VM can use QSV under Xen (I think that's what Proxmox uses)
[00:49:49] <Telgareith> if I have to passthrough the entire iGPU so be it, i'll go buy some cheapo
[00:50:23] <Telgareith> wait, that board has a dgpu already, for IPMI
[00:51:34] <Telgareith> I'm googling, but the only article of note that I'm finding is trying to do it where you can let multiple VMs use the GPU. I just need plex to access it
[00:52:39] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> proxmox is kvm absed
[00:52:47] <Telgareith> kvm then
[00:52:54] <Telgareith> that's why I included that note
[00:53:00] <Telgareith> I'm still new to proxmox
[00:53:24] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> I havn't heard of QSV but if its some form of SRV, then not only does the hypervisor have to have support but the card does as well
[00:53:38] <Telgareith> SRV?
[00:53:50] <Telgareith> QSV is intel's hardware video encoder
[00:53:57] <Telgareith> Quicksync Video
[00:54:06] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> ahh ok. it sounded like you wanted to devide up the card
[00:54:10] <Telgareith> no
[00:54:15] <Telgareith> that's what the article I found is doing
[00:54:32] <Telgareith> I don't need that, I know it's nothing but pain lol
[00:55:13] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> I'm not an expert but I think you'll need to pass the card through
[00:55:38] <Telgareith> I'm of the same opinion
[00:55:39] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> unless there is a paravirtual driver that supports that feature.
[00:55:48] <Telgareith> but I don't have a box to test that with atm
[00:55:57] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> that's something you could googlefoo but i doubt it
[00:56:10] <Telgareith> like I said I tried to googlefu it
[00:56:37] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> your not going to be able to split up  the card for the reasons I mentioned
[00:56:48] <Telgareith> I repeat, don't want to
[00:56:59] <Telgareith> I just want one VM to be able to use QSV
[00:57:23] <Telgareith> if passing through the entire igpu is the solution I'm 100% OK with it
[00:58:39] <Telgareith> on another note, I still haven't really used my monitors for my new PC
[00:58:47] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> what
[00:58:51] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> gotta use all the monitors

[02:38:18] <A-KO> drops temperatures, power, etc.
[02:38:19] <bloody> also what was wrong with your pc
[02:38:40] <A-KO> so I went to upgrade my 3900X to the 5900X. Removed the CPU block, and I saw a bunch of corrosion on the copper plate
[02:38:42] <A-KO> so that sucked
[02:38:56] <A-KO> Thankfully I actually had another cooler lying around that I hadn't installed yet

[03:09:14] <Alternity> i worked at one for about 9 months as my 2nd job in IT, was great exp. but i gtfo as fast as I could :D
[03:09:49] <Alternity> then again i found working with different clients all the time pretty exausting, much rather work for a single company and be able to take the time to do things right instead of just stopgap

[03:15:31] <Alternity> easily do like 80k with that

[03:18:47] <sd> 15<z​eroconf> wow nice!

[03:19:37] <Work-BWMerlin> I think IaC is the way
[03:19:41] <Alternity> but you can do things like infrastructure as code, kubernetes, containers on prem so I don tthink that will change

[03:23:16] <Work-BWMerlin> Not yet, it isn't looking super great outside and the radio said there would be storms

[09:42:22] <Cl0udNinja> nobyk, the place I was at previously was very hardware driven. a VR company. I designed a system that allowed you to walk into a brand new store, plug a USB stick in to one of the rack server, come back a few hours later to a store ready for use.

[09:42:57] <Cl0udNinja> got tired of that shit so I started working on a thing to allow me to remotely plug, unplug and move usb sticks around

[09:43:40] <Cl0udNinja> right, because this would be a fresh store and theres no supporting hardware onsite

[09:51:48] <Cl0udNinja> vs how I have to now which is have the atmel read the spi, pass the spi to the encryption chip via i2c, and then read the data back via i2c

[09:54:53] <Cl0udNinja> I'm not even concerned about the encryption shit atm. I just need to get a functioning web server that can read the whole request instead of just the request URI line
[09:56:09] <Cl0udNinja> the iolibrary shit sucks and is terribly documented. I've yet to find anything else that does more than a very basic webserver

[10:21:22] <Cl0udNinja> >e additional information? We don't care about the type of browser, our server hasn't got sufficient resources to maintain a cache or an access log, and if the file we're sending has an unacceptable character set, there's nothing that can be done about it. Even the HTTP version number on the first line isn't needed; we're planning to use the simplest HTTP interface anyway.
[10:21:22] <Cl0udNinja> It would seem that we can chop off the remainder of the command after the filename, without losing any functionality,
[10:21:35] <Cl0udNinja> so the example just cuts the shit out that I wanted anyway

[13:36:44] <Hunterkll> in fact
[13:36:45] <Hunterkll> hilariously
[13:36:48] <Hunterkll> the example ISO they show there
[13:36:51] <Hunterkll> is Win10 enterprise
[13:36:53] <Hunterkll> lulz
[13:37:17] <pcspkr> the real way is to use the oscdimg mastering utility microsoft provides
[13:37:41] <pcspkr> you pull the files out of the iso, make your edits, then use oscdimg to master a new iso
[13:37:49] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: and the proper way to achive this is to install MDT and make a proper task sequence/boot media that way
[13:38:02] <sd> 09<H​aise> ^^
[13:38:03] <Hunterkll> it can even spit out the generated customized ISO if you need that for some reason instead of just building a straight USB key 
[13:38:16] <xe0n> ++
[13:38:23] <xe0n> he could literally install mdt, import his wim, generate an iso
[13:38:24] <xe0n> lol!
[13:38:29] <Hunterkll> right?
[13:38:35] <pcspkr> microsoft oem documentation explicitly mentions oscdimg for creating oem installation media
[13:39:03] <Hunterkll> yes, but A.) we're not actually customizing anything but the install.wim and B.) that's a shitload of useless overhead to re place one file
[13:39:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:39:19] <xe0n> c) this problem was solved the correct way 10-15 years ago...

[13:39:55] <sd> 13<C​olour> Huh
[13:39:58] <pcspkr> the overhead is really small
[13:39:59] <xe0n> all my machines here were task sequenced
[13:40:07] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: i meant overhead as in level of effort, etc
[13:40:16] <Hunterkll> as opposed to literally just swapping the file in an already working and finished iso
[13:40:16] <pcspkr> c+p files from mounted iso, edit .wim, run oscdimg
[13:40:21] <pcspkr> if you have adk installed it's like 5 minutes
[13:40:30] <Hunterkll> or open iso, replace file, done in 10 seconds 
[13:40:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:40:57] <Hunterkll> that's what we did for our 2012 installer at a place I was at in 2013

[13:47:50] <Hunterkll> @giraffe also, another thing - on modern UEFI systems, the firmware actually looks at the file system to find the boot loader/bootable file, so traditional bootsector doesn't actually matter anymore, juts the vendor's UEFI implementation's ability to read the .efi files and execute them
[13:48:29] <Hunterkll> that's why literally copying the ISO files to a flash drive via copy and paste just works instead of needing to use special tools (assuming, of course, it's formatted fat32)

[15:27:37] <nobyk> I guess first thing is the hole tile/wallbackground thing you have to figure out
[15:27:44] <nobyk> then the fuckload of items
[15:27:51] <nobyk> and the progression
[15:27:51] <csws> then all the weird dungeons
[15:27:58] <nobyk> god it's so good
[15:31:09] <nobyk> But yeah I think expert mode is the best mode
[15:31:51] <csws> one game I wish I had the patience for is rimworld
[15:31:55] <csws> it looks great but I can't play it

[17:51:41] <bloody> is housing more expensive in alabama
[17:51:43] <yuken> Dang. I'll ship you an upper parts kit and you can buy a complete lower for like, $130 PublicWiFi.
[17:51:50] <PublicWiFi> oh shit!
[17:51:57] <spiderman> alabama sounds more expensive than kentucky
[17:52:00] <vonunov> PublicWiFi: lol ok yeah it looks like all the big transit stuff is going through Nashville and Memphis, though I guess between that and Atlanta, Chattanooga can get a lot of the job market benefits without being a major hub or anything
[17:52:01] <PublicWiFi> bloody: yeah it is a little, mostly cause we're looking to be 30-45 mins from teh beach
[17:52:05] <yuken> A cheap kit is like, $299 regularly from PSA PublicWiFi.
[17:52:07] <bloody> ah
[17:52:14] <yuken> Blemished kits and such.
[17:52:16] <PublicWiFi> BUT the property taxes n shit are lower, so i think our payment will be roughly the same or less
[17:52:23] <PublicWiFi> even with a house that's valued 50k higher, its insane
[17:52:35] <yuken> PublicWiFi, https://palmettostatearmory.com/blem-psa-16-mid-length-5-56-nato-1-7-nitride-moe-upper-with-bcg-ch-rear-mbus-black.html like this thing that I've been eyeing for a friend.

[17:53:34] <spiderman> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[17:53:34] <yuken> I have an out-of-state, non-residents CCW permit from New Hampshire, which is valid in Ohio.

[17:53:56] <PublicWiFi> yuken: you from NH or did you do that on purpose lol
[17:54:17] <tool> PublicWiFi: You do it so you get the recipiprocity with other states
[17:54:20] <yuken> PublicWiFi, did it on purpose. Ohio never defines a minimum CCW age, just a "you must have a valid license" and also "we recognize licenses from these states as valid licenses"
[17:54:20] <PublicWiFi> bloody: nope :( I think theres one in Lex but I can't remember
[17:54:28] <tool> Same reason I have a Utah non-resident CCW
[17:54:30] <bloody> yeah it's in lexington
[17:54:36] <yuken> tool, nope. That isn't it. I can't get the permit in my own state, but my state recognizes it, even as a resident of this state.
[17:54:36] <bloody> dave portnoy gave it a 0.0 on barstool
[17:54:41] <PublicWiFi> tool: I was gonna get my concealed but KY changed it last year to where you don't need one so I didn't spend the money
[17:54:48] <PublicWiFi> but Alabama still requires one so ill have to get it before I leave

[17:55:06] <PublicWiFi> tool: yeah I've been meaning to
[17:55:09] <spiderman> dave portnoy is a tool because he will never give a pizza 10/10, but he is fine giving a 0. That's bullshit and you know it
[17:55:19] <spiderman> there is no such thing as a 0/0 pizza

[17:55:29] <yuken> Very few states actually have reciprocity with this permit at my age, sadly. I'm both under 21, and not a resident of the state I have a permit in.
[17:55:34] <yuken> PA recognizes the permit, but only as a resident of the state.

[17:57:09] <PublicWiFi> tool: not at all,  just gotta pay teh sheriff their bribe money and plink some stuff to prove competency haha
[17:57:18] <bloody> example, a 9/10 is comparable to something like lucalis in brooklyn
[17:57:26] <yuken> PublicWiFi, I didn't even need to show up in person for this permit.
[17:57:27] <bloody> so if the pizza is comparable to that, it's in the 9s
[17:57:33] <tool> spiderman: I was born in rural Kentucky and my mother was sent home with my birth certificate and resident CCW permit

[18:56:26] <signofzeta> @Colour: In the UK, tipping isn't a thing (I gather).  In the U.S., federal minimum wage is $7.25, but the tipped wage is $2.13. That's all a business owner needs to pay his servers. Thus, tipping is expected.

[18:57:13] <spiderman> tipped wage only applies if you get tips, if you don't make at least minimum wage when you factor tips, your pay gets bumped to minimum wage
[18:57:15] <JollyRgrs> in the past, servers have actually been able to make a LOT of money

[20:57:54] <A-KO> yeah
[20:58:00] <A-KO> it starts using "max" then downsizes later

[21:02:11] <A-KO> that's not a max number? hmmm
[21:02:21] <Hunterkll> nope
[21:02:27] <Hunterkll> that maximum is how far dynamic will allow it to grow

[21:04:03] <A-KO> the 5600x is totally fine for normies

[21:17:06] <Hunterkll> "AT&T to run its mobility network on Microsoft’s Azure for Operators cloud, delivering cost-efficient 5G services at scale
[21:17:06] <Hunterkll> "
[21:17:34] <Hunterkll> or a relay
[21:17:39] <Hunterkll> one that's default open 
[21:17:54] <yuken> I'm trying to make sure that my lithium batteries won't over-discharge, basically.
[21:17:56] <Hunterkll> voltage too low =- relay not engaged = circuit break
[21:17:58] <Hunterkll> .....
[21:18:06] <Hunterkll> you're using unprotected cells?
[21:18:15] <yuken> I don't believe so, no.
[21:18:26] <Hunterkll> then if they over discharge you're fine
[21:18:30] <Hunterkll> because they can't
[21:18:36] <Hunterkll> they'll cut off, and won't turn back on till you recharge
[21:18:41] <Hunterkll> that's what the protection in the cells is ....
[21:18:42] <yuken> Really? Surely it'd still be a good idea to do that.
[21:18:56] <Hunterkll> protected cells have a little BMS built in 
[21:19:04] <Hunterkll> what kinda cells are you talking about though
[21:19:42] <yuken> Just 18650s, or 21700s.
[21:19:55] <Hunterkll> riiight...
[21:20:01] <Hunterkll> so you're using unprotected cells most likely
[21:20:05] <Hunterkll> go learn what a BMS is and get one
[21:20:07] <yuken> I haven't chosen the exact batteries.

[21:21:17] <Hunterkll> that's what a BMS is for/handles
[21:21:28] <yuken> I know what a BMS is, I just have no clue how one works.
[21:21:51] <Hunterkll> it disconnects the battery if charge voltage gets too high, and disconnecty it if pack voltage gets too low
[21:21:55] <Hunterkll> at the basic core of it anyway

[21:25:15] <yuken> Hunterkll, well, said BMS is massive and also, not really necessary for what I want.
[21:25:19] <yuken> I'd have a separate charger.
[21:25:25] <Hunterkll> ...
[21:25:29] <Hunterkll> you charge *through* the BMS

[21:26:07] <yuken> Hunterkll, vape pen.
[21:26:24] <Hunterkll> yea see 
[21:26:30] <Hunterkll> then go buy the batteries made for vape pens
[21:26:35] <Hunterkll> they have the protection circuit built in
[21:26:36] <yuken> nah.
[21:26:51] <Hunterkll> https://www.18650batterystore.com/collections/button-top-18650-batteries
[21:26:57] <Hunterkll> just look at those
[21:27:05] <Hunterkll> 'protected' means it has a tiny BMS inside the wrapper
[21:27:14] <Hunterkll> and is slightly longer than a 'regular' 18650 
[21:27:23] <Hunterkll> problem solved
[21:27:30] <yuken> I'm 3D printing a little box enclosure, and want to shove an 18650 in there and make my own little overdischarge protector.
[21:28:04] <Hunterkll> yea, no, you're just gonna buy a BMS circuit/cell with one and use that
[21:28:12] <yuken> Sounds terrible.
[21:28:22] <Hunterkll> when i 'make my own' i buy premade BMS chips and assemble the boards/circuits to my own specs, sure
[21:28:32] <Hunterkll> but i'm not trying to fuck around with batteries like that and buy shit that works
[21:28:37] <yuken> awesome.
[21:28:40] <Hunterkll> i've got a giant pile of eval boards
[21:28:43] <Hunterkll> for different BMS chips
[21:28:58] <yuken> I want to figure out how such circuits work, and internet seems very unhelpful there so far.
[21:29:22] <Hunterkll> its a tiny microcontroller, voltage too low, disconnect/turn off power mosfets
[21:29:25] <Hunterkll> voltage too high, do same
[21:29:26] <Hunterkll> thats it
[21:29:40] <Hunterkll> now, of course, columb counters, etc, lots of more advanced functionality
[21:29:47] <Hunterkll> but it's pretty blatantly obvious how it works just from the board picture
[21:29:47] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:30:02] <yuken> Sounds like that'd have a small, constant drain on the batteries.
[21:30:08] <Hunterkll> absurdly tiny 
[21:30:17] <Hunterkll> micro/pico amps tiny
[21:32:40] <Hunterkll> Ti's TPS65010 for example, one i'm really familiar with - 70 microamps 'idle' power 
[21:33:09] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Thought the protected batteries had a fuse too or something
[21:33:19] <Hunterkll> not really
[21:33:30] <Hunterkll> maybe a resettable efuse 
[21:33:42] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> gotcha so just and under/over volt cutoff
[21:33:47] <Hunterkll> like the ones that totally cut off voltage connection, and then come back online when you apply charging voltage
[21:34:04] <Hunterkll> like actually hard nuke themselves until you've hooked up charging voltage again
[21:34:28] <Hunterkll> laptop batteries do that often - you actually have to 'jump' the battery if it's been setting in storage too long to get voltage live on the pins again so the charger circuit will recognize it

[21:36:30] <Hunterkll> yuken: but 70 microamps is 0.00007 amps when not in use, essentially...... which, being 62 days of 'runtime' may seem really low, but that's just *one* operation mode 
[21:36:45] <Hunterkll> assuming a 2500mAh single cell
[21:37:00] *** Joins: bloody (~bloody@user/bloody)
[21:37:03] <yuken> Hunterkll, I thought it'd be more complex than just "microcontroller watches voltage".
[21:37:41] <Hunterkll> well, sure, there's all sorts of other things that you can get into in fancier ways 
[21:37:48] <Hunterkll> like using a columb counter to measure how much current has gone in/out 
[21:37:59] <Hunterkll> that's a BMS function you can add, which then gives you an estimate of the current state of charge
[21:38:08] <Hunterkll> aka how your phone shows you what % battery is estimated to be left
[21:38:21] <Hunterkll> lots of more advanced shit you can do but again
[21:38:24] <Hunterkll> at the end of the day
[21:38:28] <Hunterkll> that BMS i li n ked you on amazon?
[21:38:34] <Hunterkll> there's not even a microcontroller on it
[21:38:41] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> bms is a great sim
[21:39:11] <Hunterkll> yuken: here's a single cell, 4A maximum current BMS
[21:39:12] <Hunterkll> https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pbWvSjqwL._AC_SL1000_.jpg
[21:39:20] <Hunterkll> well, single series, obviously you can parallel a bunch of cells
[21:39:25] <Hunterkll> but it's really just that simple
[21:39:26] <yuken> Hunterkll, the way I assumed something would work without a microcontroller is "transistor with a minimum voltage higher than my target minimum voltage"
[21:39:34] <yuken> so when the battery discharges, transistor doesn't want to go.
[21:41:06] <Hunterkll> yuken: little more intelligent than that.... like, you want +/- 1% accuracy and hard off, etc
[21:42:50] <PublicWiFi> gonna ask again since its busier in here lol
[21:42:51] <Hunterkll> goohere's a good example with application notes, etc https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq2980.pdf?ts=1634580748689
[21:43:26] <Hunterkll> yuken: that one would probably be good for you - shutdown state it consumes 0.1 microamps, normal operation mode 4 microamps
[21:43:53] <Hunterkll> the TPS65010 i was mentioning earlier is something yuo'd use along the lines of say, inside a cellphone wtih multiple power sources/relay/etc
[21:43:53] <PublicWiFi> lets say I have a out-of-box driver group for a certain model of machines on MDT,I have a task variable set to change the driver dir to whatever/%make%/%model%. Using this method if I hava  machine that doesn't match any of the make/model groups i have will it just silently fail to inject any drivers and continue on?
[21:44:07] <Hunterkll> i wouldn't say fail
[21:44:12] <Hunterkll> it just won't match, and will keep going
[21:44:15] <PublicWiFi> dope
[21:44:18] <PublicWiFi> so it just won't inject shit
[21:44:18] <Hunterkll> that's not exactly a failure mode
[21:44:21] <PublicWiFi> right
[21:44:29] <PublicWiFi> well itll fail to open the dir I suppose
[21:44:32] <PublicWiFi> if it doesn't exist
[21:44:33] <Hunterkll> well, not quite sure how you may have it set up 
[21:44:45] <Hunterkll> but the way we do it, yea
[21:45:03] <PublicWiFi> meh ill just try something later that's not in a group
[21:46:30] <Hunterkll> yuken: in fact, the BQ297x series from Ti is something you'd probably find in a 'protected' cell you'd buy anyway
[21:47:04] <Hunterkll> https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/introduction-to-battery-management-systems/
[21:47:10] <Hunterkll> that'll get you an idea
[21:47:17] <Hunterkll> note almost any sane/reliable system has some kind of microcontroller
[21:47:22] <yuken> hm. that block diagram isn't too complex.
[21:47:26] <Hunterkll> a fair am ount of designs utilize efuses 
[21:47:27] <Hunterkll> etc
[21:47:34] <Hunterkll> yuken: yea its also a ridiculously tiny surfaec mount chip
[21:47:35] <Hunterkll> :P
[21:47:42] <yuken> Hunterkll, what about battery protection _before_ microcontrollers? All done by hand & fuses & whatnot?
[21:48:02] <Hunterkll> larger circuit boards and.... microcontrollers
[21:48:23] <Hunterkll> yuken: Li-Ion battery tech isn't exactly that old 
[21:48:28] <sintax> all i know batteries and electricity just restart my heart when i start messing with them
[21:48:31] <yuken> well ja.
[21:48:36] <Hunterkll> the first commercialized lithium ion batteries were released in 1991

[21:49:31] <Hunterkll> so 'before' microcontrollers is a tricky question there because there's no real 'before' :P
[21:51:26] <yuken> but there were lead-acid batteries and a lot of other types, nickel-cadmium, whatnot.
[21:51:44] <Hunterkll> yes
[21:51:46] <Hunterkll> which well
[21:51:52] <yuken> much less explodey?

[21:53:04] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> more like "call the bank for a loan"
[21:53:12] <Hunterkll> sure still wears the battery down faster to deep discharge but
[21:53:15] <sintax> just give them your first born
[21:53:15] <Hunterkll> unlike with li-ion
[21:53:21] <Hunterkll> where if you hit 0v, just throw the cell away 
[21:53:23] <Hunterkll> it's now unsafe to use
[21:53:43] <int0x1C8> just get an RTG
[21:53:43] <Hunterkll> a fully discharged li-ion grows crystals and all sorts of other shit, will get SUPER fucking hot and possibly explode when charging, etc 
[21:53:48] <int0x1C8> no need for batteries
[21:54:13] <Hunterkll> now
[21:54:16] <Hunterkll> if you still have 0.01v 
[21:54:22] <Hunterkll> that's a different story and the cell can be safely ressurected
[21:54:25] <Hunterkll> but if it's truly flat
[21:54:27] <Hunterkll> it's now a danger
[21:55:45] <int0x1C8> I bet you could make yourself a horribly dangerous RTG by getting americium out of smoke detectors
[21:55:48] <sd> 11<H​otmess> in general you put battiers in serise to up the voltage
[21:56:07] <sd> 11<H​otmess> however you put them in parrell to share the load between the battery banks.

[21:56:55] <Hunterkll> yuken: basically, the point of the systems in use with li-ion/li-po is because of the danger factor of overcharging/overcurrent/complete discharge 
[21:57:10] <Hunterkll> with other tech, it's just not as critical

[22:02:46] <Hunterkll> so comparable in width/length to the cell itself

[22:03:25] <yuken> I don't need anything crazy, Hunterkll. I'm doing... basic bitch stuff, very infrequently (once every other week).
[22:03:31] <Hunterkll> well
[22:03:39] <Hunterkll> i mean, even with a 0.8 coil, you're still only looking at 5 amps anyway
[22:04:56] <sd> 11<H​otmess> depends entirely on the width,lenght,material and frequency of coil
[22:05:23] <Hunterkll> yuken: but yes, that one th ere is using the DW01 IC and a set of surface mount power mosfets and that's about it 
[22:05:32] <Hunterkll> here's the datasheet on that IC: http://www.haoyuelectronics.com/Attachment/TP4056-modules/DW01-P_DataSheet_V10.pdf

[22:52:53] <Hunterkll> so if for some reason you have a 100Wh battery but it has 3 grams of lithium content, then it's treated as a 101-160Wh battery instead

[23:23:12] <yuken> Hunterkll, that isn't true either lol. You _CAN"T_ build for sale without an FFL, period.

[23:56:36] <Hunterkll> @H​urdyGurdyBurdy to a point, but we're talking about parts that aren't even added to the spec, and again, need special priv/permissions/access level to even function if they were added to the s pec
