[14:34:22] <PMT> The problem is, AIUI, that they added a symbol to grub, grub updates only reinstall grub on the disk(s) configured, so if you were booting from grub on another disk, it ends up being too old so loading things from the updated grub setup errors out on missing symbol.

[14:34:44] <AceSlash> ok, unfortunate

[14:35:05] <PMT> Let me see if I can remember the syntax
[14:35:35] <PMT> oh maybe not, even that requires a module, womp womp
[14:35:54] <AceSlash> I can fix it with debian install media, right?
[14:36:07] <PMT> the thought i had was chainloading the grub on the up-to-date disk, but it seems chainloading might require the "chain" module loaded
[14:36:33] <PMT> I think that bug report has a detailed explanation of how to fix it and not just work around it, though I didn't read it closely.
[14:37:16] <AceSlash> looks like the fix is to reinstall grub on the drive for now
[14:38:12] <PMT> The ultimate fix is to reconfigure it to install grub on the relevant disk(s). A workaround is to just manually update it once.

[17:45:56] <sbn> Systems upgraded from older releases that still use network interfaces with names like eth0 or wlan0 are at risk of losing networking once they switch to buster; see Section 5.1.6, “Migrating from legacy network interface names” for migration instructions.

[17:58:33] <jhutchins> As you can imagine, changing the interface names could be a bit disasterous if you were upgrading a remote server that you didn't have physical access to.
[17:59:04] <jhutchins> I've seen systems where they detected that the old form names were in use and preserved them, and it seems short-sided not to provide that option.
[17:59:04] <sbn> Deffo :)
[17:59:39] <PMT> The document says the mechanism for doing so is no longer supported, so it's unclear they could.
[18:00:21] <PMT> It certainly might work, but if it broke, you get to keep all the pieces, etc.

[18:01:57] <sbn> I just find it difficult to interpret the configuration files of service I haven't manually installed. So I can't really determine if I would break something or not. And then it will cascade in me having to spend a lot of time in learning things that I probably do not care about :D I know #lazy isn't the best way to be an administrator
[18:02:47] <PMT> Like many things, it's a sliding scale of cost/benefit.
[18:04:07] <sbn> Before my burnout I wouldn't care so much about learning all of these things in my spare time (or better said, breaking all things). But since my burnout I have to be weary not to spend too much time (or stress) on these things

[21:14:53] <s2w> ratrace: its not the kind of thing that gets voted on. Its something that the release team decides, announces and everyone just accepts since its their purview. Here's the announcement and the subsequent lack of any reaction from the maintainers: https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2010/10/msg00026.html
[21:14:56] <sussudio> i wonder why there's still people on freenode after they dropped all the nick and channel registrations.
[21:15:00] <PMT> Adding an optional repo for "unmaintainable shit" seems like a story that will end poorly.

[21:15:57] <jelly> intertia is a hell of a drug
[21:16:07] <jelly> inertia* dammit
[21:16:45] <sussudio> also, why are there still servers. who would want to be associated with this shit.
[21:16:50] <ratrace> s2w: so the team voted then, unless they're borg and of hive mind. the idea to use /updates must've originated from ONE person. and the rest of the team was nodding and saying "great idea!"
[21:17:19] <ratrace> it's that though process I'd pay serious money, to observe. how the hell does it happen and get accepted as "good idea".
[21:17:50] <ratrace> *thought
[21:18:03] <s2w> so I'm sure that some of the reason its updates and not security is because this includes the packages formally classified as "volatile" right?
[21:18:38] <PMT> I'm sure some people on freenode are there because they haven't noticed or heard anything about it, some people aren't paying attention to their client, and some people either don't care or actively favor the freenode side of the drama.
[21:18:56] <s2w> ratrace: volatile containing things that change mid-release which are not security related, like clamav data files
[21:19:17] <ratrace> PMT: yeah but freenode netsplit itself. there's no way in ten hells that nobody noticed by now. they all got disconnected and had to re-register
[21:19:37] <ratrace> %s/that nobody noticed/that someone exists who didn't notice/
[21:20:08] <ratrace> s2w: but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talkinga bout the decision to name the repo <release>/updates, instead of <release>-security
[21:20:28] <sussudio> ratrace: did you miss the deranged, possibly google-translated, server-wide messages?
[21:20:30] <PMT> ratrace: you are giving everyone a lot of credit.
[21:20:52] <ratrace> sussudio: no I nuked my acct and left Freenode within hours of the first leak by kline
[21:20:54] <jelly> PMT, I kind of tried to explain things to one semi-old-timer that not only stays on new-freenode, but also re-registered and got "interim" ops in #ubuntu and maybe #debian.  He's either REALLY averse to change, or very good at trolling
