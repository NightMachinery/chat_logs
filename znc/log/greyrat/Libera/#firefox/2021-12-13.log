[00:07:03] <ede> Timvde: absolutely. 2GB of DDR2-800, K6-2 3.2, 80GB HDD. bios date from 14 years ago.
[00:07:27] <ede> 09/07/2007 exactly.
[00:09:42] <Timvde> Yea, I don't think that hardware can run any modern browser properly tbh :/
[00:10:26] <ede> it runs fine until it grabs the bits next to the last ones of the RAM
[00:10:46] <Timvde> The RAM is faulty even?
[00:11:08] <ede> 1.33/1.96 now, music.youtube open (no video, but their JS is evil enough)
[00:11:25] <ede> no, i just could need some more of it heh
[00:12:22] <ede> i should try to compare the performance with a version from the early 2010s, i could even run a second instance including a flashgame in facebook back then...
[00:13:50] <ede> but i should throw some memtest iso on my ventoy stick, don't know when i ran it for the last time

[21:16:20] <Nelluk> i am trying to move from chrome to firefox but a few niggling issues are bothering me. for example i cannot log in to WSJ.com. i've tried removing it from a site-specific container and turned off enhanced tracking protection
[21:17:16] <fuxaches> why is it, with some google queries, that the microsoft site search queries that come up give me an ssl certificate issue. When I use google chrome or edge for the same query and choose the same link, there is no issue with the link. Only with firefox and this is on three different machines... 
[21:17:25] <fuxaches> ?
[21:19:54] <fuxaches> the error:  An error occurred during a connection to answers.microsoft.com. The OCSP response does not include a status for the certificate being verified.
[21:19:55] <fuxaches> Error code: MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_OCSP_RESPONSE_FOR_CERT_MISSING
[21:20:55] <fuxaches> the google query on firefox is:  windows 10 intermittent connection disconnects when idle
[21:21:14] <fuxaches> and choosing any of the microsoft site queries create that error

[21:21:53] <stevessss> so.. if I want notifications from google calendar... but I want to limit it to 1 notification per minute... so if I ahve calendar open in 5 tabs and 5 tabs send notifications I only see the first one... is there a way to do this?
[21:22:03] <stevessss> tab1: meeting in 10 mins
[21:22:07] <stevessss> tab2: meeting in 10 mins
[21:22:11] <stevessss> tab3: meeting in 10 mins
[21:22:42] <stevessss> is there a way to filter out duplicate notifications?

[21:37:26] <t4nk_freenode> holy smokes, is it just me, or... when using crtl-f in a page, ff95.0, it will act if there are no results until you've completed typing in the exact term!
[21:37:52] <t4nk_freenode> so: no check, no checks, no checksu, but only checksums
[21:38:44] <t4nk_freenode> that's a nuisance!

[21:44:00] <t4nk_freenode> (got started by a site that was hijacking ctrl-f to search the whole site)
[21:51:44] <fuxaches> can someone tell me why, when typing this query into google search engine on firefox "windows 10 losing internet connection intermittently when idle" when paying attention to the answers.microsoft.com glob of results? While choosing one of these from Microsoft's site, there is an SSL certificate issue. The issue doesn't happen on the same machine with a different browser, but it happens on a different machine using firefox browser 100%
