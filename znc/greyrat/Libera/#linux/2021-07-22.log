[00:00:31] <TJ-> Psi-Jack: not so; there are particular problems for example with GRUB and RAID devices for boot because GRUB doesn't have a module that can write to MD devices (read only so OK at boot-time)  - which causes problems in many scenarios for grub-install

[00:02:50] <TJ-> whole disk MD is fine for data devices
[00:03:16] <giuseppe_> SpeakerToMeat, and since RAID1 is on / partition grub is installed on both

[00:05:50] <TJ-> giuseppe_: you can easily check with "sudo file -s /dev/sda; sudo file -s /dev/sdb" output should be essentially identical
[00:05:51] <SpeakerToMeat> you'll need to use grub-install for that. by default on MBR it should go with HD0, you'll want to install to HD1 most possibly (if you do only have 2 drives in the machine, for reals)

[00:10:32] <Psi-Jack> 64 bytes for the 4 partitions. 🙂
[00:10:58] <SpeakerToMeat> TJ-, what about extended partitions?
[00:11:06] <hexnewbie> 64 bytes ought to be enough for anybody's partitions

[00:11:14] <giuseppe_> SpeakerToMeat, let's not take edge cases now
[00:11:22] <Psi-Jack> TJ-: "Extended partitions" are created within the partition containing them.
[00:11:34] <SpeakerToMeat> giuseppe_, I'm not talking about your case, what TJ- said should be enough to check
[00:11:54] <TJ-> Psi-Jack: no, *logical* partitions are created and contained within an Extended partition entry
[00:12:02] *** Joins: xet7 (~xet7@user/xet7)
[00:12:13] <SpeakerToMeat> TJ-, whole sector then? that explains the more relaxed restrictions (ammount wise)
[00:12:23] <hodapp> TJ- is right
[00:13:07] <TJ-> SpeakerToMeat: right; and weirdly, each sector (extended partition entry) is only supposed to contain 1 logical, and if more are needed, another extended partition with yet another sector, with a traditional limit of 127 such
[00:13:25] <hexnewbie> The entry is just an entry, the logical partitions are a linked list of partition tables within the extended partition itself
[00:13:41] <SpeakerToMeat> I wonder if this applies to 4K sectors as well. If anybody is using those with a MSDOS table that is
[00:13:52] <TJ-> so if you want 120 logical partitions, that isn't 120/4=30 sectors, it's 120 !
[00:14:04] <SpeakerToMeat> TJ-, sweet mother
[00:14:10] <TJ-> SpeakerToMeat: physical sector size doesn't enter into that, thankfully!
[00:14:25] <TJ-> SpeakerToMeat: MBR now only stores LBAs (logical block offsets)

[00:48:36] <Psi-Jack> It's generally better to do whole disk RAID, as multi-partition raid adds overhead to the RAID/HDD. If you want subvolumes/partitions within the RAID, layering LVM on the RAID itself is acceptable.

[07:37:15] <h2017> hi
[07:37:35] <h2017> should i be using qcow2 or lvm volumes for my vm's?
[07:37:45] <Psi-Jack> Depends.
[07:38:00] <iflema> jocker lap
[07:38:08] <ayecee> what does it depend on?
[07:38:19] <Psi-Jack> Too many things.
[07:38:33] <h2017> i like the simplicity of qcow2 for snapshots but it looks like you can get a approx 36% write improvement with lv's
[07:38:46] <h2017> whether that matters in the end is hard to say
[07:39:12] <ayecee> seems like a great thing to test to see if it matters in the end
[07:39:25] *** Joins: akoana (~ah@user/akoana)
[07:40:05] <h2017> and you can still do snapshots with lvm's but to do them right is slightly more complicated. you have to make sure that qemu agent stops you postgresql db's, flushes your mysql db's to disk and does and fs freeze before the lvm snapshot is taken

[08:22:34] <Dagmar> She's so cute it makes my wife jealous hehe
[08:22:47] <quartz> Kyv: Manjaro works for me only because I had issues with the latest Nvidia graphics drivers on Linux Mint. When I close the lid on my laptop and put it to sleep, than try to open it back up again, the screen would stay black. With Manjaro, that does not happen.
[08:23:02] <Psi-Jack> Well, Mint... explains a lot.
[08:23:04] <quartz> Which is weird, becuase I'm using the latest Nvidia drivers.... I literally can't figure out why it works with Manjaro
[08:23:26] <Psi-Jack> Linux Mint is literally Ubuntu, broken, and overlayed with custom crap that actually breaks more than benefits.
[08:23:35] <quartz> The same issue happens with my desktop computer.
[08:23:49] <Dagmar> Thats' a thing I'd report as a bug then
[08:23:49] <quartz> Psi-Jack: So it's ubuntus fault?
[08:23:53] <Psi-Jack> quartz: No.
[08:23:59] <Psi-Jack> it's literally Mint's.
[08:24:01] <Kyv> Mint is just fine.
[08:24:34] <Psi-Jack> The way Mint does their specific kernel management with version locking is part of the overall problem.
[08:24:47] <quartz> Dagmar: Yes, the morons at Linux Mint apparently thought it was a good idea to force upgrade everyone to the latest nvidia drivers. the 450 drivers worked fine, but the 460 and 465 don't. Oddly enough, the 465 drivers work great on Manjaro.

[08:26:00] <Kyv> I remember Mint having a utility which easily gives you the option to select what driver of several you want to use...
[08:26:20] <Kyv> So that driver is not an option anymore?
[08:26:24] <Dagmar> _Usually_ unless the deal is they are using radically different kernel, that's exactly the sort of thing that will have been annoying users of theirs who were in a position to fix it
[08:26:42] <Dagmar> ...and it'll have taken place on one of their indexed mailing lists.
[08:26:55] <quartz> Kyv: They do, but I could never select nvidia 450. Apparently the people on the linux mint forums said it was an issue with linux mint itself. You have to "manuall" install the nvidia 450 drivers.

[13:02:39] <hexnewbie> PHP had a stack overflow on 1 of this month, in the Firebird driver. Yeah, that doesn't mean it's a “security hole” in and of itself, but neither is Wordpress. It also gets the occasional CVE like most software, but they are fixed promptly.
[13:03:36] <schillingklaus> systemd is un-unixish bloatware, that's enough reason to replace it as soon as possible

[13:06:31] <DPA> Regarding the systemd dependency lockin problem, there already are variouse programs which will not work without systemd anymore at all right now, such as snap and cockpit. Some other programs at least still work with a stripped down fork (elogind).
[13:06:31] <DPA> Only very few programs have no systemd dependencies at all anymore, although quiet a few of those have it as an optional configure option.
[13:06:38] *** Joins: zhangxiaofei (~fzhan@111.203.234.210)
[13:07:01] <hexnewbie> Point is, systemd wouldn't get exploited in the wild. By contrast, I've seen bots target -- or even exploit -- the above. Exim attacks when the exim vulnerabilities were fixed earlier these month. Bash attacks through malicious user agents in 2014-15. Bare PHP + modules with no web applications.

[13:22:17] <hexnewbie> DPA: Short service file is usually simpler than simple init scripts (but higher learning curve), albeit modifying existing scripts (especially complex ones) is truly the problem which systemd's drop-in units and manual dependencies alleviate.

[16:19:27] <ananke> giuseppe_: not sure what you mean by 'separate raids for multiple partitions'. just lay raid1 across sda1 & sdb1
[16:20:13] <ananke> clearly it works, and it will be easier to identify what's on them
[16:20:22] <Psi-Jack> Yep, instead of doing sda1 for root, and sda2 for home, do sda1 for all, then lay LVM on that to split root and home up.
[16:20:56] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)

[20:13:58] <akk> (and the contract is secret, there was no public discussion or anything)
[20:14:17] <matse> ayecee: it didn't log anything... but I think that no module was being loaded since enabling the script

[21:46:36] <FLHerne> randomuser: If they have a reasonably long runtime and you don't care about running multiple instances or other applications at the same time, that should be fine
[21:47:11] <ayecee> randomuser: if the difference between the run times is large, then you won't need as much control over the environment to be confident in the results.
[21:47:28] <ayecee> randomuser: if the difference in run time is on the order of milliseconds, then this won't be adequate at all.
[21:47:37] <FLHerne> randomuser: It's possible that a program uses less wall-clock time but more CPU time [or memory space, or memory bandwidth, or disk throughput, or whatever]
[21:48:10] <ayecee> right, this only measures execution time and not any other factors, but i reckon that's what you're asking for.
[21:48:33] <FLHerne> but that doesn't matter if you're only running the one important task anyway
