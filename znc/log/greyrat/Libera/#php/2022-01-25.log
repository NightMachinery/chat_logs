[02:00:36] <sharpertool> Hi all. I'm supporting a site that is currently in production at php 7.2.34. We are replacing the site, but not for a while - you know how these things go, probably a year
[02:01:29] <sharpertool> Anyway, I'd like to run development with a newer PHP - mostly since it is easier to install newer versions. Is there a flag/option I can set that will have php 7.4 (or even 8.x) warn for language constructions that are NOT supported in 7.2? Kind of a compatibility mode?
[02:01:37] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:02:24] <__adrian> no
[02:02:26] <AllenJB> sharpertool: No, not in PHP itself. You can use static analysis tools or IDE language level support (in PHPStorm, possibly others) to achieve this.
[02:02:31] <Albright> Do you mean having 7.2 warn for constructs not supported in 7.4?
[02:02:50] <__adrian> i think the opposite
[02:02:57] <Blondie101010> I think he meant what he said, though the opposite would be more common
[02:03:05] <sharpertool> no.. not that. Have 7.4 warn for things beyond 7.2
[02:03:25] <__adrian> right. no. static analysis.
[02:03:34] <Byteflux> No, PHP doesn't have a "compatibility mode"
[02:03:34] <Albright> I don't get it. If 7.4 wasn't compatible with something in 7.2, it would just fail.
[02:03:42] <__adrian> Albright: opposite
[02:03:44] <sharpertool> Static analysis would work fine..
[02:03:49] <sharpertool> Was just wondering ;-)
[02:04:05] <noord> sharpertool: unit tests on critical paths may be useful
[02:04:16] <Byteflux> You probably want to make sure you read https://www.php.net/migration73 and https://www.php.net/migration74 before moving your code to 7.4
[02:04:36] <Blondie101010> or to do the opposite
[02:04:46] <Byteflux> Specifically the backwards incompatible changes.
[02:04:52] <__adrian> ^
[02:04:54] <sharpertool> I don't want to move the main code, just want the option to use the newer version for unit tests and debug.

[02:11:17] <Albright> Installing multiple versions with MacPorts is trivial.
[02:11:18] <Byteflux> VirtualBox isn't really a thing on M1 Macs
[02:11:18] <stenno> i used to use homebrew link to do my version management, but now just switched to docker too
[02:11:27] <eXtr3m0> I see
[02:11:39] <sharpertool> I've used that also. The bother was that I was trying to debug a "scratch" file in IntelliJ. It puts t hat files in a ~/Library path, and Docker was not find it. I did not put a ton of time into resolving that.. I am sure I'd have eventually..
[02:11:48] <znf> so if you're just echo-ing a $_POST['field'] back, what should one strip? strip_tags() should be enough?
[02:11:57] <Albright> You can also run PHP-FPM for more than one PHP version at once, and then use web server config to pick which one to use based on the path.
[02:12:00] <sharpertool> I literally just wanted a local version to run tests, unit tests, etc.
[02:12:28] <Byteflux> You could use Homebrew, yeah. You're able to install multiple versions of stuff using the @<version> syntax

[02:14:43] <sharpertool> Well, I do most development on a remote PHP, but, that's the main project. If you want to use the "scratch" files of IntelliJ, these are not part of the project, so they are not 'synced' over the the remote server.. that's why I started down this path.
[02:15:05] <Byteflux> IntelliJ also has trashy remote support
[02:15:21] <sharpertool> I did get the php 7.4 working with homebrew, so I can use that for doing scratch tests.. it's good enough for now.
[02:15:28] <Byteflux> In fact, IDEA stuff has crappy Docker support too, really.
[02:16:24] <Byteflux> Using different versions of PHP on Homebrew is literally `brew install php@7.2` and `brew install php@7.4` and you have two different versions living side by side.
[02:16:46] <Byteflux> Well, I don't actually know if Homebrew has 7.2 anymore.
[02:16:54] <sharpertool> you need to 'brew link php@7.4' to link one
[02:17:05] <__adrian> Albright: not sure which suggestion you thought i was referring to - i mean, running multiple php versions locally for dev. dev on a dev env is better, and easier to boot.
[02:17:05] <sharpertool> yeah, it's hard to install 7.2..
[02:17:10] <Byteflux> Sure, but linking is unnecessary if you're using an IDE
[02:17:19] <Byteflux> You invoke everything from within the IDE
[02:17:52] <Albright> __adrian: I mean installing PHP and stuff directly on a dev machine without Docker et al.
[02:17:53] <Byteflux> I'm very well aware you can configure multiple local interpreters with PhpStorm

[02:18:39] <__adrian> Albright: bare metal dev machine: sure
[02:18:48] <__adrian> most people don't have extra machines lying around though
[02:19:01] <sharpertool> I could pass $errors in as a reference. maybe that's better, but kind of wanted to avoid that..
[02:19:18] <sharpertool> wanted to avoid another line of code after each validate* routing also, if possible
[02:19:27] <Blondie101010> sharpertool: that kinda tells me you don't know list()
[02:19:31] <sharpertool> Am I just being crazy. here.
[02:19:34] <sharpertool> hehe..
[02:19:39] <__adrian> returning an array is fine
[02:19:43] <sharpertool> I'm a Python guy.. doing PHP, well, it's a job okay
[02:19:46] <Albright> sharpertool: Join the 21st century and create a TestResult object with $isVal and $errors parameters
[02:19:59] <__adrian> and name it isValid
[02:20:04] <sharpertool> I can do that also..
[02:20:15] <__adrian> or, $errors being empty would imply validity
[02:20:27] <Albright> list() is kind of a hack and definitely gives off a code smell.
[02:20:42] <Blondie101010> true
[02:20:45] <__adrian> > I'm a Python guy..  // he's thinking like tuples
[02:20:50] <__adrian> tuples are fine
[02:21:01] <sharpertool> It is possible a validation routing could return multiple errors. It's an age old problem. Validating some stuff. Do you return an error the first failure, or continue testing and return all errors..I'm doing the latter
[02:21:11] <__adrian> sure
[02:21:16] <__adrian> loop and collect
[02:21:26] <Albright> I've used them in Swift… there too they usually feel like "I should create a new object for this but I'm laaaaaazy"
[02:21:32] <__adrian> be aware that using oo code could simplfy this
[02:21:53] <sharpertool> I could create a TestResutls object and pass that in by reference.. But, inout params are, less desirable IMO
[02:22:02] <__adrian> no, backwards
[02:22:11] <sharpertool> Sure, I could make this a class and '$errors" is a class variable..
[02:22:35] <sharpertool> So, return TestResutls for each call. Then I'll have to "merge" those results after each call also.
[02:22:44] <__adrian> no. just append
[02:23:31] <sharpertool> Hmmm.. I could have a test stub that takes a validation function name, array of args, and then takes the result and appends to existingh results. That would avoid a lot of "test(..);merge...;" lines
[02:23:52] <sharpertool> maybe getting too fancy.
[02:23:54] <noord> sharpertool: a little bit duplication is ok
[02:24:06] <BadAdviceCat> if (something error'd) { $errors['this-thing-we-wanted-to-do-but-it-failed'] = 'Add this error to the list'; }
[02:24:08] <sharpertool> No!!!!
[02:24:11] <sharpertool> ;-)

[02:29:53] <sharpertool> If I pass a class instance, I do not need to pass by reference right? In that situation, I'm not changing the class instance variable, just the class itself.
[02:30:16] <wutzelputz> objects are always passed by reference afaik
[02:30:17] <__adrian> (a) no (b) i'm not suggesting you passa class instance.
[02:30:21] <Blondie101010> object instances are unique
[02:30:24] <__adrian> ^
[02:30:30] <__adrian> they are not references though.
[02:30:37] <Blondie101010> so close
[02:31:00] <__adrian> only in the most obvious aspects of their behavior.
[02:31:22] <__adrian> not in the details, nor in how they're implemented. object instances are more like resources.
[02:31:39] <Blondie101010> ahh
[02:31:55] <__adrian> "do you need to pass objects by reference?" no, because they already behave that way, wrt what you're thinking of.
[02:32:17] <wutzelputz> __adrian: not sure i got a knowledge gap there: objects are basically passed around like pointers in c right? (or references in c++)
[02:32:21] <__adrian> no
[02:32:34] <__adrian> objects have ids (like resources do), and you pass those around.
[02:33:18] <__adrian> the object id is conceptually (not literally) a "pointer" or "reference" (or "label" or "key" or whatever) to the actual object.
[02:33:25] <Blondie101010> wutzelputz:  the result of a reference assignment becomes a reference, but if you assign an object to a variable, it gets the object ID
[02:33:36] <__adrian> ^
[02:33:55] <sharpertool> Hehe.. when were Interfaces added to the langauge?
[02:34:12] <__adrian> and from there, it doesn't matter if the $object (which is actually just an int id) is a reference or not, as that doesn't change anything.
[02:34:32] <__adrian> all &$object means is you learned oop in php 4 and never followed up
[02:34:46] <__adrian> sharpertool: long time ago, not sure
[02:34:58] <wutzelputz> huuuh interesting. it seems like a subtle difference. i'd be glad to fully understand this. is there a code example that highlights the difference? (tbh i've gotten through almost 15 years of paid php development without even noticing that difference and i'm rly curious)
[02:35:29] <__adrian> most obvious code example would be to pass an object by ref and not by ref and observe that nothing different happens
[02:35:37] <__adrian> !+lies
[02:35:37] <php-bot> Objects are *not* references, read http://bit.ly/hpUAci and/or https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/RFCs/001.txt

[02:35:38] <Blondie101010> lol
[02:36:38] <wutzelputz> __adrian: so in the context of object there is no observable difference? (i'm aware that theres a difference for arrays and regular value-types)

[02:39:19] <noord> isn't it pass by value by default so what is the problem?
[02:40:14] <wutzelputz> sharpertool: glad if it helped. i'm sure you can figure out the interface for Error by yourself :D good look and happy programming!
[02:40:27] <__adrian> "pass by value" makes people think "maybe my changes to the object won't be preserved."
[02:40:48] * wutzelputz sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/e4fd94f1138c90d8cd8b448be39ec4ae70526f26
[02:41:01] <__adrian> thing is, $object is not actually the object. it's the object id. this is passed by value, but it would make no difference if it were passed by reference.
[02:41:05] <wutzelputz>  * ```<?php... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/407dc17b39b3b3111fd0c57afde29d25a89d7680)
[02:41:11] <__adrian> because in both cases, it's simply used to find the object you want.
[02:43:11] <wutzelputz> __adrian: i know this is getting into the details of the implementation, but does that mean whenever i call a function on an object in PHP it first has to resolve the objectId that is the variable to then find out which type it is to then call the method?
[02:47:15] <__adrian> yes
[02:47:41] <__adrian> (though that was true even before the php5-redesigned-objects)

[02:48:09] <__adrian> methods, consts, etc. aren't duplicated to the instance. that would be foolishly watseful  :)
[02:48:53] <wutzelputz> gotta love how a hack this audacious can hide this well in plain sight for someone just using the langugage:D
[02:49:09] <wutzelputz> s/langugage/language /
[02:49:51] <__adrian> not sure i'd rate it a hack at all, much less "audacious"  :)
[02:51:46] <wutzelputz> didnt mean any insults, i just started developing more in c++ recently in some fun projects and there the world is.... lets say much more rigid ^^
[02:52:34] <wutzelputz> by audacious i meant something along the lines of "the devs got away with not actually doing references"
[02:54:10] <wutzelputz> (which is imo really cool and admirable considering that so many people including me got hooked to the way PHP handles this kind of problems)

[03:06:26] <ProfSimm> Let's add a new cleaner syntax for PHP with a new opening tag. It'll be totally compatible with existing PHP code. You can mix both
[03:06:42] <ProfSimm> <?np  <-- new php
[03:08:20] <znf> how would that be compatible with existing php code?

[03:40:31] <TML> znf: I didn't see you mention that you needed ipv6
[03:40:49] <znf> sorry I literally do not recall the question I asked hours ago :D
[03:41:23] <TML> You mentioned that ip2long() doesn't work with ipv6, and I said "I didn't see you mention that you needed ipv6"
[03:41:30] <TML> nothing to recall beyond that
[03:46:19] <Blondie101010> ip2long can not logically represent a 128 bit number unless you have a 128bit CPU and OS
[03:46:48] <TML> Well…
[03:47:22] <Blondie101010> perhaps with long long implementations or similar
[03:48:08] <TML> It's really a question of the size of your "long" type, so 1) Even if you had a "128bit CPU and OS", you might still find that the "long" type is not a 128 bit type, and; 2) You could have a 32bit OS on a 32bit CPU that chooses to represent a long as 4 32bit words, in which
[03:48:29] <Blondie101010> sure
[03:48:43] <TML> case you'd just need to implement the logic for ipv6 in long2ip()
[03:49:37] <TML> Could easily get there through a combination of pack and inet_ntop

[17:16:38] <AllenJB> There are a number of reasons people might not use PHP for templating - specifically some people don't want a templating language that gives access to the full power of a scripting language. Some want a templating language that's usable with other languages / platforms.
[17:17:02] <AllenJB> There's nothing stopping you doing what you suggest, but web components already fulfill that role and aren't tied to PHP.
[17:17:09] <jwpapi> And I could make it all part of a class and that way I would have a class that contains all my design elements.  And on my page I write `myTheme.button()`
[17:17:11] <Naktibalda> I'm sure that many form and template libraries have button method
[17:17:21] <jwpapi> AllenJB: What is web components?

[17:18:53] <AllenJB> Web components allow you to create custom elements - reusable components that include HTML/DOM, CSS and JS - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components
[17:20:24] <jwpapi> But then I either have to use a bundler to create my HTML page or the page needs to download JS which decreases the loading time or?

[17:22:39] <AllenJB> Depends what you're doing - in most cases I would say the impact is negligible. Especially when you consider people are using commonly using massive JS frameworks and designing blogs as SPAs.
[17:25:07] <jwpapi> I’m currently working on a wordpress website and I keep coding pages and it’s a bit tough to maintain with utility CSS. I would like to have each element defined once.
[17:25:31] <jwpapi> I could use templating with JS and just generate my PHP/HTML websites locally
[17:25:54] <rb> you could totally set up a utility function
[17:26:26] <rb> i think wordpress allows you to inject global functions at runtime from themes, so you could just make those functions in your theme and use them

[17:34:20] <jwpapi> and it will generate a cacheable HTML Page in the end

[17:42:08] <__adrian> jwpapi: using php as a templating engine is common - almost everybody does it. it usually looks more like "<button>" than `button()`.

[17:42:22] <Naktibalda> wordpress 4.1 is very specific, so this graph was created between December 2014 and April 2015
[17:42:31] <TinoDidriksen> Wordpress 4.1 that it references is from Dec 2014, so pretty old yes.
[17:42:33] <BadAdviceCat> In spite of that, I believe it's still relevant. https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/search?l=PHP&q=global
[17:43:31] <jwpapi>  I didn’t want to discuss here if Wordpress is still relevant
[17:43:37] <jwpapi> or a good choice as a CMS
[17:44:37] <Naktibalda> 15 years ago I had a colleague who created HTML abstraction in Delphi, by creating a Delphi class for every HTML tag.
[17:46:52] <jwpapi> To do something like this is fine or not? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/GLGspAiJ/
[17:47:15] <__adrian> it's a lot of extra work to make something fairly error-prone
[17:47:24] <__adrian> just write normal html templates
[17:47:29] <Naktibalda> jwpapi: how exactly is it better than HTML doing the same?
[17:47:54] <jwpapi> _ I’m using utility CSS instead of semantic one
[17:48:00] <Naktibalda> <button class="large">SINGN ME UP!</button>
[17:48:07] <__adrian> what?
[17:48:07] <eXtr3m0> I wrote an HTML abstraction in XSLT. I love it, I just write very very basic html files and have a feature rich responsive website. e.g. I provide 1 image path and it creates 80 options for the browsers automatically. ez

[17:49:23] <jwpapi> TinoDidriksen: tailwind-css
[17:49:41] <BadAdviceCat> jwpapi, I'm not discussing that. I am only talking about code quality that is relevant to the topic that you've brought up here. I am saying that Wordpress doesn't meet the criteria. You're expecting an easier time working with code "it's a bit tough to maintain", but that's not going to happen here.
[17:49:42] <__adrian> jwpapi: what's that got to do with your php questions, at all?
[17:50:21] <jwpapi> __adrian: using utility  css classes I realized that when I want to change my button I have to change it at multiple spots
[17:50:26] <jwpapi> or for all elements
[17:50:31] <BadAdviceCat> Others here already pointed out that there is nothing stopping you from creating a function such as `MYTHEME.button(size,link)`
[17:50:36] <jwpapi> If i create a templating class I’ll only have to do it at one spot.
[17:51:00] <jwpapi> BadAdviceCat: Okay when you say there is nothing stopping me, you mean it’s fine to do so
[17:51:12] <__adrian> he means there's nothing stopping you  ;)
[17:51:24] <__adrian> not that "it's a fine idea"
[17:54:06] <jwpapi> that’s what I’m asking tho
[17:54:11] <jwpapi> Is there something I’m missing?
[17:54:17] <jwpapi> I’m looking to write good code
[17:54:28] <jwpapi> not code that does what I want to do in that case
[17:54:31] <__adrian> "just write normal html templates"
[17:54:39] <lembron> then dont, its nothing you have any win from in reality on the end
[17:54:57] <jwpapi> again that way I have defined the design of a button in multiple spots.
[17:55:35] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, Tailwind is simply invalid CSS syntax, and they have no plans on fixing that. How awful.

[17:57:23] <lembron> may seem like a smart idea while its just you hacking around in your 500-line index.php | but quickly breaks away once you want to actually "build" anything and end up having that button function take 15 different args, where just writing the html in the first place be simpler

[17:58:19] <BadAdviceCat> jwpapi, definitely not a fine idea. Your idea of PHP as a template engine seems odd to me. The way I see things, PHP is an easy way to re-use HTML templates via include/require. Not use PHP for the for the sole purpose to define functions specifically to generate a button and such in a manner done like this: https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/01e2180daadb4225abf6f866289a5927
[17:59:14] <jwpapi> Ok then doing what I just sent is a better idea

[18:02:55] <jwpapi> I don’t see what’s the problem of you guys here. I generally use communities to learn more about good code style. And I came up with this idea of Templating in PHP, but I also have not seen it before, that’s why I reached out here and asked why __adrian
[18:03:15] <lembron> OT but, on that irccloud snap -- is it me or is that sentence HORRIBLE to read? :D https://i.imgur.com/bR28QlW.png is better?
[18:03:16] <jwpapi> And it just repeats of what HTML is for
[18:03:49] <lembron> needed like a quadrupel take to digest that...
[18:04:05] <Tach> OK fixed
[18:04:21] <jwpapi> and I implemented utility CSS, but then repeated myself, because often utility css is used with components like in React, where you don’t have that problem of duplication.
[18:04:54] <jwpapi> For me it seems to avoid duplication the proposed way of tailwind is better than to do this with PHP
[18:04:56] <__adrian> jwpapi: yes, that is what html is for. if you want to know about better code practices, then listen: no this. use html templates. re-creating html in php functions is a foolish, counter-productive waste of time. you get something that is harder to use, less flexible, and easier to mess up.
[18:05:14] <__adrian> and again: none of this has anything to do with css
[18:05:44] <jwpapi> __adrian: Thank you I’m taking your advice
[18:05:45] <__adrian> you can do semantic css in html templates, or in your idea of php templates. it not a factor here.
[18:06:40] <jwpapi> But my biggest duplication problem is tons of semantic css classes
[18:06:40] <__adrian> i'm not saying you have to follow my advice  :)  just that, if you ask for it, listen to the answers. in the end, you can make your choices.
[18:06:58] <jwpapi> I try to listen to your answers, where did I make the impression that I didn’t listen?
[18:07:11] <jwpapi> my duplication problem is the utility css classes I mean
[18:07:19] <__adrian> why?
[18:07:50] <__adrian> make your <button> template, included it where needed.
[18:08:04] <__adrian> "html templates" ≠ "one single huge template with everything"
[18:08:16] <jwpapi> what do you mean by html templates?
[18:08:22] <__adrian> html
[18:08:24] <jwpapi> like a separate file?
[18:08:41] <__adrian> like  <button class="cta"><?= $text ?></button>
[18:08:45] <__adrian> yes
[18:08:59] <__adrian> if you put them all in one file, not much of a template
[18:08:59] <jwpapi> so semantic css is it what you’re suggesting
[18:09:04] <__adrian> ...
[18:09:11] <jwpapi> `.cta` defines the look of the button
[18:09:22] <jwpapi> my button looks like this
[18:09:24] <jwpapi> 			<button class="CTA hover:bg-gold-light focus:bg-gold-light bg-gold text-black mt-8 py-4 px-16 text-xl md:text-3xl font-bold uppercase font-bold mb-4 rounded inline-block mx-auto drop-shadow-lg">
[18:09:25] <__adrian> no, it defines the role
[18:09:34] <__adrian> yeah, that's not sematic at all
[18:09:39] <jwpapi> so when I want to change the design of the buttons on my website I have to change that 10 times
[18:09:40] <__adrian> that's declarative
[18:09:48] <jwpapi> I would like to have a single spot to change the design
[18:09:54] <__adrian> that's fine
[18:10:06] <__adrian> "a single spot to change the design" is not "sematic css."
[18:10:10] <__adrian> it's "templates"
[18:10:21] <jwpapi> I’m missing something here
[18:10:27] <jwpapi> but each button has a different text
[18:10:41] <__adrian> semantic css is using css classnames that _mean_ something, as opposed to describing the css rule they implement.
[18:10:52] <jwpapi> ahhh ok that’s my erro
[18:10:55] <jwpapi> r
[18:11:13] <__adrian> e.g.,  class="important"  vs.  class="font-weight-bold"
[18:11:22] <jwpapi> Ok where are you suggesting I define the design?
[18:11:41] <__adrian> "semantic css": yes, good idea. it has nothing to do with how you make your templates or if you use php.
[18:12:04] <jwpapi> How do I make my templates. I don’t understand
[18:12:29] <jwpapi> When you say templates I think of making a file that is called `button.html` and then include this on the page where I want to use it.
[18:12:35] <__adrian> start with the html structure you want. break it into parts. like  "button-cta"  or "main-content"
[18:12:46] <__adrian> basically, yes
[18:13:14] <jwpapi> but than I wouldn’t know how to display different text in it , so I would then make a `button.php` that takes an argument
[18:13:23] <jwpapi> text for example
[18:13:30] <__adrian> you'd use <?= $variables ?>
[18:13:49] <jwpapi> yes
[18:13:56] <jwpapi> let me scribble what I would do
[18:15:43] <jwpapi> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/tlnTx33u/
[18:16:29] <lembron> jwpapi but i need a onClick action on this one...
[18:16:40] <lembron> and a style="" on the one before...
[18:16:45] <jwpapi> and then on the actual page I would do `include('buttons.php`);` and later `<?=button('text')?>`
[18:17:08] <lembron> and tomorrow were gonna implement aria-tags :P
[18:17:52] <jwpapi> __adrian: I don’t understand what’s the difference between html templates and ”re-creating HTML in PHP functions“
[18:18:55] <jwpapi> https://css-tricks.com/php-templating-in-just-php/ is this bad?
[18:19:58] <lembron> if you make it button($text, $onClick, $aria) to fullfil my need youre walking down a long dark road :D --- if you do button($optionsArray) to then button(array('text'=>'..', 'onClick'...)))) you are pretty much back to the start, nwo needing a templating for your php :D
[18:20:27] <jwpapi> lembron: I can make an <a> tag around it
[18:20:28] <jwpapi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/jAoQ5GNN/image.png
[18:21:55] <jwpapi> ^This honestly seems like the best solution to me.  CSS is defined in the style file. Using @apply of utility classes secures design consistency. HTML is used for markup and PHP for dynamically creating content.

[18:24:48] <jwpapi> okay thank you
[18:25:34] <jwpapi> I don’t exactly know what you mean by html templates and how that is different to what I sent, but my initial problem is solved by the solution proposed by tailwind

[18:26:37] <__adrian> that's a template.
[18:27:12] <BadAdviceCat> jwpapi, I wanted to publish this sooner, but the paste.gg decided to hiccup with error code 500. https://paste.ofcode.org/fLF8dG52hRgmDh9KGSrZCD <-- This is the ideal way one should use PHP to do templates. Then use CSS to change/alter the color/size of buttons.
[18:27:56] <jwpapi> Ok good
[18:27:58] <BadAdviceCat> 3 files. footer and header in the templates folder. Then index.php.
[18:27:58] <jwpapi> I understand
[18:28:05] <jwpapi> That’s fine I do that
[18:28:46] <jwpapi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/oa7kJTbs/image.png
[18:29:59] <jwpapi> If I have something like this. How would you do that
[18:30:05] <jwpapi> Let me propose you two options
[18:31:48] <jwpapi> https://gist.github.com/e575816ace7e4d434d20e1a1dab4f6ac Option 1
[18:34:36] <jwpapi> https://gist.github.com/JWPapi/02704216c8bc694596937a8fb3109bce Option 2
[18:34:55] <jwpapi> not sure why the indent ist wrong
[18:36:29] <jwpapi> BadAdviceCat: __adrian
[18:41:41] <BadAdviceCat> It doesn't have to only be 3 files. You can split and break templates into smaller/reusable pieces. For example: https://paste.ofcode.org/KAaQNeBkKAg7YkyBxwAAKe
[18:42:20] <BadAdviceCat> I would adopt the Directory Structure. :D
[18:43:26] <jwpapi> that doesn’t really answer my question tho
[18:44:33] <BadAdviceCat> jwpapi, go with the first option, or use Partials.
[18:45:34] <BadAdviceCat> Or even better: Don't do this in PHP and make use of something like ReactJS for example.
[18:49:39] <BadAdviceCat> jwpapi, by Partials, this is what I mean: http://chadminick.com/articles/simple-php-template-engine.html <-- Use this template engine class, and then do $view->render('templates/partials/grid-card.php');
[18:51:23] <BadAdviceCat> Alternatively, You can use https://twig.symfony.com/ or https://platesphp.com/ to do the same thing as the Template class example.
[18:51:46] <jwpapi> plates look good to me thanks
[18:52:19] <jwpapi> article is offline
[18:52:52] <jwpapi> wordpress particular has something like this
[18:53:04] <jwpapi> I should stick with this if in in wordpress environtment
[18:54:09] <BadAdviceCat> This approach is much more flexible compared to Option #2, because you do not have to keep creating functions for each Front end framework Component (e.g. Making a function just to echo out a Card, A button, chips, menus, lists, sliders, etc.)
[18:54:41] <BadAdviceCat> jwpapi, here: https://web.archive.org/web/20170917133705/http://chadminick.com/articles/simple-php-template-engine.html
[18:55:10] <BadAdviceCat> That was what I meant to publish, but yea, plates is great :D
[18:56:42] <jwpapi> I’m using twig with symfony
[18:57:51] <BadAdviceCat> I like using this feature in Twig. https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/filters/spaceless.html
[18:58:11] <BadAdviceCat> Just {% apply spaceless %}The Entire Webpage{% endapply %}
[18:58:54] <BadAdviceCat> Why? Because it does a good job solving this specific problem: https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/
[19:00:27] <BadAdviceCat> Then we will not need to use float hacks, and similar hacks to get around the ancient HTML bug.
[19:01:57] <BadAdviceCat> ReactJS automatically solves this problem.
[19:02:49] <chazy> if i need different dependencies for a controller depending on the route, should i have a constructor for each case where i can inject the dependencies? or is it ok to instantiate inside methods?
[19:04:02] <Naktibalda> chazy: it looks like you should have different controllers
[19:06:38] <chazy> hmm, yeah it's possible, but i remember seeing classes with different constructors, are those bad designed?
[19:06:47] <Naktibalda> that's impossible
[19:06:59] <BadAdviceCat> chazy, my approach is different: Don't use the controller for the purpose of performing the task the End User wants. Instead, delegate that task to another class. Controllers should not be doing anything more than to *Translate HTTP request into an instruction that has nothing to do with HTTP, something your app can use and understand without HTTP being involved in any way shape or form*.
[19:07:00] <Naktibalda> in PHP
[19:08:03] <chazy> Naktibalda: you mean PHP doesn't allow multiple constructors?
[19:08:15] <Naktibalda> yep, it doesn't
[19:08:40] <BadAdviceCat> For example. Do not put code inside the Controller that allows the end user to Publish a message/blog/create/open an account. Etc.
[19:09:40] <BadAdviceCat> One IMO should do this instead: Have the controller read the $_POST/$_GET data, and then pass this task onto a different object. Then optionally, wait for the object to return a value to send back over HTTP.
[19:09:43] <chazy> so when a user wants to create a resource, where do i put the code if not in a controller?

[19:21:00] <olle> judah: Sure!
[19:22:56] <BadAdviceCat> In this case, dependencies. You can try this approach for example. https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html - Injecting the messageBus into the controller. Then take the data out of the Request variable, put that into the Message, then pass that message object to the $messageBus.
[19:23:35] <BadAdviceCat> Then the Handler will do the actual Resource creation and so on.
[19:24:31] <BadAdviceCat> You can also validate messages using Symfony Validator, it's also explained on that very page on how to.

[19:27:09] <php-bot> An excellent way to deal with Cross-cutting concerns. Rather than decorating command buses, consider using the middleware approach, see this example for details https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/messenger.html

[19:56:49] <stenno> hi
[19:56:59] <BadAdviceCat> Basically, it seems to be about shoe-horning a whole pattern, design or idea, and then trying to blanket apply it to the software. The software will still have the same problem that these "problem solving approaches" attempts to solve, but the problem is not solved and it is instead Moved somewhere else where it STILL remains the problem.
[19:57:07] <Rockwood_> what happed with bikes :D
[19:57:19] <BadAdviceCat> shoe-horning approaches on how to solve x problem.
[19:57:36] <olle> BadAdviceCat: hm
[19:57:38] <BadAdviceCat> I've seen this with various "MVC" approaches.
[19:57:56] <stenno> mvc :/
[19:58:06] <BadAdviceCat> OH NOES! FAT CONTROLLERS BAD! PUT THE CODE IN THE MODEL INSTEAD <--- Problem is still there.
[19:58:06] <olle> I think the point is, however you structure your code, *something* will be cross-cutting it.
[19:58:31] <olle> So it should be adapted to the most common change request
[19:58:43] <olle> If you can see into the future... Which you kind of can, when you're working in a known domain.

[19:59:11] <BadAdviceCat> Which is why I like the MessageBus approach to deal with the problem.
[20:00:06] <olle> BadAdviceCat: Pipe architecture, right?
[20:00:14] <BadAdviceCat> Can also have events send emails and what not. As with many solutions, don't think it's a perfect silver bullet and the solution on works for the problem it is set out to solve (meaning, you can't blanket apply it everywhere)

[20:01:09] <olle> Yes, I like it, too. Never got the chance to apply it. And probably never will. :) Legacy code, yo.
[20:02:14] <BadAdviceCat> I've found this: https://web.archive.org/web/20150919015041/http://www.aosd.net/wiki/index.php?title=Glossary - Scroll to "Dominant Decomposition" this explains it well.
[20:02:47] *** Quits: mooz (~none@23.254.112.158) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:02:50] <BadAdviceCat> I came across that page from here: https://agile-aspects.michaelmahlberg.com/2007/06/dictatorship-of-dominant-decomposition.html original links are dead, but one can wayback-machine it.
[20:04:19] <olle> Anyway, "scattering" is important, because it links incoming change requests to your architecture.
[20:04:35] <olle> Scattered architecture --> one change request affects multiple modules/classes/units
[20:05:11] <olle> In the ideal case, each CR (change request) affects exactly one software unit. So there's a one-to-one relation.
[20:06:10] <BadAdviceCat> chazy, if you need to send an email after performing a Handling a message/UseCase... Don't send email there. It would be a good idea to instead use an event. For example, after user creating their account, it triggers the "AccountCreated" event which triggers other handlers (SendEmailWhenUserSignsUpEventHandler  for example
[20:06:22] <BadAdviceCat> There is a great talk on that stuff.
[20:08:26] <olle> Events can make it a bit harder to follow the flow, tho
[20:09:03] <BadAdviceCat> Here is how you would know what to separate out. On the condition that (1)  it feels like a "Side Quest" that is not absolutely technically needed to "Create account"  or perform the task the End user wants to do, and (2) These are tasks that needs to run after use case, then the code goes there into event handler.
[20:10:20] <olle> A benefit is you can add features without touching old code.

[22:56:01] <__adrian> classes are for grouping related functions with data. for example a class might be a "thing" (say, a User) or a concept (like a process, say, an Emailer)
[22:56:03] <olle> 1: Introduction To OOP PHP | Object Oriented PHP Tutorial For Beginners | PHP Tutorial | mmtuts
[22:56:04] <__adrian> an instance of a class is an object
[22:56:07] <__adrian> classes will have methods, which are things the object can "do" - for example, $user->changePassword($new_password) or $emailer->addCC($email)
[22:56:10] <__adrian> classes will also have properties, which is where the data is stored. like  $user->joinDate  or  $emailer->subject
[22:56:21] <olle> Now you're just copy-pasting old stuff, __adrian xD

[22:56:42] <__adrian> it's new stuff
[22:56:43] <__adrian> :)
[22:57:23] <__adrian> FightingFalcon: beyond that, my recommendation is to choose a "thing" to make a class about and give it a try. Think of a name, then think of actions that you'd want to do with it.
[22:57:51] <FightingFalcon> yes i will try that i guess

[23:40:30] <judah> I shoot for 75%, but the important thing is to always be improving. The last 20% or so will be real difficult to get covered anyways
[23:41:27] <judah> Also, code coverage does not work if your test suit uses data providers. Learned this the hard way. The data providers run before the tests start so they are not included in the coverage results.
[23:45:58] <olle> There was this guy saying to only unit-test behaviour, that corresponds to the actual spec of a piece of code
[23:46:08] <olle> I'm not sure tho
[23:46:25] <olle> judah: Hm
[23:47:47] <judah> There are different lines of thought for testing. Any piece of code externally exposed really should be tested. This could be a web endpoint, an API, interfaces, etc
[23:48:13] <judah> That does not mean you shouldnt test internal code though
[23:49:20] <judah> The important part of tests isnt getting a green checkmark. The real benefit of having them is the safety they provide, so you can make changes and ensure that expected behavior does not also change. This makes code cleanup and refactoring much safer.
