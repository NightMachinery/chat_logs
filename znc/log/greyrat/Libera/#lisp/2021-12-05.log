[01:07:54] <Catie> Oh yeah, AutoCAD system variables are all C-based, so they need numeric values instead of Lisp values. So (setvar "CMDECHO" nil) will fail, but (setvar "CMDECHO" 0) is okay

[01:30:15] <Catie> Path errors are really hard to diagnose, it's no worries! And AutoCAD doesn't exactly make it easy for us
[01:31:27] <bjorkintosh> i thought (silly me), that wherever your .lsp file was, it'd look there for your .dcl file.
[01:32:27] <bjorkintosh> so I'd created c:\Lisp\psilisp as my playground. nothing to do with .dcl worked. turns out it just wanted to be in the main lisp directory.

[01:33:19] <bjorkintosh> it also wasn't obvious because I'd created other *.lsp files in psilisp which run fine, but did not invoke dcl.

[01:34:19] <bjorkintosh> Catie, do you have a recommended autolisp book?
[01:34:43] <Catie> Shucks, let me find the ones I used
[01:34:45] <bjorkintosh> I've got a few here. always happy to add to the pile of unreads.
[01:35:17] <bjorkintosh> also, do you ever delve into the autocad database?
[01:35:24] <bjorkintosh> or create things using entmake?
[01:35:28] <Catie> I know I read "A B Cs of AutoLISP", but there was one more I can't remember the title of
[01:36:07] <Catie> I use entmake and entmod a decent bit. Most of what I've done has been executing commands in different dynamic environments
[01:36:30] <bjorkintosh> aha. can you name an entity with something friendlier than the hexcode it spits out?
[01:36:56] <Catie> Nope. That's its handle, which is internal to AutoCAD
[01:36:58] <bjorkintosh> like leftline, instead of <3b32>
[01:37:00] <bjorkintosh> oh.
[01:37:30] <bjorkintosh> so what I have in mind might not be possible afterall.
[01:37:34] <Catie> You can try to give it a name by using one of the string-typed user-reserved DXF codes
[01:38:05] <Catie> But be really careful with that, if you stuff the wrong datatype into a DXF code it can segfault the program
[01:38:33] <bjorkintosh> oh.
[01:39:03] <Catie> AutoCAD doesn't have very good support for associating semantic information with entities, though many people have worked around it in their own ways

[01:39:43] <bjorkintosh> so what I'm trying to do is this. I'm creating a bunch of lines and arcs. at some point, I have to fillet two lines. I don't want to do it automatically.
[01:40:08] <bjorkintosh> take leftline and thatotherlin and join them in unholy matrimony.
[01:40:11] <bjorkintosh> something of the sort.

[01:41:56] <Catie> FILLET expects two points as input, so if you have the entity lists for both lines handy you can get the endpoints of both lines, and pass them to FILLET like (command "fillet" first-endpoint second-endpoint)
[01:43:56] <bjorkintosh> yes. but it changes each time I open autocad
[01:44:44] <bjorkintosh> I can't exactly tell which line is which ahead of time.
[01:45:33] <Catie> When the time comes to do the fillet, how are you determining which ones to do? Are they always in the same place, are they passed as input to a function?
[01:46:09] <bjorkintosh> they're always in the same place. I select them with the mouse and then run the command.
[01:47:02] <Catie> If they're in a constant location, you can hard-code points into your code. If you want to select them with a mouse, (entget (car (entsel))) has been my go-to
[01:47:36] <bjorkintosh> hmm I see.
[01:48:02] <bjorkintosh> I'll play around with it and see. my big headache was dcl.
[01:48:18] <bjorkintosh> we're only allowed AutoCAD 2000 at work. it suits our needs
[01:48:32] <bjorkintosh> but it seems a tad limited.
[01:49:06] <Catie> What I've done in the past is written the function that does all the work as taking the entities as input and doing all the work with them, then writing a wrapper command around them that iterates over a selection set with SSGET and passes each entity to the main function
[01:49:52] <bjorkintosh> that could work.
[01:49:56] <bjorkintosh> I'll try it and see.
[01:50:01] <Catie> Yeah, good luck!

[19:17:46] <edgar-rft> sirquack: Lisp has a long history and a bewildering number of dialects, but most of them are only interesting for software archaeologogists :-) The main Lisp dialects used in 2021 are Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure. This reduces the number of dialects to compare a bit :-)
[19:18:29] <wasamasa> you forgot elisp
[19:19:25] <jackdaniel> sirquack: for popularity go after clojure, for aesthetics go after racket, for expresiveness go after common lisp
[19:19:33] <jackdaniel> for text editing go after elisp :-)

[19:20:18] <jackdaniel> have fun!
[19:20:37] <edgar-rft> Common Lisp is great for big and complex projects, Scheme is mainly used by language experimentators, Clojure is useful if you want acess to the Java ecosystem, and Elisp is a scripting language for configuring the Emacs editor :-)
[19:22:09] <contrapunctus> Someone mention Clojure? https://reddit.com/comments/qnlpt6
[19:24:43] <shroomreactionar> Scheme is the most based and, it is a good place to start. "The Little Schemer" is great. (And "The Little Lisper" for CL)

[22:21:44] <random-nick> I don't think paip is usually recommended as a introduction to cl, but it does have an introduction to CL in the beginning
[22:22:17] <random-nick> but yes pcl is usually the goto recommendation for programmers wanting to learn cl

[22:29:10] <lisp123> Issue is that the standard has undefined behaviour

[22:29:34] <LMM> that's the problem with the standard
[22:29:59] <lisp123> Not really, specifying too much hamstrungs implementors to choose the best approach - its a balance
[22:30:02] <LMM> it was too easy an out "UNDEFINED"
[22:31:44] <lisp123> LMM: It's a hard question
[22:32:04] <LMM> we have something between CLtL1 and 2 and I haven't found any description of what changed between 2 and ANSII
[22:32:20] <LMM> i know a lot more about standards-making now
[22:33:14] <lisp123> THere's stuff online on the differences
[22:33:30] <lisp123> google stack overflow differences between cltl2 and ansi common lisp, and you should get something
[22:33:59] <LMM> not useful one-off answers
[22:34:15] <LMM> i thought i stayed with X3J13 until it closed

[23:04:56] <edgar-rft> Interlisp is a predecessor of Common Lisp, what means it is *different* from Common Lisp. According to the project page the goal is "Restoring and Preserving the Interlisp experience". Making Interlisp Common Lisp compatible violates this goal. I fail to understand how this could be useful.
[23:06:05] *** Joins: karlosz (~karlosz@47.151.136.69)
[23:07:07] <LMM______> The Medley Interlisp implemeentation is also a full Common Lisp implementation, and most of the development environment tuned to work with both
[23:07:19] <jcowan> Medley supports both IL and CL and has for many years
[23:07:34] <LMM______> the "dialects" are mainly just setting *package* and *readtable*
[23:07:50] <jcowan> It's CLtL1, though much work has been done to getting it to ansi.
[23:08:13] <il> I have been pinged
[23:08:17] <il> How's it going
[23:08:35] <lisp123> lol
[23:08:39] <jcowan> I think that using Medley to develop CL would make a lot of sense, and then deploying on SBCL
[23:09:02] <jcowan> (sorry, il; IL = Interlisp)
[23:09:28] <il> jcowan, oh, no worries, it's entirely my fault
[23:09:38] <edgar-rft> Then I obviously fail to understand why the project goal is "Restoring and Preserving the Interlisp experience".
[23:10:07] <LMM______> Interlisp wasn't a language,, it was a Way of Life
[23:10:20] <il> teach me da wae
[23:11:12] <jcowan> Development was aimed at the "IDE" rather than the language itself
[23:12:08] <jcowan> the difference being that unlike modern so-called IDEs, Medley is *really* integreted

[23:13:41] <LMM______> honestly, it's a lot of badly-written code too
[23:13:46] <jcowan> also, CL owes almost nothing to Interlisp outside the shared inheritance; the only thing I know of is (car nil) = (cdr nil) = nil.

[23:14:38] <LMM______> jcowan i disagree -- i think cl inherited more from interlisp than generally acknowledged
[23:15:15] <lisp123> jcowan: That in itself is worth a lot :) nil as a list is SO helpful
[23:15:28] <jcowan> e.g.?  (Not that I doubt you.)
[23:15:58] <jcowan> NIL is a list, yes, but imao allowing it to be a cons as well is bad style
[23:16:15] <LMM______> nil isn't a CONS

[23:21:47] <pdietz> CL got SORT from Interlisp.   It should have been NSORT.
[23:22:14] <macaw> pdietz: Would have funny typos, but I agree. ;)
[23:22:45] <pdietz> Oh, a SORT would also have been fine.  It would be nondestructive.
[23:24:13] <pdietz> I agree allowing CAR and CDR to work on NIL is, in retrospect, a bad idea.
[23:24:14] <macaw> ^ Very much agreed. A destructive SORT without an N- leading is misleading for a newcomer.

[23:26:14] <masinter> Having NIL transparent and false are very handy
[23:26:40] <masinter> JavaScript took it further
[23:27:01] <masinter> I forget what python did
[23:27:56] <kagevf> I think "gentle intro" is a better one for starting with CL, especially if you have no prior experience using any lisp http://cs.cmu.edu/~dst/lispbook/book.pdf (PDF)
[23:28:33] <kagevf> there's a lot in the beginning you can fly through until you get to the chapters that actually start using some code, though
[23:29:02] <masinter> https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues/609
[23:30:25] <pdietz> I used Interlisp many years ago, at Schlumberger.   Fun times.  The Dorado was nice in cold winters.
[23:31:41] <masinter> i think we can run it on a pi zero 2 w

[23:59:38] <pjb> Indeed, instead of NIL  we could even have BOTTOM, and any function that gets BOTTOM as an argument would automatically return BOTTOM as result.
