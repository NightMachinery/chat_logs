[00:51:15] <Khepra> dob1: the systemd.unit(5) explains the difference. With Wants,   if your.service Wants=postgresql.service, and postgres fails tostart, your.service will STILL start.   Wiht Requires=   it will fail to start
[00:52:02] *** Joins: tejr (~tejr@user/tejr)
[00:52:03] <Khepra> however, neither will block boot per se. Boot is blocked when a critical requirement is not met. Eg, a filesystem mount cannot be fulfilled. Service failing in general doesn't unless systemd cannot determine a service has failed, and waits with a start job for the configured timeout
[00:52:04] <dob1> Khepra, I can test them, no problem but my "fear" is that I fail to boot
[00:52:37] <dob1> Khepra, ah ok
[00:53:24] <Khepra> ideally, all services would be Type=simple or Type=notify so systemd has full control. Alas, the reality is far from ideal, especially in Debian that wants to sit on both chairs, so you have fu^W Forking services in which case systemd is clueless what's going on
[00:54:24] *** Joins: OzFalcon (~OzFalcon@203-59-214-100.dyn.iinet.net.au)
[00:54:41] <Khepra> dob1: a critical chain is for example this. you have a multi-user.target as boot requirement (boot targed). multi-user.target "Requires" service A. if A fails, the target fails. if A requires B, and B fails, the target fails, because A failed by proxy. hence Wants, which is a bit looser requirement.

[00:56:15] <dob1> Khepra, and if I disable postgres service?
[00:56:35] <dob1> it is smart to understand to not wait for it for the requires ?
[00:56:36] <OzFalcon> Simple question I seem unable to work out. I have a local package.deb and I want to list it's dependencies. gdebi says all dependencies satisfied - But how do I list deps for a local deb package?
[00:56:39] <Khepra> dob1: it _will_ get started with Requres I think, but not with Wants. "Disabled" doesn't guarantee a service won't run, only "Masked" state does

[00:57:40] <Khepra> dob1: well, I'm not 100% sure that Wants= will NOT start a "disabled" service. the Wants= vs Requires= is more about the unit requiring, and wheter it enters a failed state if a dependency fails
[00:58:47] <Khepra> dob1: yeah looking at the manpage, it's not explicitely stated, but methinks Wants=  _will_ start a disabled service.   after all, try and see. bottom line, Requires= vs Wants= is about the requiring service and its state
[00:58:53] <somiaj> grolongo: I would finish the install and get a working base system, from there you'll have all the base tools
[01:00:04] <grolongo> alright, thanks
[01:00:36] <dob1> Khepra, to be honest After on man is not precise too, because I have doubts on After too,  you are telling to start this unit after another.  but if the other one doesn't start??

[01:04:51] <Khepra> dob1: After is just ordering in time. No dependency like Requires or Wants
[01:05:41] <Khepra> in fact, with After= alone you might have issues if the first service hasn't started properly or fully. That's why services need Type=notify so they can signal readiness. Without it, it's easy to end up in a broken state
[01:05:41] *** Quits: noord (~noord@user/noord) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[01:06:03] <dob1> Khepra, I don't understand this thing, you are creating a dependency if you state that the service has to start after another
[01:06:29] <Khepra> For example, I have units that Require postgres. But, our databases are huge and they take minutes to load up fully. So depending services will have to wait or be signalled otherwise when postgres is _truly_ ready to start taking queries.
[01:07:06] <Khepra> dob1: no, just ordering in time
[01:07:45] <Khepra> with Wants and Requres, starting a service will also cascade to Wanted or Required. Not so with After
[01:09:11] <dob1> I tested that either Wants and Requires will start a disabled service
[01:10:28] <Khepra> dob1: let's say   your.service is After=postgresql.service.     on boot, postgres is started first, then, say, a milisecond later, your.service is started. that's _all_ . it has zero effect on manually started your.service.   with Wants and Requires, Postgres can be not slated to start on boot at all, and on its own, it won't be. but your.service will force a "start" for Wanted and Required.
[01:10:40] <Khepra> also if you manually start your.service, it'll cascade to Wanted and Required
[01:11:10] <Khepra> dob1: right, so the difference is only whether your.service will fail. Won't if Wanted doesn't start, will if Required doesn't start.
[01:11:47] *** Quits: siloammop (~user@191.32.141.65) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[01:13:15] <Khepra> and again, the real problem is with Type of the dependency. With Type=notify or simple, systemd is aware of starting states and can react properly. Forking, however, exit with or without having forked, and doesn't signal systemd. that's the worst kind.
[01:13:35] <dob1> forking you don't know when it's started for sure
[01:13:50] <dob1> because it exit after the fork, right?
[01:14:28] <Khepra> Type=notify is the best as your service can take time and when it's truly ready, it "notifies" systemd which then in turn starts those that depend on it.   with type=simple, it only has to start and not exit while dependants are starting.   with type=forking, all bets are off, hilarity often ensues, haters hate.
[01:14:33] <Khepra> dob1: right.

[01:15:36] <Khepra> note that some services in Debian are Type=forking even though they're capable of being managed as Type=simple and even if they're capable of being sd-notify services.
[01:15:56] <somiaj> maybe look at the mount units created by systemd, those will have the boot fail if they fail
[01:16:01] <Khepra> That's because the ecosystem around the service config is catering to both systemd and "other inits". worst possible decision the Debianites have made in over 20 years.

[01:17:06] <Khepra> dob1: no. oneshot is _permitted_ to exit. RemainAfterExit is merely telling systemd to track the service as "still running" even if it exits
[01:17:19] <dob1> it results active
[01:17:28] *** Quits: CEP (~CEP@user/cep) (Quit: me juí)
[01:17:38] <Khepra> correct. even though the process itself is not running, the service is considered "active" and running
[01:18:04] <dob1> it is used to make it execute the Exec on stop action?
[01:18:21] <dob1> when you invoke stop I mean
[01:18:38] <Khepra> I have that on a service I wrote that checks _true_ network-online state by pinging some external (Beyond LAN-WAN gate) server. The service wait until pings start coming back and then exits. this signals readiness with RemainAfterExit
[01:18:41] <dob1> I was thinking the meaning of this configuration

[01:20:06] *** Joins: jkc (~jkc@almalinux/security/jkc)

[01:26:23] <Khepra> pidfiles are abomination. the relics of a bygone era. and sources of so much grief and also hilarity. services failing right after havign written out the pidfile, and there's no process manager to tell if the process is running or isn't, so you have to haxxor a `ps` grep to find out.... terrible, just, terrible.

[05:40:37] <iShareFreedom> less time
[05:40:59] <awal1> iShareFreedom, the best clean thing you can do is doing a minimal install then install only the pkgs you really want if you know what you do
[05:41:08] <n4dir> debian live xfce4 probably has the task xfce installed.
[05:41:16] <iShareFreedom> how i can do a minimal install, a net isntall you say?
[05:41:35] <n4dir> iShareFreedom: you deselect desktop-environment during installation process
[05:41:42] <xx> iShareFreedom: netinstall, and unselect all the options where it asks what to install (I don't recommend this, at least the standard tools should be picked)
[05:41:59] <awal1> any official image live or not live and when in tasksel step just choose "standard debian packages"
[05:42:07] <awal1> i think it is reffered like that
[05:42:18] <xx> sounds about right
[05:42:40] <malloy> hello, pulseaudio usually cann't recognize headphone output but it recognizes the headphone input, restarting pulseaudio service and reboot don't fix it.

[05:44:45] <awal1> iShareFreedom, seriously, if you are new in debian, i suggest you: keep gnome and install a virtualization pkg then create vm's and try stuff there. when you are ready, do your stuff in real hardware

[06:02:51] <themill> if it's certbot, that's in /etc/logrotate.d/certbot

[06:04:32] <themill> the certbot package ships that file

However, when I mount the device, I am only able to see /mnt/public when using usb mass storage. Is there a way to view the other folders on the device running Debian? Thank you.
[06:25:05] <roosterphant> i switched from fedora a year ago and was wondering if debian is stable enough to do that sort of stuff
[06:25:30] <BalooRJ> I'd rather see if I can access all of the files of the device through USB Mass storage than through telnet

[14:35:02] <Khepra> anyone using sway here? I have certain issues. Firefox doesn't render context menus, I have to repeatedly click to get them out: right click context menu (eg. spellchecker options in input forms), or clicking the + icon for container tab selection popup. Also xwayland issues. I have keepassxc (qt thingy) that after a while of sitting in the tray, does not respond to clicking to open it. Repeated clicking
[14:35:08] <Khepra> spins up the CPU to max for a minute or so until it "releases" itself and starts responding;  or it loses visual elements once you open it, doesn't respond to any clicks....
[14:36:21] <Khepra> oh also.... foot terminal.... SOMEHOW that's completely and utterly beyond me, pipe is broken. `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 32 ; echo`  =>  tr: write error: broken pipeC;, cat: write error: broken pipe
[14:36:57] <Haohmaru> Khepra what was the "sway" thing?

[14:43:13] <Haohmaru> are you running low on RAM or have hit the swap?

[14:43:46] <Haohmaru> or harddisk issues.. those could explain certain slow-downs
[14:44:04] <Khepra> I don't have slowdowns. I have UI rendering issues
[14:44:14] <Haohmaru> same sh*t ;P~
[14:44:47] <Haohmaru> dying gpu?
[14:44:59] <Khepra> not at all. the elements ARE there, just not rendered. how do I know? If I imagine the context menu after clicking + in Firefox, and move the mouse a bit lower and click? It friggin opens the tab in the container that'd be in that's in the list where the mouse was
[14:45:15] <Haohmaru> ah, nice
[14:45:28] <Haohmaru> could it be z-buffer glitches?
[14:45:54] <Khepra> the gpu is not dying.... look... all this shit doesn't happen under xorg. A/B tests, I did. xorg has _other_ issues, amdgpu kernel module throws an error and then everything freezes BUT I can ctrl-alt my way into anothjer TTY and nuke the fugger (xserver)
[14:46:13] <Khepra> and that happens maybe once or twice a week (my workstation is 24/7 on)
[14:46:16] <Haohmaru> the wayland thing was about being able to use the GPU to deal with the UI drawing, right?
[14:46:31] <Haohmaru> (among other things)
[14:46:53] <Khepra> the problem with FF I think is in FF itself. The problem with keepassxc is methinks int he way qt wants something out of xwayland
[14:47:11] *** Quits: Hiccup (cHoy@user/hiccup) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:47:29] <Haohmaru> can you make a screenshot of something that looks wrong? just curious
[14:47:32] <Khepra> because other xwayland things (libre office for example) don't have such issues. hell, I even play games on this thing through xwayland with no observable FPS loss compared to a xorg steam session
[14:47:41] <Haohmaru> or is it not easily visible on a static screenshot
[14:47:53] <Khepra> Haohmaru: the context menu does not render, so I can't screenshot what isn't there :)
[14:48:15] <Khepra> keepassxc thingy? well, I could, I just have to leave it open sitting in the tray for a while.
[14:48:16] <Haohmaru> right, i mean if there are corrupted-like chunks of UI or something
[14:49:11] <Haohmaru> for the invisible menu, i'd try to see if maybe the menu is there but "behind" other things (wrong z-order)
[14:49:21] <Khepra> this can really be solved by someone else using sway + FF confirming or debunking the allegations against FF :)
[14:49:51] <Khepra> Haohmaru: I don't know if z-order is the issue, but it definitely DOES react to clicks if I imagine the menu is there and try to click it
[14:49:53] <Haohmaru> i only use LXDE plus bits from xfce, which aren't wayland, and no idea what the sway is
[14:50:08] <Khepra> (I'd assume if it were z-order issue then the elements wouldn't be clickable, with something else being in Z front them)
[14:50:26] <Haohmaru> Khepra there's drawing z-order, and z-order for mouse clicks, which may or may not be equal
[14:50:31] <Khepra> Haohmaru: sway is i3-wm fork for wayland. at least I think it's a fork and not full rewrite
[14:50:33] <Haohmaru> depends on how they've done it
[14:50:52] <Haohmaru> yeah i3-wm was that window manager for h4x0rz, i cannot use that thing
[14:51:04] <Khepra> I'm guessing the issue here with FF is sway, because if it were FF itself under wayland, I'd be hearing about this a lot from 'buntu users
[14:51:46] <Haohmaru> is the desktop/UI drawn using the GPU?
[14:52:15] <Khepra> most likely, wayland compositors are GPU oriented
[14:52:15] <Haohmaru> drawn and/or "put together" by the GPU

[14:52:20] <Haohmaru> right
[14:52:52] <Haohmaru> Khepra i've had z-buffer related issues in certain programs, both on linux and windows, due to silly videocard
[14:52:54] <Khepra> Haohmaru: which would maybe explain why I don't have those amdgpu kernel module crashes under sway, that I do under xorg/i3-wm
[14:53:29] <Khepra> Haohmaru: I suppose that's a possibility, but my primary task here is to find out WHAT is at fault. Firefox? or sway.
[14:53:45] <Haohmaru> how about you try another window manager?

[16:27:59] <Khepra> areyouloco: your first problem is that Failed to unload module 'nvidia' thingy reported by bumblebeed.service. Look into dmesg or `journalctl -kg nvidia` (if that's bullseye, otherwise you don't have -g and must `| grep nvidia` instead). with journal, or dmesg -T, you can correlate timestamps and confirm the two log entries are related
[16:29:12] <Khepra> the other problem, opening/locating /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.d . If that directory exists, check that the daemon has permissions to access it. Even if it runs as root, the .service unit might contain namespacing or path restrictions.

[16:45:52] <dpkg> From Debian 9 "Stretch" onwards (xorg-server 1.17.3-1), the Xorg server is no longer setuid root, reducing the risk of privilege escalation security problems. This relies on logind and libpam-systemd and moves the logs to ~/.local/share/xorg; use the xserver-xorg-legacy package and see Xwrapper.config(5) if you'd rather a setuid root X.

[16:48:11] <Khepra> randall: that factoid is mildly misleading. while technically correct, the proper context is how xorg-server is launched. GDM runs it rootless. lightdm, for example does not. startx/xinit is of course rootless unless you for some reason login as root first.
[16:48:36] <Khepra> (kdm/sddm I _think_, not sure, also doesn't run it rootless)

[17:53:26] <Khepra> that file, /debain/bumblebee.conf    is missing in the bullseye and sid versions  (3.2.1-27). if you have it, could it be there from upgrade from buster? maybe there's a reason the file is removed, even though it's referenced int he postinst scripts and install file list

[17:55:00] <areyouloco> If I reboot my laptop doesnt go to X anymore

[17:55:19] <areyouloco> nope
[17:55:23] <Khepra> the blacklist file is definitely missing from 3.2.1-26-bpo and 3.2.1-27, but it's still referenced as if it should exist
[17:55:28] <areyouloco> I guess I should
[17:55:41] <unborn> areyouloco: you should..

[18:11:55] <unborn> @  grobi no.. it would not make any sense ... its non free
[18:12:01] <grobi> or has iwlwifi to be updatet?
[18:12:19] <Khepra> grobi: no. just... don't install more nonfree apps. if you have packages from nonfree you need nonfree to get nonfree updates for the nonfree packages. unless you don't want updates, but that might easily break your system with not direclty obvious reason

[18:14:45] <Khepra> it's very unlikely that existing packages will get an update that all of a sudden pull in something new from non-free. not technically impossible, esp. during point release bumps, but it's just unlikely. so, just be careful what you install and where it comes from, if you want to avoid nonfree

[18:15:40] <Khepra> apt upgrade -s -V | grep non-free     will list those, you could run this before each upgrade if that really mattered so much
[18:15:47] <Khepra> apt-get I mean
[18:16:51] <Khepra> grobi: yes yes. removing the non-free component would have that same effect, no more updates (or new installations) from non-free. it's possible nothing bad would happen, but it's possible an update would block because it can't resolve a dependency. this is likely to happen, if at all it does, during point releases

[20:12:47] <rawtaz> my main gripe with rust is that (afaik, perhaps im wrong?) you cannot cross-compile to a single binary with just rust installed. e.g. with Go i can sit on my mac and write software that i then just build out of the Go box for windows, linux, etc, they dont need any installation and it's just runnable right away, and i dont need to install anything but Go to do this. that's *awesome* IMO.

[21:14:26] *** Quits: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:15:47] <Khepra> PerfDave: the way I love to nitpick this is that "chroot containers" are also containers. "contaieners" is a vague term in linux, doesn't exist in a tangible way. it's all namespaces taht are misnamed as containers.
[21:15:58] <Daisenryaku> may naive guess is that it would be in /var/cache somewhere
[21:16:06] <kveroneau> CCFL_Man, if you need more hardware-like access such as sound, might be better to go with a full VM, most CPUs these days have the virtualization extensions so VMs feel almost native in speed in most situations.
[21:16:36] <Khepra> why the overhead of VMs? if the reason here, and it is, is just to isolate library dependencies, a full VM would be overkill
[21:16:49] *** Quits: lukaso666 (~IRC@109.95.146.121) (Quit: все, пока!)
[21:18:46] <kveroneau> Khepra, that's fair.  Although direct hardware access is a bit tricky to get working inside a container, there is much less fuss to test out libraries and programs which access hardware in a VM.
[21:18:59] <Khepra> kveroneau: not at all, you jsut bind-mount /dev
[21:19:45] <Khepra> granted, _certain_ specific "containerization" crapware like docker might make a whole drama and two epic novels about it, but that's docker crapware.
[21:20:07] <kveroneau> There are also capabilities to keep in mind as well.  While the container may have access to the device in /dev, a Kernel capability might still further restrict access.
[21:20:10] <Khepra> systemd-nspawn is just a --bind switch away. or chroots.   unshare -m ; mount -R /dev ... ; done
[21:20:51] <Khepra> kveroneau: which again is specific to "containerization" tools used
[21:20:54] <kveroneau> I actually did some personal research on how each container technology uses kernel capabilities to restrict stuff.
[21:21:56] <Khepra> but that isnt' the goal here, the whole purpose is to isolate library dependencies. security isn't an issue and thus caps needn't be in the equation at all.
[21:22:52] <Khepra> and speaking of, it's actually _worse_ for VMs to deal with hardware because it's virtualized. so either you deal with buggy virtualization layers, or you pci passthrough it
[21:24:11] <Khepra> I suppose that depends on the application, latencies required etc..., but my experience is creating and runing high perf gaming VMs. default virtualized audio of qemu-kvm is garbage for a gaming VM (eg. DirectSound low latency)
[21:25:11] <Khepra> things got a bit better with latest qemu (5.2 and newer), but it's still too bad, compared to just buying a cheap pci audio thingy and passing it through.
[21:25:27] <kveroneau> If all they need is to isolate library deps, then a container should match their requirements.  VMs are actually much better than you might come to realize, depending on what you are trying to do with it.  For my use-cases, I don't play any Direct3D games, and a Windows XP VM to in KVM to play classic Diablo 2 actually works really well.

[21:28:38] <kveroneau> Oddly it works really well over the SPICE protocol virt-manager uses on the local system.  I used to play Direct2D games in VirtualBox, as I thought SPICE or VNCs method libvirt uses would hinter performance, I was actually very impressed to find out how well it worked, and then I dumped VirtualBox for my new best friend, libvirt. :)

[21:29:17] <XileX> My main VM use is for zoom
[21:29:59] <Khepra> I suppose it's not bad where performance demands are low and hardware is capable. But I'm talking about VMs capable of runnign things like Doom (2016 and 2019) where direct hardware access (which is the topic here) is paramount. if a program can do just fine with virtualized and emulated layers, that's okay too.
[21:30:29] <Khepra> and since we don't know the needs here (other than isolating library dependencies), this is all academic.
