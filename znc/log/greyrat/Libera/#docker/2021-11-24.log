[00:39:48] <devslash> I set up roundcube
[00:39:58] <queue-> nice
[00:40:00] <queue-> roundcube works too
[00:40:06] <devslash> I have to figure out why in the Fck its not working over https though
[00:40:17] <queue-> just reverse proxy with nginx
[00:40:27] *** Joins: bouncy (~ben@user/benoit)
[00:40:27] <devslash> I already use Traefik
[00:40:35] <devslash> which is a reverse proxy 
[00:40:44] <queue-> doesnt sound like a good one if https isnt working
[00:40:46] <queue-> like i said i just use nginx
[00:40:53] <devslash> no thats not the solution
[00:40:54] <queue-> then sudo certbot --nginx certonly -d example.com
[00:40:56] <LordKalma> I use apache :p 
[00:41:03] <LordKalma> devslash, it totally is
[00:41:11] <devslash> ok if you say so..
[00:41:14] <queue-> nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
[00:41:15] <LordKalma> honestly, myself for example, use http on everything I do 
[00:41:24] <queue-> dude how do u not know reverse proxies outside of traefik
[00:41:25] <LordKalma> and just shove apache in front of everything
[00:41:26] <queue-> lol
[00:41:31] <queue-> apache is nasty
[00:41:33] <queue-> use nginx
[00:41:50] <queue-> apache is specific use case and its minimalistic
[00:41:57] <LordKalma> Apache comes bundled with Virtualmin and I don't care :p 
[00:42:02] <LordKalma> it has been more than enough
[00:42:03] <queue-> oh lol
[00:42:10] <queue-> yea but virtualmin looks like bloat to me
[00:42:11] <LordKalma> but yeah, I'll using nginx for a project in the near future
[00:42:19] <devslash> with traefik you add a few labels to your docker container and you're good to go..
[00:42:32] <queue-> yea i like to do things the old fashion way
[00:42:32] <LordKalma> queue-, not when you're just a hobbyist that prefers that someone that knows their stuff to config stuff for you
[00:42:34] <devslash> I obviously made some kind of mistake here wityh my config...
[00:42:42] <rawtaz> i dont see why one would use nginx for reverse proxy if one already has traefik set up :D
[00:42:50] <devslash> you wouldnt
[00:42:56] <devslash> that wouldnt make any sense at all
[00:42:58] <queue-> cause i know nginx so well :P
[00:43:04] <queue-> i use it for more than just reverse proxy
[00:43:12] <queue-> middleware auth etc
[00:43:20] <queue-> i just know how to set it up in seconds w/ nginx outside of the container
[00:43:22] <LordKalma> that's kinda my "problem" with apache. I have a simple use case and I know the syntax
[00:43:28] <devslash> I use Nginx as a web server but let Traefik handle all of the reverse proxy stuff
[00:43:31] <queue-> thats always been my setup, :shrug:
[00:43:45] <devslash> plus Traefik auto renews your LE certs for you.
[00:43:55] <queue-> well that is kinda nice but i have a bash script for that
[00:43:57] <queue-> :D
[00:44:05] <LordKalma> Virtualmin handles that for me too :p
[00:44:08] *** Joins: lehinsun (~ttytwiste@188.113.176.117)
[00:44:14] <queue-> most UI's will handle that for ya
[00:44:17] <LordKalma> With DNS-level methods
[00:44:21] <LordKalma> so I can have the wilcard certificate
[00:44:40] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:44:47] <queue-> i guess i need to setup traefik once and for all
[00:44:59] <queue-> i kinda do want to monitor my website logs
[00:45:05] <LordKalma> but yeah, anyway, point was that, yeah, I think it's pretty much "normal" to have containers bound to localhost and shove a reverse proxy in front of them
[00:45:09] <rawtaz> queue-: thats a nice skille to have, knowing nginx config so well :)
[00:45:13] <LordKalma> with HTTPS and all that good stuff
[00:46:34] <queue-> is that i mostly just want to setup traefik for monitoring
[00:46:50] <devslash> with roundcube, do I need to bind to 443 or 80 ?
[00:46:51] <queue-> i have nothing monitoring my website at the moment, id have to dig through raw logs
[00:47:15] <queue-> u always want 443 as much as possible, tls all the things
[00:47:33] <queue-> you should be redirecting http -> https
[00:47:49] <LordKalma> ^that
[00:48:02] <devslash> my Reverse proxy handles forwarding all http traffic to https automatically
[00:48:07] <queue-> so even if someone http://blahblah they get redirected to https
[00:48:11] <queue-> cool
[00:48:16] <LordKalma> my apache config is basically http://* -> https://*
[00:48:18] <queue-> so roundcube is gonna bind to 80
[00:48:20] <queue-> not 443
[00:48:27] <queue-> u can really put 80 to whatever u want
[00:48:40] <LordKalma> roundcube's container is probably expecting you to bind 80
[00:48:50] <queue-> u can alter that 
[00:49:03] <queue-> but yea initially its all bound to port 80
[00:49:15] <queue-> most things are p difficult to change ports unless you build from source/dockerfile
[00:49:19] <LordKalma> I could, but then again, I don't enable https on my containers
[00:49:28] <devslash> I bashed into the container and did netstat -ltup and it shows that inside the docker container its listening on port 80
[00:49:29] <LordKalma> only on the reverse proxy
[00:49:40] <LordKalma> because I have better things to do than configuring LE 500 times
[00:49:46] <queue-> ya cause by default thats what roundcube sets to
[00:49:55] <queue-> but i have so many services i dont bind anything to just '80'
[00:49:55] <rawtaz> note that a mail service needs certificate handling outside of the reverse proxy, for the SMTP and IMAP
[00:49:58] <queue-> unless its my true landing page
[00:50:33] <LordKalma>  queue- I usually do localhost:8xxx:80 on every container
[00:50:38] <LordKalma> for the port setup
[00:50:41] <devslash> so I can access the RC login using the internal IP
[00:50:51] *** Quits: Enitin (~Enitin@82.102.22.84) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[00:50:53] <LordKalma> and then bind 8xxx to whatever reverse proxy settings
[00:50:53] <devslash> In Traefik you add a line like this to bind to a port
[00:50:59] <queue-> same but i map the port to he same area
[00:51:04] <queue-> so its 8xxx:8xxx for me
[00:51:06] <devslash>   - "traefik.http.services.webmail.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
[00:51:37] <queue-> i generally try not to criss-cross due to how many services im running
[00:51:39] <queue-> gets confusing :D
[00:52:05] <LordKalma> I have a txt file with the bindings
[00:52:12] <LordKalma> also, since I'm the weak UI guy I do have portainer
[00:52:19] <LordKalma> I don't do administration with it, I do prefer the CLI
[00:52:25] <LordKalma> but it's nice to look at status and configs
[00:53:05] <queue-> i map it all in my brain :D
[00:53:25] <queue-> i really should draw out diagrams, id be much more organized
[00:53:27] <devslash> LordKalma, I dunno if youd be interested but I wrote a python script that you use in the command line to manage your containers. It works if you have 1 directory with all of your compose files in it. thats the only requirement
[00:53:51] <queue-> cant portainer do that
[00:54:01] <queue-> i know portainer is bloat and not needed but
[00:54:05] <queue-> isnt that the same thing
[00:54:38] <queue-> i have portainer running, i honestly dont even know why
[00:54:40] <queue-> i dont need it
[00:54:47] <LordKalma> devslash, I have like 3 containers
[00:54:48] <LordKalma> but thanks
[00:54:56] <devslash> well my script lets you create, delete or delete and recreate containers from the command line and runs all of the docker commands for you
[00:55:07] <queue-> ah yea
[00:55:13] <queue-> docker-compose down ; docker image prune -a ; docker-compose up -d
[00:55:15] <queue-> ez
[00:55:17] <queue-> lol
[00:55:25] <LordKalma> I only became more into docker because of this django+node+postgres project I'm writing
[00:55:35] <queue-> ezi just setup python flask
[00:55:41] <queue-> i didnt go w/ django cause its templating system is too strict
[00:55:46] <queue-> i like to color outside of the lines
[00:55:47] <queue-> :D
[00:56:20] <queue-> postgres was a good choice, i went with mariadb which cluster wise and migration isnt the bestl ook
[00:56:23] <LordKalma> django is the backend machine for me :p 
[00:56:33] <LordKalma> with the rest framework
[00:57:23] <LordKalma> I'm just a hobbyist, I don't even know SQL
[00:57:33] <LordKalma> so django's ORM is really great for me
[00:57:40] <queue-> not for me
[00:57:46] <queue-> ive setup everything you're talking about
[00:57:51] <LordKalma> and with django's rest framework you can power an amazing API with little code
[00:57:52] <queue-> i migrated from platform to platform, i started in php

[02:10:14] <queue-> but yea if you're doing yahoo/gmail i think it only allows one smtp/imap from what im reading, you'll have to do more digging
[02:10:34] <rawtaz> devslash: no, you can use whichever smtp server you want, as long as it lets you sent mail (which most do as long as you authenticate with them) and of course you also need to configure your domain such that it allows that smtp server to sent mail for your domain (assuming you use SPF or similar)
[02:10:54] <rawtaz> you can for example use mailgun which is free or paid depending on your needs
[02:10:56] <devslash> but then i dont get how you configure multiple servers with env vars

[03:05:58] <rawtaz> its not like its THAT hard to do it. in particular nowadays when there's packages that has it all configured for you
[03:06:27] <rawtaz> devslash: exactly. using reproducible containers or similar, and backing up your data properly, youre good to go

[03:07:16] <rawtaz> please be more specific about what youre thinking about
[03:07:19] <devslash> I have a home account and when I did set up an email server, my emails were getting blocked by Yahoo as spam
[03:07:22] <rawtaz> if you mean the ports, they are not blocked
[03:07:31] <rawtaz> yeah. it has to do with what net you are on etc
[03:07:38] <devslash> no thats not what I meant
[03:07:52] <rawtaz> ideally it shoud be a static IP (as in, not in a netlist that they think is dynamic) and stuch

[03:07:56] *** Joins: denningsrogue (~denningsr@98.97.131.238)
[03:08:18] <devslash> I found that Yahoo uses SpamAssassin service to block ranges of IP addresses and if your home address is in that range then it will be treated like spam
[03:08:43] <Flash> email servers have gotten much more sophisticated about relaying e-mail. It's not feasible for any random user to set up a home e-mail server these days.
[03:09:01] <Flash> I mean, you CAN do it, but the rest of the internet will quarantine you
[03:09:02] <rawtaz> devslash: yes, naturally
[03:09:30] <devslash> Flash, thats only true if you try to set up a mail server behind a residential IP
[03:09:32] <rawtaz> Flash: if you run it in a proper place with a proper IP and dont mess it up entirely, it should be fine i think
[03:10:02] <rawtaz> obviously noone in their sane mind would set up a mail server on some consumer internet connection, thats just asking for trouble (if you can even get outgoing smtp to work lol)
[03:10:18] <Flash> I've done lots of battle with my ISP (hosting my domain) over blocked e-mail. It's way more than just "an OK IP address"
[03:10:33] <rawtaz> what were your problems?
[03:10:57] <rawtaz> ok let me put it this way; i havent done *anything* special at all with my location or its ip address. and i havent had issues.
[03:11:36] <Flash> I get e-mail from a service I subscribe to ... sometimes. There was something about the relay service (mailing list) they were using that wasn't set up just perfectly, and my ISP refused to receive the e-mail
[03:12:00] <devslash> sounds like an issue with your ISP
[03:12:09] <Flash> all the acronyms have fallen out of my head, but there is a DNS record that specifies which IP/hosts can send e-mail
[03:12:12] <devslash> why did they say that they were blocking it 
[03:12:51] <rawtaz> you mean SPF i take it
[03:12:56] *** Quits: jarthur (~jarthur@205.220.129.19) (Quit: jarthur)
[03:13:05] <Flash> yeah, I was just finding the traffic on that topic
[03:13:07] <rawtaz> but that has nothing to do with the receiving of mail, which your ISP shouldnt have anything to do with anyway
[03:14:40] <Flash> "host lookup did not complete" was the error my side gave. It is based on the pseudo-username the mail relay used to send the mail
[03:15:12] <devslash> so wouldnt that indicate a problem with the mail server sending it
[03:15:24] <rawtaz> hm im not entirely following. what part gave that message?
[03:15:51] <devslash> it sounds like you were talking about incoming mail
[03:15:57] <devslash> not outgoing
[03:15:58] <Flash> basically, the FROM address must be acknowledged by the sender as a valid user AND the hostname must be in the SPF record
[03:16:09] <Flash> correct. 
[03:16:28] <Flash> it sounded like you had an issue with Yahoo rejecting your e-mail (incoming)
[03:16:37] <devslash> if anything, you would have issues sending mail not receiving it if you self host a mail server
[03:16:39] <Flash> if I misinterpreted, I will slink away

[04:33:36] <rawtaz> queue-: not sure what you're even trying to say there. yes, but pfsense is a clusterfuck. i migrated from it to opnsense after having used pfsense for many many years. wireguard is as fast regardless where you run it, so not sure what you meant by that. vlans, uh yes what about those.
[04:33:45] <rawtaz> opnsense is actually more user friendly than pfsense, lots.
[04:34:27] <rawtaz> and if you know what pfsense did with the wireguard spectacle, youll know theres no point in running that shit. i even know people who worked af pfsense who jumped ship and wouldnt look back a second, for good reasons.

[04:38:51] <rawtaz> i was hesitant for several years, sticked with the original so to speak, but when i got that fricken bug with the current pfsense i have left i tried opnsense and oh man should i have switched sooner.
[04:38:56] <rawtaz> bleh.
[04:39:30] <rawtaz> besides that i also tried microtik but i hate their gui (too messy) and i also use some OpenWRT based ones which i dont fancy either (im lazy, for a router i do want a gui)
[04:39:54] <queue-> ya i want a gui honestly, but i split my networks with dummy interfaces
[04:39:56] <rawtaz> IMO opnsense is pretty much the only reasonably user friendly router for general needs out there

[06:08:38] <rawtaz> use the one by t<-something> on github
[06:08:45] <rawtaz> (and on docker hub)
[06:09:25] <rawtaz> and when you do, the only "permission" you need to give it using the env vars in your docker compose is the CONTAINERS one - nothing more as far as i have been able to see

[06:19:55] <queue-> multi hops are nice if you're trying to be dodgy
[06:20:42] <queue-> ah i see rawtaz: https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy
[06:21:01] <queue-> this is specifically towards docker ok nvm
[06:21:03] <queue-> lol
[06:21:35] <queue-> Giving access to your Docker socket could mean giving root access to your host, or even to your whole swarm, but some services require hooking into that socket to react to events, etc. Using this proxy lets you block anything you consider those services should not do.
[06:21:37] <queue-> no thanks
[06:22:02] <queue-> rootless docker ftw (all the way across the board)
[06:23:02] <devslash> rawtaz, ok so I followed a tutorial to create a socket-proxy container
[06:23:28] <queue-> what are you tryin to do tho devslash
[06:23:44] <devslash> I rebooted and did a docker command like docker logs Traefik and I get an error that the docker daemon isnt running
[06:24:00] <queue-> because its not on the right port
[06:24:05] <queue-> looking for 5000 or w/e probably
[06:24:06] <devslash> what isnt
[06:24:18] <queue-> thats my guess idk a lot about why you're doing this
[06:24:19] <devslash> traefik ?
[06:24:29] <queue-> no, the fact that docker daemon isnt running
[06:24:36] <queue-> if you're trying this docker-socket-proxy
[06:24:53] <queue-> whats the ultimate reason you are implementing this?
[06:24:54] <devslash> right because its trying to mount to /var/run/sock which isnt there
[06:25:10] <devslash> since I am using the proxy method
[06:25:18] <devslash> I can manually start docker
[06:25:31] <devslash> by running systemctl start docker and then everything works fine
[06:25:52] <queue-> well like color me stupid but i dont see anything but security issues w/ this
[06:25:56] <queue-> so im wondering why is all
[06:26:10] <queue-> there may be a better solution than what you're doing
[06:26:26] <devslash> because a container that gets hacked can lead to your whole system getting hacked if you bind to the sock file
[06:26:36] <queue-> thats if you arent setting PUID and PGID
[06:26:38] <queue-> to 1000
[06:26:43] <queue-> and chown abc:abc * -R
[06:26:53] <queue-> and also properly utilizing .dockerignore
[06:27:09] <queue-> there are lot of things we can do here to avoid trying to run this proxy making u think that it will help in security
[06:27:26] <queue-> this is saying we need to docker root, you dont want that anyway
[06:27:32] <queue-> ps aux |grep docker , is it root?
[06:28:16] <devslash> it looks like it
[06:28:25] <devslash> its returning a bunch of processes
[06:28:36] <queue-> https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/
[06:28:38] <queue-> ignore the proxy
[06:28:44] <queue-> do this and always with environments:
[06:28:51] <queue-> set - PGID: 1000 and PUID: 1000
[06:29:01] <queue-> and in a dockerfile, or command: try to chown if u can
[06:29:39] <queue-> popping shell is easy as hell but if you implement a layer of abstraction to someone who understands containerd just as well as the docker creators do
[06:29:42] <queue-> you're askin for it
[06:29:43] *** Joins: gopar (~gopar@c-73-189-166-199.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[06:30:15] <queue-> you need to do the bare minimum and set those vars like im talking about
[06:30:21] <queue-> in everything you do with docker
[06:32:11] <queue-> on top of that you should throw the containers in a VM
[06:32:14] <queue-> to lol more @ hackers
[06:32:51] <queue-> escaping one container to realize you need another exploit to break out of another framework, thats a nightmare to anyone
[06:33:37] <devslash> no offense but I dont agree with your solution...
[06:33:45] <queue-> ok
[06:33:50] <devslash> I found a solution thats much easier to deal with

[06:34:50] <queue-> kinda shitty you have to rig it like that
[06:34:54] <queue-> but all good
[06:35:04] <devslash> ill have to read up on this some more
[06:35:13] <queue-> rc.local is of old age (i still use it cause im of old age as well :D )

[06:35:50] <devslash> what is "old age"
[06:35:50] <queue-> well your temp solution is more like throwing on a black cloak in public thinking you're invisible to everyone else
[06:35:52] <devslash> ?
[06:35:58] <queue-> not many use rc.local anymore
[06:36:15] <queue-> its deprecated as of at least 6 years by now
[06:36:23] <devslash> I am pretty sure that there will be a solution that will let me remove that line from rc.local
[06:36:45] <devslash> this is my temporary fix for now
[06:37:04] <queue-> yea i mean if it makes ya feel good and it teaches you more
[06:37:07] <queue-> go for it
[06:37:14] <queue-> but it literally is like being in public
[06:37:20] <queue-> and throwing a big black blanket of your head to cover up who you are
[06:37:32] <queue-> all someone has to do is gently lift it up with their pinky to spot out the issue
[06:37:44] <devslash> well this is my temporary solution and since that script is not externally exposed,its not like it poses a risk
[06:38:01] <queue-> yea i mean thats true except for ip spoofing
[06:38:03] <queue-> ;)
[06:38:31] <devslash> the only way to access my server remotely is ssh without password auth using private/public keys
[06:38:44] <queue-> ye we all use pki
[06:38:46] <devslash> so I dont know how IP spoofing would make any difference
[06:38:50] <queue-> disable usepam and passwordauthentication etc
[06:38:54] <queue-> in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[06:38:56] <queue-> thats ez
[06:39:02] <devslash> yea I did that
[06:39:13] <queue-> but i go levels nad levels and levels above that
[06:39:53] <queue-> things ive heard people in here say that i generally thought were smarter than me sometimes make me lol in terms of security, they say things arent possible and something else may actually be more secure than the other but its inaccurate cause the stuff they are talking about im actively doing every day

[15:08:33] <mei> well i am bit confused. it seems that are ready images that have that purpose: as example google make few with debian. so it means docker by itself can't just contain and run a binary right? you still need some environment that apparently such images give you

[19:31:09] <zoraj> guys ! Am I doing it the right way ? whenever I change my Java Web Project Code, I have to rebuild the image then re-run the container over and over, I start learning Docker few minutes ago and this is how I do it, I thought docker is for packaging app with all dependencies and not for building it. My Dockerfile is as simple as this https://pastebin.com/ZWDF15Ec
[19:32:14] *** Quits: vidbina (~vid@ppp-171-96-190-130.revip8.asianet.co.th) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:32:32] <tabakhase> zoraj that sounds all as expected
[19:32:57] <selckin> you generally wouldn't do that for development, since obviously super slow, but you can make image ethat way to run in prod
[19:33:08] <programmerq> you can build outside the Dockerfile if you want to, but it's nice having the build as part of a build stage so it's repeatable no matter where you run it.
[19:33:32] <tabakhase> maybe clearify what you mean what "may be wrong"?
[19:34:28] <zoraj> I am wondering if docker user is doing it as I am doing, because as selckin is saying, it kinda slow for developing thing
[19:34:45] <tabakhase> (guess noteworthy mention "use docker as runtime" as in, share code right from your disk with a container without building -- but that only works with languages that do so, so php or whatever, java you "have to build"
[19:35:02] <selckin> zoraj: you wouldn't even use maven to build during development
[19:35:03] <zoraj> rebuilding the image whenever I change codes seems slow to me
[19:35:11] <tabakhase> docker can do "either and both" - what pices of it you may use depends on needs, so thats all goodie
[19:35:36] <zoraj> selckin, I use maven during development oO

[19:39:05] <zoraj> selckin, your last message trigger my curiosity, how do you build your program during development ? without using a build system such as maven ? 
[19:39:47] <selckin> with IDE, you'd do maybe maven build & tests before pushing/commiting changes
[19:41:06] <zoraj> that's it, your IDE is using maven to build your project during development
[19:41:46] <selckin> bit offtopic here, but not really
[19:42:52] <zoraj> I fully agree that it's offtopic, back to docker, is it ok then to recreate the image then run the container whenever I finished changing my code ? 
[19:43:54] <zoraj> I ask this, because during a day I may change codes 50 times a day
[19:44:13] <zoraj> it would be crazy to rebuild my image 50 times a day
[19:44:30] <zoraj> this question seems stupid, as I said I'm starting to learn docker
[19:44:36] <tabakhase> kinda, kinda not
[19:44:50] <tabakhase> it wouldnt be "wrong" for the bvery least - may be noisy tho indeed
[19:46:10] <tabakhase> "technically" there is nothing stopping you from "bindmounitng your disk into it, use "docker exec" to build, and then restart the container (that runs the bin also from the shared bindmount)
[19:47:11] <tabakhase> and that would still be a "totally correct thing todo" in the end, docker has no hard feelings there ;-)
[19:48:26] <tabakhase> mix that both together, and just have ONE container that runs the bin from disk, and then a "docker run .... build-war && docker restart servercontainer" - or anything inbetween
[19:51:04] <tabakhase> basically split what your result shall be, and attack those as there own issues -- instead of "dev this in docker" have it become "build this via docker"+"run this war in docker" and youre half way there
[19:54:07] <zoraj> :) ok thank for enlightening me, I was worried  that I'm doing it the wrong way, I guess my concern does not exist for interpreted language such a php because I could use -v argument to map fiolder between host and container,

[21:03:07] <Atlas667> nyuszika7h Im no expert, but that means they are open. What you are saying with the port mappings is just connecting the ¨outside¨ with the ¨inside¨. But the application might still be configured to run on 80 or 443. So pointing to 6060 but not having the application run on that server will return a timeout. go into your application settings and change the ports to 6060.

[21:11:29] <rawtaz> if your container restarts over and over again it means that the process it runs fails and exits. hence the container restarts
[21:11:35] <rawtaz> check logs to see if you can find anything in there
[21:11:42] <devslash> yea I did
[21:11:48] <devslash> it just says sent sigterm

[21:12:05] <devslash> [s6-finish] sending all processes the TERM signal.
[21:12:05] <devslash> [s6-finish] sending all processes the KILL signal and exiting.
[21:12:20] <rawtaz> what is s6-finish?
[21:12:24] <devslash> no idea
[21:12:41] <devslash> are you familiar with Heimdall
[21:13:21] <devslash> I commented out the command and rebuilt the container then bash'ed into the container and manually ran the command

[21:15:27] <rawtaz> what is the ENTRYPOINT of the image?
[21:16:24] <notevil> nyuszika7h: docker sets up a proxy to handle connecting the host port to the container's port. so you'll see that listening on the ports (via nmap).

[21:20:08] <nyuszika7h> it works fine to access it from the host itself
[21:20:12] <nyuszika7h> but not externally
[21:20:30] <rawtaz> devslash: then simply look in the corresponding Dockerfile
[21:20:51] <devslash> I mean I suppose I could but Iwould have to find it somehow
[21:20:59] <rawtaz> devslash: it matters becayse the ENTRYPOINT is what is the actual process that's started. the CMD is the command to that process
[21:21:05] <devslash> this is not an image that I built myself
[21:21:13] <nyuszika7h> inside the container:
[21:21:15] <nyuszika7h> tcp          LISTEN        0             4096                       0.0.0.0:6060                      0.0.0.0:*            users:(("squid",pid=27,fd=10))         
[21:21:28] <rawtaz> yeah gotta find the code repo for that image. start by looking for it on docker hub, they often link to the source code repo there (but not always)
[21:22:44] <devslash> I found a much easier solution. instead of copying the file I just set up a bind mount
[21:23:03] <rawtaz> ok
[21:23:43] <rawtaz> you do know that the cp command you wrote above only copies files inside the container, not from the outside of it, right? unless of course you would have bind mounted /config/items.php or the path of it into the container of course
[21:23:52] * rawtaz bbiaw
[21:25:32] <Atlas667> nyuszika7h, by acces externally do you mean another network on your computer, or from outside your network?

[21:37:18] <tabakhase> asside from your issue, you do not need to use systemd (or whatever) to start containers... just set a restart-policy ON the container itself :P (and checkout docker-compose to have yaml instead of a 23324character docker-run shellworm :P)
[21:38:11] <tabakhase> for external, note that nmap and such can give foggy results, as this is port-forwarding with iptables happening there (and thats kinda also where to start debugging on then)
[21:38:29] <nyuszika7h> yeah, systemd was just a lazy solution because I haven't bothered learning docker-compose yet
[21:38:39] <nyuszika7h> I think I'm closer to finding something out
[21:38:47] <nyuszika7h> the port becomes filtered when OpenVPN is started inside the container
[21:38:59] <nyuszika7h> the point is to expose an openvpn connection as a squid proxy
[21:39:22] <tabakhase> (compose isnt needed for restart-policy, just to be extra clear there)
[21:40:01] <nyuszika7h> does restart policy automatically start containers on boot too?
[21:40:59] <tabakhase> yep (and for many more reasons one can filter on)

[22:23:38] <physikoi> Say i'm using php*-apache as my base image and using the multistage build technique. I'm struggling to figure out how to best handle administrative tasks like updating npm and composer packages. I know one way is to do as described here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/. However, the example is unclear. For one, it's unclear to me what "build: database_admin/" corresponds to. Halp?

[22:26:26] <physikoi> As for admin tasks, I know I could also do `docker-compose exec <container_name> <command>`. So, maybe that's the best way
