[00:05:47] <antto> this is in synaptic..
[00:06:24] <antto> and after that.. "debconf: falling back to frontend: Dialog"
[00:07:22] <antto> is it trying to tell me that synaptic does have some fancyness but it relies on gnome (which i don't have)?

[00:07:54] <greycat> That is a perl error message.  You're missing a perl module.

[00:08:14] <judd> No packages in bullseye/amd64 were found with that file.
[00:08:58] <greycat> ,file Gtk3.pm --release buster
[00:08:58] <antto> forgot to mention that was on debian10
[00:09:02] <judd> Search for Gtk3.pm in buster/amd64: libgtk3-perl: usr/share/perl5/Gtk3.pm
[00:09:13] <greycat> try installing that one (libgtk3-perl)
[00:09:52] <antto> nah i actually just ran a "final" synaptic reload&upgrade
[00:10:00] *** Joins: BuzzardBuzz (~BuzzardBu@173.213.86.120)
[00:10:08] <antto> and i'll try to upgrade that machine to debian11 now
[00:10:27] <greycat> That may not help for this particular issue, since bullseye doesn't have Gtk3.pm at all.
[00:10:41] <antto> i have almost nothing precious on this debian, so it'll be the first one
[00:11:47] <antto> or is this message from apt itself and doesn't have anything to do with me using synaptic?

[00:16:51] <antto> hm, from last time i upgraded (9->10) i seem to remember that you don't wanna do that while your whole DE is running, even if you have "no programs" open.. like, i think i had to logout and maybe even turn off the login manager and whatnot, and do the upgrade procedure from textmode

[00:17:29] <antto> i quickly searched for "DE" and "desktop" and found nothing similar mentioned here: https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html

[00:19:33] <antto> hm, or was it even like using some advanced commands to launch debian from grub so it doesn't even attempt to load anything other than text mode
[00:20:09] <antto> i think i remember doing something like this, telling systemd to only reach textmode
[00:20:30] <greycat> I recommend dropping to the console for release upgrades.
[00:20:54] <greycat> No need to invoke systemd.  Just log out, and Ctrl-Alt-F2 or whatever.
[00:20:58] <antto> i have LXQT/LXDE with probably lightdm
[00:21:27] <antto> so you say it should be fine if i log out of the DE and switch to textmode, even tho lightdm is still running?
[00:21:36] <greycat> yes
[00:21:40] <antto> kewl
[00:22:23] <somiaj> provided you are upgrading in a shell, if you are logged into your DE or not is not really that relavant (though unsaved documents may cause issues)
[00:22:41] <antto> "in a shell" ?
[00:23:31] <somiaj> should have specified tty, which loads a shell
[00:23:33] <greycat> I wouldn't care to do it with a desktop environment session running.  Who knows what that would break.
[00:23:34] <somiaj> so tty shell
[00:24:30] <antto> well i think last time (9->10) i did go and open the upgrade instructions in firefox and then opened a terminal below it so i can read off of the page and started punching in the commands
[00:24:46] <antto> and then probably something bad happened
[00:25:25] <somiaj> yea that is where you might have issues, if the DE crashes during the upgrade you'll loose the terminal, hence why dropping to a tty is suggested
[00:29:03] <greycat> I'd be more concerned about some subtle DE upgrade thing that breaks because it tries to write a file in your home dir after part of the DE was ugpraded, but not the whole DE, or... yuck, just so many complex moving parts.
[00:29:43] <greycat> If you're worried about a terminal window crashing in the middle, you can alleviate that with tmux or screen.
[00:30:32] <antto> nah nah, imma read the upgrade instructions from another machine (this one)
[00:31:23] <antto> (i have two computers, at least one of them must work at all times so i can have any chance to fix the other one)
[00:32:14] <antto> so imma try upgrading the least significant one first, then this one, then the two debians i use at $job
[00:32:22] <antto> that'd be next week tho

[03:00:30] <sussudio> Cool_Fire: the first google result suggests restarting apache2.
[03:00:33] <PMT> Cool_Fire: that's exciting. it's been restarted?
[03:00:42] <maxtim> i personally don't know, but there is also an apache irc
[03:01:05] <Cool_Fire> The problem persists after restarts
[03:01:45] <PMT> how about a stop and start?
[03:01:54] <sussudio> Cool_Fire: disable all modules and reenable them one by one until you get the errors again.
[03:02:23] <Cool_Fire> PMT: afaik that's what sysctl restart already does, but I'll double-check to make sure
[03:02:39] <PMT> Cool_Fire: i would hope so, but i don't like betting on what things do.
[03:04:05] <Cool_Fire> Double-checked, same result.
[03:04:38] <Cool_Fire> sussudio: I'm going to try something along those lines, but not on the production server where I have the issue
[03:04:58] <Cool_Fire> Setting up a vagrant box to see if I can reproduce it there
[03:05:06] <PMT> did it not crash like this on your test system?
[03:05:15] <maxtim> you could try uninstall/reinstall
[03:05:25] <somiaj> Cool_Fire: you cna try to manually downgrade back to 2.4.48-3.1 by 'apt install apache2=2.4.48-3.1' and see if the problems go away, if so maybe you have some regression.
[03:06:12] <Cool_Fire> somiaj: Also something I'd rather try on a test system, since it wants to remove a bunch of dependencies when downgrading for some reason
[03:06:24] <PMT> that's alarming.
[03:06:45] <somiaj> ahh yea, I'm not sure what is the best approach here if this is a production system. I don't seem to notice any issues with the security update personally
[03:07:47] <PMT> though at the point where your production system is crashing on every connection, some degree of stop the bleeding seems like it might apply.

[04:41:02] <jcbjoe2021> When you do apt search <name> I know it does a regex search and I can get lots of results how can I run the apt search command and get exact results? Is there a guide or a tips and tricks guide man apt doesn’t tell me this
[04:42:04] *** Parts: plebe (~user@gateway/tor-sasl/plebe) ()
[04:43:35] <awal1> for me your question is not clear
[04:44:20] <Cool_Fire> you can "apt search --names-only something" to limit to searching package names. That might be good enough
[04:44:22] *** Quits: N3X15 (~nexis@mail.nexisonline.net) (Quit: ZNC - http://znc.in)
[04:45:45] <awal1> oh, i ghet it now. he means get results only for the specified "name"
[04:46:32] <awal1> jcbjoe2021, i personally prefer aptitude when searching stuff

[04:47:12] <awal1> dpkg: aptitude search
[04:47:12] <dpkg> aptitude search is a powerful searching facility that by default only searches package names, but can be made to search priorities, installation status, dependencies etc.  See /usr/share/doc/aptitude/html/en/ch02s04.html (aptitude-doc package), https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/aptitude/ch02s04s05.html or ask me about <aptitude docs>.

[04:48:24] <greycat> if you know the exact package name already, just do "apt show pkgname"
[04:52:02] <awal1> i like the fact that aptitude has these lines " State: installed/not installed Automatically installed: yes/no "
[04:52:41] <awal1> faster to deduce than apt/apt-cache

[05:34:43] <somiaj> I write a small xorg.conf.d/snippet.conf to configure the monintors

[05:35:44] <awal1> i use startx sometimes yeah but i like 'wdm' so i use it sometimes too.
[05:35:49] <awal1> the problem is:
[05:36:21] <awal1> i can't figure out why the mouse pointer is sent to the second monitor when i login in my openbox
[05:36:33] <awal1> if i use startx ^
[05:36:50] <awal1> that happens for you too?

[05:43:38] <awal1> yes, the second is bigger
[05:43:48] <awal1> it is a samsung tv
[05:43:50] <somiaj> it could be that things are just being positioned at the 'center of the viewport'

[13:05:59] <antto> so i'm taking simplified notes https://paste.debian.net/1214840/ because i gotta upgrade a bunch of other debians later too
[13:06:47] <antto> i'm at "4.2.7. The security section" in the upgrade docs
[13:07:30] <antto> is this where i'm supposed to edit sources.list and start changing it to look like debian11 sources.list?
[13:08:24] *** Quits: Vizva (~vizva@gateway/tor-sasl/vizva) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:08:31] <PMT> I believe that's 4.3
[13:08:52] <PMT> But the order doesn't really matter if you're not running apt update in the middle.

[13:09:26] <antto> i did run apt update earlier as you can see in the paste
[13:10:00] *** Joins: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[13:10:03] <PMT> to be more precise, "if you do not run apt update between the start and end of editing sources.list, it does not matter what order you edit it in"
[13:10:04] <antto> okay, so at this point the next things i do are dpkg --audit and so on..?
[13:10:21] <antto> ah, right, i haven't touched sources.list yet
[13:10:47] <antto> btw, does my paste look okay-ish?
[13:11:53] <PMT> I'd probably suggest backing up everything, not just /etc and /var/lib/dpkg, if you're really afraid of something going awry - after all, while your precise configs are important, restoring them alone if everything breaks isn't going to be especially helpful. :)
[13:12:25] <PMT> (Everything here meaning "the OS install", not "your homedir", unless you're for some reason worried about that being set on fire.)
[13:12:40] <PMT> That's not Debian-specific advice, though, that's just my general suggestion.
[13:12:49] <antto> yeah
[13:13:44] <antto> i'm trying to follow the upgrade procedure but it's very long, i found upgrade tutorials on 3rd-party websites which are super oversimplified
[13:14:24] *** Quits: J-BBB (~J-BBB@2001:41d0:2:355f::1) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:14:40] <antto> need something inbetween (so i'm writing it) that i can use for later (my other debian10s are maybe gonna be more tricky to upgrade)
[13:14:40] <PMT> The actual steps involved aren't that long. It's just also a bunch of explanation of what's going on.
[13:14:51] *** Joins: J-BBB (~J-BBB@2001:41d0:2:355f::1)
[13:15:44] <antto> yeah, but in my other debians i do have stuff from backports, and stuff that was made with.. game-data-packager (or how was it called) and installed with gdebi probably
[13:15:56] <PMT> Never heard of that one.
[13:16:13] <PMT> Clearly I'm not playing the right games.
[13:16:15] <antto> so i'm 99.8% sure those oversimplified tutorials will get me in trouble with that
[13:16:26] <antto> PMT it was for quake3
[13:16:45] <PMT> It looks like g-d-p just makes packages of game data without any interesting dependencies or anything, so I don't know that the upgrade process would really care.
[13:17:05] <PMT> And things from actual backports should be fine, since it's Debian n+1 versions, and you're upgrading from n to n+1.
[13:17:15] <antto> ioquake3 as the engine, then the game data of actual quake3 (the .pak file) is turned into a .deb package that can be installed)
[13:18:52] <PMT> If you grabbed some bookworm or sid packages or backported some yourself, that might get dicey, but in general, "just" using backports should be fine.
[13:19:53] <antto> okay
[13:20:50] <antto> i did have some sketchy moments with those same debians when i did the 9->10 so i remember that the upgrade can be really simple, or not so smooth depending on that
[13:21:16] <antto> thus i upgrade the "simpler ones" first now
[13:21:45] <PMT> Sure. Always good to test before doing it on (presumably) more important systems, no matter how much you trust it.

[15:20:23] <antto> so i proceed with this "minimal system upgrade" but it mentions something about SSH
[15:20:26] <antto> "If you are upgrading remotely, be aware of Section 5.1.23, “No new SSH connections possible during upgrade”. "
[15:21:18] <antto> i'm directly on the computer, however, i do have one debian on a server at digitalocean which i'll upgrade later.. over ssh i guess
[15:21:29] <antto> do i skip the minimal system upgrade there?

[15:23:09] <antto> yeah but.. i still don't get it

If you just naively upgrade all the things at once, this period is longer than it often is.

[15:30:26] <antto> PMT: "In some cases, doing the full upgrade (as described below) directly might remove large numbers of packages that you will want to keep.

[15:31:26] <PMT> that is correct.

[15:31:57] <antto> i don't know
[15:32:46] <antto> i did not conclude i should skip it, i thought it is possible to be skipped in certain conditions (and might actually be a good idea to be skipped then)

[15:33:58] <antto> okay, so i've made the wrong conclusions

[16:24:01] <PMT> "do it properly" and "install sid on buster" do not belong together.
[16:24:13] <PMT> sid is not testing.
[16:24:19] <Khepra> !ssb
[16:24:19] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[16:24:26] <Khepra> that's the only "properly" in this context ^^^^

[18:17:29] <mattb0ne> well I have this issue with my laptop screen being broken so I can only use the bottom half
[18:17:49] <mattb0ne> I need to do some work and so I want to clone my laptop screen to my 2nd monitor
[18:17:57] <mattb0ne> the problem is the hdmi port is not sending a signal
[18:19:09] <mattb0ne> I have been lookin online and it has to do with a conflict with intel owning the hdmi and nvidia doing everything else or something like that
[18:19:21] <mattb0ne> and the only way around it is to i guess have nvidia drive the port
[18:19:29] <mattb0ne> so trying to get that working
[18:19:36] <PMT> i believe the usual implementation, last i looked, is that the dGPU manages the port even if you're on integrated graphics
[18:19:47] <mattb0ne> i think i had nouveau installed
[18:20:15] <mattb0ne> yeah there was something wrong with that setup and the driver support there are a few threads on the nividia forums
[18:20:33] <PMT> (or maybe vice-versa? i forget, either setup seems flawed in some ways conceptually.)
[18:20:52] <mattb0ne> so struggling to get this working so I can get my work done
[18:21:11] <mattb0ne> or at least get the crtitical stuff off and then probably sunset this lap top
[18:21:25] <PMT> did you try setting up just intel to drive it, presuming this is intel+nvidia?
[18:22:09] <mattb0ne> that is my set up and that is what I have been trying hasnt been working
[18:22:17] <mattb0ne> so I was trying to get nvidia to own the port
[18:22:30] <mattb0ne> but I always have mesa drivers running things per glxinfo
[18:22:44] <mattb0ne> OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630 (Coffeelake 3x8 GT2)
[18:23:00] <mattb0ne> xrandr always shows disconnected
[18:23:04] <PMT> would suggest looking in Xorg over asking glxinfo, personally, but.
[18:23:24] <PMT> Xorg.log, rather.
[18:23:30] <mattb0ne> i thought the port might be broken but I saw the icon flash for a second so there is some conflict
[18:23:48] <mattb0ne> not sure how to resolve though so I was flinging crap at the wall at this point
[18:23:53] <PMT> it could still be broken in that case, but maybe. can you get it to output through the HDMI port before it gets into the oS?

[18:52:26] <Wyzard> Does "apt update" have a waiting period where if it's checked for updates recently, it won't actually contact the servers again?
[18:52:48] <PMT> i believe if you actually say "apt update" it will always obey you.
[18:52:56] <Wyzard> I've updated several systems to 11.1 today, but I had one VM where "apt update" insisted everything was up-to-date even though it was still running 11.0
[18:53:15] <Wyzard> I deleted /var/lib/apt/lists and ran update again, and *then* it noticed there were updates available
[18:53:17] <PMT> mirrors don't necessarily all sync at the same rate or time, I believe.
[18:53:24] <PMT> that's curious.
[18:53:34] <mattb0ne> would dmesg have info on hdmi port
[18:53:46] <PMT> possibly, but it may or may not be useful.
[18:54:24] <PMT> for instance, my desktop with an NVIDIA card and an HDMI port or four only mentions wiring up the HDMI audio devices in dmesg.
[18:54:25] <mattb0ne> brb reboot
[18:54:30] <mattb0ne> wish me luck
[18:54:30] <Wyzard> I thought it might be just an out-of-date mirror, since I first tried to update less than an hour after the email announcing 11.1 went out, but I've tried several more times since then, and it still didn't see the update until I deleted /var/lib/apt/lists

[18:59:02] <PMT> what were you trying
[18:59:25] <randall> Wyzard: I'm guessing that it's coincidence, and you hit an updated server after deleting the files. deb.debian.org is a load balancer that will redirect you to a (random) mirror near you.
[18:59:29] <PMT> Wyzard: i would speculate that when you try later, it will indeed just work, since whatever transient state you were hitting will have expired.

[19:00:35] <randall> Wyzard: apt goes by timestamps, so if the server says it has been updated at time X that's what apt will go with. There's no waiting period programmed into that tool.
[19:00:40] <PMT> randall: well, a random mirror from a big CDN, not a random mirror from the list of mirrors you'd find by looking at, say, the package or CD download page.

[19:01:21] <randall> You can verify that by turning on wireshark and then running `apt update`.
[19:01:47] <Wyzard> I've run "apt update" on that VM like five times in the past two hours and it never saw 11.1 available; meanwhile I updated to 11.1 on four other systems in the same time period, so it'd have to be a pretty big coincidence for this particular VM to always get load-balanced to the outdated mirror when nothing else does

[19:02:59] <Wyzard> No, it's correct

[19:17:26] <Wyzard> @duszek, if you're familiar with LVM, you can shrink your LV to less than 500GB using lvreduce with the --resizefs option (--resizefs is very important, otherwise you'll destroy your filesystem), then set up an encrypted PV on the new disk and move the LV over with lvmove

[19:18:09] *** Joins: nssy (~nssy@user/nssy)
[19:18:27] <Wyzard> You can't shrink a filesystem while it's mounted, so you'll need to boot from something other than the 1TB disk in order to do that (e.g. Debian Live from a USB drive)
[19:19:15] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@135.129.113.40)
[19:19:55] <Wyzard> Alternatively you could create a new encrypted filesystem on the smaller disk, boot Debian Live or whatever and mount both filesystems, and copy everything over with "cp -a"
[19:20:34] <Wyzard> In either case you'll need to install GRUB on the new drive too, and probably make an EFI boot partition unless you're using legacy BIOS booting
[19:21:04] <duszek> Wyzard: efi boot partitions are waste of space
[19:21:09] <Khepra> does -a preserve xattrs?
[19:21:25] <Wyzard> Moving an OS installation to a different drive is kinda complicated, and the fact that it's encrypted is really just a minor part of that (a few extra steps)
[19:21:43] <Khepra> manpage says it implies --preserve=all, so I guess that's a "yes"

[19:25:16] <Wyzard> but in a nutshell: understand what partitions you have, partition the new disk as appropriate, move filesystems over in some way (either with mkfs and "cp -a", or pvmove if you're on LVM, or even just dd the partition as long as you've shrunk it to be no bigger than the destination partition), then install bootloader on the new disk

[19:28:33] <kittonian> hi all. I've had a deb server for 20 years running iptables with the spamhaus droplist and geoip. i'm finally bringing up a new server from scratch to replace this old box and it was recommended that instead of iptables I should use shorewall. However, it doesn't seem to be in active development and I haven't found anything that says shorewall is better than iptables because of X. Wanted to get some thoughts on the best firewall
[19:28:33] <kittonian>  solution for this new server

[19:29:29] <Khepra> kittonian: shorewall is just a high level wrapper for iptables. if you know iptables, use iptables. these days default for iptables is to use the nftables backend so that's an added bonus
[19:30:12] <Khepra> meanwhile... spamhaus instrumented firewall rules? that's insane. I thought I was an email policy nazi.... but this takes the cake :)
[19:30:56] <kittonian> hehe, yes, i do everything possible to block spammers
[19:31:22] <kittonian> so iptables with nftables is the correct solution
[19:31:25] <kittonian> not shorewall
[19:31:41] <Khepra> this is not about "correct".
[19:32:04] <Khepra> shorewall is just a higher level wrapper. like ufw. or firewalld even (though that has other facets, like dbus)

[19:32:26] <Wyzard> I haven't used shorewall in many years and I don't know what the modern recommendation would be, but that sort of tool is really just an iptables rules generator

[19:32:57] <Wyzard> Instead of writing iptables rules directly, you write a file that says what the firewal policy is (e.g. what ports to allow, that sort of thing) and it runs the iptables commands to implement that policy
[19:33:02] <Khepra> kittonian: some would say go straight for nftables new syntax, because something something iptables will be deprecated in unknown number of years.
[19:33:17] <Khepra> but meanwhile, if you're familiar wiht iptables, use iptables.
[19:33:23] <kittonian> ok, next question. i've always done everything with iptables via the command line and scripts, but it would be great to make it a bit more user-friendly and add a web interface to the equation. is there one that you would recommend?
[19:33:48] <Wyzard> a web interface for editing firewall policy?

I found that it's hitting deb.debian.org with an If-Modified-Since header of "Sat, 09 Oct 2021 09:51:43 GMT", which gets me a 304 Not Modified...  but if I use a timestamp even one second earlier than that, I get a release file with a Last-Modified of "Sat, 09 Oct 2021 09:51:43 GMT" -- exactly the same thing

[19:47:16] <kittonian> PMT, the drop list is an automated script that updates iptables a few times per day. can nftables use the exact same commands as iptables? from my reading it looked like they simplified things in nftables

[19:47:57] <Khepra> kittonian: ideally you'd do it with ipsets, which are usable by both iptables and nftables frontends
[19:48:10] <PMT> Wyzard: that's good work.
[19:48:19] <kittonian> PMT, ahh, i see what you mean. Khepra was suggesting to perhaps use nftables instead of iptables

[19:48:41] <Khepra> kittonian: in fact, I specifically said use iptables if that's what you're used to.
[19:49:04] <kittonian> apologies, i thought you were saying that iptables may be deprecated in so many years so some people are using nftables as the total solution
[19:49:04] <Khepra> if you want to go nft proper, fine. that's all your call. you ain't losing anything with iptables frontend.
[19:49:14] <kittonian> perhaps "recommended" was the wrong word
[19:49:29] <kittonian> err "suggested"
[19:49:37] <PMT> Khepra: does the wrapper still have to set/unset the entire rules list at once like old iptables, or is it better than that?
[19:49:38] <kittonian> so that's the path i was going down
[19:50:06] <Khepra> yea, some people would suggest go straight for nft as that's poised to replace iptables fully. but then eBPF is poised to replace nft, and  QuantumPacketTilter (sic!) is poised to replace BPF in 2057.  always something replacing something.  use what you're most comfortable with ;)

[20:08:59] <mattb0ne> how can I force the driver to be loaded
[20:10:01] <Khepra> if it doesn't do it automatically, you probably have an issue that prevents it to load at all. `apt-cache policy nvidia-driver` will tell you which version is selected
[20:10:29] <antto> "aptitude purge '~o'" tells me that i am trying to remove the kernel i'm still using at the moment and this can potentially make the system unbootable, i can abort it.. can't i remove the old kernel afterwards, when the debian is 11 already and running the new kernel?
[20:10:32] <Khepra> mattb0ne: so that's backported 5.10 on buster?
[20:10:42] <PMT> antto: you can, yes.
[20:11:35] <PMT> you may note those instructions are under "after the upgrade, preparing for the next" - that is, things you can do to be ready for when you eventually upgrade to debian 12.
[20:12:18] <antto> *shrug*

[21:43:33] <co0n> Since we are talking about snaps (sry), what is the truth behind this recent statement on the nextcloud-snap's github issues, regarding debian dangerous to run snaps: https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap/issues/1852#issuecomment-927129765 According to what I could read, this should be a solved problem here as well?

[21:44:31] <co0n> My question is primarily about bullseye, to narrow it down...
[21:45:41] <Wyzard> Well, that kind of "snap" is a containerization thing, unrelated to storage snapshots
[21:45:42] <Khepra> co0n: he probably means that debian previously used to disable USER_NS because it was a rather... insecure kernel feature, but that's no longer the case with bullseye.   this is just my assumption what could be the context of that post
[21:46:04] <Wyzard> I don't know about nextcloud in particular, but Snap is an Ubuntu thing and there's been a lot of criticism over it in general
[21:46:07] <Khepra> without USER_NS, you can't run unpriv containers that require effective uid=0 for whatever purpose
[21:46:19] <Khepra> snapd is cross platform

[21:47:59] <co0n> Wyzard, as far as I can see, this is regarding snap confinement, see https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement . afaict, they are heavily relying on AppArmor and kyrofa, himself a snapcraft dev, hints at Debian not being able to provide strict confinement, which is the only confinement worthy of the word.
[21:48:31] <Khepra> debian supports and defaults to apparmor enabled. not sure what you mean by that
[21:48:37] <PMT> co0n: maybe ask for more details from them? we can speculate, but they know for certain.
[21:49:09] <PMT> (what they meant, that is - not necessarily that they're a general truth oracle.)
[21:49:34] <co0n> I probably should, but I feel like I should counter this with a clear "No, this works as expected", but I will probably have to do some tests myself.
[21:50:22] <co0n> I just hoped someone remembered a point in time where this changed for Debian, that I can rely on for further research. Thanks for the attention, though ;)
[21:50:42] <Khepra> co0n: problem is, "this" has to be defined properly
[21:50:47] <PMT> It's hard to answer "when/did X change" without X
[21:51:41] <PMT> So I suggest if you're concerned, you should inquire precisely what they're alleging, then research it.
[21:52:25] <co0n> Full AppArmor isolation for snapcraft is "this", I recall that there where canonical additions done to accomplish strict confinement previously, I'd like to find the point where this was no longer necessary. (Beware I'm using only my own unreliable human memory here.)

[23:13:53] <peac> it seems these deps are needed, they seem to be maintained by the podman devs themselves

[23:40:19] <peac> just so you know why i bothered, podman is docker's open-source alternative and it supports inter-container networking on arm since 3.2 only, and that's an important security feature to avoid using the host's networking
[23:42:15] <Khepra> well it's always host's networking, those are namespaces, not VMs

[23:43:09] <peac> i meant to avoid exposing ports to outside and instead talk on an internal network
[23:43:15] *** Joins: monoxane75 (~monoxane@119-18-17-227.771211.mel.static.aussiebb.net)
[23:44:48] <Khepra> well... packet filters.
[23:46:06] <peac> that would mean leaving the ports open but refusing packets from outside, allowing packets from podman subnets ?
[23:46:59] <peac> i forgot there's no subnets i guess, so allowing packets from localhost only
[23:47:08] <Khepra> "ports open" is a bit of a misnomer. there's no such thing, really. ports are "open" when something listens on them. if not, there's no port
[23:47:47] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@172.56.2.32)
[23:48:11] <peac> good to know! but if something listens and rejects outside packets, can we still call that open ?
[23:48:28] <Khepra> and that also depends on which interface something listens on.   I'm just not sure this is worth the hassle bringing in podman. you can get teh same level isolation with any container tech
