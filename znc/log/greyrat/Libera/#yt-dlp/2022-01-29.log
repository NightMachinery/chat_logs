[00:30:36] <an3223> is it possible to prepend multiple video codecs to the sort order? i would like "h265 > h264 > default" so i can get hardware acceleration whenever available

[00:38:39] <ede> > for example -f 22/17/18 will download format 22 if it's  avail[â€¦]
[00:40:01] <ede> > Eg:  +codec:avc:m4a  (equivalent  to +vcodec:avc,+acodec:m4a)  sets the video codec preference to h264 > h265 > vp9 
[00:40:07] <ede> an3223, does this look good?
[00:46:29] <an3223> ede: your first message was cut off with a [...] at the word "available"
[00:46:51] <ede> yeah, because it goes on like this
[00:47:10] <an3223> okay, i'm confused then

[00:52:23] <ede> the 2nd solution could be what you're looking for. listed under Sorting Formats, but not sure if it doesn't also influence the selection order
[00:52:44] <ede> didn't even use most of youtube-dl's options, yt-dlp added a ton more it seems
[00:53:27] <ede> (bv*+ba/b)[protocol^=http][protocol!*=dash] / (bv*+ba/b)
[00:53:36] <ede> i mean, this format string looks like python already

[00:54:40] <ede> best h264, else best other -> '(bv*+ba/b)[vcodec^=avc1] / (bv*+ba/b)'
[00:54:56] <ede> so / seems to be the operator
[00:56:49] <an3223> i mean i can do "-S vcodec:avc" (or substitute avc with any other codec) and if it's available then that's the codec i get, but i can't find a way to define a fallback if that codec isn't available
[00:57:41] <an3223> maybe format selection is the better way to do this
[00:58:41] <ede> with the / it seems. first / second / third / ....
[00:59:19] <an3223> yeah i understand format selection, i'll try that out instead

[01:19:50] <an3223> okay, i think i've settled on (bv*[vcodec^=hevc]/bv*[vcodec^=h265]/bv*[vcodec^=avc]/bv*[vcodec^=h264])+ba/bv*+ba/b
[01:25:50] <ede> bv*[vcodec^=hevc/h265/avc/h264] would also be nice for such a series
[01:25:58] <ede> no idea if it works, but would be nice
[01:28:09] <an3223> or something like "-S vcodec:hevc:avc"
