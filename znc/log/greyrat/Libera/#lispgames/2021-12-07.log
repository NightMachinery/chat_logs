[22:57:57] <artchad> @borodust: I have a new name. I used to go by the name "decent-username". What's this new "alien-works" thing?
[22:58:44] <artchad> I wanted to try notalone-thriced, but I can't pull alien-works from quicklisp.
[23:08:24] <artchad> I'm just getting back into lisp, and none of my code works anymore. > . < That happens if we depend on external tools and libraries outside the Lisp eco system.
[23:10:14] <pjb> artchad: I guess you used scheme.  That's what happens with scheme. This is why I switched to Common Lisp in 1996.  Since then, each time I came back into lisp, my old code still worked.
[23:10:44] <pjb> artchad: http://informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/wang.html
[23:29:01] <artchad> pjb, I've never really used scheme outside of SICP.
[23:29:21] <artchad> I was referring to the trivial-gamekit and cl-bodge.
[23:30:08] <artchad> Whenever I come back from a hiatus, those systems tend to not load or compile properly.
[23:31:03] <artchad> I will eventually do all my development on OpenBSD, so I can make sure my code is simple as possible. (If it runs on OpenBSD, it runs everywhere.)
[23:32:50] <artchad> borodust currently focuses on claw and alien-ware as it seems. 
[23:33:49] <artchad> I myself wanted to start writing some games using sdl2kit.
[23:35:14] <artchad> Haven't tested it yet, but it only depends on (:alexandria :sdl2 :cl-opengl :defpackage-plus), so that's promising.
[23:35:43] <artchad> the list of dependencies that alien-works lists is scary. xD
[23:41:01] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:42:54] <pjb> Yes, these kinds of dependencies tend to evolve a lotâ€¦
