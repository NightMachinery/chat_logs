[01:12:28] <semiote> [General] EnableNetworkConfiguration=false ?
[01:12:39] <demize> Does that work?  It's not a documented option.
[01:12:59] <demize> Oh, I misread what you actually wrote, hah.
[01:13:17] <demize> But presumably they want it to do it if they have it set up.
[01:13:21] <Furai> sheep, MrElendig, thx, fixed. I've added that --removable option to hopefully not run into same issue. Though I don't understand it exactly. It will install efi stuff in some 
[01:13:26] <Furai> safe place, right?
[01:13:30] <semiote> iwd should be expecting something else (systemd/networkmanager/dhcpcd etc) to be handling that by default.
[01:13:36] <Furai> but I'll still have to regen efi vars once I boot?
[01:14:03] <sheep> Furai: the --removable option saves it to the standard boot location so that the firmware will try to load that if no EFI boot variables are set
[01:14:41] <semiote> if you're using a laptop on standard wifi networks only, then iwd is quite a nice all in one solution.

[01:15:21] <Furai> sheep, sill not sure what that means. Then I'll be able to boot without uefi enabled in case of overwritten efi vars?
[01:15:25] <MrElendig> I wonder if they have fixed the ipv6 support in iwd, it was utterly broken when I tried it last
[01:15:29] <sheep> Furai: no, you must have UEFI enabled

[01:19:33] <sheep> the EFI boot entries are in EFI variables stored there. The entries just say something like "load the file /efi/boot/bootx64.efi from the GPT EFI System partition with GUID xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx", and the actual files that contain the executable code for the boot entry are in the EFI system partition
[01:19:38] <Furai> I guess I'll do more reading. Just thought its like this cause after mounting efi partition it was empty.
[01:20:11] <thurstylark> believe it or not, we're in support of the learns, so nbd :P
[01:20:24] <thurstylark> teach a man to fish, and all...
[01:20:46] <sheep> it's not supposed to be empty if you were booting from that
[01:20:47] <pdxleif> demize: Thanks, yeah. The only "network" options I see for it's built-in DHCP client seem to be EnableIPv6, which resolver you want to use (resolveconf or systemd), RoutePriorityOffset, and MulticastDNS. Think I'll try going back to having a separate dhcpclient service running... or figure out networkd, or, delete the resolv.conf symlink
[01:22:20] <Furai> Anyway guys, thank you for all your help today! I'm off for the day and I'll continue no this tomorrow, mostly moving other stuff from my work PC to this one. I'm sure I'll encounter more issues. Hopefully no more freezes. Cheers!

[01:39:38] <bobsy> the whole configuration eludes me
[01:39:54] <bobsy> i've gotten myself reawlly confused lol
[01:40:12] <thurstylark> what was your ultimate goal? what steps were you taking towards that goal when things went sideways?
[01:40:48] <bobsy> my goal was to send the audio from a sip call to asterisk to the sound card, i achieved that with jack
[01:41:07] <bobsy> but i couldn't get stereo sound so i tried to create the sink
[01:41:12] <bobsy> thats when things went south
[01:41:48] <thurstylark> so what have you done in pursuit of stereo so far?
[01:42:15] <bobsy> i used jack_control to add both playback_0 and playback_1 to the PJSIP:output, that worked
[01:42:24] <bobsy> but now those playback's dont exist

[01:43:28] <pdxleif> Oh wait, just remembered my DHCP server is my router - and I can change what DNS servers to use there. Seems odd that it's easier to configure my router than my laptop for this, but here we are...
[01:45:11] <MrElendig> pdxleif: advantage is that it applies to all clients if you do it in the router
[01:45:14] <bobsy> and it would be good if i could use LADSPA, DSP and VST, as this is for a FM Radio station to pipe their audio to their tower over the internet and i could do the compression etc

[02:03:14] <bobsy> thurstylark: the problem currently is that the jack/alsa playback ports are now missing

[02:04:08] *** Joins: migul (~mig@user/migul)
[02:04:43] <thurstylark> remember that pw-jack basically wraps whatever it runs in the right env vars to use pipewire, so I think you'll need to run `pw-jack jack_lsp` to see what pipewire is doing
[02:04:45] <bobsy> like, that might be ok, if the pulse/sink thing worked, but i dont know if it does or even how to use it
[02:05:32] <thurstylark> so if you're running asterisk with pw-jack, you'll need to do the same for pretty much anything that wants to talk jack
[02:05:39] <bobsy> it could simply be that i need a Carla config and need to specify the sink as the input for app_jack... dunno...
[02:05:51] <bobsy> thurstylark: yeah i've been doing that.

[03:33:43] <jmcantrell> I'm using iwd for wireless and systemd-networkd, configured according to the wiki, and using the systemd-networkd config files from archiso. Sometimes, when my laptop resumes after being suspended, the network interface does not come back up unless iwd.service is restarted. I'm not sure how to diagnose this. No other device has this problem, and none of them are arch, so I'm guessing that it's not a problem with the router.

[03:52:43] <earnestly> jmcantrell: It may be related but iwd.service has no dependencies on devices being available and so can be quite racy (at least this happens frequently on boot for me).  I mostly solved this by telling the kernel not to rename the nic as that was a common race (udev vs. iwd's .link file).  Another approach is to edit the service and add a dependency on the nic

[04:51:36] <thrice> in general, deviating from the base distro's package manager is probably not great.  If you need that stuff, why not just use nixos?
[04:52:10] <ouestbillie> youre not wrong, was just scanning for other people that would have tried, I use aura right now, I like the idea of having one multilingual package manager instead of coordinating pip cargo etc

[05:06:16] <rwinner> ouestbillie: sounds like something I shoud look into...
[05:06:25] <kaivai> `pip install --user` is useful as an alternative to a system-wide install, but while it does store python-versioned packages, it does not store package-versions separately. If you have two systems that require different versions of the same package your only option (that I'm aware of) is virtualenvs
[05:06:38] <javlock> pythonVERSION -m pip install package
[05:06:43] <jonathon> `python -m venv environment_name` is hella useful

[10:57:53] <CatCatCatCatCat> Hi - I'm reading the wiki page for GRUB, and have a question about the instructions under "Generate the main configuration file": It says to specify the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg when using grub-mkconfig. However, under a UEFI system, the bootloader itself would be installed in /efi, not in /boot. So my question is this: should I have grub-mkconfig place the config file at /efi/grub/grub.cfg, with the bootloader, or 
[10:57:53] <CatCatCatCatCat> at /boot/grub/grub.cfg like normal? It's unclear.

[11:05:24] <NetSysFire> CatCatCatCatCat: no, that note is misleading to many. you usually use /boot even for efi systems
[11:06:22] <NetSysFire> /efi is for stuff when you need to split your esp because it gets too big because of many kernels installed. /boot suffices for almost anyone

I was planning to use /efi because it was the first option listed for a mount location in the UEFI article, and /boot as a mount location seemed to be for more specific cases
[11:10:29] <NetSysFire> yes you should
[11:10:48] <NetSysFire> use /boot unless you specifically know why you want /efi

[11:35:21] <labrador> Is it worth it to run your own email?
[11:35:50] <uuidNuniq> vd: you can create a filter to delete them all.. 
[11:35:59] <vd> not my own email, just a sync of it on my server (primarily because I read them via terminal, then because it acts as backup)

[11:37:01] <vd> I guess my question was more like how long are you supposed to keep an email (assuming you don't back them up) and I'll use this value for the gmail side period
[11:37:17] <vd> legally it's 3 or 6 years apparently

[16:45:03] <grawity> for *some* servers (e.g. the OpenAFS that I'm messing around with), the FQDN & hostname have to be listed with the server's global IP address instead of loopback ... for most web&mail stuff though, a single line is fine, as long as it helps `hostname -f` determine the FQDN

[19:02:41] <MrElendig> is the printer network capable?
[19:02:41] <grawity> usb or network?
[19:02:55] <cznk> usb!
[19:03:02] <MrElendig> if it is not network capable, does it have print from usb/bt?
[19:03:13] <grawity> you have 30 minutes to download and install windows
[19:03:13] <MrElendig> cznk: usb *only* ?
[19:03:24] <cznk> Yes :D Laser Printer from 2010
[19:03:27] <enoq> so containers: is there a non PITA way to host a couple of containers for some web apps that auto update the base image?
[19:03:33] <cznk> (Guy probably stole this from some public sector old office)
[19:03:39] <MrElendig> ms developer vbox image +  usb passtrough
[19:03:47] <cznk> Are you fucking...
[19:03:51] <MrElendig> it works
[19:03:58] <enoq> I know docker/k8s have separate services for base image rebuilding but not hard on hosting k8s as well
[19:04:04] <MrElendig> (assuming you don't have a windows install at hand)
[19:04:12] <demize> Printers are haunted, are you actually surprised?  :p

[19:04:25] <grawity> hmm tbh, does hplip get involved in the usb part, or is it just preprocessing the data?
[19:04:26] <MrElendig> enoq: podman + systemd
[19:04:33] <grawity> haven't used it over usb yet
[19:04:37] <demize> I remember once spending literally months getting CUPS to work with a printer I had.
[19:04:40] <enoq> MrElendig: yeah, but podman doesn't auto rebuild
[19:04:42] <cznk> grawity: I tried cups directly and hplip is segfaulting
[19:04:46] <MrElendig> enoq: hence systemd
[19:04:48] <cznk> and then I intentionally didn't select the "hp"
[19:04:50] <cznk> detected device
[19:05:04] <MrElendig> have it rebuild from time to time
[19:05:04] <cznk> It is detected though
[19:05:07] <grawity> I mean, maybe you could use a generic pcl5 driver *instead of* hplip

[19:05:16] <cznk> grawity: hmmmm
[19:05:25] <Ghosthree3> cznk: might be easier, while probably solvable by the time you work out how the hell to make it work (fk printers), it'll be too late. work it out tomorrow and use windows now if you're able. 30 minutes is pretty tight
[19:05:27] <enoq> something like flatpak would be great
[19:05:29] <grawity> what was it, hpijs or hpcups
[19:05:36] <grawity> or any generic pcl5
[19:05:38] <enoq> having a base system image that gets updates via the package manager
[19:05:47] <cznk> grawity: how would that work?
[19:05:50] <MrElendig> enoq: systemd timer that runs a script which checks for a new update, and if there is one does a podman rebuild
[19:06:10] <cznk> Ghosthree3: I'm going to ask me brother to bring his mac probably :p But they also wanted to see me struggle at this
