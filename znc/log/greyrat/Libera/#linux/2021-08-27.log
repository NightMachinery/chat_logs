[00:00:03] <THE_GFR|WORK> mrfb cool, otherwise I would recommend a frame.work laptop

[00:00:18] <mlu> what I've found is taht any reasonably popular laptop model will work with Linux
[00:00:29] <sumthing1980> hello Ill be running 100s of scripts (webcrawler) and each domain has its own script and output for progress and error, I would like to organize this into preferably having one terminal for each script, I have tried piping to ttys it works great but I would have to manually open 100s of terminal windows and know what each is assigned to what domain do you have ideas on how to approach it
[00:00:30] <THE_GFR|WORK> yea
[00:00:32] <mlu> the internal components and chips tend to all be quite similar anyways
[00:00:41] <mlu> so pick the laptop with the physical design you like the best
[00:00:55] <uwharrie> sumthing1980: I'd use tmux's remote control
[00:00:59] <mrfb> THE_GFR|WORK: yeah, those laptops seems pretty cool, the problem is buying them outside states, warranty and all that[3~

I see that /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 is a symlink to libm-2.27.so and I probably need libm-2.29.so. Can I just copy that file from a newer ubuntu and temporary change symlink for libm.so.6 to point to that file?

[03:11:32] <hajonnes> In gnome, how can I easily maximize a window up and down but not left/right, in the middle of the screen? Does anyone know what this resizing is called? I was thinking of googling it.
[03:11:52] <celeste69> keep in mind by the time i installed arch linux first time I had been using linux for a number of years prior
[03:11:55] <greatcoof> so no clients other than the snap one?

[10:51:56] <Shanzem> You could also focus on a single partition from a drive. The next example does that and also uses bs to set the number of bytes to copy at a single time (4,096, in this case). Playing with the bs value can have an impact on the overall speed of a dd operation, although the ideal setting will depend on your hardware profile and other considerations.

[14:18:29] <jim> the module would be to offer control over that

[16:39:56] <celeste69> LFS = linux from scratch = compiling the kernel
[16:40:04] <|7|> not true. Most hacekrs target web browser or ecosystem (like python repos) - it irrelevant if it is linux or windows if it work. And in times of allmighty near os-like-web-browsers it is easier now as 10ye back, when linux had own browser, windows own and they dont had share a lot of "code".
[16:40:08] <phogg> celeste69: those things are not all equivalent
[16:40:30] <phogg> compiling your own kernel is pretty easy, anyone can do that with a few hours of learning
[16:40:41] <jim> The_Blode_, no, linux from scratch probably requires a few years of experience, including some experience writing programs in C
[16:40:44] <phogg> installing LFS is harder and may require days or weeks, depending on your starting skill level

[16:41:26] <The_Blode_> Understood. I don't program in C. I have the defacto book on C but haven't touched it yet...it seems to be very low level programming and interacting directly with memory.
[16:41:53] <phogg> The_Blode_: in C you do manage memory your self, but it's not *very* low level. That would be asm.
[16:41:59] <The_Blode_> Oh
[16:42:04] <mrfb> learning C is easy. Writing proper C programs is not.
[16:42:12] <The_Blode_> So constructs like conditional ifs and loops will work in C?
[16:42:15] <TheDcoder> +1 mrfb
[16:42:16] <phogg> Which is still a step up from real programming, where you write directly in CPU instructions.
[16:42:29] <phogg> The_Blode_: all programming languages have those
[16:42:30] <TheDcoder> The_Blode_: and much more, C isn't that low-level
[16:42:32] <jim> The_Blode_, if you are going to learn C from that book, you'll need to understand "state machines"
[16:42:35] <The_Blode_> I guess I am used to "C style" constructs
[16:42:51] <phogg> jim: I don't think that's necessary at all
[16:42:52] <TheDcoder> jim: which book?

[16:45:40] <jim> The_Blode_, what dist of linux are you running? (state machines aren't so hard to understand... a state machine is a loop that takes one input per loop, and possibly enters another state as a result of checking the input

[16:46:13] <jim> how do you like it?
[16:46:22] <celeste69> i believe most if not all distros come preinstalled with gcc and make
[16:46:23] <The_Blode_> Personally, it's very nice
[16:46:32] <The_Blode_> What do you think of Mint?
[16:46:33] <gtz> If I start a program with setsid, why doesn't it exit when i close the terminal I started it on? Shouldn't it close because its stdin, stdout and stderr were closed?
[16:46:50] <The_Blode_> celeste69: yes I believe that is the case
[16:46:54] <celeste69> The_Blode_: Iused Mint+XFCE for a couple years it worked for me
[16:46:54] <mrfb> celeste69: Only Fedora (if I'm not wrong) installs dev tools by default
[16:47:03] <The_Blode_> I always considered gcc and make part of the Linux build
[16:47:08] <jim> celeste69, in debian, gcc and make are just packages... sometimes they come in
[16:47:16] <phogg> State machines are an advanced concept. Start with things like output, input, variables, conditions, loops, and functions. Only then worry about state machines. Or, in C, maybe wait until after learning about structs and pointers.
[16:47:35] <jim> in a debian-alike, you can just install them
[16:47:41] <The_Blode_> Thank you yeah just flicking through K&R, it's not that friendly
[16:47:55] <The_Blode_> And I also have the sister book...C++ book
[16:47:57] <clarity> TheDcoder: Starting coding is just a step towards understanding it.  And you can gain understanding from more than just books.
[16:48:05] <celeste69> jim: I wouldn't know what debian does off the top of my head
[16:48:09] <phogg> The_Blode_: GCC is from the GNU project. Linux is sometimes called GNU/Linux because it's typically the GNU programs in user space plus the Linux kernel.
[16:48:10] <The_Blode_> I always see C and C++ like Vi and Vim (but maybe bad analogy)
[16:48:11] <mrfb> K&R is a reference book, In my opinion, probably the one of the worst books to learn from scratch
[16:48:39] <TheDcoder> clarity: that maybe true for other languages, but it is a VERY bad idea to do that in C, you create a lot of misconceptions
[16:48:42] <phogg> The_Blode_: that's not a good analogy
[16:48:48] <The_Blode_> My bad
[16:48:50] <jim> celeste69, gcc and make (among others) come in if you install the build-essential package

[18:22:22] <fakuve> Hi guys , I got a massive glitch in one my systems right now , I have tried to mount an rclone drive , and again some problems , I cannot recall exactly the events that took my to this situation right now (it happened the last few days) but the fact is that now I cannot do `df` or a mere `ls ~/` it will keep frozen the command
[18:22:23] <KSaunder1on> superboot: OK Excellent!

[18:22:28] <superboot> mrfb: Correct.

[18:23:37] <superboot> KSaunder1on: See mrfb's comment about them not being backup. This is because they don't actually copy data, so you only have your data in one place on the disk for the most part, except for the peices that have changed. So if there is file corruption etc, BTRFS can't help you there.

[18:37:54] <azahi> any LD_PRELOAD magic but for some odd reason that executable knows where to link that library from. readelf gives no hard path to the library aside from (RUNPATH) which points to a temporary rpmbuild directory which in turn was used during packaging. How does that executable know from where to get the aforementioned shared library? The location of the library was the same during the linking on the other machine where it was build, if

[22:28:49] <quippy> there was one where eventually I went back and told everyone else reporting the bug how to fix it because I figured it out myself
[22:28:56] <silver> nice work!

[22:29:16] <quippy> I'm not sure which project I need to report this to
[22:29:25] <codebam> quippy: pipewire has been in fedora for like 2 releases now
[22:29:27] <Khaytsus> I would start with Fedora, they do contribute upstream.
[22:29:33] <uwharrie> my usual approach to audio glitches is to disable/uninstall the software mixers and have the audio player use ALSA. might also try increasing the nice/ionice levels of the audio player

[23:54:47] <fuzzybear3965> Here is the command string that I'm using: `xrandr --output DP-2 --auto --above eDP-1-1`
[23:55:01] <fuzzybear3965> And, here's my current xorg.conf : https://pastebin.com/UkN6XDKQ
[23:55:09] <fuzzybear3965> I tried using `DP-2` in the first monitor section, too. It also didn't work.
[23:55:16] <fuzzybear3965> `/var/log/X.log` (or similar) said that there was no known output corresponding to `DP-2`.
[23:55:20] <varaindemian> dragonmaster: thanks!
[23:55:24] *** Quits: meator (~meator@user/meator) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:55:26] <fuzzybear3965> I found `DFP-3` in the logs, and I recognized the information as corresponding to my external monitor (laptop screen is eDP-1-1).
[23:55:35] <fuzzybear3965> I'm kind of stuck. Any advice would be appreciated.
[23:55:39] <varaindemian> TJ-: thank you! Always learning new things from you

[23:56:15] <Psi-Jack[m]> fuzzybear3965: Stick to the facts. What's wrong. What have you done, and what are you trying to do/
[23:56:24] <jim> fuzzybear3965, I have an alternative to pastebin.com, because that site is known to misbehave in several ways...
[23:56:31] <TJ-> varaindemian: it's in the 'keyfile' field of your crypttab
[23:56:35] <fuzzybear3965> jim happy to use it.
[23:56:36] <jim> fuzzybear3965, if you have nc installed, you can pastebin the output of an arbitrary command, for example ls -CF if you run it like this: ls -CF | nc termbin.com 9999
[23:56:46] <Psi-Jack[m]> Simple, No walls needed for that, no out-of-focus things to try to translate.
[23:56:52] <fuzzybear3965> jim Fair enough - I'm not on that machine for now.
[23:57:05] <onelegend> the Jack is now on Matrix
[23:57:31] <onelegend> hows the experience
[23:57:34] <fuzzybear3965> Psi-Jack[m] With my current xorg.conf the displays are mirrord.
[23:57:35] <Psi-Jack[m]> Enter the Matrix. :)

[23:57:46] <fuzzybear3965> I don't want that. I want them extended. (one above/below the other).
[23:57:57] <fuzzybear3965> The `xrandr` command that I gave above *does* do that.
[23:58:05] <Psi-Jack[m]> fuzzybear3965: So, why are you messing with xorg.conf?
[23:58:30] *** Joins: Codaraxis__ (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis)
[23:58:41] <fuzzybear3965> Psi-Jack[m] Because I want my system to be declarative. I want it applied by X at boot, not at user log-in time.
[23:58:50] <[[R]]> i do declare
[23:59:04] <Psi-Jack[m]> fuzzybear3965: ...
[23:59:06] <fuzzybear3965> and, because it's possible and I want to learn how to do it.
[23:59:13] <Jefren2> how did she get back there
[23:59:15] <varaindemian> TJ-: right

[23:59:24] <Psi-Jack[m]> There's definitely ways to still do that without ever touching xorg.conf. Pretty much every distro does this.
[23:59:38] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.205.112)
[23:59:48] <Psi-Jack[m]> Since you say at boot, that means you have a Display Manager, right?
