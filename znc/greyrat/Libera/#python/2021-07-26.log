(maybe i will add one when i'm done). Thanks for the suggestion.

[09:33:38] <nubonix> not really sure whats going wrong with my pyqt5 app, but ill try to explain. So when i start it up, im instantiating the HomePage class and im passing an apscheduler scheduler from the MainWindow class to the HomePage class. When i create a new task on the homepage via pushing a button on the homepage [new task button] it shows the NewTask class [QDialog], and when i press the button Add Task within the NewTask class, it will add a
[09:33:38] <nubonix> task to the gui [QScrollArea, and tasks.json] However, when i try and start the newly created task, it says that self.qtscheduler is a NoneType, meaning that HomePage no longer has access to the passed variable? I am scheduling a new job when the Add Task button is pressed, so im not sure if this is the cause, but it would be my guess and I dont know what to do about it, so i am here :) heres app.py, homepage.py and the traceback i
[09:33:38] <nubonix> am getting from homepage.py
[09:33:41] <nubonix> https://gist.github.com/nubonics/b59eacdcd8337ff9379cbf96c393c977
[09:35:00] <nubonix> adding a task via the Add Task button also schedules the job, but does not start it. there is a play button within the QScrollArea that i can press to resume / start the scheduled job

[11:08:33] <rk4> the error makes no sense to me because i am installing psycopg2-binary,

[11:10:01] <rk4> ah, i made it past that hurdle, i know /var/task is in the sys.path, and the module dir goes in there, the python part of the import is fine, but it dies looking for that so

[12:40:26] <Byteflux> string is iterable so just doing list('abc') is probably the most concise way to do what you asked

[14:56:24] <amogorkon> there's an advantage to that - you do exc = traceback.format_exc() and then check for exc to return a default or re-raise the exception, depending on context
[14:57:22] <amogorkon> if you reraise within the except-block, it will cause python to go "while handling exception X, another exception occurred.."
[14:57:51] <amogorkon> which you can avoid by assigning to a temporary var exc and then deal with that outside the except

[16:28:21] <bjs> sazawal: when you make a Process with target=self.some_method, it has to copy the instance over to the new process.  But you cannot copy stuff that have threading Lock's in them (like a threading Queue)
[16:29:28] <sazawal> bjs, But I am not using any threading Queue for interprocess communication
[16:29:37] <bjs> sazawal: but you are trying to send it to the other process
[16:29:51] <sazawal> All the threading queues are being used internally in the secondary process
[16:30:12] <bjs> sazawal: okay but when you make the secondary Process you're sending over the entire instance, including all the `runnables`

[16:32:01] <bjs> sazawal: but you call a.set() before you run the process
[16:32:19] <sarna> hey, under which circumstances would I get a set that contains one list, instead of getting a set with elements of the list (the list being flattened)?
[16:32:21] <sazawal> Well, to avoid just this, I replaced all the threading queues to multiprocessing queues and in that case it was working. But then I stumbled upon the maximum multiprocessing queue error.
[16:32:48] <bjs> sarna: never because sets can't contain lists. {[1]} is a TypeError
[16:32:56] <sarna> I create sets the regular way (via something like `set([1,2,3])`), but one of the sets is getting printed like this: `set(["foo", "bar"])`
[16:33:14] <sazawal> Yes I called all the a.set to set up the queue piplelines, and then started the secondary process. Hmm, I am not sure what is a better way to do this.
[16:33:16] <sarna> bjs: so if it prints with a list inside, it means nothing?
[16:33:33] <bjs> sarna: oh, set(["foo", "bar"]) is the same as {"foo", "bar"} there is no list
[16:33:35] <grawity> that's just how it prints itself, set() takes an iterable

[16:34:06] <sarna> I see, I was confused because it said the first one was not a subset of the second one.. I'll investigate
[16:34:11] <sarna> I'm supposedly on python 3.8 haha
[16:34:19] <bjs> sarna: "supposedly" ?

[17:21:16] <damoreno> Luyin: doesn't seem to care about missing params in the docstring.
[17:21:39] <bjs> HaJo: but as i said it's not designed for writing whole programs. You can use the `interact` pdb command to get a proper interpreter that lets you run Python code a bit easier, and of course you can print out the value of any expression
[17:22:18] <Luyin> damoreno: to be honest, I always simply relied on my IDE for the docstring format 8)
[17:22:24] <HaJo> bjs: hmm, right, 'for line in intf_list: print(line)' works as expected.
[17:22:29] <bjs> (but note that running code from pdb which is inside a function is not the most pleasant experience)

[20:01:50] <SnoopJ> gitesh, "expression" is a name for a piece of syntax (code) that is turned into a value. A function call is one kind of expression, and the value produced is the function's return value.

[22:35:05] <WhyNotHugo> I'd leave the interface question aside, since I can't even remotely agree. :P
[22:35:23] <WhyNotHugo> But that aside, does the open source vs proprietary hold no value in tooling essential for python?
[22:35:35] <ssbr> WhyNotHugo: Python *itself* is on github now.
[22:35:39] <ssbr> so yes, that's correct
[22:35:39] <WhyNotHugo> It just feels like an against-the-current move.

[22:37:54] <WhyNotHugo> Yeah, I know. But switching FROM floss platforms to proprietary ones does make me wonder what the overall direction is.
[22:38:17] <nedbat> WhyNotHugo: don't read too much into it.  They chose the platform that would enable the most collaboration.
[22:38:18] <ssbr> WhyNotHugo: generally speaking, the overall direction is towards proprietary tools for hosting and bug tracking and the like. That's been the direction for many years now.

[22:44:33] <ssbr> ah, "forge software" == "things like sourceforge (RIP)"

[22:47:54] <nedbat> WhyNotHugo: does your email client syntax color code?

[22:49:26] <GNUtoo> (Practically speaking you have a limited time to retrive a mail with a second code, and to some people that puts too much effort and they report less bugs)
[22:49:39] <ssbr> WhyNotHugo: yes, that's why I said it'd be awesome to do a code review tool that was layered on top of email :D
[22:49:45] <ssbr> federated code review, ahoy
