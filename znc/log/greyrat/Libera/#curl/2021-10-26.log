[10:51:36] <icing> "hide security issues" is a good one.
[10:52:04] <icing> "kill off ci jobs" could save the planet - maybe
[10:53:13] <bagder> a tiny bit, yes, but also unblock other CI jobs to run
[10:53:43] <bagder> I've been most annoyed in times with X PRs "in queue" waiting to run their jobs
[10:53:56] <icing> I know the feeling when I stare at the travis apache travis queue and think "wow, just 3 more useless runs to go"
[10:54:22] <bagder> right
[10:55:18] <icing> there is a way to manage that, but so far I have not bothered to make my account priviledge enough or find the place where I can do it.
[11:00:49] <icing> Should I add "the CI job page should have a hidden space invaders game built in"?
[11:02:09] <bagder> its a mystery why that isn't already done!

[17:27:28] <Payam> Hi, I got a response from a rest api and one of the elements in the json response is a url that I need to curl again.
[17:27:38] <Payam> how do I pass a json response to curl again?
[17:28:08] <Payam> I already have my json response configured using jq. and I want to pass them again
[17:28:59] <nimaje> use whatever you use to call curl, I would guess some shell, so just a variable
[17:29:56] <Payam> I wana do a one liner
[17:31:08] <nimaje> no idea what you use to call curl, but in sh that would be possible
