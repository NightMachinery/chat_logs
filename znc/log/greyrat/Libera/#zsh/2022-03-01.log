[02:26:59] <nickdiazswag209> Mikachu: remember you helped me with autocomplete for zsh? instead of always autocompleting based on prefix, e.g. when typing "cd foo<TAB>", it looks for all dirs foo* instead of *foo* first? it actually works. I said it didnt work. But i think its something related to tmux now, but i can't figure out what it is. The way i figured this out was when i opened the terminal in vscode, and intellij, it 
[02:27:05] <nickdiazswag209> works
[02:29:38] <nickdiazswag209> actually its not tmux
[02:29:47] <nickdiazswag209> just tried it outside of tmux, and it also fails, i believe its actually iterm2 now
[02:30:17] <nickdiazswag209> nope, not iterm2 either, because trying it in terminal also fails

[02:32:00] <nickdiazswag209> ahhh now it fails everywhere! something must be triggering it :P
[02:34:31] <nickdiazswag209> ahhhh i think i figured out what does work... when i type cd `foo<TAB>` it doesnt work to find my-foo-dir, but when i try it from another directory, like this `cd ~/tmp/foo<tab>`, it works, its able to find `~/tmp/my-foo-dir`
[02:35:01] <nickdiazswag209> any idea why it wont work if i'm within `~/tmp` and just typing cd foo<tab>? it works when i do it from another directory and do `cd ~/tmp/foo<tab>`

[05:04:30] <pr3d4t0r> Weird zsh issue:  The ., -, + keys are remapped to m, n, l after loading .zshrc + $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh in a new shell.  The correct mappings are used if no .zshrc is loaded.  If .zshrc is available inside a shell started from vim via :term the key mapping is correct.  I've isolated the issue to loading oh-my-shell.sh; no issues when loading bash + .bash_profile with identical aliases and exports to
[05:04:32] <pr3d4t0r> .zshrc.  Please advise on how to troubleshoot and fix, thanks in advance.
[05:06:04] <pr3d4t0r> Environment:  macOS Big Sur latest, with zsh 5.8, brand new installation of oh-my-zsh a couple of hours ago.
[05:07:10] <phy1729> !omz
[05:07:11] <machabot> "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the discord https://discord.gg/ohmyzsh or https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/discussions
[05:07:29] <pr3d4t0r> The issue also occurs if zsh is loaded in a shell under GNU screen 4.9.
[05:09:29] <pr3d4t0r> Ah, interesting.  Thanks, phy1729 -- I never liked all the magic in omz; I'll start disabling it, thank you.  I was led to believe by friends who like it that using it is a best practice.  I appreciate the heads up.
[05:10:21] <pr3d4t0r> Rocking, that fixed it.  Thanks!
[05:11:02] * pr3d4t0r heads over to the search engines to learn more about why use/avoid omz.
[05:11:26] <llua> !omzwhy
[05:11:26] <machabot> It is a collection of subpar quality shell scripts that abstracts the configuration of zsh in ways unknown to us (seemingly its users too) and reinvents various features of zsh. All in a effort of providing the mystical "sane default config".
[05:15:56] <pr3d4t0r> llua: Yeah, agreed.  And now that I think about it, the peeps who recommended that are the kind who like abstractingTF out of everything.  The kind of folk who prefer Automator over scripting, or Slack over IRC :P

[22:42:23] <Lyude> Hey - so I ran into a weird issue. Between zsh 5.8 (specifically zsh 5.8-6.fc35 on fedora) and zsh 5.8.1 (zsh-5.8.1-1.fc35), it seems as if zsh subshells suddenly don't work in non-interactive ssh sessions. Example: (LyudeTestTowerGamma is using zsh 5.8.1, LyudeX1Carbon is using zsh 5.8): https://dpaste.com/3NY5289DU 
[22:42:33] <Lyude> Does anyone know how I can fix this, or if this might be a bug with zsh?
[22:43:02] <Lyude> erm, *LyudeX1Nano
[22:44:23] <phy1729> Usually when one says subshell they mean ( this construct; )    I'm not sure what you have there should have ever worked
[22:44:34] <llua> subshells is like the most incorrectly used term in shell scripting
[22:44:43] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors) (Quit: trevors)
[22:47:11] <Lyude> phy1729: the problem is I have a number of scripts that elevate themselves to root by running sudo -s on systems, which doesn't really work if you can't start a zsh instance inside of another one
[22:47:54] <phy1729> I would rewrite those scripts to use more idiomatic constructs

[22:55:34] <llua> its behavior that was pretty suspect to rely on in the first place, since there was no guarantee that the parent process didn't seek further along the file than what was desired.
[22:59:55] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[23:02:20] <Lyude> Wouldn't zsh just be able to interpret seeking too far as reaching the end of the file though? or is there some buffered input thing going on with <<- that I'm not aware of that would break that?
[23:03:13] <Hello71> i'm inclined to say that the shell is required to read one line at a time, or in the worst case, send the buffered input to the subprocess. for example cat > file ENTER contents ENTER CTRL-D must write "contents" to the file
[23:04:10] <phy1729> That's a lot of syscalls for an edgecase noone should use.
[23:04:43] <Hello71> like, interactively
[23:05:05] <Hello71> suppose the system is very slow and does not reschedule zsh for some time
[23:05:47] <Hello71> and i literally type c, then a, then t, etc. i expect "contents" to be written to the file, not executed or something else
[23:06:14] <llua> http://ix.io/3R6T
[23:06:31] <llua> % for s in mksh ksh93 zsh dash bash; do echo $s; printf '%s\n' 'echo Shell is $$' $s 'echo Shell is $$' | $s; done
[23:06:41] <Hello71> you could argue that that only applies with tty input though
[23:07:45] <Lyude> yeah, I would have thought non-interactive would have always at least ensured there's an EOF at the end of input
[23:07:54] <Lyude> which would make lag not really relevant
