[11:58:22] <artchad> The varray.lisp example from the examples/redbook in cl-opengl. uses a call to gl:vertex-pointer, which doesn't exist. So I instead wanted to use %gl:vertex-pointer.
[11:58:50] <artchad> The question now arises: How do I access the opengl enums?
[11:59:12] <artchad> I could just copy the hexcodes from /usr/include/GL/gl.h, but that's not portable.

[12:03:55] *** Joins: ryanbw (~ryanbw@mab.sdf.org)
[12:04:24] <artchad> Also some assertions seem to fail if I try to do that.
[12:09:42] <|3b|> should be able to just use same enums as CL style keywords, so GL_FOO_BAR -> :foo-bar
[12:16:25] <artchad> https://paste.debian.net/plain/1230100
[12:16:39] <artchad> The setup-pointers function is what I've modified
[12:16:45] <artchad> the keywordds don't work either.
[12:16:46] <|3b|> don't write code like varray.c even for gl 2.1 though, use named buffers
[12:17:38] <artchad> I'm following the redbook for opengl 2.1
[12:17:55] <artchad> cl-opengl contains the examples from the book
[12:18:05] <artchad> just lispified
[12:18:10] <|3b|> right, doesn't mean you should do that :p
[12:18:51] <|3b|> but if you really want to, you need to allocate some foreign memory, and either leak it or arrange for it to be freed when you exit the program
[12:18:57] <artchad> Currently I just would like to get things on the screen, so I don't loose motivation.
[12:19:31] <artchad> I guess, I would first have to learn cffi, before I could start learning cl-opengl.
[12:19:33] <|3b|> then fill that foreign memory with data from those 2 arrays, and pass the foreign pointers to the function
[12:19:34] <artchad> I thought as much.
[12:19:47] <|3b|> easiest way would be to use static-vectors lib
[12:20:04] * artchad takes a look at static-vectors
[12:23:44] <|3b|> try https://gist.github.com/3b/9abd76f24efb2154dde4aa332c6b3a18
[12:24:04] <|3b|> (after loading static-vectors)
[12:24:30] <|3b|> that will leave the foreign memory around forever, but it's small enough to not matter
[12:25:12] <|3b|> edited
[12:26:56] <|3b|> though using integers for position is pretty odd, more common to use floats for position and unsigned-byte 8 for color (or float for both)
[12:27:36] <|3b|> edited some more, i can't read/type/cut&paste :/
[12:27:54] <artchad> yeah,the example uses GLint. :/
[12:28:07] <|3b|> did i mention you shouldn't be doing what those examples do? :)
[12:28:37] <artchad> ok, it compiled after I added the vertex size and stride.
[12:28:48] <artchad> |3b|: yes
[12:29:09] * |3b| wonders what's up with gl:vertex-pointer not existing though, i thought the examples at least worked even if they were bad style
[12:29:12] <artchad> you noted it on several occasional, wither explicitly or indirectly. I appreciate your suggestions.
[12:30:02] <artchad> yeah, it doesn't complain when loading :cl-glut-examples, so it might've been missed while the API was adjusted.

[13:09:49] <artchad> |3b|: So instead of using Vertex Arrays, I could always use buffers instead?
[13:17:07] <artchad> Using vertex arrays is complicated. I just skimmed through their explanation.

[13:31:56] * |3b| needs to check terminology, haven't looked at what things are called in GL in a while
[13:32:43] <|3b|> but you shouldn't be passing your own pointers to vertex-pointer like that
[13:33:35] <|3b|> artchad: you are still doing 2.1 style with no shaders, right?
[13:47:58] <artchad> ye
[13:48:05] <artchad> that's glsl 120
[13:50:34] <|3b|> i think you would still be using "vertex arrays", just storing things in GL allocated buffers, with gl:gen-buffers, %gl:buffer-data, etc (not gl:buffer-data, since that was an attempt to abstract the older behavior, which ended up not adapting well to changes in how the API is used now)
[13:52:14] <|3b|> if you were using 3.x+, would also add in "vertex array objects" which makes it easier to keep track of a set of mappings from vertex attributes to buffers instead of having to set each one for every draw
[13:59:38] <|3b|> one of the reasons to avoid learning by following GL spec evolution is that it took them 3 or 4 tries to get all this stuff right, so lots of things changed over time :/
[14:00:22] <|3b|> so better to skip from immediate mode to more modern style if possible and ignore the various failed things (like the style from that varray example)
