[01:35:45] <Cryowolf> on a shitty laptop that cant run anything
[01:38:56] <kariosfox> tbh, not-owning a game is what is both great and terrible about streaming vidya 
[01:39:18] <Cryowolf> you can always go for geforce now
[01:39:23] <Cryowolf> where you stream purchased games
[01:39:52] <kariosfox> that's synonymous with streaming games
[01:39:52] <Cryowolf> but Im not gonna pay a monthly fee for games I own :P
[01:40:09] <Cryowolf> eh?
[01:40:35] <Cryowolf> Theres a ton of games on Game Pass that I don't own a copy of, be it digital or physical
[01:41:18] <Cryowolf> I own the right to play them for the time theyre on there
[01:41:24] <kariosfox> yeah
[01:41:25] <Cryowolf> but theyre not mine
[01:41:35] <kariosfox> i  understand the concept
[01:41:53] <Cryowolf> thats why I pay for game pass and not geforce now
[01:42:09] <Cryowolf> cause geforce now is for streaming games you bought
[01:42:13] <kariosfox> thing is it's not that different from buying the right's to stream a single game
[01:42:23] <Cryowolf> it doesnt have a library to stream from

[01:42:35] <Cryowolf> yes it is
[01:42:50] <amigojapan> Good morning
[01:44:39] <kariosfox> Crywolf: sure the  fact that you have several games a la carte is different from getting rights to individual games being streamed, but what's the same is you're always on a company's whim.
[01:48:04] <Cryowolf> it's CRYOwolf. Also everyone is at some company's whim
[01:48:17] <Cryowolf> all the fucking time
[01:48:38] <Cryowolf> and when it comes to some game on game pass, that's very trivial
[01:49:01] <Cryowolf> when it comes to Steam. They wouldn't suddenly shut down or ban everyone from their business
[01:49:35] <Cryowolf> and theres a clear difference in having bought a game and having bought the rights to play it while it's on game pass
[01:50:09] <kariosfox> Sure.

[02:24:25] <OEIRAS> Originally from San Francisco
[02:24:34] <OEIRAS> but I now live in Los Angeles
[02:24:48] <OEIRAS> experienced first hand the 1992 riots
[02:25:00] <ButterNoodle> was gonna ask that...
[02:25:07] <ButterNoodle> well
[02:25:11] <OEIRAS> yeah it was brutal
[02:25:29] <ButterNoodle> I was alive and watching the news when all that went on.. truly brutal for everyone involved
[02:25:46] <OEIRAS> i still remember this poor korean woman crying that her life savings and her retirement went into her store
[02:25:48] <ButterNoodle> human kind at its worst
[02:26:28] <ButterNoodle> ik.. too many stories of people trying to protect all they had in this world... family and business.. when everything was getting torched
[02:27:06] <OEIRAS> I also remember how they looted a Ralph's, My grandmother took us to the grocery store and when we parked, we saw hordes of people stealing groceries, a lot of them carts filled.
[02:27:11] <ButterNoodle> ig riots are good in a sense.. its kinda a cup check to businesses that think they can operate in areas where people dont give a shit about them
[02:27:27] <OEIRAS> my grandmother quickly changed her mind and went elsewhere further into the suburbs for groceries.

[02:28:46] <OEIRAS> in the 1970s and 1980s, especially during the 1984 Olypics, which we hosted, made the issue worse

[02:28:57] <ButterNoodle> yea LA has been, always be a shit hole of racial tension since the 60s.. probably further back than that tbh
[02:29:02] <OEIRAS> Los Angeles had a period of turmoil after the 1965 riots.
[02:29:07] <OEIRAS> yes
[02:29:10] <ButterNoodle> fax..
[02:29:42] <OEIRAS> since 60s, the city was a boiling pressure cooker
[02:29:56] <OEIRAS> and the 1992 riots was essentially the release of that build up
[02:30:13] <ButterNoodle> truly, if u take the race relations and social/economical differences of the population there... it is the poster child on how not to work with the public
[02:30:42] <OEIRAS> well we have the LAPD, the most corrupt institution in the city
[02:30:48] <ButterNoodle> the police/government/media are all at fault imho
[02:30:56] <OEIRAS> along with the LA City Council
[02:31:01] <OEIRAS> and the mayor
[02:31:05] <OEIRAS> you have problesm
[02:31:16] <OEIRAS> there is a huge disconnect with the citizens of the city
[02:31:20] <OEIRAS> and the ruling class
[02:31:34] <ButterNoodle> that stems from the economic gap
[02:31:51] <OEIRAS> also worth noting....
[02:32:07] <ButterNoodle> people selling their ass, selling drugs to get baby formula... and the people running the show are "let them eat cake"
[02:32:11] <OEIRAS> LA prior to 1992, had a serious control issue in the South LA area.
[02:32:34] <OEIRAS> the selling their asses part is absolutely correct
[02:32:49] <OEIRAS> there was and still an economic difference
[02:33:07] <ButterNoodle> this shit was boiler plate for "control" of the public and the systematic legislation of our rights being taken away
[02:33:12] <OEIRAS> I currently live in the suburbs of LA
[02:33:35] <ButterNoodle> its been 30+ years in the making
[02:33:42] <OEIRAS> my parents left the city of Los Angeles to the suburbs after the riots
[02:33:55] <OEIRAS> they did not want any part of the turmoil 
[02:34:20] <ButterNoodle> dont care ur political affiliation, they use the dangers of the poor and riots to feed into laws that restrict our liberties
[02:34:46] <OEIRAS> and we lived in in Hancock Park, the wealthier neighbourhoods of LA
[02:35:05] <ButterNoodle> yea.. then u have the silicon valley syndrome.. extreme inflation in once rural areas because people dont want to live in a city thats constantly burning itself down

[02:37:06] <ButterNoodle> dang
[02:37:31] <OEIRAS> for a while people had their merchandise from the looted stores
[02:37:41] <OEIRAS> it was actually cheaper to buy clothes

[02:38:05] <ButterNoodle> tru
[02:38:15] <OEIRAS> not condoning it
[02:38:24] <OEIRAS> but there was a flood of looted goods
[02:38:28] <ButterNoodle> I didnt see much of that from these riots.. seemed like people just wanted to break shit
[02:38:41] <ButterNoodle> or kept what they stole

[04:17:08] <Matt|home> i made the mistake of reading the news today..
[04:17:20] <JesseDesu> why what happened
[04:17:22] <JesseDesu> !g cnn.com
[04:17:23] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: CNN - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos <https://www.cnn.com/> | CNN - Home | Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/cnn/>
[04:17:26] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: yea.. you have to turn on file sharing
[04:17:32] <Bco1981> i did
[04:17:33] <ButterNoodle> but
[04:17:51] <Bco1981> and punched holes, and disabled. nothing helps
[04:18:39] <ButterNoodle> yea win10 always shared when I used it
[04:19:14] <ButterNoodle> but talking to pre win7 stuff would be broke dick
[04:20:30] <ButterNoodle> ntlm and smb < v1x is off by default
[04:20:59] <ButterNoodle> also that master browser garbage I think is disabled too
[04:21:02] <Bco1981> if it atleast would just see other windows 10 pc's then. but not even that
[04:21:07] <ButterNoodle> naa
[04:21:14] <ButterNoodle> and use IP addresses
[04:21:31] <ButterNoodle> bc no master browser election by default iirc
[04:21:36] <Bco1981> i do, when it won't use the hostname.
[04:22:03] <ButterNoodle> no mo net boody
[04:22:17] <ButterNoodle> u have a samba server in there?
[04:22:50] <Bco1981> i have two nas?
[04:23:02] <ButterNoodle> curious what kind a noise its making on the network
[04:23:02] <Bco1981> they are probably running samba
[04:24:01] <ButterNoodle> u even wireshark and see what it looked like?
[04:24:11] <ButterNoodle> just wondering what defaults win sets these days
[04:24:17] <ButterNoodle> was it 10 pro?
[04:24:25] <Bco1981> naah, yea 10 pro, and 11 pro
[04:24:37] <ButterNoodle> just odd
[04:25:25] <ButterNoodle> ofc the only 2 fresh win10 installs I have are a laptop and my game box.. and the just talk to the file servers
[04:26:06] <Bco1981> my best nas has "enable local master browser" ticked
[04:26:07] <ButterNoodle> but 1.0 should be disabled...
[04:26:25] <ButterNoodle> its insecure

[06:49:37] <amigojapan> snake:  as far as I understand Schrödinger's cat experiment was not designed to say there can be cats that are both dead and alive at the same time, but just to show how quantum states don't translate to macroscopic objects

[07:20:46] <amigojapan> No Satin shared objects are all supposed to be in a known directory so that every program can use them. This is not Windows
[07:23:41] <Satin> that flag is supposed to work for a reason amigo
[07:23:49] <Satin> anyways someone helped me, it was apparently -L.

[11:01:21] <ImoutoBot> Satin: (133 / 175) <e​mmeka> l​uke-jr the existence of the post office is of great benefit to you and you should probably embrace it. USPS is actually forbidden from carrying over a surplus, any profit it earns goes straight into public coffers. Any success of USPS results in money for the taxpayers, any success of UPS results in money for its shareholders.

[12:23:41] <Berlin36> im ok :D
[12:23:48] <Berlin36> relaxing because it's Sunday
[12:24:04] <Berlin36> yesterday i started reading a book on networking in Go

[12:24:56] <KatrinValerie> You will suffer
[12:25:08] <KatrinValerie> You have been warned

[12:25:25] <Berlin36> :O
[12:25:56] <KatrinValerie> None have returned alive from the path you are about to venture 
[12:26:14] <Berlin36> yesterday i've read about the osi model and those 7 layers
[12:26:18] <KatrinValerie> Also the compiler makes huge binaries
[12:26:35] <KatrinValerie> Nobody does the whole 7 layers ever
[12:26:46] <Berlin36> 4 of them?
[12:26:49] <Berlin36> because of tcp
[12:26:49] <KatrinValerie> it's just a model bro
[12:26:52] <Berlin36> oh
[12:27:03] <Berlin36> i thought it's like a standart 
[12:27:08] <KatrinValerie> You gotta look into actual implementation
[12:27:12] <KatrinValerie> to an extent
[12:27:12] <Berlin36> also i've read about topologies
[12:27:17] <Berlin36> like star topology
[12:27:19] <Berlin36> bus topology
[12:27:27] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[12:27:32] <Berlin36> and 4 more i guess
[12:27:34] <Sadale> have fun learning Berlin36 :3
[12:27:43] <KatrinValerie> I remember those 
[12:27:45] <Berlin36> thank Sadale :D
[12:27:51] <Berlin36> thanks*
[12:27:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KatrinValerie: Go simply makes statically-compiled binaries. All such binaries are comparatively used.
[12:28:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/used/huge/
[12:28:24] <KatrinValerie> Aurora_v_kosmose: that's bad!
[12:28:27] <KatrinValerie> Bad Go!
[12:28:27] <Berlin36> go compiles pretty fast
[12:28:32] <KatrinValerie> Go evil
[12:28:33] <Berlin36> why, KatrinValerie 
[12:28:37] <KatrinValerie> Go is made by evil company
[12:28:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KatrinValerie: Meh, there's pros & cons.
[12:28:53] <KatrinValerie> Only C++ has the comitee
[12:29:04] <KatrinValerie> You should be using standard C++
[12:29:11] <KatrinValerie> It has real standards
[12:29:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Meh. C++ sucks. While as for Go... the only thing I really care about for it is that it brought CSP into mainstream.
[12:29:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> CL > alles

[12:33:16] <Berlin36> xD

[12:33:39] <Berlin36> n o p e
[12:33:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KatrinValerie: C++ is ultimately more limited than Common Lisp.

[12:34:48] <KatrinValerie> Rust may be able to succeed C++ at some point
[12:35:03] <Berlin36> c++ is made for people that have white beards and stuff, that have used those tiny little computers in 70's
[12:35:04] <KatrinValerie> I have yet to properly learn it, but it looks very promising
[12:35:09] <Berlin36> it's hard

[13:42:32] <zoidberg> common!
[13:42:49] <Sadale> zoidberg, if rents were cheaper than house, no one'd buy house and lease it to others.

[13:45:29] <Sadale> zoidberg, yep. Anyway it isn't a clever idea to just pay for the cash upfront. I'd certainly rent first.
[13:45:43] <zoidberg> Sadale: even if you go that way, the interest you get for what you pay for house is more than rent
[13:46:16] <Sadale> zoidberg, There's no way to tell if I'm ok with living in, says, PH without really living there for a while. So for the first few years, it's probably better to rent.
[13:47:13] <zoidberg> Sadale: check the house prices, rents online and see if bank interest is greater than rent 
[13:47:27] <Sadale> zoidberg, hmm. makes sense
[13:47:38] <Sadale> zoidberg, anyway I believe that the cheapest solution is probably pay for the cash upfront :P
[13:48:17] <zoidberg> nah Sadale, home loans are cheap, you can play around and invest the money in stocks
[13:48:56] <zoidberg> home loans interests are around 6% while you get at least 7-11% returns in stocks if played carefully
[13:49:22] <zoidberg> in America it's even lower, around 3-4%
[13:49:24] <Sadale> zoidberg, pfffffffffft

[13:52:18] <Sadale> I think it's closer to the 7% side. And there's a risk with the stock market so I probably won't put all of my money into it when I retire
[13:52:22] <zoidberg> Sadale: really? what's normal?
[13:52:43] <Sadale> zoidberg, probably somewhere close to 7%. Plus market fluctuation.
[13:53:13] <Sadale> Plus transaction fee.
[13:53:20] <Sadale> plus taxes, if any

[13:54:19] <zoidberg> there are some life long services that is like one time payment and afterwards no transanction fees
[13:54:25] <Sadale> What's known for sure is that they take management fee.
[13:54:34] <MootPoot> amigojapan: are videos like that supposed to be marked nsfw
[13:54:39] <Sadale> zoidberg, oh true. Some broker offers zero transaction fee.
[13:54:46] <MootPoot> becuase it has some fish blood/guts in it
[13:54:48] <amigojapan> Let me see MootPoot 
[13:55:06] <zoidberg> probably Sadale, I also don't know much. I never have enough money for stocks.

[13:55:33] * MootPoot casts a spell on sadale to turn him into a fish
[13:55:42] <Sadale> zoidberg, I've just checked. I'm actually able to afford some apartments in Cebu (where Miyu's living in) with my current savings. Paid in cash upfront.

[14:01:06] <zoidberg> Sadale: that's true but dfch says it's not that bad, he seems fine
[14:01:08] <Sadale> zoidberg, you'll know if you've lived inside mainland. Those firewall bypassing technique sometimes works. Sometimes it doesn't work.
[14:01:28] <Sadale> zoidberg, after I retire I'll be essentially living in the internet. Why do you even think that this kind of internet would be ok to me?
[14:01:32] <zoidberg> the great firewall of china
[14:01:56] <zoidberg> Sadale: I hope things change by the time you retire
[14:02:21] <amigojapan> zoidberg: it has just progressively gotten worse
[14:02:29] <Sadale> zoidberg, after I retire I'll be essentially living in the internet. Why do you even think that this kind of internet would be ok to me. And I'm not a political person. But as an internet user, I very much hope to be able to access the internet all over the world.

[14:03:13] <Sadale> zoidberg, and I think another biggest reason for the existance of the firewall is the economical benefit. It removes the competitions.
[14:03:14] *** Joins: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[14:03:40] <zoidberg> Sadale: the censorship mainly centered around the polotical stuff, isn't it? like tiamen square, winnie the pooh
[14:04:00] <Sadale> zoidberg, It's good for the people inside if they only care about the Chinese internet communities. But I've been accessing western sites since like forever.
[14:04:19] <Sadale> zoidberg, not true. facebook twitter google etc are blocked
[14:04:26] <zoidberg> Sadale: ohh
[14:04:31] <Sadale> zoidberg, it's far more than political. I think economy is a bigger reason of censorship than politics.
[14:04:43] <amigojapan> zoidberg: you did not know?
[14:04:51] <Sadale> So the firewall actually brings quite a bit of benefit for China as whole.
[14:05:01] <Sadale> It drives the domestic market.
[14:05:30] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I know they block them when some shit happens but I thought it's temporary thing
[14:05:51] <Sadale> those bigger websites are like blocked permanently. even youtube's blocked.
[14:06:07] <zoidberg> Sadale: yeah, I heard about it. Now they have chinese versions, don't they?
[14:06:12] <Sadale> You could bypass it tho. But those bypassing technique would stop working at times.
[14:06:15] <amigojapan> Now zoidberg I can't send Gmail to tomako's friend in China
[14:06:42] <Sadale> zoidberg, yep. But hey come on why do you think I'd be happy with only accessing Chinese content? I'm pretty much westernized online except for political view.
[14:07:07] <zoidberg> Sadale: you browse everything in English?
[14:07:15] <Sadale> zoidberg, yep. I thought that you know about that.
[14:07:24] <Sadale> zoidberg, Not everything. But almost everything. Like 95% of things.
[14:07:34] <zoidberg> Kind of but not sure about it
[14:08:13] <zoidberg> Sadale: there are some radicals who say that we should also do that shit
[14:08:25] <Sadale> zoidberg, internet curation?
[14:09:04] <zoidberg> yeah, blocking everything that allows any content these assholes don't like to read
[14:09:27] <zoidberg> people have become so sensitive these days, they don't even have balls
[14:09:47] <Sadale> kik'
[14:09:49] <Sadale> lol *
[14:10:02] <amigojapan> zoidberg: what is worse. Blocking the internet like the Chinese or not blocking it and arresting people and putting them in jail for years like they do in Japan?
[14:10:38] <zoidberg> that's like trolley problem amigojapan, I can't decide
[14:10:44] <Sadale> zoidberg, I'd blame those social medias for that. They're spreading hateful speech. It makes people becoming radical. :/
[14:10:55] <Sadale> Could be countries like Russia driving the divide between people :/
[14:11:01] <Sadale> spreading misinformation and shit
[14:11:31] <amigojapan> zoidberg: in Japan they recently arrested some people just for making movie reviews that were ok with fair use law

[14:12:56] <Sadale> Bco1981, hawt :3

[14:13:14] <Sadale> zoidberg, easier said than done
[14:13:30] <zoidberg> and also not every tom, dick and harry wouldn't join every social media
[14:13:41] <Sadale> people are idiots. More people means more idiots. Those major social media has a lot of people. So there're a lot of idiots inside. :P
[14:13:50] <Sadale> On the flip side, IRC has a lot less users. So there're less idiots :P
[14:13:56] <Sadale> IRC FTW :3
[14:14:51] <zoidberg> It's not just less number of people but the kind of people who use IRC are at least the sort than understand standard logic

[14:27:38] <MootPoot> yes
[14:27:44] <amigojapan> zoidberg: tomako does not understand what xx means either
[14:27:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, ah. not bad. Still that wouldn't generate 2x savings to me
[14:28:05] <MootPoot> then if you wanted to live alone your min cost would be about 2000 on rent and food etc
[14:28:08] <zoidberg> amigojapan: what does shinsai mean?
[14:28:17] <MootPoot> do about 2800 or so savings
[14:28:22] <zoidberg> amigojapan: maybe it's like x in hunter x hunter

[14:30:09] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope
[14:30:17] <Sadale> MootPoot, here it's common to pay for provision.
[14:30:26] <zoidberg> why do you have to pay for your parents provision?

[15:42:25] <DPA> Yes. But desktop devs tend to see the choice as confusing for the users, desktop users tend to ask for "one consistent linux", and big players such as gnome, canonical, etc. tend to do it's own thing & reinvent things, while disregarding the fallout they cause for alternatives.

[15:46:51] <DPA> An obviouse example of the first thing I mentioned would be gnome CSD. Because of it, other WMs can't show their own borders anymore, which the user used to choose. You can add them on top of the CSD border, but it's just not the same. THere are many similar cases.
[15:46:53] <Bco1981> i didn't game much, the others did, Dota2 and COD Vangard, and i setup a dedicated server for Satisfactory
[15:47:03] <MootPoot> DPA the 'QA' Control that linux devs has is pretty bad as it is 
[15:47:07] <Bco1981> i played some minecraft, and diablo 1, not the remake
[15:47:09] <MootPoot> from what I've seen
[15:47:29] <MootPoot> unless you're talking about like enterprise stuff
[15:47:33] <DPA> MootPoot: Not the QA of the devs. THe QA of the distro maintainers.
[15:47:42] <MootPoot> ah
[15:47:54] <MootPoot> yeah I dont know abbout that
[15:48:16] <Terminus> linux works for every use case i have except games and i blame my desire to not dick around with proton.
[15:49:05] <MootPoot> Then it sounds like its the best OS for you
[15:49:08] <Terminus> i even run a flight planning program for MSFS on my linux laptop because it has native linux binaries.
[15:49:14] <amigojapan> Terminus: in my case even the one game I play on Windows it seems now supports Linux

[19:20:39] <MootPoot> I just but anyway
[19:20:56] <MootPoot> I ended up using an old tablet I found as that kind of billboard/clock thing
[19:21:00] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha Hen | Episode: 6
[19:21:04] <MootPoot> so now I'm just wondering if there is any point
[19:21:13] <MootPoot> to doing the large display thing
[19:21:37] <MootPoot> its not like I was using it for anything else
[19:21:56] <MootPoot> now that the functionality has been replaced
[19:22:01] <MootPoot> the only thing it'll be good for is like
[19:22:02] <zoidberg> why not spend it on projector?
[19:22:11] <MootPoot> tv show watching
[19:22:11] <Bco1981> as long as it can run it without it looking like it's lagging/struggeling to run it.
[19:22:16] <MootPoot> zoidberg: I already have a projector
[19:22:28] <MootPoot> but I dont have the room to set it up
[19:22:44] <zoidberg> ah, ok. You can watch anime, movies and what not if it's your thing
[19:22:44] <Bco1981> my old tablet with youtube is like using the rpi for youtube... don't
[19:22:59] <MootPoot> yeah
[19:23:11] <MootPoot> its not stonk enough for fancy animations and whatever
[19:23:14] <zoidberg> Bco1981: is there any prebuilt rpi tab?
[19:23:18] <MootPoot> which would be the only thing it could do now
[19:23:27] * Sadale has only upgraded to 1080p like a year ago
[19:23:34] <Bco1981> zoidberg: i don't think so, there is a kit maybe
[19:23:37] <Sadale> My old laptop was 1366x768 :/
[19:23:37] <zoidberg> me too Sadale 
[19:23:41] <MootPoot> now that the teblet is basically doing the whole "smart clock/calender/cool pictures" thing
[19:23:46] <Sadale> And now MootPoot's looking at 4K.
[19:23:49] <zoidberg> Sadale: same!!
[19:23:54] <Sadale> lavish MootPoot :P
[19:24:09] <MootPoot> Sadale: hurry up and join the triple 4k squad
[19:24:15] <Sadale> NOPE
[19:24:20] <MootPoot> with 144hz and HDR as well
[19:24:23] <Sadale> no money
[19:24:29] <zoidberg> but doesn't it need like same quality of movies to appreciate the 4k?
[19:24:33] <Sadale> plus I don't think my iGPU could handle 4K well.
[19:24:36] <MootPoot> I've been running 3x 4k monitors for a while 
[19:24:38] <Sadale> plus the software for 4K isn't quite ready
[19:24:40] <MootPoot> pretty nice
[19:24:51] <Jigsy> 4K eats most of my cores.
[19:24:55] <Sadale> If I use 4K some of the old applications would look tiny af
[19:24:57] <MootPoot> 4 kores
[19:25:05] <MootPoot> Sadale: that sounds like a OS scaling problem
[19:25:10] <zoidberg> Sadale: I would rather buy steam engine
[19:25:10] <MootPoot> everything should scale and look fine
[19:25:23] <Sadale> zoidberg, lolwut why steam engine
[19:25:35] <zoidberg> to play games of course
[19:25:51] <Bco1981> MootPoot: new/present apps yes they scale fine. try loading a app from 2000.
[19:25:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, Not sure if that holds true for old apps. Anyway I don't think my iGPU can handle 4K well. Even if it does, 4K means GPU performance drop to me. 
[19:26:02] <zoidberg> Sadale: I mean steam machine*
[19:26:17] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  Companibility mode takes care of that
[19:26:19] <Sadale> And I find the benefit of using 4K questionable considered that my screen is 15.6".
[19:26:22] <MootPoot> and /or mods 
[19:26:29] <MootPoot> but I rarely run old apps anyway
[19:26:35] <Sadale> For largest screens tho 4K may pay off
[19:26:35] <MootPoot> so I guess its not a concern for me 
[19:26:40] <SummerSkies> Roman Reigns vs Big E tonight
[19:26:48] <MootPoot> Sadale: yeah , I have it at 27"
[19:27:17] <MootPoot> but your performance dosen't really drop - its always the same
[19:27:20] <MootPoot> igpus are just slow 
[19:27:22] <MootPoot> :P
[19:28:25] <zoidberg> Sadale: I screwed up buying laptop. The display is IPS like display which isn't IPS.
[19:28:59] <Sadale> zoidberg, what makes the IPS ones so special? :o
[19:29:09] <Bco1981> better color
[19:29:16] <Sadale> MootPoot, I know you rich. Mine's almost the best iGPU you could find in the market as of today. 2400G.
[19:29:27] <zoidberg> I don't know Sadale, they are better to look at
[19:29:34] <MootPoot> isen't the best like the current alder lake ones?
[19:29:38] <MootPoot> or the 5700g
[19:29:42] <Sadale> Ryzen 3 2400G. The iGPU is about as good as 5700G. But the CPU is far weaker
[19:29:51] <MootPoot> oh
[19:29:57] <MootPoot> then you should have no issue at 4k 
[19:30:02] <MootPoot> unless you're gaming
[19:30:06] <Bco1981> Gamers Nexus did a test of the alderlake 770UHD
[19:30:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, exactly. With 1080p I could easily game with no stutter. At 4K I'd be expecting lag and shit. So why bother? :S
[19:30:45] <MootPoot> .....
[19:30:45] <Bco1981> it's sometimes on par with amd igpu, but half the time it's not and it's like half or less.
[19:30:50] * MootPoot spanks Sadale

[19:30:54] <MootPoot> BAKA
[19:31:11] * Sadale moans :3
[19:31:26] <MootPoot> Sadale:  you use the 4k when browsing, video watching, etc
[19:31:33] <MootPoot> and then you just upscale from 1080 when gaming
[19:31:35] <Sadale> 15.6" screen :P
[19:31:45] <Sadale> no need for 4K :P
[19:31:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: if you got a 4k screen it wouldn't be 15" lol
[19:31:54] <zoidberg> seems like everyone uses ryzen here
[19:31:59] <Bco1981> no, upscale from 540 to 1080
[19:32:04] <MootPoot> zoidberg: I have all 3

[21:49:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KatrinValerie: Rust may or may not be a better C++. Go is kinda crappy except its CSP stuff. To note is that Java was originally only developed by an evil corp (Oracle) and used to only have its implementation as primary used. That's... very much no longer the case. No one does business with Oracle if they can avoid it.
[21:53:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > the problem is social media being free Sadale. If they charge people and do stuff properly, today would have been lot different | It'd arguably be worse, you'd have even more walled gardens.
[21:53:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They already don't need to sell data, they do it because it's profitable.
[21:53:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Take a look at smart TVs.
[21:53:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They make vastly more profit out of its ad capacity than out of the initial sale.
[21:58:38] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose do you think fediverse stuff will ever matter or displace corporate social media models

[22:21:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And while I don't care much for the former, unlike the latter for whom I have much empathy, having the former trapped still serves to increase corporate power.

[23:16:36] <isekaijin> Bco1981: I am not talking about the abstract capabilities of a computer (yes, it “performs arithmetic operations according to programmer-supplied instructions”), but rather the sheer amount of knowledge one has to have to get a computer to do what you want it to do.
[23:17:08] <Bco1981> yes, that's correct
[23:18:24] <isekaijin> Programming was much easier when everything was sequential. Also when you could do interesting things without requesting other people's computers to do things for you.
