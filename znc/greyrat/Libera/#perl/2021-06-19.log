[07:48:25] <simcop2387> o_O i don't remember that being in there
[07:48:35] <simcop2387> very old easter egg then
[07:48:54] <simcop2387> rindolf: it's got data from 2009 to today
[07:49:09] <Adura> sweval: "\x01CTCP VERSION\x01"
[07:49:11] <perlbot> Adura: CTCP VERSION
[07:49:25] <Adura> Wait, what, that's not it...
[07:49:42] <perlbot> no responses that i see
[07:49:44] <Adura> sweval: "\x01VERSION\x01"
[07:49:46] <perlbot> Adura: VERSION
[07:49:49] <Adura> There we go!
[07:50:11] <perlbot> uh... wow
[07:50:18] *** Quits: wilk (~wilk@user/wilk) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[07:50:18] *** wilk_ is now known as wilk
[07:50:47] <simcop2387> Adura++ that worked on 20 people
[07:51:01] <Adura> sweval: "\x01DCC CHAT\x01"
[07:51:02] <perlbot> Adura: DCC CHAT
[07:51:29] <Adura> I do not recall if that's the right line.
[07:51:53] <perlbot> perlbot pasted a new file at https://perl.bot/p/okg7oc - So many people
[07:52:12] <simcop2387> not sure on that one either but the bouncer will block dcc stuff anyway
[07:52:22] <simcop2387> Adura: your handywork, see that paste
[07:52:39] <Adura> That I did.
[07:52:40] <simcop2387> Grinnz: fix your bots :p
[07:52:58] <Grinnz> ?
[07:53:15] <Adura> It's more of a "Fix their clients.".
[07:53:18] <simcop2387> Grinnz: they respond to CTCP VERSION anywhere in a private message
[07:53:27] <simcop2387> it's likely a Mojo::IRC bug
[07:53:48] <simcop2387> Grinnz: see the paste from perlbot just above there
[07:54:02] <simcop2387> that'd also explain convos (I think it's mojo based isn't it)
[07:54:13] <Grinnz> i don't see what the bug is
[07:54:50] <simcop2387> Grinnz: perlbot send \x01CTCP VERSION\x01 in a PRIVMSG, and not at the beginning of the line.  Mojo::IRC interpreted it as if it was a proper CTCP
[07:55:08] <Adura> Actually, sans CTCP
[07:55:14] <Adura> That was my mistake.
[07:55:18] <simcop2387> ah right
[07:55:25] <rindolf> simcop2387: ah, i see - cool
[07:55:31] <Adura> Just \x01COMMAND\x01
[07:57:29] <Grinnz> i mean, it's just Parse::IRC
[07:57:50] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Quit: Unfortunately time is always against us -- [Morpheus])
[07:58:08] <Grinnz> https://metacpan.org/dist/Parse-IRC/source/lib/Parse/IRC.pm#L123 looks like it's a little too accepting
[07:58:09] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ lib/Parse/IRC.pm - metacpan.org ]
[07:59:47] <simcop2387> that'd be why leonerd's stuff doesn't do it.  it uses Protocol::IRC
[08:02:11] <Grinnz> and POE::Component::IRC and quassel and revolution and thunderbird
[08:02:25] <Grinnz> and one client that recognized it as a CTCP but got confused about the command
[08:02:35] <simcop2387> yea i'm curious what that one is
[08:02:42] <simcop2387> Adura++ friday night fun on irc
[08:03:02] <Adura> I'd have looped the bots here if I tried harder, heh.
[08:03:04] <Grinnz> honestly i don't even know if i'd call it a bug, though it could probably make sure the \x01 is actually at the beginning
[08:03:17] <Grinnz> IRC is defined by implementation lol
[08:05:53] <Grinnz> i would assume the clients that didn't recognize the command actually said "unrecognized command \x01VERSION"
[08:07:11] <Grinnz> also, a ctcp notice? lol

[20:12:04] <aquanight> if, after sudo sh you still do not see PERL_UNICODE
[20:12:34] <aquanight> that still runs shell-init files (but it runs root's shell init)
[20:12:37] <mst> 'sudo su - myuser bash -l' is a way to get a clean login shell

[20:13:16] <mst> also then you can add strace to log all system calls
[20:13:17] <aquanight> mst's idea is good too
[20:13:30] <aquanight> you can also sudo -u yourself sh -l
[20:13:34] <mst> (I'm flailing a bit here, because yeah, this is weird)

[20:13:52] <mst> yeah, my 'sudo su -' habit is Olde finger macros
[20:13:58] <aquanight> my theory still is, if you really cannot find it in any of your shell init files, maybe it is being pushed via ssh?
[20:14:09] <scp1> no, it's my local dev box

[20:42:12] <scp1> thanks a ton for your help guys 
[20:44:11] <aquanight> my best guess is that it somehow got set in your session script
[20:44:36] <aquanight> so it was getting inherited by everything
[20:45:06] <aquanight> but that's still baffling as hell because grepping through /proc/X/environ should've been able to find the culprit
[20:46:03] <leitz> mst, it makes reports like:   https://gist.github.com/LeamHall/9be590286ea8258995721358c3d36061

[20:47:06] <mst> aquanight: I have that many running as well as having screen/tmux/abduco server side
[20:47:12] <aquanight> reading up on ratpoison they say they were inspired by such things, but really all it reads like is they use a keyboard-driven window switcher
[20:47:32] <mst> leitz: maybe Book::Collate::Stats ?
[20:47:38] <aquanight> I want to see an X DE/WM that supports detaching
[20:47:44] <aquanight> kinda like VNC I guess
[20:47:45] *** Joins: chrysanthematic (~chrysanth@user/chrysanthematic)
[20:48:03] <aquanight> but I think I would want to do it more like acting like an X server proxy
[20:48:09] <mst> aquanight: for that I'd run xvnc plus a vnc client tbh
[20:48:47] <aquanight> well the thing is at least while attached you would still want to have the option of having GFX HW access
[20:48:48] <mst> scp1: note, btw, if it's relevant to you, 'abduco' is currently my single favourite single-purpose attach/detach program
[20:48:52] <aquanight> e.g. via gl and shit

[20:51:57] <mst> scp1: but I like having the detacher separate from everything else
[20:52:06] <mst> scp1: which meant I used to use dtach, and have now switched to abduco
[20:52:46] <scp1> mst, I've been having an ongoing beef with the tmux author for 10+ years so screen have been fine with me. I see that the abduco author is the same as the dvtm author though - dvtm is pretty much ratpoison for console :D
[20:53:04] <thrig> screen shows up in the CVE listings too much for my taste
[20:53:14] <mst> scp1: yes, the whole point is that dvtm provides the 'multi session management' and abduco provides the 'detaching' part
[20:53:23] <scp1> indeed
[20:53:41] <mst> I'm only using abduco because I manage my terminals by tiling

[23:46:21] <nirnam> where does unlink get it name?
[23:47:11] <mst> nirnam: because a file can have more than one link to it
[23:47:34] <mst> nirnam: 'ln' creates an additional link to the same file

[23:48:01] <mst> nirnam: so e.g. /home/matthewt/foo and /home/matthewt/bar/baz can both be links to the same file, under the unix model
[23:48:09] <mst> nirnam: unlink removes a name that's a link to a file
[23:48:34] <mst> nirnam: if it's the last link, the file lasts only until any remaining processes with filehandles open to it close them or exit, and then is deleted
[23:49:49] <nirnam> I see, that make really sense, however I feel this itch to ask because I found os.remove by python or FILE.delete of ruby quite straight forward name
[23:50:12] <huf> well, it turned out that hardlinking isnt used all that much
[23:50:15] <nirnam> the itch is gone now that I knows the reason why
[23:50:20] <huf> so uuuusually, an unlink is a delete
[23:50:25] <huf> baaasically :D
[23:50:32] <mst> nirnam: right, perl calls it unlink() because that's the name of the underlying unix system call
[23:51:04] <mst> nirnam: e.g. Path::Tiny or Mojo::File which I use one of most of the time for such things use more 'normal' names
[23:52:13] <mst> but yeah, -most- of the time there's only one link to a specific file so unlink() is effectively remove/delete
[23:53:06] <nirnam> would you consider aliasing it to more normal name?
[23:53:55] <mst> nirnam: the perl builtins all match the unix system calls
[23:54:09] <mst> use Path::Tiny;
[23:54:15] <mst> path($file)->remove;
[23:54:23] <mst> already exists if you want a more normal name
[23:54:24] <huf> they match but the structs turn into arrays
[23:54:32] <huf> which is ... why not hashes? ugh.
[23:54:44] <huf> yes yes I know, there's that module that fixes this
[23:55:48] <nirnam> mst: and I have never used unlink before, to me when I found about perl unlink it just doens't click right away
[23:55:48] <mst> huf: what
[23:56:11] <huf> mst: localtime
[23:56:16] <mst> huf: oh, yes, Time::gmtime and File::stat and etc.
[23:56:20] <huf> yeh
