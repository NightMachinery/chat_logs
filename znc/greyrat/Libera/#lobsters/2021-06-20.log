[00:09:36] <imode> chicken and rice in some nice sauce, tho? you bet your ass I'll make it.

[00:14:57] <badtuple> The internet never stopped, depending on the parts you go to
[00:15:35] <manicennui> I can't stop thinking about the third line of this comic: https://i.redd.it/6dwvz6npve571.jpg
[00:15:36] <badtuple> seriously though, Portland has people out and about again and it's nice to see the life.
[00:15:36] <pretty_dumm_guy> hand licking just momentarily reminded me of a past where I used to eat food with hand. I miss it tbh. Spoon and forks are good. But meh

[07:20:10] <companion_cube> Write an OS in postscript or something? :p
[07:22:43] <imode> been trying to find literature on machine models that are equivalent in "concept" to process calculi.
[07:24:00] <companion_cube> You mean actual machines?
[07:24:33] <imode> nah theoretical machine models.
[07:26:53] <companion_cube> I mean there might be some process based languages (Pict? Definitely E) and maybe VMs
[07:27:09] <imode> turing machine equivalent to the pi calculus is how I can best describe what I'm curious about.
[07:27:56] <imode> the problem is that because they're both equivalent in expressive power, I get details on _that_, but not in models designed in a similar fashion to model things like complexity.
[07:28:20] <imode> we can form, say, reduction-based models but they don't tell us a lot about the complexity of a particular algorithm when modeled in that model of concurrency.
[07:28:23] <companion_cube> E is definitely cool
[07:28:37] <companion_cube> Ah, complexity
[07:28:39] <imode> they tell us a lot about the _structure_, I guess, but not the actual complexity.
[07:28:47] <companion_cube> Does CSP work for you?
[07:29:01] <companion_cube> Not sure if it can model complexity
[07:29:04] <imode> any process calculi, I feel, lacks the descriptive power.
[07:29:35] <imode> which is sad. I almost wanna make a concurrent P'', where the cell structure isn't symbol-based, but process based. somehow.
[07:29:58] <imode> that might say something about structured concurrency.
[07:30:01] *** Joins: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)
[07:31:03] <companion_cube> I wonder
[07:31:11] <companion_cube> Does complexity depend on the interleaving?
[07:31:24] <imode> interleaving? you mean some kind of scheduling?
[07:31:25] <companion_cube> You need a notion of fairness probably
[07:31:39] <imode> yeah, that's the interesting bit.
[07:31:45] <companion_cube> Well if you have concurrency you have interleaving
[07:31:58] <imode> you could probably parameterize that.
[07:32:02] <companion_cube> You can't count instructions if it depends on the concrete trace
[07:32:22] <companion_cube> Maybe at best have symbolic lower and upper bounds
[07:33:08] <imode> yeah, worst case vs. best case, and I guess the best case would be total parallelism.
[07:33:16] <imode> for some contexts.
[07:33:28] <imode> I'm mostly interested in deriving some concrete implementation from that theoretical model.
[07:35:00] <companion_cube> It's more that there are interleavings where threads don't block too much, and some in which they starve each other, I think
[07:35:10] <companion_cube> There can even be deadlocks
[07:35:51] * imode wonders how you'd model a deadlock in the pi calculus.
[07:36:10] <imode> probably just two concurrent processes reading from two different channels.
[07:36:21] <imode> iirc that's blocking.

[07:36:44] <companion_cube> Non determinism seems hard to combine with complexity anyway
[07:36:50] <companion_cube> I'm rambling 😂
[07:37:09] <imode> rambling is good. rubber ducking has some of the best ideas arise from it.
[07:38:14] <imode> the pi calculus is interesting, though. it doesn't allow for so-called mobile code because you can't send processes along channels.
[07:38:32] <companion_cube> Tbh I know little about complexity models, beyond some stuff related to data structures (Okasaki)
[07:38:45] <imode> it's kind of interesting when you start to study slowdowns.
[07:38:48] <companion_cube> It allows to send channels over channels though
[07:38:58] <imode> yeah, and those are members of an arbitrary symbol set.

[07:39:14] <imode> yeah, very familiar with maude.
[07:39:30] <imode> reduction counting doesn't really get to the heart of it because multiple steps can happen in a single reduction.
[07:39:32] <imode> multiple sends, etc.
[07:39:41] <imode> though I guess that'd be the _point_.. I'd rather analyze a machine model.
[07:40:01] <companion_cube> TLA? :p
[07:40:16] <imode> that's actually a little interesting. what would a turing machine that could spawn other concurrently executing turing machines look like.
[07:40:20] <companion_cube> Although it's more a modeling language.
[07:40:30] <companion_cube> How do they communicate?
[07:40:42] <imode> good question. really only two answers there, symbol exchange or a shared tape.
[07:40:47] <companion_cube> Io uring ?
[07:40:49] <imode> hahahaha.
[07:40:52] <companion_cube> :D
[07:41:10] <imode> shared tape leads to disgusting mutability problems.
[07:41:11] <companion_cube> Well what if there were queues maybe
[07:41:22] <companion_cube> Read from queue and put symbol on tape
[07:41:39] <imode> that makes sense. how would you specify which machine to communicate with.
[07:41:44] <companion_cube> Could be blocking or not
[07:41:46] <companion_cube> Ah
[07:41:52] <imode> that's kind of the kicker.
[07:41:58] <companion_cube> Maybe when you start the machine you give it the queue
[07:42:03] <companion_cube> A callback, in a way
[07:42:11] <imode> then you can only create a finite amount of processes, and they need to be known ahead of time.
[07:42:14] <companion_cube> Or queues could be symbols themselves
[07:42:36] <imode> I experimented with the idea that the processes were the symbols and could be manipulated/passed around. kind of like erlang's process IDs.
[07:43:05] <imode> but it was really weird. the only thing you could really do is compare two processes to see if they're equal.
[07:43:21] *** Quits: kanwar (~kanwar@45.251.106.233) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[07:43:30] <imode> and the definition of equality was really sparse. are two processes equal if their source is equal? are they equal if their instances are equal?
[07:43:46] <companion_cube> Bisimulation? :)
[07:43:56] <imode> if the former, then you could formulate the "null process" and the "unit process" and just do everything in binary.
[07:44:11] <companion_cube> Maybe a shared tape is not that bad
[07:44:23] <companion_cube> With atomic operations and 'await'?
[07:44:33] <companion_cube> Await condition I mean

[07:46:17] * imode ponders.
[07:46:27] <companion_cube> Well
[07:46:50] <imode> a lot of literature just goes "we already have a machine model, just bolt on concurrency primitives".
[07:46:51] <companion_cube> Beam has a bit of all that? Even complexity, as measured by reduction counters
[07:47:04] <companion_cube> Like the bytecode has all you want :)
[07:47:08] <imode> right. BEAM's awesome.
[07:47:09] <companion_cube> It's just not TM based
[07:47:26] <companion_cube> But there's individual  instructions to send a message iirc
[07:47:47] <imode> the inner completionist in me is pissed that we talk about models of concurrency but we don't have theoretical machine models to back that up.
[07:48:16] <imode> so we have the ability to say "process X sends a message across channel Y" but we don't have the ability to say "and the cost for this is X"
[07:48:29] *** Joins: loc (~loc@174-045-102-241.res.spectrum.com)
[07:48:33] <imode> you could augment it, but again, the reduction system means you need to examine it across all methods of reduction.
[07:48:40] <companion_cube> Well, often it doesn't have a concrete cost
[07:48:42] <companion_cube> You don't know
[07:48:53] <imode> that's true. but you can start fiddling with the parameters.
[07:48:56] <companion_cube> Could be a process in the same node, or on the other side of the earth
[07:49:03] <companion_cube> And I think that's kind of the point :)
[07:49:21] <imode> right. but it'd be neat to say "in these sets of scenarios, it behaves like X".
[07:51:17] <imode> I think the main problem I have with the "symbols as processes" stuff is that you still need some fundamental "data" symbols to send each process to.. I dunno, do stuff.
[07:51:18] <companion_cube> Planning for the best case? :)
[07:51:30] <companion_cube> Yes, erlang terms :)
[07:51:38] <companion_cube> I just love FP, sorry
[07:51:41] <imode> right, but in TM terms, that'd be just bits.
[07:51:50] <companion_cube> (and erlang serialization is so well done)
[07:52:05] <companion_cube> Sure, they all have a clear serialization format
[07:52:15] <companion_cube> Since it's often done...
[07:52:21] <imode> so 1's, 0's, and a giant theoretically unbunded symbol set for spawning processes with special marker edges in the state graph.

[16:45:11] <skrzyp> Currently I'm trying to do some little utility which interacts with my radio receiver over serial port (the documentation is available and rather nice) to log the scanner hits and maybe possibly record and cut out audio files in the future. Everything in nice TUI environment. So far so good, I've chosen Golang at first as I'm using it at work and had some experience in it...
[16:46:55] <skrzyp> ...and it also has some nice TUI libs - tview and clui (I used tview in the past and it was okayish). But, to my own surprise, I didn't consider the serial port part, thinking it should work pretty much instant on such respected environment as Golang is with its many libraries. And now I'm pretty much shocked looking how buggy every golang serial I/O lib is (and there are not many of them
[16:46:58] <skrzyp> though).
[16:47:36] <pe> My first thought is: why are you looking for libraries?
[16:47:44] <skrzyp> Requesting status line over serial (which is about 64-128 bytes long) works pretty nice in picocom, minicom and even Python's serial lib, the only nitpick is that communication uses crlf as line ends.
[16:48:05] <pe> /dev/ttyXXX and a few ioctls.
[16:48:07] <riv> oh damn , what a shame
[16:48:34] <skrzyp> But in Golang - oh well, it somehow cuts out up to dozen last bytes from each line randomly, even when I specify stupidly large buffers for it.

[21:46:05] <imode> well that's hella neat. space filling curves are neat.
[21:47:01] <forestj>  Im not aware of any other projects that do this directly (provide a translation layer between an existing 1d index and a new 2d spatial index)

[21:48:02] <imode> you'll more than likely find that in multicore processor papers. mapping process topologies to 1D on-chip rings.
[21:48:43] <drobilla> The general idea has been around for a long time and gets used here and there, but spatial indices in general seem to be stuck in this esoteric niche

[21:49:31] <drobilla> The number of times I've encountered really horrific "solutions" to obvious multi-dimensional indexing problems by janking together standard library containers or whatever is... a lot more than zero anyway
[21:49:37] <imode> in order to map a portion of your processor array to a space, you'd need to essentially map a 2D index into a 1D index.
[21:49:53] <imode> or a tree, for example.
[21:50:07] <forestj> Yeah, makes sense.

[21:52:50] *** Quits: fedorafan (~fedorafan@user/fedorafan) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:56:42] <imode> something that's been rolling around in my head is.. what if we replace, say, erlang's process model with something like a "process ring". you can only send data to the left or right of you, and you can spawn processes to the left and right of you to "extend" the ring. you'd need to build complex data structures up by mapping portions of the ring to said datastructures.
[21:56:42] *** Joins: fedorafan (~fedorafan@user/fedorafan)
[21:58:29] <Ori_B> what does that buy you?
[21:59:03] <imode> not much other than simplicity, and maybe a semi-direct mapping of your program's execution patterns to processors that have on-chip ring networks.
[21:59:47] <drobilla> Sounds ~= to classic distributed computing architectures (MPI land and such)?  Except the spawning bit
[22:00:11] <drobilla> But in keeping with the theme, clearly we want a process hypercube
[22:00:24] <imode> clearly. with locality defined as the hamming distance.
[22:00:28] <drobilla> I mean, it's got hyper in the name
[22:00:33] <drobilla> Can't not be awesomer
[22:01:08] <imode> there's actually an interesting reason to prefer rings vs. hypercubes: I can't extend/tile a hypercube network.
[22:02:13] <drobilla> Depends on the problem at hand, I think.  Sort of inherently not a generic model
[22:02:49] <drobilla> You can extend torii in a similarish way I suppose
[22:03:07] <drobilla> .... kinda.  Needs way more coordination
[22:03:29] <imode> yeah. I can just slice a ring network at two points and do anything with the segment. map it to another part of the ring, etc.
[22:03:47] <imode> torii get more complex especially when you start defining "wormholes" at certain segments.
