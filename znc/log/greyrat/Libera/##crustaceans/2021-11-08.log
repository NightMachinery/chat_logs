[00:51:53] <buttsbot> Twitter - awilkinson - I read a book that blew my mind a little and I can’t stop telling people about it.  It explains why so many people dedicate ...
[00:53:07] <dimadima> gerikson: smh
[00:53:39] <dimadima> At face value, it barely sounds worth mentioning:
[00:53:56] <dimadima> read through half of it; not much worth mentioning; basic hive mind at work
[00:54:20] <dimadima> people influence other people; we're susceptible to that sort of thing. roger
[00:54:52] <dimadima> the dianetic joke in the beginning was good thoguh
[00:55:04] <dimadima> If you enjoyed this thread, you should follow me: @awilkinson
[00:56:11] <imode> I did not, therefore I will not.

[20:46:01] <indigo> Sounds like someone had a bunch of pirated content
[20:46:15] <kline> edk, i dont generally read that domain when i see it unless its directly relevant to my interests
[20:46:24] <edk> i didn't read the article
[20:46:30] <edk> it was the comments that felt HN-y
[20:47:02] <kline> given its about the illicit side of the industry i suspect its going to be mostly non-technical, but im reading it now
[20:47:10] <imode> indigo: hahahaha.
[20:47:25] <imode> good ol' dvdrips.
[20:48:32] <indigo> Also... ZFS on Alpine Linux, running non-ECC RAM
[20:48:43] * indigo salutes
[20:50:23] <kline> edk, its just "ariadne talks about some really boring implementation details of stuff that no one here will ever touch; i conclude by stating that ad industry is peak capitalism"
[20:50:48] <kline> so yes, its basically a HN post with just enough decoy js to make it look like its technically interesting (its not)
[20:51:52] <kline> the adtech/webshit/capitalism cocktail gets a zesty crypto twist at the end, just in case anyone was swithering about if to post it or not
[20:52:11] <edk> there's no point in downvoting this
[20:52:47] <imode> I should build a FreeBSD/FreeNAS box..
[20:52:58] <kline> the real takeaway is that ariadne is adopting the same iterative process of engagementbait for hn/lobsters/etc
[20:53:08] <kline> (as the ad industry in which they worked)
[20:53:26] <imode> ariadne worked in the ad industry? TIL.
[20:53:45] <kline> ariadne has apparently worked in every industry, as a short term contractor
[20:53:55] <edk> it's disappointing that it's relevant to anything where ariadne worked
[20:54:07] <edk> this is a bad thread

[20:55:44] <edk> apparently someone else did too
[20:55:47] <imode> hahahahahahaha.
[20:55:48] <kline> go on
[20:56:05] <edk> it's back to Normalizing a database schema
[20:56:16] <kline> i guess the site needs an additional check to disable useredits after being reviewed by a mod
[20:56:49] <imode> or keep it. anarchyyy.
[20:57:35] <kline> anarchy sucks
[20:57:42] <imode> you suck.
[20:57:45] <imode> </anarchy>
[20:58:16] <imode> jokes aside push does a decent job of keeping lobste.rs sterile.
[20:58:24] <edk> yes
[20:59:06] <indigo> Apparently folks think the article isn't really about normalizing a database schema, but an allegory about junior engineers
[20:59:29] <edk> i mean, it is
[20:59:57] <edk> but annoying sock is a noble endeavour
[21:00:34] <kline> indigo, its true, its not about the database at all
[21:00:56] <kline> i dont see what that has to do with the title though
[21:01:18] <kline> neither of the titles were anything to do with the junior dev bit
[21:01:31] <edk> imode: it's just regrettable that i don't think many people are interested in thanking him for that effort
[21:02:04] <imode> tip your moderators.
[21:10:40] <kline> my x270 has decided to have a bad day and i hope it doesnt turn into more than that
[21:11:02] <kline> the touch pad has become extremely sensitive to the local electric field
[21:11:39] <kline> i can wiggle the cursor by moving my body or conductive objects around in the general vicinity, even with my hands well clear
[21:11:50] <indigo> So weird
[21:16:04] <kline> the way capacitive touchpads work is by measuring the RC constant by the virtual capacitor between the touchpad elements and your body
[21:16:57] <kline> theres probably some debris or damage on the analogue side close to where the touchpads sensor elements are wired up such that what/where is being measured is a bit loosey goosey
[21:17:52] <kline> instead of measuring the carefully designed sensor elements capacitance, its coupled to a metal structural element or another trace that is less carefully characterised
[21:18:07] <edk> that or the air in your room has accidentally become conductive
[21:21:04] <kline> maybe
[21:21:23] <kline> maybe the dielectric constants of the universe are changing ahead of an expanding bubble of vacuum collapse
[21:21:30] <indigo> Maybe you have some secret superpowers
[21:21:33] <kline> this would be a nice way to dodge various responsibilities of life
[21:22:50] <Brekkjern> Man. Sometimes nesting list comprehensions make for really nice code.
[21:32:21] <indigo> Brekkjern: I love nested list comprehensions for making 2D matrices in Python
[21:32:27] <indigo> Especially during interviews
[21:34:24] <indigo> How's life, btw? I finally tried out some legit dill mustard sauce + smoked salmon and found out that I totally made the sauce wrong last time :D
[21:37:32] <Brekkjern> indigo: This is what I'm talking about: https://gist.github.com/Brekkjern/48a7d4d36d68e1849f6e63dde17afd15

[21:37:35] <Brekkjern> Ish
[21:37:52] <Brekkjern> I had to rewrite the original since I had change it, so it is probably not quite correct
[21:38:55] <riv> nested list comprehensions -> list monad
[21:39:54] <indigo> Almost reminds me of LINQ in C#
[21:41:00] <Brekkjern> Believe it or not, but that change actually saved 10 seconds of execution time.
[21:41:13] <Brekkjern> Went from about 50 seconds to 40.
[21:41:51] <indigo> Interesting
[21:42:22] <ngoldbaum> yeah list comprehensions are a teeny bit more optimized
[21:42:25] <Brekkjern> That said, there are about 9 million relation objects though
[21:42:35] <ngoldbaum> too bad they make the logic flow right to left
[21:42:40] <ngoldbaum> i guess they work better in arabic
[21:42:47] <Brekkjern> Nah. The speedup is mostly because I swapped out sets for lists.
[21:42:57] <Brekkjern> So much time was spent hashing objects
[22:16:21] <kline> one of my staff was getting really mad at the radio today claiming it was shit music (it was to be fair) and stomped through to me demanding to know who keeps changing the station
[22:16:32] <kline> i think you can all guess how this story ends
[23:19:10] <Brekkjern> Considering how easy it is to use a profiler, it's amazing I haven't used one before...
[23:19:37] <Brekkjern> I normally don't write performance sensitive code, so it's never really been much of a point
[23:19:56] <Brekkjern> But for this homework it helped nail down the excessive use of datastructures requiring hashing
[23:21:05] <ngoldbaum> py-spy is v v nice
[23:21:13] <ngoldbaum> if you haven’t tried it
[23:21:18] <Brekkjern> I just used the built in one
[23:21:29] <Brekkjern> I didn't really need much more than a few numbers to see what the slowdown came from
[23:31:01] <cryptosporidium> profilers are awesome. they've only come in handy a few times for me but when they do, it's great fun
[23:31:37] <cryptosporidium> i've basically only used the chrome profiler for web stuff. really nice.
[23:32:13] <cryptosporidium> unrelated, it also lets you grab screenshots, so it's really useful for figuring out weird quick glitchiness
[23:42:17] <indigo> Flame graphs are my favorite
[23:42:33] <cryptosporidium> they're awesome
[23:43:02] <cryptosporidium> it's pretty cool there's more or less a standard format for flame graphs; i believe i've captured python or java traces and opened them up in chrome dev tools
[23:43:18] <imode> cryptosporidium: 137, report to furon HQ.
[23:43:18] <companion_cube> emitting the format of chrome://tracing is also very good
[23:43:28] <companion_cube> it's easy and you get a good viewer for them
[23:43:38] <companion_cube> (you just need json and a decent micro second clock)
[23:45:54] <Brekkjern> Flame graphs would be cool, yeah

[23:48:45] <imode> how did you not know that lol.
[23:53:08] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: https://github.com/benfred/py-spy
[23:53:08] <buttsbot> GitHub - benfred/py-spy: Sampling profiler for Python programs
[23:53:12] <cryptosporidium> i don't know! i think i have a really narrow, uh, scope of interests
[23:53:44] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: That does indeed look neat
[23:54:14] <cryptosporidium> imode: was that a big game?
[23:55:04] <ngoldbaum> the day py-spy grew the `—native` option was a good day
[23:56:48] <imode> cryptosporidium: I'm more interested in how you adopted the name without realizing lol.
[23:56:58] <imode> it was a.. decently promoted game, I guess. I played it.
