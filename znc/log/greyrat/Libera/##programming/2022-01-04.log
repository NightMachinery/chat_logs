[00:12:42] <apotheon> user51: more opportunity for productive abstraction in your code
[00:13:25] <apotheon> user51: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity
[00:13:26] <bayaz> Title: Homoiconicity - Wikipedia 
[00:13:33] <ProfSimm> user51: lack of it is basically arbitrary fences between parts of the languages. Between data and code, between types and values. Removing those fences means less redundancy, and more opportunity to build one via the other. Like, build types like you build values
[00:14:17] <apotheon> Homoiconicity makes a lot of "features" that must be added with loads of boilerplate in other languages just exist automatically in the homoiconic language, without any added complexity.
[00:14:20] <ProfSimm> Or build code like your build data.
[00:14:58] <apotheon> Consider serialization, reflection, metaprogramming, and so on.
[00:15:41] <apotheon> Reflection in Java is bureaucracy.  Reflection in Common Lisp is just "What do you mean your language can't read itself?"
[00:15:45] <ProfSimm> On the other hand a DSL is almost always simpler than a general-purpose metaphor that has to build up to that DSL-s functionality (at a high-level). So you need homoiconicity, but you also need the expressivity to build effective DSLs... simplicity ends up complex sometimes. It's one of those paradoxes.
[00:16:26] <apotheon> Building DSLs seems easier with homoiconicity, to me at least.
[00:16:57] <ProfSimm> It is, but if you check out Clojure, to make it more expressive, they added bunch of stuff that made it look like Greek to people
[00:17:14] <apotheon> Clojure is not my favorite LISP.
[00:17:30] <ProfSimm> And if we keep things to basic s-expr it becomes ((paren)) hell for even simple things. It's a very difficult balance of all things. 
[00:17:47] <apotheon> Logo has a nifty solution to the fingernail clippings issue of LISP.
[00:18:18] <ProfSimm> I checked out Logo and I can't understand how it's based on Lisp yet
[00:18:20] <apotheon> It makes them optional, based on the existence of a linguistic awareness of "standard" arity.
[00:18:59] <apotheon> ProfSimm: It's a language expressed in its own core data structure, the list.
[00:19:12] <apotheon> That's pretty much the definition of LISP, in some respects.
[00:19:30] <ProfSimm> Sure
[00:19:31] <apotheon> It's more obvious in UCBLogo than in some half-assed Logo variant.

[02:08:06] <sonny> oof

[02:08:35] <mrig> trafficjam: you can use a sequence diagram for that.
[02:08:55] <sonny> trafficjam some indicator that shows it has a sublist
[02:08:59] <mrig> I think you could, that with use case.
[02:09:05] <sonny> clicking on the indicator will reveal the sublist

[02:15:12] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, there are viruses that infect viruses

[02:15:24] <mrig> so are viruses to be honest.
[02:16:03] <trafficjam> also, how do you render "short" events (e.g. a client meeting) and longer duration events (a large client project spanning many months, with many sub events) together in a consistent way, so that the UI does not get cluttered up with less important information?

[02:20:37] <mrig> That would be one way to summarise it, not very elegant though.
[02:20:40] <trafficjam> i like the idea of the submenu of items, but the problem with that is the chronological order of list elements (and subelements) is then broken

[02:26:46] <mrig> oh workshop and retreat.
[02:27:38] <mrig> trafficjam: you could make a couple of layouts each one preferring a different hierarchy and a way to switch between them?

[02:53:35] <pyzozord> they said "please do not install a vm, our security team says that's not allowed. Also using native tools you will have the same environment as our clients"

[02:55:49] <pyzozord> Byteflux: that's the thing, it's not easier considering how much effort and brain realestate it to learn all macos specific stuff, and it's throw away knoweledge

[02:58:12] <pyzozord> deniska: that's all running in dockers (aka linux containers on linux vm) anyway
[02:58:25] <pyzozord> it's just that all devs within the company use the same setup mac + docker

[03:03:41] <EdFletcher> it's highly possible they already have that knowledge and are just using the library because they know it is well-written and trustworthy and just want to build stuff rather than rewrite something already written better elsewhere 
[03:03:54] <deniska> it'd be good idea to reinstall because it's actually unencrypted, which is kinda icky for a laptop nowadays

[05:21:34] <sonny> like llvm
[05:21:41] <pulse> InPhase, yeah i respect basic and all, but i have no nostalgia for commodore
[05:21:47] <flakland> sonny so what? have you seen the agreement to install visual sstudio recently?
[05:21:56] <flakland> at least gcc has no strings attached
[05:22:01] <pulse> my nostalgia is with DOS and early Windows :D

[05:22:26] <pulse> i definitely want to do a DOS game once
[05:22:29] <sonny> flakland what are you responding to?
[05:22:30] <pulse> sounds fun
[05:22:47] <flakland>  that company is too busy selling people gcc and llvm lol
[05:22:56] <pulse> InPhase, i realize a lot of people love early basic though :)
[05:22:56] <flakland>  --sonny
[05:23:01] <pulse> i watched a lot of 8bit guy
[05:23:03] <sonny> yeah, it's free ... why would I pay for it
[05:23:25] <flakland> to receive a fresh copy of the delphi patchset presumably
[05:23:33] <InPhase> pulse: But, 16 color displays, sprites, and voice-synthesis audio all the way back in the early to mid 80s.  Meanwhile the DOS computers could beep and give you 2 to 4 colors.  :)
[05:23:38] <_73> say I have the grammar `S ::= Val Op Val ; Op ::= + | - ; Val ::= 1 | "foo" | 3`. Given the sentence `1 + "bad"` is the fact that `"bad"` is not a valid `Val` a parse error or a lex error?
[05:23:53] <pulse> InPhase, from what i know about C64, BASIC was slow as hell
[05:24:05] <pulse> InPhase, so if you wanted anything to perform at all you'd have to go assembly
[05:24:09] <sonny> I'm talking about this <https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder>
[05:24:16] <pulse> InPhase, but when you did some crazy results were possible for that early tech
[05:24:26] <_73> Given that there is no terminal symbol "bad" in my grammar I believe it is a lex error but Im not sure.
[05:24:30] <sonny> I'm not paying for delphi either lol
[05:24:36] <pulse> my own journey into tech started with 286 and that's probably the oldest i'd go if i were to program stuff for old systems
[05:24:38] <InPhase> pulse: Well yeah, that's why I first learned how to program in machine code.  I made games, and they didn't go fast enough.
[05:24:49] <pulse> InPhase, nice :)
[05:25:12] <InPhase> pulse: But I didn't own an assembler, so I had to just type in the hex codes...
[05:25:19] <pulse> ugh

[05:25:39] <flakland> i don't get the complaint, you're mad because they sell a product that leverages gcc/llvm ?
[05:26:28] <sonny> _73: that's a parse error
[05:26:53] <PlanckWalk> _73: Yes, I'd call that a lex error since you have a section of input that does not conform to any token.
[05:27:15] <PlanckWalk> Though "parse error" often refers to errors in either tokenization or parsing.
[05:27:18] <InPhase> pulse: Well op codes I guess, as I was doing it in decimal at the time.  I also didn't own a hex editor, so I would write basic programs with lists of numbers that would put my machine code programs into memory.

[09:11:29] <tomathy> anyone want to make a meta cryptography program
[09:12:25] <tomathy> idk how it would work but the basic idea is you ask a series of questions and the user answers them, by the end of it they have designed a cyrptographic hash function
[09:12:43] <tomathy> would that work?
[09:13:06] <mishugana> sounds interesting ... need more details
[09:15:17] <tomathy> haven't though much more about it
[09:15:46] <tomathy> first question would be "length of output"
[09:16:02] <karstensrage> "designed" meaning what
[09:16:08] <whatsupboy> tomathy | is it just me or is it impossible to get a job when you've been out of it for a few years      Should be very hard, but not impossible
[09:16:40] <sonny> tomathy sounds just like shamirs secret sharing algorithm
[09:17:09] <tomathy> cool never heard of that sonny 
[09:17:24] <tomathy> karstensrage: meaning their answers specify the algorithm, sorta
[09:17:50] <karstensrage> so the answer of 12 would be what?
[09:18:27] <mishugana> karstensrage: wrong question :P
[09:19:06] <tomathy> 12 answered first would mean your hash has 12 bytes of output
[09:19:30] <karstensrage> my hackles raise when i hear people talking about doing something with cryptography

[09:19:52] <karstensrage> no

Personally, it is not worth the risk and sacrifice of time and health for a job, not to mention government coming after people when they earn money ...
[09:20:44] <karstensrage> but ive seen some really shitty "security" done by people that thought they knew how to do "cryptography"

[09:22:04] <tomathy> karstensrage: do they get points for effort?

[09:25:49] <PlanckWalk> For crypto "design your own" is for 99.9+% of programmers a terrible idea.

[09:54:00] <tomathy> also if i just drank more water i would lose so much weight

[09:59:32] <zvijezda> mishugana, never better time than the present to learn
[09:59:32] <sonny> mishugana yeah, I wouldn't be in such I dissarray if I could freely
[09:59:43] <mishugana> zvijezda: I really should ... might be a lifesaver some day
[09:59:45] <tomathy> mishugana: if you hold your breath you will float
[09:59:52] <zvijezda> mishugana, my wife also had trouble swimming, but she learned
[09:59:54] <sonny> zvijezda I tried to get lessons again myself, but there was a waitlist
[10:00:05] <tomathy> mishugana: or if you just breath laying on your back
[10:00:07] <sonny> almost drowned at a company function lol
[10:00:08] <mishugana> zvijezda: Ah, that's good to hear ... my friend got fed up trying to teach me. Heh.
[10:00:11] <zvijezda> mishugana, there are some great videos on youtube, and the first lesson I teach is proper breathing
[10:00:13] <InPhase> mishugana: Go in the water and flail your hands and feet around until you learn.  ;)
[10:00:17] <yBtNJW3j> Actually, now I do most of my exercises sitting or lying down to reduce the chance of falling and getting hurt.  No excuses.
[10:00:32] <sonny> InPhase it's 99% kicking water
[10:00:36] <mishugana> zvijezda: Thanks for the tip - I will check out some videos on that
[10:00:47] <tomathy> i would rather be fat than be one of these stupid muscular looking cows
[10:00:47] <mishugana> InPhase: Hahaha
[10:00:55] <mishugana> Maybe I should start in the kiddy pool

[10:01:19] <sonny> tomathy lol
[10:01:19] <zvijezda> mishugana, most pools in a gym are only about 4-5ft deep
[10:01:21] <p4nus2k> haha. i know how to swim but i still won't float even if i hold my breath or relax etc. the only places i've succeeded are the dead sea and the coast of catalonia due to the water being so salty :D
[10:01:25] <sonny> that is my plan
[10:01:29] <InPhase> mishugana: Try underwater swimming first.  You don't have to stress over staying above water.

[10:03:19] <sonny> razzd777 but then you are not really fat
[10:03:21] <mishugana> razzd777: true ... powerlifters and WSM are testament to that... though the latter is turning more muscular by the year

[10:12:31] <tomathy> it's weird cause im 18 stone but i have skinny arms
[10:12:37] <mishugana> Yup .. and a spotter. I am always terrified while doing squats
[10:12:50] <razzd777> you don't have a rack with safety bars mish?

[12:27:18] <EdFletcher> tomathy: `wss://` is to `https://` as `ws://` is to `http://` -- since websockets are just an extension of the HTTP protocol, they inherit HTTP's use of transport-level security (SSL) 
[12:27:53] <tomathy> im using it to send paint data from mouseclick to server
[12:28:18] <EdFletcher> well if you're doing it over non-SSL sockets, then it is not secure (same as HTTP is not secure) 
[12:29:57] <tomathy> not secure meaning, the data is visible?

[12:36:23] <DPA> Websocket (at least version 13) doesn't have much to do with http. It does define the headers to be sent to switch from HTTP to websocket, but after that, it's a completely different protocol.
[12:36:23] <DPA> I could implement & use the protocol without the whole upgrade part, and I could teach a webserver to upgrade HTTP connections to any other protocol. Also, any TCP connection can be wrapped with TLS, that doesn't have anything todo with HTTP either.
[12:38:21] <DPA> I'm not sure how it interacts with HTTP/2, though, they may have reinvented / overcomplicated things there.

[14:41:13] <epony> that's why 90% of servers are Linux, and not Windows
[14:41:41] <nomagno> The ONLY reason GNOME adopted systemd and locked all distros into it was because a RedHat delegate spent a few months convincing the maintainers it was a good idea

[14:45:17] <nomagno> oooh, BSD, also known by the unenlightened as the GNOME-no-run OS :D
[14:45:47] <epony> Gnome actually runs on OpenBSD quite alright, but my computers do not tolerate Gnome3 and KDE4
[14:46:04] <epony> even Gnome2 was heavy and KDE3 was too

[14:46:31] <nomagno> I use XFCE right now, bit too heavy for you perhaps
[14:46:39] <epony> yes, due to the GTK
[14:46:54] <epony> it's like a lighter Gnome, it was independent in the 90ies
[14:47:00] <nomagno> I could get by with raw X
[14:47:08] <epony> yes, that's what I do
[14:47:14] <epony> X and a minimal WM
[14:47:44] <epony> 1px border, no icons, no decoration, keyboard and mouse controlled, stacked, grouping, light and fast
[14:47:50] <nomagno> Is there a good Wayland implementation on freebsd yet?
[14:48:12] <epony> don't know ;-) to me it's just some "decoration" that I don't need
[14:48:27] <epony> maybe it's a Linux thing..

[14:49:06] <epony> hopefully it can be a better X
[14:49:17] <nomagno> Like 30-40% adoption on some distros though!
[14:49:19] <epony> but it will have to be merged in and renamed to X12
[14:49:44] <nomagno> epony: its a different protocol, doesn't cover the exact same API surface

[14:56:27] <DPA> With X, if I want to make a DE, I get working keyboard, mouse, window rendering, for free. Adding window borders & placing windows is tirvial. It works even without any WM and without any compositors.
[14:56:27] <DPA> With wayland, I get almost nothing. I need to do compositing myself, and implement who knows how many APIs/Protocols which are popular at the time just to have something at all usable.
[14:56:27] <DPA> Wayland is no X replacement. Wayland is being afraid of provaiding a useful base layer.

[14:57:45] <epony> it's not a big drama, over time it will move the other direction etc
[14:57:57] <epony> Linux is known for being "recepting" of such swings

[14:58:39] <epony> it was X10 in the past
[14:58:49] <nomagno> I don't think Wayland is a lesser protocol, it gets rid of the API surface that makes X very hard to adapt to all platforms

[15:00:13] <epony> there are larger bugs

[15:00:51] <epony> there are others.. much worse, like glib

[15:01:17] <epony> "I have no strong opinion about it" ;-)

[15:06:15] *** Quits: Themis3000 (~Thunderbi@user/themis3000) (Quit: Themis3000)
[15:06:17] <epony> sounds reasonable and correct to separate the server and display and window managers
[15:06:23] <nomagno> DPA: Well, this is the current setup in the main desktop wayland implementation
[15:06:54] <nomagno> as in, all the compositing and rendering is done (extra-officially you could say) on libweston
[15:07:07] <nomagno> then the client window managers don't need to do much
[15:07:25] <nomagno> It's really not a huge drama, it reduces the size of the protocol to enhance flexibility
[15:07:44] <nomagno> puts a burden on the display server implementor OR the window manager implementor, not both at once
[15:07:52] <epony> the point is, why compositing on the client while it must be the last thing on the server pipeline (where you render, not where you send)

[15:09:44] <nomagno> it's more of a flexibility thing
[15:09:59] <nomagno> some platforms will benefit from the standard not caring about rendering
[15:10:03] <epony> the point is, the BSDs do not do the X stuff, they import that from Xorg

[15:12:04] <nomagno> The current implementations already do an essentially X-equivalent level of work, which is why wayland and the main 'minimal window managers' like Sway already works on FreeBSD
[15:12:43] <nomagno> It's just meant, specifically, to trash X legacy compatibility as an explicit goal, and allow for flexibility on different non-desktop platforms
[15:12:51] <nomagno> No real difference otherwise in many ways
[15:13:05] <DPA> In wayland, one doesn't make a WM. One makes a shell and has to do composition and WM stuff. Also it renders nothing, that's done by the GUI toolkits. It just hands out and composes buffers.
[15:13:05] <DPA> But I think only the WM part is actually really interesting for DEs, and noone should have to bother how to render UI things. Having to redo all that stuff over and over just leads to a bad, inconsistent experience, lots of lost time having to reimplement stuff, and high barriers of entry.

[17:22:58] <user51> here's what i see: the parser goes through a tree corresponding to the grammar, and makes sure that the input matches. and i knew yacc can also match characters, so i figured that we could use the same data structure for both parsing/lexing.

[17:24:24] <mishugana> Just curious - was picking awk a random choice, or were you planning on doing something with it? 
[17:24:29] <user51> i still think i have the whole picture. but it was fun to reason about.
[17:25:19] <mishugana> for me personally, I prefer handcoding the whole thing - so no lex/flex and yacc/bison :) ... just a personal preference though!
[17:25:29] <user51> actually, i think i should be starting with a calculator. something like hoc.
[17:25:43] <mishugana> in that sense, having a scanner generate a stream of tokens works out nicely .. for the parser to consume and decorate
[17:25:46] <user51> or bc. but something simple to get a taste.

[18:51:58] <DnzAtWrk> I'm not pressing that cancel
[18:52:04] <DnzAtWrk> it's likely linked to some kind of popup

[18:56:36] <InPhase> DnzAtWrk: My least favorite popup is the "You are using private-mode browsing, please disable it" popup, which is a really good indicator that I should be using private mode browsing with that site.
[18:56:56] <InPhase> DnzAtWrk: I usually respond to that popup now by disabling javascript for that site.
[18:59:19] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: How did GDPR let them in?
[18:59:20] <DnzAtWrk> I tend to have Javascript disabled by default
[18:59:32] <DnzAtWrk> because GDPR made it seem okay to spam the user with popup questions
[18:59:38] <DnzAtWrk> not just okay, but REQUIRED
[18:59:40] <merijn> I disagree
[18:59:46] <merijn> GDPR doesn't require that at all
[18:59:55] <DnzAtWrk> meh, it sorta does
[19:00:09] <nomagno> It requires you don't track the user until you ask them explicitly to reject or accept your tracking
[19:00:21] <nomagno> Doesn't mandate anything about the form
[19:00:31] <nomagno> most accept/reject cookie messages are visible but not annoying
[19:00:42] <nomagno> they just show a little semi transparent thingy at the top of the page
[19:00:45] <DnzAtWrk> it requires that if your website has non-trivial stuff requiring such things as logins, you are most likely going to need permission
[19:00:54] <merijn> 80-90% of pages are either willfully implementing (ranging from arguably to 100% certainly GDPR violating) popup forms as dark pattern
[19:00:58] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: No

[19:04:22] <merijn> What you need is: A documented "lawful basis" for processing. Of which consent is just one of the possible ones. And arguably the worst one to use as a company/website operator
[19:04:26] <nomagno> Alternatively, it's a dead penguin if you look at it from a 90-degree angle UX
[19:04:38] <merijn> You can't make interaction conditional on consent, so no one ever has a reason to consent
[19:05:07] <DnzAtWrk> I'm glad we need to be lawyers now to design websites
[19:05:30] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: I mean, you don't have to be a lawyer to read the GDPR. It's honestly pretty readable
[19:05:42] <DnzAtWrk> Oh it's not. It's extermely vague
[19:05:48] <DnzAtWrk> is IP PII?
[19:05:57] <InPhase> merijn: I've not bothered to familiarize myself with the GDPR, not being European and not doing webdev, but if you need consent but can't make anything conditional on consent then asking for it doesn't seem to serve much of a legal purpose.
[19:06:04] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: Are you in the US, perchance?
[19:06:08] <nomagno> DnzAtWrk: If you store data tidily, don't sell it, don't republish it, and can delete it/send it on email request, you're compliant
[19:06:21] <DnzAtWrk> No. I'm in EU, avoiding making websites requirng any kind of user info anymore
[19:06:30] <DnzAtWrk> not at all nomagno 
[19:06:30] <merijn> InPhase: Consent is basically "hope someone will indulge you for no benefit to themselves"
[19:06:46] <DnzAtWrk> that's the kind of simplistic thinking that makes people think the GDPR isn't a big deal
[19:06:49] <InPhase> merijn: Which doesn't sound like it benefits you if you're still violating for all the people who don't.
[19:06:49] <DnzAtWrk> "just don't be evil and you're fine"
[19:06:51] <DnzAtWrk> you're really not

[19:07:38] <merijn> InPhase: Are you saying "it sounds like you benefit if you don't follow the law"? Because, well, yeah. Bankrobbing is also profitable if you don't get arrested...
[19:07:43] <nomagno> DnzAtWrk: The GPDR is a very 'spirit of the letter rather than the letter' thing, the enforcer agencies are specifically meant to deal with it in an orderly best-effort basis
[19:08:00] <DnzAtWrk> Spirit of the letter and... what, 2 million fines for breaking it?
[19:08:05] <DnzAtWrk> Yeah that sounds like very spirited

[19:08:24] <merijn> DnzAtWrk: Also, you realise a lot of those fines already existed for 15 years pre-GDPR
[19:08:27] <InPhase> merijn: No, I'm saying asking for consent doesn't seem to be a viable method for compliance if what you have said is true that they are still violating every time someone declines consent and they still have to do all the same things.
[19:08:29] <DnzAtWrk> like, it was some % of revenue or 2 million
[19:08:39] <merijn> InPhase: It isn't
[19:08:42] <nomagno> Uh... Orange got close to that fine I think, but they deserved it
[19:08:48] <merijn> InPhase: If you need consent as a company, you're fucked
[19:08:54] <merijn> InPhase: That's intentional
[19:09:12] <merijn> InPhase: You are *supposed* to be fucked if you need consent, because it means you're doing shady shit you shouldn't be

[19:14:00] <merijn> InPhase: The contract basis basically gives you permission to process any personal information that is required to provide the requested/expected service to a user. So, stuff like payment details and addresses are obviously covered by that for a webshop, so you'd never need a consent popup for that.
[19:14:03] <nomagno> merijn: Apparently, Google has as justification for not turning off tracking under any circumstance "We offer a browser complement to disable analytics, and to disable cookie-based tracking you can disable cookies in your browser"
[19:14:18] <nomagno> Which is the equivalent of NOT providing service

[20:13:07] <bjs> ProfSimm: okay, there's no real technical reason why it's not possible (although varargs and currying don't play nice together).
[20:13:27] <ProfSimm> bjs: oh yeah also var args and optional arguments
[20:13:31] <bjs> But I don't know any language that does it, and tbh I don't see the benefit

[20:14:33] <bjs> ProfSimm: the problem with currying and varargs/optional arguments is how do you know when you've finished passing all the arguments.  You need some kind of "call now" token,  it's a bit ugly and that's probably why they avoid it.

[21:58:56] <upp> sure how to get there
[21:59:43] <[itchyjunk]> 2 things intersect each other if 2 things pass through a common point
[21:59:56] <[itchyjunk]> you figure out at what point line 1 = line 2
[22:00:08] <[itchyjunk]> also, if you have a pair of point, you have a line, not a line segment
[22:00:10] <mawk> x will be the same and y will be the same
[22:00:16] <mawk> at the point of intersection
[22:00:17] <[itchyjunk]> what about z?
[22:00:22] <mawk> z is a lie
[22:00:26] <mawk> doesn't exist
[22:00:28] <upp> lol

[22:01:01] <[itchyjunk]> filthy string theorists
[22:01:15] <[itchyjunk]> the modern version, m theory, has 11
[22:01:17] <mawk> the other 5 dimensions are folded in my pocket
[22:01:22] <user51> string theorists will give up, all you need to do is give them c :)
[22:01:24] <mawk> I use them for storage
[22:01:40] <[itchyjunk]> i doubt string theorists will give up
[22:02:10] <sonny> have to go paint, afk
[22:02:13] <mrig> once they clue into it being sound not strings, they will move forwards :P
[22:03:20] <upp> i think i could figure out the math if i actually had two "equations of a line", but i still dont know how to get there.  given two coordinates i guess i can find the slope, but im not sure what the add would be in relation to the other line

[23:47:33] <[itchyjunk]> i don't like thinking about large codebases with large number of people adding and substracting thing from it
[23:47:50] <dodo> i unit tests code that i write for myself only..
[23:48:05] <[itchyjunk]> well, if you like it fine and well
[23:48:13] <dodo> it's good engineering
[23:48:24] <[itchyjunk]> i feel like making every thing modular is just added extra cost that is not always benifitial
[23:48:40] <dodo> fair enough
[23:49:01] <[itchyjunk]> i see value for it when its large and many hands add and remove thing from it
[23:49:06] <dodo> when i re-read my code a few weeks later, the less complex it is the easier it is to work with it again
[23:49:15] <[itchyjunk]> but that scale is beyond me so i dont even think about it
[23:49:36] <[itchyjunk]> well idk if modular is always less complex in the larger scope of things
[23:49:42] <[itchyjunk]> kinda reminds me of OOP style
[23:50:00] <dodo> smaller units -> less complexity in the units
[23:50:19] <dodo> and unless you're on corp scale the interaction between the units should be fairly easy
[23:50:22] <[itchyjunk]> i disagress that smaller units always implies less complexity
[23:50:36] <GeDaMo> Look at node.js and leftpad :P

[23:51:09] <[itchyjunk]> i think heavily codependent code can be assimilated into a single larger unit and still have lower ocmplexity that every piece being modularaized
[23:51:11] <dodo> [itchyjunk]: if you abuse language features to reduces loc maybe
[23:51:13] <[itchyjunk]> GeDaMo, elaborate? :S
[23:51:29] <GeDaMo> There are a lot of very small node modules

[23:55:59] <[itchyjunk]> I feel like large scale code benifits form difffent optimization than small ones. I remember very rececntly reading firefoxes test article. it was good. they talked about how all the unit tests was adding costs
[23:56:12] <[itchyjunk]> cause any tiny change in code needed millions of tests to run
[23:56:21] <[itchyjunk]> hmm wonder if i can find that article again

[23:57:36] <[itchyjunk]> making unit testable code for everything is benifitial at some goldi lock range
[23:57:43] <[itchyjunk]> but i don't believe its universal
[23:58:19] <[itchyjunk]> "While we don’t test against every possible combination of the above, there are still over 90 unique configurations that we do test against. In other words, for each change that developers push to the repository, we could potentially run all 85k tests 90 different times. On an average work day we see nearly 300 pushes (including our testing branch). If we simply ran every test on every configuration on every push, we’d 
[23:58:19] <[itchyjunk]> run approximately 2.3 billion test files per day! "
[23:58:26] <dodo> knowing how to unit test is still beneficial
[23:58:47] <[itchyjunk]> yes but not one disputed that either though
[23:58:56] <nomagno> GeDaMo: A more important question: Why the heck do you ever include a module that does left padding?

[23:59:32] <dodo> [itchyjunk]: you asked if knowing how to write testable code is a benefit
