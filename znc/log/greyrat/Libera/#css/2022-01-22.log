[06:37:47] <hmw[at]> Sqaure: Sometimes you can use a border to influence collapsing. Try rgba(0,0,0,0) makes it invisble, in case it helped.

[06:51:13] <theskillwithin> i hate margin collapsing
[06:51:28] *** Quits: silverdust (~silverdus@user/silverdust) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[06:54:59] <hmw[at]> Especially with floating elements
[06:57:01] <theskillwithin> I always make sure to double check, even triple check if everything is aligned and spaced correctly to the design.  when i made a mistake and its not, its usually due to margin collapsing
[06:58:26] <hmw[at]> Just upload a bitmap and use an image map
[07:00:53] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] hm?
[07:01:06] <hmw[at]> That was meant to be sarkasm
[07:01:13] <theskillwithin> ah
[07:01:34] <hmw[at]> So far they will not mess up an image you upload. You know, because the browser knows better and such.
[07:01:58] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] one thing I like about Zeplin is it has a feature where you can make a window of the design semi transparent, and you can drag it over your browser window to see if everything is aligned.  I have not been able to find the same feature in figma which I use much more
[07:02:51] <hmw[at]> I don't know either tools, and I never tried to be THAT pixel perfect. INteresting idea tho. And you could even do it in pure CSS

[07:09:29] <hmw[at]> I did pixel perfect designs, but never had to replicate a page from a given image with it having to be the exact same for every pixel. You need browser switches for that, right?
[07:09:37] <hmw[at]> That'd be quite a pain.
[07:10:04] <hmw[at]> Line height. I hate it.
[07:10:18] <theskillwithin> Figma tells you the line height of everything
[07:10:30] <theskillwithin> heck Figma even gives you some of the css properties
[07:10:37] <hmw[at]> But FF and Chrome render it differently. FF always shifting the text upwards by one px
[07:10:56] <theskillwithin> and the fonts render differently

[07:11:18] <hmw[at]> Well. How can you then even achieve pixel perfection?
[07:11:44] <hmw[at]> Upload the page as image and put invisible text over it or what
[07:11:47] <theskillwithin> I can get the spacing perfect, the fonts is a different story
[07:12:20] <pavonia> What's a use case where you need pixel-perfect solutions? Games?
[07:12:33] <theskillwithin> a good UX designer prob makes way more than me, prob $150k+ so really would be kind of disrespectful for me not to make it perfect to the designers vision
[07:12:51] <hmw[at]> Games perhaps, but if you're free to change details, you don't even have to be that perfect. Most often it is just the boss who thinks it is required.

[07:13:38] <hmw[at]> It is one thing to have columns shift by a pixel, but having to make the font look exactly like in Photoshop seems nonsensical to me
[07:13:47] <Sqaure> css is so damn hard and time consuming
[07:13:53] <theskillwithin> the fonts never look the same
[07:15:01] <hmw[at]> Hm. With a lot of experience, I don't find the general layout so hard to make correct tho. It still is a lot of fiddeling and sometimes trying things until I find something that works across all browsers.
[07:15:08] <theskillwithin> which we account for because of that,  have meetings with the designer with the fonts displayed on the acctual frontend.   sometimes the designer themselfs will do a little frontend example with the fonts.   just cuz they will look different in the browser than Figma or Sketch or PS

[07:17:52] <hmw[at]> I made a bunch of games with "semantic html" and CSS (poker table for example). I think it is not a good idea to try that. My game lost 2 features (visual things don't look as good anymore, ie. dragropping the cards is now suddenly an icon instead of the card)
[07:18:45] <hmw[at]> Another thing is that when I hover a card, the back sides of some other cards get blurry since half a year ago

[13:44:01] <Bushmaster> greetings folks, it may be off topic, just quick inquiry, I have set up Apache web server for my PHP file to run. What I am curious to know is, is it possible to change the default page of Apache which shows Index of ... and embed my own HTML/CSS page to make it look nice

[21:28:25] <velix> hassoon: no, but I'm no frontend guy. That's why I wasn't around here.
[21:28:27] <velix> What unit do you modern kids work in today? still "rem"?
[21:28:35] <velix> or px ?
[21:28:45] <velix> or %
[21:28:49] <velix> or meters
[21:29:04] <velix> or vh
[21:30:34] <eXtr3m0> I found px on :root + rem in components + somtimes em within a component
[21:31:01] <eXtr3m0> so you can just change px on root for different viewports.
[21:32:01] <eXtr3m0> I tried to play around with vh/vw and it's certainly very interesting for components that fill up the whole screen. but I think I wouldn't use it in any global approach.
[21:33:01] <eXtr3m0> And I am waiting for container queries to arrive. Finally. Long overdue.
[21:34:08] <velix> eXtr3m0: yeah, makes sense

[22:57:04] <friend> How can I vertically adjust the positioning of a span within a paragraph? I have a lock symbol next to a label and I need it to be font-height:50% but centered vertically. Any suggestions?
[22:57:10] *** Joins: highrate (~presonic@user/highrate)
[23:09:51] <eXtr3m0> vertical-align and line-height properties might help.
[23:10:07] <eXtr3m0> otherwise I think there is also inline-flex which could help you, but I didn't play around with it much.
[23:27:19] <friend> Thanks. I'll try them next. Unfortunately I got display:table and display:table-cell to work, but I think that's pretty frowned upon. I'll check out your suggestions, thx.
[23:28:50] <eXtr3m0> Yeah they seem out of place nowadays. Should be a straight forward solution with the props I mentioned.
[23:33:50] <friend> Got it worked out with flex, thanks for the advice. Much nicer.
