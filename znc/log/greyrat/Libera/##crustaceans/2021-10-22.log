[00:44:37] <dimadima> the only thing that gives me pause about lisp is the lack of types; the parens are honestly very attractive to me
[00:45:00] <dimadima> and everything else that i know about it
[00:47:22] <dimadima> seems pretty nice
[00:50:26] <pja> See, what you obviously want is Haskell+Lisp! The best (worst?) of both worlds?
[00:50:41] <pja> (This is actually a thing, or has been a thing several times. Eg https://axellang.github.io/ )
[00:50:41] <buttsbot> Axel
[00:52:00] <pja> or https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp which has static inferred types & is merely written in Haskell :)

[00:52:06] <dimadima> **said like "valley girl"**: sorry pja but i only code in _production_ languages
[00:52:28] <pja> Look, alpha release research prototypes is all I have right now.
[00:52:43] <dimadima> :)
[00:52:47] <pja> Spare a poor programmer some () ?
[00:53:29] <dimadima> i suspect lisps despite the typelessness are pretty awesome
[00:53:40] <dimadima> i also do want to forth
[00:54:27] <pja> Alexis King went slightly mad at some point and did this: https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2017/01/02/rascal-a-haskell-with-more-parentheses/
[00:54:27] <buttsbot> Rascal: a Haskell with more parentheses
[00:54:35] <dimadima> there should be a keybinding for lisping though where the () are closer and available w/o shifting
[00:54:41] <imode> forth is aight. use a forth with quotations!
[00:54:52] <dimadima> i vim a lot and i rebound caps to escape. w/o that i'd be in literal pain
[00:55:18] <dimadima> pja: hah
[01:00:52] <pja> There’s also Lisk, who’s author states: Lisk is 100% abandoned; interested parties are actively (and nicely!) discouraged.
[01:01:20] <pja> In other words, this idea attracts PhD students like wasps to strawberry jam.
[01:01:39] <pja> (PL researchers in general probably.)
[01:02:46] <companion_cube> imode: don't you feel like a fishmonger in Texas sometimes? :D
[01:02:53] <companion_cube> peddling forth to lisp addicts… good luck
[01:04:50] <imode> companion_cube: ey, you can use something like factor or retro and have lispy stuff.
[01:04:57] <imode> just postfix.
[01:05:07] <ngoldbaum> texas has good fish tho
[01:05:27] <ngoldbaum> if you’re ok with gulf coast fish
[01:10:08] <dimadima> pja: lol
[01:10:15] <dimadima> fortunately i'm not a PhD student
[01:10:22] <dimadima> i waste my time doing other things
[01:11:10] <pja> Every PL PhD student has probably learnt just enough type theory & compiler theory to make a typed Lisp. But not enough experience to realise that they probably shouldn’t.
[01:11:20] * pja is off to bed.
[01:11:39] <dimadima> night pja
[01:15:20] <dimadima> forth seemed to be huge on HN out of nowhere like half a year ago
[01:15:24] <dimadima> day after day of forth
[01:15:33] <dimadima> got me looking at it and it seems pretty interesting
[01:15:46] <dimadima> danluu is still #1 though today. what a shitty day on HN
[01:16:53] <ngoldbaum> today’s stupid discourse
[01:16:56] <ngoldbaum> him and PG
[01:18:16] *** Quits: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost) (Quit: mew wew)
[01:27:20] <kline> the danluu one is "i am very smart (so smart in fact that you cant even tell how smart i am and it looks stupid instead)"
[01:29:01] <kline> which to me just sounds not smart but actually stupid because its basically a case of the xy problem
[01:32:54] <imode> I will say I'm considering a lispy frontend to my little compiler here.. underneath it looks like a stack machine but that's trivial to resolve.
[01:44:38] <dimadima> what makes a front end lispy
[01:50:28] <imode> s-expressions and LISP-1 style bootstrapping.
[01:51:33] <dimadima> what language is the compiler written in?
[01:51:49] <imode> currently? no language right now, I'm still plotting out the IR.
[01:51:53] <imode> and what that looks like.
[01:52:11] <imode> I have a feeling it's just going to be a sequence of tokens, kind of like a "higher bytecode".
[01:53:16] <imode> the IR should be an interpretable shorthand, so you'll still have access to the base command set, []01<>.
[01:53:21] <dimadima> the compiler is a program, and the front end is the part of the compiler that parses/lexes the code and transforms it into IR
[01:53:25] <dimadima> ^ my understanding
[01:53:34] <imode> mhm!
[01:53:42] <imode> that's correct.
[01:53:56] <dimadima> so that being the case, what would make it lispy. i understand you wrote "s-expressions and LISP-1 style bootstrapping." but i still dont get that
[01:54:23] <dimadima> and i understand s-expressions (not lisp-1 style bootstrapping, but maybe that's not so important here?)
[01:54:30] <imode> oh. so, the "front-end" is also swappable with the term "front-end language". so compiling a lispy lang down to IR.
[02:00:23] <imode> https://hastebin.com/raw/utepajilor here's the factorial example in IR form.
[02:00:27] <imode> well, working.
[02:09:13] <dimadima> that's a lot more concise than the previous thing i saw
[02:11:29] <dimadima> is this factorial(5) again?
[02:15:03] <dimadima> my package back up to 2k weekly downloads hooray https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-prosemirror. fun thins about this thing is it has more GH stars than lines of code
[02:15:26] <imode> yup, it's factorial(5).
[02:17:09] <imode> the zero() and push_zero() stuff at the beginning is effectively just allocating space for the logic to do its thing.
[02:17:28] <imode> pushing roughly 9 bytes worth of data.
[02:26:30] <dimadima> the deque needs to be allocated with certain space?
[02:26:43] <imode> right. this is a direct transcription from brainfuck code.
[02:27:04] <imode> brainfuck's "background" is a tape that's already got 30k bytes worth of memory, and you start of looking at cell 0.
[02:27:11] <imode> *start off
[02:27:36] <imode> when an FV3 program starts, the deque is empty. so in order for the brainfuck-style logic to work, we need to provide some cells for it to do its work on.
[02:40:52] <dimadima> but the cells are already there?
[02:41:19] <dimadima> wait position and memory are different
[02:41:38] <dimadima> position is instructions and memory is a data structure (deque, in this case) is my understanding
[02:42:07] <dimadima> as in, my understanding of a turning machine is that you have a tape of cells and each cell has an instruction
[02:44:39] <imode> ohhh no no no.
[02:44:42] <imode> not at all.
[02:45:30] <imode> so, there are two components to a turing machine: the finite state machine (which controls the read/write head's position on the tape), and the tape itself.
[02:46:26] <imode> you can imagine the FSM as an actual "black box" that can emit signals for which symbol to write to the tape and which way to move the tape given what symbol it's read from the tape and which state it's currently in.

[03:00:29] <ngoldbaum> imode: it’s an almost literal adaptation of the book, kinda star warsy, very on-the-nose
[03:00:36] <ngoldbaum> indigo: on hbo max yeah
[03:01:19] <imode> so that's... good?
[03:01:23] <imode> never read dune.
[03:04:00] <Church> First three books are good
[03:04:03] <Church> Ignore after that
[03:04:42] <ngoldbaum> if you’ve never read the books it’ll hit different
[03:05:08] <ngoldbaum> it’s *so* literal an adaptation, lots of word-for-word using dialog from the book

[03:54:22] <Church> Not much I think
[03:54:37] <ngoldbaum> it’s not really traditional combat
[03:55:14] <ngoldbaum> but like choices you make in the conversation interface can impact certain action scenes
[03:55:43] <ngoldbaum> and your skill points impact the dice roll chances in the conversation interface
[03:56:11] <companion_cube> so it must be pretty chill to play
[03:56:17] <ngoldbaum> it’s a really clever system for a narrative heavy RPG
[03:57:44] <ngoldbaum> yes it can be, you also have to adopt certain moral and political positions and no matter what you pick the game will make fun of and critique your choices via the characters and your internal monologue which is communicated as like the embodiments of your skills which talk to you

[11:27:31] <gerikson> I personally think the post and the replies are skating after where the puck is now
[11:27:56] <gerikson> like, realistically, almost no-one except pros and enthusiasts use a computer as opposed to a phone
[11:28:24] <gerikson> so the use case of "using a computer to email and consume media" is almost irrelevant to most people

[12:40:01] <buttsbot> Twatter - Aella_Girl - good chance you think at least one nonharmful sexual fetish should be illegal, because it rubs up against your disgust sensi...
[12:41:12] <pja> Yup. The sex-adjacent Tweet, which gets widely shared in HN-adjacent circles & now she has another bunch of Only Fans followers. She’s very good at it.
[12:41:31] <pja> & I don’t want to be anti sex work here. People gotta eat & all that.
[12:41:54] <gerikson> yeah I'm fine with that
[12:42:19] <pja> & Getting your name out there is how this works. Reputation based economy & all that.
[12:42:33] <pja> (this == the world, not just sex work.)
[12:43:34] <gerikson> agreed
[12:59:04] <pja> Playing the HN nerd demographic without them realising that they’re being played is Art imo.

[15:55:38] <buttsbot> That Tungsten Company Is Auctioning Its Largest-Ever Cube as an NFT
[16:02:35] <kline> i have nothing against small/medium business and individuals milking cryptobros for nft dollars
[16:08:50] <gerikson> yeah, good point
[16:11:21] <deadk> it's still PR for NFTs
[16:14:04] <riv> shouldn't the governments regulate (i.e. ban) all this crypto shit
[16:14:13] <riv> it's pretty clear that all it does it destroy the planet more
[16:15:05] <deadk> it took them 50 years to figure out that climate change even existed
[16:16:06] <Brekkjern> I don't think spending an iota of energy trying to get it banned would actually accomplish anything at all
[16:16:33] <Brekkjern> And IOTA is aparrently a shitcoin...
[16:18:18] <gerikson> I think we should continue to point and laugh
[16:23:14] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but that is different from trying to take bandwidth from politicians to get something banned
[16:23:32] <Brekkjern> Actually banning NFTs and crypto currencies will be immensely difficult
[16:24:00] <deadk> might be worth it
[16:24:02] <Brekkjern> And I don't mean "Yeah there is a law saying it's not allowed" but functionally stopping people from engaging in it in a "productive" way
[16:24:09] <deadk> it's only going to get harder
[16:24:22] <riv> well they stop people growing weed
[16:24:41] <Brekkjern> My point is that banning something and enforcing that ban is two entirely different things, and the first part is pointless unless you also do the second part
[16:24:49] <Brekkjern> riv: How is that going for them?

[17:01:38] <companion_cube> so, SPACs are people investing in something they don't know yet?
[17:01:45] <companion_cube> (about the trump venture, lolol)
[17:02:06] <dimadima> the trump thing is an SPAC??!
[17:04:16] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: the way to ban it is to take out the mining centers.  That will make a significant impact.
[17:05:12] <gerikson> hit them with tax avoidance and defrauding public utilities
[17:05:43] <gerikson> dimadima: https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738240/donald-trump-truth-social-spac-dwac-stock-merger
[17:05:43] <buttsbot> Donald Trump’s new social media SPAC, explained - The Verge
[17:06:02] <dimadima> it's probably easier to police mining that weed
[17:06:05] <dimadima> than*
[17:06:26] <dimadima> gerikson: lol

[17:08:50] <dimadima> something about a war on crypto way different than a war on drugs
[17:08:55] <dimadima> seems way different*
[17:09:16] <gerikson> the Verge says the presentation has to be seen to be believed, and they're not wrong https://tmtgcorp.com/company-overview/
[17:09:20] <dimadima> we just need a republican administration to kick things off
[17:09:38] <gerikson> who can't wait for Trump AWS?
[17:10:00] <gwozniak> You won't believe the downtime!
[17:10:33] <dimadima> gwozniak: is that "downtime" in a positive sense?
[17:10:46] <gwozniak> The ambiguity is a feature
[17:10:52] <gerikson> ``Meanwhile, the Terms of Service for Truth Social include a rule that prohibits users from disparaging Truth on the platform — despite TMTG promoting Truth as a “big tent” where “all are welcome.” You are also not allowed to write posts with too many capital letters.''
[17:10:57] <dimadima> alternative facts platform
[17:11:01] <gerikson> that last I can get behind
[17:11:10] <gwozniak> oh the irony
[17:11:18] <dimadima> lol
[17:11:49] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: I don't think you can meaningfully stop mining centers. You can prevent datacenter size operations, but not smaller ones. Enforcing a ban on smaller operations means increased surveilance methods to deal with it, and even that would probably not help as you could just VPN the connection to make it appear somewhere else.
[17:12:25] <gerikson> Brekkjern: they are using a lot of electricty
[17:12:38] <dimadima> Brekkjern: ^
[17:12:38] <Brekkjern> gerikson: Yes, so are weed operations, and they still manage to run
[17:12:49] <dimadima> even small operations would use wayyy more electricity than avg
[17:12:53] <gerikson> I'm only against crapto for the energy waste, I'm totally fine with people wasting mooney on beanie babies otherwaise
[17:12:58] <dimadima> you'd neveed great covers
[17:13:24] <dimadima> gerikson: you make a good point there
[17:13:29] <dimadima> we need to ban beanie babies
[17:13:40] <Brekkjern> It's not illegal to use a lot of energy. It is a marker for crypto/weed growing, but it should never be enough to generate a warrant IMO
[17:13:43] <gerikson> Brekkjern: it's an order magnitude more
[17:13:56] <gwozniak> Yeah, it's amazingly high
[17:14:14] <gerikson> I mean, what does it cost to light / heat a decent indoor grow op>?
[17:14:14] <gwozniak> Like, they use abandoned power plants
[17:14:18] <Brekkjern> My point isn't the power consumption. My point is what powers you give police to actually enforce that ban.
[17:14:19] <dimadima> yeah there are many stories of copys thinking they're about to bust a weed farm but they show up and it's mining
[17:14:31] <gerikson> I dunno how much, but there's a top cap, if you don't want to dessicate the plants
[17:14:43] <gerikson> there is NO UPPER LIMIT for how much it takes to mine
[17:14:56] <Brekkjern> Imagine you get a new pool, and you heat it. Suddenly you've crossed a power usage threshold and the SWAT team breaches your house.
[17:15:12] <gerikson> doesn't have to be police, the power company has a lot of .. power
[17:15:20] <dimadima> Brekkjern: i don't think it's in the same magnitude
[17:15:34] <dimadima> also the usage patterns are quite distinct
[17:15:36] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Depends on how quickly you want to heat the pool
[17:15:36] <companion_cube> you could have non linear pricing on electricity
[17:15:43] <companion_cube> for residential neighborhoods
[17:15:57] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: That is much more realistic IMO
[17:16:00] <dimadima> anyway i don't actually want to ban mining
[17:16:01] <companion_cube> so that normal usage is cheap, but if you start using a lot you pay quadratically more for the excess
[17:16:10] <companion_cube> doesn't ban mining, just makes it economically useless
[17:16:12] <gerikson> money doesn't stink, but you're in business with people who are super-shady, can ditch their op as soon as the hardware is outdated, w/o paying their bills
[17:16:15] <dimadima> banning things is a waste of human energy
[17:16:15] <Brekkjern> I want that in Norway even
[17:16:22] <prussian> gerikson: >TMTG will be a fountainhead
[17:16:24] <companion_cube> also it'd be useful for water
[17:16:26] <prussian> lmao'd
[17:16:44] <prussian> Trump did it, we brought in Ayn Rand into it!
[17:16:52] <gerikson> you can appear and say "I am an aluminium smelter" and you're good
[17:16:57] <gwozniak> My view is similar to gerikson's: you can have crapto, but the scaled up version of it is just a scam and a total waste of energy
[17:17:07] <gerikson> ``The SPAC’s chief financial officer is Luis Orleans-Braganza — a serial entrepreneur who is also a current member of Brazil’s National Congress, was a member of Jair Bolsonaro’s former party, and the son of the heir to Brazil’s defunct throne.''
[17:17:17] <Brekkjern> I'm not saying that it would be impossible to detect it happening, but I am saying that you have to be careful with what methods you give police to enforce that ban.

[17:19:27] <dimadima> lol
[17:19:51] <companion_cube> can you even smelt aluminium at home?
[17:20:14] <prussian> it would be very expensive.
[17:20:14] <Brekkjern> You'd risk getting your door broken down because you'd look like a grow op :P
[17:21:29] <Brekkjern> One of the aluminium plants in Norway consumes about 5% of Norways entire energy production
[17:22:02] <Brekkjern> Or 6.5TWh over a year
[17:22:29] <Brekkjern> That article is about 10 years old, so it might have changed though
[17:26:32] <companion_cube> it blows my mind that growing weed can get your door kicked
[17:26:39] <companion_cube> like, how is that not disproportionate

[18:16:53] <prussian> Do you guys like work in the same room?
[18:16:58] <prussian> how do you do it?
[18:22:34] <Xe> yeah we work in the same room
[18:22:47] <Xe> it usually works out, our meetings don't usually collide
[18:23:26] <Xe> however when we get our house we are definitely getting a 3 bedroom house so we can have separate offices and I can make pithy comments about commute to the office
[18:24:07] <prussian> lol.
[18:24:11] <prussian> well good luck.
[18:30:18] <Xe> we had about a year of both of us commuting to work at separate places every day and then covid hit so it became full time remote work for both of us
[18:30:28] <Xe> i kinda prefer full time remote work, he's started to
[18:31:01] <Xe> i expect him to only take remote only jobs in the future
[18:33:36] <prussian> I have mixed feelings about it.
[18:33:46] <prussian> Depends if I like the team or not.
[18:34:07] <prussian> I've been bonding with a few people at work lately and we have this thursdays in-office thing.
[18:34:26] <prussian> so I don't know. in person means I can wag the finger at people not paying attention in meetings too.
[18:35:03] <companion_cube> but can you use CAPSLOCK in person?
[18:35:35] <prussian> yes.
[18:35:44] <prussian> my life is capslock

[18:37:28] <Xe> i hate people feeling entitled to interrupt me randomly
[18:37:44] <Xe> and in this working climate you're either crammed into a loud open office or working from home
[18:37:54] <Xe> so i'm working from home when i can
[18:38:11] <prussian> there is something mind numbing about driving I both love and hate.
[18:38:16] <prussian> It's weird.
[18:38:17] <prussian> for me
[18:38:19] <prussian> personally

[18:38:50] <prussian> You'd hate me then. I am loud and say all sorts of things.

[18:40:20] <prussian> ya, I bet lmao.
[18:42:28] <prussian> But in person, I learned this one chick, who I barely interacted with, is some renegade bad ass who's had a brain herniation, ovarian cancer, who hates rules. real hero, inspiration even.
[18:42:50] <prussian> that kind of intimate knowledge just doesn't seem to happen over the net, at least in a work like setting.
[18:42:53] <prussian> as far as I can see.
[18:44:58] <Xe> this is going to sound like i am making things up

[18:46:00] <prussian> I don't know man... In person? I don't care as much since most people aren't out to get you.
[18:46:16] <prussian> but on like Teams or whatever, I just don't trust it.
[18:46:43] <prussian> Then again some of these new guys are sending twitch memes at me so I started saying "poggers" instead of the thumbs up reaction.
[18:51:51] <gwozniak> I like working from home, but I do miss just general conversation and stuff in the office.  That's why my local coworkers and I get together every now and then for an extended lunch

[19:42:49] <imode> as in "I don't wanna go out there, and I don't have to".
[19:42:54] <dimadima> there's a saying in russian that doesn't translate nicely but it's something like "nature has no bad weather"
[19:42:55] <imode> that's a recipe for a cozy day.
[19:42:59] <dimadima> it rhymes in russian
[19:43:14] <dimadima> i'm solid on the "nature has no bad weather" bandwagon

[19:46:25] <jlindgren[m]> chicago is sort of wonderful in the winter - i was there for a few months consulting. NY might have more charm, but chicago is almost just as cool to experience.
[19:47:33] <defect> new york is nice if you get a decent snowfall that stays for a while. but then it turns in to a big garbage slushee :P
[19:48:37] <dimadima> new york winters are great

[19:49:28] <dimadima> sometimes i'd look at weather in North Pole, Alaska and it was warmer

[19:51:19] <dimadima> jlindgren[m]: maybe you had good gear :)
[19:52:26] <jlindgren[m]> that could be it - I'm in nebraska and it gets pretty cold here sometimes. i miss traveling.
[19:55:35] <dimadima> jlindgren[m]: oh nice! yeah i bet nebraska gets cold
[19:55:49] <dimadima> how's nebraska? i've been a few times and it was really pretty
[19:56:10] <dimadima> no joke with the golden waving fields of wheat
[19:56:25] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Jarlsberg is one of the two most popular regular cheeses on the market here, yes :)
[19:56:48] <jlindgren[m]> its nice - i grew up out in the middle of the state where we have the "sand hills" its basically like a rolling desert with a thin layer of grass on it. its wild.
[19:57:40] <Brekkjern> dimadima: I'm not sure if the ones you'd get are the exact same we get, but it's probably rather similar

[20:03:08] <dimadima> Brekkjern: oh that's cool. i'm a big fan, it's a great cheese. balance of "eatability" and still some good flavor
[20:03:31] <dimadima> Brekkjern: yeah i wonder if you get the same; some of ours is apparenty made in ireland or ohio
[20:03:45] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Yeah. It's not my favourite, but it's pretty good.
[20:03:53] <companion_cube> wow damn
[20:03:55] <dimadima> jlindgren[m]: woah i didn't know you had sand hills and grass.... got to look that up
[20:04:19] <dimadima> Brekkjern: is your favorite exported to your knowledge? did you know jarlsberg is pretty big in the states?
[20:05:48] <Brekkjern> dimadima: My preferred regualr cheese is Norvegia (preferrably the slightly longer matured one than the regular one), but I have no idea if it's exported. I had heard that Jarlsberg was well regarded outside Norway and that it was exported a lot, but I didn't know it was a big thing
[20:31:26] <dimadima> ah cool i'll keep an eye out for norvegia. i wouldn't say jarslberg is a big thing but over the last 10 years or so it went being a specialty cheese to being pretty common

[22:22:05] <indigo> Pretty similar to any other phone interview, except the problem didn't require any algorithms fancier than a hashmap

[23:38:34] <companion_cube> was it that horrible for the whole 2 years?
[23:38:37] <imode> I think the thing that broke me today was that my manager pulled me into a 1:1 to discuss a fucking escalation regarding my tone about an issue.
[23:38:41] <riv> yeah if your life makes you unhappy you should change it a bit, don't just wait years and years (did this and it was actually really bad for me and I regret it)

[23:38:58] <gerikson> fuck that
[23:39:02] <companion_cube> unhappy is a thing, but burnt out is another

"the next steps are essentially 'wait until we fix it'. you're free to create a deployment request, here's a wiki: <wiki>"
[23:40:24] <ngoldbaum> not kidding about that ulcer thing, especially if you drink much
[23:40:26] <imode> someone apparently took lightning-fast offense to this, got an L8 to complain to my manager about how I was handling this issue, while I was in the middle of fixing it.
[23:40:38] <companion_cube> for telling them "here's the wiki" ???!
[23:40:40] <imode> ngoldbaum: oh fuck drinking I just mainline several hundred milligrams of CBD every day.
[23:41:15] <imode> I wish I was kidding. "did you feel frustrated in this situation?" "no, I was performing triage with the 50 other issues that happened in the meantime"
[23:41:47] <imode> I'm not kidding about that. if I could export this fucking graph from this dashboard it'd shock you. 500 issues per month at minimum.
