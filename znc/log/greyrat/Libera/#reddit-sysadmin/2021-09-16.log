[02:00:42] <shibboleth> yeah, yeah, git it. but it still has no bearing on just how wrong/much of a jumble int0x1C8 boss statement is
[02:00:43] <int0x1C8> he's saying that means the switch isn't configured correctly and the network won't work 
[02:00:46] <shibboleth> got it
[02:01:25] <int0x1C8> 253 is our firewall by the way
[02:01:41] <shibboleth> still, he could be right given this: if the switch is pulling its config from somewhere else
[02:02:23] <int0x1C8> he's saying the fact it can't traceroute means it can't find the route to the destination, but it can ping so obviously it can
[02:03:25] <int0x1C8> he's asserting that if ping works traceroute should always work too
[02:03:43] <shibboleth> no, that's the opposite of what you just said that he said?
[02:04:10] <int0x1C8> what?
[02:04:50] <shibboleth> your last two statements are opposite
[02:05:16] <int0x1C8> which ones
[02:05:25] <shibboleth> <int0x1C8> he's saying the fact it can't traceroute means it can't find the route to the destination, but it can ping so obviously it can
[02:05:25] <shibboleth> <int0x1C8> he's asserting that if ping works traceroute should always work too
[02:06:25] <int0x1C8> right, his assertion is the second statement, after which statement 1 must logically follow

[02:09:56] <shibboleth> ehm, these on the same subnet?
[02:10:03] <int0x1C8> yes

[02:10:56] <CableNinja> ping and traceroute have nothing to do with network functionality
[02:11:04] <CableNinja> they both rely on ICMP packets to get their information
[02:11:12] <shibboleth> so yeah, in that case you can ping without traceroute working
[02:11:21] <shibboleth> and traceroute won't work event hough ping will
[02:11:31] <CableNinja> ^ depending on the network configuration
[02:11:38] <shibboleth> on the same subnet
[02:11:47] <CableNinja> should still work, it will just give you single hop

[02:12:45] <int0x1C8> yes I said that, then he says "then why doesn't traceroute work?"
[02:12:58] <CableNinja> because the network isnt configured to allow traceroutes
[02:13:41] <shibboleth> same thing i tell people who get upset when having to deal with spectacularly difficult things like ip addresses, netmasks, MAC addresses: because some *really* smart people in the 80s made it like this
[02:14:56] <int0x1C8> right
[02:15:33] <int0x1C8> CableNinja, how does one configure it to traceroute on the same subnet then?
[02:15:55] <int0x1C8> because that's his goal
[02:16:15] <CableNinja> ...why
[02:16:17] <shibboleth> that's not how traceroute works though? it sends icmp with increasing ttl?
[02:16:18] <iphone> how do you not allow traceroute?

[02:17:53] <CableNinja> meh traceroutes not that fancy
[02:17:56] <shibboleth> iphone, you modify the packet headers to set ttl 1 for example
[02:18:10] <iphone> ooh das good
[02:18:53] <shibboleth> but, eh... this isn't how things work on the local subnet
[02:18:55] <CableNinja> int0x1C8,  shibboleth, anyway... on same subnet, with a proper config, traceroute works, even on same subnet
[02:19:09] <CableNinja> it will return a single hop
[02:19:23] <shibboleth> which isn't the "route"
[02:19:32] <CableNinja> of course not
[02:19:36] <CableNinja> well, it is,
[02:19:37] <shibboleth> just that the arbitrary ttl that traceroute set expired
[02:19:38] <CableNinja> but it isnt
[02:19:47] <shibboleth> at that hop
[02:19:52] <CableNinja> ...
[02:19:55] <shibboleth> which in this case happens to be the actual dest
[02:20:02] <CableNinja> it would respond with an error if it wasnt proper
[02:20:37] <CableNinja> on the same subnet, the default gateway is not used
[02:20:48] <CableNinja> so effectively, the target IP is the route
[02:20:49] <shibboleth> exactly

[02:20:58] <layer8> CableNinja meant: "so effectively, the target IP is the default gateway"
[02:20:58] <shibboleth> meaning there is no actual ttl handling
[02:21:06] <CableNinja> because there doesnt need to be
[02:21:36] <shibboleth> meaning traceroute isn't really the right tool for local subnet stuff
[02:21:52] <CableNinja> traceroute is rarely the right tool anyway

[09:36:15] <Work-BWMerlin> What am I looking at?
[09:38:27] <PrincessZoey> A dead Amazon robotics pod because it lost wifi
[09:41:23] <xe0n> if the certificate is signed (and trusted) by a root\intermediate cert that is already present in the store, you're good to go
[09:41:31] <xe0n> the mac is prob missing the intermediate\root certs for the cert
[09:41:36] <xe0n> which is why you are prompted to trust it since it cant
[09:41:52] <xe0n> i know i had to install those chain certs on macs when I managed them forever ago
[09:41:58] <xe0n> digicert especially
[09:42:24] <Work-BWMerlin> We currently have a profile that pushes the cert out, that cert is about to expire and a no-one has apparently been issued

[09:42:42] <xe0n> a profile on what?
[09:42:44] <xe0n> you're not making sense
[09:42:46] <xe0n> context missing...
[09:42:47] <Work-BWMerlin> Users are standard users on their device so I don't think they can trust a cert
[09:42:54] <xe0n> yes they can, the machine trusts it
[09:42:56] <Work-BWMerlin> MDM profile
[09:43:05] <xe0n> you shouldnt be prompted to trust a cert, if you are, it means the chain is incomplete
[09:43:15] <xe0n> if i deploy a cert, i dont wany any user interaction...
[09:43:38] <Work-BWMerlin> Yes, which is why the MDM profile pushes the cert down onto the users device so they don't get prompted to accept it
[09:43:44] <xe0n> excellent
[09:43:59] <xe0n> so the issue is due to expire? cool, go into the mdm config and see how it's been setup\apply a new cert?

[09:46:11] <xe0n> that'd be a starting point haha
[09:46:42] <Work-BWMerlin> Unfortunately like most things in BCE it is a "head office" thing
[09:46:57] <Work-BWMerlin> So while I have to make the profile and support it I can't get access to a lot of stuff
[09:47:18] <Work-BWMerlin> Also support is "ask a third part company"
[09:48:02] <Work-BWMerlin> They tie your hands up and then tell you to ask someone else to do the work you cannot do because they tied your hands
[09:51:34] <xe0n> hahaha
[09:51:43] <xe0n> well when it breaks, call head office :P
[09:55:59] <Work-BWMerlin> The "unhelpful" desk lives up to it's name
[09:56:19] <Work-BWMerlin> It was nice when I had all the control
[09:56:30] <Work-BWMerlin> Just go in and get the information I needed or make the change etc
[09:57:12] <Work-BWMerlin> Now there is a lot more leg work trying to figure out why things don't work only to realise that you don't have access to figure that part out

[13:12:09] <crustacean> teh_f4ll3n:  Hello darling
[13:12:13] <crustacean> Can you help us?
[13:12:22] <teh_f4ll3n> depends
[13:12:41] <teh_f4ll3n> if it's a reach-around you're looking for, ask rpifan
[13:12:58] <crustacean> A PERC H710 Mini with 2 drives in RAID0 configuration
[13:13:21] <crustacean> Someone janks both drives
[13:13:36] <CptLuxx> haha
[13:13:46] <crustacean> Now Disk Management shows 2 physical disk, 1 virtual disk
[13:13:54] <crustacean> The virtual disk is offline
[13:14:20] <crustacean> And the disk group has one disk online and one unconfigured disk
[13:14:34] <teh_f4ll3n> what's the raid controller saying?
[13:14:56] <teh_f4ll3n> if it's raid0, chances are you're fucked

[13:23:30] <nobyk> I don't think you can
[13:23:39] <nobyk> new group would mean new virtual drive right?
[13:23:46] <crustacean> Yep
[13:23:47] <nobyk> It will initialize a new virtual drive
[13:23:50] <nobyk> this will be empty

[13:23:56] <nobyk> Well I don't know
[13:23:58] <crustacean> You can skip it
[13:24:03] <nobyk> you can
[13:24:37] <crustacean> teh_f4ll3n: Imagine, you have a raid controller that does not allow JBOD and you want to use ZFS
[13:24:41] <crustacean> You have 6 drives
[13:24:46] <nobyk> he asks
[13:24:54] <crustacean> You make each one a raid 0
[13:25:00] <nobyk> but uh
[13:25:12] <crustacean> Passtru made easy my friend
[13:25:23] <nobyk> So there's a discover existing virtual drive config function or something like that?

[14:31:54] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> - Discovered boot was hung disk checking that storage drive
[14:31:54] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> - removed drive, booted from SSD to windows - disabled disk check for HDD
[14:31:54] <sd> 14<X​eLaD> - refitted drive, booted to windows, hard drive was on and visible as a drive - but couldnt access it
[14:32:04] <Activ8> your boss want's to hope to god there's no "other stuff" on there.  They do report such findings. lol

[14:35:05] <teh_f4ll3n> it might not be accessible because the file table's fucked

[21:43:53] <thegodsquirrel> I should have spend more time get good at that type of stuff when I was a young man
[21:43:56] <catbeard> and some lxml feature in bs4 to actually parse the url->loc links and strip the CDATA
[21:44:42] <catbeard> works on regular sitemaps, master sitemaps (ones that have multiple sitemaps stemming from /sitemap.xml)
[21:45:05] <catbeard> and it adds a hrefs (unique ones) that are linked to from every page to add to the discovery phase
[21:45:30] <catbeard> so it catches pages that aren't in the sitemap but are linked to by pages in the sitemap
[21:46:13] <thegodsquirrel> are you pumping that into something like maltego?
[21:46:16] <iphone> too smart for this channel

[22:58:04] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> just post the URL on 4chins and request LOIC.

[23:05:38] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so your also a teir 1 and they are?
[23:05:57] <onicrom> i am not, but we use a few tier 1 isps as our upstream

[23:08:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ah right sorry got the worng end of that
[23:09:30] <onicrom> we can do layer7 miitigation on our firewalls so long as they don't get saturated (decent palo alto models so can do an OK job)
[23:10:03] <onicrom> but at a straight layer4 level stuff that would just overwhelm us before the fw could do anything
