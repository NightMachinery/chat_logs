[07:49:45] <artao> weird how the mixer died too. started sounding REALLY gritty and lower volume

[08:57:03] <R2robot> ohhh
[08:57:13] <R2robot> it says "Midi Production Center"
[08:57:29] <R2robot> looks fancy

[08:59:33] <artao> samplers

[09:01:39] <artao> well ... more than a looper, and different
[09:02:17] <artao> it's commonly used to take one single drum loop sample off some album, then break that apart into the individual hits or smaller sections and assign them to each of the pads
[09:02:44] <artao> then play the pads to play those bits of the original drum loop -- a couple bars -- in whatever order you want
[09:02:46] <R2robot> SO MANY BUTTONS!
[09:03:18] <artao> perhaps. but ultimately it's pretty simple
[09:03:25] <artao> just overwhelming at first
[09:03:29] <R2robot> yeah
[09:03:40] <R2robot> you have one?
[09:03:51] *** Joins: toastloop (~toastloop@user/toastloop)
[09:04:16] <artao> the "buttons" are primarily the pads you assign the samples to

[09:04:54] <artao> arturia spark cdm ... hybrid drum machine/sampler
[09:05:10] <artao> the CDM is the hardware controller to interface with the software. it does nothing on it's own
[09:05:30] <artao> it has a line of 8 pads, each with 3 knobs (so you can adjust parameters of the sounds)
[09:05:50] <artao> many of those akai things are standalone. no computer needed

[09:23:37] <artao> Reaper is on Mac
[09:25:35] <R2robot> hmmm
[09:26:33] <artao> garageband is quite limited. but capable
[09:26:39] <artao> i've never used it, i'm PC
[09:26:51] <artao> but people quickly outgrow it. it's more of an "into to Logic"

[09:31:40] <R2robot> artao: it's ok if I outgrow it though.  At least I will have learned the basics :D
[09:31:47] <artao> yeah
[09:32:16] <sdragon> The MPC Live 2?
[09:32:18] <R2robot> i just want to create some simple background music for games
[09:32:22] <sdragon> No, it's expensive
[09:32:22] <artao> one thing about Reaper is that it doesn't have audio tracks and midi tracks and buss tracks and send tracks
[09:32:30] <artao> any track can be anything, even multiple at once
[09:32:35] <sdragon> Like $1300 new
[09:32:46] <artao> in garageband/logic, protools, ... pretty much everything else
[09:33:05] <artao> You have separate tracks for each of those. Just makes it a bit more ... complicated. IMO
[09:33:08] * sdragon uses LMMS
[09:33:25] <artao> but ... it's how things have always been done is studios. and DAWs are kinda emulating studios
[09:33:42] <R2robot> sdragon: I tried lmms a while back.  It kept crashing on me :(
[09:33:47] <artao> iirc LMMS has specific tracks too. instrument track vs. audio for instance
[09:34:11] <artao> i used it under linux. it's fun. works well
[09:34:44] <artao> i made this using LMMS

[09:35:08] <artao> last i tried it under windows tho, it couldn't use my ASIO driver and killed the audio on my system :(
[09:35:10] <sdragon> Yeah, LMMS isn't great for audio tracks, but it's still pretty useful
[09:35:52] <artao> yeah. it's essentially an FL Studio clone. very much electronic music focussed. pattern based rather than "clips" or audio loops
[09:35:59] <artao> definitely not meant for recording

[09:41:24] <sdragon> Thanks!
[09:41:34] <DunceCotus> im starting to think the only way im getting into making electronic music is if I write my own software to do it on
[09:41:36] <artao> not off the top of my head. it was a basic FM synth
[09:41:52] <artao> Not something i will EVER use again. it was hard to work with LOL
[09:42:05] <artao> i uninstalled it after the challenge even LOL

[12:43:27] <R2robot> I was browsing stuff on sweetwater and randomly adding things to my wishlist...  almost 30 thousand dollars worth. O.o

[12:45:25] <R2robot> mostly fantasy stuff.. nobody needs ALL that stuff :D
[12:45:36] <R2robot> but it's nice to day dream sometimes
[12:46:36] <artao> LOL
[12:46:38] <artao> i've done the same
[12:47:10] <artao> at one time it was well over 30 thousand ...... cuz they had the moog system 55 and system 15
[12:47:16] <artao> the system 55 was like 25 thousand
[12:47:34] <artao> the system 15 like 10k
[12:48:19] <R2robot> sheeeeeesh
[12:48:47] <artao> well .... they're huge. and hand made. and very limited run
[12:49:33] <artao> here's a system 55 for 35k

[12:51:50] <artao> that first picture has two sequencers (upper left and upper right)
[12:52:04] <artao> and is lacking the fixed filter bank
[12:52:39] <artao> and it only has 4 oscillators instead of 6
[12:52:40] <artao> wtf
[12:52:48] <artao> why are they listing this as a system 55 o.O
[12:55:10] <R2robot> what the fook do you even do with that thing?!
[12:55:32] <artao> make music
[12:56:00] <artao> it's not as complicated as it looks. honestly
[12:56:12] <R2robot> are you sure? it looks like a giant mainframe computer :D
[12:56:26] <R2robot> just needs some spinny tapes
[12:56:28] <artao> there's six oscillators in two banks of three .... those are all exactly the same .... two filters, both exactly the same
[12:56:50] <artao> the complicated with that one is that you have to wire bits together for it to do anything
[12:57:03] <R2robot> with patch cables?
[12:57:06] <artao> it's fully modular. bit of a learning curve, but it doesn't take long
[12:57:09] <artao> yep
[12:57:18] <R2robot> dang
[12:57:28] <R2robot> pretty cool
[12:57:34] <R2robot> nuts!  but cool
[12:57:45] <artao> at the most basic level you patch oscillator into a filter then out to the amplifier. and both the amplifier and filter cutoff are controlled by an envelope
[12:58:24] <artao> system 55 etc is just expanding the number of oscillators and filters and amps and envelopes ..... and yeah, adding a few other modules
