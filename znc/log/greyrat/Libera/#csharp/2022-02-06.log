[00:00:06] <GetShwifty> lmao
[00:02:08] <GetShwifty> but yeah io have no idea what made it a) choose to launch kestrel instead of iis express
[00:02:10] <GetShwifty> for new project
[00:02:19] <GetShwifty> or why it randomly switched 1 of 2 existing projects over just on a whim

[00:08:01] <GetShwifty> at least once i get it going back to using iis express
[00:08:17] <GetShwifty> but the only thing i changed in project #2 - is i reformatted and reordered a few properties  the

[00:10:55] <MatthiasVance> Hurray for progress
[00:10:55] <GetShwifty> that is progress
[00:10:59] <Guest3> lol
[00:11:50] <Guest3> although the sql connection works perfectly fine when i run it from visual studio but from IIS it cant connect
[00:13:03] <DoofusCanadensis> credentials?
[00:13:06] <MatthiasVance> Not surprised, different user
[00:13:10] <MatthiasVance> Also why do you use IIS?
[00:14:13] <Guest3> i am new to .net stuff... what alternative do i have i mean apart from IIS?
[00:14:29] <MatthiasVance> Guest3: What guide are you following? Are you at least on .NET 6?
[00:14:34] <GetShwifty> raw dog it bareback style
[00:14:34] <MatthiasVance> (guessing not)
[00:14:34] <GetShwifty> lmao
[00:14:35] <Guest3> yes
[00:14:37] <MatthiasVance> OH
[00:14:38] <Guest3> .net 6
[00:14:40] <MatthiasVance> That's good!
[00:14:48] <MatthiasVance> Did you perhaps mean IIS Express instead of IIS?
[00:14:59] <Guest3> no I am particularly working on https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb
[00:15:13] <Guest3> yes, sorry I mean IIS Express
[00:15:29] <DoofusCanadensis> a microsoft example? oh man, that'll never work
[00:15:40] <Guest3> hahahahahahahha
[00:15:50] <Guest3> bloody hell
[00:16:20] <MatthiasVance> What is the error you're getting?
[00:21:04] <Guest3> i think you are right something related to sql server connection permission

[00:22:41] <Guest3> i am using (localdb)\mssqllocaldb
[00:24:24] <Guest3> so basically the app is hosted on IIS and connects to (localdb)\mssqllocaldb
[00:25:20] <DoofusCanadensis> iis is probably running as a system account which that localdb doesn't trust
[00:26:00] <MatthiasVance> DoofusCanadensis: They are running IIS Express, not IIS
[00:26:22] <DoofusCanadensis> not the same at the system level?
[00:27:07] <Guest3> no i am at the same system level
[00:28:35] <MatthiasVance> DoofusCanadensis: Hm? No they are two different beasts
[00:28:41] <DoofusCanadensis> ah, okay
[00:28:48] <DoofusCanadensis> I'll keep out of this then
[00:59:52] <Guest3> somehow its working now

[01:17:58] <GetShwifty> well good news
[01:18:14] <GetShwifty> i somehow managed to get my 2 WebApi projects launching the way they were previously
[01:18:34] <GetShwifty> the 3rd one
[01:18:55] <GetShwifty> is not and is making everything unbuildable because it doesn't shut down properly/in time when rebuilding and it can't  copy it
[01:20:28] <GetShwifty> so the order of the json matters lol
[01:20:41] <GetShwifty> new projects flip iis express and the project name config around
[01:20:55] <GetShwifty> and i guess it assumes you are launching the first profile
[01:21:26] <GetShwifty> and i accidentally 'fucked' that cause generallyjson order of elements doesnt matter when i was trying to compare differences between the various launch settings and tried to 'standardize' them on one order
[01:27:15] <MatthiasVance> :D
[01:31:33] <GetShwifty> and i see ms now actually lets us specify domains in launch settings and lets it auto bind to non-local host ip without manually hacking  the applicationhost.config
[01:34:31] <Nasp> GetShwifty:  Web api as in framework?
[01:34:42] <GetShwifty> web api as in web api hosted projects
[01:34:53] <Nasp> So .NET framework?
[01:35:00] <GetShwifty> no
[01:35:21] <GetShwifty> what ms calls "ASP.NET Core Web API"
[01:39:43] <GetShwifty> oh
[01:40:10] <GetShwifty> ms finally got external source browser working / useful for people who didn't only ever use 100% nuget packages hosted only on git
[01:40:15] <MatthiasVance> Font rendering on Firefox is so weird
[01:40:39] <GetShwifty> meaning if you have 2 large solutions, one linkining to the other. you can now actually browser the source code of linked projects from the other one
[01:40:57] <GetShwifty> why that took so long to get working... no idea .. sadly i lost CodeLens in that preview that added that lol
[01:41:05] <GetShwifty> MatthiasVance:  under what situation?
[01:41:32] <GetShwifty> i know Firefox renders weirdly under Remote Desktop  on < (10/Server 2016?)
[01:42:16] <GetShwifty> i think in 3 years time it will be Chrome (Chromium), Edge (Chromium) and Firefox (Chromium)
[01:42:32] <GetShwifty> oh and Opera will try to make a comeback too so it will be Opera (Chromium)
[01:42:36] <GetShwifty> (again)
[01:42:47] <MatthiasVance> And on mobile all of the Chromiums will be Safaris
[01:42:47] <MatthiasVance> :D
[01:43:26] <GetShwifty> or at least on all the iOS it is
[01:43:37] <GetShwifty> i shocked my 100% iOS fanboi
[01:43:47] <GetShwifty> when i told him that he didn't actaully have a choice of browsers on iOS
[01:43:52] <GetShwifty> and he's like "Yes, i'm using Chrome"
[01:44:02] <GetShwifty> and i'm like no. That's WebKit/Safari branded as Chrome lol
[01:44:10] <MatthiasVance> You don't run iOS because you want .. choice right
[01:44:11] <GetShwifty> because apple bans anybody using any other web engine/browser than it
[01:44:43] <GetShwifty> gonna laugh in 5 years when most laptops are shipped with Windows 11 or Windows 12, they're all in +SX mode
[01:44:57] <GetShwifty> and ms reverts its ban restriction on any app using non-edge engines
[01:45:15] <DoofusCanadensis> heh
[01:45:16] <GetShwifty> and pluton enssures your computer is secure by only running MS approved software :D
[01:46:40] <DoofusCanadensis> wonder how that's going to play with IT's data protection software
[01:46:49] <GetShwifty> IT is gonna love it
[01:46:56] <GetShwifty> no more pesky leaks

[01:49:52] <GetShwifty> nope
[01:49:54] <GetShwifty> well
[01:50:00] <GetShwifty> it launched with intel 12
[01:50:06] <GetShwifty> so 12th generation intel has it baked in
[01:50:12] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, it won't hit our pipeline for a while
[01:50:14] <GetShwifty> and i forget if this last ryzen had it or not
[01:50:20] <GetShwifty> if not it will be in the next one
[01:50:30] <GetShwifty> but yeah depending upon where you are in the upgrade cycle
[01:50:38] <GetShwifty> but that's part of why Windows 11 required TPM ;)
[01:50:39] <DoofusCanadensis> we're already tracking at least six months behind our usual cycle
[01:51:03] <GetShwifty> get a lot more businesses/consumers to suddenly buy new chips which have a high probability of having pluton
[01:51:04] <DoofusCanadensis> and IT hasn't vetted win11 for release even if Updates is trying to convince us to click on that link
[01:51:18] <DoofusCanadensis> assuming the pipeline can handle that many purchases
[01:51:27] <GetShwifty> ms is selling windows 11 S Mode already
[01:51:28] <GetShwifty> lol
[01:52:01] <DoofusCanadensis> right now IT is telling us... we can give you five year old computers or you can wait six months or more for a new one

[18:12:44] <GetShwifty> lol
[18:13:07] <GetShwifty> its okay, i have a server that is still on 2012 r2 too

[18:16:03] <merced> but its more about the bonus i'm getting next month lmao

[18:30:02] <merced> what mock framework do people use these days
[18:30:24] <merced> moq still popular?
[18:31:02] <GetShwifty> i think so
[18:31:20] <GetShwifty> havent really seen a better / more touted alternative
[18:31:38] <GetShwifty> i've started using it a bit . its okay, it oculd be better, but the bet ter is more 'magical'
[18:32:44] <GetShwifty> i think the most annoying thing about it is
[18:33:12] <GetShwifty> you need the same 7 items mostly (but not quite setup) the same way to test multiple scenario paths
[18:33:28] <GetShwifty> and i don'treally know of a good way to do that cleanly without just basically c/p ing
[18:33:48] <GetShwifty> and everybody i see using moq more or less seems to basically do the same thing, just c/p
[18:35:28] <merced> totally not what i just did >_> <_<
[18:35:37] <GetShwifty> :-D

[18:37:03] <merced> nah that was 2008
[18:37:08] <merced> ask me how i know
[18:37:08] <GetShwifty> *cough*
[18:37:16] <GetShwifty> i need to go guys.

[18:37:58] <GetShwifty> my dirty secret is 2008 r2 :D
[18:38:35] <merced> hahahaha i feel your pain
[18:38:41] <merced> best part is, 2008 supported this cipher ;)
[18:38:45] <merced> and 2012 does not!
[18:38:48] <GetShwifty> lmao
[18:39:02] <merced> brb smoke
[18:39:04] <GetShwifty> k
[18:40:47] <MatthiasVance> HEH
[18:40:53] <MatthiasVance> merced: Is it an old cipher?
[18:41:33] <GetShwifty> generaly when you're having trouble with ciphers and not support its newer ciphers
[18:41:43] <GetShwifty> or the newer ellipticals/etc for the cipher
[18:42:00] <GetShwifty> had some super weirdness with .net core
[18:42:17] <GetShwifty> basically every upgraded version of .net core  lost more and more support for SSL on older versions of os
[18:42:38] <GetShwifty> to the point where had to completley disable ssl period and then use any other software that ran on the os , doing ssl that the os couydl do but .net core no longer coudl do
[18:43:10] <GetShwifty> seemed a situation where ms decided "we're going to support this os but you wont be able to do anything on it'
[18:43:18] <GetShwifty> and then just cranked it every time
[18:44:45] <merced> the even more annoying thing is, it works on my dev box and a fleet of 2008s
[18:44:52] <merced> but not on my prod 2012 box
[18:44:58] <GetShwifty> yep
[18:45:09] <GetShwifty> sll works fine in .net core on windows 7
[18:45:23] <GetShwifty> move the same app to server 2008 r2 which is cut from the same jib
[18:45:31] <GetShwifty> shits all over the place
[18:45:58] <GetShwifty> i just got tired of fighting with ms and disabled ssl and now everybody submits credit cards and all sorts of PCI over plain text
[18:46:02] <GetShwifty> jk
[18:46:21] <GetShwifty> i threw a proxy server in front that supports ssl fine  :D
[18:46:31] <merced> that _is_ what i'm thinking if bill gates tells me they cant fix it
[18:46:38] <GetShwifty> lol
[18:46:42] <merced> MatthiasVance: its not even that old of a cipher!
[18:47:00] <GetShwifty> a lot of the new ciphers are what cause problems (at least in .net core)
[18:47:12] <merced> oh?
[18:47:14] <GetShwifty> and its not even necessarily teh cipher but the elliptical (and some other technical jargon)
[18:47:19] <MatthiasVance> Oh fuck yet another person has replied to my reverse engineering blog post asking for part 2
[18:47:22] <merced> *takes notes*

[19:26:59] <GetShwifty> if EVERYTHING is not INotifyPropertyChanged
[19:27:24] <GetShwifty> so make Player INotifyPropertyChanged and make the propeties INotifyPropeties

[19:34:36] <GetShwifty> for more comlex properties  too
[19:34:53] <GetShwifty> but basically make all properties INotifyPropertyChanged - that generally solves 99% of problems
[19:35:16] <GetShwifty> its almost like the binding in most cases detects that its not got inotifypropertychanged in the property and just ignores binding it period
[19:37:11] <martin__--> hm must be something else added inpc and the behavior is still the same
[19:37:28] <ap5> nobody uses SpecFlow? it is really interesting. didn't know of it's existence before today. The Gherkin way of telling s story of the test quite suits me.
[19:38:16] <GetShwifty> lmao
[19:38:18] <GetShwifty> how much specflow cost
[19:38:23] <GetShwifty> first thing on their page "Used by Siemens"
[19:38:45] <ap5> I haven't actually looked at pricing :D
[19:39:13] <GetShwifty> tey're not doing a very convincing job at convincing a developer this makes their life easier
[19:40:15] <ap5> Well i haven't tried it yet so i can't say. Where do you see the pricing?
[19:40:21] <GetShwifty> i have no idea
[19:40:23] <GetShwifty> thats why i asked
[19:40:29] <GetShwifty> i just saw "Uszed by Siemens" as the first thing
[19:40:39] <GetShwifty> typically whenever i see that anything free automatically is +3500
[19:40:54] <GetShwifty> i'm really not sure what  problem they're trying to solve
[19:41:05] <ap5> Ah :)
[19:41:11] <GetShwifty> though honestly from the looks of it it doesn't seem like they replace moq - they're more trying to replace MSTest/XUnit ?
[19:41:27] <ap5> Well describing tests through Gherkin
[19:42:10] <ap5> No. Not replace. I see this as a tool you can use to describe your tests.
[19:42:33] <GetShwifty> okay you introduced the topic as if it was in reference to our discussion on Moq :-p
[19:43:06] <ap5> lol no :D i didn't know of any discussions of that
[19:43:11] <GetShwifty> ok
[19:43:36] <ap5> Moq and XUnit has it's place
[19:43:42] <GetShwifty> as a way to describe tests it seems interesting
[19:43:51] <ap5> Personally i use NSunstitute
[19:44:06] <GetShwifty> but imho gherkins realy is only valuable if you have a great way to report on it
[19:44:38] <GetShwifty> because nobopdy is going to remember the exact phrase to find a 1 test  amonst 800+
[19:44:41] <ap5> GetShwifty it gives some extra vocabulary for devs to describe a test so it is easier to understand
[19:44:56] <GetShwifty> i mean i use /// xmldoc for that
[19:45:00] <ap5> GetShwifty true
[19:45:11] <GetShwifty> so the true value comes in having  areally good way to report on everything
[19:45:26] <ap5> but xmldoc isn't the same
[19:46:05] <GetShwifty> (10:14:42 AM) ap5: GetShwifty it gives some extra vocabulary for devs to describe a test so it is easier to understand
[19:46:28] <GetShwifty> from that standpoint its actually better because if need be you can write a few sentences/small paragraphs and link to code/classes/methods
[19:47:04] <GetShwifty> but whgat xmldoc is NOT good at is reporting
[19:47:20] <GetShwifty> although if you really wanted to make a tool lol could prolly do stuff
[19:47:46] <ap5> xmldoc is documentuipn, Gherkin in SpecFlow is molding tests AND documention. Both have it's place.

[19:56:59] <jamea> GetShwifty yes
[19:57:07] <irwiss> depends if it's yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy/dd/mm ;)
[19:57:10] <GetShwifty> if that's what value Saturday is
[19:57:15] <GetShwifty> and also yeah what irwiss said too
[19:57:25] <GetShwifty> typicaly i only ever see a few random europeans use yyy/dd/mm
[19:57:25] <jamea> weekday of 2022/02/05   is 7?      asi si yyyy/mm/dd
[19:57:34] <GetShwifty> universal is yyyy-mm-dd

[19:57:51] <jamea> yyyy/mm/dd
[19:58:26] <GetShwifty> The DayOfWeek enumeration represents the day of the week in calendars that have seven days per week. The value of the constants in this enumeration ranges from Sunday to Saturday. If cast to an integer, its value ranges from zero (which indicates Sunday) to six (which indicates Saturday).\
[19:58:45] <GetShwifty> so to answer your question, probably no lol
[20:01:24] <jamea> excel tell me is 7
[20:01:41] <GetShwifty> Excel is not .NET lol
[20:01:58] <GetShwifty> this is C# - so if you ask a question without stating context we will assume you're referring to something related to C# / .net
[20:02:00] <jamea> GetShwifty understand but i need compare the result

[20:02:36] <jamea> i am developing in C# about get all data from last 6 FRIDAYS
[20:02:56] <GetShwifty> well if you go with Excel and use that value for .net you might be in for a saddies
[20:02:57] <GetShwifty> lol
[20:03:18] <GetShwifty> cause .NET goes by a 0 based-day  enumeration not a 1 based day enumeration
[20:03:40] <jamea> ok, understand, thanks
[20:10:17] <irwiss> the fun part will start when you'll be porting the app to places where week doesn't end on friday ;p
[20:13:50] <GetShwifty> :-D
[20:14:09] <GetShwifty> i think that's where being very DRY/SOLID prolly helps out

[23:38:07] <lz_> BtbN: that's why i need a new pc, to share the gpu
[23:38:20] <BtbN> You can't sensibly share a GPU between host and a VM
[23:38:29] <BtbN> You need two GPUs in the machine
[23:39:43] <lz_> BtbN: yes now you can with discrete device assignment, but you need a recent enough mobo (and it still needs to split the memory etc)
[23:40:21] <lz_> needs some messing with the vm drivers too :( I wish they didn't remove remotefx from hyperv

[23:55:54] <MichaelLong> I'm using a USB-audio adapter for stereo the headphone, I assume there are one for 5.1
[23:56:30] <lz_> MichaelLong: but what if you want to use your usb soundcard on the guest AND listen to music on the host while having a zoom call at the same time
[23:56:41] <MichaelLong> other solution might bit virto-snd but I've not found much documentation on that - until know it must be mostly used in automotive
[23:56:49] <MichaelLong> *now
[23:56:56] <BtbN> stereo is usually not too big of an issue, if you're fine with some delay
[23:57:06] <BtbN> But I found anything with more than two channels to be outright impossible.
[23:57:40] <BtbN> A USB soundcard would probably work, but you need to PCIe passthrough a USB controller for USB to work reliably in VMs as well
[23:57:48] <BtbN> Just too much pain any tedium to be worth the effort
[23:57:51] <BtbN> *and
[23:58:42] <lz_> BtbN: I admit that last time I tried to use a usb gamepad with vmware I had to do some weird shit in the cnofig
[23:58:48] <MichaelLong> I've optimised this quite much. cgroups + cset, dynamic thread pinning, etc. I'm doing mostly battlefield 5, assetto corsa and Flightsim 2020 (the last ones with VR) without any issues
[23:59:14] <BtbN> lz_, I've messed with that shit _a lot_ the only way I found to get reliable "USB passthrough" is to give the VM an entire controller
[23:59:42] <MichaelLong> yeah did that. since the beginning. now I'm passing the usb-controller of the GPU
[23:59:45] <BtbN> At some point I concluded that I'd basically be forced to install an entire second PC into my PC
[23:59:56] <MichaelLong> that's the point.
