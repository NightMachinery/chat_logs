[02:04:47] <Activ8> no way did anybody know this 
[02:06:15] <Activ8> if you go to your github repo and then in the url bar in front of your url vscode.dev/ it opens up in vscode in browser for your repo?
[02:07:31] <Activ8> for example - https://vscode.dev/github/thelounge/thelounge
[02:07:51] <MaxLeiter> aye, new feature
[02:07:55] <MaxLeiter> you can also hit . on a github page 
[02:08:04] <Activ8> nice! I just read up on that
[02:08:18] <MaxLeiter> im most excited for being able to have multiple codespaces (one per branch)
[02:08:22] <MaxLeiter> people could test PRs in browser 
[02:08:44] <Activ8> holy crap that's just opened up a whole new world for devs
[02:08:53] <Activ8> no need for local software any more
[02:08:58] <Activ8> well ish
[02:09:43] <MaxLeiter> eh, local will still be preferred by many, but it is nice for sure 
[02:10:09] <MaxLeiter> and it will be a long time, if ever, that vscode web can compete with certain tasks on a desktop 
[02:10:19] <Activ8> not if your an ipad coder or a device where you can't really install local apps
[02:10:27] <Activ8> for desktops yeh 
[02:10:28] <MaxLeiter> heh, https://maxleiter.com/X11 :P 
[02:10:30] <MaxLeiter> figured that one out
[02:10:52] <Activ8> wow man
[02:10:54] <Activ8> awesome
[02:12:19] <Activ8> hold on, your the creator of x11?
[02:12:27] <Activ8> your - you're
[02:12:42] <MaxLeiter> no, i just got it working on iOS 
[02:13:31] <MaxLeiter> all the people who made X11 are probably >50 years old, at this point 
[02:13:33] <MaxLeiter> >60, even
[02:14:42] <Activ8> maybe you might get a call one day from em
[02:15:33] <MaxLeiter> most of the world is moving to wayland, so I doubt it lol
[02:16:55] <Activ8> you never know
[02:20:24] <johncs> ahaha that's absurdity
[02:20:26] <johncs> well done, that's really cool
[02:22:42] <johncs> was looking at Krita the other day, wondering what kind of effort it would take to get it to run on webassembly
[02:22:52] <johncs> Concluded: just so much
[02:23:43] <johncs> Would be rad to have a painting tool like that available as a web app though.
[02:24:10] <MaxLeiter> iirc adobe just released a web version of photoshop
[02:24:18] <MaxLeiter> so im sure a foss option will be out in next ~10 years :D
[02:25:11] <MaxLeiter> kinda old but seemingly always relevant: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript
[02:26:05] <johncs> haha I hope so. I feel like Krita would be the obvious choice, they already have a bunch of targets and Qt supports web assembly, so I think they're in a position to at least approach the problem
[02:26:23] <johncs> Ah man I think I remember watching that forever ago

[02:29:44] <MaxLeiter> 2014 and really not that far off lol
[02:29:59] <johncs> ahahaha it's the dream
[03:27:09] <MaxLeiter> johncs: are you still on ios 14? 
[03:27:09] <MaxLeiter>  https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/82bb00020b27bd23/6B49CC34-A035-4243-A920-EBE1F4B70D98.png 
[03:27:30] <MaxLeiter> I just upgraded my TL and ios but im assuming this is caused by ios 15
[03:36:14] <bookworm> !boring
[03:36:15] <wendy> bookworm: booooooring, take that nonsense to #thelounge
[03:36:22] <bookworm> ;P

[05:44:13] <johncs> there's something mildly mind blowing about an OS update
[05:44:37] <johncs> like there's something weird about the fact that it's updating itself. feels like it shouldn't be able to do that. like it needs a super OS to be doing it.
[05:44:51] <johncs> though I guess that is kinda what's happening... it's not like the OS isn't in an environment
[05:46:18] <johncs> somewhat relatedly, a sysadmin friend of mine decided to see what happened if he took a machine and just started zeroing out its hard drive while it was running
[05:46:24] <johncs> lasted a surprisingly long time üòÜ
[05:50:35] <MaxLeiter> Thats a big reason I like linux. Updating the kernel while its running feels wild

[13:31:04] <bookworm> url bar at the bottom is a design mistake
[13:31:55] <bookworm> in 100% of the cases you move the page up, aka scroll down. Having a bar on top makes the hiding seemless, the bottom not so much
[13:32:35] <Activ8> I haven't even tested TL running with the safari bar at the bottom, I reverted back to the top but I use a PWA anyway

[20:55:18] <MaxLeiter> I actually like the address bar at the bottom as a user 
[20:55:21] <MaxLeiter> as a dev less so
[20:55:34] <MaxLeiter> but i think in a year it will be something i couldnt live without
[21:14:40] <bookworm> really?
[21:14:52] <bookworm> what do you prefer about it?
[21:15:16] <MaxLeiter> near my thumb
[21:15:37] <MaxLeiter> one handed browsing got far far easier
[21:16:03] <MaxLeiter> you can also swipe on it to switch between tabs, but that could've been implemented without the change (its just nice)
[21:23:36] <xnaas> I like the idea in principle
[21:23:41] <xnaas> but absolutely despise it in practice
[21:24:15] <xnaas> I should like that it's closer to my thumb, but instead I'm just clicking shit at the top of the screen and navigating to random shit I didn't want to, because the address bar isn't there... üòÖ
[21:24:35] <xnaas> habit op
