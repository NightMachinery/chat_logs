[02:12:41] <Khepra> gh555222: I don't know of any, but in general, software that has "LTS" concepts, "Stable" branches that can survive for years with nothing but bug and security fixes are well suitable for Stable
[02:13:24] <gh555222> ok, and then for the actual process of submitting packages, what do other people typically do to get packages included?
[02:13:31] <Khepra> then again there's the whole world of snaps and flatpaks for vendors that dont' bother with LTS concepts and want controlled, isolated releases

[02:25:42] <sney> those sbc images are often more stock than they used to be, but kernel weirdness is 100% on the vendor
[02:25:48] <HiHoGo> yet if i have installed exfatprogs i would think that it would be found in the moduals directory after installing
[02:25:55] <sney> no,
[02:26:07] <xx> exfatprogs package does not contain the kernel module
[02:26:14] <sney> the module is the kernel driver. exfatprogs is the utilities to handle it
[02:26:22] <HiHoGo> xx nobody gave me it. i got it from git hub. your right its annoying
[02:26:22] <Khepra> HiHoGo: the exfat module is normally packaged by linux-image-<version> debian packages. you seem to be running some derivative
[02:26:25] <Khepra> !based on debian

[02:26:34] <sney> kernel support needs to exist for the rest to work. that's true of fuse, too. I bet this vendor also skipped that one

[02:27:14] <HiHoGo> Khepra, this is a debian bullseye image made for my sbc like a raspberry PI its a standard arm build as far as i know.
[02:27:18] <xx> easy to install normal debian on it too

[02:27:46] <Khepra> xx: no I mean they discontinued the line
[02:27:48] <HiHoGo> xx, no i dont think so its a specific sbc an old odroid U3
[02:27:48] <sney> HiHoGo: it has a nonstandard kernel. you are having kernel driver problems. even if the rest is pure debian, you still need to talk to the vendor about their custom kernel and its issues.
[02:28:17] <Khepra> HiHoGo: it's not, it's a derivative based on bullseye. this is not bullseye proper and thus not supportable here.
[02:28:36] <HiHoGo> oh ok i get that now. so its the modified kernel needed to boot on my U# SBC i see
[02:28:37] <sney> if this had a debian kernel, you wouldn't have even joined this channel
[02:28:53] <sney> it would have just worked
[02:28:56] <Khepra> indeed
[02:28:59] <Aarch64debian> is debian aarch 64 based on debian 10??
[02:29:12] <Khepra> it's your nick. you should know!
[02:29:13] <jelly> HiHoGo, made for your sbc by WHOM?
[02:29:13] <sney> Aarch64debian: aarch 64 is a cpu architecture. so that depends
[02:29:17] <HiHoGo> ok well i dont know how to contact the dev or get support because github is not a forum as such.
[02:29:40] <xx> HiHoGo: use the issues for that, devs love seeing questions as issues ;)
[02:29:45] <Aarch64debian> in raspi.debian.net
[02:29:51] <jelly> the userspace might be 100% bullseye; but the kernel is unusual
[02:30:05] <Khepra> xx: I can see the invisible, but present, quotes around "love" :)
[02:30:08] <jelly> HiHoGo, open an issue.
[02:30:18] <sney> Aarch64debian: the second column on the downloads page, "release", says which debian version it is
[02:30:28] <HiHoGo> jelly, i looked around github and cant work out how to do that
[02:30:35] <Khepra> MEANWHILE  maybe try installing debian's kernel package? can that even boot on that thingy
[02:30:35] <HiHoGo> will try again
[02:30:41] <jelly> HiHoGo, well wher exactly did you find it?
[02:31:36] <sney> usually there is some proprietary bootloader shenanigans behind the existence of those custom kernels. but maybe it's no longer needed, could be worth a try (but take a backup)
[02:32:33] <Khepra> well if the userland is regular debian then grub hooks should co-install the kernel, and it should be selectable on boot. definitely make backups, yes; I'm just sayying it needn't be catastrophic, if debian userland is in question
[02:33:21] <jelly> which arm sbc did you ever see grub working on
[02:33:27] <Aarch64debian> it says wireless not working :(
[02:33:40] <jelly> it would need to have proper uefi fw for that
[02:33:59] <xx> Khepra: there definitely is no grub on my odroid
[02:34:09] <jelly> most tiny sbcs use u-boot or worse
[02:34:38] <xx> yeah, yeah, u-boot here
[02:34:50] <xx> not sure why I had yeah twice there
[02:35:00] <jelly> sure sure
[02:35:15] <xx> probably a brain bug, they really ought to fix that by now
[02:35:37] <sney> Aarch64debian: yeah, fun with broadcom it seems https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=999485 - you could discuss in #debian-raspberrypi on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera) to see if there's any progress on that

[07:50:44] <rockworld> any idea on cheaper alternative then cpanel
[07:52:10] <gry> ask #linux
[07:52:35] <relipse> I added a subdomain to my dns with linode, but it still doesn't work, why not?
[07:52:47] <somiaj> !free whcp
[07:52:47] <dpkg> FOSS Web Hosting Control Panels include: <DTC>, <GNUPanel>, <ISPConfig> and <ispCP> Omega.  Don't use <Webmin>.  http://wiki.debian.org/HostingControlPanels
[07:52:57] <somiaj> rockworld: ^^ maybe check some of those
[07:53:54] <sney> relipse: dns changes take time to be available across the internet. check the output of 'host your.sub.domain' on the client machine you're testing from
[07:54:15] <rockworld> somiaj: thank you :)
[07:54:32] <relipse>  not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
[07:54:33] <somiaj> relipse: dns can sometimes be locally cached and take a while to update. You can use dig to check out the linnode dns directly to see if it is setup
[07:55:56] <sney> the TTL set on the linode control panel (if they show that) will also give you some idea of how quickly it'll propagate

[08:02:24] <sney> if your other one isn't a wildcard, yes
[08:02:45] <sney> if you're using certbot just run it again, it'll ask you to set up the subdomain
[08:02:59] <relipse> i was using letsencrypt?
[08:03:12] <sney> certbot is the most common tool for letsencrypt, last I checked
[08:03:23] <relipse> just type in certbot ?
[08:04:05] <sney> if you are currently using certbot to manage the ssl certs on your server, you should already know this
[08:04:19] <sney> if you did something else to set up your ssl certificates, you'll need to do that instead. only you know what you are doing
[08:04:52] <relipse> i'm  a programmer i only do the cert stuff once a year
[08:05:41] <sney> then check your notes.
[08:06:26] <relipse> yep it was certbot

[13:35:30] <Khepra> sftp command line is a terrible interface
[13:36:30] <Khepra> Why does Ctrl-C completely hang the client. it hangs it so much, it doesn't even die when you kill the parent process
[13:37:04] <jelly> sshfs is an okay client.
[13:37:31] <jelly> esp. with -o reconnect
[13:38:06] <Khepra> seems a bit of too fiddly overkill when all I need is a quick sftp login, cd to where I want, and "put" a file
[13:38:29] <jelly> lftp also does sftp
[13:38:53] <Khepra> tab autocomplete, but you select the wrong file and backspace doesn't work. you try ctrl-c and the entire piece of garbage hangs so you have to kill-nine it

[15:22:50] <isf> Official Linux kernel of Debian are cleaned of nonfree software,
[15:22:52] <Khepra> also, "deblobbing" implies no drivers that might require nonfree firmware. debian kernels contain drivers that require nonfree firmware

[15:25:27] <isf> im not running nonfree software in my kernel
[15:25:30] <Khepra> linux-image-amd64 for example (and the versioned deps) all do come with modules that may require nonfree firmware. realtek, amdgpu, broadcom, iwl, ...
[15:25:31] <isf> becouse are cleaned of firmware.
[15:25:40] <PerfDave> Firmware doesn't run in the kernel
[15:25:46] <Khepra> so if you run a kernel without those, you're not running "official" debian kernel
[15:26:16] <Khepra> PerfDave: I'm talking about fsf guidelines for deblobbing which specify one must not run drivers that require such firmware
[15:26:38] <PerfDave> In the "old days" the non-free firmware just lived on a ROM on the device itself; "loadable firmware" just saves putting an extra IC on the device by squirting the firmware over the PCI/USB bus to the device every boot. It actually makes it easier to replace firmware with free firmware because you don't need soldering skills to do it (see the Atheros drivers etc.)
[15:26:39] <Khepra> even if the driver itself is "free"-ly part of mainline. even if it's GPL'd
[15:26:56] <isf> im without nonfree drivers, or nonfree firmware or blobs.

[15:32:25] <isf> In accordance with Debian's core principles, those codified in The Debian Social Contract, the default Debian install is configured to install only Free Software. Non-free software is made available to those who wish to risk its ills. Before blindly installing non-free software it may be prudent to ask if there is a Free replacement.
[15:33:01] <pingpongball> isf wrong, debian ships *snapd* package even if you havent enabled non free software in sources.list
[15:33:14] <Khepra> right. and amdgpu is Free software, per those guideliness. it just requires non-free firmware.

[17:15:39] <Khepra> dokma: a br0 (for example, arbitrary naming) iface that has your eth0 (or what's your main physical iface) and, say, a VM tap, as members
[17:16:10] <pagu> there are a few nwtowrk types and you need the bridge one , dokma

[17:18:56] <jelly> dokma, if you have static or dhcp config for eth0.  you'll have to unconfigure that, and put the same config for br0 with eth0 as a member device

[19:04:09] <Khepra> pingpongball: didn't you just do that
[19:04:25] <Khepra> but booting into the new kernel, you have "black screen"?
[19:04:32] <pingpongball> yes i did `sudo apt -t bullseye-backports remove linux-image-5.14.0-0.bpo.2-amd64`
[19:04:37] <pingpongball> yes true, black screen
[19:04:42] <pingpongball> then came back to 5.10
[19:04:43] <Khepra> so the question is wrong, then. you DID change the kernel, and now you have a NEW problem.
[19:05:12] <pingpongball> no i think my command was wrong, i should go through that what dpkg told
[19:05:14] <Khepra> pingpongball: remove "quiet" from the grub config's kernel's cmdline and reboot, see if it spits out any errors
[19:05:51] <pingpongball> what was that command of dpkg  gave to install new kernel please show me
[19:05:55] <Khepra> you can also temporarily edit grub options from the menu, if you hit E and edit the entry's "linux /vmlinuz...." line
[19:06:12] <Khepra> pingpongball: which one, bullseye backports kernel?
[19:06:17] <pingpongball> yes bullseye
[19:06:33] <Khepra> pingpongball: bullseye or bullseye-backports
[19:06:42] <pingpongball> bullseye-backports
[19:06:59] <pingpongball> !bullseye-backports-kernel
[19:07:12] <Khepra> apt install -t bullseye-backports linux-image-amd64 linux-headers-amd64
[19:07:23] *** Joins: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539)
[19:07:26] <pingpongball> but that was not command that it previously gave
[19:08:04] <Khepra> you asked for a command to install the kernel from backports. that's it
[19:08:27] <pingpongball> what version of that is `linux-image-amd64 linux-headers-amd64` ? kernel version
[19:08:33] <Khepra> that will implicitly pull in the VERSIONED package for correct, bullseye-backports kernel, which is 5.14.0-0.bpo.2  at the moment
[19:08:59] <pingpongball> oh ok ,
[19:09:24] <pingpongball> khepra , i've also nvidia drivers, do i've to do something more
[19:09:52] <Khepra> pingpongball: it should trigger DKMS rebuild of the drivers. HOWEVER.... which version of nvidia drivers? not all support the 5.14 kernel

[19:11:04] <Khepra> pingpongball: which driver package are you using.
[19:11:16] <pingpongball> `nvidia-driver`
[19:11:40] <Khepra> okay, so not one of those older legacy things. then nvidia should rebuild via dkms triggers as you reinstall BOTH the kernel and the headers
[19:12:12] <Khepra> make sure you remove "quiet" from the cmdline in /etc/default/grub, so you can see any errors it spits out during boot

[21:43:01] <jmd> anyway freedesktop does indeed seem to have docs, but hardly tutorials.
[21:44:18] <han-solo> one just copy a service file and add random After and Wants to it until it works ;)
[21:44:28] <sney> so you go to something like this, and scroll to the bottom part where it says "examples" https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html
[21:44:32] <han-solo> ExecStart, RestartSec etc too
[21:44:32] <somiaj> Just like with many things systemd takes a bit to get use to, but I found I picked it up quickly. Looking for examples of a unit file is good too. I find the official docs on freedesktop.org decent, once you know what you are looking for.

[21:45:53] <han-solo> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd # seems informational
[21:46:10] <jkc> You could also start with "man systemd"
[21:46:33] <jmd> jkc: Typically, man pages are also not tutorials.
[21:47:19] <sney> if you know a trustworthy tutorial site that you like, that can explain this to you, there's nothing wrong with that;
[21:47:46] <sney> but a lot of the time those high ranked step by step sites have some questionable advice and outdated cargo cult stuff
[21:48:00] <sney> the examples section in an official doc won't, and gives you a bunch of stuff to start from
[21:49:44] <jkc> The number of tutorials written by people who don't know what the fsck they're doing is astonishing.
[21:50:23] <jmd> That is true.  But usually those are easy to discern.
[21:50:26] <jkc> The systemd manpage collection is incredibly detailed, very well explained, and have a lot of examples.

[21:50:54] <jkc> jmd: That's a provably false statement. People in need of tutorials lack the requisite understanding of the material to discern whether the tutorial is good or bad.

[22:54:00] <rustyy> hey guys, i want to add a pkg to an official debian repo and maintain it, could you please point me to a correct guide/docs, i cannot seem to find the steps for the procedure..
[22:55:00] <sney> !nmg
[22:55:01] <dpkg> The packaging tutorial (https://deb.li/QYyI) and the New Maintainer's Guide (https://deb.li/3DiDA) are good places to start learning about Debian packaging.  You should also ask me about <devref> and <policy> to understand how packages should be maintained and how they should interact with each other.  Ask me about <package basics>, <mentors>, <best practices> <build without helper>.  https://www.debian.org/devel/
[22:55:19] <sney> also ask in #debian-mentors on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera) - but first try to read the tutorial at least
