[13:18:20] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> that's literally it.
[13:18:49] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> But as an example, in the 40s-ish, the "Commerce Clause" was reinterpreted in such a way that effectively allows the government to blanket ban anything.
[13:18:59] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> "You may not do [X] in a manner that affects interstate commerce."
[13:19:08] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> That, in essence, bans X.
[13:19:18] <sd> 02<r​yalln> That is fucked
[13:19:53] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Some guy was growing wheat for his livestock, during a period where farmers were limited on how much wheat they could grow. He was found guilty of committing a crime due to interstate commerce laws, despite never giving the wheat to anyone else.
[13:19:59] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Because by growing wheat, you are not buying it from the market.
[13:20:05] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> By not buying it from the market, you're affecting interstate commerce.

[13:20:33] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> A huge number of laws are now based on interstate commerce, like 99% of gun laws in the US.
[13:20:49] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> So any attempts to remove that shitty, obviously not proper interpretation basically topples 70 years of laws in the country.
[13:21:20] <sd> 07<x​oxo> surely the supreme court should be ruling on that
[13:21:34] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @JaggedCrane They did, that's how it became a thnig in the first place.

[13:22:04] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> What the Supreme Court agrees is constitutional, and what is obvious, are two completely separate things.

[13:22:37] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> no.
[13:23:07] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> If the action you have taken affects interstate markets/commerce, or was done with items obtained via such routes, it's potentially a no-no if it's something that the feds want regulated
[13:23:11] <sd> 07<x​oxo> isn't the supreme courts job to clarify the intentions of laws
[13:23:26] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> wat
[13:24:00] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> no, the Supreme Court's job is to do whatever bullshit is on the agenda at the given time based solely on the opinions of the judges there
[13:24:10] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> which has been chugging along for a decent time now.
[13:27:54] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @ryalln Machine guns, for example, are regulated under interstate commerce laws in the US under the NFA. There ARE some... "untested" statutes in some states that say "if the item was built in this state, and has not left the state, it's legal and we will not aid federal authorities, and any federal authorities who attempt to do anything about it are committing a crime", but again, untested. https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2010/HB0095
[13:28:32] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Texas just made their own (only for silencers, not machine guns), I think about 10 states have such statutes now. Texas is the next big jump, since they're... well, Texas, so it'll probably actually get tested now.

[13:32:04] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> or it could all be perfectly legal!
[13:32:22] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> All depends on if they even want to test your case at the Supreme or District courts, and what judges you get.
[13:32:49] <sd> 02<r​yalln> dude, Ive done family court in Australia. that was bad enough
[13:33:01] <sd> 02<r​yalln> judge can ruin your life if they are having a bad day
[13:33:57] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @ryalln Fun thing, in regards to the "gray" bit:
[13:33:57] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> in the US, the only regulated individual part of a firearm is the receiver (or frame for handguns or similar). Well, the receiver is TRADITIONALLY defined as this: "the item which contains the fire control group, bolt, and hammer".
[13:34:15] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> On an AR-15, and many other modern firearms, the gun is split into two separate pieces... one of which contains 2/3 of those parts, and one of which contains 1/3 of those parts.
[13:34:22] <sd> 07<x​oxo> when would you ever need a machine gun for personal use
[13:34:35] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Depending on interpretation, an AR-15 could be completely unregulated if stripped down to single parts.
[13:34:46] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> And several court cases have been thrown out due to this, of people selling the "regulated" parts.
[13:35:21] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Because they're afraid that, if it does get to a large court, it could potentially deregulate a lot of modern guns in parts, or the entire, country until new laws are passed.
[13:35:36] <sd> 06<A​da> american gun laws are insane
[13:35:44] <sd> 06<A​da> actually just american laws in general
[13:35:50] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @JaggedCrane I'd rather have the option to go full auto if I could.
[13:35:52] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> No reason _not_ to have it.
[13:36:04] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Only reason my AR-15 isn't full auto is because it's illegal. I could turn it full auto in like, 45 seconds.
[13:36:10] <sd> 02<r​yalln> like your previous comment, buying something could be jail or no issue. Kinda like weeek. People in jail while people out selling it

[13:36:46] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ar-15 isnt a machine gun
[13:36:48] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Weed is another example of people thinking the feds are overstepping, and states deregulating it. It's still illegal federally, but state law officers aren't allowed to enforce those laws, or aid federal officers in enforcement.
[13:36:52] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @Hotness I'm talking about machine guns here.
[13:37:13] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Started with how a lot of US laws are based off of interstate commerce, mentioned the NFA.

[13:39:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the issue is there is no requirement for the legislatures to draft consitional laws
[13:39:38] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> I'm well aware lol.
[13:39:49] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> It's silly.
[13:39:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so your in a case where you have to have someone with standing to bring a case to the courts before they get struck down
[13:40:27] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> I ultimately think it's all a big charade that can fall apart at any time if enough people just say "yeah nah I'm going to bed, none of this means anything"

[16:44:00] <riff-IRC> oh ok
[16:44:30] <riff-IRC> if you're curious, about 85% of our generator control systems were based around industrial 80486s
[16:44:46] <riff-IRC> we also had the 80487 copro installed
[16:46:22] <riff-IRC> the system design was in-house and 100% custom
[16:48:05] <riff-IRC> we had everything from our small single-generator controllers that didn't support multi-line synchronization - those usually had about 5 EISA slots- one for the I/O card, 2 for the triple-channel oscilloscope cards, and an open slot for future expansion or debug purposes
[16:49:10] <riff-IRC> all the way up to massive control computers that had as many as 15 or even 20 EISA slots, most of them populated with I/O cards and oscilloscope cards
[16:53:40] <riff-IRC> there were some accessory cards, too, such as a multi-monitor VGA card, as well as high-speed InterLink II cards for communications with other control systems, in addition to a high-speed sidebus card that allowed the operation of a secondary bus on the oscilloscope cards that had data speeds of up to 1300MB/s
[16:56:17] <riff-IRC> We could easily get reliable bus operation on 15 EISA slots, but we had a heck of a time getting a 20-slot system running reliably
[16:58:07] <riff-IRC> getting the signal timing right was the hardest part- we had to raise the bus clock speed when a device installed on slots 16-20 asserted the bus, which was all kinds of fun when a bus multiplexer bugged out and left 2 or more cards' data lines connected to the CPU
[16:58:34] <riff-IRC> BAM, interrupt storm, system crash, or CPU lockup.
[17:01:28] <sd> 13<C​olour> =o
[17:02:34] <riff-IRC> We released our 15-slot controller systems in 1991. The 20-slot systems were released in 1995.
[17:02:56] <riff-IRC> 4 extra years getting bus signal timing correct.
[17:05:44] <riff-IRC> IIRC, a 15-slot base package (80486+80487, 8MB FPM, no HDD, base VGA) ran you about $45K.
[17:06:32] <riff-IRC> A comparable 20-slot base package (80486+80487, 8MB EDO, no HDD, base VGA) ran you about $82-85K.
