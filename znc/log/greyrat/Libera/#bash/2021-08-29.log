[04:26:41] <osse> true
[04:28:19] <a_train[m]> say, wouldn't bash be better off if it was implemented in rust? Just as an experiment thought. I know that there must be tons of legacy behaviors (even bugs as features) that makes it unfeasible to officially move over to rust in the official bash code base... not to mention all the work that has been done already.
[04:28:37] <a_train[m]> it would be more maintainable, have fewer bugs and and be more secure.

[04:38:08] <kurahaupo> a_train[m]: Rust isn't the only "secure" language. After a certain point, the C bugs have been beaten out, and there's more risk of introducing bugs by rewriting than by staying
[04:38:36] <a_train[m]> that's a good argument
[04:38:42] <shimbles> our rust is now self-hosted, which means the underlying steel is all gone and there is no longer a stable foundation. in other words, we have put a house of cards into production

[04:39:02] <a_train[m]> kurashaupo, well, bash is pretty old now so it's quite some good software.

[04:39:34] <a_train[m]> is shimbles a bot btw? looks like a markov chain?
[04:40:03] <shimbles> yes, we are now self-hosting bash as pure syntactic sugar with libglucometer

[04:42:48] <a_train[m]> kurahaupo. The latest serious bug (I forgot its name.. it could let you escalate to root) was a simple buffer overflow. Those are quite hard to do by mistake on modern c++ and especially rust.
[04:42:57] <osse> ca 115 years
[04:43:34] <a_train[m]> C's time has passed. :/. We've come so far. But I like its simplicity when it comes to hardware coding.. tiny chips with kilobytes of memory etc.

[04:53:18] <skered> I have an idea what it might be.
[04:53:48] <kurahaupo> C99 was a missed opportunity to take the language forward. I put up a proposal to split the integer types into "hardware" and "semantic" subsets, leaving the old legacy typenames in "hardware" and giving new names & new behaviour that had much tighter constraints. However I didn't have enough spare time to build a working compiler
[04:55:30] <skered> osse: Ok.  It seems to default to sh syntax if it can't guess.

[14:30:38] *** Joins: bidouille (~user_name@trois.potager.org)
[14:30:49] <emanuele6> i don't think you can bind \C-z to something in bash

[14:32:08] *** Joins: shabius (~shabius@2a0e:1c80:2:1021::1001)
[14:32:22] <emanuele6> that's how you bind a shell command to a key combination

[14:33:01] <emanuele6> it will work

[14:33:30] <herjazz> *giving
[14:33:37] <emanuele6> but to make it work with \C-z, you will have to figure out how to make bash get \C-z

[14:36:43] <herjazz> but I'll try c-g
[14:36:53] <emanuele6> what did you try? i don't really think i understand. did you try opening vim, pressing \C-z and then pressing \C-g as bound by bind -x '"\C-g":fg'?

[14:38:36] <herjazz> c-z doesn't 
[14:38:41] <emanuele6> right
[14:38:48] <emanuele6> that's because bash can't see \C-z
[14:39:09] <emanuele6> \C-z is not handled by bash and is not a `bind' binding
[14:39:21] <herjazz> just some ppl online (including romainl of vim fame) *have* gotten c-z to work somehow
[14:39:32] <herjazz> but maybe due to their terminal settings
[14:39:41] <emanuele6> yeah, probably
[14:39:59] <emanuele6> maybe he rebound \C-z to another key that he bound to fg with `bind'
[14:40:03] <emanuele6> or something like that
[14:40:12] <emanuele6> from his terminal settings
[14:40:33] <herjazz> it seems easier to do in zsh but I don't use it

[14:41:25] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[14:42:18] <emanuele6> i think i found a workaround

[14:42:30] <emanuele6> that seems to work
[14:42:57] <emanuele6> TSTP is the signal sent by \C-z; and you make bash handle it by running `fg'
[14:43:07] <emanuele6> it should be time afaict
[14:43:14] <rendar> instead of copy a very big directory, i can make an hard link with `ln src/ dest/` and then once i have used it to sync data with a server, i can simply remove it, sounds right?

[14:45:48] <emanuele6> this has to be in .bashrc if you want to make it permanent

[16:32:14] <emanuele6> ls runs in a subshell, yes
[16:32:49] <horribleprogram> no 
[16:32:52] <horribleprogram> I didn't mean that
[16:33:06] <horribleprogram> like a naked executable would run in a subshell ur saying?
[16:33:14] <geirha> it creates a pipe, spawns a subshell, and runs ls inside that subshell
[16:33:22] <horribleprogram> geirha: $(ls) or ls
[16:33:25] <horribleprogram> geirha: for that
[16:33:28] <geirha> $(ls)
[16:33:31] <horribleprogram> kk ty
[16:33:44] <emanuele6> $(ls) or (ls) or ls|ls
[16:34:00] <horribleprogram> so if ur theory holds true, $(echo "hello") would not print anything
[16:34:14] <phogg> it would try to run a command called hello
[16:34:16] <horribleprogram> as the stdout of the subshell would not exist
[16:34:16] <phogg> and print an error
[16:34:29] <horribleprogram> :O
[16:34:38] <horribleprogram> WHAT THE FUCK HOW
[16:34:46] <emanuele6> it substitutes "hello" wherever you put it
[16:35:01] <emanuele6> a=$(echo hello) is the same as a=hello
[16:35:11] <horribleprogram> emanuele6: OH the output of the command becomes the result of the $() construct thingy
[16:35:19] <phogg> yes
[16:35:35] <phogg> specifically the stdout, not all output
[16:35:37] <emanuele6> so if you simply do $(echo hello), it will try to run a command called hello

[16:38:10] <horribleprogram> okay so the reason I don't understand why the output for both of those are what they are
[16:38:28] <horribleprogram> is because idk if that "function" gets invoked
[16:38:39] <emanuele6> no, that was a bad example
[16:38:49] <horribleprogram> ahh kk
[16:39:00] <emanuele6> it's because of IFS

[19:39:44] <acagastya> It works that was when I wrote in macos.
[19:39:54] <akoana> oh macos
[19:40:04] <acagastya> But that fails on debian.
[19:40:31] <acagastya> Is `sed -i ""` not POSIX compliant and added thing?

[19:41:52] <jetchisel> use ed ^^
[19:41:59] <jetchisel> !sed-i
[19:42:00] <greybot> sed -i isn't portable; standard sed doesn't have it at all, GNU sed -i has an optional argument, and BSD sed -i has a mandatory argument. See !editing and <https://wooledge.org/mywiki/BashFAQ/021> for advice on modifying files.

[19:44:05] <acagastya> Haven't tried ed ever, let me have a look.
[19:44:05] <jetchisel> there was a function to read and write in a file at the same time, hmm

[19:45:46] <jetchisel> something like that should edit the file in-place or at least looks like it, without relying on the -i flag 
[19:46:24] <akoana> echo '&copy;' > foo;  year=$(date +"%Y"); printf %s\\n  "s/copy\;/copy\; $year /" w q | ed -s foo; cat foo
[19:46:28] <akoana> # echo '&copy;' > foo;  year=$(date +"%Y"); printf %s\\n  "s/copy\;/copy\; $year /" w q | ed -s foo; cat foo
[19:46:29] <shbot> akoana: &copy; 2021
[19:47:45] <akoana> acagastya: ^^
[19:47:55] <jetchisel> On the plus side that sponge function should work on any POSIX shell and not just bash.
[19:49:10] <acagastya> I will have to tweak it though, because for minimal example I took just `copy;` -- it has other things too.
[19:49:22] <acagastya> Thanks for that!
[19:49:40] <akoana> you could also use a here document for ed scripts...
[19:49:52] <jetchisel> echo '&copy;' > foo;  year=$(date +"%Y"); printf %s\\n  "s/copy\;/copy\; $year /" %p Q | ed -s foo

[23:44:07] <iconoclasthero> what is that, regex?
[23:44:14] <iconoclasthero> and thanks, it worked
[23:44:34] <iconoclasthero> 5.3 gb in /opt/sreviio-2.1 can't be good.
[23:45:15] <geirha> not regex, but globs. It's replacing the empty string at the start of each element with "--exclude="
[23:45:47] <iconoclasthero> is [@] the empty string?
[23:46:14] <geirha> I prefer  du -haxd1 . | sort -h    # -x to avoid entering other filesystems, and -a to include files in addition to directories
