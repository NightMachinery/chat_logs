[01:48:52] <Galois> good, now you're getting somewhere
[01:49:23] <Galois> this is silly, but: p=-7 n=6 avoids the disallowed "n = p-1"

[09:46:30] <johnkeats6> how do i prove that if X is an R^n-valued random variable with components independent and N(0, 1), then so is HX for any orthogonal matrix H? N(0, 1) is easy to check but what about independent
[09:47:04] <johnkeats6> it's easy to check uncorrelated as well, but apparently that's not enough for independence
[09:47:07] *** Joins: Rum (~Rum@user/rum)
[09:47:54] <dila> johnkeats6: can i ask, how are you making the distinction between uncorrelated and independent?
[09:48:10] <johnkeats6> what do you mean?
[09:48:17] <dila> uncorrelated means first order (variance) independence only?

[09:48:46] <johnkeats6> uncorrelated means cov(X,Y) = 0. independent means P(X <= x, Y <= y) = P(X <= x)P(Y <= y)
[09:49:27] <johnkeats6> i guess the correlation argument is dumb anyway, because we have to prove they're independent as a whole and not just pairwise
[09:49:41] <frelleck> the density function is of the form a * e^{-b||x||^2}
[09:49:59] <frelleck> and the orthogonality of H implies ||H x|| = ||x||
[09:50:07] <frelleck> it boils down to that if I remember correctly
[09:51:14] <johnkeats6> the pdf of what exactly?
[09:51:20] <int-e> johnkeats6: well, you can check it for R^2 and then compose H from rotation matrices?
[09:51:49] <frelleck> a multivariate normal distribution
[09:52:13] <johnkeats6> isn't that different from just saying each coordinate is normal?
[09:52:14] <int-e> still seems tedious but at least that way you can actually set up a double integral and get to computing things

[09:56:34] <alphamule> johnkeats6:  Isn't the infamous example of that the digits of Pi?
[09:56:55] <int-e> maybe this is all too complciated; you could just look at the function..
[09:57:01] <johnkeats6> idk what you mean, the digits of pi aren't random
[09:58:02] <alphamule> Dotz0cat:  Difference of cubes works with substitution, so...
[09:58:02] <int-e> the density function is proportional to e^-||X||^2, and clearly invariant under orthogonal transformations
[09:58:05] <dila> whether it is random or not depends on how you marginalize over the process
[09:59:07] <dila> as a process producing digits, pi is deterministic. but if you let the index into the sequence be random, then the digits at that random index become random

[09:59:34] <alphamule> Which is just as true for identity function y=x
[09:59:36] <alphamule> :D
[09:59:40] <johnkeats6> so you'll still have joint pdf = product of pdfs which is independence
[09:59:52] <johnkeats6> does that make sense?
[10:00:10] <dila> even a random number generator isn't random if you know the seed. but if you let the seed by random, then the output becomes random

[10:05:48] <alphamule> You'd have no way of knowing where on the wheel you were

[10:09:13] <kakuhen> Thought it has a very dubious step involving the universal property of coproducts, verifying unit-counit relations else went smoothly.

[12:16:21] <W> Okay, gotten to the quotient of vector spaces part, this makes a whole lot more sense now. But I now have Questions: When we say reals mod integers (blackboard bold R/Z), is integers here a vector space? It's a subspace of R? What's its dimension? 1? Is the dimension of R/Z 0? Or is R/Z something slightly different from a quotient of vector spaces? Does the fact that Z is not a field enter into the picture at all?
[12:17:37] <int-e> basically the only thing that makes sense here is Z as an additive subgroup of R
[12:17:44] <W> (if anyone is curious I'm reading Sheldon Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right)
[12:19:10] <int-e> and the result isn't a vector space.
[12:19:16] <W> int-e, okay, so when I'm reading about quotients of vector spaces, I shouldn't start applying this to things like R/Z just yet, but just stick to finite-dimensional vector spaces over fields?
[12:21:17] <int-e> R/Z is not example of a quotient of vector spaces
[12:21:34] <W> I mean, it /tracks/ with the book's definitions, all the way up to when dimensions enter the picture, where it breaks down.
[12:21:43] <int-e> But you're probably equipped to understand R/Z as an additive group; the concept of a quotient isn't all that different.
[12:21:43] <W> yeah okay that clarifies, thanks :)
[12:22:18] <W> yeah, I can visualize the line of integers being shifted along R and how it's the same line for two reals with the same fractional part and so on
