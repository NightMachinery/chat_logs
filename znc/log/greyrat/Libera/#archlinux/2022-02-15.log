[01:07:19] <grawity> hmm it *might* be possible to find those at reproducible.archlinux.org, but I'm not sure if there's a complete list
[01:07:21] <masoudd> You can get the PKGBUILD used to make the package

[01:08:00] <omegatron> yeah, i'm right now at  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Build_System  trying to understand, how arch it does ..
[01:08:01] <phrik> Title: Arch Build System - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[01:08:13] <_mikey> when i boot, before the cryptsetup password prompt i get: "unable to add load options (ie: kernel command) line measurement: Volume Full". all my volumes appear to have enough space though.
[01:08:39] <grawity> nowadays there is a .BUILDINFO file in each .pkg.tar that describes the "build environment", i.e. what packages were installed on the build system
[01:09:15] <grawity> I'm guessing doing a `makepkg` on an arch system with those exact packages installed should give the exact same build output and the same package contents
[01:09:30] <grawity> at least for ocaml, which says "Reproducible Status: Good"
[01:09:56] <grawity> but other than that, the actual build log isn't part of the published package
[01:10:26] <omegatron> ah - that's too bad

[01:12:53] * grawity accidentally expands >community and watches firefox melt down
[01:13:05] <Foxboron> It should probably be noted that unreproducible packages is sometimes due to issues in the repro container
[01:13:33] <omegatron> in this certain case, i'm wondering if 1) patches are applied to the source code (of ocaml)  2) what ./configure command was used  3) if any other "special" steps have been done
[01:13:44] <grawity> well, you don't need the *build logs* for that
[01:13:48] <grawity> you want the *build script* for that
[01:13:50] <Foxboron> Like I've had issues where epoll support is turned off for some build using autotools because the test compile script is using a /dev/console thing that *DOESNT* *EXIST*

[01:15:25] <grawity> if any patches were applied, you'd see them being applied in prepare()

[01:16:18] <omegatron> we use "build log" for the entire thing (that is essentially a shell script, which does anything to build/install a certain software

[03:57:03] <brian_> Hi! I'm having some trouble with DNS on a pretty fresh arch install, and I'm hoping someone here can help me understand what's going on a little better so I can troubleshoot. I got the network interface up and working yesterday, using systemd-networkd, and things appeared to be working as they should. I could ping archlinux.org, as well as my personal domain name and 8.8.8.8. Shut it down and went to go watch the Superbowl. Today, it 
[03:57:03] <brian_> can't resolve any domain names (except mysteriously for my personal domain name), but it can still ping IP addresses out on the internet.
[03:57:53] <kstar> triteraflops: Yes, well, I ended up doing it on the shell :P
[03:58:13] <brian_> I set up /etc/systemd/network/20-wired.network like so: https://dpaste.com/3SERHCBFB. I assume this means that systemd-networkd is providing DNS resolution, using the DNS server provided by DHCP?
[03:58:25] <kstar> triteraflops: And I later realized the partition I wanted to resize was LUKS inside of LVM, so quite unlikely that a GUI tool would handle it off the shelf.
[03:58:53] <triteraflops> yeah, sudden requirements explosion

[04:09:53] <triteraflops> yeah it does

[04:10:16] <triteraflops> but it doesn't look like that's relevant. networkd doesn't use resolvconf

[04:16:12] <triteraflops> huh, weird. systemd-networkd.service indeed does not depend on systemd-resolved.service. I'd consider that a bad default.
[04:16:55] <triteraflops> for all five people who aren't configuring DNS with their network, they can make their own exception in the service description not to start resolved.
[04:17:23] <Namarrgon> tell that to the container folks that don't need resolved
[04:17:41] <Namarrgon> i'm sure there's more than five of them
[04:18:24] <Edu4rd> Why networkd should depend on resolved, you can use any other DNS manager as well
[04:18:48] <triteraflops> so there's some kind of dbus configuration interface or something?
[04:19:11] <Namarrgon> for what?
[04:19:40] <triteraflops> well, systemd-networkd gets the DNS server from DHCP, then does what with it?
[04:19:52] <triteraflops> There has to be some kind of IPC to the resolver.
[04:19:53] *** Joins: luckiswithme (~luckiswit@149.167.138.19)
[04:20:04] <Namarrgon> why?
[04:20:25] <triteraflops> or writing a file, or running a command, or some other kind of IPC with extra steps.
[04:20:42] <triteraflops> How else would the DNS server get communicated to the DNS resolver?
[04:21:04] *** Joins: srslypascal (~srslypasc@2a01:41e3:19d5:c303:1228:c031:e16f:f0f7)
[04:21:10] <Namarrgon> when you configure the interface with 'ip' and then start dhcpcd on that interface, do 'ip' and 'dhcpcd' communicate with each other?
[04:21:43] <triteraflops> If you're using dhcpcd, you're not using ip
[04:21:44] <Namarrgon> networkd and resolved do talk to each other, _if_ needed

[07:19:30] <coalballs> If you are concerned about your laptop being stolen, you are likely fine using LUKS on an SSD or hybrid drive.  An attacker would need to have access to an old passphrase (and the key-slot for this old passphrase would actually need to still be somewhere in the SSD) for your data to be at risk.  So unless you pasted your old passphrase all over the Internet or the attacker has knowledge of it from some other source and does a targeted laptop theft

[07:25:17] <A_Dragon> detached header on a disk thats easily destroyed is better
[07:25:31] <Hydragyrum> perhaps a high-voltage capacitor you can short through the ssd
[07:25:36] <A_Dragon> nope
[07:25:48] <A_Dragon> would kill the controller, flash would be fine
[07:25:52] <Hydragyrum> darn

[07:26:01] <A_Dragon> rads would be better
[07:26:02] <steerio> well, the more you destroy of that header, the further their hopes of recovery will be
[07:26:06] <A_Dragon> still take time though
[07:26:11] <steerio> also, doesn't it give you some plausible deniability?
[07:26:23] <A_Dragon> detached header? yues
[07:26:25] <steerio> you give a nonsense passphrase, it won't work, how do they prove that they have the correct header?
[07:26:25] <A_Dragon> yes*
[07:26:28] <Hydragyrum> oil well perforators do rather well at physical destruction, at least from the DEFCON talks I've seen
[07:26:33] <A_Dragon> also, dont forget coldboot attacks
[07:27:08] <A_Dragon> packing your box with explosives will work yes
[07:27:19] <A_Dragon> but as they found, not killing those around the box is a good idea
[07:27:40] <steerio> can you fry an ssd?
[07:27:45] <A_Dragon> define fry
[07:27:45] <Hydragyrum> the oil well perforators did pretty well for directed charges, not much damage besides in the direction wanted
[07:28:05] <steerio> A_Dragon: use overvoltage to actually render it unreadable; keeping everyone aroudn you alive
[07:28:07] <Hydragyrum> you can stick it in a pan with a lot of hot oil and deep fry it that way ;P
[07:28:15] <A_Dragon> steerio: OV is an issue
[07:28:25] <Hydragyrum> >  would kill the controller, flash would be fine
[07:28:27] <A_Dragon> because you can break links on the pcb before everything dies
[07:28:37] <steerio> Hydragyrum: that's what I suspected
[07:28:45] <A_Dragon> Hydragyrum: flashbacks to a particular scene in The Core
[07:28:49] <steerio> on stock SSDs at least
[07:28:56] <A_Dragon> even if you hit the flash directly
[07:28:58] <steerio> but what if this was a deliberate feature of the circuitry
[07:29:03] <A_Dragon> its... NV storage
[07:29:12] <Hydragyrum> hmm, that seems interesting
[07:29:13] <A_Dragon> its designed to survive without power
[07:29:16] <steerio> somehow damage irreparably
[07:29:24] <A_Dragon> oh thats easy
[07:29:28] <A_Dragon> drop it in a shredder
[07:29:42] <A_Dragon> then melt the pieces in lava, then spread the lava over a square mile
[07:29:43] <steerio> building shredders into laptops is not really plausible
[07:29:51] <Hydragyrum> well preferably some way where you could trigger it, oh, in a library when the fbi comes up behind you
[07:30:05] <Hydragyrum> *cough* dpr *cough*
[07:30:08] <A_Dragon> steerio: hardware destruction is hard
[07:30:09] <steerio> or you're on a Ryanair plane that your state just hijacked to get you
[07:30:17] <A_Dragon> destroy in software if you can somewhat trust the hardware
[07:30:25] <A_Dragon> but as said
[07:30:28] <A_Dragon> SSDs are fickle
[07:30:59] <Hydragyrum> what if you designed an ssd to have a line that passes directly to appropriate parts of the flash
[07:31:14] <A_Dragon> that'd work fine
[07:31:27] <Hydragyrum> at such time as needed, you hit it with a large burst i.e. from a capacitor, and fry the whole thing
[07:31:28] <A_Dragon> or just have commands in the firmware for it
[07:31:40] <A_Dragon> dont destroy the hardware
[07:31:54] <A_Dragon> for one, it makes you culpable for destruction of evideice
[07:31:57] <Hydragyrum> it may be easier to physically modify the hardware, adding a wire or two
[07:32:01] <A_Dragon> evidence* god I cant spell

[07:35:18] <steerio> A_Dragon: true about the culpability, but you'd also have to explain why you carry around a computer storing nothing but random bytes
[07:35:44] <A_Dragon> steerio: having the chance to explain is better than having no chance
[07:35:54] <steerio> right
[07:36:41] <steerio> so the reason why it can't be deleted properly is the wear leveling mechanism, right?
[07:37:06] <Hydragyrum> that's the main thing
[07:37:11] <A_Dragon> correct
[07:37:25] <A_Dragon> though killing the header is insurance against rubber hose crypto
[07:37:38] <A_Dragon> if you're not a target for that and trust the encryption, you're safe
[07:37:52] <steerio> but this affects the header just as much
[07:37:58] <A_Dragon> yes
[07:38:08] <steerio> you need a very small capacity SSD just to store the header
[07:38:14] <A_Dragon> but my point is you need not do anything if you're not going to be forced one way or another to do it
[07:38:19] <A_Dragon> thats called a flash disk
[07:38:19] <Hydragyrum> they'd still need to find the header if you just nuke the header
[07:38:21] <steerio> small enough to wipe completely in reasonable time
[07:38:29] <A_Dragon> wiping completely doesnt matter
[07:38:31] <Hydragyrum> also smol flash drive
[07:38:33] <A_Dragon> there are extra sectors 
[07:38:44] <A_Dragon> often extra entire flash chips
[07:39:32] <steerio> alright, well, since we're already talking about an imaginary hardware device
[07:39:56] <A_Dragon> secure erase claims it can target sectors directly
[07:39:56] <steerio> this thing would have no wear leveling, but would store everything 4x in a deterministic manner
[07:40:02] <A_Dragon> in the general impl
[07:40:05] <gehidore> nuke a header and see what testdisk or photorec find you might be disappointed
[07:40:06] <steerio> the whole thing would be 64 megabytes
[07:40:14] <steerio> a luks header storage device :)
[07:40:23] <A_Dragon> gehidore: the point is that while the disk may say its removed
[07:40:31] <A_Dragon> the header may still exist in off sectors
[07:40:37] <A_Dragon> because wear leveling
[07:40:43] <gehidore> yes
[07:40:44] <Ghosthree3> no one has encountered issues on standard systems with the new glibc right

For a very brief time, the data could still reside on the flash internally. However, after the TRIM command is issued and garbage collection has taken place, it's highly unlikely that even a forensic scientist would be able to recover the data.

[23:45:20] <Bayes> nope, it seems all the dependencies it has are from the official repo  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rstudio-desktop-daily-bin

[23:45:40] <Betal> Namarrgon: for some reason the lvm thinpools didn't show up, and lvm-activate-main.service failed, maybe I don't need but I have "MODULES=(dm-raid raid0 raid1 raid10 raid456)" (not using lvmraid right now)
[23:45:48] <MrElendig> -bin can be the problem, since it didn't actually get rebuilt then

[23:46:39] <Namarrgon> Betal: do you have any thin LVs?
[23:46:44] <Betal> yes
[23:46:49] <MrElendig> consider using flatpak instead if you don't want to build from source
[23:47:01] <Namarrgon> Betal: why did the service fail?

[23:47:35] <Bayes> MrElendig okay thanks, yeah I was hoping to avoid building cause it needs node and yarn and a whole chain of stuff I typically don't use

[23:49:37] <MrElendig> this is one of the things flatpak was made to solve
[23:49:42] <Warepire> Bayes: If it's electron you might be able to package it against the system electron. Some hints here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Electron_package_guidelines
[23:49:43] <phrik> Title: Electron package guidelines - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[23:50:03] <MrElendig> might want to check/poke their bugtracker too though
[23:50:03] <Bayes> AFAIK it's webkit

[23:54:58] <Warepire> Bayes: Not electron, it's definitely based on a bundled Qt though, which seems to come with webengine
[23:55:41] <Bayes> hm k
[23:56:23] <Warepire> You're probably better off switching to the compiled version in the long run, even if it means getting all those icky deps.
[23:56:37] <Warepire> *source-based version

[23:59:17] <Bayes> mhm heck
[23:59:30] <Bayes> what a pain when things break just when you need them lol
[23:59:43] <Warepire> Or if they provide an appimage, flatpack or whatever on the site.
