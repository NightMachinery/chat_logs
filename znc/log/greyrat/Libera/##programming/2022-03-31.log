[00:35:35] <dTal> You can just point it at a folder or Makefile or other build system file and start clicking your way around the source, as you describe
[00:35:48] <beaky> i personally just use text search + open the github or wiki website of whatever project i am looking at
[00:36:31] <beaky> ofc depending on the specific language i have something much better like with agda i can actually click the names of things and it shows me the source files and docs and stuff

[02:10:29] <gtst[m]> <lf94> "Is text more taxing to understan..." <- I don't have references but I'm pretty sure in most situations it's the opposite, despite what is usually advised in ux
[02:10:29] <gtst[m]> Visual hints are helpful for locating something among many items but for confirmation I would bet some significant sum that in most cases text is parsed a lot faster than an image
[02:10:45] <ProfSimm> Decker: would've been nice if we had standard size for phone and desktop and everyone just used that.
[02:10:56] <lf94> gtst[m]: I'd like to see a study
[02:11:11] <ProfSimm> Decker: adaptive UI fails are common
[02:11:13] <lf94> I believe text is easier too
[02:11:19] <lf94> It has a consistent form
[02:11:34] <lf94> And through this consistent form your brain can memorize the shape of the word
[02:11:47] <lf94> we read "apple" but we first see its shape before reading
[02:11:56] <gtst[m]> lf94: Yes sorry that's just my feeling, not supported by studies I ran into
[02:12:12] <lf94> pear - apple - visually these would look much similar
[02:12:18] <lf94> but as text they are much more distinct
[02:12:34] <lf94> so yeah, nevermind what I said: words allow things to look less consistent
[02:12:45] <lf94> this distinctiveness allows us to identify them faster

[02:21:40] <gtst[m]> Anyhow text has to be read so often by us that the brain most likely develops an extremely fast system to parse it.
[02:21:40] <gtst[m]> Additionally, when you have to find something you'll almost always have a word in mind while you do so, and recognizing that word somewhere is in all likelihood much faster than interpreting an image, associating it with the various concepts it is related to and realizing that among those concepts there's the word you have in mind.

[03:42:56] <AbleBacon> the problem with one-time pads is that you're probably using a random number generator to create them, so if people can guess what generator you were using and around what time you generated them, they can try different times on the clock to get different seeds and narrow down the possibilities to a few thousand maybe

[08:15:44] <sonny> sure, but say you have an editing interface you prefer, or you have a program from the terminal
[08:15:58] <sonny> I'll have a protocol for that
[08:16:43] <sonny> e.g. visual studio debugger is locked up inside it's GUI, that's terrible
[08:16:59] <sonny> that should just be it's own window
[08:17:08] <sonny> so you can easily have multiple instances
[08:17:48] <Decker> sure I do only run VS a few times for the debugger now... but openwatcom's debugger and resource editor work too
[08:17:51] <sonny> plugins, not sure how that would go yet
[08:18:01] <Decker> MinGW is pushing wxwidgets instead of having a proper resource editor
[08:18:11] <sonny> interesting
[08:19:08] <sonny> if I go the plugin route I may as well try to make the next browser :D
[08:19:26] <sonny> by adding interfaces for other document types

[08:29:24] <Decker> undo is like a toggle

[14:21:18] <ProfSimm> merijn: well ok this came from me.
[14:21:36] <ProfSimm> merijn: it seems it can backtrack and try multiple variations until a bigger pattern fits though
[14:21:41] <merijn> It says it can parser non-deterministic/ambiguous grammars, which is effectively referring to the fact that GLR handles "arbitrry lookahead"
[14:21:54] <ProfSimm> Right
[14:22:11] <ProfSimm> merijn: seems it's made for natural language.
[14:22:27] <ProfSimm> merijn: would it be a bad sign if a programming language needs this extensively though, is the question
[14:22:38] <merijn> LALR(1) is annoying to work with, because you need to change your grammar to work with LALR(1) which limits the grammar you can make. But the upside is that any LALR(1) grammar can *guaranteed* be parsed in constant space
[14:23:13] <merijn> ProfSimm: You should try writing some LALR(1) grammars for programming language, and you'll quickly learn why people like GLR
[14:23:17] <ProfSimm> merijn: I wonder why the stack in these always stores tokens or expressions, why not other state
[14:23:30] *** Quits: VoidSync (~sync@user/voidsync) ()
[14:23:42] <ProfSimm> merijn: well GLR may be more flexible, but maybe there's something between LALR(1) and GLR
[14:23:59] <merijn> The problem with GLR is that you still have to think, if you want an efficient parser. GLR on an efficient grammar is guaranteed efficient, but GLR has not way to prove/show that your grammar *is* efficient :p
[14:24:08] <ProfSimm> merijn: I'll be rewriting mine to be non-recursive, and I just materialize the local variables on the stack as a stack of "states" (rather than tokens or expr)
[14:24:34] <merijn> ProfSimm: the recursive refers to *the grammar* not the parser implementation
[14:25:02] <ProfSimm> merijn: that would make most real-world grammars recursive
[14:25:05] <merijn> If you have a stack of states in your parser, that means you already have a recursive grammar (because almost all grammars for useful languages are recursive)
[14:25:08] <merijn> ProfSimm: Yes

[15:50:56] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: point is this is not something you should "do", it should be just an OS thing
[15:51:10] <ProfSimm> Memory is remapped at least twice before you use it
[15:51:18] <ProfSimm> you can EASILY map a page to the end of a stack

[15:52:39] <merijn> I mean there is no stack in your process unless you (your language) makes one
[15:52:47] <bomb> ^
[15:52:48] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: that is, call stack
[15:52:52] <merijn> ProfSimm: Sure you can. The stack is an implementation detail of C
[15:53:06] <vdamewood> Just implement it differently.
[15:53:07] <ProfSimm> merijn: it's not C, it's the OS
[15:53:08] <merijn> GHC Haskell doesn't even have a callstack
[15:53:14] <amigojapan> GeDaMo: can't any array work as a stack? You can push and pop things from our
[15:53:22] <GeDaMo> Yes
[15:53:26] <PlanckWalk> You can point %rsp wherever you like.
[15:53:28] <ProfSimm> merijn: it doesn't have a callstack because it doesn't call anything
[15:53:31] <merijn> ProfSimm: Nothing in any mainstream enforces a specific stack on you
[15:53:41] <merijn> s/mainstream/mainstream OS/
[15:54:00] <PlanckWalk> If you want to request a big fat segment and poitn the stack there, then do it.
[15:54:09] <PlanckWalk> The OS won't stop you.
[15:54:12] <ProfSimm> merijn: the stack is provided by the thread. The thread is provided by the OS
[15:54:23] <PlanckWalk> *You* provide the stack the the thread.
[15:54:27] <merijn> threads don't provide a stack
[15:54:30] <ProfSimm> The thread provides it
[15:54:39] <PlanckWalk> int clone(int (*fn)(void *), void *child_stack, ...)
[15:55:08] <merijn> ProfSimm: How, exactly, does your thread provide a stack?
[15:55:18] <PlanckWalk> You just pass whatever you want as the 2nd arg to  clone()
[15:55:53] <kee> ProfSimm: You're right in that there's a mechanism for CoW stack (in Linux), but that's not fundamentally a different thing to any other memory allocation.
[15:55:55] <PlanckWalk> (Or the relevant system call if you don't want to use glibc)
[15:56:02] <amigojapan> Does does a new stack get Allocated for every program that runs?
[15:56:12] <merijn> amigojapan: There is no stack at the process level
[15:56:16] <kee> amigojapan: Unless they're started weirdly, yeah.
[15:56:28] <merijn> amigojapan: A process has its own virtual address space and it can do whatever it wants within that
[15:56:41] <bjs> amigojapan: when you start a program, the OS gives it a big chunk o' memory that the process can do what it wants with.
[15:57:03] <merijn> bjs: Technicallly it gets a big chunk of *address* space and a tiny bit of memory ;)
[15:57:12] <bjs> merijn: yeah i know
[15:57:19] <merijn> #pedantism
[15:57:33] <bjs> but the point is the process shouldn't be able to tell the difference so what does it matter
[15:57:52] <ProfSimm> merijn: my point is the OS provides it, because it implements the notion of a thread in the first place
[15:57:59] <amigojapan> So the 8mb of stack, that is a kernel thing?
[15:58:01] <kee> ProfSimm: The stack is either at C level or at the processor level, but I've never seen "it's not C, it's the OS" before.
[15:58:03] <merijn> I disagree with that statement, though. The difference is rather important and useful to things like runtime systems
[15:58:04] <PlanckWalk> The OS doesn't provide a stack.
[15:58:06] <merijn> amigojapan: No
[15:58:24] <PlanckWalk> Except in the case where the OS starts a program, e.g. via init
[15:58:27] <kee> Threads don't require a stack. x86 call instructions require a stack… but you can just use jumps if you like.
[15:58:32] <ProfSimm> kee: why would a processor care what a call stack is
[15:58:35] <amigojapan> merijn: then what limits it to 8mb?
[15:58:41] <bjs> merijn: a fundamental principle of virtual memory is that the process shouldn't be able to tell (unless the "parent" colludes) that it is being virtualised.
[15:58:41] <merijn> amigojapan: So, you have an address space ranging from 0 up 2^32 (or 2^48 on 645bit machines), yeah?
[15:58:43] <kee> ProfSimm: Don't ask me. Ask the people who designed x86.
[15:58:44] <PlanckWalk> ProfSimm: There are special instructions for working with one
[15:58:54] <bjs> ProfSimm: well as far as processors care the "stack" is just a register with a pointer in it
[15:58:57] <PlanckWalk> Also it's used in interrupts.
[15:59:10] <kee> PlanckWalk: In practice, isn't that just in kernel mode?
[15:59:19] <merijn> bjs: It shouldn't tell it's virtual sure. It should be able to tell the difference between "address space" and "memory" though
[15:59:21] <kee> I don't think the user mode stacks are used for interrupts. (I could well be wrong.)
[15:59:36] <dTal> not just x86, even CPUs as simple as the z80 provide stack instructions
[15:59:46] <bjs> ProfSimm: things like call and push and pop are just memory reads/writes to address in that register + a writeback to that register
[15:59:46] <merijn> amigojapan: So the point with virtual memory is that each process sees it's own, unique 0-2^32 address space
[15:59:50] <ProfSimm> The Win32 API CreateThread has a stack size parameter in it
[15:59:54] <ProfSimm> It's not C deciding this
[16:00:04] <kee> I find it funny when people say "as simple as the Z80" when the Z80 is a more complicated 8080.
[16:00:14] <merijn> amigojapan: Defining 8 MB of that address space as "stack" is something done at the programming language/compiler level
[16:00:17] <kee> That being said, I also say "as simple as the Z80".
[16:00:36] <merijn> amigojapan: From the OS's perspective it doesn't give a shit what you do with that memory/address space

[16:01:35] <tcsilver> hi kee!
[16:01:39] <bjs> ProfSimm: OSes are helpful in that when they give some address space to the process they know that the process is very likely to want to use some of it for a stack, so you can ask it to give you a convenient chunk with enough space and the right permissions

[16:08:31] <ProfSimm> merijn: when you make a thread...
[16:08:43] <PlanckWalk> You can tell Windows to allocate you some stack, sure.  You can also do it yourself.
[16:08:51] <merijn> ProfSimm: It doesn't. pthreads creates a stack for you, but pthreads is userspace C code, not the OS
[16:09:00] <merijn> The OS doesn't give a shit
[16:09:04] <ProfSimm> merijn: it's a syscall wrapper
[16:09:08] <PlanckWalk> And yeah, was about to say the same about pthreads
[16:09:20] <merijn> ProfSimm: The syscall, as pointed out earlier, lets you pass in your own stack to start on
[16:09:25] <PlanckWalk> The syscall wrapper is clone()
[16:09:31] <merijn> Which can be *anywhere* in memory and any size you want it to be
[16:09:34] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[16:09:46] <PlanckWalk> And one of the arguments *you* pass it is what address to start the stack on.

[16:12:01] <PlanckWalk> Well, the glibc thin wrapper for it

[16:14:33] <PlanckWalk> Both of them require you to pass an address for the child to use as a stack.
[16:15:22] <ProfSimm> Well, now we know why stacks overflow
[16:15:34] <bjs> ProfSimm: i guess the point is that when you start running the OS has given you a bunch of address space, probably quite fragmented. Some chunk of those addresses might conveniently be already setup to use as a stack if you wanted but that's all
[16:16:07] <PlanckWalk> You can of course set things up so that new stack is allocated as needed.
[16:16:13] <bjs> you can ignore that and not use a stack at all, or point your stack pointer in the middle of your "heap" or anywhere really 
[16:16:14] <PlanckWalk> It's just not very common.
[16:16:17] <ProfSimm> The OS has the ability to message the RAM controller to map a page to any address, ensuring endless continuous space for a call stack

[16:17:08] <PlanckWalk> In practice almost all processes that use more than a few MB of stack space are likely to use unbounded amount, more than any available resources.

[16:21:00] <PlanckWalk> Even if it's not written to allow it, sometimes you can change it anyway
[16:21:02] <bjs> and this is where that convention comes in, because you can ask e.g. Linux to allocate more address space in that convenient-to-use spot for the stack which usually will mean the process just has more stack space
[16:21:11] <bomb> -Xss16m argument makes stack 16 megs in Java
[16:21:33] <bjs> If the program isn't using that space for its stack, which it's totally allowed to do (but why would it?), then you'd be out of luck
[16:21:34] <ProfSimm> Any fixed size memory allocation is just silly imho
[16:21:51] <ProfSimm> Well except in a divide-and-conquer way
[16:22:16] <ProfSimm> My point is having to decide upfront "I'll use 16MB stack so take 16MB" is silly.
[16:22:38] <PlanckWalk> Many program will respect larger ulimits
[16:23:08] <ProfSimm> Chrome blows up in 10K stack frames
[16:23:25] <ProfSimm> Roughly that is
[16:23:29] <bjs> ProfSimm: well the actual code of the library/program whatever probably doesn't actually check if there is enough stack space to keep going. Which is both what causes stack overflows but also what allows you to ulimit things
[16:23:45] <bjs> it just naively keeps adding to the stack pointer assuming there's space

[16:32:36] <vdamewood> I think I want more food.
[16:32:45] <merijn> PlanckWalk: Basically, the issue is that a much faster GC implementation can be used if all haskell allocations are contiguous. Since FFI C code can use malloc, that can break that invariant by mallocing C data in between Haskell data. So the solution is to reserve (but not allocate) 2TB of contiguous address space for Haskell data, forcing any mallocs or other FFI code dealing with memory to be 
[16:32:51] <merijn> outside that contiguous block. That way you can guaranteed use the efficient GC implementation unless your code somehow uses more than 2TB memory (in which case it 1) falls back on the slower GC and 2) you probably have bigger issues ;))

[19:54:55] <RedNifre> I heard that many people issue input macros with voice commands (usually dragon speak), but I'm not aware of anything like that for mobile.
[19:55:00] <apotheon> not in situations where the system interprets something you said as that voice command and you hose up whatever you're doing because it wasn't intended
[19:55:16] <RedNifre> The closest thing I could imagine is making an app tasker compatible and then create macros in tasker.
[19:55:17] <apotheon> I haven't been following the discussion, so maybe what I said was nonsense in-context.
[19:55:39] <edgar-rft> hmm, what' with people who can't talk?

[19:58:58] <apotheon> The idea of having to use voice input for everything kinda worries me.  Voice command mechanisms are still a bit too prone to error.

[19:59:54] *** Parts: norayr (376bc34bfc@37.252.78.253) (Disconnected: closed)
[20:00:06] <apotheon> . . . and I don't think a similar level of concern for improving them to what we have with keyboards and traditional pointing devices and so on would solve that problem.  It's just a harder field to really make precise.
[20:00:16] <apotheon> beaky: "delete Windows" is a favorite
[20:00:40] <apotheon> beaky: Are you asking about what voice input software is best?
[20:01:10] <beaky> like what commands like 'computer, refactor this function for me' or something
[20:01:20] <apotheon> The only application whose name I even remember is Dragon Naturally Speaking.
[20:01:26] <apotheon> oh
[20:02:00] <beaky> would be cool to program entirely in voice

[20:03:03] <beaky> so instead of having to navigate deep context menus i can in vr just look at a function and go 'computer, jump to definitions and uses' and my entire vr workspace shifts to all the definitions and uses
[20:03:28] <apotheon> I think programming by voice commands will probably be cumbersome and finicky until machine learning systems can do at least 98% of the work for you.

[20:13:41] <apotheon> I'm not saying it's not doable.  Obviously it is.  It would just be more cumbersome and finicky.
[20:15:20] <apotheon> . . . and likely much more mentally draining, as a result.
[20:15:37] *** Joins: Macbethwin (~chargen@D964062A.static.ziggozakelijk.nl)
[20:15:45] <beaky> yes might be much nicer i had like better structured editing support 
[20:15:46] <apotheon> Getting used to it would reduce some of those problems, but not eliminate them.
[20:18:14] <apotheon> A special text processing language of keyboard commands (e.g. the vi language) is extremely efficient for most aspects of programming.  For those that are less well handled by that aspect, a small subset can be handled by things like macros, and the rest is essentially intractable except by software being able to "understand" what you want with extremely high levels of correctness.
[20:18:57] <apotheon> That last bit is pretty much the only part that's perhaps better suited to heuristic input systems like speach or vision-tracking recognition.
[20:20:57] <apotheon> There's software that allows for extremely fast text entry via vision tracking, by the way, though I think it requires a helluva lot of practice to compete with fast touch-typing without occasionally blowing up everything you're doing.

[21:13:46] <vdamewood> As best as I can figure, they still act like they support C++/Win32 as a first-class environment, and they're trying to move WinForms users to WPF.
[21:14:08] <apotheon> Microsoft itself seems to be doing more with JavaScript/TypeScript and Chromium/Electron, but that's kinda like Dad taking a drag on his Marlboro and saying "Do what I do, not what I say.  Don't smoke."

[23:43:38] <ElderMalaclypse> kee: That doesn't make it grammatically correct -- just idiomatically.
[23:43:44] <kee> sonny: To be fair, it's America.
[23:43:45] <independent56> Geolykt, It's flexible as you also have the choice to port it to another language :p
[23:43:57] <sonny> kee: still one of the best countries ever
[23:44:00] <kee> Apparently you have to pay a fee to renounce your citizenship.
[23:44:09] <BASHitup> I don't know. I'm going to affirm an appeal to authority fallacy as I was a freelance journalist at one point. 
[23:44:28] <Rounin> Not to mention, many embassies aren't accepting renunciations now
[23:44:33] <ElderMalaclypse> BASHitup: Tell me more about this freelance journalism career.
[23:44:38] <BASHitup> I wrote for a Pulitzer-winning paper: The Indianapolis Star. 
[23:44:40] <kee> And if you don't renounce your citizenship, they keep charging you taxes for services you're not benefiting from.
[23:44:48] <sonny> no dual citzenship sucks though ngl

[23:44:52] <Geolykt> independent56: That sounds more like it
[23:44:55] <Rounin> So you may have to move to another country in order to be able to renounce
[23:45:02] <BASHitup> Ha, I never made any money. I did get recognition. I get professional discounts to The New Yorker and VAnity Fair. 
[23:45:13] <BASHitup> I got super high professional recognition but got paid peanuts 
[23:45:24] <Rounin> Then again, some countries don't ever let you renounce, so there is that
[23:45:31] <BASHitup> I always relished the idea that a $200 story or even $50 story could make or break someone's career. 
[23:45:32] <kee> BASHitup: Sounds like a murdered newspaper alright.

[23:47:12] <BASHitup> The big stories were mostly given to the staff. But they gave me a few because I was trusted. 
[23:47:36] <BASHitup> Stringers are sort of like minute men ... They'd call us last minute or on-demand. 
[23:47:42] <ElderMalaclypse> kee: yes
[23:47:59] <kee> The newspapers have been being killed for decades.
[23:48:11] <kee> But yeah, it might've always been that way; I don't know.
[23:48:15] <Rounin> Hm... It's interesting how in some businesses, contractors get paid less, and in others, they get paid more
[23:48:20] <BASHitup> Well, it's sad what's happened to media in the age of Trump 
[23:48:30] <BASHitup> It's Orwellian. Good is bad, right is wrong. Truth is false. 
[23:48:32] <Rounin> Perhaps it's a supply and demand thing
[23:49:46] <kee> Very few things are actually markets.
[23:49:48] <ElderMalaclypse> It's a supply and demand thing as manipulated by structural artificial scarcity distortions.
[23:50:06] <kee> "Supply and demand" doesn't apply to any of the classic things people call "supply and demand" on.
[23:50:28] <ElderMalaclypse> . . . so, in a way, not supply and demand.

[23:51:57] <ElderMalaclypse> To a significant degree, the real reason newspapers are struggling in the age of the internet is the fact that the internet is good at breaking various types of artificial scarcity.
[23:52:03] <BASHitup> It's supply and demand. It's also the obvious that people are getting news from Twitter and Instagram. God forbid: Facebook. And that's not really news - that's what someone's second cousin or best friend thinks and those people in most cases aren't professionals with any training etc. 
[23:52:22] <kee> Facebook is not supply and demand.

[23:53:05] <ProfSimm> Interesting discovery about JS performance: if you have few instances with many methods, prototype is SLOWER. If you have many instances with few methods, prototype is SLOWER. If you have many instances with many methods, prototype is again slower, but saves memory. 
[23:53:06] <Rounin> ElderMalaclypse: It's also eliminated some very real kinds of scarcity, though, surely, since you can now just copy a bunch of books or newspapers or entire films for a few cents

[23:54:43] <independent56> Are software licenses protected by copyright? Would i be allowed to just steal a license from a half-open-source project?
[23:54:52] <ElderMalaclypse> or vice versa
[23:54:54] <ElderMalaclypse> it's hazy
[23:55:03] <Rounin> ElderMalaclypse: Yeah, you can only tell people "don't copy that floppy" so many times...
[23:55:06] <ElderMalaclypse> independent56: Yes, they're protected by copyright.
[23:55:13] <independent56> Dammit
[23:55:18] <ElderMalaclypse> independent56: Wait.  The license itself?
[23:55:19] <ProfSimm> independent56: licenses are entirely based on copyright.
[23:55:20] <kee> independent56: You could write your own license, though.
[23:55:25] <ElderMalaclypse> Oh, that's a complicated question, actually.
[23:55:32] <ProfSimm> independent56: without the right to copy, you can't license the right to copy.
[23:55:35] <kee> ElderMalaclypse: The license itself is protected by copyright.
[23:55:39] <independent56> Are the "free licenses" (MIT, GPL3, apache) in the public domain?

[23:55:43] <BASHitup> You don't even have to write copyright for the copyright to be protected. AT least not for literary work. 
[23:55:43] <kee> No.
[23:55:45] <Rounin> independent56: If you mean the licence texts, many of them are meant to be widely used, though
[23:55:48] <ProfSimm> independent56: no
[23:55:52] <ElderMalaclypse> Yes . . . but it's difficult to enforce it if someone is cribbing legal language.
[23:55:58] <BASHitup> My manuscript ... I can simply prove it's mine and that I created the original content. 
[23:56:20] <ElderMalaclypse> Technically protected by copyright . . . but easily circumvented by a good reader/writer who can reason a bit about legalities.
[23:56:53] <ElderMalaclypse> yes to what kee said to me
[23:56:59] <ElderMalaclypse> not to the question about the public domain
[23:57:12] <BASHitup> Yeah, I don't know. I keep thinking anyone can buy their way out of a legal problem if that person has the money for a good lawyer and the case comes with ambiguity. Of course the venue matters to: country, city, location etc. 
[23:57:24] <ElderMalaclypse> BASHitup: That's mostly true.
[23:57:27] <kee> That's why you don't put ambiguity in your licenses.
[23:57:35] <kee> You write them in plain English, then you take them to a lawyer to dissect.
[23:57:46] <kee> Then you take the lawyer's advice.
[23:57:55] <kee> Then you take the license to another lawyer…
