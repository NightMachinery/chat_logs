[00:00:44] <da_wunder> but looks like you won't do that, so have a nice eaving - I hope that you got your issue solved
[00:02:37] <Blondie101010> Alexander-47u:  simply reading the conversation tells us that the problem is not where you think it is
[00:03:31] <Blondie101010> you'll need to clarify the real problem, and use traces to find why it's happening
[00:06:20] <da_wunder> but most likely your issue is that you're passing an array to some function/method where you use that sort, and you're assuming that is changed outside of that scope - quite easy to spot out - imho

[00:08:45] <Alexander-47u> da_wunder, yes that was the problem indeed. counter mistake :$
[00:09:52] <Alexander-47u> whats the best way to keep a counter, where function a has the counter that needs to be incremented from within nested function b
[00:09:54] <Alexander-47u> ?
[00:10:28] <da_wunder> not sure what you're trying to do, so once again I ask share your code - so that we could understand what you're trying to do...
[00:10:34] <da_wunder> fifth time...
[00:14:33] <Alexander-47u> this is the issue im having
[00:14:34] <Alexander-47u> https://ibb.co/phWHCVg
[00:14:46] <Alexander-47u> see the values going from 1, 11, 12, then 2 etc
[00:15:31] <Albright> Cast to integer, then sort
[00:16:24] <Albright> Also, note that all your radio buttons have the same ID. Your labels aren't going to work.
[00:16:39] <da_wunder> or use natsort
[00:16:46] <Alexander-47u> yeah I know thanks
[00:16:49] <Alexander-47u> natsort, gonna try :D
[00:18:27] <da_wunder> Alexander-47u: and really I don't see that problem within this _simple_ example - https://3v4l.org/IknLU
[00:19:07] <da_wunder> so sixth time - please provide some example within 3v4l.org site
[00:19:16] <Alexander-47u> thanks buddy, natsort worked
[00:19:55] <Alexander-47u> da_wunder, thats because I figured it would be easier just to find out the right sort instruction

[05:39:38] <up_running> Can anyone assist with this problem, please?
[05:39:39] <up_running> https://dpaste.com/G548265LW#wrap
[05:42:29] <Blondie101010> hmmmm, that is not a question
[05:44:03] <up_running> Blondie101010: Just looking for ideas.
[05:44:05] <Blondie101010> there are php extensions and tools that can help with reading Excel file format and for pdf output
[05:44:32] <up_running> Would you say this is something that I can do as a complete beginner who is reading about PHP currently?
[05:45:04] <Blondie101010> that depends on you, but if you persevere enough, sure
[05:45:18] <up_running> How long would this take you approximately?
[05:45:56] <Blondie101010> your requirements are too limited to estimate that
[05:46:13] <up_running> Oh and I forgot to include that this must be done from scratch since it's an in-house project.
[05:46:31] <syco> 10 years +/-
[05:46:44] <Blondie101010> up_running:  what do you mean about that weird constraint?
[05:47:00] <up_running> Blondie101010: well, could you at least rank this project in terms of difficulty based on your experience?
[05:47:02] <Blondie101010> I'd go more like 25 years with the last line
[05:47:11] <up_running> I assume you're at the advanced level?
[05:47:14] <Blondie101010> I asked a question
[05:47:31] <Blondie101010> what is your stupid constraint of doing it in-house?
[05:47:53] <up_running> Blondie101010: Ah. Yes, I don't think extensions will be allowed.
[05:47:58] <up_running> At least, from what I was told.
[05:48:18] <Blondie101010> please explain
[05:48:18] <up_running> It is to be done "from scratch" are the directions I received.
[05:48:50] <Blondie101010> so your boss asked you, a non programmer, to write an application from scratch?
[05:49:04] <syco> clean up that excell output first if it changes ..
[05:49:37] <up_running> Blondie101010: It's not a paid task; more of an assignment, but yes.
[05:49:44] <Blondie101010> please clarify
[05:49:50] <Blondie101010> what the heck is that request?
[05:50:27] <up_running> Blondie101010: I assumed from scratch eliminates extensions, but I could be wrong.
[05:50:39] <up_running> I will inquire about this tomorrow since you do have a good point here.
[05:50:45] <up_running> I shouldn't assume.
[05:50:46] <Blondie101010> who asked you that?
[05:51:05] <up_running> Who asked me what?
[05:51:13] <Blondie101010> to do that task
[05:51:56] <up_running> Ah, a leader of a group I'm helping out with
[05:52:13] <up_running> Blondie101010: And again, as I mentioned above, I do have a bit of JS experience via self-study.
[05:52:24] <Blondie101010> and you're their IT expert I presume
[05:52:24] <up_running> So, I'm not a total non-programmer.
[05:52:42] <up_running> I just lack PHP experience and ANY professional programming experience.
[05:52:59] <up_running> Blondie101010: not expert, but helper
[05:53:02] <Blondie101010> start detailing your requirements in steps, and the more you move on, the more it will become the actual code
[05:53:39] <Blondie101010> so you want to read an Excel spreadsheet, so start with that
[05:53:55] <up_running> Yes, I think I understand the logic. I just would like to see from an advanced PHP user's perspective if this is realistic given the task.
[05:53:56] <Blondie101010> but I wonder about your output
[05:54:16] <up_running> Some tasks are just simply beyond me as a beginner and I am ok with that if that's the case
[05:54:26] <up_running> others are doing with *much* effort
[05:54:33] <up_running> and still others are quite simple
[05:54:41] <up_running> s/doing/doable
[05:57:21] <Blondie101010> why would they tell you to do things in house?
[05:58:02] <up_running> Blondie101010: Not sure yet.
[05:58:08] <Blondie101010> and again I'm concerned about your output
[05:58:26] <Blondie101010> is it a pdf form that you simply fill manually?
[05:58:48] <up_running> yes, exactly
[05:58:56] <up_running> but that takes far too long to copy and paste
[05:59:07] <Blondie101010> haven't played with that but that *might* make things more complicated
[05:59:07] <up_running> so, that is where i need to provide the fix of automation
[05:59:36] <up_running> i have acrobat pro and there are editable fields for input
[05:59:51] <Blondie101010> everything depends on the actual details
[05:59:58] <Blondie101010> on what exactly needs to be your output
[06:00:08] <up_running> there is one link i was reading that seems interesting and potentially relevant
[06:00:12] <up_running> i'll share it, one sec
[06:00:14] <Blondie101010> you may have to generate the full PDF yourself
[06:00:28] <up_running> yes, i was thinking that also
[06:00:31] <syco> don't use excell, or at least clean the output and stuff it in a DB
[06:01:07] <up_running> Blondie101010: or at least copy and paste the details of the template and generate a new pdf with the automation copde
[06:01:08] <Blondie101010> and saying "in-house" without any context could be as ridiculous as expecting you to implement the Excel file format from scratch, and same with PDF output
[06:01:13] <up_running> s/copde/code
[06:01:34] <up_running> Blondie101010: oh no! only the php from scratch is what they mean
[06:01:40] <up_running> that i'm sure of
[06:01:48] <up_running> well, i think i'm sure about that
[06:01:54] <Blondie101010> hmm k
[06:02:10] <up_running> it would be totally unrealistic if they mean otherwise
[06:02:28] <Blondie101010> so right now you're manually copy-pasting the data in a pdf viewer, and then what?
[06:03:02] <up_running> only the data that we're interested in is copy pasted to the pdf
[06:03:14] <Blondie101010> yes, then what?
[06:03:24] <Blondie101010> you paste in the PDF thingy and then?
[06:03:29] <up_running> then, info from that pdf is put into a memo
[06:03:43] <up_running> more copy pasting
[06:03:58] <Blondie101010> no I mean right after
[06:04:07] <Blondie101010> how do you edit/fill the form?
[06:04:08] <up_running> they want all this to be fully automated, if at all possible
[06:04:32] <up_running> Blondie101010: in the editable fields, I presume
[06:04:52] <Blondie101010> then you save, and email it or similar?
[06:04:57] <up_running> I didn't physically see the form get filled out, but that's how I presume it occurred.
[06:05:05] <Blondie101010> what
[06:05:24] <Blondie101010> what exactly do you presently do?
[06:05:46] <up_running> I don't do anything. My task is to automate what the other team does.
[06:06:06] <up_running> I was just filled in on the details in a meeting.
[06:06:08] <Blondie101010> ok ask your boss for help
[06:06:19] <up_running> they have given it already
[06:06:31] <up_running> the meeting was long and many questions were asked
[06:06:35] <Blondie101010> they should hire qualified personnel
[06:06:49] <syco> lol
[06:06:52] <up_running> I think I understand the task; it's just implentation is the issue to be considered
[06:07:24] <up_running> Blondie101010: but back to what is currently done, I can explain that
[06:07:32] <Blondie101010> you don't even know what you're automatihng
[06:07:42] <up_running> so, you check your email and there is an excel file
[06:07:45] <Blondie101010> that's like step -10
[06:07:48] <Blondie101010> get to work
[06:08:06] <up_running> you open it and there is an excel file with many columns and data in it
[06:08:16] <up_running> you also now open up your pdf form
[06:08:19] <up_running> the template
[06:08:39] <up_running> let's say it's a list of equipment
[06:08:51] <Blondie101010> if it comes in by email, you need to get your script to check emails, or send the message differently
[06:09:12] <Blondie101010> as I first mentioned, your initial task involves reading Excel and writing PDF
[06:09:15] <syco> that excell stuff should be clean in the first place
[06:09:18] <Blondie101010> so look for tools to do that
[06:09:27] <up_running> I am automating or facilitating the copy paste process
[06:09:37] <syco> omfg
[06:09:39] <up_running> sorry, if I wasn't clear about that earlier
[06:09:47] <Blondie101010> facilitating the copy-paste process could be totally different
[06:09:51] <up_running> but let's continue with my example above
[06:09:58] <up_running> i think seeing this example will help
[06:10:18] <Blondie101010> I've done varioud types of automation and some can be UI based
[06:10:19] <up_running> so, now you have the excel file open and also the pdf template open
[06:10:24] <Blondie101010> *various
[06:10:55] <Blondie101010> but that's not ideal as it locks up a computer and is usually less efficient than a human
[06:11:36] <up_running> you see all the equipment and your current task is that you need to list all the equipment in the pdf that is over $500 and is marked for disposal.
[06:12:00] <syco> ...
[06:12:00] <up_running> What is done currently?
[06:12:19] <up_running> Copy and paste each field of interest into the pdf form manually.
[06:12:36] <Blondie101010> up_running:  what is your job title?  that makes a huge difference, really
[06:12:46] <up_running> Blondie101010: let's stop here briefly
[06:12:52] <up_running> does that make sense, so far?
[06:13:06] <syco> nope
[06:13:13] <Blondie101010> if you had started off with "data entry clerk" then I would have helped you more clearly
[06:13:22] <up_running> syco: what's is confusing specifically?
[06:13:35] <Blondie101010> but it would still involve telling your boss to hire skilled workers
[06:13:46] <syco> huhu
[06:13:56] <up_running> Blondie101010: I just would like to assist where I can.
[06:14:06] <Blondie101010> you already failed
[06:14:37] <up_running> Can you please tell me where the example does not make sense?
[06:14:42] <Blondie101010> you can change that if you start working on it like I suggested
[06:14:54] <up_running> I'll try my best to explain it better
[06:15:07] <Blondie101010> go clarify the steps needed and break them down as much as possible
[06:15:33] <Blondie101010> then look for tools to read Excel and write PDF
[06:15:35] <up_running> but what part of the steps I've explained thus far is confusing is my current question
[06:15:40] <syco> manager/beancounter/hr guy spotted
[06:15:43] <Blondie101010> then practice by example or by following the manuals
[06:16:51] <Blondie101010> that's how most software is developed
[06:17:24] <Blondie101010> that's actually where the term "developped" comes from
[06:17:31] <Blondie101010> you develop the plan
[06:18:36] <up_running> Ok, I'll just list the plan I think will work and you can critique it if you like
[06:19:21] <up_running> Create text boxes where one can list the interested fields and then the input fields will autopopulate in the pdf
[06:19:53] <up_running> This is analogous to the print preview page selection box in Word
[06:20:14] <up_running> that way they won't have to copy paste and can simple type the numbers
[06:20:22] <up_running> typing is much quicker than clicking
[06:20:28] <syco> :')
[06:20:40] <up_running> Blondie101010: how about that?
[06:21:28] <Blondie101010> I think your current title probably suits you fine

[12:57:46] <freeman_h> hi guys, what is the best way to find out the actual version of packages a project is using? composer.json has those * and ^ which gives you an idea of the min version it should using but if the project is up and running what can I get a list of the actual version e.g. looking for something like 3.5.8 instead of ^3.5 hope that make sense
[12:58:34] <TinoDidriksen> "composer show"

[16:43:36] <olle> I had no idea GET params are encrypted.
[16:43:47] <olle> I always thought the entire URL was sent in clear-text on the network
[16:44:40] <Naktibalda> have you discovered HTTPS today?
[16:44:52] <olle> No
[16:45:05] <olle> I just thought header + POST body encrypted, URL not encrypted
[16:45:15] <olle> So FQDN is not encrypted, but params are
[16:45:25] <Naktibalda> what?
[16:46:10] <olle> www.google.com?blablabla <---- blablabla is encrypted, not the other stuff
[16:46:23] <Naktibalda> talking about HTTPS?
[16:46:25] <olle> Yes
[16:47:14] <Naktibalda> well, request is made over encrypted connection, so everything HTTP related is encrypted.
[16:47:41] <olle> It has to do with DNS protocol, iirc
[16:47:49] <Naktibalda> yep, that's different
[16:48:07] <olle> That's why FQDN is sent in clear-text
[16:48:14] <olle> Maybe I should find a source...
[16:48:30] <Naktibalda> so your ISP can see your DNS lookup and it can see target IP of TCP connection. I think there was a lot of noice about secure DNS last year
[16:48:45] <olle> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/499591/are-https-urls-encrypted
[16:48:56] <olle> 13 years ago
[16:50:45] <AllenJB> I think the 2nd answer there explains it best
[16:51:40] <AllenJB> The Server Name (FQDN) may be sent in plain text for TLS 1.2 or if the client does not support encrypting it in TLS 1.3 to support SNI (multiple SSL sites on 1 IP)
[16:52:18] <AllenJB> GET parameters will always be encrypted
[16:52:46] <olle> Well. My main concern was whether temporary authentication tokens are a safe way to automatically create a login session, even when included as GET param. Seems so.

[16:53:51] <olle> Yeah? I was thinking stored in browser history. But temporary = couple of minutes max.
[16:54:37] <Blondie101010> olle:  if your token is well done, it would be as safe over clear text
[16:54:57] <olle> Eh? No.
[16:55:06] <Blondie101010> definitely
[16:55:12] <olle> With shared secret, in that case.
[16:55:45] <Blondie101010> sure, though I'm not saying not to use HTTPS
[16:56:23] <olle> Oh yeah, one can use both.
[16:56:42] <olle> Wait, shared secret won't help if the URL is compromised.
[17:00:04] <__adrian> you don't need a shared secret for a one-time use auth token
[17:00:19] <__adrian> in the simplest case, it can just be a random string.
[17:00:21] <olle> No, it won't add any security.

[17:22:50] <bodom> Hi there! How does PHP tells the difference between a callable ['class','method'] and an array ['string1','string2']?
[17:23:28] <Blondie101010> if you give it the array as a callable, it will try to use it
[17:23:51] <Blondie101010> so PHP doesn't decide, your code does
[17:23:56] <olle> But use foo(...) instead
[17:24:54] <bodom> Blondie101010: i was mostly thinking about is_callable() and is_array()
[17:25:18] <olle> Old parts of PHP --> No type safety
[17:25:34] <olle> Use the new (...) syntax
[17:25:34] <Blondie101010> is_array() will be true for sure...  for is_callable(), I'd test it out to be sure :)
[17:26:12] <bodom> ok, so the first case is both a callable and an array. Got it, thanks!
[17:27:10] <bodom> and i suppose there is no way to create an array which can't be a callable?
[17:28:14] <Naktibalda> you can't create a string that can't be callable either
[17:28:43] <bodom> that's an interesting point!
[17:34:50] <relipse> So I have 10 csv text files that I am to convert to mysql tables, My idea was to write some sort of generic php assoc array to mysql create table and insert feature. What do you guys think?
[17:35:02] <relipse> all the tables can be varchar for now

[18:47:01] <stenno> .i.e. $foo will look like ['bar' => ['baz' => [23]]]

[21:12:35] <The_Blode> Hey guys, I'm setting up a WAMP server...I'm being offered 7.4.27, 8.0.15, 8.1.2.
[21:12:57] <The_Blode> My little project was running on < 7.4...would I face any kind of issue with going to 8?
[21:13:00] <Rockwood> The_Blode, bad choice
[21:13:07] <The_Blode> Should I just go for it and roll it back if it doesn't work?
[21:13:19] <TinoDidriksen> Go to latest version, fix your code if any issues occur.
[21:13:21] <Rockwood> WAMP is not good for start
[21:14:36] *** Joins: malmalmal (~malmalmal@38.pool92-178-53.dynamic.orange.es)
[21:15:24] <The_Blode> Fair enough, Tino. Thanks.
[21:15:26] <The_Blode> Why is WAMP not good?
[21:15:56] <TinoDidriksen> Windows in general is not a good server platform, and PHP for Windows is not well supported.
[21:16:14] <The_Blode> Oh
[21:16:24] <TinoDidriksen> Plus, combo-packages like WAMP are often also just less than good.
[21:16:30] <Rockwood> VM and many more out of box
[21:16:34] <The_Blode> Can't argue with that.
[21:17:10] <TinoDidriksen> Since you'll almost certainly be deploying to a Linux environment anyway, do yourself a favour and run the local dev server on Linux as well - either via a virtual machine or WSL.
[21:18:03] <The_Blode> Well, I have my dev server on Debian...but it's running on a Pi 3...so I have this new Windows Mini PC which is like 3x as powerful.
[21:18:31] <The_Blode> So I wanted to utilise the horsepower of this new PC
[21:18:56] <The_Blode> Maybe install MariaDB too and do some database stuff on it.

[21:20:14] <The_Blode> Hey adrian, WSL = the Linux subsystem?
[21:20:18] <__adrian> yes
[21:20:29] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi can i PM you?
[21:20:31] <__adrian> or roll your own VM or use windows docker tools
[21:20:31] <The_Blode> It's been many years I'm out of the Windows loop.
[21:20:45] <The_Blode> I did hear some years back about this Linux integration (of sorts)
[21:20:47] <__adrian> Rockwood: sure
[21:21:07] <__adrian> The_Blode: wsl *2*. look for tutorials, i hear it's pertty good.
[21:21:31] <The_Blode> Turning it on in the features :)
[21:21:39] <The_Blode> I'm also running cygwin which is working fine.

[21:27:40] <goddard> better off just using linux as said already
[21:31:44] <__adrian> using windows is fine. note that making a dev env on your linux desktop OS is _not_ any better than xampp/wamp.
[21:31:58] <__adrian> if docker/wsl gotchas, then use a full on vm

[21:35:25] <da_wunder> windows + virtualbox linux + docker doesn't have that problem, although you've one more virtualizing layer there
[21:35:42] <da_wunder> windows + wsl2 comes close to that, but it's still slower
[21:36:11] <da_wunder> with mac you need to use some external tools like parallers

[21:39:36] <__adrian> sure
[21:43:37] <__adrian> (actually wasn't aware of windows docker problems. once bricked a macbook using docker though.)
[21:45:01] <da_wunder> this is one tool that you could use with windows and mac - http://docker-sync.io/
[21:45:23] <da_wunder> but that isn't so good if/when you've multiple projects using docker
[21:46:02] <__adrian> performance concerns notwithstanding, my point was that your desktop OS shouldn't double-duty as your dev env
[21:46:19] <da_wunder> that is basically just making that file sync between host and docker machine via another container - sounds crazy, but it actually works
