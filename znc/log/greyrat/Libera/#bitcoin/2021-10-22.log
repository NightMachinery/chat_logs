[02:23:10] <luke-jr> DavidBakin: there is no reason to assume a wallet only has one seed; if you're changing the passphrase, it makes sense to use a new one

[02:25:16] <DavidBakin> ok, i just didn't know the wallet had the capability! I knew the legacy wallets could have multiple private keys - needed to because all were completely independent - but didn't know that a HD wallet had multiple seeds therefore could have multiple trees.  (I should play with it more.)
[02:26:14] *** Joins: Darkcoal (~user@139.64.63.46)
[02:26:19] <DavidBakin> but basically, the operation to encrypt a wallet _adds_ a new seed, the previous one is _still there_?  and you can receive to/send from addresses from both?
[02:27:38] <DavidBakin> (since we're talking about the doc `managing-wallets.md` - and since it confused me (considering myself as a "typical" new user) - perhaps I'll try to reword it/add some material and submit it.
[02:29:06] <luke-jr> DavidBakin: the previous one is no longer used/active
[02:29:14] <luke-jr> but it doesn't delete it, because it still controls funds
[02:29:34] <luke-jr> if you make an address, it will only use the new seed
[02:29:52] <luke-jr> HD and such topics really aren't an end user thing - they're internal implementation details

[02:30:53] <DavidBakin> well ... but ... I distinctly got the idea that `managing-wallets.md` was in fact meant for the end user.  No?  I mean, that warning about making sure you backup your new wallet: sounds definitely interesting for the end user to know!
[02:31:50] <DavidBakin> (besides, the notion of "end user" for a full raw Bitcoin Core node not surrounded by supporting software - e.g., wallets and scripts and stuff - implies a rather sophisticated end user I would think ...
[02:34:07] <luke-jr> O.o
[02:35:37] <luke-jr> I mean, I'd recommend Knots, but Core isn't *that* much harder. The only real need for surrounding software these days should be if you want Lightning support

[02:42:44] <DavidBakin> well ... i participate in the raspiblitz area ... and their telegram channel - and leaving aside lightning which has a _very_ steep learning curve even bitcoin core causes new users problems - not when it is running fine, but every once in awhile if it runs into trouble.  it is not self-correcting (nor should it be) and it is not easy to diagnose from debug logs (which maybe there should be another way to diagnose
[02:42:44] <DavidBakin> trouble/recommend fixes).  that's what I'm talking about: it needs a fairly sophisticated user (though still, as I said, light years away from where you need to be to run your own lightning node).  Now, if you're saying that bitcoin/docs is full of internals only documentation meant for the dev or contributor, and end users should have some other source of information, that's fine, I would accept that.  But ... well, is that
[02:42:45] <DavidBakin> the case?
[02:49:12] <luke-jr> there shouldn't be problems.
[02:49:54] <luke-jr> generally when there is, the user has faulty hardware
[02:56:17] <DavidBakin> maybe that is generally the case, it isn't always the case.  but I disagree that even so that bitcoin core is easy to use - wasn't there just recently some guy sadly complaining that his bitcoin core installation stole all his money?  of course, he had downloaded it from who knows where and it was some hacked version - after seen that (I thought it was on one of these irc channels actually) I went and found YOUR excellent
[02:56:17] <DavidBakin> writeup on medium of how to securely install bitcoin - and it was an very good step-by-step explanation of what you needed to do - and you know that stuff backward and forwards of course, but some evening put yourself in the position of someone enthusiastic about bitcoin, and its prospects, and wanting to "run their own node" for whatever reason (it is promoted everywhere next to the slogan of "not your keys not your coin") and
[02:56:18] <DavidBakin> then ... they want to do it right so they find your writeup ... read your own article from _that_ point of view and I think you'll admit: just to verify you've got a legit bitcoin: NOT SO DAMN EASY!

[03:00:59] <DavidBakin> so i agree with that ... but the access to the web is free to all, bitcoin core is free to all, it is promoted (perhaps not be the main developers but by the bitcoin news/education/prosylization ecosystem) as free to all: run your own node!  so ... I myself _am_ such a sophisticated user, no problem.  But as we saw in the discussion that preceeded this ... there are still things in the docs that confuse me, right?  Is that so
[03:00:59] <DavidBakin> unusual?
[03:01:42] <earnestly> I don't believe in equality
[03:04:06] <DavidBakin> oh that's fine ... but given the way things actually are in the real world ... do you think it reasonable to wall off bitcoin core from the hoi polloi?  or just ignore them when they try to join in and get burned?  don't you think those actions might have repercussions?  do you think you can somehow control those who are promoting 'run your own node' from doing that promotion?  I'm fine with running my own node and eveyrthing
[03:04:06] <DavidBakin> that goes with it - I've got two in fact.  So?  Can I not be concerned that, maybe, the docs could be improved?
[03:06:09] <earnestly> I don't know, it's an interesting experiment
[03:06:27] <DavidBakin> i realize i've just joined in the community here on IRC.  you don't know me at all.  i have no rep.  I just have questoins.  I am trying to learn and am totally capable of learning - I've been a software engineer for decades, working at major software companies, and startups, and in between.  I'm new to YOU guys, yes.  But I'm not _complaining_.  I'm in awe of the accomplishments here.  I'm just trying to learn.
[03:07:01] <earnestly> How this will balance all the various attacks against it, how it needs adoption but at a pace that won't cause collapse or won't end up being useless, etc.
[03:07:30] <DavidBakin> and part of that learning is learning the _culture_. every company I've worked at: the relationship between the engineers on a team, between teams, between the dev engineers and the management: it's always different, always has to be learned.
[03:07:42] <DavidBakin> that's the stage i'm in.
[03:08:05] <earnestly> I don't think anyone can 'engineer' the social aspects of bitcoin
[03:08:17] <DavidBakin> made more awkward (and annoying too) because IRC is _not_ an ideal channel for meeting people and getting to know them.
[03:08:26] <DavidBakin> you're not getting what I'm saying, probably because I'm not saing it well.
[03:09:19] <earnestly> You type a lot and I don't read most of it.  Your suggestions about how to 'guide' bitcoin is what I'm responding to
[03:09:28] <DavidBakin> I'm saying: as an engineer I'm used to joining a culture, learning how it operates - which is alwyas unique since it is always grown organically over time - and then adapting to that culture so I can be effective.  I'm not some progressive activist trying to change the bitcoin culture and I certainly don't believe it can be "engineered"
[03:10:00] <DavidBakin> I want to adapt MYSELF to it.
[03:10:21] <earnestly> Culture is downstream from law, and a lot like conway's law, that probably reflects it
[03:10:47] <earnestly> There isn't 'a culture', or 'a community'.  There's pockets of people doing things in a distributed manner, (see conway)
[03:11:14] <DavidBakin> i think we're talking past eac other, probably don't have a common frame of reference
[03:11:19] <earnestly> There are people who see it as mere investment tokens, some who read rothbard and see it as a money, etc.
[03:11:55] <earnestly> So how you 'adapt' is by whatever position you agree with (or invest your own)
[03:12:03] <earnestly> invest/invent
[03:14:15] <earnestly> DavidBakin: If you're more interested in developing bitcoin core, then they have a specific channel for it.  Not much happens here
[03:15:23] <earnestly> If you want to make it a bit easier for users, there's projects like yeti

[15:21:49] <Guest44> I read some article about Bitcoin
[15:21:53] <Guest44> what is this
[15:21:55] <Guest44> ?
[15:22:10] <Guest44> "Over the last decade, a small group of individuals and a few for-profit corporations have completely taken over the majority of Bitcoin-related communication channels. The result of this is widespread censorship, personal attacks, doxing, multi-million dollar scams, and a toxic environment."

[20:44:33] <fuf> Hello. I try to install bitcoin-0.18.1 on my Ubuntu. I have this error: "configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missing, Bitcoin Core requires this library for wallet functionality (--disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)" How to fix it?
[20:45:58] *** Joins: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy)
[20:48:41] <ademan[m]> you can use `--with-incompatible-bdb` when you configure it, just note that your wallet may not be portable to other bitcoin installations if you do that
[20:48:57] <phasmatodea> there are electrum forks for other coins, but electrum is for bitcoin only
[20:50:41] <fuf> With "--with-incompatible-bdb" I have the same error
[20:51:36] <ademan[m]> fuf: have you installed the requirements documented in docs/build-unix.md ?
[20:52:38] <ademan[m]> it's not super clear in the doc actually, but you want to install the libdb-dev and libdb++-dev packages to use with the --with-incompatible-bdb option

[20:58:17] <Victorsueca> IIRC the correct bdb version should be compiled at some point during the depends compile step
[21:00:23] <Victorsueca> meaning that if the depends were compiled correctly, you shouldn't need to pass `--with-incompatible-bdb`
[21:01:10] <Victorsueca> can someone confirm if that is still the case?
[21:01:14] <fuf> Yes, no error during compiling dependencies.

[21:11:53] <Guest98> "Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. Developers are improving the software but they can't force a change in the rules of the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software they use."
[21:12:31] <Guest98> I'm not so sure saying that "Developers are improving the software but they can't force a change in the rules of the Bitcoin protocol" is correct
[21:13:25] <Victorsueca> Guest98: they can't, applying any such change to the rules would require users to agree and put the new software into use
[21:13:38] <Guest98> since Gavin Adresen was removed from GitHub, changes to the Bitcoin protocol is forced on us by a few
[21:14:40] <Victorsueca> Guest98: GitHub is not a source of trust and repo owners alone can't enforce any changes in the protocol
[21:14:48] <ademan[m]> don't upgrade? use one of the scores of other bitcoin implementations?
[21:15:17] <Guest98> you can't run older clients today example bitcoind v0.8.1 : https://bitnodes.io/nodes/?q=Satoshi:0.8.1 they not supporting Blockstream introduced segwit or taproot
[21:15:47] <Guest98> the Bitcoin protocol indeed was changed forcefully
[21:16:13] <Victorsueca> Guest98: supporting SegWit or Taproot has never been a requirement to run software
[21:17:08] <Guest98> you have to support it regardless you using the so called "Bitcoin Core" or not otherwise you can't process the new blocks
[21:18:40] <Victorsueca> Guest98: you can process them, you're just missing some info about signatures required for proper validation
[21:19:04] <Guest98> no matter how I try to run the oldest node, it is not working, I'm forced to use Bitcoin Core with segwit. This what I call "forced change in the Bitcoin protocol".

[21:30:26] <Victorsueca> Friendly reminder that pretty much everyone agreed with implementing SegWit since it was proposed and even then all developers around the world had a really tough time pushing it through only because a small group of miners decided they didn't want the change to be made because it broke the magic on their ASICs that were using a quirk in dsha256 to gain more efficiency.
