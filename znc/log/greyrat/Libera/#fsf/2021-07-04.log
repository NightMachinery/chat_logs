[00:37:38] <Baobab> Quick question:
[00:37:46] <Baobab> I don't know if this is too offtopic, but is this tweet correct in that github copilot is violating gpl? https://nitter.snopyta.org/eevee/status/1410037309848752128
[00:38:08] <Baobab> And if it doesn't violate the gpl, would adding say a machine learning exception to the gpl make the license nonfree?
[00:39:15] <Noisytoot> exceptions can't make it nonfree, they can only make it more permissive
[00:40:05] <Baobab> wait, I think I phrased it wrong.
[00:41:14] <dstolfa> Baobab: none of this has been tested in court and i'm not aware of any lawyers here, so the most you'll get is armchair lawyering. to chime in, no, i don't think this is acceptable and i think it is a violation -- not only of the GPL, but copyright as well

[00:42:41] <dstolfa> the only thing you can do is stop using proprietary platforms such as github to avoid this
[00:43:27] <yrk> what they are developing is a product to sell to big corporations. and they are using the community as guinea pigs (no offence meant to Cavia porcellus) to test it
[00:43:58] <yrk> they couldn't care less if it violates someone's rights; they know exactly who has the power

[22:07:14] <galex-713> and there is an increased will to unpatent these to end the pandemics
[22:08:05] <galex-713> root2: it’s 11ko, which is mostly the static linking of 3 “large” components already found in nature, and whose discovery was publicly documented, so nothing is copyrightable there
[22:08:30] <galex-713> when the patent will cease to be valid, it will very much be public domain
[22:09:33] <galex-713> also it is obvious moderna does such advertisement (and beware of advertisement, it is rarely wise and nuanciated), because their very name derives from what they tried to secretly invent 10 years ago as a new technology while it’s only a natural step for humankind (that’s why they initially wanted to keep it secret, because the idea is obvious, and what’s less obvious is our ability to implement it)
[22:09:56] <galex-713> so such advertisement is effective to promote them in comparison to any other company like pfizer

[22:16:26] <galex-713> a separate issue, and anyway patent law is a heeeell less longterm-sided than copyright law: patents only last 20 years (and you most likely live more than that time), while copyright law lasts for more than an average lifetime (from 70 to 150 years after author’s death or oper’s creation, depending of the cases)

[22:38:23] <root2> true. to correct myself, it's not even uracil, it was replaced with 1-methyl-3'-pseudouridylyl so the body does not reject the mRNA as foreign. According to berthub.eu, it should be denoted with a (unicode following) Ψ.

[22:56:45] <root2> I also saw LyX (http://www.lyx.org/), but never learned to use it. It seems simpler than LaTeX, because it's somewhat WYSIWYG and still contains most features of a LaTeX distribution.
[23:01:50] *** Joins: RedSoxFan07 (~Thunderbi@d-159-250-218-50.ct.cpe.atlanticbb.net)
[23:04:02] <galex-713> root2: LyX is a WYSIWYG interface to LaTeX
[23:04:46] <zleap> I started out with LyX
[23:06:08] * Noisytoot installs texlive
[23:06:13] <galex-713> it is really much used
[23:06:19] <Noisytoot> the Guix texlive-texmf substitute is 2.61GiB
[23:06:24] <galex-713> you can see that by looking at the sources of most articles on arXiv
[23:06:29] <galex-713> it’s unreadable
[23:06:36] <galex-713> Noisytoot: texlive is heavy, on all systems
[23:06:43] <galex-713> it’s around 2-3GiB on debian too
[23:06:55] <zleap> yeah
[23:06:56] <Noisytoot> what makes it so big?
[23:07:07] <galex-713> most likely because it involves a loooot of uncompressed text and many many many documentation PDFs
[23:07:08] <zleap> it has packages, software, documentation
[23:07:13] <galex-713> and pdf is somewhat heavy
[23:07:27] <galex-713> zleap: packages are software + documentation, and TeX software is plain-text
[23:07:34] <zleap> yeah
[23:07:46] <zleap> but there is a lot of stuff on texlive / ctan
[23:07:53] <galex-713> yes a hell lot
[23:07:57] <root2> ALL packages from CTAN are in there, right? Unlike CPAN and PIP where packages are installed when needed.
[23:07:57] <Noisytoot> would it be quicker to disable substitutes and compile from source?
[23:07:59] <galex-713> “almost everything”
[23:08:13] <Noisytoot> root2, CTAN has some nonfree packages, so not everything
[23:08:14] <galex-713> I mean you download those gigs and you got everything you mean need for the next decade
[23:08:27] <galex-713> Noisytoot: there is no compilation
[23:08:28] <Noisytoot> (like the TeXbook/METAFONTbook)
[23:08:39] <root2> AFAIK it's advised to use the install-tl script from texlive website instead of the distribution package.
[23:08:40] <Noisytoot> galex-713, the PDFs are compiled from something
[23:08:49] <galex-713> without substitute, the “source” would be a shell script that would manually download everything from CTAN instead of guix
[23:08:53] <galex-713> Noisytoot: oh right!
[23:09:08] <root2> The documentation is not always PDF, it may just as well be a text file, markdown or HTML
[23:09:10] <galex-713> so I guess not, but depending on your connection
[23:09:22] <Noisytoot> root2, TeX documentation is PDF
[23:09:43] *** Joins: Haaninjo (~anders@fsf/member/Haaninjo)
[23:09:53] <root2> I meant documentation for individual CTAN packages.
[23:09:58] <Noisytoot> I think TeX is older than markdown (and it's a typesetting system, so it would make sense for its documentation to be written in itself)
[23:10:10] <Noisytoot> texdoc usually opens a PDF
[23:10:11] <root2> Of course
[23:10:46] <galex-713> yes
[23:11:07] <galex-713> Noisytoot: more than that: tex usually follows Knuth’s way of litterate programming: documentation and implementation are interwined, I think
[23:11:13] <galex-713> in the documentation you often have samples of code
[23:11:22] <galex-713> and not examples, but rather definitions
[23:11:38] <Noisytoot> How is TeX bootstrapped?
[23:11:49] <Noisytoot> There must be some way to compile TeX without TeX
[23:12:19] <galex-713> Noisytoot: TeX is written in C, it’s an interpreter
[23:12:27] <galex-713> originally in pascal, but it has been translated
[23:12:33] <galex-713> pdflatex is C
[23:12:42] <galex-713> it’s not written in itself
[23:12:45] <Noisytoot> galex-713, but it's literate C
[23:13:01] <Noisytoot> you need a program to seperate the C from the TeX
[23:13:12] <galex-713> Noisytoot: with another C tool… oh ok I see what you mean
[23:13:12] <galex-713> damn I forgot
[23:13:26] <galex-713> I think they include the separated C source file to bootstrap it
[23:13:33] <galex-713> it would make more sense
