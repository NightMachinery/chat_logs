[14:28:19] <saganman> is that zen Budhist centre?
[14:28:22] <amigojapan> fragrantica: it allows stereoscopic vision. And if we lose one eye we still have a backup
[14:28:58] <fragrantica> I guess that is a benefit
[14:29:04] <saganman> We would have better eyes if we had evolved from land creatures instead of fish

[16:29:32] <shirafuno> Publios, Yeah i've had three CBT therapists so far. Teaching me breathing exercises and such. But it's so hard when you're in the thick of it. My anxiety is around my health and they always say "Whats the worst that could happen?"to which i reply "I could die!". It's harder because i'm not some guy who turns lights on and off 15 times out of fear his loved ones will come to harm.

[16:30:26] <shirafuno> my self-preservation is just out of control to the point it stops me living a life.

[16:31:05] <Publios> the ebola outbreak in 2014 was hard for me

[16:31:34] <lastonestanding> or is it?
[16:31:39] <Roey> I ain't done anything special during ebola
[16:31:40] <Publios> ebola is very deadly
[16:31:59] <Publios> ebola is so deadly it isn't a good virus
[16:32:00] <lastonestanding> 100% or close to it?
[16:32:00] <Publios> lol
[16:32:00] <Roey> china virus had more of an impact on my day-to-day life, obviously

[16:32:58] <Publios> Roey,  well yeah, it is far far more contagious

[16:33:06] <Publios> malaria isn't a virus
[16:33:24] <lastonestanding> it's a mosquitoe? 
[16:33:31] <HubertFarnsworth> Lol
[16:33:34] <Publios> I think it is actually a parasite
[16:33:39] <lastonestanding> eww
[16:33:39] <Publios> carried by mosquitos
[16:33:47] <lastonestanding> you mean it's a tiny worm?
[16:33:51] <HubertFarnsworth> You forgot polio
[16:34:57] <Publios> shirafuno,  honestly, I found a lot of solace in playing the percentages via logic. you are 27, the only thing to likely kill you is a car accident. until you hit about 55 or so you needen't really worry about major healthscares until you get badly sick. sure, you could be the 1 and 10 million brain tumor person but it is so u nlikely worrying about it is just stupid
[16:35:17] <AnnaTokoroni> it's not a worm, it's a single celled plasmodium
[16:35:19] <Publios> that's how I got over that type stuff
[16:35:42] <lastonestanding> so, more like a amoeba?
[16:35:47] <Publios> yeah
[16:36:27] <lastonestanding> I wonder if amoebas are living inside our bodies
[16:36:35] <Publios> likely
[16:36:36] <Publios> idk tho
[16:36:50] <lastonestanding> I know about bacterias in our stomach 
[16:36:59] <lastonestanding> they just live there
[16:37:04] <lastonestanding> pretty weird
[16:37:15] <Publios> they actually are a key to our digestive processes
[16:37:34] <lastonestanding> did we create them?
[16:37:38] <AnnaTokoroni> things go bad if you try to kill them off
[16:38:00] <lastonestanding> like, do we give birth to bacteria?
[16:38:09] <lastonestanding> or does bacteria come from outside?
[16:38:17] <Roey> you know what would really suck
[16:38:20] <Roey> to get HIV from a mosquito bite.
[16:38:21] <AnnaTokoroni> from outside
[16:38:31] <lastonestanding> interesting
[16:38:34] <Publios> Roey,  probably hard
[16:38:38] <Roey> mayhaps
[16:39:53] <lastonestanding> now that I think about it... how can our body work as a system so beautifully?
[16:39:55] <AnnaTokoroni> there are remains of viruses and bacteria in our dna, but those parts are jumbled up and not functional, so you can't just start making your own bacteria
[16:40:02] <lastonestanding> it's a very complex system with many atoms

[18:21:59] <BillyZane> anything good this season?
[18:22:10] <SpiritOfSummer> hi amigojapan
[18:22:54] <amigojapan> Hi SpiritOfSummer 
[18:23:13] <BillyZane> ohhh... looks like awe got a harem anime: kanojo mo kanojo
[18:23:58] <amigojapan> BillyZane: I hardly watch any modern anime that is why I ask watching konosuba, and it is one of the most modern I have watched
[18:24:35] <BillyZane> amigojapan, i like seeing modern ones
[18:24:48] <BillyZane> amigojapan, the newer the better. dunno why. it's like opening a christmas present
[18:25:03] <amigojapan> BillyZane: have you watched all the classics yet?
[18:25:13] <BillyZane> every season is like "i wonder what they'll make this time." and you get to watch it while it's airing. years later, it will be considered old
[18:25:32] <BillyZane> amigojapan, i've seen quite a lot, i doubt it
[18:26:00] <BillyZane> amigojapan, do you watch currently airing anime?
[18:26:16] <Sadale> BillyZane, lol that pic's funny
[18:26:16] <amigojapan> BillyZane: watching modern anime means filtering out the garbage once too
[18:26:20] <BillyZane> i doubt you do based on what you said earlier
[18:26:25] <BillyZane> Sadale, hahah, ikr. that anime is hilarious
[18:26:33] <amigojapan> BillyZane: very rarely
[18:26:35] <Sadale> yuriempire huh?
[18:26:39] <BillyZane> Sadale, it's really over the top. i recommend it cause it's so funny at times
[18:26:45] <Sadale> cool! :3
[18:27:19] <Sadale> BillyZane, what's the name of that anime tho? At first I thought that it was yuri empire. Then I looked into it, nope
[18:27:33] <BillyZane> amigojapan, a funny thing about anime that's currently airing is you associate everything by season, and you think, "that's the season i watched those 3 animes." and you associate them together. a very good 'season' will have a lot of great anime
[18:27:45] <BillyZane> Sadale, valkyrie drive: mermaid
[18:28:41] <amigojapan> BillyZane: I rather only watch the good ones that have "passed the test of time
[18:28:51] <BillyZane> Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki looks pretty good

[19:56:33] <amigojapan> BillyZane: yeah. They were not that good
[19:56:43] <BillyZane> amigojapan, have you seen 'outlaw star'

[19:57:41] <amigojapan> I see BillyZane 
[19:57:49] <Bco1981> but if people could look past the ecchi harem, the anime actually is a show about disabilities or trying to be different and fit in.

[21:11:31] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: by the way. I watched 4 episodes of konosuba today. And tomako e was cracking up by just listening to it
[21:11:42] <beaky> nice do you like aqua-sama
[21:11:48] * amigojapan clicks
[21:12:03] <TsundereNoises> beaky: FREEDOM SMILE
[21:12:08] <Bco1981> amigojapan: nice, konosuba is funny.
[21:12:24] <Bco1981> i can't remember how many times i have rewatched that.
[21:12:25] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: IMO the 1st season is much better than the 2nd
[21:12:32] <Bco1981> and i still laugh at it.
[21:12:32] <beaky> subaru is kawaii
[21:13:42] <Bco1981> lol, i get it. i get why we don't see yagoo doing collabs.
[21:13:53] <SpiritOfSummer> not one where the people are happy anyway
[21:13:57] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises well I only am 4 episodes in
[21:14:12] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean I think it's funny, I just thought quality dropped off after a while, but form your own opinion
[21:14:13] <amigojapan> Bco1981: yeah tomako sure seemed to think so
[21:14:14] <SpiritOfSummer> wrong channel. 
[21:14:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm happy to talk about it though
[21:14:59] <beaky> coco x yagoo the only colab
[21:15:09] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: thanks
[21:15:48] <amigojapan> beaky: I hope Coco Congress back soon. I feel like I lost someone important in my life
[21:15:48] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: the video I linked is subaru, who I think you'd like, interviewing a bunch of others, including a lot I listed, for their "crimes", let me know if you think it's funny
[21:16:18] <amigojapan> Ok TsundereNoises 
[21:16:20] <TsundereNoises> I think coco is scheduled to return in 5000 years or so, right?
[21:16:24] <beaky> the crime of being too cute 
[21:16:39] <TsundereNoises> beaky: yes, most of hololive are guilty of that
[21:17:07] <Bco1981> beaky: he might be okay if it's on the official hololive channel... i can see it now, doing a AR 3D collab, so he really stands in the same room as the girls.
[21:17:50] <beaky> 3d person juxtaposed with 2d girls 
[21:18:16] <Bco1981> the girls in 3d, and him like a real human in there with them.
[21:18:48] <beaky> do they get to bully him
[21:18:58] <Bco1981> coco does...
[21:19:06] <TsundereNoises> I'm sure they'd all bully him
[21:19:14] <Bco1981> he likes it

[21:19:49] <Bco1981> lol

[21:21:59] <amigojapan> Yeah
[21:22:03] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: she speaks a tiny bit of spanish, but I doubt that had anything to do with her name
[21:22:19] <amigojapan> I see
[21:22:22] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: by speaks spanish I mean like put a few hours into failing at duolingo
