[06:17:28] <noex> or even use a separate application as a backend, but render pages in qutebrowser.  that would be incredible.
[06:22:15] <shadow53> I believe they have proxy applications you can use for this. Don't know any off the top of my head, though

[07:36:39] <giusb> noex: I actually wrote a qutebrowser gemini plugin a while ago
[07:38:15] <giusb> You can find at https://github.com/pinusc/qutebrowser
[07:38:20] <giusb> There's a branch called feature-gemini
[07:39:57] <giusb> s/plugin/fork, really. Although it's decoupled enough from the rest of the codebase that it probably *could* be just loaded in config.py but I couldn't be bothered to figure out how. If you plan on using it I can try and update the branch tomorrow
[07:50:05] <noex> giusb: that's awesome. yeah, it looks like the userscripts that ship with qutebrowser are similar. i don't know enough about how they work either tbh
[07:50:28] <giusb> Oh, I didn't realize there's now gemini userscripts

[07:51:23] <giusb> I think my fork probably has the advantage of being able to just handle gemini:// urls seamlessly, and hence also links within gemini pages
[07:53:52] <noex> i wish i knew anything about the codebase, that would be the coolest add-on ever though.
[07:54:31] <giusb> noex: I don't see any userscripts for gemini even in the current repo
[07:54:49] <noex> there aren't
[07:54:55] <noex> but this should totally be a thing
[07:55:07] <giusb> Ooh okay, I see
[07:55:16] <giusb> Well, for now you can try my fork if you'd like
[07:55:48] <giusb> I might go back and make it into a more easily loadable thing that doesn't require switching codebases
[07:55:59] <noex> i'd prefer not to use a fork long-term, but I'm happy to try it
[07:56:19] <noex> curious what The-Compiler thinks about this and the feasibility of it

[08:02:54] <noex> as far as I can tell, there is not a single mainstream browser that supports it. the best you can do is proxy or use a third party application.
[08:05:25] <noex> giusb: can you seamlessly go in between the http and gemini links here? https://drewdevault.com/
[08:07:13] <noex> by default following a gemini link appears to do nothing. not sure if that gets passed to xdg-open or what happens.

[08:14:24] <giusb> Of note: there is an added pip dependency, "ignition". If you didn't install it then it's not gonna work
[08:17:35] <giusb> Huh, that's really funny. Following gemini:// links within gemini pages works, but not from http pages. There must be something else going on that I didn't account for...

[09:35:47] <jiewawa> config.bind('M', 'hint links spawn http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8889 mpv {hint-url}')
[09:36:42] <jiewawa> I get the following error in qutebrowser

[09:36:51] <jiewawa> (Hint: Make sure 'http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8889' exists and is executable)
[09:37:46] <jiewawa> I guess that launching it from a shell script is the way to go, but when I try that it doesn't pick up the proxy settings for some reason
[09:43:11] <giusb> jiewawa: have you tried using sh -c "export http_proxy=whatever; mpv {hint-url}" as the command?
[09:43:49] <giusb> tbf export might not be necessary, maybe sh -c http_proxy=whatever mpv {hint-url}"
[09:45:39] <giusb> Sorry, missed a quote in the last example. sh -c "http_proxy=whatever mpv {hint-url}"

[10:06:01] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: Hi, did you see my message about Qutebrowser having the error message 'Renderer process crashed (status 11)' on Alpine aarch64 when opening youtube.com? (The debug log is in that message, about 20 hours ago, I've lost the link to it because my IRC client closed). Thanks!
[10:06:44] <The-Compiler> ktprograms: yes, IIRC I asked a question earlier and didn't get an answer
[10:07:12] <ktprograms> ktprograms: Sorry, I guess I was asleep. What was your question?

[10:08:15] <The-Compiler> Ah, you did answer
[10:08:41] <The-Compiler> Well, next step would be to use a debugger I guess, will explain later
[10:10:09] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: I'm guessing I'll have to build qt5-qtwebengine with debug symbols? If so I'd better start that first.
[10:10:49] <The-Compiler> ktprograms: maybe you'll see something useful without debug symbols, but yeah, it'd most likely help
