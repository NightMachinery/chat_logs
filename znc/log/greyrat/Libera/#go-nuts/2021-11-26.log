[00:10:36] <mickey8> well, nice idea, but im not very sure. it shows up once in the devtools of the browser
[00:10:53] <mickey8> and there's nothing in the code that im aware of that could be redirecting the user around

[01:57:06] <haniaF> hi, i wanted to ask about global variables. for some reason, i shriggle every time seeing them. are they considered as a bad practice in go? considering this code i wrote https://pastebin.com/G5BUx6RU should I declare channel vars in main function and pass them around functions or are they just fine being global vars?
[01:58:56] <rawtaz> sorry but this was pasted in another channel while discussing Go, and i just gotta show it :P  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OdUpuRXX/external-content.duckduckgo.com.png
[01:58:58] <b0nn> Globals are bad practice, yes; they're not threadsafe, and make maintenance difficult (where the hang is /that/ being changed/
[01:59:10] <neiluj> basically I try to create a new file with: os.Create("/home/neiluj/dfs/README.text") but it returns the error: open /home/jco/dfs/README.text: invalid argument which is confusing to me

[02:13:27] <DHowett> neiluj: your first port of call is going to be that goroutine that's "running" (so, the first 20 lines or so)
[02:13:32] <rawtaz> the first one says "running" so i suppose that is what the message is from
[02:13:38] <rawtaz> this is probably documented somewhere
[02:14:06] <rawtaz> neiluj: sounds like you have multiple things writing to the same map? :)
[02:14:39] <DHowett> the top line is usually going to be the direct thing that caused the abort (in this case, a "throw" from the runtime). after that, the next 2-4 entries are likely to be your code; look for the lines starting with /home/ or wherever your application source is
[02:14:43] <DHowett> rawtaz likely has it ;P
[02:14:55] <haniaF> b0nn multiple functions need to share the same channel for the purpose of rate limiting. as it's completely irrelevant to what they do, and effectively to the API user, I wanted at all cost to hide this implementation detail and additional responsibility from user

[02:19:30] <b0nn> If you are writing a client, you say "I have this client, and it will make this number of calls per second, and it then decides if to call or not, not the functions

[02:30:47] <haniaF> but still, if i build something on top of that
[02:30:58] <b0nn> meh why even ask
[02:31:06] <b0nn> just go byuild your tyre fire
[02:31:11] <haniaF> there's still a question on how to handle channels or other synchronization mechanisms
[02:34:34] <haniaF> i ask because i don't want to make stupid mistakes right at the beginning of building the project. given my little-to-0 experience with go, i guess it should be understandable i have multiple doubts. had you even just looked at sample I provided, it could've been much easier explaining what do i want to achieve.
[02:35:05] <rawtaz> neiluj: if i were you i'd create just a simple basic program with just os.Create(..) in the main() and verify i can reproduce the problem with that, and then strace that. much much sompler to deal with

[10:37:33] <mikoto-chan> nitrix: was thinking about this too but it doesn't meet the function signature conditions ...

[10:38:04] <mikoto-chan> either I'm terrible at programming or there is something seriously wrong with these exercises
[10:39:33] <nitrix> It has to be that signature to match the criteria for the type to be an io.Writer.
[10:40:19] <nitrix> Reader and Writer are probably the first two interfaces people run into when learning Go. I'd say the tutorial isn't helping you much if it got that wrong.

[10:56:46] <fub> My code is connecting to a websocket feed which sends a lot of "entries" to me. I want to process this entries in different workers, which themselfes should limit their concurrency. I have the feeling that this can be a problem because if a worker is not fast enough, sending the entries to the channels of this workers can block if they are not free, so the entries from the websocket feed will queue up.
[10:57:20] <fub> I have two thoughts now how to solve this: a) send each entry in a goroutine to the channel b) use some pubsub mechanism like https://gocloud.dev/howto/pubsub/ with the mempubsub module.
[10:57:24] <fub> Any thoughts on this?

[14:50:52] <dalan> `output` is ending up as an oversized array of copies of the the largest value from input. I think I'm overwriting the pointer at some point? I can see the permutations being generated in the interim but I'm confused as to what's happening. Let me try and get it working in go.dev play
[14:50:57] <fizzie> You would seem to be appending the *same* slice (`data`) to `output` over and over again, rather than making a copy.

[14:53:49] <dalan> Indeed
[14:56:02] <dalan> Thanks fizzie
[14:57:49] <dalan> fizzie why not use `copy`?
[14:58:46] <fizzie> You can. It just takes an extra line or two to make + copy compared to using append. You can fairly argue it'd be more clear what it's doing with copy.
[14:59:28] <dalan> Rodger rodger, just wanted to validate there wasn't any particular reason not to use `copy`

[15:06:38] <fizzie> Why would it be? It's the exact same operation.
[15:07:56] <A_Dragon> fizzie: backing array size
[15:08:21] <A_Dragon> append will double and copy repeatedly whereas if you make() a slice of the right size first time, copy wont (or append, to be fair)
[15:08:59] <fizzie> Okay, that might be what it's doing, but there's definitely no _need_ for it to do that.
[15:09:09] <A_Dragon> no not at all
[15:09:16] <A_Dragon> just a consequence of how append works internally
[15:09:52] <A_Dragon> in general when append hits the end of the slice its adding to, it will allocate a new array twice the size of the existing one, copy the original data into the new array, and then continue adding the new data
[15:10:45] <A_Dragon> so while the append() to copy fun does work, and is nice and concise, it can be a performance problem, depending on the slice sizes involved
[15:11:07] <A_Dragon> if I have a 2048 byte slice, appending that to a []byte(nil) will be far slower than a copy
[15:11:09] <A_Dragon> in fact!
[15:11:11] <A_Dragon> lets bench this
[15:11:28] <fizzie> There's just one copy.

[15:12:46] <fizzie> At least in the version of the code I landed randomly, can't quite find where the equivalent is in current versions.
[15:13:11] <fizzie> But https://github.com/golang/go/blob/037ac2bd8/src/cmd/compile/internal/gc/walk.go#L2571-2584 says `append(l1, l2...)` expands into a single memmove.
[15:13:51] <fizzie> The resulting array might end up larger than it needs to, from `growslice`, but it still won't be making more than one copy operation of the data.

[22:48:20] <b0nn> flughafen: have you checked if it's a versioning problem

[22:59:22] <b0nn> honestly, though, these problems would be better solved by a red hat person, not a go person

[23:00:05] <b0nn> so, I think you will need to have a foot in two camps (one here, one in a red hat/linux channel) as you figure this out
