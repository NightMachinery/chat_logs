[01:04:39] <ericonr> Alipha: rejecting if time is outside the window, and hadn't thought of storing the nonces. That's a nice idea!
[01:10:04] <ericonr> Can just write a ring buffer for them, I suppose 
[01:11:02] <riv> it's fine to randomly generate nonces, as long as they have enough bits the chance of collision is the same as the chance of an attacker just guessing your key

[01:23:52] <Alipha> ericonr: sequential nonces may be a little more efficient, as you'd store for each of the last 50 or whatnot whether you've already received it in a ring buffer. Then you don't necessarily need a time field (or worry about keeping it in sync with the server) because you'd just reject anything older than 50 nonces ago. And then you don't have to worry about nonce collisions, as riv pointed out

[01:55:21] <ericonr> Alipha: I might combine your idea with cehteh's... Keeping fully sequential nonce could be a pain because it would mean saving state when the application exists, afaik?
[01:56:04] <ericonr> Or did you just mean random nonce generation + then increment that value 
[02:00:00] *** Quits: jtgd (~jay@user/jtgd) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:04:24] <Alipha> ericonr: yeah, you could do that, if the nonce is big enough. What about deriving a nee key per "session"? Something simple like `session_key = HMAC(master_key, randomness)`
[02:04:33] <Alipha> *new
[02:05:19] <ericonr> How could I handshake for a session key?
[02:05:25] <cehteh> how big is the nonce, how much do you need as in frequnecy over time, how costly is pure random in that app
[02:05:40] <ericonr> Transmit randomness in plain text?
[02:05:50] <cehteh> i mean for any reasonable big enough nonce you can just use randoms and call it a day
[02:06:12] <ericonr> cehteh: the idea of tracking nonces would be avoiding replay attacks!
[02:06:24] <ericonr> (since it's a pre-shared key)
[02:06:24] <cehteh> my suggestion would be nice when you as well need some monotonically increasing seqence number
[02:07:18] *** Joins: rundown (~eb0t@2a02:c7d:f20e:ed00:216:44ff:fe6a:c888)
[02:07:32] <cehteh> for that you want some sequence number
[02:07:39] <cehteh> and can make it part of the nonce
[02:08:26] <cehteh> starting with a random and incrementing it would do as well, the nonce isnt a secret right

[02:13:40] <ericonr> cehteh: nonce isn't secret, no. Using a session key with randomness provided by the server + nonce as sequence key sounds quite viable!
[02:14:23] <ericonr> So, how could I transmit randomness to clients? Should it be plaintext or encrypted with the secret key?
[02:14:57] <cehteh> have you considered to use some modern approach like ratchet or noise?
[02:15:46] <ericonr> Well, this was supposed to be a simple protocol for extra brownie points on an unrelated assignment :p
[02:16:02] <Alipha> ericonr: handshake for session key would be one side sending "randomness || timestamp" signed with the master_key? And the other side verifying the timestamp is reasonable to prevent replays?
[02:16:14] <cehteh> noise is iirc pretty simple to implement
[02:17:44] <Alipha> ericonr: though I suppose it's simpler to not bother with the handshake and just use an algorithm with large nonces (ie, xsalsa20 or xchacha20)
[02:18:27] <ericonr> The handshake might be cool to implement, so there's a chance I will do it anyway :p

[07:35:05] <Wulf> I've been running my own mailserver for many years now. Only real problem I had was when I moved it to a new hoster and got a new IP address which was considered not trustworthy at first. But sorted that out too.
[07:35:37] <Wulf> I don't have any spam filter and I hardly get any spam. Perhaps a spam mail every few Months.
[07:36:52] <snappy> Yeah I ran my own mailserver for about a decade and didn't really have sendability issues.
[07:36:57] <OpenSores> Wulf: hi
[07:37:19] <Wulf> OpenSores: Hello.
[07:37:20] <snappy> I migrated to a paid mail hosting provider simply because they're better at backups and disaster recovery.

[07:37:38] <OpenSores> Would you have any idea about my dovecot issue by any off chance?
[07:38:32] <Wulf> OpenSores: nope. Has been many years since I played around with sieve-filter.
[07:38:38] <OpenSores> snappy: that's true. But I'm a poor college student living on grants and I cannot afford email hosting.
[07:38:46] <OpenSores> Thanks for looking!

[07:44:33] <Wulf> OpenSores: email hosting might actually be cheaper than hosting yourself.
[07:44:43] *** Joins: gggp (~gggp@li870-78.members.linode.com)
[07:44:57] <Wulf> unless you host at home on your raspi, but that's quite unreliable.
[07:45:07] <OpenSores> I pay $6 for the VPS
[07:45:29] <OpenSores> I get 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 1TB Traffic, and 32GB SSD

[07:46:26] <OpenSores> On this, I host everything, over a dozen domains, static sites, some php stuff, irc, radio station, email server (dozens of email boxes for every domain)
[07:46:29] <Wulf> OpenSores: yep. And cheap email package (including domain) costs ~ 2-3$.

[07:46:37] <OpenSores> For how many domains?
[07:46:40] <Wulf> 1 :)
[07:46:45] <OpenSores> :)
[07:46:58] <OpenSores> Times that by dozens of domains I have, $1 per user per domain is the email hosting cost usualy.
[07:47:00] <OpenSores> hosted email.
[07:47:11] <OpenSores> So if you have 100 boxes, that's min $100 usd

[07:51:37] <OpenSores> There is no enforced restriction of domains number on the Micro plan. However, if you do have a significant number of domains, we will raise eyebrows and may ask you to upgrade plan.
[07:51:42] <OpenSores> $18/year I can afford.
[07:53:24] <OpenSores> I might check this out
[07:53:58] <OpenSores> I will send them an email, tell my domains, # of emails I send, basically rarely, but mostly get emails, and need someone to handle spam for me. I have been battling spam for 12 years. I am tired.
