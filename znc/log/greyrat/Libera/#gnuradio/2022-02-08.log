[02:30:14] <duude__> Is there a simpler way of doing this on a larger scale?
[02:30:37] <duude__> Or is just a ton of multiply blocks the answer lol
[02:30:44] <duude__> (Like.. let's say 20 siginal sources)
[02:36:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> What are you actually trying to achieve?
[02:39:39] <duude__> patchvonbraun: combine multiple signal sources
[02:40:35] <duude__> oh nvm i could just do add for all 3
[02:40:39] <duude__> lol
[02:40:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> So that you have multiple tones in a single signal?  You can just add them all
[02:40:42] <duude__> that was dumb
[02:40:45] <duude__> yea
[02:40:54] <duude__> thanks
[02:40:56] <duude__> :D
[02:41:04] <patchvonbraun[m]> If they're going to an actual radio, make their amplitude 1/N
[02:41:14] <duude__> just learning the basics for now

[12:51:53] <ahmad_sho[m]> Hi, I trying to work with MIMO on GRC, so I wanted to use the libraries included here:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/6150c54a791b75151b41f93768c3109f64c22909)
[12:52:39] <ahmad_sho[m]> yet I had the following error: 
[12:52:39] <ahmad_sho[m]> CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:450 (message):
[12:52:39] <ahmad_sho[m]>   VOLK required but not found.
[12:53:40] <ahmad_sho[m]> Or is there a way to include the added MIMO blocks to the existing gnuradio install?
[12:59:47] <drmpeg> You have to load the Volk submodule.
[13:00:32] <drmpeg> git submodule update --init
[13:01:51] <drmpeg> Be aware that's an old version of GNU Radio.
[13:02:03] <drmpeg> 3.7.12.0
[13:04:46] <drmpeg> Possibly the worst way to have blocks for others to use.
[13:06:31] <ahmad_sho[m]> my goal is to implement some MIMO applications. Is there any other way (without having to code the blocks myself, Not my priority at this point)?
[13:06:54] <MubashiraZaman[m> <muaddib[m]> "the object type may have changed..." <- nvm, i solved that
[13:07:00] <MubashiraZaman[m> I have another question.
[13:08:40] <MubashiraZaman[m> What is the difference between FEC Encoder, FEC Tagged Encoder, FEC Extended Encoder and FEC Extended Tagged Encoder?
[13:09:22] <drmpeg> ahmad_sho[m] There are many ways to do MIMO. What exactly do you want to do?
[13:13:14] <drmpeg> If you're just looking for anything, there's a MISO transmitter in GNU Radio. It implements the DVB-T2 MISO standard.
[13:14:14] <drmpeg> <install_dir>/share/gnuradio/examples/dtv/vv018-miso.grc
[13:14:43] <ahmad_sho[m]> currently, I'm trying to implement simple MIMO examples, like zero-forcing, with 2 receivers. Ultimately We would like to manage a complete MIMO platform (multiple RIOs, octoclocks, FPGA cards,...) with gnuradio if possible. I'm using the simple examples on a small test bench that I have as a learning track.
[13:19:02] <drmpeg> I don't think you're going to get very far without coding custom blocks.
[13:27:23] <ahmad_sho[m]> I would eventually. I wanted to see if it was possible to get basic applications running first. I'm starting based on the suggestion I got here from willcode4 yesterday.

[18:54:55] <tcarls[m]> Ugh; had a thinko in one of my .block.yml files that caused a not-so-easy-to-interpret error message (`dtype: in` where a message-domain input should have had `id: in`, leading to a message "Insufficient connected input ports")
[18:57:34] <tcarls[m]> ...wait, no, that wasn't it; corrected that, still seeing that error.
[18:58:35] <Zero_Chaos> I'm using trunk-recorder to monitor a bunch of radio traffic near me.  Everything sounds great with 8 rtlsdrs hooked up, but as soon as I add a 9th, everything sounds like trash.  I can't figure out why though.  Not cpu temp, cpu utilization, ram utilization, or usb io (afaict).  I am pushing about 29000 kb/s according to usbtop which seems pretty reasonable to me?  If it was sample underrun doesn't 
[18:58:41] <Zero_Chaos> that show up as UUUUUUUU?
[19:04:43] <tnt> Zero_Chaos: it wouldn't show up no.
[19:05:05] <tnt> Only USRP report overflows/underflow.
[19:05:26] <tnt> The rtl-sdr don't repot anything, there is no hw support for it, so ... you just start getting garbage.
[19:05:26] <Zero_Chaos> so if I burn cpu hard I get 'OOOOOOOOOOO' in the terminal
[19:06:03] <Zero_Chaos> so overflow shows for sure, but no underflow reporting?  I would figure "I'm not getting as much data as I requested" would be instrumented, no?
[19:06:46] <Zero_Chaos> also, I've continued to tune the sample rates down to the minimum needed and it's cleaner, so I'm pretty certain you are correct, it just seems odd to not instrument that
[19:06:51] <tnt> Heh, those 'O' are not hw overflows.
[19:07:33] <Zero_Chaos> O is overflow, no? as in gr is getting data faster than it can parse it
[19:08:02] <tnt> yeah, but not hw overflow. Just the USB loop received data and didn't have any GR buffer to put them in.
[19:08:37] <tnt> But if inside the hw an overflow occured because the host didn't setup any transfers in time, you'll never know about it.
[19:08:42] <Zero_Chaos> yeah, it's not a hardware overflow, it's a software overflow, I get it.  but in the same way, I'd expect software underflows to be detected
[19:09:02] <tnt> Underflow is only a TX thing.
[19:09:10] <tnt> when sending data to a hw.
[19:09:40] <Zero_Chaos> not getting the amount of data you expect must badly mess up the flow graph.  so if I request 2MSPS and get 1 MSPS that would be problematic for everything but an fft, right?
[19:10:09] <tnt> GR doesn't use "real time" or "wall time" anywhere ...
[19:10:24] <tnt> (pretty much)
[19:10:36] <Zero_Chaos> right but the incoming signal dropping a bunch of samples must make decoding it rather awful
[19:10:43] <tnt> well yeah.
[19:10:54] <patchvonbraun[m]> GR deals in streams.  The notion of "sample rate" is an artifice that becomes important at the edges, where the hardware is, and for calculating things like filter parameters.
[19:11:24] <Zero_Chaos> so detecting that I'm getting a different number of samples than requested and thus something bad is happening seems like it's worth trying to catch
[19:11:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> The RTL-SDR drops samples silently and internally above a sample rate of 2.56Msps.
[19:11:58] <Zero_Chaos> (again, I know this is all self inflicted etc etc, I'm not tossing blame)
[19:12:07] <muaddib[m]> Have you disabled USB autosuspend and set your freq scaling to ‘performance’?
[19:12:27] <tnt> Feel free to try and write something, but there is so much dependency on the scheduler that trying to "measure" what you receive is _very_ _very_ imprecise.
[19:12:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> Whether that affects demodulation noticably kinda depends on the ratio between the final sample rate and the input sample rate.
[19:12:41] <Zero_Chaos> muaddib[m]: I have not disabled autosuspend but that's a great idea.  the cpu isn't being taxed (much)
[19:15:38] <Zero_Chaos> is ~30000 kb/s asking too much of usb2 with 9 devices?
[19:15:53] <Zero_Chaos> or am I hitting some other kind of limit than raw transfer?
[19:16:21] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, could you try hooking up that next RTLSDR to a different USB-Port / Bus?
[19:16:38] <Zero_Chaos> 9 rtl on a 10 port hub into a tb3 dock that has a dedicated usb controller
[19:16:59] <Zero_Chaos> Yamakaja[m]: I was thinking of that as a test, I just didn't know if there might be a way to measure what's causing my failure now.
[19:17:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> Zero_Chaos: Could be a power issue.  They're power-hungry
[19:17:36] <Zero_Chaos> patchvonbraun[m]: it's a high end powered hub, but power can always be an issue so that's a fair point.
[19:18:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also, 30MByte/second * 9 = 270MByte/second which is far beyond what a single USB2 hub can handle.
[19:18:47] <Zero_Chaos> there is noticably better performance now that I've dropped the rates to the minimum I need, so I suspect it's dropping samples and that's the correct diagnosis, just not sure why.  If it was power (for example) I wouldn't expect lowering the sample rates to matter at all.
[19:19:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> USB2 == 480Mbit/second
[19:20:04] <Zero_Chaos> patchvonbraun[m]: 30,000 kb/s isn't 30 MB/s, it's 30mb/s
[19:20:26] <Zero_Chaos> and it's 30 mb/s TOTAL, not per device
[19:20:36] <Zero_Chaos> (per usbtop)
[19:20:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Oh, I misread your statement.  Sorry.
[19:21:04] <Zero_Chaos> all good
[19:21:53] <Zero_Chaos> devices individually are ranging from ~4000kb/s to ~1800kb/s and appear to roughly correlate with the sample rate I have them set to (doubled)
[19:22:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, so 9 RTL-SDRs at 250ksps (minimum achieveable sample rate) is not that big a load on USB
[19:23:16] <Zero_Chaos> that's what I *thought* but I'm clearly making it angry :-)
[19:23:52] <Zero_Chaos> my test setup is super non-ideal though, I'm just upset that I can't measure what's wrong
[19:24:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> Is this an X86 system or an ARM system?
[19:24:13] <Zero_Chaos> I know what's wrong, I'm dropping samples, just not sure exactly why aside from things I've ruled out
[19:24:36] <Zero_Chaos> i7-8750H
[19:25:29] <Zero_Chaos> not the newest but the cpu doesn't much care about any of this either in terms of load average or temp.  Its well below when I'm compiling gnuradio for example :-)
[19:25:42] <Zero_Chaos> 6 core with HT and load average is ~3
[19:27:23] <Zero_Chaos> it pretty well has to be usb related.  I'm thinking maybe just the shear number of packets (faster transfers may require larger packets) is causing a througput issue?  That's entirely hypothetical but I am not sure what else to rule out and I don't know how to rule that guess out
[19:27:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> Could be that the buffers on your USB controller aren't adequate.  In gr-osmosdr, there's a "buflen" parameter to tweak USB buffer lengths--I'm not sure where in the stack that's applied, though.
[19:27:44] <Zero_Chaos> I can't measure the percent time busy of the usb controller afaik
[19:28:00] <Zero_Chaos> patchvonbraun[m]: I can set that, I haven't yet
[19:28:52] <Zero_Chaos> any idea for a "stupidly max" value to set for testing?
[19:29:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> 32K?  
[19:30:36] <Zero_Chaos> default is 4096, so 32000 ?
[19:30:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> 32768
[19:32:53] <Zero_Chaos> testing, this may take a few trying to tell the difference
[19:32:55] <Zero_Chaos> thanks
[19:33:17] <Zero_Chaos> Source Device: rtl=8,buflen=32768
[19:33:27] <Zero_Chaos> I added the same to all of them, didn't error
[19:33:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> At 250ksps, that'll create considerable latency, unfortunately.  
[19:34:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> Might not even solve the issue
[19:34:20] <Zero_Chaos> this is a time shifted system as is, that's unconcerning
[19:34:35] <Zero_Chaos> and most of these are a good deal higher than 250ksps
[19:35:18] <tnt> I think it's just a bus issue. You can only fit one 512 byte transfer per microframe and there is only 8 microframe in a frame.
[19:35:20] <Zero_Chaos> it's measured in samples though, so that's still much less than a second
[19:35:33] <tnt> So 9 devices kind of sucks ...
[19:35:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also, you could use "rtl_test" to eliminate any GR scheduling issues while testing.
[19:36:11] <Zero_Chaos> tnt: would it be any difference to split the 9 devices into two hubs on the same controller?  I'm assuming no
[19:37:01] <tnt> Zero_Chaos: I think that's going to be controller dependent.
[19:37:49] <Zero_Chaos> tnt: can confirm that I'm not in love with this usb controller for several pre-existing reasons
[19:37:59] <tnt> is it xhci ?
[19:38:05] <Zero_Chaos> yes
[19:39:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> USB in general sucks.  When you fold-in crappy controllers implementing a crappy protocol...
[19:40:13] <Zero_Chaos> I agree.  Unfortunately with how trunk-recorder works, the performance suffers greatly as the MSPS increases.  So having 8 rtlsdrs works better than having 2 airspys (for example)
[19:40:46] <Zero_Chaos> that's cpu performance
[19:41:19] <Yamakaja[m]> What's "trunk recorder"?
[19:41:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> AirSpy is a special case, since it's doing the real-to-complex transform on your CPU
[19:41:32] <Zero_Chaos> I can monitor all of frs with 4 rtlsdrs (for example) but doing it on two airspys melts my cpu
[19:41:40] <Zero_Chaos> patchvonbraun[m]: did not know that, thanks
[19:42:05] <Zero_Chaos> Yamakaja[m]: it's a gr consumer that monitors conventional and trunked radios https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder
[19:42:22] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh, i see
[19:47:06] <Zero_Chaos> thanks for the help all.  Things are working better since I lowered the rate, and I'll monitor a while to see if this crazy amount of buffer helps smooth things out
[19:54:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> In reality on USB2, you cannot exceed somewhere around 320-380Mbits of delivered data without running into trouble in my experience (that's aggregate across a controller)

[23:48:24] <funkylab[m]> no
[23:48:36] <funkylab[m]> I mean, assuming you already have such a signal
[23:57:50] <wizardyesterday> Has anyone created a software AGC for the case of using narrowband reception? If not, I'll write one once I analyze the receive lineup.
[23:58:04] <wizardyesterday> On the HackRF of course.
[23:58:53] <wizardyesterday> oh wrong channel
[23:58:57] <wizardyesterday> Sorry about that...
