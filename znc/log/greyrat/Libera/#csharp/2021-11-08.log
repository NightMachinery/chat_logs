[00:16:48] <Bilz> Hi. WPF binding question: I've made a user control called SearchParamsControl. In the SearchParamsControl you can modify a SearchParams class. SearchParams has a bunch of properties and in the xaml I bind to the properties. I expose the SearchParams through a dependency property, and so in my ViewModel for my MainWindow I have a SearchParams property, and in my MainWindow.xaml I have a SearchParamsControl that binds to the dependency property SearchParams.
[00:16:48] <Bilz> When I make a changes in my SearchParams controls in my MainWindow, my ViewModel is not being notified. How can I funnel this through i.e. be notified of changes in SearchParams properties in the ViewModel. Hope that makes a bit of sense...

[01:18:04] <Nasp> Mask mandates and corona passports might come back like tomorrow or something :/
[01:27:30] <blez> Nasp where?
[01:27:36] <Nasp> Denmark
[01:27:40] <bomb> upcoming vaccination mandate for small kids annoys me most
[01:27:47] <Nasp> Mandate really?
[01:28:00] <Nasp> I saw some countries made laws where you could fire unvaccinated employees, sounds rather insane to me
[01:28:08] <Nasp> I still don't get why we need the masks or passport again
[01:28:25] <blez> cause it will never end?
[01:28:34] <bomb> it just gets dumber and dumber
[01:28:58] <bomb> I just wish it didn't affect the kids, at least.
[01:29:54] <blez> but it does. A friend of mine has her baby sick from covid
[01:30:36] <blez> that's why there are mask mandates and similar, cause there is no simple way to stop it
[01:32:00] <bomb> does it help, though?
[01:32:16] <N1N> Yes
[01:32:45] <bomb> if you say so

[01:34:03] <bomb> ?
[01:35:01] <N1N> Are you asking if it works because you want to be contradictory or because you geniunly believe it doesn't make a difference?
[01:35:57] <Nasp> Didn't research say masks didn't work?
[01:36:15] <Nasp> Also kids get it in school or daycare, they dont wear masks there
[01:36:37] <blez> no? People in Asia are wearing them 15+ years at least. I don't think they're dumb in any way
[01:37:13] <blez> masks work, I thought everyone got that already
[01:37:48] <bomb> I don't think WHO decided that one yet

[02:34:59] *** Quits: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:35:44] <Nasp> Or LINQ in general does
[02:35:53] <Nasp> That's why many uses predicate builders
[02:36:46] <Nasp> OrWhere just wouldn't work by default
[02:36:58] <Nasp> Too high a chance people will fuck it up
[02:43:59] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: but how do you do "parenthesis" with that
[02:44:22] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, easily?
[02:44:56] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: i mean, if you do .Where().Where().OrWhere, does that only apply to the previous where's, all where's before that, etc.
[02:45:29] <N1N> What's a usecase of OrWhere?
[02:45:32] <DevJohnC> well it's a chained linq expression so it applies to the result of any previous method calls
[02:45:38] <Suchiman> and if you follow that up with another Where, is that and with the OrWhere or what's the scope of that then
[02:46:33] <DevJohnC> I guess the reason it doesn't exist is because it doesn't chain well with other LINQ methods
[02:47:21] <DevJohnC> N1N, if (isFilterActive) query = query.OrWhere(x => x.FilterProp == filterProp);
[02:47:23] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: i'd say it doesn't exist because it doesn't work outside of Queryable
[02:47:29] <DevJohnC> right
[02:47:40] <DevJohnC> still it's something EF does need a solution for imo
[02:47:49] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: LINQ works in stages, so there's no way to undo the filtering the Where had already done after that
[02:47:55] <N1N> Ah. We use a WhereIf extension at work

[12:00:25] <MaNa2k> Nasp, btw, do you know if its possible to somehow offline cache your keyvault so that it wont take ages to load when testing locally ?
[12:00:46] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, i think its coming tomorrow
[12:00:55] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: why do you need a key vault when testing?
[12:01:17] <MaNa2k> because we have all our connection strings, pw, etc there
[12:01:44] <MaNa2k> i could put it in a config, but thats just asking for a mess
[12:02:38] <JakeSays> yeah i wouldn't use a key vault for that. there are a lot of ways of solving those issues
[12:02:57] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, im all ears :P
[12:03:11] <JakeSays> first is not using connection strings, pwd's, etc. of systems that need securing
[12:03:32] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, ah that
[12:03:53] <MaNa2k> we only have this one which we are actually going to change to using AD login
[12:04:28] <MaNa2k> but we have some external apis that has tokensn\ un\pw, lots of random stuff we have in keyvualt
[12:04:50] <MaNa2k> our customers have, we only consume *
[12:05:11] <MaNa2k> they dont support AD login
[12:05:37] <MaNa2k> they have these super long tokens which we only use for auth
[12:07:41] <JakeSays> i wrote a parameterized configuration system once that would do token replacement in a .config file at runtime. the replacement values came from a machine local encrypted file. the replacement value file was deployed once and never changed. production had their values, and each dev would have their own file on their machine. no creds were ever stored in source control, etc. it worked really well.
[12:08:44] <JakeSays> i implemented it to moron proof the system. the devs at the time could NOT manage config files properly. they were always committing production creds
[12:10:49] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  No idea i havent had that problem
[12:11:27] <Nasp> JakeSays:  I've seen so many prod credentials in code or config
[12:11:34] <Nasp> People hate configs file where i work and just hardcode it
[12:11:39] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, sounds like overengineering
[12:11:39] <JakeSays> bah. today will require loads of caffeine
[12:12:30] * biberu sends påtår
[12:12:37] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: overengineering? it solved a serious problem in the most efficient way possible. that's the definition of a good solution, not overengineering.
[12:12:58] <MaNa2k> JakeSays, yes it does, was just kdding. sounds cool though
[12:13:39] <JakeSays> Nasp: i sympathize with them. ms's configuration system has always sucked ass.
[12:13:53] <MaNa2k> well we try not to put any sensitive stuff in the config anymore, so we just dump that shit in keyvault-nonprod, which makes every code that uses it locally slow as hell to load
[12:14:08] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: right.
[12:14:28] <MaNa2k> and we use datafactory to push the keyvault-nonprod keys to keyvault-prod env when we are ready to release
[12:15:14] <MaNa2k> and the same for customer\company structure comfig. we push that stuff with datafactory to prod base
[12:15:19] <JakeSays> i created an extension as an experiment that could pull the replacement values from a central server, which would've been great for production.
[12:18:40] <MaNa2k> feel like i have memory like a gold-fish. when a debugging session takes too long to get to the code line where the problem is, my brain tends to fade away and forget what i was suppose to look for
[12:18:51] <MaNa2k> *when im debugging....
[12:20:10] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: dude that's my life. i can't stand delays because i lose my train of thought super easily.
[12:21:27] <JakeSays> i've been working on a system that takes about 90 seconds to hit a breakpoint in main(). it's been driving me insane.
[12:21:40] <sysRPL> so i want to add a few more demos to my opengl vector graphics library ... and am open for ideas
[12:21:55] <sysRPL> i was thinking about writing a vector version of pacman
[12:22:59] <sysRPL> you know, pacman, but rendered using vector graphics and zooming up close and or around to see the smooth lines / curves of pacman and the ghosts
[12:24:25] <sysRPL> and i had this idea about encoding the maze shape, powerups, tunnel, start position, ghost hideout as ascii art

[22:43:21] <Cecen> It seems like some sort of caching, but I've never been able to find any documentation. The same issue sometimes occurs if you create a new file and immediately check if it exists

[23:08:22] <Cecen> I'm doubtful, since the create + check if exists scenario fails as if the newly created file doesn't exist unless you retry after a couple hundred ms
[23:09:12] <Cecen> I just ran into it on an empty lock file (create -> close -> delete -> delete fails because 'file is still open' -> retry after 200 ms -> success)

[23:31:11] <DevJohnC> .net 6 is out
[23:32:38] <lz__> vs2022 too right? I guess you need it for .net 6 ?
[23:33:10] <DevJohnC> it is out, yes
[23:36:01] <Nasp> Just got done with .NET 5 updates a few months ago
[23:36:06] <Nasp> And still have a big monolith back

[23:38:04] <lz__> any idea for a birthday gift for a 70yo lady

[23:42:07] <ki9a> this isn't even a joke
[23:42:34] <Nasp> We have 50 or so controllers in the root folder of "controllers"
[23:42:46] <Nasp> Would it be a bit to aggresive to just make a folder called "garbage" and dump it in there

[23:51:00] <JakeSays> jonp: yeah. i'm just bugging Suchiman
[23:51:55] <JakeSays> i wonder what the chances are of vs'19 extensions running in vs'22
[23:52:19] <jonp> alas, i don't know. :-(
[23:52:42] <JakeSays> i'm betting not good
[23:52:45] <jonp> i know the team working on the Android & iOS extensions had to do a lot, but i don't know how much was due to VS vs. e.g. JDK changes.
[23:52:56] <jonp> vs. "time for more features & bug fixes!"
[23:53:11] <lz__> I've been thinking about it for weeks and I can't think of anything except flowers and chocolates
[23:53:18] <ki9a> except for regkeys and installation we didn't have to do anything
[23:53:47] <ki9a> oh and the debugger broke because of an 32 bits vs 64 assumption
[23:53:57] <ki9a> (my debugger that is)
[23:54:07] <jonp> ah yes, the migration to a 64-bit app is really fundamental and wide-ranging
[23:54:45] <Nasp> JakeSays:  None
[23:54:55] <Nasp> Not that it can't, but it needs it's manifest to match
[23:55:01] <Nasp> If you have access to the source you can probably update it
[23:55:14] <lz__> or a book but what's the point of giving books ppl don't read
[23:55:32] <ki9a> jonp: it was quite doable; but just a bad assumption
[23:55:45] <ki9a> debugger runs out of process for mismatching platform
[23:56:08] <ki9a> (I know win64 technically supports debugging 32bits from 64bits, but I'm not into that kind of pain)
[23:56:48] <jonp> i'm sure for "normal" "hard" debugging, as with native code, there's minimal added pain, or none.
[23:56:54] <Nasp> VS2022 seems soo much slower than preview
[23:56:56] <JakeSays> ki9a: oh you are, you just won't admit it
[23:57:01] <jonp> but for "soft" debugging, where. you need assistance from the target, as with .NET…
[23:57:12] <jonp> it could complicate things
[23:57:30] <JakeSays> its only good when its soft
[23:57:44] <lz__> I wonder if with vs2022 I'll still have to delete the .vs cache folder every now and then. I'm not expecting miracles
[23:57:50] <ki9a> jonp: for native debugging the exception codes change for the core exceptions
[23:57:59] <ki9a> (think singlestep, av, breakpoint etc)
[23:58:02] <jonp> oof
[23:58:06] <Suchiman> Nasp: you don't need source access, just unzip the vsixpackage, update the manifest xml and rezip it
[23:58:16] <Nasp> Ahh yeah
[23:58:16] <ki9a> it's not worth the trouble really
[23:58:17] <JakeSays> ki9a: well how convenient
[23:58:22] <ki9a> we just run the debugger out of process
[23:58:26] <Nasp> I tried a bit of extension dev and it doesn't seem nice
[23:58:37] <ki9a> that's because there's no error handling or logging
[23:58:43] *** Joins: zaher_ (~zaher@37.48.150.162)
[23:58:51] <ki9a> half the callstacks are still com
[23:59:05] <JakeSays> Nasp: it is nice if you like dealing with IDispatch com
[23:59:15] <ki9a> the docs are of the quality "Visible: True if this object is visible"
[23:59:21] <JakeSays> lol
[23:59:36] <JakeSays> so vs22 isn't de-comified?
[23:59:45] <Nasp> I had some extensions i wanted to update to 2019 back then
[23:59:48] <jonp> why would it be?
[23:59:51] <Nasp> Kinda got it done, but i think the maintainer is gone
[23:59:59] <Nasp> Also the default template is shgit
