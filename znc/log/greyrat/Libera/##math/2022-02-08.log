[00:07:25] <Franciman> is it related to polarisation?
[00:07:28] <Franciman> like A -> B
[00:07:36] <tolarz> I don't think so
[00:07:47] <Franciman> ok ok! Interesting
[00:07:57] <tolarz> It's rather related to monotonicity of logics.
[00:08:25] <tolarz> Suppose you got a formula F with just /\, \/, ∃ as connectives.
[00:08:35] <tolarz> Suppose a model M such that M |= F.
[00:08:50] <tolarz> Then for any supermodels M' ⊇ M we have M' |= F.

[03:21:15] <Galois> how about just start with the basics. P ∩ Z = 3Z
[03:21:24] <Galois> in particular, by basic set theory, 3Z ⊂ P

[03:22:07] <Galois> what's your definition of prime ideal?
[03:22:21] <isekaijin> rex: Consider the function N(a + ib) = a^2 + b^2. Then, for any nonzero x, y \in Z[i], we have N(xy) >= N(x).

A finite integral domain must be a field (there's a theorem for that ...) and in fact a perfectly reasonable way to check for whether a finite commutative ring is an integral domain is to search for an inverse for every nonzero element

[03:47:37] <zacts> elementary number theory context

[03:48:55] <zacts> don't mean to interrupt the current discussion however
[03:48:55] <isekaijin> Since N(3) = 9, a nontrivial factorization xy = 3 implies that N(x) = N(y) = 3.
[03:49:01] <isekaijin> zacts: Wait a little.
[03:49:04] <zacts> sure
[03:49:35] <isekaijin> rex: So this boils down to showing that 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of squares.

[03:57:54] <PlanckWalk> Black_Eagle: The only way to get a high chance of 5 As in the first 12 cards and fewer As in subsequent batches of 12 cards is to cheat by not shuffling the deck.
[03:58:10] <isekaijin> zacts: The slow method of “division by subtraction” is how you tinker with it.
[03:58:13] <isekaijin> At least in small cases.
[03:58:40] <zacts> yeah, I want to start with the simplest examples and cases.
[03:58:56] <zacts> like could you throw an example problem at me?
[03:59:19] <isekaijin> Sure, find q and r such that 123456789 = 975341 * q + r, and <
[03:59:28] <isekaijin> and |r| < 975341
[03:59:33] <Black_Eagle> PlanckWalk, well, no, not really. i was initially thinking about playing around with expected values in scenario 2. that would obviously give me a lower chance to get those 5 of type A. i just don't know if there is a good way to express "a reasonable chance" in terms of probabilities.
[04:00:22] <PlanckWalk> The main question is how screwed are you if it doesn't happen? :-)
[04:01:38] <zacts> so q and r must be unique.
[04:01:41] <zacts> r is < q
[04:01:46] <Black_Eagle> PlanckWalk, not super screwed. what's that in math words? :P but i think the scenario 1 is more important; how do i ask a hypergeometric calculator to give me a workable number?
[04:01:47] <isekaijin> zacts: No, r isn't unique.
[04:01:50] <isekaijin> zacts: r could be negative.
[04:02:12] <isekaijin> zacts: Also, |r| has to be less than d = 975341, not than q.
[04:02:27] <PlanckWalk> Black_Eagle: Given any number of A and B cards, hypergeomtric formula gives you the exact chance of getting 5 As and 4 Bs to begin with
[04:02:35] <PlanckWalk> (Well, using it twice)
[04:02:36] <zacts> well there's a condition that 0 <= r < b in my posts

[04:04:27] <isekaijin> zacts: Suppose you have n things and want to split them into b equally sized groups. You aren't allowed to split individual things into halves or other fractional parts.
[04:04:40] <zacts> ok

[04:09:32] <zacts> are my above variables accurate tho?

[05:35:27] <isekaijin> Really, commutative algebra is so cool.
[05:36:16] <Z-module> a alone, or ib alone, is a Gaussian prime iff |a| or |b| (respectively) is prime in Z and = 3 (mod 4).
[05:36:38] <rex> Z-module: ok so 2 is still not prime
[05:36:57] <rex> isekaijin: yeah Algebra will definitely be my primary field in the masters degree
[05:36:58] <Z-module> right, it = (1 + i)(1 - i)  and both factors there are non-units

[05:46:08] <isekaijin> If I'm given three similar problems, I try to solve them with three different methods, so that students can see the available possibilities. But students would much rather I pick a single method to solve all three. Preferably the one that can be applied the most mechanically.

[10:36:18] <mra90> PlanckWalk, in reverse? In the chain rule you calculate derivative n times

[10:37:03] <PlanckWalk> And where di n come from?
[10:37:05] <PlanckWalk> did*
[10:37:34] <mra90> chain rule in calculating derivatives
[10:37:44] <mra90> n is the length of the chain :)
[10:38:01] <PlanckWalk> Well, in this case there's only one link in the chain
[10:38:19] <PlanckWalk> Though I suppose you could generalize if you really wanted
[10:38:57] <PlanckWalk> The main thing is that the result of differentiating the composition is a product
[10:39:43] <PlanckWalk> In particular (in Leibniz notation)  df/dx = df/dw  dw/dx
[10:39:55] <PlanckWalk> So there's where the dw/dx comes from
[10:40:32] <PlanckWalk> Or if you really wanted,  dw = 2x dx
[10:40:35] <PlanckWalk> (eww)
[10:41:07] <mra90> for composition I agree
[10:41:31] <PlanckWalk> So ... integral 2x(1+x^2)^2 dx = integral (1+x^2)^2 2x dx = integral w^2 dw
[10:42:03] <mra90> Yes but I am still no sure why we had to make this " dw = 2x dx" step
[10:42:11] <PlanckWalk> Because it's in the chain rule
[10:44:35] <PlanckWalk> or another reason: if you didn't, then you would have  integral 2x w^2 dx  which doesn't help you at all.

[10:45:25] <PlanckWalk> Yes, which is why I put it second

[11:22:25] <PlanckWalk> None of this is answering *how you calculated it*
[11:22:34] <Decker> well... avagadro * radius is a line.
[11:22:39] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[11:22:45] <Decker> which I'm restacking in a cube to get a cube root for side length of space ?
[11:22:51] <Decker> .
[11:23:16] <Decker> and then grams -> kg is *10 on the side of the cube so it's *1000 bigger
[11:23:28] <Decker> so there's a +1 sorta bultin to the cuberoot
[11:23:34] <Decker> to get to kg/fm
[11:23:39] <Decker> err fm/kg
[11:23:59] <Decker> and then the sun's Kg is obvious so I get a fm... which I rescale to km
[11:24:09] <PlanckWalk> Aah then yes that's the error
[11:24:17] <Decker> and that km is much bigger than the physicsal km so I suppose it's not proper to say 'a proton is X size'
[11:24:24] <PlanckWalk> You're dividing the Sun into 1 kg lumps and then lining them up.
[11:25:02] <PlanckWalk> So that explains why you got a number that was ridiculously too large, not not as large as lining up individual protons.
[11:25:10] <PlanckWalk> but* not

[11:27:09] <Decker> why isn't a stack of 1kg cubes the same total volume as any other configuration of cubes?
[11:27:12] *** Joins: AimHere (~David@92.238.16.159)
[11:27:49] <PlanckWalk> It does have the same volume, but you're talking about length
[11:28:06] <Decker> the cuberoot length
[11:28:10] <PlanckWalk> Obviously if you line them up the length is longer than putting them in one big block
[11:28:44] <Decker> so I'm assumin to stack them in a cube
[11:28:52] <PlanckWalk> You only took the cube root when you were calculating the size of the block of 1 kg of protons
[11:29:08] <PlanckWalk> Then multiplied by the number of blocks needed
[11:29:24] <PlanckWalk> I.e. calculating the length of putting them in a line.
[11:29:43] <Decker> ok
[11:31:23] <Decker> 2524646.880km is closer
[11:31:40] <Decker> http://mathb.in/70440
[11:31:58] <PlanckWalk> :-(
[11:32:32] <PlanckWalk> What are the units you get when you take the cube root of a length?
[11:32:43] <Decker> km
[11:32:46] <PlanckWalk> No
[11:32:52] <PlanckWalk> It's km^(1/3)
[11:32:54] <Decker> the units change to m too ?
[11:32:57] <PlanckWalk> No
[11:33:03] <PlanckWalk> It's not even a length anymore
[11:33:18] <Decker> it's say 1000km = 10km ^3
[11:33:29] <Decker> it's say 1000km ^1/3= 10km
[11:33:33] <PlanckWalk> Nope
[11:33:35] <PlanckWalk> That's nonsense
[11:33:58] <Decker> it's say 1000km ^1/3= 10m  ? no.
[11:34:05] <PlanckWalk> What you really want to take the cube root of is the number of boxes
[11:34:12] <PlanckWalk> (Which is unitless)
[11:35:13] <PlanckWalk> I think you made the same error earlier, but with less effect since 1 fm is pretty close to the size of proton.
[11:35:26] <Decker> 1kg  of protons = 8.092e−12km  (which was 1kg=fm)
[11:35:37] <Decker> err km=fm
[11:36:06] <PlanckWalk> The way I'd work it out would be  (mass of sun / mass of proton)  to get number of protons

[11:36:34] <PlanckWalk> Then take the cube root of that, then multiply by size of proton.

[16:11:18] <riv> just that object language S does not need sets internally
[16:11:53] <zeroc00l0> Right, I get that.
[16:12:02] <zeroc00l0> But does the metalanguage always need sets?

[16:15:24] <Franciman> i have a question about the ware-amdahl law, is it a question i can ask here?
[16:15:31] <Franciman> or there are better suited channels?
[16:15:41] <Franciman> (ware amdahl law about parallel programs speedup)
[16:15:57] <riv> you can try asking here
[16:16:05] <riv> maybe there is a stackoverflow
[16:16:26] <Franciman> basically the law is: S(p) = 1 / (a + (1 - a)/p)
[16:17:09] <Franciman> where a is the cost of the sequential part of the algorithm (divided by the total cost)
[16:17:18] <Franciman> so 1 - a is the fraction of work done in parallel
[16:17:22] <Franciman> by p processors
[16:17:28] <Franciman> so everything is fine apparently. But
[16:17:42] <Franciman> in some algorithms you don't always use all the p processors for all the computations, because you need less
[16:17:54] <Franciman> but the law keeps dividing by p nevertheless

[16:18:09] <zeroc00l0> riv: But if I want to interpret some axioms in say PA, do I have to include all of the ZFC axioms or is there some smaller set theory I can use since I'm only trying to define the universe of discourse.
[16:18:14] <Franciman> so there is the generalised ware-amdahl law, in which you split between completely parallel and partially parallel costs
[16:18:24] <Franciman> but it appers to me that the results are the same, is this coincidence?
[16:18:35] <Franciman> or is the generalised ware-amdahl law already contained in the standard one?
[16:18:48] <riv> zeroc00l0: I don't know what you mean about 'include all of the zfc axioms"?
[16:19:27] <zeroc00l0> Okay. I need some axioms that well let me specify a set.  But is there a simpler set theory I can use, rather than ZFC?
[16:19:35] <zeroc00l0> s/well/will
[16:20:24] <riv> oh have you looked at Gentzen's consistency proof of PA?
[16:20:38] <zeroc00l0> No. Should I?
[16:20:41] <riv> instead of doing everything with ZFC, it actually uses PRA + epsilon_0
[16:20:52] <riv> this is kind of like what you're asking I think
[16:21:00] <zeroc00l0> I think so yeah.
[16:21:03] <zeroc00l0> Thanks.
[16:21:06] <riv> you can get a really small set theory to do your metatheory work in
[16:21:20] <riv> (plus one big induction axiom if needed)
[16:21:24] <zeroc00l0> Yeah, that's what I'm trying to ask about I think.

[22:28:56] <Z-module> greenbagels: when they talk about how normal subgroups are exactly kernels of homomorphisms, it's not as powerful as it sounds. The homom. they mean there is simply the map  G -> G/N    where N is the normal subgroup in question. You can almost never leverage this to work with an already-given homomorhpism from G to somewhere.

[22:30:34] <Galois> you know, I noticed there is a subtlety if you do it that way
[22:31:51] <Z-module> Oh?
[22:32:03] <Galois> like, how do you prove inverses are unique?
[22:32:16] <Galois> the usual proof is something like e = ee' = e'
[22:32:21] <Galois> (which requires a two-sided inverse)
[22:32:53] <Galois> sorry I meant identity (similar remarks apply to inverses)
[22:33:17] <Galois> so if you only have one-sided inverses, you have to first prove two-sided-ness, then prove uniqueness?
[22:33:33] <Galois> (I couldn't think of any way to prove uniqueness that did not first go through two-sidedness)
[22:34:04] <Galois> the reason this matters is because in formal logic if you're trying to define something on the grounds of a unique existential it's a different procedure from defining something using a non-unique existential
[22:34:30] <Z-module> Hmm, I'll check that. Of course in non-commutative rings we have a crazy situation, where an element can have a left inverse but no right inverse, and this then implies it must have infinitely many left inverses, by a surprisingly easy construction.
[22:35:39] <Galois> basically, using the non-redundant axiom comes at a price if you're using formal logic. Either you need non-unique existential witness extraction, or a more cumbersome definition construction.

[23:30:40] <isekaijin> There are no examples of uncountable discrete spaces appearing “in the wild”, right?
[23:31:03] <Franciman> isekaijin: maybe i got one, but you'll have to help me
[23:31:16] <Franciman> are you familiar with sorgenfrey?
[23:31:23] <isekaijin> Is it discrete?
[23:31:27] <Franciman> no
[23:31:29] <Franciman> wait
[23:31:30] <isekaijin> I'm familiar with the Sergenfrey line, yes.
[23:31:33] <Franciman> let's call it R_f
[23:31:34] <Franciman> yes
[23:31:43] <Franciman> now let's think about the sorgenfrey space R_f x R_f
[23:31:48] <isekaijin> Ok.
[23:32:04] <Franciman> if you take the subspace { (x, x) \in R_f x R_f } it is homeomorphic to the sorgenfrey line
[23:32:05] <Franciman> if you take
[23:32:21] <isekaijin> No idea, but probably not.
[23:32:26] <Franciman> { (-x, x) \in R_f x R_f } i.e. the other bisector
[23:32:29] <Franciman> of the plane
[23:32:31] <Franciman> it's discrete!

[23:32:51] <isekaijin> The Sorgenfrey line itself is a bit artificial.
[23:33:24] <isekaijin> Does anyone actually use it for something?
[23:33:46] <Franciman> it's surely a counterexample
[23:33:58] <Franciman> let me take my book
[23:34:09] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[23:34:22] <dude12312414> it's used for counterexamples mostly i think
[23:34:56] <Franciman> isekaijin: ok it is used for this example i did
[23:35:21] <Franciman> it is a counterexample to the question: is the product of paracompact spaces still paracompact?
[23:35:23] <Franciman> nope it ain't
[23:36:10] <Z-module> I know it's a niche thing, doesn't really connect up with "real and modern math", but I do love weird-ass topology examples. Like Bing's countably infinite hausdorff connected space.
[23:37:07] <Franciman> do you like the example above, Z-module ?
[23:38:30] <mycroftiv> hey Bing topology, i have been trying to understand that stuff, its really neat because in theory you do it by manipulating shapes in your head, but the higher dimensional homotopies are hard

[23:42:14] <isekaijin> No, it isn't.
[23:42:26] <Z-module> Franciman: the Sorgenfrey Line? Yeah.
[23:43:05] <mycroftiv> i need to check my references, because i thought the infinite binary tree cantor set was the prototype of an uncountable discrete space, because its like 'combing' the real line out to infinite discrete branch tips

[23:43:35] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: What's discrete is the space of continuous functions Cantor -> Bool, I think. But the Cantor space itself isn't discrete.
[23:44:07] <Z-module> Cantor is just 2^N where 2 = a two-point discrete space
[23:44:11] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: i need to check references but I thought according to Martin Escardo these are the same thing
[23:44:18] <isekaijin> No.
[23:44:36] <mycroftiv> that functions Nat -> Bool are exactly the cantor space, accroding to Escardo computational topology viewpoint
[23:44:55] <Z-module> yes, "2^N" means that
[23:45:13] <isekaijin> That isn't just “according to Escardó”. That the Cantor space is 2^N is... pretty much the definition in classical mathematics.
[23:45:26] <mycroftiv> i thought you just said it wasnt?
[23:45:50] <isekaijin> I said that the Cantor space isn't discrete.
[23:45:58] <isekaijin> (Because it isn't.)
[23:46:00] <Z-module> well, classically it's a certain thing in terms of ternary reprentations of reals, but it's easily homeomorphic to 2^N
[23:46:21] <[-_-]> Hello
[23:46:42] <[-_-]> is the vector notation common v=<1,2,3> ?
[23:46:47] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: How could it be discrete? An infinite discrete space can't possibly be compact.
[23:47:01] <[-_-]> do you instantly recognize that as vector notation?
[23:47:02] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Because you can just take the open cover by all the singletons. Good luck taking a finite subcover of that.
[23:47:07] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: this is the Escardo 'seemingly impossible' searches
[23:47:28] <mycroftiv> you can write computer code in sufficently expressive and lazy language to do this
[23:47:32] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Escardó shows that Cantor -> Bool is discrete in his setting. And I think his argument also works classically.
[23:47:36] <mycroftiv> its where Brouwerian view and classical view part
[23:47:45] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: But Cantor != (Cantor -> Bool).
[23:47:53] <isekaijin> Anyhow.

[23:48:06] <mycroftiv> it relates to the essential dividing lines between classical and constructive math and markov's principle
[23:48:28] <isekaijin> Really, read Escadó's paper (or, if you have less time, his slides) more carefully.
[23:48:47] <isekaijin> Escardó *
[23:48:54] <mycroftiv> ive read his papers and slides and code multiple times, im sure im screwing up vocabulary here
[23:49:10] <mycroftiv> ive literally spent a lot of the past 2+ years trying to understand those impossible searches
[23:49:29] <mycroftiv> so im sure im not speaking that precisely because i cant talk math right without an agda or something typechecking me, as you are doing
[23:49:32] <isekaijin> Nah, you're just confusing “Nat -> Bool” with “Cantor -> Bool”. The latter is “(Nat -> Bool) -> Bool”.
[23:50:06] <mycroftiv> im not confusing them, they are both in play in what im saying
[23:50:32] <isekaijin> Okay. Then let's just agree to disagree. But, at least classically, the Cantor space sure as hell isn't discrete.
[23:50:34] <mycroftiv> the exact distinction between our computational knowledge of those two function spaces and the classical view is what Escardo (and my own tangled words) are focusing on
[23:51:01] <mycroftiv> uh, isnt the cantor space compact classically?
[23:51:11] <Z-module> It is
[23:51:13] <isekaijin> It is compact. And also infinite.
[23:51:25] <isekaijin> Compact and infinite --> not discrete.
[23:51:33] <Z-module> 2 is compact, so 2^anthing is also
[23:52:23] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: why does wikipedia seem to be telling me that cantor space is discrete topologically?
[23:52:33] <Z-module> It surely does not, mycroftiv
[23:52:42] <isekaijin> ...
[23:53:00] <mycroftiv> This is usually written as 2 N {\displaystyle 2^{\mathbb {N} }} 2^\mathbb{N} or 2\u03c9 (where 2 denotes the 2-element set {0,1} with the discrete topology)
[23:53:14] <mycroftiv> that isnt saying that the cantor space as a whole has the discrete topology?
[23:53:18] <Z-module> But it is totally disconnected
[23:53:50] <Z-module> Which part of which specific WP article?
[23:54:04] <isekaijin> The Cantor space is the product of |N| copies of 2. It has the product topology.
[23:54:44] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: so that sentence i pasted is referring not to the whole space, but rather the subspace 0.1 which is discrete?

[23:55:20] <isekaijin> ?
[23:55:25] <isekaijin> The product topology on \prod_i X_i is generated by the subbasis consisting of the opens U_i x \prod_{j \ne i} X_j, where U_i is an open in X_i.
[23:55:26] <mycroftiv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space is where i was referencing, but im suspeccting now that i am the victim of (my own) vast misreading of what clauses of sentences are referring to what
[23:56:13] <mycroftiv> i read the sentence above LONG ago as telling me that cantor space was itself discrete, and have had that idea completely locked in for years
[23:56:24] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: If there are finitely many factors, say, X_1 through X_n, then U_1 x ... x U_n is an open in X_1 x .... x X_n, where each U_i is an open in the corresponding X_i.
[23:56:34] <isekaijin> But if there are infinitely many factors, then this doesn't work anymore.
[23:57:10] <isekaijin> And, of course, 2^N = 2 x 2 x 2 x ...
[23:58:10] <mycroftiv> yeah. this whole issue of how infinite binary bitstrings are topologized, and why filters/ideals have this unifying power between logic and topology and geometry, is right at the core here
[23:58:20] <Z-module> They could have omitted "Hausdorff" in the sentence "A (non-empty) Hausdorff topological space is compact metrizable if and only if it is a continuous image of a Cantor space."  This result, by the way, isn't all that hard, and to me is the biggest surprise in having never once come up in my quite decent undergrad math-major education.
