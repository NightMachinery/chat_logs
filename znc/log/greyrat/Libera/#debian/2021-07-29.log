[11:35:01] <dob1> it's the default one or am I wrong?
[11:35:15] <Khepra> that very much depends on the application. a signal is just that. an application needs to have a signal handler and then do something when it's called
[11:35:32] *** Joins: segnior (segnior@user/segnior)
[11:36:07] <dob1> Khepra, but when you clock the "x" what happened?  the window decoration are not part of the window manager? it will send a signal to the application or am I simplify too much?
[11:36:08] <Khepra> dob1: I'm not sure if "default" is the right word, but it's definitely a... standard signal in signalling program termination. there's also SIGQUIT, and certain process managers will do a TERM+KILL dance for disobeying programs

[11:37:27] <Khepra> dob1: unix "signal" is a very specific term, covered by signal(2) and signal(7) manpages. GUI operations can be anything from using unix signals, through dbus "signalling" or direct function calls across libraries.
[11:37:48] *** Joins: Midjak (~Midjak@82-65-111-221.subs.proxad.net)
[11:38:12] <dob1> Khepra, ah ok!
[11:38:17] <Khepra> dob1: with that, you should understand that signalling is part of IPC. you don't send a signal normally within the same process. you do so between processes. dbus similarly.
[11:38:34] *** Joins: Quietus (~quietus@larch.ratcliffefamily.uk)
[11:39:08] <Khepra> so I'd assume that reacting to X is part of the program process, or at least the program registers function hooks for the WM to call when certain APIs are to be used
[11:39:16] <dob1> Khepra, unfortunately I wa simplify it too much for my lack of knowledges

[11:45:31] <Khepra> or look into individual frameworks API. for example, gtk: https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkApplication.html . here, it uses the word "signal" but it's not unix signal(2). you register a function for specific "signals" in gtk terminology, and gtk frameworks call those functions when they want to "signal" (not signal(2) :) ) your program.

[15:40:45] <Khepra> punkgeek: you can't. but you can give them passwordless sudo rights
[15:41:21] <Khepra> alternatively, something somethign dbus/polkit based authorization for that one user, since netplan is a service that can be restarted.
[15:41:30] <ansgar> You can, but it requires policykit from experimental.
[15:41:39] <Khepra> that said, this all sounds like a terrible idea and network config should be left for the root only.

[15:42:26] <Khepra> and I'm guessing this is actually about Ubuntu. nobody sane installs netplan on debian. ;)
[15:42:27] <ansgar> that is netplan.io. :)
[15:42:46] <Khepra> ansgar: so what calendar netplan is there to be "restarted without sudo"?
[15:43:11] *** Joins: diogenes_ (~diogenes_@93.116.130.26)
[15:47:39] <punkgeek> Khepra: In the passwordless sudo, still needs to have sudo access? or I can give permission only running one commnad by sudo?
[15:48:21] <ansgar> Khepra: This one: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man8/netplan.8.html  Don't know if it requires a restart after one changed permissions.
[15:48:41] <Khepra> punkgeek: you can give a user privilege to only run one path, with passwordless sudo. in this case, you'd need to write a shim script that calls systemctl controls on the netplan service, and then give the passwordless sudo access to that shim script only
[15:48:52] <Khepra> that way they still can't run passwordless sudo on any systemctl command
[15:49:57] <ansgar> You can also just allow "systemctl restart whatever" in sudoers.
[15:50:10] <ansgar> Then one can just run that command with the given arguments via sudo.
[15:50:32] <Khepra> I prefer shim scripts. vastly more certain about what can or can't b erun.
[15:50:58] <Khepra> punkgeek: meanwhile, are you actually asking about netplan.io the network meta-config manager, or netplan "an  IP server that serves calendar data to plan(1) programs" ?
[15:53:04] <punkgeek> I've use this method but didn't work https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/v87gvgh7SV/
[15:53:15] <punkgeek> the ip manager
[15:53:42] <Khepra> oh lol.
[15:54:10] <Khepra> punkgeek: btw, %account defines a group, not username. is that what you want?
[15:55:05] <Khepra> and also, I'd use the full, explicit definition   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/systemctl restart netplan-ovs-cleanup.service
[15:55:12] <punkgeek> So I should create group at first, then add the group of users that can have access to restart the netplan ?
[15:55:24] <Khepra> if you want an entire group to access, rather than just individual users, yes

[16:08:32] <pflanze> Hmm, I want to use host debian, thus network access is the only change; also I need "me" to always reach "me", which means, I'd have to set up the namespace right upon login so that the whole desktop runs as that. And then when I "su" to another user it will have to use another namespace.
[16:08:48] <pflanze> I don't know if that's easily doable. But in any case, iptables *should* just work, no?

[16:09:52] <pflanze> Now I've got no idea what that does... guess I'll have to study the docs.
[16:09:59] <pflanze> Hmm.
[16:10:16] <pflanze> Aren't ACKs part of "-p tcp"??
[16:10:50] *** Joins: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd)
[16:10:54] <Khepra> pflanze: yes but you have one direction with -A INPUT|OUTPUT. ACKs need both, so the ESTABLISHED,RELATED just marks the entire flow, post 3-way synack dance, as permitted.
[16:11:01] *** Joins: digilink (~digilink@user/digilink)
[16:11:20] <Khepra> basically when you permit access you permit only the initial SYN. thje first, ESTABLISHED,RELATED rule then permits all such established flows properly
[16:12:33] <Khepra> that was, btw, the part I wasn't 100% if all that traffic originating internally on the lo iface, behaves differently from when packets actually leave the interface. 
[16:13:14] <pflanze> I really wish there were a packet and rule processing visualizer.

If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[19:35:12] <randall> de-facto: I'd backport it myself. ^^^
[19:37:08] <de-facto> randall, yeah go ahead, it needs quite a lot of go libs to compile
[19:37:29] <randall> ,checkbackport acmetool
[19:37:33] <de-facto> btw only the 0.2.X versions are useable with lets encrypt
[19:37:40] <judd> Backporting package acmetool in sid‚Üíbuster/amd64: unsatisfiable build dependencies: Build-Depends: debhelper-compat (= 13).
[19:37:44] <Khepra> I prefer dehydrated. single shell script :)
[19:38:52] <de-facto> but i did not realize the binary does depend only on very few libs, so it runs just fine also with older versions of debian
[19:40:26] <de-facto> only linux-vdso.so.1 libcap.so.2 libpthread.so.0 libc.so.6 lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

[22:24:58] <tharkun> jhutchins: I know, an off line source system would be perfect, but the isue it is a production server and stopping it would cost me my job. So a I must make a different aproach. This imaging and localy upgrading is for my peace of mind. I might as well clone what dpkg has installed and build a different vm on an image. Chances of having a different behaviour I believe are slim.

[22:26:14] <Khepra> considering what the test is really about, I'm sure you can rsync it, and the possible half-states of some files that were written in the middle of rsync, wont' affect the test
[22:26:52] <Khepra> if I understood your original question correctly, you want/need to test upgradeability of the system, so the most important things won't be changed mid-rsync: the actual binaries to be upgraded, pacakge metadata, configs.
[22:27:29] <jhutchins> tharkun: What's your hypervisor?
[22:27:40] <Khepra> production data (databases, email, logs, ...) probably are not relevant for an upgrade test. but you're the best judge of that.
[22:27:48] <tharkun> jhutchins: kvm IIRC
[22:28:14] <tharkun> Khepra: You have a valid point there.
[22:28:16] <jhutchins> I know VMWare has the ability to clone a live system, I don't know about KVM.
[22:28:50] <jhutchins> tharkun: Otherewise you're just going to have to make them see reason and schedule downtime.  You can't NOT have downtime and keep a system up-to-date/secure.

[22:32:43] <tharkun> Ok, I will have to ponder the degree of replication. The data on the server is properly backed up locally just the running "shell" of the vps is the one missing. As for kernel security patches the downtime is minimal under 5 minutes and it is usually carefully schedule so the majority of traffic is attended by other machines.
[22:32:52] <jhutchins> tharkun: The problem is with locked, open files, and files that are being written to.
