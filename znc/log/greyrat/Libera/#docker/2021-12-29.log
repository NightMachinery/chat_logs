[00:21:12] <molt> Hey all! I've been messing around with Docker on my Synology NAS & have a Question: I have a wildcard cert for my homelab and was wondering how I could give my Docker containers FQDNs with SSL. I tried setting things up a Reverse Proxy in my Synology but it didn't work.
[00:21:39] *** Joins: Enitin (~Enitin@82.102.22.84)

[00:38:29] <Tach> tabakhase do you use the go client to check docker messages?
[00:39:50] <tabakhase> Tach hm noe? what go client do you even mean? (docker logs?) -- then na, the ones that are worthy go into ELK
[00:40:18] <Tach> tabakhase no to take actions on things like when a  container gets created
[00:40:29] <tabakhase> (or rather mostly graylog these days via gelf)
[00:42:26] <Tach> tabakhase yeah but that's something completely different
[00:44:57] <tabakhase> then ya gotta be more precise on "what go client do you even mean?" -- like "take actions when" isnt even logs, that has its very own "docker events" system 
[00:45:43] <molt> Basically, when I put the URL I created in the reverse proxy for= the docker container I created it doesn't load.
[00:46:17] <molt> (tabakhase)
[00:46:18] <tabakhase> molt "the URL" as in...?
[00:46:54] <molt> the FQDN. for example "portainer.myhomelab.com"
[00:47:13] <tabakhase> and you put that where exactly?
[00:47:39] <Tach> tabakhase go packages
[00:47:59] <molt> in the reverse proxy settings for my Synology. I didn't want to bother with those details here because this is a docker IRC channel, not Synology
[00:48:27] <molt> I tried setting things up in "Control Panel" --> "Login Portal" -->'Advanced' --> "Reverse Proxy"
[00:49:03] <tabakhase> molt point kinda is, few different cogs at play here (from the client (your notebook), to the reverse-proxy, further to docker and into the right container) 
[00:49:13] <molt> I also set up a reverse proxy there so I could access my NAS without havign to enter the non-standard HTTPS port (5001). That worked just fine.
[00:49:46] <molt> tabakhase. Yeah, I know. The plight of the modern era.
[00:50:01] <molt> Too many moving parts
[00:50:29] <tabakhase> molt the reverse may need to know the "hostname" to make its routing-decision, but WHERE it shall route to has nothing todo with these hostnames anymore, if you want to hit some docker container thats run with "-p 127.0.0.1:8014:80" the target for the proxy running on the host is 127.0.0.1:8014
[00:50:56] <ikke> traefik can take care of that for you
[00:51:40] <tabakhase> if you run the whole proxy in docker - you can "skip the -p" step and use named-networks (and with that "container names can be resolved") - but for publishing just that one or these 3 contianers real quick, using the proxy on the host is just fine too
[00:52:14] <molt> Righto - that is how I set things up. And it worked with my NAS being accessible from "nas.myhomelab.com" rather than "nas.myhomelab.com:5001"
[00:52:26] <molt> But not with any of my Docker containers
[00:52:33] <molt> I'll try traefik
[00:52:49] <tabakhase> and you can obvs even combine that - have the hosts haproxy (thats what syn uses i think) hand over to one trafik container with a published port, and then let that use docker-networking to fan out to the rest or so, sky is the limit ;-)
[00:52:53] <ikke> Your reverse proxy listens on 80/443, and then proxies to the port the application is running on

[18:17:33] <tabakhase> bdax where you mean?
[18:18:24] <tabakhase> $$ escapes, usually used when you want something like `command: "something -pass $$PASS"`
[18:19:07] <tabakhase> and env_file isnt rly the same as "just .env" - env_file ships all vars in this file to the container, but compose doesnt have access to them itself -- while the ".env" one is actually read by compose
[18:19:57] <tabakhase> so youd either a) remove  the environment: section (what breaks labels: yes) - or b) kick out env_file: and rename settings.env to .env 
[18:20:33] <bdax> ah right, so .env is a automatically recognised file then? and then I'd use a single $?
[18:21:11] *** Joins: havv (~havvi@46-117-255-33.bb.netvision.net.il)
[18:21:22] <tabakhase> bdax lastly, "if labels is more  local-you config" - you could create another compsoe file (docker-compose.override.yml) wich can be gitignored/uncommited, then you can put the hardcoded mail in there and compose will "merge the files"

[18:22:19] <tabakhase> (so that override-file will ONLY contain "something: labels: ...")

[18:23:32] *** Joins: ueberall (ueberall_l@user/ueberall)
[18:24:54] <tabakhase> can build very fancy things with that :P - override is just the default, but you can create a number of those, call compose with "-f 1.yml -f 2.yml" or set the COMPOSE_FILE env-var (wich then can also be stored in the .env file again) -- that way you can "pick and choose" might be the plain compose-file in prod, but on test you add "docker-compose.db.yml" to it for a local sql --- while on 
[18:24:54] <tabakhase> dev you use db.yml and also bind.yml that adds a bindmount to hotreload the code or such - all while still beeing "100% compose"
[18:25:39] <tabakhase> override is very nice to "quickly squat your needed traefik labels into whatever project" =)

[20:42:58] <deuxexmachina> programmerq: Just realized the setup we talked about the other day using aliases: in the docker/traefik config so the containers can talk to each other works fine, but to access the system with a browser I need those FQDNs in /etc/hosts (as the loopback addr). Not a big deal, but any idea how it can work without the /etc/hosts records?
[20:44:19] <fly> what should I look at if a container fails to resolve dns?
[20:44:42] <fly> wish I could just switch it to use IPs, but then it complains about certificates :-/
[20:46:44] <fly> and apparently using /etc/hosts or /etc/resolv.conf doesn't work
[20:46:48] <fly> I don't get how anything works
[20:47:03] <tabakhase> deuxexmachina no, straight up impossible / "docker elected not to take care of this"
[20:47:31] <deuxexmachina> tabakhase: is that a quote from a docker dev or something?
[20:47:53] <fly> (I've found that running the container privileged works, but it's really hard to convince docker build to run privileged)
[20:48:38] <deuxexmachina> it seems the docker containers need to be started *before* the /etc/hosts entrees, or else the browser cannot access them... So if I add the /etc/hosts records after the containers are up, it seems to make no different. Any idea why?
[20:48:47] <deuxexmachina> tabakhase: ^
[20:48:54] <tabakhase> that said, some dude was like "no...?" and wrote a proxy to hook your host into the dockerdns again (what goes kinda hammy as at the same time docker uses your host for dns, so its a crclejerk ;D) https://github.com/mageddo/dns-proxy-server --- but rly rly rly the better fix is a simple "yea, thats on you" - as a echo >> /etc/hosts isnt "that hard anyhow" ;-)
[20:49:49] <deuxexmachina> yes, not hard... but i dont quite understand the 'why'
[20:50:02] <deuxexmachina> specifically my last question about when the records are available
[20:50:07] <deuxexmachina> having to be before docker-compose puts the containers up
[20:50:48] <tabakhase> deuxexmachina and no clue what you try to say on the "it seems..." message - sounds more like you got some cache that intercepted whatever you attempted...
[20:51:46] <deuxexmachina> no caching on my distro afaik

[22:58:19] <deuxexmachina> tabakhase: ya just trying to keep it local... dev environment with no domains. I assume "real DNS record" means a domain registered with ICANN. Just want to simulate within dev environments for now. Didn't realize /etc/hosts would need to be involved to get the browser accessing traefik's docker environment. I figured traefik might have a way to do without changing /etc/hosts. Within the dockerized
[22:58:21] <deuxexmachina> environment all domains are simulated correctly now, but the browser just can't talk to it without /etc/hosts.

[23:00:50] <tabakhase> deuxexmachina as said, traefik doesnt give a poop - it just reads whatever your browser wrote into the http-header "host:" -- simple to demo if you use curl from your host with the correct ip (your forwarded port) and a manual host-header with the domain
[23:01:47] <tabakhase> and obvs traefik could make such a decision on the "path" just as well, domain is just common cause lotta things arent build to run in random subdirs ;D
[23:01:52] *** Joins: ueberall (ueberall_l@user/ueberall)
[23:01:54] <deuxexmachina> traefik is able to redirect the containers FQDNs to each other using aliases: though
[23:02:11] <deuxexmachina> so it can change FQDNs into local IPs 
[23:02:35] <deuxexmachina> I guess just not for requests from outside the dockerized environment (like coming from the browser on the same system)
[23:03:15] <tabakhase> one fancy trick if you "dont need an actual domain" - BUT must use default ports (80/443) is that you can not only use -p 127.0.0.1:80:80 - but also  -p 127.255.255.254:80:80 (and every single ip inbetween)
[23:04:03] <tabakhase> nice when you have "different stacks that you dont want to mix" inside a traefik instance or so :P
[23:06:48] <tabakhase> and "traefik->target container" shouldnt need to use aliases/fulldomains - that uses servicenames directly as it discovers when using labels or such -- answer here may diff. if you use staticCfg or so
