[02:03:43] <DrZak> well, the heat needs to escape somewhere to move the turbines

[02:06:13] <CptLuxx> sure you can convert heat to energy but you need a cold side :P
[02:06:27] <DrZak> there isnt a way to directly switch heat into power
[02:06:47] <CptLuxx> there is thats how rtgs work
[02:07:06] <sd> 07<Sâ€‹trongBad> Stirling engine?
[02:07:16] <CptLuxx> A thermocouple is a thermoelectric device that can convert thermal energy directly into electrical energy using the Seebeck effect. It is made of two kinds of metal (or semiconductors) that can both conduct electricity. If they are connected to each other in a closed loop and the two junctions are at different temperatures, an electric current will flow in the loop. Typically a large number of thermocouples are connected in series to
[02:07:16] <CptLuxx>  generate a higher voltage.
[02:07:16] <DrZak> yea but thats not usable in normal situation
[02:07:35] <CptLuxx> not effective but it works

[02:08:06] <sd> 07<Sâ€‹trongBad> So the 60% lost in burning natural gas is mostly heat going into the atmosphere and mechanical losses?
[02:08:13] <CptLuxx> yes
[02:08:38] <sd> 07<Sâ€‹trongBad> And it's probably too expensive to try to harvest the heat
[02:09:20] <CptLuxx> what you wanna do with the heat?
[02:09:24] <DrZak> something hot needs to cool down in order to move
[02:09:29] <CptLuxx> how you wanna harvest it?
[02:09:37] <CptLuxx> heat pumps? they need electricity...
[02:09:48] <CptLuxx> sure you can use the waste heat to heat houses and stuff
[02:09:57] <CptLuxx> most europen countrys do that with waste heat.. 
[02:10:10] <DrZak> yea, but there's still a lot of it left

[02:11:03] <sd> 07<Sâ€‹trongBad> Because heat pumps are really efficient it can be better to use the heat pump

[18:17:26] <Hunterkll> then pooled together

[18:23:51] <monr0e> Sure, for flash storage and the consumer market. But for a DC environment? Everything else has rack standards. Strikes me as odd we don't see drives with space for vapour cooling systems or something of the like

[18:26:09] <monr0e> Well, to a degree. But picture this: A drive of twice the height, but with a lower data density to match the current 20tb offering. A small cooling chamber to manage the internal atmosphere, and you might actually bring the dwpd figure up. Longer expected lifetimes would be wicked
[18:26:12] <CptLuxx> your mom forgot you
[18:26:13] <Hunterkll> they're rated in terms of power-off lifespan for data retention

[18:51:16] <monr0e> knowing how long it lasts for
[18:51:36] <DrZak> wat?
[18:51:48] <DrZak> tape storage is the best for long term storage
[18:52:10] <DrZak> if you need to have stuff 10-15 years somewhere, you just do the backup and have a company take it to a bunker

[18:53:41] <Hunterkll> LTO-5 is decent, LTO-4 is dumb cheap 
[18:53:44] <Hunterkll> price wise on the used market
[18:53:50] <Hunterkll> i've got an LTO-5 in my desktop
[18:55:19] <monr0e> In theory tape can last for 50 years. With that said, its incredibly vulnerable to all sorts of environmental issues - not to mention, if something goes awry with the reader, tape is kinda fragile. Sure, it works as a cheap(ish) option per GB, but if there's a flooding incident you're quite possibly fucked. Optical media doesn't have that environmental vulnerability, at least not to the same extent
[18:55:38] <monr0e> although strictly speaking, who needs backups for more than 50 years anyway
[18:55:56] <Hunterkll> I've had to pull ~25 year old backups for projects before
[18:56:09] <mistiry> an average business might not, but plenty of use-cases for long term backup storage
[18:56:12] <Hunterkll> and I know we've had to pull a ~40 year old source code dump out of archive before 
[18:56:13] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> old employer had a 40yr retention period
[18:56:25] <mistiry> theres a reason M-DISC's are a thing
[18:56:27] <Hunterkll> but also, nominally, you'd be transiting it to new media every 5-10 years 
[18:56:45] <Hunterkll> M-DISC also is no more reliable than high quality regular media, according to a variety of testing, including the navy 
[18:56:45] <monr0e> hm. ok then, I stand corrected. And now that I think about it, it is highly likely that this acerage time would increase exponentially
[18:57:02] <Hunterkll> but that's if you're super selective about media
[18:57:10] <Hunterkll> M-DISC is just an easy "this is top tier media" label
[18:57:19] <Hunterkll> like buying T-Y CD-Rs back 20 years ago
[18:57:22] <mistiry> right. and marketed toward.... long term backup storage.
[18:57:29] <mistiry> which was the only point i was making
[18:57:35] <Hunterkll> but i'd rather tape
[18:57:58] <Hunterkll> monr0e: also, you mention flooding, environment, etc - optical disc is just as susceptible to environmental damage, and otherwise, you're using heavy duty storage safes 
[18:58:01] <DrZak> aaah, love jokes
[18:58:03] <DrZak> There's a nervous man on a bridge, a rope around his neck tied around big rock in his hands. A woman noticed, she ran to him screaming "Stop, dont jump".

[19:00:21] <monr0e> Hunterkll: I wouldn't say *just* as susceptible. Assuming your optical media is kept out of sunlight and above freezing, it's pretty much fine unless you have a fire or you scratch it up. But chances are, your backup media is either automated, or kept reasonably stationary for the majority of its lifetime

[19:01:47] <nullrend> aaah gdi, my DL580 is too damn expensive to run at home
[19:01:49] <nullrend> oh well
[19:02:54] <nullrend> between a Dell R610 or an HP DL380 G8, what's the best bet?
[19:03:08] <Hunterkll> erm
[19:03:30] <Hunterkll> nullrend: any spec differences?
[19:03:41] <Hunterkll> okay yes
[19:03:47] <Hunterkll> nullrend: on purely CPU basis, the DL380 G8 
[19:03:52] <Hunterkll> you're looking at E5-v2 xeons
[19:04:08] <Hunterkll> Dell Rx10 generation were like, X56xx's iirc 
[19:04:09] <nullrend> bit of difference on the CPU, same amount of RAM, all have spinning disks
[19:04:20] <Hunterkll> yea
[19:04:24] <Hunterkll> you're two generations newer on the DL380
[19:04:44] <nullrend> that's what I was thinking. I'm willing to put up with a bit higher power usage but it's worth it, I think
[19:05:43] <Hunterkll> I had dual X5650's, went to E5-2697v2's (generation the G8 would be), then went to my R730 which is v4's 
[19:05:58] <nullrend> it's going to be for my homelab, so I can put in a bunch of VMs instead of the mishmash of laptops I have right now
[19:06:35] <nullrend> We have some R730s but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't sell one to me :p the G8 is in the recycle pile although I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be
[19:06:47] <Hunterkll> only reason i'm hesitant is the firmware availability
[19:07:08] <Hunterkll> an R710 era machine will run 2019/2022 hyper-v which means it has EPT/SLAT so you're good there for modern hypervisor features
[19:07:13] <nullrend> if it's there it's likely because someone scavenged the RAM, but I have a few 16G sticks that are compatible according to the documentation
[19:07:39] <Hunterkll> yea that's still DDR3 ECC
[19:07:41] <Hunterkll> that generation
[19:07:44] <nullrend> There's one R720xd
[19:08:13] <Hunterkll> that's also V2 xeons 
[19:08:16] <Hunterkll> i'd go for that
[19:08:26] <Hunterkll> same ram, same CPUs 
[19:08:47] <Hunterkll> but not support contract locked firmware
[19:08:52] <nullrend> it'd also give me a chance to merge my storage server and the VM server, reduce my total power footprint
[19:09:46] <Hunterkll> xd models are 2.5" bay tho
[19:10:18] <Hunterkll> just keep that in mind
[19:10:19] <nullrend> storage is an old supermicro x9scm-f, the drives on it **are** 2.5"
[19:10:37] <Hunterkll> nullrend: just do what i did and get some disk shelves
[19:10:38] <Hunterkll> :D
[19:10:39] <nullrend> HBA running in plain JBOD mode so it's all on ZFS
[19:11:59] <Hunterkll> I actually have just two drives in my 730 in raid-1 hardware mode 
[19:11:59] <nullrend> mostly I'm trying to virtualize as much as I can. Reduce my total power footprint, reduce the amount of Stuffâ„¢ I own cos moving a bunch of servers from one apartment to another is heavy work
[19:12:12] <Hunterkll> rest is on the two 24 bay shelves
[19:13:10] <nullrend> eh, the supermicro is good for it. The case does have 24 drive bays
[19:13:20] <nullrend> got it for free at work, they were going to toss it
[19:13:58] <Hunterkll> hm
[19:14:02] <Hunterkll> SAS backplane with cabling?
[19:14:15] <Hunterkll> you could just snake SAS cables out of it and use it as a DAS with an HBA in the new server
[19:14:15] <Hunterkll> :D
[19:14:30] <nullrend> hmmmmmmm that's worth a shot
[19:14:41] <nullrend> still got SAS ports available too
[19:14:59] <nullrend> simplify storage and backup, too
[19:15:21] <nullrend> even if the wiring in-rack is a bit more complex
[19:15:29] <Hunterkll> with an x10 series dell, you wouldn't have much options, if it were a 20 or 30 however, you could get the GPU power cable
[19:15:33] <Hunterkll> to run molex power cabling out
[19:15:59] <Hunterkll> https://www.ebay.com/itm/143011629605
[19:16:00] <nullrend> I'll see if they're willing to part with the R720xd. Definitely sounds like the best option
[19:16:09] <Hunterkll> so you won't have to use the PSU in the supermicro case either
[19:16:15] <Hunterkll> obviously, cabling's up to you
[19:16:40] <nullrend> I didn't check the specs on it, or the RAM, but we have a whole bunch of 16G sticks laying around that I'm sure they'd be willing to part with for cheap
[19:16:50] <nullrend> I was paying more attention to the DL380
[19:16:54] <Hunterkll> it's still DDR3 ECC
[19:17:14] <Hunterkll> i'd call the DL380 G8 and R720xd equal platforms, R720 obviously better firmware and parts availability on ebay
[19:17:22] <Hunterkll> but
[19:17:23] <nullrend> for sure
[19:17:28] <Hunterkll> nullrend: check their iLO/DRAC licensing
[19:17:41] <nullrend> iLO has an advance license on it already
[19:17:45] <Hunterkll> at the point of equal specs (i'm sure you can quick swap some CPUs around :P) 
[19:17:53] <Hunterkll> that'd be something that'd be a differentiater to me
[19:18:29] <Hunterkll> nullrend: if it has the enterprise license for DRAC (or the installed module that grants the license, don't know if they did that after the x10 series) 
[19:18:35] <Hunterkll> then the dell 100% 
[19:18:45] <nullrend> it won't matter that much to me cos it'll be at home but yeah, it sure is nice to have
[19:19:23] <nullrend> En't that good with networking so I do try to make sure the management interface is always available x)
[19:19:26] <Hunterkll> not sure about HP, but at least the dell drac will let you install an OS and shit off the bat 
[19:19:45] <nullrend> iLO Advanced does too
[19:19:56] <nullrend> slow AF over a wireguard tunnel, but it works
[19:20:36] <Hunterkll> oh i mean
[19:20:40] <Hunterkll> without the advanced/enterprise license
[19:21:54] <nullrend> the basic iLO license won't
[19:22:06] <Hunterkll> huh well check the dell
[19:22:11] <Hunterkll> worst case you uh
[19:22:12] <Hunterkll> well
[19:22:14] <nullrend> I think we also have a few licenses left over from when we had HP hardware
[19:22:27] <Hunterkll> something involving an existing licenses and changing the serial number or something

[19:23:01] <nullrend> nothing a bit of looking in dusty corners can't fix
[19:23:05] <Hunterkll> mine came with a legit license, so that factored into my decision to blow $1k

[19:41:03] <nullrend> exactly the kind of thing that would break on my next move
[19:41:12] <Hunterkll> heh
[19:41:30] <Hunterkll> if i had the room, i'd be able to set up all my gear and have the equiv of a full electronics analysis/testing/repair lab
[19:41:37] <Hunterkll> as it is, a lot of stuff is boxed up in kits and whatnot
[19:41:52] <nullrend> and for right nowâ€¦ I need to get to bed cos I'm supposed to be up in four hours to go say goodbye to an employee at my bartender jerb, and THEN go work at my sysadmin jerb
[19:41:53] <Hunterkll> i just have the freq counter and scope out since i'm using them currently
[19:42:02] <Hunterkll> @_@

[19:45:13] <nullrend> This employee has been there for five years so they'll be missed
[19:45:38] <Hunterkll> ah yea that happens
[19:45:54] <nullrend> I am to take over her position, too, to ensure full-time hours year-round instead of just during the summer. But she's cool AF and I'm glad I had a boss like her.
[19:47:46] <Hunterkll> livin the american dream
[19:47:48] <Hunterkll> workin 3 jobs
[19:48:36] <nullrend> can't help it, I'm addicted to service industry
[19:48:46] <nullrend> we all have our vices
[19:48:50] <Hunterkll> as much as i hate to say it i kinda know that feeling
[19:48:59] <Hunterkll> i've wanted to get a weekend job at mcdonalds just to do it again 
[19:49:35] <Hunterkll> .... that and get to yell at a bunch of idiots again without having to worry about HR 
[19:49:38] <nullrend> find a barback job. You still get to see all the stupid stuff people do, but you get to not talk to them unless you want to
[19:49:49] <Hunterkll> oh nah i wouldn't go back non-management
[19:49:58] <Hunterkll> i have too many internal McD's certs and qualifications to do so 
[19:50:18] <Hunterkll> i'm a mid-tier OTP, regionally and nationally certified management courses, etc
[19:50:37] <Hunterkll> honestly if i wanted to i could go back to my old office in the region instead of working in a store
[19:50:40] <nullrend> Myself right now I'm working as a barback/bartende/server/handyman/techsupport/socialmedia at a distillery, bartender at a brewery, and the sysadmin job
[19:50:42] <Hunterkll> but the benefits aren't good enough 
[19:51:05] <nullrend> oh, mcdonald's would never touch me
[19:51:25] <nullrend> I'm too expensive as a cook as it is
[19:51:42] <Hunterkll> 5 years as a store manager: company paid car with gas insurance and maint, you buy it from the company (and get a replacement) after a year at 40% of the value 
[19:51:49] <Hunterkll> or just take the replacement
[19:51:58] <Hunterkll> 10 years as a store manager: 3 months paid vacation
[19:52:04] <Hunterkll> and the benefits package is absolutely amazing
[19:52:09] <nullrend> hell~~~~~ naaaaawwwwwww
[19:52:11] <Hunterkll> but i'd be corporate, not operations directly so 
[19:52:25] <Hunterkll> nullrend: 6-fig easy for an AS 
[19:52:33] <Hunterkll> like, that's starting for a fresh out of the grinder AS 
[19:52:33] <nullrend> HELLLL~~~~~~ NAAAAAWWWWWW
[19:52:44] <Hunterkll> area supervisor
[19:52:49] <Hunterkll> and you're only responsible for 4-5 stores
[19:53:08] <Hunterkll> become an FO and the world is your oyster
[19:53:12] <nullrend> aaaah no wonder they won't raise the minimum wage for us line grunts
[19:53:16] <Hunterkll> want to run a tour managing stores in japan? they'll send you 
[19:53:39] <Hunterkll> nullrend: between running in store shifts, my work down in the regional HQ, and training, i was working 70+hrs a week at times
[19:53:52] <Hunterkll> i'd go back as a floor manager just to run lunch rush
[19:54:00] <Hunterkll> I was king in regional kitchen speed competitions
[19:54:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:54:30] <nullrend> aaah, lunch rushâ€¦
[19:54:48] <nullrend> I used to expo at an 500 seat Irish pub. Fun times.
[19:54:54] <Hunterkll> i've walked into stores and seen uniform violations, sent the person home, and took over kitchen duties 
[19:54:57] <Hunterkll> in a damn suit
[19:55:06] <Hunterkll> i'd throw my motorcycle helmet in the office and just jump in 
[19:55:15] <Hunterkll> like no, fuck you, i've written you up 3 times already for this, fuck off and go home
[19:55:37] <Hunterkll> floor manager at the time: "But what about - i need him!" 
[19:55:41] <Hunterkll> no hun, you got me
[19:56:01] <nullrend> Nothing worse than having one of the suits smack you and then do better at doing your job
[19:56:17] <Hunterkll> throw everyone on table, i'll run both grills & fryers myself
[19:56:47] <Hunterkll> KVS times went down by liek 15 seconds average for that hour lol
[19:57:24] <nullrend> hardcore
[19:57:25] <Hunterkll> customers got a kick out of seeing someone in a suit and tie ensamble running around doing everything hah
[19:57:32] <Hunterkll> i honestly miss that shit
[19:57:51] <Hunterkll> i don't miss running night shift, then running till 3AM, then closing the store due to lack of staff, then coming back at 6AM tho
[19:57:58] <Hunterkll> i'd totally go in as a mid-shift saturday manager tho
[19:58:08] <nullrend> the stress is addicting cos it comes and goes
[19:58:16] <nullrend> then you're high off it for a few hours
[19:58:30] <Hunterkll> I *ALWAYS* worked black friday/thanksgiving overnight
[19:58:45] <Hunterkll> i'd schedule like 15 people and the region's always like "wtf"
[19:58:52] <Hunterkll> then i have the lowest labor % of the region 
[19:59:09] <Hunterkll> no shit i can churn through more customers than you can imagine with you staffing stores near malls with 5 people overnight 
[19:59:23] <Hunterkll> people were coming from *other* stores to ours
[19:59:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:59:26] *** Joins: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat)
[19:59:36] <nullrend> staffing properly is a **thing**
[19:59:56] <Hunterkll> best part? some of those staff? were borrowed from the other slammed stores
[19:59:59] <Hunterkll> idiot store managers agreed
[20:00:03] <Hunterkll> labor was transferred
[20:00:07] <Hunterkll> their problem, not mine
[20:00:07] <nullrend> I keep telling my manager at my serving job they can't keep scheduling four three bartenders plus a manager and only me as server
[20:00:41] <Hunterkll> and you all are working that shitty $2/hr or whatever it is + tips 
[20:00:45] <nullrend> I'm good but I can't be at three places at once
[20:00:49] <Hunterkll> our labor was all fixed 
[20:01:03] <nullrend> I don't think my manager even knows labor cost is a thing
[20:01:20] <Hunterkll> christ
[20:01:25] <Hunterkll> you should see what our DARs look like
[20:01:30] <Hunterkll> mcdonalds has so many fucking metrics
[20:01:37] <Hunterkll> and i fucking spanked them all
[20:01:44] <Hunterkll> i had no qualms about sending people home if it was slow
[20:01:54] <Hunterkll> and no qualms about the fact that i legally have to pay them 3 hours if i call them back in 
[20:02:13] <nullrend> yeah, at server job I see the numbers cos no one, not even the owners, know how to setup the POS properly
[20:02:51] <nullrend> the written documentation sucks but they do have a bunch of videos. They're boring but still watchable at 1.8x
[20:02:55] <Hunterkll> i revolutionalized my distric back in the day
[20:02:58] <Hunterkll> when iw as doing truck checklists
[20:03:04] <Hunterkll> i'd fax myself the truck invoice
[20:03:11] <Hunterkll> and use my convertable fujitsu tablet to check shit off
[20:03:20] <Hunterkll> the whole region was like WTF THIS SI AMAZING 
[20:03:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:03:39] <Hunterkll> i'd just fax the checked and signed invoice back to the store and hand it to the truck drdiver
[20:03:42] <nullrend> "you're doing what with a fax now?"
[20:03:54] <Hunterkll> this was like 2008/2009 tho 
[20:03:55] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:04:01] <Hunterkll> and i was using an eFax service myself
[20:04:40] <Hunterkll> of course, there's things i never reported or snitched on 
[20:04:47] <nullrend> it's always fun when you introduce someone to paperless faxing
[20:04:50] <Hunterkll> like empty cans of modello in the walk in freezer 
[20:04:55] <Hunterkll> or this: https://i.imgur.com/asm3I.jpg
[20:05:08] <nullrend> LMAOOOO
[20:05:16] <Hunterkll> that's when we just came out with the frappes 
[20:05:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:05:55] <nullrend> spellheck, cos spellcheck failed
[20:05:59] <Hunterkll> shit i still have the programming tools for the heated cabinet 
[20:06:04] <Hunterkll> multiple versions 
[20:06:11] <Hunterkll> fuck i still have spare fucking soda fountain parts
[20:06:19] <Hunterkll> and i haven't been in the mcsystem since like, 2013 
[20:06:57] <Hunterkll> I've got a notebook with built in calculator, leather bound, mcdonalds branded and red
[20:07:00] <Hunterkll> i have mcdonalds toolkits
[20:07:00] <nullrend> they're desperate for people, too
[20:07:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:07:15] <Hunterkll> "Give me $150k/yr"
[20:07:18] <Hunterkll> "Yes"
[20:07:22] <Hunterkll> me: fuck i was just joking
[20:07:52] <nullrend> oh yeah, they'll do it and come out winning cos you went low
[20:08:12] <Hunterkll> it'd be a healthy raise, but i'd be working in an 'office' again 
[20:08:25] <Hunterkll> and beholdened to metrics
[20:08:33] <Hunterkll> metrics beyond "yo you decomm any servers this week? cool"
[20:09:05] <Hunterkll> I wonder if my old OTP login still works....
[20:09:13] <Hunterkll> I still remember the local administrator password for the registers, lol
[20:09:22] <Hunterkll> used to play solitare on them during downtime xD
[20:09:32] <Hunterkll> at least, one we replaced the DOS ones with XPe ones
[20:10:30] <Hunterkll> i'll have to dig out some of my old binders and see if i still have DAR reports

[20:10:42] <Hunterkll> i know i still have some of our development agreements and tandem support agreements
[20:10:46] <nullrend> Ah, managers never let me play with the POS cos to everyone I'm just a simple cook, not fit for interaction with the guests, much less computers
[20:10:58] <Hunterkll> shit
[20:11:05] <Hunterkll> i'd call into SEI and be like
[20:11:31] <Hunterkll> "yea so we had X issue, register's already reimaged here's my OTP ID # please provide code to rejoin it to system and renumber it to correct register number"
[20:11:34] <nullrend> it took me 8 years to get this job as a server, and that was cos the bartenders are divas and don't want to serve
[20:11:44] <Hunterkll> and SEI would be like "wtf mate uhhhhh idk what to do let me check policy...."
[20:12:11] <Hunterkll> i'm just like it aint hard to take the keyboard from the ISP and hit F12 to repair a corrupted register.....
[20:12:41] <nullrend> oh, that's the kind of stuff I know how to fix mostly cosâ€¦ I have a bad habit of RTFM
[20:12:48] <nullrend> but again, not allowed near the computers
[20:13:03] <Hunterkll> nullrend: one night we were at a hackerspace, and i still had my corporate shirt/tie/tie clasp on, so i went on the expedition after the power went out to get mcdonalds food for everyone - we ordered like 100 mcdoubls, 500 nuggets, etc 
[20:13:10] <Hunterkll> at like 2am
[20:13:12] <Hunterkll> during a hurricane
[20:13:23] <Hunterkll> but
[20:13:29] <Hunterkll> the poor store had just experienced a power outage
[20:13:31] <Hunterkll> and i wanted
[20:13:32] <Hunterkll> extra sauce
[20:13:40] <Hunterkll> I walked in while we were waiting, and negotiated
[20:13:47] <Hunterkll> well, their drivethrough drink machine wasn't working!
[20:13:55] <Hunterkll> and their KVS #2 wasn't displaying orders!
[20:14:26] <Hunterkll> long story short, I rebooted register 14 to fix the drink machine, reset the unit for KVS 2, and walked out with five cases of sauce for my trouble 
[20:14:43] <nullrend> those poor employees didn't know what hit 'em, did they
[20:15:03] <Hunterkll> i walk in, a bit wet from the weather, and start talking while we're waiting for the order, i quickly notice all the problems
[20:15:06] <Hunterkll> the poor floor manager is like
[20:15:11] <Hunterkll> "uhhh how do i know you're ... "
[20:15:37] <Hunterkll> "Primary store #XXXX call AS $name check with $internal_system for validation"

[20:16:27] <Hunterkll> i go back, twiddle their shit, all systems are singing, log into the ISP with my FO credientials, fix some other shit, and yea
[20:16:34] <Hunterkll> 5 cases of sauce for our giant hurricane party
[20:16:34] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:16:41] <nullrend> they knew the devices being dead was going to take hours, if not days, to fix
[20:16:49] <Hunterkll> they weren't dead though!
[20:16:56] <Hunterkll> they were just malfunctioning
[20:17:03] <Hunterkll> and after our order, well, they were just fucked
[20:17:19] <Hunterkll> floor manager if he could have broken away, could have called SEI, and spent hours going down the checklist
[20:17:27] <nullrend> malfunctioning in a restaurant context is semantically equal to dead
[20:17:33] <Hunterkll> but the symptoms immeidately screamed "RESET KVS #2 BACK OF MONITOR UNIT, RESET REGISTER 14"
[20:18:04] <Hunterkll> you just get a feel after a while, ya know?
[20:18:18] <Hunterkll> and resetting those units, if that's *not* the issue, doesn't hurt or impact already degraded service
[20:18:35] <Hunterkll> it's the turn it off/on again method, but you have to know *what* to turn off/on again
[20:18:54] <Hunterkll> it's like that old joke, where some dude smacks something with a wrench, and charges 50 cents for hitting the thing, and $500 for knowing what part to hit
[20:19:11] <Hunterkll> back then I had an entire virtualized store on my laptop
[20:19:23] <nullrend> oooh my coworkers hate it when I use that joke on them

[20:19:58] <Hunterkll> I may be .... almost .... 9 years out of practice
[20:20:09] <Hunterkll> but i could slot right back in and beat you down with the O&T hardcore
[20:20:14] <nullrend> ah, that reminds me I need to block his cellphone from the network
[20:20:21] <nullrend> just because I can
[20:20:23] <Hunterkll> all i'd need to see is the current SOCs 
[20:20:33] <Hunterkll> to know the current products
[20:20:34] <Hunterkll> and that's it
[20:20:42] <Hunterkll> game over, you're not as fast as me
[20:22:10] <nullrend> djBartender gets mad at me cos I don't add his cocktail inventions to the menu. He truly believes he's the first one to ever come up with a mojito where you sub the rum with gin
