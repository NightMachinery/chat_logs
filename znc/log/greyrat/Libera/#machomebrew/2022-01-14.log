[20:38:33] <MetaYan> bn_work: My workaround is to install a plain certbot directly with pip, which comes with python: 'pip install certbot', but I must admit that I have no idea what kind of fantastic stuff the dependencies bring...
[20:48:14] <MetaYan> bn_work: BTW, I just removed the pip-installed certbot and installed the one from brew and it works here on 10.15.7 .
[20:51:50] <bn_work> MetaYan: really... hmm, what version of brew?
[20:52:05] <bn_work> Do you already have ncurses installed?
[21:05:49] <MetaYan> bn_work: HOMEBREW_VERSION: 3.3.10-51-g26941f0 , and ncurses 6.3 is installed.
[21:27:27] <bn_work> MetaYan:  thanks, ncurses is installed via brew?
[21:29:03] <MetaYan> bn_work: Yes.
