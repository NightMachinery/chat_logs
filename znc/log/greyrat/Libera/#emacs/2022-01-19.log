[07:04:46] <laurus> For Org mode "Results of Evaluation" (https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html), are there default values for each of the four "classes of options" (e.g., Collection)?
[07:07:24] <corwin> twb: it appears that libgmp-10.dll is required for native-comp support but not included in the build-deps script.

[07:08:08] <laurus> Emacs _29_?
[07:08:12] <corwin> I gotta kill my emacs now as it seems to hork the build if emacs (any emacs) is running when I do the --with-native-compilation build for windows.
[07:09:06] <catern> emacs 30
[07:09:33] <corwin> laurus: I'm trying to package the 28 pre-test for windows; if^Dwhen that works I'll crank out some snap-shots from master as well.  (I'm connected from 29.0.50 w/ native-comp rn, so ... I think I can, I think I can.
[07:10:01] <laurus> corwin: Oh I wasn't referring to you, I saw a Quit message that quoted 29.0.50, I didn't even know that version existed.
[07:10:08] <laurus> Thanks for help with testing!
[07:10:13] <corwin> That's a build from master :D
[07:10:33] <corwin> laurus: MP!  I'm so happy to have something that seems to be within my capabilities to help with!
[07:10:58] <laurus> corwin: I wish there were a way to donate to GNU Emacs more directly than just donating to the FSF
[07:11:20] <laurus> I would like to help fund development. I found today it's possible to donate to Org mode development directly which is awesome

[07:11:36] <laurus> Lars?
[07:11:57] <corwin> newest member of the emacs maintainer team (maybe added 1yr back or so)
[07:12:06] <laurus> I'll look into him, somehow.

[07:13:39] <corwin> On the one hand: I think RMS would say Emacs is simply a component of the GNU OS, doing to FSF is the WTG.  On the flip: I tend to agree with you, and I think many others do also.

[07:14:12] <laurus> corwin: yeah.
[07:14:39] <corwin> OK, I gotta kill all things emacs so I can kick off this build o/
