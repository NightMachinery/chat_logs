[00:00:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Note that in the U.S., by law the government in fact *cannot* do that
[00:00:06] <kuudes> well was the noncitizen resident out of the country when the rule came? was there any transition period?
[00:00:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: The U.S. government can't actually stop a U.S. citizen from re-entering the country!
[00:00:47] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, yes, I know. over here in finland the government found that sort of they can't either. nor even stop people from leaving
[00:01:12] <kuudes> they could, maybe, but it is complicated
[00:01:35] <kuudes> because already military age men are not allowed to leave the country for duration that would go over their maximum age of service until they have served
[00:01:52] <kuudes> ie you won't get a passport but up to age 27 because 28 is the last age of service
[00:02:20] <kuudes> and indeed you will be asked to be deported form other countries back home unless it is known the other country would not comply (netherlands)
[00:02:39] <kuudes> *from
[00:03:21] <kuudes> and with constitutional order the government can indeed do anything, but that requires 5/6 acceptance in parliament
[00:03:45] <kuudes> but people complain that they end up to quarantine hotels etc
[00:04:00] <kuudes> and that seems to me somewhat stupid.
[00:04:17] <kuudes> there is no promise that you will be not inconvenienced for the travel
[00:04:59] <kuudes> and indeed it seems to me that leisure travel is not a human right, even though leaving and entering your country for moving in or out is
[00:05:43] <kuudes> ie as australia did - it allowed you to exit if you were moving out for over 3 months, which is in certain international understandings the limit of permanent moving

[00:06:44] <kuudes> it just feels to me that those people who complain seem rather low intelligence to me. surely it was predictable that travelling during pandemic was nontrivial
[00:07:10] <kuudes> ggreer, omicron might be able to reinfect omicron recovered people 29 days after recovery
[00:07:28] <kuudes> so living with virus might indeed mean living with virus, concretely
[00:08:21] <kuudes> 1 month is quite short enough that the virus could make local cycles within the same city even
[00:08:42] <kuudes> norovirus seems to be able to sustain itself even though it gives about 90 days of immunity
[00:10:04] <kuudes> but like. over here in finland they separated two halves of the country from each other for a couple of weeks
[00:10:11] <kuudes> so you couldn't even move within the country.
[00:10:50] <kuudes> and if the government declares war, it can take your stuff and order you to the front to die.
[00:11:11] <ggreer> which half was the cool half? whenever you divide a country, one half ends up cooler than the other
[00:11:40] <kuudes> ggreer, yeah, a constitutional lawyer criticized the divide that it breached rights of one half, even though we don't know which one
[00:12:00] <kuudes> by forcing them to stay within the bad half
[00:12:15] <ggreer> heh

As Pariseau’s camera rolled, the monks dipped thin white sheets in the buckets, then draped the wet sheets around their backs and shoulders. They began g-tummo. In an e-mail, Pariseau recalled that he soon noticed “vapor rising

[00:29:30] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Hibernation isn’t sleep, he explained. Instead, it’s a state of “deep torpor.” The brain is active just enough to keep the animal’s heart and lungs operating. Torporous animals are far less responsive than sleeping ones. In the nineteen-sixties, one researcher removed several golden-mantled ground squirrels from their hibernation nests, tossed them in the air,
[00:29:30] <feepbot> and put them back; the animals stirred briefly during the event but returned to torpor within a day. He took the squirrels from their nests a second time and tossed them in the air again. This time, the animals only sometimes stirred, and their brain temperatures remained near forty degrees the whole time. Having learned that the sensation posed no threat, they stayed in
[00:29:30] <feepbot> torpor—some through a hundred throws.'
[00:33:50] <gwern> 'After the regular 12-day to 14-day pattern of continuous hibernation had been established, several hibernating animals were removed from their nests, tossed once 2 to 3 ft in the air, caught, returned to their nests and the sawdust replaced in a pyramid on their dorsal surface. Such a stimulus invariably caused the animals to arouse as evidenced by observing them in the state of arousal some...
[00:33:56] <gwern> ...hours later or by the absence on the following day of the sawdust, which was then replaced on the animal that had re-entered hibernation. Using this procedure animals were stimulated daily until it was found that they responded to such a stimulus by not arousing until the next normal arousal was due. This clearly indicated that the animalswere being habituated to the tactile stimulus while...
[00:34:02] <gwern> ...in hibernation, and subsequently the daily "tossings" were increased gradually until it became possible to repeat this procedure 100 times without causing the animal to arouse from hibernation.

[00:59:00] <quanticle> Yeah, I was listening to the Lawfare podcast on that. The court judgement was against the Taliban, but it had no effect because the Taliban had no assets in US jurisdiction. Well, now they've conquered Afghanistan and are claiming the money stored on the behalf of the government of Afghanistan in the NY Federal Reserve.

[01:00:43] <quanticle> Indeed
[01:03:12] <quanticle> And for what it's worth, the Biden administration's strategy has been to hive off half the money to pay for compensatory damages from the summary judgements (but not punitive damages), and send the rest to a trust that will distribute it to Afghans via approved charities. They're being pilloried for this as "looting money from starving Afghans", but that's the opposite of what they're doing. If

[01:38:02] <quanticle> Well, like I said above, the 9/11 plaintiffs already have summary judgements against the Taliban. It's just that the calculation of damages was deferred because the Taliban didn't have any assets in the US.

[01:39:07] <quanticle> He couldn't have capped those damages at zero (i.e. reserving all of the money for Afghans) because it's likely that the 9/11 lawsuit plaintiffs would have got an injunction saying that was illegal for the government to do under the Takings Act.

[02:08:28] <quanticle> Fukushima was a power plant; it didn't have anything to do with making bombs
[02:08:38] <gwern> what did fukushima have to do with bombs rather than ancient outdated known-unsafe plants?
[02:08:42] <kuudes> iirc not true
[02:09:10] <kuudes> tokaimura didn't have technically nothing to do with bombs either, it is just a spent fuel reprocessing facility
[02:09:24] <mst> is the theory here that you can design reactors in a way that their by products may be useful for weapons manufacture, and countries do that, but designing them so that isn't the case is safer? I can sort of see the idea if I squint but I'd want citations before actually believing it
[02:09:24] <kuudes> but the problem is that they keep the fuel hot so that they have the option to make warheads
[02:09:35] <kuudes> mst, yeah, afaik
[02:09:57] <quanticle> Yeah, but spent fuel reprocessing is something that can reasonably be argued as being dual-use. You can't make that argument for Three Mile Island, Fukushima or even Chernobyl. Those three were power plants, plain and simple.
[02:10:05] <kuudes> basicly you need to plan for nuclear material flows you could tap into to make warheads
[02:10:14] <kuudes> chernobyl was warhead plant
[02:10:17] <mst> I am unwilling to rule the possibility out entirely but I am significantly skeptical
[02:10:20] <kuudes> power was a side use
[02:10:31] <kuudes> three mile island I am not sure
[02:11:29] <quanticle> mst: It's more like, you can design reactors that are ridiculously more efficient than reactors today, which produce waste that is much less radioactive than today's designs, but in order to do so, you have to engage in spent fuel reprocessing, and no one wants that because the equipment you use to reprocess spent fuel is the same equipment you use to enrich nuclear material for nuclear weapons.
[02:11:57] <kuudes> well, you can integrate that into the plant itself
[02:12:08] <kuudes> but then you won't have the flows you could tap to make warheads out of
[02:12:52] <kuudes> like, you can make the system so that if the parameters for the fission get hot, the fission slows down and stops
[02:12:54] <kuudes> etc
[02:13:02] <kuudes> chernobyl was not like that
[02:13:16] <kuudes> because its primary function was to enrich warhead material
[02:13:19] <quanticle> kuudes: The RBMK reactor in Chernobyl was unsuited for warhead production
[02:13:21] <mst> bah
[02:13:30] <kuudes> afaik no
[02:13:30] <quanticle> It wasn't a breeder reactor
[02:13:46] <mst> I actually know a nuclear engineer but only because we kept running into each other in a particular pub ... and said pub got killed by covid
[02:14:01] <kuudes> I am in the understanding that you don't need a breeder reactor for nukes
[02:14:11] <mst> he was a foosball fanatic and my new home pub has pool tables instead :(
[02:14:12] <kuudes> but I am not an expert on the domain
[02:14:24] <kuudes> I am just retelling what the nuclear power expert told me
[02:14:48] <kuudes> could be he is mistaken, but it seems unlikely, as it is really his job
[02:15:41] <kuudes> mst, sounds a nice chap :)
[02:16:35] <mst> kuudes: great bloke, worked up the road at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysham_nuclear_power_station

The site is divided into two separately-managed nuclear power stations, Heysham 1 and Heysham 2, both with two reactors of the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) type.)
[02:19:13] <kuudes> but yes, japan is not north korea. north korea has actual warheads it can use. not many, but clearly at least 1
[02:19:40] <kuudes> afaik iran has aimed to become sort of like japan, but israel has not liked that
[02:20:29] <mst> also having discovered I liked foosball he periodically invited me to be the fourth person in doubles matches and then -heavily- critiqued my technique
[02:20:55] <mst> which was fantastic because I'm just about not totally terrible and he's really fucking good so I improved a lot in the process

[02:32:26] <PlanckWalk> It might have an effect sure, but the primary cause?
[02:35:01] <PlanckWalk> That would require a large fraction of the unemployed to be addicted to drugs to the point of being unemployable.

[02:36:30] <PlanckWalk> I can imagine a world in which that is true, but I don't think it's this one.
[02:36:57] <quanticle> PlanckWalk: Have you been to rural... anywhere lately?
[02:37:03] <PlanckWalk> I live in rural anywhere
[02:38:03] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, there's a fair bit of drug use.  It hasn't recently increased, and most of them have jobs.
[02:38:22] <quanticle> I think a large fraction of the currently unemployed are sufficiently addicted to drugs to be unemployable. Remember: right now unemployment is below 5%. Pretty much everyone who has a job and is employable can find a job. If you want to bring in more workers, you have to increase the labor force participation rate, which has been declining for some time now.

[02:41:25] <kuudes> PlanckWalk, are you in usa?
[02:41:28] <PlanckWalk> No
[02:41:33] <kuudes> usa is an anomaly
[02:41:37] <kuudes> it is not elsewhere
[02:41:43] <kuudes> but usa has an acute weird thing
[02:41:46] <PlanckWalk> It's quite possible that USA unemployed are in fact hopeless drug addicts
[02:41:49] <kuudes> yes
[02:41:51] <mst> 'anomaly' is probably the nicest description I've heard of it in a while
[02:41:55] <quanticle> lol
[02:42:26] <kuudes> ourworldindata has also drug section and it shows that usa has very noticeably different level of drug problem than any other country
[02:42:39] <quanticle> Right, that's the thing: the US has a pretty hot job market, but due to both demographic and the aforementioned substance abuse problems, there's a cap on the supply of suitable workers. Hence shortages.

[02:44:58] <quanticle> Well, you can want a job and still not get any because all the companies in the are insist on pee tests that you can't pass.
[02:45:11] <gwern> they've had time to grudgingly drop those
[02:45:23] <quanticle> Have they? I haven't seen much evidence of it.
[02:46:24] <gwern> I dunno. but they've had the time, so presumably the tests either really are needed or they are incompetent and their self-inflicted labor shortage will help squeeze them out of existence and be replaced by employers not so requiring
[02:46:25] <PlanckWalk> Ah yeah, looks like US has twice the impairment from drug use as Australia
[02:46:30] <quanticle> Like, I think this is one of the disagreements that I have with PlanckWalk. I think they think that "addicted to the point of being unemployable" means being stoned out of your mind 24/7. I think it means having used drugs any time in the past week and thus not being able to pass a urine test.
[02:47:14] <PlanckWalk> Could be, sure.  Urine testing is almost nonexistent here.
[02:47:18] <quanticle> Like, you smoked a joint last weekend. Congratulations, you are now unemployable (for the next week)
[02:47:56] <PlanckWalk> I wasn't intending to imply "stoned 24/7" or anything like that
[02:48:03] <quanticle> It's pervasive here. Even for higher status positions, taking a pee test isn't unheard of.
[02:48:15] <PlanckWalk> As I said, I live in an area that has higher than average drug use
[02:48:19] <PlanckWalk> (For Australia)
[02:48:54] <PlanckWalk> The only job where I've seen a urine test was for a job running a power plant.
[02:48:59] <quanticle> Yeah, but given that drug tests as a condition of employment aren't common, it means that "addicted to the point of being unemployable" has a far higher threshold there than it does here.
[02:49:14] <quanticle> Yeah, here it's like, even menial food service jobs require 'em
[02:50:42] <ggreer> island nations tend to be able to enforce drug laws better
[02:50:47] <ggreer> and immigration laws
[02:51:34] <PlanckWalk> quanticle: Yeah, that explains more
[02:52:02] <PlanckWalk> Not so much the effects of drug use itself as companies refusing to employ anyone who uses them.
[02:52:28] <quanticle> Which might change, but I haven't seen any evidence of that.

[05:13:06] <mst> (I mean the C code's doing, I'm still not sure what the fuck the perl code's doing and I'm increasingly suspecting neither did the author)
[05:14:39] <PapuaHardyNet> so I'm testing out parallel "if" statements. and I used a random.randint(0, 1) to either have a 0 (continue) or 1 (stop)
[05:15:04] <PapuaHardyNet> 196 * 8 times the code seems to have gotten a 0 until it got a 1 and stopped
[05:15:44] <PapuaHardyNet> ("something is wrong with your code, this is very unlikely" I know right? I'm checking)
[05:17:23] <mst> though randint depends on randrange which already got updated once in 3.2 to produce less skewed distributions according to its docs
[05:18:25] <mst> though it sounds a lot to me like you've somehow written code that only sees a 1 when it gets a floating point number sufficiently close to 1 to get rounded to it
[05:18:47] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: before doing anything else, maybe try
[05:19:10] <mst> val = 1 if random.random() > 0.5 else 0
[05:19:35] <mst> or just call random.randint() a bunch of times from your repl of choice
[05:21:43] <saturn2> parallel if statements?
[05:22:36] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: running the same JAX code across multiple connected TPU devices, each of which runs the exact same code, however, where specific computations communicate with each other
[05:22:55] <ggreer> the other advantage of e-ink is that it's a dedicated device. no notifications distracting you. no temptation to open twitter or whatever
[05:23:07] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm attempting to communicate across devices when one is done training, so every device shuts down
[05:24:50] <saturn2> where does each tpu get its entropy from?
[05:25:13] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: each TPU is its own device with its CPU and RAM and storage
[05:25:40] <saturn2> right but where does the entropy come from
[05:25:41] <PapuaHardyNet> okay I am confusing you, let me clarify
[05:26:13] <PapuaHardyNet> a TPU can be a simple hardware accelerator connected to a computer
[05:26:30] <PapuaHardyNet> a TPU VM is a TPU+CPU+RAM+storage, basically an independent system
[05:26:38] <saturn2> like are they using RDRAND or are they all identical software PRNGs?
[05:26:54] <PapuaHardyNet> huh... I did not think of that.
[05:27:01] <PapuaHardyNet> let's see what python random uses
[05:27:55] <PapuaHardyNet> " The Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively tested random number generators in existence.

[05:59:28] <ggreer> no way that breaking this norm could possibly backfire. nope. nothing to see here
[06:00:28] <ggreer> if I lived in canada I would be figuring out how to get my money out of banks
[06:00:56] <nshepperd> what norm
[06:01:41] <CoJaBo> ggreer: I've been trying to get my money out of my now-former bank for over a week now :/
[06:02:09] <ggreer> the norm of due process
[06:02:22] <CoJaBo> They suspended my account because I got a deposit.
[06:03:00] <nshepperd> there's a norm of due process for firing people?
[06:03:11] <ggreer> nshepperd: no. freezing bank accounts
[06:03:26] <ggreer> though firing people for donating to political causes is... fucking insane
[06:04:04] <nshepperd> oh
[06:04:10] <ggreer> especially when they don't do it to people who donated to actual terrorist groups. canada really went off the deep end
[06:04:14] <saturn2> it's only frozen, not gone, so no need for due process
[06:04:19] <ggreer> XD
[06:04:27] <Betawolf> you don't need to eat for a month, right?
[06:05:08] <CoJaBo> My deposit wasn't even from a terrorist or psycho-trucker group, it was from the US Treasury :/
[06:05:17] <CoJaBo> PNC. Not Even Once.
[06:05:17] <nshepperd> lol
[06:07:23] <gwern> CoJaBo: the US treasury funds some major terrorist groups like the US Air Force. and let's not even talk about how many trucks the psychos in the US Army have
[06:07:51] <gwern> a very sus funding source
[06:08:08] <gwern> did you know they funded al-qaeda?
[06:08:12] <CoJaBo> Seems so :/
[06:08:28] <CoJaBo> I still am not 100% sure why they randomly sent me like $6,000
[06:09:01] <CoJaBo> They refunded a ton of payments I made, after sending me a letter saying I wasn't eligable for such a refund
[06:09:05] <Betawolf> well, you're a terrorist, as proved by the donation, and the US funds terrorists, so...
[06:09:14] <CoJaBo> TIL I'm a terrist
[06:09:24] <Betawolf> It's always a shock
[06:09:42] <gwern> CoJaBo: it's an exhausting job. you throw the ball and they retrieve it, and they will do this for literally *hours*, they just don't get tired
[06:10:45] <CoJaBo> I vow to use these funds of unclear provenance only for the purposes of wanton destruction, corruption, and malice.
[06:11:02] * mst ponders donating $100 to CoJaBo 
[06:11:04] <CoJaBo> (I.e., giving them back to said corrupt govt when they send me the inevitable letter asking for it back)
[06:12:00] <CoJaBo> That's assuming, of course, that PNC ever gives them to me in the first place
[06:12:19] <CoJaBo> I dunno wtf I'm gonna do if they ask for it back and my accounts still frozen
[06:12:48] <mst> set their offices on fire and tell them you were trying to thaw it out
[06:12:49] <CoJaBo> I'm sure as hell not giving them $6k of my own money lol, so they'll just have to sue PNC or something
[06:13:13] <nshepperd> ggreer: seems perfectly reasonable to fire the director of communications at law enforcement for donating to anti law enforcement activity though
[06:13:21] <CoJaBo> I got my actual real money after about 20 phone calls and 6 visits to the bank
[06:13:31] * gwern remembers arriving at a dog park with a big german shepherd bursting with energy, where someone was playing fetch with their terrier. back and forth. back and forth. back and forth... an hour and a half later, the german shepherd was taking a nap and we left. the terrier was still going. back and forth. back and forth. back and forth...
[06:13:42] <CoJaBo> All that should be left in the account is that treasury deposit
[06:13:57] <CoJaBo> And I don't really care, because I suspect I won't be able to keep it anyway
[06:14:10] <CoJaBo> But I still don't want PNC to have it
[06:14:18] <Betawolf> They need that money to fight the civil liberties campaigns.
[06:14:32] <ggreer> nshepperd: ok then we also need to fire a bunch of people who donated to BLM
[06:14:39] <nshepperd> yes
[06:14:48] <mst> gwern: I mean, I agree, but mostly because I helped write the perl module that already does everything that C code does ;)
[06:14:53] <nshepperd> if they're cops, totally
[06:14:56] <ggreer> but we won't because there's a ridiculous double standard
[06:15:45] <ggreer> where we only fire cops who donate to say... kyle rittenhouse's defense fund
[06:15:54] <mst> although the BLM non-profit is nothing to do with anything that happened on the ground though, and I mean that to insult pretty much everybody involved
[06:16:01] <nshepperd> that's not even anti law enforcement activity
[06:16:06] <Betawolf> defending the innocent is very inappropriate behaviour for a cop

[06:17:35] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm surprised Canada went sideways so fast 
[06:17:49] <nshepperd> well if you're a prosecutor actually involved in the case you should probably be fired for donating to the defence fund
[06:17:52] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, there weren't even hints about anything like this
[06:17:56] <nshepperd> but otherwise nah
[06:18:33] <mst> ggreer: donation in the US to BLM is compulsory anyway, it's called federal taxes
[06:18:54] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: honestly, I've always been pretty suspicious of how free canada and the UK really are
[06:19:35] <mst> gwern: we kind of aren't, but our government has yet been sufficiently insane to stop us muddling through anyway
[06:19:44] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: the whole 'unwritten constitution' and the moralizing when comparing themselves to america and then the sheer damn number of cameras in London, prosecuting a dog for giving the nazi salute... these all smack of fairweather friends and liberty
[06:20:26] <PapuaHardyNet> huh
[06:20:35] <gwern> like how the USSR constitution gives you all these wonderful rights and freedoms compared to the US constitution, and then the reality on the ground is a *wee* bit different
[06:20:38] <mst> after the reception of the Dankula case, I doubt the crown prosecution service will be in any hurry to do something like that again
[06:21:11] <ggreer> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKZfU2qX0AIxHTy?format=jpg&name=900x900 <-- yeah the US does fund some sketchy things
[06:21:11] <Robomot> image/jpeg (750x724; 98 KB)
[06:23:17] <mst> gwern: I mean, same goes for the US constitution
[06:23:27] <CoJaBo> Remember that time the US Govt infected a whole town of people with a devastating, easily-curable disease, just to see what would happen if they didn't tell them there was a cure? ‘Murica.
[06:23:46] <gwern> I think it's kinda analogous to how enemies keep underestimating the US's warfighting and reform capabilities ('you can always count on the americans to do the right thing after trying everything else'), and overestimating the US's racism and sexism etc. essentially, we air our dirty laundry and do things so much more explicitly than other countries do.
[06:24:09] <mst> gwern: so, basically, yes, you're 100% correct in theory, but in practice while it has -many- flaws I prefer the reality on the ground here on the whole
[06:25:00] <nshepperd> America has an unwritten constitution consisting of whatever the supreme court feels like ruling
[06:25:03] <gwern> canadians are discovering that for all the talk and assumptions about how they had a rule of law compared to *hiss* donald trump amerikkkaland, the substance under the surface turns out to be pretty minimal; meanwhile in the US, the surface and substance much more closely coincide
[06:26:15] <mst> given the existence of civil asset forfeiture and qualified immunity, I disagree with everything after the semicolon
[06:26:33] <gwern> or take racism. 'oh my god, america is the most racist country in the world!' while the immigrants come and realize it's incredibly unracist. japanese will read their nikkei and cluck, and then go hire a PI to make sure the woman dating their son doesn't have any burakumin blood at least 5 generations back
[06:26:51] <saturn2> the us has asset forfeiture that doesn't even require a declared emergency (even though we now have about 50 of those perpetually going on)
[06:27:47] <mst> though the stupidest bit of racism I recall happening directly to a friend of mine was a chinese singaporean ex-gf of mine whose mother went *batshit* when she started dating an indonesian boy
[06:27:49] <saturn2> the racism thing is true though
[06:27:54] <Betawolf> the idea that cops would just confiscate your cash because you have a lot of it, and then sue the pile of cash, is hilariously dystopian
[06:29:22] <gwern> the racism and other stuff is very fish/water. groups can do an excellent job of suppressing this stuff. I wonder how many amish, for example, are convinced that 'the english' are rife with child molesters and rapists and incest?
[06:29:45] <PapuaHardyNet> man, asian racism is mostly "hate the poor and darker asians", and this is recursive
[06:30:50] <PapuaHardyNet> but yes, this whole canadian controversy is very interesting

[07:27:45] <gwern> I was entertaining some pretty baroque designs for how to parse abstracts and sectionize them to avoid any unintended rewrites and then I realized that I could just strip newlines and test equality

[07:34:44] <saturn2> can a wizard crack public key crypto though?
[07:35:33] <quanticle> gwern: I'm assuming that in this setting there would be some kind of magic binding that tied the spell immutably to the blockchain.
[07:35:55] <quanticle> Thus neatly avoiding the oracle problems and hacky links to real world legal systems that blockchain property requires in our world.
[07:36:48] <quanticle> (inb4 it turns out that wizard towers are giant cooling towers for the magically infused ASICs mining spells in the basement)
[07:37:10] <saturn2> seems like there's probably some combination of spells that would give you a hypercomputer
[07:38:04] <quanticle> Sure, but the answer to magic is always more magic; thus I'm sure that there are hypercomputer resistant encryption systems that can be devised.
[07:39:13] <saturn2> i don't think that's possible

[07:40:31] <gwern> how would a hypercomputer defeat a one-time pad?
[07:40:55] <quanticle> How would you make a blockchain out of a one-time pad?
[07:41:42] <gwern> (and hypercomputers are part of a computability hierarchy so they need an oracle to solve problems posed by hypercomputers to get to the next level, which then has its own halting problem and so on)
[07:42:26] <gwern> quanticle: gotta start somewhere. if even one-time pads don't work..
[07:42:36] <quanticle> True
[07:42:57] <saturn2> you would be left with only information-theoretically secure algorithms like one-time pad
[07:43:55] <nshepperd2> (the magical blockchain is secured by sacrifice of vampires, whose value is determined by their distance in the blood lineage from the master or "genesis" vampire. this is called proof of stake)
[07:46:22] <saturn2> i don't know if hyper-crypto has been shown to exist... just the halting problem by itself doesn't give you cryptography
[07:48:13] <quanticle> No, you need P != NP to get cryptography
[07:48:32] <quanticle> You need a theory of computational complexity, as well as a theory of computability

[09:07:28] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, so for the past year I was obsessed with getting an RTX 3090, but not at scalper prices. This was because only the 3090 could run GPT-J-6B.
[09:08:19] <PapuaHardyNet> With the advent of 20B, and the clear sign that consumer hardware will not keep up with large language models, I've lost most of my desire for a workstation.
[09:09:08] <PapuaHardyNet> fun fact: 20B requires ~45GB of GPU memory just to run inference
[09:10:27] <PapuaHardyNet> but hey - you can run inference on CPU if you have 64GB of RAM! (I wonder what the latency will be for inference)
[09:13:13] <PapuaHardyNet> well all right. You can run it on consumer GPUs if you have a pair of 3090s. I forgot about NVLink

[09:30:30] <quanticle> I have italics again

[10:07:09] <PapuaHardyNet> quanticle: I'm curious if you have a strategy to preven this from happening again

[10:10:15] <PapuaHardyNet> that's great to hear :)
[10:10:19] <PapuaHardyNet> what I do is I make flashcards
[10:10:19] <quanticle> So if this happens again, I grep my emacs notes for "italics"
[10:10:33] <quanticle> Well, I don't need to *memorize* this solution
[10:10:50] <quanticle> I just need to be able to have a note that I can grep for
[10:11:06] <PapuaHardyNet> I know, I just don't trust in my ability to know when to grep
[10:11:39] <quanticle> Oh, I always grep
[10:11:43] <quanticle> Always be greppin'
[10:12:21] <quanticle> Like, at this point, my notes are extensive enough that if I grep for something in my notes (that I remember seeing before) and I don't find the solution, I'm vaguely disappointed
[10:12:22] <PapuaHardyNet> on the other hand, I always review flashcards.
[10:12:50] <quanticle> Yeah, but that takes a whole lot more time than building up the habit of grepping your notebook
[10:12:54] <PapuaHardyNet> I hope you have extensive backups of your notes!
[10:13:01] <quanticle> It's a git repo
[10:13:09] <quanticle> It's backed up to Github
[10:13:13] <quanticle> And to my server
[10:13:18] <PapuaHardyNet> good to hear
[10:13:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I only have local backups of my notes and flashcards
[10:13:56] <PapuaHardyNet> (I do have an rsync.net 200GB storage but I just bought it and never used it)
[10:14:49] <quanticle> Yeah, I don't have a lot of images or other binary files in my notes, which helps
[10:15:05] <quanticle> They're just plain text which is basically free to store
[10:59:39] <adiabatic> quanticle: actually the font cache on macOS can get stuck which is why if you're developing a font, you probably want to keep it out of fonts folders and test it out in a browser
[11:03:43] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: I'm thinking of using wandb to visualize logging the loss curve / perplexity, and spectral norm. what do you think?
[11:04:14] <PapuaHardyNet> I used to use guildAI to locally visualize this stuff but meh, I don't like setting up tensorboard over a remote and then trying to access it, especially on a distributed system
[11:04:44] <PapuaHardyNet> oh hey - I'll have to ensure that only one JAX process logs to wandb, right? this stuff gets complicated fast
[11:08:36] <nshepperd2> wandb is pretty good imo

[11:09:46] <PapuaHardyNet> how do you get the d_rank?
[11:12:06] <nshepperd2> atm i get it from an environment variable that i set manually on the workers
[11:12:23] <nshepperd2> but actually theres jax.process_index() that might work fine

[15:22:09] <kuudes> "Thus far, Ottawa Police is expecting that the total number of Freedom Convoy vehicles will top out at between 1,000 and 2,000."
[15:22:16] <two2thehead> Betawolf, yeah that's more believable
[15:22:33] <kuudes> yeah, 50k trucks sounded quite much
[15:23:09] <kuudes> "The largest truck convoy on record was set in November 2020 in Cairo, Egypt. That convoy involved 480 trucks and stretched 7.5 km (4.6 miles)."
[15:23:48] <kuudes> "Adrian Ghobrial, a reporter for the Toronto news outlet City News, said that while thousands of people have come out to watch and support the truckers as they drive by, he was skeptical that the convoy consisted of more than 100 trucks"
[15:23:57] <kuudes> "David Akin, the chief global correspondent with Global News, cited a report from the Ontario Provincial Police that 113 trucks (as well as 276 personal vehicles) were recorded coming into Thunder Bay from Winnipeg."
[15:24:29] <kuudes> "According to the Canadian Trucking Alliance, the cross-border vaccine mandate would impact about 15% (or about 16,000) of the country’s truckers. If the 50,000 truck claim is to be believed, that would mean that not only would every one of those 16,000 truckers have to participate in the event, but they’d also need to be joined by 34,000 additional trucks who weren’t impacted by the mandate."
[15:25:04] <kuudes> so random hundreds of people, that sounds believable
[15:25:21] <Betawolf> Anyway, I think 'this is a foreign operation' just sounds like something you say because you don't like them, and I've not seen anything to back it. I think some canadians just don't like mandates and are protesting.
[15:25:26] <kuudes> and it is a new thing that people try to use vehicles in their protest
[15:25:42] <kuudes> foreign gets shown by american funding.
[15:25:47] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : on the plus side, a good reason and opportunity to learn where Canada's cities are :V https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/29/07/53465557-10454333-image-a-189_1643439996483.jpg

[15:25:53] <kuudes> russian is not shown, that I agree on
[15:26:00] <kuudes> that part is suspicion
[15:26:05] <Betawolf> They've got support from Americans who also don't like mandates because they were all over the media, this isn't a surprise.
[15:26:45] <kuudes> https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/foreign-money-funding-extremism-in-canada-says-hacker
[15:26:46] <Robomot> Foreign money funding ‘extremism’ in Canada, says hacker | Canada | The Guardian (Exclusive: leak shows more than half of donations to convoy protest through GiveSendGo came from US)
[15:27:06] <kuudes> so foreign influence is clearly shown true imo
[15:27:11] <two2thehead> kuudes, yeah Canada is apparently going to update their laws to cover donation sites
[15:27:20] *** Joins: Filipepe (~Filipepe@2804:14d:5ca3:8ebe:9d44:a0d0:957a:4ed5)
[15:27:21] <Betawolf> 'foreign influence' usually means foreign governments
[15:27:30] <two2thehead> this apparently falls under the money laundering laws. Mildly interesting
[15:27:44] <kuudes> Betawolf, yes, that is harder to show directly
[15:28:11] <kuudes> but for instance usa has direct laws banning for instance finnish private persons to donate to any political party there
[15:28:19] <kuudes> because that would be foreign influence.
[15:29:00] <kuudes> and it is not usual even for private persons to send money overborder for political aims
[15:29:28] <Betawolf> but you would find it strange to say that a candidate getting such money from a private person is 'Backed by Finland', right?
[15:29:33] <Filipepe> hi all
[15:29:55] <kuudes> Betawolf, there was a case that some randos wanted to buy trump caps and first they got delivered but then they got refunded
[15:30:38] <kuudes> Betawolf, it is part of normal politics for residents of a locale being allowed to protest in the locale
[15:30:58] <kuudes> it is out of ordinary to go to other countries to protest, or to send money etc
[15:31:15] <Betawolf> If you want to say that the protests in Canada are given extra life by anti-mandate or anti-vax Americans, that seems fair, but going to 'this isn't really a protest, it's a foreign political attack' seems a leap
[15:31:16] <kuudes> a major novel thing in convoy protests is also the use of vehicles
[15:31:22] <kuudes> that seems possibly not good
[15:31:39] <kuudes> yes, I don't justify that statement as fact
[15:31:48] <kuudes> but I say that seems to me the least surprising cause
[15:32:22] <kuudes> antivaxxers are not especially bright people
[15:32:33] <kuudes> and it takes iq to organize
[15:32:52] <kuudes> like, there are not very many downs people leading movements
[15:33:04] <Betawolf> if you think opposing mandates makes you an antivaxxer, I am also an antivaxxer
[15:33:20] <kuudes> have you donated or organized protests?
[15:33:32] <Betawolf> nope, I'm not that charitable
[15:33:42] <Betawolf> but if it was my country I would have
[15:33:55] <kuudes> I guess for this I would use the surgigal tool of banning use of motor vehicles in protests.
[15:34:12] <kuudes> same as I would ban use of guns in protests
[15:34:17] *** Joins: _inky (inky_@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/inky)
[15:34:28] <Betawolf> those seem rather different
[15:34:34] <feep> yeah, that's a stretch
[15:34:36] <kuudes> not that much
[15:34:44] <feep> my theory is the point of a protest is to cause harm
[15:34:50] <kuudes> both are things that allow high energy use for a person
[15:34:54] <feep> and that this is a valid instance of democracy
[15:34:54] <kuudes> which allows mass murder
[15:35:14] <kuudes> truck terrorist attacks etc
[15:35:14] <feep> you may say that this places a thin line between protest and terrorism, and I would say yes.
[15:35:22] <Betawolf> the trucks are not being rammed into crowds or buildings
[15:35:25] <kuudes> not yet
[15:35:35] <feep> the trucks just so happen to be the main cause of economic damage here
[15:35:44] <kuudes> Betawolf, same statement holds for people having an armed march
[15:35:45] <feep> and are hard to handle for the police
[15:35:51] <kuudes> yes
[15:35:53] <feep> so you know, it seems rather convenient
[15:36:11] <feep> since the economic damage and being hard to handle is the point of not just this protest
[15:36:13] <feep> but any protest
[15:36:17] <kuudes> lets have 100 persons march in formation with rifles as a protest, is that nice?
[15:36:32] <kuudes> they are not doing any harm
[15:36:42] <feep> in this case trucks have a dual use
[15:36:47] <kuudes> yes
[15:36:49] <Betawolf> if they're allowed to carry rifles then they should be allowed to carry rifles. Telling people they can't do ordinary things because they're protesting is chilling.
[15:36:49] <feep> guns do not have a dual use for economic damage
[15:37:04] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: so you can do jnp.mean(array, axis=(0, 2)) but you cannot do jnp.average(array, axis=(0, 2)) lmao
[15:37:12] <PapuaHardyNet> also both work in numpy so seems like a genuine bug
[15:37:16] <kuudes> Betawolf, I am in locale where you certainly are not allowed to carry guns as normal person
[15:37:28] <feep> kuudes: the point is that it must be possible for the protest to nonviolently cause economic damage.
[15:37:35] <Betawolf> right, then you wouldn't need to ban _carrying guns in a protest_ specifically
[15:37:42] <feep> when all avenues for this are removed, it becomes valid to violently cause economic damage
[15:37:46] <kuudes> trucks require a licence
[15:38:01] <kuudes> so I am fine with amending the traffic laws so that trucks can't be used for protests
[15:38:08] <feep> so if you forbid trucks and the next time 100 people show up marching with guns, I would have to approve.
[15:38:13] <kuudes> feep, you can go sit on the road
[15:38:16] <kuudes> that is still valid
[15:38:26] <feep> the economic damage this does is minimal
[15:38:29] <feep> since you can be removed
[15:38:35] <feep> if it's trees, you can chain yourself to them
[15:38:36] <kuudes> you are not allowed to block roads.
[15:38:37] <Betawolf> this seems not far from "I'm sorry, you can't have employment while protesting."
[15:38:39] <feep> you cannot chain yourself to a road
[15:38:47] <feep> you *must* be allowed to block roads.
[15:38:50] <kuudes> no
[15:38:53] <feep> roads are the arteries of commerce
[15:38:59] <feep> it's the primary way of causing economic harm
[15:39:03] <kuudes> you don't have inherent right to block roads
[15:39:07] <feep> I disagree
[15:39:13] <kuudes> feel free
[15:39:13] <feep> I consider the right to block roads inherent to democracy.
[15:39:17] <kuudes> I don'
[15:39:19] <kuudes> t
[15:39:32] <feep> I think that is a sign of the decay of the left movement.
[15:39:47] <feep> say about blm what you like but they get what protests are for.
[15:40:00] <feep> and how they work.
[15:40:19] <feep> my view is that so far the truckers have been less violent than blm, and if you want to change that, validly so, feel free to forbid blocking roads with trucks.
[15:40:26] <kuudes> over here the police removes extinction rebellion people from the roads after they don't leave when ordered
[15:41:05] * feep shrugs
[15:41:14] <kuudes> they are allowed to relocate though
[15:41:21] <feep> I feel that this is the axis between america and china/taiwan, and I prefer the america side
[15:41:26] <kuudes> so the police has indeed negotiated with them to block another road
[15:41:37] <kuudes> but when they moved back, then they got removed
[15:41:45] <feep> kuudes: that is ... do you not see that this is 1:1 to placing a "free speech zone"
[15:41:46] <kuudes> when police maced them, that got some talk though
[15:41:56] <feep> if you do not have the ability to cause damage, then you are not sovereign.
[15:42:01] <kuudes> sure.
[15:42:04] <Betawolf> I find it hilarious that they are allowed to be disruptive where it doesn't matter.
[15:42:10] <kuudes> you have right to picket, you don't have right to harm others
[15:42:15] <feep> yeah, that's what I mean by the decay of leftist movements.
[15:42:18] <feep> I disagree
[15:42:36] <feep> imo you have the natural right to prevent others from profiting by obstruction.
[15:42:42] <kuudes> you have right to passive resistance, not active resistance
[15:42:55] <feep> I view the right to passive resistance with a very wide view of passivity.
[15:42:57] <kuudes> police has the rightful monopoly of violence and they have right to defend the society
[15:43:00] <feep> trucks parked on the road are passive.
[15:43:11] <feep> the society *is* the people. truckers are society.
[15:43:28] <capisce> why should random people be allowed to cause economic damage?
[15:43:41] <kuudes> the society has right to cancel their licences
[15:43:54] <feep> society is an attempt to channel human instincts into beneficial paths
[15:43:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: How come the sample link for a .epub gets the link-pdf class...?
[15:44:09] <feep> a core human instinct is the idea that you are being taken advantage of, or that you are being bullied
[15:44:12] <feep> the reaction to this is violence
[15:44:23] <kuudes> no one has right to violence
[15:44:26] <feep> society must prevent the appearance of advantage-taking or bullying
[15:44:37] <feep> the sovereign has the right to violence
[15:44:41] <feep> this right is *ceded* to the state
[15:44:48] <kuudes> then people are not sovereign imo
[15:45:04] <feep> the people, being the sovereign, have the inherent right to violence.
[15:45:07] <kuudes> no
[15:45:09] <feep> this is the natural state.
[15:45:19] <kuudes> ok, I side with the police in this
[15:45:27] <feep> where do you think the state monopoly on violence comes from?
[15:45:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep is correct
[15:45:44] <feep> from whom is the monopoly taken?
[15:45:48] <kuudes> if you default on free-on-all, I side the majority.
[15:45:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although note that this is the case only in republican, and not in autocratic, forms of state)
[15:46:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is irrelevant in practice because all modern states are republican in form)
[15:46:08] <feep> the entire point of democracy is *improving* on mob rule.
[15:46:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But noting for completeness)
[15:46:20] <feep> the point of a protest is that it is a mob who disagrees that society has improved on it.
[15:46:45] <feep> this is why society must be better than the natural state for any conceivable mob.
[15:46:54] <kuudes> they are free to sue the state or the city on the vaccine mandates if they see those against basic rights
[15:46:59] <feep> the tool to demonstrate that this condition is violated is you grab some buddies and form a mob.
[15:47:01] <kuudes> and if they are correct, the courts will back them
[15:47:10] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[15:47:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: And if the courts are corrupt and the state is corrupt, what then?
[15:47:21] <capisce> but isn't the premise that the mobs are rational?
[15:47:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Have the people no rights, then, in your view?
[15:47:30] <feep> capisce: not at all
[15:47:31] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, then you should likely leave the first instance you can
[15:47:40] <feep> capisce: this is why I said the role of the state is to avoid the *appearance* of bullying.
[15:47:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: If the state prevents you from leaving?
[15:47:42] <kuudes> don't live in dictature
[15:47:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Then what?
[15:47:50] <feep> canada has failed this, which is why they have this issue.
[15:47:51] <kuudes> does canada?
[15:47:53] <capisce> so what do you do with a hypothetical mob that feels bullied in any situation?
[15:48:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Not the point. Asking in general. If - then?
[15:48:10] <kuudes> I don't answer for hypothetical
[15:48:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why?
[15:48:18] <feep> capisce: well, note that under this view, the right to corporate speech is less relevant
[15:48:19] <kuudes> because I do not.
[15:48:25] <feep> capisce: so personally I would destroy twitter
[15:48:36] <feep> that would probably fix it
[15:48:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Then your point is invalidated and you are demonstrated to be wrong. QED.
[15:48:42] <kuudes> no you
[15:48:55] <feep> that aside, I think if you are in that situation you are looking at decades of failure
[15:49:07] <feep> and you need to go back to the drawing board to figure out how to improve on the mob state for this mob.
[15:49:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: But here is a less principled answer: leave? And go where? If *all* available locations are ruled by states that are corrupt - then what?
[15:49:17] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, what if omega says you are wrong
[15:49:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Then... I don't care? Who cares what Omega says?
[15:49:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is that relevant
[15:49:41] <kuudes> yes, the same
[15:49:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> n..no?
[15:49:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf?
[15:49:49] <feep> capisce: for instance, you could consider negotiating concessions.
[15:49:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> How is that... analogous at all
[15:50:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I *am* answering your hypothetical
[15:50:06] <feep> that is, as I take it, usually what democractic states do in that situation.

[15:50:32] <PapuaHardyNet> huh?
[15:50:33] <capisce> it seems like a slippery slope if any random group can get something just by the threat of violence
[15:50:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I'm not asking a hypothetical anymore
[15:50:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm asking about the real world
[15:50:41] <feep> capisce: now the problem is that sometimes this makes another group get bullied
[15:50:45] <feep> then we can get societal failure
[15:50:54] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, I don't want to talk with you on this, sorry.
[15:51:01] <feep> however, I consider this better than the alternatives.
[15:51:04] <kuudes> I appreciate you as a person though
[15:51:21] <kuudes> but I feel that per past interactions our communication will not manage in this
[15:51:36] <capisce> like what if some small group decides that they don't agree with the concept of property ownership?
[15:51:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: I think it's obvious to everyone that your response is due to you clearly having no answer to my very obviously correct argument
[15:51:46] <kuudes> I understand you will not understand me nor want to understand me, and I respect that opinion of yours
[15:51:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, I understand you quite well
[15:52:00] <kuudes> please stop?
[15:52:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> And you understand me too, in fact!
[15:52:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> You just don't want to admit it
[15:52:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> But sure
[15:52:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's stop
[15:52:15] <kuudes> thanks
[15:52:19] <feep> capisce: usually you get leftist communes
[15:52:27] <feep> that are a bit bullied by the state but mostly left alone
[15:52:38] <feep> and the balance and goal here is to remind them of how shit the natural state is.
[15:52:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, kuudes aside, here is my larger point:
[15:52:58] <kuudes> over here clearly parties have been able to sue the state and the city
[15:53:06] <kuudes> and they have won, when law has indeed said they are right
[15:53:21] <kuudes> thereby it seems clear to me that at least in finland courts are not corrupt
[15:53:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Protest peacefully / use other legal methods of grievance is the only thing you have a right to do" is a principle that breaks down *instantly* the moment that the state *prevents* your peaceful protest from having any effect, *which it can trivially do*
[15:53:45] <kuudes> and indeed if the antivaxmandate people want to say the state is doing wrong, they should sue the state and not block roads with trucks
[15:53:51] <capisce> feep: right, but what if those people decide to cause economic damage to the system until the concept of property is abolished at large?
[15:53:55] <feep> capisce: remember that the state also has to get the non-communists to not feel bullied by the communists.
[15:54:02] <feep> it's a tradeoff.
[15:54:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a completely unsustainable principle
[15:54:15] <feep> if they can form a long-term sustained mob, the state will have to cede ground to them
[15:54:27] <feep> this seeks for equilibrium
[15:54:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> It boils down, in other words, to "you have rights only so long as the state deigns to permit it"
[15:54:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course, one can take that stance honestly and explicitly!
[15:54:52] <capisce> or, as usually happens, the state can arrest them and constrain their freedom of movement
[15:54:53] <feep> capisce: usually what happens is that you just don't get large, violent, organized mobs.
[15:55:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then one can't claim to be a supporter of democracy, humanism, etc.
[15:55:03] <feep> yes, but there's a capacity limit
[15:55:17] <capisce> so this is only for sufficiently large mobs then
[15:55:21] <feep> when I talk about a mob, usually this is a group large enough to outscale local carceral capacity
[15:55:37] <feep> note that large carceral capacity imposes its own bullying cost
[15:55:38] <kuudes> feep, so the sovereign citizens in germany are correct?
[15:55:49] <feep> kuudes: no, they're crazy.
[15:55:49] <kuudes> the german state has no right to ban them from showing swastikas?
[15:56:16] <feep> kuudes: they're specifically crazy in that they don't take their views far enough, weirdly
[15:56:31] <feep> like, they think there's a "weird hack" to sovereignty that the state has to permit.
[15:56:44] <feep> the power of sovereignty is to *make* the state permit it.
[15:57:29] <feep> and the state's goal in the game is to be visibly better than this option.
[15:57:32] <kuudes> I guess my point is that I allow people the power they can exert with their passive bodies
[15:57:36] <kuudes> but little more than that
[15:57:44] <feep> and my point is that it is irrelevant what you allow.
[15:57:51] <feep> except inside the framework.
[15:57:57] <kuudes> it is ok if you go lie on the road, it is not ok you build fortification on the road
[15:58:11] <feep> and that the framework itself is a negotiated peace
[15:58:21] <feep> that, if one side is seen to defect from it, can fail, locally or globally.
[15:58:36] <kuudes> maybe so
[15:58:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unusually, I agree with feep entirely; his analysis of this is spot-on
[15:59:03] <kuudes> in the specific case of freedom convoy thing, I am in the opinion of that it is ok for state to remove the trucks
[15:59:04] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[15:59:05] <feep> I mean, let me be clear, I like this framework, I enjoy living in it
[15:59:40] <feep> kuudes: right, I'm just saying that ... like, forbidding trucks in protests entirely misses the point of protests as a *reminder to the state* that the framework is malleable.
[15:59:48] <feep> and, ultimately, voluntary.
[15:59:49] <kuudes> and I don't see truck driving as an inherent human right - if I did, I should protest truck licences as well
[16:00:12] <feep> I'm not defending truck driving as an inherent right
[16:00:12] <kuudes> I am not claiming this follows random declarations of global rules
[16:00:20] <feep> I am defending physical obstruction as a tool of resistance.
[16:00:32] <kuudes> I am saying state force against convoy protests, as much as I see it, seems prudent
[16:00:41] * feep shrugs
[16:00:44] <feep> it's prudent if it works.
[16:00:54] <kuudes> and I don't take point of opinion on many supposed larger effects
[16:00:55] <kuudes> and I don't
[16:00:57] <kuudes> have to
[16:01:05] <kuudes> as you guys have explained
[16:01:11] <feep> radical freedom :D
[16:01:16] <kuudes> you have no right to demand me taking such an opinion
[16:01:21] <feep> kuudes: actually, freenode is a great example of this
[16:01:48] <feep> there was an accepted framework, and the "state power" was seen to defect from that framework
[16:02:00] <feep> so the framework was abolished by the other participants and reorganized anew in another place.
[16:02:08] <feep> this took no rights or consent.
[16:02:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep good example
[16:02:22] <kuudes> yes and people are free to leave canada
[16:02:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> As Moldbug says
[16:02:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is exactly one thing that makes right
[16:02:33] <kuudes> are they not free to leave canada?
[16:02:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that is might
[16:02:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And go where?
[16:02:48] <kuudes> out
[16:02:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where?
[16:02:52] <feep> eh, I don't believe in exit as a right, or rather, the notion of exit as a right is founded inside the framework
[16:02:54] <kuudes> not canada
[16:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Into the ocean?
[16:02:54] <feep> exit is a remedy.
[16:03:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where specifically should they go? Give some examples
[16:03:07] <kuudes> I don't have to
[16:03:08] <feep> it may not be the worst, it may not be the best.
[16:03:11] <feep> protest is another.
[16:03:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, you do have to
[16:03:13] <kuudes> no
[16:03:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because if there's no "out" they can go to, then they can't go "out"
[16:03:27] <Betawolf> they are in fact not free to leave if they are unvaccinated, they are banned from all travel
[16:03:29] <feep> they will go outside the environment.
[16:03:42] <kuudes> canada does not prevent them, does it?
[16:03:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's an extremely dumb position to take to say "they can go out" but then to refuse to consider where exactly that "out" can be
[16:03:47] <kuudes> they can live in the border zone
[16:03:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> What border zone
[16:03:58] <kuudes> us-canada?
[16:04:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no such zone
[16:04:06] <kuudes> weird
[16:04:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where did you get this bizarre idea
[16:04:11] <feep> the border has measure zero
[16:04:15] <Betawolf> they cannot get on planes or trains to get to the border area, or drive because their licenses are revoked
[16:04:22] <Betawolf> or pay others because their accounts are frozen
[16:04:23] <kuudes> they can walk
[16:04:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where?
[16:04:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> The U.S.? They can't
[16:04:33] <feep> kuudes is slowly reconstructing the march of tears here
[16:04:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> And Canada borders no other countries
[16:04:46] <kuudes> I guess canada and usa have the same border office?
[16:04:55] <kuudes> do they have the same exact border fence?
[16:05:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no fence
[16:05:01] <feep> yes!
[16:05:04] <Betawolf> if your concept of rights is 'you have legs still' then it's a shallow one indeed
[16:05:07] <feep> or rather, the same definition
[16:05:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes where do you get these weird ideas, lol
[16:05:21] <feep> yeah this is a sovereign citizen level take
[16:05:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Quite
[16:05:55] <feep> regardless, that's not the important part!
[16:06:26] <feep> even if they could leave, again, the notion of exit as a compelled first thing to try is pragmatic, not formal
[16:06:46] <capisce> they could sail to see if the Sentinelese will welcome them after having heard their plight
[16:06:47] <feep> exit is, usually, easier and cheaper than resistance, but there is no inherent reason to require it as the first option
[16:07:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here is a picture of the U.S.-Canada border
[16:07:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.ohscanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/US-Border-GrahamAdobe-Stock.jpeg

[16:07:13] <feep> for instance, while the east german protests were ostensibly about the right to exit, there was a countermovement for internal reform
[16:07:27] <feep> and this would have been no less valid if exit was available.

[16:07:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok?
[16:07:59] <kuudes> I am referring the area behind border checkpoint and before the other country's border checkpoint
[16:08:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not a thing here
[16:08:30] <kuudes> usa's and canada's border fence must be the same physical thing then?
[16:08:30] <feep> it's america. if it was, there'd be a state there
[16:08:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: THERE IS NO FENCE
[16:09:03] <kuudes> feep, east germans did not have a right to exit
[16:09:14] <kuudes> their state prosecuted them if they tried to
[16:09:21] <feep> correct, within the framework there was no right to exit
[16:09:27] <feep> and outside the framework there was no power for exit
[16:09:37] <feep> because the state was autocratic and had taken this power by force
[16:09:49] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, so, does canada prevent them from leaving?
[16:09:59] <feep> my point is, even if there *had* been a right, peopl would not have been compelled to take it rather than protest internally.
[16:10:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... the U.S. prevents them from entering
[16:10:11] <kuudes> yeah, that is often the case
[16:10:17] <kuudes> but then it is not canada's fault
[16:10:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is *the same thing* as them being unable to leave Canada, because there is no place between the U.S. and Canada
[16:10:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> you see?
[16:10:26] <feep> and even while people fought for that right, other people fought for a different goal.
[16:10:33] <kuudes> canada is not threatening their basic right to leave the country
[16:10:39] <kuudes> leaving your country is a human right
[16:10:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, but *where can they go*?
[16:10:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Specifically? Where?
[16:10:48] <feep> kuudes: human rights are a *frame*.
[16:10:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not the U.S.!
[16:10:52] <kuudes> they could swim to hans island I suppose
[16:10:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> ...
[16:10:56] <kuudes> to denmark
[16:10:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[16:11:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Swim to Denmark
[16:11:03] <kuudes> I don't think denmark has a border post there
[16:11:10] <feep> the action of a state is to exert frame control in order to make this frame appear universal
[16:11:12] <feep> but it is not.
[16:11:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> What a supporter of human rights you are
[16:11:25] <kuudes> but yes, it is not canada's problem if other countries won't accept them
[16:11:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[16:11:38] <kuudes> but usa has human right duty to inspect their cause for asylum
[16:11:47] <feep> this is "human rights as seen by a paperclipper" tier logic tho
[16:11:47] <kuudes> does usa not do that?
[16:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> no lol
[16:12:02] <kuudes> ok, usa is breaching their human rights
[16:12:05] <feep> usa dont give a fuck
[16:12:11] <kuudes> yes, usa is bad
[16:12:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Great
[16:12:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> So now we've found a way to blame some other state - not theirs - but someone else
[16:12:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now
[16:12:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> What recourse have they?
[16:12:42] <capisce> https://psyche.co/ideas/why-we-shouldnt-push-a-positive-mindset-on-those-in-poverty
[16:12:43] <Robomot> Why we shouldn’t push a positive mindset on those in poverty | Psyche Ideas (Living in poverty is not caused by a faulty mindset, it’s a response to scarcity and marginalisation)
[16:12:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> They can't protest in the U.S. because they can't enter the U.S.
[16:12:52] <kuudes> if a person comes to finnish border and claims asylum, it is finland's duty to take them in and investigate if they have right to asylum
[16:12:53] <capisce> "There’s one problem: mindsets are not free-floating. They are neither optional strategies that everyone can freely adopt nor value-neutral ways of enhancing wellbeing. Instead, they are embedded in life conditions that have material, social and ideological dimensions, and this is just as true for those of us living in poverty as it is for the rest of us living in financial comfort."
[16:12:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> They can't protest in Canada because apparently Canada is blameless here
[16:12:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Therefore...?
[16:13:04] <kuudes> same for germany
[16:13:08] <kuudes> same for canada afaik
[16:13:10] <kuudes> same for uk
[16:13:15] <kuudes> same for even russia afaik
[16:13:19] <feep> do I need to pull out the v for vendetta speech here
[16:13:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Great, great, but then what recourse do these people have?
[16:13:26] <kuudes> and indeed same for usa, but apparently usa does not respect its duties
[16:13:32] <kuudes> they can sue usa?
[16:13:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... lol.
[16:13:38] <feep> where
[16:13:40] <feep> in what court
[16:13:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are you
[16:13:41] <kuudes> in usa?
[16:13:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> even serious here
[16:13:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like for real man
[16:13:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is this trolling
[16:13:51] <kuudes> I guess usa is not a country?
[16:13:52] * feep eyebrows
[16:13:59] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: no kuudes is just ... fully inside the human rights frame
[16:14:02] <kuudes> it does not have laws, courts?
[16:14:09] <kuudes> what
[16:14:24] <feep> I mean shit, I haven't even read leviathan
[16:14:29] <feep> but I'm starting to feel I should recommend it?
[16:14:30] <kuudes> if usa is not a country where you can sue the state, it seems quite bad
[16:14:35] <kuudes> you guys should leave
[16:14:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: This is a genuinely implausible level of ... I don't even know what to call it. Dogmatism? Willful blindness? What?
[16:14:57] <kuudes> like, you can sue germany in germany
[16:15:08] <feep> kuudes: the point is this.
[16:15:08] <Betawolf> How do you sue a country you're not in, for not letting you in?
[16:15:09] <kuudes> and I would expect that if you are right, germany will have to obey its own courts
[16:15:27] <feep> the question of what you are allowed to do, is an abstraction imposed by a concerted agreement called society
[16:15:39] <kuudes> Betawolf, with a lawyer?
[16:15:44] <feep> it is an illusion, a mask over the true question, which is: what *can* you do.
[16:15:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Just for the record, we're talking about the country that signs international human rights treaties and then completely ignores them, because its laws do not actually say that it has to obey treaties it signs
[16:16:02] <kuudes> yes, it is bad
[16:16:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: So, consider that, and then adjust your expectations accordingly
[16:16:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> When you ask questions like
[16:16:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "can they sue"
[16:16:13] <mst> Betawolf: ECHR
[16:16:24] <capisce> as you say, finland might take them in and investigate if they have a right to asylum
[16:16:32] <capisce> but they might determine that they have no such right and send them back
[16:16:36] <capisce> then they're back to square one
[16:16:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note for the record: I actually am fully in favor of the U.S.'s aforesaid stance on international treaties)
[16:16:37] <Betawolf> mst: I mean, here, yes, but we're talking about Canada.
[16:16:37] <kuudes> mst, uk is trying to leave european human rights though
[16:16:42] <kuudes> getting in line with belarus
[16:16:43] <feep> I am lucky enough to live in a country where this fundamental truth is acknowledged in the constitution
[16:16:51] <feep> which tbh everyone should ceremonially sign when they turn 18
[16:17:13] <mst> kuudes: well, yes, I'm talking about suing *them*, not *us*, clearly :P
[16:17:16] <kuudes> capisce, finland indeed has a problem that there are people in finland who have no right to be in finland but there is nowhere finland can deport them to
[16:17:17] <capisce> so what good with it do to sue the US for their right to see asylum?
[16:17:20] <capisce> *seek
[16:17:24] <kuudes> mst, indeed
[16:17:31] <two2thehead> .seen tuxedage
[16:17:32] <feepbot> two2thehead: I have last seen tuxedage 38 weeks, 6 days ago saying "LeoTal: on this channel".
[16:17:33] <feep> kuudes: it's like you are sitting inside a house, and you expect that outside the door of the house is just more living rooms.
[16:17:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Whoa whoa whoa, what's this? What's this?? "there is nowhere finland can deport them to"???
[16:17:40] <feep> no! outside of the house is the amazonian rainforest.
[16:17:42] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, yes
[16:17:45] <capisce> that doesn't guarantee that they'd be granted asylum even if there was such a process for Canadians
[16:17:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: What happened to "they can just leave", eh??
[16:17:55] <feep> you will get eaten by spiders.
[16:17:55] <kuudes> they can
[16:17:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: What happened to refusing to answer the question "leave where"!
[16:17:59] <kuudes> they don't want to
[16:18:11] <kuudes> they are free to walk to sweden and be sweden's headache
[16:18:13] <kuudes> they don't
[16:18:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Why not make them leave to the same place you said the truckers should leave Canada to, namely "out"?
[16:18:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[16:18:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where? "out"!
[16:18:27] <kuudes> finland is not imprisoning them
[16:18:38] <kuudes> in fact, finland will provide them with housing and money
[16:18:48] <feep> taking away their trucks is functionally equivalent to imprisonment for the purpose of resistance to government action
[16:18:51] <feep> this is in fact the point.
[16:18:51] <kuudes> and let them stay here, because we can't push them anywhere else
[16:19:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why can't?
[16:19:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure you can
[16:19:07] <kuudes> feep, I disagree, but I respect your point
[16:19:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Push them "out"
[16:19:12] <kuudes> that is not legal
[16:19:15] <capisce> so they're kind of lucky to not have a place they can be deported to
[16:19:18] <kuudes> finland can't break its laws
[16:19:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh it's not *legal*
[16:19:20] <capisce> bit unfair for the ones who can be deported
[16:19:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well gosh
[16:19:39] <kuudes> yes, from american pov it is weird to see countries obeying their own laws
[16:20:06] <kuudes> but similar happens in sweden, norway, germany etc
[16:20:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, not at all; it's just that you have a different set of "what laws are actually obeyed"
[16:20:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "and what laws are ignored"
[16:20:20] <kuudes> germany bribes their source countries to accept them, so that germany can deport them
[16:20:30] <kuudes> finland does not
[16:20:36] <feep> we do do this.
[16:20:48] <feep> because we are hilariously inept at integration.
[16:21:05] <kuudes> iraqians can't be deported from finland to iraq because iraq does not accept people who come involuntary and are not legally detained
[16:21:18] <tarquinius> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Böckenförde_dilemma
[16:21:18] <Robomot> Böckenförde dilemma - Wikipedia (The Böckenförde Dilemma (German: Böckenförde-Diktum) is a problem (dilemma), which claims that in secular states there are obstacles to creation of social capital.)
[16:21:29] <feep> kuudes: the point is this: what can a government do? whatever it wants. this makes it appear bullying.
[16:21:30] <kuudes> and finland can't detain them because residing illegally is not a crime that gets punished with detaining
[16:21:45] <kuudes> sure, government can even shoot people with military, it can go to war
[16:21:46] <feep> as a result, other organs of the government check it and make it predictable. you get division of powers
[16:21:53] <feep> it can turn autocratic, see hitler
[16:21:54] <kuudes> and I am saying I accept war against convoy
[16:22:04] <feep> and I am saying it is imprudent.
[16:22:10] <kuudes> which is what canada did with state of emergency
[16:22:15] * feep shrugs
[16:22:18] <feep> we will see if it works.
[16:22:24] <kuudes> sure, on that I agree
[16:22:57] <feep> the point I am making is just that
[16:23:06] <feep> the shape of the government is not a universal pattern written in the stars
[16:23:13] <feep> it is a body, with organs, that fulfill a purpose
[16:23:17] <kuudes> over here we indeed already have a law that allows the government to make a statute to force vaccination on any group it chooses
[16:23:26] <kuudes> but it does not choose to do so, because.
[16:23:33] <mst> I am not particularly impressed by the convoy muppets but I don't believe the canadian government's invocation of emergency powers was necessarily wise
[16:23:33] <feep> the functions of this body do not generally extend beyond its skin.
[16:23:45] <feep> and outside the skin is not another, bigger body
[16:23:46] <mst> also a fuckload of tow trucks would've been funnier
[16:23:54] <kuudes> mst, thats true
[16:23:55] <feep> it's just ... nothing. the howling void.
[16:24:09] <kuudes> but I am worried that they indeed could actually have enough force that they could oust the state
[16:24:14] <kuudes> and I don't want that
[16:24:18] <mst> feep: of course -your- void howls
[16:24:20] <mst> fucking furries
[16:24:21] <feep> now, sometimes states try to build themselves into bigger bodies
[16:24:23] <feep> mst: :3
[16:24:41] <feep> but state, being an accumulation of force, tend to be resistent to relinquishing it
[16:24:53] <kuudes> and it is ok, often
[16:25:10] <feep> what I am saying is if you are appealing to human rights, you are appealing to an agreement between states, a metabody
[16:25:15] <feep> but it is not a very strong one.
[16:25:29] <kuudes> ...no, not completely
[16:25:31] <mst> right, this was almost certainly not going to end cleanly once the convoy moved from protesting specific policies to challenging the legitimacy of the government itself
[16:25:32] <feep> though it is backed by a strong meme.

[16:25:56] <kuudes> usa plead to meme on its base

[16:26:22] <feep> yes exactly! "please don't kill me with cancer, cells."
[16:26:49] <feep> and then there is a careful balance of not evolving *too* good cancer resistance
[16:26:57] <kuudes> finland pleads to 1400s swedish founding or something

[16:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Probably because America conquered it)
[16:28:09] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: tbf the eu is a metabody that's fairly together
[16:28:18] <kuudes> because ussr decided it was never russia
[16:28:19] <feep> probably because we were at each other's throats in living memory
[16:28:52] <feep> people can say "well what the fuck do we get out of being in this conglomerate"
[16:28:57] <feep> "no war in europe in 70 years"
[16:29:00] <feep> "oh yeah"
[16:29:01] <kuudes> feep, it is more that part of usa armed part of other usa against other usa
[16:29:02] <feep> it's a strong argument
[16:29:11] <kuudes> north -> blacks -> south
[16:29:48] <kuudes> north dominates south because there are blacks that are stronger than south nonblacks as long as north armed them
[16:30:05] <feep> I have no idea what you are talking about.
[16:30:32] <kuudes> so south blacks depend on current north dominate state of facts, and north depends on the blacks being, because otherwise south would be independent on its territory
[16:30:42] <kuudes> and then cultural frosting on top
[16:30:53] <kuudes> they had a civil war there
[16:30:53] <feep> why are we talking about the us civil war
[16:31:05] <kuudes> because we talked about europe's civil war
[16:31:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> The U.S. wasn't founded after or on the basis of the Civil War, so what relevance does that have exactly
[16:31:40] <kuudes> current usa sort of was
[16:31:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also no
[16:31:47] <feep> well
[16:31:51] <kuudes> because a question was asked "you and what army"
[16:31:53] <feep> it is a pretty big part of the memetic makeup
[16:32:08] <kuudes> and north answered "this army"
[16:32:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're like two regimes behind
[16:32:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're thinking of the previous regime, at least
[16:32:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe two back
[16:32:35] <feep> eh, I think there's a heritage in the obsession with white supremacy to the civil war
[16:32:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a heritage of lots of things to lots of things
[16:32:51] <feep> true
[16:33:30] <feep> but like, germany for instance is highly marked by our last two regimes
[16:34:34] <feep> kuudes: I think my point is mostly
[16:35:00] <feep> that if people forget that they are sovereign and the power of the state comes from them rather than the other way around, then they will get reactions like "the state should just take the trucks away"
[16:35:27] <tarquinius> "The liberal (German "freiheitlich"),[1] secularized state lives by prerequisites which it cannot guarantee itself."
[16:35:28] <feep> and what will happen is, in this model, that there is a certain millipercentage of people a year who wake up and realize that human rights are just a frame and they can actually do whatever they want
[16:35:33] <feep> and we tend to call these people terrorists
[16:36:05] <feep> this is why I said the state must ensure that *no* mob, not just the majority, considers that they are being bullied.
[16:36:33] <mst> feep: that or kaoskinder
[16:36:41] <nshepperd2> it seems to make sense to me to think the state should just take the trucks away if the trucks are annoying me and their protest seems stupid
[16:36:45] <feep> I do not know that reference.
[16:37:10] <feep> nshepperd2: it's like ... "if you hate the truck protest, wait till you see the post-truck protests"
[16:37:25] <nshepperd2> much like i would have approved of the police arresting BLM rioters if they had bothered to do so
[16:37:29] <mst> feep: the german anarchists who have an annual smash the shit out of city centres event
[16:37:33] <feep> nshepperd2: okay fair
[16:37:36] <feep> mst: ah right
[16:37:46] <Betawolf> taking the trucks away is one of the least problematic things canada is doing
[16:38:05] <feep> nshepperd2: I think the core question here is the ability of the state to manage that millipercentage, shrink its size, etc, without coalescing more resistance
[16:38:13] <two2thehead> btw, has someone done a financial report on the average trucker?
[16:38:20] <feep> there's an optimum there somewhere
[16:38:31] <two2thehead> Should be interesting to compare and contrast that with the protesting truckers
[16:38:52] <feep> oyeah would be interesting
[16:38:56] <Betawolf> I dunno how people miss this, but refusing someone financial services and the ability to travel effectively destroys their entire life.
[16:38:59] <mst> kuudes: http://trout.me.uk/sherman.jpg
[16:39:00] <Robomot> image/jpeg (720x720; 70 KB)
[16:39:07] <two2thehead> iirc 10% of trucks are actually owned by single operators. The rest are fleet
[16:39:15] <two2thehead> feep, ikr? :D
[16:39:49] <Betawolf> Wanna sue the government about it? Hope you've got a pro bono lawyer because you sure can't pay one.
[16:39:50] <kuudes> I mean, I presume after civil war it would have been problematic for the north if south would have kept an insurgency going
[16:39:58] <kuudes> which is what I see feep pointing toward
[16:40:07] <mst> Betawolf: this is why I think 'tow them, let the truckers pay a small fine to get them back from the tow yard' would've cleaned things up without most of the downsides
[16:40:12] <kuudes> like, if finland will get conquered, there will be insurgency
[16:40:13] <Betawolf> Wanna live on charity? Peoples' assets get frozen for helping you.
[16:40:13] <feep> anyway, my point is, I think that the fact that the democracy operates on majorities obscures the fact that the state needs to satisfice on satisfying 99.9% of its citzens.
[16:40:20] <mst> I could easily be wrong, but the general principle seems about right
[16:40:20] <kuudes> which has the point of keeping the occupiers out
[16:40:25] <Betawolf> mst: yeah
[16:40:41] <mst> inconvenience and a relatively mild economic penalty should winnow out 90%+ of the problem children
[16:40:50] <feep> yeah
[16:40:51] <kuudes> yeah, I suppose expanding the force of parking office would suffice
[16:40:56] <Betawolf> and you don't need emergency powers to do any of that
[16:41:07] <mst> might have to arrest a few of the hardcore ones but minimising arrests is pretty much always a net win
[16:41:07] *** Quits: Obormot\Gaia (~obormot@user/obormot) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:41:27] <kuudes> over here it would go so that the parking office / police would put fines on those trucks, and when they would not get removed, then they would get towed
[16:41:39] *** Joins: Obormot\Gaia (~obormot@user/obormot)
[16:41:55] <kuudes> and if there were too many of them, then the office at charge - the parking office, could ask for assistance from other officials, such as police or the army
[16:42:06] <kuudes> so they could get more manpower
[16:42:28] <kuudes> if there was resistance to the official act of towing, then the office at charge could ask the police to break the resistance to lawful order
[16:42:41] <kuudes> and then the police would do the minimum amount of force to stop the resistance
[16:42:55] <kuudes> but the police has the monopoly on escalating violence
[16:43:29] <kuudes> and the police is controlled post fact by courts on if their use of force was legal or not
[16:43:47] <kuudes> Betawolf, I don't know how it goes in canada
[16:43:51] <feep> and the goal of all of this is to not be an autocracy, because people don't like that.
[16:44:22] <kuudes> I presume in canada the thing that is missing could be indeed the banning of use of vehicles in protests
[16:44:33] <kuudes> feep, mind you that protesting masked is banned in finland
[16:44:46] <feep> I think my point is that you can't outoppress your way out of appearing line an autocracy.
[16:44:50] <feep> like*
[16:45:18] <kuudes> it seems to me you might be missing something from the concept of oppression
[16:46:00] <kuudes> like, it seems to me that for instance deciding on left or right side traffic is not oppression, even though it technically requires escalation to violence
[16:46:11] <feep> well yes!
[16:46:17] <feep> people don't feel oppressed by it!
[16:46:34] <kuudes> ah, you feel the self feeling is the deciding thing?
[16:46:36] <feep> a very large part of that is that it makes sense.
[16:46:40] <kuudes> but that seems rather gameable
[16:46:52] <feep> well, people are pretty good at ratting out sentiment gaming
[16:47:00] <kuudes> so it seems to me that others feelings do not need to be accepted as the ultimate delineator
[16:47:08] <feep> they're not a delineator
[16:47:13] <feep> they're the point.
[16:47:30] <feep> or rather, an 1:1 proxy for the point
[16:47:40] <feep> the actual point is game theory, emotions are just what we evolved for it
[16:47:47] <feep> 1:0.8 sorry
[16:48:17] <kuudes> maybe. this goes out from the centroid of what is to such extent that I am not very reluctant to invoke "I don't have to have an opinion on that"
[16:49:50] <kuudes> re foreign influence: most of the things that arise from social media are in fact astroturfed memes
[16:50:04] <kuudes> many of those come from us bodies, of course
[16:50:12] <kuudes> and then those are not foreign insofar as they affect usa
[16:50:46] <kuudes> but it seems to me that people have maybe too low of a prior for them being astroturfing, and that there is astroturf from also outside usa, namely russia and china
[16:50:48] <feep> Imma go take a shower
[16:51:11] <kuudes> to me this seems more salient, as it seems finland has lower amount of domestic astroturfing
[16:51:13] <nshepperd2> if you just let people do whatever economic damage they want you're basically legalizing anarchotyranny which is just other oppression
[16:51:22] <kuudes> that is a prudent take imo
[16:51:43] <feep> imo that is the state of affairs in fact.
[16:51:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[16:51:48] <kuudes> and protests get their say rather well in finland even without doing damage
[16:51:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> We already have anarcho-tyranny, right now
[16:52:03] <nshepperd2> yeah and it sucks
[16:52:14] <feep> yeah I mean, why do you think we want safe AI lol
[16:52:52] <feep> when you live in a dyson sphere around the sun, assuming that the ai is not oppressive, there's a lot of "out" available.
[16:52:55] <kuudes> I don't feel I live in anarchotyranny
[16:53:03] <feep> that means you live in a healthy state.
[16:53:08] <nshepperd2> blm people running rampant breaking into shops
[16:53:17] <kuudes> yeah, we don't have that
[16:53:25] <kuudes> and if we had, indeed the police would arrest them
[16:53:32] <nshepperd2> basically the entirety of SF
[16:53:40] <mst> nshepperd2: that was kind of a bunch of mostly white dickhead anarchists using the anti-police protests as an excuse
[16:53:59] <mst> american movements seem to be bad at separating out people like that from their mainline
[16:54:06] <kuudes> makes sense
[16:54:19] <mst> or the american culture war is so heavy that media draws battle lines rather than distinctions
[16:54:34] * mst unsure exactly where the pathology lies, probably 'all of the above'
[16:54:37] <kuudes> usa is not a multivalued society, I think
[16:54:54] <kuudes> blue-red, not that much other colors
[16:54:55] <mst> kuudes: you think? dude, don't do that, it's saturday
[16:54:56] * mst runs
[16:55:05] <kuudes> XD
[16:55:55] * mst still waking up with the assistance of a pint of coffee with half a scoop of caramel ice cream in it plus a dash of bourbon, expect a degree of silliness in between the sentences where I actually try and mean something
[16:56:02] <feep> amazing
[16:56:15] <kuudes> but on tangent: latest news/propaganda brought an interesting pov of ukraine - it could be the current place for free slav culture, similar to 90s
[16:56:56] <kuudes> so if they can withstand the current situation, maybe it could indeed become the "out" people from russia could move to
[16:57:10] <kuudes> in case they want to live in their own culture, but with freedom
[16:57:21] <kuudes> and belarus

Links are the same color as non-links but some non-links are a different color for no reason. "Get started" is famously uninformative and leads to dramatically reduced clickthrough rates.

[20:19:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pseudo-elements are of course not real elements, consequently they do not have text nodes, consequently the text within them is not selectable

[22:09:47] <ggreer> I wonder if US power reliability peaked around 2000. I'd also love to see stats broken down by region. it might be a few unreliable regions that are responsible for most of the decline
[22:11:37] <mst> I continue to love that the UK power grid actually has operational planning for a spike in consumption around 5.30pm when my countrymen get home from work and put the kettle on for a cup of tea

[22:16:43] <ggreer> guam had load shedding for 12 hours a day but that's because guam's government is utterly incompetent
[22:17:53] <ggreer> I'm kinda surprised that EVs haven't totally fucked the grid yet. everyone gets home at 5:30PM and plugs in their car that suddenly starts sucking 6 kilowatts (4x typical household consumption)
[22:19:43] <gwern> still too small to matter compared to stuff like heat waves I bet
[22:19:59] <gwern> and with reduction in commuting past 2 years, I bet the effect actually dropped
[22:20:09] <ggreer> hell, a typical supercharger station has maybe 16 bays. at 250kW each, that's a peak draw of 4 megawatts. tesla puts batteries at their charging stations to reduce stress on the grid but it's still an absurd amount of power
