[00:02:46] <pushcx> bad marketing
[00:04:12] <pushcx> But I don't really care much about value statements, I care about the discussion norm of not throwing big insults at some random profession.
[00:06:13] <gerikson> I used to think of them as pretty lame too but they do sometimes provide a framework for discusion

[00:09:03] <technomancy[m]> in theory they can be used to call out bad behavior but in practice when that happens you usually get "ah yes we care a lot about that and will take your comments into consideration but do nothing" when said behavior is profitable

[00:24:17] <JordiGH> I am trying to not drown in cynicism.
[00:24:26] <JordiGH> So maybe, idk, those value statements have value.
[00:24:34] <JordiGH> But I really want to know is why they started happening.
[00:24:35] <constxd> no your cynical instinct is correct
[00:25:06] <constxd> i think it's like
[00:25:28] <constxd> some incident occurs between two employees and it causes a lot of drama
[00:26:06] <constxd> so then you want to minimize the probability of future incidents somehow
[00:26:47] <constxd> come up with some 'code of conduct' and try to instill it in people
[00:27:09] <gwozniak> We have guiding values with an annual survey of employees to judge how they think the company is doing with respect to said values.  There seems to be actual things done to make it better
[00:27:36] <constxd> require employees to do training that ensures they understand the values, etc.
[00:27:57] <constxd> it's all just to minimize friction and maximize productivity
[00:28:22] <technomancy> the values have *some* power; it's just very paltry compared to the power that profit carries
[00:28:32] <constxd> yes
[00:30:09] <constxd> the messaging regarding company values is designed to maximize profits by minimizing internal conflict and giving the company plausible deniability in cases where somebody is in fact harassed or something
[00:30:47] <constxd> the company doesn't actually value those things at all
[00:31:03] <constxd> (necessarily)

I try to really keep in mind that the only thing we see from people is the end result of "effort to do the right thing + things that make us impulsively not do the right thing + caring levels", so judging people too much on the end result can be unfair

[18:26:29] <Teckla> When it processes long strings, it causes a stack overflow exception (in Java).  :(

[21:30:14] <technomancy> lol but jordi it just works
[21:30:16] <JordiGH> lol
[21:32:03] <JordiGH> There's no X selection either.
[21:32:11] <JordiGH> You gotta use a keyboard to copy text around.
[21:32:14] <JordiGH> Like a caveman.

[21:32:21] <JordiGH> Except in the terminal, for some reason.
[21:32:25] <JordiGH> That has X-like selection.
[21:32:51] <JordiGH> I suppose I should be grateful I can have a right-click mouse button now.
[21:33:28] <JordiGH> chenghiz_: I can, but then programs have a peculiar idea of what they think modifier keys should be, even after being remapped. I mean, what they're for.
