[11:12:23] <Ulfnic[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "does anyone knows any minimal..." <- I'd recommend CentOS Streams if you want reliable rolling. AlmaLinux if you want a community owned fork of RHEL but the packages will be a bit old.
[11:15:46] <Ulfnic[m]> Likewise with any other RHEL clone
[11:18:26] <Ulfnic[m]> Personally I use Fedora Everything (CentOS and RHEL come from forks of Fedora)
[11:19:41] <Ulfnic[m]> It's up to date with really good repos and lets you select what software/desktop you want so you can just chose nothing and have a super minimal TTY. I do all my desktops builds from TTY.

[13:29:28] <NeoVoid[m]> in debian based distros we have debian as upstream at the top providing everything to other distros and may be ubuntu second upstream who still uses debian as upstream.
[13:29:28] <NeoVoid[m]> and other little distros are depends on these two. thats why we call them debian based distros. 
[13:29:28] <NeoVoid[m]> but in redhat its actually fedora based distros?

[14:27:08] <relejek[m]> Neo Void:  well. RHEL came first but fedora is community+redhat driven. so, bleeding edge development is done on fedora and then centOS and RHEL pulls what they like from fedora. fedora is not 'boss upstream' but it is just ahead in updates and features. RHEL is the money maker thus the 'boss'
[14:30:29] <relejek[m]> > why people pay for redhat then?
[14:30:30] <relejek[m]> RHEL makes money being a large scale enterprise linux. that money is used to pay RedHat employees to work on RHEL and Fedora.
[14:30:30] <relejek[m]> Fedora is for community & experiments that implies it is bleeding edge and likely unstable for enterprise use.
[14:30:30] <relejek[m]> Enterprises pay for RHEL's stability and services that come with it for business use-cases.

[17:57:30] <smud[m]1> evil bunny ears
[19:09:59] <Ulfnic[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "image.jpeg" <- Volunteer work isn't Communism. Volunteers choose to work for free which make a big difference when it comes to motivation though being paid well tends to be an even better motivator.

[19:13:23] <Ulfnic[m]> They don't control Fedora and Fedora commonly makes decision that are in the best interest of it's community that Red Hat isn't really interested in but they also have a very healthy relationship. I know a lot of Red Hat guys and they just lovely FOSS loving people.
[19:13:33] <Ulfnic[m]> * and they're just
[19:14:16] <Ulfnic[m]> * healthy relationship with them. I, * and they're just
[19:15:23] <Ulfnic[m]> CentOS used to be it's own community run fork of RHEL but Red Hat bought it some time ago and recently turned it into a fork of Fedora instead of RHEL.
[19:16:05] <Ulfnic[m]> They work on this fork using CI/CD until CentOS is forked and becomes the next version of RHEL
[19:17:39] <Ulfnic[m]> CentOS 8 is the last fork of RHEL, CentOS Streams is an intermittent fork of Fedora that'll eventually because each new version of future RHEL.
[19:18:16] <Ulfnic[m]> So tldr....
[19:18:16] <Ulfnic[m]> Fedora (funded by RH) -> CentOS Streams (RH) -> RHEL (RH)

[20:35:37] <NeoVoid[m]> This video also cleared it out nicely.
[20:35:50] <NeoVoid[m]> <MohdAariz[m]> "Librewolf more tbh" <- nyxt
[20:36:51] <NeoVoid[m]> i like how he said it "symbiotic relationship" between centos and fedora
[20:37:31] <NeoVoid[m]> and a love triangle between three

[20:58:52] <Ulfnic[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "https://yewtu.be/watch?v=44tARUc..." <- That video is old, CentOS isn't a fork of RHEL anymore.
[20:58:53] <Ulfnic[m]> CentOS 8 is the last fork of RHEL and support ended last year.
[21:01:13] <Ulfnic[m]> CentOS Streams 8 and 9 are the supported projects and 9+ come from Fedora.
