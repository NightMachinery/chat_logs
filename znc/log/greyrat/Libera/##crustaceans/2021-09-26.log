[00:12:38] <gerikson> > What I do know is that Nim‚Äôs greatest achievement is convincing people that it‚Äôs a compiled Python, and not a 21st-century Pascal dressed up to look like Python.
[00:12:41] <gerikson> nice one
[00:14:23] <Brekkjern> You saying I should learn Nim? :P
[00:16:37] <companion_cube> an actual compiled python would be kind of interesting though
[00:21:55] <companion_cube> (I say that but a lot of things would be improved by diverging from python, so‚Ä¶)
[00:23:58] <Brekkjern> What things?
[00:24:43] <Brekkjern> I wouldn't mind a statically typed Python with similar syntax. I think the type hinting syntax works rather nicely
[00:24:53] <Brekkjern> It's all the brackets and all that shit that's really annoying
[00:25:57] <companion_cube> well, it'd have to be expression oriented (like nim I think), with non broken scoping, for a start
[00:26:04] <companion_cube> (nim has `let` iirc)
[00:27:35] <gerikson> ``Bandwidth is experiencing a major outage''
[00:27:47] <gerikson> apparently it's a company of some kind
[00:28:29] <gerikson> ``Bandwidth is the global cloud platform enterprises choose for cloud-ready voice, messaging, and emergency services.''
[00:28:36] <gerikson> jfc
[00:29:25] <Brekkjern> companion_cube: What's broken with the scoping? I've never really noticed anything different from other languages?
[00:30:17] <companion_cube> lol, python's scoping is the worst
[00:30:25] <companion_cube> first thing is the existence of `local` and `global`
[00:30:40] <Brekkjern> I never use them, so...
[00:30:47] <companion_cube> not having a `var`/`let`/‚Ä¶ is just bad as it forces such problems
[00:30:52] <companion_cube> secondly, captures are all over the place
[00:31:13] <companion_cube> >>> l = [lambda:i for i in range(10)]
[00:31:15] <companion_cube> >>> [f() for f in l]
[00:31:17] <companion_cube> [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
[00:31:18] <companion_cube> like‚Ä¶ üò±
[00:31:33] <companion_cube> and of course, loop indices escape the loop
[00:31:44] <manicennui> I can't stand Python.
[00:31:56] <manicennui> It's like the least appealing of the popular dynamic languages.
[00:32:16] <manicennui> It feels like its design is completely random.
[00:32:50] <manicennui> And things like the __foo__ methods feel like you are messing with the internals when you override them.
[00:34:47] <dimadima> is "fixed üò±" a bad commit message?
[00:35:57] <Brekkjern> Well, you kinda are when you dick about with dunder methods
[00:37:58] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Nah, they're all just methods.
[00:38:11] <Brekkjern> I know they are
[00:38:21] <Brekkjern> I'm saying you are mucking about with internals...
[00:38:28] <manicennui> And __init__ is hardly some kind of internals.
[00:38:37] <Brekkjern> I mean... Fuck around with __hash__ and you might have some bad times
[00:38:53] <dimadima> i'm guessing the design of python syntax was largely a reaction to the langues popular in the early 90s
[00:38:58] <manicennui> __hash__ is not internals either.
[00:39:23] <manicennui> dimadima: I think it's more just that Guido is a bad designer.
[00:39:34] <manicennui> But language syntax design obviously doesn't matter.
[00:41:33] <dimadima> i don't like python, but lua feels more random and cobbled together to me
[00:49:20] <goodger> python seems pretty random and cobbled together to me
[00:49:54] <goodger> also, lua is barely two years newer than python
[00:51:17] <mouseghost> python built-in methods are illogical kinda
[00:52:02] <manicennui> Obviously Perl has the optimal syntax.
[00:52:23] <Brekkjern> You spelled Scheme wrong
[00:52:36] <manicennui> I was joking.
[00:52:41] <Brekkjern> So was I
[00:52:48] <manicennui> If I wrote Scheme I wouldn't be joking.
[00:53:18] <manicennui> I much rather write Perl than Python though.
[00:54:01] <manicennui> Python seems pretty indicative of professional software development in general: extremely mediocre to bad but extremely popular.
[00:55:04] <dimadima> i would love to learn perl
[00:55:13] <dimadima> the passion people have for perl i think says it all
[00:55:25] <dimadima> what's a more beloved language than perl
[00:55:36] <mouseghost> dont forget haskell
[00:55:42] <dimadima> okay that's a contender
[00:56:24] <gerikson> > Social media is for posting cat pictures, wedding invitations and ancient jokes you heard for the first time yesterday. RSS is for creating curated periodic content streams.
[00:56:36] <manicennui> dimadima: Common Lisp? Haskell?
[00:56:48] <mouseghost> also Ada
[00:56:48] <gerikson> Common Lisp seems hated tho
[00:56:54] <mouseghost> gerikson, how so?
[00:57:04] <mouseghost> ive only heard praise about its awesome repl abilities?
[00:57:06] <manicennui> gerikson: By the people who choose to use it?
[00:57:26] <gerikson> plenty of Lispers thinks it's huge and bloated
[00:57:32] <goodger> oh
[00:57:34] <mouseghost> also sly has cat ascii art on the startup screen
[00:57:36] <goodger> happy birthday gerikson
[00:58:05] <Brekkjern> Being blunt, does it really matter what you people's opionions are of Python? I mean... You aren't writing it as far as I remember, so you are really only observing it from the outside?
[00:58:24] <goodger> nobody's opinion on anything matters
[00:58:27] <Brekkjern> True
[00:59:05] <Brekkjern> But like, rating languages that were designed for wildly different purposes on their ability to produce massive enterprise software...
[01:01:34] <mouseghost> first impression is also valuable, imo
[01:07:09] <Brekkjern> Sure, but my point was that as long as the language is made for one type of user, does it matter that another type of user doesn't like it?
[01:07:33] <gerikson> thanks goodger!
[01:09:00] <Brekkjern> Wait? Your birthday today, gerikson? Congrats :)
[01:09:11] <mouseghost> happy birthday then, gerikson :P
[01:09:27] <mouseghost> Brekkjern, it doesnt technically matter, true...
[01:09:30] <goodger> and I remembered with 23 minutes to spare
[01:12:08] <manicennui> Brekkjern: It's not as though Python was designed for its main use case today.
[01:13:01] <Brekkjern> No, but it has evolved to that purpose
[01:13:21] <manicennui> The only reason why it is even good at that use case is because of some well-maintained C++ libraries.
[01:14:02] <Brekkjern> So?
[01:14:04] <gerikson> thanks guys!

[04:13:09] <dimadima> thanks for the recommendations
[04:17:38] <manicennui> Hmm. Netflix is going to release a weekly anime.
[04:17:46] <manicennui> Do they have other shows that are released weekly?

[04:18:05] <buttsbot> Blue Period | Official Trailer | Netflix Anime - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV0-SYn3YuM
[04:18:17] <manicennui> Really love the range of subject matter covered in anime.
[04:18:30] <manicennui> Also, the crying.
[04:18:39] <manicennui> We could use more crying in software development.

[04:19:46] <buttsbot> Netflix To Release Episodes Of Their Original Shows Weekly - Small Screen
[04:20:06] <dimadima>  manicennui> We could use more crying in software development.
[04:20:07] <dimadima> lol
[04:20:25] * manicennui examines some beautiful code with dimadima and has an emotional moment.
[04:20:32] <dimadima> i'm going to respectfully disagree
[04:20:39] <dimadima> oh, like that
[04:20:51] <dimadima> yeah we can tear up over some beautful code
[04:21:12] <manicennui> Just non-stop emotional outpouring.
[04:21:25] <manicennui> Stand ups become a real bonding experience.
[04:22:31] <dimadima> how about... fishing?
[04:22:38] <dimadima> for bonding
[04:22:42] <dimadima> without crying
[04:22:53] <manicennui> Please don't oppress me.
[04:22:53] <dimadima> fish don't have feelings
[04:23:22] <dimadima> could catch some lake trout and have a fish fry
[04:23:46] <klardotsh> something in the way...... mmmmmmmmmm- mmmmmmmm.... something in the way, yeah... mmmmmmm- mmmmmm
[04:23:54] <dimadima> klardotsh: you got it!
[04:24:42] <manicennui> Yes, programming also needs a bombastic music.
[04:25:09] <manicennui> Like you fix a production problem and release, super excited emotional music!
[04:26:06] <manicennui> Speaking of anime, and furries, I finished Beastars.
[04:26:25] <manicennui> I like the characters, and the animation, and several aspects of the show, but the plot is kind of... meh?
[04:26:38] <dimadima> god, i love silence
[04:26:46] <manicennui> =(
[04:27:55] <dimadima> why the sad face
[04:31:55] <dimadima> ‚ÄúAll of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.‚Äù
[04:32:09] <dimadima> have always wondered if that's a real quote
[04:32:17] <skyl4rk> enjoy the silence?
[04:33:04] <dimadima> definitely when trying to think
[04:33:34] <dimadima> you?
[04:34:40] <skyl4rk> https://ytprivate.com/watch?v=aGSKrC7dGcY
[04:34:41] <buttsbot> Depeche Mode - Enjoy The Silence (Official Video) - YTPrivate
[04:34:47] <skyl4rk> :p
[04:34:54] <dimadima> mmm depeche mode
[04:34:56] <skyl4rk> depends what kind of thinking I guess
[04:36:07] * dimadima listens 
[04:36:31] <manicennui> dimadima: Not sure about the quote, but it is a common sentiment.
[04:36:32] <dimadima> üé∂ words are very, unnecessary üé∂
[04:36:41] <manicennui> I'm pretty good about being alone.
[04:37:18] <manicennui> If I'm in a beautiful natural setting, I can do without any entertainment or distractions.
[04:38:53] <bkero> you must be old
[04:39:03] <bkero> (source: i am old)
[04:40:36] <manicennui> I am.
[04:40:46] <manicennui> But I've always been pretty good about being alone.
[04:41:08] <manicennui> When I was younger I thought that I should try to be like everyone else though.
[04:42:19] <manicennui> I find it pretty easy to be alone even when among a large number of people in Chicago.
[04:42:23] <manicennui> People mind their own business.
[04:45:37] <manicennui> I wonder how I'd do in those isolation tests.
[04:45:47] <manicennui> As long as I had books or something, I think I could last a long time.
[04:46:55] <bkero> get a cabin at a lake
[04:46:59] <bkero> no internet access
[04:47:03] <bkero> no neighbors
[04:54:37] <manicennui> I've thought about moving to the mountains.
[04:54:58] <bkero> Hah
[04:55:05] <bkero> Okay Spider Robinson
[04:55:14] <manicennui> Not like off the grid or anything.
[04:55:17] <bkero> Oh sorry. Spider Jerusalem.
[04:55:23] <manicennui> Like outside of Asheville.
[04:56:00] <bkero> Oh sorry. Spider Swampass.
[05:01:04] * manicennui reads about the plot of Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid.
[05:01:48] <manicennui> "Subsequently, Kobayashi had removed a holy sword from Tohru's back, earning her gratitude. With Tohru having no place to stay, Kobayashi offers to let the dragon stay at her home and become her personal maid, to which she agrees."
[05:03:16] <bkero> heh that old gem
[05:03:24] <bkero> immortalized in AMV Hell
[05:04:50] <manicennui> I learned about it because Crunchyroll tweeted this: https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/1441930771267088387?s=20

[05:05:08] <manicennui> You know you want to do it.
[05:05:17] <manicennui> I got Fafnir.
[05:06:52] <bkero> Midgardsomr will do.
[05:27:47] <dimadima> that depeche mode really hit the spot. haven't heard that song in a long time
[05:28:51] <manicennui> Really great song.
[05:28:54] <dimadima> manicennui: you guys are being nice and charitable in #lobsters but maybe suggest a rewrite in rust
[05:29:14] <manicennui> I know I'll get a thousand claims to the contrary, but I think that pop music was absolutely better before the 90s.
[05:29:23] <manicennui> And not just a little bit.
[05:29:37] <dimadima> manicennui: those claims will not be coming from me
[05:29:55] <dimadima> claims to the contrary, i mean
[05:30:21] <manicennui> I try to get pop artists today a chance, but I just don't get it.
[05:30:32] <manicennui> And I don't know whether people are listening to them to be ironic or they just have horrible taste.
[05:30:33] <dimadima> i don't get it _at all_
[05:30:45] <dimadima> i don't know
[05:31:00] <manicennui> As soon as I hear the autotuned voice I cringe.
[05:31:05] <dimadima> it drives me crazy because it makes me feel like the old man yelling at clouds but i can't stand any of it
[05:31:10] <dimadima> i mean every so often there's a rap song i like
[05:31:25] <manicennui> There is some indie pop that is good.
[05:31:30] <manicennui> But mainstream hits are just really bad.
[05:31:40] <dimadima> something happened around 2009-2010 with the autotune and T-Payne
[05:31:43] <dimadima> everythin went to shit
[05:31:59] <manicennui> I realize there was bad shit in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but the biggest pop star in the 80s was Michael fucking Jackson.
[05:32:03] <manicennui> And he was the shit.
[05:32:10] <manicennui> Regardless of his extra curricular activities.
[05:32:26] <dimadima> i never go into michael jackson! sory to say
[05:32:38] <dimadima> quincey jones
[05:32:46] <manicennui> I assume you have heard Beat It, Thriller, etc. though.
[05:32:51] <dimadima> yeah for sure
[05:33:06] <dimadima> never struck a chord with me
[05:33:09] <manicennui> My mother was into Whitney Houston, and she was *way* better than most of the female vocalists today.
[05:33:20] <dimadima> well jesus whitney fucking houston
[05:33:25] <dimadima> was a siren
[05:33:38] <manicennui> And Madonna at her peak.
[05:33:40] <manicennui> Great songs.
[05:33:49] <dimadima> yeah madonna at her peak was amazing
[05:33:56] <manicennui> And that's the most mainstream stuff I can think of.
[05:34:10] <manicennui> Let alone bands like Depeche Mode that were not everyone's cup of tea.
[05:34:33] <skyl4rk> maybe today artists doing it for the art can get an audience without having to get involved in the pop machine and so risk losing something of themselves
[05:34:46] <dimadima> i'm waiting for the moment i'll understand what's going on today, but i don't think i will. but i try to keep an open mind
[05:35:13] <dimadima> yeah maybe skyl4rk
[05:35:52] <manicennui> I do think it basically boils down to all forms of art being far more commercial today.
[05:36:09] <manicennui> Same thing with movies.
[05:36:19] <manicennui> I can't stand most of the MCU.
[05:36:39] <manicennui> When I hear people talk about how great the fight scenes are I have to wonder whether they've ever seen an action movie before.
[05:37:29] <manicennui> I hate shitting on the fight scenes in particular because I know the stunt people are super talented.
[05:37:47] <manicennui> But they are nothing special, and generally bad.
[05:38:20] <dimadima> i know some really smart people who watch these shitty movies and listen to this shitty music
[05:38:34] <manicennui> Fortunately there is so much content made today that enough good stuff gets made.
[05:38:42] <dimadima> yeah
[05:38:52] <dimadima> i think basically skyl4rk was on to something
[05:38:57] <dimadima> it's a different economy
[05:39:02] <manicennui> I just want to find a community of people who focuses on it.
[05:39:02] <manicennui> Who aren't pretentious about it.
[05:39:45] <manicennui> BTW, Kate on Netflix is far better than Gunpowder Milkshake.
[05:39:48] <manicennui> But still not amazing.
[05:39:53] <manicennui> I enjoyed it enough though.
[05:40:01] <manicennui> Gunpowder Milkshake was really bad.
[05:40:25] <manicennui> Michelle Yeoh was the only one who looked like she could fight, probably because she can.
[05:41:04] <skyl4rk> I also agree with the thought that maybe art might be more commercial today, which would make the decision to stay away even easier for those that want to remain in control.
[05:42:11] <skyl4rk> anyway, off to bed
[05:42:13] <skyl4rk> o/
[05:44:28] <manicennui> I stopped following music a decade ago. I end up listening to the same artists over and over again, but there are a lot of them.
[05:44:53] <manicennui> I've also noticed that there are few bands that are able to release multiple great albums.
[05:45:34] <manicennui> The couple that I can think of off the top of my head are Zeppelin and Radiohead.
[05:46:04] <manicennui> Metallica too, but after the black album they go way downhill.
[05:54:14] <dimadima> well #lobsters has devolved
[06:01:08] <dimadima> i don't want to watch but i can't look away
[06:08:56] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/ehpsv69w8qp71.jpg
[06:09:40] <dimadima> manicennui: your cat
[06:09:42] <dimadima> ?
[06:09:52] <manicennui> Nope.
[06:10:11] <dimadima> just posting?
[06:10:22] <dimadima> a metaphor?
[06:14:15] <manicennui> Just something from reddit I liked.
[06:14:24] <manicennui> But it seems to fit with your last comment too.
[06:15:43] <dimadima> yes thanks

[07:09:12] <manicennui> I have a friend who would kid with his wife like that.
[07:09:34] <manicennui> For example, he would say, "Hon, know what I was thinking?"
[07:09:43] <manicennui> And she'd respond with, "Divorce?"
[07:09:49] <dimadima> heh
[07:09:56] <dimadima> are they still married?
[07:10:36] <dimadima> ;)
[07:12:23] *** Joins: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz)
[07:18:03] <manicennui> Yes.
[07:18:12] <manicennui> They were completely joking.
[07:18:21] <manicennui> They are one of those couples who seem to be truly happy together.
[07:23:17] <dimadima> i was just kidding
[07:23:20] <dimadima> that is good though
[07:26:19] <manicennui> I think one of my aunts and uncles were like that until they had kids.
[07:27:48] <dimadima> a good friend of mine
[07:27:56] <dimadima> was having marriage problems
[07:27:59] <dimadima> and he was like
[07:28:10] <dimadima> "we're having another kid, we think it might help our marriage"
[07:28:19] <manicennui> hah
[07:31:22] <dimadima> needless to say, they are divorced
[07:32:08] <manicennui> I don't know whether I know of any people who seem truly happy with young children.
[07:40:52] <dimadima> it seems to put a lot of strain and many relationships
[07:43:08] <dimadima> it would be nice if people didn't have kids unless they wanted them
[07:43:27] <dimadima> and there's no way to know how a person will react to having a child
[07:43:31] <dimadima> or what that child will be
[07:49:17] <dimadima> i admire the people who really know they don't want kids
[07:49:24] <dimadima> and refuse to have them
[07:52:38] <manicennui> Probably far easier to raise them in a tribe-like setting.
[07:52:52] <manicennui> Modern life is already challenging enough with adding kids to the mix.
[07:53:26] <dimadima> yeah definitely
[07:58:44] <manicennui> s/with/without/
[08:04:31] <manicennui> I have a friend who just had a kid. Fortunately his wife wasn't working before, and he is a software engineer who makes good money.
[08:04:43] <manicennui> All I've noticed so far is that he gets less sleep.
[08:04:54] <manicennui> He did quit smoking before his kid was born though.
[08:05:21] <dimadima> heh my brain made that correction automagically
[08:05:33] <dimadima> yeah money and a dedicated parent makes a huge difference
[08:05:55] <dimadima> but there's no gaurantee the dedicated parent is up for it. and even full-time parent it's still really hard
[08:05:58] <dimadima> yeah no sleep it's insane
[08:06:19] <dimadima> he village thing is probably spot on
[08:06:32] <dimadima> two people is not really enoguh
[08:07:57] <manicennui> He wants to move to Michigan to be closer to her parents, and I can't blame him.
[08:10:24] <dimadima> michigan is nice, too
[08:10:43] <dimadima> it's no chicago, though
[08:11:21] <manicennui> He's in the suburbs now, so I don't think it will be worse.
[08:11:29] <manicennui> Other than their winters, I think it will be better.
[08:11:36] <dimadima> oh well yeah
[08:11:47] <dimadima> chicago winters are no joke though
[08:11:54] <dimadima> i can't imagine michigan is /that/ much worse
[08:12:01] <manicennui> And he is into guns, so MI is somewhat better for that.
[08:12:08] <manicennui> The UP is.
[08:12:15] <dimadima> yeah  i was going to say the UP
[08:12:15] <manicennui> I think the rest of the state is only slightly worse.
[08:12:18] <dimadima> guns, man
[08:12:24] <dimadima> being into guns is beyond me
[08:12:32] <dimadima> my father in law is in to guns and i shot some with him
[08:12:41] <dimadima> primitive ass things
[08:12:56] <dimadima> controlled mini explosives
[08:13:11] <dimadima> 0 desire to shoot again
[08:13:22] <dimadima> loud and insane
[08:15:16] <dimadima> is gun ownership that much worse in suburban chicago than MI?
[08:16:38] <manicennui> I think they are mechanically interesting.
[08:16:49] <manicennui> And it is possible to completely understand everything about them.
[08:17:03] <manicennui> I wouldn't mind target shooting.
[08:17:17] <manicennui> IL is always trying to add new gun laws.
[08:17:29] <dimadima> yeah by primitive i didn't mean mechanically they're not interesting
[08:17:33] <dimadima> they're definitely cool
[08:17:41] <manicennui> Gun rights have actually gotten better recently here though.
[08:18:03] <dimadima> i mean they seemed somehow pathologically crazy
[08:18:05] <manicennui> There also aren't a lot of ranges around Chicago.
[08:18:19] <dimadima> i'm not against guns per se, they're just not for me
[08:18:41] <dimadima> i was surprised you can just buy ammunition in illinois
[08:18:52] <manicennui> The problem is American culture, and the fact that Americans are quick to see violence as the answer to problems.
[08:18:55] <dimadima> need a special permit IIRC
[08:18:55] <manicennui> And then give them guns...
[08:19:22] <dimadima> americans watch tons and tons of banal violence and have trouble separating that from real life
[08:19:43] <dimadima> https://time.com/4146086/woman-who-shot-at-home-depot-shoplifters-i-will-never-help-anybody-again/
[08:19:43] <manicennui> I don't know.
[08:19:44] <buttsbot> Woman Who Shot at Home Depot Shoplifters Sentenced to 18 mos | Time
[08:19:57] <manicennui> Chinese people don't go around getting into kung fu fights.
[08:20:06] <manicennui> I don't buy the entertainment explanation.
[08:20:13] <dimadima> i think they stab a lot
[08:20:14] <manicennui> I think violence is fundamental to the US.
[08:20:17] <manicennui> From our very start.
[08:20:17] <dimadima> but i see your point
[08:20:42] <manicennui> And people like to repeat violent lines from the Founding Fathers.
[08:21:02] <manicennui> Then we had slavery for a long time.
[08:21:14] <manicennui> And the Wild West is glorified.
[08:22:41] <dimadima> i don't know
[08:22:54] <dimadima> there's something categorically off abotu pulling a gun outside a home depot on shoplifters in 2021
[08:23:02] <dimadima> or whatever recent year that happened
[08:23:02] <manicennui> We spent decades slaughtering the natives too.
[08:23:24] <dimadima> i don't think that has much of a relationship to found fathers, wild west or native americans
[08:23:34] <manicennui> Not directly.
[08:23:48] <manicennui> But we have no real shared culture outside of our violent past and consumerism.
[08:23:50] <dimadima> and a big connection to people deriving their identities from TV stories and politics
[08:23:56] <dimadima> contemporary "politics"
[08:24:02] <dimadima> aka identity politics
[08:25:09] <manicennui> Oh, and extreme individualism.
[08:26:26] <manicennui> Plus we didn't handle the post Civil War period well at all.
[08:26:43] <manicennui> Lincoln was mostly concerned with trying to unite people, so people weren't punished.
[08:28:14] <dimadima> that's right but how does that relate to senseless gun violence
[08:29:34] <manicennui> It has to do with the things that fuel our violent culture.
[08:29:41] <manicennui> The guns are just a convenient way to express it.
[08:30:19] <dimadima> sorry that's what i mean
[08:30:24] <dimadima> meant*
[08:30:46] <dimadima> how did the poor handling of post-civil war fuel our violent culture
[08:31:21] <manicennui> There were no real consequences for the Confederates.
[08:32:08] <dimadima> oh in my mind the civil war isn't in the category of violent day to day culture
[08:32:13] <dimadima> that was an organized war thing
[08:32:28] <dimadima> relatively peaceful cultures may engage in warfare just the same
[08:32:40] <manicennui> They were fighting to continue a culture of violence against black people.
[08:33:05] <manicennui> And attempted to violently succeed.
[08:33:17] <dimadima> ah i see
[08:33:22] <manicennui> secede
[08:33:36] <dimadima> succeed and secede
[08:33:36] <manicennui> A few of the leaders were given a slap on the wrist.
[08:33:58] <manicennui> And idiots in the South continue to pretend they are still Confederates to this day.
[08:34:09] <manicennui> Consider what Germany did after WWII.
[08:34:16] <manicennui> People aren't flying Nazi flags.
[08:34:48] <manicennui> Praising the Nazis can be illegal and is definitely not well tolerated.
[08:34:55] <dimadima> yah i don't understand how those momuments were up there until this year in some cases
[08:35:07] <dimadima> it's not just illegal it's unconstitutional in germany
[08:35:18] <dimadima> which is a neat little addition in my mind
[08:35:27] <manicennui> Most of them were built after the war by assholes trying to make the lives of black people worse.
[08:35:37] <dimadima> i can't imagine being black and seeing robert e lee all the time on a horse
[08:35:47] <dimadima> well after the war
[08:35:50] <dimadima> 20s, 30s
[08:35:52] <dimadima> sometimes later
[08:36:13] <manicennui> They would build them at courthouses and such as a not so gentle reminder that they still hate black people.
[08:36:23] <dimadima> sure
[08:36:40] <dimadima> "states rights"
[08:36:46] <manicennui> I don't think the cultural problems are any one thing.
[08:37:04] <manicennui> It's a series of shitty things Americans have done to keep hatred and violent attitudes alive.
[08:37:17] <dimadima> yeah i guess you could argue against my entertainment thesis by saying "well why is all the entertainment violent in the first placE?"
[08:37:33] <manicennui> And there has never been anything like a large scale group movement to try to treat each other well.
[08:37:42] <dimadima> the hippies
[08:37:48] <manicennui> They also watch that violent entertainment in other countries.
[08:37:55] <manicennui> American movies tend to be in the top 10 all over.
[08:38:03] <dimadima> also certain religious movements i'm sure
[08:38:11] <dimadima> but the hippies were a huge movement
[08:38:15] <dimadima> as i understand it
[08:38:48] <dimadima> ppl say the hippies failed but the 70s were an extremely progressive decade
[08:39:01] <manicennui> They were dismissed by most because most of them sat around doing drugs.
[08:39:12] <manicennui> And they also led to the start of the War on Drugs.
[08:39:21] <dimadima> i watched all of matlock season by season with my wife and it was really interesting to see how the reactionary 80s change the show as it went along
[08:39:23] <manicennui> A new violent aspect of our culture
[08:39:34] <manicennui> Not to mention the fact that cops in the US have always been excessively violent.
[08:39:38] <dimadima> i was just saying there was such a movement
[08:39:41] <dimadima> drugs or not
[08:40:09] <dimadima> and it was masive
[08:40:15] <dimadima> and it was a reaction to war, in large part
[08:40:16] <manicennui> I don't think hippies were part of the zeitgeist though. Opposing them was.
[08:40:24] <dimadima> maybe, i wasn't there
[08:40:36] <manicennui> Our foreign policy also plays a big part in our culture of violence.
[08:40:44] <dimadima> the zeitgeist at th etime was controlled by mainstream media
[08:40:58] <dimadima> and mainstream media was The Man
[08:40:58] <dimadima> so
[08:41:25] <dimadima> this book is really good on that subject: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Teat
[08:41:25] <buttsbot> The Glass Teat - Wikipedia

[08:42:54] <manicennui> heh
[08:43:10] <manicennui> I avoided it because most mass produced lagers are pretty bad.
[08:43:14] <dimadima> they didn't win that awary in 1910 or something for nothing
[08:43:38] <manicennui> heh
[08:43:43] <manicennui> I don't think so.
[08:43:50] <manicennui> Wasn't prohibition still in effect?
[08:44:08] <dimadima> i don't think it started yet
[08:44:10] <dimadima> but i made the year up
[08:44:33] <manicennui> "Originally called Best Select, and then Pabst Select, the current name comes from the blue ribbons tied around the bottle neck between 1882 and 1916."
[08:44:49] <manicennui> Ah, Prohibition started in 1920.
[08:44:51] <dimadima> hehe there we go
[08:44:55] <dimadima> thanks
[08:45:02] <dimadima> i haven't seen a can of PBR in a while
[08:45:04] <manicennui> I don't think I trust beer ratings from the early 20th century.
[08:45:49] <manicennui> People in Chicago still have a hard on for Schlitz.
[08:46:58] <dimadima> there's a supermarket on the Upper West Side in NY that has this

[08:48:59] <manicennui> We have liquor stores that are basically warehouses.
[08:50:11] <dimadima> binnys
[08:50:15] <dimadima> i miss binnys
[08:50:41] <manicennui> Yeah.
[08:50:51] <manicennui> A lot of convenient stores have great selections though.
[08:50:57] <manicennui> I haven't been to Binny's in forever.
[08:51:04] <manicennui> And there are tons of dedicated beer stores.

[08:51:40] <manicennui> They have a tap room and pre-pandemic they had multiple tastings per week.
[08:52:12] <dimadima> there are nice semi-wholesale places in around new york city that cater to delis
[08:52:19] <dimadima> they let regular ppl in though too
[08:52:20] <manicennui> But there is a smaller liquor store focused on beer less than a block from me.
[08:52:28] <manicennui> And many restaurants deliver craft beer.
[08:52:49] <dimadima> here on the east coast we have blue laws and all kinds of restrictions. IL is the land of the free
[08:53:41] <manicennui> Yeah, there isn't much I can't get here.
[08:53:52] <manicennui> Basically just some smaller breweries that don't distribute widely.
[08:55:06] <manicennui> Russian River in California and Hill Farmstead in Vermont are the two I'd like to have access to.
[08:55:20] <manicennui> I could trade for them if I really wanted to I guess.
[08:55:34] <manicennui> Since we have better access to Bourbon County Stout.
[08:56:04] <dimadima> i drink like 5 times a year and when i do i try to get wasted
[08:56:12] <dimadima> no elegence there
[08:56:18] <bkero> Oh Russian River.
[08:56:19] <dimadima> just filly me up lol
[08:56:22] <manicennui> I drink a couple times per month or so.
[08:56:26] <bkero> They ship Pliny country-wide now.
[08:56:32] <manicennui> bkero: Oh?
[08:56:34] <bkero> Indeed
[08:57:13] <manicennui> Doesn't look like Binny
[08:57:15] <manicennui> 's has it.
[08:57:23] <manicennui> Which generally means it isn't available here.
[08:57:40] <bkero> Ah, shipping to CA it looks like. https://www.shop.russianriverbrewing.com/collections/most-popular/products/pliny-the-elder-12-pk-510-ml-bottles-shipping-in-ca-only

[08:59:10] <manicennui> dimadima: Did you ever go to FOBAB or Dark Lord Day when you were here?
[08:59:46] <dimadima> nope no recollection of those places
[08:59:49] <manicennui> Both are great events to get super drunk at.
[08:59:52] <dimadima> are those bars?
[09:00:03] <manicennui> FOBAB is festival of barrel aged beers.
[09:00:09] <dimadima> on wow
[09:00:16] <manicennui> Dark Lord Day is a festival when 3 Floyds releases Dark Lord.
[09:00:27] <manicennui> Which is a strong stout.
[09:00:35] <dimadima> i mostly went to dive bars to be honest. and a regular place for me was monk's on lake
[09:00:41] <manicennui> Ah.
[09:00:56] <dimadima> i knew like metal/rock ppl
[09:01:05] <dimadima> 3 floyds is great
[09:01:18] <dimadima> don't get me wrong, i like a good beer
[09:02:11] <dimadima> but it's hard to consume them in quantity
[09:02:19] <manicennui> That's why you drink the strong ones.
[09:02:21] <dimadima> i like wine the most though
[09:02:27] <bkero> manicennui: you have Bells and Three Floyds around there. Those stand up to Pliny.
[09:02:30] <manicennui> Half the beers at FOBAB are over 10%.
[09:02:44] <manicennui> bkero: I want the sours from Russian River.
[09:02:51] <dimadima> mmm i love sours
[09:03:09] <manicennui> Not the IPAS.
[09:03:15] <manicennui> I think everyone has plenty of IPAs these days.
[09:03:18] <bkero> manicennui: Ahh.
[09:03:25] <manicennui> Too many really.
[09:03:30] <bkero> Have you tried La Folie? It's New Belgium, which should distribute over there.
[09:03:37] <manicennui> Yes.
[09:03:54] <manicennui> I've had several of the New Belgium and Avery sours.
[09:03:55] <bkero> Good :)
[09:04:10] <manicennui> Goose Island also has a series of sours with female names.
[09:04:57] <bkero> If you can get any De Garde, Ale Apothecary, Cascade Barrel House, or Logsdon over there, I'd heartily recommend.
[09:05:26] <bkero> I am aging a magnum of De Garde Violet for the specialist of occasions.
[09:05:54] <manicennui> Indiana also has a good sour brewery named Upland.
[09:05:56] <bkero> specialest*
[09:06:23] <bkero> Nice
[09:07:09] <bkero> I live in Portland. It is common here to get a beer with a meal. Pilsner, IPA, or maybe a stout if you ordered some heartier fare. Sour if you'll be drinking it before or after.
[09:07:58] <manicennui> We do plenty of drinking here.
[09:08:11] <manicennui> Portland is a bit too focused on IPAs, but there is a good sour brewery.
[09:08:23] <manicennui> That place that is in the basement of like an office building.
[09:08:41] <manicennui> Upright
[09:09:10] <manicennui> I liked Portland a lot.
[09:09:21] <manicennui> It is probably where I'd move if I thought the West Coast wasn't completely fucked.
[09:10:07] <bkero> We do grow the hops around here. It makes sense we'd want to focus on them. :)
[09:10:24] <manicennui> I just think a lot of craft beer lacks nuance.
[09:10:27] <bkero> Upright is one that does not focus on IPAs. They didn't even brew one until the pandemic basically forced them.
[09:10:36] <manicennui> A hoppy IPA! A hoppy brown ale! A hoppy stout!
[09:10:55] <bkero> 'eh, there's good hoppy and there's bland hoppy
[09:11:07] <manicennui> And there are *so* many IPAs.
[09:11:25] <manicennui> There is basically no reason to drink an IPA from elsewhere at this point.
[09:11:32] <bkero> Some breweries specialize in them. I happen to quite like Breakside's dedication to the west coast style.
[09:11:50] <bkero> Which is made much more rare now that New England milkshakes are the popular style.
[09:12:38] <bkero> Different hops can have very different aroma, bittering, and taste qualities. https://beermaverick.com/hops/hop-comparison-tool/?hops=sabro,hbc472,el-dorado
[09:12:40] <buttsbot> Hop Comparison Tool & Chart - Beer Maverick
[09:12:46] <dimadima> IPAs really jumped the shark
[09:12:47] <manicennui> Half Acre Daisy Cutter is my go to if I want an IPA.
[09:12:52] <manicennui> Sure.
[09:13:02] <manicennui> I just never liked IPAs *that* much to begin with.
[09:13:17] <bkero> I quite like Nelson, Sorachi Ace, Motueka, Mt Hood, and Centennial. I quite dislike Mosaic and Citra.
[09:13:29] <bkero> Ah, then I imagine that distinction doesn't mean much.
[09:13:45] <manicennui> I can appreciate the different flavors and aromas that are possible.
[09:13:54] <manicennui> But I rarely actually want an IPA.
[09:14:02] <manicennui> Especially now that I drink infrequently.
[09:14:15] <bkero> I find that an IPA pairs well with richer food, especially if it's lacking an acidic component.
[09:15:09] <bkero> I can't see many others beers not being overpowered by something like fried chicken
[09:16:17] <bkero> I'm currently lagering a Marzen oktoberfest. It'll be a bit late, but the 6 week mark is Oct 15th. I'll need to have a fest around it.
[09:16:34] <manicennui> I didn't attend our Oktoberfests this year.
[09:16:39] <manicennui> Haven't for a while really.
[09:16:48] <bkero> I'll probably make some lauge pretzels this year.
[09:16:48] <dimadima> bkero: you brew?
[09:16:50] <manicennui> But one of them is really close, so I sometimes stop by.
[09:16:52] <bkero> dimadima: I do
[09:17:00] <dimadima> awesome
[09:17:16] <bkero> I need to do something respectable, after all the other things I do are cycling and computer wankery.
[09:17:54] <manicennui> Portland is really the one city where I felt like I got enough of what I like about Chicago, plus easy access to nature.
[09:19:06] <bkero> There is some lovely nature. Biggest city park of any city in the US right in northwest Portland. I biked about 10 miles of it today. Had a nice sammich and 'booch. https://i.bke.ro/selif/o3w5faom.jpg
[09:19:47] <manicennui> And plenty of opportunities for fighting white supremacists!
[09:20:14] <bkero> There are a lot of Proud Boys who descend upon here who seem to not mind being punched in the face.
[09:20:19] <bkero> Thanks Vantucky.
[09:20:37] <manicennui> Is that what you call Vancouver Washington?
[09:20:44] <bkero> It's what they call themselves
[09:20:48] <manicennui> What do they hope to accomplish, exactly?
[09:21:00] <dimadima> race war?
[09:21:19] <manicennui> Going to a place where basically no one agrees with you to start a race war seems silly.

[09:21:35] <manicennui> bkero: I meant by starting shit in Portland specifically.
[09:22:14] <bkero> The're looking to be challenged to legitimize themselves.
[09:22:57] <bkero> Bring racism back into that Overton window.
[09:23:27] <manicennui> I suppose.
[09:23:40] <manicennui> I also suppose they aren't smart enough to figure out ways to be truly effective.
[09:24:04] <dimadima> i wouldn't underestimate them
[09:25:07] <bkero> Remember Charlottesville?
[09:25:15] <manicennui> Sure.
[09:26:14] <manicennui> It makes a bit more sense to do that nonsense in areas where they have a lot of support and are still not fully blue.
[09:28:00] <manicennui> I get that much of Oregon is still rural and goes Republican, but the valley is firmly Democratic, and where most of the people are.
[09:28:03] <bkero> I can see how that would be easier, bu I don't think it would have nearly the magnitude of effect.
[09:28:16] <bkero> It's much more impressive if the mayor bans you from town or something.
[09:28:23] <bkero> Then you get to scream about civil liberties
[09:29:20] <dimadima> they want action and they want attention
[09:30:18] <dimadima> maybe less action and more attention, really
[09:32:17] <dimadima> so i think that's why they go into places like portland
[09:32:50] <dimadima> i think they have a westboro baptist church kind of thing going on in that regard
[09:33:17] <manicennui> I don't feel like Westboro accomplished much other than annoying people though.
[09:35:23] <manicennui> I guess I just don't understand their 5d chess.
[09:36:25] <manicennui> dimadima: I just saw this but haven't read it: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-problem-of-marital-loneliness
[09:36:25] <buttsbot> The Problem of Marital Loneliness | The New Yorker
[09:40:56] <dimadima> yeah i don't think the proud boys will either but i'm weary of nazi-type movements
[09:41:12] <dimadima> especially given recent history
[09:41:30] <dimadima> thanks for the link looks relevant
[09:42:10] <dimadima> yikes: >y husband is really into geometry, and once he‚Äôs mastered a complicated proof he likes to go through it with me in exacting detail. If he sees my eyes wandering, he commands me to pay attention.
[09:42:16] <dimadima> :|
[09:43:40] <manicennui> "Viewed by roughly half of Sweden, the series was reputed to be responsible for a rise in the country‚Äôs divorce rates."
[09:43:45] <manicennui> That's impressive.
[09:44:13] <manicennui> Apparently there is a remake on HBO now.
[09:44:43] <manicennui> "a Jewish philosophy professor played by Oscar Isaac"
[09:44:47] <manicennui> Now I might have to watch this.
[09:47:39] <manicennui> Eh. The HBO version sounds bad.
[09:48:40] <manicennui> Americans and their desire for unambiguously happy endings.
[09:52:06] <dimadima> alright i'm off to sleep. goodnight

[22:20:13] <manicennui> Cryptocurrency still just seems insane to me.
[22:20:39] <manicennui> Use a bunch of resources to create something with no intrinsic value, backed by nothing, so people can gamble.
[22:21:58] <gerikson> libertarianism is a hell of a drug
[22:22:03] <riv> the whole point of bitcoin is to buy in early, then trick people into thinking its useful
[22:22:03] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[22:22:24] <riv> that way your early investment blows up. these new people just need to continue the scam

[22:43:08] <gerikson> using 'they' is easier tho
[23:14:18] <dimadima> i'm not even sure a person's presentation is supposed to indicate their pronouns
