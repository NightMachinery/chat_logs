[00:02:22] <pierrot> When calling $ChanObj->GetNicks() from Perl (using the perlmod module), what's the returned data structure? Is it a hash, a hash reference... ?
[00:02:55] <MetaNova> consider asking in #znc-dev
[00:03:10] <MetaNova> higher concentration of people interested/capable of answering such questions there

[05:07:34] <Netboy3> quesker: znc buffers do not clear out if it looses connection with the IRC network. this never happened to me. for example if your client did not connect to znc the whole day and one of the irc networks went down for an hour. when your client connects to znc, znc will play back a day's full of playback (except that one hour when it couldn't reach the network

[05:09:39] <gothkat> oh shoot i started to type an answer and just didn't finish. but ya... what Netboy3 says. or quesker did you mean the connection between your irc client and your znc?
[05:14:26] <Khaytsus> I've heard this a few times honestly...  that the playback resets on network reconnect.  the logs aren't lost, but playback is reset.  I'm always connected so I'd never notice myself :/
[05:15:45] <MetaNova> cannot replicate, my connection is too stable
[05:16:01] <gothkat> i have a pretty stable connection to most places but i have one network that tends to drop every day or two. as far as i can tell i get a full playback. but i can keep a closer eye on it
[05:16:22] <MetaNova> this isn't the first time I've heard the claim, though
[05:16:25] <gothkat> For testing it might be sufficient to ghost yourself off from another connection?

[09:04:55] <KindOne> gothkat, If you really want to part everything both client and znc: "/join 0"
[09:07:55] <gothkat> That's what i've used in the past, but i hit one network that sends you to #0 instead of parting. 
[09:24:15] <KindOne> Looks like znc is doing something wrong.
[09:25:18] <gothkat> Oh? as far as i know it works on other networks. admittedly i haven't tried by telnet to see exactly what is happening. i could test
[09:29:28] <KindOne> https://gist.github.com/RealKindOne/61b31094783f7c0b418187fb3f363155... yeah, its being weird.
[09:31:40] <KindOne> I'll update to 1.8.2 and test it some more.
[09:33:35] <gothkat> Weird that it seems to work on other networks
[09:34:13] <KindOne> with or without znc?
[09:36:16] <gothkat> with 
[09:36:31] <gothkat> I need to test more and i'm not in a position to part on the network where i think it happens
[09:36:45] <KindOne> what network/ircds?
[09:37:13] <gothkat> But i used to "/allserv join 0" when i was done for the night.
[09:37:39] <gothkat> (In HexChat)
[09:38:43] <gothkat> I'm not 100% sure. i think it is cuff-link.me, running version InspIRCd-3 but i really need to test a bit further. it could be that something is more broken than i noticed
[09:39:08] <KindOne> I think znc is doing something dumb
[09:40:37] <gothkat> Ok ya znc is
[09:41:21] <gothkat> Tried on undernet, /raw join gkgkgkgkgk sets #gkgkgkgkgk to trying, and it joins after a few moments. but not instantly like /raw join #gkgkgkgkgk
[09:41:54] <gothkat> Same with joining 0, it starts trying #0 
[09:44:24] <gothkat> But... cuff-link doesn't part all when you "raw join 0" while other networks do, so i'm back to where i started. my znc must have gotten upgraded when the #0 thing started and i didn't notice
[09:44:44] <gothkat> Sorry for the misdirection
[09:47:35] <KindOne> Im filing a bug report.
