[03:02:43] <jtgd> so there is some sort of interface that translates X calls into Waypand?
[03:02:49] <jtgd> *Wayland
[03:02:50] <thrice> no, as I wrote, most gtk3, Qt5, etc. apps work already
[03:02:58] <jtgd> ok
[03:03:09] <jtgd> then what is the advantage of it?

[08:16:23] <susi> ofc, but you could have both :) Arch is about optimizing your experience
[08:16:34] <SponiX> Yeah... I just keep it at a ever other week or so thing
[08:16:36] <kevr> exactly.
[08:17:00] <SponiX> susi: for me Arch is about just having my shit work, and not having to dick with it all the time :)
[08:17:23] <SponiX> If I wanted that, I'd have Gentoo on here
[08:19:16] <susi> I used to have Gentoo and like it, but I think Arch's almost as much work anyways
[08:19:43] <susi> you set up your system and try to make it as optimal and snappy and fine you could, but it only needs to be done ~once
[08:20:15] <kevr> lol
[08:20:17] <susi> of course updating/installing takes a bit longer on Gentoo, but the amount of work is basically the same once thing's are configured

[08:28:24] <susi> kevr: Gentoo's fine-grained and if you don't especially want to tune too much you're USE flags individually for every program etc, what's the difference... just installing software and configuring it :-)

[08:38:33] <kevr> you don't just set arch up once and it's good for life
[08:38:44] <susi> even though basically it's just about installing the needed software, and replacing a bunch of config fales
[08:38:50] <kevr> arch's major thing is that its bleeding edge, and eventually, you are going to have to reconfigure things
[08:39:49] <kevr> and that's a good thing for people who want to stay up to date with software on their distro.

[08:40:17] <susi> yeah but I'm that type that wants to 'optimize' every little piece of their system, and it ends up somehow 'custom'

[17:15:14] *** Joins: feriman (~feriman@188.163.113.151)
[17:15:37] <[-_-]> I think both, but most importantly user@1000.service

[17:16:12] <[-_-]> so I think I understand that, but then I do not understand user@1000.service
[17:16:44] <[-_-]> From my pov user@1000.service is available after user 1000 logs in
[17:16:49] <[-_-]> Am I correct?
[17:17:14] <thurstylark> apparently it's got it's own manpage

[17:18:57] <thurstylark> So, basically, Before=user@1000.service means "If you're starting the user manager for UID 1000, start this unit first, *then* start that one"
[17:19:09] <[-_-]> that is my problem

[17:19:47] <TiZ> Okay wow it looks like just grabbing the missing files from the git repo at the release tag has allowed it to start building

[17:20:09] <Tom^> TiZ: just build xorg-server-git :p

[17:21:22] <TiZ> Tom^: I suppose that's fair enough, and besides... the build ended up failing anyways lmao
[17:21:52] <Tom^> TiZ: however it also means building uh xorgproto and libx11 and uh any xf86-video/input drivers.
[17:22:22] <TiZ> I have to ask myself if AsyncFlipSecondaries is that important to me...
[17:22:33] <TiZ> ...and I think it is, at least enough to try building it
[17:22:36] <thurstylark> [-_-]: yep. also it's not just that the user@.service is available, but it literally is the systemd --user instance for the specified UID, so this is also a good way to get things done before that is started

[18:28:57] <SysGhost> kernel ring buffer can sometimes reveal sensitive information. Hence the change to require some privileges to access it. most logs one usually need are accessible through journalctl anyway.

[18:33:10] <SysGhost> long story short, a quote from a mailing list asking the very question of "why?":
[18:33:11] <SysGhost> The kernel syslog contains debugging information that is often useful during exploitation of other vulnerabilities, such as kernel heap addresses. Rather than futilely attempt to sanitize hundreds (or thousands) of printk statements and simultaneously cripple useful debugging functionality, it is far simpler to create an option that prevents unprivileged users from reading the syslog.

[23:47:03] <robbert> Hi all, could someone help me with a sway/wofi question. When I startup Firefox using 'wofi --show drun' - the print file dialog hangs. When I start it up using 'wofi --show run' it works. Looking at the desktop item I guess it's the same executable, no arguments. Is it a different 'execute' function?

[23:56:15] <mongy> hola
[23:56:16] <robbert> No - I'm not using the final command. I'll give it try. Thx. 
[23:56:33] <robbert> Hi naamgenoot ;)
[23:56:44] * mongy just uses fzf and zsh ..
[23:57:27] <d10n> I have a USB hub (switch) with a mouse and keyboard attached. When I plug in the hub, my desktop freezes for a second (audio continues playing). When I remove the hub, there is no similar freeze. I haven't found any useful Google results. Any ideas?
[23:57:44] <kevr> take it out
[23:57:49] <d10n> ha
[23:57:49] <mongy> robbert: not sayin that's the issue, but it's a recommendation anyway.
[23:57:52] <kevr> run `journalctl -k -f`
[23:58:01] <kevr> then plug it in and see what it says, and what takes so long
