[00:35:47] <Spawns_Carpeting> I am trying to write some ebuilds for emacs addons like company mode for example, and most ebuilds also add a site-lisp config file that adds the site-lisp path to 'load-path and also autoloads some functions
[00:35:58] <Spawns_Carpeting> Is autoloading functions required?
[00:36:16] <Spawns_Carpeting> or can emacs file the package so long as I add it to 'load-path?
[00:36:23] <Spawns_Carpeting> file=find
[00:36:24] <tali713> Spawns_Carpeting: autolading functions is desirable, but not strictly speaking required.
[00:36:39] *** Joins: _thelion_ (~user@88-117-120-157.adsl.highway.telekom.at)
[00:37:05] <Spawns_Carpeting> the basic idea of the autoload function is you just give it the function, a string version of the function name, a desc, and then a true or false right>?
[00:37:24] <tali713> Spawns_Carpeting: those are distinct concerns, if it's on your load-path it can be loaded/required etc.  If it has registered autoloads then when an auto-loaded function is invoked it wil load the library.
[00:37:42] <Spawns_Carpeting> oh that makes sense
[00:37:50] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[00:38:08] <tali713> Spawns_Carpeting: so e.g. a person can do M-x $foo-mode RET and load the library automatically.
[00:38:31] <Spawns_Carpeting> that makes a lot more sense, otherwise you would need to manually require or load it right?

[00:39:13] <Spawns_Carpeting> thanks
[00:39:18] <tali713> Spawns_Carpeting: exactly, which isn't neccesarilly wrong.  like if the package in question is strictly a library, auto-loads are less good because any package that uses it should declare it require's it anyways.

[01:45:47] <Spawns_Carpeting> does emacs check package signatures by default in recent times when installing over the net?
[01:46:38] <hoppity> Spawns_Carpeting: I don't think it does
[01:46:39] <wasamasa> if they are available and gpg is installed
[01:46:47] <wasamasa> see `package-check-signature'
[01:47:00] <wasamasa> so in practice, only on linux machines and with GNU ELPA
[01:47:04] <Spawns_Carpeting> does anyone here use treemacs btw?
[01:47:15] <Spawns_Carpeting> right on melpa it doesn't
[01:47:21] <Spawns_Carpeting> or other repos
[01:47:43] <wasamasa> well, nonGNU ELPA might add another five signed packages, lol
[01:48:19] <Spawns_Carpeting> it seems like treemacs is a fairly popular and used in doomemacs or spacemacs. I just like to check that it's safe before installing it on my main machine outside of a VM
[01:48:41] <Spawns_Carpeting> i am going to add some of these packages to the gentoo user repo as well

[07:09:39] <bpalmer> alphapapa[m]: I can't find any reference to that. Google famously has android statues; Facebook famously has a sign with its logo/name facing outwards and a sign with Sun microsystems facing inward (Facebook bought Sun's old campus)
[07:10:30] <bpalmer> Facebook supposedly keeps Sun's image around as a reminder about how quickly big companies can fall.
[07:10:32] <alphapapa[m]> bpalmer: According to Wikipedia (...), the slogan was once Google's motto, then they got rid of it.
[07:11:01] <twb> bpalmer: sun didn't fail!  It was bought out by a major multinational!

[07:16:14] <bpalmer> That "don't be evil" was removed.
[07:17:00] <alphapapa[m]> bpalmer: That it was removed from what?

[10:01:29] <famubu> I just got into emacs, so I thought I better start small.. :D
[10:01:41] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: depends on context, but could be.  Not really concerened with it though, I just want things to work, and I don't always know what map I'm applying the binding too.
[10:02:00] <famubu> magit is on my list though. after I get proof general right.
[10:02:16] <tali713> famubu: You can certainly eval-after-load or use a hook, but evalling-after-load in a hook seems redundant.
[10:02:36] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: Not knowing which map you're binding a key in might lead to problems down the line.  ;)  It's pretty easy to find out which map to use.  e.g. "C-h k" gives some info about that.
[10:03:25] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: I;ll let you know when that happens, never has.
[10:03:33] <tali713> not in the past decade anyways.
[10:03:45] <famubu> tali713: No, I was thinking of going just one. Either hook or eval-after-load. (whichever one that works)
[10:04:17] <tali713> famubu: if it works when evalled directly (local-bind-key) then it will work in a hook function.
[10:05:33] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: you misunderstand, if I am applying a key to <the current mode-map> I'm not going to rewriet that for each and every mode-map I might apply it too, I have no need of such extra work for the sake of work.
[10:06:16] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: If you want to bind an overriding key globally, the bind-key* macro can do that easily.

[10:24:21] <famubu> While associating a key combination to an elisp function, is it possible to pass arguments to that function as well? Or should it always be a no argument function?
[10:25:03] <mattf> interactive ?
[10:25:04] <fsbot> interactive is [0] When a function is invoked interactively, emacs needs to know how to provide the necessary arguments. Interactive provides this information. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

[10:26:08] <MysteriousSilver> :\
[10:26:14] <tali713> when you define an interactive function (a command) you can set how each argument is dertermined.
[10:26:28] <mattf> oh sorry famubu you mean create a keybind that calls a function passing constant parameters to ita
[10:26:37] <mattf> like this: `(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c 0") (lambda () (interactive) (default-text-scale-increment 40)))`
[10:26:58] <tali713> famubu: if you are asking if you can decide a priori what arguments to pass to an arbitrary command, the answer is define an interactive command that calls it non-interactively and bind to that.

[11:06:58] <wgreenhouse> the proposal I'm hearing is for sbcl-style, having the interpreter be a special case of the compiler rather than have the two be fairly separate and different machines that might behave differently in some odd cases (not necessarily related to which binding discipline the language follows)
[11:07:30] <mattf> very nice job on ement alphapapa[m] !!!
[11:07:33] <rdrg109> [Q][edebug] Let's say I'm instrumenting a function. Is it possible to eval sexps on a parameter which exists in the scope of the function? I've tried to use the minibuffer but I only get => eval: Symbol’s value as variable is void: xyz

[11:08:04] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: the issue is as wgreenhouse implies.  maintaining paralel machines to do the same task is prone to issues.
[11:08:09] <alphapapa[m]> I mean, AFAIK there are no meaningful differences between the results of code run in the interpreter and the byte-compiler, other than speed.  There aren't supposed to be, anyway.
[11:08:19] <alphapapa[m]> thanks mattf, glad you like it

[11:10:41] <alphapapa[m]> tali713: There's been some discussion that I've seen on emacs-devel regarding the different Elisp implementations in Emacs, especially surrounding native-comp.  I suppose it might be nice to consolidate them, but that would probably be a lot of work, and for how much gain?

[11:11:12] <mattf> oh yes
[11:11:14] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: the other side is speed.  compiled code is faster, there is no reason to also have an interpretter if eval is compile/execute.  For the user there is no appreciable difference.  the problem with it is bootstrapping (though I don't think that would currently be an issue for emacs)

[11:13:14] <tali713> alphapapa[m]: yeah, I'm not suggesting gathering evrything together or making wide sweeping changes, I just mean changing the definition of eval (which yes is a tricky task, but it's just one task)
[11:13:39] <alphapapa[m]> mattf: What was the current buffer when you called ement-room-join?
[11:14:01] <mattf> oh it was some elisp file of my config
[11:14:05] <wgreenhouse> tali713: I still haven't run native-comp, but I think I read it implicitly compiles on load, which is a big step in this direction.
[11:14:45] <alphapapa[m]> mattf: The command is intended to be called from an Ement buffer, that's how it knows which session to join from.  I guess I could try to make that smarter.
[11:14:56] <tali713> wgreenhouse: that sounds nice, I'm still somewhat skeptical of native-comp, bytecomp is pretty good.

[11:24:18] <mattf> I heard of that !
[11:24:19] <alphapapa[m]> mattf: If you use Emacs's commands to navigate by sexp rather than by character or line, that won' be a problem
[11:24:30] <mattf> nein nein nein!
[11:24:40] <mattf> im not ready for that :P
[11:24:50] <tali713> yup, and the if you use something like paredit you can easily maniputalte by sexp, and parens are great for making that easy.
[11:24:55] <alphapapa[m]> I mean, it's just C-M-f, no big deal
[11:24:58] <alphapapa[m]> works in many modes, not just lisp

[11:25:30] <alphapapa[m]> then throw in a little C-M-u, and you can do a lot
[11:25:39] <mattf> oh damn, i will have to check your prism project out !
[11:25:51] <alphapapa[m]> I even use C-M-u to get out of strings
[11:26:12] <alphapapa[m]> yeah I really enjoy editing Lisp with Prism
[11:26:51] <alphapapa[m]> and don't forget about C-M-a.  The key bindings for movement in Emacs are very consistent and well-designed.
[11:27:00] <tali713> mattf: that's the major advantage of balanced delimiters is how easy it is for a machine to ensure correct indentation and navigating by semanticly meaningful steps.
[11:27:04] <alphapapa[m]> Want to do a bigger movement?  Add another modifier, but the principle is the same.
[11:28:04] <tali713> When I first learned lisp I thought I had to count parens, I was foolish, the machine should do that for me.
[11:28:30] <alphapapa[m]> It would help a lot if Emacs enabled electric-pair-mode by default in Lisp buffers
[11:28:38] <tali713> agreed
[11:28:53] <mattf> it is not thaaat much readable specially with the way people are formating it closing all parenthesis in the end of functions. ))))))) 
[11:29:07] <tali713> paredit (or some future included equivalent) might be too much, but electric pairs is smart.
[11:29:13] <mattf> if you depend on a machine to help you read it is not good enough! but i think you could just format it differently
[11:29:22] <mattf> ive been doing this on my configs
[11:29:27] <alphapapa[m]> mattf: the idea is to let the editor handle the parens for you.  You don't need to see them on their own lines like in other languages.

[14:03:51] <tako> Hi!, i'm trying to build a function that add a new tmux window with the current directory. (start-process "tmux" nil "tmux" "new-window" "-c" default-directory) seems to works fine, but the default-directory it's always ~/ and not the current dired directory openend with dired. Any ideas ? ( I'm currently learning elisp, so forgive me if this question sounds dumb.. )
[14:04:40] <Enfors> What's the syntax for globally binding a key to call a function WITH AN ARGUMENT? I'm trying to bind a key to visit a certain file. This is what I'm trying: (global-set-key (kbd "C-x j") '(find-file "~/my-file.org"))

[19:16:48] <mmontone> Hello. I'm looking for a way to intercept any character press (letters from a to z), and run a function for them, in a minor mode I'm implementing.
[19:16:59] <mmontone> Does anyone know how I can do that?
[19:17:00] <acdw> zebrag: looks like you did ,,org-shiftmetadown
[19:17:02] <fsbot> fsbot loves you!
[19:17:23] <acdw> welp i messed up that thing. but yeah. it just shifted the line down into a properties drawer. you can pull it back out i think
[19:17:56] <acdw> mmontone: i /think/ you'd want to look @ hooking into or advising self-insert-function.... tho that might be a big hammer
[19:18:00] *** Joins: peterhil (~peterhil@mobile-access-5d6ace-52.dhcp.inet.fi)
[19:18:26] <mmontone> Ok. I'll look at that ..
[19:18:36] <bpalmer> mmontone: the simplest way is to have your minor mode use a keymap that binds commands to the keys you want to "intercept"
[19:18:46] <bpalmer> minor mode keymaps are consulted before the major mode keymap
[19:18:53] <mmontone> aha..but I'd like to be generic
[19:19:02] <bpalmer> (which is consulted before the global keymap, which is where self-insert-command is usually found)
[19:19:12] <bpalmer> mmontone: what do you mean?
[19:19:13] <mmontone> so I can have a function tht receives the character and acts, it is ithe same function for every character
[19:19:31] <mmontone> something like:
[19:19:37] <zebrag> acdw: Yes, I expected it to move the entry=whole subtree, downward, but instead it moved the headline only, downward, right into the property drawer. That was unexpected
[19:19:45] <mmontone> (bind-key "A-Z" 'my-handler)
[19:19:46] <bpalmer> mmontone: sure. Bind to a command that inspects what keyboard events triggered it, the same way that (essentially) self-insert-command works
[19:19:53] <mmontone> my-handler receives the character
[19:20:14] <mmontone> Ok. Haven't looked at self-insert-command. Will have a look.
[19:20:18] <bpalmer> mmontone: why do you insist on that interface?
[19:20:40] <mmontone> what would be an alternative?
[19:20:52] <bpalmer> a command that is run can examine things like last-command-event
[19:20:58] <bpalmer> or last-input-event
[19:21:31] <mmontone> and how do I trigger that command on every character press?
[19:21:33] <bpalmer> or C-h v this-command-keys RET

[19:23:00] <mmontone> but then I have to define-key for every character
[19:23:29] <mmontone> can do that, but I liked the generic handler option more
[19:23:56] <bpalmer> you can set the default binding for a keymap, or you can trivially loop over the characters you want to bind
[19:24:01] <makomo_> mmontone: keymaps can have "default" bindings. that might be useful
[19:24:33] <zebrag> I've got helm `installed`, pretty sure about that, but it is not "started", it is not suggesting completions. How do I start it?
[19:24:34] <mmontone> ah. didn't know about those default bindings. will have a look at that too. thanks!
[19:24:51] <acdw> zebrag: that is pretty weird, i agree. def not what i'd expect. i feel like there's a few things about org that are that way

[21:41:20] <zebrag> So the bottom of the issue is, someone found it useful to add (org-refile) entries to some bookmark list around 2010. And recently someone found it useful to put highlight overly over anything bookmark. And there might be additional bugs over it preventing the bookmark-delete form something.
