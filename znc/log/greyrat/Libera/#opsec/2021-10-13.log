[16:02:13] <Joanna> This channel is about security and  though. Anyone else here program?
[16:04:10] <JimBuntu> Howdy Joanna 
[16:05:34] <Joanna> JimBuntu: do you do security related things ?
[16:05:40] <Joanna> For work ?
[16:06:39] <Joanna> I can’t remember
[16:07:47] <JimBuntu> Joanna, not so much any more, but it everyone's resposibility to pay attention and ask questions if they suspect something isn't right.
[16:08:14] <Joanna> I was thinking today about how many security problems are possible because of things being less mechanical than they used to be.
[16:08:59] <Joanna> JimBuntu: sometimes people are afraid to ask questions or don’t notice anything wrong
[16:09:43] <JimBuntu> Can't do very much about people not noticing, aside from training them on what to look for.  It's a bad environment if people are afraid of asking questions. imho
[16:09:48] <Joanna> For instance pipelines were once purely mechanical
[16:10:48] <Joanna> People who question the status quo are outliers I’ve found.
[16:11:48] <Joanna> People definitely can’t question orders from authority figures usually
[16:15:10] <JimBuntu> I guess it depends on the system.  Some systems expect each person to function simply as an extension of the authority figure.  I think information sharing plays a large part in this as well.  If a group all have the same information, there should be a higher chance of agreement.  If a small subset of the population of that group have a monopoly on the information, then trust doesn't come from agreement as
[16:15:13] <JimBuntu> much as from past experiences that following the orders were the right thing to do.
[16:19:04] <Joanna> If it’s a big organization like the military it won’t work too well if people ask questions in fact they weed out people who ask questions early.
[16:20:15] <micronn> people may interpret the same information in different ways
[16:21:10] *** portalrat_ is now known as portalrat
[16:22:15] <Joanna> micronn: that is the crux of the problem. Different people have different experiences and very strong opinions about things:)
[16:22:30] <JimBuntu> In a highly structured environment, like many militaries, there are various duties and responsibilities.  Some people are required to be thinkers, others mostly those that do as they are told, but even in this situation everyone has base responsibilities and very few are required to act without thinking.  Sure, there is the timeframe when someone is being initially trained and such, but once they are assigned
[16:22:32] <JimBuntu> a duty, then they must always obey certain rules despite what they are told (except for those cases where they really are intended to be a remote extension of their handler)
[16:24:05] <JimBuntu> To be clear, I'm not saying in any instance someone should simply disobey, simply that they are expected to use their judgement to make sure basic principals are being followed
[16:24:42] <Joanna> I’m not sure where the thinkers in military arrive only met the ones who dogmatically follow regulations
[16:24:45] <JimBuntu> Pure democracy hasn't worked out that well in the past.
[16:25:10] <micronn> wouldn't always obey the same certain rules make the system less adaptative?
[16:25:34] <Joanna> Nope I think in Ancient Greece there was more direct democracy
[16:25:38] <JimBuntu> tons and tons and tons of thinkers in militaries... I mean, mostly gone are the days of lining people up on a battlefield to die until one side can't suffer any more attrition.
[16:26:40] <JimBuntu> micronn, yes, somewhat less adaptable by definition.  Take most any law enforcement group you can think of though, they have a basic oath of basic principals they must uphold above all else (not saying they are good at doing it, just that it's an expectation)
[16:26:44] <Joanna> Isn’t military policy dictated by civilians? Unless it’s a military dictatorship where a general is president of country
[16:27:36] <JimBuntu> Citizens, more often than simply civilians.  How you want to rank/title congress and such is up to you, but they aren't simply common civilians.
[16:28:53] <JimBuntu> Ancient Greece as an example... where are they now?
[16:30:02] <Joanna> Long gone :)
[16:33:25] <Joanna> I think even if people take an oath they can be convinced to do things that counteract the oath later if they are given some rationale by an authority figure. There have been many experiments on this sort of stuff
[16:34:06] <Joanna> Sure some might refuse but many will not
[16:34:28] <JimBuntu> For sure, people are very corruptable
[16:36:15] <Joanna> Oftentimes they just can be manipulated even if it’s not in their best interest
[16:37:11] <Joanna> They call it sunk cost people don’t want to walk away from something they put a lot of effort into
[16:37:54] <JimBuntu> Great Apes form groups of groups of groups, we like dividing power and responsibility.  The best way to get someone to do something 'bad' is to remove their responsibility for the action.  This is one of the reasons why it's better to have people question/think

[16:38:39] <JimBuntu> "I'm a professional.  I was just doing my job.  I was commanded to." are not free-passes
[16:38:50] <Joanna> Hey _inky welcome back
[16:39:44] <Joanna> Unfortunately people don’t always think of the consequences of what they are doing they just don’t want to lose their jobs
[16:42:21] <jessicara> yeah this is a common misconception, probably because it actually used to be like this for other militaries in the past
[16:42:35] <jessicara> that are expected to obey everything robotically
[16:42:44] <JimBuntu> Our internal/hidden bias on various things is why I think it's better to have a group paying attention.  For a super simple example: user interface design... color blindness is pretty common yet until someone even in a group are mindful of it, it can be overlooked.
[16:42:51] <jessicara> it is not like this in american army/navy/etc
[16:43:32] <Joanna> All militaries that I know of subject people to harsh treatment in training at least
[16:43:40] <jessicara> yeah basic
[16:43:59] <jessicara> as far as i can tell basic is mostly to weed out those who are actually unfit for the physical side
[16:44:11] <JimBuntu> Need to make sure the person can handle it and need to make sure they know they can handle it, for just a couple reasons behind harsh seeming basic
[16:44:33] <jessicara> yeah, basic is nothing compared to being in a secret prison in a country with no human rights
[16:45:13] <Joanna> It’s more than just physical. They make them do all sorts of ridiculous things such as folding T-shirts into 6 inch squares.
[16:45:19] <jessicara> yeah
[16:45:33] <jessicara> habit forming for later
[16:46:09] <jessicara> there is a psychological side too, but i'm not sure how much is based on not so good theories these days
[16:46:45] <Joanna> Some basic training is torture . They have sleep deprivation , stress positions and the works
[16:47:51] <Joanna> Along with psychological abuse having someone screaming insults in your face
[16:48:17] <Joanna> Anyone ever see the movie full metal jacket?
[16:48:48] <Joanna> The guy gets beaten up by his peers in middle of night

[16:50:30] <micronn> "The best way to get someone to do something 'bad' is to remove their responsibility for the action." <-- maybe the way we look at responsibility is the key here: some bad orders would change, but for responsibility issues, they are keep
[16:52:14] <micronn> things like, if they change the order it means they knew it was wrong
[16:53:12] <Joanna> You know what they do is they get people focused on other things they don’t really think about if they are doing something bad they just obey
[16:54:16] <Joanna> I think it’s kind of unfair to blame the flunkies they are victims as well in many cases.
[16:54:54] <Joanna> The people at top seldom suffer the consequences of the orders they give
[16:55:28] <Joanna> I guess people should try to be more mindful and read some history books!

[17:04:50] <JimBuntu> and they join out of a feeling of tradition and of course the benefits packages are important for some
[17:05:24] <Joanna> Yes they turn off their fear and assume they will be victorious .  Societies who are too cowardly to risk death are crushed by those willing to take risks
[17:06:16] <Joanna> JimBuntu: but as always being in the military often results in a violent death
[17:06:35] <JimBuntu> I don't think 'often' is the right word, and which military makes a big difference
[17:07:35] <Joanna> If you are in the more powerful military your chances of death are lower
[17:07:45] <JimBuntu> You can look up 'Active Duty Military Deaths by Year and Manner' for some militaries
[17:12:59] <Joanna> https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/study-reveals-android-phones-constantly-snoop-on-their-users/
[17:13:13] <JimBuntu> Yup. Of course they do :)
[17:13:43] <JimBuntu> Pretty much most if not all smart devices snoop on the users... most apps running on them too... there is a lot to learn from those analytics
[17:13:58] <Joanna> JimBuntu: I was thinking there is such a simple solution to spying phones and that’s mechanical switches
[17:14:37] <Joanna> There was once a time when cellphones couldn’t track you
[17:14:44] <JimBuntu> Even way back when most of the phone grid in the USA was still mechanical, we still literally tape recorded many calls... everything going overseas for example
[17:15:03] <jessicara> a bit more work, but back then could still tell where a signal was coming from
[17:15:21] <Joanna> How was it done ?
[17:15:31] <jessicara> radio waves take time to travel
[17:15:38] <Joanna> Ah
[17:15:56] <jessicara> record at 2 places with accurate timing, it's like ears, add a third and you can figure out which side it came from
[17:16:14] <jessicara> human brain actually does a similar thing with sound timing
[17:16:28] <Joanna> It was once possible to remove battery from phone
[17:16:35] <Joanna> Easily
[17:16:48] <jessicara> yeah, these days there's a high chance will be caught out by a surprise cable in an awkward place
[17:16:54] <JimBuntu> Still possible for some phones, but I agree, many are no longer capable without more dissassembly
[17:17:12] <Joanna> Flip phones
[17:17:24] <jessicara> people seem to design things almost as if don't want them repaired
[17:17:33] <JimBuntu> lol, for sure
[17:17:35] <Joanna> Has anyone ever tried faraday cage for phone?
[17:17:39] <jessicara> like if take apart a lot of stuff, will actually damage it if make sane assumptions
[17:17:40] <JimBuntu> yeah.
[17:17:56] <JimBuntu> We used to have to use cages for phones and some custom embedded computers, for testing
[17:18:00] <jessicara> or in one case apparently get a huge shock from capacitors out in the open storing a lot
[17:18:34] <Joanna> Ouch can you wear rubber gloves or something?
[17:18:40] <JimBuntu> nowadays though Joanna , you can simply buy bags that block the radio waves more than well enough

[17:20:11] <jessicara> i'm yet to have found a reason to take a phone with me somewhere
[17:20:42] <jessicara> i bet it will happen once i've stopped taking it anywhere entirely for a while, finding a reason when don't have it
[17:21:38] <JimBuntu> I think the need/helpfulness of carrying a phone around really depends on what you depend on that phone for... now that they are somewhat powerful computers, lots of usefulness... although you can replace the phone with a tablet/pda anyhow
[17:22:02] <jessicara> yeah, powerful computers with a not so nice interface to use the power
[17:22:15] <jessicara> like 8 core arm thing, has surprisingly decent gpu even
[17:22:30] <JimBuntu> Well, I have terminal access on mine and have for the last several
[17:22:52] <jessicara> i don't, and really don't like the idea of typing anything shell/c on it without a keyboard

[21:45:57] * Bitweasil reads up, being in the process of abandoning phones too.
[21:47:23] <Bitweasil> I've thought of some Raspberry Pi based tablets or something.  Even Android/iOS tablets are now probably regarded as evil. :(

[22:37:07] <JimBuntu> Well, according to Apple and their sources that I don't remember the details of... the Android ecosphere has about 47x the amount of Malware compared to iOS.  Sure, there will be some bias there, but not 47x worth. Either way, it's mostly about the tack-ons
[22:39:46] <JimBuntu> If you start with AOSP and control what apps are installed, you could probably do fine... problem is that almost every device out there from trustworthy builders will not be AOSP, it will be some bloated version.

[22:51:28] <Bitweasil> Correct.  And so the right answer is simply not to find less-evil ways of participating in a toxic ecosystem, but to opt out.
[22:52:20] <JimBuntu> You'll probably have to custom build... or opt out.  IF you have the time/resources, you could help in various ways to clean the ecosystems, but that's a different topic
[22:53:36] <JimBuntu> I think of the mobile devices more as a platform that allow me to connect with 'normal'systems, although, thanks to software like Termux (and others) I'm still able to have minimal on-board development
[22:54:22] <Bitweasil> I've gone to a "dumb" phone, and it supports a hotspot so I can use a laptop for more complex stuff.
[22:54:35] <Bitweasil> There's still too much that goes on with SMS/phone calls to not have one, but it's no longer "smart."
[22:55:51] <JimBuntu> That works, in passing I would simply say not to forget to use a different set of DNS than what might come from the ISP/CARRIER
[22:56:18] <Bitweasil> *shrug*  Why?  DNS isn't well protected.
[22:56:27] <Bitweasil> And I usually SSH to IPs if I'm using a laptop.
[22:56:40] <Bitweasil> A local dnssec resolver would be nice, but it would be easier to just VPN to something more trusted.
