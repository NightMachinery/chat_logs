[16:23:39] <zothix> Hi, i have a mail server running on docker with network mode Host, i have an other docker instance running for mail client, the mail client can not connect to this mail server unless i set its network mode to Host as well, which i dont want to, how else can i fix this problem?
[16:24:25] <ikke> zothix: add an additional network to the mail server container and connect it to the client container
[16:24:44] <zothix> the way i am connecting to mail server from mail client is by public domain 
[16:24:54] <zothix> such as " example.com 587 "
[16:25:34] <zothix> ikke, as i am connecting with external network should i still make a internal network ?
[16:27:30] <tabakhase> zothix overwrite that adress with for example --add-hot to be the ip your host has on docker0 interface (+ obvs make sure that mailserver is actually bound to all ips/thatIP on the hot via netstat) -- that said, usually that should kinda work with the "public ip" of the host as well i think, but that may depends on routing&firewall specifics so i wondt speak for every OS
[16:28:10] <BtbN> If you connect via your public domain, you either need a special hosts entry to resolve it to the correct internal IP, or your router needs to be able to handle packets to the external IP coming from the internal network
[16:28:56] <zothix> right now it does translate it to IP behind my domain, it just isnt able to connect to it for some reason
[16:29:02] *** Joins: sudomann_ (~sudomann@c-73-133-131-19.hsd1.md.comcast.net)
[16:29:36] <tabakhase> if example.com is "not even the host" - but an even further away router - yea you need fullon hairpinning then - so spoof that with a closer one
[16:30:50] <zothix> tabakhase, i can use direct ip instead of domain, where ip is of the VPS running all dockers
[16:30:56] <zothix> it still doesnt work
[16:31:14] <BtbN> Which is exactly what we just explained.
[16:31:24] <tabakhase> so if you can tell it 172.16.2.1 (or whatever, need to check your actual IP used on docker0 as said) instead of example.com from the start, even better
[16:31:42] <BtbN> You either need an intense hairpin nat config, or need to internally resolve that domain to a different IP (that of the container)
[16:31:59] <zothix> got it
[16:32:12] <zothix> thanks!
[16:32:41] <tabakhase> s/(that of the container)/(that of the host given your container is in host-networking mode)/ ;-)

[21:51:32] <rawtaz> s33ker: what you wrote doesnt make sense, you have to clarify what you are saying here.. please explain - what are you trying to achieve? what problem are you trying to solve?
[21:55:47] <s33ker> i have an image i run it...i use interactive mode to enter the container i install miniconda (for example) i write export PATH="/root/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"   then i detach from container and try to commit this new container as a new image but the path does not persist/exit anmore
[21:56:22] <tabakhase> commit is the devil
[21:57:11] <tabakhase> look into dockerfiles, and you will answer your own question within a few minutes
[21:57:36] <s33ker> yes i am just trying if this works would come in handy when i add more/new packages with pip or conda
[21:57:49] <s33ker> guess need to get use to writing dockerfiles and scripts then
[21:58:01] <rawtaz> commit doesnt like save state like that in any way does it
[21:58:10] <rawtaz> i mean, it's whats in the filesystem that it saves
[21:58:47] <s33ker> so updating dockerfile bashscripts is the way to go then ?

[21:59:28] <s33ker> then building new image every time a upgrade my dockerfile
[22:00:11] <s33ker> It kind of seems easier to just add new things inside container and then save it as new image :P
[22:01:13] <tabakhase> s33ker there is a limited amount of layers one can stack ontop of each other + "docker never deletes anything" -- so over the course of say a year, your 500mb container will have grown to waste 300gb of disk and then break entirely.
[22:02:27] <s33ker> now i get it this is why my 5MB to 2.7 gb when i saved container as an image loool
[22:02:42] <s33ker> is there a way i can read about how this layering works ?
[22:03:39] <tabakhase> likely =) -- common first-time-error is also that pople start to run stuff like "apt-get upgrade" in there containers - what runs into that very same issue (and "by the book is pointless as yur upstream (the FROM) should have a freshly build image for you to use)
[22:04:42] <rawtaz> s33ker: you never answered the question before - what actual problem are you trying to solve?

[22:05:42] *** Joins: c10l (~c10l@user/c10l)

[22:06:07] <s33ker> rawtaz i was trying to build image from container turns out not a good idea
[22:06:29] <s33ker> the path thing was because i cant run conda command if i dont set the path
[22:06:46] <rawtaz> why wouldnt you be able to? just provide the full path to it?
[22:07:08] <rawtaz> then again you can set the PATH env var using ENV
[22:07:10] <s33ker> i have to set the path to run it yes
[22:07:44] <s33ker> hmm env seem not to work on my end did some research i am using alpine linux
[22:07:47] <rawtaz> why wouldnt you have to? just provide the full path to it?
[22:07:57] <rawtaz> ENV is a Dockerfile directive

[22:17:04] <rawtaz> s33ker: what is the actual problem you are having now?
[22:17:12] <rawtaz> and what is unclear?
[22:18:12] <s33ker> rawtaz now i have two files Dockerfile and bashscrpit that dockerfile scrpit runs...what i understand tabakhase is saying is not to use upgrade commands inside my bashscripts
[22:18:31] <tabakhase> *inside containers
[22:18:43] <tabakhase> be that in a dockerfile, in aa baschripts, or by singing&dancing
[22:18:51] <rawtaz> s33ker: what you do depends on what you're trying to achieve.
[22:20:17] <s33ker> tabakhase you never clerified why does it add another layer hance the discspace increses drasticaly ?
[22:21:00] <tabakhase> s33ker cause thats how it is - there isnt rly much more to explain there unless you want to read sourcecode of a onionFS or so :D
[22:21:03] <s33ker> rawtaz to be frank i am trying to use pythonscripts and build an image with it then run a container that runs that python scripts
[22:21:40] <rawtaz> s33ker: you want a contianer that runs python scripts? you can use any python image for that. you have to be more specific, if what i just said isnt a working solution for you
[22:22:27] <tabakhase> for the "how" - random google hit seems about decent but didnt read it all https://martinheinz.dev/blog/44
[22:22:52] <s33ker> so when i run this python image i can write a script inside the container ?
[22:22:53] <rawtaz> if you have a bunch of python scripts you want to run, you could write a bash script that is the one executed when the container starts - this bash scripts then runs the python scripts.
[22:23:15] <rawtaz> s33ker: you really need to understand the basics more - youre just coming across as totally confused about this stuff
[22:23:30] <rawtaz> stop talking aobut "writing a script inside the contianer"
[22:23:45] <rawtaz> why woudl you do that - write your fricken scripts outside the container, then run them in the container if you want to
[22:24:05] <s33ker> rawtaz well you were the one sugessting using python image why would i do that when i can actually make my own ?
[22:24:07] <rawtaz> your contianer is a *runtime* thing, its not what you use to create what you intend to run in it
[22:24:31] <rawtaz> s33ker: i was suggesting a starting point because you are 100% confused about the basics of how all of this stuff works
[22:24:35] <s33ker> i know i have bashscript (where my python code will be) and Dockerfile that runs this bashscrpit
[22:24:39] <tabakhase> s33ker you make your own image by adding your own files -- youre not the one who developed pythong right? so let THEM add THERE files, you build ontop.
[22:24:47] <rawtaz> great. so what is the problem with this - what is currently unclear?
[22:25:17] <s33ker> nothing is really unclear accept the fact that tabakhase suggested not to use upgrade in bashscrpit
[22:25:20] <s33ker> idk why that is tho
[22:25:21] <tabakhase> the docker hub IS your apt-get for the next few weeks to months, it should take a good while before you are allowed todo a "FROM debian/alpine" or such...
[22:25:28] <rawtaz> which upgrade?
[22:25:37] <s33ker> let me give you an example
[22:27:00] <rawtaz> please also show us the entire Dockerfile :) you can use a pastebin.com or similar to show it
[22:27:09] <s33ker> apt-get update....apt-get upgrade...  #then install some system tools for linux -> then install python, conda and so on (this is all inside a bashscripit) then i have a docker file that refrences this script and runs it hance creating an image

[22:28:19] <s33ker> what i wrote
[22:29:28] <tabakhase> if you have a 1gb file and edit 1 bit in it - it will take 2gb in docker   -- if you "rm file" it will actually take MORE diskspace as it has to create a hidden "file.was-actually-deleted" info-file that then hides the real "file"

[22:34:40] <rawtaz> s33ker: you should rewind and reconsider the basics.
[22:35:17] <rawtaz> if you want to use a contianer to run python files, then supply those python files to the container as assets instead of embedding them, OR embed them if it's really suitable to do so, but then at least do it the normal way :P

[22:42:02] <s33ker> this is the docker file i just rewrote it
[22:43:24] <tabakhase> rawtaz so tell me then whats the technical difference for him between a RUN block in a dockerfile and a COPY & run script ((except that 1 extra copy layer)) - the only arguable-nonsense in there is line 18...
[22:43:41] <s33ker> so rawtaz what i got from you that actually most of the bashscrpit (they call install.sh in the book) could actually be in the Dockerfile itself

[22:46:03] <tabakhase> s33ker so then? line 11 in that dockerfile is the very answer to your initial question
[22:47:02] <rawtaz> s33ker: in my opinion, which seems to be wrong according to tabakhase, most of that bash script should be commands in the Dockerfile, yes. i dont see why you'd have that in the bash script and then just wrap that in the Dockerfile. but well, whatever works
[22:47:16] <s33ker> tabakhase in a sence yes but actually my initial question was if i could do this inside a container then comit this container as new image

[22:48:48] <tabakhase> s33ker i dont think so... for the very few rare cases where "commit is allowed" this is usually still hand-in-hand with a dockerfile and just for very specific steps ((and these days most of those cases can be replaced by using buildX features too))
[22:48:57] <rawtaz> s33ker: you cant, and you shouldnt.
[22:49:00] <s33ker> rawtaz ah no worries i get what you are trying to say i think it is a matter of preference to be honest i like the calls from Dockerfile (just me) altho what i get from tabakhase is that it is actually bad to use bashscript since it actually ads a layer to a docker image making it bigger

[22:49:53] <s33ker> guys thank you so much i actually learn a lot i really mean it
