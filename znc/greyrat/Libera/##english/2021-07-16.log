[00:58:08] <ash_worksi> the article states: In English, an indirect object can be animate or inanimate. This is also true in French; however, an indirect object pronoun can replace the indirect object only when it is an animate noun: person or animal.

[00:59:42] *** Joins: arash (~arash@5.124.130.92)
[01:00:23] <ash_worksi> firstly, "indirect objects can be animate or inanimate" is true in any language, because it is true outside the scope of language. It's just true.
[01:01:58] <TimMc> anddam: Reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_adjunct, that seems correct. (re: "bread loaf")
[01:02:26] <ash_worksi> secondly "an indirect object pronoun can replace the indirect object only..." WHAT? When can that ever happen? When you're not saying what you want to say?
[01:02:59] <TimMc> The article mentions "headlinese", and yes, it would *absolutely* be how I'd expect to see it used in a headline! "Bread loaf fiasco reignites" or whatever.
[01:03:16] <ash_worksi> I mean, is that really describing the tautology that if two things are different they are not the same?
[01:04:44] <LuisP14> heh
[01:04:47] <ash_worksi> I mean, I get that their describing a rule, but what the hell are they talking about? It can't be the sentence structure because that's completely different. Indirect object pronouns (I'll say IOP) come before the verb

[01:12:07] <ash_worksi> fais attencion à lui = make/do (pay) attention to him
[01:14:23] <ash_worksi> I am just now realizing they mean that an IOP repleces an ION just by definition of making it abstract.

[01:29:55] <anddam> the advantages of wasting huge chunks of one's life consuming US media
[01:30:57] <ash_worksi> They go on to talk about spotting indirect objects (which I think is stupid, because if you're learning French, you probably want to know construction, not recall, but w/e) and then they say: If it's preceded by any other preposition (as opposed to "to" or "for"), it can't be replaced by an object pronoun.
[01:33:40] <ash_worksi> I don't know exactly what they're communicating. I guess they're saying, "you can't say, `I will ask he´ instead of `I will ask David´" or something
[01:34:42] <ash_worksi> if that's the case, it really should be elaborated: It must be take an IOP instead: `I will ask _him_´
[01:38:54] <ash_worksi> which is all stupid. There's no reason for any of this; your target audience is English (since the article is written in English) so you don't need to explain the nature of a pronoun when the article is explicitly about indirection. And they leave out the most important part; they say, "French IOP's are usually placed in front of hte verb.", I get that that's usually, but then don't just jump into an 
[01:39:00] <ash_worksi> example "fais attencion à lui" without explaining it!

[03:15:27] <GuiToris> how stupid I am, I thought Massachusetts was a city ...
[03:15:28] <TimMc> The citrus, interestingly, are perfectly happy to flower and fruit as houseplants in the winter.
[03:15:29] <tinwhiskers> I'm of the mind that it's easier to move to the tropics

[03:16:07] <tinwhiskers> of course your forego good apples and pipfruit, but it's more than made up for with some of the marvellous tropical fruits.

[03:18:24] <GuiToris> I mean you are a Massachusettsan, but you don't have a Massachusettsan accent?!
[03:18:32] <tinwhiskers> I don't know why we use that term here but it's an official term here "pipfruit industry"

[03:37:35] <GuiToris> https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym "A demonym or gentilic is a word used for people or the inhabitants of a place. The name of a people's language is usually the same as this word"
[03:37:46] <GuiToris> 'usually' does not apply here, right?
[03:38:37] <GuiToris> (I didn't find gentilic either just gentile)
[03:39:08] <TimMc> "Usually" is a bit of a strong claim.
[03:39:49] <tinwhiskers> at a country level that's probably true, but of course it's not with regional names
[03:39:55] <TimMc> A lot of languages can be used as adjectives, but not demonyms: French, Russian, English
[03:40:15] <TimMc> "Frenchman" was a thing, but you don't see that much anymore. :-)
[03:40:30] <GuiToris> I think I found it "In the case of Canadian provinces and territories and U.S. states, demonyms are not usually used as adjectives."
[03:40:52] <GuiToris> I wish I had known this earlier, I've been using them wrong
[03:43:30] <GuiToris> umm wikipedia is terrible: Californian is an adjective describing something related to the American state of California. It is also the demonym for a person from California.

[08:10:58] <twb> elf_fortrez: written English isn't morphophonetic because written languages rarely are, and even when they are, there is drift over the centuries.
[08:11:15] <twb> elf_fortrez: we're using a script originally designed for Latin, and English is a germanic language.
[08:12:48] <elf_fortrez> How about a Norse script for English?

[16:30:07] <xerxes> TimMc: Perl came in 1987. sed probably came in early 1970s. it makes sense. what's surprising is that Perl is actually older than almost all of contemporary popular languages except C/C++.
[16:31:03] <xerxes> TimMc: that's also because `TimToady` is a genius.
[16:31:58] <xerxes> TimMc: Perl effectively killed sed, awk and the UNIX philosophy. As Rob Pike says, "The days of using one tool for one job are long dead and the eulogy was written by Perl."
