[20:20:33] * xnaas coughs
[20:20:34] <xnaas> ü§™
[20:21:40] <xnaas> I despise Discord, but a few people did not make the transition from Discord ‚Üí IRC we (community I manage) did last year. Matterbridge allows me to have one channel bridged to that awful, awful platform. üòÖ
[20:22:00] <xnaas> Was thinking back on how many platforms we've hopped across over the years
[20:22:10] <xnaas> and how much simpler it all would've been to always be irc lol
[20:22:30] <xnaas> I keep meaning to add Telegram to that bridge, but muh effort.
[20:22:51] <xnaas> (I actually like Telegram as a chat application in general. It's nice and easy to convince people to convert.)
[20:23:23] <xnaas> Sure, Telegram is not the choice you should be using for verifiably private conversations, but that's what Signal is for, I guess. :P
[20:24:40] <xnaas> I saw Discord was gonna go full cryptobro üôÑ ‚Äî they claim "just kidding!" but they're obviously going to try it every several months/years until there's a small enough amount of backlash to push that shit. ü§Æ
[20:58:29] <toro> we‚Äôre a special purpose network we ban private messages and everything is in the open
[20:58:43] <toro> I joke , don‚Äôt read that; that‚Äôs between me and the internet
[20:58:53] <toro> IRCCloud puts all your chats in splunk too
[20:59:03] <toro> it‚Äôs all a privacy headache
[20:59:42] <Activ8> everything is a privacy headache, doesn't matter what playform
[20:59:45] <Activ8> platform*
[20:59:49] <toro> telegram doesn‚Äôt default to encrypted you have to close your existing non encrypted chat , click the contact amd start an encrypted chat
[21:00:02] <toro> shady if you don‚Äôt know that and assume it‚Äôs secure
[21:00:57] <toro> we banned pm so they don‚Äôt try to sell drugs or trade sex for drugs or whatever but if they do that crap on telegram and get arrested ‚Äúgood‚Äù lol
[21:01:30] <toro> I don‚Äôt read whatever pm‚Äôs we do allow
[21:01:34] <Activ8> on here there could be a log bot in logging but it doesn't tell you that on IRC.  I dare say a lot of people don't now that.  I'm not on about the lounge in general I'm on about IRC in general.
[21:01:35] <toro> but w/e
[21:01:43] <toro> yeah of course
[21:01:47] <toro> and people take screen shots etc
[21:01:53] <Activ8> exactly
[21:01:59] <toro> yeah so we warn people don‚Äôt share your real name social media job etc
[21:02:28] <toro> it‚Äôs a forum for depression like, so for tjem to talk intimate embarrassing stuff and then dox themselves is bad form
[21:03:01] <Activ8> but then again when your poorly you don't expect your info to be leaked by someone your talking too
[21:03:28] <Activ8> i.e a doctor posting on a public forum on info about their patients e.t.c
[21:03:39] <toro> I suppose , from the standpoint of, possibly someone could take advantage of a woman or worse , the fact it‚Äôs not a truly secure platform or one they‚Äôll get away with criminal activity , isn‚Äôt a bad thing
[21:03:41] <toro> But indeed
[21:03:42] <Activ8> platforms need trust
[21:05:04] <Activ8> there's a problem with VPNs at present saying they don't log then people miss use the vpn and it's logged and months later they get their door kicked in.
[21:05:28] <Activ8> Sites need transparency but how do you have transparency and trust. 
[21:06:04] <Activ8> "We won't share your data unless it's unlawful or a crime and is requested by Government/FBI" e.t.c
[21:06:41] <toro> Yeah or you‚Äôre criminally liable if someone gets sex trafficked etc
[21:06:56] <toro> fun times
[21:07:50] <Activ8> mhm yup
[21:08:08] <toro> I like blocking pm and making it another platforms problem
[21:08:11] <toro> :)
[21:08:54] <toro> forcing everything public was our answer to that. And various accusations we ‚Äúspy on‚Äù on lol
[21:08:56] <Activ8> blocking PM is fine
[21:09:02] <toro> spy on pm I mean
[21:09:24] <toro> like ok we can make this real uncomplicated and just get rid of pm
[21:10:07] <toro> telegram does reintroduce a way to pm but *shrug*
[21:10:09] <toro> SEP
[21:16:45] <xnaas> You block direct messages on your ircd, toro?
[21:17:29] <toro> Yes
[21:17:38] <xnaas> which ircd has that configurable? :O
[21:17:40] <toro> effectively force modes +RD
[21:17:47] <toro> on unrealircd
[21:17:51] <xnaas> ah, neat
[21:18:04] <toro> Anope doesn‚Äôt understand +D and needs a module patched in
[21:18:10] <xnaas> my community is small enough and most of us know where each other live and such, not a huge concern here, fortunately
[21:18:17] <toro> selectively, the bot will -RD trusted users
[21:18:21] <xnaas> but I totally understand the reasoning
[21:18:51] <xnaas> I've talked to enough people who managed large forums back when those were popular to know that...it's just not worth it
[21:19:02] <toro> things change, we‚Äôre a 20 year old community. and if it gets weird with women fighting over a guy or politics or sabotage or whatever. Irc being irc. We take pm for awhile
[21:19:04] <xnaas> therapy can only undo so much üôÉ
[21:19:09] <toro> indeed lolllll
[21:19:26] <toro> I don‚Äôt care until I get dragged into it and then it gets turned off
[21:19:35] <toro> we might be about due to turn it back on
[21:19:38] <xnaas> heh
[21:19:40] <xnaas> fair lol
[21:20:00] <xnaas> "Bicker as much as you'd like, but as soon as it affects me, fuck you" is basically my motto too :P
[21:20:10] <toro> hahaha
[21:20:16] <toro> bingo
[21:20:32] <Activ8> as long as the bickering isn't public that's been logged with violence e.t.c
[21:20:50] <toro> that‚Äôs literally the only thing anyone gets banned for predation and violence
[21:20:56] <Activ8> then again there is a duty of care on platforms required 
[21:21:09] <xnaas> we shittalk each other all day :P
[21:21:18] <Activ8> shittalking is fine if you know them
[21:21:22] <toro> I‚Äôm mostly rabidly anti censorship but that‚Äôs the line
[21:21:29] <xnaas> yeah, tight-knit, we know we're all fuckin' around ;P
[21:21:53] <xnaas> "I'll kill you" when they when a duel in chat with the bot, obviously not serious. :P
[21:22:03] <toro> irc gonna be irc no matter what network or channel hahaha
[21:22:37] <xnaas> old fat losers gonna old fat loser
[21:22:39] <xnaas> ;P
[21:22:43] <toro> hey I feel attacked
[21:22:44] <toro> Hi
[21:22:46] <toro> Jk*
[21:22:51] <xnaas> üòâ
[21:22:56] <toro> :D
[21:23:16] <Activ8> I think platforms have a massive part to play.  There needs to be solutions to these kind of issues and not taken lightly when something happens.
[21:23:16] * toro wipes the mayonnaise off of his stained AC/dc tshirt and sits up straight in his chair
[21:23:54] <xnaas> damn, too bad I'm not wearing my holy (as in, full of holes) Pink Floyd shirt that's...older than me :P
[21:24:04] <Activ8> easy way is to just outright ban but even then platforms get targeted usually
[21:24:13] <toro> well we have a couple bopm plugins that start tightening the noose on vpn, for, proxy, and eventually mobile if necessary
[21:24:25] <toro> when you get the one person you cannot get rid of or moderate
[21:24:36] <toro> some of our biggest jackasses would try 30000 hosts an hour
[21:24:44] <xnaas> sheesh
[21:24:52] <toro> they behave better now that they know they won‚Äôt get in if that‚Äôs turned on
[21:25:10] <toro> it‚Äôs stuff like that I get dragged into and asked to implement
[21:25:18] <xnaas> All I've had to "deal" with was laughing at an automated bot that failed to do anything because I block /LIST on new connections for X minutes. :P
[21:25:30] <toro> ha
[21:25:39] <toro> oh is that why networks do that
[21:25:42] <toro> For spam bots
[21:25:54] <toro> good to know
[21:26:17] <xnaas> [266]16 16 Current global users 16, max 16 ‚Äî my network's nice and small though :P
[21:26:17] <Activ8> there will always be one that causes trouble
[21:26:57] <toro> we‚Äôre single purpose one room for depression one for addicts , never had more than like 60-70 online
[21:27:06] <toro> but the intersection of drugs and the internet
[21:27:10] <toro> Sure gets amusing
[21:27:33] <xnaas> for sure
[21:27:41] <toro> aka any irc room
[21:27:42] <toro> LOL
[21:27:47] <xnaas> One of the people in our group spends like half the day posting his dab rigs and shit
[21:27:53] <toro> üò≠
[21:28:01] <xnaas> I just /collapse the images and move on. :P
[21:28:08] <Activ8> that could get messy
[21:28:49] <toro> we really don‚Äôt want to ban anyone , that is really trying to get some help or suooort
[21:29:09] <xnaas> There's only 1 person I've ever banned, but I banned them back when we were on Discord too. :P
[21:29:17] <xnaas> Homie's just too fucking stupid and I can't handle it. üòÖ
[21:29:19] <toro> there is currently an image upload feature and I could tell some stories but they might not be appropriate for this room
[21:29:22] <toro> :D
[21:29:33] <Activ8> I can safely say I have never once banned a single person from any platform
[21:29:38] <toro> ‚Äújeez Donna that thing looks like it has rabies‚Äù
[21:29:40] <Activ8> just give them a telling off and a warning
[21:29:43] <toro> pretty much is the punch line
[21:29:52] <xnaas> oh, I guess I've banned compromised accounts before too (on Discord)
[21:30:10] <xnaas> an account would randomly start posting ads or some shit after being normal for months/years and...so long! :P
[21:30:17] <toro> ahh
[21:30:48] <toro> does discord not require sms to log in ?
[21:30:56] <toro> I‚Äôve never used it
[21:31:02] <xnaas> They started forcing you to add a mobile number some time ago, iirc.
[21:31:06] <toro> ahh ok
[21:31:12] <xnaas> My account was old, though, like 2015.
[21:31:21] <Activ8> compromised accounts - that's different
[21:31:22] <toro> So old accounts could be hacked got it
[21:32:00] <xnaas> SMS is easy to spoof if you're targeting the person, but yeah, automated compromises won't get it, I suppose. :P
[21:32:49] <xnaas> Either way, I'm just glad to be off Discord.
[21:32:58] <Activ8> I can't stand discord
[21:33:03] <xnaas> Using a platform run be people who defend "cub porn" publicly is...yikes lol
[21:33:26] <xnaas> Like, you can fap to whatever drawings you want, idc, but you can't run a public service and defend that shit. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[21:34:12] <toro> Not my thing but I suppose I‚Äôve been on 4chan enough to just snicker at stuff
[21:34:30] <toro> like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just messed up daisy‚Äù
[21:35:28] <toro> we decided against discord because at the time they were hostile to groups whose purpose was not gaming
[21:35:44] <toro> perhaps that is no longer true
[21:35:45] <xnaas> Yeah, we were a gaming group since forever, so it was perfect for us back in 2015.
[21:35:46] <Activ8> there 100% has to be a line drawn what is allowed on a platform
[21:35:49] <toro> but we moved on
[21:36:11] <xnaas> I can't remember if we came to Discord from Slack or Hangouts...tough to remember the order of platform transfers anymore. :P
[21:36:41] <xnaas> Wish we'd just settled on IRC and Mumble a decade ago lol ‚Äî could've saved so much time! :P
[21:36:52] <Activ8> I went from irc to msn style like messengers but was still on irc
[21:37:18] <Activ8> I never used slack but ended up with a teams/irc combo
[21:37:32] <xnaas> We'd all met across various places: IRC, TeamSpeak, Reddit, in-game chats, etc.
[21:37:55] <Activ8> never used teamspeak or reddit platforms.  I'm no longer on social media type platforms
[21:37:59] <xnaas> hilariously, the people who were most resistant to moving to IRC were people who'd used IRC in the past lol
[21:38:08] <Activ8> which includes facebook, twitter, insta and linkedin
[21:38:42] <toro> we‚Äôve been irc for 20 years. We took a hit during ‚Äúcovid,‚Äù suddenly 1000 groups a day were doing zoom stuff , in an area where we had been only one for about 20 players
[21:39:12] <Activ8> 20 years is good going
[21:39:13] <toro> but it‚Äôs picking up again people have been doing inappropriate stuff on cam or screenshot or recording embarrassing shares
[21:39:22] <toro> and they‚Äôre running back to the anonymity of irc
[21:39:30] <Activ8> :( such a shame 
[21:39:40] <toro> heh I called that two years ago
[21:39:48] <xnaas> I've been on exactly 1 zoom call ever and I still feel disgusting.
[21:40:00] <toro> I worked in building 29 at Cisco , where webex team was. We were banned from using zoom. I don‚Äôt know why.
[21:40:08] <Activ8> don't use zoom will never use it
[21:40:09] <toro> But I still don‚Äôt use it
[21:40:12] <xnaas> (was an online D&D-esqeue thing my father wanted to do for his birthday)
[21:40:38] <toro> could be competitive concerns could be security concerns w/e they just said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù
[21:41:26] <toro> the stories I hear about the zoom trolls almost make me want to get popcorn and put it on a burner phone anyway ;)
