[00:43:38] <jholtom> blue94[m]: I use MATLAB on a regular basis
[00:43:58] <jholtom> It's a pretty excellent toolbox with a lot of bells and whistles that make life really easy
[00:44:29] <jholtom> I also write python on a pretty regular basis, but I still tend to go to MATLAB for a lot of things and fleshing out algorithms
[00:44:58] <jholtom> when I say algorithms, I mean like new algorithms and ideas, not implementation ever
[00:45:21] <blue94[m]> You have a real life job that finds matlab usefull?
[00:45:30] <blue94[m]> quite impressive
[00:46:40] <jholtom> blue94[m]: technically I'm a PhD student, but yes in the past MATLAB has been useful in my career (defense contractor designing RF frontends, lots of other people use it there too for simulating certain things), as well as a smaller startup testing algorithms before implementing in CUDA
[00:47:00] <jholtom> you should not be so quick to dismiss it as a tool with real world use....
[00:47:45] <blue94[m]> Dunno, never went to computer science undergrad

[01:07:13] <Macuser> lol blue94[m] 
[01:07:18] <Macuser> accurate. "to pass undergrad"
[01:07:57] <Macuser> let's not forget matlab has a near-identical but free twin called Octave. but even then I don't know any people in industry that use it
[01:09:07] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, "identical" only goes to a certain point. I think the special feature that make people use matlab over python aren't really something you'll find in octave either.
[01:11:08] <blue94[m]> What features?
[01:11:18] <blue94[m]> I actually spent time googling that question and didnt find answer 
[01:13:07] <sammp[m]> I may regret saying this, but recent experience has led me to realize that setting up and installing GR if you are new to the space can be particularly difficult.  Matlab has gotten much better (with easier installs over the years)... GR is still a work in-progress (improving everyday üòÅ)
[01:14:07] <jholtom> Macuser: i use octave as a direct sub for Matlab on a cluster
[01:14:13] <Macuser> nice
[01:14:25] <jholtom> Just because licensing MATLAB is a butt
[01:14:30] <funkylab[m]> blue94[m]: signal processing toolbox, simulation toolboxes, flow modelling toolbox, hardware description generation, code generation for various embedded controllers, EM analysis ...
[01:14:41] <Macuser> sammp[m] for sure.
[01:14:55] <Macuser> we use GR in my digital communications lab class in undergrad
[01:15:01] <jholtom> 5G toolbox now...Simulink has an odd place too, has some pretty interesting HLS synth tools as well
[01:15:02] <funkylab[m]> basically, Matlab does really bring a lot of "solve my industry-typical" problem toolboxes, that can be quite expensive
[01:15:05] <Macuser> most students don't like it too much. Because things are just "weird"
[01:15:22] <Macuser> but I know they would prefer it to doing the same thing in Matlab
[01:15:50] <blue94[m]> Oh wait so I can do radio straight in matlab?
[01:15:55] <Yamakaja[m]> Aren't GNU Radio and matlab really working in two different spaces?
[01:15:55] <blue94[m]> I mean it will do stuff with my SDR?
[01:16:10] <Yamakaja[m]> Except for some weird simulink integration maybe?
[01:16:18] <sammp[m]> blue94[m]: I've heard things about this... no experience myself
[01:16:20] <funkylab[m]> well the thing about matlab is that mathworks earns a lot of money through students going into industry and already knowing the tool, and as said, it does have a lot of things where it "just" solves the problem instead of you needing a domain expert engineer to code the solution themselves
[01:16:31] <funkylab[m]> obviously, I'm not a fan myself
[01:16:46] <funkylab[m]> but I see how it has its place in industry
[01:16:56] <jholtom> blue94[m]: yes it can do stuff straight with radios...but it's very bad.
[01:17:13] <blue94[m]> So I dont understand
[01:17:17] <sammp[m]> They've even started including protocol format functionality

[01:17:37] <blue94[m]> I dont get it
[01:18:04] <jholtom> It's much better at vectorizing than your general purpose language
[01:18:35] <blue94[m]> better than numpy?
[01:18:52] <funkylab[m]> depends
[01:19:00] <funkylab[m]> but I'll go with "yes.

[01:19:28] <blue94[m]> at lightspeed
[01:19:36] <Yamakaja[m]> Matlab has complete control over the language and can do stuff like cross-command optimization, numpy functions will always go back to the python interpreter
[01:20:31] <Yamakaja[m]> You can try to reduce the python overhead by using some of the weirder numpy functions / kernels (`einsum` is fun :D ), but numpy is still just a library and not the whole language

[01:21:41] <funkylab[m]> blue94[m]: the numpy array is not a native type of Python. When you write `[1 2 3 4]` in matlab, everything happening to that is treated parallelizable internally
[01:21:52] <funkylab[m]> that's the thing, Matlab is not general purpose as python
[01:22:01] <funkylab[m]> but it does do a few things well
[01:22:02] <blue94[m]> funkylab[m]: That actually sounds really good
[01:22:41] <funkylab[m]> the language is ostensibly horrible otherwise, and I don't understand how they kept that language so conservative, but it seems to have been a successful business decision
[01:23:06] <blue94[m]> Why we dont have more/better dataframes
[01:23:13] <blue94[m]> its 2021 and still no dataframes in .net
[01:23:24] <funkylab[m]> because it's a very application specific thing
[01:23:48] <funkylab[m]> and arguably, the tools to have such in other languages are OK (for example, in Python) or you can just switch to another language
[01:27:35] <blue94[m]> Matlab sounds quite nice actually, like retirement home programming
[01:27:45] <blue94[m]> I'll chose to ignore it because I hate having choice
[01:33:29] <Macuser> lol

[01:36:52] <sammp[m]> Chuck AE4CT: Didn't you say Julia was good for something?
[01:40:52] <ChuckAE4CT[m]> Julia borrows a bit from both MATLAB and Python
[01:41:46] <sammp[m]> It even mentions them specifically on they're "Getting Started" page: https://julialang.org/learning/getting-started/
[01:46:11] <sammp[m]> Hmmm... https://juliatelecom.github.io/AbstractSDRs.jl/dev/index.html
[01:48:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> Julia is the name of my GF. I do find her useful for a good many things :)
[01:49:16] <sammp[m]> jholtom looks like you were testing out using Julia with GR? https://github.com/jholtom/gr-bindjulia
[01:50:45] <muaddib[m]> I saw a neat presentation about Julia about a month ago (the coding language not the girlfriend). Am I mistaken that it shares a lot of similarities with gnu radio structure-wise in that it uses pre-compiled pieces as well as higher level bindings ?

[02:42:10] <funkylab[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "I‚Äôve often wondered how JIT..." <- honestly, confoundingly well. I mean, although our very primitive tests have not shown *that* big an improvement, Julia is supposed to get much better over iterations of code
[02:42:55] <funkylab[m]> I think there's a lot of idea exchange between languages like D which do cool profiling runs to improve compilation results, and JIT languages, which can do a lot more heuristics and be right about that

[02:53:01] <jholtom> sammp[m]: I ended somewhere realizing that Julia's embedded interpreter is not thread safe, so I'd need a fancy dispatch system to make it work in the thread per block GR land

[03:01:38] <funkylab[m]> I like that we've adopted using `using some_type = other_type` https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/master/gr-utils/modtool/templates/templates.py#L112 to reduce the number of pitfalls in in-work() casting, IO signature sizing etc
[03:03:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> blue94: ‚Äúso in hippopotamus the tangerine gravy boat?‚Äù
[03:04:06] <blue94[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: :(
[03:04:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> blue94: could you rephrase the question?
[03:05:33] <blue94[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: When we store data about frequency we only have 1 dimension - amplitude
[03:05:36] <blue94[m]> right?
[03:05:54] <funkylab[m]> um, I don't understand that sentence
[03:06:08] <funkylab[m]> "information about frequency": You mean "frequency", a real number?
[03:06:25] <blue94[m]> rf frequency
[03:06:30] <blue94[m]> instantenous rf frequency
[03:06:54] <funkylab[m]> So, we're talking about a single tone, right?
[03:07:41] <blue94[m]> For instance
[03:07:43] <blue94[m]> A signal
[03:07:43] <funkylab[m]> no, not for instance
[03:07:57] <funkylab[m]> because "instantaneous frequency" only exists for single tones
[03:08:41] <blue94[m]> it doesnt have to be sound
[03:08:43] <blue94[m]> could be light
[03:08:58] <blue94[m]> but yeah what you mean
[03:09:48] <funkylab[m]> ah "tone" is not about sound, I meant "a single harmonic oscillation" with that word, "single tone"
[03:11:12] <funkylab[m]> so, if you have a signal consisting of but a single harmonic oscillation and nothing else, you can unambiguosly say "this has frequency X"
[03:11:25] <funkylab[m]> is that what you've meant?
[03:11:35] <blue94[m]> Nooo
[03:11:48] <blue94[m]> The stream of data for instance from audio source in GR
[03:11:52] <blue94[m]> Is single dimension float array
[03:11:57] <funkylab[m]> OK
[03:11:59] <blue94[m]> it only has information about amplitude
[03:12:11] <blue94[m]> and then its streteched arbirtarily along the x axis?
[03:12:11] <blue94[m]> right?
[03:12:22] <funkylab[m]> what's the x axis?
[03:12:30] <funkylab[m]> and no, it's not stretched
[03:12:41] <blue94[m]> from 0 to the end of array
[03:13:01] <funkylab[m]> hm? I thought you were talking about a continuous source, then there's no end?
[03:13:25] <funkylab[m]> and I'm not 100% comfortable with the term "stretched", because it implies you give a sample a duration, which it has not
[03:13:47] <funkylab[m]> the sample period has a duration, the sample itself only has a discrete time
[03:13:51] <blue94[m]> funkylab[m]: No I'm taking a slice of the time
[03:14:42] <funkylab[m]> ok
[03:15:15] <funkylab[m]> so, let's just say there's one sample after the other
[03:15:23] <funkylab[m]> it's really just a sequence of numbers
[03:15:52] <funkylab[m]> it represents some amplitude in the analog world, but neither the computer nor the math it does to that sequence is aware of that
[03:16:41] <blue94[m]> funkylab[m]: Yes it does
[03:16:45] <funkylab[m]> no, it doesn't :)
[03:16:50] <blue94[m]> I can capture a single instance of that stream and plot it
[03:17:01] <blue94[m]> For isntance if I spawn signal source and plot I will have a sine wave
[03:17:15] <funkylab[m]> yes, that's you interpreting the samples as somehow connected
[03:17:34] <funkylab[m]> that's not an inherent property of a digital signal
[03:17:45] <funkylab[m]> it's really just a sequence of numbers and could "mean" anything

[04:24:34] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: I wonder if one could have the "reverse USRP architecture": instead of a common low-freq oscillator (10 MHz) from which all devices generate their LOs, sample clocks and processing clocks, distribute the LO and derive from that. For all the LO frequencies we've cared so far, fiber would have sufficient bandwidth...

[04:29:13] <jholtom> funkylab: single *concurrent* block technically.  You just need to guarantee accesses will be ordered and memory ownership doesn't get wacky....but as soon as you want to do that, you have to modify the runtime to get the interpreter setup
[04:29:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> I‚Äôm thinking something very USRP1 like for each receive channel. 8-Bit dual adc.
[04:29:37] <jholtom> Since you couldn't instantiate it as part of a block and then access from another
[04:31:00] <blue94[m]> in GR signal source when I output a signal source at the sample rate equal to my audio sink sample rate I will hear the sound of the specified frequency?
[04:31:14] <blue94[m]> How accurate is that because Im hearing up to till 21kHZ which should not be possible
[04:31:31] <blue94[m]> Im losing my trust in signal source
[04:34:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> What is your audio sample rate?
[04:34:20] <blue94[m]> 441kHz
[04:34:30] <blue94[m]> 44.1kHz
[04:35:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> Chuck a frequency sink just before your audio sink.
[04:35:34] <blue94[m]> yeah it shows the same
[04:35:44] <blue94[m]> but it makes sense since bandwidth comes from sampel rate..
[04:35:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> The audio hardware itself may not be faithful up near nyqust.
[04:36:10] <jholtom> funkylab: oh also with the Julia thing, it's grossly inefficient because I have to box up data types to safely use them in Julia because of metadata
[04:36:44] <jholtom> So I get into double allocation and copying stuff around :(
[04:37:23] <blue94[m]> jholtom: Yeah but I'd expect it to play less rather than more frequencies?
[04:39:03] <funkylab[m]> jholtom: It's still pretty cool! 
[04:41:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> blue94: the phase accumulator becomes less accurate as the desired frequency approaches nyquist.
[04:41:23] <blue94[m]> wow that really sucks
[04:41:24] <funkylab[m]> I had a really short exchange with one of the devs behind pydata's parallelism stuff, and one of the takeaways was that for python blocks in GR, it might simply be worth spawing one python interpreter per block from the C++ runtime
[04:41:26] <blue94[m]> how to tune this?

[04:42:23] <jholtom> funkylab: yeah that's what we'd have to do for Julia sorta.  But Julia is already really good at parallelization so it almost stinks to have to do
[04:42:33] <jholtom> It's just the embedding that's not thread safe at all
[04:42:40] <funkylab[m]> hmm
[04:43:04] <jholtom> funkylab: that's cool to hear though. Would be an interesting experiment to do with the python/c++ runtime

[04:47:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> blue94: I just ran a *simulation* at 44.1kHz with a 21kHz complex signal.  The main artifacts are at least 90dB below the main signal at 21kHz.  But if you think about it, there's only 2.1 samples per period at 21kHz.  Yes, it satisfies nyquist, but without some filtering, it'll be a bit rough.
[04:49:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> You could have the line input connected to an audio input at the same sample rate and see if there are any extra artifacts due to the sound hardware.
[04:49:48] <blue94[m]> woah thats surprising
[04:49:54] <blue94[m]> I thought its just a long sine wave
[04:49:56] <blue94[m]> why its broken?
[04:49:58] <funkylab[m]> no, that's not surprising!
[04:50:01] <funkylab[m]> it's not broken!
[04:50:35] <funkylab[m]> it's just how the math is, and 90 dB suppression of artifact means the math works to a high degree of precision when it comes to the calculations
[04:50:50] <funkylab[m]> that's really good news :)
[04:50:56] * patchvonbraun[m] drops a brick on my toe, it hurts.  Decides physics is broken.
[04:51:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> In real world hardware we almost never exceed 80% of nyquist.
[04:51:57] <funkylab[m]> blue94[m]: again, no, within your PC it's really just a sequence of numbers, and the job of converting it to a continuous-time sine wave is what the DAC in the sound card does, **together** with an analog reconstruction filter
[04:52:21] <funkylab[m]> and that filter is probably the least "perfect" thing in this whole chain
[04:52:27] <jholtom> funkylab: üëç thanks

[08:01:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> You may find that putting an FM-band filter (NOT a notch, or trap, but an FM bandpass) will improve your sensitivity.   Car radios in particular, have historically been very very good receivers in the sensitivity realm, because that have tracking filters in them that only present a few hundred kHz to the downstream components.   You'll need to give the RTL-SDR a bit of help to match that performance.

[08:05:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> If your RTL-SDR front-end doesn't have to cope with all manner of out-of-band "stuff", it improves sensitivity.

[08:07:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> Amplifier may or may not help--in many cases, it makes things worse because all that out-of-band stuff is now ALSO amplified.  If you already have the amp, then antenna/amp/filter/rtl-sdr.
[08:07:55] <maxtim> I remember glancing over 'sensitivity' when I was looking into a diy amplifier. I think I have an understanding of what that means, but I'm not super confident
[08:08:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> Sensitivity issues in VHF are very often due to inadequate front-end filtering, rather than insufficient low-noise gain.  The front-end of the RTL-SDR is already fairly low-noise.
[08:08:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's about signal-to-noise ratio.  If that ratio is too low, your sensitivity (the ability to discern and demodualte weak signals) is crappier.
[08:09:39] <maxtim> interesting
[08:10:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also what kind of cabling do you have between your window-mounted dipole, and the RTL-SDR?
[08:10:41] <maxtim> sma coax
[08:11:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> Really skinny stuff?  How long?
[08:11:25] <maxtim> it's rather thin, came with the dipole. Short, I'd say about six inches
[08:11:45] <maxtim> I doubt it has proper shielding
[08:11:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, so I'd look into a filter first, before an amplifier.
[08:12:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> There are plenty of skinny coaxes out there that are more-than-adequately shielded.  But generally, the smaller the coax, the higher the loss/meter.  Since this is VHF, and it's only 15cm long, loss is not a big deal.
[08:12:44] <maxtim> I tried a trap at one point, which is why I thought about an amplifier this time
[08:13:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> A FM trap eliminates the FM band.  That's not what you want for this particular application.
[08:13:44] <maxtim> it was a vhf trap. very likely not what I was looking for
[08:16:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> bandpass == lets that band through  bandstop/trap == blocks that band
[08:17:17] <maxtim> that feels like a 'duh' thing that I should've realized earlier...
[08:18:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> The problem with the low end of VHF is that it's *crowded*, and there's plenty of strong signals.  Which means that wide-band front-ends, such as in MANY sdrs, will need some help in keep out too much "crap".
[08:23:16] <maxtim> http://electronics-diy.com/electronic_schematic.php?id=803
[08:23:37] <maxtim> So it's just some caps to drain and some inductors?

[20:13:08] <blue94[m]> Perhaps I should close and re-open the socket

[20:22:13] <funkylab[m]> stop right there
[20:22:39] <blue94[m]> And I want to display it exactly the same in Time Sink
[20:22:41] <funkylab[m]> can you please go back to the point where you're explaining what you're solving, I might have missed that
[20:22:57] <blue94[m]> I want to stream that signal to GR and have it look identical in Time Sink
[20:23:16] <blue94[m]> but its scrolling

[20:24:38] <funkylab[m]> so, well, it seems you're not setting the number of samples that the time sink is displaying identical to the length of the signal you're repeatedly sending (I infer that you're repeatedly sending it, you didn't say that)
[20:24:51] <blue94[m]> Exactly! Thats what I think
[20:25:03] <funkylab[m]> so, what is the length, and what did you set

[20:25:09] <blue94[m]> samplerate/2
[20:25:16] <funkylab[m]> in number?
[20:25:27] <blue94[m]> 22,050
[20:25:52] <funkylab[m]> ok, so you've set this number in the time sink?
[20:26:14] <blue94[m]> Uh no, I set the double of that..
[20:26:24] <funkylab[m]> doesn't look like it.
[20:26:54] <funkylab[m]> the flowgraph picture you sent literally says 1024.
[20:27:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> You set number of points to 1024, which is the default.  Without a trigger setting, it'll scroll.  Gnu Radio is a continous-stream system and the Time Sink acts a lot like an oscilloscope, which would behave almost exactly the same as what you're seeing.
[20:28:30] <muaddib[m]> Hash: I started using I3 about six months ago and it‚Äôs amazing. I thought it was going to be a steep learning curve and I would have to relearn how to do everything, but what I found was that it was an almost natural process for me as I already use so many keyboard shortcuts. Was that similar to your experience?
[20:29:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: I use MATE, and the WM that comes with it.  It behaves very much like the WM/Desktop systems I've used for a couple of decades, and that's fine with me :)
[20:30:20] <Hash[m]> muaddib[m]: Literally installed it yesterday so still learning the shortcuts and how to operate but it definitely feels more organized. Also have the Arch linux learning curve so still in Ubuntu on main machine while I get up to speed on the laptop I installed it on :) 
[20:30:24] <blue94[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Oooh, you're talking smart things
[20:30:30] <blue94[m]> And I reckong the same applies to frequency sink
[20:30:34] <blue94[m]> ?
[20:31:24] <funkylab[m]> blue94[m]: don't know how to interpret that question!
[20:31:32] <Hash[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: I saw how fast Yamakaja navigated his system and felt like a turtle ;)
[20:31:34] <funkylab[m]> You mean the FFT size, I guess?
[20:31:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> bbl.  I gotta go be productive with the soldering iron for a while.
[20:32:01] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun: godspeed!
[20:32:24] <blue94[m]> enjoy
[20:34:56] <Hash[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Share pics after you're done!
[20:38:27] <muaddib[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "muaddib: I use MATE, and the..." <- I‚Äôm unfamiliar with MATE. Should I check it out?
[20:42:10] <blue94[m]> sooooo.
[20:42:20] <blue94[m]> Any1 has good idea what to do so my frequency sink looks like this?

[20:42:57] <Yamakaja[m]> blue94: Which operation does the frequency sink apply internally?
[20:43:07] <blue94[m]> IFFT
[20:43:12] <Yamakaja[m]> An FFT
[20:43:20] <blue94[m]> yes FFT
[20:43:27] <Yamakaja[m]> What's the inverse of the FFT? The IFFT
[20:43:51] <blue94[m]> I send it the IFFT of that shape
[20:43:57] <Yamakaja[m]> So take the output you want to achieve, apply the IFFT, feed it into the frequency sink, get the alignment correct and there you go. But the real question should be: Why? :D
[20:43:58] <blue94[m]> but I dont get it back
[20:44:12] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I did but I only get two peaks
[20:44:27] <Yamakaja[m]> How long was your original signal, and what was the fft size?
[20:44:40] <blue94[m]> Say the picture of my square freq spans from 5kHz to 7 kHz - I will get peaks at 5 and 7
[20:44:52] <Yamakaja[m]> FFT size on the input and output should be the same for optimal results
[20:45:07] <Yamakaja[m]> s/input/IFFT/, s/output/FFT/
[20:45:26] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Lets try that
[20:45:28] <blue94[m]> Thanks

[20:52:48] <blue94[m]> Okay we're getting somewhere
[20:53:19] <Yamakaja[m]> Why does that look like you're working with a real signal?
[20:53:34] <Yamakaja[m]> (As in "not complex")
[20:54:26] <blue94[m]> yeah because its real
[20:55:04] <Yamakaja[m]> Could you please show us the code that you're using to perform the FFT and send the output to GR? (I.e. the C# code)

[20:56:52] <muaddib[m]> Hash: where did you see Yamakaja navigate his system?
[20:58:00] <Yamakaja[m]> Uh, i gave him a small demo of something i don't want to talk about publicly yet :p
[21:01:53] <Yamakaja[m]> blue94: A screenshot of your flowgraph please?

[21:02:37] <muaddib[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I‚Äôd be into a demo of you navigating your system, haha. Now that I‚Äôm intrigued. 
[21:02:46] <Hash[m]> muaddib: I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some good YouTube vids as well, but that was my first time seeing it
[21:03:30] <Yamakaja[m]> Yeah, just google people using i3, it's pretty much how most people use it
[21:05:20] <Yamakaja[m]> For optimal performance you need to develop a stategy to managing your different workspaces. For example i always keep certain windows in their dedicated workspace, which allows me to navigate to those pretty much by muscle memory
[21:08:57] <muaddib[m]> Agreed. I‚Äôm pretty proud of my initial effort at my boot up config. Launches my IDE‚Äôs, web browser, sources pybombs environments and makes a tiled terminal workspace. 
[21:08:57] <muaddib[m]> I also added some custom commands to throw workspaces to the right or left monitor. 
[21:10:32] <Yamakaja[m]> If you've already been using i3 i don't think i can show you anything particularly impressive. My setup might even be more vanilla than yours ... i think Hash was just impressed because it was his first contact with i3 xD
[21:12:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> Back in my day, if you wanted multiple tiled windows, you stacked serial terminals around your physical desk :) :)
[21:12:50] <muaddib[m]> Gotcha. 
[21:12:51] <muaddib[m]> My first foray into that world was tmux, which has its uses for sure particularly for starting up processes on remote systems, leaving and coming later to check on them. But the command set was way more work than it was worth for my local machine. 
[21:13:10] <muaddib[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: Bwahahahah. I do that too!
[21:13:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> I haven't owned a serial terminal in probably 30 years :)
[21:14:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> In the 1980s, the packet-working-group of the local radio club made money selling surplus Volker-Craig terminals.  We had a bunch of them.
[21:15:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> 'Course, then we made the (in)famous "PI" card.  Made a crap-tonne selling those back in the day.

[21:17:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> Packet-interface card for "high speed" RF modems like the WA4DSY modem that was a "thing" back then.  Synchronous serial interface--originally PC/AT bus, and then we did a PCI bus version.  There are still kernel drivers for it...
[21:18:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> First prototype was made in the PCB lab at the Communications Research Center in Ottawa, and then production was moved to a (now defunct) company called MegaDawn.  We stuffed and tested them ourselves--all through-hole components back then.
