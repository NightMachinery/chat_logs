[16:06:08] <digitok> where are you using the regex
[16:06:37] <re101-quail-85> python
[16:07:25] <digitok> you can use result.group(1)

[18:49:48] <mike18> hi how can i create a regex to split into tokens separated by comma and the first token to be Foo or Bar? i tried: "(Foo|Bar)[ ]+"
[18:56:01] <purplex> whats the string looks like? guess [ ]+ might be the culprit 
[18:57:00] <mike18> example: https://wandbox.org/permlink/FU8Wo4yfVda1EmVy
[18:57:20] <mike18> i know with [ ]+ i can split it into tokens
[18:57:32] <mike18> but is there a way to tell the regex the first token needs to be Foo or Bar?
[18:59:00] <OnlineCop> Will Foo/Bar contain spaces after it?
[18:59:14] <purplex> he added | before [ ]+ in code
[19:00:55] <mike18> yes they do
[19:01:34] <mike18> so im not sure how to write that in regex
[19:02:35] *** Quits: luva (~luva@45.141.152.62) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[19:02:38] <OnlineCop> By default, std::regex uses ECMAScript syntax. But when I'm using `(?<=^Foo|^Bar)[ ]+|[ ]+` it's throwing a zero-width assertion error on me.
[19:03:21] *** Joins: luva (~luva@45.141.152.52)
[19:03:53] <OnlineCop> https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/ doesn't mention (?< however...
[19:04:08] <OnlineCop> And ECMAscript doesn't support \K ...
[19:04:20] <mike18> oh

[19:05:02] <OnlineCop> My initial thought would be to capture `^(Foo|Bar)[ ]+|[ ]+` and simply replace it with $1. That would replace it with "nothing" in the latter portion, and replace the captured Foo or Bar if it existed.

[19:11:27] <purplex> i thought it used boost
[19:12:54] <purplex> hm but i can use \K in std::regex 
[19:13:14] <OnlineCop> @mike18: What if you add in `std::smatch` and pass that in as a 2nd parameter to regex_search? https://wandbox.org/permlink/4t1mQgodYjlzNzE2
[19:14:25] <OnlineCop> During the first iteration, `^Foo ` or `^Bar ` (note the trailing space) is the 1st element of the `m` match.
[19:14:30] <mike18> ok but how can i still get the Foo and bar as token in sregex_token_iterator ?
[19:15:18] <mike18> or thats what you use smatch for?
[19:21:11] <OnlineCop> It looks like regex_token_iterator is essentially the .split() command in other languages: the value within .split() is discarded and only everything else is left.
[19:21:51] <OnlineCop> So matching `[ ]+` will print 'Foo' or 'Bar' at the beginning, but if you include the text Foo/Bar, then that is part of the .split() "delimiter" and it gets discarded.
[19:22:21] <mike18> you mean add m.str(1) ?
[19:22:25] <OnlineCop> I guess you could then check whether s.begin() equals either of Foo or Bar and do logic based on that.
[19:22:45] <mike18> and just use [ ]+ ?
[19:22:58] <OnlineCop> Right: https://wandbox.org/permlink/gqC1UbPoFl1Yr53X
[19:23:10] <mike18> maybe thatn no regex is needed at all ol
[19:23:11] <mike18> lol
[19:23:33] <mike18> or you see regex beeing helpful than?
[19:23:43] <OnlineCop> A lot of the examples are using std::copy with sregex_token_iterator.
[19:24:32] <OnlineCop> It would be helpful if you want to use it as a .split() delimiter, if you have some complicated "match this OR this weird edge case OR this other edge case..."
[19:24:37] <OnlineCop> But probably not otherwise.
[19:24:42] <purplex> you can try #include <boost/regex.hpp> for cool features
[19:25:05] <OnlineCop> Yeah; boost's regex is going to be more PCRE-compliant, so have a lot more bells-and-whistles.
