[09:21:15] <MohdAariz[m]> open source and free software is better than pycharm in all cases Lol
[09:23:36] <Arya[m]> neovim and emacs has lsp
[09:23:49] <Arya[m]> just use pycharm CE if you really want pycharm
[09:24:00] <Arya[m]> ig you can run cracked pycharm via wine 
[09:30:50] <gtlsgamr> 11:29  mysticbtw[ │  [08:43:41] I prefer rss ))<--- But even for that we need some sources right?
[09:31:32] <pystardust> I most blogy websites are made with static site gens which support rss
[09:31:37] <gtlsgamr> yes
[09:31:49] <pystardust> morning gtlsgamr
[09:32:54] <gtlsgamr> morning pystardust 
[09:33:23] <gtlsgamr> what are you doing pystardust?
[09:34:40] <pystardust> classes fam
[09:39:10] <Arya[m]> <pystardust> "I most blogy websites are made..." <- yeah rss is pretty cool
[09:40:47] <gtlsgamr> Guys I really want to work on this
[09:40:54] <gtlsgamr> is anyone willing to start it up?
[09:41:49] <gtlsgamr> with me?
[09:42:15] <Arya[m]123> start up what
[09:42:18] <Arya[m]123> gli?
[09:42:49] <gtlsgamr> gli is okay i mean if we get donations we can keep it up
[09:42:53] <gtlsgamr> but other than that
[09:43:01] <gtlsgamr> i am talking about this text blog thing
[09:43:13] <Arya[m]123> we aldready have a text blog right
[09:43:23] <Arya[m]123> you mean linking to resources?
[09:44:09] <gtlsgamr> Yes something like this > https://hitarththummar.xyz/posts/blog/interesting_links.html
[09:44:15] <gtlsgamr> we need to actively work on it
[09:45:27] <Arya[m]123> yeah 
[09:45:44] <Arya[m]123> if any of us find cool links share here and we will add it to gli
[09:46:54] <gtlsgamr> copy my page and add to gli
[09:47:45] <NightFury[m]> Arya[m]123: Yeah ok
[09:48:31] <gtlsgamr> here https://git.hitarththummar.xyz/htxyz/plain/posts/blog/interesting_links.md?h=main
[09:56:08] <Arya[m]123> pystardust: you renewed it?
[09:59:30] <pystardust> Arya[m]123: Expires: 2022-03-01 xd
[09:59:39] <pystardust> linode gives 60 days 
[09:59:45] <Arya[m]123> oh 
[09:59:53] <Arya[m]123> lmao
[10:00:01] <Arya[m]123> why use cringe american date format
[10:01:17] <gtlsgamr> It is not american
[10:02:45] <gtlsgamr> ISO 8601 tackles this uncertainty by setting out an internationally agreed way to represent dates:
[10:02:48] <gtlsgamr> YYYY-MM-DD
[10:02:51] <gtlsgamr> For example, September 27, 2012 is represented as 2012-09-27.
[10:03:09] <Arya[m]123> europe india and most of the world uses DD-MM-YYYY
[10:03:41] <pystardust> Arya[m]123 is the cringe one here not the date
[10:04:08] <pystardust> that date format is the best, it orders itself and i think everyone who writes in plain text knows that
[10:04:40] <Arya[m]123> i write in plain text nowadays
[10:04:55] <NightFury[m]> In resources https://linuxjourney.com/
[10:04:59] <Arya[m]123> because my emacs config is broke
[10:05:01] <Arya[m]123> n
[10:05:21] <pystardust> btw that date expiration is wrong, apprantly its a bug in linode, the expiration is 60 days from start and we started it on 2021-12-02, so the expiration will be this month end
[10:05:29] <NightFury[m]> And for little fun stuff https://distrotest.net/index.php
[10:06:03] <pystardust> gtlsgamr: bro I think only a website is good enough for gli na?
[10:06:14] <NightFury[m]> Hey gtlsgamer can you add this
[10:06:26] <Arya[m]123> man linuxjourney is a great resource
[10:06:29] <Arya[m]123> pystardust: yeah
[10:06:41] <Arya[m]123> for now it is good enough
[10:06:50] <pystardust> ill transfer the site to my vps soon
[10:07:27] <NightFury[m]> Arya[m]123: also he can add one fun section for and in that distrotest website link
[10:07:47] <Arya[m]123> for talking we can just use your mumble or somethin
[10:08:03] <Arya[m]123> what else do we host other than git,email and mumble
[10:09:30] <Tor[m]> <pystardust> "Arya: Expires: 2022-03-01 xd" <- Isn't this something that wreaked havoc on microsoft 
[10:09:38] <Tor[m]> 22 crisis
[10:09:42] <Arya[m]123> y2k2?
[10:09:52] <Arya[m]123> *y2k22
[10:10:17] <Tor[m]> Ha bhul gaya naam
[10:10:34] <Arya[m]123> https://news.itsfoss.com/y2k22-bug/
[10:11:38] <NightFury[m]> He do you know how do @for matrix guys from telegram
[10:11:46] <Arya[m]123> you can
[10:11:47] <Arya[m]123> t
[10:11:53] <Arya[m]123> you just have to type their name 
[10:12:05] <Arya[m]123> which then pings them
[10:12:42] <NightFury[m]> @AryaSucks2021
[10:13:08] <NightFury[m]> Arya[m]123: Ok got it
[10:16:15] <M404[m]> <Arya[m]> "neovim and emacs has lsp" <- I know and i love those , but pycharm comes with lots of features pre enabled and I'm tired of dealing with configuring and detailing my config files. Now  i just need to get my work done
[10:17:29] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: yes you are right only a website is good enough
[10:18:13] <Arya[m]123> <Arya[m]> "ig you can run cracked pycharm..." <- .
[10:18:47] <gtlsgamr> 12:09      Tor[m] │  <pystardust> "Arya: Expires: 2022-03-01 xd" <- Isn't this something that wr..... )) <-- no that was a programming error. they were storing dates in integer formats.
[10:20:12] <Arya[m]123> tried i3 but back in sway
[10:20:42] <NightFury[m]> gtlsgamr: @gtlsgamr I shared some links please check.
[10:22:03] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: But if the dates were kept like mm-dd-yyyy ( in integers) problem won't have occurred
[10:23:14] <gtlsgamr> Tor[m]: The dates were not kept in YYYY-MM-DD like iSO. They were kept in YYYYMMDD that was the issue.
[10:23:46] <gtlsgamr> YYYY-MM-DD is not integer. It is date datatype. 
[10:23:54] <gtlsgamr> NightFury[m]: yes looking at those right now
[10:25:28] <NightFury[m]> gtlsgamr: Yeah the second one link you can make a section called fun section and add if possible it's pretty good.
[10:28:15] <gtlsgamr> https://www.gnulinuxindia.org/blog/resources/
[10:31:34] <NightFury[m]> gtlsgamr: Cool

[18:26:31] <jerrymuscles[m]> i use logseq for journaling and note-taking too
[18:26:31] <jerrymuscles[m]> you know, the note connecting thing
[18:26:32] <jerrymuscles[m]> supports flashcards and stuff
[18:26:42] <NightFury[m]> > <jerrymuscles> proprietary
[18:26:42] <NightFury[m]> > well, logseq is a good option:
[18:26:42] <NightFury[m]> > https://logseq.com
[18:26:42] <NightFury[m]> Will give it a try surely
[18:26:50] <jerrymuscles[m]> JB[m]: glad you find it useful
[18:26:55] <jerrymuscles[m]> NightFury[m]: cool
[18:29:38] <NeoVoid[m]> <JB[m]> "i wanna switch from vim to a..." <- joplin is your best bet.
[18:31:43] <NeoVoid[m]> a note taking app is useless if it cant track habit.
[18:31:56] <NeoVoid[m]> i am not sure if joplin can do that.
[18:32:13] <NeoVoid[m]> but anyone knows something like this plz let me know
[18:32:23] <JB[m]> yea
[18:32:23] <JB[m]> PLUS i dont want my notes to be locked into  a propitiatory ecosystem/extension
[18:32:23] <JB[m]> For ease of exporting in future  to another application
[18:32:31] <JB[m]> NeoVoid[m]: wdym
[18:34:08] <NeoVoid[m]> JB[m]: i mean to track my habit. Like attending a class everyday. and it will track record of all the time when i check it. and tell me the summary.
[18:34:44] <NeoVoid[m]> so i can tick this task i dont these many days.
[18:34:53] <NeoVoid[m]> like that.
[18:35:53] <JB[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Interesting...
[18:36:53] <JB[m]> I use calendar for blocking time 
[18:36:53] <JB[m]> And For Habits i use a different app
[18:37:09] <NeoVoid[m]> that should be the foremost main feature of any note taking app otherwise i could just write todo list in any simple text editor.
[18:37:24] <NightFury[m]> Tick tick is also good for tracking habits but I tried before in windows
[18:38:45] <JB[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Ok, i get it. I'll suggest you stop using to-do list and use calendar instead.
[18:38:45] <JB[m]> And By Note taking i meant having  a Knowledge base (Basically Study NOtes)

[18:44:00] <jerrymuscles[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "i mean to track my habit. Like..." <- that's some smart-ass thang, i'd say
[18:45:17] <NeoVoid[m]> luckily in emacs org-habits covers that.
[18:45:17] <NeoVoid[m]> and in f-droid i found "Did i?" app. but it has only 5 habits limit.
[18:45:17] <NeoVoid[m]> For taking knowledge base notes i preferes a real life notepad made of paper.
[18:45:17] <NeoVoid[m]> but sometime i do store them in vimwiki and emacs org page.

[18:46:14] <NeoVoid[m]> > And By Note taking i meant having  a Knowledge base (Basically Study NOtes)
[18:46:14] <NeoVoid[m]> calender would be a mess unless if you didnt meant paper made one.
[18:46:28] <smud[m]> I dove into the whole knowledge management rabbit hole last year, there is sooo much to look at
[18:46:36] <NeoVoid[m]> but habit also help you to track birthdays.
[18:46:53] <NeoVoid[m]> smud[m]: whats that
[18:46:54] <smud[m]> zettelkasten, second brain, wikis, all that

[20:17:38] <jerrymuscles[m]> care to elaborate?
[20:19:03] <jerrymuscles[m]> <M404[m]> "nmtui is buggy for me , any..." <- tbh, no
[20:19:04] <jerrymuscles[m]> i tried living with connman
[20:19:04] <jerrymuscles[m]> so, set up my own scripts
[20:19:04] <jerrymuscles[m]> until i switched to ol' reliable networkmanager for the sake of my sanity
[20:19:26] <jerrymuscles[m]> <M404[m]> "nmtui is buggy for me , any..." <- nm-applet, maybe?
[20:20:56] <M404[m]> > <jerrymuscles> buggy?
[20:20:56] <M404[m]> > care to elaborate?
[20:20:56] <M404[m]> it doesnt show the available wifi connections properly , need to open and close it few times inorder to work properly. but on reboot it autoconnects to the previously connected wifi device.
[20:21:24] <M404[m]> i kinda felt it buggy
[20:22:29] <M404[m]> jerrymuscles[m]: tried that aswell , but the connection establishment taking some time
[20:22:40] <M404[m]> or is it common ?>
[20:22:50] <smud[m]> M404[m]: Looks like a driver issue maybe
[20:23:20] <jerrymuscles[m]> M404[m]: i have experienced this once or twice, i think
[20:23:20] <jerrymuscles[m]> but a no-brainer
[20:23:38] <jerrymuscles[m]> M404[m]: i dunno if connman or iw has a gui frontend
[20:23:38] <jerrymuscles[m]> lemme check
[20:24:19] <JB[m]> M404[m]: Maybe its ur wifi card
[20:24:19] <JB[m]> Faced this issue on another distro or hardware ?
[20:25:13] <jerrymuscles[m]> M404[m]: btw, which distro?
