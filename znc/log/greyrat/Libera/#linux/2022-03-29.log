[00:54:11] <tilt> msiism: in the tcl shop, we had one task. once in a while it would turn out that the 180 _manual_ text processors next door did a repetitive job. then we would extend pre- and postprocessing to reduce that work

[01:42:41] <Mathisen> i remember that

[01:43:28] <Sauvin> I dont' check sums, either, but I'm fairly paranoid and don't run .sh installers unless I'm VERY confident about where I downloaded it from.

[01:44:00] <NyB> msiism: the question is how you get a reliable hash kinda out of band. If it's a question of e.g. a specific mirror being compromised, then OK. But if it's e.g. the main GitHub project, well...

[02:55:05] <cluelessperson> blackop, so, the expectation is for you to  create a "virtual environment" directory for python packages to exist for a project, to avoid clashing with each other and to be maintainable

[03:11:49] <Sauvin> blackop, so now you know how to make shell scripts about the same way I do. A script is just a bunch of canned command lines shoveled into a file, at least, that's what they are for me.
[03:11:59] <Sauvin> For more serious work, I tend not to use shell scripting. O:)
[03:12:39] <Sauvin> So, instead of issuing a series of commands at the command line, you just issue _one_, and that one causes all the commands you canned in that file to execute.

[07:46:08] <sudomann> I'm in this position due to client specifications, and basically some remote engineers need a desktop environment to work with client data

[07:48:18] <sudomann> The theory in my mind was that the desktop environment could be rendered to a virtual video driver, and you can see this by connecting to a server. I dont know how click, drag, text input, would be transmitted, but thats how i landed at VNC.
[07:48:59] <ayecee> that is indeed what xvnc does.

[07:51:07] <ayecee> i'm sure the security engineer would much rather you use a vpn
[07:51:24] <ayecee> and maybe use xvnc or xrdp over that
[07:51:24] <rascul> pnbeast i wouldn't make it past the first beer
[07:51:34] <rbox> pnbeast: lol
[07:51:44] <ayecee> but the security engineer probably won't want to punch a hole for that either
[07:52:13] <sudomann> We have that - The client stipulation is: our data does not leave US servers. So my setup:, engineer must connect to our vpn, from which they will be able to log into this remote desktop thing and work with client data
[07:52:21] <ayecee> a lot of a security engineer's job is telling people they can't do that

[08:56:06] <ayecee> i kinda feel like there's a separate cause here and the swap thing is just a symptom
[08:56:13] <twainwek> it's possible
[08:56:37] <ayecee> more than possible. like you said, this isn't normal swap behavior.

I know about ansible but that needs lot of work to get it working in an env and customize it. Do you recomend any other  tools ? Goal is to centrally patch and monitor my linux servers AND GET some visibiliy on what packages are installed, what needs to be installed, give permissiosn to certain users etc.

[11:21:46] <mlu> there's no standard for this type of stuff: interfaces and software are all over the place
[11:21:52] <spyroboy> the big companies use 1 distro and they use 1 image for their whole fleet.
[11:21:53] <wyclif> they automate all the things as much as possible
[11:22:04] <spyroboy> if they detect a problem, they update the image and redeploy the fleet.
[11:22:09] <mlu> if you standardized on a distro like RHEL, then maybe a solution is possible, but it'd be very distro and software specific
[11:22:30] <wyclif> mlu: a lot of companies like RHEL for that reason

[11:23:06] <milesrout> i see
[11:23:21] <mlu> if you want a big control panel where you can just monitor and admin all your individual systems and also don't want to do much work: yeah -- MS has a solution for that, and with WSL, your Linux stuff runs there too
[11:23:46] <spyroboy> I doubt the control plane will manage the WSL stuff.
[11:24:07] <mlu> there are security channels for Ubuntu LTS, RHEL, etc. -- but if you talk Linux in general -- no such thing
[11:24:15] <milesrout> i think what mlu is saying is a load of rubbish. loads of people have large numbers of linux systems that they administer centrally.

[11:26:09] <spyroboy> there's a catch 22 in that the larger you get the more likely you'll have developed some internal system for tracking these things
[11:26:15] <mlu> i.e. is there a source of truth for what's installed on your system? generally speaking, no -- even if your distro provides a package manager, it is often possible to install stuff outside those package managers
[11:26:21] <spyroboy> but as you get even larger, you'll just shift focus to treating your fleet as cattle.

[11:28:18] <spyroboy> I've managed 400+ instances with Ansible. we installed a lot of packages through the package manager but some software doesn't have a tidy package so you install them, with Ansible, otherwise.

[11:43:33] <spyroboy> mlu, lol it's pretty unclear what he's done up until now. he said 'not yet tried to remove it' just 'tried manually deleting it'
[11:43:49] <Descartes> It tried to write the entire tar ball which should have been about 160 GB, but ran out of space
[11:44:03] <mlu> a sticky situation
[11:44:06] <spyroboy> the command should have exited and either left behind the tar or deleted it.
[11:44:16] <spyroboy> did you delete it?
[11:44:22] <spyroboy> what command did you use to delete it?
[11:44:26] <spyroboy> what did the command report?
[11:44:27] <Affliction> is the file still visible?
[11:44:41] <Descartes> The file system is in a 40 GB drive, and it just tried to write a 160 GB tar file into that drive and ended up only using about 20 GB of space
[11:44:49] <spyroboy> additional questions: is the tar process still running?
[11:45:07] <Descartes> so now the file systemm is compltely full

[16:07:29] <Gustavo6046> I want to "flatten" those peaks (kind of like running a hard clip distortion/limiter on audio, if you get the visual analogy) – so that while the process in the dockerfile feels hard at work, the system itself keeps up the smooth sailing.

[18:45:52] <koollman> and is generally easier to script than directly using the sftp command, but that is quite subjective
[18:46:07] <NeoFAT32> peetaur... Yeah because I found out we can use native ftp command from command prompt/terminal.
[18:46:21] <NeoFAT32> No need to install Filezilla or such a third-party programs.
[18:46:43] <koollman> NeoFAT32: that is also true for sftp
[18:46:49] <NeoFAT32> So on a system running which supposed to be limited by its perm to install non-native Windows programs, it's pretty cool.
[18:47:06] <peetaur> and whenever I need to connect...I ask for rsync :)

[18:47:20] <NeoFAT32> Yeah. I was thinking about running an OS the more natively possible.
[18:47:30] <Gustavo6046> sftp + ftps = ???
[18:47:31] <peetaur> sftp's purpose is to be like ftp ....but why would you want to be like ftp?
[18:47:33] <Gustavo6046> sftps lol
[18:47:43] <peetaur> Gustavo6046: sftp is ssh, not ftp or ftps
[18:47:49] <Gustavo6046> i know
[18:47:59] <NeoFAT32> Yeah it's cool but it's not native.
[18:47:59] <Gustavo6046> peetaur, i assume that it's for people who have reasons to use ftp to begin with
[18:48:01] <Gustavo6046> whatever they might be
[18:48:12] <peetaur> so you could sftp + ssl if you feel like it, but adding another file protocol in there makes no sense
[18:48:18] <NeoFAT32> I'm talking about the fact you're using rsync.
[18:48:19] <Gustavo6046> for example it is useful if you're behind a NAT
[18:48:27] <Gustavo6046> CGNAT* even
[18:48:29] <Gustavo6046> because you could simply use a TCP tunnel

[22:07:16] <peetaur> wonderer: with sort, you use eg. -k2,2n to sort a normal number (like 123232) in field 2, or -V for fancy stuff (it's meant for versions like 1.2.34), and eg. awk '{print $3}' prints field 3 so field 2 is gone. But not sure how to get a size properly with find...eg. du and ls will give you human readable ...but it's not a proper formatting thing like printf and stat

[23:37:30] <Khaytsus> Welp
[23:37:31] <immibis> twainwek: nslookup goes directly to DNS

[23:38:05] <twainwek> :(
[23:38:10] <BCMM> twainwek: the disparity is because nslookup specifically does a DNS lookup, which isn't always how something like ping or curl gets an address. you can use use `getent ahosts` to debug NSS resolution
[23:38:22] <dTal> you just have to be careful not to use ".local" for anything else...

[23:42:02] <bls> You need to use .local with MDNS AFAIK. If you set up your own DNS/DHCP you can do whatever you want
[23:42:19] <ayecee> mdns uses .local, so you can't use it for non-mdns
[23:42:56] <phogg> dTal: because mdns is unreliable and, when it fails, will result in a potentially-mysterious slowdown of everything.
