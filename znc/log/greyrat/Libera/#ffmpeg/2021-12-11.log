[00:08:40] <emcodem> @DaveGemini what you say does not make sense in so many ways... need more details
[00:10:31] <DaveGemini> this script...i had to change some things to get it to work..it finally did.....but the webp animations werent looping in a browser
[00:10:34] <DaveGemini> https://github.com/DonCanjas/mpv-webp-generator
[00:12:13] <DaveGemini> it uses ffmpeg
[00:12:42] <BtbN> Setting a video to loop is something you need to do via JS
[00:26:50] <emcodem> funny, for me it loops indefinitely when i set -loop 0 or any other value but as soon as -loop is missing, it just plays once
[00:27:29] <emcodem> @DaveGemini, insert -loop 10 or such directly after -i "%s"
[00:28:14] <emcodem> i guess webp is not really  a video @BtbN ^^
[00:31:56] <DaveGemini> wow u nailed it...some smart people in here.......it works now in a browser
[00:32:16] <emcodem> the mightiness of google :D
[00:32:38] <emcodem> (or bing, yahoo, whatever you prefer ) :P
[00:32:46] <DaveGemini> yea webp can be a still picture, and a animation like a gif......only webp animation offers a huge difference in compression
[00:33:00] <DaveGemini> u can now have 720p or even 1080p webp animations at decent size

[00:45:56] <Nact> Is it possible to record audio from pipewire with ffmpeg?
[00:46:42] *** Joins: Buster_ (~Buster@46.160.36.66)
[00:50:08] <kepstin> Nact: yes; use the pulseaudio input format (pulse)
[00:50:35] <kepstin> pipewire provides pulseaudio compatibility, so a different input format isn't needed for audio
[00:51:21] <JEEB> last I checked the pipewire "native" audio interface was really similar to pulse as well
[00:51:38] <JEEB> so I'm not really 100% into why the "native" one should be preferred (at this point of time)
[00:51:51] <JEEB> maybe in the future the pipewire "native" API will come with benefits
[00:52:27] <JEEB> and if someone reads some negativity in that, don't. it's just my first impression from the APIs when someone made an example.
[00:56:41] <kepstin> the pipewire folks, as far as audio goes, are recommending apps don't attempt to use the pipewire protocol directly, fwiw, but prefer using either jack or pulse protocols.
[00:57:08] <zeromind> https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/wikis/FAQ#what-audio-api-do-you-recommend-to-use mhm, just found that again
[00:57:41] <kepstin> (video is a different story, which probably will require ffmpeg grows the ability to talk to pipewire at some point - it would be nice to get screencapture via xdg portals for wayland desktops, which requires talking pipewire)
[00:58:04] <JEEB> yea the video interface seems much more useful
[00:58:10] <JEEB> since it's actually "new stuff"
[00:58:33] <JEEB> although for stuff like video cameras I'm not sure they will fix stuff like crappy timings from v4l2 devices
[00:58:45] <JEEB> or synchronizing timestamps across audio and video
[00:59:01] <kepstin> who knows :/
[00:59:26] <kepstin> iirc the main purpose of the camera stuff in pipewire is to just fix having one app using the camera block other apps from being able to access it.
[00:59:30] <Nact> I tried -f pulse -ac 2 -i default but it doesn't seem to work resulting .mp3 makes no sound. And I get lots of "Application provided invalid, non monotonically increasing dts to muxer in stream 0"
[00:59:54] <kepstin> well, no sound probably just means your default audio capture device isn't what you expected
[01:00:18] <Nact> hmm how do I check that?
[01:00:35] <kepstin> use your desktop environment settings panel, or a pulseaudio app like pavucontrol

[12:43:24] <bencc1> can I get better performance when compiling from source instead of installing the ubuntu ffmpeg package?
[12:43:28] <bencc1> I don't have a gpu
[12:43:53] <furq> probably not enough to make back the time you spent building it
[12:44:49] <furq> ffmpeg and any external encoders you might want to use do cpu feature detection at runtime
[12:44:58] <furq> so you don't really gain anything from -march=native or whatever
[12:47:17] <bencc1> thanks. I'll keep using the distro package
[12:51:18] <rendar> i'm trying to extrapolate audio from video without re-encoding the audio, and i have this: `ffmpeg -i input-video.avi -vn -acodec copy output-audio.aac` -- now question is: how can i be sure that the codec is aac? how can i set the right extension to the output audio file?
[12:51:49] <furq> you can't
[12:51:53] <furq> but you could just use .mka
[12:54:36] <rendar> which is an universal audio extension?
[12:54:46] <furq> it's just mkv
[12:54:55] <rendar> ok
[12:55:05] <furq> by convention you use .mka if it's just one audio stream and nothing else
[12:55:15] <furq> but it'll hold whatever and it's fairly well supported

[23:14:04] <bencc1> is it possible to change video with variable framerate to a fixed framerate without re-encoding?
[23:16:35] * NyB had not known there were variable framerate videos
[23:17:13] <furq> bencc1: -bsf:v setts=N/(25*TB)
[23:18:20] <bencc1> furq: something like this?
[23:18:21] <bencc1> ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:a copy -c:v copy -bsf:v setts=N/(25*TB) out.mp4
[23:18:26] <furq> sure
[23:18:26] <DHE> they exist. implementation details vary. sometimes you specify timestamps for each frame, sometimes it's still at a "fixed" framerate but you can skip frames perhaps with a 0 byte frame payload
[23:18:37] <bencc1> where 25 is the desired framerate?
[23:18:41] <furq> yeah
[23:18:52] <bencc1> thanks. I'll try it
[23:19:51] <bencc1> furq: will it drop/duplicate frames as needed to make it constant framerate?
[23:20:04] <furq> no you can't do that without reencoding
[23:20:08] <bencc1> or will it change timestamp to stretch/shrink
[23:20:11] <JEEB> NyB: the most common source for variable frame rate stuff nowadays are mobile phones :)
[23:20:26] <bencc1> furq: so it's not useful for my usecase. thanks
[23:20:27] <JEEB> so it has really become commonplace
[23:20:54] <furq> unless it's an intra only codec in which case it's probably lossless anyway

[23:51:46] <bencc1> how can I know how many threads I need for encoding 720p?
[23:51:56] <bencc1> 4 seems to work but is there a way to know for sure?
[23:52:51] <NyB> bencc1: I suspect that would highly depend on your video (input & output) and your CPU
[23:53:36] <NyB> for example, any CPU can encode 720p on a single thread if you don't care about how long it takes
[23:53:58] <bencc1> cpu is amd 5950x
[23:54:13] <bencc1> I need it in realtime for screen capture

[23:54:32] <bencc1> I can add a bit of overhead but want to be sure that it's enough
[23:55:10] <furq> it depends entirely on the input video
