[00:09:27] <dob1> ok I will look for another guide
[00:10:09] <greycat> You're probably over-complicating it by a *lot*.  It's not intended to be so hard that a guide is needed.
[00:10:49] <greycat> On the server, you install the nfs server software, put a line or two in /etc/exports, restart the NFS server because it didn't start up the first time because there was nothing in exports, and voila.
[00:10:58] *** Quits: allorder (allorder@user/allorder) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:11:26] <greycat> Any time you edit /etc/exports after that, you run "exportfs -a" if you only added lines, or else "exportfs -u -a" to un-export everything, and then "exportfs -a" to export everything.
[00:11:50] *** Quits: shivamsoni (~shivamson@117.217.84.30) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:11:52] <greycat> And absolutely none of this is correct for NFSv4 of course.
[00:12:29] <greycat> On the client, you simply install the NFS client software, and then   mkdir /foo ; mount myserver:/bar /foo
[00:12:43] <greycat> And if that doesn't work, *then* you dig into reasons why, possibly set things up so that it never tries v4, and so on.
[00:13:15] <dob1> from what I am reading the part of host.allow /etc/default/portmap where you specify ip allowed to mount the nfs share it's now moved to /etc/export
[00:13:43] <dob1> no, I am wrong
[00:14:22] *** Joins: mrfoobar (~MrFooBar@gateway/tor-sasl/mrfb)
[00:14:53] <greycat> The only other gotcha I've ever had with NFS on Debian is that if the *client* changes its IP address, you need to restart the NFS *server* software, because it will not look up the client a second time.  It continues using the original IP address.
[00:15:32] <greycat> Also, of course, the network interfaces (both client and server) should be marked "auto" *not* "allow-hotplug" or else the NFS software runs too early, name lookups all fail, and it falls apart.
[00:15:56] <greycat> (because as mentioned previously, the NFS server will not look up names a second time)
[00:17:19] <dob1> I was not aware of this!
[00:18:58] <dob1> but this will affect only if you mount the nfs share via /etc/fstab, right?  I was going to use autofs
[00:19:32] <greycat> autofs is a separate layer on top of all this.  Get the basic mount command to work first, and then you can worry about whether you want a static mount in fstab or an autofs setup.

[01:59:42] <dpkg> The release following Debian 11 "Bullseye" is codenamed "Bookworm" and will be Debian 12. Bookworm is the librarian in Toy Story 3, a big green worm with a flashlight and keeper of the instruction manuals. It is the current "testing" release.

[03:00:08] <Hobz> I'm thinking about just using a gparted live USB
[03:00:13] <jhutchins> Hobz: ALWAYS back up your data if you're messing with partitions.  It's very easy for something to go wrong, loosing everything.

[03:00:31] <Hobz> It's a pretty recent install, I don't have much on here to lose
[03:00:32] <ectospasm> It should be quite simple.
[03:00:36] <jhutchins> Hobz: As long as you're backing it up, one of the easiest way is to just re-partition the drive, then restore.
[03:00:39] <tomreyn> bolovanos: i don't think apache httpd would fully log that as the system hostname, though
[03:01:11] <Hobz> Hmm
[03:01:42] <Hobz> What gets me is that this is the / mountpoint that's getting resized

[03:02:20] <ectospasm> Hobz:  it probably should not be mounted.  You can boot the archiso and resize it that way.

[03:27:22] <ens> when i boot into the live cd of a related distro it seems to throttle up and down correctly according to load.

[03:29:23] <somiaj> millican: in what context, debian doesn't install any non-free firmware by default, unless you use a non-free image. Could it be you were using a non-free live image and installed using an offical installer?
[03:29:53] <PMT> they also said "related distro", so who knows what they mean

[03:34:36] <millican> It was a permission setting on a file in /sys/devices for the fan.

[03:38:06] <ens> yeah it's a pretty tough one, i thought i had it pinned down a few times but i'm kinda at a loss. if there was some way i could see what ubuntu is actually doing to establish the fan control properly then i could start investigating how to get that online in bullseye.. but i am not sure why it is working on this live image.
[03:40:13] <PMT> If it were me, I'd figure out if the temperature the CPU thinks it is is related to whether it's spinning up and down or not - e.g. is Debian maybe driving the cores at full throttle all the time? If not, then whether one of them is configuring something to manage the fans and the other isn't, or is leaving it half-configured, or something, and then, if both are actively controlling it with something, how do 
[03:40:19] <PMT> their versions and configs differ?
[03:40:28] <millican> do the firmware-linux-nonfree drivers have hardware drivers like that?
[03:41:33] <millican> I like PMT's suggestions more than my own.
[03:45:23] <ens> yeah that's pretty much what i've been up to thusfar PMT. I tested with the debian boot at zero load and saw the core temperatures were steady at a low 30-40 degrees yet the fans were still going. I wasn't able to find any particular software that would show me anything to do with how the fans are being managed though... i'm open to suggestions
[03:45:41] <ens> however i do see than on the debian instance the package firmware-linux-nonfree is available but not installed.

[03:57:18] <sney> partition type for the usb stick doesn't matter, but make sure you boot both the debian installer and windows in the same mode, bios vs efi. a debian installer booted in bios mode will not be able to detect a windows efi installation, and vice versa.
[03:57:38] <ens> you can probably start by trying to verify it can see your disks and files on them. that's fairly straightforward if i remember correctly.

[06:42:53] <greycat> e.g. if you ran the upgrade inside "script" which is one of the things the release notes suggest
[06:44:16] <Rodon> . i simply upgraded from buster through apt full-upgrade ...
[06:45:24] <greycat> then there are no logs of the upgrade process's output

[10:18:47] <dpkg> The release notes for Debian 11 (Bullseye) are at https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ . See also <buster->bullseye>, <bullseye install guide>
[10:19:10] <somiaj> edufmass: I would read those, but during the upgrade you should comment backports out and only add bullseye-backports back after the upgrade

[10:26:39] <edufmass> somiaj, thank you! I'll read that. From backports I only have kernel 5 installed to be able to use wifi of the notebook, everything else is from buster
[10:27:18] <somiaj> Due to the ~bpo on the package versions, they will all nicely update to the bullseye version
[10:27:30] <somiaj> just make sure you have the kernel metapackage installed (which sounds like you do)

[13:05:36] <jelly> nod
[13:07:26] <PMT> jelly: I'm curious if you have an answer, where are experimental packages intended to be reasonable to install? I understand that they're flashing sirens NOT READY EVEN FOR UNSTABLE(tm), but if you think you have reason to try one, are they intended for use with unstable, or testing, or stable, or undefined?
[13:08:22] <jelly> PMT, the kernel is a relatively isolated component
[13:08:48] <PMT> Sure, I'm not talking specifically about whether it would be reasonable for them, I just was curious about the general answer.
[13:08:49] <Khepra> you can always use the upstream's, kernel.org tarbal and build a deb out of it. the Makefile already has debian targets
[13:09:13] <jelly> PMT, in general, builds in experimental are only meant to be used combined with unstable
[13:09:58] <n4dir> PMT: in those years since ~2006 i hardly ever heard anyone mention, not to speak of using something from experimental. If at all, it came up during the freeze. 
[13:10:32] <jelly> but if you need dunno, a newer kernel or nvidia blob to make your hardware work, and there's no other option, then you might be able to carefully pick just that
[13:10:37] <PMT> n4dir: well, I had occasion to consider it at one point, then decided that trying to convince it to play nice with my system might involve too much suffering, and let it go.

[13:29:25] <sgon> I thought the laptop should use AC power directly when the battery is 100% full charged. So the battery will not be used at all and will increase the battery lifetime. That is what I think for a long time.
[13:29:37] <amacater> Effectively, you're saying that the battery is showing 100% and still charging. You can afford to disconnect it. The risk you have - if charging is not showing/registering correctly - is of running down the battery and then _not_ being able to charge it again and it remaining discharged. Your call.

[13:32:10] <Khepra> indeed. and for that you'd need bigass heavy metal inductive coils and fat capacitors, to satisfy modern, very, very, very sensitive CPUs and other things

[13:35:09] <sgon> OK. I never know lapotp is always using battery even if when it's fully charged and AC connected. For all my old laptops, I always try to use power AC. I thought I rarely used its battery at all for more than 10 years...
[13:36:04] <Khepra> in the "old" times, before this new wave of soldered-on battries, we used to physically disconnect them when we were in the office mode with AC around. 
[13:36:41] <Khepra> if I hated laptops before, I hated them even more when they started coming with soldered on batteries. today I won't be caught dead with a laptop in my hands.
[13:37:04] <n4dir> not much a fan either. 
[13:37:11] <sgon> If battery is always used even if AC is connected and 100% fully charged, does it mean I should always unplug the power AC when it's fully charged? That is something new. I heard some people said that before and I thought that was a stupid idea....
[13:37:24] <amacater> You only get caught dead with a laptop in your hands when the li-ion catches fire :)
[13:38:24] <Khepra> sgon: yes, or see if there's a program for linux and your bios/acpi capabilities, where you can set the Li-ion charging regime. or maybe your bios has it.

[14:16:15] <mrfoobar> maybe thinkpads have some kind of battery controller that avoid full charge?

[17:53:53] <ansgar> zerowalker_w: You need to run it either as a system service (by pid 1, .service in /etc/systemd/system) or enable "linger" mode with `loginctl enable-linger ${user}`.
[17:54:15] <ansgar> zerowalker_w: Linger mode starts that user's systemd --user instance at boot without login.
[17:54:55] <Khepra> ansgar: are you sure about that? I thought lingering was only about not killing processes after logout
[17:55:15] <zerowalker_w> which is preferred? i knew of the first option but thought that was improper when i knew what user i wanted and could just have it with it, guess that was wrong
[17:55:32] <ansgar> Khepra: Yes. But not stopping the systemd --user instance after logout also happens with it.

[17:56:34] <zerowalker_w> do i still want default.target.wants? don't really get what those are
[17:56:36] <Khepra> ansgar: that does not mention starting services on boot
[17:57:34] <ansgar> Khepra: "If enabled for a specific user, a user manager is spawned for the user at boot and kept around after logouts."
[17:57:42] <Khepra> it does describe what I thought lignering did: permit processes and services to remain, started by that user, after logout
[17:57:56] <Khepra> ansgar: yes, user manager. doesn't explicitly state that user services are started on boot

[17:59:32] <Khepra> zerowalker_w: so what does the service actually do'

[18:08:32] <Khepra> so systemctl won't show user services unlesss you also add --user which duplicates the management effort

[20:33:41] <Miles8of9> guys one question... i have installed buster years ago accepting the default partitioning given by the installer... the question is: will my /boot partition be large enough to have kernel 5.10 which is a lot bigger than kernel 4???
[20:34:05] <hassoon> Miles8of9: you got busted
[20:34:07] <jelly> Miles8of9, it's not "a lot bigger"
[20:34:29] <PMT> how big is the partition? in the worst case, you could always turn down the number of modules it shoves in the initramfs and confirm it works properly and didn't somehow miss a required one.
[20:36:10] <jelly> Miles8of9, if you have a 100MB /boot, you might need to first uninstall all the kernels but the latest one
[20:36:34] <Miles8of9> boot is 237M large  137 used, 88 free
[20:37:56] <jelly> Miles8of9, uninstall kernels other than the one in "uname -r" output
[20:38:15] <jelly> package names, dpkg -S /boot/vmlinuz*
[20:39:15] <jelly> you can also do what PMT suggests but that might break things; edit /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf, replaces MODULES=most by MODULES=dep, rebuild initramfs, reboot and see if it works
[20:39:16] <Miles8of9> i see it.. i have 2 kernels at moment, the one i use and the previous one
[20:39:54] <jelly> remove the previous one
[20:40:20] <jelly> (by removing the package, not deleting files)
[20:40:38] <Miles8of9> but what will happen when the installer tries to keep 2 kernels from 5.10?
[20:40:49] <PMT> Miles8of9: what in particular is using the space in /boot? that's a lot of space being occupied for just two kernels...
[20:41:44] <PMT> Usually when I've managed that it's because I built an obscenely large module including debug symbols and stuffed it into initramfs...
[20:42:06] <jelly> if you have a VM, I can recommend using the -cloud-amd64 flavor of kernel builds; works well on KVM, ESXi
[20:42:11] <Miles8of9> initrd.img thing eats 53 mb each and i have 2
[20:42:32] <jelly> available since debian 10, and debian 9 lts
[20:42:37] <PMT> Miles8of9: I know of only one module set that big. What filesystems are you running? ;)
[20:43:13] <jelly> PMT, debian defaults to MODULES=most in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf ... you can imagine what that does
[20:43:44] <PMT> jelly: I am aware. I even suggested changing it above, and you suggested following my advice.

[20:44:22] <jelly> it's not unusual to have a 40MB initrd, 53 is maybe on the larger side but not that weird
[20:44:57] <Miles8of9> ok / is etx4... boot is ext2
[20:45:21] <Miles8of9> then i have a /boot/efi which is vfat
[20:45:28] <PMT> Shrug. Usually when I found my initramfs got huge, it was because I had hooks installed that lobbed the ZFS modules into it on regenerating. 
[20:45:39] <PMT> Either way, MODULES=dep would be my suggestion if you're constrained.
[20:46:14] <Miles8of9> i'll format the machine and make a larger /boot partition
[20:46:20] <Miles8of9> damn debian installer -_-
[20:46:21] <jelly> oh, the vmlinuz is indeed quite a bit biggerer
[20:46:37] <jelly> Miles8of9, sure, you do whatever's easier for you

[20:46:59] <PMT> Which, compared to the initramfs, is basically noise.
[20:47:41] <jelly> ah, it's the cloud-amd64 that is bigger :-P
[20:47:57] <PMT> Ah, how much so?
[20:48:00] <jelly> 4M -> 11M
[20:48:10] <PMT> What on earth did they shove in there?
[20:48:19] <jelly> but initrd 11M -> 17M
[20:48:23] <jelly> so who cares
[20:48:39] <Miles8of9> why do you have so small initrd?
[20:49:22] <PMT> We do keep telling you how to shrink it. Would you like us to tell you again?

[21:04:01] <Adoi> I cant remove mariadb. I prefer to make it work as it did before upgrade
[21:04:06] <sney> Adoi: what jelly said. and I'm still not sure you need to use an extra repo to use software that is already packaged in debian, but that's your choice.
[21:04:11] <sney> removing repos does not remove software.
[21:04:26] <jelly> Adoi, remove repos, not mariadb installation.

[21:04:35] <jelly> Adoi, that said, do you have a technical reason to avoid using Debian's own package?

[21:05:13] <jelly> Adoi, what is wrong with Debian 11 build of 10.5 mariadb for your use case?
[21:05:54] <Adoi> jelly, I needed sometime somewhere to add these repos because something didnt work otherwise, but it has been a good while I forgot what it was
[21:06:06] <jelly> Adoi, does everything work right now?
[21:06:26] <Adoi> jelly I havent tried, I upgraded, ran apt update and this error came
[21:06:50] <Adoi> I will check 
[21:07:24] <jelly> Adoi, did you follow the official instructions for the release upgrade?  I'm pretty sure they tell you to disable third party repos before doing the release upgrade.

[21:08:39] <jelly> Adoi, in any case, check whether your mariadb service works.  If it works, and your data is still there, then just remove references to mariadb.org repos from sources.list, and run "apt update" again.  You can comment them out if unsure.

[22:49:37] <linsux> The repository 'http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye/updates Release' does not have a Release file.
[22:49:44] <linsux> should i cross this out?

[22:50:20] <sney> !bullseye security
[22:50:20] <dpkg> On Debian 11 "bullseye" systems, there are two repositories that you should have in your sources.list aside from your main mirror. You should have an entry for "bullseye-security" which is <security> updates (and also "bullseye-updates" which is for <stable-updates>. See also <sources.list>. Note that you may also need to adjust your Default-Release and pinning settings for apt.
