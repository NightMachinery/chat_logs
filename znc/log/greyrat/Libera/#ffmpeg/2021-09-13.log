[08:27:21] <SnakesAndStuff> perhaps a stupid question....
[08:28:05] <SnakesAndStuff> When recording streams from webcams, and planning to recomine files at the bitstream level later, it is dumb for me to use -segment_format_options movflags=+faststart isn't it?
[08:28:38] <SnakesAndStuff> It'll just cause the clip to be processed, and possibly lag the ability to start the stream in the next file, etc? Just extra overhead that'll probably cause a video interrupt later?
[08:29:21] <SnakesAndStuff> I'm guessing it makes more sense to just let it copy the stream to disk and worry about recombining, using +faststart, etc later when I combine the segments back and not working with a live stream?

[16:38:40] <roxlu> hi! I'm updating some code to v4.x and in previous version I could use `AVFormatContext::streams[index]::codec` to access the `av_codec_context`. Is this the correct way to replace that: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/doc/examples/transcoding.c#L81-L96 ?
[16:41:40] <JEEB> seems correct enough
[16:42:13] <JEEB> you get the AVCodec, allocate a context for it and then set the params according to your codecpar from input
[16:43:02] <roxlu> ok thanks JEEB

[16:50:04] <haasn> what happens if I mutate AVCodecContext after the AVCodec has already been opened and is decoding frames?
[16:50:40] <haasn> in general, is there any way to change AVCodecContext options after the codec has already been initialized?
[16:50:59] <BtbN> Anything from nothing to a crash
[16:51:13] <BtbN> Some encoders have a specific runtime reconfig API
[16:51:29] <BtbN> like changing the bitrate in the middle of encoding
[16:52:59] *** Quits: Atsuko (~x@94.242.250.86) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:53:33] <haasn> in this case I'm interested in mutating AVCodecContext.export_side_data
[16:54:50] <JEEB> currnetly documented as "before initialization"
[16:54:54] <haasn> ah
[16:55:05] <haasn> and yeah it would be kinda race-y for h264dec at least
[16:55:14] <JEEB> frame threads could lead to funzies
[16:55:28] <haasn> so if I _do_ need to change something like this, I need to close the AVCodec and reinit it?
[16:55:35] <haasn> (and then resume decoding where I left off, somehow?)
[16:56:46] <JEEB> currently yes, I think. if that makes no sense then there'd have to be some thought regarding reconfiguration.
[16:57:08] <JEEB> in the best case you still have the buffers you started decoding with, and then you just flush & re-feed
[16:57:15] <JEEB> if they're gone then löörs lärä
[16:57:37] <haasn> :shrug: seems more trouble than it's worth
[16:58:17] <JEEB> basically you've already received some stuff and possibly some stuff is already in the threaded decoder if you have already decoded something
[16:58:29] <JEEB> so even if it was runtime-configurable
[16:58:38] <JEEB> you'd have lost the capability of getting that stuff?

[17:45:20] <sebbu> that reminds me of a question
[17:45:57] <sebbu> when i want to make a sample from a (longer) video, using copy (and not reencode), and i don't begin on a keyframe, sometimes there's issues
[17:46:18] *** Quits: beaver (~beaver@user/pong) (Remote host closed the connection)

[17:51:24] <JEEB> sebbu: requires actual logic and matching of the stream parameters to whatever you're trying to cut
[17:51:47] <JEEB> not impossible but it really becomes linked to knowing how to get certain values out of a specific encoder
[17:51:59] <JEEB> not really something you can generically just write code for
[17:52:31] <JEEB> f.ex. if you specifically aim for H.264 and x264, that is one specific thing where in theory you can write a mapping to attempt to match the parameter sets of the thing you're cutting
[17:56:25] <sebbu> JEEB, generically, it'ld be reading & decoding from the previous keyframe to the start of the extract, encoding the current (decoded) frame as a keyframe instead of the actual frame, and copy the rest (or the rest until the next keyframe, if there's issues in some codecs about that)
[17:57:07] <sebbu> i mean, at best you encode a single frame, at worse from starting frame to next keyframe
[17:57:43] <JEEB> that bit is generic, you're ignoring the fact that the stream needs to match the stuff that comes after
[17:57:59] <JEEB> in case of H.264/HEVC etc parameter sets need to match
[17:58:27] <JEEB> so that mapping is from parsing the input and trying to match. not impossible, but very much format<->encoder mapping, not generic
[17:59:04] <sebbu> nd you can't use similar/compatible parameter set ?

[18:03:03] <JEEB> sebbu: that is exactly the problem I'm describing. you need to map the input parameter sets into some encoder specific values that generate something close enough
[18:03:07] <JEEB> it'
[18:03:10] <JEEB> it's not impossible
[18:03:14] <JEEB> just requires effort and is not generic
[18:09:56] <sebbu> it could be generic if it exists for all codecs
[18:10:28] <sebbu> moreover, a lot of it would be generic, no ?
[18:11:29] <JEEB> the mappings between format<->specific encoder would take most of the logic I'd guess
[18:11:45] <JEEB> as I said, it definitely is possible but someone needs to write those mappings
[18:12:15] <JEEB> anyways, I'd probably put such an API client separate from ffmpeg.c :) poor ffmpeg.c already does enough stuff
[18:13:09] <sebbu> at the end, the goal is that it would be a -c copy_v2 or something in the end-user commandline

[21:10:42] <any1> I want to set up an rtmp server using libavformat. I tried creating a format context using avformat_alloc_output_context2(&ctx, NULL, "flv", "rtmp://...") but when I call init_output on it, it just crashes because there's an avio internally that's NULL.
[21:11:20] <any1> It seems that I need  to open up the avio using avio_open2() and then run avio_accept() in a loop.
[21:11:49] <any1> Is this the correct way to do it or is there some simpler way?
[21:31:52] <BtbN> ffmpeg is not an rtmp server
[21:32:03] <BtbN> it can connect and stream to one, but not act as one
[21:33:36] <any1> uhm, there is a "listen" parameter
[21:33:57] <any1> And the avio_open2() stuff does seem to work
[21:34:46] <any1> and I can connect to the "server" with mpv, so something's definitely serving
[21:36:13] <BtbN> Is that maybe some librtmp magic? You should ideally not be using that
[21:36:23] <BtbN> Probably will bail if more than one user connects anyway
[21:36:28] <BtbN> use a proper server

[23:07:06] <JEEB> there's multiple things on multiple sides
[23:07:26] <JEEB> decoding-side you can build with libdav1d and libaom, of which dav1d is recommended

[23:07:59] <JEEB> so /34
[23:08:23] <BtbN> various hwaccels also support it
[23:08:26] <JEEB> *so you just build the FFmpeg with whatever of those enabled, and those will be included in the libavcodec binary

[23:10:24] <JEEB> yup
[23:10:35] <JEEB> it all depends on what the FFmpeg binary was built against, of course
[23:11:04] <JEEB> see `ffmpeg -decoders |grep "av1"` or `ffmpeg -encoders |grep "av1"`
[23:11:49] <JEEB> the decoder section will show a "native" av1 decoder, but that's the basics to enable hw decoding APIs to handle it
