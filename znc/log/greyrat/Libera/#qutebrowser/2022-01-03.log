[04:53:41] <topcat001> I have noticed that the python process leaks memory.
[04:56:24] <topcat001> I'll do another test soon to see if this is still the case on my always on OpenBSD machine. My Linux laptop gets shut down frequently so don't see it there.

[12:08:12] <ktprograms> Hi, is it possible to fill the cmd text with the current search query (when using duckduckgo)? I mean something like 'go' but show only the plaintext query and not the url. As far as I know, Safari is the only browser that can do this (Firefox can't).
[12:08:52] *** Joins: alpha_Aquilae (~ircII@user/alpha-aquilae/x-1057823)
[12:11:38] <toofar> if it's a query parameter you can write a userscript to pull it out easy enough and then call :set-cmd-text -s {whatever}
[12:19:00] <ktprograms> toofar: Thanks, I'll think whether I want to go through the trouble to write it since I don't really need it that much.
[13:39:07] <emanuele6> ktprograms: oh, c'mon. it is not that hard :)
[13:41:01] <emanuele6> something like this should work https://0x0.st/osFm.txt
[13:41:12] *** Joins: dnv (~dnv@213.80.broadband16.iol.cz)
[13:42:02] <emanuele6> it sets the cmd-text to the value of the first `q' in the query string if it is present, otherwise it behaves like `go' 
[13:44:02] <The-Compiler> emanuele6: sys.exit, not os.exit
[13:44:37] <emanuele6> sys.exit raises an exception with a message afaik
[13:44:48] <emanuele6> i wanted to exit with status 2 there
[13:45:01] <The-Compiler> emanuele6: sys.exit(2) does that
[13:45:22] <The-Compiler> emanuele6: os.exit(2) gives you a "AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'exit'."
[13:46:03] <The-Compiler> (there is os._exit, but that's not something you would typically use, as it's a hard exit without any cleanup)
[13:46:08] <emanuele6> oh
[13:46:11] <emanuele6> oops
[13:46:38] <emanuele6> you right, thank you
[13:47:20] <emanuele6> i though exit() would be in the `os' module, but i forgot to check if it actually was
[13:47:57] <emanuele6> and i thought `sys.exit()' printed an exit message because i usually see it used as `sys.exit("Error message")'
[13:48:08] <The-Compiler> yeah, both work
[13:49:09] <The-Compiler> "The optional argument arg can be an integer giving the exit status (defaulting to zero), or another type of object. [...] If another type of object is passed, None is equivalent to passing zero, and any other object is printed to stderr and results in an exit code of 1. In particular, sys.exit("some error message") is a quick way to exit a program when an error occurs.
[13:49:10] <emanuele6> i replaced os.exit() with sys.exit() http://0x0.st/osFB.txt
[13:49:16] <emanuele6> The-Compiler: thank you again
[13:49:20] <The-Compiler> sure thing :)
[13:49:29] <emanuele6> yeah, i am reading the docs ;)
[13:50:58] <emanuele6> that is how i learned of the url.parse, etc, but i didn't check `os.exit()' because i assumed it was there; i don't use python much
[13:54:09] <ktprograms> emanuele6: The-Compiler: Thank you very much for making this script!
[13:59:17] <ktprograms> So if I wanted to have a version that adds a -t (new tab) to the open, I would need to duplicate most of the script code, right?

[14:01:48] <mkonig> Hi. Is there a way to select which part of a web page should have the focus? When I open jira's backlog view, the focus is somewhere else than the backlog and I can not use jk to scroll the list. It would be cool to have something like hints for focus. Currently I have to click in the  area, then I can scroll.
[14:02:38] <The-Compiler> mkonig: nope - there is https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/4715 but it probably requires some work before it can go in
[14:04:22] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: So I would add arguments to :spawn, then get it using sys.argv?
[14:04:41] <The-Compiler> ktprograms: exactly (or use something like argparse to do that for you)
[14:06:03] <ktprograms> The-Compiler: Ok, thanks!
[14:14:54] <mkonig> The-Compiler: Cool. I'll try it out. Thanks for pointing me to it.
[14:16:42] <mkonig> The-Compiler: BTW do you think fuzzy links would be a good idea? My usecase: As I am anyhow typing I could hit f to show hints which would have full text and then are filtered by fuzzy search until only one is left. Then one should press return (or autoselect).
[14:18:09] <mkonig> It might take some more typing then 3 letter hints. The advantage I see is that I can type what I see on the page and I can type the way I see it. Some people would type the first word, some are used to to recognize the first letter of each word, so they would type these.
[14:19:21] <mkonig> For example if the link has the name "github search". I most probably would type "gitsearch" as I am used to use git on command line.
[14:26:40] <The-Compiler> mkonig: note you can already type to filter hints in number hint mode
[14:27:00] <The-Compiler> not fuzzy though. Not sure if fuzzy matching makes much sense there to be honest.
[14:29:11] <mkonig> The-Compiler: No problem. I will continue to improve the ContextHinter that I submitted. One feature I would like to add is to give hints with the same url the same hint text. I am not an web expert at all and after some research it seems to be very hard to know the url a hint is pointing to because many sides build the url after one clicks on the
[14:29:12] <mkonig> hint. Or am I missing something?
[14:29:28] <The-Compiler> ktprograms: 
[14:29:31] <The-Compiler> huh
[14:29:33] <The-Compiler> sorry
[14:29:46] <The-Compiler> still trying to switch to a new keyboard layout :D
[14:30:55] <mkonig> Hope it is neo2
[14:31:25] <The-Compiler> mkonig: yes, see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/5287 - picking that up and improving it would probably be more useful than building that all on top of your ContextHinter

[21:11:53] <blaub> Hello, just a question about :message-info. If I would like to show the current page url in that message, is that possible? I tried to `:message-info $QUTE_URL` but it doesn't get replaced by the current page url.
[21:26:12] <The-Compiler> blaub: $QUTE_URL is an environment variable for userscripts, not something the qutebrowser commandline interprets
[21:26:19] <The-Compiler> blaub: you might want {url}
[21:28:32] <blaub> ah thanks, The-Compiler, I even tried {URL} but they're written lower case there :)
[21:29:26] <blaub> The-Compiler: do you also know if there is a way to tell qutebrowser to open :help always in new tab?
[21:29:33] <blaub> i lost so many tabs this way :D
[21:29:51] <The-Compiler> blaub: depends, how do you open the help usually?
[21:30:54] <blaub> e.g. with `:help bind` if i want to know about bind
[21:31:17] <The-Compiler> blaub: you can do :help -t bind (and there always is :back of course)
[21:31:41] <The-Compiler> blaub: you can also alias :help to :help -t, but IIRC you will unfortunately lose the completion that way
[21:31:45] <blaub> oh great, i guess there is also :help help then? :)
[21:32:02] <The-Compiler> :help :help, yes
[21:32:32] <The-Compiler> also lets not forget the most important command, :Ni!
[21:32:38] <blaub> :Ni! O_o
[21:32:59] <blaub> looks dangerous
[21:34:02] <The-Compiler> it's not (but only available in recent-ish qutebrowser versions)
[21:34:45] <blaub> is the version on archlinux recent enough?
