[00:15:42] <codebam> oh okay, then should work fine. it supports LDAC if the headphones support it
[00:15:55] <DLange> codebam: it has two profiles (headset or headphones, the latter has no mic, make your bluetooth stack connect to the headset "device")
[00:16:31] <codebam> DLange: how do I do that when connecting with bluetoothctl?
[00:16:48] <codebam> I usually just connect with bluetoothctl and it registers all the devices in pipewire / pulseaudio
[00:16:52] <uwharrie> I've also heard good things about the Creative BT-W2 which presents itself as a USB audio device and then talks BT directly to the headset so you don't have to battle with bluetooth

[00:17:25] <codebam> you mean like the gnome settings?

[02:05:17] <CoderCop> For what it's worth, it's usually not a great idea to run a dev web server process as root like that. Aside from making debugging harder because it will write files you can't easily edit, it has pretty serious security implications. I might suggest just connecting to port 8000 or using something well-testet like nginx as a reverse proxy if you need it open on 80.

[03:29:07] <bootedoffmybox> from the conversation I had last night, we worked out (with lots of kind help) that I need to create (I think) an ext4 partition so that permissions for linux files within my home directory are safe and do not get lost. I'm doing this on a Seagate USB 1tb portable. I am currently booted into via a Linux Mint live USB stick with the 1tb external
[03:29:07] <bootedoffmybox> hard drive plugged into another port. My question is, in Gparted, it asks about space preceeding, space proceeding and offset measurement when shrinking the existing partition on the 1tb external. Do these make any difference please - a) for shrinking existing b) for new one and also is it just one ext4 partition that needs creating or does it need
[03:29:08] <bootedoffmybox> swaps and things or is that just for live systems? Thanks
[03:29:15] <BCMM> jpic: could probably achieve the same thing using socat. don't know if that helps.
[03:29:39] <jpic> yes i see, i'm going to learn this command too

[03:33:49] <bootedoffmybox> BCMM 1) Am I correct in saying that a fat32 won't reserve permissions on files and will "forget them" (therefore I'm not sure if there actually are other or better options) 2) Hard drive suspected to be failing and moving onto a new laptop tomorrow so trying to get things ready - 3. I think the seagate external comes shipped with fat32 4. I have
[03:33:49] <bootedoffmybox> contents already on there so it makes sense to protect existing contents on external at same time
[03:34:39] <BCMM> yes, fat32 can't store unix permissions
[03:35:07] <bootedoffmybox> yep so I think this is the logic from yesterday :)  so, it's the other questions now
[03:35:13] <BCMM> your home directory should be stored on a proper linux filesystem, and ext4 is the default for most distros
[03:35:34] <bootedoffmybox> so will an ext4 partition on the external do the same trick?
[03:36:00] <BCMM> i'm afraid i don't understand what you're doing, though. are you installing linux on the seagate 1tb USB drive?
[03:36:16] <bootedoffmybox> nooo, just backing up to it for transfer tomorrow to new laptop
[03:36:24] <bootedoffmybox> hard drive failing on old laptop i suspect
[03:36:31] <bootedoffmybox> and its a bit knackered!
[03:36:43] <BCMM> ah, i see. this seagate thingy is just a way to transfer/back up your home directory?
[03:37:09] <bootedoffmybox> yes - further, I can't actually boot into Linux on my laptop currently and I think we have got to a stage where we have given up with trying to fix it
[03:37:14] <BCMM> something that you could do is just put it all in a big .tar file

[03:37:25] <BCMM> .tar is a bit like .zip, but it supports permissions
[03:37:26] <bootedoffmybox> so hence I am on the live usb stick
[03:37:35] <thad_the_man> fat and ntfs do not have any idea of ownership of files. So no permissions.
[03:37:46] <bootedoffmybox> ahhhh i see so the tarball mimics the ext4 anyway
[03:37:54] <BCMM> it wouldn't matter what sort of filesystem you store the tar file on, because the permissions are stored within the tar format
[03:38:10] <BCMM> bootedoffmybox: however, fat32 has a 4GB limit on individual files
[03:38:29] <bootedoffmybox> yes, however, given that i'm booting from a live usb stick does this rules out the tarball option please?
[03:38:34] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[03:38:34] <BCMM> so unless your home directory is small, you'd need to split up the tar file, which introduces more complexity and more chances to make mistakes
[03:38:54] <bootedoffmybox> ah yes, so back to ext4 partition then

[03:59:18] <BCMM> bootedoffmybox: this is actually dead simple, it just kind of looks confusing. if you don't need to input to the exact megabyte how big you want the partition to be, the widget with the draggable edges makes it more obvious what you're actually doing, imho

[05:32:47] <bootedoffmybox> so that wouldnt work work. Yeah, but the reality is you don't expect your filesystem to go pop and so there will be always be stuff that is not backed up.

[05:33:16] <ayecee> nope, it's a filesystem limitation.

[05:39:06] <Psi-Jack[m]> And tar.
[05:39:08] <bootedoffmybox> (that's that's 2 hours)
[05:39:16] <bootedoffmybox> right
[05:39:21] <Dagmar> If she'd just been saving her damn work before going to bed, the workstation could have caught fire in the middle of the night and it would just mean amazon-next-daying some new hardware in
[05:39:36] <bootedoffmybox> but the issue with that is if it fails, i don't know what is transferred and not transferred or it will fail.
[05:39:37] <ayecee> Dagmar: ever tried the "file history" thing? user-accessible shadow copies, super awesome, but i guess doesn't help if you don't save
[05:40:05] <Dagmar> ayecee; Yeah, WIndows Backup basically wrangles that, but it's very bad about actually getting rid of old copies

[05:40:30] <bootedoffmybox> i'm already quite aware that anything is possible. The way that you are trying to push me into is not suited. To put it a more simple and direct way, how do I transfer between one window to the other.
[05:40:32] <masoudd> no autosave or anything?
[05:40:33] <Psi-Jack[m]> bootedoffmybox: You can list the contents of a tar file.
[05:40:34] <ayecee> haven't had a problem with that so far.
[05:40:39] <Dagmar> Again part of the reason why the files in first raid5 volume are getting rsynced over to shares on the second raid5 volume
[05:40:46] <ayecee> just a matter of time i guess.
[05:40:52] <Psi-Jack[m]> bootedoffmybox: It's not just "one window to another"

[06:33:14] <SineDeviance> video/audio compression algorithms are designed to be decoded on-the-fly, whereas huffman (i.e. zip) compression algorithms are designed to be deflated before they are read

[06:55:30] <coldenbrewed> yeah sorry I forgot
[06:55:34] <SineDeviance> Well yeah, iPads don't work with NFS

[08:12:34] <Blondie101010> FuriousGeorge:  with so much RAM, you probably should not have more than 1-2GB of swap max
[08:12:40] <Blondie101010> unless you hibernate
[08:12:46] <bernard__> CoderCop: are you a coder and a cop?
[08:12:50] <Psi-Jack[m]> You should never have more than 2GB Swap ever Anyway.
[08:12:55] <CoderCop> bernard__: I am
[08:13:00] <Blondie101010> it's needed for hibernation

[08:13:11] <Psi-Jack[m]> Blondie101010: When they actually FIX Hibernation, they
[08:13:21] <Psi-Jack[m]> They will likely hopefully make it a seperate file from swap.
[08:13:26] <FuriousGeorge> Blondie101010:  im using ramdisks that take up 224 of it off the bat
[08:13:31] <Psi-Jack[m]> But, until they actually FIX hibernation....
[08:13:33] <FuriousGeorge> so i don't have much
[08:13:45] <lockywolf> I never had any problems with hibernation.
[08:13:49] <Dagmar> So... how many tmpfs volumes do you have mounted?

[08:15:20] <Psi-Jack[m]> You also can't use it with SecureBoot.
[08:15:25] <Praxis> How would one go about running komga as a service?
[08:15:35] <lockywolf> why would I use "SecureBoot"?
[08:15:43] <lockywolf> it's an absolute security theater

[08:18:43] <neshpion> i should encrypt my data, but my security measure is just never going outside
[08:18:43] <Psi-Jack[m]> lockywolf: And this thing called "backups"....
[08:18:47] <Praxis> Psi-Jack[m] I don't know what that means
[08:18:47] <CoderCop> Praxis: I use supervisord for stuff like that.
[08:18:54] <bernard__> CoderCop: same
[08:18:58] <lockywolf> so I am carefully ensuring that I have at least 5 copies of 100% unencrypted data
[08:19:01] <bernard__> +1 supervisor
[08:19:03] <Praxis> CoderCop I'll look it up
[08:19:04] <Psi-Jack[m]> CoderCop: Why not systemd?
[08:19:24] <CoderCop> Psi-Jack[m]: Old habits, I guess. Have used supervisord since before Debian switched to systemd.
[08:19:32] <Psi-Jack[m]> heh.
[08:19:32] <Dagmar> Psi-Jack[m]: becasue nothing says "professional coder" like reinventing the wheel, over nad over
[08:19:43] <Psi-Jack[m]> LOL
[08:19:44] <lockywolf> because I literally had the case when I was only able to restore the data on a friend's Windows XP machine, when 4/5 copies were out
[08:19:58] <Psi-Jack[m]> Well, SupervisorD has it's uses still for some things it does that doesn't happen with SystemD.
[08:20:07] <bernard__> !ops Dagmar being an asshole to supervisor users
[08:20:11] <Psi-Jack[m]> Web-based log access, for example, though you can sorta get that with systemd.
[08:20:17] <lockywolf> encryption is not without its benefits, but for a user's laptop it is a 100% overkill
[08:20:23] <Psi-Jack[m]> bernard__: Grow up?
[08:20:27] <Dagmar> Indeed.
[08:20:27] <lockywolf> and very dangerous if abused
[08:20:43] <bernard__> Psi-Jack[m] you mean Dagmar?
[08:20:48] <Psi-Jack[m]> SupervisorD also has templating to easily run and change the number or replicated applications (worker tasks).
[08:20:48] <Dagmar> bernard__: How about you slink back into whatever hole you crawled out of
[08:20:58] <bernard__> Dagmar: okay?

[08:21:41] <lockywolf> stop it,  guys
[08:21:54] <SineDeviance> <lockywolf> encryption is not without its benefits, but for a user's laptop it is a 100% overkill <-- have to disagree, that's one of the ways data breaches can occur. users tend to keep data on their laptops. having their disks encrypted ensures the data doesn't fall into the wrong hands in the event the laptop does
[08:21:54] <Dagmar> lockywolf: They can have my disks.  What they're not getting is my artisinal collection of memes
[08:22:16] <Dagmar> ...also, a few bits of weaponized code and number of files of questionable provenence

[08:22:41] <lockywolf> sorry, can you repeat that? I am filling in my forms
[08:22:50] <Dagmar> Laptops should practically mandate disk encryption
[08:22:54] <SineDeviance> and good luck NOT having full disk encryption now if you have to be PCI, HIPPA, or SOC-compliant
[08:23:01] <Psi-Jack[m]> lockywolf: 100% overkill though, No absolutely not. A laptop is a mobile device, often containing personal data. I do NOT want my laptop stolen, lost, or otherwise, left without my custody, only to be used to gain access to private information someone could potentially use to make my life a living hell for unknown numbers of years.
[08:23:02] <lockywolf> So, your name, address, and social security number are?..
[08:23:02] <neshpion> SineDeviance: that sounds like cases in which the 'user' is an employee and the laptop belongs to the company, in which case i would see encryption being good policy
[08:23:15] <Psi-Jack[m]> So, no, 100% false on your behalf to that 100% overkill,
[08:23:22] <Dagmar> neshpion: No it's literally required if you're in the health industry
[08:23:25] <SineDeviance> neshpion: yeah, exactly. isn't that what we're saying?
[08:23:25] <neshpion> SineDeviance: but for a personal laptop with personal files on it... maybe overkill

[08:23:47] <neshpion> when i hear 'user' i think of personal non-company individual doing non-company things
[08:23:50] <SineDeviance> neshpion: again, I disagree
[08:23:57] <SineDeviance> all of my systems are running FDE now
[08:23:58] <neshpion> SineDeviance: depends on what you have on there i guess
[08:24:01] <Dagmar> HIPPA auditors will just fine you on the spot if you've got users running around with Windows and don't have bitlocker as a requirement
[08:24:04] <SineDeviance> even my rackmount server is running FDE
[08:24:17] <lockywolf> it makes more sense for servers
[08:24:18] <neshpion> i for one am not ashamed of people finding out what i get off to
[08:24:18] <SineDeviance> and I don't even run anything critical on that
[08:24:35] <SineDeviance> neshpion: it's not about porn, it's about access
[08:24:40] <neshpion> to what?
[08:24:40] <Dagmar> nashpion: How about all your passwords and pay card information that's right there in your browser?
[08:24:42] <lockywolf> access to what?
[08:24:52] <SineDeviance> neshpion: my client's systems. my own systems. all kinds of things
[08:24:55] <Psi-Jack[m]> lockywolf: Not even just that. There's way more situations, and Dagmar's literally pointing out another one. But Personal laptop, might have my credit card numbers (it does, encrypted on LUKS and SQLCrypt, but still it's there).
[08:25:00] <lockywolf> why would you put pay card information into the browser?
[08:25:01] <Psi-Jack[m]> My password manager is on my laptop. So, yeah.
[08:25:12] <neshpion> Dagmar: it isn't, my passwords are all encrypted with my PGP key which has a long ass password on it
[08:25:14] <Psi-Jack[m]> lockywolf: How do you buy stuff/
[08:25:17] <neshpion> which isn't written down anywhere
[08:25:21] <bernard__> lockywolf: exactly
[08:25:23] <Psi-Jack[m]> Seriously.
[08:25:24] <bernard__> this isnt 1999
[08:25:28] <neshpion> Dagmar: i never let my browser save any credentials
[08:25:34] <lockywolf> by scanning a QR code with my phone?
[08:25:37] <neshpion> pipe passwords to xdotool -type
[08:25:51] <Dagmar> Well, good luck with that
[08:25:56] <Psi-Jack[m]> lol
[08:26:08] <lockywolf> I haven't used a bank card for about 5 years
[08:26:24] <Dagmar> For millions of other people, letting the browser act as a password store is a definite improvement over using 'rover123' as their password everywhere.
[08:26:34] <Psi-Jack[m]> lockywolf: So you're a troglodyte?
[08:26:44] <lockywolf> no, I use "mobile payments"
[08:26:45] <Psi-Jack[m]> I mean, seriously.

[08:40:18] <mlu> Firewire was basically a more expensive USB
[08:40:21] <lockywolf> I know what is FireWire in principle
[08:40:22] <Dagmar> It didn't take long for the industry to realize USB was a safer bet
[08:40:29] <SineDeviance> mlu: more expensive, but also a lot faster
[08:40:33] <lockywolf> But apart from video cameras, I haven't seen anything use it
[08:40:40] <SineDeviance> until USB3 came around, firewire was king

[08:41:05] <lockywolf> Fireware was, like, 400Mb/s, USB2 480Mb/s

[08:41:19] <lockywolf> in theory

[08:57:37] <Psi-Jack[m]> It spins up slowly.
[08:57:53] <Dagmar> If you don't need to change the service file, but only need to change the shell script it's calling... fewer steps.

[14:40:36] <EdwardIII> hmm i'm seeing intermittent 'curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer' when one server tries to do http to the other. issue seems to be only between these 2 machines, and it's intermittent. i don't think it's DNS (both machines see the same thing, both working and not working requests are seeing the same ip address etc). what next steps can i take to figure this damn thing out?
[14:40:53] <opal> tcpdump

[18:06:45] <fakuve> Hi so I wanna do a tricky thing. I want to set up an "action?" upon bootup , so that if a certain drive is been mounted upon bootup (if my key-drive is been present in the usb) , then certain files are placed in certain paths locally in the system (SSH keys, VPN certs etc..)
[18:08:03] <fakuve> I'm not really versed with systemd , init process, but I guess I shall create a unit for this? or maybe in one of the scripts that are been initialized upon boot such as `bashrc` `xinitrc` ....
[18:08:31] <fakuve> I want this to be triggered just for the tty1 , (so before X11)
[18:08:50] <fakuve> How would you proceed? a `systemd` unit?
[18:09:13] <mkulko> fakuve: something that comes off the top off my head is using cron to do that
[18:09:25] <fakuve> mkulko: cron would do yeah? ok
[18:09:41] <fakuve> Also I want this files to be deleted upon shutdown
[18:09:50] <fakuve> so also a cron task I reckon would do
[18:10:56] <mkulko> fakuve: also you can create a systemd unit that will exit after what you want has been done

[22:46:54] <SineDeviance> That bug has been around for years and until they fix it, I just can't use KDE on my work machines
