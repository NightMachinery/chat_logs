[16:45:53] <artao> LOL nice!
[16:47:15] <artao> with careful construction you can also build an obstruction mask to block out the sun's disk so you can see rim features better
[16:47:33] <artao> but regardless, the detail you can see in sun spots? AMAZING
[16:47:39] <artao> sun spots are fascinating
[16:47:57] <artao> i've seen numerous ones that look like mandelbrot variations
[16:48:27] <artao> not by eye thru a telescope. in pictures
[16:48:31] <louipx> block the corona?
[16:48:39] <louipx> :p
[16:48:41] <artao> no. the disk
[16:48:45] <artao> the ... oh
[16:48:47] <artao> :P
[16:49:34] <artao> you can also buy solar telescopes that allow you to see other wavelengths, like hydrogen alpha and calcium K
[16:49:41] <artao> so you can see the faculae
[16:49:47] <louipx> i have no idea what the disk is
[16:49:52] <artao> HUNDREDS of dollars
[16:49:57] <artao> the disk of the sun
[16:50:06] <artao> the sun itself as we normally see it
[16:50:10] <louipx> or the rim
[16:50:16] <artao> the corona is the outermost atmosphere of the sun
[16:50:27] <louipx> yes
[16:50:30] <artao> we can't normally see that. just during eclipses
[16:50:40] <artao> i don't think even a solar mask would let you see that
[16:51:04] <artao> tho not sure ... cuz the corona is also fascinating and a mystery ... cuz it's WAY WAY WAY hotter than expected
[16:51:15] <artao> which is why the Parker Solar Probe is going there
[16:51:28] *** Quits: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:52:00] <artao> so you can make a mask that is a tiny dot of the appropriate width for your telescope and the solar disk's diameter
[16:52:24] <artao> thus "blocking out the sun" so you can see stuff like solar flares and loops
[16:52:36] <artao> cuz otherwise the sun is too bright to see that stuff
[16:53:06] <artao> the downside is that it causes "spikes" in the image
[16:53:17] <artao> you know, like lots of space photos have around stars, right?
[16:54:05] <artao> those are because of the support structure (the vanes) for the secondary mirror cage. diffraction of incoming light. You want them to be as thin as possible, and as few as possible
[16:54:19] <artao> but that's only with reflector telescopes
[16:54:56] <artao> refractor telescopes don't have diffraction spikes because they have no such vanes or anything else in the optical path. straight unobstruted shot
[16:55:17] <artao> but THEIR flaw is achromatic abberation and astigmatism
[16:55:50] <artao> ... which can be corrected for with using glasses of different IOR and complex correcteive lens shapes
[16:57:24] <artao> mirrors don't have the achromatic abberation part, but can have the astigmatism part
[16:57:44] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[16:57:45] <artao> well .... first surface mirrors. 2nd surface mirrors the light has to travel thru the glass twice
[16:58:27] <louipx> the sun is hot
[16:59:52] <artao> rather
[17:00:09] <artao> yet the surface of the sun is less hot than the corona
[17:03:31] <artao> however, the corona is "oven hot" rather than "surface hot"
[17:04:15] <artao> which is to say, it's more like just sticking your inside an oven as opposed to touching any SURFACE inside the oven
[17:04:44] <artao> you can hold your hand inside a 500F oven for quite awhile. but touching a surface and you'll instantly have 3rd degree burns
[17:05:07] <artao> and the sun's corona is SUPER sparse. not dense. near vacuum even
[17:05:32] <artao> but millions to 10s of millions degrees kelvin (fahrenheit? celcius? ... pretty sure kelvin)
[17:06:13] <artao> the SURFACE of the sun is only hundreds of thousands of degrees (IIRC) but being near it would vaporize you
[17:06:23] <artao> super dense plasma
[17:06:51] <artao> <louipx> the sun is hot
[17:06:54] <artao> er ... wait
[17:07:06] <artao> did you mean hot as in temperature or hot as in "sexy"
[17:07:09] <artao> ;p
[17:08:37] <artao> after all, temperature is a measure of all the atoms and molecules (electrons in particular) of a medium
[17:08:51] <artao> their energy state
[17:09:22] <artao> if they're bouncing around a whole lot and moving fast the apparent temp is higher. and vice versa
[17:09:39] <louipx> both
[17:09:48] <artao> but if there's only a couple hundred molecules/atoms per square meter? they don't hit much
[17:09:49] *** louipx is now known as louipc
[17:10:15] <artao> and things IN that only experience the temperature when atoms bounce into em
[17:11:13] <artao> IN FACT! The solar shielding from the radiation of the sun's surface is  SO efficient that the science instruments actually have to be heated to function properly -- while inside the millions-of-degrees corona
[17:11:25] <artao> crazy stuff eh louipc?
[17:11:41] <artao> forgive me if i'm being .... what's it called

[17:12:46] <louipc> so it was all just a bunch of hot gas to me
[17:13:14] <artao> part of the reason this is ##music and not #music is that topics such as solar physics are more open to discussion cuz it can drive inspiration to make music
[17:13:44] <louipc> i dont buy that but ok

[17:53:44] <artao> SO awful :(
[17:54:10] <murthy> Yesterday I went for shopping at my favourite places and reminded them about this. They said they will start replacing single use plastic stuff with approved ones
[17:54:10] <artao> ever since China stopped taking the rest of the world's garbage it's become a much larger problem in africa and india
[17:54:12] <artao> :(
[17:54:15] <louipc> lol these stupid govts

[17:55:50] <louipc> its really not a problem
[17:56:05] <Jan> why do we make things with a service life of ten minutes 
[17:56:08] <louipc> and most 'single use' plastic i seen are actually multi-use
[17:56:12] <murthy> louipc: single use plastics are made with less microns thickness of plastic and are generally not recyclable and so they end up as microplastic and other forms climbing the food chain and harming the environment
[17:56:14] <Jan> out of materials that last 100,000 years

[18:10:31] <artao> they won't do it for moral reason or environmental reasons

[18:14:07] <murthy> only government is sovereign
[18:14:20] <murthy> but thats not the point why I am happy
[18:14:47] <murthy> I am happy because more people would be able to easily access crypto money
[18:14:58] <louipc> you wont feel the same way when the govt turns against you man
