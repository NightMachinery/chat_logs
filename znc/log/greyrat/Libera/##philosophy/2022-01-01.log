[04:37:22] <Ungwelian> :)
[04:38:46] <Ungwelian> Old alt. Back then, I wanted to make a point of being against Buddhist posturing.
[04:39:22] <Ungwelian> Instead of having some kind of structured "awakening mind", I'd just be a normal person.
[04:40:38] <Ungwelian> I saw far too many people making Buddhism a sort of status thing.
[04:41:02] <Ungwelian> Mystifying and reifying practises.
[04:42:24] <Ungwelian> Like, thinking is ok, but "meditation" is a special, far-east, mystical practise leading to "awakening".
[04:42:29] <causative_> "Zen is not some kind of excitement, but concentration on our usual everyday routine."
[04:42:38] <causative_> "If your practice is good, you may become proud of it.  What you do is good, but something more is added to it.  Pride is extra.  Right effort is to get rid of something extra."
[04:42:48] <causative_> "To have some deep feeling about Buddhism is not the point; we just do what we should do, like eating supper and going to bed.  This is Buddhism."
[04:42:59] <causative_> "If you are trying to attain enlightenment, you are creating and being driven by karma, and you are wasting your time on your black cushion."
[04:43:14] <Ungwelian> That's another word that I dislike. "Practise".
[04:43:34] <causative_> - Sunryu Suzuki
[04:43:39] <Ungwelian> Orwell would have a beef with it.
[04:43:44] <Ungwelian> "Use clear language."

[04:44:32] <causative_> in other words, to posture over Buddhism is to miss the point
[04:44:46] <Bakunin> yes for sure
[04:44:59] <causative_> the idea is to release your attachments, including the attachment of pride
[04:45:00] <Bakunin> altho, don't mistake beginner/intermediate for posturing
[04:45:09] <Bakunin> sangha can be good
[04:45:21] <Ungwelian> It seems like a lot of people who hate Christianity find Buddhism somehow a very different thing.
[04:45:30] <causative_> it is a very different thing
[04:45:30] <Bakunin> in the end, tho, buddhism is about being silent and alone
[04:45:46] <Ungwelian> Instead of "congregation", you call it "sangha". And tada, it's magically something else.
[04:45:59] <retrosenator> Bakunin: what about the "bad monks"?
[04:45:59] <Bakunin> if you are not silent, if you have any friends, it is not possible to come anywhere near any sort of enlightenment you seek

[04:46:56] <Bakunin> fun times, really
[04:46:59] <retrosenator> these buddist monks receive gifts
[04:47:02] <Bakunin> I support all three
[04:47:05] <retrosenator> they were caught selling them on the street
[04:47:18] <Ungwelian> I honestly think that quite a few of Western Buddhists are such because they're against Christianity, yet unfamiliar with Christianity.
[04:47:33] <Bakunin> for many years I was filled with compassion for people.  Then 2016 happened and I saw what the world was truly about
[04:47:48] <Bakunin> it stopped being a few weirdos writing about the CIA and started being my violent, evil neighbors
[04:48:04] <Bakunin> turns out, most humans are cooked to be little fucking demons
[04:48:06] <retrosenator> where did that get you lol?
[04:48:18] <Bakunin> that was when I knew I had finally transcended attachment
[04:48:28] <Bakunin> Enlightenment.
[04:48:32] <retrosenator> you are trying to live up to your own expectation of yourself?

[04:48:48] <Bakunin> no, negative utility.
[04:49:00] <Bakunin> helping people is stupid.  Killing them is better.
[04:49:11] <retrosenator> i saw this movie about a cult of people think they can reach enlightenment by torturing girls
[04:49:18] <Bakunin> in the latter, you will achieve financial gain for yourself.
[04:49:36] <Bakunin> that sounds pretty wild.  Humans deserve to go to hell, too bad it doesn't exist
[04:49:36] <Ungwelian> Buddhism is quite sexist too.
[04:50:08] <Bakunin> Ung, some/most types yes
[04:50:21] <Bakunin> but in truth, women have physical inferiorities to men
[04:50:24] <Ungwelian> The most senior nun being lower than the freshest monk.
[04:50:25] <retrosenator> they force all the monks away so just a few rich men have many wives
[04:50:44] <Ungwelian> And there's plenty of Buddhist sex scandals too.
[04:50:55] <Bakunin> yeah a large motivating factor in the spread of buddhism was conquest
[04:50:56] <retrosenator> no doubt
[04:51:09] <Bakunin> So, when you oppress a new group, you make them obey your hierarchies
[04:51:21] <retrosenator> good point
[04:51:23] <Bakunin> in this way, the entire ancient world became misogynist
[04:51:37] <retrosenator> it's a requirement for the history that occured
[04:51:46] <Bakunin> Islam isn't founded on clitorectomies.  Those came way, WAY before.
[04:51:59] <retrosenator> but they benefit from it
[04:52:05] <Bakunin> it subsumed that and many other misogynisticities
[04:52:06] <Ungwelian> And also isn't practised everywhere.
[04:52:10] <causative_> Zen Buddhism takes away most of the religious stuff - it's there but not focused on. What's left is a philosophy similar to stoicism, and a system of meditation
[04:52:24] <retrosenator> Ungwelian: what is?  breathing?
[04:52:28] <Bakunin> yeah zen is good, but it has its problems too
[04:52:29] <Ungwelian> IIRR, female genital mutilation is present in some tribal areas.
[04:52:47] <retrosenator> you mean billions of people
[04:53:04] <causative_> read Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind
[04:53:05] <Bakunin> I think people who do zazen too much are suffering mental issues with either hyperfocus or doing a bit to distract themselves
[04:53:31] <Bakunin> sitting on your ass for a full third of your life... sounds like a waste, he types
[04:53:35] <causative_> maybe they do zazen because they want to heal from their mental issues
[04:53:37] <Bakunin> :D
[04:53:49] <Bakunin> causative_ ++
[04:53:51] <Ungwelian> I remember a story about some Japanese Zen master, who was brutal towards his students. The students ended up ganging up on him. Don't remember if they killed him.
[04:53:53] <causative_> just because someone has mental issues is not to dismiss them as a person
[04:54:01] <Bakunin> no judgment or begrudging, just observing
[04:54:13] <Bakunin> absolutely, agreed.  I support their self-care
[04:54:35] <Bakunin> just saying, from a very long view of cradle to grave... some of that seems excessive in some individuals.
[04:54:43] <Bakunin> and yes perhaps they need it
[04:56:38] <Ungwelian> meditation (n.)
[04:56:39] <Ungwelian> c. 1200, meditacioun, "contemplation; devout preoccupation; private devotions, prayer," from Old French meditacion "thought, reflection, study," and directly from Latin meditationem (nominative meditatio) "a thinking over, meditation," noun of action from past-participle stem of meditari "to meditate, think over, reflect, consider,"
[04:57:13] <Ungwelian> That sense has somehow changed into the opposite: sit with an empty mind.
[04:58:36] <causative_> there are many things called meditation, not all about sitting with an empty mind
[04:59:02] <causative_> meditation can involve visualization, or about watching your mental processes rather than trying to clear them
[04:59:24] <causative_> English doesn't really have a better word for all those kinds of private mental exercises
[04:59:31] <Ungwelian> Yeah, that's it. Structured practises.
[04:59:49] <Ungwelian> Why would any of that be needed for a free mind?
[05:00:03] <causative_> certain Zen "meditation" is not the same as what "meditation" meant in English prior to exposure to Zen
[05:00:10] <causative_> *certainly
[05:00:26] <Ungwelian> Indeed not.
[05:00:42] <causative_> well, you may find that your mind is not free, and the more you introspect the more you may find it is not free
[05:00:49] <causative_> so you want to do something about it
[05:00:55] <causative_> and perhaps meditation can help
[05:01:16] <causative_> you may find that you are driven by desires in ways you don't want to be driven
[05:01:35] <Ungwelian> Yet emotions are part of a healthy psyche.
[05:01:47] <Ungwelian> And not everything is supposed to feel good.
[05:01:49] <causative_> and part of an unhealthy psyche
[05:02:24] <Bakunin> If you are having recurring thoughts which you do not wish to have, you stand a chance at interrupting them
[05:02:37] <Bakunin> emotions the same, but in any context, more difficult to control.
[05:02:43] <Bakunin> They come from our animal days
[05:03:05] <causative_> if you think you have no problem with desires driving you to suffer - if you have no problems with addiction, or impulsive behavior, or jealousy, or fear, or despair - then perhaps you don't need meditation
[05:03:17] <Ungwelian> I think James T. Kirk put it very aptly:
[05:03:18] <causative_> or perhaps you need to introspect more until you find that in fact you do have those problems, you just weren't aware
[05:03:19] <Ungwelian> "Damn it, Bones, you're a doctor. You know that pain and guilt can't be taken away with a wave of a magic wand. They're the things we carry with us, the things that make us who we are. If we lose them, we lose ourselves. I don't want my pain taken away! I need my pain!"
[05:03:42] <causative_> I would agree with you that pain can be beneficial and healthy
[05:03:51] <Bakunin> > or despair
[05:03:52] <causative_> but that's not all it can be
[05:03:54] <Bakunin> ya got me
[05:04:18] <Bakunin> Ungwelian yes
[05:04:24] <causative_> sometimes pain and excess attachment is unhealthy
[05:04:29] <Bakunin> people who wish for eternal life suffer the exact same fallacy
[05:04:36] <Bakunin> without death, no life, no growth
[05:05:02] <Bakunin> How's cold Finland this New Year?
[05:05:51] <Ungwelian> Sure, there are thought structures that can definitely be unhealthy. Like for example anxious thought loops, borderline type attachment, etc.
[05:06:10] <causative_> and meditation can help with that stuff
[05:06:41] <Ungwelian> The way to heal those best, I think, is with a supportive therapist.
[05:06:56] <causative_> that also helps
[05:06:58] <causative_> meditation has proven clinical benefits
[05:07:11] <causative_> your therapist might actually prescribe a course of meditation for you
[05:07:22] <Ungwelian> Observing your thoughts alone, when you have mental problems, can bring about even worse thought loops.
[05:07:41] <Ungwelian> And lead into black / white -salvation type splitting and projecting.
[05:08:04] <causative_> well, it sounds plausible that what you say could be true, so the next thing to do would be go out and test it scientifically
[05:08:12] <causative_> and the science says meditation is beneficial
[05:08:36] <Ungwelian> A religious guru, or a Buddhist master, is usually not a person who takes responsibility of people with mental problems.
[05:09:04] <Ungwelian> They retreat from the world, or grow riches.
[05:09:07] <causative_> I know someone whose therapist prescribed her meditation
[05:09:17] <Ungwelian> Yeah, it's very popular nowadays.
[05:10:07] <Ungwelian> There's also studies that meditation can be harmful.
[05:10:30] <Ungwelian> IIRR, it was about transcendental meditation.
[05:10:45] <sweetsymph> In what ways did they say it could be harmful?
[05:13:08] <causative_> here's how I understand meditation.  Most of the time, you have "tensed" a lot of mental muscles, stopping you from thinking in certain ways that you are afraid of or that are painful.  Meditation is about relaxing those barriers, seeing how your mind really is when you aren't ignoring half of it
[05:13:34] <Bakunin> Ungwelian, most of a guru's flock has a brain worm
[05:13:58] <Bakunin> remember, all gurus are bad
[05:14:13] <Ungwelian> :)
[05:14:25] <Ungwelian> One great book I read about it was "After the Ecstacy, the Laundry".
[05:14:32] <Bakunin> I helped deprogram some people from the Beatles cult
[05:14:48] <Bakunin> yeah so did a guru I knew
[05:14:51] <Bakunin> lol
[05:15:02] <Bakunin> she talked about loving that a lot
[05:15:07] <Bakunin> then she went off the fuckin rails
[05:15:28] <Bakunin> have you seen the sendup by Louie Theroux?

[05:17:45] <Bakunin> first up is Osho
[05:17:53] <Bakunin> then he hears about the real deal, Amma
[05:18:02] <Bakunin> but gets sucked into a couple side cults
[05:18:33] <Bakunin> All in India.  He meets an american physicist who's just completely captured by this guy who claims he can manifest jewels and money.
[05:18:38] <causative_> you don't need a cult to meditate
[05:19:14] <Bakunin> sure, but I was picking up on Ung's comment about gurus, and yours about not being mentally ill
[05:19:19] <Bakunin> these people clearly are mental :)
[05:19:20] <sweetsymph> Many have definitely tried to capitalise on meditation gaining popularity, 101 apps for it, listen to my voice and close your eyes, relax all the muscles in your body, if you have thought observe them let them come and go, listen to thr sounds around you, the wind blowing, birds,
[05:19:22] <Ungwelian> There's an additional one: https://www.insider.com/why-meditation-can-be-bad-2018-3
[05:19:22] <ro-bot-o> [url] Why Meditation Can Be Bad for You | www.insider.com
[05:19:38] <Ungwelian> sweetsymph, definitely.
[05:19:54] <sweetsymph> And market it as an answer
[05:20:01] <sweetsymph> Hmm,
[05:20:38] <causative_> I'm skeptical about these negative claims, the thing is that when you meditate you discover new things about yourself and this may be upsetting
[05:20:52] <causative_> that might come out as a negative on a questionnaire, but it's not a negative
[05:20:58] <Ungwelian> Bakunin, yeah, that's one of the points why I think many of the Western members in the movement are such, because they're not familiar with religious practises in depth.
[05:21:15] <causative_> being upset with how things are is part of the process of discovery
[05:21:37] <Ungwelian> So many people hate Christianity because hating Christianity is cool and proselytizers are annoying.
[05:22:05] <Ungwelian> Few know of e.g. Christian mysticism.
[05:22:14] <Bakunin> "hallucinations, panic, a total loss of motivation, and the re-living of traumatic memories."
[05:22:23] <Bakunin> im into the hallucinations :)
[05:22:34] <Bakunin> ive experienced auditory ones, like schizoaffective
[05:22:44] <Bakunin> this was during intense physical meditation tho
[05:22:59] <Bakunin> chi gung / war mind
[05:24:39] <Bakunin> Ungwelian if you watch that, I'd love to hear what you think.  I enjoyed the fails of the gurus quite a lot
[05:25:00] <Bakunin> one of them responsible for the first biological terror attack on US soil, despite being set up with his cult by the FBI :)
[05:27:00] <Ungwelian> Exotic Eastern religion has become a HUGE business.
[05:27:16] <Ungwelian> Bakunin, thanks for the video, I might watch it :)
[05:27:46] <Bakunin> he just asks sincere questions, and gets the biggest loads of bullshit :)
[05:28:23] <Ungwelian> For example, yoga. You have luxury yoga mattresses, yoga books, yoga courses, yoga masters, yoga clothes, yoga dieticians, so on and so on.
[05:28:34] <Ungwelian> Yoga shoes.
[05:28:48] <Ungwelian> Even yoga rooms for a house.

[05:32:00] <Ungwelian> Yeah :D
[05:32:13] <Bakunin> yeah you're entirely too blinded by the western capitalist thing
[05:32:26] <Bakunin> i agree with the critique, and yes it / cults are big biz
[05:32:28] <Bakunin> no arg on that
[05:32:37] <Bakunin> just that, that's how the west does ******anything******
[05:32:48] <Bakunin> in the US it's illegal to feed starving people
[05:32:52] <Bakunin> just for a reminder
[05:33:17] <Bakunin> they install spikes on the ground and any horizontal surface so the homeless cannot sit or sleep
[05:33:21] <Ungwelian> And all this stuff also works as status symbols for the new, "enlightened" you.
[05:33:38] <Bakunin> yes but people are cattle and 90% of this planet are useless eaters
[05:33:52] <Bakunin> should not reproduce, should decimate global population
[05:33:53] <Bakunin> wont
[05:34:14] <Bakunin> so, get in line for the shitty fast food, with a diesel engine idling
[05:34:25] <Bakunin> and a bumper sticker that makes you feel proud to virtue signal
[05:34:32] <Bakunin> something like "FUCK CANCER!"

[06:03:32] <Ungwelian> Was amazing to notice how much energy is spent just by talking.
[06:04:21] <Ungwelian> But of course, you still usually have to act in the world. Attending lectures in uni was a bit peculiar, so was ordering food.

[07:01:39] <Delf> What's the trolley problem about, morality?
[07:03:14] <causative_> yes
[07:03:48] <Delf> Lucky you... I don't have that problem :)
[07:04:04] <Bakunin> howling at this https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FH-iXiAXMAEpvMu.jpg
[07:04:45] <causative_> it's accurate
[07:04:55] <Delf> That's most likely indeed
[07:05:05] <causative_> the one making the decisions is going to be someone with wealth and power, and he's going to decide in favor of his pals who also have wealth and power
[07:05:12] <Bakunin> Parf where'd you fuck off to?
[07:05:20] <Bakunin> how did we lose you after that amazing opener
[07:05:24] <Bakunin> does my breath stink
[07:05:41] <Delf> He'd probably let you know if that was it
[07:06:03] <Bakunin> causative_ yes, unfortunately
[07:06:37] <Bakunin>  <Parf> COME ON OUT, YOU
[07:06:51] <Delf> Wealth and power, when it comes to money is an inherent problem. We can transfer knowledge, seeds for agriculture and such, but money... we can't plant.
[07:07:37] <Delf> What is worse is that those without money... worship money more than those who have most of it.
[07:09:09] <Delf> I've probably said this thousand times before, I'll repeat. Money is far too expensive to have anything to do with, as a society.
[07:12:51] <amigojapan> Delf: money started out as a simple tool for trade
[07:14:13] <Delf> I would consider it somewhat innocent then. But by now, it has ammased tremendous amount of guilt and so its far from innocent.
[07:15:05] <Delf> Like religions, they do not adapt to environmental changes such as sciences, tech, knowledge, lifestyle etc...
[07:15:29] <Delf> Some do a lot to impede our evolution
[07:16:28] <Delf> The more money you have, the less human I consider you, depending on your usage of the money
[07:17:01] <amigojapan> Mostly I only buy food and pay rent
[07:17:12] <Delf> So the day Ungwelian wins the lottery... I'll start to despise him
[07:18:34] <Delf> From what I've gathered, you qualify as human, amigojapan. Even if you could afford an EV :P
[07:19:40] <amigojapan> Thanks delf
[07:20:17] <Delf> It wasn't a compliment, mate. It was an insult! :P
[07:20:35] <amigojapan> HMmm then I don't get it
[07:20:49] <Delf> I'm pulling your leg :) It wasn't an insult
[07:21:10] <amigojapan> Ah ok :)
[07:21:40] <Delf> For me, it is both honorable and dishonorable. A compliment and an insult, for me to be human
[07:21:59] <Delf> But when it comes to others, I consider it a compliment and honorable, to be human
[07:25:53] <amigojapan> Delf: I don't think there is anything else I can be. Maybe some people are human but behave like animals
[07:26:04] <Delf> It's a human quality to want to remain human, whatever the fuck that might be. And it's also a human quality to want to evolve beyond human... but this quality comes in much more scarce quantities
[07:26:36] <Delf> You could be an advanced robot, who is unaware of it being a robot
[07:27:04] <Delf> I'm not saying you are now, just stating the possibility

[11:28:14] <Delf> Lets not
[11:28:25] <arryana> morning, delf.
[11:28:34] <Delf> Good morning to you too
[11:29:31] <arryana> 45 minutes to sunrise.
[11:29:39] <arryana> i'll be glad when the days are longer.
[11:30:35] <Delf> Lets not wait for that to be glad
[11:31:57] <Delf> 50/50. Take 50% of the joy in the now for when it'll be brighter longer and take the rest of joy after
[11:32:01] <arryana> it isn't a zero sum thing.  there are other things to be glad for in the meantime.
[11:32:06] <arryana> haha
[11:32:11] <arryana> nah, i'm not that sort of person.
[11:32:31] <Delf> No? I take great joy for accomplishments I've yet to make :D
[11:32:34] <arryana> to me, that'd cheapen the delight.
[11:33:02] <arryana> i can be satisfied with progress, but i wouldn't take joy in an accomplishment i haven't achieved.
[11:33:18] <Delf> I can't help it! I just can't wait!
[11:33:22] <arryana> haha
[11:35:40] <Delf> I'm all for win win solutions. Eat and keep the cake. I know it's half as good advice to give but it works for me
[11:35:41] <arryana> i guess age helps in that regard.  longer term efforts don't seem so onerous.
[11:35:57] <arryana> ah, to me a false win is not a win.
[11:36:07] <arryana> but enjoy what works for you.
[11:36:39] <Delf> I give away half eaten cakes...
[11:39:44] <arryana> fortunately i'm a chef, and can make my own.
[11:40:11] <arryana> in fact, today i've got pears that need using up, so there will be a mulled red wine pear tart this evening
[11:40:33] <Delf> False wins feels like lose
[11:41:00] <arryana> i seem to define my world a lot less in win/lose categories than you do.
[11:41:26] <Delf> Yes, it's more of an adventure for you. For me it's a just a sick win/lose game
[11:41:48] <arryana> you can always choose different.
[11:42:11] <Delf> That would destroy me utterly, to the core of my being
[11:42:37] <arryana> haha.  i think you'd survive it.  you'd just be someone new on the other side.
[11:43:11] <Delf> I might survive it for a little while but others around me certainly might not
[11:43:36] <arryana> this was a thing i learned when i lived in a medical rehab hospital for a while.  most people think, 'if i was paralyzed i wouldn't want to live anymore'.  but the reality is, the vast majority find they cope.  people tell themselves they wouldn't so they don't have to believe they can change.
[11:43:37] <Delf> It's not worth to risk it to get the biscuit
[11:44:07] <arryana> it's a way of feeling safe from a reality they don't want to believe could happen.
[11:44:23] <Delf> If I woke up tomorrow without limbs i'd laugh my ass off (assuming I still have that part)
[11:44:30] <arryana> but when/if it does, they get over themselves and find life is just... life.  however you have to live it.
[11:45:15] <arryana> funny that you're more willing to give up your limbs than your world view.
[11:45:54] <arryana> wouldn't being limbless limit your autonomy?  i thought i understood you saying that's the basis of your goal.
[11:46:02] <arryana> and your wish for humanity
[11:46:44] <Delf> It's a good thing
[11:47:14] <Delf> It's better I lose my limbs than become dangerous for others than keep my limbs and become dangerous for others
[11:47:35] <arryana> that's one way to look at it.
[11:47:55] <Delf> Got to be pragmatic, right
[11:48:08] <arryana> though i personally find it hard to believe that you taking a more balanced world view would be dangerous to anyone.
[11:48:43] <Delf> The best part of it is that you don't even have to believe, even if you found it extremely easy to
[11:49:21] <arryana> nope.  i only invest in the beliefs of the people closest to me.
[11:49:50] <Delf> That's one way to filter people off I suppose
[11:50:34] * arryana shrugs
[11:50:46] <Delf> I try to stay as simple as I can as it's important for me given the added complexity I have, compared to others
[11:51:19] <arryana> people are entitled to their beliefs.  but it's nothing to me unless it directly impacts my life.  and that's only true of the people whose lives are deeply entangled with my own.
[11:52:04] <Delf> But your life and your beliefs gets affected by the beliefs of others, don't they?
[11:52:23] <Delf> To some extent, even if you don't share meal with them
[11:52:32] <arryana> only the people closest to me.  the idea that it's otherwise is why there are so many 'karens' these days, telling other people how to live.
[11:56:39] <Delf> Some random stranger appears, magically, from no where that can only be explained scientifically as the big bang. Asks you a question tells you something, that has profound effects on you, the way you view life and what you believed life to be. No?
[11:57:21] <Delf> I'm not saying it's happening every hour
[11:57:54] <arryana> i don't think i understand your example.
[11:57:59] <arryana> can people say things which teach
[11:58:00] <arryana> ?
[11:58:23] <arryana> absolutely.  but taking every statement and every claim everyone else holds as doctrine is just pointless.
[11:58:36] <Delf> They can say something... about something you already know but you learn to see things from another perspective and that can be literally life-changing
[11:58:56] <Delf> Of course, that's probably not easy either :P
[11:59:21] <arryana> that's me learning from what someone says, not someone changing my beliefs with their own convictions.
[12:00:11] <Delf> Hard to tell what others are up to :P
[12:00:43] <arryana> other people don't impose any more than you choose to let them.
[12:01:26] <I_Am_M00t> oh yeah? haha, is that why there's misinformation everywhere?
[12:01:41] <arryana> if people choose to believe things without basis, that's their choice, yes.
[12:02:06] <arryana> just because there -are- flat earthers doesn't mean i automatically believe the earth is flat.  that's silly.
[12:02:59] <Delf> You automatically belief there are flat earthers. What if they're not? They cold be there just for the noise... preventing us from seeing the bigger picture
[12:03:31] <I_Am_M00t> people impose beliefs all the time, it's not a matter of letting them
[12:03:33] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[12:03:44] <I_Am_M00t> and it affects you, whether you like it or not
[12:04:02] <arryana> haha, tell yourself that if you like.
[12:04:16] <I_Am_M00t> unless you're filthy rich and live in some self-sustaining island
[12:04:32] <Delf> That's just disgusting, not playing with the other kids.
[12:05:15] <arryana> that's a big leap, from not embracing everyone else's idiocies to 'not playing with the other kids'
[12:05:21] <arryana> there's a lot of latitude between those positions.
[12:05:46] <Delf> There's a high chance I might not follow. Trying to keep things simple
[12:05:52] <arryana> okay.
[12:05:55] * arryana thinks
[12:05:56] <Delf> Polarizing works best for me
[12:06:08] <arryana> i'm not so sure it does work for you.
[12:06:37] <Delf> But it has so far?
[12:06:39] <arryana> it may be comfortable, but i certainly wouldn't trade my view for yours.
[12:06:47] * arryana shrugs
[12:07:00] <arryana> that'd be one of the things i'm not invested in.
[12:07:08] <Delf> Trading views?
[12:07:12] <arryana> take irc, if you want a more concrete example.
[12:07:41] <arryana> i'm here to enjoy the people i find interesting, or pleasant, or creative.  the people i find unpleasant i /ignore.
[12:07:54] <Delf> You wouldn't even trade views with me not even for a minute or less?
[12:07:58] <arryana> so they have no impact on me, but they're free to do or believe whatever it is that works for them.
[12:08:12] <arryana> they just don't have my attention, time, or investment.
[12:08:20] <arryana> hm.  i don't see why i would.
[12:08:26] <Delf> That's too much of a compliment to give, to someone you barely know
[12:08:35] <arryana> there's no advantage to it for either of us, so far as i can see
[12:08:56] <dispersed> we need buttons here to communicate
[12:09:26] <dispersed> bout 20 buttons for the abc of our basic needs and wants
[12:09:26] <Delf> I think there's great advantage, at least from me. I get to understand how you view things
[12:09:48] <arryana> you'd only understand what you already know.
[12:10:05] <Delf> But I learn also
[12:10:08] <arryana> much like giving your perspective to a six year old, they'd still only understand the things they have context and maturity for,.
[12:10:20] <arryana> they might remember some things and learn from them later, sure
[12:10:23] <arryana> but they might do that anywya
[12:11:15] <Delf> Beliefs are like tools
[12:11:27] <Delf> I can borrow your tools, if you'd let me
[12:11:55] <arryana> i give the people closest to me the option to learn to have whatever tools i have learned myself.
[12:12:00] <arryana> but giving them to anyone, nope.
[12:12:20] <Delf> I'll give them back, I promise
[12:12:31] <arryana> you'd have to ask someone else.  that's not how i work.
[12:12:50] <Delf> Someone else! Can I has your tools?
[12:13:25] <arryana> i mean, sure, you could take my knitting needles.  does that mean you magically know how to knit?
[12:13:35] <arryana> so why would i give them to you?
[12:13:37] <Delf> Not those tools, your beliefs
[12:13:48] <arryana> same thing.
[12:14:01] <arryana> you're the one asserting that they're the same, 'beliefs are like tools'
[12:14:09] <Delf> Not the same, but similar
[12:14:18] <arryana> so my point stands.
[12:14:41] <arryana> my beliefs are based on my experiences and results.  they'd do you no good as anything other than perspective on a different outlook.
[12:14:48] <arryana> and you can get that without me handing it to you.
[12:15:24] <Delf> But my beliefs can be based on others' experiences and results
[12:15:32] *** foxbox is now known as cammy
[12:15:41] *** cammy is now known as foxbox
[12:16:08] <Delf> What you believe, matters, at least to me
[12:16:19] <Delf> Even if what I believe, doesn't matter to you
[12:19:04] <Delf> I don't work with traditional beliefs, those regarding reality, truth and the stuff. They're too sticky and problematic for me. I work with assumptions. If I ever say I believe, I'm actually saying I assume.
[12:19:23] <Delf> They cause conflicts
[12:19:25] <arryana> it'll be interesting to see how that works out for you
[12:19:42] <Delf> How what works for me? Working with assumptions?
[12:21:06] <Delf> Probably not the way you'd expect
[12:22:53] <arryana> i don't expect anything one way or the other
[12:23:09] <Delf> What do you imagine would be interesting?
[12:23:51] <arryana> i don't understand your question
[12:24:13] <Delf> I'm referring to @ "it'll be interesting to see how that works out for you"
[12:24:54] <arryana> i mean, it isn't a viewpoint i hold, and not one i'd choose to hold, so however it works out for you will be an education.
[12:25:21] <arryana> i'd say much the same thing to someone who decides to start an avalanche.
[12:25:43] <Delf> Which viewpoint are you referring to?
[12:25:48] <arryana> i've never personally seen one started, but i wouldn't choose to do it myself.  so i'd watch with interest, from a distance
[12:26:10] <arryana> <Delf> I don't work with traditional beliefs, those regarding reality, truth and the stuff. They're too sticky and problematic for me. I work with assumptions. If I ever say I believe, I'm actually saying I assume.
[12:26:24] <Delf> That's a too dangerous thing to do, could cause great damage to others
[12:27:16] <arryana> yeah, assumptions are much the same to me.
[12:27:42] <Delf> Did you pick that example specifically because of the dangers it involves?
[12:27:43] <arryana> there are times it's necessary to act on assumptions, when there's need to act and insufficient fact.  but those times are rare and risky
[12:27:48] <arryana> yes.

[12:29:27] <Delf> What're the dangers of the viewpoint I have?
[12:29:35] * arryana shrugs
[12:29:51] <arryana> the fellow who taught me most of what i know about auto mechanics had a phrase.
[12:30:02] <arryana> 'in theory, there is no difference between theory and practice.  in practice, there is'
[12:30:04] <arryana> and he was right.
[12:30:27] <arryana> acting on assumptions is acting on theory.  acting on facts is acting on practice.
[12:30:57] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[12:30:59] <Delf> That's just replacing the word belief with the word assumptions. That's indeed, dangerous
[12:31:19] <arryana> belief is an assumption.  fact is belief with concrete proof.
[12:31:19] <Delf> That's not what I'm doing. I'm doing the ACTUAL practical WORK here. I'm assuming, NOT believing
[12:31:28] <pussipupu> It's a useful aphorism but once it's incorporated into your theory it's not true :p
[12:31:30] * arryana shrugs
[12:31:35] <arryana> hahah, pussipupu
[12:31:40] <arryana> he mentioned that too
[12:31:48] <arryana> but this is already getting convoluted enough
[12:31:53] * arryana pushes tea to pussipupu
[12:31:56] <arryana> how was your new year
[12:31:57] <arryana> ?
[12:32:08] <arryana> ooh, i get to hang my new calendar today

[12:33:37] <Delf> You just launched an orbital nuclear vacuum imploding missile at me... my viewpoint being as dangerous as an avalanche and not telling me their similarities
[12:33:58] <I_Am_M00t> i don't understand this convo
[12:34:06] <pussipupu> pretty good, cheese, biscuits, a film, various booze happened, yours?
[12:34:09] <Delf> That's because you're not in it, I_Am_M00t!
[12:35:02] <arryana> it was quiet, but lovely.  we put on the fake fire in the conservatory, had cheese, crackers, fruit, roasted chestnuts, and prosecco.
[12:35:45] <arryana> well, delf, you told me yesterday that you've never seen a happy, fulfilled, decent life in anyone around you, and don't have one yourself.
[12:36:00] <arryana> perhaps this is because your viewpoint is an avalanche.
[12:36:34] <Delf> No it's not. It's because I as an individual person suck shit. It's got nothing to do with my viewpoint
[12:37:44] * arryana shrugs
[12:37:51] <Delf> I will clarify, what I meant by what I said yesterday is that... what makes others happy, fulfilled, decent meaningful life for others... isn't for me
[12:37:58] <arryana> i don't agree.  but that's just my opinion.
[12:38:09] *** Quits: econo (uid147250@user/econo) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[12:38:26] <arryana> changing your viewpoint will change you as a person.

[12:38:38] <arryana> i have no idea.
[12:38:45] <arryana> i don't know you well enough to say.
[12:38:46] <Delf> Right! I knew that :P
[12:39:23] <arryana> but your viewpoint does very much determine who you are.  and changing it would change how much you 'suck shit'

[12:39:36] <Delf> Hmm...
[12:39:59] <Delf> But my viewpoint is good, even if I suck shit. Actually it'll be the same if I just simply didn't suck shit
[12:40:42] <Delf> What's wrong with my viewpoint? Don't spare my feelings
[12:40:52] <Delf> I can take it. I'm sucking shit already
[12:42:28] <arryana> you're going to have to work that one out for yourself.  i'm not a shrink, nor a guru.
[12:42:41] <Delf> For everyone reading this, don't suck shit, it's not good. I don't do it, you shouldn't either. I'm just pretending to be sucking shit. I'd never.
[12:43:09] <arryana> i already have more than enough responsibilities.
[12:43:11] <Delf> It's a simple question mate. You specifically compared it with an avalanche because of the dangers involved
[12:43:23] <Delf> I won't add to them
[12:43:42] <arryana> like i said, you need to work out your own viewpoint yourself.
[12:44:01] <arryana> you can try to understand mine, if that suits you, but i won't analyze yours for you.
[12:44:16] <Delf> That's exactly what I did. I transitioned from believing to assuming. It was a natural consequence after having understood the dangers of believing, reality and truth
[12:46:49] <Delf> That is sound advice btw, golden the least to say
[12:50:28] <Delf> I have tremendous amounts of happiness, fulfilment and meaning to my life. I'd say the last part is superior to most people's but that's probably just the consequence of me being able to afford to not worry about things that worry people most, work, job, money, rent, future etc
[12:51:03] <arryana> it's nice that you're happy.
[12:51:35] <arryana> i can't speak for anyone else, but i love my job.
[12:52:55] <arryana> the future is not something i overly concern myself with, as the vicissitudes of life often make their own demands that nobody could see coming.
[12:53:15] * Delf is nobody
[12:54:11] <arryana> as to money, the concerns there vary by year.  when i had less than i needed, there were difficulties, to be sure, but they weren't insurmountable.  having more than i need requires thought as to the best ways to share the excess.
[12:54:39] <arryana> that can occasionally create its own issues.  also surmountable.
[12:56:10] <Delf> Indeed
[12:59:38] <Delf> I have revised my definitions, they're perfectly clear! But it seems that is only the case if one is... working with assumptions and not reality. Like myself
[13:00:36] <arryana> and that's totally your option.  it wouldn't work for me personally, though.
[13:02:04] <Delf> That's exactly my point
[13:02:40] <Delf> It wouldn't work for most people actually. You might consider that good thing, given I'm the mentally disabled one
[13:03:10] <arryana> perhaps it isn't working for you, then, either.
[13:04:12] <Delf> Why would you say that?
[13:04:49] * arryana is perplexed as to what isn't clear
[13:04:50] <I_Am_M00t> different strokes for different folks
[13:07:00] <Delf> Hmm?
[13:07:42] <Delf> Come on mate. It's not like I'm not trying. I've missed something and I'm asking for a hand here, help me out, will you?
[13:07:54] <I_Am_M00t> what, me?
[13:07:57] <Delf> Anyone!
[13:08:22] <I_Am_M00t> lol, i'm just saying, if something's working for you, the fine... it works
[13:08:29] <arryana> i'm not at all sure what you're asking.
[13:08:38] <I_Am_M00t> you do you, i'll do me
[13:09:13] <Delf> You said, perhaps it isn't working for me either. And I asked why you'd say that?
[13:10:05] <arryana> you've already said that you 'suck shit' and are 'mentally disabled'.  at least one of those things could be potentially changed by altering your viewpoint.

[14:22:02] <sweetsymphony> everyone should know every time mwsb bans a man here for being a bit sexist or rude, he himself is one of the most sexist rude person on this network, he tries to force people to allow others to say sexually harassing comments like 'ever sucked a cock for anything your parents wouldn't approve of" and say things that make it look like they take cocaine. He is abusive if they try to say they don't want to take it and
[14:22:02] <sweetsymphony> it upsets them. He says things like, "have you ever been railed by an entire foot ball team?' he gangs up together in a group continually saying things to make it look like i took and dealt cocaine and got railed by a football team long after i asked those kinds of comments to stop while i was saying i was crying and all the time him laughing.

[14:28:49] <Delf> I have great capacity for humor but I don't see whats funny here
[14:29:30] <arryana> just how on-topic that example was
[14:30:13] <arryana> i have no issue with symphony, but i don't personally think ranting about someone is useful, they could have just /ignored.
[14:30:21] <arryana> long, long before getting so wound up.
[14:30:24] <Delf> We can solve it. We can make it on-topic by philosophizing about different aspects of it.

[14:31:41] <arryana> does it need solving?
[14:33:26] <Delf> It might
[14:33:27] <arryana> as i said yesterday, people are different to different people.  while i will take someone's opinion of someone else under advisement, it does not determine my own opinion of them

[14:37:59] <Delf> The thin ice represents you even having an opinion of me, let alone what it would be
[14:38:48] <arryana> i don't know you well enough to have much of an opinion
[14:39:27] <Delf> See see... I knew that
[14:39:57] <arryana> your perspectives are very foreign to my own, and often appear somewhat contradictory to me.  so i wouldn't be in a position to have a concrete opinion.
[14:40:33] <arryana> as to symphony's... comments.. i tend to be dismissive of any statement in the neighborhood of 'i don't like this person so nobody else should either'.
[14:41:31] <Delf> Could also be like "I got raped by this person, careful not to get raped". Something like a warning
[14:42:14] <arryana> i fail to see how there's any physical threat from text in a chat room

[14:44:44] <Delf> So, in my defense, as a counterattack, to you reply regarding my opinion. I don't say things that're pointless, I'm not an assholes (mean) and I'm also not not interesting. Which is why I'm not on your ignore list. That does say much, doesn't it?

[14:50:24] <arryana> i'd even go further and say there are two levels of people on my /ignore list.  there's the few who made enough of an impression that i add them immediately when i change software or get a new machine, and the rest, who i add when their behavior reminds me that they're not worth my attention.
[14:50:40] <arryana> most of those i don't recall until they draw my attention with some stupidity or other

[16:02:35] <arryana> i don't see the humor in it.
[16:02:35] <Delf> It's not even something to appreciate me for
[16:02:46] <arryana> i don't.  so there's no joke.
[16:02:49] <arryana> it's just a fact.
[16:02:53] <Delf> The joke is me pretending to wanting to be appreciated for basically nothing
[16:03:01] * arryana rolls her eyes
[16:03:04] <arryana> that's just neuroris.
[16:03:45] <arryana> i don't go down other people's emotional rabbit holes of that sort.
[16:04:08] <Delf> Had to look up the word. I don't have it. See now it's not fun anymore, because now I'm thinking that there's people who are actually like that
[16:05:05] <Delf> That's a good thing. People can get cranky real quick
[16:08:34] <Delf> Neurosis may be defined simply as a "poor ability to adapt to one's environment, an inability to change one's life patterns, and the inability to develop a richer, more complex, more satisfying personality."
[16:08:52] <Delf> It would seem I answered prematurely, my bad.
[16:11:26] <Delf> Actually, I don't know if I qualify for this. Sure people consider me misfit but I'm not trying to blend into my environment. But the other two parts I excelled at, specially the last one where I went full on batshit at
[16:12:44] <Delf> So no, I'm not having neurosis. Can you imagine yourself, wanting to be appreciated for something that's not even something to be appreciated for?
[16:13:40] <Delf> There's two parts to that joke. First being, you want to be appreciated. The idea should make you laugh. And then the other part is... not even something to be appreciated for.
[16:22:43] <Delf> There is logic to ALL of my jokes, every single one of them. It doesn't require keys but... The timing can be severely inappropriate because of well.. that's part of what makes them funny to me
[16:28:35] <Delf> Even my closest friends don't always get it when I'm joking, until I explain it to them so it's not you... it's me, I'm well aware of it

[16:48:03] <Delf> I_Am_M00t: The reason you don't understand the conversation is because one thing leads to another. There are way to many differences that would require way much time to clear even some of them, given the their deep nature
[16:49:13] <I_Am_M00t> i think the reason is because it's gibberish
[16:50:01] <Delf> That tends to happen when I throw in jokes here and there in the middle of it
[16:51:11] <Delf> Would you say all of it is gibberish?
[16:51:26] <I_Am_M00t> i will write some gibberish too
[16:52:07] <I_Am_M00t> *clear throat* The hair of my thoughts tickles the mind of oceans.
[16:52:29] <I_Am_M00t> If an apple is a thought, and you are the seeds of the apple, we can co-exist.
[16:52:45] <I_Am_M00t> i am therefore your emperor
[16:53:03] <Delf> Interesting...
[16:53:14] <I_Am_M00t> of course
[16:53:38] <I_Am_M00t> that's how you type, because i am in you, as the seed is in the apple.
[16:54:17] <Delf> I did not mean to insult your intelligence
[16:54:19] <I_Am_M00t> I am controlling your fingers, like DNA controls your thoughts.
[16:55:29] <I_Am_M00t> Who are you insulting? You can only insult yourself, anything you say to others, you say to yourself.
[16:55:47] <Henry151> I can type a lot of gibberish too.
[16:55:54] <Henry151> I like to talk a lot. Even when my voice is not heard, by me or others. Speak enough, frequently enough, and you can be confident that not every body will choose to read.
[16:56:30] <Henry151> Nowadays we may even be aware that some body or another body may not hear us, but we know that we may be heard despite our much speaking, unlike the heathen do. Therefore pray ye, if you like to and it is your will, you may, maybe, if you do, it shall be. I sure will.
[16:56:35] <I_Am_M00t> What does it mean to write, isn't chocolate the same as the person who eats it?
[16:58:29] <Delf> Not understanding what I'm saying a whole different thing that actually saying that I'm talking nonsense/gibberish
[16:58:49] <I_Am_M00t> Who is it who doesn't understand? The thought that the other exists is just a thought, it is all you.
[16:59:03] <I_Am_M00t> There is no nonsense, only no sense.
[16:59:28] <I_Am_M00t> But if I am using my senses to read from the environment, there is a sense... therefore there is understanding.
[17:00:13] <I_Am_M00t> hmm, I could publish a book
[17:00:17] <Henry151> Would that it were only so, if I surely did say, shoulda, woulda, coulda had, time to speak all day.
[17:00:41] <Delf> Geez... this devolved real fast
[17:00:48] <Henry151> If I had only could have had, another time would be.
[17:08:28] <dispersed> interestingly, buddha rhymes with all of the conditionals
[17:08:53] <dispersed> I buddha noticed.

[21:25:54] <krb> almost biys :)
[21:26:15] <biys> and how uh...  as a result of using a racial slur "playfully" amongst hisfriends in his back yard
[21:26:24] <biys> he suffered some significanty backlash
[21:26:57] <biys> and his best selling album of 2021
[21:27:29] <biys> cbc radio was talking about it earlier today
[21:27:35] <biys> what was his name
[21:27:59] <biys> the black comedian with the netflix specials that was recently deplatformed has said "if this is what being deplatformed is i love it"
[21:28:13] <biys> same with the white guy who masterbated in front of female stars and was deplatformed
[21:28:42] <biys> it seems like cancel culture doesn't necessaarily have to inflict any kind of negative result
[21:28:49] <biys> it can actually boost some peopels careers
[21:28:53] <biys> what do you think about that?
[21:34:03] <audrey> biys: I haven´t heard of Morgan Wallens
[21:34:43] <audrey> I mean, «cancelling» a person who was rich and famous to begin with doesn´t really do much because the person has the means to continue sustaining themselves
[21:35:15] <audrey> The real issue with «cancellation» is when nobodies lose their jobs because someone decided to dig up kompromat or whatever as part of a personal vendetta
[21:36:18] <audrey> I have to laugh at the attempts to «cancel» JK Rowling, for example, because she´s so rich she can just ignore it all and keep living her life. If you´re John Doe and someone digs up an incriminating text message from ten years ago, though, you don´t have that kind of luxury.
[21:37:24] <audrey> (Still scratching my head at all the attempts to paint Rowling as a hater. I´ve read her essays and her public statements. Don´t get why anyone would get so enraged about any of it. But, that´s just me and my old fashioned brain, maybe.)
[21:37:31] <arryana> yeah, i don't get that either.
[21:37:41] <arryana> i don't see what she said that's so appalling.
[21:38:43] <arryana> but maybe i missed whatever it is that's got knickers knotted
[21:39:08] <audrey> I don´t think you did. I just think people are looking for excuses to be offended, frankly.
[21:39:30] <audrey> Either way, biys, before I digress, IDK if that answers your question or not.
[21:39:39] <arryana> i'll probably get eviscerated for the comparison, but if i understood, she at one point referred to genetic women, or some such
[21:39:57] <audrey> to me, both the liberal-left and conservative-right misunderstand the real nature and threat of «cancellation», in different ways
[21:40:02] <arryana> not that she particularly denigrated trans people, just that she noted the genetic difference.
[21:40:32] <arryana> to me that's like someone who's had bone-lengthening surgery being offended because they aren't being called 'genetically tall'
[21:40:46] <arryana> are they tall, sure.  are they women, sure.  but it doesn't magically change their dna.
[21:44:13] <arryana> i guess from my side, which is admittedly genetically female, i don't understand why anyone would want to erase their own history.
[21:46:10] <arryana> however a person finds themselves is valid, insofar as they don't do it at someone else's expense.  i can't imagine denying the road that got them where they are.
[21:46:48] <arryana> maybe i'm just too old to understand

[22:10:53] <audrey> biys: again this seems relevant only if you´re already famous
[22:12:44] <audrey> biys: There was some poor schmuck in the UK recently who got kicked out of an expensive psychology program because he made some comment about biological women, and now he´s in debt/financial straits for basically expressing a private opinion that until very recently was considered completely uncontroversial.
[22:13:19] <audrey> To me, this is where the real challenge lies. John Cleese got called out for making a snide remark about gay people? Well, he´s already loaded with money and his fans will remain his fans.
[22:14:22] <audrey> I´m sure there´s an element of «prestige» to it in certain circles but that´s certainly not the first thing that comes to mind with stories like that.
[22:19:21] <biys> do you think those who aren't already rich and famous should do anything different?
[22:19:25] <biys> should they apologize?
[22:19:31] <biys> should they be unrelenting in their position?
[22:20:18] <audrey> I mean, if my understanding of the dynamics of «cancellation» are correct, then it effectively is a form of mob psychology
[22:20:36] <audrey> And in that case, apologizing will only signal weakness to the mob.
[22:22:05] <audrey> So I think the correct long term, game theory solution would be to hold your ground and attempt to maintain your credibility.
[22:22:25] <audrey> Of course, that´s very easy to say when you´re not under enormous psychological and social pressure to genuflect.
