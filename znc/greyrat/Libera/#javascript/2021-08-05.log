[02:10:01] <entuland> okay, here is a tricky one: is there a non-hacky way to achieve what I want here? https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/3nuq2ka6/ namely, I want to make sure the cursor doesn't change while I'm dragging stuff around
[02:10:29] *** Joins: qswz (~caub@91-175-196-225.subs.proxad.net)
[02:10:32] <entuland> I mean, I have a solution, but if feels very ugly, mainly due to the !important
[02:10:38] <entuland> s/if/it
[02:11:33] <entuland> there may be any number of other elements in the page that require different cursors _while I'm not dragging stuff around_
[02:12:26] <entuland> while I'm dragging, the drag system has full control (only moves a specific element around), and the mouse should retain the "move" cursor anywhere on the page as long as the mouse button is down
[02:12:53] <hassoon> entuland: you want to get rid of the drag cursor ?
[02:13:01] <moldorcoder7> why an observable instance that just do a setinterval(..) still exists after the function is returned ?
[02:13:04] <entuland> no, I want the drag cursor
[02:13:06] <GreenJello> usually with drag/drop you add a massive element that's always under the cursor
[02:13:23] <entuland> yep, unfortunately the element I'm moving is inside a specific viewport
[02:13:29] <hassoon> entuland: you have it already, you want it on the non-draggable area .
[02:13:30] <hassoon> ?
[02:13:46] <entuland> hassoon, I have a solution, I'm looking for a non-hacky one if one exists
[02:13:50] <GreenJello> I can't think of a case where you wouldn't be able to do this
[02:14:01] <hassoon> entuland: but is that what you want ?
[02:14:27] <entuland> sure I can do that, GreenJello, it just feels weird being kinda "forced" to use "!important"
[02:14:36] <entuland> hassoon, that fiddle does already what I want
[02:14:40] <GreenJello> you wouldn't need to
[02:14:53] <entuland> just trying to get rid of the !important
[02:14:59] <hassoon> entuland: meh if you achieved what you want already, then you're all set up
[02:15:02] <GreenJello> if you put the mouse net (or whatever you want to call it) on top of the other elements
[02:15:06] <GreenJello> it should work fine
[02:16:08] *** Joins: comatory (~ondrejsyn@217.11.241.69)
[02:16:09] <entuland> what I'm moving is a large image that has to remain inside of a clipped viewport, to provide a smooth experience I can't confine the mouse "reaction" to just the viewport, and I can't pull the element above / outside of such a viewport
[02:16:32] <entuland> I guess I'll bite the bullet and just use the !important
[02:16:44] <hassoon> !important is not a sin
[02:16:52] <hassoon> you can use it whenever you want
[02:16:59] <entuland> well, somewhat :P
[02:17:05] <GreenJello> that would still work with my suggestion
[02:17:13] <entuland> it still feels bad even knowing that I currently have no alternative
[02:17:16] <GreenJello> but if you prefer your current approach, that's also fine
[02:17:29] <entuland> GreenJello, sorry, I may have failed to understand that different approach
[02:17:52] <hassoon> entuland: you have no alternative and !imprtant does what you want? embrace the !important, no, hug it hard
[02:17:56] <entuland> I'll modify the fiddle to show what I mean better

[04:37:10] <FlorianBad> So this raises some questions.... First, does Google add analytics to all websites? Second, are the 2 others some hacking from some extensions I got?
[04:39:04] <robertmaxrees> "that are not part of the website" - how do you know?
[04:39:08] <sheetjs> you have to add the google analytics script
[04:39:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ if it's a site you control, it's very possible some other script is injecting them to the page.
[04:39:58] <sheetjs> gkatsev can talk more about this
[04:40:15] <sheetjs> iirc videojs used to include a slim version of the google analytics script
[04:40:49] <FlorianBad> robertmaxrees: because the website is minde
[04:41:08] <robertmaxrees> FlorianBad gonna guess that those are bein injected by something else then :)
[04:41:25] <cis> https://3001.scriptcdn.net/code/static/1 is pretty obfuscated, but it looks like more google analytics stuff
[04:41:30] <sheetjs> using the chrome console you should be able to see what is making the request
[04:43:20] <FlorianBad> yeah that was an auto-refresh extension... When I disable it the 3 scripts are gone
[04:43:24] <FlorianBad> damn, I didn't realize
[04:43:28] <robertmaxrees> then there you go.
[04:43:41] <robertmaxrees> sometimes it's 3rd and 4th party injections, too.
[04:43:56] <cis> pagespeed-mod.com looks suspicious
[04:43:56] <FlorianBad> It's nuts... I mean the danger with this is huge!

[06:59:09] <nightKnight2020> Hi im very new to javascript " hopefully this is the right place" I request a json object from my web server but some of the elements on my webpage are referenced by "id" and some by "name" identifier.  For this to work i had 2 separate javascript functions one to update the elements by id and of for elements by name. how can i combine the two
[06:59:09] <nightKnight2020> functions and tell it to ignore any id/names elements that may not exist? https://pastebin.com/hhDKK3N8
[06:59:34] <wroathe> Linkandzelda: I'm not able to see the code, but the call stack at the start of that task shows that the last thing to execute before it enters the shift is drawLines, which executes drawLineToContext in a loop, it looks like
[07:00:02] <wroathe> Linkandzelda: So you may be drawing far more lines than you intended to, and the Chrome may be having a difficult time handling the volume of elements being inserted into the document
[07:00:37] <Linkandzelda> wroathe: that's drawing lines to a canvas, so probably the rendering of the canvas?. the array is probably 300k in length at a guess
[07:00:44] <nightKnight2020> forgive my knowledge but if there is an object key in the json file that dont exist in the html elements then the web console shows error. i need to combine these two scripts and have it ignore any error and update whatever id/names that exist just in the json object key
[07:01:21] <wroathe> Linkandzelda: Try cutting down that array to see if it makes a difference in how long the UI is frozen for.
[07:02:08] <Linkandzelda> wroathe: yes, it does reduce the time. though its drawing a waveform so the more it draws the longer it takes
[07:02:50] <wroathe> Linkandzelda: Well, you know your culprit then. It's been quite a long time since I used the canvas API for anything, and so I won't be able to go deeper on that

[07:21:53] <nightKnight2020> yes. some of the element id attributes are used for form id so i added the name attribute for the javascript function to update valve of element with json object
[07:22:31] <nightKnight2020> but they do not all use name attribute. the elements that dont submit form data use only id attribute and a second javascript function

[07:28:57] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: In some contexts id operates as a name, but the most common use for `id` is just to uniquely identify an element for the purposes of selection
[07:29:08] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: And generally speaking, it's best to avoid IDs unless you have a good reason to add them

[07:29:53] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: The `name` attribute can be thought of as a kind of "key" for the field on a given form object. Read the spec link I posted above for the details.
[07:30:36] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: If all of the fields you need to update from your object's keys are inputs, then associating each key with a `name` attribute is probably the correct approach

[07:40:38] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: So the third object looks like the keys all correspond to fields of a form
[07:40:57] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: I would use `name` attributes there, and not `id` attributes
[07:41:36] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: You can think of `name` as being the unique name for a field in a form object
[07:42:00] <nightKnight2020> im trying to make all the json objects into 1 object and im doing that in c++ but the third object keys correspond to fields of a form and the rest are just global id.

[07:48:32] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: And a group of properties representing an object will have a common ancestor HTML element. I would select that element, and then select all of the elements with a data-name attribute, iterate through those, and store a reference to each element in an object

[07:50:58] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Also, if you don't have data to bind to these elements on page load anyway there's not much point in having them
[07:51:09] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Is all of this HTML static at page load?
[07:52:44] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: If you need to wait to make an AJAX request to have data to actually bind to the elements in your page, I would just serve empty containers, and then handle the element construction in Javascript
[07:52:46] <nightKnight2020> the json functions poll the webserver which is an esp8266 and the server replies with these objects so that i can see the variable on the web page. i liked the input field to populate with the current value o
[07:53:10] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Yup, but do those elements in your HTML document have data when the page initially loads?
[07:53:31] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Or are you just harcoding empty elements like <div id="foo"></div>?
[07:53:39] <nightKnight2020> not until it gets a json object from the server
[07:54:07] <nightKnight2020> none of the elements have any static data except for when i use them as just static names
[07:54:12] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Ok, well, a massive improvement you can make then is to use Javascript to create those elements, instead of writing them in HTML
[07:54:32] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[07:54:34] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Right. The ones that are dynamic don't need to be in the document at page load. You should use JS to create them when you get data
[07:54:46] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: And the benefit then is that you won't need to use `id` or `data-name` at all
[07:54:58] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Because you can store a reference to each created element in an object
[07:55:18] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: Where that object has a key corresponding to the key for that elements data you get back from the ajax request
[07:55:39] <nightKnight2020> this sounds great but i have very limited knowledge in javascript and that sounds like it would require atleast intermediate knowledge\

[08:03:52] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: The key here is that now ralphNodes is an object that has keys that correspond to the keys of the data object you get back, and you can easily locate the HTML element that corresponds to each key, even with a polling setup.

[08:07:50] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: If you add empty HTML elements to your HTML document you then need some way of identifying which element corresponds to which property, and so you have to use IDs, which isn't great and requires you to do lots of selecting. This is far simpler. You just create the element corresponding to each property in a lazy fashion, and then store a reference to it for later
[08:08:16] <wroathe> nightKnight2020: So ralphNodes becomes a mapping of object property -> object property element

[08:51:31] <nightKnight2020> keep in mind the json object returned to the first function now contains the data from the 3rd json object

[13:16:38] <teut> but const means  cant be modified

[13:21:01] <Maxdamantus> The object value is a pointer. The variable still holds the same value (pointer).
[13:21:10] <Maxdamantus> Since you mentioned C, C works the same way there.
[13:21:25] <no_gravity> teut: Javascript is not written in a language. Javascript is a concept. Certain interpreters or compilers might be written in C or any other language. But that does not have an impact on the language Javascript.
[13:22:01] <teut> ya , but the interpreter, compiler etc  is written  in c++/c

[14:10:45] <Maxdamantus> olle: the basic idea of a CSRF token is that the client proves it's able to read a response by relaying back to the server a value that it received.

[15:22:23] <Deneb> I thought all javascript functions linked to a HTML page were stored within the DOM and were therefore accessible?
[15:23:24] <Dorward> Any function defined in the top level scope of a non-module `<script>` element will be a global and, if it is declared with a function declaration or `var`, a property of the `window` object.

[15:26:12] <Dorward> No
[15:26:26] <Deneb> sorry, probably sshould say window.globalfunction()
[15:26:28] <Dorward> Just type its name.
[15:26:57] <Dorward> Maybe there's an error loading the script, or maybe it isn't top level in the script.
[15:27:13] <Dorward> Or maybe its in a frame and your console in not (or vice versa)
[15:27:19] <Deneb> hmm, well that's what I am doing within my function, just using its name. The console log says 'is not defined'
[15:28:17] <Deneb> its not within a fram, but the <script> tags it sits within are within the <body> tags rather then header
[15:31:06] <Deneb> ok, looking within the dom hierarchy in console, it might actually be sitting in a <div>, which is kind of weird since the functions have been put at the end of the body and there is no </div> tag after the <script></script> and before </body>

[16:32:23] <happymeal> but yeah im curious if that counts as a context menu
[16:33:06] <happymeal> i think it does -- if i longpress inside firefox on the phone thats def a context menu :0
[16:33:26] <hassoon> happymeal: at least that's what it does for me, in this web app https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/
[16:33:38] <hassoon> happymeal: if you long-press the code editor, you'll see a context menu
[16:33:56] <hassoon> which only appears when the right click event is triggered in computers
[16:34:13] <hassoon> happymeal: it's a custom context menu that also appears in mobile devices, not even a native one

[20:45:04] <Rockwood_> entuland, o/
[20:45:15] <entuland> o/
[20:45:37] <entuland> now, speaking of real bugs - anyone noticed how the color picker in this page may pick from the wrong coordinates? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color
[20:45:52] <entuland> in my case, I have a secondary monitor placed on the left of the primary one
[20:46:10] <GreenJello> the native color picker is a pain
[20:46:33] <entuland> as I click on the color input and I click on the color picker, it feels like the primary and secondary displays are swapped around
[20:46:58] <entuland> I'll test that on firefox
[20:47:01] <GreenJello> inconsistent across browsers/operating systems, and entirely out of your control
[20:47:46] <entuland> aye, I see that chrome uses a different picker from firefox, this latter one seems to be using the default windows color picker
[20:48:10] <GreenJello> I'd put it in the same category as alert/prompt, where you only use it if you really don't care about the details
[20:48:25] *** Joins: gggp (~gggp@114.245.119.213)
[20:48:34] <gggp> is there yacc for js
[20:48:39] <entuland> yep, for the kind of system I'm creating I can get away with ignoring such inconsistencies
[20:48:49] <GreenJello> gggp, ask google
[20:49:50] <entuland> be kind as google is in a bad mood today
[20:50:22] <Rockwood_> google have lots of answers :D
[20:50:35] <wroathe> GreenJello: That's one of those things where there's a natural tension between how something should work and how it does work that we keep seeing with web development. Over the years we get new browser features that either need CSS to normalize the behavior between browsers, or polyfills to implement the API until it's consistent across browsers. I like the idea of having a native color picker, like i
[20:50:41] <wroathe> like the idea of having native video controls.
[20:51:15] <wroathe> So i'm torn between recommending people don't use it because it's buggy, or recommending that they do use it so that we can put pressure on browser vendors to normalize the behavior
[20:51:31] <entuland> I vouch for the latter
[20:51:44] <entuland> no wait, to vouch isn't the right term
[20:51:46] <entuland> I root?

[20:56:44] <wroathe> In my experience front end developers often overestimate their ability to create alternatives to native controls in Javascript, and they cave to pressure to build a custom control implementation, and it ends up buggier than the native control.

[22:24:02] <banana_> *something is brought up
[22:24:10] <sheetjs> no one *wants* drm
[22:24:27] <sheetjs> no one wants telemetry, that's why it's opt-out rather than opt-in

[22:26:33] <GreenJello> studios won't license content to netflix etc. if they make ripping it too easy, so netflix needs to deliver the content based on the available DRM in the browser (different resolutions), so the user wants a browser with good DRM so they can watch content in high quality
[22:26:38] <cloudbender> My linter says not to use ' new String('') as a constructor
[22:26:45] <sheetjs> why are you using new string?
[22:26:54] <sheetjs> as opposed to just "key 0" "key 1" etc

[22:27:34] <sheetjs> https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-wrappers
[22:27:34] <GreenJello> but why?
[22:28:04] <cloudbender> so that the map keys are references rather than being long-assed path strings
[22:28:10] <sheetjs> you can disable that rule
[22:28:41] <cthulchu> damned dates! hell, okay my folks. .toISOString() switches the time from local to utc...
[22:28:48] <GreenJello> so do { value: 'key 0' } as the key

[22:33:28] <cloudbender> @sheetjs thanks for the linting tip
[22:33:47] <matsaman> they should probably just charge less, and get more money by more people being able to afford the subscriptions

[22:37:15] <banana_> if you have to make buying so convenient that it makes ripping off a pain.
[22:37:19] <ELFrederich> is there something like a tuple in JavaScript?  I'm doing some p5js with my son and I see some "createVector" but that seems p5js specific.  I'm curious about native JS
[22:37:40] <systemfault> banana_: Or simply give canadians (in my case), the same netflix as they have in the US
[22:38:11] <systemfault> ELFrederich: No, tuples in JS are usually represented as "arrays"
[22:38:29] <systemfault> ELFrederich: That's also how typescript represents them
[22:38:43] <pavonia> Do function parameter lists count as tuples?
[22:38:47] <systemfault> const vec3 = [1.0, 0.0, 2.0];
[22:38:53] <wroathe> pavonia: No
[22:39:03] <ELFrederich> systemfault, so I want an array of x,y pairs.  I do "this.whatever = []".  Then I should do something like "this.whatever.push([some_x, some_y])"?
[22:39:16] <systemfault> ELFrederich: Yup
[22:39:18] <wroathe> pavonia: Although you can use the rest operator to get the arguments as an array and that can be viewed as a form of "tuple"
[22:39:27] <banana_> systemfault: yeah but then again watching netflix too much probably isn't conducive to a fulfilled life
[22:39:38] <ELFrederich> systemfault, systemfault, and what happens if I do "this.whatever.push((some_x, some_y))"?
[22:39:56] <banana_> maybe canadians have it better
[22:40:00] <systemfault> ELFrederich: Not sure... maybe it will try to add "some_y" to the array because of the comma operator
[22:40:12] <systemfault> ELFrederich: Just know that it won't work

[22:41:06] <cloudbender> @ELFredrich sorry
[22:41:31] <cloudbender> geez bender read the name ffs
[22:43:56] <ELFrederich> does JS have variable unpacking?  For instance now I want to loop over this array with forEach and be able to use x and y instead of element[0] and element[1].

[22:50:00] <cthulchu> zone.
[22:50:02] <ELFrederich> cloudbender, I would guess so.  Anonymous functions, or like Python lambdas\
[22:50:58] <sheetjs> n> function f() { return this; } const a = () => this, b = {f,a}; b.f() == b.a()
[22:50:59] <jellobot> (okay) false
[22:51:33] <physikoi> What does this mean? `import React, { useState } from 'react';`. Came across it on official site for react. If I only need `useState`, wouldn't i just do `import { useState } from 'react'`?

[22:52:26] <GreenJello> cthulchu, you want to display it in that format, but local time?
[22:52:38] <cthulchu> yes
[22:52:40] <sheetjs> stuff like <Foo ...> gets translated to a function call to React.createElement
[22:52:47] <wroathe> physikoi: The resulting calls to React.createElement require React to be in scope, but I believe there's now a babel configuration available that automatically does this for you

[22:53:56] <sheetjs> physikoi: so `React.createElement` has to be a thing.  In theory you can do something like `import { createElement } from 'react'; const React = { createElement };` but that's noisier

[23:50:52] <banana_> law*
[23:51:50] <banana_> besides doing a manual truth table
[23:51:57] <GreenJello> if A is false, then you always produce true, so B is only relevant if A is true, in which case the `A &&` doesn't do anything
[23:52:27] <Slade> Intl?  dayjs, luxon
[23:52:33] <GreenJello> I don't know the math for it
[23:52:39] <farn> you could use the distributive property. (A && B) || !A <=> (A || !A) && (B || !A) <=> true && (B || !A) <=> B || !A
[23:53:17] <farn> I guess I could have used = instead of <=>
[23:53:47] <farn> no wait, <=> is fine with propositions
[23:55:00] <paulcarroty> cool, I maybe did something like this in another life
[23:55:23] <GreenJello> Slade, we're in a bit of a transition stage, waiting on Temporal which should replace the date libraries
[23:55:36] <GreenJello> for now, use whatever
[23:55:38] <farn> FlorianBad: in what case do you want it to enter the if clause?
[23:55:50] <Slade> GreenJello, yea.. temporal probably isnt standardized enough eh

[23:56:21] <GreenJello> yeah, last I heard we're waiting on a production-ready polyfill
[23:56:29] <FlorianBad> farn: if the function returned something (typically an array, but I'd like to keep it short so it grabs the return variables (elements of the array) in the if
[23:57:45] <GreenJello> Slade, I use the Intl APIs for date formatting, but if you need to do date math or deal with timeless dates or durations or whatever, one of the date libraries will handle that fine
[23:57:54] <GreenJello> afaik they're all pretty much the same
[23:57:54] <farn> FlorianBad: then no, we don't have pattern matching
[23:58:02] <Slade> GreenJello, timezones mostly
[23:58:08] <FlorianBad> farn: I know what I'm writing is incorrect in syntax, but basically something like this:     `foobar(){ if( ... ){ return(5,6) } return undefined }  if( var(a,b) = foobar() ){ ... }else{ ... }`
[23:58:54] <FlorianBad> so that if foobar worked we get a=5 and b=6 and can do something in the first if, otherwise it goes to the else

[23:59:17] <GreenJello> Slade, Intl can format dates with specific timezones, but you need a library if you need to do timezone aware manipulation of dates
[23:59:41] <FlorianBad> Or should I return an object instead? How do people do this normally?
