[02:50:18] <technomancy> that would be the reasonable thing to do, unfortunately this is git we're talking about
[02:53:28] <sobel> i moved us from github to bitbucket in 2018. it's been pretty solid.
[02:54:16] <technomancy> I can't use bitbucket without getting the creeps ever since they redesigned it to look like jira =\
[02:54:34] <sobel> yeeeaaah i just try to stay away from the web if i can
[02:54:40] <ToxicFrog> sobel: no, ssh:// (or just user@host:path/to/repo.git) is ssh. git:// is its own custom thing that I didn't think anyone still used.
[02:56:47] <sobel> welp, when i started this place, our prod db had a cleartext port open to the world
[02:57:03] <sobel> rdp too

[08:29:12] <sandra> So far, maybe there's something else that I haven't seen yet, but the single most difficult thing about Clojure coming from Lisp has been annotations (or whaddeveryawannacallem. The ^ things. Sometimes metadata, sometimes type stuff, sometimes private variables) since they break the traditional paren wrap structure
[08:33:29] <technomancy> sandra: should always be metadata
[08:33:42] <technomancy> it's just that type stuff can be conveyed with metadata
[08:33:46] <sandra> Yeah
[08:34:03] <technomancy> but yeah, it's frustrating because you can have a single datum that looks like multiple things
[08:34:32] <technomancy> tagged literals like #inst "2021" have the same problem; not a fan of that notation
[08:35:17] <sandra> And #uuid. Absolutely.
[08:35:17] <sandra> It similarly breaks my ingrained reading of the code, like in what order I read things and such. Been doing Lisp for 22 years, and this ^ and # business is new.

[08:36:57] <sandra> In normal Lisp you can put in a ' or such but it only affects the immediately following sexp; this stuff OTOH affects… two following sexps? (define foo #uuid "7d7723ba-cae8-4021-92c6-bc6116300d74")
[08:36:57] <sandra> I'm like what sorcery is this?
[08:38:00] <sandra> I'm generally happy with cutting out obvious parens, like Clojure does in cond cases and let bindings, and I've gotten used to this thing too. It was just the most difficult thing so far.

[10:00:39] <sandra> In Chicken Scheme, reader macros can only slurp one more sexp afaiui
[10:03:49] <opqdonut> same in clojure, but the reader macro is the #uuid part
[10:04:38] <opqdonut> user-defined reader-macros are all of the form #tag, which makes things a bit more predictable compared to CL reader macros (IMO)
[10:10:29] <sandra> Yeah

[13:52:39] <joinr> same problem with no goog.provide (threeagent is expecting "three" while cljsjs only provides js/THREE, so you have to bridge it either way with js junk).

[14:13:52] <joinr> so pivoting toward cljs browser-based stuff has been nice, since the browser is trusted and via the cljs aot compilation for e.g. static web sites, provides a nice deployment target for various applications (primarily visuals currently).
[14:14:19] <EdwardIII> yeah. at least the jvm is quite packed with useful stuff :) be thankful you don't have to build your whole app in js ;)
[14:14:29] <joinr> uberjars + repl (even bundling e.g. nightcode as a portable IDE has been viable) also very helpful.
[14:15:46] <joinr> EdwardIII: if I could dev entirely outside and ship the compiled result (e.g. bundled js) that would be fine and enable using all the npm / shadowcljs stuff.  however, some of the deving has to be local due to proximity to data and working product, so being able to hack on it locally in realtime even in a limited environment has been crucial.
[14:16:05] <joinr> I am surprised by how much stuff is on NPM, it's crazy.

[14:16:44] <joinr> add in wasm and you get quite a battery.  tie it together with interop and paper over it with cljs;  so far has been quite pleasant once you get going...

[14:17:26] <EdwardIII> you're using wasm?
[14:18:07] <joinr> I have explored it for some stuff; namely bundling ffmpeg along for screen recording -> webm -> mp4 totally in the browser.
[14:18:17] <joinr> can't have ffmpeg native :(
[14:19:58] <joinr> there are some other libs from c/c++ (primarily mathematical programming solvers) that have been compiled to wasm and are reachable.  not ideal, but for some use cases they are handy to have access to (absent jvm alternatives).

[20:02:00] <EdwardIII> technomancy: what motivated you to make fennel? a particular use case or just for the hell of it?
[20:02:13] <EdwardIII> i saw fennel when looking into love2d too as i wanted to try love2d but had no desire to write lua heh
[20:02:55] <sandra> It makes me wanna get into löve2d 🧕
[20:04:10] <EdwardIII> i had this kinda crap idea but something that would amuse me, sort of jrpg-style but with typing challenges for battles
[20:04:25] <EdwardIII> like crappy 1bit jrpg + typing of the dead
[20:04:44] <EdwardIII> used a bit of pico-8 and dragonruby in the past
[20:07:23] <technomancy> EdwardIII: I wanted to make games for my kids; started out with minetest and then switched to love2d. lua worked fine for that for years but I always thought it could be a bit better as a lisp. (but I didn't make fennel; I did take over development from the creator who moved on)
[20:07:47] <technomancy> love2d is brilliant. there's also https://tic.computer which is similar to pico8 but nicer IMO and has fennel support built-in.
[20:08:19] <technomancy> every time I hear people talking about Unity they're complaining about how awful it is and I'm always like ... why do people subject themselves to that when there's such great alternatives? =D
[20:08:41] <EdwardIII> hehe. well from the odd thing i hear on IRC it's also trying to bend unity into doing something it's not intended for (like 2d games dev)
[20:09:14] <EdwardIII> me and my bro made a couple of real junk games in pico-8 and i did the music for them, we had great fun

[20:17:58] <sobel> i keep seeing love2d and jlwgl on my radar. i hope to have time to dump into game dev sometime. it's just fun.
[20:18:10] <technomancy> there's a lisp game jam every six months
[20:18:25] <sobel> and i need a structured excuse to make graphics and music, which i definitely don't do enough under professional demand
[20:19:14] <technomancy> I really like TIC for that because it forces you to go low-fi
[20:19:21] <sobel> <3
[20:19:37] <technomancy> I never felt like I could do my own art until I did my first TIC game
[20:20:08] <technomancy> (although the advantage of love2d is you can bring in existing art from CC-licensed sources)
[20:20:09] <sobel> i basically haven't done art on the computer since TheDraw was a thing
[20:20:17] <EdwardIII> the good thing about pico-8 (and maybe tic is the same) is that it gives you everything you need to make a game. gfx editor, music editor, sound effect editor, and extremely basic rendering tools
[20:20:29] <EdwardIII> so you don't get stuck in AP, you can just et on with it
[20:20:33] <sobel> i can operate a raytracer but it's so technical, i don't get into artistry with it
[20:21:44] <technomancy> EdwardIII: yeah, TIC has all that too, plus a font that doesn't make you eyes bleed =)

[20:22:33] *** Joins: arca0 (~tesuji@193.32.127.239)
[20:22:56] <EdwardIII> regarding fennel for games, do you actually use it like you use clojure? separating your stateful stuff from your stateful stuff? or not really? so it's just like lua with different syntax?
[20:23:10] <EdwardIII> stateful stuff from stateLESS stuff sorry
[20:23:22] <technomancy> EdwardIII: that's how I use it, yeah. but it doesn't force you to do that.
[20:23:46] <technomancy> like if you don't put all your state in one place then you're gonna be in a world of hurt trying to implement saving games
[20:23:50] <EdwardIII> technomancy: the former or the latter sorry?
[20:23:55] <EdwardIII> ah ha
[20:24:00] <EdwardIII> do you have something like an atom though?
[20:24:09] <technomancy> no, it requires more discipline
[20:24:22] <technomancy> there are libraries that implement immutable data structures but I haven't used them
[20:24:26] <EdwardIII> ah ha
[20:24:51] <EdwardIII> i have a suspcion the overhead in-game could become problematic
[20:25:03] <technomancy> totally depends on the game
[20:25:25] <technomancy> but yeah, while LuaJIT is much faster than the JVM at numerics, it's slower at GC
[20:25:27] <EdwardIII> definitely for my sick amazing high quality typing game that needs to run at 60fps constantly 
[20:26:29] <EdwardIII> technomancy: do you have an example gist anywhere at all of how you might extract state in a fennel game? 
[20:27:00] <technomancy> I literally have only seen one situation where luajit was too slow; it was when calculating orbital trajectories with like 15 different bodies in a system and extrapolating it out to 256 frames in the future with a super naive gravitation algorithm
