[00:44:53] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.
[00:45:06] <wallbroken> debian 11 has been released?

[05:12:18] <ciphrCat> what i find annoying is the mods suppress chatter about solving CAPTCHA
[05:13:39] <ciphrCat> CAPTCHA is anti-humanity masquerading as anti-robot, so ppl should be working to defeat CAPTCHA so we can move on.. to reach a point where humans don't face the damn things anymore

[06:40:33] <GenTooMan> has anyone noticed buster backports is strange now? things that were in it now suddenly aren't type of thing.
[06:40:52] <sney> can you be a little more specific?
[06:40:56] <jhutchins> PMT: I guess captchas tend to be a little more humane these days, some of the early ones were often un-guessable.
[06:41:31] <jhutchins> GenTooMan: You're sure you're not trying to get bullseye backports?
[06:42:56] <GenTooMan> I used apt-get install kicad/buster-backports to see if KiCAD 5.1.11 is available yet, instead if mumbled about 5.1.9 which was replaced in February or march with 5.1.10
[06:43:08] <sney> ,v kicad
[06:43:10] <judd> Package: kicad on amd64 -- stretch: 4.0.5+dfsg1-4; stretch-backports: 5.0.2+dfsg1-1~bpo9+1; buster: 5.0.2+dfsg1-1; stretch-backports-sloppy: 5.1.6+dfsg1-1~bpo9+1; buster-backports: 5.1.9+dfsg1-1~bpo10+1; bullseye: 5.1.9+dfsg1-1; bookworm: 5.99.0+really5.1.10+dfsg1-1; sid: 5.99.0+really5.1.10+dfsg1-1; experimental: 6.0.0~20210815.4852177+dfsg1-1
[06:44:01] <sney> GenTooMan: backports are not automatically updated with new upstream versions, it's more done when there's a specific demand in stable. the package maintainer has to do it manually
[06:44:32] <jhutchins> GenTooMan: Is there something specific you're looking for in the newer version?
[06:44:59] <sney> from judd's output here, it looks like new kicad updates have just started again with the bookworm cycle 
[06:45:24] <GenTooMan> sney yes but 5.1.10 WAS in backports and now it's not, that's confusing first second 5.1.9 has a sig fault error in it and it will just littally dump instantly.
[06:45:52] <GenTooMan> so it's very buggy, that's why it's confusing.
[06:45:53] *** Joins: CEP (~CEP@user/cep)
[06:46:21] <PMT> https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/kicad doesn't show any sign that 5.1.11 or 10 was ever in backports?
[06:46:40] *** Quits: Thoth (~thoth@2601:647:4903:69f0::81dc) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:46:44] <GenTooMan> I know I looked that's why I was somewhat confused.
[06:46:56] <PMT> Do you have any entry in dpkg.log or similar showing what you had installed?
[06:47:14] <PMT> Or, if you still have it installed, what version you're running now according to dpkg -s kicad or similar?
[06:48:42] <GenTooMan> I give up, I'll just build 5.1.11 no worries.
[06:50:26] <PMT> If it's crashing for you, it's probably worth at least reporting a bug about (assuming you haven't), ideally if you have any idea what change fixed it so they could consider cherrypicking it instead of just landing the whole newer version. I have no knowledge of how likely the maintainer is to cut a buster-backports{,-sloppy} for it, though.
[06:53:27] <GenTooMan> or I could be confused by my brain having a one off error (LOL) anything is possible.
[06:53:29] <somiaj> GenTooMan: also backports can only have version from release +1, so since bullseye has 5.1.9, buster-backports will never have a newer version than that.
[06:53:35] <somiaj> !sloppy backports
[06:54:24] <somiaj> !backports-sloppy
[06:54:25] <dpkg> stable-backports has packages from packages the current 'testing' release; you can upgrade from stable+backports to testing (or oldstable+backports to stable).  Packages that were backported from 'testing' to 'oldstable' are in oldstable-backports-sloppy; if you use these packages, then you can upgrade from oldstable+backports+backports-sloppy to stable+backports.  Sloppy means "relaxed rules" not "crap packages".
[07:00:13] <PMT> I suppose the only way cherrypicking it could happen at this point would be if it were a big enough deal to make it into actual bullseye and then could be backported.

[07:21:24] <puke> nope

[07:21:43] <PMT> somiaj: to be clear, I was asking if you meant "buster-backports-sloppy" and ordered it wrong, or were describing something separate.
[07:21:47] <somiaj> PMT: note, it could be that buster-backports-sloppy is empty right now, but it is a place that software from bookworm backported to buster could be put (sloppy backports are rarely used)
[07:22:04] <somiaj> oh yea, my bad....

[14:04:13] <bjorn`> ^ Adds route as a locally connected route, not via a gateway. But that's probably not what you want

[14:04:40] <sgon> jelly yeah, get rid of gw will work.But I don't quite understand it. Why it's allowed to route via 0.0.0.0, but not via 60.1 gateway?

[14:07:08] <bjorn`> But it can't

[14:07:47] *** Joins: malloy (~jimery@116.30.220.55)
[14:07:49] <bjorn`> That route is link-local / on-link, ie it says "IPs in this subnet are directly reachable without needing hops"
[14:08:18] <jelly> sgon, route for 192.168.60.0/24 over wlan0 says "this is a local network, you can send packets for ANY IP in it directly to the interface without worrying further"
[14:08:49] <jelly> sgon, so that one _enables_ the kernel to know how to reach 192.168.60.1
[14:09:16] <sgon> What happend If I change the default gateway? The reason why I am trying to change 192.168.60.0/24 route because I am about to change the default gateway to an internal VM. 
[14:09:46] <jelly> the default gateway is used to reach IP addresses that are NOT link-local for any interface
[14:10:21] <jelly> corollary: your default gateway MUST be an IP address on one of link-local networks.
[14:10:21] <bjorn`> please do and paste `ip route`

I successfully did this once before and I remembered I just changed the default gateway. It's a long time ago. I don't quite understand it right now.
[14:16:04] <jelly> sgon, what does "internal VM" mean?  how is this machine going to reach 192.168.56.2?
[14:16:37] <bjorn`> Right, so what you need to do, on all hosts; is to remove the default route, and add a new default route via .2 `ip route del default; ip route add default via 192.68.56.2`
[14:16:40] *** Parts: cadmio (~cadmio@151.19.229.221) (WeeChat 3.0)

[14:17:07] <jelly> sgon, show the complete "ip r" output, then
[14:17:24] <bjorn`> Ofcourse the easiest way would probably be to just switch the IP addresses of the old and new routers (1 gets 2, 2 gets 1)
[14:17:28] <jelly> sgon, and "ip a" while we're at it
[14:18:20] <jelly> if you want to change default route, you change default route, not route to some local network segment
[14:18:45] <jelly> default route is the one where destination is 0.0.0.0/0

[14:19:31] <sgon> I did this before on both debian and MacOS. It should work. From my memory, I just changed the default gateway. But right now, the routing table looks different than before from my memory.

[15:37:35] <IIll> hi. installing on wifi but wifi driver missing. debian 11, firmware file iwlwifi-7260-17.ucode. ran into it, downloaded the 3GB firmware-11.0.0 iso hoping it would contain the firmware, same issue
[15:40:59] <BCMM> IIll: hmm. iwlwifi-7260-17.ucode has been part of the firmware-iwlwifi package for a long time
[15:41:44] <BCMM> what are the exact indications that the wifi isn't working? does the non-free installer specifically ask for that ucode file?
[15:44:42] <IIll> the installer asks for it, yes. i can see a firmware-iwlwifi.. deb file in /cdrom/firmware
[15:45:06] <IIll> i now hoped to extract it and copy its content to /lib/firmware but ar x gives me "short read"
[15:46:30] <IIll> i am booted into https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/amd64/iso-dvd/firmware-11.0.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso
[15:46:39] <BCMM> IIll: shot in the dark here, but did you create the install medium using Rufus?
[15:46:41] *** Joins: cadmio (~cadmio@151.25.133.243)
[15:46:59] <IIll> yep indeed. 
[15:47:13] <IIll> i used iso mode in rufus should i do dd mode instead?
[15:47:17] <IIll> did it somehow mess up the image?
[15:47:21] <BCMM> don't use Rufus. it breaks filesystems because the developer is stubborn.
[15:47:22] <cadmio> I've no sound on my debian
[15:47:31] <BCMM> IIll: yeah, dd mode should be fine
[15:47:51] <IIll> hum debian also says dont use unetbootin so my windows options that i know of came down to rufus :-D  i will try with dd mode
[15:47:56] <IIll> thanks.
[15:48:38] <BCMM> IIll: "ISO mode" tries to automatically modify DVD images to make them suitable for USB boot. this is unnecessary because just about every distro has been shipping "hybrid" images, that work fine from USB, for years.
[15:48:47] <BCMM> and also, it tends to break things
[15:49:34] <BCMM> dd mode just writes the Debian image to USB without modifying it (like dd would)
[15:49:49] <cadmio> on alsamixer the Master is at 100
[15:50:06] <BCMM> the rufus developer has some sort of objection to hybrid images, so keeps ISO mode as the recommended setting *even when rufus detects a hybrid image*
[15:52:51] <IIll> the installer loads up fine just doesnt find some drivers then. weird behaviour
[15:53:00] <BCMM> so rufus does work, but only if you set dd mode, ignoring the warnings in the application. i tend to think that people should just avoid Rufus entirely and discourage others from using it too. for windows, there's win32diskimager (but it has the issue of having to change to "all files" in the Open dialog, because it only looks for *.img by default) or Etcher (but it has the issue of being a massive download because it's built on Electron).
[15:53:38] <BCMM> IIll: yeah, that's pretty normal for Rufus damage. the problems usually involve images booting, but then not being able to access certain files.
[15:53:57] <IIll> debian.org recommends iso mode with rufus by the way
[15:54:07] <IIll> https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall#Creating_a_Bootable_Debian_USB_Flashdrive
[15:54:13] <BCMM> in the wiki?
[15:54:14] <BCMM> oh yeah
[15:54:17] <IIll> As of Debian 10.10, ISO mode (recommended by Rufus) should work fine for machines booting with UEFI. Older machines may need to use dd mode.
[15:54:24] <IIll> well maybe my machine is one of this older machines :-D
[15:54:44] <BCMM> to be honest, i don't think i agree with that
[15:54:44] <IIll> thinkpad x240 not exactly the newest hardware
[15:55:41] <BCMM> there's just not any upside to using iso mode, as far as i can see
[15:56:04] <cadmio> this is the situation right now https://imgur.com/4nHBvcf.png
[15:57:16] <IIll> cadmio, try selecting the master entry and press m to unmute
[15:58:13] <BCMM> cadmio: yeah, master is turned to 100 but also muted (that's what MM means)
[15:58:29] <BCMM> you might want to turn it down a bit before unmuting
[15:59:10] <cadmio> now it's set to 00 but I have no sound yet
[16:00:23] <BCMM> IIll: the wiki page has been edited relatively recently, by the way https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstall?action=diff&rev2=131&rev1=130
[16:00:46] <BCMM> there are, unfortunately, people who agree with the developers of rufus, despite all the problems
[16:02:05] <jelly> debian cd images are complex enough on its own, and some degree of cooperation between image creators and image manglers is required;  I think you're seeing the results of some of that cooperation with 
[16:02:26] <BCMM> the comment (on that edit) of "No, Rufus doesn't modify ISO files" misses the point *entirely*. nobody claimed that it will actually change the .iso file in your downloads folder, but it is objectively true that data written to the USB stick will not exactly match that iso image
[16:02:27] <jelly> that "rufus doesn't completely break images for 10.10 any more"
[16:02:56] <jaguart> does anyone know if the needrestart package is needed after upgrading to bullseye? Asking because the upgrade asks about restarting services without notice... or is that an update in the needrestart package... hmmm
[16:03:12] <jelly> the safest thing to do is still "copy the .iso bitwise exactly to whole usb stick"

[16:57:27] <PMT> Razva: do you want to know "if my host directly has a public IP address assigned, what is it", or do you want to know "if this host can reach the internet, what IP does it connect from?"
[16:57:50] <Razva> that's what I'm thinking right now...
[16:57:52] <Razva> hmmm
[16:58:00] <Razva> because maybe the server will not have a public IP

[23:25:12] <xx> since 2016
[23:25:37] <mrfb_> that's a debian classic
[23:25:46] <n4dir> porn?
[23:25:55] <mrfb_> orphaned packages
[23:26:31] *** Quits: cosimone (~user@93-44-184-163.ip98.fastwebnet.it) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:26:35] <n4dir> xx: i'd propose to ask what you asked again when more are around who are deeper into how debian does what. 
[23:27:00] <n4dir> that really is strange. 
[23:27:07] <mrfb_> or go to official irc channel
[23:27:09] <xx> I would have thought pornography would be bring a lot of people's attention
[23:27:43] <n4dir> most probably search for the homepage by other means, not via the debian-site
[23:27:44] <mrfb_> funny thing is, no one before noticed this?
[23:27:50] <n4dir> or that is just me. 
[23:28:42] <n4dir> perhaps #debian-mentors (?) might know what to do
[23:29:27] *** Joins: mentor (~mentor@user/mentor)
[23:29:27] <n4dir> someone here will know too. Just not right now, it seems
[23:31:52] <mrfb_> humm
[23:32:34] <mrfb_> I wonder how many distros have the same problem
[23:32:47] *** Joins: wigums_ (~wigums@user/wigums)
[23:33:40] <amacater> I'd suggest a quick note on debian-www since they'll be able to deactivate the link ...
[23:34:04] <amacater> but yes, it's a case of someone buying the domain and pushing porn from it
[23:34:15] <mrfb_> or the developers selling it
[23:34:32] <mrfb_> because it probably had some traffic back then
[23:35:54] <xx> it probably hasn't been spotted for years
[23:36:48] <mrfb_> yep, that was a good catch
[23:40:16] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:40:38] *** Quits: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:42:19] <xx> talking of good catches, why does the package 'calendar' depend on 'cpp'?
[23:43:08] <xx> it most definitely should not
[23:46:33] <ansgar> xx: So you can #define macros for events, #include other people's calendars and have conditional events with #if? :)
[23:46:39] *** Quits: timahvo1 (~rogue@105.163.2.154) (Quit: leaving)
[23:48:17] <xx> lol
[23:48:43] <xx> so if a package has wrong dependancies, will it remain that way for the entire lifetime of bullseye?
[23:48:53] <xx> (wrong = extra, such as in this case)
[23:49:00] <johnjay> what do i do to fix apt-get saying package are broken?
[23:49:15] <xx> johnjay: paste the entire error message to some paste service
[23:49:24] <joepublic> dpkg: bat
[23:49:24] <dpkg> [Basic Apt* Troubleshooting]. To diagnose your problem, we need ALL OF THE FOLLOWING information: 1. complete output of your apt-get/apt/aptitude run (including the command used) 2. output from "apt-cache policy pkg1 pkg2..." for ALL packages mentioned ANYWHERE in the problem, and 3. "apt-cache policy".  Use https://paste.debian.net/ to provide us with this information.  Also ask me about <localized errors>.
[23:49:28] <natechan> PMT: thanks again for your help.  i was able to get it going by following your advice and stealing the initrd and vmlinuz from the installed disk, mostly by following the relevant steps from http://phwl.org/2021/qemu-armhf-debian/#12-for-32-bit-armhf with the appropriate substitutions
[23:49:29] <johnjay> I can't. it says it has to do with pkgProblemResolver
[23:49:45] <johnjay> I'm trying apt-get to remove something called gsettings
[23:49:50] *** Quits: DsszzD (~DsszzD@2409:4060:11c:bb50::4c9:e0a5) (Remote host closed the connection)

[23:50:40] <johnjay> oh this is a bullseye install. maybe it needs distupgrade?
[23:51:53] <mrfb_> johnjay: installed bat and another rust app?
[23:52:19] <mrfb_> oh nevermind, crossed conversations sorry
[23:52:39] *** Quits: spare (~64a5zrjd5@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:56:05] <johnjay> i think i somehow accidentally triggered a mass upgrade
[23:56:21] <johnjay> it's replacing a ton of packages. i caught it said emacs 27 over emacs 26. 27 is the default in bullseye correct?
[23:57:34] *** Joins: rendar (~rendar@user/rendar)
[23:57:36] <rendar> i have just upgraded to Debian 11, i have rebooted then the network interface (enp3s0) was DOWN, and i add to restore it up, and calling manually /sbin/dhcpclient enp3s0 -- plus, every window i try to open in xfce takes ~50 seconds to materialize, even the login and desktop creation takes ~2 minutes, what's going on?
[23:57:38] <joepublic> so, apt remove so-and-so is replacing a ton of packages?
[23:57:50] <johnjay> somehow me doing apt-get remove that one broken package is like updating everything
[23:57:54] <johnjay> joepublic: yes
[23:58:44] <johnjay> all the messages are like "Unpacking package xyz 25 over xyz 24"
