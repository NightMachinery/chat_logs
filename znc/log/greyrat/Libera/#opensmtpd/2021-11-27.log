[07:21:11] <scara> https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.conf#senders What is <users>? I set it to <passwd> but got this error "smtp failed-command command="MAIL FROM:<[snip]>" result="421 4.3.0 Temporary Error""
[07:22:29] <jrmu> users tells you who can send to where
[07:22:35] <jrmu> it's supposed to do basic authentication of senders
[07:23:12] <scara> I know that, I want to make it so you can't spoof the MAIL FROM but I can't figure out the format it wants from me.
[07:23:43] <scara> I added exactly this "senders <passwd> masquerade"
[07:23:47] <jrmu> sender@ircnow.org: username@ircnow.org
[07:23:51] <jrmu> I think sender can send as username
[07:24:04] <scara> Where do you see that?
[07:24:41] <jrmu> I think in $ man smtpd.conf
[07:24:44] <jrmu> senders <users> [masquerade]
[07:25:09] <jrmu> Look up the authenticated user in the users mapping table to find the email addresses that user is allowed to submit mail as.  In addition, if the masquerade option is provided, the From header is rewritten to match the sender provided in the SMTP session.
[07:25:49] <scara> Yea I got that but where do you see the format?
[07:26:04] <scara> "users mapping table"
[07:26:44] <jrmu> hmm
[07:26:56] <jrmu> my guess is $ man table
[07:27:04] <jrmu> all the tables in smtpd i think follow the same format
[07:27:17] <scara> Didn't even think of that
[07:31:49] <scara> Nice it works
[07:32:56] <scara> Looks like, "email authname"
[07:56:12] <jrmu> cool scara 
[07:56:16] <jrmu> yeah something like that
