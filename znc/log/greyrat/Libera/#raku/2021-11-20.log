[01:01:31] <patrickb> Is this a rakudobug?
[01:05:11] <japhb> patrickb: Are you wanting to say "a Positional that contains a bunch of Lists"?
[01:05:29] <japhb> (Er, because that's what you are currently saying)
[01:05:54] <patrickb> Actually I think the signature is bogus and should be corrected. But the error is about an optional param I'm not passing...
[01:06:07] <patrickb> wait
[01:06:09] <patrickb> positional?
[01:06:35] <japhb> The '@' sigil indicates that a type `does Positional`
[01:06:38] <[Coke]> first has a : so not a positional, I think.
[01:06:57] <patrickb> ah you are refering to the variable, not the signature
[01:07:11] <japhb> [Coke]: It's a named argument whose value is a Positional containing Lists
[01:07:21] <patrickb> agreed
[01:08:00] <patrickb> That is bogus, I agree, but the error it throws is wrong, right?
[01:08:18] <japhb> I'm guessing the problem is that the default value for an optional Positional is an empty Array
[01:08:39] <patrickb> It should complain that $a is not a string, but instead complains about an optional I didn't pass.
[01:08:40] <japhb> Are you asking if the default should change to be Array[List]?
[01:09:06] <japhb> First argument caused a binding failure, so had already errored.
[01:09:09] <patrickb> If I turn the `1` into a `"1"` the error goes away.
[01:09:27] <japhb> m: sub s(Str :$a, List :@l) { }; s(:a(1));

[01:09:47] <patrickb> m: sub s(List :@l, Str :$a) { }; s(:a("1"));
[01:09:47] <camelia> rakudo-moar 254a9cb33: ( no output )
[01:10:32] <japhb> I think the fact that it complains about the @l binding when the *other* argument doesn't match, but not when it does, is goofy.
[01:10:40] <japhb> So yeah, there's a bug there I think.
[01:10:42] <patrickb> I'm not convinced that it should be possible to get type missmatch errors for optionals I didn't pass.
[01:11:45] <japhb> patrickb: Since you didn't supply a default for @l, either Raku should intuit the type for the "default default", or it should error.  I think you're arguing for the former.
[01:12:14] <japhb> Er ... am I understanding you correctly?
[01:12:48] <patrickb> I think you understand correctly.
[01:13:17] <patrickb> m: my List @l; dd @l;
[01:13:18] <camelia> rakudo-moar 254a9cb33: OUTPUT: ¬´Array[List] @l = Array[List].new()‚ê§¬ª
[01:13:50] <patrickb> default working fine, or is this something different?

[01:14:38] <japhb> Yeah, I think that's a bug

[19:26:35] <patrickb> We currently don't offer precompiled releases for openbsd, because there are some technical difficulties. 
[19:27:06] <patrickb> rakubrew can compile from source, but can also download precompiled releases. 
[19:27:22] <MasterDuke> i would expect compiling with rakubrew to work, but if not couldn't you take the script or whatever from ports and manually use that?
[19:27:24] <patrickb> Use the `download` and `build` subcommands respectively.

[23:00:36] <Kaiepi> SmokeMachine, the &factory block looks gather-ish. do the assignments come with side effects? 
[23:03:15] <SmokeMachine> Kaiepi: I use the model type to generate factory type for each model used by a factory and each factory is a instance of that class. The assignments applies to that instance
[23:10:08] <SmokeMachine> Kaiepi: does that make sense?
[23:10:23] <Kaiepi> replacing the assignments with take (key => value) in combination with something like .bless(|(gather block), |%rest) might allow for bindings to work as well
[23:13:36] <SmokeMachine> That was my first try, but I wanted that to need the method to exist‚Ä¶ to maybe in a future have that autocompleted by an ide‚Ä¶
[23:13:47] <Kaiepi> ah
[23:14:01] <SmokeMachine> Make sense?
[23:16:12] <Kaiepi> not really :(. not very familiar with red
