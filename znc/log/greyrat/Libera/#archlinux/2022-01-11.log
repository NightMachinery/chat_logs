[02:03:30] <yamii> So I came up with the following PKGBUILD: https://bpa.st/XYIA. It builds and I can install it, but executing larynx fails because some dep is not available (gruut). Upon closer inspection of the requirements.txt in the GitHub repo I saw that there more deps that I am missing. Some of them are available either in official repos or the AUR, but not all. Do I have to package the missing ones as

My laptop then thinks it only has 1 screen, which messes up the locations of all my windows. Does anyone know how to make it so that Linux turns the screen off, but not the entire monitor device?

[09:28:46] <SigmaWP> My problem is that when the external monitor goes to sleep, my laptop doesn't detect it anymore. So e.g. I wake up my laptop, and the laptop screen turns on first (so it thinks it has one screen, and moves everything from the external monitor to the primary screen), and then the external monitor wakes up a few seconds later (now it thinks it has two screens, but it can't move the windows back to the second screen)

[16:01:02] <backes> okay, what is different between the two?
[16:01:08] <mpan> backes: you download a files database, a week passes, new packages are on the mirror and they contain slightly different set of files. If you don’t update… they are out of sync.
[16:01:54] <mpan> backes: in what way “different”? Technically there is little, except one is managed by -S, the other with -F. They are even updated by the same code, just invoked by different things.

[16:07:24] <mpan> krux03: but your question may suggest a misconception: the whole process is not centered around “installing packages from AUR”. Nothing in the chain cares where you got the PKGBUILD from and how packages are later managed and used is also unrelated to AUR. Which is why usually you still want them compressed to not waste space.
[16:07:29] <mpan> backes: -Q
[16:07:45] <teraflops> backes: there is your local database, how would you know if it is not up to date? that's where the -F database comes in place, a different one to compare to

[16:08:59] <backes> my question was there because -F showed a file with a location which didn't exist on my system. I thought that pacman keeps this up to date when I install/remove packages. So I'm surprised that I have to manually update a files database
[16:09:08] <mpan> backes: a sync database contains information about packages available. You download the actual package file from a mirror, which contains the files (and therefore the list of them). Which is then stored in the local (-Q) database.
[16:09:29] <mpan> backes: a completely separate, unrelated feature is being able to find files in not installed packages: that is what -F does.

[16:10:27] *** Joins: gr33n7007h (~gr33n7007@user/gr33n7007h)
[16:10:36] <mpan> And it’s neither kept nor updated along with the sync (-S) database, as that is a quite substantial list that would need to be updated literally each time every single package in the repository is updated.
[16:10:47] <another|> sync db != file db != local db
[16:10:51] <krux03> mpan, I know about the process. I think Arch packages are one of the most transparent in this regard. But when I install packages from AUR my process is to install packages from AUR, I don not care that there is some intermediate .tar.gz format for the package, but I do care that the package is installed as a package and can be removed as a package
[16:11:12] <mpan> krux03: so, as I said, in makepkg.conf you may just set the suffix to .tar and it will not compress.
[16:11:28] <krux03> mpan, yes I figuerd that out.
[16:11:29] <mpan> It will still tar it, as pacman requires a package file to install it.
[16:11:31] <backes> mpan: thanks, that explains it

[18:33:11] <luigibu> Namarrgon: my lang problems are fixed. whas that kde file. Thanks for your help!
[18:34:32] <gn0me> thank jonathan; ill take a look. Geeze what a setup for a simple thing as vpn... pff
[18:34:41] <tylee> Hello. I want to programmatically disable internet access for my user only in a time range to not to distract from studying lol. But still keep it working for nginx, for example. How to do it?

[18:36:16] <jelle> tylee: localhost works fine if you unplug the cable
[18:36:31] <earnestly> tylee: Put your user session into a new network namespace
[18:37:02] <earnestly> If it's just intranet that needs to function, you can probably do that via router

[18:45:23] <baltazar> hi! is it possible to tell networkmanager to prefer ethernet over wifi? seemingly when I'm connected to both a wireless and a wired network, all traffic goes through the wireless
[18:46:45] <Foxboron> Yes. Look at the priority in the connection settings
[18:46:51] <BrainDamage> route priority is what determines where default traffic goes
[18:46:56] *** Joins: rickybob (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob)
[18:48:03] <uuidNuniq> you mean rule priority 
[18:48:22] <uuidNuniq> ip rule 
[18:48:52] <BrainDamage> no, route, ip route
[18:49:00] <uuidNuniq> rule policy priority determines 
[18:49:02] <baltazar> I see an option called "Connect automatically with priority", but I assumed it affected which one it will connect to, not the routes. is that the one?
[18:49:30] <BrainDamage> the metric is what determines where packets get sent to, for equal specificity of address range
[18:49:39] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@98.97.127.52)
[18:50:22] <BrainDamage> baltazar: iirc that also impacts route metric
[18:50:29] <uuidNuniq> BrainDamage: but rule rules first. if you have a rule like : 1:      from all fwmark 0x1 lookup 100 . then the marked package will go to table 100 
[18:50:32] <uuidNuniq> not table main

[18:57:57] <BrainDamage> that's the opposite of what you want
[18:58:21] <BrainDamage> route metric is like a distance equivalent, higher metric means lower preference
