[19:26:51] <ormaaj> remember when firefox had integrated rss... that was convenient. It could fetch feeds and do the html rendering too. IIRC it even briefly coexisted with early versions of their sync function, but eventually integrated rss went away. Probably around the time they killed XUL.

[19:35:23] <ormaaj> 1 continuously persistent tcp connection per user is not exactly a boost in efficiency over polling.
[19:39:22] <Earnestly> ormaaj: I quite like pull for this because interruptions can be scheduled, especially when none of these articles would ever be available with low latency.  push would only be useful for cases where I need immediate knowledge of something happening

[19:44:05] <ormaaj> A thing I don't know much about is the STUN thing for the peer connection feature used for VOIP like protocols. I guess you could have a scheme where there is one persistent connection to a server that does nothing but aggregate "events" to dispatch through the persistent connection to trigger the client side to establish new connections. So you can have semi-polled protocols but with push-like instant notification

[20:11:03] <The_Blode_> Works great.

[20:14:09] <The_Blode_> Anything else will be dealt with by the else condition
[20:14:09] <ormaaj> read will only stop reading if either the FD triggers EOF or the delimiter is read
[20:14:33] <ormaaj> I don't know what you mean by syntax error.
[20:14:41] <The_Blode_> Let me grab it. One moment.
[20:14:50] <ormaaj> not really relevant to I/O with read
[20:15:14] <The_Blode_> When I'm asked by my script "Would you like to see debug?" I issue "read n"
[20:15:30] <The_Blode_> If I enter no input and hit the Enter key, I get "bash: Y: unknown operand"
[20:15:56] <ormaaj> always use `read -r`. never without -r
[20:16:00] <The_Blode_> It's not script breaking but it's scruffy.

[21:10:52] <tirnanog> well, they probably would prefer neither in this case.
[21:11:10] <ormaaj> I've seen a few rather large projects by large companies / organizations using gpl v3. I suspect there it's a form of sabotage to make the project commercially uninteresting.

[21:16:08] <ormaaj> that case I find particularly bizarre because one of the key perks historically to ngspice is ability to build it as a library and load your own models as libraries (with xspice). I guess they perhaps don't mind GPL if they primarily use it in sort of HPC systems where all the IPC is MPI over a network.
