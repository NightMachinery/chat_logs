[03:11:17] <artao> Like 5 min or so. Middle of the night, full moon lighting -- tho you don't see the moon ever. Camera opens with a man, naked and surround by dense tall corn
[03:12:01] <artao> he wakes up groggily and looks around in confusion. stands up and starts wandering about, muttering. trying to follow a plow trail. but the plow trail keeps changing. the corn keeps pressing in on him
[03:12:23] <artao> finally the corns' roots entangle his feet and he falls down, trying to claw away

[03:33:12] <artao> not in the u.s. they don't

[04:08:47] <zenema> TomatoSynth: Ahaha, I'm all over the place this evening! Yup, the original is just "whoooa!" :)
[04:09:30] <TomatoSynth> ok, glad u know. with people on irc i can never tell if people are just randomly posted from a playlist..OR..in my case, are posting something that is deeply personal love 4 me
[04:10:30] <zenema> I'm not 100% sure this autechre mix is legit.. but I like it! Oh, I don't keep playlists, that's too easy!
[04:11:07] <zenema> I like trying to remember "What the hell was that I bumped into a couple of years back.." :D
[04:12:14] <zenema> I think I probably ended up bumping into this via a Current 93 binge!

[04:13:55] <zenema> Pleased to meet you!
[04:14:14] <TomatoSynth> c93 stuff is soo ridiculously pricey nowadays. all those english bands are the same. its all a bit much, but sometimes i bite the bullet. a few years ago i traveled to london just to see them, i'm still paying those bills and it was totally worth it! hahaa
[04:14:49] <zenema> Oooh, I've never seen them live! I would like that very much!
[04:15:00] <zenema> There's nothing else much like Mr. Tibet!
[04:15:19] <TomatoSynth> it was wonderful. and players from coil c93 and nurse with wound were there
[04:15:36] <zenema> Yoiks! Now that sounds like a treat!
[04:15:59] <TomatoSynth> nurse was great as well, yes it really really was. tibet was in form for sure.
[04:16:14] <zenema> This whole covid thing has been a nightmare, I hope to get out to see some decent acts over the summer.
[04:16:26] <zenema> No doubt!
[04:16:50] <zenema> I wasn't sure what to make of his most recent creation...
[04:16:52] <TomatoSynth> current 93 is coming to usa again i thought about going. i also haven't seen anything since then

[05:03:54] <artao> ........ Monday night?
[05:04:08] <artao> efex what do you mean by that?
[05:04:08] <macrobat> you could play wordle
[05:04:22] <artao> use a camera to "scan" physical photos?
[05:04:24] <artao> fuck no!!
[05:04:29] <efex> yes
[05:04:47] <efex> it works fine, I have even got workabe shots of negatives
[05:04:48] <artao> full on scanner. optical 4K. 16-bit integer to 32-bit float
[05:05:00] <artao> essential for GOOD scans
[05:05:08] <efex> I have a Nikon Coolscan 4000
[05:05:12] <artao> correctable. usable.
[05:05:17] <artao> cool
[05:05:18] <artao> heh heh
[05:05:31] <artao> i have zero scanners ... that  can use .... 
[05:05:33] <artao> WAIT
[05:05:39] * artao suddenly realizes
[05:05:56] <artao> maybe i can use that scanner with one (or both) of my old-ass laptops!!
[05:06:00] <efex> truly try any dslr in good light
[05:06:06] <artao> the most modern of which is a Pentium 3
[05:06:18] <efex> hey if that workas great
[05:06:50] <efex> I have a flatbed scanner I got for 10 buck at a charity shop.. no windows drivers
[05:06:57] <artao> efex if the camera can do 16-bpp integer to 32-bit float, okay ........ except for the lens distortion
[05:07:05] <efex> fine on mac tho!
[05:07:22] <artao> a scanner has zero lens distortion ......... nor any other camera artifacts either analog or digital for that matter
[05:07:54] <artao> it's straight up linear pixel by pixel ... tho i guess it's IDEAL if you also use a color profile of said scanner
[05:08:10] <artao> however!! scanners have much different color profiles than cameras
[05:08:42] <artao> cameras are designed for human visual perception. scanners are designed for physically accurate 
[05:08:53] <efex> artao: your call. I mention my nikon 4000 dpi scanner (with infrared dust removal) to indicate I have and use high end scanners… from that point f view I still suggest just shooting old oix with a camera, scan when you have a chance

[05:14:15] <Janet> ^ Error retrieving title. Check the log for more details.
[05:14:27] <artao> i can imagine how it might work. dust will absorb the light of the scanner and retransmit light at different wavelengths than the photo (or film negative) itself
[05:14:29] <artao> i can see that
[05:14:34] <artao> interesting
[05:14:54] <artao> SUPER sensitive equipment for that tho. the sensor would have to be cryo-cooled for that
[05:15:21] <artao> well ... perhaps thermo-electrically cooled would work.
[05:15:32] <artao> regardless, dust removal is better done by hand
[05:15:36] <efex> and thanks re accepting my experience in fact!
[05:15:50] <artao> auto-dust removal always leaves odd anomalies somewhere
[05:16:14] <artao> of course, a fastidious photo-editor would go thru post auto to find and correct thoe
[05:16:29] <artao> okay yeah. auto-dust removal totally has it's place. by default, try it
[05:16:35] <artao> it may be all that's needed
[05:17:11] <artao> efex my photo-scanning, retouching, and restoration experience is ... FUCK!! really? wow

[05:17:16] <artao> FUCK

[05:18:36] <artao> 7-color Epson printers with archival ink that could print on anything from regular roll paper to full on hand-made cotton (up to a certain paper weight, of course) to canvas ...
[05:19:05] <efex> ICE is amazing
[05:19:22] <artao> AND!! Burne Photo Imaging had early REAL laser printers. I.E. - Use RGB lasers to DIRECTLY expose and develop photographic paper
[05:19:22] <efex> not perfect
[05:19:35] <efex> it reduces detail just a tad
[05:19:36] <artao> no conversion from computer RGB to ink CMYK
[05:20:00] <SteppenwolfVM> i guess this professional bit was before you damaged your brain artao
[05:20:00] <artao> DIRECT RGB printing .... You literally end up with a photograph, including all its archival properties.
[05:21:24] <artao> and, of course, you can send whatever-the-fuck photo paper thru it. Cuz it's "just light" ... Full visual spectrum RGB tho. 32-bit float. WELL outside of sRGB or even Adobe sRGB or other. FULL 32-bit RGB palette
[05:22:01] <artao> i know this is a music channel, so I'm betting most here don't understand print vs. photo and color theory re: additive vs subtractive color

[05:46:24] <artao> Interestingly, early computer music was ENTIRELY academic
[05:46:29] <artao> Thoughts on that?
[05:46:34] <artao> Why? o.O
[05:47:14] <artao> Classical musicians took computer music more seriously than "recording music"
[05:47:17] <artao> cuz why?
[05:47:25] <morlog> colleges and the government were the only people that could afford computers
[05:47:41] <morlog> they used to fill warehouses
[05:47:46] <artao> granted ....... to get access to that equipment you had to have access to that academic environment
[05:47:55] <artao> Eliane Radigue for instance
[05:48:30] <TomatoSynth> eliane rules
[05:48:31] <morlog> my grandfather ran the air force payroll computers here in Austin back in the 50's

[05:50:27] <artao> "The song was a last-minute addition that was inserted before its premiere in 1928 because Harald Paulsen, the actor who played Macheath, demanded that Brecht and Weill add another number that would more effectively introduce his character"
[05:50:31] <artao> -- wikipedia
[05:51:08] <artao> OOOH! and it's originally in German? NICE ... I can do that. I have a pretty damn good German accent

[06:00:02] <artao> FINE
[06:00:27] <artao> I just recorded myself acapella singing the whole song, to the Louis Armstrong version (hearing it only in my head)
[06:00:39] <artao> also, i play a damn good trumpet rendition of it
[06:01:41] <artao> tho it's SUPER hard cuz of how high register it is. High C above register is common. High Bb above register required. Ability to lip-slide above-register notes down an octave preferred
[06:01:55] <artao> VERY VERY difficult. i used to be able to do it almost flawlessly
[06:02:06] <macrobat> transposition
[06:02:26] <LibertyDillo> morlog> made a pot of coffee in it just now << /me needs to do some hunting at 2nd hand stores

[06:02:38] <artao> morlog fuck transpostion. that shit pisses me off LOL
[06:02:56] <artao> re: Bb trumpet to C ....... and other such
[06:03:19] <artao> MY trumpet has a removable slide section that switches it between Bb and C
[06:03:23] <LibertyDillo> hey, you'd be amazed how much stuff a good bicycle can hold
[06:03:40] <macrobat> this type makes good coffee. when it works https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_coffee_maker
[06:03:41] <artao> the ONLY time I put the tuning slide in is when playing from trumpet sheet music
[06:03:41] <Janet> ^ A vacuum coffee maker brews coffee using two chambers where vapor pressure and gravity produce coffee. This type of coffee maker is also known as vac pot, siphon or syphon coffee maker, and was invented by Loeff of Berlin in the 1830s.

[07:07:52] <artao> i see ... i'm sry you take it that way. NOT how intended

[19:38:09] <morlog> today is see how fast a 100 watt solar panel will charge my powerbank
[19:38:41] <murthy> Nice
[19:39:26] <murthy> Seperate solar charge controller or power bank inbuilt one?
[19:39:31] <morlog> it puts out 20v on an open load, probably drops to 18v on a load
[19:39:47] <morlog> powerbank has one built in with mqtt
[19:39:52] <murthy> Mine is 18V
[19:40:02] <murthy> 150 watts one
[19:40:12] <morlog> most are if they are big
[19:40:38] <murthy> morf: tell me the model number of your power bank
[19:40:44] <morlog> 20v when they arent powering anything, drops down to 18v when they are
[19:41:14] <murthy> Ya no load voltage
[19:44:35] <morlog> want to build a solar panel setup for my recumbent
[19:44:38] <murthy> I am sure if you are talking about a power bank that people use to charge mobiles or the ones people use to power home appliances
[19:44:53] <murthy> I mean I am not sure
[19:45:15] <murthy> I think the laster ones are called power stationd
[19:45:18] <murthy> Sations
[19:45:22] <murthy> Fsck
[19:45:27] <morlog> it has a 220 watt inverter, 2 12v ports, and 3 usb ports
[19:45:27] <murthy> Stations
[19:45:48] <murthy> Ah power station
[19:45:57] <murthy> That's not a power bank
[19:46:01] <morlog> 1 of the usb ports is a 60w bidirectional usb c port
[19:46:06] <murthy> Which brand?
[19:46:11] <morlog> it is a powerbank
[19:46:19] <morlog> also called a solar generator
[19:46:29] <murthy> Ok
[19:46:37] <morlog> can charge from multiple sources
[19:46:47] <murthy> Can anyone choose a flute for me?
[19:47:03] <murthy> morlog: nice
[19:47:22] <morlog> ive been looking at piccolo flutes myself
[19:47:30] <murthy> If no is going to help me choose, I am going to choose randomly
[19:47:46] <murthy> morlog: nice!
[19:47:59] <morlog> what kind of flute are you looking to get
[19:48:05] <murthy> morlog: I am looking for an Indian Bansuri
[19:48:25] <morlog> dont think i can help you with that one
[19:48:25] <murthy> There are different types and different scales
[19:48:31] <morlog> but ill look
[19:49:21] <murthy> I will tell you the options available
[19:49:27] <morlog> ph, a bamboo flute
[19:49:31] <morlog> oh
[19:49:44] <morlog> ive made those before
[19:50:18] <morlog> takes some practice thogh to get the tuning right
[19:50:37] <murthy> C, C natural, C natural medium, C sharp, C + G
[19:50:55] <morlog> go for a c natural
[19:51:31] <morlog> are you playing just for yourself
[19:51:39] <morlog> like, something to do
[19:51:41] <murthy> There is Hindustani, Western, Carnatic
[19:51:50] <murthy> morlog: oh C natural
[19:51:55] <murthy> I mean ok
[19:52:21] <murthy> morlog: I want to learn for myself
[19:52:32] <morlog> cool
[19:53:00] <morlog> there are versions of that type of flute from pretty much every culture and they are all about the same
[19:53:09] <murthy> I am afraid my neighbours might complain
[19:53:39] <morlog> get yourself some river cane or bamboo and make your own
[19:53:48] <morlog> thoose arent very loud
[19:54:58] <morlog> easy to learn on too
[19:55:13] <murthy> morlog: oh I know for sure that making a music instrument is not that easy, it takes years for experience
[19:55:16] <morlog> only 1 scale makes it easy
[19:55:30] <morlog> those are easy to make
[19:55:52] <morlog> ive made several over the years
[19:57:50] <murthy> Oh wow
[19:58:31] <murthy> morf: also there is 5 holes and 8 holes ones, which one?
[19:58:37] <murthy> Oops
[19:58:39] <murthy> Sorry
[19:58:53] <murthy> morlog: ^
[19:59:01] <morlog> 5 is easier to learn but limits your range
[19:59:19] <morlog> 8 may give you another scale to work with
[19:59:31] <morlog> like a recorder
[19:59:35] <murthy> So 8 is future proof?
[19:59:50] <morlog> no
[19:59:55] <murthy> Ok
[20:00:24] <morlog> 8 is like double the range
[20:00:40] <morlog> usually 1 thumb hole and 7 finger holes
[20:00:58] <morlog> the thumb hole changes the scale
[20:01:45] <morlog> takes a bit more practice to learn
[20:02:15] <morf> sublim20: make 5 or 8 holes into murthy
[20:02:56] <murthy> :)
[20:03:29] <murthy> morlog: oh
[20:04:55] <morlog> the 5 and 8 hole ones are both just as fun playing
[20:05:48] <morlog> you might give a pennywhistle a try
[20:05:54] <morlog> those are fun
[20:07:06] <murthy> Ya
[20:07:59] <morlog> or a shakuhashi flute
[20:08:08] <morlog> those are also fun
[20:08:45] <morlog> beat someone up with one then play them a nice tune
[20:09:25] <morlog> one of those made out of stainless steel would be nice
[20:10:36] <murthy> One of the review says they ordered C medium but got B base
[20:11:00] <morlog> thats why i say make your own
[20:11:16] <morlog> those flutes are usually made in sweat shops
[20:11:17] <murthy> I am not sure how I will be able to identify it and I am also afraid I would train my ear badly
[20:11:38] <murthy> Ya but what about tuning?
[20:12:05] <morlog> you make them shorter until they are tuned
[20:12:23] <morlog> keep cutting or sanding a little bit off untill its in tune
[20:13:29] <murthy> Oh wow
[20:13:44] <murthy> This is very interesting

[20:41:26] <golrom> i prefer bamboo over pvc but a pvc one will probably last forever
[20:41:49] <golrom> a bamboo one, step on it or sit on it wrong once
[20:42:19] <golrom> also humidity can cause bamboo flutes to split
[20:42:42] <murthy> golrom: do bamboo flute and pvc sound the same?
[20:43:10] <murthy> also is there a danger or microplastic going into our respiratory system when pvc>
[20:43:11] <murthy> ?
[20:43:31] <murthy> If there is no danger I would like to buy the pvc

[21:26:55] <louipc> ok then no pvc
[21:27:22] <murthy> louipc: what do the musicians prefer pvc or wood?
[21:27:23] <louipc> pvc would last longer, but i guess wouldn't have as much a nice wood tone
[21:27:33] <louipc> murthy: probably wood
[21:27:51] <murthy> oh that means wood and pvc sound different?
[21:27:56] <louipc> but wood would require more attention and care
[21:28:08] <louipc> make sure to dry it out after use each time

[22:00:47] <louipc> murthy: no clue what scale it is. im not a flute guy
[22:01:02] <louipc> i just know if you get C scale its easier to transpose music
[22:01:11] <louipc> so better for beginner
[22:01:20] <murthy> louipc: ok
[22:02:26] <louipc> scale of the instrument doesn't really matter except in some edge cases
[22:02:46] <louipc> or for stuff like harmonica where scale means only certain chords can be played
[22:06:10] <murthy> louipc: I feel love in certain scales :)
[22:07:13] <louipc> you can still play C scale on Bb instrument and vise versa.. usually
[22:07:40] <louipc> it just maybe slightly confusing for beginner
[22:08:22] <louipc> so if you are learning an instrument in a different scale as beginner you will just pretend your instrument is in C
[22:08:47] <murthy> ya :)

[22:08:52] <louipc> and all the music  written for that instrument will appear like that

[22:08:56] <murthy> check out that flute on that one
[22:09:06] <murthy> its probably close to g
[22:09:13] <louipc> but then it becomse confusing when you need to play with other instruments in different scales
[22:09:24] <murthy> ya
[22:10:37] <louipc> its very difficult to tell just by listening. you need to see the person fingering, see the instrument, at the same time as listening
[22:10:52] <murthy> oh
[22:11:21] <murthy> macrobat said you can tell the scale just by listening and asked me to train my ears
[22:13:19] <murthy> I am going to buy my 2yr old nephew a tiny casio keyboard
[22:13:47] <louipc> you can tell the scale of the music but not necessarily scale of the instrument
[22:14:30] <louipc> unless you go to the extreme ranges of the instrument hard to tell
[22:15:19] <louipc> murthy: im talking about within the same range tho
[22:16:14] <louipc> obviously a baritone flute would be easy to tell from a piccolo

[22:36:54] <sublim20> i was at that band camp efex
[22:36:57] <sublim20> we all remember you
[22:37:15] <efex> the cheap was was way  easier to play, dammit I should have just kept it
[22:37:21] <efex> lol
[22:37:43] <louipc> efex: lol im talking indian dollars btw. so 1000 is like 20 bucks
[22:38:19] <efex> mm ok
[22:38:20] <louipc> 14 bucks hueh
[22:38:30] <efex> I am talking canadian $
[22:38:49] <louipc> but yea used stuff can be quality stuff

[22:40:24] <sublim20> never heard of them
[22:40:31] <sublim20> post dem links maaang
[22:40:35] <efex> because so far I have found new cars to be a better deal as far as overall cost, when you factor in repairs, personaly
[22:40:48] <sublim20> now a days, hell yeah
[22:41:02] <sublim20> used cars were a better deal, assuming you did your own work
[22:41:04] <efex> louipc: I am picking up my new car on friday! car on the mid
[22:41:13] <murthy> DOMF: hi
[22:41:15] <murthy> efex: hi
[22:41:23] <DOMF> sublim20 you've never heard of Jawbreaker? :( 
[22:41:30] <sublim20> nah
[22:41:32] <DOMF> Have you ever heard of "emo"?
[22:41:34] <efex> I quit doing my own work long ago… gimme something that just works :-)
[22:41:37] <murthy> efex: people have recommended be c natural scale for flute
[22:41:49] <sublim20> yes, isn't emo what the goths eventually evolved into
[22:41:49] <efex> murthy: hey :-)
[22:41:57] <murthy> louipc: I am going to buy two flutes
[22:42:07] <murthy> one c natural and one g natural
[22:42:09] <efex> what kind of flute are you talking?
[22:42:16] <DOMF> sublim20 no
[22:42:20] <murthy> efex: Indian Bansuri
[22:42:30] <DOMF> it's a common misconception that emo came from the goth scene but it came from the punk scene
[22:42:39] <DOMF> specifically, from Jawbreaker and from Sunny Day Real Estate
[22:42:41] <sublim20> my understanding of emo was, punk rock for emotional cry babies

[22:42:55] <sublim20> apologies if you find that offense, but that's what i thought of it
[22:42:57] <efex> normal flutes do every scale… are talking about a fipple type flute?
[22:43:05] <DOMF> lol no that's p spot on
[22:43:22] <efex> aha fine.. C is great then sure
[22:43:24] <murthy> efex: fipple type?
[22:43:33] <DOMF> I'm not really a huge fan of the genre with the exception of the two bands I mentioned lol
[22:43:38] <DOMF> I like some Weezer
[22:43:42] <murthy> efex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri
[22:43:42] <Janet> ^ A bansuri is a side blown flute originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is an aerophone produced from bamboo, used in Hindustani classical music.
[22:43:43] <murthy> that one
[22:43:47] <DOMF> oh and Thrice
[22:43:51] <sublim20> during the mid 90s onward, it seemed that punk rock got mainstream by branching out into subgenres
[22:44:03] <sublim20> pop punk (greenday / offspring)  and emo
[22:44:09] <DOMF> it did that before that
[22:44:19] <sublim20> im a 90s child
[22:44:21] <DOMF> but yeah
[22:44:23] <DOMF> lol
[22:44:33] <murthy> wow I think I made a mistake
[22:44:33] <DOMF> can't forget hardcore
[22:44:37] <efex> A”The term fipple specifies a variety of end-blown flute that includes the tin whistle and the recorder. Th"
[22:44:50] <sublim20> my understanding of 80s music is what they put on those variety cassettes you could find at kmart for like 5 bucks
[22:44:52] <murthy> I think I also need to buy a D or E scale
[22:45:06] <murthy> efex: oh ok, not that one
[22:45:11] <sublim20> they never put any punk of those cassettes
[22:45:35] <sublim20> punk music always seemed to find people through word of mouth, or someone just copying cds onto cassettes and sharing them
[22:46:17] <sublim20> besides the basics of punk rock, i dont really know the genre
[22:46:22] <efex> so what kind of a flute? got a link?

[22:49:08] <efex> Those flutes are lovely
[22:49:12] <sublim20> is it a full reunion?
[22:49:20] <sublim20> that dude that started epitaph gonna be in it?
[22:49:43] <murthy> efex: ya
[22:50:17] <efex> bbiab
[22:50:27] <DOMF> sublim20 the dude that started epitaph was brett from Bad Religion 
[22:50:33] <DOMF> nothing to do with operation ivy
[22:50:36] <sublim20> oh
[22:50:37] <sublim20> OH
[22:50:42] <sublim20> operation ivy is getting back together
[22:50:49] <sublim20> not bad religion.  ok.
[22:50:50] <DOMF> did you think I meant a BR reunion?
[22:50:52] <sublim20> yeah
[22:50:54] <DOMF> BR never broke up LOL
[22:51:01] <sublim20> well, the dude that started epitaph isn't in it
[22:51:12] <DOMF> they've been consistently touring and putting out albums since the early 80s
[22:51:17] <sublim20> yeah
[22:51:20] <DOMF> <sublim20> well, the dude that started epitaph isn't in it <-- he is, on and off
[22:51:24] <sublim20> i was confused by what you work
[22:51:27] <sublim20> *wrote
[22:51:34] <sublim20> that makes so much more sense
[22:51:36] <DOMF> one of the last two times I saw them play he was with them
[22:51:45] <sublim20> pretty influential man
[22:52:06] <sublim20> not just for the band, but the label
[22:52:37] <DOMF> too bad he's a royal dickhead
[22:52:37] <sublim20> the punk rock, DIY is very commendable.  always loved that about punk
[22:52:42] <sublim20> is he?
[22:52:44] <sublim20> didn't know that
[22:52:46] <DOMF> he absolutely is
[22:52:50] <DOMF> it's sad
[22:53:02] <sublim20> the good ones don't last 
[22:53:10] <DOMF> like tons of people talk about it, and you can see it yourself every time he's in a documentary about anything
[22:53:20] <DOMF> it's like a Neil Degrasse Tyson level of dickheadery

[23:21:01] <DOMF> cause he thought I was an op
[23:21:33] <DOMF> he was complaining about being silenced for talking about music... which it looks like something that did happen but I can't do anything about the mod double standards here
[23:21:34] <DOMF> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:31:20] <louipc> that dude needs to chill
[23:31:28] <sublim20> just mute him

[23:33:15] <sublim20> you can block pms 
[23:33:24] <sublim20> from certain people, depends on your irc client.
[23:33:40] <sublim20> i just block everyone though,  cause i kept getting these fucked up external link pm's
[23:33:53] <louipc> i cant block pms for everyone. so i rather not him use the channel list to start harassing ppl in pm
[23:34:04] <sublim20> heavy lies the crown
[23:34:17] <sublim20> thanks for modding though
[23:34:33] <murthy> DOMF: back with that story again?
[23:34:45] <murthy> mod double standards
