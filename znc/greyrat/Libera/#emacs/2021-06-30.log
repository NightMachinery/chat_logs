[01:13:46] <lisp123_> Minor modes may bind commands to key sequences consisting of C-c followed by a punctuation character. However, sequences consisting of C-c followed by one of {}<>:;, or a control character or digit, are reserved for major modes. Also, C-c letter is reserved for users. 
[01:14:09] <plugd> Ok, I'm stumped.  I have an arbitrary number of distinct classes of text displayed in a buffer, and I want to be able to assign different faces to one or more of them, changeable at run time. I was hoping to do this _without_ having to iterate over the buffer every time the faces changed; perhaps by dynamically fiddling with face attributes.  But there doesn't seem to be a way to define new faces at runtime, which would be necessary for
[01:14:09] <lisp123_> What does that mean? C-c M-[x] (where x is a letter), I understand is reserved for major modes

[01:16:15] <dale> lisp123_: Where did you see that C-c M-[letter] is reserved for major modes?
[01:16:39] <plugd> (by "arbitrary number" I mean somewhere between 1 and 20, but there's no hard upper bound)
[01:16:45] <dale> lisp123_: From the passage you pasted, I'd say C-c C-[stuff] is reserved for major modes, but I don't see C-c M-[stuff] from that.
[01:17:31] <lisp123_> I asked before here, and people said that - but to be fair I think they said C-c C-[stuff] is definitely major modes and they sort of through C-c M-[stuff] in there - is M-[stuff] a control character?
[01:18:21] <dale> lisp123_: I do not think of M-[stuff] as a control character, where M stands for "meta".  I think of "control character" as, mostly, characters that you generate by holding control plus a letter or (I guess) digit. :)

[05:06:00] <didi> NFS over wireguard sounds like a nice use of wireguard. The onedrive client doesn't like when more than one server uses the same credentials. My plan is to use only one server to synchronize using the onedrive client and the others mount a NFS from it.

And we write detailed specifications of what the code should be, and we call those things 'languages'.  But something that's plumbing the depths of the corpus of already-written code that's out there, and markov-chaining it into something we'd then put in our new projects, is deadly lunacy."

[09:13:48] <Wafficus> yeah its way too easy to dox people on GitHub, I'm good
[09:14:03] <Wafficus> I stay away from that BS
[09:14:03] <aidalgol> Wafficus: uh huh...
[09:14:06] <bkhl> I certainly see it a lot in my business that people by cloud services to do media analysis and such that's already available as locally running, often open source, programs.
[09:14:15] <Wafficus> aidalgol yep
[09:14:26] <dale> bkhl: I think the lock-in is "VS Code only".  I am guessing the remote-ness is probably somewhat for practicality, but also because they say they want to charge for it in some way in the future, I believe.
[09:14:43] <Wafficus> FTP is fine by me, its just to download stuff. I like the look of it, and the one way street it provides. Its great
[09:14:48] <bkhl> dale, alright, so a lockin strategy then. :-)
[09:15:00] <dale> bkhl: Oh, right, yes. :)
[09:15:08] <bkhl> I work with FTP a lot professionally and it still definitely has completely valid use cases.
[09:15:17] <bkhl> And it's not just a one way street, FXP is a thing. :-)
[09:15:29] <dale> bkhl: My vague recollection of these sorts of things is that they do have fairly sizeable data files, FWIW.  It might be slow but I kind of doubt it.
[09:15:42] <dale> bkhl: Also, online-only means they can collect analytics.  And, like, your code.
[09:15:52] <codingquark> Good morning!
[09:15:57] <Wafficus> I have different goals though. I just am not interested in bloated web development. I tried to reason putting time to learning it, but my heart is just not into ruining the web further
[09:16:00] <Wafficus> to each his own
[09:16:09] <Wafficus> I'd rather learn some Elisp and tweak Org Mode though
[09:16:14] <Wafficus> that's something I absolutely love
[09:16:16] <aidalgol> ,shit#emacssays is also I'm at the point where I literally probably will host an FTP site for completed projects, and just keep git repos on separate machines public git repos are dumb

[11:40:01] <libertyprime> just more parameters. ive also been looking at githubs semantic parser and facebooks duckling for a few years now

[11:40:43] <libertyprime> the entire user interface can be imagined for something like VI i have tried to demonstrate this
[11:41:15] <libertyprime> so to preserve the emacs fractal a mode must be made which connects things like autocomplete and contextual actions to prompts

[11:50:42] <boeg> I have gpg-agent + ssh + pinentry-gtk-2 working on my system, but i am unable to get it to work with emacs. What i mean is, if I try to do something that requires ssh in emacs (like git push with magit) BEFORE I have authenticated with gpg-agent, then it fails. Emacs just says I dont have permission, and doesnt prompt for a password or show the pinentry or anything. However if I authenticate outside emacs, then inside emacs, gpg-agent 
[11:50:42] <boeg> works and lets me push and so on. Its just the "pinentry part" that isn't working. I have tried with the pinentry package as well as "allow-emacs-pinentry" is my gpg-agent.conf. Not working. Any ideas?

[15:00:24] <bpalmer> treflip: ah. Weird; I'm curious what the mechanism is for that, but I only quickly skimmed the mode-local
[15:00:50] <bpalmer> what it had appeared to do was to iterate over all open buffers that are in that mode and call setq-local on the variable in there.
[15:01:11] <bpalmer> (which is what you should do manually if setq-mode-local is throwing a file check in it)
[15:01:26] <bpalmer> also, you'd want to add a function that does the setq-local to your mode hook

[17:59:19] <teknikal_domain> Mmm, perfect.
[17:59:31] <teknikal_domain> As borderless as I can probably get.
[18:00:38] <grym> i3 and fullscreen and no borders and no windows and no nothing is very good :) 
[18:00:51] <teknikal_domain> Eh, that's for the other partition on this laptop
[18:01:05] <teknikal_domain> (that I'm totally not procrastinating re-loading arch/i3 on)
[18:01:37] <grym> haha
[18:02:42] <teknikal_domain> I unironically have one partition that's linux mint, where I make heavy use of emacs, and another, that's LARBS arch.
[18:03:02] <teknikal_domain> If I'm not making people question my intelligence and/or sanity, I'm not doing it right.
[18:03:03] <grym> work seems to converge on ubuntu 
[18:03:05] <grym> i'll deal 
[18:03:30] <teknikal_domain> Well, only like 1/3 of my machines are ubuntu based
[18:03:44] <teknikal_domain> the others run Manjaro (Plasma) and OS X
[18:04:10] <grym> yeah.  i just "need" some ppas basically, and we ship 18.04 docker 
[18:04:19] <grym> so i might as well know my way around and at least it's not RPM 
[18:04:26] <teknikal_domain> Let me tell you, adapting my elisp to be platform agnostic was fun because I forgot that OS X doesn't have the same folder structure
[18:04:47] <grym> haha yeah...
[18:05:16] <teknikal_domain> Naturally, the moment I hard-code `/home/tekdmn` and OS X fails because it's at `/Users/tekdmn`...

[22:05:23] <technomancy> I had 80k a while back in my mu4e maildir and it started getting slow so I archived everything older than 2y; now I think it's down to 15k or so.
[22:05:42] <didi> Life is lighter when we delete old email.

[22:15:14] <didi> One oddity is that GNUs counts time since email arrival, not email existence. So if you fetch mail now, even if old mail, GNUs will start counting since now.
[22:16:07] <wgreenhouse> didi: I guess the alternative could result in mail being downloaded and instantly disappearing due to an expiry rule

[22:46:50] <wasamasa> technomancy: wow, the debbugs thing about lisp-mode
[22:46:56] <Ggguuueeesssttt> What was the context?
[22:47:15] <wasamasa> technomancy: if they want a less confusing name than lisp-data-mode for a mode to derive a lisp mode from, then how about... common-lisp-mode

[22:48:03] <technomancy> wasamasa: omg I was sooooo tempted to say that
[22:48:14] <wasamasa> clearly nobody wants common-lisp-mode
[22:48:14] <technomancy> what if we had a common mode ... for lisps?
[22:48:18] <twrk> Ggguuueeesssttt: the foot clan is ordered to take out april o'neill by shredder and this is their first encounter... from the 1990s tmnt movie
[22:48:30] <oats> technomancy, ooooh we could call it "common lisp mode"
[22:48:35] <oats> that wouldn't be at all confusing
[22:48:38] <wasamasa> fuck CL people and their claim to the lisp name
[22:49:28] <technomancy> wasamasa: and then stefan is off on this whole rabbit trail about "here's all the ways that maclisp diverges from CL"
[22:49:32] <wasamasa> I think the correct response to .l, .lsp and .lisp being burgled for CL things is to rebind it to lisp-data-mode
