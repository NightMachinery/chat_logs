[04:23:04] <rewt> re101-macaw-85:  https://regex101.com/r/3YokeQ/2  and you may want to fix that OCR; there are multiple places where it has I instead of 1, and different types of dashes
[04:27:08] <re101-macaw-85> Thanks for thios one. But I am looking for regex to match each column seperately
[04:27:22] <re101-macaw-85> Like 5 different regex for 5 columns'
[04:28:55] <rewt> why?  the regex returns the 5 columns as separate elements
[04:31:32] <rewt> if you really need separate regexes, can you please say ALL relevant information/details, because a slight change in requirements can have drastic effects on the answer, and speaking from experience, it takes way too much time and effort to adjust for each tiny detail
[04:42:49] <re101-macaw-85> I am using document understanding concept in uipath
[04:43:45] <re101-macaw-85> they I have to capture individual columns
[04:45:09] <re101-macaw-85> the regex you gave we can capture all at a time and split them but the coding in it strict to certain format

[04:47:31] <rewt> the regex currently has 5 sets of (...) -- change all of them EXCEPT 1 to  (?:...)  to have only that excepted column captured; so you'll have 5 regexes, each of them with 1 set of (...) and 4 sets of (?:...)

[04:51:35] <re101-macaw-85> Can you send an example of capturing 1st column
[04:51:44] <rewt> see the first set of (...)
[04:51:55] <rewt> change all other sets of (...) to (?:...)
[04:52:22] <re101-macaw-85> (.*?[-—].*?|Total)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)$
[04:52:43] <re101-macaw-85> not getting you sorry
[04:52:54] <re101-macaw-85> which one to add ?
[04:54:07] <rewt> by set of (...) I mean (.*?[-—].*?|Total) and all the (\S+)
[04:54:21] <rewt> add ?: to the front so (...) becomes (?:...)
[04:55:05] <rewt> so to capture the first one ("change all of them EXCEPT 1 to  (?:...)  to have only that excepted column captured")... change all the (\S+) to (?:\S+)

[05:02:17] <re101-macaw-85> please send for 1 please
[05:02:40] <re101-macaw-85> its brain storming for me really sorry
[05:09:40] <rewt> I don't understand why you find this so difficult.... if we take /(.*?[-—].*?|Total)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)$/ and replace all except the first set of (...), meaming all (\S+) with (?:...), meaning (?:\S+), we end up with /(.*?[-—].*?|Total)\s+(?:\S+)\s+(?:\S+)\s+(?:\S+)\s+(?:\S+)$/
[05:10:46] <rewt> it's literally what I said in my last message: change all the (\S+) to (?:\S+)
[05:11:14] <re101-macaw-85> But if I use thAT I am not getting the expected result
[05:11:25] <re101-macaw-85> https://regex101.com/r/6C0Z60/1
[05:13:48] <rewt> you removed the /g and /m flags...
[05:13:55] <rewt> i didn't say to do that :(
[05:16:10] <re101-macaw-85> There are no /g and /m flags in the first link as well
[05:17:42] <rewt> yes there are

[21:28:54] <salitos> Hi! I've been solving a catastrophic backtracking problem by using atomic groups in java, Initially I had one atomic group for the whole regex, the backtracking problem persisted, but now, having by trial and error cut the regex into 3 atomic groups, i notice it has disappeared. I can't figure out what I might have initiated by using 3 atomic groups, I only know the atomic group will be considered as one unit whanever the regex engine finds no match at 
[21:28:54] <salitos> some point in the string and backtracks, hence why I used one initially. Can anyone more experienced spot holes and perhaps educate on why my trial and error might've worked, thanks

[21:50:52] <OnlineCop> salitos: Does your original 1-atomic-group regex show where it catostrophically backtracks within the Regex Debugger?
[21:53:31] <salitos> i'm not sure intellij has a regex debugger, otherwise, it does not show any error when it catastrophically backtracks, just takes forever to run.
[21:54:08] <rewt> by "one atomic group for the whole regex", do you mean you had the whole regex in an atomic group?
[21:55:12] <salitos> yes rewt: i enclosed the whole regex in (?>regx) at first
[21:56:21] <rewt> that won't prevent backtracking... regex won't backtrack INTO an atomic group, but it can still backtrack while it's still inside
[21:59:17] <rewt> simple demo: have a look at the steps in the debugger for https://regex101.com/r/SONBP7/1
[21:59:18] <salitos> rewt: hmm okay, so i have to somehow make sure it "gets out" of any regex group unit that may cause catastrophic backtracking?
[21:59:38] <rewt> yes
[22:01:11] <salitos> so any group i put inside an atomic group should not be able to cause catastrophic backtracking itself?
[22:01:28] <rewt> depends on what it is
[22:02:10] <salitos> rewt: could you please elaborate on that last
[22:02:32] <rewt> atomic group just means the group itself is atomic and backtracking will backtrack over the whole group instead of going inside and trying to have it give up something it matched
[22:02:53] <rewt> if there's a lot of backtracking inside the atomic group, that can still cause catastrophic backtracking
[22:04:11] <rewt> as you noticed with your original attempt, the whole regex was inside an atomic group, yet it was still catastrophic
[22:05:19] <rewt> you can think of atomic groups as "once this group matched something, it cannot give up any part of it to help the rest of the regex match"
[22:05:42] <salitos> I think I have gotten what you said, in a way we can think of each regex particle in an unatomically grouped regex as atomic so in making it 'too atomic' we are going back to our original problem? 
[22:06:49] <rewt> yes, in a way.... /abc/ is really the same as /(?>a)(?>b)(?>c)/ since each charater you're matching is an atom, so putting each one in an atomic group doesn't change anything
[22:07:52] <rewt> an atomic group just groups multiple atoms into one larger atom that cannot be broken up
[22:08:50] <rewt> so the same way backtracking cannot backtrack into half of a single character, it cannot backtrack into half (or any part) of an atomic group
[22:12:16] <salitos> thanks :rewt, I've reread this thread and really you've explained this very well, nice to have my eyes open and thanks again.
[22:21:58] <rewt> np :)
