[03:31:36] <nova> when pcall returns error message as 2nd param, it seems rather difficult to parse the file, line number, etc out. A directory can have a space, for example, and who knows what else. I guess you can find pattern ':%d:' thing string.sub if the error message starts with os.getenv'HOME', but is there a better way?
[03:32:20] <nova> here's a typical error message: /home/nova/.config/nvim/foo.lua:2: the error message
[03:35:24] <nova>  hmm actually message could just check if the first char is '/' (eg could be error in /usr/share/bla/bla), but still seems janky

[03:41:53] <nova> I think I will still get the same error message. it will just be forwarded to the function as the first param instead of returned as second arg from pcall, right? Let me try on a real example ..
[03:44:58] <nova> bfredl, well, I get the same message as a string. local success = pcall(require, function(errmsg) print(errmsg) end, param1) vs local success, errmsg = pcall(require, param1) print(errmsg)
[03:45:47] <nova> the problem is that the error message has everything concatenated together and so I have to parse it, which is fine but I was wondering if there was a more concise way

[04:28:57] <nova> daaang I just cleaned up so much junky string parsing and improved it three-fold. thanks a lot. I have one minor problem remaining, but I think it's probably good enough
[04:29:43] <nova> if you just throw `print` in a lua file and try to require it, then the file doesn't show up in the stack trace. in fact, the only way to actually get the file is from the error message itself.
[04:32:31] <nova> instead, you get this: source = "@vim/_load_package.lua", short_src = "vim/_load_package.lua", what = "Lua", etc. I can handle that separately and do the janky string parsing atop this debug stuff lol
[04:33:48] <ii14[m]> it works for me
[04:35:09] <nova> I required 'foo' from lua/foo.lua then required 'foo bar/foo.lua' from lua/foo bar/foo.lua and I got that
[04:35:15] * ii14[m] sent a lua code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/98c0be1d345981d52727a3daa688ce349e6bd7ab
[04:35:53] <nova> then lua/foo bar/foo.lua has the single print, and then I get nothing in debug.info about foo bar/foo.lua but instead the weird vim/_load_package
[04:38:35] <nova> https://i.imgur.com/BeH8WuR.png  lua/init/foo.lua gets picked up automatically by this thing I am writing and has the xpcall called on it
[04:39:32] <nova> specifically, xpcall(requrie, function() .. end, 'lua/init/foo') for this case
[04:40:50] <nova> and here is every vim.inspect( debug.getinfo(i) )  http://pastie.org/p/7su038ByKnzeAF32C8tZob
[04:41:28] <nova> if you search for "foo bar" in the paste, you'll see that only the error message at the top has that file naem
[04:41:37] <nova> s/naem/name/
[04:43:15] <ii14[m]> well okay, the problem here is that it's a syntax error, the file is never actually evaluated and therefore it does not appear on the stack
[04:43:29] <ii14[m]> it fails on the parsing stage
[04:44:01] <nova> got ya :) it works super well for everything that can actually load the lua file because it has no syntax errors.
[04:44:26] <nova> I kinda want to implement the janky string parsing for this one case. I guess I will do it
[04:46:24] <ii14[m]> yeah I'm not sure how to reliably detect this
[04:47:11] <nova> well, I have a lot of conditions for when to add an error to the list of errors that are then added to qf via vim.fn.setqflist
[04:47:21] <nova> if info.currentline ~= -1 and info.linedefined == 0 and info.short_src:sub(1, #init) ~= init and info.what == 'main' then
[04:47:26] <ii14[m]> you can with loadfile() and loadstring(), but require does this for you
[04:49:02] <nova> then I could just check if source:sub(1, 4) == '@vim'; if it is, then parse the error message for file? is that bad?
[04:50:37] <ii14[m]> vim.lua can do a bunch of things, so you can have potentially other errors coming from that place
[04:52:56] <nova> well, I guess I will leave it as is. The user can track it down in the quickfix list to the last require statement. I will need to do one last check though. If the lua/init/{file}.lua itself has a syntax error or fails to load, then no error message would be added, so I need to handle that separately, but that can be done not well but trivially enough
[04:53:01] <nova> thanks a lot ii14
[04:53:08] <ii14[m]> oh and forgot to mention, it's `vim.lua` for me, not `_load_package.lua`, so this clearly differs between versions

[04:57:03] <ii14[m]> no, nevermind
[04:58:57] <ii14[m]> I don't know how reliable that would be but maybe you can check if the second stack frame has `name = "require"`. the caveat is that it doesn't work when you call `require` through `xpcall`
[04:59:53] <ii14[m]> but in your case it's as the third stack frame, so probably not reliable
[05:00:56] <nova> I also skipped the first stack frame because
[05:01:02] <nova> forgot to mention. I started at 2
[05:01:31] <ii14[m]> yeah, that's fine
[05:01:55] <ii14[m]> first is debug.getinfo, second is the xpcall handler
[05:02:07] <ii14[m]> or something like that
[05:02:11] <nova> yeah said just so you weren't confused
[05:02:40] <ii14[m]> actually I think you should start at 3
[05:03:04] <nova> local i = 1 while do true debug.getinfo(i) end
[05:03:22] <nova> whoops. you know. I started at i = 1, did i = i + 1 then debug.getinfo
[05:04:41] <nova> http://ix.io/3S57/lua
[05:08:05] <ii14[m]> if you want to match the passed error message then `i` should be `2`

[07:58:32] <mjlbach[m]> No you don’t need to add a dependency
[07:58:56] <mjlbach[m]> You just need to copy/modify our omnifunc implementation
[07:59:05] <Soup[m]> Any guidance on this error when loading TS? http://0x0.st/oZOQ.txt Im at ts's HEAD and a few days back on nvim itself
[08:00:15] <haoliang[m]> mjlbach[m]: thanks, i will check it further.
[08:01:01] <Soup[m]> Not sure if `:checkhealth treesitter` is supposed to work or if that was some erroneous auto complete

[17:16:47] <jethro33> in my case it's not. i either use ctrlp or nerdtree to open my first file and it gets opened in a new buffer
[17:17:20] <jethro33> does it have to do with those 2 plugins configuration?
[17:17:21] <ii14[m]> so after that you have two buffers, empty and the one you just opened?

[17:19:34] <ii14[m]> it's not an empty buffer, I think it's the directory
[17:20:26] <ii14[m]> > I figured out how to disable netrw from loading on startup
[17:20:26] <ii14[m]> this is not how it works by default, it has most likely something to do with this
[17:20:36] <jethro33> ah, so maybe i should just run "vim" in the terminal instead of "vim ."
[17:20:43] <ii14[m]> yes
[17:21:19] <ii14[m]> vim already starts in the current working directory you're in

[17:22:31] <jethro33> i noticed i don't even have to disable netrw anymore, it doesn't show up if i just run vim

[23:07:58] <JulianJulianBerm> I'm using one of the more popular colorschemes :) (edge)
[23:08:11] <JulianJulianBerm> But I suppose that disqualifies my original question
[23:08:12] <JulianJulianBerm> Oh well.
[23:08:42] <JulianJulianBerm> The default groups aren't suitable enough
[23:08:45] *** Joins: mon_aaraj (~MonAaraj@user/mon-aaraj/x-4416475)
[23:08:47] <JulianJulianBerm> So back somewhat to the drawing board.
[23:09:15] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[23:09:17] <clason[m]> You can assign colours to the filetype specific ones, too
[23:09:48] <JulianJulianBerm> As in right after I define my ft specific ones, give them colors in the syntax file
[23:09:49] <JulianJulianBerm> ?
[23:09:53] <ii14[m]> doesn't matter if it's suitable, just get it roughly right
[23:10:12] *** Quits: M4rty (~M4rtyflex@91-166-220-92.subs.proxad.net) (Quit: leaving)
[23:10:16] <ii14[m]> for example onedark.vim overwrites these groups for some of the languages
[23:10:21] <clason[m]> No, not the syntax file
[23:10:42] <clason[m]> Put it in a ColorScheme autocommand
[23:11:34] <JulianJulianBerm> Is that basically because after that fires the colorscheme-specific colors are now accessible?
[23:11:39] <clason[m]> No
[23:11:40] <JulianJulianBerm> (if so yeah that's probably what I'm after)
[23:11:43] *** Quits: bubbler_ (~bubbler@2a02:810d:8cc0:3fa0:94d0:5356:d215:5112) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[23:11:59] <clason[m]> Any syntax group you define is available for colorschemes

[23:12:14] <clason[m]> They can "break" the links 
[23:12:20] <JulianJulianBerm> Sorry, I still don't follow then
[23:12:28] <JulianJulianBerm> Right, that makes sense, now how do I give good defaults
[23:12:48] <ii14[m]> link them to default groups
[23:12:49] <clason[m]> Link to standard groups
[23:12:56] <JulianJulianBerm> And if the standard groups don't work well?
[23:13:02] <clason[m]> That's all you can do
[23:13:06] <JulianJulianBerm> 85% of the file is "Function", it's a sea of purple
[23:13:28] <ii14[m]> you can overwrite those links as a user or colorscheme
[23:13:42] <clason[m]> That's on the colour scheme
[23:14:08] <ii14[m]> see onedark.vim: https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim/blob/main/colors/onedark.vim#L517
[23:14:47] <JulianJulianBerm> Thanks for your help, I'll keep thinking.
[23:15:05] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Quit: 404)
[23:15:45] <ii14[m]> I guess you could just define colors, but it will look like garbage on any colorscheme other than the one you're using
[23:15:59] <ii14[m]> that's your only two options
[23:16:38] <JulianJulianBerm> Right, my guess instead on what others have done here is to ignore some of the semantic meaning of stuff
[23:16:52] <JulianJulianBerm> And instead try to fake things such that they have similar "distributions" of tokens
[23:17:10] <sunjonSenghanBri> my colorscheme has a list of ~30 named colors
[23:17:26] <JulianJulianBerm> So still bind to the builtin groups, but if `Function` is too common, you use something else. So probably I should peek at say the Haskell syntax plugin.
[23:17:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> and I mapped everything to those in the colorscheme
[23:18:00] <sunjonSenghanBri> like almost 2 shades of 16 colors, so doubling up on what would be in a minimal colorscheme
[23:18:14] <JulianJulianBerm> I'm not really worried about myself, I can make things look good
[23:18:24] *** Joins: zenof (~zenofthin@88.130.155.194)
[23:18:32] <JulianJulianBerm> My users though likely cannot, so I'd like them to have good defaults, without saying "use this colorscheme" unless I really have to.
[23:18:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> is this for a plugin?
[23:18:59] <JulianJulianBerm> Yes.
[23:19:11] <ii14[m]> you don't necessarily have to like to Function if it's a function, I guess
[23:19:19] <ii14[m]> s/like/link/
[23:19:35] <ii14[m]> I think it's fine to take some liberties with that
[23:19:41] <JulianJulianBerm> (Specifically https://github.com/Julian/lean.nvim/blob/main/syntax/lean3.vim -- which as I say leads to a color distribution I'm not very fond of at the minute)
[23:21:53] <JulianJulianBerm> Yeah exactly, maybe if I just loosen some definitions I'll be happier
[23:22:23] <JulianJulianBerm> I see Haskell binds nothing to Function
[23:22:38] <JulianJulianBerm> Which makes sense-ish
