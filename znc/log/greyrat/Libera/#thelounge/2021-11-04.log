[06:09:49] <termer> If I install the deb, there's no possible damage to database or media, right?

[06:18:13] <MaxLeiter> I'll let someone with more knowledge on debs answer, but I've never had a problem with a pre-release and media or db

[10:46:21] <fnutt> So sad to see https://git.io/JO6S9 bring closed. 😞
[10:47:19] <fnutt> I was really crossing my fingers for it to be included. Been using the PR for ages now and it does work - it just needs the animation. 
[10:47:44] <kuroshi> I still have the weird keyboard popout issue on iPad
[10:47:46] <bookworm> can always be reopened if someone wants to work on it
[10:48:14] <bookworm> kuroshi: no one said it's fixed ;)
[10:48:18] <kuroshi> click the keyboard's own hide button, it pops away, but the app pops down a bit and pops back up into keyboard position
[10:48:32] <kuroshi> but tapping within the chat view makes it hide properly
[10:48:35] <fnutt> Sure, but it is wayyy less likely to happen now since the pr has been closed. 😕
[10:49:48] <johncs> if it makes you feel better fnutt, i'm interested in that one and will probably implement it at some point
[10:50:25] <johncs> bugs me somewhat regularly on my phone
[10:50:36] <bookworm> fnutt: considering the non activity since ages even when open I fail to see how it makes a difference
[10:50:57] <fnutt> Good to hear, johncs. 
[10:52:15] <fnutt> It needs the animation and click-somewhere-to-close. That’s it. 
[10:52:50] <bookworm> sounds easy then, send a patch ;P
[10:56:46] <petteri> btw, the reaction/reply thing was really nice. Will it be on the 4.3.0 or was just a proof of concept or similar?
[10:57:26] <bookworm> it's a wip on johns computer,  not a PR
[10:57:32] <johncs> I don't know whether it'll be in 4.3.0 because that doesn't have a release date. But it's not a proof of concept. It'll get into the lounge eventually.
[10:57:44] <bookworm> it's also unsupported on probably all networks you are on too
[10:57:58] <petteri> nice 👍 thanks for the info

[15:18:21] <Exterminador> wodim: you can install TheLounge as a PWA
[15:19:34] <wodim> no pwas on ios afaik
[15:20:16] <Exterminador> can't answer that, since I've never used iOS
[15:21:21] <wodim> oh, wait
[15:21:27] <d4n13L> wodim: you can just place it on your home screen
[15:21:31] <wodim> https://www.appirc.com/
[15:21:33] <wodim> anybody tried this?
[15:21:41] <wodim> d4n13L, yeah but no notifications...
[15:22:06] <Activ8> Don’t use that it’s not maintained
[15:22:09] <Jay2k1> last we checked, appirc was not working and a dead project
[15:22:19] <wodim> alright
[15:22:33] <d4n13L> oh well, I have notifications disabled for everything, never noticed :)
[15:22:53] <Activ8> It’s an app in itself there’s no real need to use an app
[15:22:54] <Jay2k1> push notifications on ios could be made by running TL behind znc and using its *push module
[15:23:01] <Jay2k1> that supports telegram and a bunch of others
[15:28:01] <wodim> mostly looking to alternatives to irccloud
[15:28:05] <wodim> for*
[15:34:22] <Exterminador> exception for the notifications, TL is a good replacement to IRCCloud
[15:34:56] <wodim> thank you, i think i will consider it since i dont really need notifications, although its a nice thing to have
[15:35:16] <wodim> my alternative is writing a keepalive script for irccloud or something since they disconnect you constantly :)
[15:42:46] <Activ8> You don’t get disconnected with the lounge the server is always connected until you either have a network problem or disconnect manually
[15:44:46] <wodim> sorry, i was talking about irccloud there
[15:55:14] <Jay2k1> yeah their free tier disconnects you after 4h of inactivity or something
[15:56:02] <wodim> what i meant is that an alternative is writing something that keeps you connected

[23:49:46] <xnaas> oh
[23:49:50] <Activ8> someone stole it

[23:50:04] <xnaas> Activ8: that's what I was concerned about! Where is 5? Who hurt it?! :P
[23:50:40] <Activ8> hehe
[23:59:45] <MaxLeiter> xnaas: I released a second deb package of pre-4 by accident as pre-5 and it got uploaded to thelounges pre-5
