[00:05:16] <earnestly> Why would it be
[00:05:18] <phy1729> The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expansion.

[00:11:32] <earnestly> dob1: There basically so no scope
[00:11:58] <phy1729> by default there is no scope. If you use local it's dynamically scoped (iirc)
[00:12:08] <earnestly> dob1: By sourcing a file, all of its contents will be available to the proceeding code.  bash does have the concept of 'local' for functions, but besides that, it's all exposed

[04:32:19] <Al2O3> anyone here using imgbb to host images via curl and post messaging?
[04:33:25] <Al2O3> I would like to directly deposit images into a folder, instead it seems all images posted to imgbb api automatically go to the home directory of the user account, but that is not shareable, but albums are.

[04:37:46] <Al2O3> sadly there is not a ##imgbb channel to the best of my knowledge, and would hope someone can PM me and we can chat about it, since I am using bash to make the call/storage to imgbb.

[06:05:24] <Al2O3> issue is with a script that works fine using Terminal.app, but when directed to run from a crontab (using CronniX, a front end to personal/user crontabs on OSX [my case 10.6.8]), the script's call to curl doens't seem to work. I'm thinking that is environment related as it seems crontab is rather isolated.
[06:06:39] <Blondie101010> the environment is clearly the first thing to look at
[06:07:14] <Al2O3> did, and now that is the answer!
[06:07:28] <Blondie101010> it's usually preferable to find the problem more specifically

[06:07:42] <Al2O3> found out with 'port' installed, the certs are not valid, and the terminal is referencing /opt/local/bin/curl, and the cron environment is /usr/bin/curl
[06:07:56] <Al2O3> so, solved, env, TY Blondie101010
[06:07:59] <Blondie101010> but you can expect the difference to be in one of the shell login scripts
[06:08:10] <Blondie101010> ah good
[06:08:53] <Al2O3> yep, now working, all good
[06:09:06] <Al2O3> now that is nice, have a great day to all willing to try and help.

[07:07:15] <jensen> actually yea, i don't think firefox exits with a different status if it crashes. but that's a good idea, i was thinking of polling (which i hate) but i'm pretty sure inotify should be able to check for changes to the profile folder efficiently so that looks to be the answer
[07:07:56] <Blondie101010> so basically you begin by doing a scripts that gives you more details on what happens
[07:08:09] <Blondie101010> trap might catch it, or not

[13:42:28] <Soliton> !declare-n
[13:42:28] <greybot> "declare -n" tries to create a name reference to a variable. It's severely flawed: the variable is resolved by looking for a matching name using dynamic scope. See https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashProgramming#Functions and FAQ 48.
[13:42:46] <maroloccio> Thank you Soliton. I appreciate it.
[13:42:54] <maroloccio> So I guess this is fine, right? declare -A a=([x]=1); declare -A b=([x]=2); v=a; declare -n p=$v; echo "${p[@]}"
[13:43:11] <Soliton> no clue what v is for but sure.
[13:43:29] <maroloccio> v is the name of either a or b
[13:44:27] *** Joins: ManDay (~manday@user/manday)
[13:45:58] <ManDay> What's the correct way to loop over files in a specific order (esp. one which is supported by `ls`, in my case date)?
[13:46:22] <ManDay> Or is there no quick solution to that?
[13:46:24] <Soliton> !ls
[13:46:24] <greybot> DO NOT USE ls' output for anything. ls is a tool for interactively looking at directory metadata. Any attempts at parsing ls' output with code are broken. Globs are much more simple AND correct: ''for file in *.txt''. Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs
[13:46:34] <Soliton> if you have GNU ls there is an example there.
[13:49:24] <maroloccio> ManDay: you could also use stat --format=FORMAT for reliable parsing
[13:49:59] <ManDay> "Also"? Unless I misunderstood Soliton only told me *not* to use ls but did not propose a solution, right?
[13:50:34] <Soliton> you will have to open the link in a browser and read the page.
[13:50:34] <ManDay> The `stat` method would probably also count as "no quick solution" in my opinion.

[13:54:45] <tirnanog> I don't see how that solution can be endorsed with a straight face. use something like this instead: while IFS=/ read -rd '' _ path; do ...; done < <(find . -maxdepth 1 -printf '%T+/%p\0' | sort -z)

[13:57:59] <ManDay> So even with the ls which does the escaping (mine does), I still need something like an eval to read the output directly into a for loop, right?
[13:58:20] <ManDay> Because otherwise the spaces infere
[13:59:01] <tirnanog> yes. it's horrible and, if you have GNU, you certainly don't need it for sorting by timestamps.
[13:59:39] <ManDay> tirnanog: what do you mean by the latter?
[14:00:00] <tirnanog> surely my first response had to have counted for something.
[14:00:17] <ManDay> it has counted in so far as that I'm using it
[14:00:30] <tirnanog> ok. good.
[14:00:33] <ManDay> i was going to say thank you but allow me that question...?
[14:00:48] *** Joins: iomari891 (~iomari891@197.210.71.172)
[14:00:49] <tirnanog> well, that's the answer.
[14:00:55] <ManDay> Oh you meant your method is a viable alternative, thus I don't need it
[14:00:59] <ManDay> ok got it
[14:01:00] <tirnanog> you can control the format of find and it's never influenced by the locale.
[14:01:06] <ManDay> ty
[14:01:17] <tirnanog> in this case, the timestamps are lexically sortable. NUL is, of course, a safe delimiter.
[14:01:24] <tirnanog> so all of that brings it together.

[14:08:40] <Soliton> why is the filename relevant? the slash or any other character come before it.
[14:09:16] <ManDay> Heh, I just tried and the error from `touch 'test/file'` is indeed something I've never seen.
[14:09:26] <ManDay> And it's different from `touch 'test/'`
[14:10:24] <Soliton> neither of those need to be errors.
[14:10:42] <Soliton> of course the dir needs to exist.
[14:11:08] <tirnanog> jelly's observation is wholly germane to the solution I presented.
[14:11:37] <tirnanog> it's common to see examples that use other delimiters. let's take this as an example.
[14:11:41] <tirnanog> !gnufindsort
[14:11:41] <greybot> find . -type f -printf '%T+ %p\0' | sort -z | tr \\0 \\n

[14:11:59] <Soliton> and that's just fine as well.

[14:12:07] <Soliton> how so?
[14:12:09] <tirnanog> let me finish!
[14:12:11] *** Quits: mithrin (~mithrin@stip-static-62.213-81-207.telecom.sk) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:12:31] <tirnanog> it's fine for interactive use, yes. the problem would come if someone were to take an example like that and try and incorporate it into a read loop.
[14:12:50] <Soliton> what would be relevant IMO is rather how sort works in the current locale.
[14:12:57] <tirnanog> # mkdir ' dir'; touch ' dir'/f;  find ' dir' -type f -printf '%T+ %p\0' | sort -z | while IFS=' ' read -rd '' _ path; do declare -p path; done
[14:12:58] <shbot> tirnanog: declare -- path="dir/f"
[14:13:00] <tirnanog> wrong.
[14:13:09] <Soliton> like space is a valid separator for numbers in french.
[14:13:39] <tirnanog> # mkdir ' dir'; touch ' dir'/f;  find ' dir' -type f -printf '%T+/%p\0' | sort -z | while IFS=/ read -rd '' _ path; do declare -p path; done
[14:13:40] <shbot> tirnanog: declare -- path=" dir/f"
[14:13:42] <tirnanog> right.
[14:14:12] <Soliton> in your example you called find with . but ok.
[14:15:22] <ManDay> Soliton: Re "touch errors" ah of course, I turned my brain off there for a minute
[14:15:23] <Soliton> IFS whitespace is a problem either way though indeed.

[17:41:55] <greybot> Saying something "doesn't work" helps neither you or us. Explain the result you *want* or *expect*, what you are *doing* and *how* it is failing. Copy/paste the commands you use and the errors they produce. Consider set -x to get more information on what is happening.
[17:42:47] <emanuele6> `declare' is the same as `local' in a function. if you are trying to declare a global variable, use -g.

[19:53:15] <Masklin_Gurder> I'm confused
[19:53:30] <Masklin_Gurder> -k1,2 should mean sort on column 1 first, then on column 2, but I suppose it doesn't.
[19:53:40] <Soliton> !sort-k
[19:53:41] <greybot> To sort(1) on the second field: sort -k 2,2; This means "the sort key is field 2 only". sort -k 2 means "the sort key runs from the start of field 2 to the end of the line".
[19:54:04] <Soliton> you give multiple -k if you want to sort on multiple fields.
[19:54:07] <Masklin_Gurder> Why on Earth did they write it lik ethat
[19:54:11] <emg> Masklin_Gurder: not 1 then 2, start at 1 and keep going through characters/bytes until you finish 2
[19:54:31] <Soliton> well, with your idea what do you do if you want to sort on field 3 and 1?
[19:54:53] <Soliton> or 3, 1 and 5
[19:54:59] <Masklin_Gurder> -k3,1,5 obviously
[19:55:18] <emanuele6> that is not even valid...
[19:55:25] <Masklin_Gurder> I'll make it valid
[19:55:27] <tirnanog> note that no numeric sort key can be discerned in the -n -k1,2 case. the key will effectively be treated as 0.
[19:55:29] <emg> Masklin_Gurder: it doesn't answer all questions, but the POSIX man pages often have helpful/useful historical context in the Rationale section: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sort.html
[19:55:38] <emanuele6> # sort -k3,1,5 < /dev/null # Masklin_Gurder
[19:55:40] <shbot> emanuele6: sort: stray character in field spec: invalid field specification '3,1,5'
[19:56:30] <Masklin_Gurder> Right, well. So the correct way to do what I wanted is -k1,1 -k2,2 -n, ja?
[19:56:32] <libc> i repeat ...
[19:56:42] <libc> more precisely -k2,<last character of the field>
[19:56:48] <Soliton> if they're all numerical compares, yes.
[19:57:02] <Masklin_Gurder> Soliton: They're not, some are letters
[19:57:06] <Soliton> otherwise you can put n in the key definition.
[19:57:17] <emanuele6> Masklin_Gurder: if you want to sort first field 1 lexicographically first, then 2 numerically, use -k1,1 -k2,2n, not -n
[19:57:50] <Masklin_Gurder> geez
[19:58:00] <Soliton> libc: it's the field number not some character.
[19:58:30] <emanuele6> your understanding of -k was nonsensical, i don't know where you learned it worked like that
[19:58:54] <emanuele6> -k3,1,5 couldn't even appear to work, that is just invalid
[19:59:20] <emg> don't forget the fields for -k can be   field_number.first_character and field_number.last_character   just to make things more fun
[20:00:02] <emanuele6> you can also use b to skip blank character at the start of the field, etc
[20:00:21] <emg> also the type argument can be added to both the start and end fields, still reading to understand that
[20:01:33] <Masklin_Gurder> So sort -k1,1 -k2,2n is the final word, everyone agrees?
[20:02:31] <Masklin_Gurder> Means sort field 1 and only field 1 first, then sort a second time within each field1 group, using field 2 and only field 2, numerically. Y/n?

[21:47:04] <earnestly> zeev: git log | strip crlfs here | sort -u | wc -m
[21:47:09] <emanuele6> implementing an awk "without extensions" is a weird idea. you can write an awk script that is POSIX compliant
[21:47:27] <NRK[m]> ormaaj: it's not as bad as shell, yeah. also gawk has `--posix` flag which disables extensions.
