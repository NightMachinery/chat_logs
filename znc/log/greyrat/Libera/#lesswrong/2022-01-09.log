[00:00:03] <spxtr> omicron in healthy young boosted people seems pretty mild overall
[00:00:13] <Obormot\Gaia> It's much more serious when having it, takes much longer to recover from, and has serious long-term (possibly permanent) effects
[00:00:27] <Obormot\Gaia> There is no way it makes sense to risk it, just for a party
[00:00:34] <phill> anecdotally i've seen a pretty wide range
[00:00:38] <phill> of "mild"
[00:00:43] <spxtr> you could have made exactly that same argument about flu pre-covid
[00:00:45] <Obormot\Gaia> phill: I'm referring to the average case
[00:00:51] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: False, and you know it
[00:01:13] <catern> i never go to parties anyway; covid makes it hard to change that but that's fine
[00:01:45] <adiabatic> nobody talked about getting flu from being in large groups unless it was getting nerd flu at a con or osmething
[00:01:58] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: I've had the flu a lot of times and *somehow* never lost my sense of smell afterwards, nor any of the other effects... the comparison is nonsense, frankly
[00:02:39] <phill> i think the comparison ends after the "easily spread respiratory virus"
[00:02:44] <adiabatic> COVID has a longer thicker right tail of nasty effects
[00:03:20] <Obormot\Gaia> This "it's just a mild cold/flu" business really seems to me like a case of not wanting to admit the facts due to ... really liking parties? I guess? To the extent that you're willing to endanger yourself *and* everyone you come into contact with
[00:03:32] <Obormot\Gaia> It's a hard to understand perspective, that's for sure
[00:03:38] <spxtr> I've only had the flu twice and it was pretty brutal. Far worse than what I just had, and far worse than what the ~5 people I know who had omicron in the last few weeks had.
[00:03:46] <kuudes> current prior the national long covid research team annonced on yesterday here was that the acute effects of covid are about as large as long covid's effects
[00:03:51] <spxtr> (obvs that's anecdote, but that's my experience)
[00:03:55] <adiabatic> Obormot\Gaia: in most cases, it is Just The Flu™
[00:04:02] <Obormot\Gaia> adiabatic: *doubt*
[00:04:05] <kuudes> ie qaly loss of acute covid is about same size as from long covid
[00:04:17] <adiabatic> Obormot\Gaia: Maybe a nasty case of the flu, which I rarely ever got anyway
[00:04:45] <adiabatic> and a nasty case of the flu is no picnic, but most people get better and don't have any long-term problems
[00:04:50] <kuudes> in most cases, sure; still nude covid is 20x influenza in mortality, and uk seems to have before omicron got about 1/16 covid death pace compared to before 2020 general mortality
[00:04:56] <kuudes> ie after vaccinations and the Rip
[00:05:02] <kuudes> some 100 persons per day
[00:05:06] <adiabatic> Obormot\Gaia: out of everyone I know who's gotten COVID, though, you're the only one with long-COVID problems
[00:05:07] <spxtr> With the flu I had a fever at 103, which is waaaay worse than the 100 I had 2 days ago.
[00:05:11] <saturn2> but then there's that other study that said long covid wasn't correlated with actually having covid
[00:05:38] <Betawolf> long covid is just ME but people notice it
[00:05:41] <kuudes> saturn2, sure; hard to know. the long covid group apparently reviewed something like 4000 studies out of 10000
[00:05:47] <adiabatic> Betawolf: ME?
[00:05:53] <phill> long covid scares me
[00:06:02] <phill> as someone who values their brain
[00:06:05] <kuudes> influenza kills something between 1/500 to 1/50 of general mortality in finland
[00:06:21] <kuudes> covid in uk seems to be about 1/16 after summer vaccinations
[00:06:33] <Betawolf> myalgic encephalomyelitis
[00:06:38] <kuudes> so it still seems to be something like 3x to 30x worse than flu
[00:06:39] <Betawolf> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome
[00:06:42] <Robomot> Chronic fatigue syndrome - Wikipedia (Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and ME/CFS, is a complex, fatiguing, long-term medical condition diagnosed by required primary symptoms and criteria, and often involves a broad range of symptoms. Distinguishing core symptoms are lengthy exacerbations or "flares" of the illness after ordinary minor physical or mental activity, known …)
[00:06:58] <kuudes> Betawolf, to large extent, possibly
[00:07:16] <kuudes> and cfs could largely come from Long Influenza or CMV etc
[00:07:55] <kuudes> which is why I am currently for getting something like 5x influenza vaccines compared to current and pushing people to take as many of them as you can, possibly also 2 doses per person
[00:08:04] <adiabatic> Betawolf: I occasionally hear "long COVID is just malingering women" but then I mention Obormot\Gaia who's a guy, would fit in our friend group just well, and has anosmia which people can't bullshit themselves into like other possibly-psychosomatic problems
[00:08:07] <kuudes> vaccines are quite cheap
[00:08:08] <spxtr> I guess something that also bothers me about covid reporting is that vaccinated results are often combined with unvaccinated. As all of the people I interact with are vaccinated, for my life decisions I don't care about unvaccinated statistics. (not that I don't care about their lives)
[00:08:32] <kuudes> spxtr, sure
[00:08:49] <adiabatic> I think the unvaccinated are something like 13% of the population but over half of all hospital admissions for COVID
[00:08:56] <kuudes> re delta I was prepared to open up after my kids got vaccines (they still have not got their second doses)
[00:09:01] <Betawolf> adiabatic: I'm saying it's just the same as other post-viral fatigue issues but we're noticing it because it's COVID and everyone's obsessed with it.
[00:09:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Everyone I know is vaccinated, so that distinction is totally irrelevant to anything I said or any choices I make
[00:09:07] <kuudes> adiabatic, more. us vaccination rate is not very high
[00:09:40] <phill> (there is *some* impact the unvaccinated should have on your decisions, specifically if you have to go to a hospital)
[00:09:40] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: that was not really related to what we were discussing previously, sorry.
[00:09:59] <saturn2> adiabatic: i see what you did there
[00:10:02] <spxtr> phill: that's true
[00:10:08] <adiabatic> saturn2: I'm glad someone did
[00:10:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> oh no, now I also see what adiabatic did
[00:10:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> >:(
[00:10:34] <kuudes> 74% of usa have got at least 1 dose, 62% full course

Population estimates for per-capita metrics are based on the United Nations World Population Prospects. Income groups are based on the World Bank classification. A full list of our country-specific sources is available …)
[00:10:45] <adiabatic> saturn2: so if you're wondering why the megaphone wants people vaccinated…or have friends who are wondering why the megaphone is saying what it is…
[00:11:36] <adiabatic> but I'd like to publicly thank kuudes for providing us with better numbers
[00:11:42] <superz> ^
[00:12:14] <kuudes> with omicron, 2 doses protects from hospitalizations by factor of about 1/3, so for each 3 unvaccinated patients 1 vaccinated comparable patient
[00:13:12] <kuudes> so 62%*1/3+(1-74%) = 21%+26% = 47% of patients plus some amount of 1dosers
[00:13:41] <spxtr> Similar to vaccinated vs unvaccinated, I am not "at risk", so most of the hospitalization numbers don't apply to me.
[00:13:51] <spxtr> It's often hard to dig in and find the numbers that do apply to me.
[00:13:57] <kuudes> 51% to 59% of patients depending on the protection level of 1 dose
[00:14:24] <kuudes> but in any case, patients are only reduced by factor of about 1/2
[00:14:34] <phill> i wonder if we'll start to see some viral recombination from delta/omicron coinfections
[00:14:48] <kuudes> so when everyone gets ill, it is the same as in before half of everyone would have got ill; likely no healthcare system can manage
[00:15:07] <kuudes> omicron in itself will return in about next august
[00:15:19] <kuudes> omicron gives immunity against omicron for about 6-10 months
[00:15:37] <adiabatic> how do we know this when omicron isn't 6 months old yet
[00:15:51] <adiabatic> it's only been out of the gauteng lab for what, a month?
[00:16:21] <kuudes> count of antibody halflifes etc
[00:16:46] <kuudes> which is also where one can predict maybe what sort of antibody level one would need to avoid infection, what to avoid hospitalization and what to avoid death
[00:16:53] <kuudes> basicly it is sort of ELO
[00:17:10] <kuudes> your antibody exponent gives you elo and omicron's antibody evasion gives it an elo
[00:17:12] <phill> (circulating antibodies aren't a great measure of immunity, but it's the best we have)
[00:17:15] <kuudes> then you guys play a game
[00:17:46] <kuudes> yeah, there is still t-cell etc protection, which makes the later consequences harder, ie you get rerolls for hospitalization and death
[00:18:07] <kuudes> t-cells don't get to work as fast that they would affect stuff much in your nose, ie infection and you infecting others
[00:18:16] <kuudes> I have understood, I am not sure
[00:18:29] <phill> also neutralizing antibodies
[00:18:31] <quanticle> ggreer: I'm less concerned about the price than I am about the possibility of Elon declaring that FSD is done because he's bored having it in beta rather than because it's actually anywhere close to full self-driving.
[00:18:38] <kuudes> but this is why it seems to me a nobrainer to just vax people with more doses
[00:18:40] <phill> but we also can't really test well for those in humans
[00:18:55] <kuudes> well, yes, its costly
[00:19:16] <kuudes> you can take blood out of a person and put covid in the blood and see if covid survives or not, or something
[00:19:33] <kuudes> bsl3 thingies are expensive
[00:19:35] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:19:42] <kuudes> and they should be more expensive, as we have now learned

[01:47:49] <gwern> quanticle: bidirectional means you can put in the image tokens or image+text, and make it spit out more text, so at least in theory, you can do most CLIP tricks with it as well
[01:48:30] <gwern> ie it's a sequence model trained to generate the next token, whether that be 'ABCDEF|1234523' or '12132423|ABCD...'
[01:49:44] <gwern> so you could stick in '$IMAGE_TOKENS|artstation royalty-free a photo of a charcoal sketch of a cat' and do gradient ascent on $IMAGE_TOKENS to make it more likely to emit '|artstation royalty-free a photo of a charcoal sketch of a cat', to turn the seed image into a charcoal cat
[01:49:59] <gwern> or vice-versa
[01:50:37] <gwern> also in theory, because this is much more direct supervision than mere contrastive learning, it should perform better at smaller _n_ than CLIP's 450m

[02:50:26] <kuudes> yes
[02:50:31] <kuudes> or 3

[02:57:52] <quanticle> Yeah, but like you said earlier, what makes FSD so unsettling is that its corner cases are so different from that of human drivers. I can usually tell when a human driver is about to do something dumb. I can't tell when a FSD Tesla is about to do something dumb.
[02:57:54] <ggreer> And there’s a raised median so they can’t u-turn
[02:58:07] <spxtr> ggreer: sounds like a poorly-designed intersection
[02:58:38] <spxtr> I feel like a jerk sometimes driving in unfamiliar cities because I have to go pretty slow to not miss things like one-way signs
[02:58:56] <ggreer> Yeah there are lots of them. Notice how we blame the road design when human screw up but blame the software when the computer screws up

[02:59:50] <Robomot> Cyprus reportedly discovers a Covid variant that combines omicron and delta (The strain is being called "deltacron.")
[03:00:50] <saturn2> phill: good call
[03:01:43] <kuudes> hasn't there been a couple of those before?
[03:01:51] <kuudes> but so far they have not went far
[03:02:26] <kuudes> oh, kiboneu, re "are there any omicron-targeting booster shots available anyway?"
[03:02:32] <phill> Hopefully it can't outcompete omicron
[03:02:36] <kuudes> "Dear wish fairy / catperson, after BTC: 3EyWrDHZbTRmCWPJ8cRnMm7ciadrEqqNVf and ETH: 0x3f774256f20fb934e472a7fdac045f9fd984a106 total at least 1.2 btc in worth, it is hoped that within 30 days a substance that might or might not work as a booster dose against covid omicron can be started to be shipped to some willing aspiring rationalists. No guarantees for anything or for any purpose given."
[03:02:52] <kiboneu> kuudes: reading this atm https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045329/Vaccine_surveillance_report_week_1_2022.pdf

[03:03:54] <quanticle> "I mean, I understand all about sextants even though nobody uses them anymore."
[03:03:56] <quanticle> That's a terrible comparison. The reason stick shifts and dial telephones come up so often with regards to "kids these days" is that, in order to be a reasonably functional member of society, you had to know how to use one. Just seeing one on TV didn't count. Sextants don't work in this analogy because they were always specialized equipment for a very specific profession: navigators on ships.
[03:03:58] <quanticle> Even during the era when sextants represented state-of-the-art navigational technology, the vast majority of people were ignorant of how to use one to navigate.
[03:04:05] <kiboneu> 18:29 <Darkarnium> > "Vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant"
[03:04:07] <kiboneu> 18:29 <Darkarnium> > "Among those who had received 2 doses of AstraZeneca, there was no effect against Omicron from 20 weeks after the second dose."
[03:04:09] <kiboneu> 18:29 <Darkarnium> > "Among those who had received 2 doses of Pfizer or Moderna effectiveness dropped from around 65-70% down to around 10% by 20 weeks after the 2nd dose."
[03:04:11] <kiboneu> 18:29 <Darkarnium> > "2 to 4 weeks after a booster dose vaccine effectiveness ranged from around 65 to 75%, dropping to 55 to 70% at 5 to 9 weeks and 40-50% from 10+ weeks after the booster."
[03:04:31] <kiboneu> oh sorry
[03:04:38] <kiboneu> wrong buffer
[03:06:38] <kuudes> ah, uk has not yet approved vaccines for under 12?
[03:08:11] <kuudes> do people subscribe comics these days?
[03:08:16] <kuudes> re old things
[03:08:26] <quanticle> In any case, I think that fax machines are a good candidate for Drum's challenge. Another example is having to give change at tollbooths. Most places have phased out the tollbooths where you have to drop change and have license-plate readers that send you a bill automatically (if you don't have the RFID pass). Third thing: having to look up reference information in a card catalog rather than a
[03:08:28] <quanticle> computer terminal. Computerized library catalogs are now old enough that even "nostalgic" media doesn't really mention old-school card catalogs very often.
[03:09:02] <ardent[m]> I've heard of card catalogs but never used one
[03:09:22] <spxtr> I had to use microfiche a few months ago for actual research.
[03:09:24] <ardent[m]> (born in 1993, got my library card at age 5 or 6)
[03:10:11] <gwern> yeah, libraries had generally phased out card catalogues by that point. at my library, if you had been maybe 5 years older, you would've used them *briefly* before they finally shrugged and scrapped them
[03:10:21] <ardent[m]> mostly heard of them from school textbooks written in the 80s-90s as something older libraries might still have
[03:11:50] <Betawolf> I think my library had one when I was young, though it was small enough you didn't really need to know how to use it.
[03:16:04] <saturn2> i remember when they replaced the wyse terminals with windows PCs running internet explorer
[03:16:26] <quanticle> Oh, microfiche is a good one! I remember, back in the day, seeing row upon row of microfiche readers at the library. They're all gone now, and barely anyone comments on their absence.
[03:16:59] <spxtr> I think most libraries have scanned all their fish, no need for the readers anymore.
[03:18:07] <quanticle> Yeah, all that content has been scanned and stored as PDF now. What did you have to use the actual microfiche for?
[03:19:12] <gwern> they definitely haven't
[03:19:27] <spxtr> I was trying to find some old magazine article in the engineering library at UW, wasn't in fish yet
[03:19:29] <gwern> (you think I'm paying $40/thesis to Proquest and waiting a few weeks because it's all already scanned?)
[03:19:35] <spxtr> also this was years ago, time is warped for me
[03:20:08] <ardent[m]> yeah a lot of stuff is still only on microfilm
[03:20:31] <ardent[m]> mostly old newspapers
[03:21:22] <spxtr> https://www.lib.washington.edu/engineering/about they say 11,795 microfilm reels, 3 million fish
[03:21:22] <Robomot> About the Engineering Library — UW Libraries
[03:21:40] <quanticle> Another candidate: film cameras. I was looking on eBay, mostly out of curiosity, and film SLRs are now _incredibly cheap_. Like you can get cameras that sold new for north of $500 for less than $50.
[03:21:46] <saturn2> in matrix 4 when they showed neo's room with apple 2 floppy drives connected to neo's 1999 PC i wondered whether it was an intentional joke or just zoomer set designers
[03:23:00] <quanticle> I considered buying one, on impulse, but then I realized, that I have no idea where one goes to have photographic film developed these days.
[03:24:08] <saturn2> quanticle: oddly enough, walgreens still does it
[03:24:53] <spxtr> I used to do it at costco but it looks like they stopped
[03:26:05] <kuudes> polaroid cameras seem nice but their film paper is quite expensive
[03:26:41] <quanticle> Huh, do they? Maybe I should buy that Canon, then.

[04:54:49] <feepbot> than we already are. So what does this SSP 2 world feel like? It depends, O’Neill told me, on who you are. One thing he wants to make very clear is that all the paths, even the hottest ones, show improvements in human well-being on average. IPCC scientists expect that average life expectancy will continue to rise, that poverty and hunger rates will continue to decline, and that
[04:54:49] <feepbot> average incomes will go up in every single plausible future, simply because they always have. “There isn’t, you know, like a Mad Max scenario among the SSPs,” O’Neill said. Climate change will ruin individual lives and kill individual people, and it may even drag down rates of improvement in human well-being, but on average, he said, “we’re generally in the

[05:45:16] <spxtr> vitalik's reply
[05:48:17] <saturn2> this does not inspire confidence
[05:50:07] <saturn2> i had wondered why everything in the ethereum world was so opaque about how it actually works, now i know it's because the whole thing was a fake facade
[05:50:07] <spxtr> one of my former-seattle ea-adjacent friends is trying to convince me that web3 is the future and I should try to make hella $$ with web3 stuff and donate it to charity
[05:50:42] <saturn2> i'm sure you can make hella $$ with it
[05:51:35] <saturn2> as long as you have a flexible attitude towards telling the truth
[05:51:45] <spxtr> I see it as similar to working for a hedge fund to fund charity. you're moving play-money around to make rich people richer and the world gets slightly worse each time, but you make so much money to donate to charity that it's okay in the end
[05:52:30] <feep> honestly this comment at least inspires confidence in me, more so than not
[05:52:52] <gwern> the Ev is definitely high
[05:53:39] <gwern> it's worth noting that the majority of all EA funds ever donated/pledged are going to be from creating a crypto exchange when everyone thought that was too late to do so
[05:54:00] <spxtr> you mean sam bankman fried's thing?
[05:54:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I... I don't get it. what is the impact of one more crypto exchange over others? why would people use it over established exchanges?
[05:55:32] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps by "crypto exchange" you mean "some entity that benefits from facilitating crypo transactions", which then makes sense, since OpenSea is a really viable business
[05:56:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I think we need more EA-adj people in crypto/web3 to be honest - their distaste for the domain gets in the way of actually helping humanity (according to their own philosophical principles)
[05:57:38] <PlanckWalk> I think we need more EA-adj people in selling used cars for the same reason.
[05:57:39] <saturn2> i don't know how much turning the whole world into lagos is helping humanity
[05:57:40] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: oh, the existing exchanges were just lazy and incompetent
[05:58:03] <PlanckWalk> Orliteral snake oil
[05:58:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I am fine with EA-adj people selling literal snake oil as long as they donate 50+% to charity
[05:58:39] <kuudes> beware the skulls
[05:58:46] <gwern> as a poweruser customer, he got angry at how they externalized their incompetence in running contracts onto the customers, and decided to make his own exchange, having enough wall street experience to realize how fat the margins were and how incompetent the existing exchanges were

[06:15:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, reading the web3 thing
[06:15:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the whole I probably will agree with Moxie at the end, but:
[06:16:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "People are still trying to standardize sharing a video reliably over IRC; meanwhile, Slack lets you create custom reaction emoji based on your face." ... but this is to IRC's credit, not Slack's!
[06:17:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't want custom reaction emojis based on my face in my chat!
[06:17:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or any emojis! At all!
[06:17:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If something is truly decentralized, it becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time. That is a problem for technology, because the rest of the ecosystem is moving very quickly, and if you don’t keep up you will fail." ... what "you"? Who will fail? All those IRC startups? That's who's gonna fail?
[06:18:04] <saturn2> ethereum doesn't create any new wealth, it only redistributes existing wealth upwards. so EAs are creating more new charity cases the more they earn to give
[06:18:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There are entire parallel industries focused on defining and improving methodologies like Agile to try to figure out how to organize enormous groups of people so that they can _move as quickly as possible_ because it is so critical." ... but Agile is bad and "move fast break things" is also bad
[06:19:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "visualizing this financial structure would resemble something similar to a pyramid shape" ... rofl
[06:20:47] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: IRC has failed to become a mainstream chat system
[06:24:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> In order for IRC to become a mainstream chat system, either 99% of humanity would have to suddenly transform into computer nerds, or IRC would have to transform into Slack or Discord
[06:24:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> The former is impossible and the latter is undesirable
[06:24:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> So there's no outcome where (a) IRC becomes a mainstream chat system and (b) this is a good thing in any way
[06:25:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> In that light, to say that IRC has "failed" to do this is, at least, a weird way of putting it
[06:27:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Except maybe in a broader sense like "the kind of computer systems used by nerds have [predictably] failed to become accepted by the bulk of all people" ... I mean, IRC wasn't designed for the world where a substantial fraction of humanity has internet access and basically lives online all the time
[06:27:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's not a fault of IRC!
[06:27:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Note, I don't mean that just in the banal sense of "they didn't know what was coming so we can't blame them for not predicting the future and making Slack right from the get-go"
[06:28:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean that, even retroactively (hell, *especially* retroactively), this is not a fault, but a positive quality
[06:28:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> The world where everyone is online all the time (instead of the internet mostly being for nerds) is, actually, worse
[06:29:08] <kuudes> nato uses irc, does that count?
[06:29:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha, maybe
[06:30:03] <phill> Discord is basically irc for regular people
[06:30:17] <gwern> ordinary people don't care if nato uses irc, only naruto
[06:31:46] <phill> (It is kind of ironic for all the decentralization of web3, discord seems to be the preferred chat system of choice when you have a more decentralized option)
[06:32:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> phill: That's true in a certain sense, but that sense is one where "IRC for regular people" isn't actually anything like IRC anymore
[06:37:51] <gwern> the problem for defi and web3 is that if they are only as successful as IRC, they can't support their valuations and will collapse, which for many of them will trigger a death spiral sending them to 0
[06:41:33] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: we could imagine a world where IRC is the same as it is now, but another equally decentralized protocol became what discord is - but that's impossible for the reasons moxie points out

[14:50:40] <nshepperd2> kuudes: good
[14:50:54] <nshepperd2> sounds like hell being stuck there
[14:52:11] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: okay so what happens with my code is that my dataloader takes 88 minutes to create prompts + continuations from one file of samples, and then every step it pops the amount required per batch / step
[14:52:40] <nshepperd2> that sounds very inefficient
[14:52:46] <PapuaHardyNet> so the time taken for steps is asymptotic (88 minutes for first step, and then less than a second for other steps, on an i3 3rd gen, things should be faster on a TPU)
[14:53:33] <PapuaHardyNet> should I do a just-in-time creation of the amount of prompts and continuations that is necessary for each step as the step occurs?
[14:53:54] <PapuaHardyNet> this means I sacrifice the ability to speed this up using JIT-ing, at least based on my code
[14:54:11] <nshepperd2> well firstly
[14:54:29] <nshepperd2> if anything you are doing involves varying array sizes, do it in pytorch, not jax
[14:54:56] <PapuaHardyNet> i should use both pytorch and jax? really?
[14:55:00] <PapuaHardyNet> but please go on
[14:55:10] <nshepperd2> like use pytorch for data loading stuff
[14:55:35] <nshepperd2> do the padding and stuff
[14:56:04] <nshepperd2> and then when you have a batch of uniform sized arrays of tokens or w/e
[14:56:10] <nshepperd2> then convert it to jax
[14:57:03] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, and what's secondly?
[14:57:19] <nshepperd2> i don't remember
[14:57:25] <PapuaHardyNet> aww.
[14:57:47] <PapuaHardyNet> well, why pytorch? is jax slower than pytorch for any one-off operation?
[14:57:59] <nshepperd2> jax hates varying sizes of arrays
[14:58:28] <nshepperd2> like it will recompile stuff for every single array shape it sees
[14:58:32] <nshepperd2> which is horribly slow
[14:58:43] <PapuaHardyNet> even if you disable JIT?
[14:59:15] <PapuaHardyNet> (I mean, yes, I did see that even after disabling JIT there's always "compiling" messages in the log files but I'm curious what you know about this)
[14:59:17] <nshepperd2> probably
[14:59:35] <nshepperd2> i mean it will still go through XLA or whatever
[14:59:45] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. why not numpy?
[15:00:12] <PapuaHardyNet> well yeah, numpy does it all on CPU only, and using pytorch you leverage GPU and TPU if possible
[15:00:31] <nshepperd2> numpy is fine
[15:01:15] <nshepperd2> for data loading stuff you generally don't want to use GPU or TPU bc it will conflict with jax's memory management of those
[15:01:26] <nshepperd2> so you'd be using pytorch on cpu
[15:01:43] <nshepperd2> i just mildly prefer pytorch's api to numpy's
[15:02:41] <PapuaHardyNet> great! I'll try numpy then. Honestly, I'll still try to stick with jax (I stopped padding and now am using fixed size without padding), so if there's still ridiculous amounts of delay, then I'll go with numpy, and if that doesn't work out then pytorch
[15:03:37] <PapuaHardyNet> what do you think of the just-in-time data loading? what I do right now is take a file, take out all the text samples, join it as one long string, convert it into a tokenized array, and then break it down into a a long list of prompt + continuation pairs
[15:03:52] <nshepperd2> oh the other good reason to use pytorch/numpy instead of jax is you can then use pytorch's worker processes for data loading
[15:04:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I could instead just break it down `batch_size` times to get a "just in time" style manufacturing of batches to send every step
[15:04:26] <PapuaHardyNet> so every step takes about 2 seconds instead of 88 minutes then 1 second each step
[15:04:32] <nshepperd2> so that you can load stuff in the background while your training is running
[15:04:45] <nshepperd2> which is the usual way people do it
[15:04:57] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, that sounds good, I'll have to take a look at this
[15:05:58] <PapuaHardyNet> so basically you are saying go with pytorch worker process that uses multi-processing so that you can load this in the background. hmm

[22:56:58] <kuudes> hi Filipepe!
[22:57:03] <kuudes> how are you?
[22:57:16] <two2thehead> My prior was that autistic women were more likely to have sex than autistic men. I also assumed it held for higher 'levels' of autism, ceteris paribus
[22:57:21] <Filipepe> persevering
[22:57:27] <kuudes> always!
[22:57:33] <two2thehead> But apparently this doesn't hold for general IQ proxy
[23:00:31] <two2thehead> "After controlling for biological sex, age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, individuals in the lowest cognitive ability group had significantly lower odds of experiencing each type of sex than those in the average ability group. Although individuals in the highest cognitive ability group had significantly lower odds of experiencing vaginal intercourse than those in the average ability group, this association did not remain significant when 
[23:00:32] <two2thehead> analyses were stratified by biological sex. These differences in experiences have implications for future health and warrant further study to understand policy implications for sexual health services and education."
[23:01:24] <two2thehead> So using a very naive naive bayes approach, there could be a market of horny low IQ people. If you are also horny, this seems like an untapped market :V

[23:27:56] <kuudes> two2thehead, in usa ventilation numbers are rising together with cases; maybe a bit slower or later

[23:28:15] <two2thehead> no I meant wrt saliva being used for boosters
[23:28:40] <kuudes> galambo, is it so that you guys still have capacity for ventilation? I mean in past there was something like double the current ventilation patients there
[23:29:24] <kuudes> two2thehead, covid stays alive while frozen. so pondering on taking saliva from self when infected and freezing that, and then maybe 2-4 months after recovery, insert frozen saliva to nose
[23:29:40] <kuudes> to get reinfected with thing you already have immune response for
[23:29:42] <two2thehead> naruhodo
[23:29:53] <kuudes> to make that immune response better; same as with boosters
[23:29:55] <two2thehead> so to keep your antibody levels high, over time
[23:29:58] <kuudes> yes
[23:30:00] <two2thehead> gotcha kuudes +1
[23:30:08] <kuudes> I mean, if you can get a vaccine that would be better
[23:30:25] <kuudes> but it seems to me they will continue to be unreasonably stingy over here, so this could be a backup option
[23:30:38] <kuudes> and well, makes the virus pay rent at least
[23:30:51] <kuudes> if it appropriates my cells as bioreactors, might as well store part of the produce
[23:31:07] <galambo> kuudes, I havent covered admissions for a while. but last time I did it seemed ok
[23:32:02] * two2thehead saves that in onenote
[23:32:10] <kuudes> admissions have risen but they could be coincidental; same with deaths
[23:32:19] <kuudes> but ventilation use would seem likely to be noncoincidental
[23:32:28] <kuudes> but it has not yet appeared on https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare

[23:33:15] <two2thehead> I wonder what my NSA agent thinks about all this?
[23:33:52] <kuudes> hiiii!
[23:34:46] <two2thehead> kek
[23:37:51] <kuudes> but if one does do such, I would recommend something like; 1. drool in a mug. 2. take a minigrip (small closable plastic bag, 1 dl), put the contents of the mug in the bag. 3. close the bag and wipe it with napkin 4. wash hands 5. put the bag upside down into another bag and close the second bag 6. wipe the second bag with a napkin 7. wash hands 8. put the second bag into third bag. 9. wipe with napkin 10. wash hands. 11 label the third bag "covid-19 
[23:37:51] <kuudes> BIOHAZARD! YYYY-mm-DD Name saliva sample" 12 put the third bag inside freezer, preferrably in the back
[23:39:05] <kuudes> then if you want to depose of it later, burn it in a fireplace or if such is unavailable, take it out to sunlight and leave there for 1-2 days and then put it into trash unopened
[23:39:14] <kuudes> this is not medical advice.

[23:52:55] <kuudes> so the practice was that you go to hear insults, and then later insult someone else to learn the comeback
[23:55:09] <catern> kuudes: hm yes interesting analogy
[23:55:17] <two2thehead> kuudes, monkey island is a good example
[23:55:27] <two2thehead> yeah you read my mind re sword fighting

[23:58:37] <kuudes> galambo, that 3 dose question seems hardish to judge; the peak question is ok to judge
[23:58:38] <catern> multiple levels of NPC speak, you speak, but just where you're only allowed to say things you've heard before
