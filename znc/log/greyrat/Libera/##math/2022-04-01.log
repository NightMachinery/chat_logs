[01:25:29] <Franciman> indeed matric space =/> normed space
[01:25:45] <[itchyjunk]> does not imply ?
[01:25:45] <Franciman> a vector space with a metric => normed space
[01:25:56] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[01:26:38] <[itchyjunk]> Is there a vector space that can't be turned into some obvious metric space?
[01:27:21] <Franciman> every R-vector space is isomorphic to R^n

[01:27:38] <Franciman> in that case you have an obvious metric induced by R^n
[01:27:58] <Franciman> i don't know about infinite dimensional vector spaces, though
[01:29:03] <Franciman> ah you can use the discrete norm
[01:29:25] <Franciman> d(x, y) = 1 if x = y, 0, otherwise
[01:29:57] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[01:31:11] <Franciman> I'm not able to show an example of a metric space that can't be turned into a normed vector space
[01:31:17] <Franciman> though
[01:32:36] <Franciman> [itchyjunk]: is a normed vector space a real vector space for you?
[01:32:41] <Franciman> real or at most complex
[01:33:37] <Franciman> i can show an example. Take the finite set of the letters of the english alphabet {A, B, C, D,...}
[01:33:46] <Franciman> as a metric use the discrete metric
[01:34:27] <Franciman> if you could turn it into a real vector space
[01:34:47] <Fangs> Franciman: take a graph
[01:34:56] <Franciman> imagine it has dimension 0, then it should be isomorphic to the set {0}, but we have more than one letter in the alphabet
[01:35:04] <Fangs> X = set of points, metric = length between two vertices
[01:35:13] <Franciman> so if it has finite dimension, it is isomorphic to R^n, but R^n is an infinite set, so impossible
[01:35:23] <Franciman> if it has infintie dimension, it must have infinite size, so impossible
[01:36:04] <Franciman> so {A, B, .... } is a metric space with the discrete norm, or as Fangs considering it as a graph with the order induced by the order of the alphabet
[01:36:07] <Franciman> nice Fangs
[01:36:25] <Franciman> but it can't be a real vector space (or complex, same proof really, it should be infinite)

[01:37:12] <Fangs> yyou can also take subsets of R^n that are geometric objects
[01:37:21] <Franciman> Fangs: so the discrete metric is a special case of the graph example! neat
[01:38:04] <Fangs> vector spaces has to be 'flat' in some sense, if you take the sphere or the torus, theres not really any obvious way to turn it into a vector space
[01:38:34] <Fangs> but the metric in R^n induces a metric in said subspace
[01:39:07] <Franciman> Fangs: uhm isn't the sphere a lie group?
[01:39:12] <Fangs> Franciman: idk if its a discrete metric. if you take the graph A- B - C, then d(A,C) = 2
[01:39:23] <Fangs> Franciman: a lie group is not a vector space
[01:39:28] <Franciman> oh oh ofc
[01:39:30] <Fangs> it has a lie algebra, which is a vector space
[01:39:31] <Franciman> sorry

[07:37:42] <blahboybaz> When we have numbers to the right of a decimal we call that the "decimal place" but what do you call it when you want to refer to the place of the number when it is on the left of the decimal (ie: whole numbers)?
[07:38:18] <blahboybaz> I'm trying to label something using the term and it seems unclear way to say it if I just say "place" or "number place"
[07:39:04] <somiaj> tenths, hundereths, thousandths, millionths, ten-millionths, etc
[07:39:13] <somiaj> the places represnt 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, etc

[07:41:09] <blahboybaz> I need a more generally descriptive term
[07:41:21] <blahboybaz> magnitude?
[07:41:34] <somiaj> For integers we just call it the number of digits, a 12 digit number referes to a number that has 12 digits and the first digit is assumed to be non-zero

[07:42:05] <somiaj> magnitude is kinda a generic term that can refer to this, can also refer to the first non-zero number on the right of the decimial place too
[07:42:48] <somiaj> magnitude is a measure of how big a number is, sometimes when comparing numbers like millions and billions, billions has a bigger magnitude. There are also cases where people round to the nearest 10^(power) to express the magnitude of the number.
[07:43:05] <blahboybaz> Well my diagram is related to an algorithm and what I need to define is that the place of the number is changing as you descend the diagram

[08:52:00] <isekaijin> It's still the same theorem.
[08:53:06] <isekaijin> Applying the Fourier transform twice is just time reversal.
[08:54:19] <isekaijin> Of course, the product of two time-reversed functions is equal to the time reversal of the product of the original functions.
[08:54:23] <isekaijin> Ditto the convolution.
[08:56:12] *** Joins: kado (~weechat@user/kado)
[08:56:23] <isekaijin> Actually, if you think of time reversal as “rotating the time axis 180 degrees”, then the Fourier transform is kinda “rotating the time axis 90 degrees”. (Of course, this doesn't make sense in a literal way, because what the heck is “rotating the time axis 90 degrees”? It's one-dimensional!)
[08:57:20] <tusko> Ok so I've got e^(-1+2i)t * u(t) and I want the Fourier transform. I know this is the convolution of the transforms of those functions F{e^(-1+2i)t} = 2pi * d(w-2) and F{u(t)} = pi*d(w) + 2/jw. d is the Dirac delta function.
[08:57:54] <tusko> But can I just convolve those two things plainly? Am I overthinking this?
[09:00:00] <isekaijin> If I recall correctly, the convolution theorem assumes that you are convolving actual functions, which the Dirac delta “function” is not.
[09:00:08] <isekaijin> But it's not like I have this stuff super fresh in my mind.
[09:00:54] <tusko> Well the original function is e^(-1+2i)t * u(t), the convolution is of the transform wich invokes deltas
[09:01:16] <tusko> deltas should just be the value of the other function evalutated at the point or somethign like that

[12:52:00] <greenbagels> or are you saying there's a 4th parameter with respect to which V is nonconstant

[12:56:23] <DnzAtWrk> I could do p := p + v(p.x, p.y, p.z) * timestep iteratively
[12:56:50] <DnzAtWrk> but I suspect the answer would be wrong as it would always be undershooting curves
[12:56:52] <DnzAtWrk> I think
[12:57:19] <greenbagels> well by defining v(x,y,z) you're basically saying that is a particle's velocity if it is at that position at any given time, right
[12:57:50] <greenbagels> so i think you can turn this into an initial value problem?

[13:03:41] <DnzAtWrk> hmm
[13:04:20] <greenbagels> well, for each step
[13:04:37] <DnzAtWrk> I need to create these wind rays through a velocity field, something akin to CFD, so I do need to store all the positions along the path
[13:04:42] <greenbagels> overall it would be like O(dt)
[13:05:26] <DnzAtWrk> for some reason I thought that using steps like that would have an inherit bias
[13:05:40] <DnzAtWrk> like the ray would be moving straighter than they should
[13:06:19] <greenbagels> hmm i dont think the bias is like strictly larger or smaller, in the general case
[13:06:42] <greenbagels> like if your velocity field oscillates wildly it will probably be neither or something

[13:16:51] <greenbagels> and depending on whether you're familiar with a programming language, it should be fairly easy to find one that works out of hte box

[15:39:34] <Emori> greenbagels Yea but wouldn't the region bounded by y=cos(x) cover the point (0.1, 0.1) anyways?
[15:39:56] <greenbagels> Emori: presumably they only want the first subregion that includes that point
[15:40:34] <Emori> greenbagels So as you said then, y >= 0?

[15:41:29] <lericson> lol, RK4 is pretty much public domain at this point
[15:41:59] <greenbagels> i would interpret it to mean that first half-wave (really a quarter-wave)
[15:43:36] <Emori> greenbagels Otherwise it wouldn't make sense to say that the region is bounded by an axis right, if that wasn't the case?
[15:44:38] <greenbagels> Emori: well the axes give you that its in quadrant 1; i think the (0.1, 0.1) is to emphasize they dont want the entire quadrant, just that first bit touching the origin

[15:57:05] <greenbagels> my point is i think they want you to do the integral for hte purple region
[15:57:07] <greenbagels> not the red region
[15:57:49] <greenbagels> it turns out that these integrals would be the same but it would just add technical difficulty for no reason
[15:58:47] <Emori> greenbagels How did you reason about that? I understand the first part you posted about the red region, but what about the purple. Also, I don't follow when you say "it turns out that these integrals would be the same but it would just add technical difficulty for no reason" what do you mean?
[15:59:15] <greenbagels> the purple is just this "initial portion" of the red
[15:59:41] <greenbagels> when they say "including the point (0.1, 0.1)" i interpret it to mean "just the small bounded region that includes this point"
[15:59:57] <Emori> Alright, but how did you get the upper bound for x?
[16:00:18] <greenbagels> its the x value where y=cos(x) hits the axis y=0
[16:00:28] <greenbagels> aka wherever cos(x)=0
[16:00:46] <greenbagels> the first positive value where cos(x)=0*
[16:01:33] <greenbagels> and as to the second thing i said, i think it would be best if i just leave this idea to simmer in your head
[16:01:56] <greenbagels> you can play around with the problem after you solve it if you are curious, it comes down to 2pi-periodicity of sine and cosine
[16:02:57] <Emori> greenbagels I will play with it. But should it be a strict < you think or <= and >= ?

[20:26:20] <cadmio> so now that I've established it's irreducible how do I proceed to find the splitting field?
[20:26:24] <somiaj> how if you use y fist, y goes from the bottom curve sqrt(x) to the top curve 1, and then x goes from 0 to 1.
[20:26:33] <somiaj> So now swithc this, do x first, what are the two curves x goes between.

[20:36:40] <Z-module> You have to train yourself to do more rapid arithmetic, when numbers are modest.
[20:36:43] <Emori> somiaj I mean, isn't the correct way to describe the region as D = {(x, y) : 0 <= x <= 1, 1 <= y <= sqrt(x)} ?
[20:36:46] <somiaj> wakeup: the 'infinty' upperbound means limit, I just gave you the definition of what it means to have infinity as an upper bound on a limit.
[20:37:02] <wakeup> yes, I understand your definition

[20:37:08] <wakeup> you didn't understand my point
[20:37:09] <somiaj> Emori: There are multiple ways to describe this, you can also describe it as 0 <= x <= y^2 and 0 <= y <= 1
[20:37:14] <wakeup> in the stack exchange answer, there is no limit there
[20:37:31] <somiaj> wakeup: there is, whenever you have an infinity (or vertical asymptote) in a riemann integral you have a limit
[20:37:32] <wakeup> I don't see anything like "lim r to infinty int_{a}^r"

[20:40:26] <cadmio> Z-module: ok but it's not said that all the other factors are in Q, right?

[22:56:45] <Emori> There is a lemma that says: if f is uniformly continuous on a bounded set D where the boundary points of D are a null set https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_set, then f is Riemann-integrable over D. Is the "uniformly continuous" needed here because the set can be open?
[22:57:36] <Emori> Could I have restatet the lemma by saying that "f is continuous on D and D is also closed" ?
[22:58:15] <Emori> But that would then imply that f is uniformly continuous. Maybe it puts unnecessary restrictions.
