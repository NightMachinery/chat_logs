[01:33:28] <Guest3896> now windows is kinda half died?
[01:34:05] <T`aZ> i guess
[01:34:28] <T`aZ> it's definitely changing it's users target
[01:34:48] <T`aZ> its*(?)
[01:35:01] <Guest3896> even windows phone didnt work
[01:35:48] <Guest3896> it seems the bad popularity of Mr BG became in opposition of him
[01:36:22] <Guest3896> the evilness is punished some day
[01:36:50] <Guest3896> nowadays the vac things is even much worse for him
[01:36:51] <T`aZ> retarded smarphone ecosysem went viral, population changed, power users getting fedup with retarded shenanigans can only move somewhere else
[01:37:19] <Guest3896> I have read that he is going to invest now in atomic energy
[01:38:17] <T`aZ> not sure the two are related at all, im not seeing retards vaccin 5g idiots changing their os because of that
[01:39:38] <Guest3896> first, talking of money, which sustains all these things: copying windows alternatively is a big hole for him
[01:40:02] <Guest3896> and linux being free is a huge competence
[01:41:14] <Guest3896> not totally sure if legal windows got finally any system to avoid alternative copies
[01:42:14] <Guest3896> the main reasons people not changing it is: 1) confortability; 2) compatibility
[01:42:24] <Guest3896> comfortability*
[01:42:43] <Guest3896> I use both, but mainly linux
[01:42:57] <T`aZ> the moment one of the main distro starts to invest into desktop polishing, really improving the enduser experience (no, not with gnome lol), and it still requires a huge ampunt of work, then it's kinda bye bye for MS
[01:43:04] <Guest3896> or almost exclusively linux
[01:43:09] <T`aZ> even a paid distro version would do that
[01:43:39] <T`aZ> but probably not gonna happen, as the $$$ are into the server side, not desktop side
[01:44:06] <Guest3896> I am almost sure MS got to make some linux distros
[01:44:18] <Guest3896> they even bought opensuse
[01:44:23] <T`aZ> ms already has a linux distro
[01:44:41] <T`aZ> with non secure crap installed by default
[01:45:00] <T`aZ> see the azure linux images 
[01:45:23] <Guest3896> as a distro alone or into windows (which is also truth)?
[01:45:40] <T`aZ> a distro alone

[01:48:05] <Guest3896> pft what a mess :)
[01:48:38] <Guest3896> I was reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure
[01:48:55] <Guest3896> MS everytime worse :)
[01:49:29] <Guest3896> well but I dont discard some windows versions to use sometimes
[01:49:54] <Guest3896> I believe it is not wise to go to the extreme
[01:50:22] <Guest3896> and Stallman goes to it sometimes
[01:51:08] <Guest3896> the same that android: I really don't like it or cellulars, but sometimes it can be useful
[01:52:08] <T`aZ> #stallmanwasright
[01:52:13] <Guest3896> one tries to use libre soft all one can but when you see some hard obstacle you need to be flexible
[01:52:50] <T`aZ> you do not sound fascist enough to be in this chan
[01:52:53] <Guest3896> flexible without entering into... wrong decisions, of course
[01:53:08] <Guest3896> hah
[01:53:51] <Guest3896> I am not communist, no :)
[01:54:25] <Guest3896> extremes are bad, we need a wise balance
[01:54:37] <Guest3896> a moderated capitalism :)
[01:54:48] <Guest3896> you work, you earn
[01:55:35] <T`aZ> this new guy is no fun
[01:55:37] <Guest3896> the falacy "1) owners versus 2) workers" is very bad at communism/socialism
[01:55:59] <Guest3896> the owners are workers too
[01:56:21] <Guest3896> they didn't get the money magically; they worked hard
[01:56:38] <T`aZ> ha, lol
[01:56:53] <T`aZ> this, my friend, is why you'll keep working for the rest of your life
[01:57:17] <T`aZ> that dream, working hard, to have some real money and be succesful
[01:57:48] <Guest3896> we always need to work, basically
[01:58:09] <T`aZ> the amount could be largely reduced though
[01:58:25] <Guest3896> but socialism is almost a crazyness
[01:58:57] <Guest3896> if it started on atheism, which seems it was, it won't end well
[01:59:13] <T`aZ> go on
[01:59:23] <Guest3896> well, yes, there are workers' rights, etc.
[01:59:30] <jotham> i see Guest3896 is fully cooked
[01:59:36] <Guest3896> hah
[01:59:42] <jotham> do you have a developmental disability Guest3896 
[01:59:46] <Guest3896> I said: no extremes
[02:00:18] <Guest3896> apparently, at some time, employers were abusing their employees
[02:00:31] <Guest3896> nowadays too in some way
[02:00:33] <T`aZ> at some time ?
[02:00:38] <Guest3896> ha
[02:01:14] <Guest3896> but communism goes to the extreme mostly or totally
[02:01:29] <Guest3896> socialism/communism/etc
[02:01:55] <Guest3896> maybe there are things you can rescue, though
[02:02:20] <Guest3896> I guess in my country, Argentina, we have some
[02:02:32] <Guest3896> with Peron
[02:03:43] <Guest3896> and, lately, worldwide, things are going or try to be really communist-way or very wrong :|

[21:54:17] <ERROH> dukwon, it's a eu banking change going on for quite some time now
[21:54:48] <ERROH> they shuold've been informing you about for a long time too if you were subject to those laws
[21:55:58] <dukwon> only got an email on 20th feb
[21:56:11] <dukwon> and i did what they asked the same day
[21:56:53] <dukwon> (pick one of three reasons why i'm their customer, none of which really covered my actual use-case)

[22:22:48] <Guest3867> hi, tunnel fascists
[22:23:05] <Guest3867> we will conquer the world today?
[22:23:18] <Guest3867> - "YEEEAAAHHHHHHH!!!"
[22:23:48] <Guest3867> but you all need to go out from the tunnel first
[22:24:20] <Guest3867> we are not moles
[22:41:47] <dukwon> the tunnel will be patrolled and closed 3 weeks on thursday, ready to resume operations
[22:47:23] <MaNI> some of us are definitely moles, probably the other 68 who never talk
[22:57:38] <dukwon> applications to the CERN summer student programme from indians and pakistanis have dropped 40% and 90% respectively, following 3 years of about 1000 of each
[23:06:10] <dukwon> i like looking at the ones who gave the wrong answers to the screening questions about eligibility
[23:06:33] <dukwon> 11 people submitted their application despite claiming to speak neither english nor french (the languages the form was offered in)
[23:11:50] <dukwon> 10 people say they were born in the 1930s
[23:12:49] <Faux> :D
[23:20:15] <markuskj> well you should never put your real info in web forms!
[23:21:28] <TheFlash> That's what I told the police, when they accused me of tax fraud.
