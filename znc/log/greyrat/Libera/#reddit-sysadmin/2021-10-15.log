[01:05:24] <koollman> t​herottenapple: a table can have one or more indexes. it can have only one clustered index, if you think about it. That index is the one that will define the order of records in the table

[01:07:29] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> right
[01:07:41] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> so an unclustered index is reordering the columns or the rows?

[01:10:45] <koollman> (well, they may, but not in this context)
[01:12:18] <koollman> t​herottenapple: imagine you get all rows from the customers table. they come back in some order. they can't come back in multiple orders. either they will come back sorted by name then surname, or surname then name, or id , or something.

[01:32:37] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> and an unclustered index is handled by the dbms that puts pointers to the data in different ways to index in the future

[03:01:59] <Work-BWMerlin> Is it normal that you have to buy the type of printer drivers your printer will use
[03:02:19] <Work-BWMerlin> i.e. if you buy a new MFP you then have to buy the ability to print in PS or PCL?
[03:02:55] <xe0n> buy drivers?!
[03:03:04] <xe0n> ummm if anything they should be avail with your support contract
[03:03:14] <xe0n> ie like hp when you get support and access to the software library
[03:03:20] <xe0n> but otherwise, umm i wouldn't think so?
[03:03:51] <xe0n> having said that, a few years back the MFPs we used had a dodgy driver from toshiba
[03:04:03] <xe0n> so i was able to reach out to toshiba and report the bug with the driver, and they provided me a fixed driver
[03:04:07] <xe0n> found an issue on citrix servers
[03:05:05] <Work-BWMerlin> No not buy the drivers but buy the ability to use certain driver types
[03:05:15] <xe0n> maybe? may be vendor specific

[03:05:42] <Work-BWMerlin> Canon printer cannot print from the virtual airprint queue
[03:05:57] <xe0n> and you've opened a support ticket with papercut\your support vendor\canon?
[03:06:26] <Work-BWMerlin> The airprint queue is using a PCL driver but the Canon printer is only licensed to use the UFR driver type
[03:06:33] <xe0n> okay cool
[03:06:38] <xe0n> ahh airprint, i.e. iOS printing?
[03:06:53] <Work-BWMerlin> Yes, just got off a phone call with Canon who said it was normal that you had to buy the ability to print in PCL or PS
[03:07:09] <Work-BWMerlin> Mac OSX printer but same same
[03:07:09] <xe0n> okay cool so that must be it
[03:07:17] <xe0n> yep i setup airprint yearrrrss ago
[03:07:44] <xe0n> cool, so get a purchase order together, get it signed, purchase the drivert
[03:07:54] <xe0n> shouldn't be a problem if its a requirement

[03:08:12] <xe0n> its justified, should be signed without a problem

[08:15:38] <crawfs> my favourite part of being a sysadmin is everyone listens to you and acts on your advice
[08:16:49] <crawfs> yesterday some devs sent me an error they were getting where their application was having its connections forcibly closed by the remote third party when trying to connect
[08:16:50] <SpookyGibby> @kzter29, can you elaborate? You've been asking the same question all day today. I suspect you need to find some additional diagnostic information to help with whatever is the issue
[08:17:17] <crawfs> I quoted the error back at them and advised them to check with the third party if there were more verbose errors on their end
[08:18:05] <Hash> crawfs: really?
[08:18:29] <SpookyGibby> seems par for the couse, cryptic1 
[08:18:37] <SpookyGibby> s/cryptic1 crawfs 
[08:18:48] <crawfs> and of course they did none of that and buried themselves trying to troubleshoot it from our side
[08:19:21] <crawfs> I only just now after spending 2 hours on it managed to comprehensively convince them of the need to contact the third part
[08:19:46] <spiderman> bn_work: I worked as an apprentice at a place called the Open-Source Lab in college and learned how to do devops under a fucking wizard of a man, and I took those skills and networked with former employees and asked if they were hiring, they started me at $60/hr with 14 months experience at 20 years old

[08:26:42] <crawfs> xe0n, what do you mean?
[08:27:19] <spiderman> my company is maybe 40 people, its fine. Though personal politics love to shine through and its not that professional of an environment (good or bad, you decide)
[08:27:51] <xe0n> if you've got 10 people...half of them are admin
[08:27:58] <spiderman> my politics often misalign with coworkers and I often feel like I can't really develop any relationships with them because they seem volatile and on-edge
[08:27:59] <xe0n> therefore you'll have fewer resources to do the actual work
[08:28:05] <xe0n> so out of 5 say, who's on L1\on the phone
[08:28:14] <xe0n> compared to the more technical work...
[08:28:37] <xe0n> so say for instance out of the 5 "technical" people, and you've got 20 clients say...
[08:28:41] <xe0n> thats...low resources

[23:44:49] <LordOfThePings> Chatting and collaboration is a group activity with a strong need for responsible individual behavior. Rumors, innuendo and gossip can derail discussions and ruin reputations. If everybody knows something is true, who is “everybody?” Did the person you are talking to get their information from documented, factual sources, or is it hearsay? If you cannot be sure of the answer to those
[23:44:51] <LordOfThePings> questions, should you be passing on what they have said?
