[18:16:19] <eson123> is there any available Dockerfile for an existing linux distro ? like Ubuntu for example, and by that i mean the Dockerfile which they use to build the image, not the image itself
[18:16:23] <eson123> i would like to have a look at 
[18:17:34] *** Joins: jdvr (~jdvr@user/jdvr)
[18:17:40] <ikke> https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/ubuntu
[18:17:49] <BtbN> The Dockerfile to build the base image is usually just FROM scratch, ADD everything
[18:17:55] <ikke> https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core
[18:18:01] <eson123> hm yea let's me check
[18:19:22] <ikke> https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core/blob/dist-amd64/bionic/Dockerfile
[18:19:48] <eson123> erh, that looks... simple 
[18:19:59] <eson123> except the .tar.gz which i have no idea what it contains of 
[18:20:10] <BtbN> literally everything
[18:20:25] <eson123> like the kernel and all of the coreutils ?
[18:20:40] <BtbN> This is Docker
[18:20:43] <BtbN> There is no Kernel
[18:20:49] <eson123> oh right srry
[18:20:55] <eson123> probably the utilities only
[18:22:56] <ikke> https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core/blob/dist-amd64/bionic/ubuntu-bionic-oci-amd64.manifest
[18:23:34] <eson123> also isn't there any command for changing root directory ? like i used to build a dockerfile for a simple python project and it uses the same directory as my host, but with Ubuntu images, it usually has its own filesystem and its own root directory
[18:23:43] <eson123> which i expect at some points it has to do a chroot ?
[18:24:01] <BtbN> That's the whole point of using containers really
[18:24:42] <eson123> well yea but how can i do that ? i have been wondering about that
[18:24:53] <eson123> that's why i chose to look at distro dockerfile to see if there is any special commands
[18:24:58] <BtbN> do what?
[18:25:10] <eson123> create my own filesystem and directory without directing touching my host ?
[18:25:21] <BtbN> That's quite literally what docker does
[18:26:10] <ikke> eson123: https://man.archlinux.org/man/chroot.1
[18:27:13] <eson123> oh wait yea i just checked, it does seem like docker provides me my own filesystem, for some reasons my previous project keep printing my original host directory

[20:45:59] <programmerq> ash_worksi: docker doesn't care about your ssh authentication setup when you use ssh transport. neither does rsync nor git. Your ssh server doesn't even know whether the client's ssh key is passphrase protected or not.

[21:47:42] <programmerq> the docker context sets stuff under ~/.docker/ so wherever you use the `docker context` command is where it'll take effect.
[21:48:00] <programmerq> the 'docker context ls' command won't know nor care about what context is being used on some other machine.
[21:48:54] <programmerq> but yes, it's typical to ssh-add your key directly on the physical machine you are on, and then ssh to your jump host, and do work from there.
[21:49:03] <programmerq> I wouldn't ever want my ssh key on a jump host directly.
[21:49:08] <programmerq> passphrase or not
[21:50:46] <programmerq> you can also set up your ~/.ssh/config file to have agent forwarding enabled for certain hosts, and you can even set a particular host to transparently use the jump host. I never interactively log in to jump hosts in cases where I'm using one. I just set the ProxyCommand or ProxyJump directive for a given section in my ~/.ssh/config file and it just does its thing.
[21:53:12] <programmerq> and yes, that works with git, rsync, docker, and other common ssh transport methods-- as long as they either use the 'ssh' command under the hood or at least read and respect the ~/.ssh/config file
[21:53:30] * ash_worksi reads carefully
[21:54:39] <ash_worksi> programmerq: I'm gonna try this; I've always been using -J
[21:55:33] <programmerq> I work for teleport, which is a company that runs the teleport open source project. It sets up ssh *certificates* (rather than just keys) and I've successfully used docker ssh transport with it. so instead of coming in to work and starting my day by typing `ssh-add -t 8` and then have my ~/.ssh/config file with jump host configs
[21:56:32] <programmerq> I start my day with `tsh login` which grants me a user cert (the default ttl is 12h), and my ~/.ssh/config file is configured to use the teleport proxy as a jump host. (I can generate that config by running `tsh config` and I only need to do it once)
[21:56:44] <programmerq> it's pretty nice. certs are stronger security than keys.
[21:57:54] <programmerq> and yes, in the past, I would absolutely put the `ssh-add -t 8h` so my ssh-agent would remove the key automatically at the end of my shift. (I used a computer in a shared workspace and wanted that extra level of comfort knowing that my credentials couldn't be used while I was away)
[21:58:16] <programmerq> teleport would have really helped the usecase at that company, but that was a long long time ago.
[21:59:01] <ash_worksi> I um... that sounds nice, but before I embark on that, I feel it prudent to get this all squared away from an ssh standpoint
[21:59:11] <ash_worksi> erm; using ssh I mean
[21:59:32] <ash_worksi> as it stands, I DO have my key on the jump server and I *dont* like that
[21:59:36] <programmerq> yeah-- it'd be up to your administrator to implement something like teleport rather than a "regular" jump host.
[22:00:12] <programmerq> I'm just mentioning it since it's somewhat relevant to the topic.
[22:00:21] <programmerq> and yes, get that key off the jump host, lol.
[22:00:34] <ash_worksi> I mean, I wouldn't need a jump host at all if I were just setup to use a VPN on the firewall, no?
[22:01:05] <programmerq> not necessarily. those patterns provide different layers
[22:01:59] <ash_worksi> I thought, in general, jump hosts were ill-advised like several years ago (and I thought this was "because, use a VPN")
[22:01:59] <programmerq> I've certainly seen jump host plus firewall for some threat models.
[22:02:26] <programmerq> I have never seen jump hosts be advised against. just don't dump credentials there and use agent forwarding instead.
[22:02:53] <programmerq> I'm sure there are some folks who prefer the VPN model and don't understand the benefits of a jump host model.

[22:05:06] <ash_worksi> just specifying ProxyJump in my config isn't enough, right? I need to use ForwardAgent ?
[22:05:10] <programmerq> VPNs can be spoopy because you're providing a way for external devices to get into any routable internal address once connected.
[22:05:48] <programmerq> you'd want proxyjump on your laptop to get ssh to ssh to the jumphost for you. you'd want forwardagent if you want your agent forwarded. you can use both in the same Host section.
[22:06:09] <programmerq> I'd skip forwarding the agent to the jump host itself, and only forward it to the resources where you'll actually want to do agent forwarding.
[22:06:13] <programmerq> if any
[22:07:39] <programmerq> but with ProxyJump, you may not need it. Basically, your ssh client will actually talk to the Host that you specify, and can offer any local keys no problem. The ProxyJump just tells it to run a command to ssh to the specified host which would in turn do a raw tcp connection. Your local client will verify the server over that tunnel and offer the key.
[22:08:12] <ash_worksi> I see
[22:08:18] <ash_worksi> so I _dont_ need ForwardAgent
[22:12:32] <ash_worksi> programmerq: when you say, "starting my day by typing..." ; is the command `ssh-agent` configured to start-up with your machine? (ie that is a critical enough service for you to have "always on")

[22:36:12] <ash_worksi> what a pain
[22:39:12] <programmerq> ash_worksi: usually ssh-agent is already running in many environments-- macos has an ssh agent running. kde and gnome do too, last I checked. I had to manually add it to my fluxbox session stuff years and years ago when I used that (like over a decade ago)
[22:40:16] <ash_worksi> I see
[22:40:19] <ash_worksi> btw
[22:40:27] <ash_worksi> I think you might be wrong about `docker context`
[22:40:33] <programmerq> it's possible
[22:40:49] <ash_worksi> because I was having a hell of a time just now trying to reset my context back to default
[22:41:16] <ash_worksi> this is my *guess* as to why it was hanging; I'm sure I could reproduce it:
[22:42:12] <ash_worksi> I created a context using an exact ip; I guess that means it doesn't use the config from my .ssh/config file, because `docker ps` just hung after switching contexts
[22:42:30] <ash_worksi> so, I tried `docker context use default` which also hung
[22:43:03] <programmerq> if your ~/.ssh/config file doesn't have a matching block for the host you want to use, then it won't use it. So if you have Host example.com and then try to connect to 10.0.0.12, 10.0.0.12 doesn't match example.com so it won't be used.
[22:43:19] <programmerq> you can do stuff like `Host *.example.com example.com 10.0.0.*`
[22:43:43] <ash_worksi> after a while, I finally exactly specified my local machine: `docker -H unix:///... context use default` and it worked; also adding the context `docker context create --docker host=me@<host_aliased_in_conf>` worked
[22:44:08] <ash_worksi> I see
[22:44:14] <ash_worksi> that makes sense for the first part
[22:44:32] <ash_worksi> but I am suprised that if you switch contexts, you're now issuing context commands on the remote machine
[22:45:20] <ash_worksi> ah, I mean, I guess that's not right....
[22:46:02] <ash_worksi> okay, my new theory is, docker tries to resolve the host first before discovering "oh, you want to use the context command" and showing you the local machines contexts
[22:46:23] <ash_worksi> or the act of invoking `docker context` tries the connections
[22:46:26] <programmerq> that may be the case. do you have DOCKER_HOST set at all?

[23:20:06] <ash_worksi> programmerq: no output, just hangs
[23:22:20] <programmerq> if you're running strace, it'll go into that file specified by '-o docker.strace'
[23:22:36] <ash_worksi> programmerq: does the same thing happen to you when you try this: `docker context create bork --docker "host=ssh://10.0.0.1"; docker context use bork; docker context use default` ?
[23:22:49] <ash_worksi> programmerq: I ran the command as you specified
[23:23:04] <programmerq> yup, so you can see what is taking so long by inspecting the output in that file.
[23:23:10] <ash_worksi> OH
[23:23:23] <programmerq> like if it's retrying a network connection, or trying to open a file.
[23:24:01] *** Quits: justOkay (~justache@user/justache) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:24:13] <programmerq> it's all the syscalls that were spawned by that command. the `-f` says to follow any child threads or pids (including an ssh calls, if any). The `-tt` says to include timestamps. the `-T` puts the duration at the end of the line. `-v` is verbose mode (helpful sometimes)
[23:24:37] <programmerq> it's a LOT of info in there, but if you can look at the timestamp and durations you should be able to see what calls take so long.
[23:25:24] *** Joins: justOkay (~justache@user/justache)
[23:25:27] <programmerq> 'docker context create' does try to hit the remote docker. I did see that my 'docker context use' would try to hit /var/run/docker.sock locally no matter what my active context was. I didn't have a dockerd running in my environment for the test.
[23:25:48] <programmerq> I had a fresh home directory, so nothing fancy or funny about the default context
[23:26:20] <ash_worksi> programmerq: seems to be repeating this: https://gist.github.com/ash-m/877c5ea46345165ca477523b83a1c764
[23:27:52] <ash_worksi> it doesn't really make sense to me
[23:28:21] <programmerq> yeah, that looks like it's waiting on something that was initiated further up. "epoll_pwait(3 " indicates that it's waiting on file descriptor 3. There could be an open or connect further up that ends with " = 3 <0.000011>" (or whatever its duration is-- the important part will be the " = 3" to see what it is.
[23:28:33] <programmerq> )
[23:28:38] <programmerq> I can't leave an open paren, lol
[23:29:34] <ash_worksi> programmerq: before it gets in that loop, this is the last thing I see: connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(22), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.0.0.1")}, 16 <unfinished ...>
[23:30:13] <programmerq> is that 10.0.0.1 one of the contexts? is it the current context, or the one you're switching to?
[23:30:28] <programmerq> I wasn't able to get mine to try to hit my current context when I would switch
[23:33:57] <ash_worksi> starting from the default normal working context, it is: docker create context bork --docker 'host=ssh://10.0.0.1'; docker context use bork; strace ...`
[23:34:08] <ash_worksi> programmerq: if you want I can PM you the full strace
[23:34:55] <programmerq> again, the 'docker context create ...' command *will* attempt to connect to the daemon you specify, and if that hangs, then it will hang.
[23:35:11] <programmerq> once created, you shouldn't see a hang on 'docker context use ...' alone.
[23:35:47] <programmerq> I can make it hang on purpose by doing 'DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@10.0.0.1 docker context use default' (10.0.0.1 in my environment will time out after sitting)
[23:36:02] <programmerq> but that's the only way I could make 'docker context use' hang

[23:48:45] <ash_worksi> say I create a redis password that is some random string as a docker secret; and now I want to actually check some keys directly on the server; I need to auth with the secret I created... is it possible to do that?
[23:49:08] <ash_worksi> or is this one of those situations where I need to store the actual string apart from docker secrets?
[23:49:25] <programmerq> you can access it from a pod where it is mounted.
[23:49:27] <programmerq> err task*
[23:49:28] <ash_worksi> (ie: know what the string is so you can manually issue the `AUTH <string>` )
[23:49:59] <ash_worksi> programmerq: I know I can access it, but redis-cli wont let me do anything unless I know what the password is
[23:50:35] <programmerq> okay, access it and then use it.
[23:51:56] <ash_worksi> which means I have to manage the password apart from docker secrets

[23:52:27] <ash_worksi> to people normally have a sort of central location for managing passwords like that? like some IPA or something
[23:52:33] <ash_worksi> do*
[23:52:38] <programmerq> no, you can access the secret from inside a container that has it attached.
[23:52:44] <programmerq> so you don't need to use an external thing
[23:52:51] <programmerq> I normally do, but it isn't a hard requirement.
[23:53:02] <programmerq> access the string you need from a container that has the secret attached, and then use it where you want to use it.
[23:53:27] <ash_worksi> from /var/docker/secrets or wherever?
