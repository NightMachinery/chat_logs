[02:39:23] <Joanna> JimBuntu: that is yet another stupid thing people do after paving the farmland over for cars to drive on, they move the agriculture out to the desert and pump up water from glaciers that melted thousands of years ago which is not coming back. They also like to pollute the ground water with pesticides and fertilizers so that it can never be used for drinking again. So it’s now impossible to go back to sustainable farming communities 
[02:39:23] <Joanna> in many places. Not only that they are hellbent upon destroying the genetics of everything they can get their hands upon especially food crops.
[02:43:55] <Joanna> I once watched a documentary about farming in France and the guy was spraying crops wearing what looked like a space suit and testicular cancer was fairly common there. Why people do such stupid things and don’t just do organic farming is beyond me. I guess they got tricked and are staying the course.
[02:54:02] <Joanna> jan6: did you watch the Kaiba series?
[02:54:14] <jan6> series?
[02:54:24] <Joanna> The animae
[02:54:35] <jan6> it's a single movie, afaik
[02:54:58] <jan6> also maybe, not sure, possibly, but not recently
[02:55:02] <Joanna> Oh I’ve been watching it on YouTube
[02:55:19] <jan6> of course
[02:55:59] <jan6> I ain't gonna pay money for virtual entertainment, whenever possible
[02:56:05] <Joanna> The story is hard to follow I probably will watch twice

[04:25:48] <Joanna> That was interesting. I’ve never thought of buttons before
[04:27:18] <Joanna> I wonder how flammable the fabric is after he finishes
[04:29:13] <Joanna> jan6:
[04:29:59] <jan6> probably no more than usual
[04:30:23] <jan6> since y'know, silicon isn't really flammable, and the naphta or whatever solvant you use, evaporates
[04:30:31] <jan6> and you can wash it afterwards I guess
[04:31:07] <Joanna> Actually the buttons are a less elegant version of how garters used to attach to nylon stockings
[04:32:31] *** Roey is now known as roey
[04:32:40] <Joanna> I wonder if it’s permanently waterproof
[04:32:50] <jan6> the buttons are real elegant, because you can reposition them, and leave the fabric untouched
[04:32:54] *** roey is now known as Roey
[04:33:32] <Joanna> Same with old garters
[04:34:04] <jan6> it's not permanent, of course, but still for quite long, even plastic tarps aren't permanently waterproof, because, y'know, fatigue
[04:34:47] <jan6> there are also aerosol waterproofing cans, of course
[04:35:10] <jan6> which would be great for fixing smaller leaky parts of such a treated tarp
[04:36:26] <jan6> the aerosol ones are also especially helpful for stuff like boots, which you might not want to dump into a solution
[04:37:25] <jan6> but y'know, how it works is simply by having a physical layer of silicone in the way, so water physically cannot get into the fabric, or through it
[04:38:16] <jan6> with enough use, it will still start to leak, and due to imperfections/dry spots when treating it in the first place, it's gonna be uneven as to when, and where, it's gonna happen
[04:38:35] <Joanna> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/onfm16eT/1643764107.JPG
[04:39:16] <jan6> but on the positive side, if you dunk it in, it gets to BOTH sides, plus also inbetween
[04:39:24] <Joanna> Yea
[04:40:09] *** Quits: wwrrtt (~a5y17lte1@user/a5y17lte123) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:40:12] <Joanna> That stuff also causes air pollution. This should really be done in a place where solvent can be reused
[04:40:16] *** Joins: user_ (~a5y17lte1@user/a5y17lte123)
[04:40:25] <jan6> the one you showed seems inferior, for the simple fact you need a specific metal thingamajig, instead of the simplicity of any rope + any small thing
[04:40:37] <jan6> you can't reuse solvent, lol
[04:40:43] <jan6> especially not evaporated one
[04:41:06] <jan6> that's about as helpless as capturing the evaporated alcohol from a pub/bar/etc
[04:41:24] <Joanna> Yes you can if you evaporate the solvent then capture and distill it
[04:41:33] <jan6> what I just said
[04:41:45] <jan6> also if you distill it, it's not the same stuff anymore
[04:42:09] <jan6> because it's a combination, a mix of many things
[04:42:31] <Joanna> Put soaked sheet in sealed container and change the pressure like freeze drying
[04:42:44] <jan6> so what?
[04:43:23] <Joanna> I’m saying it’s possible to recapture the solvent. Same as capturing alcohol from a still
[04:44:22] <jan6> you're not gonna magically be able to reuse that stuff, especially because you'd need to remove the coated fabric, without letting the solvent escape, and also need to keep the solvent at that different pressure, else it'll just re-evaporate again
[04:44:48] <Joanna> It’s fine if one guy does it could you imagine if a raincoat factory puts all the evaporated solvent into the air ?
[04:45:03] <jan6> plus even at best case, you're gonna get too little back, for it to matter, anyway
[04:45:24] <jan6> a factory has SCALE, and at SCALE, even small things help
[04:45:53] <Joanna> How do you think dry cleaners work?
[04:46:11] <jan6> I don't care
[04:47:23] <Joanna> This doesn’t involve dirty things so the solvent will be clean . I guess you never have seen distillation in a chemistry lab.
[04:49:08] <jan6> I'm not saying that capturing evaporated stuff is impossible, I'm saying that 1) you can't get a mix back into a liquid, from evaporated form, without significant extra energy costs, since different parts evaporate, and react, with different stuff, at different speeds and temperatures, and 2) even if you could, you wouldn't get back enough, for a home user to be of any use, unless you wanna
[04:49:09] <jan6> waterproof 3 tarps, and use leftover to waterproof like a singular thin glove, or sock, or something
[04:49:18] <jan6> alcohol is *A LOT* more simple
[04:50:44] <jan6> you can't really catch evaporated alcohol and stuff it back into a drinkable-tasting drink, but you can catch pure alcohol, because alcohol has pretty simple chemical makeup, and for almost all the uses, you want it pure, anyway
[04:53:01] <jan6> like, "In different industries and regions naphtha may also be crude oil or refined products such as kerosene.", how're you gonna re-bottle that, is my point
[04:53:25] <jan6> you could use other solvents, but problem still stands
[04:53:30] <jan6> it's a mix of a lot of stuff
[04:54:16] <jan6> you can collect the drips, of course
[04:54:53] <jan6> e.g. wring it dry, before setting it to fully dry, and use that drip, again
[04:57:04] <jan6> you can of course prove me wrong, if you actually succeed, or can link to someone succeeding in capturing naptha, silicone solvant, or other mixed stuff with complex makeups
[04:59:51] <jan6> alcohol, water, and such simple stuff don't count, because alcohol for example doesn't react much, and is very simple, at its core, not counting for "mixed" stuff, and alcohol+water mixture would also not be enough, both too simple
[05:07:34] <Joanna> If the naphtha evaporates it can be captured. In chemistry labs the steam passes into a cooling tube and turns back to liquid.
[05:15:11] <jan6> the question is if you want to waste more energy than you save
[05:18:17] <Joanna> It’s not just about saving energy it’s about not polluting the environment...

[22:33:52] <jan6> phones and smartphones are different, btw
[22:34:27] <jan6> e.g. non-smartphones basically never have GPS, and rarely have wifi, even the fancy 4g-capable ones
[22:34:43] <jan6> nor a front camera
[22:34:58] <jan6> or possibly even distance sensor
[22:34:58] *** Quits: Darkcoal (~user@user/Darkcoal) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:36:39] <jan6> etc, plus of course, different dumbphones and feature-phones have different OSs entirely, so you'd also need more specific knowledge, before you can exploit them, if you can at all

[22:49:15] <Bitweasil> ... disagree.
[22:49:37] <Bitweasil> I have a modern enough KaiOS flip phone, and it has GPS and wifi.
[22:49:45] <Bitweasil> Almost all the KaiOS devices have those features.
[22:49:49] <Bitweasil> Now, you can turn them off, but...
[22:50:16] <Bitweasil> I wouldn't expect KaiOS is particularly hard to exploit, but it doesn't have nearly as much information as a smartphone either.
[22:57:45] <JimBuntu> slight correction, feature phones were when GPS and aGPS started. All modern feature phones (in the USA) are required to have at least aGPS
[22:59:00] <Bitweasil> And I'm not aware of any that aren't KaiOS with full GPS, though if you know of any...
[22:59:33] <JimBuntu> I'm not in the cellular biz any more, but I was when that rule went into effect. I have not looked at feature phones in quite a while
[23:00:13] <JimBuntu> For a short while, we offered a service with select phones where we would physically disable the aGPS
[23:02:48] <Bitweasil> I think the 911 services require that now?
[23:04:45] <Bitweasil> Hm, I guess there are some based on custom AOSP images.

[23:32:56] <jan6> kaiOS is a smartphone OS, tho, for low-powered ones
[23:33:01] <jan6> a knockoff of Firefox OS
[23:33:31] <Bitweasil> I'm aware.  But it's neither Android nor iOS.  I'm not aware of anything lower powered out there that's still capable of texting and MMS and such.
[23:34:13] *** Joins: Darkcoal (~user@user/Darkcoal)
[23:34:16] <jan6> this is what I meant with the different OSs, but there's plenty that aren't kai, e.g. nokia still has the "s30+ OS" or whatever
[23:34:21] <jan6> on some phones
[23:34:33] <jan6> or was it samsung, meh, whatever
[23:34:36] <Bitweasil> Oh?  Wasn't aware of that, what runs those?
[23:34:52] <JimBuntu> yeah, Brew development ended a few weeks ago... but there are still other OS out there for feature phnoes
[23:35:04] <Bitweasil> Hm, ok.  I may have to dig around more then.
[23:35:33] <JimBuntu> Let's not forget WebOS when talking about smartphone OSs though ;)
[23:36:18] <JimBuntu> and if talking about older phones anyway... the precurser to Android... DangerOS
[23:36:20] <jan6> basically you have tiers of "basic phone with custom OS, that can only do pure basic tasks" "basic phone, with slightly more features, and still a custom OS" "standard KaiOS device" "crappy android device" "normal android/ios/whatever"
[23:36:39] <Bitweasil> Sadly, older phones don't work with my carrier, they've moved to VoLTE only. :(
[23:36:47] <jan6> oof
[23:37:07] <JimBuntu> I still have a bunch of 3G equipment... phones/dongles all of it
[23:37:42] <jan6> over here, 3g and 2g are still up, although I think they wanted to take one of those down, at some point...but then didn't, I guess...
[23:38:15] <JimBuntu> lol, I still have a 'functional' Handspring Visor with PCS Springboard
[23:38:34] <jan6> I think they wanted to take 3g down, since it's redundant, 2g has way wider service, so great for fallback, and 4g has way better speeds and features, so 3g is just in the weird in-between zone
[23:41:13] <Bitweasil> Sounds about right.
[23:41:48] <JimBuntu> 1X data FTW
[23:45:37] <JimBuntu> of course, for billing purposes, when using cellular they record what tower(s) you used. So, at a minimum level they have that data.  Even long ago they were tracking what accounts were connected to what tower... and it used to be (might still be the case) that if you simply pulled your battery then the tower(s) would do a little freak out because you went from seen to unseen instantly... and it would create a
[23:45:39] <JimBuntu> ripple across the nationwide network to attempt to locate your device
[23:46:21] <JimBuntu> If you did this enough, it would cause a flag on your account to activate... activate that flag enough and an automated process might send you a letter or you might get a phone call about it.
[23:48:56] <JimBuntu> I can also share that they track how often any given tower detects dropped calls... enough dropped calls and they will send out a technician to monitor it locally and figure out what's up.  We had a visit from a technician before at the place I worked because we apparently generated enough dropped calls to warrant one to come out and sit in out parking lot near the tower.

[23:53:39] <jan6> I'm pretty sure that your "flag" wouldn't get set if you shut it down properly, and so let it tell them "I'm going out" ;P
[23:54:46] <jan6> if you just drop off the radar, then of course panic-searching makes a little bit of sense, since "it has to be SOMEWHERE, right?!?!?", and due to higher drain, costs them more
