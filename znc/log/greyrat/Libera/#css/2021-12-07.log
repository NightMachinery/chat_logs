[10:47:33] <b0nn> I get that it's a mess - that's because I am feeling around in the dark
[10:49:20] <oksushi> b0nn: I’d guess you have inline elements there, and once you add a letter you’re messing with the vertical-align
[10:49:50] <oksushi> in your inspector, find out what the diffferent values of vertical-align have on those sqaures
[10:50:41] <b0nn> sorry how do I find the vertical-align
[10:51:06] <b0nn> the inspector isn't writing it where i am looking
[10:51:21] <oksushi> inspect the element
[10:52:01] <b0nn> yeah - I am - there's no "vertical-align"
[10:52:04] <b0nn> firefox
[10:52:18] <oksushi> try adding it
[10:53:37] <oksushi> you can see the effect here https://codepen.io/oksushi/pen/bGopbjN
[10:54:02] <oksushi> then in my test case, add “vertical-align: top;”
[10:55:11] <oksushi> if you can share a link to your actual page so I can use the inspector on your code, I’d be able to give you a better direction
[10:55:19] <b0nn> ok adding that kept all the boxes in one line
[10:55:33] <b0nn> the page is localhost:7777 :)
[10:55:33] <oksushi> nice work
[10:55:57] <b0nn> the text is in the upper left hand corner when I want that centered
[10:56:57] <b0nn> ok, thanks oksushi that's got me going again :)
[10:57:01] <oksushi> try some other values of vertical-align — your inspector will show you what you can apply
[10:57:13] <oksushi> most likely you want some text-align there too
[10:57:36] <b0nn> yeah text-align:center; took it to the horizontal center
[10:57:43] <b0nn> the vertial alignment is next
[10:58:18] <b0nn> if I vertical-align: center; it breaks again

[21:03:08] <PenguinMan98> You can clearly see flex is adding the gaps
[21:04:24] <z1haze> do you have margins on something?
[21:04:30] <PenguinMan98> nope
[21:04:43] <PenguinMan98> Removed them all in favor of gap
[21:05:00] <z1haze> yeah, gap should help with collapsed margins and stuff
[21:05:16] <z1haze> i dunno man, its hard to tell from an image
[21:05:41] <z1haze> it looks like to me 2 flex containers
[21:06:05] <z1haze> anything inside of the flex element wont scale up to height
[21:06:12] <z1haze> only the child of the flex container will
[21:06:40] <z1haze> is there no margin on the button or anything like that

[21:08:54] <PenguinMan98> Aha. This is interesting. The outer block is also a flex container and when I turn that off, it fixes the insides

[21:09:18] <PenguinMan98> Now it repros
[21:10:37] <PenguinMan98> Weird how the outer flex box would create an issue for the inner one

[21:17:43] <z1haze> align-items: flex-start on the flex container will make the height of the children auto
[21:18:11] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/01mc8yzo/1/
[21:18:16] <PenguinMan98> Which wouldn't have been a problem. The gap would fix it
[21:19:01] <PenguinMan98> Oh, and the fixed height is a feature, not a bug
[21:19:30] <z1haze> display: flex will provide a consistent height of children
[21:19:31] <z1haze> yeah
[21:19:46] <z1haze> unless you align-items
[21:20:08] <PenguinMan98> The default for align-items is stretch
[21:20:25] <PenguinMan98> So, yeah
[21:20:28] <z1haze> which is why they would be the same height :D
[21:20:37] <z1haze> is this not the result you want though
[21:20:43] <PenguinMan98> Which is why I did align-items: flex-start

[21:41:32] <michigan> I'm working on this header consisting of a SwiperJS touch-slider and a menu button: https://jsfiddle.net/ccccssssssss/fkLcm5p9/11/ - any chance you guys know how to prevent the slider from pushing the menu button out to the side?
[21:45:06] <PenguinMan98> Well, where do you want it instead?
[21:45:24] <michigan> One sec let me show
[21:45:42] <michigan> I mean, I want them both to fit inside the window
[21:46:45] <michigan> Maybe there's some awesome flexbox or grid property I'm missing out on? :)
[21:48:34] <PenguinMan98> https://jsfiddle.net/uo3y9qdh/4/
[21:48:42] <PenguinMan98> Perhaps you can try this
[21:48:53] <PenguinMan98> It relies on budgeting exactly 40px for the menu button
[21:49:42] *** Joins: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman)
[21:49:42] <PenguinMan98> Then probably add an overflow: hidden
[21:49:44] <michigan> Yeah that'd work
[21:50:47] <PenguinMan98> I also removed the margin on the menu button and used gap instead
[21:56:35] <michigan> Cool! Thanks man :) I'm going for this (unless you flexbox/grid heads have a better solution)

[22:01:09] <PenguinMan98> Nice!
[22:01:23] <PenguinMan98> I do like more dynamic solutions
[22:02:01] <PenguinMan98> Though it does seem counter-intuitive to use flex-grow to make something smaller
[22:02:02] <PenguinMan98> LOL
[22:02:18] <michigan> haha yeah :)
[22:04:49] <michigan> Actually seems we dont need to use it at all, woks fine with just overflow hidden

[22:05:25] <michigan> Yep :)
[22:06:11] <PenguinMan98> I'd be wary of using a package for something that's only a few lines of javascript to build myself.
[22:07:05] <michigan> True that..
[22:07:08] <PenguinMan98> There's something to be said for having the flexibility to tweak it at a low level and not have to bug a developer.

[22:09:54] <PenguinMan98> The higher ups here generally operate on the principle of build it ourselves so we can maintain it ourselves.
[22:10:22] <PenguinMan98> This does free us from depending too much on other teams and technologies.
[22:10:34] <PenguinMan98> But it also means our app is stone age simple.
