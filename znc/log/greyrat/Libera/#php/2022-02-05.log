[00:06:01] <da_wunder> $114 for what license ?

[00:12:24] <olle> Hm, is it OK to mock a function or method, assuming it will be called x times. Or is that relying too much on internal structure?
[00:13:27] <da_wunder> olle: if that is your _test_ then - imho - you should check that
[00:13:30] <__adrian> depends. probably too coupled.
[00:14:09] <biberu> why is it important that it's called x timed? what does it tell you in this case?
[00:14:09] <__adrian> e.g., if you're testing  $callbacker->call($myfunc)->repeat(3)  then yes
[00:14:18] <olle> I have a loop on an array, and for SOME iterations it will call the db. I want to mock that call
[00:15:13] <__adrian> that sounds like a no
[00:15:15] <da_wunder> so then you should how many times you're calling that - right?
[00:15:35] <__adrian> "for some it will" under what circumstances?
[00:15:38] <biberu> would it be better to e.g. filter it separately?
[00:16:32] <olle> __adrian: Depending on input to that function, so certain rows in array will trigger that db call
[00:17:07] <__adrian> still sounds iffy
[00:17:10] <olle> Mm
[00:17:24] <da_wunder> so write different test case for all of thsoe
[00:17:30] <olle> __adrian: But the other alternative is to mock the db connection? You end up with similar situation.
[00:17:36] <biberu> olle: got an example?
[00:17:38] <da_wunder> s/thsoe/those
[00:17:43] <olle> biberu: I do kind of, sec
[00:17:54] <__adrian> can you concievably change the implementation to call the db more/less times? or not at all? but still do its job?
[00:18:33] <olle> https://github.com/LimeSurvey/LimeSurvey/blob/master/application/models/SurveyActivator.php#L198
[00:18:36] <olle> Example call in loop
[00:19:14] <olle> __adrian: Yes, to lift out the db call, right? :) It's pretty entangled with business logic (which is the point of this particular use-case, too)
[00:19:44] <__adrian> is the whole point of the function to find {x} items in an array and pass them to this other function?
[00:20:10] <olle> __adrian: The point of the function is to figure out the layout of a dynamically created database table, depending on the input
[00:20:10] <__adrian> as in, you could rename the method you're testing  ->findFoosAndCallBar($list)  ?

[00:20:22] <__adrian> hm
[00:21:01] <__adrian> k.
[00:21:09] <olle> I pondering on wrapping the db call in a run() function, and then in the test, just tell run() to return x on first call, y on second, etc.
[00:21:10] <__adrian> i'm gonna just say, no idea. it depends
[00:21:14] <olle> :)
[00:21:28] <olle> Yeah. Maybe I'll write a blog post and let internet decide. ^^
[00:21:50] <olle> I would never apply this in production code anyway, it's kind of theoretical
[00:21:53] <__adrian> if you control the inputs, then you should know what items should be passed to the mocked function, yes?
[00:22:02] <__adrian> why not look for those items?
[00:22:59] <olle> Look from where?
[00:23:09] <__adrian> in your mocked function
[00:23:53] <olle> Hm hm hm
[00:24:00] <biberu> ^ should be enough to just pass in some questions of that type and see that the output matches the expectations, no?
[00:24:27] <__adrian> $mock = function ($arg) { $expected = [...]; if (isset($expected[$arg])) { $r = $expected[$arg]; unset($expected[$arg]); return $r; } throw ... }
[00:25:04] <__adrian> well kinda like that, a little more complex to ensure all were actually called
[00:25:13] <biberu> olle: odd placement of the default case btw
[00:25:18] <__adrian> but i think phpunit has stuff to manage things like that
[00:25:43] <__adrian> wouldn't be too hard to pull it out somewhere it can be introspeced though
[00:26:01] <olle> biberu: yikes, I couldn't even find it. Yes, odd. Not covered by PSR-12 enforcement yet...

[00:32:32] <da_wunder> malmalmal: what license?
[00:32:41] <malmalmal> Kirby CMS
[00:33:17] <da_wunder> and the price of that?
[00:33:20] <malmalmal> flatfile
[00:33:37] <malmalmal> the price is... 99€ per site + vat if applicable
[00:34:01] <malmalmal> you can learn all about it in their site
[00:35:12] <da_wunder> and that is nothing - imho - literally that is less than we're billing on our customers for one hour
[00:35:50] <Albright> malmalmal: Why would talking about a PHP CMS be offtopic here? :P
[00:36:19] <malmalmal> I am used to support channels being support only, no chat
[00:36:24] <malmalmal> but I see
[00:36:37] <Albright> Yeah, maybe I shouldn't judge it without trying it. Last week I paid $50 for a Git client when there are plenty of free alternatives, so I'm not *totally* against the idea of paying for good software.
[00:37:16] <malmalmal> Kirby's worth it in my oppinion, at least if you compare it with something like WP, but attention it is flat file based (although it can interact with a db)
[00:38:51] <relipse> Albright: what git client?
[00:39:12] <da_wunder> malmalmal: and really just talk with your client about this - you should be able to tell them why that "kirby" thing should be used and what it's solving - versus that you make that yourself from scratch
[00:39:15] <Albright> relipse: Fork. Used SourceTree for years but it doesn't look like Atlassian is interested in updating it anymore.
[00:39:41] <relipse> i can't get used to any git clients really, only use git status git commit -am and git commit -m and git push
[00:39:50] <malmalmal> da_wunder: you got me wrong, I use kirby all the time for client work, I ONLY use kirby actually
[00:40:41] <da_wunder> malmalmal: wo shy don't you cover that cost on your clients then?
[00:40:57] <Albright> relipse: Fair enough. I think it's faster to scan through diffs and revert parts of files using a graphical client most of the time but to each their own.
[00:41:39] <malmalmal> da_wunder: again, you got me wrong i DO cover that cost on my clients, I was defending Kirby, it was Albright who questioned its price
[00:42:40] <malmalmal> "questioned"
[00:43:03] <malmalmal> more like just expressed relative sadness at its price tag
[00:44:15] <da_wunder> malmalmal: for me that comment "23:03 < malmalmal> the price is... 99€ per site + vat if applicable" looks like that _you_ don't like that pricing
[00:44:45] <malmalmal> no I was just answering the question about the price

[00:49:05] <da_wunder> not sure what timezone you're so giving some timestamp is quite pointless
[00:50:15] <malmalmal> one hour earlier, so you'd lool at 22:00:49 but does not really matter that much anyway
[00:54:01] <da_wunder> your post "22:00 < malmalmal> Kartagis: I'd reccomend kirby over WP any day..." doesn't really say anything about you answering price question

[01:10:51] <judah> I stole a bunch of clients from a former employer like that. They charged $99/mo for basic WordPress hosting. I set up the exact same thing and charged $5/mo.
[01:11:05] <judah> They tried to sue, but the thing about signing non-competes while a minor...
[01:11:31] <Albright> You should have chard $49. :P

[01:14:33] <Albright> But I know when you're young, smaller amounts of money seem amazing.
[01:14:46] <da_wunder> what I have done last 17+ years is custom applications for several clients - and pricing like 99€/month is just something that doesn't happen
[01:14:57] <Albright> I remember thinking how incredible it'd be to make $200 a month. I could buy a whole new Sega Genesis every month if I wanted to!
[01:15:07] <da_wunder> even dev work cost more than that per hour
[01:15:12] <stenno> da_wunder: i understood though that it was just for hosting
[01:15:54] <judah> what does a MSP charge for hosting these days?
[01:17:12] <stenno> you can get a dedicated server for 100 euro per month
[01:17:19] <Albright> What's an MSP?
[01:17:20] <da_wunder> for hosting we use aws / gcp / azure - and just add some margin to that price and customers are paying those just nicely - and the costs (last I checked multiple projects) was like ~120-360€/month
[01:17:21] <stenno> a beast of a server
[01:17:54] <judah> Albright, managed service provider
[01:18:16] <Albright> Ah.
[01:18:43] <judah> I have found the main problem with breaking into the business is that you cant compete with things like shopify and wp-engine
[01:19:15] <judah> Why should you pay me $xxx/mo instead of paying $5/mo for a WordPress host? Well, ill have to get back to you.
[01:19:55] <Albright> Yeah, my first serious web dev gig eventually turned into hosting a couple dozen Drupal sites on the same VPN. We paid, I donno, $40/mo for the VPN account? And pretty sure my boss was charging our clients at least that much each.
[01:21:19] <Albright> judah: Because I have X years experience building web sites and could get your site up and running faster and more safely than you can do it yourself. I can also customize the behavior to make it behave exactly as you'd like. Are you satisfied with merely "good enough" for your site, or do you want something special?
[01:21:31] <Albright> I mean, that'd be my approach as a dev. I guess hosting would be slightly different.
[01:22:03] <Albright> I guess stress that they'd have your phone number and can call 24/7 with their concerns (but please don't)

[16:33:18] <Na_Klar> Are there still ways to get your ssl certificate signed without costs? can't find any service anymore ..
[16:33:27] <Na_Klar> (hardly php related tho=
[16:34:06] <AllenJB> There are a number of free TLS certificate authorities, the most well known being LetsEncrypt
[16:35:55] <Na_Klar> I'll check that rn
[16:42:00] <Na_Klar> okay, that's a good project, but it seems to need a certificate managment agent. Is there a service which accepts a classic CSR?
[16:43:19] <TinoDidriksen> Na_Klar, https://letsencrypt.org/
[16:44:03] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, you wanted an old fashioned one. Why? LE is much better.
[16:44:14] <AllenJB> Never done it myself, but I believe at least some LE clients allow you to specify / modify the CSR. What's your use case?
[16:44:41] <TinoDidriksen> LE can be set up as a rather simple cron job.
[16:45:14] <AllenJB> You could try searching or asking on https://community.letsencrypt.org/
[16:48:18] <Na_Klar> TinoDidriksen: AllenJB: I generate the certs on my server with the openssl cli tool and just need a CA to sign my CSR. As I understood LE, I have to install some agent on my machine, which I would like to avoid.

[17:51:32] <newwebdev13> Hi , i have a question about node.js with php , i want to use node.js in php (or php in node.js) is that possible ? for example can i use php with mern stack or include mern in php ? i have a lot of php projects and i dont want to write again some stuff with js also i more like php :D but i need to learn new framework,technology so i want to use node.js with php
[17:52:50] <da_wunder> I would just make your PHP side to make requests to your node.js application - so that your node.js and php applications are totally separated things
[18:12:31] <newwebdev13> i want to use both of them same project not separated , for example <? <? php stuff ?> [node.js stuff] ?> ; is that possible without separted file , port, requests or routing
[18:17:48] <da_wunder> nope that is not possible
[18:18:45] <da_wunder> usually php is server via webserver like apache, nginx and using eg. php-fpm while node.js usually uses express to serve those routes

[18:20:15] <da_wunder> that is why I said that you should use two totally separated applications there - one is PHP and another one is Node.js - and if/when you need to communicate between those applications - just create request from php/node.js application to node.js/php application and do what you need to do

[18:29:19] <__adrian> "i have a lot of php projects and ..."  so note, you should have one application (program) _per application (thing it does)_, not simply "one for php and one for node."
[18:29:51] <__adrian> make them all separate and single-focus and then make something that lets them all talk to each other.
[18:37:23] *** Quits: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:39:11] <newwebdev13> hmm so best way separated and communicated php and node.js , which one is best for communications each other or it does not matter , php based app call node.js stuff or node.js based...
[18:40:32] <da_wunder> easiest way is just to make some http requests between those, but then you most likely need to use somekind of authentication
[18:41:19] <da_wunder> another thing that you could use is eg. rabbitmq - you send a message to queuee from php/node.js application and then in other side you listen that queuee and do what you need to do
[18:43:32] <da_wunder> and we cannot really say which is the "best" way - we don't know your application domain
[18:43:42] <__adrian> http apis are extremely useful regardless though  ;)
[18:55:20] <newwebdev13> thank you all , i got some idea , i will try your suggestions :)
