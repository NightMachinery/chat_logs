[15:23:48] <LordKalma> you're uploading full LLVM? THANK YOU
[15:23:52] <LordKalma> also, add 14, just released
[15:24:16] <very_sneaky> it's not mine - there are problems with getting it to run on the cci ci runners, i just helped profile it
[15:24:42] <very_sneaky> but it does build fine
[15:25:06] <LordKalma> okay
[15:25:09] <LordKalma> that recipe isn't good
[15:25:14] <LordKalma> it's not just aobut projects
[15:25:16] <LordKalma> it's about runtimes also
[15:25:48] <very_sneaky> eli5?
[15:26:10] <LordKalma> llvm's cmake command is split between "projects" and "runtimes"
[15:26:16] <LordKalma> runtimes are built with the just-build compiler
[15:26:21] <LordKalma> and they are missing them totally
[15:26:35] <very_sneaky> what are the runtimes for
[15:26:37] <LordKalma> and for example, to use project clang, you should build runtime libcxx and libcxxabi on non-windows
[15:26:48] <LordKalma> Full list:
[15:26:49] <LordKalma> LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS: clang;clang-tools-extra;cross-project-tests;libc;libclc;lld;lldb;openmp;polly;pstl
[15:26:49] <LordKalma> LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES: compiler-rt;libc;libcxx;libcxxabi;libunwind;openmp
[15:27:00] <LordKalma> if you choose something as a runtime, you can't have it as a project and vice-versa
[15:27:20] <LordKalma> libcxxabi;libunwind;compiler-rt only work on non-msvc
[15:27:53] <very_sneaky> so, they've got them all as projects, rather than segmented into `project` and `runtime` which would be more appropriate?
[15:27:54] <LordKalma> cross-project-tests shouldn't be needed. libc also doesn't build on msvc, obviously
[15:28:17] <LordKalma> the problem is that tey have this line:
[15:28:17] <LordKalma> https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/pull/7613/files#diff-812b4e11de47e40b8dcea774555fd46d9e233898b264334975b560a144d27705R77
[15:28:22] <LordKalma> they put them all as projects
[15:28:32] <very_sneaky> gotcha
[15:28:36] <LordKalma> if I make with_libcxx: True it'll add as a project
[15:28:40] <LordKalma> and that'«s just *wrong*

[15:39:04] <very_sneaky> interesting - i didn't think they allowed binary builds on cci
[15:40:08] <very_sneaky> looking at the mingw-w64 recipe, it looks like it builds from source using autotools

[15:43:09] <LordKalma> Added a bunch of comments
[15:43:22] <LordKalma> if they don't comply I'll have to review the recipe myself after it gets merged
[15:44:09] <very_sneaky> they've seemed pretty responsive to feedback
[15:45:56] <LordKalma> So much discussion on making it fit into the CI runners and none of them cared to find out that LLVM provides LLVM_PARALLEL_COMPILE_JOBS and LLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS
[15:46:24] <LordKalma> the latter is especially relevant, as linking is notoriously agressive
[15:49:03] <very_sneaky> they did - parallel building is disabled in the recipe
[15:49:06] <very_sneaky> also debug builds atm
[15:50:39] <LordKalma> maybe it's gcc that has a heavy linker
[15:50:42] <LordKalma> works fine on msvc :D
[15:50:58] <LordKalma> (and release builds are easier, of course=
[15:51:02] <very_sneaky> ah, they've just disabled it via cmake though - so effectively passing `make -j1` or whatever
[15:51:22] <LordKalma> I wonder if their CI runners use ninja
[15:51:46] <very_sneaky> shouldn't matter i don't think - it's on the cmake helper interface
[15:51:51] <very_sneaky> i'd imagine that would abstract that
[15:52:26] <LordKalma> I think not, because of that think they discussed the other day about some PR
[15:54:15] <LordKalma> very_sneaky, because of this: https://github.com/conan-io/conan/blob/develop/conans/client/build/cmake.py#L160
[15:54:17] <LordKalma> more specifically https://github.com/conan-io/conan/blob/develop/conans/client/build/cmake_flags.py#L114
[15:54:51] <LordKalma> "Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell the native build system how to choose a compiler."

[15:55:58] <very_sneaky> yeah okay, guess it makes sense that they don't provide compatibility for everything. Looks like ninja is fine though: https://github.com/conan-io/conan/blob/4f7bb66702a346b1dec031eb27fae4f2362313bb/conans/client/build/cmake.py#L301-L306
[15:56:51] <LordKalma> Qt 6 also uses Ninja
[15:57:08] <LordKalma> just shjowing how much I *dont* understand any of this
[15:58:10] <very_sneaky> i did some reading into it - discovered that for my purposes the optimisations that ninja makes are only relevant for _very_ large code bases
[15:58:24] <very_sneaky> so i just use make unless i run into a reason not to
[15:59:01] <LordKalma> cmake+ninja made building qt6 significantly faster than qt5
[15:59:07] <LordKalma> (according to reports on the mailing list)
[15:59:22] <very_sneaky> qt6 would probably classify as a very large code base
[15:59:29] <LordKalma> a gigantic codebase
[16:00:09] <very_sneaky> but it wasn't an obvious difference if you weren't talking about code bases on the chromium scale
[16:00:27] <LordKalma> qt builds chromium, PLUS the rest of qt :D

[18:51:12] <CarloWood> Poll: Consider a block of // comments that describe a function. Would you,
[18:51:33] <CarloWood> A) put the function definition immediately after the last line.
[18:51:53] <CarloWood> B) put an empty line inbetween the comment block and the function.
[18:52:16] <CarloWood> C) put an empty comment (just '//') in between the comment block and the function.
[18:53:38] <TinoDidriksen> (A) or (C). Never (B) - empty line implies a disconnect.
[18:53:55] <kalven>  A
[18:54:39] <CarloWood> I just went over a few of my files... seems I do all three - rather randomly :(.
[18:54:41] <TinoDidriksen> For docblock comments I do (C), because they're so big that it makes sense. For one-line comments (A) is fine.
[18:55:07] <CarloWood> Yeah - larger blocks only. A single line comment is indeed different.
[18:56:13] <CarloWood> Seems that if the comment in the middle of the file, I use C. But when it is the description of a class and is at the very top of the file, I use B. A only for short comments.
[18:56:22] <CarloWood> comment is*
[18:56:23] <cbreak> A.
[18:56:45] <cbreak>  //! \brief This function does FOOOOOOO
[18:57:35] <cbreak> for multi-line things I use /*! .... */, also directly attached to the function.
[18:57:57] <cbreak> I would not add whitespace between the thing I document and the documentation

[19:00:44] <CarloWood> It's a matter of feeling I guess... but now I think about it - I think that I tend to add an empty line when a comment refers to stuff below it that also includes empty lines.
[19:01:52] <CarloWood> Aka - if there had to be an empty line between `int x;` and `int y;` for some reason, I'd do (five line paste):
[19:01:55] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[19:02:07] <CarloWood> // These two int's are important.
[19:02:10] <CarloWood> -
[19:02:14] <CarloWood> int x;
[19:02:16] <CarloWood> -
[19:02:19] <CarloWood> int y;
[19:02:54] <CarloWood> Because if you'd put that against the `int x;` then the comment would seem to refer only to that first block (`int x;`)...
[19:04:45] <TinoDidriksen> Makes sense
[19:05:03] <CarloWood> And I seem to do C when the comment block also contains an empty comment.
