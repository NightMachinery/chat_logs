[00:05:58] <rbasak> OK so on your system cloud-init is managing your netplan config for you.
[00:06:14] <rbasak> I think it probably has instructions at the top on how to disable it?

[00:07:51] <z1haze> sorry, netplan
[00:08:08] <z1haze> i confused netplan and cloud-init
[00:09:05] <rbasak> What I suggest is that you follow the instructions at the top of /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml to disable cloud-init's configuration of netplan.
[00:09:21] <rbasak> Then rename that file to something else (eg. /etc/netplan/z1haze.yaml), then customize that file as you want it.
[00:09:34] <rbasak> See https://netplan.io/examples/#using-dhcp-and-static-addressing for a static network configuration example.
[00:09:48] <z1haze> nice. thank you
[00:09:49] <rbasak> You can run "sudo netplan apply" to test, though of course if remotely connected you can expect your connection to drop.

[00:13:13] <rbasak> If you name the file lexicographically after 50-cloud-init.yaml (eg. 60-z1haze.yaml) then that should override it anyway.

If I try do something like `sudo apt update`, I get prompted for password, where it is always rejected. I am still part of the `sudo` and `adm` group, The password is a simple password
[13:34:21] <eraserpencil> (because I'm using it in a VM for testing. I know i keyed in the right passwd cause it is simple, and I validated that by getting pass the "current password" prompt when i try to change my password with `passwd` command.

[18:40:06] <tomreyn> it's fully automated (through something called 'dkms'), but this is still not as ideal as when you have hardware where the driver is actually included in the kernel (and thus doesn't need to be builöt seperately).

[21:50:41] <iam8up> i'm running ubuntu 20 and it's just a simple web server right now and my question is can i have it redirect traffic from the public:18080 to another servers private:18080 ?  it doesn't have nat or anything, it would be redirecting the traffic to the default gateway and then it would find the private ip host

[21:54:35] <tomreyn> iam8up: i think iptables can only do port redirects on the same system, ortherwise packets needs to be rewritten, which is no longer the job of a firewall.
[21:55:03] <bundtcake> iam8up: formally you would want to implement a vlan with the router, possibly put the server into a DMZ.
[21:55:06] <iam8up> doesn't iptables do nat and such?  most of my networking is done with mikrotik
[21:55:26] <iam8up> bundtcake, what would a vlan/dmz have to do with this?
