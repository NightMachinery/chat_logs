[04:29:07] <rudybot> dale: in case you live around norway, there's a chicken meeting happening right now (http://wiki.call-cc.org/event/chicken-spring-norway-2014)
[04:29:16] <bpalmer> However, this does get into software maintenance issues; I"m trying to recall which author makes the strong argument that programmers all too often accept arguments because they're elegant, rather than raising errors as defensive programming.
[04:29:23] <dale> OK, we'll stop in 2014 Norway on the way back?
[04:29:56] <bpalmer> the classic example being something like memcpy(dest, src, n); <-- what should the behavior be for n <= 0 ?
[04:30:19] <bremner> nasal demons, obviously
[04:30:51] <dale> bpalmer: n<0 seems like it's error-worthy, n==0 seems fine, but I see your point.
[04:30:53] <bpalmer> Actually, a great point: memcpy's signature is such that n is unsigned, so < 0 is out of scope.
[04:31:13] <dale> Reasonable people could disagree.
[04:31:59] <bpalmer> but the author basically was arguing that if memcpy just raised an error more often, you would in fact catch more bugs (including off by one issues)

[05:59:09] <dale> I understand how to compute things like (mod m n) but then you take something like RSA and I lack the intuition to solve some of the equations.
[05:59:30] <dale> ski: Yes, that is also something I'm a bit hazy on.
[05:59:31] <ski> yea, that `mod' is the programming operation, not the math relation
[06:00:13] <dale> That statement actually confuses me more, but that's OK, I should go read about it and do some problems.

[06:59:46] <ski> johnjaye : "remainder". but it's not as commonly used. there's also "congruence class", which is sortof related. e.g. ⌜[18]₁₃ = {⋯,−34,−21,−8,5,18,31,⋯}⌝. the remainder/residue is an element of the corresponding congruence class (consisting of all the integers whose difference with the number, here ⌜18⌝, is a multiple of the modulus, here ⌜13⌝)
[07:00:31] * ski fonds recalls a (non-native english-speaking) teacher who'd consistently say "reminder" rather than "remainder"
[07:00:43] <johnjaye> yeah i assume CLRS would have been better off just saying a%b instead of a mod b everywhere
[07:01:09] <johnjaye> didn't python do something related with division?
[07:01:23] <johnjaye> / redefined to give a float and if you want integer division like a processor does it's like //
[07:03:11] <ski> usually, math people would just say something like "let ⌜q⌝ and ⌜r⌝ be such that ⌜n = q⋅d + r⌝, where ⌜0 ≤ r < d⌝", and then ⌜r⌝ is the remainder upon division of ⌜n⌝ (numerator/dividend) by ⌜d⌝ (denumerator/divisor) (also ⌜q⌝ is the quotient)
[07:03:48] <johnjaye> for some reason putty is showing my a lot of boxes with that text.
[07:04:10] <johnjaye> i guess you're typing utf-8?
[07:05:26] <ski> there are several distinct ways of choosing a representative (from the congruence class) as a remainder. whichever way you choose, you want ⌜n = q⋅d + r⌝ to hold (division and remainder should be consistent with each other). instead of selecting ⌜0 ≤ r < d⌝ (principal residues) one can e.g. choose ⌜−d∕2 < r ≤ d∕2⌝ (using this, after reducing, one gets to work with slightly less large
[07:05:32] <ski> (in absolute value) numbers)
[07:05:34] <ski> yea
[07:06:12] <ski> (and the processor way in which the sign of the result depends on the sign of the numerator, rather than the sign of the denominator, is just horrible ..)

[10:30:53] <lisp123> bpalmer: not sure to be honest, its a term stuck in my head but maybe I misread it ages ago
[10:31:05] <lisp123> but what I meant was it display text 'by the screen'
[10:31:31] <lisp123> then when you need to look at a part of the buffer below the screen, I think Emacs re-renders the whole screen (shifted one line down)?
[10:32:48] *** Joins: alMalsamo (~alMalsamo@gateway/tor-sasl/almalsamo)
[10:34:11] <ski> yea
[10:34:12] <bpalmer> there are some render time optimizations that some programs do to avoid needing to re-render text as it scrolls on or offscreen; I don't think emacs or vim do anything like that.
[10:34:28] <ski> (most editors that people use, nowadays, are "screenful", or "visual", in this sense)
[10:34:35] <ski> (it's the "v" in "vi")
[10:35:00] <bpalmer> but emacs and vim aren't like web browsers that have sophisticated layout possibilities
[10:35:00] <lisp123> ski: Ah! Yes, now that makes sense in terms of the terminology
[10:35:24] <lisp123> bpalmer: Yeah. So basically Emacs will re-render the whole screen each time?
[10:35:32] <lisp123> (a new line is added)
[10:35:42] <ski> (`ed' and `ex' (`vi' can be run in `ex' mode), as well as `edlin' are well known line editors)
[10:36:44] <ski> if you run (e.g.) `emacs -nw' under GNU Screen, over a slow connection, there's a setting you can toggle in Screen that makes it only update the current line

[20:39:41] <TRS-80> Common-Lisp: My understanding is that the DNS challenge works by setting some text in some DNS record.  So you have to have control of the DNS records for that to work (i.e., own the domain).
[20:40:11] <Common-Lisp> TRS-80: that's fine, but you specifically have to set the record to the value of some token letsencrypt gives you
[20:40:24] <Common-Lisp> and as far as I know, you cannot get that token without an HTTP server running
[20:40:24] <TRS-80> yes
[20:41:07] <TRS-80> not sure about that, but that doesn't seem to make sense as then you might as well just do it the 'normal' http challenge way

Or maybe manually setting it?  At any rate the problem sounds non-trivial, as mentioned by lawlist (who is quite knoledgeable) and has beed discussed on the dev mailing list even.

[22:14:27] <acdw> fontifying just seems complicated i guess lol

[22:14:54] <TRS-80> maybe this is why
[22:15:44] <shrysr> yeah i believe the amount of bleed varies by theme as well. Its less in the modus-themes and iirc properly an eye sore for the leuven theme.
[22:16:06] <acdw> yeah my org-mode headers have backgrounds (modus customization) and when i have a header at the end of a buffer it lights up the buffer after that til i type in it

[22:43:45] <shrysr> I was planning to try contribute to the emacswiki - but - i am a bit confused about Wikemacs versus Emacswiki. Personally, I like emacswiki / oddmuse. However, going through some r/emacs posts - it appeasr wikemacs is not .. abandoned and some pages are more comprehensive than emacswiki.
[22:44:11] <wasamasa> you sure about that?
[22:44:18] <wasamasa> there's still zillions of spam pages on wikemacs

[22:44:42] <wasamasa> this was 2020, mind you
[22:45:06] <acdw> Yeah I thought wikemacs was pretty bleh
[22:45:35] <wasamasa> I pointed it out then and asked someone to notify the maintainer on twitter
[22:45:39] <shrysr> hi wasamasa, yea i saw your post on r/emacs in fact saying the same. and no- i am not sure. So you mean its... 'okay' to focus on Emascwiki ? Maybe port the 'good' pages on Wikemacs to Emacswiki ?

[23:03:12] <TRS-80> Speaking only for myself, I found wikiemacs to be an effort by the sort of people who think that 'modern' is some sort of desirable property of a piece of software (but that I take as a red flag).
