[18:18:28] <acdw> hi circers (witches?) how do i customize how circe opens new windows, on /join, say, or when clicking the trackbar?
[18:18:41] <acdw> I'd like it to just take over the current window instead of splitting

[20:18:49] <FrostyX> acdw: Hello, let me check my config. It opens things in current window
[20:22:33] <acdw> thanks FrostyX :)
[20:23:18] <FrostyX> acdw: I don't have any circe-specific config for that, so I guess maybe this is it? https://github.com/frostyx/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/frostyx.org#window-management
[20:24:30] <acdw> i'll take a look, thanks
[20:25:02] <acdw> i don't have any window stuff setup, so it's about time i try things
[20:25:59] <FrostyX> This https://depp.brause.cc/shackle/ me be worth checking out. 
[20:29:13] <acdw> yeah, that's on my list. it and um, popper.el
[20:29:17] <acdw> ~ one day ~ lol
[20:29:21] <acdw> for now, your config has worked!
[20:30:47] <FrostyX> Ah, glad to hear that. But please be aware that it may change behavior of some other pop-up things. 
[20:31:24] <acdw> sure! i'll cross those bridges when i come to em
[20:31:36] <acdw> hoenstly tho, your write-up is familiar to me. window management is such pain
[20:32:24] <FrostyX> One of the biggest Emacs pain points for me
[20:32:42] <acdw> you can tell b/c there's 500 packages to deal with it
[20:33:25] <FrostyX> If you will remember, let me know which one you settled with :-)
[20:34:14] * FrostyX needs to go afk for now
[20:35:22] <acdw> o/
[20:35:25] <acdw> sure lol

[22:34:18] <euouae> Hello
[22:34:42] <euouae> Is there a feature to encrypt the .pem key/cert files?
[22:35:23] <euouae> weechat has something like this, it allows you to specify the program with which the password file/key file will be accessed, which you use with e.g. gpg to decrypt
[22:36:48] <acdw> i know you can set :sasl-password and :nickserv-password to be functions
[22:37:00] <acdw> so you can write a function that accesses those files, then use that
[22:37:05] <acdw> if tha tmakes sense
[22:37:14] <euouae> nice. What about :tls-keylist?
[22:38:40] <euouae> Looks like the documentation doesn't mention anything about it. Maybe it's time to hack it in :D 
[22:38:50] <acdw> hah
[22:39:01] <acdw> is that in circe-network-options?
[22:39:05] <euouae> yeah 
[22:40:44] <acdw> yeah if you look at `circe-reconnect--internal' (first thing I found it in), for `:sasl-password' it checks if the value is a function and calls it if so
[22:40:53] <acdw> that doesn't happen for `:tls-keylist'
[22:42:29] <euouae> I'm going to try to see if I can do something about that
[22:43:14] <acdw> should be easy enough ... search for :tls-keylist in the circe folder and try replacing the values?
[22:43:56] <euouae> Uhuh
[22:46:17] <acdw> good luck!
[22:56:03] <euouae> acdw: yeah looks like a one-line addition in fact! Now need to modify the docs, that's about it.
[22:56:54] <acdw> hell yeah
[22:57:07] <acdw> just in `circe-reconnect--internal' ?
[22:57:17] <euouae> I beliveve so, yeah acdw 
[22:57:52] <acdw> nice
[23:00:15] <euouae> acdw: Now, what function would I be using to test it out? I want to exec a program that decrypts a file right?
[23:00:54] <euouae> oh oh oh, no, wait. I need some more modifications because I need to store the *contents* of the key file...
[23:01:37] <acdw> hmmm idk, i don't use tls keys sorry
[23:02:16] <euouae> we'll get there, I'll figure it out 
[23:02:45] <acdw> :D good luck
[23:25:44] <euouae> huuuuh I have no idea how it works :(((
[23:27:34] <acdw> aw
[23:28:37] <euouae> I can't track to what point in the source code `tls-keylist` is used. I see it being shoved into a p-list passed into make-tls-process, under tls-parameters I think
[23:29:41] <acdw> oh dang, that might be tricker then
[23:30:05] <euouae> I guess I just can't pinpoint the location in the source code where the .pem file is dealt with

[23:30:34] <euouae> Maybe I can turn on some debug mode and see what functions are called?
