[02:53:33] <matsaman> for example if you just change your browser from wide screen to small screen

[04:02:07] <nbjoerg> if a table with table-layout:auto is overflowing the parent div including triggering a horizontal scrollbar, is it possible to still force it to propagate the size upwards?
[04:02:40] <nbjoerg> i.e. to ensure that siblings of the table will see the same size and padding of the parent is applied?
[04:13:04] <FunkyBob> which siblings would be the same 'size'?
[04:13:24] <FunkyBob> do you want the table to _not_ overflow its container, but the container to grow to contain it?

[05:51:32] <nbjoerg> (1) the padding on the right side of the table is lost [I could live with that part] (2) the white of h4 no longer aligns with the white of the table
[05:51:41] <nbjoerg> (2) is the problem that really annoys me
[05:52:18] <FunkyBob> so you want the H4 and TABLE to always match widths?

[05:56:39] <nbjoerg> moving the scrollbar into the table is not a good UX
[05:56:50] <FunkyBob> ok
[05:56:57] <FunkyBob> but I need to know what y ou _do_ want
[05:56:58] <nbjoerg> especially as it can result in multiple scrollbars
[05:57:27] <nbjoerg> e.g. having a vertical scrollbar on the outside and a second different horizontal one would be just fubar
[05:57:43] <FunkyBob> yes, I understand what that is
[05:57:43] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[05:57:45] <FunkyBob> I still want to know
[05:57:47] <FunkyBob> what you DO want
[05:58:41] <Rockwood> Data Object?
[05:58:41] <nbjoerg> ideally, if the table is overflowing, the width of the parent should be updated and the siblings adjusted to the new width
[06:00:51] <FunkyBob> so you want to prevent overflow... make the parent 'grow' to contain its child
[06:00:57] <FunkyBob> in which case it will overflow _its_ parent
[06:02:26] <nbjoerg> my problem is the half-assed overflow
[06:03:59] <FunkyBob> well, we might be able to help you find another solution, if we knew the actual problem you're trying to solve
[06:04:13] <FunkyBob> the outcome you desire, in a broader scope
[06:04:50] <FunkyBob> the example you've given already has the content at more or less the full size of the viewport
[06:04:55] <FunkyBob> so a scrollback is inevitable
[06:05:00] <nbjoerg> yes
[06:05:08] <nbjoerg> but the scrollbar should be on the outside, not the inside
[06:05:26] <FunkyBob> ...
[06:05:45] <FunkyBob> so your issue is that the scrollbar 'steals' some of the elements own space, instead of stealing it from its parent?
[06:07:09] <nbjoerg> my issue boils down ot the single pass approach used by table-layout:auto not adjusting the width of the siblings after the size of the table has been computed
[06:07:34] <FunkyBob> ... if you say so.
[06:07:48] <FunkyBob> but I still feel  you're focusing too close on this problem
[06:08:27] <FunkyBob> there may be a solution available by changing thigns in a wider scope... but we'd need to know what  that is first
[06:08:39] <FunkyBob> your explanations are focused too much on your solution, not your problem
[06:11:54] <nbjoerg> sure, I can work around things on a larger scope. would have been nice to avoid the whole gotcha in first place
[06:12:14] <FunkyBob> would be nice to know the context proper
[06:13:32] <nbjoerg> context is that I am trying to rebuild the application layout framework from dojo1 in more modern tech and this is one of the cases were alternatives all just suck in different ways :)
[06:13:54] <FunkyBob> ok
[06:14:01] <FunkyBob> dojo... takes me back :P
[06:14:12] <FunkyBob> was more meaning what else was involved in this layout...
[06:14:24] <FunkyBob> or is it truely a h4 + table directly as children of body?
[06:14:35] <FunkyBob> what did Dojo do to solve this? mangling with JS?
[06:15:10] <nbjoerg> ultimately forcing the equivalent of table-layout:fixed
[06:15:25] <FunkyBob> and you can't use that because...?
[06:15:29] <nbjoerg> ...which is one of the limitations I would have loved to see eliminated
[06:16:37] *** Quits: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:18:27] <nbjoerg> e.g. it's annoying having to guess correct column widths in advance ("noone will ever use 6 digit prices!") etc
[06:21:04] <FunkyBob> so... you don't want layout fixed.. ok... but I seem to still be missing something in  the problem scope
[06:21:39] <FunkyBob> (the way we avoid tables overflowing their containers is we have scrollable tables with fixed labels/headers)
[06:22:41] <nbjoerg> I'll likely just table this issue for now and put it in the category of "screws to be you, get a bigger screen" :)

[15:55:39] <copier> oksushi: that's why i'm doing it gridwise
[15:55:49] <copier> so i can get those three header/main/footer there
[15:55:53] <copier> and then flexbox will figure the rest out
[15:55:55] <copier> :^)

[18:30:41] <Bilge> How can you have a header text element set the width of its container but have following paragraph elements respect that header width instead of also expanding the container?
[18:31:26] <Bilge> i.e. the header text (automatically) sets the width of the following paragraphs such that the paragraphs do not grow larger thant he width of the header text

[22:54:30] <Bilge> The first <p>
[22:54:53] <hassoon> i don't get it
[22:54:58] <hassoon> what do you want to do with it
[22:55:07] <hassoon> set its width ?
[22:55:39] <Bilge> The heading sets the width
[22:55:57] <Bilge> That is, the container becomes the width of the heading and no bigger
[22:56:47] <Bilge> The container currently expands based on the content of either the heading or the following paragraph, but it should only consider the heading and not the following paragraph in sizing itself
[22:59:07] <hassoon> Bilge: what if the paragraph is longer than the heading
[23:00:29] *** Joins: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios)
[23:01:33] <Bilge> Then it will wrap at the width of the header
[23:01:56] <hassoon> Bilge: the container needs to have a specific width
[23:02:04] <Bilge> Yeah that's not a solution is it
[23:02:56] <hassoon> Bilge: css cannot tell the container to have the width of that of the header, unless you do that with javacript
[23:03:12] <Bilge> Because (1) the header text is variable length and (2) even if it were not, the width would have to exactly match the heading text which is impossible to know ahead of time just based on variables beyond our control such as system differences in font rendering and UA overrides
[23:03:45] <Bilge> That's fine, if it's not possible it's not possible

[23:05:04] <hassoon> Bilge: otherwise, the container must have one sole child, which is your heading
[23:05:13] <hassoon> Bilge: then give the cotnainer width:fit-contents
[23:05:23] <hassoon> *content
[23:09:03] <hassoon> https://codepen.io/hassoon/pen/KKXBrXe?editors=1100
[23:12:26] <Bilge> That doesn't have anything to do with what I want
[23:12:59] <Bilge> The content pagraph must follow the width of the heading
[23:13:06] <Bilge> Is it still not clear?
[23:13:15] <hassoon> you cannot tell the container to take the width of a specific child amongother children that it contains
[23:13:20] <hassoon> unless you do it in javascript
[23:13:35] <hassoon> that too
