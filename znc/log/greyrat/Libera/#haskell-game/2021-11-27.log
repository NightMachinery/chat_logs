[06:09:07] <EvanR> hey
[06:09:08] *** Joins: thekyriarchy (~thekyriar@2001:470:69fc:105::493)
[06:09:18] <EvanR> is there something like this but for haskell https://arewegameyet.rs/
[06:21:21] <f-a> no, but we do not have entire mod teams resigning en masse or other drama too
[06:21:26] <f-a> so on balance, I choose haskell
[06:22:59] <f-a> (it is a very good resource for real)
[06:39:41] <sm> make it EvanR !
[06:40:59] <EvanR> rust drama? lol
[06:41:54] <EvanR> maybe the intersection of people willing to put together a slick web2.0 site 
[06:42:06] <EvanR> and people doing haskell is approaching empty set
[06:42:23] <EvanR> I surely don't know what would go on such a page anyway
[06:47:34] <EvanR> wait

[17:50:47] <icrbow[m]> <EvanR> "I surely don't know what would..." <- BTW, if you'll have ideas on it, ping me. I want to do a little upgrade (to the emanote) and put out a few more stories.
[17:53:59] <f-a> excellent site
[17:58:24] <ManofLetters[m]> the best

[20:13:24] <f-a> 7 days FOSS game jam, right size to produce something (at least, it worked for me)
