[08:00:24] <CoJaBo_> I don't suppose there's a way to force an application to use a default cursor, is there? Mainly I need to have a non-microscopic cursor in VNC client, and apparently none of them actually provide such a feature built-in :/

[08:01:50] <JollyRgrs> doesn't it let you use your local cursor over VNC?
[08:02:28] <JollyRgrs> or is the issue your own cursor is the microscopic one?
[08:02:49] <JollyRgrs> it's ok, my wife says i need to have a non-microscopic something... i think she said cursor... let me know if you find the solution
[08:03:14] <CoJaBo_> JollyRgrs: The only option for local cursor in EVERY client I can find is to have a tiny mostly-transparent dot
[08:03:35] <CoJaBo_> This is completely not visible on a 4k screen
[08:04:42] <JollyRgrs> that's what SHE SAID!
[08:04:54] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[08:05:26] <JollyRgrs> srsly though, i remember seeing both that dot and the local cursor at the same time and playing with the delays
[08:05:35] <JollyRgrs> so gotta be there somewhere
[08:06:23] <CoJaBo_> The server doesn't have remote cursor enabled, and it would be far too laggy even if it did
