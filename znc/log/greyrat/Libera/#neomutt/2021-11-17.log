[12:02:00] <_hades> ok thxs!

[12:19:53] <Guest25> I am using Neomutt with Gmail (Workspace). When I move a message from the inbox to a different folder, it appears to succeed. The next time I launch mutt, however, the message is still in the inbox. It has two labels, one for Inbox and another for the target mailbox. The move operation is using the default save-message. Any ideas?
[12:22:45] <gahr> I don't have a gmail workspace account to test sorry, just a regular gmail one.. and save-message works as expected there..
[12:23:42] <gahr> is it possible that gmail workspace's inbox is a kind of "All Mail" container with everything inside, labeled by "folder"?
[12:24:56] <Guest25> I think it works the same as Workspace, just wanted to mention it if it makes a difference.
[12:26:02] <Guest25> The Inbox is, as I understand it, different from All Mail. Basically, removing the Inbox label takes out of of the inbox, but it's still in All Mail.
[12:26:31] <Guest25> And in Gmail, in general, a message can be in multiple folders, folders are just labels.
[12:27:36] <Guest25> This problem has been going on for a few months, but I don't think it was always there. 
[12:27:44] <Guest25> Deleting mails works fine, they are gone forever
[12:27:59] <Guest25> Or rather, they are still in All Mail, but they don't come back to the inbox
[12:28:31] <Guest25> And it doesn't seem to happen all the time, it might be e.g. related to the session timing out and thus not getting "flushed". 
[12:29:52] <Guest25> I generally use mutt for initial triage, then run an external script if I want to open a message in the Gmail web interface, e.g. because it has complex html formatting.
[12:30:09] <Guest25> So maybe there is some issue of having two sessions open on the same mailbox.
[12:30:18] <Guest25> One from the web and one from mutt
[12:34:23] <gahr> does the mail get marked as deleted in Inbox when you save it?
[12:36:22] <Guest25> In mutt,  after moving the message, it shows as being deleted from the inbox, same as any other deleted mail. But the Inbox label is still on the message. If I load it in the Gmail web interface, I can see two labels. If I remove the Inbox label, then it disappears from the inbox. 
[13:11:24] <gahr> what happens if you sync-mailbox in mutt?
[13:11:30] <gahr> it should just disappear from inbox
[13:24:50] <Guest25> Yes, sync-mailbox works. It says "Purge 2 deleted messages? yes/no" and does it.
[13:25:03] <Guest25> "Expunging from server"
[13:26:13] <Guest25> But then when I come back in, the message is back. It has the Label for "Inbox" on it still.
[13:26:25] <Guest25> In addition to where I moved it.
[13:27:08] <Guest25> I am a programmer, so I am happy to do whatever is needed to debug. I am currently installing from Homebrew on mac. 
[13:34:19] <gahr> you can run with neomutt -d5, it captures logs into ~/.neomuttdebug0
[13:34:24] <gahr> you can inspect the IMAP session
[13:36:03] <gahr> and see what gmail replies to the UID COPY and EXPUNGE commands
[13:36:11] <gahr> examples
[13:36:12] <gahr>  [2021-11-17 10:04:46]<2> mutt_socket_write_d() 4> b0020 UID COPY 4548 "[Gmail]/Starred"
[13:36:18] <gahr> [2021-11-17 10:04:46]<5> mutt_socket_readln_d() 4< b0020 OK [COPYUID 596386032 4548 88] (Success)
[13:36:34] <gahr> [2021-11-17 10:04:48]<2> mutt_socket_write_d() 4> b0021 UID STORE 4548 +FLAGS.SILENT (\Deleted)
[13:36:49] <gahr> b0022 EXPUNGE
[13:37:03] <gahr> etc..
[13:38:30] <gahr> mh.. so you way expunging works, but the next time you fire up mutt, it's still there
[13:38:45] <gahr> (btw, are you on neomutt or plain mutt?)
[13:39:07] <gahr> oh alright, you said neomutt already
[13:40:00] <gahr> perhaps something else is bringing the email back into theinbox
[13:40:04] <Guest25> "NeoMutt 20210205"
[13:40:09] <gahr> does this happen for other folders too?
[13:40:16] <gahr> like, if you move from Sent to Starred or something
[13:40:34] <gahr> can you try a newer version?
[13:40:49] <gahr> from github / master would be best:)

[18:25:22] <flatcap> :-)
[18:25:24] <gahr> coverity/mutt_file_seek
[18:26:00] <flatcap> good, the action has kicked in: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/actions/workflows/coverity.yml
[18:26:21] <gahr> nice
[18:26:24] <flatcap> (documentation coming soon)
[18:26:43] <gahr> in docbook format?
[18:26:45] <gahr> :D
[18:27:42] <flatcap> markdown, if you're lucky :-)
[18:29:08] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[18:29:11] <flatcap> most of these seem straightforward -- they already have error paths
[18:30:11] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@201.192.183.100) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[18:30:56] <gahr> yep
[18:31:44] <gahr> I still see     Nov 15, 2021 as last analysed on coverity
[18:32:56] <flatcap> above, you should see "Last Build Status: Running. Your build is currently being analyzed"
[18:34:20] <gahr> right
[18:37:13] <ckardaris> p
[18:37:46] <flatcap> q
[18:38:29] <ckardaris> what's the keyboard equivalent of a pocket dial? :P
[18:39:54] <flatcap> :-)
[18:43:03] <flatcap> 8 fewer lines (4 fewer defects) - https://gist.github.com/flatcap/74aacb29df42a4722c259349902fdec3
[18:58:53] <gahr> small steps :)
[19:02:07] <flatcap> there are two changes in mbox/mbox.c that may need tweaking...
[19:02:31] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/d547063207007f38d7f2d0e3997fcb8f9a6c90bf#diff-78b00f3d62ade759ae2624530dcf9bcfff597476dfaa8d7f49d6000fad88b239R1092
[19:02:33] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/d547063207007f38d7f2d0e3997fcb8f9a6c90bf#diff-78b00f3d62ade759ae2624530dcf9bcfff597476dfaa8d7f49d6000fad88b239R1101
[19:03:04] <flatcap> above, we call mutt_sig_block() and mbox_lock_mailbox()
[19:03:39] <flatcap> but don't mutt_sig_unblock() or mbox_unlock_mailbox()
[19:03:42] <gahr> nice one
[19:04:03] <flatcap> but the rest look good
[19:09:01] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/4e9f92fdf
[19:11:26] <gahr> ouch I should go back to the previous branch or coverity will keep analysing
[19:11:49] <flatcap> ah, coverity will analyse that too :-)
[19:11:57] <flatcap> you can kill the job from the actions page
[19:12:22] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[19:12:29] <gahr> ok we don't have a limited number of runs?
[19:12:42] <flatcap> three per day
[19:13:20] <gahr> I'll push sparsely
[19:17:04] <flatcap> or if you commit with "[ci skip]" in the message, it should skip the actions
[19:30:59] <gahr> thanks
