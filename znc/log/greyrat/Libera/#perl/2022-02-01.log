[03:32:52] <FlorianBad> It seems that I am getting different return values depending where I execute system() from. For example for:   my $gzip_cmd = system("pigz -V >/dev/null 2>&1") == 0 ? "pigz" : "gzip";
[03:33:28] <FlorianBad> when I type that with perl -e ...  in an ssh terminal remotely I get 0, but when it's executed in a console on the local machine it looks like it returns -1
[03:33:59] <FlorianBad> how is that possible?
[03:34:09] <LeoNerd> is the pigz program accessible?
[03:35:06] <FlorianBad> yes it's not about pigz, it's the return value, when I use any other command it's the same thing, success seem to be -1 instead of 0 once it's local in the perl.pl rather than remote ssh with perl -e

[03:45:02] <FlorianBad> ah, well, I did not realize that system() actually forks! so that might explain... Not sure how to get around this though
[03:45:55] <rewt> what does `perldoc -f system` say about its return value?
[03:46:39] <leont> The effect of «$SIG{CHLD} = "IGNORE";» depends on your platform
[03:47:20] <leont> That can cause children to be auto-reaped, hence causing wait to return an error

[03:55:12] <FlorianBad> can I make a catch sub for $SIG{CHLD} and then figure out a way for it to return what it should for system() but to ignore when it's one of my forks?
[03:56:21] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[03:56:38] <FlorianBad> Or I can also set $SIG{CHLD} right before my fork() and also right before system() ?  Would that work?
[03:58:50] <rewt> you can disable it until system() returns, something like:  my $rc = do { local $SIG{CHLD}; system('...') };
[03:59:56] <FlorianBad> What about simply   $SIG{CHLD} = "DEFAULT"; just before I call system?  And then  $SIG{CHLD} = "IGNORE" just before I call fork?
[04:01:15] <rewt> because then there's more to maintain, if you add another fork() somewhere, you have to remember to set it there as well, etc
[04:01:31] <leont> You want to block is using sigprocmask during the system call
[04:01:36] <rewt> might as well just temp reset it in a scope you need, and not worry about it
[04:01:59] <FlorianBad> ok I see'
[04:02:06] <leont> My Signal::Mask module is the user-friendly way to do is, but using POSIX for it isn't too hard either

[04:05:07] <rewt> `perldoc perlvar` says: Using an empty string or "undef" as the value has the same effect as 'DEFAULT'.

[20:08:04] <Grinnz> nope, hashref or hash has the same issue

[20:16:01] <Moonlight> What's brackiin, y'all?
[20:16:07] <Grinnz> perl's numification recognizes perl's stringification of numbers, yes
[20:16:11] <Grinnz> oct is not a numification
[20:16:27] <Grinnz> not the normal kind, anyway

[20:17:35] <Altreus> not what I'm saying

[20:18:20] <Grinnz> it's not
[20:18:28] <Grinnz> you gave it a string that is only partially octal
[20:18:35] <Altreus> I don't think you're understanding my point
[20:18:49] <Altreus> oct behaves like string eval for strings starting with 0x and 0b
[20:19:17] <Grinnz> yes, without a prefix it falls back to interpreting it as octal, hence the name
[20:19:20] <Altreus> right

[20:19:30] *** Quits: otisolsen70_ (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:19:50] <Altreus> Because oct plays at string eval but doesn't even cover all of the options
[20:20:05] <Altreus> if it can detect 0x or 0b then surely it can detect e
[20:20:07] <Grinnz> what else should it do?
[20:20:16] <Grinnz> e is not octal, hex, or binary
[20:20:31] <Altreus> why does it do hex or binary at all?

[20:22:07] <Grinnz> no idea
[20:22:13] <Grinnz> well
[20:22:15] <tm604> because b is a valid hex digit
[20:22:18] <Grinnz> yeah, that
[20:22:39] <Altreus> Are we so starved of character strings that we couldn't just make a function that parses a number?
[20:22:50] <Grinnz> "parses a number"?
[20:22:55] <Grinnz> all values are numbers
[20:23:24] <Altreus> I'm still talking about strings that Perl recognises as numeric literals
[20:23:39] <Grinnz> if it's not a decimal string, you use oct or hex to turn it into one
[20:23:39] <Moonlight> is there effectively any difference between octal, hex, and bbinary data aside from man-readable interpretations
[20:23:56] <Altreus> then why's there no bin
[20:23:57] <Grinnz> you should probably not have strings which you aren't sure are octal or not
[20:24:04] <Altreus> Then oct should not need to do this
[20:24:05] <Grinnz> because nobody cared enough
[20:24:09] <Moonlight> because whho'd want that?
[20:24:18] <Moonlight> hex is way easier
[20:24:21] <tm604> if only Perl had a function for parsing integers from strings... we could call it parseInt(), perhaps
[20:24:28] <Altreus> what if it's not an integer
[20:24:34] <tm604> could even take a second parameter with the desired radix
[20:24:54] <tm604> if it's not an integer, grind it through regex until it is
[20:25:03] <Altreus> I don't really see why you can't have fractions in octal or hexadecimal
[20:25:07] <Moonlight> classic perl response
[20:25:15] <Moonlight> "fatass regex"
[20:25:25] <Altreus> So not only is oct doing hex and bin for no reason, they all assume it's an integer even though we already have int for that

[21:20:40] <green-> I'd like to, in a loop, replace a token in a string, while preserving the original string so the token replacement can be performed on the next iteration. e.g.  $string = "This is [[FOO]]"; ... replace [[FOO]] each time with something new determined by the loop
[21:21:15] <Altreus> my $new_string = $string =~ s/TOKEN/$loop_variable/gr

[21:21:21] <Altreus> the r is the important bit
[21:21:38] <green-> Altreus: in that example, $string remains unmodified?
[21:21:43] <Altreus> correct
[21:22:04] <green-> Altreus: perfect. thank you. I assumed this was a simple/borderline stupid question, but it proved a difficult thing to Google. ;)
[21:22:13] <Grinnz> /r is supported since 5.14 and substitutes in a copy instead of the original string, and returns it
[21:22:30] <Grinnz> you can also do it yourself: (my $new_string = $string) =~ s///g
[21:22:40] <green-> Grinnz: well that will work nicely then. 
[21:22:42] <Grinnz> this does the copy assignment first, then the substitution

[22:27:52] <ozzzo_work> I'm having a problem with my script. It uses 2 levels of parallelism. In the first level I create a bunch of VMs and test them. In the 2nd level I perform ping, rDNS and fDNS tests at the same time. The problem is, when forward or reverse DNS fails, the other task (forward or reverse) blocks until the failed one times out. For example, in this
[22:27:53] <ozzzo_work> output, stackwatch-trust-4 is finishing in a few seconds, but it blocks until the failed ones time out:

[22:34:33] <Grinnz> yes. if you want async things in parallel, they must use the same loop
[22:34:37] <Grinnz> otherwise one will block the other
[22:34:54] <Grinnz> unless that's what you want. not quite clear
[22:35:40] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[22:35:59] <Grinnz> also, you shouldn't individually ->get your futures. use a combination future like Future->wait_all or Future->needs_all (Depending what you want to happen if one fails)
[22:36:48] <Grinnz> oh your second level is in the IO::Async::Function child process, so you're corect, it needs its own loop
[22:37:39] <Grinnz> so yeah, i think it's just that you're individually ->get instead of combining your futures so they can complete when they're done, rather than being blocked by each other

[22:47:02] <vague> Well... since he wasn't supposed to use ->get? :)
[22:47:29] <Grinnz> you still can use ->get (and probably should, that's the easiest way to deal with futures)
[22:47:35] <Grinnz> just on the combined future, not the individual ones
[22:48:29] <vague> Ok. I really should read up more on futures but I don't use them in my code I don't feel motivated
[22:48:50] <Grinnz> you can either add a ->then to each future to handle its results before you combine them (->then returns a new future)
[22:49:07] *** Quits: Sauvin (~sauvin@about/linux/staff/sauvin) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:49:08] <Grinnz> or you can deal with the results after everything's done, when the combined ->get returns
[22:49:10] <Grinnz> or both
[22:49:48] <zgu> if you're doing anything with Device::Chip and it's not working just make sure there's a ->get at the end of every line :P

[22:49:59] <Grinnz> futures are very much a case where once you start playing with it and understand the basics, everything else just kind of makes sense
[22:50:08] <Grinnz> but before that a-ha moment it's very weird
[22:51:00] <Grinnz> also this stuff with ->get is only because there isn't an event loop running in the child process here. in a daemon where the loop is running persistently in that process, you would instead attach ->then and let things complete when they complete
[22:51:30] <Grinnz> using ->then to attach whatever followup may depend on it
[22:56:53] <simcop2387> rust's borrow checker is very much like that too.  combine that with futures there and there's another moment too.

[23:30:49] <Grinnz> sure, but keep in mind the results of a wait_all are the futures themselves, because unlike needs_all it will return successful *or* failed futures
[23:31:22] <Grinnz> so you have to check each one whehter it succeeded (which you cuold do by calling ->result on it, that will throw an exception if failed... or you could check is_failed, or whatever you feel like)
[23:31:41] <ozzzo_work> ok i'll try it, ty!
[23:32:04] <Grinnz> needs_all on the other hand will immediately fail the overall future if any individual one fails, which may or may not be what you want. but its results will just be the successful results of each future directly

[23:38:16] <ozzzo_work> beautiful! I'm starting to get a glimmer of understanding how this whole Future thing works
[23:39:01] <Grinnz> you can also do handling by attaching ->then to the individual futures, and putting the future reutrned by ->then in the wait_all instead
[23:39:15] <Grinnz> if you want handling to happen as soon as that individual thing finishes, instead of when everything finishes
