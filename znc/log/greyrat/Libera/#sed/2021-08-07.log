[02:46:21] <bomb-on> hi all! i'm trying to find a specific block in a file and replace a string within that block and save it in the same file.
[02:46:33] <bomb-on> i'm not completely sure if sed is a good tool to achieve that
[02:46:36] *** Joins: Torr (~Torr@user/torr)
[02:46:48] <bomb-on> but so far, i managed to find my block of text with something like:
[02:46:56] <bomb-on> sed -n "/^Host test-$env$/,/^$/p" .ssh/config
[02:47:35] <bomb-on> i wonder if it is possible to replace part of found text and save it "inline" in the same time?
[02:47:59] <earnestly> Consider designing your ssh config to use includes so that you can manage these things as individual snippets
[02:48:11] <earnestly> E.g. Include config.d/*
[02:48:18] <bomb-on> oh? includes?
[02:48:45] <earnestly> See `man ssh_config'
[02:48:46] <bomb-on> that's a new to me, but that might easily solve my problem here
[02:49:02] <earnestly> It seems like it
[02:49:23] <bomb-on> alright i see it, well, thanks a lot for a quick help ;)
[02:49:31] <earnestly> I have per-host configs under config.d which are included by the main ssh/config
[02:51:03] <bomb-on> awesome! too bad i didn't find out about that before, would organize this mess here much earlier :)
[02:51:52] <bomb-on> earnestly but can you tell if it would be possible to do something like what i asked?
[02:52:07] <earnestly> And fwiw, using "$env" in sed like that is potential code injection
[02:52:28] <bomb-on> hm, how so?
[02:52:45] <earnestly> Because you're expanding arbitrary strings in the context of sed's language
[02:53:14] <earnestly> E.g. $env could contain regex and that regex will be evaluated by sed
[02:53:29] <bomb-on> that means that any var is "dangerous", not "env" per se?
[02:53:32] <earnestly> So you're exposing yourself to code injection
[02:53:47] <earnestly> bomb-on: Depends where the variable is expanded
[02:54:13] <bomb-on> i mean, you're not referring to var's name (env) but just any var within sed?
[02:54:13] <earnestly> bomb-on: Consider the difference between: awk -v var="$var" 'var' vs. awk "$var"
[02:54:47] <bomb-on> uh, i'm not really sure what's the difference, would have to try it out
[02:54:49] <earnestly> I'm not sure why this is difficult to grasp
[02:54:58] <bomb-on> it's not difficult =)
[02:55:03] <earnestly> You're expanding a variable inside the execution context of another command
[02:55:19] <earnestly> That variable could expand to code which is evaluated because of that context
[02:55:38] <bomb-on> i'm aware of potential danger here, just wasn't sure if you wanted to point out var with the specific name for any reason :)
[02:56:09] <bomb-on> i understand it, don't worry
[02:56:12] <earnestly> bomb-on: var='rm -rf *'; sh -c "echo $var" vs. sh -c 'echo $1' _ "$var"
[02:56:14] <bomb-on> and thanks for pointing it out
[02:56:37] <bomb-on> hey i'm not doing that :Þ
[02:56:42] <earnestly> You are with that sed
[02:57:12] <bomb-on> i understand it, really, but again, thanks for pointing it out, i appreciate it
[02:57:40] <earnestly> So basically while sed can probably do this, I wouldn't use it, and use awk instead
[02:57:47] <bomb-on> this is strictly for personal usage and $env is just a helper to automate my everyday's work
[02:58:05] <earnestly> There's no need to expose code injection under any circumstance
[02:58:13] <earnestly> personal or otherwise, just no point
[02:58:17] <bomb-on> i know and you're right
[02:58:33] <bomb-on> can i then ask how would you handle such case?
[03:01:21] <earnestly> awk -v env="$env" '$1 == "Host" && $2 == "test-" env {b=1} b && /string to match/ {print "replacement string"} $1 == "Host" {b=0} 1' # or so
[03:02:23] <bomb-on> oh ok, amazing
[03:02:31] <bomb-on> didn't expect so much effort, thanks a lot!
[03:02:33] <earnestly> The conditions for when to set or reset the "in block" sentinel probably need to be refined, ssh_config suggests Host (and Match) are blocks until another "Host" is found
[03:03:14] <earnestly> Hm
[03:05:15] <bomb-on> ah yea i see
[03:06:10] <earnestly> But don't do this sort of anything, fix ssh/config instead to use includes
[03:06:17] <earnestly> anything/thing
[03:08:20] <earnestly> I wouldn't be surprised if there was a proper standalone parser you could use if you really must
[03:09:17] <earnestly> Match can literally execute commands that can use the exit status to determine if it should include the remaining block lol
[03:20:17] <bomb-on> yea i will definitely go with includes, was looking around for some tool which would help me with modifying ssh config entries but couldn't find anything useful
[03:20:28] <bomb-on> shell tool that is...
