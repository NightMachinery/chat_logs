[13:12:44] <Gaboradon> I'm wondering if WDIDLE3.exe WD5741.exe and idle3tools are still relevant for WD RED Plus drives, I heard that the newer drives have the idle timer set to 300 and I think I remember now that indeed is true a few years back I checked.

[13:14:41] <Gaboradon> I was thinking I need to do this, but now I'm recalling my memory I don't actually have to, because there's some mixing information whether idle3tools (linux) does everything the official wdidle3.exe DOS utility does,  hdparm (linux) also has a "wdidle3.c" file and has this function but uses less code than idle3tools seems like their own implementation and in the code they say the function is dangerous and that the official DOS

[19:28:20] <ThePendulum> lego says the titanic is "temporarily" out of stock... wonder if it's permanent :(

[19:30:52] <NeoThermic> nah
[19:31:04] <NeoThermic> permanent means: we're no longer going to make this
[19:31:17] <NeoThermic> considering they just released it, it's got another 17-23 months of shelf life
[19:31:35] <ThePendulum> still not sure if I want it or not, I'd probably keep it in a box until I move out
[19:31:59] <NeoThermic> I'd say get it if you want it, build it if you have the space for it :D
[19:33:03] <ThePendulum> guess this set is unlikely to lose value, so if I do regret it I could still sell it, especially if it's in the box

[19:33:24] <NeoThermic> 100% for sure, once it is no longer made the price typically goes up for BNIB
[19:33:50] <NeoThermic> "Once retired, the expected annual growth will be close to 10% after the second year, which will value the set bewteen £589 and £654 shortly after it is retired."
[19:34:03] <ThePendulum> they say it's a better investment than gold, lol
[19:34:08] <NeoThermic> they're not wrong
[19:37:26] <ThePendulum> I signed up for the stock notification, hopefully it doesn't sell out within minutes when it comes back

[23:49:50] <ThePendulum> ordered a USB stick that was in stock, not in stock. they tried to sell me a cheaper one. looked at the tweakers.com reviews, apparently they've been doing that for that exact USB stick at least a month, and other products for years
[23:50:08] <ThePendulum> they recommend it as being equivalent while it has half the read speed

[23:50:43] <ThePendulum> lol the message I got from them too. Dear ThePunedumul, Tankh you for your message.
[23:50:59] <ThePendulum> looks like they have to write a lot of those on a day
[23:53:43] <joepie91> ThePendulum: never heard of them. I always order flash storage at Opus
[23:53:55] <joepie91> strong recommendation
[23:54:40] <joepie91> they pretty much exactly do what they promise, and in the rare case that something is wrong, they've always sorted it out within a day
[23:54:57] <ThePendulum> they were the cheapest on tweakers and somehow had a 4,5/5 rating, didn't think much of it
[23:55:00] <ThePendulum> these guys? https://opus.nl/
[23:55:04] <joepie91> yeah
[23:55:17] <joepie91> they've been around for literally over a decade lol
[23:55:23] <ThePendulum> oh I accidentally typed "opus usb stock" that's why they were 20 results down lol
[23:55:39] <joepie91> they were originally one of those "cheap blank CDs/DVDs through German import" shops
[23:55:50] <joepie91> and have somehow managed to survive
[23:56:12] <joepie91> the service was great a decade ago and it's still great today, so that may be why :p
[23:56:36] <joepie91> also the outlet category is worth having a glance at
[23:56:58] <joepie91> there's often genuinely cheap stuff in there
[23:59:33] <ThePendulum> nice, hm not sure how to feel about MediaRange sd cards though
