[10:05:26] <Hunterkll> this was apple follows standard terms everyone else does deal 
[10:05:46] <Hunterkll> and netflix follows the same terms, hence they pay a higher rate
[10:05:57] <catbeard> apple sucks on goldman's sack
[10:06:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so? as per the artical its what the union is alleging
[10:06:24] <Hunterkll> the union isn't alleging anything other then that they want to renegotiate a bit with the union rates 
[10:06:25] <sd> 11<H​otmess> i dont really care what they are paying relative to Y thats the unions problem
[10:06:30] <sd> 11<H​otmess> `Apple claimed its TV+ service had less than 20 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada as of July, allowing it to pay behind-the-scenes production crew lower rates than streamers with more subscriptions, according to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a union that represents TV and movie workers who perform jobs like operating cameras and building sets.`
[10:06:40] <Hunterkll> sure
[10:06:44] <Hunterkll> that's not alleging anything
[10:06:46] <Hunterkll> that's just facts 
[10:06:48] <Hunterkll> But union leaders argue that streaming is no longer a particularly new form of media, and companies that bankroll streaming productions should pay rates closer to traditional media productions.
[10:06:52] <Hunterkll> That is the important part

[10:15:24] <Hunterkll> but amazon's only in the single digit billions territory for production spend - netflix is in the double digit billions club and soon to be past 20 billion

[17:43:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> `NUMA topology in Hyper-V virtual machines
[17:43:42] <sd> 11<H​otmess> When a virtual machine is started, Hyper-V attempts to allocate all the memory for that virtual machine from a single physical NUMA node, if sufficient memory is available. If the memory requirements for the virtual machine cannot be satisfied from a single node, Hyper-V allocates memory from another physical NUMA node. This is known as NUMA spanning. For more information about NUMA Spanning, see the Host settings – NUMA Spanning section later i
[17:43:42] <A-KO> yeah client hyper-v stuff is a bit different
[17:43:46] <A-KO> uses a different cpu-scheduler too
[17:43:46] <csws> other than it replaces ATA and the UI looks almost exactly the same
[17:44:06] <Hunterkll> csws: doesn't exactly replace ATA depending on use case 
[17:44:09] <Hunterkll> that's the unfortunate part
[17:44:21] <Hunterkll> like if you're port mirroring all traffic, etc 
[17:44:24] <csws> oh
[17:44:24] <sd> 11<H​otmess> from what i can tell its to do with numa spanning
[17:44:28] <Hunterkll> it's similar but not functionally the same 
[17:44:28] <csws> but if you're using the agent it's the same experience
[17:44:31] <sd> 11<H​otmess> hyper-v is weird
[17:44:37] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess actually, it just defaults to 50% of your core count on Win11
[17:44:40] <Hunterkll> has nothing to do with Numa 
[17:44:47] <Hunterkll> numa spanning is the default on almost any hypervisor
[17:44:49] <Hunterkll> unless you force-kill it 
[17:45:10] <Hunterkll> on my system it creates new VMs with 18 vCPUs lol 
[17:45:18] <Hunterkll> which, just like A-KO's, is a single socket, non-NUMA system
[17:45:22] <A-KO> it's 1/2 the thread/logical processor count
[17:45:28] <A-KO> single socket, 12 cores, 24 threads
[17:46:54] <A-KO> I should max out my ram
[17:46:56] <A-KO> lol

[17:55:27] <PublicWiFi> yeah I bet they had an outdated one
[17:55:31] <csws> man that was ages ago
[17:55:34] <PublicWiFi> maybe not but this company is smol
[17:55:37] <PublicWiFi> 1 year
[17:55:43] <csws> december iirc
[17:55:57] <csws> and people were mass scanning in early jan
[17:56:00] <csws> would be surprising if it bit this late
[17:56:24] <csws> then again travelex got owned by a pulse vuln from like 6 months prior to their attack
[17:56:49] <csws> which they patched insanely late and ultimately the attackers were already well and truly in the network by then
[17:57:12] <PublicWiFi> yeah maybe you're right

[17:57:23] <PublicWiFi> this  company literally plugged the plug on their whole environment lol

[17:57:38] <csws> it could be literally anything lol
[17:57:43] <PublicWiFi> so 6 days without prod is killing us lol
[17:57:47] <PublicWiFi> csws: thats so damn true lol
[17:57:47] <csws> I mean maybe they had an out of date exchange exposed to the net
[17:58:02] <PublicWiFi> only thing they have external facing really is the citirx appliances but you never know, someone could have clicked on an email
[17:58:25] <PublicWiFi> I mean they practice DOPE sec with the product we use, 2 admins have to join together to combine their OTP passwords to access shit and everything lo
[17:58:29] <csws> usually a pretty good way to discover exchange boxes is to look at the SPF record
[17:58:34] <PublicWiFi> but maybe their actual sec with their actual environment was shit

[17:58:46] <PublicWiFi> good idea lol

[17:59:39] <PublicWiFi> too bad we never set that up lol
[17:59:44] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: yeah I know
[17:59:56] <csws> then again I worked for a joint that got 25% of their revenue through one shitty application
[18:00:00] <csws> but at least we hosted that on prem
[18:00:04] <PublicWiFi> we're considering pulling the app back in-house, the cost is a little less but ofc we have server maint and offline backup costs with that
[18:00:14] <PublicWiFi> our market is so niche
[18:00:23] <PublicWiFi> this is basically the only software we can use rn lo
[18:00:34] <PublicWiFi> and te company offered a discount to move it to theeri servers, basically paid the same price as oon-prem

[18:07:27] <PublicWiFi> its funny and sad
[18:07:30] <sintax> its only revenue. what else you gonna miss
[18:07:50] <PublicWiFi> its funny cause we give OUR clients an SLA
[18:07:57] <PublicWiFi> and we're breaking it for literally 100% of them atm
[18:07:59] <int0x1C8> so PublicWiFi got hacked and their app has been down for 6 days?
[18:08:07] <PublicWiFi> not us, our SaaS vendor
[18:08:14] <PublicWiFi> which houses our core software
[18:08:32] <int0x1C8> ah
[18:08:47] <PublicWiFi> i liked anonymoose's idea of building a custom dynamics app to do this instead of this shitty software
[18:08:51] <PublicWiFi> but the costs are too great
[18:09:04] <sintax> maybe not after 6 days of lost revenue
[18:09:09] <PublicWiFi> ^
[18:09:30] <PublicWiFi> the app is honestly kind of "simple" on paper
[18:09:43] <PublicWiFi> its got a giant SQL database and its just a data entry app

[18:10:12] <sintax> study up and do it. 
[18:10:15] <PublicWiFi> imagine making the new app compatible with existing databases from the old one, damn I could retire early
[18:10:25] <sintax> maybe
[18:10:35] <PublicWiFi> export db, import to new app, profit
[18:10:39] <sintax> usually i've seen contracts employees sign that anything you create while working there belogs to the company
[18:10:46] <PublicWiFi> not me
[18:10:50] <sintax> perfect
[18:10:51] <PublicWiFi> and i'd work on it at home ;D

[18:11:00] <PublicWiFi> gotta learn how to DB first

[18:12:00] <PublicWiFi> oh I already do that lol
[18:12:06] <int0x1C8> you'll have to learn whatever intricacies there are with the ORM you use, unless you roll your own
[18:12:10] <PublicWiFi> step 1 get a hold of the sql database
[18:12:26] <PublicWiFi> Yeah I had no idea what the DB looks like

[18:52:24] <csws> that telerik article seems pretty good
[18:52:28] <PublicWiFi> ty
[18:52:34] <csws> a little out of date though, 2020
[18:53:05] <PublicWiFi> ahhh
[18:53:14] <PublicWiFi> so WinUI 2 was like.. MS store type apps
[18:53:16] <PublicWiFi> gross
[18:53:22] <PublicWiFi> but WinUI 3 is full native stuff now
[18:53:45] <PublicWiFi> WinUI 3 seems like its the future

[18:54:26] <PublicWiFi> what about WinForms

[19:00:22] <int0x1C8> yeah, transactions will prevent those for the most part
[19:00:25] <PublicWiFi> the answer to that seemed "simple" tbh, didn't require any kind of super thought out solution
[19:00:35] <csws> it really depends on what's going on
[19:00:38] <PublicWiFi> right
[19:00:50] <csws> if you're writing to the same table then it's probalby no big deal
[19:01:02] <csws> there's an option to lock tables but that's shit
[19:01:42] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Was gonna say it sounds like they want a table lock
[19:02:48] <PublicWiFi> that doesn't sound good if you have a very active system
[19:02:56] <PublicWiFi> you're basically inserting a shit load of i/o wait lol
[19:03:15] <Hunterkll> it really depends  
[19:03:29] <csws> but say you're touching an audit log, adding a row for something happened, as an example
[19:03:43] <csws> if two people write at the same time then it's no big deal right?
[19:04:02] <csws> like what are you worried about happening?
[19:04:39] <Hunterkll> sure, that's fine, but say you have the potential for something outside to need concurrent accurate information 
[19:04:48] <Hunterkll> lock during write, release, allow reads that were pending

[19:56:08] <Hunterkll> hopefully
[19:56:18] <Hunterkll> having the vax should give you an easier ride

[19:56:55] <PublicWiFi> honetly the worst part about the whole thing is the damn 10 day bullshit

[19:57:42] <Activ8> I think I watched too much squid games

[19:59:04] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: yea, get tested, even if negative, stay home till better anyway - don't want to give people potential 2nd chance infections etc 
[19:59:15] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: there's people with covid vax who haven't gotten their flu shots, etc 
[19:59:25] <dragonfleas> have you guys seen the flu numbers? it's crazy how much masks have basically dropped flu levels to miraculous lows
[19:59:28] <int0x1C8> yeah I don't get flu shots
[19:59:49] <Hunterkll> it's a good idea if you can do it for free
[19:59:53] <Hunterkll> i just do it by convinence 
[19:59:56] <dragonfleas> i get my flu shot
[19:59:59] <int0x1C8> all common infectious illnesses are in a low
[19:59:59] <dragonfleas> i love vaccines
[20:00:14] <PublicWiFi> dragonfleas: prolly
[20:00:17] <dragonfleas> i love the rush of the needle going in, injecting me with a superpower against an illness
[20:00:21] <dragonfleas> fucking modern medicine is sick
[20:00:37] <dragonfleas> i guess that was kind of worded strangely
[20:00:42] <Hunterkll> "masks dont work" well why the fuck do surgeons wear them then 
[20:00:43] <PublicWiFi> needles are the worst

[20:00:59] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi:  lol when i got my shot the nurse was like do you mind around your tattoo? I was like nah wherever
[20:01:08] <Hunterkll> that bitch VICIOUSLY Stabbed my pikachu tattoo right in the eye 
[20:01:10] <dragonfleas> you have tats Hunterkll?
[20:01:18] <PublicWiFi> i get vaccines for stuff that has more than a 10% chance to kill me xD
[20:01:23] <PublicWiFi> no flu shot pls
[20:01:26] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: that's like, almost nothing
[20:01:43] <csws> dragonfleas, stats in aus show bugger all respiratory deaths during winter last year and there was no mandate so I wouldn't attribute it to masks imo
[20:01:43] <Hunterkll> i've got vaccines against diseases that haven't really hit america in like a century 
[20:01:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:01:44] <dragonfleas> get your fucking plague and rabies shots LOL
[20:01:50] <int0x1C8> even covid is still only 1%
[20:01:55] <PublicWiFi> ^
[20:01:58] <Hunterkll> more than that, but still.....
[20:01:58] <PublicWiFi> so not in my list of needles
[20:02:01] <PublicWiFi> xD
[20:02:18] <int0x1C8> or around that order of magnitude, certainly closer to 1% than to 10% or 0.1%
[20:02:28] <csws> 1%? seems high
[20:02:29] <dragonfleas> csws i wonder if it's the more isolated people and work from home
[20:02:37] <PublicWiFi> csws: it is but fear porn is a thing
[20:02:38] <Hunterkll> more around ~2%ish, but the shadow effect of hospital overload isn't factored into that
[20:02:46] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: and raw data isn't 
[20:02:51] <JollyRgrs> Hunterkll: "i can't breath with this mask, it's killing my brain cells" ... "so that brain surgeon that wears a mask 12+ hrs a day?"
[20:03:02] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: right?
[20:03:04] <dragonfleas> the arguments against masks are so fucking idiotic
[20:03:06] <PublicWiFi> also aren't surgeon's masks sealed around the face?
[20:03:11] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: nope
[20:03:13] <PublicWiFi> most masks I see have gaps around the mouth/cheeks
[20:03:14] <int0x1C8> it can be as high as like 5% in regions with particularly shitty healthcare infra
[20:03:23] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: the same "surgical mask" you buy on amazon is what's used in hospitals
[20:03:24] <csws> though the surgeon isn't wearing the same mask and he's in an air conditioned operating theatre not working outside nor doing a task that's labour intensive..
[20:03:26] <Hunterkll> because it's effective 
[20:03:34] <JollyRgrs> it's to keep spital, et al from going OUT of their mouths... and lesser so to keep things like blood from getting into theirs
[20:03:39] <Hunterkll> csws: yes, yes, actually, he is
[20:03:47] <dragonfleas> int0x1C8, that's the unfortunate case for a lot of my friends in africa, i have a buddy in zimbabwe that i play tarkov with, and he said fucking people drop like flies there
[20:03:49] <JollyRgrs> have you SEEN some surgeons in action?
[20:03:50] <PublicWiFi> i'd also argue that surgeons practice "sterilization in layers"
[20:03:55] <int0x1C8> JollyRgrs, you mean spittle?
[20:03:57] <csws> I feel bad for the poor bastards who had to work outdoors when tehy slapped a mandate in for 2 weeks in january
[20:04:02] <csws> 40C heat and wearing a fkn mask lol
[20:04:03] <csws> screw that
[20:04:08] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: sure, but that doesn't account for respiratory/heat 
[20:04:12] <JollyRgrs> int0x1C8: hush you, trying to P1 call at the same time
[20:04:12] <PublicWiFi> csws: for real
[20:04:18] <Hunterkll> csws: with regular surgical masks .... that's not an issue
[20:04:23] <PublicWiFi> i tried running in a mask at my gym and it sucked ass
[20:04:24] <Hunterkll> csws: now try doing it in MOPP4 
[20:04:25] <dragonfleas> if you are socially distancing AND outside, mask isn't necessary unless it's a very crowded area
[20:04:31] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: get a frame 
[20:04:37] <PublicWiFi> or i just won't wear it
[20:04:39] <PublicWiFi> simple fix lol
[20:04:41] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: what sucks is just breathing in the hot/moist air
[20:04:42] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: they literally make little strap in frames that work 
[20:04:45] <PublicWiFi> dragonfleas: yeah some countries mandated outside masks though so rip
[20:04:49] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: then you're an asshole 
[20:04:49] <JollyRgrs> not that it isn't oxygen filled, it is just hot and humid
[20:04:51] <csws> dragonfleas, the rules are always batshit when they do them here. they always put in outdoor mandates. honestly moronic imo
[20:05:00] <PublicWiFi> JollyRgrs: yeah exaatly, like being under your cover too long at night
[20:05:06] <PublicWiFi> just gets moist and "harder to breathe"
[20:05:12] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: that's what the frame is for 
[20:05:19] <dragonfleas> outdoor mandates don't make sense to me, indoor ones absolutely i'm on board with

[20:06:15] <Hunterkll> once they rolled back mandates people went ape shit retired 
[20:06:19] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi:  it's not fear porn though?

[20:06:27] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: how is actual hard science fear porn?
[20:06:32] <PublicWiFi> im not gonna get into a big debate on sysadmin chan lol
[20:06:48] <JollyRgrs> for the sake of unvaccinated kids who are too young to get it, pls wear your masks
[20:06:52] <JollyRgrs> if for nothing else
[20:06:53] <dragonfleas> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[20:07:01] <csws> jesus fucking christ
[20:07:04] <int0x1C8> just so long as you know that you're wrong and should feel terrible for being wrong
[20:07:09] <Hunterkll> ESPECIALLY if you're unvaccinated 
[20:07:10] <csws> imagine vaccinating fucking children against this coof
[20:07:12] <JollyRgrs> to do otherwise isn't an issue of science or not... it's just being selfish
[20:07:12] <PublicWiFi> i really dont
[20:07:15] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[20:07:16] <dragonfleas> oh god
[20:07:17] <PublicWiFi> and i've already had it
[20:07:23] <dragonfleas> we've brought out the idiots in the chat
[20:07:25] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: doesn't matter
[20:07:25] <PublicWiFi> and I'm pretty sure i had delta
[20:07:31] <gibby> !up 441
[20:07:31] <DoTheNeedful> gibby: your upvote has been applied to quote #441.
[20:07:35] <PublicWiFi> but thats speculation
[20:07:39] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: the idea of "natural immunity" being better is only in combination WITH vaccine
[20:07:45] <Hunterkll> natural + vax = better than vax 
[20:07:49] <dragonfleas> yep
[20:07:51] <PublicWiFi> no ty
[20:08:11] <gibby> yikes
[20:08:14] <PublicWiFi> hey im not saying anything bad about vaccinated folks, honestly its your body your choice
[20:08:15] <dragonfleas> they have said t-cell response is better with natural infection, but vaccines have a better total antibody response
[20:08:20] <PublicWiFi> i just choose not to :/
[20:08:21] <dragonfleas> so the combination of the two is like super-protection
[20:08:22] <gibby> imagine not getting a vaccine because you're a fucking idiot.
[20:08:26] <Hunterkll> ^
[20:08:29] <dragonfleas> ^
[20:08:31] <dragonfleas> gibby++
[20:08:39] <csws> imagine signing up for hte vaccine subscription
[20:08:40] <gibby> BUT MUH RITES
[20:08:45] <Hunterkll> A vaccine that's been 10+ years in development lol
[20:08:46] <dragonfleas> MUH FREEDUMS
[20:08:50] <PublicWiFi> attack me all you want its kind of disappointing though
[20:08:52] <csws> a vaccine so great that it doesn't stop people from getting sick, seriously ill or dying
[20:09:03] <dragonfleas> csws ?????????????
[20:09:06] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[20:09:07] <csws> and that the government apparently can't sell on its own merits but instead wants to compel everyone through passports that absolutely definitely won't spy on you
[20:09:12] <Hunterkll> csws: .... what? 
[20:09:17] <PublicWiFi> oh yeah csws is in aussie so he fucking gets it
[20:09:18] <gibby> ooooooookay
[20:09:19] <Hunterkll> csws: uh, are you high ?
[20:09:20] <PublicWiFi> xD
[20:09:26] <gibby> enough of that fucking bullshit
[20:09:28] <csws> JUST SCAN THE QR CODE
[20:09:30] <Hunterkll> csws: this isn't the first time we've had vaccine passports in the US 
[20:09:30] <csws> IT"S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD
[20:09:31] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[20:09:39] <dragonfleas> there's 7000 languages in the world and csws you chose to speak some bullshit
[20:09:42] <PublicWiFi> im kind of sad yall were so mean to me
[20:09:44] <PublicWiFi> xD
[20:09:54] <Hunterkll> csws: and for what it's worth, read the actual *science* and *studies* and HARD DATA 
[20:09:55] <PublicWiFi> brb while i drink
[20:09:58] <Hunterkll> guess what
[20:10:00] <csws> idk I'm getting close to bedtime so care factor is approaching 0 right now
[20:10:03] <Hunterkll> the government can sell it on its own merits
[20:10:18] <csws> so why are they threatening to sack me
[20:10:26] <Hunterkll> because you're a threat
[20:10:27] <PublicWiFi> this is scary convo now
[20:10:28] <gibby> PublicWiFi: we care about you and want you get the jab, its silly not to and there is zero reason not to
[20:10:32] <Hunterkll> Vaccine passports and mask mandates work. Ask the US - we've had ~150+ years of experience in this shit 
[20:10:33] <csws> lmfao
[20:10:42] <gibby> like, genuinely 
[20:11:10] <Hunterkll> gibby: idk my lingering side effect of going to vegas and not getting sick with a crowded convention sphere is kind of a bad downside 
[20:11:11] <PublicWiFi> i've weighed the options honestly, Im' not singling out the covid vaccine or anything
[20:11:20] <PublicWiFi> im not much on needles, I dont get the flu one either xD
[20:11:28] <Hunterkll> I can get not getting the flu one
[20:11:31] <dragonfleas> imagine being proud of being a potential walking biological weapon against the public and wearing a "MUH FREEDUMS SAY DONT MASK UP" shirt like a fucking /pol/ boomer
[20:11:32] <gibby> yeah, those are silly reasons
[20:11:33] <PublicWiFi> i took my chance, and i got the virus a few months ago and lived to tell the tale
[20:11:35] <Hunterkll> but the flu doesn't have an R factor of over 1.x 
[20:11:38] <csws> I might check out novavax when it arrives
[20:11:53] <PublicWiFi> i made the risk assessment for myself and went with it
[20:11:58] <csws> kinda depends what's going on at the time
[20:12:00] <PublicWiFi> same as you
[20:12:05] <Hunterkll> csws: i'm a strong proponent of Moderna based on the actual hard data 
[20:12:07] <csws> I think it's a few months away still
[20:12:11] <PublicWiFi> i just chose differently, I'm not some science denying guy or anything I just simply didn't want it
[20:12:17] <gibby> well, you need an external assessment because your "AR"s are off
[20:12:18] <Hunterkll> right - people who don't get the vax are pushing this out further and further
[20:12:23] <dragonfleas> moderna holds the best protection right now
[20:12:35] <int0x1C8> oh wait that's right I got moderna not pfizer
[20:12:47] <dragonfleas> I'm going to get pfizer booster hopefully, they just opened it up to people at 6 month mark, and i hit my 6 month mark this month
[20:12:54] <Hunterkll> yea Moderna's best long term 
[20:12:57] <gibby> and this is where I'll gently push this discussion to literally anything else
[20:13:00] <Hunterkll> according to actual hard data 
[20:13:03] <PublicWiFi> gibby: +
[20:13:03] <dragonfleas> but i have to wait till it's for general populous and not just immunocompromised
[20:13:11] <gibby> PublicWiFi: I heard you like nano
[20:13:12] <Hunterkll> csws: https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/26/is-novavax-delaying-its-covid-vaccine-eua-filings/
[20:13:12] <technonerd> tits up
[20:13:14] <gibby> nano is the best
[20:13:24] <Hunterkll> Novavax is pushing their shit to hell and high water to delay
[20:13:28] <technonerd> joe /tmp/secrets
[20:13:28] <dragonfleas> i don't mind nano tbh
[20:13:34] <dragonfleas> but you need to at least know vim
[20:13:39] <gibby> psssh
[20:13:42] <gibby> vim is for nerds
[20:13:50] <PublicWiFi> gibby: im more of a emacs kind of guy
[20:13:55] <gibby> you heathen 
[20:13:57] <PublicWiFi> jk i can't even say that with a straight face
[20:13:58] * Hunterkll /mode +b gibby reason: NERD
[20:14:12] <technonerd> vim is for  installing system updates and generating entropy
[20:14:20] <Hunterkll> csws: but yea, novavax is .... questionable, at best 
[20:14:28] <gibby> Hunterkll: move to a different topic
[20:14:39] <dragonfleas> i need a refresher on vim commands
[20:14:41] <Hunterkll> csws: moderna has a shitload of published data 
[20:14:46] <gibby> Hunterkll: move to a different topic
[20:15:13] <Hunterkll> nope
[20:15:48] * dragonfleas throws a wet fish at Hunterkll
[20:16:02] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: was this fish tested for cleveland ? 
[20:16:11] <dragonfleas> cleveland...ohio?

[20:17:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> yea
[20:17:37] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: what kind of bandwidth do you need?
[20:17:40] <PublicWiFi> no problems, even i na coal mine setting for years

[20:17:49] <gibby> kidding
[20:17:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> Hunterkll minimal buddy of mine wants to link a generator to their wifi network
[20:17:58] <E-werd> gib 10g
[20:18:04] <gibby> ^
[20:18:12] <AnonymooseReddtr> Generator > (wired ethernet) > Radio -> link to building
[20:18:14] <gibby> 10 and 40 gig options pls
[20:18:21] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: dude.... a  WRT54G would work for that 
[20:18:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:18:24] <Hunterkll> like
[20:18:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> haha 
[20:18:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah
[20:18:32] <dragonfleas> didn't linus just do a video on LOS ubiquiti stuff
[20:18:39] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: that's overkill
[20:18:48] <E-werd> Man, I knew what that link was before I clicked on it
[20:18:53] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: heres what happens if you don't vaccinate your f ish https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIbmT2Rs8vw
[20:19:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> Hunterkll yeah that was kinda the idea lol 
[20:19:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> it could literally join the 802.11 network
[20:19:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> just trying to find a WAP that can do it
[20:19:22] <dragonfleas> and the icing on the cake

[20:19:28] <E-werd> Cleveland is a lot better nowadays, the Cuyahoga no longer catches on fire
[20:19:29] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: ahh, so you need a 'client mode' AP 
[20:19:30] <PublicWiFi> oh noooo
[20:19:34] <Hunterkll> AnonymooseReddtr: aka a wifi bridge 
[20:19:36] <PublicWiFi> unifi got rid of nanostations?

[20:21:14] <dragonfleas> that guy's a fucking genius
[20:21:17] <PublicWiFi> oh they have nanosttions still, phew
[20:21:39] <JollyRgrs> E-werd: tbh, the UX is a lot better to navigate for me, functionality is probably not different at the end of it... except opnsense does wireguard right and pfsense did it wrong, and did it REALLY dirty
[20:21:43] <PublicWiFi> these things were really solid for me
[20:22:22] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: pfsense also  did it *early*
[20:22:35] <Hunterkll> i prefer pfsense over opnsense myself 
[20:22:37] <Hunterkll> if i had to chose
[20:22:44] <Hunterkll> but i'd still chose to spend $80 to avoid both 
[20:23:11] <JollyRgrs> what does $80 get you?
[20:23:23] <E-werd> one really good case of beer, or two decent ones
[20:23:33] <E-werd> or like 4 cases of cheap beer
[20:23:34] <dragonfleas> are there any purpose built opnsense appliances you guys would recommend?
[20:23:51] <PublicWiFi> edge router maybe?
[20:23:53] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: an edgerouter
[20:23:54] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:23:54] <JollyRgrs> i used pfsense for a while, i was thinking about moving to opnsense for a bit, but the wireguard thing really pushed me to make the change quickly... since i was using wireguard on pfsense and then they had to remove it
[20:23:59] <Hunterkll> LOLOLOLOLOLOL
[20:24:00] <Hunterkll> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG75VF_i7HI
[20:24:03] <Hunterkll> HAhahahhaha
[20:24:04] <JollyRgrs> Hunterkll: i prefer the features on opnsense vs edgerouter
[20:24:13] <Hunterkll> "We've got hills high enough to make michael jordan feel scared"
[20:24:15] <JollyRgrs> otherwise i'd rather an appliance as well
[20:24:19] <PublicWiFi> i thought bout moving to opsense too, do you like it as much?
[20:25:02] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: depends on what you're using i guess
[20:25:11] <Hunterkll> cheap low power throughput with firewall etc

[20:28:29] <JollyRgrs> i don't NEED LE to run on the router, I could run it on any of my VMs
[20:29:00] <Hunterkll> newer version: https://community.ui.com/questions/DNS-Adblocking-and-Blacklisting-dnsmasq-Configuration-Integration-Package-v1-2-4-5/eb05f1b2-5316-4a80-8221-5e8b02575da4
[20:29:01] <JollyRgrs> so not natively, gotta run a third party script to do it?
[20:29:22] <Hunterkll> sure, but it integrates with the CLI and web ui 
[20:29:33] <Hunterkll> just modifies the dnsmasq configuration
[20:29:51] <JollyRgrs> hmm
[20:30:06] <JollyRgrs> and you can get the ER for $80?
[20:30:17] <Hunterkll> $69 - $XXXX 
[20:30:24] <Hunterkll> ER-X is your cheapest bit 
[20:30:43] <Hunterkll> the ERL-3's I use are all routed ports
[20:30:48] <JollyRgrs> i need gigglebits for sure. and they can do wireguard and openvpn?
[20:30:49] <Hunterkll> ER-X is one wan port, and 4 switch ports
[20:31:17] <Hunterkll> https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-vyatta-ubnt
[20:31:54] <JollyRgrs> and pls to be showing me where i can get a gigabit er-x for $80
[20:32:02] <dragonfleas> excited for faster disk io
[20:32:23] <int0x1C8> 10 jiggle-bits
[20:32:37] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: last time i was at microcenter they had like 20 on the shelves 
[20:33:08] <JollyRgrs> yeah, no microcenter here
[20:33:36] <Hunterkll> ERL-3's i use are $149  
[20:33:41] <JollyRgrs> amazon is showing like $200 for a 4 port
[20:33:45] <Hunterkll>  I'm planning to go to an ER-4 
[20:33:51] <Hunterkll> ER-X is only 4 port (access) 
[20:34:12] <Hunterkll> ER-4 is $199
[20:34:40] <Hunterkll> i bought my backup (now primary) ER-3 here in irc lol
[20:35:10] <JollyRgrs> i really only need i really only need 1 WAN 1 LAN port for my router at the moment
[20:35:23] <JollyRgrs> i just need to be able to handle gigabit (at least)
[20:35:33] <Hunterkll> ER-4 would be best i think
[20:35:35] <Hunterkll> $199 
[20:35:58] <JollyRgrs> yeah.... so $200, not $80
[20:36:10] <Hunterkll> well to combine all use cases 
[20:36:18] <Hunterkll> ERL-3 and ER-X can do gigabit but 
[20:36:26] <Hunterkll>  https://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Networks-ER-4-EdgeRouter-4/dp/B078PGCGN2
[20:36:32] <Hunterkll> ER-4 throws down extra capacity 
[20:37:31] <shakygator> holup
[20:37:36] <shakygator> er-x cant handle full gigabit
[20:37:42] <shakygator> they got a new one?
[20:37:59] <Hunterkll> shakygator: it can depending on config, features in use, hardware offloading, etc
[20:38:08] <Hunterkll> shakygator: i've tested one with 920mbps throughput with NAT 
[20:38:11] <shakygator> nah not totally, i have one and i have gigabit
[20:38:31] <shakygator> the problem is it can handle gigabit aggregate, but that doenst take into account the "LAN" side of things
[20:38:43] <shakygator> for some reason i can test 900+ up, but only about 500 down
[20:38:47] <Hunterkll> shakygator: my config i use an ER-X to concentrate ipsec tunnels to offload off of the ERL-3 
[20:38:49] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:39:12] <Hunterkll> it's HIGHLY config dependant 
[20:39:16] <Hunterkll> an ER-4 however, will just work
[20:39:18] <shakygator> it just cant do it
[20:39:30] <shakygator> ive gone through all of it, its better with hardware offloading ofc
[20:39:44] <Hunterkll> shakygator: latest 2.x firmware has changed some shit up
[20:39:52] <Hunterkll> they just gave up and front ported the hardware offload shit 
[20:39:59] <Hunterkll> from 1.9x
