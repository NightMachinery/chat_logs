[02:57:05] <opalvaults[m]> jmercouris: fwiw,  this is from the Guix package repository.
[03:02:29] <waleee> hm some log4cl stuff in there, which would be ironic since it's the package responsible for the log-output
[03:03:45] <waleee> but it just looks like some guix-related warnings for it [log4cl] got caught in the backtrace

[04:20:14] <opalvaults[m]> here's one more. I'll go ahead and forward these along to the bug list
[04:29:35] <mariari> I get crahses often
[04:29:46] <mariari> opalvaults[m]: is this a special build that gets  memory faults with stack traces
[04:29:50] <mariari> haven't updated this month
[04:35:14] <waleee> the multiple threads is a bit trippy sometimes. Eg in those traces where you get a last printout before nyxt goes down entirely

[05:00:52] <opalvaults[m]> mariari: nothing special about my build as far as I know. It's 2.2.3 in the Guix Repo. I haven't updated in a couple of days however. I'll do that now.

[06:14:33] <qhong> Question: why we are saving and restoring old-%buffer explicitly in with-current-buffer? Isn't dynamic binding itself enough?
[06:14:41] *** Joins: stonekyx (~stonekyx@ec2-54-199-42-68.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com)
[06:15:35] <qhong> Emacs has to destructively save/restore because its current-buffer is not a proper Lisp variable and cannot by dynamically bound. Our %buffer however is a proper Lisp variable

[10:54:44] <jmercouris> qhong: however buffer inherits from a renderer buffer - gtk-buffer which has non lisp objects in it
[10:54:58] <jmercouris> These memory locations have a series of problems
[10:55:21] <jmercouris> Also I haven’t yet answered you on irc or discord because I’m trying to take vacation :-D
[10:55:31] <jmercouris> Though I have seen your posts, don’t worry
[11:01:49] <qhong> jmercouris: ah I see. let me check that part of code
[11:02:26] <qhong> jmercouris: no worries, I'm also heading out for vacation tomorrow ;) I'm leaving tons of problems cuz I'm hacking an S-expr editor these days
[11:06:15] <Jing> qhong: Structural editing?
[11:07:22] <qhong> Jing: yes, as a continuation to https://www.reddit.com/r/Nyxt/comments/reviuk/feature_request_is_it_possible_to_have_a_full/
[11:08:42] <qhong> I also figure once it's done it could probably do much more than an Common Lisp IDE. For example, maybe one can edit an HTML document visually, and use a command to switch between WYSIWYG representation and inline spinneret S-expr representation (lispified inspect-element)
[11:09:21] <qhong> and the switch can be done for dom-node/subtree of the document, instead of the whole document
[11:11:30] <qhong> jmercouris: I'm still a bit suspicious about the necessity of what with-current-buffer is doing, because it seems that it doesn't touch any FFI stuff, the only thing it does is to mess with the %buffer symbol, and we know in CL symbol doesn't have watcher etc on it, and setting it won't do weird stuff. Guess the only way to find out is to try replace it myself and run the tests

[13:44:37] <ardon> I'm trying to access https://uk.huel.com/ but I get a `downloads-mode' buffer upon entering the site with a "Status: Failed". I'm pretty sure this is to do with Shopify as I'm able to reproduce the issue with many sites in this list https://sixads.net/shopify/stores/
[13:48:17] <ardon> Logs don't say anything much useful either "<INFO> [11:17:22] nyxt message.lisp (echo form-fun-6) - Download failed for "https://uk.huel.com/"."
