[01:40:44] <sven792> There are Copyleft and non-copyleft floss licenses. Copyleft like the GPL tries to protect the end user and permissive licenses like e.g. BSD-3-clause or MIT don't do that.
[01:41:49] <coodre> is github anti-copyleft? since it's owned by microsoft?
[01:43:07] <Kolev> coodre: GitHub has always pushed permissive licensing.

[02:05:23] <echoSMILE> sven792: which extra permission ? 
[02:05:55] <sven792> licensing permission for your code I think
[02:06:31] <echoSMILE> Can you show any reference about that ?
[02:11:48] <coodre> Github Terms Of Service Section D.7: "To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service."
[02:12:06] <sven792> https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service
[02:15:23] <sven792> If all the rightholders are on GitHub. GitHub can probably do nearly everything with the code for their services.
[02:17:17] <Noisytoot> So are things like https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils a GPL violation?
[02:19:49] <coodre> github probably only has limited rights on it

[17:04:25] <sven792> Is Gitlab a good git hosting platform? (software and the service provider)
[17:05:53] <coodre> gitlab requires javascript to even render anything
[17:05:57] <DiffieHellman> sven792: Nope, even though its free software, gitlab doesn't allow for even viewing repositories without JavaScript.
[17:06:27] <labrador> sven792, yes. Free javascript is fine
[17:06:34] <DiffieHellman> Use cgit if you want a good git hosting platform.
[17:06:46] <labrador> Even though if you're self hosting,gitlab will be a monster to setup
[17:06:59] <labrador> Use gitea instead then

[17:08:57] <DiffieHellman> JavaScript gives a terrible experience even if it's libre.
[17:09:01] <labrador> Gitlab is also much more capable than anything you and me can recommend.

[17:09:24] <coodre> but if you use it to render the pages (when HTML can do it), it's stupid
[17:09:43] <DiffieHellman> I expect the page to be loaded once the browser tells me it is, I'm angered when JavaScript still has things to do.
[17:10:21] <DiffieHellman> coodre: The JavaScript generates HTML and then gives that to the browser, so ultra-stupidity.
[17:10:57] <coodre> we should cut javascript support from browsers to make websites less dependent on javascript

[20:20:24] <ggoes> haunt is cool
[20:20:27] <leah> the way my static site generator currently works is it literally does find and then goes through each file, checking modification dates. that is slow, but works for small sites quite well
[20:20:36] <Kolev> If only Git had a UI as nice as the GUI for GNU Bazaar.
[20:21:05] <leah> yeah and with that, i could make it automatically show revision history for pages. even if a given site itself isn't in git
[20:21:11] <Kolev> ggoes: My current problem with Haunt is getting it to support my existing URI scheme.
[20:21:17] <leah> haunt would be better for fsf
[20:21:21] <leah> if it uses a static site generator
[20:21:49] <Kolev> leah: Haunt is a static site generator written in Guile.
[20:22:03] <ggoes> we have a few schemers on staff i think; or at least people who like lisp. but a crucial thing would be something everyone could use, even nontechnical volunteers. i'm not sure haunt fits the bill for that

[20:27:43] <leah> i'm guessing you just include in subject "hb1273 testimony" or something like that
[20:27:49] <leah> and then write whatever you want in the body text
[20:28:13] <ggoes> yeah
[20:29:08] <leah> it's worth looking into
[20:29:17] <leah> lots of people could then send testimony, even if not showing up in person
[20:29:22] <leah> though, showing up in person is still ideal
[20:29:34] <ggoes> if eric hasn't published it i'm a little hesitant to put it in the article. but i'll try and think of a way to share it with people, like if they write campaigns@
[20:29:35] <leah> i'd go myself, but i don't fancy a 10 hour flight
[20:29:44] <leah> being in the uk, that is
[20:29:48] <ggoes> yeah
[20:29:55] <leah> yeah don't put that email address in the article
[20:30:03] <leah> i did press eric, but he hasn't responded
[20:30:23] <leah> if i'm honest, he seems really bad at outreach, and generally at organizing
[20:30:26] <leah> though the bill is excellent
[20:30:58] <leah> if enough of the right people show up, and (as i anticipate will occur) with some light changes, the bill may well pass

[20:32:10] <ggoes> yeah, that would be rad & a great boost
[20:32:32] <leah> the bill itself isn't actually interesting at first
[20:32:40] <leah> it will have minimal effect, especially only in one state
[20:32:45] <leah> but it sets a precedent
[20:32:49] <ggoes> right
[20:32:54] <leah> it'll only be so much easier after that to say:
[20:33:03] <leah> why don't we have the kids using free software at school?
[20:33:07] <leah> and then we win
[20:33:33] <leah> and that's who i'm thinking about
[20:33:46] <leah> a bunch of bureaucrats using gnu+linux is one thing
[20:34:07] <leah> handing in your class project written in libreoffice instead of word is a whole other game

[20:34:48] <leah> just like maths is
[20:34:57] <leah> in british schools, kids get taught programming these days
[20:35:15] <leah> though not necessarily free software stuff
[20:35:30] <leah> e.g. in many cases they'll use c# and visual studio
[20:35:36] <leah> non-free
[20:35:54] <Kaiod> leah: Lack of investment and competence of the department responsible for the education of this child (state, federation or municipality). Also lack of investment in the education of the profissonal in education about free knowledge and technology.

[20:38:08] <GNUHacker> lol
[20:38:22] <leah> i can see it now:
[20:38:28] <Kaiod> Kaiod: When we deal with education, the philosophical and social context, which will be added to this child, must be analyzed. The issue of freedom and knowledge are key points that must be exemplified to the decision makers using the philosophy of GNU and the context of the local community.

[20:38:53] *** Joins: tpefreedom (~tpefreedo@user/tpefreedom)
[20:39:05] <GNUHacker> arch is non-free distro, I recommend #parabola instead

[20:39:29] <ewwegweg> or trisquel ı think
[20:39:30] <leah> aur might have non-free stuff
[20:39:41] <Kaiod> leah: I think a free educational debian is more likely
[20:40:13] <leah> though parabola is a competent distro
[20:40:22] <isf> arch gnu/linux*
[20:40:25] <ggoes> continue the grand tradition of using scheme in CS education by having them install guix haha
[20:40:25] <leah> and even makes some nice improvements, besides mere deblobbing
[20:40:45] <Kaiod> Maybe, the government will develop their own software for schools, in Brazil this was done by the Ministry of Education, they developed Educational Linux (no, they didn't put GNU/Linux).
[20:41:04] <isf> how
[20:41:04] <leah> for instance, last time i used it, its version of pidgin was modified to recommend freedom-friendly protocols more prominently, whereas upstream pidgin recommended stuff like gmail and msn
[20:41:10] <leah> this was years ago
[20:41:14] <hiya> What do you think about Intel's ClearLinux?
[20:41:24] <leah> i haven't used parabola since 2012
[20:41:52] <leah> intel doing linux?
[20:41:56] <hiya> I am switching in between Fedora, Arch and Debian for past few months. Also, checking out ClearLinux
[20:41:57] <hiya> Yes
[20:42:07] <hiya> Their own distro with class-leading performance 
[20:42:21] <hiya> in most benchmarks
[20:42:21] <tpefreedom> leah, iirc the mainline kernel also contains blobs. Deblobbled kernels (like debian's) and linux-libre are fully free however.
[20:42:43] <ggoes> there's a very old version of parabola still running on one of the fsf's few working lemote yeeloongs
[20:43:31] <hiya> so if you have a laptop [your only primary machine for work/play/experiments]

[22:51:42] <Kaiod> Guys, does anyone know where I can find the code from the Emacs website? Is it on GNU's ftp or somewhere else?

[22:53:11] <zleap> by code from the emacs website, do you mean emacs source code or the website source code

[22:55:57] <jxself> The "Use CVS" has info on doing a checkout.
[22:56:12] <jxself> You want the "webpage repository"

[23:09:40] <jxself> CVS is all that Savannah supports for web pages.
[23:09:57] <jxself> So until/unless Savannah itself supports something different, that is it.
