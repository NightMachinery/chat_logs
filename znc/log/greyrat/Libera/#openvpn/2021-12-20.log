[13:28:35] <UncleKiwi> greetings wise vpn masters
[13:30:26] <UncleKiwi> i have a voip device capable of running an openvpn client - I believe this vpn can be not only used for the VoIP traffic but also for maybe being able to remote admin the device 
[13:30:59] <UncleKiwi> I am more interested in the remote admin'ing of the device over the VPN
[13:31:54] <UncleKiwi> im thinking maybe I could create an Openvpn server and get all the devices to connect to that network and then I could connect to the devices from this management network
[13:32:07] <UncleKiwi> does this sound possible ? 
[13:33:49] <UncleKiwi> I imagine that my openvpn server would push an ip especially for the device - and this would give me predictability of which device was which
[13:38:52] <ordex> UncleKiwi: sure
[13:39:11] <ordex> if the voip phone is granting you the possibility of providing a config file or providing some settings
[13:39:24] <UncleKiwi> ordex: hi ordex
[13:39:32] <ordex> it's likely that they are running some ancient openvpn version, so troubles have to be expected, but surely you should give it a try
[13:39:36] <UncleKiwi> yeah its providing all that 
[13:40:23] <UncleKiwi> maybe this is the reason they built in the vpn - for the remote admin'ing
[13:40:36] <UncleKiwi> and also VoIP over NAT avoidance 
[13:41:33] <UncleKiwi> my intention here is to create a management network for maybe 100s of these 
[13:41:54] <UncleKiwi> which will mean I need to the IP addressing right
[13:42:02] <ordex> UncleKiwi: sure - whether the mgmt interface is accessible or not, fully depends on the voip phone though
[13:42:14] <UncleKiwi> yeah true 
[13:42:20] <UncleKiwi> I think I will give it a try 
[13:42:25] <ordex> but i expect it to be reported in the user manual or somewhere in the spec?
[13:42:28] <ordex> yup yup
[13:42:31] <ordex> might be the fastest approach
[13:42:42] <UncleKiwi> yeah 
[13:42:50] <ordex> the VPN may still be considered some sort of WAN, so the phone will refuse access from there
[13:43:02] <ordex> but yeah, you can try with one phone befor emoving on with the other 99 :)
[13:43:05] <UncleKiwi> maybe 
[13:43:12] <UncleKiwi> yep exacto
[13:43:37] <UncleKiwi> would be cool if it works
[13:45:09] <ordex> yap
[13:45:20] <ordex> maybe the phone also ha ssettings to decide whether to allow mgmt access from outside
[13:45:37] <UncleKiwi> I think it does actually

[14:37:55] <UncleKiwi> ordex: how would I be able to assign the same ip addresses to the connecting clients - so that I can be able to give meaning to the ip addreses of connecting devices
[14:38:15] <UncleKiwi> are the virtual ip addresses given out randomly ? 
[14:38:39] <UncleKiwi> or can this be controlled 
[14:38:45] <ordex> it can
[14:38:58] <ordex> if you just want the same IP to be re-assigned to the same client, check --ifconfig-pool-persist in the manpage
[14:39:08] <UncleKiwi> nice
[14:39:16] <UncleKiwi> that is what I want
[14:39:22] <UncleKiwi> I need consistancy 
[14:39:22] <ordex> if you want to control the IP assignment, then check --client-config-dir
[14:39:39] <ordex> with the latter you can specify what specific option to send to each client
[14:39:42] <ordex> per client
[14:39:56] <ordex> does not scale well if you do it manually for 100s of clients
[14:41:31] <UncleKiwi> that later is probably better in some ways because if I was to take the config an have second instance of the VPN server and in the event of the loss of one of them i changed the dns ie vpn.domain.com to point to the backup VPN server I would want to have the ip addressing be consistant
[14:41:43] <UncleKiwi> on the backup VPN server

[15:24:38] <rob0> Often another alternative to static IPs is dynamic DNS.  So users use a hostname, and that name always points to the right host.
[15:26:38] <UncleKiwi> thanks rob0 im talking about the virtual ip addresses right ?
[15:27:32] <rob0> what is a virtual IP address?  Oh, you mean the VPN address?  Yes.
[15:27:48] <UncleKiwi> yes its like a private ip addres
[15:28:05] <UncleKiwi> its for use in the management net
[15:28:20] <UncleKiwi> im not sure how I would use a dyn dns like service 
[15:28:27] <UncleKiwi> in this setup 
[15:28:48] <rob0> If you get creative with it, and you have a user who's sometimes remote and sometimes in the office, you can have the hostname point to either one: LAN or VPN.
[15:29:37] <UncleKiwi> or are you meaning that dns can be maintained by the open vpnserver 
[15:29:56] <rob0> dnsmasq(8) is good for dynamic DNS for DHCP clients, and it's not difficult to script something to update /etc/hosts for VPN client connections.
[15:30:40] <UncleKiwi> eg client1  connects and gets the dns name clien1.domain.local and the local dns is updated as the connection occurs
[15:30:53] <rob0> A fancier and standards-compliant approach is BIND named(8) with nsupdate(8) and RFC 2136 updates.
[15:31:05] <rob0> *but that's more challenging
[15:31:23] <UncleKiwi> maybe it does need dyndns but just dns
[15:31:27] <UncleKiwi> local dns 
[15:31:30] <UncleKiwi> :-/
[15:31:40] <rob0> yeah, don't use .local, that's used in mdns (zeroconf)
[15:31:50] <UncleKiwi> ok 
[15:32:01] <rob0> use a name you own, which does not need to resolve externally
[15:32:46] <UncleKiwi> ok cool
[15:34:45] <UncleKiwi> rob0 I think I understand what you are getting at - the devices would not actually update the dyndns but rather a script on the openvpn box 
[15:34:54] <rob0> yes
[15:34:58] <UncleKiwi> omg that is cool
[15:35:05] <rob0> :)
[15:35:27] <UncleKiwi> have you done this kind of setup b4 ?
[15:35:35] <rob0> yes
[15:35:40] <UncleKiwi> nice 
[15:36:08] <UncleKiwi> so we get meaningful name mappings that are dynamic 
[15:36:30] <UncleKiwi> interesting 
[15:37:19] <UncleKiwi> ok its 1am here 
[15:37:23] <UncleKiwi> I need to sleep 
[15:37:30] <rob0> yes.  I've also done the RFC 2136 updating, which is necessary for networks which are too complex for dnsmasq.  But if you can keep the network simple, dnsmasq is best.
[15:37:55] <rob0> yeah, I figured a Kiwi must be late, it's early morning here :)
[15:38:02] <rob0> gn
[15:38:50] <UncleKiwi> gn and thanks - i'll do a bit of research on this topic tomorrow

[15:40:58] * rob0 should update his dnsmasq+openvpn howto to include the /etc/hosts writing
[15:41:45] <rob0> I just left it off at that point because it was a theoretical exercise, not an actual need.
[15:46:20] <rob0> (and I thought that should be pretty simple)

[23:51:29] <xx> they say they need to enter the 2fa code every time their internet drops out for a bit
[23:51:46] <xx> any way of making openvpn not ask for the 2fa after it has been entered once for the session?
