[00:00:05] <ffs> This might be getting off topic, but windows crashes when i try to boot in legacy mode. @tomreyn , rtgg
[00:00:19] <ffs> That's why I switch each time.
[00:00:21] <EtherMan> tomreyn: Right, and I'm asking if that support means at least security patches will be backported. 20.04 being stable, I'd assume that's not going to be updated and PPA hasn't even updated to 9 yet so I'll assume that too is going to be a while before that's going to be updated. So unless at least security fixes are backported, it's not like it's in a safely usable state right now.
[00:00:46] <tomreyn> ffs: i did not suggest to do so, though

[00:01:45] <tomreyn> ffs: my understanding is that you can boot windows in uefi mode (after all, secureboot would not be available otherwise). you're considering to reinstall ubuntu. i'm suggesting that you install ubuntu in uefi mode as well.

[00:02:02] <ffs> I see. The word either mislead me.
[00:02:27] <ffs> Cool. Will try it.
[00:02:47] <cbreak> you can use something like refind if you don't want to switch via the UEFI boot chooser or boot windows via grub, both of which should also work

[00:04:11] <spq> o/ I got a problem: one of 2ssds in my laptop seems to have broken in some way, whenever problematic blocks are read, the device hangs and after a while the device disappears. On the bad disk, i have a LVM PV and a single lv was on that disk, using pvmove I was able to move most blocks to the other disk, now I'm however stuck, as soon as I luksopen
[00:04:12] <spq> the 2nd disk, LVM detects the pvs and starts syncing the pvmove partition and immediately breaks the bad disk, previously I could pvmove --abort quick enough, got an idea how to fix this?

[13:06:14] <hans> any easy-ish way to get an up-to-date rsync on 20.04? specifically i want rsync --atimes introduced in 3.2.0, while 20.04 ships 3.1.3
[13:06:37] <MrSassyPants> because the only "system" thing I did today was try to dpkg -i the discord deb

[13:06:46] <KBar> MrSassyPants, you can do this: `SOME_COMMANDS | pastebinit`
[13:06:51] <KBar> it will automatically upload
[13:07:02] <MrSassyPants> no
[13:08:05] <MrSassyPants> I can't log in to view the paste
[13:08:17] <MrSassyPants> blaarhg, I can't view the paste because I'm not logged in
[13:08:29] <MrSassyPants> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/mQzVK3BByV/ do you see this
[13:08:41] <KBar> yep
[13:09:12] <KBar> Well, you are installing a .deb package here.
[13:09:19] <KBar> .deb and snaps are completely different.
[13:09:41] <MrSassyPants> yes.
[13:09:48] <MrSassyPants> I assumed this was why the snap wasn't autostarting
[13:10:08] <MrSassyPants> well anyhow, the dpkg -i failed
[13:10:17] <MrSassyPants> yet it still managed to screw up the system
[13:10:24] <MrSassyPants> desktop-file-utils seems to be the likely culprit
[13:10:47] <hans> turns out that, by dumb luck, the 21.04 rsync deb (which ships rsync 3.2.3) installs just fine on 20.04 ^^
[13:11:07] <JanC> but does it run also?  :)
[13:11:12] <hans> rsync? yes
[13:11:18] <hans> well, --version runs fine at least

[13:15:03] <hans> can someone on 21.10 tell me what error they get from the command "rsync --crtimes"
[13:15:10] <hans> just that
[13:15:19] <KBar> MrSassyPants, that's very strange. Did you delete the Discord .deb package and now Bash completion works again?

[13:21:31] <KBar> MrSassyPants, regarding your Discord problem: 1) check if the app itself has 'Autostart on login' or a similar option; 2) install gnome-tweak-tool, you can manually add programs there

[20:23:25] <pycode1> sorry

[20:25:00] <p13> if you spend a little extra time now, it won't be fast/ugly.  It will be suitable for production ... well ... other than the fact that that ES version is pretty old
[20:25:49] <pycode1> yes sure ES version is a problem too, but yes, as i wrote my roadmap is 1. fresh ubuntu    2. upgrade the python code to meet ES 7.X requirements
[20:26:08] <pycode1> i do not know the reason but i always tought that docker is used for developing and not for production -_-
[20:26:09] <pycode1> baah
[20:26:22] <p13> no, docker is pretty neat
[20:26:43] <p13> some people try to use it for everything, which i don't necessarily recommend, but it sure has it's uses

[22:48:25] <sers> And, the other method is, a default firefox installation, as in, thru the official apt repository method.

[23:23:19] <charlie_sando> raxor2k, and ensure the permissions to that file are correct ( 0600 I believe )
[23:23:37] <charlie_sando> raxor2k,  you can have him ssh -vvvv '...' to get more error info

[23:24:25] <tomreyn> raxor2k: it won't be a permissions issue if you can alread authenticate using the uother key on this file. and you don't need to restart opensshd, if that's the server you're running.
