[03:51:00] <ska> Thats a Lenovo Flagship Legion 5 17 Gaming Laptop
[03:52:20] <sney> Lenovo hardware is generally very well supported, it'll probably work out of the box with bullseye+nonfree, maybe plus one or two things from backports

[03:53:05] <sussudio> why does it matter if it's a "flagship gaming laptop" anyway
[03:53:18] <sussudio> and why would there be notes
[03:53:22] <ska> No idea. We just need the large memory .
[03:53:47] <sney> ryzen support was a little hairy before the 5.x kernels but I haven't heard anything serious in a while

[03:54:01] <ska> If there are some quirks with getting hardware working, notes are useful. For example the backlit display.
[03:54:19] <sussudio> in what way
[03:54:39] <sussudio> aren't all displays backlit
[03:54:48] <ska> No idea, I just like to know if something will work properly with my favorite distro before I buy it.

[12:39:19] <Khepra> Haohmaru: no idea about synaptic behaviour, but this happens with apt when you have local folder repos and the _apt user has no permission to reach the packages, so it retries as root
[12:39:47] <Haohmaru> local folder repos?!
[12:39:50] <Khepra> looks like that seems to be the case here too, but the question is, why's anything tried from /root/.synaptic/
[12:40:03] <Khepra> Haohmaru: yea, stuff like file:/// urls in sources.list

[12:41:21] <Khepra> Haohmaru: that's the part where I don't know what synaptic does, and this seems like some kind of cache is (re)used
[12:41:31] <Haohmaru> hm
[12:41:51] <Haohmaru> in any case, the operations via synaptic work, despite the "errors"

[12:43:03] <Haohmaru> i mean.. it does run as root, but i launch it via the normal user, which then asks for password..
[12:43:10] <Haohmaru> i may have local .deb files
[12:43:20] <Khepra> even with sudo apt install /home/somepackage.deb, that initial uid=0 privseps to _apt that in turn cannot fetch from /home/

[12:44:35] <Khepra> Haohmaru: the package manager must run as root of course, but the download stage doesn't. so the question is why is it trying something that looks like a local cache, from /root/ 's  $HOME
[12:45:26] <Haohmaru> this error in particular now happened iirc after i did "Reload", and then "Mark All Upgrades"
[12:47:49] <Haohmaru> i just checked, i think there are no "sketchy" packages right now.. i *have* installed some old gtk themes which were deprecated or something, so i probably did that with gdebi, but i guess i've thrown them away during 10 -> 11

[20:14:32] <kyle__> rendar: I think it is.  But I've only noticed that behavior on laptops.

[20:14:47] * kyle__ thinks
[20:15:11] <kyle__> Could be the type of display.  IE a TV might not support all the same HDMI/DP features that a dedicated computer monitor does.
[20:15:24] <Khepra> well laptops, that's why I asked if it were a laptop. assuming maybe there's that transformer whatsitcalled optimus prime autobot thingmajing that would erroneously switch res with "wrong" display used, without proper software support.

[20:16:03] <rendar> so the turning on TV is beneficial to the machine
[20:16:15] <kyle__> rendar: Yes.  Because it's powered on enough to report back what resolutions it supports.
[20:16:41] <Khepra> wait, when the tv is off, where do you have low res?
[20:16:43] <rendar> kyle__, right, but .. maximum resolution of 1024x768 if no monitor is connected? really?
[20:16:54] <rendar> that's VERY low!

[20:17:38] <kyle__> rendar: I'm guessing that's a default in the video card, or just what the tv reports when it's in a low poer mode.  But sussudio's suggestion might be better.

[20:18:54] <rendar> Khepra, no..

[20:19:16] <rendar> i can see it with xrandr

[20:19:22] <rendar> no, in the system!
[20:19:41] <jmcnaught> even after the TV is turned on the resolution is still 1024x768?
[20:19:51] <rendar> nope
[20:19:58] <rendar> it becomes 1920x1080
[20:20:09] <rendar> automagically
[20:20:15] <jmcnaught> So you are complaining that VNC is limited to 1024x768?  Or what is the problem?
[20:20:42] <rendar> jmcnaught, the problem is that even the machine boots without a powered on monitor/tv, i should get higher resolutions as default
[20:20:45] <Khepra> maybe you could try forcing hd1080 via xorg.conf
[20:20:51] <rendar> 1024x768 is TOO LOW

[20:21:29] <rendar> Khepra, when no monitor is connected, Xorg starts anyway, i can see the processes through ssh
[20:21:29] <jmcnaught> rendar: your complaint is that before the TV is powered on xrandr reports a lower resolution than you would like, but it works properly once the TV is on?
[20:21:40] <rendar> jmcnaught, basically yes

[20:25:58] <Khepra> doesn't the vnc cliend side window resize everyhting? like vboxdrv resolution does as you resize the host side window
[20:26:05] <jelly> no
[20:26:18] <Khepra> can the res be forced via vnc server?
[20:26:59] <jelly> my question would be, if you're using vnc, why not use a standalone vnc server and a separate sessoin
[20:27:51] <rendar> Khepra, yes i think i could do that
[20:28:16] <rendar> jelly, that would be very interesting
[20:28:30] <rendar> jelly, you mean like another display?
[20:29:41] <jelly> rendar, vnc servers on unix used to work by setting up a completely separate X server session

[22:58:49] <jjakob> I installed s-nail, is there a package or way to make /usr/bin/mail point to it? (I could do it manually but maybe there's a better way?)

[22:59:14] <johnfg> Hi folks.
[22:59:30] <jjakob> /etc/smartmontools/run.d/10mail expects there to be a /usr/bin/mail or it won't work.
[23:00:06] <johnfg> I removed a docker container a bit ago.  I noticed that I have /usr/share/osinfo that's remaining.  Is this a directory used by bullseye at all, or was it created by docker?

[23:01:52] <jjakob> maybe it's provided by osinfo-db, did you uninstall docker and osinfo-db?
[23:01:53] <Khepra> johnfg: aparently it belongs to the osinfo-db package
[23:02:20] <Khepra> jjakob: you could symlink it, providing it offers the same API that smartd expects
[23:02:25] <jjakob> usually I purge when I really don't want things left laying around. apt-get autoremove --purge
[23:02:43] <johnfg> Not specifically, but it may have been done by homebrew or ddev; not sure.
[23:04:12] *** Joins: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[23:04:23] <Khepra> jjakob: but then, just write a s-nail handler in that directory. you can copy from 10mail

[23:05:13] <jjakob> johnfg: that's not a directpry created by a container, it's a package that's a dependency of something installed on the host
[23:05:19] <johnfg> What's the command to find out what program is using osinfo-db?  And no, I didn't remove docker, just the 1 image.
[23:05:41] <cosimone> johnfg: try "aptitude why osinfo-db"
[23:05:41] <jjakob> Khepra: I could modify it to just use s-nail, it's just a couple of lines
[23:05:42] <johnfg> jjakob: Ok, that makes sense.
[23:06:04] <Khepra> jjakob: you don't even have to modify it, just copy to 99my-s-nail or whatever, and then modify that

[23:06:56] <jjakob> I thought there would be a way to select it, like with alternatives
[23:09:32] <Khepra> jjakob: the entire smartd-runner framework allows you to do whatever triggers you want in that directory; that's way more flexible and usable than limiting just to an alternatives selector for single function
[23:09:49] <jjakob> not that, for /usr/bin/mail

[23:19:08] <jjakob> looking at this again, why is that script even there, smartmontools/run.d isn't anywhere in the man pages
[23:19:23] <jjakob> there is the -m option which sends mail
[23:21:08] <jjakob> oh right, -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner
[23:21:08] <Khepra> jjakob: the stuff in that dir is exec'd as run-part by /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner which is configured to be run on failure by default smartd.conf
[23:21:47] <Khepra> so the framework exists for you to define whatever trigger you want
