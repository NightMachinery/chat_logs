[02:29:32] <hashfunc803> is it possible to jump back to the beginning of a loop if a certain condition is met?
[02:29:46] <hashfunc803> meaning in pseudo-code:
[02:30:00] *** Quits: xaltsc (~xaltsc@user/xaltsc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:31:22] <hashfunc803> (loop :until (condition) :do ((lambda (x)) (if x (jump-to-beginning-of-loop (pop list-of-thinigs))) (list-of-things)))
[02:37:14] <random-nick> I don't think loop has such a feature
[02:38:00] <random-nick> but in that specific case, why not use the list iteration clause
[02:38:20] <hashfunc803> random-nick: doing some further research and it's looking like GO or TAGBODY might do the trick, but i think i may have a bad design if i have to resort to those
[02:38:21] <random-nick> :for x :in list-of-things :until (condition)
[02:38:23] <random-nick> etc.

[02:38:50] <hashfunc803> random-nick: i look into that
[02:38:52] <hashfunc803> thanks
[02:39:22] <random-nick> GO and TAGBODY will let you move inside the loop clause or exit the loop altogether (either above or below)
[02:39:40] <|3b|> if it isn't too complicated, sometimes you can just put "the rest of the loop" in a separate DO, and guard that with WHEN or UNLESS
[02:39:56] <random-nick> but LOOP doesn't give you labels for the iteration code you can GO to
[02:40:10] <|3b|> (loop ... do (stuff) unless x do (rest of stuff))
[02:40:38] <random-nick> there's also DO if you don't need LOOP's advanced features
[02:41:14] <hashfunc803> ok thanks ya'll
[02:43:29] <random-nick> oh, I above I meant to day
[02:43:45] <random-nick> GO and TAGBODY will let you move inside the :DO clause
[02:43:53] <random-nick> say*
[02:47:56] <aeth> DO has an implicit tagbody
[02:48:02] <aeth> so DO can do everything
[02:49:56] <random-nick> TAGBODY has an explicit tagbody
[02:50:07] <random-nick> so it can also do everything
[02:53:42] <hashfunc803> alright if i think i figured out an approach
[02:53:57] <hashfunc803> another question, is if there's a function that returns the item removed from a list?
[02:54:09] <hashfunc803> meaining in pseudo-code:
[02:54:32] <hashfunc803> (remove 3 '(1 2 3 4 5)) => 3
[02:55:11] <hashfunc803> with the side-effect on the list being => '(1 2 4 5)

[03:03:13] <White_Flame> so if some binding held (1 2 3 4 5), and you did (delete 1 my-list), my-list would still reference the original cons cell, and likely still hold (1 2 3 4 5), while DELETE might return just the 2nd cons cell onward for (2 3 4 5)

But I want to know more about how agnostic-lizard works so that I can stick in a paragraph for it in the paper.  And I am working on my invited ELS talk, but there is no deadline for that, other than ELS of course.

[08:05:46] <jeosol> Regarding ELS, next year, which should be in person, I guess. My project is done now, so i should have more time ahead to write the paper. It's always stressful living it close to deadline then I procrastinate again -- to much work.

[08:15:17] <beach> jeosol: Remind me of the project that is now done?
[08:18:07] <jeosol> Yeah, it's an integrated application I was building over last 4-5 years. It mostly for doing physics simulation (via 3rd partly software). The CL does all the process, writing files, submitting jobs (in parallel). It also has several optimization algorithms for making optimal decisions. The last part was getting this to work through HTTP request:
[08:18:08] <jeosol> call hunchentoot server, that then fires the rest of the CL application.
[08:18:24] <jeosol> I apologize if all that is convoluted.
[08:19:26] <jeosol> I have asked questions here over the years from how to layer and organize CLOS classes in large projects to other minute CL parts
[08:20:38] <beach> Right.  Thanks for the reminder.
[08:20:40] <jeosol> Hopefully, I will do a better job with a write. I am just setting up demo . Though the thing with the project, a user will normally not interact with the CL side as you just make a HTTP request - at least for the exposed parts
[08:21:22] <jeosol> beach: I am documenting the project now with little write ups (.md files and .py and .cl notebooks)
[08:21:53] <jeosol> beach: you are welcome
[08:22:02] <beach> I see.  So the plan is to write a paper about it, and submit to ELS'23?
[08:22:17] <jeosol> beach: I'll definitely use some review from you and the other guys here to get a good paper
[08:22:25] <jeosol> beach: Yes, that's correct. ELS '23
[08:22:34] <beach> Sounds good.
[08:22:46] <jeosol> I had too much on my hands. I actually started it but other commitments just made it difficult to be able to push it through

[11:37:25] <hashfunc803> the warning: "WARNING: redefining PACKAGE::SOMETHING in DEFUN"
[11:37:53] <hashfunc803> or better yet, getting the return value of EVAL without _actually_ evaluating the form
[11:38:36] <beach> Getting the return value of EVAL without evaluating the form would be undecidable.
[11:38:38] <White_Flame> (setf (fdefinition 'something) (lambda ...))
[11:38:54] <White_Flame> but that assumes you're not doing DEFUN again
[11:39:50] <hashfunc803> White_Flame: i like that strategy. i could perhaps save the FDEFINITION in a temporary variable and then restore?
[11:40:27] <White_Flame> that would be possible
[11:40:39] <hashfunc803> White_Flame: awesome. i think i'm going to try that
[11:40:51] <hashfunc803> beach: White_Flame: thanks
[11:41:02] <White_Flame> could be a problem when other functions in the compiation unit bind too tightly
[11:41:29] <White_Flame> and would still refer to the old definition, but I'm not an expert on when that happens
[11:41:35] <White_Flame> obviously don't declare it inline either :-P
[11:42:22] <White_Flame> #'foo will also grab the function at its evaluation time, while passing 'foo as a function will look it up on the symbol every time
[11:42:35] <White_Flame> *every time that it's funcalled/applied
[11:43:38] <White_Flame> so there's lots of edge issues depending on what you're doing.  It can be much easier to just explicitly use function objects for certain dynamic stituations

[11:58:50] <beach> dbotton: The indentation of the body of your FACTORIAL function is incorrect, and since you are using ZEROP, you might want to use 1- as well.
[11:59:51] <beach> dbotton: The name of the language is written "Common Lisp" and not "common lisp".
[12:01:03] <beach> dbotton: And the name of the general language family is written "Lisp", and not "lisp".
[12:02:09] <beach> dbotton: In an S-expression, the opening parenthesis is usually not followed by a function.  It is followed by the name of an operator, and that operator may be a function or something else.
[12:03:37] <beach> dbotton: (list 1 2 3) "is" not a list of three elements, but four.  I suggest you be more careful from the start with the distinction between a form and what that form evaluates to.
[12:04:25] <beach> dbotton: And I suggest being more careful about complete sentences.
[12:06:05] <beach> dbotton: "ie" -> "i.e."
[12:07:51] <beach> dbotton: The tortoise doesn't win the hare, it might win "over" the hare.
[12:09:40] <beach> dbotton: Your punctuation is off in several sentences.  But it is hard to tell what is deliberate style on your part and what are mistakes.
[12:12:03] <beach> dbotton: It is strange to say "operators and functions" since a function is also an operator.
[12:13:09] <lisp123> Maybe special operators, macros and functions would be better there
[12:13:24] <lisp123> special forms*
[12:14:20] <beach> I think just "operator" is fine.  Otherwise, you will introduce too much stuff too early.
[12:15:22] <lisp123> T
[12:16:10] <beach> I don't much like that style of writing, but then, I am not part of the target group for this text.
[12:20:57] <lisp123> Yeah I think its for a different target audience - sometimes the informality helps there (all the above comments are good btw)
[12:21:56] <lisp123> Of all the Lisp authors, I prefer GJS the most
[12:22:02] <lisp123> and yours ;)
[12:22:18] <beach> Thanks.  And informal is OK with me for some other target group, but when the informal style is also incorrect, like in Land of Lisp, I can no longer approve.
