[03:30:28] <phf-1> Hi! I can read on this channel description: "Most wallets sell your info and lie". Which do not? More generally, is there a "Bitcoin How To" which can be trusted somewhere?
[03:31:30] <grundle> non-custodial wallets won't :)
[03:31:55] <Nachlader> safest way is to keep your keys on a computer with no internet connection
[03:32:01] <grundle> a popular saying is "not your keys, not your crypto"
[03:32:03] <Nachlader> and then that computer inside a large safe
[03:32:15] <grundle> then bury that safe on an island

[03:33:10] <phf-1> Ok, will do that, thanks!
[03:33:17] <Nachlader> impressive
[03:34:38] <grundle> phf-1 i'd just go with the bitcoin core wallet.  it lets you make descriptor or legacy wallets.  if you're worried about the size of the blockchain you can always have it prune to a certain size
[03:37:55] <phf-1> Yes, I guess it's the safest option for a small amount. Thanks!

[19:36:23] <bitcoinpizza> ANNOUNCEMENT: we at hrf.org selling pizzas for "human rights" with Iraqi veteran Anthony Pompliano. We believe that our "bitcoin pizza" scam will mislead enough people to give us some Bitcoin. Ohh, and you can only pay for our pizzas with credit card, no Bitcoin accepted. Eat pizza and support hrf.org in massacring people. Oh yeah.
[19:43:15] <Inge> A bunch of Norwegian academics were quite skeptical of HRF - but have yet to see any of the evidence from this gaggle of Norwegian investigative journalists
[19:44:05] <bitcoinpizza> seriously guys, excuse me for being rude, but for ffs, how many did fall for this scam by Alex Gladstein and hrf.org? guys, show me any article written by these scammers prior to December 28, 2018. There is NONE. So don't you call me and my associates scammers because Gladstein say so in Twitter. He is a scammer. Our organization uses the
[19:44:06] <bitcoinpizza> 18fyEQXaZQgCbNoE5Qjs6W7Pnqc9Yp4PQD bitcoin address for years and we do help asylum seekers with all the funds. Gladstein and hrf.org is just a scam, with 0 transactions on blockchain, nor it is transparent. They failed to bully me for 6 years and than the "startegy officer" decided to become a superhero for bitcoin and human rights. At one point
[19:44:06] <bitcoinpizza> Gladstein sent an article to the blog.torproject.org for which I complained to Tor Project and they added a disclaimer to that article.
[19:46:03] <bitcoinpizza> Inge everything written by those journalists in Norway is true and can be verified pretty easily. Do you have any specific question? I'm more than happy to provide you the evidence.

[21:13:33] <belcher> ;;ask
[21:13:33] <gribble> Don't ask to ask (to ask...), just ask your question!
[21:14:04] <WS_black22> i got my old wallet.dat i need to imported to the new bitcoin core, how can i do this? i dont see the replasment of wallet.dat
[21:14:56] <belcher> try placing it in the data directory in the wallet directory, and then add `wallet=yourwalletname.dat` to the bitcoin.conf file, then restart core
[21:15:17] <belcher> you'd likely see other wallets there (although recent versions of core no longer create a new empty wallet on startup)
[21:16:01] <WS_black22> i have only 2 folders inside bitcoin directory

[21:33:28] <Guest31> Hopefully not too off-topic: I've decided to finally cash in my fork coins (Cash, Gold, SV, Diamond) and buy more BTC. What wallet(s) would you recommend? It has to be light, non-custodial, open source, and capable of bulk private key imports. Atomic Wallet and Exodus can't do proper bulk imports, so they're not an option.

[21:42:45] <dodo> Guest31: you can also ask in #bitcoin-forks, not sure how active it is any more, but they should know how to claim them
[21:42:53] <s17> I used Coinomi
[21:43:30] <Guest31> Yeah, I've moved everything but the dust already. The fork claimer seems risky for a relative novice, but I'll look into it.
[21:43:43] <s17> but I did not use the fork claimer, I think I just did it all manually -- dumped privkeys from the respective wallet and then imported
