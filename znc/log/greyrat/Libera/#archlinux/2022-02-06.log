[01:04:28] <simplycorbett> It should be? I'm running gnome on the main user and using su - to go into the other user.
[01:04:50] <simplycorbett> they're also in the video group
[01:04:52] <MrElendig> you have to pass along DISPLAY, set up secutrity etc

[04:59:35] <kevr> TheArcaneBrony: Also, instead of cp, you can use the `install` application with the -D flag, which takes care of creating missing directories.
[04:59:53] <kevr> removes the need for mkdir
[05:00:05] <kevr> and it also lets you set permissions at the same time.
[05:01:29] <kevr> last thing and i'll shut up: you probably want to wrap $srcdir and $pkgdir in quotes, in case the user is building in a path with spaces.

[09:05:58] <RendySurvage> I have this strange issue where my apache server (not currently allowed outside my network) doesn't have a server.crt or server.key. I'm not sure how this could have happened or if that's the default. I'm following weakdh.org's guide but I don't have a crt. I don't want to do this wrong so I'm wondering if it's fine to just generate a 2048 bit key and append my .pem to that file.

[09:08:51] <RendySurvage> You know what.....I should rethink this.
[09:08:53] <NintendEef> oh yeah then in that case you can just create and sign your own crt and key
[09:10:54] <RendySurvage> Anything worth doing is worth doing right. So....adapt.
[09:11:13] <alloy> cyphertite it takes about that long on my new elitebook too
[09:11:50] <cyphertite> alloy:  right, it's normal behavior

[09:12:38] <alloy> why is it normal for 10 seconds to decrypt the tiny /boot partition and less time for the 1tb main partition, doesn't make sense

[09:13:00] <masoudd> RendySurvage, There are free options like letsencrypt

[09:14:09] <NintendEef> mansoudd: if RendySurvage doesnt want the server exposed to the internet then letsencrypt is not viable as it requires you to verify your ip to get a crt

[12:04:28] <mbuf> I fixed the GUI login issue. After the upgrade, lightdm was not showing up, and when I manually did "systemctl restart lightdm", it showed up. Permanent fix was to set "login-check-graphical=true" in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf as stated in https://www.debugpoint.com/2021/03/failed-to-start-lightdm/.

[17:15:37] <Ballerburg9005> that's not true, pacman-key --refresh-keys pulls from keyservers
[17:15:53] <Namarrgon> you shouldn't be running this as all the keys are in the keyring
[17:18:42] <Ballerburg9005> Namarrgon: I will try running it after pacman -Syu now, but I can tell you from experience that you rather need to run pacman-key --refresh-keys first
[17:18:59] <Namarrgon> in which scenario?
[17:19:06] <Ballerburg9005> upgrade
[17:19:22] <Namarrgon> update the keyring package first, then -Su, as MrElendig suggested above

[17:22:08] <Ballerburg9005> "error reading key: No data"
[17:22:17] <Namarrgon> which command gave you that?
[17:22:32] <Ballerburg9005>  pacman-key --refresh-keys
[17:22:40] <MrElendig> don't run that in the first place?
[17:22:42] <Namarrgon> why are you running that in the first place?
[17:23:14] <Ballerburg9005> because it tells me I can't install packages because of missing/invalid? keys

[17:24:56] <Ballerburg9005> like I said, from experience you need to do  pacman-key --refresh-keys after having deleted the key database, even if you install archlinux-keyring
[17:24:59] <MrElendig> Ballerburg9005: updating the keyring first solves that, unless you have completely broken your existing keyring

[20:32:40] <Ballerburg9005> ok, so I was asking earlier how I can reinitialize the keyring after it has been deleted and that if I follow all the suggested steps through I will get those "error reading key: No data"

[20:39:11] <Ballerburg9005> I believe in order to properly reinitialize the keyring, I have to run the refresh-keys command. But the command currently is riddled with odd errors

[21:34:21] <deschain> Hi! I've been having some trouble with my wireless scanner, was hoping someone could help. It's an HP MFP printer - printing works just fine, scanning unfortunately does not. I have sane-airscan installed, and when I run `scanimage -L`, multiple backends are listed. However, when I try to specify a backend, I get `Error during device I/O`. Also no dice with `hp-scan`.
[21:35:14] <deschain> `hp-scan` tells me "error: SANE: Invalid argument (code=4)"

[23:43:00] <grawity> youtube has anti-download throttling
[23:43:01] <demonicmaniac1> because google is actively throttling youtube-dl

[23:43:24] <demonicmaniac1> ytdlp does a hacky using android player interface to avoid detection and throttling
[23:43:29] <grawity> youtube-dl couldn't incorporate (because they don't want dependencies IIRC) but the yt-dlp fork could

[23:43:45] <xanderle> going to remember that for life
[23:43:58] <xanderle> mpv --hwdec=vaapi ./downloadefile works (i see image so i assume its working)
[23:44:09] <grawity> iirc they managed to outright reverse-engineer the javascript code that produces the "unthrottled" URLs in browsers
[23:44:27] <grawity> but it couldn't be integrated into youtube-dl's handrolled JS thing
[23:45:07] *** djabonas is now known as diabonas|W
