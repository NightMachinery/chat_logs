[00:09:01] <nicechuky> which is your favorite freevpn?
[00:14:45] <rob0> I never wanted/needed something like that.

[01:34:41] <BtbN> Even a paid VPN is usually a scam in the best case.
[01:34:47] <BtbN> A free one is just all around a horrible idea

[01:54:34] <xx> BtbN: then let's start our own paid vpn, you in?
[01:54:48] <BtbN> To scam more people or what?
[01:54:55] <xx> no, to make money
[01:55:07] <xx> but we're gonna be the ones who don't scam
[01:55:10] <BtbN> By scamming people who believe the VPN is providing them any value
[01:55:26] <BtbN> Well, if you don't scam people, they don't give you money. That's kind of the whole idea.
[01:55:36] <xx> it's providing value to me - my ISP likes to hijack http requests to add advertisement banners
[01:56:20] <BtbN> Don't use http in 2021, problem solved.
[01:56:26] <xx> they also hijack dns requests to redirect nxdomain requests to their advertisement portal
[01:56:27] <xx> etc.
[01:56:46] <xx> overall a VPN protects me against my ISP
[01:56:52] <xx> but I'm a very specific case
[01:57:32] <BtbN> Use Google DNS or something then. Or some other alternative DNS provider.
[01:57:45] <xx> it *hijacks* dns
[01:57:55] <xx> i.e. every request to 53/udp gets rewritten
[01:58:36] <BtbN> Time for a new ISP then.
[01:59:01] <xx> only 1 ISP in this city
[01:59:08] <BtbN> Whole new city then
[01:59:15] <BtbN> or maybe even country if they allow that kind of monopoly
[01:59:41] <xx> there's too little profit to be made for any competitor to move in
[02:00:01] <xx> starlink might be the solution eventually

[02:25:21] <UncleKiwi> greetings
[02:25:36] <UncleKiwi> openvpn is great
[02:27:18] <UncleKiwi> im just curious if there might be a way that I can easily keep an easy to read audit log of devices connections/dissconect/connected etc
[02:32:37] <BtbN> It logs connections by default, to whatever your systems logger is, or to somewhere in /var/log.
[02:33:23] <UncleKiwi> yep I see that 
[02:33:30] <UncleKiwi> but its quite noisey 
[02:34:26] <UncleKiwi> the status log is cool

[02:36:48] <UncleKiwi> i am mostly connecting devices that dont accomodate the ta.key - is there a way that I can append that to the client.conf file
[02:36:54] <UncleKiwi> or is that a bad idea
[02:37:29] <UncleKiwi> to try to get tls-auth
[02:40:42] <UncleKiwi> is it mauch of a risk not using tls-auth
[02:40:48] <UncleKiwi> *much
[02:40:57] <xx> use tls-crypt
[02:41:07] <xx> v2 if you want each user to have a separate file
[02:42:45] <UncleKiwi> xx: sounds interesting 
[02:43:06] <UncleKiwi> im just not sure how some of these devices can even take advantage 
[02:43:10] <UncleKiwi> I dont think they can 
[02:43:17] <UncleKiwi> im using a fanvil i12
[02:43:49] <xx> no idea what that is, but you can have the tls-crypt.key inside the client.conf file using the <tls-crypt>xxxxx</tls-crypt> tags
[02:44:03] <UncleKiwi> nice thanks xx
[02:44:17] <UncleKiwi> yeah I thought that was possible
[02:44:23] <UncleKiwi> i'll give it a try 
[02:44:54] <xx> <tls-crypt>-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----\n-----END OpenVPN Static key V1-----</tls-crypt>
[02:46:04] <UncleKiwi> tls-auth vs tls-crypt 
[02:46:26] <UncleKiwi> why would I pick one over the other
[02:46:36] <xx> just pick tls-crypt, forget tls-auth exists
