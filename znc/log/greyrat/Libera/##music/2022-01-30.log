[00:20:26] <artao> but at least it works in Cakewalk now. And OBS. I can always use that as a fallback
[00:20:51] <artao> ReaInsert is for sending signal out to hardware then back into Reaper

[07:20:14] <artao> still need to incorporate changing parameters on the synths
[07:21:23] <artao> I was watching this guy earlier on Telecom Electric Beats talking about his production process, and how he'll just lay down a 2-track mix of everything all together, right out of the mixer's master buss

[07:24:27] <artao> oddly ... the basline wasn't discordant this time. hmm
[07:24:55] <artao> the bassline is the Neutron. all analog. when setting this up i spent at least 30 min trying to tune the Neutron to the other synths

[07:31:06] <artao> what's waveform?

[08:47:46] <artao> once it's warmed up, if you turn it off and back on it tunes itself. HOWEVER! There's no "notes" per se. just a knob to sweep thru frequencies
[08:47:46] <murthy> louipc: checking
[08:48:03] <artao> so it still has to be tuned to other instruments (of A=440)

[08:48:13] <artao> i can't answer in that detail murthy
