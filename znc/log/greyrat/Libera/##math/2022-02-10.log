[03:53:05] <isekaijin> Free monoids aren't constructed as Cartesian products.
[03:53:40] <isekaijin> For example, if I'm working with the tuple (a,b,c), I might consider the question of whether it's equal to the tuple (x,y,z). But comparing it to the tuple (p,q,r,s) is nonsense.
[03:53:48] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: so you insist it's best that we have two notations for the same thing, despite you could figure out from context what it is. At the same time you insist it's good we have one notation for two things (multiplication and function application)
[03:54:05] <isekaijin> However, if I'm working with the list [a,b,c], then comparing it to both tuples [x,y,z] and [p,q,r,s] makes sense.

[03:54:51] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: Again, in most situations, you use different letters for first-order and higher-order functions.

[03:55:19] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: in both cases there's no equivalence.
[03:56:14] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: By “nonsense”, I mean “it doesn't even make to sense to consider the question of whether it's true or not”. When I compare two objects, it's usually a given that they belong to a common collection.

[03:59:10] <Z-module> How about boldface capital Cyrillic letters (the ones not already Roman) exclusively for sub-subscript indices.
[03:59:28] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: But this dissatisfaction comes from actual practical experience writing proofs.
[04:00:03] <isekaijin> When I can introduce a notational change that will shorten a proof or make it clearer or whatever, I just up and introduce it.
[04:00:27] <isekaijin> (In a way that other mathematicians will still understand.)

[04:04:22] <isekaijin> In 2022, we don't yet have a proof assistant that's appropriate for working “natively” in the category of quasicoherent modules over a scheme.
[04:04:55] <isekaijin> Proof assistants have very bare bones, “general purpose” logics.

[04:14:13] <isekaijin> Does it tell you which one succeeded?
[04:14:29] <Galois> some of them do, for example info_auto tells you how auto worked
[04:14:43] <Galois> in the worst case you can always print out your proof term, small comfort that is
[04:14:48] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: a good language is extensible via its library. So I guess you want maybe something that is not split into "built-in logic" and "library" as two distinct features that only touch in places
[04:14:54] <Galois> it's like how a lot of LaTeX commands happen behind the scenes when you type \usepackage{tikz}
[04:15:20] <Panther> If at first you don't succeed, keep on sucking until you do succeed. :)
[04:15:34] <Galois> and you don't particularly need to know how or what those commands are. You can argue semantics: is tikz built into the LaTeX core?
[04:16:09] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: My experience with extensible languages (e.g. Lisp, Ruby, etc.) suggests that maybe language extensibility isn't such a good idea.
[04:16:48] <Galois> in the worst case you can always write a compiler for a new language extension in the old language, so everything turing complete is extensible?
[04:17:38] <isekaijin> Galois: It isn't a language extension if you need to port your old code to the new language before you can use it with code written in the new language.
[04:18:13] <Galois> "port" is a somewhat subjective concept. Do you port C code to C++?
[04:19:24] <isekaijin> You can link C++ programs to C libraries, but actually compiling C code with a C++ compiler sometimes requires doing some porting work, yes.
[04:19:42] <Galois> usually just adding a bunch of extern "C"'s
[04:20:35] <isekaijin> You're assuming that you're using a compiler that bends over backwards to try to reconcile the incompatibilities between C and C++,.
[04:20:42] <Galois> anyway if you call that porting then by your definition C++ isn't an extension of C. But the wikipedia page for C++ starts off in the first sentence saying C++ is an extension of C.
[04:22:20] <isekaijin> Just adding “extern "C"” isn't that much work, of course. But C has constructs that aren't legal C++.
[04:22:47] <isekaijin> The most obvious one is that C is a lot laxer than C++ with implicit casts.
[04:23:11] <Galois> the point is that at least some people disagree with you. There is at least a sizable contingent that regards C++ as an extension of C, and if this counts, then pretty much any language can be extended in this sense.

[05:11:48] <isekaijin> pendarsoheil: I'm having trouble figuring out what you mean. “Transposing” a matrix is an operation that gives you another matrix.
[05:12:37] <isekaijin> (More precisely, the transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping the roles of rows and columns.)
[05:13:48] <Decker> pick one of the rows as a normal to the plane, and fill in two other perpendicular unit vectors on the plane ?
[05:15:13] <isekaijin> The way the question was phrased, it seemed like the plane was a given.
[05:15:34] <Decker> so maybe fitting a matrix to represent the plane?
[05:15:37] <isekaijin> If you're given a fixed plane and a fixed vector, you can't arbitrarily decree that the vector is perpendicular to the plane.
[05:15:50] <isekaijin> Why would you need a matrix to represent a plane?
[05:16:04] <Decker> because it's a 2d shooter on a 3d wall ?

[07:54:03] <ProfSimm> I'm unsure what infinity is a tool for
[07:54:19] <isekaijin> But, in a sense, they aren't “real infinities”. They only look like points at infinity in a particular coordinate system.

[07:55:35] <ProfSimm> We have no evidence for infinity being real, and such evidence is uncollectable
[07:55:39] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: fair

[12:06:30] <drazak> and bob's your uncle

[12:07:44] <alphamule> Even if there was one for a given configuration (with variables for each resistor value), it would be pointless as resistors aren't generally more accurate than fraction of a percent, even for the expensive ones.

[12:10:22] <drazak> I think for DC they can just compute, in general
[12:10:26] <alphamule> Ah
[12:10:30] <drazak> no monte-carlo necessary

[15:43:35] <isekaijin> The one used in projective geometry isn't the same as the one used in measure theory, and neither of these two is the one used in set theory, etc.

[15:44:57] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: I wanna see what's the common theme, given they have a common name (i.e. "infinity")
[15:45:04] <isekaijin> lol
[15:45:17] <int-e> There is a threshold, fo course... the set of all natural numbers is infinite, but all its members are finite.
[15:45:39] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: common theme appears to be setting a "direction" vector of something and unwilling to constrain yourself in the length of the vector
[15:46:16] <int-e> Well, the infinities in the one-point compactification of the reals or the projective plane are very different from an infinite set.
[15:47:18] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: That doesn't work for infinite setse.
[15:47:21] <isekaijin> sets*
[15:47:49] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: give an example of an infinite set
[15:47:51] <int-e> (There are connections on an intuitive level, when you treat cardinalities as numbers, and embed numbers in the reals (as far as they go)... but mathematically it's better treat these concepts as separate.)
[15:47:56] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: Sure, the real numbers.
[15:48:18] <int-e> The real number thing breaks down once you go beyond aleph_0.

[15:49:19] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: I guess the common theme is that there are things you want to consider “number-like”, and “infinity” is anything that you want to consider alongside “number-like” objects, but is too large (in set theory or measure theory) or too far (in projective geometry) to be itself “number-like”.
[15:49:27] <int-e> (enter surreal numbers)
[15:49:28] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: the countable infinity of a real set is like a vector with no length. And the infinite subdivision of reals is just a proof that reals are a shitty metaphor :P
[15:49:35] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: That's just nonsense.
[15:49:47] <isekaijin> “like a vector with no length”... rofl
[15:50:08] <isekaijin> Anyhow.
[15:50:10] <ProfSimm> isekaijin: well 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. What is this. Vector +1 with infinite application steps
[15:50:14] <isekaijin> rofl
[15:50:16] <int-e> This is an example of a non-transferrable intuition ;-)
[15:50:46] <isekaijin> ProfSimm: You're a programmer, right? Because you seem to think that vectors are tuples or something.
[15:50:55] <int-e> (Sounds much more polite than "you're wrong" doesn't it?)
[15:51:12] <ProfSimm> Everyone is a programmer these days
[15:51:31] <int-e> not really
[15:51:32] <isekaijin> Speak for yourself, but okay.
[15:51:51] <Franciman> everyone should know programming, these days
[15:51:53] <Franciman> it's useful
[15:52:05] <Franciman> well more than programming, how these IT tech work
[15:52:28] <int-e> Yes, but many don't, unless you count "programming" a digital video recorder.

[16:14:05] <Franciman> can I get P^2(R) as the alexandroff compactification of R^2 ?
[16:14:17] <isekaijin> No.
[16:14:27] <Franciman> i don't think so, because i have to add a whole plane ?
[16:14:30] <Franciman> err
[16:14:31] <isekaijin> The Alexandroff compactification of R^n is S^n.
[16:14:33] <Franciman> a whole line*

[16:14:45] <isekaijin> But PR^2 isn't even orientable.
[16:14:47] <isekaijin> yeah.
[16:15:00] <Franciman> isekaijin: is there a compactification which adds a line?
[16:15:06] <PlanckWalk> Alexandroff compactification is always a single extra point.
[16:15:32] <isekaijin> Franciman: Mmm, in a canonical way? Not that I know of.
[16:15:49] <isekaijin> Besides, PR^2 adds a projective line. So, topologically, you're adding a circle.

[19:45:57] <isekaijin> https://pastebin.com/Fa0m9ZjZ
[19:45:58] <sek> that'll get rid of the sqrt{2} factor. Then your task is to show what you end up with is irreducible, and one way to do it is as isekaijin says: write down all roots and take all products and show none are over Q

[19:51:10] <sek> so now you need to show this is irreducible over Q
[19:51:26] <sek> there are a few options. First you could do a rational roots test to see if there are any linear factors
[19:51:56] <sek> 2nd you could try writting it as (x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d) and see if you can get a contradiction with the relations you end up
[19:52:09] <isekaijin> The way I constructed it literally rules out any linear factors. So you only need to handle the two quadratic factors case.

[20:02:07] <isekaijin> It's the other way around. Clearly a polynomial whose roots are \pm sqrt(2) \pm i has coefficients in Q, because it's invariant under swapping \pm sqrt(2) and also invariant under swapping \pm i.

[21:47:10] <dude12312414> because that was the only way i could think of someone mistaking 'donations' for 'values'
[21:47:16] <percentilegentil> The functions are self explanatory, but the C: value is my range. Simply counting each cell (not the value, just the existence of it) if it's above or below my percentiles.
[21:47:38] <percentilegentil> In theory, shouldn't it be 82259?
[21:47:57] <joel135> i don't know excel, sorry
[21:48:05] <percentilegentil> Ok, thanks for trying :)

[21:50:39] <dude12312414> in theory you could have values at exactly 0.75, so you should use <= or >= in one of the cases
[21:50:55] <percentilegentil> Let me try that...

[21:52:08] <percentilegentil> Oh hey that worked!
