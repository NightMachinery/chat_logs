[23:55:27] <wroathe> So I'm putting together a proposal for an organization that I think will resist the idea of using Kubernetes or any form of immutable infrastructure. In the past when I've set up tooling for a team managing environments comprised of mutable infrastructure I've used Octopus Deploy to manage package deployments to that team's environments. It has a nice GUI for showing off currently deployed package 
[23:55:33] <wroathe> versions at a glance in each environment, and you can drill down further to see the history and dates of deployments for each machine and each package. The choice to use Octopus Deploy wasn't one that I made, and I've since wondered what alternatives are out there that offer a similiar web UI experience?
[23:55:59] <wroathe> At the time I was also evaluating Chef, Ansible, and Puppet, but during my evaluation I didn't see any nice GUIs that would let me use them in a similar way as a point and click "environment manager"
[23:56:11] <wroathe> So what tools have you guys used for this in the past? 
[23:57:32] <wroathe> CI tools can be used for this purpose, but a few years back when I was doing this it seemed like Teamcity and Jenkins didn't have a nice way to group "builds" by environment or display a table of version numbers
