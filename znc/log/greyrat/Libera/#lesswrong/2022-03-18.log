[09:17:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ok, the toggle UI is in place. Now we've got a couple of UX design decisions (and one implementation decision) to make:  (1) Earlier you mentioned "hiding more of the UI like the metadata and sidebar" - which elements specifically? Clearly #sidebar, but also all of #page-metadata, including #page-description? How about the TOC? The abstract...?  
[09:17:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (2) When a user enables reader mode, should we save that choice? I think obviously not site-wide - but perhaps on a per-page basis? (Yes it's auto-disabled on scroll down, but should it then be auto-re-enabled on reload? On a later visit?) I think probably not, but perhaps you feel differently...? Or perhaps it should be rememebered on some pages and not others...? It's not actually clear to me to what extent, if any,
[09:17:59] <Obormot\Arcturus>  it makes sense for this to be any kind of a non-transient choice; perhaps the answer is "not at all, always transient and affects current session only, and only until scroll to end, period"; in which case, fine and well...
[09:19:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (3) Implementation-wise, it seems like we want some pages (e.g. /Clippy, obviously) to have reader mode enabled on load without the user activating it (else the impact is lost, presumably). Now, how to actually designate this? Perhaps a special <body> class...? `reader-mode-enabled` or some such?
[09:21:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (4) Relatedly to #3 (and also #2 somewhat), after a reader gets to the end of /Clippy, the links and such are revealed, etc., what happens on the next page load? Links are hidden again? Or, on such a page, is reader mode on by default only on the first visit (or rather, until the first time it's disabled, either manually or automatically via scroll), and thereafter it's off by default?

[17:42:07] <two2thehead> mildly interesting

[17:43:47] <two2thehead> yeah but that's not open sourced originals though
[17:43:53] <feep[work]> no it's better :P
[17:43:59] <two2thehead> agreed :D
[17:46:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't get it - what's so "optical illusion" about that car pic
[17:47:58] <feep[work]> it's not an optical illusion
[17:48:11] <feep[work]> but it does contain features supporting multiple contradictory interpretations for the orientation of the car
[17:48:13] <gwern> why not? it's a rabbit-duck bistable image
[17:48:23] <gwern> I've always seen them described as optical illusions
[17:48:24] <feep[work]> I don't count those as optical illusions honestly.
[17:48:31] <gwern> if they aren't an "optical illusion", what *are* they?
[17:48:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> How is it bistable
[17:48:37] <feep[work]> an optical ambiguity
[17:48:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> What are the states
[17:48:45] <feep[work]> car facing left and car facing right.
[17:48:54] <two2thehead> gwern, I think just the engine
[17:48:56] <gwern> like the concave/convex mask illusions
[17:48:57] <feep[work]> the wheels indicate left but the cabin and body shape indicates right.
[17:48:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Um... no?
[17:49:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It doesn't actually work in either direction
[17:49:08] <two2thehead> i know they used machine learning to upscale the FMV briefings
[17:49:27] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: right, but if you have a matcher that only looks at some features, or that looks at some features *first*, you'll get a sense of vertigo as it updates
[17:49:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> The wheels indicate left?? What are you talking about

[17:50:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's the intentional error in that sentence?? I don't see it
[17:50:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Ok, what about them?
[17:50:36] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: so they imply that the car points left
[17:50:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> No?
[17:51:08] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: 'what I if told you that'
[17:51:08] <feep[work]> but aside from that, looking at *just* the wheels, it's ambiguous, because they're fundamentally a symmetric/squished shape
[17:51:20] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: at least it wasn't 'the the'
[17:51:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ah yes
[17:51:27] <feep[work]> the actual rubber would reveal it, but it's black so it's obfuscated in the shadow of the body
[17:51:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Overall it seems not "ambiguous" but "wrong in any direction, with zero plausible states"
[17:52:04] <feep[work]> yes
[17:52:10] <feep[work]> but that decodes as "left, no, right, no what"
[17:52:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like if the duckrabbit didn't actually work as a duck or a rabbit or anything
[17:52:14] <dutchie> is it not of the same type as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trident which wikipedia categorises as an optical illusion
[17:52:14] <Robomot> Impossible trident - Wikipedia (An impossible trident,[1] also known as an impossible fork,[2] blivet,[3] poiuyt, or devil's tuning fork,[4] is a drawing of an impossible object (undecipherable figure), a kind of an optical illusion. It appears to have three cylindrical prongs at one end which then mysteriously transform into two rectangular prongs at the other end.)
[17:52:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I just don't get any "whoa" from this
[17:52:32] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: you need a car pattern matcher that instantly snaps to one answer
[17:52:38] <feep[work]> and then starts updating towards the other answer
[17:52:51] <feep[work]> this is easy in this case because the car has left-features at the bottom and right-features at the top
[17:52:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems dumb
[17:53:00] <feep[work]> so a directional scan will pick up all evidence for left, then all evidence for right
[17:53:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also someone explain the THatcher illusion
[17:53:47] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: well the thing is, if you're trying to model this as a 3d object, you won't be able to form the actual shape for a bit
[17:53:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: ... or ever, in fact
[17:54:01] <feep[work]> because your 3d model will get overwritten by "car left" and "car right" respectively, for a few seconds
[17:54:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... and also forever
[17:54:08] <feep[work]> well no, the actual shape exists and is clearly visible
[17:54:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[17:54:13] <feep[work]> like, this is a valid physical object
[17:54:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Definitely not
[17:54:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... no.
[17:54:21] <feep[work]> I'm p sure this car exists
[17:54:29] <feep[work]> and can even be driven
[17:54:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why do you think that
[17:54:41] <feep[work]> you can see how the wheel is placed in the direction of travel, even though that's wrong for the top half
[17:54:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> N...no
[17:54:55] <feep[work]> I think this is just a normal car that somebody put an art project on top

[17:57:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bam
[17:57:57] <gwern> I think you could build it, but only the way people build the penrose triangles etc: it works from exactly one angle and set of lighting conditions
[17:57:58] <feep[work]> you would need to open that weird side door and sort of crawl in
[17:58:14] <feep[work]> and you would have a mirror in front of you while driving
[17:58:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yeah what gwern said
[17:58:24] <feep[work]> yes, that's what I'm saying too.
[17:58:27] <two2thehead> gwern, the fact that chinese prefer to invest in property instead of their stock market is astounding
[17:58:43] <two2thehead> it's a major warning sign of a broken system
[17:58:55] <feep[work]> actually, that's what I did in fact say. "it would probably llok really weird from all other angles"
[17:58:58] <feep[work]> look*
[17:59:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: In other words, as a physical object it's exactly as impossible as Penrose triangles, there are no stable states, it's impossible any way you slice it, and it's not actually an optical illusion
[17:59:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> And everyone on Twitter is dumb.
[17:59:19] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: I don't think it's *as* impossible as penrose triangles.
[17:59:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah it is.
[17:59:30] <feep[work]> specifically, penrose triangles are depth discontinuous
[17:59:36] <feep[work]> you could build this car without depth discontinuity.

[18:11:21] <Obormot\Arcturus>  clicks a link to /Clippy and gets what? A page that doesn't look like a gwern.net page... isn't that weird...?
[18:11:51] <gwern> it would still have the logo and title and be clearly gwern.net
[18:12:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... how would it have the logo, without the sidebar?
[18:12:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or did you mean: hide all sidebar elements except the logo
[18:12:34] <gwern> I didn't mean the logo. (I did say back when I wanted to leave the logo)
[18:12:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, must've missed that... what about abstract? TOC?
[18:12:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hide that stuff too?
[18:13:11] <gwern> I am less sure about that
[18:13:25] <gwern> for Clippy, I feel the ToC is part of the experience, glancing over the exponential units
[18:13:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok I'll leave it for now and you can think about it some more
[18:13:52] <gwern> (I mean come on isn't that a super-cool and badass TOC?)
[18:13:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[18:14:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> btw have you had a chance to test today yet?
[18:14:28] <gwern> oh, no, I open it up to, but then got distracted copy-editing /Clippy
[18:14:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> fwiw you can test @ https://gwern.obormot.net/Clippy if for w/e reason sync hasn't caught up the latest changes on the live site (still gotta paste into console of course)

[18:15:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[18:15:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now you said
[18:16:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> "(4) for simplicity, I think manual reader-mode pages should set it each visit until manually disabled."
[18:16:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Should this mean:
[18:16:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "... until manually disabled, which 'disabled' setting will then hold for any other force-reader-mode pages on the site"
[18:16:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> or
[18:16:49] <gwern> yes
[18:16:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "... until manually disabled..." ok
[18:17:04] <gwern> manually disabled means "I don't want it gwern. don't force it on me."
[18:17:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, right
[18:17:21] <gwern> "'no' means 'no'!"
[18:18:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> I predict this will interact weirdly with disable-on-scroll-to-end.

[21:16:48] <Filipepe> hi
[21:21:35] <Obormot\Gaia> Continuing to read A. Merritt's _The Moon Pool_: so, our merry band of adventurers descends into the subterranean realm, where an ancient race of humans live. It soon develops that they are (culturally speaking, anyway) evil, and plan the conquest of the surface world; this they have possibly the the power to do, due to having certain advanced weapons technologies (passed down to them from their technologically advanced
[21:21:35] <Obormot\Gaia>  ancestors, before they degenerated into decadence, etc.)
[21:23:30] <gwern> (ah yes, the good ol' hollow earth / shangrila trope)
[21:24:24] <Obormot\Gaia> Of course, our villanous Russian, the professor Marakinoff, wastes no time in leveraging his superior knowledge of exotic cultures to make a secret alliance with a faction of these would-be conquerors, offering them help in their conquest in exchange for a high position in the new world order. But the moment it looks like our protagonists may instead get the upper hand, and be able to stop them, he smoothly switches gears and
[21:24:24] <Obormot\Gaia>  offers to betray his new allies to the heroes: he will steal the fancy weapons tech and so on, use it to propel Russia to world domination, and reward our heroes - 
[21:25:07] <Obormot\Gaia> "‚ÄúAll this being so, what was the logical thing for himself to do? Sure, you get me, Steve! Throw down Lugur and make an alliance with me! So he calmly offered to ditch the red dwarf if I would deliver Yolara. My reward from Russia was to be said emperorship! Can you beat it? Good Lord!‚Äù
[21:25:07] <Obormot\Gaia> He went off into a perfect storm of laughter. But not to me in the light of what Russia has done and has proved herself capable, did this thing seem at all absurd; rather in it I sensed the dawn of catastrophe colossal."
[21:25:09] <gwern> (spoilers: they would be purged after the marakinoff revolution)
[21:25:27] <Obormot\Gaia> (written, I note again, in 1919)
[21:25:48] <gwern> so, not particularly prescient
[21:30:49] <feepbot> <gwern> 'On January 25, 1915, a 67-year-old Alexander Graham Bell, stouter and grayer than once upon a time but still bursting with his old Scottish bonhomie, picked up a telephone before assembled press and public in New York City. ‚ÄúHoy! Hoy!‚Äù he said in his booming brogue. (From the first days of his invention until the end of his own days, Bell loathed the standard
[21:30:49] <feepbot> telephonic greeting of ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù) ‚ÄúMr. Watson? Are you there? Do you hear me?‚Äù In front of another assemblage in San Fransisco, Bell‚Äôs old friend and helper Thomas J. Watson answered him. ‚ÄúYes, Mr. Bell. I hear you perfectly. Do you hear me well?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, your voice is perfectly distinct,‚Äù said Bell. ‚ÄúIt is as clear as if you were in New York.‚Äù Inevitably, Bell
[21:30:49] <feepbot> was soon cajoled into repeating those famous first words ever spoken into a working telephone: ‚ÄúMr. Watson, come here. I want to see you.‚Äù Whereupon Watson noted that, instead of seven seconds, the journey would now take him seven days. It may not have been a transatlantic link quite yet, but it did feel like a culmination of sorts.'

[23:40:18] <gwern> it is indeed. less adorable was the part where he was laying on the numpad
[23:40:35] <gwern> even a cat eventually gives up on laying on that
[23:40:52] <quanticle> Your fault for getting a keyboard with a numpad
[23:40:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ideally we'd have a "reader icon solid, reader icon outline [auto], reader icon with slash through it" ... but there's no `book-slash` or w/e. A dilemma :\
[23:41:07] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I had not thought as far as the icon for the 'auto' in reader-mode. possibly just the gears? so it's [open book | gears | closed book]
[23:41:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm

[23:41:34] * Obormot\Arcturus looks at the font-awesome catalog again
[23:41:40] <synthmeat> Obormot\Arcturus: nope. doesn't move. just changes how black/white it is
[23:41:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf
[23:41:56] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: rsynced & flushed
[23:42:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: Browser, version, platform?
[23:42:27] <synthmeat> ok, guy. *CHROME CANARY* :D
[23:42:35] <synthmeat> (lemme check a normal browser :D)
[23:42:38] <gwern> (ooh, much cleaner)
[23:43:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... they have a stroopwafel icon but not "book with gears" or "book with slash" or anything useful

[23:43:37] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: possible side effect here - the theme toggle no longer fades?
[23:43:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: impossible D:
[23:43:49] <synthmeat> Obormot\Arcturus: ok yeah, sorry. moves down a lil' bit, sure. but i don't know how that's related?
[23:44:01] <gwern> or wait, no I just didn't page enough
[23:44:12] <synthmeat> (in all browsers, and both hori/veri, all good)
[23:44:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: it... what? When you click it, it moves. That's what indicates the active state
[23:44:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> What do you mean "how that's related", lol
[23:44:36] <synthmeat> no, that indicates transition, not state
[23:44:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... no
[23:45:06] <synthmeat> dude. i'm just saying that i'm looking at 3 pretty similar color icons and i can barely tell which one is active, that's all.
[23:45:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh I see
[23:45:18] <synthmeat> by active i mean selected. forget hover
[23:45:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I thought you meant "active" as in the button state
[23:45:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see now
[23:45:37] <synthmeat> i mentioned hover because it looked like a maybe nice quick fix, swapping active/and hover appearance states
[23:46:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, yeah, I get it now
[23:46:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I don't agree but I get it)

[23:47:58] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: how about adding '#TOC ul li::before' to the display:none https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16476346303360307.png

[23:48:03] <synthmeat> :)
[23:48:52] <adiabatic> "defecting on yourself" this is one typo/autocorrupt away from being something very different
[23:49:03] <gwern> adiabatic: and yet, remains synonmous
[23:49:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Hmmm ok I guess. Might want to adjust that padding too ... 
[23:49:15] * Obormot\Arcturus does it
[23:54:04] <rmmh> ggreer: why are there so many Greers
[23:54:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Fecundity
[23:54:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I have an icon suggestion but you might not like it
[23:55:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: On: https://fontawesome.com/icons/align-justify?s=solid ; off: https://fontawesome.com/icons/align-slash?s=solid ; auto: https://fontawesome.com/icons/align-justify?s=solid with a small https://fontawesome.com/icons/gear superimposed on it.

[23:56:33] <gwern> why not put a little gear next to a little book :(
[23:57:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then what is "off"?? An outline book...? I dunno
[23:57:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway I'll try it both ways and we can see
