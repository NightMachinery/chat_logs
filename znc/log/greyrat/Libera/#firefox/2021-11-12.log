[00:32:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft deliberately sends Firefox corrupt pages, and Mozilla silently corrects for that. Web compatibility evangelism is a lost cause. At this point, the correct response from Firefox is to just plug everything immediately and assume they won't get a reply.
[00:32:54] <BaronVladimirHar> Then if they do get a reply, arrange to back out the site compatibility hack.
[00:33:16] <BaronVladimirHar> Chrome has become the IE 6 of the modern web.
[00:33:50] <BaronVladimirHar> It almost is pointless to try to run Gecko. I point out site compatibility problems, along with what's needed to fix them.

[00:34:02] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla employees troll me and hide my comments instead of fixing them.
[00:34:23] <BaronVladimirHar> The only way the site ever works again is if the site happens to get redesigned and it happens to unbreak Gecko.
[00:34:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla itself has become unbearably toxic.
[00:35:31] <BaronVladimirHar> At least when I report bugs to Webkit and GNOME Web they say "Thank you for the bug report." and if it's not good enough they say "Can you please type this in and see what it says?".
[00:36:22] <BaronVladimirHar> Not "Hi Ryan, you're being unhelpful for pointing out that Firefox couldn't run Facebook due to a UA issue we couldn't be bothered to fix for three years while it recommended our competitor, so we're going to silence you. -Love, Mozilla".

[01:55:40] <Entelin> BaronVladimirHar: Browsed over some of your articles, good points. I've not been paying much attention to firefox, but the issues have been creeping into my conciousness in the last number of years. Are there any "good" functional options though? Brave seems a bit bloated with all the coin stuff and whatnot. While ultra minimal options don't generally have good plugin support, and thus the lack of
[01:55:42] <Entelin> adblocking is pretty painful. Any browsers you think I should be paying attention to?
[01:56:33] <BaronVladimirHar> I think the general situation is in a state of decay, personally.
[01:57:04] <BaronVladimirHar> I've been using GNOME Web as a daily driver with Vivaldi as a fallback for stubborn sites that want "Chrome" and absolutely insist on it.
[01:57:36] <Entelin> "the web", html et all has always been basically a mistake imo, I've always throught that, it's a pile of hacks. But... it's kind of nessesary for daily life unfortunately.
[01:57:40] <BaronVladimirHar> Web has its quirks, not the least of which is odd conflicts between the Intel Video Acceleration API and Webkit's compositor under Wayland.
[01:57:59] <dalias> entelin, firefox is the only browser worth paying attention to at present :(
[01:58:01] <BaronVladimirHar> But it generally works okay. I turned the compositor off and the VA-API works fine.
[01:58:13] <dalias> that's not to say it's good, but everything else that's currently viable is just reskinned chrome
[01:58:31] <dalias> with all the antifeatures and limitations on ad blocking :(
[01:58:50] <BaronVladimirHar> LibreWolf is trying to maintain a soft fork of Firefox with the proprietary stuff and spyware yanked out.
[01:58:50] <Entelin> dalias: what about ungoogle chrome?
[01:58:55] <BaronVladimirHar> I had to tweak it up quite a bit.
[01:59:09] <BaronVladimirHar> I have not used Ungoogled Chromium.
[01:59:17] <Entelin> I've not either, i just know it exists
[01:59:31] <BaronVladimirHar> It sounds like it may be worth investigating, but Google is also doing things just to mess with people who want to use "Chromium", period.
[01:59:44] <dalias> entelin, sure it has the worst google malware removed, but it still has nerfed adblocking support and lots of other antifeatures
[01:59:52] <BaronVladimirHar> It sounds to me like if you're avoiding Google, Ungoogled Chromium may work out fine.
[02:00:29] <BaronVladimirHar> I finally did find out where Vivaldi-Adblock is in the source tree.
[02:01:02] <BaronVladimirHar> In my opinion, it's tainted because they obviously looked at GPLv3 code and then wrote their own code to reimplement ABP and some of uBO.
[02:01:32] <BaronVladimirHar> But it's notwhere near as good as uBO, so I disabled it and use uBO.
[02:02:01] <BaronVladimirHar> I tried talking to the people with copyrights on uBO and ABP and neither were interested in pursuing it.
[02:02:41] <BaronVladimirHar> GNOME Web doesn't use WebRequest or DeclarativeNetRequest because Webkit has Content Blockers.
[02:03:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Unfortunately, it's hard to find a good blocker in this format. There's Easylist and Better, but Better says they're shutting down in protest of Apple scanning users' devices.
[02:03:48] <BaronVladimirHar> If they no longer make their Apple apps, then there will be no more list updates, and pointing GNOME Web to it is not a great idea.
[02:04:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Easylist doesn't do much about content blocker blockers, doesn't have EasyPrivacy in it, and takes no action against cryptominers.
[02:05:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla and Google gave cryptominers and other malware an ideal platform.
[02:05:17] <BaronVladimirHar> It's called WebAssembly.
[02:06:29] <dalias> using js vm (including wasm) as a compute platform should have been an opt-in permission
[02:06:51] <dalias> otherwise, sites only have a few kB of working space and a tiny budget of virtual cycles to run UI interaction type js code
[02:07:17] <dalias> if this had been done right, the web would have note become the slow, resource-intensive hellhole it is now
[02:07:30] <dalias> and react (the worst part of it) would not have been possible

[02:15:46] <BaronVladimirHar> Yes, modern browsers facilitate an invasion of your computer with proprietary software, malware, and crap.
[02:15:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Even if the browser itself really is "open source".
[02:16:43] <BaronVladimirHar> Most of the issues a "sandbox" is there for today wouldn't even be a problem if JavaScript wasn't being demanded by websites.

[03:17:18] <BaronVladimirHar> It has Firefox Sync support, but the "password" sync is hopelessly broken.
[03:17:29] <BaronVladimirHar> It seems to be able to bring in your bookmarks though.

[03:18:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Well, at first glance it appears to move your Firefox passwords over.
[03:19:05] <BaronVladimirHar> But then you go to the site and that entry is non-functional.
[03:19:29] <BaronVladimirHar> And it will ask you to make a duplicate entry, and then that works, but clearing the Firefox Sync ones out causes the browser to crash.
[03:19:29] <BaronVladimirHar> :/
[03:19:59] <BaronVladimirHar> I've put in a feature request where there's just a profile migration feature again where the user can move everything over from Firefox and be done with it, no sync.
[03:20:24] <BaronVladimirHar> Or at least support for GNOME Web to import passwords in CSV format.

[22:25:50] <BaronVladimirHar> It would be nice if you could import passwords from CSV.

[22:28:03] <BaronVladimirHar> Yeah, but then you have to paste them back in one at a time.
[22:28:21] <BaronVladimirHar> When it could just parse the file and merge them back in to a clean profile.
[22:28:52] <nemo> looks like it is simply something they haven't had the time to work on

[22:31:37] <BaronVladimirHar> Then I can give them my "SHADDUP!!!!" UA hack for all of THEIR domains.
[22:31:45] <nemo> appears they are in fact adding import

[22:32:04] <BaronVladimirHar> Getting a legitimate UA is a privilege.
[22:32:04] <BaronVladimirHar> Sites abuse it, and they should just get the stick.
[22:32:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Worth a try, but in the mean time just lie to their site.
[22:32:56] <BaronVladimirHar> You can go ask them to fix it.

[22:38:47] <nemo> if you're focusing on privacy and it's basically firefox stable plus some customisations, you probably should always use the Firefox UA since it is more generic
[22:39:09] <nemo> just like firefox with resist fingerprinting modifies the UA
[22:40:02] <nemo> privacy.resistFingerprinting;true may already do that. you might want to check
[22:40:21] <BaronVladimirHar> LibreWolf does way more than that.
[22:40:37] <nemo> I'm just saying you may want to verify "librewolf" is in fact using the generic UA
[22:40:40] <nemo> that's all I'm suggesting
[22:40:45] <nemo> turn that on in "librewolf" and validate
[22:40:57] <nemo> since otherwise you're adding quite a lot to your fingerprint
[22:41:12] <BaronVladimirHar> It uses arkanfox and some other user.js settings to disable questionable "features" that are basically just security hazards and Google shitposting into "standards" and Mozilla blindly copying it.
[22:41:20] <nemo> the fact that you have to spoof a firefox UA on youtube suggests to me it is not in fact using a generic UA
[22:41:45] <BaronVladimirHar> Oh no, I mean, I leave it alone even though there's sometimes Get Chrome spam.
[22:42:07] <nemo> so... again. suggestion is. privacy.resistFingerprinting;true in "librewolf" and check your UA string
[22:42:14] <BaronVladimirHar> Because using a Chrome UA on Youtube breaks the entire site.
[22:42:15] <nemo> if it is not firefox, you may have a privacy issue
