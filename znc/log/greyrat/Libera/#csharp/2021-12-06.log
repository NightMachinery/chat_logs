[02:38:02] <moose> Nasp: haha the question is... is the third monitor for the docs they probably didn't write or is it to post and be like "can you believe this shit?!" :P
[02:38:24] <Nasp> It's just because there's so much complicated code and i need to take it all in at the same time
[02:38:31] <moose> Oh god
[02:38:31] <Nasp> I've boiled it down so it's a lot simpler
[02:38:34] <moose> That's option C, the worst.
[02:38:47] <Nasp> Like stuff mixed in witheachother with lots of mixed responsibility
[02:38:55] <Nasp> I've split it out so now each part has one job really
[02:39:04] <moose> Did they define multiple unrelated classes in one file?
[02:39:07] <Nasp> And this is our auth code and it's suuuch a pain
[02:39:34] <Nasp> No more like the auth is split out to be both in the base controller and in an attribute
[02:40:03] <Nasp> Now my only issue is some filters is hit before the others
[02:40:04] <Nasp> This is MVC btw
[02:40:05] <moose> So like [Authorize] but then they do the actual verification of the auth code or signing/encrypting in the controller or something?
[02:40:15] <Nasp> Nah it just does some extra checking there
[02:40:18] <moose> Ah.
[02:40:23] <moose> Weird nuanced things then, ever harder to spot
[02:40:28] <irwiss> tbh as long as it's not 1.5k lines of serialport string parsing written in vb module that has mutable global state it's tolerable
[02:40:51] <Nasp> Like our base controllers has 500 lines
[02:41:09] <Nasp> moose: It's quite hard to find exactly what authenticates and authorizes users
[02:41:17] <moose> Yeah I can imagine
[02:41:19] <Nasp> And more stuff has just been piled upon over the years withotu a cleanup
[02:41:30] <Nasp> Now it's down to small simple Requirements and AuthHandlers in AspNetCore
[02:41:58] <Nasp> Although i kinda miss to be able to do authorization in parallel
[02:42:55] <Nasp> Or rather i think it does it in parallel maybe, but it shouldn't wait for eachother if one succeeds
[02:54:14] <Nasp> irwiss:  It's probably around 1500 lines

[04:07:05] <lz_> I'm processing 16 bit per channel pictures and there's like a thousand steps. I have to guess at which steps things go wrong and I want to die
[04:07:28] <lz_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34859934/libpng-returning-invalid-data-for-16b-channel-truecolour-imagemagick-images
[04:07:31] <lz_> seriously what the fuck
[04:16:01] <bpmedley> lz_ : Gross.  Just out of curiosity is ImageSharp an option?
[04:16:54] <lz_> bpmedley: I'm using image sharp for writing, libpng for reading. image magick doesn't even list the 16/8 they mention in the post, but I do have my bytes duplicated
[04:17:15] <lz_> at least it gave me the idea of getting the "gradient test image" working first and I'm making some progress
[04:17:15] <bpmedley> Sounds frustrating.
[04:26:47] <lz_> this was the first of the 3 things I wanted to do today and I think I might just give up
[04:28:51] <bpmedley> I'm also working with some imaging stuff, although I'm on Linux.  Just so many options that are "getting better".

[05:21:56] <lz_> the input images don't have this duplicated bytes problem, but the output one does
[05:27:19] <lz_> LOL ok
[05:27:34] <lz_> just image = Image.Load() then image.Save() ruins it
[05:29:04] <lz_> oh wow load loads it into a rgba32 image, that explains it

[13:58:33] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yeah i just needed a new scope that isn't tied to the previous one
[13:58:38] <Nasp> We use two scopes per request :/
[14:00:15] <Nasp> jmer:  I think i found the issue with deploy is that it queues up due to us deploying to staging
[14:00:24] <Nasp> So when we deploy to staging and there is a new staging deploy ready
[14:00:31] <Nasp> It blocks production deploy
[14:00:45] <Nasp> So as long as people merge and merge and merge it can't deploy until everything has been deployed to staging

[14:12:36] <Nasp> TC
[14:12:40] <MatthiasVance> oh
[14:13:00] <Nasp> I would rather deploy to staging -> prod
[14:13:00] <MatthiasVance> In DevOps (so maybe also TC) there is a setting that a new release cancels out old ones
[14:13:05] <Nasp> Instead of deploy it all to staging then production
[14:13:09] <Nasp> Would make the flow faster
[14:13:11] <MatthiasVance> And that if you have 4 staging releases waiting it will only do the last integration
[14:13:21] <Nasp> Well i dont think we want new releases canceling the old one
[14:13:26] <Nasp> Kinda nice having it in smaller releases
[14:13:31] <Nasp> But this just makes it more painful
[14:13:34] <MatthiasVance> But you are doing 4 *at the same time*
[14:13:47] <Nasp> Well if staging deployment didn't block prod
[14:13:52] <Nasp> Then they woulodn't queue up

[14:44:33] <MaNa2k> the 3700x is 7nm
[14:44:44] <bomb> why AMD couldn't TSMC premium and have a 5nm like Apple did?
[14:44:46] <Diablo-D3> yes, the 3700x is 7nm.
[14:44:55] <Diablo-D3> bomb: because its pecking order at tsmc

[14:45:08] <Diablo-D3> apple never says no

[14:45:20] <Diablo-D3> its not about money, amd is literally not offered the contract

[14:45:40] <Diablo-D3> MaNa2k: yeah, get the 5800
[14:45:46] <MaNa2k> hmm
[14:45:51] <Diablo-D3> I have a 3600 btw, there are "flaws" with the zen 2, but really minor ones
[14:46:16] <Diablo-D3> zen/zen+'s issue was, in ryzen, not enough io backplane left to run the system well, since it was designed to be ran at 4 at a time for epycs
[14:46:39] <Diablo-D3> zen 2, 3, and 4 use a dedicated io chip thats identical on all machines (epyc gets 2 of them, but still same chip)
[14:46:58] <Diablo-D3> zen 2's cpu chip design is split in sets of 4, with two sets per chip

[14:47:35] <Diablo-D3> Ive been recommending 5800 non-stop
[14:47:41] <MaNa2k> it uses more tdp the 5000
[14:48:06] <Diablo-D3> so, the 3700x and 3800x are "twins", both identical 8 cores, but the 3700x is ran at a lower tdp
[14:48:09] <MaNa2k> more tdp, no fan included, and about 1k more expensice then 3600x
[14:48:13] <Diablo-D3> there is no low tdp variant of the 8 core in zen 3
[14:48:39] <Diablo-D3> 1k? in what currency?
[14:48:43] <MaNa2k> nok
[14:49:01] <Diablo-D3> so about $110 usd?
[14:50:10] <bomb> why Norsk ain't no Euro?
[14:50:18] <Diablo-D3> bomb: they're not EU
[14:50:32] <bomb> arrogant pricks
[14:50:42] <jbe> that would technically not stop them from adopting the euro if they wanted to
[14:50:54] <bomb> yeah
[14:51:21] <Diablo-D3> well, depends how you define technically
[14:51:28] <bomb> also being in EU wouldn't stop them using whatever primitive wild animal currency called NOK they use
[14:51:36] <Diablo-D3> there would be no political roadblocks in norway's government to join the eurozone
[14:51:54] <MaNa2k> Diablo-D3, yes about 110
[14:51:56] <MaNa2k> usd
[14:52:38] <Diablo-D3> MaNa2k: so whats the actual prices in usd of the 3700x and the 5800?
[14:52:51] <Diablo-D3> and lack of heatsink is fine, you'd want to use a third party one anyways
[14:53:24] <Diablo-D3> amd's current heatsink is great for a stock heatsink, but neither amd nor intel make heatsinks that can really deal with the thermal characteristics of their cpus
[14:53:58] <Diablo-D3> like, its a weird victory... like 1.5x-2x better than intel's on a similar peak watt cpu, yet insufficient for the task at hand
[14:54:17] <Diablo-D3> Im glad they took it out, because for me, I have a stock heatsink in my parts box I will never use
[14:55:57] <Diablo-D3> bomb: btw, its a complex thing for countries that belong to the EEA
[14:57:58] <Diablo-D3> its like being part of the EU, but with none of the bullshit of the EU, unless it involves the EU equivalent of the interstate commerce clause
[14:58:45] <Diablo-D3> but you can accept the euro without making it your currency, but also freely do business with EU countries like you were one
[14:59:03] <Diablo-D3> extremely few countries are EEA members and not just EU already

[16:17:10] <kobo> It's hard to google as the term is kind of "hijacked". We're going to gradually transition a 20year old system to a new system made in .net 6/core, and we'd like to use the same database as we already are.. but I'd like to use EF with the new system, but I vaguely remember it can get quite messy using 2 systems with the same dba nd only one of them is using EF

[16:46:23] <jmer> kobo: if you allready have the DB I think you have to go DB first with EF
[16:47:42] <kobo> yep, that's what I'm thinking too, but I mean if there's schema changes or columns added/removed I think EF will kinda crash? I got vague memories of this happening before
[16:48:00] <kobo> so I need to find some way where we can still map our SP's and query tables directly with ef
[16:48:43] <jmer> if you make breaking changes in your DB, your app will crash no matter what ORM you're using
[16:49:27] <Diablo-D3> I think hes trying to figure out how to not make changes in his DB while upgrading to a much newer EF?
[16:49:33] <Diablo-D3> this is why ORMs suck and you should never use them, btw
[16:50:32] <bpmedley> kobo : What's wrong with making your Entities always match the db schema?
[16:50:40] <kobo> bpmedley, developers :D
[16:50:45] <bpmedley> haha, true
[16:51:14] <kobo> Diablo-D3, yep. I really want us to be able to use the powers of ORM's but we still need to be resilient and be able to use our sprocs
[16:51:44] <Diablo-D3> kobo: yeah, the answer is "dont use orms". tada.
[16:52:05] <kobo> Diablo-D3, my view is not that black and white
[16:52:17] <MatthiasVance> Orm, isn't that the Viking guy
[16:52:30] <Diablo-D3> I understand, but c#/.net has no good micro-orms that Im aware of
[16:52:30] <jmer> MatthiasVance: It is...
[16:52:55] <jmer> Diablo-D3: you don't like Dapper?
[16:52:56] <canton7> Diablo-D3, Dapper?
[16:53:09] <canton7> There was another one as well... /me goes digging
[16:53:10] <kobo> Diablo-D3, there's multiple I've heard of, but EF seems to be the go to
[16:53:20] <kobo> go to ORM not go to micro orm
[16:53:29] <jmer> kobo: EF is just the go to because there are a huge amount of C# devs who HATE writing SQL

[16:54:30] <tlf> ef is definitely more simple than writing a ton of sql
[16:54:33] <jmer> kobo: you can get extensions for Dapper that generates SQL for you as well
[16:54:34] <tlf> not that sql is that much of a pain
[16:54:34] <Diablo-D3> I'd rather have something like JDBI, but for C#
[16:55:03] <jmer> kobo: but... If you have a bunch of SQL-clueless devs, EF is the way to go. If your DB allready exists, use DB first.
[16:55:13] <jmer> kobo: afaik there are no other options if you want to use EF with an exisiting DB
[16:55:47] <kobo> yeah well it was more like if there's any caveats, like I remember we used to always create SQL views in some projects, and use EF on those views
[16:55:53] *** Joins: MaNa4k (~MaNa2k@109.247.79.178)
[16:55:56] <kobo> in that case adding columns wouldn't break EF
[16:56:20] <jmer> I don't think ADDING columns breaks EF but I could be wrong.
[16:56:32] <Diablo-D3> adding columns wont break it, but it just wont know about them iirc?
[16:56:41] <jmer> Diablo-D3: that's what I would expect as well.
[16:57:03] <tlf> Diablo-D3, wouldn't you just do a update-database _context?
[16:57:04] <kobo> perhaps it where a datatype change or something; I can't remember but.. that's how we resolved using EF to an existing database that was shared inbetween multiple projects
[16:57:11] <tlf> doesn't that inform it of the changes?
[16:57:21] <jmer> kobo: changing a datatype can be a breaking change yes.
[16:57:43] <jmer> but yes any change you want to be aware of in EF would require re-scaffolding
[16:58:05] <jmer> But ask yourself; how often do you change your DB and don't want it reflected in your application? xD

[18:24:19] <jonp> > Heart attacks are always in the top two or three categories of police line of duty deaths.
[18:24:45] <Slade> yea. i knew it was up there
[18:24:55] <jonp> i hadn't thought of it, but it makes sense
[18:24:57] <Slade> i mean its up there in america as a whole, but police especially
[18:25:09] <jonp> still not #1.  which means it's probably #3 or #4 this year.
[18:25:10] <jonp> still high

[18:29:16] <jonp> biberu: good point; holy shit
[18:29:24] <jonp> 182/295 deaths in 2020 is COVID-19

[18:29:49] <bomb> 2019 -> 2020 doubled cop deaths
[18:30:04] <jonp> entirely due to covid
[18:30:09] <bomb> ah, because covid yeah

[18:30:13] <Slade> the big surprise to me is PERCENTAGE OF OFFICERS KILLED WEARING BODY ARMOR IN GUNFIRE DEATHS
[18:30:28] <bomb> drowning increased 300%
[18:30:35] <tlf> Slade, body armor is a relative term

[23:36:41] <jonp> CRAY-CRAY was fixed in: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/commit/cf84e1b9a172a1e31d7eabf2f5eecd57ab57f301
[23:36:50] <ki9a> but this is all in xamarin-android
[23:36:57] <ki9a> is mono still being updated itself?
[23:37:00] <jonp> right, but it's using MonoVM
[23:37:02] <jonp> from dotnet/runtime
[23:37:07] <jonp> *not* from mono/mono
[23:37:45] <ki9a> oh
[23:38:06] <ki9a> so what is the status of the mono project as on github.com/mono/mono now? Dead?
[23:38:40] <jonp> it's used for "legacy"/"classic" Xamarin.Android & Xamarin.iOS
[23:38:50] <brianonymous> JAVA_INTEROP_ASSEMBLY_NAME[] = "Java.Interop"; <- is that for droid?
[23:38:56] <jonp> yes
[23:39:40] <ki9a> oke
[23:39:45] <ki9a> that confused me
[23:40:05] <JakeSays> there is now one runtime with multiple vm's
[23:40:28] <ki9a> do you happen to know how good/bad the embedding features of .net core are now in v6?
[23:40:55] <JakeSays> according to jonp they're essentially the same as mono
[23:40:56] <ki9a> I know in v3 or v5 we tried and it didn't support com/IUnknown on osx/linx.
[23:40:58] <jonp> not much better than v6, afaik
[23:41:08] <jonp> much smaller than mono's embedding API surface
[23:41:18] <bomb> imagine Microsoft went with .INFO instead of .NET
[23:41:36] <ki9a> but the embedding stuff is only if you compile it yourself I take?
[23:41:53] <jonp> there should be prebuilt versions you can grab
[23:42:04] <jonp> i just forget the magical MSBuild voodoo you need to use to get it.
[23:42:11] <jonp> but WE don't build it; dotnet/runtime does
[23:42:31] <JakeSays> i'm confused. i thought there was one common api now for both vms
[23:42:41] <jonp> "user-space" managed code has the same API
[23:42:48] <jonp> "kernel-space" *native* code does not
[23:42:54] <jonp> (for lack of better terms)
[23:43:32] <JakeSays> ah.
[23:43:48] <ki9a> do you happen to know any place wher eI can find out more about monovm inside .net core and/or download it ?
[23:43:48] <JakeSays> so a cluster fuck then
[23:44:20] <ki9a> Because we have a VERY nice wrapper around mono atm
[23:44:35] <ki9a> and would hate to have to port to the non existent .net core apis
[23:44:41] <JakeSays> written in pascal i suppose
[23:44:46] <ki9a> (apparently even mscoree.h isn't properly supported anymore)
[23:45:04] <ki9a> https://github.com/remobjects/marzipan yes
[23:45:05] <JakeSays> ms totally abandoned the embedding story with core
[23:45:32] <ki9a> there's a "get me a pointer to a static function"
[23:45:35] <ki9a> api
[23:45:37] <ki9a> that's about it

[23:46:31] <bomb> brianonymous how do you cope with your self-anger caused by the fact that you can never maximize a window on your wide-ass screens?
[23:46:32] <JakeSays> his attitude at the time was "you don't need it"
[23:46:55] <brianonymous> it doesnt bother me at all
[23:47:08] <brianonymous> i mean, i can, i just dont need a 4 foot wide VS
[23:47:18] <JakeSays> lol
[23:47:24] *** Quits: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:47:35] <bomb> are they as wide as three 4:3 screens?
[23:47:51] <brianonymous> its uhhh, 38:9 or something?
[23:48:25] <brianonymous> 32:9
[23:48:49] <bomb> 11:9 * 3
[23:48:51] <JakeSays> jonp: what discord is that?
[23:48:52] *** Joins: alguien_ (~alguien@user/alguien)
[23:48:54] <bomb> a little narrow but workable
[23:48:58] <brianonymous> there are apps to split for maximizes and shit, but i dont run em
[23:49:01] <ki9a> jonp: thanks!
[23:49:04] <JakeSays> bomb:  -1:0
[23:49:23] <bomb> how do you center a window you want, but vertically maximized?
[23:49:46] <brianonymous> once i put it in place, which is at startup, i just do it by hand
[23:49:53] <brianonymous> windows updates are the only thing that hoses me
[23:50:27] <bomb> but by hand wouldn't be pixel perfect
[23:50:36] <brianonymous> samsung does provide software to do it magically, but i havent tried that version yet
[23:51:19] <bomb> I'm offended by the lack of your OCD lol
[23:51:43] <brianonymous> lol
