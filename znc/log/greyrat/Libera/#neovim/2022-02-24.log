[06:09:38] <mjlbach[m]> My understanding is tsconfig.json is what is being edited
[06:09:54] <mjlbach[m]> and you edit that file, and the settings are not immediately available to the language server (tsserver)
[06:10:05] <brjc[m]> nope, tsconfig doesn't change
[06:10:22] <brjc[m]> if I make a new file in the same dir, it doesn't enable completions (defined in tsconfig.json) until the file is saved 
[06:10:30] <mjlbach[m]> Ahh
[06:10:31] <mjlbach[m]> I understand
[06:10:43] <mjlbach[m]> I can only assume that is a limitation of tsserver
[06:11:21] <mjlbach[m]> That issue was servers not attaching when the buffer was not a file on disk
[06:12:30] <brjc[m]> right, right. yeah it very well might be just tsserver; a workaround would probably need to be more clever than I'm willing to think of atm. I suppose it's not the biggest hassle

[06:27:00] <agriffis> So if I'm gonna save some data from a neovim-lua script, and read it back later, is there a standardish data format and API that I should use? In JS I'd use JSON, for example, with the built-in API
[06:29:49] <agriffis> The data I'm saving is two strings: a sha256 and a single character. Right now I'm writing them as two lines in a file, and reading them back as such, effectively a tuple. But I'd rather embrace structured data if there's a norm and supporting API.
[06:35:53] <s00pcan[m]>  * I didn't know this at first either when I got on this client, but you can surround the code with triple backticks to format text as code. The first line should only have first three backticks and the file type, such as vim...

[06:36:15] <mjlbach[m]> <agriffis> "So if I'm gonna save some data..." <- Depends
[06:36:24] <mjlbach[m]> what are your needs? It's trivial to save/restore a json
[06:36:43] <mjlbach[m]> if it's more high thoroughput there's a sqlite neovim plugin
[06:37:35] <agriffis> JSON is fine. This is low throughput. I have a clipboard provider that saves/restores regtype if the content checksum matches. I wrote it in vimscript a long time ago, just rewrote in lua today.
[06:39:56] <mjlbach[m]> I would just do json since it's built-in and deserializes nicely to a lua table
[06:41:54] <agriffis> Great! So I should just use `vim.fn.json_encode` and `vim.fn.json_decode`?

[06:56:33] <agriffis> When you're hooking up vim.json.encode/decode to writefile/readfile, do you use binary mode? Otherwise writefile/readfile expect to work with lists of lines.
[06:57:14] <agriffis> i.e. do your functions expect to receive a binary Blob
[06:58:03] <agriffis> or should I just table.concat whatever lines I get back

[16:59:02] <PyGamer0PyGamer0> its like a parser that parses your code and highlights based on that
[16:59:12] <PyGamer0PyGamer0> (if im right)
[16:59:33] <LeoNerd> It's a sortof parser library thing.. the idea is that the parser code is independent of the program using the results
[16:59:49] <LeoNerd> So various code editors, highlighters, and other tooling, can all use the same parser
[16:59:52] <dundargoc> Short version: it analyzes the code and builds an internal model of it. It can then use this model to do cool stuff like "give all parenthesis this color", or "fold all functions in this code."
[17:00:01] <Friithian> hm, interesting
[17:00:07] <zanshin> Friithian: It builds a syntax tree for a source file, and lets that tree be manipulated. Usually to provide colorization. https://derek.stride.host/posts/comprehensive-introduction-to-tree-sitter

[17:03:23] <clason[m]> Well, you can't directly manipulate the tree, but it gives you a very efficient method of extracting syntax information from a buffer while editing, which you can use for all manner of useful things (starting with, but not limited to, highlighting)
[17:03:30] <clason[m]> PyGamer0PyGamer0: no, it's a C library
[17:03:45] <clason[m]> tree-sitter != lsp
[17:04:04] <dundargoc> Why does it say treesitter is 66% rust. What's the rust for then lol
[17:04:28] <clason[m]> the tree-sitter repo not only contains the C library but also a rust crate
[17:04:30] <Friithian> if I had a lot more parens in code I may want this, but so far I'm not doing whatever that language is that is just(((((((((((((())))))))))))))))))))
[17:04:35] <clason[m]> Neovim only uses the C library

[17:05:05] <Friithian> ah that's the word!
[17:05:07] <clason[m]> the CLI (`tree-sitter generate? ) etc. is written in Rust, though.

[17:30:00] <p00f> that's how you can remap it using wm settings
[17:30:35] <jaawerth[m]> I held off rebinding capslock for years because I didn't want to ruin my muscle memory for when I had to hop on other keyboards. Having to use macbooks with the damn touchbar for work finally got me to take the plunge and honestly I regret putting it off so long
[17:30:57] <Friithian> the only annoyance is when you use someone else's computer
[17:31:15] <jaawerth[m]> yeah. which in covid times is extra rare
[17:31:23] <p00f> ikr it's so irritating
[17:31:31] <cbus> p00f, what made me realize it is "some os:es warn about caps lock when entering passwords" :D

[17:39:20] <Friithian> dip pens are so yesterday
[17:39:33] <Friithian> and btw I say this with 2 fountain pens in my pocket
[17:40:02] <jaawerth[m]> haha yeah I do have a few fountain pens but I got converter cartridges for them all so I can just draw ink out of the jar
[17:40:08] <Friithian> yeah same
[17:40:23] <Friithian> means I can use some lovely inks
[17:40:31] <Friithian> I mainly use iroshizuku inks
[17:41:02] <jaawerth[m]> for me it's mainly not having to replace cheap plastic crap all the time but nice inks are a bonus
[17:41:29] <Friithian> I cannot stand how cheap pens write
[17:41:40] <Friithian> heck, even pilot's G2 just doesn't hold a candle to a fountain pen
[17:41:53] <jaawerth[m]> doesn't bother me that much but I'm more mindful when I write with a fountain pen
[17:42:01] <jaawerth[m]> makes me focus on it etc
[17:42:39] <Friithian> being left handed I have general issues with pens so a fountain pen lets me take just a bit more control

[21:29:43] <wyre> hi guys, suddenly nvim has lost the syntax highlighting for a single bash script
[21:29:47] <wyre> why may be this? 
[21:32:30] <clason[m]> probably because you <del>foolishly</del> eagerly enabled filetype.lua and disabled filetype.vim?
[21:34:17] <wyre> clason[m], how can I check if I did accidentally that? 
[21:34:31] <wyre> apparently appending the extension fixes the problem
[21:34:57] <clason[m]> well, you would need to have explicitly enabled it in your init.vim
[21:36:05] <wyre> clason[m], oh, I've just noticed I broke the shebang accidentally üòÜ
[21:36:13] <wyre> but thank you clason[m] üòâ
[21:36:28] <clason[m]> ah, that would do it, alright :D

[21:43:25] <ii14[m]> wyre: add this to get sheband detection if you're using filetype.lua:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/bb8471101d3f26ca6e66c90c7c15f4bba63d1bb0)
[21:43:40] <clason[m]> or just update to latest master ;)
[21:44:08] <ii14[m]> if `:echo g:do_filetype_lua` prints 1 then you have it enabled
[21:45:49] <ii14[m]> okay, latest as of 1 hour ago when this was fixed
[21:45:56] <ii14[m]> thank you gpanders

[22:11:17] <s00pcan[m]>  * ah, ok. I thought that's what you were getting at. It got sold to Rubbermaid and now makes products in Japan. I do have some of the German-made ones. You made it confusing by saying that they don't make the 800 model any more, which was only ever made by the Japanese manufacturer. I think you mistook this for the 600.

[23:25:54] <prg> Does anyone know of a way to perform a TSUpdate and quit in the same command?  For example, I use "nvim -c ':PlugUpdate|q'" to update my plugins.. But when I try "nvim -c ':TSUpdate|q'" or "nvim -c ':TSUpdate all|q'", the |q gets treated as an argument to TSUpdate.  Can anyone think of another way to perform a TSUpdate and then quit neovim?

[23:33:35] <prg> I have the exact same issue with TSUpdateSync.  TSUpdateSync doesn't close after its done, so I need to chain with |q.. But doing "TSUpdateSync|q" gives the same error:  Parser not available for language |q.  Am I missing something?

[23:56:39] <kambe[m]> Is there a way to make Neovim to use virtual lines instead of physical ones without remapping half of it?
[23:57:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> what're you trying to achieve?
[23:57:48] <gpanders> prg: you can use -c more than once
[23:57:56] <gpanders> nvim -c TSUpdateSync -c q
[23:59:15] <kambe[m]> sunjon: I want to make it all line navigation commands (j, k, arrows) to use virtual lines. Or at least arrows.
[23:59:32] <kambe[m]> Including parts of scripts.
