[00:13:53] <zleap> hey seabass 
[00:14:06] <zleap> how are things, long time no chat
[00:14:22] <seabass> hello zleap :)
[00:14:44] <seabass> doing well thanks; I'm working on my talk for this weekend
[00:16:15] <zleap> cool
[00:16:52] <seabass> currently trying to find a high-resolution photograph of a 90s personal computer running FreeBSD :D 
[00:17:15] <seabass> at this rate I'd be better off just installing it on the 90s PC I actually have myself and photographing that!

[05:46:50] <lumberjack123> Can anyone say how much this Microsoft patent might affect JPEG XL's otherwise royalty-free status: https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/17/microsoft_ans_patent/
[05:52:31] <lumberjack123> I also cannot tell if Google or Cloudinary have patents on this format and are licensing it royalty-free or what

[05:53:43] <lumberjack123> implementation.
[05:54:01] <lumberjack123> So if you MODIFY the library then you have no patent protections???

[05:57:34] <jxself> That's not what it't saying. If you make a change, and that change somehow infringes some other patent Google has, you don't get a license for that.
[05:58:12] <jxself> You only get a license only for "those patent claims, both currently owned or controlled by Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by this implementation of JPEG XL"
[06:01:14] <jxself> Say "this implementation of JPEG XL" is somehow incomplete. Maybe you work to built out more support for the standard. Or whatever. The only patent license you got was for that implementation as it was, not for what you make it into.

[15:49:06] <DiffieHellman> With a printer and conductive ink one can print a circuit board mind you.
[15:49:37] <Andrew> Exactly, and you can use some type of 3d printing (though currently very expensive) to make (bad) chips
[15:49:47] <Andrew> The microchips are the issue
[15:50:04] <Andrew> You can print PCB, you can 3d print cases and stuff, you can't make chips
[15:50:54] <DiffieHellman> If only all the FGPA designs didn't have all the patents on them.

[15:51:39] <Andrew> Are they like 20 years now?

[15:55:54] <DiffieHellman> Patents aren't actually useful for small businesses or individuals anymore anyway - it only helps big businesses with thosands of them.
[15:56:33] <Andrew> Can you elaborate on that?
[15:57:01] <DiffieHellman> Getting a patent really just costs you money for no gain unless you win the lottery.
[15:57:22] <DiffieHellman> Patents are an expensive lottery and big businesses can win every time due to their size
[15:58:05] <DiffieHellman> If a big business "violates" your patent, they are going to do their best to invalidate it and throughly discover patents that they feel like you violate.

[15:58:49] <DiffieHellman> It doesn't matter if you actually violate one of their patents, if they feel like you do and put enough money behind, you effectively are. 
[15:59:51] <AwesomeAdam54321> And that can be easy when some  of the patents are very vague
[16:00:05] <DiffieHellman> One example was Lexra, who figured out how to produce a MIPS processor that ran faster than the official processors, but made sure not to implement certain instructions as such instructions had patents on them.
[16:00:59] <DiffieHellman> They decided to raise an exception on these unsupported instructions rather than make them NOPS (with is pretty much the same thing). 
[16:01:17] *** Joins: TheLinuxNerd (~tux@user/thelinuxnerd)
[16:02:04] <DiffieHellman> The court still treated this as a patent violation, as it was possible for future customers to write a exception handler that implemented the instructions (never mind that you can do a similar thing just in software, but a little solwer).

[16:19:29] <TheLinuxNerd> I think the philosophy against proprietary software is a bit over the top, I use some proprietary stuff, but of course free software that is both gratis & liberating is the best
[16:19:51] <DiffieHellman> The uname function is meant to return the OS name, but for some reason glibc defers to the kernel when it comes to the OS name. Linux of course goes ahead and provides "Linux".
[16:20:20] <DiffieHellman> TheLinuxNerd: Proprietary software is not morally legitimate pretty much.
[16:20:35] <TheLinuxNerd> I tend to rank it, free software 100% good, open source software 75% good, 25% bad, proprietary software 50% good, 50% bad, proprietary software made by Microsoft  100% bad
[16:20:55] <DiffieHellman> Each proprietary program is an instrument of unjust power and if you choose to use it, you give yourself up to such unjust power.

[16:22:03] <Andrew> TheLinuxNerd: I'm kinda against the modern economy, so I don't like that
[16:22:09] <DiffieHellman> There is some proprietary software that is technically powerful, but the problem is that such program is probably malware and gives you none of the 4 freedoms, and therefore unusable.

[16:26:44] <Andrew> the licenses are not software
[16:27:08] <TheLinuxNerd> Andrew, I mean software licensed under MIT/X11 is free
[16:27:21] <DiffieHellman> The expat license is a free software license, but it is a pushover, non copyleft license that doesn't deal with patents.
[16:27:32] <TheLinuxNerd> I was thinking of LGPL anyway
[16:27:35] <GNUmer> Any restriction on software is unjust unless it is enforced to keep free software free.

[17:12:43] <bittin> Andrew, yeah :p
[17:12:59] <catt[m]> What is libreplanet
[17:13:46] <bittin> https://libreplanet.org/2022/ FSFs yearly conference
[17:14:50] <catt[m]> Is it online or in person?
[17:14:57] <catt[m]> Lgi
[17:14:58] <bittin> online
[17:15:01] <AwesomeAdam54321> catt[m] 
[17:15:07] <AwesomeAdam54321> catt[m]: online
[17:15:21] <catt[m]> Oh, ok
[17:15:26] <bittin> used to be psychial in USA but now it been Online 2-3 times
[17:15:35] <catt[m]> That explains why i couldnt find any info on where it was located
[17:15:47] <catt[m]> bittin: Online is better i think
[17:16:14] <catt[m]> For a big event, a lot of people probably want to go but cant because of it's location being likely far away
[17:17:04] <catt[m]> So its good to have it online where everyone can see it from anywhere in the world
[17:17:08] <bittin> well true but it makes sense having FSFs Conference in the US as its an US assication there is also FSFE for Europe, but now its been only for the past 2-3 years
[17:17:30] <catt[m]> So how do you stream it

[17:18:34] <catt[m]> bittin: Awesome
[17:18:39] <Andrew> it might be posted as ascii animations on irc
[17:18:40] <Andrew> jk
[17:18:56] <catt[m]> And thatll be in the libreplanet.org site, right?
[17:18:58] <bittin> not sure if you have to sign up to watch them or the streams is public (pretty sure some FSF person would know)
[17:19:17] <catt[m]> bittin: They should be public
[17:19:30] <catt[m]> Id assume?
[17:19:34] <Andrew> obviously public lol
[17:20:05] <catt[m]> If it was private then thatd be a little hypocritical
[17:20:35] <catt[m]> Since for it to be private you would have to have a form of DRM
[17:20:43] <bittin> was more thinking if FSF would want your email to send the newsletter etc, but i guess its fine :p
[17:21:09] <catt[m]> Well whatever the link to it is cant be unique 
[17:21:35] <catt[m]> I should sign up to the newsletter though

[17:26:50] <catt[m]> Confused, lol
[17:26:58] <AwesomeAdam54321> catt[m]: Paying means you help support the FSF, anyone can attend
[17:27:07] <bittin> catt[m], that you sponsor the FSF, and you can also buy a shirt? :p
[17:27:15] <catt[m]> Oh ok
[17:27:21] <jxself> Benefits of being an Associate Member: https://www.fsf.org/associate/
[17:27:52] <jxself> They don't seem to mention that warm inner glow you get from knowing you're supporting the free software movement in that way. :)

[17:28:28] <catt[m]> jxself: Yeah

[17:30:15] <tojil> Consider becoming a member
[17:30:25] <carmela> Does anyone know the irc channel names for the live libreplanet presentations. Will a browser (e.g., abrowser) be sufficient to view live presentations?
[17:30:33] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[17:30:39] <jxself> Historically a browser has been fine.
[17:30:56] <jxself> I expect that we will see the exact IRC channel names once the conference begins.
[17:31:25] <jxself> Typically they become visible on https://libreplanet.org/2022/ once the button to watch live is added.
[17:31:41] <bittin> carmela, #libreplanet for the general channel atleast
[17:31:43] <catt[m]> tojil: I will eventually
[17:32:04] <carmela> Thanks, jxself. I do wish that FSF was more forthcoming with information for conference participation, especially since it's presumably trying attract new free software users. 
[17:32:19] <catt[m]> But ill also try to help other ways whenever i get the opportunity 
[17:32:45] <carmela> Preaching to the choir isn't enough, but that seems to be FSF strategery.
[17:33:34] <catt[m]> wdym by that?
[17:33:44] <qrpnxz> donating to FSF has made me feel worse about the things I think they do wrong since I now have a personal stake
[17:34:08] <carmela> I don't think that FSF outreach is effective.
[17:34:10] <isf> a question, LibrePlanet 2022 Registration is needed for see the presentations?
[17:34:19] <catt[m]> I think that contributing things other than money can often help more
[17:34:56] <catt[m]> Like helping free software with development/documentation
[17:35:04] <catt[m]> Doesnt directly help the FSF but it helps the cause
[17:35:40] <qrpnxz> i've amassed a collection of bookmarks for logos, marks, and propaganda you can use to raise awareness of fsf and its campaigns. Your word of mouth if very important way to to contribute that is not money.
[17:36:20] <catt[m]> Yes

[17:42:17] <carmela> Money helps. Word of mouth helps. Running complete software helps. What does FSF actually do? I'm an associate member, but they've run the same old tired campaign for at least 10 years.
[17:42:28] <catt[m]> AwesomeAdam54321: Well, i didnt change it. The old wifi card is still in it
[17:42:39] <catt[m]> I just put in a pcmcia/cardbus wifi card
[17:42:43] <carmela> The conference talks look like the same old rehash, preaching to the choir. 
[17:43:06] <catt[m]> The intel internal card is no longer detected but that cardbus card works great
[17:43:53] <catt[m]> I still kept the AUR since parabola is missing a few packages but i checked and know that all the packages from it are free software
[17:43:55] <qrpnxz> i believe the express purpose of libreplanet is for freedom advocate to organize amongst each other. For such talks to serve well as outside promotion would be a side effect then (like when snowden showed up)
[17:44:02] <tojil> catt[m]: I thought about Libreboot when you mentioned other ways of helping. I become a member at thesame time I was already librebooting some machines by myself. 
[17:44:13] <kompowiec2> > The install fest would tolerate the devil's presence but not officially sponsor the devil, or publicize the devil's availability. Therefore, the users who accept the devil's deal would clearly see that the devil installed the nonfree drivers, not the install fest. The install fest would not be morally compromised by the devil's actions, so it could retain full moral authority when it talks about the imperative for freedom.

[17:45:30] <catt[m]> As a business or something like that
[17:45:40] <qrpnxz> carmela, if you have tips on what fsf can do better to reach people without spending crazy money on ads, i'd like to hear
[17:45:49] <carmela> qrpnxz: My point is that we are already organized amongst each other. I'm looking forward to the talks, but I believe the free software movement is effectively dead.
[17:46:03] <catt[m]> I never librebooted before but it was easier than i thought
[17:46:10] <catt[m]> Just time consuming
[17:46:31] <catt[m]> Docs are hard to sort through so thats what made it confusing for me
[17:46:35] <qrpnxz> mmm, if we were going more and more proprietary, or worse patent law, I'd agree, but I don't think it's like that.
[17:46:37] <carmela> It hasn't expanded in the 12+ years I've been using free software. Very little has changed. 
[17:46:49] <carmela> I won
[17:46:51] <carmela> I wpon
[17:46:56] <kompowiec2> <qrpnxz> carmela, if you have tips on what fsf can do better to reach people without spending crazy money on ads, i'd like to hear
[17:46:57] <kompowiec2> the only thing that comes to my mind is extreme marketing.
[17:47:09] <carmela> I won't go proprietary. If that's the only option at some point, I won
[17:47:15] <carmela> I won
[17:47:21] <carmela> I won't use computers.
[17:47:30] <carmela> Marketing won
[17:47:40] <kompowiec2> like redbull
[17:47:40] <qrpnxz> i think in 12 years there's a lot more free software, and the linux desktop experience is far better (which is easier to sell whether for freedom or otherwise)
[17:47:42] <carmela> Marketing won't help. 
[17:47:49] <carmela> I don
[17:48:05] <catt[m]> A lot of people are getting into linux now due to windows being so blatantly horrible and doing things not even the most loyal windows user can defend
[17:48:17] <catt[m]> So i think some of those people will find the FSF easier
[17:48:20] <tojil> carmela: I am a member also, not for so long. I guess you are right regarding LibrePlanet participation - I mean, the schedule seems just fine, but I can't find in the website where exactly I can participate / watch live.
[17:48:24] <carmela> I don't. Very little substantial has actually changed. Incremental improvements, yes. 
[17:48:32] <catt[m]> Already being in the linux area and all
[17:48:49] <carmela> tojil: FSF seems to be more about keeping itself going, rather than change.
[17:48:51] <catt[m]> Its indirect advertising, but it does help somewhat
[17:48:55] <tojil> catt[m]: yeah, could be. I flashed some chips for KGPE-D16 for example
[17:49:14] <qrpnxz> i do think fsf need to embrace open hardware because it's a significant loss you have to use old (and getting older) hardware to do free, backdoor-less, computing
[17:49:27] <tojil> carmela: dunno how we could be part of key decision change to move things better
[17:49:30] <catt[m]> libreboot is easy when you have the board out and the pomona clips, lol
[17:49:33] <Andrew> qrpnxz: Yes, that stops a lot of people from free computing.
[17:49:36] <kompowiec2> tojil, yeah. It all depends on how big the lanyard they put on the users. Currently, no company in Poland uses embed google maps on the website, only OSM due to license fees.
[17:49:38] <tojil> and some thinkpads too
[17:49:58] <Andrew> I'm perfectly okay using any hardware later than 1997 and before 2008, but many people are not. 
[17:50:18] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: The framework laptop looks interesting to me
[17:50:28] <catt[m]> Im not interested in it right now, but it has potential
[17:50:29] <AwesomeAdam54321> My Thinkpad is at least 10 years old and second hand
[17:50:58] <catt[m]> The hardware freedoms side of it is already covered, but some things have a way to go
[17:51:05] <catt[m]> Like coreboot support
[17:51:14] <qrpnxz> wym by "covered"
[17:51:27] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: It has good hardware freedom

[17:51:59] <qrpnxz> ah you are talking about framework
[17:52:03] <catt[m]> It has potential
[17:52:08] <qrpnxz> yeah it does
[17:52:15] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Yes
[17:52:49] <catt[m]> Framework can only get better from here
[17:53:23] <catt[m]> But im not going to go and buy it until its got all free software working smoothly
[17:53:54] <catt[m]> Using a free software wifi card, if it lacks one, is easy if i had to guess since you assemble it
[17:54:01] <qrpnxz> even if framework get that last bit of non-free stuff sorted out, idk if fsf can promote it. I mean, it will be an improvement over similarly spec'd laptops, but all modern x86 cpu are Defective by Design, so like, does the FSF say, "check this out, but watch out, it's very spooked" or does it have to decide it's just not ok
[17:54:11] <carmela> I'm perfectly happy with my 14 year old X200 and T400. What happens when these are no longer available? They won't last forever?
[17:54:50] <catt[m]> carmela: I have a T400

[18:02:03] <TheLinuxNerd> I agree, FSF message is too old, too radical for vast adoption
[18:02:15] <notdaniel> cat: as long as we keep making faster computers there will be slower ones
[18:02:32] <notdaniel> TheLinuxNerd: wdym?
[18:02:36] <qrpnxz> i don't think music compression is getting much faster, so for a big workload on that i'll still want the main machine i think. Same for video encoding, code compilation, big db queries
[18:02:49] <catt[m]> notdaniel: Yes but its getting to the point where i realistically cannot comprehend what they can innovate on
[18:02:53] <qrpnxz> otherwise sure
[18:02:59] <TheLinuxNerd> notdaniel, instead of aiming to get people to go Trisquel (Libre Linux)
[18:03:17] <qrpnxz> trisquel is so bad, idk why that's the main recommendation
[18:03:19] <TheLinuxNerd> we should be happy if they replace Photoshop with GIMP or make some minor progress towards free
[18:03:23] <catt[m]> Modern nvidia gpus are so unnecessarily fast that there is nothing that requires anything more demanding
[18:03:28] <qrpnxz> guix or parabola better imo

[18:04:07] <qrpnxz> notdaniel, actually, modern encoding are more efficient :), but more resolution = more bandwidth as always ofc
[18:04:18] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Why is it derived from ubuntu
[18:04:22] <TheLinuxNerd> we gotta appeal to people nowadays, I'd make a better looking CSS3,HTML5 FSF.org
[18:04:29] <notdaniel> TheLinuxNerd: I mean the message is basically just use free software
[18:04:44] <catt[m]> I dont understand whats different from debian and ubuntu and then why any distro would want to base on ubuntu
[18:04:50] <TheLinuxNerd> notdaniel, yes, but the message actually is "use only free software, everything else is wrong"
[18:04:53] <notdaniel> They make a point of only promoting the free-est of software but still
[18:05:06] <qrpnxz> ubuntu actually good UX, trisquel feel terrible and hangs
[18:05:07] <TheLinuxNerd> instead of "free software is nice, use it, if you can"
[18:05:26] <catt[m]> notdaniel: I guess?
[18:05:27] <TheLinuxNerd> a more moderate approach, is more successful

[18:08:40] <TheLinuxNerd> notdaniel, I'm proposing a FSF that advocates for usage of free software, but a less extreme community
[18:08:52] <notdaniel> Hmm
[18:08:59] <TheLinuxNerd> for instance, the most people here probably use some ThinkPad with libreboot from years and years ago
[18:09:04] <catt[m]> Join us now and share the software
[18:09:11] <TheLinuxNerd> that will never appeal to young people, or to most people 
[18:09:20] <carmela> There is no partly or partially free. Either you run free or you don't. That's not extremism. That's ethics.
[18:09:26] <notdaniel> I mean, in practice I think using free software is sort of a virtue, and takes years to get good at, sadly
[18:09:33] <catt[m]> I am a young person
[18:09:41] <notdaniel> cat: me too
[18:09:41] <qrpnxz> TheLinuxNerd, FSF has a freedom ladder campaign. For "young people" there's plenty of creative software and free social networks.
[18:10:03] <catt[m]> A good method for sharing free software is making jokes about it, seriously
[18:10:04] <tojil> TheLinuxNerd: I am personally happy with any advancement towards GNU/Linux or free software alternatives such as GIMP which can run in other OSes too, but I disagree in a broader collectively level. We definitely should "cancel" somebody if they are not running perfect 100% free software and hardware, but we should'nt transmit the message that using GIMP is enough. And we can't give up on what differs
[18:10:06] <tojil> FSF from OSI, I guess.
[18:10:20] <catt[m]> People mocking free software is good, though they might laugh at it that makes more people see it
[18:10:27] <TheLinuxNerd> tojil, exactly
[18:10:50] <tojil> We definitely SHOULDN'T*** sorry
[18:10:52] <tojil> hahahaaha
[18:10:52] <TheLinuxNerd> and we shouldn't strive for Free software at the cost of usability or appeal. I'll be honest, fsf.org looks like it's from the 90s
[18:11:12] <qrpnxz> people mock basic realities like "copying is not theft", so there's a lot of programming to unlearn.
[18:11:16] <catt[m]> TheLinuxNerd: Good. 90s was peak design
[18:11:28] <carmela> Until there is a free software phone, which doesn't seem likely, younger people won't be on board.
[18:11:44] <TheLinuxNerd> well there is google android
[18:11:48] <catt[m]> carmela: Pinephone someday maybe

[18:14:14] <catt[m]> Some people dont need it anyways
[18:15:01] <tojil> TheLinuxNerd: regarding Libreboot, I guess more people could be interested and would be happy to use best current thinkpad options. I could get young people interested and aware of its importance. We fail in propaganda since ever? Also, the culture in Europe and USA is of selling expensive librebooted, recognized by FSF and whatever... I mean, come on, those prices are usually out of reality. We could
[18:15:03] <tojil> have libreboot excellent options for fair prices in many places, but we don't because people librebooting seem to feel they are too much of a special market.
[18:15:15] <TheLinuxNerd> honestly, if some little blob of proprietary modem firmware ruins your Android experience ...
[18:15:19] <qrpnxz> samsung use restricted boot defect to keep free software out, others like google don't

[18:17:02] <carmela> I'm paraphrasing
[18:17:03] <catt[m]> I understand how cellular is easy to triangulate
[18:17:07] <TheLinuxNerd> because for every 1 in 100 people, that refuses to use all and any proprietary software, there are 90 people that love proprietary software and 9 that have a moderate view
[18:17:30] <catt[m]> But what does his whole thing about remotely enabled spy switch mean
[18:18:10] <TheLinuxNerd> so, long story short, in my opinion the FSF needs to be more tolerant towards non-free software (cause it's the reality we live in) and attempt to thus capture the attention of those living in proprietary-land

[18:49:16] <isf> A nonfree program is an injustice. To distribute a nonfree program, to recommend a nonfree program to other people, or more generally steer them into a course that leads to using nonfree software, means leading them to give up their freedom. To be sure, leading people to use nonfree software is not the same as installing nonfree software in their computers, but we should not lead people in the wrong direction.
[18:49:20] <notdaniel> Lol I have a lot of stories about travel without a cell phone

[18:49:58] <notdaniel> I live in a pretty rural area and drive cars from the 80s to avoid nonfree software
[18:50:00] <isf> At a deeper level, we must not present a nonfree program as a solution because that would grant it legitimacy. Nonfree software is a problem; to present it as a solution denies the existence of the problem.

[19:25:31] <isf> Only running free software you can keep your freedom. That mean always say no to nonfree software. 
[19:25:34] <TheLinuxNerd> you just have Steam & DRM 
[19:25:39] <catt[m]> Maximalist: Yes
[19:25:44] <catt[m]> That is exactly what happens
[19:25:48] <PCITechie> isf: I disagree. Running steam on GNU/Linux is more free than running it on Windows
[19:25:48] <catt[m]> Im not sure why you ask isf
[19:26:02] <Maximalist> So having Steam on my GNU build is on the same level as running full blown windows bloatware?
[19:26:05] <kompowiec2> isf, iirc steam now allows to choose by creator whether he wants to be DRM protected and whether you can run the game with or without steam.
[19:26:06] <catt[m]> PCITechie: Either way, its a game market
[19:26:08] <isf> if are more malware or not
[19:26:18] <PCITechie> its not fully free, but its not fully nonfree either, it doesn't change the fact you run a free distribution with mainly free utilities and programs
[19:26:18] <isf> isnt important if your system have 5% of malware or 1%
[19:26:26] <isf> becouse malware always can attack you
[19:26:32] <kompowiec2> that doesn't mean I justify it in some way. I'm just informing
[19:26:34] <catt[m]> I will disagree with fsf here when i say that i will never pay directly to acquire software
[19:26:59] <isf> more if you cant recognice what are realy doing the software, becouse are completly propietary and you dont have control of it, thats the reason you lose your freedom

[19:28:58] <isf> i only run free software, so all i have to do with their is just promotion of it, for example is i have a friend to want use software who compare my freedom to the trash i say to him, "thanks, but no with that software, please use with me XMPP" for example.

[19:35:01] <ggoes> just spaceship earth
[19:35:11] <catt[m]> TheLinuxNerd: Publishers often refer to copying they don't approve of as “piracy.” In this way, they imply that it is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on the high seas, kidnapping and murdering the people on them. Based on such propaganda, they have procured laws in most of the world to forbid copying in most (or sometimes all) circumstances. (They are still pressuring to make these prohibitions more complete.) 
[19:35:11] <catt[m]> If you don't believe that copying not approved by the publisher is just like kidnapping and murder, you might prefer not to use the word “piracy” to describe it. Neutral terms such as “unauthorized copying” (or “prohibited copying” for the situation where it is illegal) are available for use instead. Some of us might even prefer to use a positive term such as “sharing information with your neighbor.”
[19:35:11] <catt[m]> A US judge, presiding over a trial for copyright infringement, recognized that “piracy” and “theft” are smear words.
[19:35:27] <aindilis> hey guys, I have a question about piracy.  https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY

[19:36:02] <aindilis> j/k, my actual question is something that has been bothering me for a while.  I realize that "IP" is a specious concept, certainly.
[19:36:08] <kompowiec2> isf, you know I think you would like the public channel matrix midov.pl, they have a bot called RMS where it automatically warns other people against bad words.

[19:36:25] <gnoo> https://peertube.tv/w/x2LLL5sS6vGk1X16KtZgEn
[19:36:31] <aindilis> it's clearly not "theft"

[19:36:46] <catt[m]> Only the insane, paranoid or misinformed wont
[19:36:47] <aindilis> however I cannot quite shake from my mind the argument I came up with that so-called "piracy" is "theft-of-service".

[19:41:46] <aindilis> no, but I plan to become involved, and the fact that there is now a small FRDCSA community makes it a lot easier
[19:41:51] <craigt> aindilis: As long as your project is freely licensed, it can be added to the FSD.
[19:41:52] <TheLinuxNerd> Noisytoot, I get paid even if you don't click ad
[19:42:01] <aindilis> yeah, that's why I need the compliance checking tools :)
[19:42:03] <TheLinuxNerd> it makes difference if you don't see the ad at all,

[19:46:48] <TheLinuxNerd> Noisytoot, I'm simply playing the role of most media creators ... their mindsets
[19:46:50] <kompowiec2> <TheLinuxNerd> so if I write a book, I have to give it away for free and not prevent who can have it
[19:46:51] <kompowiec2> you know what's interesting? That book lobbyists hate digital books for the possibility of pirating them, but not for printing them anymore. I think their intentions become clear ...
[19:47:02] <PCITechie> TheLinuxNerd: I know this is FSD time and don't really want to contribute to this offtopic conversation rn but if you want people to be forced to use the nonfree youtube client, because you need it to make money, perhaps look at other methods for earning.
[19:47:41] <Maximalist> does fsd keep software that is out of date and can no longer be used?

[19:51:18] <kompowiec2> craigt, in linux world, poor backwards compatibility. A good example would be the free printer drivers from 2004 which I am unable to compile on modern linux.
[19:51:23] <AwesomeAdam54321> TheLinuxNerd: The Free Software Directory Meeting is for discussing things related to the it
[19:51:27] <craigt> TheLinuxNerd: It is a weekly meeting where we work on the Free Software Directory.

[19:56:46] <kompowiec2> it's not a impossible problem, but it can be very annoying

[20:15:55] <qrpnxz> there's going to be a lot of general conversation here. Last week someone made a complain about messages i sent, and cited the fact that a meeting was going on. Well this is basically the town square of free software chat, so i was only able to take that somewhat seriously. All meeting logs (i assume there are such) are going to have a lot of stuff not relevant to the meeting. Making an irc channel and pointing people who want 
[20:15:55] <qrpnxz> to be involved in that is really trivial and really that's the purpose of channels so seems like the logical course of action.

[20:22:34] <panosalevro> hello
[20:22:58] <kompowiec2> hey
[20:23:09] <qrpnxz> craigt, i understand, and i understand it has been done like that 10 years and chances of changing it are basically zero because much like plan 9, the alternative is not sufficiently better for anybody to care, but that's just my thought and thanks for listening.
[20:23:30] <Maximalist> Noisytoot: did i upload a file?
[20:23:30] <fuat2mb> "every Friday 12:00-15:00EDT. " craigt isn't that now
[20:23:39] <qrpnxz> yes, lmao

[20:27:02] <GNUmer> craigt: If it's accessible with no JavaScript, the first 3 screenshots from https://taisei-project.org/media would suffice.
[20:27:04] <carmela> gimp is a derogatory term for a physically disabled person; it is offensive
[20:27:05] * craigt is looking at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Taisei
[20:27:42] <qrpnxz> coincidentally gimp is a homonym for gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program
[20:28:06] <carmela> you think it's coincidental; naive
[20:28:25] <labrador_> carmela, the world takes offense too quickly nowadays

[20:29:11] <craigt> carmela: Hello. Welcome to this week's Free Software Directory meeting.
[20:29:16] <qrpnxz> lol
[20:29:19] <PCITechie> carmela: Have you any evidence otherwise?
[20:29:45] <kompowiec2> PCITechie, it doesn't matter because it's genetic fallacy.
[20:30:04] *** Joins: PacMiam (~PacMiam@user/pacmiam)
[20:30:07] <PCITechie> To me it is more logical that the name GIMP originated from its constituent words "GNU Image Manipulation Program", rather than those words being made from the acronym
[20:30:33] <carmela> gimp has been an offensive term for 100 years; it's like calling someone a 'crip', a 'cripple or crippled'
[20:30:49] <Noisytoot> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP#History
[20:30:59] <fsdbot> We're are entering the second hour of the Free Software Directory meeting. If it is your first time joining us, please check out the participation guide: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[20:31:00] <gnoo> taisei is already available on guix !
[20:31:17] <Noisytoot> "In 1995, Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis began developing GIMP – originally named General Image Manipulation Program – as a semester-long project at the University of California, Berkeley for the eXperimental Computing Facility. The acronym was coined first, with the letter G being added to -IMP as a reference to "the gimp" in the scene from the 1994 Pulp Fiction film."
[20:31:25] <carmela> I've heard it used many times in nearly 60 years. Quite frankly, that's enough evidence.
[20:31:39] <craigt> carmela: That's a fair assessment, but we are currently hosting the Free Software Directory meeting.
[20:31:46] <qrpnxz> "It took us a little while to come up with the name. We knew we wanted an image manipulation program like Photoshop, but the name IMP sounded wrong. We also tossed around XIMP (X Image Manipulation Program) following the rule of when in doubt prefix an X for X11 based programs. At the time, Pulp Fiction was the hot movie and a single word popped into my mind while we were tossing out name ideas. It only took a few more minutes 
[20:31:46] <qrpnxz> to determine what the 'G' stood for."
[20:31:49] <Noisytoot> https://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it
[20:32:09] <qrpnxz> LOL
[20:32:46] <qrpnxz> good response from the gimp ppl
[20:32:59] <qrpnxz> didn't expect it to be faq worthy
[20:33:01] <carmela> Wouldn't it make sense to have 'meetings' in a dedicated space. #fsf has had general conversation ongoing since this morning.
[20:33:02] <kompowiec2> Get the fork out ;)
[20:33:19] <luna_> kompowiec2, someone already did that
[20:33:20] <qrpnxz> carmela, yeah, i was just talking about that :)
[20:33:22] <luna_> Glimpse for example
[20:33:25] <kompowiec2> yeah
[20:33:28] <kompowiec2> win win

[20:34:27] * craigt is still looking at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Taisei
[20:34:30] <PCITechie> what has it done that it says not to>
[20:34:31] <Avron> in https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection:GNU/Linux, can we add a category "Digital photo processor" with Darktable and Rawtherapee, as replacement of Lightroom?
[20:34:42] <carmela> Anyway, 'gimp' could be a coincidence.
[20:34:54] *** Quits: ml| (~ml|@user/ml/x-5298235) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:35:08] <carmela> I don't need to reprimanded for participating in a conversation when there is a 'meeting.' 
[20:35:31] <craigt> carmela: It is not a reprimand. I am asking people to be courteous.
[20:35:35] <kompowiec2> carmela, you can ask Putin to change a name, he seems to have withdrawn trademark protection ;)
[20:35:36] <carmela> If it's too busy, have your meeting elsewhere. Asking everyone who's been online since before the 'meeting' to take a hike is rude.
[20:35:39] <qrpnxz> it's a coincidence to be offended by it since that's not the intent :)
[20:35:40] <craigt> We are hosting a meeting
[20:36:15] <craigt> carmela: It is a schedule meeting, held every week
[20:36:17] <Avron> in https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection:Replicant, I am a litle confused about the "Online storage" category. Nextcloud is listed as free software but here, it appers as something to be replaces. Why?
[20:36:21] <luna_> sorry
[20:36:23] <gnoo> takisei is nice, doesn't even require mouse lol
[20:36:26] <PCITechie> carmela: the way you say 'meeting' makes it seem like you don't think its actually a meeting, or at least one worth having
[20:37:17] <carmela> I'm sure the meeting is worth having. How is having another discussion discourteous?
[20:37:50] <PCITechie> because its hard to separate meeting from general conversation when both are happening at once
[20:37:59] <craigt> carmela: It is distracting. I can't look away from the channel to get work done because I am moderating the meeting.
[20:38:00] <PCITechie> this is a tiny fraction of a week
[20:38:14] <PCITechie> its not hard to read when it is
[20:38:33] <carmela> It's chat - typically characterized by multiple running conversations. Anyway, enjoy your meeting. Lunch time.
[20:38:36] <PCITechie> 3/168 of a week to be precise
[20:38:38] <qrpnxz> it's actually really easy, you just make another channel, but other than that sure.
[20:38:38] <Avron> about Nextcloud for replicant, is it because only the GNU/Linux client was checked?
[20:38:53] <craigt> PCITechie: Nice calculation!
[20:39:43] <craigt> Avron: I'm not sure.
[20:39:54] *** Joins: galex-713 (~quassel@galex-713.eu)

[20:44:36] <craigt> Avron: Hrm.. I wonder if it would be best to have three separate entries for nextcloud. Server, GNU/Linux client, and android client. Let me finish up with https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Taisei and I can take a closer look. Maybe there are other similar entries we can compare.

[22:43:12] <jacobk> Taisei is indeed quite difficult. I reccomend starting on easy and practicing individual sections a lot, until you can consistently avoid getting hit. The documentation says to pay attention to scoring, but even after reading it multiple times I don't fully understand, so I think the simplest strategy is just to avoid getting hit entirely.
[22:44:22] <Maximalist> are there any free alternatives to programs like grammarly?

[22:52:06] <jacobk> "Texts are securely stored" (https://languagetool.org/) also makes it sound like it's SaaSS, but it's not explicit about it so I'm not sure.

[22:56:37] <PCITechie> LanguageTool is a browser extension it seems. I don't really see it being feasible translating locally with an extension, so it is almost certainly SaaSS
[22:57:01] <PCITechie> not translation
[22:57:12] <PCITechie> i thought it was a translator lol
[22:57:27] <PCITechie> ill peek at the source code and check if it is SaaSS

[23:07:02] <jacobk> The boundary between acceptable SaaSS and unacceptable SaaSS is somewhat unclear to me. Is it acceptable if it's also possible to run an offline instance at the cost of more processing power?

[23:10:12] <PCITechie> SaaSS as a whole shouldn't exist
[23:11:02] <kompowiec2> qrpnxz, interesting. I also have own file with words wchich i avoided. For example "should" because in 99% cases it's is-ought problem
[23:11:21] <qrpnxz> should is just ought

[23:22:28] <jacobk> PCITechie: So, if some people don't have a powerful enough computer to compute good translations or good grammar checking, do you think it is wrong for a company to offer that as a service (while also sharing their server software so anyone else can run a competing service or run everything locally)?
[23:22:28] <jacobk> It seems like there might be some tasks that are infeasible to run on most computers today, but which supercomputers can run well (I'm thinking of AI text generation). Should we avoid those types of activities completely until we can run them on our own computers?
[23:22:28] <qrpnxz> well that's a different meaning from the moral sense
[23:24:05] <jacobk> (I wouldn't want to give all my writing (for grammar checking), reading (for translating), or conversations with AI to a company, but I find it hard to place blame on the company if the reason I can't run the program locally is because of my hardware.
[23:24:08] <jacobk> )
[23:24:17] <lispmacs[work]> jacobk: I might just not here that the term SaaSS only applies to activities that you /can/ do on your own computer
[23:24:33] <lispmacs[work]> note here, I meant
[23:24:43] <qrpnxz> jacobk, i think RMS make a distinction that if you could run the program with enough resources then it's a SaaSS. I think that is flawed because with enough resources i could create a bank, or become google.
[23:25:16] <jacobk> Yes, there are lots of different computers, and some are more powerful than others.
[23:25:33] <lispmacs[work]> i think the main danger is Web service taking over things that you could do on your computer, like image editing
[23:26:00] <PCITechie> ^

[23:26:12] <lispmacs[work]> once you get to the place where you are doing all your image editing through a Web service, you no longer have control of your computing, when you could have
[23:26:23] <PCITechie> the amount of people I know who use "online" image editors is ridiculous

[23:27:29] <qrpnxz> although i agree you should have as much control over your life as possible (aka freedom), to me it's not an imperative to avoid service, nor that there's anything wrong with providing services.
[23:27:55] *** Joins: tsdh (~tsdh@j289989.servers.jiffybox.net)
[23:29:49] <jacobk> I can't find it now, but I remember reading a page where Stallman said not to ask people to do with a service anything they could "conceivably" do on their own computers, but that seems a bit too broad for me (I could conceivably run a search engine on my computer, but it wouldn't be a very good one.).
[23:29:49] <jacobk> I agree SaaSS image editing is silly in today's world.
[23:30:06] <lispmacs[work]> Web services are a sneaky, slippery way to get us hooked on proprietary software. Proprietary desktop software always comes with some installer program, and usually an explicit license/EULA agreement. But companies provide Web services as a way to get you hooked into their proprietary system through your Web browser, without even knowing what license it is or even what code you are running on a give page load
[23:31:10] <lispmacs[work]> the Web browser becomes the thin client OS to running all their code
[23:31:55] <PCITechie> A service, in my opinion, is something like a video hosting site, not a site which sends some code for your browser to blindly execute while having the aforementioned code send information to be processed by their servers.
[23:32:07] <kompowiec2> 2<qrpnxz2> can you give an example?
[23:32:08] <kompowiec2> you should have children / you shouldn't.
[23:32:15] <kompowiec2> as a form manipulation
[23:32:16] <qrpnxz> what would you say instead
[23:32:19] <jacobk> Sometimes I find myself using SaaSS without thinking about it, like when I type "24*60" or "concievably" into a search engine.
[23:32:24] <qrpnxz> manipulation? lol
[23:32:45] <PCITechie> jacobk: muscle memory?
[23:33:09] <PCITechie> in a way not fully obviously, just something you are used to doing so much you do it automatically?
[23:33:22] <lispmacs[work]> I would say there is a difference between a Web app and a data storage/streaming service
[23:34:02] <jacobk> PCITechie: Yes, mostly; recently I use Python for math but I'm not sure of a convenient local alternative for spellchecking (lots of large programs have it built-in, but a stand-alone commandline spellchecker would be useful for when it's missing from a program I use (e.g. Quassel IRC)).
[23:34:03] <lispmacs[work]> YouTube is both, because you aren't suppose to be able to view the videos at all, or even search for videos, without loading all their proprietary Web code
[23:34:20] <lispmacs[work]> thankfully there are some ways to get around that, sort of
[23:34:54] <lispmacs[work]> by Web code I meant download and run all their JavaScript
[23:35:31] <PCITechie> yeah youtube *is* both and thats bad
[23:36:01] <PCITechie> but you can easily bypass that and use a desktop client to download the videos, treating it as essentially a web server

[23:36:37] <notdaniel> Thank goodness for youtube-dl&co
[23:36:44] <lispmacs[work]> PCITechie: yes, sort of, thanks to youtube-dl. There is I guess some deeper technical questions there... I think youtube-dl has to run some of the javascript to get the URLs

[23:38:31] <zleap> evening
[23:38:46] <PCITechie> lispmacs[work]: It probably reads the javascript to find video URLs, however I highly doubt they have implemented a full javascript engine in youtube-dl
[23:41:09] *** Joins: mtlben (~quassel@modemcable132.204-56-74.mc.videotron.ca)
[23:42:00] <jacobk> lispmacs[work], PCITechie: youtube-dl downloads some JavaScript and interprets it using a custom interpreter that is not turing complete. I think it's okay, but I can understand why some people wouldn't.
[23:42:00] <jacobk> A fork called hypervideo exists that removes the JavaScript interpretation entirely, and for videos that require it (mostly VEVO and "Topic" music I think) it tries to get them from Invidious instead.
[23:42:47] <jacobk> (Wait, does that make hypervideo SaaSS because Invidious presumably has to interpret the JavaScript to get the video?)

[23:43:39] <PCITechie> Probably not
[23:44:18] <PCITechie> Because hypervideo itself is a program on your computer, though I guess the use of Invidious may change that
[23:44:38] <PCITechie> Doesn't apply to most videos anyways in that case
[23:45:02] <corwin> hi zleap!
[23:45:14] *** fling_ is now known as fling
[23:48:02] <jacobk> Apparently hypervideo is unknown enough that searching for it doesn't bring anything useful up, so if someone wants to find it they may want to know that it's included in HyperbolaOS (#hyperbola here on Libera.Chat).
