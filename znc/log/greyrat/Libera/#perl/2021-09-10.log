[07:35:05] <genio> There's no good way to convert from a hash ref to a set of SOAP headers given the many various depths they have and whatnot. I can leave it up to the caller to provide headers they've created to the methods they want with a hash key that's "reserved" with a dash like that. but eww
[07:35:27] <ether> XML::Compile::SOAP is the best if you have to wade into that quagmire
[07:36:49] <genio> yea, I'm stuck in SOAP::Lite because I don't have that time machine (I don't think XML::Compile::SOAP existed then) and then when it was still early enough to convert, there were so many issues with it and the Salesforce WSDL that I couldn't switch. then years and years went by. I can't easily alter the user's API now.

[07:39:42] <genio> this stupid design actually returns the SOAP::Lite response rather than parsing the responses and making hash refs for userland simplicity. that also locks me into that piss poor decision from nearly 20 years ago
[07:42:21] <pj> genio: I had to work with an API once that "claimed" to accept JSON, only the object keys had to be ordered or the API would barf.

[19:55:14] <xq> daemon: yes, I did some more research and this seems like an extremely difficult thing to pull off, requiring at the very least, migration of kernel structures, migration of application state, and reconfiguration of network interfaces along with changes to netfilter/snat/dnat rules
[19:55:30] <LeoNerd> Oh, yeah.. TCP handover is a hugely tricky problem
[19:55:36] <thrig> ^C goes to the foreground process group. so it depends on what that group is, whether ^C is being masked off, etc
[19:55:39] <LeoNerd> Some BSD machines have very special support for it, but in general, no you can't

[19:55:58] <xq> but it died looks like, and I can see why
[19:55:58] <LeoNerd> The modern solution is just not to rely on longlived TCP. Hence things like HTTP
[19:56:03] <Altreus> I even read a blog post on SIGINT
[19:56:10] <Altreus> and I still don't understand how to actually do it right
[19:56:13] <LeoNerd> Just accept that connections can be knifed and restarted again
[19:56:32] <xq> LeoNerd: from what I can gather, the modern solution to longlived TCP HA is to just handle disconnect gracefully and reconnect asap
[19:56:40] <Altreus> does $? tell me if it was killed?

[19:57:19] <daemon> xq, not sure if helpful but a fun trick is using a UDP vpn (like openvpn) to a load balancer and then out to your services, because UDP is lossy the vpn its self will allow the client to be on a dodgy connection and allow more room to re-establish any inband tcp connections. but perhaps not what you are looking for
[19:57:20] <LeoNerd> The bottom 7 bits

[19:57:55] <LeoNerd> thrig: unfortunately, not...
[19:58:09] <LeoNerd> The POSIX::W* macros are for operating on the OS-level waitpid exit status
[19:58:11] <Altreus> I'll use POSIX if I care more
[19:58:15] <LeoNerd> The $? variable has been bitshifted by perl
[19:58:26] <Altreus> then I won't :)
[19:58:36] <LeoNerd> The $? variable is *always* in the form where the top 8 bits are the exit code, then the bottom 8 bits are the term signal / coredump flag
[19:58:44] <LeoNerd> _even if_ the POSIX macros lay it out somehow differently
[19:59:16] <mst> realistically, the usual approaches are either for the server to use some sort of relatively fast datastore like redis that can be replicated to the client can reconnect to an identical looking session, or I guess you could find some way to keep the state on the client and hack it that way
[19:59:36] <mst> there's also stuff for moving entire virtual machines, I think VMotion is one of the proprietary ones

[20:12:53] <LeoNerd> I also don't see why it should take a CPU that can perform 2.4 _billion_ instructions every single second, should need anywhere near that 2.4 _billion_ instructions in a whole second just to make a keypress appear on the screen

[23:29:03] <gordonfish> Re: <daemon> youtube-dl and the -x option might be something you like though
[23:29:04] <gordonfish> daemon, LeoNerd: You could try something like `youtube-dl -f 140 -g <yt-video-id-or-url> | vlc -`, where 140 is the YT format code for audio only in mp4a [m4a_dash container, mp4a.40.2@129k (44100Hz)]
[23:29:29] <gordonfish> and -g produces a url instead of downloading
[23:29:38] <gordonfish> LeoNerd: Could also try to piping to cmus if it accepts urls

[23:32:22] <gordonfish> If you want audio only, then -f 140 seems to make much more sense than -x (which extracts audio from video/audio formats, which can be good as a fall back should a video not offer format 140, though that seem to be standard with all videos.)
