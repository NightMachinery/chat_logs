[03:49:25] <SineDeviance> The function keys are one thing, that's easy to work around by setting a post-reboot rtcwake command in cron. What has been really driving me nuts is the docking behavior. I use the lenovo USBC dock with two external displays, and half the time when I undock it doesn't get detected and the laptop screen stays blank. Other times, I dock and close the lid and the new layout is not detected, or it leaves the laptop screen as primary even though the

[06:11:26] <phogg> dman777_alter: think of your terminal like your monitor, and terminal configuration like changing settings in your monitor's settings panel. You can adjust color balance, brightness, etc. using the monitor controls. Later when a program asks for "red" it may or may not look red based on your changes.
[06:11:37] <jochum> greatcoof: you should find a way to run the failed upgrade -- maybe its just a system upgrade, yes.

[08:22:18] <Psi-Jack> But, it does, just work. That's kinda the point. If it doesn't work, then it literally ain't Airprint.
[08:22:20] <jochum> SineDeviance: Well you mean when the printer vendor doesn't make it to work, right?
[08:22:38] <ayecee> then there's a lot of things out there that are almost airprint but not quite airprint
[08:22:46] <SineDeviance> No, I mean when a printer has the AirPrint badge on it and it still doesn't work because of some change Apple made to AirPrint in some MacOS release
[08:23:03] <Psi-Jack> SineDeviance: Apple doesn't change AirPrint.
[08:23:06] <SineDeviance> I have stumbled on this problem a few times over the last decade and basically the answer ends up being "buy a new printer or stop using macs with this one"

[08:51:11] <jochum> But I have to say I like Brother a lot I would rather buy the Brother.
[08:51:13] <Psi-Jack> SineDeviance: I have had that happen...
[08:51:35] <SineDeviance> Yeah, if this keeps up I will have to try another distro or just go back to windows :/
[08:51:44] <SineDeviance> I can't have this happen in the middle of the workday
[08:51:46] <Psi-Jack> Negative. Just get more RAM.
[08:52:01] <SineDeviance> it's odd, just started happening this evening. I used this system all day for work and it went smoothly
[08:52:08] <jochum> "Brother MFC-L8900CDW" <-- this is the winner of all Color Lasers
[08:52:11] <Psi-Jack> Most likely that literally is the issue, you're swapping, running out of RAM.
[08:52:21] <jochum> Multi Function Printer color lasers
[08:52:24] <ayecee> with 16GB?
[08:52:29] <ayecee> that can't be right
[08:52:35] <SineDeviance> Psi-Jack: no way, I have 16 gig and I checked activity monitor a little while ago and I was only using 3.5gb or so
[08:52:43] <Psi-Jack> jochum: That's the one at my OfficeDepot. LOL
[08:52:44] <pnbeast> 16GB oughta be enough for anyone.
[08:52:57] <Psi-Jack> SineDeviance: I had 32GB, and saw it. Now I have 64GB, and never see it.
[08:53:00] <ayecee> oughta be enough for this one anyways
[08:53:26] <ayecee> but if he sees it again he's gonna put in 128GB just in case
[08:53:28] <SineDeviance> Psi-Jack: if you haven't ordered that other one yet I'd go to office depot and get the 8900CDW, that is a solid printer for the price and buying it from the store means easy return if you don't like it
[08:53:29] <Psi-Jack> So, either they fixed it, or more RAMs solves it. LOL
[08:53:42] <Psi-Jack> SineDeviance: Exactly!
[08:53:43] <SineDeviance> <Psi-Jack> SineDeviance: I had 32GB, and saw it. Now I have 64GB, and never see it. <-- that is stupid

[08:53:57] <Psi-Jack> I mean... It's true....
[08:54:01] <ayecee> i like to think it's a little joke
[08:54:08] <SineDeviance> No, I mean, I believe you! It's just stupid that it happens
[08:54:17] <Psi-Jack> It is, but it's true, too. :)

[10:49:57] <hexnewbie> A partition table is a good label on what's on the disk that's better recognized than a filesystem magic: Windows knows there's non-Windows data on there.
[10:50:13] <ayecee> jarthur: there's also a little concern that a disk without a partition table may be treated as unused by another OS.
[10:50:31] <jarthur> No worries at all, jochum. It took us both some time to come to the answer, the benefits of asking IRC instead of Google I think. Either way, I'm happy. I'm dealing with cloud drives instead of physical drives usually, so what the cloud is telling the OS driver layer is incredibly virtualized by the time it gets to me.

[10:51:45] <hexnewbie> Also, having 1 MiB of free space padding before the first partition would allow you to, um, add extra metadata in front, e.g. to lvmify or turn to bcache without moving the data one day :P
[10:52:17] <ayecee> jarthur: it's scarier, as an admin, to come across a system configured that way, because then you wonder what other kinds of oddball practices the previous admin had.
[10:52:22] <hexnewbie> Or add a BIOS grub partition (if boot loader is really tiny, EFI system partition can also fit)

[10:53:52] <hexnewbie> Partition tables have disadvantages as well, particularly on VMs: Growing a partition is less pleasant than growing the whole disk, can't find an automated tool for it, and it takes overly long to explain to someone how to do it, and they still do it wrong.
[10:54:18] <jochum> bigRoo: you could comment all those ppa's and see if upgrade works then.
[10:54:18] <bigRoo> ayecee: the error is about failed to fetch packages. I recall one of my PPAs has an expired key previously
[10:54:18] <hexnewbie> It's perfectly simple operation, but it is gotten wrong more often than not

[10:57:42] <ayecee> can't shrink xfs, another one
[10:57:44] <jarthur> ayecee well, in my case the admin after me won't be picking up my disks and wondering what's on them as their allocated space is released back to the ether when the virtual instance inevitably is terminated due to autoscaling, market conditions, etc. The Amazon and Google GUI tools for creating block devices are my partition table in effect.
[10:57:47] <jochum> hexnewbie: sometimes it requires a yes in between, sometimes it ask for bad filesystem if ouy want to ignore them
[10:58:00] <bigRoo> ayecee: yes I can give it a try. But what really puts me off is this post on Pop OS Forum: https://pop-planet.info/forums/threads/upgrade-stuck-from-18-04-to-20-04.923/page-3

[12:40:02] <PaulFertser> lopid: I'm providing a way to apply custom Xkb settings depending on the keyboard that's used.
[12:40:04] <sri19> my system deps are xprop and xdotool
[12:40:19] <sri19> lopid: ouch ..
[12:40:21] <lopid> if the application is simple enough, you can just provide it and give instructions on how to run it. eg. download and run this executable
[12:40:38] <sri19> it is dead simple
[12:40:59] <lopid> i rarely find that to be the case with python applications
[12:41:13] <lopid> PaulFertser, ah
[12:41:17] <jochum> sri19: you could try flatpak but i have no experience with hit
[12:41:53] <sri19> lopid: haha .. well, if you want to review code, here it is: https://gitlab.com/sri-at-gitlab/projects/xlap
[12:42:04] <sri19> it is simple enough .. ./xlap is the main executable
[12:42:21] <PaulFertser> lopid: I think I can now explain the whole chain of what happens regarding Xkb. I can not provide a way to have fully custom settings without adding to the server xkb configs though.
[12:42:24] <remyabel> doesn't look like your project has a setup.py
[12:42:35] <lopid> does it require any python modules that may not come by default with a distro?
[12:42:46] <jochum> sri19: i have a very good friend with the name sr
[12:42:49] <jochum> sri
[12:43:17] <sri19> lopid: it needs pynput and python-gobject .. which are both commonly distributes on majors OSes

[12:47:45] <lopid> PaulFertser, yeah and as we found out, one's custom config doesn't always stick around during the entire session
[12:48:32] <lopid> i can't really remember exactly what we said back then all those years ago :)
[12:48:37] <PaulFertser> lopid: for me it sticks to specific keyboard if applied "my" way and you do not use "setxkbmap" during the session.
[12:48:59] <lopid> yeah but replug that keyboard and they're gone
[12:49:00] <PaulFertser> lopid: basically, I have a laptop keyboard and I occassionally plug in a USB HID keyboard and they get different non-conflicting configs automatically.
[12:49:21] <PaulFertser> lopid: no, nothing breaks until one uses "setxkbmap" which overrides it for all keyboards.
[12:49:45] <lopid> ah right. maybe a custom udev rule…
[12:49:55] <jochum> sri19: I try to build a flatpak on top of it once you have the deps, just because you have the same first name as my good friend :)
[12:50:22] <PaulFertser> lopid: yes, custom udev rule enables per-keyboard settings all the same time.

[13:11:03] <tester24> Its history was not very nice--especially when Wikipedia admins started using it to plot their dirty little tricks. They now have bots and "permanently cloaked users/channels" running on Freenode, for "seekret operations". If it really was taken over by a "right-wing Korean businessman" with an agenda, the WMF may be forced to find other accommodation lol
[13:11:36] <tester24> On IRC a hapless nerd could control a channel by gaining sysop rights. Giving him (very few IRC users were ever female and this is still true today) the power to silence and ban opponents.
[13:12:04] <tester24> Does anyone remember what happened when I, Stierlitz, and a few other Wikipediocracy participants started a #wikipediocracy channel on Freenode in 2014? Just done as a gag. No one expected it to be used seriously. Epic little shit Snowolf took over the channel and banned everyone. Because he's a high-ranking Freenode sysop. There was a lengthy thread about Wiki IRC abuses in 2013. I recall there was also a thread about the #wpo
[13:12:04] <tester24> channel but it has "mysteriously disappeared". Hex was basically right; IRC was well on its way out as a public chat area by 2013. (Now, PRIVATE channel discussion, that's something you will NEVER see on a public forum. The dorks were embarrassed by wikipedialogs.com and other IRC capture posts so they "cracked down".)

[14:10:09] <randomuser> Well, since I didn't find anything of interest in the list after I narrowed down useful entries, I'll rather ask specific questions. How should be the current version (that is needed for soname) be determined and where should the library be installed (/usr/lib or /usr/lib64)?
[14:10:09] <randomuser> About the version, the current makefile does it through git. This doesn't work when it isn't built in a git repo (when it's built through a release archive). I really like the approach of hardcoding the version into the makefile and incrementing it every time a new version is out. But this might just complicate things.

[15:55:40] <no_gravity> The problem that services impose is greater complexity. For example in a container, no errors end up in the normal apache error log when you start is as a service.

[15:56:35] <amdj> they aren't; though you can set PHP's open_basedir variable to restrict the directories that file operations are allowed to operate in. that's something you'd have to do manually, and only affects PHP. also, unless you do it correctly, a malicious PHP script can just ini_set() a new variable, removing the restriction.
[15:56:50] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@122.172.205.112) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:57:36] <amdj> so if you have CGI scripts for example, there's no way to restrict what files/directories those can operate in. unless you do a private mount namespace, which is another feature you inherit from "service foo start"

[16:00:31] <lazysundaydreams> no_gravity maybe you should first try to solve apache logging issues in a container, and only after that try invent new way how to run apache as a service without a service..

This has the effect of removing the installed version AND installing an older version in one pass, which is a downgrade.

[17:50:01] <phogg> norgems: once you have resolved all 8 of them like this apt will agree to continue and unbreak your package state

[19:07:20] <Psi-Jack> The google search literally points directly to it.
[19:07:23] <Psi-Jack> First hit.
[19:07:38] <Psi-Jack> I see no excuses.
[19:08:07] <msiism> Well, suggesting Google for anything is questionable in the first place.
[19:08:08] <festerdam> Psi-Jack: Content personalization?
[19:08:08] <phogg> Psi-Jack: now that is helpful. If you say "a google search for these terms will return the best place to start as the top hit" then that's good.
[19:08:26] <Psi-Jack> And if you feel that's condescending, that's unusual, but, hey, I'm not going to teach a whole lesson in networking.
[19:08:28] <phogg> but just saying "ask google" in general is not, especially if the person may not know what he's looking for in the results

[19:10:37] <phogg> Psi-Jack: so you recommend, as someone experienced with docker networking, that the best place to start learning it is at the official docker "networking overview" page?

[19:10:43] <remyabel> you're ignoring the fact that google has been useless for years

[19:12:17] <phogg> Psi-Jack: google search has been getting slowly worse ever since they stopped being literal and started second guessing search terms.

[19:12:21] <festerdam> akik: ""
[19:12:39] <msiism> Human-edited web directories would be a real improvement.

[19:13:37] <remyabel> the fact that multiple disagreeing with you is evidence that search result quality is subjective, proving my original point
[19:13:38] <festerdam> akik: I think you can use quotes to guarantee that the expression appears in the results.
[19:13:46] <Psi-Jack> I've seen it correct my spelling, and that helped result in a better answer.
[19:13:47] <phogg> Psi-Jack: if you "always" "quote" "each" "term" you will generally get better results, but it's annoying enough that even I don't

[23:58:57] <zamnedix> ive been using a kinesis advantage for years, i love it. never tried the "truly" split kind with two separate pieces though
[23:58:59] <cousteau> My computer randomly decided that /tmp was a read-only file system

[23:59:07] <tgarder> I mean compared to a wavy ergonomic 1-piece keyboard

[23:59:11] <PaulFertser> tgarder: tbh, I am somehow keyboard-agnostic. I type on my netbook's keyboard atm, and I can't say I have any feelings about it. Any keyboard works.
[23:59:21] <cousteau> I guess I was only able to use my PC at all because /home is in a separate partition to the rest
[23:59:23] <[[R]]> cousteau: well nothing is random...
[23:59:31] <cousteau> Dunno what happened... anyway rebooting fixed it
[23:59:58] <cousteau> [[R]]: what about hardware faults?
