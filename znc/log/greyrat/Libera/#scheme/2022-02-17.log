[12:43:31] <dpk> next job: splitting
[12:44:15] <dpk> which i initially skipped because it looked too much like Haskell
[12:47:09] <dpk> oh. i think *this* is the part that depends on laziness
[12:48:07] <dpk> in a strict language, you can't implement getting the nth element of a tree used as a random-access sequence efficiently using split as given, because you'll also generate new finger trees containing all the elements to the left and right of that element
[12:48:54] <dpk> but still, i think my next experiment will be removing laziness completely
[12:50:43] <dpk> as with my rewrite of their views to leftmost, remove-left and rightmost, remove-right, you probably want to rewrite their Split to three procedures: left-of, right-of, and uhh maybe just call it at
[12:56:10] <dpk> assuming you don't have laziness, at least
[12:59:11] <dpk> the easiest thing to do might actually be to copy their introduction of a split datatype and make lazy constructors for it, like my make-node, though
[13:02:07] <dpk> but: i think an entirely strict implementation of finger trees would be possible
[13:02:20] <dpk> laziness, in this case, just reduces code duplication
[13:03:26] <dpk> well, reduces the code duplication needed to efficiently support getting all permutations of the left, element, and right members of their Split

[13:47:00] <amazigh> The creator of https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-134/ has a fingertree implementation, it is part of the SRFI-134 repo, but there is another implementation in their personal github
[13:48:19] <amazigh> I disregarded fingertrees, even if the generality / genericity looks appealing, the fact that complexity is good when amortized (amortized complexity) is dubious.

[21:24:40] <dpk> i think Clojure’s persistent vectors may make a better persistent deque with efficient random access  https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1
[21:24:51] <dpk> than finger trees, that is
[21:27:34] <Zipheir> What's wrong with banker's deques?
[21:29:03] <Zipheir> OK, "practically O(1)" in this post is "O(log n), but usually closer to O(1)".
[21:29:18] <Zipheir> CS professors are weeping.
[21:31:14] <Zipheir> My impression is that when someone says something is O(1) (unamortized) they're either obviously right or exaggerating.
[21:32:12] <Zipheir> Hence I hope we can stop idolizing and embrace the logarithm.
[21:35:27] <Zipheir> Generalized random-access sequences aren't well-served by deques, so I guess I'd tend toward the SRFI 101 implementation.
[21:35:56] <Zipheir> I don't know if Okasaki gave a name to that structure beyond "binary tree lists" or "random-access sequences".
[21:39:19] <Zipheir> But I would trust it over Rich Hickey's hacks.
[21:40:12] <amazigh> I did not dive a lot but apparantly immutablejs picked rich hickey algorithm from clojure and they both write O(log32(n)) even if it only makes sense for marketing reasons
[21:40:54] <amazigh> I am curious to learn how puting values only in the leaf can help the worst case
[21:41:23] <Zipheir> What is log32 ?

[21:56:37] <sham1> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our
[21:56:39] <sham1> opportunities in that critical 3%.
[21:56:41] <Zipheir> I'm wondering if we can generalize that to just "optimization".

[22:04:36] <mdhughes> And then test the hell out of it. Optimization is job last-before-shipping.

[22:05:46] <tokie> it's hard these days, especially with concurrency
[22:05:56] <sham1> gwatt: way too much. Of course we have tools that can be used to help fix it, so it's more a social problem more than anything
[22:06:14] <tokie> for years i worked at a company that sold a DNS server product for ISPs and it was the fastest DNS resolver in the world, and the things we did to make it that fast are ridiculous
[22:06:33] <tokie> but if we didn't make it as fast as it was, it wouldn't have competed in the market
[22:06:39] <Zipheir> I can imagine.
[22:07:09] <tokie> it also might have required an ISP to buy 700 servers instead of 70
[22:07:10] <Zipheir> That's the other thing; programmers spend much more time thinking about speed than they do about correctness.
[22:07:11] <mdhughes> But hopefully someone wrote it correctly and slow first.
[22:07:20] <mdhughes> But given how well DNS works, probably not.
[22:07:24] <tokie> mdhughes: no, that's not possible
[22:07:25] <gwatt> How much faster was it than competitors? 
[22:07:33] <tokie> 10-20x
[22:07:48] <tokie> competitors could maybe do 100k qps? this thing can do 2million+ on a laptop
[22:08:18] <tokie> but the "YAGNI" approach never would have built that software. it was built to be highly concurrent from the ground up
[22:08:32] <tokie> not that i'm against YAGNI - it's just sometimes hard
[22:08:41] <tokie> there's still a place for design
[22:08:46] <Zipheir> YAGNI?

[22:08:53] <tokie> "you ain't gonna need it"
[22:09:12] <tokie> this is why i like things like scheme as a hobby, or haskell, or writing schemes. it allows me to escape industry and go back to correctness
[22:10:11] <mdhughes> You do need it if you're building concurrent software. But you don't optimize or "architect" more than you need.
[22:10:36] <mdhughes> And you never code more than you can test.
[22:11:02] <mdhughes> Or, you know, the other approach is the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Methodlogy, which is what most industry uses.
[22:11:08] <Zipheir> Tests are very important, but not enough.
[22:11:49] <mdhughes> If something can't be tested, it's not real, it's religion.
[22:12:07] <Zipheir> Well, we've had this discussion many times.
[22:12:17] <Zipheir> In any case, I am in favor of tests!
[22:12:25] <mdhughes> (those tests may and should include human QA, not just machines, because machines are stupid garbage programmed by humans)

[23:37:44] <klf> Can someone give me a high-level overview how to parse syntactic forms?
[23:37:54] <klf> like a lambda, for example
[23:40:25] <klf> Here's the grammar that I've prepared. (http://codepad.org/MtabOHt2)    It's supposed to be a mini subset  of the language, of course.

[23:42:32] <Zipheir> klf: What parsing tools are you using, or are you rolling your own?
[23:42:45] <klf> PLY
[23:43:17] <klf> But the 25 minute tutorial which the TA gave was for miniJava :S
[23:43:41] <Zipheir> Is that an LALR(1) generator?
[23:43:56] <klf> I just want to know at a high level how can you write a parser that can recognize syntactical forms without the use of keywords.
[23:44:02] <klf> Zipheir, yes sir.

[23:45:57] <sham1> They're just identifiers. The fact that they're the first thing in the form makes them special
[23:46:53] <sham1> You don't need to have special handling for `class` or `return` or such with a language that uses S-expressions
[23:47:12] <sham1> You'd only have to care about them during semantic analysis

[23:49:30] <klf> kw-formals = ( "(" lambda_args ")" )
[23:49:39] <klf>            | ( "(" lambda_arg_non_empty "." ID ")" )
[23:50:11] <klf> I won't pollute the channel, it's from my grammar doc.
[23:50:32] <klf> now, how can I write a parser that recognize this syntactic form?
[23:50:39] <klf> the lambda form.
[23:51:25] <klf> I can't think of a way
[23:52:02] <sham1> Well, if you have a (lambda (a b c) (+ a b c)) let's say, you can just parse the a, b and c following the parenthesis as simply identifiers. You consume identifiers until you find the ")" token, which ends your list of formal arguments
[23:52:02] <Zipheir> klf: What do you mean?  I thought you were using a parser generator?
[23:52:29] <sham1> If you encounter ".", you can then take the token after that, parse as an identifier (and then check if your next token is ")", if not, error)
[23:52:33] <Zipheir> Sure, if you're parsing "by hand" (i.e. recursive descent).
[23:52:46] <sham1> Well that's basically the procedure with parser generators as well
[23:53:06] <Zipheir> I'm just not understanding what information klf wants.
[23:53:22] <klf> shaml is kinda getting to it
[23:53:35] <jcowan> You have to decide what "the grammar of Scheme" refers to.  If you track the various Reports, then there is primitive syntax and non-primitive syntax, and in R5 and later you can define your own syntax.
[23:54:43] <jcowan> However, the distinction between primitive and non-primitive is somewhat arbitrary.  The Reports treat if as primitive and cond as non-primitive, but obviously you can define either in terms of the other.
[23:57:23] <Zipheir> Certainly string-length isn't "primitive syntax".
[23:57:25] <klf> shaml, your suggestion relies on my parser parsing  ID "lambda" as the signal
[23:58:19] <klf> but "lambda" can be boudn to something else
[23:58:28] <klf> (Define lambda 1)
[23:59:20] <sham1> Yes
[23:59:26] <sham1> Well
[23:59:30] <sham1> It;s complicated
