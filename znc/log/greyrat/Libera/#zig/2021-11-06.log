[01:21:14] <dirkson> I don't think it's possible to make vim behave sanely when using spaces instead of tabs. Or at least, it's beyond both me and #neovim.
[01:22:27] <companion_cube> hu, weird, I've been using spaces for years
[01:22:31] <companion_cube> define "sanely"?
[01:25:42] <dirkson> I want to treat an indent level as a unit. Frankly, I don't care much whether the underlying characters are one space, one tab, 147 spaces, whatever. But I should be able to pick how wide an indent is, and I should be able to treat an indent as one 'character' for the purposes of creating, deleting, moving, etc. I can't make vim move over more than one character as if it were a single character. 
[01:26:44] <ifreund> yep, I know what you mean
[01:27:39] <dirkson> I was hoping I could just switch to handing zig single space indents - Which it seems to allow. But then I can't make vim render a single space as anything other than a single space. Which sucks for readability.

[01:39:52] <ifreund> though I can somewhat avoid it by using the commands to increase/decrease indentation instead of manually deleting/adding whitespace
[01:40:56] <ifreund> making blocks of N spaces at the start of a line a single atom when it comes to text editing would be nicer though

I believe there's an option for considering it as a single character for movement too don't know it off the top of my head.

[01:51:28] <devast8a> You want to render it as a single tab?

[01:53:21] <dirkson> I want to render it as an indent. I usually pick 2 spaces as my indent. Whether that's a tab or a space or 4 space or 127 spaces in the backend doesn't matter that much. Although using more than one character to represent this concept on-disk seems very minorly wasteful.

[02:00:49] <ifreund> dirkson: might be simplest to rig up something that replaces the indentation with tabs when your editor loads the file then converts it back to spaces on save
[02:01:22] <ifreund> and yeah I'd personally prefer if zig had went with tabs, but it's such a minor thing that I don't really care that much
[02:01:23] <dirkson> ifreund: You're not wrong. Perhaps when I am less grumpy I will do exactly this.

[04:56:28] <dirkson> flux_control: The standard way of moving the cursor (arrow or similar keys) in vim do not respect the fake tab size. And yeah, I meant rendering the leading whitespace differently than other whitespace. I'm also not aware of software that does that, though for the life of me I don't understand why.
[05:06:47] <dirkson> Like... We've *got* the concept of an 'indent' that we, as programmers, manipulate as a unit. It's whitespace before code that visually aligns related statements. So what does it matter if it's encoded as a single tab or a single space? Just render it as whatever tab size the client requests.

[05:38:51] <flux_control> dirkson: I don't understand what you're trying to do with the movement. What are you actually trying to do?
[05:39:14] <dirkson> flux_control: Press left at indent. Move left one indent level.
[05:40:05] <flux_control> Yes, but move what? The code itself, or the cursor? If all you're doing is moving the cursor, what for? Are you trying to insert something between indent levels?
[05:41:49] <flux_control> If you're trying to move code to a different indent level, what I mentioned above does exactly that.
[05:43:38] <dirkson> flux_control: The cursor. Unindenting the code works via << or just delete. Mostly I'm trying to make sure that when I inevitably press to the left/right on accident, or move up/down in a weird way, I don't end up awkwardly between indent levels. I guess I would also be happy if I just *couldn't* move the cursor inside indents. But I'm also not sure of a way to do that.
[05:44:15] <flux_control> dirkson: Just ^ to go to the start of the line after the whitespace.
[05:44:55] <flux_control> If you actually know that you're inside leading whitespace (i.e., indent) a simple 'w' will take you to the start of the code too.
[05:46:26] <flux_control> That can be scripted with a macro (i.e., j followed by ^, or something more complicated with a script function) to ensure that you never end up inside leading whitespace when moving up/down.
[05:47:33] <dirkson> flux_control: Pressing it manually sounds like an awful lot of very repetative button pressing. Though now that I've phrased it as 'keep the cursor out of the indent space', I'm kinda taken by the idea. It more or less solves the issues with dealing with spaces vs tabs, and seems like something that should be scriptable. Like you just mentioned xD
[05:49:01] <flux_control> dirkson: Indeed. That's a job for scripting. ;)
[05:49:26] <dirkson> Yeah, I like that. Good talk.

[05:54:52] <dirkson> I'm honestly not sure if I even like zig. This is the second time I got hung up while trying to deal with the (lack of) tabs while learning.
[05:57:28] <dirkson> (Which is to say I got hung up on tabs, failed to progress further, and never got deep enough to work out if I liked it or not. My sentence wasn't super clear.)
[05:59:46] <flux_control> dirkson: Old and grumpy is good. It gives you motivation to make things work the specific way you want it, since nothing actually gives you that.

[22:29:58] <Phi_is_161803398> Ah that appears to work. Long story short, I'm fairly new to Zig and would like to use Dear Imgui from Zig, using cimgui bindings. However, the compiler complains it cannot find cimgui even though I tried adding the relevant directory (which includes the header files) using `addIncludeDir`. I also looked at zig-upaya, but that doesn't even build
[22:29:58] <Phi_is_161803398> (something with usingnamespace going awry). I tried to work out what it was doing from reading the source code and integrating that into my build.zig file, but that also doesn't work. Are there any examples I could look at that would help me figure this out?
