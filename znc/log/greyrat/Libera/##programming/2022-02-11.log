[01:06:50] <phogg> the problem is that a semantic debate started without a round of "definition of terms" first. Nobody is actually disagreeing, as far as I can tell
[01:06:52] <ProfSimm> ski: it suggests COPYING
[01:07:04] <ProfSimm> ski: and second, it's not, because in value types in swift you implement cow

[01:07:37] <ProfSimm> Wait I need to quote more
[01:07:37] <ski> of course "COW" suggests copying. but i see no reason to admit the concept of COW, at the level of the language itself
[01:07:39] <ProfSimm> "In Swift, we have reference types(Classes) and value types (Structs, Tuples, enums). The value types have a copy semantic. That means if you assign a value type to a variable or pass it as a parameter to a function(unless it is an inout parameter), the underlying data of this value is going to be copied. You will have two values with the same content but, allocated in two distinct memory addresses. "

[01:08:31] <bayaz> Title: Value and Reference Types - Swift Blog 
[01:08:48] <ProfSimm> "Types in Swift fall into one of two categories: first, “value types”, where each instance keeps a unique copy of its data, usually defined as a struct, enum, or tuple."
[01:09:13] <ProfSimm> "The most basic distinguishing feature of a value type is that copying — the effect of assignment, initialization, and argument passing — creates an independent instance with its own unique copy of its data"
[01:10:03] <ski> "The value types have a copy semantic." -- this sounds exactly like an implementation concern to me. i don't see why i, as a user of a language, should be burdened with knowing whether the implementation decides to copy or not, as long as it makes no semantical difference to the behaviour in the language. (and i don't see why an implementor would want to give up that extra room for optimization)
[01:10:44] <phogg> It can make a performance difference even when there isn't a semantic difference (depending on the implementation). Ignorance of the implementation is a luxury.
[01:10:46] <tomathy> do you commit or just checkout a branch?
[01:10:47] <ProfSimm> ski: you don't understand what that means then. Value semantics have a visible and drastic effect on how your state mutates regardless of implementation
[01:11:05] <phogg> tomathy: you commit to a branch if you are making a change
[01:12:00] <flakland> sounds like forcing copies is going to waste cache
[01:12:01] <ProfSimm> ski: copy means when you have value "a" and you pass it to a function under argument "b", if you mutate "b", then "a' doesn't change. If it's an object, changing "b" changes "a'
[01:12:04] <flakland> but what do i know rite?
[01:12:09] <ski> why insist that values correspond to instances/objects, in the first place ?
[01:12:31] <ProfSimm> ski: no one insists that values correspond to objects.
[01:12:44] <ProfSimm> ski: They're two separate things. Objects have identity, values don't
[01:12:44] <ski> "Types in Swift fall into one of two categories: first, “value types”, where each instance keeps a unique copy of its data, .."
[01:13:15] <ProfSimm> ski: it doesn't say object instance. "instance" doesn't mean object automatically
[01:13:19] <ProfSimm> values also have instances.
[01:13:25] <ski> why ?
[01:13:30] <ski> for what reason ?
[01:13:33] <ProfSimm> instance means instance, like in english

[01:14:05] <ProfSimm> And like in objects, but doesn't make them objects.
[01:14:27] <ProfSimm> You know if you have an instance of a red ball, then having an instance of a green ball doesn't mean I'm saying it's red.
[01:14:28] <ski> if i'm writing math, then this `4' is equal to that other `4'. i'm not talking about different instances of the `4', unless i'm talking meta-mathematically, iow not talking about the math, but about the language i use to discuss the math
[01:14:51] <phogg> ski: values may or may not have containers, depending on what you mean by "value."
[01:15:04] <ProfSimm> ski: value types can be compared by value. But they're still have instances you compare by value.
[01:15:38] <ski> it seems a superfluous concept, to me. values can already be stored at locations. why is that not sufficient ?
[01:15:39] <ProfSimm> ski: you know like you have two ints in two registers, that's two int instances. It's how computers work
[01:15:59] <ski> yes, that's two locations, but the same value
[01:16:03] <ProfSimm> ski: one instance per one location
[01:16:09] <ski> (if it is indeed the same value)

[01:20:12] <ski> perhaps it'd be somewhat like Dissociative Identity Disorder
[01:20:26] <ski> (not that i know much of anything about what that's like)
[01:20:28] <ProfSimm> ski: I don't think we'll ever "meld brains". It's like melding two random codebases in one app
[01:20:37] <ProfSimm> But it makes for fun sci-fi
[01:21:40] <ProfSimm> my point anyway, was a variable instance is in a single location (because passing it to another location copies the instance to another instance)
[01:22:01] <ProfSimm> So every instance has a single location so technically that could be exposed to it so it could mutate itself (its location)
[01:22:08] <ProfSimm> But never mind
[01:22:46] <ski> <ProfSimm> ski: copy means when you have value "a" and you pass it to a function under argument "b", if you mutate "b", then "a' doesn't change. If it's an object, changing "b" changes "a'
[01:23:02] <ski> i'd say that both `a' and `b' are mutable objects, both containing the same value
[01:24:17] <ProfSimm> ski: you have a mathematical understanding of value, as in all memory addresses in your RAM that contain 4, that's one value. That's what the difference comes from. I think. But it's simply not practical to talk like this, because in machines, and in reality you have an instance of something and you mess with it changing parts of it.
[01:24:42] <ski> (in case both are of reference type, then both contain a value, which is a reference value indicating / pointing to / referencing a location. and obviously (assuming it's mutable) you can mutate that location, and notice that accessing it via both `a' and `b')
[01:25:10] <ProfSimm> ski: in fact one reference is the most natural state for a "thing". Multiple references is unnatural. Like I load you my phone, so now you have a copy of my phone
[01:25:21] <ProfSimm> ski: or we both have the same phone.

[01:27:18] <ProfSimm> ski: you know how strings can be interned, so no matter how many types you write "foo" in your source, they all point to a single memory location containing an immutable "foo"
[01:27:30] <ski> sure
[01:27:48] <ProfSimm> ski: if all values did that, then I think the mathematical notion of value would align with computers. Value identity would be reference identity.
[01:28:26] <flakland> how are they not aligned already?
[01:28:31] <ProfSimm> ski: but in the real world we don't know two vaues are the same until we compare them byte by byte (or whatever). So we don't know if it's the same value or two values. Hence why it's more natural to think of them as two values that may be equal, or not, and not same value or two values

[03:28:23] <jackson99> ProfSimm I'm not sure why you'd need to clutter code with #' and funcall, and have separate namespace for functions and variables, just to avoid tacking () on function calls. that's just a matter of what syntax you use for applying function to variable
[03:28:24] <beaky> but it is clutter which is why scherme is more elegant
[03:28:36] <beaky> scheme*
[03:28:46] <ProfSimm> beaky: how does scheme handle the same issue
[03:29:00] <jackson99> what is the issue?
[03:29:12] <beaky> in scheme both functions and values are treated the same 
[03:29:32] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: I'm writing a language where you call a function by naming the variable name its bound to without further syntax

[03:30:21] <ProfSimm> jackson99: ^
[03:30:39] <jackson99> how do you call a function with one argument
[03:30:49] <ProfSimm> jackson99: as usual, see print.
[03:31:05] <jackson99> and with two?
[03:31:19] <jackson99> you could go the haskell route, and use space as function application
[03:31:25] <ProfSimm> as usual again print (1, 2, 3, named: 4, etc: 5)
[03:31:42] <jackson99> print 1 2 3
[03:32:11] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: technically all functions have at most one argument, the (...) is a sequence / queue / stream of values
[03:32:40] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: some functions chain words and arguments to make DSLs like SQL:    select (a, b, c) from (foo) where (a = b)

[03:35:12] <jackson99> what do you mean by DSL? metaprogramming/macros?
[03:35:16] <ProfSimm> jackson99: my point is DSLs are easier to parse for both computer and human, when it looks like word word (arg, group) word (arg, group) word word etc.

[03:36:44] <jackson99> ok your choice. but it is rather easy to parse. just split by space, while keeping arguments in parenthesis together.   ie function1 arg1 (function2 arg1 arg)
[03:37:55] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: the problem is words and expressions. In my example above, select, "from", "where" are literal words, not resolved to variables. While in parentheses as args they're resolved to variables (depends on the function but can be)

[03:39:02] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: so now it's about print (1 + 1) (2 + 2) (3 + 3) vs print (1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3)
[03:39:28] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit hates me
[03:39:30] <ProfSimm> jackson99: 
[03:40:51] <jackson99> print 1 + 1 2 + 2 3 + 3   would pass 9 arguments to print, assuming you can pass + function like that, which probably isn't what you wanted. I find print (1 + 1) (2 + 2) (3 + 3) just as readable as print (1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3), or more readable. but it all depends what languages you are used to, and which ones you use the most
[03:41:30] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: it's readable but it's longer and less structured
[03:41:48] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: I also have named args

[03:42:36] <ProfSimm> Can you tell I like autocompletion in my IDE :P
[03:43:09] <jackson99> it is as structure, and longer. but more common function calls would be more concise, ie print 1 2 vs print(1, 2)
[03:43:13] <jackson99> structured*
[03:44:06] <ProfSimm> jackson99: that's the thing, I'm focusing heavily on eDSLs, so I'll be using that a lot. I also have no dot operator. For example it's not foo.bar.baz but foo bar baz

[04:01:03] <ProfSimm> jackson99: many massively parallel languages have the same limitation. Like Erlang
[04:01:11] <jackson99> it is a big limitation that you can't even write a basic producer thread and consumer thread, let alone something more complex
[04:01:23] <ProfSimm> You can though. It's actor-based.
[04:01:32] <ProfSimm> But actors exchange messages, not mutable objects
[04:01:44] <ProfSimm> Messages are queues and serialized.
[04:01:50] <jackson99> so callback hell?
[04:02:02] <ProfSimm> So your scenario above would cache the result on first call and then return the cache to everyone else.

[04:53:38] <flakland> caching a function return is not workable in all situations, how could you implement a function that counts how many times it's been called? you need to communicate it's not cacheable somehow

[06:59:04] <amigojapan> Hi
[06:59:30] <cuppajoe> I would be willing to learn about databases. Its not an online game, just a small side project where the data will be stored in the same directory as the game.
[06:59:56] <ProfSimm> cuppajoeman: how many users you expect top
[06:59:59] <pulse> cuppajoe, why not just use a simple custom binary format?
[06:59:59] <cuppajoe> I've heard of formats such as csv, json, etc. Would those be of any use?
[07:00:13] <pulse> sure, if you don't mind that they expose data and you want it to be human readable
[07:00:22] <ProfSimm> cuppajoe: all of them would be fine, if you grab some off the shelf component for it
[07:00:34] <cuppajoe> I think the leaderboard would just show the top 10 users and their scores.
[07:00:38] <amigojapan> cuppajoe: sure JSON is fine
[07:00:41] <pulse> the absolute most simple thing in C would be to roll your own simple binary format
[07:00:50] <oldlaptop> Yes, and they have their good points. Not very convenient to work with though, if you want to do something other than append to them. (Even that isn't necessarily very convenient with a JSON file.)
[07:01:24] <ProfSimm> cuppajoeman: if not, you can literally have a fixed size dump where, say, you dedicate 128 bytes to username, 8 bytes to score (or whatever you need) and that's it. Fixed width all the way

[07:01:59] <pulse> you can also just use a simple text file with newlines
[07:02:11] <pulse> depending on your needs
[07:02:14] <ProfSimm> Well a text file implies use of separators
[07:02:34] <ProfSimm> More complex than 10 * (128  + 8) bytes file. Everything at fixed position
[07:02:37] *** Joins: sonny (~sonny@bras-base-london1483w-grc-30-74-12-157-79.dsl.bell.ca)
[07:02:53] <oldlaptop> sqlite gets you a *very* well-documented and understood binary format that'll probably still be readable in decades, a *very* well-tested and worked-out filesystem access layer with ACID semantics, *and* a declarative language to manipulate your data.
[07:02:53] <pulse> if you just use newlines as separators then it's quite trivial
[07:03:29] <oldlaptop> and it's comparatively convenient (*extremely* convenient from your perspective) to update things in-place
[07:03:31] <KillerWasp> cuppajoe: what game?
[07:03:49] <ProfSimm> SQLite is a swiss army knife that scales (if you do it right) from simple config files to distributed databases (well, not the file itself, but in a bigger architecture)
[07:03:53] <cuppajoe> hmm, maybe a text file where each line consists of a username and a score, seperated by newlines?
[07:03:56] <ProfSimm> But maybe too much
[07:04:30] <oldlaptop> Of course, if the whole point is to learn about designing binary formats, or writing file I/O code, this would be kind of missing the point. (Naturally, databases are a fine thing to learn about too.)
[07:04:40] <cuppajoe> the game is Pong, but with two balls and the player controls both paddles. Its private on Github right now because its for a school project, but I'll make it public when the assignment is over.
[07:04:41] <KillerWasp> It is difficult to know the type of game with just a username and score.
[07:04:46] <amigojapan> Not only separators, but you may need to convert text too values, that's why JSON or a binary file are better
[07:04:48] <oldlaptop> If the point were just to have a good data file format for your game, it's a very easy decision.
[07:04:52] <pulse> personally i stick to keep it simple

[07:18:23] <InPhase> pulse: It's a super convenient and powerful tool which can get very cumbersome when you are not in compliance with its one true path.
[07:18:37] <InPhase> And with some very opaque configuration options and poor documentation.
[07:19:10] <Decker> it's a lot better to start with than to migrate to and expect the result to be exactly what your previous build system did
[07:19:13] <InPhase> But with a reasonable number of lines of text, you can make something that pretty reliably compiles on almost any system.
[07:19:49] <flakland> all i can remember about cmake is -G 'Unix Makefiles'  ... or was it -g
[07:21:12] <ProfSimm> Consider the most popular language can't build its own projects.
[07:22:07] <InPhase> What we should probably have is pmake, which uses Python to build stuff, so we can stop struggling with the opacity of CMakeLists.txt, and embrace python as a standard development tool.

[07:24:17] <InPhase> I would much rather write a small python script using some smart package-finding build-setup Python module, and use standard Python to assemble lists of source files, with standard Python for implementing special extra behaviors or custom detections needed.

[07:25:06] <ProfSimm> That should be basic stuff.
[07:25:12] <InPhase> Setting up Python on every development computer would be no harder than setting up cmake.
[07:25:35] <flakland> oh but think of the modules!
[07:25:46] <Decker> npm install node-gyp windows-build-tools - and viola a python that works
[07:28:04] <oldlaptop> InPhase: Just from trying to build software that uses them, I am... less than devastated that the existing python-based build tools (waf, scons) have failed to conquer the world.

[08:03:15] <pulse> why does --config Release not work but -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release does

[08:05:51] <Decker> pulse --config only applies to multi-configuration tools... 
[08:06:01] <pulse> right, it says here it needs ninja

[08:06:12] <Decker> also might be something the project maintainers failed to do compliantly

[11:16:48] <pyzozord> yeah could sell it at €15 price range, but people expect graphics and music at that level
[11:17:23] <pyzozord> at €1 level I can make the game look like from a vtt, at €15 level it probably needs to look more like baldurs gate

[11:28:32] <pyzozord> teut: not really, long polling is you just don't close the connection to the server. Like, you just keep downloading the website forever, and that stream is empty so you download nothing and sometimes the server will put some data on that stream
[11:28:57] <ejjfunky> dang, if you know dumb and dumber, you're old!
[11:29:04] <teut> there is Keep-Alive header

[11:32:26] <deniska> teut: well, there wasn't `fetch` in the era when long polling was used, and you probably wouldn't put polling in the interval. You'd make a request and wait for a result, after you got a result, you'd set up a new request

[11:34:40] <deniska> teut: jquery is some javascript someone else wrote, so jquery doesn't enable anything which you couldn't already achieve
[11:35:11] <teut> thats strange because that was the way for ajax

[11:35:36] <deniska> teut: sure, jquery made many things more convenient

[11:36:40] <pyzozord> ejjfunky: my game would be a solo experience
[11:36:50] <deniska> teut: before `fetch` function appeared in browsers, the API for making ajax requests was XMLHttpRequest which is a bit awkward to use

[11:37:22] <pyzozord> well "module" was a I thin a set of adventures

[11:40:01] <teut> yes the docs say that
[11:40:06] <teut> its just badly named
[11:40:31] <duuude> pyzozord: open-source base with closed-source paid stuff to feed in it is also a great idea to get free hackers

[14:59:41] <pyzozord> how does utf-8 make it byte order independent? it still runs or little/big-endian machines
[15:00:00] <Decker> it's in order

[15:00:28] <bayaz> Title: UTF-8 - Wikipedia 
[15:00:38] <pyzozord> so little-endian machines need to remember to read in the order opposite to what's natural to them?
[15:00:49] <Decker> bytes are in order
[15:00:52] <Decker> there's no order
[15:00:52] <GeDaMo> No, they would process a byte at a time
[15:01:18] <GeDaMo> Although the first byte in a code point indicates how many bytes follow
[15:01:25] <pyzozord> can you just process a single byte? I thought you can process really onle a machine word which usually is bigger than a word
[15:01:29] <Decker> abc  is alwayas abc
[15:01:45] <GeDaMo> Most machines nowadays have byte addressable memory
[15:01:48] <pyzozord> *than a byte
[15:02:07] <pyzozord> ok I get it
[15:02:14] <pyzozord> but then why not make utf-16 also just in order?
[15:02:22] <GeDaMo> Which order?
[15:02:31] <Decker> because \0a\0b\0c and a\0b\0c\0  are both valid

[15:02:39] <pyzozord> the same order as utf-8
[15:03:06] <GeDaMo> The problem is that UTF-16 codepoints are 16 bits long, not two 8 bit values
[15:03:43] <pyzozord> oh I see
[15:04:00] <GeDaMo> If you load a single 8 bit value from a UTF-16 codepoint, you don't know if that's the high or low byte
[15:04:11] <pyzozord> endianess only matters for values larger than single byte
[15:04:20] <pyzozord> that makes sense, since it's about byte order
[15:04:27] <GeDaMo> But with UTF_8 loading a single byte tells you how many bytes the cone point consists of
[15:04:36] <GeDaMo> s/cone/code/
[15:05:17] <pyzozord> yes, I was confused about what endinaness does really, but I get it now, its about /values/ that are wider than one byte
[15:05:23] <GeDaMo> Yes
[15:05:37] <pyzozord> if two separate one-byte values are next to each other, endinaness doesn't matter. I thought it did

[18:11:20] <wovixo> Maybe the reluctance to expand on or develop new Java tools/frameworks/etc is because everyone's expecting that Oracle is going to do something evil with the licensing.
[18:11:28] <ejjfunky> Sqaure: 'user' here are developers right?
[18:11:46] <Sqaure> ejjfunky, yeah exactly. 
[18:11:53] <oldlaptop> ejjfunky: Looking at ASF's projects is kind of deceptive if you want to compare Java's "popularity" to other languages, because ASF does an unusual amount of Java stuff, to the point of maintaining many of the most important Java development and build tools.
[18:12:04] <ejjfunky> but there's the openjdk that keeps it 'open source'
[18:12:19] <Sqaure> So much about java is broken i feel theres nothing out of the ordinary comming out of it.
[18:12:22] <oldlaptop> (I concur with Square that maven should be considered harmful, but it's nothing if not an important Java build tool)
[18:12:30] <ejjfunky> the several times i had to install java, i've chosen openjdk
[18:13:09] <oldlaptop> wovixo: Oracle are already about as evil as they reasonably can be
[18:13:52] <wovixo> oldlaptop: Agreed. And dumb. Why they don't charge for a great product like VirtualBox is beyond me. I'd pay a (reasonable) fee for it, gladly.
[18:13:59] <oldlaptop> it's (I don't think) legally feasible for them to close openjdk down, although perhaps they could close down future revisions (I don't know offhand if they even hold enough of the copyrights to manage that)
[18:14:24] <oldlaptop> but they absolutely can, and do, make it a monumental pain to get "official" binaries
[18:14:38] <deniska> I think they even toned down the terms on oracle jvm distribution once they saw that everyone is forking openjdk

[18:34:15] <ejjfunky> adderall, are you on windows or linux or what os?
[18:34:17] <oldlaptop> One dirty approach (if these are unix/linux shell scripts, and we're talking about shell commands) could be to have the "main command" just use its first argument as the name of a command it should run.

[18:36:21] <oldlaptop> in fact, in POSIX sh, it could be as stupid as the single line `$@`

[22:44:11] <apotheon> what
[22:45:01] <Guest13> to blow air into their lungs
[22:45:05] <nomagno> apotheon: Someone who got banned on multiple IRC networks for being a trouble maker (THIS YEAR. Possibly this very month) is taking advantage of Matrix being harder to moderate (and having an invite mechanism) to forcefully invite everyone to a room that links to a fairly (well as menacing as DDoS can be) menacing watchlist/threat-list directed to IRC networks and operators.
[22:45:13] <nomagno> It's hypocrisy personified
[22:45:42] <nomagno> ("Forcefully invite". I clicked yes. Worth it, funny bullshit appreciated)
[22:47:16] <nomagno> Like... It looks like to me like the invited went to everyone who this guy could physically index without crashing his server

[22:50:05] <ski> channels can be set to invite-only. then you need an invite (or an exemption) to be able to join
[22:50:10] <Rounin> Hm... Come to think of it, though, a server can send you a message for a channel you're not in... But what a client decides to do with it might vary
[22:50:21] <Rounin> It might pop up a tab, might show it in the server tab, might ignore it, etc.

[23:56:41] <deniska> I guess source engine games were win-only, and I did play them through wine until they got native releases

[23:57:05] <deniska> But back then I had a laptop with a dGPU
[23:58:03] <deniska> ati mobility radeon hd2400 or something like this in toshiba from like 2008 LD
[23:58:06] <deniska> :D
[23:58:13] <user51> also re: emulation, why even play the games when you can play whackamole with emudev? :P

[23:59:10] <deniska> wine, technically speaking, is not an emulator
[23:59:20] <user51> i wonder if gameboy or nes has a more developed emu scene

[23:59:47] <deniska> gameboy certainly seems more popular as "hello world" of emulation, so maybe it's a bit simpler?
