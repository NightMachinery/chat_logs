[06:10:42] <^[> Is there a name that's conventionally reserved for unused variables?
[06:13:58] <^[> On a related note, is there a better way to loop a fixed number of times than dotimes, if I don't need the iteration variable?

[07:19:33] <White_Flame> (declare (ignore ...)) obviously, but I don't think there's anything conventional for the name itself.  I've seen ign and various prefixes, as well as _

[07:28:03] <aeth> _ is a good name for ignored, ignorable, or getting its name from somewhere else in a macro
[07:28:17] <aeth> (well, the first one or the last two)
[07:28:44] <aeth> s/ignored, ignorable, or/ignored; or, ignorable and/
[07:29:53] <^[> Thanks!
[07:30:28] <^[> Is ignorable for when you don't know how things will expand, so you may or may not end up using a binding?
[07:30:48] <aeth> yes, it greatly simplifies macro writing
[07:31:25] <aeth> you can also generate a low-level implicit variable (instead of gensym) as an ignorable, perhaps for debugging
[07:32:04] <aeth> I've used it sometimes outside of macros when I'm in the process of rewriting a function, too.
[07:33:48] <aeth> ^[: The most common ignorable would probably be if you are using with-accessors. (with-accessors bindings accessed-object ...)
[07:34:58] <aeth> Technically, the way the with-accessors macro (or a similar symbol-macrolet) works, the only time accessed-object shows up in the body is if one of the bindings is used.
[07:35:05] <beach> Good morning everyone! 
[07:35:42] <beach> ^[: (loop repeat n do ...)
[07:39:20] <^[> Looks like I don't need to (declare (ignore _)) in (dotimes (_ 10) ...) because it *is* used in the expansion.
[07:40:51] <beach> OK

[07:41:52] <beach> If you have a fear of loop, it is definitely irrational. 
[07:46:05] <^[> It feels like an overly heavy solution most of the time, and the syntax is funny and irregular, and lots of people seem to dislike it.
[07:47:36] <beach> When my students used the word "heavy" about some construct, I asked them about its weight. 
[07:48:56] <beach> I guess, then Common Lisp in its entirety is "heavy". 
[07:49:29] <beach> The syntax of Common Lisp is funny and irregular, and lots of people seem to dislike it.
[07:50:57] <beach> I personally find it amusing to see what kind of excuses people come up with to avoid learning about certain things.
[08:04:30] <White_Flame> I've gotten better at LOOP, it's raw DO that I find the most obtuse and would rather use tail recursion
[08:04:55] <aeth> DO's actually nice when it's zero-body
[08:05:03] <aeth> (i.e. purely iteration, no setting)
[08:05:07] <White_Flame> ah, I could see that
[08:05:36] <aeth> iirc, the only confusing thing is that the termination case is the opposite of what you expect?
[08:06:04] <aeth> it's an until iteration, not a while iteration
[08:06:16] <aeth> usually you think while is the normal thing
[08:06:31] <White_Flame> and the syntax takes a ton of getting used to, which I haven't
