[07:30:02] <kulak> I am on ArchLinux and I would like to add lines to my machine user ids instead of editing each ~/.zshrc file.  It seems that /etc/zsh/zshrc is so big it might've been installed by a package and it does not seem to be the right file to modify.
[07:30:38] <phy1729> what does  add lines to my machine user ids  mean?
[07:31:18] <llua> and are you not able to see what package own /etc/zsh/zshrc?
[07:31:22] <kulak> I want to add `. /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` `~/.shrc`, but I'd rather add it at system level.
[07:32:20] <kulak> file is owned by package:  extra/grml-zsh-config
[07:32:24] <phy1729> Your other users may not want that plugin
[07:33:08] <kulak> it is all me and I don't want to maintain the same lines across files
[07:33:26] <phy1729> you use multiple accounts?
[07:34:07] <kulak> root, my user id and some potentially a few when isolating applications
[07:34:36] <phy1729> I really wouldn't run zsh plugins as root
[07:34:53] <kulak> hmm
[07:35:02] <Mikachu> doesn't really matter at that point, as soon as they enter the root password they would die anyway
[07:35:30] <kulak> Mikachu, what do you mean?
[07:35:31] <Mikachu> unless you are more worried about funny accidents than actual attacks
[07:35:51] <Mikachu> i mean if someone exploits you, and you regularly enter your root account, it doesn't matter which level they initially get access to
[07:36:31] <Mikachu> and presumably you can trust the system packaged version of z-sy-h anyway
[07:36:32] <phy1729> I suppose that's true, I could add aliases/functions for sudo/doas/pkexec to slurp things.
[07:36:45] <llua> see if grml-zsh-config lets you add code to it without modifying the global zshrc since it has control over it
[07:44:21] <kulak> It turns out all I had to do is create "/etc/zsh/zshrc.local"

[22:07:41] <Mikachu> weird
[22:07:53] <Mikachu> (pressing the second key before the sleep times out in all cases)
[22:08:07] <Mikachu> though it also in no cases consumes the input, but it at least times out correctly
[22:09:01] <Mikachu> does it act the same for you?
[22:14:20] <andyandybobandy> mashing just left: hangs; esc left: hangs; a a: times out, exits 1, REPLY=n; esc esc: hangs
[22:14:41] <andyandybobandy> that's testing: read -q; sleep 1; read -t 1
