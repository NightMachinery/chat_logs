[01:11:10] <NoobAgain> So to describe TWO vectors, you need a Tensor of Rank Two, and the individual terms describe how each component 1-N of those vectors vary with each other....?
[01:11:28] <NoobAgain> It would be a square matric, N*N
[01:16:07] <johnkeats6> Z-module, rank (n, m) means it's a multilinear map (V^*)^n x V^m --> base field
[01:16:38] <johnkeats6> so a vector is rank (1, 0) since you can think of a vector as a co-covector
[01:16:56] <johnkeats6> and a covector is rank (0,1)
[01:18:21] <Z-module> don't they call that signature (n, m) ?
[01:18:32] <Z-module> I guess people differ on that
[01:18:36] <johnkeats6> no, i've never heard signature being used in that sense at all
[01:18:37] <Z-module> (like in most of math)
[01:18:51] <johnkeats6> signature refers to bilinear forms for me

[01:19:02] <johnkeats6> how many positive and how many negative eigenvalues
[01:21:22] <johnkeats6> NoobAgain, no. to describe two vectors, you just have two vectors
[01:22:28] <NoobAgain> Say one vector varies with another one, and you want to describe how they do that
[01:22:58] <NoobAgain> Or they work together in some way
[01:23:08] <NoobAgain> Isn't that then a Tensor of higher rank?
[01:23:27] <NoobAgain> Like the example of 'stress' in a substance
[01:23:43] <johnkeats6> it's hard to tell because you're being very vague. if you say one vector varies with another one i'd think more of a function relating them

[01:25:14] <johnkeats6> i think an intuitive way to think about a rank (n, 0) tensor is some quantity for which you need to specify n directions to know its value. e.g. think of the energy-momentum tensor. it tells you the flow of i-momentum in the j direction
[01:25:33] <johnkeats6> sorry i guess that's rather rank (0, n)

[03:17:11] <dfcnvt> Will this ever be true?  Given n is odd number, 3n+1 = m, m resulted as an odd number.
[03:17:39] <dfcnvt> It seem to always be Even number...? Is that the case?  Will it ever arrive to the point it's an odd number?
[03:17:55] <buster> try n=2
[03:18:08] <dfcnvt> No, n has to be odd number, fyi.
[03:18:22] <dfcnvt> Let me revise my statement.
[03:18:46] <int-e> dfcnvt: you're multiplying and odd number (3) by another odd number (n), and then you add an odd number to the result...
[03:18:47] <dfcnvt> Given n is odd number,  3n+1=m,  m is always even number.
[03:18:55] <Capso> dfcnvt: every odd number can be written n = 2j+ 1 for j an integer. apply this
[03:19:26] <buster> dfcnvt, first time was fine. sorry I misread.
[03:20:39] <dfcnvt> n=9...m=19   Seems to dispute it?
[03:20:47] <dfcnvt> Doh, nevermind
[03:21:08] <cherim> Yes, with fixed last element you can divide by N
[03:21:09] <dfcnvt> it's m=28
[03:21:34] <cherim> By symmetry, contributions of string with last element = 1,2,... N are all equal
[03:22:25] <Capso> cherim: ok, I was going astray by trying to subtract 1 from everything instead
[03:22:32] <buster> dfcnvt, as Capso said, let n=2j+1; then m=3(2j+1)+1=6j+4=2(3j+2) is even.
[03:23:18] <cherim> People working on the Collatz conjecture would panic otherwise
[03:24:00] <Capso> cherim: and in that case, for the double sequence count we get S(M,k1) k1! S(M,k2) k2! multinom(N, ...)/N^2

[03:39:22] <dfcnvt> I can add the fourth rule for skipping any resulting number that has a remaining number.
[03:39:33] <Capso> cherim: so if I go back to how we arrive at the count with all elements free, then try to correct each factor for when it's fixed, then I get an N^(-2) factor from each of S(M,k1) k1! S(M,k2) k2! -> S(M,k1) k1! S(M,k2) k2!/N^2

[03:55:43] <Capso> cherim: So the contribution of partitions becomes S(M-1,k1-1) (k1 - 1)! S(M-1, k2-1) (k2 - 1)! ... is that bit right?
[03:57:38] <cherim> That would be the case if the last element was necessarily unique in its string
[03:58:05] <cherim> Then M-1 positions would have been partitioned into k1-1 sets
[03:58:10] <Capso> ok so if it wasn't one of [1,N]
[03:58:44] <cherim> Yes
[03:59:18] <cherim> In strings like (2,1,3,1) with the last fixed to 1 there are still 3 parts in M-1 positions
[03:59:29] <Capso> huh I thought this was going to be a trivial modification
[03:59:47] <cherim> You can still write an explicit formula of the same form
[03:59:55] <cherim> Just do everything carefully

[04:07:59] <cherim> Suppose we couldn't guess the symmetry 1/N argument and solved the case of one string generically

[04:09:23] <cherim> You can check that this is indeed S(M, k)k! binom(N, k)/N using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind#Recurrence_relation

[04:19:56] <cherim> I don't see any induction here

[04:20:47] <tusko> shouldn't there also be a root of 1 for x^{r-1}
[04:21:10] <tusko> Instead, I'm told, the roots are 0 with multiplicity 2
[04:21:19] <Capso> cherim: ok, rather: by holding all bit the first element equal to j, then all but the first two, etc. and the free elements are never allowed to be equal to j
[04:21:38] <Capso> and then summing up
[04:22:29] <cherim> I suggest you first fix the sets of labels for the two strings
[04:22:48] <cherim> Like what the multinomial did in the original formulation
[04:23:06] <Capso> all the entries are coming from [1,N]

[04:23:36] <cherim> There is only a finite number of terms in the answer, no summations of length M or N or k
[04:24:04] <cherim> It should actually be pretty close to fixing one element of N to be in that x=k-k1-k2
[04:24:26] <cherim> Also, set up some brute force table for checking what you get

[18:00:45] <rubiksdream> im wondering, if X and Y are topological spaces with universal covers U,V, and some function f : X -> Y lifts to a map g : U -> V (i.e. if p,q are the covering maps for X and Y then q o g = f o p ), and g is continuous, does that necessarily mean f is continuous too?
[18:02:13] <rubiksdream> hmm, I guess we could restrict p to some set U where its a homeomorphism, which would show that on p(U), f is continuous, and clearly sets like p(U) cover X
[18:02:50] *** Joins: zibby15 (~androirc@user/zibby15)
