[05:43:49] <cryptic1> running linux without installing it is illegal
[05:43:54] <SpookyGibby> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, Windows Subsystem for Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, WSL. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free app in the Microsoft Store and part of a fully functioning Windows system made useful by the Windows OS, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. 
[05:43:54] <SpookyGibby> Many computer users run a modified version of the WSL system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of WSL which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Windows system, developed by Microsoft. 
[05:43:54] <SpookyGibby> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the app: the program in the system that wastes the machine's resources to limit the other programs that you run. The app is an optional part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete Windows operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Windows 
[05:43:55] <SpookyGibby> operating system: the whole system is basically Windows with Linux added, or WSL. All the so-called "Linux" apps are really flavors of WSL.

[05:46:03] <a1> No, Richard, it's 'Linux', not 'GNU/Linux'. The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation.
[05:46:03] <a1> Following are some reasons for you to mull over, including some already answered in your FAQ.
[05:46:07] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> not running Linux is EXPENSIVE
[05:46:09] <csws> lol
[05:46:10] <a1> One guy, Linus Torvalds, used GCC to make his operating system (yes, Linux is an OS -- more on this later). He named it 'Linux' with a little help from his friends. Why doesn't he call it GNU/Linux? Because he wrote it, with more help from his friends, not you. You named your stuff, I named my stuff -- including the software I wrote using GCC -- and Linus named his stuff. The proper name
[05:46:10] <a1> is Linux because Linus Torvalds says so. Linus has spoken. Accept his authority. To do otherwise is to become a nag. You don't want to be known as a nag, do you?
[05:46:13] <csws> syadmin have you seen HBCD PE
[05:46:13] <a1> (An operating system) != (a distribution). Linux is an operating system. By my definition, an operating system is that software which provides and limits access to hardware resources on a computer. That definition applies whereever you see Linux in use. However, Linux is usually distributed with a collection of utilities and applications to make it easily configurable as a desktop system,
[05:46:14] <a1> a server, a development box, or a graphics workstation, or whatever the user needs. In such a configuration, we have a Linux (based) distribution. Therein lies your strongest argument for the unwieldy title 'GNU/Linux' (when said bundled software is largely from the FSF). Go bug the distribution makers on that one. Take your beef to Red Hat, Mandrake, and Slackware. At least there you have
[05:46:14] <a1> an argument. Linux alone is an operating system that can be used in various applications without any GNU software whatsoever. Embedded applications come to mind as an obvious example.

[12:46:18] <xe0n> you should be able to fix most things remote, if theres a hardware failure, monitoring should tell you that. then depending on the urgency, you then make the call whether you need to go in (if it can be fixed in that session), or you schedule it. i.e. if a server has died, chances are it needs a part replaced, so you'll need to organise the part before hand...no use going in if you 
[12:46:18] <xe0n> cant do anything

[13:15:56] <sd> 13<C​olour> Preferably there is a link to documentation on the prerequisites
[13:16:02] <BWMerlin> I do step by steps with arrows but I need to learn how to document settings
[13:16:03] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> Asking the right questions is insanely important too is something I've found
[13:16:24] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> I need to start doing this honestly
[13:16:38] <BWMerlin> Like I will document how to install a programme, but I need to develop a style of how to document the settings once it is installed
[13:16:43] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> I do coding as well and sometimes I come back to my old code to which I thought "yeah future me will understand this, easy"
[13:16:52] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> Came back to it later like "oh god what is this"
[13:17:01] <sd> 13<C​olour> It depends on if it's easy and short or long
[13:17:43] <sd> 13<C​olour> Just make it as easy and painless as possible
[13:18:01] <xe0n> arrows are baddd....use squares to highlight things... green = good, yellow = warning, red = bad\focus
[13:18:12] <sd> 13<C​olour> Leaving things out and assuming beyond basics will backfire
[13:18:16] <xe0n> and yes you'd write documentation on how to access documentation if thats the situation
[13:18:29] <xe0n> installing = technical documentation
[13:18:37] <xe0n> you should also have a design documentation
[13:18:39] <xe0n> and then operational
[13:19:07] <xe0n> can all be in the same folder, but have clear separation so it doesnt take forever to find something

[17:37:33] <vinrock> yeah im not sure when they got rid of the double decker tacos 
[17:37:40] <vinrock> i had like a 10 year gap 
[17:37:45] <JollyRgrs> bloody: oh, i do, too... place near my office had great taco tuesday deals... a lot of us in the office went every tuesday

[20:14:54] <Hunterkll> wut
[20:14:58] <pcspkr> yea
[20:15:03] <Hunterkll> i don't think i've ever had a premier case that didn't involve a shitload of powershell
[20:15:20] <pcspkr> a com api doesn't work in server 2022 so I opened a ticket, they just wanna close it because "they are not trained"
[20:15:27] <pcspkr> even complained to our account manager lol
[20:15:45] <pcspkr> and you pay for that shit too
[20:15:59] <pcspkr> microsoft must not give a shit when they makin bank with azure

[20:16:30] <Hunterkll> that's the opposite of my experiences
[20:16:44] <csws> my experience with support is pretty awful universally
[20:16:50] <Hunterkll> but lol that should just go to a new agent then 
[20:16:51] <csws> but if you could find people in real life things got a lot better
[20:17:02] <Hunterkll> yea premier is pretty good
[20:17:10] <csws> like we had one of these dudes come out as some cloud evangelist and I got to talk about some graph API issues with him
[20:17:10] <Hunterkll> though i've heard mixed reviews about the unified support shit
[20:17:21] <Hunterkll> but premier is pretty much punch to tier 3 immediately 
[20:17:27] <pcspkr> I mean suse support patched 3rd party makefiles and submitted the patch upstream to github for me
[20:17:34] <csws> unified is just "every day is sev A day"
[20:17:35] <csws> lol
[20:17:42] <csws> it's the only way to get an engineer
[20:17:54] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: and microsoft's done in-ram patching of running executables for me and delivered hotfixes rapidly for pro support tickets
[20:17:57] <Hunterkll> point? 
[20:18:01] <Hunterkll> every support has shit engineers somewhere
[20:18:10] <Hunterkll> just call up the premier number and ask the ticket person to route it to a new engineer
[20:18:10] <pcspkr> location: india
[20:18:35] <csws> MS may have one good engineer for every 1000 "engineers" in india
[20:18:40] <Hunterkll> eh

[20:20:30] <csws> man pcspkr I was dealing with the protection centre role scopes. like it has a pretty cool feature where you can scope a role so the person can only ediscovery a certain department, for instance

[20:20:47] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: i mean, that might be the wrong team for whatever reason 
[20:20:50] <csws> the issue is they have to do something on onedrive to make it work
[20:20:54] <Hunterkll> that it got routed to
[20:21:16] <csws> in the end I never got it done.. I'd send them docs, they'd ignore it, they'd pretend I'm talking about something else.. I'd demonstrate the feature in front of them, "ok I'll talk to the senior" and then next time it's like they got mind wiped

[20:27:40] <Hunterkll> If you want to remove the LCU
[20:27:40] <Hunterkll> To remove the LCU after installing the combined SSU and LCU package, use the DISM/Remove-Package command line option with the LCU package name as the argument. You can find the package name by using this command: DISM /online /get-packages.
[20:27:40] <Hunterkll> Running Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe) with the /uninstall switch on the combined package will not work because the combined package contains the SSU. You cannot remove the SSU from the system after installation.

[21:10:51] <dragonfleas> or are they SUPER redundant
[21:10:54] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: theyre fucking deep as shit
[21:11:01] <Hunterkll> and they do occasionally need to be dragged up for repairs
[21:11:05] <mistiry> and they have been damaged before
[21:11:09] <Hunterkll> but MAREA is 8 fiber pairs 
[21:11:14] <thegodsquirrel> Ships can fuck them up with their anchors I hear
[21:11:17] <Hunterkll> 26.2terabit per fiber pair 
[21:11:36] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: so i'd say the fastest is 26.2 terabits thereotically for a single fiber optic pair cable
[21:11:39] <dragonfleas> how do they detect where the damage is? do they have like cameras along the line or like repeater nodes that alert if there's degradation?

[22:12:44] <sintax> we will teach you when you uninstall discord

[22:12:57] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> otherwise shit's basic still
[22:12:58] <catbeard> account-tag and away-notify is neat
[22:13:20] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i like the idea of message tagging so you can, I guess, create block messages
[22:13:37] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> if I'm understanding it correctly
[22:13:45] <catbeard> moreso so that you can recognize messages by nickserv account rather than just nick
[22:13:53] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> ah
[22:14:05] <catbeard> e.g. sopel's bot.trigger.account
[22:14:06] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> but it should at least aid in ascii art, right?
[22:14:11] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> lel
[22:14:21] <catbeard> no, for that you need "fakelag"
[22:14:28] <catbeard> and of course the scripts to ansify stuff

[22:15:18] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> but if you tag the art, couldn't v3 compat clients combine the lines into a single block?
