[00:16:24] <knbk> LuxuryMode: yes, somewhere between "marginally" and "a lot". It's probably not worth optimizing unless you have some huge fields in your model

[02:05:19] <timdiels> _post_clean only sets MyForm.Meta.fields on the instance, doesn't touch other instance attrs, hence setting those in clean() should be ok (and the rest I can simply modify in cleaned_data). Alternatively I could override Model.clean_fields(excluded) to skip the validation of excluded fields, but then those fields won't be validated by the time I call form.save().

[07:46:32] <Batzy> nvm i had to stick an __init__.py in my migrations folder
[07:47:03] <Batzy> now it just wont let me migrate at all
[07:47:40] <FunkyBob> if you manually created the migrations folder, explicitly telling migrations the app to make migrations for can help
[07:48:30] <Batzy> Your models have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied.
[07:48:30] <Batzy>   Run 'manage.py makemigrations' to make new migrations, and then re-run 'manage.py migrate' to apply them.
[07:48:39] <Batzy> literally 2 seconds after i ran "makemigrations"
[07:48:41] <Batzy> i have no idea what to do
[07:48:55] <FunkyBob> if you want our help, you'll need to provide more details
[07:49:09] <FunkyBob> like a dpaste of the full output of the makemigrations and migrations commands
[07:49:12] <Batzy> i dont have any besides it's django and postgressql inside docker-compose

[07:50:42] <Batzy> does the paste not answer the question?
[07:50:51] <Batzy> i think that is a one-off command?

[07:50:54] <FunkyBob> yes
[07:50:56] <FunkyBob> that explains it

[07:52:01] <Batzy> it is
[07:52:27] <FunkyBob> so after the first command you see the new migrations in your local code tree?
[07:52:46] <Batzy> no
[07:52:55] <FunkyBob> I note 'api' is not listed in the 'migrate' app list
[07:53:20] <FunkyBob> why can't you run makemigrations locally/ why must it be within the container?
[07:53:43] <FunkyBob> because you're keeping all the env isolated in the container/
[07:53:44] <FunkyBob> ?
[07:53:48] <Batzy> yes
[07:54:04] <Batzy> although i would like it to persist the data to the host
[07:54:45] <FunkyBob> the data, or the migration?
[07:54:51] <Batzy> both
[07:55:04] <Batzy> i gave the db a volume too, it looks like its not being used
[07:56:05] <FunkyBob> well, the DB must be stored somewhere... migrate is seeing that migrations have been applied
[07:57:29] <Batzy> no it isnt
[07:57:51] <Batzy> it's saying the models have changes that arent reflected in migration, ie, it doesnt see anything from `makemigrations`
[07:58:12] <Batzy> I think you're right though that the files are just being discarded
[07:58:39] <FunkyBob> yes, but migrate is saying there are no migrations to apply from the other installed apps...
[07:59:13] <FunkyBob> admin, auth, contenttypes, and sessions ship with their own migrations
[07:59:26] <FunkyBob> it's only the migration for your new code that's not showing
[07:59:51] <FunkyBob> am curious if it behaves any different if you explicitly tell makemigrations to make for api ?

[08:15:46] <FunkyBob> what do the ownership and perms look like from inside the container?
[08:15:55] <FunkyBob> it can make the file in there, clearly... since it applied the migration
[08:19:17] <Batzy> im not really sure how to check, i dont have bash avail
[08:19:29] <FunkyBob> docker exec ...  bash
[08:19:36] <FunkyBob> or /bin/sh

[08:24:03] <FunkyBob> yah, most people seem to skip running their containers as other than root, for some reason
[08:24:22] <Batzy> i dont run it at root? wdym
[08:24:44] <FunkyBob> so you specify a different user for the container to run as?
[08:24:51] <FunkyBob> in your Dockerfile?
[08:25:01] <Batzy> oh no i see what you mean
[08:25:07] <Batzy> no i meant im not running docker in the host as root
[08:25:19] <FunkyBob> you may not be root, but the container is by default
[08:25:22] <bparker> what's the difference
[08:25:27] <bparker> container is container
[08:25:30] <bparker> why does the user matter

[08:37:36] <bparker> also when you do compose down (instead of stop), it will erase everything

[14:16:04] <mad_moses> moldy: I just need to run django.setup() and thats it?
[14:16:22] <moldy> mad_moses: not quite, you have to do some more stuff, it's about 5 lines of code or such
[14:16:37] <mad_moses> moldy: is this documented somewhere or do you have an examle?
[14:16:44] <moldy> iirc you have set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE, call settings.configure() and django.setup()... something like that

[21:24:49] <Croves> Hello folks! What's the "smartest" way to have authentication by phone OR email? I need to have both fields in my custom User model right? And both should be unique? How that's suposed to work?!
[21:26:13] <GinFuyou> You add both fields to model, and make them unique=True =)

[21:29:34] <Croves> GinFuyou What should be the USERNAME_FIELD in this case? The requirement is at least one must be mandatory
[21:29:44] <Croves> So I can have an e-mail, or a phone, or both
[21:30:25] *** Joins: brylie (~Thunderbi@88-114-218-113.elisa-laajakaista.fi)
[21:30:30] <GinFuyou> Both probably? It's been a while since I built a custom authorization

[21:33:46] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:34:23] <GinFuyou> maybe not a whole backend... You just try authorize with email first, then with phone if first fails
