[11:40:39] <ordex> fling: not sure you can. on android i think you can have one vpn enabled at a time
[11:40:45] <ordex> but plaisthos may know the real answer
[11:42:37] <fling> I've been told a vpn app could do multiple tunnels
[11:44:04] <ordex> ah
[11:44:09] <ordex> maybe I am wrong then

[12:30:42] <bigtony2> i have an issue hope someone can help with. i have openvpn setup on my synology nas and i also have pihole runing as dns server.  how do i get openvpn to use pilhole dns ? i tried push "dhcp-option DNS myip" and it breaks the dns lookup when i connect to the vpn
[12:32:06] <ordex> bigtony2: is 'myip' the local IP of the pihole ?
[12:32:41] <bigtony2> its the 192.168 address to the nas that pihole runs on
[12:32:55] <bigtony2> i run it on port 8585 if that makes a difference
[12:33:17] <ordex> what is 'it' ? openvpn?
[12:34:01] <bigtony2> ? i don't understand your question 
[12:34:49] <bigtony2> in the openvpn.conf file i have push "dhcp-option DNS 192.168.100.191"
[12:35:42] <ordex> ok
[12:35:59] <bigtony2> thanks for your help by the way
[12:36:01] <ordex> are you routing all your traffic via the VPN?
[12:36:21] <ordex> (i.e. does the client send traffic for 192.168.100.191 to the VPN?) 
[12:36:55] <bigtony2> yes it does i use openvpnconect and i'm able to conect to the vpn
[12:37:17] <bigtony2> however i conect using my domain name
[12:38:04] <ordex> yeah
[12:38:13] <ordex> that's ok
[12:38:37] <ordex> I presume you are routing to your LAN and not NAT'ing
[12:38:48] <ordex> therfore, does the pihole know how to send packets back to your VPN address?
[12:39:14] <bigtony2> i'm not sure i'm new at this :(
[12:39:30] <ordex> well, this is more about networking, than openvpn
[12:39:48] <ordex> when you connect two networks, hosts in both networks need to know how to send packets back and forth
[12:39:51] <bigtony2> i setup port forwarding on 1194 if that makes sense
[12:40:55] <ordex> that's to connect to the VPN
[12:40:58] <ordex> but once you are connected
[12:41:03] <ordex> you basically have the VPN network on one side
[12:41:10] <ordex> and your 192.168.100.0/24 on the other
[12:41:22] <ordex> a VPN client will send all traffic to your server
[12:41:33] <ordex> your server knows how to reach .119 and will send traffic there
[12:41:39] <ordex> then, does .119 know how to send traffic back?
[12:42:22] <bigtony2> how do i determine that ? and if its outside the scope of here then i uderstand was just trying to get some help 
[12:42:51] <ordex> bigtony2: well, the pihole should have a route to the VPN network
[12:43:05] <ordex> otherwise it will just send the traffic to the default gateway
[12:43:23] <bigtony2> thats where my issue is i don't know how to make it route to the vpn network 
[12:43:51] <ordex> get on the pihole and add a route
[12:44:14] <ordex> this is unrelated to openvpn - you just have to add a route
[12:44:31] <bigtony2> oh ok hang on ill try 
[12:47:48] <Pippin_> synology automagically adds a ip_forward=1 and masquerade rule (not visible in firewall)
[12:48:00] <Pippin_> no need to do something, it should work
[12:48:21] <Pippin_> unless docker is involved.....
[12:48:53] <bigtony2> yes i'm runing pihole in a docker container
[12:49:03] <ordex> there you go :)
[12:50:04] <bigtony2> so it will not work inside a docker?
[12:50:50] * Pippin_ knows 0 about how to configure docker net...
[12:53:00] <bigtony2> ok thanks for pointing me in the right direction

[21:28:08] <colo> well for what it's worth, they started writing a "container runtime" in a language with m:n threading. so there's AT LEAST that to take into account...
