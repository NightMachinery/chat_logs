[03:46:38] <slaughter> Well it was to send a semi-snarky semi-aggressive fully-detailed support request in to a vendor
[03:46:40] <slaughter> So there's that

[04:22:52] <slaughter> Oh damn they gave me a canned keyword-driven response to a multi-paragraph support question. Semi -> fully
[04:23:58] <rawtaz> i see where you got your nick from
[04:24:50] <slaughter> Ha!
[04:28:06] <lantech19446> i fucking hate that

[04:37:05] <lantech19446> I can deal with snarky / aggressive I work with the public and i'm married
[04:37:20] <lantech19446> I wouldn't do that to you though after how many times you've helped me

[04:48:32] <Dus10> I get to create our DevOps curriculum at school!
[04:48:36] <rawtaz> we should `finger` more.. it's been a long time since i did that :(
[04:48:46] <Dus10> and since I have already created it for my minions at work, bonus!
[04:48:56] <rawtaz> but i did `write` with someone just a couple of weeks ago :D

[04:49:15] <Dus10> I love getting paid for two jobs doing the work once
[04:49:21] <rawtaz> yeah
[04:49:38] <Dus10> I did it for four and a half years
[04:49:47] <Dus10> worked two full-time remote jobs
[04:49:56] <Dus10> it is pretty easy when you automate things :)
[04:58:35] <slaughter> Oh my god the person came back to me with another keyword-based response indicating that it isn't their job to debug our application APIs, despite the fact that all of my questions are specifically about THEIR very own API.

[05:03:07] <lantech19446> i feel ya slaughter I had a vendor contact me today because I'm looking to purchase a web content filter to make us CIPA compliant and he asked me what I'm looking for so I sent him a very straightforward response I said it needs three things I don't want a DNS based solution, it must install locally and filter images as well and it needs to be compatible with windows ios android and chromeos he
[05:03:09] <lantech19446> emails me back that their solution is DNS based with url blacklisting cannot filter images and is only available on windows would that work for me
[05:05:05] <slaughter> lmfao sounds about right
[05:05:09] <slaughter> Perfect, even
[05:05:25] <slaughter> And they'll follow up every 3 days until you buy _something_ from them 
[05:06:11] <lantech19446> if they try that shit i'm puttin em on blast
[05:06:37] <lantech19446> I'm sure you've heard of the company anyway it's currentware
[05:11:39] <slaughter> Nope, literally never heard of them haha
[05:12:01] <slaughter> Oh no I hate what they do I'm glad I haven'theard of them
[05:12:04] <lantech19446> o ok I thought they were pretty big
[05:12:26] <slaughter> I fortunately don't and have not in the past work(ed) at a place that spies on me :(
[05:12:29] <slaughter> :)*
[05:12:55] <lantech19446> yea we had this conversation the other day, as a library worker I hate the idea of censoring information I agree wholeheartedly with the ALA's stance on this but we can't continue to survive without federal funding
[05:13:22] <lantech19446> slaughter: no spying I have no idea what got blocked unless someone tells me themselves
[05:13:36] <lantech19446> I absolutely will not tolerate software that logs that shit
[05:13:48] <slaughter> Well the rest of their stuff is spying, the filtering is less evil just obnoxious
[05:14:00] <lantech19446> o ok I don't know what else they do
[05:14:26] <lantech19446> but yea I feel like i'm succumbing to an evil force on this one it goes against everything the public library is supposed to stand for
[05:14:38] <slaughter> User monitoring, web filtering,
[05:14:39] <slaughter> and device control software
[05:14:39] <slaughter> Block Websites | Track Computer Activity | Stop Data Theft
[05:14:56] <slaughter> Bizarre that's a requirement for funding
[05:18:16] <lantech19446> it's because of the children's internet protection act we have to block anything that is considered harmful to a child mostly only porn and chat. I can disable the filter for adults if requested but I can never lower it for a child even if what they want to view is permitted so I have to walk a very fine line and make sure these kids still have access to information about sexuality lgbt rights etc
[05:18:18] <lantech19446> without it crossing over the line because we're the only place some of these kids will feel safe going for that information
[05:22:49] <slaughter> I guess it's somewhat sensible as a guideline or whatever, but it presumes kids aren't going to find that porn anyway
[05:22:55] <slaughter> Hint: they're gonna find that porn
[05:24:18] <lantech19446> dude you're talking to someone who's been looking at porn since they were 12 I get that they're going to view it I think in some ways if they're mature enough to handle what they're seeing it can even be healthy but they can't view it here even without the filter if I see it they get kicked out it's a first degree felony in pennsylvania
[05:25:35] <lantech19446> ok gotta run work is over, have a good night
