[16:43:54] <sereeds> hello.. I am thinking of running thelounge on my linux box.. is there a way I can trigger scripts on the server, from the client side ?
[16:44:18] <sereeds> I guess the equivalent on ZNC would be the "shell" module
[16:44:58] <fnutt> There is not.
[16:45:12] <sereeds> OK, thanks
[16:45:15] <fnutt> or... well... two seconds...
[16:45:41] <sereeds> I was reading that I can run both ZNC and thelounge.. 
[16:45:54] <fnutt> https://github.com/venatiodecorus/thelounge-plugin-exec might be something you are looking for? or?
[16:45:58] <fnutt> Yes you can.
[16:45:58] <sereeds> Im new to IRC, and just assuming that the shell module is that way to trigger scripts
[16:46:17] <fnutt> What scripts are you talking about?
[16:47:05] <sereeds> I have some that will send me text based performance stats.. or I may need to trigger a service restart
[16:47:43] <fnutt> Alright. Then I have no idea, except for the The Lounge plugin mentioned above.
[16:47:56] <sereeds> yes that plugin looks good, thanks.
[16:47:56] <fnutt> Maybe ZNC can provide this if you put it in front of The Lounge?
[16:49:34] <sereeds> I will test out this plugin, see how it works :-)

[16:50:52] <sereeds> I have been playing with ZNC for a few days, but Im ready to try thelounge now.. that web client is just soooo good looking
[16:51:28] <fnutt> Combine it with https://github.com/MiniDigger/thelounge-theme-mininapse, and we're talking "less is more". ;)
[16:51:47] <fnutt> There are other themes out there as well. https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Athelounge-theme

[16:53:24] <sereeds> thanks.. yes I will be trying out many themes.. love those minial dark ones
[16:53:36] <sereeds> soo what is a shortcut?  like a command alias ?
[16:54:08] <fnutt> Yes
[16:54:51] <sereeds> thanks.. one other noob question.. what does the explaimation mark do?  
[16:55:07] <fnutt> Where?
[16:55:12] <sereeds> !test
[16:55:12] <wendy> sereeds: Error: "test" is not a valid command.
[16:55:38] <sereeds> I seen some people send msgs that start with a "!"
[16:55:52] <fnutt> I assume it has something to do with Libera IRC network and the fact you are not NickServ registered yet.
[16:56:44] <fnutt> ./ns help register
[16:57:24] <fnutt> Then put your NickServ password as password in network config.
[16:57:42] <fnutt> (in The Lounge - which then utilize SASL for authentication)
[16:57:59] <sereeds> OK thanks

[17:18:14] <meena> goood ideaaaa.
[17:21:04] <bookworm> I've a better one 👼
[17:21:09] <bookworm> nuke the command from orbit
[17:21:33] <fnutt> If you do, people will ask for it later down the pipeline.
[17:21:38] <fnutt> I bet!
[17:21:38] <bookworm> so?
[17:21:49] <fnutt> Why nuke a command that is useful?
[17:21:53] <bookworm> because it isn't
[17:22:09] <fnutt> It for sure is.
[17:22:19] <fnutt> and it's a part of the IRC specifications, I believe.
[17:22:24] *** Joins: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp)
[17:22:33] <bookworm> so are other things TL doesn't do or does slightly differently
[17:22:48] <bookworm> TL is for humans, IRC is a protocol :P
[17:22:58] <bookworm> clients can hide the one or other rough corner of IRC
[17:23:04] <fnutt> and humans like both GUI and commands.
[17:23:38] <fnutt> Let us remove /join as well. You can join channels within the GUI.
[17:24:01] <fnutt> and remove /connect and /disconnect. You can do both within the GUI.
[17:24:08] <bookworm> except that action you do frequently, deleting a network? 
[17:24:09] <fnutt> TL is for humans....
[17:24:20] <fnutt> You probably get my point. :)
[17:24:35] <bookworm> no
[17:24:36] <fnutt> Well, I have deleted several networks.

[17:27:20] <fnutt> MaxLeiter: Please just decide on that PR. You can see meena's action which makes the PR #4236 useful. Thanks.
[17:27:21] <thelounge-bot> 07» 09Open pull request 12#4236 - Show quit dialog when using /quit https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4236
[17:27:57] <fnutt> Ref. "<meena> cool, cool, apparently i just quit all of LiberaChat, instead of a single channel"
[17:29:41] <fnutt> bookworm: Would an option be to adjust /quit to quit the current window? E.g. typing it in a pm = close pm. Typing it in a channel = close channel. Typing it in a server window = remove server entierly, since you would /disconnect if you just want to disconnect and not remove it.
[17:30:52] <fnutt> I believe we don't have a command to close pm or channel when they are active.
[17:30:59] <bookworm> context based commands are even worse and prone to confusion
[17:31:23] <bookworm> and sure we do, /part will do the trick
[17:31:42] <bookworm> /close, /leave as well
[17:31:46] <bookworm> those are aliases to the same
[17:32:04] <fnutt> Ah, okey. Nvm my suggestion then.
[17:32:12] <fnutt> Let's merge the PR, please.
[17:32:22] <bookworm> oooor the other thing
[17:33:56] <bookworm> at the very least, IF (and that's an if) we should keep /quit we should rename it. While the docs are accurate, it's not intuitive what it does
[17:34:13] <bookworm> /deleteNetwork would be better and that's something you don't accidentally type
[17:34:55] <bookworm> one of the problems of /quit is that it has very different semantics, depending on the client you are coming from. For some it's even configurable what exactly you want (quitting the client? parting the channel?)
[17:36:54] <bookworm> but that command introduces essentially a nagbar even when you execute a command, which is something TL currently doesn't do and may get in the way if a plugin executes it or some such
[17:37:06] <bookworm> so I don't think that's the solution we want

[18:53:26] <mei> hey, can i prevent nick with lenght <= 2 to be highlight? i see things like "a" and "an" highlighted all the time and is not cool
[18:57:13] <bookworm> Not without modifying the source
[18:57:46] <mei> what about disabling nick highlight in general?
[18:58:09] <bookworm> you can do that with CSS
[18:58:34] <bookworm> (essentially setting the style to the message default)
[18:59:11] <mei> thank you, i'm going to try
[19:05:31] *** Quits: lordfarquad (~lordfarqu@69.160.255.152) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[19:08:07] <mei> it works but i wonder if i can make it apply only to messages
[19:09:13] <bookworm> sure, apply the corresponding selector
[19:10:02] <bookworm> .content should do

[19:18:25] <bookworm> mei `.content > .user` seems to work for me
[19:19:23] <bookworm> Pocky: public? Best bet is to set the default channels in the join settings. private? kinda, if logged in and the lounge is registered as an IRC: protocol handler
[19:19:39] <bookworm> not sure what you are referring to out of those (if any)
[19:19:56] <Pocky> Right now I have it in public mode and have it set for a main channel but I have a website and app where people click to join different channels
[19:20:31] <Pocky> so I have each channel with a link for kiwi and in the link it directs which channel they are joining
[19:21:04] <Pocky> example: https://kiwi/myserver/#channel
[19:21:24] <Pocky> i was wondering if there was a way to do that with thelounge
[19:22:04] <bookworm> no, _MaxLeiter whipped up a PR that implements something like this, but it has some issues as is for bouncers
[19:22:16] <Pocky> oh ok
[19:22:18] <Pocky> thank you
[19:22:55] <Pocky> last thing, so when its set for private mode people make their own account or they need to email me and I make them a username/pass on the back end?
[19:23:17] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4261 for the curious
[19:23:28] <bookworm> the latter, there's no sign up page
[19:23:47] <bookworm> not that you couldn't implement it relatively easily on your own
[19:24:16] <bookworm> do keep in mind that TL doesn't really work for too many people efficiency wise in private mode
[19:24:27] <Pocky> ah ok
[19:24:41] <bookworm> the R conference people hit a roadblock after a few hundred iirc... there's open issues if you want the exact numbers
[19:24:51] <Pocky> my clients really like it in public mode, i was wanting to try to get it setup for every chat room
[19:43:32] <mei> it seems to work only if coloured nicks are disabled though 
[19:46:13] <mei> works with #chat.colored-nicks .content > .user 
[19:50:48] <bookworm> I had colored nicks enabled. But it's cascading style sheets, might very well be that you have a more specific selector doing something else in your theme
[19:51:18] <bookworm> the dev console will tell that to you, at least chrome's
