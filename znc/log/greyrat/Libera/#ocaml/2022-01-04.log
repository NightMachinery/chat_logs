[19:54:00] <octachron> companion_cube, I plead guilty: I generally try to move features out of the extension section once they are finalized.
[19:56:18] <companion_cube> hmmm
[19:57:22] <companion_cube> so, things that should move out include at least, imho: private types, first-class modules, inline records…
[19:57:36] <companion_cube> (probably a lot of the lower numbered items, excep 1>)
[19:57:39] <companion_cube> 1.
[19:57:53] <companion_cube> err, 2.
[20:01:12] *** Joins: mro (~mro@2002:5cc3:87ae:0:a47f:3306:74c:94d6)
[20:07:56] <octachron> For inline records, there might be some issue with their very local nature.
[20:08:11] <octachron> Private types are definitively a good candidate.
[20:08:33] <companion_cube> hmm
[20:08:49] <companion_cube> what do you mean about local records? how could they be improved?
[20:08:51] <octachron> First-class modules, there is the interaction with modular explicits
[20:09:25] <octachron> They don't have typê in the surface language for instance.
[20:09:45] <companion_cube> sure, but it's just like a tuple constructor
[20:10:13] <companion_cube> do you mena it's not finalized because it could be that foo.A could become its own proper type?
[20:10:20] <companion_cube> (for foo=A of {x:int} | B)
[20:12:18] <octachron> Yes, someone might want to be able to name the type of r in `A r -> (r:'a)`
[20:13:11] <companion_cube> I mean I'm all for it, but does it invalidate what's existing?
[20:13:26] <companion_cube> I think people have been suggesting the same in the context of rust, interestingly
[20:14:23] <companion_cube> otoh I understand that "recursive definitions of values" might keep changing, as it already has :)
[20:14:42] <octachron> Probably not. But that is kind of standing issue that might create objection when trying to move the manual section.
[20:15:02] *** Quits: mro (~mro@2002:5cc3:87ae:0:a47f:3306:74c:94d6) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:15:40] <companion_cube> does the extension page even make sense? could there be some sections of the core language that are marked as "extensions" instead?
[20:15:54] <companion_cube> so that all things related to modules are in one place, all things related to sum types, etc.
[20:16:14] <octachron> I will prefer that in fact. But it is not a completely consensual opinion.
[20:17:16] <octachron> It also requires to extend the structure of the manual to have some more advanced topic.
[20:17:38] <octachron> But with the GADT chapter in 4.14, we are slowly moving in this direction.
[20:17:59] <companion_cube> 👍

[22:39:40] <d_bot> <Drup> As someone tried to make a processing-like library in OCaml ?
[22:41:30] <companion_cube> processing what?
[22:42:02] <d_bot> <Drup> https://processing.org/
[22:42:23] <d_bot> <Drup> basically, it's a DSL+libraries for making generative art thingies
[22:42:52] <d_bot> <Drup> the first one is a Java DSL (yikes) and there has been a javascript version (... yikes²)
[22:43:16] <companion_cube> so like a dynamic version of gg/vg?
[22:45:44] <d_bot> <glennsl> One of the first reason projects was a processing clone: https://github.com/Schmavery/reprocessing
[22:46:04] <d_bot> <glennsl> I seem to recall it having backends for native OpenGL too
[22:57:10] <d_bot> <Drup> @companion_cube it's quite a bit more fleshed out than gg/vg, and a bit more geared towards convenience
[23:01:20] *** Joins: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred)

[23:29:35] <d_bot> <glennsl> yea, not surprising as it was one of the first explorations into API design in Reason, and from someone unfamiliar with OCaml I'm pretty sure.
[23:30:05] <d_bot> <glennsl> But the programming model should be basically the same, no? Otherwise I'm not sure what "inspired by" means here...
[23:30:52] <d_bot> <Drup> well, yes, but the programming model is rather not difficult, it's more a question of building in all the nice convenient function
[23:32:29] <d_bot> <Drup> (proper geometry utilities, random gen, noise gen, picture/gif/video emission, etc. Making it all not combersom to use)
[23:32:47] <companion_cube> well maybe JSX helps, though
[23:32:51] <d_bot> <Drup> Lot's of this exists in pieces
[23:33:16] <d_bot> <Drup> it doesn't use HTML, so no, not really
[23:33:45] <companion_cube> there's no link between html and JSX
[23:33:56] <companion_cube> you can use it without any html
[23:34:13] <d_bot> <Drup> I'm not talking about GUI. JSX is really not relevant here 🙂
