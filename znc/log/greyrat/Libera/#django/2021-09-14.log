[01:59:45] <amalgameate> hi, i'm having a peculiar problem with my Django app.  recently, around ~100 times a day, i see the following error: "OperationalError: could not connect to server: Connection timed out".  upon inspecting the traceback, it seems like Django is failing to connect to my RDS postgres server.  the odd thing is, i have ~100 active connections to my Django server going at any given time, and this error only
[01:59:51] <amalgameate> happens intermittently (100 erroring requests per day & ~100K non-erroring request per day).  does anyone know what might be causing this?
[02:00:26] <amalgameate> the traceback i get is: https://gist.github.com/boxbeatsy/dd5d623f8f71339c4f4e08480c574a0e

[10:47:28] <CapnKernel> Hello.  I want to use Multi-table inheritance: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#multi-table-inheritance
[10:47:58] <CapnKernel> If I've retrieved a model instance of the base class, is there a way to promote that to the apprpriate derived model?
[10:50:01] <CapnKernel> It's possible to get a child model instance by accessing the lower case form of the child class off the base class (.restaurant in the django docs link given above)
[10:50:29] <CapnKernel> And it would be possible to iterate over the possible child types looking for an accessor that didn't result in an exception
[10:50:41] <CapnKernel> But it seems a bit gross.
[10:50:55] <CapnKernel> Is there a recommended way of easily getting a child of the right type?
[10:51:06] <shangxiao> CapnKernel: I believe the term you're looking for is "downcasting", the last time I did this there were 2 or 3 libraries that did this for you. One sec I'll find them...
[10:51:33] <shangxiao> ah this was one: https://django-polymorphic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
[10:51:57] <CapnKernel> Thank you!
[10:52:11] <shangxiao> I think this also downcasted: https://django-model-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[10:52:44] <serafeim> i would recommend to double think before using multi-table inheritance
[10:53:23] <serafeim> or any other trickery that ain't backed up properly by sql
[10:53:55] <CapnKernel> I agree that inheritance isn't the architectural savior we were taught it would be.

[14:30:21] <FunkyBob> it's MTI, and specifically in Django
[14:30:56] <CapnKernel> And I well remember the "composition over inheritance" advice at the start of the "Gang of Four" design patterns book.  https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/composition-over-inheritance/

[14:33:00] <shangxiao> I think Funky is talking about single-table inheritance?
[14:33:43] <FunkyBob> no
[14:33:53] <FunkyBob> that's not a thing built into django
[14:33:58] <CapnKernel> Originally I did have a "type" field in the model, and then bunches of fields within the model that were or weren't relevant depending on the value of the "type" field
[14:34:22] <shangxiao> abstract=True
[14:34:25] <CapnKernel> In other words, each row in the table had all the fields evenif they didn't need them
[14:34:34] <CapnKernel> I'm not using abstract = True
[14:35:59] <CapnKernel> Just want to check, abstract = True would give me duplication in the db, and then I couldn't iterate over the one table and pull up subclasses.
[14:36:13] <CapnKernel> I'm happy with how it turned out
[14:36:30] <FunkyBob> so now you have Parent, and Child1, Child2, etc.... how will your system react when a given Parent has more than one Child?
[14:38:10] <CapnKernel> Hmm?
[14:38:23] <CapnKernel> By parent/child, do you mean one table having an fk to another table?
[14:38:32] <CapnKernel> Or in a subclass sense?
[14:39:17] <FunkyBob> well, since you're going the mti path... there's not a lot of difference,
[14:39:23] <FunkyBob> though it'll be a 1to1 field from child to parent
[14:39:27] <CapnKernel> To take what you've said literally, I have a base class derived from models.Model, and four subclasses derived from the base class
[14:39:35] <FunkyBob> but what will it do when Parent has ChildA and a ChildB record?
[14:40:17] <CapnKernel> Yep, Django has autocreated 1_to_1 fields in the derived classes which link to the base class table.

[14:40:37] <FunkyBob> yes

[14:40:44] <CapnKernel> If I have two rows, one of type ChildA (pk=1), and one of ChildA (pk=2)

[14:48:45] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[14:50:24] <FunkyBob> yes, it won't happen easily... but every time I've used mti, it's ended up happening
[14:52:01] <shangxiao> perhaps what's needed is the fk on the base table... ie one for each child table
[14:52:26] <shangxiao> that way at least you can do row-level check constraints to enforce a single child
[14:53:11] <shangxiao> which could be emulated manually :P
[14:53:35] <CapnKernel> And I just tried to .get() an instance of the subclass in python, and changed the .pk to an arbitrary value, then .save()d the subclass.  This should create a new row with the new id, leaving the old row untouched.
[14:53:55] <CapnKernel> Changing subclass.pk had no effect.

[14:54:41] <CapnKernel> So at the moment, everything works just how I expect.
[14:55:00] <CapnKernel> But FunkyBob, I can't discount "every time I've used mti, it's ended up happening" because you so know what you're doing
[14:55:32] <CapnKernel> I'm using it how it says to use it.
[14:55:46] <CapnKernel> Which says to me that the django code might have a bug: It works for simple cases and light loads, but has bugs
[14:59:48] <FunkyBob> it happens through various means... often migrations or other efforts
[15:00:05] <FunkyBob> it really rarely brings enough benefit for the magic involved
[15:01:56] <CapnKernel> I'm hearing you
[15:02:07] <CapnKernel> I'm thinking of one scenario where it could come badly unstuck
[15:02:16] <CapnKernel> And that is operating on an instance of the base class

[15:46:20] <schinckel> https://schinckel.net/2016/04/30/multi-table-inheritance-and-the-django-admin/ was possibly how I ended up doing it, actually.
[15:48:16] <schinckel> FWIW, we have 2208 instances across about 30 different subclasses.
[15:49:31] <schinckel> When you go into the admin you get a single select with the subclasses (and a couple of fields that are on the parent model), and then making a selection reloads the page with the subclass selected (and all of the fields on that model).
[15:49:45] <schinckel> In practice though, we don't use the admin for creation of these instances.

[19:51:18] <amalgameate> hi, i'm getting intermittent "connection timed out" errors from my Django web app which uses a postgres backend hosted on RDS.  the weird thing is that whenever one dyno gets the timeout error, my other dynos hum along just fine (so it doesn't seem like the database is actually going offline).  does anyone know what could be the cause of this?  my web app reuses connections for up to 500s, and my RDS
[19:51:24] <amalgameate> app doesn't time out idle connections until they're 1 day old, so taht doesn't seem to be the problem.

[20:29:15] <CodenameTim> amalgameate: Is it the error that indicates that it can't connect to the full RDS url and the message asks if something is listening on the proper port?
[20:31:52] <CodenameTim> If so, try setting the `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT` environment variable. I've been running into this issue for a month now. I have a heroku support ticket open. They said it has something to do with noisy neighbors on the server causing issues. The other proposed resolution of theirs was to run `heroku ps:stop <dyno>.<index>`, but that wasn't working so well for me recently.

[21:04:19] <amalgameate> our backend is hosted on RDS so our fix may be a bit different.  i've also been looking into a PIP package called django-dbconn-retry which attempts to monkeypatch psycopg2 to retry connecting to the db twice before throwing an operational error

[22:47:33] <amalgameate> i'm still looking for the root cause of the networking issue so we can avoid the monkeypatch.  we run on performance-l dynos (which i think don't run on shared resources?), so i'm not sure i buy that it's just noisy neighbors.
[22:47:38] <CodenameTim> Interesting. I haven't seen connection errors pop up since setting the timeout value (4s as an initial value) and I was getting 30s timeouts on the requests.
[22:48:22] <CodenameTim> You're correct. They indicated that using performance dynos should be immune to the noisy neighbor idea, but I wasn't entirely sold on that explanation given the env variable.

[22:49:27] <amalgameate> you guys host your database on heroku right?  do you by any chance know if the PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT env variable would apply to heroku apps that use a DB hosted on AWS (i.e. RDS)?
[22:51:14] <amalgameate> i think for our RDS setup, i may have to adjust settings.py instead of simply adding a config var.  still trying to figure it out, but will definitely test your solution too.
