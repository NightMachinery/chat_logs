[01:41:25] <Sauvin> How long do you wait before deciding it's hopelessly frozen?

[01:41:55] <rascul> for example if it's X going wonky then it's very possible you can still use a virtual console just fine

[02:33:08] <fakuve> I mean if I restart the VPS it should come back to normal I guess . But if its gonna keep on crashing when using  `apache2` that is not good
[02:33:18] <uwharrie> It's not a kernel bug. You don't want to allow an app in the middle of IO get killed (even with -KILL) because there's a good chance you'll corrupt whatever file you're attempting to write to

[03:39:21] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:39:49] <bpmedley> ayecee : The hope is that the command continues if the ssh connection is broken.
[03:40:08] <bpmedley> Is that correct or is there a better way?

[03:40:22] *** Joins: Betal (~Beta@user/betal)
[03:40:53] <ayecee> does it make sense for the command to continue if it's part of a pipeline
[03:40:57] <ayecee> ?
[03:41:18] <ayecee> oops, i think i misread one of these.
[03:41:29] <bpmedley> ayecee : Perhaps I shoudl set -e or somesuch?  Is that what you are saying?
[03:41:31] <ayecee> that pipeline is all on the remote side.
[03:41:52] <bpmedley> Yes, that's correct.
[03:42:14] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[03:42:36] <bpmedley> Although, that's a great point.  The script might could be more robust and handle disconnects and network strangeness better.
[03:43:38] <ayecee> i wonder if this could be replaced by a script that runs on the remote side, or a script piped into a remote shell as a heredoc, rather than a new ssh session for each command
[03:44:08] <ayecee> i appreciate the simple workflow though. there's a lot to be said for easy to understand.
[03:44:12] <bpmedley> That's interesting!  I wonder which approach would be clearer and simpler.

[03:44:38] *** Joins: bolovanos__ (~bolovanos@user/bolovanos)
[03:44:58] <bpmedley> Maybe almost the entire script would be a heredoc thing using a single ssh connection and nohup?
[03:45:40] <ayecee> nod. for bonus points, make most of the script a function, and have the last line call that function, to ensure the whole thing is received instead of executing partially.
[03:46:08] <bpmedley> I would not of thought of the function.  Thanks.
[03:46:15] <ayecee> i wouldn't have either! :D
[03:46:45] <ayecee> not until i had already written the script without that, probably.
[03:47:07] <neshpion> why not trap the function on EXIT? :D

[03:47:53] <ayecee> is there an advantage to that?
[03:47:53] *** Joins: cpluspunch (~znc@104.200.132.223)
[03:48:06] <bpmedley> Trapping the function on EXIT, if I'm understanding correctly, may have more moving pieces than a single function call at the end.   Said another way, the function trap may be more complicated.
[03:48:31] <ayecee> i feel like it would be bad code smell to trap EXIT for something other than cleanup

[03:51:40] <ayecee> the question is, why aren't you
[03:52:03] <bpmedley> ayecee : Also, what you were saying is that the remote script that would be executed via nohup should have the function, correct?
[03:52:11] <ayecee> bpmedley: yes
[03:52:30] <bpmedley> Great idea and even better now that I understand it.. :-0
[03:52:41] <ayecee> heh
[03:53:46] <ayecee> a remote script piped in via a heredoc, that is. if it's a remote script stored remotely, i don't think that would add much.

[03:55:15] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[03:56:33] <ayecee> as an extra layer on top of that, the remote script could use a lockfile to ensure only one copy runs at a time, if the lockfile program exists on the remote

[03:57:45] <bpmedley> I wonder if the lockfile should be present on the remote or local host.
[03:58:17] *** Joins: sighup (~sighup@cpc119494-heme14-2-0-cust237.9-1.cable.virginm.net)
[03:58:24] <ayecee> if there's a concern that the ssh session could terminate before the remote script does, i think it makes sense to have it on the remote
[03:58:52] *** Quits: codebam (~codebam@user/codebam) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[03:59:47] <ayecee> that way, if the ssh session ends, and you rerun the script, it won't push out another copy while the first is still running
[04:00:16] <bpmedley> So, multiple local invocations can happen and only one remote execution should happen at once?  Possibly, with the remote script outputting a message saying there is a lockfile present?
[04:00:20] *** Joins: codebam (~codebam@user/codebam)
[04:00:22] <ayecee> well it will but that second copy will either abort or wait for the first to complete
[04:00:41] <ayecee> sure
[04:00:42] <bpmedley> Doh, just read the "that way..." message..
[04:01:53] <ayecee> looks like the lockfile program is part of the procmail package. there's probably a way to do lockfiles without that, but that sure would make it easier.

[05:08:20] <uwharrie> The longer the disk is mounted R/W with the system online, the greater the chances of the file's former blocks being overwritten

Im confused since this wasn’t mentioned before and Im assuming it’s important since
[06:35:04] <Void90> the last step is to add it onto my fstab file I also took a peek at GRUB, thinking i screwed that up. Turns out i did misconfigure that and was fixed the lazy way with os-prober. I've just been stuck with LVM/LUKS and don't understand the documentation enough

[08:38:05] <fdan> error; https://dpaste.org/0CmY
[08:38:58] <ekaj> you didn't use visudo to edit /etc/sudoers
[08:39:00] <mlu> fdan: you broke your sudoers file, it seems like
[08:39:16] <fdan> yes and how can i fix it now
[08:39:21] <ekaj> try to log in as root via console or su root
[08:39:24] <fdan> i did by using sudo vi /etc/sudoers
[08:39:54] <ekaj> visudo does error checking so you can't do exactly what you did. unless you're 100% sure what you're doing and don't make mistakes, don't use vi to edit /etc/sudoers
[08:40:08] <ekaj> ( side note, coworker did exactly this today lol )
[08:40:20] <fdan> su root - doesnt accept the root password
[08:40:22] <fdan> oh my god
[08:41:08] <ekaj> physical machine?
[08:41:33] <fdan> yes its a laptop
[08:41:42] <Psi-Jack> Huh, interesting find. Gnome/GTK actually has a separate gtk-key-theme specifically for defining keybindings for things like, cut-clipboard, copy-clipboard, paste-clipboard, etc..
[08:42:12] <ekaj> fdan: try ctrl+alt+f2 if you can and log in as root. to switch back to gui i think it's ctrl+alt+f7

[08:47:34] <fdan> pkexec vi saved the issue ekaj
[08:48:04] <ekaj> nice
[08:48:58] <Psi-Jack> Well, so far, I've swapped Super and Alt, I've created a macos-specific gtk-key-theme and the start of some further similarities. 😀
[08:49:25] <n4dir> Debian(based) uses F1 too now
[08:50:05] <Psi-Jack> I might have to start going as far as finding compatible keycaps that work with LED backlighting and has the macOS Option, Command, and Control keys. heh heh

[11:51:54] <TJ-> jeffreybenzos[m]: as I said, firmware UEFI loads GRUB core (checked with SecureBoot to be valid) GRUB then unlocks its /boot/ file-system so it can load modules and read grub.cfg and load kernel/initrd.img.

It is reponsible for doing a blockchain load of GRUB's core.img file (either from the spare sectors from 1 to start of 1st partition) or, for GPT, reading core.img from the dedicated boot-loader partition
[11:54:38] <TJ-> GRUB's core.img is usually rebuilt on-system each time grub-install/grub-mkimage is executed, and links in the GRUB modules required to open GRUB's /boot/ file-system

Is it possible for a user to disallow other users from directly navigating to the former's HOME/html folder and viewing its contents while still allowing those with a specific url to access individual pages of the website being served from that directory?

[19:51:41] <Thaurwylth> Here's another interesting problem with Firefox, although I think that it may actually be an HP problem, somehow. I have two different laptops with the same version of Ubuntu Studio and at one point they used to also have the same version of Firefox (this will no longer be true, today). One is an HP and the other Lenovo. Sometimes a tab on the HP system randomly starts to behave really mysteriously. The
[19:51:47] <Thaurwylth> ...
[19:51:49] <Thaurwylth> ... activity indicator, whatever icon it is, on the tab starts to blink really wildly and the tab apparently keeps sending a huge amount of refresh requests to whatever web page it is on. At least once one server suspended my requests for a while because of the amount. I tried to skim on some 'Known issues' lists and didn't find this. Has anyone heard about it? And can it indeed be related to the model
[19:51:51] <akik> de-facto: i think not. you should see lines with intel(0)

[20:08:02] <ayecee> i was going to suggest having a terminal around which you could alt-tab to to see if the problem follows focus, but i think moving the keyboard may stop the issue before you can see it.
[20:09:08] <ayecee> as for software, you could create a new user or recreate the existing user's profile, to see if the problem is related to that.
[20:09:18] <Thaurwylth> Well, it usually doesn't follow focus. Apart from that once time I mentioned, it always is bound to one tab. If I go to another tab, the former tab still has the problem but I can for instance close the tab with a mouse after I have activated another one.

[20:43:56] <Thaurwylth> Hey, that brings to mind an old sleeping question I actually have. Is there a readily made program, or anything of the sort, that reads standard text in good quality images into a separate output? Can be a TXT file or some sort of editor window or the system clipboard. And this has to be easily available, like, anyone can install it from the repositories or something like that. Let's assume that the

[20:44:05] <Thaurwylth> ... image is standard font and the text is not tilted and both sides of the text block have the same magnitude. And it has to be an automated process - because if it is not, then you can always simply open the image for view and type in the text in Kwrite by hand, and that's almost as easy as some semi-automated alternative.

[23:10:22] <FakuVe> that is /var/log/journal/fasomethingsomething
[23:10:31] <bparker> if you don't care about the contents, journalctl --vacuum-size=5M or whatever to blow it away, or edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf to make it permanent
[23:10:38] <FakuVe> So all those files can be inspected by `journalctl` ?
[23:10:42] <ayecee> yes
[23:10:44] <bparker> yes
[23:10:47] <FakuVe> oks
[23:10:57] <FakuVe> I'm not really good with that
[23:11:09] <FakuVe> I'm gonna take a look then
