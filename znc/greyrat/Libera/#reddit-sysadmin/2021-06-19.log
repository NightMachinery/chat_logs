[03:08:30] <A-KO> ran into a bug, had to wait until February for the fix. Then IT imploded and tons of people left--and then the pandemic hit.
[03:08:45] <A-KO> and then we were on "don't fucking change anything" mode until we staffed back up
[03:08:48] <A-KO> then ANOTHER management change
[03:08:52] <A-KO> and it's finally fucking done

[03:08:55] <A-KO> holy fucking shit

[03:09:56] <A-KO> this will make all of my developers happy
[03:09:59] <A-KO> they no longer have to do SAML only
[03:10:03] <A-KO> we can use the MS libraries for OIDC now
[03:10:09] <A-KO> and it'll massively simplify their authentication stacks
[03:12:06] <A-KO> I don't have anything against SAML as a protocol, but a large majority of the industry now is on OIDC
[03:12:11] <A-KO> so it's finally nice to support that

[06:09:59] <sd> 06<d‚ÄãMupp3t> e1, if they had fully migrated everything at the front end, then you can delete accounts and transfer the data to a central account.
[06:10:28] <xe0n> ehhh
[06:10:32] <xe0n> prob not the best approach
[06:10:42] <xe0n> but whatever, you got what you needed

[06:10:50] <sd> 06<d‚ÄãMupp3t> Nope. What they should have done, was exported everything to PST

[06:13:33] <e1> @dmupp3t I only ask because we're going the gsuite route and my only issue with it is that we'll have people come and go, and we'll need to give the new user access to the old users emails without consuming an account license and without forcing them to do something hacky, like use outlook
[06:13:43] <e1> because part of the gsuite thing is to remove office from our business

[06:14:19] <sd> 06<d‚ÄãMupp3t> gSuites pricing has forced them to change their business model. They no longer archive emails unless they expect to need them in the future.

[06:15:22] <e1> sadly it also means that when someone leaves, five or more people can be effected
[06:15:26] <sd> 06<d‚ÄãMupp3t> In the off chance someone was important and they may need those emails, they pay the 12$ a month to save the data or have the emails migrated to someone else.
[06:15:32] <e1> And five or more people have it on their phone...
[06:15:32] <CableNinja> you could always alias that account as well e1
[06:15:39] <CableNinja> (to employee name)
[06:16:04] <e1> Yeah it's more for the people who need access to the archives, but their managers want them to have their own name as an email for very valid reasons
[06:16:15] <CableNinja> oh. multiple people accessing the account? gross, use a proper desk system that processes email into tickets
