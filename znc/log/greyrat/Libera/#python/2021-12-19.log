[00:03:46] <arkanoid> is it correct do declare type aliases in .pyi files? I have some quite long types and I'm using aliases to make it easier, but I'd like to declare them once for both .pyi files and project files
[00:03:53] <arkanoid> where should I write those aliases?
[00:04:16] <Wulf> arkanoid: Why not write them into your .py files?
[00:04:31] <Wulf> why use .pyi at all?
[00:05:42] <arkanoid> Wulf: ? writing pyi files for pyright|mypy?

[00:08:05] <Wulf> arkanoid: my own projects don't have .pyi files, type annotations are directly inside my .py files. I'd only write .pyi for third party packages that lack type information.
[00:08:08] <SnoopJ> so if you'd like to write it just once, your annotations can be part of your actual code. Stubs are sort of a third-party way to add annotations to source that doesn't have them.

[02:51:18] <[itchyjunk]> Hi, so __init__() is a "constructor" (a special method that always gets called and initialized variables). but what exactly is self? it's the data the object can hold it seems right? is it just a list of variables ? self.name = "blad" then any method that needs access to this , i pass self then access it via self.name ?
[02:51:50] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well, constructor might not be the right word. initializer is probably the right word (hence init).  `self` is the object
[02:51:59] <bjs> the object is created before __init__ is ran.
[02:52:32] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[02:52:54] <[itchyjunk]> and self.varName creates a new variable that holds data for this object?
[02:52:59] <Wulf> [itchyjunk]: an object is more or less its variables and some other references, e.g. to its type.

[02:53:28] <[itchyjunk]> right object is data and methods to access and change that data i suppose
[02:53:34] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well an object has attributes, and `self.varName = ...` assigns (creating if it doesn't exist) an attribute on the object
[02:53:42] *** Joins: rje (~textual@50.35.241.164)
[02:53:50] <[itchyjunk]> attribute, got it
[02:54:22] <[itchyjunk]> say i don't create some attribute during the __init__() phase, can i still create new attributes for this object after?
[02:54:31] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: sure
[02:54:37] <[itchyjunk]> ah, interesting
[02:55:11] *** Joins: MercilessDeth (~brad@136.49.59.177)
[02:55:14] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: __init__ isn't special really,  it's just like any other method except that Python automatically calls it for you right after the object is created
[02:56:17] <Wulf> [itchyjunk]: you can also create them from the outside. obj = Foo(); obj.abc = "def"
[02:56:58] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[02:57:29] <jinsun> oh I just noticed def is 3 consecutive letters :D
[02:58:06] <Wulf> [itchyjunk]: but if you want nicer code, declare them like this: https://bpa.st/UVDQ
[02:58:38] <[itchyjunk]> oh what magic is that? i didn't know you could type assign things
[02:58:47] <[itchyjunk]> variablename: type ?
[02:58:53] <bjs> no magic, they don't do anything
[02:58:55] <jinsun> or just put a @dataclass over it so you don't have to make the __init__ at all
[02:58:58] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[02:58:58] <bjs> just documentation
[02:59:04] <[itchyjunk]> ah :(
[02:59:05] <Wulf> [itchyjunk]: it's called type annotations. Nothing keeps you from doing obj.abc = 3.14

[03:08:32] <[itchyjunk]> So every method in my class would need to receive a `self` refrence to access any of the attribute it seems.
[03:08:53] <Wulf> [itchyjunk]: yep.
[03:09:39] <jinsun> you can call it whatever you want though, not necessarily self (but don't' do it)
[03:11:10] <jinsun> it is just that when you do obj.func(), obj is passed as the first parameter to func automatically, and it is convention to call that first parameter self
[03:11:59] <velix> Anyone into PIL or pillow? I want to apply a mask and add some add using GaussianBlur. But since it's "L" image, the Blur doesn't fade in alpha, but in white: https://bpa.st/GBOQ
[03:12:19] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: every method has `self`, and Python automatically passes it  to your method for you (when you go `obj.foo()`).  Really it's no different than passing your obj to other functions or methods.
[03:12:41] <bjs> It's just that,  like with __init__,  Python is doing it for you automatically to make things nicer

[03:14:24] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well if you leave out self probably it will error when Python tries to pass self to it
[03:14:51] <[itchyjunk]> py will only try to pass it if i want access to some attribute?
[03:14:54] <bjs> like if you had `def f()` then tried to `f(42)`  you get an exception.
[03:15:00] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: no Python always passes it, when you call a method.
[03:15:04] <[itchyjunk]> or `def fun(slef)` is mandatory?
[03:15:09] <[itchyjunk]> oh.. sounds like mandatory then
[03:15:20] <jinsun> yeah you can't leave out, you can  name it something else but bad idea to do that
[03:15:21] <Repiphany> You can decorate it with @staticmethod
[03:15:46] <bjs> Yes your methods must have at least 1 parameter (aka "self"),  there are ways to tell Python "dont pass self" (e.g. with staticmethod and classmethod) but you generally don't use them
[03:16:01] <[itchyjunk]> my first classes ended up looking like this : https://bpa.st/5HUA
[03:16:32] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: that looks okay,  in Python we typically don't have get* and set* methods because you can just read and write attributes from anywhere
[03:16:44] <[itchyjunk]> ohhh

[04:24:08] <stwange> Can anyone recommend a good Python book or course for someone who can already code? I've learnt structure and basics by taking a contract to rewrite some code, but I have a feeling I'm writing terrible (or at least, not Python-like) code and I want to improve. This is exactly the kind of question I don't trust Google for

[04:28:12] <leitz> stwange, yup. I'm looking up the URLs now.
[04:28:13] <SnoopJ> stwange, the official tutorial is quite useful if you already know how to program. Think Python 2e is good and free, and Automate the Boring Stuff is also. Both are well-liked by this community.

[07:53:12] <SnoopJ> mike18, --workers controls the number of workers that can be running simultaneously. --timeout controls the amount of time (in seconds) that a worker can be 'silent' (not communicating with the main process).

[07:54:08] <SnoopJ> One request going to multiple workers sounds like it should be an impossibility, but if you don't remember I guess there's not much to talk about

[07:57:58] <SnoopJ> If it's a program we could have a look at, someone might be better able to understand the question. I wouldn't think a gunicorn worker would ever be "rendering a UI", that's usually the client's problem.

[08:01:39] <mike18> by rendering i mean providing the data in form of a template

[08:03:41] <SnoopJ> Oh, I see what you mean. A worker would be responsible for preparing whatever the response will be.
[08:04:38] <SnoopJ> Which should include filling in a template or whatever, as far as I know. I think the main process is really just coordinating/monitoring the workers, it's not concerned as much with application logic I think (except where a worker has failed and it needs to respond)

[08:27:27] <SnoopJ> I found myself writing a lot of validators with Flask that are "just" a properly constructed Pydantic class with FastAPI, so I appreciate not having to think about all that plumbing.
[08:27:48] <mike18> validator for what purpose?
[08:28:01] <SnoopJ> To make sure request data is valid, usually.
[08:28:08] <mike18> oh
[08:28:15] <mike18> i skipped that for now ^^
[08:28:32] <mike18> since data in the ui is what the server sends (valid)
[08:28:41] <mike18> and user can select only
[08:29:58] <SnoopJ> We mostly use it in this kind of mode of operation, and it saves us a lot of headaches the way FastAPI does it because the error reports say fairly specifically what's going wrong and can be made even better.

[08:30:39] <SnoopJ> We can't always blindly trust what the UI sent us to be correct, it changes a lot.
[08:31:23] <mike18> is your backend code also async?

[08:32:24] <SnoopJ> It's usually synchronous, but we have some messed around with async a bit, and FastAPI makes it easy to go async since Starlette (the underlying web server) is fully aware of ASGI
[08:32:45] <SnoopJ> usually you change `def someroute(...):` to `async def someroute(...):` and things Just Work
[08:33:00] <mike18> and thread pooling?
[08:34:37] <SnoopJ> What about it? Starlette uses a threadpool for handling synchronous routes in an ASGI application
[08:35:32] <mike18> if you use a threadpool in your backend to process data
[08:35:47] <mike18> how to make that async?

[09:03:26] <SnoopJ> It's okay to write your route handlers as synchronous functions with Starlette. If it needs to, it handles running the route in a threadpool using anyio using a relatively simple mechanism: https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/05d531483a37f1d4e023eece13dd801daba5e818/starlette/routing.py#L51-L66
[09:04:20] <SnoopJ> so it's really built around the idea of asynchronous code and synchronous stuff is adapted into that model

[17:45:32] <Helenah> Wulf, Lets say I want 'foo' to be in bold, I have to pass '[foo]' to the program. I've found reason why I might want to output '[foo]' instead of parsing the brackets so I wanted to do something like this '\[foo\]'

[17:46:43] <Helenah> Wulf, The program is wrote to do it, if you pass '[foo]' then it will output 'foo' in bold.
[17:47:26] <\\> In this case you might want to just want a simple replace on the brackets with escaped brackets

[20:48:46] <nedbat> in this case, you should choose the clearer code.
[20:49:27] <nedbat> Ingvix: the only way to know which is faster is to measure it, but the difference is going to be microscopic compared to the rest of your program.
[20:49:33] <Ingvix> if the fastest way isn't the clearest I'd say the language is at fault

[21:37:09] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i vaguely understand a[starting index:stop index +1], but i dont understand why a[len(a):] = [blah] adds to the end of the list. len(a) returns the length so for a = [1,2,3], len(a) woudl return 3. so a[len(a):] = a[3:3] but because of 0 indexing, a[2:3] should be the location of the last element? why does a[3:3] not error?

[22:18:37] <hseg> Hi. Am seeing advice not to modify a list while iterating over it. The pathological cases seem to remove elements from the list. Am I correct in assuming that appending elements to the list is safe though?
[22:19:03] <hseg> (am abusing a list as a work queue, some elements of which may call for more work)
[22:19:18] <hseg> (and enque multiple new work items)
[22:19:48] <bjs> hseg: well both are "safe",  Python lets you do it you just might get weird behaviour.  appending to the end works and the iteration will just loop over them when it gets to them
[22:19:59] <Repiphany> `while queue: queue.pop(0)`
