[07:06:56] <asivitz> not sure what the right place to ask is, but stack is segfaulting when I use it for basically anything. I got stack from nixpkgs. this is on an m1 mac. anyone seen this before?
[07:07:27] <dsal> asivitz: What system?
[07:08:04] <asivitz> system?
[07:08:14] <dsal> You can override the system in /etc/nix/nix.conf
[07:08:40] <asivitz> hm no override there. (I am brand new to nix)
[07:09:05] <dsal> Ah.  It used to ship as aarch64, but it works natively now.  I've not done a recent install, so I don't know where it leaves you.
[07:09:20] <dsal> What does  "file `which nix`" say?
[07:09:42] <asivitz> `/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin/nix: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64`
[07:09:58] <dsal> Huh.  What about stack?
[07:10:09] <asivitz> same
[07:10:38] <asivitz> it can run --help and --version. seems to die when running ghc
[07:10:39] <dsal> Interesting.  I'm not using a global install, but otherwise that's basically what I'm doing.  Is this a recent project?
[07:10:55] <dsal> i.e., that combination would only work on a fairly recent LTS.
[07:11:10] <dsal> e.g., lts-18.16

[07:16:17] *** Joins: mbuf (~Shakthi@223.178.89.16)
[07:17:29] <asivitz> yea. FWIW I'm familar with stack. but... it bombs immediately when I run any non-trivial command (other than help or version). like it should read my stack.yaml and download the defined ghc and then use that to build other stuff, but it never gets to any of that. so the stack binary itself is messed up somehow... but it is the right arch seemingly :(
[07:18:39] <dsal> stack nix integration is slightly different.
[07:18:48] <asivitz> for your setup- you skip stack and turn the stack.yaml into a nix derivation? (do I have that right?)
[07:18:55] <asivitz> I thought just using stack would be simpler but maybe not
[07:19:02] <Lycurgus> lol
[07:19:30] <Lycurgus> (you saved me a status check)
[07:19:44] <dsal> my ~/.stack/config.nix has "nix:\n  enable: true" and my stack projects look like... let me find one.

[08:53:12] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.114.190)
[08:53:18] <jackdk> If you parsed AttributeValue into a better AST and then had `x :: Prism' a b` and `y :: Lens' b (Maybe c)`, could you then get a `Lens' a (Maybe c)`? Feels more plausible, anyway
[08:54:16] <nshepperd> however i think if you have a concept of a "default value" for b, you can convert Lens' a (Maybe b) to Lens' a b

[13:29:49] <tomsmeding> in a stack it might depend on what exactly is above it?
[13:29:59] <kuribas> carbolymer: That doesn't evaluate the function, it creates a new IO monad.
[13:30:21] <carbolymer> kuribas: by function you mean x?
[13:30:29] <carbolymer> tomsmeding: damn, I forgot that bind can be lazy
[13:30:29] <kuribas> carbolymer: no (\x -> ..)
[13:31:54] <tomsmeding> kuribas: point is whether writing that will ensure that x is evaluated before any further evaluation is done in the monad
[13:32:44] <carbolymer> yeah, going step back, I have `act :: m a`, I want to evaluate `a` when evaluating `act`
[13:32:45] <kuribas> tomsmeding: yes, to hnf
[13:32:46] <tomsmeding> like, readFile "a.txt" >>= (\x -> x `deepseq` pure x) >>= (\x -> deleteFile "a.txt" >> doSomethingWith x)
[13:32:57] <tomsmeding> kuribas: point is, depends on the monad
[13:33:06] <tomsmeding> >>= may be lazy, in which case no, it will not evaluate
[13:33:52] <tomsmeding> oh I misplaced some parens
[13:34:03] <tomsmeding> like, readFile "a.txt" >>= (\x -> x `deepseq` pure x >>= (\x -> deleteFile "a.txt" >> doSomethingWith x))
[13:34:05] <tomsmeding> I think
[13:34:52] <tomsmeding> carbolymer: what kind of monads are on top, if they require sequencing in the underlying IO monad for every >>= of the stack, then it'll probably evaluate
[13:35:04] <tomsmeding> but I think there are other monads that have lazy bind
[13:35:39] <tomsmeding> s/have lazy bind/do their bind magic within itself, only calling underlying >>= once in a while or something/
[13:35:44] <carbolymer> tomsmeding: ReaderT and ExceptT, I guess you're right, this should evaluate in my case
[13:35:51] <tomsmeding> yeah those are well-behaving
[13:36:11] <tomsmeding> was thinking along the lines of ContT or LogicT or what have you
[13:36:18] * tomsmeding doesn't actually know how those things work
[13:37:02] <carbolymer> yeah, in our team we aren't eager into jumping into that voodoo stuff, we have a lot of fun with laziness already ;]

[13:45:46] <tomsmeding> or hm, maybe it ends up being strict anyway
[13:45:51] <carbolymer> yeah, seems to be strict
[13:47:37] <carbolymer> hmm, but why?
[13:48:48] <tomsmeding> because even >> traverses its left argument

[13:58:37] <tomsmeding> dumb joke, because <$ is in Control.{Applicative,Monad} while $> is in Data.Functor
[13:59:02] <kuribas> right, strange indeed
[14:01:33] <carbolymer> tomsmeding: yeah, but https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.6.0.2/docs/src/Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Lazy.html#line-206 has irrefutable patterns, so it kind of explicitly encodes laziness in Monad instance - so `>>` is strict by default?
[14:01:49] <ocramz[m]> imagine what kind of shouting match if we were to move <$ and $> to the same module
[14:02:21] <tomsmeding> carbolymer: note that WriterT doesn't specialise >>
[14:02:27] <tomsmeding> so the strictness can't come from >>
[14:02:37] <tomsmeding> ocramz[m]: heh yes
[14:03:50] <tomsmeding> carbolymer: note that the irrefutable patterns are not essential; that >>= can also be written: m >>= k = WriterT $ runWriterT m >>= \p -> runWriterT (k (fst p)) >>= \q -> return (fst q, snd p `mappend` snd q)
[14:04:00] <tomsmeding> using fst/snd instead of irrefutable patterns, same semantics
[14:04:29] <carbolymer> tomsmeding: but you demonstrated the laziness of `>>` in lazy Writer
[14:04:49] <tomsmeding> which inherits laziness from >>=
[14:04:50] *** Joins: lavaman (~lavaman@98.38.249.169)
[14:05:55] <tomsmeding> I wonder if lazy Writer becomes strict if you do 'WriterT StrictIdentity', where StrictIdentity doesn't have 'm >>= k = k (runIdentity m)' but '!m >>= k = k (runIdentity m)'
[14:06:17] <carbolymer> tomsmeding: so that bind oneliner you wrote is also lazy?
[14:06:26] <tomsmeding> the fst/snd one? yes
[14:06:34] <tomsmeding> it's completely equivalent to the ~() version
[14:08:05] <carbolymer> I think I don't see it (yet)
[14:08:43] <tomsmeding> that equivalence? or where the laziness comes from
[14:08:49] <tomsmeding> I'm also not completely sure yet about the latter
[14:08:59] <carbolymer> the laziness
[14:15:39] <tomsmeding> ah, making Identity strict indeed defeats the laziness of lazy Writer
[14:16:10] <tomsmeding> carbolymer: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/iVwhUJ6g
[14:16:28] <tomsmeding> only difference between Identity and SIdentity is that SIdentity's bind operator is strict, as you can see
[14:16:40] <tomsmeding> mapWriter' is just mapWriter but then for SIdentity
[14:17:03] <tomsmeding> thing1 produces 'WriterT (Identity (2,""))', while thing2 produces WriterT (SIdentity (*** Exception: Prelude.undefined'
[14:17:17] <carbolymer> so now I don't understand why list's `>>` is strict ;]
[14:18:10] <tomsmeding> carbolymer: >> = *> for lists, and in *> you see that in order to produce items of the result list, you have to evaluate the spine of the left-hand argument to *>
[14:19:12] *** Quits: geekosaur (~geekosaur@xmonad/geekosaur) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:19:16] <tomsmeding> so the spine (i.e. monad structure) of the result list is dependent on the spine (monad structure) of the left argument
[14:19:33] <carbolymer> tomsmeding: so this is because of this pattern match: `xs *> ys  = [y | _ <- xs, y <- ys]` ?
[14:19:40] <tomsmeding> yeah talking about that one
[14:20:16] <tomsmeding> if xs is [], the result is []; if xs is _ : _, the result depends on ys
[14:20:28] <carbolymer> so this means that list comprehension is strict?
[14:20:38] <tomsmeding> so evaluating (xs >> ys) to WHNF requires evaluation of xs to WHNF -- to check whether it's [] or _:_
[14:21:00] <tomsmeding> it must be! because the outermost constructor of the result depends on the inputs :p

[14:30:07] <tomsmeding> though Writer in particular also allows you to reason on a higher level: strict WriterT adds strictness, while lazy WriterT doesn't. So it's lazy only if the underlying monad is lazy and you're using lazy WriterT

[16:36:19] <dminuoso> Mmm
[16:36:49] <dminuoso> I think there's an earlier piece that Im missing
[16:36:52] <tomsmeding> the key thing here, I believe, is that type classes are _open_
[16:37:18] <tomsmeding> if they were closed, i.e. ghc could be sure there are no more instances floating around that it doesn't know of, then the ~ version and the 'a a' version would be equivalent
[16:37:45] <tomsmeding> but because type classes are open, ghc doesn't know that there might not be some other 'GenConst a b' instance around that it should select if the two arguments are _not_ equal
[16:38:00] <dminuoso> Maybe Im actually confused about your construction of the base case to begin with
[16:38:07] <tomsmeding> so ghc can't pick the 'GenConst a a' instance if it isn't already sure that the arguments are the same
[16:38:36] <tomsmeding> whereas writing 'GenConst a b' precludes the existence of any other such instance, so ghc can freely pick this one

[16:53:48] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: no, type classes are open, ghc cannot assume it sees all instances in scope
[16:54:02] <tomsmeding> compare 'type family F a ; type instance F Int = ... ; ...' with 'type family F a where ...'

[17:00:21] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: The error message was that the type variable 'a0' is ambiguous though
[17:00:34] <dminuoso> But I guess your point is:
[17:01:11] <dminuoso> GHC doesnt have a mechanism to monomorphize and introduce that constraint in the type checker in general, since in the general case it doesnt make sense in an open world assumption
[17:01:31] <dminuoso> Since I might as well have written something like `f = genConst forbidden` and exported `f`
[17:01:46] <dminuoso> Err `f = constG forbidden`, and exported `f`. here we go.
[17:02:00] <tomsmeding> I think so, yes
[17:02:13] <tomsmeding> the justifications and details of the algorithm I also don't know :p
[17:02:19] <dminuoso> Strictly speaking, inside this compilation unit, GHC could have safely made that unfiication
[17:02:31] <dminuoso> Or introduced that constraint
[17:02:50] <tomsmeding> I suspect that writing that F [T] instance in another module would be technically invalid
[17:03:14] <tomsmeding> just like defining the same name in two different compilation units in C/C++ might work sometimes but is technically undefined behaviour

[19:19:48] <Franciman> for a clone of napsters?
[19:19:57] <maerwald> now you read the code... and your functions fire different effects everywhere and they are intertwined, maybe through remote state... so you jump to the handler, but that doesn't make sense on its own
[19:21:03] <Franciman> so you are basically arguing that having this concept gets you nothing because it's so powerful you get fully side effected code
[19:21:05] <Franciman> it's like coding in C

[20:53:26] <moet> Guest68: the way this is done in larger companies is: after your production service starts up it requests credentials scoped to the task it needs to perform from some credentialing service.. there needs to be material provided to auth against the credentialing service, and the credentialing service should also look up the identity of the requester in a table, etc.. all of that might be too much for your use 
[20:53:32] <moet> case
[20:54:13] <moet> Guest68: a simpler approach would be to have your deployment system provide the creds to the production service at startup, though instead of envvars or the cli, write them to stdin
