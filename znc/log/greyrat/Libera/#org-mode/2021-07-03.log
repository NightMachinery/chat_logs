[00:34:37] <afidegnum> is it possible to pass header argument values to code blocks? i.e I have #+PROPERTY: header-args:sql+   :dbuser postgres I want to pass :dbuser postgres to the connection argument in python. i. e conn = psycopg2.connect("... user=<postgres> ...")

[01:09:29] <afidegnum> coda: so do i need to change the initial header properties: #+PROPERTY: header-args:sql+   :dbhost localhost to :var: dbhost localhost? what about multiple variables? how do i set their sessions?
[01:09:33] <afidegnum> i'm still a bit confused
[01:12:46] <coda> afidegnum: in PROPERTIES you can set ':header-args: :var myvar="some text"
[01:14:10] <coda> and then append with :header-args+: :var anothervar="another text"
[01:14:52] <afidegnum> isn't what i did? https://dpaste.org/52ZO
[01:15:56] <coda> syntax looks different
[01:16:37] <afidegnum> ouch!
[01:16:51] <afidegnum> can you please give an example ?

[01:21:49] <ngz> I think you are both talking of two different things.
[01:22:16] <ngz> afidegnum's example is about document-level properties, and you're writing node properties.
[01:22:56] <afidegnum> ok
[01:24:35] <coda> ngz: with #+PROPERTY: you are right. But https://dpaste.org/52ZO is a node property.
[01:25:14] <ngz> It isn't.
[01:25:28] <coda> ngz: shouldn't it be the same syntax?
[01:25:48] <ngz> But perhaps afidegnum meant to write node properties. I didn't read the backlog.
[01:26:29] <coda> ngz: guess, he has to tell us ...
[01:27:54] <coda> at least, I know that my header-args work.
[01:28:48] <ngz> Their example works to (after a C-c C-c on a keyword)
[01:29:28] <coda> then, where's the problem?
[01:29:42] <ngz> I don't know :)
[01:29:59] <afidegnum> well, the issue, is I'm having elisp, sql and python code which are inter-dependent. i.e, i want parameters used in sql queries, should be the same when using python to connect to same db
[01:30:33] <afidegnum> so i believe i need to set up a top parameter which will cover them, 
[01:30:42] <afidegnum> but getting confused along the line, 
[01:33:43] <coda> afidegnum: I always need to test a lot when I setup a new org-block environment.
[01:36:47] <afidegnum> yes, but how do i use those arguments in the code block, that's where I need assistance, 
[01:37:50] <coda> the example I gave (:var) provides environment variables.
[01:39:55] <coda> other variables depend on the context and need to be named appropriate.
[01:41:01] <coda> i.e. instaed of :var, if you need to set a header-arg "db" it's :db

[02:02:20] <afidegnum> lol, i don't get it, I applied the command as suggested, i've noticed the list of variables opened in a new frame, but i'm wondering if ti's from the variable, 
[02:03:37] <ngz> C-c C-v C-v shows you the real block, as Babel will process it upon evaluation.
[02:04:35] <ngz> It's a proof that, for example, variable dbhost is set to the "localhost" string. You can use dbhost binding in your code with that in mind.
[02:06:02] <afidegnum> conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=suppliers user=postgres password=postgres") I was expecting it to use the binding from the header properties 
[02:07:25] <coda> afidegnum: does it work now? I'd replace ''#+PROPERTY: header-args :var' with just ':header-args: :var' and use '#+PROPERTY' only outside ':PROPERTIES: ... :END:'
[02:08:30] <ngz> I don't know the syntax for connect method, but : conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=" + dbname + "user=" + dbuser + "password=" dbpass) should use your variables.
[02:08:47] <afidegnum> this is the code block head: #+begin_src python :results output :exports code
[02:09:03] <afidegnum> ok, 
[02:09:20] <ngz> I forgot a + before the dbpass, but you get the idea.
