[00:00:03] <indigo> However, yes, there are people that get hired that are exceptionally poor coders
[00:00:16] <gwozniak> We're more than willing to train someone for a while, but not the level of training that would be needed for the person we talked to earlier
[00:00:44] <indigo> Also if you happen to have a PhD, you get hired at mid-level instead of entry-level
[00:01:18] <gwozniak> When the person you're talking to clearly doesn't know what the execution stack is, then you know you're dealing with someone who needs too much training
[00:01:32] <indigo> Leveling is also determined by your interview performance. I always likened it to having the SAT determine your placement in college (freshman, sophomore, etc)
[00:03:20] <ngoldbaum> yeah i’m sure my phd in astronomy will help me with distributed databases or whatever
[00:04:14] <indigo> Pretty much :) or just in general: how to work on a software project with other engineers, good practices, etc
[00:05:15] <river> i mean
[00:05:43] <river> having a phd in astronomy is kind of a positive
[00:06:24] <indigo> Is it enough of a positive to get hired as a mid-level over an entry-level software engineer though? Maybe if the domain was astronomy, but otherwise?
[00:07:04] <indigo> I see it as a concession prize: "we see you spent many more years in academia, you've got some letters after your name, so here's a pay bump"
[00:08:09] <quanticle> The way I see it is, "You've proven you have some IQ and conscientiousness, so we're willing to recognize that"
[00:08:33] <quanticle> I wonder what fraction of PhD candidates just totally *bomb* the interview
[00:09:10] <quanticle> Like to the point where the interviewer is asking themselves, "How did this person get a PhD? Does this person even have a real PhD?"
[00:09:21] <river> also thats so cool
[00:09:52] <indigo> I don't think most software engineering interviews go into depth on what a person studied in their academic career
[00:10:23] <indigo> It's mostly data structures and algorithms stuff
[00:11:47] <ngoldbaum> quanticle: my impression of the google interview process is it’s basically a random roll of the dice if you happen to know the answers
[00:11:53] <indigo> Not even super specialized DS&A too; like I doubt you'd get asked a question where you would need to use union find or implement Knuth-Morris-Pratt
[00:12:29] <ngoldbaum> leetcode caliber
[00:12:36] <ngoldbaum> leetcode exists as a thing for a reason
[00:12:59] <ngoldbaum> a lot of companies don’t use leetcode style questions anymore though
[00:13:11] <indigo> Leetcode has harder questions (and solutions) than are asked at a usual interview though.. so you have to be careful when studying ;)
[00:13:37] <indigo> People really like posting their O(really small) solutions that would be impossible to whip up in an interview
[00:17:22] <indigo> ngoldbaum: I'm glad that there are companies that buck the trend
[00:18:17] <indigo> AFAIK there is no data to show that interviewing in this style hires higher-performing engineers
[00:18:43] <manicennui> I think companies should stop pretending that they are looking for computer scientists except in the rare cases when they are.
[00:23:33] <quanticle> I've been through the Google interview process a couple times (no offers, though). I guess maybe I'm jaded, but I didn't really find the interview process all that surprising.
[00:23:53] <quanticle> Yes, they asked me a bunch of data structures and algorithms questions. No I was not prepared, because I have a day job.
[00:24:24] <quanticle> The two people I know who got offers from FAANG both quit their jobs so that they could spend a couple of months full time studying
[00:29:46] * ngoldbaum inverts a binary quanticle
[00:30:31] <indigo> quanticle: I didn't quit my job, but I did go through a very stressful time doing a few leetcode questions every day after work
[00:31:23] <quanticle> ngoldbaum: "Queering the gender binary tree"
[00:35:55] <manicennui> I guess I can't really understand wanting to work at Google that badly.
[00:36:42] <manicennui> The majority of their engineers are just working on boring shit like adwords.

[00:37:35] *** Joins: harrow (~harrow@static.38.6.217.95.clients.your-server.de)
[00:38:36] <mgdm> I knew someone who was bored of maintaining a particular product, so he went looking around and got a job with a consultancy. He was the last person who understood the old product at his previous job, so that company went around looking for someone to look after it, so hired his consultancy and he ended up right back on the same product (though I would hope on a better salary)
[00:39:26] <ngoldbaum> lmao probably worse
[00:39:36] <ngoldbaum> i’m sure his old job is paying the consultancy more
[00:39:48] <ngoldbaum> i guess unless he’s a partner in the consultancy :p
[00:40:44] <gwozniak> This happened at IBM a lot
[00:40:48] <mgdm> yeah, I'm not sure of the details, but I hoped it worked out for him even allowing for the margin etc
[00:41:12] <quanticle> manicennui: As someone who does have a FAANG on his resume, the sad truth is that it does open doors
[00:41:14] <gwozniak> People would retire, then be hired back as consultants because they were the only ones who knew old systems
[00:41:33] <mgdm> Ah yes, I had a hand in decommisioning something IBM were looking after for us. From a staff of hundreds a few years ago to maybe 3 people offshore remained when we shut it down
[00:41:43] <gwozniak> Those consultants could only be hired for 4 years, I think
[00:41:48] <gwozniak> No idea why
[00:41:54] * quanticle did Amazon and Microsoft and yeah, I get a *lot* more interest from recruiters and companies than people who don't have those two magic words on their resume
[00:42:21] <quanticle> gwozniak: Probably some regulation that says that if they've worked with your company for >4 years you have to treat them like employees
[00:42:37] <gwozniak> Yes, I expect it's something like that
[00:43:45] <gwozniak> Oh nice. Some code that seems unnecessary just made debugging a helluva lot easier

[00:45:32] <quanticle> So I don't know if any of you heard about or remember that abortive Florida legislation that would have restricted social media companies from deplatforming people
[00:45:42] <quanticle> It got overturned by the courts (of course)
[00:45:48] <quanticle> But I am a *bit* sad that it did
[00:46:18] <quanticle> Why? Because it contained a provision that would have *mandated* that social media companies offer an option for users to switch to a strictly chronological feed
[00:46:26] <quanticle> Without any algorithmic weighting
[00:47:13] <mgdm> lol, I remember that being a thing but not that detail
[00:47:15] <quanticle> (Also, the law contained a carve-out for any company that operated a theme park in Florida that got more than a million visitors a year; I would have loved to visit Twitter-topia)
[00:47:38] <mgdm> Hmm I wonder who that might be
[00:47:38] <quanticle> (Ride the cancel-coaster)
[00:47:47] * mgdm looks at the last 100 years of copyright law development
[00:48:16] <manicennui> quanticle: I don't doubt that many employers would look favorably upon seeing FAANG experience, but I think it mostly opens doors at other FAANG companies, none of which I have any desire to work at.
[00:48:24] * quanticle puts the mouse ears away, whistling innocently, "Yeah, no, I have no idea. It's very strange."

[00:57:23] <manicennui> Like Uber helped with a lot of things that sucked about cabs, especially for people in areas where cabs were hard to find, but Uber drivers are also fucking terrible at knowing where they are going and how to drive in major cities, because most of them are from the burbs.
[00:57:31] <manicennui> And Uber does their own annoying shit.
[00:57:56] <bkero> It's not just the drivers.
[00:58:15] <manicennui> I can hop in a cab and give a vague description of where I want to go, or just the name of the place if it is even remotely well known, and they know how to get there.

[00:59:43] <manicennui> If you are familiar with driving in Chicago there is a good chance you have taken lower Wacker drive.
[00:59:51] <manicennui> Uber drivers have no idea what they are doing down there.
[00:59:54] <manicennui> GPS stops working.
[01:00:13] <manicennui> Some of them learn, but a lot of them are just utterly lost if their phone doesn't tell them what to do.
[01:00:40] <manicennui> (That's right, we have double decker streets)
[01:02:59] <manicennui> Actually the buildings downtown fuck with GPS pretty hard in general.
[01:03:02] <manicennui> And the train.
[01:07:18] <quanticle> Dallas has double-decker freeways. The top deck is an express lane that doesn't the same exits as the lower lanes. It's for "through traffic". So imagine me, unfamiliar with the Dallas area, getting on the top deck of this freeway somehow. GPS tells me, "Take the exit in a quarter mile." What exit?
[01:08:59] *** Quits: companion_cube (~simon@user/companion-cube) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[01:09:29] <manicennui> Our express lanes on some highways are on the inside, with the same deal though. You can't exit everywhere.
[01:12:00] <indigo> Oh man I hate double decker roads
[01:12:09] <indigo> There was one in DTLA that fucked with me
[01:13:00] <manicennui> Lower Wacker is usually a good way to avoid some traffic, but then the exits back to the surface are backed up.
[01:15:50] <manicennui> bkero: Just skimming this article, but I realize that I don't know very much about airline deregulation, or what the supposed benefits were.
[01:16:49] <bkero> The American Affairs Journal or Doctorow?
[01:17:45] <manicennui> The former.
[01:17:59] <bkero> Ah that's a good place to start, definitely.

[01:21:04] <manicennui> "And unlike Uber’s totally laissez-faire objec­tives, airline deregulation was strictly limited to liberalizing entry and pricing limitations, while actually strengthening antitrust, con­sumer, and labor protections, as well as financial reporting rules."
[01:21:08] <manicennui> That's kind of what I expected.
[01:21:15] <manicennui> It's a buzzword that is far more nuanced.

[01:51:57] <ngoldbaum> yes?
[01:52:02] <manicennui> What is the proper order for these Evangelion movies on Prime?
[01:52:18] <manicennui> And should I watch the TV show first, or in between some of them, or not at all, or it doesn't matter?
[01:52:34] <quanticle> The movies are a remake of the TV show and go beyond it
[01:52:38] <bkero> TV show, movie, End of Evangelion, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 + 1.0.
[01:52:43] <quanticle> The first movie is a retelling of the TV show
[01:53:00] <river> did it really need retelling?
[01:53:12] <bkero> It deviates from the show about halfway through
[01:53:19] <manicennui> bkero: Prime has 1.11, 2.22, 3.33, and 3.0 + 1.0
[01:53:23] <quanticle> I'd actually recommend TV Show (but skip the last two episodes), End of Evangelion, then 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0 + 1.0
[01:53:24] <bkero> They retconned some shit and introduced a few new characters that took the story in a different direction
[01:53:36] <quanticle> river: It really really did not
[01:53:37] <bkero> and not in a good way
[01:53:41] <river> lol
[01:54:06] <manicennui> I mostly assumed numerical order, but was not entirely sure about 3.33 and 3.0 + 1.0.
[01:54:56] <manicennui> Oh, I didn't know this was a post apocalyptic world.
[01:55:00] <manicennui> Now I'm more interested.
[01:56:00] <quanticle> I was doing some comparisons between the TV show and the first movie and it's remarkable how they didn't even screw things up by adding scenes and retconning, but Anno managed to make things worse even in the scenes that he did preserve. The biggest complaint is that he added lots of visual flair (AT field effects! background explosions!) which actually reduces the emotional impact of the
[01:56:03] <quanticle> scene by taking emphasis away from the characters and their dialogue
[01:56:41] <quanticle> manicennui: Also, how much other anime have you watched?
[01:56:55] <quanticle> And specifically, how much other *mecha* anime have you watched?
[01:57:22] <manicennui> No mecha anime.
[01:57:32] <manicennui> Very little anime in general outside of Studio Ghibli.
[01:57:54] <quanticle> Uh... well, I won't *disrecommend* Evangelion, but I will warn you that you'll see a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense
[01:58:05] <manicennui> That's fine.
[01:58:06] <quanticle> Because Evangelion is highly referential to other animes
[01:58:14] <quanticle> So it's a bit like reading Joyce
[01:58:16] <companion_cube> gurrreennn lagannnnnnnnnn
[01:58:53] <quanticle> Where it's like, "Why is he doing things this way," and the answer to that is "Because it's a reference to these other texts, and he's calling out specific tropes"
[02:00:00] <quanticle> The other thing with Evangelion that a lot of Western viewers get hung up on is the references to Christianity. They're meaningless. They're not deep allegory for anything. Anno literally used those names because they sounded cool. Just like how here people will occasionally invoke Eastern gods because they sound cool.
[02:00:46] <quanticle> He's said this repeatedly in interviews, and I still reviews of Evangelion that try to read Christian allegory into it

[02:03:15] <manicennui> And the audio is English by default, but to switch it to Japanese, I have to be able to read Japanese, because all of the language names are in their native script.
[02:03:29] <manicennui> And there are at least two that look like they could be Japanese.
[02:03:44] <manicennui> Make that three.

[02:42:44] <companion_cube> (and one of the movies, but not to the end, it went too zany for me)
[02:43:22] <quanticle> Okay, the thing with the shows is that their animation quality starts out just as high as the movies... but by the end, you can tell that GAINAX was running out of money, lol

[03:07:10] <jjuran> We had a little power blip over here
[03:08:08] <quanticle> To reiterate: what a jerk
[03:08:28] <quanticle> Dude started fires *behind* first responders responding to the Dixie Fire in California
[03:11:11] <companion_cube> wow
[03:11:20] <companion_cube> so, a murderer
[03:12:06] <jjuran> Well, attempted murderer at least
[03:12:28] <companion_cube> yes, exactly
[03:13:19] <quanticle> Yeah, fortunately someone spotted him and the he was put under surveillance, and he was arrested after the authorities followed him to a few places and noted, "Hmmm, right after this dude leaves a spot, there's a smoke and we have to put out a fire"
[03:14:13] <jjuran> This was an appropriate use of tracking someone's movements through his cell phone
[03:15:24] <manicennui> This show is so much more sophisticated than one would expect.
[03:15:28] <manicennui> movie
[03:17:51] <companion_cube> jjuran: yes, with a warrant, too
[03:19:16] <jjuran> yup
[03:32:55] <Church> Yeah watching the last Eva movie tomorrow with friends
[03:33:04] <Church> Have to binge the first three with the missus
[03:45:09] <manicennui> Evangelion 1.11 was really good.
[03:45:49] <manicennui> Some of the character dialogue was a bit questionable.
[03:46:07] <manicennui> Animation is outstanding, especially when they are showing mechanical stuff.
[03:46:31] <manicennui> They did a good job of keeping the tension high even though you assume they are going to "win".
[03:47:33] <manicennui> I can't see Hollywood making a movie like this, even if it weren't animated.
[03:48:00] <manicennui> That's what I never liked about Pacific Rim.
[03:48:24] <manicennui> Everything was formulaic, I didn't care about the characters, and you knew what was going to happen.
[03:48:28] <manicennui> Complete with cliche moments.

[09:27:19] <quanticle> Eh, 1.11 is good, but I'll be honest: the movies get progressively higher on their own farts as time goes on
[09:27:26] <quanticle> But the soundtrack gets better
[09:27:39] <quanticle> 3.33 had *such* a rad bgm
[09:28:13] <manicennui> I finished 3.33. It was... confusing.
[09:28:23] <manicennui> I mean they are all somewhat confusing, but I really enjoyed the first two.
[09:28:41] <quanticle> Yeah, because it's so self referential that I'm not even sure that Anno knew what he was doing any more
[09:29:17] <manicennui> I watched a YT video explaining the lore, which relied on the movies, the TV series, the manga, video games, and other sources...
[09:29:41] <manicennui> I don't know how I was supposed to understand the whole Adam and Lilith thing from the movies.
[09:30:10] <manicennui> Still not entirely clear on everything, but I guess I understand a bit more.
[09:30:15] <manicennui> I almost liked not knowing.
[09:30:19] <quanticle> You're not. It's explained in the TV shows and the background materials
[09:30:24] <manicennui> But the third movie was too baffling.
[09:30:54] <manicennui> Speaking of baffling: https://www.vice.com/en/article/epn8j4/antivax-semen-fertility-covid-vaccine-safe
[09:30:56] <buttsbot> Antivaxers Think Their ‘Pure’ Semen Will Skyrocket in Value
[09:31:38] <manicennui> "Sperm banks across the country report that because of COVID-19 lockdown measures in the last year and a half, they've seen donor numbers plummet."
[09:32:17] <manicennui> I assume they have very large frozen supplies.
[09:32:45] <quanticle> Incredible
[09:33:34] <manicennui> This information feeds into their fantasies though.
[09:36:39] <quanticle> Well, the other thing about Evangelion is that there are real sacrifices made

[09:42:12] <buttsbot> Amazon Lockers are popping up in the middle of Chicago parks. This one is in a 39th ward playground. : chicago
[09:42:18] <manicennui> ...
[09:44:35] <quanticle> Seems... okay?
[09:44:40] <quanticle> Like, what's the problem here?
[09:45:12] <manicennui> Why would anyone want this shit in a park?
[09:45:20] <manicennui> It's not as though there is a ton of green space in cities.
[09:45:22] <quanticle> Why wouldn't I?
[09:45:33] <quanticle> Like, I get the hate for Amazon, but this seems fine
[09:45:38] <manicennui> Because parks are generally the place to get away from the bullshit.
[09:45:47] <manicennui> I don't even care that its Amazon.
[09:45:52] <manicennui> I don't want commercial shit in parks.
[09:46:07] <quanticle> What about this is bullshit? It's literally just a dropbox where people can go to pick up shit that they ordered online
[09:46:26] <quanticle> Parks already have like vending machines and shit
[09:47:04] <manicennui> Not in the middle of the sidewalk.
[09:47:24] <manicennui> And vending machines aren't super common in the parks in Chicago, unless they are at some building.
[09:48:13] <manicennui> Parks in Chicago are often the only couple blocks of green space with little or no commerce for a few square miles.
[09:48:29] <quanticle> idk, I'm really having trouble seeing why people hate this beyond, "rabble rabble everything Amazon touches is *shit* rabble rabble"
[09:49:23] <quanticle> Yeah, the could probably move it back a couple feet so that's it's a little more out of the way, but it's fine. It's a public place I can go to get my shit, if I don't want it stolen
[09:49:49] <manicennui> We have train and bus stations all over.
[09:49:51] <manicennui> Put them there.
[09:50:23] <manicennui> Why does every square inch of the planet need to be about commerce?
[09:52:03] <quanticle> It doesn't. But at the same time, pick your battles, dude.
[09:52:23] <quanticle> Like, their fraudulent suppression of unionization votes in Bessemer: real problem
[09:52:25] <quanticle> This? Not so much
[09:52:41] <manicennui> Yeah, this is one people are picking, and because we have overly powerful aldermen, they are winning.
[09:54:10] <manicennui> There are about a thousand places that make far more sense for these in Chicago.
[09:54:45] <manicennui> They'll give up when these things get fucked with.
[09:55:15] <quanticle> Yeah, granted, I do wonder about the logic from Amazon's perspective. Around here, Amazon lockers are in and around convenience stores, usually.
[09:55:24] <quanticle> Not... out all by themselves like that
[09:55:28] <manicennui> We have those too.
[09:55:31] <quanticle> I wonder if there's some weird zoning regulation
[09:55:35] <manicennui> They are already all over.
[09:55:39] <manicennui> This is just another location.
[09:55:47] <bkero> Why should Amazon be allowed and no other company?
[09:55:55] <quanticle> Like, here, gas station convenience stores are literally *not allowed* to display bags of water softener salt outside
[09:56:05] <quanticle> Because some Karen probably thought they were ugly
[09:56:14] <quanticle> I'm sorry, not ugly, "unsightly"
[09:56:51] <manicennui> https://www.amazon.com/findalocker
[09:56:58] <manicennui> My zip code is 60625.
[09:57:00] <quanticle> It's really annoying because now I have to drive down to the hardware store to get softener salt, when before I could just drive down to the gas station.
[09:57:03] <manicennui> You can see that they are all over.
[09:57:15] <manicennui> And we have a fair number of Whole Foods locations in Chicago.
[09:58:40] <manicennui> Third on that list is a really nice park.
[09:59:18] <manicennui> I see that several are in bank branches.
[09:59:34] <manicennui> That seems like a good use of the overly numerous bank branches.
[09:59:55] <quanticle> This locker search is so broken lol
[10:00:00] <quanticle> I type in my zip code
[10:00:10] <quanticle> First three results are all >10 mi away
[10:00:15] <quanticle> Not even close to the correct zip code
[10:00:36] <quanticle> The lockers that *are* in my zip code start from like result #5
[10:02:45] <jjuran> Well, you know, Travelling Salesman is a hard problem!
[10:03:17] <quanticle> Like, how difficult is it to calculate the centroid for the zip code and sort lockers by distance from the centroid? That's not a perfect approach, esp. if someone lives near a zip code boundary, but it's certainly better than what they have now which is essentially a random ordering.
[10:08:05] <jjuran> (I once complained to a Google person that Maps was trying to send me along a route that it knew had heavy traffic and would take longer than an alternative route, and that was his response.)
[10:09:11] <manicennui> I bet they aren't random.
[10:09:30] <manicennui> The first result for me is a Whole Foods location, and the second is a 7/11.
[10:09:33] <jjuran> So either he had no idea WTF Traveling Salesman is, or he was just blowing smoke up my ass.
[10:10:06] <manicennui> I bet they list themselves first, and then the deals they have to get the boxes into various locations include ranking them higher in results.
[10:10:30] <jjuran> Ah, so they're not sorted geographically just like timelines aren't sorted chronologically.
[10:10:45] <jjuran> Fuckers.
[10:15:09] <manicennui> Now my brain is wondering how you even find the center of an irregular shape.
[10:15:33] <manicennui> Draw a rectangle around it and use the center of that?
[10:15:52] <manicennui> That wouldn't work in all cases though.
[10:16:00] <manicennui> Just for things that are somewhat rectangular already.

[10:18:25] <manicennui> That's interesting, but not sure how easy that is to do in software.
[10:19:18] <manicennui> OH.
[10:19:25] <manicennui> That's why quanticle used the term centroid.
[10:21:09] <manicennui> Doesn't seem simple for irregular shapes.
[10:22:01] <quanticle> Yeah, but you don't have to compute it on the fly. Just do it once. Heck, it's probably already done; there's probably a dataset that you can download from the US Postal Service or the US Census Bureau that has them pre-computed.
[10:22:38] <quanticle> https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/gis/esridm/2004/help/usa/census/zip_usa.sdc.htm#:~:text=The%20centroid%20of%20a%205,coordinate%20extremes%20of%20the%20polygon.&text=When%20delivery%20information%20is%20unavailable,will%20show%20the%20geographic%20centroid.

[10:25:39] <manicennui> Anyways, I think there is a method behind their ordering that benefits them.
[10:25:51] <quanticle> Yeah, you're probably right
[10:26:06] <quanticle> The first two locations *are* Whole Foods in my search as well

[17:08:59] <river> i prefer mg in terminal than emacs, idk why
[17:09:11] <river> but i dont even use emacs anymore, i use 'code'
[17:09:45] <pja> I tried switching to both Code & Sublime, but my emacs finger macros are very ingrained at this point.
[17:10:00] <pja> & emacs has lsp support these days, so...
[17:29:39] <cb> i use vim mostly out of habit and because it's the only thing available
[17:29:52] <cb> i know how to use motions but honestly, i don't think it was worth it
[17:30:02] <cb> i'm not any more productive than i was in visual studio
[17:31:30] <cb> typing speed is rarely a factor, and the editing in vim with i.e. its stupid fucking regexp escape rules WHICH ARE THE OPPOSITE OF OTHER EDITORS, it's not faster than just... highlighting it with the mouse
[17:31:37] <cb> (one of the few things i agree with pike on)
[17:32:14] <river> yeah
[17:32:26] <river> this is one thing that's starting to bother me more and more in software
[17:32:32] <river> just the lack of uniformity
[17:32:53] <river> there's just to many shallow differences that impede getting things done
[17:33:01] <cb> honestly it is one of the reasons i bought a mac
[17:33:20] <cb> software tries to be consistent with the platform instead of special unique snowflakes
[17:33:27] <river> yeah mac is good on that stuff, although now that mac has essentially got the linux command line in it you still have a bit of trouble
[17:33:32] <cb> even apple at their most dogshit for brains is more coherent than the x11 parts bin
[17:33:52] <river> it is 10000x worse on linux though
[17:34:38] <cb> sadly i don't think the unix dev environment as shit is it is, is avoidable now unless you do like pure legacy dev (incl windows, lbr, with microsoft's trajectory) or pure apple NSWorld stuff
[17:35:58] <cb> even on the legacy platforms, i'm the guy that works in the posix env
[17:37:20] <ngoldbaum> emacs -nw is best emacs because it’s always installed and works
[17:37:44] <ngoldbaum> unless the sysadmin is a vim user and complains about the size of the emacs package
[17:38:00] <skyl4rk> regex might not be faster than hilighting with the mouse for one or two small changes that you have located, but over multiple screens where you have to scroll to while visually scanning and then find it, I think it is
[17:40:00] <river> yeah its unavoiable and unfixable ;_;
[17:41:46] <skyl4rk> having an advanced search tool using a compact specification language (regex) so I don't have to visually scan IS the fix, well to me at least
[17:43:24] <skyl4rk> would be interesting to have something like programming-language-aware regexes, like match foo, but not just the text foo, but when foo is placed so that with the syntax of the language it is the name of a function
[17:44:07] <skyl4rk> something like regex + ast

[19:56:18] <skyl4rk> are you saying I can group nano and emacs?
[19:59:30] <companion_cube> Go for it :p
[19:59:55] <companion_cube> But it's like grouping c89 and c++20
[20:00:06] <companion_cube> There's some common heritage, but they're very distant
[20:04:55] <skyl4rk> but honestly, I group vi and vim because to me the editor war divide is classically between vim and emacs, vs possibly every thing else which could also be further divided into minimal editors and modern ide:s, for me here it is clear that user-interface wise vi and vim belongs in the same box
[20:05:33] <dcz> there are other differences between vi and vim than arrow support?
[20:06:42] <skyl4rk> I don't have energy for further subdivision of the categories, but sure you could continue and continue until every editor is in its own box
[20:07:49] <skyl4rk> dcz: there are differences afaik vi is not at all as extensible as vim is, and don't quote me on this but I think there might be differences in the regex lang as well
[20:09:04] <dcz> vim doesn't strike me as very extensible :P
[20:09:21] <dcz> it's light years ahead the average editor still
[20:10:41] <dcz> I wish there was a version of vim that hinted at which commands might be useful at the moment
[20:11:19] <dcz> I vaguely recall someone made an editor where commands were not verb-noun but noun-verb, but I don't remember exactly how that helped with discoverability

[23:11:57] <manicennui> It's sad that the most successful Democratic states and cities have to settle for such mediocre or bad politicians.
[23:12:12] <manicennui> NY/NYC and IL/Chicago should have much better.
[23:12:30] <manicennui> Fortunately Pritzker hasn't been terrible.
[23:14:24] <ngoldbaum> j.b.: the ok billionaire politician
[23:14:30] <ngoldbaum> don’t worry he’ll be in jail eventually
[23:14:39] <manicennui> Blago is trying to run again.
[23:15:05] <manicennui> https://www.illinoispolicy.org/rod-blagojevich-sues-so-he-can-again-seek-election/
[23:15:06] <buttsbot> Rod Blagojevich sues so he can again seek election
[23:15:17] <ngoldbaum> as a democrat?
[23:16:11] <manicennui> “I have no plans to run for any particular office,” Blagojevich said. “However, I am not going to rule out any options either. I feel like I was a great governor for the people.”
[23:16:16] <manicennui> No idea.
[23:16:40] <manicennui> I haven't been keeping up with what's going on with the Madigans lately.
[23:16:52] <manicennui> Spent the last several months ignoring politics.
[23:17:58] <manicennui> quanticle: Someone claims the Amazon lockbox in the photo has been vandalized.
[23:18:12] <manicennui> I think the Alderman is also having it removed.
[23:18:41] <manicennui> It's amazing how quickly some things can be taken care of in Chicago.
[23:18:43] <manicennui> But not real problems.
[23:21:57] <manicennui> And then there are the Alderman taking bribes to allow companies to basically kill their constituents.

[23:44:08] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I probably can, but I'm not entirely sure where the panic is
[23:44:29] <manicennui> I don't know why I seem to cause it so often.
[23:44:37] <manicennui> Or maybe I only notice when I do.
[23:44:38] <Brekkjern> Me neither to be honest
[23:44:41] <Brekkjern> Probably :P
[23:44:54] <Brekkjern> I don't see it happen all that often, but it sure does happen
