[16:22:45] <morf> DMT has a rapid onset, intense effects, and a relatively short duration of action. For those reasons, DMT was known as the "business trip" during the 1960s in the United States, as a user could access the full depth of a psychedelic experience in considerably less time than with other substances such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms.
[16:22:50] <morf> hehe business trip 
[16:23:30] *** Joins: Trieste (T@user/pilgrim)
[16:25:12] <morf> In a study conducted from 1990 through 1995, University of New Mexico psychiatrist Rick Strassman found that some volunteers injected with high doses of DMT reported experiences with perceived alien entities. Usually, the reported entities were experienced as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality that the subjects reported visiting while under the influence of DMT.

[19:22:20] <morlog> its a death sentence

[19:24:49] <morlog> first on the list is at risk/homeless youth and men age 50 to 60

[19:28:23] <FreeRangeDillo> I'm still angry about all the promises that were made about setting up 'safe' places with security and hygiene and water, which never materialized 
[19:28:36] <morlog> only opens up once every 10 years or so
[19:28:38] <FreeRangeDillo> safe places to camp
[19:28:53] <FreeRangeDillo> city-sponsored camp sites
[19:28:59] <morlog> they just like to talk about dong stuff here
[19:29:25] <FreeRangeDillo> of course the solution is to get people into housing of some sort, but that's not happening quickly enough
[19:29:36] <morlog> they have to spend money on the problem, there isnt any real way for them to profit, thats why its all talk
[19:30:05] <morlog> at least not in the imediate future
[19:30:17] <morlog> no real longterm outlook
[19:31:11] <morlog> either the government needs to provide a safety net or it needs to make it possible for the people to make their own
[19:32:52] <Panther> They dols the building where I live this year so they could afford to put in new elevators.
[19:32:55] <Panther> sold
[19:33:34] <Panther> The old ones were breaking down all the time, sometimes both at once, and many ppl here are in wheelchairs, etc... so they were screwed.
[19:34:10] <FreeRangeDillo> wow
[19:34:28] <louipc> not all money is equal
[19:34:35] <Panther> If there is ever a fire here, they will have to hope and wait that the firemen can get to them on the 12th, 13th, and 14th floors before they burn.

[19:36:38] <Panther> I carry that one around, since the rim dings on the front reduce its value to like $30-$40.
[19:39:37] <Panther> It's only worth about twice that without them. It's in XF-40 condition, imho, otherwise.
