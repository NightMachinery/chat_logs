[04:54:39] <bn_work> hi, can someone provide their thoughts on the following snippet of CSS flagged by an "online scanner"?  it is claiming it is "suspicious" because it is hidden?  https://quttera.com/detailed_report/hmbradley.com (under Scanned File Analysis)  I am aware of basic CSS whereby one can toggle `display: ` attribute between `none` and ___ to hide show elements dynamically, but is that what this is referring to?
[05:00:04] <bn_work> (or more direct link https://quttera.com/detailed_report/hmbradley.com#myModalPotSuspB2A5621448791B83824FF964EF92A049 for the first file's code snippet)
[05:00:12] <hmw[at]> bn_work: "___" is not a valid CSS property, perhaps it is this. Try the validators: https://validator.w3.org/ (html), and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ (css, although it might report things that aren't really wrong sometimes)
[05:00:35] <hmw[at]> Also, find a better tool to check your code. Something that perhaps tells you, what is actually wrong :)
[05:01:26] <bn_work> hmw[at]: but why would it claim it's "hidden"?
[05:01:57] <hmw[at]> That page might be just stupid. Or you really tried to assign "___" which might be considered malicious
[05:03:10] <hmw[at]> bn_work: What for are you using this eval page specifically? I might know some alternatives
[05:05:20] <bn_work> It is one ~85 virus / malware scanners referenced by virustotal.com, and the only one that seemed to think the site was suspicious, so I was trying to understand why, ie:  if it was a false positive or if there really was something nefarious about it
[05:07:06] <hmw[at]> bn_work: Is it your page or just some page you had them scan?
[05:07:23] <bn_work> it is not my page
[05:07:27] <hmw[at]> Ah
[05:08:43] <hmw[at]> I can only guess; Perhaps some people try weird things with invalid css, and that's what is shown. It can also be a false positive.
[05:09:08] <Rockwood> o/
[05:09:17] <hmw[at]> \o
[05:10:34] <bn_work> hmm, yeah, it's not even validating over at the w3 validator.
[05:10:46] <bn_work> I just want to make sure it's _not_ malicious
[05:11:26] <bn_work> is that snippet it provides in the modal incomplete?
[05:12:06] <hmw[at]> Check out that YT video. It has > 100K views and barely any likes/dislikes and virtually no comments. Smells like a scam.
[05:12:10] <bn_work> `[[<style data-href="/styles.46857288170b8af0f72e.css" data-identity="gatsby-global-css">@charset "UTF-8";` part seems strange to me
[05:14:51] <bn_work> oops, that did my last message go through?
[05:15:08] <bn_work> > `[[<style data-href="/styles.46857288170b8af0f72e.css" data-identity="gatsby-global-css">@charset "UTF-8";` part seems strange to me
[05:15:35] <hmw[at]> bn_work: it came through. Where are you seeing it?
[05:15:37] <bn_work> (oh, I think he quote was an IRC reserved char for QUOTE perhaps)
[05:15:54] <bn_work> hmw[at]: that is the first part of the snippet
[05:16:09] <bn_work> https://quttera.com/detailed_report/hmbradley.com#myModalPotSuspB2A5621448791B83824FF964EF92A049

[05:19:21] <bn_work> right
[05:19:27] <hmw[at]> "potentially suspicious" rofl
[05:21:53] <bn_work> apologies if this was a dumb question, I did CSS a long time ago (unfortunately not up to the more advanced less, SASS, and SCSS levels though), but looking at the above, it's just setting styles (I think?), so I don't understand how CSS can become malicious?  unless it hides fields that dumb autofilling browsers may be tricked into filling?

[05:26:35] <bn_work> that data-href part I quoted above is a technique I'm not familiar with, is that like an #include or so?
[05:27:09] <hmw[at]> it includes binary data bas64 encoded. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs
[05:27:11] <bn_work> and this snippet just overrides anything that defines as a base?
[05:27:42] <hmw[at]> It is often used for small icons. Using a data uri saves you a network round trip, which can improve overall performance.
[05:27:49] <bn_work> oh lovely, CSS can now include binary blobs? :/
[05:28:03] <bn_work> gotcha
[05:28:09] <hmw[at]> Yeah. I don't know about any security problems with it, though
[05:28:28] <hmw[at]> Heh

[10:50:49] <fweht> i always forget how stacking contexts work...  can i somehow have a div in front of its content?  meaning the div has a gradient with transparency and the gradient appears above the text inside the div?
[10:53:45] <FunkyBob> i doubt it... perhaps you need a filter?
[10:53:49] <hmw[at]> fweht: Normally not. You can use position with z-index though. (Try position:relative and/or read up on it)
[10:53:52] <thykka> fweht, you may think of it as envelopes; you can put envelopes inside or beside other envelopes, but an envelope that's inside another one, cannot be next to an envelope that isn't within the same level
[10:54:05] <FunkyBob> or overlay a ::before
[10:54:46] <fweht> thykka: yes, thats what i thought, thanks!  overlay ::before definitely works, its just that i want to animate the height and animating two elements at the same time sometimes doesnt work perfectly

[10:56:49] <fweht> hmw[at]: sweet!!
[10:57:59] <hmw[at]> fweht: You have to set the parent element to position other than 'static' (which is the default) to "contain" sizes like % (make the % relate to that parent)

[11:13:44] <hmw[at]> "Best viewed with X" rofl.
[11:18:49] <fweht> i just learned that outline doesnt change width/height of an element, which is mega nice imo, any downsides of using outline instead of border?
[11:19:19] <thykka> fweht, outline is used for focus indicators, so you'll lose that if you use it for something else
[11:19:33] <fweht> hmm ok, good to know!
[11:19:47] <hmw[at]> fweht: Check out box-sizing
[11:19:55] <thykka> ^
[11:19:59] <hmw[at]> fweht: The outline might overlap with other stuff
[11:20:09] <hmw[at]> (being drawn over something you perhaps don't want)
[11:20:55] <hmw[at]> outline is used to indicate the currently focussed element. You might damage usability, if you use it unwisely
[11:20:58] <fweht> ah cool, yeah box-sizing makes sense
[11:22:04] <hmw[at]> evil reset:  * { margin:0; padding:0; box-sizing:border-box; }
[11:22:46] <hmw[at]> I need content-box perhaps in 5% of the time
[11:23:22] <thykka> better: * { box-sizing: inherit; } :root { box-sizing: border-box; }
[11:23:38] <hmw[at]> (that evil reset might have negative effects, if you use external css)
[11:23:47] <thykka> this way you can opt to use content-box, without resetting every element individually
[11:23:53] <hmw[at]> thykka: How is it better?
[11:24:14] <hmw[at]> ah
[11:24:24] <hmw[at]> because I can cascade the value down the tree
[11:24:30] <thykka> yes
[11:24:52] <thykka> that is, if you ever even need content-box..
[11:25:05] <hmw[at]> Not sure, if I would want this as a default. I think, I will more often than not re-assign border-box on the children
[11:25:29] <thykka> it makes the default softer :)
[11:25:39] <hmw[at]> sure, I see how it makes sense
[11:25:43] <thykka> easier to override at a component level
[11:26:08] <fweht> https://jsfiddle.net/1udx4gbp/13/ but box-sizing border still doesnt do what i want
[11:26:48] <thykka> what is the aim here?
[11:26:49] <fweht> only with outline i can calculate the height of the lines from the line-height (without having to add pixels for the border)
[11:27:09] <hmw[at]> omg line height
[11:27:15] <thykka> wait what
[11:27:23] <hmw[at]> Beware, there is a 1px difference between Chrome and FF
[11:27:32] <fweht> ah ok!
[11:27:40] <hmw[at]> I hate basing my layout on line height, especially, if I need pixel perfect positioning
[11:27:57] <fweht> hmw[at]: okok i will think of something different then!
[11:28:05] <thykka> changing the font might ruin your line-height -based design
[11:28:24] <hmw[at]> fweht: Maybe a grid is for you in this case
[11:29:03] <hmw[at]> But I suck at using flex. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
[11:29:10] <thykka> btw, the property value is "border-box", not "border"

[11:33:45] <fweht> the thing i liked about line-height is that using border and line-height always vertically centers the text in the border, alternatively i have to use flexbox but that might be a better solution anyway!

[11:39:01] <hmw[at]> but I had to work hard on it
[11:40:37] <hmw[at]> It still is easy to break this layout/ui framework, when adding elements to a tool bar for example. Hah. Just found a 1px error in it

[11:54:54] <hmw[at]> Seriously considering uploading bitmaps instead of html/css
[11:57:10] <fweht> hmm ok
[11:57:30] <fweht> but my layout seems to work really well, even pixel perfect
[11:58:01] <fweht> i have 'buttons' which are just divs with a border where i set line-height instead of height to keep the text centered
[11:59:19] <hmw[at]> It depends on how crazy you go with nesting. Sometimes line height works just fine
[12:00:33] <hmw[at]> This was my 3rd attempt at making a deskop ui in a web page. The problems always arise with control elements in those tool bars. Guess I will have to use appearance:none; and roll my own custom controls
[12:00:47] <fweht> https://jsfiddle.net/L908mu73/1/
[12:00:56] <fweht> this is my thing without animation
[12:01:08] <fweht> (because the animation part is react, dont know how to share that in jsfiddle)
[12:01:30] <hmw[at]> you can add all kinds of frameworks on the left of the page
[12:01:54] <hmw[at]> just don't ask me about anything not vanilla html/css
[12:02:02] <fweht> ah cool, but is the js part then automatically my app.js
[12:02:20] <hmw[at]> No clue. I guess it will be rather simple
[12:03:02] <fweht> but anyway, the react part has nothing to do with line-height, line-height just controls the button height here
[12:04:33] <fweht> btw your os ui looks really sicks
[12:04:35] <hmw[at]> I wouldn't bother trying to get my stuff working based on line height only, if it weren't about the challenge. It's nicer if everything sizes itself according to content
[12:04:42] <fweht> mustve been lots of work
[12:04:47] <hmw[at]> Not so much actually
[12:04:56] <hmw[at]> a few days of tinkering max
[12:05:10] <fweht> ok, but still like it :)
[12:05:35] <hmw[at]> I am happy how it turned out, too. This one is acutally usable, compared to the hacks I used in the attempts before
[12:06:41] <hmw[at]> Also very proud, that I did not use a single wrapper div
[12:08:03] <fweht> ok, so you try to keep a minimum number of divs for the layout?
[12:09:21] <fweht> my boss likes to use tons of wrapper divs, i always try to keep div count minimal
[12:09:56] <hmw[at]> So it's this. I no longer work professionally in web design, I code web stuffs for fun only now. So I use paradigms, that I could not recommend. That being said, though,
[12:10:27] <hmw[at]> you should really always try to minimize the number of elements in your page, also keep your CSS as small as possible. Each day, "distill" your code (remove as much as possible)
[12:10:35] <hmw[at]> There is a thing called
[12:10:38] <hmw[at]> `divitis
[12:10:38] <Selvvir> hmw[at], Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
[12:11:03] <hmw[at]> `positionitis
[12:11:34] <hmw[at]> okay the bot doesnÃ„t know that one. If you find yourself adding position rules, fighting the browser, you have taken a wrong turn before
[12:11:56] <fweht> makes sense
[12:11:58] <hmw[at]> If you're not very good with CSS, it is a good idea to try to avoid position at all
[12:12:26] <hmw[at]> nested positionings, then adding translate and negative margins and all the tricks can make it really hard to stay on top of things
[12:12:43] <fweht> haha i have negative margins in this thing i just built
[12:12:44] <hmw[at]> Distill your code on a regular basis.
[12:12:48] <fweht> for the animation only
[12:12:56] <fweht> i try to avoide translate
[12:13:16] <hmw[at]> Nothing wrong with position and negative margins, but if you find yourself fighting to keep your layout straight, then you are likely suffering from a positionitis
[12:14:51] <hmw[at]> btw. You get 2 wrappers for free: <html> and <body>
[12:15:13] <hmw[at]> less code also means faster page load, faster rendering and thus longer battery life
[12:16:12] <hmw[at]> but it sounds like you are doing it like I also do it; Let things just fall in place
[12:16:32] <hmw[at]> CSS _is_ hard

[14:24:33] <fweht> :D
[14:25:23] <hmw[at]> Perhaps you want to try having the gradient not going all the way to black, to make it more like a "real" shaded object
[14:26:08] <hmw[at]> also, a bit more padding at the very top and bottom to make it all symmetrical
[14:27:18] <fweht> yeah, ill do some finetuning definitely
[14:28:15] <hmw[at]> omg. That is at least 10x the amount of code, I would have needed
[14:28:28] <hmw[at]> this some framework?
[14:28:45] <hmw[at]> ah, react
[14:30:04] <hmw[at]> Is all that code part of something like jsfiddle?
[14:30:36] <thykka> there's a sandbox link at the bottom
[14:31:11] <hmw[at]> ah right
[14:31:37] <hmw[at]> React makes my cat sad
[14:39:44] <fweht> :(
[14:42:06] <thykka> it's the right answer for the wrong question
[14:43:23] <thykka> the question being "how can I make website development feel more like application development?"
[14:44:19] <thykka> but the twist is, websites should never have been applications in the first place. It's stupid from the ground-up
[14:44:53] <thykka> ignoring that, react can seem like a smart framework to use
[14:47:30] <fweht> i think its fun, jsx seems more consistent than html (all tags must be closed, i can never remember which tags need to close in html and which not)
[14:55:47] <hmw[at]> heheh
[14:56:21] <hmw[at]> Except for some tags in head (<link>) you should not be using any of the tags that have no closing (<br>) anyways

[15:05:08] <hmw[at]> agreed
[15:05:15] <thykka> hr is something that should be screen-readable, because it's not just a visual line, but a thematic break
[15:05:39] <hmw[at]> thykka: hr is often abused by people not very invested in semantic markup
[15:06:05] <thykka> right. evidence of wrong usage should not be reason to avoid right usage
[15:06:27] <hmw[at]> I use a .nocss class { display:none; } and add extra "formatting thigns" like <hr> so the page looks better in a text browser like lynx

[15:09:48] <hmw[at]> (I use a script blocker. So many pages just don't work at all without JS)
[15:09:54] <hmw[at]> (for no real reason)
[15:10:07] <hmw[at]> web apps are cancer and have killed the www
[15:10:26] <hmw[at]> Who in here is old enough to know what "surfing the web" actually meant
[15:11:21] <fweht> you can do static rendering on web apps like reactjs, i think if i would use reactjs only for rendering and not for additional logic, a statically rendered page would appear fine without any javascript
[15:12:49] <thykka> static rendering is nice for content that doesn't change that often
[15:13:05] <DPA> My webpage has <noscript><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=?type=noscript"/></noscript> in it's head. That makes it reload with the pre-rendered static version.
[15:13:09] <hmw[at]> i.e. proper web pages as opposed to web apps

[15:14:21] <thykka> not necessarily a webapp per se, but it would be problematic if availability doesn't update close to real-time
[15:14:30] <thykka> f5 won't help, if it's a static site
[15:14:44] <thykka> it needs to be rebuilt when the content changes
[15:14:46] <hmw[at]> it would be rendered server side in PHP or something. Not fully serious though.
[15:14:48] <fweht> thykka: yes, thats true
[15:15:16] <thykka> modern static site renderers can render only partial changes though
[15:15:31] <hmw[at]> My aproach is to do a REST interface based page first, and then add JS to make it dynamic and use ajax etc
[15:16:27] <hmw[at]> Probably not as efficient for bandwidth etc
[15:16:53] <hmw[at]> *clicks wikipedia and starts _surfing_ something*
[15:16:58] <thykka> my approach is, CMS is connected to website repo with a webhook, that triggers partial re-rendering when product data changes
[15:17:49] <hmw[at]> How I do my stuff doesn't really matter, Racecar Johnny has scripting enabled anyways
[15:17:57] <hmw[at]> But you could easily combine both methods
[15:18:00] <thykka> there could also be hybrid routes, where some pages are static and others are SSR
[15:18:06] <hmw[at]> (Boss won't pay for it though)
[15:18:31] <DPA> That's kind of how my current webpage works (REST with noscript fallback): https://danielabrecht.ch/ I never got to put anything on there, though. But it got a conami code easter egg.
[15:18:39] <DPA> *konami
[15:19:30] <hmw[at]> DPA: Suggestion (an idea I had for my page a few days ago): Start a web catalog and show the big search engine the middle finger
[15:20:01] <hmw[at]> DPA: Your page stays blank without JS (black)
[15:20:13] <DPA> Not in my browsers.
[15:20:15] <hmw[at]> aaw nice image
[15:20:45] <hmw[at]> FF, uMatrix, uBlock
[15:21:07] <DPA> That probably disables the meta redirect.
[15:21:15] <DPA> Your browser is broken.
[15:21:16] <hmw[at]> no, it disables <noscript>.
[15:21:58] <DPA> Disabling both <script> and <noscript> is just a browser being broken. I can't work around that.
[15:22:18] <hmw[at]> I stopped using it, because script blockers do weird thigns with it. Some change it into a <span> for example and other idiotic things. Now I do <div class="noscript">Please enable JS</div><script>document.querySelector .noscript .parentNide.removeChild
[15:22:43] <hmw[at]> DPA: Some script blockers mess with the <noscript> tag
[15:22:51] <hmw[at]> for whatever reason
[15:23:15] <DPA> I can't redirect if there is no js without noscript.
[15:23:26] <DPA> It's just not possible.
[15:23:28] <hmw[at]> yeah
[15:24:19] <hmw[at]> If you wanted a working solution for these users, you can make a full screen overlay with a hyperlink to the no-script version, and the JS of the actual main page just removes it on boot

[22:53:54] <ecraven> hello ;) is there any way to tell the browser that it should make the text size the largest it can so that the given content doesn't overflow its parent? I have a DIV with a fixed width, which just contains plain text, no nested elements.
[22:55:12] <hmw[at]> ecraven: not with css afaik, you'd need to use JS to prerender and do a bit of calculations manually
[22:55:51] <hmw[at]> (I understood it so: You have x amount of text and want it zoomed so it fills the viewport)
[22:58:27] <ecraven> yes, I'm playing around with a simple flashcards app, and would like to show the flashcard face text as large as possible, but without overflow ;)
[22:58:45] <ecraven> thanks, I'll look at javascript solutions then.. or maybe SVG might work, I found something about that (auto-scaling the viewport)
[22:59:05] <ecraven> though then I'd have to calculate a correct viewport size, leading to the same problem ;)
[22:59:08] <ecraven> so, javascript it is
[22:59:55] <hmw[at]> measureText()

[23:02:21] <jplejacq> Responsive font dimensions should be usable. vw, vh, and similar
[23:03:42] <StickyIcky2> Hey everyone, I'm looking into someone elses' SASS code and I can't find where a variable is set, all I can see is where it's used. The browser is setting them, since I can inspect the code on the browser and see a value assigned, but I don't know where it's declared. Global search does not reveal anything and I don't know much about SASS, does anyone know where I could look? This is a React project.
[23:04:05] <hmw[at]> jplejacq: but you don't know how much text there is
[23:04:38] <hd1> anyone have a clue as to why the footer on https://hd1-uber.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in doesn't appear below the text?
[23:04:42] <jplejacq> CSS can handle this. You just need to specify the wrapping you want.
[23:04:52] <hmw[at]> StickyIcky2: Use grep (a Linux terminal tool. I think WIndows should have it too) and do a full text search over the source dir
[23:05:20] <hmw[at]> jplejacq: Interesting. What CSS rules I should look into?
[23:06:00] <hd1> WSL will get you grep
[23:07:01] <jplejacq> @hvw[at], search for Responsive Typography. Lot's of info on this topic. Here's a really simple demo - https://codyhouse.co/nuggets/responsive-typography
[23:07:08] <hmw[at]> thanks
[23:07:18] <hd1> or you can do so in emacs for windows using C-M-s
[23:07:26] <StickyIcky2> hvw: That did it, thanks!
[23:09:06] <hmw[at]> jplejacq: those examples are not agnostic about text length tho, if I see it right
[23:10:12] <hmw[at]> I'll look into it tomorrow. Already tired.
[23:11:00] <jplejacq> @hmw[at], I assume you will use whatever CSS layout mechanism you'd like. vw, vh and clamp() sit on top of that.
[23:11:18] <hmw[at]> But that works only, when I know how many letters there are
[23:15:45] <jplejacq> I'm not sure I understand. The problem was "make the text size the largest it can so that the given content doesn't overflow its parent". Do you mean you don't want text wrapping?
[23:15:45] *** Rockwood_ is now known as Rockwood
[23:17:04] <hmw[at]> The text should be enlarged so that the whole viewport is optimally filled to the max without overflow
[23:18:10] <hmw[at]> I wouldn't do that, ecr'aven asked for that
[23:18:33] <hmw[at]> and I got curious as to how I would do it. I guess doing it manually in JS isn't soo trivial
[23:18:49] <jplejacq> And the height is fixed as well?
[23:19:05] <hmw[at]> size of viewport/container is given, and a string to print
[23:19:21] <hmw[at]> task: calculate the correct font size.
[23:19:41] <hmw[at]> (or use some new CSS thing I don't yet know about)
[23:20:28] <hmw[at]> number of lines is also to be calculated
[23:20:39] <hmw[at]> or taken into account at least
[23:21:34] <jplejacq> OK. I'm not sure CSS can do this. You would need to know a lot of details that the browser, things like kerning.
[23:21:58] <hmw[at]> right. I have not heard of any such CSS property
[23:22:40] <hmw[at]> It would also be not very user friendly to blast 2m large letters into the user's face :)
[23:22:56] <jplejacq> Indeed!
[23:24:14] <hmw[at]> I had to do something similar for a score sheet thingy, I made with Unicode note glyphs
[23:24:25] <hmw[at]> Performance wasn't exactly stellar
