[00:25:58] <manicennui> Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band guitarist Nils Lofgren is the latest musician to pull songs from Spotify to protest the streaming service carrying comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast.
[00:26:42] <manicennui> Ek said the company plans to add a content advisory on any podcast episode that mentions Covid-19. It will direct listeners to a hub of information from public health experts, scientists and physicians, he said. He also published the platform’s rules.
[00:29:42] <wrl> ek is one of the least likable people i think i've ever seen
[00:29:54] <wrl> dude's worth like €100 million and has the nerve to dictate how musicians should be operating
[00:32:15] <manicennui> wrl: That's pretty much all executives in the music business.
[00:32:24] <manicennui> And every creative pursuit.
[00:32:40] <manicennui> People with capital dictate how the people who are creative operate, and take most of the profit.

[07:34:32] <imode> just as bad.
[07:34:44] <manicennui> He also recently tweeted that he was in support of vaccinations. “I am triple vaccinated (Pfizer),” he wrote.
[07:34:47] <imode> “I may not agree with everything Joe Rogan or his guests say, but they’re entitled to have the forum to say it,” they really aren't.
[07:35:22] <imode> just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you can't spew or support anti-vax rhetoric and propaganda.
[07:35:39] <imode> case in point... trump.
[07:36:10] <manicennui> Yeah, but Trump does it for a very specific reason.
[07:36:18] <manicennui> He doesn't generally care about the actual positions.
[07:36:23] <manicennui> He just cares about what helps him.
[07:38:43] <manicennui> He just isn't smart enough to realize that handling the pandemic well might have been enough to win him the election, and keeping his cult alive might be useful.
[07:41:07] <companion_cube> if he had made MAGA masks, he'd be actually rich, *and* reelected
[07:41:09] <companion_cube> what an idiot
[07:43:29] <manicennui> Could have had his kids setup vaccination clinics and get paid by the government to vaccinate people.

[07:44:41] <companion_cube> yeah there's so many ways to skin that cat
[07:45:00] <companion_cube> but it was too late, I suppose, he'd already been seeding doubts about the vaccines for months
[07:45:08] <manicennui> I notice we haven't heard anything more about his social network.

[08:17:21] <companion_cube> hmmm I've barely been out, to be frank
[08:17:26] <companion_cube> I moved there in march 2020 😂
[08:17:34] <manicennui> Good timing.
[08:17:45] <companion_cube> I don't think I have advice better than any tourist book
[08:18:06] <companion_cube> (although, you might be able to see some cherry blossoms? if you're lucky with timing)

[08:19:49] <indigo> Yes! I believe that this is prime cherry blossom season
[08:19:56] <indigo> Sadly the white house and capitol tours are not available
[08:20:09] <manicennui> I've heard the Smithsonian is worth visiting.
[08:20:13] <indigo> But I think the museums are open again (except for the air and space museum)

[08:20:20] <companion_cube> if the the cherry blossom is on, go to the tidal basin
[08:20:24] <companion_cube> (it'll be crowded)
[08:20:34] <indigo> Also I think dminkovsky is close too
[08:20:36] <companion_cube> the air and space museum is _partly_ open, at least the part in virginia

[14:31:03] <edk> eh, people have opinions
[14:31:31] <Brekkjern> Opinions, sure, but this just a list of programs sorted in two collumns.
[14:31:40] <Brekkjern> I'd like to hear the explanation :P
[14:31:43] <edk> it's amusing that this specific person thinks anyone else should care about theirs, but at least they've put them all in one place
[14:31:45] <edk> why?
[14:31:56] <Brekkjern> I misspoke. I don't actually want to know.
[14:32:14] <Brekkjern> I'm just saying it would be nice if they actually put the reasoning on the page so we could mock them for it.
[14:39:02] <riv> to be fair, utf-16 and utf-32 are harmful
[14:54:04] <mgdm> it's cool that they've told us little endian is harmful, that's something I can absolutely fix right now by switching all of my systems to big endian
[15:02:13] <gerikson> author is both ``Strong proponent of copyleft licences'' *and* ``Linux-hater, systemd-hater'' *and* ``Unix-way, DJB-way and suckless philosophy follower''
[15:04:11] <edk> oh goody, are we going to have yet another conversation where we decide anyone pro-copyleft must be a nazi by association
[15:06:32] <riv> UTC	TAI64 <- this is true as well
[15:06:45] <riv> at least in some situations
[15:07:34] <riv> https://hjson.github.io/ looks extremely harmful, disagree on this one
[15:07:35] <buttsbot> Hjson, a user interface for JSON
[15:08:02] <riv> it would be nice if JSON allowed trailing commas but it doesn't so we just have to deal with it
[15:08:39] <edk> UTC and TAI would be comparable
[15:08:41] <riv> making a new std up is not really a solution. you could wish for js and json to both simultaneously add support for trailing commas
[15:08:45] <edk> UTC and TAI64 aren't
[15:09:03] <edk> i dunno
[15:09:13] <edk> i think the right solution is to stop using json and use a new standard
[15:09:22] <epilys> json++
[15:09:30] <edk> it's inadequate and always has been
[15:09:41] <riv> ah i just rad what the 64 means
[15:10:33] <riv> json is nice because it's a javascript subset - other formats don't do that. except s-expressions which could be good
[15:10:52] <edk> what good properties does that give it though
[15:11:05] <edk> i don't need to evaluate my config files as javascript
[15:11:13] <riv> you can easily write it in a javascript file, or print it out from javascript
[15:11:22] <edk> even in contexts where one is already using javascript, using eval to deserialise json is mega frowned upon
[15:11:31] <riv> yes you definitely would not parse it using eval
[15:11:31] <edk> but i don't use javascript at all
[15:11:42] <edk> then why is it relevant that it's a subset of js
[15:15:00] <edk> i think my favourite thing here is glibc	musl
[15:15:16] <riv> yeah?
[15:17:48] <edk> so musl has at least one "feature" that makes it completely useless for some applications: its dlclose doesn't do anything
[15:17:59] <riv> oh
[15:18:36] <riv> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22693015 reading this
[15:18:36] <buttsbot> That musl refuses to implement dlclose() says it all, really. Musl's sin isn't a... | Hacker News
[15:18:40] <edk> this is justified because sometimes dlclose can leak resources or not work as expected
[15:18:48] <edk> so instead they've made it... always leak resources...
[15:19:53] <riv> which programs does this have a really bad impact on?
[15:20:11] <edk> the ircd we're using now is completely dependent on it for example
[15:20:37] <riv> ah that is a shame
[15:20:44] <riv> (that it can't be used with musl)
[15:20:57] <edk> anyway, i think you could summarize this position as making broken code slightly less broken while breaking code that was not broken
[15:21:05] <edk> feels very reminiscent of openbsd and srandom
[15:21:41] <edk> these are the opinions of someone who does not want computers to be useful
[15:21:57] <edk> or at least doesn't consider them to exist as part of the real world
[15:23:10] <gerikson> edk: not saying this perons is a nazi
[15:23:19] <gerikson> Russian nationalist, certainly
[15:23:56] <riv> "Mein Konfig"
[15:24:01] <riv> what did they mean by this
[15:24:17] <gerikson> <chin-stroking emoji>
[15:25:21] <edk> maybe this person is, i'm just grumpy because i feel like copyleft has become taboo around here
[15:25:29] <riv> what does the ircd use dlopen/dlclose for?
[15:25:35] <riv> I would guess something to do with chanserv?
[15:26:03] <edk> it has loadable modules
[15:26:22] <riv> and I guess it's important ot be able to remove them without rebooting
[15:26:41] <edk> yes
[15:27:19] <gerikson> copyleft has some shitty advocates edk
[15:27:25] <edk> yes
[15:27:26] <gerikson> but then so does permissive
[15:27:30] <edk> yes
[15:27:32] <riv> license people are so annoying
[15:27:38] <riv> what the fuck does it matter, the source code is there
[15:29:48] <edk> well it matters to me because i think useful code being copylefted makes it harder for corporations to maintain their power
[15:30:36] <riv> well if you still have hope that we can defeat the megacorps I don't want to shatter that
[15:30:51] <edk> it's not that i have hope, it's that i think one should still try
[15:31:25] <riv> I like that :)
[15:31:27] <edk> nothing annoys me more than sitting in here listening to people talk about how the megacorps have already won so there's no need to even try to behave conscientiously any more
[15:31:52] <riv> so what's the dlclose part used for? My guess is it's to reload a new updated version of a module?
[15:41:33] <edk> yes
[16:14:12] <riv> that makes sense
[16:19:07] <wrl> "musl can't remove the functionality provided by the kernel. You're still free to use syscall(3) or otherwise invoke the kernel routine yourself."
[16:19:10] <wrl> lmfao
[16:19:22] <wrl> this is a real post made by a real person
[16:19:28] <riv> lol
[16:19:45] <riv> just dlopen glibc and use its implementation of dlclose
[16:19:47] <riv> problem solved
[16:19:54] <wrl> easy
[16:20:09] <wrl> use an alternative libc so that you can syscall(3) your way out of dumb shit it does
[16:22:41] <riv> it's a shame because I think musl is very very well designed and implemented
[16:22:52] <riv> but this one point about dlopen doesn't really seem to make much sense

[19:42:47] <gwozniak> omfg I found the build problem, and it's related to filesystem timestamps
[19:44:03] <gwozniak> It might be because of "maintainer mode" in the GNU build system

[20:07:03] <gwozniak> It's the mode where you generate Makefiles and configure scripts
[20:12:40] <gwozniak> But the fun part is that those generated files are shipped with the distribution and the Makefiles recognize changes to them

[23:10:59] <gerikson> so pretty clear it was germans who diddit
[23:11:02] <Brekkjern> That cops get shot at in the US is a symptom of one problem, and that cops shoot suspects is a symptom of another set of problems.
[23:13:55] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I meant more non-cops shooting other non-cops.
[23:14:05] <manicennui> Cops literally sign up for the possibility.
[23:14:15] <manicennui> Being a cop in the US is also not in the top 10 most dangerous jobs.
[23:14:41] <Brekkjern> I honestly have no idea how dangerous it is to be a cop in Norway, so...
[23:15:33] <manicennui> It's just an interesting bit of human psychology.
[23:16:02] <manicennui> We also respond far more strongly to a single event with multiple victims than far more victims on an ongoing basis.
[23:16:27] <manicennui> The average weekend in Chicago has more shootings than most of the mass shootings.
[23:17:14] <manicennui> 795 people shot and killed in Chicago last year.
[23:17:26] <manicennui> 3747 shot total.
[23:17:52] <companion_cube> damn, that's almost a half day of covid
[23:18:18] <Brekkjern> There was 29 murder victims in Norway in 2021...
[23:18:53] <manicennui> Norway has right around double the population of Chicago.
[23:18:57] <manicennui> Would be nice if we had numbers that low.
[23:19:08] <Brekkjern> I get that the socioeconomic situations are different, and all that, but holy fucking shit, Chicago is a warzone in comparison.
[23:19:33] <manicennui> Brekkjern: It gets even worse when you focus on a handful of neighborhoods where most of the shootings happen.
[23:20:05] <manicennui> At one point we (someone else on IRC and I) calculated that you were in more danger in some neighborhoods in Chicago than being a soldier in Iraq.
[23:20:26] <manicennui> If you were a young black male in one of those neighborhoods, you were super fucked.
[23:20:32] <manicennui> Very high likelihood of being shot.
[23:20:38] <Brekkjern> Wouldn't surprise me to be honest. The US military complex at least makes a token effort to care for their troops
[23:21:03] <manicennui> We elected a black mayor. I think people hoped that she would care about these things. She doesn.
[23:21:06] <manicennui> doesn't
[23:21:27] <manicennui> I also don't know that the mayor of Chicago can fix the underlying problems.
[23:21:45] <manicennui> But she just continues the crap that we have always done that hasn't worked.
[23:23:18] <Brekkjern> This is the murder statistics for Norway in absolute numbers. Blue is cases, red is victims.

[23:25:26] <Brekkjern> Anders Behring Breivik attacked the Workers Party youth camp on Utøya after detonating a huge bomb in the government quarters in the capitol. Killed 77 people in total. Most at the island.

[23:35:20] <manicennui> Can you swear on the news in Norway?
[23:35:50] <Brekkjern> In what sense? The reporters/news anchors avoid doing it, but I don't think there are laws against it
[23:36:17] <manicennui> I'm trying to gauge Norway's tolerance for profanity in general.
[23:36:37] <manicennui> In the US the FCC fines companies if they allow certain words on broadcast television.
[23:36:37] <Brekkjern> In general we don't give a fuck
[23:36:57] <Brekkjern> I swear like a sailor at work. So do pretty much everyone else
[23:37:16] <manicennui> I ask because there is some school district in North Carolina that just banned a book about MLK, Jr. because it contains profanity.
[23:37:26] <manicennui> One parent complained and they removed it from the curriculum.
[23:37:46] <manicennui> I know that we are idiots about this kind of stuff, but I wasn't sure what attitudes were like in Europe.
[23:37:57] <manicennui> Yeah, I can swear at work, but I don't do it frequently.
[23:38:00] <Brekkjern> A quick google search shows that swearwords are rarely censored on news sites at least
[23:38:22] <manicennui> (The real reason this parent complained was almost certainly racist)
[23:38:54] <Brekkjern> Obviously
[23:39:39] <Brekkjern> The only piece of media that I know was censored in Norway was The Life of Brian, which prompted the Swedish release to put the tagline "So funny it's banned in Norway" on their posters
[23:43:30] <Brekkjern> Swearing is very relaxed here. There is even a supreme court judgement that says that calling a police officer a "horse cock" (which is a rather popular swear in the north) is not sufficient for a fine for insulting (not quite the correct meaning, but it's the closest I get) a police officer.
[23:44:01] <manicennui> I think there are fines for public profanity in many places in the US.
[23:45:11] <gerikson> Norway has come a long way just in my lifetime
[23:45:23] <gerikson> I think the church used to have a lot more sway
[23:45:35] <Brekkjern> It did. Now it has fuck all to say.
[23:45:45] <gerikson> in general .NO culture seems to trail .SE by 20 years or so
[23:45:58] <manicennui> US culture trails by about 100 years.
[23:46:09] <manicennui> In many cases we actively go in the other direction.
[23:46:33] <manicennui> Although gay marriage did come together pretty quickly after the SCOTUS decision.
[23:46:42] <Brekkjern> Eh. Shit goes wrong over here too. We're just not as divided as you guys are yet.
[23:47:14] <Brekkjern> And we have plenty of fucked up shit in our history too. It's just not as well known or not at such a large scale.
[23:47:26] <manicennui> Brekkjern: A big part of our problems are a good chunk of the country trying to continue to oppress black people.
[23:47:39] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:47:43] <manicennui> Ever since we freed the slaves we have passed all kind of laws to make things difficult for them, to this very day.
[23:48:08] <manicennui> Having fucked up history is one thing. Trying to get back to those fucked up times is another.
[23:48:46] <Brekkjern> True
[23:48:46] <manicennui> Being a younger country probably doesn't help.
[23:48:52] <manicennui> A lot of things are pretty recent for us.
[23:50:16] <companion_cube> ironically, the US state is quite old compared to others
[23:50:25] <companion_cube> *germany* didn't even exist when the US were created
[23:50:46] <manicennui> Seems odd that a lot of the better countries are some form of constitutional monarchies.
[23:50:54] <companion_cube> France has changed like 8 times since 1789
[23:50:54] <Brekkjern> The reason is likely that there were little border tension and land tension during the expansion.
[23:50:55] <manicennui> But the monarchs don't have much power.
[23:51:24] <Brekkjern> Why bother having internal fights over things when you can just move a bit over and have just as good land and you don't have to fight anyone for it?
[23:51:32] <manicennui> companion_cube: No, but there were people in that area creating "Western" history for much longer.
[23:51:42] <companion_cube> sure, sure
[23:52:22] <manicennui> The US is also a fundamentally different country from when it was founded.
[23:52:46] <manicennui> The Civil War and then the industrial revolution and WWII changed things greatly.
[23:54:20] <Brekkjern> "Europeans think 100 miles is a long way, Americans think 100 years is a long time"
[23:55:45] <manicennui> It's just sad that people can't see past all the nonsense.
[23:55:58] <companion_cube> Brekkjern: nice one
[23:57:11] <manicennui> I don't think we'll make much progress on major issues in the next 20 years.
[23:57:57] <manicennui> So I gotta find a way to acquire more resources!
[23:58:03] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: that's a good quote :)
[23:58:07] <manicennui> Remove myself from their nonsense.
