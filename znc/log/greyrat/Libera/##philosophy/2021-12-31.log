[00:56:59] <causative_> I know what pleiotropy is, I have a vague understanding of what they mean by the other terms
[00:57:06] <evolv> let's stick with that
[00:57:25] <causative_> they're saying they have identified some genes explaining 10% of human variation in intelligence
[00:57:27] <shea> How is that consistent with what you have said previously? That is, alien life may be preferred (by way of providing more protection, that it "might take many human lives to morally equal one alien life) to that of human life where it would lead "to the greater good overall ... whatever leads to more living minds with more understanding of the universe"; and furthermore, that what we should
[00:57:29] <shea> truly value is truth-seeking (presumably above all else, based on what I can infer from the tenor of your argument). What am I really asking is that: is there a proverbial line in the sand where this "truth-seeking" must give way to human rights, no matter the detriment to this "truth-seeking"? Human experiments, even the most cruel, can lead "to more living minds with more understanding of
[00:57:29] <evolv> gene by gene interactions confound the ability to identify phenotype by genotype
[00:57:31] <shea> the universe". In my mind, if you elect to draw a line, it will be inconsistent with what you have said previously.
[00:58:04] <evolv> also, GWAS is more-or-less nonsense
[00:58:14] <causative_> yeah I know it's a hard problem evolv , I'm saying we should be doing more to try to solve it
[00:58:44] <shea> Let's not get distracted by minutia
[00:58:49] <evolv> statistical analyses with GWAS, in terms of frequentist stats, use a p-value of 5*10^-8

[01:01:54] <causative_> shea, there are no hard lines in the sand
[01:02:08] <evolv> to claim any gens have been identified as contributing any variation of human intelligence is questionable
[01:02:12] <evolv> the science isn't strong enough
[01:02:42] <causative_> if the benefit to society in general is great enough, anything might be justified. But beware the "false positives": the more extreme you think the benefit is going to be, the more likely it is that you are overestimating the benefit
[01:02:57] <causative_> so we should be cautious about drastic actions that we think might lead to benefit
[01:03:37] <shea> You keep saying you're not a utilitarian, but keep reverting to utilitarian analysis. You must either admit as much, or reason from first principles. I do not wish to discuss with your shadow.
[01:03:58] <causative_> I did say that my perspective often coincides with utilitarianism
[01:04:00] <causative_> but not always
[01:04:08] <shea> Well so far I see nothing but
[01:04:22] <causative_> for example, the "utility monster" problem of utilitarianism is not a problem for truth-seeking morality
[01:04:37] <causative_> because simply for one being to experience a lot of pleasure does not help society reach for truth
[01:04:43] <shea> And, insofar as your doctrine is consistent in this manner with utilitarianism, I utterly reject it
[01:04:56] <evolv> and we're back
[01:05:21] <shea> causative_: I don't know what you are saying here
[01:05:27] <evolv> it doesn't matter
[01:05:36] <causative_> evolv, it may be a difficult problem but I have no doubt that there are indeed many genes that lead to greater intelligence, whether we've identified them or not; our genes are what make us human
[01:05:42] <evolv> intelligence is independent from truth-seeking
[01:05:53] <evolv> and IQ is independent from intelligence
[01:05:53] <causative_> so further study could both discover more of them, and select for them in embryos

[01:07:16] <evolv> then there is the issue of determining what truth is
[01:07:19] <causative_> evolv, they're a bit slippery concepts, but they're closely related. intelligence is a good thing, anyway
[01:07:20] <evolv> how truth is determined
[01:07:32] <evolv> what the threshold is for evidence
[01:07:54] <evolv> then assigning weight to the value of truth determined
[01:08:02] <shea> Okay, but I don't understand the broader point that you are making? What you have so far said with regards to "truth-seeking" is entirely consistent with utilitarianism. THat you acknowledge a criticism of such analysis doesn't actually mean anything
[01:08:19] <causative_> I adhere to something I call "persuasionism": truth is what a reasonable person would be persuaded of if he looks at all the possible evidence, in the very long term
[01:08:20] <shea> You acknowledge prefunctorily
[01:08:36] <evolv> define "reasonable person"
[01:08:43] <evolv> and provide evidence
[01:08:44] <causative_> of course, persuasionism is different from how to actually practically determine truth in the short term
[01:09:34] <causative_> we don't know exactly what a "reasonable person" is; we can say generally that a reasonable person is someone who makes effective inferences that tend to be right enough, and that a reasonable person tends to correct flaws in his thinking over time
[01:10:08] <causative_> to be clear a reasonable person is not someone who is logically perfect, but someone capable of noticing his errors and trying to fix them
[01:10:35] <shea> That seems to be an unsatisfactory account of what constitutes truth.
[01:10:58] <shea> Are you satisfied with your own conception/
[01:12:01] <shea> I mean, an immediate observation is that, by that metric, truth isn't necessarily fixed, in the sense that the reasonable person may "correct their error", thereby changing the "truth"
[01:12:02] <causative_> perhaps it's not fully complete, but one thing it does well is that it in principle provides a way to evaluate the truth of *any* proposition; in theory we just start with a "reasonable person" and give him access to the evidence and a lot of time
[01:12:22] <causative_> by this means we can assign truth to even moral propositions, or propositions about consciousness
[01:12:22] <biys> my evidence is the most accurate
[01:12:34] <biys> but you need to re-evaluate a lot of the underpinning you have
[01:12:37] <biys> cause it's just not accurate
[01:12:47] <biys> as a result, there is no way you'd be able to determine the correct truth
[01:12:54] <biys> because your underpinning is faulty
[01:12:55] <causative_> shea, truth isn't what the reasonable person thinks in the moment, it's what they *would* think in the *very long run*

[01:16:08] <causative_> no, evolv , truth doesn't have to be known to correct an error; I may think I saw a dog out my window, then correct myself and realize it moves more like a cat, and it's only later that I realize that it's a ferret

[01:17:42] <shea> What do you make, causative_, of Plato's conception of truth? If I could put it simply, and crudely, that the truth is the essence of all Forms.
[01:17:42] <evolv> I have no idea how you convinced yourself your circular reasoning makes any sense
[01:17:52] <evolv> perhaps you should write all of these things down and draw diagram maps

[01:18:48] <ro-bot-o> [url] reference request - Modeling of persuasion - Philosophy Stack Exchange | philosophy.stackexchange.com
[01:18:50] <shea> And, just to add to evolv's point, I think that the standard of the reasonable person is too low a threshold. As I said previously, by this method you can arrive only at an imitation of truth, or arrive at truth only as an incident and not by design
[01:18:54] <causative_> I'm not sure if you can view that without logging in
[01:20:08] <causative_> but basically it just lays out persuasionism mathematically, making formal the notion of the "limit" of inference
[01:20:25] <causative_> I can paste it somewhere else if it's not visible
[01:20:34] <shea> It is accessible, don't worry
[01:21:58] <shea> At best, it may be a practical solution on how we might arrive at a consensus of truth, but to describe it as a method of arriving at truth itself would be going too far.
[01:22:13] <causative_> it's not a method of arriving at truth, it's a philosophical definition of truth
[01:22:26] <shea> Well then it is not convincing

[01:24:31] <evolv> it's also just a model

[01:26:38] <shea> As that may be, it seems that the existence of such an obvious paradox makes the model unsatisfactory
[01:26:50] <causative_> it's not a paradox unless the reasonable person would actually do that
[01:26:57] <causative_> and I don't think he would, because I think the model is right
[01:27:13] <I_Am_M00t> :)
[01:27:50] <evolv> thinking a model is right is not the same as knowing the model is right
[01:27:53] <I_Am_M00t> i think my model is right
[01:28:07] <I_Am_M00t> in my model, i refute claims by writing smileys
[01:28:09] <causative_> certain knowledge is impossible, all that we have at any moment is an educated guess
[01:28:24] <causative_> when we say we "know" something all we mean is that we're confident in it
[01:28:33] <I_Am_M00t> anyone who disagrees with me is met with a smiley
[01:28:33] <causative_> we could still be wrong about something we say we know
[01:28:35] <evolv> confidence-seeking
[01:28:50] <I_Am_M00t> the smiley defeats everyone else's beliefs
[01:29:35] <evolv> placing value of a human life on confidence in what is true based on a popularity contest should be terrifying
[01:29:58] <causative_> you mentioned a popularity contest before evolv and I told you that's not what persuasionism is about
[01:30:07] <causative_> it's *not* about what anyone thinks in the present
[01:30:09] <Ungwelian> To truly change people is a heck of a long-term effort, where the actual topic of change may play a very small role. And the effort can still fail.
[01:30:19] <evolv> and not to mention the class system causative_ supported based on group intelligence
[01:30:32] <causative_> I didn't support a "class system" based on "group intelligence" wtf
[01:30:48] <evolv> an alien group more intelligence than humans have greater worth, as causative_ said explicitly
[01:31:08] <evolv> and his belief that intelligence is genetic, which easily leads to population-based intelligence differences
[01:31:14] <causative_> oh, well sure, just as a human has more moral worth than a cow
[01:31:21] <causative_> if that's what you call a "class system" then you accept it as well
[01:31:28] <causative_> because you think humans have more moral worth than cows, don't you?
[01:31:32] <I_Am_M00t> へ‿(ツ)‿ㄏ
[01:31:34] <evolv> and worth attributed to intelligence results in a class system within our own species where causative_ has justified killing for the greater good
[01:31:42] <I_Am_M00t> nope causative_, i don't think taht
[01:32:05] <I_Am_M00t> going by moral standards, humans are quite horrible
[01:32:08] <I_Am_M00t> that's what i think
[01:32:09] <causative_> evolv, a class system within our own species would be very detrimental to the search for truth and I do not support it
[01:32:26] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know how it's a given that humans are automatically morally superior to animals へ‿(ツ)‿ㄏ
[01:32:27] <causative_> you would have einsteins working as farmhands, locked their by their class, more than today
[01:32:33] <causative_> *locked there
[01:32:49] <I_Am_M00t> what people actually mean is that humans are more intelligent, not moral
[01:33:06] <causative_> class mobility is important for making use of the talents of *everyone* in society
[01:33:43] <causative_> I_Am_M00t, whether humans are more moral or less moral than a cow, is a different question to whether humans have more moral *worth* than a cow
[01:34:01] <evolv> a cow can't fight back, can't speak
[01:34:08] <causative_> an immoral person's life is still usually worth more than a cow's life, and not because the cow did anything wrong
[01:34:15] <evolv> which is what makes it easier to do whatever we want with them
[01:34:19] <causative_> moral behavior and moral value are different concepts
[01:34:20] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know what any of that means causative_
[01:34:29] <shea> evolv makes a good point broadly, however. The point is that you hold truth-seeking as some sort of moral imperative which justifies valuing "persons" (that being aliens, humans or any other being with sapience) on their capacity to "truth-seek". In this, you argued that we might protect aliens to the detriment of humans (or, as you put it in another way, it might take many human lives to
[01:34:30] <causative_> it means moral behavior and moral value are different concepts, I_Am_M00t
[01:34:30] <shea> morally equal one alien life). But the model by which you define truth, by your own admission, means that such truths are impossible to know. This issue then is that you advocate for making these value judgments on the basis of "truth" which, by your definition, contains things unknowable. The result being, in my view, atrocities and other violations of human dignity justified on an
[01:34:32] <shea> unsatisfactory basis.
[01:34:42] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: so what? :S what are you on about?
[01:35:10] <causative_> because you said:  <I_Am_M00t> what people actually mean is that humans are more intelligent, not moral
[01:35:15] <causative_> I'm not saying humans are more moral than cows
[01:35:20] <causative_> I'm saying they have more moral *value*, which is different
[01:36:21] <I_Am_M00t> right, but moral value according to ?
[01:36:29] <causative_> shea, yes, we should be very careful about committing any atrocities "for the greater good"; it's easy to be wrong about that, as you say
[01:36:43] <I_Am_M00t> at some point, it's the human who's defining what is or isn't moral
[01:36:49] <causative_> we should default to not causing harm unless we can be *very* sure the harm will cause benefit
[01:37:02] <causative_> which we usually can't
[01:37:09] <evolv> and truth-seeking is not necessarily a utility
[01:37:11] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[01:37:14] <evolv> it depends on what is sought
[01:37:18] <shea> causative_, the point that I'm making is that, hollistically, your ideas lack cohension. You are making the admissions, and as such you are necessarily undermining the individual points that you make
[01:37:25] <evolv> nobody actually cares how many licks it takes to get into the center of a tootsie pop
[01:38:16] <causative_> that's a good point evolv , when I say truth-seeking is the highest good I'm talking about something that arches over lesser truths, unifies them in a greater understanding
[01:38:39] <causative_> tootsie pop licks are a lesser truth, the science of candymaking is a higher one, materials science in general is higher still
[01:39:22] <causative_> we should pursue the great truths, or the greatest that we can reach
[01:39:37] <evolv> those are subjective judgments
[01:40:26] <causative_> perhaps, perhaps not - I think there is something quantifiable about an overarching truth that sets it apart from the lesser truths it accounts for
[01:40:49] <causative_> hard to say exactly how to quantify that but I have the intuition that it's possible
[01:41:15] <causative_> for instance, we can talk about how central the truth is to a domain - how many steps it takes to go from that truth to some lesser truth of interest
[01:41:22] <causative_> more central truths are greater
[01:41:48] <I_Am_M00t> this feels like when you said "any mathematical formula is a physical object" because you can "put it down on paper"
[01:42:05] <I_Am_M00t> what you actually meant was that "any idea can be written down"
[01:42:18] <causative_> that would be a dramatic oversimplification
[01:42:31] <I_Am_M00t> simple language is good
[01:42:32] <causative_> and a misunderstanding
[01:42:34] <shea> I think what he means to say is that some truths have a greater significance than others due to it relating to something more fundamental, but that is not to say that one truth is more of a truth than another
[01:43:25] <I_Am_M00t> there should be rules about using overly complicated language in discussions
[01:43:58] <shea> I think it's more of symptom of speaking of things about our own competence
[01:44:14] <shea> We do not understand these ideas well enough to express them appropriately
[01:44:21] <I_Am_M00t> basically, it seems like some issues don't require complicated language
[01:45:04] <I_Am_M00t> yea, some ideas/facts are more general
[01:45:15] <I_Am_M00t> that's obvious
[01:45:35] <shea> If that is his meaning, it wouldn't likely be disputed
[01:46:11] <shea> The problem is that we argue with his shadow at times because the truth meaning is obsfuscated behind needless jargon
[01:46:22] <I_Am_M00t> that's why you need rules against complicated language
[01:48:06] <shea> This is not a problem generally in the IRC channel

[01:51:58] <ro-bot-o> [url] George Orwell: Politics and the English Language | www.orwell.ru
[01:52:19] <shea> Also, this thought just struck me. causative_, do we consider those who are disabled to have a smaller moral value than those who are not on the basis of the incapacity for truth-seeking? Do babies have a reduced moral value?
[01:52:42] <shea> And so on?
[01:54:12] <Ungwelian> I'd guess causative's point was, that people's value comes from their inherent capability for justice.
[01:54:35] <shea> I think this is my fundamental objection to your entire doctrine, if my understanding is correct. That we tie the value of things to their capacity and not on the basis of their essence. For my part, that humans have moral value above all other creatures is something that I take as axoimatic, which may be unsatisfactory for some but I have not the skill to elaborate further. I don't hold
[01:54:36] <shea> myself out to be intelligent.
[01:54:47] <Ungwelian> Even with babies and the incapacitated, the capability is still potentially there.
[01:55:00] <I_Am_M00t> what about old people? :O
[01:55:10] <I_Am_M00t> bed ridden, ill! :O
[01:55:30] <Ungwelian> Was that to shea or me? :P
[01:55:43] <shea> Ungwelian, I'm not sure that I got that from what he has said, but if you are correct I am still not persuaded.
[01:55:50] <causative_> well, to say that humans have moral value on the basis of the shape of our bodies is obviously arbitrary. A person in a different shape, with the same mind, is still a person. If we have moral value it has to be our minds.
[01:56:31] <shea> But how about my previous objections? What say you?
[01:56:37] <causative_> babies once born are very good at learning and truth-seeking - they soak up experiences like a sponge. And they have great potential. So they are valuable in that sense.
[01:57:01] <causative_> older adults have unique experiences and wisdom
[01:57:18] <shea> And the disabled? (I will return to your point about babies afterwards)
[01:57:31] <shea> So far, you are still speaking the language of capacty
[01:57:39] <shea> s/capacty/capacity
[01:57:39] <ro-bot-o> shea meant to say: So far, you are still speaking the language of capacity
[01:58:25] <causative_> different people are morally valuable to different extents; a mass murderer is less valuable than Jonas Salk who invented the polio vaccine
[01:58:26] <shea> And what of eugenics? What if we could determine the ceiling of one's truth-seeking capacity before birth?
[01:58:49] <causative_> so yes, if someone is in a vegetative state then I would say they lack moral value, and it is moral to end their life support
[01:59:18] <causative_> if someone is less severely disabled than that, they are still likely far above any animal; someone with Down's syndrome is many times smarter than any non-human animal
[01:59:36] <causative_> so they still have substantial moral value, but perhaps not as much as a well person
[01:59:55] <shea> You said earlier (and you must forgive me audrey) that Godwin's Law is often invoked in such a way that it impedes learning the lessens of Nazi Germany. I suggest that you are sleepwalking right into similar ways of thinking.
[02:00:27] <shea> The renaissance of natural law was born from the aftermath of WWII after all
[02:01:36] <shea> This doctrine of yours, what you have just said, is perverse to me, and utterly repugnant.
[02:02:13] <causative_> suppose you take an anteater and use some future machine to give it the body of a human, and change its genes to that of a human too, without changing its mind
[02:02:17] *** Quits: Awaru (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:02:22] <causative_> does this anteater-human have the moral value of an anteater, or of a human?
[02:02:53] <causative_> biologically it is a disabled human, if you discount the history of what it used to be
[02:03:05] <shea> Insofar as it is human, it has the moral worth of a human. As it said before, for me it is axiomatic that human life has superior moral value.
[02:03:15] <causative_> and how far is it human?
[02:03:25] <causative_> how much moral worth does it have?
[02:05:29] <shea> Well, I'm not sure even how what you say would work, what it exactly it means. But if I were to say that it is utterly indistinguishable from a human, then it is entirely a human. As to how much moral worth it has, it has that moral worth attributable to all humans categorically
[02:06:01] <causative_> so just by changing its outward form, you say it acquired moral value, even though its mind was unchanged?
[02:06:29] <causative_> that does not agree with me, intuitively changing the outward form should make no moral difference
[02:08:05] <shea> Well I wouldn't consider it a mere change of form if you are to say that it is totally indistinguishable from a human. But in any case, I do not hold myself out as a person who could satisfactorily explain what I consider to be axiomatic. And although what I say is without proper explanation, it is far preferrable to your doctrine, even though explicitly explained.
[02:08:31] <shea> In other words, I do not consider being human a mere form

[02:21:40] <causative_> I couldn't make a direct comparison between this person and an average person
[02:22:03] <evolvidle> as it turns out, compassionate and positivity carry a lot of weight
[02:22:28] <causative_> I would agree compassion carries a lot of weight, positivity is just a bias though

[02:24:12] <causative_> none of those are even particularly difficult words
[02:24:19] <shea> What I will say, causative_, is that, when constructing a moral framework, I do not consider it profitable to reduce every aspect of that framework to a perfect science, capable of being observed or proven in a temporal (worldly) sense. In this sense, you might say that the goal of such a moral framework is not to arrive at truth as we can know it on earth. For me, the goal is to live a good
[02:24:21] <shea> and happy life, both on an individual and societal level. At least on a societal level, we must remember that any such moral framework in a practical sense serves a purpose regulating relationships between citizens and the state. Like Plato, I believe in those things that you might term spritiual that are unable to be falsified by science as we know it. But even if we were to say that things
[02:24:23] <shea> are not true, I believe, like Plato, that a moral framework that tells such noble lies is better than one that does not. Turning to the ant eater, if I were pushed I would say that it is not a human because it lacks those intangible aspects of humanity which is its essence. Like I say, to be human is not a matter of form. It is constituted of tangible and intangible aspects. These intangible
[02:24:25] <shea> aspects gives it its moral worth. If these be noble lies, they still give rise to better moral framework than the one that you have espoused today. Your purely scientific and wordly approach paves the road for a totally clinical, utilitarian hellworld that I do not wish to live in,

[02:33:00] <I_Am_M00t> "It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think
[02:33:00] <I_Am_M00t> he means something quite different."
[02:33:08] <I_Am_M00t> wow
[02:33:12] <causative_> suppose I am happy that I suffer
[02:33:21] <I_Am_M00t> it's so apt
[02:33:30] <causative_> suppose I would rather suffer a little more and know a little more truth, than suffer a little less and remain ignorant
[02:33:32] <I_Am_M00t> replace democracy with "truth"
[02:33:34] <evolv> I won't suppose a logically impossibility
[02:33:47] <I_Am_M00t> replace democracy with "polite"
[02:34:18] <evolv> nobody likes suffering, but few believe in the possibility of its total cessation
[02:34:21] <causative_> evolv, in conversations like these I like to bring up the "cow button."  If you press this button you experience nothing but pleasure, and no more suffering, for the rest of your long life. And your mind is reduced to the level of a cow's.
[02:34:29] <causative_> I myself would absolutely not press the cow button
[02:34:34] <causative_> how about you?
[02:34:43] <evolv> I don't need to press a button, the path has been outlined
[02:35:00] <evolv> to know if it's true, you have to test it out for yourself
[02:35:01] <causative_> really, you think you're on a path that will lead you to nothing but pleasure and no suffering for the rest of your life?
[02:35:06] <evolv> see, there is some truth-seeking there
[02:35:07] <evolv> :)
[02:35:18] <evolv> but will you do the truth-seeking?
[02:35:39] <causative_> who told you this path would lead to total pleasure and no suffering?
[02:35:54] <evolv> it is not total pleasure
[02:36:00] <evolv> it is peace
[02:36:04] <causative_> and no suffering
[02:36:04] <evolv> contentment
[02:36:09] <I_Am_M00t> Buddha! :D
[02:36:09] *** Quits: medium_cool (~medium_co@2605:a601:a9aa:f800:e079:3d56:c8cd:8e66) (Quit: I have gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[02:36:12] <evolv> I_Am_M00t :)
[02:36:31] <causative_> it's a dream - if your back hurts your back hurts. You can be more or less at peace with it but it's still going to hurt
[02:36:41] <evolv> really?
[02:36:49] <evolv> because you do know that pain is not physical, it's mental
[02:36:49] <I_Am_M00t> Enter the Buddhahood
[02:37:17] <causative_> yeah I am familiar with Buddhism, and it has good things to say, but you're never going to reach a total cessation of suffering
[02:37:23] <causative_> it can *help* but it's never going to be perfect
[02:37:36] <causative_> and you wouldn't have the total pleasure that the cow button could give you
[02:37:39] <evolv> you can't say that, causative_
[02:37:50] <evolv> you never did any truth seeking there
[02:37:59] <evolv> it's just a wild guess, a hunch on your part
[02:38:02] <evolv> like a flip of the coin
[02:38:22] <causative_> when I say I am familiar with Buddhism I mean I meditate every day and read Shunryu Suzuki, Thich Nhat Hanh, and others
[02:38:33] <evolv> that doesn't mean anything
[02:38:39] <causative_> but you're still limited by your brain
[02:38:43] <causative_> your physical, human brain
[02:38:43] <evolv> meditation is the seventh factor of the eightfold path
[02:38:50] <evolv> reading isn't practice
[02:39:04] <causative_> a lot of Buddhism is also wrong, e.g. when they talk about reincarnation
[02:39:20] <evolv> and you have wrong view, the eightfold path aren't eight independent factors, they're linked
[02:39:44] <evolv> each factor follows from the preceding. You have to have right view
[02:40:03] <causative_> there's no "magic" in the world - what Zen meditation can give you is a greater sense of peace, but nothing in the world is perfect or ever will be perfect
[02:40:15] *** Quits: mikey (~mikey@user/mikey) (Quit: stay well)
[02:40:17] <evolv> how do you know rebirth is wrong?
[02:40:26] <evolv> you didn't do any truth-seeking there, neither
[02:40:32] <causative_> there's no transcendental self, meditation is all just applied psychology
[02:40:33] <evolv> again, just a guess, a hunch. An act of faith
[02:40:41] <evolv> your faith in annihilation without evidence
[02:40:58] <causative_> because scince
[02:41:00] <causative_> science
[02:41:07] <causative_> there's no scientific mechanism by which it could happen
[02:41:14] <causative_> no evidence for it
[02:41:27] <evolv> and no evidence for your proposal
[02:41:30] <causative_> plenty of evidence that the brain is a mechanical object
[02:41:36] <evolv> you rely on the principle of parsimony
[02:41:37] <evolv> which is not science
[02:41:42] <evolv> it's incorporated in science
[02:41:46] <causative_> the principle of parsimony is central to science
[02:41:46] <evolv> again, faith
[02:42:10] <evolv> but it is not science
[02:42:17] <evolv> it doesn't determine was is true
[02:42:24] <causative_> it determines what is probable
[02:42:27] <evolv> neither do evidence from experiments
[02:42:48] <causative_> nothing is ever perfectly certain, but evidence and parsimony help us to decide what's more probable, which is the best anyone can do
[02:42:53] <causative_> evidence always beats supposition
[02:42:59] <evolv> what is more probable?
[02:43:06] <evolv> what if you used frequentist statistics? Bayesian?
[02:43:12] <causative_> use Bayesian
[02:43:19] <causative_> frequentist statistics isn't really a coherent whole
[02:43:24] <evolv> but how do you know your priors are valuable?
[02:43:44] <evolv> Bayesian statistics often lead to wrong conclusions
[02:43:48] <causative_> if the priors are bad, collect evidence to update them until the posterior is good
[02:43:49] <evolv> so here we are again
[02:44:04] <evolv> collect evidence, but with no statistical measures?
[02:44:09] <causative_> yes, we are often wrong, but "we are often wrong" does not mean "my pet belief is right"
[02:44:11] <evolv> to feed into priors?
[02:44:12] <evolv> lol
[02:44:37] <causative_> we should use only methods that are demonstrated to effectively find the truth
[02:44:44] <causative_> which does not mean perfectly - but good enough
[02:45:04] <causative_> like a carpenter wants a good lathe, a philosopher needs a good truthmaking-system
[02:45:12] <evolv> you've never done science, I take it
[02:45:14] <causative_> and "religious hope" or "ancient texts" are not such a system
[02:45:39] <evolv> the dhamma is for you to test
[02:45:53] <evolv> nibbana cannot be achieved by faith
[02:45:56] <evolv> only by practice
[02:46:02] <evolv> you have a method
[02:46:05] <evolv> :)
[02:46:11] <evolv> see, it's empirical
[02:46:28] <shea> A purely scientific world view is so woefully narrow; so woefully artificial. I see it as an affliction.
[02:46:38] <evolv> your skepticism is because of what? Desire not to do truth-seeking because of religious bias, causative_?
[02:46:54] <evolv> this goes entirely against your value towards truth-seeking
[02:47:01] <evolv> your convinctions are not sincere
[02:47:05] <causative_> if it's empirical then there should be plenty of evidence, evolv - I should be able to read a paper demonstrating how many people who tried this achieved perfect freedom from suffering and how many did not
[02:47:10] <causative_> can you point me at such a paper?
[02:47:13] <evolv> a paper is not evidence
[02:47:16] <evolv> a paper is just a paper
[02:47:17] <shea> I would imagine causative_ is fain to assert that artificial intelligence is a transcendental state
[02:47:30] <evolv> do you do all of the experiments yourself from those papers, causative_?
[02:47:35] <evolv> or do you take those papers by faith alone?
[02:48:00] <evolv> something like 80% of pre-clinical studies fail replication
[02:48:05] <causative_> not faith, but trust in the scientific process - a trust that depends on the quality of the paper, what other scientists say about it, what field it's in and the reputation of that field
[02:48:17] *** Quits: chomwitt (~chomwitt@2a02:587:dc1e:c100:12c3:7bff:fe6d:d374) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:48:32] <causative_> as you say, I would indeed not trust a pre-clinical study that much
[02:48:51] <evolv> you'd be surprise how much junk are in scientific journals, respectable ones
[02:48:53] <evolv> highly cited ones
[02:49:35] <causative_> it wouldn't surprise me because I've read about that kind of stuff
[02:49:55] <causative_> I proportion my skepticism to the quality of the truth-seeking process that produced the claim
[02:50:07] <causative_> inversely proportion
[02:50:19] <shea> In causative_'s world, computers will eventually be the prelates of the new church, authoritatively setting out the dictates of morality on the basis of highly complex algorithms and mathematical formulas.
[02:51:09] <causative_> there are other fields of study where the conclusions are much more reliable
[02:51:44] <causative_> for example, I would be extremely trusting of a paper on experimental physics, or a well-reviewed materials science paper reporting the creation of a new kind of material
[02:52:02] <causative_> or of a well-reviewed mathematics paper
[02:54:59] <causative_> because the conclusions in those fields are fairly concrete and verifiable, not searching for weak statistical trends in small populations
[02:57:46] <evolv> you can personally test the dhamma, causative_. You cannot personally test the bulk of scientific studies
[02:58:58] <causative_> if I did, it would be anecdotal evidence only
[02:59:26] <causative_> and I could personally test the religious beliefs of any number of religions or cults that promise prosperity if only I would follow them
[02:59:34] <shea> Your whole approach is essentially one of "Scientism"---the Positivist rejection of metaphysics (and ethics and religion), causative_. However, some might say that such an exclusion is not good science. Feyerabend argues, for example, that in order to do truly good science, one can't rule out alternative methods, ad hoc hypotheses, mythology, religion and wishful thinking -- he calls this
[02:59:36] <shea> "Epistemological Anarchism".
[02:59:55] <causative_> I do not reject metaphysics or ethics
[03:00:22] <shea> So you say, but you live and die on falsifiability don't you?
[03:00:53] <causative_> I wouldn't say that - the notion of "falsifiability" is important but not really what I focus on
[03:01:05] <shea> As you said previously: "we should use only methods that are demonstrated to effectively find the truth"
[03:01:11] <evolv> from my observation, it's not falsifiability, it's verificationism where causative_ lives and dies by
[03:01:24] <causative_> I prefer the term "persuasionism"
[03:01:31] <causative_> which is more accurate
[03:01:37] <evolv> yes, the popularity contest
[03:01:40] <shea> Then you cannot dismiss the intangible
[03:01:51] <causative_> ugh evolv , again? I told you multiple times it's got nothing to do with popularity and you just repeat
[03:01:52] <shea> You cannot dismiss those elements of humans which cannot be observed
[03:02:06] <evolv> causative_, most reasonable people believe in something religious
[03:02:08] <evolv> now what?
[03:02:13] <evolv> what do we do?
[03:02:16] <causative_> we don't care
[03:02:28] <causative_> because, for I think the 4th time, it's not about popularity at all
[03:02:29] <evolv> so your popularity contest model fails again
[03:02:32] <evolv> yes, it is
[03:02:35] <evolv> that's exactly what it is
[03:02:36] <causative_> okay and this would be time number 5
[03:03:01] <evolv> you can dress it up in a way that is pleasant to you, but it's still a popularity contest no matter your denial
[03:03:05] <causative_> persuasionism concerns itself with the idealized mind of a single individual, in the limit as that individual investigates all possible evidence
[03:03:18] <causative_> there is no element of popularity in it, not even any element of more than one person
[03:03:55] <causative_> and generally the one person is the self - what is true, is what I would judge to be true in the limit if I were able to investigate all the evidence as long as I wanted
[03:04:20] <evolv> a popularity contest of one, the person who finds himself a reasonable person
[03:04:25] <evolv> lol
[03:04:30] *** Joins: ethrl (~ethereal@user/doforlove33)
[03:04:36] <causative_> sure, but that's not exactly a "popularity contest" if it's one person
[03:04:56] <evolv> just conceit?
[03:05:11] <causative_> no
[03:05:13] <evolv> yeah
[03:05:26] <causative_> it's acceptance of your limitations
[03:05:27] <evolv> certainly not a model that provides any utility
[03:05:37] <evolv> given you've decided you're a reasonable person
[03:05:52] <evolv> then anything you believe in is considered truth
[03:06:08] <causative_> no, that is also a wrong interpretation
[03:06:20] <evolv> it is correct
[03:06:39] <causative_> persuasionism is about belief *in the limit*, not in the present
[03:06:56] <evolv> it's about belief
[03:06:56] <causative_> not what I believe now - but what I would believe if I spend a long, long time thinking and studying it
[03:07:04] <causative_> far in the future
[03:07:04] <evolv> yes, faith
[03:07:09] <causative_> which could easily contradict what I think now
[03:07:12] <evolv> of a future that has yet to come
[03:07:16] <evolv> an imaginary realm
[03:07:35] <causative_> you keep applying these random labels to "persuasionism," none of which fit, and none of the labels agree with each other
[03:07:39] <evolv> however, would you know if you fall outside the category of a reasonable person?
[03:07:44] *** Joins: medium_cool (~medium_co@2605:a601:a9aa:f800:5c05:87c9:9af0:4a4d)
[03:08:15] <causative_> perhaps I am. but like I said it's about understanding of one's limitations. It's also about accepting responsibility.
[03:08:47] <causative_> the limitation is:  I am inside my own head; I can't get out. The judgments I make are mine alone.  the responsibility is: to make those judgments, and to understand that no one else can make them for me.
[03:08:59] <causative_> each person should accept that limitation and that responsibility; if they do not, they lie to themselves
[03:09:25] <causative_> your beliefs are your decision, you are the gatekeeper of your own mind
[03:09:56] <evolv> all of that is fine, but it doesn't make you a reasonable person
[03:10:03] <causative_> perhaps I'm not
[03:10:06] <evolv> it's a good quality of a reasonable person, sure
[03:10:25] <causative_> I hope I am, and I try to be
[03:10:55] <evolv> but it only takes one unreasonable belief and motivation to act on that belief to do a monstrous thing
[03:11:29] <causative_> sure, so we'd best be vigilant and try our best to not hold unreasonable beliefs, eh?
[03:11:41] <evolv> true, but the value is not on a person, now is it?
[03:11:43] <evolv> it's on an action
[03:11:54] <evolv> actions have worth, people are vessels for actions
[03:12:11] *** Quits: ethrl (~ethereal@user/doforlove33) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:12:14] <causative_> maybe
[03:12:23] <evolv> actions can change. A person who has done monstrous acts can go on to do nothing but compassionate, wonderful acts
[03:12:47] <causative_> I say that truth-seeking is most important, and truth-seeking is an action
[03:12:49] <evolv> so it's best to place judgement on actions, not people, given people can and do change
[03:12:54] <evolv> that's a lesson Buddhism teaches
[03:13:01] <evolv> there is a reason for that
[03:13:05] <causative_> well it's a reasonable lesson
[03:13:12] <evolv> perhaps you should practice more
[03:13:30] <causative_> but we should also notice that if someone committed horrible acts in the past, they have the potential to do it again
[03:13:47] <causative_> people do have dispositions towards certain kinds of actions, that don't change that much over time
[03:13:47] <evolv> we all have that potential
[03:13:50] <evolv> only arahants do not
[03:13:57] <causative_> it's a matter of degree
[03:13:58] <evolv> the fully unbound
[03:14:02] <causative_> some have greater potential and some lesser
[03:14:03] <evolv> those who have achieved nibbana
[03:14:21] *** Joins: Trashlord (~trash@user/trashlord)
[03:14:27] <causative_> a murderer has in his heart a greater potential than the average person to murder again
[03:14:49] <causative_> so we should not forget that he murdered, just because he behaved well recently
[03:14:58] <evolv> that is how we assume a false self in someone who murders (action)
[03:15:03] <causative_> because that latent variable is still there in his mind - disposing him more towards murder
[03:15:11] <evolv> we trap them in the box of a false self, not enabling them to be something more
[03:15:30] <evolv> by limiting that person, we increase the probability of that person believing that false self and commiting murderous acts again
[03:15:38] <evolv> and we do this to ourselves, too
[03:16:36] <evolv> that is another reasonable lesson from Buddhism
[03:16:48] <evolv> 2500 hundred years ago somebody figured that out
[03:21:03] <causative_> well, it's true, however it does not mean we should always be kind to murderers
[03:21:12] <causative_> the chance of reform is there, but so is the chance of re-offense
[03:22:35] *** Tintle is now known as NewYear
[03:25:05] <evolv> we should always be compassionate
[03:25:36] <evolv> and, as evidence in psychology informs us, the focus of reform should be positive reinforcement
[03:26:01] <evolv> and, again, a reasonable lesson in Buddhism where Buddha prohibited punishment
[03:26:30] <causative_> to prohibit punishment is to give whatever you have to whoever is willing to take it from you
[03:26:46] <causative_> even self-defense is a form of punishment
[03:27:19] <causative_> you threaten to hurt them - to punish them - to dissuade them from hurting you
[03:30:22] <evolv> but the scientific evidence demonstrate that punishment has low efficacy in reform of any kind
[03:30:54] <evolv> believing counter to the evidence would, I'd argue, be unreasonable

[08:32:10] *** Joins: shea (~shea@user/shea)
[08:44:31] <Delf> Death might (no promises) end the pain, but it sure as fuck will not end the suffering.
[08:45:34] <Delf> We merely console ourselves when believing death ends suffering.
[08:46:43] <causative_> sure it would, in the same manner that crashing your car makes the "check engine" light go off
[08:46:59] <causative_> (in this analogy, the "check engine" light is suffering; suffering is a signal our bodies give us that something is wrong)
[08:50:19] <causative_> the notion of a continuous single line of consciousness is incorrect - there is no way to make it make sense through teleporter thought experiments or brain uploading. What we have are isolated moments of awareness. Some of the moments of consciousness are in your head, others are in mine. Some are in the future, some in the past. Death is just a case of not finding any more moments of consciousness in a particular place.
[08:51:45] <causative_> if we think of all the moments of consciousness in the whole universe as like a set of points, plotted by position and time, death is just a temporal boundary of some of the points
[08:54:44] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:54:52] <causative_> like, imagine scattering some salt on your table and arranging it into rows or whatever shapes you desire. Say that left-right is the time direction. Death is just where there are some salt grains where if you move to the right, you don't find any more salt grains in that spot.
[08:55:16] <causative_> each salt grain in this analogy is a moment of consciousness at a time and place
[09:00:23] <Delf> Is this an compliment or insult, I'm not sure. Why am I being compared to a vehicle?
[09:00:40] <causative_> the mistake would be to think we can always follow a line of consciousness in the rightwards (positive time) direction; it's just not the case, sometimes those lines of consciousness split or end
[09:01:11] <causative_> like a road may split or end
[09:02:25] <Delf> This is making me considering to end it
[09:03:49] <causative_> well, I don't know your situation, but usually such feelings are because of psychological problems that might be solved
[09:04:16] <Delf> Yes, death might solve my psychological problems
[09:04:20] <causative_> question would be what you've done to try to solve them, drugs or therapy
[09:04:33] <Delf> Nothing works
[09:04:41] <Delf> Turns out, this is the human condition
[09:04:47] <causative_> question would be what you've tried
[09:05:11] <Delf> I've tried drugs but I haven't tried death
[09:05:25] <Delf> From the looks of it you seem pretty sure about it
[09:05:32] <causative_> when you say drugs do you mean prescribed antidepressants, or just random recreational drugs? and have you tried therapy?
[09:06:28] <Delf> I've done prescribed antidepressants, anti psychotics... brain numbing stuff.. and I've done other drugs but that's for a whole different purpose, not to treat depression
[09:06:41] <causative_> and therapy?
[09:06:54] <causative_> also I've heard good things about psilocybin as an experimental depression treatment
[09:07:10] <Delf> I don't think I've tried therapy. Would it reorder the construction of my brains?
[09:07:32] <causative_> every thought you have, every act you perform, reorders the construction of your brain
[09:07:37] <causative_> life is change
[09:07:49] <Delf> I'm not talking about the neurons now
[09:08:19] <Delf> You got to have those in order to re-order them :P. I don't have any
[09:08:29] <causative_> you do have neurons
[09:10:16] <Delf> It was a joke mate...
[09:10:41] <Delf> But I haven't checked. I'm just assuming I have them. I would probably not notice if I didn't have them anyway
[09:11:11] <causative_> I would say, as long as there's something you haven't tried to solve your problems while alive, you should try that. and also go back on the antidepressants you tried in the past and went off of.
[09:11:31] <causative_> otherwise you're giving up when the battle can still be won
[09:11:32] <audrey> [insert disclaimer about not taking medical advice from strangers on the internet]
[09:11:57] <Delf> Postponing the inevitable
[09:12:18] <Delf> Hes not a stranger
[09:12:38] <Delf> But a good point, nonetheless
[09:13:38] <Delf> You do realize there is a LOT more work (foundational kind) if you were to even consider the slightest possibility that death is not the end of suffering
[09:14:25] <causative_> others go on suffering
[09:14:37] <Delf> Yes, I know you'd miss me
[09:14:42] <causative_> but suffering is just a signal, like a check engine light
[09:14:48] <Delf> No, that's pain
[09:14:51] <causative_> suffering doesn't matter, what matters is that the car is functioning
[09:15:07] <Delf> Suffering is what we're made to do to ourselves and each other
[09:15:30] <Delf> It's not mandatory... but it's strongly encouraged
[09:16:45] <Delf> There's no reason for me to run from depression or avoid doing things that could lead to depression
[09:17:04] <causative_> IMO depression is despair - the feeling that you can't achieve what you intend, a lack of mastery over your condition and your future
[09:17:41] <causative_> it may be different for different people, but if that's the problem, then picking achievable goals could help you regain control and banish the despair
[09:18:55] <Delf> That's exactly what I do. Simple goals. Make coffee. Clean the cat litter box etc...
[09:19:18] <causative_> well, how about goals that are different from what you've been doing, goals that have in them some sort of advance and change
[09:20:02] <Delf> What kind of change?
[09:20:13] <causative_> like, talking to new people, taking up achievable longer-term goals
[09:20:16] *** Joins: I_Am_M00t (uid427178@id-427178.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[09:20:38] <causative_> that can be broken into smaller short-term goals
[09:21:24] <Delf> I'm socially retarded and I live in Sweden so... if you're not socially retarded, you will become socially retarded
[09:21:37] <causative_> and if that's not possible, see someone who can help you - mental health counseling
[09:21:53] <Delf> Relax mate, I'm alright
[09:22:04] <causative_> if you want to change your life you need to add new ingredients to it
[09:22:05] <Delf> I know I'm insane but I'm good
[09:22:31] <Delf> I don't want to change my life actually
[09:22:33] <causative_> it has to be something from outside yourself, something different in your surroundings or activities
[09:22:57] <Delf> Why does it have to? The most "meat" so to speak I've found is that which is deep within
[09:23:02] <causative_> if you change your surroundings, activities, and associates, then your behavior and your feelings will also change
[09:23:09] <causative_> people are products of their circumstances
[09:23:26] <causative_> you've probably spent a very long time looking deep within - and sure, it may help, but in that time how much has changed?
[09:23:28] <Delf> What's wrong with my feelings?
[09:23:31] <causative_> you need something more
[09:23:49] <Delf> Well, the snow melted
[09:24:06] <Delf> I could take the bicycle and go shopping

[09:24:40] <Delf> Well what I actually need is another delf
[09:24:55] <Delf> It's like Neo and Trinity when they shake hands

[09:26:02] <I_Am_M00t> you should clone yourself, i know a place
[09:26:49] <Delf> Do they clone pets too?
[09:27:05] <I_Am_M00t> my life has changed greatly since i got a clone
[09:27:11] <I_Am_M00t> only pigs
[09:29:52] <Delf> causative_: Fundamental changes have been made in the sense that humans finding it increasingly hard to relate to me. Other than that, I've developed a few identities, code of conduct, set of intentions and detachment
[09:31:13] <Delf> There are inherent problems with regarding death as a means of en to suffering
[09:31:24] <Delf> First of all, it gives people hope, and that's not a good thing
[09:32:26] <Delf> Hope is hopeless. We need determination
[09:33:59] <Delf> Friend of mine was committing suicide and then he realized that there might be hell so he bailed out on death
[09:34:31] <Delf> Mere realization that you just simply don't fucking know what death is. Stay open minded
[09:36:06] <Delf> He was convinced that he'd go to hell for committing suicide. I couldn't prevent myself from laughing when he told me this. I told him, hell is not that bad, it's where I'm from. But he wouldn't be going to hell... there are far worse places than this

[10:58:54] <Delf> You're NOT getting off the hook that easily... *evil smile*

[11:00:10] <arryana> that all our experiences just repeat endlessly, as a loop, being our chunk of time.

[11:41:36] <Delf> Big ask? It's great, and it's achievable even :D
[11:41:47] <arryana> first you'd have to define full autonomy.  and wanting something for everyone is... large.
[11:41:52] <arryana> oooh, ta, lumi
[11:42:18] <arryana> and i don't see how wanting a win/lose game is an improvement.
[11:42:23] <Delf> Full autonomy means we self-define, we're no longer defined by nature but by our own capacity to evolve. We're not dependant on each other, the nature or this planet.
[11:42:33] <arryana> that doesn't mean a lot to me either.
[11:42:55] <arryana> by that statement, pigs could desire wings and magically have them

[11:43:17] <arryana> i don't see life being a fantasy as any more of an improvement either
[11:43:33] <Delf> It be better to evolve their mental capacity first and let them pick their own path of evolution
[11:43:56] <arryana> and wanting the lack of depending on each other and cooperation at the same time seems at odds.
[11:44:10] <arryana> yeah, see, you're losing me in all this 'imaginary universe' stuff

[11:58:31] <Delf> Perfectly understandable
[11:59:23] <arryana> i doubt you'll ever find what you're looking for with definitions so vague.
[11:59:49] <arryana> and expecting everyone else to be what you can't clearly define is... well, not realistic.

[12:38:42] <arryana> i know what the person who set me on the road to a bigger life would suggest to you.
[12:39:07] <arryana> he'd say, 'make a list of ten things which would make your life better'.  then he would suggest spending an hour a day on the easiest one to accomplish.
[12:39:52] <arryana> not esoteric things like, 'i want the world to be like (this)'
[12:40:19] <arryana> but actual concrete things which would make your life better.  like a better diet, more exercise, going back to school, etc
[12:40:56] <Delf> One of which is returning to day-shift
[12:41:12] <arryana> that's a good example
[12:41:25] <arryana> for that he would suggest two things
[12:42:22] <arryana> the first would be to hand you a sheet of paper with the day broken down into half hour increments.  and he'd have you fill in each half hour with -what you actually did-.  the second would be for you to turn off all lights and screens an hour before you want to be asleep, and not turn them back on until your intended wake up time
[12:42:51] <arryana> he would have you do both of those things for ten consecutive days
[12:44:37] <arryana> i can personally attest to the usefulness of the first exercise, he did that to me when i told him that i had no time, as a student
[12:45:30] <Delf> This is good for creating some structure
[12:45:46] <arryana> i -was- validly a lot more obligated with work and classes than he realized, but it was still a great education in what really happened to my time.  though in my case he had to give me a daily sheet broken down into 15 minute increments
[12:45:52] <arryana> but i had two jobs and six classes
[12:46:27] <arryana> he didn't do it for structure, he did it because most people fool themselves about where they're spending their time
[12:47:56] <Delf> This is true
[12:47:59] <arryana> in my own case, it opened an eye i've never been able to close, for which i'm very grateful

[13:06:06] <Delf> Alright then. Here goes. Do you have kids?
[13:06:33] <arryana> nope, when i was young i had three foster kids.  i have two godchildren and two grand-godchildren.
[13:06:45] <arryana> i would foster again if the right kid needed a place to be.
[13:07:01] <Delf> Foster kids are still kids
[13:07:19] <arryana> at the moment, it would not work for me, as my mother is in hospice care and requires me to attend to things for her on a level that would not be appropriate to try to raise a child with

[13:09:50] <arryana> i'm never sure quite why it happens, but neighborhood teens start by petting my dogs, then coming over for tea to tell me their troubles, then come to learn to cook, or fix things, or to hang out in the garden and learn to do that.
[13:10:44] <arryana> mostly i think they come because my house is peaceful.

[13:13:14] <arryana> living a simple life is not as 'humble' or easy as it appears

[13:30:26] <arryana> and i cook a lot.  hence the potions.  he's teasing, it's a joke between us.
[13:31:04] <arryana> having talking dogs = animal familiars
[13:31:08] <arryana> at least in the joke parlance
[13:32:40] <arryana> having talking dogs is only a start, though.  where i'd really like to take that is to see if they can 'speak for' a nonverbal child.
[13:33:33] <Delf> Example of that would be?
[13:34:07] <arryana> i'm not sure what you mean. my dogs use speech buttons to say words or phrases.  a friend of mine has a child who cannot speak at all, he's autistic.
[13:34:30] <arryana> and i have been considering teaching a dog to speak his needs as a service animal.
[13:34:44] <arryana> one of the buttons in the house is, 'the cat wants something', so i know they can embrace that idea.
[13:35:05] <arryana> they use that if a door has blown shut to trap her in a room, or if she's out of water, etc
[13:37:34] <arryana> when my younger dog was a puppy, the older one reliably hit the 'outside' button when the little one was being housebroken
[13:37:58] <arryana> though the younger was able to trigger the button on her own needs by the time she was twelve weeks old
[13:38:55] <Delf> Interesting way of communicating with animals, using other objects to express something
[13:39:16] <arryana> they have two interfaces, now.
[13:40:02] <arryana> one is the buttons, and they've got maybe 20 of those.  the other is a laptop at their eye level in the hallway which scrolls through ten of the most used phrases, they have left-right buttons to scroll and the center one triggers a voice.
[13:40:26] <arryana> they can't read (yet) but they do have word recognition for those words, they learned from flash cards and repetition
[13:40:38] <Delf> Interesting
[13:40:52] <arryana> my hope is that my friend's child will have a lower frustration level if his needs are understood with more accuracy
[13:41:02] <arryana> and dogs are spectacularly sensitive to the needs of their pack members
[13:46:25] <Delf> That's thoughtful. But a child may become accustomed to the environment and all others around them to adjust to their internal state of emotions
[13:47:13] * arryana shrugs
[13:47:51] <arryana> that's a nice idealistic thought, but in practice it will destroy that family and his future.  his tantrums are already dangerous at four, when he's 12 he would have to be put in residential housing if this continues.
[13:51:49] <arryana> i dont think anyone wants that future for him. while it would be nice to believe the world will magically provide for him, that's not the case.
[13:53:04] <Delf> When hes throwing a tantrun, does he hurt himself primarily or does he look for other things to damage, or even other individuals to hurt?
[13:53:29] <arryana> he hurts anyone and anything in his vicinity.  once he's done with that he hurts himself.
[13:54:11] <arryana> while it's a lovely idea that the world will 'adjust to his internal state', it isn't a healthy one for him or anyone else.
[13:55:04] <Delf> There's trouble there
[13:55:42] <Delf> Rage numbs the internal pain
[13:55:47] <arryana> indeed.  my own dogs understand his behavior and his needs, which mitigates the problem to an extent.  he needs one of his own, though.
[13:58:14] <arryana> more than that, i can think of a lot of circumstances it would be useful.  post-stroke, paralysis, aphasia.
[13:58:52] <Delf> Rage?
[13:59:25] <arryana> rage?
[13:59:31] <arryana> i don't understand
[14:00:00] <Delf> He needs one of his own?
[14:00:13] <Delf> What would be useful post-stroke, paralysis etc
[14:00:22] <arryana> a talking dog.
[14:00:31] <Delf> Oh
[14:01:00] <Delf> When his having a tantrun, do you immobilize him?
[14:01:28] <arryana> for now.  he will be too big for that soon.
[14:01:47] <Delf> Yes, and by then he must develop the values
[14:01:55] <Delf> Or else...!!!
[14:02:02] <arryana> at the moment it's still possible to cuddle him and hum in his ear, which is the fastest way to calm him
[14:02:13] <arryana> but the poor little booger is growing fast.
[14:03:39] <arryana> the bigger problem at the moment is that he has an 18 month old brother.  he has hurt the baby more than once, so priority has become getting the baby out of the room first.
[14:03:40] <Delf> Ohh... I'd never take that approach
[14:03:58] <arryana> easy to say that when you haven't watched him bashing his head bloody against a wall
[14:04:13] <arryana> or tearing at his own eyes with his fingernails
[14:04:18] <Delf> I meant cuddle and him in his ear

[14:11:50] <arryana> his wiring is badly scrambled, i don't see the point in punishing him for it. he's still required to function to the level that he's capable, but when he short-circuits, abusing him does not seem to me to be the answer.

[14:12:21] <arryana> ah

[14:18:24] <arryana> well, i tend to trust the judgement of the dogs on that.  when a kid is acting like a snot by choice, they will make a grumping sound and remove themselves.  in the case of this little boy, they tolerate his flailing and go into his range deliberately to offer comfort and stability.

[14:36:52] * arryana shrugs
[14:37:24] <arryana> there's a lot of pressure on women to validate themselves by having children, i can't tell you how many times i heard 'you'll change your mind when you get older' until i was too old to say such things to.
[14:37:39] <arryana> but most people live more conventional lives than i do.
[14:38:12] <Delf> I see
[14:44:28] <krb> i have 2 kids. it is probably best that someone wants to have them if one is going to have them
[14:44:43] <arryana> i think a lot of people live more conventional lives than they'd really like just because there's a lot of static to wade tbrough when making different choices.
[14:45:05] <krb> it's not so easy when one is a dopamine addict like myself
[14:46:08] <krb> end up turning the kids into dopamine junkeys
[14:46:20] <krb> movies, pcs and tablets.. sugar
[14:49:01] <Delf> Why'd you do that?
[14:49:10] <krb> it's how i'm programmed
[14:50:11] <arryana> ah, i'm strictly a no-screen guardian
[14:51:06] <krb> do you think you could last 5 years as such?
[14:51:16] <arryana> yep
[14:51:23] <Delf> Your sentient, you reprogram yourself mate. You don't pass on the errors that've been passed on to you... onto others!
[14:51:24] <arryana> it's one of the reasons that the teenagers come here
[14:51:38] <arryana> i spent far too many years living without electricity to be fussed by a lack of screen.
[14:51:40] <krb> taking care of house, going to work. preparing foods.. what is the kids suppose to do in the meantime?
[14:51:57] <arryana> oh, it's brutal, they -help-.  which creates more work for me
[14:51:59] <arryana> but it teaches them
[14:52:05] <arryana> they can also read, play with physical toys
[14:52:15] <krb> what if they don't want to do that?
[14:52:16] <Delf> You involve them in the cooking!
[14:52:19] <arryana> hahaha
[14:52:26] <sweetsymph> Why did tou have to live without electricity arryana?
[14:52:28] <arryana> it isn't their job to get what they want all the time
[14:52:46] <arryana> i lived outside
[14:53:12] <sweetsymph> Oh
[14:53:13] <arryana> and when i lived in the vehicles, i wss usually posted in places with no power or water
[14:53:45] <krb> that would probably work as a nice dopamine detox
[14:54:14] <arryana> my parents severely limited our tv as kids
[14:54:23] <sweetsymph> When you homeless?
[14:54:30] <arryana> and i had five brothers, so there was always something more interesting to do anyway
[14:54:48] <arryana> well, i started living in my car when i was 14.  i made an official lifestyle of it until i was in my 20s
[14:54:50] <krb> you probably end up quite healthy then
[14:54:59] <arryana> though some of that time i was hiking the appalachian trail
[14:55:10] <sweetsymph> A friend if mines mother intentionally never bought her kids a TV, she was very alternative but I think it was beneficial to them they are very social and well read
[14:55:14] <arryana> i still have my truck and camper.
[14:55:52] <krb> it's hard for dopamine kids to read books
[14:56:08] <arryana> for me it was just the example of my grandmothers, i think.  they taught me things when i was in my single digits.  instead of planting me in front of a tv, they'd have me learn beading, or how to peel potatoes, or any number of things
[14:56:13] * arryana shrugs
[14:56:17] <arryana> they won't learn if they never try
[14:56:32] <sweetsymph> True
[14:57:08] <krb> during the corona times people probably spent allot of more time in home trying to find dopamine through media and whatnot. so we'll probably get a greater wave of dopamine addicts
[14:57:21] <Delf> See, when you become a parent, your life end. You got to accept that!
[14:57:22] <arryana> one of my favorite childhood activities was taking the bus with my grandmother.  she'd start the game of 'find it'.  she would name something that could be found
[14:57:24] <arryana> 'roses'
[14:57:40] <arryana> then we'd have to look outside and name everything we could see that was or had roses
[14:57:55] <arryana> the things she'd have us look for got harder as we got older.
[14:58:16] <krb> nice activities
[14:58:21] <sweetsymph> Oh nice here in Australia we play eye spy or Animal, vegetable or mineral, same kind if thing
[14:58:25] <arryana> but it did wonders for our attention spans.  then she'd ask questions later. 'where was the blue rose' or 'how many did you see in total'
[14:58:37] <sweetsymph> Or 20 questions to guess what they thought of
[14:59:01] <sweetsymph> That you spot outside the car
[14:59:11] <arryana> it's a lot more work raising kids like that, but i suspect she enjoyed it a lot more, and i -know- we did.
[14:59:29] <arryana> it also taught us a lot of things which were very useful skills later.
[15:00:23] <arryana> car games were usually word games of varying sorts.  making words out of license plate tags, or one that one of us would say a word, and the next one had to start a word with the last letter of the word before
[15:00:28] <arryana> y is the one that gets hardest fastest.
[15:00:42] <arryana> so we collected words like yesterday and yearly to stick our siblings with the problem
[15:00:44] * arryana giggles
[15:01:45] <arryana> i know what all that stuff meant to me, and for my life, so i wouldn't be able to deprive any kid in my care of it.
[15:03:39] <krb> i didn't even own a home before i got my first kid
[15:04:04] <arryana> when my grandmothers got sick of us, they'd give us a jar of buttons to sort, or a deck of cards to play solitaire iwth
[15:04:20] <arryana> or bubbles on the porch, or any number of other such things
[15:04:32] <arryana> two of my foster kids traveled with me
[15:05:02] <arryana> but i wouldn't raise a child like that for their entire childhood.  and foster kids don't really come from normal or stable homes, so it isn't as destructive as it would be to another kid.
[15:05:05] <krb> i give money to my kids when i get them to do things for me
[15:05:10] <arryana> hahah
[15:05:35] <arryana> we were taught that no day was complete until we did something -for someone else- without being thanked or noticed.
[15:05:36] <krb> true capitalists :)
[15:05:46] <arryana> that was our contribution.
[15:05:56] <arryana> as one of my friends puts it, 'acts of service are her love language'
[15:06:24] <krb> i have a college like that. he gives everything he has extra to africa
[15:06:45] <arryana> i guess i could donate money, but i prefer to donate time.
[15:06:46] <krb> he has nothing for himself, and he always helps friends for free and such
[15:07:30] <krb> he's a engineer and he's very intelligent. and he ask me if he could use a computer from 1997 instead of having to buy one. and i was like "are you kidding"
[15:07:48] <arryana> haha
[15:08:48] <krb> now his body is failing him, he's always stressed
[15:08:54] <krb> believe the world is out to get him
[15:09:06] <krb> and he has this personality that seems more like a beggar
[15:09:52] <krb> im sure most he helped wouldn't care to help him back
[15:10:02] <arryana> huh.
[15:10:07] <arryana> that sounds like a lack of life balance.
[15:10:09] <arryana> shame
[15:10:19] <krb> yeah
[15:10:42] <krb> he's a victim of christianity
[15:11:37] <krb> it would have been better for him to be paid for all his work for "friends"
[15:11:41] <krb> and then put it all in stocks
[15:12:03] * arryana shrugs
[15:12:07] <arryana> i don't know anything about that.
[15:12:10] <krb> he would probably be a wealthy guy now
[15:12:50] <krb> so now he rents a tiny room that the doesn't even own
[15:12:54] <krb> instead of buying a large house
[15:13:34] <krb> and he explains it as he doesn't trust banks for some reasons
[15:14:07] <krb> but he's now nearing 50 years old. how is he suppose to build himself something. if he just throws away everything
[15:14:14] <arryana> haha
[15:14:28] <arryana> i'm north of 50, so it doesn't seem quite so old to me.  but it's awfully late to start.
[15:14:33] <arryana> it depends what he wants out of life.
[15:15:03] <krb> not sure if he wants anything in this life
[15:15:51] <krb> i believe he want to show us that he's better than us capitalists somehow
[15:16:03] <arryana> haha
[15:16:10] <sweetsymph> My theory is to really encourage them with whatever interests they have, if they trains, lots of books on trains railway museums, if they like science go with it let them explore all kinds of books, science museums, experiments at home, let them build up to advanced text through their own keen interest then it was fun and by the time they are studying it at school they already have a good base knowledge or even advanced
[15:16:10] <sweetsymph> knowledge of their subjects
[15:16:11] <arryana> best of luck to him.
[15:16:41] <arryana> that's very much the montessori idea of learning

[15:23:41] <arryana> i think kids fail to learn emotional regulation when they're exposed too much to screens
[15:23:44] <arryana> and adults forget theirs
[15:25:14] <Delf> Emotional regulation?
[15:25:46] <arryana> yeah. patience, the ability to deal with frustration, the ability to think creatively instead of be fretful with boredom
[15:26:11] <arryana> dealing with all the feelings which are part of daily life when one isn't numbed with entertainment input.
[15:27:11] <Delf> Shit... I think I just skipped all of that
[15:27:27] <Delf> And cheated my way through
[15:27:46] <arryana> nobody cheats it.
[15:28:03] <arryana> that's like thinking that playing video games where you can run for miles means you can do it in real life.
[15:28:43] <arryana> it gives the illusion of that ability, but none of the real thing.

[15:33:31] <Delf> You detach or rather, divorce your emotions and feelings
[15:34:12] <Delf> You'll still have emotions... most of them, probably not all of them, but that's not an issue
[15:35:17] * arryana shrugs
[15:35:31] <arryana> i dunno how it works for other people.
[15:35:58] <arryana> emotions have their place.  they just have no business running the show.
[15:36:16] <Delf> Depends on the kind of show, but yea, that's right most of the time
[15:37:31] <Delf> When you don't feel anything at all, when you have no emotions... and you manage to take notice, by accident, you're still you, then you'll know you've never been your emotions, you've just had them and.. kind of went along with it
[15:37:34] <pussipupu> That's interesting, to be emotion is absolutely core to being as a person
[15:37:53] <Delf> I'm no less of a person than you! But nice try
[15:38:32] * arryana pushes a tea to pussipupu
[15:38:55] <arryana> i think being unaware of your emotions is not the same thing as not having them.
[15:41:00] <Delf> Agreed
[15:41:30] <pussipupu> I definitely wasn't saying you were
[15:41:56] <pussipupu> But I don't know what it would mean to be without emotions
[15:43:26] <Delf> Thing is, the less emotions you have, the less you notice not having them
[15:43:55] <Delf> The more you have, the more you notice having them
[15:44:39] <arryana> i have trouble buying that as the case, unless i see that same person without their numbing distractions.

[15:45:25] <Delf> Careful with what?
[15:45:35] <Delf> There is depersionalization disorder too
[15:45:41] <arryana> drugs, alcohol, screens, even extreme exercise
[15:45:54] <arryana> people have all sorts of numbing agents so they don't have to deal with their real feelings
[15:46:23] <Delf> Oh you mean like that
[15:48:30] <arryana> tried going without your distractions for a day, a week?
[15:50:51] <Delf> I think it's my emotions that're afraid of me rather than the other way around
[15:52:18] <arryana> haha.  i don't believe that for a minute
[15:52:34] <Delf> Come on... why would I ever lie about such a thing?
[15:54:25] <Delf> You don't need to believe it. But could you at least consider the possibility of it?
[15:55:10] <arryana> nope.  i know nonsense when i hear it.
[15:56:08] <Delf> Ehh.. that kind of fucks it up for us then
[15:56:28] <Delf> It's a what they call, a deal breaker.
[15:57:46] * arryana shrugs
[15:58:00] <arryana> i don't see a reason to discard my integrity for your insecurity
[16:00:02] <Delf> My insecurity? Ok, I will pretend to have those. But what's that got to do with your integrity?
[16:00:15] <arryana> hahaha
[16:00:43] <arryana> you're asking me to consider nonsense to be valid.  my own sense of honesty and integrity forbids that,
[16:01:18] <Delf> Right! That's how you see it. That makes sense, I suppose
[16:02:24] <Delf> I said consider the possibility. That's different than asking you consider something to be valid
[16:02:49] <Delf> I can't ask you to do that... Well I could, but I won't
[16:05:44] <Delf> The cause could be; alien unicorn abducted me and did some things to my brains. Or... maybe I have a brain tumor or something
[16:06:31] <arryana> neither is very likely
[16:06:52] <Delf> Malnutrition during development? Devils? Blessed by jesus?
[16:07:02] <Delf> What's the most likely?
[16:08:09] <arryana> you wouldn't like the answer.
[16:08:32] <Delf> Why? You made sure I wouldn't? :D
[16:09:07] <Delf> It's alright, it's not your job to spare my feelings
[16:09:34] <Delf> We are both grown ups. We can handle disagreements
[16:09:35] <arryana> because the answer is insufficient emotional maturity.  the fact that you'd reach so far as unicorns and aliens instead says pretty much all of it.
[16:10:00] <arryana> but we're all works in progress.  i've never yet met a finished person
[16:10:00] <Delf> You didn't find it funny?
[16:10:41] * arryana shrugs
[16:10:53] <Delf> Actually, I shouldn't make fun of it. Now that I think of it, people have said to have traumatizing experience from being abducted by aliens
[16:11:46] <Delf> If they say they've been abducted, I'll have to take their word for it
[16:11:57] <Delf> I haven't btw, at least not that I can remember
[16:14:27] <arryana> i feel badly for people who are in such a state that they believe things like that
[16:16:12] <Delf> I feel badly for them irrespective what they believe
[16:17:14] <Delf> It could be their brains tried to explain the trauma they went through... or they actually got abducted by aliens. We're not on speaking terms so I can't ask them either
[16:19:31] <Delf> Not on speaking terms with the aliens. Of course I'm on speaking terms with people who got abducted
[16:20:49] <arryana> i can't say i've ever met one, nor expect to
[16:21:19] <Delf> Oh you probably have, they just haven't shared it with you
[16:22:06] <Delf> It's not a casual chat topic exactly. They're usually very personal and devastating
[16:22:43] <Delf> Worst part is... I don't know what to tell them to make them feel better
[16:23:28] <Delf> What comforts me does not always comfort others. I say.. there's ALWAYS worse, no matter how bad.
[16:27:45] <arryana> no, i don't believe aliens have any interest in people.  and i certainly don't believe they're abducting people.
[16:28:11] <Delf> From what I know about space travel... You don't need humans for anything
[16:31:26] <Ungwelian> In comparative religion in uni, alien abductions and "ufology" was the topic of one course.
[16:32:03] <Ungwelian> The lecturer also said, that these occasions can be devastating for the people involved.
[16:32:18] <Delf> See! I told you!
[16:33:19] <Ungwelian> There was some talk if the abductions actually happened. But what wasn't questioned was that something did.
[16:33:51] <Ungwelian> One possible explanation was that the abductions were instead major religious experiences.
[16:34:42] <Ungwelian> Often the stories of them were fairly unclear. Such as, there being a bright light, loss of memory, so on.
[16:34:59] <Ungwelian> And the person interpreted that as alien abduction afterwards.
[16:35:50] <Ungwelian> However, it was also pointed out that these abduction stories peaked around the time when X-files aired :P
[16:36:22] <Ungwelian> Then again, that doesn't necessarily mean that nothing happened.
[16:36:25] <Delf> So they used the tv show as cloak, big deal
[16:38:25] <Delf> Can you even imagine, what I'd have to know, in order to determine if it's possible or not? I can't, it hurts my brains to try to imagine it
[16:39:09] <Ungwelian> Yeah. I think it does no harm to have an open mind, just as long as you still maintain healthy boundaries :)
[16:39:22] <Delf> Yes, don't get too close

[17:18:43] <arryana> good luck with that
[17:18:50] <Delf> What, I'm doing great so far?
[17:19:01] <Delf> Whenever I failed, I've asked for help and you've clarified
[17:19:22] <Ungwelian> I_Am_M00t, it's pure gold :D
[17:19:32] <Ungwelian> There are such nuggets.
[17:19:39] <arryana> people can understand each other's viewpoints in a context.  i don't believe most people ever understand each other much further than that
[17:19:46] <Ungwelian> "The Fascist octopus has sung its swan song"
[17:19:49] <arryana> and in the few cases it does occur, it's from long term deep sharing of lives.
[17:23:34] <Delf> There are other ways. And no, I'm not a telepathetic and if I was I'd never admit it.
[17:23:58] * arryana shrugs
[17:24:09] <Delf> You said it yourself, you're simple. Me... I'm even more simple
[17:24:46] <arryana> there are a number of people in my world that i could speak for in certain circumstance, because i know them well enough. but i would never cage them as static creatures by thinking i understand everything about them.  everyone learns and changes daily, if they live a life of any scope
[17:25:15] <Delf> Of course, they evolve
[17:26:01] <Delf> You just need to get them to confess their values and their relationship to themselves, their sense of self, their sense of identity and that's it
[17:26:20] <arryana> haha
[17:26:55] <Delf> What they think they are, in relation to their value will more or less define their judgment
[17:27:00] <arryana> i don't assess such things by what people say, but by what they do.
[17:27:44] <Delf> Exactly, it's a confession made by action rather than empty words

[17:28:23] <arryana> talk is cheap.
[17:28:27] <Delf> Their sense of self will give you deep clues for whether or not they're being honest
[17:28:32] <Delf> Indeed it is
[17:28:40] <arryana> but more than that, people are different with almost everyone they know.  people inhabit more than one role.
[17:28:55] <arryana> who they are to me does not mean that's who they -are-.  and i don't expect it to be.
[17:29:17] <Delf> Especially when they're perfectly "partitioned" the way I am
[17:30:08] <arryana> haha
[17:30:13] <Delf> Multiple Personality Order. Heard of it? It's my gig
[17:31:02] <arryana> i have a friend of 30 years with multiple personality.  i very much doubt he would say he was 'perfectly partitioned', though
[17:31:42] <Delf> Has it caused them problems?
[17:32:34] <arryana> oh yes
[17:32:41] <Delf> My condolences
[17:32:52] <arryana> any number of them, though he's found a road that's made him reasonably happy
[17:33:12] <Delf> That's great I suppose
[17:34:10] <Delf> So it has become less of a disorder and more of an order
[17:34:24] * arryana shrugs
[17:34:38] <arryana> i wouldn't be the one to define it, he'd have to speak for himself on that.
[17:35:14] <Delf> Well, if it's caused him problem, to begin with, it sounds like a disorder
[17:36:12] <Delf> And finding a road that's made him reasonable happy... might be an indication of order. But what do I know. I never had the multiple personality disorder
[17:36:16] <arryana> he has not been on an involuntary psych hold for quite a few years now.  that was not true when we were young.
[17:36:34] <arryana> he holds a good job, manages his life and his friendships.
[17:36:51] <Delf> I see... they tried to put me into one, but I couldn't stop laughing and they didn't get why... and I had to explain that it's not necessary
[17:37:04] <arryana> he has more good days than bad ones, and that makes him as functional as most, from where i sit
[17:37:44] <Delf> Does he happen to be a fantastical thinker?
[17:37:58] <arryana> no
[17:38:08] <arryana> his issues stemmed from a childhood event
[17:38:30] <arryana> when he was a kid his father came home with the intention of killing him and his mother, and he watched his mother shoot his father in the face.
[17:38:50] <arryana> he had a long road coming back from that.
[17:38:51] <Delf> My condolences
[17:38:59] * arryana shrugs
[17:39:11] <arryana> he'd undoubtedly say that it led him to have the varied life he's had
[17:39:22] <arryana> i doubt he'd see it as a tragedy, especially on this side of it

[19:00:38] <Delf> Not all of it. There was some about unicorns, alien abductions, emotions, identity, goals with vague definitions I have, such as self-definition and full autonomy
[19:00:54] <biys> I_Am_M00t: you're an-cap?
[19:01:10] <biys> isn't that an anarchist capitalist line of thinking?
[19:01:30] <arryana> that depends, moot.  is it okay with you if other working people take what's yours?
[19:01:33] <I_Am_M00t> the government, free contraceptives, but not free gum... this is hatred towards the white man
