[01:12:16] <aruns> Hi all, I am trying to write a Thunderbird add-on, and am following their quickstart guide on https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/mailextensions/hello-world-add-on, but my JS script is getting blocked due to their Content Security Policy ("Content Security Policy: The page's settings blocked the loading of a resource at inline ("default-src")." is what I get in the Thunderbird DevTools console).
[01:12:22] <aruns> I am running Thunderbird 78.12.0 (the latest available version) on Win 10 Pro, and if I click on any link in the DevTools console, I get "Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: window.top.openWebLinkIn is not a function". Anyone know how I can resolve this?

[02:32:38] <blahboybaz> I'm a little stumped on how to implement a certain jest test. I've tried the solutions I've seen (google) but it isn't working for me; and, perhaps more importantly, I'm concerned that even if they did they may not yeild a very solid test anyway.
[02:34:32] <blahboybaz> I have a print method (printNode()) that has one branch and in both code blocks it just prints to the console using console.log(). I tried using spyOn and jest.fn() but neither have yelded any success. In addition I want it to be clear that the subject is the method I'm testing (not some global namespace or something).
[02:34:42] <blahboybaz> Any ideas how this could be done?

[02:38:36] <eyynet4> so your test framework is not working
[02:38:40] <blahboybaz> I still need to write a test for it in jest tho
[02:38:40] <eyynet4> as expected
[02:38:47] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: this is the case where your code has dependency on external (builtin) function - console.log. This is the classic case for a mock
[02:39:29] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: alternatively you can do the overengineerd thing an abstract away the logging functionality into separate class/function
[02:40:20] <pyzozord> you don't need to actually do a console.log in your jest test. You just need to make sure that anything called "console.log" is called
[02:40:21] <blahboybaz> ok
[02:40:22] <eyynet4> can you do something other than console.log?
[02:40:34] <blahboybaz> I don't think I know how to access console.log() in a way that it is definitely coming from my method (not the global window or something)
[02:40:48] <blahboybaz> eyynet4: I'm not changing my menhod

[06:23:53] <______GOD______> "make an array, then turn that into a binary tree that is flipped and then turn that into an array and then unmake that array, then pat head while rubbing stomach, then stand on head, then jump up and down"
[06:24:06] <AlexDelarge> lol we did that in high school
[06:24:52] <edgar-rft> ______GOD______: I have a PhD in nose-digging and ass-scratching for things like that
[06:25:04] <______GOD______> There is probably a japanese programmer somewhere laughing..."haha...those gaijin won't know WTF was being asked to be done"
[06:25:22] <AlexDelarge> over in ##electronics we figured out that ______DOG______ is a 13 year old student who has issues at school
[06:25:47] <______GOD______> "simply make it lots of confusing things in a row in the same exercise"
[06:26:29] <edgar-rft> that's the whole point of exercises

[10:28:42] <blahboybaz> There's still something I don't get about the implementation of a jest test.. If I do  jest.spyOn(console, "log", "printNode");  then arent I just capturing anything that is logged to the console without any regard to who / what the caller is? In other words, isn't there some way to tie what is being spied on to the specific method that contains the call to console.log()?
[10:29:22] *** Quits: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[10:29:29] <blahboybaz> excuse me, that was a typo.. should have been  jest.spyOn(console, "log");
[10:30:10] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Spying on console.log itself is tricky, that method has...    Some historical quirks.  You may want to consider locating a logger that lets you control the output better.

[10:34:34] <Arahael> blahboybaz: What you want is to be able to intercept logs from a very specific unit.
[10:35:01] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Intercepting console.log indeed does not discriminate - it'll intercept all messages from all units.
[10:35:03] <blahboybaz> Yes, I want to know that the output is coming from the subject
[10:35:17] <blahboybaz> ahh
[10:35:40] <Arahael> blahboybaz: That requires the logger to somehow know what is doing the logging.
[10:35:54] <blahboybaz> So it's a problem with console.log() an there is not better way to write a test that accomplises the disered result?
[10:36:16] <blahboybaz> Maybe jest could be coded to do the knowing tho
[10:36:57] <Arahael> blahboybaz: Your unit will need to use an alternative logger, and then yes, indeed, jest could intercept _that_ logger.
[10:38:14] <blahboybaz> ok, so then I need to comprehend what an "alternative logger" means when I have little understanding of logger (what that is even). Alls I know is you type comsole.log("stuff") and it prints shit to the console. That's as far as I got
[10:38:44] <blahboybaz> More specifically.. little understanding of how a logger works

[12:22:37] <usr123> I'm reading "Elements of programming interviews". I'm trying to understand how to solve buy and sell stock twice in the book. Basically given a range of stock prices, if we can make two buy and sell transactions where sell occurs after buy and second buy occurs after sell, find the maximum profit. Here is the solution mentioned in the
[12:22:37] <usr123> book:https://imgur.com/a/MgUluQ6 https://imgur.com/a/MgUluQ6
[12:22:49] <usr123> n the solution, I don't understand why is it that we're calculating the max profit backwards and why we're combining the two, and how does M[i] = F[i-1] + B[i] actually combine the two?

[13:08:36] <akronymus> XML is a strict subset of sgml afaik
[13:09:42] <mrig> It is that it can be used other than </normal> that adds a level of complexity right at the root of the language.

[13:10:17] *** Joins: koo6 (~koo6@89-24-13-235.customers.tmcz.cz)
[13:10:57] <akronymus> I personally think that self closing tags overall are a benefit.
[13:11:33] <akronymus> Many times the tag itself is used for indicating some property.
[13:11:34] <mrig> Ah such as the <p> tags in HTML?
[13:11:45] <akronymus> Yeah.
[13:11:50] <mrig> that do not require closing.
[13:12:07] <mrig> It must depend upon the use case I suppose.
[13:12:17] <akronymus> Pretty sure they technically do require closing.
[13:12:28] <mrig> When writing parser it is a pain.
[13:12:36] <akronymus> Just html parsers are REALLY lax with enforcing the correctness.
[13:12:54] <mrig> well if it is being closed, that must be a meta specification of the parser :|

[13:14:20] <lockywolf> what's wrong with first expanding the tags, during the first pass?
[13:14:25] <akronymus> IMO that added complexity is worth it IMO.
[13:14:31] <lockywolf> <p/> -> <p></p>
[13:14:38] <akronymus> Because you can do it like lockywolf said
[13:15:29] <akronymus> Or just add a entry that holds no data for the self closing tag.
[13:15:36] <lockywolf> I mean, that is one more pass through the file...
[13:15:44] <akronymus> Not really.
[13:15:44] <mrig> well what is wrong is that which I just mentioned above, complexity right at the root.
[13:15:54] <akronymus> You need to have the open tags cached anyways.
[13:15:59] <lockywolf> when your files are gigabytes long, it is a bit slow
[13:16:10] <mrig> exponential growth being what it is, its perhaps not the best place for it :)

[13:17:13] <lockywolf> it is much better than permitting tags that are "allowed to not be closed"
[13:17:17] <mrig> sure no, it is just that it makes writing the parser more complicated.

[13:18:03] <mrig> which is what I'm grumbling about, but your highlighting of this sax or dom difference has shed a lot of light upon what I'm trying to do.
[13:18:16] <akronymus> "/>" and "</tag>"  are functionally equivalent.
[13:18:26] <lockywolf> (jokingly, one or two passes do not matter in terms of complexity)
[13:18:32] <mrig> which is great, thanks; I think this helps me enormously in thinking about how to lay out my code.
[13:19:06] <akronymus> Also: The stack can literally be a single stack.
[13:19:46] <mrig> The next lecture that I have to watch on computation theory covers the stack I think; I must get on and finish that.
[13:19:50] <akronymus> You just give each element a collection of children and when you close a tag, you put that tag as one of the children.

[15:41:00] <mickey> data will need to be reduced after a while too, which is common feature of these databases, like after a year all data of every day will be averaged and saved as one point
[15:42:54] <akronymus> Are you talking a lot as in hundreds of k a day or millions an hour?
[15:43:11] <akronymus> Because the former should be able to be handled by most db's.

[17:04:29] <Lyn> what's the difference between ignoring **/node_modules/ and node_modules/ ? SO answers didn't explain how the latter is inferior
[17:05:24] <Guest89> "**/<pattern" is recursive
[17:05:36] <Guest89> so the first would match `node_modules` inside any nested directories
[17:05:55] <Lyn> these answers let me understand that the latter does the same
[17:06:11] <Guest89> Just node_modules/ alone? I don't think so
[17:06:32] <Lyn> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29820791/git-ignore-node-modules-folder-everywhere the one with 1020 votes
[17:06:33] <Guest89> meaning that if you have a structure like foo, foo/bar, foo/bar/baz and you have `node_modules` inside each of these directories
