[03:16:20] <martian67> those artifacts have never shown to be flutes!

[03:16:43] <martian67> it was just an assumption

[17:44:30] <gerikson> hi mouseghost
[17:44:52] <mouseghost> whats up, gerikson?
[17:45:08] <gerikson> Sunday afternoon
[17:45:13] <mouseghost> mm
[17:45:15] <gerikson> I've mowed the lawn
[17:45:19] <gerikson> tried to make mayo
[17:45:30] <gerikson> but it won't emulsify correctly :(
[17:45:30] <mouseghost> why mayo?
[17:45:42] <gerikson> part of the recipe for tonight
[17:45:47] <mouseghost> how short do you mow the lawn?
[17:45:48] <mouseghost> oh!
[17:45:56] <mouseghost> would love to help, but i know nothing about cooking haha
[17:46:21] <gerikson> poached salmon: https://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-main-courses/184-salmon-cold-poached

[19:21:35] <quanticle> Xe: Good post (as usual) about Android vs. iOS. I just have one thing to add. The thing that keeps me on Android is the fact that I can swap out the launcher for something like Nova Launcher. And that's important, because Nova Launcher allows me to hide addictive apps (like Youtube, or even Chrome) behind a PIN code. Kind of like putting a lock on the refrigerator when you want to go on a
[19:21:37] <quanticle> diet. It forces you to stop and think, "Do I really *need* to use this app, or am I just launching it because I'm bored?" And iOS has literally nothing like that and its entire design philosophy (Papa Jobs knows best) is against that sort of customization.
[19:22:16] <quanticle> So while I accept all the criticisms of Android... it remains that it allows me to have the one bit of customization I want, and iOS doesn't.
[19:25:05] <mouseghost> with the seats with the small table on the right in schools etc: are there a few symmetrical ones or are all on the right side in your schools? hm
[19:27:10] <quanticle> mouseghost: Ours had a few where the small table was on the left, but they were never marked
[19:27:22] <mouseghost> marked..? quanticle
[19:27:22] <quanticle> So occasionally, as a right hander, you'd get a left-handed table
[19:27:47] <quanticle> And I suppose the left-handers had to figure out where the left-handed tables were on their own
[19:28:29] <quanticle> We never had any that were symmetric. They were all either right-handed or left-handed.
[19:41:12] <mouseghost> :/
