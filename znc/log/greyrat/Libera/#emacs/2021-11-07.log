[03:30:36] <Spawns_Carpeting> yeah my CPU has 72MB l3 cache lol

[04:45:55] <bpalmer> In theory, seq.el supports arbitrary (user-defined) sequence types
[04:46:28] <bpalmer> all of its functions are generic and it lists which methods have to implemented for a type to be a fully custom sequence
[04:47:00] <bpalmer> (to respond to a previous thread on seq vs mapcar)
[04:47:34] <Catie> Okay, so it is that seq-map is more generic! Mapcar just works on vectors for some reason

[04:50:46] <bpalmer> namely, (seq-map #'1+ [1 2 3]) returns a list, not a vector.
[04:51:13] <bpalmer> You can't complain when mapcar does it, because mapcar working on a vector is like a dog playing chess.
[04:51:52] <Catie> Oh I see. Yeah, you would think that it would have a result of the same type as the input sequence
[04:51:57] <zebrag> `(insert (propertize "to insert" 'face '(:height 2.0)))` and `(insert "to insert")` give the same result.

[05:33:25] <johnjay> or edebug. whatever it's called
[05:34:29] <Spawns_Carpeting> why is the cdr of the return value of assoc a deeply nested list in this case? i thought it would be only the list itself
[05:34:41] <Spawns_Carpeting> yeah that really confused me johnjay lol
[05:35:05] <Catie> Well, the whole thing's a pretty heavily nested list

[05:35:50] <Catie> and several key-value pairs are grouped by a call to list

[05:36:47] <Spawns_Carpeting> I thought that would return field-a?
[05:38:08] <johnjay> use C-x C-e to eval the expression from inner to outer
[05:38:16] <johnjay> you see that the final result then is not actually an alist
[05:38:24] <johnjay> highlight paren mode helps with this
[05:38:52] <johnjay> well it sort of is an alist. just not the one you wanted
[05:38:54] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpet: perhaps you're looking for cadr , not cdr ?
[05:39:18] <bpalmer> but yeah, evaluate from inside to out ; if it gets confusing, use let* to break it down individually
[05:39:18] <Spawns_Carpeting> oh yeah bpalmer that worked

[05:40:12] <bpalmer> cadr is equivalent to second .  (cadr '(1 2)) => 2  
[05:40:18] <johnjay> it's an inherently subjective statement which conceals a lot of assumptions

[05:41:21] <Spawns_Carpeting> thanks
[05:41:59] <Catie> Generally key-value pairs are conses rather than lists, which is why (cdr (assoc ...)) is the usual idiom
[05:42:38] <johnjay> you mean dotted pairs?
[05:42:41] <Spawns_Carpeting> isn't that a plist Catie ?
[05:43:06] <Spawns_Carpeting> i thought it was but I think I am wrong about that now
[05:43:13] <Catie> johnjay: pretty much, yeah. Dotted pair is how a cons cell is represented
[05:43:16] <johnjay> (eq '(cons 1 (cons 2 nil)) '(1 . 2) )
[05:43:36] <johnjay> (eq (cons 1 (cons 2 nil)) '(1 . 2) )

[05:44:21] <Catie> That comes back as nil though
[05:44:22] <johnjay> Catie: when the manual says dotted pair i though it means an expression like (1 . 2) where the cdr is not itself a cons. as opposed to (list 1 2)
[05:45:05] <Catie> Right, so a single dotted pair is one cons cell

[05:46:47] <johnjay> hmm. the manual i googled says that dotted pair is simply a different way of notating a cons cell
[05:47:31] <Spawns_Carpeting> i thought a list and a cons were the same thing
[05:47:50] <johnjay> no
[05:47:55] <Spawns_Carpeting> is the cons version supposed to be how an alist is created?
[05:47:59] <johnjay> a list is a nil-terminated cons
[05:48:09] <johnjay> > When printing a list, the dotted pair notation is only used if the CDR of a cons cell is not a list.
[05:48:16] <Catie> johnjay: I think we're arguing the same point, I'm just doing a bad job of wording it
[05:48:25] <johnjay> sort of like a sequence of chars in C is not a string if there's no \0 at the end
[05:48:30] <johnjay> but to a person it's still a string
[05:48:36] <Spawns_Carpeting> okay that example makes sense johnjay 
[05:48:50] <johnjay> the real reason is probably something to do with recursion
[05:48:57] <johnjay> when recursing over a list you have to have a termination condition

[05:49:26] *** Joins: darkstarx (~darkstard@gateway/vpn/pia/darkstardevx)
[05:50:08] <johnjay> in the case of an alist there's no need to recurse generally so the last cell is used for a value not nil
[05:50:35] <zebrag> I understand no one is using sublimity or minimap?
[05:50:49] <johnjay> i.e. elements look like (cons 1 2), not (cons 1 (cons 2 nil))
[05:51:08] <Catie> Yeah, in the case of the alist, each cons cell is being used to store a value instead of represent a list. But the outer list is a proper list that ends with nil
[05:51:20] <johnjay> correct yes
[05:51:36] <johnjay> the cons cell is basically like a struct with 2 pointer in it
[05:51:49] <johnjay> probably literally if you look at the C code of emacs
[05:52:17] <Catie> The C code of most Lisp implementations, yeah
[05:52:45] <Catie> Though there's been limited support for unboxing certain types through the years
[05:52:59] <johnjay> so it's basically like using the 2nd pointer for a int or float instead of pointing to another cons struct
[05:53:30] <johnjay> but obviously if you don't intend to do that and your code is recursive you run into rpoblems
[05:53:34] <johnjay> hence all the stuff about boxes and alist
[05:53:52] <Catie> Yeah, I know under a lot of Lisps if you do, for example, length on an improper list it chokes
[05:54:08] <bpalmer> see safe-length
[05:54:55] <johnjay> probably again for the obvious reason. if you need to get the length of a linked list you recurse on it until the end.

[09:31:36] <StarOnD> Hello everyone, I am reading this >>> https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html . It says : If you make a mistake typing the search string, type DEL (isearch-delete-char). Each DEL cancels the last input item entered during the search. However, DEL is not working, instead BACKSPACE is doing the described job of DEL. I wonder why that is.
[09:33:21] <StarOnD> can someone please clarify my confusion
[09:36:46] <aidalgol> bpalmer: It's a common trope in JRPGs for the final boss to be a god.
[09:39:56] <bpalmer> sometimes it seems like there's a difference between fighting god and fighting a god.
[09:40:52] <bpalmer> StarOnD: often they're mapped to one another
[09:41:11] <bpalmer> StarOnD: if you're in isearch , type C-h k BS   (that is, the backspace key) and you'll see it's mapped to the documented function.
[09:43:04] <StarOnD> bpalmer, thank you. By mapped to one another you mean they are interchanged? 
[09:43:14] <StarOnD> DEL and BACKSPACE?

[09:50:20] <StarOnD> bpalmer, I get this when I do C-h k BS >>> DEL (translated from <backspace>) runs the command
[09:50:20] <StarOnD> delete-backward-char (found in global-map), which is an interactive
[09:50:20] <StarOnD> compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.
[09:50:20] <StarOnD> It is bound to DEL.
[09:50:20] <StarOnD> (delete-backward-char N &optional KILLFLAG)
[09:50:21] <StarOnD> This function is for interactive use only;
[09:50:23] <StarOnD> in Lisp code use ‘delete-char’ instead.
[09:50:25] <StarOnD> :around advice: ‘ad-Advice-delete-backward-char’
[09:50:27] <StarOnD> Delete the previous N characters (following if N is negative).
[09:50:29] <StarOnD> If Transient Mark mode is enabled, the mark is active, and N is 1,
[09:50:31] <StarOnD> delete the text in the region and deactivate the mark instead.
[09:50:33] <StarOnD> To disable this, set option ‘delete-active-region’ to nil.
[09:50:35] <StarOnD> Optional second arg KILLFLAG, if non-nil, means to kill (save in
[09:50:39] <StarOnD> kill ring) instead of delete.  Interactively, N is the prefix
[09:50:41] <StarOnD> arg, and KILLFLAG is set if N is explicitly specified.
[09:50:43] <StarOnD> When killing, the killed text is filtered by
[09:50:45] <StarOnD> ‘filter-buffer-substring’ before it is saved in the kill ring, so
[09:50:47] <StarOnD> the actual saved text might be different from what was killed.
[09:50:49] <StarOnD> In Overwrite mode, single character backward deletion may replace
[09:50:51] <StarOnD> tabs with spaces so as to back over columns, unless point is at
[09:50:53] <StarOnD> the end of the line.
[09:50:55] <StarOnD> [back]
[09:50:57] <StarOnD> My apologies for the flooding
