[07:30:43] <sd> 08<G​ene> pretty much tech talent is lacking in my area, if a key tech gets hit by a bus, there's an issue finding a replacement
[07:31:04] <arlion> we used datadog for 2 months. It ended up costing us millions that we immediately turned it off
[07:31:24] <riff-IRC> yikes

[07:31:51] <arlion> AND FLUENTD HATES NESTED FUCKING JSON
[07:32:06] <arlion> that's what i was orginally ranting about that brought on this entire conversation
[07:32:07] <riff-IRC> we fired a client in 1989 when they refused to let us repair their absolutely atrocious switchgear room
[07:32:30] <arlion> and then Gene said logging to redis and i've just gone about to eat my a bullet

[10:32:58] <Hunterkll> we have a maintenance contract/company for them, but for the most part, except routine scheduled (reccomended by xerox) maint (occasional roller, belt, whatever), it's just to come in to empty the waste toner bins every so often

[10:33:31] <Hunterkll> great for printing book-amount of pages that we spiral bind ourselves for workshop manuals and shit for client sites

[10:53:27] <Hunterkll> here's an FM transmitter kit that does 40kW in a single 19" rack - https://305broadcast.com/products/50-kw-fm-transmitter-swap-series
[10:53:54] <Hunterkll> i mean shit, at home i have a 2KW amplifier that's basically just a network-rack deep 4U sized unit, and that's *vacuum tube* based
[10:54:01] <Hunterkll> with built in AC converting power supply
[10:56:44] <Hunterkll> this one company sells a 50KW AM amplifier that's not even a half rack

[11:00:01] <Hunterkll> that and the transmitter vehicle only needs enough room/accses for maintenance/repairs since it'd be completely unmanned
[11:00:09] <Hunterkll> only people inside the command module, remote equipment monitoring, etc

[11:24:26] <Hunterkll> certs autorenew just fine...
[11:24:34] <Hunterkll> and it's a yubikey so it's not likethey're carrying around a card reader or anything
[11:24:56] <Hunterkll> plus they can use the yubikey's other functions for project related stuff too instead of having multiple tokens
[11:25:13] <Hunterkll> but primarily, we give users yubikeys issued as PIV-compliant smartcards
[11:25:36] <Hunterkll> less moving parts to break, far more reliable, works 100% offline reliably without any timeouts/cached data, etc
[11:25:50] <Hunterkll> and, as above, the only real native integrated MFA that isn't bypassable via a variety of tricks
[11:26:41] <Hunterkll> your machine could be offline, or our CA and AD could be down, for about a year and some change, before any of our users had a single issue beyond PIN resets, which we only need the CMS for, not the rest of the infra 
[11:28:11] <Hunterkll> compared to any other MFA system i've used, it's the only really seemless reliable one i've found.... RSA, Duo, Authy, etc
[11:29:07] <Hunterkll> it also doesn't require the back end to shove psswords down to agents and shit
[11:29:11] <Hunterkll> because there are no passwords :D
[11:29:20] <Hunterkll> ... or agents

[12:06:30] <kerat58> What is the backup of a Yubikey, Hunterkll?  Do you just keep a duplicate Yubi device in a safe place?
[12:07:00] <kerat58> Like, for example, I'm crossing the street, drop it, and right that second a car zooms by and crushes it
[12:07:51] <nobyk> You'll have to be rehired or get another job
[12:08:47] <kerat58> hahaha
[12:09:13] <xe0n> you replace it?
[12:09:27] <nobyk> Can probably just asign another
[12:09:34] <nobyk> Or something
[12:09:40] <kerat58> yeah I guess my question was more along the lines of: if the emergnecy recovery works like authy, wherein, you have a list of backup codes for each site/service
[12:09:44] <Activ8> Another day in paradise
[12:09:48] <nobyk> like you change an MFA method for m365
[12:10:26] <kerat58> I may get one and start winding down my Authy usage and switching to a Yubiy key where possible.

[12:10:46] <kerat58> Ideally, attaching it to a retractable landyard so that it can be dramatically taken out and plugged in whenever something important is about to happen
[12:17:02] <Hunterkll> right?
[12:17:48] <Hunterkll> kerat58: in this case, we can remotely disable the smartcard only login on a mac as long as you can connect to the internet from the login screen, and you can use the password you set up for the initial user creation of the account (Required for keychain functions, etc)
[12:17:57] <Hunterkll> kerat58: in the case of any other high secure system, you're fucked
[12:18:04] <Hunterkll> and you come get a new one
[12:18:07] <Hunterkll> so we can revoke the old one
[12:18:09] <Hunterkll> well
[12:18:11] <Hunterkll> we'll revoke first
[12:18:43] <Hunterkll> kerat58: but also, I can issue multiple tokens to the same person, and since it's based on certificate CN/UPN, all tokens act as the same 
[12:18:48] <Hunterkll> if they're that important 
[12:19:00] <Hunterkll> but yea, otherwise, we're just overnighting you a new token 
[12:19:26] <Hunterkll> we're hoping to eventually get rid of the ability to even do that smartcard-less login at some point in the future
[12:19:53] <Hunterkll> because right now the macOS procedure is user creates local account -> enforcement kicks in -> they pair token -> machine is now locked down 
[12:20:02] <Hunterkll> but that' paired token ' is based on certian attriibutes in the certificate 
[12:20:15] <Hunterkll> so any token works that's issued to that user account, not a 1:1 pairing 
[12:22:06] <DrZak> lol
[12:22:18] <DrZak> apple tries to make a networked operating system
[12:23:14] <Hunterkll> Hm?
[12:23:22] <Hunterkll> From its core it's built ground up to be a network operating system just like sun
[12:23:28] <Hunterkll> ever since 1987
[12:23:38] <DrZak> yea, but not to work with regular users 
[12:23:39] <DrZak> :D
[12:23:44] <Hunterkll> Eh?
[12:23:46] <Hunterkll> absolutely so
[12:23:53] <Hunterkll> it's just the way *we* have to implement it into existing environments 
[12:23:57] <DrZak> they are shoehorning user operations to a server os
[12:24:09] <Hunterkll> if i could cleanslate the environment and force reimages
[12:24:14] <Hunterkll> we'd not have any of that shenanigans
[12:24:18] <Hunterkll> user would get token, log in, walk off
[12:24:22] <Hunterkll> and that's that
[12:24:29] <Hunterkll> the network integration is fucking stellar in OS X 
[12:24:46] <DrZak> os osx can somehow get centralized settings?
[12:24:51] <Hunterkll> (that and NeXTstep was always a user OS, not a server OS) 
[12:25:00] <Hunterkll> they shoehorned it into being a server
[12:25:02] <Hunterkll> not the otherway around
[12:25:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:25:21] <Hunterkll> it was designed to rely on other vendors shit for server/network/account ops 
[12:25:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:25:31] <DrZak> what does it have from nextstep anyway, i mean, all i ever saw was fbsd
[12:25:43] <Hunterkll> .... the direct lineage?
[12:25:44] <Hunterkll> i mean
[12:25:54] <Hunterkll> it's literally NeXTstep 
[12:25:58] <Hunterkll> just with a lot of future development
[12:26:05] <Hunterkll> half the damn system APIs are still original NeXTstep APIs 
[12:26:10] <Hunterkll> it's a direct evolution of the codebase
[12:26:10] <DrZak> oooh
[12:26:11] <DrZak> ok
[12:26:30] <Hunterkll> OS X Server 1.0 was literally pretty much just a newer NeXTstep with the classic mac GUI on top
[12:26:31] <Hunterkll> lol
[12:26:37] <DrZak> so hte unix core wraped by nextstep apis
[12:26:38] <Hunterkll> and it's continued from there 
[12:26:42] <Hunterkll> ... no?
[12:26:49] <Hunterkll> what unix core
[12:27:01] <Hunterkll> yes, nextstep/OS X/macOS is a unix distro 
[12:27:06] <Hunterkll> certified, even
[12:27:12] <DrZak> the bsd-like core you see when runing console 
[12:27:15] <Hunterkll> but when you say core 
[12:27:38] <Hunterkll> are you talking about the kernel? the mach servers? the kernel personality layers for userland? the utilities/executables?
[12:27:55] <DrZak> the kernel and i suppose the mach part?
[12:27:59] <Hunterkll> because the desktop environment is just as much part of the unix system as is the commandline utilities 
[12:28:03] <DrZak> i thought all of that was a fbsd version
[12:28:21] <Hunterkll> mach servers are just microkernel services such as device drivers, I/O systems, display systems, etc running in their own isolated kernel areas 
[12:28:41] <Hunterkll> the kernel is still just the CMU Mach microkernel it was back in 1987
[12:28:42] <DrZak> ah, ok
[12:29:16] <Hunterkll> the kernel personality layer had a BSD flavor to it for syscall interfaces (which get translated to Mach functions) for ease of porting stuff that was common back then
[12:29:44] <Hunterkll> the userland utilities were originally derived from 4.3BSD (not all though)
[12:29:59] <Hunterkll> a lot is in-house developed, they just took what was easy/standard and threw it in the box too
[12:30:53] <Hunterkll> you can actually think of the OS X kernel as loosely working in a similar model as the Windows kernel 
[12:31:12] <Hunterkll> what's running in userland isn't actually native to the kernel, just like Win32 isn't actually native to the Windows kernel 
[12:32:35] <DrZak> hmm, i always thought about it differently
[12:32:37] <DrZak> ah well
[12:32:58] <Hunterkll> theoretically you could implement a Win32 kernel personality and run windows userspace on top of it(assuming you implement the appropriate Mach servers to handle NT syscalls or teach the existing ones how) and run windows userspace on mach kernel
[12:33:12] <DrZak> that sound unholy
[12:33:13] <DrZak> :)
[12:33:24] <Hunterkll> same as you could make an NT kernel subsystem that's a linux interface and run solely linux userland on top of NT kernel
[12:33:29] <Hunterkll> which... is exactly what WSL1 did
[12:33:48] <Hunterkll> WSL1 made linux equally native to Win32 at the kernel interface level, they had to create a ton of IPC shit to make the two environments talk to each other 
[12:33:57] <Hunterkll> then they gave up on that and made WSL2 and just run linux in a VM now
[12:33:58] <Hunterkll> :D

[12:35:19] <Hunterkll> theroetically you could rip out Win32 and OS/2 and be left with a unix system (obviously, you'd have to implement a lot more in the env subsystem for GUI/kernel handling/etc that win32 does but still)

[13:18:31] <Activ8> good afternoon to some
[13:19:00] <SirSceptalot> quack!
[13:19:39] <DrZak> man, m365 really need to add the option of having one domain in two+ tenants
[13:19:50] <DrZak> at least maybe as an address rewrite option
[13:20:18] <Activ8> that would come in super handy for us
[13:20:40] <DrZak> ye
[13:21:40] <Joe-Developer> what about the seals Activ8 
[13:21:43] <Activ8> we haven't done it yet but is there such thing as a tenant migration yet so accounts can be moved from one Tennent to another without using a 3rd party
[13:22:07] <Activ8> Joe-Developer - and all other wild life 
[13:22:48] <DrZak> yea, i already used that native ms tool
[13:22:50] <DrZak> its crap
[13:22:58] <DrZak> bittitan or nada
[13:23:21] <Joe-Developer> much appreciated
[13:25:06] <Hunterkll> hm
[13:25:12] <Hunterkll> there is a way to send as an address from two tenants
[13:25:51] <DrZak> hm?
[13:26:02] <DrZak> domainA is in tenantA, domainB in tenantB
[13:26:20] <DrZak> how can userA from tenantA send mail as userA@domainB ?
[13:26:26] <DrZak> EOP doesnt do address rewrite
[13:26:39] <DrZak> you would need to deploy Exchange Edge servers
[13:26:39] <Hunterkll> ah here we go, it involved hosting an exchange instance in azure to use as an edge server apparently
[13:26:40] <Hunterkll> https://mymicrosoftexchange.wordpress.com/2020/03/13/how-to-share-the-same-email-domain-between-two-exchange-online-tenants-for-long-term-mail-flow-tenant-to-tenant-coexistence-part-1/
[13:26:46] <DrZak> yea
[13:27:05] <DrZak> but in that case its cheaper to just rent a 3rd party service doing the rewriting
[13:27:13] <DrZak> (for the duration of the migration)
[13:27:37] <DrZak> and then after the migration is finished, simply remove the domainB from tenantB and add it to tenantA

[14:12:18] <lemming> fun one from work today
[14:12:39] <lemming> Shared mailbox on exchange online for one of our teams is sitting at 101GB, so they've asked us to expand it.
[14:13:02] <lemming> I pulled a report on the mailbox to see what was using the space. > 4'000'000 emails in mailbox.
[14:13:27] <lemming> but the part that really made me go WTAF?!... there's 3'597 folders in the mailbox.
[14:15:13] <Activ8> lmao
[14:15:19] <Activ8> we never expand above 50gb
[14:15:35] <Activ8> not a chance any client of ours is working on mailboxes 100gb fuck that for a laugh
[14:16:05] <Activ8> they must archive emails every year.
[14:16:45] <Activ8> some have auto archive policies attached some do manual and it's their responsibility to back them up correctly
[14:16:49] <Activ8> we don't get paid for that
[14:16:52] <Hunterkll> lemming: some kinda automation shit?
[14:17:04] <lemming> nope, 100% manual
[14:17:12] <SirSceptalot> lol
[14:17:13] <lemming> they were basically using the mailbox as a filing system.
[14:17:24] <Activ8> that's crazy
[14:17:26] <Hunterkll> i mean, for communication, they're not wrong
[14:17:28] <Hunterkll> but lol
[14:17:28] <Activ8> 2022 they need teaching
[14:17:40] <Hunterkll> need to find the maximum age they need to retain things and set a retention policy
[14:17:42] <Hunterkll> that'd fix it right up 
[14:17:44] <Activ8> our clients don't ever use email for sending files any more
[14:17:58] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i took 'filing system' as in communications, given the >4mil emails
[14:18:00] <lemming> oh they've been told, they're now going to shift everything out to a sharepoint
[14:18:06] <Activ8> good
[14:18:20] <lemming> Hunterkll, required retention period of 14 years for legal reasons.
[14:18:22] <Activ8> we have some sharepoint clients, some one drive clients and some gdrive clients
[14:18:22] <Hunterkll> my mailbox spans like ~6 years at this point 
[14:18:32] <Hunterkll> personal mailbox spans all the way back to ... 2002?
[14:18:41] <Activ8> only around 40% of our clients use network drives, that's just the ones with big nas systems on site
[14:18:45] <lemming> we've got a mix of onedrive and sharepointn Activ8
[14:18:51] <Activ8> good stuff!
[14:18:56] <lemming> generally onedrive for personal, sharepoint for shared.
[14:19:17] <Hunterkll> i still need to put in a ticket with MS to expand my personal onedrive
[14:19:21] <Hunterkll> i've almost got the 5TB limit filled up
[14:19:26] <Hunterkll> gonna ask for 25TB and move more shit into it
[14:19:27] <Activ8> I had to set up a new company share the other week for a company, was around 50 folders and the permissions was about 10 departments and 3 special case permissions
[14:19:27] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:19:39] <Activ8> tiny setups
[14:19:47] <Activ8> 25TB nice!
[14:19:52] <Hunterkll> oh fun fact: after 25TB, the 'unlimited' onedrive storage can't go past that, they start setting up 25TB SPO site collections for you 
[14:20:05] <Activ8> I assume that's big cost
[14:20:06] <lemming> my personal NAS is 80TB currently Activ8 :-P
[14:20:09] <Hunterkll> Activ8: nope
[14:20:21] <Hunterkll> Activ8: any subscription that includes unlimited onedrive & has 5 or more licenses
[14:20:21] <Activ8> what the fudge do you have on there lemming let me guess films? 
[14:20:24] <Hunterkll> i have 5 O365 E3 
[14:20:27] <BWMerlin> Unlimited*
[14:20:27] <Activ8> nice!
[14:20:29] <Hunterkll> in my account 
[14:20:35] <lemming> films and incremental backups of all my other systems
[14:20:36] <BWMerlin> *Unlimited may not actually be unlimited
[14:20:37] <Hunterkll> microsoft action pack lol
[14:20:47] <Hunterkll> BWMerlin: oh, it's theroetically unlimited, just they give you more space in different ways 
[14:20:48] <Activ8> it's nice to be able to get that
[14:20:49] <kerat58> what kind of stuff do you have?  I sync my personal home folder to the cloud but it is less than 7GB; it is mostly documents (text files; notes on how I do things etc)
[14:20:55] <Activ8> microsoft should give people more freebies I think
[14:20:56] <kerat58> 5tb is a lot for personal
[14:20:57] <kerat58> methinks
[14:21:01] <Activ8> 5tb is a lot
[14:21:02] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i pay $475/yr
[14:21:07] <Activ8> :O
[14:21:22] <Activ8> I'm still on a 1TB exthdd and 1tb cloud now I don't pay anything
[14:21:25] <Activ8> important stuff goes up
[14:21:31] <Activ8> non important stays down

[14:21:53] <Hunterkll> for that $475/yr
[14:21:56] <Activ8> I'm not a data horder though lol I don't like data
[14:22:00] <Hunterkll> and those licenses all have production use rights for internal 
[14:22:02] <Hunterkll> if you're a company
[14:22:07] <Activ8> that's pretty nice that very cheap
[14:22:31] <Hunterkll> Activ8: that, plus my personal volume license copy of windows, and other shit, basically means a large portion of the shit i run at home is actually legit licensed
[14:22:32] <Hunterkll> lol

[14:24:12] <Hunterkll> so having just 1 VL copy of server standard, means I can call into VLSC to get a KMS key (which I did) 
[14:24:20] <Hunterkll> for reimaging rights/etc doesn't matter
[14:24:29] <Activ8> sweet
[14:24:32] <Activ8> it's nice when it all works
[14:24:33] <DrZak> i really hate kms
[14:24:37] <Activ8> wouldn't like your elec bill though
[14:24:49] <Activ8> mines on a micro box as I mentioned before and it uses nothing 
[14:24:49] <Hunterkll> Activ8: family of five with pets and heavy internet users etc 
[14:24:51] <Hunterkll> :P
[14:24:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:24:53] <Activ8> very little power
[14:24:54] <DrZak> its mostly reliable, but if it doesnt work, there's almost no chance to figure out why
[14:25:14] <Activ8> I would hate to see peoples bills after the increase of gas/elec
[14:25:21] <Activ8> espc those running home labs
[14:25:31] <kerat58> heh
[14:25:39] <kerat58> we do colo in some NL-based data centres
[14:25:46] <Activ8> infact I'm suprised people don't downscale now the elec is going up
[14:26:01] <lemming> Activ8 my NAS idles on about 100w, it drops down to 40w when the drives spin down
[14:26:06] <Activ8> yeh we are about to go colo shortly
[14:26:11] <kerat58> the centre claims their energy costs have doubled, and have re-calculated the per-rack-unit rate acordingly
[14:26:19] <Activ8> we have about 50 servers ready to go into a data centre 
[14:26:27] <lemming> my VM host idles on about 20W, and tops out at 150W, my x86 router draws a whopping... 10w
[14:26:32] <Activ8> that's not bad on idle
[14:26:37] <Activ8> my idle is probably 1w
[14:26:38] <Activ8> lol
[14:27:01] <lemming> I can't get it any lower on the NAS because of the 10GBit NIC, that thing uses like 15W alone
[14:27:09] <lemming> and then the SAS card is another 10W
[14:27:20] <sd> 07<m​itchy93> So I'm trying American chocolate, it's fucking terrible
[14:27:20] <Activ8> I'm still on 1gb nic I don't use file transfer it's purely for kms + irc
[14:27:34] <Activ8> I have never had american choco
[14:27:35] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:27:41] <lemming> I like not having to wait for my file transfers :-P
[14:27:45] <Hunterkll> weird that your kms runs in a docker container
[14:27:49] <Hunterkll> i'll have to find the technet doc on how to do that
[14:27:49] <Activ8> oh and it's a web server
[14:27:50] <Hunterkll> :P
[14:27:57] <Activ8> uses linux with caddy
[14:28:01] <lemming> I also run my games library off a set of 4 1TB SSD's in RAIDZ1 via iSCSI
[14:28:11] <Activ8> I run 5 micro sites on it
[14:28:25] <Activ8> 1x test wordpress instance and it's nice n fast even external
[14:28:32] <lemming> so I get stupidly fast speeds, but also great reliability and the ability to snapshot it etc.
[14:28:43] <Activ8> and yuk to wordpress I know I know it's horrible but I have to work with it
[14:28:58] <lemming> hey, at least it's not Django :-P
[14:29:36] <Activ8> pfffff lol
[14:29:52] <Activ8> I'm running duplicati as a service for backups twice a day
[14:29:54] <Activ8> works great

[14:30:48] <Hunterkll> the ones that say '16' are server licenses for 16 cores (one instance)

[14:31:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:31:47] <Hunterkll> the dyanmics is like $170/mo per user

[14:34:03] <Activ8> Our UK laws are going to change soon I think in regards to the web
[14:34:15] <Hunterkll> i know a few people who run porn sites & whatnot off it
[14:34:17] <Hunterkll> no big deal
[14:34:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:34:40] <Activ8> it's going to be illegal to send a dick pic unsolicited 
[14:34:48] <Activ8> or whatever other way around
[14:34:48] <Activ8> e.t.c
[14:34:52] <Hunterkll> rip
[14:34:55] <Hunterkll> rip tinder
[14:35:05] <Activ8> we are going to need to auth over 18 for sites like porn
[14:35:15] <Activ8> the bill will push this through 100% this time
[14:35:24] <Activ8> they will just say deal with it
[14:35:24] <Kiernian> eh, I've long said the only people actually interested in unsolicited dick pics are a small subset of men who know how many minutes there are in a year.
[14:35:35] <Hunterkll> only way i could see that work is fi you could get idchecked at a porn store or gas station & pay cash 
[14:35:36] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:36:01] <Activ8> I dunno how they plan on making it work but there's a lot of laws coming into play soon they just checking over things with gov stuff
[14:36:26] <Activ8> https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-online-safety-laws-introduced-in-parliament
[14:36:36] <Activ8> it will come into play not sure when but it's coming
[14:36:46] <Activ8> there's a lot more as well but this is just the start
[14:37:01] <Hunterkll> future: 99% of UK and Russia traffic for some reason only connects to USA, Switzerland, and Japan 
[14:37:12] <Hunterkll> no one can figure out why
[14:37:19] <Hunterkll> porn site auth system sees 5 auths a day in UK
[14:37:27] <Hunterkll> politicians call it success, porn is gone from UK
[14:37:30] <Activ8> I have my sites blocked for all traffic except uk
[14:37:33] <Hunterkll> politicians go home and log into VPN 
[14:37:34] <Hunterkll> :D
[14:37:44] <Activ8> hacking attempts has decreased by 100%
[14:38:15] <Activ8> politicians are morons, they do what they like
[14:38:24] <Activ8> they make rules but never follow their own advice
[14:38:33] <Activ8> so people rebel and do what they like as well 
[14:39:05] <Activ8> I've personally had enough of them they just all lie through their teeth and can be seen straight through them the gaps so big

[15:41:40] <Hunterkll> fritzwastaken: once you start getting into the flow of things, 150 servers and 100 workstations are really no different management wise than 5000 servers and 40,000 workstations 
[15:41:54] <Hunterkll> the only thing that amplifies up is the number of layers of support staff 
[15:42:10] <Hunterkll> but from a backend view, it's the same level of effort for each position really
[15:42:15] <Hunterkll> just more people handling the same requests 
[15:42:18] <Kiernian> Hunterkll -- 40,000 employees just in your business unit?
[15:42:23] <Hunterkll> yep
[15:42:26] <Kiernian> fuuuuck
[15:42:32] <Hunterkll> and i run SCCM & SCOM for that unit
[15:42:41] <Hunterkll> and help consult on a few other things here and there
[15:42:57] <Kiernian> ooh. fun! I <3 SCCM. Haven't been in charge of it for about 7 years now, but good times.
[15:42:59] <Hunterkll> literally the same LOE as it was for me when i had 150 servers and 100 users 
[15:43:11] <Hunterkll> just instead of the 2nd sysadmin making packages and deploying them
[15:43:15] <Hunterkll> now there's a few people doing it 
[15:43:19] <Kiernian> yeah. sccm scales WELL.
[15:43:21] <Hunterkll> instead of the two of us making the OS SOE, there's a team for that 
[15:43:34] <Hunterkll> but i just do the same damn things i did in the small environment
[15:43:38] <Hunterkll> the numbers are ust bigger
[15:43:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:43:44] <Hunterkll> same with a lot of other tools
[15:44:01] <Hunterkll> same with accidentally rebooting all of production in the middle of vacation while your in a foreign country without your work laptop
[15:44:02] <Hunterkll> :D
[15:44:26] <kerat58> man, fudge that
[15:44:28] <riff-IRC> >doing work stuff on vacation
[15:44:30] <riff-IRC> NO.
[15:44:36] <Kiernian> eh, except for the higher liklihood of pissing off someone with clout. At those numbers there are a lot more people with clout :P
[15:44:38] <kerat58> more like running SSH from my Android while on the hotel's wifi in a foreign country
[15:44:43] <kerat58> that is more adventerous
[15:44:52] <kerat58> the second you open the laptop you have already lost half the battle
[15:44:55] <Hunterkll> riff-IRC: what part of "in a foreign country without your work laptop"
[15:44:59] <Hunterkll> did you not understand?
[15:45:08] <Hunterkll> it was because of a flag on a deployment i had done 14 days prior to the rebooting 
[15:45:21] <Hunterkll> it was my fault everything started rebooting in the middle of business hours
[15:45:27] <Hunterkll> but i didn't manually push a button while on vacation
[15:45:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:45:52] <riff-IRC> oh ok
[15:46:24] <Hunterkll> so yes, technically i rebooted all of prod, without any access to work resources (requires a shitload of approvals to take work hardware across borders - why i take my vacations out of country so i can't be pressed into work because i'm effectively 24/7 on call LOL)
[15:46:29] <Hunterkll> :D
[15:46:30] <Hunterkll> fun times
[15:46:42] <kerat58> that's a good strategy
[15:46:51] <Hunterkll> if you can afford it

[15:47:18] <Hunterkll> heh
[15:47:18] <sd> 08<G​ene> idk, travel isn't as expensive as people think if you plan it right
[15:47:26] <Activ8> Hunterkll that depends how many support requests are coming in at each level surely? having 20 tickets a week from 500 tickets a week from a support point of view is massive, I guess the more tickets get logged the more staff there should be if they are valid ticket requests
[15:47:43] <sd> 08<G​ene> like round trip tickets between chicago and paris are like $350-500...
[15:47:45] <kerat58> good point Gene.  And a lot of it is just avoiding traps.  Like "resorts."  And "airBNBs in the City Centre..."
[15:47:51] <Hunterkll> Activ8: again, if you keep the support staff:user count reasonable, it's just scaling numbers of people
[15:47:59] <Hunterkll> Activ8: 100 user site, 1 support tech
[15:48:03] <Hunterkll> i have no idea how many we actually have
[15:48:13] <sd> 08<G​ene> interestingly, i booked a hotel room downtown paris via airbnb
[15:48:16] <Hunterkll> but for a ticket to get to me, even at that site, ti'd be something requiring technical deep dive / issue with a backend system / etc

[15:56:31] <kerat58> TBH I shuttle to an s3-compatible API in a completely different vendor at this point
[15:56:31] <Hunterkll> but i think AWS's statement was like 2-3% data loss in that region of govcloud on EBS
[15:56:45] <kerat58> I don't particularly trust that everythign will "work out" 
[15:56:46] <Hunterkll> and by 2-3% we're not talking disk images, we're talking chunks of images, so lotta shit impacted

[15:56:55] <kerat58> ow
[15:56:56] <kerat58> wow

[15:57:04] <Hunterkll> well, in AWS, S3 and EBS are entirely separate stacks, physical and software wise 
[15:57:19] <kerat58> so all the cheapskates in the regular us regions got a better deal and didn't lose anything
[15:57:24] <kerat58> govcloud pays like 40% more

[17:26:28] <pcspkr> Hunterkll: how the fuck is syslog set up on opensuse
[17:26:40] <Hunterkll> i'd have to have an instance in front of me to tell you offhand
[17:26:53] <pcspkr> it looks like rsyslog doesn't read from the journal
[17:27:13] <Hunterkll> right now i'm balls deep in a squealing 6 year old properly set up environment that i need to extract data from without the right tools
[17:27:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[17:27:22] <Hunterkll> it... shouldn't?
[17:27:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> what are you trying to do ?
[17:28:07] <pcspkr> me?
[17:28:35] <Hunterkll> well, that'd help with the syslog question at any rate
[17:28:36] <Hunterkll> :P
[17:29:24] <pcspkr> I'm writing an rsyslog config from scratch because the default one in opensuse is ass
[17:29:37] <Hunterkll> *shrug* it's set up for the environment it's in, i suppose
[17:30:01] <Hunterkll> but none of my syslogs spit everything into journald 
[17:30:20] <pcspkr> rhel pushes all logs to journald and rsyslog reads from journal
[17:30:23] <pcspkr> afaik
[17:30:45] <pcspkr> on opensuse the rsyslog config doesn't contain the module for doing that
[17:30:51] <pcspkr> but /dev/log is -> journald
[17:31:27] <pcspkr> now I have to read how the fuck this is set up so I can decipher this
[17:31:43] <Hunterkll> i mean, journald's a bit simplistic in regards to like, policies/permissions/outputs/etc
[17:31:54] <Hunterkll> and we definitely don't want shit we put into syslog going into journald
[17:31:58] <Hunterkll> at least, some of it
[17:32:45] <pcspkr> honestly the logging in general on suse looks like ass compared to rhel
[17:33:02] <pcspkr> didn't notice it until now
[17:33:29] <Hunterkll> "honestly the X in general on $distro looks like ass compared to $distro" pretty much works for any component most of the time when someone uses a different distro
[17:33:29] <Hunterkll> XD
[17:33:40] <pcspkr> yes
[17:34:16] *** Joins: vinrock (~vinrock@user/vinrock)
[17:34:39] <Hunterkll> i mean honestly, do you want all the logs hitting syslog if say, you're doing log shipping, going into journald ?
[17:34:48] <Hunterkll> or say, what if you only want to send specific evenets/logs to a remote server
[17:34:53] <Hunterkll> journald i don't recall that even being possible
[17:34:53] <Hunterkll> etc
[17:35:40] <pcspkr> the default rhel config is sane imo
[17:36:00] <pcspkr> logs go -> journald -> rsyslog
[17:36:18] <Hunterkll> some stuff still goes straight to syslog 
[17:36:25] <Hunterkll> depending on application/service/whatever
[17:36:33] <Hunterkll> and journald is so damn inflexible
[17:36:35] <pcspkr> the ones writing their own logs directly, yes
[17:36:56] <pcspkr> but now I wanna know how the fuck suse does this
[17:37:16] <PattyCakes> I hate.
[17:37:18] <PattyCakes> That is all.
[17:37:26] <Hunterkll> i mean, journald in suse is unfortunately the default log destination for everything out of box, i didn't even think it'd have rsyslog installed by default 
[17:37:33] <Hunterkll> also, i thought syslog-ng used to be the default
[17:37:35] <Hunterkll> *shrug*
[17:37:49] <pcspkr> but it appears not to be
[17:37:57] <Hunterkll> did you manually install it, or was it caught as a dependancy of something?
[17:38:11] <fritzwastaken> Morning PattyCakes 
[17:38:20] <PattyCakes> o\
[17:38:22] <PattyCakes> \o
[17:38:23] <pcspkr> rsyslog.conf needs module(load="imjournal") for reading from journal to syslog
[17:38:32] <Hunterkll> right, why would you want that?
[17:38:45] <fritzwastaken> How are PattyCakes things going?
[17:38:53] <pcspkr> why not?
[17:38:59] <pcspkr> that's the default in rhel and works well

[17:59:52] <PublicWiFi> I don't think netsec is my calling lol
[17:59:55] <PublicWiFi> its so... fuckin... dry
[17:59:58] <PublicWiFi> xDDD
[17:59:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> PublicWiFi so I would kinda pick, do you want to work in M365 or Azure, and then start there.  MS900 / AZ900 will give you a good BASIC starting point for both
[18:00:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> then go from th ere
[18:00:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> i mostly work in the M365 space 
[18:00:10] <thegodsquirrel> Lolz Bell La-Padula isn't boring!!
[18:00:13] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> omfg az900 is nap time
[18:00:17] <PublicWiFi> I'd rather work in azure space I think
[18:00:18] <AnonymooseReddtr> so I've got a bunch of certs.  Ms700, Ms720
[18:00:19] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: found it
[18:00:22] <sintax> az900 is more about selling features and what it is to businesses. 
[18:00:27] <sintax> its so boring
[18:00:31] <PublicWiFi> no u
[18:00:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> sintax yeah its boring as f. but it lays a good foundation for what is there
[18:00:36] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: they're using imuxsock.so instead - rsyslog manual says imjournal is far more performance/IO intensive
[18:00:42] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> I need to get my foot into my server and start putting some devops stuff together
[18:00:42] <sintax> yeah
[18:00:42] <Hunterkll> that's my working theory anyway
[18:00:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> then you can dig into the deeper level ones like Az104, Az105 etc.
[18:00:45] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> I've been lazy on it
[18:00:47] <PublicWiFi> i have to say, ignoring sd was the best decision i've made in a while
[18:00:54] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: you'd want to kill imuxsock if you want to use imjournal 
[18:00:57] <sintax> i'm just gonna get my sec+ next month and go from there. either net+ for pentesting.
[18:01:00] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> am I included here PublicWifi?

[18:01:08] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> ...PublicWifi?
[18:01:13] <PublicWiFi> i'd do net+ first if you're getting both anyway
[18:01:22] <PublicWiFi> cause half of sec+ is net+
[18:01:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> on the MS side, MS500 is great for security 
[18:01:25] <sintax> true

[18:01:42] *** Joins: arlion (~arlion@user/arlion)
[18:01:53] <thegodsquirrel> Net+ then do Sec+ to renew Net+ 
[18:01:53] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: after reading the rsyslog manual, it makes even more sense - https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imjournal.html
[18:01:54] <sintax> oof
[18:01:56] <PublicWiFi> i took those a few years back
[18:01:56] <sintax> $165
[18:02:02] <PublicWiFi> i bet they've expired now lol
[18:02:04] <DrGibby> MACCAS, CISSP is dry but it opens pracyevwry security door
[18:02:05] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I've you've worked in Azure for a couple months you can pass without studying
[18:02:05] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: so it is capturing the same data, but in a less performance intensive way 
[18:02:11] <PublicWiFi> DrGibby: its so bad man
[18:02:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> ben i wouldn't say that
[18:02:14] <DrGibby> Think of it as doing time in hell desk 
[18:02:14] <PublicWiFi> so bad xDD
[18:02:16] <thegodsquirrel> Then do Server+ to renew the other two
[18:02:17] <DrGibby> I know it is!
[18:02:28] <PublicWiFi> i've been reading more about netsec life honestly
[18:02:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> You could work in Azure just doing IaaS work and be clueless when it comes to Pass
[18:02:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> err PaaS
[18:02:44] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: even rsyslog in the latest stable release manual advises against using imjournal, lol
[18:02:44] <PublicWiFi> I've kinda learned that I'm not really a documentation guy. I mean I do it at work ofc but
[18:02:51] <PublicWiFi> write-ups aren't my thing
[18:02:53] <DrGibby> CISSP is a bore, but it sets the foundation to literally everything 
[18:03:03] <pcspkr> Hunterkll: well rhel uses it lol

[18:03:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> i've not tried Az104

[18:46:04] <McDonaldsWiFi> best group
[18:46:07] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: Note that it is now the journal that listens on /dev/log, no longer the BSD syslog daemon directly. If your logging daemon wants to get access to all logging data then it should listen on /run/systemd/journal/syslog instead via the syslog.socket unit file that is shipped along with systemd. On a systemd system it is no longer OK to listen on /dev/log directly, and your daemon may not bind to the 
[18:46:07] <Hunterkll> /run/systemd/journal/syslog socket on its own. If you do that then you will lose logging from STDOUT/STDERR of services (as well as other stuff).

[18:52:49] <Bru^> but i do need 2-3
[18:52:50] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: tl;dr, if you follow the upstream documentation, this makes a whole lot more sense

[18:53:22] <bomb> I mean, low
[18:53:22] <bomb> lol
[18:53:27] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: on the imuxsock documentation page, look at the 'coexistence with systemd' page
[18:53:30] <bomb> hahhah
[18:53:39] <pcspkr> Hunterkll: yea I just linked it
[18:53:49] <McDonaldsWiFi> dang!
[18:53:53] <Hunterkll> yep
[18:53:55] <ender> they coss less than what I paid for a single Dell 3008WFp in 2009
[18:54:08] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: so yea, still, makes a lot of sense here in the end
[18:54:12] <pcspkr> Hunterkll: must be imuxsock reads from the right path by default since the path is not configured
[18:54:25] <SirSceptalot> with 27", I quite like 1440p. 1080 isn't enough, 4k is a bit overkill IMO
[18:54:27] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: right, the module is built systemd aware and expects that path, apparently 
[18:54:34] <Hunterkll> Rsyslog should by default be configured for systemd support on all platforms that usually run systemd (which means most Linux distributions, but not, for example, Solaris).
[18:54:48] <McDonaldsWiFi> yeah i've been looking at 1440 114hz
[18:54:49] <Hunterkll> so the module already knows/expects that if that socket exists, feed from it 
[18:54:58] <ender> 5k is great on 27″ – it's exactly twice the resolution of 1440p
[18:55:19] <McDonaldsWiFi> at that resolution do you even need to turn on AA on games?
[18:55:43] <ender> not really (not that I game much)
[18:55:59] <Joe-Developer> I have 4x 1080p monitors at home
[18:56:06] <Joe-Developer> 3x 60hz 1x 144hz
[18:56:15] <Joe-Developer> hz > resolution any day for me
[18:56:21] <Joe-Developer> find its so much easier on my eyes
[18:56:36] <McDonaldsWiFi> yeah for sure
[18:56:43] <McDonaldsWiFi> i'd rather have 1440p at 144hz than 4k at 60
[18:56:44] <ender> I'm running them off GTX1070 and a DP1.4 hub (both displays use two DP cables, but they're DP1.2, so I have one of them plugged into a hub)
[18:57:00] <McDonaldsWiFi> you can daisy chain DP on some setups right?
[18:57:14] <ender> yes, that's basically a monitor with built-in hub
[18:57:24] <McDonaldsWiFi> we need thunderbolt chains already
[18:57:30] <McDonaldsWiFi> power, data, everything in 1 cable
[18:57:40] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: in the end, kind of interesting redhat chose to do it the way they did, then. Wonder what their logic was
[18:57:42] <SirSceptalot> it's surprisingly hard to find though. So few sites mention if a monitor has an output
[18:58:07] <SirSceptalot> I mean, you can find them, but it's not always obvious which support it and which don't
[18:58:17] <pcspkr> Hunterkll: yes
[18:58:56] <Hunterkll> I'd lean more twards SuSE's config, but that's because it's in line with package upstream's directives
[18:58:56] <Joe-Developer> McDonaldsWiFi: isn't that usbc
[18:59:04] <McDonaldsWiFi> yes and no i think?
[18:59:05] <Hunterkll> SuSE is rather good about doing stuff like that
[18:59:19] <McDonaldsWiFi> USB formfactor but a differnt protocol on top but I might be talking out of my ass
[18:59:23] <ender> Joe-Developer: USB-C with DP-Alt is slightly different from TB3
[18:59:27] <McDonaldsWiFi> pretty sure thunderbolt is USB-c compliant
[18:59:35] <McDonaldsWiFi> compatible*
[18:59:38] <McDonaldsWiFi> but can also do more
[18:59:49] <Joe-Developer> ah I wasn't really on about the specifics for DP

[18:59:51] <layer8> McDonaldsWiFi meant: "pretty sure my butt is USB-c compliant"

[19:00:04] <McDonaldsWiFi> I'm a usb micro kind of guy
[19:00:04] <ender> USB-C sucks – just with cables there are at least 8 different types available (last time I looked), and good luck guessing what the cable supports
[19:00:08] <fritzwastaken> lol

[19:20:55] <signofzeta> @Killnine Officially, it's required.  Unofficially, it's optional if it's only for management, if you're good with ADSI and/or PowerShell.

[19:23:27] <signofzeta> We have many clients with AADC running without an Exchange server.
[19:23:50] <Hunterkll> @Killnine yes
[19:23:52] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yes, everyone says that but they'd be unable to get help from MS if they need it

[19:24:18] <ender> (I did figure out how to add it back later)
[19:24:30] <Hunterkll> Customers with a hybrid configuration often find after a period of time that all of their mailboxes have been moved to Exchange Online. At this point, they may decide to remove the Exchange servers from on-premises. However, they discover that they can no longer manage their cloud mailboxes.

[20:38:11] <McDonaldsWiFi> why sonicwall
[20:38:17] <sintax> because fuck you
[20:38:25] <McDonaldsWiFi> seriously thats teh answer, I can't believe it
[20:38:37] <sintax> there has to be a better way i'd think

[20:39:55] <DrGibby> "its under review"
[20:40:00] <McDonaldsWiFi> right
[20:40:03] <sintax> heh
[20:40:05] <McDonaldsWiFi> but ill still need 50 address objects
[20:40:07] <McDonaldsWiFi> which is fucking INSANE
[20:40:09] <mistiry> oh, yeah i agree
[20:40:09] <McDonaldsWiFi> lol
[20:40:20] <sintax> security is fun!
[20:40:23] <mistiry> just making sure you knew you could group the objects so you arent ALSO making 50 deny rules
[20:40:25] <McDonaldsWiFi> DomLS3: come try to defend that
[20:40:34] <McDonaldsWiFi> it would be quite the site to see though

[21:01:15] <vinrock> im gona do some more homework i think thisll work
[21:01:43] <vinrock> i dont know shit about phones i just know i need it to be able to output 600ohm or itll distort
[21:02:20] <mistiry> i also dont know that you're gonna get the right signal out of the phone to feed a loudspeaker
[21:02:37] <vinrock> yeah thats what in trying to figure out
[21:02:42] <vinrock> i see big converter boxes and small simple ones
[21:02:51] <Hunterkll> so 
[21:02:53] <Hunterkll> i figure
[21:03:20] <Hunterkll> you need the pinoiut
[21:03:41] <bomb> took you 27 seconds to type :)

[21:03:58] <bomb> fair. one-hand typing is slow
[21:03:59] <mistiry> ?
[21:03:59] <Hunterkll> get pinout, you'll be getting 4 ohm output probably for the audio 
[21:04:10] <Hunterkll> or maybe 8, look at what's in the headset/handset
[21:04:15] <Hunterkll> then somehow convert that to 600ohm
[21:04:19] <Hunterkll> make your own damn cable
[21:04:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:04:51] <Hunterkll> since it's an ip phone, anyway, you'll most likely be working with simple DC audio
[21:04:58] <Hunterkll> or is it an ip phone providing regular phone hookups?
[21:05:00] <mistiry> also is the phone outputting an analog waveform to the headset or is it digital? i also dont really do phones.

[21:51:16] <mistiry> nice
[21:51:18] <DrGibby> nice
[21:51:22] <Hunterkll> was nice though, because we could reliably use machine level permissions predictably 
[21:51:24] <Hunterkll> now we can't 
[21:51:43] <Hunterkll> but taht was just a convinence really
[21:52:06] <mistiry> you can still look up what laptop goes to what user
[21:52:23] <mistiry> youre just not naming the PC after that user
[21:52:44] <Hunterkll> sure, but now we give them service accounts for dev stuff instead of just machine account, heh 
[21:52:47] <mistiry> and if its in an inventory system, you can probably do so programmatically
[21:52:59] <mistiry> well yeah i was just addressing your thing about machine level permissions
[21:53:00] <Hunterkll> for use on-machine 
[21:53:04] <Hunterkll> yea
[21:53:22] <Hunterkll> so instead of just running dev stuff and granting that machine account perms to access network stuff and relying on the disabled object to handle uncleaned up permissions 
[21:53:32] <Hunterkll> we give AD based service accounts now scoped to the machine 
[21:53:52] <Hunterkll> like i said, itw as a convinence thing 
[21:54:49] <Hunterkll> our server naming schema was standardized though... in like a 30 page document 
[21:54:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:54:57] <Hunterkll> i should see if i can find that sometime

[21:55:23] <Hunterkll> we used 3 letter codes for the purpose of the machine in the name, so APP = application server.

[22:35:50] <sintax> they're plugging directly in to the printer thinking it will work and it doesn't 
[22:35:59] <sintax> so it says it's offline on their pc when they do that.

[22:46:45] <Hunterkll> ofc, a lot of stuff isn't released either

[22:47:14] <Hunterkll> to avoid bringing attention to it
[22:47:23] <Hunterkll> (for all vendors)

[23:38:54] <sd> 08<G​ene> first day i started here, i installed gogs and documented my day to day in git - i think it has a wiki markdown too

[23:39:22] <sd> 08<G​ene> i liked confluence more than sharepoint, but that's my take

[23:40:04] <sintax> i'm not used to the terminal in mac being unix. yay more commands to learn. 
[23:40:07] <Hunterkll> @NinjaStyle I mean, it's far better than xterm, but it's not exactly a priority product 
[23:40:19] <Hunterkll> sintax: well, macOS is a unix distribution... what'd you expect?
[23:40:42] <sintax> i haven't owned a mac since college so never thought about it. 
[23:41:09] <Hunterkll> well, even back then it was too

[23:45:00] <sd> 08<G​ene> god, what was it?
[23:45:06] <nx032> yeah but do you need a user cal when the entire thing is licensed as a device cal?
[23:45:10] <Hunterkll> i've got CVS, SVN, and GIT in play at home, because of different repository age 
[23:45:18] <Hunterkll> nx032: not if you have a license for every device that's accessing the RDS instance
[23:45:24] <sd> 08<G​ene> what do you use for your git server at home hunterkll?
[23:45:30] <Hunterkll> @Gene TFS
[23:45:35] <sd> 08<G​ene> oh
[23:45:43] <EmetSelch> ayyy TFS lol
[23:45:47] <nx032> if im paying for relay1 to have 15 simultaneous users, and remote1 to have 2 simultaneous devices
[23:45:49] <Hunterkll> Haven't updated to ADO yet
[23:46:01] <mistiry> ADO <3
[23:46:04] <EmetSelch> I am on ADO 2020, it does its job
[23:46:06] <mistiry> sadly, we are having to use bitbucket
[23:46:06] <Hunterkll> nx032: then get rid of relay1 :P
[23:46:12] <EmetSelch> and I have VMware Harbor as container registry 
[23:46:36] <nx032> Hunterkll, no :) because then I need 13 more device CALs
[23:46:36] <Hunterkll> nx032: so in that scenario, if you have 15 users accessing remote1, then you  just need 15 user cals, no device cals
[23:46:37] <Hunterkll> that's it
[23:46:40] <sd> 08<G​ene> gogs is pretty hard to beat for simple deployment
[23:46:44] <Hunterkll> nx032: device OR user cal
[23:46:49] <sd> 08<G​ene> literally single click executable and local http, aww yiss
[23:46:59] <sd> 08<G​ene> my git server doesn't even listen outside 127.0.0.1
[23:47:00] <Hunterkll> nx032: in a user CAL scenario, you only license the user, no devices or intermediates
[23:48:03] <sd> 08<G​ene> oh god, i have a fun story about bitbucket
[23:48:23] <sd> 08<G​ene> once upon a time, a veteran tech had setup a place with puppet and stored in bitbucket; they moved on to another place
[23:48:37] <sd> 08<G​ene> the replacement decided to update a configuration in bitbucket, of course they used wordpad and broke everything horribly
[23:48:38] <nx032> the issue was that the server was already licensed with like 10 device CALs. The users don't usually need to be in it, but theres a pool of 20 people that need to occasionally access. Shouldve been licensed as User but wasnt when they set it up. So the only workaround was to relay through relay1, which was an already existing server for other purposes, but then you could just remote to remote1 and not have to deal with the 
[23:48:38] <nx032> "you have run out of licenses and cant sign in"
[23:48:42] <sd> 08<G​ene> the end, not really a story about bitbucket
[23:48:43] <sd> 08<G​ene> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:48:55] *** Joins: llh (~UPP@user/llh)
[23:49:13] <sd> 08<G​ene> CALs reset after 90 days iirc(?) ?
[23:49:25] <Hunterkll> you can move CALs to different devices or users every 90 days
[23:49:26] <Hunterkll> by license terms
[23:49:34] <nx032> its ocassional but not that far apart ocassional
[23:49:43] <nx032> its like a twice a month thing for ten minutes
[23:49:47] <Hunterkll> nx032: well, how many devices actually access the instance 
[23:49:52] <nx032> 20
[23:50:00] <nx032> ish
[23:50:03] <Hunterkll> i'd throw 10  more device CALs at it and toss the relay boxes 
[23:50:03] <nx032> probably less
[23:50:05] <Hunterkll> in that scenario
[23:50:09] <Hunterkll> would be cheaper than the user cals 
[23:50:11] <Hunterkll> but meh
[23:50:17] <nx032> relay boxes are important and used for other things
[23:50:21] <Hunterkll> ah sure
[23:50:26] <sd> 08<G​ene> previous gig was .edu, they get practically free CALs honestly
[23:50:28] <Hunterkll> but either way, you're 10 device cals out of compliance
[23:50:29] <Hunterkll> :)
[23:50:36] <Hunterkll> actually, given the relay boxes, 12
[23:50:44] <sd> 08<G​ene> Microsoft really loves academic licensing >.<
[23:51:30] <Hunterkll> long story short: in a 1 user to 1 device scenario, just use user cals :D
[23:51:50] <nx032> microsofts licensing is very capitalistic
[23:52:04] <sd> 08<G​ene> if you want commie licensing, go open source
[23:52:10] <Hunterkll> *shrug*
[23:52:17] <nx032> " Even though the BDM is reviewing a report posted to another server, he or she needs a CAL due to the directly realized benefit of the server’s automatic posting"
[23:52:22] <Hunterkll> it's quite simple, any user accessing a system needs to be licensed.... somehow 
[23:52:30] <nx032> "you benefited now pay"
[23:52:49] <Hunterkll> that'd just be a server cal, i'd assume
[23:52:55] <Hunterkll> not sure where you got that from
[23:53:06] <nx032> id rather pay $3000 per windows server license than deal with this turd abstraction model of needing a license for every fart you make 
[23:53:13] <sd> 08<G​ene> there's a good chance the user already has a user cal from just being part of the domain D:
[23:53:21] <sd> 08<G​ene> erm, you need both.
[23:53:34] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> ^
[23:53:48] <Hunterkll> nx032: that'd create a higher barrier to entry for smaller shops, which was the whole point of this separate licensing scheme
[23:53:52] <sd> 08<G​ene> you need a license for your server; then a license for cals, they did away with small business server iirc
[23:54:00] <sd> 08<G​ene> and business essentials where they included the CALs in the server software
[23:54:05] <Hunterkll> @Gene Foundation's still a thing
[23:54:09] <sd> 08<G​ene> oh, TIL
[23:54:18] <sd> 08<G​ene> what's the user cap? 20?
[23:54:21] <nx032> Hunterkll, smaller shops dont use this, they use windows home and quickbooks
[23:54:27] <Hunterkll> nx032: not always, lol
[23:54:38] <Hunterkll> smaller being 50 people company with 5 who use the server type deal
[23:54:39] <Hunterkll> but anyway
[23:54:55] <nx032> i really dont know why the hell we're using so many windows servers
[23:54:58] <McDonaldsWiFi> the owner's husband (boomers) bought a new truck for the company for client trips and its pretty smol
[23:55:04] <nx032> we have like fifteen of them
[23:55:04] <sd> 08<G​ene> 25 users, huh.
[23:55:04] <sd> 08<G​ene> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407265509931745281/956272388553715742/unknown.png

[23:55:08] <McDonaldsWiFi> he told them to lose weight
[23:55:11] <McDonaldsWiFi> fucking dead dude
[23:55:15] <nx032> atleast five of them can be linux file servers
[23:55:20] <sd> 08<G​ene> why?
[23:55:28] <sd> 08<G​ene> you could get away with 2 fileservers probably with dfs
[23:55:42] <Hunterkll> that, and in a windows client environment, you really would rather have windows fileservers anyway
[23:55:50] <nx032> theyre in different regions
[23:55:50] <Hunterkll> if just from a performance perspective
[23:55:55] <nx032> shit aint interconnected
[23:56:01] <sd> 08<G​ene> oh
[23:56:07] <nx032> once it is its all going on one server, and getting replicated realtime
[23:56:37] <Hunterkll> but still, regardless, users are already CAL covered, so why wouldn't you use the right tool for the job
[23:56:47] <EmetSelch> ^
[23:56:49] <nx032> If we have 200 users, technically wouldnt I need 200 user CALS?
[23:56:50] <sd> 08<G​ene> save on server licensing?
[23:57:07] <sd> 08<G​ene> yes
[23:57:08] <Hunterkll> nx032: if they're logging into AD joined workstations, you already need the user CALs 
[23:57:12] <nx032> I aint wasting 200 user CALS worth of cash to run file shares
[23:57:35] <sd> 08<G​ene> each user that gets a CAL can use that CAL for *any* microsoft service... you don't need 1 user cal per service they touch
[23:57:48] <sd> 08<G​ene> the exclusion being remote desktop client access licenses
[23:58:09] <sd> 08<G​ene> there's probably other license exceptions too honestly like o365 and whatnot, but those are different services tbf
[23:58:32] <sd> 08<G​ene> oh yeah, exchange cals exist too
[23:58:45] <sd> 08<G​ene> i suppose any windows server service needs a user cal*
[23:59:23] <nx032> you know for as much as they love charging you think theyd have made an app that lets you draw up your network and they automatically let you know how many licensing of everything you need
[23:59:26] <Hunterkll> Exchange, Sharepoint, SQL, TFS/ADO (but a VS sub counts as a CAL for that) 
[23:59:38] <Hunterkll> nx032: that's the thing though, you could have 200 users, but only 5 actually need an SQL CAL
[23:59:49] <Hunterkll> so it's not something you can really automate
