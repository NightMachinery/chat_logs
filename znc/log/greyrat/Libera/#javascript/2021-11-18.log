[01:42:10] <rapha> the whole point of it is that the user should be able to override the value. i guess after such an override, a grace period of a second or so would be in order before it can change again by itself.

[02:59:43] <ljharb> pulse: that is not my experience
[02:59:45] <FlorianBad> pulse: shift doesn't work on HTMLCollections : https://jsfiddle.net/Lw4ev6m1/1/
[02:59:51] <ljharb> pulse: what is "large" to you
[03:00:22] <pulse> FlorianBad, Ok, you definitely shouldn't have a very large HTMLCollection :D
[03:00:28] <pulse> You can design stuff in a better way
[03:00:38] <pulse> ljharb, IDK, it's arbitrary. More than 10k items I would consider large I guess
[03:00:50] <pulse> But there's definitely situations where you have that much data, or more

[03:03:06] <FlorianBad> ok, yeah then it shouldn't be that "large" I guess :)
[03:04:01] <FlorianBad> well but hold on, even slice doesn't work on some HTMLCollection : https://jsfiddle.net/Lw4ev6m1/2/
[03:04:22] <pulse> No, it's not an Array type
[03:04:36] <FlorianBad> I know but what do you do if you want to do that then?
[03:05:04] <pulse> let arrayElements = [...htmlCollection]
[03:05:21] <pulse> That converts it into an array
[03:05:50] <FlorianBad> pulse: is it "clean" ... ? or is it more on the ugly side? :)
[03:06:14] <pulse> Looks pretty clean to me ;)
[03:06:18] <FlorianBad> ok :)

[03:10:08] <FlorianBad> hmmm, am I forgetting something? https://jsfiddle.net/Lw4ev6m1/3/
[03:14:10] <pulse> Try console.log(elements[i].getAttribute('id'));
[03:14:25] <andyandyandy> collections can be spread?
[03:15:06] <andyandyandy> ah .shift returns the element removed from the array. it doesnt return the array
[03:15:21] <andyandyandy> so `elements` has no .length, since it's a div
[03:15:41] <FlorianBad> ah... well, I forgot slice is not like splice but the opposite :)
[03:16:24] <FlorianBad> so like this:  https://jsfiddle.net/Lw4ev6m1/4/   (but shift() still doesn't work as I thought it would)
[03:16:47] <FlorianBad> andyandyandy: ah! indeed :)

[14:44:43] <Maxdamantus> cthulchu: the `Function` constructor takes code as a string. It's basically the less evil way of evaluating code than eval.
[14:45:22] <Maxdamantus> Evaluating code is usually not what people should be doing though. It was certainly a lot more common to do that 15 years ago.
[14:45:38] <Maxdamantus> !eval
[14:45:39] <jellobot> Maxdamantus, The `eval` function has two use cases: macro expansion, and evaluating dynamically generated programs. `eval` is probably not the answer for your problem. See https://blog.racket-lang.org/2011/10/on-eval-in-dynamic-languages-generally-and-in-racket-specifically.html for details. See unsafe-eval in !csp for security aspects.

[14:49:10] <cthulchu> also, why would you declare a function like this: var getResponsiveLayout=function()...
[14:49:35] <cthulchu> it looks awkward to me, why not just function getResponsiveLayout()...
[14:50:06] <cthulchu> damn why would you want to make it a var
[14:50:13] <Maxdamantus> Probably just because it worked. The overall perception of what good code is gets refined over time.
[14:51:33] <Maxdamantus> and it didn't go against any tool-based assumptions that exist nowadays, eg, being able to run the code through a minfier.
[14:52:46] <Maxdamantus> You should instead ask why people don't write code like that nowadays, and compare how relevant those reasons would have been 15 years ago.

[16:22:53] <The_Blode> Good afternoon all.
[16:23:09] <The_Blode> Is there any way to conceal your JavaScript code from the DOM?
[16:24:21] <Alexendoo> The_Blode: What do you mean by that exactly?
[16:24:50] <The_Blode> Say I have some JavaScript on my page and I don't want to expose it to say, View Source users.
[16:25:09] <The_Blode> My hunch is it cannot be hidden...but wanted to confirm with more knowledgeable guys like yourselves.
[16:25:24] <Alexendoo> It cannot be hidden
[16:27:04] <stenno> very hard code smell if you want to do that
[16:27:24] <The_Blode> Oh
[16:27:43] <The_Blode> Does it smell if you want to hide it?

[16:28:50] <The_Blode> Understood. If I think carefully about it...JavaScript is clientside (in the case of Vanilla) meaning...it executes inside the browser. Therefore all the JavaScript code must be present there to function.
[16:28:59] <The_Blode> Therefore, nothing can be hidden at all from the engine.
[16:29:07] <stenno> that is exactly correct
[16:29:25] <The_Blode> And if I try to hide the code, it's smelly
[16:29:32] <undefined_bob> what is with those Obfuscator tools? Maybe they can help a little?
[16:29:40] <The_Blode> So copyrighted JavaScript code is not a thing?
[16:29:57] <Alexendoo> copyright doesn't require you to attempt to hide things
[16:30:48] <The_Blode> I mean, to prevent the source code from being copied.
[16:31:03] <The_Blode> Say the JS is proprietory.
[16:31:15] <The_Blode> Can JavaScript code be classed as that?
[16:31:47] <The_Blode> I'm familiar with other languages having this kind of licensing...but with JavaScript, I can't think of anything like that.

[19:11:16] <freeman_h> Hi guys, how do i remove a class from a list
[19:11:37] <freeman_h> document.getElementsByClassName('aligncenter').remove('register');
[19:11:43] <freeman_h> doesnt work
[19:13:13] <davis> fwiw, in my code, i'mm doing this which works
[19:13:22] <Svitkona> are you trying to remove the aligncenter class from the register element?
[19:13:22] <stenno> document.querySelectorAll('.aligncenter').forEach(el => el.classList.remove('register'))
[19:13:57] <davis> pbf = new pb.Decoder('some args'); ret = pbf.decode(some constant buffer);
[19:14:01] <davis> that works
[19:14:16] <stenno> davis: i will look at it, sec
[19:14:20] <davis> then I try to display the result like so response.write(ret); which fails
[19:14:47] <davis> I believe its because the decoder needs to process the result and perhaps its in progress?

[19:33:59] <stenno> is it just as a beginner project?
[19:34:07] <davis> i have ot decode a GOES satellite buffer which is in pseudo binary. rather thaan write a translator I found this javascript library.
[19:34:35] <davis> it would be wonderful if I knew how to make a dialog box, so I could just enter text and then hit the decode button.

[19:34:53] <davis> as it is now, I will edit the code each time I am trying to find the decode.
[19:35:33] <davis> this is but a small problem/bump in a much larger problem. namely getting these buffers decoded for know satellite payloads so we can mimic for our own uploads.
[19:35:36] <stenno> oh you want to write a frontend too:
[19:36:01] <stenno> yeah at some point you have to either spend time to learn it a bit or spend money to find someone to write code for you
[19:36:19] <davis> it wwould be grand to have a text box and then pass the contents to this working bit

[20:12:29] <Elliria> Hey there, I'm using inline JavaScript on my home page in Firefox to open multiple tabs from one link, but Firefox is blocking pop-ups. I'd like to add my home page to Firefox's exceptions list, but haven't figured out the syntax to get it to register the page correctly. Nobody is answering in the Firefox channel. Is there any chance I could get help here, or is this not a good place for that?

[21:12:03] <sheetjs> it may not be representable in utf8/utf16
[21:12:23] <sheetjs> darkdrgn2k: strange that they dont have a binary string option
[21:12:55] <darkdrgn2k> im actually verry confused as in other part of the doc they say it is a binary string :/
[21:13:02] *** Joins: cthulchu (~Cthulchu@193.194.107.250)
[21:13:08] <sheetjs> just ask to get back the Uint8array
[21:13:29] <sheetjs> and use TextDecoder to post process
[21:13:52] <sheetjs> !mdn textdecoder
[21:13:53] <jellobot> sheetjs, TextDecoder interface represents a decoder for a specific text encoding, such as UTF-8, ISO-8859-2, KOI8-R, GBK, etc. A decoder takes a stream of bytes as input and emits a stream of code points. https://mdn.io/textdecoder
[21:14:04] <darkdrgn2k> "inflate(data[, options])
[21:14:05] <darkdrgn2k>   -> Uint8Array| String"
[21:14:25] <darkdrgn2k> but it says to (String) - if equal to 'string', then result will be converted from utf8 to utf16 (javascript) string.
[21:14:26] <sheetjs> right, the tricky part with strings is the underlying encoding
[21:14:35] <darkdrgn2k> right and i think thast whats cayusing issues
[21:14:44] <sheetjs> I think what it's trying to say is
[21:14:51] <sheetjs> interpret the byte sequence as UTF8
[21:14:53] <darkdrgn2k> so instead im trying not to use string and do  var dataBlob = new Blob(data, { "type": "image/jpg" });
[21:15:04] <sheetjs> the "utf16" part is just saying to convert to JS characters
[21:15:18] <darkdrgn2k> ah so it is utf8 then
[21:15:36] <darkdrgn2k> so question is, how do i get it to base64 encoding so i can display the jpg in an img :/
[21:15:40] <sheetjs> the byte sequence is interpreted as a sequence of utf8 characters
[21:15:42] <davis> ahh, i got it working via cli,
[21:15:44] <davis> https://github.com/rtp-gcp/node_testy/blob/main/testy_cli/decoder_argv.js
[21:15:51] <sheetjs> you don't want that
[21:16:23] <darkdrgn2k> so i want the string
[21:16:36] <sheetjs> you want the byte sequence and convert it to base64 manually
[21:16:54] <darkdrgn2k> byte sequence meaning an array?
[21:17:00] <sheetjs> Uint8Array yeah
[21:17:12] <darkdrgn2k> ok so now how do i get it into base64..
[21:17:55] <darkdrgn2k> or rather i need to get it into a src.img
[21:18:07] <darkdrgn2k> uhh img.src :P
[21:18:19] <sheetjs> what's the actual end goal
[21:18:40] <sheetjs> if you need a URL so you can plug into an img tag
[21:18:54] <sheetjs> you should go uint8array -> blob -> URL
[21:19:04] <darkdrgn2k> so
[21:19:04] <darkdrgn2k>  var dataBlob = new Blob(data, { "type": "image/jpg" });
[21:19:15] <sheetjs> [data]
[21:19:24] <sheetjs> Blob constructor takes an array of parts
[21:19:34] <darkdrgn2k> ah ok..
[21:19:47] <darkdrgn2k> then from blob to url ?
[21:20:00] <darkdrgn2k> (asking cuase last time i tried  it it froze firefox :P)
[21:20:36] <sheetjs> blob -> URL is `URL.createObjectUrl(dataBlob)`
[21:21:07] <sheetjs> !mdn URL.createObjectURL
[21:21:08] <jellobot> sheetjs, URL.createObjectURL() static method creates a DOMString containing a URL representing the object given in the parameter. https://mdn.io/URL.createObjectURL

[22:44:41] <qswz> how to count a number of times a string appears in aother string, without regexp?
[22:45:28] <qswz> thinking of .split
[22:45:38] <qswz> .indexOf would be boring
[22:45:51] <lantech19446> no the program I'm using is scraping a web page for me so I want to combine results like right now it might list \coalition\ 3 times with different hits and visitors I would want it to combine \coalition\ and then add the hits and the visitors together
[22:46:24] <lantech19446> I think I know how to do the last part but i'm not sure about how to compare the strings and I also need to know if it would work in nodejs

[22:48:13] <stenno> string1 === string2
[22:48:26] <stenno> tests if a string is equal to another string
[22:48:53] <qswz> do you guys also sometimes write ==== !===?
[22:48:57] <lantech19446> ok and then I can use an if else loop for the rest
[22:48:59] <qswz> happens to me way too often
[22:50:06] <lantech19446> ok time to go pull some books, thanks for the help. I think I can figure it out from there

[23:06:51] <cthulchu> my most wonderful folks! I'm trying to debug typescript. This line: let gat = window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; works fine in JS, but TS says: Property 'dataLayer' does not exist on type 'Window & typeof globalThis
