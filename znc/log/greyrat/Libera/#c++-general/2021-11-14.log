[03:10:59] <created> Hey, I notice that when enabling MSVC's /std:c++latest mode, it adds various standard-conforming diagnostics
[03:11:02] <created> One of them, though, seems to be "not/and/xor etc. are keywords equivalent to !/&&/^/etc."
[03:11:04] <created> In gcc/clang, you can override this rule via -fno-operator-names
[03:11:07] <created> But is it possible to override this rule in MSVC with /std:c++latest? (ideally without removing the other diagnostics)
[03:11:55] <TinoDidriksen> Why do you want to override that? They are keywords. If your code uses them as not keywords, the code is broken.
[03:12:12] <AmR> very_sneaky: Thanks :)
[03:13:46] <created> For the same reason you'd enable -fno-operator-names

[06:12:21] <ItsLandon> RandomReader: perhaps I'm just confused. I have tmp/foo as a target that generates temp/foo and then all depends on tmp/foo. Is that not what you're talking about?
[06:12:56] <RandomReader> at a basic level, a target in a Makefile is a file that should exist
[06:13:07] <RandomReader> if it doesn't or is out of date, then make follows the remainder of the rule to rebuild it
[06:13:35] <RandomReader> special cases make for phony targets or other complex things, but at its core make just wants to check for the existence of files
[06:13:43] <RandomReader> which sounds like what this should be?

[06:16:05] <ItsLandon> It's not C++ but I didn't know where else to ask about makefiles.
[06:16:09] <ItsLandon> Ah ok
[06:16:30] <ItsLandon> That's probably a better option. Thanks for the recommendation

[11:16:14] <Simplar> I have a very short program: https://wandbox.org/permlink/bdp4H1qgNm6ImpCU
[11:16:56] <Simplar> It is supposed to find one ANY nonzero integer solution for an equation x/u + y/v = (x+y)/(u+v)
[11:17:49] <Simplar> First line of stdin is the amount of pairs of u and v for equations
[11:18:12] <Simplar> I have to output a solution for the abovementioned equation for given NATURAL numbers u and v

[16:53:55] <traxex> no, the pointer you give to `delete` must come from `new`
[16:54:25] <mort> right
[16:54:43] <mort> I suppose that makes sense given you can overload operator new and operator delete
[16:55:36] <traxex> second paragraph in http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.delete
[16:56:19] <traxex> so it would be UB to pass a malloc'd pointer to delete

[20:52:34] <Raziel> because you need to know if min and/or max exist at all first, and yeah, checking by null doesn't do that, since they're not currently pointers. that's just checking if it's 0. and 0 is a valid value for them.

[21:04:42] <Raziel> it's just them being pointers that's the important change
[21:05:53] <Raziel> but also, nullptr doesn't let you compare it to non-pointers, or assign it to non-pointers. so it would've prevented you from doing what you did in there.

[22:19:26] <RandomReader> udet - why is there a need for reinterpret_cast?
[22:22:51] <RandomReader> (I ask because most of the cases where reinterpret_cast is defined also happen to be cases where static_cast works, so if that's not an option then you'd be missing the same information needed to do any static checks...)

[22:26:11] <RandomReader> example 3 of is_pointer_interconvertible_base_of is false because it's no longer standard-layout, meaning the layouts of the two types are no longer guaranteed to be equivalent
[22:26:47] <RandomReader> polymorphic types are never standard layout, so your interface situation will never be defined

[23:56:29] <Raziel> rip
[23:56:35] <Raziel> LordKalma, why preview tho when release is out
[23:57:00] <LordKalma> Preview gets you previews of the minors as well
[23:58:26] <Raziel> that's true, but, doesn't it also break more often? :p
[23:58:50] <Raziel> and does it have a "you are free to release shit built with this license"?
[23:59:01] <LordKalma> it's actually quite stable
[23:59:08] <LordKalma> and it's the same licence expect minor things
[23:59:38] <Raziel> prior to 2022 release I know the preview didn't have a "you can release shit built with this" license... but I guess ongoing ones do?
[23:59:45] <Raziel> so I might as well stay on preview then? v:
