[03:45:17] <snake> Jigsy, its also referred to torque on a bike to refer to the size of the gears
[03:45:27] <snake> and the number of gears
[03:46:10] <snake> which is similar to the pulley/belt but i imagine pulleys tend to life things in the end
[03:46:32] <snake> but yeah the bike chain goes round, just to turn the wheels
[03:46:38] <snake> so it depends on where you see it
[03:46:50] <snake> like in an engine it is turning things, not lifting
[03:46:58] <snake> or on a bike.. it is turning the wheels
[03:47:36] <snake> maybe i still need one more if you still dont count the socket piece
[03:48:55] <snake> can opener
[03:49:03] <snake> can openers have that knob you need to turn
[03:49:11] <snake> tho idk maybe that falls under "hands" lol
[03:49:27] <snake> or maybe we should omit hands
[03:49:32] <snake> i guess you've lost interest tho
[03:50:00] <snake> Jigsy, does a crowbar make torque in some cases?
[03:50:07] <snake> perhaps, if you are opening a door
[03:50:12] <snake> so i will add crowbar to the list
[03:50:31] <snake> so that's at least 5
[03:51:02] <snake> Jigsy, im not saying i would watch porn if it were illegal, but i could
[03:51:13] <snake> so idk i mean whats the point
[03:51:27] <snake> if people dont like porn they should just avoid it for themselves
[03:54:59] <ButterNoodle> fucking komisan subs are a shit show
[03:56:24] <snake> aye, will avoid ty
[03:56:34] <snake> i like subsplease and maybe erai-saws
[03:57:07] <snake> :v
[03:57:11] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[03:57:13] <snake> but im not much of a critique i suppose
[03:57:22] <ButterNoodle> well netflix are cockblockin official
[03:57:37] <ButterNoodle> is it netflix?
[03:57:45] <ButterNoodle> whoever
[03:57:52] <snake> oof
[03:58:28] <ButterNoodle> levers produce torque btw its not just rotational force
[03:58:41] <Jigsy> Irrational force, eh?
[03:58:48] <Jigsy> Oh, rotational.
[03:59:01] <ButterNoodle> well if u get a rash from it you may be doing it wrong
[03:59:03] <MootPoot> Irrational force? Oh, that's just my penis.
[04:01:26] <snake> lol
[04:03:59] <snake> btw i found out how to get ugoira animations from pixiv
[04:04:24] <snake> with the metadata containing the specific links and even the delay between each frame
[04:05:27] <snake> as well as the order of the frames (tho idk if i was wrong before about the frames being scrambled, might have just been my potato framerate over SPICE vnc)
[04:05:48] <snake> (framerate has improved since then)

[04:52:14] <amigojapan> Hi oops MootPoot

[04:53:05] <Nanobot> I wrote a song with deep meaningful lyrics
[04:53:24] <snake> i love it
[04:53:35] <snake> such rhyme, very wow
[04:54:01] <snake> Nanobot, i found out how to download ugoiras from pixiv btw
[04:54:25] <Nanobot> I wrote a script to do that for me, and convert it to a webm.
[04:54:31] <snake> whoaaa
[04:54:41] <snake> we did the same thing
[04:54:41] *** Joins: oops (~oops@2409:8a62:3c10:2170:e801:1763:6ac2:d24a)
[04:54:49] <snake> why did you tell me to use youtube-dl for pixiv then
[04:54:49] <Nanobot> ugoiras are basically just zip files of standard images.
[04:54:54] <Nanobot> And a file with some timing info
[04:54:56] <snake> were you pretending to not know how to do it
[04:55:19] <Nanobot> Probably because that's easier.
[04:55:28] <snake> it doesn't support pixiv tho
[04:55:43] <Nanobot> To be fair, I don't remember saying to use youtube-dl for pixiv.
[04:56:04] <snake> do you remember us discussing this before?
[04:57:31] <Nanobot> I'm trying to search for it in my logs.
[04:58:04] <snake> oh its ok you dont have to if you dont want to
[04:58:14] <snake> i guess its just not interesting haha
[04:59:39] <snake> Nanobot, maybe someone else told me that? or maybe i confabulated it idk
[05:00:15] <snake> oh right didnt you say your script was written in php and uses a bunch of libraries and stuff?
[05:00:21] <MootPoot> Damn, sounds like Nanobot has a big log
[05:00:32] <MootPoot> :3
[05:00:42] <snake> i was more interested in using node.js and things like curl, wget, gzip etc
[05:00:45] <Nanobot> snake: Looking at the logs, you asked me about turning zipped jpg files into a video. I asked you to clarify, and you said you were trying to scrape videos. And I said I usually use youtube-dl for that. I don't think you mentioned ugoira specifically.
[05:01:20] <snake> ah ok, my memory was correct then but i only understood it from my perspective
[05:01:34] <snake> i didnt explain very well at the time then
[05:01:45] <snake> or perhaps i was trying to be private idk

[05:03:06] <Jigsy> Nothing you do on the Internet is private.
[05:03:13] <snake> nah im fucked
[05:03:16] <Nanobot> snake: My script is part of my general web scraping system, which is closely integrated with my media manager. The ugoira code also depends on ffmpeg and some other stuff.
[05:03:29] <Jigsy> I used to download math porn descretely.
[05:03:35] <snake> might as well just give up and wear a shirt that says "okaeri nano ja" and a picture of senko on it around campus

[05:04:10] <Jigsy> It makes me sad.
[05:04:11] <MootPoot> you're saying the govt and my isp knows my fetishes Jigsy 
[05:04:21] <snake> Jigsy, i dont have japanese installed yet
[05:04:23] <Jigsy> ISP logs traffic, so... yeah?
[05:04:29] <MootPoot> perv
[05:04:32] <Jigsy> I've been faking my traffic for years, though.
[05:04:45] <snake> MootPoot, i try to realize im not a high priority to watch, they are more concerned with terrorists
[05:05:28] <snake> Nanobot, how do you convert to webm? do you get the average framerate or do you actually do it more robustly than that? because ugoira support a delay paramter for each frame
[05:05:46] <snake> i was just watching the images as a jpg sequence so far lol
[05:08:35] <amigojapan> In Japan they are legally allowed to ask your ISP for your data
[05:08:51] <amigojapan> And write tap phones

[05:22:17] <snake> i want to try it but im stuck in my ways LOL
[05:24:00] <MootPoot> for the absolute lowest effort way tbh its teh crock pot
[05:24:02] <MootPoot> not even joking
[05:24:21] <snake> yeah
[05:24:22] <MootPoot> it takes more effort to make 3 microwave meals /sandwiches etc
[05:24:33] <snake> i love chicken alfredo pasta
[05:24:39] <snake> can you make that in the crock pot
[05:24:41] <MootPoot> you just  throw veges, some meat, and water + spices and oil in the crock pot
[05:24:47] <MootPoot> and then eat it all day
[05:24:51] <snake> hmm
[05:25:03] <snake> ok i will get one, the one i inherited is too big so i will try to buy one

[05:25:12] <MootPoot> snake: just use the big one
[05:25:24] <MootPoot> the idea of a crock pot is that you make food and you eat from it like 2 days straight

[07:24:22] <MootPoot> The monthly pass is like 120 dollars
[07:24:28] <MootPoot> Or something
[07:24:43] <amigojapan> Too expensive

[07:26:27] <MootPoot> Within the city

[07:31:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: oh the Japanese monthly passes are much cheaper but are limited to certain routes. If you can go anywhere then it's cheap
[07:32:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: not a good time to open the border
[07:33:00] <MootPoot> It's limited to only the city you're in however
[07:33:05] <MootPoot> Not inter city
[07:33:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's ok for every day commute tho
[07:33:53] <MootPoot> Now with covid idk what's going to happen to public transit
[07:34:18] <MootPoot> They removed a lot of the bus route due to low use
[07:34:23] <amigojapan> Yeah Corona is a problem
[07:34:32] <MootPoot> Now you have to carpool a bus
[07:34:50] <amigojapan> Japan has more people that only use public transport
[07:34:53] <MootPoot> If you want to go somewhere out of the dense zones 
[07:35:17] <MootPoot> Sign up. Then hope at least 10 or something other people in your area want to go that day

[07:41:57] <MootPoot> Windows has one 
[07:42:07] <ButterNoodle> not a computer user..
[07:42:18] <ButterNoodle> fuck windows
[07:42:20] <MootPoot> Explain this broken boot partition
[07:42:25] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: stuff like that should not break
[07:42:28] <ButterNoodle> I caould be a dick

[07:42:40] <MootPoot> Fucking in a window where everyone can see
[07:42:47] <ButterNoodle> didnt rtfm/wiki/news page before updating
[07:43:08] <ButterNoodle> didnt check boot before rebooting
[07:43:16] <MootPoot> So Linux makes a seperate partition on its os drive 
[07:43:22] <MootPoot> Where it boots from?
[07:43:25] <ButterNoodle> sometimes
[07:43:27] <MootPoot> And that broke?
[07:43:30] <ButterNoodle> depends on how u set it up
[07:43:36] <ButterNoodle> but in this case yes.
[07:43:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it just messed with the files in there
[07:43:54] <ButterNoodle> most likely a broke/interrupted initrd image creation
[07:44:08] <ButterNoodle> its the bootloader for the kernel
[07:44:30] <ButterNoodle> kinda
[07:44:41] <ButterNoodle> *bootstrap is a better word
[07:45:29] <ButterNoodle> I've had as many windows boot failures after updates as I have with arch
[07:45:29] <MootPoot> So would like a system restore or something fix it?
[07:45:37] <MootPoot> Rollback?
[07:46:50] <ButterNoodle> short version.. boot the livecd, mount the partitions, and chroot into them.. rerun the initrd creation and check /boot and logs like you should have after the upgrade and before the reboot - then reboot and be happy
[07:47:10] <ButterNoodle> dont need no complicated rollback
[07:47:31] <amigojapan> MootPoot: anyway rolling distros cause small things to keep on breaking. I had already fixed many of them. I am sick of that
[07:47:44] <ButterNoodle> I mean if it was a VM I would have snapshotted and rolled it back
[07:48:59] <amigojapan> Rolling distros are full of bugs
[07:49:11] <ButterNoodle> untrue
[07:49:32] <amigojapan> You need to keep on fixing stupid things that go bad
[07:50:06] <ButterNoodle> I mean, the only things I have had to fix are things I didnt pay attention to
[07:50:19] <ButterNoodle> like when arch switched from initd to systemd..

[10:54:21] <Satin> That he was planning to do it apparently
[10:54:40] <theholyduck> People say stupid shit on the internet all the time though
[10:54:58] <theholyduck> And we don't live in a totalitarian system
[10:55:08] <theholyduck> Cant monitor everyone all the time
[10:55:57] <theholyduck> It's being weirdly complicated by the new government taking charge today
[10:56:09] <Satin> how?

[10:56:41] <theholyduck> All the people in charge of all the relevant departments swap in 30 minutes
[10:56:57] <Satin> ??????????????????????
[10:57:04] <Satin> why would would that matter
[10:57:08] <Satin> they can work together
[10:57:15] <Satin> for a while
[10:57:28] <Satin> how does a government administration change at the top suddenly change everyone
[10:58:06] <theholyduck> It matters for like doing press on this or deciding who goes where or like how a national display of mourning will be done
[10:58:45] <theholyduck> Most/all of the lower level people stay in place of course
[10:58:51] <Satin> no offense but
[10:58:57] <theholyduck> But lot of the high level jobs are swapping
[10:58:58] <Satin> a national day of mourning over 5 people dying?
[10:59:05] <Satin> Bruh
[10:59:45] <theholyduck> This isn't America. Like if 2 people get murdered in a week that's like a ton
[10:59:53] <Satin> ._.
[11:00:13] <Satin> Well
[11:00:18] <Satin> Your entire country's population
[11:00:24] <Satin> is smaller than my home state's
[11:00:27] <Satin> about a million less
[11:00:41] <Satin> and yet my home state has murders now and there 
[11:00:44] <Satin> St. Louis etc
[11:01:20] <theholyduck> Sure. But like the murder rate is like less than 30  a year every year for the last 30
[11:01:28] <theholyduck> Outside of 2011
[11:02:04] <theholyduck> 5 is a extreme event by our measures
[11:02:15] <Satin> 16k homocides in 2018
[11:02:17] <Satin> in missouri
[11:02:31] <Satin> ............ okay
[11:02:37] <Satin> It's hard to warp my head around ngl
[11:02:43] <theholyduck> So that's 16k for how many people living there?
[11:03:00] <Satin> missouri pop: 6.137 million
[11:03:17] <Satin> Norway pop: 5.379 million
[11:03:23] <theholyduck> Yeah we have 30  total
[11:03:30] <Satin> lol
[11:03:40] <theholyduck> Sure thats not a national number?
[11:04:08] <Satin> so
[11:04:08] <Satin> https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/missouri/gun-violence-missouri/article248131395.html
[11:04:10] <theholyduck> 16k for 6 million sounds like a hellohole

[11:04:28] <Satin> > They were among 689 people shot and killed in Missouri in 2020, a year that will likely be recorded as the state‚Äôs deadliest ever for gun violence.

[11:04:54] <ImoutoBot> [] 4MB
[11:05:17] <theholyduck> So that's 700 shot per 6 million
[11:05:38] <theholyduck> Yeah I don't think the 16k number is right
[11:06:29] <theholyduck> I think that's the number for all of America
[11:06:35] <Satin> yeah oops
[11:06:40] <Satin> i was reading the google meta page description
[11:06:50] <Satin> and the stupid site was showing it for national rather than missouri
[11:06:55] <Satin> even tho the page was supposed to be about missouri
[11:06:57] <Satin> ANYWAYS
[11:07:02] <Satin> 700 shootings
[11:07:06] <Satin> idk about homocides of all forms
[11:08:26] <theholyduck> Yeah either way. 5 extra people is like 15% increase in murders for us
[11:08:38] <theholyduck> I imagine there will be something
[11:08:55] <Satin> "Missouri is one of only eight states nationwide with a violent crime rate of more than 500 incidents per 100,000. Crime in Missouri is generally concentrated in major cities. In St. Louis, for example, there were 1,800.4 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in 2018, nearly five times the national violent crime rate of 380.6 per 100,000.
[11:08:55] <Satin> The murder rate in Missouri is particularly high. There were 607 homicides in the state in 2018, equal to 9.9 for every 100,000 people, the second highest murder rate of any state, after only Lousiana."
[11:09:33] <Satin> what's your crime rate per 100,000
[11:11:30] <Satin> "In 2018, Norway had a murder rate of 0.53 per 100,000 population. There were a total of 25 murders in Norway in 2018.[2]"
[11:11:51] <Satin> 0.53 vs 9.9
[11:12:00] <theholyduck> General violent crime is low aswell

[13:01:28] <Satin> same as my laptop
[13:01:30] <Sadale> Satin, that's a nice laptop you've got
[13:01:30] <Satin> except mine is 2020
[13:01:43] <Satin> ty
[13:01:47] <Satin> it's powering 3 screens rn
[13:02:01] <Satin> lol as we can see
[13:02:06] <Sadale> Satin, you rich. Mine is a 2400G desktop, 16GB RAM with 1TB SSD. No dedi graphic card.
[13:02:07] <Satin> bco literally only launched his laptop to flex on us
[13:02:08] <Bco1981> i miss the number pad
[13:02:10] <Satin> >uptime: 24s
[13:02:14] <Bco1981> :P
[13:02:17] <Satin> 25s*
[13:02:20] <Satin> LMFAO
[13:02:27] <Sadale> So Bco1981 is the richest. Satin seconds to him. And Sadale is the poorest :D
[13:02:31] <Bco1981> i needed to test a usb-c to hdmi anyway
[13:02:35] <Satin> Sadale: eh i got this for 1.3k USD
[13:02:39] <Sadale> woah
[13:02:43] <Satin> when it's normally 1.7k USD
[13:02:45] <Sadale> 1.3k USD is quite a lot
[13:02:46] <Satin> i got it used slightly yeah
[13:02:49] <Satin> but with 24 GB ram
[13:02:59] <Satin> 1.3k isn't that much in terms of laptop prices
[13:03:03] <Satin> like it's a lot
[13:03:07] <Satin> but it's not uncommon
[13:03:11] <Sadale> mine is like 600~700 USD.
[13:03:19] <Sadale> I built mine on my own tho
[13:03:37] <Sadale> My first laptop was like $400 xD
[13:03:58] <Sadale> Nah it's just me being frugal. :P

[13:05:54] <Satin> i was saving up for a while???
[13:05:55] <Sadale> pocket money from your parents? Or did you make the money from your jobs?
[13:05:59] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: yeah
[13:06:06] <Satin> Sadale: i don't remember
[13:06:08] <Sadale> ah
[13:06:11] <Satin> probably a bit of both, but i did work
[13:06:14] <Bco1981_2> Sadale, it's confirmed... it's the Oculus headset the don't want to play nicely.
[13:06:17] <Sadale> Satin, I envy you xD
[13:06:21] <Satin> why
[13:06:23] <Sadale> Bco1981_2, oh congratz.
[13:06:28] <Sadale> Bco1981_2, at least the laptop's intact.
[13:06:38] <Sadale> Satin, because you've got a better computer than I do
[13:06:39] <Bco1981_2> when i plug in this usb-c to hdmi i can see it connects to the 3080
[13:06:41] <Satin> you graduated and have a job, I've been set back 
[13:06:48] <Satin> lol
[13:06:50] <Bco1981_2> *using my tv
[13:07:04] <Sadale> Not right now. Maybe I'll upgrade my computer some days later
[13:07:21] <Sadale> So far I don't really need a better computer. I just do some programming and shit and I don't play heavy games/
[13:07:38] <Sadale> I do play those silly flash games tho. But they don't require much computational power.
[13:08:02] <Satin> yeah i don't need that much more power either
[13:08:15] <Satin> I just treat it as an investment, it's nice to have around and hopefully will last for some years
[13:08:31] <Satin> i've only used laptops but get tired when they can't run things i want to from time to time so this sounds like a good one

[13:12:36] <JesseDesu> bco you mean like the fan noise
[13:12:38] <Sadale> JesseDesu, Does the hub has external power supply tho? If not I doubt that it'd be able to power 4 HDD. Even if it has it it may not be able to power 4 of them
[13:12:44] <Bco1981_2> JesseDesu, yeah
[13:12:46] <Sadale> JesseDesu, That's because HDD takes shitton of power.

[13:13:16] <JesseDesu> 12v or 7amps
[13:13:21] <Sadale> That's 18A.
[13:13:27] <JesseDesu> oh it is
[13:13:32] <JesseDesu> i dunno electrical math
[13:13:35] <Sadale> 90W/5V = 18A.
[13:13:51] <JesseDesu> hold on lemme open  the box
[13:13:55] <JesseDesu> i havent opened it yet lol
[13:13:59] <Sadale> If the PSU's 12V@7A tho that'd be 84W only.
[13:13:59] <JesseDesu> still in amazon packaging
[13:14:32] <JesseDesu> oh man its a hefty box
[13:14:41] <JesseDesu> with a heavy power brick
[13:14:50] <Sadale> The thing is 12V to 5V conversion isn't 100% efficient. So let's assume that it's 60% efficient. Then you get 12V*7A/5V*60% = 10A.
[13:15:16] <JesseDesu> made in china

[13:50:29] <Sadale> Food and luxury and electronics here's cheap tho.
[13:50:36] <Sadale> So is the salary :P
[13:50:45] <Sadale> But the tax rate is rather low here.
[13:51:44] <Sadale> The salary tax here's up to 15%ish. There's no sales tax. Most of the stuffs here are tax-free with a few exceptions like apartments, cars, tobacco.

[14:01:23] <death916> i mean...
[14:02:02] <Sadale> Probably wise for me to pay for that. Otherwise it'd be my stupid dad who's paying for that. If I'm paying for that it means that my dad would have one less thing to nag for.
[14:02:16] <Sadale> This stupid dad nags for everything. He's a drama generator.

[16:56:56] <Bco1981> pfft
[16:57:09] <ButterNoodle> new 4tb?
[16:57:16] <ButterNoodle> it worked inside right
[16:57:26] <Bco1981> i can use usb-c for my 3.0 oculs trackers.
[16:57:31] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: brand new
[16:57:35] <Bco1981> both case and ssd
[16:57:40] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I feel it is booting really fast, I have an HDD still
[16:57:43] <Bco1981> just unpacked 10 minutes ago
[16:57:58] <ButterNoodle> try it direct connect.. doa?
[16:57:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: congrats on the computer runnage
[16:58:30] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: fastest would be testing a 2.5" hdd in the case.
[16:58:39] <DunceCotus> use firewire
[16:58:57] <amigojapan> Ty DunceCotus it took me like 4 months to get around to it
[16:59:24] <DunceCotus> ah cool
[16:59:45] <amigojapan> I want to buy an SSD for my laptop. But I am not sure what kind of SSD to get for it
[17:01:05] <ButterNoodle> anything is fine
[17:01:28] <ButterNoodle> samsung is the best.. crucial are good
[17:02:24] <ButterNoodle> kingston are shit tier.. but they work and the failure rate isnt bad
[17:02:38] <ButterNoodle> anything is fine tho
[17:02:46] <Bco1981> i guess the case is doa. two working hdd's don't show up with this case.
[17:03:31] <DunceCotus> get a Logitech
[17:03:49] <Bco1981> ssd shows up with a 2.5" usb2.0 case
[17:04:06] <Bco1981> guess that will have to do for now.
[17:04:14] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I guess I need to open my laptop and see the size of the hard disk
[17:04:15] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: its probably faulty usb3 drivers, update windows
[17:04:51] <ButterNoodle> they are all 2.5
[17:04:52] <DunceCotus> even if it means breaking a bunch of other stuff
[17:04:56] <Bco1981> usb3 mem sticks work. why should this usb3 case then that says in the manual it supports win10/win10-64
[17:05:02] <amigojapan> Ah ok ButterNoodle 
[17:05:23] <ButterNoodle> unless u want nvme
[17:05:27] <Bco1981> tested on my work laptop too that most certainly is up tp date.
[17:05:33] <ButterNoodle> what laptop?
[17:05:36] <Bco1981> to*
[17:05:43] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: device manager -> uninstall controller driver -> brick computer -> reinstall Windows 98
[17:05:44] <Bco1981> lenovo thinkpad thing
[17:05:50] <Bco1981> lol
[17:06:16] <Bco1981> oh... the usb2.0 case is limited to 1.6tb...
[17:06:21] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: are they all SATA?
[17:06:38] <DunceCotus> SA-TA-KA
[17:07:07] <Bco1981> actually you can get IDE ssd's

[17:07:22] <Bco1981> have been thinking of trying one for a old pc
[17:07:30] <Bco1981> maybe my first laptop
[17:07:39] <Bco1981> could be fun to get it working again.
[17:08:31] <HeTo> one option is a compact flash card with an adapter
[17:08:55] <DunceCotus> zip disks
[17:09:20] <HeTo> got one for my Pentium laptop. the card is quick enough that the bottleneck is the PATA controller
[17:09:45] <Bco1981> https://www.transcend-info.com/Embedded/Products/No-836
[17:09:54] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: what laptop, if it has nvme Id get that
[17:09:54] <ImoutoBot> [title] PSD330 | 2.5" PATA SSDs - Transcend Information, Inc.
[17:10:03] <HeTo> CF is the same as PATA, just a different form factor for the connector, so the adapter should be really cheap
[17:10:21] <ButterNoodle> yuck Bco1981 
[17:10:36] <Bco1981> HeTo: but isn't the write speed of CF very low ?
[17:10:42] <ButterNoodle> yes
[17:10:43] <Bco1981> or is that just cisco CF's
[17:10:44] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it's a really old laptop with an HDD in it
[17:10:57] <ButterNoodle> life expectancy is low too
[17:10:59] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it may be ide
[17:11:10] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: is it p4?
[17:11:29] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: i3 core duo
[17:11:33] <ButterNoodle> not i-
[17:11:44] <Bco1981> either i3, or a core2 duo
[17:11:48] <ButterNoodle> 99% sure sata
[17:11:52] <Bco1981> can't be both at the same time :)
[17:11:52] <amigojapan> Let me see
[17:11:58] <DunceCotus> compact fasch
[17:12:02] <HeTo> Bco1981: I haven‚Äôt noticed any slowness with the write speed either. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs still faster than the HDD the computer used to have before it broke.
[17:12:27] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: ... cat proc cpuinfo?
[17:12:36] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: core TM inside
[17:12:44] <HeTo> a modern generic CF card is probably quite different from something designed to house the firmware for a router in the 1990s (so doesn‚Äôt need to be written that often)
[17:12:56] <amigojapan> Ok ButterNoodle let me try that
[17:13:24] <Bco1981> HeTo: but isn't life expectancy on CF still very low compaired to a ssd ?
[17:14:11] <Bco1981> would be nice with a pentium 233 MMX with a ssd drive.
[17:14:47] <HeTo> Bco1981: probably not. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had an SD card break on me either, except one that broke almost new
[17:14:53] <Bco1981> those old spinning drives... the whine they make.
[17:15:27] <Bco1981> okay, i'm just only really experienced CF's in yeah... old dying routers.
[17:15:32] <Bco1981> and switches
[17:15:38] <ButterNoodle> they are shit
[17:15:50] <Bco1981> really suck when they are soldered...
[17:16:12] <DunceCotus> just use a 64 meg usb 1.1 stick
[17:16:13] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: hardinfo says i3, sticker says core
[17:16:22] <ButterNoodle> there is a reason cf wasnt used in servers due to read/write duty cycle
[17:16:40] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: i don't think the mobo for the pentium even has usb.10
[17:16:44] <Bco1981> 1.0*
[17:16:48] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: ok ur "core i-3" as they called it.. probably first gen
[17:16:50] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: storage says ATA
[17:16:51] <ButterNoodle> still sata
[17:16:58] <ButterNoodle> O.o
[17:17:02] <Bco1981> amigojapan: core i3
[17:17:15] <amigojapan> Ah ok Bco1981 
[17:17:17] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: there's always 8 inch floppy
[17:17:44] <DunceCotus> core i3? Old skool
[17:18:06] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: use smartctl to see what the drive model is inside it already
[17:18:12] <ButterNoodle> that would tell u if its sata
[17:18:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: got it for 100usd about 5 years ago
[17:18:21] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: you wern't here when i logged in with my pentium 3 ?
[17:18:31] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: no?
[17:18:56] <Bco1981> well i put it back in my basement so i can't do it now.
[17:18:56] <amigojapan> Ty ButterNoodle 
[17:19:48] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: and it had too little ram(384mb) so i can't install raspberry OS on it
[17:20:07] <ButterNoodle> rip
[17:20:08] <Bco1981> so i can't get hexchat on it and do the systeminfo.
[17:20:13] <Bco1981> had to rely on mirc
[17:20:16] <ButterNoodle> I think thats what one of my P3s has in it
[17:20:25] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: 384mb still seems a lot for a Pentium 3
[17:20:25] <ButterNoodle> dell gx 110
[17:20:34] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it says it's SCSI
[17:20:39] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: yeah, is maxed out
[17:20:39] <ButterNoodle> :|
[17:20:42] <ButterNoodle> whats the drive model
[17:20:52] <ButterNoodle> with the -a switch it should tell u
[17:21:00] <ButterNoodle> then google that model and it will tell u the interface
[17:21:05] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: let me Google the drive model
[17:21:08] <ButterNoodle> scsi is the command set
[17:21:16] <ButterNoodle> so still probably sata

[18:26:48] <darkwitch> yes, let us all indulge in carbohydrate orgies
[18:28:30] <HubertFarnsworth> As an Asian, I live on carbohydrates.
[18:29:09] <Roey> what? I thought rice was bad and that people can't possibleye live on eating rice every day
[18:29:21] <Roey> despite the billion-plus Asians who say that they do
[18:29:28] <HubertFarnsworth> We eat rice every day
[18:29:40] <Roey> !!!horror of horrors!!!
[18:29:52] <Roey> next thing you know.. what.. sweet potatoes are also okay to eat???
[18:30:06] <HubertFarnsworth> It is bad as you see how people are becoming diabetic here
[18:30:14] <Roey> ahaaaa
[18:30:15] <Roey> I mean
[18:30:21] <Roey> well I'm being facetious
[18:30:25] <Roey> of course rice is good
[18:30:37] <Roey> certainly better than the oil- and salt-laden crap that people gobble up
[18:31:11] <amigojapan> Roey: not for diabetes
[18:31:31] <HubertFarnsworth> Having same kind of diet every day is bad regardless of what kind of diet one is having.
[18:31:53] <HubertFarnsworth> Varied, rich diet is better
[18:31:58] <Roey> amigojapan: the diabetes comes from cheese/milk/chicken/eggs/meat/fish and foods with oils and fats added to hem
[18:31:59] <Roey> them
[18:32:12] <Roey> I don't think a rich diet is necessarily better
[18:32:27] <Roey> on the other hand, a diet that limits damaging foods is better
[18:32:35] <Roey> bbiab
[18:32:46] <amigojapan> No roey it comes from carbs and sugars. Tomako was able to quit insulin
[18:32:53] <HubertFarnsworth> That‚Äôs alright because science doesn‚Äôt care about our personal opinions.
[18:34:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Does he know that there are like millions of vegans here?

[18:43:14] <HubertFarnsworth> Nice
[18:45:13] <Roey> <amigojapan> No roey it comes from carbs and sugars. Tomako was able to quit insulin <- those carbs and sugars swirl around in the bloodstream because they can't get to where they need to be, which is pushed through the muscle cell walls and stored for energy as glycogen.  The reason they can't push into the muscle cell walls is because the "keyhole" that ferries them across needs insulin to ferry the carbs through, however, oil clogs this "keyhole" up and 
[18:45:14] <Roey> prevents insulin from fitting into it.  So the insulin doesn't fit into the keyhole, and the carbs can't get through the muscle cell walls, and that's why we see high bloodstream carbs in diabetes patients.

[18:58:12] <ButterNoodle> its basic math... if u dont burn what u eat it will be glucose in ur system until it can be converted to fats
[18:58:29] <ButterNoodle> the body converts the easiest things to glucose first - carbs
[18:59:01] <ButterNoodle> so if ur eating carbs with fats.. the fats will just float around in ur blood clogging arteries etc
[18:59:15] <ButterNoodle> as with everything .. moderation
[19:00:54] <HubertFarnsworth> But I rack disciprane
[19:00:55] <ButterNoodle> I have been eating less than 20 grams of carbs a day for 3 years.. and 40-100x the amount of fat you would be advised to eat.. I have lost 40-50lbs, my blood glucose levels have gone from borderline diabetic to low normal numbers, and my blood pressure is normal from borderline hypertension..
[19:01:33] <Roey> <ButterNoodle> its basic math... if u dont burn what u eat it will be glucose in ur system until it can be converted to fats <- no, it will be burned as heat by muscles.  Unless you consume sugars in a way saturates your liver, then it turns thme into fat.  But that doesn't happen when you eat whole foods, because fiber and water fill you up before you can ever overeat on the sugars in the fruits/vegetables.
[19:02:54] <Roey> <ButterNoodle> so if ur eating carbs with fats.. the fats will just float around in ur blood clogging arteries etc <- the fats plug up the insulin receptors on your muscle cell walls, and then glucose can't get through them to be stored as glycogen for energey

[19:46:23] <Sadale> actually with quick googling I've found a device that could be used for measuring heart rate. But it requires me to lay a finger on the device.
[19:47:22] <Sadale> If I want to masturbate with both of my hands, that may not work. Anyway it may be good enough for preliminary research. Just to find out if I could actually use my heartrate data for help edging myself without cumming. :P

[19:48:40] <Sadale> for preliminary reserach, yes. For final use, I'd very much like to have a heart rate measurement device that can be attached to myself. Like maybe on my wrist, or on one of my feet. Then I could use both of my hands on my cock

[22:04:19] <ButterNoodle> I have a 20 year old blade grinder.. and I grind even enough for press and pour over

[22:50:06] <MootPoot> is it?
[22:51:02] <MootPoot> press dosen't need seperately boiled water, dosent need filters , dosent need some fancy ass hipster pouring technique, only has one self contained thing rather then funnel+kettle thing +coffee pot
[22:51:47] <S_T_A_N> It also makes very grainy coffee because of not using filters

[23:50:37] <Margarita^Night> OH, along those lines I also love Prince of Tennis and Hikaru no Go
[23:50:44] <Margarita^Night> MootPoot:  fair
[23:51:12] <TheBlurstOfTimes> Margarita^Night: so, the concept is called Sakuga, and it's typically in scenes where the animators spend the most money on, because it is extremely precie and smooth in animation.  Here's an example, with food: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DPcwGLI4iU
