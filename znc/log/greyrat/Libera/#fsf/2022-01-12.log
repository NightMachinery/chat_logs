[00:03:06] <sven792> Should the government needs to license their stuff under a copyleft license if they publish it?
[00:06:28] <jacobk> In the U.S. government work is public domain in most cases I think, so copyleft by governments would be unenforcable anyway.
[00:08:57] <yrk> sven792: those are very broad questions. in my opinion, as long as the world is overrun by proprietary software, we need to encourage copyleft. in a world where most software is freedom-respecting, copyleft would become onerous. this is analogous to weapons of various kinds: justified in a world full of oppressors, unjust in an otherwise peaceful world (so you can tell, I'm neither a lax-license supporter, nor a pacifist)
[00:10:32] <kompowiec> yrk: based
[00:11:22] <sven792> interesting thought
[00:11:49] <jacobk> I think, if there are going to be rules requiring copyleft, there should be exceptions for when contributing to non-copyleft software.

[00:16:46] <yrk> jacobk: the question was about schools and governments; both places where people are subjected to tons of arbitrary rules. my answer would be different if the question was "should _everyone_ be forced to release copyleft"
[00:17:26] <yrk> if someone has a problem with following rules and regulations, no matter how petty and dumb, they shouldn't be in a school or work for a government
[00:18:19] <irelativism> alMalsamo: that is the reason why garlic routing was created has alternative to onion routers

[00:19:35] <jacobk> yrk: I don't think that's a good reason to add more petty rules, and the harm could still occur.
[00:23:29] <jacobk> If someone believes everything should be public domain, and people adding proprietary extensions to their software hasn't changed their mind, schools/governments adding copyleft extensions probably also won't change their mind.

[00:46:42] *** Joins: isf (~iShareFre@user/isharefreedom)
[00:48:44] <irelativism> copyleft is used, is absolutely fair to request someone that is using my code to release their improvements, if that is not acceptable that is fine I invite you to spent 5 years building your own codebase. not because I dont want you to not to have freedom of choice but because according to current copyright law the whole codebase could be closed without me having any say on it

[00:53:07] <jacobk> Yes, I agree that copyleft should be used in this case.
[00:53:25] <irelativism> now aply this to your example somone has a permissive codebase that allows you to relicense however you want as long as there is copyright atribution, ok fine copyleft already respects that by default so I repecting you demands. But now on top of your 5 years of development I added 2 years of my own development and again given current copyright law and because I dont want that codebase to be abused and closed I need to request for every
[00:53:25] <irelativism> derivitave works to be FOSS as well which is more then fair because nobody is obliged to use my codebase if they wish they can spent 2 years building their own and create their own and relize it under diferent license is as simple as that sorry for the blunteness, but that is how cutthrought copyright law is structured nowadays, and the reason why the need for copyleft exists jacobk

[00:56:15] <irelativism> On the other end this is a prblem with copyleft, that is that is not compatible with the traditional business model, called by many the capitalist business model
[00:56:40] <White_Flame> I would call it the "intellectual property" model
[00:57:06] <irelativism> but that is a totally seperate issue and should not be mixed with licensing, especially now given we already have great alternate business models

[01:00:18] <kompowiec> I am afraid that such a formulation of the interpretation of the fact may be criticized by horseshoe theory.
[01:01:47] <jacobk> I think, although the text of the copyleft license could be the same in both cases, the effect is very different. For copyleft to be effective, it can't just require derivative works to be FOSS; it has to require that they be a specific license or a specific set of licenses. How great the changes are may affect whether it's better to copyleft or not. But if the change is small, it's not worth it to maintain a separate version with the 
[01:01:47] <jacobk> copyleft improvements and effort could be split unnecesarily if anyone (not everyone) is required to copyleft.
[01:01:47] <irelativism> do you have a argument to base that, or will it simply and sadly remain as is, has the baseless acussation that it presents?

[01:02:57] <kompowiec> unfortunately, sometimes people are mean and completely forget the point that the whole movement was based on self-defense against closed source.
[01:04:29] <kompowiec> and it is because of this, and not the horseshoe theory, that it is legitimate.
[01:04:55] <irelativism> you seam to have ignores my refutation to your point, I assure you there are valid arguments there, and if you think there arent please be courages enough to present some proper direct refutations to it, porpously choosing to ignore my arguments is just cowardness.

[01:09:47] <jacobk> Regarding why non-copyleft projects exist, I don't think business is the only reason (though that's certainly why they are popular).
[01:10:17] <irelativism> ? 
[01:10:19] <jacobk> Er, maybe I shouldn't say "certainly" here, but it seems to be why.
[01:10:33] <irelativism> I never said business is the reason copyleft exists
[01:10:43] <kompowiec> irelativism, horseshoe thoery is a theory in which it is claimed that the members of the group with the extreme ideology X and extreme Y are more similar to each other than to the centrist groups. And in this sense, I imagine that people using permissive licenses do not distinguish us from "extremists"
[01:10:46] <jacobk> the reason why non-copyleft still exists, I mean
[01:10:50] <irelativism> quite the opossite actually

[01:11:04] <irelativism> ah ok that makes more sense
[01:11:19] <irelativism> it is exclusivly because of that
[01:11:44] <irelativism> the thing is currently we have other ways to be sustainable but the capitalist way
[01:11:50] <jacobk> Some people are ideologically opposed to copyleft (which, also implies they are ideologically opposed to proprietary software).
[01:12:11] <kompowiec> Well, since I quoted the horseshoe theory, it was not on any other ;)
[01:12:27] <irelativism> look into selfsustaining collectives also called DAOdecentralizedautonomousorganizations by the hype
[01:13:39] <irelativism> what you refer was "us" is not what is extreme here, what is extreme for almost a century now is the state of copyright law
[01:15:09] <irelativism> having all works by default copyrighted, even without requested by the author, and making public domain so hard and burocratic to declare, that has make it almost extinct, and by the way this is not by chance a lot of people make a lot of money because of this.
[01:15:30] <kompowiec> the ultimate line between the absence of horseshoe and its existence is IMO justifying violence. I always observes it with some degree of schadenfreude that any extreme option usually cannot justify it, only claims it should be (that's called is-ought problem).

[01:18:42] <ewwegweg> ı think it is
[01:18:52] <ewwegweg> for  example gitea is more useful
[01:19:16] <irelativism> you shouldnt not blame copyleft but the current copyright laws extreme state
[01:20:04] <irelativism> now, regarding the fact that someone wants to profit from software, true that copyleft makes that extremely dificult byt that is a enterelly diferent discussion
[01:20:38] <irelativism> and the solution for that has nothing to do with copyright, but in the reform of how we do business
[01:21:11] <irelativism> whisch by the way this change is already happening just look at projects like polkadot among others
[01:21:51] <irelativism> radicle, monero are another ones etc...
[01:22:00] <kompowiec> there are many applications that are free software but are paid eg. ardour
[01:22:59] <irelativism> o/ ewwegweg there arent that many maitainers of savannah unfortunatelly much more time and effort was put into things like gitea unfortunatelly
[01:23:27] <kompowiec> or Fritzing Fab
[01:24:21] <irelativism> kompowiec: that is true, is just more dificult under the traditional business model of selling products, also called capitalist business model, where everything is a product, even the people creating that product, by selling their jobs
[01:24:31] <irelativism> in time and effort that is
[01:24:39] <ewwegweg> yes but its truth
[01:25:32] <kompowiec> indeed, the entire industry is in need of a reevaluation.
[01:25:43] <irelativism> sure nobody dispits that ewwegweg ease of use is fortunately not the only thing that matter in software though
[01:26:40] <ewwegweg> in this time fsf dont move the gitea or other.
[01:27:04] <irelativism> is not just this industry the entire economy because this system if products is no longer sustainable for the world

[02:52:07] <AndrewYu> For writing clients where no minimal example is AVAIL, reading protocol specs is great!

[02:58:48] <alMalsamo> I heard Signal might consider allowing signing up with just a username which would be fantastic, but Moxie has usually been adament about requiring a phone number for some retarded reason, but he just stepped down as CEO so maybe there will be change.

Violaters may argue otherwise in court, even though all they can really argue is that x file has no license, which means that file is under your restrictions. A copyright header with your name or unique nickname plus text containing the license should still be done for any non-trivial
[06:45:10] <DiffieHellman> file, as that both dashes are violators arguments, as assists with the reusage of individual files in other projects.

[09:42:09] <jacobk> I think trisquel.info has an example of what you want.
[09:43:03] <jacobk> Basically just have a separate script, also inline, that is just a license and no code, and then put "The following is the entire license notice for the JavaScript code in this page".
[09:43:19] <jacobk> I'm don't know about the legalities, but I think LibreJS will accept that.
[09:44:07] <jacobk> The formatting is a bit odd though. I can post it here if you want, but it's like 20 lines.

[19:53:45] <irelativism> is leah ok ?
[19:54:26] <irelativism> Im concerned about her, she seams to be back to her olds ways on kicking and banning people because they dont agree with her unfortunately
[19:55:00] <irelativism> is quite sad I though he were past that with the departure of swiftgeek from the libreboot project
[19:55:30] <leah> nah you violated my rule that i put down
[19:55:39] <leah> i said: do not talk about or promote known fascists
[19:55:44] <leah> you responded by doing just that
[19:55:57] <leah> cheers
[19:57:13] <irelativism> you desiquilibrated the uberous of libreboot is getting to you ounce again unfortunately
[19:57:44] <irelativism> for the record I never "promoted ...." or whatever bulshit you are claim
[19:58:09] <irelativism> I simply said one cannot confuse ideology one might have with good work
[19:59:09] <irelativism> this coming from what many consider a radical leftwing activists
[19:59:14] <irelativism> *activist
[19:59:27] <irelativism> outside the FOSS movement
[19:59:27] <leah> i also said to move that discussion to #librespeech
[19:59:38] <leah> and you kept spamming
[19:59:51] <irelativism> yes but you are not all mighty god leah 
[19:59:51] <leah> come back when you have something useful to contribute
[20:00:00] <leah> cheers
[20:00:02] <kompowiec> leah, on the other hand, if we are not talking about something, we cannot change it.
[20:00:10] <irelativism> unfortunately your mistakes over the years havent teach you that lesson yet
[20:00:23] <irelativism> one day you will fortunately
[20:00:47] <leah> the hallmark of a troll... is afterwards, they go to spam another channel when they get banned
[20:00:48] <kompowiec> this was the case with the lemmy project, which banished (keyword - past tense) profanity or "forbidden" words
[20:00:52] <leah> leave the fsf out of this lol
[20:00:56] <leah> they don't deserve your bullshit either
[20:01:00] <irelativism> leah: Ego is a very dangerous thing is the reason you were kicked from the GNU project
[20:01:08] <leah> lol are you for real?
[20:01:16] <irelativism> and why you probably cant reconcile with swiftgeek and andrew
[20:01:16] <leah> i didn't get kicked out of gnu
[20:01:26] <leah> i pulled my project out of it by force
[20:01:36] <irelativism> not me duhh the libreboot project
[20:01:37] <leah> (and later regretted that. but the point stands)
[20:01:54] <leah> and i removed swiftgeek/andrew because they were bad devs and running the project into the ground
[20:01:56] <irelativism> sure
[20:02:08] <irelativism> put your ego aside for ounce 
[20:02:22] <leah> i could say the same to you
[20:02:24] <irelativism> and take responsability for your mistakes and grow from them
[20:02:31] <kompowiec> I wasn't talking about the FSF at this point, just in general
[20:02:34] <leah> your ego is as big as your beard
[20:02:54] <leah> just chill
[20:03:11] <leah> and please don't spam #fsf. if you want to argue with me, do it in pm or #librespeech
[20:03:15] <irelativism> and btw if you actually hear what people have to say instead of kicking them imediatly you might actually grow and agree with them in the future
[20:03:16] <leah> do it in #librespeech actually
[20:03:41] <irelativism> if not then just present refutations after the fact
[20:04:05] <irelativism> I assure you gonna drive people away from libreboot ounce againif that attitude continues
[20:04:29] <leah> nope. it's people like you and swiftgeek that were driving others away
[20:04:46] <irelativism> sure if that makes you fell better
[20:04:50] <leah> i purged all that and revived a dead project single handedly, and did 2 releases in 1 year. and am near to another
[20:04:52] <leah> good day
[20:08:07] <leah> (the dead project that i revived was libreboot. it went stale after a bad rewrite starting in late 2016. i purged the rewrite in early 2021 when it was apparent that such was necessary, and forked libreboot from 2016. getting a new release done, completely modernized and up to date on latest coreboot, with several boards added, in mere months. and i'm proud of what i did. i'd do it again)
[20:09:25] <leah> oh, and ever since, i've attracted new devs, people who were previously being turned away by the former devs who i removed
[20:09:38] <leah> so yeah. you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. please get a grip

[20:23:31] <irelativism> so people know what is going on on the libreboot project I dont do well with manipulation and smoke mirrors. vitali64 (artix btw) is easy for you to say that the minimum you should do is defend my position given you were ther. Anyway I need to get back to replicant work. I have to say her attitude ounce again doesnt suprise me 6 time I see it.
