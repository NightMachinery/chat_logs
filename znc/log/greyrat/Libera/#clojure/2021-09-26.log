[16:38:58] <sobel> a true story: some java code my extremely talented peer wrote (scraping/data acquisition) is decaying because of bad assumptions about GC and not having a C++-style destructor. my clojure code in a related role, written when i barely knew clojure, is still one of the most reliable players in my whole crontab.
[16:40:37] <sobel> he's gone, i discovered the GC assumption a bit after a change to jdk11 and one System.gc() removal improved performance but excacerbated a db connection leak
[16:41:06] <sobel> he's good but his only mistakes are pretty hard to make in clojure

[17:10:38] <Para> That's so very 15 years ago.
[17:11:01] <Para> A lot of C/C++ programmers moving to Java would assume GC to be trash and litter their code with System.gc() etc. exactly as you described :)
[17:11:08] <Para> Turns out most of the code like that runs like ass.
[17:12:45] <sobel> i believe it was a bad assumption for jdk8 when it was made, but it's worse now for jdk11
[17:14:05] <sobel> that System.gc() was in a tight spot so removing it earned a nice performance boost but eventually i figured out it caused the app to hang with high CPU utility instead of exiting.
[17:14:51] <sobel> so i could cut the timeout way down with the useful runtime being more predictable
[17:17:08] <Para> Thankfully the threading tricks of old have phased out entirely :)
[17:17:47] <Para> ThreadLocals are still in a lot of places, of course.

[20:59:02] <Ingvix> what would be a good way to loop through sequence when there's need to refer the previous and next items in the sequence during the current iteration?
[21:00:34] <opqdonut> you can do something like `(map (fn [prev cur nxt] ...) sequence (rest sequence) (rest (rest sequence)))`
[21:01:15] <opqdonut> alternatively, you can use `(partition 3 1 sequence)`
[21:01:32] *** Quits: matty_matt (~matt@cpe-98-14-254-37.nyc.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:01:48] <opqdonut> alternatively, you can loop over a list of indexes and index the sequence (inefficient for large lists, ok for vectors of all sizes)
[21:02:46] <Ingvix> the sequence would be a list of 3D vectors with no limit on the amount
[21:06:37] <Ingvix> either at the end or the beginning I would need to refer to the first as next or last as previous to go sort of full circle so the indexed one might be a good fit
[21:07:21] <Ingvix> but I'm not quite sure whether this can or can't be done with the other methods too
[21:07:46] <opqdonut> it sure can
[21:08:00] <opqdonut> you just need to modify the sequence a bit
[21:08:31] <Ingvix> yeah I guess could just add the first as last as well
[21:08:59] <opqdonut> ,(let [xs (range 6)] (partition 3 1 (concat [(last xs)] xs [(first xs)])))  -- e.g.
[21:09:17] <opqdonut> oh, nobot
[21:09:28] <opqdonut> well anyway, that's ((5 0 1) (0 1 2) (1 2 3) (2 3 4) (3 4 5) (4 5 0))
[21:10:51] <opqdonut> btw if it's a long lazy sequence, it might be better to use (concat xs (take 2 xs)) instead, and handle the first element of xs last
[21:11:07] <opqdonut> since computing (last xs) will force the whole sequence
[21:11:50] <Ingvix> yeah, I think I can manage with this knowledge, thanks
