[00:01:11] <tsukasadt> ty you for the help, ljharb and earendel.
[00:01:15] <onosendi> rdrg109: if you do decide to install node: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
[00:02:08] <ljharb> rdrg109: i mean, "across multiple sites" is meaningless because node doesn't have a site

[00:02:26] <ljharb> rdrg109: but yes, it's a server/program so it can make as many requests to URLs as you want
[00:02:47] <earendel> i think i answered the question considering same origin. which really is determined by the url of the main document, which makes it safe for 3rd parties to offer iframe embedments for your site
[00:04:01] <earendel> (the owner of the iframe will be checked for same origin)

[01:51:47] *** Joins: thetoloachekid (~ttk@136.144.43.61)
[01:52:23] <tusko> I have some divs inside of divs, etc. The one I'm interested in is uniquely named, but for some reason my CSS selector isn't grabbing it
[01:53:26] <neshpion> if it's uniquely named, then why not just use only its unique class/id as the selector and nothing else?
[01:53:52] <tusko> I did that and it keeps givving me an empty NodeList
[01:53:59] <tusko> but there should be many elements
[01:53:59] <ThePendulum> sounds like that should be the problem to ask about then :p

[02:04:41] <onosendi> tusko: you're only getting one because you're getting the first index of the node list. If you `console.log(hist)` you'll get your list.
[02:04:41] <tusko> hist[0] is no good?
[02:04:53] <ThePendulum> that means you're getting the first item, which it's showing as expected
[02:04:54] <newton> hist[0] is one HTMLAnchorElement

[02:08:26] <tusko> That's a thing?
[02:08:32] <ThePendulum> uh, I don't know what they mean either
[02:08:33] <newton> data attributes are better for sure
[02:08:35] <ThePendulum> why?
[02:08:48] <onosendi> Because someone could come along and change the CSS and your JS is screwed.
[02:08:56] <onosendi> clases are for styling, data-* is for selecting.

[02:09:13] <ThePendulum> that depends on what CSS approach you're using
[02:09:29] <newton> but with data attrs you avoid having to care about the approach at all
[02:09:49] <newton> though before I started using data attrs I would use classes such as js-xyz etc
[02:09:51] <ThePendulum> that seems like an abuse of that attribute though
[02:09:54] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@185.192.69.208)
[02:10:57] <newton> abuse?
[02:11:02] <tusko> How would I reference that then?
[02:11:15] <tusko> it says hist[0] is undefined
[02:11:35] <newton> you have to add data-history-list to the div that contains the acnhors
[02:12:04] <ThePendulum> so you just have double definitions everywhere?
[02:12:05] <onosendi> tusko: https://jsfiddle.net/5ympgv0a/
[02:12:14] <newton> ThePendulum, double?
[02:12:33] <ThePendulum> well yeah, a class for the CSS and then basically the same identifiers for JS
[02:12:58] <newton> the CSS can focus on being styling and removed from js consideration totally
[02:13:04] <newton> regardless if they have similar naming
[02:13:19] <onosendi> ThePendulum: if the CSS class isn't styling, then it shouldn't be there just for selecting. If it is styling, it's doing it's job as a style. Then you add the selector, data-*.
[02:14:22] <tusko> onosendi, yeah, no matter what when I run that in the browser it says hist[0] is undefined

[02:14:54] <tusko> hist is just an empty NodeList
[02:15:17] <ThePendulum> is your JS perhaps loaded before the DOM is?
[02:15:21] <ThePendulum> where's your script tag?
[02:15:40] <tusko> So, I've tried different things. Let me put something together for you.
[02:15:44] <ThePendulum> either add <script src="" defer> or put it at the bottom of the body
[02:16:26] <ThePendulum> onosendi: that seems very arbitrary, it's an identifier class, I would say it's much less specific to styling than data attributes are to actually containing some sort of data
[02:16:50] <newton> they don't have to contain data but have the added feature of being able to store data if you'd like

[02:17:16] <tusko> I even added sleep functions sleep(1000) But I suspect that yes that script needs to be delayed.
[02:17:26] <ThePendulum> if you use CSS classes semantically/descriptively then it will overlap, if you use it to describe styles then they won't collide, I don't see why you would ever have a problem using classes
[02:18:09] <tusko> ThePendulum, I don't have the ability to place it at the bottom of the page due to the nature of the script
[02:18:18] <ThePendulum> tusko: can you add the defer attribute?
[02:18:21] <tusko> its tacked onto a link
[02:18:28] <tusko> I have added the defer attribute, yes
[02:18:37] <onosendi> ThePendulum: Are you using the 'js-my-selector' approach, or are you selecting classes that are being used to style?
[02:18:46] <tusko> just <script defer>

[02:20:10] <ThePendulum> onosendi: I generally use .header etc., but even if I switched to using .light-bg I still don't see why I would have <class=".light-bg data-header> over <class=".header .light-bg"> and use identifiers as identifiers

[02:22:01] <newton> someone else looking at your html might not understand that .header is a js dependency
[02:22:11] <newton> seeing a data attribute might indicate otherwise imo
[02:22:24] <onosendi> ThePendulum: You'd have <div class="light-bg header" data-header>foo</div>, then select with data-header.
[02:22:42] <ThePendulum> onosendi: well I wouldn't have a header class then I assume
[02:23:33] <z1haze> i am having an issue with my build, with a particular package, pulling in its scss. My build keeps failing saying `SassError: File to import not found or unreadable: ~swiper/swiper.` however all of the other packages i am importing the styles the same way. Yes, i confirmed the file exists where I am fetching it from - my IDE even ctrl clicks right to the right. its just this one particular file it fails on. any ideas?
[02:23:46] <ThePendulum> newton: that is not something someone should assume if you didn't stop using classes as JS selectors in the first place though heh
[02:23:46] <tusko> Here you go ThePendulum its the whole thing https://jsfiddle.net/Lc96bnxp/3/

[02:25:13] <z1haze> I would assume I had something incorrectly configured, but all of my other libs pull in just fine
[02:25:15] <ThePendulum> tusko: that works as soon as you add <div id="history-list" class="list-group" data-history-list>
[02:26:08] <tusko> in the querySelectorAll?
[02:26:23] <ThePendulum> no in that div definition, in your fiddle you don't actually have that attribute added
[02:27:12] <ThePendulum> onosendi: admittedly I suppose I rarely natively select elements from my own DOM, I just don't remotely recognize what problem this would solve
[02:27:34] <tusko> ThePendulum, I have no control of how that html is defined
[02:27:45] <tusko> I can only reference it in my javascript
[02:27:55] <ThePendulum> tusko: right, then change your selector back to "#history-list > a"
[02:28:05] <tusko> ok
[02:28:09] <ThePendulum> data-history-list is only going to work if you can change both the html and the js

[05:50:12] <onosendi> It has something to do with `forwardRef` - I'm not getting that error when it's just a normal functional component.
[05:55:59] <Maxdamantus> Well, it's the variable that is constant ('lways storing the same reference value), not the object. `const` and `let` relate to variables, nothing else.

[07:57:36] <earendel> well. in fact how else would you enumerate props of objects inheriting enumerable props? you would need to manually walk up the prototype chain, assiging all keys to some final object.

[19:29:39] <Vooloo> I'm trying to figure out recursion but my function keeps resetting itself and emptying the array. How do I collect all the values recursively found before outputting it? https://hastebin.com/urejimatab.typescript
[19:32:04] <stenno> Vooloo: you don't do anything with the return value in line 11
[19:32:43] <Vooloo> It goes into errors.constraints
[19:33:14] <stenno> the return value will be an array with a single item, right?
[19:33:36] <stenno> allErrors only has a single item
[19:33:51] <stenno> of course it gets 'reset' each time you call the function, and this also counts for the recursing
[19:33:53] <Vooloo> Yes I need to add all the strings found into it and returning a string array
[19:33:58] <stenno> its a different variable
[19:34:28] <Vooloo> So i need a function inside the function?

[21:33:13] <ljharb> guideX: there are no types, so you don’t prefix with “Date” - it’s not Java
[21:33:46] <guideX> ah ok
[21:34:24] <guideX> I don't have any problem with that, until I come to a scenario like    var date; if(myDate != undefined && myDate != null) { date = ...; }
[21:34:28] <guideX> ljharb,
[21:34:45] <guideX> it seems like they never think I might want a variable declared before the scope of an if statement
[21:34:54] <guideX> which is needless to say, weird!
[21:35:00] <ljharb> guideX: that should be fine
[21:35:03] <ljharb> who is “they”
[21:35:17] <stenno> can maybe use ?? here
[21:35:18] <ljharb> to be clear, you don’t need to - var hoists to the top of the function.
[21:35:22] <guideX> they, the inventors of javascript, the gods of code and minions of syntax orthadoxy?
[21:35:29] <guideX> ah ok
[21:35:31] <ljharb> and yes, you can use ?? here

[21:35:55] <ljharb> guideX: it’s not good, but that’s a different topic
[21:36:05] <guideX> with date it threw me for a loop though, because I only know how to declare a date and create it at the same tim
[21:36:08] <guideX> e
[21:36:28] <guideX> in c#, I might do like DateTime blah = null; and then do my if
[21:36:41] <guideX> which is logical to me, but the way js does it is weird to me

[21:46:55] <joepie91> well
[21:47:02] <joepie91> a bit more precisely: you can't reassign the variable
[21:47:14] <joepie91> it is still entirely possible to change the value that the variable refers to, it doesn't make it immutable
[21:47:24] <joepie91> eg. if it points at an object you can modify that object

[22:14:58] <ezzieyguywuf> ah yes
[22:15:13] <ezzieyguywuf> so the bundler simply takes my many files and squishes them into one
[22:15:23] <ezzieyguywuf> and then I can probably make it minify too
