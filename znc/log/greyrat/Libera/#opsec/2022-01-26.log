[00:56:57] <jan6> 14:08 <Joanna> For the record I don’t trust people pushing the global warming narrative.
[00:57:05] <jan6> it's not even a narrative at this point
[00:57:30] <jan6> I can personally say that the winters are getting sloppier and warmer rapidly, during my lifetime
[00:57:52] <jan6> and seasons are not happening around the months they're supposed to, anymore
[00:57:54] <jan6> etc
[00:58:19] <jan6> also, there are plenty of measures taken, which usually just don't get put into news, or headlines
[00:58:44] <jan6> but yeah, a lot of 'em still don't act as if it was their future

[02:00:10] <Joanna> Population control usually involves keeping people from reproducing in various ways or of course killing them outright. One form of population control they have been  successful with for some people is changing the culture to be against marriage and children. Also make people have so many taxes that they feel that they are too poor to have kids as I’ve been told by people in Germany. The whole women should work outside home idea is 
[02:00:10] <Joanna> to discourage them from having children.

[02:14:53] <Joanna> jan6: I suspect global warming is a hoax because of the people pushing the idea and their stupid ideas of how to solve the “problem “ by taxing carbon and getting rid of meat.  I’ve also noticed that when I present practical ways to improve the environment such as not being so wasteful nobody likes the ideas at all and trolls start attacking me. I guess the global warming people don’t want anyone doing things that would 
[02:14:53] <Joanna> actually be good for the environment. I remember every nature show tries to mention how too many people are causing animal extinction but they never ever mention the large powerful companies behind environmental destruction do they?
[02:15:33] <jan6> stupid solutions don't mean the problem isn't a thing
[02:16:09] <jan6> just like people buying NFTs doesn't mean they're not a scam
[02:17:42] <jan6> also "not being wasteful" is ALSO a stupid idea and one of the most popular ones out there, anyway, well, not "stupid", just only has an effect if you get millions of people to be less wasteful (or hundreds of companies)
[02:18:00] <jan6> it's great in theory, it just doesn't have much of an effect
[02:19:33] <Joanna> I’ve repeatedly suggested getting rid of consumerism which is very wasteful and excessive energy usage for stupid things like cars and climate control and excessive internet traffic. I have yet to find anyone who wants this. If it were up to me I would take most street lanes away and replace with trolleys , bike lanes and trees that produce something edible.
[02:21:48] <Joanna> The powers that be are responsible for all the things being as they are. It’s not impossible to fix all it takes are some men with construction equipment. It would be beneficial and make good jobs doing something useful for once.
[02:22:26] <s1gyn> If companies would stop using platic packaging the oceans wouldn't be so full of trash islands
[02:22:53] <s1gyn> and there wouldn't be chemicals in food and water that are cancinogens and endocrine distrupters

[02:24:48] <jan6> that's jus dream talk, lol
[02:25:10] <Joanna> There is absolutely no excuse for disposable packaging besides the way they have decided that food can’t be produced locally. Food should come in reusable glass bottles and jars like it used to. The whole processed food industry to replace housewives cooking for their families is very bad in many ways.
[02:25:39] <jan6> just like "get rid of politicians" ain't gonna happen, neither is consumerism or capitalism, if it has any chance to not die
[02:26:13] <Joanna> jan6: it’s not dream talk. Do you want to solve environmental problems or not?
[02:26:25] <jan6> it is dream talk, if you look at the world

[02:27:17] <Joanna> Then if there is really global warming as you say we are all going to cook because everyone is complacent

[02:33:03] <Joanna> They are getting rid of abortions? I doubt that ..
[02:33:27] <Bitweasil> Planned Parenthood, Roe V Wade, the Supreme Court decision in the US that federalized/legalized generalized abortions.
[02:33:28] <s1gyn> roe vs wade being overturned will leave it to the states to decide
[02:33:32] <Bitweasil> ^^
[02:33:49] <Bitweasil> It would move it back to the states, and a lot of them will eliminate it as a general purpose option.
[02:34:54] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:37:10] <Joanna> If it weren’t a bad enough thing to use killing fetuses as a form of birth control. They have been selling the fetus parts to scientists to experiment with. In the old days making stuff with dead baby parts would have been called witchcraft. Now it’s called science:)
[02:37:43] <Joanna> I’m not against abortion in cases of rape of course.
[02:38:28] <Joanna> But that can be accomplished with a pill
[02:38:34] <jan6> it's generally cheaper to be preventative, anyway
[02:38:47] <Bitweasil> And in a rather short term after fertilization, yes.
[02:39:41] <Joanna> As I’ve said before people who aren’t in stable relationships that can support a child really shouldn’t be doing that to begin with.
[02:39:51] <Bitweasil> I'm pretty hardline anti-abortion, from the perspective of a fetus being, by default, a human until it's not.  That doesn't mean I've any interest in murder charges for miscarriage or nonsense like that, but the sentiment is swinging against the current way of things, and it will be interesting to see where it ends up.
[02:39:53] <jan6> it's usually not a choice, at the point of abortion, it's that it's too late for the SOS pill or such, and preventative measures either failed, or weren't deployed in time
[02:40:31] <Bitweasil> The question, though, is "Does that child deserve a shot at life?"  I absolutely think we need to improve the state of adoption and foster care (I know many people involved in both, and it's a red tape mess at all ends).
[02:40:50] <Bitweasil> And I've no problem with more freely available preventative measures.
[02:40:58] <jan6> it's better to kill an unborn fetus by choice than destroy your entire life by being forced to care for a kid you're not ready for
[02:40:59] <s1gyn> jan6: they can take resonsibilty and raise the child or give it up for adoption.
[02:41:12] <Bitweasil> But once it's a child, well... I would argue, strongly, that said child has a right to life.
[02:41:47] <s1gyn> It's better to kill your grandparents because taking care of them would be a burden and ruin your life <--- how is that different?
[02:41:59] <Joanna> The cause of so many abortions is the culture idea of casual sex being an entitlement which started with invention of birth control pill in 1960s
[02:42:02] <Bitweasil> s1gyn, I like that, may borrow it.
[02:42:03] <jan6> of course, life is better than no life, but also, we DO have a bit of overpopulation problem, overall ;P
[02:42:21] <s1gyn> jan6: we have a bit of a distribution problem
[02:42:29] <jan6> that, too, for sure
[02:42:34] <Bitweasil> Though most would argue, "Well, that's what social security/Medicare/etc are for."
[02:42:58] <Bitweasil> We have a resource use problem per capita, certainly.
[02:43:23] <Bitweasil> Reducing population helps a lot, but most models have the global population peaking now or fairly soon after now.
[02:43:59] <Bitweasil> But, if you're OK eliminating a fetus for overpopulation reasons, why not extend that to a 1 or 2 year old?
[02:44:05] <Bitweasil> (if you do, we disagree, but at least you're consistent)
[02:44:20] <jan6> they have a concious, so you "see" and "know" they're aware, and "alive"
[02:44:22] <Joanna> People who don’t want children shouldn’t have sex . If an unwanted child is conceived there is no good solution. So better that it not happen to begin with.
[02:44:52] <Bitweasil> Shouldn't have sex/should mechanically sterilize themselves, either way.
[02:45:07] <Bitweasil> (vasectomy/tubes tied/{etc})
[02:45:32] <jan6> y'know, certain plants have been proven to also have sort of primitive concious or such, but people usually view a squirrel and an eggplant in very different ways, and damaging plants are not much of an issue as compared to moving animals
[02:45:57] <Joanna> The best solution I can think of for an unwanted pregnancy is if someone who wants a child buy the child from the mother but that’s probably illegal.
[02:46:49] <Bitweasil> That's adoption.
[02:46:54] <jan6> there's a lot of things that require massive societal shifts to properly fix
[02:47:09] <jan6> adoption doesn't "buy", but basically same, sure
[02:47:51] <Bitweasil> It's a minor set of semantic shifts involved, but practically leads to the same result.  It's not a cheap process.
[02:48:13] <jan6> the difference is mainly that neither party gains money, but yeah
[02:48:20] <Joanna> Adoption is uncertain and I think the mother doesn’t get paid for the effort of creating the baby.
[02:48:38] <jan6> you could always just donate money or stuff in gratitude ;P
[02:49:11] <s1gyn> Bitweasil: i have not really looked into it deeply, who gets the money?
[02:49:24] <Bitweasil> There are adoption agencies involved in the process.
[02:49:46] <Bitweasil> And it's likely as not to involve state red tape and filing fees.
[02:50:00] <Joanna> I don’t think that women with unwanted pregnancies want to put all that effort into making a child they don’t want .
[02:50:22] <s1gyn> I believe it's cheaper if you foster then adopt assuming the kid doesn't end back up with their parents
[02:50:32] <Bitweasil> That's a common enough path too.
[02:50:50] <jan6> ^which is the main point for abortions, I'm pretty sure, Joanna
[02:51:55] <jan6> unwanted pregnacies can seriously affect life, especially if you're doing work where physical activity, or "good looks" are significant parts
[02:52:19] <s1gyn> In that cases the responsible thing would be to abstain from sex
[02:52:48] <s1gyn> you shouldn't get to kill people because you were irresponsible
[02:53:06] <Bitweasil> Or ensure multiple systems of protection stacked.
[02:53:15] <Bitweasil> It's not exactly news that condoms break, birth control fails, etc.
[02:53:16] <jan6> or do triple protection (e.g. condoms on both people, + extra measure)
[02:53:17] <jan6> yeah
[02:53:22] <s1gyn> right
[02:53:45] <s1gyn> but none of those are 100% so use those if it wouldn't be convient, but would be survivable to have a child
[02:53:54] <s1gyn> if it wouldn't be survivable
[02:53:57] <Joanna> The true cause of abortions that nobody wants to discuss is women being bullied into sex. In the old days there was no such thing as casual sex and women on dates had a relative there as a chaperone in most cases. The abortion industry is a direct result of the people who want there to be casual sex outside marriage. It’s all part of the agenda to destroy the institution of family.
[02:54:02] <s1gyn> keep reproductive organs 6 feet aparet
[02:54:04] <jan6> but also, they might be afraid to talk about rape, also, especially if they like the person, but just had an unwanted encounter
[02:54:28] <Bitweasil> I mean, even vasectomies sometimes reverse, though that falls, in my book, into the "Welp.  Guess we've got a kid now..." category of "unlikely, not impossible, but certainly improbable."
[02:54:48] <Bitweasil> Your life may be altered from your plans by having a child.
[02:55:07] <Bitweasil> But, as s1gyn points out, that doesn't mean that you should be able to kill someone because they're inconvenient.
[02:55:30] <Bitweasil> If your spouse gets cancer or something, that's damned inconvenient, but we don't generally smile on people killing off their spouse if they've become a nuisance to take care of.
[02:56:15] <Bitweasil> Joanna, casual sex outside marriage, and a rather steep decline in popularity of "shotgun weddings."
[02:56:24] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[02:56:32] <jan6> the line is drawn at "can we understand of them being concious"
[02:57:15] <Bitweasil> I don't think that's a reasonable line to draw, because it involves knowing the internal state of another, and we don't have the ability to reasonably do that.
[02:57:26] <Bitweasil> I'm also generally not comfortable with lines that change based on the state of medical technology.
[02:57:48] <Bitweasil> (heartbeat laws, or "viable outside the womb" or such are lines that change based on the technology in use and skill of the medical practitioners)
[02:58:10] <Bitweasil> And I don't think that "human or not" is a line that should be impacted by the state of technology.
[02:58:54] <jan6> you could draw it at the "shape" stage
[02:59:00] <Bitweasil> If you're in a coma and your heart has been bypassed by a mechanical pump for surgery, are you still human?
[02:59:18] <jan6> e.g. with a tail, isn't yet a "typical human"
[02:59:34] <Joanna> Everyone wants convenience and consumerism. In a sense you can think of having sex irresponsibility and then disposing of results as being sort of similar to all other modern behavior which creates garbage except this one involves killing what would have been your child!
[02:59:36] <Bitweasil> A newborn or a toddler looks rather unlike an adult, yet we consider them human.
[02:59:48] <jan6> not really unlike
[02:59:53] <Bitweasil> They start to look like "a small person" around 5 or so.
[03:01:27] <jan6> also, if everyone wants convenience, what is your plan to change that, Joanna? how do you think you'll get anyone to do more inconvent stuff, "for the greater good", when vast majority of people prioritize themselves over everyone else
[03:03:15] <Joanna> jan6: a lot people are too stupid to realize that children are their future and by not having children is same result as them never existing to begin with.
[03:03:26] <jan6> not the same at all
[03:03:34] <jan6> same only from genetic part
[03:03:56] <jan6> but people have much more of an effect than purely genetic offspring
[03:05:47] <Joanna> Also another thing I’d like to add is the problem is not over population is how people are organized and how they live. The way people live is very wasteful and inefficient. And with cars a lot of space is wasted on roads and parking lots that could be better used.
[03:06:20] <jan6> it's actually VERY efficient to live in cities, as compared to more spread out stuff
[03:06:45] <Joanna> jan6: if you your great great grandparents had decided not to have kids would there be any difference?
[03:06:51] <jan6> but cars are wasteful, and individual houses with entire gardens for each, is also sorta wasteful
[03:07:03] <jan6> EVERYTHING changes something
[03:07:29] <Joanna> Cities are not efficient unless they are very small and surrounded by farmland.
[03:07:45] <jan6> they are efficient
[03:07:53] <Joanna> High rises are very wasteful and energy consuming
[03:07:59] <jan6> depends how high
[03:08:07] <jan6> skyscrapers are ludicrous
[03:08:21] <Joanna> Anything to high to use stairs
[03:08:28] <jan6> like 80 stories or such, is quite acceptable
[03:08:35] <jan6> hundreds, is too much, I'd agree
[03:09:00] <Joanna> You want to walk up 80 flights of stairs everyday?
[03:09:09] <jan6> not *want*, but it's doable
[03:09:16] <jan6> also why every day?
[03:09:27] <Bitweasil> Most people have a job?
[03:09:31] <Bitweasil> That isn't in their living room?
[03:09:32] <jan6> you can spread it out, some days walk, some days not, some days walk halfway, sometimes full way
[03:10:05] <Joanna> I live in building that has stairs and elevator and very few people use the stairs.
[03:10:08] <jan6> most people's job isn't physical, these days, anyway, and most people won't be on the top, anyway
[03:10:10] <jan6> of course
[03:10:14] <jan6> convenience, remember
[03:10:38] <Joanna> jan6: good luck hiking 80 flights with groceries:)
[03:10:55] <jan6> as I said, why would you assume you need to walk full way, every day?
[03:11:51] <Joanna> Doesn’t matter it will be very inconvenient either way. The less you go out the heavier the groceries will be..
[03:12:06] <jan6> obviously ~80 is too high to be "good", but hey, I said "acceptable", not "good" ;P
[03:12:19] <jan6> most people will be on lower floor anyway ;P
[03:13:01] <Joanna> While I don’t dislike the idea of running up 80 flights of stairs I’d rather they be somewhere scenic like the mountains
[03:13:14] <jan6> the less convenient it is, the cheaper it'll be, anyway, most likely
[03:14:05] <jan6> also "scenic like mountains" has the same point of "what about groceries"
[03:14:06] <jan6> lol
[03:14:23] <Joanna> It’s untenable. Buildings shouldn’t be over 5 floors and even that could become annoying.
[03:14:39] <jan6> 5 floors is too low of a limit
[03:14:59] <jan6> not that many people need to run up and down their home many times
[03:15:01] <Joanna> For most people it’s too much
[03:15:13] <Joanna> Even 3 floors is too much
[03:15:22] <jan6> 3 floors is too wasteful
[03:15:40] <Joanna> It’s not wasteful it’s good
[03:15:45] <jan6> it is wasting space
[03:15:56] <jan6> which most places ALREADY don't really have too much of
[03:16:27] <Joanna> Take the space away from overly wide streets
[03:16:34] <jan6> you'd be literally AT LEAST quadruplicating close to every city
[03:16:47] <jan6> smaller roads don't help too much with that
[03:18:06] <jan6> if you want to limit everyone to max 5 floors, then that's also greatly raise transport costs
[03:18:09] <Joanna> Another thing about high rises is they make cities less safe because people living in them are oblivious to what is happening below.
[03:18:26] <jan6> how's that less safe
[03:18:39] <jan6> they're just as oblivious as if they were 2 blocks away
[03:18:46] <jan6> which would be the case if it was all small houses
[03:19:19] <jan6> or even more, if it's a high building
[03:19:39] <Joanna> There is a link to urban planning book in topic also you can look up why Pruitt igoe apartments were a disaster
[03:20:08] <jan6> there's a ton of ways to do any given thing
[03:20:41] <jan6> but limiting EVERYONE to low buildings, is an awful idea, because that means everyone has to walk a *LOT* more, plus ALSO transport a LOT further, for ANYTHING
[03:20:58] <Joanna> Town homes not over 3 stories tall are a good infrastructure
[03:22:00] <Joanna> I don’t see how it would make anything more difficult to build cities properly
[03:22:09] <jan6> you'd be multiplying the sizes of cities several times, which also means that either you need to add even MORE shops and other "things", or you need to take a huge trip every time you need to do something outside home
[03:22:38] <jan6> it's better to prefer lower houses, sure
[03:22:48] <Joanna> As I said reclaim a large portion of space wasted on cars
[03:22:51] <jan6> but you shouldn't limit at single digits
[03:23:04] <jan6> at least over here, that's very little
[03:23:13] <jan6> you won't reclaim it ANYWAY
[03:23:21] <jan6> because that space would just go to the new houses
[03:23:37] <Joanna> People need things to be within a quarter mile walk to be convenient
[03:24:09] <jan6> which means you not only multiply all houses, you also need to add more shops and stuff on top of it
[03:24:31] <jan6> before long, you'll have "cities" that sprawl across continents
[03:24:31] <Joanna> Do you have a name of place I can look at on google maps to see what you mean?
[03:24:32] <jan6> lol
[03:24:39] <jan6> mean what?
[03:25:02] <Joanna> Let me see your city
[03:25:33] <Joanna> Shops can be on first floor of buildings
[03:25:54] <Joanna> What city are you talking about?
[03:27:15] <jan6> https://goo.gl/maps/BEtbmBenqedGA2Te6
[03:27:27] <Joanna> I’ve seen cities with quite a lot of space wasted on parking lots and wide streets
[03:27:33] <jan6> you might as well call it town, I suppose, given how huge things are over there
[03:27:41] <jan6> in usa, it is indeed horrible
[03:28:06] <jan6> I've seen pictures of parking lots literally replacing houses which used to be there, lol
[03:28:21] <jan6> but that's only a thing at usa
[03:29:26] <jan6> other places aren't NEARLY as car-centric, like sure, people still use cars a lot, but not to the point of doing everything purely for cars, with cars
[03:29:41] <Joanna> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FbKtxLl5/1643155176.JPG
[03:30:07] <jan6> yeah, that's the old town, it's been that way since horse carriages
[03:30:08] <Joanna> Four stories tall
[03:30:16] <Joanna> I like that
[03:31:41] <jan6> most places here tend to be similar height, of ~2-4 stories high (other than the soviets big block buildings, of course, and after that, the modern block buildings, but most places are still more wide than high)
[03:32:38] <Joanna> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/cPmht0bs/1643155354.JPG
[03:33:08] <jan6> what's the point?
[03:33:10] <Joanna> It looks like they really don’t want cars driving through there
[03:33:26] <jan6> those are the dynamic ones you can lower, on the left side ;P
[03:33:39] <jan6> well, the ones with the circle sign stickers
[03:33:53] <jan6> at least probably are
[03:34:32] <Joanna> It looks like older buildings favor 4 floors
[03:34:48] <Joanna> New building is ugly
[03:34:57] <jan6> might not be, but also, I think that's one of the most surveilled areas anyway, probably, iirc it's where there's some embassy and other "serious stuff"
[03:40:06] <jan6> also for being the creator of #opsec, you still show your resolution and your device's taskbar, which if I was super snooper, could probably correlate the system fonts and icons of, to pin down the type of device, and then fish through either a redirect, or a normal page link, more details, up to the point of identifying exactly what device you use, and probably also where ;P
[03:40:44] <jan6> wouldn't be surprised if you used a samsung galaxy tab, for example
[03:40:56] <Joanna> Hmm
[03:41:39] <Joanna> Which link?
[03:42:12] <jan6> both your screenshots
[03:42:56] <jan6> and the identifying link could be anything, where I can see the backside of what request your device made, and hence the identifying parameters (even if user-agent is faked, there's plenty more)
[03:43:32] <Joanna> Ah I guess I should avoid screenshots
[03:44:02] <Joanna> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FbKtxLl5/1643155176.JPG
[03:44:11] <jan6> there's also some non-identifying exif data there, which could be correlated, the only parts a random online tool found, were the creation and modification dates, and colorspace, and sampling factor, which aren't really unique, but could narrow the device down potentially, if some of the options don't support those samplings or colorspaces
[03:44:19] <Joanna> How about that one?
[03:44:40] <jan6> they both have the same data
[03:44:53] <jan6> there's nothing personal there
[03:45:25] <jan6> I just find it amusing that for someone advocating for opsec, you don't even crop out the notification bar, even though it's empty
[03:45:37] <jan6> like I wouldn't know you were on a battery powered device, otherwise ;P
[03:46:02] <Joanna> https://goo.gl/maps/skDLfZk3VGD1uL8m9
[03:46:21] <Joanna> What about that one?
[03:46:48] <jan6> I do prefer pictures over something bloaty like google maps link, tho, but whatever
[03:46:57] <jan6> nice link of zoomed in to the asphalt to the max
[03:46:58] <jan6> lol
[03:47:23] <jan6> I didn't even know you could zoom in that much
[03:48:02] <Joanna> Move it around it’s a street view.
[03:48:13] <jan6> also, I know you're almost certainly using google maps app, not the webpage, based on the screenshots, too ;P
[03:48:25] <Joanna> That’s strange that it’s zoomed in
[03:48:31] <jan6> (maybe not, just a guess)
[03:48:46] <jan6> it was literally max zoom straight down
[03:48:47] <jan6> lol
[03:48:54] <jan6> licking the road
[03:48:57] <Joanna> I know
[03:49:11] <jan6> but yeah, come live over here ;P
[03:49:17] <Joanna> I didn’t do that though
[03:49:30] <jan6> less nonsense, and much more beautiful place to live in ;P
[03:49:36] <Joanna> You don’t have freeways there
[03:49:42] <jan6> why would we?
[03:50:15] <jan6> not inside towns and cities, at least
[03:51:36] <jan6> of course there are some that may or may not fit the description, for intra-city travel, often extending a bit into the city, around the busier areas
[03:52:13] <Joanna> You are lucky
[03:52:56] <Joanna> I see some car dependent suburbia forming though
[03:53:17] <jan6> https://goo.gl/maps/P9bjy9K4jeriAjRG7
[03:54:48] <Joanna> Looks a lot like America https://goo.gl/maps/CZKr8XvxEdK2MEMPA
[03:56:27] <jan6> of course that's near the airport AND a shopping centre ;P
[03:56:40] <Joanna> At least they didn’t put the bike lane next to the cars like they do in America
[03:56:41] <jan6> the ONLY airport in town, afaik
[03:58:06] <jan6> the "pikaajaline parkla" is "long-time parking" btw, if you were wondering
[03:58:25] <Joanna> I just noticed that there is a guard rail to keep cars off the sidewalk
[04:01:42] <Joanna> I don’t see much evidence of bike riding though
[04:08:38] <Joanna> The grocery store clerks sit ? That’s strange
[04:12:48] <jan6> not as strange as forcing people to stand up ~6-7 hours straight
[04:16:25] <Hydragyrum> as someone who stands for a 10hr shift, yeah
[04:16:29] <Hydragyrum> it's not fun
[04:17:45] <Joanna> I’ve never seen a store where checkers sat down before that I can remember
[04:18:05] <jan6> just one more of the wonders of capitalist 'murica
[04:18:16] <jan6> along with store prices not ACTUALLY reflecting what you have to pay
[04:19:03] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: I once tried to limit my computer gaming by standing up and the result was I was standing for probably 12 hours a day or more
[04:19:03] <jan6> like, wtf, if you're big enough to have stores in different tax regions, you should be big enough to afford someone, even a computer program, to automatically calculate the final price!
[04:19:39] <jan6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUoHPd-_N0
[04:20:31] <Joanna> They also do that with income. They say you are making x dollars per hour which of course you never get
[04:20:33] <jan6> microsoft wants to add their own chip inside cpu, to replace TPM, separate from the rest, which microsoft can push updates to, instead of the motherboard maker... totally not scary at all
[04:20:46] <jan6> oh income is just bruto vs neto
[04:21:33] <Joanna> In America they don’t tax food in a lot of places though
[04:21:55] <jan6> you make X amount, then the employer takes of Y taxes and other stuff, gives it to you, and then you pay your taxes and stuff
[04:22:57] <Joanna> So they should tell you what you will actually be paid then which is a lot less than claimed.
[04:24:23] <jan6> oh btw, do you have bottle recycling programs? I like that incentive, which basically means some cents free money for every returned bottle/can (which you pay when you buy the thing, just recycling it gives it back to you)
[04:26:43] <jan6> (only works for specifically marked ones, and often only within a single country, despite EU-wide universal labels, iirc, but like something like some drink might be 0.90+0.10 deposit, so you pay 1€, and then you can return the empty bottle to get 0.10 back, or be wasteful and throw it away, which potentially lets someone else to fish it out and return it)
[04:37:38] *** Joins: treble (~treble@user/treble)
[04:44:53] <Joanna> jan6: the us pretends to recycle but really doesn’t.  It’s kind of a joke they make people who want to recycle put in extra work to do so.they got rid of the reusable bottles that had big deposits a long time ago. I think they give some ridiculous small amount for cans and some bottles if you drive them in your car to a recycling center...
