[00:37:01] <dimadima> shapr: i like to think i've internalized those rules quite substantially just from life experience but a setting where those things are enumated like that is nothing short of terrifying, conceptually
[00:37:18] <dimadima> i'm not one of thse ppl who opposes CoCs or something
[00:38:14] <dimadima> but i'm sort of hobbsian in my outlook and my experience has been that people will find a way to be passive aggressive if that's their thing

[00:49:31] <cot> Sure, it's highly political, but it's still related to something that's discussed on the site.
[00:49:56] <dimadima> cot i thought #lobsters was pretty strictly about computation
[00:50:03] <shapr> dimadima: best thing about RC, it's not passive aggressive, no one is trying to win
[00:50:22] <cot> I don't know, to be honest, dimadima. My impression is that anything that's on-topic on the site is on-topic here.

[13:03:04] <iDrougge> The solution: Change the specification so the bug is no longer a bug.
[13:03:28] <rtpg> I mean... it's not the worst solution in the world, but it's definitely something where having a principled way to roll out breaking changes is nice
[13:04:09] <rtpg> Such a paradigm shift when you introduce versioning to some tool and suddenly you can, yknow, fix bugs in systems with legacy users
[13:05:01] <iDrougge> I was actually just looking for a way to find out what timezone Crashlytics (which Google bought several years ago and integrated into Firebase, for some unknown reason) uses. It says nowhere.
[13:05:31] <iDrougge> No way to change it either. Or change the time format so it doesn't use $BRAINDEAD.
[13:06:14] <iDrougge> Perhaps it says what timezone it uses in a documentation page somewhere, but is that to be trusted?

[17:44:25] <gwozniak> "Compiler takes too long" is the bug. Ought to be a blast.

[17:44:32] <cot> Sounds like a lot of machocistic fun
[17:44:44] <c355e3b> I think I managed to fix my test coverage issue at work
[17:44:49] <c355e3b> which took far too long
[17:45:44] <gwozniak> They use tcsh as their shell and wrote some large Perl program to do the job submission.  Gonna be a day...
[17:46:13] <cot> tcsh. Which OS's still ship that as the default?
[17:46:36] <gwozniak> This is CentOS 7, so I think they willingly chose this shell
[17:46:39] <c355e3b> FreeBsd IIRC
[17:46:52] <c355e3b> If you are on Centos, you have chosen nothing willingly
[17:46:58] <gwozniak> hahaha
[17:47:07] <cot> Does freebsd ship csh? I thought that was the default one when I used it
[17:47:13] <cot> s/Does/Doesn't/
[17:47:32] <gwozniak> I think the root account on FreeBSD used tcsh until at least recently

[23:16:42] <c355e3b> the problem is there isn't a lot of push to make them less bad because there isn't a drive for it in the industry
[23:16:47] <mouseghost> it depends on what kind of formal proofing imo
[23:16:50] <c355e3b> and there wont be till the tools are good etc
[23:17:03] <Helmholtz> To me, nothing in CS matters unless it is formally proven
[23:17:14] <mouseghost> for example i cant get my head around coq or things like that, but temporal logic and model checking are easy to understand conceptually
[23:17:23] <imode> you should probably split CS and programming because they are not the same.
[23:17:25] <Helmholtz> Like no protocol, language, etc seem revolutionazing for me

[23:21:36] <Helmholtz> Why do people bother with inventing new programming languges (Rust, Nim, zig) when they should really be spending time on formally proven methods
[23:21:56] <imode> I mean, Rust is an example of formal methods applied.
[23:22:01] <imode> the borrow checker respects linear logic.
[23:22:10] <cot> Eh, I want to write my trash quickly, not spend time formally proving my dirty scripts :P
[23:22:10] <Helmholtz> like one idea
[23:22:26] <imode> it's also strongly typed, so..
[23:22:41] <riv> you can do formal proofs today
[23:22:51] <imode> formal proofs need a backing logic. choose a backing logic, there are hundreds.
[23:22:54] <Helmholtz> It appears ADA in 90s had a better strong type story
[23:23:09] <imode> go write some haskell.
[23:23:12] <riv> you can formally verify your rust code
[23:24:58] <varjag> Helmholtz: in all engineering disciplines the existing formal methods are not used rigorously
[23:25:10] <varjag> electronics, construction, mechanical
[23:25:16] <varjag> most of the time people eyeball it
[23:25:32] <phil> Just having a model is a big step up.
[23:25:33] <varjag> software is no different
[23:25:34] <Helmholtz> Like consider bash scripting. Isn't there some elegance in `curl "url" | jq | etc`? My ideal programming language framework is like this. But with multi-pipes, and all things, formally proven
[23:26:08] <imode> formally verified forth.
[23:26:10] <riv> you have to write a specification in order to prove that your code satisfies a specification
[23:27:02] <riv> you can't just "prove" a bit of code on its own, you need to prove that it is or does a specified thing
[23:27:10] <Helmholtz> imode, forth led me to Red rabbit hole
[23:27:29] <Helmholtz> That lang seem alien
[23:27:48] <imode> very alien.
[23:29:40] <ngoldbaum> why is it so bad to improve on the status quo but not solve all correctness problems ever
[23:30:03] <ngoldbaum> it’s on the formal methods people to make it feasible to build nontrivial things and prove they’re correct
[23:30:36] <imode> imo with formal proofs you're just adding spec description to a program description. so you write a spec. and if it's not correct..
[23:30:55] <Helmholtz> If I were a billioner, I'd have heavily fund formal proof methods
