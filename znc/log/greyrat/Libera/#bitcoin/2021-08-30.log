[16:21:02] <cluelessperson> realcoiner, I suggest not watching videos of fortune tellers claiming they can see the future.
[16:21:34] <realcoiner> cluelessperson: I have essentially stopped, but then there's just... total silence and a low price.
[16:21:37] <Alver> The only real money involved in those videos is the ad revenue of the creator. :°)
[16:21:55] <realcoiner> I know the MMCrypto guy is a total scammer and bullshitting every single video, but I *want* to believe him...
[16:22:10] <realcoiner> Yeah... It's all about their stupid garbage "referral links".
[16:22:38] <cluelessperson> realcoiner, realistically, mainstream is still getting used to the idea of digital currency, and bitcoin has a way to go to develop maturity so that it's approachable by people in the mainstream.
[16:22:43] <realcoiner> And now he's started talking about a bunch of shitcoins too. I can't stand hearing about those.
[16:23:11] <Alver> (also, "low price" being... 4 times higher than last year?)
[16:23:47] <cluelessperson> realcoiner, You'll find that most/many altcoins are basically just overengineering or throwing too much shit ideas trying to claim they're somehow special or better, but really what we need is a simple, solid, reliable base currency.
[16:24:03] <cluelessperson> Bitcoin and perhaps several others seem to be developed in that direction.
[16:24:08] <realcoiner> A few days ago, I was extremely sick from eating spicy food. Compared to then, I felt wonderful the next day. But it's only relative. Soon, all my problems came back to the front of my mind. Same with the Bitcoin price.
[16:24:15] <cluelessperson> but development takes time, effort.
[16:24:41] <realcoiner> cluelessperson: I know. It's 100% scams and their only objective is to obtain more Bitcoin.
[16:24:49] <cluelessperson> realcoiner, Honestly that sounds to me like transference.
[16:25:01] <cluelessperson> realcoiner, eh,  90% scams.
[16:25:13] <cluelessperson> maybe higher.
[16:25:17] <realcoiner> Don't tell me you think that Ethereum isn't a scam...

[16:41:24] <Keele> in my view, it's not imortant that bitcoin goes up in price (more than is needed to secure the network), but that the western world moves away from the evil quasi-keynesian system to the bitcoin standard.
[16:43:32] <cluelessperson> Keele, that can't happen until maturity develops.

[17:01:17] <cluelessperson> Keele, a friend of mine in Texas, coworker at the time, was a veteran that spent two tours in Iraq.   Showed me a youtube video of some random marine that was playing with rebar  / steel he found on the side of a road.    He slapped the 1 inch thick steel on his knee, and it snapped.    He thought it a funny trick.
[17:02:34] <cluelessperson> At that moment, I realized that this entire country, and possibly region, lacked the education, technology, infrastructure, foundries, industry, to even build up what we demand as a developed country.       They could not possibly build up these things.  Not in our lifetimes.
[17:04:12] <cluelessperson> in the US, quality steel, concrete, glass, plastics are cheap, easy to source, transport.    Engineers are plenty (and we need more)

[21:51:28] <str1ngs> hello, I'm looking for more specifics on how to use the getblocktemplate RPC method. https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/mining.html does a good job of a general overview. But it does not explain what exactly you need to hash to create the merkle tree from transactions. I had thought I'd just use libblktemplate. But that appears to be outdated now. Since the testinput.c json example response. Does not reflect the response bitcoind
[21:51:29] <str1ngs> gives today. Any help with more up to date references would be appreciated.

[22:13:32] <str1ngs> I will look at that again, maybe I over looked something.
[22:15:56] <str1ngs> I found that was out dated too. For example getblocktemplate requests now require a rules param with segwit.

[23:22:41] <cluelessperson> earnestly, and most antivirus programs are scams, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were releasing exploits themselves.
[23:22:58] <earnestly> It did get that way
[23:23:21] <cluelessperson> earnestly, I've chat online with gaming server anti-hack software developers that straight up played both sides.
[23:24:20] <earnestly> binary packers tend to have the same stories
[23:28:08] <cluelessperson> paairs, Vaccines absolutely are highly effective.   There's a lot of statistical evidence to back that.   I have plenty of personal anecdotes friends on "both sides" in Texas who've been hospitalized,  and I have several friends that are experts (PhDs) in related fields of Genetic Storage, Biostatistics, and Viral Phylogenetics.

[23:31:17] <cluelessperson> paairs, Masks are also highly effective.  I started looking at how filtration is measured and rated when I was teargassed, and pepper sprayed numerous times last year in Seattle's protests.   Then even further at the curiosity in a another friend's research.  And then further when the California wild fire smoke covered Seattle.   I'm also planning on testing masks that I buy and pass out to strangers at meetups.   There have been several
[23:31:17] <cluelessperson> events here where I've already been passing them out.
[23:31:27] <cluelessperson> and, even a cotton t-shirt helps.

[23:48:48] <Diablo-D3> has severe reaction to wildfire smoke
[23:49:24] <Diablo-D3> upside is, they already had a ton of n95 masks and knew how to properly fit them
[23:52:00] <cluelessperson> Diablo-D3, I purchased a HEPA filter for my apartment and kept the windows shut all week.   The air felt disgusting outside and my new full mask's cotton got darker.
[23:53:21] <cluelessperson> btw, according to the ratings I've found,  an n95 mask, which are rated 0.1-0.3um, literally are capable of filtering literal viral cells out of the air (0.1um)
[23:53:59] <cluelessperson> but in actuality, I think what you care about is capturing water droplets, which are much larger,   because organic matter exposed to oxygen dies, immediately.
[23:55:05] <Diablo-D3> cluelessperson: basically
[23:55:09] <Diablo-D3> you're in the right ballpark with that
[23:55:15] <Diablo-D3> n95 masks are overkill for it
[23:56:13] <Diablo-D3> its why kn95 exists as a standard... the koreans made a variant of the n95 standard that preserves the biological filtering properties and cutting the cost massively, thus allowing most of korea just to wear masks outside all the time
