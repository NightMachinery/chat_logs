[00:38:00] <caveman> noted.
[00:38:27] <caveman> but it's good to try.  it's fun.  the real game is this, imo.  much more fun than playstation, xbox, etc.

[00:38:53] <caveman> even though the goal is to find a solution, but --imo-- the fun is in daring to try the challenge :D.
[00:39:15] <caveman> the challenge is the part where ``fun'' hormones jump all over the place.

[05:48:19] <tusko> Suppose we had a machine that we turn on and it runs an AES implementation in CTR mode. It is importnat for IVs not to repeat, so then would the machine need to keep the state of an internal counter while it is powered off, before starting up again since repeated IVs on the same plaintext would produce a repeated cyphertext and violate Kirchoff's butthole ?

[06:12:22] <tusko> lol, search engines produce miles of links about f'ing cryptocurrency miners lol
[06:12:33] <Alipha> tusko: there have been cases where devices have produced the same public/private keys as other devices because they generated them immediately after startup and there wasn't enough entropy, so yes, that is a concern
[06:13:14] <tusko> Ah, ok. I'm glad you said that. I had a feeling that might be an issue - startup is too similar.
[06:13:49] <Alipha> tusko: contemporary OSes will store the RNG state when they shut down, so that when they boot up again, they can use that state to ensure enough entropy
[06:14:00] *** Joins: SlimmyJimmy (blank@user/slimmyjimmy)
[06:15:29] <Alipha> I think storing the RNG state is a safer solution (especially if you periodically store it in the event of an unexpected power off) than storing the latest IV because, again, if there's an unexpected power off and the IV doesn't get saved, you're going to end up reusing IVs
[06:16:27] <Alipha> Whereas with the RNG, hopefully there would still be enough unique noise during start up in order to combine with the existing RNG state to not produce the same series of randomness
[06:17:52] *** Joins: PJBoy (~PJBoy@user/pjboy)
[06:18:43] <Alipha> ... actually I'm sure the OS doesn't store the exact RNG state, but instead like hashes it and stores the hash, so that the RNG state would indeed be different upon boot up

[14:11:04] <Sofia> Alipha: I don't know about Linux et al, but I do know that OpenBSD implements its cross-boot RNG by plucking a random value at boot, then also at shutdown. This means if the machine is hard-shutdown after boot (couldn't save the RNG update on shutdown) then it would still land in a unique state. Even if the hardware RNG et al entropy sources are deterministic, unavailable, or public.
[14:11:39] <Sofia> I think on the Linux side there is a systemd module or something? I don't have systemd so cannot verify that. 
[14:13:35] <Sofia> The biggest problem is just bootstrapping a secure RNG. I'm in favor of the machine which downloads the image, running a command to inject a fresh bit of randomness into a dedicated segment in the image. To then bootstrap the install. When installing, if the medium is read-write the installer could bump the stored RNG for successive installs. 
[14:13:43] <Sofia> Don't know anyone who does this. :(

[14:16:50] <snappy> interesting idea, but i feel this is mostly solved on desktop/server OSes by just using rdrand to collect entropy to bootstrap the rng, and then save state and reload at boot which seems to be a thing on most OSes
[14:18:05] <snappy> not sure what you mean by hard shutdown, but I recall at least FreeBSD saving a random seed every 5 minutes or so and when a reboot/shutdown event is triggered
[14:25:16] <Sofia> hard shutdown = power fault = no chance for the OS/kernel to do anything
[14:29:41] <yawkat> Sofia: but it's fine if there was fresh randomness written 5mins ago
[14:32:51] <Sofia> I don't like the idea of recurring writes. But yes, if you get that 5 minute fresh randomness then great.

[14:45:23] <Sofia> snappy: Notably not all hardware has rdrand or equivalent. Relatively new RISC-V cores get the Zkr extension which adds a CSR which contains random values (and a little more to that extension). A nice detail of this is that the kernel *can* allow userland to access it directly. For better or worse, every OS is probably going to keep that via the kernel. *shrugs*

[14:50:06] <Sofia> Software should also be better designed for handling its entropy. Don't ask the kernel every time you need some entropy. If a virtual machine is snapshotted and restored, either all interactions involving entropy must be deterministic or must diverge safely. Ex. Don't use the same nonce to sign different messages. 
[14:51:31] <Peng> "Don't ask the kernel every time you need some entropy." I disagree. The kernel should work well enough that almost no one should need to implement their own.

[14:57:12] <Sofia> Pretty sure even libsodium brings its own thread RNG seeded initially by the OS.
[14:59:07] <snappy> yeah i'm team kernel when it comes to getting entropy/randomness
[14:59:12] <Sofia> I'd rather promote pure code which doesn't need any syscalls. Yes, it might be a great idea to initialize with a safe RNG source. In some cases maybe even introduce new fresh randomness.
[15:01:59] <Sofia> Syscalls are slow. If you don't need much entropy then sure. Either way, I really find it disappointing and concerning how much code breaks when you snapshot a virtual machine, let it continue, then restore a backup. 
[15:02:30] <Sofia> breaks/leaks secrets / catastrophic failure with such a trivial use case.
[15:04:07] <Sofia> This by itself basically requires the software to maintain an RNG seeded by the OS/hardware and the transcripts of its protocols, such that convergent protocols produce the same results, and divergent protocols do not lead to nonce-reuse et al catastrophic failures.

[15:07:48] <Sofia> If your crypto library only asks the kernel for a fresh nonce after you've chosen the message, then you might be fine. But if the interface permits streaming, then you are likely to select a nonce then decide the message.
