[01:21:28] <vdamewood> Is there any reason you can't use a bitwise-and operation?
[01:21:34] <nomagno> austincheney: bit masking. You take the byte and a custom-crafted byte where only the bytes you want to keep are set (E.G. 0001000) and do a binary and. This way, if the bit is set it will NOT be 0 (1111111 & 00010000 = 00010000)
[01:22:06] <austincheney> vdamewood, JavaScript has excellent bitwise operators and I am bitwise ignorant.  I guess that would be the way to do this.

[02:22:59] <apotheon> Extraverts, in particular, seem *totally oblivious* to what it's like to be an introvert, to the point that they often come to wildly ludicrous conclusions about what it means to be an introvert.

[02:24:27] <InPhase> lantech19446: Introverted vs extraverted is fundamentally about preferred stimulation levels at which a person can sustain comfort and energy levels.  While extraverts seek out noisier passtimes often involving more time spent with other people, social skills exist across both groups.
[02:24:33] <apotheon> mrig: That's because of the Secret Language of Extroverts, who understand each other and agree with each other about their misunderstandings of introverts.

[02:25:52] <lantech19446> InPhase: I never said they don't exist across both groups, but former generations of IT workers had very low social skills and had difficulty interfacing with other people so IT has been seeking out progressively more extroverted people than they used too

Part of that is because of hearing problems aggravated by noise but a large part of it is being uncomfortable in groups to begin with. I also spend quite a bit of quiet time though my hobby involves talking to people all over the world

[02:47:02] <apotheon> yeah, lantech19446 too
[02:47:23] <apotheon> If I ever decide to have kids, I'll probably either adopt them or build and program them myself.
[02:47:48] <jkk> without experiencing feelings how can one relate to fellow people feelings 
[02:47:55] <InPhase> jkk: ln(Phase) believes that empathy is an awareness and/or concern for the feelings of others, with the meaning depending a bit on context.
[02:48:11] <lantech19446> we're decided not to have children right now because we can't afford them but we're scared to have any blood children between my mental illness and her type 1 diabetes and fibromyalgia so we'll probably adopt when we're better off financially
[02:48:14] <apotheon> Yeah, empathy has little to do with one's own feelings.
[02:48:38] <apotheon> lantech19446: good idea
[02:48:43] <apotheon> too many kids need adoption
[02:49:08] <apotheon> I hear that kids that have grown up a bit are less likely to get adopted, while babies often get snatched up right away.
[02:49:11] <jkk> inPhase ok lets drop empathy. we experience thoughts and feelings. intraverts experience them and so extraverts right? lol
[02:49:32] <InPhase> jkk: I'm not sure that sentence said what you wanted it to say.
[02:49:32] <lantech19446> I'm adopted and the only thing I know is my birth mother and my half sister both have tremendous mental health issues too I don't want my child to have to deal with that shit so adoption has always been on the table
[02:50:15] <apotheon> I seem to have pretty good genes, judging by most of my family.
[02:50:20] <jkk> inPhase introverts do not want to be emotional as their character perceives it as a potential danger
[02:50:33] <jkk> unless they know person well
[02:50:33] <InPhase> jkk: That part is just nonsense.
[02:50:35] <apotheon> Dad went off the rails a bit on health, though.  That's probably his own fault.
[02:50:47] <jkk> InPhase how come
[02:50:56] <InPhase> jkk: Because it has nothing to do with the roots of introversion.
[02:51:01] <jkk> why
[02:51:04] <lantech19446> several of mine are my own fault but i can't help the bipolar / depression issues
[02:51:07] <jkk> seems it is a root
[02:51:13] <jkk> or the root?
[02:51:18] <apotheon> It's not.
[02:51:22] <jkk> or
[02:51:26] <InPhase> jkk: Because of what I said above, introversion versus extraversion is about preferred stimulation levels for optimal sustained function and mental energy levels.
[02:51:51] <lantech19446> I think we've established that I'm not really extroverted so let me be the first to deny ever feeling like my emotions were dangerous to me

[02:52:10] <apotheon> lantech19446: same here, except second, I guess
[02:52:10] <InPhase> jkk: Or phrased in even more plain language, introverts get energized when things are quiet and worn out when things are noisy, extraverts feel drained when things are quiet and get energized by noise.

[05:04:06] <lantech19446> the part that has really burned me out on networking is that it has been so hard for me to learn anything for the last 30yrs of my life and now all of a sudden I can but when I look at how much I'd have to learn to get an entry level job in a larger network where I wouldn't make any more than I am now and I'd have worse health insurance it's overwhelming, aggravating, saddening, and I just
[05:04:07] <lantech19446> don't see being able to dig out of that hole.

That would potentially work as a pay increase, but would come with new learning opportunities as the systems are larger.  And it is probably just the sort of environment that would credit your existing experience.
[05:11:02] <Raziel> you also have to weight the advantages and disadvantages and decide. if switching domains and starting to learn new things is good for your soul, then maybe the slight initial downgrade in health insurance is a worthy sacrifice :p

You might not opt for the whole thing, but just progressing along with some courses might assist your learning and make you more appetizing to employers.  When I taught at Cabrini I had a lot of students pick up credits at MCCC, and they typically transfered just fine.  Usually with a place like that you can take courses at a

[06:43:48] <vdamewood> I should probably add quotes to these.
[06:43:58] <unetudiantJS> yea but no one in there said anything about a icmp type 7 and a number of them seem to say it's from legacy implementations
[06:44:15] <unetudiantJS> you don't need quotes, I know what you're citing
[06:44:59] <vdamewood> What exactly is the firewall rule? ICMP has no ports and is neither TCP nor UDP. ICMP is IP protocol 1 (see RFC792), TCP is IP protocol 6 (described in RFC793) and UDP is IP protocol 17(see RFC768). UDP and TCP have ports, ICMP has no ports, but types and codes.

[06:48:38] <unetudiantJS> ok here's why in rhel you can still allow icmp in the firewall i'm assuming
[06:48:41] <unetudiantJS> Is Port 7 Used For Ping ICMP?
[06:48:42] <unetudiantJS> The short answer is no. In the old days of the computer, there were a lot of simple protocols to help users in different cases. The TCP and UDP protocol number 7 is assigned for a simple ping service port where both TCP and UDP protocol can be used to make ping tests. This service is called an echo test where after connecting to the TCP and UDP port 7 the transmitted data is returned as a
[06:48:44] <unetudiantJS> response which creates an echo effect. But currently, most of the computers do not provide and serves this TCP and UDP port number 7 for this type of ping and connectivity check. As a general answer, the ICMP protocol does not use port number 7 which is a TCP and UDP service called echo that is absolute.
[06:48:55] <Decker> ua there's also echo udp
[06:49:02] <Decker> which is icmp echo is ping
[06:49:35] <Decker> right :) fun with low layers

[09:23:54] <apotheon> Green on black back in the good ol' days of monochrome monitors was the result of studies on a good balance of usability and reducing eye strain for text UIs.

[09:23:58] <sillymob[m]> but it's never really quite as fast as native
[09:24:13] <deniska> not even speed is the issue, but rather a mental overhead involved

[09:26:43] <apotheon> I don't recall whether red or white was supposed to be better for readability, but red became standard for military field use because it became difficult to discern more quickly as one moved away from it, thus making it more tactically sound to use in the dark.

[09:28:23] <pulse> InPhase, It's a pretty good representation of a first time Linux user though ;)
[09:28:26] <moose> So why not use amber for the highest level of visible warning?
[09:28:36] <moose> Red typically is used all over the world for the highest danger
[09:28:51] <moose> Maybe just a product of popularity?
[09:28:52] <apotheon> Identifying the specific color is harder with amber than with red, I think, but the fact a light is shining is more readily recognizable with amber.
[09:29:02] <moose> Ah, that may make sense.
[09:29:10] <moose> So it's easier to say "That's red, red is bad" but harder to detect a red beacon at distance.
[09:29:30] <apotheon> When red gets used for good reasons, it's probably just because it's a more distinctly discernible color.

[09:31:49] <apotheon> moose: harder to immediately distinguish it from white, probably
[09:32:00] <apotheon> also, yellow/amber is used for turn signals
[09:32:10] <pulse> Someone should invent a black light
[09:32:13] <moose> Red is more common in the US now for turn indicators

[09:33:09] <moose> apotheon: I suppose!
[09:33:37] <apotheon> Also, motorcycles typically use separate turn signals on the back, too, so they're generally amber.
[09:34:00] <apotheon> Some motorcycles get fancy (usually with aftermarket mods) with tail/turn lights, though.
[09:35:15] <JanC> re-using brake lights for turn signalling is illegal in Europe fortunately
[09:35:38] <sillymob[m]> it's kind of odd how a lot of the terminal colors are green, black, white, all the "base colors"
[09:35:39] <JanC> or re-using any other lights for them really
[09:35:46] <sillymob[m]> but we don't say "i have an orange terminal", it's always "amber"
[09:36:33] <apotheon> I've seen orange, and it's not the same as amber.
[09:36:40] <JanC> that's because amber monochrome monitors used a type of phosphor that was sold as "amber"

[10:22:47] <InPhase> pulse: I read a bunch more comments.  I suppose the most disappointing thing is that the vast majority of people commenting seem to think that "read what is on the screen" is a skill only present in top tier technical people, and should not be expected for mid-level technical experience.  I'm not really sure how so many people came to the conclusion that reading what is put in front of your face as 
[10:22:53] <InPhase> a warning is a super advanced skill.
[10:23:26] <pulse> InPhase, When you learn UX the first thing they tell you is, users never read what's on screen
[10:23:50] <pulse> So when a message box pops up and the only option is "OK", 99% of users will click OK without first reading what it's about
[10:24:03] <pulse> If the options are "Retry" and "Cancel" they will click Retry without reading what the message says
[10:24:07] <pulse> So that's not too far off imo
[10:24:23] <InPhase> pulse: But it is also absolutely ridiculous for people to do that.
[10:24:31] <pulse> Well, yeah
[10:24:52] <pulse> Although. You could argue it's ridiculous to install software without reading through the EULA, but literally all of us do that too
[10:25:10] <pulse> But that's a lot of time investment so it's slightly more reasonable than not reading the message box text
[10:25:39] <InPhase> I read them, and sometimes refuse to use things based on what they say.
[10:26:05] <pulse> I don't think I've ever read a single EULA. When the Windows installer doesn't let you through until you scroll down the EULA, I just scroll down and immediately press the button, lol

[12:44:15] <quazimodo> small file good
[12:44:19] <quazimodo> i forgot that
[12:44:27] <quazimodo> big churny file is a bad file in many ways
[12:44:34] <pyzozord> oh I thought it stored deltas
[12:44:35] <merijn> one of these days, hopefully, we'll all move on from git to patch based version control
[12:44:46] <quazimodo> what's with all the damn open source projects that have heeeuggggge files
[12:44:53] <quazimodo> and like 6 layer nested ifs
[12:44:54] <pyzozord> what's "patch based version control" in a nut shell?
[12:44:56] <quazimodo> how is that permitted
[12:45:10] <mrig> deniska more out of historical curiosity than anything else.
[12:45:14] <deniska> merijn: git is the only one I realistically worked with, also meaning to try fossil, but it's similar to git in this regard, it snapshots whole files
[12:45:31] <quazimodo> doesn't even seem to matter really though
[12:45:36] <quazimodo> a couple mb here & there for more speed, i like it
[12:45:43] <mrig> seems to resemble a piece table, just saving the diffs.
[12:45:45] <merijn> deniska: You should look at pijul (and more importantly, the theory behind it)
[12:46:17] <deniska> mrig: well, git supports patch based workflows because that's how linux kernel is developed, by sending emails with patches around :)
[12:46:37] <merijn> pyzozord: The idea is that you define a mathematical "patch" abstraction (something that transforms file set A into file set B) and patches have some nice algebraic properties
[12:46:48] <quazimodo> pijul looks cool i should read it

[12:47:02] <merijn> pyzozord: Specifically, non-conflicting patch application is associative (i.e. can apply them in any order and get the same result)
[12:47:27] <pyzozord> associative or commutative?
[12:47:46] <merijn> The problem with git (and all the other similar DAG based version control like fossil, mercurial, etc.) is that they enforce a "single" ordering that makes no sense
[12:47:49] <merijn> pyzozord: both
[12:48:11] *** Joins: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor)
[12:48:17] <quazimodo> merijn: what do we lose by enforcing ordering
[12:48:30] <merijn> If you think of "patches" then it doesn't matter that commit A "comes before" commit B, unless B changes code introduced by A
[12:48:48] <pyzozord> i thought enforced ordering was good because it was a history / log of changes
[12:49:13] <merijn> quazimodo: Ever make 6 independent bug fixes that you want to PR to the original repo and now you gotta either open PRs one at a time OR rebase all six onto master OR do a single PR with all 6 at once?
[12:49:30] <pyzozord> yeah that is annoying true
[12:49:33] <quazimodo> Nope we don't do PRs any more
[12:49:41] <merijn> quazimodo: Since patches have no order you can PR individual commits to the parent without doing that kinda stuff
[12:50:06] <deniska> sounds like a non-issue, just don't introduce 6 independent bugs at the same time into the same codebase
[12:50:11] <quazimodo> right, you can do 6 commits in a row on your side but submit 6 separate different PRs 
[12:50:11] <merijn> Patches still have *some* order, in that a patch depends on "all the patches that introduced the code they change"
[12:50:34] <merijn> There's actually a more painful thing they solve that's common with long running branches
[12:50:36] <quazimodo> which is better than trying to cherry pick those 6 'in series' commits
[12:50:46] <quazimodo> but the PR system is a bastard anyway
[12:50:54] <quazimodo> i don't love it
[12:51:13] <quazimodo> then again i don't do open source development 
[12:51:40] <mawk> we use PRs in our closed-source development

[12:52:44] <pyzozord> you spend weeks, then present your hard work, and people criticize it, or outright reject it
[12:52:55] <quazimodo> pyzozord: i'll be honest i'm not 100% sure how FOSS needs to work without PR being a way to organise contributions
[12:53:23] <quazimodo> pyzozord: that's also a cultural & professional practice thing
[12:53:41] <quazimodo> running off & developing something for weeks without integrating it more frequently is bad business no matter how you look at it
[12:53:48] <pyzozord> at work it's difficult too
[12:54:16] <pyzozord> my solution is to try to make PRs daily, but that requires other devs to review daily, which they often don't want to do

[12:57:53] <quazimodo> WHY
[12:57:56] <quazimodo> why you hurt me like this
[12:58:31] <merijn> In patch based systems, the conflict between two patches is explicitly stored in the metadata. And the conflict resolution patch is also stored, so patch based systems *know* that conflicts have been resolved already and not make you do them again
[12:58:50] <merijn> quazimodo: Because sometimes developing a feature can take 6 months, a year, or more?
[12:59:00] <quazimodo> that's crazy talk
[12:59:22] <quazimodo> but i can understand the value of a smarter resolution system
[12:59:25] <merijn> And the only reason people dislike long-lived branches is that git and DAG based version control make them a pain to deal with
[12:59:31] <quazimodo> no that's not true
[12:59:40] <pyzozord> git has some very superficial support for that, it automatically generates commit message for merge commits
[12:59:40] <quazimodo> long lived branches are a disaster for the business as a whole

[15:26:07] <zero> what i'm asking, however, is hiw do we call the specific instance of that when we let a definition use its own identifier to refer to previous state. that link defines shadowing as a variable overloading some outer scope. i'm not sure that's what i'm looking for
[15:26:56] *** Joins: blahblah441 (~blahblah4@89.46.62.154)
[15:27:12] <jwillia3> zero, as I said, it's not called anything if you are *updating* a value based on its previous value. If you are trying to *define* a variable based on its previous value, most languages will not let you do that.

[16:58:01] <marduk> Velkorq: I worked as a "web developer" a couple of jobs back. There's about 3 different groups. One group does all the mockups/design.. they probably don't consider themselve web designers though. Then there's a "front-end" group who mostly work with node, react, stuff like that. They build "components" and then there's the group that I worked in
[16:58:01] <marduk> that mostly worked on backend stuff, some front and (using the afore-mentioned components). I think all but the first I would consider programmers but even the first group didn't consider themselves programmers.
[16:58:02] <Velkorq> i mean pure javascript isn't used that much. they use things like angular and react as frameworks
[16:58:15] <Velkorq> is this considered programming? its not in the usual sense

[17:00:40] <sjmulder> if you write code you're a programmer.. even when it's not the main thing you do

[17:01:44] <marduk> I mean the labels didn't matter. But all three groups were necessary. Coz I don't like doing the component stuff. The component people aren't necessarily good at design and the design people aren't necessarily good at coding.

I'm sure all/most of them know a bit of JavaScript/HTML but they don't spend the majority of their time coding.  We never called them developers. We called them "the design team"

[17:05:16] <marduk> Ultimately if they want to call themselves developers I don't care. Heck, programmers have been calling themselves "engineers" for years and I don't consider (most of) them engineers. In the end it's just a label. Most of us know what we're talking about.

[18:09:04] <corn266> wait how are you using the term static
[18:09:29] <Bombe> The way the JLS uses it.
[18:10:00] <[itchyjunk]> I definately don't know hwat static array mean and which language does or doesn't have :D
[18:10:11] <[itchyjunk]> but yeah, not using non existant .get will solve this issue
[18:10:18] <corn266> cause if i instantiate a variable by: Type[] var_name = new Type[<some_int>]; then i have var_name which represents an array of some length and type
[18:10:41] <Bombe> corn266, sure but nothing about that is static.
[18:10:47] <[itchyjunk]> so far so good, that's how i declare it too
[18:10:57] <corn266> i can't change the length, so it's static
[18:11:05] <Bombe> That’s not what “static” means in Java.
[18:11:07] <[itchyjunk]> that's the only type of array in java
[18:11:19] <[itchyjunk]> you need List to have things that changes size

[18:12:20] <[itchyjunk]> though i don't know why or how

[18:19:02] <InPhase> jkk: To your earlier comment, I of course do use almost exclusively open source software, where the licenses are much better.  But notably, open source licenses are not EULAs.  They impact distribution, and do not restrict usage, and thus do not actually require any assertion of agreement.  Usage falls under existing rights for a legally obtained copy where obtaining a legal copy is a matter of 
[18:19:08] <InPhase> distribution rights.
[18:19:50] <InPhase> jkk: No agreement is required for the distribution aspects of open source licenses to apply either, because you have no right to distribute a copyrighted work unless granted one by a license, so it is only under the terms of that license that you can distribute open source software.
[18:20:16] <corn266> Bombe I think you thought too far into it. That's how it's calculated but you only provide 1 parameter. In either case, the array type doesn't provide the .get() method

[19:56:53] <kveroneau> sonny, so the user doesn't get spoofed, and knows that they are REALLY on the right website, and not some website that looks and feels like their online banking website.

[19:57:39] <kveroneau> Without an address bar, hackers and scammers would be throwing a huge celebration.
[19:57:45] <sonny> so the web is just like a filesystem then, and the browser is an explorer
[19:58:08] <kveroneau> That's one way to put it.
[19:58:33] <sonny> in the OS, you don't typically show the location of all your resources
[19:58:35] <kveroneau> That was the original concept I do believe, you connected to said server, and requested said file on their server.
[19:58:51] <sonny> though, that would be interesting to be able to inspect an OS that way
[19:58:59] <kveroneau> Nowadays, the URL can mean almost anything.
[19:59:11] <sonny> interesting
[19:59:54] <kveroneau> A lot of web frameworks use routers, so /this/that/there.html might actually be in a database or something.
[20:00:02] <sonny> what's the idea behind URLs with random strings? They look like resources, but their representation is very visible
[20:00:30] <sonny> ok, I think I get it
[20:00:50] <sonny> they are just poorly designed

[21:25:37] <oldlaptop> (That is obviously not how they would phrase it)
[21:25:45] <sonny> nah, video is udp
[21:25:53] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: it'll be udp (or some similar protocol)

If I have stored those three numbers, then the 010, ALL in an array, how do I go about case handling based on types trough switch statements without MASSIVE boilerplate in C?
[21:26:53] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: a few packets
[21:27:05] <d3x0r> I'm kinda surprised they would use such a word - surely they get burried by other references of 'meta' such as 'the meta in games'
[21:27:15] <corn266> [itchyjunk] it'll miss some packets and ___maybe___ some frames but otherwise won't be disturbed
[21:27:25] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: if you're losing whole seconds of video data then even over TCP the connection would be unwatchable -- those packets get lost UDP or TCP
[21:27:31] <bjs> it's just TCP asks them to be resent :)
[21:27:44] <corn266> *buffers*
[21:27:59] <d3x0r> video streams over UDP usually have some sequence and ask for the UDP to be resent - though TCP does it at a lower layer than application
[21:28:02] <[itchyjunk]> I imagined the "buffering" part was browser asking for things to be resent.
[21:28:10] *** Joins: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo)
[21:28:18] <[itchyjunk]> oh UDP also asks for resends?
[21:28:22] <sonny> no
[21:28:25] <oldlaptop> UDP does almost nothing.
[21:28:25] <d3x0r> if the application does
[21:28:30] <bjs> no,  but you can build your own protocol ontop of UDP
[21:28:33] <GeDaMo> If a video packet doesn't arrive in time, there's no point is requesting it to be resent
[21:28:36] <[itchyjunk]> ahh
[21:28:40] <sillymob[m]> [itchyjunk]: your application can request resends. UDP itself says nothing about delivery guarantees.
[21:28:51] <oldlaptop> TCP transparently handles retransmission all by itself; as far as "the browser" knows, it's just waiting for stuff to come through
[21:28:59] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: video streaming will be requesting many packets in the future, if it gets lost and doesn't arrive in time then... you just keep going
[21:29:08] <oldlaptop> whether the network link really is that slow or whether packets are getting dropped on the floor all the time is hidden to it
[21:29:11] <[itchyjunk]> how does you application know what exactly to ask if udp doesn't support such fine grain control?
[21:29:16] <bjs> obviously if you're losing *so much* data you can't, then maybe you have to stop and wait anyway but at that point it's not like TCP "saves" you

[21:29:40] <corn266> [itchyjunk] this is not a criticism, but if you're this interested in the lower layers of networking you should read a network+ book
[21:30:08] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: UDP doesn't dictate what the message/bytes actually are or what they mean. 
[21:30:11] <sonny> [itchyjunk] you literally check if you got data
[21:30:16] <Bou> I'm just glad people are talking about IT things in here for once
[21:30:20] <[itchyjunk]> If i read a book for every topic i was interested in then i'd have read atleast 1 book by now
[21:30:33] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: UDP is like sending letters in the post.  Nothing says they arrive in order or that they all arrive at all.  And nothing stops you sending another letter back asking "I never got letter #3, can you re-send?"
[21:30:34] <sonny> you might implement your own handshake or something
[21:30:34] <oma6__> <sillymob[m]>: For web development

[21:31:33] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: but if it's video, or a livestream or voice chat or something then waiting for things or asking stuff to be re-sent might not be so useful
[21:31:34] <[itchyjunk]> it's interesting that protocol invented so long ago, tcp and udp are both in use
[21:31:38] <oldlaptop> (In many of UDP's applications, however, you're using it precisely because it's better to just forge on ahead without letter #3 and hope nobody notices)
[21:31:39] <nomagno> Not really 'surprisingly'
[21:31:44] <[itchyjunk]> no replacements better than that has been found
[21:31:48] <sonny> ya
[21:31:55] <sonny> just not popular
[21:32:06] <[itchyjunk]> right, makes sense for live chat or anything "live"
[21:32:09] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I'm not saying you'll use exactly UDP in all these cases,  or that even when they do use UDP that they won't use their own protocol on top.  But that it's a trade-off for speed
[21:32:09] <[itchyjunk]> there is no resending
[21:32:10] <sonny> tcp and udp are pretty good
[21:32:14] <nomagno> itchyjunk: There are definitely better replacements that have been found. Just not better enough to justify triggering a mass migration

[21:33:00] <[itchyjunk]> you'ed have to redesign every application ground up for a new protocol?

[21:38:17] <sillymob[m]> people are using JS as a compilation target today. that shows it's desirable eto be able to target programs for a browser. seems logical to make a more efficient compilation target.
[21:38:38] <tomathy> sillymob[m]: phones and post service are a bad analogy because one is digital the other mechanical
[21:38:46] <oma6__> sonny: my experience - wordpress/drupal :) but for speed/rapid building I would like to find something else. I like RoR scaffolding idea in CL, syntax
[21:38:49] <oldlaptop> sillymob[m]: That's already wrong, in that webassembly is probably now a more popular compilation target
[21:38:52] <tomathy> restrict it to human speech sillymob[m] and try again
[21:39:02] <sonny> CL?
[21:39:04] <sillymob[m]> tomathy: OK, so is email going to replace phone calls?
[21:39:09] <d3x0r> compiling for browser is more about taking advantage of tree-shaking (getting rid of functions that are never used) and reducing the overall transmission size 
[21:39:12] <[itchyjunk]> What does "compilation target" mean?
[21:39:26] <tomathy> sillymob[m]: idk probably 
[21:39:27] <sillymob[m]> TCP will never "WIN" over UDP because they aren't good at the same things
[21:39:36] <oldlaptop> [itchyjunk]: "Compilation", strictly speaking, is the process of translating computer programs from one language to another.
[21:39:43] <tomathy> sillymob[m]: i said UDP would win
[21:39:44] <sillymob[m]> it's like saying cars will win over trucks. you don't use them for the same things.
[21:39:49] <sonny> compiler takes a to b, b is the target
[21:39:58] <sillymob[m]> neither one will win, no more than hammers will win over screwdrivers.
[21:40:03] <oma6__> sonny: I mean command line
[21:40:14] <GeDaMo> source -> compiler -> target
[21:40:26] <oldlaptop> Normally, the "target" language is machine code, but it does not need to be. Many compilers have historically targeted C, for example, to take advantage of the convenient fact that practically all machines have a compiler from C to their machine code.

[21:40:39] <tomathy> i hate C
[21:40:45] <coolchrome> compiler translates source code to machine instructions the CPU 'understands'
[21:40:47] <[itchyjunk]> oh javascript used as the thing to produce bytecode one wants
[21:40:47] <d3x0r> C hates you too :)
[21:40:56] <sonny> compiler just translates
[21:40:59] <[itchyjunk]> and this byte code is for a virtual machine the browser runs?
[21:41:03] <sonny> ya
[21:41:13] <nomagno> oldlaptop: That is called transpiling (translation from a non-machine code language to another)
[21:41:16] <oldlaptop> Javascript is, or was until recently, a somewhat popular compilation target simply because of web browsers. (As I say, webassembly has begun to displace it)
[21:41:19] <coolchrome> javascript has bytecode?
[21:41:21] <Guest52> tomathy: C still loves you;;
[21:41:29] <[itchyjunk]> is the browser running a vm or is the browser itself a vm?
[21:41:30] <sillymob[m]> javascript CAN have byte code
[21:41:36] <sillymob[m]> it dpeends on the interpreter
[21:41:38] <nomagno> Guest52: Yes, C is infinite love
[21:41:39] <d3x0r> the memory of that machine is JS TypedArrays that are mapped with Uint8arrya, int32array etc ; alignment becomes very important on WASM machine
[21:41:40] <[itchyjunk]> oh, is chrome book this virual machine ?
[21:41:41] <oldlaptop> nomagno: Sometimes people call it that, yes. It remains a special case of compilation, strictly speaking.
[21:41:43] <sillymob[m]> i can write a JS interpreter with no byte code at all
[21:41:50] <tomathy> channel is too busy
[21:41:51] <d3x0r> WASM VM also doesn't have a stackpointer you can access
[21:42:06] <sonny> oma6__ not sure what benefit you get from another framework tbh
[21:42:18] <coolchrome> i think javascript has a 'Runtine', some 'environment' that executes it. in chrome or firefox, it's partially compiled just-in-time
[21:42:27] <sonny> maybe someone can fill me in on this framework stuff
[21:42:38] <d3x0r> angular, react, ....
[21:42:56] <sonny> yeah, react is probably the way to go
[21:42:59] <d3x0r> they're stuff that gives you a higher level abstractin to patch stuff together
[21:43:06] <sonny> doesn't require npm
[21:43:06] <coolchrome> a framework is a programming environment that attempts to make things easier

[21:43:28] <sillymob[m]> ha, then angular isn't a framework. i'm not sure it has ever made anything easier 😁
[21:43:28] <sonny> so it's just a library?
[21:43:47] <tomathy> C didnt make anything easier

[21:44:30] <sillymob[m]> tomathy: writing portable software, for instance.
[21:44:50] <sonny> I guess that sounds more fancy than library
[21:44:53] <coolchrome> C is easy compared to assembly
[21:45:05] <tomathy> portable software?
[21:45:26] <sonny> be nice if we stop reinventing terminology that isn't very old
[21:45:31] <coolchrome> a framework is more than a library, it can add syntax
[21:45:54] <sonny> macros ?
[21:46:01] <sonny> that'd still be a library
[21:46:05] <coolchrome> portable meaning there's a compiler for various machines you can use to translate the same source code

[21:46:44] <sonny> it just means language binding
[21:46:50] <tomathy> are you saying C works on any CPU?
[21:47:03] <sillymob[m]> tomathy: C can TARGET any CPU
[21:47:03] <coolchrome> your OS is likely programmed in C
[21:47:06] <d3x0r> can't we just leave it at C works
[21:47:24] <coolchrome> altho i think rust and C++ can do a good job at it too
[21:47:38] <sillymob[m]> indeed. C isn't unique in that role.
[21:47:44] <Guest52> what if all software was programmed by obfuscation AI?
[21:47:48] <sonny> never was
[21:48:00] <oldlaptop> coolchrome: Qt, a C++ library providing (mainly) GUI widgets, has come with "added syntax" (for C++) for twenty-five years. Who knew that meant they could market themselves as a fancy "framework" that's "more than a library"?
[21:48:02] <sonny> Guest52 so proprietary software?
[21:48:04] <sillymob[m]> prior to C if new hardware got released you just wrote everything from the ground up. after C being released, you just had to bootstrap a C compiler on your target platform and you could port unix to it.
[21:48:21] <Guest52> sonny: proprietary closed source obfuscated
[21:48:24] <sillymob[m]> it was pretty common to entirely rewrite programs every time a new platform came out.
[21:48:35] <sillymob[m]> after C got popular, that type of thing was greatly minimized.
[21:48:42] <coolchrome> oldlaptop: maybe i should clarify that im strictly talking about web dev frameworks
[21:48:43] <d3x0r> Qt is more on the level of framework... say there's buildings and skyscrapers - not all buildings are skyscrapers
[21:49:07] <sonny> remind me, C was the first language to decouple the IO part?
[21:49:27] <coolchrome> decouple?
[21:49:27] <sillymob[m]> sonny: i don't understand the question.
[21:49:31] <oldlaptop> Are you defining "framework" as "a javascript library that happens to come with a preprocessor", then?

[21:50:47] <sonny> sillymob[m] it's common for older languages to have OS I/O facilities built into the language
[21:50:47] <nomagno> The alternative to cross-platform languages is assembly.
[21:51:06] <sonny> ?
[21:51:13] <MrMobius> or emulation
[21:51:21] <sonny> alternative?

[21:52:02] <sonny> no, it might be the first to have portable IO
[21:52:10] <coolchrome> oldlaptop: my definition of a library is file with source code of functions/classes/macros you can use. you need more than that to add syntax to the language, don't you?
[21:52:12] <sonny> idk how to explain
[21:52:18] <sillymob[m]> sonny: what's portable IO?
[21:52:35] <sonny> stdio works on windows, linux etc
[21:52:43] <nomagno> sonny: C has three distinct implementation 'types': nolibc (portable assembly without any platform-specific features), freestanding (portable assembly but you have info about the system you will by using), and hosted (all the I/O stuff)
[21:52:45] <MrMobius> streams?
[21:53:02] <nomagno> So IO facilities built into C are an implementation detail
[21:53:06] <oldlaptop> coolchrome: The "client-side" javascript "frameworks" generally have one of those "functions you can use" that slurps up the whole page and does a bunch of preprocessing to provide the appearance of "adding syntax to the language".
[21:53:08] <nomagno> You can't actually write portable IO

[21:59:21] <coolchrome> sonny: a standard library is a library of common facilities that the language usually provides/ships with. like stdio.h for C, allowing you to do input/output without having to code it from scratch
[21:59:25] <oldlaptop> I'll make one concession: a lot of "server-side frameworks" do have some kind of templating system that is more complicated than just some library call. (For example, it might come with a special apache module that handles a php-flavored template syntax.)
[21:59:31] <wedr> Spring MVC: with all requests being permitted (meaning anonymous requests are allowed), I still can't find our login page in our legacy Spring MVC system. We're dead meat. I don't even know how to work with Spring MVC.

[22:18:35] <sonny> UML is a good idea
[22:18:42] <CalimeroTeknik> sillymob[m], I mean that I've spent quite some time designing systems before writing them down in programming language code
[22:18:43] <sillymob[m]> CalimeroTeknik: if you have a programming job where you write no code, you aren't programming. that is just a job with a bad titel.
[22:19:12] <sillymob[m]> CalimeroTeknik: sure, but you did eventually sit down and write code.
[22:19:17] <CalimeroTeknik> like a month designing a complex relational schema from client needs before it even touching the postgresql database

[22:19:58] <CalimeroTeknik> sillymob[m], my objection is that one doesn't sit to write code right away, precisely. it's maybe 20% of the entire process as a software engineer
[22:20:02] <SuperNintendoSUX> CalimeroTeknik: but you know how to design it because you will project use cases based on your experience and theory
[22:20:05] <sillymob[m]> CalimeroTeknik: if you wanna be really picky (and i often do) I'm not sure i would consider schema design programming. that is more data modelling.
[22:20:08] <CalimeroTeknik> it's the reward from all the hard work
[22:20:39] <sillymob[m]> CalimeroTeknik: sure. a programmer can have other responsibilities besides generating code. the specific thing i disagree with is one is not a programmer if they NEVER write code. that's like being a chef that never cooks.
[22:20:52] <SuperNintendoSUX> also you don't need a month to design a relational database. this is just overvaluing your hourly price
[22:21:18] <sillymob[m]> SuperNintendoSUX: not necessarily, i've seen some monster schemas.
[22:21:29] <CalimeroTeknik> it's happened to me that I never wrote any code on a project, sillymob[m], and I think that doesn't make me any less of a programmer; I was flying from one programmer to another telling them which algorithms and paradigms they could use here and there

[23:44:53] <apotheon> In a way, the ambiguity about Deckard makes the point that *it doesn't matter whether he's a replicant*.
[23:45:11] <apotheon> I think the point of the movie would be substantially cheapened if there was an official, in-movie answer to the question.
[23:45:16] <sillymob[m]> if he is a replicant, he has some good batteries
[23:45:30] <tomathy> if he's a replicant why is he so weak

[23:46:50] <tomathy> well yes the pleasure models might need to think they're human
[23:46:52] <apotheon> Both Deckard and Rachael had memories of a life lived, and both of them showed no signs of superhuman capabilities (except maybe Rachael's grooming skills).
[23:47:00] <nomagno> I certainly can't think of any vital logical operations missing
