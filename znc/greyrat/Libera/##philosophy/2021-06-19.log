[04:36:42] <arryana> fair
[04:37:04] <arryana> i finished making the candy my father used to bring my mother on special occasions, the place which made it closed ten years ago

[04:37:27] <arryana> it's a pain in the ass, but i didn't see a reason to refuse the request

[04:37:46] <arryana> well
[04:37:57] <arryana> she lost access when she left the tri state area, they didn't ship.
[04:38:27] <arryana> partly because of volume, but mostly because they couldn't guarantee it wouldn't get melted somewhere along the way
[04:38:56] <lalia> Makes sense. When are you taking off? Time's gotta be closing in, right?

[17:58:52] <lalia> Advocating for a theory against the continual spread of human life can be captured through some versions of antinatalist discourse. However, there's a key difference between reasoning through such a theory and simply wishing to not have been born: the latter clearly lacking anything like the need for a theoretical justification for simply being an emotional observation.
[17:59:03] <lalia> So yeah, I'm with arryana. :)
[17:59:19] <ecommence> Just curious has any of you guys ever met anybody else here IRL/video conference call?
[17:59:43] <arryana> in this channel or irc?
[18:00:36] <lalia> I have made personal friendships on IRC, but haven't had a chance to hang out for some years.
[18:00:50] <ecommence> this, but if you have any cool stories please share :)
[18:01:00] <ecommence> lalia: nice
[18:01:00] <arryana> i've got irc friends going back more than 20 years
[18:01:07] <arryana> some of whom i only met in the last few
[18:01:11] <ecommence> cool
[18:01:15] <bougyman> ecommence: tons.
[18:01:26] <bougyman> ecommence: we used to have yearly meetups for #philosophy on efnet
[18:01:31] <pussipupu> I've met a few IRC people, only married one of them though
[18:01:36] <arryana> haha
[18:01:39] <bougyman> pussipupu: haha, me too!
[18:01:59] <lalia> In my case every meet up has involved drinks, food, and games.
[18:02:00] <pussipupu> It's the best matchmaking system!
[18:02:05] <ecommence> :D
[18:02:10] <pussipupu> not hugely efficient, but I'm happy with it
[18:02:28] <arryana> now that you mention it, i had several irc friends at my wedding
[18:02:39] <arryana> though they'd become real life friends for years by then
[18:02:52] <lalia> I met fattratt and Fausta on efnet, years ago.
[18:03:02] <lalia> They used to hang out on our channel too.
[18:03:12] <arryana> pook from efnet was the one i knew longest before meetin
[18:04:31] <arryana> i imagine i will eventually meet someone from here
[18:04:49] <arryana> pussipupu and partner will visit scotland sometime
[18:04:50] <pussipupu> I dispute the implication that IRC isn't part of real life though
[18:04:53] <ecommence> arryana: make that everyone
[18:04:57] <lalia> Haven't heard from either of'em for a while. Loved chatting with the rat being about French philosophers. That one really had some knowledge to share.
[18:05:04] <arryana> why would i meet everyone from here?
[18:05:09] <pussipupu> it's fully casually embedded
[18:05:10] <ecommence> yeah those are some great stories but we can't keep living in the past. let's meet up you guys!
[18:05:13] <ecommence> my treat :D
[18:05:15] <arryana> uh
[18:05:17] <ecommence> arryana: why not?
[18:05:25] <ecommence> half are probably bots anyway
[18:05:27] <arryana> because i value my time highly
[18:05:40] <pussipupu> arryana at this rate the border might not open again...
[18:05:46] <arryana> yeesh
[18:05:47] <ecommence> and what happened to efnet? how come nobody's going back there?
[18:05:58] <ecommence> arryana: ah, you're one of thoooooooooooose :P
[18:06:06] <lalia> I'm in SLC and welcome visits from folks who make it to the area. :)
[18:06:07] <arryana> where do you think everyone's going to meet and you can afford to pay for it?
[18:06:08] <ecommence> nah i get that
[18:06:23] <lalia> Always happy to grab a drink or a bite with online friendlies.
[18:06:28] <ecommence> maybe :D
[18:06:44] <pussipupu> God keeps biting her harness
[18:06:53] <arryana> i'll meet people, but only after i know them
[18:06:54] <ecommence> choose a random place on a map is what i say
[18:07:02] <arryana> right.  and you're paying airfare?
[18:07:05] <pussipupu> but also she's too stupid to be safely let off it
[18:07:14] <arryana> aww, gods are complicated things
[18:07:23] <ecommence> as long as you're not too picky with the accommodations
[18:07:27] <pussipupu> Oh, I chose Antarctica
[18:07:38] <arryana> oooh
[18:07:39] <arryana> good pick
[18:07:43] <pussipupu> i'mma hug me some penguins
[18:07:45] <lalia> I stopped going on any other IRC networks when the vast majority of my friendlies moved to Freenode and then here to Libera.
[18:07:45] <ecommence> :)
[18:07:54] <arryana> i want to hug a baby seal
[18:08:05] <lalia> efnet started to be only folks I never got along with eventually. :D
[18:08:12] <arryana> haha
[18:08:16] <pussipupu> They have these adorable fresh water seals here up north
[18:08:31] <ecommence> seals look just like dogs!!
[18:08:48] <ecommence> waterdogs we used to call them
[18:08:49] <arryana> my dogs would wave their flippers in outrage to hear that
[18:08:56] <pussipupu> the feet are quite different :p
[18:08:59] <pussipupu> jinz
[18:09:02] <arryana> haha
[18:09:06] <lalia> Word, it's gonna be a long day, I better get started on cleaning and coffee.
[18:09:10] <arryana> aww
[18:09:15] <arryana> it is indeed going to be a long day
[18:09:18] <arryana> but i'm not facing it yet
[18:09:19] <ecommence> THIS
[18:09:32] <lalia> Partner has a catering gig all day today that starts soonish
[18:09:36] <arryana> oooh
[18:09:46] <arryana> my 80 year old mother wants me to spend the day there
[18:09:48] <ecommence> every time the topic of dog is brought up everybody starts laughing and making cute faces
[18:09:48] <lalia> So I'll be hanging out with kiddo in 100F+ heat all day.
[18:09:54] <arryana> after doing her shopping and laundry
[18:09:56] <ecommence> it's so lovely
