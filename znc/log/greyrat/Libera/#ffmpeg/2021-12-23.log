[02:24:29] <jarthur> jamra if it actually is an mp4 file with an actual AAC stream, you can skip the transcode for a lossless extraction:   -c:a copy (and no -b:a or -ar)
[02:25:09] <jamra> Ok I'll try it

[02:38:30] <jamra> Ok I will look into it. I've seen this flag before in some of the c code.
[02:39:10] <jamra> I'm trying to take the audio from the m4a file and overwrite _some_ of the target video with it. Like a voiceover. That's the gist of it.
[02:42:41] <jarthur> Cool. Well, if you're doing a multiple step operation that includes the extraction first, would definitely be better to start with a better quality extraction (i.e. "copy").
[02:49:06] <jamra> That's definitely right. I'm just testing the second part where I overlay the audio and am trying to make sure the time_base matches.

[03:42:45] <john21> jamra actually there is no way to do that in one step, like just image-seq to mov with offset?
[03:44:31] <furq> john21: -itsoffset
[03:45:38] <furq> something like -itsoffset 33.4 -start_number 1001 %04d.png

[03:46:32] <john21> yes this part is ok, but how to start the move also from 1001 frame
[03:46:41] <furq> -start_number
[03:47:32] <furq> that only works for image sequences otherwise you'd need to convert the frame number to a timestamp and use -ss
[03:47:39] <furq> or use -vf select

[03:49:45] <john21> thanks furq, its still a bit unclear...
[03:51:05] <john21> so even if my seq start from 1001 and if I create mov than I need first to set timestamp for image seq and use -ss?
[03:52:34] <furq> if you just use -start_number then the output video will start from 00:00
[03:52:39] <furq> if you want it to start delayed then use -itsoffset
[03:52:57] <john21> for example ffmpeg -start_number 1001 and the rest is a bit unclear..
[03:52:59] <furq> -ss would have the same effect as -start_number for inputs that aren't image sequences
[03:54:26] <john21> yes I've tried the -itsoffset and the mov got an offset but the video starts still from 1
[03:55:09] <furq> is there another stream in the file
[03:55:16] <furq> otherwise players will probably just ignore the offset
[03:56:11] <john21> so if I use offset it works,  in the move all is fine but till the offset there is a still image in move
[03:56:27] <john21> from frame 1
[03:57:15] <furq> if you just want a black screen before the video starts then use -vf tpad
[03:57:22] <furq> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#tpad
[03:57:51] <john21> what I want is to mov start from 1001 frame

[04:48:55] <jamra> Yeah. That is to my dismay.
[04:49:11] <jamra> I either have to do it with ffmpeg or get into the libs underneath which is grueling.
[04:49:49] <kepstin> (personally, i'd extract the audio track, do the audio mixing for the voiceover there, export the result, then use ffmpeg to replace the audio track)
[04:50:00] <kepstin> do the audio mixing in audacity or something
[04:55:38] <jamra> My intent is to fully replace the audio with the voiceover
[04:56:00] <jamra> So I already have the audio. I just need to overwrite a segment of the mp4's audio stream.
[04:56:15] <jamra> I made sure it's the same time_base too
[04:57:15] <kepstin> that unfortunately doesn't really make it easier; the tricky part when using the ffmpeg cli tool is designing a filter graph to do the audio inserts at the correct time

[20:42:55] <Forlorn> Hi, how do I open up a udp stream with ffmpeg?
[20:43:30] <JEEB> just utilize the udp protocol (udp://). if you are having specific issues, feel free to add details
[20:45:16] <Forlorn> ffmpeg -i music.mp3 -f rtp rtp://192.168.1.2:1234
[20:45:35] <Forlorn> ffplay rtp://192.168.1.2:1234 results in no feedback
[20:45:47] <Forlorn> I run these on two different devices on the same network

[20:46:02] <Forlorn> with the correct addresses
[20:47:31] <JEEB> I mostly deal with multicast (since it doesn't require "listening" on one side and the other side sending stuff to that listener) and without the rtp layer, but have you checked with `netstat -lpn` and/or strace or something on both sides that it does attempt to utilize the correct network interface

[20:48:19] <JEEB> also music.mp3 is probably going to be read as fast as possible with that ffmpeg.c command line
[20:49:01] <JEEB> -re (rate emulation) before -i (in other words, an input side setting) might help with it going through too quickly

[20:53:26] <Forlorn> I send it out to 239.5.5.5:5555 and it seems to be receiving a signal
[20:54:07] <JEEB> yup, in a sense multicast is much simpler :D just throwing packets into aether
[20:54:16] <Forlorn> but where does it go?
[20:54:24] <Forlorn> on my local network, or out to the internet?
[20:54:35] <Forlorn> I have no clue what 239.5.5.5 even means, lol
[20:54:53] <Forlorn> well... Reading up on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_multicast
[20:54:57] <JEEB> it's just a number as far as I know :D one of the many multicast addresses
[20:55:10] <JEEB> generally speaking routers don't pass this stuff outside of LAN
[20:55:13] <Forlorn> Well, thanks for introducing me to a new subject <3
[20:55:31] <Forlorn> Oh, alright, that is good to know
[20:56:05] <JEEB> but generally if I need something specifically limited I set localaddr to specify the local address of the interface I want it to bind to
[20:56:14] <JEEB> by default it utilizes some sort of default
[20:56:45] <JEEB> f.ex. in some cases I utilize 100% localhost multicast because it lets you share a stream in a simple manner
[20:56:54] <JEEB> -localaddr 127.0.0.1 and all that jazz
[20:57:16] <JEEB> (due to the layering of the RTP stuff in FFmpeg the option might or might not get passed onto the underlying UDP protocol)
[20:57:26] <JEEB> if you just utilize udp:// it definitely works
[20:58:51] <JEEB> but yea, if you have a fancy shmancy TV or something, you might be surprised how much it might be talking over UDP multicast
[20:59:01] <JEEB> since they usually advertise UPnP etc features over multicast
[20:59:16] <JEEB> so if you just sit down and listen, you'll get various multicast stuff in :D
