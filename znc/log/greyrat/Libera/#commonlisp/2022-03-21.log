[03:08:54] <Xach> hashfunc569: it's used to get a symbol that's used only for its name.
[03:08:57] <mfiano> #: is a reader macro for "uninterned symbol"
[03:09:23] <Xach> if you use a regular symbol, you could argue it "clutters" some random package by interning unnecessarily. same with a keyword symbol.
[03:09:36] <mfiano> Any other symbol is interned (allocated the first time it is read, and placed in a lookup table, called a package)
[03:09:50] <Xach> using a string can cause trouble with case conversion under some circumstances

[03:11:26] <mfiano> uninterned symbols are created anew everytime they are READ
[03:11:53] <mfiano> in this case, in-package takes a "package designator". I'll let you go look up in the glossary what that means.

[03:19:50] <pillton> I probably need to think about this more, but the use of symbols for package names seems problematic to me when your package uses the COMMON-LISP package. The whole readtable-case argument seems moot when the COMMON-LISP package and all of its exported symbols are specified to be upper case. One would have to go to a great deal of effort to write code which is invariant to READTABLE-CASE.
[03:21:36] <Xach> Packages are never named by symbols. Symbols are sometimes used to get a string to name a package.

[03:21:43] <Xach> Often used, even.
[03:22:17] <pillton> Sure, but the name of the package changes as a function of READTABLE-CASE.
[03:23:12] <Xach> Yes. Which is, I think, an advantage.
[03:23:49] <pillton> Well you should write a blog post on it. I can't see the advantages.
[03:24:53] <Xach> pillton: for one, if you make a package with (defpackage "FOO" ...) you might have to refer to it with a package prefix of |FOO|. But if you use a symbol to designate its name, you can write the prefix the same as you wrote the symbol in the definition.

[07:54:04] <Spawns_Carpeting> Shinmera: that is true but its still good to know that the library you are downloading is the one you really requested. for example if its author is a known trustworthy user or whatever
[07:56:00] <Spawns_Carpeting> well security is always on a spectrum anyways, just because some risks exist doesn't mean we shouldn't mitigate what we can

[09:54:04] <unixlisp> Now we can compare the performace of top three CL at x86-64 port, (SBCL 2.2.2, ALLEGRO free express 10.1, LISPWORKS personal edition 7.1.2), using (cl-bench:bench-run). We can see SBCL is fastest in three tests of seven tests about CLOS.
[09:55:01] <beach> And SBCL is not that fast with generic dispatch I think.

[10:08:01] <unixlisp> about defmethod, "time taken to compile and execute the DEFMETHOD forms".  I think that every big macro has a cost.
[10:09:41] *** Quits: unixlisp (~unixlisp@2409:8a3c:5400:9ff0:fe08:4aff:fe66:ec11) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:09:57] <beach> I am not sure the cost is with the macro.  The expansion has to be compiled, and the time it takes varies with how much the compiler does.  But again, DEFMETHOD is usually a compile-time thing to do, so it usually should not have any great impact on run-time performance

[10:10:35] <beach> The important performance aspect of CLOS is generic dispatch.
[10:11:33] <unixlisp> Is there a simple test?
[10:12:36] <beach> I haven't given it any thought.  It is probably hard to isolate the generic dispatch itself from the actual work done by the method being called.

[10:33:43] <unixlisp> What is a good irc client? this gamja irc client always has a connection error.
[10:34:43] <beach> I don't know, but I use ERC for Emacs so that I can get my usual abbrevs and my usual spell checker.  Most people don't seem to care about those, judging from the way they type.
[10:35:37] <unixlisp> there are some irc clients in CL, but I have not try them.
[10:36:11] <beach> Mainly beirc.  scymtym is working on it, but there is still no spell checker.
[10:36:25] <rotateq> I'm happy I can use portacle on the working machine (no root for me) so also via ERC and of course for saner programming. But sometimes the handshake for TLS fails due to the gnutls.c file it says then.
[10:37:09] <rotateq> Ah right, I wanted to try beirc too now that I can get some stuff done with McCLIM.
[10:37:20] <beach> Once beirc has abbrevs and a spell checker, I will very likely switch.
