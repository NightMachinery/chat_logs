[03:55:52] <wenxin> one more question about the size of pointer. I knew that the size of pointer is equals to the size of data type that the pointer to. But why? I mean it's just an address after all, not the really value
[03:56:13] <caze> wenxin: That is not true.
[03:57:09] <caze> ,cc printf("sizeof (char) = %zu, sizeof (char *) = %zu", sizeof (char), sizeof (char *));
[03:57:12] <candide> caze: sizeof (char) = 1, sizeof (char *) = 8
[03:57:58] <omegatron> the size of a pointer depends on the machine you compile for ; to make it simple, usually this is 32-bit on 32-bit machines and 64-bit on 64-bit machines (there are variations of course)

[03:58:40] <trinity> on amd64 printf("%d\t%d\n", sizeof(int), sizeof(int *)); prints 4\t8
[03:59:15] <fizzie> The size of a pointer may _depend_ on the type it points at, though.
[03:59:20] <wenxin> omegatron:  this makes sense. the pointer just hold the address, so it should equals to the size of register
[03:59:29] <fizzie> As in, pointers to different types can have different representations.

[03:59:45] <fizzie> Or put another way, `sizeof (char *)` need not equal `sizeof (int *)`.
[04:00:25] <trinity> caze: does it matter in this particular instance?

[13:48:19] <knittl> If I have a global array, why doesn't a function see updates from main to the array values?
[13:48:48] <caze> You don't have a "global" array.
[13:49:51] <knittl> basically: static int a[1] = {0}; static void f() { printf("%d\n, a[0]); } int main(void) { a[0] = 42; f(); } /* prints 0, not 42 */
[13:50:41] <knittl> sorry, quote missing in printf. but you should get the idea
[13:51:00] <caze> Can you make a testcase?
[13:51:20] <knittl> hm. the simple example works. there must be something wrong with the other file
[13:51:50] <knittl> yeah, give me a minute, I will create a paste :)
[13:51:57] <dave0> knittl: if you declare your array static, each file will have it's own copy of the array
[13:52:10] <knittl> dave0: only a isingle file
[13:52:21] <caze> It shouldn't matter though, if there's only one file, which is why you need to make a testcase that more accurately reflects your problem.

[14:28:28] <heiner_> scanf() is powerful, but it's easy to get surprising results. I rarely see it in production code.
[14:29:25] <chiselfuse> i just can't seem to find functionality to match a string in scanf though
[14:29:28] <heiner_> strtok() reads tokens separated by delimiters (as whitespace). strtok_r() does the same, but does not modify the input buffer

[14:37:32] <chiselfuse> this is all so destructive...
[14:37:35] <heiner_> As an alternative, strcspn() could be used to parse the input string

[14:39:19] <heiner_> disadvantage: you couldn't work with zero-terminated strings, but had to copy the relevant parts out of the source string yourself
[14:40:01] <chiselfuse> trenka: does it look for a delimiter and replace it with a \0 and return the token before it?
[14:40:04] <dave0> chiselfuse: if it's exactly those letters, you can use strstr() to find it
[14:40:17] <trenka> the thing with strtok_r is that you can use it for 2 string simultaniously

[16:41:55] <NRK[m]> i remember seeing `fun(int a[static 5])` or something along those lines. not sure if it's later C addition, compiler extension or just a c++ thing
[16:42:25] <caze> NRK[m]: That's an overloading of the static keyword that has nothing to do with its meaning in other contexts.

[21:05:44] <sham1> IIRC the point is to be able to hold any given data pointer
[21:05:57] <Learath2> Well the point is sometimes you want generic things. e.g. a generic container
[21:06:34] <johnjaye> like if i need a list of items of different types? like in python a list [1,"a", True]
[21:06:48] <johnjaye> or maybe a linked list of void *
[21:08:09] <sham1> Well I'd say that even in Python and such, having heterogenious lists like that is usually a bad sign, unless you're actually using them as tuples of sorts
[21:08:16] <sham1> As in, they'd have a fixed size
[21:08:20] <Learath2> You could store different types but then you'd need to keep track of the type externally, which you'd usually use a union for instead of a void *
[21:08:39] <johnjaye> ok. i should probably stop being socratic for a moment and do some work though
[21:08:41] <Learath2> What I meant by generic container was more to highlight the fact that you don't need to reimplement the container for different types

[23:17:48] <fizzie> I don't know which C tools would make that particularly convenient. Valgrind has a gdbserver thing for extracting information about a live process.
[23:19:14] <fizzie> Maybe looking for a "memory profiler" type of tool rather than a conventional leak-checker would be useful too.

[23:22:45] <fizzie> (For example, Google's got that thing that's more C++-oriented, but I imagine it ought to work for C programs too; you can ask it to subtract two profiles to see what's changed.)

[23:42:07] <jan_> Does anyone have an idea why in style guide of plan9 there is this rule: automatic variables (local variables inside a function) are never initialized at declaration. What was the reasoning behind that?

[23:48:33] <sham1> Probably something to do with listing all the automatic variables at the beginning of the block
