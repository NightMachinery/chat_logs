[00:01:20] <StayHungry> you mean, closeness to nature?
[00:01:20] <binia> would that be right? or should I go with Close to the Nature?

[02:36:31] <bin> hello StayHungry 
[02:36:34] <StayHungry> as a grown-up American, what do you think about referring to a female person as a gal?

[02:50:50] <bin> it depends on the context
[02:50:58] <bin> Use it in a sentence
[02:52:06] <StayHungry> I studied opinions about this word at https://www.girlscantwhat.com/weekly-poll-is-the-word-gal-offensive/ and they were divided. especially it stuck in my memory that at one time they were supposedly referring to black women from the south states.
[02:54:06] <StayHungry> oops, *southern
[02:55:13] <LuisM14> lol, horrible grammar on that product :P
[02:57:16] <bin> StayHungry: well I definitely don't think it's offensive. 
[02:57:22] <bin> There's nothing offensive about it to me
[02:57:38] <StayHungry> bin: but what's the difference between gal and girl then?

[03:01:04] <LuisM14> same here
[03:07:39] <GuiToris> ok, I'm super tired, but can someone check this out? I think we've made a mistake here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/pe7nm5fqfvnsifx/7.mp3?dl=0
[03:08:09] <GuiToris> I'm afraid I made the original worse
[03:09:56] <GuiToris> LuisM14, can I get you to listen to the recording, I can't stay up for too long
[03:10:45] <GuiToris> you know this was the original: https://www.dropbox.com/s/z0feflpjma63gqi/orig.mp3?dl=0
[03:11:13] <GuiToris> he might have said; we'd love it if you -would- wanted to come to the class, and he took back the would
[03:11:21] <GuiToris> as it isn't supposed to be grammatical after 'if'
[03:12:06] <GuiToris> bin, are you around?
[03:12:32] <StayHungry> GuiToris: voice says 'we'd love it if you'd come to the class', so?
[03:12:57] <bin> GuiToris: yeah
[03:12:59] <bin> sory of
[03:13:03] <bin> sort*
[03:13:08] <GuiToris> StayHungry, because that's what I did, but this shouldn't be okay
[03:13:25] <GuiToris> bin, do you think I should remove the first 'would' and it would be okay?
[03:13:40] <GuiToris> 'we'd love it if you wanted to come to the class'
[03:13:50] <GuiToris> I hope that's what he meant to say
[03:14:15] <GuiToris> I mean can you hear the audio that way?
[03:14:21] <bin> "we'd love it if you would come to the class"
[03:14:52] <GuiToris> this is the first, I trimmed the 2 noise that we couldn't understand
[03:14:59] <GuiToris> bin, https://www.dropbox.com/s/z0feflpjma63gqi/orig.mp3?dl=0
[03:15:08] <GuiToris> this is the original
[03:15:12] <bin> gimme 2 minutes 
[03:17:48] <bin> that doesnt sound right
[03:17:51] <bin> it sounds edited
[03:18:09] <GuiToris> the orig.mp3 is not edited
[03:18:12] <bin> ok
[03:18:23] <GuiToris> the first one is indeed
[03:18:32] <GuiToris> do you think that noise is 'wanted'?
[03:18:42] <bin> I don't know
[03:18:54] <bin> I guess
[03:19:03] <bin> yeah
[03:19:06] <bin> that's the closest thing
[03:19:23] <GuiToris> thank you, I'll remove the 'would' and leave wanted, as it is much more grammatical
[03:19:35] <bin> what is this for
[03:19:53] <bin> he says "I'd love it would, uh, wanted to come to the class"
[03:20:09] <GuiToris> I'd?
[03:20:13] <GuiToris> isn't it we'd?
[03:21:09] <GuiToris> I'm making virtual flashcard of these, I just don't want mistakes in them
[03:23:33] <bin> er
[03:23:38] <bin> "I'd love it if you would"
[03:23:42] <bin> I'm tired
[03:24:12] <bin> oh you're not transcribing
[03:24:56] <GuiToris> I think I am
[03:25:49] <bin> Well which is
[03:25:51] <bin> it
[03:26:00] <bin> are you transcribing it, or are you erasing mistakes?
[03:26:37] <GuiToris> in this order, I transcribed it, and then fix mistakes
[03:26:55] <GuiToris> I can't fix the audio if I don't know what he's saying
[03:27:05] <bin> right ok
[03:27:32] <bin> so he says "I'd love it if you would, uh, wanted to come to the class" so the flash card might say "I'd love it if you wanted to come to the class"
[03:27:38] <bin> but "would" is also valid
[03:27:41] <bin> neither is incorrect
[03:28:49] <GuiToris> thanks a lot :) I really must go now, it's 2 am and I won't be able to get up in the morning

[07:22:32] <twb> Is there a proper term for the kind of fences they have between suburban houses in australia?
[07:23:42] <twb> It's cheap timber planks in a sort of _-_-_-_ pattern when looked at from above, and then every arms-breadth or so, on one side, is an upright beam, and then there are two thick beams running horizonally at about groin and nipple height
[07:24:24] <twb> It completely blocks eyelines, whereas just "fence" to me means more like a couple of wires around some star pickets
[07:24:28] <mwsb> Paling fence?
[07:24:45] <twb> mwsb: perfect
[07:25:14] <twb> paling can apparently have gaps between the planks, but usually doesn't

[07:26:21] <twb> in wa.au they use a kind of wavy corrugated asbestos stuff instead
[07:26:50] <mwsb> If the palings used are young/fresh, they can shrink as they dry out I guess, though I suspect you mean something else when you say "gap"
[07:28:03] <twb> https://www.maltonfencingcontractors.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMGP0014.jpg <-- intentional gap
[07:28:16] <mwsb> Ahh yeah

[12:50:08] <twb> I cannot think of a case where they are different

[15:48:12] <pussipupu> I don't know what if anything the rules are here, but certainly neither gendered nor ungendered public toilets are very uncommon
[15:48:30] <pussipupu> I've known lots of small restaurants to have only one toilet in the UK
[15:48:32] <jessicara> not sure what the actual rules are here either
[15:48:47] <pussipupu> so that's unisex by default
[15:49:03] <jessicara> seems people have bad associations with unisex toilets from what i've heard, but never actually seen one to know
[15:49:07] <huf> it's probably going to be something very weird like it's legal in scotland and in streets that are older than 1729
[15:49:12] <huf> since it's the UK
[15:49:53] <jessicara> at least the gendered toilets have the same issue people seem afraid of with unisex ones: a sea of junkies hanging outside them

[15:57:07] <twb> The argument for having urinals *at all* is that waste management is much easier if you have separate dry(ish) poo, and also higher throughput (lower cost, faster use)

[16:09:29] <StayHungry> jessicara: we use unisex booths in cases where there is little space (e.g. in metro stations, in trains, or in pubs) or when it affects the environment (e.g. in a forest park, where they simply prefer to be put up more often). other than that, such as large shopping malls, they use large gender-specific rooms https://s3.rokket.space/t_1TwFs9.png

[19:28:43] <StayHungry> Looney: the use of the word crap may indicate a certain restlessness and an infantile desire to get results faster than cognitive ability allows. anglia, in addition to russia, china and a couple of other civilizations, have been around for a very long time, so it takes time to start feeling the subtleties. and you can't understand them all for the rest of your life. be patient and it will be rewarded. :)
[19:29:30] <Looney> So I found myself wondering whether the Grim Reaper is a dude (or is there a chick under the hood?) who is "fierce in disposition or action", or who is "stern or forbidding in action or appearance", or who is just depressing/scary/worrying, etc. Meh
[19:30:02] <blkshp> Grim reaper is the physical manifestation of death
[19:30:46] <blkshp> Death is neither male nor female. (except usually represented as one of the other. In The Sandman books she is female)
[19:31:42] <Looney> The male/female thing was a joke, actually, I think it's usually depicted as a skeleton
[19:32:06] <blkshp> well 15 minutes ago she was feeding the pidgeons with her brother "Dream".

[19:55:19] <Looney> well, I didn't mean phonetically. Just translating the letters. If you did that considering phonetics too, then it would probably look completely intelligible

[19:55:36] <huf> some do, definitely
[19:55:56] <huf> I guess you can figure that sort of thing out

[19:58:47] <Looney> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet#Modern_alphabet

[23:14:43] <Looney> good question, I suppose it's ambiguous (wait for confirmation by someone else)
[23:15:52] <blkshp> Agreed.
[23:16:15] <LuisP18> good question indeed
[23:16:16] <blkshp> It can be either but you'd know which if you were such a scholar or the person you're talking to is.
[23:17:42] <toretto> But I'm not a scholar. I'm writing this to a professor or scholar. I *must* not call myself as an "eminent scholar", but rather call him as such.

[23:18:13] <toretto> Given that, I'm not sure how to frame that sentence.
[23:18:50] <blkshp> They will know it means them and not you.
[23:19:09] <blkshp> but you could always "As you're an eminent..."

[23:19:36] <toretto> blkshp: Yeah, that one sounds better.
[23:20:24] <StayHungry> toretto: 'being an eminent scholar of XYC, could be so kind to tell…'
[23:20:35] <LuisP18> as the eminent scholar that you are, i must confess!
[23:21:56] <StayHungry> *…could you be so kind…
[23:26:20] <StayHungry> Looney: are you aware of the difference between eminent and prominent?

[23:38:05] <Looney> Eminem is an eminent rapper
[23:38:20] <ash_worksi> given there are operations you can perform over N explicit entities *OR* you could perform the operations across all entities associated with X... how would you describe the multiplicity of these operations? The words that come to mind are "bulk" and "blanket" respectively
[23:38:38] *** Quits: HvszrStykp (~X@81.171.62.23) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:38:43] <ash_worksi> but I don't like the word blankey
[23:38:45] <ash_worksi> blanket*
[23:39:04] <ash_worksi> and I feel like there's a more programmy word for that distinction
[23:39:15] <StayHungry> Looney: eminent -> recognized for reputation (architect), prominent -> recognized since it's easy to notice (building) 
[23:40:58] <ash_worksi> perhaps "mass" is relevant

[23:43:56] <Looney> ash_worksi I also heard the word "batch" used in such contexts
[23:44:53] <ash_worksi> yeah... I mean, those are great words, but I am looking for something that really drives home the point of "all within X" ... perhaps "CategoricBulkOperation"
[23:45:21] <ash_worksi> vs BulkSelectionOperation
[23:46:21] <StayHungry> ash_worksi: try ##programming
[23:50:02] <Looney> it might depend on the specific context you are dealing with (databases, files, variables, math, etc.)
