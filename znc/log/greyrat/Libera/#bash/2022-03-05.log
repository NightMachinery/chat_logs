[00:21:04] <mx08> Hi,
[00:21:42] <mx08> I'm looking for a pure bash solution to extract the ID out of /etc/os-release, that does not involve sourcing it (for security reasons)
[00:22:04] <mx08> For now I have the following: while read -r line; do [[ "$line" =~ ^ID= ]] && { declare $line; break; }; done < /etc/os-release
[00:22:21] *** Joins: Masterphi (~Masterphi@user/masterphi)
[00:22:26] <mx08> But it does not remove quotes around the value of ID...
[00:23:22] <mx08> Actually I have quotes around every occurence of $line, missed the last one. So I meant: while read -r line; do [[ "$line" =~ ^ID= ]] && { declare "$line"; break; }; done < /etc/os-release
[00:23:54] <geirha> it's meant to be sourced, so just source it
[00:24:45] <Earnest> Quite explicitly so
[00:25:00] <mx08> Hm okay, I have read on SO that sourcing is not ideal: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/432816/grab-id-of-os-from-etc-os-release
[00:25:03] <mx08> But okay
[00:25:11] <geirha> if /etc/os-release contains malicious code, the system is already compromised
[00:25:37] <Friithian> if you can't trust os-releaseâ€¦ yeah it's all fucked
[00:25:38] <mx08> But then I have to source *all* variables from it, right?
[00:25:57] <Friithian> is that an issue?
[00:26:14] <Earnest> mx08: id=$(. /etc/os-release && printf %s "$ID")
[00:26:17] <mx08> It kind of pollutes my env and may overwrite some variables maybe?
[00:26:26] <mx08> Ah ok
[00:26:28] <mx08> cool thx

[03:43:07] <xmb> i dont think that paste will work there, besides i dunno what it does, nor the tr much
[03:43:27] <emanuele6> xmb: `paste -s -' is for vertical to horizontal?
[03:43:47] <emanuele6> it's `tr' that converts whitespace to newlines
[03:43:48] <xmb> i need horizontal to vertical

[03:44:29] <emanuele6> xmb: what do you mean by "horizontal to vertical" then?
[03:44:32] <xmb> the [\n*] means clamp multiple spaces to one space ?

[06:21:58] <kurahaupo> OnlineCop: ISO/IEC-646 ("ASCII") was initially standardized in 1964. Some sections were based on the layout of a teletype machine, which had Â« ! " # $ % & ' ( ) Â» on the shifted digits 1 through 9. Codes were carefully selected so that shift & ctrl could operate as simple bit masks.
[06:21:59] <kurahaupo> OnlineCop: The pairs [] and {}  had to be squished into the "national character ranges" which may account for the non adjacency - though they differ by only a single bit, so in that sense they are adjacent.
[06:25:25] <emanuele6> i think [] and {} are positioned where they are in the ascii table because {} is supposed to be the "lowercase version" of [] iirc

[13:31:07] <xmb> hi
[13:31:17] <homogol> what's the difference between ;& and ;;& in bash? bash manual is so obscure about it
[13:31:25] <homogol> in case statements
[13:32:35] <Earnest> homogol: One is unconditional fallthrough, the other checks
[13:33:00] <Earnest> It's important to keep the synopsis in mind: case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac
[13:33:13] <Earnest> > Using ;& in place of ;; causes  execution to  continue  with the list associated with the next set of patterns.
[13:33:17] <homogol> what on earth is the use case for an unconditionanl fallthrough in a case statement?
[13:33:27] <Earnest> > Using ;;& in place of ;; causes the shell to test the next pattern list in the statement, if any, and execute any associated list on a successful match, continuing the case statement execution as if the pattern list had not matched

[13:34:06] <Earnest> Here you can see where 'list' comes from, and what a pattern is.  ;& fallsthrough to the next *list* without testing the pattern.  ;;& does test it
[13:34:53] <homogol> yeah I DO get it what ;& does just don't find a use case for it. just why?
[13:35:30] <Earnest> homogol: Imagine matching against a threshold, 5) ... 4) ... 3) ... and you want all lists to execute in that manner based on the threshold it matches
[13:35:47] <Earnest> 4,3,2,1 or 2,1 or 3,2,1 etc.  This is how fallthrough works normally, in say C

[13:39:26] <homogol>  m being dumb if it doesn't check the condition why even use case statement?
[13:39:52] <Earnest> homogol: How would you implement this otherwise?
[13:40:00] <Earnest> With a for loop?
[13:41:14] <homogol> in an if statement all of them
[13:41:24] <homogol> doit 15; doit 16 ;...
[13:41:37] <Earnest> I don't follow
[13:42:03] <Earnest> This is how C works, I'm surprised you find it strange.  I don't see how an if statement would help here
[13:42:14] <homogol> if the condtion isn't important why have something to check it. that 's  what I'm saying
[13:42:21] <homogol> why case statement
[13:42:25] <Earnest> The first condition is important
[13:43:10] <Earnest> If the condition is '20', it'll /start/ at the pattern matching 20 and continue through the rest.
[13:43:55] <Earnest> If this was to be done with just if statements, then you would have to place an if statement for each potential match and duplicate the sequence under each

[13:46:41] <Earnest> Do you think the patterns in the case statement do /nothing/?
[13:47:45] <Earnest> homogol: An equivalent with if statements would be: if 1 then; 1; 2; 3; fi -- if 2 then; 2; 3; fi -- if 3 then 3; fi
[13:49:04] <homogol> ok that was my stupidity, I thought if you use ;& the case would've start from the begining

[14:35:43] <kurahaupo> Friithian: the motivation for the !.sh factoid is that the stability of the names of programs (including scripts) is extremely important, because they are the interface for other programs to invoke them, and so they should be chosen with care.
[14:35:43] <kurahaupo> Consequently there are (or should be) several differences between a script in a source tree, and "the same" script installed in a usable bin directory. One such difference is its name: a suffix is useful in a source tree, but in a bin directory it starts out being pointless and gets worse as it obstructs replacing the script with something written in a different language later on.

[17:56:08] <Earnest> If you want the ability to start and stop a long running script, then use a supervisor that can do that (from systemd to daemontools and runit).  If you don't want to use those, or cannot, then write your own basic supervisor
[17:57:01] <phogg> if you want to support graceful stop from within your script, that's when you may have to modify it
[17:57:43] <Earnest> That is a feature irrelevant to daemon/service though
[17:57:49] <phogg> indeed
[17:58:12] <Earnest> But I don't think they're using the word "daemon" correctly here, it has a specific technical meaning so there's some confusion

[18:48:15] <Earnest> For grep this problem is highlighted the most because without a way to signal end-of-options there would be only way to search for the pattern --

[18:50:31] <phogg> but otherwise it would mostly Do What I Mean

[18:51:28] <phogg> and the good sense to support --
[18:51:40] <Earnest> Fortunately most do
[18:52:06] <Earnest> But on the other hand, given what the CLI is, I don't see it being unreasonable to expect people to read the documentation for the commands they use
[18:52:38] <Earnest> auto-complete helps with the problem of discoverability, but it's not a substitute for documentation, and throwing "--help" at things instead of "man" is a terrible habit (one that I used to have)
[18:53:09] <Earnest> I still have that bad habit, but I've replaced --help with tab-completion to see what it shows lol

[23:43:04] <emanuele6> wiscii: `!:' is valid, but it tries to call a command named `!:' (assuming history expansion is off)

[23:44:37] <emanuele6> if you want to negate a command, put a space after `!' e.g. `! cmd'
[23:44:52] <emanuele6> <wiscii > like `myfunc | :` but `myfunc | !:`
[23:44:55] <emanuele6> oh, you can't do that
[23:45:05] <emanuele6> `!' expects a pipeline after
[23:45:29] <emanuele6> you have to group your second command, i.e.:   cmd1 | { ! cmd2 ;}

[23:45:46] <wiscii> ahh, yes thanks .. ` ! :`
[23:45:49] <emanuele6> ( other than you put a space after `!'
[23:46:11] <emanuele6> if you want, `! :', you can just use `false'.
[23:46:23] <wiscii> i was so thick into the weeds i forgot completely that there are two commands
[23:46:32] <emanuele6> ( unless you are only using `!' to prevent `set -e' from exiting )
[23:46:51] <wiscii> no set -e for me ;-)
[23:46:59] <emanuele6> yay \o/
[23:49:32] <wiscii> i tried set -e and it did not work for me, as you might imagine.
[23:49:50] <wiscii> so i read about it on woolidge and decided .. no effing way do i want that
