[00:00:41] <cot> well, praising that "blunt advice"
[00:00:56] <imode> I don't see evidence of praise.

[00:01:12] <imode> ehh, nevermind, I can see that.

[00:06:33] <imode> wait...
[00:06:47] <imode> did I ban this dude from ##moshpit.
[00:07:14] <pushcx> A pattern I've seen over and over now is that someone sorta-deniably takes a poke at someone from a marginalized community - trans people, the poor, furries, etc - to test the waters. If they don't get strong pushback, in a few days or weeks they'll bring out the really ugly stuff, or just flame everybody.
[00:07:18] <goodger> he actually seemed vaguely familiar to me as well
[00:08:05] <pushcx> So like... someone posts "furries are silly" and then I look like a jerk if I ban them then, but it saves us a couple weeks of increasingly-sketchy stuff before they cross a really bright line.
[00:08:56] <imode> he popped in in august.
[00:09:14] <imode> talked coherently.
[00:09:16] <pushcx> But I've seen the pattern like 20 times in the last few years! So I try not to be trigger-happy but the trolls are kinda obvious after a while.
[00:10:16] <imode> I don't think you'll get complaints.

[02:43:15] <indigo> Yeah but Gemini is fighting adtech!!!
[02:43:16] <technomancy> it's 100% a shibolleth
[02:43:33] <drobilla> It'd be a better (attempt at) a movement to simply host .txt files on the web
[02:43:42] <meff[m]> yeah and then I can at least compress it
[02:43:42] <meff[m]> lol
[02:44:11] <meff[m]> like I was literally dealing with that on some remote bad-connectivity wifi the other day and the fact that I couldn't fetch compressed Gemtext suuucked
[02:45:58] <ignaloidas> http is probably the best general purpose transfer protocol we have ATM, like, why would you want to replace it?
[02:46:32] <meff[m]> yeah, framing, signaling, metadata, it's all there
[02:46:35] <goodger> because the WWW is such a tyre fire and people don't understand what HTTP does
[02:46:49] <meff[m]> and http 1.1 has been supported by millions of devices for decades
[02:46:52] <indigo> Also fighting adtech
[02:47:08] <ignaloidas> http 2.0 besides allowing the content to be compressed, also gives ways to compress the headers and stuff
[02:47:47] <meff[m]> I like http 2.0 for sure, but I'm just saying, for the "evergreen" folk that are rallying around Gemini, http 1.1 is pretty much as evergreen as it gets
[02:47:52] <meff[m]> pretty sure http 1.1 has outlasted filesystems
[02:48:00] <technomancy> goodger: who are these people who don't understand what HTTP does?

[02:49:18] <technomancy> I guess you can't get to the top of hacker news by writing a post about how you understand HTTP
[02:49:29] <meff[m]> well fun in the way of the article; fun the first few times then you realize you can't do much more with it and you stop using it
[02:49:36] <ngoldbaum> needs more http status dogs

[02:49:52] <meff[m]> ngoldbaum: what about teapots?
[02:49:56] <ignaloidas> ehh, it's fun to write a server when each request is isolated, it's a bit painful when you need to handle state between multiple clients
[02:50:01] <meff[m]> if only Gemini had a teapot status 😕
[02:50:15] <drobilla> That's the key IMO.  Just yet another project that's fun or whatever, but is mistaking itself for a real thing anyone does or ever will care about
[02:50:19] <meff[m]> ignaloidas: I mean it just becomes a standard web app then shrug
[02:50:34] <meff[m]> you have to have some sort of db, concurrency model, etc
[02:50:35] <drobilla> The whole thing is so glaringly based on "it was easy to implement, shittily"
[02:50:40] <meff[m]> that's not fun /s
[02:50:49] <ngoldbaum> meff[m]: at one point i wanted to use a neural network to randomly generate http status _____ where the blank is user suppliable and the training set is all the existing http status memes i could find
[02:50:56] <ngoldbaum> but alas i couldn’t be assed
[02:50:57] <meff[m]> I wrote some Gemini apps in the beginning and a lot of them used sqlite or redis

[02:52:24] <ignaloidas> capnproto is pretty cool besides the cursed portions of it's encoding
[02:52:34] <meff[m]> the test: what is the maximum level of intoxication at which I can implement the protocol
[02:52:41] <companion_cube> :D
[02:52:46] <ignaloidas> e.g. it uses three different types pointers IIRC
[02:53:15] <companion_cube> you mean, internally?
[02:53:18] <ignaloidas> or some, mildly weird ways to create a DOS exist
[02:53:21] <ignaloidas> companion_cube, yes
[02:53:26] <companion_cube> that's probably like flatbuffers, it's tough to provide in place decoding
[02:54:08] <ignaloidas> e.g. in capnproto a structure with default values will always be all zeroes, to help compression
[02:54:36] <ignaloidas> and also, you can ommit trailing zeros in a structure
[02:54:43] <mockturtle> The code worked differently when the moon was full [debugging] (calvin) https://lobste.rs/s/ixowaa
[02:55:11] <ignaloidas> so you can make a list of 10M elements filled with default data that takes up 100 bytes
[02:55:16] <companion_cube> :D
[02:55:27] <companion_cube> that's cool, didn't know that
[02:55:40] <companion_cube> the capabilities stuff seems super neat too, but probably too good for its time
[02:55:40] <meff[m]> oh god that reminds me of a school project where we were writing an OS and I wrote a malloc, but one of my partners kept `malloc(1)` ing

[03:08:15] <companion_cube> probably not stable
[03:08:20] <drobilla> Though to be fair, mostly only when you mix the two
[03:08:36] <drobilla> Normal web audio (i.e. in JS) is fine if you ignore 99% of the useless tinkertoy nonsense in it
[03:08:47] <companion_cube> ah maybe it's a js thing…
[03:09:05] <drobilla> companion_cube: You can explicitly share simple buffers easily enough (SharedArrayBuffer)
[03:09:50] <companion_cube> ✔
[03:09:59] <drobilla> companion_cube: If you want to share complex objects or malloced() things from emscripten and such though... I'm still not sure if it's even possible
[03:11:48] <drobilla> I can see why in a sense (it /is/ nicely and strictly separated, which is exactly right for DSP code), and one should expect frustration when treading beyond the bleeding edge like this... but it is oh so very frustrating

[09:04:38] <rtpg> Probably for the fun-ness factor right? I'm definitely interested in trying out stuff like Julia. Clojure is cool but when stuff breaks it's pretty unobvious what's going on tbh (tooling....)
[09:05:08] <rtpg> What is the "canonical" Scheme implementation that people use tho? cuz it's not Scheme but a bunch of stuff right?
[09:05:16] <amirouche> IDK Julia or Clojure. I was impressed by the recent post about clojure web framework tho.
[09:05:47] <amirouche> rtpg: I recommend chez scheme, fastest, most mature, but lacks libraries. Otherwise there is Guile..
[09:06:15] <rtpg> mature but lacking libraries, I suppose that means the built-in tooling is good but you're kind of on your own for a lot of stuff?
[09:07:57] <amirouche> re clojure web framework: it is called hyperfiddle (the github repo has a bibliography), lobster link: https://lobste.rs/s/mhdw2e/reactive_clojure_you_don_t_need_web

[09:08:11] <amirouche> (I do not like the title of the blog post tho)
[09:12:08] <amirouche> yes
[09:12:26] <amirouche> I am not sure I would say there is a lot of built-in tooling, but the REPL and debugger works nicely (except you need to get used to its tracebacks), there are built-in profiling tools, but only somekind of coverage is low-effort to use, timings profiling requires to write some code
[09:12:42] <amirouche> cpu / wall-clock time performance are very very impressive.

[09:15:29] <amirouche> error reporting could be better, but there is some (syntax errors are reported in a way that makes it easy to fix), some type errors are also reported with line information or fallback to char offset some time.
[09:18:08] <amirouche> There is also Racket, but I never used it. Racket's compiler was rebuilt on top of Chez. Racket has a lot of libraries, a package manager, and a big community (bigger than Guile)
[09:19:23] <amirouche> I did not use Racket because it was lacking POSIX Thread API. Racket re-invented concurrency / parallelism for some reason, and in general invented many things which makes it harder to dive in.
[09:20:12] <amirouche> Avoid DrRacket if you need a fast editor. The macro debugger in DrRacket is priceless when you do macro stuff (rare for me)

[16:41:28] <pushcx> I don't really know how to respond to having your browser set to pick dark themes and then being disgusted that you get a dark theme.
[16:41:34] <wink> pushcx: I honestly don't even know how that usually works. I did not willfully change anythign in a browser and the pages are still light mode by default
[16:41:38] <c355e3b> Push, do you want the comments directly on the PR?

[16:41:59] <cot> Neat
[16:42:16] <cot> ...but do fewer white pixels really conserve battery?

[16:43:47] <companion_cube> very empirically, my smartphone screen emits less light on dark screens (measured by using it as a kind of dim flashlight)
[16:43:59] <companion_cube> (walking into a dark room without waking up sleeping baby)
[16:44:44] <cot> But that's only because there are fewer white pixels, while the backlight is still at the same intensity? Or maybe I'm just missing something very obvious here
[16:45:57] <companion_cube> yeah possible! idk if energy consumption is constant for a given backlight or not
[16:46:46] <goodger> it depends on the display technology
[16:46:52] <cot> True that.
[16:47:00] <cot> Would be an interesting research project to measure this
[16:47:18] <wink> pushcx: I think my problem was with the author's phrasing of " usually when the operating system's UI is set to dark mode" which *might* only be true on platforms I don't use.
[16:47:50] <goodger> LCDs have constant backlight power and use fractionally more power when displaying darker colours, so on a standard display, 'dark mode' is going to increase power consumption
[16:48:15] <goodger> OLEDs don't use backlights and their power consumption relates directly to the amount of light they're emitting, so 'dark mode' will actually save a fair bit
[16:48:15] <companion_cube> what about phones?
[16:48:20] <companion_cube> ah!!
[16:48:24] <cot> Oh nice!

[17:20:34] <wink> but after a little research I might have been fooled by xfce.
[17:20:44] <wink> which looks like dark mode, but it's officially not.
[17:20:59] <wink> it's a dark theme and everything is dark, but no web page

[17:22:41] <banna> moony: every time I have ever touched typescript, type holes were everywhere. It's also annoying how scoping works with async functions depending on which javascript runtime you're targeting
[17:23:08] <rwb> i've never had scoping issues with async functions, what do you mean?
[17:23:16] <iDrougge> wink: Yes, I have my editor set to white on grey as well. I think both light and dark modes are extremes.
[17:23:39] <rwb> iDrougge: hope you have enough contrast on that, low contrast is a quick eye killer :^)
[17:23:52] <iDrougge> No, high contrast is.
[17:24:18] <iDrougge> I would have killed my eyes working on interlaced screens in the 90s if they weren't low-contrast.
[17:24:34] <moony> I await the day someone makes a theme that's the average of light and dark (read: "I can't read shit", the theme)
[17:24:44] <rwb> looking at a low contrast window for too long makes my eyes hurt honestly, so i've been going for higher and higher contrast
[17:24:50] <rwb> github's high contrast mode is very good
[17:25:05] <moony> Yea I've always leaned toward higher contrasts
[17:25:26] <moony> But that's partially because my eyes are already shit, may change now that I have glasses again
[17:25:32] <iDrougge> I have always had perfect eyesight.
[17:25:41] <shapr> I wish for software defined lenses somehow
[17:25:42] <banna> rwb: This is in reference to the async generated output for older versions of javascript vs. new versions that support the `async` keywords
[17:25:46] <shapr> is there such a thing?
[17:26:02] <rwb> banna: ah you mean the generator conversion?
[17:26:05] <banna> the typescript is the same, but the outputs are different enough that references break.
[17:26:15] <moony> Probably, in the form of a $50k brick
[17:26:17] <rwb> huh, never had that even with async-to-generator

[17:45:32] <banna> usually if you shoehorn a terminal on a eink display things don't work as nicely out of the box. you'll need a certain way of interacting with terminal programs that is a bit different than typical use cases
[17:45:49] <wink> banna: the problem I see is with latency. like, not jsut the SUPER slow thing, but just the single millisec diff where a popup for code completion canseem sluggish
[17:45:56] <ngoldbaum> wink: that analogy paraphrase just gave me a headache
[17:45:57] <gwozniak> I am sympathetic to the ideas behind Gemini. I think the execution is very misguided

[18:01:53] <c355e3b> yeah

[21:40:40] <ben> yeah, it had a transparent bg
[21:41:05] <ben> we noticed it first on tilde.news since we rewrote the base theme
[21:41:09] <kline> i didnt even realise lobsters used qr codes
[21:41:14] <ben> just for 2fa
[21:41:23] <kline> seen
[21:41:24] <kline> thanks
[21:41:29] <rwb> i should implement TOTP
[21:41:31] <ben> mm i should rebase again
[21:41:35] <rwb> looks like a fun little project
[21:41:35] <moony> tilde.news has kinda bleh contrast, which is unfortunate
[21:41:45] <ben> i might just ditch our custom theme
[21:41:54] <ben> now that upstream has dark mode :)
[21:42:14] <rwb> oh yeah that makes me think
[21:42:24] <rwb> how does one, as a long-lived fork, keep pulling changes from upstream?
[21:42:32] <rwb> constantly rebasing wouldn't work, right?
[21:42:34] <ben> git pull -r upstream master
[21:42:38] <ben> git push -f
[21:42:47] <ben> for this it's fine since no one's contributing to the fork
[21:42:50] <rwb> what if multiple people want to work on the fork, however?
[21:42:54] <gwozniak> constant merging is required, unless you want a lot of work
[21:42:54] <rwb> yeah i was about to ask :^)\
[21:43:04] <ben> can be messy for sure
[21:43:05] <ngoldbaum> forgot to “git commit -am ‘yolo’”
[21:44:28] <pushcx> I usually maintain the upstream master/main/whatever branch as a branch named 'upstream' and merge from it into local master occasoinally.

[21:45:26] <kline> some projects maintain their stuff as a stack of patches

[21:51:39] <pushcx> cot: I wonder if your browser isn't doing the css variables.
[21:51:44] <cot> But then again, NetSurf's CSS support isn't great so it's probably just the stylesheet using CSS directive NetSurf doesn't support

[21:56:08] <technomancy> when I played TIS-100 my primary complaint with the game was that it used some fake ncurses thing instead of actually running in a terminal

[21:58:58] <pushcx> I don't think it's fair to put the word 'just' in front of taking a dep on several hundred thousand lines of code (probably many times over - how many terminals run cross-platform?)
[21:59:25] <technomancy> compared to the overhead of unity tho?
[22:00:27] <cot> I think dealing with unity would be easier than dealing with random terminal/ncurses quirks (the whole thing is nonstandardized, right?)
[22:00:47] <ngoldbaum> unity makes zach’s life easier by doing all the messy cross-platform bits for him
[22:00:48] <cot> Not to mention that Windows got their PTY api only recently
[22:01:02] <technomancy> there are nonstandard elements if you want like ... more than 8 colors but none of the features that TIS uses care about that stuff
[22:01:04] <ignaloidas> game engines are made for things to be easy to do, and making a (bad for general purpose) fake terminal in a game engine is actually quite easy
[22:01:47] <ignaloidas> you don't need a full terminal emulator for TIS-100 so why concern yourself with that
[22:01:50] <technomancy> ignaloidas: I agree in general for gamedev
[22:01:57] <pushcx> weird bit of history that zachtronics allllmost invented minecraft
[22:01:58] <technomancy> but TIS-100 is literally all about doing things the hard way
[22:02:20] <technomancy> if you're going to make a game like that you should fully commit to the bit, is what I mean
[22:02:25] <ignaloidas> technomancy, doesn't mean that the dev has to do it too while making a game
[22:02:40] <ignaloidas> if my game was all about killing people, should I fully commit to it?
[22:02:57] <cot> Anyway, why does it matter if it's ncurses or an emulated terminal?
[22:03:12] <technomancy> you could play it over SSH!
[22:03:12] <ignaloidas> can't play without running a window manager?
[22:03:33] <cot> Interesting, true
[22:03:37] <technomancy> it's like if you were going to play zork and it was like "hang on your GPU isn't good enough"
[22:03:45] <technomancy> that's ridiculous
[22:07:03] <ngoldbaum> you say that but apparently the zork anthology on steam needs directx 7 :p

[22:48:55] <imode> oh sweet, dark mode. how do I enable it.
[22:49:14] <moony> either make your browser force it, or have your OS set to dark mode
[22:49:20] <imode> I'm on arch.
[22:49:34] <imode> there isn't a button to do it anywhere? why are we relying on the OS to do it.

[22:50:54] <drobilla> imode: Excellent question ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:51:03] <moony> for most people, it being just OS-level config is nice
[22:51:07] <moony> means not having to hunt down a button
[22:51:20] <drobilla> imode: It seems their idea is that browsers should just follow the OS setting or something.  A button or at least extension to add one will surely come if it hasn't already
[22:51:22] <imode> granted! but for the rest of us, who maybe don't have a global pref. set..
[22:51:24] <southclaws> yeah I like the OS wide dark mode
[22:51:26] <moony> (i.e. for me, where everything is dark mode on the virtue of the fact I flipped a switch in my global settings)
[22:51:40] <kline> drobilla, thays great but i dont have that option

[22:52:01] <imode> I don't have the "set OS to dark mode" option.
[22:52:08] <kline> drobilla, my environment doesnt implement whatever protocol chrome uses for darkmode
[22:52:12] <kline> so i just moved to firefox
[22:52:49] <drobilla> In practice I just use DarkReader which works pretty well for most things.  I just know this from testing
[22:52:53] <imode> I've been using Stylish. maybe there's an addon per-site for firefox or something.
[22:52:59] <imode> or rather, Stylus.
[22:53:00] <kline> this turned out to be pretty good because firefox has so far stripped away less customisability features and settings that chrome
[22:53:10] <kline> but thats only because theyre slow, not because they dont believe in it

[22:53:36] *** Joins: vv (~vv@188.163.102.165)

[23:51:36] <iDrougge> imode: It stands to reason that if you have set your browser to dark mode, you want pages to respect that.

[23:53:13] <imode> iDrougge: but if I want some sites to be light and others to be dark..
[23:53:23] <imode> or I want to toggle a specific site.

[23:54:24] <iDrougge> imode: I'm sure there's a browser feature for that.
[23:55:06] <iDrougge> The problem with web technology is that it doesn't respect user settings.
[23:55:08] <imode> there isn't. :\
[23:55:11] <drobilla> ^
[23:55:34] <iDrougge> Instead, I have to, in vain, try to find the setting to set the time format in Firebase's console.
[23:55:49] <pushcx> The browser is your User Agent. If it's not acting on your behalf, I dunno, it had one job. Get an extension or a different agent or something.
[23:56:01] <drobilla> When I first learned about dark mode I thought that was nice progress, so I implemented it and showed it around and... got bikeshed feedback about *how* dark is appropriate (e.g. me on OLED chose true black)
[23:56:03] <drobilla> siiiiiiigh
[23:56:32] <pushcx> drobilla: that's getting rehashed in our comment thread, yeah
[23:56:35] <drobilla> Better than nothing I guess
[23:56:55] <iDrougge> I don't know; to me, it feels like a gift to the people who use green text on black in their editors.

[23:57:21] <varjag> "We had teams internally that were making the same thing but had no idea each other existed - and this happened pretty frequently."
[23:57:33] <varjag> but microservices made the duplication more efficient!
[23:57:43] <imode> I like dark mode! I just wanna be able to turn it on and off when the sun decides to shine on my poor pasty ass.
[23:57:55] <iDrougge> imode: Doesn't your OS do that?
[23:58:14] <imode> nnnno?
[23:58:28] <imode> I run Arch, there's no "universal theme protocol".
[23:58:37] <iDrougge> I have a daylight-sensitive desktop background. It looks very comforting when I start work and there is a sunrise above the cliffs in the landscape.
[23:58:45] <iDrougge> You forgot the "BTW".
[23:58:48] <imode> lmfaoooo.

[23:59:18] <imode> well, I don't come equipped with a light sensor. I run a refurbished Thinkpad T430.
[23:59:46] <iDrougge> varjag: We had a brainstorming session for a hackathon at work this week. In one corner of the mindmap board, there were slots for technologies. Someone wrote "microservices".
[23:59:48] <cot> Why is a light sensor necessary? time() + knowledge of sunrise/sunset times should be enough.
