[00:05:24] <FromGitter> <mcp292> You mean `( ESC A`
[00:05:28] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> nope
[00:05:31] <FromGitter> <mcp292> or
[00:05:33] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I used evil mode
[00:05:52] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> First you are in insert state and press (
[00:06:00] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it inserted both ( and )
[00:06:05] <FromGitter> <mcp292> `( ESC l a this` or `( ESC l l this`
[00:06:13] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> then you just keep typing "this"
[00:06:18] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> no need to press ESC
[00:06:57] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I don't know why you need ESC A
[00:06:59] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Yea you were right the first time, because how else would you get over the inserted `)` unless you just type it again
[00:07:29] <FromGitter> <mcp292> because it inserts `)` after the cursor
[00:07:41] <FromGitter> <mcp292> the cursor is left between `(|)`
[00:09:29] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> ESC to go to normal state, l to move cursor forward, i to go to normal state
[00:10:07] <FromGitter> <mcp292> exactly
[00:10:49] <FromGitter> <mcp292> so that makes your strokes: `( ESC l i`. But, when you `ESC` the cursor moves back. So it's really `( ESC ll i`
[00:11:40] <FromGitter> <mcp292> which can be shortened to `( ESC A`, which is more work than `( ) SPC`
[00:11:58] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> okay that's right
[00:12:09] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but it really doesn't bother me much
[00:13:21] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> in most cases I don't need to press ( in the first case
[00:13:31] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> 1) place
[00:13:54] <FromGitter> <mcp292> really? how so?
[00:14:08] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> first, there's tab completion and LSP
[00:14:30] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Oh, yea I use neither. I like to type uninterrupted, and save my pinky along the way
[00:14:37] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> second, you don't need lots of parentheses in some functional language. and in LISP you have parinfer
[00:14:51] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> just stop writing C and C++
[00:15:22] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Write Rust and save yourself
[00:15:38] <FromGitter> <mcp292> You're being unrealistic. I get paid to program for a living.
[00:15:52] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Rust has parenthesis too.
[00:16:12] <FromGitter> <mcp292> You mention lisp and then say avoid parens by avoiding C lolololo
[00:16:40] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Rust LSP is the best across all languages lsp-mode currently supports
[00:17:23] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> and the second most downloaded extension on vscode
[00:17:48] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Yes avoid C. That's my suggestion.
[00:18:05] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I give you that for both rust and lisp, but I use neither and won't. Typing parenthesis is not the real issue though. It's the "code blocks" that takes a bunch of strokes, which is why I had it bound to a keychord in emacs
[00:18:08] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Although I like C, but it has bad editing experience.
[00:18:38] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> If you have smartparens, you don't need to bother with {}
[00:19:13] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I'm glad you like it, and I am open to Rust, but no one has convinced me how it would be better than C and Python. But again, for me it's all what you call "horrible" lol!
[00:19:24] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> That's my original suggestion
[00:19:26] <FromGitter> <mcp292> because I never use autocomplete or LSP or anything like that
[00:19:45] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Then suck it up.
[00:19:58] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Wow you are really failing to see the point here
[00:20:43] <FromGitter> <mcp292> You do bother with {} in smartparens. Try it when you get back to a computer. It's the same issue as we discussed with `(` expect worse because of newlines
[00:21:44] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I don't bother with {} in smartparens...
[00:22:14] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> because rust LSP takes care of that as well
[00:22:14] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I don't think it's smart parens doing that then. It must be one of your autocomplete settings
[00:22:24] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Exactly my point...
[00:22:54] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that's why I suggested you to switch a language just for the sake of editing experience
[00:23:06] <FromGitter> <mcp292> i'm taking your actual answer to my actual question to be "I don't know"
[00:23:13] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I know and that's hilarious!
[00:23:29] <FromGitter> <mcp292> The only time that actually works is if someone is on windows
[00:23:41] <FromGitter> <mcp292> then the only solution can be one that starts with install linux
[00:24:22] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I shall remind everyone about the famous quote by me ‚èé  ‚èé > Nothing is difficult as long as you give up.
[00:24:39] <FromGitter> <mcp292> If you pitched my to rewrite the team's code in Rust because "the editing experience" I'd then tell you to suck it up
[00:24:44] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> If the editing experience really sucks, just give up.
[00:25:15] <FromGitter> <mcp292> lolololol
[00:25:17] <FromGitter> <mcp292> wow!
[00:25:28] <FromGitter> <mcp292> man you are something but I appreciate the humor
[00:26:33] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> there are several forms of giving up.
[00:26:42] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you can switch the language or switch the tool

[00:30:23] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> That's hardly complete
[00:30:41] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> first you misunderstood what kbd is doing, which I already pointed out
[00:31:18] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> second you've no idea of interactive form, or put it in another way, the difference between a function and a command in Emacs terminology
[00:31:48] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Third as I mentioned yesterday, you should use prefix "o" for user defined key bindings
[00:32:23] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Given your level of familiarity with Emacs and ELisp, I suggested two packages but you refused
[00:32:41] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Should I be more assertive next time?
[00:32:50] <FromGitter> <mcp292> No you should simply move out of the way
[00:59:29] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I needed to replace the `ESC` with `<escape>`
[00:59:54] <FromGitter> <mcp292> (spacemacs/set-leader-keys "ic" (kbd "o { RET } <escape> O"))
[01:01:25] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Now I need to "name" this or get it to work within a named function
