[00:06:04] <ITD4004> and here's an improved version of my ADPCM encoder
[00:06:07] <ITD4004> https://bpa.st/KP2HIELDM7GDSPLVEAS4G5RAJ4
[00:06:27] <ITD4004> including a decoder that doesn't generate an easily-playable file
[00:06:27] <ITD4004> https://bpa.st/SJR2LQLA4ZP4Q535C234TR7JIA
[00:07:47] <eyynet4> thats the really low bitrate one that only encodes delta values so uses way less bits?
[00:08:01] <beaky> nice i like delta encoding
[00:08:22] <ITD4004> eyynet4: i don't really understand your question
[00:08:27] <ITD4004> beaky: thanks
[00:09:17] <ITD4004> all of the code you're seeing here is based on DVI IMA ADPCM spec that's floating around the internet for years

[00:13:16] <ITD4004> it generated files that the decoder file put out as terribad to listen to

[01:13:23] <micrex22> beaky: well the font I'm using on linux isn't technically a bitmap font, but it has extra data that makes it sharp at certain sizes

[07:18:41] <blahboybaz> Am I ascertaiing this correctly?.. In a linked list - I can not use size (size of list) in any logic to navigate the list because two numbers both represent the same position? Namely size 0, while it may mean the list is empty, represents the head of the list; and, size 1, while it may represent there being one node in the list, also represents the head of the list.
[07:18:54] <blahboybaz> Am I understanding that right?
[07:19:03] <arahael> blahboybaz: How are you calculating size?
[07:19:29] <blahboybaz> arahael: when a node is created, size++, when a node is deleted, size--

[07:21:42] <vdamewood> blahboybaz: It might help if you specify which language you're working with.
[07:22:02] <blahboybaz> vdamewood: javascript
[07:22:16] <vdamewood> Ah, yes. JavaScript 'classes'.
[07:22:47] <blahboybaz> There are 2 classes a Node class. And a List class. The list class (composes) the node class. I don't think it composes it exactly but it uses it
[07:22:53] <blahboybaz> no inheritance
[07:24:06] <vdamewood> So, then the List class would have the size value, and it should be zero if there are no nodes yet.
[07:24:16] <vdamewood> Then once there is a node, then size would be 1.

[07:39:23] <vdamewood> blahboybaz: On line 115, why do you check index == 0?
[07:39:26] <blahboybaz> arahael: Well I've done various tests. Iirc when I cerate a list at initialzation of the object things seem to work fine (I would have to verify that). But if I try to work with nodes later (initialize with an empty list then add / remove nodes later) then stuff goes haywire
[07:41:21] <blahboybaz> When I wrote the code I thought that index = 0 means you are at the head of the lst (empty or not is a separate issue). So I check to see if you are at the head of the list && if there is a node there or not
[07:41:30] <vdamewood> Same with line 102.
[07:42:18] <arahael> blahboybaz: What do you mean by "work with nodes later" - you mean, bypass your List class?
[07:42:20] <vdamewood> But index is user input, you shouldn't asume it has anything to do with the structure of your class.
[07:42:40] <blahboybaz> yes 115 and 102 that was my logic to check position and whether the list was empty or not but now I'm not so sure that's right. Just maybe not right for a deeper reason than what it might seem
[07:43:01] <vdamewood> Also, if you check for index == 0, and node is instanceof Node, then you ignore the case where index !=0, but node is still not an instance of Node.
[07:43:35] <vdamewood> So, if you try to do something to index 4 of a 4-element list, you've just tried to set null's data, which it doesn't have.
[07:43:36] <arahael> Too many sources of truth. :(
[07:43:37] <blahboybaz> arahael: There are 2 ways to create a list. You can either create a list when you initialize the list object or you can initialize the list object with no list items and add / remove them later (after initialization)

[08:29:39] <beaky> yes i think it is not turing complete because if they were turing complete then you'd have proofs that the turing machine halts for some problems but this would be impossible under rice's theorem i think so ex falso quolibet

[10:23:38] <Izem> let me see if I can draw something in text

[12:52:44] <pikapika> There will be no need to repeat the variable names, the dict is written down with the values directly
[12:53:14] <Daemonick> IMHO, these hard links update the original copy
[12:53:27] <pyzozord> Oh sorry I meant "symbolic" when I wrote "soft".
[12:53:57] <Daemonick> my mistake, original prototype is also change if you change something to its copy
[12:54:17] <Daemonick> I am right?
[12:54:26] <pikapika> pyzozord, symlink is just a dumb string
[12:54:40] <pikapika> Therein lies its good and its bad
[12:55:24] <Daemonick> and what is the ugly?
[12:56:17] <pikapika> The good is that its just a string, and the target could change from say a file to a directory to a mount point etc and nothing would need to be updated
[12:56:29] <pikapika> The bad is that if the target path changes, the symlink becomes invalid
[12:57:10] <pikapika> I don't know enough about hardlinks to say if it has complementary features or not

[14:08:02] <arahael> pyzozord: Here's how you can create a hard link to an empty file in unix: touch theEmptyFile
[14:08:04] <piou> pyzozord: every file has at least one hardlink: it's just the association between the path of a file and its inode on the filesystem
[14:08:06] <arahael> pyzozord: That's literally it.
[14:08:14] <piou> pyzozord: I think the difference is best seen if you delete the original target. Let's say we have a target T and H a hardlink to T as well as S a symbolic link to T. If you change the content of T and read H or S you'll see the new content. If you delete T, S is broken, you can read the content anymore. But H still contains the content because H is T.

[14:08:32] <pyzozord> oooh I get it
[14:09:11] <piou> pyzozord: another difference is that since hardlinks are so strongly related to a filesystem you can't hardlink to a file on another filesystem. You need a symbolic link to that, because a symbolic link is an association between a path (the symbolic link path) an another (the target's path)

[14:10:02] <pyzozord> soft link is a new file that has a path to it's target, the linkage is kind of "logical". Hard link is another entry in the filesystem but it using the same filesystem data blocks (inodes) as the original, the linkage is "physical"?

[15:20:05] <mathAndRhetorics> so it's possible to code a lock-free queue that much faster than the regular ArrayBlockingQueue.
[15:20:13] <pulse> best approach is always a combination of theoretical knowledge and experience
[15:20:15] <beaky> yes you need theory to give a direction to drive the 'iteration' towards in the first place
[15:21:03] <mathAndRhetorics> in game development, you probably know testing for odd and even numbers can be with % or with &. The latter being much faster. Same goes about division by 2 vs >>, and so on. These are some basic concepts that are not theory, they are practice.
[15:21:22] <pulse> compilers have been optimizing that since late 90s mathAndRhetorics

[15:22:41] <pulse> mathAndRhetorics, perf tuning is a multidimensional problem and there's no single solution to it. the endpoint is always the same though, you benchmark and see if your assumptions are correct
[15:22:48] <pulse> (pro tip: your assumptions are almost never correct)
[15:22:49] <mathAndRhetorics> compilers don't transpore mutual exclusion locks into compare and swap instructions with sequencing
[15:22:55] <mathAndRhetorics> * transpose
[15:23:12] <mathAndRhetorics> pulse pro tip, your own assumptions are almost never correct. Have you tried all compilers on all platforms for all languages?
[15:23:18] <nitrix> As a rule of thumb, if you have a clever optimization that isn't about algorithmic complexity, it's pretty much guaranteed that compiler writers know about it and have considered implemented it by now. GCC is like 30 years now.
[15:23:30] <mathAndRhetorics> not true
[15:23:57] <mathAndRhetorics> which compiler transposes mutual exclusion locks into the compare and swap CPU instruction with sequencing?
[15:23:58] <pulse> yeah, that's why you don't write asm anymore. a C compiler will outwit you every single time
[15:24:10] <mathAndRhetorics> no, it won't
[15:24:35] <mathAndRhetorics> I just gave you an example above of CAS where a compiler won't outwit you
[15:25:10] <mathAndRhetorics> have you tried all possible cases of optimizing code and seeing if the compiler has outwitted you?
[15:25:23] <nitrix> Actually, memory barriers and instruction re-ordering is one of the area that a human is guaranteed to get it more wrong than compiler heuristics.
[15:25:31] <mathAndRhetorics> CAS is a big deal because locking is so slow
[15:26:30] <novns> mathAndRhetorics, ok, we will use compilers, and you can write machine code directly
[15:26:35] * vdamewood names his new compiler Rashamon

[15:27:27] <mathAndRhetorics> Another example: if two variables are in the same cache line, and they are written to by different threads, then they present the same problems of write contention as if they were a single variable. This is a concept know as “false sharing”. For high performance then, it is important to ensure that independent, but concurrently written, variables do not share the same cache-line if contention is to be
[15:27:27] <mathAndRhetorics> minimised.
[15:27:35] <vdamewood> Oh, oops. I forgot how it was spelled.
[15:27:51] <mathAndRhetorics> I'm not speaking of coding in assembly. I'm speaking of coding in Java
[15:27:59] <beaky> yes autovectorization is another area where compiler optimizations are still lagging behind more manual approaches like simd intrinsics

[17:11:37] <olive__> i've seen that phonology can be quite difficult to learn. experiments show that we lose the ability to recognise certain sounds as we grow up. by the time we are adult, we retain the ability to recognise only the sounds present in the languages we speak.

[17:30:37] <olive__> vdamewood: it's because Arabic is a Semitic language with very different phonology compared to Persian, Turkish and Urdu.
[17:30:40] <vdamewood> olive__: You're right about that. Persian is hard as fubar to read, but Arabic is much easier to 'guess' whet missing vowels are and such.
[17:31:08] <vdamewood> If I see a word that's a cluster of three letters, it's probably CaCC.
[17:31:18] <olive__> vdamewood: it's not about the missing vowels. if you know Persian, you can guess the vowels alright. it's the consonants.

[17:33:35] <vdamewood> olive__: And I can assure you, when I'm reading Persian, if I don't know the word already, I can't guess what the vowels are when they're not written.

[17:37:35] <olive__> vdamewood: there is a one to one mapping from the spelling (with diacritics) to pronunciation. but if you encounter the word in speaking, it's difficult to find which consonant symbol is being pronounced because there can be many to one mapping.

[18:13:22] <piou> olive__: I realize that, what I mean is that if they're of pictographic "descent" then you can still build an ethymology in many cases just as we do with our latin or greek roots etc. Just because a symbol isn't directly a representation of something doesn't mean that there's no information passed through pictoral means.

[18:14:22] <piou> olive__: my point wasn't that all chinese characters are mere pictures of what they represent, but rather than because there is this strong pictoral influence the idea that chinese was created to be hard to read is baloney

[18:35:05] <olive_> vdamewood: yes.
[18:35:06] <user51> thing is, there's a paradox
[18:35:15] <Quietwalker> Just last week I had to talk to one of my developers, super smart guy, excellent coder.  Had to tell him to remove 2 layers of abstraction and dumb it down so a new dev can still follow the code.
[18:35:18] <bxtn> "that's the fun part. you never do get to it."
[18:35:23] <user51> when i started i didnt know what a stack, queue, tree, whatever actually is
[18:35:35] <Quietwalker> bxtn: just because it's in the backlog doesn't mean anyone will work on it.  Business needs dictate priority. :)
[18:35:49] <Quietwalker> bxtn: Though in my team, I advocate for a certain percentage of tech debt/refactor tickets per sprint.
[18:35:52] <bxtn> exactly. that's what we're for. business value in some shape or form.
[18:35:53] <user51> so you could misappply the quote by saying "you don't need this and that"
[18:36:16] <bxtn> what we make is means to an end.
[18:36:39] <user51> basically, you need experience to know where something is going, but experience kinda ends up being paradoxic
[18:36:41] <bxtn> a tool. a procedure. unix idealists kind of miss that because they mostly do their coding as a hobby.
[18:36:44] <user51> at least for me
[18:36:44] <Quietwalker> bxtn: Yep. Every professional (as in, paid for the work) programmer's first job is to make more value - usually money - for the company than they cost, preferably the most money possible.
[18:36:59] <olive_> i feel the corporate coding environment is responsible for a lot of code which is ugly and unmaintainable. corporate envrionments encourages spaghetti code by using languages and coding practices which ensure nobody could do a lot of damage.
[18:37:13] <Quietwalker> it's not to write perfect, or even good code.  Many a company thrived on code that was first to the market, even if it was crap.
[18:37:53] <bxtn> olive_: corporate environment doesn't encourage good practices a lot.
[18:37:57] <bxtn> like standup meetings that have...
[18:38:00] <Quietwalker> olive_: Hmm.  I think that there's still a lot of work to be done in the field of software engineering at an architecture/corporate level.

[18:38:06] <olive_> all the unnecessary layers of abstractions serve that purpose too.

[18:38:25] <olive_> Quietwalker: i don't think so.
[18:38:50] <Quietwalker> I've worked for IBM, and even they're pretty disparate ,even for being one of the more organized development environments I've seen.

[18:40:01] <olive_> Quietwalker: the whole object-oriented hype was a result of the corporate coding practices. coders had been writing fine code without classes and still do. it's the companies that want to put cubicles in the code too.
[18:40:03] <Quietwalker> and because of that, if there was a global style change necessary by the team responsible for that, they just pushed it out, and it worked magically, everywhere.

[18:43:57] <bxtn> Quietwalker: "code ninjas" and "rockstar programmers" are still desirable. they just go by the term "10X developer".
[18:44:11] <Quietwalker> as no one can maintain it but the original author, who believes so strongly in the superiority and obviousness of their code that no documentation is needed.  It's basically like visiting #python.
[18:44:13] <Quietwalker> XD
[18:44:55] <bxtn> lol. the "no documentation needed" ding-dongs is what's shaping me up into the guy going back and trying to add javadoc comments and update our onboarding wiki.
[18:45:05] <Quietwalker> arahael: Yep. Usually it's team level, rather than org or company level.
[18:45:24] <olive_> Quietwalker: if you treat the coders in the office like working in a mill, C++ or Python is a good choice for you. make all the classes you want and never let one developer go beyond the confines of his little playground. but i suppose it does become necessary as many developers in cubicles are not well-trained anyway in programming in general.

[18:46:37] <arahael> mobidrop: And it also stops people from trying to be too clever by half.
[18:46:38] <bxtn> instead of go, consider crystal-lang.
[18:46:39] <olive_> as far as the patterns are concerned, Norvig et. al. has already shown that they are only a residue of inadequate language constructs, not some classical technique one needs to learn.
[18:46:45] <gggp> what code is clean code ,hah
[18:47:02] <olive_> bxtn: i intend to.
[18:47:03] <Quietwalker> again, microservices are a way to reduce complexity through common constructs.  Specifically, microservices provide a way to escape access and cache invalidation issues when multiple consumers need access to the same set of data.
[18:47:09] <olive_> bxtn: it's compiled, right?
[18:47:12] <mobidrop> arahael, yes nothing worse than "clever" python code
[18:47:13] <bxtn> yep. compiled.
[18:47:25] <olive_> bxtn: i like the Ruby-inspired syntax.
[18:47:41] <bxtn> ruby's an excellent language. it's the dang loosey-goosey type system that gets my goat.
[18:47:46] <olive_> bxtn: Go forces some formatting on me. i don't like that. also, the concurrency model is too complicated for me.
[18:48:06] <olive_> bxtn: Crystal is strongly typed.
[18:48:07] <bxtn> if i had a nickel for every ticket i saw for "method not found for NilClass" on jira, i could probably retire early.
[18:48:24] <arahael> olive_: I *love* that Go forces formatting.
[18:48:24] <Quietwalker> gggp: I don't agree with everything in the book, at least not to the level they take it, but they do at least present some arguments for writing your code in a certain way that makes them far, far easier to maintain, especially when you're trying to focus on agile/mvp development.
[18:48:29] <bxtn> olive_: exactly. though it also tries to infer types when you compile so you may accidentally footgun yourself.
[18:48:33] <arahael> olive_: I'm so sick and tired of developers arguing about code style.
[18:48:43] <olive_> arahael: it's your choice. i like to format the way i want in my code.
[18:48:52] <bxtn> code style should be a team/project/organization decree, not some dang language's holy text.
[18:48:57] <arahael> olive_: At work? It's never my choice.
[18:48:59] <gggp> :)
[18:49:04] <olive_> arahael: arguments about code choice could be ended by just agreeing on some style.
[18:49:12] <arahael> bxtn: It's actually quite nice when everything is consistent.
[18:49:16] <olive_> arahael: that style may differ from the `gofmt` style.
[18:49:21] <Quietwalker> bxtn: Agreed. I dislike python primarily because it's not whitespace agnostic.
[18:49:32] <arahael> olive_: It takes so much debate to finally eventually agree.
[18:49:44] <arahael> olive_: People are *passionate* about code style.
[18:49:54] <Quietwalker> actually, in general, I also dislike strongly opinionated frameworks.

[18:50:14] <olive_> arahael: if i'm contributing to someone's codebase, i would stick to their guidelines.
[18:50:31] <olive_> arahael: but it should be *their* guidelines.
[18:50:36] <Quietwalker> in my experience, it's an 80/20 problem.  80% of the time, you do what the framework designer expects, and 20% of the time you have to violate those assumptions and certain frameworks make it hard or impossible

[19:06:58] <olive_> bxtn: the Actor Model is much more intuitive to me than the style used in Go.
[19:07:08] <olive_> bxtn: you can try it too.
[19:07:51] <bxtn> that reminds me, even ruby has ractor now so that's nice.
[19:08:11] <olive_> bxtn: have you coded in Crystal?
[19:08:16] <bxtn> yeah.
[19:08:21] <bxtn> done a few projects in it before.
[19:08:32] <olive_> bxtn: how is the experience?
[19:08:47] <Thedarkb-Desktop> In my latest C game engine attempt/waste of time, I've put in a message passing system between entities which don't share state
[19:08:52] <bxtn> nice. the static typing makes things more obvious. the main thing to get is that it is NOT ruby, despite appearances.
[19:09:03] <olive_> Thedarkb-Desktop: i don't think it's ever a waste of time.
[19:09:20] <olive_> bxtn: just like Elixir is not Ruby, LOL
[19:09:38] <bxtn> crystal looks even closer to ruby than elixir does.
[19:09:39] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I suppose there's always the element of "Let's learn from the last failed project."
[19:10:30] <olive_> Thedarkb-Desktop: yeah.

[19:12:51] <olive_> bxtn: writing a parser is not an easy task, though. parsing is one of the difficult steps of compiling.
[19:13:13] <olive_> especially if you're working with Perl, LOL
[19:13:15] <bxtn> guess like how much of it's just a program that generates source code instead of actually working as part of the steps.
[19:13:38] <bxtn> writing for correct data is easy. it's the handling of incorrect stuff.
[19:13:45] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I remember staying up until like 4AM trying to wrap my head around recursive descent with no luck.
[19:14:15] <olive_> Thedarkb-Desktop: if one wants to write a recursive descent parser, Parsec is best game in town.
[19:14:37] <olive_> Thedarkb-Desktop: but Raku has some constructs which are a part of the language itself.

[23:56:32] <user51> for a long time i did not use lots of useful vim features, fro example
[23:56:57] <user51> i think that once i'm done with this parser generator, i'll might start reading about operating systems
[23:57:25] <user51> so, the font is REALLY good, but also feels.. filtered?
[23:58:06] <user51> it feels like it ran through hqx or a similar algorithm
[23:58:34] <user51> GeDaMo: wouldn't that be better solved by hardware rather than software?
[23:58:50] <Izem> the file as the atom of the operating system is a great idea
