[20:47:04] <theseb> What is the #1 value add that python Jupyter notebooks deliver?  There is something weird about notebooks I can't quite put my finger on it.  One weird thing is a notebook lets you run PIECES of your program.  I'm not sure any Python editor makes it easy to run just a few highlighted sections of code.  At least I've never seen that.  So that IS one odd thing notebooks do
[20:47:12] <theseb> is that the main reason people like them?
[20:47:38] <theseb> Well plus you can bundle the output together with the source?
[20:47:41] <mefistofeles> theseb: that's one of its perks, sure
[20:48:04] <mefistofeles> many scientific computing is exploratory, the workflow is running pieces of code over and over again just changing a few characters, parameters or lines
[20:48:21] *** Joins: yauhsien (~Yau-Hsien@61-231-56-96.dynamic-ip.hinet.net)
[20:48:24] <mefistofeles> not having to run the whole thing every time you want to change something can be achieved with the notebook interface
[20:49:08] <mefistofeles> but I'd say its main advantage these days is that you get a more interactive computing environment. You get markdown/html, figures, widgets, etc... in the same notebook document
[20:49:36] *** Joins: blei (~blei@user/blei)
[20:49:38] <mefistofeles> and you can use many different kernels or programming languages using the same interface
[20:50:07] <theseb> mefistofeles: isn't it odd that programming editors don't let you run pieces of your program?
[20:50:19] <theseb> mefistofeles: it is like somehow only notebooks figured out that is useful
[20:50:31] <mefistofeles> theseb: some can
[20:50:37] <mefistofeles> but it's not the common thing, that's true
[21:06:05] <hodapp> quite a lot of programming editors can, but it's really not that odd when ones can't
[21:07:00] <hodapp> most editors are concerned with the source code itself, not with the execution environment nor with the state of some session in some interpreter
[21:08:32] <hodapp> but most of my use of notebooks is: when I'm doing prototypes or something exploratory, and I am generating frequent enough results (especially things like plots) that it is much easier to keep right alongside the code that produced them
[21:08:39] <hodapp> which I'd otherwise have to be manually managing
[21:09:23] <hodapp> my other main use is in writing executable documentation (or, literate programming)
[21:09:42] <mefistofeles> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2RlMdmv1p25Xy5thJUhkKGvjtV-dkAIsUXP-AL4ffI/edit#slide=id.g362da58057_0_1 there's always this one as well

[21:09:50] <mefistofeles> kinda outdated, but some points still stand
[21:10:39] *** Quits: tomeaton17 (~tomeaton1@92.234.2.175) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:10:44] <hodapp> in both cases, a lot of its usefulness comes from the interactivity combined with it bundling all the outputs together to something that can be more generally read (or even interacted with, in the case of some widgets that one can embed in a notebook) without requiring the development environment
[21:10:53] <hodapp> but doing "actual" development in a notebook is a royal pain
[21:12:39] <stefan-_> hodapp, what editors allow to run pieces of code?
[21:13:18] <hodapp> stefan-_: consider something like MATLAB; or, all the devs here use Pycharm; or, in Emacs I can do it even with built-in tools in Python
[21:13:25] <hodapp> pretty sure VSCode will do it with pretty basic plugins
[21:15:48] <stefan-_> i would consider matlab more in the "notebook" spectrum
[21:15:56] <stefan-_> using intellij here currently for python development, should be quite similar to pycharm
[21:16:20] <stefan-_> i know that intellij shows the plots in a sidebar
[21:16:27] <stefan-_> when you run a python program
[21:16:30] <stefan-_> which is quite cool
[21:16:48] <mefistofeles> I use pycharm, but I think you don't get that with the community edition (free)
[21:17:16] <HuntsMan> theseb: great question, I ask that myself since I don't regularly use notebooks, only sometimes when doing data analysis
[21:17:51] <mefistofeles> and yeah, I feel like the exploratory part of ntoebooks are good for making prototypes
[21:18:49] <stefan-_> notebook-driven development :)
[21:20:14] *** Quits: diogenese (~diogenese@diogenese.velotech.net) (Quit: Has anybody seen the bridge?)
[21:20:18] <mefistofeles> and there are tools that help with getting your notebook into a module/package
[21:20:28] <mefistofeles> can't remember the name now, but I know there are some that help with that
[21:20:32] *** Joins: diogenese (~diogenese@diogenese.velotech.net)
[21:20:40] <mefistofeles> (I don't use them because I'm mostly working from the IDE :P)
[21:35:13] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: didn't azure use notebooks as modules/code? I guess that didn't help their cause... I see notebooks shareable REPL sessions with graphics/images...  which is kind of hard to do in just a terminal...  But because it represents a REPL and not code, there is not defined execution order
[21:36:33] <theseb> mefistofeles: lol ..thanks for the Grus link
[21:36:40] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: yes, but there are extensions that can know/guess the execution order, as in if one cell depends on the other and such, and other tools can use that information to write a module/function from the notebook
[21:36:49] <mefistofeles> I bet it's still opinionated, but it might come handy
[21:36:55] <hodapp> stefan-_: when I used it circa 2010, it was nowhere near the 'notebook' spectrum - things were still very much in-memory only, there was no notion of a sequential session that could be saved away for later reference
[21:37:46] <theseb> hodapp: editor provide development tools and notebooks provide execution tools...you can't EXECUTE as nicely in editors and you can't DEVELOP so nicely in notebooks...they need each other like chocolate and peanut butter
[21:38:43] <hodapp> it's not really that simplistic; notebooks provide a very specific form of execution tool
[21:39:14] <mefistofeles> I like what they do with pyodide
[21:39:27] <hodapp> and the support for interactive debugging that I've had in IDEs & editors is unlike anything I've seen in notebooks
[21:39:34] <dostoyevsky2> Most notebooks on kaggle are structured like: Load data, then there are bunch of cells you could jump to, depending on what you are interested it... it's more convenient than working on a repl because the cells are already premade you just have to shift-enter on the one you are interested in and maybe make some minor adjustments... but usually it doesn't make sense to execute the
[21:39:40] <dostoyevsky2> cells sequentially, after the loading data part
[21:40:30] <HuntsMan> I have seen questions in Stack Overflow where the problem was basically that people did not understand how notebooks worked, that execution can be non-lineal
[21:40:36] <HuntsMan> *non-linear
[21:41:15] <mefistofeles> oh I meant the iodide notebook, which I just found out is dead xD
[21:42:05] <dostoyevsky2> And with pytorch you will often see model save/load... meaning, you don't have to do the data ingestion part, and just resume at some random cell in the middle, after reloading the model into memory, saving you all the time-consuming steps you did before
[21:42:12] <mefistofeles> but for example https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/300/
[21:42:12] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  (: No title)

[21:43:37] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  Starboard
[21:43:57] <hodapp> interesting... reading about Pyodide and it might be the exact thing I needed for a certain project
[21:50:15] <stefan-_> zotero 6 has been released btw - https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-6/

[21:50:26] <stefan-_> including a pdf viewer and an ios app
[21:52:06] <mefistofeles> cool, but kinda offtopic now :P
[21:52:24] <mefistofeles> nah, nvm, it's okay
[21:52:49] <hodapp> as an Official Op(tm) here I say it's fine
[21:53:23] <mefistofeles> yeah, cancel mefistofeles !
[21:53:26] <hodapp> considering how many papers we've linked to, how many a lot of us have read, and our proximity to research
[21:56:28] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: Proper PDF reading, and managing notes therein is very much a part of ML...  And I think Zotero is a possible successor for Mendeley Reader
[21:57:24] <stefan-_> i am currently using mendeley, but eager to switch to zotero

[21:59:42] <blei> less than a percent of papers from your search should end up in your word doc
[21:59:47] <hodapp> and, unsurprisingly, it ends up freeing you up to then devote more time to literature search
[22:00:05] <hodapp> there is no participation trophy for banging your head into a wall
[22:00:08] <blei> find anchor papers and trace the citations up to the last 2 years.
[22:01:14] <dostoyevsky2> It can be very nice, especially with a mobile app.... you read a paper while on the train to work, do that for 6 months and then one day you could just go through all the things you found interesting in other papers and use those ideas to write that paper of your own
[22:01:32] <blei> spend less time reading papers
[22:01:38] <blei> only skim until you find a gem
[22:02:08] <blei> you are mostly skimming papers and ruminating on your findings, so as to plan your next search query on google scholar.
[22:02:27] <hodapp> it isn't clear to me that you have even the slightest comprehension of what these tools do
[22:02:42] <blei> they are a massive waste of time
[22:02:58] <blei> you're missing out on the best papers.
[22:03:49] <hodapp> seriously doubt you've any kind of basis to make that large a generalization on everyone else's work
[22:04:14] <blei> not your call to make
[22:04:25] <blei> i can blow your lit search out of the water in 10 mins.
[22:05:22] <theseb> am i being anal for HATING the fact Jupyter notebooks have the ipython suffix?..ipynb...i want to start a revolution to force the world to use jnb instead..whose with me?
[22:06:20] <hodapp> it's sort of funny how that's "not my call", but blanket generalizations about everyone else's research and tools are completely fair game.
[22:06:39] <blei> notice that you aren't asking for proof
[22:06:39] <mefistofeles> theseb: haha, well, that's where it roots are, I guess it's for convenient historical reasons
[22:06:43] <hodapp> theseb: hmm, you can try it. at this point I forget what the difference even is between IPython and Jupyter and I understand .ipynb is a reference to the former
[22:07:02] <stefan-_> blei, one point: it can export a .bib file, which you can use in your favorite language (markdown/latex)
[22:07:02] <blei> i bet you take my advice anyways
[22:07:12] <blei> stefan-_ that can be useful if you work in a paper factory
[22:07:24] <stefan-_> yes, if you are actually writing papers

[22:07:51] <mefistofeles> hodapp: notebooks are independent of the kernel now, so you don't really need python for the notebook interface
[22:07:53] <dostoyevsky2> theseb: Yeah, the suffix is annoying to type...  Feels like you could put those cells in just the suffix by the amount of letters that are necessary
[22:08:06] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: autocomplete should take care of that
[22:08:17] <hodapp> mefistofeles: oh, I'm well aware, I've used Jupyter with many languages, but I had thought IPython was still involved even if the kernel itself is not Python
[22:08:37] <hodapp> mefistofeles: but the notebook interface still requires Python, I thought - even if your language kernel is something else
[22:08:39] <mefistofeles> hodapp: oh hmm, not that I know off, they are now completely independent projects
[22:08:43] <mefistofeles> *of
[22:09:03] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: I often do like: % cp ../templ.ipynb some-cool-topic.ipynb    ... since it's a new notebook, there is not autocomplete
[22:09:20] <hodapp> mefistofeles: guess you're right, "IPython continued to exist as a Python shell and kernel for Jupyter, but the notebook interface and other language-agnostic parts of IPython were moved under the Jupyter name."
[22:10:21] <mefistofeles> hodapp: yeah, it probably still requires python, but the code itself has almost no python at all https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/search?l=python
[22:10:22] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  Search · · jupyter/notebook
[22:11:31] <dostoyevsky2> theseb: I set up my jupyter so that it save every ipynb as a .py: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending/savehooks.html
[22:11:32] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  File save hooks — Jupyter Notebook 6.4.10 documentation
[22:11:47] <hodapp> but... .ipynb isn't Python, it's JSON
[22:12:01] * mefistofeles shrugs
[22:13:28] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: Yeah, so it's hard to grep in those files...  if they are saved as a scrubbed version with just the cell content, that makes it easier work with.  That's why jupyter has save hooks
[22:13:40] <hodapp> oh, I see what you mean

[22:15:26] <dostoyevsky2> I occasionally have to remind myself that the name jupyter is an abbrevteau of Julia Python R...
[22:15:49] <mefistofeles> wow, I never knew that
[22:15:53] <mefistofeles> is that true?
[22:16:21] <dostoyevsky2> I just edited wikipedia to confirm
[22:28:12] <hodapp> I used Apache Zeppelin for a bit too when I was doing things in the Apache ecosystem but I don't remember if it's even maintained anymore
[22:28:18] <hodapp> it was basically Apache-flavored Jupyter
[22:30:30] <dostoyevsky2> I woner what kind of a A100 GPU would one need at home to have one's own personal GPT-3 like model?  Basically just replacing google search with a local model...  Parrotting models can be very useful for search for just as intelligent code completion like openai's copilot
[22:31:45] <hodapp> hm, GPT-J is a bit more manageable I think
[22:32:15] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: you mean to train your own GPT-3?
[22:32:44] <mefistofeles> also, are you expecting to train it a lot? Because if not, maybe something cloud-based could be enough, wouldn't it?
[22:34:29] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: I think training would be more suitable for in the cloud... so mostly for inference, and fine-tuning models...  The largest A100 has like 80G RAM?
[22:37:02] *** Quits: spaceseller (~spacesell@31.147.205.13) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:40:42] <dostoyevsky2> If one had a gpt3 locally, you could just crawl like 1000 github projects, like current tensforflow notebooks... refine gpt3 on that, and have your own local codepilot, inferring from that model you've made... might work as well with 1000 google search results...
[22:41:41] <dostoyevsky2> even if it's 100000 examples to get good results, it's still manageable to crawl that from a home computer, compared to crawling the internet
[22:48:26] *** Quits: sinaowolabi (~SinaOwola@160.152.1.201) (Read error: No route to host)
[22:55:02] <dostoyevsky2> So the largest A100 has 80G gpu ram, and a price tag of USD 13K... you'd need about 200-300G to fit GPT3, so the price tag is like USD 32k - 45K ... and they probably won't be quiet... and use like 900KW
