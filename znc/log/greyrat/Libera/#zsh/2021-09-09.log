[11:52:19] <otisolsen70> The problem is that it seems to only find matches for one of the sidecar files.
[11:52:44] <otisolsen70> Is it because the -exec needs to be duplicated for each -or ?
[11:53:07] <otisolsen70> If that is the case, the I would hope there would be some way to do this without find in native zsh
[11:54:30] <otisolsen70> "$2:h" does :h mean the base filename? ie. the filename without extension and without the path?  It is my understanding that :r means the base filename without extension.

[12:01:51] <osse> otisolsen70: a sh thing in general
[12:02:21] <osse> otisolsen70: usually the process name is argv[0]. if you run ./myscript.sh or whatever then that's the name
[12:02:26] <otisolsen70> Oh. It is for the zsh -c part. Got it
[12:02:46] <otisolsen70> So if I put in 'foo', then the zsh -c process will show up in 'ps' as 'foo'?
[12:03:04] <osse> when you run sh -c 'some code here' it's effectively anonymous. so you can provide argv[0] if you want.  Problem is that to provide argv[1] you *have* to provide argv[0] before it
[12:03:11] <osse> I think so, yes
[12:14:13] <otisolsen70> Maybe I misunderstand this, but when I run "zsh -c 'sleep 30' 'foo'" and then in another shell type "ps f" I would expect to see 'foo' in the process list. I do not. I see zsh and under that a sleep process.

[13:27:09] <otisolsen70> Could not find this in "man zsh", but the following is from "man bash": If the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.  If there are arguments after the command_string, the first argument is assigned to $0 and  any  remaining  arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.

[15:55:26] <otisolsen70> I have a folder with lots of files without any file extension. So I would like to iterate through them and run file and then rename them so they have a proper file extension. So I got some of it here: for x in *~*.*; do file $x |grep "HEIF Image" > /dev/null && mv $x $x.heic; done
[15:56:28] <otisolsen70> So *~*.* I *think* means all files except the ones that have a dot in the filename (ie. they already have an extension, so ignore those) But I am not sure * works that way on the right side of  ~?
[15:58:01] <otisolsen70> And also, the pattern "HEIF Image" here works for heic files. So I think I would need an outer loop around this in which I would have a list of pairs ($pattern, $extension). For example: "PNG Image data" --> ".png", "ASCII text" --> ".txt" and so on.

[22:32:17] <Freeaqingme> Howdy, first time ZSH user and I'm trying to create a ZSH profile I can use together with P10K. Instead of just the short hostname I'd like to show the entire FQDN. Is this the place to ask for guidance?
[22:33:19] <Freeaqingme> in the ZSH docs I read that %M is the full hostname (%m being the short hostname). So I add to ~/.p10k.zsh the following, but I don't see any changes (after logging out & logging back in again):   typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE='%n@%M'

[22:45:09] <saltrocklamp[m]> otisolsen70_: `*~*.*` does what you want it to do. note that `grep -q` does the same as `grep &>/dev/null`, it's a feature in every version of grep i've used

[23:26:15] <saltrocklamp[m]> so "matching the pattern" in this case means the _entire_ filename has to match, not just a subset of it
[23:27:11] <saltrocklamp[m]> the zsh syntax highlighting doesn't handle the `##` correctly, it thinks it's a comment
