[05:46:51] <corwin> I think most org users use only a fragment of what it can do.  I suppose that's part of the power of org: we don't really have to understand what all it can do it get it to do the things we're into.

[14:22:39] <humasect> so i do not mind it for organizational uses, but project-wide prefix is can be a bit heavy.

[14:23:14] <humasect> i am wondering if prefix can be done automatically -- for eg. (load "somefile.el") or (require 'somefile) would prefix "somefile--" to all the defuns and defvars within...
[14:23:31] <humasect> kiki_lamb: makes sense
[14:25:07] <kiki_lamb> humasect: I haven't tried to do something like that yet, but it sounds possible... it seems like something that could be done with some macros, probably.
[14:26:46] <humasect> hmm
[14:28:30] <kiki_lamb> If all the definitions are at the top level of the file, it seems like you'd read it without evaluting it, loop over the items in it comparing the first item in each list to see if it's defining something... if it is, take the second argument and mangle the symbol, add it to an alist pairing the unmangled and unmangled symbols... then loop recursively over the whole tree substituting unmangled symbols

[14:31:05] <humasect> kiki_lamb: not sure if it needs to be recursive, but main problem is, inside the defuns themselves calling other defuns =)
[14:31:11] <humasect> oh, right yeah
[14:31:43] <kiki_lamb> well, assuming the functions defined in the file call each other sometimes, the recursing would be needed.

[19:16:00] <thuna`> How do you use whitespace-style? I tried reading the docstring but it didn't make much sense
[19:16:35] <Bayes> I'd suggest doing C-h v whitespace-style RET, checking the boxes you want to show up, save
[19:16:55] <Bayes> and then M-x whitespace-mode whenever you want to use it by hand
[19:17:11] <Bayes> or put it in your .el file if you want to activate it globally
[19:17:19] <Bayes> that's what I'm doing at least
[19:18:07] <Bayes> question: is setq-default what I should be using in my init.el for this? (setq-default '(whitespace-style '(face trailing lines-tail empty)))

[19:19:01] <acdw> yes

[23:23:52] <blaub> tought the would be a builtin command to search `info`
[23:26:17] <blaub> i remember there used to be a dired command, to toggle details on/off, acdw ?
[23:26:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Compu-Celebi: Active modes.

[23:53:49] <Compu-Celebi> It turns out that the second argument of the `global-set-key` invocation for a menu item must be the function to execute, instead of the menu item.

[23:55:12] <Compu-Celebi> Using the function causes the menu item's label to be automatically, properly augmented with text that denotes the keyboard shortcut.
[23:55:56] <chrisb> blaub: yes, i think prot has made that dired-hide-details-mode well known
