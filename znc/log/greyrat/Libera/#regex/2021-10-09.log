[02:53:36] <SlimmyJimmy> It's odd to me that a non-capturing group is all I have left when doing a substition where is there no replacement value.
[02:54:06] <SlimmyJimmy> I always thought of non-capturing groups as being data that is basically captured and discarded.
[03:01:26] <yitz> Those bits aren't part of the match so they don't get replaced

[03:29:23] <SlimmyJimmy> Right but at the same time they aren't part of the match so I think to myself why isn't returning something that isn't part of the match. i.e. non capturing group.
[03:29:52] <SlimmyJimmy> "why is it" not "why isn't"
[03:30:36] <SlimmyJimmy> See what I mean? How do you capture and then discard? Maybe that's what I'm really thinking a non-capturing group is by that is a conflict of wording.

[03:36:02] <SlimmyJimmy> Non-capturing to me sounds like, "Hey, found this but then ignore it because I don't really want anything to do with it". So, find it as a group but don't assign a group number because it's irrelevant.
[03:36:51] <SlimmyJimmy> The website calls is an atomic group.
[03:37:11] <Timvde> (?:) is not an atomic group
[03:37:14] <Timvde> (?>) is an atomic group
[03:37:44] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes, that's what I used, also known as a non-capturing group, right?
[03:37:57] <Timvde> No, (?:) is a non-capturing group
[03:38:00] <Timvde> They're not synonyms
[03:38:03] <SlimmyJimmy> Ah......
[03:38:09] <Timvde> (?>) prevents backtracking
[03:38:13] <SlimmyJimmy> Have I misread the website, let me check.
[03:38:25] <Timvde> What website are you reading?
[03:38:39] <SlimmyJimmy> Well, it says "ATOMIC GROUP (non-capturing)"
[03:38:43] <SlimmyJimmy> regex101.com
[03:38:49] <Timvde> An atomic group also doesn't capture :)
[03:39:03] <SlimmyJimmy> So, maybe If I try the colon it's what I want.
[03:39:03] <Timvde> Read https://www.regular-expressions.info/brackets.html and https://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html
[03:39:16] <Timvde> Well... What do you want?
[03:39:28] <SlimmyJimmy> to discard the captured group
[03:39:40] <SlimmyJimmy> But that's contradictory to the wording isnt it? :)
[03:39:45] <SlimmyJimmy> Capture and discard.
[03:39:45] <Timvde> Can you give a specific example?
[03:40:06] <Timvde> Input and expected match, or a substitution if that's what you want to do
[03:40:15] <SlimmyJimmy> Yeah for instance cat dog mouse. Okay, capture cat and mouse but cast out dog.
[03:40:44] <SlimmyJimmy> Maybe my mistake is matching what I want to discard with .+?
[03:40:56] <SlimmyJimmy> I should just leave out the .+
[03:41:07] <Timvde> Do you just want to match "cat" and "mouse" or do you want to have a string that doesn't contain "dog"?
[03:41:26] <Timvde> https://regex101.com/r/gtqWE8/1
[03:41:36] <Timvde> https://regex101.com/r/gtqWE8/2
[03:41:41] <SlimmyJimmy> I want "cat dog mouse" to become "cat mouse"
[03:41:53] <Timvde> So that's /2
[03:42:03] <Timvde> Add an extra space if you want to remove it as well
[03:42:27] <Timvde> Another option: https://regex101.com/r/gtqWE8/3
[03:42:33] <SlimmyJimmy> So, yes, thats another way to do it I guess capture the three separate parts in 3 separate groups and then replace with groups 1 and 3.
[03:42:35] <Timvde> (using capturing groups)
[03:42:50] <Timvde> So that's /3 :P
[03:42:58] <Timvde> You don't need to capture dog if you don't need its value
[03:42:58] <SlimmyJimmy> I love the versatility of computers. :)
[03:43:16] <Timvde> So just capture cat and mouse, and use $1 and $2
[03:43:29] <maroon> computers due what they're told to do, not what you want them to do
[03:43:35] <maroon> due->do
[03:43:43] <maroon> see, right there :)
[03:43:46] <SlimmyJimmy> Sounds good, thank you for helping me talk it out.
[03:43:56] <SlimmyJimmy> yep. :)
[03:45:43] <Timvde> SlimmyJimmy: regular-expressions.info is a great website
[03:46:24] <Timvde> It has a very extensive and well-written tutorial
[03:47:01] <SlimmyJimmy> Thank You, I think I've been there in the past so I kind of remember it. I wobble in and out of different computer languages/tools all the time and so I have to relearn stuff sometimes. I passed like 50+ regular expression exercises on hackerrank.com. They were really good in my opinion also.
[03:47:12] <SlimmyJimmy> I should go back and do them all again for a refresher.
[03:48:17] <Timvde> I stopped at 13 apparently
[03:48:22] <Timvde> Probably because it was too easy/boring :P
[03:48:40] <Timvde> Oh, it's with programming included?
[03:48:54] <Timvde> Maybe that's why
[03:49:04] <Timvde> regex101.com has a regex quiz as well
[03:49:13] <Timvde> It starts rather easy, but is incredibly hard in the end
[03:49:54] <Timvde> Task 1 has over 7500 solves, task 28 has 9

[15:59:03] <digitok> not sure what the actual data is, but you could also use split if it's just a longer version of the example in the link
[16:00:32] <MarioMey> Yes, it is longer. Why split, you say?
[16:01:01] <digitok> seems it's just everything split by lines of -----
[16:01:12] <digitok> so unless it contains data you don't want, you could split by that

[16:06:53] <MarioMey> I don't completely understand this regex (what's the "non-capturing group" or "positive lookahead" and why you don't use brackets for the string that I need), but it works. Thanks!
[16:07:18] *** Joins: monoxane7 (~monoxane@119-18-17-227.771211.mel.static.aussiebb.net)
[16:07:50] <digitok> non-capturing group is the same as a regular group, except it doesn't capture
[16:08:11] <MarioMey> But... I need to capture that string...
[16:08:20] <digitok> positive lookahead "peeks" ahead to match a string from a given position without consuming said string
[16:08:36] <MarioMey> I need to take that captured string.
[16:08:36] <digitok> and the brackets aren't needed because the full match is always returned as group 0
[16:08:53] <MarioMey> Brackets: Ok.
[16:09:11] <digitok> you don't need to capture anything because you want everything that was matched
[16:09:57] <MarioMey> I just used findall()... but it doesn't find anything...
[16:10:04] <digitok> and regarding the non-capturing group, where it's used there is a group which matches 1 line at a time, so if you used a capturing group, it would only store the value of the last line it matched
[16:10:15] <digitok> because captures are overwritten on each repetition of a group
[16:10:31] <digitok> are you using re.MULTILINE
[16:13:40] <MarioMey> Oh, I was not using re.compile(r'regex', re.MULTILINE).
[16:13:59] <MarioMey> I was using directly the regex without compiling.
[16:14:15] <digitok> you can pass re.MULTILINE to findall
[16:14:53] <MarioMey> How to pass the flag?
