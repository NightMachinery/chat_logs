[00:46:54] <gordonfish> You have a lot of undeclared variables, like under (and above with @servers) '###########CONST PART', just prefix `my`. And further below you have a foreach that also needs a `my` added to $server, and a declaration for a handful of variables used within the loop.
[00:47:16] <Lartza> Yeah that was mainly what prevented it from running as strict
[00:47:19] <Lartza> Not my script :D

[17:35:10] <Lynx_> How would I do the quoting correctly on this example in BASH? Not that it makes much sense...  perl -e 'system("perl -e 'print foo'")'
[17:36:31] <Botje> bash's $'...' quoting supports escapes.

[17:37:57] <choroba> Easy to git it wrong ;-)
[17:38:45] <Lynx_> Yes... Both don't print foo though? Not that it matters for the quoting question.

[17:39:12] <Botje> deparse: print foo
[17:39:13] <perlbot> Botje: No output.
[17:39:29] <Botje> it thinks you're trying to print to a filehandle named foo
[17:39:38] <Lynx_> Is there a way to make it readable with q{} and/or qq{}?
[17:39:41] <Lynx_> Botje: I see
[17:39:54] <Botje> you can push one layer of quoting down
[17:40:08] <Botje> perl -e 'system(qq(perl -E "say q(foo)"))'
[17:40:21] <Botje> with all consequences.
[17:45:28] <Lynx_> Thanks
[17:49:28] <Lynx_> So I ask because I have something like this  perl -ne 'system("zcat $_ | #do stuff# | gzip > $_.out.gz")' files.txt   I noticed I wanted to stick a perl regex sub in there after the #do stuff#. Still can't get that right.
[17:49:59] <Lynx_> Something like this: perl -e 'system qq(echo foo | perl -pe qq( s/foo/bar/ ) )'

[17:50:56] <Botje> qq() is not something the shell understands.
[17:51:22] <Botje> perl -ne $'system(".... | perl -pe \'s/foo/bar/\' | ....")'
[17:51:24] <Botje> or just

[17:51:38] <Botje> perl -ne 'system(q(... | perl -pe "s/foo/bar/" | ...))'
[17:52:14] <revhippie> is system() really the only thing happening in that outer perl?
[17:52:25] <Botje> note the -n there
[17:52:35] <Botje> it's reading a list of filenames from stdin
[17:52:42] <revhippie> ahhhh, right.

[20:45:24] <gordonfish> [OT] Wondering, if anyone else has seen strange errors like "operand type mismatch for `vpcmpeqb'", etc, which I saw when trying to build coreutils-9.0 on a 32-bit system (it's a Linux system at a client that I need to build by hand on) ? http://paste.debian.net/hidden/5bf5b612/

[20:46:57] <simcop2387> gordonfish: that looks like a gcc bug, running a very old version of gcc
[20:47:34] <gordonfish> 7.x doesn't feel all that old. It's from 2017, not 2007
[20:47:40] <simcop2387> gordonfish: you can probably disable the avx2 bits to work around that
[20:51:08] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Tried removing -mavx2 and got http://paste.debian.net/hidden/139892c7/

[20:54:32] <simcop2387> hmm, yea i'm not seeing a way to disable the avx2 wc stuff easily
[20:55:26] <simcop2387> it looks like something that'll be different about the avx2 stuff from a newer compiler
[20:57:03] <simcop2387> compiles fine on gcc11
[20:58:04] <simcop2387> i'd try editing the configure script to act like avx2 isn't available, look for USE_AVX2_WC_LINECOUNT_TRUE

[20:59:49] <simcop2387> ah that might explain it
[21:00:25] <simcop2387> those sets of tools are so incestuous it's hard to do one without the others
