[00:01:59] <Grinnz> make sure that you are calling your queries while the $tx is in scope, and on the same $db that you called begin on
[00:02:54] <phryk> Grinnz: Not 100% sure what "in scope" here means, but I assume that's where my problem lies. :P

[00:05:10] <phryk> Grinnz: Yes, but what about child(?) scopes? I'm doing $db->begin and then call some model functions doing $db->insert before the $tx->commit
[00:05:36] <Grinnz> you mean sub calls?
[00:05:42] <phryk> yes.
[00:05:53] <Grinnz> here we're referring to the runtime scope, so as long as the scope where you declared it hasn't exited yet, it'll still be active
[00:06:09] <Grinnz> and you're passing that exact $db in to the model functions to act on?
[00:06:48] <phryk> They access the same Mojo::Pg objects' ->db, so I think within a request that should be true‚Ä¶
[00:06:53] <Grinnz> it isn't
[00:07:29] <Grinnz> it's a connection manager. it may hold more than one connection, and won't give the same one that's currently active
[00:07:43] *** Joins: kensanata (~user@user/kensanata)
[00:08:05] <phryk> Oh, I assumed it'd pick one available connection at the begin of the request and stick with it. Thanks for pointing that out.^^
[00:08:07] <Grinnz> normally accessing a new ->db in a sub call is the right thing to do. a transaction is the exception, that must be completed with the same db object
[00:08:15] <Grinnz> a transaction only exists in one connection
[00:09:25] <phryk> Aye. So I should add an optional parameter for the db object‚Ä¶ Also have to look up whether nested transactions are a thing cause I just noticed one query depends on having the result from the other‚Ä¶
[00:09:56] <Grinnz> they aren't - you can use savepoints for that effect, but Mojo::Pg doesn't support that

[00:12:12] <Grinnz> this sort of stuff gets kind of tricky as to the right balance of abstraction
[00:13:02] <Grinnz> if you really need it, you should be able to use https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::Pg#Savepoints on the $db->dbh during the transaction

[02:35:58] <Grinnz> well, the ircv3 proposal tracker is over there
[02:36:31] <gordonfish> I personally rather like the idea of building upon existing things, extending it without destroying compatibility with old clients. There's a whole host of things in the tech world that could learn a thing or two from that.

[02:36:45] <Grinnz> like a certain programming language
[02:37:53] <gordonfish> Well before I ever heard of ircv3 I always thought the existing irc protocol could be extended in such a way that new things could be added that new willing clients could take advantage of, and was rather impressed when I first learned that that was reality.

[19:37:38] <Grinnz> always put inline package definitions in BEGIN
