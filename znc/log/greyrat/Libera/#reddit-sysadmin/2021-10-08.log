[00:00:01] <Hunterkll> since hyper-v's the same on 11/latest  10 builds/2022 
[00:00:09] <Hunterkll> Aurora doesn't have separate dev trains
[00:00:13] <Activ8> aw well that rules that out
[00:00:13] <Hunterkll> just which features are enabled/not 
[00:00:31] <Hunterkll> now, it could be something wiht hyper-v/your hardware/something that win11 pokes now
[00:00:43] <Hunterkll> kind of like how 2012 R2/8.1 dropped support for a whole swath of 64 bit CPUs 
[00:00:50] <Hunterkll> even though 2012/8 ran fine on them 
[00:00:56] <Activ8> now the problem is, microsoft won't support it since it's not an upto date system
[00:01:01] <Activ8> so fuck knows if they ever fix that issue
[00:01:09] <Hunterkll> you'd have to know what the issue is first
[00:01:15] <Hunterkll> for all that it matters, it could be a stupid bios setting
[00:01:21] <Activ8> possibly
[00:01:23] <yuken> how the fuck did my package get from Indianapolis to Cleveland in 40 minutes
[00:01:28] <Hunterkll> and they didn't even officially drop support for those CPUs in the requirements either, it just didn't work
[00:01:29] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:01:31] <yuken> I mean, it is FedEx Express, so... plane?
[00:01:34] <Activ8> next time it does it I'll check logs where possible
[00:01:52] <Activ8> will be plane
[00:02:03] <Activ8> wasn't a pidgeon thats for sure
[00:03:56] <Activ8> I signed up so some free network stuff two weeks ago
[00:04:05] <Activ8> and I got an email 2 days ago saying my package is in germany
[00:04:15] <Activ8> it's some network cables with a light sensor on them

[00:05:03] <Hunterkll> yeesh
[00:05:14] <Activ8> whoop
[00:05:23] <Activ8> Hunterkll I built that .deb package 
[00:05:26] <Hunterkll> Activ8: your CPU is in the age range of where it's almost time to add that generation to my legacy bench for component testing for resale
[00:05:27] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:05:29] <yuken> Activ8, is it supposed to be in Germany?
[00:05:33] <Activ8> worked a treat
[00:05:42] <Activ8> yuken supposed to be yes
[00:05:47] <Hunterkll> Activ8: yea a lot of projects have package build things like that instead of having to roll your own
[00:05:58] <Hunterkll> always something to keep in mind to look for if you're building from source
[00:06:19] <Activ8> it was literally 3 lines of code and it built the package itself lol
[00:06:37] <Activ8> I sent it to the devs to upload, the guy who supposed to do it had a laptop issue and lost a lot of stuff
[00:06:41] <Activ8> or something like that anyway
[00:06:49] <Activ8> so I said I would investigate and built package ready
[00:07:03] <Hunterkll> Activ8: well, it's a bit more than just 3 lines of code :P https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb/blob/master/build-package
[00:07:16] <Activ8> well kinda once I got the vm built
[00:07:22] <Activ8> I just did it on my laptop
[00:07:24] <Hunterkll> 3 lines to run it :P 
[00:07:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[00:07:39] <Activ8> I still had to build the debian vm
[00:07:44] <Activ8> and ssh to get the .deb
[00:07:59] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> just run it in docker 🙂
[00:08:00] <Hunterkll> i don't actually see anything reliant on debian in this
[00:08:10] <Hunterkll> should run on suse etc just fine as long as you have deb/dpkg utils available
[00:08:38] <Activ8> it built correctly so I assume there was no errors
[00:08:49] <Activ8> ended up with a final package stored in output folder
[00:08:54] <Activ8> with no errors
[00:09:06] <Hunterkll> heh
[00:09:10] <Activ8> must be their script that does it automatically 
[00:09:14] <Activ8> if it works it works
[00:09:15] <Hunterkll> Activ8: they had updated the deb build scripts with the version in the control file 
[00:09:16] <Hunterkll> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb/blob/master/debian/control
[00:09:17] <Hunterkll> already
[00:09:18] <Activ8> I don't care how it got there 
[00:09:32] <Activ8> yeh they did
[00:20:19] <Hunterkll> wonder why whoever did the updates to that didn't just spit out the pcakgage... lol
[00:22:13] <Activ8> their laptop was in for repair and offline for a little while
[00:22:42] <Hunterkll> 2 months ago?

[01:09:14] <Hunterkll> it doesn't specify any actual technology

[01:09:20] <A-KO> DomLS3: bitlocker/tls should be fine. But you can go further with certain database tech and do row-level encryption if you really want to get fancy
[01:09:24] <Hunterkll> nothing in the OCR audit checklist 
[01:09:35] <Hunterkll> actually has a required finding/audit require fix 
[01:09:38] <Hunterkll> that mentions encryption

[01:10:58] <Hunterkll> for example
[01:11:06] <Hunterkll> but the 'A' findings can be neutered by not requiring them in policy
[01:11:56] <Hunterkll> for HIPAA, policy/procedure is far, far higher a requirement than actual technical controls - of which t here are almost none in the law other than vauge guidelines

[01:12:24] <Hunterkll> right
[01:12:30] <Hunterkll> but a written risk assessment is all you need

[01:15:40] <DomLS3> in your XP scenario... XP is end of life and no longer supported
[01:15:46] <Hunterkll> right
[01:16:07] <bloody> heh, the glassdoor reviews confirm that it was indeed a red flag :)

[01:17:09] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: hence, you have to consider any known vulnerabilities in your risk assessment
[01:17:11] <DomLS3> so if it is no longer supported and no longer getting updates on vulnerabilities... how can it be hipaa compliant? I feel like even if it's unplugged from the internet that it's still in violation simply because there's written documentation saying it's end of life and no longer supported
[01:17:14] <Hunterkll> instead of relying on vendor patches to fix it
[01:17:31] <Hunterkll> "HHS added that healthcare organizations must consider any known vulnerabilities – notably whether patches are available for security threats and whether the manufacturer still supports the OS – in their risk analysis.
[01:17:31] <Hunterkll> "
[01:17:55] <Hunterkll> the easy answer is just upgrade shit
[01:18:01] <Hunterkll> the long answer is there's no actual vendor support requirement in HIPAA
[01:18:22] <Hunterkll> and it becomes a hell of a paperwork exercise, but can be *made* compliant by paperwork exercise
[01:18:24] <DomLS3> but that contradicts what you said. If XP is technically hipaa compliant why would you need to upgrade it
[01:18:38] <Hunterkll> no, i said the "easy" and "long" answer
[01:18:42] <Hunterkll> there's no contradiction there

[01:29:46] <DomLS3> "There is a data retention requirement in HIPAA. HIPAA documentation must be retained for a period of six years from the data of creation or the last time the documentation was in effect, whichever is the later."

[01:29:51] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: right.
[01:29:54] <DomLS3> EOP1 doesn't come with data retention
[01:29:57] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: but
[01:29:59] <DomLS3> so it would not be hipaa compliant
[01:30:02] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: that's not saying you have to retain the email copies
[01:30:07] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: where did the person get the data from?
[01:30:08] <Hunterkll> if that's backed up
[01:30:11] <Hunterkll> then email doesn't matter
[01:30:23] <int0x1C8> if you can show actual good faith in attempting to comply, it can only help
[01:30:24] <Hunterkll> say a Dr pulls a report from their EHR system then emails it to a client
[01:30:31] <Hunterkll> the EHR system being backed up is enough 
[01:30:40] <Hunterkll> you don't need to back up two copies of the data from different sources
[01:30:58] <DomLS3> But what about the communication itself
[01:31:14] <DomLS3> if you're speaking about the patient data in the email
[01:31:26] <Hunterkll> if you're discussing it, but it's not new data
[01:31:28] <Hunterkll> then it's not in that scope
[01:31:33] <sd> 08<J​TR> DomLS3: This is the documentation only, and there are many ways to achieve the required retention — DLP is not necessary to attain it (and having DLP does not guarantee that you will attain it at all, you can easily fail to attain it with DLP).
[01:31:34] <Hunterkll> if it's the *only record* of new data
[01:31:36] <Hunterkll> then it is n scope
[01:31:48] <Hunterkll> but if it's new data being received
[01:31:51] <Hunterkll> that is then put into the EHR
[01:31:55] <Hunterkll> then you don't care about the email coipy anymore
[01:32:08] <DomLS3> Developing a HIPAA email retention policy that includes securely archiving all emails containing PHI will ensure that in the event of an audit, dispute with a patient, or litigation, all relevant sent and received emails can quickly and easily be retrieved.
[01:32:08] <DomLS3> An email archive is also important for complying with state data retention requirements, which can require a much broader range of data to be retained, and for longer than is required by HIPAA.

[01:45:57] <Hunterkll> i suppose except for when contracts got kicked over to legal for review for vendor services or whatever, but even then, the rest was all just a few people doing it all in that 150 person group

[01:51:15] <Hunterkll> in reality, a sane risk assessment will say "okay, data in between email server and sender/recipient could be intercepted" which the logical answer would be encryption, which would THEN make it required

[01:53:47] <Hunterkll> DomLS3: best bet, is to slog through this, write up the docs/policies, contact an auditor for a 'mock audit' of some type, and see what they say after that 
[01:55:10] <Hunterkll> but also note functions like legal hold *aren't meant to be used like this*
[01:55:14] <Hunterkll> for data retention
[01:55:24] <Hunterkll> you'd want some kind of 3rd party O365 backup solution 
[01:56:58] <bloody> yuken you sure have a lot of packages lol
[01:57:04] <Hunterkll> because the requirement is availability, and if O365 is down, you've violated that requirement
[01:57:55] <Hunterkll> reasonable RTO/RPO is fine too, but if O365 has a data loss event as well, you're boned. So say, restoring from tape taking 1-2 days for everything? that's fine, but if you have no way to even ETA the restore time, you're boned

It is used for medical treatment and could some day find use in deep diving and space travel. Liquid breathing is sometimes called fluid breathing, but this can be confusing because both liquids and gases can be called fluids.

[17:39:21] <signofzeta> Citrix MultiUser and its ICA protocol originally ran on OS/2, but Microsoft announced they were shifting focus to Windows.
[17:39:52] <signofzeta> Citrix signed a licensing deal to use the Windows NT 3.5 source code to make the ICA protocol better.
[17:40:10] <signofzeta> Then, Micorosft licensed ICA right back to create RDP.
[17:40:21] <signofzeta> There's a story: https://www.basvankaam.com/2017/03/29/a-lesson-in-history-the-citrix-ica-and-microsoft-rdp-early-days/

[18:26:51] <signofzeta> based on the stupid README.WRI file, it sounds like Exchange 4.0 didn't even have SMTP enabled by default.  I bet I'm wrong.
[18:27:06] <Lob3rFsociety> POP3
[18:27:29] <signofzeta> Fun fact: Microsoft Mail covered versions 2.1 through 3.5.  Version 1.0 was Consumers Software "Network Courier", which Microsoft bought and turned into MS Mail.
[18:27:31] <xe0n> yeah i did an NT4 to AD and exchange 5.5 to errr 2007 migration lol
[18:27:52] <xe0n> outlook debuted with version 97, was an exchange client, outlook 98 added pop3
[18:28:14] <xe0n> hence outlook has always sucked with pop3\imap....because....its legacy
[18:28:21] <xe0n> hence...the new "one outlook" coming eventually...

[18:29:01] <sintax> they could probably move on as an OS and server etc...if they'd start dropping for support for stuff from 10-20 years ago
[18:29:10] <xe0n> exmerge

[18:29:11] <signofzeta> MSMail/Exchange supported PROFS, SNADS, SMTP, X.25, X.400, NNTP, MHS, MCI Mail, AT&T Mail, and Unified Messaging.  Only SMTP survived.
[18:29:12] <xe0n> it sucked.
[18:29:40] <signofzeta> dropping legacy support would be great, but they had to state, almost twenty years later, that Excel 4.0 macros will be disabled by default.

[19:35:44] <Jaelae> I’m so confused
[19:35:48] <csws> I reset the password and jumped in, could see TVs hooked up and a real CC on it, dox of some random people in the US

[19:43:14] <Jaelae> So confused
[19:43:28] <JollyRgrs> Jaelae: that's odd. some guy once created an account with Lids (hat store in the mall) and some other thing as well (snapchat I think) using my email b/c his email was similar... but I'm like "yo dawg, don't you know your own email?"... i didn't say anything to him he was just too dumb (I know b/c i logged into his snapchat)
[19:43:53] <Jaelae> This is like no way it’s a mistake cause it’s a custom domain
[19:44:04] <JollyRgrs> he was a douche, so you know what I did? snapped at all these girls and caused a lot of trouble for him :D
[19:44:23] <JollyRgrs> Jaelae: oh dang... i dunno then, that's really odd
[19:46:16] <int0x1C8> lol I just got to flex my passive aggressive mode to a senior manager just now
[19:47:19] <int0x1C8> sent a ticket in saying the internet was down at our nursery site which he supervises, my coworker gets there to find out he had decided to "clean up" the IT equipment and gather all the stuff he thought wasn't needed
[19:48:16] <bloody> wtf is wrong with ppl
[19:48:37] <Lob3rFsociety> wow LOL some people think they can just unplug IT equipment, it's awful.
[19:48:48] <int0x1C8> ended up disconnecting the pfsense box running the VPN tunnel for the site and putting it in the "disposal" pile, and completely fucked where everything was plugged into on the switch
[19:48:49] <Lob3rFsociety> We had to put up paper stickers saying DO NOT UNPLUG
[19:49:42] <bloody> some people have absolutely no capability to think logicically 
[19:49:52] <iphone> those people end up on discord
[19:50:06] <int0x1C8> so I got to send him a strong passive aggressively worded "welp, sucks to be you" response on the ticket that we cannot restore functionality to the site right away
[19:50:17] <int0x1C8> because of unauthorized changes to IT equipment
[19:50:28] <bloody> good
[19:50:37] <koollman> keys or codes go a long way to avoid this kind of stuff. Of course, proper inventory helps too
[19:51:00] <int0x1C8> my boss has the day off, but he would be pissed if he were here
