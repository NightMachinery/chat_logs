[00:38:02] *** ahorner is now known as Pokey
[00:38:29] <ezio> And I've never been rude to this guy or short with him.  I encourage him.  When he fixed it I even answered with "Top shelf.  Yeah, that issue took me a while to track down.  Lot's of hairpulling."  And he's told my supervisor that I'm condescending and I make him feel stupid.
[00:39:16] <ezio> One day, he said something wasn't working, and I said, "Do you have your cache cleared?  Open up DevTools, go to Network, check Disable cache."
[00:39:29] <bomb> this is you -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeLZs1JSR8
[00:39:41] <ezio> And he fucking snapped on me telling me that I was condescending and making him feel stupid.
[00:40:25] <ezio> So I went and looked.  He didn't have DevTools open, which I told him it needs to be open when you refresh, but I also saw that he didn't have Disable cache checked which would've stayed that way if he had ever done it.
[00:43:01] <ezio> When he snapped on me, too, I was like: "I'm so sorry.  I did not intend to make you feel like that.  I've always found you to be professional and competent.  I in no way was condescending."  And I meant it.  He's very good at his job.  I'm really only upset because he goes and tells my supervisor that I'm condescending.
[00:43:33] <bomb> you need a beer or two

[00:44:34] <bomb> indifference is the only way to stop skilled manipulators, unless you're also one of them.
[00:46:25] <ezio> Oh, I have been yeah whatevs until it reached a boiling point when one day I said, "Sorry, I couldn't finish that before 6pm because I didn't get it until 4:45 and I had plans with a friend at 6, but I finished it after that."  And he went and told the supervisor how I bailed to hang out with a friend when he works late all the time.
[00:46:59] <bomb> what an asshole
[00:47:16] <ezio> No one in the entire company works late nights like I do.  I don't have a family.  So I can, and don't mind, picking things up when there's an emergency.
[00:47:51] <ezio> I'm married to my career.
[00:48:08] <bomb> what does the supervisor feel like about the motherfucker being a whiny bitch all the time?
[00:48:55] <ezio> He told me that he's made a few complaints before, but I just told him to deal with it, but this one he was really upset about.
[00:49:42] <bomb> saw the guy's mouth to the supervisor's anus to make a human octoped
[00:49:51] <ezio> Called me unprofessional.
[00:49:56] <bomb> *sew
[00:50:32] <ezio> And still, I apologized to him profusely just to maintain the relationship.
[00:50:47] <bomb> tell hem if he can't see the guy's game, he should be a sex worker downtown instead of a manager at a software firm
[00:50:54] <bomb> that's a professional career advice
[00:51:11] <bomb> yeah ezio grow some ffs, why are you keep apologizing?
[00:51:51] <ezio> Because I don't want an openly-hostile environment.  That would be just 24/7 mental anguish.
[00:52:15] <bomb> that would be passive aggressive
[00:52:15] <ezio> Even if I'm right, it doesn't make my life better to fight with him.

[01:08:29] <ezio> No way.  Hell no.  lol.  I'm not going to involve my supervisor.  He can see what's happening.  I took the high road and I think he knows it.

[01:09:16] <Nasp> And even before closing time
[01:09:27] <Nasp> Yeah he's a douche
[01:09:31] <Nasp> And will continue being a douche
[01:12:53] <brianonymous> i just wouldnt make the assumption that anyone knows anything. ive been burned by that before
[01:13:34] <brianonymous> you are the first level of douchery management. if that fails, its your managers prob
[01:14:47] <brianonymous> he makes more money just cuz of that
[01:15:05] <bpmedley_> ezio : Sounds like a clusterfuck
[01:15:14] <ezio> I just don't want anyone to pick me as a guy who has conflict in the office.  You know?
[01:15:56] <brianonymous> then you must smash your evil coworkers face into the keyboard
[01:15:58] <bpmedley_> As long as there is no really bad raised voices or violence, then maybe consider being as perfect as possible and letting other people notice when he goes off
[01:16:17] <ezio> bpmedley_ gets it
[01:16:56] <brianonymous> if someone is being a douche, im gonna let em know in no uncertain terms
[01:17:30] <brianonymous> no time for any of that \o/
[01:18:50] <ezio> exactly.  That's why this is like the third time I've mentioned it in 2.5 years.  It really doesn't bother me much, but that thing recently ...
[01:20:06] <Nasp> I worked at a place that started complaining i didn't do a weeks extra work over the weekend because it was important
[01:20:14] <Nasp> Got told some late friday and i had guests arriving
[01:20:21] <Nasp> I just said i would try but i had guest coming over
[01:20:32] <Nasp> Monday morning the CEO gave me hell for not being done
[01:20:41] <bpmedley_> I wish work places cared some, even a little bit
[01:20:42] <Nasp> That was the point where i stopped caring and later found a new job
[01:21:02] <Nasp> And i should really have done that a lot ealier, it wore me down so much
[01:21:37] <Nasp> And it was such a one way street, work overtime with no payment, then leave the office for 2 hours to go to the dentist and get deducted in salary
[01:23:38] <Nasp> So my recommendation is, get a new job
[01:24:26] <ezio> Me?
[01:24:56] <ezio> No way.  I like this job.  I even like him.  That's partly why I shut down all possibility of argument right away.
[01:25:42] <bpmedley_> Strange world
[01:26:12] <brianonymous> then roll with 'hey, im just trying to help you out, please stop shitting all over me when i try to help'

[01:33:28] <Nasp> But you still need to vent hmm
[01:33:29] <ezio> No use going nuclear because I had to be right.
[01:33:42] <ezio> Nasp, better here than there.
[01:34:37] <Nasp> But there shouldn't be fricton like that at all
[01:35:28] <ezio> I agree, but going to my supervisor and getting him in shit isn't going to alleviate the friction.
[01:35:45] <Nasp> Why not
[01:36:08] <Nasp> Oh well some people need to be the sub in an abusive relationship
[01:36:41] <brianonymous> you start out telling him to stfu.. when/if that fails, thats when you rope in bossman

[03:07:03] <Nasp> Does it have date support?

[03:47:19] <bpmedley_> brianonymous : https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html  <-- This page and and the one you mentioned should help.  I don't think there is a native DATE type in SQLite.
[03:47:40] <brianonymous> is it better to force them to REAL for sorts?
[03:48:17] <bpmedley_> brianonymous : I sometimes use INTEGERS for date values in SQLite.  However, for Inserted and Updated I want the DATE expressions working on them.
[03:50:22] <brianonymous> gotcha
[03:50:38] <Nasp> I wonder what EF does with sqllite
[03:50:44] <Nasp> If it maps it to text or an integer
[03:50:51] <brianonymous> so far its been super easy, i already got a replacement for my list.. just the basics
[03:50:59] <brianonymous> its mapping to text
[03:52:35] <Nasp> Seems like it maps it to integers

[05:33:02] <sysRPL> i know this is the right channel, but i just ended my relationship with my elderly and infirm mother tonight
[05:33:25] <sysRPL> a few days before christmas. i need to talk to someone
[05:33:55] <sysRPL> pardon me, this **isn't** the right channel
[05:36:22] <bomb> you're in the right place, friendo
[05:36:32] <bomb> but let me learn what does infirm mother mean first
[05:36:54] <bomb> oh, it's normal mother
[05:37:32] <bomb> excuse my ignorance. English not native tongue mine, first time I seen the word "infirn"
[05:37:44] <bomb> but it describes my own mom pretty well lol

[05:38:16] <bpmedley_> sysRPL : Is she still alive or ?.
[05:39:06] <sysRPL> she is alive but really can't walk and wears adult diapers if that helps you understand her situation
[05:39:55] <bomb> doesn't give us any idea about her mental state
[05:39:59] <bpmedley_> I have a tepid relationship with my mother.  What helped me was talk therapy and some groups.  I went to CoDA because I was in a small town and there were few resoureces.
[05:40:10] <sysRPL> a few years ago we had a breakdown after we got food poisoning one christmas
[05:40:12] <bomb> anyway, why did you kick her out from your home?

[05:40:45] <bomb> I mean, it's cold outside, and you're not in Australia, are you?
[05:41:01] <bpmedley_> Dealing with the elderly is difficult, I have noticed.  When I have done that, sometimes they get confused more easily than others.
[05:41:03] <sysRPL> a few months after that i told her to be sure to wash her hands after she begged me to prepare some suspect chicken
[05:42:48] <sysRPL> about an hour later there was chicken blood and juice all over her and the kitchen, she said she needed a shower which i agreed ... two hours went by and she was still at her computer dirty as hell and typing away goolging msnbc related stuff
[05:43:19] <bpmedley_> Also, what helped me was dissociating and compartmentalizing.
[05:43:28] <sysRPL> after begging her to stop and take a shower i finally raised my voice and basically told her to take a shower
[05:44:11] <bpmedley_> A friend of mine had a husband that has a memory condition and so does my grandmother.
[05:44:17] <bomb> dude wtf respect your mom's privacy
[05:44:20] <sysRPL> then she lost herself saying she wished to die, that i really didn't love her, that i was after her money or something

[05:44:51] *** Parts: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (‎)
[05:45:12] <sysRPL> since that event i basically put her on notice anytime she tried to guilt me with bullshit
[05:46:24] <bpmedley_> Without professional counseling and peers in also odd situations, I'm not sure where I would be
[05:46:26] <sysRPL> tonight was the third time i after that fiasco where she said she wanted to die that i said in no uncertain terms she was putting our relationship at risk with her behavior
[05:47:16] <bpmedley_> Really, what I learned in counseling and groups, that helped the most, was coping skills and how to interact better with people (in theory).
[05:47:45] <sysRPL> well
[05:49:18] <sysRPL> everytime i ask her consider the things she says and how she says them and ask her to talk to me, she turns her back on me and refuses mend the situation
[05:50:11] <sysRPL> in regards to saving our relationship she said she sees no point because i'll get over whatever in a few days
[05:50:51] <sysRPL> i drive her to doctors appoints, clean her bed, pick up her medicine, deliver her meals
[05:51:31] <sysRPL> after tonight no more
[05:51:41] <bpmedley_> Wow.  What stressful situation.
[05:52:09] <sysRPL> and before christmas :(
[05:52:38] <sysRPL> i said some hurtful things to her tonight after she pulled her usual bullshit
[05:52:48] <bpmedley_> I screamed at my brother when he had terminal cancer the night before he left and I never saw him alive..
[05:53:18] <sysRPL> i said whatever relation we had is over, and told her to to enjoy the rest of whatever short life she has to live without me
[05:54:01] <bpmedley_> Sounds intense.
[05:54:05] <sysRPL> yeah
[05:54:12] <sysRPL> i think it's done
[05:54:31] <sysRPL> she'll probably want to modify her will
[05:54:45] <sysRPL> not that i care about that
[05:55:14] <sysRPL> i think the problem is she has lost a lot of her mind, but she insists otherwise
[05:55:49] <bpmedley_> As did my grandmother.  Strangely, a lot of people with brain conditions do not acknowledge or know.
[05:56:01] <sysRPL> also she has never wanted to mend anything with anyone ever. she refuses to talk to people all the time because of imagined sleights
[05:57:00] <sysRPL> do you know who women pair up with hairdressers? that is they find one they like and then go to them and only them?
[05:57:14] <bpmedley_> Yes
[05:58:00] <sysRPL> my mom had a hairdresser for 20 years, then one time, and one time only that hairdresser couldn't accommodate my mom's schedule for an appointment
[05:58:48] <sysRPL> we used to have this hairdresser over for chistmas / thanksgiving, but my mom never called her again after her hairdresser couldn't make her one appointment
[05:59:45] <bpmedley_> Sounds like some of the things my friend's husband and my grandmother would do.
[05:59:45] <sysRPL> she won't take phone calls from her bridge partner and next door neighbor for 30 years because she imagines our neighbor didn't call he on the phone enough
[06:00:27] <sysRPL> anyhow it sucks, but i think this is finally it
[06:00:56] <sysRPL> she is going to die, and we aren't going to have any more good times together
[06:01:15] <sysRPL> and i might be encouraging her demise because i am not going to care for her anymore
[06:01:17] <bpmedley_> Life is painful
[06:07:19] <bpmedley_> Almost all of my decisions I've made I've done my best with my particular set of feelings and the current situation.  I look back on that a lot for self care, being kind to myself, and trying for understanding.  Very difficult to do in the heat of the moment.

[11:26:46] <bomb> and lockdowns are coming back
[11:27:04] <bomb> I'm surprised you're not working from home already.
[11:29:37] <Tobbi> My company is kinda against that.
[11:29:40] <Tobbi> And I'm okay with that.
[11:29:44] <Tobbi> I need the social interaction
[11:30:00] <bomb> yeah me too
[11:30:16] <MatthiasVance> I miss the social interaction however I get so much more freedom
[11:30:25] <bomb> it's actually great your company is resisting that nonsense.
[11:30:36] <Tobbi> Maybe, yeah
[11:30:41] <Tobbi> I wouldn't be able to anyway.

[11:33:48] <Tobbi> She was very manipulative
[11:33:54] <Tobbi> It was...straining.
[11:33:57] <Tobbi> Because it affected me.

[11:38:03] <MatthiasVance> It's low-impact, you can define your own pace
[11:38:35] <Tobbi> I never considered it...
[11:38:39] <MatthiasVance> Do note that for burning fat that might not fly (the your own pace) because then your heart rate is important

[13:11:01] <MaNa2k> what you guys think about the d15 noctua fan ?
[13:11:24] <MaNa2k> i baught one yesterday, and damn it was big
[13:13:07] <MatthiasVance> 🤷‍♂️
[13:14:39] <MaNa2k> also got a new wide case
[13:14:45] <MaNa2k> and a bigger motherboard
[13:15:50] <MatthiasVance> Wide case of beer
[13:18:48] <MaNa2k> was originally just planning to get a new cpu. So i landed on r7 5800x, then later found out i also neede a new motherboard and ram and cooler. Got a micro atx motherboard because i wanted to resue my old case. The coolor wouldnt fit in my existing case. so i also got a new case. Then i though why not just get an atx as well, so i did lol
[13:23:59] <MaNa2k> so why is "indomitable" on ban list ?
[13:24:11] <MaNa2k> i remember he helped me big time once
[13:24:30] <MatthiasVance> Why do you think someone is on a ban list?
[13:24:52] <MatthiasVance> Ambiguous, I'll try again: What do you think could be a reason that someone is on a ban list?

[13:26:03] <MaNa2k> maybe he said something stupid or something ?
[13:26:30] <MatthiasVance> In general, if people are being mostly disruptive they end up there
[13:26:45] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, so what did he do ?
[13:26:57] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: I guess being mostly disruptive? ;)
[13:27:10] <MaNa2k> lol
[13:27:33] <MaNa2k> not sure what that mean
[13:28:11] <MaNa2k> anyway i kind of get it
[13:28:17] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: If you make a lot of people feel bad all the time.. that consists as being disruptive. There are of course others. Spamming is one.
[13:28:32] <MatthiasVance> It's always the same general reason why someone ends up there
[13:28:44] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, ah lol that

[13:30:30] <MatthiasVance> And that does happen
[13:31:17] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, i think it just adds spicy to the channel habing people that are slight disruptive
[13:31:28] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, in general I like noctua products. But I only bought fans so far. An apropriate cooler solution from them did not fit in my housing (no narrow)
[13:31:48] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Yeah only if you cross lines all the time you are out, otherwise no issue
[13:31:54] <MaNa2k> mhm
[13:32:55] <MaNa2k> MichaelLong, had the same issue with this fan, would fit in my old case, was too high. So i got a new case. Wasnt that expensive as i tought. Also got an ATX board

[20:32:26] <ezio> Microsoft wants to bend the world to its will of doing different, uncomfortable, and weird shit.
[20:32:34] <ezio> CRLF for example
[20:32:49] <ezio> Microsoft Teams for a more contemporary example.
[20:32:55] <ezio> Is a steaming pile of garbage.
[20:33:49] <ezio> File systems that are incompatible with anything else.
[20:34:36] <ezio> But they lead the market and have the best user OS.
[20:34:45] <ezio> So people just accept it.

[21:29:13] <sysRPL> have you ppl replaced `if (obj != null)` with `if (obj is not null)` in all your cs files yet?
[21:30:14] <sysRPL> sure it's wordier, but it bypasses any potential operator overloading
[21:38:42] <jonp> i have not, don't plan on it, and if i truly cared about avoiding operator overloading i'd use ReferenceEquals(obj, null)
[21:50:08] <Nasp> If people have fucked up in overloading I doubt using is null really helps

[22:04:12] <sysRPL> you'd use `if (!ReferenceEquals(obj, null))`
[22:05:32] <sysRPL> actually
[22:07:34] <sysRPL> it would be `if (!Object.ReferenceEquals(obj, q))`
[22:07:48] <sysRPL> vs `if (obj is not null)`

[22:38:01] <bomb> MatthiasVance .cs to .java?
[22:41:39] <chilversc> don't I havn't touched .net in 4 years now, this last year has mostly been bash, terraform and golang
[22:45:14] <bomb> chilversc why are you even in this channel??
[22:46:49] <chilversc> at some point I want to catch up on some of the changes :)
[22:46:52] <ern> The chat holds a place for those who chat.
[22:47:25] <bpmedley_> chilversc : I love working with .Net 6 and the command line.  I use zsh..
[23:09:19] <canton7> sysRPL, no need for the 'Object.' there -- just 'ReferenceEquals' works fine
