[00:52:36] <Henry151> i actually do get backup successful messages every morning at 4am when my tarsnap backup of my primary laptop happens... i was going to just have failure warning sms, but i was worried that if the failure warning sms failed, i wouldn't know. This way, I know every day that it's successful, and if I don't get a "backup failed" OR a  "backup success" message, I know that something has failed.
[00:53:35] <Psi-Jack> With borgbackup, you could write a script to check your borg list, verify that the latest exists, and alert if not.
[00:53:51] <Henry151> for example, when my twilio account's billing credit card expired and i forgot to update it, the twilio-sms stopped working, so i stopped receiving the "backup success" messages and was alerted that way. If I had it only notifying me on backup failures, I may have gone much longer without knowing that my twilio account needed a recharge.
[00:55:10] <Henry151> i'm pretty excited about finally setting up borgbackup. I'm using rsync.net. I've been eye-balling borg and rsync.net as a new backups solution for almost two years and finally got around to it this week.
[00:55:37] <Psi-Jack> heh nice.
[00:57:04] <Henry151> you can see how, even with the script checking borg list to alert me if the latest doesn't exist, if my twilio-sms stopped working (like due to a billing issue) I would never receive an alert SMS... where if I receive a daily verification that the backup was successful, i will be sure to notice if any part of the alert system or the backup itself fails

[01:00:09] <Psi-Jack> And of course, getting a re-playable package listing of the system so it could be rebuilt from a golden image with bare minimums to restore from.

[03:21:52] <e36freak> Psi-Jack: nice to see you outside of #linux :)
[03:22:23] <e36freak> i had to do a double take on the channel for a second
[03:22:41] <birkoff> is there something wrong comparing a number to a variable via == and not -eq ? 
[03:22:54] <birkoff> i.e. [[ "${var}" == 0 ]] 
[03:22:58] <e36freak> birkoff: in a [ or [[ command? possibly yes
[03:23:13] <e36freak> # var=00; [[ $var == 0 ]]; echo  $?
[03:23:15] <shbot> e36freak: 1
[03:23:18] <e36freak> # var=00; [[ $var -eq 0 ]]; echo  $?
[03:23:19] <shbot> e36freak: 0
[03:23:25] <birkoff> i see
[03:23:27] <e36freak> for example
[03:23:32] <e36freak> it's a string comparison, not a numeric
[03:23:40] <e36freak> i recommend using (( for numeric/arithmetic stuff anyway
[03:23:40] <Psi-Jack> e36freak: What?!? This isn't #linux? 
[03:23:43] <Psi-Jack> Crapo!  ðŸ™‚
[03:23:44] <e36freak> ((var == 0))
[03:24:03] <birkoff> but if i'm using the numbers 1 and 0 as boolean substitutes that should be alright ?
[03:24:14] <e36freak> i'd still use ((
[03:24:20] <geirha> !bool
[03:24:20] <greybot> Bash doesn't have boolean variables, but you can shanghai integers for this purpose, just like in C. first=1; errors=0; if ((first)); then ...; if ((! errors)); then ...; ((debug)) && log stuff
[03:24:22] <e36freak> ((bool)), ((!bool))
[03:25:28] <birkoff> what's the shanghai ? 
[03:25:44] <e36freak> it's uh
[03:26:15] <e36freak> it's an english idiom from back in the day when sailors would kidnap people to work on ships
[03:26:32] <e36freak> basically means temporarily kidnap/steal

[12:55:05] <geirha> because it forks first, then does the redirections
[12:55:14] <emanuele6> i always write $((++i)) and $((i++)) on a separate line as ((++i)) and ((i++)) because when i use $((++i))/$((i++)) it never works properly

[14:23:40] <stemid> hey I realize this is a stretch but is there some magic way in bash for a glob to only select one file out of several? like I have foo-20.zstd, foo-21.zstd, bar-20.zstd and so forth (simplified, they're really long date/time stamps). and I want to loop over many of these but only unpack one of each foo, bar. preferably the latest one based on its alphanumeric timestamp.
[14:24:04] <stemid> so the latest foo, the latest bar and so forth
[14:24:57] <stemid> or just one of each is enough. doesn't have to be the latest one.
[14:25:00] <Soliton> !latest
[14:25:00] <greybot> Find the latest modified file in a directory: latest() { local file latest; for file in "${1:-.}"/*; do [[ $file -nt $latest ]] && latest=$file; done; printf '%s\n' "$latest"; } ## Usage: latest [dir]
[14:25:02] <geirha> array=( foo-*.zstd ); and then use "${array[-1]}"
[14:25:13] <geirha> assuming the timestamps are sane
[14:25:26] <stemid> oh array! nice

[18:45:09] <emanuele6> { exec -a zeroth program ;} &
[18:45:25] <randomuser> Thanks!
[18:45:53] <Soliton> you only need the & if you want to run it in the background.
[18:46:00] <emanuele6> right
[18:46:16] <llua> without, rip
[18:46:21] <llua> without it*
[18:46:26] <emanuele6> exec -a zeroth program first second &
[18:47:57] <Soliton> maybe i missed a requirement.
[18:49:01] <llua> he is using & to get a subshell instead of using ()
[18:49:33] <Soliton> which only makes sense if you want to background the process.
[18:49:47] <emanuele6> oh, right, i got confused

[19:12:48] <pyzozord> is env simply a way here to "find and execute python3 in PATH"?
[19:13:19] <pyzozord> and if so, why not use `#!command python3` instead?
[19:13:27] <emanuele6> yes, because python3 might not be in path

[19:16:30] <emanuele6> pyzozord: you can run any program you want, but we assume `env(1)' will always be installed and in /bin in a UNIX system so we use it to find non-standard POSIX programs like bash or python 
[19:16:33] <Gamma> It's far more likely to exist than /usr/bin/python3
[19:16:35] <twkm> is is their guess as to where it is, yet somehow they have no idea where python3 is.
[19:16:35] <DevAntoine> I'm trying to test if a file exists using ash: https://gist.github.com/devantoine/eadd1a0f94b6f64f4c2b73b488ebe6cb
[19:16:51] <twkm> !check

[19:16:54] <DevAntoine> But I think ash doesn't like the "." in the filename
[19:17:18] <twkm> a period in a filename means nothing special to bash.
[19:18:04] <emanuele6> that's ash, which should be busybox's shell
[19:18:17] <DevAntoine> that's weird because I've got "source"

[19:18:26] <DevAntoine> yes it is busybox shell
[19:18:47] <twkm> DevAntoine: yet see the issues checkbot found.
[19:18:52] <DevAntoine> I think busybox implementation of (d)ash is not correct

[19:21:35] <emanuele6> -e and -a are synonymous 
[19:21:51] <DevAntoine> Gamma: I read -a was for file existence.
[19:22:13] <twkm> pyzozord: if you believe one thing is de facto then you read the docs that you believe most adhere to such that you'd also know why.

[21:59:55] <leftyfb> bah, sorry about that folks. Not sure how I would have lost my identify. The bouncer must have disconnected at some point. Sorry to bother you guys
[22:00:00] <greycat> oh geez, "b" doesn't show "q" on this network?
[22:00:12] <twkm> didn't on freenode either.
[22:01:00] <twkm> libera uses the same s/w as freenode used to use, so the same way of doing things ... mostly.
[22:01:00] <greycat> I could have sworn it did.  Maybe it changed at some point.
[22:01:50] <twkm> way back they were the same, +q were weird +b's, but then they split the two into different lists.  that's what persists on libera.
[22:02:06] <greycat> if I'm not mistaken, +q was originally implemented as +b with some special syntax character added somewhere, so "b" showed both of them...
[22:02:15] <twkm> exactly.
[22:02:28] <greycat> I guess I missed the memo about the change

[22:37:41] <twkm> they don't provide every thing it is possible to do.  but they present a pe, if the specific pe isn't suitable look for ones that are.
[22:38:09] <emg> for f in foo--*; do mv "$f" foo-bar-"${f#foo--}"; done     if you want to avoid bashisms or lear about other PEs
[22:38:13] <twkm> foo- at the beginning would be better using # 
[22:38:17] <tirnanog> you probably really mean "foo-bar-${f#foo--}" though.
[22:39:17] <emg> your example using ${f//foo--/foo-bar-} will repalce every single foo--  now most likely you only have it at the beginning, but it would repalce others, you can use the ${f#foo--} example or you can ${f/#foo--/foo-bar-/} to only replace at beginning

[23:37:41] <emg> "PROMPT_COMMAND may be an array"   well that's news to me
[23:38:24] <greycat> it's pretty new, and I don't think I've seen anyone actually use it yet
[23:38:50] <emg> tempted to use it, know it'll bite me when I end up on a computer with older bash

[23:40:30] <joo-_> well i'lll be damned
[23:41:22] <ormaaj> I figured `PROMPT_COMMAND=('history -a' 'history -n')` might be nice. It wasn't.

[23:56:38] <pj> still too new to be useful, imo.
[23:57:11] <greycat> I could imagine someone using it on a single system, with a local HOME.
[23:57:18] <pj> sure
[23:58:00] <pj> but for now if I needed multiple prompt commands I'd probably just stick them in a function and call the function from PROMPT_COMMAND
