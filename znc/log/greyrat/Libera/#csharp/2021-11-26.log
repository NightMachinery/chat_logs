[10:49:40] <Nasp> Ohh crap asian stock market havent responded well
[10:55:08] <jmer> Nasp: to mask mandates in DEnmark?
[10:56:13] <jmer> our scrum master posted info on a course on how to manage your energy levels in our Teams chat... I responded with this gif: https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriO04qxVReM5rJEA/giphy.gif
[10:56:46] <Nasp> jmer:  From monday in public ransport and shops
[10:57:01] <Nasp> Coffee and redpulls :D
[10:57:05] <jmer> Nasp: Yeah I mean, did the asian stock market react badly to mandated masks in Denmark? xD
[10:57:13] <Nasp> At former workplace we had an entire system coded on redbull
[10:57:16] <jmer> Nasp: redPulls?
[10:57:23] <Nasp> AHh no it just reacted badly in general
[10:57:33] <Nasp> And i'm affraid the danish and US marked will follow again
[10:57:40] <jmer> Is a redPull a Pull Request with code written under the influence of redbull?
[10:57:51] <Nasp> I remember one collegue showing up at 10 then 11, then 12
[10:57:57] <Nasp> Take two redbulls, sit down and drink them
[10:58:07] <Nasp> He came in a baaaad cycle and just got futher behind in his schedule
[10:58:13] <Nasp> Then he went home at 20
[10:58:17] <Nasp> He has 1.5 hours of transport
[10:58:36] <jmer> back when I had 1,5 hours of transport I had to get up at 5:00
[11:04:20] <jmer> Soo... I haven't used EF that much, but using the migrations for DB change is optional right?
[11:04:41] <jmer> I could just add the column in the DB, add the corresponding property on the DTO and then EF will generate the right SQL for it?
[11:04:50] <jmer> not for the change mind you, just the DML
[11:05:01] <gufi_> yes
[11:05:17] <gufi_> as long as you also have the configuration setup for said new property
[11:05:33] <jmer> gufi_: the thing using the modelbuilder stuff?
[11:06:19] <gufi_> yea
[11:06:48] <gufi_> column + add to builder configuration for db context + add to poco/dto/model/entity class and you're gtg
[11:07:03] <jmer> I think I will go with that then... The alternative is to replace EF with Dapper and set up FluentMigrator for migrations... but this is just a small tool that fetches som JSON and updates a DB with the new data...
[11:07:18] <gufi_> we use EF and fluent migrator
[11:07:19] <jmer> It might actually be overkill to use any kind of migrations for a DB with 4 tables
[11:07:21] <gufi_> no  need to  use dapper
[11:07:34] * gufi_ doesnt trust EF migrations, never have, never will
[11:07:34] <jmer> gufi_: in our case ALL othe projects use Dapper...
[11:07:39] <gufi_> ouch
[11:07:42] <gufi_> shitt
[11:07:42] <jmer> Nah man
[11:07:45] <jmer> Dapper is nice xD
[11:07:49] <gufi_> fuuuuck writing sql
[11:07:56] <jmer> That depends
[11:07:58] <gufi_> nope
[11:07:59] <gufi_> always
[11:08:03] <gufi_> last resort
[11:08:11] <jmer> You don't have to write SQL with Dapper
[11:08:11] <gufi_> and curse it the whole way down
[11:08:29] <gufi_> since when does it do generated sql?
[11:08:32] <jmer> that's the whole point, use extensions so all single table SQL can be generated and then only write the complex joins with SQL
[11:08:43] <gufi_> oh
[11:08:53] <gufi_> yea... nah i dont wanna  have to write sql just because i have a join
[11:09:43] <jmer> I said complex joins ^^
[11:09:48] <gufi_> ctx.Table.Where(x => x.someThing == SomeCondition).Select(x => new { x.table1Prop, x.Table2.SomeOtherProp}) done

[11:14:02] <jmer> the task I am currently working on at the moment seems OK except it's a bit overengineered, mediatr, EF migrations, UnitOfWork... All kinds of fancy patterns adding lots of extra layers for something that basically fetches JSON from a FTP and updates 3 different tables with that data
[11:15:20] <jmer> gufi_: well... I'm not disparaged, it seems people here are pretty decent at their job...

[11:15:56] <jmer> earthy: well this little, minor part, isn't 20 years old... But the rest of the codebase is xD
[11:16:15] <gufi_> yea... sounds... pretty typical . UOW/mediatr etc because "follow the pattern no matter how stupid"
[11:16:32] <jmer> I mean it was obviously written by someone who doesn't just write spaghetti code but he might've gone a bit overboard with the abstractions xD
[11:16:39] <gufi_> probably a IRepository on top of UOW while they're at it
[11:16:57] <earthy> gufi_: well, more because 'follow the pattern because that makes the entire codebase look similar and halps people get up to speed'
[11:17:16] <gufi_> i got forced into IRepository for the reason of "what if we swap databases"
[11:17:29] <gufi_> my argument was "EF is the IRepository pattern"
[11:17:38] <gufi_> got shot down =(
[11:17:40] <earthy> we even do repositories when we *don't* swap databases. :)
[11:17:55] <gufi_> i hate abstracting the ORM
[11:17:57] <gufi_> waste of fuckin time
[11:17:58] <Nasp> jmer:  Yes it's optional to use, like i said we use DbUp for migrations
[11:18:13] <jmer> I'm not per definition against any tech or pattern... I just like it when people think a little before just applying <whatever>
[11:18:27] <jmer> Nasp: not sure Migrations make sense in this instance.
[11:18:31] <gufi_> i'll accept abstractions with reason
[11:18:35] <jmer> It might if the database grows
[11:18:46] <gufi_> the "what if" shit never makes the cut for me to agree with
[11:18:59] <earthy> gufi_: yeah. well... I'm currently doing Java, and Java has standardised the ORM... even then there's value in repositories (in java), because Java doesn't have LINQ
[11:19:14] <gufi_> fuuuck java =)
[11:19:29] <Nasp> gufi_: i Also een if you abstract EF away, you can't never just switch out the DB
[11:19:36] <Nasp> jmer: EF migrations or at all?
[11:19:38] <gufi_> even javascript does a better job than it these days ( hard pill to swallow even for me )
[11:19:41] <Nasp> Also do oyu need zero downtime deploymentS?
[11:19:41] <jmer> Nasp: at all
[11:20:09] <gufi_> Nasp, the problem isee every  time with abstracting an orm is that the orm always leaks because you lose power
[11:20:16] <earthy> gufi_: agreed. then again... 20yo+ codebase still earning money.
[11:20:26] <gufi_> cant argue with money, i agree
[11:20:36] <gufi_> i'd do php if the money was right =D
[11:20:44] * gufi_ trades time and skill for money
[11:20:56] <earthy> I *tried* doing php for the right money... they wouldn't have me. :)
[11:21:02] <earthy> (their loss)
[11:21:04] <jmer> I just bought a house, I'll trade almost anything for money!
[11:21:36] <gufi_> i did 2  years ago... know those feels... i've been paying off CCs to catch up with purchase of shit + wife lost job last year ( were good now but gotta recover )
[11:21:37] <Nasp> jmer: Well you need to apply migrations at some point right
[11:21:44] <Nasp> Unless tthe database is never going to change
[11:22:00] <jmer> Nasp: Obviously this  database has changed very little over the past years
[11:22:15] <gufi_> Nasp, nah, just put in  ticket for devops to run sql against prod, nbd
[11:22:15] <Nasp> Was it a hosted servicve or some on prem?
[11:22:16] <jmer> and by very little I mean... nobody has touched this code for over a year and only external influence is making us change this
[11:22:49] <jmer> It's hosted by us, but I actually don't know where.
[11:23:25] <bomb> nobody has touched _THIS_ for over a decade, jmer
[11:23:27] <Nasp> Well then you probaly dont need to focus on migrations right now
[11:23:38] <bomb> I'm desperate.
[11:24:52] <jmer> Nasp: I will create a task in the backlog for us to get this data layer fixed properly, but other parts of the org is waiting for this change so I think the prudent choice is to prioritize speed to deliver something NOW and then we can polish it when there are nobody waiting for the actual funcitonality
[11:25:26] <jmer> bomb: sorry I don't swing that way
[11:25:58] <gufi_> _THIS_.bind(self); fixed it for you bomb
[11:26:20] <bomb> lol
[11:27:41] <Nasp> jmer:  Well so how is migrations done now, manuallky or just never?
[11:27:44] <Nasp> Because then you aren't any worse
[11:28:00] <Nasp> And if you then need to make more changes to the system then prioritize adding migrations, either EF or DbUp or whatever
[11:28:44] <jmer> Nasp: they're broken
[11:29:02] <jmer> Nasp: the ModelSnapshot is out of sync with the actual database so the migrations that is in here, doesn't work
[11:29:47] <gufi_> first line of migration: delete from migrations;
[11:29:59] <gufi_> ^ fixed it
[11:30:02] <jmer> gufi_: huh?
[11:30:15] * gufi_ was assuming there was a hash table for the migrations if they existed
[11:30:21] <jmer> this is EFCore
[11:30:34] <jmer> it uses the ModelDbCOntextSnapShot thing... (I probably got that wrong)
[11:30:50] <gufi_> yea, if that table is empty it will just rerun all migrations
[11:31:19] <gufi_> may or may notbe safe depending on where the migrations start  from though =)

[11:33:06] <jmer> so the migrations fail because it's trying to make columns that are allready set as nullable, nullable
[11:33:48] <gufi_> weird...  should be doing a compare for that stuff
[11:34:03] <jmer> well it's comparing to the broken ModelSnapshot that sees them as not nullable

[11:38:51] <jmer> gufi_: Yeah I considdered that, but in terms of having feature flags that does changes to the DB I thought having the change management in C# code would be better.
[11:39:14] <jmer> Disclaimer; I have no idea if feature flags that change the DB is good or bad practice
[11:47:48] <Nasp> Feature glags?
[11:47:56] <Nasp> What does that have to do with EF  migrations
[11:48:20] <jmer> Nasp: That comment was targeted at gufi_ mentioning SQL Data Tools.
[11:48:28] <Nasp> ah
[11:48:40] <Nasp> Anyway sounds like you should just ignore it for now
[11:48:52] <Nasp> But sounds like there is some technical debt there regarding having the schema in sync
[11:49:04] <jmer> Nasp: well I look again and there are several tables in the DB not represented in this EF setup that is code first... soooo... yeah xD
[11:49:18] <jmer> If we keep EF it should be DB first.
[11:49:30] <Nasp> We have many tables in the db that isn't in EF
[11:49:40] <jmer> But as I said; I'm going with the quick fix ignoring those migrations and then we will have to revisit this
[11:49:40] <Nasp> People delete them because they should no longer be used, but the cleanup isn't completely done
[11:49:44] <Nasp> I think we have 20 or so of those tables
[11:49:51] <Nasp> Then 4 years later, do you dare actually deleting such table?
[11:49:56] <jmer> lol
[11:50:03] <jmer> I'm fairly sure these tables are in use
[11:50:11] <jmer> but maybe not from this particular .sln
[11:51:05] <Nasp> I just dont like leaving stuff in
[11:51:11] <Nasp> Because years later you just have so much extra work
[11:51:17] <jmer> this won't be years later
[11:51:31] <jmer> right now there's a rough focus of 80% on technical debt and 20% feature development
[11:51:54] <jmer> because the POs we have know the importance of paying off the technical debt

[12:53:44] <MatthiasVance> At least I did the right thing :)
[12:54:56] <bomb> your "you fucking pay me tomorrow, or I will break into your home when you sleep, and send your family to heaven" reply?
[12:56:14] <MatthiasVance> I can't confirm or deny that
[12:56:38] <MatthiasVance> Well actually, no it was a very professional reply :D
[12:57:18] <Nasp> Strange to see a food company delivering 20 pallets of goods to a company i know is about to go bankrupt
[13:07:28] <MatthiasVance> They hide that in their homes and then not pay the bills :D
[13:07:33] <MatthiasVance> idk, stuff like that happens sometimes
[13:09:06] <MatthiasVance> Hmmm the sweet taste of metal
[13:09:15] <MatthiasVance> Fucking antibiotics :D
[13:09:18] <Nasp> I think they are getting as much delivered so they can sell it for easy cash
[13:09:25] <MatthiasVance> ahh that could be the case too
[13:09:35] <Nasp> The bailiffs are coming next week
[13:09:49] <Nasp> And it's already their "company - 2"
[13:09:52] <Nasp> It's so easy to go around
[13:09:59] <MatthiasVance> What do you mean with that?
[13:10:09] <Nasp> you have company name - 1
[13:10:12] <Nasp> It goes bankrupt
[13:10:14] <Nasp> What do you do?
[13:10:18] <Nasp> Start company name - 2
[13:10:33] <MatthiasVance> ah
[13:10:58] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: What do you think about that? You seem to lean on the "that's a bad thing" side
[13:11:09] <Nasp> It is a bad thing
[13:11:19] <Nasp> It's fraud
[13:11:37] <MatthiasVance> Starting a new company is fraud?
[13:11:41] <MatthiasVance> Or in this particular case?
[13:11:56] <MatthiasVance> If my business goes bankrupt I would definitely want to start another ..
[13:12:40] <Nasp> Yes but they start it imediatly, sell all remaining stock for 1 euro to the new compoany
[13:12:43] <Nasp> Then rinse and repeat
[13:12:45] <Nasp> Isn't that fraud?
[13:12:54] <Nasp> Else why ever pay bills
[13:13:27] <MatthiasVance> I am not sure what the law says on that
[13:14:22] <MatthiasVance> Because if it's *allowed*, why *not* do that
[13:14:35] <Nasp> Usually not, but it takes years for courts to keep up
[13:14:48] <Nasp> They also resell their contracts which i've never understood how they can
[13:15:05] <MatthiasVance> So basically they take out everything they can from #1 to move it to #2
[13:15:31] <MatthiasVance> I'm trying to come up with the dutch term for that so I can look it up :D
[13:15:48] <MatthiasVance> I mean I know what "bankrupt" is in dutch but that's not what we use :D
[13:16:07] <Nasp> Like they leave behind a ton of debt
[13:16:08] <MatthiasVance> ah, got it
[13:16:15] <MatthiasVance> yeah I know what you mean now Nasp
[13:16:20] <Nasp> But what i dont understand is how companies that deliveries good doesn't want money up front
[13:16:36] <Nasp> It's not like they went just "bankrupt" by accident
[13:16:46] <Nasp> And then actually try again for real
[13:19:05] <MatthiasVance> Here our tax agency says that if you start a new company creditors will most likely just go after you to get you to pay their debts :D
[13:19:53] <MatthiasVance> You are allowed to sell off stuff from your failed company to someone else though
[13:20:12] <MatthiasVance> But that's of course a little different if you own the new company :D

[16:07:31] <Nasp> Wasn't new worlds free?
[16:07:59] <irwiss> Nasp: i mean, if you don't fuck up your enum ordering by not specifying explicit values it won't fuck up, but either you use json for human readability... or why are you using json in the first place, cause as a format it sucks major ass in both performance and payload size
[16:08:17] <Nasp> Yeah performance isn't an issue
[16:08:21] <Nasp> Then i wouldn't use json at all
[16:08:36] <Nasp> And with fuckup i just mean when some of our system starts talking together with it as ints and others as strings
[16:08:44] <Nasp> Wouldn't it be best they all do  the same
[16:09:43] <irwiss> yep and if it is for human readability then you better use readable enum values, cause "stateOfTheNation: 3" WILL require you to dig that shit up to know wtf 3 means
[16:09:55] <Nasp> Yep
[16:13:06] <Nasp> Hmm the reason is it needs to be shown as ints some place

[17:35:08] <littlebit> to elaborate
[17:35:10] <canton7> Again, what do you mean by "summing up" a list of string?
[17:35:11] <jbe> the amount of them or concatenating the strings?
[17:35:26] <canton7> What's the sum of `{ "foo", "bar", "baz" }`?
[17:35:46] <littlebit> that would be 3
[17:35:51] <canton7> So the number of strings?
[17:36:01] <canton7> Not anything to do with their contents or length?
[17:36:02] <littlebit> yes thank you for making that point clear
[17:36:10] <littlebit> not their
[17:36:12] <littlebit> length
[17:36:25] <canton7> so dict[key].Sum(x => x.Count) ?

[21:03:27] <blez> I bought macbook air m1
[21:03:40] <blez> VS 2022, on Win11 ARM sucks
[21:03:46] <bpmedley> blez : Cool!!  What specs did you get?
[21:03:53] <blez> almost unusable
[21:04:00] <blez> 16gb ram, 256gb
[21:04:18] <bpmedley> Nice.  Are you running VS 2022 in Parallels?
[21:04:30] <blez> strangely, everything else, except VS2022 works nice, even games (in Parallels)
[21:04:32] <blez> yes
[21:04:42] <Nasp> blez:  Have you tried it on the new M1?
[21:04:49] <bpmedley> Do you feel that VS2022 will get better over time?
[21:05:06] <blez> Nasp yes
[21:05:13] <Nasp> 2022 is about as bad as 2019
[21:05:24] <Nasp> blez:  Was it VS or Windows that ran horribly?
[21:05:25] <blez> Win11 ARM works flawlessly, the problem is with VS, lags a lot
[21:05:58] <bomb> isnt that the case on Win11 on x86
[21:06:09] <Nasp> It lags on x86 as well
[21:06:15] <bomb> yea
[21:06:15] <Suchiman> blez: jokes on you, you didn't buy the M1 MAX
[21:06:31] <blez> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad39jwkBLnk& this guy shows it
[21:06:41] <Suchiman> blez: also jokes on you for buying mac xD
[21:06:43] <blez> Suchiman tbh, the overall thing is awesome, but I'm not used to macos
[21:07:00] <Nasp> Did you run it like that
[21:07:01] <blez> battery life is _at least_ 9 hours
[21:07:02] <Nasp> In a VM?
[21:07:20] <blez> Nasp currently there is no way to run windows except Parallels, no Bootcamp

[21:08:07] <bpmedley> blez : Sounds like the new Apple's are a win, then.  Do you use the Terminal much?

[21:09:24] <blez> I just wanted the best battery life
[21:10:00] <blez> (and no fans)
[21:11:16] <blez> installed parallels, windows 11, vs2022, unreal 3 tournament, played 10 minutes unreal => battery -10%

[21:15:17] <blez> can't try it right now, cause I'm using my pc
[21:15:38] <blez> but macos's UX is weird. Especially the window management
[21:16:30] <bpmedley> blez : Understood.  When you get some time, let me show you a few useful bash/zsh Terminal commands and constructs..
[21:16:47] <bpmedley> I do agree that macOS differs quite a bit from Windows.
[21:17:02] <blez> bpmedley I'll ping you tomorrow for that
[21:17:13] <blez> yea, I know many people like it. But I still don't know why :D
[21:17:29] <Suchiman> blez: that's like 100 minutes of gameplay, not at least 9hours :P
[21:17:44] <blez> at least I can't work fast on it. Every keyboard shortcut is different
[21:18:43] <blez> Edge works so much better than Safari on Mac :D
[21:19:26] <blez> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZR0nzAsYGw - that's also interesting - .NET and M1
[21:20:01] <Suchiman> blez: and UT3 has low sys requirements, i'm not very impressed by 1% battery drain a minute
[21:20:12] <bomb> Unreal Tournament 3
[21:20:30] <blez> Suchiman I'll get my laptop tomorrow and I can test it again
[21:20:48] <blez> and btw I'm talking about max settings 2560x1600
[21:21:33] <bomb> wait you're actually talking about Unreal lol
[21:21:37] <blez> >but can it run crysis
[21:21:56] <Suchiman> blez: can it run Crysis Remastered!
[21:22:00] <blez> I bet!
[21:22:04] <Suchiman> ;o
[21:22:20] <blez> I'll try it tomorrow with MK10 and MK11 in Parallels
[21:23:15] <blez> and I'll have to try VS2019, cause VS2022 is unusable
[21:24:29] <blez> I wish my surface laptop 3 had such battery life :/

[22:01:25] <gegagome> I am building a metronome-like game in Unity and wanted to know if playing the click on update (_frequency =  SIXTY_SECONDS / _bpm;) for example at 120bpm is better than using a coroutine like WaitForSeconds(0.5f);
[22:03:40] <bomb> THREAD my friend, you want a separate thread for your metronome
[22:04:21] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4c54rCJ_k
[22:08:09] <gegagome> can you please explain why a thread works better?
[22:08:29] <DevJohnC> it operates independent of any other events/processes in your app
[22:08:42] <DevJohnC> so it can't drift/miss beats due to not getting scheduled in a timely manner
[22:10:41] <gegagome> cool, I'll def be doing that
[22:10:54] <gegagome> as far as like the frequency algorithm
[22:11:17] <gegagome> is it better to use unity's update loop or coroutine
[22:11:34] <gegagome> I think coroutines would work better
[22:11:46] <gegagome> but I am not sure what others think
[22:17:16] <Nasp> I would be surprised if unity didn't have something built in that's prefered to use
[22:17:42] <BtbN> A thread very much can miss beats. It's still a slave to the scheduler.
[22:18:08] <bomb> Nasp OMICRON VARIANT!
[22:18:58] <bomb> gegagome I'd examine how rhythm games are done in Unity
