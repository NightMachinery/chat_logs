[06:56:39] <kepstin> there's sufficient tuning available on all three of the encoders that it's really hard to say. I have not done any analysis on how speed compares between them when configured to approximately match in video encoding efficiency (if that's even possible)
[06:57:53] <kepstin> all i know is that when i tried it i was unable to get a satisfactory result from libaom trying to adjusting options to increase speed, and svt is still slow, but more usable.
[06:58:06] <kepstin> i don't have personal experience with rav1e
[06:58:34] <kode54> rav1e supports tiling too, but requires a different option syntax to use it
[06:59:00] <kode54> and the results aren't too stunning if you follow the ffmpeg manual and give it 500kbps
[06:59:03] <lumberjack123> kode54: I am unfamiliar with tiling, does this speed up encoding somehow?
[06:59:16] <kode54> if you don't tile, you can only use a single CPU core to encode
[06:59:24] <patricia> how to run ffmpeg with srs
[06:59:54] <lumberjack123> kode54: Does that mean libaom-av1 and libsvtav1 are limited to a single core because they do not support tiling?
[07:00:02] <kode54> they do support tiling
[07:00:23] <lumberjack123> kode54: Okay so all 3 encoders support tiling and therefore can use all cores?
[07:00:23] <kode54> but the syntax is different depending on which implementation you use
[07:00:41] <kode54> SVT is also the only one that's likely to require a huge amount of RAM to work
[07:01:04] <kode54> like, 2GB of RAM to encode 1080p video, or 7GB to encode 2160p
[07:01:24] <lumberjack123> kode54: okay thank you for this info but RAM use is not as important as encoding speed
[07:01:41] <kode54> none of them have near real time performance
[07:01:54] <kode54> so expect your encodes to take many times longer than they do to play back
[07:02:30] <lumberjack123> kode54: I see okay I was just suggesting someone try AV1 over H.265 and they were disappointed with encoding speeds so not sure what to say
[07:03:03] <kode54> I know someone disappointed enough with x265 encoding speeds to use a hardware encoder instead
[07:04:19] <lumberjack123> kode54: Hmm they say they get these stats: x265

[07:04:51] <lumberjack123> I have not researched hardware encoders for H.265 or AV1
[07:06:10] <kepstin> without any knowledge of what options they used, those numbers are meaningless :/
[07:08:38] <kepstin> one thing that makes researching hardware av1 encoders easier is that there aren't any :)

[07:15:57] <lumberjack123> kepstin: Okay for x265:  ffmpeg -y -i "$1" -preset ultrafast -acodec
[07:16:04] <lumberjack123> copy -vcodec libx265 "sd265_$FILE"
[07:16:12] <lumberjack123> (sorry 2 lines >_<)
[07:16:27] <lumberjack123> fmpeg -y -i "$1" -preset ultrafast -crf 28    -b:v 0 -movflags +faststart -acodec copy -vcodec libaom-av1 "av1_$FILE"
[07:16:32] <lumberjack123> That is for AV1 ^
[07:17:11] <kepstin> ok, so they're using ultrafast on x264 and invalid options that are ignored on av1, no attempt to match quality or bitrate
[07:18:07] <kepstin> er, i think.
[07:18:13] <kepstin> hmm, i need to check a parameter reference
[07:18:31] <kepstin> what's the use case, anyways? it's pretty rare to use ultrafast with x265

[07:19:37] <kepstin> (it's been a while since i checked, but iirc ultrafast on x265 brings its quality down such that it's competing with some of the midrange x264 settings)

[07:23:25] <kepstin> right, libaom-av1 doesn't use the preset option, it has a different syntax for configuring speed/quality tradeoff. and i think you might need additional options to better use multithreading.
[07:24:18] <kepstin> or maybe it's been so long and the speed tradeoff option changed since i last looked? :/
[07:24:36] <lumberjack123> kepstin: they have like 50 home videos apparently MP4 files (I guess this just says the extension) and they are trying to transcode them... does that answer your question about "use case"?
[07:25:02] <kepstin> not really, it's missing the "why?"
[07:25:33] <kepstin> you generally want to avoid lossy transcodes where possible to avoid generation loss
[07:25:51] <kepstin> and if you're trying to minimize storage space used for archiving, you'd prefer slow encoder options
[07:26:56] <kepstin> re-encoding an h264 file with x265 with ultrafast option will be marginally better, maybe, but depending on other settings could make the videos noticably worse without much decrease in filesize :(
[07:28:04] <kepstin> (of course, if the original files were e.g. straight off a camera, then re-encoding can make them quite a bit smaller without noticable quality loss, since hardware video encoders in cameras are really inefficient)

[07:35:32] <lumberjack123> kepstin: Apparently these MP4 files were recorded on a smartphone camera, and they are archiving the originals, but they want smaller encodes to store on the smartphone for playback... does that help give more info?
[07:36:31] <kepstin> yeah, that explains quite a lot.
[07:37:17] <kepstin> I'd personally probably end up using x264 for that sort of thing, since it's fast, good enough, and is guaranteed to be supported by the phone's hardware video decoder.
[07:37:46] <kepstin> (depending on the phone model, h265 might also work, and some android devices can do vp9)
[07:37:59] <kepstin> i wouldn't consider av1 for that use case at all right now.
[07:39:12] <kepstin> (do you know the original codec the videos are in? that might identify what the phone could be expected to support)

[13:46:17] <Enverex> Hi. I'm trying to bulk convert some of my archived films but because they were from Blu-Rays, I'm having some issues, specififically with pcm_bluray as FFMPEG doesn't even seem to be able to copy it (which is weird, I'm not asking it to encode it). So I can obviously do a manual reencode to FLAC for example, but I've got a dozen or so I need to do
[13:46:17] <Enverex> and wanted to keep all the streams (other audio channels, subtitles, etc) intact which would require me to manually map every single stream which would take forever. TL;DR: Is there a way to auto-reencode JUST pcm_bluray and copy all other streams, without specifying them all manually?

[13:51:50] <JEEB> ok, so fixes towards handling copying blu-ray pcm to mpeg-ts wouldn't help you :)
[13:52:30] <JEEB> in that case unfortunately it sounds like ffprobe -of json -show_streams -i INPUT and scripting would probably be the least problematic way of automating that
[13:54:06] <Enverex> Oh god, I'd hoped that wasn't the case but kinda expected that to be what I'd need to do. Ah well, thanks for confirming at least.
[13:54:41] <JEEB> ffmpeg.c can't fit every use case, unfortunately :)

[13:57:06] <Enverex> A "skip unusable streams" option would be nice, so that it doesn't outright fail.

[14:13:26] <Enverex> You can specify mapping with -map 0:a:X for specific streams or all audio streams with -map 0:a but is there a way to do the inverse of the first and exclude a channel? So basically 0:a minus one that's been specified? I'm guessing not as that's rather niche.

[18:15:04] <chicken_tendies> I am currently using the following command.
[18:15:05] <chicken_tendies> ffmpeg -i rtsp://foo/bar -vcodec copy -segment_time 00:60:00 -segment_list stream.m3u8
[18:15:05] <chicken_tendies> -segment_list_flags +live -f segment stream_%05d.mp4
[18:15:06] <chicken_tendies> Using -vcodec copy ends up taking a massive amount of disk space(the incoming stream is HD) and I want to compress it using libx264 or libx265
[18:15:06] <chicken_tendies> Another constraint that I have is of compute power. So I wish ffmpeg to use only 1 thread for each stream and I am doing that by using -threads 1 and -c:v libx264 -x264-params threads=1 .
[18:15:07] <chicken_tendies> Is this the right approach?
[18:15:07] <chicken_tendies> I am getting tons of frame loss in between and warnings such as
[18:15:08] <chicken_tendies> NULL @ 0x557fde2a6a80] Invalid NAL unit 0, skipping.
[18:15:08] <chicken_tendies> [hevc @ 0x557fde35a440] Could not find ref with POC 49
[18:15:09] <chicken_tendies> and
[18:15:10] <chicken_tendies> [hevc @ 0x557fde35a440] The cu_qp_delta 28 is outside the valid range [-26, 25]
[18:19:29] <patricia> some one can help me ?
[18:20:19] <patricia> i use ffmpeg  -f avfoundation -s 640x360 -framerate 30 -i "0:none"  -pixel_format bgr0 -preset ultrafast -c:v libx264  -tune zerolatency  -b:v 600k -s 1280x720 -r 25 -f flv  rtmp://localhost:20000/live/livestream/video. to broadcast with srs
[18:20:25] <patricia> it works
[18:20:54] <patricia> but no not can be view on smartphone
[18:21:46] <patricia> some one can help me ?
