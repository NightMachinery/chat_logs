[00:00:23] <meator> Hello. Why toggling the backlight of my usb keyboard via scroll lock doesn't work in Linux but does work in GRUB?

[00:08:43] <hexnewbie> Mounting EFI at /boot is an odd practice, I mean, putting random files (kernels) in the root of the EFI system partitions sounds highly irregular. What if Windows decides to name its bootloader 'vmlinuz-5.10.0-11-amd64' tomorrow? 😃

I installed a bunch of gnome packages trying to get redlight-gtk to work, I don't know if maybe that also installed a firewall which is locking me out, or what.  I have the port forwarded.

[03:22:33] <ayecee> time to re-evaluate the assumptions
[03:23:16] <ayecee> some assumptions here are that the ip address is correct, that the port forwarding is functioning, and that there's no outbound firewall on windows.
[03:23:34] <ayecee> also that there's no other firewalls in between that would block it.

[03:49:54] <kurahaupo> Each network interface has a fixed MAC address stamped into it at the factory. That's taken from a pool allocated to the manufacturer, to ensure that such addresses are unique. All such MACs have '0' in that bit. The alternative is to generate a private-use MAC on the fly, probe the network to confirm it's not in use, and then proceed with normal networking. Those MACs must always have '1' in that bit.

[05:47:32] <kurahaupo> Sauvin: Almost all programmers use return-oriented programming. Jump-oriented is for things like state machines, without subroutine calls
[05:47:37] <ayecee> frostysword[m]: i think the answer to your question is "nobody here knows"
[05:47:39] <rabbit-> oh wait
[05:47:54] <tomreyn> 5.14 seems to have the patches, not sure whether that's all they're needed. gcc and binutils also need support, but this seems to have happened also
[05:47:55] <rabbit-> oh ye it is
[05:48:00] <rabbit-> not sure wat kurahaupo talking about
[05:48:03] <kurahaupo> But some call+return combinations can be optimized to a jump by the compiler
[05:48:18] <tomreyn> https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/147/attachments/72/83/CET-LPC-2018.pdf
[05:48:53] <kurahaupo> It's also possible to fake "jump oriented" programming by mangling the return address on the stack, and then going "return"; THAT is a common technique used by malware
[05:49:18] <Sauvin> So, we're talking about CPU having no JMP instruction?
[05:49:44] <ayecee> straight line performance for the win
[05:49:52] <kurahaupo> Sauvin: we're talking about not having full control over the CPU instruction sequence
[05:50:06] <kurahaupo> JMP will always be faster than CALL
[05:50:27] <frostysword[m]> ^^
[05:50:32] <kurahaupo> It's exceedingly unlikely that a CPU would ever be built that has CALL but not JMP (or equivalently, BRANCH)
[05:50:39] <Sauvin> That follows, because there's no return address to contend with.

[07:46:10] <perkinsms> dunno
[07:46:25] <Elw3> I see your problem, usb cables generally get faulty over 5m lenght.
[07:46:44] <perkinsms> lol of course
[07:47:23] <perkinsms> ok I see the device - should be able to map things to keys using joy2key

[07:48:08] <Dagmar> They're not specced to be made longer than that
[07:48:35] <perkinsms> this is more like 5,000,000m
[07:48:38] <perkinsms> so a bit longer
[07:48:45] <Dagmar> Copper is a good conductor, but unless you want a USB cable that looks like an industrial NEMA cable, it has to stay 5M or less
[07:49:35] <Dagmar> perkinsms: To answer the unasked question, when you plug in a USB device if the kernel recognizes it, it will load the relevant driver right then and there.  No need to reboot

[13:31:56] <hexnewbie> senoraraton: 1) Writing an ISO to a partition never does anything good (hybrid ISOs contain a compatibility partition table + an ISO, both supposed to go to a *whole disk*), 2) Writing any image to a mounted block device might result in a *hard crash* and *fatal corruption to whatever you wrote*, since the kernel (mount) and dd are competitive writing to the same device, 3) ISOs are read-only

[14:15:41] <jim> I've thought they could add a small tool that figures sizes
[14:15:49] <hexnewbie> euouae: No, they should ideally be equal, but since that confuses software, the logical one is perpetually stuck at 512. So instead stuff is aligned to multiple sectors.

[14:59:11] <euouae> I just read its man page, it looks fine to me
[14:59:11] <MrElendig> it confuses partititon types and filesystems, pretend to have filesystem operations it no longer supports etc
[15:01:24] <MrElendig> gptfdisk is much more straight forward
[15:02:26] <euouae> OK It's not fair to call it bad because of confusing UI
[15:02:37] <euouae> in any case, the operations seem simple so there isn't much to it
[15:02:40] <MrElendig> it is fair
[15:02:54] <euouae> bad would mean unusable to me

[15:14:19] <euouae> is what what you are saying? because the info page does not mention these things
[15:14:38] <MrElendig> its bad for ms-dos tables too because mkpart only accepts "primary, extended, logical"
[15:15:15] <euouae> hmmm.... fine. I was just warming up to parted. I guess I'll use fdisk. I don't think missing features is acceptable, especially for gpt

[20:52:48] <hexnewbie> structoha: While the only place where OpenVPN differentiates client and server is the certificate verification, typically the server will be the one to push routes and forward traffic to other machines, and clients would barely connect themselves, so only filter INPUT.
[20:52:55] <ayecee> ok then something is using that space and then freeing that space

[23:11:45] <frostysword[m]> but cmon I got openstack!
[23:11:48] <Dagmar> labrador: There's _lots_ of that going on, for reals
[23:12:15] <domicron> frostysword[m], thats a simplistic view. Scale matters. Cloud is someone elses datacenter filled with infrastructure ready for you to lease on demand.
[23:12:44] <Dagmar> Figuring out how to gracefully transition things to the cloud is pretty much where things come down to expertise and know-how, or dismal failure

[23:15:56] <colo> domicron, that's a cute view, until your grand almighty cloud provider fails your API request and tells you that you cannot provision any more instances of size $x, due to current demand ;)

[23:18:39] <domicron> are you guys just trying to pick faults with cloud because you're old bare metal guys that are refusing to adapt? I wonder....
[23:19:06] <colo> domicron, "multi-cloud" is a racket that consulting firms sell you. you EITHER go all-in on a single cloud vendor and consume their managed services, OR you don't "go cloud" at all.
[23:19:20] <domicron> own-cloud is also an option, except its prohibitively expensive

[23:19:27] <Dagmar> Too right
[23:19:42] <domicron> colo, i work for a multi-cloud consumer
[23:19:47] <Dagmar> "multi-cloud" is just a fancy way of saying "Give us some of the money you're giving those other people because we want some"

[23:20:04] <domicron> colo, we can stand down one supplier fairly rapidly
[23:20:17] <Dagmar> ...although at a certain scale "multi-cloud" just becomes anotehr form of redundancy
[23:20:18] <domicron> we actually have tested that lol
[23:20:18] <colo> of course, the European banking sector is royally fucked, because regulatory requirements force all of them to develop "multi-cloud strategies"
[23:20:39] <colo> domicron, that's good  for you, but it only tells me that your applications and workloads have to be pretty trivial

[23:21:13] <domicron> colo, they're not - but we have put a fair bit of effort into modularity. Still alot of work to do in that though
[23:21:27] <Dagmar> Usually "sea changes" in banking technology only happen when governments order it.
