[10:04:49] <ecraven> wow, now I didn't see this total self-destruction coming on Freenode (though I am no longer connected, so just read about it)..

[11:41:06] <wasamasa> I have to thank them for making it this obvious to migrate
[11:44:19] <irek> well said, its like official message for those who hesitated
[12:23:34] <ecraven> from a philosophical standpoint I'd be interested in the *reasons* for all this... why would anyone think this entire sequence of events is useful?
[12:23:40] <wasamasa> well
[12:23:46] <wasamasa> it might involve cocaine
[12:24:50] <wasamasa> I wish I was kidding: https://corrupt.tech/1708590130-ocr-compressed.pdf
[12:25:42] <wasamasa> I mean, I don't want to blame cocaine for freenode's downfall

[13:05:48] <wasamasa> more cocaine evidence
[13:06:02] <wasamasa> <@rasengan> JohnMH: Within 48 hours, it will be clear.
[13:06:04] <wasamasa> well then
[13:07:37] <wasamasa> > Some say that Freenode was intentionally destroyed for a tax writeoff. This was done after it was realized that Freenode had no hope left. That happened after all major channels with 1000+ users had already moved to Libera.
[13:07:48] <wasamasa> ecraven: stop attributing sense to everything
[13:08:06] <wasamasa> while one could retrospectively say it did make some sense, that's not necessarily what motivated it

[19:38:43] <jgkamat> tax writeoff what
[19:39:06] <jgkamat> maybe I should be more well versed in tax law :(
[19:39:47] <bremner> o.O?
[19:40:05] <jgkamat> but just going off of what rasengan has said himself cocane makes the most sense
[19:41:03] <bremner> did you maybe mean these comments for ##freenode?
[19:45:55] <jgkamat> literally any of it, even just the blog posts on the website lol
[19:46:37] <bremner> jgkamat: you are aware this is #emacs-circe, right?
[19:46:52] <jgkamat> yeah, I was just continuing the conversation from last night, sorry
[19:47:01] <bremner> OK.
