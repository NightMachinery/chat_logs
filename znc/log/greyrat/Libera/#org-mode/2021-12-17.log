[00:04:19] <Demosthenex> hmw: it imports ics files into my agenda :P
[00:04:30] <Demosthenex> gnus has ics ability, and then you can use it to add an ics file to org
[00:09:03] <hmw> I use icalendar-import-* and then c&p the result into Org. It's a bit annoying ;).
[00:09:55] <hmw> On the other hand, I only have to use it every few months or so
[00:11:43] <Demosthenex> yeah, i get ics all the time
[00:11:45] <Demosthenex> justa sec
[00:12:31] <Demosthenex> https://dpaste.org/SSVt
[00:12:48] <asus> Demosthenex, when you book an appointment at the dentist, and he tells you i.e. to remember to take your mask, would you put the information in an Org drawer ?
[00:12:48] <Demosthenex> that lets me use gnus to process the ical from a file and append it via capture to agenda.org
[00:13:04] <Demosthenex> asus: i'd write down anything important as the body under the heading, yes
[00:13:07] <hmw> The exchange people don't talk too much to me, so luckily I don't get too many invitations from them ;)
[00:13:19] <Demosthenex> asus: headings are not data, headings are metadata about the body contents
[00:13:54] <Demosthenex> asus: many of my headings are 1-2 words :P i know what they are by context in the hierarchy
[00:15:24] <asus> I see, but how do you organize the dentist address, phone number, objects (mask), etc ? Do you just throw them in the body ? Do you crete sub headlines, or drawers ?
[00:16:39] <Demosthenex> so, maybe i have a list of things i need to bring wiht me to the dentist.
[00:16:56] <Demosthenex> if its a simple list, i'd make a plain list with each item a checkbox below in the body under the heading
[00:17:24] <Demosthenex> address and phone, well, that's up to you. i have a contacts.org, and sometimes i'll put a vendor right under the heading for something with them
[00:17:47] <asus> a... vendor ?
[00:17:56] <Demosthenex> i'm just saying remember, the header is just like a folder, or a crease in a page. it doesn't matter much compared to what you write on the page.
[00:18:30] <pjb> Demosthenex: that's because you don't have a neuralink-based X-change service.
[00:18:35] <Demosthenex> so of course i'd take notes about the dentist in the body of that heading
[00:18:48] <Demosthenex> pjb: exactly. elon musk can stay outta my head
[00:18:51] <hmw> Ah, interesting (the capture template)
[00:19:01] <Demosthenex> hmw: i got that somewhere, i didn't write it
[00:19:12] <asus> by "folder" I mean org folder, like :ADDRESS: bla bla bla :END:
[00:19:26] <Demosthenex> hmw: but i can open an ics attachment in mutt, it calls mailcap, which calls emacsclient to run my function and pass the filename, it adds it automatically
[00:19:32] <Demosthenex> asus: i don't use property drawers often
[00:19:34] <pjb> Demosthenex: why?  Two great applications; Surrogates and X-changes.  You can send somebody to the dentist with your body, while you stay at work with his!
[00:19:55] <Demosthenex> asus: only when i want to emulate a mini database in my org notes
[00:19:59] *** Quits: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:20:04] <Demosthenex> asus: most of my notes are freehand, not drawers
[00:20:09] <pjb> With surrogates, you can avoid having to go to work, just send your surrogate, and let the dentist send his surrogate to your home.
[00:20:22] <Demosthenex> pjb: wow. incredible. sudo -k dentist!
[00:20:42] <Demosthenex> asus: i think  you're really overthinking it. practically, you just need to write it down
[00:20:54] <pjb> That said those movies are from 2000 (X Change) and 2008 (Surrogates) alreadyâ€¦
[00:21:16] <Demosthenex> pjb: i'll take the red pill
[00:21:51] <Demosthenex> asus: the only time i try to organize what i'm writing under headings across headings is when they are somehow linked, or templated
[00:22:13] <asus> Demosthenex, I think too. But what you said is really important to me ! I just figured out I put too much emphasize on the structure and my org documents nearly contain no text outside of folders or headings (!)
[00:23:09] <asus> I need to let it breath
[00:23:28] <asus> also the contacts.org is a great idea
[00:23:29] <Demosthenex> asus: so, under headings i frequently write plain lists, and paragraphs. that's it
[00:23:38] <Demosthenex> well... contacts is a deep and unsolved problem.
[00:23:40] <asus> you're right
[00:24:55] <asus> If the dentist address/phone are in a separate file, what do you do in the personal file ? Do you just write out the name of the dentist ? Or do you link to the contacts.org ?
[00:25:22] <Demosthenex> i could link, but typically i already have the phone # on my phone, i might only write down the address if i don't already know where to go
[00:25:32] <Demosthenex> i do try to put taht into into the same heading so i have info in one place
[00:25:37] <Demosthenex> duplication doesn't matter much
[00:25:45] <Demosthenex> at least it's up to date
[00:26:21] <asus> I use my phone too
[00:26:34] <Demosthenex> my phone has no links with emacs or org.
[00:26:42] <asus> neither does mine
[00:27:01] <Demosthenex> with one exception. my emacs appt function calls sendxmpp to send my chat account a reminder for upcoming appointments, and my phone gets those
[00:27:13] <asus> I think I'd periodically exports my phone contacts to .vcf, and put them in contacts.org
[00:27:16] <Demosthenex> along with my laptop, gaming pc, and anywhere else i'm logged in my chat
[00:27:40] <Demosthenex> i'd like to have a master contacts file in org, with periodic automated one way updates to overwrite my phone
[00:27:46] <Demosthenex> i haven't found a good way to do that.
[00:28:02] <Demosthenex> but maybe you want to look at org-contacts.el and vdirsyncer later
[00:28:07] <asus> sendxmpp looks really nice ! I did not know you could do this with emacs !
[00:28:19] <Demosthenex> well... sendxmpp is a command line program
[00:28:27] <Demosthenex> emacs can call any command line :P
[00:28:35] <Demosthenex> i just abuse that
[00:28:56] <asus> I see! :D
[00:29:15] *** Quits: dschrempf (~dominik@070-207.dynamic.dsl.fonira.net) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[00:29:18] <asus> As for contacts, I'd rather sync phone => emacs
[00:29:31] <asus> Because my phone contacts are well made
[00:29:33] <Demosthenex> i'd rather has my org file be the master copy
[00:29:46] <Demosthenex> because i'd organize them nicely, and the phone should just be overwritten
[00:29:48] <asus> why that ?
[00:30:05] <Demosthenex> but carddav and other techs really suck, and google's ruined the ecosystem
[00:30:15] <asus> phones already have any field one may want , am I wrong ?
[00:30:22] <Demosthenex> because it's hard to automatically 2 way sync data into text files.
[00:30:37] <Demosthenex> phones lack proper import and export mechs
[00:30:44] <asus> really ??
[00:30:47] <Demosthenex> yes. really.
[00:31:03] <Demosthenex> if you have an android phone, google wrote their own and won't share, and there's no standards for syncing
[00:31:10] <Demosthenex> just half-assed proprietary knockoffs
[00:31:11] <asus> I do it quite frequently, from a samsung to a huawei to a pixel, it even imported the contact pictures
[00:31:22] <Demosthenex> all via android's google api?
[00:31:42] <asus> ohhh yes, but the pixel uses lineage for microG, so no google API
[00:31:52] <Demosthenex> lineage's contacts are still android contacts = google.
[00:32:01] <asus> fuck I did not know
[00:32:02] <Demosthenex> the backend for contacts on android is all googled.
[00:32:10] <Demosthenex> even if it doesn't call home to them.
[00:32:19] <Demosthenex> they wrote their code, and the only reliable way to sync is thru their services
[00:32:22] <asus> are ou saying my .vcf file is android compatible only ???
[00:32:28] <Demosthenex> there's no OPEN standards that seem to work reliably
[00:32:45] <Demosthenex> no, you may find outlook and other proprietary solutions can read vcf, but not completely
[00:32:54] <asus> holy shit
[00:32:54] <Demosthenex> often there are mismatches in fields, groups, metadata, etc
[00:33:07] <asus> I'll try importing it in gnome contacts
[00:33:46] <Demosthenex> like i said, there was never a contact or calendar sync standard. by the time the industry started considering it, there were several proprietary implementations that kind of congealed, and no standard. and google gets to write their own
[00:33:56] <Demosthenex> and the webdav stuff is horrid
[00:34:05] <Demosthenex> caldav and carddav are flakey
[00:35:32] <Demosthenex> for instance, i have a nextcloud instance. i have davx5 on my android phone. there are multiple inconsistencies with fields and syncing in that simple example
[00:35:45] <Demosthenex> but if you use the gmail, google contacts, android contacts stack, you'd never see them
[00:38:23] <Demosthenex> ever read a .vcf or an .ical/.ics file? it's horrid. then try to read them from a mac, windoze, and android to compare.
[00:53:39] <asus> but you just told that you frequently import a .ics file into org ?? Demosthenex 
[00:55:23] <asus> Also, if I follow your thoughts, there's no OPEN standard for contact recording / syncing
[00:55:57] <asus> OTOH, org-mode enables one to create a coherent contacts database right ?
[00:56:19] <asus> and since it's just text, one could easily sync it (rsync, syncthing...)
[00:56:37] <asus> So how come no one thought of doing so yet ?
[00:58:13] <asus> https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8toivy/tip_how_to_manage_your_contacts_with_orgcontacts/
