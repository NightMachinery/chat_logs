[00:40:18] <furrykef> I actually know where the mouse/mice and louse/lice thing comes from. It's Germanic umlaut.
[00:40:20] <furrykef> In an earlier phase of the language, the plurals were something like "mūsi" and "lūsi". The "i"s caused the "ū"s to become rounded in Old English, resulting in "mȳs" and "lȳs".
[00:40:42] <furrykef> Sorry, I meant it caused the "ū"s to become fronted. They were already rounded.

[00:45:41] <furrykef> The Old English word "hūs" did not share this pattern, which is why today we say "houses". Words like "mūs" and "lūs" were odd exceptions even back then, so for all we know, the Anglo-Saxons made the same jokes.

[00:50:30] <LjL> furrykef, not sure if weird exceptions... in swedish, mus and lus are common (originally feminine, i just checked), while hus is neuter. like in english, the former have weird declensions, but hus stays unchanged in the plural like many neuters. then also, -i or similar for the plural is very IE
[00:50:58] *** Joins: totenkoph (~scythe@user/totenkoph)
[00:51:01] <LjL> so i guess they were exceptions at the time of Old English (and Old Norse) but i have the feeling they were the regular thing for feminine or non-neuter words in a prior phase

[11:36:39] <twb> gajus: *technically* the "'" character is a hack on computers
[11:37:08] <twb> gajus: it's Unicode old-name "APOSTROPHE-QUOTE" indicates this
[11:37:33] <twb> gajus: this is similar to how, on old typewriters, there was no "1" or "0" key.  Instead you just typed "l" or "O"
[11:38:18] <twb> gajus: logically, "you're" uses an apostrophe, and "'He is dead,' said Alice" uses quotes.
[11:39:13] <twb> gajus: whether this REALLY matters depends on what you're doing.  If you're writing in LaTeX or reST, just use the APOSTROPHE-QUOTE character and it will be fixed at compile time.  If you're using Word, then I think it is corrected at insertion time.
[11:40:23] <twb> I tend to aggressively use Unicode literals and even I don't write "you’re"
[11:41:12] <twb> "ocurred" is misspelt.  It should be "occurred".

[16:25:34] <huf> have you read the link I pasted?
[16:25:54] <fentanyl> Yeah, it means a magician hiding stuff in their sleeve.
[16:26:19] <fentanyl> Like, trick or something
[16:26:26] <huf> literally, yes, but in this case it's more metaphorical
[16:27:00] <huf> satan can do some miracles
[16:27:01] <huf> basically
