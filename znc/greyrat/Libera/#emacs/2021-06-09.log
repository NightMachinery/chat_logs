[02:52:39] <benaiah> has anyone else here run into an issue with yaml-mode version 0.0.15 (the current version) where M-x yaml-indent-line is inserting a TAB character? it's very confusing to me cause yaml isn't supposed to use tabs in the first place

[02:55:22] <benaiah> oh weird, it appears to be respecting indent-tabs-mode, which is on by default in yaml buffers for some reason
[02:56:35] <rdrg109> benaiah: I don't use yaml-mode but if I were debugging that issue, I would execute highlight-regexp and insert a TAB cahracter in the regex prompt so that tab characters are always colored.

[09:26:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And all of that could've been implemented back in xhtml without problem.
[09:26:53] <twb> HTML5 has better input validation than form4
[09:27:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I suppose, but at the same time any client-side validation is subject to users intentionally deviating anyway and bad devs assuming they won't.
[09:28:05] <twb> Aurora_v_kosmose: of course
[09:28:10] <twb> I validate server side as well
[09:28:18] <twb> but client-side means user gets a nice popup without me having to use js

[10:04:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I kinda have a different view of status than most, I guess.
[10:05:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ability and proficiency at getting shit done, for example making yourself a DIY car, is a lot more impressive than just blowing your boss a few times and buying some sport car.
[10:05:32] <twb> I really like those british kit cars
[10:05:44] <rnkn> twb: what you don't realise is they are selling you things to get annoyed about
[10:05:44] <twb> But that's more about YAGNI
[10:05:48] <rnkn> that's the business model
[10:06:20] <twb> rnkn: what is annoying me most is that in 2016 google switched android to be 100% proprietary
[10:06:46] <twb> rnkn: all existing open-source first-party apps got cloned into a proprietary area and all subsequent development is proprietary
[10:06:46] <rnkn> if they didn't, you would have less to be annoyed about and may have gone somewhere else
[10:07:01] <twb> rnkn: so for example the camera app is closed-source now
[10:07:16] <twb> There's *a* camera app in the AOSP tree, but it's unmaintained and not available in play store

[10:08:06] <twb> And that camera app in the play store is actually only supported on android 11 pixel, now I think about it
[10:08:10] <rnkn> I think I will do a startup that's just a subscription site for things to get annoyed about
[10:08:27] <twb> That's why Lenovo are shipping an open-source fork of Qualcomm's example camera app
[10:08:46] <rnkn> you pay $10/m and you get access to an app with an endless feed of infuriating things, tailored to your interests

[13:50:02] <FrostKiwi> Hey there :] I set (set-face-background 'default "unspecified-bg" nil), so my emacs -nw shows the transparent terminal and thus my wallpaper. Looks excellent. However, now with lsp-mode, lsp-ui and company-mode, all background colors of those elements default to a mess. comapny-mode is yellow, lsp-ui is light gray and unreadable. Can you somehow make the emacs -nw temrinal background transparent without using (set-face-background

[15:25:49] <Walex> grift: tthe model is cellphone apps: shift the maintenance burden from the *sysadmin* to the *developer*.
[15:25:50] <aidalgol> Let me put it this way: if I wanted to keep up with upstream GUI applications before flatpak came along, I lost *days* in dependency hell.  After flatpak, it takes a *single command* to get it.
[15:26:11] <aidalgol> Walex: That's... not a cellphone app model.

[15:26:52] <Walex> aidalgol: that's the cellphone app model: it is app to the developer of the cellphone app to keep it updated.
[15:27:16] <aidalgol> I know people like to shit all over the concept commonly known as "devops" because they like the good old days where the cadence of software development was slow enough that it was feasible to only ever use your distribution's packages, but this is widely considered the developer's problem now.
[15:27:46] <aidalgol> Walex: That's been the way it's been on home PCs since the 1980s.
[15:27:54] <Walex> aidalgol: you have to look at the question: who is X, where if X does not update the package it becomes abandonware.
[15:27:57] <grift> i know flatpak etc have the ability to keep things up to date (its not always working flawlessly but thats another issue) but there seems to be a log of deduplication (inefficient) it seems to be used as an excuse to ship bad code (text relocations, execstack bits set etc)
[15:28:29] <grift> but also looking aside from flatpak, i know i am hesistent to update some of my "bundles" for reasons
[15:28:36] <aidalgol> grift: right, I don't know what the heck you're talking about now.
[15:29:00] <Walex> aidalgol: sure, same as with home PCs, but server people "devops" have really gotten into it after cellphones, while to some extent Microsoft has slightly improved the MS-Windows situation.
[15:29:15] * aidalgol gives up on this discussion
[15:29:23] <grift> generally i guess i felt more confident with distributions packaging stuff than app vendors being responsible fori t
[15:29:49] <aidalgol> Yeah, that's always my first choice.
[15:29:49] <Walex> grift: "deduplication inefficiencies" are irrelevant with current storage sizes.

[15:39:08] <Walex> lampilelo: "obsolete libraries bundled with every prpogram" but that is precisely the economic reason for "installers", "snaps", "flatpaks", "containers", etc.: to shift the cost of updating dependencies from sysadmins to developers.

[15:46:46] <Walex> grift: for Debian/Ubuntu, when "upstream" abandons a program, sometimes the packager will become the new developer, sometimes the program will be removed from the distro.
[15:46:49] <grift> in my experience it works great because ven though the packager might not have more influence or is part of upstream, they are atleast usually closer to upstream than i
[15:46:56] <Walex> I have a very good example pertainining to EMACS!

[15:47:17] <Walex> the good example is 'psgml', which for me is essentiall and wonderful.
[15:47:20] <grift> i find a bug, report to distribution, distribution adds a patch, then takes it upstream form  e
[15:47:46] <grift> and the upstream patch trickles down and it replaces the distribution patch

[22:36:18] <grym> dale: i _think_ that for me, ,,exec-path-from-shell does the right $PATH juggling to put my pipx-managed pyls in a place where lsp-mode sees it fine 
[22:36:19] <fsbot> exec-path-from-shell is [0] a hack to set `exec-path' shellishly for Emacsen not launched from a shell, https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell
