[00:32:41] <pi_lounge> hi, i'm a bit of a novice with this stuff but i have had thelounge up and running on my pi since v4.0, updated to 4.2
[00:33:01] <pi_lounge> I can't seem to upgrade to the latest version though and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
[00:33:16] <pi_lounge> has anyone else had an issue with upgrading to v4.3?
[00:35:21] <pi_lounge> the container always closes with error 134, " Stopped for a minute with exit code 134 "
[00:35:37] <pi_lounge> and the only thing in the logs is this: "Node.js[10]: ../src/util.cc:188:double node::GetCurrentTimeInMicroseconds(): Assertion `(0) == (uv_gettimeofday(&tv))' failed.
[00:35:37] <pi_lounge> Aborted"
[00:36:06] <pi_lounge> i have tried creating a new container, and also upgrading the older one and both fail with the same messages
[00:39:04] <bookworm> that was reported before yes, alas not sure how to solve it
[00:39:43] <pi_lounge> oh damn :(
[00:39:53] <pi_lounge> is it just an issue with docker?
[00:40:06] <bookworm> it looks like a compilation mismatch but that's in theory what docker should avoid
[00:40:27] <bookworm> but considering the gazillion arm devices it wouldn't surprise me

[00:40:54] <bookworm> the deb works fine as a workaround for now if you want
[00:41:03] <pi_lounge> you mean install directly?
[00:41:14] <pi_lounge> yeah, i guess i can do that
[00:41:18] <bookworm> yes, like you know, a normal person ;P
[00:41:26] <pi_lounge> lol
[00:41:53] <pi_lounge> docker just keeps things nice and tidy for me, as i said, i'm a bit of a novice
[00:44:00] <bookworm> which pi?
[00:44:07] <bookworm> as in model / revision?

[00:50:52] <pi_lounge> sure, i can try that
[00:51:02] <pi_lounge> can't do it atm but should be able to in an hour, that okay?
[00:51:23] <bookworm> ah, just do it whenever you find time it's getting late here anyway
[00:51:38] <bookworm> just report back in here please, I'll see it
[00:51:43] <pi_lounge> kk, will do

[23:48:10] <Nuc1eoN> Hello guys I have a weird question
[23:48:20] <Nuc1eoN> I installed thelounge a longer time ago on my server
[23:48:39] <Nuc1eoN> However I truly do not remember how I installed it on my CentOS server
[23:49:01] *** Joins: exarchd99 (~exarch@98.46.60.169)
[23:49:06] <Nuc1eoN> I may have manually extracted it without a package manager, at least thats how it looks
[23:49:28] <Nuc1eoN> the binary is under /usr/local/bin/thelounge
[23:49:52] <Nuc1eoN> Now I would like to update... but for that I think it would be best if I deleted the current version from the file system
[23:49:59] <Nuc1eoN> and then install the npm version
[23:50:30] <Nuc1eoN> Now do you guys know how to fully uninstall thelounge
[23:51:08] <Nuc1eoN> I could ofc just delete the /usr/local/bin/thelounge file I guess?
[23:52:23] <xnaas> If you build it from source, I'm not actually quite sure where all it leaves files (someone else might be able to chime in with more input if you hang out for a while). There might be a /var/opt/thelounge or similar folder, at the very least.
[23:52:48] <knolle> i'm guessing you used npm install -g thelounge
[23:53:18] <Nuc1eoN> xnaas thanks so far
[23:53:32] <Nuc1eoN> knolle but should npm list list it then?
[23:54:30] <knolle> no clue, is there a npm list -g?
[23:55:00] <knolle> forgot how that thing works, i only remember where it leaves its binaries
[23:55:08] <Nuc1eoN> oh indeed!
[23:55:34] <Nuc1eoN> so to update it I just do `npm udate -g`?
