[04:24:00] <signofzeta> Twitch uses IRC on the back-end.  Now we just need a /r/sysadmin Twitch channel.
[04:24:01] <jimender2> I have connected to IRC through Netcat before and held full conversations

[04:24:14] <jimender2> is that true signofzeta?
[04:24:42] <signofzeta> yeah, their chat is powered by IRC.  I joined a Twitch chat via IRC.  You can see retracted and removed messages, and program bots, but it's not really useful without the audio and video.

[04:34:38] <signofzeta> the security people decry it for being written in PHP, but PHP is still a mature and developed language.  like any language, if you let your code shoot you in the foot, that's on you.
[04:34:56] <signofzeta> or the heck with it.  let's listen to the naysayers and re-code the bot in Rust.  That's popular today.
[04:35:05] <catbeard> code it in zig
[04:35:14] <catbeard> it's a rust compiler

[08:17:30] <corn266> yea that's the shitty thing about these, no SD card slot. i was also looking at one of the pocketbooks but they only thing it has above the poke3 is that it runs linux and has an SD card slot
[08:17:50] <xe0n> but you just use wifi to download?
[08:18:31] <Croran> xe0n mine has no wifi. it's like... cellular EVDO or something. the network doesn't even exist in my area anymore. lol. so yeah i load books with SD card.

[14:36:45] <Mark_Pinecone> Guys! Suggest some backup solution for Linux servers from cloud to on prem storage. Veeam agent didn't work out as well as expected.   
[14:38:10] <CptLuxx> veeam agent works fine for me
[14:38:11] <CptLuxx> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[14:38:34] <Mark_Pinecone> I encountered broken chain issue
[14:38:57] <Mark_Pinecone> while testing my backups
[14:40:56] <Mark_Pinecone> Also Veeam agent isn't designed for VBR repository behind NAT, I made it work but there were too many workaround for my taste. 
[15:04:23] <xe0n> Joe-Developer: GPO is the way...
[15:04:49] <Joe-Developer> or so he thought
[15:04:54] <xe0n> Mark_Pinecone: open a case with veam and explain your situation, they may be able to provide guidance
[15:05:01] <Joe-Developer> Gonna try out this Print Deploy feature from papercut
[15:05:09] <Joe-Developer> it seems really fuckin cool
[15:05:13] <xe0n> or sure use a third party thing like papercut
[15:05:19] <xe0n> but gpo mapping printers works fine
[15:05:51] <xe0n> why would you disable NLA...
[15:06:46] <Mark_Pinecone> xe0n I did that and they told me that my use case is not supported, they offered solution for broken chain issue though 
[15:06:54] <xe0n> cool cool

[18:42:20] <sd> 02<r​yalln> datto*
[18:42:21] <veam> I've been using it before I knew veeam was a thing
[18:42:27] <PublicWiFi> which is lame cause I was specing out an offline backup back then and had to swap to a "offline-ish" off-site NAS solution
[18:42:32] <sd> 02<r​yalln> work is thinking of it, and im like no based on name alone
[18:42:32] <csws> 11 has a feature where you can tell it to immediately copy to blobs on your SOBR
[18:42:34] <PublicWiFi> then 4 months later they released it
[18:42:39] <PublicWiFi> yeah dope
[18:42:53] <PublicWiFi> used to it would only send the last backup period's data
[18:43:02] <PublicWiFi> so the bucket would be like a week behind or whatever your period is
[18:43:16] <csws> ok PublicWiFi the b2 UI has changed and I cna't see the checkbox I was thinking of
[18:43:20] <csws> so hopefully it just works lol
[18:43:26] <csws> it was something about enumerating buckets
[18:43:27] <PublicWiFi> yeah ill test it with a free trial
[18:43:38] <PublicWiFi> guess i should upgrade veeeam..
[18:43:38] <csws> it supports object lock which is nice
[18:43:42] <csws> yes
[18:43:43] <csws> yes you should
[18:43:47] <PublicWiFi> license is good for upgrade right? doesn't work like esxi does it?
[18:43:54] <csws> I think you're fine as long as it's in support
[18:43:58] <PublicWiFi> yeee
[18:44:03] <PublicWiFi> we got hella supprt lol
[18:44:07] <PublicWiFi> like 3 years left or something

[18:45:04] <PublicWiFi> OH 
[18:45:05] <oxipital> "i need you to come over"
[18:45:07] <PublicWiFi> it went from 9.5 to 11...?
[18:45:09] <PublicWiFi> why
[18:45:20] <oxipital> same reason 8 to 10
[18:45:21] <PublicWiFi> microsoft is to blame
[18:45:23] <PublicWiFi> YES LOL
[18:45:36] <PublicWiFi> "we just added soo many features it was like 2 upgrades"
[18:45:36] <sintax> always blame M$
[18:45:43] <oxipital> normal folk dont understand how numbers work
[18:45:45] <sintax> ooh rounded corners :)
[18:45:54] <sintax> same issues but its pretty!
[18:45:56] <oxipital> the rounded corners is nice
[18:46:01] *** Joins: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi)
[18:46:02] <oxipital> are
[18:46:07] <signofzeta> Apple renamed Mac OS 8.7 to Mac OS 9 only so they could release Mac OS X.  Microsoft didn't even do that.
[18:46:14] <oxipital> i wish they still used aero style transparency
[18:46:23] <PublicWiFi> when i see version numbers i always get confused, like 1.11.1 is higher than 1.1.11 but my brain always reads it wrong
[18:46:26] <csws> PublicWiFi, 11 came out late last year I think?
[18:46:31] <oxipital> thats bc steve jobs is an autist
[18:46:32] <csws> I remember doing some eval
[18:46:46] <PublicWiFi> csws: yeah i thought I was only 1 version behind
[18:46:47] <oxipital> "no nine?!?! *spasm* *swallows toungue*
[18:46:50] <csws> rip
[18:46:52] <PublicWiFi> csws: the number skip messed me up for a sec lol
[18:46:57] <signofzeta> you're not wrong, oxipital
[18:47:03] <PublicWiFi> even their documentation talks like 9.5 is 10 -.- what
[18:47:12] <csws> I don't even remember what 10 did tbh
[18:47:16] <csws> actually 10 was pretty alright iirc
[18:47:21] <csws> then they had 10A
[18:47:22] <PublicWiFi> "you need to be at 9.5 version blahblah to upgrae to 11" "your 10 license is still valid"
[18:47:22] <signofzeta> Steve Jobs also filled his closet with turtlenecks and jeans so he wouldn't have to waste time picking something to wear.
[18:47:27] <csws> which was like some weird "oh we have slightly better AWS support"
[18:47:27] <PublicWiFi> bitch i have a 9.5 license
[18:47:36] <PublicWiFi> ^
[18:47:43] <PublicWiFi> yeah the CEO of veeam wasn't worried about cloud shit 
[18:47:53] <PublicWiFi> and their customer base gave them a lot of shit so they finally did it
[18:47:55] <signofzeta> Steve Jobs also took advantage of a CA law where you have six months to put a license plate on your new car.  He traded in his car every six months for an identical one.
[18:48:00] <csws> they have an azure thing that's a web UI
[18:48:02] <csws> it's not toooooooooo bad
[18:48:12] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> people wanking it to Steve Jobs always baffled me
[18:48:16] <csws> but I had endless issues with multiple subscriptions
[18:48:36] <csws> it just didn't seem to work at all. it would just fixate on the first subscription and everything else was invisible
[18:48:42] <csws> when I just gave it access to the one sub it worked great
[18:49:02] <csws> I told the veeam guy and he was insistent it should work but.. welp
[18:49:05] <csws> "let's wait for v2" or something
[18:49:09] <PublicWiFi> so..
[18:49:16] <fritzwastaken> lol I wish we had a veeam guy
[18:49:18] <PublicWiFi> i have a slightly unsupported setup and I hope this won't break it...
[18:49:23] <fritzwastaken> we run 200 copies of community edition

[19:08:36] <vinrock> you can get a model 3 with rebates for like 30k
[19:08:38] <mistiry> vinrock: You can, though. 
[19:08:52] <mistiry> It's not like you have to stop for 8 hours every time you need to recharge.
[19:08:56] <signofzeta> my last car cost $5K, and most of that was a fat insurance check.
[19:09:01] <mistiry> And you dont drain the battery to empty before you charge up.
[19:09:07] <signofzeta> but I just started a great job, so that should change.
[19:09:07] <vinrock> mistiry idk ive watched a lot of videos of people comparing trip times and charging always added too much time
[19:09:12] <mistiry> So its not like you charge it from 0%
[19:09:15] <vinrock> im impatient af i dont wait for anything that would drive me nuts
[19:09:30] <signofzeta> ideally, you would leave your car to charge while you went inside to pee and grab a meal.
[19:09:32] <mistiry> and that kind of attitude is part of the problem
[19:09:38] <vinrock> within the next 10 years tho i expect a big change
[19:09:40] <mistiry> "I WONT CHANGE! IM TOO IMPATIENT!"
[19:09:50] <mistiry> if everyone says that, we make no progress

[19:15:41] <PublicWiFi> you just gotta wire up a jig
[19:15:45] <signofzeta> A 240V outlet or a dedicated charger would be a much better option.  Ideally, if you own a house and buy an EV, spend some money on an electrician and get a dedicated charger.
