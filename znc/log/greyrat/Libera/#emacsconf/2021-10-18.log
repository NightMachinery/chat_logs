[06:30:21] <codingquark> 10min, IMO, is *the* hardest. It is just short enough and just long enough that you have to be a ninja

[18:25:44] <grym> i'm used to 5, 30, or 60 minute windows
[18:25:54] <grym> 10 would require some recalibration of thinking
[18:26:13] <grym> lightning talks are super fun 
[19:02:14] <pkal> codingquark: The time wasn't even the issue, it was just the number of times I had to restart the recording because I mispoke or messed something up
