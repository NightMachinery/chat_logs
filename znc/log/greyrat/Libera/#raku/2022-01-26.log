[03:02:50] <guifa> how does one make a call to a postcircumfix in RakuAST?
[03:19:39] <Xliff> That's a good question. Can't find an example in the tests?
[03:20:33] <Xliff> Are you talking custom operator?
[03:33:07] <Xliff> guifa: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/rakuast/t/12-rakuast/operators.t#L174 -- I don't know if custom ops are supported, yet.
[03:34:51] <guifa> Ah okay, so you just apply it as if it were a postfic

[06:03:14] <guifa> Is there a good way to have a module released with a RASTy and non-RASTy version coexisting?  I guess I could check for %ENV<RAKUDO_RAKUAST>, but the RakuAST::* will bomb on compile before the check would go into play
