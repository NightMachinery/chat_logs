[04:40:21] <karstensrage> jfc aws is confusing 
[04:40:26] <TonyStone> is there standard functions in languages for working with exponents?

[04:42:47] <TonyStone> i am simulating a random test... and i basically have a user input where they can add a weight of 1 to 10 to increase probablilioty of a random number happening...
[04:43:45] *** Quits: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[04:45:35] <TonyStone> so i thought it would be a good idea to start with a constant random vaue of 1000  and then the random test value will be set by user input(aka weight 1-10)... so my thought was to just multiply the constant of $randomtestval=1000^$weight then call random($randomtestvalue);    <----- lol./... something like that.... i am struggling and this should be VERY SIMPLE

[09:33:09] <beaky> hello what are some patterns and antipatterns in functional programming
[09:33:24] <beaky> like how using explicit recursion is an antipattern you must use recursion schemes (pattern)
[09:33:40] <beaky> or the free monad pattern which ive read about for years in haskell but dont know whta its really about
[09:33:42] <beaky> or lenses
[09:33:49] <beaky> or antipatterns like using list
[09:34:08] <beaky> partial functions another antipattern when you can easily make everything total
[09:34:20] <beaky> (you achieve totality using Maybe)
[09:35:10] *** Quits: Thedarkb-Desktop (~beno@2001:bb6:b403:e042:eddb:bad1:54bd:85ba) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[09:35:56] <beaky> why monads are a pattern https://philipnilsson.github.io/Badness10k/escaping-hell-with-monads/
[09:35:58] <bayaz> Title: Badness 10.0000 | Escaping Hell with Monads 
[09:36:01] <jinsun> using list is antipattern?
[09:36:25] <Burkuf> trying to use patterns is an antipattern
[09:37:43] <beaky> yes using lists is an antipattern because 99.99999% of the time there are better data structures for the problem and lists are usually the inefficient choice (usually Data.Vector is preferable its like an efficient array), the only use for list is for control flow (in whcih case it's really like a stream)

[09:38:23] <beaky> and when you use lists to iterate over data (another common use for lists) you really want ot use the Foldable interface over the more efficient data structure https://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/~waldmann/etc/untutorial/list-or-not-list/
[09:38:26] <bayaz> Title: index 
[09:39:06] <beaky> indeed trying to use patterns is an antipattern the idea of patterns is not to blindly apply them but to identify and critically examine them 
[09:39:09] *** Joins: hexingb (~hexingb@101.236.65.176)
[09:40:45] <jinsun> oh linked lists that functional languages like to use
[09:40:57] <beaky> yes that kind of list (its like singly-linked lists in c)
[09:41:49] <jinsun> what is totality?
[09:42:22] <beaky> totality is when you have total functions and a function is total when every input has an output (if some inputs have undefined output then it is a partial function)
[09:43:20] <beaky> like for example the infamous 'head' function on lists is undefined if the list is empty so it is a partial function
[09:43:47] <jinsun> okay so returning None instead of throwing exception

[11:55:02] <Akronymus> Do you mean types belonging to a namespace?
[11:55:13] <beaky> yes types should be scoped it helps a lot in type based programming when you are working with multiple different types as 'modules' for example given different instances of the same type family you can have different carrier sets
[11:55:15] <flaknet> yeah a namespace 
[11:55:48] <Akronymus> Yeah, they should be scoped to belong in namespaces/modules
[11:55:51] <beaky> tho it is also important to 'unpack' things too which is why agda has 'open module' which lets you open up the names to the outer scope
[11:55:57] <beaky> helps keep things less nested
[11:55:57] <Akronymus> even if just to give meta information

[14:56:22] <password> just ignore it?
[14:56:34] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: what was the problem?
[14:57:03] <user51> that, given two non-empty arrays A and B of Z integers,
[14:57:16] <pyzozord> in the loop where I was doing the factorization for (let j=2; j<=b; j++), b is always the smaller number, that's incorrect, there might be more primes in a than in b
[14:57:25] <GeDaMo> Ah
[14:57:33] <user51> so it's like z == (length(a) == length(b))
[14:57:41] <pyzozord> (let j=2; j<=a; j++) gives me 100% correctness https://app.codility.com/demo/results/training4AW39B-V3J/

[18:11:26] <[itchyjunk]> yeah i think diff eq is more popular in phy circles
[18:11:28] <[itchyjunk]> not math circles.
[18:11:29] <pikapika> The motivation for pure math stuff is much more abstract and hard
[18:11:42] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], obviously I meant general pop not math students
[18:11:51] <[itchyjunk]> Out of the ~15 students who graduated with math i know, 1 took diff eq's
[18:11:53] <pyzozord> bjs: it's not about knowing specific theroms, I'm talking more about general experience with math puzzles
[18:12:03] <[itchyjunk]> pikapika, general population have never heard of diff eq
[18:12:05] <pyzozord> people with phds tend to have more of that experience
[18:12:07] <bjs> pyzozord: I mean my last statement didn't even mention math at all
[18:12:20] <bjs> pyzozord: this is a fun little coding toy problem, it's nowhere near phd level anythings
[18:12:28] <[itchyjunk]> you can go through early physics without using the word "diff eq"
[18:12:38] <[itchyjunk]> netwonian eq's are introduced without mentioning differentials
[18:12:41] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], the total number of people in electrical engg is probably more than the total people in a pure math
[18:12:46] <pyzozord> bjs: sure. I feel like you are trying to get me to feel worse though
[18:12:53] <[itchyjunk]> that's physics
[18:12:56] <pikapika> pyzozord, yeah its a bunch of bs
[18:13:00] <[itchyjunk]> we covered "physics" alrleady
[18:13:02] <pikapika> Even if you are just given a blackbox gcd function
[18:13:08] <bjs> pyzozord: let me ask you this, that site gives you N=15, M=75 and it tells you about gcd.  What is gcd(15, 75) ?
[18:13:11] <pikapika> you still need to know factors and number theory shit
[18:13:32] <pikapika> Its not the concept thats the problem its that the sizeso f numbers entail a deeper thinking algorithm
[18:13:54] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], and physics people are part of genpop
[18:13:59] <[itchyjunk]> no
[18:14:02] <pikapika> I already clarified I meant genpop
[18:14:04] <[itchyjunk]> you said not specific but general
[18:14:07] <pikapika> Not "math majors"
[18:14:12] <[itchyjunk]> gen population means gen population
[18:14:15] <pyzozord> bjs: 15
[18:14:17] <[itchyjunk]> not "physics people"
[18:14:19] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], and physics/electrical engg have a larger population
[18:14:26] <pikapika> so their percentage is larger
[18:14:32] <[itchyjunk]> same reason "math people" is not general pop, "phy people" is not gen pop
[18:14:34] <bjs> pyzozord: and what does that tell you?
[18:14:45] <[itchyjunk]> general population doesn't mean a cherry picked population
[18:14:54] <pikapika> It does not
[18:14:55] <[itchyjunk]> if i survay a university with 10's of thousands of people
[18:15:01] <[itchyjunk]> most people won't know what diff eq is.
[18:15:02] <pyzozord> bjs: that the greatest common divisor is not greater than the smaller of the two numbers
[18:15:03] <pikapika> but if say 0.1% are math majors and 5% are phy/electrical
[18:15:09] <[itchyjunk]> that's not relevent.
[18:15:12] <pikapika> and the rest don't know anything about diff eqs
[18:15:12] <[itchyjunk]> you said gen population.
[18:15:15] <pikapika> it still means
[18:15:22] <pikapika> more people found diff eq exciting
[18:15:22] <PlanckWalk> Most people's idea of "a math field" is something like "percentages" or "equations"

[18:20:11] <pyzozord> bjs: what?
[18:20:17] <kobalt> so I pinged someone by mistake
[18:20:30] <bjs> pyzozord: gcd is a function that takes two numbers as input and gives you a factor.
[18:20:35] <[itchyjunk]> PlanckWalk, that shows math is bigger than engineering?
[18:20:36] <pyzozord> bjs: that's like description of almost any function
[18:20:37] <[itchyjunk]> rofl!

[18:20:50] <[itchyjunk]> pikapika, statistics is a very popular field
[18:20:54] <[itchyjunk]> statistics falls under math
[18:20:55] <PlanckWalk> [itchyjunk]: Yeah, WTF?
[18:20:58] <bjs> pyzozord: yes you're starting to get it
[18:21:09] <PlanckWalk> It's even out of order
[18:21:09] <[itchyjunk]> my uni definately has more statisticians being produced than EE
[18:21:13] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], so do diff eqs, but which are typically these days studied under a physics or a ee degree

[18:22:20] <pikapika> Math is taught in many other degrees
[18:22:21] <[itchyjunk]> that's not a point at all
[18:22:37] <[itchyjunk]> you were talking about popularity of a branch of math
[18:22:42] <bjs> pyzozord: if you just put the two numbers into the function you get another factor, and you divide you get another number. Oh look I have two numbers, let me put the two numbers into my function that accepts 2 numbers..
[18:22:43] <[itchyjunk]> i highly doubt your claim holds.
[18:22:44] <kobalt> I think maths is a tool rather than a subject.
[18:22:46] <pikapika> Math is taught in a physics degree or in a ee degree
[18:22:52] <[itchyjunk]> math is definately a subject
[18:22:57] <pikapika> So pure math degrees are much less
[18:23:02] <kobalt> okay but it is also a tool
[18:23:09] <[itchyjunk]> that doesn't mean popularity of subfield of math is determined 
[18:23:15] <pikapika> Because most people who have a need for some mathematical topic, would just learn it as part of their main subject
[18:23:19] <[itchyjunk]> not everyone who takes ee enjoys DE.
[18:23:25] <[itchyjunk]> This is making less sense by the second.
[18:23:36] <[itchyjunk]> You claim is because more people take EE then math, DE is more popular

[18:59:04] <kobalt> you see many competitive programming just asks discrete maths problems from counting, probability, number theory, set theory, etc
[19:00:11] <pyzozord> that "looking for patterns" is what is close to what I call "mathematical thinging", it's a part of it
[19:00:29] <bjs> pyzozord: you're not going to be able to solve these problems without trying some examples and looking at numbers
[19:00:29] <pyzozord> and I believe math studends are much better at it than people who don't have anything to do with math
[19:00:57] <bjs> pyzozord: well sure, people who study math will be more used to searching for patterns and they'll have seen this particular pattern before
[19:01:00] <pyzozord> and simple operation of division doesn't really have anything to do with the real challange of recognising the right patterns
[19:01:23] <kobalt> I have this understanding that math is just a tool for other subjects.
[19:01:35] <bjs> pyzozord: but if until now you haven't just tried to do the GCD on lots of different numbers to see what you get and what patterns you can see,  I can't see how you're ever going to be able to solve the problem
[19:02:30] <pyzozord> but there is some aspect of division in there, for me the idea that dividing two numbers gdc of those two numbers kind of removes the common part from those two numbers is abstract and would have not crossed my mind. That comes with just experience and time spent thinking about numbers
[19:02:32] *** Joins: inky (~inky_@46.36.114.205)
[19:03:04] <bjs> pyzozord: it's common in that you can divide *either* number by it,  it's a common divisor. It's a divisor that both numbers have
[19:03:21] <bjs> again this should jump out at you if you write down some lists of numbers and look at their GCDs
[19:03:27] <pyzozord> there is some level of intuitivenes with numbers required to reason logically though that, or some level of intuitiveness with pattern recognition required if you want to stumble on the answer randomly, in either case some experience is required

[19:04:15] <mrig> lets rewrite inkscape in go! :D
[19:04:23] <bjs> pyzozord: yes some level of experience is required of course, and a lot of fumbling around with the numbers until you understand better what the GCD is giving you,  but really "pyzozord doesn't immediatley understand, therefore it's phd-level" is a bit of a leap :P

[19:06:17] <kobalt> how about an open source game.
[19:06:20] <piou> pyzozord: math students are better at it, because they've seen more patterns so it's easier for them to recognize them. It's also easier for them to exploit these patterns since they've seen many proofs and proofs tend to have common structures (like "design patterns" for maths). But it's important to stress that even pro mathematicians spend a lot of time looking for patterns, looking for ideas,
[19:06:24] <mrig> even for film and video it would be fine if you are not doing realtime.
[19:06:26] <piou> drawing shitty diagrams on a blackboard or on paper, trying number manipulations on excel or such... That's just how it's done.

[19:06:41] <mrig> Which would be problematic?
[19:06:59] <bjs> pyzozord: it's not really about being good at math to see what you can do with a GCD,  you don't get that by studying GCD in school. You get that by ... writing down lists of numbers and seeing what happens when you GCD them and by relating that to what you know about multiplication and division

[20:00:51] <GeDaMo> Yes
[20:00:53] <Common-Lisp> Yeah

[20:03:01] <Izem> I still want to learn bus design so I can figure out why the smaller ports have to be so complex

[20:06:08] <[itchyjunk]> installing qemu is too hard
[20:06:18] <Izem> what os?
[20:06:53] <pikapika> Izem, its not related to the size
[20:07:04] <Izem> you can try virtmanager or virtualbox instead
[20:08:03] <[itchyjunk]> ubuntu 18.04
[20:09:17] <deniska> Izem: a lot of complexity in modern ports stems from the fact that once you start switching signals really fast (to transfer data quickly), wire begins acting like an antenna
[20:09:38] <deniska> Izem: so now you have to use differential pairs instead of a single wire
[20:09:51] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmm
[20:10:04] <[itchyjunk]> differential pairs had come up in some other discussion and i remember looking at it
[20:10:07] <[itchyjunk]> now i can't remember shit
[20:10:09] <deniska> and then you may also want to put more than a single device on the same port, so now you may want some packet switching in your protocol

[20:11:07] *** Joins: One39Dev (LordShiva@user/one39dev)
[20:11:20] <deniska> and then there's the whole issue with a clock, a lot of fast protocols don't put clock on the bus, so it has to be recovered from the signal
[20:11:25] <pikapika> and the general usb specification I think specifies a complete networking thing of sorts
[20:11:28] <[itchyjunk]> qemu is used to emulate .iso or some such right?
[20:11:34] <[itchyjunk]> how do you emulate a hardware with it?
[20:11:37] <[itchyjunk]> only hardware
[20:11:43] <deniska> so now your protocol shouldn't transfer too many "highs" or "lows" in a row, otherwise the clock becomes unrecoverable
[20:11:46] <[itchyjunk]> i haven't figured out what i need to install still
[20:11:54] <Izem> those must be really fast, I would think the clock had a descent speed
[20:12:11] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: qemu has a lot of invocation options including "put these data on some memory offset and jump to it"
[20:12:24] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmm

[22:50:56] <Izem> you can use emacs

[22:51:35] <mrig> dunkeln: both vim and emacs can do this, you would also likely find a light editor on the machine that you are connecting to, that ideally you already know how to use.

[22:54:37] <dunkeln> can you edit when you are connected via sftp...i didnt try yet CyberTailor. I'll try now
[22:55:04] <CyberTailor> no, it's a ftp-like scp replacement

[22:56:53] <dunkeln> mrig: yes, im currently  doing that but i miss the features on my PC's editor.
[22:57:38] <jeaye> dunkeln: I typically go with sshfs first.
[22:58:01] <jeaye> Like mount, but allowing you to mount a remote dir to a local dir, backed by SSH.
[22:58:10] <dunkeln> jeaye: do you use OSX,any chance.
[22:58:12] <jeaye> So you can use your local editor, plugins, etc.
[22:58:21] <jeaye> dunkeln: Both macOS and Linux.
[22:58:27] <jeaye> sshfs works on both.

[23:02:43] <jeaye> The syntax is particular. Don't forget the : after the host. i.e.: `sshfs jeaye@foo.com: remote-dir` will mount jeaye's home dir on your local remote-dir. `jeaye@foo.com:foo` would be relative to jeaye's home, so ~/foo for jeaye.
