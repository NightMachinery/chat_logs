[00:04:22] <hinst> I was talking on another coding channel yesterday and made fun of a member's name. Turned out, the member had admin role. (it was not obvious). So he wrote me "you know, I can ban you". And I was like "fuck u" and quit

[00:42:23] <hinst> I cannot tell who has admin role
[00:42:32] <hinst> I use Hexchat. All names are displayed the same
[00:42:36] <hinst> same font, same color
[00:42:43] <T`aZ> this should not matter at all
[00:43:35] <T`aZ> so feel free to make fun of everybody :p

[11:08:13] <jotham> evening ERROH 
[11:08:32] <ERROH> how do
[11:10:26] <jotham> my mate got starlink
[11:10:39] <jotham> he's had one outage in 6 weeks
[11:10:46] <jotham> he lives in the middle of nowhere here in nz
[11:10:55] <jotham> 200mbit down 20 up
[11:11:04] <jotham> 300ms ping to london
[11:12:02] <jotham> 262 for me on terrestrial fiber
[11:12:11] <jotham> least to 5.152.197.179 which appears to be in london
[11:12:39] <jotham> so that's not very much difference for going to space and back

[11:55:40] <Carbonflux> they see everything as work
[11:56:03] <Carbonflux> so they make everything into work
[11:56:43] <Renderwww> Carbonflux sounds like he hasn't realized humans need work to have a fulling life
[11:57:00] <Renderwww> if you aint working 80 hours a week you aren't living!
[11:58:27] <T`aZ> american spotted
[11:59:33] <Renderwww> the whole protestant work ethics thing was a mistake
[11:59:46] <jotham> haha was just thinking that
[12:00:53] <Carbonflux> even atoms are lazy, they tend to fall back to the lowest energy state unless "excited" by social media.
[12:01:02] <Renderwww> I'm doing like 32 hours/week. Which is manageable but I wouldn't mind doing less
[12:03:00] <jotham> like 10-20 for me
[12:06:00] <Renderwww> no wonder it took you years to get out of tax prison if you only work one day per week
[12:08:14] <Renderwww> oh shit, three new arcane episodes are out
[12:08:19] <Renderwww> day ruined
[12:09:27] <Carbonflux> looks like the last three
[12:11:23] <Renderwww> great, now I'm tempted to just watch them in one go
[12:12:05] <Carbonflux> thats what i am going to do, counting the three new ones i have five left.
[12:27:29] <ERROH> starlink is a lot lower than say iridium, right?
[12:27:39] <ERROH> maybe that's why latency is better
[12:28:27] <ERROH> i would usually know this things but life lost its spark
[13:20:23] <Renderwww> take your vitamine d and everything will be happy happy joy joy again
[13:23:00] <jotham> vitamin dong
[13:59:59] <Renderwww> there, done with arcane
[14:01:27] <Renderwww> I hope they throw another huge pile of money in the general direction of the studio to make more like that
[14:25:27] <Carbonflux> i agree, great animation style

[23:20:15] <hinst> Sad that I have to work on Sunday
[23:21:16] <hinst> We had an ultra-long meeting at work on Wednesday and Thursday. It lasted about half a day. Team members were supposed to spend the second half of those days working. But it was too overwhelming for me to keep working after hours of meetings
[23:21:35] <hinst> So I had no time to complete my tasks
[23:22:01] <hinst> Of course I have the option to say "screw this" and chill
