[14:11:10] <style> DarthGandalf... how I can update my znc if I got it from repository when I installed it (sudo apt-get install znc)?
[14:11:29] <style> if I locate znc on the user I see files on 3 diff locations
[14:12:14] <bookworm> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade then
[14:12:28] <bookworm> keep in mind that some distros ship rather old versions
[14:12:52] <bookworm> the usual workaround is either a from source install or adding a third party repo
[14:12:53] <style> that isnt updating the znc to a new version
[14:13:16] <bookworm> (or getting a better distro ;P )
[14:13:22] <DarthGandalf> bookworm++
[14:13:51] <DarthGandalf> style: yes, debian is known to not have the newest software
[14:14:08] <DarthGandalf> if you use debian stable aka debian ancient
[14:14:41] <bookworm> you could enable backports which should have a newer version, probably not the latest though
[14:14:45] <bookworm> don't know
[14:15:22] <style> thats why millions of people use windows :D
[14:15:45] <style> programs popup update windows and regular users just click the button :D
[14:15:55] <style> yea... im on ubuntu 
[14:16:22] <style> and thought will be much easier to just download the last version, install it and keep the config
[14:16:30] <style> install it over what I already have installed.
[14:16:34] <bookworm> define easier
[14:17:01] <bookworm> you then need to package it up or yolo install to /usr/local on your own and keep it updated
[14:17:18] <bookworm> it's certainly possible and not hard to do
[14:17:27] <style> yep, that is what I want to do
[14:17:34] <style> but need to understand it first
[14:17:45] <style> because the 1st installation was done from the distro
[14:18:08] <style> and try to understand what location to give to the new version when installing it
[14:18:18] <style> to not double install
[14:18:32] <bookworm> depends, via dpkg / apt or via sudo make install?

[14:19:35] <bookworm> ubuntu has a thing called checkinstall that can generate a package which you can then install with the package manager
[14:19:54] <bookworm> that's somewhat cleaner as it's easy to track the files

[14:21:55] <style> I think my confusion is something related to cmake location 
[14:22:08] <style> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
[14:22:13] <bookworm> /usr/* isn't important, those will be deleted once you uninstall the package
[14:22:26] <bookworm> do you want a custom user install or a system install?
[14:22:52] <bookworm> system wide stuff you install manually should go to /usr/local (set that as a prefix)
[14:22:56] <style> I have the znc on a user that I created just for the znc
[14:23:10] <bookworm> doesn't answer the question
[14:23:17] <style> the installation isnt done from root. i do it from the user
[14:24:10] <bookworm> then you can't set the prefix to /usr/local, then you install to a homedir and you need to make sure that the stuff is actually in the $PATH and so on when you execute it
[14:25:29] <bookworm> the prefix pretty much tells cmake where you want the resulting hierarchy to go (lib, bin, share etc)
[14:27:37] <bookworm> you wanna make sure to use the proper prefix though, not just the install prefix
[14:28:06] <bookworm> the two may not be the same of you try to package an application, hence there are two config values
[14:28:57] <style> eh... will see. if will work is perfect, if not... will erase everything and do a clean install from source

[21:59:33] <antto> do many people use znc+hexchat?
[21:59:44] *** kour1er is now known as kour1er_
[21:59:59] <illu> relative to facebook, no, relative to total znc users, yes
[22:00:09] <antto> this combo somehow produces weird sh*t like excess floods and i don't know why, i'm always afk when it happens
[22:03:03] <antto> i'm suspecting it's hexchat's fault, because i used mIRC+znc for a long time with no glitches, and the glitches started happening when i started using hexchat too, but then i thought the combo hexchat+mIRC is freaking out znc maybe
[22:03:16] <antto> now i'm only using hexchat+znc, and weird sh*t still happens
[22:04:35] <Error> antto : did you set it up porperly? just saying!

[22:05:16] <antto> i have turned off a bunch of hidden default options in hexchat which were terrible
[22:05:21] <Error> check this out it may help! again Just saying ;P
[22:05:26] <antto> like, it periodically does /who # on all channels

[22:52:50] <Ramses> in znc
[22:55:04] <antto> i don't connect with multiple clients now, only one hexchat
[22:55:20] <Ramses> ah ok
[22:55:49] <antto> and i've configured hexchat to not do this /who # sh*t otherwise i can't go to #<network_channel>
[22:55:57] <antto> i get excess flood or so
[22:56:10] <Ramses> damn sounds irretating :)
[22:56:45] <antto> even my silly script for mIRC was only doing /who on small channels and only on-join, once
[22:56:51] <antto> not periodically
[22:56:58] <antto> dafuq is hexchat thinking?
[22:57:42] <Ramses> dunno, tried AdiIrc ?
[22:58:54] <antto> but that's for crapdows
[22:59:03] <antto> i do have mIRC there, that's the best sh*t
