[02:31:46] <Delf> What is yours?
[02:32:45] <Thilastiko> those digambara ("cloud clothed") jainists have got the right idea methinks
[02:33:38] <Thilastiko> I like to think up what would chimeric "superreligion" look like, made from just the best parts of all existing religions
[02:34:12] <Delf> Can you give one single example of a best part of any religion?
[02:34:15] <Thilastiko> pretty sure it would leave out gods and the genital mutilation
[02:34:31] <causative> religion minus the nonsense wrong beliefs is not a religion
[02:34:53] <Delf> Yes it is
[02:35:02] <Thilastiko> its just a tradition, like watching football in underwear

[02:36:18] <critr> A good part of many religions is the morality that helps people to live together peacefully.
[02:36:34] <Thilastiko> what religion has morality?
[02:36:35] <causative> morality is not a religion
[02:36:46] <Thilastiko> pretty sure there is no morality in the bible
[02:36:54] <causative> religion is when you believe in magic sky men and life after death
[02:37:13] <critr> I see that I'm not speaking with rational people, so I withdraw from the discussion. :)
[02:37:18] <vaquero> Thilastiko:  this has to be the cringiest thing ive ever seen
[02:37:23] <Thilastiko> judiasm has the sky men, but no life after death
[02:37:24] <Delf> Religion is when you strongly believe and refuse to question your belief
[02:38:02] <Delf> If you have a strong belief in what death is, end or no end, continuation or something else entirely, you're religious about it.
[02:38:16] <Thilastiko> ya mon, its like sticking to your favorite explanation in spite of the best explanation
[02:38:31] <Thilastiko> the superreligion wont have any of that
[02:38:55] <Delf> critr: Get back here. Why throw such accusations? Just to bail on us?
[02:38:59] <Thilastiko> no faith necessary in the superreligion, just the football and naked yoga
[02:39:38] <vaquero> you dont have faith?
[02:39:57] <Thilastiko> nope, sorry gorge Micheal
[02:40:01] <vaquero> i find it so funny when people act like faith is a uniquely religious thing.
[02:40:17] <Thilastiko> its a superstitions thing
[02:40:32] <Thilastiko> if it was justified it would be called "trust"
[02:40:34] <vaquero> anytime you do something without certainty of an outcome but have a desired outcome your operating on faith
[02:40:37] <Thilastiko> you gotta earn trust
[02:40:46] <causative> faith is "believing something without rational evidence"

[02:40:59] <Thilastiko> vaquero: nope thats just probability
[02:41:06] <causative> if you do something without certainty of an outcome, but have rational reason to think the outcome will probably happen, that's not faith
[02:41:07] <Thilastiko> "risk management" is not faith
[02:42:32] <vaquero> Thilastiko:  probably isnt faith nor is risk management. we are talking about a belief, if you believe things are going to turn out a certain way without any certainty of that being the case its faith
[02:42:40] <vaquero> i get in the car with faith others will drive properly.
[02:42:52] <vaquero> no certainty that i wont be hit or that i wont have an accident
[02:43:28] <vaquero> you go to the bus stop, faith the bus will arrive. all these little things are based in faith
[02:43:40] <Thilastiko> belief is just a mundane mental faculty
[02:43:49] <Thilastiko> you need belief just to ride a bike
[02:44:10] <Thilastiko> its only unjustified belief that makes religions unique
[02:44:24] <Thilastiko> we wont be having that in the superreligion
[02:44:56] <vaquero> a mundane mental faculty that has the ability to radically shape or impact your life and world view.   yeah lets keep ignoring these things. luckily we have big pharma to pump us with drugs and consumerism to fill that whole that doesnt seem to be ending
[02:44:57] <Thilastiko> in fact, everyone will need to prove their trustworthyness in the superreligion with obligatory "trustfalls"
[02:45:31] <causative> look, not all uncertain belief is "faith"
[02:45:31] <Thilastiko> are there pills that can make you "believe" things?

[02:47:56] <Thilastiko> What about "proselytizing" for the superreligion?
[02:48:36] <Thilastiko> should we go out and get converts, or keep it kinda cool and intimate... maybe with curtains and candles?
[02:49:03] <vaquero> depends if you think the new religion will help those people or if your just pushing it for the sake of pushing it
[02:49:51] <Thilastiko> yeah, your right! The superreligion is not a drug, to be pushed on the street
[02:50:05] <vaquero> thats not what i said but ok lol
[02:50:48] <Thilastiko> In fact, how about we only let people who dont care about religion join the superreligion?
[02:51:08] <Thilastiko> that would be hip and ironic, which is what the kids are into
[02:51:53] <vaquero> cause that would be as gay as atheism. if you define yourself by your opposition then what are you
[02:52:34] <Thilastiko> ehy - gay worked for christianity
[02:53:12] <Thilastiko> jesus was hella gay, and the early christians just defined themselves as "not greeks"
[02:53:16] <vaquero> if you want to be a loser who needs to wait for others to tell you what they are so you can define yourself then your pretty gay
[02:53:59] *** Parts: critr (~critr@user/critr) (.)
[02:54:03] <Thilastiko> tan you for calling me a pretty gay, but unfortunately you are barking up the wrong tree
[02:55:12] <Thilastiko> So, so far we've figured out the superreligion will have:
[02:55:17] <Thilastiko> 1) naked yoga
[02:55:18] *** Quits: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[02:55:32] <Thilastiko> 2) sundoay morning football, clothing optional
[02:55:52] <Thilastiko> 3) nice decorative candles and curtains
[02:56:05] <Thilastiko> 4) only atheists and agnostics
[02:56:41] <Thilastiko> sounds pretty good, right?
[02:56:45] <vaquero> not at all
[02:56:49] <vaquero> sounds pretty cringe
[02:57:07] <Thilastiko> well how about:
[02:57:18] <Thilastiko> 5) a PS5
[02:57:39] <Thilastiko> that ones a crown pleaser
[02:57:46] <Thilastiko> *crowd
[02:59:19] <vaquero> first its jsut going to be fat neckbeards that no one wants to see do naked yoga and probably dont watch sport.  second it will just be cringe atheist's who are purely there so they have an outlet to cry about other religions making the environment nothing but sad sacks.
[02:59:35] <Thilastiko> a typical sunday service will revolve around watching football, doing naked yoga, and playing PS5 on a sacred 82-inch bigscreen

[03:03:46] <biys> so what i do is CBT or practice emotional intelligence
[03:03:55] <biys> but for some reason my body isn't relaxing
[03:04:03] <biys> in my mind i know nothing is technically wrong, at this point
[03:04:13] <biys> but my body is in a fight or flight mode
[03:04:26] <causative> just observe yourself not relaxing
[03:04:31] <causative> your body is doing that, it's okay, just watch it do it
[03:04:48] <Thilastiko> sometimes you need immediate specific problems to distract you form the long-term existential ones
[03:04:49] <causative> you will find it passes if you watch it
[03:04:50] <vaquero> take a seat, take a breather and remind yourself in time it will pass
[03:05:08] <biys> yah, it's still weird though
[03:05:27] <Thilastiko> play some PS5 in a candlelit room
[03:05:44] <biys> Thilastiko: i don't play video games.
[03:06:08] <Thilastiko> do you like football?
[03:06:17] <biys> i don't sport either
[03:06:20] <biys> i'ev fit
[03:06:27] <biys> :s/i'ev/i'm/
[03:06:31] <biys> but i don't sport
[03:06:42] <audrey> Thilastiko: I´m okay.
[03:07:01] <audrey> Just the usual aches and pains.
[03:07:06] <biys> i tend to think that sports are a way to placate the masses
[03:07:13] <Thilastiko> audrey: migraines and relationship problems as usual?
[03:07:23] <audrey> Thilastiko: in a manner of speaking
[03:07:38] <audrey> I probably should go to the store at some point before it becomes crowded in advance of Thanksgiving.
[03:07:57] <vaquero> biys: its alright dude, just remind yourself there is nothing wrong with having anxiety and ride it out, the amount of people who exacerbate there anxiety because they have anxiety is bananas
[03:08:02] <biys> oh yah, you yanks and your celebration of settlers day in november.  i always forget about that
[03:08:05] <Thilastiko> oh yea, its a madhouse out there, Friday will be even worse
[03:08:42] <biys> vaquero: what's weird, to me anyways, is my anxiety has actually gotten worse as i've gotten older
[03:08:55] <audrey> Consumerist madness.
[03:08:56] <biys> regardless the undertanding i have... it's increased
[03:09:09] <biys> regardless how much i know it's just some fault inside my brain
[03:09:17] <biys> it's increased
[03:09:36] <audrey> Surprised Thanksgiving hasn´t had its turkey neck cancelled yet, honestly.
[03:09:43] <audrey> they´re trying to get rid of Columbus Day (and good riddance)
[03:10:12] <biys> audrey: around these parts thanks giving is criticized by the aboriginal americans
[03:10:58] <audrey> I don´t mind the free days off work, but I dislike Thanksgiving and Christmas in general
[03:11:09] <vaquero> biys:  im the same but i also recently came to the realization i dont really take care of my mental health, when i was studying counselling they would stress the importance of checking in with people and decompressing but when you learn how to handle your anxiety often people forget the work they did to get there
[03:11:49] <audrey> Mostly because both holidays emphasize family and good cheer and all that
[03:11:56] <audrey> (which are in short supply here in Audrey-land)
[03:12:00] <biys> my story goes something like...  when i got to a reasonable age where i started to realize that my anxiety was outside of the norm, i talked to a shrink for about 15 minutes one day
[03:12:05] <biys> he instantly put me on MMRI's
[03:12:14] <biys> i tried th em for about 2 months and found it made my body slow
[03:12:20] <audrey> biys: This was my experience as well. Damn.
[03:12:34] <biys> my mind still felt the same but my body was just hard to control and very unresponsive
[03:12:35] <audrey> They prescribed me Xanax after a single visit.
[03:13:19] <vaquero> that annoys me so much, why work with people to resolve issues when you can put them on a lifetime prescription
[03:13:21] <audrey> And some SSRIs ... none of it ever worked.
[03:13:33] <audrey> I kicked all of it years ago.
[03:14:04] <audrey> Unfortunately I´m stuck on other (non-psychiatric) meds for the rest of my life, but I´d rather have that be to a minimum.
[03:14:09] <audrey> Hate being dependent on pharmaceuticals.
[03:14:25] <biys> so SWIM works in HR
[03:14:46] <biys> and they were recently fired for absolutely no warning with no previous indicators of performance issues
[03:14:55] <biys> not even a blip on their radar in the entire time of working
[03:15:20] <biys> it comes down to district managers and HR sweeping human rights violations under the rug
[03:15:26] <audrey> SWIM?
[03:15:29] <biys> someone who isn't me
[03:15:32] <vaquero> i do think alot of people with proper mental health awareness and training can overcome there issues and not that i think no one should be on these pills but i see to many people being given pills as a bandaid for a fixable problem
[03:15:33] <audrey> Got it.
[03:15:56] <biys> SWIM had to do three investigations in the last 2 weeks about incidents that occured
[03:16:04] <biys> one of which is a clear case of sexual harassment
[03:16:06] <biys> the other is an assault
[03:16:20] <biys> the other is another case of sexual harassment, but is in the process of being proven
[03:16:29] *** Quits: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:16:39] <biys> the district managers are putting pressure on the people to make the problem go away
[03:17:01] <audrey> CYA mode seems to be in full swing.
[03:17:20] <audrey> I´ve seen similar things at places I´ve worked at in the past (perhaps not so extreme)
[03:17:44] <biys> it's interesting cause it seems like businesses are only providing lip service for the paradigm shift i see in the social consciousness
[03:18:00] <biys> lip service in that they masquerade as being "for the employee" so to speak
[03:18:09] <biys> but when it comes down to it they don't want the headache
[03:18:36] <biys> like i said though.  this person worked at the company for 8 years almost
[03:18:48] <biys> never had any performance issues or any kind of issues
[03:19:03] <biys> and after they suggested that the behaviour was indeed problematic and needs to be reported as such
[03:19:08] <biys> they were shown the foor
[03:19:09] <biys> door
[03:19:37] <vaquero> i use to work at a petstore where a young girl was sexually harassed, the regional managers solution was to move her to a store an hour away and not punish the manager at all. the manager ended up leaving for a better job even tho they protected him.
[03:19:52] <biys> vaquero: it
[03:19:55] <biys> it's amazing to me
[03:20:34] <biys> so here's kind of a theory i've come up with.  it's easy for managers to persuade their subordinates that something that is technically illegal isn't necessarily illegal
[03:20:48] <biys> and the subordinated tend to take the managers advice as credible
[03:20:50] <biys> why?
[03:21:02] <biys> well because they're the manager.  they're in a higher position, therefore they should have an elevated understanding
[03:21:05] <vaquero> cause the education system teaches you not to question authority
[03:21:13] <biys> it's kind of like when the police show up and tell you you "might" be doing somethign wrong
[03:21:17] <biys> so they need to "investigate"
[03:21:43] <biys> vaquero: that actually is another interesting point given the experience i've had in my literature class this week
[03:21:47] <biys> and i agree with that entirely
[03:21:49] <audrey> The way I see it, most of this new corporate social consciousness is little more than sloganeering. I compare it to the big signs that were constructed on top of buildings in Moscow in the 1970s with phrases such «Communism is the youth of the world». Few people believed any of it; it was just something you did in order to do business.

[03:23:18] <audrey> The only people who really believed it were the party apparatchiks, and you were always a little suspicious of someone who really believed slogans like that; there had to be something wrong with you if phrases like «The future is modernization of the kolkhozes» make you excited.
[03:24:12] <audrey> Though the US is very different in many respects, I see a lot of sociological similarities.
[03:24:18] <vaquero> audrey:  i feel like there are people who are so invested in there idea and belief of the state that they need to believe these slogans
[03:24:37] <audrey> Just replace the apparatchiks with HR directors, Title IX coordinators, and DEI managers.
[03:24:45] <biys> i can tell you i used to believe that police and the tactics used by police were reasonable
[03:24:55] <biys> after watching a few 1st amedment audit videos i'm not so sure anymore
[03:25:01] <biys> it seems like the police lie just to try and bang you up
[03:25:11] <audrey> Naw, everyone is in it for power and money.
[03:25:44] <audrey> The police are terrible in the US, no dispute there.
[03:26:03] <vaquero> biys:  plenty of stories of innocent men getting arrested cause the optics of having someone in custody is better than saying "we dont know who did it"

[03:28:06] <biys> kids are... nonsensicle
[03:28:20] <vaquero> they say nothing worth doing is easy
[03:28:32] <audrey> I think it´s great when children have a stay-at-home parent
[03:28:38] <audrey> It´s important, I think.
[03:28:46] <biys> i will be going back to work in beginning of january
[03:29:13] <audrey> I don´t have children but if I did, I would make a concerted effort to have one parent stay-at-home. (Also a fan of homeschooling, but that´s another topic.)
[03:29:16] <vaquero> audrey:  you mustnt be from a western country. all i ever see is people telling me 2 parents working is good and letting the government raise your kids is good.

[03:31:58] <audrey> biys: Gosh, that´s very difficult to answer. Russian literature is very broad.
[03:32:03] <biys> ikr
[03:32:13] <biys> and it depends on which era

[03:32:27] <audrey> Any way to narrow down the question, biys?
[03:32:38] <audrey> Was this a question you were asked, or?
[03:32:38] <biys> i think i'm going to pick a random time period
[03:32:47] <biys> like..  end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century
[03:32:52] <biys> modernism?  realism?
[03:33:18] <audrey> Soviet realist literature ... try «stilted»
[03:33:31] <biys> hahaha
[03:33:35] <biys> okay thanks
[03:33:43] <audrey> I´m joking, in case that wasn´t clear.
[03:33:57] <biys> i laughed at the single word beign used to summarize it
[03:33:59] <biys> i assumed it was a joke
[03:34:12] <audrey> I really don´t think it´s a meaningful question in the same way it wouldn´t be meaningful to ask what the dominant style of American literature is.
[03:34:22] <biys> i totally agree
[03:34:25] <biys> i think this instructor is an idiot
[03:34:39] <audrey> It´s a loaded question. It presupposes that the literature is uniform enough for such a general description.
[03:34:40] <biys> the other question i have to answer about russian literature is... how it's been "whitewashed"
[03:34:58] <audrey> Oh, is this some sort of university assignment?
[03:35:03] <audrey> What is «whitewashed»?
[03:35:10] <biys> it's for a literature class i've been taking
[03:35:17] <audrey> Oh my. You have my sympathies.
[03:35:21] <audrey> It sounds like a doozy.
[03:35:36] <audrey> mwsb: I approve of your life choices

[03:37:12] <biys> immediately.  hahaha
[03:37:12] <audrey> biys: The cynic in me wants to say that the question sounds like an attempt to impose modern Western socio-academic values on Russian culture

[03:42:29] <biys> i gotta rip this laptop apart and solder this charger directly to the board i think
[03:42:42] <biys> the barrel connector is completely pooched
[03:43:12] <audrey> biys: The only meaningful «whitewashing» I can think of, in the Russian context, is the Soviet attempt to reframe pre-1917 literature through an ideological lens.
[03:43:55] <biys> audrey: i ind of think that the way that the west used russian literature against russia by converting some of the anti-russian literature to english
[03:43:58] <audrey> My copy of Chekhov´s short stories, dated to sometime in the late 1960s, features a 30-page introduction talking about how Chekhov foresaw the collapse of the tsarist feudo-capitalist system and reflected proto-revolutionary ideals among the common population.
[03:44:01] <audrey> I´m not kidding.
[03:44:19] <biys> iirc there was even western funded initiatives to assist with it for the purpose of collapsing the ussr

[03:46:32] <vaquero> audrey:  which part are we groaning at?
[03:47:04] <audrey> biys: Oh, yes. The Western propaganda machine took full advantage of Solzhenitsyn and Zamjatin (among others, but those come to mind). That´s not in any way to impugn their talents as writers.
[03:47:33] <audrey> (I use propaganda in the old-fashioned sense here.)
[03:48:00] <audrey> vaquero: Just in general, not the kind of quality conversation we´re looking for here
[03:49:04] <vaquero> jokes arent for everybody
[03:49:05] <audrey> The joke about the weed was funny, though, I´ll grant that. :-D
[03:50:07] <vaquero> i was particularly fond of the born into greatness line. i love telling people to be a good patriot they need to do drugs
[03:50:57] <audrey> biys: I can´t be sure, but I think the reverse was true for left-leaning/establishment-critical writers in the United States (like Kurt Vonnegut), who were translated and published in the Soviet Union.
[03:51:34] <audrey> To a certain extent this is normal, and not a bad thing. Good literature is about the strength of its ideas (and ideals).
[03:52:37] *** Quits: I_Am_M00t (uid427178@id-427178.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[03:54:52] <vaquero> audrey:  whats your opinion on putin cause ive heard russians who talk about him being the great unifier who ended wars. which sounds insane when coming from a western background but i figure its easy to hate on him when arent living in these places.
[03:56:03] <audrey> Well, you can´t really trust what you read in the Western press about Putin´s domestic popularity.
[03:56:29] <audrey> The TLDR is that Putin is popular with anyone old enough to remember the societal upheaval in the 1990s.
[03:57:57] <audrey> Russia´s standard of living has drastically increased over the last 20 years, and most of the Russian public attributes that to Putin (especially contrasted with his predecessor, a blubbering womanizing alcoholic)
[03:58:02] <Thilastiko>   why cant nivalny challenge putin to a winner take all judo match?
[03:58:28] <Thilastiko> It would be like the last scene from Gladiator
[03:58:45] <audrey> Things have gotten a little more complicated over the last few years as the ruble has taken a tumble and the Russian economy is dependent on oil.
[03:59:18] <Thilastiko> only villains try to confuse you with complexities
[03:59:24] <Thilastiko> putin is a monster
[03:59:30] <Thilastiko> nivalny is a hero
[03:59:35] <Thilastiko> heroes kill monsters
[03:59:43] <audrey> Well, I would beg to differ, but to each his own, eh :3
[04:00:11] <Thilastiko> tou will have to beg pretty hard to convince anyone putin is anything but an evil monster
[04:00:19] <vaquero> Thilastiko:  in my mind if you desire power you prob aint a hero
[04:00:26] <audrey> Not that I particularly fawn over Putin. But it´s hard not to laugh to see the Western press try to lionize Navalny.
[04:00:43] <audrey> He´s an ultranationalist.
[04:01:15] <audrey> Basically, if you want to campaign in Russia and you´re not a member of United Russia (Putin´s party), the only place you can campaign is to the right of Putin.
[04:01:23] <Thilastiko> whatever nivalnys particualr platform, he is in jail because he believes in his principles. thats something puutin or any gopnik mobster would ever do
[04:01:35] <audrey> That´s because the left is already locked down by the Russian Communist Party (which has come in second in every single election since 1992).
[04:01:55] <vaquero> wait what
[04:01:56] <Thilastiko> do you think thats just a coincidence?
[04:02:13] <Thilastiko> this February would be another good time for a revolution
[04:02:16] <audrey> So, the only room for a political candidate to get any kind of mileage if he´s not a Communist, is to take the ultranationalist Slavic path.
[04:02:43] <audrey> There is absolutely no appetite in Russia for Western liberalism.
[04:02:47] <Thilastiko> why cant communist get elected? no beard?
[04:02:56] <audrey> Western liberalism, rightly or wrongly, is associated with the upheaval in the 1990s that I mentioned.
[04:03:25] <Thilastiko> russia also needs an education system
[04:03:43] <vaquero> so russia is still very pro commie?
[04:03:44] <audrey> Russia has one of the strongest education systems in the world, thank you very much. (One of the nicer inheritances from the Soviet Union.)
[04:04:20] <vaquero> i guess you can lead a horse to water but you cant stop it from creating a manmade famine
[04:04:21] <Thilastiko> botton line is, there is no other country on earth where so few people are harming the lives and futures of so many.
[04:04:55] <Thilastiko> than in russia. THat by itself is enough of a moral validation to hang putin and every member of his political party
[04:05:18] <Thilastiko> If US did it for iraq we can do it for russia
[04:05:36] <Bakunin> Thilastiko that's a moral argument
[04:05:40] <audrey> Thilastiko: I find your attitude patronizing and rather tiresome.
[04:05:41] <Bakunin> perhaps ethical
[04:06:08] <Thilastiko> Bakunin - do you care? youre an anarchist
[04:06:13] <vaquero> im so confused, i dont think anyone wants the US doing to russia what they did to iraq lol
[04:06:19] <Thilastiko> what justification do you need anyway?
[04:06:53] <Thilastiko> US can kill putin, whether the people can form a competent governent afterward is up to you
[04:07:03] <Bakunin> Yes I care.  I oppose Russian efforts wherever I find them, and it's pretty obvious the oligarchs would just cannibalize each other in the absence of their KGB head worm
[04:07:53] <Thilastiko> da
[04:07:54] <Bakunin> Unfortunately Russia has shown the world over the past 130 years that their nation is incapable of virtuous cycle.
[04:08:20] <Thilastiko> why not split it up into a few more "stans"
[04:08:24] <Bakunin> They prefer dictators ans mass murderers, sadly
[04:08:35] <audrey> This conversation is getting rather off-topic.
[04:08:45] <Thilastiko> install some babysitters for a few decades, like Japan and Germany
[04:08:47] <Bakunin> whats the topic
[04:08:50] <audrey> Let´s cut out the paranoia, please.
[04:09:33] <audrey> Take it to another channel if you must, but ##philosophy isn´t an appropriate place for wet dreams about political assassinations.
[04:09:48] <Bakunin> ##law might be good
[04:10:46] <Thilastiko> We were discussing the "metaethics" of shooting putin on the toilet
[04:10:50] <vaquero> i think you could make the argument that a moralistic debate about invading russia or killing putin would fall into philosophy
[04:11:08] <Bakunin> it would be depersonalized from putin, then
[04:11:55] <Bakunin> Any individual working a certain amount of pain and suffering on the world can be ethically murdered in a clear-cut case, with ethical impunity.
[04:12:37] <Thilastiko> I'm not saying there are good peopple or bad people. just some people are harming a large number of people in a major way. Its a practical problem
[04:12:43] <Bakunin> Invading Russia would be the worst of all possible moves, worse than just attempting containment
[04:13:02] <audrey> You guys should be applying to work for the CIA with paranoia like this.
[04:13:02] <Thilastiko> who needs to invade? drones my dude
[04:13:28] <Bakunin> audrey, the CIA isn't for moral or ethical people, it's for sociopaths
[04:13:46] <vaquero> audrey dont give the CIA any ideas, Thilastiko would be the perfect candidate for a "lone wolf" attacker to be set up
[04:13:46] <audrey> Anyway, I have serious doubts about whether this conversation is in good-faith so once again I will ask you to move the entire talk to another channel.
[04:13:50] <Thilastiko> I want to live in a orld where politicians are forced to live in underground tunnels. And have to beg the poulace not totkill them
[04:13:51] <audrey> Bakunin: Touché.

[05:05:13] <Bakunin> so it turned into dick jokes
[05:05:30] <Bakunin> which you woke up just in time to ... turbate
[05:05:46] * Parf rubs his chin
[05:05:50] <Parf> taking action against bad people
[05:06:01] <Parf> sounds like anarchy. isn't that what we have laws for
[05:06:06] <Bakunin> Really, the only irony here is that audrey said she was giving this channel up about six months ago, but that's not important anymore, since she hasnt
[05:06:25] <Parf> don't talk shit on Audrey. she's a beautiful person
[05:06:26] <Bakunin> and maintains very strict boundaries on chat, per her preferences
[05:06:45] <Bakunin> She's a russophile, so she probably resembles Ayn Rand in the later years
[05:06:54] * Parf likes to hope so
[05:07:13] <Parf> i'm not talking only skin deep besides
[05:07:47] <Bakunin> I, too, prefer to live on public dole while antagonizing the public against dole-takers
[05:07:52] <Bakunin> :)
[05:08:07] <Parf> she was an interesting cat, rand
[05:08:22] <Atque> Parf: My sense is all you feel is shame, and you were sad when she walked away. Is that philosophical though?
[05:08:41] * Parf looks atque
[05:08:48] <Parf> when who walked away?
[05:09:32] * Parf extends his legs as greengald, misshapen, crablike
[05:09:37] <Atque> Parf: Some unrequited love
[05:10:01] <Parf> just plunging your dagger into someone else's back, then are we? or aiming at mind and finding only empty promises

[05:12:46] <Bakunin> the best story about Ayn, ever
[05:13:43] <Bakunin> "[copies of Atlas Shrugged] good for weighting down decoupage projects, although when it comes to slugging a nurse over the head when I want to sneak out to buy booze, nothing beats my signed first edition of “The Fountainhead”. Mind you, it might be easier just to read it to them. Whoo, what a stinker it is. Temazepam in libric form."

[06:16:17] <Bakunin> On July 21, 1972, George Carlin was arrested and charged with violating obscenity laws after performing his famous "Seven Dirty Words" routine at Milwaukee's Summerfest. He would go on to be arrested a total of seven times for reciting that same routine.
[06:16:39] <Thilastiko> Fucking hero
[06:16:58] <Bakunin> when "free speech" was important to cultural growth
[06:17:20] <Bakunin> Lenny Bruce laid his track, too
[06:17:24] <Bakunin> he was in a tradition
[06:17:41] <Thilastiko> what would they think of us now? they would be soo ashamed
[06:17:52] <Bakunin> Chapelle in the same one, but he's post-climax.  The tug you don't want in refractory.
[06:18:21] <Thilastiko> "tug in the refractory"
[06:18:24] <Thilastiko> ?
[06:18:30] <Bakunin> nah Carlin is famous for this:  "Think of how stupid the average person is.  Then realize, half of us are dumber than THAT."
[06:18:59] <Bakunin> yes.  After a man climaxes, he enters a refractory period, where stimulation is unwanted and feels bad
[06:19:09] <Thilastiko> The trumps are a good 3 SDs below average
[06:19:10] <Bakunin> so
[06:19:27] <Bakunin> "free speech" culture was about breaking down walls of artificial division
[06:19:30] <Bakunin> puritanism
[06:19:39] <Bakunin> not making genocide cool and okay
[06:19:57] <Bakunin> so Chapelle shows up, after the Climax of the Period of Comedy typified by Carlin
[06:20:08] <Bakunin> and complains about LGBT
[06:20:10] <Thilastiko> Christianity is just what happens when the racist win
[06:20:18] <Thilastiko> their motto is "
[06:20:28] <Bakunin> buddy i have a great cartoon for you, gimme a min
[06:20:31] <Thilastiko> its not racist if you commit genocide too"

[06:26:30] <Thilastiko> but anyway, soo many terms in christianity are actually racist slurs agains now extinct near eastern ethnicities
[06:26:44] <Thilastiko> calling someone a "philistine" is just an insult now
[06:26:49] <Bakunin> uh sorry i did a huge twitter bender and i cannot find it
[06:27:02] <Bakunin> it was drawn in Family Guy cartoon style
[06:27:07] <Thilastiko> no problemma bro, its the thought that counts
[06:27:44] <Bakunin> an elephant and a penguin, the elephant was labelled "Capitalism" and the penguin was named "Colonialism" in the first frame, and Noah is sending them out
[06:27:52] <vaquero> Bakunin:  you think chapelle is making genocide cool?
[06:28:21] <Bakunin> in the second frame, he returns, and there's a penguin with an elephant head named Fascism, and Noahs' grilling Capitalism and Colonialism:  "What the fuck is this?"
[06:29:08] <Thilastiko> ahh, the ole "animals fucking" meme
[06:29:13] <Thilastiko> hilarious
[06:29:26] <Bakunin> Thilastiko problematically, judaism is tied with the transition from oral to written tradition
[06:30:10] <Thilastiko> thats what modern jews say -that there was an oral tradition along with the ancient written tradition of the pentateuch
[06:30:42] <Bakunin> yeah so you're mad at words, but this gang made up the concept of "words" in the persistent sense
[06:30:56] <Thilastiko> is probably bullshit, the whole isrealite tradition was massivly polythieistic and unstructured until josiah
[06:30:57] <Bakunin> winners write history, remember
[06:31:10] <Bakunin> yeah but I'm talkin Moses
[06:31:30] <Thilastiko> the isrealites were probably the most ignorant literate culture
[06:31:40] <Bakunin> unrelated, but hilarious https://twitter.com/realPhoenixFire/status/1460775476067282957

[06:31:50] <Thilastiko> world would have been better off if it was just an oral tradition
[06:32:01] <Bakunin> Thilastiko also possibly an explanation of them thriving
[06:32:28] <Thilastiko> when have jew ever thrived?
[06:32:31] <audrey> Bakunin: I don' t recall ever declaring I would be leaving the channel.
[06:32:42] <audrey> There was someone trying to impersonate me around that time so it might have been then.
[06:32:47] <Thilastiko> they are just a xenophobic subculture across eurasia
[06:32:57] <Thilastiko> like the gypsys
[06:34:03] <Thilastiko> if their literature wasnt weaponized by the late roman empire they would already be extinct culture
[06:34:21] <Bakunin> no you were giving up moderation at least
[06:34:24] <Bakunin> you said as much
[06:34:35] <audrey> I might have said I was going to take a break.
[06:34:46] <audrey> Definitely not renouncing ownership.
[06:35:13] <audrey> Ah well. Not a big deal.
[06:35:20] <Bakunin> yes thats obvious :)
[06:35:32] <Thilastiko> just to be clear - Judaism is the bullshit.

[06:36:11] <Thilastiko> I love knish
[06:36:21] <vaquero> Thilastiko:  sounds like a typical anti-Semite trying to back peddle. just call them small hats next time
[06:37:00] <audrey> Thilastiko: Take the hostility and the antisemitism elsewhere.
[06:37:01] <Thilastiko> "jews" as genetic lineage is a non-monopheletig group. e.g. ther is no jewish "race"
[06:37:32] <Bakunin> Whenever I criticize Israel, people call me an anti-semite, whether I'm living with a jew and observing high holies with them or not
[06:37:44] <Thilastiko> people in the jewish tradition jut strategically call anyone who critizes their bullshit religion aantisemitic
[06:37:48] <Bakunin> I figured that stupidity out real fast
[06:38:21] <Bakunin> if you get called an antisemite when you're not a fascist, 90% of the time they're too dumb, or 10% of the time they're the fascist
[06:38:36] <Thilastiko> "semitic" is a language group, so antisemitic really means you are against the hebrew and arabic languages... which is stupid
[06:38:58] <Bakunin> Thilastiko only western ashkenazi are like that, really
[06:39:03] <Bakunin> but they are the majority
[06:39:07] <vaquero> Bakunin:  hey i get called a white supremacist while planning having a mixed race child with my fiance,  these terms are more labels for the user to categorize you than anything else

[18:06:20] <kmh> i mean i have dseen similar tactics against males
[18:07:09] <kmh> on that subject or similar ones other than supposed transphobis, they often used racism or antosemitism
[18:07:58] <kmh> finkelstein got denied tenure that way and that darkb web biology professor from someborthwestern college
[18:08:20] <kmh> they were both male
[18:09:05] <audrey> kmh: I mean, I'm open to being wrong about this. I just don't see people going around making rape threats against men they disagree with quite so casually.
[18:09:06] <kmh> and apparently Duke tenund tenure now to Nikole Hannah-Jones  over "CRT" stuff
[18:09:36] <audrey> To me there is a decided element of misogyny with a lot of this toilet bowl-level twitter discourse.
[18:10:00] <kmh> audrey,  the (male) biology prof resigned because he got aggressively hackled by students as well
[18:10:23] <audrey> Did they threaten to shove body parts into his bigoted orifices?

[18:12:06] <kmh> in finkelstein's case i'm not sure but i bet he got death threats
[18:12:23] <audrey> Yeah. It's the rape threats that fascinate me the most, though.

[18:15:55] <audrey> (re: "considered gay")
[18:16:03] <arryana> the rape threat is pathetic.  it's always a feeble attempt to dehumanize a woman into a sexual object.

[18:22:50] <pussipupu> Honestly I've had death threats on IRC from people who gendered me both male and female, but think I've only had rape threats from people who gendered me female, only an anecdote of course, but fits the apparent pattern
[18:23:26] <arryana> huh.  i've never had a death threat, but i've had a lot of rape threats

[18:27:23] <arryana> that sort of person is just pitiful
[18:28:21] <audrey> If you want to make a generic insult toward a man, it seems the only way is to compare the man to a woman.
[18:28:27] <audrey> Hence, "male Karen", "sissy", etc.
[18:28:32] <arryana> yeah
[18:28:45] <pussipupu> The problem of how to fund journalism is sadly a big one, honestly I expected micropayments to become more of a thing

[19:04:38] <arryana> i don't mind homework seekers if they're in a room which caters to such things.  i find it rude and annoying if they interrupt to demand answers in a general room, though.
[19:05:50] <pussipupu> Well, there's a world of difference between trying to weedle the answers out of people and asking for help with understanding things
[19:05:57] <arryana> agreed
[19:05:59] <kmh> pussipupu,  yes i occasionally used it myself for that purpose
[19:06:09] <pussipupu> The latter is IMO laudable, whether for homework or otherwise
[19:06:23] <pussipupu> I've had help on IRC with my Finnish studies for instance
[19:06:35] <pussipupu> Though I still suck at Finnish, make of that what you will :þ
[19:07:04] <kmh> and in particular in mint channels you can still find anything from highschoolers to university profs
[19:07:12] <kmh> and everything in between
[19:08:00] <kmh> pussipupu,  so you still gotta finish Finnish?
[19:08:33] <pussipupu> I've not finished English, so there seems little hope of that...

[19:22:17] <audrey> Yes, she was "jailbait" if I ever saw such a thing.
[19:22:27] <audrey> Perhaps she read too much Nabokov and thought it was an instruction manual.
[19:22:40] <audrey> (Or perhaps she really is an FBI agent.)

[19:38:07] <audrey> But all are very high level literature. (Though I have to say, Catcher in the Rye lost a bit of its depth on a second reading. I think it's the sort of book you read when you're 17 and burnt out about the world)

[19:51:19] <arryana> literature is supposed to cover the gamut of human experience.  or maybe i was just introduced to 'shocking' literature too young to be shocked.

[20:03:21] * arryana nods
[20:03:35] <arryana> my mom didn't care what we read as long as we didn't get complaints at school over it
[20:03:37] <audrey> I remember one time we visited my grandparents, and there were some books there that we didn't have at home - Vonnegut, Woody Allen short stories, etc.
[20:03:45] <arryana> but again, with all of us, she was steamrolled.
[20:03:46] <audrey> So I started casually leafing through them and thought they were great.
[20:03:48] <arryana> we did what we wanted, largely.
[20:03:52] <audrey> Then a few days later the books disappeared.
[20:04:02] <arryana> oooh, i love vonnegut
[20:04:09] <arryana> yeah, that's a crappy lesson for a kid
[20:04:16] <audrey> Later I figured out my mom had caught wind and "confiscated" those books and replaced them with "wholesome literature"
[20:04:37] <audrey> I was around fourteen at the time.
[20:04:38] *** Joins: CyberTailor (~CyberTail@5.1.53.225)
[20:04:52] <arryana> bleh
[20:04:58] <audrey> Oh yeah, she also confiscated Orwell's 1984.
[20:05:04] <arryana> a 14 year old should be allowed to read anything they can comprehend
[20:05:05] <audrey> I secretly went to a library later and finished reading it.
[20:05:20] <arryana> that's an age they deserve a conversation, not a ban
[20:05:32] <audrey> Later, when I was 17 or so, I brought Catch-22 home from the library and my mom secretly read parts of it and tried to get rid of it too
[20:05:42] <arryana> yeesh
[20:05:59] <audrey> But at that point my father put his foot down and I overheard them having a conversation about how "she's not a child anymore and this is very good literature"
[20:06:12] <arryana> good.
[20:06:17] <audrey> So I was "allowed" to finish it.
[20:06:30] <audrey> Though by that time we had Internet and I think I could have probably found a copy online if I tried hard enough.
[20:06:46] <arryana> i can't think of any literature that i feel was damaging to me when i was young
[20:07:11] <arryana> the first movie i found emotionally disturbing was the deer hunter
[20:07:27] <audrey> I bet my mom opened the book to the chapter that referenced anal sex
[20:07:34] <audrey> and immediately assumed the rest of the book was like that
[20:07:45] <arryana> but that wasn't a movie for an eight year old, or however old i was when i saw it
[20:07:54] <arryana> something on that order.  under 10 for sure
[20:07:55] <audrey> Can't have our little seventeen-year-old getting ideas about sodomy, after all.
[20:07:59] <arryana> haha
[20:08:05] <urishgirl> :D
[20:08:28] <audrey> Oh, I love me a controversial artsy movie.
[20:08:35] <arryana> it's a wonderful film
[20:08:48] <arryana> but i didn't have the equipment to process some of the imagery for a few years
[20:08:48] <audrey> Midnight Cowboy, Last Tango in Paris, Easy Rider are some of my favorites
[20:08:59] <audrey> But yeah none of those are for under-12s in my book
[20:10:03] <audrey> Marlon Brando in particular just knocked it out of the goddamn park IMO
[20:10:12] <arryana> i can't say i'm sorry i watched it, but no book ever bothered me the way that movie did.
[20:10:20] <audrey> Sadly that style of filmmaking went out after Star Wars
[20:10:30] <arryana> i think parents would be better off limiting what kids watch and letting them read whatever they can mentally embrace
[20:10:38] <arryana> shame, too
[20:10:47] <arryana> i mean that it went out of fashion.
[20:10:49] <arryana> i agree with you
[20:11:13] <audrey> I mean you have movies like Blue is the Warmest Color that try to mimic the intense emotional charge of Last Tango in Paris
[20:11:20] <audrey> but modern film directors just don't have the skill to pull it off
[20:11:28] <audrey> because you can't shock your audiences simply with the plotline anymore
[20:11:51] <audrey> I want to get some movie posters for those films.
[20:11:57] <audrey> A lot of them are on eBay but quite expensive.
[20:12:07] <kmh> audrey, no point i was just ecalling the 2 kids i've seen on irc and pointing out you know one of them as well
[20:13:22] <audrey> kmh: Yeah. pnint is very mature for her age. Though I worry she's susceptible to getting manipulated by some predatory man online.
[20:13:28] <kmh> audrey,  if you are looking for interestingly colored movies I recommend "Picnic at hanging rock"
[20:13:46] <kmh> audrey,  right that was her nick
[20:14:12] <kmh> audrey,  well she's about adult by now and studying afaik
[20:15:09] <kmh> audrey, also interingly colored is zhang yimou's Hero andkuroswa's dreams
[20:20:21] <audrey> "You know, what the hell, I'm no prize. I picked up a nailin Cuba in '48 and I have a prostate like a Russet potato and I can't have kids, though I am a pretty good stick-man. I suppose if I hadn't met you I would have settled for a rocking chair and a hemorrhoid."
[20:20:35] <audrey> - Paul in Last Tango in Paris
[20:20:56] <audrey> IDK, this sort of script walks a fine line between banal and idiotic and brilliant
[20:21:07] <audrey> and I can't think of many film directors today who would pull this off
