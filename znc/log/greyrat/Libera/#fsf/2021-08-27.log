[16:36:50] <DiffieHellman> The main issue is that emoji's have colour, which is insane for a font. A symbol is fine, but don't make that symbol a bitmap.
[16:37:25] <opal> it isnt a bitmap
[16:37:37] <opal> also youre just trying to trigger me saying emoji's arent you
[16:38:09] <joepublic> how a color illustration isn't rendered as a bitmap is confusing me a little
[16:42:19] <belgin> it's like a svg, not a bitmap, because it has to scale properly
[16:43:34] <belgin> here's an interesting take on software dependencies https://nitter.fdn.fr/cmuratori/status/1426299131270615040
[16:43:52] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, depends on implementation really. I should have said; "but don't make that symbol an image with colours as good luck applying, underline, italics etc as one does with text"
[16:44:56] <DiffieHellman> belgin: This is precisely why I write in assembly without those bloat libraries
[16:45:00] <belgin> tl;dr if your software project has dozens or hundreds of dependencies, you will spend most of the time working on getting it to build
[16:45:25] <DiffieHellman> Yes, I keep running into programs like this on Gentoo.
[16:46:21] <belgin> i find it funny that with just 10 dependencies, each having a (very high) 90% chance of still working after 1 year, in 5 years your software will almost certainly not build
[16:46:44] <belgin> if you take that formula as being true, that is
[16:46:54] <DiffieHellman> If you write your program correctly, that can be a one line fix, if not, good luck.
[16:48:32] <DiffieHellman> JavaScript based programs solve this issue by pinning exact versions of libraries for all eternity. I looked at the VS Code deps and saw multiple versions of isEven of course.
[16:48:50] <opal> if libraries arent shit then that formula doesnt apply

[16:49:15] <belgin> yes, most software is garbage, and it's getting worse
[16:49:45] <belgin> it's getting quadratically worse because as software quality drops, at the same time more and more things have software in them

[17:05:26] <DiffieHellman> In my option, if you want a secure program, you need to write yourself a mathematical proof and check that over every single line and function.

[20:05:04] <kilobug> kreyren[m]: because any algorithm/feature/... which is patented can't be included in a FLOSS, it would require every user and every modified copy to negotiate somehow a patent license
[20:05:14] <Noisytoot> kreyren[m], they restrict your freedom to write software
[20:05:43] <kreyren[m]> Do you have some article on it that i can propose to them

[21:43:52] <usernumber9> Hello all, I'm new, I joined last week but have been spending my time looking over the fsd and the Participate link. I'm starting from the beginning of the FSD (first entry is 0AD) to update info on cryptocurrency donation status. Is there anyone working on that right now so that I don't duplicate efforts? It would be great if there was a way to filter the FSD by projects that do/don't accept crypto. Of course
[21:43:55] <usernumber9> the ones that "don't accept it" would be the ones we would want to verify I guess, and maybe check the URL of the ones that do. Is anyone out there working on this at all or have any input for me? Thanks
[21:43:56] <juus> Noisytoot: thanks. I'm a bit new to all this...
[21:46:08] <craigt> usernumber9: Hello and welcome back. Let's take a look. I have not spent much time looking at the donation fields.
[21:46:26] <usernumber9> craigt: thanks
[21:49:43] <craigt> usernumber9: You are probably safe pursuing the crypto status, I don't think you will be duplicating any efforts.
[21:50:16] <kuber> craigt, i have read the Participation Guidelines. Please provide information related to Enties that require Entry, Edit or Deletion..
[21:52:53] <usernumber9> okey doke I'll start looking through. I'm wondering, would it be outside of scope that, if a project doesn't accept crypto, to ask them about plans to do so?
[21:53:24] <usernumber9> craigt: sorry I meant to tag you in my response. I'm not very experienced with irc

[22:04:59] <adfeno> usernumber9: About spreadsheet or something to that effort to track the status, that can be done, but currently requires querying using Semantic Mediawiki. I'll do some quick help to the team at hand and give you the link of my contribution.

[23:25:09] <usernumber9> adfeno: quick question, the page you linked to has 346 entries that, if I understand correctly, are projects that don't accept crypto. I changed the filter value to true to see an example of a page that accepts crypto and it only comes back with 15 entries. Being that there are over 16,000 entries in the FSD does that mean that the rest of the projects don't have a true or a false in the 'Accepts cryptocurrency
[23:25:10] <usernumber9> donations' parameter? Maybe I can change the URL to be filter='' or something to get the remaining entries...
[23:25:47] <adfeno> usernumber9: all entries that have no donations checked are already set to false
[23:26:18] <adfeno> There should not be any entries that have blank option, since "false" is the default.
[23:26:41] <usernumber9> adfeno: I see now, initially I thought the query was for those that were in question.
[23:27:21] *** Quits: qbt (~edun@user/edun) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:27:34] <usernumber9> got it. When i run it wide open with filter= it returns the total 362 that is 346 + 15.
[23:27:38] <adfeno> Semantic MediaWiki cannot search for the absense of a property, so we took that into account when making the form that fills "Accepts cryptocurrency" donations, and set the default to "false".
[23:28:44] <usernumber9> am I mistaken about the 16k number, or am I only concerning myself with entries that are candidates to become entries in the fsd?
[23:29:07] <adfeno> Oh, I see what you mean now.
[23:29:12] <adfeno> I'll do some checks.
[23:29:30] <usernumber9> my math is off but the one is accounted for somewhere lol
[23:29:41] <usernumber9> thanks
[23:30:08] <adfeno> Hm...
[23:30:24] <adfeno> OK, it seems that you are right.
[23:30:45] <craigt> This wraps up another great meeting. Thanks everybody! See you next week.
