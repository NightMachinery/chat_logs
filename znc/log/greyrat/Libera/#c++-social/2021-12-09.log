[00:09:19] <Bullit> cause point wise values are being ignored to a substantial level, nearly 2 million shots fired with a counterstrike source weapon the M16, the score was devided by 10 and there is a rumourous debate about 199999 as result
[00:14:04] <Renderwww> T`aZ failed the reverse turing test, he can't tell if someone is a bot or not
[01:18:39] <hinst> The stuff bull-it posts seems to be a text generated from sentences; where only one word is used to put the output together, and not ML
[01:19:23] <hinst> Like, if word was in source sentence A and it was also in source sentence B then this word may connect two others in the outputted sentence
[01:20:41] <hinst> Cats say meow. Dogs say bark. The word SAY is in both sentences; therefore I generate: Dogs say meow
[01:20:47] <hinst> That is what I think it does.

[12:56:25] <hinst> Good day
[12:56:39] <Faux> Morning.
[13:00:15] <markuskj> i'd say day
[13:10:22] <T`aZ> slow day
[13:12:12] <hinst> I say, and no mistake
[13:13:12] <jotham> yep i think everyone at work has given up for christmas
[13:13:12] <Faux> Snow day.
[13:13:16] <jotham> had almost no emails today
[13:13:23] <jotham> and one annoying email chain of 100~ emails 
[13:13:26] <jotham> that was sluggish
[13:13:37] <jotham> it's summer here, so christmas is a fucked time of year
[13:13:41] <jotham> everyone just fucks off 
[13:13:45] <jotham> and it's too hot for anyone to think
[13:13:51] <jotham> (AC isn't common here)
[13:14:32] <Faux> (among poor people)
[13:14:44] <jotham> oh yeah sure rich people have all the mod cons
[13:14:58] <jotham> but no one with a job is a rich person
[13:15:30] <Faux> I dunno whether I want AC fitted here. I worry the stress of maintaining it is going to outweigh the benefits of it taking the edge off our like three hot weeks a year, which are hardly hot by anyone else's standards.
[13:15:46] <Faux> I ordered thermal / foil-backed blinds so I can look like a proper growhouse.
[13:15:54] <jotham> good
[13:33:56] <T`aZ> i cant imagine having christmas in summer
[13:41:27] <jotham> yeah it's very strange
[13:41:45] <jotham> cause all our cultural programming is this big red prick and snow and winter inside with muleld wine etc
[13:41:48] <jotham> cause we got it off you guys
[13:41:51] <jotham> except it's 30C
[13:42:51] <T`aZ> you cant properly over eat and drink the whole day if it's 30°
[13:46:24] <jotham> usually have chicken and a salad as an early lunch then get drunk and have a swim
[13:46:58] <jotham> christmas is def fucked here

[14:30:51] <Carbonflux> well, your not missing much really.
[14:31:54] <Carbonflux> normally in the US we just exchange guns.
[14:38:59] <Carbonflux> the BBC says you guys are banning smoking jotham 
[14:39:10] <jotham> Industry data and firearms background checks show nearly 23 million guns were purchased in 2020, according to Small Arms Analytics, a consulting firm based in Greenville, South Carolina.
[14:39:18] <jotham> there is no way for a european to understand that
[14:39:25] <jotham> there are so many guns in america
[14:39:30] <jotham> banning them would never fix it
[14:39:50] <jotham> it'd require a psychological revelation that the europeans could never have
[14:39:53] <jotham> which sounds good
[14:40:06] <jotham> maybe extreme passivism could emerge in america
[14:40:14] <jotham> instead of post ww2 europe
[14:40:19] <jotham> nature does what it does right
[14:40:23] <jotham> tries every single plan
[14:40:33] <jotham> banning guns is a dumb argument
[14:40:40] <jotham> have to figure out how to live with war
[14:40:55] <jotham> yeah Carbonflux we're banning smoking for people under 14 forever
[14:41:05] <jotham> and it's going to cause the collapse of a lot of corner stores
[14:41:15] <jotham> which the neolibs that rule us don't care about
[14:41:19] <Carbonflux> well, Buddhism is a civilization destroying virus, its getting more popular here all the time.
[14:41:23] <jotham> but the country as a whole agrees with
[14:41:30] <jotham> but i also think it's the final push into big-vape
[14:41:33] <jotham> did you see tghis
[14:41:41] <jotham> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juul#Investors
[14:41:51] <jotham> phillip moris owns 35% of juul
[14:42:12] <jotham> i think of our new law change as a setup to get the kids onto the new safer addictive drugs
[14:42:18] <jotham> not the old less safe addictive drugs
[14:42:35] <jotham> nailed it
[14:43:16] <Carbonflux> ya, its like pharma and tobacco are merging, same logic.
[14:43:55] <jotham> i don't think nz banning smoking is anything other than a political football that mostly serves the chemical companies producing teen vape devices
[14:44:00] <jotham> which aren't at all illegal
[14:44:14] <Carbonflux> i see that
[14:46:10] <jotham> i figure everyones dedcided growing nicotine in plantations is super inefficient
[14:46:22] <jotham> and they could go to bioreactors and $1 usb devices
[14:46:30] <jotham> which juul has nailed
[14:46:44] <jotham> which will lead to massive profits
[14:47:16] <jotham> Carbonflux: you absolutely must think of nz as a tony blair neoliberal utopia where only land value is protected, rather than the socialist wasteland we get painted as
[14:47:44] <Carbonflux> what is driving that?
[14:47:46] <jotham> the right wing are so far off the truth it's bizzare, and i strongly believe it's because we have a female leader, and men go retarded when a woman is in charge
[14:47:52] <jotham> even if she's just doing neoliberal norms
[14:48:10] <jotham> her p1's are
[14:48:19] <jotham> ensuring house prices go up
[14:48:32] <jotham> and ensuring she doesn't fall out of favor by fucking up covid
[14:48:46] <jotham> and possibly investing a bit more into marginalised poverty
[14:49:12] <jotham> everyone screams she was a socialist when she was 16
[14:49:19] <jotham> which you and i know is a facile argument
[14:49:31] <jotham> i had some dreams when i was 16 that i would actively refute now
[14:49:34] <jotham> so does everyone
[14:49:52] <Carbonflux> she said "safe alternatives"
[14:50:01] <jotham> i hate the idea that people think the american democrats and the nz neolibs are some how the party of workers and economic parity
[14:50:04] <jotham> it's just not true
[14:50:17] <jotham> can you give me the context of that statement
[14:50:33] <jotham> you know even though we both speak english we don't live the same culture
[14:50:44] <jotham> that's a massive problem of our modern internet age
[14:50:51] <Carbonflux> who says that?
[14:50:57] <jotham> explain the context
[14:51:36] <Carbonflux> i have never heard anyone say that.
[14:51:43] <jotham> explain the context
[14:51:55] <jotham> i can't respond to what you are saying without knowing about the situation
[14:52:13] <Carbonflux> your pm said that
[14:52:24] <Carbonflux> it made me think of the juul thing
[14:52:25] <jotham> right, link her talk
[14:52:34] <Carbonflux> it was on the BBC just now
[14:52:36] <jotham> i need to know the context of what she said
[14:52:42] <jotham> well link me it
[14:52:48] <jotham> everything is on their radio website
[14:52:52] <Carbonflux> i can't, its a live stream
[14:53:00] <jotham> it'll be business daily
[14:53:02] <jotham> or news hour
[14:53:05] <jotham> or something
[14:53:08] <jotham> what was the show
[14:53:10] <Carbonflux> ya it was news hour
[14:53:41] <Carbonflux> anyway, it seemed to confirm what you saying above
[14:55:03] <jotham> they are just talking about pedophiles
[14:55:09] <Carbonflux> they did a whole segment on it, the BBC does seem to find restrictions interesting.
[14:55:10] <jotham> what concerned you
[14:55:33] <jotham> i find nz gets used as kicking toy by foreign countries with their own problems
[14:55:39] <jotham> and i think most of it is sexist
[14:56:00] <jotham> i get linked by weird right wing foreigners about jacinda being a woman regularly
[14:56:09] <jotham> anyway that's not the point here
[14:56:34] <jotham> i don't know what you mean by safe alternative
[14:56:44] <jotham> listening to the last news hour now
[14:57:41] <jotham> our rules are less strict than the uk ones
[14:58:12] <jotham> and i don't think you can compare american rules
[14:58:24] <jotham> because uk and nz aren't federal
[14:58:25] <Carbonflux> thats what she said, i don't know what she means either but it did seem like she was referring to vapping based on what you said about juul/
[14:58:42] <jotham> oh so it wasn't about covid
[14:58:52] <jotham> thought you were talking about omicron
[14:58:55] <Carbonflux> no, smoking
[14:59:00] <Carbonflux> heh
[14:59:00] <jotham> which is an active planet killing plague
[14:59:07] <jotham> well who the fuck cares about her view on smoking
[14:59:11] <Carbonflux> heh
[14:59:28] <Carbonflux> Covid is not planet killing
[14:59:41] <jotham> she wants to look like she cares about kids because that's her portfolio
[14:59:48] <Carbonflux> more people die from hunger than covid.
[14:59:54] <jotham> but like i said all this law will do is ensure vape makers earn heaps
[14:59:58] <jotham> so she's being a good neolib
[15:00:00] <jotham> which she is
[15:00:06] <jotham> right wing americans don't get that
[15:00:12] <jotham> she's a perfect capitalist mother fucker
[15:00:49] <jotham> your democratic party is neolib
[15:00:51] <jotham> same as her
[15:00:55] <jotham> nothing socialist about it
[15:00:56] <Carbonflux> well, she seems to think she can fix the world.
[15:01:05] <jotham> protect property prices
[15:01:10] <jotham> protect labour taxation
[15:01:25] <jotham> that's not true Carbonflux 
[15:01:37] <jotham> she has very discrete things she's tried to fix
[15:01:47] <jotham> and our country would say has largely failed at
[15:01:51] <jotham> i'd still vote for her again
[15:01:54] <jotham> and did last time
[15:02:04] <jotham> it's not a rock star complex like americans have with the president
[15:02:09] <jotham> you have to understand that
[15:02:10] <Carbonflux> well, she seems to want more live people, for some reason
[15:02:17] <jotham> sure
[15:02:33] <jotham> but she wants to protect realestate
[15:02:34] <Carbonflux> what will all these people do?
[15:02:36] <jotham> and also kids
[15:02:54] <jotham> sounds like a classic rich socilite to me???
[15:02:57] <Carbonflux> they will sit in their homes and be safe.
[15:03:00] <jotham> doing her charity work?
[15:03:08] <jotham> you guys have misunderstood this entire thing
[15:03:24] <Carbonflux> which guys do you mean?
[15:03:29] <jotham> that's totally not true
[15:03:39] <jotham> only some 20-30% of nz can sit at home
[15:03:47] <jotham> that's why we blocked our international borders
[15:03:58] <jotham> it's a very entitled idea to think that everyone can sit at home
[15:04:06] <jotham> that's why we went hermit kingdom
[15:04:50] <Carbonflux> well, its not safe to get out bed tho, at some point its going to be mandatory that you stay in bed all day.
[15:05:05] <jotham> i think it's dumb that this tiny country with no money at the end of the world
[15:05:05] <Carbonflux> or in a life support pod.
[15:05:09] <jotham> is a political football
[15:05:12] <jotham> by the richest countries
[15:05:19] <jotham> you guys might need to just sort your shit out
[15:05:23] <jotham> and stop being fucking morons
[15:05:38] <Carbonflux> i don't think anyone really cares about NZ 
[15:05:54] <jotham> but i get linked daily by foreign people about how my pm is shit and how we're running conentration camps or whatever
[15:06:00] <jotham> you guys might need to sort your shit out
[15:06:03] <jotham> really really badly
[15:06:04] <Carbonflux> its not like you have nukes or something
[15:06:13] <jotham> we're a media sensation
[15:06:19] <jotham> constantly since the pandemic started
[15:06:29] <jotham> it's just a machine to talk about your own cultural failures
[15:06:33] <jotham> and it's very dumb
[15:06:43] <Carbonflux> hm, i only hear the crazy stuff you guys do, like the extreme lockdowns and banning smoking.
[15:06:49] <jotham> right
[15:06:51] <jotham> crazy stuff
[15:06:56] <jessicara> concentration camps?
[15:06:58] <jotham> having a largely safe compliant country
[15:07:00] <jotham> with no deaths
[15:07:05] <jessicara> isn't what i heard..
[15:07:08] <jotham> you are literally structured to demonize nz
[15:07:12] <jotham> because of your own politics
[15:07:16] <jotham> it's got nothing to do with us
[15:07:23] <jotham> yeah jessicara 
[15:07:25] <jotham> also hi jessicara 
[15:07:26] <jessicara> what i heard is that nz dealt with it rather well at first
[15:07:42] <jotham> we have delta and it's under 100 cases a day for 2 weeks
[15:07:49] <jotham> for 6 million people
[15:07:56] <jotham> and we're basically 90% vaccinated
[15:07:59] <jotham> 12+ 
[15:08:07] <jotham> everything you hear is just bullshit media beatups
[15:08:08] <Carbonflux> they just made themselves virgin territory for the virus.
[15:08:13] <jotham> because countries want their own political fights
[15:08:21] <jotham> we're a very cohesive complaint country
[15:08:27] <Carbonflux> you don't fight a virus as if it was a war 
[15:08:28] <jotham> and there are no human rights violations
[15:08:42] <jotham> you guys have just made us a dumb boogie man
[15:08:49] <jotham> like probably south korea and south vietnam
[15:09:04] <jessicara> sk did rather well too
[15:09:08] <jotham> can i just say
[15:09:10] <jotham> for the record 
[15:09:12] <jotham> Carbonflux
[15:09:14] <jotham> please
[15:09:17] <jotham> do whatever the fuck you want
[15:09:18] <jotham> we don't care
[15:09:23] <jotham> we've cut off contact with you guys
[15:09:31] <jotham> but don't keep bringing jacinda up
[15:09:35] <jotham> it's very dumb and sexist
[15:09:39] <jotham> you guys hate a female leader
[15:09:42] <jotham> we get it
[15:09:43] <jotham> and it's very bad
[15:09:46] <jotham> your cultural baggage
[15:09:48] <jotham> not ours
[15:10:05] <jotham> the pandemic has nailed this
[15:10:18] <jotham> foreign old white blokes are terrible at understanding female leaders
[15:10:20] <jessicara> "meanwhile in the uk"
[15:10:23] <jotham> and you can fuck off
[15:10:41] <jotham> but please do whatever you want
[15:10:46] <jotham> but your country is a fucking dumpster fire
[15:10:50] <jessicara> like a huge run of politicians breaking laws, social distancing rules, etc..
[15:11:00] <jotham> we have 75% compliance politically and 90% vaccine compliance
[15:11:05] <jotham> we're a cooperative society
[15:11:09] <Carbonflux> who keeps linking you all this stuff anyway?
[15:11:10] <jotham> that's all you can take away from this
[15:11:21] <jotham> and the pandemic would be over if everyone did this
[15:11:26] <jotham> so you guys are fucking the world up
[15:11:28] <Carbonflux> i never hear a bad word about your pm here
[15:11:29] <jotham> and it's very dumb
[15:11:37] <jotham> you guys are the worst people economically and socially
[15:12:05] <jotham> pandemic has made me way more racist than i ever was
[15:12:07] <jessicara> here in the uk, initially we heard sk and nz and such were doing well then our government preceeded to ignore what countries doing well were doing and did random things
[15:12:11] <jotham> mostly toward white shitty european people
[15:12:41] <Carbonflux> the pandemic is being made worse by isolations. 
[15:12:50] <jotham> financial times said the planet shutting down for 6 months and paying everyone would have wiped it out and cost lest than 0.2% of gdp
[15:12:58] <jotham> the current playout is an absolute nightmare
[15:13:02] <jessicara> yeah
[15:13:05] <jotham> so the right wing didn't even listen to the Liberals
[15:13:06] <jessicara> we got the worst option
[15:13:08] <jotham> it's a shitshow
[15:13:19] <jessicara> right wing never did listen to liberals?
[15:13:19] <jotham> i don't want to hear from cunts like Carbonflux that he should be free
[15:13:24] <jotham> when we have a raging disease
[15:13:36] <jotham> i mean Liberals not liberals
[15:13:41] <Carbonflux> its not a raging disease.
[15:13:42] <jotham> as in the whigs
[15:14:16] <Carbonflux> like i said, many more people die from starvation and no one gives a shit.
[15:14:17] <jotham> Carbonflux: i think you should look at what omicron is doing to the UK right now
[15:14:34] <jotham> the end game for all of us is it becomes super infectious but as weak as the common cold
[15:14:40] <jotham> but we're only 1/3 of teh way there
[15:14:42] <Carbonflux> the pandemic lockdowns are designed to address climate change.
[15:14:49] <jotham> haha
[15:14:51] <jotham> fuck off mate
[15:14:52] <jessicara> what
[15:15:00] <jotham> Carbonflux: no country thinks that's true
[15:15:11] <jotham> Carbonflux: a conspiracy that only affects americans is probably a lie
[15:15:15] <jotham> Carbonflux: you are part of the world
[15:15:22] <jotham> Carbonflux: you must know this
[15:15:31] <Carbonflux> the lockdowns have had a very positive effect on climate change.
[15:15:39] <jotham> not really
[15:15:41] <jotham> a bit 
[15:15:45] <jotham> but only in some sectors
[15:15:48] <jessicara> yeah a short pause
[15:15:56] <jotham> that's a complicated statement
[15:16:10] <jotham> that's saying that supply chains just magically earned profit during the pause
[15:16:12] <jotham> which they didn't
[15:16:18] <jotham> so they will over work to catch up
[15:16:29] <jessicara> more like all sorts of ups and downs through it
[15:17:00] <Carbonflux> ya but if we can keep it going, keeping having new variants, limit global trade even more we will make a real impact on climate change and maybe even meet some of the targets.
[15:17:02] <jotham> the pandemic lockdowns were to do one thing
[15:17:05] <jessicara> some will overwork, some are rather long term damaged
[15:17:05] <jotham> keep people elected
[15:17:25] <jessicara> at this rate we will keep having new variants
[15:17:28] <jotham> yeah it's a very fancy idea Carbonflux 
[15:17:34] <jotham> but it doesn't work outside of america
[15:17:39] <jessicara> sometimes i'm convinced the uk government wants this
[15:17:41] <jotham> it's just a statement you're an american
[15:17:47] <jessicara> but then again could just be really silly
[15:18:17] <jotham> i think sars will be with us forever and we need medical science to resolve it but in the process it might shake up global medicine
[15:18:20] <jessicara> like, delta is seen "lets see what happens" and continue with "the great reopening"
[15:18:23] <jotham> and america will shoot itself to death
[15:18:35] <jotham> they've shown modernism and cold war power is useless day to day
[15:18:41] <jotham> i think this is the death of america
[15:19:02] <Carbonflux> well, given the nature of MRNA vaccines combined with the use of anti-biotics in hospitals we will keep getting variants.
[15:19:12] <jotham> mate
[15:19:13] <jessicara> the nature of the vaccines?
[15:19:21] <jessicara> antibiotics don't affect viruses either
[15:19:24] <jessicara> that's bacteria
[15:19:34] <jotham> all your buddies think that producing things that communicate with the immune system is a form of nazi medical fascism
[15:19:40] <jotham> i think you guys are out of the tree
[15:19:58] <jessicara> from what i've seen the vaccines are incapable of producing new variants
[15:20:04] <jessicara> there is no live virus in them
[15:20:18] <jotham> people call a 30 year old monkey virus payload (az vaccine, sputnik vaccine) a 'novel vaccine'
[15:20:20] <jessicara> it's just the spike protein attached to something else pretty much, rather clever stuff
[15:20:26] <Carbonflux> ya MRNA vaccines don't last very long, the immune system does not store the pattern like it does with older style vaccines, this is the plan really, to create a subscription model. 
[15:20:26] <jotham> because they heard the word 'novel corona virus'
[15:20:31] <jotham> not because they know what novel means
[15:20:48] <jotham> so get the az vaccine Carbonflux 
[15:20:54] <jotham> that's why your argument is dumb
[15:21:11] <jotham> the az platform is 30 years old
[15:21:18] <jotham> and even the soviets are using it
[15:21:20] <jessicara> i should point out that the vaccines have helped with things like the measles..
[15:21:20] <Carbonflux> my argument is not dumb, its just ahead of its time, like always.
[15:21:21] <jotham> and they choose your president
[15:21:36] <jessicara> this has similar immune escape going on
[15:21:36] <jotham> don't take an mrna vaccine mate
[15:21:40] <Carbonflux> MRNA is too new is all
[15:21:41] <jotham> take a 30 year old monkey vacicne
[15:21:46] <jotham> that has been used for dozens of things
[15:21:52] <jotham> that you probably have already had
[15:21:57] <jotham> your argument is shit
[15:22:21] <Carbonflux> MRNA is perfect for big pharma, you have to keep taking it once every few months forever.
[15:22:24] <jotham> sputnik or pfizer
[15:22:33] <jotham> er sputnik or az
[15:22:37] <Carbonflux> its better than opioids.
[15:22:38] <jotham> just take the az vacine
[15:22:42] <jotham> it stops all the worries you have
[15:22:45] <jotham> and it's 30 years old
[15:22:51] <Carbonflux> we can't get that here 
[15:22:57] <jotham> yes you can
[15:23:01] <Carbonflux> only MRNA vac here
[15:23:03] <jotham> my friend in san diego just drove to LA
[15:23:07] <jotham> to get the az vaccine
[15:23:16] <jotham> she's pregnant
[15:23:19] <jotham> it was a big drama for her
[15:23:19] <Carbonflux> is he one of the ones sending you links?
[15:23:24] <jotham> he?
[15:23:25] <Carbonflux> she
[15:23:26] <jotham> pregnant mate
[15:23:42] <jotham> az is available where you live
[15:23:43] <Carbonflux> ya well, i was typing before you said that
[15:23:50] <jotham> but pfizer is better imo
[15:23:53] <jotham> based on the data
[15:23:58] <jotham> so you have plenty of coices
[15:24:00] <jessicara> it does seem good
[15:24:07] <jotham> and it's not just 'magical new mrna'
[15:24:12] <Carbonflux> on the short term data ya
[15:24:13] <jotham> tha'ts a very shit way to look at it
[15:24:18] <Carbonflux> but you have to keep taking it
[15:24:26] <jotham> sir
[15:24:27] <Carbonflux> anyway, wait a few years.
[15:24:33] <jotham> 12 months ago every single moron like you
[15:24:35] <jessicara> the vaccines seem roughly similar enough
[15:24:36] <jotham> was screaming
[15:24:43] <jotham> that rna vaccines have never worked
[15:24:46] <jessicara> in terms of immune response
[15:24:48] <jotham> because they mutate faster than dna
[15:24:54] <jotham> so it's not really the vaccines fault
[15:24:57] <Carbonflux> MRNA is like showing the immune system a photo of the virus
[15:25:06] <jotham> you already know that the change in rna is quicker than in dna
[15:25:07] <jessicara> as is any natural response
[15:25:10] <jotham> so don't be dishonest
[15:25:27] <jotham> people that call rna mrna are shit also
[15:25:28] <Carbonflux> its not in the right format for long term storage
[15:25:33] <jessicara> the natural response also may include clotting
[15:25:34] <jotham> it's an imaginary term
[15:25:36] <jotham> based on the media
[15:25:40] <jotham> it's just rna Carbonflux 
[15:25:43] <jotham> stop being a dick
[15:25:50] <Carbonflux> i am not being a dick
[15:25:54] <jotham> it's rna
[15:26:05] <jotham> messenger rna is a massive ignorance of how dna turns into rna
[15:26:07] <Carbonflux> i am seeing thru their addictive marketing scam
[15:26:14] <jotham> and it's a technical word for scientists not us
[15:26:17] <jotham> it's just rna vaccine
[15:26:36] <jotham> it's designed to make you dumber at science
[15:26:39] <Carbonflux> everyone is a scientist
[15:26:39] <jotham> call it rna or dna
[15:26:43] <jotham> nope
[15:26:48] <jotham> i'm a technician
[15:26:54] <jotham> and mrna is a dumb idea
[15:27:00] <jotham> unless you're a scientist
[15:27:20] <jotham> you've been pollinated by the media
[15:27:29] <jessicara> media science is garbage often
[15:27:37] <jotham> here is what happens Carbonflux 
[15:27:40] <jessicara> but yeah this sounds unusually hostile
[15:27:59] <jotham> the vaccine enters your cells with some rna rules and your protien folders start producing these chemicals
[15:28:08] <jotham> there is no 'mrna'
[15:28:08] <jessicara> the research paper: found a cool thing, lets look further.  media: cure for mortality found.
[15:28:15] <jotham> you're a fucking idiot if you think there is
[15:28:37] <jotham> mrna is this idea that when some of the rna is taking from the core of the cell and is then printed by the protein folders in your cell
[15:28:43] <jotham> which is the same as the inbound chemicals
[15:28:54] <jotham> the whole point is the dna is in a vault
[15:29:00] <jotham> that nothing can touch (viruses) 
[15:29:05] <jotham> and they take it out as a print in rna
[15:29:10] <jotham> then fold it in the machines
[15:29:23] <Carbonflux> mrna is just another word for scriptkiddy
[15:29:24] <jotham> and htat's all the fucking vaccine is doing too
[15:29:31] <jotham> this 'mrna' thing is a media hype dumb idea
[15:29:41] <jotham> and if you say it you misunderstand how your own cells work
[15:29:46] <Carbonflux> you are using semantics to evade the real issue.
[15:29:49] <jotham> it's rna
[15:29:54] <jotham> saying it means you're stupid
[15:30:05] <Carbonflux> there are no stupid people
[15:30:05] <jotham> definitely prove me wrong
[15:30:16] <jotham> i mean you're gonna kill a bunch of people
[15:30:19] <jotham> so either actively evil
[15:30:21] <jotham> or stupid
[15:30:26] <jotham> if you want me to choose actively stupid
[15:30:28] <jotham> okay
[15:30:30] <jotham> that's also fine
[15:30:35] <jotham> i've met some weird people on irc
[15:30:43] <Carbonflux> frame of reference.
[15:30:57] <jotham> explain the difference between rna and mrna
[15:31:01] <jotham> you're just using a media term
[15:31:30] <Carbonflux> well ya for convivence, i did not expect to be ambushed for it.
[15:31:34] <jotham> but you're sure you know why pfizer is bad
[15:31:39] <jotham> so you have to explain this to me
[15:31:42] <jotham> explain the difference between rna and mrna
[15:32:38] <jotham> pfizer is literally just sending rna signals into protein folding molecules
[15:32:43] <jotham> which the cells already do
[15:32:50] <Carbonflux> that question does not make sense
[15:32:51] <jotham> and all it does is produce terrible structures
[15:32:57] <jotham> that the nervous system throws under the bus
[15:32:57] <Carbonflux> mrna is rna
[15:33:06] <jotham> right why call it mrna then
[15:33:10] <jotham> that was my whole point
[15:33:17] <jotham> it's a media beatup
[15:33:19] <jotham> by retards
[15:33:20] <Carbonflux> because of its specific application
[15:33:24] <jotham> nope
[15:33:30] <jotham> it's a dumb media idea
[15:33:36] <jotham> what's the difference between mrna and rna
[15:33:42] <jotham> i think there is one useful answer
[15:33:46] <Carbonflux> you use dumb and stupid too much
[15:33:55] <jotham> you used mrna as a boogy man
[15:33:57] <jotham> like all morons
[15:33:59] <Carbonflux> arguing from authority is not good
[15:34:00] <jotham> for the last hour
[15:34:04] <jotham> i mean i can paste them
[15:34:09] <jotham> MRNA ISN'T NATURAL or some shit
[15:34:15] <jotham> but you don't even know what it means
[15:34:18] <jotham> what does mrna means
[15:34:26] <jotham> and how does it work in the cell
[15:34:57] <Carbonflux> i can't talk to you when you're drunk, you keep putting words into my mouth that i don't mean. I am going to bed :)
