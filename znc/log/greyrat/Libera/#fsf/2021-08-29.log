[01:31:37] <kreyren[m]> Why do we do such as shitty job at educating people at FLOSS?
[01:32:12] <kreyren[m]> i just had a long convo with a person who hates FLOSS and calls it communism only for them to realize that FLOSS is not what he was told and that it supports his ideas such as him not having to use Facebook when using his VR headset

[01:41:42] <Anedroid> But I see people often dislike free software, and I have no idea why
[01:43:38] <Anedroid> I don't understand why users defend companies that harm them by restricting their freedom.
[01:50:26] <kreyren[m]> hmm from my experience schools teach them that
[01:50:41] <kreyren[m]> bcs some companies such as M$ pay for lessons that shit on FLOSS
[01:53:33] <Anedroid> So... it's like a jail, but in their mind
[01:53:46] <Noisytoot> what's wrong with communism?
[01:53:57] <joepublic> the state of video and wifi drivers in the free world does not help free software's image.  Even though it's the hardware manufacturers who make devices requiring proprietary blobs to even function, the impression is "free software doesn't support video or wifi widely or well"
[01:54:30] <fructose> Anedroid: Some people are vulnerable to thinking that the more something costs, the better it is. This is studied in psychology if you want to look into it more
[01:55:53] <fructose> Noisytoot: It's never worked, for one
[01:56:06] <Noisytoot> but free software does work
[01:56:17] <Noisytoot> if free software is communism and it works, there's nothing wrong with it
[01:56:24] <Noisytoot> (although it isn't communism)
[01:59:26] <alyx> there's commonly a really strong push towards the ethical values of free software vs the material values of it imo
[02:00:02] <alyx> ethics are good but, sadly, a lot of folks don't care about ethics or about some magical "all source is free and we can all frolic happily in our source code daisies" world
[02:00:13] <alyx> they care more about "oh cool so i could make my VR not need facebook"
[02:00:54] <joepublic> "I could make my cell phone not spy on me looking always for child pornography"
[02:01:11] <fructose> alyx: Making your VR not need Facebook sounds ethical to me
[02:01:27] <alyx> fructose: oh it's definitely ethical too :P but it's also practical
[02:02:20] <alyx> the same thing can be said for a _lot_ of things people might want that they can't get in closed source platforms; there's normally an ethics connection to it because what they're not able to get is the decision of some large proprietary platform -- probably a bad one
[02:02:25] <fructose> That sounds like you're implying ethics aren't practical
[02:02:49] <joepublic> "I can make my satellite tv receiver stop caring about whether I have a subscription"
[02:02:49] <fructose> And if your ethics aren't practical, I have bad news
[02:02:49] <alyx> to the people who would call free software communism, they're not

[02:12:13] <Anedroid> Do you know any free translator with polish support, and with possibility to work offline?
[02:12:47] <Anedroid> (alternative for Google Translate)
[02:15:19] <Anedroid> It would be great if our free software community created an Android app which can work offline with Google Translate packages
[02:15:48] <Anedroid> But I don't know if Google use open file format for this

[17:26:39] <xx> BSD or MIT probably require the others to retain some copyright notice about authorship, etc.
[17:26:55] <yrk> la_mettrie: instead, a license such as the modified bsd permits that you distribute the work under different terms
[17:27:12] <yrk> la_mettrie: but the license remains. _only_ the copyright holder may change the license
[17:27:14] <xx> looks like unlicense is the common way to do it, if I understand it right. I'll still need to run it through the company lawyer anyway.

[17:28:02] <yrk> la_mettrie: this is exactly the different between relicensing and compatibility. a subtle but crutial difference that is the root of a lot of confusion
[17:28:32] <yrk> http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatIsCompatible
[17:30:02] <yrk> just because 3-bsd is _compatible_ with the gpl, and you distribute a work _as a whole_ under the gpl with 3-bsd parts, it absolutely does not mean that the 3-bsd parts get relicensed. when they get to the other end of the distribution, they are still under 3-bsd and it would be a copyright violation to change them
[17:30:13] *** Joins: schumaml (~schumaml@p57b7ed95.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[17:30:54] <yrk> you can't take bsd-licensed code and rip off the bsd headers and replace them with gpl. but when you distribute those 3bsd parts as part of a gpl'd piece of software, the _distribution of the whole_ is done under the terms of gpl
[17:31:12] <xx> yrk: thanks, that is exactly the source of a lot of confusion here
[17:31:23] <yrk> unfortunately, the same is true when you distribute a 3bsd-style license as part of a proprietary bit of software

[22:20:50] <banshi> is it possible to restrict using of free software by NSA ?
[22:21:42] <joepublic> restricting software by field of endeavor makes it non-free, by not granting freedom 0.

[22:24:04] <kompowiec> I would like to say does exist license that allows it, but it doesn't seem right;)
[22:24:32] <yrk> banshi: https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/20050211.html
[22:25:40] <yrk> banshi: essentially, if you allow stuff like that you end software freedom. each license will have a laundry-list of activities, political parties, countries, and religions that prohibit you from using the software
[22:26:57] <yrk> banshi: "this is under the GPL... except that you have to be vegan, tall, athiest, and republican to use it. also this cannot be used in power stations, lavatories, to experiment on animals, if you believe in evolution...". you get the idea
