[01:27:01] <SysGhost> Alison40: IO have a similar one in a work laptop.  haven't had any problems booting it. I'd guess yours need a BIOS/Firmware update. Also try adding nomodeset to the kernel comamnd line on the boot menu.

[01:29:39] <Namarrgon> Amnesia: that affects only dm
[01:30:10] <topcat001> I believe fstrim.service is preferable.
[01:30:19] <Amnesia> isn't `dm` the only relevant part here, since using luks implies dm ?
[01:30:26] <SysGhost> Alison40: The boot menu from the arch live media has a key shortcut to allow you to edit the arhc boot options. It'll open a rudimentary editor where you can change what is called the "kernel command line"
[01:30:51] <Namarrgon> Amnesia: yes but if the filesystem doesn't send any discard commands then dm won't discard anything either
[01:31:07] <Amnesia> or is that rd.luks.options=discard there to make lvm propagate trim operations to the actual hardware, over dm ?

[01:43:23] <Alison40> so I'm going to arch which is the complete opposite
[01:43:23] <Alison40> unstable but customisable and logical
[01:44:01] <topcat001> NTFS is slower that ext4 (sometimes dramatically) for some operations, but overall it's quite robust (though I think not more than ext4).
[01:44:09] <SysGhost> Arch isn't the best "first time using linux" choice. But.. .if one is up for a challenge.
[01:44:21] <evilop> topcat001: not really robust, specially not with ntfs-3f
[01:44:24] <evilop> g
[01:44:36] <topcat001> No I mean on windows
[01:45:01] <evilop> not really on windows either, I've had a lot of ntfs corruptions
[01:45:02] <Alison40> I'd rather not have to distrohop to arch from a more beginner friendly one
[01:45:04] <SysGhost> Arch is the "I know Linux well, and I want it *my way* without cruft and bloat" - kind of distribution

[01:46:30] <SysGhost> Alison40: I use it whenever I have to use it from a Windows install.
[01:46:46] <SysGhost> Otherwise I prefer the simple "dd" command 
[01:46:57] <jkc> evilop: In contrast to your experience, I have never experienced a single instance of ntfs corruption.

[01:48:40] <SysGhost> Alison40: Most windows USB boot creators don't do linux ISO's well or entirely correct. They often fail by reusing old partitions on the USB media.
[01:48:42] <topcat001> lfs/slackware/gentoo not for me if I want to get actual work done lol
[01:49:19] <jkc> Alison40: On Windows, use rufus, ONLY in DD mode. Not ISO mode. Never ISO mode.
[01:49:34] <SysGhost> Alison40: they then boot up the kernel, but fail detect the USB media to get into the later boot stage

[01:58:19] <Alison40> yeah
[01:58:29] <Alison40> linux has so many compatibility features

[04:49:50] <lostchild> This question is addressed more to advanced arch users, since I have no clue how to work around one issue. Tried finding answers all across different forums and was googling appropriate guides but non of them work as needed. I am not a networking expert, only basic knowledge.

[04:49:55] <lostchild> Issue: I have 3 Mobile Broadband Modems (Huawei 353), connected to the host machine via USB. I need to assign every modem to a different user on the same host, so that every user could have a completely separated internet connection. When modems are in idle state(connected to host, but not in use), I tried connecting one modem per user at a time. Hence, logged in into the user1 -> connected modem1 -> logged out. Logged in 
[04:49:57] <lostchild> into the user2 -> connected modem2 -> logged out. And what I found out here, when logged in into user2 and the modem2 was chosen, this modem2 was also automatically assigned to user1. Hence, the kernel simply connects all users to only one modem chosen.
[04:49:59] <lostchild> _
[04:50:01] <lostchild> I went a step further, and decided to set up different Network Namespaces. I created 3 groups, for every group I created 2 virtual interfaces(veth1, veth2, veth3, veth4, veth5, veth6) for each group, moved modems1-3(enp0s20f0u1, enp0s20f0u2, enp0s20f0u3) to corresponding groups(1-3) along with created interfaces(1 per group) the rest 3 interfaces were left in the main Network Namespace.

[06:21:53] <mpan> horseface: you may also use `badblocks` (of core/e2fsprogs) to test (WARNING: MAY WIPE DATA) the entire storage for unreliable blocks. It is likely it will detect zero errors, but may trigger reallocations on the device itself. It has read-only test, which is non-destructive, read-write (may be somewhat destructive in bad case) and write-test (destructive). Of course the last one is the full one.

[07:07:04] <reillybrogan> I'm not actually using Arch linux, but am debugging an issue on a different distro with OpenGL not working with the new driver. It seems the issue is related to the lack of our package creating a nvidia-drm_gbm.so symlink so I'm checking to see if the Arch package is providing this file and where it's going (our installation method is very different than what Arch uses, so I'm wondering if this file is created later in the 
[07:07:04] <reillybrogan> nvidia-provided build script)
[07:07:33] <reillybrogan> Was more hoping for a quick answer from someone using the 495 driver than spinning up an Arch VM to check
[07:07:48] <thurstylark> ?pkgfile nvidia-drm_gbm.so
[07:07:49] <EMIYA> thurstylark: no results for 'nvidia-drm_gbm.so'
[07:09:06] <reillybrogan> It's actually only in the AUR currently I think which doesn't list the files in a package

[20:01:58] <preston> o/ hey everyone
[20:02:43] <preston> wiping my hard drive due to the npm supply chain attack from yesterday, wanted to run dd against it before reinstalling
[20:03:02] <preston> reading the arch wiki, was curious if i should do the entire block
[20:03:05] <preston> Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 953.87 GiB, 1024209543168 bytes, 2000409264 sectors
[20:03:16] <preston> all 1024209543168 bytes?
[20:03:17] <Alison40> if i boot with default settings it freezes after "no caching page found" and "assuming drive cache: write through"
[20:03:17] <Alison40> if i boot with acpi=off it still takes a while but it instead freezes at the journalctl startup
[20:03:23] <grawity> preston: what's the goal
[20:03:46] <preston> grawity: just securely wiping everything off it and reinstalling arch
[20:03:47] <grawity> preston: with SSDs generally don't bother, run `blkdiscard` to tell the controller to throw the whole thing away
[20:04:01] <preston> oh? really?
[20:04:08] <preston> neat
[20:04:21] <grawity> tbh mkfs.ext4 will discard the entire partition before initializing the filesystem anyway

[20:06:39] <grawity> if you were giving away the physical disk, erasing it makes sense and in that case there's the NVMe equivalent of "ATA secure erase" (which has more specific guarantees than TRIM/blkdiscard does)

[23:16:41] <th0rne> amdgpu.dc=0 This tells the kernel not to use amdgpu. It will fall back to radeon instead.
[23:16:55] <th0rne> Is that true? Is that what I want?

[23:17:47] <th0rne> That's from some reddit post, so I guess there's like 50% chance it's true.
