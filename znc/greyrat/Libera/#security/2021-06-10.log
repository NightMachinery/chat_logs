[02:04:26] <velix> seachdamh: Yeah, but I want to pipe log files to another computer without seeing them.
[02:04:37] <velix> So gpg and age seem useable.
[02:05:01] <seachdamh> yes, it is usable. I agree.
[02:05:25] <velix> It's not about high security, but using an asymmetric key, I can make the supervisor read the logs only.
[02:06:34] <seachdamh> and age don't store private keys in safe way so now pgp mayby is better option still.
[02:07:14] <velix> seachdamh: supervisor should give me the public key only. So I don't care ;)

[02:08:16] <seachdamh> in that way - I would choose age. smaller, lighter and do same work with safe algorithms.

[02:11:34] <piou> I mean, journald's binary files are already rather prone to corruption, not sure I'd want to add encryption by default on that, but as an option it would be nice
[02:12:01] <seachdamh> but why not use whole disc encryption in that case?
[02:12:12] <velix> seachdamh: Because then I know the private key.
[02:12:32] <velix> piou: All major distributions use journld for logging. Do you really think, e.g. Debian would have chosen journld if it's such a risk?
[02:12:51] <velix> Starting from Bullseye, logfiles in systemd get permanently stored on filesystem.
[02:13:04] <piou> velix: it happened to me less than 2 months ago. It was the first time. But I'm not talking about an hypothetical and absolutely impractical risk
[02:13:07] <abraxas> "prone to corruption" I think is a little hyperbolic

[02:13:44] <velix> /dev/log is also
[02:14:00] <piou> velix: I know that most distros use systemd as a whole and journald specifically, I even like that overall, but let's not get carried away in some "do you really think" baseless argument please.
[02:14:02] <velix> The question is: Does systemd provide tools to handle the corruption?
[02:14:18] <piou> That is a better question, and tbf I don't know
[02:14:40] <velix> piou: "do you really think" is the reason I'm using Debian. Because other, more experienced users do the decision for me :-)
[02:14:56] <velix> And they seem have decided: it's fine.
[02:15:13] <velix> The debian community is damn critical about this stuff ... or even the redhat guys.
[02:15:21] <velix> Redhat really is into systemd and journld.

[02:21:25] <velix> flyback: in terms of data-recovery? No. We're just discussing the risk of broken journald log files.
[02:21:30] <flyback> ah ok :)
[02:21:45] <velix> "Things are different for corruptions in the middle. We have no nice tool for salvaging data from such corruption, but they could be written relatively easily.

[02:22:51] <flyback> "oh btw our gui has no way to tell you the status of your btrfs raid array"

[08:03:07] <moose> You on the other hand? You're not introducing yourself to me or anyone else here in a nice way. Please try to be a better person.
[08:05:35] <beelzebuzz> i'm not the one that repeatedly got kicked or muted or banned from freenode's security channel
[08:05:50] <moose> This isn't Freenode.
[08:06:08] <beelzebuzz> isnt my point. he's already doing the same old thing

[08:09:24] <electr0n> its a memory issue, ill give ya 3 gueses but you'll need only 1
[08:09:51] <flyback> that reminds me thx
[08:10:06] <flyback> I have to setup windbg to figure out why I couldn't convert a customer's old win10 install into a vm
[08:10:15] <flyback> that's a trick I been  using lately it works great
[08:10:21] <flyback> you throw the old damaged install into a vm
[08:10:41] <flyback> then you can immediately start reloading the physical machine fresh while being able to reference the old install to extract passwords etc

[08:11:37] <flyback> did you guys know usb 2.0 and usb 3.0 have these modes where they emulate auart
[08:11:51] <flyback> you can use for debug interface, ems, or juts a kernel console port
[08:12:16] <flyback> doesn't need a usb driver or usb stack, just a memory write
[08:12:50] <flyback> making the cable work for usb 2.0 is rare and a pain but the 3.0 ones are easy
[08:13:16] <electr0n> moose: it is
[08:15:27] <flyback> im going to try to make one of the usb 2.0 ones so my nas can have a serial console without needing to waste a pci-e slot for a rs232 port
[08:17:55] <moose> electr0n: Haha I was thinking it might've been C++ though. But C is always the strong choice :D

[21:38:02] <Lindisfarne> yes it's an honor system
[21:38:24] <Lindisfarne> if you extort someone for ransom and don't unlock the data after they pay you, you fuck up the ransomware ecosystem
[21:38:42] <Lindisfarne> and the other ransomware ppl will be on you
[21:40:18] <mats1> assuming attribution is available, sure
[21:40:38] <Lindisfarne> now you know why Darkside ran affiliate programs
[21:41:12] <mats1> they did that because retail risk is a business problem

[21:44:07] <Lindisfarne> more pointedly, they wanted to control how independent extortionists used their code, so they didn't ruin the franchise.

[21:59:11] <mats1> no doubt reputational risk is a real problem, but lets not draw causal lines where they dun belong
[22:02:04] <Lindisfarne> it's pretty obvious that if nobody got their data back, nobody would pay the ransom
[22:02:24] <Lindisfarne> this is normal analysis, not bald-head mis-statements

[22:16:25] <chester> Is it because it takes far less work to profit a lot with for(all_files as file) { encrypt(file,key); } send_key_to_idiot; show_extortion_dialog_box();?
[22:17:00] <Lindisfarne> there's also money in disruption itself
