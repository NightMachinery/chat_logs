[03:40:40] <jkk> hello
[03:41:06] <jkk> is  it possible to make a tor like browser that will spoof all data send to server via browser - all sys data
[03:41:15] <jkk> anon tor browser with js
[04:27:06] <xx> jkk: bad idea
[04:27:08] <xx> just use tails
[04:27:31] <jkk> xx idea is great
[04:27:33] <jkk> :)
[04:27:38] <jkk> as it will include all js users
[04:27:44] <xx> no it is not, it makes you stand out massively
[04:27:58] <jkk> once more millions willl use it
[04:28:14] <jkk> tor with anon js browsing
[04:28:21] <jkk> it will be nr 1 browser
[04:28:27] <xx> yeah, no
[04:28:34] <xx> what you're looking for is tails
[04:29:08] <xx> even right now the regular tor browser reveals whether the user is on windows or linux
[04:29:12] <jkk> which hardware data tails report to js requests?
[04:29:48] <xx> what hardware data do you imagine browsers normally send?
[04:31:54] <jkk> gpu responce
[04:32:02] <jkk> screen size
[04:32:28] <jkk> audio fingerprint
[04:32:36] <jkk> there are more
[04:33:12] <xx> all of those get put into various buckets and reported
[04:33:49] <jkk> get put by?
[04:34:14] <xx> tor browser
[04:34:37] <jkk> emmm
[04:34:53] <jkk> are we saying tor browser with JS on reports fake hardware data?
[04:35:06] <jkk> i did not knew it could do that
[04:35:23] <xx> again, what hardware data do you mean? The ones you listed are made less accurate and put into bins.
[04:35:32] <jkk> https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/
[04:35:40] <jkk> less accurate?
[04:35:45] <jkk> is there a link to read more?
[04:35:52] <xx> yes, the link you just posted
[04:35:52] <jkk> what does less accurate even means?
[04:36:47] <jkk>  JavaScript features such as Resource Timing may leak an unknown amount of network timing related information
[04:37:11] <xx> e.g. if something would take exactly 1234.5ms on regular browser, torbrowser will report any duration between 1000ms and 2000ms as 1500ms
[04:37:36] <jkk> hmmm
[04:37:46] <jkk> it says may leak an ukniwn amount
[04:37:54] <jkk> where does it say it prevents it?
[04:37:56] <xx> you sound like you want to learn more about tor
[04:38:04] <xx> so go read *every single link* on the design document
[04:38:22] <jkk> tor with JS atm is not anon
[04:38:55] <xx> tor never claimed to be anonymous
[04:39:16] <xx> the only thing tor ever claimed in any main document is that it hides your location, nothing more
[04:39:37] <xx> i.e. the adversary can still find out who you are, but it is made harder for them to find out where you are
[04:39:57] <jkk> Medium
[04:39:59] <jkk> At this security level, we disable the ION JIT (javascript.options.ion), native regular expressions (javascript.options.native_regexp), Baseline JIT (javascript.options.baselinejit), WebAudio (media.webaudio.enabled), MathML (mathml.disabled), SVG Opentype font rendering (gfx.font_rendering.opentype_svg.enabled),
[04:40:15] <jkk> this is just a lot of talk
[04:40:16] <jkk> :P
[04:40:19] <jkk> about nothing
[04:40:31] <jkk> it is anon as per its anon specs
[04:40:31] <xx> you wouldn't call it nothing if you studied up on it
[04:40:45] <jkk>  tor never claimed to be anonymous Xd
[04:41:06] <jkk> with security set to safest people join tor browsers user anon pool, blend it
[04:41:08] <jkk> in
[04:41:28] <jkk> with setting on highers - such will be fingerprinted
[04:41:43] <jkk> tails does nothing about it
[04:41:51] <jkk> its simply a live in ram only distro
[04:42:36] <jkk> idea is to extend tor browser users anon pool by somehow spoofing all and any data about the system that can be requested via js
[04:42:37] <jkk> :)
[04:43:11] <xx> I just hope you're not using tor for anything that could endanger your life, because you most definitely are not using it in a safe manner
[04:43:28] <xx> you seem to have some ideas that you just double click and executable and you're protected
[04:44:13] <jkk> idea is to extend tor browser users anon pool by somehow spoofing all and any data about the system that can be requested via js Xd

[21:38:51] <verver> I have very low download speed during december. what is going wrong?
[21:41:17] <xx> verver: you might be connected to a slow guard node
[21:43:44] <verver> how to fix?
[21:47:01] <xx> if you're using tor browser, then download it again and extract it to a different directory and start it again
[21:47:08] <xx> it will pick a new guard node that might be faster
[21:47:16] <verver> i do not use tor browser
[21:47:33] <xx> in that case you need to erase whatever caches are generated by tor
[21:47:40] <xx> that's where it stores the guard node
[21:48:22] <verver> where is caches tor store exactly?
[21:48:48] <xx> is it system tor or user tor?
[21:48:51] <xx> what platform?
[21:49:04] <verver> system, linux
[21:49:30] <xx> /var/lib/tor
[21:58:07] <verver> I clean cashes. speed still low yet.
[22:03:27] <iv4nshm4k0v> verver: Are you in Russia, or connected through the Russian networks, perchance?  See, e. g., http://blog.torproject.org/tor-censorship-in-russia/ .
[22:04:43] <verver> iv4nshm4k0v: dirrect connection from Russia
[22:05:52] <iv4nshm4k0v> There's an ongoing effort to block IPv4 addresses of all the Tor nodes on all the Russian ISPs, but some ISPs are slow enough to adjust their blocklists so some Tor traffic still leaks through.  At lower bandwidth, though.
[22:07:51] <verver> tor become unusable and it's time to shutdown him?
[22:12:31] <iv4nshm4k0v> Frankly, at this point, I'd rather see the gov't
[22:12:31] <iv4nshm4k0v> ... Anyways, Russian network operators use the public list of Tor nodes to block their respective IPs.  There're so called 'Tor bridges' which are nodes whose IPs are /not/ public.  One (or more) of them can be used as the entry node to the network.  See, e. g, http://forum.torproject.net/t/tor-blocked-in-russia-how-to-circumvent-censorship/982 .
[22:17:52] <iv4nshm4k0v> Another option is if you have a (virtual) server or proxy or VPN located outside of Russia, through which the Tor traffic can be routed.  Like, say: $ ssh -n -N -f -L 4080:ip6-localhost:8080 -- myserver.example.net ; then adding HTTPSProxy [::1]:4080 to torrc(5).
[22:18:09] <verver> what is snowflake?
[22:20:45] <xx> or just use a bridge
[22:24:06] <verver> xx: there is condition: user must have gmail or riseup account. i have not.
[22:24:17] <verver> give me another solution.
[22:25:59] <xx> you don't need to have that
[22:26:19] <xx> ideally you wouldn't use any of those "public" bridges anyway
[22:26:32] <xx> you'd just have someone setup a bridge for you outside of russia, or set it up yourself
[22:27:28] <verver> xx: ok! set up a bridge for me.

[22:45:55] <iv4nshm4k0v> I think a better idea long-term would be to convince every single freedom-friendly organization to make a Tor node reachable via the same IPv4 address their primary website runs on.
[23:06:13] <xx> that's not gonna happen
