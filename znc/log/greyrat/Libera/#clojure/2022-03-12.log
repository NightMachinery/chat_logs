[03:26:48] <z3t0_alt> hi all how are you?
[03:26:54] <z3t0_alt> I am trying to learn how this code works,  #(wrap-cors % request :access-control-allow-origin (get-cors-origin)
[03:26:55] <z3t0_alt>                          :access-control-allow-methods [:get :put :post :delete])
[03:27:06] <z3t0_alt> specifically what has me confused is the # and %
[03:27:20] <z3t0_alt> how can i go about rewriting this piece in the form of (fn [arg] body)
[03:27:50] <z3t0_alt> From what I understand is that the "#" is used to declare an anonymous function, and "%" means arguments but I don't really get it..
[03:35:39] *** Quits: boogiepop (~boogiepop@S01066c55e885c6e1.cg.shawcable.net) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[03:35:47] <seebs> i think that's just syntactic sugar for a function declaration, with % representing the first argument?
[03:36:09] <z3t0_alt> Ah gotcha
[03:36:18] <z3t0_alt> So if there were two arguments then "%" would not work?
[03:36:22] <seebs> so like #(wrap-cors %) is equivalent to (fn [x] (wrap-cors x))
[03:36:27] <seebs> then you'd use %1 and %2 etc
[03:36:39] <seebs> also be aware that i'm a newbie and might be completely wrong
[03:37:47] <z3t0_alt> ah i see, and thank you haha im also a newbie ::D

[18:36:58] <sobel> i think i was already doing 70% or better of that stuff but it doesn't hurt to see it all bundled up into one justification

[18:39:19] <Para> You know what, I think I'm strongly biased. One of my last job interview questions were what I value in a good API and my top three points from that list were 3(+6), 1 and 2.
[18:39:35] <Para> And some other things as well about strong conformance of the payloads, but still.
[18:41:01] <Para> I've been toying with an idea of all services being sort of neighbour aware with thresholds. That is, if service A knows it needs B and C, and through in-memory measurement it figures min/avg/max for how often each is called, some multiple of avg and going over previous max should send alerts on behalf of the other services.
[18:41:34] <sobel> i'm not sure about the "expand" feature, all my api requests happen in parallel
[18:41:57] <Para> I'm fairly certain the expansion is from a book even I have somewhere.
[18:42:05] <Para> It's basically a way to avoid having subresources.
[18:42:41] <sobel> if i gotta have an endpoint for the subresource anyway i'm not likely to implement the expansion
[18:42:43] <Para> Which has of course the added benefit that since it'll be a single endpoint, transaction guarding means the full document will be consistent.
[18:43:07] <Para> I've rarely had the need for subresources, usually I end up refactoring them to top-level anyways :)
[18:44:02] <sobel> i'm just imagining moving a bunch of promise.all() from client to server code
[18:44:47] <sobel> i'm at a loss to thumbnail which is more advantageous from a UX angle
[18:44:55] <Para> Might be worth it, network latency sucks for complex resources.
[18:45:01] <sobel> probably server-everything is faster these days
[18:49:05] <Para> In fact the worst API I've built was HATEOAS.
[18:49:25] <Para> Years and years ago. And it wasn't entirely my fault but still, my responsibility so can't claim otherwise.
[18:49:48] <Para> ("Build a document store on top of distributed K/V database")
[18:56:16] <sobel> so, a JSON column on a table in a replicated postgresql instance?
[18:56:52] <sobel> or maybe a pre-document column EAV
[19:02:46] <Para> Yeah.
[19:03:14] <Para> This was around postgres 9 being fresh out as well, so you can imagine how much we pointed our fingers at it as better solution.

[19:04:15] <Para> But alas, what was needed was time. I'm happy to learn afterwards that it was indeed replaced with postgres that took API call times to fractions and all that fun stuff.
[19:08:17] <sobel> in 2017 i took this job hoping to provide some of that magic
[19:08:26] <sobel> turns out, they did not have escape velocity to leave mysql
[19:08:54] <Para> I was promised the gravitational pull of Pepsi, instead I got the red dwarf of legacy.
[19:09:12] <sobel> this year i'm sounding the alarm: replace or die. no really, we're out of room. painted into a corner.
[19:10:04] <sobel> it's so bad. i altered 40 columns from double to int to make page space for 22 more columns

[19:12:21] <Para> That's like...daily run taking more than 24 hours to finish bad.
[19:12:43] <sobel> not every dang last variable needs to be mapped to its own column. in fact, our WHOLE value-add is figuring out the appropriate mapping into the few columns we store

[19:16:00] <sobel> this is the time of year i always get gung-ho to put a http analyzer in the chain and make some automation flesh out the real parameters of this API...then i remember that it makes no sense to fix this broken API and still be stuck with a broken frontend

[19:16:19] <sobel> o/ as we dance the legacy code tango o/
[19:16:22] <Para> This is going off tangent but a semi-friend/colleague of mine used to work early in the 00s for a company whose CMS (remember that era? Everyone had their own CMS) was entirely based on xslt.
[19:16:35] <Para> Like all actions a CMS normally does, but on the backend it's xslt.
[19:16:44] <sobel> my 1st startup failed to build a xslt based application suite
[19:17:02] <goodger> I have my own CMS ;_;
[19:17:05] <Para> I want to use OpenTelemetry for my next project, whatever it is.
[19:17:14] <sobel> we got as far as reusable components that could use session data to hit the database for user data
[19:17:23] <Para> it being the project of unknown nature, I mean
[19:17:28] <sobel> some sweeeeeet 30-second renders, definitely going to market with that
[19:21:27] <sobel> i forget what ORM we were using, but it was early JBoss days, and that stack was so amazingly slow
[19:21:43] <Para> IBM's JPA implementation, probably
[19:21:59] <Para> Whatever it was called. I've touched it for like three hours.
[19:22:37] <sobel> almost certainly. we were very standards oriented and jdk1.4 was so bad that we went to production with IBM's beta jdk because it was more stable
[19:23:23] <Para> Used to work on a product where company higher-ups had cobbled together a deal that if we get the product to run on IBM's stuff, they'll put it into their catalog. Two weeks of active dev time was reserved from both sides before they even asked us devs about it, but in any case, off to IBM's office we went with out source code, got the app server, had a few NPEs and other simple bugs, three hours
[19:23:25] <Para> later it ran perfectly (albeit slow as molasses).
[19:23:58] <Para> IBM guy was kinda perplexed how we could have built our software so well it didn't take more than that, but at least we got a free lunch out of that. It was chicken kyiv, funnily enough.
[19:24:00] <sobel> after that i reformed the company under new management and lighter dev staffing (3 of us splintered) to eventually succeed in that market with JSP+mysql
[19:24:30] <Para> Even Microsoft's not-jvm-jvm was faster back then.
[19:24:35] <ridcully_> i moved my bookmark.html over to xslt this week.  turns out you can no longer have a .xslt file right beside some .xml to get the job done for a browser...
[19:24:48] <Para> JVisual++ or some trash? It had one of those MS marketing names...
[19:25:07] <sobel> Visual J++
[19:25:57] <sobel> ugh, still not over MS being trash
[19:26:09] <sobel> i mean, tbf, neither are MS
[19:28:28] <goodger> my perception of MS now is that it's a server rental business that happens to own the IP for a severely obsolete consumer OS
[19:28:31] <Para> It's curious how MS has obvious high points and problem points with obvious solutions and continuations yet they never do take those.
[19:28:39] <goodger> at least, that's how they behave
[19:29:05] <Para> Like Windows design team uses Macs and don't actually use Windows as their daily driver. It's mostly just prototypes and simulations, wireframes and all that.
[19:30:01] <Para> Or that if Azure had PaaS for stuff like "run this piece of code for me" "OK" instead of "Sure, just enter your credit cards and choose an App Service Plan from these six tiers, oh and here's seven wizards for on-boarding since you haven't opened Azure Portal before on this account..."
[19:30:05] <sobel> their stewardship of the windows (win32?) api has been criminal
[19:30:23] <sobel> they are the poster-child for how not to manage shared dependencies
[19:30:36] <sobel> which is what they are. a big shared dep we can't manage reasonably.
[19:30:53] <Para> Windows loading overriding DLLs just because they exist in the same folder as the .exe sure was a design choice as well.
[19:31:28] <Para> I think that's mostly removed now, but haven't kept myself up to date on it. Like...why would anyone actually want that.
[19:32:24] <sobel> i need to upgrade a couple servers from 2016 Server to Win11. They are my legacy crap, and they totally have DLLs in the EXE folder.
[19:32:37] <sobel> so probably. they've supported that pattern since win95.
[19:32:42] <Para> I mean I guess they're signed now so there's that.
[19:33:03] <Para> Which really doesn't help as root signing certs are leaked/stolen from device manufacturers all the time. Latest that I know of being NVIDIA.
[19:33:16] <sobel> if anyone knows they're locked in, it's windows and their bigger ISVs like Adobe
[19:33:25] <Para> Is it a driver for your cryptomining rig, backdoor or both? Never find out, until your wallet is empty!
[19:34:02] <Para> I wish there was still a pay-once Photoshop.
[19:34:27] <sobel> oh yeah, that is some brilliant planning. i might ruin my voice screaming OCSP
[19:34:54] <sobel> why can't you bastages revoke a cert? too cheap to protect us for real?
[19:35:43] <sobel> that's one of my oldest axes to grind - signing key compromise has always been fully contemplated by architects and designers
[19:35:46] <Para> Yeah, people can update the drivers to new ones with proper certs.
[19:36:12] <Para> Sure someone can't but that gets to dubious territory quite quickly.
[19:36:50] <Para> Like sure, some specific version of CUDA requires a specific mix of versions etc. and that breaks, but that sounds like mission critical which sounds like you shouldn't be poking at it in any way to begin with.
[19:37:07] <Para> And we're already way beyond stupidity anyway, ref. twitter client for UEFI.
[19:37:31] <sobel> saw that. what will they do next, boot linux on it? :)
[19:37:50] <sobel> i suppose Doom is logically next
[19:38:16] <Para> since 27 December 2019 https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_UEFI
[19:38:21] <sobel> ahahaha
[19:38:35] <sobel> right, right, by the time i've thought of it it's already a thing
[19:38:54] <Para> Of course made by a Russian. They have a nack for that sort of stuff.
[19:39:01] <Para> And hats off for that.
[19:39:12] <sobel> well... i was just internally noting how tetris is no longer the go-to for such things
[19:39:18] <sobel> but here we are
[19:39:44] <Para> I was about to say Doom has better music but hmm, Tetris ain't bad either.
[19:40:09] <sobel> i will always be a proper fan of Russian people/culture for their can-do approach to science and engineering. i'm won over :)
[19:40:12] <ToxicFrog> > Windows loading overriding DLLs just because they exist in the same folder as the .exe sure was a design choice as well.
[19:40:14] <ToxicFrog> I think this is a more general side effect of how path search and library loading works in windows more generally:
[19:40:16] <ToxicFrog> - PATH does double duty as executable search path and dynamic library search path (i.e. what LD_LIBRARY_PATH is on linux)
[19:40:18] <ToxicFrog> - PATH starts with . (either implicitly or by default, I forget which)
[19:40:20] <ToxicFrog> - PWD when you launch an executable from the graphical shell is that program's working directory
[19:40:22] <ToxicFrog> -> DLLs get loaded from next to the EXE first, and only if that fails does it search the system DLL directories
[19:40:32] <ToxicFrog> *is that program's installed directory, rather
[19:40:58] <sobel> ToxicFrog: i think maybe the design choice was to double up the search path for exes to also find DLLs
[19:41:16] <ToxicFrog> And honestly, given that windows doesn't have a useful package manager, this is not a terrible idea -- if you have any parts of your program that are dynamically linked you have to ship them with the program, you can't just include a "depends on libfoo.dll" in the package metadata
[19:42:15] <ToxicFrog> And being able to drop them in the same directory as the program is a lot nicer than the bad old win9x days of "you have three programs that all need libfoo.dll and want to put it in C:/windows/system, but they're all different versions of that library which are not mutually compatible and you can only have one of them installed at a time, good luck"
[19:42:35] <sobel> yup, zero support from the OS. thanks for nothing!
[19:42:46] <Para> One of the most common attack vectors was to make a user's browser download a dll with specific name and then just wait until the user runs a Nullsoft installer from downloads folder.
[19:43:02] <ToxicFrog> Para: ok, that's amazing
[19:43:09] <Para> Used to be real fun when IE especially could do that with zero interaction with correct headers.
[19:43:26] <sobel> you could cause a DLL download without user intervention in the bad old days
[19:43:30] <Para> And Nullsoft installer was infamous for not checking _anything_, it was basically a fancy eval function.
[19:43:40] <ToxicFrog> I mean
[19:44:00] <seebs> heh
[19:44:01] <ToxicFrog> Nullsoft was the installer that used its own bespoke language described by the designers, who thought this was a good thing as "combining the best parts of assembly and PHP"
[19:44:03] <seebs> wikipedia: In later years, their open source installer system, the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System became an alternative to commercial products like InstallShield.
[19:44:18] <ToxicFrog> Absolutely nothing about it surprises me, except the fact that it actually works more often than not
[19:44:23] * sobel ugly grimaces at "best parts of assembly and PHP"
[19:44:32] <ToxicFrog> (and I guess the fact that I have legit worked on projects where using NSIS was the least bad option)
[19:44:34] <Para> ...in a script!
[19:44:36] <seebs> this reminds me of the quip about how WordPress is possibly one of the finest remote-access toolkits ever built, and as a bonus, you can use it as a sort of minimal blogging platform
[19:44:38] <sobel> i have to go wash my mind out now
[19:45:19] <sobel> seebs: my whiteboard has one task circled (the rest are merely in lists): Kill off WordPress site(s)
[19:45:24] <Para> ToxicFrog: IIRC that was the time when the other option was Microsoft's MSI packager or whatever it was called? All I remember is people saying it was even worse.
[19:46:01] <Para> Or the one before that, InstallShield Wizard?
[19:46:04] <sobel> a coworker has not got the memo about going through me for new domains/sites. it's frustrating to hear about a new marketing initiative that we already have a weebly/wordpress/whatever site hosted outside of our cloud.
[19:46:34] <sobel> InstallShield was an independent product before MS added it to their Visual suite
[19:46:47] <ToxicFrog> Para: yeah, IIRC at the time if you wanted a smart installer (i.e. not just a self-extracting zip or something) your options were Microsoft Installer, InstallShield, NSIS, or roll your own
[19:47:10] <ToxicFrog> Or I think one or two other "build an installer" products that competed with InstallShield are now justly forgotten
[19:47:21] <ToxicFrog> And they were all terrible, and most of them were also pretty expensive
[19:47:46] <ToxicFrog> Thinking back on when I was doing this it was probably ca. 2004-2006
[19:47:59] <sobel> i used Install4J for a while, when InstallShield was still indie
[19:48:04] <Para> Ah, around when I actually started by BBA studies.
[19:48:14] <sobel> o how i do not miss Install4J
[19:48:31] <Para> Back then I did have a few run-ins with people who didn't understand why I preferred an IDE that works by simply unzipping it to a directory.
[19:48:44] <ToxicFrog> In recent decades I have generally gotten away with either (a) not publishing windows builds at all or (b) releasing a zip file or a self-contained jar without need for a smart installer
[19:48:45] <Para> "Why do you care where Visual Studio installs itself? It's automatic!"
[19:49:42] <Para> My C# basics class started with instructions on how to setup a virtual machine to avoid ruining the actual desktop environment :D
[19:49:56] <sobel> my installs have been much easier these days, now that i know to how to find the code's rundir if a config variable isn't in the environment
[19:49:58] <Para> (it was kinda bad class otherwise, or a bad teacher, maybe both?)
[19:50:18] <Para> I'm still perplexed how plain file IO in JVM is so jank.
[19:50:32] <Para> Thankfully it's not something I have to do a lot.
[19:51:48] <Para> I guess around 06 was the point in general when SaaS started to become a thing, and webapps and whatnot. The idea of installation started to fade.
