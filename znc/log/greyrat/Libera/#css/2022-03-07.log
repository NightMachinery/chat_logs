[02:44:19] <Peppi^> where is a good place to post html code for help?
[02:48:36] <hmw[at]> `paste @ Peppi^
[02:48:36] <Selvvir> Peppi^, These live pastebins allow us to see what you're seeing http://jsfiddle.net/ • http://codepen.io/ • http://paste.asmcbain.net/ • Screenshots can't be inspected with website debugging tools
[02:48:50] <hmw[at]> I like jsfiddle, because it doesn't require making an account
[02:49:48] <hmw[at]> asmcbain's paste is nice too, but simple (can't include frameworks as easily)

[02:54:07] <Peppi^> you want me to use codepen?
[02:54:15] <Peppi^> the heml is only 10ish lines lol
[02:54:15] <hmw[at]> Ideally you would _reduce_ your example, instead of just dumping your full web page in there. Remove anything that does not relate to the issue at hand.
[02:54:24] <Peppi^> I did
[02:54:26] <hmw[at]> Try again pls
[02:54:31] <Peppi^> it's 10 lines of html
[02:54:36] <Peppi^> what are you looking at?
[02:54:51] <Peppi^> https://jsfiddle.net/uvp3q6sa/
[02:54:54] <Peppi^> try this?
[02:55:20] <Peppi^> I just oppened it in another browser and it looks fine
[02:55:29] <Peppi^> well "normal"
[02:57:41] <hmw[at]> A bit much markup :) Does this do, what you want? https://jsfiddle.net/ysfh1rmc/
[02:57:49] <hmw[at]> Peppi^: ^
[02:58:07] <rickame-> do more users expect buttons to be round or square or rounded corners?
[02:58:09] <hmw[at]> inline-block basically turns a thing into a character
[02:58:56] <hmw[at]> rickame-: That depends. I guess Windows users will be used to sharp corners, other people might be used to rounded corners. I certainly am.
[03:00:09] <hmw[at]> Majority of people run their browsers under Windows, I think.
[03:00:47] <Peppi^> hmw[at], I'll take a look
[03:02:42] <Peppi^> hmw[at], btw why can't jsfiddle show the icons?
[03:03:10] <hmw[at]> didn't see anything in there that would make icons. Re-checking.
[03:03:29] <pavonia> I presume for at most 0.1% of all users the roundness of buttons is in the top 10 of main concerns for a website :p
[03:03:53] <Peppi^> pavonia, you think that high?
[03:04:09] <hmw[at]> Peppi^: Yeah, there's only a lot of meta info (lots of attributes), but no actual icons in there. You are probably including a CSS file that gives those classes actual meaning (i.e. icon graphics)
[03:04:12] <pavonia> That's an upper limit
[03:04:51] <Peppi^> hmw[at], ?? you don't see: <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> ?
[03:05:07] <hmw[at]> yeah, but how would a class without CSS rules do _anything_.
[03:06:18] <hmw[at]> You can literally remove every attribute in that fiddle without changing the outcome. You'd have to paste the according CSS, or include the library your actual page is also using.
[03:06:45] <Peppi^> I mean if you go here: https://www.w3schools.com/icons/ and paste it, it shows the icons....
[03:06:49] <hmw[at]> There is an option to automatically include all common libraries, somewhere in the left middle
[03:07:27] <hmw[at]> <link rel="stylesheet"  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"&gt
[03:08:03] <Peppi^> where do I put that?
[03:08:13] <hmw[at]> Peppi^: You can use this as a basis: https://jsfiddle.net/jgwqtf0k/
[03:09:29] <hmw[at]> I fear, you're going to have a hard time with this, if you don't even understand why a class doesn't do anything on its own. Looks like you need to learn a few basics first?
[03:10:49] <hmw[at]> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials <-- better than w3schools IMO
[03:11:04] <Peppi^> https://jsfiddle.net/2ok5j6qa/
[03:11:10] <Peppi^> cleaned it up a little
[03:11:45] <Peppi^> with w3 I meant if you pasted the code it shows the icons just fine
[03:11:59] <Peppi^> https://www.w3schools.com/icons/tryit.asp?filename=tryicons_awesome5
[03:12:33] <hmw[at]> Sure, but you left out quite a bit in your fiddle.
[03:13:41] <hmw[at]> Also, JavaScript just for icons is kind of lame
[03:13:55] <hmw[at]> Peppi^: Can I PM you?
[03:13:58] <Peppi^> hmm?
[03:13:59] <Peppi^> sire
[03:14:00] <Peppi^> sire

[09:28:18] <FunkyBob> an ID must be unique within a document.

[10:37:32] <rickame-> why doesn't .check-container input:checked ~ input:focus work?
[10:37:40] <jargon> Notice the disk doesn't line up with caption in the last row.
[10:37:55] <Peppi^> hello
[10:38:03] <jargon> Hello, Peppi^! :D
[10:38:09] <Peppi^> hmw[at], you around?
[10:38:18] <Peppi^> jargon, hi hi
[10:38:43] <Peppi^> https://jsfiddle.net/2ok5j6qa/4/ I'm trying to get he social icons inline but leave the "call us" and "sales" on a new line. Anyone know how to do this in css?
[10:39:52] <Peppi^> could I do a li a .social-grid-item {} or is that nonsensical
[10:40:06] <jargon> btw, using class instead of id broke my code.
[10:42:29] <jargon> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-rows :(
[10:42:54] <jargon> Goodnight I need to go to bed now.
[10:43:27] <Peppi^> jargon, is that for me?
[10:44:29] <jargon> I just posted what I am working on for my own project.
[10:44:36] <Peppi^> gotcha

[21:24:24] <rendar> hunboy, uhm.. why it works only for the first click?
[21:24:31] <rendar> if i click again, the animation won't start anymore...
[21:24:40] <hunboy> sure
[21:25:26] <rendar> not in my browser (chrome)
[21:26:29] <hunboy> rendar, https://jsfiddle.net/csy9un28/2/
[21:28:25] <rendar> hunboy, i see, ok
[21:28:46] <hunboy> rendar, that was correct behavior, change animation-name from starting to starting is not a real change, so wont fire the animation algorythm. now fixed with deleting the name
[21:29:03] <rendar> yes
[21:29:48] <rendar> the problem of this solution is that if i click it again, the animation won't restart, i have to wait it to finish :(
[21:30:04] <hunboy> yep
[21:30:21] <hunboy> no fast idea how to fix that

[21:41:10] <rendar> hunboy, but i have to modify '3s' in both js and css files
[21:41:17] <rendar> that is not suitable in production

[21:43:17] <rendar> come on, i can't use this in production `e.target.style.animationDuration = '1ms';`
