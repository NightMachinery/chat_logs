[03:06:35] <somiaj> velix: for the most part kernel version isn't that important for the userland, as you mentioned if you need third party modules, then you need to also get versions of those modules compadable with the 5.6 kernel.

[03:11:06] <velix> ahhhh
[03:11:18] <somiaj> the longterm 5.4 is upstream kernel.org support, and you'll have to roll your own kernel
[03:11:25] <velix> okay. got it
[03:11:40] <somiaj> but if you were running 5.6 and going to roll your own kernel anyways, I would suggest 5.4 since it will get support from kernel.org as a longterm branch
[03:12:00] <velix> somiaj: totaly true. I just named 5.6, since it was the last to work.
[03:12:08] <somiaj> personally I would stick with buster and the 4.19 kernel if 5.10 just won't work for you, but running buslleye with busters 4.19 kernel can work.

[03:16:40] <somiaj> oh the 5.10 kernel's aren't working inside the virutalization at your work?
[03:16:58] <velix> somiaj: They lock up the VMs after 5-10 seconds.
[03:17:10] <velix> I tested 5.7-5.13
[03:17:18] <velix> with qemu 5.2 and 6.1
[03:17:37] <velix> works for 5.4 and 5.7 (didn't try 5.5 and 5.6)
[03:18:04] <velix> But since there were maaany changes in 5.7 to SVM (funny: releaded by INTEL), that seems to be the reason.
[03:18:14] <velix> somiaj: http://archive.lwn.net:8080/linux-kernel/20200302235709.27467-65-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com/

[03:19:07] <somiaj> hmm, bullseye vms work fine here onqemu 5.2, I think they worked fine from buster too with 3.1
[03:19:19] <somiaj> though I have limited testing with this
[03:19:41] <velix> Remember, I'm already on a KVM.
[03:19:43] <somiaj> ahh I don't use nested vms, probaby the issue
[03:19:47] <velix> yep
[03:19:48] <xnu> yeah
[03:20:08] <somiaj> inception, a dream inside a dream, soon you'll need to use a vm inside yoru vm inside your vm

[03:20:19] <velix> on kernel 5.4 I can do anything.
[03:20:28] <velix> Windows is performing as native.
[03:20:30] <somiaj> velix: anyways, why do you need bullseye vms? Would buster vms work just fine?
[03:20:47] <somiaj> that might be another option, oldstable with lts support will be supported for a while
[03:21:21] <velix> somiaj: Actually ... long story again. I'm using Proxmox7 and this is bullseye only. So I just think of upgrading to proxmox v7 and downgrade the kernel to 5.4.

[03:22:37] <somiaj> have you contacted proxmox support about this. We don't really support proxmox here, but this sounds like something they should support
[03:22:46] <velix> somiaj: Yep. It's 100% not a proxmox problem.
[03:22:50] <velix> and I don't need support on that.
[03:23:18] <velix> I'm was NOT using proxmox for this.
[03:23:27] <velix> I was using minimal Buster and Bullseye.
[03:23:35] <velix> and qemu
[03:23:43] <velix> So: please remove proxmox from this equation.

[03:24:11] <somiaj> but I would stick with buster if the 5.10 kernel isn't working if at all possible
[03:24:23] <velix> My setup actually isn't exotic. It's common on huge servers.
[03:24:37] <velix> At University, we've got such a huge Xen server with maaany Intel CPUs with maany cores.
[03:24:40] <somiaj> if you are going to roll your own kernel, 5.4 is what I would go with due to lts support from kernel.org
[03:25:41] <velix> somiaj: Actually, I'm using Proxmox only to create, start/stop stuff with a GUI. I'm not using any network config stuff, firewall etc.
[03:25:45] <velix> Maybe I can even live without it.
[03:26:11] <somiaj> libvirt + virt-manager?
[03:26:32] <velix> somiaj: Yeah, might be an alternative. But it's not like I'll create and drop VMs on an hourly level :D
[03:27:12] <velix> Let me google a bit. Maybe someone is keeping updated 5.4 kernels for Buster or Bullseye.
[03:28:02] <velix> Maybe even a paid service. It's fine for me.
[03:30:15] <somiaj> my guess is some other distro is using 5.4, which works with upstream to give it longterm support
[03:30:52] <velix> yeah, maybe someone is paying, since it got extended by 3 years.

[03:34:41] <velix> ah nice.
[03:34:59] <somiaj> well my suggestion is to roll your own kernel using upstream sources, but since ubuntu is using it, it will recive security support

[03:37:11] <velix> somiaj: Sure. 5.6 just was the last version to work. 5.4 is fine for me.
[03:37:30] <somiaj> but I doubt there is anyone making and supporting 5.4 kernels for debian, this is something you'll have to do yourself

[03:54:49] <Blondie101010> hmm

[03:55:27] <Blondie101010> couldn't they give you the number of VPS you actually need instead of having to do that?

[04:47:04] <Blondie101010> why not?

[04:47:49] <tharkun> Tried it before and it utterly failed. ( Do not ask me what type of filesystem was used. ext*)

[04:55:12] <somiaj> tharkun: for vfat/exfat/ntfs, linux will just give all images the same permissions using options like uid,gid,umask,fmask,dmask, so you can configure what permissions the volumn has on your system.
[04:55:40] <somiaj> so you can change mount options if you say want a user to be able to write to the files
[04:55:47] <Blondie101010> it's actually very dangerous to use on / because of the absence of controls

[05:13:25] <tharkun> Blondie101010: The main filesystem for each OS is their native OS. The external hdds are to be used to read/write large files. Some are up to 400GB but a huge amount of them are 14GB in size. NTFS is a pita outside of windows and it seems for the article that you kindly mentioned ext4 is not natively supported on MacOS.
[05:14:26] <tharkun> For the time being the path that somiaj stated seems to be the way to go. File permissions although important on this particular project can be put on the side line. At least that is what I think.

[11:21:29] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>
[11:24:39] <MsK`> if debian doesn't want to support PPAs it should remove PPAs.
[11:26:15] <Blondie101010> MsK`:  you came to an official support channel and got the official answer
[11:26:42] <MsK`> with 692 people here, I expected more than a bot answer, but ok
[11:26:45] <themill> getting rid of the packages from deb-multimedia is non-trvial.
[11:27:26] <Blondie101010> it might be fixable but in most cases could justify a full reinstall
[11:27:26] <themill> Best bet is often to force remove them with dpkg and then ask apt to fix things up... depends on how much crap you've installed from there, however
[11:27:59] <MsK`> interesting idea
[11:28:19] <Blondie101010> be sure to have a rescue drive handy
[11:28:27] <MsK`> I already cleaned up a bit manually, what's left is mostly libraries so that should work

[13:46:16] <PMT> cadmio: i'd try removing it entirely from /etc/network/interfaces, then setting up wpa_supplicant manually with the appropriate essid/key, then manually assigning an ip, and seeing if you can get anywhere. then try with dhcp if you can. then try to figure out where interfaces is going wrong.

[13:54:19] <xnu> Now that I think about it, what's wrong with that naming... I've never seen such a long name before...
[13:57:29] <PMT> offhand i was assuming it was the MAC

[14:01:49] <xnu> ok.. my bad... there's no 3/3 in my dmesg too... but there's 2/3 but then I'm not sure if it has something to do with WPA2 auth.

[23:54:06] <wd50> but yeah, that is pretty cool.
