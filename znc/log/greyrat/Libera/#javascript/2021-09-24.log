[00:12:42] <teut> React components are just functions which take in arguments and return jsx which compiles to dom nodes.       would  this be a correct statement? I m writing a report for school
[00:13:00] <ljharb> fakuve: yes, but you shouldn't rely on that since there's lots of edge cases
[00:13:00] <teut> major concern is "dom nodes"
[00:13:06] <ljharb> teut: no, not dom nodes
[00:13:10] <teut> then?
[00:13:16] <ljharb> teut: JSX transpiles to `React.createElement` calls, which produce React element objects.
[00:13:21] <teut> React.createElement
[00:13:23] <teut> yes that
[00:13:31] <ljharb> (also, there's React class components too)
[00:13:41] <teut> ya but I ve used hooks
[00:13:50] <ljharb> components with hooks are functions, sure.
[00:14:05] <teut> oh ok, let me correct that, thanks
[00:14:15] <fakuve> ljharb: cheers again
[00:14:17] <ljharb> React _renders_ a tree of react components into a tree of react elements, which it uses to construct a virtual DOM, which it uses to update the actual DOM (which is where the DOM nodes are)
[00:15:42] <teut> so at the end  does it uses  the  js  createElement or not?

[01:45:15] <austincheney> then it is easy if myBuffer.length < 126 then the length header is literally the payload length (0-125) buffer indexes.  If it is 126 indexes then what do I need the next two bytes of extended length for if I already believe the byte length is 126?

[08:26:59] <Crash1hd> theskillwithin, yes I can subscribe to the observable and pass the data to this.dataSource and it works just fine.
[08:28:10] <Crash1hd> but what I am wondering is why have they not figured out a way to have the MatTableDataSource be the default for [dataSource]='...|async' as this is self closing and i do not have to worry about adding a takeuntil or unsubscribe from it.

[09:43:23] <Koopz> if you had a table full with data and a bunch of form controls to filter that data, would you prefer that over a single search bar that could do everything?

[09:45:52] <theskillwithin> Koopz yes
[09:46:08] <thykka> a single search field may work, if common searches won't produce lots of "false positives", lots of controls is probably slower to use, but could possibly yield more refined results
[09:46:50] <theskillwithin> in a way its a question you have to answer for yourself, cuz we don't know your datas

[09:54:51] <sheetjs> you can do a data validation

[09:55:33] <theskillwithin> sheetjs its not porn is it?
[09:55:48] <theskillwithin> i hope not
[09:55:50] <sheetjs> the confusing part of the question is the relationship to spreadsheets
[09:55:57] <Koopz> i was just wondering if it'd be nicer to have a field where you could enter "Source: OVA, ONA Genres: Action, Comedy"
[09:56:03] <theskillwithin> sheetjs thats why i pinged you
[09:56:10] <theskillwithin> im confused
[09:56:17] <sheetjs> why are spreadsheets involved?

[09:56:57] <sheetjs> well it didn't have adult content, but talked about XXX
[09:58:28] <Koopz> i don't quite get why a dropdown with 2 options, one being "Manga" and one being "Anime" confuse you
[09:58:49] <Koopz> is it the terms themselves?
[09:59:07] <Koopz> Manga being japanese comics and Anime being japanese cartoons
[09:59:15] <theskillwithin> sorry this is my bad, i assumed load meant upload a spreadsheet,  and i was clearly wrong
[09:59:24] <Koopz> ah

[10:26:15] <Koopz> especially if you want to go absolutely nuts with logiv
[10:26:19] <Koopz> logic*
[10:27:02] <Koopz> like for example the Genre filter currently only filters the data down to entries that match all genres you picked
[10:28:17] <Koopz> but what if you want to get a list of entries that have "Comedy + (Romance | Slice of Life)"

[14:08:26] <thykka> Swahili, is there a build step?
[14:09:14] <Swahili> thykka: hi! did a grep for buffer, and nothing there; one of the packages does have a "create react" but still...
[14:09:20] <Swahili> I'm quite surprised its working

[14:10:15] <Swahili> thykka: this just to confirm that Buffer definitely is not available in the browser right
[14:10:21] <thykka> browserify will automagically polyfill Buffer
[14:10:27] <thykka> right
[14:11:04] <Swahili> thykka: without need for the dev to set that up?
[14:11:30] <thykka> that would depend on what they start with. Many frameworks/boilerplates might have it preinstalled and preconfigured
[14:11:51] <Swahili> thykka: right
[14:12:20] <thykka> but there's no need to explicitly import it, browserify will detect if you're using Buffer in the code
[14:13:53] <Swahili> thykka: right, I'll check the react chan' and see if someone knows something about that with create react
[14:16:48] <k_sze> A slightly dumb question: given that both Jest and Mocha, by default, try to inject their own `it()`, `describe()`, etc. into the global namespace, is there a way to use both libraries in the same project without confusion?

[15:21:57] <thykka> Deneb, checkboxes are replaced elements. You can't style them directly, because their appearance depend on the user's operating system. You can, however, replace the default checkbox with your own.
[15:22:05] <Deneb> Rockwood: simples, just: <input type="checkbox" id="fileSecret" class="storestyle1">
[15:22:18] <Deneb> storestyle1 in the CSS file contains the styling
[15:22:27] <Rockwood> make a test case
[15:22:42] <Rockwood> i am sure you are missing something
[15:22:51] <Deneb> thykka: you can't style checkboxes?
[15:22:51] <swn> Nah, checkboxes just don't take styling.
[15:23:24] <Rockwood> swn, are you sure?
[15:23:29] <Deneb> swn: ok same thought as per thykka. Didn't know that.
[15:23:30] <swn> positive
[15:23:54] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Property_compatibility_table_for_form_controls#check_boxes_and_radio_buttons
[15:24:09] <Deneb> yes, also just found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4148499/how-to-style-a-checkbox-using-css
[15:24:20] <swn> there's ways around it, like making your own checkbox out of a <label> and hiding the actual checkbox. if you search "custom checkbox" you'll find a bunch of stuff I'm sure
[15:24:52] <thykka> yes. The checkbox itself cannot be styled, but it can be hidden, and replaced with a custom built checkbox.
[15:25:49] <Deneb> thykka: see what you mean. Most styling options for checkboxes are N/A. Seems a bit weird.
[15:26:39] <thykka> not weird when you consider how they're rendered. MacOS checkboxes look very different from windows checkboxes, and they do not share a common way of styling.

[15:27:37] <Rockwood> .myinput[type="checkbox"]:before
[15:27:46] <Rockwood> its not css?
[15:28:02] <thykka> one often overlooked, but important UX principle is to not mess with chrome (that is, the appearance and behavior of system-provided UI elements). People may have special needs, and have customized their OS to display checkboxes with more contrast, or such
[15:28:10] <swn> that affects the psuedo :before element, not the checkbox itself
[15:28:14] <thykka> thus overriding those preferences is bad for accessibility
[15:28:25] <Rockwood> its styling on checkbox
[15:28:38] <swn> it's styling on the pseudo :before element before the checkbox
[15:29:00] <thykka> and even when not talking about disability needs, it's generally best not to force users to figure out what [your version of a checkbox] does, if it's too different from an OS provided control

[15:30:23] <thykka> side note: a yes/no dropdown has the benefit of distinguishing "no" from "no answer"
[15:30:31] <Deneb> surely the rendering argument applies to any control so why should checkboxes be different?

[16:12:52] <thykka> it's not active?
[16:12:56] <Rockwood> suppose if user clicked on this there should only show only children of this
[16:13:07] <Rockwood> "label": "subNerve1",
[16:13:45] <thykka> DnzAtWrk, active is when an element is being pressed, nothing to do with an indeterminate checkbox state

[16:16:23] <thykka> to be fair, I don't think I've ever used indeterminate state myself, but if you're making a checkbox style library, then it would be good to have full support of native features :)

[16:23:49] <DnzAtWrk> if you want to make good icons, I recommend you make a file in inkscape in which you lay out all your icons in a grid
[16:24:06] *** Joins: ArchNoob (~maotora@user/archnoob)

[16:24:18] <DnzAtWrk> put each icon + background in its own object group
[16:24:27] <DnzAtWrk> and then create a batch export script which loops through the groups
[16:24:39] <DnzAtWrk> easy way to mass export icons for whatever purpose
[16:25:19] <DnzAtWrk> in inkscape command line you can export a group by bounds, into a png file
[16:25:46] <thykka> I prefer svg symbols
[16:25:57] <DnzAtWrk> svg is cumbersome
[16:26:23] <thykka> compared to raster images, sure, but there's a lot to gain from a vector format
[16:26:38] <earendel> true typed fonts are like svg
[16:26:40] <DnzAtWrk> yes, but you are trusting the browser to render it correctly
[16:26:42] <thykka> like, recoloring svg is a lot less wasteful when you can just re-use it
[16:26:53] <thykka> when do they not render correctly?
[16:26:54] <DnzAtWrk> it's easy to make non-working vector art in inkscape
[16:27:00] <DnzAtWrk> for example when you use filters
[16:27:23] <thykka> well yeah, that's because inkscape has it's own extensions to SVG, which aren't part of SVG itself
[16:27:26] <DnzAtWrk> or when there are some insane intersections
[16:27:32] <thykka> it's not a failing of SVG though
[16:27:50] <thykka> seems like a classic case of garbage in - garbage out
[16:28:03] <DnzAtWrk> yeah, cumbersome
[16:28:10] <DnzAtWrk> when you can get garbage in nice icons out
[16:28:15] <thykka> https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/
[16:29:15] <thykka> fwiw, i have never had a problem of an SVG displaying incorrectly like that. And if I did, I'd have a chat with the designer who made it, so that they understand the limitations of the medium they're using
[16:29:29] <DnzAtWrk> I've attempted to use svg before for some games
[16:29:33] <DnzAtWrk> pain in le' arse

[16:30:20] <thykka> i made a pipeline for optimizing them, and combining them into a "spritesheet"

[20:18:04] <sudorm> Hi! What's the best, crossbrowser to have no error and have this working if available:
[20:18:05] <sudorm> Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone
[20:18:11] <sudorm> and if not available, just an empty string?
[20:18:53] <sudorm> var a = (typeof Intl !== 'undefined') ?  Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone : '';
[20:19:29] <sudorm> Problem: this would fail if a browser has Intl defined, but not Intl.DateFormat, etc.
[20:20:29] <sudorm> so should I *really* test:  (typeof Intl !== 'undefined') && (typeof Intl.DateTimeFormat !== 'undefined') && (typeof Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions !== 'undefined')
[20:20:35] <sudorm> etc?
[20:21:26] <Alexendoo> sudorm: You can use optional chaining (with babel for older browsers)
[20:21:58] <sudorm> Alexendoo, without babel, without third party library, what would you use? What is optional chaining here?

[23:42:17] <patchie> I am making a greasemonkey script, and have a webpage with links to pdf documents and image files. I created a script that shows the image files in a div next to the mouse on hovering over links.
[23:42:29] <patchie> for showing pdf's i use iframe, and it works in my test .html file i created, but when i wanna do this using greasemonkey, it dont show the pdf file, but rather just downloads the pdf file :S
[23:42:42] <patchie> is it possible to either force to not download the content of the iframe? or use <embed> or similar?
