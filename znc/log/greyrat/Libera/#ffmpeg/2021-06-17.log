[00:33:34] <jspiros> I don't think ffmpeg can do that but if I'm missing that it can, that'd be fine too, but either way I figure someone here might know something

[00:36:05] <intrac> KittySaysMeow: yes the EnableDelayedExpansion code snippet seems to be about twice the duration
[00:36:08] <jspiros> (got a counterfeit DVD on eBay and want to collect some evidence)
[00:37:09] <intrac> if you're looping back to that one, then you only want to fade to it right at the end
[00:37:59] <kepstin> jspiros: yeah, ffmpeg has no dvd-input support at all (aside from that it can read single-angle mpeg ps vob files directly)
[00:38:25] <intrac> KittySaysMeow: I'm also not sure what each of the -t 3.5 is doing on the inputs
[00:38:36] <kepstin> jspiros: you could take a look at the "dvdbackup" tool, it has some command line options to print disk info and some verbose otpions, it might reveal what you're looking for.
[00:38:56] <jspiros> kepstin: great, I'll take a look at that, thanks :)
[00:39:01] <intrac> it might be totally fine, but I would let the inputs loop (possibly infinitely) mix between them with xfade, then set a single -t option near the output
[00:39:25] <jspiros> I know it doesn't have CSS, but one tool I use (lsdvd) doesn't actually print whether it does or not, I just know it doesn't have CSS because, well, it doesn't, it reads fine without invoking DeCSS
[00:39:38] <jspiros> but yeah, I'll check that tool out, sounds promising
[00:40:06] <furq> if you can play a vob directly off the disc then there's no css
[00:40:16] <intrac> KittySaysMeow: also you might want to also specify -r on each of the inputs (I think ffmpeg will default to 25fps for image sequences)
[00:40:20] <intrac> which might be confusing things
[00:40:24] <kepstin> jspiros: yeah, "dvdbackup -I -i /dev/sr0" will print out some logs about retrieving CSS keys if there are any at startup, and then also dump the dvd structure info.
[00:40:49] <furq> libdvdcss will only get invoked if you play the entire disc structure in the way dvdnav expects
[00:41:07] <furq> at least in both the players i know of that use dvdnav
[00:41:54] <kepstin> note that due to scrambling, you will actually be unable to read files off an encrypted dvd (it will give io errors and fail to mount) until you run a tool using libdvdcss to authenticate to the drive.
[00:43:07] <furq> i've seen discs where it would play but the picture would be scrambled
[00:43:10] <furq> but either way it'll be obvious
[00:43:18] <kepstin> the exact behaviour of that depends on the drive tho, sometime after you've authenticated once it lets you access future disks without authenticating again
[00:43:27] <jspiros> I use dvdisaster to test all discs I buy, and I used to use vlc to authenticate the drive, until I discovered lsdvd uses libdvdcss, so I just use lsdvd to get it authenticated for the test
[00:43:54] <jspiros> didn't need to do it for this disc, and along with other physical abnormalities, tis a counterfeit (of an out of print title, being sold at high price)

[00:55:02] <KittySaysMeow> image viewer with frames stats shows that after last cross-fade animation is not stopped, the frame stays for a while
[00:55:21] <KittySaysMeow> here lies the crux... of that delay :D
[00:55:49] <intrac> KittySaysMeow: right, I'm just wondering what -t is doing. it's my understanding that when you specify multiple input images/video/audio streams
[00:56:04] <intrac> they are run at the same time (concurrently)
[00:56:18] <intrac> which makes sense if you specify separate video and audio files this way
[00:56:24] <intrac> you don't want the audio to start after the video
[00:56:36] <intrac> so that said, it seems like the inputs are all just 3.5 seconds long
[00:56:55] <intrac> but some of your timings in the xfade params exceed that
[00:57:06] <intrac> I don't think the framerate (-r) issue I mentioned is important
[00:57:31] <intrac> although I think ffmpeg might be processing at 25fps right through to the end where you set it to -r 10
[00:57:42] <intrac> and would then drop frames.
[00:58:02] <intrac> this will happen in a slightly irregular way, since 25 doesn't fit down to 10 by simple dropping (eg every other frame)
[00:58:18] <intrac> so you might see some uneveness in the fades (although it will probably be subtle)
[01:00:27] <intrac> KittySaysMeow: can you post the params for the last gif you linked to?
[01:01:25] <intrac> I've opened it in the GIMP and its 125 frames at 100ms a frame (10fps). so 12.6 seconds duration

[05:13:49] <jspiros> I think it might be, but as software can interact with those concepts at times, I expect it's something that can be fetched from the drive
[05:14:37] <jspiros> same thing goes with the type of media it is; presumably that's not stored as data on the disc, but the drive can report to software that it's a CD-R or a DVD-R or a pressed DVD-ROM or whatever, but I don't know nearly enough about this to speak authoritatively :)

[05:27:41] <Tosin> I want to avoid running a transcoding process
[05:27:52] <BtbN> You're dealing with raw pcm anyway
[05:28:03] <BtbN> Nothing to encode there
[05:28:25] <Tosin> Is this to me?
[05:28:30] <BtbN> hm?
[05:28:49] <Tosin> The part about the pcm
[05:28:54] <kepstin> Tosin: the "encoder" for raw pcm is basically a passthrough that turns the AVFrame into an AVPacket so it can be sent to the muxer.
[05:28:55] <BtbN> It's wav files
[05:29:40] *** Quits: Zucca (~Zucca@user/zucca) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[05:29:52] <BtbN> You really just need to demux your wav file, "deocde" it, run whatever filters and manual filtering you like, "encode" again, and mux
[05:29:56] <jspiros> furq: hmm
[05:30:12] <BtbN> Not sure if you can skip the pseudo-transcoding, knowing that it's all just raw pcm
[05:30:26] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[05:30:27] <BtbN> Could probably manually convert between frame and packet, but using lavc is easier for sure
[05:30:32] <furq> jspiros: apparently vlc and handbrake will print those log messages
[05:30:43] <jspiros> furq: I'll give that a try, thanks
[05:32:02] <jspiros> I should grep the source of libdvd* and see if there's a point where it logs whether CSS is even present and/or whether no keys were found, maybe stick my own log line in somewhere strategic to accomplish the same goal if not
[05:33:28] <kepstin> jspiros: part of the weirdness of the dvdcss stuff is that it was designed to be a drop-in to the dvdread libraries to add css support without changing any of the apis (many distros didn't ship with css support, but it could be easily added)
[05:33:31] <Tosin> So kepstin earlier today I was looking at decode_audio.c, correct if I'm wrong but that file basically just decodes the input audio file right and produces the same output?

[22:09:08] <StayHungry> Hmm, let's try my luck tonight… :)
[22:09:20] <StayHungry> Evening, comrades. Anyone familiar with xfade filter?
[22:10:51] <StayHungry> Official page gives an example on how to use it to crossfade between two images by means of specifying each input separately via -i switch
[22:11:22] <StayHungry> I wonder, however, how to change it to work with a bunch of images, i.e. 10
[22:11:54] <StayHungry> it is cumbersome to specify each image as input

[22:36:46] <kepstin> StayHungry: no easy way, the xfade filter specifically takes 2 inputs so you'd need to add another xfade filter for each new image being crossfaded anyways
[22:37:15] <StayHungry> that's what I was afraid of
[22:37:38] <StayHungry> but even going this way I encountered a difficulty
[22:38:09] <kepstin> if you just want to make a slideshow video, i'm sure there's dedicated tools around that would be much easier to use :/
[22:38:17] <StayHungry> i tried to animate 3 images into gif and the last gif had a delay which i had to remove manually via gifsicle app
[22:38:17] <kepstin> (i don't offhand know what one might be, tho)
[22:38:33] <StayHungry> *last frame
[22:40:13] <StayHungry> ffmpeg -loop 1 -t 5.5 -i in1.png -loop 1 -t 5.5 -i in2.png -loop 1 -t 5.5 -i in3.png -lavfi "[0][1]xfade=transition=wiperight:duration=0.5:offset=5[mix1];[mix1][2]xfade=transition=wiperight:duration=0.5:offset=10[mix2];[mix2][0]xfade=transition=wiperight:duration=0.5:offset=15[out]" -map [out] -r 15 out.gif
[22:41:16] <StayHungry> https://s3.rokket.space/t_k2E7Pc.gif
[22:42:27] <StayHungry> i can add progress-bar here to make the last delay more noticeable https://s3.rokket.space/t_qLpz0I.gif
[22:44:48] <StayHungry> now i remove that delay manually and... voila https://s3.rokket.space/t_6bkwBc.gif

[22:45:11] <StayHungry> the great mystery for me here is why ffmpeg adds that delay in the first place
[22:46:22] <StayHungry> surely i can remove frames manually because i create animations not that often, but heck we live in 21st century where computers are supposed to make our lives easier, not harder :D
