[21:48:41] <xx> (guessing from that 'purple' realname)
[21:48:42] <fuko> yes
[21:48:54] <xx> pidgin supports SOCKS5, so no need to mess with the torrc config file
[21:49:46] <xx> you can simply start tor on port 9050, configure SOCKS5 proxy in pidgin to point to localhost:9050, and configure the server hostname as the onion address libera75jm6of4wxpxt4aynol3xjmbtxgfyjpu34ss4d7r7q2v5zrpyd.onion
