[01:14:33] <Namarrgon> or however you spell it
[01:14:39] <grawity> terminology looks quite alive to me
[01:14:51] <thrice> terminology is definitely alive
[01:15:16] <coruja> i used to use lxterminal (vte-based), now having switched to kitty

[01:18:19] <sangy> Is alacritty also gpu based?
[01:18:37] <UndeadLeech> It uses OpenGL for rendering.
[01:19:47] <sangy> how can my gpu be real if my eyes aren't real tho
[01:20:01] <UndeadLeech> Virtualization.
[01:20:57] <sangy> wait alacritty is written in rust?
[01:21:05] <UndeadLeech> Aye.
[01:21:21] <sangy> ah I"m a total slut for the crab. let's goo
[01:21:22] <UndeadLeech> Not that being written in Rust changes much.
[01:21:42] <sangy> it changes everything™
[01:22:14] <dav1d> who needs hardware accelerated terminals, your eyes can only see 24 fps anyways
[01:22:22] <jelle> sangy: raster might be upstream of terminology :p
[01:22:32] <speak> termite got deprecated and recommends alacritty. But... alacritty has no url hints ;___;  (unless I've missed them)
[01:22:40] <jelle> speak: it has
[01:22:45] <sangy> jelle: oh TIL
[01:22:57] <Namarrgon> not only is he upstream but he's also downstream
[01:23:01] <sangy> ugh, now I need to learn some stupid config file format for my terminal again
[01:23:04] <jelle> sangy: I only know he does EFL stuff :P
[01:23:04] <UndeadLeech> If by hints you mean vimium-like URL highlighting, that's supported with 0.8.0+.

[01:33:09] <raster> thsoe errors are almost all safe - ie code detected an issues, complained, gave u athat backtrace and moved on

[01:33:37] <raster> those traces are for devs to use and fix the issue it'\'s pointing out - but they are not generally critical
[01:33:46] <raster> most of them are "trying to access invalid object"
[01:33:57] <raster> and so that access becomes a NOP anyway
[01:34:18] <UndeadLeech> speak: 0.8.0 is a bit crashy, 0.9.9 should hopefully release within a week though.
[01:34:24] <sangy> raster: got it
[01:34:25] <raster> sometimes its other complaints like the focus system finds an object outside of the focus tree and can't walk to it and will drop to a fallback path
[01:34:25] <UndeadLeech> 0.9.0*
[01:34:26] <raster> etc.
[01:34:37] <raster> it should not have died...
[01:34:43] <raster> unless its some OTHER error

[01:35:28] <raster> well ikt'd be worth using because it can do a lot
[01:35:33] <raster> it can run in a tty
[01:35:37] <raster> so go to a text console
[01:35:42] <raster> long it and turn terminology
[01:35:43] *** Quits: merdely (~merdely@user/merdely) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[01:35:45] <raster> it'll work
[01:35:50] <sangy> huh interesting
[01:35:54] <raster> it'll even be able to use gl accel there (
[01:36:10] <sangy> wtf you weren't kidding
[01:36:18] <sangy> I even have that nyancat thingie I used to have
[01:36:21] <raster> run elementary_config and select opengl rendering under rendering)
[01:36:36] <raster> it can use gl in either x, wl or the tty
[01:36:46] <raster> it's a bi-product of efl being able to do this
[01:36:54] <raster> and efl powers enlightenment
[01:37:26] <raster> and it's both an x11 wm+compositor and wayland compositor (for e to run in a tty as a compositor it uses the same efl support to do this that then lets terminology work this way)
[01:37:55] <raster> so essentially if you run it in a tty you get a fullscreen terminal with a mouse working - you can use tabs/splits like in a window in x11 or wl too
[01:38:27] <raster> anyway - if you find a bug or problem, please report it upstream
[01:38:36] <sangy> raster: fwiw, this is the error https://paste.xinu.at/raTxCn/

[01:39:13] <sangy> it does seem the terminal gets stuck
[01:39:16] <raster> sangy:  aah thats the trace
[01:39:21] <sangy> weird thing is, on a tty it does blow up
[01:39:24] <raster> right above that it will tell you the actual issue
[01:39:28] <sangy> doesnt*
[01:39:31] <susi> can you make alacritty open links with keyboard?
[01:39:46] <raster> but this i smell is just the focus manager unable to find the proper focus graph solution so it falls back to something else - ignore it
[01:40:04] <UndeadLeech> susi: Configured to ctrl+shift+u by default for vimium-style URL selection, alternatively you can also use the vi mode.
[01:40:18] <sangy> raster: it's strange, it doesn't seem to get focus at all. Could it be that the tiling wm gets in the way somehow?
[01:40:39] *** Quits: Szadek (~Szadek@185.254.75.46) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[01:40:47] <raster> if terminology is stuck.. it'll be a different thing. as i mentioned - try efl-git and terminology-git. lots of bugs get fixed in upstream long before a release comes out. git is generally really stable (i'd say more stable than releases as it gets more fixes)
[01:41:00] <raster> hmmm no focus? that's ... odd.

[01:41:46] <raster> so terminology will just be waiting on your wm to go do that... until then kbd input wont go to it and it cant be interacted with.
[01:41:58] <sangy> it's funny, if I start it from annother emulator, it "clones" whatever is displayed and it doesn't respon to keypresses and such. If I start it from the wm shell it just doesn't show up
[01:42:09] <raster> (input is sent directly from the xserver to the app - ie terminology. wm's just set focus - ie tell x WHICH window to send kbd input to)
[01:42:33] <raster> aaah that would be it not rendering - its inherited just what is there on screen.

[02:39:31] <mort> the primary way people interact with the AUR is through AUR helpers
[02:39:40] <alad> why did you even bother to ask your question if you're convinced that you should already cater to people doing whatever things you think they're doing
[02:39:42] <mort> earnestly: it's an argument about empirics!
[02:39:52] <earnestly> Quantity is boring
[02:40:07] <jtritz> mort: principles which guide behavior are generally not formed by behavior, they are formed by thinking about behavior, and even trying to correct for behavioral norms
[02:40:09] <earnestly> And no one actually cares about the numbers
[02:40:18] <mort> jtritz: irrelvant
[02:40:24] <mort> irrelevant*
[02:40:35] <Namarrgon> i do care when the taco quantity in my house drops below 1
[02:40:42] <Foxboron> Namarrgon: :O

[02:41:09] <cdrp> uhm
[02:41:11] <placebo> everyone chill out and play their steam deck
[02:41:18] <mort> alad: I asked if I should update the AUR package so that AUR helper users can update the package with `yay -Syu`. It seems like the answer is no, because, contrary to what Namarrgon says, AUR helpers do that automatically by maintaining a list of repositories.
[02:41:21] <jessicara> wouldn't be linux channel without some argument about semantics. seriously though, thanks for arch existing, sits on the line between new packages/easy enough/smol which seems near ideal for purposes
[02:41:25] <cdrp> !grab Namarrgon
[02:41:25] <phrik> cdrp: Tada!
[02:41:27] <demonicm1niac> the argument can be made that most people using the aur through aur helpers are people using unofficial install scripts that come with aur helpers by default which in turn is then not what we call arch
[02:41:28] <alad> what
[02:41:29] <mort> alad: so this is a side discussion about whether one should even care about AUR users for some reason
[02:41:33] <alad> AUR helpers maintain a list of repositories...?
[02:41:35] <demonicm1niac> and by that logic no, not most arch users use an aur helper
[02:41:37] <pulec> placebo: we gotta wait for gabe to come visit at christmas
[02:41:38] <mort> yay does
[02:41:42] <mort> according to its docs
[02:41:47] <alad> you mean that gendb thing?
[02:41:49] <Namarrgon> mort: yay has a switch for updating vcs packages, like i said. if the user doesn't know about it then it's not your problem.
[02:41:51] <mort> I think so?
[02:41:54] <Foxboron> alad: "repositories" in the git sense.
[02:41:58] <alad> ah
[02:42:02] <mort> well yeah
[02:42:06] * pulec taps fedora to alad and jumps to ubuntu
[02:42:07] <mort> we're talking about -git packages
[02:42:09] <alad> that makes this hwole discussion even more pointless
[02:42:22] <mort> what does
[02:42:24] <pulec> mort: how many repositories do you use?
[02:42:37] <alad> you want to support people using aur helpers, yet the aur helpers already supports the thing you have in mind
[02:42:45] <mort> pulec: I don't even run Arch at the moment
[02:42:49] <alad> lol
[02:42:50] <pulec> rip
[02:42:52] <Namarrgon> ugh
[02:42:52] <alad> awesome
[02:42:53] <placebo> i'm likely wrong but in terms of -git AUR packages, i think the only thing you update besides the build steps (if needed) is the git tag/commit
[02:43:22] <pulec> I think it's common for fedora or ubuntu users to use shitload of repositories, sometimes even a repository per one program
[02:43:25] <pulec> which is just dumb imho
[02:43:29] <mort> alad: I didn't know about that yay feature before morganamilo mentioned it
[02:43:33] <pulec> rpm sux, I hate them with all my energy
[02:43:48] <Namarrgon> placebo: as long as nothing about the build process of the upstream project changes and you wrote a sold pkgver() function then you don't update anything in the PKGBUILD
[02:43:51] <alad> all the aur helpers have some "update my git packages" flag which Namarrgon mentioned 3 pages up
[02:43:55] <Namarrgon> *solid

[02:44:25] <mort> but if the convention in arch is for the maintainer to not upgrade -git packages, that's perfectly fine by me
[02:44:25] <Foxboron> jessicara: someone is going to claim Manjaro is more popular then Arch, any moment now
[02:44:30] <jessicara> lol
[02:44:34] <mort> I'm not arguing that I should cater to aur helper users
[02:44:41] <mort> *in ways which other packages don't, I mean
[02:44:48] <cdrp> jessicara: isn't arch just upstream fedora
[02:44:50] * cdrp runs
[02:44:58] <alad> manjaro is more popular than arch, it's preinstalled on laptops from the local turkish street vendor
[02:45:07] <jessicara> nah really, fedora is alright too, is nice to have a somewhat sane set of default security boundaries if set something up for someone not so interested in the detail, or a throw away vm
[02:45:08] <Foxboron> alad: ah, yes.
[02:45:12] <mort> I'm just disagreeing with this fucking elitism that nobody should use AUR helpers, and even arguing that AUR helpers aren't the primary way people interact with the AUR
[02:45:17] <placebo> manjaro is on the steam deck
[02:45:26] <placebo> (not really)
[02:45:36] <jessicara> but i think the host for vms here will be stuck on arch for a long time
[02:45:40] <alad> lol, it's not "nobody should use any aur helpers", it's your claim that "aur helpers is the PRIMARY way to use the aur"

[02:45:51] <alad> but I'm tired of this, you don't even use arch so why are you even here
[02:45:51] <mort> alad: aren't they? Do you have the numbers?

[02:46:10] <Namarrgon> we don't care about the numbers, they are not important
[02:46:17] <mort> the numbers are literally what we're arguing about
[02:46:33] <Namarrgon> alright, you win
[02:46:36] <mort> alad doesn't think AUR helpers are the primary way through which people interact with the AUR. That implies that most people are doing the git clone approach
[02:46:42] <earnestly> The primary way to use the AUR is the way officially supported by Arch Linux

[02:47:35] <demonicm1niac> so it's pointless to argue about it
[02:47:49] <alad> yes, the * primary* way is what the user manual tells you

[02:48:09] <cdrp> demonicm1niac: there is. for example, see when AUR went down recently after pamac added autocompletion for aur packages

[02:48:47] <cdrp> demonicm1niac: i meant there is logging. see the conversations that took place on the infrastructure gitlab
[02:48:47] <mort> anyways, if we just disagree about the definition of the word "primary" then I suppose I can leave that point

[02:49:17] <Namarrgon> we don't care about that either
[02:49:19] <demonicm1niac> cdrp: oh right that but that's still not identifying unique machine ids or such
[02:49:26] <coruja> mort: i think you still miss the educational aspect
[02:49:57] <mort> I agree that being able to download and install aur packages manually is good
[02:49:59] <jtritz> if this conversation could be politly interupted, i'd like to ask for advise about chromium crashing my window system, should i abandon chromium? what about the other issues i've had with fluxbox, should i start trying to 'debug' them? or how should i deal with the unstable behaviors i've been having?
[02:50:26] <Namarrgon> jtritz: do you get a coredump?
[02:50:31] <demonicm1niac> i've got fluxbox running on both amd and intel on about 7 machines from different eras without issues also running chromium
[02:50:42] <cdrp> demonicm1niac: ye but it's enough to give what mort wants (not that i am arguing in favour of that, just pointing it out)
[02:51:02] <alad> jtritz: some more detail on your hardware might help
[02:51:14] <earnestly> mort: Arch provides the AUR and supports means of interacting with it.  Some users operate outside of those boundries.  The users who don't use the supported means are by definition excluded from the support of Arch
[02:51:18] <demonicm1niac> cdrp: i mean no because the amount of aur calls by helper vs no helper still doesn't tell you whether that's 2 people doing 1 million aur helper calls or 1 million

[02:53:25] <mort> cdrp: I don't really think the numbers would even be that necessary tbh, because Namarrgon/alad aren't really disagreeing about them; if I'm understanding them correctly, their argument could be written as, "even if AUR helpers are the most popular way to interact with the AUR, people who use AUR helpers are using the AUR in an unsupported way so
[02:53:25] <mort> AUR helper-specific issues shouldn't be a consideration for maintainers"
[02:53:36] <alad> demonicm1niac: auracle is pretty bad on the server load as well, e.g. buildorder makes about the same amount of requests as packages in the dependency chain
[02:53:46] <Namarrgon> mort: now you got it!
[02:53:51] <alad> demonicm1niac: e.g. for ros-foo it makes 200+ requests when 7 are sufficient

[02:55:29] <jtritz> that's just running coredumpctl
[02:55:43] <demonicm1niac> or that have the default build/dl dir in tmp and then lost on reboot :D

[02:56:27] <demonicm1niac> i don't want to know how often some people deleted/installed cmake or ninja a day
[02:56:29] <alad> remove the package or corrupt the db -> package gone
[02:56:46] <mort> I still think aur helpers are nice fwiw, I had a period where I decided to try not to use them and eventually just got annoyed having to manually update all the aur packages and having to manually do the dependency resolution
[02:56:49] <demonicm1niac> or git
[02:57:07] <jtritz> yeah, i guess, some old one's at the bottom from june 4
[02:57:35] <jtritz> i'm surpised how many entries there are, if these all indicate problems
[02:57:41] <mort> downloading pkgbuild scripts from random people on the internet *is* kind of scary, but the AUR is kind of just a fundamentally scary place and at least AUR helpers let you download and inspect packages without running any scripts
[02:57:54] <alad> mort: I wrote aurutils after having 800 aur packages in my local repo that I wanted to manage in some way. but I wouldn't expect anyone but me to support it when it goes wrong
[02:58:01] <Namarrgon> jtritz: "coredumpctl debug <pid>" should drop you into gdb with the coredump loaded
[02:58:42] <Namarrgon> jtritz: post the dmesg output from after such a crash too
[02:58:46] <demonicm1niac> weeeelllll many bad aur helpers do source pkgbuilds as shell scripts executing stuff in it to get the makedeps and stuff
[02:59:00] <mort> heh, so you essentially wrote an aur helper

[02:59:37] <alad> mort: also one thing that's often overlooked is email notifications, it doesn't scale very well but it's something
[02:59:41] <alad> demonicm1niac: at least it's fast when your package manager avoids all safety and removes any and all fsync calls

[03:00:12] <alad> as such that's what most helpers use nowadays
[03:01:01] <mort> alad: I didn't know about that. That makes sense. I just noticed that at some point in time, AUR helpers which didn't source the PKGBUILD to parse it became popular, didn't look into it further than that
[03:01:22] <alad> historically helpers had to source the pkgbuild or parse it in some way, because the dependency info wasn't available from the aur
[03:01:26] <alad> that was added around 2012 I think
[03:01:34] <earnestly> .SRCINFO didn't exist either

[04:07:13] <kstar> Is there a way to make an /etc/crypttab entry that prompts for a password with a timeout, but also allows for a headless remote bootstrap user? As cautioned in the ArchWiki, if I try to use a password prompt + nofail option, the boot process opens my display manager before I can type the password.
[04:07:27] <kstar> So I want it to sort of wait for a minute for me to enter password, and if I don't, just move on.

[04:14:41] <kstar> Heh, there's a thread on the ArchLinux forum with exactly this question, but no resolution. Two things I can think of are: 1) Write a custom systemd target that prompts for the crypt password, but if it times out, does not announce a failure so that the boot process is not stopped.
[04:15:06] <kstar> 2) Create a systemd target that comes right after this that just sleeps for the same timeout and is a hard dependency [less clean]
[04:15:09] <kstar> Any ideas?

[08:22:18] <sheep> swissknife: did you use luks 1 or 2?
[08:22:25] <swissknife> (sorry I'm new to IRC, wanted to do a newline and post the full question all at once, oh well) I checked that my UUIDs are correct, everything seems good, and after going through the relevant archwiki page (encrypting an entire system#Encrypted_boot_partition) and several others, I just can't seem to figure out what it is I'm doing wrong. I added what I think is the all relevant information to this paste https://paste.rs/RwG What am I missing?
[08:22:54] <sheep> looks like luks 1
[08:22:56] <swissknife> @sheep I used luks2 initially, then found out that grub2 has limited support, so I restarted from scratch with luks 1
[08:22:59] <swissknife> yes
[08:24:30] <sheep> is /boot on the root filesystem?
[08:25:28] <swissknife> yes, it's not a separate filesystem. It's intentional as I'd prefer to keep a single LUKS container, however I can make it into its own partition easily enough if need be
[08:25:49] <swissknife> I read something on the wiki to the effect that it shouldn't matter, let me try and find that reference again
[08:25:59] <sheep> does grub support the whirlpool hash?
[08:27:03] <swissknife> it should, I was using some other non-standard hashes earlier and grub-mkconfig was giving me errors. It has not given me errors on whirlpool. I can change luksChangeKey and try that out
[08:28:31] <sheep> it looks like it has at least some support for whirlpool
[08:28:50] <sheep> are you using a non-US keymap?
[08:29:33] <swissknife> Yes, it has a whirlpool module, and grub-mkconfig generates the grub.cfg so that it gets loaded
[08:29:55] <swissknife> standard US keymap. I tried with both laptop keyboard and external USB keyboard just in case that was the issue
[08:31:48] <sheep> did you try running grub-install again since the last time you changed your disk setup?

[10:01:00] <randomxusr> could this be systemd trying to run that check? should I replace systemd with udev in the hooks? or will that cause issues?
[10:01:43] <blinux> I've got some application with those tofu / domino fonts. Any idea what fonts I'm missing? I did an initial install of fonts to get it setup right following the wiki a while back. But, I guess that was not enough.
[10:04:22] <_cyphertite_> blinux:  If you don't have them already, give `pacman -S ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation` a try.  They look great
[10:05:44] <sheep> randomxusr: remove the systemd hook. it's not fully compatible with a lot of the not sd- hooks
[10:06:55] <randomxusr> shoot. I just added the sd-encrypt hook thinking that was my mistake
[10:07:13] <sheep> I think sd-encrypt would work but it needs different parameters
[10:07:16] <randomxusr> If I switch them both back.... to udev and encrypt, should that work?
[10:07:23] <sheep> yes

[10:10:56] <randomxusr> permission to curse?\
[10:11:45] <blinux> I think I'm using freetype and the wiki says there is no emoji fallback. It might be emoji symbol showing as thed domino character.
[10:12:08] <blinux> The package is called "freetype2"
[10:12:45] <randomxusr> sheep you are bad.  I have a working system again.  Thank you soooo much
[10:12:51] <sheep> yay
[10:13:07] <blinux> I don't think that is a correct understanding. I have pango also well which is listed below freetype.
[10:13:45] <randomxusr> sheep: how can I give back to the channel or the community?
[10:14:15] <sheep> I'm not sure, but I usually help people here
[10:14:54] <blinux> It is not the noto-fonts-emoji. I just installed that.
[10:15:16] <sheep> maybe your fontconfig isn't including those
[10:15:32] <_cyphertite_> blinux:  maybe something from https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Font_configuration will help

[10:15:42] <randomxusr> I'll try when I get the time. I'm a noob tbh, but I'm loving Arch with Luks, BTRFS, Plasma, and all the features. 
[10:16:00] <sheep> maybe add noto-fonts-cjk or some other cjk fonts

[10:17:18] <blinux> I'm using vim and have the airline plugin and at the bottom there is this strange domino character. I don't know what it is supposed to be. Thanks for the configuration page. That is a different page than the font page.
[10:17:35] <sheep> does that require powerline fonts?
[10:18:09] <blinux> Oh, I did enable powerfonts in the .vimrc which made the bars pointy.

[13:28:07] <Enrico63> Hi. I can't configure the SSH server on my computer. I did it a long time ago, via requesting and obtaining a public IP and forwarding the external ports 9022 and 9122 to my computer's local IP from the router config page. At some point, due to a hard reset of the router, the whole thing stopped working. Now when I try to set up the port forwarding
[13:28:08] <Enrico63> from the router config page, as soon as I insert 22 as the internal port (then I'd fill the other fields too), the button to accept the configurations greys out. But there's the simplified port configuration, where I can select SSH and the server device from two drop downs, and the port 2222 is forwarded to that device. However, even doing so, when
[13:28:08] <Enrico63> I go on https://canyouseeme.org/ and check the port 2222 for my public IP, I get "connection refused"
[13:28:10] <phrik> Title: Open Port Check Tool -- Verify Port Forwarding on Your Router (at canyouseeme.org)
[13:29:26] <Enrico63> I've asked the question here (https://superuser.com/questions/1662920/port-forwarding-issue-connection-refused-when-sshing-into-a-configured-port), where you can find also two screenshots of the modem config page

[13:30:09] <NetSysFire> looks more like a router problem. #networking might know

[14:40:04] <Aardwolf> Hi, since a recent update, ark, archive manager, thunar, etc... can't uncompress gz files anymore. I have core/gzip installed. This used to work. What package could I be missing?
[14:40:18] <NetSysFire> !doesntwork
[14:40:19] <phrik> What do you mean it doesn't work? If there's an error, *tell us*. If it's more than two lines, see !paste.
[14:40:25] <NetSysFire> leaty: anything in your journal?
[14:41:22] <leaty> no it remains empty after running it
[14:41:26] <Aardwolf> "doesntwork": e.g. Ark gives a red box: Loading the archive ‘file.gz’ failed with the following error: No suitable plugin found. Ark does not seem to support this file type.
[14:42:00] <leaty> or not empty, sorry, I mean nothing new appears in journal

[14:42:27] <NetSysFire> Aardwolf: anything in arks optdeps?
[14:42:47] <leaty> yeah I can still do sudo poweroff, but it used to work without root and it should right?
[14:43:47] *** Joins: killown (~killown@user/killown)
[14:43:47] <NetSysFire> you may need to be in the wheel group for that i think

[14:44:18] <phrik> Title: Allow users to shutdown - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[14:44:25] <Aardwolf> If pacman should show the optdeps when doing pacman -S ark, then it doesn't show any. However, I found the issue! The gz file was invalid! It's just a misleading error that Ark is showing, instead of showing an error "this is not a valid gz file" it says "have no plugin for this"

[18:39:13] <MacGyver> The better question is what *types* of systems are represented by pkgstats.
[18:39:22] <MacGyver> Or, more accurately, types of people.
[18:39:44] <alerque> No it's probably irrelevant because what I really wath to know is a ballback on the total Arch install base, but hey...

[21:43:14] <tatsumaru> hey guys, what does it mean to install Java LTS ? Is it the previous version?
[21:45:35] <NeverSummer> LTS is Long Term Support.  Older versions that are maintained past the point that a package would normally continue receiving updates.
[21:45:54] <NeverSummer> The newest LTS version of Java on Arch is 11, which is like... pretty old.  The active development version is 16.
[21:46:49] <tatsumaru> I am trying to install freeplane a mindmapping tool which doesn't support anything above Java 15
[21:46:51] *** Quits: H3dn1ng (~H3dn1ng@2-248-149-85-no172.tbcn.telia.com) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[21:46:59] <tatsumaru> So the advice on aur is to install Java LTS and then set 'FREEPLANE_JAVA_HOME'
[21:47:03] <NeverSummer> So no not the previous version by default.  Sometimes it's the previous version; other times the newest LTS is quite a few versions back.
[21:48:01] <NeverSummer> You can certainly do that.  It's usually a better idea to go all the way back to the latest LTS rather than running a newer unmaintained version.

[21:48:55] <tatsumaru> NeverSummer, would it be a mess for my system to have multiple java versions installed
[21:49:04] <newtoliberachat> what does it mean to see 'cp error writing <file>: File too large'
[21:49:12] <NeverSummer> I mean they conflict if you try to install them with pacman at the same time.
[21:49:17] <NeverSummer> You can install multiple versions using containers.
[21:49:26] <newtoliberachat> I am trying to copy an ISO which is 5.40GB, I have enough space on my USB
[21:50:08] <mongy> the file system you're using possibly
[21:50:26] <NeverSummer> Trying to write to FAT32 would be my first guess.
[21:51:15] <newtoliberachat> Yes the USB is in W95 FAT32 (LBA)
[21:51:17] <NeverSummer> tatsumaru, if you try to tell pacman to install jre and jre11 at the same time it's just going to tell you to screw off.  It won't do that.

[21:53:51] <tatsumaru> NeverSummer thanks for the info that sounds a bit too much maintenance for an app I will just try another mind mapping app
[21:54:05] <newtoliberachat> any suggestions on how can go about splitting the .iso into parts and joining back?
[21:54:08] *** Joins: Menzador (~quassel@user/menzador)
[21:54:28] <tatsumaru> newtoliberachat, you could just use another file system on your usb drive too
[21:54:30] <NeverSummer> I mean ISOs are just a container.
[21:54:32] <mongy> whatyearisit.jpg
[21:54:38] <NeverSummer> You can extract them like a zip.
[21:54:45] <NeverSummer> Or mount them like an optical disk.
[21:55:09] <newtoliberachat> I will give that a try
[21:55:21] <NeverSummer> 7zip will extract an ISO like it's a zip folder and the mount command will mount it to a /mnt or /media location so you can see the contents.
[21:55:23] <mongy> use a supported filesystem?
[21:55:40] <NeverSummer> Or just use exFAT like everyone else.
[21:55:54] <baltazar> newtoliberachat: there's also the split command, which does exactly what you expect. later you can cat the resulting files together
