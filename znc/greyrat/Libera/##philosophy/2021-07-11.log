[10:24:37] <lalia> Another long parenting day is steadily rolling to a close. Kiddo's in bed... time to kill a couple beers and read for a bit.
[10:24:50] <lalia> Hopefully yer all doing well. :)
[10:25:09] <arryana> heya
[10:25:12] <arryana> congrats
[10:25:36] <lalia> :3
[10:25:38] <amigojapan> Hi lalia
[10:25:42] <nalkri> It is so hot!
[10:25:49] <lalia> arryana: how's your morning?
[10:26:00] <amigojapan> Hi nalkri long time no see
[10:26:09] <lalia> amigojapan: howdy :)
[10:26:18] <nalkri> Terve, amigojapan
[10:26:28] <nalkri> The exodus has been a confusion
[10:26:42] <arryana> yesterday was a brutal day, no way around it
[10:26:46] <amigojapan> nalkri: pretty hot here in let me check the temp
[10:26:55] <arryana> my brother is trying to coerce our mother into forking over chunks of money to her
[10:27:05] <lalia> nalkri: no fun. hopefully it's not supposed to be a continual issue like the heatwave here.
[10:27:23] <arryana> my little hacker went to visit my mom on my request to bring her some groceries, and my brother was there, caught red handed trying to get her to sign stuff
[10:27:35] <amigojapan> Oh one 31c.i thought it was hotter
[10:27:35] <duckgoose> global warming is a hoax they said
[10:27:54] <arryana> as soon as he realized who had just walked in, he faked a phone call from his wife, saying he had to leave immediately and visit her in the hospital
[10:27:59] *** Quits: Metamorphosis (uid451146@user/metamorphosis) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[10:28:10] <amigojapan> duckgoose: the ones that said that are the hoax
[10:28:12] <arryana> then he sat in the parking lot and waited for my hacker to leave.  he didn't realize my hacker knows his cars and followed him back in.
[10:28:24] <arryana> at this point i'm worried my brother will just smother her with a pillow
[10:28:29] <lalia> arryana: sorry to hear it. :( familial trust issues are top-shelf terrible.
[10:28:40] <arryana> i need to call the cops on him today, i think
[10:28:42] <arryana> no matter what she wants
[10:28:43] <amigojapan> duckgoose: unfortunately it's not easy to fix
[10:29:09] <duckgoose> they say we're past the point of no return now
[10:29:16] <arryana> who is 'they'?
[10:29:23] <duckgoose> experts in the field
[10:29:32] <arryana> there are a lot of those and few agree on much
[10:29:36] <arryana> which field?
[10:29:38] <arryana> which expert?
[10:29:51] <duckgoose> global warming
[10:29:53] <duckgoose> multiple ones
[10:29:56] * arryana sighs
[10:29:57] <amigojapan> duckgoose: I think it could be fixed . If we reduced the population of earth
[10:29:58] <lalia> My favorite mainstream conspiracy is the "everything will be okay" line of reasoning.
[10:30:24] <duckgoose> reduced the population of earth?
[10:30:27] <duckgoose> you mean genocide?
[10:30:28] <lalia> Holy shit, the brazeness of it, right?
[10:30:35] <arryana> ...
[10:30:57] <amigojapan> duckgoose: well I don't like it. But I think it's the only real fix
[10:31:15] <duckgoose> https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/12/reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-stop-climate-change-study/3761882001/
[10:31:15] <arryana> manufacture is much more of a problem than the number of humans, genocide won't be necessary
[10:31:15] <ro-bot-o> [url] Climate change study: Reducing greenhouse gases won't stop warming | www.usatoday.com
[10:31:21] <arryana> that's just hysterical
[10:31:23] <lalia> :| Well, I just wanted to say hi. I probably won't stick around for this one.
[10:31:26] <amigojapan> duckgoose: we need like a population of 1 billion people
[10:31:33] <lalia> I've got some scholarship to read and beers to drink.
[10:31:34] <arryana> yeah, i don't think i will either, lalia.
[10:31:37] <arryana> but nice to see you
[10:31:42] <duckgoose> amigojapan who would decide who gets to die
[10:31:42] <nalkri> Reducing population doesn't imply genocide and isn't necessarily necessary anyway
[10:31:44] <lalia> arryana: you as well. :3
[10:31:49] * nalkri pours lalia a nice port
[10:31:55] <arryana> oooh
[10:32:02] <amigojapan> duckgoose: I would volanteer to die
[10:32:03] <lalia> Sounds lovely. Been a while.
[10:32:09] <nalkri> Well, an OK port, we can't get the good stuff here :þ
[10:32:15] <lalia> We've all volunteered to die.
[10:32:17] <lalia> It's called life.
[10:32:22] <arryana> ^
[10:32:23] <duckgoose> I wouldn't
[10:32:24] <nalkri> I didn't volunteer to live :þ
[10:32:32] <lalia> :D
[10:32:42] <lalia> Audrey would like that comment, I'd wager, nalkri. :D
[10:32:50] <lalia> +1
[10:32:50] <nalkri> You have a very Colour Sargeant view of volunteering :þ
[10:32:51] <duckgoose> you all must have some life issues going on to be so willy to die
[10:32:53] <arryana> it'll be nice to have her back
[10:33:01] <duckgoose> willing
[10:33:02] <nalkri> Have you heard from Audrey lately?
[10:33:22] <amigojapan> duckgoose: pretty sure many would if given the option. But maybe not 7/8ths of the population
[10:33:25] <arryana> i don't advise you assume so much, duckgoose
[10:33:25] <nalkri> I assume she's just busy
[10:33:29] <arryana> it's just going to make you look stupid
[10:33:34] <nalkri> You know what they say about assumption
[10:33:36] <lalia> I'm a skeptic and fond of buddhist strategies towards reconciling with life and death.
[10:33:43] <nalkri> It makes an ass of you and mption
[10:33:49] <arryana> haha
[10:33:50] <duckgoose> amigojapan whats stopping them
[10:33:57] <lalia> But also, skeptic means I'm honestly clueless and pretty good with it at this point. :D
[10:34:06] <duckgoose> you don't need permission to die
[10:34:14] <amigojapan> duckgoose: laws against painless suicide
[10:34:29] <duckgoose> there is no law against suicide
[10:34:39] <nalkri> In many regimes there are laws against suicide
[10:34:41] <amigojapan> duckgoose: society actively goes against it
[10:34:43] <duckgoose> it would be a self defeating law
[10:34:50] <duckgoose> well sure
[10:34:57] <arryana> welp, too much angst and ignorance for me.  later.
[10:35:00] <duckgoose> most people want to help suicidal people to live
[10:35:03] <nalkri> Interestingly there aren't here but the word for it literally breaks down to “self murder”
[10:35:08] <duckgoose> to overcome the things that are making them want death
[10:35:10] <lalia> Speaking of which, before I duck out... The IEP entry for ancient skepticism is honestly one I'd suggest skipping. The author really seems to have his narratives crossed.
[10:35:18] <nalkri> pussipupu: test
[10:35:39] <duckgoose> heh thats interesting
[10:35:43] <amigojapan> duckgoose: ok then we will all side global warming to the bitter end
[10:35:44] <duckgoose> saying there is too much angst
[10:35:47] <duckgoose> then rage quitting
[10:35:59] <nalkri> Not every quit is a rage quit.
[10:36:09] <duckgoose> pretty sure that one was
[10:36:18] <nalkri> Didn't look like one, maybe you're projecting :)
[10:36:23] <duckgoose> "too much x y z bye"
[10:36:33] <nalkri> Coffee's probably cooked, toodles
[10:36:33] <duckgoose> I mean maybe it's not
[10:36:42] <duckgoose> it sure isn't a normal way to part a conversation
[10:36:58] <amigojapan> duckgoose: she hates me
[10:37:12] <duckgoose> who is she and why does she hate you
[10:37:57] <duckgoose> does she hate you for your opinions on things
[10:37:58] <amigojapan> duckgoose: anytime I discuss a philosophical topic she puts me in ignore
[10:38:05] <amigojapan> Yes
[10:38:12] <lalia> Harald Thorsrud's entry is just unimpressive with his nearly unfailing tendency to filter the ancient tradition through contemporary context. As such, he's probably the first scholar who's contributed to IEP and SEP on the topic who I'd suggest everyone simply do without.
[10:38:25] <duckgoose> well
[10:38:25] <lalia> SEP has a series of much better related entries.
[10:38:34] <duckgoose> if you're not making people upset then you're not making them think
[10:38:41] <lalia> Take care gang. o/
[10:38:52] <amigojapan> Bye lalia
[10:38:59] <amigojapan> O/
[10:39:09] <amigojapan> Big head :)
[10:39:47] <amigojapan> ○ノ bigger head
[10:41:18] <amigojapan> duckgoose: so yeah. I bet at least 10 percent of people would choose to die if it was allowed and painless
[10:41:37] <amigojapan> If not more
[10:43:14] <amigojapan> duckgoose: I am for making suicided kits. That you can just buy and use
[10:43:31] <duckgoose> guns work
[10:43:55] <amigojapan> Guns are hard to come by in Japan
[10:44:27] <duckgoose> I don't think dying would be painless in any circumstance
[10:44:28] <amigojapan> duckgoose: also you can survive shooting yourself
[10:45:00] <amigojapan> duckgoose: first you go unconscious then the lethal injection is administered
[10:45:21] <duckgoose> the road to being suicidal is itself paved in pain
[10:45:38] <amigojapan> True
[10:46:31] <amigojapan> duckgoose: tho I am pretty sure this is stopping many people
[10:49:50] <spruit11> hmm,  you lived in Japan too long?
[10:50:07] <duckgoose> idk
[10:50:22] <spruit11> don't the Japanese have a suicide problem?
[10:50:36] <duckgoose> when I picture a world where you call a suicide hotline and instead of getting help you get tips on how to do it, I find that concerning
[10:52:42] <amigojapan> duckgoose: I just want kits.i don't want other people to be involved. Cause then we start with people restricting it
[10:56:12] <spruit11> kids?
[10:57:20] <duckgoose> amigojapan are you happy
[10:57:27] <duckgoose> in general
[10:58:04] <amigojapan> At the moment I am pretty happy duckgoose
[10:58:46] <duckgoose> do you believe in an afterlife?
[10:58:50] <amigojapan> spruit11: kits not kids
[10:59:17] <amigojapan> duckgoose: but sure. I will make up my mind if there is one
[10:59:33] <amigojapan> Not sure
[10:59:39] <spruit11> what kind of kits are we talking about?
[11:00:21] <duckgoose> any kit you could use to commit suicide is a kit you can use to commit murder
[11:00:38] <amigojapan> spruit11: something you can operate alone. First puts you into an unconscious state and then gives a lethal dose
[11:00:46] <spruit11> oh,  right
[11:01:17] <amigojapan> duckgoose: so are guns. Or knives
[11:04:06] <spruit11> ah well.  you do you,  I suppose
[11:04:17] <amigojapan> Even accepting the pain of suicided. Failing to suicide is a whole ordeal in modern society
[11:04:58] <duckgoose> then you have to see how many people you hurt when you attempted it
[11:05:19] <duckgoose> amigojapan ask your family how they feel about you ending your life
[11:06:02] <amigojapan> So much for freedom of choice when you can't even decide to live or die. Not even your own body is yours in this society
[11:06:21] <amigojapan> duckgoose: you are getting rather personal
[11:06:41] <duckgoose> suicidal is quite the personal thing
[11:06:50] <duckgoose> suicide *
[11:06:59] <spruit11> for the longest period it was normal for philosphers to be 'melancholic'.  used to be a common affliction which kind of came with the trade
[11:07:11] <spruit11> should look that up once
[11:07:40] <duckgoose> if you successfully commit suicide things don't end there
[11:07:55] <duckgoose> your family will have to claim your body, decide what to do with your remains
[11:07:58] <duckgoose> explain it to the kids
[11:08:37] <duckgoose> how do you tell a child their uncle committed suicide
[11:08:48] <amigojapan> duckgoose: that is their problem. If it really hurts them too much. They can use a lot too
[11:09:08] <amigojapan> Kit too
[11:09:19] <amigojapan> Maybe not a kid
[11:09:23] <duckgoose> consider it, less you be inconsiderate
[11:10:01] <amigojapan> duckgoose: not every ordeal in life requires my consideration
[11:10:32] <duckgoose> right
[11:11:18] <amigojapan> duckgoose: also, of the kit were available I would not use it right now. I just want the option to be open
[11:11:32] <amigojapan> Right now I am pretty happy
[11:11:55] <duckgoose> a person will consider a lot about their own feelings and troubles, and weather they are worth killing their self over. but they never seem to consider the impact it would have on other people
[11:12:01] <duckgoose> I think thats what you call selfishness
[11:12:47] <amigojapan> duckgoose: or the people around them are selfish to want to keep them alive whole suffering
[11:12:57] <amigojapan> While
[11:13:04] <spruit11> right,  Freud sees melancholia as a pathological reaction to a loss which mostly happened at the unconscious level
[11:13:12] <spruit11> but yah,  Freud
[11:14:11] <duckgoose> if you think it is selfishness for people to want you to live you might be confused on what love is
[11:15:07] <duckgoose> it's not about wanting someone to suffer, its about wanting someone to be happy
[11:15:12] <duckgoose> and there is no happiness in death
[11:16:21] <duckgoose> when a person commits suicide they don't have to live with it for the rest of their life, it's their friends and family that does
[11:16:36] <duckgoose> they are left forever thinking if they could've done something different
[11:16:41] <amigojapan> duckgoose: it's selfish for people to be on with me suffering constantly
[11:16:48] <duckgoose> wondering if they loved you enough
[11:17:25] <spruit11> https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/are-intelligent-people-more-melancholic/
[11:17:26] <amigojapan> Be ok*
[11:17:26] <ro-bot-o> [url] Are Intelligent People More Melancholic? -The School of Life Articles | Formerly The Book of Life | www.theschooloflife.com
[11:17:43] <duckgoose> if you are suffering then you surely can't be in a healthy mental state
[11:18:03] <duckgoose> would it be wise to send suicide kits to people in unhealthy mental states
[11:18:19] <duckgoose> they cannot think clearly, they think their emotions
[11:19:00] <amigojapan> duckgoose: I am not suggesting now tho
[11:19:24] <amigojapan> 3:48 PM <amigojapan> duckgoose: I am not suffering now tho
[11:20:13] <amigojapan> duckgoose: I just want the option to escape from suffering in the future
[11:20:52] <spruit11> nono,  there's something like the 'depressed realist' or 'realist depression'.
[11:21:07] <amigojapan> duckgoose: but you should be happy cause most people agree with you
[11:21:14] <spruit11> it's not always mental illness.  can just be realist
[11:21:30] <amigojapan> I see spruit11
[11:21:44] <duckgoose> most people agree with me on what?
[11:21:59] <duckgoose> that life is worth living?
[11:22:08] <brigand> if you decide to suicide consider that 50% of marriages fail. and that's a pretty big life decision already
[11:22:48] <amigojapan> duckgoose: that people should be stopped from suiciding
[11:27:41] <duckgoose> "All 29 people who have survived a suicide attempt by jumping off of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge have said they regretted their decision as soon as they jumped."
[11:32:59] <spruit11> hmpf,  I would consider Camus.  the guy gave suicide a lot of thought
[11:33:15] <spruit11> not sure what he thought about it again

[11:35:13] <amigojapan> duckgoose: do we have video testimony? Also how would I know it's the real people
[11:35:28] <spruit11> "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. " -- Camus.  Like I've stated here before,  too self-centered,  the real serious problem worth contemplating is cannibalism
[11:35:41] <spruit11> but let's indulge in Camus for a while
[11:36:07] <brigand> is it self-centered?
[11:37:40] <amigojapan> spruit11: rather suicided if I am forced to become a cannibal
[11:38:14] <spruit11> nono,  the question is cannibalism.  unsure the answer is yes to that
[11:38:28] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[11:38:33] <nalkri> pussipupu: test agin
[11:38:44] <spruit11> anyway,  seems Camus chose life.  but he's a bit unclear at it.

[14:59:08] <krb> hi
[15:02:24] <chatguy> hi krb can i follow u on tweeter?
[15:02:55] <krb> i don't think i have a account there
[15:04:28] <chatguy> glad to hear it
[15:04:40] <chatguy> so what have you been philosophising about in here while i was away?
[15:08:26] <brigand> suicide
[15:09:13] <krb> not sure if i could put a word to it. but i've been thinking about lately about how prayer in general is depression for example
[15:09:44] <krb> and that gods are like ideas that people waste time and effort to seek
[15:10:08] <nalkri> pussipupu: test the third/fourth
[15:10:28] <krb> why seek mysteries at all
[15:10:44] <krb> might not have much practical application
[15:10:59] <nalkri> I think I must not understand what you mean by at least one of “prayer” or “depression”
[15:11:19] <krb> the two seem to be much the same thing
[15:11:36] <nalkri> Not to me and I don't see how they could
[15:12:23] <brigand> .wt depression
[15:12:23] <ro-bot-o> [wiktionary] depression — noun: 1. (psychology) In psychotherapy and psychiatry, a state of mind producing serious, long-term lowering of enjoyment of life or inability to visualize a happy future, 2. (geography) An area that is lower in topography than its surroundings, 3. (psychology) In psychotherapy and psychiatry, a period of unhappiness or low morale which lasts longer than several weeks and may include ideation of self-inflicted injury […]
[15:13:08] <chatguy> hi brigand
[15:13:09] <krb> mysteries/myths is much a wishful drive. just to wish-think something. to pray is to call after something you just wish would be there
[15:13:28] <brigand> hi chatguy
[15:13:49] <chatguy> are you okay, brigand?
[15:14:08] <brigand> sure. you?

[15:14:32] <brigand> oh, it was amigojap*n and duckgo*se talking about suicide
[15:14:56] <chatguy> a worthwhile topic
[15:15:14] <brigand> and spru*t11 chiming in with citing Camus
[15:15:56] <chatguy> and what did Camus say? don't worry, be happy?
[15:16:18] <krb> the connection between depression and prayer is inside the brain
[15:16:30] <krb> not by the synonyms of words
[15:16:43] <brigand> this is what spru*t11 quoted "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. " -- Camus.

[15:17:57] <krb> there is other articles too that can be used as anecdotes for the explanation of the relationship between depression and prayer
[15:18:08] <krb> prayer is a pathetic act by "lowered" entities

[17:45:16] <choozy> Sometimes unfortunately telling such people that they are the scumbags and asshole's of the world and you lost all respect for them and never want to see or hear from them ever again is not putting the earnestness of the situation through their thick skulls so to say...
[17:45:16] <chatguy> well you're a nice person and he's your brother so i'm sure he must be nice too
[17:45:23] <arryana> jesus christ
[17:45:28] * arryana sets /ignore chatguy
[17:45:55] <arryana> the only thing that will get through his head that he has crossed the line is when he's sitting in a jail cell
[17:47:14] <choozy> chatguy, you don't go giving out money to someone who extorts it from other people, I don't care if you need it, you just don't do that, especially not targeted at weaker individuals, especially not on your own family
[17:48:28] <chatguy> choozy oh okay. well i hope it all works out
[17:49:51] <choozy> chatguy, I have nothing to do with this situation, this is merely my opinion in how you should act on a moral standpoint, If you have good reason for helping and defending criminals and criminal behaviour you can state your rebuttal here
[17:50:28] <chatguy> i don't really believe in morality so i don't have much to contribute
[17:50:43] <choozy> Aha, okay

[17:51:50] <lalia> arryana: I'm glad you're there for your family, even as your brother is doing damage. Your mom is lucky to have you.
[17:51:52] <lalia> <3
[17:52:10] <arryana> she did the best she could.  and nobody deserves what's happening to her
[17:52:15] <arryana> but thanks, i appreciate it
[17:52:21] <arryana> it sucks having to be the diceman
[17:54:07] <lalia> On the bright side... England might bring home the UEFA cup later today. :P
[17:54:24] <arryana> the yelling hasn't started yet
[17:54:29] <arryana> so i guess the game's not on for a while
[17:54:41] <lalia> It's a few hours off yet. ;)
[17:54:49] <arryana> there's a pub a mile or two off, it's always possible to hear the cheering from the beer garden
[17:55:25] <chatguy> shall we discuss some philosophy?
[18:00:02] <lalia> I'm still waking up and getting my morning started. I'll prep notes for a Euthydemus discussion later and work on some skepticism scholarship for a paper I'm trying to finish.
[18:00:10] <arryana> ooh
[18:00:33] <lalia> ATM, I'd prefer caffeine mostly.
[18:00:48] <lalia> I expect the match to be intense. England and Italy both have killer teams.
[18:01:04] <arryana> to be honest, i really don't follow it
[18:01:21] <arryana> i haven't seriously followed any sport since the mets canned mackey sasser for the double pump
[18:01:24] <lalia> Fair! I've only intermittently followed footie.
[18:01:38] * arryana will never forgive!
[18:01:59] <arryana> not serious, obviously, but...
[18:02:06] <lalia> :D My sports knowledge is pretty terrible TBH.
[18:02:14] <arryana> i will watch a sport if other people are watching, and i can appreciate a good play
[18:02:19] <arryana> but i don't really give a crap past that
[18:02:23] <lalia> Hulk Hogan was a famous tennis player, right?
[18:02:26] <arryana> hahah
[18:02:30] <arryana> basketball
[18:02:38] <lalia> That sounds better. :D
[18:02:47] <arryana> he was tall, right?
[18:02:49] * arryana giggles
[18:03:07] <lalia> chatguy: did you have a topic in mind? It's an open forum, after all. :)
[18:03:18] <arryana> the whole cameraderie of sports/teams just goes over my head
[18:03:38] <arryana> playing games is fun, making an identity of it...
[18:03:39] <arryana> not for me
[18:03:55] <lalia> I get to play the game I prefer later. :D
[18:04:10] <lalia> It's time to finish our deeply delayed D&D game today.
[18:04:32] <lalia> Should be the final session of this adventure... we've had to put it off for over a month.
[18:04:34] <arryana> oooh
[18:04:53] <arryana> my other half's thing like that starts in half an hour
[18:05:04] <arryana> i don't know what game it is, i don't think it's straight d^d
[18:05:13] <arryana> &
[18:05:22] <arryana> sorry, german keyboard, stuff isn't labeled as what it is
[18:06:13] <lalia> I guess the UEFA final starts at 8PM BST.
[18:06:18] <arryana> call me cheap, but this machine cost me a $1000 less in german, and i touch type anyway
[18:06:35] <lalia> A hell of a savings. :o
[18:06:40] <arryana> indeed
[18:07:34] <arryana> it might even get to do a real job, i've been considering signing up to work for test and trace here
[18:07:57] <arryana> they're begging for people, and it seems like a public service which might be worth the tie
[18:07:58] <arryana> time
[18:08:30] <lalia> I need to spend some time reviewing a recent text on the history of philosophical skepticism by a scholar who's reputation I'm only just learning about.
[18:08:41] <lalia> Skepticism in Philosophy by Lagerlund
[18:09:12] <lalia> Still not sure what to expect TBH... he's mostly known for his contributions to medieval scholarship from what I can tell.
[18:09:33] <lalia> Reading... what a chore. :D
[18:09:40] <arryana> haha
[18:09:50] <arryana> i still need to get back to the plato
[18:10:11] * arryana googles lagerlund
[18:11:11] <arryana> ooh
[18:13:07] <lalia> I'm planning to hold my first voice session to discuss Euthydemus sometime during the first week of August. Probably gonna focus on topics like the form of eristic arguments and the Plato's overall treatment of ancient sophistry in Athens. With a little luck the other regulars will be ready too: the group has had several extremely insightful contributors over the months of meeting. :)
[18:13:49] <lalia> Always happy to discuss here too. Voice sessions have been super painless over Discord.
[18:14:01] <lalia> But text works anywhere. :3
[18:14:24] <arryana> actually, i'd really like to listen in audio
[18:14:35] <arryana> maybe today i'll see about discord
[18:14:46] <arryana> if i still have any patience after dealing with the phone calls, anyway
[18:14:47] <lalia> We'll definitely be recording too.
[18:15:08] <lalia> I'll make sure I save all of these too... Not gonna risk losing all the backups this time around.
[18:15:36] <lalia> GG, unexpectedly dramatic server splits.
[18:15:46] <luminousnine> Wait... there's a #philosophy Discord server?

[18:16:22] <luminousnine> Oh i thought it was about this channel
[18:16:37] <luminousnine> I've been on some philosophy servers too
[18:16:57] <lalia> I run a server for ancient philosophy (mostly focusing on Greece because of my own background).
[18:17:06] <lalia> I guess that server is an extension of this one in a sense.
[18:17:09] <luminousnine> Ah i see
[18:17:56] <lalia> The other bigger server I hang out on is called The Philosophy Cafe. I am not part of the staff there, but I do run reading groups on that server and am friends with many regulars. :)
[18:18:07] <lalia> The reading groups have been outstanding over the past year or two.
[18:18:17] <luminousnine> Nice
[18:18:38] <arryana> ooooh, petrichor
[18:18:48] <lalia> Always happy to share invites, just lemme know.
[18:18:49] <luminousnine> I wish i was more active there but then again, i wouldn't trade it for writing
[18:19:07] <luminousnine> Which i've been doing again
[18:19:27] <luminousnine> And sure thing
[18:19:45] <lalia> I spend most of my Discord time on reading groups stuff or in a private family-type server. :)
[18:19:59] <lalia> I've loved the bioethics group and the metaphilosophy readings have been killer too.
[18:20:30] <lalia> The people running these groups are often graduates or tenure track professionals too, it's a joy to participate.
[18:20:45] <luminousnine> Very cool
[18:21:00] <lalia> I've thought so. :P Clearly I'm a fan.
[18:21:21] <luminousnine> Nothing wrong with that
[18:21:58] <luminousnine> I've been on and off computer because of thunderstorms we're getting from Sweden
[18:22:27] <luminousnine> Plus my network was down for some reason for hours, need to call in about that tomorrow
[18:23:14] <lalia> arryana: fingers crossed for your family intervention situation. <3 And hopefully you'll have ample space to relax once you've concluded.
[18:23:25] <lalia> Sweet pupper cuddles maybe. :3
[18:23:40] <lalia> Not sad chatguy left.

[21:41:15] <gb73d> I believe that any philosopher of note has something useful to say even if they are controversial politically.
[21:41:32] <gb73d> its taken me a lifetime to reach that conclusion
[21:42:16] <gb73d> Fear should not be a determining factor in choosing who to read and not read.
[21:42:53] <gb73d> Surely if I have my professed faith, reading antithetical material shouldnt take it away.
[21:43:24] <gb73d> People who think deeply and write may have pearls of wisdom.
[21:46:06] <spruit11> No idea why they place Nietzsche that much as a precursor to existentialism.
[21:49:36] <brigand> After his death, his sister Elisabeth became the curator and editor of  Nietzsche's manuscripts. She edited his unpublished writings to fit her German ultranationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating Nietzsche's stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche
