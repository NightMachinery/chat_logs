[01:02:46] <ttys000> hey guys
[01:02:49] <ttys000> i'm back
[01:03:05] <ttys000> the guy who's linode hasn't been able to email microsoft since dec 21st
[01:03:10] <ttys000> turns out... it's not just me.
[01:03:17] <ttys000> it's literally all of linode
[01:03:28] <ttys000> microsoft banned all of linode.
[01:03:50] <ttys000> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/674558/550-57511-access-denied-banned-sender.html
[01:04:20] <ttys000> so i finally gave up today, after submitting a ton of requests, and now i'm relaying all outbound email via amazon aws.
[01:04:42] <ttys000> microsoft 1. me 0.
[01:15:27] <Friithian> my linode was banned by outlook from day 1, I recently did the forward an email to them and wait until they decide to do something
[01:17:32] <superkuh> Gotta call up Microsoft and lie about having an outlook 365 account with them till you get to a tech that actually knows what a mailserver is.
[01:17:41] <superkuh> Then you can get off the blacklist.
[01:18:20] <superkuh> Er, office.
[01:18:31] <Friithian> I just sent an email to my uni account (we use m$), waited for the bounce email, followed the bounce's instructions to forward it somewhere, waited
[01:55:26] <Atque> ttys000: Umm... just use a different email address and report it to microsoft?

[03:45:59] <ttys000> lol
[03:46:06] <ttys000> Atque: have fun wiht that
[03:46:59] <ttys000> superkuh: actually tried that too. i even made an o365 account and made a ticket that way. they claim that they can't do anything about it because its a different department.
[04:37:16] <Friithian> apparently there are email to rss services. A newsletter I like comes by email and I asked about rss/atom which there are no plans for and they suggested trying an email to rss service
[04:37:24] <Friithian> seems… too convoluted

[17:32:38] <Deknos> hi, in my sent box (IMAP) with my gpg encrypted emails, why is there a DKIM failed header entry? i pay for my emailservice, is there any measure/action from my (client) side that it does not fail?

[18:12:39] <Deknos> that does not help, as with not-gpg-encrypted emails the dkim validation in my SENT box is not in the failed state
[18:54:20] <rob0> DKIM checking for submission makes no sense
[18:54:44] <rob0> obviously, submitted mail will fail SPF
[18:55:27] <rob0> I guess you could add your home IP address to your SPF, but that's silly

[22:33:08] <foo> I'm dealing with uid's from imap and processing emails individually. In the same email inbox, specifically with Gmail imap, can I reasonably assume that uid's will always be unique? I think yes, but I'm tempted to check uid and timestamp.
