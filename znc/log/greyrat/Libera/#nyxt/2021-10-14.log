[06:00:46] <hendursaga> gah, hinting in a new buffer is broken again :(
[06:22:26] <mariari> oh the build of nyxt is differnt now
[06:22:48] <mariari> jmercouris: what build system did you move to it seems you have hashes now
[06:23:52] <waleee> git submodules
[06:24:04] <mariari> nice
[06:24:10] <mariari> hopefully this makes nyxt stable for me
[06:24:23] <mariari> shame that quicklisp can't do this for you :(
[06:25:15] <mariari> I was trying to update my packages recently but update-all-dists failed to work oddly enough
[06:26:18] <waleee> ... and this in the .asd so you dont have to manually do a recursive clone or initialize them, https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/nyxt.asd#L234
[06:26:48] <mariari> oh no
[06:26:51] <mariari> QL does not exist
[06:27:02] <mariari> it seems that QL doesn't exist anymore on nyxt?
[06:27:20] <mariari> https://pomf2.lain.la/f/vmuvmnm0.png
[06:27:23] <waleee> you have to add it to the init.lisp now, jmercouris mentioned it
[06:27:54] <mariari> so load ~/.sbcl?
[06:28:27] <mariari> ahh my personal config uses ref and clashes with nyxt's
[06:28:45] <waleee> the exact quote was "like in .sbclrc"
[06:28:58] <mariari> sweet hopefully nyxt doesn't crash on me
[06:29:26] <mariari> waleee: it's ql:update-all-dists to upgrade packages right?
[06:29:32] <mariari> got really weird responses lately that makes me doubt that
[06:30:30] <waleee> I usually just do (ql:update-dist "quicklisp") since I don't have more than that one
[06:30:43] <mariari> even for quick loaded packages?
[06:30:52] <mariari> I guess all packages update at the same time?
[06:32:08] <mariari> thank you for the help waleee
[06:32:46] <waleee> mariari: I assume you mean loads in the form of (ql:quickload ...)? I thought it specifically only worked for those
[06:33:10] <mariari> I mean updating those packages
[06:33:22] <mariari> it seems you just update the dist from quicklisp itself and it updates all of those
[06:34:28] <mariari> to me that seems a bit weird, given that you may want to only update a few packages
[06:36:05] <waleee> it does the package set approach, all packages in the set should be "guaranteed" to work with each other
[06:36:28] <mariari> so almost like an LTS system, but without proper versioning protection... I see
[06:37:14] <waleee> yeah, a bit like the stackage sets in haskell-land, but less versioned
[06:40:42] <mariari> waleee: I hope nyxt being very unstable as of late was all due to package mismatches for some reason
[06:41:05] <mariari> it has been quite bad, making nyxt almost unusable
[06:41:07] <waleee> maybe
[06:41:32] <waleee> I'm experiencing a fun error of another variety atm
[06:42:05] <mariari> oh?
[06:42:44] <waleee> well, the same since clearlinux updated to webkitgtk 2.34 as the default and introduced a compability package for 2.33
[06:43:39] <waleee> mariari: one of the nyxt threads crashes on g_log when opening an url
[06:44:08] <mariari> huh.. I think I saw you mention this last week?
[06:44:19] <mariari> does it always crash when opening an url?
[06:45:13] <waleee> yep, but I had hopes it was a sbcl issue, but stassats was certain it was a webkit error
[06:45:15] <waleee> mariari: yes
[06:45:40] <mariari> I see, I've been having issues with SBCL versions myself
[06:45:46] <mariari> though I got around it stump wise
[06:46:34] <waleee> nice that it worked out
[06:46:56] <waleee> I'm not a fan of multithread debugging in gdb
[06:47:24] <mariari> I don't blame you
[06:47:35] <mariari> emacs makes it a bit more bearable but yeah...

[17:46:20] <ecraven> hey ;) does nyxt have anything like noscript, that will allow me to not run any javascript unless I explicitly allow it?
[17:46:39] <mariari> there is no-script-mode included with nyxt
[17:46:59] <mariari> you can run that, and make it a default for buffers
[17:47:15] <ecraven> thanks, I'll look into that
[17:47:17] <ecraven> how can
[17:47:31] <ecraven> I get the currently displayed URL from the shell given the PID of a running nyxt?
[17:47:36] <ecraven> would I have to connect over swank to get that?
[17:48:18] <mariari> you can actually access that directly from the repl
[17:48:26] <mariari> there is a notion of the current web page
[17:49:02] <ecraven> well, what I want to do is create a note with the currently displayed url, but without actually doing anything in the browser. so I need a way to automatically extract the current web page url from a running nyxt
[17:49:12] <hendursa1> ecraven: what shell we talking here?
[17:49:26] <ecraven> in the end, Emacs, but for now, I'd like to get this working in bash or zsh
[17:49:37] <ecraven> can I send remote "commands" to nyxt in any way?
[17:49:51] <hendursa1> you can send Lisp snippets..
[17:50:02] <mariari> NYXT-USER> (nyxt:url (nyxt:current-buffer))
[17:50:02] <ecraven> last time I tried that, I couldn't get it to actually *display* anything
[17:50:04] <mariari> #<QURI.URI.HTTP:URI-HTTPS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device>
[17:50:15] <mariari> yeah so for example this gets the url of the current web page
[17:50:45] <hendursa1> ecraven: have you looked at https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/06/29/extending-nyxt-via-emacs-how-to-leverage-common-lisp-wealth-to-get-your-links-as-qr-codes/ ?
[17:50:51] <mariari> ecraven: every command you do in nyxt is actually a function in CL!
[17:51:05] <ecraven> mariari: I know that ;)
[17:51:59] <ecraven> hendursa1: yes. this is all fine for getting more stuff working *inside* nyxt, but I want to get data *out* of nyxt automatically ;) so it seems swank/slime would be the best bet here
[17:52:31] <ecraven> would be great if this just *displayed* the value ;) ./nyxt --remote --eval '(nyxt:url (nyxt:current-buffer))'
[17:52:50] <ecraven> or even this: ./nyxt --remote --eval '(format #t "~a" (nyxt:url (nyxt:current-buffer)))'
[17:52:56] <ecraven> but stdout is not sent over this channel
[17:53:06] <mariari> you can make it send stdout
[17:53:06] <ecraven> ah, and of course that's Scheme, not CL ;)
[17:53:10] <mariari> with a bit of scripting
[17:53:19] <ecraven> that would be interesting, how?
[17:53:29] <mariari> 1 sec looking at my config as I display text directly
[17:53:46] <mariari> I believe echo 1 moment please
[17:54:16] <mariari> yeah
[17:54:19] <mariari> NYXT-USER> (echo "hi")
[17:54:23] <mariari> <INFO> [09:24:13] hi
[17:54:42] <mariari> noNYXT-USER> (echo (quri:render-uri (nyxt:url (nyxt:current-buffer))))
[17:54:44] <mariari> <INFO> [09:24:40] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device
[17:54:52] <ecraven> no luck, this produces no output: ./nyxt --remote --eval '(echo "hi")'
[17:55:05] <ecraven> (well, not in the terminal window where I run it :-/)
[17:55:15] <mariari> well if you launch nyxt and run that in it
[17:55:17] <mariari> it'll display
[17:55:21] <mariari> so what you can do is upon new pages is run a hook
[17:55:26] <mariari> that automatically calls this
[17:55:32] <hendursa1> ecraven: what do you have *socket-path* set to?

[17:58:51] <ecraven> hm.. how do I got to the repl inside nyxt?
[17:59:08] <mariari> M-x lisp-repl
[17:59:22] <mariari> or you can do start-swank (I use start-slynk) then hookup emacs if you want emacs interaction
[18:00:24] <ecraven> where does nyxt listen for swank?
[18:00:33] <mariari> 4006 by default IIRC
[18:00:38] <mariari> 127.0.0.1 port 4006
[18:00:46] <mariari> I should try https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/emacs-hacks.org one of these days
[18:01:51] <ecraven> hm.. doesn't seem to listen on any port
[18:01:58] <ecraven> it says Listening to socket "/run/user/1000/nyxt/nyxt.socket", but that's not slime, right?
[18:02:27] <mariari> that is not the slime one
[18:02:35] <mariari> what happens when you call start-swank on the first time?
[18:03:04] <mariari> you should see something like
[18:03:06] <mariari> INFO - Slynk server started at port 4006
[18:03:15] <mariari> Can go to the *messages* buffer to see past messages
[18:04:36] <ecraven> ok, *socket-path* is a socket-data-path with basename set to "nyxt.socket"
[18:05:25] <ecraven> thanks, this is nice. I'll read up on the manual and tutorial and play around with things a bit, but firefox is getting too creepy :-/
[18:05:33] <ecraven> and I've wanted to integrate nyxt in my EXWM-setup anyway ;)
[18:05:50] <mariari> Enjoy playing around with nyxt! It's a lot of fun to hack
[18:05:54] <mariari> what has firefox been doing lately?
[18:07:39] <ecraven> they add more and more phoning home.. the last one was https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/08/mozilla_adding_sponsored_search_results/ (that "Not now" is just so well hidden this cannot be attributed to coincidence)
[18:08:12] <mariari> oh boy....
[18:08:27] <ecraven> so, what I want in the end, is to drive most of nyxt from emacs. so I'd like to get a list of buffers out of nyxt, display it in emacs with auto-completion, then select one, then tell nyxt to now display this buffer.
[18:08:31] <ecraven> things like that
[18:08:37] <ecraven> I've tried this a few months ago, but got sidetracked
[18:08:57] <mariari> you should be able to do that, esp if you can bind emacs from CL
[18:09:06] <mariari> never tried having emacs automate my CL stuff, but that would be cool!
[18:09:18] <mariari> that link I sent shows some connection to emacs, so it might help(?)
[18:09:26] <ecraven> well, the main thing I'd need is to send CL forms to nyxt and have the results printed, then I can just print s-expressions, read them in emacs, and do stuff
[18:09:39] <ecraven> yea, I'll just play around
[18:09:40] <ecraven> thanks!

[20:55:33] <jmercouris> Repost for our euro friends
[20:55:36] <jmercouris> https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/sustainable-open-source.org
[20:55:45] <jmercouris> edgarvincent[m]: no worries :-)
[20:55:57] <jmercouris> You can still get a copy for free!
[20:56:54] <mariari> btw jmercouris nyxt has been stable today 0 crashes
[20:56:58] <mariari> the issues are fixed!

[21:07:08] <aadcg> I find it odd that Nyxt is financed by grants (i.e. tax-payers) and sells "applications"
[21:08:30] <aadcg> It's also odd those are EU grants but some of the employees are people from outside the EU where the life standards are significantly lower
[21:12:20] <aadcg> And I thought it was a known fact that the only way to sell free software was to charge a ridiculous ammount of money from the first copy
[21:17:47] <aadcg> Just sharing my views.  My email is public, if anyone wants to discuss them

[21:38:47] <jmercouris> mariari: nice
[21:39:15] <jmercouris> aadcg: all grant specific work is done by Pierre and myself only
[21:39:24] <jmercouris> It has to be this way for legal reasons
[21:39:36] <jmercouris> Also the company is registered in the European Union
[21:39:45] <mariari> he isn't here
[21:39:52] <jmercouris> Ah well, oh well
[21:40:32] <waleee> Aloha
[21:40:44] <jmercouris> Aloha waleee
[21:41:00] <mariari> aloha
[21:41:16] <waleee> mariari: did you see the inquiry about cl-webkit2?
[21:41:23] <mariari> yeah but I already went to sleep
[21:41:26] <mariari> do you still want that ran?
[21:41:26] <waleee> ah ok
[21:41:50] <waleee> that would be great
[21:42:15] <mariari> says T from nyxt
[21:42:19] <mariari> if you run it directly on my browser
[21:42:26] <mariari> > (asdf:test-system :cl-webkit2)
[21:42:27] <mariari> T
[21:42:33] <waleee> it fails on WebKitWebsiteDataManager for me when run from a sbcl repl
[21:43:41] <waleee> so it'd be a much easier way to replicate than having to launch nyxt and open a url
[21:44:30] <mariari> yeah I bet
[21:45:01] <jmercouris> waleee: did website data manager change between webkit versions?
[21:45:10] <jmercouris> They don’t use semver do they?
[21:46:08] <waleee> not sure. But my distro created a compability version for 2.33 / libwebkit2gtk-4.0 that seems to be picked up by nyxt, and works flawlessly for vimb
[21:47:58] <jmercouris> Hm
[21:48:18] <jmercouris> hmMmMmM
[21:48:43] <jmercouris> I’ll have to test that on my machine, it should be possible due to the magic of NiXoS
[21:49:14] <jmercouris> waleee: you could always run the Guix pack version in the interim
[21:49:41] <waleee> yeah, I downloaded it yesterday
[21:50:29] <waleee> mariari: test-system :cl-webkit2 evaled to true inside nyxt here too
