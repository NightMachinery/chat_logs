[03:11:17] <Joanna> _inky: that’s not a bad idea to have operating system keep programs from doing things by default. iOS does that . I’m not sure if there aren’t backdoors to get around the restrictions though.
[03:35:04] <Joanna> Computing is definitely based on trust and it’s really difficult to know what is in the code you are running unless you audit and compile yourself. Few people are going to do that. Then there is the hardware and os which can have bad things. At best you can reduce the number of things you use computers for whenever possible.
[04:11:18] <jan6> human society is also based on trust
[04:11:30] <jan6> it's literally impossible to have perfect security anyway

[04:14:19] <jan6> linux distro, and f-droid style "we build it ourselves" kind of repos, are the most reasonable way to go about this, unless you want to go all out gentoo, and compile everything yourself (although arch-based stuff usually has a nice middle-ground with AUR having predefined recepies, you can check are fine, and then automatically have it update packages with a helper, without needing to go and
[04:14:20] <jan6> manually download and compile each update)

[16:28:57] <Joanna> iz:  suppose if you have enough information about strangers you might be able to make better predictions of what they will do but it’s not guaranteed.
[16:28:58] *** Joins: inky_ (~inky@37.186.122.130)
[16:32:19] <Joanna> The trend I have noticed more is trusting people by their roles because of unrealistic expectations. For an example tv shows depict police as heros who will come rescue anyone in trouble and make things right.
[16:34:38] <Joanna> This fantasy doesn’t last long for people who are crime victims or attract the attention of police for any reason for that matter.

[17:30:38] <iz> well, with wisdom about the world comes the understanding that depictions in tv shows and movies often don't line up with real life
