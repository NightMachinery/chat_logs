[13:43:19] <lukego> I'm defining an electronics schematic as Lisp code. Originally I composed it using functions but now I'm tempted to switch to macros. Not because it needs them - and indeed they will be more hassle to write since I'll need to backquote all the code - but I think it might be worth it for being able to explore using macro-expand commands in emacs.
[13:43:51] <lukego> That strikes me as a different use case for macros :-) i.e. if I write it with functions then I'll need to develop tooling to inspect the final result but if I write it with macros that's kind of baked in.
[13:44:30] <lukego> I wonder if there is a better approach that combines the strengths of the two somehow but I can't think of one.
[13:44:33] <moon-child> can you not explore the function version using eval commands in emacs?
[13:46:04] <lukego> I don't /think/ so because with macros I can pick any subexpression and macroexpand that while with functions I'd need to evaluate all of its arguments and environment somehow. Maybe a command that sets a breakpoint and runs until it hits?
[13:46:45] <lukego> but macroexpand in SLIME is kind of nice because I can interactively repeatedly expand macros and gradually elaborate the parts I'm interested in
[13:49:42] <prxq> lukego: electronics schematics sound like a good fit for clos machinery...
[13:51:36] <lukego> prxq: Hm. Just now I have an abstract representation of a circuit that is CLOS heavy. That's the data structure that I plan to use for checking design rules and generating simulation data and so on. But what I'm doing now is a user-facing notation for describing a circuit.
[13:52:03] <lukego> So for example I have

[13:53:00] <lukego> (defmacro decouple (a gnd C) `(chain! ,a (capacitor ,C) ,gnd))
[13:54:07] <lukego> so that in my actual schematic definition I could write (decouple vout :ground #q(100 uF)) and be able to expand that out
[14:00:51] <lukego> maybe a better example would be defining the "feedback" network for a power supply IC to tune it onto the right voltage. (FEEDBACK-FOR #q(3.3 volts)) ==> (VOLTAGE-DIVIDER 0.42) ==> (CHAIN! VIN (RESISTOR #q(42000 ohm) FEEDBACK #q(100000 ohm) GROUND)
[14:01:33] *** Quits: unyu (~pyon@user/pyon) (Quit: WeeChat 3.1)
[14:02:00] <lukego> that example is probably wrong :-) but it's supposed to illustrate that some interesting things will be happening during macro expansion e.g. deciding what voltage division is needed to tune the power supply IC and then deciding which actually-available pair of resistors to use for that purpose.

[14:04:12] *** Joins: HDurer (~hdurer@104.132.45.86)
[14:04:56] <moon-child> ahh, I see.  That is an interesting problem
[14:05:09] <lukego> Maybe though it could work as moon-child says and e.g. use a command to single-step into (FEEDBACK-FOR #q(3.3 volts)). And maybe macros would be limiting because they will require a lot of arguments to be literals when functions would allow more flexibility.
[14:05:22] <moon-child> I would be tempted to write a pattern amtcher and run it to a fixed-point.  But maybe that's just cause I like pattern matchers
[14:05:40] <moon-child> it would certainly be more complex than just using macros
[14:09:14] <lukego> I'm also keen to hit upon a style here that could be reused in other domains too where you are basically using a higher-level notation for generating descriptive data. Today it's electronics schematics, tomorrow maybe it's RISCV assembler code, then Blender 3D models, then software dependencies, ...
[14:09:42] <moon-child> that sounds like something a pattern matcher would do well at
[14:09:54] <prxq> I would approach this by having the spec language just generate a data structure, which then can be shaken up in multiple passes....
[14:10:45] <prxq> a macro at expansion time might need global info not available just yet.
[14:11:14] <lukego> I guess that multiple passes are inevitable and maybe that detracts from the value of poking around too much in the frontend macro language. for example maybe I macroexpand to see the resistor values and then a "BOM consolidation pass" changes those to reduce the total number of different parts in the design.
[14:11:17] <lukego> yeah
[14:11:53] <lukego> and also backquoting all the function definitions to emulate normal Lisp evaluation semantics - i.e. writing macros that "were supposed to be" functions - would probably get old fast 
[14:14:51] <lukego> prxq: question then I suppose is whether the "spec language" might just be plain common lisp functions - rather than some more abstract representation that needs to be interpreted/translated - if that is the simplest way to produce the data structure.
[14:15:46] <lukego> and that's what I'm starting with e.g. (decouple! vout :ground #q(22 uF)) (pullup! en vin #q(100 kiloohm)) ...
[14:16:25] <lukego> Could always slap a more symbolic layer over that later if that feels useful, either entirely or just with a few strategic macros added in.

[15:55:43] <dim> if you're still implementing in CL then have a look at Eclector for “CST” (Concrete Syntax Tree), a reader that keeps source location info
[15:56:02] <lukego> I'm probably overthinking it though and should write a bit more code to have more stuff to mould
[15:56:09] <lukego> oh interesting
[15:56:16] <dim> otherwise I was just thinking of the call-with style (or is it with-call?) where you use a thunk argument and use that layer in the macro then

[16:27:21] <lukego> So I guess the schematic notation has two main uses. One is to define the input netlist to the board layout program. The other is to have an abstraction facility for writing the schematic in a way that makes more sense to me personally than traditional diagrams e.g. as in https://twitter.com/lukego/status/1399593597343879171

[16:53:45] <lukego> and e.g high-frequency traces would only be allowed to use vias at source/dest with no layer transitions along the way, etc. but all very hand-wave at this stage.

There's also currently gendl which is related.

[18:15:45] <gendl> Yep and dassault systemes has a thing called KnowledgeWare which is meant to do icad type stuff, but customers with experience in both still complain to this day that KW is no replacement for icad. (Gendl can be a partial replacement for icad and in some areas surpasses it — but we are fairly retarded and underfunded in the marketing/sales dept).
[18:16:56] <gendl> ParaPy (ParaPy.NL) took “inspiration” from Gendl and icad and made a shiny workalike product in Python (proprietary/closed source).
[18:17:06] <lukego> gendl: I really need to take a look at Gendl properly one day. I've taken a quick peek a few times but only get a very general sense of what it is about and don't really understand the specific use cases

[18:21:42] <gendl> if you look for info on icad, there is some disinformation out there. The Wikipedia page for both icad and knowledge based engineering seem to have been spammed with some rather bizarre and tangential content.
[18:23:14] <gendl> I have the old icad users group website on a disk somewhere with a bunch of PowerPoint presentations of typical icad apps — when/if I find that, I’ll put it online somewhere.

[18:24:24] <lukego> gendl: did you work on icad? is it lispm software?
[18:25:07] <gendl> I was never involved with icad internals — I just worked at icad customers, making applications with it.
[18:25:37] <gendl> Originally icad was on lispm then got ported to Allegro CL.
[18:26:27] <gendl> That’s why Franz has a Flavors module to this day (they created that flavors module to be able to run icad, which was heavily tied to Flavors).
[18:28:30] <lukego> amazing how many of these worlds there are within the lisp universe
[18:33:07] <lukego> gendl: must have been a pain to see it acquired and dumped by a low-end competitor :#
[18:41:13] <gendl> lukego: it was a pity, especially since the sale has been engineered by folks at Airbus to get deep integration and support between icad and Catia. That’s how it was

[22:30:28] <pjb> pl: well, if they didn't support the continuation of Concode service, it was also because it wasn't commercialy rentable to do so, be it for technical reasons, as well as politico-economic-war reasons.
[22:31:34] <pjb> pl: Airbus could have as well developped a supersonic airplane if that made economical sense.  Notice that a recent startup who wanted to develop one, bankrupted.
[22:32:13] <pjb> pl: (of course, nowadays it makes even less sense developping a supersonic airplane, when SpaceX will bring you anywhere in half an hour).
