[06:33:31] <greenbagels> [itchyjunk]: analytic continuation isn't canceling zeroes, you are defining a new function
[06:33:58] <[itchyjunk]> we've brushed over it i think
[06:34:18] <noobly> Is this a complete proof? Say f:[0,1] --> [0,1] is continuous, I must show it has a fixed point: Suppose not, then f does not intersect the line produced by f(x) = x, which contradicts the hypothesis (since the image is not fully mapped to). So f must have some fixed point f(x)=x.
[06:34:28] <[itchyjunk]> where was some trick of integrating function with holes with that 1/2pi i int_c f(z)/ (z-z_0) thingy
[06:34:32] <[itchyjunk]> i need to figure that out tomorrow
[06:35:22] <PlanckWalk> noobly: No, it's not a complete proof
[06:35:27] <[itchyjunk]> like produced by f(x) = x ?
[06:35:29] <[itchyjunk]> line*
[06:36:26] <noobly> itchyjunk: I meant to use something like 'g(x) = x', just the identity line
[06:36:58] <PlanckWalk> Nothing says that f needs to be surjective
[06:37:46] <PlanckWalk> (The result holds even if f is not surjective)
[06:38:29] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[06:38:39] <PlanckWalk> Even if f was surjective, it might not intersect that line if it wasn't continuous.  And you haven't used continuity anywhere, so the proof isn't.
[06:38:41] <isekaijin> If f is not surjective, then we have a partition of the interval into the disjoint opens {x : f(x) < x} and {x : f(x) > x}.
[06:39:22] <isekaijin> Now, 0 cannot belong to the former and 1 cannot belong to the latter.
[06:39:34] <isekaijin> So both are nonempty. But the interval is connected. Contradiction.
[06:39:47] <PlanckWalk> Yep, that's a decent topological proof.
[06:39:58] <isekaijin> ERRR
[06:40:04] <isekaijin> I meant to say “if f does not have a fixed point”.
[06:40:06] <PlanckWalk> (Once some gaps are filled)
[06:40:33] <cherim> Less fancy is g(x)=f(x)-x continuous with g(0)>=0 and g(1)<=0 so has a zero by intermediate value
[06:41:29] <frelleck> that's what is usually expected in this problem

[19:13:40] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: f can be entirely non-differentiable. Say f:[a,b] -> [a,b] is continuous. The proof just uses  g(x) = f(x) - x   (also continuous), so if g has no zero then if g(a) > 0 we also must have  g(b) > 0  by the intermediate value theorem for continuous functions. But g(b) > 0 means f(b) > b  which is impossible since f's range is inside [a,b].  Similarly, g(a) can't be < 0. So g must have a zero z after all, so f(z) = z.
[19:14:17] <Z-module> The case of f: [a,b]^n -> [a,b]^n   for higher n is way harder (but does hold for all n).

[22:11:45] <bosspotato> it's also useful outside of complex analysis
[22:11:48] <MathMagician> Here's what I've done so far: G(k) = 21(10 + k)/[(k + 1)(k+2)]. G(1.1i) = 21(10+1.1i)/[(1.1i + 1)(1.1i + 2)] = (210+23.1i)/[0.79+3.3i]. I would like to find the absolute magnitude of (210+23.1i)/[0.79+3.3i]
[22:12:23] <bosspotato> for example, if f: R^2->R satisfies the poisson equation, if you pick a point x, then the average value of f on any circle centered at x will be equal to f(x)
[22:12:40] <bosspotato> this generalizes to any R^n of course
[22:12:53] <johnkeats6> that's for harmonic functions
[22:12:55] <bosspotato> uh I meant laplace's equation there
[22:12:57] <bosspotato> yeah

[22:14:48] <MathMagician> Ah, I believe I've found the solution: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3174973/absolute-value-of-complex-fraction
[22:15:00] <[itchyjunk]> johnkeats6, oh right
[22:15:15] <MathMagician> tolarz, thanks!
[22:15:31] * [itchyjunk] curses integration
[22:16:01] <johnkeats6> [itchyjunk], also, integrals of holomorphic functions over closed loops (with no singularities inside) are 0, not the area of the loop. so there's no holomorphic function with that property
[22:16:14] <johnkeats6> there are differential forms with such property though
[22:16:31] <johnkeats6> like xdy
[22:16:53] <schillingklaus> gauss-bonnet on surfaces is a mixture of several integrations
[22:16:58] <W> [itchyjunk], it helps that differentiation is different in the complex plane, also being complex; then you can imagine the shifts in the value between two fixed points on a curve being the same even if you shift the part of the curve between the points, because it still ends up in the same place
[22:17:14] <B11529> 3 draws out of 14 games so far. game is fucking ruined.
[22:17:24] <W> just small steps in a plane, the complex points being where it goes from and where it goes to
[22:19:57] <W> (I'm probably badly explaining my own incomplete intuition here, sorry)
[22:21:28] <MathMagician> One more thing. I'm an engineering undergraduate student, but I would like to learn about the fourth dimension (from a Maths perspective, rather than Physics). Is there a good introductory book?
[22:21:38] <rain3> is anyone aware of an intuitive/geometric representation of derived proportions ?  such as the ones at page 37 http://fs.unm.edu/MyHighSchoolMathNotebook1.pdf

[22:43:31] <rain3> I don't think it would be cumbersome because the point of proportions is that they have the same ratio , just somehow represent the essence of the rule without writing duplicate formulas with both + -       *   /  as they often do in the lessons . just write a single form that encapsulates the relationship well
[22:44:42] <rain3> the distinct situations are not many I think ; one form for each situation  , if it works with addition it will work with subtraction too so no need to write/draw the one with the minus

[22:46:10] <[itchyjunk]> then i can apply cauchy formula
[22:46:21] <[itchyjunk]> the integral = f(z) * 2 pi i right?
[22:47:55] <[itchyjunk]> something isn't right though :s

[23:08:51] <riv> 2. a.
[23:09:02] <riv> there is a simple pole of order 1 at i pi / 2
[23:09:15] <riv> this is inside the contour C
[23:09:53] <[itchyjunk]> there is a pole at i pi/2 agreed
[23:10:10] <riv> so by cauchys integral formual, the integral = 2 pi i f(i pi / 2)
[23:10:32] <riv> = 2 pi i e^(-i pi / 2)
[23:10:35] <[itchyjunk]> hmm i got int = 2 pi i * f(z)
[23:10:43] <[itchyjunk]> but i couldn't get past that
[23:10:50] <riv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_integral_formula
[23:11:03] <riv> Cauchy's integral formula:   f(a) = 1/(2 pi i) int_C f(z)/(z - a) dz
[23:11:12] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[23:11:16] <riv> so I used this:  2 pi i f(a) = int_C f(z)/(z - a) dz
[23:11:18] <riv> to evalute the integral
[23:11:29] <[itchyjunk]> oh its f(a) =
[23:11:31] <riv> the integral just happens to be in that exact form
[23:11:33] <[itchyjunk]> not f(z)..
[23:11:35] <[itchyjunk]> omg
[23:11:47] <riv> yes
[23:11:47] <[itchyjunk]> a = i pi /2 right right
[23:11:58] <riv> conceptually, int_C f(z) dz = 0
[23:12:03] <[itchyjunk]> we use z_0 and z and i miswrote z_0 as z because of sloppyness
[23:12:05] <riv> by cauchys theorem
[23:12:07] <[itchyjunk]> right
[23:12:22] <riv> but int_C f(z)/(z-a) dz =/= 0 because of the pole
[23:12:40] <riv> it turns out that the only thing that matters for the value of the integral is the value of f(a)
[23:12:45] <riv> just that single point

[23:14:56] <[itchyjunk]> hm e^(-ipi/2) = cos(pi/2) - i sin(pi/2) = -i ?
[23:15:13] <[itchyjunk]> but 1/e^(ipi/2) = 1/i
[23:15:18] <[itchyjunk]> so my first one is incorrect ..
[23:17:43] <[itchyjunk]> e^(it) = cos(t) + i sin(t) so e^i(-t) = cos(-t) + i sin(-t) = cos(t) - i sin(t) ? .. cos is even and sin is odd function

[23:18:13] <riv> you dont have to work hard for everything
[23:18:18] <riv> = -i
[23:19:15] <[itchyjunk]> ah..
[23:20:05] <riv> I could figure it out by thinking about a circle and stuff, but why think
[23:20:29] <[itchyjunk]> this worked because there is one hole right? what if i had more than one
[23:20:35] <riv> a pole
[23:21:14] <riv> if there are two poles, a contour integral containing them both is basically the same as two contours that meet, one around each pole
[23:21:33] <riv> so you just add f(a) and f(b)
[23:21:53] <[itchyjunk]> that makes sense
