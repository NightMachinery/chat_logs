[02:47:17] <klardotsh> depends on your workload. anything you want to run needs to be built for arm64 which is a bit problematic in the Docker space, but otherwise, Debian/Ubuntu/Alpine/etc. ship their entire repos (to the extent possible) with arm64 support, and the instances are bonkers fast for the price
[02:47:41] *** Quits: lkhrs (~lkhrs@216-82-198-199.dyn.grandenetworks.net) (Client Quit)
[02:47:55] <bsandro> yeah i'm working on stabilizing the build for the arm64 (it will be regular ubuntu20.04lts though I think)
[02:48:25] <bsandro> not too shabby for 10+ years old project with a ton of dependencies, including some decrepit go modules
[02:48:27] <klardotsh> I've moved some of the work fleet from t3a to t4g, and aside from a bunch of Terraform hackery to make our configs know how to switch between them (and at the time, enforce regionality - eu-west-3 didn't have Grav2 support til this month), it was a non-event

[02:49:39] <bsandro> i'm no sysadmin/devops, just regular pleb developer, so don't know much about aws nodes anyway

[02:50:29] <bsandro> they won't be orchestrated instances for now, hope grav2 can live with that, don't know specifics
[02:50:41] <bsandro> i think it is possible to rent them as "regular" servers right?
[02:51:29] <klardotsh> oh totally, you can fire them up in the GUI if you want. I'll say that for a while they weren't... the most reliable things in us-west-2, I had a few fall over due o random ACPI shutdown events (not OOM, not app code), but those days seem to be behind us now
[02:51:59] <bsandro> oh, there is no need in gui, plain old ssh will suffice
[02:52:10] <c355e3b> I've noticed that you can get bit really hard on certain c lib upgrades with gravaton
[02:52:34] <c355e3b> (same issue on ppc/s390; SIMD + vector extension are non standard)
[02:52:39] <klardotsh> ah. well, anyway, they work like the rest of the standard ec2 fleet and not like the mac1.metal instances or other dedicated host instances that have all the strings attached. t4g is fine to just fire up and shell in, discard whenever you want.
[02:53:05] <bsandro> thank you
[02:53:39] <bsandro> our 'sister' project went all fancy and ported to k8s
[02:54:05] <bsandro> hope we'll outplay them at least on platform field :D
[02:54:48] <klardotsh> I like k8s when it Just Works and I don't have to think about it, it solves its problem space "well". I hate configuring, maintaining, upgrading, or hearing about k8s tho.
[02:55:01] <c355e3b> I am not a fan on developing things for k8s
[02:55:10] <c355e3b> It is soul sucking, and RedHat is 90% of the issues
[02:55:55] <bsandro> is there any sane alternative for managing that kind of containerized things?
[02:56:30] <c355e3b> IMO Nomad does a really good job, but its not really popularized
[02:56:32] <klardotsh> bsandro: docker swarm, nomad, or a few shell scripts can get you varying degrees of the way there. it depends what all you want to do, and what you outsource outside the cluster
[02:56:41] <c355e3b> and the enterprise features are waaay too much money
[02:57:09] <c355e3b> Also, do you *really* need containers or do you need a better political process for getting hosts rebuilt in predictable fashions
[02:57:11] <c355e3b> ?
[02:57:55] <bsandro> guess I need controllable (or automatic) horizontal scaling
[02:58:15] <c355e3b> If you are in AWS, that's a feature of ec2
[02:58:50] <bsandro> yeah, but I still have to make spawning nodes be aware of each other basically
[02:58:56] <klardotsh> oh, terraform up an Auto Scaling Group in EC2, have the userdata (cloud-init for most distros) pull whatever you need on boot, *or* bake AMIs in CI and have the TF deployment set the ASG to use those AMIs
[02:59:02] <bsandro> they're not 100% equal

[02:59:57] <c355e3b> The three best kept secrets in AWS are cost explorer, athena and ssm
[03:01:01] <klardotsh> bsandro: think of SSM as a giant IAM-integrated (so you can control access on a per-service or per-node basis) environment variable store
[03:01:13] <klardotsh> bsandro: integrates with kms to encrypt stuff as needed too
[03:01:15] <c355e3b> It also does remote hands tasks
[03:01:26] <c355e3b> and you can use it for SSH access if you need to do soc2/pci/iso

[04:10:21] <msmith12[m]> Qemu works great on linux
[04:10:22] <msmith12[m]> Windows maybe
[04:10:36] <msmith12[m]> Waste of time on mac in my experience
[04:10:39] <gwozniak> I'm trying qemu out right now (on Windows) and it's incredibly slow.  I probably don't have it configured right, and given how opaque the docs are, I doubt I'll be able to fix that
[04:10:43] <msmith12[m]> Whenever im on linux, i use qemu or vmware without question
[04:10:46] <msmith12[m]> Qemu comes with my distro as well
[04:11:01] <gwozniak> vmware works just fine
[04:11:09] <msmith12[m]> Personally having followed qemu development (a little bit) i think the win and mac ports are not that great
[04:11:24] <msmith12[m]> But on linux its the best
[04:11:32] <gwozniak> I can see that
[04:11:33] <msmith12[m]> Reminds me of how QuickJS still doesnt compile on Windows
[04:12:05] <msmith12[m]> When my friend tried qemu on his mac it didnt even work

[04:14:05] <technomancy> I remember once when I installed virtualbox and it was like "hey I'm going to create a ~/Virtualbox directory without asking you first hope you're cool with that" and I was like https://p.hagelb.org/nope-badger.gif
[04:14:53] <msmith12[m]> You know what i hate most about software? Automatic updates where you dont even know when something updates while making it hard to turn that feature off (Chrome does this)
[04:15:02] <msmith12[m]> Its one of the reasons why i switched to Ungoogled Chromium
[04:15:04] <msmith12[m]> I decide when i want to update my software
[04:15:20] <msmith12[m]> ios also does this
[04:15:55] <technomancy> chromium is the only program I've used where I pulled in an update from debian stable security fixes and it removed a feature I was using
[04:16:16] <technomancy> (because they refuse to do long-term support and there are sooooo many CVEs that downstream can't do it)
[04:16:54] <technomancy> on the bright side it made me ask myself what the hell I was doing using chromium and switch to a better browser
[04:17:01] <technomancy> so in the end it was a net win

[04:25:43] <indigo> Got a link?
[04:26:48] <msmith12[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/lqibnh/empress_there_and_back_again/ is a good summary
[04:26:51] <mockturtle> [ r/CrackWatch - EMPRESS: There and Back Again ] - www.reddit.com
[04:28:09] <indigo> Huh. I think I must follow a different reverse engineering community haha
[04:28:27] <msmith12[m]> it depends
[04:28:32] <msmith12[m]> Reverse eningeering can be very big
[04:28:43] <msmith12[m]> Usually to reverse engineer something, you also need to have background in topic itself
[04:28:58] <msmith12[m]> For example, if you are reversing cryptographic software, background in crypto is needed
[04:29:05] <msmith12[m]> And applies for video codecs, graphics data, etc...

[13:17:09] <enterprisey> I'm gonna do something slightly gauche and ask for an opinion in here on a disagreement I'm having in another channel: this is about how a chat client should sort the channels. I want the user to be able to choose between putting the most-recently-active channels at the top (mobile chat app style) and alphabetical sorting, and someone else wants the most-recently-active sorting and no option to change it, linking me to the old chestnut
[13:17:09] <enterprisey> https://ometer.com/preferences.html by way of explanation
[13:17:10] <mockturtle> [ Choosing our Preferences ] - ometer.com
[13:17:48] <enterprisey> ...although this is (primarily) an IRC channel, so you all are presumably used to alphabetical sorting everywhere, biasing the sample?
[13:18:29] <Irenes> oh uh
[13:18:50] <Irenes> I micromanage everything, I put my channels in a specific order manually based on what they mean to me, which often correlates with how many years I've been in them
[13:19:09] <Summer> you can have both, but it takes more work
[13:19:12] <Irenes> I don't think there's a "should" exactly
[13:19:14] <Irenes> yeah
[13:19:26] <Irenes> and the more configurability there is, the more potential for user confusion, as that essay says
[13:19:39] <Summer> imo to win in all situations: do the second, have a plugin system that has an api for channel positioning
[13:19:49] <Irenes> ... but I like that tradeoff. I'm not a typical user. I'm not a typical anything.
[13:20:13] <Irenes> yeah that seems reasonable
[13:20:44] <Summer> for hexchat, the channels are sorted, however they also have / commands to move the channels around
[13:21:03] <Summer> and in turn plugins can use the commands to achieve what they want with regards to order
[13:23:20] <enterprisey> I never knew you could move them in hexchat, and I've been using it for five years
[13:23:40] <EdwardIII> argument resolved?
[13:23:46] <Summer> ctrl+shift+pageup/down
[13:23:49] <enterprisey> but yeah, it turns out, as is all too frequent in software, that we'd better do the simple thing because a big complex change is in the pipeline (matrix spaces - it's a matrix client)
[13:23:54] <enterprisey> oh, like firefox!
[13:24:37] <Irenes> oh uh, as far as actually choosing between those two sort options I think it depends on kind of what mode-of-thought users prefer to be in, but that's a really fuzzy concept that I may be too tired to convey
[13:24:48] <enterprisey> I use that all the time, and then - with the tab in focus, which you can do with ctrl-L and a variable number of shift-tabs - ctrl-shift-home/end to send the tab all the way
[13:24:49] <Summer> matrix community thingers 2.0 - room edition
[13:25:05] <Irenes> like having a fixed sense of "place" vs having a river of stuff that's always changing
[13:25:20] <enterprisey> oh, for sure, I see what you're saying
[13:25:21] <Irenes> but I'd expect it to be a fairly minor effect
[13:25:26] <Irenes> oh good
[13:25:38] <enterprisey> alas, I shall have to put up with activity-sorted rooms for a while yet
[13:25:42] * Irenes nod
[13:25:49] <Summer> what I do is I demand the channels I'm in to name themselves close to other channels that are similar, so none of this is a problem for me
[13:25:50] <enterprisey> better than the current behavior - random shuffling at random intervals!
[13:26:03] <Irenes> haha, yes
[13:26:03] <enterprisey> as I said in their channel, I've just gotten very used to scanning the channel list over and over while dogfooding
[13:26:23] <enterprisey> wikipedia's great at that, summer - wikipedia-en, wikipedia-en-help, wikipedia-en-admins
[13:27:21] <lep> just give me a hotkey to jump to next active channel
[13:28:25] <enterprisey> oh how I miss hexchat's alt-backtick on matrix - I only had learned about it a few months before I switched (using matrix as a bouncer is just too good)

[13:39:26] <EdwardIII> enterprisey: what motivated you to make a matrix client?
[13:40:21] <enterprisey> well, the freenode debacle got me thinking about matrix again for the first time in a while, so when they brought the libera bridge up, I switched over and found it quite a pleasant experience
[13:40:55] <enterprisey> when I found out one of the desktop clients was in Rust, I figured I'd help out
[13:41:02] <EdwardIII> ah ha that's cool
[13:41:38] <enterprisey> I haven't contributed much, but it's fun because I know Rust decently well and it's a small enough project that I can mostly figure out what's going on

[14:00:08] <chancee1> enterprisey: will you have a method of searching channels? If so, one list to rule them all is ok. If not, consider a stateful sorting (i.e. any action not opening a channel post sort resets the state)

[14:02:35] <epilys> good morning
[14:02:37] <epilys> hey enterprisey
[14:02:50] <fedorafan> is there an overview of matrix channels and activity
[14:04:26] <enterprisey> sup
[14:05:11] <enterprisey> and chancee1, yes, we'll have a search - what would the default sorting order be with a stateful sorting?

[14:06:04] <chancee1> enterprisey: I think you'd be fighting an awful lot of momentum in email/imessage/slack for having activity (unread) first
[14:06:28] <enterprisey> funny thing is, I've only ever used desktop (IRC) chat clients that go alphabetically
[14:06:30] <fedorafan> btw i found out matrix 4 will be released this year :D

[19:51:41] <JordiGH> If I can't install software with apt, I get very suspicious.
[19:51:51] <iDrougge> JordiGH: To answer your question regarding what problem Insomnia solves, it lets you browse the API documentation, issue a templated request to the endpoints documented, and save your requests for re-use.
[19:52:23] <JordiGH> iDrougge: I don't get it, this all seems pointlessly simple compared to the actual problem of making those requests do something.
[19:52:29] <steenuil> these things are useful, I dunno about you but I'd rather have a list of things I can click through with examples rather than some text file and a couple of curl examples that I need to copy and paste to some terminal
[19:52:41] <iDrougge> JordiGH: It makes the requests for you.
[19:52:42] <JordiGH> I need a server to actually process the request and decide what data to manipulate from that request. That seems like the real problem.
[19:52:44] <Brekkjern> If you're working with GraphQL I have found Altair to be a decent replacement for Postman
[19:52:50] <steenuil> JordiGH, are you building the APIs for somebody?
[19:53:00] <steenuil> or is it just you?
[19:53:41] <JordiGH> I am building it for someone but why is documentation this whole other thing that has like three or four competing things? Isn't the real problem of building an API making something that actually does something with the requests?
[19:53:56] <iDrougge> I can't speak for Insomnia, but in the case of Stoplight, it can generate a mock server based on OpenAPI documentation. It makes quick iteration easy and you can involve both front and back end in making the spec.
[19:54:10] <JordiGH> I mean, I think I need Django REST Framework. That also has a WUI.

[19:54:53] <indigo> Ugh, Swagger
[19:54:56] <Brekkjern> Documenting REST APIs is difficult because the consumer usually can't just inspect the code to figure out how to interact with it. There's no way for them to just import something into their project and get definitions to work with
[19:55:07] <indigo> Back at my last company, we could never keep our Swagger docs up to date
[19:55:11] <Brekkjern> That's why there are so many tools to do it
[19:55:25] <iDrougge> Speaking of OpenAPI, does anyone know if there's a way to document that an ID in one object/endpoint is an ID for another object/endpoint, like a foreign key in a database?

[19:55:44] <indigo> That's the nice thing about gRPC, actually... your schema file is your documentation
[19:55:50] <JordiGH> steenuil: So that seems like just the client, right? I still need to get an insomnia binary blob to do the design part?
[19:56:17] <steenuil> JordiGH, not really, you can write it in a yaml file, it's pretty readable even without the binary blob
[19:56:28] <iDrougge> At my current project, the backend people is using their OpenAPI specification to make sure that they don't drift in their implementation.
[19:56:49] <steenuil> I usually just write the openapi file by hand and then import it into one of these tools to try the API
[19:57:29] <steenuil> yeah, it is useful so you have a clear specification of the API that both the backend and frontend people can refer to
[19:57:51] <iDrougge> They also want us to generate client code based on the spec, but generated code makes me a little sick.
[19:58:03] <Brekkjern> Have you heard of our lord and saviour, GraphQL?
[19:58:20] <iDrougge> Seems like it has peaked.
[19:58:39] <badtuple> One of these days I'm gonna see a service that actually makes sense as GraphQL and uses it well for it's purpose.
[19:58:45] <badtuple> But that day has not yet arrived.
[19:59:05] <Brekkjern> I am liking it a lot. Especially as the docs are so available in the framework I use
[19:59:12] <iDrougge> I think it's probably good as a fallback in environments where the backend people are slow to implement new needs.
[19:59:14] <steenuil> I was under the impression that graphql is good for when you have an API that lets you browse lots of interconnected resources, but most of what I do is just RPC
[19:59:47] <steenuil> I haven't used it much though, that's just what it felt like when I used it
[19:59:52] <Brekkjern>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:59:57] <JordiGH> Okay, so I got some reading to do.
[20:00:20] <badtuple> we ended up using it on a service because the lead _really_ wanted to play with it. But it was too simple of a service to warrant it, and it added a ton of complexity and lead to AWS lock-in which caused a ton of perf issues. :(
[20:00:33] <JordiGH> I need to figure out what OpenAPI is and what software I can use to generate the format and then what software I can use to turn that format into a webpage my client can click through so that my client can know what http verbsm and urls to send me.
[20:00:48] <badtuple> I like the concept in theory...but I hate the crazy tooling and have a bad taste in my mouth from that previous project.
