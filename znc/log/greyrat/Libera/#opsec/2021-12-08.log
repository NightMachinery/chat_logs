[11:52:11] <Joanna> That’s kind of ironic that you have to social engineer you way into a job :) they are excluding competent people who aren’t experts at social engineering and bullshitting. Not a wise choice in my opinion.
[11:53:34] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@5.77.152.146)
[11:56:49] <Joanna> There are additional pitfalls of job seeking such as recruitment spam. That’s really insidious the way recruiters try to insert themselves between employers and people who need jobs. I know someone who was being bombarded with spam email and cold calls and I finally told him to make a website and only respond to people who entered their contact info into the web form and passed the captcha.
[11:58:12] <Joanna> I guess recruiters scrape linked in or wherever he had posted his resume and details.
[12:00:21] <Joanna> It’s a really good idea to only use alias email address for public things in case you need to dump it because of out of control spam

[20:14:50] *** v- is now known as vaio
[20:16:44] <jessicara> Joanna: it depends on the system, there's been numerous security issues over decades with phone systems of various kinds
[20:18:57] <jessicara> apparently it's not even illegal the spoofing itself too
[20:19:04] <jessicara> it's more what do with it which might be
[20:26:47] *** Joins: tangy (~tangy@user/tangy)
[20:29:25] <iz> also basically if VOIP calls are allowed, spoofed calls are allowed
[20:29:59] <iz> it's pretty trivial to modify voip software to just change the number the call is coming from
[20:31:08] <iz> back when voicemail was dumber, i had a friend who set up a hacked astrisk voip pbx, so you could call it and have it call a cellphone from its own number, so it just lets you into thier voicemail
[20:53:12] <s1gyn> Yeah it's done via voip or some isdn thingy
[20:53:28] <jan6> afaik, the mobile phone system itself doesn't rely on the "phone numbers", those are just guidelines for lookup (e.g. "I want to call $number, it starts with this country's code, so I won't even try to look it up in my internal database"), so unsurprisingly, it can be fooled...similarly VoIP can use usernames, or numbers, or whatever, which just tell it the same stuff, where to go in order to ask
[20:53:29] <jan6> for connection to X
[20:54:24] <s1gyn> I believe for billing and 800 number phone systems they have an entirely different system that cannot be spoofed.
[20:54:46] <jan6> there's some sort of system that can basically force-push contact names or such, too
[20:54:48] <s1gyn> So if you try to spoof your number and call a toll free number, it won't work
[20:55:20] <jan6> so even if you've never been in contact with X company, they can SMS you, and it'll show up as X company, and not random numbers
[20:55:35] <jan6> might also work with calls, idk
[20:56:27] <jan6> I believe fixing the systems to disallow faking of numbers wouldn't actually be too hard, but I'd assume there's a reason they haven't done that
[20:59:18] <jan6> even if nothing else, you could have an inter-telecom agreement to let each other look up "is number X currently calling number Y", with specified-number requests only
[21:00:35] <jan6> so even if they got hacked and leaked access to that, they wouldn't be able to just see every call connection, they'd need to specifically query an X-Y connection, and if they try to bruteforce, that should set off alarm bells
[21:02:40] <s1gyn> I don't know specifics, but it is only possible to spoof if you have a special kind of connection with the phone system, not just a regular POTS line. And some of these entiies provide services that can in one way or another be used to spoof. And there are some legitimate and less legitimate reasons to do so.
[21:02:53] <jan6> that, too
[21:03:13] <s1gyn> The most benign I can think of is a business with lots of outgoing lines but only one incoming line they want customers to use.
[21:03:57] <jan6> or the reverse
[21:04:29] <s1gyn> And also debt collectors, cops, PIs etc might want to fool people
[21:04:52] *** Joins: kveroneau (kveroneau@node1.veroneau.net)
[21:04:59] <jan6> I'm not sure if PIs actually have any more rights to anything, than normal people?
[21:05:43] <s1gyn> Well normal people can spoof caller ID too. And if they are just fooling someone to get some information that doesn't run them afoul of any laws it would probably be legal.
[21:08:16] <jan6> if you pretended to be someone else who's an existing entity, which I assume pretty much most non-business spoofs would be, then that'd be "technically illegal" pretty sure... but then again, arguably using unprotected wifi can also be counted "technically illegal", so as long as you're not worth a hunt to anyone, it's prolly fine
[21:10:25] <s1gyn> Eh I am not a lawyer, but I think it depends on what you do with the information. 
[21:10:29] <s1gyn> Let me think of an example
[21:10:54] <jan6> lmao, I'm now imagining some crafty kid figuring out how to buy a spoofing service, and then getting someone sounding adult enough to pretend to be their parent and call to school explaining how they're supposedly sick, and selling that as a service to other kids
[21:12:46] <s1gyn> Lets say you are a PI for an insurence company paying for someone who claims they got a massive back injury at work. But they suspect they are faking it. If you knew they were in say a rec soccer club you could call up some numbers you could find for that and pretend to be an old friend who wants to play a game with them and ask when they usually show up.
