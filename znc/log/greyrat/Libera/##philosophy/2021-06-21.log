[01:19:57] <audrey> >> Mac has ONLY 21 out of the Top 50 games working [...] We already know that Linux has become a much better platform than “native Mac”, but the gap is now very wide and will keep increasing going forward while Mac is pretty much stuck in the dust
[01:21:39] <kmh> take that apple
[01:22:06] <audrey> So Linux is leapfrogging Macintosh
[01:22:27] <audrey> That, plus the exorbiant costs of owning an Apple computer these days ... Why does anyone run it??
[01:23:26] <spruit11> I just switched to Mac again because of the M1 and I am a sucker for hardware
[01:23:58] <spruit11> Don't think 'normal' people should though,  depends
[01:24:44] <audrey> I mean if you're rich and can blow money, be my guest

[01:26:24] <spruit11> I ran Linux far 25 year now.  But sometimes I cheat with a Mac when they leapfrog hardware.  They did it again.
[01:28:00] <spruit11> Last times I ran Linux on 1st an Air and then a Pro though.  Also blew both of them up because I think Linux didn't really handle that hardware right.  Probably overheated.

[01:30:42] <spruit11> Incredibly nice really expensive hardware this M1.  But to awkward with peripherals.  You end up spending another few hundred bucks.
[01:30:51] <audrey> Q: Any plans for macOS support?
[01:30:53] <audrey> While Wine and Proton work on macOS, there are no plans to support the new Steam Play functionality on macOS at the moment.
[01:30:54] <audrey> Cold.
[01:32:13] <spruit11> I don't think so.  Problem is that this M1 is a new complex processor Linux will need to learn to support.  Not even sure there's a public spec.
[01:33:11] <spruit11> You can get something running,  of course.  But I have doubts whether they will figure out how to handle all the components on the M1 right.
[01:33:48] <kmh> shitty hardware though
[01:33:53] <spruit11> I they don't get that right,  this thing will consume way more energy and overheat again.  (If that's possible,  it never really gets more than hand warm)
[01:34:02] <spruit11> *If
[01:34:09] <kmh> it shouldn'be just to the OS whether the hardware overheats
[01:35:10] <spruit11> I don't know.  I expect you need rather tight integration between OS and chip for newer low-power hardware.

[06:15:04] <spruit11> I took the surprising conclusion that these people were wearing a uniform themselves.
[06:15:15] <lalia> I've been listening to old Descendants, Lagwagon and Cherry Poppin Daddies albums recently.

[06:16:01] <lalia> You've made your idiosyncracies pretty claer.
[06:16:30] <spruit11> Went  to the squats in purple leggings or tuxedos.  Just to drive down a point.

[07:52:48] <lalia> spruit11: That's nice. You're talking about what promoters traditionally refered to as massive-scale dance parties which arguably began with festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival taking cues from other large-scale concert events like Lollapalooza or other jam band shows like oldschool Burning Man.
[07:53:19] <lalia> That sort of thing is not what I grew up calling a rave: that's more of an actual concert.
[07:53:41] <lalia> Raves were characterized by the underground nature of the event to begin with, IMO.
[07:53:47] <spruit11> Depends how you trace lineage.  Goa/psytrance is really old.

[07:54:15] <lalia> I can't imagine what you mean, yo. I'm familiar with the lineage of raves and dance parties. :P
[07:54:30] <lalia> They trace back through disco events.
[07:55:32] <spruit11> Hippies doing disco?
[07:56:15] <lalia> Those are jam events, disco parties are earlier and a source for funk as well as the instrumental precursors to electronic composition.
[07:57:01] <lalia> We're talking about dance events taking cues from events back in the late 50s.

[07:59:44] <lalia> Not trying to shit on your perspective, but I'm an academic researcher and I've spent years obsessing over stuff like this. I forget a lot but I'm pretty passionate about music, so I can dig up a ton of information from experience. :)

[08:02:03] <spruit11> Burningman kind-of fits.  Same subculture.
[08:02:25] <spruit11> Electric Daisy doesn't I think.  Goa is older than that.
[08:04:59] <lalia> Can't be sure what you care about, TBH. You seem motivated to take pejorative stances on uncontroversial perspectives and your thing about Goa doesn't have legs without getting ultra obscure about where it comes from and what counts as part of the musical history. It's a confusing perspective filled with historical vagueness that I can't be sure how to clarify.
[08:05:25] <lalia> I don't even know what texts I'd turn to that'd give your stance credence.
[08:05:37] <lalia> Would you suggest sources for your perspective?
[08:06:11] <spruit11> Nah.  It's just popular folkflore from the scene.
[08:06:25] <lalia> Gotcha. I'm gonna just disagee.
[08:06:40] <spruit11> I wasn't there.  Doubt you can even find it.
[08:08:09] <lalia> That's not how I work. If I can't back a stance with the veracity of research-based evidence then I take pains to avoid having a stance at all.
[08:08:33] <lalia> There doesn't seem to be a reliable case for speculating in this way.
[08:08:34] <spruit11> It's pretty okay-ish described on the Wikipedia page.  The early experiments are older.  And people from the scene like to think Goa predates House.
[08:10:52] <lalia> Fair enough.

[08:12:25] <spruit11> Not what I am suggesting.
[08:13:01] <lalia> It won't wind up being the earliest branch either, not unless it's concurrently the earliest with several other root systems.
[08:13:23] <lalia> This tree grows like a banyan.
[08:13:31] <lalia> That is: it has multiple root sources.
[08:13:51] <spruit11> Sure,  Philip Glass is in there somewhere too.
[08:14:15] <lalia> He's had nice work. :) I enjoy his style.
[08:14:58] <lalia> I saw Astral Projection in the mid-nineties, that was probably the best goa set I've caught.
[08:15:07] <Parf> that would be fuckin awesome
[08:15:49] <spruit11> These were communal hippies experimenting.  They new Glass and reich.  The scene is just old.
