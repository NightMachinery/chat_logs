[00:00:03] <kuudes> eyes?
[00:00:18] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: he's backpeddling furiously when it comes to *whose* backyards to build in and rapidly narrowing down. he could give lipservice to building more, but even then, when the rubber hit the road...
[00:00:29] <gwern> thus all the mention of 'downzoning'
[00:00:36] <adiabatic> kuudes: N95, not N100
[00:00:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I see, I see
[00:00:47] <kuudes> could be, but eyes are still a vector
[00:00:56] <kuudes> and that seems to me larger than filtered airways
[00:01:02] <gwern> 'forget it Jake. it's sftown'
[00:01:10] <kuudes> were they three dosed?
[00:01:26] <adiabatic> yesd
[00:01:27] <adiabatic> yes*
[00:01:47] <rmmh> tri-doloski
[00:03:04] <kuudes> :-/
[00:03:17] <kuudes> yeah, it only offers little protection against infection
[00:03:39] <kuudes> 5-6 doses would seem possibly to be where the protection is
[00:03:52] <kuudes> also btw https://twitter.com/sailorrooscout/status/1486704036665507847
[00:03:54] <Robomot> Chise 🧬🧫🦠💉 (@sailorrooscout): "So, not COVID-19 related, however, this is really exciting news I wanted to share. The first participant has been dosed in the Phase I study of Moderna's HIV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1644, which uses the same mRNA technology as our COVID-19 vaccines!"
[00:04:00] <kuudes> thanks covid
[00:04:21] <rmmh> yaaay
[00:04:59] <rmmh> > Results released earlier this year from a Phase 1 clinical trial showed that 97% of participants who received the vaccine showed the desired immune response!
[00:06:09] <kuudes> if only we would get to situation where we can trust that the custom vax made the day before yesterday is generally safe, we could indeed shoot out most infections ever
[00:06:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is good news
[00:07:06] <kuudes> ie when anyone gets ill in any means, lets just sample the person, find out what is the virus (2 days), design new vaccine (2 days), mint the vaccine for the small batch of the person and all of their contacts (3 days)
[00:07:09] <rmmh> kuudes: the fact that they didn't accelerate vaccine trials is abominable
[00:07:22] <kuudes> and kill every damn infectious disease from humans
[00:08:10] <kuudes> by moving immune system computation out of the biosphere to technosphere human biome could just dominate all viruses it encounters.
[00:08:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the future, those Wuhan gain-of-function researchers will be heroes!
[00:08:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> If not for them...!
[00:08:51] <kuudes> if not for mengel, we would not know how fast person dies to drowning in cold water... O_o :-p
[00:08:53] <gwern> posterity will vindicate them
[00:08:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Precisely
[00:09:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Anyway, yes, and then instead of having to rely on evolved biology to protect us, we'll rely on good old reliable designed software!
[00:09:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wait a minute
[00:09:28] <kuudes> ^_^;
[00:09:56] <gwern> (good old reliable charlie brown! how I hate him!)
[00:10:04] <kuudes> soon: "the newest batch of vaccine has an open eval() which allows user input to be executed inside everyone's cells"
[00:10:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol but also: :(
[00:11:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, Scott links https://arnoldkling.substack.com/p/some-health-economics-for-scott-alexander in his latest thread, which is a mercifully short read
[00:11:31] <Robomot> Some Health Economics for Scott Alexander, 1/23 (He bought the wrong book)
[00:11:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but it also makes no goddamn sense
[00:12:09] <kuudes> if it is crap, good that it is short?
[00:12:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> First:
[00:12:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The main reason that we spend more on health care than other countries is that we make more use of expensive procedures. Compare the per capita usage of colonoscopies in the U.S. with Canada.
[00:12:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those additional colonoscopies don’t move the needle a perceptible amount when it comes to average life expectancy. They do move the needle on our national health care budget."
[00:12:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but how does that explain diabetics having to pay triple-digit dollar sums for insulin???
[00:13:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think "can I get insulin to treat my diabetes" might just "move the needle" on life expectancy, maybe!
[00:13:24] <ggreer> because the government limits who can make insulin
[00:13:46] <ggreer> also there are many different kinds of insulin
[00:13:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Yes, right, but that hasn't anything to do with "oh we do unnecessary procedures because we're so rich lol"
[00:14:49] <rmmh> the US healthcare system is fractally bad. this serves as defense in depth, since you can't point at a single thing to change that will fix the brokenness.
[00:14:51] <kuudes> usa does not restrict gmos, was it? could some kind soul make some vegetable that grows insulin, and then give that to people so that they can grow insulin at their homes?
[00:15:18] <kuudes> or yeast?
[00:16:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, second, Kling says:
[00:16:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The reason that we spend more on health care is not higher prices. Yes, if you compare doctor salaries in the U.S. to doctor salaries in another country, we pay more. But that can mostly be explained by how much richer we are than other countries, so salaries have to adjust upward accordingly. If we paid doctors a Norwegian doctor’s salary, you would not want your kid to grow up to become a doctor."
[00:17:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Median doctor salary in Norway - https://www.salaryexpert.com/salary/job/doctor/norway - is 1 812 273 kr which is ~$200k
[00:17:41] <Robomot> Doctor Salary Norway - SalaryExpert (The average doctor salary in Norway is kr 1 812 273 or an equivalent hourly rate of kr 871. Salary estimates based on salary survey data collected directly from employers and anonymous employees in Norway)
[00:18:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the U.S., $209k
[00:18:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> So
[00:18:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Myth busted, claim debunked, etc.
[00:18:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Conclusion: Arnold Kling is full of shit
[00:18:45] <kuudes> thanks
[00:23:10] <saturn2> kuudes: well you can still get insulin the old fashioned way, by squeezing an animal's pancreas. the hard part is purifying and measuring it
[00:23:48] <kuudes> yeah. I was thinking on if someone could make a thing that would produce you insulin at home
[00:24:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile. I forget if I asked this before, but: does anyone know how I make cron put cronjob output in a log file(s) instead of sending by mail
[00:24:48] <gwern> (you did ask but no one answered iirc)
[00:26:00] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: use a shell redirect
[00:26:10] <saturn2> or a program like logger
[00:28:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> hm k thx
[00:30:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Will >> create a file if it doesn't exist
[00:30:19] <rmmh> yes
[00:30:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> k thx
[00:30:30] <rmmh> it's equivalent to the fopen 'a' mode
[00:30:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> ah
[00:31:08] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: >>/path/to/logfile 2>&1 # so you get stderr as well as stdout
[00:31:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: yep just googled that part, thx though
[00:31:35] <mst> also might need an '|| true' on the end so the rat bastard doesn't detect non-zero exit codes and send you empty email anyway
[00:31:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> uh
[00:31:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok now that I don't get
[00:32:05] <mst> remember shell processes exit zero for success and non-zero on error
[00:32:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> hm
[00:32:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this applies to scripts?
[00:32:24] <mst> your cron implementation may use that as a signal for whether to send an error
[00:32:35] <mst> welcome to unix. here's your banjo.
[00:32:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[00:32:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright thx
[00:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> We'll see if that happens I guess
[00:33:11] <mst> sure, don't overcomplicate it unless that actually happens, it just seemed worth mentioning pre-emptively while I was here and remembering how much I hate software
[00:33:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[00:33:51] <gwern> it's just sand we've duped into doing math, computers never asked for any of this ;_;
[00:34:13] <rmmh> dev life "fucking hell, my own code is serving me a coinbase preroll ad on twitch right now. i feel so betrayed"
[00:34:16] <mst> there's a reason my twitter screen name currently includes 'cursed sand herder'
[00:34:28] <saturn2> you can just put true at the end of your script, too
[00:34:39] <mst> or 'exit 0'
[00:34:46] <saturn2> yeah
[00:34:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst, saturn2: I gotta say, this strongly reminds me of "defensive semicolon" -_-
[00:35:14] <mst> but I often do the stdout/err wrapping in the crontab entry rather than the script itself, because then (a) that catches everything (b) when I look back at the crontab file later I don't have to ask myself if I remembered to do it in the script
[00:35:20] <feep> well, it`s only because bash by default *ignores errors in commands*
[00:35:23] <feep> and just keeps the script rolling
[00:35:41] <feep> and so if the last statement happens to be something that fails, your script will be considered failed
[00:35:44] <saturn2> eh, having an explicit return code isn't terribly defensive
[00:35:55] <mst> feep: it's ok, Obormot\Arcturus's a PHP dev, we're just making sure he knows how to write @ in bash
[00:35:55] <feep> that`s not the issue
[00:35:59] <spxtr> set -e
[00:36:03] <feep> the issue is that errors *only matter at the end*.
[00:36:06] <spxtr> also pipefail and -u
[00:36:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: ... lol'd IRL
[00:36:31] <feep> set -euxo pipefail
[00:36:34] <mst> \o/
[00:36:57] <feep> drop the x when you`ve confirmed your script works
[00:36:57] <spxtr> x can be very annoying, but okay
[00:37:10] <mst> feep: this is about the point where I break out a perl shebang line and p3rl.org/autodie
[00:37:12] <Robomot> autodie - Replace functions with ones that succeed or die with lexical scope - Perldoc Browser
[00:37:42] <mst> though this is not an endorsement of perl so much as an anti-endorsement of my competency at non-trivial bash
[00:38:08] <adiabatic> is that like suffixing every line with "or die"
[00:39:28] <mst> pretty much, yeah, except somebody did it for me and made a decent chunk of effort to make the error messages useful
[00:39:36] <adiabatic> neat
[00:40:06] <mst> then for shelling out you add IPC::System::Simple and/or Capture::Tiny
[00:40:18] <mst> or if you're feeling slightly more clever, IPC::Run3 plus Path::Tiny
[00:40:59] <mst> note: anything involved here that isn't core -is- known to be compatible with App::FatPacker so delivering a single standalone script is pretty easy for all permutations of those options
[00:41:49] <mst> (which also means you can transparently do all of these things master-slave over ssh using Object::Remote)
[00:43:43] <mst> so e.g. (trivial example, obviously silly but illustrative) 'ssh user@host pwd' can also be written as: perl -MObject::Remote -MPath::Tiny -E 'say +Path::Tiny->new::on(q{user@host})->cwd'
[00:47:42] <mst> adiabatic: note if you ever wonder about stuff like this, feel free to either poke me or my #perl channel on here, helping people get shit done quickly -and- robustly is invariably something that makes us all happy
[00:48:23] <adiabatic> mst: I think the last time I touched Perl was to port things from Automator to whatever new shit (emphasis on "shit") Apple is moving us to with Shortcuts
[00:49:10] <mst> oh, sure, not trying to evangelise, just trying to make sure if you find yourself with a problem perl would work for you'd end up with actually -good- perl
[00:49:32] <adiabatic> the trouble is, the new shit actually works better in Javascript
[00:49:59] <adiabatic> so instead of a five-line while (<>) {} loop I've got something similar in JS
[00:51:40] <mst> given a fleet of already existing systems that already have a /usr/bin/perl but probably don't have a global node VM, Object::Remote is hard to beat for 'zero filesystem writes involved inventory' type work
[00:52:10] <adiabatic> This is _probably_ better for future forwardness because Apple's going to stop shipping /usr/bin/perl Any Day Now, but I still don't like it, even though I kind of like JS
[00:52:36] <mst> I do have an idea for a more generalised form that if I get it write will be able to bootstrap itself given pretty much any perl/python/ruby binary in $PATH
[00:52:50] <mst> I imagine for being able to ssh in to an apple box and do the equivalent I'll have to get more clever
[00:53:02] <mst> but my target is generally "new customer's production servers"
[00:53:02] <adiabatic> you'll have zsh
[00:54:29] <saturn2> can't you just write a shellcode that loads perl over ssh and jumps to it
[00:54:29] <adiabatic> I'd be partially mollified if they included /usr/bin/swift, but I haven't been able to get simple Swift programs to read external files not part of a bundle
[00:54:56] <adiabatic> shot down my dreams of being able to save santa with Swift in Advent of Code
[00:55:56] <mst> saturn2: what I'm planning is honestly not far from being a moral equivalent of that
[00:56:15] <adiabatic> now I'm beginning to wonder how Ansible _really_ works.
[00:56:22] <mst> I already have code that will allow me to ship perl/XS modules over the wire
[00:56:29] <mst> uses memfd and some dlopen tricks
[00:56:36] <mst> so if I have two machines running the same OS
[00:56:45] <mst> and one has a completely vanilla perl core install
[00:56:57] <mst> I can still run e.g. DBD::SQLite on the far side over ssh
[00:57:04] <saturn2> neat
[00:57:29] <mst> obviously it's preferable to never find yourself in a situation where that would be useful in the first place
[00:57:46] <mst> but once you already are, well, you do the best you can with what you have :D
[00:59:08] <mst> adiabatic: oh gods I looked into that, it basically either just runs a shell command directly or ships a python script into a tempfile and executes that in place
[01:00:01] <mst> adiabatic: my code OTOH starts with 'ssh user@host perl -', squirts a bootstrap payload over the wire, and provides a full half object plus protocol style layer so you can (with lots of limitations, inevitably) manipulate local and remote objects transparently
[01:00:31] <mst> adiabatic: any time the far side tries to load a perl module, if it can't be satisfied locally, it sends a request back to the server you started on for that source code as a fallback
[01:01:09] <Robomot> [Less Wrong [frontpage]] A little game theory on discursive conflict by David Hugh-Jones - https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/MHKDGEFgrqaHSKonE/a-little-game-theory-on-discursive-conflict
[01:01:14] <mst> hence why -I- can rely on any non-core perl module that's pure perl (currently - oh, hey, guess why I've been dicking around with shipping .so files)

[01:01:25] <mst> but ansible mostly requires remote python code to be core-only

[01:02:59] <mst> adiabatic: too many people were already too busy going 'ewww, perl' by the time I wrote this stuff for it to've caught on no matter what I did, but it's an excellent ops consultant's secret weapon for doing complicated shit really fast with zero filesystem access required
[01:04:04] <mst> saturn2: my eventual plan is, inevitably, going to be having a handful of static binaries available and some sort of chain loader script I can run on the far side to get it exec'ed after I squirt it over the wire
[01:06:54] <adiabatic> mst: neat. I ran screaming from the camel book when the author went into, like, three different ways to do OO
[01:07:16] <adiabatic> but the camel book is ancient history by now, and I'd probably go from /usr/local/bin/fish into /usr/local/bin/python3
[01:08:20] <adiabatic> I tried Janet (some lisp) briefly but that was all pain and no gain for something I'd use Python for
[01:10:07] <mst> and anyway, every approach to OO described in that book was obsoleted by me and some friends over 15 years ago :D
[01:11:44] <mst> adiabatic: I am more likely to port my crawling horrors to ES6 than I am to python because ES6 doesn't argue as much when I ask for more rope
[01:12:21] <catern> gwern: that's true, that's why heroes need to be dead
[01:12:36] <mst> I already know how I'm going to solve the whole class of problems for -me- but it involves going the long way around

In case you're interested, you can find my mugshot here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-falk-0254891a2/ Over the last few months, Google’s ranking system has been extremely volatile. We’ve seen multiple
[02:52:00] <feepbot> core algorithm updates that have altered the search landscape drastically. In an effort to better understand the full impact of these updates, our SEO team has been monitoring top sites from across the internet. Unfortunately, in our analysis, we noticed that gwern.net was one of the hardest hit during this period, and we estimate that your site has lost 5.13% of its organic
[02:52:00] <feepbot> traffic since the middle of September. The volatility appears to be settling some, but the bad news is that your traffic has continued to decline in the months since the update. This means unless you address the specific cause of the issue, you are most likely going to experience further ranking drops in the near future. We’ve noticed a big red flag on gwern.net that is

[02:52:05] <feepbot> definitely contributing to this drop. In our analysis, we found that your site had significantly lower backlink strength than your competitors, 88.89% lower to be exact. In other words, despite having a lot of referring domains, the strength of your links is very low.' <-- *gasp*. I'm ruined! RUINED

[09:43:00] <zeroc00l0> saturn2: What definitions are you using for "modern art" and "shitposting"?  My brain sort of just sees your comment as, "Things I don't like are like things I don't like" or "Ugly things have ugliness in common with ugly things".
[09:49:09] <feep[work]> amusing discovery
[09:49:25] <feep[work]> when a game has dead in the name, it usually has zombies, ie. *un*dead.
[09:49:29] <feep[work]> this is a tragic naming error.
[09:49:36] <Obormot_\Arcturu> zeroc00l0: The category is "performative non-aesthetically-appealing nonsense"
[09:49:54] <feep[work]> dead island = undead island, deadspace = undeadspace
[09:50:00] <feep[work]> left 4 undead
[09:50:06] <PapuaHardyNet> dead space wasa very good game

[09:50:38] *** Obormot_\Arcturu is now known as Obormot\Arcturus
[09:50:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> So
[09:50:41] <PapuaHardyNet> what the hell happened to obormot's nick
[09:51:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aella needs Scott to post her dating profile so she can get dates? Is that the idea here?
[09:51:15] <saturn2> zeroc00l0: the thing they have in common is performative lack of effort
[09:51:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Aella hails from the internet circa 2010, in a way that few women I’ve met do. She’s a scholar of the deep internet lore; she’s a member of the rationality community" ... IS SHE REALLY
[09:52:05] <PapuaHardyNet> question: doesn't she already get more dates than she can deal with?
[09:52:25] <feep[work]> p sure if you run surveys with more than four questions you're a rationalist by default
[09:52:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Many people in this day and age are struggling with their own nature one way or another. Aella, by contrast, strikes me as deeply at peace with herself, in a manner that’s tricky to describe. You don’t have to manage her ego. She’s not seeking validation from you." ... ok, well, given that one LW post of hers, we actually know very well that this is 100% a lie
[09:52:40] <feep[work]> not sure if twitter polls qualify but it's at least on the spectrum
[09:53:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> The more I learn about Aella lately, the less I like her
[09:53:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did she really *have to* get into "the rationalist community"
[09:53:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Was that necessary
[09:53:57] <PapuaHardyNet> wow, that's a list of rationalist big names: nate soares, and aella
[09:54:17] <feep[work]> aella is cool tho
[09:54:25] <zeroc00l0> saturn2: Performative is about the maker's intent? I'm doing this because I want people to see me (do this). Or is it that you will not classify something as modern art or a shitpost until it has the social spectacle?

[09:54:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> yeah
[09:54:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is
[09:54:57] <feep[work]> what is it?
[09:55:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Read the LW post and find out
[09:55:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh wait you did read it, didn't you
[09:55:15] <feep[work]> I'm not sure it's onscreen for me
[09:55:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then you should know
[09:55:37] <saturn2> a LW post about being cool?
[09:55:38] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: wait, which post?
[09:55:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: No the one by Aella
[09:55:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know the one
[09:55:54] <saturn2> oh
[09:56:04] <feep[work]> guys I have basically no episodic memory
[09:56:08] <feep[work]> somebody remind me?
[09:56:21] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I have no idea what is going on either
[09:56:31] <saturn2> https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/bQ6zpf6buWgP939ov/frame-control
[09:56:35] <Robomot> Frame Control | LessWrong (Crossposted from my blog When I mention my dad’s abuse, I mention salient things - physical pain, insults, and controlling behavior. These are “clearly bad” - if I tell you that he often told me I was lazy and would fail horribly at life once I left home, you know it's bad, because it’s concrete, easy to imagine and obviously unkind. But this wasn’t the worst of the abuse; …)
[09:56:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[09:56:37] <feep[work]> ah shit, that
[09:56:37] <feep[work]> yeah
[09:56:44] <feep[work]> fair enough
[09:58:18] <PapuaHardyNet> okay the article is huge. any tldr as to why she is not a rat?
[09:58:44] <feep[work]> she is definitely a rat
[09:59:13] <PapuaHardyNet> feep, you know what I mean :<
[09:59:23] <feep[work]> ... yes? I was answering in the obvious sense
[09:59:35] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, why does obormot not like her
[09:59:36] <saturn2> "obvious"
[09:59:39] <feep[work]> I mean, I find the frame control article very worrying, but I honestly can't say it's offbrand
[10:00:41] <feep[work]> I think if I were to guess at obormot's objection, it'd fall into a cluster of "weak-willed people externalizing the cost of policing their inputs"
[10:00:59] <saturn2> i do wonder how much of her rat-ness is a sales gimmick for her
[10:01:13] <feep[work]> I mean, I think that's a valid reason to have rat-ness
[10:02:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course it's a sales gimmick and of course it's *not* a valid reason even slightly
[10:03:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's in fact a horrible reason and she should be shunned for it, and for everything else
[10:03:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway
[10:03:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> I also notice Alyssa Vance is on this dating profile links list
[10:03:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have met her and she seemed nice
[10:05:45] <zeroc00l0> Is calling her nice descriptive of her, or your feelings about her?
[10:06:34] <feep[work]> anything you say is in first order descriptive of your opinions
[10:06:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Um
[10:06:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of her, I think
[10:07:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> This was several years ago, to be clear
[10:07:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe she's not nice anymore!
[10:07:32] <feep[work]> maybe she is now ... HITLER
[10:07:42] <feep[work]> it was a sudden transformation that nobody predicted
[10:08:11] <feep[work]> and not even any better at painting!
[10:08:15] <zeroc00l0> I suppose the difference I was trying to point out is like, "I saw her talking to many different people who smiled and seemed comfortable while talking to her" and "When I look at her or talk to her I have pleasant feelings."
[10:08:23] <feep[work]> thas fair
[10:09:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, I see
[10:09:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I meant the first thing, yeah
[10:09:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> More or less, I don't know if I would've phrased it in that exact way
[10:09:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah
[10:14:22] <phill> Aella used to be in pickup artist chat rooms that I was in
[10:14:52] <phill> (The term "Frame control" literally comes from them)
[10:16:06] <phill> Like see here: https://krauserpua.com/2011/11/29/the-semiotics-of-frame-control/

[10:17:14] <PapuaHardyNet> phill: how instrumentally useful is Krauser's writings anyway
[10:17:22] <spxtr> aella was at seattle's rationality reading group every week for years. seems pretty likely she's a rat
[10:17:52] <zeroc00l0> "Frame is the implicit set of assumptions and expectations used to interpret a social situation."  Interpretation in this sense is an act of inference?
[10:18:34] <phill> No idea PapuaHardyNet, I just found it in Google... the websites I remember are probably long gone
[10:20:01] <zeroc00l0> "The ability to impose your preferred assumptions and expectations onto the situation is your frame control."  Talks about imposition rather than inference.
[10:20:40] <feep[work]> yes
[10:20:46] <feep[work]> your frame control => their frame
[10:21:14] <feep[work]> actually, this is a pretty useful reminder of how much cognition is physically externalized
[10:22:26] <feep[work]> hm, that'd actually be a pretty cool part of a "social training course"

[12:06:39] <feep[work]> right but even so, you're not generally dealing with direct syscalls but library calls, giving options for state corruption
[12:06:58] <saturn2> either the call aborts with EAGAIN or the signal waits until it's finished
[12:08:42] <feep[work]> and I mean, from posix's perspective it doesn't know or care what a syscall is, so it just gives a list of must-be-safe calls

[13:51:29] <kuudes> capisce, imo no because still it seems most people won't get infected from omicron
[13:51:37] <kuudes> there is a media push for such sure
[13:53:20] <kuudes> synthmeat, huh, apple turnover is now over 1000 bn$/y?
[13:53:52] <kuudes> capisce, there is currently push for not allowing people to get more than 3 vaccine doses though
[13:54:23] <synthmeat> yeah
[13:56:15] <capisce> I guess it depends on how social someone is, i.e. how many people they typically interact with in their daily life
[13:57:29] <capisce> "- Many people now have a fairly recent refresher dose and very good protection against serious illness. For them, it is better to be infected now than later, writes the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in an updated risk assessment of the omicron variant."

[13:57:36] <Robomot> Korona, Covid-19 | FHI: Bedre for fullvaksinerte å bli smittet nå enn senere (Omikronvarianten gir mindre risiko for alvorlig sykdom, og for fullvaksinerte er det bedre å bli smittet nå enn på et senere tidspunkt, skriver FHI.)
[13:58:04] <capisce> "– Vi anslår basert på scenarier fra modellering, at vinterbølgen vil kunne smitte tre-fire millioner mennesker, hvorav tolv-tretten tusen må på sykehus. Jo lenger tiltak beholdes, jo lenger varer epidemien, sier direktør i FHI, Camilla Stoltenberg."
[13:58:17] <capisce> "- We estimate based on scenarios from modeling, that the winter wave could infect three to four million people, of which twelve to thirteen thousand must be hospitalized. The longer the measures are retained, the longer the epidemic lasts, says director of FHI, Camilla Stoltenberg."
[13:58:34] <capisce> Norway's population is 5.38 million
[13:59:16] <capisce> "Strong slowdown in the epidemic postpones the problem; it is in the long run difficult to avoid becoming infected."
[14:02:20] <synthmeat> i even tried to get it a week ago. nuthin'. i spent hours with that baby!
[14:03:53] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps you did get it but your immune system kicked it out fast enough that you didn't notice
[14:03:59] <PapuaHardyNet> just like common cold
[14:05:28] <synthmeat> test would still show it though? in principle.
[14:05:37] <kuudes> how dare those people to try to avoid getting ill!
[14:05:52] <kuudes> synthmeat, omicron does not show on home tests in the first 2 days
[14:06:29] <synthmeat> yeah, i tested like 5 days later. just the cheapo ag though
[14:07:19] <kuudes> if you have got vaccinated with three doses, your protection against infection is about 2/3
[14:07:29] <PapuaHardyNet> is that probability
[14:07:43] <kuudes> yes
[14:07:51] <synthmeat> no vax tho
[14:08:03] <kuudes> well, probability for infection with three doses is 1/3 compared to unvaxxed
[14:08:14] <kuudes> have you got many past infections synthmeat?
[14:08:31] <kuudes> why no vax btw?
[14:08:33] <synthmeat> nope, none. i only ever did ag tests
[14:08:56] <synthmeat> dunno really. i just don't care.
[14:09:00] <kuudes> hmm, sounds that you likely have a good immune system? any allergies?
[14:09:06] *** Joins: d6e (~d6e@2604:880:a:6::a97)
[14:09:20] <kuudes> come on, take it. it is about the most cyberpunk vaccine we have so far
[14:09:54] <synthmeat> just a very slight duck feather and poplar allergies (barely showed up on tests)
[14:09:56] <kuudes> and if we can get to the point where we can trust to the vaccines better, with mrna vaccines we could maybe just eradicate all infections
[14:10:13] <kuudes> nice, sounds that you are healthy :D
[14:10:25] <kuudes> donate sperm? :D
[14:10:37] <synthmeat> my post-rationalization is to wait for virus evolution to at least stabilize and take the vax that's tuned for that
[14:12:20] <synthmeat> (no clue is that even sensible strategy)
[14:12:41] <kuudes> to me that does not sound optimal, but at this point it is mostly about personal protection, so I don't know
[14:12:59] <kuudes> plenty of people die or get injured though
[14:13:20] <synthmeat> i am behaving carefully though, all the time
[14:13:24] <kuudes> and it seems even offhit vaccines protect well against dying or getting disability
[14:13:59] <kuudes> and there seems to be no reason to not to take additional doses but that they would want not to pay or something O_o
[14:15:49] <kuudes> I got my other kid her third dose today, which is a personal relief
[14:16:13] <kuudes> planning to get her and her sister the omicron dose in march or whenever they will allow it for kids
[14:16:48] <synthmeat> this baby shrugged it off real fast. extreme temperature for few hours one night, then stabilized almost completely next day.
[14:16:50] <kuudes> otherwise everyone in my near family has now 4 doses
[14:17:02] <kuudes> good
[14:17:15] <synthmeat> we're half-half over here, so it's tense :D
[14:17:23] <kuudes> oh?
[14:18:11] <kuudes> what do you mean?
[14:18:42] <synthmeat> yeah, preggo sis convinced parents and hubbie to get vaxed as not to endanger her. but she/me/bro didn't take anything. we're the "rogan" crew :D
[14:18:54] <mjr> have wondered about it possibly being good to get infected at this time (semi-freshly boosted) myself. Not gonna go out of my way about it but going to be a bit more social though.

[14:19:46] <kuudes> yeah
[14:20:02] <kuudes> we have been isolating to home in fear that omicron was going to topple the system
[14:20:21] <kuudes> now that kids have got vax and peak soon is passed, we will return to more normal
[14:20:57] <mjr> but kid's now been to his bilingual class entrance exams healthy, which was a priority for me, so eh. He does wear ffp2 at school tho.
[14:20:57] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[14:21:17] <kuudes> that makes sense, mjr
[14:21:40] <kuudes> synthmeat, from personal experience if you want best protection, I recommend moderna, if you want best ux, I recommend pfizer
[14:21:48] <kuudes> moderna is stronger, but seems also kick harder
[14:22:05] <mjr> (And is as vaxxed as a healthy 12 yr is gonna be at this time.)
[14:22:38] <kuudes> yeah. 12 year olds got their vaxes in what, was it october?
[14:23:15] <mjr> Around that time. Probably optimal omicron protection is starting to wane.
[14:23:59] <mjr> I'm not overly worried for his long-term health though, what with being young, healthy, and still the vaxes should give some T-cell protection
[14:24:30] <kuudes> yeah, that seems reasonable
[14:25:22] <kuudes> personally, I want maximum safe amount of vaccines for me and my kids, but it is a personal choice if we are not going to herd immunity
[14:25:46] <capisce> what's the maximum safe amount?
[14:26:24] <kuudes> so far there has not been found a cap where it would start to be especially unhealthy
[14:26:52] <kuudes> but they only allow 2 doses for under 18 and 3 doses for over 18 and 4 doses for autoimmune patients
[14:26:54] <mjr> We probably wouldn't mind boosting the kid but aren't sufficiently incentivized to fight current policy on that.
[14:27:06] <kuudes> yeah
[14:28:16] <kuudes> oh, btw, mjr, please check https://finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2016/20161227#L5P45 2. para? it seems imo to say that cities must give all vaccines a doctor has prescribed? how do you read it?

[14:29:48] <mjr> Looks like it but it seems counterintuitive to me that it should look like it (ie. that the counties would be obligated to arrange for _anything_ a doctor might order) so I'm skeptical there isn't some context I'm missing
[14:30:09] <mjr> ie. I notice that I am confused
[14:33:29] <kuudes> apparently the counties are not required to acquire the substance to vaccinate - you have to get that from pharmacy, but they have to do the injection
[14:33:42] <kuudes> and with covid vaccines, they have the substance already
[14:33:53] <kuudes> and it is not possible to get from anywhere but from them

[14:38:13] <mjr> Ah. Yes.
[14:44:08] <kuudes> btw, vaccinations work wonders, my current prediction for Finland with current vax numbers and omicron is "prediction at 2022-01-28: out of population of 5559980 persons, 466069 is expected to contract symptomatic disease, 6743 is expected to try to get hospitalized, 1091 would require ICU treatment, and 696 is expected to die."
[14:45:56] <feep[work]> 697 die: "CURSES! My model!!"
[14:46:15] <kuudes> XD
[14:46:32] <kuudes> just some month ago it was about 10x higher
[14:46:57] <kuudes> peak got smoothed and we got third doses to large part of population
[14:47:08] <feep[work]> tbf month ago was a different virus
[14:47:21] <kuudes> ~
[14:47:51] <kuudes> omicron is not that much kinder than delta, we just have more third doses
[14:48:12] <kuudes> and omicron's r was closer to delta than presumed
[14:48:16] <feep[work]> hmh
[14:49:25] <kuudes> the game is on the antibodycount exponent
[14:49:53] <kuudes> virus has increased its antibody penetration, but we have increased antibodycounts by factor
[14:50:17] <kuudes> imo we should just vax people a couple of times more to be safe, but for some reason there are other opinions
[14:50:40] <capisce> I hear Finland has a lot of Antti-bodies, maybe that helps

[22:12:33] <gwern> thought he already had it before? I guess he was reinfected

[22:13:11] <kuudes> well, omicron reinfects well, and is he vaxed?

[22:41:52] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The researchers knew from previous work with other species, such as black rhinos, vultures and kangaroo rats, that animals are more likely to settle when they are led to believe that members of their kind are nearby. With this in mind, for half of the birds, the team splattered nontoxic white latex paint on the rocks around burrows in the new location that looked like bird
[22:41:52] <feepbot> poop. They did this because burrowing owls have a tendency to defecate near burrow entrances, and this technique makes the sites look inhabited. To further support this illusion, an outdoor speaker was set up at these sites to periodically play burrowing owl calls during the week before the animals were released from their acclimation enclosures, and during the following week.'

[22:44:38] <feep> seems doable
[22:44:54] <feep> grab owl, show grabbed owl, get an accord
[22:45:05] <feep> smash old burrow, laugh like a crazy person
[22:45:24] <feep> move owl to new burrow, wave it around while throwing white paint like you're making a joke of the owl shitting
[22:45:31] <feep> laugh like a crazy person
[22:45:47] <feep> stick the owl in the new burrow, run away and hope that it's forgotten all that when it wakes up from its discombobulation
[22:46:22] <feep> note: owl may hate you and peck your eyes out
[22:46:35] <feep> otoh, if the chimpanzee tries it, it may peck its eyes out, which seems fair
