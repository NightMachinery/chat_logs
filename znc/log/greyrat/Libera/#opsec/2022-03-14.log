[00:30:24] <Joanna> There have always been things in place to make people think and do what the people in power want. The making everyone think the same thing is sort of old fashioned. They now use the Hegelian dielectric of thesis antithesis and synthesis to maneuver people towards the conclusion they want. Abortion is a good example of both sides being wrong. Niether
[00:31:39] <Joanna> Neither side ever mentions the obvious solution of stopping unmarried women from being encouraged/bullied into having sex.

[00:47:40] <Joanna> Censorship is a cultural thing that follows cultural morays and anything that leads to things outside of cultural morays is forbidden to be discussed unless the people in control are trying to get rid of cultural morays.

[00:59:19] <jan6> one thing is cultural (e.g. there's nothing inherenly "bad" about showing actual sex, or death (assuming that there's warnings about it), censoring it is just cultural), another thing is political censoring, such as "we're taking measures for the greater good, anyone asking too many questions about it is a terrorist", or simply not answering any questions that don't align with your narrative, or
[00:59:20] <jan6> labelling any opposing comments as "hate" and removing them, etc etc

[02:55:51] <Joanna> Hey KillerWasp arahael welcome to channel:)
[02:56:05] <KillerWasp> Joanna: thanks. :)
[02:57:16] <KillerWasp> i'm still understand about of this channel. Is about of cybersecurity?
[02:58:35] <Joanna> It’s about operational & physical security and various other things
[02:58:47] <operational> What
[03:01:17] <Joanna> Hi operational
[03:01:51] <Joanna> I more unique name might prevent being pinged unintentionally
[03:04:24] <operational> :D
[03:04:31] <operational> Just buggin
[03:08:24] <KillerWasp> Joanna: like not related to informatic/computer?
[03:08:47] <KillerWasp> more like the user side.
[03:08:55] <arahael> KillerWasp here was confused about the invite. :)  I see that you two are clarifying what it's all about so I'll leave you to to it?
[03:09:47] <KillerWasp> arahael: yes, something like it. if i can use the internet...
[03:09:57] <arahael> Haha. :)
[03:10:59] <KillerWasp> i guess the most of confusion are cleared.
[03:11:13] <KillerWasp> i also are talk in private mode.
[03:12:16] <Joanna> KillerWasp: I originally recruited to this channel because security channel had been taken over by trolls so I wanted to offer people a more friendly environment for chat so they wouldn’t give up on irc
[03:13:12] <Joanna> I’ve invited a few others from programming like CalimeroTeknik
[03:14:54] <CalimeroTeknik> speaking of rather operational security, I should mention that geraniums are mosquito repellents, and that's why they were cultivated specifically right under windows
[03:15:44] <CalimeroTeknik> that's rather useful to know about, along with artemisia, when malaria comes up North with the warmer climate
[03:16:04] <CalimeroTeknik> https://youtu.be/OvC4uSYprU8
[03:17:03] <Joanna> Thanks CalimeroTeknik I never knew that I thought it was just for looks :)
[03:17:12] <KillerWasp> Joanna: If you could do the same with this world by inviting me to another world I would be delighted. :)
[03:17:34] <CalimeroTeknik> lemongrass is the other one that's efficient with that, Joanna
[03:17:52] <Joanna> This is as close as I get to having my own world lol
[03:17:56] <CalimeroTeknik> or is it called citronelle also in English?
[03:18:13] <Joanna> I like lemons grass smell a lot better than geraniums
[03:18:45] <CalimeroTeknik> if you grow one in your kitchen, you won't get mosquito bites
[03:19:04] <Joanna> Citronella is from citrons which are a citrus fruit I believe I think lemon grass and citrus might have a similar compound in them
[03:19:58] <Joanna> I get eaten alive every summer on my lower legs when I go outside. In the house at least I have screens.
[03:22:15] <KillerWasp> CalimeroTeknik: you mean lemongrass in your kitchen?
[03:25:20] <Joanna> Lemon grass is and kafir lime make amazing flavors in Thai food
[03:26:17] <Joanna> I wonder if lemon peel would repel mosquitoes
[03:26:44] <CalimeroTeknik> KillerWasp, it's quite ideal, for the place yes. additional benefit: it keeps ants away if you mix some in when cleaning the floor
[03:27:00] <CalimeroTeknik> or just in general, it disturbs their sense of smell as it does with mosquitoes
[03:27:49] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: a clean kitchen and ant proof containers also help. Does pine sol stop ants?
[03:29:43] <CalimeroTeknik> essential oil from any citrus is efficient; I noticed the highest efficiency with grapefruit, to erase ant trails
[03:30:06] <Joanna> KillerWasp: this channel also covers computer security
[03:30:27] <CalimeroTeknik> that and a spoon of dishwashing liquid to mop the floor, plus be sure you don't leave crumbs anywhere… you're good
[03:30:48] <CalimeroTeknik> no food, even traces, on the ground, otherwise…
[03:30:48] <Joanna> I’m not an expert in networking so I leave that stuff to other members :)
[03:32:49] <Joanna> Insects don’t really bother me too much I just try to clean up to discourage them. Sometimes I enjoy watching the ants. It strange how the ants sometimes have two ants having a tug of war over an ant in the middle. I’m not sure what that is about.
[03:35:22] <KillerWasp> Joanna: There must be 2 nests close to each other, they meet and fight.
[03:36:03] <KillerWasp> is black ants, sure?
[03:37:46] <KillerWasp> i still can't find about of lemongrass, maybe other day search of it.
[03:38:11] <KillerWasp> if this can scare mosquitoes is useful for me and want one.
[03:39:14] <KillerWasp> really i don't have lucky with the internet today. i have read books instead.
[03:48:01] <Joanna> KillerWasp: maybe an and from wrong colony wandered into the wrong area that would explain it.
[03:48:12] <Joanna> Ant
[03:49:31] <Joanna> I think there are some plants that are made into incense to repel mosquitoes. I forgot the name of them.
[03:50:32] <Joanna> And last summer I bought an insect repellent with a strong peppermint smell to keep mosquitoes from sneaking in when I open screen door.

[14:38:06] <Joanna> jan6: there is no such thing as good as good or evil it’s all opinions which are strongly held and define who we are. For instance I have an opinion that men should not have sex with 5 year old children. I am completely against hearing any arguments in favor of it. An option of this lifestyle should not be advertised nor offered as a possible choice. I don’t care if I’m prejudiced or unfair or irrational.  I’m not sure where 
[14:38:06] <Joanna> the expectation that people should allow things that are contrary to their beliefs came from it’s unreasonable.
[14:41:27] <Joanna> Suppose in a different scenario you are dealing with someone whose only goal in life is to cheat you and everything they do supports this objective. The only thing you can do is refuse to deal with them. You are not going to change them by complaining about how unfair they are like that video indicates. Poor me the people are offering me only choices that favor them. The solution to the problem is obvious. Don’t play their game.

[14:59:16] <jan6> idk where this topic came from, but problem is everyone has DIFFERENT beliefs
[15:01:00] <jan6> e.g. a pedophile would believe that they're not doing anything wrong if the kid agrees, and that they shouldn't be punished, or a more normal person might argue that all pedophiles, murderers, and nazis should get death penalty with no chance to appeal, which is just as bad
[15:01:48] <jan6> and there's definitely still people who believe dark-skinned people are only fit to be slaves and shouldn't be allowed to breathe the same air as them
