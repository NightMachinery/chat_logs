[00:36:16] <lagash> OK, what's the quickest way to "alias" no-script-mode to noscript-mode and/or vice-versa?
[00:47:27] <lagash> Since I'm using both the stable and master versions of Nyxt, it's kinda annoying with the renaming..
[00:50:34] <lagash> https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/2.2.4/source doesn't have the modes moved into their own directory, see?
[01:01:24] *** Quits: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[01:04:54] <jmercouris> lagash: you can use a feature flag and have both
[01:05:04] <jmercouris> So look for #+ in the codebase
[01:05:14] <jmercouris> And in your REPL type *features* to see
[01:05:43] <jmercouris> So you could write #+nyxt-2 and then the predicate that works for version 2.X.Y
[01:05:54] <jmercouris> And then another one for master
[01:08:30] <lagash> jmercouris: sure but then I need to do that for both init and auto-mode
[01:08:43] <lagash> it would be easiest just to alias, no?
[01:11:32] <lagash> (Although I'll look into using feature flags for other things)
[01:14:56] <jmercouris> lagash: maybe maybe not
[01:15:05] <jmercouris> I’m not sure what is easiest
[01:15:28] <jmercouris> Alias would involve basically copying the form and re running it
[01:15:44] <jmercouris> Or keeping track with all side effects of the define mode macro
[01:15:48] <lagash> No defalias macro or something?
[01:30:12] <lagash> OK nvm feature flags will make do
[01:40:32] <lagash> OK I know at least one person's config used "abbreviations" of modes to list in the... status line or whatever it's called. Who's was it? I want to steal :)
[02:00:48] <jmercouris> lagash: mine does, Artyom as well
[02:02:53] <jmercouris> You can see on discourse
[02:03:11] <jmercouris> Basically it just involves setting the glyph for the given mode
[02:13:39] <lagash> Yeah that was it
[02:13:49] <lagash> Also Mery Xmas: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/pull/2022
[02:14:25] <jmercouris> Thank you my ancient Sumerian friend
[02:38:24] <waleee> ... I had forgot you celebrated even later than aartaka
[02:39:19] <lagash> Christmas in... January!
[02:55:26] <lagash> How best can I "merge" these two here? https://bpa.st/I4BA
[02:56:55] <lagash> Perhaps subclass proxy-mode as, say, tor-proxy-mode, and then... how do I do multiple inheritance in CL? Just append the other classes to the superclass declaration portion??
[03:25:41] <qhong> aartaka: Yes, I get it modes can do anything manually in constructor/destructor, and has to be carefully written to be well-behaved (e.g. for a style slot it probably need to do string concatenation in constructor and search&delete in destructor). This is exactly how we do things in Emacs but is directly against Nyxt's "functional" designing principle. And coming from Emacs I'd love it to be fixed, like other fixes Nyxt did
[03:28:44] <qhong> Also anyone ready to merge the nhooks PR? Be sure to test it on your own machine as Nyxt on my machine is not fully functional so I haven't tested all functionalities
[03:40:09] <lagash> While I'm waiting to figure this multiple inheritance "super" modes thing out, I posted my tor-proxy-mode subclass to https://discourse.atlas.engineer/t/tor-v3-onion-address-auto-mode-rule/395/8

[04:09:00] <qhong> lagash: I think besides "super" mode there's also the issue of how multiple unrelated modes (that don't know about each other) affect one buffer.
[04:26:53] <jmercouris> qhong: I’ll try to test tomorrow and at least ping Pierre to

[08:45:58] <qhong> jmercouris: Hmm, toggling in constructor and un-toggling in destructor, that's very Emacs-ish
[08:51:11] <qhong> Just talking about "super" modes, I think we can do it by using CLOS multiple-inheritance and override compute-effective-slot-definition using MOP (e.g. for constructor/destructor, the effective slot definition contains a initform that calls all initform in direct slot definitions)
[08:51:37] <qhong> But still, the problem about how to combine modes from different origins into the same buffer, remains
[09:00:00] <jmercouris> qhong: I see, yes, that’s a different scenario
[09:00:20] <jmercouris> I guess one could remove the constructor and use initialize instance
[09:00:34] <jmercouris> And then do some sort of combination with then
[09:00:52] <jmercouris> We’ve spoken about maybe removing the constructor slot
[09:01:04] <qhong> jmercouris: Ah yes, initialize-instance sound less hackish
[09:01:23] <jmercouris> Indeed
[09:01:41] <qhong> We probably also need a deinitialize-instance though
[09:01:46] <jmercouris> Yes
[09:02:03] <jmercouris> I guess we could define a protocol by implementing a method for it that raises an error
[09:02:09] <qhong> Or instead of using the standard CLOS generic function, we have two generic function mode-enable and mode-disable
[09:02:12] <jmercouris> We could not enforce it at compile time though
[09:02:55] <qhong> I think it's fine to do nothing by default. Maybe some modes don't need a destructor
[09:03:35] <jmercouris> Yes
[09:03:46] <jmercouris> Which is why we also do not enforce this in the current model anyways
