[00:31:17] <char> wow examples are powerful. And help me realize that this is not at all what I'm looking for. Cool project still though.
[00:31:27] <Josh_2> xD
[00:33:31] <Josh_2> Well that can just go back into the "things I dont touch" folder
[00:34:24] <Josh_2> char: what is it you are looking for?
[00:34:26] <char> This is more for making a password manager to keep track of a single user's passwords to many different locations. I am looking for a generic way to keep track of many users' passwords for a single website. I still appreciate your updates.
[00:34:54] <Josh_2> hmm
[00:35:39] <Josh_2> Have a user as a group? Each location an entry, and a single password that you keep to decrypt them
[00:37:21] <char> Something like that could work. The user's password would be the "pass" arg and the and I would make sure that the decrypted result is correct
[00:38:31] <Josh_2> Tbf you can just hack up the source, and make it your own, the important part is the encryption/decryption of passwords, even if you just took the functions below *prng* you would off to a good start
[00:39:06] <Josh_2> I believe that the encryption used by default is basically the hardest ironclad has, threefish1024, a 128bit IV and a sha512 hashed key
[00:40:32] <Josh_2> total overkill btw
[00:41:45] <char> I could, but for now, I want something that just works.

[03:53:19] <aeth> OK, I'm stumped. Is there a way to check for EOF without hanging when it's a byte stream? With a character stream it's just testing against READ-CHAR-NO-HANG.
[03:57:41] <aeth> Because LISTEN (the only way to not hang with a byte input stream?) appears to have the extreme design flaw of returning NIL on EOF, but the byte stream consisting solely of EOF is still OPEN-STREAM-P (which is so the EOF can be read) so that check won't work, either.
[03:59:35] <_death> yeah, unfortunately there is no read-byte-no-hang.. in my dbus library I assumed the stream was bivalent and used read-char-no-hang

[04:06:16] <aeth> So does usocket have a way to test this by testing the TCP connection instead of testing the stream? Because usocket apparently came from cl-irc and this is *really* basic IRC stuff... losing a connection to a server.
[04:08:21] <aeth> An IRC stream must be a byte stream rather than a character stream because unless UTF8ONLY, then the encoding of IRC is not guaranteed to be UTF8... and UTF8ONLY can only be established in the RPL_ISUPPORT which must happen after the connection is established, on at least the 5th line.
[04:11:54] <aeth> (And UTF8ONLY is not a common extension.)

[10:23:45] <mayuresh> anyone, and "beach" especially, would you comment on the state in which code is stored within a commonlisp development environment?
[10:23:48] *** Joins: bhaible (~bruno@dslb-088-068-034-084.088.068.pools.vodafone-ip.de)
[10:24:00] <mayuresh> is it in source form? or is it compiled intermediate representation?
[10:24:48] <White_Flame> it's in fully compiled form.  The textual source form is on disk in your .lisp files, and the debug info might have the read sexpr format of your code and possibly line/column/file references
[10:25:07] <White_Flame> (this all is common for implementations nowadays, not mandated by the language)
[10:25:49] <mayuresh> White_Flame: i am very new to commonlisp, so consider this a naieve question.
[10:25:50] <White_Flame> since no CL implementations do JIT-style recompilation, there's no need for them to retain the source except for debugging support
[10:26:26] <mayuresh> White_Flame: my point exactly, how do commercial commonlisp environments support debugging without distributing their source?
[10:26:30] <White_Flame> no problem.  There's also #clschool, as this place might get you firehose-of-details response
[10:26:31] <White_Flame> s
[10:26:55] <White_Flame> what do mean by "debugging" specifically ehre?
[10:27:38] <White_Flame> if an error comes up, the internal function names and stack trace for its commercial internals are likely present, but there's no access to the source
[10:28:04] <mayuresh> okay, there's stack trace then.
[10:28:15] <mayuresh> good enough.
[10:28:26] <mayuresh> also, there's hardly anyone around on "clschool".
[10:28:41] <mayuresh> was there a few days back, no one even responded to my "hello".
[10:28:44] <White_Flame> all those names are highly tied to the notion of CL symbols & packages, which are runtime objects describing & hooking into functions & values
[10:28:59] <White_Flame> yeah, the freenode->libera transition has taken a bit of toll
[10:29:08] *** Joins: bpanthi977 (~Thunderbi@103.152.144.53)
[10:29:42] <mayuresh> ah, so it was on freenode earlier! why the transition to libera?
[10:30:39] <White_Flame> hostile takeover of freenode, and its deletion of channels, and of the entire network (to be replaced by an empty one with the same name) afterward
[10:31:01] *** Quits: cjb (~cjb@user/cjb) (Quit: rcirc on GNU Emacs 28.0.50)
[10:31:02] <White_Flame> old freenode staff that bailed from the takeover started libera, and most freenode channels came here
[10:31:04] <aeth> new owner got power hungry and started killing channels... then k-lined tor and irccloud and possibly other servers... and then wiped literally everything and replaced it with a new network that happens to have the same domain name... one that apparently autokills you if you say the wrong words
[10:31:10] <aeth> basically just a domain name squat now

[10:32:08] <mayuresh> okay.

[10:40:46] <mayuresh> i found the "common lisp pro" mailing list, any comments about it?
[10:40:50] <mayuresh> https://mailman.common-lisp.net/listinfo/pro
[10:41:04] <White_Flame> it's very low volume, but it's generally decent
[10:41:20] <White_Flame> irc is quite good
[10:41:51] <White_Flame> usenet still is a thing, and is quite not good ;)
[10:41:56] <mayuresh> are they any other such mailing lists? realtime get's too much sometime.
[10:42:01] <White_Flame> ah
[10:42:27] <aeth> the difference between IRC and Usenet is that IRC spam filters, while with Usenet it's up to you to filter the noise afaik
[10:42:33] <White_Flame> none comes to mind.  There are some reddit groups and a discord or two out there as well
[10:42:45] <aeth> r/lisp is fairly active

[10:44:00] <White_Flame> I don't know, I've only heard mention of it a few times, no clue how big it is either
[10:45:05] <White_Flame> I'd recommend staying here, personally ;)
[10:45:20] <spiaggia> mayuresh: Obviously, the commercial vendors do not distribute source code with their system, like the compiler, so the source information is very likely limited to your own application and others that you loaded from source.
[10:45:51] <mayuresh> White_Flame: okay. :)
[10:46:14] <aeth> IRC's resilient because when there's a hostile change in course, everyone can just move to a new network. Other chats, not so much.
[10:46:16] <pjb> mayuresh: the cl channel on freenode was probably a chilean channel ;-)
[10:46:34] <pjb> people could move from facebook to vk
[10:46:36] <mayuresh> spiaggia: yeah, i was wondering about debugging deep hierarchies like a "clos" inheritance, but with stack traces and symbol tables that seems okay to be without source.

[10:47:17] <spiaggia> pjb: I see.
[10:48:25] <pjb> mayuresh: that's the question of debugging, and transmitting debuggin information from the compiler to the execution/debugging environment.  There are file format defined, such as DWARF.
[10:48:41] <pjb> mayuresh: but in CL, it's integrated.
[10:49:04] <pjb> mayuresh: just compile with (declaim (optimize (debug 3)))
[10:49:22] <mayuresh> pjb: i'm not ready for that level yet. :)

[10:50:56] <pjb> They're two few, with two few customers, so that it's a big problem that need a technological solution to help.
[10:51:07] <pjb> mayuresh: so they just don't.
[10:51:13] <White_Flame> well, commercial providers of lisp software is a bit different than commercial providers of lisp dev implementations
[10:51:35] <White_Flame> you can just ship an executable, and it's the same as any other language in terms of privateness
[10:51:37] <pjb> mayuresh: but theorically, it's possible to use a CL to C compiler, and to use code protection tools.

[10:52:10] <aeth> I mean, Lisp isn't Java. Decompiling Lisp isn't going to help you too much because of the macros. You'll be able to (if anyone cared to write such a tool) get a plausible guess of what the macroexpanded version would look like, and perhaps handle the common or built-in macros, but quite a lot of code could be generated from unknown DEFMACROs
[10:52:18] <mayuresh> pjb: is it also theoretically possible to write a 'cl' to csharp compiler?

[22:04:46] <mayuresh> is "fare" around at the moment?
[22:05:48] <jackdaniel> no. he decided that gerbil scheme better suits his tastes
[22:05:59] <mayuresh> sad.
[22:06:13] <mayuresh> any ideas about his identity?
[22:06:23] <mayuresh> would love to communicate with him via email.
[22:07:02] <jackdaniel> you may look it up in the internet; he doesn't hide it. that said please keep in mind that offtopic would be more appreciated on channels like #lispcafe

[22:12:04] <mayuresh> just "fare" would be too limited.
