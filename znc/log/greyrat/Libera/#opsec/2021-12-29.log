[03:51:32] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[03:57:47] *** Joins: dingdreher (~dingdrehe@46.140.25.62)
[04:03:18] <Joanna> jan6: I just keep the internet turned off on my computer turned off or shut down entirely
[04:14:25] <jan6> heh, sure, fit for the leader of opsec
[04:14:55] <Joanna> Lol
[04:15:16] <jan6> I only have a laptop, and that's either in use (which means needs net), or in suspend mode, AKA inactive
[04:15:59] <Joanna> Do laptops still access internet when lid is down?
[04:17:35] <jessicara> if they hibernate or sleep, probably not
[04:17:54] <jessicara> although they may or may not depending on the type of sleep and other possible configuration
[04:18:09] <jessicara> there may or may not be remote management weirdness with some
[04:19:54] <Joanna> Can a closed laptop be hacked if it’s connected to internet?
[04:20:22] <Joanna> I hope not...
[04:21:17] <Joanna> Maybe though newer laptops only pretend to be off or suspended in the same way as mobile phones
[04:21:34] <jessicara> if it's not set to sleep with the lid down: same as when it's lid is up and what might be vulnerable on it, hibernate and power off: probably not, suspended: management tends to still run in some form and may or may not be vulnerable, but better than full-on at least i guess
[04:22:12] <jessicara> some seem to actually disable the network enough that i can't see it online at least
[04:22:39] <jessicara> there's stuff like wake on packet which might be left and forgot to exist
[04:24:20] <Joanna> Hmm
[04:24:45] <Joanna> I think it sleeps when lid is down
[04:25:13] <jan6> 02:45 <Joanna> Do laptops still access internet when lid is down?
[04:25:16] <jan6> depends what it does
[04:25:24] <jan6> there's different power levels
[04:25:27] <jessicara> yeah, it's unfortunately not a simple yes or no question
[04:25:37] <jessicara> ...and intel remote management was a thing
[04:25:47] <jan6> you can have it be on as normal, which is nice for external displays, for example
[04:26:34] <jan6> or set os's "sleep" mode, which may or may not be the ACPI S3 Sleep mode
[04:27:35] <jan6> well, S3 is "suspend to ram", which is good generally
[04:28:24] <jan6> you can always do "hibernation" aka "suspend to disk", and remove the battery (if you're sane enough to use a laptop with removable battery)
[04:28:31] <Joanna> So if you allow remote access it can be accessed in sleep mode remotely?
[04:28:43] <jan6> https://onlinehelp.ncr.com/Retail/Workstations/7613/HTML/Topics/UserGuide/5.%20Power%20Management/3-ACPI%20Sleep%20States%20(S0%20-%20S5).htm gives a bit of overview of the ACPI power levels
[04:29:45] <jan6> well, the management tools in the cpu itself run independently, in a different "ring", anyway, you can never force it to do anything, and since it's closed source, you can never be sure what it's doing
[04:30:26] <jan6> the hardware does need quick re-initializing when resuming from sleep
[04:30:43] <jan6> so I would assume not
[04:30:59] <jan6> but I don't have resources to test it
[04:31:01] *** Quits: dingdreher (~dingdrehe@46.140.25.62) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:31:53] <jan6> "S1" state is "standby", in which nothing is lost, and all would be accessible, and is probably what you're thinking of
[04:35:07] <jan6> s3 is specifically low-power suspend, where nothing from the OS runs (I don't think even the trigger checking is done by OS?), loses cache and cpu context (the OS is responsible for maintaining it), and of course there is the S4 "suspend to disk", in which even more stuff is turned off, and with even lower power consumption
[04:35:28] <jan6> the management engine is ALWAYS powered, though
[04:36:06] <Hydragyrum> *cough* IME backdoors *cough*
[04:36:08] <jan6> even with S5 "soft power off" (in which you can power on via LAN, for example, but otherwise it's basically shut down)
[04:36:16] <jan6> just disable your ME ;P
[04:37:38] <jan6> if you want real secure system, you'd use one for which it's confirmed that you can wipe the ME, and then wipe it, and even better if you also run a custom BIOS/EFI bootloader
[04:38:18] <jan6> although the latter would likely prevent, or at least make much harder to update device firmware, should you want/need to do that

[09:47:31] <epony> your NIC, HDD, SSD and storage controller and SoC and SPI all have firmwares
[09:47:47] <epony> same for your GPU and CPU
[09:49:34] <epony> look better at a system where you can interchange the components and pick their models and firmwares at your own choice without disclosing that to your online vendor
[09:51:26] <epony> a laptop is as insecure as a any other SoC appliance, even with disabling some in CPU feature and using a non-original firmware replacement, with unknown hardware and on chip firmware present at many other places you did not fix
[09:52:43] <epony> you simply can not fix hardware, firmware and microcode problems built into complex SoC in your sub-device controller board assemblies
[09:53:22] <epony> you can do small steps that do not solve the hardware and firmware undiscovered and unvalidated functionality
[09:53:49] <epony> you also have to learn about CPU pumping and othe behaviour attacks at storage and networking to get your hair to really stand up
[09:54:45] <epony> you also can not fix hardware bugs that are a result of defective or incorrect design of the chips and their unintended or secretive failure modes of abuse and misuse
[09:55:34] <epony> a more "niche" and "proprietary" and "tightly integrated" hardware commercial product as a malware delivery vector is the worst you can do, in any evaluation
[09:57:52] <epony> your only viable choices is to not use devices and appliances where you do not control COMPLETELY the programming and technical control of the entire set of electronics with modifiable and generally or specialised programmable functionality
[09:59:08] <epony> that includes ROM and chip reprogramming built-in units, CPU cores and their technical and programming documentation and sofware and hardware reprogramming kits
[09:59:34] <epony> that includes the programmable programmer built into your reprogrammable chips
[10:00:22] <epony> you also have chips which are modified physically and electrically after programming, that make that programming fixed and unmodifiable, but it has defects and unknown operation you do not control or can not upgrade
[10:01:51] <epony> you also have chip debugging and dumping functionality remotely exposed and accessible without device disassembly or physical access by most DMA connected periphery
[10:03:45] <epony> just "one" of the problems addressed incompletely and not even sorting its defects or upgrading it to a correctly operating programming, is not a solution, but a user contrived device functionalit and a defect, that prevents some of the trivial and most critical remote exploits, but not all, and not with any assurance
[10:04:50] <epony> advertising a proprietary SoC type appliance like a commercial brand laptop with deep nested implants is brainless marketing
[10:05:55] <epony> it generates false sense of security and is not solving the problems, it raises sales numbers for "security conscious" naive people
[10:07:34] <epony> your only choice is to study and use completely modifiable and programmable systems of the "open architecture" platforms like assembled modular computers that you or a trusted by you non-commercial / non-regulated provider gives you
[10:08:13] <epony> that excludes commercial companies operating in UKUSA region and the dominion states of those
[10:10:47] <epony> laptops are not a good choice for a secure system, they are defective by any analysis of computer and data security, and can only be used as personal entertainment or infotainment consoles outside any security operation, or under special requirements in controlled environments with reprogrammed internals that comply with certified specifications
[10:11:39] <epony> even then, they are insecure and not suitable, just used for low priority communications tasks
[10:13:41] <epony> the worst you can do is get a proprietary laptop and claim 'secure' by advice on the Internet, that's really not serious and reasonable
[10:14:54] <epony> check and validate for yourself or work as a group or with security research groups to avoide laptops and embedded tightly integrated appliances without complete reverse engineering and reprogramming
[10:14:59] <epony> the rest is false info
[10:15:43] <epony> good luck, don't listen to "marketing" for brands and models, laptops are insecure, period

[14:40:04] <Joanna> epony: thanks for the info. I keep my laptop wifi off most of the time but as you say I can’t be 100% sure what it’s doing. Maybe wifi by it’s very nature is less secure that a physical wired connection that can be unplugged. On a side note I’ve been told stories about modern wifi routers transmitting very strong signals which were not for the benefit of the owner of the router. Kind of like google is mapping out location of 
[14:40:04] <Joanna> every router as they drive around or something like that.
[14:41:32] <Joanna> I don’t remember the details of what brand of router was doing this.

[18:19:09] <jan6> 08:27 <epony> your only viable choices is to not use devices and appliances where you do not control COMPLETELY the programming and technical control of the entire set of electronics with modifiable and generally or specialised programmable functionality
[18:19:20] <jan6> sooo. basically FPGA is the only trustable computer?
[18:21:27] <jan6> wifi is 100% insecure, Joanna, even when wpa3 was unveiled, it was soo poorly designed people found a way to hack it before it even landed in routers and other devices, lmao
[18:22:47] <jan6> if you sniff a bit, you can break pretty much any normal wpa and wep access point in like, <1 hour, I think, and you can also use the captured packets to bruteforce on your local computer, so the wifi point never knows about it
[18:23:44] <jan6> I'm not sure, but the "enterprise" security might be a bit less ridiculously insecure, I've not happened upon anyone describing cracking that
[18:24:17] <jan6> and that allows you to auth with e.g. client certificates, so it'd be too hard to bruteforce, in that case, anyway
[18:28:05] *** Joins: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50:3d6e:cfa4:63ac:b4be)
[18:29:56] <iz> i agree w/ jan6 -- firmware/hardware paranoia can end up being silly because you don't go far enough and are hypocritical of your own premise and if you go that far, you might as well just not use technology anymore
[18:32:55] <jan6> with any software, there's also always the possibility of the once-famous-but-now-forgotten Ken Thompson Hack
[18:35:30] <jan6> the only way to truly make sure your system isn't KTH-ed, is to manually build it in entirety, starting from writing binary bootloader using switches, then work up to an assembler, linker, C compiler, etc, and even then only YOU can be sure it's safe, nobody else can
[18:35:32] <iz> i just think of it like hilbert's angst in trying to formalize mathematics
[18:35:52] <jan6> same idea would apply for hardware, you can't be sure it's safe unless you built every component yourself
[18:36:03] <iz> but with computing -- in that you just have to take a baseline and say certain things are just axioms
[18:36:42] <iz> but even those things can't be concretely proven
[18:37:03] <jan6> but if you did every component yourself you'd never be able to build a powerful enough computer to do anything other than like, slow, terminal computing, would probably be hard to get even networking and SSH to work, if you have to DIY network adapter
[18:37:21] <jan6> ye
[18:37:48] <jan6> you could, also, just assume all components are evil, and design physical safeguards
[18:38:22] <iz> yeah.. so you either just accept these things as axioms and are able do do math.. or you paralyze/cripple yourself and circle the drain w/ things that have already been done many times decades before
[18:39:06] <jan6> like, status LEDs, and if the computer triggers e.g. sleep, then it gets, say, 3 seconds of grace time to properly shut down devices, after which those devices are physically disconnected from data lanes (and possibly power, depending on what they are)
[18:39:35] <iz> even if you do it all yourself, it's pure arrogance to assume you would do it right the first time and never make a mistake that could be captialized on
[18:40:33] <jan6> well, even if you did it right enough, it'd be a huge challenge to do it in a way that you can actually DO anything useful with it, more than with any ol' scientific calculator
[18:40:53] <iz> yeah
[18:41:44] <iz> moreover, there are things you should actually worry about and that will actually improve your security/privacy
[18:42:07] <iz> and if you get bogged down w/ being worried about the wrong things, you are just confusing yourself and wasting your own time
[18:49:33] <jan6> also, slightly related, a few guys have actually figured out how to do basic chip wafer printing at "home", it's not that reliable, it's not even as small/complex as many 90's era chips, but it would actually allow creation of custom chips, with some further development, which would at least allow you to make sure you know exactly what is going on inside it, and reduce the footprint compared to a
[18:49:34] <jan6> normal TTL computer
[18:52:42] <fnk> jan6: I've happened to do some Wi-Fi audits in the past
[18:52:54] <jan6> and?
[18:53:08] <fnk> WPA2-Enterprise with tls client certificates could be relatively secure
[18:53:14] <fnk> but apart from that you're right
[18:53:57] <jan6> nice to know I'm right every once in a while ;P
[18:54:05] <fnk> It was ridiculous that i could capture the handshake within a few minutes
[18:54:09] <fnk> and then bruteforce it locally
[18:54:31] <fnk> of course it depends on the password strength, but most consumer routers have shitty passwords deployed by default
[18:54:35] <fnk> and people don't bother to change them
[18:54:50] <jan6> I kinda wonder how much worse bluetooth security actually is, lol
[18:55:04] <jan6> of course default passwords are a joke, too
[18:55:57] <fnk> I don't have experience with bluetooth, unfortunately, but I definitely don't trust it
[18:55:58] <jan6> it's not as if it's any hard to just create a (pseudo)random default password for each device and print it on a little label onto it, there's even several devices that do that
[18:56:48] <fnk> yeah
[18:57:20] <fnk> the funny thing is that some operators do that, but the passwords are 8 characters long
