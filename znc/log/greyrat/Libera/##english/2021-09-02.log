[10:25:09] <furrykef> I just learned what might be my favorite Old English word: horshwæl, i.e., horse-whale.
[10:25:12] <furrykef> It means 'walrus'.
[10:28:31] <twb> furrykef: you know about seacows?
[10:28:57] <twb> also kamelleopards
[10:29:31] <hoglahoo> oh is that what camelopardalis is
[10:29:46] <twb> I think my favourite is when Zheng He brought the emperer some giraffes, and the court was like "we don't know what the fuck these are, and we don't know what the fuck dragons look like, so these must be dragons"
[10:30:07] <furrykef> "Seacow" rings a bell, faintly

[10:31:16] <twb> "Kirin is the Japanese form of "qilin", which has also come to be used in the modern Japanese word for a giraffe"

[10:39:05] <twb> I always assumed they were smashed against reefs
[10:40:18] <pussipupu> Dunno, there's stories of mermaids luring ships onto rocks but also of mermaids luring individuals into the water
[10:40:44] <pussipupu> It's possible that humans are both weird and horny, and also a bit crap at navigation
[10:40:44] <hoglahoo> any of sailors luring mermaids into ships?

[12:15:02] <zitter> hi, italian native here. Is this https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616DybuxVRL._SX522_.jpg called "timekeeper" or "timemarker"? And how you call the action of passing badge/fingerprint/smartphone of that machine to do a timestamp? TIA :)
[12:19:20] <blkshp> If this is the thing that you access when you start work to determine when you stated I'd call it a "timeclock" and "clocking in" but that may be specifically British English. (Also we say "What do you call" not "how do you call"

[17:15:52] <darsie> I think "I don't want children anymore." and "I don't want any more children." is better.

[17:16:29] <darsie> Gut feeling of a German native speaker ;).
[17:17:36] <darsie> The former means I have no children, I wanted some, but now I don't anymore.

[19:33:26] <CuriosTiger> I second juvenile.
[19:33:35] <CuriosTiger> and I just noticed how much that resembles Spanish joven.
[19:34:10] <LuisP14> it is from latin

[19:43:17] <bin> i read joven as jawn for some reason and I was like "there's no way that has a spanish origin??" i need to wake up lol
[19:45:04] <CuriosTiger> heh
[19:45:09] <CuriosTiger> So I am really liking Instacart.
[19:45:11] <LuisP14> lol
[19:45:20] <CuriosTiger> THey do all the shopping. I just show up at the grocery store and they put stuff in my trunk.
[19:45:31] <CuriosTiger> don't even have to get out of the car.
[19:45:34] <bin> yeah i'm going to have to start using curbside again i think
[19:45:41] <bin> with delta being so insane
[19:45:51] <bin> but i actualy like grocery shopping. i missed doing it last year
[19:46:05] <CuriosTiger> I miss it in a way too
[19:46:09] <bin> i like going and picking out my meat and stuff
[19:46:25] <bin> I've had to do more returns with curbside than when i do my own shop
[19:46:30] <bin> and i hate that

[19:46:54] <LuisP14> ok
[19:46:56] <bin> and yeah same.
[19:47:03] <bin> yeah the store we like uses shipt which i LOVE
[19:47:15] <CuriosTiger> I haven't tried to shipt
[19:47:16] <bin> because they text me all the replacements, and then ask if i want a callback to discuss them
[19:47:30] <bin> i dont know if it's shipt that's amazing or the fact that it's integrated into the store

[19:47:48] <bin> nice
[19:47:48] <pussipupu> I'm lucky things have stayed relatively normal here, a combination of lower population density and reasonable management I guess
[19:48:03] <CuriosTiger> Some people live like normal here
[19:48:09] <CuriosTiger> I did for a bit after I got vaccinated
[19:48:15] <CuriosTiger> now I'm getting worried again
[19:48:23] <CuriosTiger> I do need to get out to Oklahoma to pick up my car.
[19:48:35] <CuriosTiger> which has been under repair for 3 months now after the accident in June.
[19:48:49] <bin> i never really resumed normality entirely but i did eat outside a few times
[19:48:55] <bin> and went back to grocery shopping
[19:48:58] <bin> but always masked
[19:49:10] <CuriosTiger> I've been wearing a mask as well
[19:49:16] <CuriosTiger> but prior to being vaccinated, I was a complete recluse
[19:49:16] <pussipupu> I don't think there's any food delivery services here
[19:49:22] <CuriosTiger> asthma and COVID don't mix.
[19:49:31] <bin> same
[19:49:32] <pussipupu> But we've never not been able to go to the shops, with reasonable caution of course
[19:49:44] * LuisP14 heard that there's a new strain
[19:49:46] <bin> i dont have asthma but i have extremely severe allergies
[19:49:46] <pussipupu> I really hope masks stay normal in shops and stuff during flu and covid season
[19:49:52] <CuriosTiger> WE were able to. But I live in an area full of anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers
[19:49:59] <pussipupu> We're up to the µ strain now
[19:50:11] <pussipupu> Though I've not heard much about its characteristics
[19:50:16] <CuriosTiger> so I wasn't prepared to risk it, even if I was technically allowed to
[19:50:55] <pussipupu> There's someone at work I suspect isn't getting vaccinated
[19:51:00] <CuriosTiger> "Geraldine is shopping. 14 of 27 items shopped."
[19:51:04] <pussipupu> Which is a bit of a worry
[19:51:10] <CuriosTiger> Yep
[19:51:31] <LuisP14> so what happened to the seven in between? :3
[19:51:33] <CuriosTiger> we were ordered back to the offices. I was exempt, because I had WFH status even prior to the pandemic, but most peopel went back
[19:51:43] <CuriosTiger> then our Seattle office had a COVID outbreak and that order was quickly reversed.
[19:51:44] <bin> CuriosTiger: same tbh, plus ive been wary of breakthrough cases from the start
[19:51:55] <CuriosTiger> LuisP14: She's still shopping.
[19:52:08] <bin> i have to take asthma meds and antihistimines all year so i try not to mess about with these things
[19:52:32] <CuriosTiger> Same. Symbicort and Claritin-D, plus Bricanyl that I have to bring in from Europe
[19:52:35] <LuisP14> erm, the seven strains, lol
[19:52:38] <bin> oof
[19:52:47] <CuriosTiger> because apparently, the US has decided that rescue inhalers should be albuterol and only albuterol
[19:52:54] <CuriosTiger> and that gives me terrible jitters
[19:53:21] <bin> singulair for me and zyrtec (allegra works better but cant take allegra if youre trying to have a baby!) and flonase sensmist when it's this time of year and i get the sinus stabbies
[19:53:41] <bin> i didnt know all rescue inhalers were akbuterol
[19:53:44] <bin> albuterol*
[19:53:50] <bin> that seems... dumb considering some people don't respond well
[19:53:54] <CuriosTiger> They're not, I'm exaggerating.
[19:53:56] <bin> oh 
[19:54:10] <bin> well it wouldn't entirely surprise me, just slightly
[19:54:18] <CuriosTiger> I'm just frustrated that a perfectly safe drug (terbutaline) that is FDA-approved and that I've been using for decades appears to be unobtainium in the US
[19:54:29] <bin> that is extremely frustrating
[19:54:30] <CuriosTiger> you can get it in Canada. Or Mexico. Or the Bahamas. Even in Cuba. But not in the mighty USA.
[19:54:36] <bin> wtf that's so odd
[19:54:49] <CuriosTiger> I'm guessing big pharma politics are to blame.
[19:54:54] <bin> if it were not FDA approved for some reason I could see that... but wtf?? it's FDA approved so should be obtainable
[19:54:59] <bin> could very well be
[19:55:14] <bin> I'm a big fan of "big pharma" in general but the politics are NASTY
[19:55:17] <CuriosTiger> Like US pharmaceutical company cockblocking European pharmaceutical company
[19:55:30] <CuriosTiger> but I'm only speculating.
