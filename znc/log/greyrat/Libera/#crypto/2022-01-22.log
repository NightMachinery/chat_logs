[00:47:56] <Alipha> caveman: same thing that guarantees everything else on the blockchain: consensus. one miner creates a block which contains the results of a smart contract transaction. all the miners execute the smart contract code and they should all get the same result the block submitter did. if the other miners don't agree with the resulting block, then the rest of the miners ignore the block that was created
[00:49:01] <Alipha> same thing happens if a miner tried to submit a block that contained a transaction from Alice to Bob with a signature that doesn't match Alice's public key: the rest of the miners would see the signature is invalid and ignore the block
[00:49:16] <sarnold> and the ones that are hooked up to launch the ICBMs, do they just launch when they execute it? or do they wait for others to generate concensus first?
[00:50:15] <TimMc> Presumably they wait for n blocks of consensus, then launch ze missiles.
[00:50:46] <Alipha> and hopefully, additionally, verify the accuracy of the block themselves

[06:05:30] <TimMc> In the meantime I've been playing around with how I'd represent two keys in a user-friendly way (for the rare cases where someone might need to enter something from paper). 64 bytes with 8 checksum bytes, Base32 encoded, looks like 4 lines of this:
[06:05:34] <TimMc> ogiqn-gte2a-vyzww-ppqux-gwpk3-vve6m
[06:06:01] <TimMc> (with a couple bytes of space remaining for an identifying prefix)
[06:06:20] <TimMc> Not *too* awful. Definitely typable.
[06:07:34] <TimMc> I also found the article I'd been thinking of earlier, which turned out to be a redesign of the Signal safety numbers from 5 years ago: https://signal.org/blog/safety-number-updates/
[06:07:42] <TimMc> Great UX thought in that post.
[06:08:23] <cehteh> i'd prefer 3char groups, case insensitive  OGI-QNG-....
[06:09:07] <cehteh> thats handleable for dylexic persons to some extend
[06:09:48] <iz> 10 of those though?
[06:09:51] <cehteh> mingle the checksum bits into each group so you can ask/highlight a group thats faulty already
[06:10:29] <iz> i think w/ that much data, groups of 5 is good.. and it's already case-insensitive
[06:10:38] <cehteh> also i once had to transport a key over a phone call which was really horrible
[06:10:44] <iz> uhg
[06:10:46] <TimMc> cehteh: Yeah, 64 divides by 8 nicely. :-)
[06:11:09] <TimMc> and you get faster feedback that way
[06:11:40] <iz> that's where knowing at least the first 6 letters in the nato phonetic alphabet really comes in handy
[06:12:01] <TimMc> cehteh: With base32, you could use upper or lower case as desired for the local display or entry format.
[06:12:18] <TimMc> (that is, it's already case sensitive)
[06:13:28] <TimMc> cehteh: Reading a key over the phone? That's almost as bad as trying to tell someone your email address. :-P
[06:14:57] <cehteh> it was more worse than you imagince
[06:15:01] <TimMc> ...hmm, having the checksum digits be part of the raw data is a problem, because then you have to do Annoying Math in order to figure out how that maps to the base32 display.
[06:15:58] <cehteh> german healthcare stuff, the vpn router password can only be reseted remotely, then they dicated you a key you have to enter and then you can type in a new password

[06:19:43] <TimMc> Well, in the DB it would be the two separate keys each as hex.
[06:19:52] <TimMc> This would just be for user display.
[06:21:00] <cehteh> thats my saying, what would it cost to hold the 'display' version in the DBÃŸ

[06:21:26] <cehteh> i dont think so

[06:26:01] <TimMc> although I need to go back and figure out why I used hex, because I thought there was a good reason but it looks like sqlite should be able to store bytes just fine...
[06:26:17] <cehteh> yeah
[06:29:19] <TimMc> There's the DB, there's the user display, and then of course there's also the wire format in the protocol.
[06:29:45] <TimMc> Luckily, I'm using a serialization format that just allows byte arrays (MessagePack).
[06:31:46] <TimMc> Makes signed data convenient, too.
[06:35:45] <TimMc> I can do the equivalent of {..., signed_stuff: {data: bytes, sig: bytes}, ...} and then the data is just another msgpack serialization! Very low overhead.
[06:36:21] <TimMc> In this case, the data format will be {payload: ..., timestamp: int, context: str}
[06:36:50] <TimMc> No need to worry about canonicalization and all that nonsense. Just use layers.

[06:59:52] <Alipha> rk4: unfortunately, composing encryption and authentication yourself via AES-CBC+HMAC has so many pitfalls, that it's much better to use a combined "authenticated encryption" algo, such as AES-GCM. (do you encrypt-then-mac, mac-then-encrypt, or encrypt-and-mac? Is it important to include the IV in the mac? And remember to validate the mac using a constant-time algorithm)
[07:01:13] <maroon> i guess you mac everything that's not attacker controllable, and even then sometimes you still mac it
[07:03:29] <maroon> TimMc, as for reading a key over the phone, instead you can take the sha256 hash of the key, then translate each byte into a language word from the pgp-word-list, and then read those 256/8=32 words over the phone
[07:04:13] <TimMc> maroon: That's assuming you just want to compare for equality.
[07:05:01] <maroon> the pgp word list has 2 separage groups of 256 words, for odd vs even bytes, to defend against accidental skips/dupes
[07:05:09] <TimMc> haha nice
[07:05:50] <maroon> well even if the literal key is 128 bits, that's still 'only' 16 spoken words
