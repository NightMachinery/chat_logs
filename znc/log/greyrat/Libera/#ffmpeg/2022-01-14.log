[00:04:07] <jarthur> If I take BT.709 YUV 4:2:0 video and output to a rgb24 PNG file with default options, what color space/transfer func does the resulting PNG file have? sRGB?
[00:05:26] <JEEB> depends on what you're utilizing as the filter and exact parameters for the conversion
[00:05:47] *** Quits: fling (~fling@user/fling) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:06:04] <JEEB> you can learn of the parameters at play from reading H.273
[00:06:10] <JEEB> that explains the three parameters

[00:06:45] <JEEB> anyways, I'm not sure but I wouldn't be surprised if the transfer isn't touched by the swscale-based scale filter
[00:07:27] <JEEB> also it depends on the YCbCr side's transfer function
[00:08:06] <JEEB> I expect it's tagged BT.709, which then if you want to convert that to sRGB transfer would be to do BT.1886 to linear, and then apply sRGB transfer
[00:08:32] <JEEB> of course, most applications do not seem to do this and they don't adjust the transfer at all when rendering YCbCr :P
[00:09:14] <jarthur> Let's say the three parameters are BT.709, like typical progressive HD material, and that both the container and video stream bitstream are correctly tagged. If I just do this:

[00:10:54] <jarthur> ffmpeg -i original_yuv_content.mkv %06d.png
[00:11:15] <JEEB> alright, that will auto-insert the scale filter which you will see with `-v verbose` or higher
[00:11:16] *** Quits: Flabb (~Flabb@89.169.42.92) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:12:05] <jarthur> Thanks, and will the scale filter default to outputting sRGB, or will it maintain BT.709 all the way through and embed the BT.709 ICC profile in the PNG for downstream XYZ and gamma conversion?
[00:12:42] <JEEB> that filter has various logic built-in but I'm still not sure if it will correctly read out the BT.709 metadata from the input AVFrame
[00:13:29] <JEEB> I'm pretty sure it doesn't do transfer adjustment so most likely the result will still have the BT.709 (BT.1886 for rendering purposes) transfer there
[00:13:44] <JEEB> which is not really uncommon in software :P
[00:14:15] <JEEB> I think you can compare against the zimg-using zscale filter
[00:14:37] <JEEB> that one seems to be utilizing the input AVFrame information much more openly
[00:14:45] <JEEB> for output you will have to of course set things
[00:16:30] <JEEB> -vf "zscale,format=pix_fmts=gbrp" will just do a matrix conversion, and leave the primaries and transfer as-is
[00:17:13] <JEEB> then you can look at the parameters listed in `ffmpeg -h filter=zscale`
[00:18:19] <JEEB> where you can then specify primaries and transfer, and I think if you specify the sRGB transfer you get that conversion as well

[00:20:06] <JEEB> I use zscale for going the other way (sRGB renders into BT.709 matrix), and there i don't do a transfer conversion but instead specify the sRGB iec61966-2-1 transfer
[00:20:47] <JEEB> thankfully all the players I care about handle that correctly (and those players that don't do anything about transfer functions also get the "correct result" since it's the sRGB transfer)
[00:40:31] <jarthur> Thanks for the insights. Guess I'll just have to try it and see

[09:41:03] <alphamule> Hmm
[09:41:23] <alphamule> Programs can guess but normally, you use the IFOs to index them?
[09:43:15] <alphamule> You're wanting to demux them, I'd guess you'd say.
[09:43:47] <Agafnd> I suppose.
[09:44:48] <alphamule> Hehe, first Google result:  http://www.herongyang.com/CD-DVD/Tools-vStrip-Demux-Separate-VOB-Streams.html  Never used vStrip
[09:45:00] <alphamule> I'm thinking there's similar options for FFMPEG
[09:45:14] <alphamule> Just got to figure out which demuxer to use
[09:45:24] <furq> there aren't
[09:45:35] <furq> you need to use a separate tool
[09:45:45] <furq> i use tccat on *nix but a bunch of distros stopped packaging it
[09:45:56] <furq> or pgcdemux on windows
[09:46:39] <furq> never heard of vstrip before but it looks like it's windows only anyway
[09:47:23] <alphamule> I see several examples on search results using ffmpeg, but not sure if they transcode or copy streams.
[09:47:47] <alphamule> Yeah, I guess you need to demux them separately
[09:47:50] <furq> ffmpeg can't do anything with ifos
[09:48:08] <furq> it can remux vobs just fine but vobs don't necessarily correspond to titles
[09:49:53] <Agafnd> maybe i should try handbrake.....
[09:50:14] <alphamule> Yeah, so you'd get videos you'd have to figure out where chapters/titles start
[09:50:20] <alphamule> ffmpeg -i your_VOB_file.VOB -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4
[09:50:29] <alphamule> That was search result btw
[09:50:44] <alphamule> Those options make sense.
[09:50:45] <Agafnd> Yeah see that doesn't work with this DVD
[09:50:53] <furq> tccat was nice because it would literally just dump the title to stdout
[09:50:56] <furq> so no need for a temporary file
[09:50:58] <alphamule> Let me guess:  'complex' vobs??
[09:51:09] <furq> i guess it still is nice but you'd have to build it yourself now
[09:51:28] <furq> dvdbackup also works on *nix but it has to write a temp file
[09:51:47] <alphamule> With amount of RAM on my desktop, I could just use ramfs?  XD
[09:51:54] <alphamule> Or whatever it's called
[09:51:57] <furq> tmpfs
[09:51:59] <furq> and sure
[09:52:17] <alphamule> I was thinking of Android I think
[09:52:18] <Agafnd> https://bpa.st/YMMQ
[09:52:21] <furq> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/dvdbackup#A_single_title
[09:52:22] <alphamule> That name
[09:53:17] <furq> can you remux with handbrake nowadays
[09:53:21] <alphamule> https://superuser.com/questions/227772/lossless-vob-conversion-with-ffmpeg  Anyways, this is where I shameless stole that example
[09:53:22] <furq> last time i checked in on it you could only encode
[09:53:39] <furq> and not particularly well
[09:54:57] <alphamule> Encrypted titles aren't going to demux, anyways.
[09:55:21] <Agafnd> that's probably the problem here
[09:55:31] <furq> ffmpeg wouldn't get that far if it was encrypted
[09:55:38] <alphamule> Yeah :/
[09:55:39] <furq> also dvdbackup will work if you have libdvdcss installed
[09:55:49] <Agafnd> well ffmpeg wasn't able to do anything until i played it in vlc
[09:55:51] <alphamule> Just read it
[09:55:57] <Agafnd> which presumably did some libdvdcss magic to it
[09:55:58] <alphamule> Definitely not encrypted
[09:56:12] <alphamule> It sounds like it's not finding the magic bytes it wants for DVD
[09:57:23] <alphamule> I used to use programs like DVD Decryptor for this sort of stuff
[09:57:36] <alphamule> Let me rip a specific stream
[09:57:44] <alphamule> Create a new VOB
[09:57:58] <alphamule> But I played them directly in VLC

[10:02:51] <Agafnd> hm i'm using dvdbackup & already this is looking more promising because ffprobe can actually tell what video codec VTS_01_1.VOB uses
[10:04:31] <Agafnd> so maybe i'll be able to do something with that...
[10:05:07] <alphamule> There was this neat concept of layered applications processing things
[10:05:18] <alphamule> Like that stdoutput example
[10:05:45] <alphamule> C++ has streams built in, but you'd need to use the right abstractions
[10:06:48] <alphamule> It's also possible to do such things with networking software.  IT's not a new idea.  :P
[10:07:20] <alphamule> I think they used the term "named device"?

[10:07:54] <alphamule> You create a POSIX-style device in most OSes, and you can have it actually be some program's input or output.
[10:08:14] <alphamule> Technically, its other way around, right?
[10:08:38] <alphamule> All physical devices like sdd are just handles for the device driver?

[15:04:28] <yjosephides> Hey guys, I'm about to release a commercial app on Google Play and I'm a bit confused on LGPLv2.1. I've read a lot online, some point to one direction some to another. Also, I've read through the official legal page of FFmpeg but things are still not clear. For the app, I basically use FFmpeg for 1. muxing mp4 videos and 2. extracting mp4 frames

[20:41:44] <yjosephides> Illya cool! Thanx for the clarification!
[20:42:01] <yjosephides> JEEB wow! yeah, definitely don't want that! Thanx
[20:42:36] <JEEB> technically the idea of LGPL is that you have to make it possible for someone to build that same version of the LGPL library, and then replace it
[20:43:43] <JEEB> so if you have a libav*.so file in  your APK that you're utilizing, if the user can build the same version (which is why you need to share the sources you utilized for the LGPL dep) and then put extract and re-package the APK

[20:44:07] <JEEB> and run the application with that, then LGPL is OK
[20:44:27] <yjosephides> JEEB but how can they be able to replace dynamic linked library in a package sold on Google Play?
[20:45:04] <JEEB> I would expect that to be a case of 1) extract APK 2) replace SOfile 3) re-pack the APK
[20:45:17] <JEEB> of course it will no longer be signed by you

[20:47:24] <JEEB> 2.1 IIRC is more permissive but generally it's good to keep in mind what LGPL generally had as an idea
[20:48:40] <yjosephides> So, LGPLv2.1, mention credits about page, link dynamically and have source code of the version of FFmpeg I used available on request
[20:49:41] <JEEB> well, technically the source code is there just to enable the user to replace the library :)
[20:51:04] <yjosephides> JEEB Cool! thanx so much for the clarification. Community doesn't stop to amaze me. you guys are awesome
[20:52:00] <JEEB> but yea, if you provide all the necessary source code so that the LGPL component can be rebuilt and replaced, that I think should be a pretty good starting point.
[20:52:05] <JEEB> if your build is LGPL
[20:52:18] <JEEB> as I said, before releasing anything, be very careful with the configuration
[20:53:07] <JEEB> don't enable GPL features unless you want to be GPL, same for version3 unless features behind that flag are required/wanted.
[20:54:45] <yjosephides> Got you, yeah I made sure to stay off h264 h265. I'll check for removing version3
[20:58:57] <JEEB> H.264 and H.265 decoding are part of standard LGPL setup
[20:59:04] <JEEB> there your only possible issues are with patent licensing
[20:59:14] <JEEB> which is 100% separate from FFmpeg's software licensing :)

[23:51:05] <Anubis169> hihi all, little stuck and need a hand :)
[23:51:17] <Anubis169> the problem (long text incoming):
[23:52:30] <Anubis169> finally managed to set up this VHS capture rig, got everything working but ffmpeg dropped a few frames on the VHS capture which led to audio/video desync. These recordings don't particularly need to look good, and I have a log of which frames were dropped from the capture output.
[23:52:53] <Anubis169> note: the recordings are ooooooooold, so framedrop is expected
[23:53:28] <Anubis169> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55496905/insert-frames-into-video-using-ffmpeg <-- did some googling and found this, as a method to create new timestamps and duplicate a frame here and there when needed
[23:53:49] <Anubis169> however that command in there doesn't work... i've tweaked it to no avail...
[23:54:56] <Anubis169> anybody got any ideas on how to, if i feed ffmpeg a list of dropped frame numbers, insert a duplicate of one-frame-before?
[23:55:35] <Anubis169> current version of ffmpeg is the nightly snapshot from less than a week ago
