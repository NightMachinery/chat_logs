[17:45:11] <alyx> BW laser printer is convenient to have

[17:45:22] <gerikson> got any good reccos alyx ?
[17:48:24] <alyx> honestly can't go wrong with most of the big name printer brands for laser tbh imo; I have https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-laserjet-pro-m15w-printer which is literally the cheapest laser printer HP sells, and it's been solid for my "once a quarter printing" for about 4 years now or so.
[17:50:09] <alyx> going up in price does get more features (e.g. "do you want scanning?", "do you want COLOUR?" etc.) but ime for laser it's a lot more "what features" than "what unit quality" since they're all basically built to be stuffed into an office and abused for years
[17:51:39] <kirch> my canon printer/scanner got a terminal paper jam and has decided nothin in the universe will convince it there's no more paper jam... like, it sent a test print through once since then, but every other time it's "I'm a big dummy, and I think I'm jammed"
[17:51:57] <Brekkjern> I think I get an actual document in paper form about twice a year, and I can't remember the last time I needed something in paper form
[17:53:26] <kirch> yeah - I need to print things like, once or twice a year - and I think at this point it's easier to just have Kinkos/whatever do it than to own an $80 device that works once.
