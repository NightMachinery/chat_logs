[14:58:53] <Guest77> This will put you in a detatched head state.  To keep the commit permanently, either tag it `git tag keepMe 549699d578ce05664ebb5` or make a branch at the commit location.
[14:59:45] <Guest77> To make a branch: `git branch branchName 549699d578ce05664ebb5`  to both checkout the commit and make a branch `git checkout -b branchName 549699d578ce05664ebb`

[15:05:30] <Guest77> shailangsa  Also, if I had to take a guess, the only thing missing from your second pastebin is your commit at HEAD (ie checked out).  Is it possible that android studio just doesn't show the latest commit?

[15:08:35] <shailangsa> im a bit confused, because i made several commits, but when i use android studio's "reset branch to here" i can no longer see any more recent commits shown in git log https://prnt.sc/_7ntffym_CMN ?
[15:09:18] *** Joins: csm3105 (~csm3105@143.red-83-48-84.staticip.rima-tde.net)
[15:10:49] <Guest77> Ok so `reset` in git essentially means "delete".  `reset my branch` is like saying "take the pointer to where I currently am, and rewind/move back in history to commit X" git will then forget everything that came _after_ commit X
[15:11:36] <shailangsa> thought it meant revert to that commit but dont delete anything?
[15:13:51] <Guest77> I'm not familiar with android studio, but in git reset does what I stated above.  There is some good news though because git doesn't immediately delete these comments.
[15:14:36] <shailangsa> is that why i can still checkout the commit even though its not shown in git log anymore?
[15:15:46] <Guest77> Yes. Roughly speaking, any commits that are not a) tagged or b) reachable by a branch are considered dangling commits.  git periodically deletes them as part of its garbage collection process but it doesn't happen right away
[15:16:51] <Guest77> So by "rewinding" your branch, you leave your previous commits dangling, meaning they won't show up in  the log and will eventually be deleted.  But if you check them out again and either add a tag or a branch then they will no longer be danging and will be preserved
[15:17:46] <Guest77> You can also do a fast-forward merge to move your `reset` branch back to where it used to be.
[15:17:59] <shailangsa> is there anyway to find out what those commit hashes were?

[15:19:19] <gitinfo> The git reflog (`git log -g`) temporarily (90 days by default) snapshots your branch states at each operation that changes the branch, making it easy to undo e.g. merges and rebases. The usual warnings about !rewriting/undoing history apply. See https://sukima.github.io/GitFixUm/ for full details.

[15:32:38] <Guest77> !reset
[15:32:38] <gitinfo> reset does two things! (1) without file/path argument: 'git reset [flags] [<commit>]' = make the current branch point to <commit> (default: HEAD). --soft = don't do anything else. --mixed (default) = overwrite the index to match. --hard = overwrite the working files to match. (2) 'git reset [<commit>] -- <path>' = overwrite the index entries for <path> with the content from <commit> (default: HEAD)

[15:32:59] <Guest77> !checkout
[15:32:59] <gitinfo> checkout does two different things! (1) no file/path argument: 'git checkout <ref>' = switches to a branch or commit. Uncommitted changes are carried over; if they don't apply cleanly the whole operation rolls back. (2) 'git checkout [<commit>] -- <path>' = overwrites the given files/paths with different versions, from <commit> or (if not given) from the index.

[15:35:06] <Guest77> So reset moves the *branch* while checkout moves *HEAD*.  If you move the branch you lose whatever you leave behind. If you move HEAD you are fine because HEAD is just what you are currently looking at (and is often set to a branch)

[15:39:52] <Guest77> You have two options
[15:41:05] <Guest77> One: You want the commits on your master branch.  `git checkout master` then `git reset --hard 0a4411c` will do it.  (a rare case of using reset to fast-forward rather than rewind history)
[15:41:51] <Guest77> Two: you want to keep them but not as part of master.  `git checkout -b branchName 0a4411c`

[16:21:13] <Guest77> shailangsa So it looks like you are not currently on the master branch.
[16:22:07] <Guest77> Checkout would switch you over to the master branch.  This will remove any uncommitted work (and usually yells at you if there is some).
[16:22:46] <Guest77> Rebasing is kind of like merging, so that is a very different operation.
[16:23:26] <Guest77> I highly recommend you work through some of the exercises at: https://learngitbranching.js.org/
[16:24:40] <Guest77> The first 4 lessons are very quick ("Introduction sequence") and will teach you about merge and rebase
[16:24:52] <shailangsa> do you mainly work on the master branch?
[16:25:17] <Guest77> Working through all the examples on that site was incredibly helpful and is a big part of how I learned git

[16:49:08] <shailangsa> trying to do the equivalent of git reset --hard d7575f1 in android studio to save the most recent commit to the master branch, is it possible to do it using the android studio interface https://prnt.sc/LzWdqCjLZNG3 ?
[16:53:19] <Guest77> Not that I am seeing from your screenshot. So the short answer would be no
[16:55:13] <Guest77> Although interactively rebase from here might work

[16:55:53] <Guest77> The long answer is  It looks like you are in a detached HEAD state (head is pointing directly at a commit instead of a branch (which would then point at a commit)).  Detatched head is not good because nothing is getting saved to a branch.  (if you move head off the current commit you are going to have the same sort of dangling commit situation
[16:55:54] <Guest77> you just had).  If you are doing work you *always* should be on a branch.
[16:56:09] *** Joins: fdan (~fdan@103.215.168.1)
[16:56:51] <shailangsa> it seems rebase is not allowed https://prnt.sc/gj_VvLJAkqeM
[16:57:02] <Guest77> If you were on a branch, I imagine android studio would show an option to merge your work back into master which is what you essentially want to do (a fast-forward merge, which git usually is smart enough to figure out)
[16:59:46] <Guest77> Actually I might have been mistaken.  If you click on the latest commit and select "reset branch to here" I think that might work.
[17:01:02] <Guest77> Otherwise, make a branch at that commit with "newbranch" and then see if it will let you merge that branch into master
[17:01:41] <Guest77> From then on always work on a branch.  Either checkout master or checkout/make a new branch before you make commits.

[18:39:38] *** Quits: RiFo (~RiFo@user/rifo) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[18:39:39] <CarloWood> At least changes in all files that were reverted.
[18:39:43] <FreeBDSM> I probably didn't have them
[18:41:24] <CarloWood> I think git revert  just copies all files that were changed from the specified commit (HEAD in this case) and then commits the changes that are the result of that. So, I'd expect that resetting one commit would be enough.
[18:41:43] <CarloWood> gitk  is your friend to get an overview of the repro :)

[22:37:42] <mehwork> if i have 3 commits in my branch and i want to squash down to 1, vim as my rebase -i tool let's me put 's' next to the top 2 commits to do it.  However, if VSCode is my merge tool it only let's me squash one of them. Is that a bug or desired behavior?
[22:38:25] <imMute> mehwork: that's a limitation of VS Code, not a git thing.  (and you make the first commit 'p' and the next 2 's' if you didn't know that already)
[22:39:28] <mehwork> right, i have 3 commits like:  initial commit, second commit, 3rd commit
[22:39:44] <mehwork> and if i try to put 's' next to 3rd it works, but won't let me put it next to second
[22:40:08] <mehwork> yet vim let's me
[22:40:28] <mehwork> infernix: any idea why VS Code limits it?

[22:47:32] <imMute> not a clue, I don't use VS Code's git integration

[23:14:12] <mehwork> yeah i'm still iffy about trusting it more than the cli for a lot of tasks, so i bounce back and forth
[23:14:35] <mehwork> especially anything git related since it's too important to screw up

[23:15:12] <mehwork> but it does have some conveniences like just using the IDE's automatic git status, where you can click and stage each file individually
[23:15:36] <mehwork> i like that for diffing before committing one last time, whereas 'git diff' is annoying on the cli because it shows package-lock.json which has a TON of content i don't need to see the diff of
[23:15:50] <mehwork> there's ways to exclude files on the cli but it's too annoying the pattern you have to write last i checked

[23:16:37] <Gamah> but you can tell git diff to open in VS
[23:17:01] <Gamah> which is a completely different (and way better) experience than trying to understand whatever the actual fuck vs thinks it's doing with it's staged changes tab or whatever it's called
