[01:19:09] <carlino3> how would you solve this? http://mathb.in/70385
[01:20:02] <enthdegree> say sigma(X) is the sigma algebra for X and E1, E2 are events. now is sigma(X|E1\cap E2) well-defined in terms of sigma(X|E1) and sigma(X|E2)?

[01:20:36] <enthdegree> A negative answer would be that to construct sigma(X|E1 \cap E2) one would need (E1\cap E2) and sigma(X)

In fact there exist a "proof" of Fermat last theorem in a specific case, but it uses the fact that all ring of integers are UFD (Or at least cyclotomic ring of integers) .... which is wrong. Therefore, to adapt it, he introduced what he called "Ideal numbers"
[12:33:48] <moon-child> evidlo: yes.  Just multiply by N
[12:34:11] <Pollion> Which lead to the modern definition of fractional ideal and class group theory in Dedekind domains
[12:35:33] <moon-child> evidlo: (or, for that matter, multiply by 0!)
[12:36:21] <moon-child> (since N is the same as 0, modulo N.  You can do it without multiplying by 0 iff you have common factors with N)
[12:37:10] <Pollion> bollu: riv And about DVR, they are not really a generalization of p-adics in the sense that one of the most important thing in p-adics is the completion ... which is not needed for DVR. Z_p is a DVR, for sure, but there are many more which are in some sense "smaller" (Not complete, countable etc... Recall that Z_p is uncountable).
[12:37:43] <Pollion> They arise naturally when working with localization, which is a concept that might be more understood in geometry.
[12:38:25] <bollu> Pollion do you mind going into the relationship between localization and DVRs?
[12:38:38] <bollu> I think of localization as a formal way to invert certain elements of the ring
[12:38:48] <bollu> and I vaguely know that it's like concentrating attention at a prime (point)
[12:40:00] <Pollion> Yes, exactly. Localization is more general as you point out. For instance you can think of the construction of the fraction field of an integral domain as a localization that make every non zero element formally invertible.

[12:43:27] <Pollion> In a localization at a P, there is only one prime ideal, which is precisely P.

[12:48:45] <Pollion> Localization is a very useful construction to study rings and modules over a ring.
[12:49:46] <Pollion> Many properties are local, meaning that they hold globally on the whole ring/module whenever they hold on localization at every prime ideal, and they are somewhat easier to prove in local rings.

[12:59:14] <bollu> Right. I wonder if zariski based topology of Spec(R) and the metric based topology of the DVR at a prime interact.
[12:59:46] <Pollion> In the same way as you can define p-adic valuations in Q by v(a/b) = v(a)-v(b) you can also extend valuations to number fields
[13:00:27] <Pollion> When you complete a number field with respect to this valuation, you get a class of fields called "Local fields" (Actually there are other local fields arising from geometry)
[13:00:56] <bollu> I see
[13:01:02] <bollu> so the p-adics are a local field, then?
[13:01:14] <bollu> what are the other local fields?
[13:01:22] <Pollion> In local fields there exist one distinguish ring called ring of integers of the local field, which are complete DVR

[13:02:37] <bollu> [why do we need to live in a local field to define the ring of integers?]
[13:02:43] <Pollion> In local field you have another definition

[13:06:40] <bollu> I need to think about this. Let's consider Q_3. The valuation tells us what power of `3` divides a number in `Q_3` has, right?

[13:08:40] <Pollion> In local fields, take O_K to be the ring of integers, which is a local ring. Take m the unique maximal ideal. Then O_K/m is a field by definition. In my definition of local field I ask this field to be a finite field.
[13:09:09] <bollu> Pollion can I go the other direction? If I have an O_K, is the local field the field of fractions of this O_K?

[13:09:37] <bollu> Pollion but, by the definition in terms of valuation: what is the valuation of `5` in `Q_3`?
[13:09:44] <Pollion> euh forget my last sentence
[13:09:57] <Pollion> ring of integers of Q_3 is Z_3 yes.
[13:10:23] <Pollion> The valuation of 5 is 0, my mistake
[13:10:41] <Pollion> In particular its absolute value is 1
[13:10:46] <bollu> right :)
[13:10:59] <Pollion> The unit circle represent the invertible elements.
[13:11:05] <Pollion> 9 is of valuation 2
[13:11:12] <bollu> right
[13:11:14] <Pollion> So absolute value 3^(-2)
[13:11:20] <Pollion> which is <= 1
[13:11:29] <Pollion> In fact Z \subset Z_3
[13:11:39] <Pollion> So every integer is actually an integer in Q_3
[13:11:39] <bollu> Pollion I can see why every unit would have valuation 1. Going the other way round seems harder to me: how do I prove that everything with valuation 1 has a multiplicative inverse?
[13:12:16] <Pollion> You can prove that every element in Q_3 can be factored as 3^k*u where u is invertible
[13:12:22] *** Quits: econo (uid147250@user/econo) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[13:12:39] <Pollion> In particular, elements of valuation 0 are factored as 3^0*u = u and are invertible.
[13:14:04] <Pollion> So p-adics, and more generally completion of number fields with respect to a non archimedian absolute value, are local fields in characteristics 0.
[13:14:24] <Pollion> In positive characteristics, you have the fields of Laurent series with coefficients in a finite field.
[13:15:00] <bollu> I see
[13:15:27] <bollu> I have another question: what is ramification?
[13:15:40] <bollu> I'm quite excited to get to the idea. I was hoping you could give me a sneak preview :)
[13:15:55] <Pollion> ie formal power series, but you allow a *finite* number of negative index: sum_{n>-N} a_nX^n
[13:16:24] <Pollion> And the ring of integers is the set of usual formal power series.
[13:16:36] <Pollion> Ok, ramification is a little bit more complicated to handle.
[13:16:51] <Pollion> There is a quite simple definition
[13:16:55] *** Joins: andreasbuhr (~quassel@p549db796.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[13:17:03] <Pollion> but the idea behind may be a little bit more tricky.
[13:17:15] <Pollion> Take your favorite dedekind domain.
[13:17:19] <bollu> mmhm
[13:17:30] <Pollion> For instance, consider K a number field
[13:17:40] <Pollion> and O_K the ring of integers.
[13:17:54] <Pollion> Then take a prime p in Z.
[13:18:06] <Pollion> Since Z \subset O_K, p can be considered as an element of O_K, right ?
[13:18:11] <bollu> yes
[13:18:42] <Pollion> Ok. p is prime in Z, meaning that the ideal (p) = pZ is a prime ideal of Z.
[13:18:50] <bollu> yep
[13:18:54] <Pollion> Consider now this ideal, but in O_K
[13:18:58] <bollu> right
[13:19:00] <Pollion> ie the ideal pO_K
[13:19:08] *** kish is now known as kish`
[13:19:08] <bollu> yes
[13:19:09] <Pollion> It may not be prime anymore
[13:19:12] <bollu> mmhm
[13:19:52] <Pollion> So it factors as a product of prime ideals *of O_K*
[13:20:10] <Pollion> pO_K = P_1^e_1....P_r^e_r
[13:20:23] <Pollion> where P_i are distinct prime ideals of O_K.
[13:20:27] <bollu> yes
[13:20:53] <Pollion> You say that p ramifies in O_K (or in K) when there is some e_i which is > 1
[13:21:01] <Pollion> Example
[13:21:58] <Pollion> Take Z[i], the ring of Gauss integers.

[13:23:05] *** Joins: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts)
[13:23:11] <Pollion> Yes.
[13:23:15] <Pollion> But in fact
[13:23:25] <Pollion> The ideal (1-i) = (1+i) (as ideals)
[13:23:31] <Pollion> So (2) = (1+i)^2
[13:23:46] <Pollion> And you can prove that (1+i) is a prime ideal in Z[i]
[13:23:48] <bollu> is it because (1 - i)i = i + 1 = 1 + i?
[13:24:01] <Pollion> Yes
[13:24:12] <bollu> very cool
[13:24:22] <Pollion> Therefore, (2) ramifies in Z[i].
[13:24:46] <bollu> is it prime because the quotient Z[i]/(1 - i) ~= Z is an integral domain? [the quotient tells us to make 1 - i = 0, or to set i = ]
[13:24:51] <Pollion> But you can also prove that primes that ramify are not really common
[13:24:53] <bollu> it = (1 - i)
[13:25:05] <Pollion> In fact, 2 is the *only* prime that ramifies in Z[i]
[13:25:20] <Pollion> More generally, you only have a finite number of primes that ramify
[13:25:50] <bollu> in any O_K?
[13:25:53] <Pollion> Yes
[13:26:15] <bollu> I see
[13:26:21] <Pollion> You can define a quantity called the Discriminant of K which I won't define.
[13:26:50] <Pollion> Or more generally, Discriminant of an extension K/L
[13:27:08] <Pollion> The primes of L that ramify in K are precisely primes that divide the discriminant.
[13:28:04] <bollu> I see

[13:48:18] <Pollion> For local rings, ramification is interesting because remember that O_k/m is a finite field.
[13:48:32] <Pollion> Now take an extension O_L.
[13:48:45] <Pollion> If m doesn't ramify, then m stays prime in O_L

[17:23:14] <Pollion> There are plenty of links between ANT and Elliptic Curves. But, for a crypto perspective, you don't really need ANT to understand ECC crypto. You are "only" working with ECC over finite fields.
[17:24:30] <Pollion> ANT comes when you are looking at efficient algorithms to factorize integers, or compute discrete logs and break those cryptosystems. Nowadays the most efficient algorithms are variants of the Number Field Sieve https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve
[17:24:59] <Pollion> Another application of ANT in crypto which I had in mind when I told you that, is for what is called post quantum cryptography.
[17:25:53] <Pollion> Meaning crypto that resists attacks using quantum computers.

[19:05:17] <Galois> for complex multiplication, you need a big chunk of class field theory
[19:05:33] <Galois> the supersingular stuff uses quaternion algebras
[19:06:34] <Galois> it's not "just" characteristic p, because you need to go back and forth between finite fields and complex numbers / p-adics to get anything nontrivial done, and isogeny cryptography does use the nontrivial stuff

(is it true that one contains more info than the

[21:19:08] <zacts> but it seems to be more than just that

[21:22:51] <zacts> I definitely want to get specific and accurate with solving problems.

[21:24:48] <zacts> ski: I'd definitely be interested
[21:25:05] <tusko> a + b mod c  , a,b,c \in Z always produces an integer, for example. Also, that integer belongs to one of n equivalence classes.
[21:25:36] <ski> "working `mod 11'" basically means that instead of doing equalities like ⌜⋯ = ⋯⌝, you're doing congruences like ⌜⋯ ≡ ⋯ (mod 11)⌝ (which is very different from (although related to) the programming "modulo/remainder" stuff, like ⌜⋯ = (⋯ mod 11)⌝ (often `%' is used in place of `mod' or `rem')). e.g. ⌜−8 ≡ 14 (mod 11)⌝ is true
[21:27:27] *** Quits: twoisprime (~twoisprim@user/twoisprime) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[21:28:48] <ski> more abstractly, it means that instead of working with the set of integers, ⌜ℤ⌝, you're working with the set of "integers modulo 11", ⌜ℤ ∕ (11⋅ℤ)⌝. so, instead of ⌜−8 ≡ 14 (mod 11)⌝, you could say ⌜[−8]₁₁ = [14]₁₁⌝ (reverting back from the modulo/congruence equivalence relation to ordinary equality) or just ⌜[−8] = [14]⌝ (taking ⌜11⌝ for granted in the
[21:28:54] <ski> context), or even just ⌜−8 = 14⌝ (with the understanding that you're not talking about plain ordinary integers, but rather about the "integers modulo 11" in ⌜ℤ ∕ (11⋅ℤ)⌝
[21:29:17] <ski> btw, personally i often write, instead of ⌜−8 ≡ 14 (mod 11)⌝ :
[21:29:36] <ski>      11
[21:29:37] <ski>   −8  ≅ 14
[21:29:45] <zacts> it opens up the arithmetic so that you don't have just a single integer solution for x but a class of integers that could satisfy x.

[21:45:45] <zacts> well first let me figure out what class 7 and 5 are in
[21:45:48] <zacts> classes
[21:46:00] <sek> aquery: the ring structure is given by cup product. It exists in quite big generality (certainly for compact manifolds) and you can read about it in eg Hatcher's Algebraic Topology book. It puts a ring structures on the cohomology ring H^*(X). I think ring structures on the homology of a manifold are less interesting, but if you're working with (co)homology over a field, then the two vector spaces are dual and
[21:46:06] <sek> everything is the same. If you insist on working, eg ...
[21:46:09] <sek> ... with Z the integers and singular homology, then you can look up the universal coefficient theorem to understand the relation between homology and cohomology
[21:46:38] <riv> [5] = {...,-28,-17,-6,5,16,27,38,...}
[21:46:51] <zacts> 5 is in the same class as 4 more than 11
[21:47:08] <Z-module> There *are* ring structures for homology? Must be very special situations, right?
[21:47:15] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)

[21:48:55] <riv> 4 is not in it
[21:49:02] <zacts> 4 more than a multiple of 11
[21:49:02] *** Joins: bourfronti (~main@user/bourfronti)
[21:50:12] <zacts> oh
[21:50:17] <zacts> 7 + 11 = 18

[21:50:48] <zacts> |7| = { ..., -25, -18, 7, 18, 25, ... } is this correct?
[21:51:03] <zacts> you just add 11 to 7, and 11 to that, and 11 to that
[21:51:08] <aquery> Z-module: indeed. One needs a continuous multiplication on the space
[21:51:25] <riv> good zacts
[21:51:30] <aquery> sek: many thanks!
[21:51:54] <riv> [7] = {...,-26,-15,-4,7,18,29,40,...}
[21:52:13] <zacts> oops
[21:52:14] <zacts> yeah
[21:52:46] <riv> so the goal is to find 7 * something = 5 or 16 or 27 or 38 or ..
[21:52:58] <riv> all of these numbers are considered the same, mod 11
[21:54:04] <zacts> so the number from |7| must be smaller than the number from |5|
[21:54:35] <zacts> so perhaps one strategy might be to try a larger number from |5| that I can divide by 7
[21:55:07] <riv> exactly
[21:55:16] <zacts> 49
[21:55:21] <tusko> or 49, since 49-44=5
[21:55:27] <tusko> yeah that's a solution
[21:55:31] <riv> well done
[21:55:36] <tusko> 18 also
[21:55:41] <riv> so specifically
[21:55:43] <riv> 7*7 = 5  mod 11
[21:56:00] <zacts> so the final solution should probably be the smallest number from within that class
[21:56:01] <tusko> 7*18=126 and 126%11=5
[21:56:07] <riv> now normally, 1, 4, 9, 25, 36, .. are the square numbers
[21:56:33] <zacts> riv: ok
[21:56:37] <riv> but mod 11, we have seen that '5' is a square number
[21:56:51] <riv> the square numbers mod 11 are: 1,4,9,5,3
