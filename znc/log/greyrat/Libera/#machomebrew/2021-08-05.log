[01:02:24] <bn_work> hmm, I tried to install the --HEAD version but it wants me to first update xcode but there is no install option in the App Store, what gives?

[06:59:10] <mrec> ok there seems to be a bug in homebrew
[06:59:17] <mrec> url "https://code.qt.io/cgit/pyside/pyside-setup.git/tag/?h=v5.15.2", using: :git, branch: "5.15.2"

[07:00:08] <mrec> the slash at the end should not be there
[07:13:40] <mrec> ok not homebrew is defect the package is not ok
[07:13:53] <mrec> works now after removing ?h=v5.15.2
[07:34:21] <mrec> is there a way to check which project /usr/local/opt/med-file/lib/libmedfwrap.11.0.0.dylib belongs to?
[07:34:41] <mrec> something like apt-file
[07:42:47] <tdsmith> If it’s in med-file’s prefix (opt/med-file) it must have been installed by med-file
[07:44:02] <mrec> I have libmed installed and I don't know where it comes from
[07:44:10] <mrec> and it's outdated
[07:44:21] <mrec> and freecad needs it but it doesn't seem to come from the freecad sourcetree
[07:44:55] <mrec> tdsmith: oh med-file really thanks
[07:45:29] <mrec> trying brew reinstall freecad/freecad/med-file -s
[07:45:50] <mrec> hopefully it will resolve the wrong linkage
[07:54:12] <mrec> thatdid it
[07:54:14] <mrec> that did it
[07:58:53] <mrec> and the freecad error is gone
