[00:45:52] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Is there a way to pass a function call to a macro? E.g. I want to do myMacro(foo(123)) but I don't want foo(123) evaluated and passed in as a value, I want the macro to be able to invoke foo(123)
[00:47:05] <FromDiscord> <planetis> you need a typed macro then call getTypeImpl on x and loop over the enum type's ast

[01:29:01] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Zevv: Idea - Could NPeg be used to pattern match and process ASTs from a Nim macro?
[01:30:34] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Prestige: I believe the macro should do that by default, as long as the type of the macro's parameter isn't static
[01:32:43] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> @Prestige can't you just pass the arguments to foo to the macro as well? like `@foo, 123`

[02:06:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Prestige you have to make the parameter `typed`
[02:07:14] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Zevv: Hm, true. Hypothetically, do you think something like tree traversal and validation could be implemented as a (viable) PEG-like DSL?
[02:07:23] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> (edit) "(viable)" => "(useful)"
[02:07:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Something like this prestige https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3z5P
[02:08:22] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> Woah, that's... interesting. Typing a SED subtitution pattern into Discord performs an edit on the previous message.

[02:09:38] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's secret
[02:09:38] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> O_o
[02:09:45] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> @Beef, you don't need the outer brackets, and `typed` can be `untyped`
[02:09:45] <nrds> <06Prestige99> @Elegantbeef thanks btw
[02:10:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Typed can be untyped but it's better if it's typed since the symbol is looked up so you can do stuff with it if you wish
[02:10:29] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Instead of emitting `0.0` you can do `default(returnT)`
[02:11:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> otherwise you have to use `typeof(`foo`)` and have 0 introspection
[02:11:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Like since it's typed you can check if it can raise and if not error
[02:11:37] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Yeah I still need to figure out how to make this macro
[02:13:15] <Zevv> Varriount: I don't know. The theory behind PEG is pretty strong, pages full of math scribbles and all that shit
[02:13:46] <Zevv> I dont understand jack about the theory, so I have no clue if this could somehow map to parsing an AST
[02:14:57] <Zevv> my hunch is that it /could/ work though; the grammar is basically a recursive tree itself, and it typically already parses recursive things
[02:15:06] <nrds> <06Prestige99> so using `foo` in the macro actually runs the proc... interesting
[02:15:14] <nrds> <06Prestige99> instead of foo()
[02:15:15] <Zevv> because this seq[T] you feed it already contains tree-like things.
[02:15:29] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well you're emitting the call
[02:15:30] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> vs calling the symbol
[02:15:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> the backticks in the quote emit the code you passed
[02:15:49] <nrds> <06Prestige99> ah okay
[02:16:17] <nrds> <06Prestige99> last thing is, I need to get the type `foo` returns so I can use default(theType)
[02:17:37] <nrds> <06Prestige99> or can I just use default(typeof(`foo`)) here, seems to work 
[02:19:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You could
[02:19:09] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3z5S
[02:19:16] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Is a good reference impl
[02:19:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Might not work with generics but i'll leave that to you to implement üòõ
[02:20:18] <nrds> <06Prestige99> oh you just used impl.params[0] instead? Any benefit there?
[02:20:34] <nrds> <06Prestige99> maybe less overhead
[02:20:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Nah
[02:21:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's the same thing really, just one will say `typeOf(foo(args))` if it ever errors vs `yourReturnType`
[02:22:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Atleast i think it will
[02:22:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Unlikely it'll error but yea
[02:22:58] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Mostly just did that + the raise lists stuff to show why you'd want to use `typed`
[02:23:04] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Just to really annoy ynfle üòõ
[02:23:18] <nrds> <06Prestige99> ah
[02:28:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Also why so lame and using `@` when you could use `?`
[02:28:54] <nrds> <06Prestige99> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3z5V I think this is good enough for my use
[02:29:08] <nrds> <06Prestige99> like ?(foo(123)) ? idk looks weird to me
[02:29:20] <nrds> <06Prestige99> maybe shouldn't use @ though
[02:29:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> But but... you dont get a CT error when using it stupidly
[02:29:48] <nrds> <06Prestige99> oh?
[02:30:03] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Because of the check you did for raises?
[02:30:10] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea

[02:36:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea it's nice part of macros to give useful error messages CPS uses it a lot
[02:36:08] <nrds> <06Prestige99> oh that's cool

[13:33:44] <PMunch> Basically I have created a nice program that outputs a JSON definition of the C I give it. then I parse that JSON in Nim and generate Nim code
[13:33:55] <PMunch> But the program will also output warnings on stderr..

[13:36:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Eh the issue is the generated code
[13:36:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I mean yea use varargs or similar
[13:36:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> but the emitted code is doing `for x in []`

[13:37:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Though it errors in a different spot
[13:38:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> x in that for loop doesnt have a type which is why it says `empty`

[13:39:56] <FromDiscord> <fae> is there a way to retain the type information of it being a `seq[Hash]`
[13:40:15] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `newLit(hashes)` should work
[13:40:35] <FromDiscord> <fae> also, i feel like what I am currently trying to do would be a lot simpler if I could just create an `array[typedesc]` heh

[13:40:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `varargs[untyped]`
[13:40:54] <PMunch> @ElegantBeef, I can do `when defined(nimVM)` but then my macro doesn't see the module as imported..
