[19:58:49] <skeemer__> people any good book suggestion on 2d game dev techniques?
[19:59:12] <skeemer__> i would like to understand how to design games with different techniques... like horizontal/vertical platformers... doom like and so on...
[20:02:46] <technomancy> I wrote a blog post about a wolfenstein-style raycaster engine
[20:03:04] <technomancy> https://technomancy.us/193
[20:04:07] <technomancy> the core engine (just map, without sprites) ends up being only 43 lines
[20:29:38] <dto> hi skeemer__ hmm. i've been disappointed in most books about game dev. but if you want to know various 2d game designs, you could install an atari emulator such as Stella and play old 2d games
[20:30:31] <thrig> or look at the code for rogue (do not recommend)

[21:57:03] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[22:38:17] <peterhil> skeemer__: What makes the games come alive is the event loop:
[22:38:17] <peterhil> * Game Loop · Sequencing Patterns · Game Programming Patterns: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html
[22:38:17] <peterhil> * Fix Your Timestep! | Gaffer On Games: https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/
[22:39:23] <peterhil> Although fantasy consoles and many game engines provide you an event loop, so you do not have to implement one yourself.
[22:44:56] <peterhil> Regarding physical modeling and graphics, I highly recommend learning geometric algebra:
[22:44:56] <peterhil> https://geometricalgebra.org/plucker_coordinates.html
[22:44:56] <peterhil> https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/
[22:46:53] <peterhil> Geometric product in 2D is homomorphic to complex number plane, and easily and intuitively expands to 3, 4, 5, even more dimensions! It simplifies and makes intuitive many physical formulas, that otherwise require memorisation obscure and counterintuitive rules and formulas.
[22:47:39] <peterhil> As a disclaimer – I am myself learning both game development, and geometric algebra.
[22:57:21] <dthompson> that's probably overly complicated for a beginner
[22:59:24] <dthompson> I've been doing this for awhile and "geometric product in 2d is homomorphic to complex number plane" makes my eyes glaze over
[23:10:12] <borodust> smash buttons and make this thing game
[23:10:37] <borodust> ask questions occasionally

[23:15:26] <winning-luser> cepl seems cool but i dont know anything about opengl or GPU programming generally. any experienced opengl lispers have resources (books/videos/articles etc) they'd recommend reading?
[23:16:22] <borodust> winning-luser: do you specifically target opengl or do you just want to draw something on the screen?
[23:17:01] <winning-luser> borodust: the latter, i dont have any specific requirements. i just watched some baggers videos and thought it looked fun
[23:17:02] <peterhil> dthompson: You might be right, that GA is overly complicated. But it is good to know that an alternative exists to complex numbers, quaternions, linear algebra, matrices etc. that unites them all.
[23:17:59] <dthompson> winning-luser: for learning opengl, I like https://learnopengl.com/ 
[23:18:08] <peterhil> Yesterday someone wrote here, that game development is about cheting wherever you can in order to get the game ready. I think that was well said!
[23:18:25] <winning-luser> dthompson: thanks
[23:19:57] <borodust> winning-luser: what dthompson and if you prefer dead trees then opengl superbible was good when i checked at gl 2.1 times ;p
[23:20:37] <borodust> winning-luser: if you want to put something 2d on the screen fast you can check out Sketch or trivial-gamekit
[23:21:06] <borodust> but going through learnopengl with CEPL should be fun!
[23:21:11] <winning-luser> borodust: thanks for the recc as well
[23:21:18] <winning-luser> i have been tinkering with sketch for 2d
[23:21:24] <borodust> cool!
[23:21:41] <dthompson> if the goal is to understand opengl itself, I recommend using the opengl api directly.
[23:21:55] <dthompson> if you don't care, use whatever high-level library you can find
[23:22:05] <peterhil> skeemer__: I found some simple platformer demo, and found the source code helpful in understanding how start building some simple 2D game. I am not sure if was the one listed here, but there are lot’s of interesting things here to look at: https://tic80.com/play?cat=1&sort=2&page=2
[23:22:24] <peterhil> Fennel Lisp can be used with Tic-80.
[23:22:49] <skeemer__> i dont' understand whgat is this tic80
[23:22:56] <peterhil> https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Simple-Platformer-tutorial
[23:24:13] <winning-luser> i think at the moment id just like to get familiar with what opengl is, the concepts of it, and how to use it
[23:24:44] <winning-luser> think the reccs given to me will be appropriate, hopefully haha
[23:25:24] <peterhil> skeemer__: It is a fantasy (virtual) console with restricted specifications (16 colours, 240x136px screen, 4 channel sequencer, map tiles etc), that works on Mac, Linux and Windows, and on web:
[23:25:24] <peterhil> https://tic80.com/  (you can click on the games on the play section and try them out, and download the cartidge to see the source code, which is usually in Lua, but some games are written in Fennel Lisp)

[23:26:33] <peterhil> There is a very helpful community at #fennel channel in this same (Libera) IRC network.
[23:26:49] <skeemer__> peterhil, is there an offline tic80 emulator?or we depend on a website whichi could disappear from one day to the other?
[23:27:25] <technomancy> skeemer__: yeah the web version is just one way to play the games; normally you download the program
[23:27:38] <technomancy> but it's easier to see and demo stuff if that's not necessary
[23:28:42] <skeemer__> technomancy, but when you download it how do you play it? do you have an executable? which can run on linux? how can i plau with the cartridge?
[23:28:52] <peterhil> skeemer__: Yes, you can download a native app from here: https://tic80.com/create I recommend spending $5 on the Pro version, because it has cartridges in text format instead of binary, although you can enable the pro version when building from the sources: https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80#pro-version
[23:30:55] <technomancy> skeemer__: it's all explained on the site
[23:31:20] <peterhil> I have written an hexagonal map for Tic-80 in Fennel, and ported the demo-platformer to Fennel:

[23:33:31] <peterhil> I’ll fork the hexagonal map repository soon to participate on the Lisp Game Jam. I’ll be making a game of alchemy – I explained the idea on Twitter: https://twitter.com/peterhil/status/1450084190200938504
[23:36:35] <skeemer__> people is it possible to follow learnopengl.com but by using lisp?
