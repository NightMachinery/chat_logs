[01:11:00] <Orbstheorem> I think I may have accidentally entered '^D' (that is, ASCII 0x4) as part of a password...

[13:08:32] <Orbstheorem> Does anybody know if there's any reasonable editor (bonus points vim) where I can set the document language for spellcheck per paragraph and then pipe markdown to pandoc?

[14:40:44] <LucasCrijns[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Does anybody know if there's any..." <- Maybe not reasonable, but I think libreoffice allows spellcheck per paragraph and then you can either use pandoc on the odt file directly and use its formatting or write everything in plain text/markdown in libre office, then extract a txt file using pandoc, which can be interpreted as markdown. Then use pandoc again on the markdown
[14:41:09] <LucasCrijns[m]> I think libreoffice has editor emulation, so maybe you can use vim keybindings with an extension
[14:52:30] <Notkea> documents written in multiple langages are irratants

[15:45:29] <Orbstheorem> <LucasCrijns[m]> "I think libreoffice has editor..." <- Ooh, I should try this.
[15:45:45] <Orbstheorem> <Notkea> "documents written in multiple..." <- Why though?
[15:46:56] <Orbstheorem> I like languages outside computers and math.
[15:46:56] <Orbstheorem> And maybe science...
[16:05:23] <Notkea> I suppose you could treat those as snippets. Everything is going to be simpler in nvim once everything will have migrated to tree-sitter
[16:05:56] <Notkea> also, this is strange, I only received all the messages of the last hours just right now
[16:07:01] <Notkea> not related: is there a way to compile LaTeX documents safely? The language can be pretty expressive and documents may contain instructions to perform undesired computations, write files, etc…
[16:15:08] <typedef[m]1> Either you compile only a subset of the language (I don't know how to do that), or you use a VM/sandbox thing
[16:18:18] <Notkea> hmm… Apparently that set can be selected with `-no-shell-escape`, `-shell-restricted`, and `-shell-escape`. I'm not sure whether this is enough, as the name only implies restricting "shell" operations, whatever that means
