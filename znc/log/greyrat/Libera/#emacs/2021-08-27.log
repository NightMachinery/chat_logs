[00:05:33] <Bayes> grym sweet
[00:05:39] <bpalmer> makomo: the curl command line does support specifying multiple URLs/requests  with the --next parameter

[00:06:19] <Bayes> does it really reduce 32dB, as in "noise is 80, you get 32 protection, you hear about 50db"?
[00:06:31] <grym> averaged across frequency in a particular way, yes
[00:06:37] <alphapapa[m]> <makomo> "alphapapa: any ideas/thoughts on..." <- Well, I'd use a queue of some kind.  You can see in Chris Wellons's elfeed-curl library (which plz.el is loosely inspired by) how it uses a queue for some requests.  I haven't implemented anything like that in plz.el (yet?), but I'd guess I would use some kind of a pool/ring system to limit the number of simultaneous requests.
[00:06:41] <grym> the reduction per frequency is... there's a chart

[00:06:47] <Bayes> grym sweet
[00:06:58] <bpalmer> makomo: I don't know if the curl binary itself has something quite so server oriented (but , again, straightforward to code up as a small program that either links with libcurl or shells out to curl workers itself, which can limit how many extant processes there are)
[00:07:22] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: bpalmer: an important thing that i left out in the description of my use-case is that each next request depends on the response of the previous request, so you can't specify the urls over the command line as they might not even be known at that point
[00:07:29] <Bayes> grym yeah no worries, I mean I just wanted to get a feel if I could expect a relief as if it was just 50db from 80db
[00:07:32] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: Also, you should be aware of issues I'm encountering with running more than a handful of curl processes at once in Emacs.  There seem to be some process-handling-related bugs in Emacs that are causing weird behavior.  I filed a report of some of it at https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=50166, and Lars has been helping, but there's still more work to be done to narrow down what's going on.
[00:07:33] <Bayes> thanks grym
[00:08:09] <bpalmer> makomo: ah. Well, in that case, I'm surprised the overhead of multiple curl processes is really showing up, compared with the overhead of waiting for requests to return.
[00:08:34] <grym> Bayes: more or less, yes.  foam knocks down a broad frequency range
[00:08:39] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: Well, if your requests are necessarily sequential, then I don't know.  I guess what you want is a way to use HTTP keep-alive.  That would probably require some work to use with curl from Emacs.
[00:08:49] <bpalmer> this really is something I would probably do in another language, though, and only provide an interface to with elisp.
[00:08:53] <Bayes> gonna try them out grym
[00:09:04] <Bayes> I so effing hate noise X_X
[00:09:18] <Bayes> I get overwhelmed too easily when it's noisy
[00:09:24] <makomo> bpalmer: me too, but given the overhead i saw when i was spawning 7z a bunch of times (i went from 3.5 s to 0.2 s when i spawned it just once), i'm pretty convinced that might be the issue. haven't yet tested it though :')
[00:09:29] <grym> Bayes: yep, happens.
[00:09:37] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: Curl can take the --url argument over STDIN, so you might be able to configure it to use keep-alive and keep sending the same curl process new URLs over STDIN
[00:09:48] <bpalmer> 7z is probably more cpu bound than io bound, iirc (compression, right?)
[00:10:19] <grym> Bayes: my problem is that i know way too much about how ears work, so noise exposure is half "ow" and half "oh, no, there goes another hair cell..."
[00:10:20] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: mhm, i saw the queueing stuff in elfeed-curl, but as you just wrote, something like keep-alive is what i'm looking for.
[00:10:34] <bpalmer> so it may not be the overhead of actually forking the processes (which on many systems is really cheap nowadays), but the overhead of the actual processes.
[00:10:56] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: I hate to say it, but this might be a case where using a non-Elisp solution would be better, or at least much quicker to develop.  e.g. I'm sure Python's requests lib has good support for that.
[00:11:12] <bpalmer> Regrowing ear functionality vs regrowing teeth functionality -- which will be the biggest improvement in quality of life, and which will get here first?
[00:11:34] <grym> bpalmer: the former, and  i don't know 
[00:11:44] <alphapapa[m]> bpalmer: I'm guessing the overhead comes from establishing connections repeatedly, especially TLS ones

[00:58:36] <makomo> alphapapa[m]: a similar question: any ideas/thoughts on how you're going to handle cookies? only one of the wrappers i've found so far even mentions them (https://github.com/cinsk/emacs-curl, which i found through your notes in plz.el :))
[00:59:46] <alphapapa[m]> makomo: I don't know.  Nothing I'm using it for now, or plan to use it for in the future, requires cookies.  I'd be happy to leave that to user code, which could set and read cookies from the headers without adding special cookie support in plz.el.  But if it's necessary to do that, I'm not necessarily opposed to it.
[00:59:49] <makomo> i'm aware of curl's -b and -c options, but that requires writing/reading from a file when you want to access the values from lisp. i guess a wrapper would either automate that, or perhaps there are some more clever curl flags that would force curl to spit out the values of the cookies

[04:43:45] <bremner> well, you could look at "consfigurator", although it's a pretty young project
[04:45:28] <ProofTechnique> There's also Guix

[04:46:00] <spikemaster> rdrg109: macros open up the possiblity to get a tiny perfomrnace boost here and there while still using an ideal abstraction. like `with-eval-after-load' macro witch you will ikely use heavily in a config file.

Like how ANT was created to configure Java apps, becuase Java was just too painful. Java people were forced to invent a new macro system, creating an entirely new XML based language just to avoid configuting thigns with Java. Even though they were Java programmers.

[07:28:07] <Spawns_Carpeting> there is a google_authenticator pam module that you can setup dieggsy, it required editing some pam rules but it's pretty easy to do

[07:30:59] <dale> OK, I'm going to try this and see if TRAMP does keep some kind of sudo open.
[07:31:08] <Spawns_Carpeting> google_authenticator is a generic OTP pam plugin for linux, it works with any OTP program and has nothing to do with google other than the fact that it was made by them
[07:31:37] <Spawns_Carpeting> the name is misleading 
[07:32:15] <Spawns_Carpeting> its main purpose was for setting up 2fa on ssh connections but you can do lots of neat stuff with it!
[07:32:33] <dale> Yup, sure enough, TRAMP has a sudo process running still.
[07:33:13] <dale> Spawns_Carpeting: Now I wonder why it would ever time out, if it's got the sudo shell.  Is TRAMP killing it?  Is the system, somehow?
[07:34:02] <Spawns_Carpeting> Tramp seems to want to reset it according to some timeout that you can set, for "security reasons"

[07:47:03] <Spawns_Carpeting> yeah I think thats the issue. Emacs regex has * not mean "wildcard"
[07:47:14] <Spawns_Carpeting> at least I think that may be the issue
[07:47:15] <dale> Spawns_Carpeting: I took the "*" off the end because that'll only work if you edit exactly a file named "*", and the timeout is in seconds not minutes.
[07:47:35] <Spawns_Carpeting> whoops, 15s is way too short 
[07:47:39] <dale> In almost all "regexp" engines, you want something like .* to mean the equivalent of * in globs (e.g. shell).
[07:48:28] <Spawns_Carpeting> thats right, my regex is rusty
[07:49:14] <dale> Spawns_Carpeting: But it seems like just matching the prefix of the string is fine, so no .* needed, based on the example.  (I'm having to go by the manual since I don't really use TRAMP much.)
[07:50:02] <dale> I also find it weird that TRAMP wants a string "session-timeout" instead of a symbol like 'session-timeout there, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ TRAMP gonna TRAMP.
[07:51:05] <dale> I wonder when TRAMP was added to Emacs.

[07:55:21] <dale> Spawns_Carpeting: Also, are you actually entering /sudo:root@your_host_name_here:/foo/bar at the find-file prompt?  With your_host_name_here exactly matching the value of system-name?  Or are you just doing /sudo::/foo/bar?  If the latter, you might just need to match /sudo:: for example.
[07:55:44] <dale> I'm not sure if TRAMP does some kind of normalization to turn /sudo::... into /sudo:root@$host:...

[10:47:14] <alphapapa[m]> I've seen people on HN saying they've been committed Apple users and evangelists for years, and now they're dumping all of their Apple gear and have already moved to Linux
[10:47:49] <ext0l> sure, but hacker news is not what i would call a representative sample of the computer-using population
[10:48:15] <alphapapa[m]> That's the funny thing about Apple having embraced Unix, at least for developers: Just as easily as they attracted them to Macs, those same users can migrate away from it when it stops being attractive.
[10:48:33] <ext0l> i see plenty of people in my circles talk about giving up on linux and moving to bsd, but i don't think bsd is about to become the next big thing any time soon :P
[10:48:35] <alphapapa[m]> ext0l: I didn't say "the computer-using population."  I'm talking about developers.
[10:48:52] <ext0l> aha. you just said "users" originally so i wasn't sure

[10:49:27] <alphapapa[m]> Yes, I wonder how many users they will lose over the next year or two.  Some of those developers have been, as I said, evangelists for the platform.  Users end up following developers.
[10:50:25] <alphapapa[m]> One could say that the rose-tinted glasses are falling off.

[10:51:33] <ext0l> no, i do
[10:51:36] <parsnip> i want to join the antagonistic side of this discussion
[10:51:47] <parsnip> full disclosure
[10:51:49] <ext0l> i follow apple somewhat closely for a couple reasons
[10:51:53] <alphapapa[m]> Then, yes, you are being too antagonistic.  :P
[10:52:18] <ext0l> so i'm aware of the growing restrictions and all the signed-binary stuff
[10:52:37] <alphapapa[m]> that's not even what I'm talking about
[10:52:43] <ext0l> what do you mean, then?
[10:52:56] <alphapapa[m]> you really haven't been following the news?
[10:52:57] <parsnip> what is going on exactly? i just hear twb always saying macos will be like ios soon, but i don't know how much he's joking, or how soon this would happen
[10:53:10] <alphapapa[m]> the CSAM scanning spyware stuff
[10:53:16] <ext0l> oh *that*
[10:53:27] <codingquark> parsnip: they seem to be slowly doing it, but don't know how aggressive they eventually want to get
[10:53:33] <ext0l> i knew about that, i just don't see it as a market-share-killer
[10:53:53] <ext0l> if intrusiveness and privacy violation was enough to do that, windows and facebook would be dead
[10:54:00] <alphapapa[m]> people tend to not like their own devices spying on them...funny, that

[10:54:30] <parsnip> my face is being scanned constantly, maybe
[10:54:34] <codingquark> alphapapa[m]: what percentage of people tend not to like that? Around me, 95% of people simply do not care
[10:55:03] <ext0l> people still use windows 10, people still use all these sites that are constantly harvesting user data
[10:55:05] <alphapapa[m]> there's a difference between generic spyware type stuff, which is bad enough, and your own phone in your pocket potentially automatically reporting you to the government and their randomly breaking down your door and throwing you in jail because someone sent a magic number to your phone while you were asleep
[10:55:07] <parsnip> like, people get really adamant about their computer being pure, but not the rest of life

[10:55:47] <parsnip> i have had to use windows at every job
[10:56:27] <ext0l> again, i think you're significantly overestimating how many people are going to care. that's not to say they *shouldn't*, merely a statement of what people at large are like
[10:56:38] <parsnip> and to what degree
[10:56:43] <ryuslash> Yeah, I don't see anyone around me caring about it either. People trust that Apple will not sell them out, and even if it does they "have nothing to hide, so why would it matter?" People might object to it, but then they remember just how convenient they find buying into the Apple platform and stop caring.
[10:56:44] <alphapapa[m]> Why do you think I'm overestimating it when I haven't given an estimate?
[10:57:46] <mattf> org-mode question, how can i filter, copy only, create a new buffer with the undone tasks only (checkboxes that weren't checked)
[10:58:00] <ext0l> because you're coming off to me like you're implying it's going to be a significant amount, and i don't think it will
[10:58:07] <mattf> by undone i mean not done, which means not checked

[11:33:28] <parsnip> bpalmer: the openssl x509 fingerprint command doesn't seem sensitive to trailing newlines
[11:33:48] <parsnip> yes, i read that a few hours ago

[11:35:53] <bpalmer> Yes, it does. It specifically is a fingerprint for the DER encoded version of the certificate
[11:37:36] <bpalmer> the openssl man page is a little ambiguous but the best reading I can give it suggests that sha1 is the default for fingerprint
[11:37:47] <bpalmer> at any rate. 
[11:38:24] <parsnip> i can see openssl x509 fingerprint gives same value for let's encrypt's root ca, but i can't seem to get that value with Dart

[11:40:18] <susam> parsnip: Did you convert the Base64 encoded content to binary format before computing the hash?
[11:40:19] <bpalmer> openssl x509 fingerprint is calculated on the binary (DER) format
[11:41:26] <susam> Yes, You need to extract the Base64 encoded content between the '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----' and '-----END CERTIFICATE-----' lines, then convert it to binary (i.e., base64-decode it), and then compute the hash.
[11:41:53] <bpalmer> parsnip: see https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-io/X509Certificate-class.html and its der property

[11:52:48] <bpalmer> why would dart:io have an X509Certificate and no mention of how to actually create this?

[11:53:31] <bpalmer> why isn't there an overview ?
[11:53:42] <susam> cuz humans ;)
[11:55:45] <bpalmer> ok. So, this is in dart:io potentially because, if you create a SecureSocket, you can access the relevant certificate via its peerCertificate property
[11:56:09] <parsnip> i should grep all those libraries to see if one of them uses base64 like that
[11:56:33] <parsnip> yeah i've only used that thing for when the server.cert is sent and there's an error
[11:56:53] <parsnip> i let the user save the server.cert or trust it or dismiss
[11:57:03] <parsnip> comes up with self-signed ca on ios

[11:57:16] <parsnip> oddly, android, windows, linux, don't care
[11:57:24] <parsnip> same dart library
[11:57:38] <bpalmer> It still doesn't explain why these other random x509 libraries out there don't provide a mechanism to use the dart:io's X509Certificate class, but instead have their own
[11:57:46] <susam> It is worth contributing a cert fingerprint API to Dart if one does not already exist. This is going to trip up many developers. All this Rube Goldberg of format conversions is not obvious at a first glance.

[15:28:17] <susam> Yes, I agree. In fact, the non-alcoholic beers are rarely good substitutes for the original ones in terms of taste.
[15:32:12] <neverwas> Hmm, seems some shops tag Radler as a malt drink. Like a caribbean malt? That stuff's an acquired taste if ever there was one.

[15:59:02] <makomo> hmm, i'm thinking of making use of the advice system in order to customize the behavior of a callback for an async function. any thoughts on whether this is a good idea or if some other mechanism would be better?
[15:59:52] <makomo> i'd like it to be flexible, but i also want to avoid having a bunch of arguments like pre-hook, hook, after-hook, w/e that are supposed to customize the behavior of the callback
[16:01:03] <makomo> the particular use-case is that i have an async function that does some stuff and then starts the same async operation recursively. it keeps doing this until a certain condition is reached
[16:02:24] <makomo> i'd like a nice way of being able to not only customize the callback, but also to decide whether to stop this "async chain", or keep going, etc., which is why :before, :around, :after, :override advice came to my mind

[20:57:50] <bpalmer> (I'm a little bit of a hypocrite: I will use lambdas in hooks for transient things, particularly since most of my hooks are no more than one element long; (setq foo-mode-hook  nil) always gets me out of it)
[20:57:59] <bpalmer> (but anythign that I'm saving in init.el or a library gets a name)
[20:58:37] <bpalmer> This is one of the reasons I defend python's approach to functions/lambdas.
[20:58:46] <vuipuh> Hi! Is there a way to stop emacs from creating temporary files just now while I'm editing a file? Because that file ist just as long as a filename may get, no space left for ~ or #. I am not able to write this file not even into a temporay other name using 'write-file' ! Please help!
[20:59:07] <bremner> uh. what OS has such strict limits?
[20:59:30] <bremner> not that that answers your question, I'm just curious

[21:00:13] <vuipuh> bremner, talking to me? strict? No, just very long filenames. 255 is max on linux fs, right?

[21:00:36] <bremner> vuipuh: I don't think that's a linux limit. But I could be wrong.
[21:00:41] <bpalmer> you can disable auto-save; you can change how it is created  withi auto-save-file-name-transforms, etc
[21:00:41] <bremner> maybe it depends on the fs
[21:01:31] <bpalmer> auto-save-file-name-transforms might be what's involved since by default, if you move it to anothe rdirectory, it will replace / in the full path with !
[21:01:58] <twb> "I'm Batman!  And so is my wife!"
[21:02:18] <oldslippy> might be easier if you just renamed your file, even just while editing it
[21:02:20] <bpalmer> But there's also change backup-enabled-predicate
[21:02:29] <bpalmer> in case the backup file is causing problems.
