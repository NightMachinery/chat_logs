[00:01:37] <da_wunder> I was just commenting to  your "official/real" comment - really that "real" term doesn't differ the "official" so much - so that is why I would use "community support" instead
[00:02:10] <da_wunder> term "real" is quite hard - imho 
[00:02:20] * __adrian shrugs
[00:02:21] <__adrian> ok
[00:03:10] <da_wunder> for me that sounds more like politics - party A is "real" when party B is not and so on
[00:03:13] <TinoDidriksen> While https://www.php.net/support.php#irc says there is no official channel, it mentions Libera first. Other networks are in ().
[00:03:55] <da_wunder> so you're saying that first is the "real" and other ones aren't ?
[00:04:00] <__adrian> it's not meant as politics. refer to context: people were asking which libera channel corresponded to the freenode channel.
[00:04:46] <__adrian> i was answering that question. note the channel is not actually labeled as "real" nor "official" anywhere.
[00:05:09] <da_wunder> and still you was using both of those terms
[00:06:25] <__adrian> i feel like you understand what i'm saying. if not, ...sorry? i don't have another way to explain/clarify.
[00:11:14] <da_wunder> my point here is not to call this channel (or any other) to "official" or "real" support channel - if there is clear saying that in php.net site - and that is why I would call this channel (and others too) community support 
[00:11:38] <__adrian> again, consider context.
[00:11:55] <__adrian> and calling the channel "community support" is certainly fine/accurate
[00:12:18] <TinoDidriksen> This is the official PHP channel on Libera, is an accurate statement.
[00:13:15] <__adrian> ^ as in, we own the #php namespace, yes.

[00:15:27] <da_wunder> imho - it would be official IF php.net website itself tells that - without that anyone could create a channel to another network and be eg. racist there and so on..
[00:15:56] <TinoDidriksen> The "on Libera" is part of that statement.
[00:16:20] <biberu> __adrian: did you claim ##php too?
[00:17:22] <__adrian> biberu: yes but it hasn't gone through yet for some reason. no worries. we can just sit there a while longer and say "go to #"
[00:18:28] <biberu> ah, i'll keep doing that then ^^

[00:53:24] <robertparkerx> I may be in the wrong channel so tell me if I am. I have a PHP script that creates a VCS it seems but I'm not sure if this is compatible with all calendars because I thought I read yesterday that ICS was the option. Now it seems it just creates the file format and print the information on new lines with what looks like labels. Can I do the same for ICS?
[00:56:22] <entuland> doesn't look like a PHP-specific query, you should probably check the differences between those two file formats
[00:56:49] <robertparkerx> yea that is what I was wondering too
[00:56:50] <entuland> found some hits about that, such as using outlook to convert ICS to VCS
[00:56:52] <__adrian> i couldn't answer what's copatible with vcs. ics is the more recent format, but even that is old 
[00:57:18] <__adrian> regarding your script, where'd you get it?
[00:57:27] <__adrian> probably best to ask there.
[00:57:30] <robertparkerx> my PM
[00:57:43] <TinoDidriksen> ICS is the format for calendar stuff. I've never even heard of VCS as a calendar format.
[00:58:37] <__adrian> vcs is the ics predecessor, mostly use in outlook before anyone cared about sharing calendars on the internet
[01:00:53] <robertparkerx> I think I can do ICS instead
[01:01:01] <robertparkerx> I just need to know how to create these strings
[01:01:12] <robertparkerx> like the timezone and datetime
[01:01:24] <robertparkerx> this time stamp
[01:01:38] <daoumilseitek> robertparkerx: sabre lib ?
[01:01:49] <__adrian> https://icalendar.org/
[01:01:54] <daoumilseitek> i hear it's good
[01:01:56] <robertparkerx> JThat's what I got it from
[01:02:02] <robertparkerx> __adrian
[01:02:24] <TinoDidriksen> Oh, VCS is vCalendar. That I've heard of. But iCalendar is basically vCal, plus more. If you could output vCal, you can easily change to iCal.
[01:02:42] <robertparkerx> What is '20210613T202921Z'
[01:02:57] <robertparkerx> it looks like a datetime
[01:03:02] <daoumilseitek> it is 
[01:03:13] <TinoDidriksen> That's the same date format as in VCS.
[01:03:26] <robertparkerx> NICE

[04:36:23] <__adrian> if you want your particular format, then regex is not the answer: parse the template

[04:58:39] <Blondie101010> yep, that's why I only showed the specific regex to get the tag parts
[04:59:19] <Blondie101010> trim() with explode() is a good alternative
[05:07:58] <jargon> https://pastebin.com/8YqhF2bz :/
[05:13:23] <Blondie101010> as I explained yesterday, use traces like: echo "params: "; var_export($params);
[05:14:55] <Blondie101010> actually a more useful example would be: echo "matches: "; var_export($matches);
[05:18:44] <__adrian> ...where did you get the idea for that for() loop? what do you intend to accomplish with it?
[05:19:05] <Blondie101010> $in is the whole template
[05:20:23] <jargon> To loop until no more matches have been made.
[05:21:04] <Blondie101010> do you really need that?
[05:21:13] <Blondie101010> recursive parsing is risky
[05:21:45] <jargon> Then how is it supposed to be done?
[05:21:46] <__adrian> it's iterative... but in a really unintuitive way
[05:22:00] <jargon> It iterates the same way one would iterate files.
[05:22:00] <__adrian> like i said, i'd parse it
[05:22:12] <__adrian> but if you want regex, then likely you'd use preg_replace_callback()
[05:22:19] <__adrian> (with no loop)
[05:22:40] <__adrian> jargon: that's not how anyone would iterate files either  ;)
[05:23:15] <jargon> Whta is a callback>
[05:23:17] <jargon> Whta is a callback?
[05:23:27] <jargon> What*
[05:23:35] <__adrian> it's a function that is invoked as a step in another process
[05:23:46] <__adrian> in this case, to determine what replacement to make on a match
[05:24:54] <__adrian> e.g.,  function my_process(callable $your_callback) { somthing_i_want_to_do(); $your_callback(); }
[05:25:46] <jargon> I have no idea what that means.
[05:28:52] <Blondie101010> jargon:  the call back in there would be something to call to process each match
[05:31:38] <jargon> is callback a string or a literal expression?
[05:31:42] <Blondie101010> preg_replace_callback($pattern, function ($match) { return processMatchReplace($match); }, $in);
[05:31:49] <__adrian> "@__adrian> it's a function"
[05:32:26] <__adrian> any callable, but think "function"
[05:32:46] <__adrian> https://php.net/callable
[05:39:05] <__adrian> e.g., https://3v4l.org/tutn9
[05:39:38] <__adrian> note there's zero validation here - you'd want to do that (verify the template values make sense)
[05:43:08] <Blondie101010> @__adrian:  you found a way to write code that's only valid on 8.0.0

[19:42:34] <DevAntoine> So, as always I got a naming issue... I've got a method which takes a firm's identifier and configure it's contract option to "quotation" (and set it's quotation's status to "candidate").
[19:42:59] <DevAntoine> We've got a "FirmManager" where it could fit, because eh, anything related to Firm fits in this stuff.
[19:43:51] <DevAntoine> But I'm wondering if creating another class wouldn't be better and if so in which namespace (obviously not "App\Manager" nor "App\Entity" but you get what I mean).

[20:05:41] <onizu> hi, is there a way to have array_keys() return the keys as strings and not ints ?
[20:05:57] <__adrian> int array keys are always ints
[20:06:09] <__adrian> you'd have to cast to string, if that was important (for some reason)
[20:06:24] <da_wunde1> array_map(fn ($x) => (string)$x, array_keys($array));
[20:06:28] <onizu> int array keys meaning?
[20:07:12] <da_wunde1> onizu: create example of your issue to https://3v4l.org/ - so that we can see what you're trying to do
[20:07:13] <__adrian> if a value you use for an array key can be losslessly represented as an int (e.g., 1, 1.0, "1") then it will be an int. you cannot change that.
[20:07:30] <onizu> well, I have a set of keys stored in an array (as strings) and I have to get a union of this and the result of array_keys() 
[20:08:01] <onizu> __adrian: ok

[20:09:40] <olle> DevAntoine: $foo->setQuotationStatus($id, $status)?
[20:09:46] <__adrian> an empty string implies there was no error
[20:10:08] <__adrian> https://php.net/shell_exec  ← see "Return Values"
[20:10:26] <LuksNuke> yes i mean null
[20:10:32] <__adrian> see also the first "Note"
[20:10:33] <LuksNuke> but i don't know where it hangs
[20:10:48] <LuksNuke> i'm using a linux os
[20:11:05] <__adrian> i would have assumed so  :)  but that's not relevant
[20:11:20] <__adrian> read the first "Note"
[20:11:53] <__adrian> i.e., if the command is returning an exit code, use exec() instead an you'll be able to check that
[20:11:55] <onizu> https://3v4l.org/vPDsg --- want to have a union of $set1 and $arr2
[20:12:04] <LuksNuke> oh i just could try exec()
[20:12:11] <LuksNuke> will do so tomorrow at work
[20:12:18] <__adrian> onizu: is there a reason you're storing the other keys as strings?
[20:12:31] <onizu> no
[20:12:42] <__adrian> a union of [1] and ["1"] is, correctly, [1,"1"]
[20:12:53] <__adrian> store them as ints then
[20:12:54] <onizu> i just stored the $key of foreach($something as $key => $val) in an array
[20:13:00] <onizu> ok
[20:13:18] <onizu> just wondered if there was an option for array_keys() to return the keys in a desired type 
[20:13:21] <onizu> k, thanks
[20:13:35] <__adrian> "i just stored the $key "  // the $key would be an int (i.e., 1), not a string ("1")
[20:13:53] <__adrian> i'm talking about $arr2 in your example. yes?
[20:13:54] <onizu> oh sorry
[20:14:16] <onizu> it was not the key of $key => $val.. i had stored some other value, 
[20:14:19] <onizu> mistake
