[04:56:55] <Nanobot> "Perhaps I'm not prioritizing my duty to the kingdom. Perhaps I'm forcing my own interests onto my boyfriend. Or, perhaps dressing my boyfriend in cute women's underwear is the true path to justice. Who is to say? All I can do is follow what my heart tells me is right, and every fiber of my being tells me that this will look perfect on him."
[04:57:03] <MootPoot> what
[04:57:04] <MootPoot> lol
[04:58:43] <Nanobot> It's a story about a girl stealing women's underwear to force her boyfriend to wear, which kicks off a chain of events that eventually gets them both the death penalty.
[04:59:08] <MootPoot> sounds about right
[04:59:30] <MootPoot> if people die in a fantasy world do they get isekai-ed to modern japan?
[05:03:05] <Nanobot> If you find an angel and touch her gold halo, the halo will turn white and she becomes bound to you. Then, if something happens that would kill you, the halo activates. Your body becomes ephemeral, and you go into a trance. The halo turns red, drops down around the angel's neck, and tightens down upon it. It lifts the angel into the air, shrinks her down, and pulls her into your mouth. You will absentmindedly chew her, barely aware enough to experience 
[05:03:05] <Nanobot> the sensations in your mouth. When you swallow, your health becomes restored and you become corporal and conscious again. It's essentially the same as a bottled fairy in Zelda.

[05:18:50] <isekaijin> So, I just learnt that I need to connect my graphics tablet directly to the graphics card... Do graphics cards normally come with a USB port?
[05:19:02] <MootPoot> some of them do
[05:19:14] <MootPoot> its relatively rare though - only on the very high end cards
[05:19:22] <MootPoot> usually for VR purposes
[05:19:38] <MootPoot> isekaijin: how goes your quest in windows-land
[05:20:08] <MootPoot> but its rare enough that unless you explicitly got a card with one - you most likely do not have one
[05:20:21] <MootPoot> although that usb port is usually just like any other usb port - nothing special 
[05:21:33] <isekaijin> The manufacturer of my graphics tablet says ‚Äúif you have a dedicated graphics card, then you need to connect the tablet to it, rather than to the motherboard‚Äù. So now I need to open the PC case just to see which USB ports, if any, are connected to the graphics card rather than to the motherboard.

[11:54:25] <Bco1981> yeah
[11:54:33] <MootPoot> hopefully they'll release it
[11:54:39] <MootPoot> and we can have open source drivers
[11:54:43] <MootPoot> not shit drivers for linux
[11:54:51] <MootPoot> I wonder if its illegal to use it like that
[11:55:04] <MootPoot> I mean, you didn't hack/steal it so
[11:55:32] <MootPoot> also, one other thing I dont get
[11:55:47] <Bco1981> that nouveau driver is really bad, it works. barely. but it was a world of difference in performance to install the real nvidia driver on this old timer.
[11:55:49] <MootPoot> they say stuff like "companies hacked, released X database / data"
[11:56:01] <MootPoot> but where is this data
[11:56:05] <MootPoot> can I download it
[11:56:08] <MootPoot> :3
[11:57:34] <Bco1981> those hackers picked a new target.

[14:14:14] <MootPoot> ew
[14:14:14] <Bco1981> can't see why he can't just virtualbox a windows for that.
[14:14:21] <MootPoot> disgusting
[14:14:25] <MootPoot> mobile games
[14:14:32] <Bco1981> my kids use it, works very nicely for android gaming on windows.
[14:14:37] <MootPoot> I can get pngs for free on rule34...
[14:15:59] <MootPoot> I need more coffee
[14:16:21] <MootPoot> amigojapan: sometimes I feel like I dont know anything about computers
[14:16:23] <MootPoot> ugh
[14:16:45] <MootPoot> I have now been unemployed for over a month
[14:16:54] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you should study ben eaters computers and get the very basics down
[14:17:06] <MootPoot> I've watched his videos
[14:17:11] <MootPoot> I wanted to buy that 300 dollar kit
[14:17:20] <MootPoot> but dont have the money atm
[14:17:37] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I made the timer in his computer using a simulator
[14:18:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: taht simulator supported all the parts of the timer
[14:18:18] <MootPoot> the problem is I want to know that stuff
[14:18:22] <MootPoot> but that stuff wont get me a job
[14:18:31] <MootPoot> at least not in what I want to do atm
[14:19:54] <Matt|home> ... alright. now im annoyed
[14:20:01] <Matt|home> has anyone here read the comics alex+ada ?
[14:20:15] <MootPoot> no
[14:20:31] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there are two approaches to earning computers, bottom up, like with ben eater computers, or top down, like you did with C#
[14:21:17] <MootPoot> technically  my first language was java
[14:21:25] <MootPoot> although I dropped it after like 1 week
[14:21:26] <MootPoot> lol
[14:21:28] <amigojapan> eww
[14:21:51] <MootPoot> amigojapan: my dad gave me ( I was 6 at the time ) a 1200 page long O'riely java book
[14:21:55] <MootPoot> then he told me
[14:22:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: altho Java has many jobs, if you are willing to go thru hell

[14:23:13] <MootPoot> but every time I got stuck it was impossible, no help IRL, and idk where to get help
[14:23:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you should have used scratch at 6
[14:26:00] <MootPoot> now my problems atm are basically

[21:09:30] <Satin> ya windows has different profiles for different form factors
[21:09:57] <isekaijin> Well, just because I'm using a tablet, it doesn't mean I don't want to resize windows.
[21:10:21] <isekaijin> For me, a tablet and a pen is simply a monitor and a mouse that happen to be easier to draw with.
[21:10:47] <Satin> can you point at the corners and resize?
[21:11:19] <isekaijin> I can, as long as I can guess if the cursor is focused on a corner.
[21:11:37] <isekaijin> But there's no cursor on the screen, so I can't see directly where I'm clicking.

[21:14:36] <Jigsy> I'd just like to interject for a second. What you're referring to as Windows is in fact Microsoft/Windows, or as I've taken to calling it Microsoft plus Windows.
[21:15:00] <isekaijin> Actually, that is probably an accurate description of Windows 10.
