[15:05:29] <kilobug> bung6[m]: he's not a "pedophile" in the sense that he ever had any sexual relation with a child (or even any special attraction towards them), but in the sense that his defense of "freedom" and "pro-choice" extends to considering that teenagers (and maybe even children ?) should be allowed to participate in sexual activities if they so desire; but that's just his personal opinion is not related to the FSF

[16:30:14] <random-nick> yes, I know that, I am just curious about the difference between a ultra-permissive license like bsd 0-clause and a public domain dedication like unlicense
[16:32:18] <isf> the important is the difference between copyleft or non copyleft license
[16:32:46] <isf> public domain dont have copyleft
[16:33:49] <isf> what type of software you are licensing random-nick?
[16:34:46] <random-nick> I'm not asking about my own software but about other people's software
[16:35:53] <random-nick> for example youtube-dl is dedicated to the public domain and in the common lisp community there are several notable softwares licensed under the unlicense or dedicated to the public domain

[16:38:43] <isf> Public domain software is software that is not copyrighted. If the source code is in the public domain, that is a special case of noncopylefted free software, which means that some copies or modified versions may not be free at all.
[16:38:54] <isf> In some cases, an executable program can be in the public domain but the source code is not available. This is not free software, because free software requires accessibility of source code. Meanwhile, most free software is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted, and the copyright holders have legally given permission for everyone to use it in freedom, using a free software license.
[16:39:25] <isf> Sometimes people use the term âpublic domainâ in a loose fashion to mean âfreeâ or âavailable gratis.â However, âpublic domainâ is a legal term and means, precisely, ânot copyrighted.â For clarity, we recommend using âpublic domainâ for that meaning only, and using other terms to convey the other meanings.
[16:40:08] <isf> random-nick https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html i recommend you visit the articles :)
[16:41:18] <vivien> Public domain is mostly US-specific though, usually public domain software also include a lax license that works around the world
[16:45:21] <vivien> For instance, the unlicense comes with a paragraph that acts as a license: Anyone is free to â¦ by any means.
[16:46:41] <vivien> However Iâm not sure you can accept external contributions

[20:45:43] <craigt> hwpplayer1: We can review it for entry in the FSD.

[20:51:29] <hwpplayer1> https://github.com/247supportorg/log4j-scan/blob/master/Dockerfile
[20:52:12] <tfisgnag> craigt:Â  I only changed what was in the "License verified date:" and the "License verified by:" fields last week. So I am not sure what should be changed in the "License copyright " field now.
[20:52:56] <hwpplayer1> tfisgnag which entry ?
[20:53:28] <craigt> tfisgnag: In "License copyright" it currently says, "Copyright (C) 2012-2015 Mailvelope GmbH" We should update that if we can.
[20:55:44] <hwpplayer1> craigt it says python as a dependency
[20:56:23] <craigt> hwpplayer1: Is python in the FSD?

[20:58:53] <craigt> hwpplayer1: Agreed on adding python in the dependency section.
[20:59:56] <craigt> tfisgnag: A copyright notice should include any year changes were made to the material. I'm confident Mailvelope has had updates since 2015. We should find a more current year.
[21:00:50] <tfisgnag> Which is the best place to start that sort of search?

[21:31:37] <tfisgnag> craigt: Last week things seemed simpler.
[21:31:43] <tfisgnag> I remained with the idea that after updating the "License verified date:" and the "License verified by:" fields I only had to update the "download link" and that after that I could "save"
[21:32:32] <tfisgnag> But now new things have arisen and I would like to know why?

[21:36:55] <craigt> tfisgnag: Or if there are any additional details we could add to improve the entry.
[21:39:08] <tfisgnag> I understand. You have a lot of things to do here and teaching illiterates like me mustn't be an easy task. Perhaps it's my mistake. Perhaps there are other things I should learn to do before trying to learn how toÂ  update a FSD entry. If that is so,Â  I would be very grateful if you could call my attention on that.

[23:05:47] <kompowiec> The last time I had a Christmas tree a few years ago, which was 50 cm and in addition it burned down because the manufacturer saved money on insulation (and in fact, it was not there). since then, it has not been celebrating at all.
[23:09:26] <Noisytoot> How did you manage to burn down a Christmas tree?
[23:10:47] <kompowiec> the tree contained Christmas lights that were attached to it permanently. Anyway IMO planned obsolescence it's probably best way to promote free software
[23:10:53] <craigt> Noisytoot: Anything is possible with the power of Christmas.
[23:11:15] <kompowiec> hehe
[23:15:25] <kompowiec> meh once seen a huge page about reasons about using open source depending on the economic sector but I can't found

[23:31:37] <craigt> That's a wrap for this week'

[23:33:29] <craigt> tpefreedom: I can't find the freedom ladder schedule. I would suggest asking campaigns@fsf.org.

[23:33:51] <AIM[m]> Hey, I'm new here. What's the meeting?
[23:33:59] <AIM[m]> Is it like a webinar?
[23:34:22] <Noisytoot> It's on IRC and it just finished
[23:34:23] <craigt> AIM[m]: Every week we meet for three hours to work on the Free Software Directory. https://directory.fsf.org
[23:35:01] <tfisgnag> craigt: I try to take notes. But my notes are a mess. Do you need a proof?Â  It took me more than 20 minutes to find the folder we were working on.
[23:35:18] <craigt> AIM[m]: The meetings are mostly self directed with volunteers following the participation guide. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[23:35:20] <AIM[m]> Oh, Great! Wonderful!

[23:35:46] <AIM[m]> Is it an irc meet?
[23:35:50] <craigt> tfisgnag: No need for proof. I just imagine the notes would be useful to someone else that is new to the Directory.
[23:36:03] <craigt> AIM[m]: Yes, IRC.
[23:36:13] <Noisytoot> craigt, When will the FSF set up fsfbot?
[23:36:18] <AIM[m]> Oh okay!
[23:38:20] <craigt> Noisytoot: Good question, but I don't have an answer. I appreciate the work you've done, but I don't know what is needed from the FSF (that is, I don't have that particular skill).
[23:38:21] <tfisgnag> craigt: IÂ  hope that some day I will have enough time to order them and share them with you. I would like if they could help you in your teaching job.

[23:42:24] <tfisgnag> craigt: you will have to keep in mind that they will only be useful for people who know almost nothing about computing like me and I have the feeling that I am a black sheep in this flock:]
[23:43:18] <tfisgnag> See you next week. Have a great weeik
[23:43:29] <craigt> tfisgnag: See you next week. Take care.
