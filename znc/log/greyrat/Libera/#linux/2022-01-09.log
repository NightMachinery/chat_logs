[00:00:35] <Platonides> the FS needs to support that
[00:00:38] <ayecee> the filesystem structures are often sized according to the size of the disk
[00:00:41] <Platonides> it's not trivial
[00:00:47] <Blondie101010> OpenBDSM:  well think it out
[00:01:05] <Blondie101010> it is much easier to expand anything than to shrink it

[00:01:30] <ayecee> apparerently not!
[00:01:34] <rbox> haha!
[00:01:34] <lacroix> shrinking a fs is a massive change in the existing layout
[00:01:49] <Platonides> OpenBDSM: you mean when the filesystem isn't using the whole partition?
[00:01:57] <Platonides> that's quite different than a filesystem with free space
[00:01:58] <lacroix> doing this online is hard because you have to be able to recover from sudden powerlos/crash

[00:07:26] <tirnanog> yes, your future. not the future of the technological landscape, to be clear.
[00:07:28] <matsaman> but since you have redundant systems, it doesn't matter if you shrink it offline, RITE?
[00:07:35] <tirnanog> lvm thin provisioning has been around for a while and works.
[00:07:36] <OpenBDSM> Blondie101010, but mooom!
[00:07:41] <OpenBDSM> it's 2022!
[00:07:50] <matsaman> and redundancy's been around even longer, and works better
[00:07:51] <Blondie101010> because the FS devs decided not to write code that would knowingly break systems
[00:08:37] <Blondie101010> and the need to shrink a FS is ALWAYS a planning mistake

[00:09:59] <akonai> software did evolve, it's called btrfs
[00:10:25] <Blondie101010> OpenBDSM:  the day you come up with a FS of your own, I will test it out, and if it is good, I'll even say so, but until then, can you stop complaining about people who actually do things for you

[00:10:29] <rbox> i acn't belive its not butter, fs!
[00:10:32] <OpenBDSM> matsaman, I am biting elbows for not choosing LVM. I blame ubuntu.
[00:10:46] <matsaman> you shouldn't
[00:10:50] <matsaman> people are ignorant, and then they aren't
[00:10:54] <matsaman> usually because they learn the hard way
[00:10:56] <matsaman> the hard way is normal
[00:11:06] <rbox> lvm won't magically let you shrink ext4... nor is it a reaplcement for ext4...
[00:11:21] <matsaman> even with one system, you could provision an entire redundant system to swap into place so you can take the first one offline
[00:11:24] <matsaman> all after the fact
[00:11:34] <OpenBDSM> but LVM is less scary stuff to work with
[00:11:53] <tirnanog> no. but thin provisioning does entail that space within the storage pool is only used upon it being allocated by the filesystem, no matter how large the filesystem is.

[00:53:31] <Blondie101010> the classic 2*RAM was never really good
[00:53:45] <Blondie101010> but it satisfies hybernation
[00:53:52] <deniska> it was kinda good when average RAM was much smaller than an average disk
[00:54:04] * Blondie101010 nods
[00:54:06] <hexnewbie> 1*RAM should also satisfy hibernation, though, unless you really overuse the swap
[00:54:08] <r3tt21> so with no need of hibernatiotn, how much swap should I create for 32GB machine?
[00:54:09] <Mardek> I think 2*RAM is a good rule up to 8gb of RAM
[00:54:11] <Blondie101010> no

[00:55:39] <Blondie101010> it's not a directory

[01:07:04] <hexnewbie> For practical purposes, evicting cache and swapping out differ only by the fact that letter is more expensive due to having to *write* it, where as the cache is already on disk. Otherwise, programs can freely use files as if they were RAM, and RAM as if it were files.

[01:37:53] <tirnanog> linearbit: it's wrong though. it can raise errors as a result of not using depth-first recursion in all but the most trivial cases. you want to operate on the deepest directories first, basically.
[01:38:30] <tirnanog> also, you're not using -empty there which will result in spew for populated directories.

[02:20:50] <Sabinno> Hello folks. Spoke with a kaizushi earlier about why I can't log in to my Cent box after restoring from an rsnapshot backup with rsync. Said something about restoring pam file caps. Can anyone elaborate on that? Google is awfully vague and provides basically no results.
[02:21:18] <ayecee> he gave a command to use, did you record that

[02:24:03] <Dagmar> restorecon resets SELInux contexts to what they should be and generally is completely safe to run

[02:25:37] <Sabinno> Can't hurt.
[02:26:04] <Dagmar> Unless youv'e been manually tweaking contexts like a savage instead of using semanage, it's totally safe
[02:26:07] <ayecee> wouldn't hurt to examine the logs to see if this is actually the problem or if there's a different one.
[02:26:29] <Dagmar> I wasnt aware any pam files had special capabilities applied that could break things tho
[02:26:31] <Sabinno> What's the best command to view audit logs?

[02:26:45] <Dagmar> The audit.log is text
[02:26:55] <Dagmar> ...and if you restored the filesstem with rsync you WILL need to reset all the contexts.
[02:26:57] <ayecee> how did we get on audit logs
[02:26:58] <Sabinno> Yeah, cat is unreadable though bc it's so long lol
[02:27:01] <Dagmar> Rsync can't reliably back up those things

[03:35:21] <pnbeast> Jong, that's not going to be good for teaching you day-to-day usage, though.  There, I'd try things like one of the two sys-admin books and user guides.

[19:02:48] <r3tt> I find trouble understanding debian distros. WHat exactly is contrib/non-free ?
[19:03:07] <labrador> non-free is proprietary software
[19:03:09] <knotMez> just stuff FLOSS zealots can't quite square with
[19:03:31] <labrador> contrib is software that is free but depends on non-free
[19:03:34] <labrador> knotMez, no
[19:03:37] <knotMez> usually non-GLP licensed
[19:03:39] <labrador> Its very important
[19:03:44] <labrador> knotMez, again no
[19:03:46] <knotMez> GPL even
[19:03:53] <labrador> Its a non free license
[19:03:54] <r3tt> OK, so why is there a reason of providing non-free (unofficial) debian installers?
[19:04:05] <labrador> r3tt, so people can do it easier
[19:04:06] <r3tt> if this non-free/contrib can be added to source.list later on

[19:04:33] <knotMez> 10:34 Ignoring ALL from labrador
[19:04:46] <r3tt> So there's absolutely no difference, if I download official debian .iso, install it, editd source.list by adding "contrib non-free" to every line
[19:04:54] <labrador> ok,I could care less
[19:04:58] <r3tt> vs installing non-free unofficial .iso, right?

[19:06:23] <labrador> well you'll probably need nonfree firmware for a lot more
[19:06:25] <r3tt> then i guess installing official .iso and adding non-free to source.list later will be much better?
[19:06:27] <labrador> like cpu microcode

[22:23:23] <gregu-> Hello, i am trying to understand how iptables work, and for now i am bit confused with the syntax. Could someone explain me , or point to the right direction ?  If i have a command: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT  , It states :   " If i will receive traffic on port 80 of TCP protocol , i should allow it"  .My question is :
[22:23:23] <gregu-> If i have 3 interface : wan0, lan0, lan1  . IT would accept traffic tcp/80 on all the devices, from any source ip that could be, and that would be for ipv4 only ?  So anyne from the internet could access  my 3 ips wanip, lan0ip, lan1ip on port 80/tcp ?    IF that's the case, then  i think it would be recommended to  write it using the -i
[22:23:24] <gregu-> param ? as in : sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT -i wan0   , and that would mean that the traffic would be accepted on the interface wan0, but not on lan0,lan0  ?
[22:23:53] <lacroix> Schrostfutz, if that doesn't suit you, you can use fsnotify. inotifywatch/wait are userspace tools that use it - /SET beep_msg_level MSGS HILIGHT DCCMSGS
[22:24:25] <blackgatonegro> So besides the fact people had to take the effort to install your program you made a huge installer with a ton of crap in an era when download speeds and space in the hard disk was laughable?
[22:24:34] <lacroix> gregu-, please do not copy/paste your question that way, It will flood the channel. Write it consistanty or use a pastebin
[22:24:52] <hexnewbie> blackgatonegro: Netscape 4.x for Linux ought to have bundled X11AMP, IglooFTP, RAR, and xv

[22:25:45] <gregu-> let me put it better. Anyone that has access to those ipnterfaces ip ,  would be able to access port 80/tcp  since the command did not specify -i wan0 ?

The packet gets accepted by lan0 interface, system checked if i have any blocking rule on lan0? If not, it gets somehow passed to wan0 , and then system checks if the source of this packet is 10.0.0.0/24 ?
[22:39:30] <ayecee> don't think it'll work that way, but that's the idea.
[22:39:44] <gregu-> How will the system move this packet from lan0 to wan0 , and there any mechanisms that add more rules when packet is handed from lan0 to wan0 ? So i should allow traffic 2.2.2.2:80 on the lan0 (no source ip, as this interface has only 10.0.0.0/24 connected - it would be that system is allowed to forward anything to wan0), or on wan0 (with source ip

[22:42:54] <Blondie101010> and do the DNAT to get packets to your webserver on the LAN

[22:53:12] <hexnewbie> gregu-: Forwarding simply occurs when a machine receives a packet for which it is NOT the destination, and has been configured to allow such forwarding. It receives it the same way it receives packets for local processes, then sends it the same way it the same way it sends those originating from local processes. Except the filtering for it occurs in a different, third, chain, special for that purpose.
[22:53:32] *** Joins: contra (~ultra@134.17.158.150)
[22:53:37] <Blondie101010> gregu-:  the PREROUTING DNAT rule will change the destination address to be on your LAN, which is why the packet needs to be forwarded/routed

[22:56:37] <ayecee> gregu-: lan computer checks its routing table, sees the most specific route points to the router, as a gateway.
[22:56:42] <gregu-> computer 10.0.0.10 sends packet to its GW which is 10.0.0.1 , then gw inspects the pact, and sees, well, this is not destined to me.
[22:56:48] <Blondie101010> so you're not looking at an incoming web request?

[22:57:05] <Blondie101010> ok lets follow this one
[22:57:15] <gregu-> or is this straight going to forward thingy and gets inspected there ?
[22:57:38] <Blondie101010> gregu-:  yes, your client machine will send its non local traffic to its default gateway

[23:05:20] <Blondie101010> this needs to be fixed NOW
[23:05:24] <gregu-> server looks at the packet that arrived on lan0, and states: well this is definitely not a packet to man lan0,  so , the only way for me to move it , is to send it via wan0 as this is my last resort GW

[23:06:15] <ayecee> gregu-: the FORWARD filter chain would be used for this one
[23:06:52] <ayecee> the forward rules could examine the source and destination address, and also the source and destination interface.

[23:07:15] <lacroix> ayecee, keep it decent. last time.
[23:07:18] <ayecee> gregu-: correct, a packet destined for a non-local address is forwarded, and uses the FORWARD chain

[23:16:18] <ayecee> gry: both of us were anticipating a question from gregu-, and misinterpreted yours as coming from gregu-.
[23:16:36] <gry> ah
[23:18:22] <gregu-> so what all that being said , how would a rule look like that is actually allowing the network  residing behind lan0 , to talk to 10.0.1.10:80/tcp .  I found on google some syntax,  i will do my best to make it sound correct:  iptables -A FORWARD -i lan0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   , now this command its not looking ok. IT does not specify
[23:18:22] <gregu-> for example, where is this traffic directed , or from whom ? It just stand interface lan0. Are there paramterers that allow me to be recised as in : from whom is the traffic being forwarded, to whom ?  like :  -a forward -i lan0 -p tcp --dport 80 --sport ANY (i guess it shold be any , i assumed there is sport like source port) , and --sourceip
[23:18:23] <gregu-> 10.0.0.0/24 -- destinationIP 10.0.1.10/32   ?
[23:18:46] <hexnewbie> The two-body is a simple question on two lines, whose answer is several weeks of work writing it down 😛
[23:18:49] <gregu-> and better yet, would that be really enough for this to work  ? what about traffic coming back ?

[23:20:22] <gregu-> i would neet to write another rule ? this time -a forward -i lan0 -p tcp --sport 80 --dport ANY , --sourceip 10.0.1.10/32 -destinationIP 10.0.0.0/24
[23:20:23] <celphi> ive use pcsc_scan and it detects usb and smartcard

[23:57:34] <celphi> 141
[23:57:39] <hexnewbie> celphi: Is your user 'anonymous'?
[23:57:42] <celphi> yes
[23:57:58] <hexnewbie> celphi: And ‘grep 141 /etc/group’ only gives you this line, and no others?

[23:58:28] <packet_lozenge> BSaboia: probably a silly question, but are you running as root?

[23:59:29] <hexnewbie> velix: Well, I'd go for good = secure in this case, too
[23:59:49] <ayecee> there's some important part of this scenario that's missing and it's hard to tell what it is.
