[19:14:24] <xnaas> hmm
[19:14:45] <xnaas> Chromium is the only 1 of the Big Three (Firefox, Safari, and Chromium) that doesn't play video/quicktime
[19:14:50] <xnaas> you have to set it to video/mp4
[19:30:56] <MiniDigger> isn't quicktime dead?
[19:35:17] <xnaas> not really
[19:36:30] <xnaas> If you upload recording from, say, your iDevice, it'll be a .mov with:
[19:36:30] <xnaas> Format                                   : MPEG-4
[19:36:30] <xnaas> Format profile                           : QuickTime
[19:38:09] <xnaas> I also see people link .mov files from Discord a lot
[19:38:15] <xnaas> and Discord serves them as video/quicktime
[19:38:41] <xnaas> But Discord also embeds their own .mov files and is Chromium based (Electron), so...they must package something.
[19:38:57] <xnaas> Since I couldn't get a video/quicktime to play in any Chromium browser ðŸ˜…
[20:23:25] <MiniDigger> ah, the quicktime framework is ded
[20:25:12] <xnaas> I think https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1120292#c6 explains the issue
[20:25:19] <xnaas> > We don't accept video/quicktime as a synonym for video/mp4, but if Firefox and Safari do, we probably should too.
[20:25:45] <xnaas> I'm not about to dig through webkit or firefox source code to verify if that's how they handle it...but seems likely
