[03:55:18] <oerheks> Press Alt + F7 to move a window or Alt + F8 to resize.
[03:55:48] <samian> alt + f8 is just vertical resize?
[03:55:52] <samian> what about horizontal?
[03:55:53] <sarnold> samian: try alt+shift+drag, alt+ctrl+drag, windows+shift+drag, windows+ctrl+drag, etx
[03:56:07] <oerheks> depends where your mouse is hanging, i guess
[03:57:00] <samian> ahh it does both vertical and horizontal. It was just that my hexchat window was on the minimum width so it appeared as if the width wasn't doing anything

[04:02:14] <samian> MrSteve,  on large monitors with 4k res, it's a pain to get the mouse array right on the corner
[04:02:27] <MrSteve> i use the gnome.

[07:16:17] <Linkandzelda> can I use the ubuntu server ISO to install a bootable system to a usb stick plugged in the same system?
[07:17:29] <mybalzitch> tomreyn: I'm on IRC. I'm not signing up for some discus account to report the issue when the maintainers for said documentation likely idle here, or someone else has an account.
[07:17:49] <tomreyn> Linkandzelda: yes
[07:19:03] <Linkandzelda> tomreyn: great, thanks. gonna put my OS on a usb plugged to my server's motherboard and free up a sata port
[07:20:06] <tomreyn> mybalzitch: it uses ubuntu sso, so if you already have an account there then you wont need to create another.

[07:23:36] <mybalzitch> that's great for an official support channel
[07:23:59] <bigpod> mybalzitch: and those instructions work i used rufus maybe a week ago without having to write in DD mode
[07:24:19] <mybalzitch> not on my asus board
[07:24:29] <mybalzitch> the installer boots, but it can't find the image to mount
[07:24:33] <mybalzitch> reboot and write with dd mode, works fine
[07:24:46] <mybalzitch> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:24:47] <bigpod> wierd

[07:27:07] <bigpod> wierd

[11:30:12] <ILoveAndrewLee> If I can offer a suggestion, I access my alt keys with left and right alt.
[11:30:25] <makara> ducasse: yes
[11:30:38] <ducasse> makara, why not use nfs?
[11:30:53] <thyriaen> ILoveAndrewLee, partly for vim, but partly in preperation of my UHK keyboard which does not have an esc key - so might aswell get used to it right now
[11:31:01] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: In order to make the right alt comfortable, I shifted over the right hand by one row. This also had the added benefit of making they keyboard symmetrical and more comfortable.

[11:32:29] <ILoveAndrewLee> Still cool though.
[11:32:56] <ducasse> makara, it has client-based security, so if the server allows you root access local root is root. very simple to set up, fast, much faster than sshfs

[11:36:02] <thyriaen> i have never looked at dvorak or anything apart from qwerty - i recently moved from qwertz layout to qwerty and started using 10 finger typing, got into vim and everything falls together now which is a good point of breaking bad habbits - before i was kinda a floating 6 finger typist just freestyling it
[11:36:03] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: ah I see the layout now. There are a lot of things I like about that layout. For one, the right alt is much more accessible to the right thumb. That should be your modifier key.
[11:37:02] <thyriaen> ILoveAndrewLee, yea, i don't know what keys to have which modifiers on it

[11:40:08] <thyriaen> it think its best to throw out everything you know at the same time so your brain can concentrate on new stuff and don't fall into old patterns
[11:40:11] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: okay that is good because the way I learned vim, is having to remap everything out for colemak. Its best to do that when you are fresh
[11:40:23] <makara> so im trying https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/25151/47987
[11:40:26] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: EXACTLY!
[11:40:44] <thyriaen> ILoveAndrewLee, what are the benefits of not using qwerty ?
[11:41:20] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: Comfort, and typing speed are the main ones. For example, if you were to compare typing a novel like war and peace on Colemak vs Qwerty,
[11:41:44] <ILoveAndrewLee> your fingers would travel like 3 miles less, and 50% less overall compared to qwerty.
[11:42:16] <ILoveAndrewLee> It prevents carpel tunnel syndrome, which I had bad under qwerty, where I had to literally rest from typing.
[11:43:09] <thyriaen> ILoveAndrewLee, while i do love stuff like that - my main concern is that it will give me an obstacle in the world to have a different layout - when i am at a different computer, typing on a friends laptop, id assume its quite awkward
[11:43:19] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: Those are the main ones. After that, my most important changes to they keyboard was to first make a Programmer's layout.
[11:43:50] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: Yeah, that will be pretty much impossible to deal with.
[11:44:31] <thyriaen> ILoveAndrewLee, i grew up with qwertz ( german layout ) and my main reason to switch to qwerty was to be more compatible with the world, for example when connecting to a server via ssh or just in general being on a pc in the university
[11:44:36] <ILoveAndrewLee> I have my own laptop, a thinkpad though, so it is almost never an issue. Sometimes it is though, but I don't think its worth the health of your fingers.
[11:45:16] <ILoveAndrewLee> thyriaen: Well the fact that you will have a hardware based keyboard, solves that issue for you.

[15:35:34] <mort> so, my understanding is that anyone can upload a snap for anything. For example, I could take something like the rustup program, package it as a snap, and submit it - and if no one else has done that, it will be installed by anyone who types `snap install rustup`. Is this correct?
[15:36:06] <mort> further, anyone who types `rustup` in their terminal would be adviced by the terminal to install my snap, right?
[15:36:16] <oerheks> mort, yes, if you claimed that name, they will
[15:36:29] <ogra> correct
[15:36:33] <mort> what are the processes in place to prevent me from uploading a rustup with malware for example?

[15:36:35] *** Quits: nizarus (~nizarus@ubuntu/member/nizarus) (Quit: Leaving)
[15:36:49] <mort> I mean rustup is claimed already, but for a package which isn't claimed yet
[15:36:52] <ogra> thogh note that "well known package names" are usually reserved by default  ...
[15:37:01] <ogra> so you would need to ask for the name explicitly
[15:37:19] <ogra> (typically packages that have a deb equivalent in the archive)
[15:37:37] <mort> right, so rustup probably isn't reserved then
[15:38:04] <ogra> the registration page has a "dispute this name" button or so ... that you can use to talk to the store people
[15:38:18] <oerheks> mort, see the snap developers page, how snaps are reviewed

[15:40:15] <mort> what specifically though would prevent me from making a snap of something like rakudobrew, include some subtle malware which is hard to catch through a quick manual review, uploading it to the snap store, and infiltrating the machines of everyone who follows apt's suggestion when they try to `apt install rakudobrew` and apt tells them "try snap
[15:40:15] <mort> install rakudobrew"
[15:41:03] <ogra> the builtin snap confinement would prevent you from doing that
[15:41:20] <ogra> all you could infiltrate is the snap sandbox
[15:41:25] <ogra> not the host
[15:41:28] <mort> not really, this would be a kind of snap which it would make sense to use classic confinement with
[15:41:46] <ogra> classic gets a full manual review
[15:41:54] <mort> apt would tell people, "do snap install rakudobrew", snap would tell people "do snap install --classic rakudobrew", people would do that and I would get their cryptocurrency wallets
[15:41:57] <ogra> so your malware would likely be found
[15:42:11] <mort> I wonder how thorough those reviews are

[21:55:24] <gt756> isn't it that you have to have right permissions on your mount point directory, first. Before mounting?
[21:56:38] <gt756> And if your mount failed, or you don't have access to mount point after mounting - your chmoding is useless. It neither goes to target, neither to mountpoint.

[21:59:57] <gt756> But of course that recursive chmodding will work if (and only after) mount was successful, and you can enter mount point dir. Even if it's weird to override all permissions to shared resource each time new user mounts it - it becomes stupid wars of users owning it.

[23:42:32] <sixwheeledbeast> sounds like a qtwebkit thing?

[23:43:00] <jfcaron> Looks like it was a backported Qt3 thing for Qt 4.1

[23:43:39] <tomreyn> Guest64: if "the machine" is a system running a supported Ubuntu release (see /topic) and by "putty into" you mean "connect to, through the ssh protocol, with the putty ssh client", then it's probably because the ssh server is not installed / running on the Ubuntu system, or due to unsuccessful authentication, or for lack of permissions.

[23:43:48] <jfcaron> So maybe I could set up a VM with an Ubuntu version that has Qt 4.1 in the repos.

[23:45:04] <tomreyn> Guest64: the error message you get threre may help narrowing this down more.
