[14:21:46] <Faux> When I used to work for the government, in 2013, we sunk months of engineering time into trying to speed something up because nobody would pay for a bigger DB server, which was the problem, and the DB server it was running on was worse than my laptop at the time.

[14:39:32] <Carbonflux> i guess people like that never just shrug, say "whatever..." and walk away.

[14:51:41] <Carbonflux> you think they will kill him? hm, he does seem to make some people quite angary.
[14:52:41] <Carbonflux> still, he seems to be broken in a way. Maybe thats just my impression. i just get the feeling all this was too intense for him.
