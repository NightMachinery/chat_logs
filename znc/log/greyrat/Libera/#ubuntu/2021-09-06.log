[03:04:09] <tomreyn> ravage: is there a way for an isp to override which apt sources will be used for "$release-security" that you know of?
[03:04:49] <ravage> You can modify the DNS records
[03:04:53] <privato89> Sure, I tried but it sais I have to update first all packages
[03:05:00] <ravage> But other than that not really

[04:06:38] <privato89> I dont know how to thank you, would like to give you a cup of coffee if you like :D
[04:06:54] <tomreyn> you should carefully review this list and uninstall the packages you don't need. and for those you still need, you should fine an apt repository (or snap) providing updated versions of it

[04:19:26] <leftyfb> privato89: Ubuntu 20.04 is the latest LTS release. It'll be supported for another 4 years. 21.04 will be unsupported next month
[04:19:56] <privato89> oh I idn't know that
[04:20:01] <tomreyn> yes, you'd have to upgrade again next month then
[04:20:03] <privato89> didn't*
[04:20:06] <tomreyn> !LTS
[04:20:06] <ubottu> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions are supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Focal (Focal Fossa 20.04). Ubuntu !flavors may have different support durations, check their release notes for information.
[04:20:47] <privato89> ok, Thanks for the info
[04:21:03] <privato89> Now that I know it I think I stay with Focal
[04:21:04] <tomreyn> someone wrote up a longer story on this here https://gist.github.com/tomreyn/8d7675840d7bc7389b32e4d8887ca449
[04:21:44] <tomreyn> (though that's mostly about HWE vs GA)
[04:21:53] <tomreyn> so, off to bed, see you, privato89
[04:21:58] <privato89> Does the termbin files delete after a while? Or can I save it on my
[04:22:13] <privato89> bookmarks
[04:22:19] <tomreyn> they'll be removed after a while, a month i think
[04:22:36] <privato89> ok, thank you so much Tom
[04:22:43] <privato89> Have a good night
[04:22:58] <privato89> see you soon I hope, saluti dall'Italia :D
[04:23:04] <tomreyn> "Life span of single paste is one month. Older pastes are deleted." (Source: https://termbin.com/ )
[04:23:08] <srv> isnt 21.04 the latest LTS
[04:23:11] <tomreyn> :)
[04:23:14] <tomreyn> srv: no
[04:23:30] <tomreyn> 21.04 is not an LTS
[04:23:41] <tomreyn> those release every two years, in even years

[14:23:02] <alkisg> "apt" is a command line program, so it's strange that you say you "click on it"

[14:52:42] <Phalanxer> Hey all!
[14:53:42] <Phalanxer> So I am trying to get PostgreSQL working but having a problem because the maintainers of Ubuntu's PostgreSQL decided to hack it up and not bother documenting the changes.
[14:54:06] <Phalanxer> The documentation hasn't even been updated for 6 years, for real.
[14:55:12] <Phalanxer> So according to PostgreSQL's documentation, I need to use the program 'pg_ctl' to send the 'SIGTERM' signal to the master postgres process. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/server-shutdown.html
[14:56:00] <Phalanxer> The problem is, Ubuntu's hacked up PostgreSQL version does not have the 'pg_ctl' program in it, and no one bothered documenting how sending the 'SIGTERM' signal to the master postgres process can be done.
[14:56:06] <Phalanxer> Does anyone know how it can be done?

[22:31:10] <FaTaL_gg> I have been signing in now in irc for a few years. much help here; you have all helped on many issues. One that I still have (since 16.04, and still in my 20.04), is; whenever I have to restart the computer, isc-dhcp-server fails to start. I can issue a restart of it, and then it works usually..... until the next power failure

[23:07:26] <crabapple> hi. I also asked this question on the main lubuntu channel but I will re-ask it here, because this seems more active. I have been trying to find a good os for my powermac g4, and lubuntu 16.04 for powerpc seems great. I have spent some time searching, but have not found an iso; the one on the downloads page is a dead link. any help would be appreciated.
[23:09:35] <tomreyn> crabapple: it won't get more than no support here either, it's dead, end of life, unsupported. and i provided a magnet link there if you still want to try your luck.
