[14:49:11] <bagder> 17.5% of the committers who ever authored code in lib/ have no traces of their code left in master
[14:49:31] <bagder> that's 109 persons
[14:49:41] <bagder> there are code in lib/ from 515 persons right now
[14:49:45] <icing> so, you are below 1000 again?
[14:50:03] <bagder> this is just counting people that "git blame" finds in current lib/
[14:52:00] <bagder> I've written 49.29% of current lib/
[14:52:09] <gevaerts> Right, but git blame of course is at line resolution. If two people fix different parts of one line, one of them will be gone
[14:52:14] <icing> the good parts.
[14:52:17] <bagder> gevaerts: indeed
[14:52:51] <gevaerts> e.g. someone fixes an off-by-one in an argument to malloc, and then someone else comes in and decides we need Curl_malloc :)
[14:52:55] <bagder> and I get unfair credit for having added a lot of file headers I think
[14:53:21] <bagder> this counts all lines, including blanks and comments
[14:53:55] <bagder> gevaerts: you're at 39 lines
[14:53:56] <icing>  I'll make a nice PR with blank lines...
[14:54:08] <bagder> icing: 17
[14:54:36] <gevaerts> 39 is an exact multiple of my favourite number!
[14:55:18] <icing> how come that gavaerts has more lines them me?
[14:55:25] <icing> *than
[14:55:52] <bagder> I'm afraid my script doesn't figure that out!
[14:57:36] <gevaerts> It's probably because real bugfixes tend to be fewer lines than all over the place minor things :)
[14:58:13] <icing> I suspect bagder reworked my PR just to reduce the line count.
[14:58:39] <bagder> my secret is out!
[14:59:35] <icing> many people want to prove that not everything is about me!
[15:05:51] <gevaerts> The real question is, how many empty lines has bagder added, and does he have a higher or lower percentage than other people? :)
[15:07:06] <dege_> and can we have a libcurl version with just those lines?
[15:07:26] <icing> libcurl could be a one-liner!
[15:08:17] <icing> ok, maybe a two-liner with a header file.
[15:10:02] <icing> otoh, those empty lines are suspiciously CVE-free...

[16:33:24] <bagder> actually makefiles, but autoreconf'ed I mean
[16:33:54] <bagder> `Curl_pseudo_headers' comes from lib/h2h3.c which is a rather new file
[16:33:57] <sharpobject> uh yes, I am following the instructions at https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HTTP3.md so I begin with no curl folder, I clone curl, autoreconf, configure, and make

[17:40:59] <sharpobject> so I will try with something other than quiche
[17:40:59] <bagder> :-/
[17:42:00] <sharpobject> in my case, it reliably fails with curl --http3 --compressed "https://api.tardis.dev/v1/data-feeds/bybit?from=2021-09-01&offset=124" -o /dev/null (cloudflare ends up sending gzip, so you probably don't need to build with brotli for this)
[17:42:12] <sharpobject> but reliably succeeds if you don't pass --compressed!
[17:42:31] <bagder> oh
[17:42:35] <bagder> I'll try here
[17:42:53] <icing> someone messing up Content-Length?
[17:45:17] <bagder> it doesn't support HEAD...
[17:45:29] <bagder> and it repeatedly "hangs" for me even without --compressed
