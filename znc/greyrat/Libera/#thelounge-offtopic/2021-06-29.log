[00:20:53] <printf> bookworm do u use miniflux personally
[00:21:05] <bookworm> why else would I recommend it? ;)
[00:21:30] <printf> but yea, i guess im a little concerned with storage sizes, 
[00:21:31] <bookworm> if you'd rather have a php app, tiniy tiny rss or whatever works too
[00:21:41] <printf> thats why i kept asking about pruning logs
[00:22:00] <bookworm> well for starters get rid of the text logs if you still have them
[00:22:17] <bookworm> btw, TL stuff can stay on the main channel, RSS readers not so much
[00:22:45] <printf> ill try RSS as an alterntaive to ##news i guess
[00:23:12] <bookworm> news is the shittiest version of an RSS reader you've ever seen
[00:23:28] <printf> yea i only read like probably 0.01% of the news on ##news
[00:23:40] <bookworm> RSS readers allow you to follow specific RSS feeds that *you* choose.
[00:23:44] <printf> but its nice that at least u get stuff from different sources so it's not biased
[00:23:59] <bookworm> you can subscribe to the very same sources if you want
[00:24:17] <bookworm> but also get rid of stuff like fox because that's not mews but satire
[00:24:40] <bookworm> excuse me, fake news ;P
[00:24:54] <printf> lol yea i dont read fox anyway
[00:25:00] <printf> lol
[00:25:55] <bookworm> there's also quite a bunch of interesting linux related feeds... planet.kernel.org, the freedesktop people, quite a bunch of maintainers blogs (curl, git...)
[00:26:12] <bookworm> it's really worth it to be able to curate your own frontpage
[00:26:55] <printf> this might be related to TL again: ive already left ##news already so if i dont have ##news anymore i guess 1GB storage is enought right?
[00:27:07] <bookworm> depends
[00:27:37] <bookworm> you store things like status messages too, so if you are in channels like #linux it can add up
[00:28:12] <printf> i kinda want like a metanews feed where i can read on desktop, mobile and in the terminal, which is why i opted for IRC 
[00:28:16] <bookworm> but to be honest, just monitor it and if you see that it becomes a problem prune the db and vacuum
[00:28:25] <printf> but i think RSS is designed for it
[00:28:28] <bookworm> yes, miniflux ;P
[00:29:03] <bookworm> https://labrat.space/irc/324a6518caf486ad/Screenshot_20210628-215837.png 
[00:29:13] <bookworm> mobile version
[00:29:20] <bookworm> it's a pwa, same as TL
[00:29:42] <printf> looks cool
[00:29:59] <printf> let me check if theres a helm chart for it
[00:30:58] <bookworm> you do need to install postgres though
[00:31:07] <printf> how muc storage do u recomend for miniflux
[00:31:17] <bookworm> depends on what you wanna store
[00:31:31] <bookworm> you can store full text or just the headers
[00:32:05] <bookworm> I don't use a toaster but have like 30GB of space or so, so far I don't have any issues and I've run it for a year or two
[00:32:38] <bookworm> then again, if it becomes a problem I'll just host it on my NAS instead of the VPS
[00:33:24] <printf> i have a 1TB ssd , and im deciding how much PVC storage i should give it
[00:34:03] <bookworm> why give it a limit at all?
[00:34:04] <printf> techically i have lots of spaces left but i want to give it a sensible amount, not too much not too little
[00:34:25] <bookworm> just use it, limit things when you have to and not by default
