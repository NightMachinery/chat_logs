[14:49:23] <kjetilho> braxas: my response was to "AFAIK the only thing that exists  that is not considered obsolete that  defines what a URL is, is https://url.spec.whatwg.org/"
[14:49:37] <kjetilho> but I guess it depends on your definition of "defines" :)
[14:50:51] <braxas> kjetilho: fair enough, in some sense that does define what it is, in that  it is a subset of URIs, but it gives no constraint that allows me to determine if a specific URI is inside that subset or outside that subset.
[14:51:43] <kjetilho> I would argue it does
[14:53:34] <kjetilho> not in the form of an ABNF, or anything a computer can parse, though.  it needs a flag or more metadata about each uri scheme.
[14:53:42] <sobel> the spec does not constrain much. i can understand how that might seem like an uncomfortably vague spec but it's definitive.
[14:53:59] <braxas> well if you take that fairly loose constraint, then okay, it is a URL, but if you take https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ which purports to define what a URL is, then jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database does not qualify as an absolute URL
[14:54:14] <sobel> that's a DB URI

[14:55:08] <braxas> anyway, I'm going to  use https://github.com/xo/dburl and how that defines a postgres URL
[14:55:50] <sobel> the 2 forms dburl claims to support are not of the form jdbc:vendor://...
[14:56:01] <ilmari> it's a jdbc URI that contains a postgresql URL :)
[14:56:03] <sobel> it looks to be using URL format
[14:56:30] <braxas> ilmari: that is a fair interpretation IMO
[14:56:35] <ilmari> or a JDBC DSN (data source name)
[14:56:37] <sobel> example from the site itself: postgres://user:pass@localhost/dbname
[14:56:48] <sobel> a valid URL
[14:57:24] <braxas> yes but I actually just want a way to refer to a postgres using a URL in Go - I thought I would have to write a way but then I found dburl, now I'm using that
[14:57:26] *** Joins: G_SabinoMullane (~G_SabinoM@pool-72-94-251-236.phlapa.fios.verizon.net)
[14:57:59] <sobel> using URIs and URLs for databases is entirely up to each library to support. i'm not aware of a ton of standardization around this approach, but i do like it a lot.
[14:58:20] <sobel> it makes great sense to have a reliable way to bundle the whole connection detail
[14:58:47] <sobel> but in my experience, some apps use URIs, some use URLs, and some claim but fail to use URIs/URLs
[14:59:27] <sobel> and some make you fill out a form with all the details. so the concept of 'a postgres url' is not really very portable.
[14:59:35] <ilmari> others use key=value strings, with varying separators
[15:00:05] <sobel> then there's all the connection parameters which jdbc and probably others append browser-url-style
[15:00:26] <sobel> now you get to deal with &amp; in your connection string. fun!
[15:00:37] <ilmari> only if you put it in html
[15:00:47] <sobel> because you KNOW someone is gonna copy a url off an internal wiki and go
[15:00:48] <ilmari> ITYM %26
[15:00:54] <sobel> %20
[15:01:22] <ilmari> or %2F if you're using unix sockets
[15:01:23] <sobel> oh i mean to imply every encoding that should not make it back into the config file will find its way there
[15:01:30] <sobel> :)
[15:02:06] <sobel> it's just a side effect of idiot-proofing, which is where i get when i go down the DB URI path too far

[19:03:19] <ne2k>  The precision of a numeric is the total count of significant digits in the whole number, that is, the number of digits to both sides of the decimal point. The scale of a numeric is the count of decimal digits in the fractional part, to the right of the decimal point. So the number 23.5141 has a precision of 6 and a scale of 4.

[19:05:33] <ne2k> I feel as though it would be worthwhile this section of documentation specifically stating that this relates to decimal representation. it says it implicitly, in the sense that it refers to decimal points, but it ought to lead by making it explicit, imo. after all, a "number" is not in any particular base, it's just a number
[19:08:39] <ne2k> the type "decimal" already makes this pretty clear
[19:09:42] <ne2k> actually, maybe it's already clear; if you start reading at the top of the page, it says they are "decimal" types.

[22:14:17] <AndreK77> Im converting a system from MSSQL to postgresql and there is one trigger that is just killing my brain:D Â an for update trigger that sets a column (row_updated)='Y' if the row has been updated since last time data was updated other wise it is set to NULL. The script that does this does a series of updates and inserts starting with setting the
[22:14:18] <AndreK77> row_updated=NULL in the same transaction, and Im guessing that is what is messing things up. Does any one have any experience on this kind of flagging (row_updated since last run) in postgresql

[22:26:16] <Myon> is that simply the inverse of create trigger ... before update of "row_updated" ?
[22:27:14] <Myon> what exactly does "IF NOT UPDATE(ROW_UPDATED)" do?
[22:27:38] <Myon> to me that looks like "is this trigger run touching the ROW_UPDATED column?"
[22:29:03] <AndreK77> it excludes that coumn from check if rowÂ  was updated
[22:29:48] <Myon> so it doesn't do any "was this row updated since $sometime" check

[23:05:50] <Kobaz> haven't gotten into 13 or 14 yet
[23:06:12] <ilmari> no, the guarantee is across queries, and across sessions
[23:06:22] <ilmari> there is no guarantee as to how often it will actually be invoked
[23:06:29] <Kobaz> we've seen a signifigant performance difference between stable and immutable... so we've been using immutable
[23:06:47] <Kobaz> really what we want.. is immutable per-query
[23:06:59] <Kobaz> but we can't use stable since it's too slow
[23:07:16] <Kobaz> it queries it more than once per query, even if it's stable

[23:12:38] <Kobaz> we're not having any problems with how we're doing it... it works 100% predictably with IMMUTABLE... and the new values always come through
[23:12:48] <Kobaz> just concerned about that behavior might be 'fixed' in new versions
[23:12:59] <ilmari> you're still lying to the database, so if it breaks you get to keep both parts
[23:15:26] <johto> why not just pass filter_get() as variable to the function?
[23:15:40] <ilmari> johto: it's a view, not a function
[23:15:41] <johto> oh, you're not actually using SQL language functions
[23:15:46] <ilmari> but making it a function might work better
[23:15:47] <johto> because you didn't like the boilerplate?
[23:15:52] <johto> I think I'd rather take the boilerplate in this case
[23:16:02] <johto> but not my data..
[23:16:36] <ilmari> with param as (current_setting('foo.bar') bar) baz select ... from ..., param where whatever = param.bar;
[23:16:43] <Kobaz> yeah
[23:17:33] <ilmari> `with param as materialized (...)` to avoid folding it into the main query
[23:18:09] <Kobaz> so in the case of a prepared query being just executed... then it will query that for the value every execution?
[23:18:10] <ilmari> there was a proposed patch to cache/pre-evaluate stable functions with constant arguments, but that stalled in 2019
