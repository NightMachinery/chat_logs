[16:18:35] <very_sneaky> does anybody have any strong opinions in the gitlab ci vs jenkins debate?
[16:20:40] <SanT`aZClown> both are slow as fuck
[16:20:58] <very_sneaky> slow? in what way?
[16:21:44] <very_sneaky> I've got an instance of each running atm, both seem reasonably snappy - i liked that gitlab ci was able to parallelise jobs in docker runners on the single build agent
[16:23:20] <Oxyd> Jenkins is absolute garbage.
[16:23:29] <Crocodillian> can either do msvc builds
[16:23:55] <very_sneaky> yeah, both can do msvc/msbuild builds - just need to provide the appropriate build agents
[16:23:55] <Crocodillian> I was using appveyor before which was absolute garbage and I deleted it
[16:24:21] <very_sneaky> but that is actually a good one to test. I should see what the windows build agent experience is like
[16:24:50] <Crocodillian> to make things worse, I am using vcpkg instead of conan which made almost every ci run build ffmpeg and take fucking forever
[16:24:58] <very_sneaky> Oxyd: what don't you like about jenkins?
[16:25:14] <very_sneaky> Crocodillian: have you used conan?
[16:25:18] <Oxyd> Groovy, for one thing.
[16:25:27] <Crocodillian> not yet but I am going to convert our shit to conan
[16:25:36] <Crocodillian> because conan actually has binary packages
[16:25:57] <very_sneaky> interesting - i didn't realise vcpkg was source builds only
[16:26:07] <very_sneaky> i've been using conan and have really liked it so far
[16:27:07] <SanT`aZClown> that's a bit barbarian
[16:27:12] <very_sneaky> Oxyd: i've never heard of groovy before - is this a language?
[16:37:29] <Crocodillian> very_sneaky: it's a jvm language
[16:37:50] <very_sneaky> gotcha
[16:39:02] <very_sneaky> i'm still in the process of getting things set up on jenkins, but gitlab-ci was pretty neat. Was cool to have it build my project with 6 different configs simultaneously and deploy all of those as conan packages to artifactory
[16:56:58] <dukwon> i run physics analysis code and compile documents and presentations on gitlab CI
[17:20:08] <very_sneaky> dukwon: any pain points?
[17:22:51] <dukwon> yes but they're all to do with making it play nicely with our weird software (cvmfs, xrootd/eos)
[17:24:11] <very_sneaky> heh, those do look like some niche requirements
[17:25:09] <dukwon> we have shared runners with cvmfs mounted already, so the only awkward thing is using singularity with the "unpacked container images" that can be found on there
[17:25:25] <dukwon> but that's a corner-case of something already very niche
[17:26:30] <dukwon> basically when we need to run parts of our stack in the same job that span more than 2 versions of Scientific/CentOS
[17:27:01] <dukwon> which we shouldn't really be doing in the CI
[17:27:48] <dukwon> but i do it to scrape documentation out of many versions of the same application
[17:31:58] <very_sneaky> have you tried any other ci tools?
[17:37:41] <dukwon> not really
