[14:31:49] <southclaws> it's funny how there's a big bunch of RFCs for how documents should look on the web and then the RFC format just ignores it all
[14:32:30] <southclaws> like,  browsers wrap text and make things fit nicely on screen,  but no...  RFCs just make everything monospace and do wrapping manually haha
[14:33:19] <rhn_mk1> I managed to find https://pypi.org/project/id2xml/ and massage the RFC to a form that it accepted, but then I'm too lazy to figure out how to run the HTML converter written in Ruby https://github.com/mislav/rfc/blob/master/rfc.rb
[14:33:20] <mockturtle> [ rfc/rfc.rb at master · mislav/rfc ] - github.com
[14:34:06] <southclaws> kinda would be neat if it was just a simple markdown doc but i get that rfcs go back decades
[14:34:47] <rhn_mk1> southclaws: there is a certain subculture among the experienced computer experts where if you didn't know better you'd assume all they have access to is a teletype machine or at most a monochrome CRT display the size of a plate
[14:35:03] <epilys> rhn_mk1, you should run timing tests and see if setting up the RFC to be read takes more time than actually reading the RFC
[14:35:11] <southclaws> haha I totally get that sometimes
[14:35:37] <rhn_mk1> epilys: I already know the answer, and it's the same with almost any "simple" thing I try to do :F

[14:36:30] <southclaws> another gripe: monospace typefaces are not optimised for readability,  serif typefaces are the most efficient for read speed

[14:37:27] <rhn_mk1> I want this to catch on so badly. No more tabs vs spaces wars
[14:37:54] <rhn_mk1> sadly, implementing it is actually more complicated than it sounds
[14:39:35] <southclaws> I don't even get the need for a "war"
[14:39:43] <southclaws> just use whatever's there,  use a code formatter
[14:40:09] <southclaws> I've not touched my tab key for indentation in a decade...  autoformat,  black,  gofmt,  prettier, etc...
[14:40:09] <epilys> yeah that's obsolete stuff
[14:40:19] <epilys> the world has moved on, old timers
[14:40:24] <rhn_mk1> we're not there yet tho
[14:40:38] <southclaws> the only time i ever manually indented code was for an old language i still mess with sometimes (Pawn)
[14:40:41] <epilys> btw, that's how lengths are defined in TeX: a unit plus/minus stretch values
[14:41:04] <rhn_mk1> also, code formatters need to be separate for each language, whereas tabstops are universal
[14:41:11] <southclaws> this is why I like Go,  there's one indentation method and that's it, no room for discussion
[14:41:14] <rhn_mk1> heck, they even make markdown tables not suck
[14:42:17] <epilys> in vim I defined tab as 4 spaces, use :retab automatically whenever I open something with tabs => never have to think about tabs ever
[14:42:38] <rhn_mk1> I see you're not writing makefiles
[14:42:53] <epilys> the tabs are preserved in makefiles

[14:47:34] <southclaws> Taskfile does what I need: tasks with dependencies,  watch a directory for changes and execute tasks,  works on any platform without messing around installing loads of stuff
[14:48:02] <rhn_mk1> it uses make or something make-ish underneath for sure
[14:48:03] <southclaws> rhn_mk1: mtime?
[14:48:11] <rhn_mk1> you're not building from scratch every time
[14:48:17] <rhn_mk1> modification time
[14:48:23] <southclaws> modification of files?
[14:48:26] <rhn_mk1> for a file on the file ssytem
[14:48:33] <southclaws> ah,  the sort of stuff I do doesn't always mean files get output
[14:48:45] <southclaws> sometimes it's an API call,  a CLI tool being called,  a database migration,  etc
[14:48:49] <epilys> it's a filesystem attribute programs can set to show the last time you modified something
[14:48:52] <rhn_mk1> fair enough
[14:48:58] <southclaws> right,  yeah not always applicable
[14:49:04] <epilys> so you can compare the source file mtime vs the executable mtime
[14:49:17] <rhn_mk1> the general concept is totally applicable for a database migration tho
[14:49:21] <epilys> rhn_mk1, heart seems in the right place re: goals but that syntax is terrible
[14:49:29] <southclaws> since I do web stuff,  sometimes code gets generated but the incremental stuff is handled by the tools for that language, not my task runner
[14:49:46] <southclaws> an in Go, you generate a binary, but --watch means it just incrementally recompiles on changes
[14:50:00] <rhn_mk1> yeah I'm not a huge fan of that. I tried tup as well, and it's not great either
[14:50:13] <southclaws> and the Go compiler handles incremental builds anyway,  so if you build the same source twice,, it will be clever - so again,  job of the compiler, not the task runner in that case
[14:50:32] <rhn_mk1> there you go, that's what make does. a task runner doesn't compete with make in any way
[14:50:39] <epilys> sounds like it does the same thing under the hood: mtime checking and building a topological sort of building units

[14:50:47] <rhn_mk1> so you're not really using it "instead" of make
[14:50:49] <southclaws> I guess so, not really a "competitor" just a different tool
[14:51:07] <southclaws> maybe previous jobs/projects other people just used Make wrongly
[14:51:26] <southclaws> people basically just used it as a task runner,  but I remember working with env vars was a pain for whatever reason
[14:51:42] <southclaws> Taskfile reads a .env file which is handy and then injects those values into commands, which I find useful!
[14:51:43] <rhn_mk1> people do use "make test" and stuff like that with phony targets, which is abuse of make
[14:52:15] <southclaws> I guess it's really designed with C in mind, right?
[14:52:32] <southclaws> because interpreted languages don't output new files, they just do their work and exit
[14:52:33] <rhn_mk1> no, if anything, it's designed with bash
[14:53:13] <rhn_mk1> make's task is to change the state of a system and has nothing to do with the language used

[14:53:31] <rhn_mk1> epilys: I gave up
[14:53:47] <southclaws> yeah but I mean it seems like all the features work super well with languages like C,  but don't quite apply to the sort of stuff I use
