[16:33:19] <ManiacOfMadness> Hello everyone! I've been using org-mode for a while to clock my work tasks, and my employee would like to see the tasks I've clocked on a Google Calendar instance. Has anyone worked on this before? I think I may have to tinker with the inner workings of org-gcal eventually.
[16:46:57] <konubinix> In my experience, the kind of data my employer wants is coarser than what I clock into org-mode
[16:48:00] <konubinix> I generally end up just filling the timesheet manually
[16:48:47] <konubinix> Also, I don't know in your case, but in general my org-clock stuff are my real time, while my employers generally want the timesheet to reflect stuff that correspond to the bills
[16:49:46] <konubinix> I mean, the clocked task reflect the "real" time. The official timesheets reflect the time the employer wants to believe in
[16:50:24] <konubinix> Last time I tried converting org clock tasks to official timesheet, I was asked to change them to fit the expectation (50% on this project, 25% on that other project etc)
[16:50:46] <konubinix> Not answering your question per se, just adding some possible food for thoughts

[17:38:11] <asus> Have a look to the example I made : https://paste.chapril.org/?69d00d81eb4da694#6VSuScWazd1ou2sSwuC7oEk7Z4yzgtSzTzizi78nkh7u
[17:40:05] <Demosthenex> asus: don't use deadline for the appt time, use an active timestamp in the body of the heading
[17:41:32] <ManiacOfMadness> konubinix: Quite right, my employer would like me to allocate time in my schedule to tasks in order to have an average of the time I spent to each client. It's just that I'm not used in pre-allocating time on tasks/clients, since I can't yet predict how much time something will take.
[17:41:35] <asus> Do you mean I should just write the dates by hand ? i.e. "TODO call dentist <YYYY-MM-DD>
[17:41:58] <asus> (Demosthenex)
[17:42:18] <ManiacOfMadness> Still, it is indeed food for thought, as it may be more productive for me to split the day in such portions. I'll give it some thought!
[17:42:34] <asus> How is that conceptually different from setting a deadline ?
[17:45:48] <Demosthenex> asus: you should read about timestamps.
[17:46:01] <Demosthenex> https://orgmode.org/manual/Timestamps.html
[17:46:27] <ManiacOfMadness> Demosthenex: That's an interesting approach! Though I would still like avoid manual time allocation, even though it looks to be the most approachable solution to the problem.
[17:46:37] <Demosthenex> timestamps are used anywhere you like. deadlines and scheduled are a special kind of timestamp
[17:47:02] <Demosthenex> ManiacOfMadness: i use inactive timestamps. i take notes nonstop and i insert inactive timestamps everytime i switch tasks or leave/return
[17:47:10] <Demosthenex> and i bill customers with this information
[17:47:23] <Demosthenex> yes, i manually tally it monthly, but that's because different customers have different terms
[17:47:28] <Demosthenex> ie: minimum hours etc
[17:48:08] <Demosthenex> ironically i enter the hours into an org-mode table, which i use elisp to enter into a timecard via rest api on my invoice SaaS site
[17:49:36] <ManiacOfMadness> Any reason you use inactive timestamps instead of clocking? It seems easier to point and click to a headline and press C-c,C-x,C-i every time I need to switch a task.
[17:51:24] <bkhl[m]> The stuff inserted by org-clock includes timestamps.
[17:53:05] <Demosthenex> that's true
[17:53:11] <Demosthenex> but my work doesn't align well to clocking
[17:53:21] <Demosthenex> and i don't need to make per minute details on tasks
[17:53:33] <Demosthenex> generally, if i log something, its 1-4 hours surrounding the item
[17:53:39] <Demosthenex> and again contract terms differ by project
[17:53:48] <Demosthenex> clocking is too strict
[17:53:57] <Demosthenex> maybe someday i'll migrate to it
[17:54:07] <Demosthenex> in the mean time, frequently clocking inactive timestamps gives me a full timeline
[17:54:19] <Demosthenex> anytime a customer wants justification, i sent them an agenda like that
[17:54:24] <Demosthenex> and they instantly accept
[17:56:18] <Demosthenex> i credit org-mode with much of my career success. it's ironic how many of my customers tell me i'm the most organized consultant they know, and i'm the one with adhd and mild autism scrambling to record it all in org. ;]
[17:58:22] <asus> >anytime a customer wants justification, i sent them an agenda like that 
[17:58:32] <asus> Demosthenex, Can you show us an example please ?
[18:00:33] <ManiacOfMadness> "anytime a customer wants justification, i sent them an agenda like that" <-- That's pure "Malicious Compliance" content. :D

[18:49:18] <asus> Demosthenex, thank you for your resource
[18:49:33] <asus> it fixed my first point, but the other still applies!
[18:49:57] <asus> I did an example with timestamps instead of deadline for you to see
[18:49:59] <asus> https://paste.chapril.org/?61f4a59f7692e633#J8km3Bust4jd4J3rfuZyLCJq9FbZivctLBWxGkyieRu7
[18:50:46] *** Joins: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag)
[18:54:27] <Demosthenex> asus: i'm glad you fixed #1, i don't understand #2
[18:56:35] <asus> Well, both entries are related to taking an appointment for the dentist right ?
[18:57:03] <Demosthenex> that's how you organized your outline, not org's timestamps
[18:57:13] <Demosthenex> if you see those as 2 tasks, then they are
[18:57:31] <asus> I'm looking for a way to make them 1 task
[18:57:41] <Demosthenex> let me make a suggestion
[18:57:55] <asus> please do 
[18:58:25] <Demosthenex> make "call dentist" be a scheduled item, with a start date. that way in agenda it'll show up every day until you do it starting on the date you specify. then when you mark it done the repeat interval will be used to set the next time you should call
[18:58:41] <Demosthenex> let it log when it happened (logdone), but no point in scheduling the call as an appointment
[18:58:52] <Demosthenex> then when you have a doc appt, put the timestamp into the doctor entry
[18:59:01] <Demosthenex> that's an actual appointment with a time 
[18:59:19] <Demosthenex> no need to have repeating timestamps on the doc appt
[18:59:29] <Demosthenex> you just keep recording subsequent appointments and their results in the same heading
[18:59:39] <Demosthenex> and use the call as the scheduled action to trigger you to setup the doc
[19:00:37] <asus> this looks promising !!!
[19:00:55] <asus> it's true that "SCHEDULED" is better suited for the call part
[19:00:56] <Demosthenex> as you gain experience understanding what features do in org, you can make smart choices about how to organize your data to your liking
[19:01:24] <asus> yeah, it's a bit overwhelming at first
[19:01:58] <asus> I'm using it for a bit now, but, I did not take the time to optimize things, as you may have noticed
[19:02:45] <Demosthenex> that's fine, like any powerful tool there is a learning curve
[19:02:59] <asus> So, IIUC, there's no point in setting a "TODO" item for the actual appointment right ?
[19:03:10] <Demosthenex> and you'll only learn by doing, by trying to organize your stuff. and comparing notes with others helps, thats why we're here =]
[19:03:21] <Demosthenex> no, i think you leave the appt as a todo
[19:03:47] <Demosthenex> but when you set an active timestamp for the appt, mark it as TODO, and after you go take some notes and mark it DONE
[19:03:58] <Demosthenex> the call item will be TODO, but the doc appt will be DONE
[19:04:26] <Demosthenex> then next year, when you are reminded to call by the SCHEDULED call, you can change the doc appt to TODO again (preserving the logdone history), and add an active timestamp for the next appt
[19:04:51] <Demosthenex> after you go, mark it DONE again
[19:05:10] <Demosthenex> you will have a history of past active timestamps in your notes, and the logdone drawer
[19:18:42] <asus> Demosthenex, so the "go to dentist" should be a sub level of the "call dentist" headline right ?

[19:32:07] <Demosthenex> not neccesarily, but that works if you like
[19:35:09] <asus> Are you sure it is not necessarily ? Because if I don't make the appointment a headline, I can't give it the TODO keyword. Also, the appt will show in agenda as it's parent headline "call the dentist"

[20:07:27] <asus> sachac, You are right, but that's not my point : I said that without a headline (i.e. : **), one cannot make a "TODO" keyword
[20:08:09] <asus> mysterydough[m], thank you for your precision, this looks logical indeed
[20:09:13] <Demosthenex> asus: the todo/scheduled etc are heading metadata, those must always be there

[20:09:31] <Demosthenex> asus: i don't see a reason to prefer a subheading for the doc appt or a sibling
[20:09:40] <asus> My point is : what would be another way ?
[20:10:04] <Demosthenex> asus: they must both be headings.
[20:10:12] <Demosthenex> what order they are in doesn't matter
[20:10:26] <Demosthenex> they are independent in org's perspective, just related in your eyes
[20:16:00] <asus> Demosthenex, > i don't see a reason to prefer a subheading for the doc appt or a sibling
[20:16:14] <asus> IIUC, you mean it can just be a regular heading, right ?
[20:17:03] <Demosthenex> yes  
[20:17:24] <asus> you know what ? I'm gonna make a heading "dentist", in which will lie 2 subheading, being a) the call and b) the appt
[20:17:31] <asus> this is more logical in my eyes
[20:18:13] <asus> this way when I fold the "dentist" task, everything related to the dentist is hidden
[20:19:07] <Demosthenex> sure
[20:19:12] <Demosthenex> headings happen, often
[20:22:08] <mysterydough[m]> Another option is to have a separate datetree file for appointments. 
[20:22:08] <mysterydough[m]> After your call you would use capture to put the appointment in your appt file using a capture template for appointments. 
[20:23:00] *** Joins: Sario (uid356235@fosshost/cdo/Sario)

[20:24:24] <mysterydough[m]> It’s just organizing by type of item (todo vs appt), rather than category or theme.
[20:26:47] <asus> I think I got it. Like a file dedicated to appointments. A file that would be automatically written to when I use the capture option
[20:27:39] <asus> Can I create such a file afterwards ? Like, can I include all my previous appt in a datetree file ? mysterydough[m] 
[20:27:41] <tyson2> mysterydough[m]: Is there a good source for trusted capture templates?  I have had some issues with the ones that I created.
[20:32:24] <mysterydough[m]> asus: Technically yes, but I’ve never refiled in bulk into a datetree. There might be existing tools. 
[20:33:03] <Demosthenex> tyson2: capture templates are really use specific.

[20:33:11] <asus> looks like a nice option anyway, satetrees are fun
[20:33:43] <Demosthenex> asus: regarding datetree, it's a matter of preference. a datetree file is primarily organized by date. i organize my org files and headings by topic, and use agenda to navigate and report on dates
[20:34:42] <Demosthenex> i also never use the org archive option, because it refiles as a datetree :P
[20:34:52] <Demosthenex> i do move old items out to an archive file, but i do so manually
[20:35:14] <Demosthenex> at infrequent intervals
[20:35:48] <asus> For now, I also organize by topic
[20:36:05] <asus> but isn't your arhcive file a mess ?
[20:36:27] <asus> Demosthenex, 
[20:36:58] <Demosthenex> asus: why would it be?
[20:37:13] <Demosthenex> i find it irritating that org-archive wants to reorganize my file by date
[20:37:18] <Demosthenex> it breaks up the continuity
[20:37:33] <Demosthenex> who cares if i paid the light bill after an error 4 years ago, my notes for that are a block, so i just cut that out and paste it into an archive.

[23:14:32] <asus> Demosthenex, do you have different files for your medical / professionnal / friends appointments ?
[23:15:26] <asus> I would'nt want to find myself having too many levels of headings (i.e. ******)
[23:30:39] <Demosthenex> asus: i have an org file for personal data, biz data, and one per project
[23:30:57] <Demosthenex> and i don't avoid headings. they are the atomic element of org files
[23:31:01] <Demosthenex> i spam headings
[23:31:09] <Demosthenex> because i think in hierarchial ways
[23:31:35] <Demosthenex> as to levels, yes, i try to stay within 5-6 levels of headlines
[23:31:44] <Demosthenex> not to get too deep
[23:31:56] <asus> I see, I try to avoid going too deep 
[23:31:59] <asus> yeah
[23:32:31] <asus> Would you put the dentist in professionnal or personal ?
[23:32:33] <Demosthenex> otoh, i work with big files alot (like today), and if i need to focus on something, i use org-tree-to-indirect-buffer to open the tree i'm in inside another buffer so i can confine my searches, collapsing, and edits to that subtree
[23:32:41] <Demosthenex> i put doc appts in personal
[23:33:36] <Demosthenex> i think the point is i have gross groupings, not fine.
[23:33:57] <asus> So, when you're trying to book your dentist appt, you check your agenda from your "personal" file : Does your agenda show you the entries only from the personal file then ? or did you add all your files (pro, perso, all projects) to the agenda ?
[23:33:58] <Demosthenex> personal.org is a catchall for misc personal items, and a capture target so i can quickly add things
[23:34:04] <Demosthenex> biz.org is the same for business
[23:34:15] <Demosthenex> i have all my common files i want to see in my agenda
[23:34:26] <Demosthenex> if i only want to view personal, i goto that file and open a restricted agenda
[23:34:40] <Demosthenex> just like i can view project file agendas within that file and not add them to my main agenda
[23:34:47] <asus> isn't your agenda overloaded then ??
[23:34:54] <Demosthenex> nope
[23:35:01] <Demosthenex> why would it be?
[23:35:09] <Demosthenex> if i have an appt, it's in the hourly portion
[23:35:19] <Demosthenex> if i have a scheduled item to work on, it shows up in a list
[23:35:28] <asus> let's say you're calling the dentist : He asks you when you are available
[23:35:29] <Demosthenex> if i have too many,i need to do them or consider whether they are worth keeping
[23:35:49] <Demosthenex> C-c a a, scroll thru
[23:35:54] <asus> and in your agenda, you're polluted with biz appts, personal appts, project 1 appts, project 2 appts ??
[23:36:06] <Demosthenex> and? aren't those all on my schedule?
[23:36:12] <asus> Yes
[23:36:19] <Demosthenex> i can't very well visit the dentist while at a work meeting
[23:36:26] <Demosthenex> but i don't schedule every heading.
[23:36:36] <Demosthenex> for instance, a project file almost *never* has scheduled items
[23:36:47] <Demosthenex> i use inactive timestamps to log my time, but i don't schedule or make appts
[23:36:48] <asus> :D this is true, I think I put a magnifying glass on a non-problem ^^
[23:37:05] <Demosthenex> i use C-c / t to collapse to todo items, and i work on those.
[23:37:14] <Demosthenex> inside the project file
[23:37:39] <Demosthenex> if the customer of that project wants a meeting, i may make a heading in my project.org, but i'll put the meeting in my biz.org because it's a biz meeting and the project files aren't in my agenda.
[23:38:09] <Demosthenex> half the time i import .ics files from outlook users, and spam that into a agenda.org that uses a capture template for ics
[23:38:50] <Demosthenex> if i had 4+ scheduled meetings a day, i'd quit
[23:38:59] <Demosthenex> couldn't get anything done if i am just in meetings :P
[23:54:26] <asus> So true ! Demosthenex Thanks for sharing, I may come with more quesitons tho ! :p
[23:55:47] <hmw> Demosthenex: capture template for ics? What does it do ;)?
