[05:00:03] <jargon> No joke.
[05:00:21] <jargon> Same with Java as classified by the CIA.

[23:01:10] <AMcBain> I'm stumped. So work has an Angular app that uses a Bootstrap, but that's kinda irrelevant... the issue is there's extra margin showing up around the "alert" element here: http://paste.asmcbain.net/ff4aa48f/edit afaik <alert /> is not a valid HTML element, but added by the Angular library that makes Angularifies Bootstrap. However if I switch it back to a <div> or remove the margin-left/-right on the alert element, then the strange margin-top/-bottom goes
[23:01:10] <AMcBain> away. The inspector shows some sort of space there (it highlights it) but I can find no reason for it to exist.
[23:03:09] <AMcBain> Weirder still, that magic space appears when hovering the <alert> in the inspector, and appears in addition to the already existing margin-bottom from the internal div with class="alert ..." It shouldn't stack like that.
[23:12:48] <AMcBain> Yeah it doesn't seem to matter what it's called as long as it's not a real element by default. I tried adding it as a custom element (with no additional implementation) and that still results in weird marginy stuff.

[23:28:23] <FunkyBob> AMcBain: collapsing margins?
[23:29:42] <AMcBain> They're supposed to, but for whatever reason they don't here. There's extra margins added on top of the existing ones defined in CSS.
[23:30:37] <AMcBain> Also the background doesn't apply to the element if I apply that class, but it takes the existing mx-3 and applies it strangely, with the top and bottom margins instead, because if I turn off the margin-left/-right manually the top and bottom mystery margins disappear.
[23:30:49] <AMcBain> Something's f'ked but it isn't Bootstrap.
[23:31:30] <FunkyBob> oh... i see what you mean... the margin, according to my inspector, is a small box outside the element entirely
[23:31:46] <FunkyBob> doesn't help it's display: inline

[23:33:07] <AMcBain> This is one where I added background colors and the background color for the "app-alert" doesn't show up at all: http://paste.asmcbain.net/90b33ef8/edit even with me creating it as a custom element.
[23:33:29] <AMcBain> I give up, I don't understand what the mx-2 is supposed to do anyway for us, and I found it in our code so I can remove it and solve the whole thing, but am still confused.

[23:36:53] <AMcBain> It probably should be block based on how it's actually used, but that's the fault of the library we're using, or rather, I think they thought that the elements created by Angular that match the class itself would be transparent (like display-contents type of transparent) except here, they aren't.
