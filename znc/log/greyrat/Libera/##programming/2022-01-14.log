[02:41:58] <sonny> depends on your perspective
[02:42:09] <ProfSimm> Decker: still maybe not it. See, when you look at a 2D illustration of a circle, you see inside the circle, and outside it, you see the entire thing at once. a 4D being looking at you in 3D sees you outside, but from all angles, and it sees you inside, all your organs.

[02:43:08] <Decker> ProfSimm that's not potentially true - if they had a light source that was different from other light

[03:03:23] <ProfSimm> Decker: I think the fact remains 2D UI works best on a screen, as the screen is 2D. But those 2 dimensions can be a projection from arbitrary N-dimensional hyperspace, allowing connections to be more complex than 2D or 3D alone would allow. Like Ted Nelson's Zig Zag structure

[05:24:40] <ProfSimm> Decker: one way in which relativity may be fundamental is electric charge moving in a wire causing a magnetic field.

[05:25:07] <epony> gravity pulls in light.. and time
[05:25:14] <ProfSimm> Decker: so something weird is definitely happening
[05:25:15] <jkk> a cup is relatively smaller than a bigger cup

[05:25:39] <Decker> epony if it did a huge arc of the sky beyond a black hole would be blocked out
[05:26:29] <epony> gravity is so powerful, it brings together dust clouds from vast amounts of space that get close together igniting them into light

[11:35:03] <FloridaMan> Just brought this up in conversation for the first time in a long time
[11:35:07] <FloridaMan> Love that letter

[11:35:43] <mrig> with go asm, this looks like it could be pretty awesome, if there is no cgo involved.
[11:37:15] <FloridaMan> mrig: I'm the same way with JS fwiw, and it's a large part of my job currently heh

[11:37:43] <FloridaMan> I see it as a kind of "necessarily evil" at this point
[11:37:51] <FloridaMan> Necessary*
[11:37:53] *** Joins: o|||||o (~ol_greg@50-24-8-87.chstcmta05.res.dyn.suddenlink.net)
[11:37:53] <mrig> I still suspect it for a bug on my os with the mouse freezing from time to time.
[11:38:12] <biberu> FloridaMan: the runtime perhaps, but having to write it by hand, not really
[11:38:31] <mrig> yes there is one of the design patters that describes it, was quite a revelation to view it from that perspective.
[11:38:37] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[11:39:03] <mrig> I will learn it eventually.
[11:39:29] <FloridaMan> I just feel that overall it has a prevalence that it doesn't really deserve. Totally a matter of opinion, however.
[11:41:07] <deniska> I like JS, it's the closest we've got to BASIC from old times :)
[11:41:13] <FloridaMan> In my view, it sort of "snuck in" at the right time and the stars aligned for it and stayed that way.

[11:42:41] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl)
[11:43:23] <deniska> biberu: I like the language and the fact that every computer ships with a JS interpreter, but I'm not quite fond of how development in JS is done lately
[11:43:29] <mrig> FloridaMan oh yes that's a thought provoking letter!
[11:44:19] *** Joins: frost (~frost@user/frost)
[11:44:22] <FloridaMan> mrig: it really signaled the end of flash, and I'm very happy that it did hehe
[11:44:35] <mrig> I dislike it when JS devs make websites that do not run without js and insult people who have it turned off; But that is more of a cultural issue though I suppose.
[11:45:24] <mrig> FloridaMan yes I bet, puts JS into a different light entirely, when viewed from that angle.
[11:45:32] <deniska> I dislike it when JS devs make websites which feel sluggish
[11:46:05] <deniska> They even have a special term for that, "SPA" :)
[11:46:09] <deniska> sluggish page application
[11:46:16] <FloridaMan> Lol

[11:48:07] <mrig> yes well that is rather a lot of them, it is true that there are some which are absolutely fantastic; If I wasn't forced by the advertising and tracking jerks to block everything, it would probably have a whole other smell or fragrance about it.
[11:49:11] *** Quits: frost (~frost@user/frost) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:49:22] <mrig> bit of quagmire, but again I shouldn't really blame the language and the tec for that.
[11:49:28] *** Quits: gbmor (gbmor@gbmor.org) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[11:49:30] <FloridaMan> JavaScript as a language itself is a little odd. Prototypal languages do exist, but aren't exactly common. And the lack of consensus that used to exist on how to properly handle asynchronous things didn't help either

[11:50:25] <mrig> writing this and can not see my text entry box so sorry for any mistakes.
[11:50:44] <EdFletcher> Also it has a lot of bloat because they never remove anything for backwards compatibility’s sake. “Don’t break the web” is the mantra. 
[11:51:10] <EdFletcher> But as someone in here put it well, “there’s a beautiful language hiding inside JavaScript” 😂👍 
[11:51:19] <FloridaMan> Haha
[11:51:24] <mrig> phew, managed to get rid of it, I hate it when my OS does that to me :(

[11:52:26] <FloridaMan> I mean just the name is even confusing. I guess the syntax sorta kinda somewhat maybe looks like Java, but even classes using the class keyword are relatively new and were just syntactic sugar until recently
[11:53:09] <EdFletcher> I love making cool stuff with just vanilla JS. Both of these an entirely single page no dependencies https://tmt.computerpho.be https://pc.computerpho.be (built the first to build the second)

[11:53:21] <FloridaMan> And let's not even get into Electron
[11:53:25] <EdFletcher> Oh the name was one of the biggest mistakes for sure 
[11:53:59] <EdFletcher> And you can’t blame JS for Electron, it’s just a natural consequence of the language’s popularity. 
[11:54:35] <mrig> EdFletcher: do you think it communicates with the small wonderful language that is said to be inside of C++?
[11:55:07] <deniska> C++ has way too many wonderful language in it
[11:55:10] <deniska> languages*
[11:55:18] *** Joins: frost (~frost@user/frost)
[11:55:31] <mrig> It will be fun to use plain JS once I've nailed down some math chops, sure of that.
[11:55:46] <EdFletcher> mrig: Haha I do indeed! But yeah I like deniska’s addendum here, I’d say both JS and C++ have multiple hidden personality disorder 😜 
[11:55:52] <FloridaMan> Floats are fun in JS also
[11:55:53] <merijn> deniska: And quite a number of horrible ones ;)
[11:56:01] <deniska> merijn: yeah, like C :P

[11:58:01] <mrig> The floats in JS kind of make sense when you see it as a language for dealing with the superficial details as a leaf of a branch of a tree that has been made by another language.
[11:58:18] <mrig> in that context it seems great.
[11:59:30] <rindolf> mrig: prog langs evo is not a tree
[12:00:37] <mrig> rindolf I was describing one of the design patterns not programming language evolution, I forget the name of it off hand.
[12:01:11] <merijn> deniska: pfft, C++ doesn't contain C!

[12:03:33] <merijn> That is true
[12:03:44] <merijn> It contains enough non-C to be dangerous too, though :p
[12:04:00] <mrig> rindolf oh yes that makes sense, fits this pattern, with nodes in a graph being language agnostic, we see where the JS 'Objects' come from.
[12:05:32] <rindolf> mrig: i use class {...} in TS/ES

[12:56:04] <mrig> EdFletcher, great film, seems to be heavily based on a knowledge of indian culture.
[12:56:05] <tomathy> merijn: i thought it stayed the same
[12:56:20] <rindolf> tomathy: i suspect several vampirellas / terminators seduced me "in their mind"
[12:56:37] <mrig> gattaka is a sanskrit word that is really quite fundamental.
[12:56:47] <merijn> tomathy: I mean, your body has a whole bunch of safety mechanisms to prevent/destroy errors

[12:57:26] <mrig> and the marriage checking is very similar to the way that it is done there for arranged marriages.

The worst ones just get destroyed/rendered useless so nothing diverges "too much" (until it does and you suddenly have cancer...)

I have this type of problem: ``Help a robot move along a (linear) track, with spaces numbered 0 through 99, by calculating its new position when given "direction" (a string which will be either forward / backward) and "num_pos", which is a non-negative number of moves in the direction stipulated. The robot cannot move beneath the 0th spot or
[21:25:20] <noob9000> above the 99th spot.``
[21:25:25] <fweht> GeDaMo: yeah, thought so, thanks for the answer :)
[21:26:04] <noob9000> Now, I come from Python, so i thought to just do if-then spam...but that won't work for OCaml's functional paradigm... and it's breaking me
[21:26:10] <GeDaMo> noob9000: max and min might be useful
[21:27:04] <noob9000> hmm, okay, the problem before this one introduced `max` and `min` exactly today, lol..but i cant tell how that would help algorithmically honestly..
[21:27:24] <GeDaMo> pos + num_pos cannot go above 99
[21:28:35] <macaw> noob9000: max is useful in setting a lower bound, min in setting an upper bound.
[21:28:38] <GeDaMo> if pos + num_pos is 89, which do you want 89 or 99?
[21:28:58] <GeDaMo> if pos + num_pos is 105, which do you want 105 or 99
[21:29:00] <GeDaMo> ?
[21:29:36] <noob9000> 99, yeah

[22:55:57] <bjs> node1: yes, imagine you have a state machine for ab and de then to compose these with the c? state machine what you can do is take ab, then have two transitions one to the c state machine (on "c") and one to the de state machine (on any input) and then from the c machine to the de machine (on any input).  That would get you an NFA.
