[00:28:56] <sysRPN> they are selling a 32" QHD LG monitor at costco for $200
[00:29:01] <sysRPN> i was considering buying it
[00:29:21] <sysRPN> MaNa2k: wow, that's terrible
[00:29:28] <MaNa2k> sysRPN, what ?
[00:29:30] <MaNa2k> MAUI ?
[00:29:36] <sysRPN> yes, the 100mb
[00:29:41] <MaNa2k> oh right that lol
[00:29:47] <sysRPN> and it doesn't even work on linux
[00:30:00] <MaNa2k> thats actualy the size ofthe entire project solution folder
[00:30:13] <MaNa2k> the actual size of of the bin\android is around 17mb ithink
[00:30:17] <sysRPN> well, it still doesn't work on linux
[00:30:42] <MaNa2k> sysRPN, you can always emulate the windows version :P
[00:30:50] <sysRPN> i believe ms is counting on "community support" for maui on linux
[00:31:02] *** sysRPN is now known as sysRPL
[00:31:15] * sysRPL changes nick
[00:31:38] <MaNa2k> btw, trying to figure out how navigation actually works. i am able to navigate to new pages and back again, but i seem to loose state, so i tried passing the state of the currentpage to nextpage, then tried to set it back again when going back, but that didnt work

[00:34:17] <Suchiman> at least if it becomes available in germany for not much more expensive than that
[00:34:20] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[00:35:22] <sysRPL> Suchiman: i can't justify spending that much on a monitor
[00:35:38] <sysRPL> i want something bigger for cad. i'm not interested in gaming
[00:36:02] <MaNa2k> Suchiman, shit, are you planning to observe a nasa mission :P
[00:37:59] <Suchiman> sysRPL: yeah it's not cheap but it's the first quantum dot OLED monitor, it has an insanely good coverage of 99.3% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum, up to 175Hz and an okay size (a bit smaller i'd prefer but eh, at least it's not 50" which has been basically all you could get for OLED)
[00:38:03] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Not a fan of alienware
[00:38:05] <Nasp> Looks too gamery
[00:38:14] <Nasp> Although Dell do make nice monitors
[00:38:17] <Suchiman> and ofc perfect blacks
[00:38:17] <Nasp> But not so much Laptops
[00:38:32] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Does it have vesa mounts?
[00:38:42] <sysRPL> Suchiman: are you a graphic design professional?
[00:38:44] <Nasp> Doesn't looks like it
[00:38:47] <Suchiman> Nasp: i think so
[00:38:51] <Suchiman> sysRPL: no
[00:38:58] <Suchiman> sysRPL: but i like fancy colors
[00:38:58] <Suchiman> xD
[00:39:00] <Nasp> Monitor arms are soo onice to have
[00:39:17] <Suchiman> sysRPL: and it's HDR1000 capable
[00:39:47] <Suchiman> supporting NVIDIA G-Sync Ultimate (which allows you to use gsync with HDR which wasn't possible before)
[00:40:15] <Suchiman> and ofc being OLED, it has 0.1ms gray-to-gray response time so no smearing as on LCDs
[00:41:18] <scalablecory> Suchiman: it's definitely a fantastic monitor for coding
[00:41:40] <Suchiman> scalablecory: use AMOLED dark theme in IDE? xD
[00:42:11] <Suchiman> scalablecory: or not being bound by the 80 character columns rule? xD
[00:42:16] <scalablecory> :D
[00:42:26] <scalablecory> i already use an ultrawide for coding
[00:42:33] <scalablecory> it's nice for side by side
[00:43:25] <Suchiman> true dat, especially for git diff view in VS
[00:44:14] <scalablecory> i bet a game like cyberpunk is really pretty with oled

[00:47:14] *** blezz is now known as blez
[00:53:10] <Suchiman> blez: as far as i read the pricing chart, you allocate a fixed amount of memory that the lambda is allowed to use for your function execution and that determines the price, e.g. if you say that your lambda needs 512MB memory to not run out of memory during execution and executes for 3ms then that will cost you 0,0000000249$
[00:55:13] <Suchiman> blez: https://aws.amazon.com/en/lambda/pricing/ they have calculation samples here
[00:56:35] <Suchiman> blez: so basically they price you for the amount of memory used per ms of execution + the number of requests fired

[01:28:02] <blez> I see everything in the calculators except the data transfer charges
[01:30:00] <Suchiman> blez: if you go to https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator then you have lambda for once and "AWS Data Transfer" second to compute everything i think, in data transfer you only input outgoing traffic, incomming traffic is free

[12:57:47] <canton7> MatthiasVance, get the EdgeRouter if you can -- they're kinda being phased out, but they're super-powerful
[12:58:03] <MatthiasVance> ap5: Which Amplifi do you have?
[12:58:12] <canton7> (although it doesn't tie into the rest of the Ubiquity UI stuff, if you care about that)
[12:58:32] <canton7> I've been... mainly impressed with the ubiquity APs. There have been some niggles - it's not all smooth sailing
[12:58:49] <MatthiasVance> canton7: Ah thanks for the recommendation
[12:58:58] <MatthiasVance> I wasn't planning on spending several hundred on a new network setup though :(
[12:59:09] <MatthiasVance> I want to, but doing a massive renovation xD
[12:59:18] <ap5> MatthiasVance, the Amplifi HD - with an extra mesh point
[12:59:30] <canton7> I've got 3 UAP AC Lites FWIW. You can daisy-chain them a bit, which works fairly well

[12:59:48] <ap5> canton7, it doesnt fit into the unifi world

[13:00:07] <canton7> The EdgeRouter? I know, but I care more about how lovely it is to use :P
[13:00:08] <ap5> This is a consumer faced router, built for persons like me with no money :D
[13:00:19] <ap5> MatthiasVance, i needed to get to my 1st floor
[13:00:20] <MatthiasVance> I think I'd rather wire the APs together for extra power
[13:00:47] <MatthiasVance> As in, place a separate wireless AP on the first floor like I have now but wire that AP itself
[13:01:00] <ap5> My router entry is placed in the opposite room down under, so the wifi actaully needs to travel quite a lot to get to my office on first floor
[13:01:21] <ap5> If you had the money, all my would be wired
[13:01:38] <ap5> But it takes ... it is a larger job in my house :D
[13:02:45] <canton7> Note that you don't need the mesh stuff to chain a single UAP to another one wirelessly
[13:03:05] <canton7> (but you can only do 1 hop -- you need the mesh ones to do 2 hops)

[16:56:07] <Suchiman> Nasp: yes
[16:56:14] <Nasp> For what
[16:56:40] <Suchiman> Nasp: like if you have [SomeAuthorization] at the controller but for a specific method you need something else so you go [OverrideAuthorization, CustomAuthorization]
[16:57:05] <Nasp> What does Override and Custom do in this case?
[16:57:14] <Nasp> Just so SomeAuth isn't triggered`?
[16:57:34] <Suchiman> Nasp: OverrideAuthorization ignores previously specified Authorization attributes and CustomAuthorization will be the sole authorization check here
[16:57:37] <Nasp> Override supports the auth being overwritten be CustomAuth?
[16:57:48] <Nasp> Ok, but what would such a usecase actually be?
[16:58:04] <Nasp> Like the user doens't need to be logged in, or the user requires something specific for auth?
[16:58:10] <Suchiman> Nasp: in my case, everything is bearer auth by default except for a few methods which use an ApiKey
[16:58:33] <Nasp> Can't you use a policy instead?
[16:59:09] <Suchiman> Nasp: Policies will AND together and if you come around with an ApiKey, the default Authorization policy that wants a bearer token will say no
[16:59:11] <Nasp> Or requirements, i like those
[16:59:26] <Nasp> That's why i prefer requirements
[16:59:33] <Nasp> I can make a requirement that bypasses another requirement
[16:59:40] <Nasp> Or handler rather
[17:00:11] <Suchiman> Nasp: how so
[17:00:33] <Nasp> Well i have requirements for specific actions to do something similar
[17:00:56] <Nasp> And when where i need to override it i have an override attribute, that just provides the first requirement that says "it's okay anyways"

[17:01:29] <Nasp> Like we have an access check, it checks if the user belongs to the data they try to access
[17:01:39] <Nasp> Then we have some users that have given permissions to our supports to access their data
[17:01:50] <Nasp> Then i can have a separate handler that checks for that
[17:01:57] <Nasp> Suchiman: I find them really nice
[17:02:47] <Suchiman> Nasp: the new policy system is quite nice but it feels... less flexible than the old one for complex things
[17:02:49] <Nasp> If i couild then also get what requirements failed that would be epic, i think that got added in .NET 6, since that would make debugging so much easier when someone gets unauthorized
[17:03:04] <Nasp> Not sure i understand the policy part since it requires so many policies
[17:03:17] <Nasp> But requirements which is jsut added to a policy makes more sense to me
[17:03:34] <cloaker> I recently heard this podcast. `OpenDotNet with Geoffrey Huntley`. Recommended https://pca.st/438mhbim
[17:03:58] <cloaker> Talks about the sorry state of dotnet opensource with microsoft control
[17:04:31] <Nasp> What's the key points?
[17:04:50] <cloaker> I didn't know the dotnet debugger is not open source. People have to invent their own debuggers to support dotnet ide (jetbrains / linqpad ...)
[17:05:15] <Suchiman> oh yeah that thing...
[17:06:01] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: Why do you use attributes for that?
[17:06:04] <Nasp> Not exactly a deal breaker imo
[17:06:17] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Anyways those requirements are also handle for like warmup and tests
[17:06:20] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: why not? (this is Web API 2 i'm currently migrating to ASP.NET Core)
[17:06:24] <Nasp> So you can make a handler that just passes all requirements :D
[17:06:37] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I redid everything to requirements when moving it
[17:06:47] <Suchiman> Nasp: well, yeah, you have to :P
[17:06:58] <Suchiman> because the AuthorizeAttribute has no more logic inside that you could override
[17:07:08] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: To make it simpler
[17:07:24] <MatthiasVance> And easier to mix/match
[17:07:26] <Nasp> Suchiman: Although i ran into a bit of an issue where a specific requirement requires a specific statuscode when it fails
[17:07:27] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: i mean, how would you do it in Web API 2 without using attributes :P ?
[17:07:33] <MatthiasVance> Ohh
[17:07:42] <Nasp> But i think i found an idea for that, but i was told to just let it be for now
[17:07:56] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: I think you can do that with a filter?

[17:33:51] <Nasp> What
[17:33:59] <Nasp> Why not move that into the handler then
[17:34:45] <Nasp> We have finally written to our integration partnjers are are killing API keys and our authserver
[17:34:50] <Nasp> To give them a good jumpscare
[17:34:54] <Nasp> Gave them 6 months i think
[17:35:07] <Suchiman> Nasp: xD
[17:35:20] <Nasp> That's one of those few things we can't convert to Core
[17:35:25] <Nasp> And then a single service used for the IRS
[17:35:37] <Nasp> Which requires an old encryption scheme nobody bothered to port to core
[17:35:47] <Nasp> Probably because it shouldn't be used
[17:36:18] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah yeah, our delphi app uses rijndael  96 bit with a non standard key schedule
[17:37:02] <Nasp> TripleDesRsa15 if that rings a bell
[17:37:12] <Suchiman> ah TripleDes lol
[17:37:40] <Nasp> We've talked with them and they dont have tim
[17:37:45] <Suchiman> Nasp: but yeah i'm pulling your leg here a little, i have mostly already switched to policies, just this one attribute i need to get going proper
[17:37:46] <Nasp> Also nobody wanted to use their API, i wonder why
[17:38:08] <Nasp> Also i've asked if they at least just up the security algoriuthm to something newer
[17:38:12] <Nasp> That should'nt be that hard... right?
[17:38:29] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Cobol doesn't just support new algos
[17:39:25] <Nasp> I also considered if i could just port the old algo
[17:39:33] <Nasp> OR if newer actualyl works, we haven't really tested it
[17:39:44] <Nasp> No idea how to actually test if the IRS API works locally
[17:40:05] <Nasp> TripleDES just sounds sooo bad
[17:41:22] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  It's actually not COBOL but Java
[17:41:32] <Nasp> But there's probably COBOL in there somewhere
[17:42:10] <MatthiasVance> or FoxPro
[17:42:11] <MatthiasVance> :D
[17:42:16] <MatthiasVance> But not in the case of Java probably
[17:42:43] <Nasp> Worst part is people have asked for this API for years
[17:42:48] <Nasp> Then turns out they have it and nobody used it
[17:42:54] <Nasp> They are just wasting so many man hours
[17:43:00] <Nasp> Also responses takes like 1-2 minutes :D
[17:43:33] <MatthiasVance> Why are people asking for APIs that already exist? Or aren't they exposed to the outside world?
[17:44:44] <MatthiasVance> I wonder if there's a source with all kinds of weird JSON files
[17:45:48] <Nasp> They are quite complex to use
[17:45:54] <Nasp> Requires certs and soap
[17:45:58] <Nasp> So probably why nobody wants to use them
[17:46:08] <Nasp> Also seemed like the IRS didn't knew they had it themselves
[17:55:11] <MatthiasVance> ahh

[18:12:03] <irwiss> Nasp: could just run reverse proxy that deals with the crypto
[18:12:24] <Nasp> irwiss:  Yeah but do you know how to make a reverse proxy that translate soap correctly?
[18:12:55] <irwiss> i mean, have the proxy only handle crypto, handle soap in the core app
[18:12:57] <Nasp> Also that kinda is how we use it, we have an API jsut for that
[18:13:00] <Nasp> But it's still a pain
[18:13:11] <Nasp> Yeah but that sounds like just as much a pain tbh
[18:13:26] <irwiss> hm it's just nginx instance with basic config
[18:13:41] <Nasp> And the signing of the soap?
[18:13:48] <Nasp> And do you think nginx supports tripledes?
[18:14:00] <bomb> haproxy gets the girlz
[18:14:53] <Nasp> I think we should just write to all our customers that we can no longer support it due to it being insecure and that the IRS are lazy bums, and then make them all call the IRS and piss them of :D
[18:14:55] <Nasp> That would be fun

[18:18:38] <Nasp> Yes we are, but danish gov has a bit of a different opinion about EU rules
[18:19:15] <irwiss> Nasp: pretty sure nginx just uses whatever crypto lib you link it with, but most likely it supports it on the remote side
[18:19:24] <Suchiman> Nasp: did they pass GDPR as a law and then just proceeded to nevermind enforcing it?
[18:19:56] <irwiss> worst case you run slightly older nginx, but as long as the only entry point is just your api thingy it should be safe... or at least as safe as using 3des

[18:22:37] <Suchiman> over here literally everyone had a meltdown when GDPR happened lol
[18:22:52] <Nasp> We looked at it for a week and then ignore it
[18:22:55] <irwiss> Nasp: no i mean, nginx comes with a crypto lib by default cause it has to support tls on upstream... the only issue might be if the shipped crypto lib cut out 3des for security... but usually they just disable bad/outdated crypto on proxy side, not the upstream
[18:23:25] *** Joins: Xenoprimate_Surf (Xenoprimat@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/xenoprimate)
[18:24:13] <irwiss> so you could run your api <-> nginx <-> your 3des server, so your api sees some modern-ish crypto and nginx just tunnels the traffic and either removes the shitty crypto or replaces it with modern one

[18:24:21] <Nasp> Danish gov just shrugs

[20:10:20] <canton7> smitty, how are you getting the status?
[20:10:40] <smitty> this class is a wrapper around `Task`, it's returning Task.Status
[20:11:20] <smitty> it's also buggy, I've been trying to nail down a race condition within it
[20:11:28] <canton7> Are you using `await` within it or something?

[20:13:10] <smitty> I inherited this codebase about 2 months ago so i'm not 100% sure of some of the design decisions made
[20:14:23] <smitty> this is also targeting .net 4.0
[20:14:37] <jonp> why?!
[20:14:48] <smitty> Windows XP support was originally part of the requirement
[20:14:54] <jonp> still?
[20:15:05] <canton7> smitty, well, line 105 re-assigns Operation?
[20:15:05] <smitty> luckily it got dropped about 3 weeks ago
[20:15:12] <Ownix> Suchiman: yeah I am using .net core, I whipped that up in LinqPad
[20:15:23] <canton7> I'm assuming that Run is called repeatedly somewhere?
[20:15:44] <jonp> this class isn't thread-safe, i don't know what TaskEx.Run() does, and i find that class scary
[20:15:54] <canton7> If you call Run and the Operation task has completed, then it starts again, it seems. That would certainly explain the Status going backwards
[20:15:55] <smitty> you are right to be scared
[20:15:57] <Suchiman> Ownix: then you can use StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries
[20:16:23] <canton7> jonp, IIRC it's just Task.Run, but provided by the nuget package which ports async stuff back to older framework versions which don't support it natively
[20:16:40] <smitty> I want to rip this out and replace it with Quartz or something but I also don't want to retarget the .net framework version as we're supposed to go live next week and we've been moving incredibly quickly and I didn't want to add to the chaos
[20:16:43] <jonp> that's what it *could* be, but *is* it?
[20:17:15] <Ownix> Suchiman: whaaaat that is awesome!

[20:26:46] <smitty> canton7: I was suspcious of multiple `run` calls as well and there's only 2 references to it, but I'm adding a bunch of logging around that assignment to see if it is indeed being overwritten

[21:14:30] <canton7> I did not! Huh, thanks for the heads-up!
[21:15:25] <canton7> I'll see whether it's a bad or a good mention this evening :P
[21:15:59] <Suchiman> Nasp: hmm 3s for ASP.NET Core to startup, 23s for EF6 to initialize xD

[21:32:07] <Suchiman> Nasp: in release config it's 0-1s for asp.net, 9s for ef6, the debugger adds quite a bit of overhead, can't see a difference with R2R though

[21:35:32] <Nasp> Ahh
[21:35:39] <Nasp> Ours i 20-25 i think
[21:35:55] <Nasp> I actually looked into generating the edmx build, but never really got around to it
[21:35:58] <Nasp> Not sure if it actually helped

[21:36:14] <Nasp> But it just sounds like we lot considering we have 30 DbContexts
[21:37:30] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[21:37:35] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah, well, i just have one context with like 220 DbSet's
[21:37:47] <Nasp> AHh so yeah sounds around the sam,e :D
[21:37:53] <Nasp> Do you have anything to warmup the DbContext / DbSets?
[21:37:59] <Suchiman> no
[21:38:06] <Suchiman> first access first suffer
[21:38:31] <Nasp> We make a request to all DbSet before switching into the load balancer pool
[21:39:41] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah, yeah, i use the application warmup feature to retrieve the first item from the database and the app service loadbalancer only switches in once that warmup request completed with a success status code
[21:41:30] <Suchiman> Nasp: yada yada    <applicationInitialization>      <add initializationPage="/Home/AppInitialize" />    </applicationInitialization>  </system.webServer>
[21:41:42] <Nasp> yeah i know of it, we removed it and made our own
[21:41:44] <Suchiman> ... gotta have to check how that works with core
[21:41:50] <Nasp> It does
[21:42:19] <Nasp> I wonder how much a startup impact EFCore would have on the same amount of DbSet
[21:42:26] <Nasp> And if it generates them all on any requests
[21:44:05] <MatthiasVance> So apparently distributed timers are fun
[21:44:07] <MatthiasVance> Not
[21:45:56] <Nasp> Hmm what up
[21:49:54] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: So I need to have a list of schedules and make sure tasks get executed at a certain time
[21:50:01] <MatthiasVance> Task executors need to be scaled horizontally
[21:50:20] <Nasp> I use hangfire for that
[21:51:22] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: How does the scaling work?
[21:51:51] <Nasp> Well it throws a message on a bus and then hits whatever instance first gets it
[21:52:22] <MatthiasVance> Oh hm that's nice
[21:53:04] <MatthiasVance> Is it possible to scale the controller itself too?
[21:55:43] <MatthiasVance> As in that will be the bottleneck of the platform :D
[21:55:57] <Nasp> yeah sure
[21:56:03] <Nasp> But the controller doesn't really do much
[21:56:07] <Nasp> It just publishes to queues
[21:59:12] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yeah, I have lots and LOTS of tasks going through at once
[21:59:16] <MatthiasVance> So that is a concern :D
[21:59:46] <MatthiasVance> They need to run within 5 seconds of their scheduled time
[21:59:56] <Nasp> How long do they usually take?
[22:00:54] <MatthiasVance> That depends on how much data there is to process, but usually 10 - 60 seconds I think.. which is why the task executors are already scaled
[22:01:02] <MatthiasVance> I just need something to fill up a queue or something :D
[22:02:05] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: sounds like something that azure functions with a cron trigger would do well
[22:02:20] <MatthiasVance> The schedules are not known at compile time though
[22:02:47] <Nasp> Sounds like a good job for hangfire
[22:02:52] <Nasp> Although that was Russian right Suchiman ?
[22:02:59] <Nasp> Also it's the best of the worst
[22:03:03] <MatthiasVance> lol
[22:03:04] <Nasp> Or how it is you say it
[22:03:07] <Nasp> It's not really awesome
[22:03:11] <Nasp> But it's the best out there i think
[22:03:20] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: What are the downsides / traps?
[22:03:45] <MatthiasVance> Ah, controller is scalable -> "It is possible to run multiple server instances inside a process, machine, or on several machines at the same time. Each server use distributed locks to perform the coordination logic."
[22:03:59] *** Quits: dinowilliam (~dinowilli@138.204.26.120) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:04:56] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah... hm xD first he changed his github location from moskow to Thailand, and now he has no more location on his profile xD
[22:05:55] <DevJohnC> the hangfire homepage does say they're russian and the war is wrong
[22:05:57] <DevJohnC> so kudos to them
[22:06:34] <Suchiman> ah, cool https://www.hangfire.io/
[22:07:29] * Suchiman looks at recent commits https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/commits/master
[22:07:35] <Suchiman> lol, well, certainly stirred some chaos
[22:08:54] <MatthiasVance> I see that as "I want to make sure the software can be used regardless"
[22:09:18] <MatthiasVance> Except the return to LGPL xD
[22:09:47] <DevJohnC> LGPL isn't bad, really
[22:11:50] <MatthiasVance> Oh no I just meant that the commit before that was more a "use it however you see fit"

[22:24:59] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Not sure if there's downsides
[22:25:09] <Nasp> but the way we've done it is we throw all schedules on a queue
[22:25:31] <Nasp> So when it's the schedule time to trigger a message is published, so the controller itself just does publish to RabbitMq, then workers does the rest
[22:25:38] <Nasp> So it's just a matter of how well you scale your workers
[22:25:56] <Nasp> Suchiman: So did you warmup or not before switching?
[22:26:14] <Suchiman> Nasp: i did warmup before switching
[22:26:18] <Nasp> ahh ok
[22:26:21] <Nasp> Just sounded like you didn't
[22:26:37] <Suchiman> Nasp: i don't warmup on my local machine (TM) xD
[22:26:39] <Suchiman> https://youtu.be/bXzTXD_OJo0
[22:26:43] <Nasp> Also core needs way less warmup
[22:26:53] <Nasp> It's just enugh to hit a single controller i think to warm them all up
[22:26:56] <Nasp> But you need to hit it 3 times
[22:27:50] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Ah yeah, I wonder if at some point publishing the messages will be slower than 5 seconds with 100.000 tasks at the same time
[22:27:58] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: But I could test that of course
[22:28:11] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I made a hosted service that makes a HTTP request to itself for Core
[22:28:34] <Nasp> Publishing a message takes a few ms
[22:28:36] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Are you using Hangfire with a cloud DB?
[22:28:41] <Nasp> Do you have 100.000 tasks at the same time
[22:28:44] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[22:28:45] <Nasp> It's backed by postgres
[22:28:52] <Nasp> *How do you run that now?
[22:29:12] <MatthiasVance> I run part of that by using GCP Scheduler
[22:29:19] <MatthiasVance> But that would be just one customer with 500 tasks
[22:29:22] <Nasp> So 100k schedules?
[22:29:24] <MatthiasVance> That run every 10 minutes
[22:29:33] <MatthiasVance> No one customer would be up to 500
[22:29:34] <Nasp> I've not tested it that high, i don't think it's fast enough for that
[22:30:44] *** Joins: greeb (~greeb@blahblahblah.anime.horse)
[22:32:51] <MatthiasVance> Yeah this is the bottleneck of the solution :P I might just write a simple thing and then go from there
[22:32:58] <MatthiasVance> Measure outputs etc
[22:33:32] <Nasp> But sounds like you need some queues to just have a bunch of instances running to do the tasks
[22:33:34] <MatthiasVance> Also testing things with GCP with the gcloud console seems pretty easy compared to Azure
[22:33:42] <Nasp> But yeah not sure it can publish 100.000 tasks a second
[22:33:54] <MatthiasVance> Yeah the queues + consumers part is pretty standard I'd say :D
