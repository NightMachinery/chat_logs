[00:19:35] <dale> https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/tree/master/patches probably has some of the most significant changes from stock Emacs.  Apparently the "emacs" recipe just builds TTY Emacs only.  The "emacs" Homebrew Cask is a binary build of Emacs, the one from emacsformacosx.com.
[00:19:49] <johnjay> ah ok yes i read one was the mitsuharu port

[00:21:26] <dale> johnjay: MacPorts: emacs and emacs-devel are stock Emacs at different versions, emacs-devel is a development/pre-release i.e. built from Git HEAD or something.  I suspect these are either TTY only or, more likely, built to install Emacs files to "normal" MacPorts locations like /opt/local/usr/share/emacs/lisp and such.  Contrast with emacs-app and emacs-app-devel, which are most likely analogous to
[00:21:28] <dale> emacs and emacs-app except that they build a full "app bundle", which just means that all of the application is within a directory called Emacs.app, including the Elisp, etc.  emacs-mac-app is the Mitsuharu unofficial port.

[05:00:40] <rdrg109_> Has anyone of you managed to send a sexp from the *scratch* buffer to ielm?
[05:01:05] <rdrg109_> Is there any default keybinding for accomplishing that?
[05:01:43] <bpalmer> C-k and then C-y in ielm

[06:14:39] <Thaodan> johnjay: Precompile every package that is bundled instead of doing it when you use it. Save CPU time but costs more diskspace 
[06:14:57] <Thaodan> b3: NIH and meh GPLv3 
[06:15:20] <bremner> so, same as emacs?
[06:15:25] <Thaodan> in theory you just need libgcc and libgccjit

[06:16:20] <williewillus> what? openbsd is on clang on all the prominent archs, only older/obscure ones are stuck with gcc 4
[06:16:38] <johnjay> i havent' ever native compiled elisp before
[06:16:49] <williewillus> i think ports can also be built with gcc 8, it's just the one in the base system that's old

[06:33:22] <edrx> at that time R$1 was worth very close to US$1
[06:34:08] <bpalmer> aha. Nowadays it's worth about 1/5 , it seems
[06:34:16] <edrx> yep
[06:34:22] <bpalmer> but is somebody a "millionaire" with 1 million real?
[06:35:10] <bpalmer> (of course, in the US, people talk about "millionaires" but it seems very evident that they're not actually pricing things as to what a million dollars would buy)

[07:06:35] <Spawns_Carpeting> do emacsclient instances reload the entire init each time they start?
[07:07:08] <Spawns_Carpeting> I am wondering if things are going to be double ran and if I should put guards around the config to make sure we are or arent in server mode
[07:07:26] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: they do not load the init at all
[07:07:38] <Thaodan> just call emacs to spawn a window
[07:08:05] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: they connect to an existing emacs, which likely ran the init on its own (unless started with -q or -Q )

[10:02:00] <abhijit> I will think this in detail but I disagree as of now. lisp is a tool. Emacs is a product - result of using that tool (which in turn again is a tool to accomplish something else)

[13:09:36] <greyrat> the script gets JSON for each comment, then gets the comment's children IDs from this JSON, and then gets them, too. The process shells out the HTML from the JSON responses. So when it hangs on the shelling out part, the JSON of the previous responses are fine, and converted succesfully as well. Repeating the shelling out part on the current HTML response manually (via the shell) also works fine.

[16:34:00] <JibStyle> I still can't figure out why certain TLS connections fail the certificate check (eg stackoverflow.com). I just updated my Cygwin package containing root certificates. `curl` and `gnutls-cli` work fine. EWW in Emacs fails -- it says certificate expired. Scratching my head...

[16:41:38] <whatacold>   Hi, I want to share with you a Magit video that I made in the past
[16:41:39] <whatacold>   three days about how to discard/revert commits:
[16:41:39] <whatacold>   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D4cV0aodGw .
[16:41:40] <whatacold>   If you're not very familiar with Git, or you are curious about
[16:41:40] <whatacold>   Magit, then this video may help you.
[16:41:41] <whatacold>   It is my first video. I knew that I didn't speak English fluently while
[16:41:41] <whatacold>   I was screencasting, and I said in a low volume of voice, but I've
[16:41:42] <whatacold>   spent a lot of time in video editing to improve it, and I also made
[16:41:42] <whatacold>   a subtitle manually to make sure that I make it clear.
[16:41:43] <whatacold>   Anyway, leave a comment if you have any question or suggestions, thank!

[16:48:05] <JibStyle> sg2002: Thanks, I'll look into that. I'm trying to learn how to diagnose this problem.
[16:48:19] <sg2002> JibStyle: Non cygwin 27.2 eww https://stackoverflow.com/ works fine for me, so it's possibly Cygwin related. Sadly I don't have a cygwin 27.2 on hand, need to build it.
[16:49:15] <sg2002> JibStyle: Set gnutls-log-level to let's say 2 and see if something useful pops up.
[16:50:20] <JibStyle> Yeah, that's one bit I'm trying to figure out as well (if the problem is with Cygwin or Emacs). Strangely as I said above, curl and gnutls-cli run in Cygwin terminal work fine.
[16:50:32] <sg2002> JibStyle: How did you get the Cygwin Emacs by the way? Is it the one that's bundled with Cygwin?
[16:50:36] <JibStyle> Ok, will try `gnutls-log-level'
[16:50:55] <JibStyle> Yes, I found the `emacs-w32' package in Cygwin setup.exe package manager.

[16:52:01] <sg2002> JibStyle: Nothing particularly strange about it, let's say that uh, gnutls Emacs implementation is not very well maintained due to lack of manpower.
[16:53:28] <JibStyle> Fair enough, just trying to fix it so I can run EWW and Gnus.

[22:45:34] <sg2002> There's one idea I keep forgetting to try and implement - I use smartparens and it inserting pairs is more annoying than useful for me more more often than not. So what I want is the pair only inserted when there's a space after the point. Anyone knows if any package already implements this?

[23:03:22] <sg2002> krux02: Flycheck has been working well out of box for me for ages. But recently I've tried flymake again and it seems to be working decently enough. It has kind of a different UI now too, so you might as well try alternating both. That's my take for now.
[23:03:52] <krux02> I often just use `compile`

[23:20:06] <sg2002> skangas: Originally flymake had some weird bugs in quite a few use cases and flycheck had a much cleaner design, that's why plenty of people started using it. Now that flymake got better, I'm struggling to see any practical difference.

Presumably Flymake could be configured for any of them, but Flycheck just configures them out of the box.  I guess a caveat is that it has been a year or two since I looked (post-Flymake-improvement but still a while back).
