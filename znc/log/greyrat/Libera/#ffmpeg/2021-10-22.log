[01:05:40] <aphysically> wew linktime surprisingly long for ffmpeg --enable-lto; I'd guess it doesn't make much of a difference anyway since stuff is mostly optimized
[01:06:27] <aphysically> is it -flto=1 maybe?
[01:07:12] <hyrcanus> don't remember if i enabled lto
[01:08:43] <furq> didn't make much difference last time i tried it

[01:22:39] <DeHackEd> you need -flto at link time as well to be effective. and it would assume a static link

[01:24:53] *** Joins: pong (~beaver@user/pong)
[01:29:03] <furq> you can just --enable-lto in configure now
[01:29:06] <kepstin> with lto, most of the compilation is delayed to link time, and the linker runs the compiler itself, via a plugin (or in the case of lld with llvm/clang, in the linker itself)
[01:29:22] <furq> no need to mess around with ldflags or anything
[01:29:35] <sfan5> furq: that uses unthreaded lto though which will take a loooong time
[01:29:36] <kepstin> and yeah, i'd expect somewhat limited benefit in ffmpeg, since a lot of the important stuff is already optimized assembly, or external libraries :/
[01:29:46] <furq> i benchmarked it with ffmpeg and x264 a while back and got maybe a two or three percent bump
[01:29:52] <furq> which i guess is nice but not really worth the time it took
[01:34:04] <aphysically> sfan5: yeah it did, I guess it's hardcoded to be single threaded for some reason
[01:34:25] <aphysically> since iirc gcc changed the default for just "-flto" to be multithreaded by default

[06:33:20] <prologic> Is there a good way using ffmpeg go generate a video poster (single frame/image as a PNG) that's guaranteed to both have a non-blank image and actually succeed?
[06:34:26] <prologic> Right now I'm using something like this:
[06:34:26] <prologic> ffmpeg -ss 00:00:03.000 -i video.mp4 -y -vframes 1 -strict -loglevel quiet poster.png
[06:34:35] <prologic> But I _believe_ for a <3s video it silently fails
[06:34:56] <prologic> This also doesn't guarantee a non-blank image either
[06:35:12] <prologic> I know ffmpeg has filters for this, but I can't find the right filter and bit of config options to do what I want here :D

[06:41:24] <tar_xvf> prologic: i think you may be thinking of the tpad video filter https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#toc-tpad
[06:41:48] <prologic> tpad eh? hmmm
[06:41:49] <prologic> Lemme see
[06:41:52] <tar_xvf> try "-vf tpad=stop=-1" to indefinitely pad the final frame of the video
[06:41:58] <prologic> Don't ask me why finding this out is fo f'n hard :D
[06:42:04] <prologic> I find SO to be so useless these days
[06:42:10] <prologic> Full of rubbish Q's and A's and noise :/
[06:42:11] <kepstin> er, that doesn't seem related, other than that it could be used to work around a too-short video, possibly.
[06:42:17] <tar_xvf> incase your start seek input flag is beyond the length of the video
[06:42:48] <kepstin> ffmpeg does have a filter called 'thumbnail' which is intended to pick an "interesting" frame out of a sequence of frames.
[06:42:48] <prologic> Yeah I need something that doesn't have to seek if I can
[06:42:53] <kepstin> but it's tricky to use
[06:42:55] <prologic> I can't guarantee the length of a video in the first place
[06:43:02] <prologic> Only an upper bound on uploaded size
[06:43:50] <prologic> Tricky to use how? Like tricky to read the docs and get the right incarnation of options?
[06:44:12] <AMM> You can't guarantee a non-blank video so there's no guarantee for any invocation to produce a non-blank thumbnail
[06:44:16] <kepstin> no - it's very straightforwards design, but it's not obvious how to get good results from it.
[06:44:19] <tar_xvf> I should try the thumbnail filter sometime
[06:44:49] <kepstin> you need to pick some number of possible frames from the video for the thumbnail filter to look at, then the filter picks one of the frames.
[06:45:09] <kepstin> so you first have to pick a section of the video where there might be something interesting
[06:45:37] <kepstin> and thumbnail filter can't just look over the entire video, because it ends up buffering every frame it looks at in ram
[06:45:55] <AMM> I'd ffprobe, try to get thumbnail from first N seconds, judge whether it's blank and retry a bit later, and just use whatever that gives
[06:46:21] <AMM> ffprobe to get a so-so duration to decide whether there's any point in continuing in the first place
[06:51:36] <prologic> Hmm
[06:52:01] <prologic> I don't think I'm that worried about some user submitting a 0s video or a 10s video f just blank or empt ynonthing
[06:52:16] <prologic> But I need to not hard-code a 3s seek obviously
[06:52:36] <AMM> Then don't?
[06:52:43] <prologic> I'll check out this thumbnail filter and see if I can figure out (I've seen this before) how to produce 3 frames to look at
[06:52:55] <AMM> -vf thumbnail -t 3 or something to pick a frame from the first few seconds
[06:53:15] <prologic> Oh that might work actually
[06:53:17] <AMM> If you're worried of an attack on ram, downscale the video before the thumbnail filter
[06:53:22] <prologic> It won't matter if the video is <3s right?
[06:53:28] <AMM> Nope
[06:53:38] <prologic> Yeah I do downscale it beforehand
[06:53:44] <AMM> Maybe also limit fps unless thumbnail filter handles that
[06:53:47] <prologic> I also limited what you can upload in size too
[06:53:54] <prologic> *nods*
[06:53:59] <AMM> So you don't get 3000 frames in memory when someone ups a 1k fps file
[06:54:18] <prologic> Is that even possible at say an upper bound of 20MB?
[06:54:26] <prologic> Could you even get 3000 frames in that size? :D
[06:54:38] <AMM> Easily
[06:54:47] <prologic> Damn fuck okay :)
[06:54:47] <AMM> I've done entire movies in under 10MiB
[06:54:55] <prologic> gez
[06:55:05] <prologic> I'd better test this attack vector then
[06:55:14] <prologic> At worst it just OOMs the backend
[06:55:16] <prologic> So *meh*
[06:55:39] <AMM> Yeah, it's not super bad but multimedia is hell, enemies everywhere
[06:56:00] <AMM> Webms that resize themselves, broken bitstreams for crashing browsers, whatnot
[06:56:05] <kepstin> the mastodon software has an upload limit big enough that folks have uploaded the entire hackers movie in almost watchable quality :)
[06:56:13] <AMM> https://mygi.ga/Nd3/aegUB.webm
[06:56:34] <prologic> I had to give up on WebM/WebP honestly
[06:56:43] <prologic> The support for it is just utter rubbish and quite bad across so many paltforms
[06:56:44] <kepstin> huh, firefox deals surprisingly well with that
[06:58:12] <prologic> That worked like a charm
[06:58:17] <prologic> I'll test it with some other video inputs
[06:58:25] <prologic> But -vf thumbnail -t 3 works nicely
[06:58:43] <prologic> Dunno why I was using this silly seek mode before
[06:59:10] <kepstin> that could possibly generate multiple frames in some videos
[06:59:21] <kepstin> i recommend using the "-frames 1" output option rather than -t 3 :)
[07:01:11] <AMM> oh right yeah, -t is output
[07:01:49] <AMM> There's an option for limiting reads too iirc, if thumbnail filter doesn't have durations
[07:02:14] <kepstin>  thumbnail filter outputs a fixed number of output frames per number of input frames
[07:02:19] <kepstin> so it should be ok
[07:02:32] <kepstin> default is 1 output frame per 100 input frames
[07:03:06] <kepstin> (which would be a little over 3s in a 30fps video, for example, but less time for higher framerate and vice-versa)

[11:00:41] <elenril> aphysically:???
[11:02:04] <aphysically> ? I assumed it's being patched out?
[11:03:05] <elenril> "it"?
[11:03:25] <aphysically> one of your commits accidentally didn't deprecate a bunch of fields in ffprobe when removing what powered them, so all the related fields in ffprobe are still there and still display output, but they're just fake wrong values
[11:03:31] <aphysically> sorry I thought you had gotten the message about this
[11:03:50] <aphysically> so I assumed those ffprobe fields are getting removed in some later patch
[11:03:57] <elenril> not really
[11:04:07] <elenril> I am aware for closed captions breakage, but that's all
[11:04:11] <elenril> s/for/of/
[11:04:20] <aphysically> oh there's also coded_width and coded_height
[11:04:29] <aphysically> and uhhh film-grain I think is broken too
[11:04:55] <elenril> how can film grain be related to any deprecations when it was just added a few months ago
[11:04:57] <aphysically> closed captions and film-grain I think still do something when you probe the actual data, but coded_width and coded_height just display fake wrong values now and there's no way to fix it
[11:05:58] <aphysically> I made a trac bug: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9456
[11:06:42] <aphysically> coded_width and coded_height deprecation needs backported to 4.4 so we're not reporting wrong values anymore
[11:07:51] <elenril> okay, I will look into it once I'm back from vacation
