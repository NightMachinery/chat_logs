[11:03:57] <FromGitter> <mg-yetti> Hi all! I am a spacemacs noob. I'd like to use the `org-roam` so I added the `org` layer to the `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`. Then in the `dotspacemacs/user-config` I try to set the org-roam directory like so: `(setq org-roam-directory "/path/to/org-roam")`. However, that does not seem to work and at the startup I get the error message "No such file or directory $HOME/org-roam"... How or where should I set 
[11:03:57] <FromGitter> ... the variable?
[11:21:04] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @mg-yetti  replace $HOME by ~
[11:21:08] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> this is not shell script
[11:26:11] <FromGitter> <mg-yetti> @lebensterben  sorry I know, it's not really what is says in the error msg. It looks for the org-roam directory in my home dir, but that's not where I want to have it...

[15:20:06] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I think it makes sense to 'steer' the users in the right direction (and ease maintainability). Of course, users are completely free to configure Spacemacs how they like, but this can be done via configuration... not everything has to be supported by the 'core'. However, if it is easy to provide a general search function, while letting users choose the backend, or let Spacemacs automatically detect the backend, 
[15:20:06] <FromGitter> ... then I would prefer to provide that option (I think that is how it is now). We could explicitly state that, athough different options are provided, only 'ripgrep' is officially supported (or something like that)...

[19:56:00] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Haha... exactly

[19:56:46] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Very strange
[19:57:40] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Because it showed up in the thread... then after 5 seconds it said something like 'message has been deleted'... and then only your message was left on the screen
[19:57:58] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> damn I just found that Gitter's original developer is now subsidiary of GitLab

[20:02:44] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah... so maybe that happened automatically, and then it got 'approved'

[20:05:36] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's really bad
