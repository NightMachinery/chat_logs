[01:06:48] <mooz> the only way I see of doing it the way you're intending is if I put all the hostnames into a single file and put logic in the wrapper to back them up based on what hostnames they are... what sense does that make?

[01:23:26] <earendel> i love you bash. a bit.
[01:23:41] <earendel> cheers.
[01:23:49] <greycat> The main issue here is that bash can't really store an associative array of lists, which is what this REALLY is.  So you're storing an associative array of STRINGS, with each string being a pseudo-list that you have to word-split into existence later.  Which is horrible.
[01:23:50] <emanuele6> (with `< "$hostsfile"' after done obviously)
[01:24:14] <mooz> I know it is... that's why I called it a bashified associative array

[07:45:09] <nf> is there any way to make read -n count bytes instead of characters? should i just use head -c?
[07:45:43] <greycat> head -c will read a buffer, which may be quite more than you want it to read
[07:46:08] <greycat> your best bet is probably to set LC_ALL=C for the read

[18:28:49] <checkbot> gtlsgamr: I think the problem is on line 24. Since you double quoted this, it will not word split, and the loop will only run once. See 21 issues on https://shellcheck.net/?id=cb75529

[18:30:23] <Soliton> !basename
[18:30:23] <greybot> basename(1) can strip the directory and extension from a path (dir/subdir/file.ext -> file.ext or file). A parameter expansion can do it cleaner and *much* faster: "${path##*/}", "${path%.*}", at the cost of missing edge cases like path=/ or path=/path/to/dir/

[22:47:21] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/004 -- How can I check whether a directory is empty or not?  How do I check for any *.mpg files, or count how many there are?
[22:47:49] <twkm> though i approve of earnest's suggestion.
[22:48:50] <olspookishmagus> when actually a better approach would be if that directory contains at least one file then skip it but if it doesn't then delete it recursively (along with it's empty subdirectories)
[22:49:00] <olspookishmagus> :-1s/when/well/
[22:49:09] <olspookishmagus> in my case that is

[22:55:08] <earnest> Really at the core of erlang and the idea of failure.  Instead of checking some set of proxy conditions, just try to use it and let it fail if it can't
[22:55:56] <earnest> (This is not /quite/ the same as the 'look before you leap' vs. 'ask for forgiveness' idea, but it is similar)
[22:56:37] <earnest> Also by just attempting to achieve what you want to do and letting it fail you also avoid exposing yourself to TOCTOUs, generally

[23:04:40] <twkm> or someone else wrote a script that depends on the directory existing.
