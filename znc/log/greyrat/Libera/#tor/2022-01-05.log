[01:15:48] <phillw> hi folks, a bit of confusion over what is happening 'back in the ussr' etc. I've just expended resources for a relay, should I destroy that and replace it with a bridge ??

[01:18:51] <xx> phillw: the ideal thing that the project is looking for is people providing non-public bringes to those who really need them

[01:22:14] <phillw> xx: I'm just on the main area for someone to make a decision of new relay or one of the hybrid bridges.
[01:22:57] <xx> well, in terms of priority, 1) exit nodes 2) bridges 3) entry nodes 4) relay nodes
[01:24:47] <phillw> xx: just checking on type of bridge, and I never knew a bridge was more important than a relay.
[01:25:21] <xx> all relays are public, hence easily and often blocked
[01:25:35] <xx> bridges are less public, but are given out through means that effectively make them public
[01:25:48] <xx> unless you run a private bridge and don't choose to publish it anywhere
[01:25:58] <xx> and only give it to those who need it
[01:26:48] <phillw> xx: https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/AEF6C1FBA0FC16F4931638BF065085B974D3E90F  Should I destroy it and re-create as a bridge ( the same for the new kid https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/5C8BC829C436731B50ED8657019E849EDF76B091  )
[01:27:42] <phillw> xx obfs4 or a snowflake proxy ?
[01:30:12] <xx> https://forum.torproject.net/t/help-censored-users-run-a-tor-bridge/704
[01:30:44] <xx> https://blog.torproject.org/tor-censorship-in-russia/
[01:30:56] <xx> both should provide some info as to what is needed most if your concern is russia
[01:31:52] <phillw> xx: USSR and China are not my only concerns, for example https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/AEF6C1FBA0FC16F4931638BF065085B974D3E90F runs directory services, is a guard etc. etc.
[01:35:23] <phillw> bauruine[m]: The rule of thumb is if you have a fast connection and a lot of bandwidth to spare run a relay else a bridge.
