[19:32:26] <borodust> allllriiight, back at lispin'
[19:34:08] <thrig> pretty sure that ' needs to be at the start
[19:37:12] <borodust> looks like i'm missing backtick too
[19:37:24] <thrig> and probably some ()
[19:38:04] <borodust> thats what you get when you leave lisp alone for a second

[20:44:27] <borodust> quote in backtick is often mean troubles :D
[20:46:30] <borodust> whatever new english i just discovered
[21:05:15] <aeth> everything's fine
[21:05:21] <aeth> until you put a ` in a `
[21:06:13] <aeth> it's fairly easy to avoid... just use separate functions, perhaps inside of EVAL-WHEN, or at least use LET/FLET at the top level of the DEFMACRO
[21:06:24] <aeth> but so many people think that they can get away with it, just this one time...
