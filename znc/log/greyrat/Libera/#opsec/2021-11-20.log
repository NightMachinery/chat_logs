[15:14:30] <Joanna> jan6: I think in the case of crashing Boeing because autopilot was faulty there were pilots who had gotten too used to using autopilot for everything and had forgotten how to fly the plane. To keep it from crashing it was necessary to completely disengage the autopilot and maybe they trusted it too much.
[15:14:52] <jan6> of course
[15:17:43] <Joanna> Sometimes the software doesn’t let driver take over like instances of cars deciding to accelerate against the wishes of the driver and passenger. I don’t know if shifting to neutral would have worked or not.
[15:20:36] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: I’m not sure if all elevators even have a way to get to the roof and even if they do it requires being able to do a pull up or have something to stand on . Not everyone can do pull-ups and even if you get onto roof of elevator then what ? You are still trapped probably
[15:25:45] *** Joins: lind{at}yahoo (uid486956@tinside.irccloud.com)
[15:28:19] <gartt> There are some really good articles on Airbus vs Boeing and the merits (and against) of automation overriding a human's controls in cases in which it saved the day (and failed)
[15:29:26] <Joanna> It’s now possible to remotely control planes . I remember hearing about global hawk.
[15:31:14] <Joanna> I don’t know how many planes currently in existence have back doorbell that allow them to be remote controlled. I believe the pretext was to prevent hijackers from taking control
[15:33:03] <CalimeroTeknik> eh, I do rock-climbing
[15:33:33] <Joanna> Back door disregard doorbell ... stupid spell correction did it :(
[15:34:08] <Joanna> I’ve never been able to to a pull-up in my life.
[15:34:29] <CalimeroTeknik> the guy in the elevator looks up for a while
[15:34:54] *** Quits: genera (~Genera@user/genera) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:35:50] <Joanna> Even if you rappell down the shaft I doubt that there is a way out is there ?
[15:36:55] <CalimeroTeknik> of course there is: each pair of doors at each floor
[15:37:18] <Joanna> I think there was a video of adventurous young men getting themselves killed by an elevator
[15:37:37] <CalimeroTeknik> sure
[15:38:05] <Joanna> Do the doors open ? And what if elevator comes down ?or goes up when you don’t want it to ?
[15:38:10] <CalimeroTeknik> that's why, to maximize your chances to get out of it alive, you need to be both a computer scientist and rock climber :p
[15:38:47] <CalimeroTeknik> if it comes down, well, so long; if it comes up (not too fast), it's possible to get back in fast enough not to be crushed at the top
[15:38:47] <Joanna> Or not take the elevator at all..
[15:39:11] <CalimeroTeknik> if you're already at the top, open the doors, you can exit
[15:39:14] <Joanna> Id sooner run up 100 flights of stairs..
[15:39:41] <Joanna> Exit into what ?
[15:39:48] <CalimeroTeknik> the top floor of the building
[15:40:00] <CalimeroTeknik> open one pair of doors, open two pairs of doors, there you are
[15:40:25] <CalimeroTeknik> the guy staying 41h was facing the shaft, bummer; had to come out, the doors would be right there
[15:40:26] <Joanna> Are they hard to open ?
[15:40:49] <CalimeroTeknik> no, but if they're locked, you have an unlock mechanism you can simply activate
[15:41:04] <CalimeroTeknik> it's only accessible from the shaft
[15:41:48] <Joanna> I’m surprised he could open the doors at all
[15:42:05] <CalimeroTeknik> well, that's pretty much standard
[15:42:17] <CalimeroTeknik> the elevator will do an emergency stop if you ever do that while it's moving though
[15:42:54] <Joanna> I’ve never tried but I don’t see how you can even get a grip on them
[15:43:11] <CalimeroTeknik> the rounded corners offer enough grip
[15:43:59] <CalimeroTeknik> then again I have some force in my little fingers with rock climbing, so I don't know what it's like for everyone
[15:45:48] <Joanna> So most can’t escape from elevator so best to avoid them
[15:46:54] <CalimeroTeknik> bah, I'm sure you could open the doors
[15:47:26] <CalimeroTeknik> more often than not, they are in several parts and you can just push on the big fat edge of the second panel
[15:55:35] <jan6> also at elevators, NEVER climb out of the cabin, because the cabin is designed to keep you safe, accessways aren't, and even climbing out when it's between floors could be dangerous
[15:55:53] <jan6> Mr Elevator Hacker said so
[16:02:04] <CalimeroTeknik> sure, but when you've been in for hours… if you have the capabilities of an elevator hacker, I won't stop you from risking a very carefully planned exit rather than die trapped
[16:02:58] <jan6> sure
[16:08:12] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: don’t go in there to begin with then you won’t get trapped..
[16:08:36] <Joanna> Why were you going to die trapped?
[16:10:00] <CalimeroTeknik> eh, I guess the guy of 41h didn't die
[16:10:12] <CalimeroTeknik> I would definitely have exited after an hour or two
[16:10:35] <Joanna> Where ? It was a wall
[16:10:53] <CalimeroTeknik> we discussed this… breaking through the roof unless impossible
[16:11:12] <Joanna> Then what ?
[16:11:22] <CalimeroTeknik> next floor up
[16:11:34] <CalimeroTeknik> did you understand the rationale?
[16:12:02] <Joanna> It was an express there were many floors skipped
[16:12:36] <CalimeroTeknik> if you're facing the shaft, it means that right on top of the elevator is a door leading to the next floor up
[16:12:37] <CalimeroTeknik> open it, exit, done
[16:12:50] <CalimeroTeknik> it needs unlocking but finding the lever to do that is going to be the only hurdle
[16:14:01] <Joanna> Even if elevator skips the floor?
[16:18:22] <jan6> how do you think you're gonna unlock the next floor, even if you get behind the doors?
[16:18:43] <jan6> there's specifically safeguards to NOT open the door, unless the elevator is level with it
[16:19:26] <jan6> and normal people can't open it from the outside either
[16:43:23] *** Joins: genera (~Genera@user/genera)
[16:53:04] <CalimeroTeknik> it can only be opened from inside the shaft
[17:13:47] <gartt> Joanna: My company built the Global Hawk
[17:14:15] <gartt> I believe it has the longest endurance of any rigid aircraft in service
