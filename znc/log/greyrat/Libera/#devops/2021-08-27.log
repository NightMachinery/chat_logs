[19:29:39] <PublicWiFi> how often do you guys build your own containers from total scratch?
[19:30:00] <PublicWiFi> I feel like from a sec standpoint its just better to build off of an official image, like alpine

[20:15:25] <go> PublicWiFi: depends what's in the container. For golang applications we use scratch. Alpine has CVEs sometimes.
[20:21:28] <PublicWiFi> ah okay thanks
[20:21:49] <PublicWiFi> what OS do you usually use?

[20:23:48] <go> on my dekstop or for containers that do need an OS? Then it is alpine.
[20:24:28] <go> I just wrote a golang tool that scans containers in the kubernetes repository for vulnerabilities using trivy scanner, we have the issue of containers being deployed for months and we don't know if they have vulns or not.
[20:24:37] <go> *in the kubernetes cluster
[20:25:50] <PublicWiFi> oh nice!
[20:26:03] <PublicWiFi> I'm in the middle of trying to get a "decent" grasp on docker then im moving to k8s
[20:26:13] <go> yeah, that's a good start
[20:27:04] <PublicWiFi> the container paradigm is a bit tricky to wrap my head around at first but im getting there lol
[20:27:29] <PublicWiFi> i know containers are meant to be disposable so i haven't gotten around to how they handle and store data yet
[20:27:31] <go> have you worked with virtual machines?
[20:27:35] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[20:27:40] <PublicWiFi> i come from a sysadmin background
[20:27:51] <PublicWiFi> i think my vm exp is why im having a hard time wrapping my head around containers lol
[20:28:05] <go> ah cool, on a high level, vms = containers, containers just don't have the kernel, they share that from the host machine
[20:28:44] <go> containers should be stateless (without any data), but if you do need to persist data, you need to look into volumes
[20:29:02] <PublicWiFi> so whats the practical use of a stateless machine in a prod environment?
[20:29:07] <PublicWiFi> mostly dev work?
[20:29:31] <go> a stateless machine is great for APIs, that get data, do something with it, pass it or respond back
[20:29:38] <PublicWiFi> ahhh I gotcha that makes a lot of sense
[20:29:55] <PublicWiFi> so that makes sense why containers are so big in the cloud industry
[20:29:59] <go> Also it's great if you have a stateless machine because you can run more than one, then you can load balance connections between it
[20:30:29] <go> Also if you run more than one, say 10, it doesn't matter if 1 is unavailable for a very seconds, you have 9 left, redundancy is so much easier
[20:30:31] <PublicWiFi> so a container can sit in front of a DB and be used to query it given some API calls
[20:30:45] <PublicWiFi> yeah that makes so much sense
[20:30:51] <go> yeah, and basically the application inside the container becomes an API interface for the DB
[20:30:53] <PublicWiFi> thanks, that kind of helped me get the purpose haha
[20:31:10] <PublicWiFi> neat, so are API interfaces really the main use you'd say?
[20:31:15] <PublicWiFi> of containers I mean
[20:31:16] <go> no worries (: I come from sysadmin as well, still consider myself a glorified sysadmin
[20:31:37] <PublicWiFi> the more devops tech I look at the more interested I am. it's seriously neat stuff
[20:31:46] <go> API interfaces are really broad, I'd say, containers are great for any kind of use case
[20:31:49] <PublicWiFi> just wish my current job had a need for this tech and I could apply it to the real world and get some real exp lol
[20:32:31] <go> for example elasticsearch or mongodb are great in containers as well, because they are in a cluster, data is persisted in each container, if one gets deleted and a new comes up, it copies data from the existing cluster members, the data is not persisted, it is stateless, but the data is also not lost
[20:33:44] <go> I like containers because there's a commonality between me and a developer, a developer has to create a container that runs their code, I run the container in production, this way I know the version of the underlying software is the same as the developer tested with, there is no difference, it's the same thing, more assurance
[20:34:15] <go> What I'd suggest is to just play around with these things, you can run containers on raspberry pis, find something you're interested in and apply it to that
[20:34:29] <go> Are you interested in hosting websites, host it on a docker container on a raspberry pi at home
[20:34:40] <go> Are you interested in home automation, do it with containers on a raspberry pi
[20:35:02] <go> you'll get valuable experience regardless and you'll be able to get an entry level devops job
[20:35:12] <PublicWiFi> home automation is a great idea 
[20:35:21] <go> you can even move forward by automating the deployment of those containers
[20:35:28] <go> deployments, testing, monitoring, etc.
[20:35:28] <PublicWiFi> yeah IaC is on my list
[20:35:35] <PublicWiFi> im trying to do this :D
[20:35:52] <PublicWiFi> devops earning potential seems to be higher than general sysadmin and remote work is more common too...
[20:35:58] <PublicWiFi> and its just neat stuff lol
[20:36:03] <go> and when you'll get to kubernetes, you're sysadmin knowledge will give you an edge over those who do not have that history, kubernetes routing is all iptables in the background, most k8s engineers don't know iptables anymore
[20:36:14] <PublicWiFi> ohhh nice
[20:36:33] <PublicWiFi> i haven't used *nix iptables in a while but I definitely know networking decent enough to get back up to speed
[20:36:35] <go>  There's a lot to learn, but hey, that's why we're in the business, no?
[20:36:41] <PublicWiFi> right!
[20:36:44] <PublicWiFi> whats life without challenge
[20:37:04] <go> One of the key project at my co is Direct Connect from AWS to a datacentre, my devops engineers don't know networking or BGP
[20:37:31] <PublicWiFi> my BGP is very rusty but im decently comfortable with VPNs/networking 
[20:37:33] <go> only the one mid level devops engineer who's also a former sysadmin

[20:37:41] <go> and me
[20:37:50] <PublicWiFi> interesting, glad to know my current skills will help haha
[20:37:51] <go> so we need to teach the others, he has an advantage when it comes to this
[20:37:54] <PublicWiFi> you're giving me hope! :D
[20:38:00] <go> any skill will help you in the devops world
[20:38:18] <go> I have colleagues who are former developers, they have an edge when we need to write some tooling or automation
[20:38:24] <go> but that's why we're here, to learn from each other
[20:38:37] <PublicWiFi> golang is also on my list to learn. I do a bit of C for my low-level hobby projects so golang seemed like the perfect language to learn
[20:38:40] <PublicWiFi> right!
[20:39:08] <go> The hardest part for me was to learn programing, it was so hard to change my mindset and even now I think I still think like a sysadmin when I write code
[20:39:09] <PublicWiFi> okay im fired up again lol
[20:39:13] <go> hahaha
[20:39:21] <go> glad I did some good deed today
[20:39:24] <PublicWiFi> yeah i def have a scripting mindset.. no need to optimize
[20:39:30] <PublicWiFi> whats 45 seconds to run comapred to 30? nothing to a sysadmin
[20:39:35] <go> hahaha
[20:40:00] <go> my biggest learning from development is testing, testing infrastructure brings huge benefits
[20:40:04] <PublicWiFi> i know nothing about programming fundamentals like data structures n stuff
[20:40:32] <go> 5 years ago I was googling what the difference between an integer and a string is (non-native english speaker here)
[20:44:24] <PublicWiFi> man you're firing me up
[20:44:41] <PublicWiFi> at this point I think a entry level devops position would pay the same I make now lol
[20:45:17] <go> Sometimes you don't need to run after money but after learning opportunity
[20:45:33] <go> If you get a good gig where you learn a lot and can work with great people, you'll go faster up the ladder
[20:46:21] <PublicWiFi> yeah you're probably right!
[20:47:22] <PublicWiFi> thanks for the help haha
[20:49:03] <go> No worries
