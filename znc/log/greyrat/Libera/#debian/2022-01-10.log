[00:25:44] <sney> it is the signing keyring to verify packages from fasttrack. apt uses it internally.

[00:26:12] <qweYYYT> is this the same functionality as apt-key add?
[00:26:22] <sney> it accomplishes the same thing
[00:26:39] <sney> debian keyrings are distributed as packages so they can be updated like any other package

[02:02:35] <OpenBDSM> it is a work notebook, I don't intend to play games on it (at least for now) and even if I do - they will probably be something like Ultima Online or ADOM which are too old for any of that to matter

[02:39:25] <at0m> the intel GPU does just fine for what i run. might have another opinion if i gamed.

[06:14:14] <Spice_Boy> well, the server is Wayland I'm pretty sure, and locally I don't think it is since installing nvidia
[06:14:51] <Spice_Boy> actually, wireshark works fine remotely
[06:15:04] <Spice_Boy> just virt-manager insists on displaying only on the server
[06:15:12] <jmcnaught> You might need to log into an X session instead of Wayland, it think it depends on which toolkit the application is using.
[06:15:17] <Spice_Boy> (if I worded that right)
[06:15:27] <jmcnaught> But for virt-manager I would just use its own remote feature
[06:15:39] <Spice_Boy> do you know where I should look for that feature?
[06:15:50] <jmcnaught> In the main virt-manager window go to File > add new connection
[06:17:46] <Spice_Boy> thanks.. I'll head to the server and look
[06:19:32] <jmcnaught> I mean you run virt-manager on the client (e.g. the laptop/desktop you're sitting at) and add a new remote ssh connection to it.
[06:19:34] <Spice_Boy> ah I see
[06:19:36] <Spice_Boy> yeah got it
[06:19:42] <Spice_Boy> just added it
[06:19:57] <Spice_Boy> it means I have to have virt-manager installed on my local machine though

[23:27:10] <zuQu> my wifii is AX201 - it should work with clean install
[23:27:28] <zuQu> I don;t need bluetooth (it;s even disabled in uefi)
[23:27:32] <sney> intel wifi requires firmware
[23:27:47] <zuQu> even AX120 i thought it's in kernel
[23:28:01] <sney> the driver is in the kernel, the firmware is required by the driver or it won't load
[23:28:10] <PerfDave> The driver can be in-kernel and still require firmware.
[23:28:13] <zuQu> ahh
[23:28:29] *** Quits: uuidNuniq (~weechat@80.251.208.245.16clouds.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:28:32] <zuQu> so what should i install to make it run?
[23:28:34] <PerfDave> The driver is the bit of the code that goes in the kernel. The firmware is the code that runs on the device.
[23:28:45] *** Joins: uuidNuniq (~weechat@80.251.208.245.16clouds.com)
[23:28:49] <zuQu> is it matter of quick apt-get install?
[23:28:57] <zuQu> or will i have do something more complicated?
[23:28:59] <sney> you use the firmware iso, or you install without wifi and install the firmware-iwlwifi package afterwards
[23:29:10] <zuQu> i can install with ethernet cable
[23:29:12] <sney> if you have an ethernet connection it's just apt install, yes
[23:29:25] <zuQu> like apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi ?
[23:29:30] <sney> exactly
[23:29:41] <sney> you would need to enable non-free in your sources.list first
[23:29:49] <zuQu> and i have to add "contrib non-free" to every line of source.list ?
[23:30:10] <PerfDave> If you want to install packages from the contrib and non-free repositories...
[23:30:48] <zuQu> cool
[23:31:18] <zuQu> I also have a question about update/upgrade cycle. Is that true that stable version is not often upgraded/updated
[23:31:25] <zuQu> and most packages are a little older?
[23:31:34] *** Joins: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck)
[23:31:57] <sney> stable packages are frozen at their version, and only updated with security patches and bugfixes
[23:32:42] <zuQu> ok, i mostly matter about security. So security fixed even in stable version are pushes as soon as possible, right?
[23:32:57] *** Joins: cdown_ (~cdown@163.114.131.1)
[23:33:01] <sney> righ
[23:33:44] <zuQu> cools, last question :)  - so non-free .iso is just free .iso with every apt-get install package from https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/firmware-nonfree  ?
[23:33:59] <sney> basically yes
[23:34:09] <zuQu> if i download free .iso and run apt-get install on every package lsited on the left down panel from https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/firmware-nonfree  i'll basically have firmware .iso
[23:34:18] <zuQu> well, so it looks like clean .iso is better
[23:34:21] <zuQu> even for a laptop
[23:34:25] <zuQu> if i have ethernet
[23:34:44] <sney> right, if you have ethernet it's better to only install the firmware package you need, instead of all of them
[23:34:45] <jelly> and if your GPU does not need firmware
[23:35:08] <jelly> and if your wired ethernet does not need firmware
[23:35:14] <zuQu> I have nvidia
[23:35:17] <sney> true
[23:35:21] <zuQu> so i guess i'll still have to install it
[23:35:27] <zuQu> i dont see it in firmware version

[23:35:54] <sney> nvidia will work with nouveau without firmware, it doesn't need it just to install the OS, so you can deal with it later
[23:36:00] *** Joins: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck)
[23:36:31] <sney> CPUs have microcode packages in non-free. they are optional and you can deal with that later as well
[23:36:36] <zuQu> what about CPU? E.g. my Intel supports Turbo Boost. Do I need to install any additional firmware to use it?
[23:37:08] <jelly> if the kernel supports using it, it will use it
[23:37:08] <zuQu> 11850H - i7
[23:37:20] <zuQu> how can i check that, would you mind check that for me?
[23:37:25] <zuQu> i7 - 11850H is my CPU
[23:37:28] <jelly> no thanks
[23:37:39] *** Joins: biblio (~biblio@user/biblio)
[23:37:46] <sney> I think microcode isn't needed for basic cpu features like that, it's mostly for intel to release fixes
[23:37:46] <zuQu> or point me where i can check that myself :)
[23:37:56] <sney> ,i intel-microcode

[23:38:27] <zuQu> yeah, but i just want to be sure, that when i install debian i'll using every feature from my CPU

[23:39:11] <zuQu> dpkg there might be some situations that i might even not notice that some feature of my CPU is missing
[23:39:12] <dpkg> I think you lost me on that one, zuQu
[23:39:19] <jelly> you won't be using every feature; most will however be _available_ should you find a piece of software that uses it
[23:39:45] <sney> and if you think you are missing functionality, then install the microcode package
[23:39:55] <jelly> sometimes BIOS and montherboard disable cpu features.
[23:39:55] <zuQu> e.g. I want encryption, my CPU supports fast encryption
[23:40:09] <zuQu> but im not sure if clean Debian install supports it too
[23:40:10] <sney> #debian does not know every detail of every feature of every cpu
[23:40:24] <zuQu> i mean AES-NI
[23:40:25] <sney> intel stuff is usually very well supported. but you will just have to try it on your computer and find out.
[23:40:28] <sussudio> some feature of your cpu is missing alright...
[23:40:44] <jelly> aes-ni has been present in intel cpus since 2010 or so
[23:40:58] <zuQu> jelly so you mean it's a must to be supported?
[23:41:04] <jelly> it works
[23:41:18] <sussudio> cat /proc/cpuinfo
[23:41:58] <jelly> I had it in uh... i5-660 I think
[23:42:23] <zuQu> but have you installed any additinal package? Or it was already implemented in kernel?
[23:43:05] *** Quits: Mihry (~Thunderbi@88.241.168.28) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:43:14] <jelly> kernel can use it when it's there
[23:43:25] <zuQu> ok, awesome
[23:43:31] <PerfDave> OTOH the firmware doesn't take up much disk space, so installing firmware-nonfree isn't really a big deal.
[23:43:33] <jelly> userspace can probably use it as well
[23:43:55] <zuQu> PerfDave you mean I can isntall all firmware at once?
[23:44:01] <jelly> I did not investigate details, I just noticed LUKS uses it
[23:44:20] <PerfDave> zuQu: You can install all the firmware packages, and the kernel will load them onto your devices as needed.
[23:44:44] <PerfDave> If you have firmware on your hard disk for a device you don't have, the kernel will just... not load it.
[23:44:51] <jelly> there's no sense installing firmware for hw that's not present at all
[23:45:08] <PerfDave> jelly: Doesn't really hurt though.
[23:45:12] <zuQu> PerfDave I mean, can I do it with one command at once, or you mean apt-get every package from https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/firmware-nonfree ?
[23:45:24] <jelly> I suppose it does not.
[23:46:21] <zuQu> damn, I can do apt-get install firmware-*
[23:46:31] <zuQu> but should I? :)
[23:46:35] <zuQu> as is it safe
