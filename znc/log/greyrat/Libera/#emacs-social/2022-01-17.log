[02:37:27] <GNUHacker> google is a "spy engine"
[02:45:02] <corwin> and like any great spy-network, it's thriving because we need the info :P
[03:41:05] <GNUHacker> i get info from other sources
[03:41:13] *** Quits: GNUHacker (~foobar@fsf/member/GNUHacker) (Quit: https://www.gnu.org/education/)
[03:43:00] <corwin> and so does google :D
