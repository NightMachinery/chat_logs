[00:22:33] <WilhelmVonWeiner> I applied to work for an online marketplace that considers itself a competitor to Amazon and they told me "for obvious reason" they use GCP instead of AWS
[00:23:04] <WilhelmVonWeiner> ...is that a bad reason to kindly reject proceeding further or is it shallow
[00:23:25] <Brekkjern> Isn't GCP generally a bit cheaper than AWS?
[00:23:56] <Brekkjern> I don't work much cloud, and when I do it's usually Azure, so I don't really know much about the differences.
[00:24:09] <bkero> Anything is cheaper than AWS

[00:28:25] <WilhelmVonWeiner> Brekkjern: nothing about pricing, just the reasoning provided seems inane
[00:29:12] <Brekkjern> Eh, it's a bit of both. AWS is way too integrated into Amazon (duh) so using it is contributing to lowering your competitions bottom line

[03:31:57] <ngoldbaum> has the compile time penalty of using serde gotten better?
[03:32:26] <ngoldbaum> ime in like 2019-2020 serde was a big contributor to long compile times on a lot of crates
[03:49:02] <drakonis> how does it manage that?
[03:49:31] <kline> Church | I find JSON pretty easy (assuming you can turn it into a struct)
[03:50:26] <kline> theres at least 1 endpoint that doesnt produce anything that i can slap a derive(Serialize, Deserialize) on
[03:51:04] <kline> json!() does help in producing though
[03:52:04] <kline> in the meantime im doing a lot of imperative probing and unwrap_or()s
[03:52:28] <Church> Really? What's the endpoint?
[03:52:43] <Church> json! Helps a ton
[03:53:01] <kline> its receving an abitrary json blob from a client
[03:54:26] <kline> so right now im using serde_json::from_string() and then walking that structure
[03:55:58] <Church> How arbitrary? Always changing?
[03:58:00] <kline> it should have at least some bits and those are all i am checking for
[03:58:23] <kline> i wonder if serde will just ignore the bits that are not relevant to my struct

[16:55:06] <gwozniak> Is there a better ad for Unix out there?  I've not seen it. ;)

[16:55:40] <river> but i tend to google a lot of stuff that I could in theory calculate offline
[16:56:13] <gwozniak> M-x calc will do it, but to say it's intuitive would not be exactly accurate
[16:56:36] <river> sometimes its nice to just write stuff like  3:34 and 12 hours 15 mins, rather than 12*60*60+15

[16:58:26] <river> nice :)
[16:58:51] <Brekkjern> I love that PowerShell has built in variables for common byte sizes
[16:59:15] <gwozniak> Isn't that only 8 bits? ;)
[16:59:16] <Brekkjern> So you can actually just write stuff like 15 * 1GB and get the number of bytes that 15GB is
[16:59:41] <Brekkjern> It's really handy when commands return things as bytes or KB or something like that
[17:01:31] <river> yeah stuff like this
