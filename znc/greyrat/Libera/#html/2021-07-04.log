[18:46:08] <BenoitRen> Hi everyone. How does one mark up an onomatopoeia? I remember searching for the answer before, but just like now, I didn't find anything even discussing it. My guess would be <i>, as I've seen it in italics, but maybe there's something more appropriate?

[19:13:05] <entuland> <i> isn't strictly tied to italics anymore, I, EM and STRONG and possibly others have been changed from strictly appearance to more semantic uses
[19:15:24] <entuland> using <i> for an onomatopoeia looks fine to me
[19:31:35] <Visage> Since it's in an "alternate voice", yes, <i> is fine for onomatopoeia.
[19:32:07] <Visage> "Alternative voice or mood"
[19:58:27] <BenoitRen> I know about the changes. I had deduced that it wasn't stress <em>phasis, so that only left <i>, as it didn't find any of the elements that traditionally bolded things.
[19:58:48] <BenoitRen> "didn't fit"
[20:00:32] <BenoitRen> How far does "alternative voice" go, anyway? One author bolded a dark creature's speech with bold, which I took to be purely cosmetic. He did the same thing to the speech of a cyborg in another story.
[20:15:23] <Visage> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i -- See the "Usage Notes" section for some examples of where it might be used.
[20:26:04] <BenoitRen> I already read that.
