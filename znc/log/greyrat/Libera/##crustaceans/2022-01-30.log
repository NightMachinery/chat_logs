[01:36:43] <gwozniak> I made an impulse buy of David Greaber's last book when I went to order The Expanse books and pick up another one I had ordered
[01:37:51] <gwozniak> I'm reading some books by local authors.  Turns out the author of the latest one I read lives very close to me
[01:41:17] <gwozniak> The next local author book is either going to be a fun sci-fi romp or absolute trash.  I can't tell.

[01:47:31] <manicennui> There are several "literary fiction" authors from Chicago, but I have no interest in that genre.
[01:49:56] <manicennui> I think Chicago mostly benefits from having a large number of people.
[01:50:08] <manicennui> There isn't a strong cultural identity.
[01:50:16] <manicennui> We're pretty consumeristic really.
[01:50:46] <manicennui> I think the thing most closely associated with Chicago culture wise might be the economists who came from U of Chicago.

[02:52:29] <manicennui> One thing I don't understand about the transplant thing: won't their immunity from the vaccine be useless because of the immunosuppressive medications?
[03:16:47] <edk> i would imagine not entirely useless
[03:19:48] <edk> i think people who have no immune function will just die, reliably and quite quickly, if they're exposed to the world outside a clean room

[08:07:14] <buttsbot> Could turning Texas into ‚ÄòBitcoin Country‚Äô actually bolster the state‚Äôs electric grid?
[08:07:15] <imode> something in the water
[08:07:15] <manicennui> JFC
[08:07:33] <manicennui> "The idea is that the miners‚Äô computer arrays would demand so much electricity that someone would come along to build more power plants, something Texas badly needs"
[08:07:34] <manicennui> ?!?
[08:08:15] <manicennui> "If the grid starts to go wobbly, as it did when winter storm Uri froze up power plants in February 2021, miners could quickly shut down to conserve energy for homes and businesses."
[08:08:21] <manicennui> Much altruism!
[08:08:29] <manicennui> What a fucking joke.
[08:08:32] <imode> y'know what.
[08:08:34] <imode> do it.
[08:08:36] <manicennui> I hope they do it and the state fucking collapses
[08:08:36] <imode> fucking do it.
[08:09:16] <manicennui> "There‚Äôs no guarantee anyone will build more generation or switch off just because they‚Äôre asked. There‚Äôs even a chance the idea could backfire and put more strain on the grid overall. But at last October‚Äôs meeting at the governor‚Äôs mansion, Abbott made it clear that he was going to count on the miners‚Äô assistance when the electricity grid faced colder months ahead."
[08:09:33] <manicennui> You know, I never thought of this angle.
[08:09:51] <manicennui> They should figure out how much electricity is being used by Texans for crypto mining.
[08:09:56] <imode> texas is in a perpetual state of holding a gun to his head and saying "I'LL DO IT. I'LL FUCKING DO IT. WATCH ME. I'LL FUCKING DO IT."
[08:09:59] <manicennui> Then let them know that they could have prevented deaths.
[08:10:05] <imode> in fact the whole south is.
[08:10:25] <imode> eventually they'll actually pull the trigger.
[08:10:27] <manicennui> "Was the crypto worth 246 deaths?"
[08:10:32] <manicennui> Get the average person pissed at them.
[08:10:42] <imode> the average person would praise the deaths.
[08:11:33] <manicennui> Apparently the Texas power outage fucked a large number of states outside of Texas because prices for fuel went up.
[08:11:49] <imode> were they adjacent states.
[08:12:20] <manicennui> "To cover debt incurred due to high natural gas prices, utilities outside Texas have had to raise prices. Oklahoma Natural Gas is charging customers up to $7.80 per month for the next 25 years to securitize its costs of $1.4 billion during the crisis.[127]"
[08:12:28] <manicennui> I think there were states pretty far away that were affected.
[08:13:03] <imode> wild.
[08:13:33] <imode> the next step is to just stop supplying any kind of utilities to texas.
[08:13:49] <imode> bootstraps, texas independence, etc.
[08:13:57] <imode> let them die in their own man made disaster.
[08:14:55] <manicennui> The South is actually becoming very purple, but Republicans use gerrymandering and vote suppression to hold on to votes.
[08:15:08] <imode> then let their imminent demise turn them blue.
[08:15:10] <manicennui> There are a few states that would probably be blue by now otherwise.
[08:15:20] <manicennui> Even Texas is much closer than one would think.
[08:15:28] <imode> and then let the blue candidates do absolutely fucking nothing for their constituents.
[08:15:31] <imode> apart from holding up the status quo.
[08:15:44] <imode> such is life under higher rule.
[08:15:49] <manicennui> Sure, but that is the best that we can hope for.
[08:15:56] <manicennui> Not actively fucking people over, mostly.
[08:16:05] <imode> no, just passively fucking people over.

[08:16:25] <imode> one dude hammered a nail into your hand, the other just lets you handle the results of it.

[08:17:13] <imode> I would rather no nails in anywhere.
[08:17:20] <manicennui> Fixing things would require changes so drastic that they will never happen.
[08:17:26] <manicennui> That isn't an option though.

[09:06:15] <defect> nice, thanks. will definitely look in to those more
[09:06:42] <gwozniak> Two key differences: the motor is on the bottom (so the bottom turns) and it has a 7-year warranty vs. the usual 1 year
[09:06:43] <manicennui> And importantly, they come in several colors.
[09:06:57] <gwozniak> Sorry, bowl turns, not the bottom
[09:07:08] <gwozniak> And it has no cool down time
[09:07:25] <manicennui> I see photos of it on its side and turned into what looks like a meat grinder or something.
[09:07:41] <gwozniak> Yes, there are plenty of attachments for doing that stuff
[09:08:06] <gwozniak> KitchenAids have those too, although I don't know if they have a blender
[09:08:25] <manicennui> Yeah.
[09:08:58] <gwozniak> KitchenAids are really good too
[09:09:21] <gwozniak> One nice thing about the Ankarsrum is that the top is mostly open, so pouring in ingredients is easy
[09:09:39] <defect> those are mostly what i've been looking at so far. seemed like the go-to stand mixer
[09:10:14] <gwozniak> You won't go wrong with a KitchenAid.  They were just too big for our place
[09:10:29] <manicennui> I've heard KitchenAid is made more cheaply now.
[09:10:33] <manicennui> Like most kitchen things.
[09:10:34] <gwozniak> We have a huge apartment, but a tiny and oddly placed kitchen
[09:10:40] <defect> but not sold more cheaply?
[09:10:49] <manicennui> defect: Of course not.
[09:10:54] <defect> hehe
[09:11:16] <gwozniak> Cuisinart is the cheaper version of a KitchenAid
[09:11:35] <gwozniak> Not a fan of their stuff
[09:11:55] <gwozniak> We've had some of it for a while and it just breaks down in a hurry
[09:12:06] <gwozniak> Our coffee maker just went to shit in no time
[09:12:43] <gwozniak> I hate throwaway culture so much
[09:12:52] <defect> i have a cuisinart food processor that's been pretty good. not a power user or anything but it's worked for the things i make
[09:13:04] <gwozniak> Well, I hope it holds up for you
[09:13:49] <gwozniak> Actually, our food processor might be a Cuisinart and it's still doing alright
[09:14:22] <gwozniak> Can't remember and I don't want to go look :P
[09:14:54] <gwozniak> Maybe it's doing okay because there is no software in it
[09:14:59] <defect> yeah, i hope it holds up too. nothing like a kitchen tool that you've been able to keep for years and years
[09:15:06] <gwozniak> totally
[09:15:40] <gwozniak> We spent good money on a Staub Dutch oven years ago and it was a terrific purchase
[09:15:47] <manicennui> I just bought a high end hand grinder for coffee, and its construction is really impressive.
[09:16:35] <defect> one of my favorite things in my kitchen are a bunch of towels i got from my grandma. nice quality, embroidered, and looking as good as new even after many years
[09:16:51] <gwozniak> it's amazing how useful that sort of thing is
[09:17:30] <defect> oh yeah. and having a few of them too is nice
[09:18:49] <manicennui> The new fad in towels is flour sack towels.
[09:19:22] <gwozniak> I was not aware of towel fads
[09:19:43] <defect> that sounds.. not great for actually towelling stuff
[09:20:06] <manicennui> They are supposedly much better.
[09:20:09] <defect> huh
[09:20:16] <manicennui> They are thin, large, and don't give off lint.

[20:07:47] <companion_cube> Which sounds right
[20:08:02] <companion_cube> Did you get a physical copy? Seems like hardcover ain't cheap
[20:08:12] <gwozniak> It outlines a very strong case that the order of things is really credit -> money -> barter instead of the other way around
[20:08:24] <gwozniak> I have a softcover edition
[20:08:30] <companion_cube> I've been reading acoup.blog a lot and it does make a vibrant call for seeing things though the historical lens
[20:09:07] <companion_cube> Ah, like credit in small tribes? Based on honor or something like that? :)
[20:09:09] <gwozniak> manicennui: yeah, I saw that before I went to bed, which is the mistake I made
[20:09:19] <companion_cube> I'll try to find a copy, thank you
[20:09:24] <gwozniak> companion_cube: yes, very much along those lines
[20:09:37] <gwozniak> barter is something you do with people you don't trust
[20:09:45] <companion_cube> Nice.
[20:10:39] <gwozniak> It made me think about what is the most efficient way to pay someone.  And the case Graeber's makes is that it's really saying, "I owe you"

[23:01:28] <dmc> nice
[23:01:32] <kline> problem is the matrix bridge is quite fragile and never managed to recover until someone at matrix was able to coax it back to life
[23:02:40] <kline> like, hands up, the root cause for this happening at all is libera, but we immediately fixed our shit, and the rest has been the bridge being unable to handle what should be routine realities of networked life
[23:03:22] <dmc> growing pains \o/
[23:03:28] <kline> it could just have easily been a not-libera cause and the same symptoms would exist
[23:03:42] <kline> well, im unconvinced its growing pains, the bridge has never been reliable
[23:03:47] <imode> so, the matrix bridge is shit, got it.
[23:03:48] <kline> its been this way for years
[23:04:47] <kline> a good example is when irccloud has some network issues, that will usually destablise the bridge for days, until someone from matrix restarts it
[23:05:36] <dmc> hopefully they sort it out
[23:06:26] <kline> i dont think thats likely, the modus operandi for matrix has been to try and get as many users as possible to get growth-related funding - its the standard silicon valley playbook
[23:06:57] <kline> technical debt is unimportant, and its why synapse is a tyre fire, why dendrite has been in development hell for years, and the bridge never really gets better
[23:07:31] <kline> i think the aim is to just try and get a critical mass of users and then start turning bridges off and hope the network effect means communities feel they need to make a choice between one or the other, and pick matrix
[23:08:11] <dmc> hmm
[23:08:14] <kline> problem is, im unconvinced that all of this technical debt can be fixed, at which point matrix will collapse and those communities then need to re-migrate back to irc, or possibly to proprietary walled gardens like slack or discord
[23:08:15] <drakonis> that's some horrible shit.
[23:09:16] <imode> well, I won't be using their shit then.
[23:09:19] <kline> reminder: almost all development is done by 1 for-profit organisation that has nearly gone bust in the past
[23:09:48] <kline> as far as i know, theyre the only ones who run the identity provider stuff as well, but im not as well versed in the background for that
[23:09:53] <kline> and they run almost all the bridges
[23:10:17] <kline> matrix is extremely centralised for a decentralised/federated protocol
[23:10:33] <kline> both in terms of infrastructure and development
[23:11:34] <kline> its sad, because i was extremely excited about matrix back when they were selling themselves as a single common backbone for inter-protocol compat
[23:13:04] <imode> I was always skeptical of their approach.
[23:13:09] <kline> but as far as i can see, thats now retained only so that people coming on-board have a lower cost ie dont lose access to their other communities until they are fully migrated
