[05:12:15] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:14:49] <kepstin> yes; the method depends on the exact type of conversion you want. Do you want to downmix? or grab only just two of the 6 channels?
[05:14:50] <Guddu> I read about -ac 2 option at https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AudioChannelManipulation
[05:15:14] <Guddu> kepstin, Downmix as I don't want to lose the LFE
[05:15:27] <Guddu> And By default when using -ac 2 the LFE channel is omitted
[05:17:59] <Guddu> I mean. Is there a way to downmix without losing the LFE channel?
[05:18:44] <furq> -af "pan=stereo|FL=0.5*FC+0.707*FL+0.707*BL+0.5*LFE|FR=0.5*FC+0.707*FR+0.707*BR+0.5*LFE"
[05:18:47] <furq> adjust values to taste
[05:20:55] <Guddu> Thanks furq Are those values the default when -ac 2 is used (except the LFE ofcourse)
[05:21:45] <furq> i think so
[05:22:15] <furq> those are from the atsc recommendations which i assume is what -ac uses
[05:22:40] <kepstin> note that ac3 audio apparently signals downmix coefficients :/
[05:22:46] <kepstin> i dunno if ffmpeg actually uses them
[05:23:33] <furq> if this is mxf i doubt it's using ac3
[05:24:40] <Guddu>  I have one more question. If i want to join a Company Intro Video of 5 seconds with the feature film prores video file so that the intro plays at the start of the output video then will the whole duration of the video be encoded? Also will the audio of the feature prores maintain in synch? or will it be shifted by 5 seconds in that case?
[05:25:36] <kepstin> the answers to both of those questions are "you can tell ffmpeg to do either option"
[05:26:23] <kepstin> but if the intro video and main feature are both in the same codec/settings/etc. then you should be able to concatenate them without re-encoding and keeping sync.
[05:26:29] <furq> you can concat two videos together without reencoding as long as they're similar enough
[05:26:36] <furq> idk what that would mean for prores, probably just resolution and framerate
[05:26:54] <Guddu> kepstin, The problem is that my 5 second intro is not prores. I shall probably convert it first and then join both.
[05:27:11] <kepstin> yeah, if you want to avoid re-encoding the movie, then that would be best.
[05:31:55] <SnakesAndStuff> bitstream is amazing :D

[08:22:25] <Akaza> Hi! I am trying to develop a way of determining if an MP4 video uses the YUV444P pixel format as quickly as possible. I am able to tell by using "ffprobe -show_frames" on the video, and check the pix_fmt for every frame. The problem is that this is way too slow.
[08:23:04] <Akaza> I'm wondering if anyone knows where I can find information on where pixel format data is stored, and how to read it. I haven't worked with MP4 files much, but I have some idea of how the format works.
[08:24:13] <Akaza> But since I am only looking for a very specific directive, I figure that parsing the file is slower than simply doing a search for the pixel-format = yuv444p, and if that is present, assume it is used at least once.
[08:24:53] <Akaza> The issue is that I can't find any info on where this directive is stored. That is, how does FFMPEG figure this out? Where are those bits stored?
[08:25:19] <Akaza> In the MP4 file it doesn't actually say "yuv444p", it says something else, and that's what I gotta find.
[08:26:43] *** Joins: Volgaar (~volgaar@40.34.6.93.rev.sfr.net)
[08:29:34] <kepstin> the quick way is to run "ffprobe -show_streams"
[08:29:38] <furq> Akaza: ffprobe -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=pix_fmt
[08:30:19] <kepstin> the pixel format that a video will decode to can be determined from the codec metadata without actually decoding any metadata, indeed.
[08:30:30] <kepstin> without actually decoding any video*
[08:32:14] <Akaza> None of these work, because it assumes the pixel format is the same throughout the file. What I need to determine if wether or not a specific pixel format is used in ANY frame, not just the first one, or in the first stream.
[08:32:37] <kepstin> mp4 doesn't support having the pixel format change within a stream, tho.
[08:33:34] <Akaza> It does. The problem I am trying to solve is the infamous Chrome and Discord-crashing GIFs, which are MP4 files that start off using YUV420, and then change to YUV444 halfway in, which causes hardware accelerated clients to freeze.
[08:33:42] <kepstin> doing that requires re-initializing the codec, and mp4 only stores one copy of the codec initialization data
[08:34:05] <kepstin> ok, so these are bad mp4 files which can't be seeked in. nasty :(
[08:34:18] <furq> yeah the reason those crash stuff is because it's not really legal
[08:34:25] <furq> so naturally the container doesn't give you any provision to figure that out
[08:34:43] <kepstin> yeah, no way to tell without scanning through all the frames, since the container doesn't know that the codec gets reinitialized partway through
[08:35:10] <kepstin> and you would need to run the decoder - or at least a parser, not sure - to figure it out :(
[08:36:06] <furq> if it's h264 then the pixel format is in the sps so i guess just a parser would do it
[08:36:28] <furq> ffprobe can't do it but maybe something like h264bitstream will show it
[08:37:07] <furq> i think i tried it with h264_analyze and it worked but that was ages ago
[08:37:32] *** Joins: pk08 (~phk@27.57.183.73)
[08:37:52] <furq> also if it's mp4 and browsers play it then it must be h264
[08:38:21] <Akaza> Yeah, that's correct. I'll have a look at that, thanks a bunch!
[08:39:42] <kepstin> does seem like a bug if the hardware decoder hangs rather than erroring out, but who knows what's going on in there :/
[08:40:57] <kepstin> browsers really do need to be able to handle arbitrary malicious input in a reasonable way
[08:41:13] <Guddu> Would AAC to PCM 24Bit be a lossy conversion?
[08:41:37] <furq> no but it would be a waste
[08:41:43] <kepstin> Guddu: the aac encoding was the lossy conversion.
[08:41:43] <furq> but also if you're downmixing then yes
[08:41:48] <kepstin> that's just decoding the aac.
[08:41:54] <furq> Akaza: you're looking for sps->chroma_format_idc
[08:42:22] <furq> i guess i was testing something different but i have a file with two sets of sps values
[08:42:29] <furq> so hopefully that works
[08:42:40] <Guddu> The problem is that I ended up doing -ac 2 for converting to Stereo from 5.1 and that took a while and I just noticed that i needed PCM Lineal 24 Bit audio.
[08:43:07] <furq> -c:a pcm_s24le

[15:27:57] <youmustrust> Guys, I got some intermittent audio clipping sound with HLS on Safari. The problem does occur for 44.1khz audio, but not for 48khz. I suspected it's something to do with PTS, so I extracted all unique pts diffs from 44.1khz hls audio. The diffs are [2050, 2051, 2070, 2089, 2090, 2140, 2141, 2160]. Are those PTS diffs odd? I want to fix it, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
[15:29:35] <youmustrust> On the other hand, 48khz audio diffs looks even: [1860, 1890, 1920, 1950, 1980]. Hmm...

[18:33:09] <arkanoid> what's my best bet to put live video in browser today? WebRTC, HSL, DASH, other?
[18:35:39] <BtbN> They all kinda suck
[18:35:58] <BtbN> Easiest is to stream to Twitch or YouTube and embed that
[18:37:22] <arkanoid> sadly not pussible, it should work in lan or via vpn, no third parties
[18:37:44] <arkanoid> nothing serious, but I was thinking about trying something new
[18:38:16] <arkanoid> was reading about using emscripten + ffmpeg to grab rtsp and convert to local HSL and pass that to <video> html5 element
[18:39:36] <BtbN> If you hate your users CPU, sure
[18:39:37] <kepstin> the simplest option is to use HLS with something like ffmpeg's hls muxer and an http server doing static file serving. Note that you'll need to use a js MSE player library for best support.
[18:39:56] <BtbN> Keep in mind that doing that will give you a huge delay
[18:40:07] <BtbN> All the various streaming services have proprietary solutions to avoid that
[18:42:14] <arkanoid> BtbN: why are you saying that? there's no decoding involved, just remuxing
[18:42:38] <BtbN> That still going to be quite CPU intensive if done via that insane indirection
[18:43:16] <arkanoid> yeah, possibly yes, but unsure if emscripten whould introduce that overhead
[18:43:37] <arkanoid> I mean, it is remuxed and cached in ram, then video element does the rest
[18:43:38] <BtbN> No ASM optimizations for obvious reasons, and a whole bunch of JavaScript
[18:44:11] <BtbN> If you want to throw a ton of JS at it, just stream fragmented mp4 to it directly
[18:44:55] <DeHackEd> browsers typically support DASH these days, right?
[18:45:26] <arkanoid> DeHackEd: https://caniuse.com/mpeg-dash
[18:46:27] <BtbN> DASH is HLS with more XML, not really much of a difference otherwise
[18:46:39] <BtbN> And both need a ton of JS to handle. Neither is natively supported.
[18:47:49] <arkanoid> wait a sec, why this says HSL is not supported in firefox and chrome? https://caniuse.com/http-live-streaming
[18:48:28] <BtbN> Because it isn't.
[18:48:36] <BtbN> Only Safari supports it natively
[18:48:57] <BtbN> That's why you throw a shitton of JS at it

[19:03:38] <arkanoid> thanks for all the answers
[19:07:57] <any1> I'd say your best bet is WebRTC, but it has a rather steep learning curve
[19:09:07] <arkanoid> any1: I just need to know if it would let me view a live rtsp stream (over tcp) straight from a ip camera without an intermediate server
[19:09:27] <arkanoid> I'd like a browser solution where I paste an rtsp url and I get live video stream
[19:10:22] <any1> what do you mean by "intermediate server"?
[19:11:09] <arkanoid> any1: that no transcoding or remuxing is required on a third host between the browser client and the ip camera
[19:11:23] <BtbN> You can't just "stream WebRTC" to a Browser though
[19:11:45] <any1> You're going to need to set up an http server to serve your site and something to mux the video stream
[19:12:01] <arkanoid> exactly, I'd need a third server between camera and host, that's why I'm not considering webrtc now
[19:12:02] <BtbN> and something to actually talk WebRTC and pretend to be another p2p device
[19:13:13] <any1> I don't see how you can do HLS or DASH within that criteria either
[19:14:27] <arkanoid> wasm compiled ffmpeg?
[19:14:54] <any1> But the browser isn't allowed to open arbitrary network connections
[19:15:06] <BtbN> Both of those protocols work via HTTP, so, yes it can?
[19:15:10] <BtbN> That's their whole point

[19:15:58] <any1> Earlier, they were talking about grabbing rtsp and converting to HLS
[19:16:10] <arkanoid> any1: not even in local network with all the required browser-side acknoledgments?
[19:16:27] <kepstin> with webrtc specifically, you need to have a side-channel communication between the browser and the server side to set up connection endpoints and keys, and you're required to implement this yourself.
[19:16:31] <BtbN> Browsers only talk HTTP. WebRTC is compeltely self container
[19:17:34] <another|> SO you want to have a static site with some JS which opens an rtsp stream and mangles in into MSE?
[19:17:35] <kepstin> since the side-channel for webrtc setup is done in javascript in the browser, it can basically only use http and websockets to talk to the server to do the connection setup.
[19:17:54] <BtbN> another|, that's not something you can do, for above mentioned reason

[19:19:27] <BtbN> How do you plan to open rtsp via JS?
[19:19:51] <any1> Your best bet is to get a raspberry pi and build it into a WebRTC/HLS/DASH streaming camera. :)
[19:19:57] <BtbN> You can only talk http and via that websocket. That's it.
[19:20:30] <another|> ah. that might be a limitation. am not too good at js
[19:21:18] <arkanoid> If I got it correctly, if I would setup wasm ffmpeg I could not be able to use it to open "rtsp://myurl/stream" due to browser restrictions, correct?
[19:21:29] <any1> arkanoid: correct
[19:21:30] <BtbN> nope
[19:21:37] <BtbN> it probably can't even open an http stream
[19:22:22] <BtbN> If you desperately need low latency and plain HLS/DASH does not do it, you will need to home cook something like sending fmp4 via a websocket
[19:23:54] <arkanoid> ok but I can't edit ip camera, I'd like it to work with off the shelf ip cameras that generally offer rtsp
[19:24:08] <DeHackEd> also keep in mind that the lower the latency, the less tolerance there is of network outages
[19:24:52] <BtbN> arkanoid, not going to happen
[19:24:59] <arkanoid> sad

[20:07:45] <arkanoid> is ffmpeg the first foss project that landed on another planet?
[20:08:30] <kepstin> arkanoid: almost certainly not, but it's really hard to find out for sure (and there's a lot of other foss software on the rover computer alongside ffmpeg)
[20:09:00] <kepstin> so even if it is first, it's a tie at best :)

[20:10:19] <arkanoid> I am generally a gstreamer user, but after hearing that news I am seriously thinking about switching team. Not sure, just to say thanks
[20:11:16] <kepstin> eh... the projects kind of have different use cases, and gstreamer does internally use ffmpeg for a bunch of codec and container implementations. use whichever fits your project better.

[20:18:53] <Guddu> another|, I came up with this command. Is this the right way to do this?

[20:19:25] <another|> acagastya: `ffmpeg -sample_fmts`
[20:19:59] <another|> oh. sorry. s16 is in there
[20:21:06] <arkanoid> the feature that keeps me attached to gstreamer is the pipeline build syntax. gst-launch feels much more easier and clear than ffmpeg one, even if more verbose
[20:22:07] <acagastya> Oof, thanks, another|!
[20:22:24] <arkanoid> I've build quite complex branching pipelines just using that and a single gstreamer process without writing a line of code. It could be possible with ffmpeg too, but I bet the building pipeline syntax would not be comparable
