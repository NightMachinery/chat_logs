[02:16:22] <lopex[m]> ahorek: cool jcodings job!
[04:38:07] <ahorek[m]> lopex: thanks! I looked at https://github.com/jruby/jcodings/pull/55 again and the original CRuby code seems to be wrong. This table access invalid, but it won't fail on C, see https://godbolt.org/z/KasqY7e4b
[04:38:58] <ahorek[m]> filled https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18651
[04:39:13] <headius> Nice find!
[13:11:44] <lopex[m]> yeah, lots of such cases in joni too

[20:21:23] <headius> these logger errors are weird
[20:21:42] <headius> it seems to still copy an old 1.3.0 logger.rb even though it is supposed to be pulling the 1.5.1 gem
[20:23:33] *** Quits: subbu (~subbu@user/subbu) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:46:38] <headius> hmm well I pushed a .gitignore for the additional logger files but not sure why it is sometimes pulling down 1.3.0 instead of 1.5.1
[20:46:48] <headius> when I did several cleans and rebuilds here I got it to be 1.5.1 and then the tests pass
[22:47:38] <headius> ok the two specs that fail only fail because it is checking Ruby version and not logger version
[22:47:48] <headius> so it is expecting output from an earlier logger than we ship
[22:48:07] <headius> (after incorporating that fix for Windows)
[22:57:14] <headius> not sure about the mri stdlib failures yet
