[00:24:21] <nickoe> Hi, newbie here... If I have an xts object with "discrete" days, and I want to interpolate date in bettween. I see I can use `na.locf`, but I also see that it reqires "dates" to exist with NA in them. How can I add "missing" dates?
[00:24:48] <nickoe> or is there a better way to fill out the data with "sample and hold" style sampling+
[00:25:25] <nickoe> I have a hard time figuring out how to interpolate dates in the xts.
[00:25:40] <nickoe> The matrix has multiple columns

[00:30:13] <Bayes> nickoe you can create a sequence of days
[00:30:21] <Bayes> if that helps
[00:30:56] <nickoe> I am looking at this which appears to be what I want and what you suggest... but
[00:31:17] <Bayes> nickoe https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/vignettes/zoo-faq.pdf #12
[00:31:23] <Bayes> Also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3555526/r-filling-missing-dates-in-a-time-series
[00:31:27] <nickoe> https://dpaste.com/3KGDZSQBL
[00:31:42] <Bayes> tbh last time I used zoo was winter 18
[00:31:49] <Bayes> can't help much
[00:34:13] <rickyrick> nickoe: I think you want seq.Date
[00:35:40] <nickoe> rickyrick yeah, but that also errors for me https://dpaste.com/FGX9FWXTY.txt
[00:36:01] <rickyrick> Is x a zoo object?
[00:36:05] <rickyrick> or xts
[00:36:07] <nickoe> xts
[00:36:20] <nickoe> or not, class on it says zoo :S
[00:36:38] <rickyrick> :^|
[00:36:51] <rickyrick> Are the indices just dates or date-times
[00:37:35] <nickoe> I am not sure I really understand the difference between zoo and xts anyways, the date looks like https://dpaste.com/2BQ97K6NN.txt
[00:37:54] <nickoe> *data
[00:38:02] <confuzius> as a newbie, there is a gem on intro basic R at help.start(). so you can learn subsetting on matrices, data.frames, ..., dates etc
[00:38:02] <rickyrick> Ehh I think you can get it to work by wrapping start(x) and end(x) in as.Date()
[00:39:04] <rickyrick> I also can't remember where complete() comes from
[00:39:17] <nickoe> complete {tidyr}
[00:39:37] <rickyrick> Oh
[00:39:42] <rickyrick> Yeah you don't need that function I think
[00:39:49] <nickoe>  (from the link I probably failed to paste, https://blog.exploratory.io/populating-missing-dates-with-complete-and-fill-functions-in-r-and-exploratory-79f2a321e6b5 )
[00:40:24] <nickoe> I am still new to this wacky language
[00:40:33] <rickyrick> Yeah those instructions are more for data frames than xts/zoo objects
[00:40:50] <nickoe> ah
[00:41:32] <rickyrick> I think Bayes' link is probably the easiest way
[00:41:56] *** Quits: linux_dream (~isaac@37.164.107.136) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[00:42:04] <rickyrick> It does just repeat the last observed value though
[00:42:49] <rickyrick> How you want to fill the missing dates' values are a different question :^)
[00:44:41] <nickoe> yes, I want to just hold the previous samples
[00:44:53] <rickyrick> Yeah that's the ticket then
[00:44:57] <nickoe> so  it appears na.locf is what I want.
[00:45:00] <rickyrick> Yep
[00:45:10] <rickyrick> But na.locf will only work after you introduce the missing dates
[00:45:15] <nickoe> in the stackoverflow link.. It is not happy to create the empty
[00:45:19] <nickoe> yes
[00:45:31] <nickoe> and that is the part I am struggeling with.
[00:46:11] <rickyrick> d'oh
[00:46:36] <rickyrick> Yeah so seq.Date is probably unhappy that the start/end dates aren't dates but POSIX timestamps
[00:46:46] <nickoe> the stackoverflow example only have a one dimensional matrix part
[00:46:48] <rickyrick> So probably just coerce them to date first with as.Date(start(x))
[00:46:56] <nickoe> i.e one column other than the dates
[00:47:16] <rickyrick> I think it should be fine
[00:48:03] <rickyrick> Try empty <- zoo(order.by=seq.Date(as.Date(start(x)), as.Date(end(x)), by="days"))
[00:49:40] <nickoe> That is more like it!  But I also get this warning: Warning message:   In merge.zoo(x, empty) :   Index vectors are of different classes: POSIXct Date
[00:50:06] <nickoe> I mean, the line you proposed appears to work
[00:50:31] <rickyrick> Yeah that makes sense
[00:50:38] <rickyrick> Your x is still indexed by POSIX timestamps
[00:51:15] <rickyrick> Maybe just index(x) <- as.Date(index(x)) first?
[00:51:18] <nickoe> I wonder if it matters.
[00:51:20] <Bayes> such sweet data https://i.imgur.com/gAyZgcB.png
[00:51:24] <Bayes> this is gonna be lotta fun sigh
[00:51:28] <rickyrick> I assume you weren't intending to have x have hour:minute:seconds as well
[00:51:39] <rickyrick> Bayes: c l u s t e r i n g
[00:51:58] <rickyrick> Maybe try integrated PCA
[00:52:10] <nickoe> rickyrick correct, just the dates
[00:52:25] <Bayes> rickyrick on the X?
[00:52:31] <Bayes> divide and conquest
[00:53:32] <rickyrick> nickoe: Yeah cast the x index to dates from the get go
[00:53:41] <rickyrick> That way you can skip the as.Dates inside seq.Date
[00:53:45] <rickyrick> Code looks cleaner that way
[00:53:49] <rickyrick> Bayes: Ya
[00:54:29] <nickoe> rickyrick  "index(x) <- as.Date(index(x))" ?     So it returns the index of x and casts it as as.Date and writes it back to the index values of x?
[00:55:42] <rickyrick> Yep

[01:09:32] <Bayes> nothing too fancy but hard enough to make you forget about the main points pretty quickly
[01:09:41] <rickyrick> mmm functional data
[01:09:49] <Bayes> do you functional, rickyrick?
[01:09:59] <rickyrick> No but I know people who do

[01:10:17] <nickoe> is that in contrast to non-functional data <- garbage?
