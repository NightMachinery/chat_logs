[11:52:35] <Inst> julia is the most beautiful....
[11:52:43] <Inst> wait, Julai community is even smaller than Haskell community?
[11:52:44] <Inst> this is sad

[11:55:50] <ninjin> Basen on what metric Inst?
[11:56:09] <ninjin> s/Basen/Based/
[12:11:10] <mikko> Inst: if you're looking for a bigger community you should go to the official slack (ewww)
[12:11:29] <Inst> Haskell typically has around 800 users
[12:11:47] <mikko> there's also zulip and discord which may or may not be active, this channel is fairly quiet
[12:13:51] <ninjin> Sure Inst, but the majority of the Julia community moved to Slack over half a decade ago. We are what remains after that and also the Freenode travesty.
[12:14:55] <Inst> Much respect, you guys have better odds than Haskell-land
[12:15:15] <Inst> both of us should pythonize, i.e, develop better marketing and pedagogy (but from what I can tell Julia has the second down)
[12:19:02] <Inst> i hope you guys take off, you deserve it
[12:19:15] <Inst> https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F03j_q,%2Fm%2F0j3djl7,%2Fm%2F05z1_
[12:19:38] <Inst> python has already hit peak python, i.e, the number of people who might be interested in python is diminishing because everyone who wants to learn python has learned python
[12:19:56] <Inst> https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F03j_q,%2Fm%2F0j3djl7,%2Fm%2F05z1_,javascript
[12:20:26] <Inst> https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F03j_q,%2Fm%2F0j3djl7
[12:20:55] <Inst> the first one (ignoring the link above the comment) is Haskell, Julia, Python, Javascript, the second is Haskell and Julia
[12:21:08] <Inst> you guys at least are stable, you're used by NASA
[12:21:30] <Inst> Haskell hit a final peak in 2017 and has seen less than half its normal interest since then
[12:27:56] <mikko> i wouldn't read too much into google trends
[12:28:16] <Inst> hope you guys do well
[12:28:30] <Inst> Haskell community is pretty wedded to its model of being "group playground for Comp Sci researchers"
[12:28:34] <mikko> and i don't like to think of it as a popularity contest either, there's plenty of room for all kinds of languages
[12:28:40] <Inst> I'm more of a pragmatist, so I respect what Julia wants to do
[12:28:52] <Inst> you guys have performance way better than Python
[12:29:11] <Inst> I was thinking, fix education, fix marketing, and then the ease of reasoning in functional languages and the sheer concision -> have a shot at Python
[12:29:26] <Inst> since compiled Hask > interpreted Python in performance
[12:29:33] <mikko> python has been catching up though, which is a good thing :)
[12:29:44] <Inst> just get some more C libs, eh? :)
[12:29:55] <Inst> you guys at least understand the lib-gluing model better
[12:31:52] <Inst> but Julia is there, and I don't think Haskell is competitive with Julia in terms of performance, development, and so on
[12:32:40] <mikko> haskell has other things that julia doesn't, like type safety and maturity
[12:33:36] <mikko> and as much as i hate hoogle it's still much better than most of the references you can find for julia libraries...
[12:33:56] <Inst> it's the nice thing about relatively esoteric languages, tbh
[12:34:10] <Inst> we can get together and bitch about how we haven't displaced the majors yet
[12:36:11] <Inst> mikko: ecosystem isn't mature
[12:36:18] <Inst> imo haskell dropped off a cliff once Haskell Platform died
[12:36:19] <Inst> because it died
[12:36:25] <Inst> the community doesn't give Windows support a priority
