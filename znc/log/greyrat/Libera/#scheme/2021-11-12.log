[00:00:36] <mdhughes> And yes, I'm now planning on making a Scheme Gopher server.
[00:00:59] <jcowan> Why isn't it?
[00:01:09] <sham1> GopherS
[00:01:19] <sham1> Or SGopher
[00:01:43] <lagash> mdhughes: what's this about UMinn?
[00:02:01] <jcowan> They owned Gopher, or thought they did.
[00:02:51] <jcowan> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)#Decline
[00:02:58] <mdhughes> They posted that they were going to start charging commercial users. Nobody knew what that meant, and it killed half the servers overnight.
[00:03:20] <sham1> Moronic business practices strike again
[00:03:50] <lagash> Ah yes, I forgot about that!
[00:04:31] <jcowan> In general, when universities pretend they are businesses (or vice versa), Bad Things.
[00:08:12] <Zipheir> mdhughes: https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/gopher  More or less all you need, although it wants a CHICKEN 5 port.
[00:09:07] <Zipheir> I should dust off my Scheme gopherd.
[00:09:56] <mdhughes> I have a generic network server, I'll just extend that. Right now it does a sort of command line for requesting text files.
[00:10:04] <Zipheir> Universities *are* businesses.
[00:11:24] <sham1> Depends on where you are
[00:11:40] <jcowan> I'm certainly not against Gopher, but I see the issues mentioned in the Gemini FAQ as important: communicating charsets and media types clearly, machine-understandable success/failure, redirects, and references out of Gemini space.  I consider transmission security a lesser concern, though I know for many it is the most important issue.
[00:11:45] <Zipheir> Yes, sorry.  US universities certainly are.
[00:12:36] <sham1> Having TLS is still a nice thing, although I don't know if I'd mandate it if I were to make a protocol like Gemeni
[00:12:38] <mdhughes> Depends on the state & university, tho.
[00:13:37] <mdhughes> In theory, I like security. In practice, it's not necessary for a document tree.
[00:13:42] <jcowan> With a complex set of constraints.  Maximizing customers looks good, but leads to failure in the longer range as the degree becomes worthless.
[00:13:51] <Zipheir> I'd argue that they have to win funding and students, so there is a product being sold: education, or in a sense the credentials that pass for it.
[00:14:21] <mdhughes> There's very little PII sent to a Gopher server, but there's times when you do want privacy. Might figure out a simpler SSL tunnel.
[00:16:02] <Zipheir> relayd on the BSDs, stunnel on Linux, etc.
[00:18:26] <sham1> I'd still say that having some kind of a "gophers"-port which just does Gopher over TLS or whatever would still be useful even if one could usually argue that just for a document tree it mightn't be that significant and that one could use some TLS tunneling or SSH tunnels
[00:20:33] <sham1> Of course, Gopher wouldn't be the protocol to do bank stuff under, but still
[00:20:45] <jcowan> Joseph Wright (self-taught Professor of Comparative Philology) and Tolkien:  'What do you take Oxford for, lad?' 'A university, a place of learning.' 'Nay, lad, it's a factory! And what's it making? I'll tell you. It's making *fees*. Get that in your head, and you'll begin to understand what goes on.'
[00:22:14] <jcowan> Actually it should be perfectly good for banking given client certs.  You create a cert, send its hash to the bank, and tell them "This is my signature".
[00:22:27] <Zipheir> Good quote. :)
[00:22:43] <Franciman> do y'all use emacs to edit your sheme?
[00:22:54] <Franciman> scheme*
[00:23:07] <jcowan> I use `ex`, but I am a troglodyte: don't mind me.
[00:24:14] <jcowan> Almost certainly most people use emacs, with a minority using vi(m).  If there are constituencies using other editors, we don't hear from them much.
[00:24:14] <Zipheir> I tend to use sam or its vi crossbreed, vis.  But I try not to be religious about text editors.
[00:24:31] * jcowan investigates vis
[00:24:33] <Franciman> jcowan: ex is the predecessor to vi?
[00:24:46] <sham1> Yes
[00:24:47] <Franciman> I use kakoune
[00:24:54] <Franciman> and parinfer-rust
[00:25:04] <jcowan> It's also the mode you get to if you type "gQ".
[00:25:05] <Franciman> i find the experience pleasing
[00:25:09] <sham1> I usually use Emacs but I also do use vim and sometimes vis, because I need to see if the fedora package has bugs
[00:25:13] <Zipheir> jcowan: https://github.com/martanne/vis
[00:25:56] <Zipheir> Like most editors, it's too complicated and too messy.
[00:26:08] <Franciman> ahah
[00:26:11] <jcowan> https://www.linuxlinks.com/vis-vi-like-editor-plan-9-structural-regular-expressions/
[00:26:25] <jcowan> Awesomesauce.
[00:26:37] <Franciman> vis is really nice yeah
[00:26:38] <sham1> Vis is nice and configured in Lua which also is neat. And of course the whole structural regex thing also rocks
[00:26:42] <Franciman> kak has structural regexes too
[00:27:34] <jcowan> I found a bunch of things I'd like to see in `sam -d` but got no traction for:  https://github.com/deadpixi/sam/issues/96
[00:28:58] <Zipheir> I started on a vis variant with chibi-scheme replacing Lua, but I haven't gotten back to it.  It's a much bigger job than I initially thought.
[00:29:34] <Franciman> nice
[00:29:59] <mdhughes> I use Vim or BBEdit, have spent some time on Sublime Text and Atom, but those are too heavy for me.
[00:30:07] <sham1> guile could probably work because of its C interop, although that's just me being ignorant about how embedding chibi works
[00:30:17] <jcowan> Conversely https://github.com/johnwcowan/exx/blob/master/exx/exx-features.txt is a design for a variant of ex (without vi) with sammy stuff in it
[00:30:55] <jcowan> One of foof's goals was for Chibi to do Lua and bash as well as Scheme
[00:30:56] <mdhughes> All you actually need is some way to match parens, and a way to run text thru scripts (shell or any language).
[00:30:57] <Zipheir> jcowan: Nice.
[00:31:15] <sham1> And basically every text editor beyond ed can do both
[00:31:31] <jcowan> Matching parens is the main reason I drop into vi mode at all.
[00:31:32] <sham1> Although some text editors are better than others for this, since they have structural editing
[00:31:45] <mdhughes> "live scripting" in an editor isn't that useful. Syntax should be visible without coloring, but most editors can do colors as well.
[00:32:11] * jcowan haaates colored text, he does.
[00:32:16] <mdhughes> I just match parens, break a line, grab a group of lines to refactor it.
[00:32:41] <jcowan> "Black text on a white background, as God and Gutenberg intended."
[00:33:02] <sham1> I hope that the "white background" is eink, because otherwise it burns
[00:33:21] <jcowan> It doesn't have to be #FFFFFF, you know.
[00:33:24] <sham1> Because most screens aren't optimized well enough for that and will glow like an approximation of the Sun at close range
[00:33:45] <wasamasa> jcowan: why does that list surgery API look like anime titles
[00:34:02] <sham1> I read that wrong, damn it
[00:34:34] <mdhughes> I like Hackerman colors: https://github.com/mr-ubik/hackerman-contrib
[00:35:00] <jcowan> Feh.

[16:30:36] <amazigh> OS threads are complicated topic. Is that POSIX threads like Chez and Guile? is that cooperative threads like loko and chicken?
[16:30:50] *** Quits: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[16:31:14] <amazigh> Also, even without POSIX threads, it is possible to use SMP, such as Gambit used to do (SMP is still behind a flag)
[16:31:23] <amazigh> Does CPython support POSIX threads?
[16:31:45] <amazigh> Yes according to the documentation; even I consider their POSIX threads support useless;
[16:31:55] <amazigh> because of the global interpreter lock;
[16:32:11] <rgherdt_> OS (native) threads are Chez and Guile ones
[16:34:01] <rgherdt_> an alternative way would be to group categories, like this guy does: https://bit.ly/3C7V95V
[16:34:14] <amazigh> Regarding that topic, I still think coop-spawn to be an idea worth purusing (that is a higher level interface to make use of SMP (symmetric multipleprocessing))
[16:34:22] <amazigh> ref to coop-spawn: https://github.com/pre-srfi/coop#coop-spawn-priority-thunk-positive-procedure
[16:36:03] <amazigh> re the bit.ly grouped flags, that is great; but the code doesn't support grouping; and I do not want to implement it as of yet;

[16:38:02] <amazigh> adding both coop threads (gambit, chicken, ruse/arew, guile with fibers); and OS threads (chez, guile, gambit); I will think about it; the limit for ~10 flags is not arbitrary, I want to flags to be all visible on my desktop in the hero screen
[16:39:03] <amazigh> btw, I will drop arew from the comparator; I plan to rename all my ruse/arew project to chez-scheme; because that way it will look less fragmented.
[16:39:21] <amazigh> And I am willing to merge akku support in any projet;
[16:40:26] <amazigh> re threads, there is also the discussion about parameters; last time I checked, it seems implementations disagree on how parameters should be handled (and in the pre-srfi coop; that is unspecified)
[16:40:50] <amazigh> My take on it; is that coop-spawn should "copy" the paremeters to thunk;
[16:41:14] <amazigh> the thunk may run in a dedicated cpu core hence OS thread.
[16:41:52] <amazigh> OS thread that may be just after a fork; that is also unspecified (up to the implementer) in coop
[16:42:13] <wasamasa> it would be great if scheme.rs had a split between r7rs-small and the rest with regards to documentation
[16:42:21] <wasamasa> so that you could see the mandatory and optional parts

[16:42:42] <amazigh> I will add that. tx.

[16:56:07] <amazigh> yes; but in coop; you can (call/cc proc) then coop-spawn; in which case the parameters travel with the continuation; unlike (I think) current behavior where the parameters are those in place when the OS thread was created.
