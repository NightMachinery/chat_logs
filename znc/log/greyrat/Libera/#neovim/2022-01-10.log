[00:44:34] <pun> kraftwerk28: I got some wierd stuff from tsserver earlier when it was running in tandem with denols not sure how to replicate tho. 
[00:44:49] <mjlbach[m]> pun: you'd have to wrap vim.notify to filter the error message

[00:45:12] <pun> mjlbach[m]: I see thank you I'll look into it.
[00:45:25] <kraftwerk28> pun, about your error: you need to set up `root_pattern` for your server properly. I.e. https://github.com/kraftwerk28/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/lsp_servers.lua#L9-L15
[00:45:57] <kraftwerk28> mjlbach[m], thank you
[00:46:39] <pun> kraftwerk28: thank you kraftwerk28 but this is intentional. I'm trying to setup nvim so that for specific files it runs only one lsp server and ignores the errors for others ( which will fail because they don't have any root_pattern whatsoever )

[12:32:06] <SaurabhPradhan[m> hi 
[12:32:58] <SaurabhPradhan[m> How do I right align diagnostic virtual text?
[12:34:56] <dngray[m]> anyone else here use the NeoVim flatpak?
[12:35:29] <dngray[m]> i'm trying to use it with https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim, but of course that requires nodejs
[12:35:47] <dngray[m]> which i overlayed via rpm-ostree
[12:36:12] <dngray[m]> it seems that i can use nodejs with the Flatpak as i see: 
[12:36:14] <dngray[m]> nvim-wrapper-wrapper: Setting up NPM packages
[12:36:17] <dngray[m]> when loading it
[12:36:32] <dngray[m]> but yeah TLDR i'm getting this error
[12:36:33] <dngray[m]> > [coc.nvim] "node" is not executable, checkout https://nodejs.org/en/download/

[17:17:55] <andreypopp[m]> Has anyone seen/working on a neovim REPL plugin which uses tree sitter so 1. it can automatically select top level statements w/o explicitly selecting them and 2. tracks dependencies between statements so only relevant part can be recomputed.

[17:25:29] <taw10> andreypopp[m]: The first part is planned in Conjure (https://github.com/Olical/conjure/).  The second part... is it even possible in general?
[17:26:19] <vigoux[m]> Second part needs a complete compiler ?
[17:26:57] <vigoux[m]> But something like a cache could be done I think
[17:27:14] <vigoux[m]> And you recompute the values of the leafs of each expressions...
[17:28:10] <andreypopp[m]> the second part requires scoping analysis which could probably be done using tree sitter
[17:28:42] <vigoux[m]> It should be doable
[17:29:55] <andreypopp[m]> Another question — what's the roadmap regarding virt_lines? I'm using it in nvim-bqn but there are some rough edges, especially around scrolling.

[20:46:17] <LeoNerd> That's not what I want
[20:46:28] <LeoNerd> I am tired of 2 decades of desktop programs believing that Ctrl-W is "close window"
[20:46:36] <kraftwerk28> LeoNerd, terminals don't distinguish between ctrl+backspace and ctrl+shift+backspace (you can check it w/ `showkey -a`)
[20:46:42] <LeoNerd> I have long since lost the energy to fight that
[20:46:43] <zeraphel> a way to distinguish between <c-h> and <c-c-h> so to speak?
[20:46:51] <LeoNerd> Er.. nonsense. my termianl does it. nvim does it just fine
[20:46:59] <LeoNerd> My question is purely 100% "what do I put on the RHS of the map"
[20:47:12] <LeoNerd> I can map *from* Ctrl-Backspace and Ctrl-Shift-Backspace just fine
[20:47:21] <LeoNerd> I already have it. It just doesn't -quite- do the right thing to delete a word
[20:48:14] <zeraphel> well,  <c-w> in RHS will delete <cword>,  for <cWORD> i'd guess <c-o>diW
[20:48:14] <LeoNerd> map <C-BS>  "_db      inoremap <C-BS> ^O"_db    almost works
[20:48:33] <LeoNerd> The problem is sometimes because it's a mapping, it behaves weirdly when I'm in the middle of doing Something Else
[20:48:50] <LeoNerd> E,g. if I type it during the middle of a hidden fold section, it deletes far too much
[20:49:12] <LeoNerd> Also the Ctrl-O hackery is beginning to annoy me
[20:49:19] <kraftwerk28> Which terminal are you using?
[20:49:26] <LeoNerd> I kindof hate having to write every map twice
[20:49:45] <LeoNerd> pangoterm but that's not important. Again the question isn't about the keys in the terminal - nvim can recognise what I have typed just fine
[20:49:52] <LeoNerd> Again: my question is what do I put on the RHS of the map
[20:50:08] <LeoNerd> :map <C-BS> SOMETHING HERE   will already be recognised just fine
[20:50:20] <LeoNerd> I want to know what to put instead of `SOMETHING HERE`
[20:50:33] <marcelarie[m]> <C-w> ?
[20:50:48] <LeoNerd> OK so that'll do a word. But how to do a WORD ?

[20:51:52] <LeoNerd> but I want that to act as one WORD for the purposes of Ctrl-Shift-BS
[20:52:03] <LeoNerd> Which suggests I need something other than <C-w> to map it to
[20:52:40] <LeoNerd> E.g. I could map it to  "_dB  which sortof but doesn't quite work
[20:53:13] <LeoNerd> If I type  this-is-four-words  and leave the cursor just after the s of "words", then Ctrl-O"_dB  will delete all of them back to the t, but leaves the 's' of 'words' still in place
[20:53:48] <LeoNerd> I so far haven't found a thing I can map to, which will delete everything from the 't' of this to the 's' of words, inclusive
[20:54:15] *** Joins: ublx (~ublx@user/ublx)
[20:54:32] <zeraphel> LeoNerd: diW instead of dB will handle that scenario.
[20:54:50] <LeoNerd> Ah, but then that will delete too much in other situations
[20:55:04] <LeoNerd> The point of Backspace or Del are that they delete -from the cursor- in one direction only
[20:55:40] <LeoNerd> E.g. if I were to type  this-is-four-words  then move the cursor to the 3rd hyphen and diW  then I'd also lose the word "words". whereas C-S-Backspace is supposed to delete only backwards, leaving that alone
[20:55:46] *** Joins: ys (~ys@user/ys)
[20:55:50] <zeraphel> alright, then the problem is that dB skips the one character,  How about <c-o>vBd

[20:56:29] <marcelarie[m]> I tried vBd and it works I think

[20:59:04] <zeraphel> LeoNerd: so its both EOL behaviour and a partial <cWORD> match you want to get rid of
[20:59:28] <LeoNerd> Zer?
[20:59:33] <LeoNerd> zeraphel: ?
[21:00:24] <LeoNerd> sunjonSenghanBri: that breaks the other case
[21:00:34] <LeoNerd> There doesn't seem to be a thing that works in both scenarios.. I can't quite believe this should be this hard
[21:01:06] <LeoNerd> I simply want the behaviour "delete from the start of where iW would go, up to the cursor"
[21:02:55] <marcelarie[m]> did you try `diW` ?
[21:03:23] <LeoNerd> Did you? That deletes the entire thing, regardless of where the cursor is
[21:03:38] <LeoNerd> Golden rule: _NEVER_ delete any character after the cursor, in a <...-Backspace> mapping
[21:04:00] <zeraphel> LeoNerd: i think i have an idea,  working on something
[21:04:02] <LeoNerd> The whole point is that <...-Backspace> mappings must delete only backwards; and <...-Del> mappings must delete only forwards
[21:04:22] <zeraphel> getline -> stridx expand cword - col('.')
[21:04:30] <LeoNerd> this-is-four-words|  must become empty;   this-is-four-|words  must become  words
[21:04:49] <zeraphel> should be doable in a single <expr> mapping expression
[21:05:11] <marcelarie[m]> but vBd does that right?
[21:05:17] <LeoNerd> vBd does not
[21:05:35] <LeoNerd> Try it - you'll find you lose the 'w' of 'words'
[21:05:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> `<C-o>vBohd` produces https://streamable.com/iy6bta for me
[21:06:06] <LeoNerd> sunjonSenghanBri: and I've already said, that breaks in the other scenario
[21:06:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm not sure what the other case it breaks is
[21:06:09] <LeoNerd> There are _TWO_ scariouis here
[21:07:00] <LeoNerd> zeraphel: I guess an <expr> mapping that asks nvim to please calculate where the beginning of WORD would be and then asks it to delete from there to the cursor, .... might work?
[21:07:24] <LeoNerd> I could half-imagine it would get confused about byte/char/column conversions if the line began with a Tab or otherwise contained non-plain-ASCII values though
[21:08:26] <marcelarie[m]> I'm trying to get it, with vBd
[21:08:26] <marcelarie[m]> this-is-four-words
[21:08:27] <marcelarie[m]>                    ^ cursor here 
[21:08:27] <marcelarie[m]> I get words
[21:08:27] <zeraphel> one problem at a time,  i think there are some functions to calculate those even in vim if it ever becomes a prob
[21:08:37] <marcelarie[m]> thats not what you want 
[21:09:12] <marcelarie[m]> * you want *?
[21:09:45] <LeoNerd> marcelarie[m]: What else was on the line? The cursor can't "be there" because there isn't anything else. If the line ends "words" then after the Ctrl-O the cursor has to sit atop the s of "words"

[21:11:27] <marcelarie[m]> hahaa thanks 
[21:11:44] <LeoNerd> See what I mean though? This shouldn't be hard - but yet it is
[21:12:51] <LeoNerd> All of this really has only come about because I am tired of closing windows because I pressed Ctrl-W hoping to "delete back a word". So I've reluctantly had to force myself to never press Ctrl-W any more, and thus instead make every program use Ctrl-Backspace to do that instead
[21:13:03] <LeoNerd> Most of the time it's actually not too hard
[21:14:09] <LeoNerd> There's only actually two programs I use in which Ctrl-Backspace isn't already natively delete-back-word. bash (i.e. readline), and nvim. readline is easy enough to fix; "\e[127;5u": backward-kill-word
[21:14:13] <LeoNerd> in .inputrc
[21:14:29] <LeoNerd> It's weird that vim is *so much harder* to fix
[21:14:32] <zeraphel> well my idea was a bust,  <cWORD> does not expand properly because the cursor is not located where it appears to be in insert mode /o\
[21:14:41] <LeoNerd> Mhmm.. ;)
[21:15:21] <LeoNerd> Making it work in all three positions (middle-of-WORD, end-of-WORD within a line, end-of-WORD at end of line), in both normal and insert mode, is really tough. As I said I haven't found a solution yet

[21:33:48] <LeoNerd> I begin to wonder if vim needs half-objects.. we have the "a" and the "inner" objects; perhaps we also need a way to express "from the start of that object to the cursor", or likewise for the second half
[21:34:20] <kaddkaka[m]> In what way does the treesitter plugin mess with `filetype`? I noticed recently that some files that previously got detected as `mason` files now have filetype set to `glsl`, this goes back to `mason` when I dont load the plugin `nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter`
[21:34:26] <LeoNerd> Or maybe a better mapping system. Or.. just lots of stuff
[21:34:55] <zeraphel> most of them can be prefixed with 'g',  i.e. E / gE, etc..  its just that they're meant to be used from normal mode imo >_>
[21:35:21] <LeoNerd> It suggests that vim isn't very orthogonal. it's not good Lego
[21:35:54] <LeoNerd> Vim clearly has a brick of "find the extent of a WORD". and it has a brick "delete from the beginning of some object to the cursor". It just doesn't offer me a way to stick those two particular bricks together

[21:38:50] * zeraphel is royally pissed off that <cword> expansion is messed up in insert mode
[21:39:06] <LeoNerd> I'm royally pissed by a whole lot more than that. vim's very design is the wrong shape
[21:40:00] <LeoNerd> How it works - in regular vim or nvim - is that vim *natively* recognises a huge bunch of things like "the a key" or j or whatever... loads of them. If you want more keyboard actions, you do it by :map 'ing; by telling vim that if you pressed some key, to pretend that instead you had pressed some different keys
[21:40:31] <LeoNerd> Whereas almost any other terminal-based program ends up having "key bindings", not a remap engine.. the idea that there are native actions that can just "be done", and those actions can get bound to keys
[21:40:33] <zeraphel> To be honest,  this is pretty trivial to implement if you approach it from the perspective of writing a plugin rather than a single mapping
[21:40:35] *** GabrielLPereira[ is now known as Vem[m]
[21:41:21] <LeoNerd> And so in that hypothetical model, vim wouldn't have a native understanding of Ctrl-W, but instead it would have some named action (delete-back-word for want of a better name), that could be _bound to_ the Ctrl-W key. Or any other key.
[21:41:37] *** Joins: rsaavedra (~rodrigo@user/rsaavedra)
[21:42:04] <LeoNerd> But then maybe delete-back-word itself is actually a little composite expression, formed from simpler parts, like "find beginning of word", "cursor pos", and "delete between these two points"
[21:42:37] <LeoNerd> A much more orthogonal Lego-brick-style system, in which whenever you add a single new brick (e.g. find beginning of WORD), you suddenly have the ability to freely combine it with any of the existing bricks in lots of new powerful ways
[21:42:54] <kaddkaka[m]> Isnt it strange that `e` moves to character that is deleted by `de`, while `w` moves to a character that is NOT deleted by `dw`?

[21:44:56] <zeraphel> kaddkaka[m]: how is that weird?  de deletes to the end of <cword>,  dw deletes remainder of <cword> plus trailing space
[21:45:12] <tar_xvf> the difference between de and dw makes a lot of sense in my opinion
[21:45:14] <LeoNerd> It's fundamentally not really fixable in any project that aims at full compatibility with vim; because fixing it requires changing stuff
[21:45:28] <LeoNerd> A new editor "inspired a bit like nvim" could do it, but it would have to start again
[21:45:54] <kaddkaka[m]> LeoNerd: have you looked at kakoune?
[21:45:54] <mjlbach[m]> there are about a billion of those
[21:45:56] <tar_xvf> also, why would you use de
[21:46:22] <tar_xvf> i always just used dw, made more sense intuitively, especially when deleting text and it deletes the word and the space after
[21:46:25] <kaddkaka[m]> tar_xvf: is there any reason to avoid `de`?
[21:46:35] <tar_xvf> no, of course
[21:46:35] <LeoNerd> kaddkaka[m]: hadn't heard of it before, shall take a look
[21:46:51] <tar_xvf> i actually had never used de before
[21:46:53] <zeraphel> There's also Kate.. recieved a new update few weeks back
[21:48:15] <kaddkaka[m]> tar_xvf: sometimes you I just want to remove the second half of a word. Perhaps the `de`/`dw` difference make logical sense, I will have to think about it. It certainly is what I usually want so I'm not really complaining :)
[21:48:31] <kaddkaka[m]> s/you I/I
[21:48:55] <tar_xvf> interesting, i just tested it out and it appears that both dw and de act the same if there is not whitespace after the word but it's another character like a period, but if you have a word with whitespace after, dw deletes the whitespace after and de doesn't
[21:48:58] <tar_xvf> neat

[21:57:22] <kaddkaka[m]> tar_xvf: There is alsu `dE` and `dW` which considers more character as part of a word. See `:h word`
[21:58:02] <tar_xvf> kaddkaka[m]: ah yes, those go to whitespace only instead of other non-word characters
[21:58:24] <kaddkaka[m]> yes
[22:01:42] <kaddkaka[m]> oooh `e` is an inclusive motion, and `w` is an exclusive motion. That's why de/dw differs I guess.

[22:39:27] <kaddkaka[m]> In vim, I can output the filetype of a file to the terminal with this command `TERM=dumb vim -e banana -c"set ft?" -cq -u NORC` The similar command for nvim outputs nothing. Is that expected?
[22:39:27] <kaddkaka[m]> I read `:h TERM`, but I'm not sure how to interpret it or if nvim expects something else in the environment variable compared to vim.

[23:06:48] <Bowuigi[m]> Also, `nvim -u NORC +'echo ":filetype =" &ft " +q [file] | col -b | cut -d ':' -f2` would make it work for non-dumb terminals
[23:07:06] <kaddkaka[m]> I found something interesting also, if I sett cmdheight, I do get output with the same command as vim:
[23:07:06] <kaddkaka[m]> `TERM=dumb nvim -e base/components/l1/l1.comp -c"set cmdheight=2" -c"set ft?" -cq -u NORC` outputs
[23:07:09] <Bowuigi[m]> * &ft ":" +q
[23:07:23] <kaddkaka[m]>   filetype=mason
[23:07:42] <kaddkaka[m]> but with cmdheight=1 i get no output
[23:07:58] <Bowuigi[m]> You will need to clear the escape secuences and stuff
[23:08:04] <Bowuigi[m]> Which is what I did on my versions
[23:08:24] <Bowuigi[m]> * &ft ":"' +q
[23:09:31] <kaddkaka[m]> Bowuigi: yeah my output looks like this `24;1H34h?25h?25l1122?qm34h?25h?1l?1049l23;0t?2004l?1004l34h?25hq1122 q` is that actually useful?
[23:09:57] <Bowuigi[m]> Nope lol
