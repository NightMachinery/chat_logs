[02:52:44] <Hello71> and what about the file size and quality
[02:57:53] <hyrcanus> have not compared
[02:58:38] <hyrcanus> does increasing pools lead to suboptimal encoding Hello71 ?
[02:59:14] <Hello71> dunno about x265 specifically but in general if you chop frame into more pieces it will not be able to do as much intra-frame compression
[02:59:16] <BtbN> generally, multithreaded encoding does have a quality impact
[02:59:28] <BtbN> How bad it is varies a lot
[02:59:46] <BtbN> But it's not bad enough to have everyone slowly encode along on a single core at least
[03:00:00] <Hello71> plus most encoders have "funny behavior" related to these types of parameters, e.g. x264/x265 file size varies wildly by speed preset
[03:00:33] <BtbN> They're not speed presets.
[03:00:45] <Hello71> s/speed//
[03:00:46] <BtbN> They're presets in the literal sense, setting default values to tons of little knobs
[03:01:00] <BtbN> Just broadly laid out by processing intensity
[03:05:29] <hyrcanus> i'm using -preset fast for libx265, crf, adding -tune fastdecode so my old arm device can playback in cpu
[03:05:51] <hyrcanus> it's still a huge win over h264
[03:08:15] <hyrcanus> thanks for the info Hello71 i'll do some comparisons to see if i'm satisfied with results
[03:09:20] <hyrcanus> if they're unsatisfactory i might just script up a sticher to sequentially encode 4 parts of a video

[11:43:50] <roxlu> When I allocate a `AVFrame` and then receive a frame; the documentation says that a call to `avcodec_receive_frame()` will always call `av_frame_unref()` which unreferences the buffers and resets the frame fields. Does that mean that the internal buffer refs get free'd when ref-count gets to 0?
[11:46:10] <durandal_1707> iirc no
[11:48:13] <roxlu> thanks, that was my understanding too... it's not what I would have expected though.. normally when ref-counted objects get to 0 they are cleaned up.
[11:48:56] <roxlu> ... but I also just read that a `AVFrame` is actually just a "view" to the buffers and that the allocations are managed by the codec implementation (which makes sense ofc)
[11:52:35] <roxlu> If a codec manages the actuall frame data (buffers), does a call to `av_frame_copy()` then make a copy of those (by codec managed memory) buffers?
[12:02:42] <durandal_1707> iirc, copy copies content
[12:02:54] <durandal_1707> there is also av_frame_cloen

[19:38:45] <DRmadness> BUT the colors are oversaturated and overexposed.
[19:39:44] <DRmadness> So I was looking for some other way to get ir converted to HDR but obtaining a more pleasant result.
[19:41:06] <DRmadness> filtering with eq doesn't seem to achieve good results
[19:41:31] <DRmadness> So maybe some tonemapping... but when I try that I get a "no path between colorspaces"
[19:46:57] <JEEB> the zscale filter should let you convert the SDR to PQ transfer etc, but you also need to boost the graphics white point from SDR's 100 nits to 203 nits
[19:47:26] <JEEB> because of course SDR graphics white and HDR graphics white are not the same thing ;)
[19:48:12] <DRmadness> Can you please post a simple command example for doing this,JEEB?
[19:48:55] <JEEB> how much is your input tagged?
[19:49:02] <JEEB> like if you ffprobe -v verbose it
[19:49:15] <JEEB> do you get the primaries/matrix/transfer found
[19:49:36] <JEEB> also for the record, I have no idea how to map 100 nits to 203 nits :P
[19:49:44] <JEEB> with libavfilter that is
[19:49:58] <JEEB> probably some lut would be able to do it, but it's not implemented to my knowledge anywhere
[19:50:22] <JEEB> I mean, as a specific "please do this" sort of thing
[19:50:26] <DRmadness> I have to work with tagged and untagged, but all of them are alike, so they are bt709
[19:51:05] <JEEB> why I ask is because zimg/zscale wants to know, so if you have input actually tagged then you don't need to specifically flag the input in zscale
[19:51:39] <JEEB> also for the record, if you have a recent enough FFmpeg, the color primaries, transfer, matrix, range and chroma location should get set automagically in x265
[19:52:05] <JEEB> this or newer http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=commit;h=9b2281a4a383677ded522e603514789cc22498fa
[19:52:22] <DRmadness> I know, though I usualy have it added anyway for zscale just in case one of the files lacks any tag
[19:52:36] <JEEB> yeh
[19:53:04] <JEEB> so just set output transfer to pq (whatever zimg/zscale's name for it was), and set input to BT.1886
[19:53:15] <JEEB> or BT.709 (which ends up being BT.1886)
[19:53:51] <JEEB> then primaries and matrix to bt2020 / bt2020-ncl
[19:54:02] <JEEB> whatever the proper values for those are in zscale :)
[19:54:09] <JEEB> and for input bt.709/bt.709 most likely?
[19:54:19] <DRmadness> I already do that, I think. Have you read my command example above?
[19:54:31] <JEEB> yes, you just have -vf format=yuv420p10le
[19:54:32] <DRmadness> That comand converts an SDR file to HDR.
[19:54:51] <JEEB> no it does not :D
[19:54:58] <JEEB> you set various random options to x265
[19:55:14] <JEEB> and set the output format for the filter chain to be yuv420p10le
[19:55:30] <JEEB> that does not change *any* color related values
[19:55:53] <JEEB> it will just get expanded if it's <10bit or dithered down if it's >10bit
[19:57:34] <DRmadness> It just convert to an HDR10 compatible format when setting those parameters for the encoder, and it needs that vf yuv420p10le for working
[19:57:58] <JEEB> those x265 parameters do not convert anything
[19:58:02] <JEEB> it sets the metadata, yes
[19:58:09] <JEEB> but it does not affect the chain. at all.
[19:58:21] <DRmadness> Values are not random, DCI-P3 display, Dolby mastering monitor luminance values
[19:58:27] <JEEB> so if you think you posted a command that converts SDR to HDR, that is not the case
[19:58:45] <JEEB> I know MaxFALL and mastering display metadata
[19:58:59] <DRmadness> Yes, that's what I intended to mean, it doesn't convert, it sets metadata so I can join that file to the HDR one.
[19:59:23] <JEEB> then your input is no longer BT.709/BT.1886 is it?
[19:59:25] <DRmadness> No, it is not converting, I just shortened and did it badly.
[20:00:02] <JEEB> anyways, the command you actually posted more or less passthroughs
[20:00:07] <DRmadness> After that command, it's tagged as bt2020 and hdr-opt=1
[20:00:09] <JEEB> it just sets some values on the output encoder
[20:00:29] <JEEB> so it only works for already content that matches those values
[20:00:51] <DRmadness> That's why I'm getting overexposed/oversaturated result.
[20:01:24] <DRmadness> But I don't know a better way to do it, so that's whi I'm here O:3
[20:02:05] <JEEB> also the only reason I started commenting on the command line since you noted > I already do that, I think. Have you read my command example above?
[20:02:18] <JEEB> to which I then started saying that no, that most definitely does not do what you were asking about
[20:02:21] <JEEB> :P
[20:03:24] <DRmadness> Of course ir doen't do what I'm asking. I meant it worked... because it let me join videos, but *it doesn't work* if I pretend to convert color values to HDR space
[20:03:35] <DRmadness> convert, translate, whatever
[20:04:47] <JEEB> ok, great. so you are just wording yourself in a weird way and not actually thinking that it actually works. great
[20:04:48] <DRmadness> I don't even need the result to look really spot on, only not as awful as is now.
[20:06:10] <JEEB> personally I would not set various values if they are already set in the input file, as that leads to usually copypasta command lines without people thinking what they set
[20:06:17] <JEEB> but yea, let me whip something up quickly
[20:06:42] <JEEB> I expect that your input is YCbCr, BT.709 (matrix, primaries, transfer (which is actually BT.1886)
[20:06:49] <DRmadness> yes
[20:07:02] *** jarainf- is now known as jarainf
[20:07:28] <JEEB> and do note that I recommend utilizing ffprobe with the json output or whatever to first check if the input has any flagging, and in that case only apply applicable values that are required in zscale
[20:07:32] <DRmadness> I do understand the copypaste problem. I am aware of the nature of this HDR beast.
[20:08:52] <DRmadness> OK, understood.
[20:10:12] <JEEB> -vf "zscale=min=bt709:pin=bt709:tin=bt709:m=bt2020nc:p=bt2020:t=smpte2084,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p10"
[20:10:19] <JEEB> I /think/ that should be it
[20:10:22] <JEEB> oh, chroma location
[20:12:16] <DRmadness> I've tried that before, result is error code 3074: no path between colorspaces
[20:12:18] <JEEB> -vf "zscale=min=bt709:pin=bt709:tin=bt709:cin=left:m=bt2020nc:p=bt2020:t=smpte2084:c=topleft,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p10"
[20:12:21] <JEEB> orly
[20:12:43] <JEEB> lemme test, I think it only does that if not all values are explicitly set
[20:13:07] <DRmadness> I'll try again, too.
[20:13:38] <JEEB> worked ofr me
[20:13:41] <JEEB> lemme check the result
[20:14:44] <JEEB> looks Good Enough
[20:15:18] <JEEB> mostly clearly darker because of the SDR/HDR graphics white case
[20:15:22] <DRmadness> I am reviewing my own filterchain, something was not right there. yours do work.
[20:16:00] <JEEB> as long as matrix,primaries,transfer are set for both in and out it should I think work.
[20:16:22] <JEEB> the minimum with f.ex. RGB->YCbCr is just setting matrix where it does no transfer conversion
[20:17:11] <DRmadness> I did exactly that. I'll need to re-test and simplify the chain to see where I introduced the problem.
[20:17:11] <JEEB> also noticed that it seems to not set chroma location if I am seeing correctly. since everything else got set automagically for x265, but chroma location is set to left still, even though c=topleft
[20:17:51] <JEEB> I plugged the pipes so I like not having to set encoder options for another time if the input AVFrame already contains the info :P
[20:18:06] <DRmadness> chromalocation is something that gets overlooked too often, and as not even players seem to look at it, I guess it would cause no harm either way.
[20:18:21] <JEEB> yea I implemented it in the x264 and x265 wrappers lately
[20:19:12] <JEEB> so f.ex. if you take in a clip that has chroma location actaully set and the AVFrame received from filter chain (you always have it even if you do no real filtering) has it set -> it gets set for the encoder
[20:19:29] <DRmadness> I tendo to be ultra-verbose so I don't get lost amid the chaos. That causes.. chaos, ironicaly :')
[20:20:00] <JEEB> that's kind of why I made input AVFrame map to output encoder parameters :)

[20:22:38] <JEEB> DRmadness: and nobody implements this because it's not strictly part of color space conversions (and you need to know whether your inputs and outputs are SDR or HDR xD

[20:33:23] <JEEB> > Stream #0:0(und): Video: hevc, 1 reference frame (hev1 / 0x31766568), yuv420p10le(bt2020nc/bt2020/smpte2084, progressive, left)
[20:33:40] <JEEB> that's what I got automagically
[20:33:48] <JEEB> anyways, av_log time

[20:34:56] <DRmadness> I've had so many videos that should be tagged properly but weren't that I've gone nuts micromanaging every bit. It seems ffmpeg doesn't like it X)
[20:35:12] <JEEB> but without the conversion in the middle if I utilize f.ex. an input with topleft it gets passed, so the passing does work
[20:35:17] <JEEB> thus debugging the filter it is

[20:36:19] <DRmadness> Thanks for your help, JEEB. I appreciate the time you dedicated to me.
[20:36:37] <DRmadness> It has helped me a lot. Thnaks!
[20:36:42] <JEEB> DRmadness: I don't think setting correct values where applicable should make FFmpeg/ffmpeg.c not like it
[20:36:43] <DRmadness> *Thanks
[20:36:46] <JEEB> no problem

[20:37:48] <DRmadness> But it seems that double setting (in file, in flags) is causing some problem, at least they way I am doing iot. So I need to rethink.
[20:38:18] <DRmadness> Surely it's me doing the wrong thing, in any case I'll have to test it.
[20:38:45] <JEEB> and when the input doesn't have metadata set then using something like the setparams filter makes sense
[20:40:09] <DRmadness> But when you don't know if there's metadata or not, I though I'd set it myself anyway and be done. It turns out this seem to have led to a problem somewhere.
[20:40:35] <DRmadness> As I said, I fucked up somewhere in the command.
[20:40:39] <JEEB> if you don't know, you automate by either making your own application or just a script that calls ffprobe or so
[20:41:00] <JEEB> ffprobe -of json -show_programs -show_streams -show_format -i INPUT
[20:41:02] <JEEB> for example
[20:41:06] <JEEB> gives you machine parse'able stuff
[20:41:22] <DRmadness> Yep, that's wht I am doing in Python now, but meanwhile I have to get these videos out and have to do it manually
[20:42:43] <JEEB> but yea I wouldn't be surprised if you could do the graphics white level boosting with some filter but I don't know which :P after all, you don't have black'ish stuff to become less dark, but on the other hand you want to make it match HDR graphics white
[20:42:56] <JEEB> *you don't want
[20:44:02] <JEEB> because that was literally what my first attempt did lol
[20:44:03] <DRmadness> Right now anything that doesn't look ugly is enough. SDR stream is just closing credits or something along those lines.
[20:44:28] <JEEB> input*(203/100)
[20:44:35] <JEEB> (when input is linear)
[20:45:13] <JEEB> yea for credits the main issue is that they won't be white most likely when appended to HDR content :)
[20:45:22] <JEEB> but if that is Good Enough, then that might fly
[20:48:13] <DRmadness> They're colour artsy fonts, some two-tone logos, nothing too complicated, but couldn't show them as they were before. Now it will pass, I guess D:
[20:48:56] <JEEB> I think the newer ITU report did comment on this bit, might check it out at some point
[20:49:19] <JEEB> basically the newer one just gave out some random practices doing HDR<->SDR in a manner that I think is LUT'able
[20:49:33] <JEEB> of course that throws out dynamic stuff like figuring out the scene brightness etc
[20:49:45] <JEEB> (unless you want to recalculate your LUT for each scene)
[20:50:27] <DRmadness> ffmpeg needs some polisghing here and there. Basic needs are mostly covered but HDR and DRC for audio needs to be improved.
[20:51:10] <JEEB> consider that even zimg leaves the white handling as an exersize to the user :P
[20:51:17] <JEEB> (which is the library behind zscale)

[20:51:47] <JEEB> libplacebo as far as I know is the only thing that attmempts this in open source (unless the HDRTools thing does it)
[20:52:17] <JEEB> for internal filters, it helps to remember that the original scale filter's backbone was written before BT.709 was even a thought in the implementation :D
[20:52:39] <JEEB> we have certainly come a long way since then with stuff being somewhat standardized
[20:52:51] <JEEB> but now the oldest solutions need to be adjusted etc
[20:54:13] <DRmadness> Yep. Audio, too. DRC metadata is not managed, ffprobe doesn't output those values properly. One step a t a time.
[20:54:38] <DRmadness> Well, got to go, thanks gain!!!
