[01:02:57] <skyfall> What is the sentence starting with "had" called? What's the term that I should Google for?
[01:03:30] *** Joins: Tangent-Man (~Tang3nt-M@cpc145602-basl14-2-0-cust33.20-1.cable.virginm.net)
[01:03:34] <skyfall> I noticed a few people starting sentences with "Had" but no idea about their usage rules. 
[01:03:37] <Maxdamantus> skyfall: if it's a statement, probably subjunctive.
[01:03:51] <Maxdamantus> skyfall: "Had I known better, ..."
[01:03:58] <skyfall> Yeah, something like that.
[01:04:58] <skyfall> So, the syntax is like: "Had ....., I would have ......." right?
[01:05:19] <skyfall> Like, "Had I bought that iPhone, I would have been feeling good about myself."
[01:06:01] <skyfall> Is this sentence grammatically correct?
[01:06:27] <Maxdamantus> Yes, that sounds correct.
[01:06:33] <skyfall> Alright, thanks!
[01:07:28] *** Joins: wakeup (~wakeup@user/wakeup)
[01:08:24] <Maxdamantus> Using "were" instead of "had" might better demonstrate that it's subjunctive (since "were" and "was" are past subjunctive/indicative respectively, but the past subjunctive/indicative forms of "had" and "had" sound the same)
[01:08:39] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[01:09:05] <Maxdamantus> "Were I dumb enough to buy that iPhone, I would be miserable."
[01:09:30] <skyfall> Oh, I misread "subjunctive" as "subjective". 
[01:10:47] <skyfall> Ah, interesting. I never thought I could start a sentence with "were".
[01:11:04] <skyfall> I'll read about "subjunctive".
[01:12:45] <skyfall> but hey, you wouldn't be miserable after getting an iPhone :-)
[01:12:51] <Maxdamantus> It's not very common in typical speech, and indicative forms of words are often used in place of subjunctive ones in other constructions.
[01:13:15] <Maxdamantus> Can I run an unmodified version of Debian on it?
[01:14:13] <skyfall> Hmm..probably not. Well, it's hard to root Android these days to get around vendor restrictions. But, does Debian even have an phone OS? I know Ubuntu has one.
[01:14:24] <skyfall> I guess that's offtopic. 
[01:15:55] <Maxdamantus> Hard, but possible. I made my own root system which lets me run a normal Debian installation alongside Android, without giving up bootloader-based security.
[01:17:06] <Maxdamantus> root can only be achieved by sshing into it as root, which I don't normally do, so even someone with my unlock code can't necessarily get root.

[01:31:06] <Maxdamantus> So unlocking/rooting shouldn't void the warranty, at least on OnePlus.
[01:31:47] <Maxdamantus> I think it does on Samsung. Samsung phones supposedly have a fuse that is blown when unlocking, so they can always detect it.

[07:07:06] <CuriosTiger> Today's nitpick: "Wreckless driving" is not the same as "reckless driving". It's dangerously close to the OPPOSITE.
[07:07:17] <CuriosTiger> Also, howdy, all.
[07:07:25] *** Joins: LuisR14 (~LuisR14@187.135.227.12)
[07:07:59] <Me-me> I hereby corroborate your criticism in the case of that former term being extant.
[07:08:11] <CuriosTiger> It's a rather common misspelling.
[07:08:27] <CuriosTiger> and one someone just used on me in another channel, in the context that he was ticketed for "wreckless driving".
[07:08:28] <Me-me> I've never seen it. But I'll take your word for it.
[07:08:48] <CuriosTiger> I've seen it frequently, and it made me want to deadpan: "Ticketed? You should be rewarded!"
[07:08:55] <CuriosTiger> but he wouldn't get it.
[07:09:25] <Me-me> You could always play dumb. "Wreckless? As in no wrecks? That doesn't sound like a crime to me."
[07:11:03] <CuriosTiger> The actual quote, nick removed: "so street racing is auto 1 year suspension in IL supspodly but i got a lawyer who got that tossed out if i plead guility to the wreckless driivng charge and speeidng ticket also  gets dropped too "
[07:11:05] <CuriosTiger> [sic]
[07:11:45] <Me-me> I mean. I'm more impressed by the variate errors necessary to construct "supspodly" than the "wreckless".
[07:12:00] <Me-me> Oh, what's this, it's my friend Spodly. 'Sup, Spodly?
[07:13:04] <CuriosTiger> Me-me: This is how this person communicates. But yes, that spelling takes talent.
[07:13:49] <Me-me> It shows a dedication to not improving.
[07:16:57] <CuriosTiger> He might be trying to hurt my brain.
[07:19:42] <Me-me> Anyway I don't think I'll go with Enhanced. I'm looking for something more impactful, maybe more explicit.
[07:20:04] <Me-me> Context: Word for "superhero" that isn't that. Can't use metahuman because humans might not exist in the setting.

[12:51:40] <Guest87678> "achieve an achievement" sounds stupid, so what verb would you use instead of "achieve" there?
[12:52:48] <Me-me> "Obtain", "reach", "complete", "get".
[12:54:49] <Guest87678> I meant for example in "What achievement did you <verb> that led to your promotion?"

[12:55:20] <Guest87678> oh

[12:58:23] <Guest87678> okay
[12:58:44] <Guest87678> Unrelatedly, yesterday was the first time I ever saw anyone use "obtain" without an object and I thought it was an error at first
[12:59:52] <Guest87678> "If the benefit of liberty is assurance that one is free from the harm other citizens might do to oneself, does Montesquieu think, then, that liberty obtains if the law only forbids citizens from engaging in those act that harm other citizens?"
[13:00:19] <Guest87678> It's like words have obscure uses to intentionally throw ESLs off, hah
[13:00:59] <Me-me> Not to overcomplicate things, but that particular use of "obtain" is archaic. It would be "liberty is obtained" now.
