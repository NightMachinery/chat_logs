[01:38:55] <bagder> I replied that "I'll be willing to answer all your questions regarding our software once we have a contract"

[02:50:50] <Piru> I wonder if Tim there has any idea what of comms are coming from the company
[02:51:32] <Piru> https://github.com/ttyler01 this guy here, I mean
[02:51:56] <Piru> I'm hoping it wasn't him sending the email :>
[02:52:17] <bagder> "Sincerely, MetLife Information Security" ...
[02:54:10] <Piru> uff
[02:56:19] <bagder> https://gist.github.com/bagder/b2101055f75947152f02995837b62813
[02:56:32] <bagder> if its fake, it's a good fake
[02:57:07] <bagder> but otoh, it makes little sense to send a fake mail like this
[03:01:21] <crashrep> "If you are not the right person, please forward this message to the appropriate contact" . . . . . . . "If you are not the intended addressee, please notify the sender immediately and delete this message", lol
[03:07:43] <bagder> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife not a tiny operation ...
[03:31:18] <Piru> that sounds very much like some compliance stuff fired out automatically
[03:32:06] <Piru> and they do that/similar thing for all major vulns
[03:32:20] <bagder> yes, it certainly sounds like that
[03:33:51] <Piru> seems very much legal thing considering how old news log4j is by now. I mean yes it's problem but anyone with a pulse has fixed that stuff ages ago by now
[03:35:30] <Piru> I'd imagine this is covering their arses in case some sw component they use causes security incidents. basically shift the blame or find some contractual clause where they could pin the bill to that particular partner 
[03:35:51] <Piru> interesting though that they fire the same email to even open source "partners"
[03:36:10] <Piru> corporations... you never know with these beasts
[03:37:32] <bagder> its best to not waste much energy on it

[10:00:04] <jekakiev> Hello
[10:02:35] <jekakiev> Could you please help me figure out what is wrong with my curl scripts? I'm using curl to upload file to webdav server and I have noticed that scripts stopped working after migrating to debian bullseye
[10:05:04] <jekakiev> echo "test" | curl -v -u "CENSORED:CENSORED" -T - https://webdav.mydrive.ch/inbox/cat creates empty file on server when from bullseye machine (curl 7.74) 
[10:07:19] <jekakiev> Same command creates file with text from stdin when executed on debian buster (curl 7.64) 
[10:13:30] <jekakiev> curl output is almost identical in both cases with, only major difference I have noticed is warning about marking bundle not supporting multiuse
