[00:54:54] <apollo13> nedbat, moldy: Late reply because I was sailing :) md5 can be a problem if used in a security relevant context. The main problem here is that FIPS enabled stuff simply forbids it and as such some pythons (redhat?) can have it disabled. There are proposals to add a "not_security_related" kwarg to hashlib so one can still use the algo
[00:55:45] <apollo13> nedbat, moldy: That said I do not think that the usage in coverage has any security impact so md5 is perfectly fine. Sadly enough users still might report it as security issue for not knowing better

[16:50:01] <avivace> Hello! I'm looking for a way to apply a couple of filters in a query but since they are specified through optional query parameters I have no idea on how to build the query..
[16:52:03] <avivace> I have tried https://dpaste.org/o83M, simply putting the filter in if conditions, reusing the QuerySet but it doesn't work when both of the if statements are executed..
[16:52:14] <avivace> I feel like I'm missing something obvious
[16:53:39] <SpecialK> avivace: it's hard to tell because that code example is redacted past the point of being helpful, but generally speaking, that looks right
[16:54:05] <SpecialK> (depending on what `developer` is etc.)
[16:54:11] <SpecialK> Can you share the actual code?
[16:54:53] <avivace> developer and platform are supposed to be "a" and "b" from the query params
[16:55:31] <avivace> So in principle this should work? When I pass one query  param it works, but when I pass both (so both if statements gets executed) I get empty results
[16:56:12] <SpecialK> In principle it should work
[16:56:22] <SpecialK> Are you expecting OR behaviour? (You're doing AND)
[16:56:46] <avivace> I'm expecting AND, yes
[16:56:48] <avivace> full code: https://dpaste.org/qFba
[16:57:16] <moldy> line 3 does nothing, is that intended?
[16:57:53] <moldy> that cannot be the real code :) it throws NameError on line 19
[16:58:21] <avivace> Great, just noticed about line 20
[16:58:59] <avivace> So that's why it doesn't work, tries to match with an empty value - thanks guys!

[17:07:21] <nedbat> i guess it's not possible to have STATIC_URL set to "/" and also have some urls served by django? I want /favicon.ico to be static, and /blog to be django, for example.
[17:07:59] <SpecialK> nedbat: it's old but the principles of https://staticfiles.productiondjango.com/blog/failproof-favicons/ still stand
[17:08:31] <nedbat> SpecialK: the favicon.ico was just an example. I have many static files.
[17:08:53] <SpecialK> ah
[17:09:24] <SpecialK> You probably _could_ do it but I imagine you'd need to fiddle a fair bit in your fronting proxy

[17:35:49] <gs> sleep deprivation. head standing still. want to implement a simple login flow for kids. the parent creates the account and adds their children. the kids can connect to the account with their tablets or phones (react webapp for mvp, native apps if it works out). was thinking either a short code to identify family and a short code to identify family member, store the combination in localStorage and use in every
[17:35:55] <gs> request. but that would require a few characters to "eliminate" collisions. another option would be ephemeral keys. create a unique 6-character long alpha numeric string that expires on first use or after X days. user submits code and a session is established. new code must be generated if the session expires.
[17:37:01] <gs> both flows could be combined with a qr codes (first one you could print the codes and put on the fridge if the kids need to re-auth, second version they could scan directly from parents device).
[17:37:10] <gs> any other options and/or thoughts about my flows?

[20:56:36] <bancroft> I have a form that i'm displaying with `generic.edit.UpdateView` and there is a list of fields in the class based form update view. What I would like to do is also be able to edit values in the foreignkeys of this object (so from the same page where I have my update view of a project with a FK of resources, I would like to be able to update any number of the resources names.
[20:56:40] <bancroft> Is this possible?

[21:00:36] <bancroft> Essentially, I keep getting an error when I try to add the FK in the list of fields in my class view, so it seems like I can not edit it?

[21:33:10] <nedbat> moldy: i hadn't considered a separate domain. I'm porting over an existing site, so i'm reluctant to change urls too much.
