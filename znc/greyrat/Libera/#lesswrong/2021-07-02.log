[00:49:02] <catern> shawwwn: what is the language that you like macros in?

[00:50:03] <dbohdan> shawwwn: What do you think of Bel?
[00:50:04] <catern> shawwwn: ah and does that have easy calls out to native Lua and JS functions?
[00:50:29] <shawwwn> Lumen Lisp solved both of those at once: it runs on luajit or JS (or any other language you want, really). It's an extraordinarily thin wrapper over the host language
[00:50:49] <shawwwn> the thinness turned out to be an extreme advantage. Most people dismiss tiny things as toys, but that's fine.
[00:51:32] <shawwwn> dbohdan: I implemented most of it. It's great work, but the only interesting part to me was the idea of making the simplest possible multithreaded lisp.

[00:55:27] <gwern> no, I think I've updated on UFOs being even more bunk than I thought
[00:55:37] <dbohdan> Oh, really?  Why?
[00:56:08] <gwern> the absurdity of what is necessary for UFOs to be aliens just keeps rising every year, and the data remains garbage. the harder pro-UFOs push, the more they show there's nothing there
[00:56:49] <gwern> and there seems to be a lot of double-counting of evidence in creating a quasi-echo-chamber

[01:10:18] <nshepperd> but that's ridiculous when they are vastly now technologically advanced than us, and could probably blow up our planet with one blast of their thrusters
[01:10:19] <RiversHaveWings> Cause we aren‚Äôt understanding it
[01:10:31] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: pretty much. every year, the surviving UFO hypothesis becomes ever more utterly bizarre, insane, and post hoc tailored to evidence
[01:11:11] <gwern> I mean, once you start hitting hypotheses like '...the aliens are using the equivalent of laser pointers to insult us while being bound by a galactic government...'
[01:11:15] <dbohdan> nshepperd: They don't want to, and wish to make that clear.  Probably because of panspermia.
[01:11:55] <RiversHaveWings> They are not in fact making anything clear
[01:12:02] <Obormot\Gaia> ooh there's a new spider in my bathroom window frame
[01:12:04] <Betawolf> clearly the aliens are the galactic equivalent of high school kids
[01:12:07] <Obormot\Gaia> It is very, very small
[01:12:08] <nshepperd> the point is there is no risk to them

[01:13:12] <Obormot\Gaia> It is maybe 2-3mm body length

[08:44:55] <lizzie> I'm not judging who likes what...  nor am I defending HPMOR as the great work of rationalism that it seems to think it is...  but I wasn't bored, and I usually bore easily
[08:45:52] <lizzie> I just appreciate the premise of "Harry Potter but if he thought for himself ever"
[08:45:54] <quanticle> Yeah, I think it's just taste, to be honest
[08:46:05] <Logos01> HPMOR had a moderately strong beginning, but EY shot himself with it by getting too distracted halfway through and trying to stick his originally-conceived ending.
[08:46:09] <quanticle> I appreciated the premise, and the story started off okay
[08:46:14] <Logos01> Which was conceived when he was a much worse author.
[08:46:17] <quanticle> But like, in the middle, he needs an editor
[08:46:20] <lizzie> maybe it's partly just because I grew up on Harry Potter and grew to dislike it, so seeing a good spoof was entertaining
[08:46:25] <Logos01> quanticle: The entire fucking SPHEW arc.
[08:46:30] <lizzie> I can agree with Logos01.  THe beginning was stronger
[08:46:39] <quanticle> It's like a smaller version of the Worm problem
[08:46:45] <Logos01> The Sunshine Regiment stuff was decent, but the whole SPHEW thing was shoehorned and ill-executed.
[08:46:53] <quanticle> Where it's like, you can cut multiple hundreds of pages out of this thing
[08:46:57] <quanticle> And not affect the end result at all
[08:47:33] <lizzie> I remember the sunshine regiment.  I might need a reminder of what SPHEW was
[08:48:04] <Logos01> Society for the Promotion of Heroic Ethical Witches
[08:49:28] <Logos01> In which EY overweaningly and ineffectually attempts to 'character develop' Hermione as a mighty Feminist Revolution Che Guevarra.
[08:49:47] <Logos01> Only for the whole thing to abortively fall into obscurity and never be mentioned again.
[08:50:29] <Logos01> Worse still, he used his Rationalist Wunderkind Expy to attempt to trigger this. The whole thing was just awkward and befuddled.
[08:50:54] <Logos01> lizzie: Fun fact: the Sunshine Regiment stuff was based on what is now known to be junk science.
[08:51:02] <Logos01> (See also: the Robber's Cove fraud)
[08:51:06] <lizzie> oh no!  what junk science is that?
[08:51:21] <Logos01> .g Robber's Cove Experiment
[08:51:23] <feepbot> Logos01: https://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html Robbers Cave Experiment / Realistic Conflict Theory | Simply Psychology
[08:52:08] <Logos01> Turns out the guy who published the results of that experiment lied to the world about the fact that it took him four tries to get his results because the kids kept not being assholes to each other and wanting to cooperate and help one another out.
[08:52:55] <lizzie> the whole thing amounts to a sample size of 1.  There are no independent variables here.  So not a big surprise that he p-hacked his sample size of 1 xD
[08:52:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Absurd >:(
[08:53:27] <Logos01> lizzie: I mean, the Milgram Experiment and the Stanford Prison Experiment and the John/Joane Experiment were all equally fraudulent.
[08:53:47] <Logos01> Not just *non-repeatable* but largely there's evidence of legit actual fraud.
[08:54:30] <lizzie> fun...
[08:55:06] <Logos01> So much of the foundations of contemporary social psych and its derivatives are based on known junk science.
[08:55:24] <Logos01> But somehow this hasn't percolated into college classrooms yet.
[08:56:17] <adiabatic> what's the incentive to correct for that when it's a useful truthy parable
[08:56:40] <PlanckWalk> In one of my previous jobs, they were basing a whole training course (nationally registered, ~$2000 per person) around thoroughly junk social psych :-(
[08:57:08] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: Don't even get me started on that INTJ shit.
[08:57:34] <PlanckWalk> This was (somehow) even worse :(
[08:57:44] <Logos01> adiabatic: Especially since the papers most of the professors got their Ph.D.'s on are based on those original experiments all too frequently.
[08:57:51] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: ... I'm morbidly curious.
[08:57:56] * Logos01 rests chin on palm
[08:57:58] <Logos01> Go on...
[08:59:54] <PlanckWalk> One example: they took the Mehrabian 7/38/55 study and managed to misinterpret it *even further* into saying that the actual *information content* was divided into those precise proportions.
[09:00:23] <PlanckWalk> And then devised their training modules about exactly how much of that was allocated to various communication channels.
[09:03:42] <lizzie> that's horrifying.
[09:04:13] <Logos01> I mean at least the core study of the Mehrabian theory is reproducible.
[09:04:15] <Logos01> But yeah.
[09:04:33] <lizzie> I would love for them to invite anyone who understands information theory into the room to enforce that.  They basically wouldn't be allowed to talk without an appropriate amount of dancing and singing-flourishes.
[09:04:56] <Logos01> Meyers-Briggs typing is just straight up phrenology.
[09:05:26] <PlanckWalk> The basic idea behind MBTI isn't just phrenology, but all the shit layered on top of it is.
[09:05:27] <Logos01> lizzie: based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian#Criticism it's a little worse than that.
[09:05:27] <Robomot> Albert Mehrabian - Wikipedia [Criticism] (Albert Mehrabian, born in 1939 to an Armenian family living in Iran, is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles.[1] Although he originally trained as an engineer,[1] he is best known for his publications on the relative importance of verbal and nonverbal messages. ‚Ä¶)
[09:05:55] <PlanckWalk> (and there is a huge pile of it layered on top)
[09:05:55] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: No, even the core conceit of MBTI is phrenology-tier pseudoscience.
[09:06:21] <Logos01> lizzie: The Mehrabian studies apparently didn't include bodylanguage.
[09:06:29] <PlanckWalk> What, the idea of classifying personality types by questionnaires?
[09:06:34] <Logos01> And only studied women.
[09:07:09] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: The idea that there are personality types at all.
[09:07:16] <lizzie> so wikipedia says: "According to Mehrabian,[4] the three elements account differently for our liking for the person who puts forward a message concerning their feelings: words account for 7%, tone of voice accounts for 38%, and facial expression accounts for 55% of the liking."
[09:07:21] <lizzie> pretty reasonable.  not too surprising.
[09:07:48] <lizzie> The website with the best SEO for those three numbers says: "Mehrabian‚Äôs 7-38-55 rule is a theory that seeks to quantify how much of meaning is communicated via verbal and nonverbal communication methods."
[09:07:55] <lizzie> that sure is...  very...  not similar
[09:08:21] <lizzie> it also sounds exactly like what PlanckWalk described
[09:08:39] <Logos01> lizzie: Indeed.
[09:08:57] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: So like, compare the closest "real" science to MBTI: the Big5 index.
[09:09:00] <lizzie> It's almost as if there are people out there with a frustrating lack of concern for being correct about stuff!
[09:09:25] <Logos01> If you assert that each trait has a score from 1-10, the five traits then if asserted to be "personality types" would result in 100,000 "personality types".
[09:09:27] <lizzie> and they get paid all the consulting money anyways, that's the most annoying part
[09:09:47] <Logos01> But -- Big5 indices do not presume to be exhaustive. For example Big5 does not account for Dark Triad traits *at all*.
[09:09:48] <nshepperd2> the idea that people have different personalities is pretty mainstream
[09:09:59] <saturn2> ah yes, the study that let everyone who loved to waste time blabbing on the phone call everyone else a science denier. love it
[09:10:07] <PlanckWalk> Logos01: Are you talking about putting artificial numerical boundaries "between" types?
[09:10:27] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: No. Follow the consquence of my last statement.
[09:10:34] <nshepperd2> the MBTI 'types' probably don't exist in a taxometric sense
[09:10:46] <Logos01> "For example Big5 does not account for Dark Triad traits *at all*."
[09:10:47] <PlanckWalk> Logos01: I believe I am
[09:11:40] <Logos01> In other words, I was saying that even if you "tried" to make "personality types" out of the unique set of all possible scores of all five traits, that *STILL* wouldn't get you "types".
[09:11:44] <nshepperd2> gender doesn't account for dark triad traits either but exists
[09:12:17] <Logos01> nshepperd2: Big5 can predict sex assigned at birth with above random accuracy, though.
[09:12:28] <Logos01> But yes.
[09:12:34] <PlanckWalk> Logos01: "Types" here refer to more like "cluster centres", not "categories with hard boundaries"
[09:13:12] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: The thing of it is, especially for MBTI types -- a significant set of people will not have any appreciable consistency in their MBTI type.
[09:13:25] <Logos01> It fluctuates from testing incident to testing incident.
[09:13:38] <PlanckWalk> Yes, and the MBTI literature tells you that variations in test scores can happen.
[09:13:48] <PlanckWalk> But then all the stuff piled on top assumes that they're fixed.
[09:13:52] <Logos01> It had best well do so, since it happens so often.
[09:13:55] <lizzie> I don't think we have the technology to "measure" people's "personalities" well enough that we can put them into clusters and have much confidence that those clusters are useful, yet.
[09:14:02] <PlanckWalk> lizzie: I agree
[09:14:10] <Logos01> But the core point is that asserting that there *are* "types" of personalities is misguided.
[09:14:10] <lizzie> or I should rephrase that...  not into 100,000 clusters
[09:14:17] <lizzie> there are some much more coarse things we probably understand alright
[09:14:41] <PlanckWalk> MBTI was a somewhat misguided attempt at coarse-graining personalities.
[09:14:43] <Logos01> lizzie: I mean we have enough rigor in Big5 data to be able to say that men are consistently less agreeable than women.
[09:14:49] <nshepperd2> well, you're not supposed to put people into clusters, you're supposed to chart the results of your personality survey and go "huh, there's a cluster"
[09:15:07] <Logos01> nshepperd2: Exactly.
[09:15:13] <PlanckWalk> nshepperd2: Which they purported to have done
[09:15:20] <lizzie> Logos01: yes, I needed big data science for that!
[09:15:23] <Logos01> That, ultimately, is the real failure-mode of MBTI.
[09:15:25] <PlanckWalk> (They really didn't, but that came out later)
[09:15:32] <Logos01> lizzie: lol
[09:15:49] <Logos01> lizzie: It goes the other way too: women are consistently more neurotic than men.
[09:16:22] <lizzie> well that's inconvenient!
[09:16:43] <Logos01> lizzie: Of course the *real* "big data" reveal is that these differences are bell-curve-edge dominant.
[09:17:08] <Logos01> "Men and women can be told apart by their data, but the signal difference with which one can do this is small."
[09:17:16] <lizzie> also I think your use of "x are consistently more trait than y" could be misinterpreted as "random pairs of an x and a y"
[09:17:19] <lizzie> though I know what you mean
[09:18:00] <Logos01> Well I mean, it would be better expressed as "a sufficiently large set of random/arbitrary pairs of X and Y would reveal consistent patterns"
[09:18:03] <lizzie> what does the signal difference being small mean?
[09:18:05] <nshepperd2> 'big data' aka printing a bar chart instead of running ANOVA without ever looking at the data
[09:18:30] <PlanckWalk> Yes, more "in large population studies, the mean of x in this metric is greater than y by more than can reasonably be attributed to chance"
[09:18:36] <Logos01> lizzie: Well, say that you have fifteen million test scores. And one group of people consistently score 0.5% higher than everyone else.
[09:18:42] <lizzie> Logos01: there's no reason for them to be pairs, right?  just a sufficiently large sample from each population
[09:18:43] <Logos01> That's *detectable* but the variance is small.
[09:19:15] <Logos01> Statistically significant but weakly variant.
[09:19:21] <lizzie> but my point is, I think that's one of the common mental slips people make when translating from a statistical trend to making assumptions in an individual situation.
[09:19:22] <PlanckWalk> For any given pair the probabibility of an X being greater than a Y might be 0.51 instead of 0.50.
[09:19:32] <Logos01> lizzie: Indeed, indeed.
[09:19:33] <nshepperd2> "women is consistently more neurotic than men"
[09:19:58] <lizzie> If you say "X are more consistently Z than Y", it actually is reasonable for someone to misinterpret that as "for a random X and a Y, you will consistently find that the X is more Z"
[09:20:11] <Logos01> Anyone who tries to reduce from population data to the individual instance is making a very clear category of error.
[09:20:17] <lizzie> it's ambiguous wording
[09:20:17] <Logos01> Though I can't recall the name of it right now.
[09:20:26] <Logos01> I'm being a filthy casual right now. So meh.
[09:20:34] <lizzie> and I bring it up because I think a lot of people who don't understand statistics *do* make that misunderstanding
[09:20:40] <Logos01> Valid.
[09:20:54] <PlanckWalk> It's probably more "consistent across cultures and subpopulations" than "consistent between pairs of people".
[09:21:06] <PlanckWalk> (To the extent that it's reasonable to call it consistent at all)
[09:21:27] <Logos01> Yes.
[09:22:21] <lizzie> maybe the better phrasing is "women consistently have a higher rate of neurosis than men" since "rate" implies you're referring to populations
[09:22:22] <two2thehead> lizzie, as you SHOULD! :V
[09:22:23] <Logos01> PlanckWalk: That's actually a point that is quite worth calling out and to my knowledge it *HAS* been confirmed since they started using Big5 tests a little over 30 years ago.
[09:22:29] <nshepperd2> at least you don't go around "X are significantly more Z than Y" on the basis that the difference is detectable with p<0.05 with a sufficiently large sample size
[09:23:07] <Logos01> lizzie: Well you want to emphasize that you're only really pointing specifically to a numerical score on a test, as opposed to asserting this is a colloquial behavior.
[09:23:10] <Logos01> But yeah.
[09:23:34] <nshepperd2> 'but i thought you said it was significant' 'nonono, *statistically* significant. which means insignificant'
[09:23:39] <lizzie> And yeah I think the biggest way most laypeople get confused is mixing up strength of evidence with effect size.  You can be super confident of a trend with a small effect size, and then often the rational thing to do is ignore the trend because it's useless.

[09:25:11] <lizzie> Personally, I think the only solution to a functioning society is to teach everyone statistics.  But maybe I should take that to -politics.

[09:25:50] * two2thehead clicks
[09:26:39] <Logos01> When discussing this stuff I tend to try to append "Big5" before the specific trait, because they kinda shit the bed politically with the naming convention of traits.
[09:27:02] <PlanckWalk> Completely agreed :)
[09:27:07] <Logos01> (Even if they *are* readily identifiable names for being correlated with the traits, it's still an issue.)
[09:27:17] <namespace> gwern: You mean did I see the hilarious reveal that AI Dungeon was trained on wtf-tier training data?
[09:27:31] <namespace> Yes, yes I did lol.
[09:28:19] <lizzie> looking through this...  the population differences for any given trait don't seem to go much higher than half the standard deviations
[09:28:26] <lizzie> so it all goes in the "interesting but useless" category
[09:28:35] <Logos01> lizzie: Remember that *each* trait has that difference.
[09:28:57] <lizzie> and each trait has a standard deviation (for each population)
[09:29:00] <Logos01> And it's a bit like error margins -- you need to compound it for each dataset.
[09:29:41] <Logos01> Well yeah, that's why I have been saying that it's "Better than random" but only that.
[09:29:44] <lizzie> I'm looking at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/table/T2/
[09:29:44] <Robomot> PubMed Central, Table 2: Front Psychol. 2011; 2: 178. Published online 2011 Aug 1.

[09:29:47] <lizzie> does it not include all the data?
[09:29:54] <nshepperd2> ofc with bell curve traits a mean difference of 1% can add up to a big practical difference when you're looking at how many people have +3sd in it
[09:30:42] <Logos01> nshepperd2: There's also that.
[09:30:43] <lizzie> that's if you can assume that your trait actually behaves like a bell curve that far from the mean
[09:30:48] <lizzie> I'd assume some do and some don't

[09:31:48] <Logos01> Shortform -- all five trait ranges are pretty much bellcurve.
[09:31:51] <lizzie> anyways I tire of acknowledging that statistical gender differences exist, let's talk about something else :P
[09:32:04] <Logos01> lol, sorry for being hyperfocused on this I guess?
[09:32:12] <Logos01> In my defense I'm autistic and it was crunchy.
[09:32:20] <lizzie> well actually I'm not gonna get in the way of what you want to talk about
[09:32:32] <lizzie> but I still think it's true that there's very little practical application
[09:32:44] <lizzie> mostly when I think about this stuff, I think of all the undesirable people who use it for political fodder :P
[09:32:51] <Logos01> No, no, being called out that someone is tired of a topic is a useful thing to do to someone like me.
[09:32:54] <lizzie> heavily mis-applying statistics of course.
[09:32:58] <Logos01> Yes.
[09:32:58] <lizzie> not talking about anyone here.
[09:33:26] <nshepperd2> people not understanding tail effects is probably worse than the rest of it
[09:33:52] <Logos01> I mean for the last 23 years I've been in the position of being in the "ostracized and besmirched" political subset consistently.
[09:34:14] <lizzie> Am I allowed to recommend games in here or is that considered mind-poisoning?
[09:34:17] <Logos01> (I first identified as libertarian back then. It's been a wild ride, lemme tell ya.)
[09:34:26] <lizzie> and don't worry, *everyone* is ostracized and besmirched by somebody!
[09:34:49] <Logos01> No I mean I've basically never been in the position of having it *not* be done.
[09:35:05] <Logos01> But then again back in the day for example I used to argue for private ownership of nuclear arms.
[09:35:09] <Logos01> That's not hyperbole.
[09:35:20] <lizzie> That does seem like a bad idea.
[09:35:51] <Logos01> Some of the core arguments don't hold up nowadays.
[09:36:40] <Logos01> But the core gist of it was that I did not mean *corporations* but *citizens* -- and only those who could demonstrate recent psychiatric evaluation of their being of sound mind.
[09:37:51] <lizzie> I think that any time you make the decision to presume someone is "sane enough" because you tested them in some manner, you are balancing risk vs the cost of being wrong
[09:37:55] <lizzie> and nuclear weapons are pretty bad for that math
[09:38:01] <Logos01> Nowadays I more describe myself as a "lapsed" libertarian. I've given in to the fact that under no circumstances will the nation I live in ever adopt the political frameworks or principles that I believe create a righteous society.
[09:38:31] <lizzie> On the other hand, sooner or later, individual people will be able to create biological warfare agents and it probably can't be prevented, so *shrug*
[09:38:37] <Logos01> lizzie: See, that's the obvious objection -- but by contrast ... do you know how many nuclear weapons the governments of the world have lost or misplaced or accidentally shipped incorrectly?
[09:39:11] <Logos01> And unlike with private individual actors, the governments have been almost entirely immune to the consequences of these events.
[09:39:18] <lizzie> well...  yeah, it's quite concerning.  But I can at least claim consistency in that I've always been *against* our governments having such an enormous quantity of nuclear weapons.
[09:39:30] <Logos01> Well sure.
[09:39:57] <quanticle> I don't know about nuclear arms, but I sure would like private ownership of rocket propelled grenades
[09:39:58] <Logos01> But when the aliens come you'll change that tune right quick. O_^
[09:40:11] <lizzie> well if you wanna think about it tactically...  I just don't think a nuclear deterrent is useful to any entity who's total territory could be destroyed in a first strike
[09:40:14] <quanticle> Like, if you're serious about this "second amendment prevents tyranny" thing...
[09:40:20] <lizzie> owning one nuclear missile as an individual doesn't *work* as a deterrent
[09:40:24] <Logos01> quanticle: You know it's easier to ghostfab an RPG than it is an automatic rifle?
[09:40:41] <quanticle> Logos01: Wasn't aware that you could ghostfab plastic explosive
[09:40:46] <lizzie> maybe people will make mutual nuclear aid contracts on the ethereum blockchain...  that would be a terrifying future
[09:41:01] <quanticle> As I understand it, the precursor chemicals are all things that you need to get on a watchlist for
[09:41:02] <Logos01> lizzie: The easy rebuttal to that is the creation of the social convention of a nuclear response militia.
[09:41:15] <Logos01> lizzie: We already have hobbyist ham radio operators. The framework is there.
[09:41:35] <lizzie> what would a nuclear response militia do?  do they somehow stop nukes in flight?
[09:41:39] <Logos01> (I want to be clear: I'm not even remotely trying to persuade anyone of this position. I'm just making the points.)
[09:41:50] <lizzie> (yes, understood!  I am having too much fun with the idea now)
[09:41:53] <Logos01> lizzie: No, this would be a private MAD deterrent.
[09:42:18] <lizzie> so you know how I said deterrents don't work for an individual person?  I suspect they also don't work *against* an individual person

[09:43:08] <quanticle> lizzie: Wars have been started over stupider things. Have you heard of "The War of Jenkins' Ear"?
[09:44:03] <lizzie> so the argument is that we made it this far so more risk is probably fine?
[09:44:28] <lizzie> are you attempting to claim that the existing risk factors for nuclear missile launches dwarf the one that would be created if anyone who "seems sane" could have them?
[09:44:30] <Logos01> More that the systems we currently have are not appreciably riskier or less risky than what I'm discussing.
[09:44:41] <Logos01> At least, not *in principle*.
[09:45:26] <Logos01> Which point is the core of why I would ever bother with this kind of argument: I was never delusional enough to believe that anyone would sign up to make it happen.
[09:45:51] <Logos01> BUT -- Overton-window arguent shifting: if you can accept that core principle assertion for something *that* extreme, there's really nothing else it couldn't apply to.
[09:46:26] <Logos01> At which point I've accomplished the goal of getting people to think about how social needs could be solved by consensus of individuals rather than bureaucracy.
[09:47:51] <lizzie> Let's make ourselves a little nuclear war drake equation.  Here in 'Murrica, everyone who "seems sane" gets to own guns.  We know the rate of people who commit gun violence with no concern for their own survival.  Let's multiply that by the rate of suicidal murderers who *also* have no concern for other people, then multiply that by whatever factor you think accounts for your way better sanity-checking 
[09:47:57] <lizzie> system, and then multiply that by however much you think the higher cost of nuclear weapons compared to guns will function as a deterrent, and then tell me if the result is some super low-probability event we don't have to worry about
[09:47:58] <Logos01> Like when people talk about having "compassion" or "empathy" driven politics these days, it's noticeable how much baggage gets embedded in that equation.
[09:48:02] <lizzie> but you're multiplying a big number
[09:48:12] <Logos01> Like it's "obvious" that socialized medicine is the only compassionate answer to healthcare.
[09:48:59] <Logos01> lizzie: I mean 'seems sane' is a bit weak for the standard I applied of regular vetting of being of sound mind (compos mentis) by psychiatric professionals.
[09:49:33] <Logos01> And when you weaken that further with the comparison to gun ownership that becomes objectionable.
[09:49:50] <lizzie> Right, so consider the person who *wants* to be found of sound mind, because they *want* to be able to get nukes, and tell me what percentage of those people your system will catch, and multiply the remainder in
[09:50:35] <PlanckWalk> Let's allow anyone to "own" superintelligent GAIs.
[09:50:51] <PlanckWalk> Oh wait, we already do if anyone manages to make one.
[09:50:51] <lizzie> yeah...  that's...  what we should really be worried about
[09:51:02] <lizzie> since at least nuclear material is easier to detect and regulate I guess?

[11:39:20] <quanticle> And then you get murdered by the q before you can re-write Elbereth
[11:39:52] <quanticle> This was a regression from 3.4, which had Elbereth degrading based upon a percentage chance per turn

[11:46:37] <lizzie> quanticle: yeah that's an odd change.  It already degrades fast enough I'd think.
[11:47:47] <quanticle> Yeah, they had it that way for one point release and then immediately changed it back to the 3.4 behavior with 3.6.1
[11:48:06] <quanticle> I still don't understand what the purpose or reasoning was behind that change

[12:25:31] <sh4kesbeer> saturn2 thanks, but I can do it, I just got distracted. So here is my question I initially posted on the freenode server:
[12:25:33] <sh4kesbeer> Hi, I‚Äôm entirely new to this but I was wondering what the connection is between cryonics, effective altruism, friendly AI, and rationality? I‚Äôm curious about the reasons why the rationalism community is focused so much on these modes. When I Google for these topics it presents me Eliezer Yudkowsky as one of the top results. He seems to be a
[12:25:34] <sh4kesbeer> very influential personality in this community (I have read parts of his book ‚ÄúInadequate Equilibria‚Äù). So is it just some effect around this (or other personalities) that connects topics? I could imagine it is much like people who were/are interested in electric cars suddenly became interested in rocketry due to the personality Elon Musk being
[12:25:34] <sh4kesbeer> involved in both of them. But I hope there is some deeper/simpler/more abstract explanation for this.
[12:25:35] <sh4kesbeer> PS: I'm new to IRC chats and I don't even know if it is appropriate to post stuff like this here

[12:27:41] <quanticle> No, it's a valid question, but... I think timezones are not in your favor here. Most of #lesswrong is asleep, I bet
[12:28:35] <saturn2> the most straightforward explanation would be that those are the topics where the mainstream is making the biggest mistakes, thus rationality provides the most benefit

[12:32:25] <sh4kesbeer> @saturn2 Maybe your argument needs to be extended to "unknowingly making the biggest mistakes". Because I would argue that the average/median person is knowingly making big mistakes concerning exercising and food choices, no?
[12:35:15] <saturn2> well, maybe. there's no specific rational amount of exercise or tasty but unhealthy food
[12:37:20] <saturn2> also, there are numerous people talking about those things already, so it's unlikely that any rationalist advice would be heard over the din
[12:37:53] <saturn2> they've certainly been discussed before on LW though
[12:38:27] <synthmeat> EA always felt like an intruder to me, selling out in a way
[12:42:50] <sh4kesbeer> I don't really get why EA is about being effective instead of efficient. If I assume that it is just mislabled and efficient altruism is the ultimate goal, I feel the exact opposite. Isn't efficient X the outcome of applying rationality?
[12:44:22] <saturn2> well, once upon a time EA was just a few people who noticed that charity navigator didn't even try to rate charities on cost effectiveness
[12:44:43] <saturn2> but now it's a whole multibillion-dollar fundraising racket

[12:59:10] <sh4kesbeer> If I think about it now it seems that selecting charities is hard in the same way that investing is hard (survivorship bias e.g.). On the other hand, it does not seem like charities are approached with the same "rigor" (for lack of a better term), because I don't think someone advertising a particular charity for example using the EA brand as you
[12:59:11] <sh4kesbeer> said, needs to put a disclaimer ala "this is not investment advice". But then again it appears to me that most of the charity (in terms of funding) seems to have objectives/incentives closer to virtue signalling than to reducing suffering / improving well being.

[13:09:09] <Robomot> Highlights From The Comments On "How Asia Works": ... (Highlights From The Comments On "How Asia Works": ...)
[13:09:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> So Studwell talks about land reform in his book, right, as this Big Thing that was one of the big keys to making all those successful Asian economies work so well
[13:10:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Commenter one: "Secondly, he  completely ignores the many times land reform failed. East Asia is not  unique in its attempts at land reform. It was fairly common in Africa,  Eastern Europe, etc. Ukraine and Romania had incredibly fertile soil and  it's hard to think of regimes that eliminated their landlords harder.  Yet they haven't really seen similar effects."

[13:10:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Commenter two: "I came here to point  out the dreaded counterexample of Latin America, which tried to do a  number of things the East Asian countries did, but mostly failed. Mexico  basically carried out the greatest land reform initiative known to man  outside of Communism, but did not get the benefits Studwell describes.  Argentina & Chile also carried out large-scale land reform, to  lesser effect."
[13:11:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Commenter three (after some criticism): "(Land reforms are amazing, and  the closest thing to a consensus that I can think among developmental  economists. It's one of the few policies that don't have the  "equity-efficiency trade-offs" that one learns about in Econ 101.)"
[13:11:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> So ... land reforms are amazing? Or not amazing? I guess we just don't know
[13:11:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is there a consensus about this? We also don't know, apparently
[13:11:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> We don't know anything and we don't know whether anyone else knows anything
[13:11:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just a bunch of people claiming various contradictory things

[13:37:09] <Logos01> Yes.
[13:37:43] <quanticle> I'm not sure what they have in common. The answer I would have guessed is, "They were bombed by the US," but did we bomb Formosa?
[13:38:18] <Logos01> Japan, Not-Best Korea, and Taiwan are all nations with heavy US military-industrial investment.
[13:38:45] <Logos01> Post WWII Germany is much the same in this.
[13:39:37] <quanticle> Yeah, that's true, but you can look at other places in Asia, like Vietnam, for example, and they also follow the same trajectory, albeit delayed.
[13:39:39] <Logos01> Brazil, Mexico, and India on the other hand while equally within the USAican Hegemony -- unlike China in this -- have no military-industrial investment from the US.
[13:39:53] <Logos01> quanticle: Right but *they* are under Chinese hegemony.
[13:40:02] <Logos01> 2nd world.
[13:40:09] <quanticle> Vietnam? Eh... I'm not sure I'd describe them as being under Chinese hegemony
[13:40:12] <quanticle> They don't get along
[13:40:21] <Logos01> Like we get along with Venezuela?
[13:40:32] <quanticle> And they look to the US to counterbalance China, esp. w.r.t. conflicting claims over reefs and such in the South China Sea
[13:40:52] <Logos01> It's about who is the bull in that particular china closet.
[13:40:55] <quanticle> Well, sure, that's a fair point.
[13:41:06] <quanticle> Bull... I think you mean... bear ;)
[13:41:49] <Logos01> Actually it's bull in a china shop, apparently, but I always heard it as "china closet".
[13:42:04] <Logos01> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bull%20in%20a%20china%20shop
[13:42:05] <Robomot> Bull In A China Shop | Definition of Bull In A China Shop by Merriam-Webster (Bull in a china shop definition is - a person who breaks things or who often makes mistakes or causes damage in situations that require careful thinking or behavior.)
[13:42:23] <Logos01> I mean I'm already being pedantic about the 1st/2nd/3rd world definitions I'm on solid ground to be pedantic about this.
[13:42:33] <quanticle> Yes, I was making a bull/bear market pun and comboing off into a Winnie the Pooh
[13:43:05] <Logos01> So like ... Vietnam went Communist and then got in tiffs with China over the years. But that *does* mean that they fall/fell under Chinese hegemony and are 2nd-world.
[13:43:23] <Logos01> And the 2nd world is on a stunted economic trajectory historically compared to the 1st world.
[13:44:04] <Logos01> Let alone 3rd world nations like Brazil and India.
[13:44:14] <quanticle> Okay, I concur, but *not* because of China. Vietnam was always on the Soviet-side of the Sino-Soviet split
[13:44:21] <quanticle> So they end up in the 2nd world for that reason
[13:44:39] <Logos01> I see China as having assumed Soviet hegemony in southeast pacific asia.
[13:46:16] <Logos01> Like, Vietnam really doesn't like China but at the same time China can just freely trounce them and is belligerent about it really.
[13:46:34] <quanticle> I wouldn't assume that. I don't actually think China is as hegemonic a power as they're made out to be. Sure, they have hegemonic *aspirations*, but to be called hegemon, you have to be able to exclude other great powers from your backyard. In that sense, Russia has more actual hegemony than China. Russia can and does intervene in its neighboring states in order to exclude other great powers,
[13:46:36] <quanticle> like the European Union. It did so in Georgia and Ukraine. But when has China actively intervened, militarily, to displace an outside great power from its backyard?
[13:46:39] <quanticle> Sure, they protest on Twitter
[13:46:52] <quanticle> And levy the occasional economic boycott
[13:46:58] <quanticle> But that's a pretty weaksauce hegemony
[13:47:02] <Logos01> In the same context: If the US just up and decided to annex Mexico -- oh there'd be sanctions and diplomatic objections and perhaps even (gasp) trade restrictions ...
[13:47:18] <Logos01> But nobody on the planet would (who could actually project force) declare war with the US over it. *Nobody*.
[13:48:34] <quanticle> Right, the US has hegemony over North and South America. We can militarily exclude hostile great powers from our zone. We did so when the Soviets tried to reinforce Cuba.
[13:48:48] <Logos01> A thing worth remembering, quanticle, is that while China spends like 35% as much annually on their military as the US does, that still makes them the #2 spender.
[13:49:14] <Logos01> And the #3 spender is India at 28% of china.
[13:49:37] <quanticle> Yeah, it's a real power-law distribution, lol
[13:50:00] <Logos01> Russia is #4.  India spends 72B and Russia spends 62B.  China spends 252B and the US spends 778B.
[13:50:15] <quanticle> Anyway, like I said, Xi Jinping *wants* to be a hegemon... but he's definitely not a hegemon *yet*
[13:50:24] <Logos01> IIRC Russia is actually the #2 *exporter* of military arms though.
[13:50:28] <quanticle> He's taking steps in that direction, but hasn't achieved his goal
[13:50:39] <Logos01> Bear in mind that hegemony isn't a binary nor is it an absolute.
[13:50:47] <Logos01> It just means that you're the *biggest asshole in the room*.
[13:51:05] <quanticle> Yeah, and the biggest asshole in the room, currently, in Asia, is still the US, and specifically the US Navy
[13:52:11] <Logos01> Honestly if it isn't alraedy pulling ahead it's really only a matter of time at the current pattern IMHO.
[13:52:26] <quanticle> According to our naval planners, sometime around 2030
[13:52:48] <quanticle> Trust me, I've read a *lot* of DoD PDFs
[13:52:51] <quanticle> It's my hobby
[13:52:54] <Logos01> I expect them to ignore the soft power side of those assertions though.  China exerts hegemony in different ways than America does.

[15:54:26] <PapuaHardyNet> clickbait is the bane of the internet
[15:55:08] <PapuaHardyNet> sh4kesbeer: you are against GDPR entirely or just the way it has been enforced?
[15:56:05] <sh4kesbeer> Idk to be honest. I'm just annoyed by the banners on a superficial level
[15:59:12] <PapuaHardyNet> the banners are an externality. GDPR was one of the first serious attempts at improving the privacy of everyone.
[16:00:37] <sh4kesbeer> If I think a tiny bit more about it, I'm totally sure that the motivations behind GDPR were noble but I'm not sure if it is acutally necessary. I think the market will find a way to satisfy the consumers demand for privacy (if it is actually real). And I think with Apples recent moves pro privacy (they e.g. basically include Tor light in the next
[16:00:38] <sh4kesbeer> OS versions) indicate that these market meachanics are in tact
[16:02:43] <PapuaHardyNet> tor lite built into apple's OS? that's... is that good or bad news?
[16:03:26] <PapuaHardyNet> that will massively increase Tor traffic and therefore costs of node hosts, and require more nodes to be created. However, this would also increase the privacy of every tor user.
[16:04:29] <PapuaHardyNet> I think it is a net negative for tor users though. Apple users become freeriders, and the tor network will struggle.
[16:04:57] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry, got off topic, but that was big news
[16:04:59] <sh4kesbeer> Just to be clear, it is not actual Tor it is just a system with two hops. Afaik one is operated by Apple and another one by a third party. It uses the Tor concept to prevent any middle man from having the full metadata
[16:05:23] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, that's very good to hear

[16:08:47] <quanticle> And I'm not a libertarian either, but I think GDPR is dumb
[16:08:54] <sh4kesbeer> You're probably with the majority there. I gravitate to libertarianism because of its beautiful simplicity. In all other directions in my view it gets super messy with incentives all over the place. 
[16:09:15] <quanticle> GDPR: how Europe entrenched Facebook and Twitter as monopolies
[16:09:57] <quanticle> Sure that wasn't the intent, but that is the effect
[16:19:45] <PapuaHardyNet> sh4kesbeer: libertarianism is a winning philosophy right now, and will continue to be the winning strategy - until our civilization collapses
[16:20:00] <dbohdan> feep: I don't think I understand you.  Are you saying the difficulty comes from the author trying to fit the solution into some theoretical model?  The only model I see is the Haskell type system.  The constraint is simply "solve the expression problem without giving up type safety or modifying the Haskell compiler".
[16:20:37] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't see any other political philosophy really winning.
[16:20:54] <dbohdan> gwern: Another solution to the expression problem in Haskell is tagless final interpreters, and now I am not sure if the post I linked isn't a special case of them

[17:33:48] <dbohdan> s/this a/this/
[17:34:00] <catern> fantastic questions/feedback
[17:34:09] <dbohdan> Thanks
[17:39:55] * dbohdan2 published a bit of old code today: https://gitlab.com/dbohdan/gta3-package-locator
[17:39:56] <Robomot> D. Bohdan / gta3-package-locator ¬∑ GitLab (GTA III mod adding UFO-like rotating lights near hidden packages)
[17:41:24] <dbohdan2> The Hanson talk reminded me of it
[17:42:23] <feep> missing screens~
[17:42:40] <dbohdan2> There is an issue~ for it
[17:42:44] <feep> yay
[17:42:54] <feep> also might wanna change the readme to have the easy install steps in one dedi section
[17:42:55] <dbohdan2> The effect itself could definitely look better
[17:43:01] <feep> and then a separate building from source for the tcl version
[17:43:06] <dbohdan2> Good idea
[17:43:32] <PapuaHardyNet> you've developed your own mods, that's really nice
[17:45:20] <feep> > 23 files changed, 303 insertions(+), 458 deletions(-)
[17:45:21] <feep> ALRIGHT
[17:45:24] <feep> good commit~
[17:46:16] <catern> could be better, with a lower files changed :)
[17:46:40] <dbohdan2> PapuaHardyNet: I made a few mods and maps when I was a kid.  This I made later, in 2017, to help me with those sneaky few last packages when I was doing completionist playthrough of GTA III.
[17:46:56] <dbohdan2> I was actually surprised by how ugly the effect looks on my current monitor
[17:47:09] <dbohdan2> I wonder if it's because of Wine or wide screen or...
[17:47:38] <catern> dbohdan: the last sentences in the last two paragraphs in the introduction - do those address your questsions? http://catern.com/integration.html
[17:47:38] <Robomot> No more DSLs: Using typed code to deploy distributed systems directly
[17:48:11] <catern> feep: would the last sentence in the second paragraph make you feel more like reading it? :) http://catern.com/integration.html (I also removed "Python" from the title heh)
[17:48:11] <Robomot> No more DSLs: Using typed code to deploy distributed systems directly
[17:48:54] <feep> catern: um, you misunderstand me, the problem wasn't the python
[17:49:05] <feep> the problem is that I to a first approximation don't care about distributed systems.
[17:49:14] <catern> oops, very well
[17:49:25] <feep> python probably doesn't put people off fwiw
[17:49:32] <feep> or like ... distributed deployment, I guess, to put better
[17:49:35] <catern> nah I still think this is a good change
[17:49:44] <feep> there's people into that sort of integration stuff, I'm just not one~
[17:49:44] <dbohdan2> catern: They answer my questions with the exception of the one about SQLite sharing
[17:51:33] <catern> feep: what if I was to include a line along the lines of "this is a new object-capability secure way to write distributed systems, like existing distributed languages such as Erlang and E but supporting any language"
[17:52:14] <feep> I'm ... like, the problem isn't that I don't understand the reason why I should think this is cool
[17:52:18] <dbohdan2> (I want to take a screenshot, but GTA III won't start in Wine.)
[17:53:20] <feep> catern: you're just giving me more evidence why I don't find the topic of the article interesting :p
[17:53:21] <catern> feep: no no that's fine, you just corrected "I don't care about distributed systems" to "I don't care about distributed deployment", so what if I told you that it's really about the former, than the latter
[17:53:28] <feep> oh hm
[17:53:29] <feep> hm
[17:53:39] <feep> idk, I just sort of bounced off
[17:53:59] <feep> hm
[17:54:19] <feep> catern: okay, I tentatively grant that this should maybe interest me, I just bounced off the topic around the time you started pulling in python libraries
[17:54:34] <catern> yes that's fine, it's kind of oriented towards someone who *does* care about distributed deployment right now, but that's not necessarily good :)
[17:54:43] <feep> orient it towards people who care!
[17:55:03] <feep> don't try to pivot to people who aren't interested, that kills articles (and browsers, cough firefox cough)
[17:55:32] <feep> I feel the right way to do stuff is to fully commit to people who are interested back
[17:56:00] <catern> I don't *really* care about distributed deployment either tho :)
[17:56:04] <feep> oh XD

[17:56:22] <catern> yes yes this is fine, this is good feedback, I'll think about it
[17:56:50] <feep> dbohdan2: of curiosity, why don't you call your file generic.ide directly?
[17:58:10] <dbohdan2> feep: I want the name to be consistent between the self-built and the prebuilt version.  I am not sure I am right.
[17:58:19] <feep> oh, I see.
[17:58:56] <feep> idk, I feel people will run into difficulty with things more complex than "copy file into folder"
[17:59:03] <dbohdan2> True, true
[17:59:45] <PapuaHardyNet> re firefox: I just installed it, took one look at it, and uninstalled it
[17:59:51] <dbohdan2> You know, I can include different installation instructions for the self-builders and/or hope they can figure it out
[18:00:10] <dbohdan2> PapuaHardyNet: Rude!
[18:01:21] <PapuaHardyNet> :P
[18:01:35] <dbohdan2> What did you dislike so much about it?
[18:02:07] <PapuaHardyNet> the material design, and the homepage that looked extremely progressive
[18:02:37] <dbohdan2> I mean, the alternative is Google's
[18:03:20] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I'm using chromium and surf now
[18:03:47] <PapuaHardyNet> tbh, I've given up on ff, I knew that eventually I'd have to move
[18:04:11] <feep> waterfox~
[18:04:18] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: you can turn the weird new style off fwiw
[18:05:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll keep that in mind if I decide to use ff
[18:06:19] <PapuaHardyNet> but really, one can't keep fighting their browser's defaults
[18:06:56] <feep> about:config, proton, turn off everything

[18:16:10] <dbohdan2> Side note: GitLab import from GitHub is pretty good.  However, it doesn't import binaries attached to releases because GitLab's approach there is different and more complex.

[18:19:49] <catern> dbohdan: so I'm not sure I understand your question about SQLite sharing, could you elaborate a little on what you're asking and what you think some potential answers might be?
[18:20:27] <dbohdan2> catern: If you instantiate two services that use an SQLite database, what happens?

[23:26:12] <dbohdan> Can't do grayscale, either
[23:26:21] <feep> happening status: maybe is??
[23:27:21] <dbohdan> Still going slower than with the photos
[23:27:31] <saturn2> i predict it will work poorly
[23:27:45] <dbohdan> I, too
[23:27:56] <dbohdan> But it probably won't reconstruct the image
[23:28:11] <dbohdan> Due to no gradients
[23:28:22] <kuudes> apparently all of the recent infections from football from russia to finland have now been confirmed to be delta variant
[23:28:31] <dbohdan> kuudes: Ouch
[23:29:00] <dbohdan> I mean it will reconstruct the rough window outlines but the text will be all messed up

[23:32:01] <feep[cx]> alRIGHT! weird random tab crash bug fixed
[23:36:37] <dbohdan> Worse than I predicted: https://litter.catbox.moe/tufm0h.png

[23:36:51] <dbohdan> Now, Windows 3
[23:36:55] <feep> dbohdan: yeah, makes sense
[23:37:10] <gwern> dbohdan: I'm impressed it works at all
[23:37:14] <feep> maybe ignore high frequency components somehow?
[23:37:46] <gwern> one experiment might be to add some sort of grayscaling smoothing to see if that enables more global reconstruction
[23:38:33] <feep> some way to treat 01 as directly adjacent to 10
[23:39:02] <feep> maybe delta code the rows

[23:39:37] <feep> that looks like a screenshot in one of those sorting demo gifs
[23:39:44] <dbohdan> Now for Windows Me, which adds a gradient to the title bars

[23:41:16] <feep> also corona still looking good in germany
[23:41:55] <dbohdan> gwern: I'll try simple Gaussian blur
[23:41:58] <feep> seems it's staying in the same seasonal slump as last year
[23:42:47] <feep> dbohdan: that looks cool
[23:43:13] <feep> I like how it's "sorted" the letters
[23:43:42] <feep> also the color fades on the icons gave it plenty of info
[23:44:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Wow that cape is cool

[23:44:21] <feep> p much the one thing that reconstructed perfectly is "that column with all the colorfaded icons"

[23:46:43] <dbohdan> But where is the challenge in that?

[23:47:06] <gwern> 'When I went to write my own B tree, on the bookshelf behind me, I‚Äôve got Don Knuth‚Äôs The Art of Computer Programming, so I just pulled that down, I flipped to the chapter on searching and looked up B trees and he described the algorithm. That‚Äôs what I did. Funny thing, Don gives us details on the algorithm for searching a B tree and for inserting into a B tree. He does not provide an...
[23:47:12] <gwern> ...algorithm for deleting from the B tree. That‚Äôs an exercise at the end of the chapter, so before I wrote my own B tree I had to solve the exercise at the end. Thanks, Don. I really appreciate it.'

[23:48:05] <Robomot> Boeing 737 cargo plane makes emergency water landing off Hawaii | Reuters (A decades-old Boeing Co (BA.N) 737-200 cargo airplane with two people on board made an emergency nighttime landing in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii, early on Friday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said.)
[23:48:10] <kuudes> what's wrong with boeing?
[23:48:40] <gwern> 'a decades-old boeing 737' er are there very many which *aren't*?
[23:48:46] <gwern> or cargo planes in general
[23:48:48] <feep> too much going boeing has caused brain damage
[23:50:26] <gwern> (so it was a cargo plane, they had trouble early on, made a nice controlled descent onto some friendly water, and both survived with no particular injuries noted. as far as 'we've lost a plane', this is about as best-case outcome as it gets. what's the problem?)
[23:50:51] <feep> no yeah that's fair
