[01:13:06] <LordKalma> how can I configure services in a docker-compose file so that I can use the container domain names from the host? Like, if I have some container service called `foo` I want to be able to do http://foo from the host. I've tried `network_mode: host` but that's direct "on-host", not what I want. Because I need the services to still be able to also do that with eachother

[02:31:43] <tabakhase> in short, configuring the host is not dockers job. (and that proxy thing and "directly poking into docker0" is more an accident that it even works than supported method) - port-publishing is the way.

[03:00:45] <sudomann_> I had created a multiplatform image a few weeks ago. Today I rebuilt with updates and amended, then pushed the new manifest (the layer ids are updated as I can see)
[03:01:10] <tabakhase> delete the tag, then garbage collection to cleanup layers
[03:01:20] <sudomann_> After deleting the image, and pulling (which ocmpletes way too fast), its still obviously the old image
[03:01:41] <tabakhase> also --no-cache if thats what you actually want
[03:01:45] <sudomann_> I dont understand what you mean with "garbage collection"
[03:01:50] <tabakhase> (or/and --pull to build)
[03:02:23] <tabakhase> gbc as in https://docs.docker.com/config/pruning/
[03:03:22] <sudomann_> docker compose build utilities --no-cache
[03:03:30] <sudomann_> Thats not working ^

[03:36:15] <sudomann_> So I had to delete the manifest for my multiplatform image, create and push again. It seems the --amend flag on it does not work as advertised
[03:37:44] <sudomann_> I inspected it locally, and it had the ids of the new images I built for each platform. Yet after pushing, I would look in the container registry and see that it was just updated, but with the same old image that was already there
[03:43:44] *** Joins: cliluw (~cliluw@47.147.73.223)
[03:47:29] <programmerq> sudomann_▸ the FROM directive isn't something I'd expect --no-cache to affect. docker-compose build --pull would force it to repull any images, but I wouldn't expect --no-cache to imply --pull since not every image referred to in a FROM line is guaranteed to have been pulled in the first place.
[03:47:57] <programmerq> the buildx output might be different than the non-buildx output
[03:51:18] <sudomann_> ooh, I forgot about --pull I definitely shouldve tried that
[03:52:36] <sudomann_> Actually, that might not have worked in my case, because I deleted the multiplatform image (after pushing my supposedly amended manifest) then pulled but it turned out to still be an outdated image
[03:53:33] <sudomann_> I repeated this process after recreating the manifest, and the image pulled was the new one I desried

[03:55:41] <Hecate> I'm trying to attempt something and I don't know yet if it's an anti-pattern
[03:55:56] <Hecate> I want to provide a development environment for an application that needs a postgresql
[03:56:27] <Hecate> my first reflex is to use docker-compose with two services: the postgres itself, and a shell with the toolchain installed
[03:57:01] <Hecate> and the 2nd bind-mounts the code repo and we don't have to rebuild a docker image for each code change
[03:57:55] <Hecate> but of course, if I run 'docker-compose up', the 2nd "service" will exit instantaneously, since it doesn't actually run anything, just provides the link to the database container and installs a toolchain
[03:58:35] <Hecate> so, I'm totally open to the possibility that this is utterly misguided, but I'd like to know what's the state of the art in such situation. :)

[17:40:33] <tabakhase> deuxexmachina dont have a --rm in the run, then container&logs will remain :P --- but the more generic debugging path is to instead start the thing with a shell, and then run your commands and watch (so /bin/sh | /bin/bash as cmd-overwrite in the "docker run" - sometimes coupled with a `--entrypoint ""` to clean that out as well
[17:41:16] <deuxexmachina> ok i figured it out... same issue i was working on with ikke before, but this time i have no idea how a variable in a Dockerfile isn't getting evaluated 
[17:41:38] <deuxexmachina> ARG is working in one dockerfile and not another
[17:41:51] <deuxexmachina> their docker-compose services both have the same build context and same args:
[17:41:53] <tabakhase> VaniaPy im no pygod, but pip-freeze doesnt make much sense there
[17:42:10] <programmerq> deuxexmachina▸ when a container stops, the logs won't disappear. The default log driver is the file/json log driver and it will stick around until the container is deleted.
[17:42:26] <tabakhase> + then your bind-mount in the volumes whacks all that out with your disc-contents anyhow
[17:42:31] <programmerq> if you're doing a swarm mode service, then it'll keep the task history limit number of failed containers
[17:42:52] <programmerq> so if it's trying and failing quickly, you can get into a bit of a race condition trying to grab the logs of any one task/container.
[17:43:07] <deuxexmachina> i was assuming there were more logs, there weren't... i had the logs, but yet again it is this damn Dockerfile syntax (or something) - haven't figure it out yet
[17:43:08] <tabakhase> deuxexmachina ARG only work up until the next FROM if thats a multistage build... 
[17:43:25] <deuxexmachina> the ARG is right before the CMD

[17:52:57] <deuxexmachina> they both have identical build sections in docker-compose.yml, and identical args: therein
[17:53:08] <Tach> this is seriously annoying... my docker host is filling up it's full disk on overlay2 but all unsued images/volumes are pruned

[17:53:50] *** Joins: samgranieri (~samgranie@user/samgranieri)
[17:54:12] <deuxexmachina> the only difference is the working one does not have dockerfile: specified in build: within docker-compose.yml
[17:54:55] <tabakhase> deuxexmachina see what actually ends up in cmd via "docker inspect IMAGENAME" -- and with a cmd that smells as if you wanted that to evaluate "on runtime" - so id be ARG +  ENV + variable
[17:55:23] <deuxexmachina> I can see what does in the containers error log
[17:55:39] <deuxexmachina> Dockerfile-2 produces "npm run services-"
[17:55:44] <deuxexmachina> and $mode is nowhere to be seen
[17:56:10] <tabakhase> as said, check on inspect - logout doesnt matter
[17:56:32] <deuxexmachina> actually inspecting the images does show "npm run services-$mode"!
[17:56:54] <deuxexmachina> so I guess it is empty later at run time...

[17:59:39] <tabakhase> (think "what ARG actually can replace in the dockerfile" depends a bit on how its written, plain vs quotes vs array - not sure tho as often when you want smth like this ENV for runtime-overwrites is the correcter thing anyhow :P

WordPress then fails to start, saying it can't find the host ( https://paste.debian.net/plainh/fbc75ef1 ). Does anyone know why this would be failing?

Disabling it in .env didn't work but DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 on the command line actually worked (fixed the strange problem): "network mode "1-traefik" not supported by buildkit" (which doesn't make sense to me)

[21:52:35] <dob1> I am looking for a systemd example service to start a docker service or docker compose
[21:53:03] <dob1> it is advisable to set docker to log on journalctl in this case?
[21:54:54] *** Quits: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[21:56:06] <ada_> dob1: https://blog.container-solutions.com/running-docker-containers-with-systemd
[21:56:21] <ada_> dob1: to the second, its up to you
[21:56:55] <ada_> dob1: if you want your logs persisted into journald, that option exists.  it might break your ability to run "docker logs" and have the docker daemon emit the logs.  but if you're OK with using journalctl instead, then it's fine
[21:57:33] <dob1> ada_, it's not this, it's because with systemd logs I guarantee to have a timestamp on logs
[21:58:21] <dob1> for example now I am running an application with docker(-compose) and I don't understand the logs because there is not timestamp
[21:58:35] <ada_> docker logs --timestamps
[21:59:05] <dob1> ah!
[21:59:08] <dob1> ok :)
[22:00:56] <dob1> ada_, can I have them in localized time?
[22:00:57] <ada_> I always like to consider the problem you want to solve instead of a potential solution
[22:01:17] <dob1> xy problem I know :)
[22:01:20] <ada_> whats the problem you want to solve? what does your ideal end state look like
[22:02:32] <ada_> i don't have docker running on any of my vms rn :X hang on
[22:04:34] <ada_> dob1: no option exists to print the --timestamps in anything but GMT time
[22:04:46] <ada_> UTC rather
[22:08:17] <dob1> ada_, no problem, it's just enough
