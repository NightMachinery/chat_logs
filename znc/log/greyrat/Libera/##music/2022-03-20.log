[01:08:30] <murthy> when the sun comes up and calls up on, what will the dew drop do?
[01:09:50] <MusicalDillo> drop
[01:10:02] <morlog> poopoo
[01:10:48] <MusicalDillo> heh
[01:12:01] <morlog> tied a monkies fist knot around a 1" ball bearing
[01:12:21] <morlog> have 4 more ball bearings
[01:12:27] <morlog> thinking of making a flail
[01:12:36] <murthy> MusicalDillo, morlog, both of you wrong
[01:13:01] <morlog> im not wrong
[01:13:03] <MusicalDillo> something you learned in the Boy Scouts (not how to make a flail ;)?
[01:13:11] <morlog> was just saying poopoo
[01:13:47] <morlog> actually, I learned how to make a monkies fist on my own, it was in the boy scouts that i learned how to make a flail
[01:14:10] <morlog> boy scouts are a rowdy bunch when they are on their own
[01:14:24] <murthy> The correct answer is, it sublimes
[01:15:07] <murthy> reminds me of the fly poem
[01:15:49] <murthy> morlog: you were in boy scouts?
[01:15:52] <morlog> learned how to shoot a bow and arrow, also learned how to make a bow, learned how to shoot guns, learned how to shoot a slingshot as well as a sling, and how to throw knives and axes all in the boy scouts
[01:16:06] <morlog> till they kicked me out for being crazy
[01:16:13] <murthy> ha ha ha
[01:16:20] <morlog> for real
[01:16:29] <morlog> was too mentally unstable for them
[01:16:44] <MusicalDillo> what did you do?
[01:16:51] <morlog> im bipolar
[01:17:01] <morlog> showed signs really early on
[01:17:03] <murthy> court martialed 
[01:17:09] <MusicalDillo> My brother has that issue
[01:17:23] <MusicalDillo> It's not terribly uncommon
[01:17:37] <murthy> MusicalDillo: what you didn't know that morlog was bipolar?
[01:17:52] <MusicalDillo> Sure he had mentioned it
[01:17:55] <morlog> mine isnt treatable
[01:18:00] <murthy> morlog: also why did you mention Dillo by his name in your blog?>
[01:18:00] <morlog> i tried
[01:18:09] <MusicalDillo> I just was wondering if there was an incident with the scouts
[01:18:20] <morlog> was too wild
[01:18:57] <murthy> morlog: tell me who is your friend Valorie?
[01:19:04] <murthy> is that the kde person?
[01:19:16] <murthy> Valorie Zimmerman?
[01:19:27] <morlog> no, a good friend
[01:19:43] <murthy> oh ok
[01:19:47] <murthy> I was little bit shocked
[01:19:56] <morlog> been helping me with showers and laundry, also loaned me some money for the road
[01:20:07] <murthy> nice
[01:20:44] <morlog> get to start out with some cash in my pocket and enough food for at least a week
[01:21:09] <morlog> I'm better set up for this bike ride than I was on every other ride
[01:21:15] <morlog> seems to be a trend
[01:21:21] <morlog> last one was like that
[01:21:27] <murthy> morlog: ya read your blog

[01:25:32] <murthy> nice
[01:25:36] <morlog> if the storm has passed by then that is
[01:25:49] <morlog> supposed to be a really bad on monday night
[01:26:26] <murthy> From tomorrow my house extension construction is getting started, I will have to spend my spare time to monitor that, plus spend some time getting ready for marriage
[01:26:37] <murthy> so I won't be able to come here often
[01:26:59] <MusicalDillo> best of luck with the construction
[01:27:08] <murthy> MusicalDillo: ty
[01:27:29] <murthy> morlog: I will get to know about your journey from time to time from your blogs
[01:27:29] <MusicalDillo> and best wishes for your marriage :)
[01:27:51] <murthy> MusicalDillo: ty. I just starting to look for a partner :D
[01:27:55] <morlog> murthy: I update often when I'm on the road
[01:28:05] <murthy> MusicalDillo: but will be married by this year end
[01:28:12] <murthy> morlog: nice
[01:28:14] <morlog> lots of pictures if possible
[01:28:24] <murthy> morlog: that would be awesome
[01:28:28] <MusicalDillo> yeah good thing you didn't try to start out this weekend morlog, even though the weather is beautiful today
[01:28:47] <morlog> it will be really nice after the storm
[01:28:58] <MusicalDillo> good deal
[01:29:04] <morlog> wind will start coming from the south after about 4 days
[01:29:20] <morlog> will be coming from the west at first
[01:29:23] <MusicalDillo> done any work on a sail?
[01:29:36] <morlog> im going straight north at first so it wont be too bad
[01:29:39] <murthy> I have to go now, see you all later
[01:29:48] <MusicalDillo> au revoir murthy
[01:29:50] <murthy> you all have a nice day
[01:29:57] <morlog> I've nbeenmn looking into it here and seeing my options
[01:29:58] <murthy> MusicalDillo: you too
[01:30:05] <morlog> see ya murthy 
[01:30:13] <murthy> morlog: bye
[01:31:32] <morlog> I have one of the rainflies off one of my old tents 
[01:31:52] <morlog> its looking to be the perfect shape and size for a front sail
[01:31:56] <morlog> a winnaker
[01:32:43] <MusicalDillo> that'd be neat
[01:32:46] <morlog> have a aluminum pup tent pole that I can use with it
[01:33:20] <MusicalDillo> That'd turn some heads on the roadway 
[01:33:31] <morlog> on my first cross country bike trip i used a winnaker type front sail mountted to my front rack that was made out of a trash bag
[01:33:52] <morlog> got most of the way across colorado with it
[01:34:01] <MusicalDillo> nice
[01:34:55] <morlog> i could easily make one thats more than twice the size with the rainfly

[03:05:21] <artao> Whoa WTAF! Something is SERIOUSLY WRONG going on up in the attic space. LOUD banging, like things falling over. Many times all day, at random. ... A joist DID break several years back over a different apartment. I am LEGIT scared that's gonna happen here and come crashing down thru the ceiling. (While I sleep. Crushing me.)
[03:05:21] <artao> Workers have been up there investigating moisture issues several times recently, with no luck.
[03:05:21] <artao> This is not good. Very distressing. ... Yes, of course I've contacted the landlord, but it's freakin 6pm on a Saturday. What can they really do?
[03:05:42] <artao> it is breezy today. gusty even. but this is WAY more than simple house frame shifting or anything
[03:07:15] <efex_> artao: are you happy with the sm57 for your use?
[03:07:38] <artao> so far. i mean ....
[03:07:39] <artao> shure
[03:07:41] <artao> heh heh
[03:07:47] <artao> i haven't really /used/ it much
[03:08:01] <artao> did some test recordings to compare it to the neewer nw-700
[03:08:23] <efex_> imho a beta58a would be a better choice
[03:08:34] <efex_> 57a? I forget
[03:08:46] <artao> it's def. clearer and more open. the neewer isn't "bad." it definitely has a low-end roll off somewhere. and even maybe sounds a bit muffled at times
[03:09:04] <efex_> sorry a beta 57a
[03:09:09] <artao> but i almost like it better for vocals. kinda "warmer" .... tho a combination of the two mics together does sound quite nice too
[03:10:04] <efex_> I bought (finally) a sm57, as it is a classic snare mic. I actually returned it and much prefer the beta 57a‚Ä¶ as it is much more versitile
[03:10:16] <artao> righto
[03:10:19] <efex_> and for vocals‚Ä¶ wow so much more useable
[03:10:33] <artao> it shure does need to be mic-ed close tho. especially for vocals
[03:10:39] <artao> very low volume
[03:10:46] <efex_> I hated that
[03:11:03] <efex_> it is not designed for vocals
[03:11:11] <artao> it can be used for vocals tho
[03:11:22] <artao> nothin wrong with using it for vocals
[03:11:26] <efex_> the 58 is the live vocals moic,but it is not so useful for instruments
[03:11:34] <artao> the close micing is good for high SPL tho
[03:11:37] <efex_> your call
[03:11:44] <artao> yeah. low-end roll off on the sm58
[03:11:46] <artao> pass
[03:11:55] <artao> this is more for instruments and general sampling
[03:11:58] <efex_> yes, it is designed for high spl‚Ä¶ snafre drum and guitar cabs
[03:12:09] <artao> trumpet
[03:12:17] <efex_> the beta57a won me over at any rate
[03:12:30] <artao> it might work okay as a hand-cupped mic for harmonica even
[03:12:35] <efex_> so I thought I would mention it is all
[03:12:44] <artao> tho i also do have a Shure Green Bullet for that. the classic blues harp mic
[03:13:07] <artao> well, this is my first "real" mic. so i'll stick with it for awhile and get used to it
[03:13:08] <efex_> I have one of those old mics! a brown one
[03:13:16] <efex_> your call
[03:13:23] <artao> later i'll pick up a Neuman ribbon mic with tube
[03:13:24] <efex_> I have lots of mics
[03:13:25] <artao> heh heh
[03:13:40] <efex_> I in fact have a neumann tube mic
[03:13:46] <artao> nice
[03:13:48] <efex_> a m149
[03:14:24] <efex_> it has mutlti patterns but otherwise I find similar to the TLM103  (my other neumann)
[03:14:46] <artao> i have an electret condenser (the neewer nw700), this (sm57) dynamic mic .. and whatever the Green Bullet is. IDR
[03:15:00] <artao> now i need a ribbon mic and a "regular" condenser mic
[03:15:05] <efex_> I like condensor s much more than dynamics but they all have their uses
[03:15:19] <artao> i don't have enuf experience to have an opinion
[03:15:51] <efex_> well..imho‚Ä¶ for now skip the ribbon‚Ä¶ again your call. There are tons of cheap condensors now tho!

[03:17:12] <artao> the suckiest thing about it tho is that it's omnidirectional. SUPER easy to feedback if you point it the wrong way lol
[03:17:36] <artao> i already have a cheap condenser
[03:17:37] <artao> ;)
[03:17:50] <artao> 100usd+ would be the next step

[03:18:16] <efex_> that‚Äôs still cheap tho..

[03:18:41] <efex_> (fine my be if they work!!)
[03:18:57] <efex_> err fine By me)
[03:19:06] <artao> cheap to some
[03:19:34] <efex_> condensors need 48v phantom power, I assume your preamp has that?
[03:20:11] <efex_> cheap in the marketplace area, I mean.. not to anybody in particular
[03:20:37] <artao> yes. both do
[03:20:44] <artao> mixer and audio interface
[03:21:14] <artao> behringer xenyx 1002B and focusrite scarlett 2i4 2nd gen
[03:21:21] <artao> before you ask ;]
[03:21:39] <efex_> the focusrite is cheap and great
[03:23:06] <efex_> be careful with the power input on the behringer tho
[03:23:58] <artao> eh?
[03:24:04] <artao> how do you mean
[03:24:11] <artao> i actually once had a scare that it had died
[03:24:18] <efex_> where the power enters the back of the device
[03:24:21] <artao> however, it turned out the power strip was turned off
[03:24:23] <artao> d'oh
[03:24:30] <artao> OH the power
[03:24:52] <artao> By the Power of Greyskull !! \o/_
[03:25:06] <artao> yes, of course. what about it? known to fail?
[03:25:12] <efex_> the connector is soldered to the circuitboard and is super cheap, vs being a connector on the chassis
[03:25:14] <artao> its nice it can run on batteries too
[03:25:22] <artao> ah. fair nuf
[03:25:27] <efex_> yes
[03:25:30] <artao> i could possibly sturdy that up a bit
[03:25:38] <artao> *probably
[03:25:49] <artao> same with the headphone input on the audio interface
[03:25:52] <efex_> su really given you have it just be super careful :-)
[03:26:12] <efex_> the focusrite should be fine
[03:26:14] <artao> it got knocked sideways too much and now i gotta sometimes wiggle it to get both headphones to work
[03:26:25] <artao> careful? nahh. epoxy
[03:26:26] <artao> :)
[03:26:27] <artao> heh heh
[03:26:37] <artao> SAY!
[03:26:40] <artao> you know mics!!
[03:27:15] <artao> So my Green Bullet. I has a bit of a sporadic short at the base of it where the wires enter the housing
[03:27:46] <artao> There's a spring there for support, and that's removable -- but it requires a RIDICULOUSLY tiny allen wrench. Like ... 0.05um
[03:28:02] <artao> heh. but no, really. like no more than 0.5mm
[03:28:45] <artao> And from the inside .. WELL ................... The entire cable-entrance at the bottom of the mic is filled with what I assume is fucking hot glue
[03:29:06] <MusicalDillo> artao> behringer xenyx << /me uses a Behringer Xenyx QX1622USB.  Has lots of good features
[03:29:13] <artao> So how the FUCK do i get in there to fix the gorram wire. I know I'm 100% capable of such a simple fix  -- if only I could get at the problem
[03:29:27] <artao> nice. that has fx ja?
[03:29:27] <morlog> artao that might be nylon
[03:29:35] <artao> and more busses
[03:29:41] <artao> nylon .... glue?
[03:29:42] <artao> o.O
[03:29:43] <artao> dafuq
[03:29:58] <artao> Well .... a) WTF WHY?
[03:30:04] <morlog> no, a mylon insert
[03:30:08] <morlog> nylon
[03:30:11] <MusicalDillo> artao> nice. that has fx ja? << Yes, 24-bit
[03:30:13] <artao> b) How the fuck do I get it out without damaging the mic element and stuff
[03:30:32] <morlog> is it a ribbon mic
[03:30:33] <MusicalDillo> Lots of good features in a relatively small package
[03:30:45] <artao> just clip the wires to the element and put those back later?
[03:30:54] <artao> morlog no. dynamic. Shure Green Bullet
[03:30:59] <morlog> dynamic mics hace a capsuke inside the housing thats self contained
[03:31:07] <morlog> capsule
[03:31:11] <morlog> its protected
[03:31:11] <MusicalDillo> from what I've heard, ribbon mics and phantom power do not mix at all well
[03:31:19] <artao> yes. but it's wrired to the cable running out of the mic
[03:31:31] <artao> the Green Bullet has a built-in cable. 1/4" TS
[03:31:38] <artao> which is the problem
[03:31:40] <efex_> artao: I just handed the great tech I know the mic.. and he fixed the wire
[03:31:45] <artao> where it enters the housing
[03:32:02] <morlog> little metal cylinder with 3 prongs on one end and black felt or screen on the other
[03:32:04] <artao> well ..... i'm in poverty, so i have to be my own tech
[03:32:10] <artao> plus it's just good to know how to do
[03:32:24] <morlog> pretty straight forward
[03:32:30] <artao> i looked inside the new SM57 too and sure enuf, buncha glue in the base of that one too
[03:32:34] <artao> jerks
[03:32:34] <efex_> so  ‚Äúi don't have enuf experience to have an opinion‚Äù‚Äù ehehe
[03:33:11] <morlog> if its hot glue just put the mic in a ziplock and let it sit in hot water, that will loosen it up
[03:33:12] <artao> eh? o.O
[03:33:26] <artao> if only i had a hot air gun
[03:33:34] <morlog> that would be messy
[03:33:34] <artao> ^ that just occurred to me
[03:33:50] <morlog> hot water also removes super glue
[03:34:15] <artao> um .... no it doesn't .... you need acetone
[03:34:28] <artao> twisting will break the bond tho
[03:34:39] <artao> it has terrible torsional strength. quite brittle
[03:34:45] <artao> also weak to sudden jarring
[03:35:01] <morlog> real super glue was originally made for the battlefield as a liquid suture, its water soluble
[03:35:25] <artao> Fun Fact: In freestyle frisbee we use superglue to put on our fake fingernails
[03:35:49] <artao> well ... not so much "made" for. but moreso "discovered"
[03:35:57] <morlog> and why do you wear fake fingernails for freestyle frisbee
[03:36:14] <artao> don't use general store-bought superglue to close wounds, except in serious emergencies
[03:36:21] <artao> it contains other shit that's not good
[03:36:29] <artao> get medical grade superglue
[03:36:32] <morlog> it works
[03:36:36] <artao> cyanoacrylate
[03:36:44] <morlog> you get the cheap stuff
[03:36:52] <artao> the plastic is slippery with the frisbee
[03:36:59] <morlog> doesnt have the additave drying agents
[03:37:09] <artao> we also spray the frisbee and nails down with silicone or teflon
[03:37:29] <morlog> spray them with pam and dont tell anyone
[03:37:40] <artao> oh no. i get the high end professional/hobby-grade cyanoacrylate
[03:37:49] <artao> pam would be terrible. greasy

[03:42:21] <artao> Important Note: Cyanoacrylate reacts VERY exothermically with cotton. Don't spill it on a t-shirt you're wearing. Trust me. OW .. hot enuf potentially for minor burns.

[03:51:24] <artao> i suspect a difference in the the form of the cotton. cotton fabric vs fluffed cotton

[03:56:12] * MusicalDillo built some Estes rockets back in the 60s
[03:56:36] <MusicalDillo> I'll bet there have been some improvements ;)
[03:57:09] <artao> that can record many parameters as well as trigger numerous events based either/both on time and/or triggers from the flight parameters
[03:57:13] <MusicalDillo> Hey, is Elon can land re-usable booster rockets on a platform in the ocean anything's possible
[03:57:20] <artao> crazy stuff. and not all that pricey
[03:57:21] <MusicalDillo> *if Elon
[03:57:33] <MusicalDillo> that's cool artao
[03:57:34] <artao> model rocketry is a pretty affordable hobby until you get into the higher power ones
[03:57:44] <artao> up to D or E is decent
[03:58:16] <artao> I used to do model rockets a bit as a kid -- but couldn't really afford the engines so that quickly died out
[03:59:04] <artao> then in .. 2001? ........ Spaceship One went up and was live streamed .. and Estes was one of the sponsors
[03:59:21] <artao> so i became a BAR -- Born Again Rocketeer LOL
[04:00:08] <MusicalDillo> They're moving the new Moon rocket to its launch pad
[04:00:13] <artao> i just DLed some free rocket design software and grabbed a bunch of scrap tubes and carefully measured 'em all up with a micrometer and input "the stuff i had" into the software and designed one
[04:00:22] <MusicalDillo> for testing
[04:00:22] <artao> it went up a good 1000 ft, easy
[04:00:28] <artao> i called it the Ion
[04:00:35] <artao> idk if i have any pics up
[04:00:39] <MusicalDillo> kewl
[04:00:45] <artao> it has, of course, been long lost
[04:01:26] <artao> MusicalDillo> Hey, is Elon can land re-usable booster rockets on a platform in the ocean anything's possible
[04:01:36] <artao> sure. but miniaturizing such is a bit harder eh ;)
[04:01:42] <MusicalDillo> true
[04:02:11] <MusicalDillo> but dealing with the same physics
[04:02:34] <MusicalDillo> Have you seen the old movie Flight Of The Phoenix?
[04:03:37] <MusicalDillo> some people stranded in a plane crashed in the desert rebuild it according to principles designed by a passenger who engineered model airplanes
[04:04:01] <artao> aye
[04:04:09] <artao> not in quite awhile tho
[04:04:26] <artao> yeah. the aerodynamics still totally apply

[04:07:13] <artao> as in: have to get "licensed," and have to get clearance with the FAA and file a flight plan and everything
[04:07:32] <artao> *certified . that's the word
[04:07:37] <artao> and there's 3 levels of cert
[04:07:44] <MusicalDillo> They made it so that the fins drop off?

[04:09:20] <artao> i've not been able to find it again, but i saw a follow-up video talking about what happened .. Altho the fins LOOKED just fine after that flight, they were in fact ready to shatter at any moment due to being riddled with microfractures from that flight even.

[04:33:11] <MusicalDillo> the main one is a MIDI Time Piece A/V
[04:33:29] <MusicalDillo> it's a bit finiky 
[04:34:04] <MusicalDillo> also a couple of their FastLanes
[04:34:51] <efex_> I had a few of those that I got free, but already had interfaces
[04:35:10] <efex_> I have a little 5 port motu tho.. great
[04:35:10] <MusicalDillo> MTP = 8x8 w/ 256 MIDI channels
[04:35:17] <efex_> yeah
[04:35:29] <efex_> Emagic Uniitors here
[04:35:34] <efex_> Unitors
[04:35:48] <efex_> Opcodes before.. recall those?
[04:36:09] <MusicalDillo> I do recall OpCode.  I was using Performer at the time
[04:37:22] <efex_> I hated performer as it had no piano roll
[04:37:30] <MusicalDillo> Bill Payne's (Little Feat) solo album was done on a Mac SE with Opcode
[04:37:37] <efex_> but I had to use it at the studio I was with at the time
[04:37:40] <MusicalDillo> They added it later
[04:38:02] <MusicalDillo> and then digital audio by Performer 6
[04:38:50] <efex_> yes I know
[04:39:13] <MusicalDillo> did early opcode have 480PPQ?
[04:39:16] <efex_> but there as well I was on digital audio I think 4 years before they got there
[04:39:28] <efex_> I forget
[04:39:53] <efex_> Notator Logic did but it was Atari only at the time
[04:40:35] <MusicalDillo> as I recall, Ataris had built-in MIDI interfaces
[04:40:55] <efex_> yes
[04:41:32] <efex_> while Bill southworth introduced multiports in 86 with his rack interface
[04:41:41] <efex_> I still have it!
[04:42:01] <MusicalDillo> nice
[04:43:11] <efex_> shame he went bankrupt.. trying to make an audio card for his sequencer Total Music‚Ä¶ recall it
[04:43:42] <efex_> 1985 the arerival of the piano roll, scoring etc.. and of course the mouse and windows
[04:43:52] <efex_> with the Mac 128
[04:44:21] <MusicalDillo> from what I remember they had some great module designs, but Total Music was a buggy mess when Performer was stable and had 480PPQ resolution to boot
[04:45:08] <efex_> yes!
[04:45:14] <MusicalDillo> my first MIDI computer was a SX-64 (C-64 portable) with Sonus SuperSequencer in 1985
[04:45:36] <efex_> so I had to use it at work in 87-89
[04:45:45] <MusicalDillo> but then I upgraded to a 'Fat Mac' (512k) with Performer
[04:45:53] <efex_> but 1990 Vison and digital audio arrived
[04:46:29] <efex_> I had the first Sound Tools system in western Canada (my friend had it on atari)
[04:46:32] <MusicalDillo> OpCode Vision with a Mac SE was what Bill Payne used to make his solo album
[04:46:42] <efex_> so suddenly I was GOD of editing
[04:46:43] <MusicalDillo> nice
[04:46:50] <MusicalDillo> haha I'll bet
[04:46:58] <MusicalDillo> You're in Van?
[04:47:10] <efex_> yeah I loved vision, but I eventually had to swithc to logic as vision got too buggy
[04:47:37] <efex_> I was in Edmonton.. now Van Island yay escaped Van. 
[04:47:46] <MusicalDillo> haha
[04:47:57] <MusicalDillo> have a friend in North Van who really likes it there
[04:48:07] <efex_> it was a great place to be for work

[04:51:52] <efex_> one climate marker event kocked out the highways here in 200 places in a single day
[04:52:01] <MusicalDillo> ?
[04:52:25] <efex_> then the top temperature ever recorded went ujp 7 degrees, massive fires
[04:52:28] <morlog> rising tides
[04:52:35] <efex_> a whole town burned
[04:52:53] <morlog> the warmer the tundra gets the more CO2 thats released

[04:53:00] <efex_> yes
[04:53:14] <morlog> all that carbon trapped away in the ice
[04:53:21] <MusicalDillo> efex_> a whole town burned << I read about that happening to a town in BC
[04:53:32] <morlog> yall get any craters like siberia
[04:53:32] <efex_> being on the water, rising sea level is a real world concern for me
[04:54:03] <MusicalDillo> but think of the surfboard sales potential

[04:54:21] <morlog> yeah
[04:54:35] <MusicalDillo> Waterworld has some good moments
[04:54:45] <efex_> MusicalDillo: yes‚Ä¶ but the fossil fuel companies have the right wing politicians in their pocket, and have had 40 years of anti-science propaganda to keep the general public happy
[04:55:01] <morlog> they have both sides in their pockets

[05:02:48] <efex_> mine was a 3.2 but it had midi..?
[05:02:55] <MusicalDillo> 3.3 was MIDI
[05:03:03] <MusicalDillo> unless it was retrofitted
[05:03:06] <efex_> then 3.3
[05:03:17] <efex_> I think factory
[05:03:21] <MusicalDillo> yeah that's a rare bird for sure
[05:03:51] <efex_> I was happy to see it go to a good home

[05:11:59] <MusicalDillo> and I can access that with the computer via MIDi Quest rather than scrolling through menus

[05:14:26] <MusicalDillo> you bet
[05:14:31] <artao> and patch cables. and blinky lights. and buttons
[05:14:54] <artao> incidentally, my Moog System 55+ is the Arturia emulation ;p
[05:14:56] <artao> obviously
[05:14:57] <MusicalDillo> no patch cables
[05:14:57] <efex_> blinkies!!!
[05:15:20] <MusicalDillo> yes, lots of blinking lights :)
[05:15:32] <efex_> ooooh
[05:15:51] <MusicalDillo> I have synths with many 'virtual patch cables'

[05:16:40] <artao> speaking of accessing parameters via computer ..... with the Modal CraftSynth you can plug it USB into your tablet and not only power it off the tablet but run an app on the tablet to control its parameters on the nice touch screen all nice laid out. No shift- or alt-functions
[05:16:54] <efex_> I more and more am a musician and less a synthesist
[05:16:58] <artao> and it'll run for a good while off a full tablet charge
[05:17:05] <artao> nice little unit, the CraftSynth
[05:17:11] <efex_> thst‚Äôs pretty fine!
[05:17:13] <MusicalDillo> amazing what they're offering for tablets these days, including people like Moog
[05:17:18] <artao> have y'all seen I Dream Of Wires
[05:17:26] <MusicalDillo> I have not
[05:17:36] <artao> touch interface is /almost/ like grabbing knobs and shit
[05:17:38] <artao> almost
[05:17:43] <MusicalDillo> kewl
[05:17:53] <artao> just missing the feedback
[05:18:03] <artao> which i'm sure will cum
[05:18:04] <morlog> i want to get a "Spaceball's The Sticker" sticker
[05:18:07] <MusicalDillo> but I can do that with my mouse and MIDi Quest
[05:18:15] <artao> soon enuf. it's even breathing hard
[05:18:26] <MusicalDillo> a replication of the control surface
[05:18:49] <efex_> My idea of a touch interface is a Seaboard
[05:18:56] <artao> in a performance for instance MusicalDillo ... just use the tablet and power the little synth and control it with the tablet just propped up on or near it
[05:19:11] <MusicalDillo> sounds neat
[05:19:18] <artao> also 100% easily portable. even in just a pair of nice cargo pants
[05:19:19] <artao> heh
[05:19:26] <morlog> thats what she said
[05:19:29] <artao> and only 150usd. very nice deal for a Modal synth
[05:19:30] <MusicalDillo> haha
[05:19:33] <artao> which are generally $$$$
[05:19:45] <MusicalDillo> a 'cargo pants studio'?
[05:20:18] <artao> wavetable synth with numerous cross-modulation methods. 64(?) wavetables? no ... yes?
[05:20:46] <MusicalDillo> je ne sais pas
[05:21:03] <artao> at any rate ... 16 oscillators in two "banks" so to speak. two "sound sources" each with 8 oscillators. which can just be stacked OR detuned to various degrees, including chords
[05:21:11] <morlog> i have a dev board that will let me turn banana's into a keyboard
[05:21:19] <artao> fun

[05:31:02] <artao> purpose-sold as such under the brand name Zyban as a quit smoking med
[05:32:34] <artao> also as an anti-depressant, as Lamictol
[05:32:56] <artao> it was originally for depression, but then prescribers kept having patients also quit nicotine
[05:33:23] <artao> turns out that not only is it a dopamine and norepinephrine agonist, it's a nicotine antagonist

[05:33:45] <artao> fuckin pharmacology amirite
[05:34:34] <artao> another like that is hydroxyzine: prescription antihistamine ..... can also be effective for anti-anxiety (rapid acting)  and sleep help (slow acting)
[05:35:01] <artao> one prescription warning is the typical "may make you drowsy don't operate heavy machinery"
[05:35:02] <artao> WELL
[05:35:22] <artao> useful. after about 2 hrs i get pretty sleepy. and for anxiety it works in like 15-20 min
[05:35:59] <artao> best of all? unlike on-label anti-anxiety and sleep meds, you don't develop a tolerance and it's non-addictive and non-habit forming
[05:36:07] <artao> .... barring people pre-disposed to such
[05:36:22] <artao> however! for some people .... they don't get along. 
[05:36:26] <artao> it can cause intense dreams
[05:36:35] <artao> long sleep periods. 10+ hrs
[05:37:04] <artao> i take 50mg/ea up to 4x day

[05:42:15] <artao> on .... re: the hydroxyzine being a prescription antihistamine .... if you get a cold or something stuffy head/lungs .... works pretty well to clear it up
[05:42:18] <artao> pro tip
[05:42:49] <artao> Fun Fact: The longer an epoxy takes to cure the stronger it is

[14:38:30] <Rashad> I am a public servant, I do not answer to my boss, manager, even to the head of government -- I answer to the public. There is no personal interest in what I do not for me nor for my boss or anyone else. 
[14:39:02] <Rashad> It's completely my choice whether to serve the public or not
[14:39:37] <Rashad> And people have done this before... the head of IT left a year or so ago to work in the gulf and he got the job through people we were working with.
