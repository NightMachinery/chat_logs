[05:36:41] <GinFuyou> Your paste has different error
[05:36:53] <GinFuyou> anyway, don't use pickle
[05:38:26] <chiz> apologies, https://dpaste.org/JVgo
[05:39:31] <chiz> This is with the django module for q_cluster. I'm unaware of using pickle anywhere
[05:40:43] <GinFuyou> I have no idea about this lib, but usually task queue needs a serialization format to send messages\task arguments
[05:40:56] <GinFuyou> and it can default to pickle
[05:41:14] <GinFuyou> You don't want anyway. (use json or yaml)

[06:18:36] <karunamon> hi folks - having a slightly hard time understanding the custom field docs. I've got a field which is a string in the database, but which could be convertible to a python int. I've got a method on that model now with the try/except logic to make that happen, but it looks like I could use a custom field type to simplify things. Not sure exactly what I need to be looking at,
[06:23:57] <karunamon> tl;dr: a User.id should be exposed as an Int if it can be converted, otherwise it should show as a string.

[17:19:49] <hEXE90> I have a model that has been previously annotated using specific column names. I decided to create proper fields for these annotations in the original model. When running makemigrations + migrate, fields with the same column name did not get migrated to the db table... After commenting out my old code that annotated these fields and restarting
[17:19:49] <hEXE90> apache2, my templates can still reference the previously annotated virtual columns (now commented out). Is there some temporary table containing these values?
[17:23:25] <shangxiao> hEXE90: without specific knowledge of your code, no there's no temporary table.
[17:24:22] <hEXE90> Any ideas why adding new fields to a model that have the same column name as previously annotated column names might not get picked up by makemigrations?
[17:24:49] <shangxiao> hEXE90: can you confirm what the newly generated migration did add?
[17:25:01] <shangxiao> ie open the new migration file
[17:25:16] <hEXE90> "No changes detected"
[17:26:10] <hEXE90> No new migration was generated as no changes were detected
[17:26:49] <shangxiao> when you originally ran makemigrations, it said "No changes detected" ?
[17:27:03] <hEXE90> Correct, after multiple fields were added to the model
[17:27:44] <shangxiao> that could indicate that the django "app" isn't added to INSTALLED_APPS
[17:27:56] <hEXE90> It is installed
[17:28:19] <hEXE90> I have since renamed these fields to slight changes, all of which have been picked up by makemigrations
[17:28:45] <hEXE90> only column names that collided with previously annotated columns slip past makemigrations
[17:29:33] <shangxiao> ok, not sure what's happening there but the migrations state doesn't look at queryset annotations :)
[17:29:37] *** Joins: rpkilby (~rpkilby@c-24-20-208-106.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[17:29:46] <shangxiao> at allâ€¦Â it only looks at model state
[17:29:52] <hEXE90> and more alarmingly, the code annotating these columns is now completely commented out, and yet I can still call them in templates
[17:30:13] <GinFuyou> then it's probably already migrated
[17:30:35] <GinFuyou> or you are running different code than one you think you do
[17:30:52] <hEXE90> those fields are not migrated. they do not exist in the db either under psql
[17:31:10] <shangxiao> hEXE90: I think you might need to start pasting some code on dpaste.de â€¦Â otherwise we'd just be guessing
[17:31:24] <hEXE90> I'm not sure what to paste to be honest
[17:31:30] <hEXE90> old migrations?
[17:31:57] <shangxiao> old/current models (relevant fields only), migrations generated, template code
[17:32:15] <shangxiao> sometimes also helpful is the `showmigrations` command from django-extensions
[17:32:40] <hEXE90> I've just grepped all migrations/*.py for the field names, nothing.
[17:33:33] <dodo> hEXE90: grep -i ?
[17:34:23] <hEXE90> confirmed^, not case sensitive
[17:34:41] <hEXE90> I'll put together a dpaste, but I'm not sure what to include, there's nothing here that's kind of the point
[17:35:48] <dodo> fwiw, i'd check the raw sql queries first
[17:36:41] <hEXE90> that's what I've been wondering as well, seems like a sql thing
[17:37:07] <hEXE90> I cannot select them directly from the model's table
[17:38:08] <dodo> but does the orm query? if it's not from the db it must come from some code
[17:38:17] <dodo> do you have custom managers/querysets?
[17:38:35] <hEXE90> let me see if I can call them in a manage.py shell
[17:44:25] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)
[17:44:38] <shangxiao> an unsolicited tip: django-extensions also has a shell_plus command that autoimports all your models
[17:45:04] <hEXE90> https://dpaste.org/TKiH
[17:45:08] <withered_wolf> @shangxiao that's a great tip!
[17:45:08] <shangxiao> extensions is one of the first things I do on any new Django project :D
[17:45:31] <withered_wolf> I also love the 'show_urls' functionality for when you're really in the weeds and want to make sure something exists.
[17:45:35] <hEXE90> shangxiao: I will totally check that out, thanks. have a script I use to build my shell currently
[17:46:21] <hEXE90> ah, I forgot to include code on the template and views.py that its calling
[17:46:33] <shangxiao> yup show_urls has helped me a tonne of times too
[17:49:18] <hEXE90> https://dpaste.org/9rvF#L18 updated to include template call
[17:50:19] <hEXE90> after restarting apache2, my template is still successfully calling the annotated values that have now been removed. new_field is NOT in the model and has been renamed to field_new to be picked up by makemigrations
[17:51:00] <hEXE90> and its not locally cached, actively changing data which is still updating

[18:00:06] <hEXE90> updated: https://dpaste.org/yZ0G#L18
[18:00:53] <shangxiao> yep so templates have this shortcut, where they'll happily execute model methods by just referencing the method name without the parentheses

[18:05:39] <hEXE90> so to be clear, makemigrations did not pick up the new field because it already had a model function with the same name. makes sense

[18:07:48] <withered_wolf> If you're using DRF and using a HyperLinkedModelSerializer, do you have to have a serializer for every FK'd model?

[22:20:30] <frat3rius> shangxiao I mean this code doesn't work (uses default db, when my db router should point that model to archive db): https://dpaste.org/HbNu and I need to add using("archive") for it to work like that: https://dpaste.org/mRCi
