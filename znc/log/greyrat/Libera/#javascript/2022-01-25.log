[00:09:23] <eXtr3m0> stenno regarding my question earlier with Object.keys/Object.values/Object.entries. I figured I just need all three information pieces (order/key/value) so often that it makes sense to create two different data structures. One for the order and one for the values.
[00:10:49] <stenno> the order of keys in the object is relevant?
[00:10:56] <stenno> then you are doing something wrong
[00:11:30] <eXtr3m0> Nope I got an array with each field containing an object with one key and one value
[00:11:49] <eXtr3m0> Now I thought I create one array for the order and one separate object for the values.

[00:16:46] <onosendi> adsc: maybe something like: https://gist.github.com/onosendi/509e387003b59d2f3fdfba75c3dfd2da
[00:17:23] <stenno> velix: probably not anymore
[00:17:28] <onosendi> systemfault most likely has a better way :P
[00:17:57] <stenno> ##freelancers and #css-lance are the freelancing channels on libera
[00:20:38] <systemfault> onosendi: It's not super functional because of mutations... but if I was to write it myself, I'd write it low-level with a for loop and mutations
[00:21:18] <onosendi> systemfault: any particular reason why?
[00:21:23] <onosendi> systemfault: thanks for the info, btw.
[00:21:55] <systemfault> I see groupBy as a helper function I would reuse so I would optimize it
[00:22:33] <systemfault> Like Rich Hickey (the Clojure guy) said... "If a tree falls in the woods, does it make a sound? If a pure function mutates some local data in order to produce an immutable return value, is that ok?"
[00:22:57] <onosendi> Hmm, interesting.
[00:23:27] <stenno> did that inspire immer
[00:23:40] <systemfault> I wouldn't encourage that approach for "normal code", only what I believe to be "library code"... like a groupBy function
[00:24:08] <systemfault> If Array#map didn't exist... I'd write my own using a loop, definitely not recursion
[00:24:31] <systemfault> But as long as my implementation doesn't mutation the input...
[00:24:36] <stenno> recursion would probably lead to constant stack overflows
[00:24:40] <systemfault> Yup

[06:52:03] <systemfault> For sure :)

[07:14:44] <bobdobbs> This is the most programming progress I've made in years
[07:15:38] <Rockwood> is axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;  equal to Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true for fetch?
[07:16:03] <systemfault> bobdobbs: One step at a time, you're progressing well.
[07:16:17] <bobdobbs> systemfault: thanks :)
[07:16:42] <Rockwood> fetch(url,{

[07:33:50] <b0nn> I have this code https://bpa.st/TPWA
[07:34:28] <b0nn> and some data comes back from the server, but that function throws an exception because data is null
[07:34:55] <b0nn> and I don't understand why data is null, or how to troubleshoot it
[07:34:57] <systemfault> Using console.log would probably help more than that alert()
[07:35:05] <b0nn> sure
[07:35:15] <systemfault> See what's inside the data variable before it gets to the if
[07:35:26] <b0nn> It's null

[07:35:52] <b0nn> alert(data) said "null"
[07:35:59] <systemfault> That's with curl?
[07:36:18] <b0nn> no, that's the page javascript
[07:36:21] <systemfault> That's the part I'm confused...
[07:36:25] <systemfault> And with curl it works?
[07:36:37] <jaawerth> that doesn't look like any native http api... based on the shape of the callsa nd the letter A I'm assuming axios. but axios shouldn't resolve to null either unles there's an interceptor pipeline in there somewhere I would try to set up a reproducible snippet on jsfiddle or repl.it
[07:36:46] <b0nn> with curl I get {"status":"error","error":"jhgadskfja"}
[07:37:07] <b0nn> jaawerth: oh, mithril?
[07:37:15] <jaawerth> it's mithril?
[07:37:21] <b0nn> yes
[07:37:25] <b0nn> I think so

[07:38:18] <jaawerth> I'm not familiar with whatever mithril uses for an http client but it still sounds wierd for it to resolve to null. I'm guessing there's some userland code in there mucking up the works
[07:38:19] <b0nn> A is some Authorisation check
[07:40:00] <jaawerth> I see - in that case something earlier in the promise chain created by A.request has to be returning null
[07:40:17] *** Joins: pluri (~pluri@user/pluri)

[07:42:07] <oscurochu> bobdobbs classes are good because they can help you learn how to organize your react app. but in general, they get in the way and eventually i recommend you just throw them all away.
[07:43:27] <oscurochu> bobdobbs im sure someone out there has a really good use case for classes but i go out of my way to _not_ use classes. classes were the original react way. functions were the sugar for react imo

[12:00:13] <deniska> foo++ feels way too much like C pointer hackery
[12:00:29] <corwin> deniska: I think that's more or less the consensus view, I just don't agree.
[12:01:13] <thomas25> deniska i prefer += in normal flow of the code as well but i++ is simply more conventional and easier to read in a loop
[12:01:16] <deniska> 0 and 1 are two hardcoded constants I'm typically fine with :)
[12:01:41] <deniska> thomas25: in a C-style for-loop? Yeah, I put i++ there

[12:01:58] <thomas25> yeah airbnb eslint rule does not want that
[12:02:27] <thomas25> yeah, i try to avoid them in JS as well (even though iirc, they are more performant than modern counterparts .forEach etc)
[12:03:01] <thomas25> but in some cases c style loops are also just the right tool for the job

[23:15:47] <linearbit> Basically I'm trying to remove any newlines that are entered in any way
[23:16:13] <systemfault> linearbit: I can't remember, can you event.preventDefault() with beforeinput?
[23:17:18] <linearbit> systemfault, according to MDN it's cancelable yes
[23:17:45] <systemfault> Then maybe just do that when the char is a new line
[23:18:09] <linearbit> Well the issue is that there are multiple ways in which newlines could be entered
[23:18:20] <linearbit> including paste where I'd want to still paste something, just remove the newline
[23:18:52] <linearbit> and then it might also be possible to insert multiple characters at once in other ways using e.g. IME or a macro
[23:19:05] <systemfault> Oh, right... hmm

[23:49:56] *** Joins: wombawomba (~andre@89-253-80-164.customers.ownit.se)
[23:54:03] <linearbit> stenno, then I have to figure out how to prevent newlines again
[23:54:22] <wombawomba> I'm trying to use an ECMAscript module that has a few CommonJS dependencies in an environment that doesn't support CommonJS modules. Is there some tool I can use to inline these CommonJS dependencies into the .mjs file?
[23:54:27] <stenno> what exactly do you mean with that? you want to prevent someone from pressing enter?
[23:54:36] <stenno> wombawomba: webpack ?
[23:54:48] <linearbit> stenno, if only it was that simple
[23:54:51] <ljharb> wombawomba: everything supports CJS modules
[23:54:56] <ljharb> wombawomba: use a non-broken module bundler.
[23:54:59] <linearbit> No, I'm just trying to prevent newlines in the input field
[23:55:11] <ljharb> linearbit: you can't
[23:55:13] <linearbit> which can be input in many different ways other than enter
[23:55:13] <stenno> linearbit: ok i have no clue why you want to 'prevent newlines' in a textarea
[23:55:15] <ljharb> linearbit: you do serverside validaiton
[23:55:18] <wombawomba> ljharb: I'm using GraalVM
[23:55:34] <linearbit> stenno, well I'm using an input but you recommended textarea
[23:55:35] <stenno> strip on client side, validate on server side
[23:55:40] <stenno> linearbit: yes.
[23:55:43] <wombawomba> it has 'experimental' support for CJS modules, but it doesn't seem to work in practice
[23:55:44] <linearbit> ofc I'll validate on server side
[23:55:46] <stenno> WHY do you want to 'prevent' newlines
[23:55:52] <stenno> on the client side
[23:55:57] <linearbit> because the element would resize with newlines
[23:56:03] <linearbit> which looks awful

[23:56:22] <linearbit> Now an input would be the most fitting but can't dynamically resize
[23:56:27] <ox1eef> you can give a textarea a fixed height, and scroll bars are used
[23:56:27] <wombawomba> stenno: how would I configure webpack to do this?
[23:56:40] <stenno> linearbit: even with resize: none?
[23:56:43] <stenno> ???
[23:56:52] <stenno> so you want it to dynamically resize or not
[23:57:26] <linearbit> I mean I want it to resize with its content - but only horizontally
[23:57:27] <wombawomba> just pointing webpack at the .mjs file doesn't seem to work — it seems to remove almost all the code
[23:58:01] <linearbit> ofc I could fix the height resulting in scroll bars
[23:58:05] <stenno> linearbit: so `resize: horizontal` ?
[23:58:10] <stenno> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resize
[23:58:36] <linearbit> I'm pretty sure resize will still allow newlines though, just add scroll bars, right?
[23:58:54] <stenno> not if you set overflow
[23:59:46] <linearbit> yeah but with hidden overflow the text will still be there, right?
[23:59:53] <stenno> ok you lost me
[23:59:53] <linearbit> which would be very confusing for a user
