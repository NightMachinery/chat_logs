The hooked mode gets successfully launched with the other mode but... in a buffer in the background. Calling the mode interactively with M-x spawns the buffer correctly in its intended place. It's as if the hook doesn't care about my display-buffer-alist rules. Uhh... help? ;)

[04:09:13] <JordiGH> actually, I'm kind of curious why the BSDs haven't made their own anti-GPL git.
[04:09:24] <JordiGH> They really hated gcc for the GPL, right?
[04:09:30] <JordiGH> Why haven't they expressed similar hatred for git?
[04:09:39] <Catie> FreeBSD actually just switched over to git from subversion, to make it even more confusing

[08:34:50] <zebrag> How do I open a bug on that?
[08:35:49] <gnoo> that seems like a very specific use case. specially on which whitespace character should the linebreak occur on

[08:38:48] <zebrag> and no the linebreak should not occur on a whitespace in this case
[08:39:50] <gnoo> if you don't want visual linebreak on whitespace, then setting word-wrap to nil seems like a fine choice, no?

[11:54:30] <nosystemd> doom-acario-dark is so good but
[11:54:32] <nosystemd> but
[11:54:47] <nosystemd> it is not completely black
[11:55:29] <nosystemd> while  doom-homage is very dull but it is completely black
[11:55:36] <puffybuf> that's easy just make your font black, background black, and mouse cursor black
[11:56:03] <puffybuf> how do you use themes btw? what package?
[11:56:56] <nosystemd> i use doom emacs

[11:57:16] <nosystemd> that doom homage is fine,but just those codes looks so dull
[11:57:34] <puffybuf> I see doom modeline package and doom-themes
[11:57:43] <nosystemd> is there any hack i can put that code completion highlight like that doom-acario-light ,modus does
[11:57:55] <nosystemd> inside that  doom-homage-black
[11:58:04] <nosystemd> yes i think it is doom-themes prepackaged
[12:00:14] <puffybuf> what's the 'best' modeline package?
[12:01:09] <puffybuf> I'm using simple modeline it looks pretty good but
[12:01:14] <nosystemd> i see there are
[12:01:15] <nosystemd> doom-modeline
[12:01:20] <nosystemd> but just plain would be fine , not using any modeline
[12:01:38] <nosystemd> for project name adding it in titlebar

[17:16:39] <thblt> In fairness I don't expect the new Advantage firmware to even get close to QMK's coolness. But the hardware build looks *amazing*. 
[17:16:58] <treflip> thblt:  the only reason I consider Advantage overpriced is that it doesn't support QMK
[17:17:17] <thblt> I've seen people replace the Advantage2 central board with a custom one that runs QMK.
[17:17:39] <thblt> Which is a lot of tinkering on a $400 keyb, and will probably be a lot harder in the 360.
[17:17:51] <treflip> definitely :)
[17:18:47] <thblt> The halves seem to communicate over USB, don't know if QMK supports that now (or maybe it's just i2c using usb cables)
[17:18:56] <treflip> The build quality is pretty nice. However I don't like the MX switches.
[17:19:57] <thblt> Someone on Twitter asked them about hotswapping on the 360. Their reply was roughly "can't do, but we have something close that's cool"
[17:20:26] <thblt> I'm not picky re switches, I'm still using an old Corsair keyboard with **reds**
[17:20:47] <grym> thblt: yes
[17:21:52] <treflip> thblt: I guess, hotswap sockets don't work well with flexible PCBs :( 
[17:22:08] <thblt> grym: it's definitely the keyboard I'll get *unless* the 360 has at least half-decent firware *or* I get to finish my custom concave keyboard I've been working on for too long. 
[17:23:05] <thblt> treflip: Yeah, and kinesis don't even use real flex PCB, just thin FR4
