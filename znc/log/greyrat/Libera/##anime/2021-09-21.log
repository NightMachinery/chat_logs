[03:44:14] <tsukkin> hallo
[03:44:27] <amigojapan> Hi tsukkin 
[03:45:24] <amigojapan> I am probably going to be up for a short time and fall back asleep. This is a bad habit of mine.
[03:45:31] <tsukkin> me too
[03:45:46] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[03:46:22] <tsukkin> woke up after 6 hours of sleep and could not go back to sleep
[03:46:42] <tsukkin> drinking coffee though so i suppose we will see
[03:47:07] <amigojapan> I just woke up from a dream
[03:47:34] <amigojapan> Coffee is good
[03:48:12] <tsukkin> are there a lot of places to find coffee in japan ? it seems less popular there
[03:48:35] <tsukkin> i mean i am aware of the vending machines
[03:48:41] <amigojapan> No no coffee is super popular
[03:49:21] <tsukkin> huh
[03:49:27] <tsukkin> wonder why i have that impression then
[03:50:14] <amigojapan> tsukkin: in the last 6 or so years they have introduced very good coffee machines to convenience stores which is cheap and much better than Starbucks
[03:51:17] <amigojapan> I have such coffee every day
[03:51:39] <tsukkin> been a pretty long time since i had starbucks either if i have at all
[03:51:42] <amigojapan> tsukkin: the machine really grinds the beans
[03:52:10] <tsukkin> i do that myself usually
[03:52:17] <amigojapan> And they use beans from Brazil
[03:52:19] <tsukkin> mortar and pestle 
[03:52:31] <amigojapan> I see
[03:52:43] <tsukkin> coffee is pretty much the only thing i can prepare with any kind of competence though
[03:53:06] <amigojapan> I see
[03:53:39] <tsukkin> but yeah i can imagine having a place to go get some during a busy day would help a lot
[03:54:19] <amigojapan> I can't prepare coffee from beans, have never tried. But I can prepare some foods
[03:54:25] <tsukkin> my favorite beans so far came from el salvador but i forget the other details about them 
[03:54:31] <omero> just get a moka :)
[03:55:03] <tsukkin> i mostly just live off of cup ramen

[04:23:35] <omero> tsukkin: mostly yes. 
[04:23:42] <tsukkin> percolators went out of fashion somewhere like 60 years ago
[04:23:43] <omero> its the most common way there
[04:23:55] <amigojapan> In Japan they have a coffee they call "American coffee"but it is really watered down coffee
[04:24:05] <omero> ^that
[04:25:26] <omero> ok. the moka machine (as we call it) macchinetta del caff√® comes in mainly 2 variants. the 'bialetti' kind is the most popular (makes the best coffee, not too mild, not too strong)
[04:25:28] <amigojapan> At the conversation cafe they have all you can drink American coffee and tea
[04:25:36] <omero> and then you have the napolitan one. 
[04:26:10] <omero> the napolitan style is technically a 2-phase percolator
[04:26:18] <amigojapan> omero: is that in Italy?

[04:39:54] <tsukkin> amigojapan when i search that it shows as japanese
[04:40:07] <omero> ok. doria is an ancient family from genova
[04:40:16] <amigojapan> omero: the restaurant saizeriya invented it
[04:41:10] <omero> the doria in my memory relates to the sinking disaster of a famous ship named the Andrea Doria
[04:41:39] <omero> its not as famous as the sinking of the Titanic, but it was nevertheless a tragedy all the same
[04:42:25] <amigojapan> omero: it has turmik rice on the bottom. Then a layer of white sauce then meat sauce. Then it is backed
[04:42:51] <omero> that sounds interesting.

[05:55:15] <amigojapan> Right
[05:55:55] <omero> no loss of quality (hopefully)
[05:57:52] <omero> btw, tea is just as addictive as coffee is, amigojapan :/
[05:57:53] <amigojapan> omero: maybe you should use jpg for people with low bandwidth
[05:59:10] <omero> why would be jpg better than png... Im just asking. amigojapan 
[05:59:45] <amigojapan> omero: it uses lossy compression
[06:00:09] <omero> which one?

[06:00:34] <amigojapan> Jpeg is the compression format
[06:00:54] <omero> but in this case?
[06:01:06] <amigojapan> omero: convert the image to JPEG and see the difference in size
[06:02:06] <omero> the original image is in jpg format
[06:02:17] <amigojapan> It says PNG
[06:02:30] <omero> I wanted to share a downscaled version and decided for png

[06:07:55] <omero> alas, there is no one-size-fits-all for image file formats... :/
[06:08:43] <amigojapan> Well as long as he could see it. I guess the problem was solved
[06:09:27] <omero> It was my bad to share the original full scale jpeg. I had not considered Poeticode was on low bandwidth connection (how could I have known?)
[06:10:01] <amigojapan> omero: when I had to send images to someone in Cuba. The images had to be less than 100k each
[06:10:15] <Poeticode> i'm cruising at a nice frustrating 50KB/s rn lmao
[06:10:16] <omero> that makes sense, amigojapan 
[06:11:26] <omero> back in those days, we only had a very limited bandwidth to transfer images. the modern tech allows us to quickly forget that bandwidth _is_ a problem
[06:11:40] <amigojapan> omero: also the person from Cuba was amazed at how clean Japan is in places that are not even important
[06:11:51] <omero> and it wasnt about porn. that came later...

[06:23:16] <amigojapan> BBSs were awesome places to make friends
[06:23:28] <omero> I was addicted to play tradewars in the 80's

[06:27:20] <omero> we taped over... and reused
[06:27:23] <amigojapan> omero: I heard that the commands in vax were very intuitive
[06:27:34] <omero> we were very conscious about not wasting resources
[06:27:46] <amigojapan> I see
[06:27:57] <omero> we plugged the holes

[08:12:35] <amigojapan> tsukkin: we have always had premium fruits in Japan. But also have normal ones
[08:12:52] <tsukkin> no way grapes can be worth that much
[08:13:57] <Nanobot> If that's the going rate, and they're selling, then that means they're worth that much. To someone.
[08:14:25] <tsukkin> ' one bunch sold for $ 12 , 000 at auction ' 
[08:14:42] <amigojapan> tsukkin: they look like Â∑®Â≥∞which are normally much bigger than regular grapes
[08:14:52] <Nanobot> Probably to someone who isn't living on $60k/year.
[08:15:20] <tsukkin> looks like they have a very extensive quality control process 
[08:15:44] <tsukkin> think i would just eat more smaller grapes

[08:17:29] <tsukkin> maybe just not the market for that because i definitely drink coffee that would value around $ 50 / cup on occasion
[08:18:01] <tsukkin> amigojapan they look like they came out of a comic book
[08:18:07] <tsukkin> is this why all the food in anime looks so good
[08:18:16] <amigojapan> It's cheaper to buy them at the supermarket
[08:19:02] <amigojapan> tsukkin: kyohou are big
[08:19:24] <tsukkin> i think if they were as big as apples i would wanna try them but those are exactly the wrong size to be fun for me 
[08:20:21] <tsukkin> i guess plums are kind of close 
[08:20:21] <amigojapan> tsukkin: the point is you can buy ones that are just as big but for only like 5usd if you buy them at the supermarket
[08:21:01] <tsukkin> so how do some go for thousands at auction ?
[08:21:12] <tsukkin> are they just extremely pure unblemished ones 
[08:21:37] <amigojapan> tsukkin: cause Japan has premium fruits. It's not the price the usually go for
[08:22:14] <tsukkin> the question is more just whether the premium ones are actually special in some way

[09:20:03] <tsukkin> and 6 quotes in 6 years is hardly impressive anyway
[09:20:03] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I like many. Recently have been drinking suntory whiskey and chuuhai
[09:20:24] <amigojapan> tsukkin: but I hate beer
[09:20:37] <tsukkin> i hate beer too
[09:20:49] <tsukkin> chuuhai sounds right up my alley

[09:22:22] <amigojapan> I see
[09:22:46] <tsukkin> my favorite i think is strawberry 
[09:23:31] <tsukkin> have yet to find a melon or a lychee one though and i suspect i would like those more if i could get them
[09:23:31] <amigojapan> tsukkin: most of the alchohols o really like are full of sugar and I am avoiding them now

[09:25:17] <tsukkin> western wine is gross
[09:25:39] <tsukkin> i prefer to eat the wine grapes than to make them into that stuff
[09:25:43] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I also love Baillie's irish cream . That is probably my favourite
[09:25:53] <tsukkin> i put that in my coffee sometimes
[09:26:01] <tsukkin> or in hot cocoa
[09:26:32] <amigojapan> tsukkin: have you tried manishewitz wine?
[09:26:51] <tsukkin> not that i am aware of
[09:26:55] <amigojapan> That is actually sweet
[09:27:29] <tsukkin> will make a note of it 
[09:27:37] <amigojapan> tsukkin: it's totally different from other wines
[09:27:45] <tsukkin> i had a sparkling sake before and i liked it
[09:27:48] <tsukkin> fizz is fun
[09:27:57] <tsukkin> normal sake is so so

[10:24:09] <ButterNoodle> from their mother

[11:17:58] <mixfix41> the crazy thing about hypnotherapy is i think i recall reading that they actually use it?
[11:18:01] <amigojapan> It's so bitter
[11:18:03] <mixfix41> !c hypnotherapy
[11:18:04] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Hypnotherapy is a type of mind-body intervention in which hypnosis is used to create a state of focused attention and increased suggestibility in the treatment of a medical or psychological disorder or concern.
[11:19:08] <amigojapan> Yeah they use it mixfix41 
[11:19:10] <tsukkin> amigojapan not available on amazon here but i know there are smaller stores that tend to have things that can not be ordered on amazon
[11:19:17] <tsukkin> i would have to put it on my list to see
[11:20:20] <amigojapan> tsukkin: it is extremely bitter,I recommend making it into Goya champool before eating it
[11:20:39] <tsukkin> no point then i am hopeless at cooking
[11:20:47] <amigojapan> I see
[11:21:13] <tsukkin> do m berries affect its flavor ?
[11:21:58] <amigojapan> HMmm. I am not exaggerating when I say it is extremely bitter
[11:22:25] <tsukkin> i have eaten a lemon after m berries 
[11:22:31] <tsukkin> but not sure if bitter and sour work the same way
[11:23:47] <amigojapan> But sure. Salt seems to work with this. That is the main thing that takes out from the bitterness
[11:27:29] <tsukkin> i definitely consume a lot of salt
[11:27:48] <mixfix41> maybe i need one to become satisfy :)
[11:27:50] <tsukkin> probably half my body is sodium at this point
[11:28:10] <amigojapan> Ouch
[11:30:47] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I have heard Japanese phone companies are now curtains l charging extra for tethering to computer, how do they do that? My small cellphone company does not have any extra charges

[12:13:47] <amigojapan> Deerie2: I don't find that fun
[12:13:53] <Deerie2> oh
[12:14:03] <Deerie2> well neither do i
[12:14:17] <Deerie2> you caught me
[12:14:28] <amigojapan> Deerie2: and with tattoos you also can't go into normal onsen
[12:14:49] <Deerie2> can you go into abnormal onsen?
[12:15:25] <amigojapan> Yeah, there are some onsen owned by Yakuza that allow tattoos
[12:15:55] <Deerie2> i wonder if sega and yakuza have a thing or what
[12:16:23] <amigojapan> Never played it
[12:16:38] <Deerie2> same
[12:17:20] <mixfix41> really a nice idea if you can think of say all your family has no tattoo that you all get a tattoo to bond
[12:17:33] <mixfix41> at once
[12:17:37] <mixfix41> at the parlor
[12:17:39] <Deerie2> even the children

[12:18:32] <tsukkin> i agree
[12:18:35] <amigojapan> Pure is better
[12:18:54] <mixfix41> what if a tattoo was like protection against a worm some optical worms humans transmit
[12:18:55] <tsukkin> do foreigners use the yakuza onsen ?
[12:19:35] <amigojapan> tsukkin: yes. Cause the law applies to foreigners as well
[12:19:53] <tsukkin> it is law ?

[12:45:52] <amigojapan> Bco1981: hi o/
[12:45:59] <Bco1981> hi amigojapan o/
[12:46:31] <amigojapan> Bco1981: do you understand how Japanese major cellphone companies get to charge extra for tethering?
[12:46:48] <Bco1981> eh?
[12:46:58] <Bco1981> no, how can they even detect that ?
[12:47:10] <Bco1981> if you tether your laptop to your phone.
[12:47:12] <tsukkin> pretty sure us companies do that as well
[12:47:21] <Bco1981> it's still the phone doing the data
[12:47:57] <amigojapan> Bco1981: gigguk mentioned it. And I hard heard about it before
[12:48:33] <amigojapan> Bco1981: my tiny cellphone company does not have any extra charges
[12:49:04] <amigojapan> Had heard*
[12:49:55] <Bco1981> wtf that's a load of bull... https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-truth-about-tethering-pay-up-or-you-are-a-thief/
[12:49:55] <ImoutoBot> [title] The truth about tethering: Pay up or you are a thief | ZDNet
[12:50:27] <Bco1981> it's data no matter how you look at it, and it's still going through the phone using it's exsisting data plan
[12:50:28] <amigojapan> Let me see Bco1981 
[12:50:42] <Bco1981> the CARRIER is the theif!¬ß
[12:51:05] <Bco1981> trying to get more money out of customers using their allready payed data plan
[12:51:12] <tsukkin> bco1981 since when to telecoms companies work on good faith ?
[12:51:28] <Bco1981> makes not f'ing difference on how they use it, they payed for data.
[12:51:29] <tsukkin> or any major company for that matter
[12:52:00] <Bco1981> good faith ? where is the need for good faith for using what you have already paid for ?
[12:52:11] <amigojapan> Bco1981: is this about the US?
[12:52:25] <tsukkin> why do companies need to act fairly when they could simply act unfairly for greater profit ?
[12:52:34] <Bco1981> don't know, just found that article
[12:52:56] <Bco1981> tsukkin: and that sure is, unfair
[12:53:10] <amigojapan> Bco1981: seems it is about America cause I saw a picture of Verizon shops
[12:53:49] <tsukkin> net neutrality was a big meme in america until it stopped being a thing and now nobody talks about it
[12:54:10] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I quit a greedy company and changed to a very fair one
[12:55:12] <amigojapan> tsukkin: not before losing thousands of dollars :(
[12:55:32] <tsukkin> from what i understand not everyone has that option for some reason or other
[12:55:34] <mixfix41> too many normies if the devices were selling of the shelves we would not be in this situation
[12:56:18] <mixfix41> it will have to change but sucks that normal people dont even see the worth of it but i g everyone has wifi at home so never even think twice about sapping the mobile clearnet
[12:57:32] <Bco1981> The point is these restrictions demonstrate clearly that carriers don't believe that customers are entitled to use the amount of data that is paid for in any way the customer desires. Fair or not, the carrier holds all the cards and they own the network so they make the rules.
[12:57:59] <Bco1981> so they just feel like it. and f' you.
[12:58:46] <tsukkin> that whole concept kind of applies to everything
[12:59:33] <Bco1981> haven't heard of any carrier doing that here.
[13:00:40] <amigojapan> Bco1981: my sin card cost me 100usd per YEAR, for unlimited data. And tethering is enabled
[13:00:51] <Bco1981> nice
[13:00:56] <amigojapan> Sim*
[13:01:00] <Bco1981> but low bitrate ?
[13:01:04] <Bco1981> 2mbits or something ?
[13:01:30] <amigojapan> Yeah but not that low 280kbps
[13:01:54] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it's enough to do video calls
[13:02:08] <Bco1981> you should try doing a speed test
[13:02:12] <amigojapan> And listen to podcasts
[13:02:30] <Bco1981> find some good signal spot and speed test
[13:02:31] <amigojapan> Bco1981: ok
[13:02:54] <amigojapan> I will try it now. Let me disconnect from WiFi
[13:05:09] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it says 6ms. Actually I think I get 3gb cap of fast internet before slowing down
[13:06:03] <Bco1981> 6ms that's the respons time, but what is tha transfer rate ?
[13:06:40] <amigojapan> Bco1981: 6mbps
[13:06:58] <amigojapan> Let me do it again
[13:07:55] <amigojapan> Bco1981: yeah 6mbps
[13:08:19] <Bco1981> up and down ?

[15:09:23] <emmeka> conservatives didn't gain or lose seats, probably because that new right wing party the People's Party pulled 5% of the vote. The changes are pretty mild, for an election that seemed hotly contested... the big one is that the NDP (social democratic party) and governing Liberals have now gained enough seats that the two of them together have the majority of parliament
[15:09:37] <emmeka> this means that Trudeau can ignore the conservatives, and pander to the left.

[17:17:26] <darkwitch> from what you said some months ago, it sounded like it wasn't commonly used in japan
[17:17:51] <darkwitch> that is all :)
[17:17:56] <amigojapan> Yeah. I don't know what they call it if it is
[17:18:14] <darkwitch> maybe it is common then
[17:18:34] <tsukkin> took some acetaminophen
[17:18:50] <amigojapan> Bufferin and loxonin are the common Western medicines and they also sell Chinese herbal medicine
[17:19:09] <amigojapan> tsukkin: hope you feel better soon
[17:19:25] <darkwitch> acetaminophen is the same as paracetamol
[17:20:07] <darkwitch> bufferin is a brand name, like tylenol
[17:20:28] <amigojapan> Ok
[17:20:48] <darkwitch> it seems the pharma industry enjoy confusing people
[17:20:49] <tsukkin> maybe taking a shower would help

[17:25:48] <Ashl3y4> ah
[17:25:53] <Ashl3y4> intresting 
[17:28:11] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: we calculated you can watch about 35 episodes of anime per day if you take it to extremes
[17:29:02] <Ashl3y4> amigojapan: are those 24 minutes episodes?
[17:29:17] <amigojapan> 25 minutes
[17:29:32] <tsukkin> you can do more if you skip the op and ed
[17:29:41] <amigojapan> True
[17:29:51] <Ashl3y4> I could watch like 100+ episodes of one Piece in a week if I did that
[17:30:36] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: tomako and I watched 100 episodes of candy candy in 3 days
[17:31:43] <Ashl3y4> that's somewhat impressive 
[17:31:57] <amigojapan> Yep
[17:32:02] <Ashl3y4> none of you got tired half way through? 
[17:32:26] <tsukkin> amigojapan now go rewatch sailor moon in one day
[17:32:39] <amigojapan> I got super tired, tomako can only watch anime by binging it
[17:32:51] <amigojapan> Lol tsukkin 
[17:33:23] <amigojapan> tsukkin: it's 200 episodes so maybe 6 days is doable
[17:33:39] <tsukkin> amigojapan watch at 2 . 5 x speed
[17:34:00] <amigojapan> Nah that would ruin it. I never do that
[17:34:16] <tsukkin> i do it to music during panic attacks
[17:34:17] <Ashl3y4> I watch youtube videos speed up :D

[17:37:31] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: also I don't like the recommendations
[17:37:50] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: I don't even look at them

[17:38:10] <amigojapan> Yes
[17:38:28] <Ashl3y4> I know people that do that, I should do that more to not miss on a video by them
[17:38:34] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: I used to watch recommendations until it started too repeat everything

[17:42:31] <darkwitch> watching youtube only based on recommendations is not a pleasant experience
[17:42:32] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: I have never used "new release"as something I usually look for

[17:43:58] <tsukkin> youtube only recommends old videos if i have spent a lot of time watching one particular channel 
[17:44:08] <tsukkin> then it will give me some of their older stuff
[17:44:15] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I am subscribed to many but u only follow like 10
[17:44:16] <tsukkin> never old stuff from someone i do not watch
[17:44:20] <darkwitch> many of them are basically dead while others release something nearly every day

[17:54:54] <tsukkin> i have noticed that japanese people seem to be smaller on average than americans 
[17:55:09] <Cryowolf> well yes, Asians typically are
[17:55:11] <amigojapan> Yeah definitely tsukkin 
[17:55:25] <Cryowolf> I towered over Thai people when I was 15 years old and on vacation there
[17:55:25] <tsukkin> 100 kg seems like a kind of small number to cut off at to me 
[17:55:34] <Cryowolf> most thought I was an adult too
[17:56:21] <amigojapan> tsukkin: yeah but it is common is Japanese scales except at doctors offices
[17:56:43] <Cryowolf> mine cuts off at 150
[17:56:46] <tsukkin> suppose a smaller range is cheaper to manufacture for some reason 
[17:56:59] <tsukkin> if most of your sales demographic would not need it 
[17:57:00] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: that happened to my son at 13, they thought he was a college student
[17:57:12] <tsukkin> amigojapan you could probably import an american scale 
[17:57:12] <Cryowolf> standard cheap scales here are 120kgs
[17:57:46] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I could weigh myself in your scale, last time I weighed myself I was 124kg
[17:57:56] <amigojapan> tsukkin: true
[17:58:05] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, lol, yeah we seem to look at a lot more mature I guess. Maybe cause of our height and bone structure
[17:59:24] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: my son is half Japanese but his body seems to have taken after my side of the family. Also he does not look Japanese
[17:59:48] <Ashl3y4> does he look mexican?
[17:59:49] <Cryowolf> Ive seen those youtube channels that ask people things on the streets in different countries, they asked Japanese women what the maximum age difference is on who'd they date. Most said 8-10 years and then asked "what about a western guy?" and suddenly they were closer to 20 years for some reason
[18:00:12] <Cryowolf>  In Asia discrimination is very open and accepted
[18:00:21] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: I don't look Mexican. What is "Mexican"?
[18:00:43] <Ashl3y4> uuuhhh
[18:00:46] <Cryowolf> he probably meant olive tanned
[18:00:47] <Ashl3y4> mexican?
[18:00:53] <amigojapan> Ashl3y4: Mexican is at least a mixture of two races, but really more
[18:01:08] <Ashl3y4> well there are white people in mexico too Cryowolf
[18:01:10] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I am not tanned
[18:01:15] <Cryowolf> I know that Ashl3y4
[18:01:31] <Ashl3y4> so he looks ... white?
[18:02:09] <amigojapan> My family from my father's side are Jewish. Ashkenazi. And from my mother is also white looking, but her sister is tanned
[18:03:16] <amigojapan> My Mexican family had vitiligo so eventually they lose colour of the skin like Michel Jackson
[18:03:19] <Cryowolf> my entire family is white as they come, except my half sisters who are half Swedish and half Italian. Nobody on my side is Italian though
[18:04:07] <Cryowolf> but for some reason people are extra respectful of their family on that side, going through their father

[18:13:58] <ButterNoodle> if u black.. u black person.. its ok
[18:14:27] <DunceCotus> just call them a person

[18:21:08] <DunceCotus> manko XD
[18:21:09] <Cryowolf> tsukkin, she meant that not seeing ang judging someones race is dismissing their race
[18:21:18] <Cryowolf> and that's racist
[18:21:20] <tsukkin> that sounds correct
[18:21:33] <DunceCotus> Princess Monononononot ok
[18:21:45] <Cryowolf> so me not judging someone by the color of the skin, is racist

[18:26:07] <amigojapan> Lol darkwitch 
[18:26:36] <Cryowolf> tsukkin, no because black people have had very different lived experience in different parts of the world. Not everyone in every country were enslaved or colonized. Not every country has the same racist history as the US and her failure to acknowledge that is on her. If she couldn't tell it's discriminatory to make such assumptions based on the color of someones skin, that's a life lesson she'll hopefully eventually learn.
[18:26:39] <tsukkin> darkwitch county music exists you just need to visit your local city hall
[18:27:00] <Cryowolf> and people today aren't typically enslaved with the exception of some countries that defacto enslave people
[18:27:06] <darkwitch> they play music there tsukkin?

[18:28:07] <JesseDesu> filipinos what
[18:28:22] <tsukkin> if you care to understand why people might take a negative view of your attitude then you should correct it
[18:28:37] <Cryowolf> people don't, she did. Nobody else did
[18:28:49] <tsukkin> if you want too be obstinate you can do that too but getting mad at other people for not liking your obvious flaws is bizarre

[18:29:23] <tsukkin> if you say so
[18:29:38] <Cryowolf> Treating people based on who they are, what they do, how they act and treat others, isn't a character flaw
[18:29:56] <Cryowolf> It's treating someone as an individual

[18:35:57] <tsukkin> amigojapan neoliberalism is a specific ideology 
[18:36:01] <darkwitch> no one really knows how the cranberries fit in
[18:36:12] <lastonestanding> darkwitch: why are those signs so big?
[18:36:23] <Cryowolf> I'm a realist and pragmatic, I like to go with the logical while trying to deduce the outcome. As for my political beliefs, they come from just about everyone, the left, the right, libertarianism, authoritarnism
[18:36:29] <Cryowolf> everywhere*
[18:36:43] <tsukkin> socialism and neoliberalism have very minor overlap 
[18:36:55] <darkwitch> everything must be big in usa
[18:37:02] <Cryowolf> so no I'm not a neoliberal
[18:37:23] <tsukkin> you still probably are 
[18:37:42] <lastonestanding> what am I if I love nature?
[18:37:44] <tsukkin> there are some online tests you could take to narrow it down more specifically 
[18:37:45] <Cryowolf> because you know me so well you can judge every belief I have
[18:37:48] <lastonestanding> a nature guy?
[18:38:02] <tsukkin> lastonestanding nature guy is the technical term 
[18:38:04] <amigojapan> tsukkin: that sounds like stereotyping

[18:38:13] <darkwitch> naturian
[18:38:29] <tsukkin> cryowolf the ' center ' is neoliberalism 
[18:39:00] <tsukkin> this is not a slur or judgment 
[18:39:01] <Cryowolf> no...cause the center doesn't tell you which opinion I took from where to place me in the center
[18:39:19] <Cryowolf> those tests are simply based on + and - values
[18:39:24] <amigojapan> tsukkin: the political compass out me far in the liberal leftist corner
[18:39:39] <Cryowolf> the tests are worthless
[18:39:43] <tsukkin> also describing yourself as a ' pragmatist ' is funny because everyone considers themselves to be pragmatic 
[18:40:03] <lastonestanding> aren't some people opportunists?
[18:40:10] <Cryowolf> I certainly am

[18:40:51] <Cryowolf> not if it'll hurt someone though

[18:54:38] <Cryowolf> or if you want the drug while there's no ongoing trial, an oncologist can prescribe it but since it's not an approved medicine, it's not always included in our high cost protection healthcare system
[18:54:54] <Cryowolf> so the drug can become very expensive to buy and use outside of trials

[18:57:48] <Cryowolf> the other drugs would cost way more than that
[18:57:59] <Cryowolf> simply at levels I couldn't ever hope to afford
[18:58:49] <Cryowolf> but my oncologist will try to get it licensed and approved for me, but only me. It would be a personal license for the experimental drug. Only one pharmacy wouold be allowed to hold it and it would then be free

[19:42:20] <Miyukii> you can get them in large packs for not too much
[19:42:28] <omero> I try to elaborate: a felt tip allows you to apply pressure
[19:43:07] <omero> some languages, rely on that to convey a specific form of a glyph, ok?
[19:43:21] <Miyukii> that's nice if you write it slowly and neat

[19:43:59] <omero> Miyukii: its also a form of art
[19:44:19] <omero> to write properly.
[19:44:28] <amigojapan> omero: when you say "a felt tip", do you mean the actual point of the pen is felt?
[19:44:51] <omero> amigojapan: ok. think of writing with ink and a quill
[19:44:55] <Miyukii> absolutely true. as I said, if you take it slow for that piece of writing its fine
[19:45:11] <omero> or use a brush. 
[19:45:14] <amigojapan> !c quill
[19:45:16] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: A quill is a writing tool made from a moulted flight feather of a large bird. Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.

[19:46:33] <omero> plume :D
[19:46:39] <amigojapan> Right
[19:47:04] <omero> right. its easy to understand why plumes were used 
[19:47:17] <amigojapan> Right
[19:47:18] <omero> you would pluck one from a goose for instance
[19:47:41] <amigojapan> It's a natural occurring pen
[19:47:44] <omero> and with a sharp blade cut it diagonal to make it sharp
[19:47:58] <omero> the plume is like a cilinder
[19:48:08] <amigojapan> Right
[19:48:11] <omero> it holds the ink
[19:48:18] <omero> and its also very flexible
[19:48:19] <amigojapan> Right
[19:48:40] <omero> THAT gives the writing its 'character'... the style

[19:51:53] <amigojapan> omero: when I was a child they changed half way from teaching cursive writing to block writing. That was confusing
[19:52:07] <omero> because one can really express his own ... not only in the word being written

[19:54:56] <omero> signatures are hardly forged easily. you need to be an artist to forge a signature. its not impossible but requires dedication and ... some skill ;)

[19:55:44] <omero> a signature is made by the person
[19:56:12] <omero> it reflects the impulse, the soul.

[20:05:50] <Urchin[emacs]> so I use fountain pens, mainly as an ergonomic choice (helps with my handwriting somewhat as well)

[20:15:56] <Urchin[emacs]> Sxem: ink cartridges are usually expensive, but I mainly use bottled ink

[20:16:33] <Sxem> the ink fountains out from the cartridge
[20:16:51] <omero> and the "pen" part of a fountain pen, is interchangeable (usually) and made of a metal that is somewhat impervious to oxidizing
[20:16:52] <Urchin[emacs]> omero: that depends on a particular pen, gold nibs tend to be more springy
[20:16:52] <Sxem> it spews ink
[20:17:01] <omero> yes
[20:17:11] <Sxem> it yeets ink

[22:29:36] <Cryowolf> annoying
[22:29:42] <omero> very. 
[22:29:44] <Cryowolf> so can't spoiler tag things either
[22:29:47] <Cryowolf> ffs
[22:29:59] <omero> Cryowolf: in IRC its pointless
[22:30:21] <omero> because the protocol doesnt include that concept
[22:30:54] <Cryowolf> I'm using adilirc
[22:30:59] <Cryowolf> cause it's closest to mirc
[22:31:56] <omero> the original IRC protocol was... conceived back in a time when ... terminals were terminals and clients were clients. no fancy stuff like colors (8 color terminals, yay!)
[22:32:11] <omero> 7-bit stuff. 
[22:32:15] <omero> over serial lines
[22:32:30] <omero> that is what you had to work with... most of the times
[22:32:45] <Cryowolf> so how to do spoiler tags then?
[22:32:59] <Cryowolf> 0,0white on white
[22:33:03] <omero> thus... tags are a fancy stuff. I could pull that trick off, of course
[22:33:10] <omero> but it wouldnt make much sense
[22:33:18] <omero> yes. thats white on white
[22:33:25] <omero> and its annoying
[22:33:45] <Cryowolf> I want a spoiler tag nobody can read without highlighting it
[22:34:02] <omero> we all can.
[22:34:11] <omero> and that its the annoying part
[22:34:17] <Cryowolf> cause if I want to mention a spoiler to more than one person, then PM doesnt work
[22:34:32] <omero> yes lol
[22:34:45] <omero> I really get what you mean, Cryowolf 
[22:35:06] <Cryowolf> well wont most people see 5,5stuff like this?
[22:35:17] <omero> its just ... quite ... pointless. or in other words an unnecessary effort
[22:35:31] <Cryowolf> why?
[22:35:49] <Cryowolf> cause some clients don't give a shit about it?
[22:35:54] <omero> because in the end you say things that are meant to be seen anyhow
[22:36:06] <omero> precisely Cryowolf 
[22:36:24] <Cryowolf> I dont want to spoil things for people who haven't seen it yet
[22:36:30] <omero> why bothering? it makes sense in a forum
[22:36:36] <omero> but on IRC?
[22:37:15] <Cryowolf> because I want to chat with people and occasionally something might be brought up that would be a spoiler
[22:37:28] <omero> the difference is that forums (the most professional ones) _DO_ have way to preserve the reader innocence (and thus being spoiled)
[22:37:47] <omero> on IRC almost no one cares about that, Cryowolf 
[22:37:53] <omero> we like to talk.
[22:37:56] <omero> to the core

[22:38:33] <Cryowolf> what are you talking about?
[22:38:40] <omero> then you choose the proper channel (#room-name-here)
[22:39:08] <Cryowolf> thia would be the proper channel, in my years here nobody has enjoyed being spoiled
[22:39:35] <omero> no idea what thia is
[22:39:52] <Cryowolf> ...
[22:39:57] <omero> care to spoil me?
[22:40:40] <Cryowolf> no because obviously you don't care
[22:40:50] <omero>  /msg alis list thia doesnt show any result.

[22:42:29] <mathu> Cryowolf: the annoying thing about spoilers on irc is a lot of people have a different blue for BG and FG (or whatever other color) so some of them can still read your spoiler haha
[22:42:30] <omero> my bad. used a much more restricted pattern when asking alis to match 'thia' 
[22:43:44] <Cryowolf> mathu, even for the simplest like 1,1 or 2,2?
[22:43:45] <mathu> omero: in this channel we do prefer people tag spoilers in this channel. "Tagging spoilers. Preferably with ANSI color codes", see the guidelines link in the topic for more info
[22:43:57] <omero> yes, mathu ... that is the reason that 'white on white' is never true ... because one can customize his terminal and client and eventually end up having ivory as one color
[22:44:12] <Cryowolf> ansi?
[22:44:17] <mathu> Cryowolf: i used to do black-on-black but someone told me they could still read it so i do blue-on-blue now
[22:44:40] <mathu> Cryowolf: ANSI color codes are what you've been using. that's the google search term for configuring it in some irc clients
[22:44:43] <omero> ansi. a standard.
[22:45:01] <Cryowolf> I'm not sure what adil can do but it has two types, a simple one at the top and then a less simple one below
[22:45:07] <Cryowolf> with shades etc
[22:45:09] <omero> its how terminals define their 'palette'
[22:45:10] <mathu> omero: it's a best-effort rule, we won't crucify you even if you forget to mark spoilers entirely
[22:45:13] <Cryowolf> Im guessing the top one is the ansi
[22:45:54] <mathu> omero: same with tagging nsfw. it's just a courteous thing to do
[22:46:05] <omero> mathu: you would first have to catch me ;)

[22:48:17] <omero> I was just expressing some facts mathu 
[22:48:24] <Cryowolf> I mean if several people asked me about something spoilerish, I'd tag it with a simple 2,2color
