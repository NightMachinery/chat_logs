[02:56:25] <evilgohan2> So... here's the suck: the Twitch API doesn't provide a means to verify the status of a channel (live or not) so trying to use the Twitch API is pointless for this
[02:58:00] <evilgohan2> https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#modify-channel-information
[02:58:17] <evilgohan2> The only _supported_ "automated" way to get the status of a Twitch channel is to use webhooks - meaning you need to have a consumer sitting out there getting webhooks from Twitch, and then of course configuring something to process those.
[02:58:32] <evilgohan2> https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/webhooks-reference#topic-stream-changed
[03:03:23] <evilgohan2> ^ duds: probably why scripts might not readily exist
[03:05:15] <duds> ahhh... unfortunate..
[03:08:27] <duds> Idk enough about this stuff but I guess a cron job could check for stream status from it?
[03:10:05] <evilgohan2> More accurately, to nutshell it, you would need an endpoint set to receive json. Then you would need to subscribe to receive webhooks from Twitch. Your endpoint would then need to consume said webhooks (json) and store it - either in a queue or on disk somewhere. You would then need another process (technically this could be done by 1, but that's poor practice), to read that JSON and act 
[03:10:05] <evilgohan2> from there - i.e.: trigger an action.
[03:11:19] <duds> ah ok this is way out of my league then lol
[03:11:27] <duds> thanks anyway
[03:12:03] <evilgohan2> np. Truth be told, it's not that it's necessarily difficult (given a bit of programming experience). It's just... a pain.
[03:12:07] <evilgohan2> and arduous.
