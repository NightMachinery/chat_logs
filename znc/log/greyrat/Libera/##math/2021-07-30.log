[03:20:14] <buster> johnkeats6: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xndgh8md/index.jpg
[03:21:24] <Capso> PlanckWalk: you gave C(N,M-m) (M-m)^M as an upper-bound. But that's only for large N, right?
[03:21:40] <cherim> What's the exact formulation of the "m non-distinct"?

[03:25:35] <PlanckWalk> Obviously m has to be close to M when M >> N
[03:25:48] <Capso> PlanckWalk: "not so good" as in we need a constant, or as in it over-counts?
[03:25:52] <PlanckWalk> Because nearly all sequences in M >> N case repeat almost all their terms
[03:25:58] <PlanckWalk> Over-counts
[03:26:00] <Fangs> cherim: so I think m is "string length - distinct letters'
[03:26:25] <cherim> The answer is the Stirling number of the second kind then
[03:26:48] <cherim> Multiplied by something like (N-m+1)!, depending on how m is defined

[03:33:45] <cherim> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind
[03:34:42] <BaguetteBeing> hey cherim
[03:34:56] <BaguetteBeing> I completely forgot how symmetrical polys worked
[03:36:06] <cherim> S(M, M-m)N!/(N-M+m)! or such, the notation for m is inconvenient
[03:37:01] <cherim> The number of strings of length M which use letters {1, 2, ...k}, each at least once, is S(n, k)k!
[03:37:36] <cherim> Your constraint fixes the number of distinct letters that appear to be M-m
[03:38:32] <cherim> So the partition of positions is counted by S(M, M-m), and assignment of letters to parts by N*(N-1)*..., M-m factors
[03:39:20] <cherim> Maybe with another (M-m)! in the denominator, so binomial(N, M-m)
[03:39:45] <cherim> As for any asymptotics/bounds, it's directly the question of the Stirling asymptotics
[03:40:20] <cherim> Nothing is problem-specific, just take the papers where https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind is from

[03:44:33] <Capso> or is there anything different?
[03:44:44] <cherim> It's like estimating S(M, M-m) as (M-m)^M, extremely crude
[03:44:47] <PlanckWalk> Yes, the first asymptotic expression on the Wikipedia page (for fixed M-m) gives that
[03:45:28] <Capso> cherim: I see, so you're proposing C(N,M-m) S(M,M-m)
[03:45:50] <cherim> In this form it's not an estimate, it's the exact answer

[03:46:26] <cherim> But S() is not very convenient so I understood you want it in explicit exponents

[03:48:46] <BaguetteBeing> Q: 27 of the Senior Division of the Australian Mathematics Competition in 2006
[03:49:09] <Fangs> its kinda funny that you went back to that answer, but as an estimate
[03:49:13] <cherim> It shows how to find e_k from p_k and previously known e_j explicitly
[03:49:16] <Fangs> 14:27 <Capso> so, N^(M-m) C(M,m) ? <-- from our discussion
[03:49:41] <BaguetteBeing> The point is that my brain is melted and I don't understand any of it
[03:50:03] <BaguetteBeing> I've been up for 2 days straight
[03:50:32] <Capso> cherim: hmm, I'm trying to understand this better: S(M,M-m) is th number of equivalence relations with M-m equivalence classes on the M positions
[03:52:12] <cherim> This means the number of strings of M letters {1, 2, ..., M-m}, each letter must appear at least once
[03:52:47] <cherim> In your vectors like (1,1,2,3), m fixes the number of different entries in the string
[03:53:15] <cherim> Relabel them as 1, 2, ... M-m in increasing order, you get precisely those strings
[03:53:37] <cherim> So "which positions are equal, which aren't" is counted by S(M, M-m)
[03:53:39] <Capso> Fangs: C(N,M-m) (M-m)^M appears to be a bit better than N^(M-m) C(M,m)
[03:53:57] <cherim> And what labels fill these groups is an extra choice of M-m from N
[03:54:25] <Fangs> fair
[03:54:30] <Capso> cherim: got it
[03:54:43] <cherim> In fact, what you count is "maps from {1,...M} to {1,...N} with the image having size exactly M-m"
[03:55:16] <cherim> You can count those by first choosing the image in binom(N, M-m) ways, then counting surjective maps
[03:56:13] <cherim> And that's entry in row 1, column 3 in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelvefold_way#Formulas

[07:30:01] <cherim> A descent in a permutation s is simply an index i such that s[i]>s[i+1]
[07:31:32] <cherim> Take any two vectors, consider all possible their shuffles. For each shuffle calculate the number of descents in it
[07:31:51] <cherim> How many shuffles yield k descents?
[07:32:24] <Fangs> I'd imagine you'd know the context why this is exciting
[07:32:45] <cherim> 1) turns out, this depends only on relative orders inside each permutations, but not on how elements of one compare to elements of another. This is not obvious at all!
[07:33:24] <cherim> 2) The answer may be explicitly found through the usual generating functions (again not expected a priori)
[07:33:37] <cherim> 3) The proof is difficult, instructive and generalizable
[07:34:17] <Fangs> interesting
[07:34:28] <cherim> The result is due to Stanley in 1972
[07:35:00] <cherim> On Zeilberger's seminar a generalization of this to vectors with repeated elements was presented in January 2021
[07:35:33] <cherim> The technique changed from symmetric functions to quasisymmetric
[07:35:58] <cherim> Which 4) aren't obviously useful at all from their definition but work

[07:40:12] <Fangs> cherim: in our undergrad class, we used the number of walks on an integer grid to prove some identities about the catalan numbrers
[07:40:32] <Fangs> (think it was something along the lines of (+1,+1) or (+1,-1) and they hnever cross the x-axis)
[07:41:17] <Fangs> that case admits some really nice reucrence identities, which is 'evident' pictuorially
[07:41:21] <Fangs> pictorially*
[07:42:05] <cherim> I don't think this example is more pictorial than, say, Rolle's or Lagrange's theorem
[07:42:20] <cherim> It's just a normal rigorous proof

[07:43:40] <Fangs> lagrange is pretty nice once you combine them with topological groups or homogeneous spaces
[07:44:08] <cherim> There is a class of combinatorial (=bijective) proofs in combinatorics
[07:44:21] <cherim> They are usually much harder to find than non-restricted ones
[07:44:42] <cherim> Considered more "enlightening" but it's questionable

[09:51:26] <Fangs> I should stop fucking doxxing myself like an idiot
[09:51:27] <Fangs> This subject introduces the essential features of decision-making techniques encountered in operations research, management, industry, business and economics. It shows how to construct formal mathematical models for practical decision-making as encountered in two-person games, multi-objective optimisation problems, stochastic decision problems, group decision and social choice, and decision-making under uncertainty. It shows
[09:51:28] <Fangs> students further uses of linear programming and introduces dynamic programming techniques.
[09:52:17] <econo> ok ya that'd be worthwhile
[09:52:33] <Fangs> discrete maths wouldn't bedick about complex analysis either
[09:53:07] <Fangs> techniques in OR, we learn about quasi(?) psuedo(?) newtonian method for basically optimizing a convex function
[09:53:35] <loopspace> Sharing a single link from MSE is already usually enough to self-doxx
[09:53:43] <econo> OR is at the core of some prominent methods in macro
[09:53:49] <econo> but it's a very applied flavor
[09:54:01] <Fangs> interesting
[09:54:16] <Fangs> econo: I was hoping you'd tell me I was wrong and abstract algebra or w/e is useful in economic theory
[09:54:39] <econo> i have never seen any abstract algebra used in econ
[09:54:46] <loopspace> Is economic theory useful?
[09:54:56] <Fangs> the three set of elective basically corresponds to our "pure math" vs "statistics" vs "discrete maths & operation research" majors
[09:55:22] <econo> discrete math wouldn't hurt, but idk how useful it'd be either
[09:55:24] <Fangs> I did pure, I want people to love pure maths, but the pure math suggestion just feel so disengenuous lol
[09:55:31] <econo> like there's some research using networks
[09:55:40] <econo> and if you're working with agent-based models it might be helpful

[09:55:45] <econo> but those are pretty niche
[09:55:49] <Fangs> its very OR dominant
[09:56:23] <Fangs> knowing some combinatorics never hurt I'd say. you're really screwed sometimes when you need to count something but dont know how to do it
[09:57:25] <rsonx> hello, I am unable to find much about unambiguous context free language. How is it defined?
[09:58:33] <int-e> rsonx: it's really a property of a context-free grammar; a grammar is ambiguous if there is a word that has more than one derivation (syntax tree, depending on how you view things)
[09:59:11] <econo> Fangs seems to me the main thing here is they should do a better job of highlighting what's really useful and what is only tangentially relevant
[09:59:23] <int-e> rsonx: there is a concept for languages too; a context-free language is *inherently ambiguous* if every context-free grammar accepting that language is ambiguous
[09:59:33] <econo> econ major would be much better off taking some programming and cs and other econ classes over a lot of these
[10:00:00] <Fangs> econo: this is written by the maths dept for the bach of science majors

[10:04:32] <econo> ya, i like that list. I'd also remove complex analysis.
[10:04:56] <econo> that actually sounds like a fun course and maybe a good blend for econ

[10:10:02] <Fangs> you wouldn't know this, but our real analysis course is almost 75% proof writting course (think proving the sum of two odd numbers is even, that's the first 30-40% of the course)
[10:10:29] <econo> ah is there no intro to proofs prereq then
[10:10:35] <Fangs> so the only substantial real analysis is in that hilbert spaces course.. idk maybe its a bit better now
[10:10:42] <Fangs> nah there isn't that's our one and only intro to proof course
[10:10:51] <Fangs> (or used to be.. I think they're changing that)
[10:11:37] <Fangs> they're lauching calculus 1: advanced, calculus 2: advanced. apparently it has additional topic and greater emphasis on proofs and rigour. but this is after I graduate
[10:12:17] <econo> does your school just have 1 calculus sequence then?
[10:12:30] <econo> not 1 for math and physics majors and 1 for everyone else?
[10:12:49] <Fangs> they have "accelerated maths" track, which squishes calculus 1 & calculus 2& linear algebra & real analysis into two course
[10:13:34] <Fangs> econo: you have no idea how awkward it is to go around talking to a bunch of pure math majors and they ask "oh, what did you get for accelerated maths?" and I told them.. I failed calculus 1 dude, i don't know what's this accelerometermath you're talking about
[10:14:12] <econo> i had a very weird math experience in college as well
[10:14:22] <Fangs> but no, even most math majors do the 'normal' track. they might start with calculus 2 instead of 1, but thats about it
[10:14:26] <econo> i didn't take calculus and didn't like math until i took real analysis
[10:14:41] <Fangs> same
[10:15:19] <Fangs> well I didnt liked the analysis part, it was the proof writting part. I get to prove set of 'fractions' is well-defined ring
[10:16:13] <rsonx> int-e but there is ambiguous language https://i.imgur.com/DSEh0Fi.png . So unambiguous language should be negation of that, i.e all grammar of unambiguous language is unambiguous?
[10:17:53] <int-e> rsonx: No, it says that a language is unambiguous if there exists an unambiguous language for it.
[10:18:25] <int-e> rsonx: It is a negation though; the quantifier changes under negation.
[10:19:09] <int-e> It's almost trivial to show that every non-empty context-free language has an ambiguous grammar.

[10:53:16] <int-e> rsonx: I think it's true, but what I'm considering is fairly elaborate; it involves non-terminals of the form (S,x,T), where S and T are states and x is a stack symbol; they are supposed to accept partial words that are accepted after pushing x and entering state S, and that pop off x and end up in state T. So that's a pretty big number of non-literals, and we haven't even gotten to the productions...

[10:55:51] <int-e> rsonx: I guess that's the real question. Have you seen that PDAs correspond to CFGs? If yes, the chances are pretty good that the grammar that is constructed is unambiguous if the PDA is deterministic.

[12:51:55] <PlanckWalk> Well, you know that some will have 5 and some 6

[12:52:45] <rendar> yeah, and what is the best way to distribute those 5 and 6?
[12:52:55] <PlanckWalk> After you distribute 5's, you've got 2 left over (22 = 4*5 + 2)
[12:53:02] <PlanckWalk> So you can get 2 6's.

[12:53:53] <rendar> and check if it's modulo with 5 == 0
[12:54:03] <PlanckWalk> Err, you could but that seems inefficient
[12:54:12] <rendar> uhm
[12:54:13] <PlanckWalk> But who cares, computers have tons of CPU
[12:54:29] <PlanckWalk> You can just directly compute how many 5's and 6's you get up front.
[12:54:41] <rendar> PlanckWalk: yeah, that would be better
[12:55:12] <rendar> consider i want to distribute 6's first
[12:55:31] <rendar> how to get the exact integer number of 6's ?
[12:55:43] <PlanckWalk> If you have N total to distribute over C groups, the smallest groups will have floor(N/C) in them.  There will be N % C groups that are 1 larger.

[19:18:09] <cadmio> the middle implication

[22:48:48] <cherim> I'll switch from this m to the more convenient k=M-m. You want to count the number of strings of length M1+M2 with elements from {1,2,...N}, exactly k distinct appearing, such that in the first M1 symbols there are exactly k1 distinct ones appearing, and in the last M2 there are exactly k2 distinct elements appearing?
[22:49:55] <Capso> cherim: sure. The length is 2M: (j_1, ..., j_M, j'_1, ..., j'_M) and the rest is correct

[22:52:46] <cherim> The Stirling part doesn't really change, you re-solve only the following: how many pairs of (k1-subset of {1,...N}, k2-subset of {1,...N}) are there souch that their union has size k
[22:53:21] <cherim> Which is just selection of intersection, then of k1-common, then of k2-common ones of {1,...N}

[23:10:29] <Capso> cherim: hmm, so the multinomial part is  multinomial(N, k1+k2-k, k-k_2, k-k_1), which counds the number of ways to split [1,N] into a sequence of disjoint subsets of sizes (k1+k2-k, k-k2, k-k1), right?
[23:11:44] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[23:11:53] <cherim> Yes. You can view this as follows: you know the total number of strings if you don't condition on k (the size of the union), just multiply numbers for the left and for the right
[23:12:16] <cherim> So you only need the distribution of k
[23:12:38] <cherim> Left string contributes a subset of size k1, right string a subset of size k2
[23:13:13] <cherim> How is the size of their union distributed? Note this is a purely binomial question, all Stirling complexity is gone
[23:13:42] <cherim> Enumerating such subsets is the same as assigning one of four possibilities to each of {1,2,...N}:

[23:14:00] <cherim> in both subsets, in 1st but not in the 2nd, in the 2nd but not in the 1st, in none
[23:14:32] <cherim> You know their sizes: x=k1+k2-k, k1-x, k2-x, the rest
[23:14:52] <cherim> So it's plain application of the multinomial coefficient definition
