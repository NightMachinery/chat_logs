[04:04:40] <rascul> i guess libvirt is expecting a group name
[04:05:01] <supastupid> i added the gpu and the audio and yes iommu is enabled
[04:05:06] <supastupid> or at least VT-X
[04:05:31] <cottnn> you followed the guide i sent right
[04:05:36] <rascul> i don't know where that group name is configured for libvirt
[04:05:48] <supastupid> yes cottnn
[04:06:02] <rascul> this is not iommu or gpu related
[04:06:05] <supastupid> and i am a part of the group
[04:06:17] <supastupid> weird issue is that after virt-manager can't connect to qemu

[04:07:08] <supastupid> yes
[04:07:16] <supastupid> i havent seen virtlockd and virtlogd
[04:07:28] <Psi-Jack> Though are not as common.
[04:07:54] <Dagmar> Sounds more like you need a distribution that has them set up correct

[04:09:23] <Psi-Jack> My personal feeling is, if you're a newbie using Arch, you shouldn't be. You should be at the point of knowing how to do 99% of your own knowledge+troubleshooting.
[04:09:42] <ayecee> your feelings are dumb.

[06:00:31] <nuxnux> if a command for vlc works get in a terminal emulator but if it is called right after login of the DE and it works but  gives the wrong resolution ... would that be a timing issue where something like sleep in an .sh script would be beneficial?
[06:00:35] <cottnn> Don't expect people to remember methods/classes/whatever by heart
[06:00:47] <jacekowski> that's what IDEs are for
[06:01:12] <Intelo> jacekowski correct. but do you want to hire a person who googles all  without good level of experience using those already? I will not hire person who googles "how to select all rows in sql" and copy pastes `select * from table`. Then gets stuck and finds out that he had to change `table` to real table name (after few minutes).
[06:01:32] <Intelo> cottnn ya correct but that was a example.
[06:01:47] <Intelo> bad example but a bit logical to test 'level of experience'

[06:19:19] <lockywolf> I mean, seriously, that "panopticon" idea is seriously sick.
[06:19:26] <ayecee> swap is useful any time you have a better use for memory than holding bits of program that aren't being used.
[06:19:58] <EdFletcher> which happens a lot more often than you think it might
[06:20:00] <ayecee> however if that's the best use you can think of for memory, then i guess you don't need swap

[08:15:21] <ayecee> probably
[08:17:17] <ayecee> a good first step would be to figure out what is using the memory

[08:18:19] <ayecee> you know what's also in the page cache?
[08:18:28] <amberlee[m]> once the guest kernel touches those memory pages the hypervisor cannot free them.
[08:18:31] <ayecee> pages from your executables and the libraries they're actively using
[08:19:13] <rascul> how do you know the io is using up the memory in the form of cache?
[08:19:17] <ayecee> which all have to be reloaded from disk every time you punt the page cache
[08:20:02] <amberlee[m]> i know its IO because a simple pipe of urandom into a file increases both the cache usage on the guest (per free) and the hypervisor process memory usage on the host.
[08:20:28] <ayecee> you know that part of it is io
[08:20:40] <amberlee[m]> a virtio-balloon solves that problem temporarily.

[08:21:49] <amberlee[m]> is there a way to set an absolute limit for the kernel cache size?
[08:21:56] <rascul> i suspect that what you're actually doing that sees an increase in memory usage isn't a simple pipe of urandom into a file
[08:22:11] <ayecee> sure, the limit is the amount of memory you've assigned to the vm
[08:22:18] <amberlee[m]> it shows up in free -m under cache.....
[08:22:48] <rascul> what would you like to do with the memory that is used for cache?

[09:37:14] <ayecee> amberlee[m]: what do you think of having smaller memory and a large swap? if the host's cache is fast enough to act as a page cache for the guest, it should just fly as a backing store for swap
[09:37:25] <ayecee> in those unusual cases where you need that extra memory

[10:27:22] <farkaan> Does anyone else feel Firefox has been quite crash-happy with the past few releases?
[10:27:59] <farkaan> I don't even run as many extensions as I used to and I no longer have hundreds of tabs split across multiple windows. It just randomly decides to crash for no reason.
[10:28:20] <farkaan> Is there a way to access the crash log? I'm running from a downloaded binary (copied into /opt)
[10:28:29] <Stryyker> Do you have AMd CPU? check for an update
[10:29:47] <farkaan> No
[10:29:51] <farkaan> It's an old core i5 intel
[10:30:01] <farkaan> Crash Reason     SIGSEGV
[10:30:12] <farkaan> It's segfaulting... weird
[10:30:28] <mlu> check your machine's stability
[10:30:44] <farkaan> Could be a disk failure?
[10:31:01] <sheep> did you set up microcode updates? and does it say which library or executable is segfaulting?
[10:31:25] <mlu> farkaan: just firefox or do other apps also crash randomly?
[10:31:28] <farkaan> sheep No it doesn't say much, the "crash report" is a web page and not a usual log
[10:31:30] <mlu> or are you just mostly using firefox?
[10:31:49] <sheep> check dmesg
[10:31:53] <farkaan> mlu I'm using firefox 90% of the time. Eclipse, vscode and the terminal take up the other 10%. They have never crashed.
[10:31:58] <mlu> since if it's "everything", you might want to check your temperatures and check for stability: it's probably between the RAM and CPU
[10:32:09] <mlu> hmm, sounds firefox-specific then
[10:32:11] <farkaan> I put a new SSD into this machine a month ago
[10:32:36] <Aarch64debian> firefox didnt crash for me,it just use lot mem and cache
[10:32:42] <mlu> farkaan: that shouldn't affect stability
[10:32:58] <farkaan> It does, the memory usage has spiked over the past 5 versions or so but the crashes are new Aarch64debian

[10:34:14] <farkaan> sheep: What is `libxul.so`? That's where it crashed
[10:34:26] <farkaan> Btw it crashed 3 times today
[10:34:55] <farkaan> And all those crashes were on YouTube (across different videos, not any particular url)
[10:35:05] <mlu> farkaan: XUL is Firefox's GUI system

[10:35:11] <farkaan> Oh yeah the XUL runner
[10:35:22] <mlu> farkaan: so the video controls, the tabs, etc.: that's all XUL
[10:35:27] <farkaan> Why would it crash on YouTube though
[10:35:42] <farkaan> I've opened a saved session worth 47 tabs (no YouTube) and it's doing fine
[10:35:50] <mlu> video decoding uses a special part of your hardware
[10:35:55] <farkaan> But I'm betting if I go to YouTube right now it will crash
[10:36:05] <mlu> in paritcular, the VDU has to map the decoded video to memory somewhere
[10:36:08] <mlu> and I imagine it's a bug with that
[10:36:22] <mlu> i.e. write the memory to a null pointer, etc. that's where you get the segfault
[10:36:26] <Aarch64debian> i dont even open above 10
[10:36:31] <farkaan> So I guess I'm missing something then. This is a debian netinstall, I'm always missing some library that I have to install whenever I sideload stuff mlu
[10:36:34] <mlu> probably a firefox bug specifically with your GPU
[10:36:47] <farkaan> GPU is intel
[10:36:48] <mlu> farkaan: no, I think it's just a bug
[10:36:54] <oops> sheep: the ps error is resolved after installing "procps", but airmon-ng can't set nic to monitor mode :  https://paste.centos.org/view/2f6435c9

[10:37:19] <farkaan> mlu: Yeah probably. I save all my tabs in a session but it's annoying when it eats up my private tabs (can't save those)
[10:37:30] <sheep> or there could be another reason

I would enforce files to have .extensions on a filesystem level so that you could not ever mistake a folder for a file or
[13:06:54] <Gaboradon> vice versa, extensionless files are one of the weirdest things, not that I have a big problem, but that's how it feels to a Windows geek.

[13:20:42] <Gaboradon> for comparison.

[13:36:27] <Gaboradon> So you can see, the first point is already something, major point that we have in common :)
[13:36:38] <Affliction> But yeah, by my observations, phone/tablets and their 'apps' have done far worse for user education (or lack thereof)
[13:37:04] <rustytaco> As far as 2k, again we ran a stripped down 2k with litestep (RAM savin from explorer.exe not running) and our application.

[13:39:15] <Gaboradon> for developers and power users that some little GUI for env tops the list, what should have been done ages ago
[13:39:45] <Sauvin> I found Windows 2k to be decently reliable, actually.

[13:46:46] <Gaboradon> rustytaco: That's it right there, the earlier reply you made, the first thing is that linux-people might have a wrong perception of Windows because they're not being told how Windows is like from poweruser/sysadmin point of view, secondly the reason a power user would want extensions for files is NOT to rely on them and NOT to know about magic-bits, thirdly the linux-opensource mentality seems to be focused so much on "what noobs will
[13:46:48] <Gaboradon> do", this is where a major disagreement is, many linux users are community driven contributors who care so much about other's who may not know so much, now this is perfectly fine and it's a healthy community, but it's not like that on Windows power user scene, you are meant to learn the proper way and that's it, no babysitting for novice users, so this was a huge shocker, I thought Linux was always even more geeky, sometimes it feels
[13:46:49] <Gaboradon> the opposite.
[13:46:49] <hexnewbie> I'm fine with some elements of the flat design, it's the lack of grey in modern themes and unchangeable padding (on 96 DPI screens) that gets me more

[14:29:11] <Sauvin> Lots of things in *nix are like that. Sed, for stream editor; awk for the surnames of the people who created it; gimp for "graphic image manipulation program" (or some such).

[17:55:06] <Psi-Jack> But, it's not limited. It's VERY powerful, and very capable.
[17:55:15] <mikebutash> I got it mostly to use with a 3d scanner
[17:55:22] <Psi-Jack> I have my iPad Pro 10" first gen of the Pro.
[17:55:28] <Dagmar> There are just sooo many low-spec Android tablets on the market tho... It's practically a torrent of brand new e-waste

[17:56:52] <mikebutash> I even tried an iphone for a few weeks as a result, but far too limiting for me.
[17:56:59] <Psi-Jack> Dagmar: That's pretty much why I went with the highest spec Fire HD in the 8". It was comparable to the Samsung Galaxy Tab A current model, but without some features (GPS), and with lower spec things (Camera, who cares anyway/)
[17:57:06] <Dagmar> Fire tablets shouldn't be compared to anything.  They're sold to be vending machines and nothing else.
[17:57:24] <Psi-Jack> mikebutash: Heh, I pretty much use iPhone, iPad, and iWatch most of the time.
[17:57:25] <mikebutash> buy everything amazon!
[17:57:28] <Dagmar> That they look like a tablet you can coerce some Android apps to run on doesn't mean they should be thought of as a general-purpose tablet
[17:58:12] <Psi-Jack> Heh, getting the Google Play Store on it was easy enough.
[17:58:28] <Dagmar> THey've got _just_ enough RAM and CPU run the ebook reader and sales app, to within the performance expectations Amazon finds to be appropriate, and not one bit more
[17:58:41] <mikebutash> my final limiter with the stupid iphone was I had to go onsite to a customer for weeks at a time on a project, and realized my iphone wouldn't let me tether to it.
[17:58:52] <Psi-Jack> Dagmar: Actually, I was able to play a rather intensive 3D game on mine.
[17:59:42] <Dagmar> Psi-Jack: Which I can assure you was not even a little bit of what Amazon had in mind when they were deciding how much to spend on designing it
[17:59:57] <mikebutash> of course they want you to buy every app, I bought some to replace quality free equivalents under android, whatever, but that they literally won't just let me nat out my phone using tethering was the last straw.

[18:01:56] <Psi-Jack> And now Lemmings, on this tablet, calls out to me. 😀
[18:01:56] <mikebutash> nope, some rabbid googling says that if your provider doesn't have some stupid web service telling the iphone it can tether, it will not let you.
[18:02:15] <mikebutash> otherwise it *can*

[18:05:07] <Dagmar> s/to/for/
[18:05:21] <mikebutash> If I used ATT, TMo, Verizon, whatever, they have the apple server that says "thou shalt tether!"

[18:06:29] <Psi-Jack> Heh, it's going to be interesting when I move to Canada, where none of those companies exist for cellular.
[18:06:35] <mikebutash> they allow it anyways with android

[18:07:04] <Psi-Jack> Eh, I'm not interested in Google Fi.
[18:07:05] <ayecee> don't know about use, but you sure can't sign up for google fi there
[18:07:10] <mikebutash> android doesn't care, it'll become a router for you.
[18:07:11] <Dagmar> mikebutash: By default Android doesn't care and will merrily let you tether over wifi, bluetooth, or USB
