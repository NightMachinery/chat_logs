[17:12:23] <Orbstheorem> TIL: What that 'dot' in the lower right corner means x)
[17:20:19] <afontain[m]> un nÅ“ud?
[17:22:06] <afontain[m]> si jamais, j'ai compris la signification de la flÃ¨che et des termes "Ã©metteur"/"collecteur", aussi
[17:22:24] <afontain[m]> en fait, c'est vachement logique et assez pratique
[17:23:49] <afontain[m]> mais ben on me l'a jamais expliquÃ© correctement, ou alors pas du tout jusqu'Ã  ce que tout devienne clair ce semestre
[17:41:30] <Orbstheorem> <afontain[m]> "un nÅ“ud?" <- Junction of  the source to the P+ bulk.
[17:41:47] <Orbstheorem> > <@afontain:gnugen.ch> un nÅ“ud?
[17:41:47] <Orbstheorem>  * Junction of the source to the P+ bulk.
[19:21:16] <afontain[m]> indeed
[19:22:01] <afontain[m]> and the arrow would be the P-"N" junction on that schematic?
[19:22:40] <afontain[m]> (sur le canal n dans un substrat p)
[19:26:26] <afontain[m]> you can't have a P+ substrate though, or it would be impossible to switch you transistor
[19:26:44] <afontain[m]> * you can't have a P+ substrate though, or it would be impossible to switch on your transistor
[19:29:00] <afontain[m]> Roos: if you want, I have 850 pages of slides and explainations fir that kind of stuff
[19:29:11] <afontain[m]> s/fir/for/
[19:30:39] <Orbstheorem> My usual constraint applies: Not enough time to look into everything that tickles my curiosity...
[19:30:59] <Orbstheorem> One of the reasons I love videos (or a good talk for that matter) is that the information bandwidth is much higher ^^
[19:31:28] <afontain[m]> :P
[19:32:14] <afontain[m]> It's hard to find good videos in terms of depth though, but at least it can give a good introduction
[19:33:08] <Orbstheorem> Such videos could be made :D
[19:36:37] <afontain[m]> Ï€R: do you have the same semiconductor physics course in EL btw?
[19:47:09] <afontain[m]> (Â« busy; no time Â» is a valid answer)
[19:47:33] <R[m]1234> <afontain[m]> "Ï€R: do you have the same..." <- We do have a couple courses, not the same though. Vids available on Switchtube are too long to summarize the content. I can recommend a book "Semiconductor Physics and Devices" from D. A. Neamen.
[19:48:29] <R[m]1234> afontain[m]: Good EE engineers always find time to chat about semiconductors. ;-)
[19:50:45] <afontain[m]> hehe
[19:51:23] <afontain[m]> I would expect you see that kind of stuff a bit more in depth though
[20:02:30] <R[m]1234> <afontain[m]> "I would expect you see that kind..." <- I guess we do but I don't know the precise list of topics your course covers. We saw ALL kinds of memory devices that exist. Even ones that do not. We talked about many nanoscale effects, 3D/multigates devices, Fin-FETs, SOI, TFETs, ...
