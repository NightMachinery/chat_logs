[06:56:31] <mariari> jmercouris: yeah fun fact if you go to application mode in forum fields, pasting works, without it you need to hit space then backspace
[06:56:38] <mariari> just tested it on proton mail
[06:57:09] <jmercouris> Fun fact indeed
[06:57:40] <mariari> actual useful trivia as I can enter text in non minibuffer text and force it to go through without having to do the janky space and backspace
[07:04:40] <mariari> jmercouris: I wonder if you could get application mode in the minibuffer that might fix that issue as well
[07:04:58] <mariari> the implications probably would lead a fix to the bug that causes this as well
[07:05:16] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[07:05:17] <jmercouris> Hm I think know based on what you said how to fix it
[07:05:26] <mariari> oh?
[07:05:40] <jmercouris> Just have to send a fake keypress to the GTK renderer when pasting or altering the text
[07:06:30] <mariari> I should make an issue about pasting in the minibuffer that tends to kill nyxt windows and buffers hard
[07:06:36] <mariari> just never got around to it

[17:55:13] <mariari> yeah it shouldn't. It dies after you paste and go to the start of the minibuffers... as the pasting actually corrupts the minibuffers if you type
[17:55:39] <mariari> xyz <paste> xyz goes away, and if you attempt to go to the start to add it back you've ruined the window
