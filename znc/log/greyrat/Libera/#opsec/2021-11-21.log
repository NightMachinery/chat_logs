[03:23:08] <Roey> o/ hello Joanna
[03:24:15] <Roey> Joanna: it can go 30 hour
[03:24:16] <Roey> hours
[03:24:46] <Roey> Since the RQ-4 is capable of conducting sorties lasting up to 30 hours long, scheduled maintenance has to be performed sooner than on other aircraft with less endurance. However, since it flies at higher altitudes than normal aircraft, it experiences less wear during flight.[62]

[16:09:34] <powerjungle> oh
[16:09:42] <powerjungle> wtf :D
[16:09:51] <powerjungle> sounds like a serious bug
[16:11:42] <jan6> I mean, it does expect to pull the ADB keys from the existing partition
[16:11:45] <jan6> so it makes sense
[16:11:57] <powerjungle> but should it brick like that?
[16:12:10] <jan6> more serious bug is that fastboot refused to flash the signed boot images, lol
[16:12:20] <jan6> or well, all images
[16:12:23] <jan6> other than recovery
[16:12:27] <jan6> which brick'd it
[16:12:36] <powerjungle> oh gotcha
[16:12:43] <jan6> I won't use huawei anymore, anyway, given how they closed the bootloader unlock
[16:12:52] <jan6> for no real reason
[16:13:18] <powerjungle> yeah fuck huawei, my last phone was that and I hated it for that reason
[16:13:28] <powerjungle> also a family member got one recently ungooglefied lol
[16:13:42] <powerjungle> and he needed play for the bank whatnot
[16:13:45] <jan6> I quite like the customizeability and other stuff
[16:14:00] <jan6> but no unlock, is just evil
[16:14:07] <powerjungle> yep
[16:14:34] <powerjungle> I don't want your half baked proprietary thing huawei, I want a half baked open source thing :D
[16:14:50] <jan6> now I have a fancy new moto g30, with nfc and fingerprint and otg and usb-c and yuuuge ram and plenty of storage and whatnots else
[16:14:58] <jan6> lol
[16:15:01] <jan6> also magisk!
[16:15:10] <powerjungle> nice
[16:15:47] <powerjungle> haven't changed my phone in a while it's a xiaomi lol
[16:16:01] <powerjungle> but at least it's running lineage
[16:16:08] <powerjungle> thanks for not being total dicks xiaomi
[16:16:21] <jan6> lol
[16:16:32] <jan6> I thought huawei was nice, but then they betrayed me
[16:16:49] <powerjungle> didn't they also have a big scandal when developing 5g lol
[16:16:55] <jan6> and since motorola mobility is now part of lenovo, then teeeechnically I have a lenovo phone and a lenovo laptop ;P
[16:17:14] <powerjungle> damn the full ecosystem
[16:18:00] <powerjungle> btw what happened with nokia lol
[16:18:16] <jan6> ded
[16:18:19] <powerjungle> probably
[16:18:39] <powerjungle> dug their own grave
[16:18:40] <jan6> they're just another name that lost their company, these days, just like motorola
[16:18:44] <powerjungle> with the whole windows stunt
[16:19:03] <jan6> they still make stuff like dumbphones, including 4g-dumbphones, and kaios-featurephones
[16:19:22] <powerjungle> oh wow didn't believe dumbphones are still produced
[16:19:23] <jan6> windows phone was irrelevant
[16:19:31] <jan6> they're not dumb, anymore
[16:19:49] <jan6> but stuff like https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/nokia-220-4g
[16:19:52] <SeaDough> ^ Nokia 220 4G
[16:20:12] <jan6> they actually make smartphones too, with android, now
[16:20:22] <jan6> including a 5g-capable one, huh
[16:20:40] <jan6> some of them are very cheap, others not so much
[16:20:41] <powerjungle> trying to revive
[16:20:49] <jan6> nah
[16:20:51] <jan6> they never died
[16:21:07] <powerjungle> I haven't seen anyone with a nokia recently, or I'm just not looking carefully
[16:21:14] <jan6> the latter, prolly
[16:22:00] <jan6> I've not seen nokia smartphones physically in stores, but I've seen several in e-stores and I've seen the aforementioned 4g-dumbphones, even bought one
[16:22:15] <jan6> it has a horribly ill-featured old opera browser, lol
[16:22:20] <powerjungle> since this is #opsec lemme get on topic for a sec, wonder if a company is making a really simple diy device for just connecting to cell towers and making calls
[16:22:31] <jan6> kinda sad opera died, and caved to chrome monopoly
[16:22:49] <jan6> well, there are projects, but no companies I know of
[16:22:50] <powerjungle> would be cool for privacy 'n such, although it'll be accused for supporting criminals again
[16:22:53] <powerjungle> as usual
[16:22:53] <jan6> there's stuff like PiPhones
[16:23:01] <jan6> which are literally a raspberry pi phone, lol
[16:23:21] <jan6> after all, you literally only need the gsm modem, and a cpu
[16:23:35] <powerjungle> ok the PiPhone is pretty close to that
[16:23:46] <jan6> you can even call and sms from a computer, if you get that adapter (or if your laptop has that builtin)

[16:25:15] <jan6> but some madmen went ahead and did EXACTLY THAT
[16:25:37] <jan6> they made a private network, for some event, like...prolly not defcon, but similar vein
[16:26:01] <powerjungle> sheesh
[16:26:03] <jan6> with custom network, custom sim cards, and custom apps on those sim cards, and free calls to the outside, through their network
[16:27:01] <powerjungle> that's so cool

[16:35:05] <jan6> all I've seen is pretty much only "don't use near medical or explosive devices, don't modify it or it might go out of spec"
[16:35:14] <jan6> ah
[16:35:55] <powerjungle> could they arrest you if it's used near a hospital for example without you realizing it's reaching them
[16:36:34] <iz> i think that's more to just make sure they don't get sued if interference makes something blow up or someone die
[16:37:55] <powerjungle> sorry for going a lot more offtopic, but now this reminds me of satelite orbits :D
[16:38:04] <powerjungle> can't imagine the regulation hell that goes on there
[16:38:21] <powerjungle> and if 2 satelites collide who do you blame?
[16:38:47] <iz> apparently, fairly regularly, amateur radio clubs get permission and launch satellites that are still up there
[16:39:00] <powerjungle> ...what :D
[16:39:02] <iz> i guess nasa has a master list of all telemetry data
[16:39:14] <iz> in college i used to be friends w/ an amateur radio guy
[16:39:36] <iz> and the club had a dish on top of one of the dorms, that had uplink/downlink w/ a packet modem and could aim it
[16:39:52] <iz> so that dude would just run sattrack in the computer lab and it would show all the satellites
[16:40:07] <iz> and he'd wait until one would be overhead, and go up there and connect to it
[16:40:25] <jan6> lol
[16:40:34] <jan6> yeah, it's not that hard to get a sattellite up
[16:40:36] <iz> usually, they are just running like a very basic BBS software, and it's got all these posts saying hello in every diff language w/ all these diff amateur radio call signs
[16:41:11] <jan6> especially if you get on one of the projects to send plenty of 'em up at once, it's not even prohbitatively expensive

[16:41:41] <iz> yeah, the amateur radio sats are tiny

[16:43:18] <jan6> everything needed for launching your very own space mission like a power supply, propulsion system and even communications capability."
[16:44:30] <powerjungle> but what about space debris?
[16:44:53] <mnemon> usually launched into orbits that decay fast
[16:45:18] <powerjungle> so short lifespan
[16:45:23] <iz> yeah
[16:45:32] <iz> also tiny
[16:45:44] <powerjungle> yeah but tiny things make a huge impact there right?
[16:45:46] <iz> so not even that much mass to make debris if there is an accident
[16:45:49] <powerjungle> because of the speed
[16:46:11] <iz> if they hit something, sure
[16:46:25] <iz> but the orbits are chosen in ways to try to make sure that doesn't happen
[16:46:25] <mnemon> powerjungle: yeah, but lke iz mentioned large objects will turn into large debris clouds which are hard to track
[16:46:53] <powerjungle> gotcha
[16:47:05] <powerjungle> you guys are blowing my mind today :D

[16:50:07] <jan6> lol, "hey kids, design a satellite for us!"
[16:50:51] <mnemon> jan6: it's already tracked using the existing satellites together with ground based instrumentation
[16:51:00] <jan6> cool
[16:52:13] <iz> i had this idea in college to try to look for gaps in all the nasa telemetry data where they are tracking stuff (they even track junk)
[16:52:19] <iz> to try to find spy satellites
[16:52:31] <iz> but it was useless, nothing really came of it
[16:52:47] <mnemon> can you even get access to the raw data?
[16:53:19] <iz> yeah, or at least you could in the 90s.. it was just a raw data download they provided and you could feed that data into sattrack
[16:53:21] <jan6> they'd probably fill in the gaps anyway
[16:53:32] <jan6> if there were any, even
[16:53:35] <iz> well, there are just lots of gaps
[16:53:42] <iz> too many to be useful
[16:54:19] <iz> cuz they can have diff heights also
[16:54:20] <jan6> if you know where to put a gap, you could just as well pretend there's "normal" data there
[16:54:45] <iz> and also, probably many spy sats would be geosync orbits
[16:55:12] <iz> well, until someone tries to uplink/downlink and finds nothing there
[16:55:17] <iz> i guess you could say it's junk
[16:55:37] <jan6> yeah
[16:56:00] <jan6> just pretend it's about average distribution of junk in that area
[16:56:27] <iz> well, it turned out that isn't even somthing to be concerned about
[16:57:16] <jan6> sure
[17:00:40] <mnemon> iz: could calculate orbits that are always in the gaps to reduce the possibilities
[17:01:46] <mnemon> also they could just remove the data for any observations to hide 'em :(
[17:06:43] <Joanna> That space junk seems like a big problem that can destroy whatever is sent up to retrieve it.
[17:07:45] <iz> it's one of those things that could become a big problem but isn't anywhere near that yet
[17:08:02] <Joanna> I imagine it’s most likely not magnetic
[17:08:20] <iz> the nightmare scenario is so much space junk orbiting that nothing can launch w/out getting destroyed and adding to the junk in orbit
[17:08:44] <mnemon> Joanna: not really, it's a problem when different orbits intersect, if the retriever is in the same orbit it doesn't have the relative velocity to do much.
[17:09:25] <Joanna> Maybe but it seems like a very expensive problem to solve
[17:10:11] <mnemon> in the sense that sending anything with sufficient manuevering capability to the orbit is very expensive, definitely 
[17:10:44] <Joanna> Aren’t satellites made with valuable rare earth minerals that are in short supply? It seems wasteful not to recycle them.
[17:12:02] <mnemon> not really, and the bits that are are not made in quantities that matter compared to terrestial waste
[17:12:20] <mnemon> *the bits that contain those are not made ...
[17:12:45] <iz> yeah, the amount of rare earth minerals in orbit is negligible
[17:14:18] <iz> recycle from the excess of old playstations on earth first
[17:15:24] <Joanna> I bet someday people will be mining landfills for all the things that should have been recycled instead of thrown away...
[17:16:20] <Joanna> I’m surprised that space craft don’t have a lot of rare earth minerals I. Them
[17:21:06] <Joanna> Silver is the most conductive metal I wonder if it is used for spacecraft
[17:24:08] <Joanna> jan6: how did  they get the operating system onto the phone to begin with? 
[17:27:04] <iz> there's really not much reason to maximize conductivity in spacecraft..  something w/ sufficient conductivity and less weight and cost would be better, like copper
[17:29:04] <Joanna> From what I can remember from a tour of the jet propulsion laboratory the space craft was solar powered. Satellites are probably different though
[17:29:48] <Joanna> Since these were built by government there was probably plenty of money to spend on them.
[17:30:54] <Joanna> I’m thinking more of space craft to explore the solar system
[17:36:52] <iz> even then, excess conductivity at the cost of more weight isn't useful, it's actually a disadvantage

[19:17:25] <jan6> SOMEONE does
[19:18:33] <jan6> I'm pretty sure the chip maker puts on a basic bootloader, and using that, the phone factory can flash with USB, or something

[19:40:20] <Joanna> jan6: I have no idea how all that stuff works . Maybe they do something to it to make it only install once but still there should be a way to fix it.
[19:48:04] <jan6> problem is *I* was stupid
[19:48:05] <jan6> lol
[19:48:45] <jan6> if you tore it open and did specific stuff to specific test pads, with appropriate tooling, I'm sure you could do something
[19:49:15] <jan6> but not through usb, the only available interface, when it doesn't get anywhere when booting
[19:50:34] <Joanna> Speaking of which one of my usb flash drives stopped being detected when I plug it in. No idea why
[19:52:20] <jan6> only one?
[19:52:24] <jan6> in linux?
[19:54:35] <Joanna> I can’t remember if it’s the one I got salt water in but that hasn’t stopped them before. It doesn’t work on windows Mac or Linux. Sometimes when I unplug it the computer makes a sound or I see the thing asking if I want to use in windows or Mac flash for a second
[19:54:59] <Joanna> The other ones still work
[19:55:27] <jan6> on linux you can always see the logs
[19:55:46] <Joanna> It’s like it doesn’t detect it
[19:55:48] <jan6> like, does the OS recognize it's even attached? does it then recognize it as a storage device?
[19:55:53] <jan6> oof
[19:56:08] <jan6> dmesg would show if the OS detects "something's plugged in now"
[19:56:20] <Joanna> No indication it’s plugged in so far as I know
