[00:00:25] <d_bot_> <Continuation Calculus> by any chance, anyone knows how to tell if a server launched from cohttp has started?

[00:16:27] <d_bot_> <Continuation Calculus> debug messages are not printed to stdout
[00:16:39] <d_bot_> <Continuation Calculus> i made it so that they are written to a file instead
[00:16:43] <d_bot_> <Continuation Calculus> but doesn't tell me much
[00:17:20] <d_bot_> <Continuation Calculus> there is a request made, and the server doesn't see it, so nothing happens / is written by the server
