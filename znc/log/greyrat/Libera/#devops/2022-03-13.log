[01:52:15] <rawtaz> grr im working with someone who puts "2022: " as prefix in all the issue titles on github >_<
[01:52:19] <rawtaz> moronic!
[01:53:20] <slaughter> well that's a new one to me
[01:53:24] <slaughter> Did you ask why
[01:53:27] <slaughter> You should ask why
[01:54:17] <rawtaz> i just sent a mail asking why, informing them that every issue already has date and time info, and gave the examples of the syntax for created:2022 and created:<2022, and also mentioned labels (using the word "metadata" as a hint).
[01:54:27] <rawtaz> i hate stupidity like that
[01:54:48] <rawtaz> its just polluting our working environment! :P
[01:55:35] *** Quits: justsomeguy (~justsomeg@user/justsomeguy) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[01:55:37] <slaughter> Maybe the code is shit and they're hoping that reminding people it's 2022 will earn them some sympathy
[01:55:53] <slaughter> "2022 amirite anyway uh works on my machine"
[01:56:03] <rawtaz> lol
[01:56:49] <rawtaz> i have an interesting case with that project by the way
[01:56:53] <rawtaz> if you want to listen?
[01:57:37] <slaughter> Hit me with it
[01:57:41] <rawtaz> i will
[01:57:50] <rawtaz> please put on this latex suit while i go get my lubricants
[01:58:37] <rawtaz> so its a php project, writen by someone who isnt a programmer at all (spaghetti code deluxe, no security, unfathomable var names, etc), but that ARE a true problem solver so they have actually managed to produce a good looking web application.
[01:59:10] <rawtaz> i was brought on to help them get some non-basic things solved and fixed and also for more manpower to move it forward.
[02:00:06] <rawtaz> this guy im helping, he is the one who wrote it *for* a customer of his own. so theres his customer that the system is built for, theres him, and im consulting for him.
[02:01:22] <rawtaz> so, once i realized how shit the code is, and how fragile it all is due to that and lack of architecture and security etc etc, i started gently telling him about some of it and over some time i have gotten him to realize that it is seriously suboptimal, full of security issues, a complete mess and that every thing we do with it takes about 5 times longer than it would have if it was proper code.
[02:01:47] <rawtaz> however, i've used the word prototype so thats what he considers this to be, which justifies a bit of the mess and is something he can use with his customer.
[02:02:31] <rawtaz> he started hinting and using the concept of prototype with his customer since a while but the situation is this: the customer has no idea what the mess behind the facade is, and they are just plowing money into this project to get it "done"
[02:03:16] <rawtaz> what that means in practice is that they are finally testing it actively, but theyre asking us to fix small details, be it cosmetic or functional stuff, that moves them toward a finalized product. this includes new features as well.
[02:04:43] <rawtaz> so the problem here is that despite me having told my customer that this will not end well, there WILL be a point where what they ask from us simply cannot be solved without serious rewriting (e.g. multi-tenancy, language support, publishing it online given the security aspect, GDPR, etc etc), he has of course not told them this in clear text, and seems hesitant to do so :)
[02:06:02] <rawtaz> anyway so i feel ive done what i can, ive really talked with him about this many times and he does understand the situation. ive told him that the more time and money they put into this, the more sour the point where you have to tell them that this shit needs to be rewritten will be.
[02:06:32] <rawtaz> the sooner it would be rewritten in a proper framework with proper code, the better. now theyre just spending money on the fire basically.
[02:07:35] <rawtaz> the only thing i havent done yet is simply telling HIS client that "guys, this thing isnt what you think". but i feel i cant really do that because after all he is the one that hired me, so my loyalty should be with him (i mean my customer, not his customer).
[02:07:40] <rawtaz> silly situation.
[02:07:49] <slaughter> Phew yeah that's a weird one
[02:07:57] <rawtaz> and its no fun to work with either lol. its like 90% detective work and 10% programming
[02:08:00] <rawtaz> yeah :D
[02:08:00] <slaughter> I assume the money they're pumping in isn't enough to bring in more devs
[02:08:13] <rawtaz> it wouldnt help to bring in more devs. all this project needs is a rewrite :)
[02:08:37] <slaughter> With more devs a rewrite might be a more feasible thing I guess
[02:08:42] <rawtaz> then again, from a pragmatic view what is in here now actually works.
[02:09:01] <rawtaz> yeah but also more expensive. one or two devs can rewrite this, no problem. its not a large project :)
[02:09:54] <slaughter> Pragmatism can be the death of you, careful ;)
[02:10:09] <rawtaz> yep theres a balance to everything
[02:10:42] <rawtaz> i guess what i meant by that is that if they were to not go after more features, and only use this internally, by themselves, then it would be "fine" to leave it as it is now.
[02:11:14] <rawtaz> the core of the problem is that the end customer has grand plans for this, selling it as a SaaS to other companies and so on, with more features. and that will only go to hell lol
[02:12:15] <kubblai> This is why php has a bad rep rawtaz :)
[02:12:19] <slaughter> Ah yeah well you gotta stop that in it's tracks
[02:12:19] <rawtaz> anyway i decided to just not care much anymore, i have done my best to give the advice that i believe is the correct one, and if my customer doesnt want to make use of that and just let the end customer go about their ignorance, then fine. that is his choice and not something im gonna burn a bridge over.
[02:12:38] <rawtaz> after all, i do get some other highly relevant work through this guy, so if theres any bridge i should burn its with the end customer there, not my customer.
[02:13:08] <rawtaz> kubblai: this has nothing to do with php at all, i can write you super duper nice php code ;) its a bad programmer product, thats all :P you can do the same with any language
[02:13:52] <rawtaz> actually the end user is pretty special too, they dont listen at all to what we're telling them so
[02:14:00] <kubblai> Yeah I agree although my experience with php has involved many bad programmers
[02:14:17] <rawtaz> things like "instead of making everything 100% perfect, you should just start testing stuff when its 90% perfect, so we can focus on the main/important things"
[02:14:34] <rawtaz> kubblai: yeah, that is indeed a problem, lots of bad not-even-programmers out there :/
[02:14:49] <rawtaz> and thos fucking idiots give us *real* programmers a super bad reputation often. thats a huge problem
[02:15:01] <rawtaz> and they fill the market with utter junk that the rest of us has to fix
[02:15:36] <kubblai> I admit Iâ€™m a terrible programmer so I stick to stuff like tf and scripts
[02:15:43] <rawtaz> haha
[02:15:50] <rawtaz> i guess that depends on what you compare with :D
[02:58:10] <slaughter> You can be a bad programmer and not write shit code
[02:58:35] <slaughter> There's enough guides and resources out there to follow that will keep you from shooting yourself in the foot
[02:58:51] <slaughter> But bad programmers usually aren't just bad because they write shit code
[02:59:51] <slaughter> Complintarily, you can write great amazing code but still be a bad programmer

[03:04:47] <rawtaz> not entirely sure i follow your reasoning there :D
[03:05:16] <rawtaz> if you dont know how to write code, you are not a programmer. so just following resources out there simply wont work. at best you copy/paste stuff and make it work just fine, but you are still not even close to being a programmer in this case.
[03:05:47] <rawtaz> how is someone writing great code still a bad programmer?

[16:58:15] <dodo> the idea that devops existed without security in mind is absurd anyway
[17:00:18] <rawtaz> yeah lol
[17:00:51] <rawtaz> lantech19446: looking into how to "secure" containers is one key thing though, i would say
[17:01:07] <rawtaz> the amount of security minded container images out there is... slim as fek.
[17:01:27] <rawtaz> also how to audit them and the supply chain is good to have understanding of, of course

[18:11:03] <randompleb> Given a scenario, where you maintain about 20+ helm charts... how do you deploy them onto the customer environment? Currently, we run a shell script that runs "helm upgrade --install" for _each_ microservice but that feels tedious. I read about orca, a tool that is supposed to handle the deployment of an _entire_ application (in our case, 20+ microservices). Can anyone confirm if this is a good
[18:11:05] <randompleb> idea or not? How do _good_ devops team deploy their application on a kubernetes cluster?

[20:14:19] <dodo> what does your network consist of?
[20:15:13] <lantech19446> Several servers about 45 workstations 2 unifi wireless networks 7 unifi switches and a udm
[20:16:02] <dodo> do you have the basics covered, like system hardening, updates etc? 
[20:17:25] <lantech19446> Updates yes I have Ansible handling that and I have our guest wifi on a vlan but no real hardening to speak of just gpos to keep patrons from doing shit I don't want them too. 
[20:19:51] <dodo> ok, hard to tell, but you might want to look into physical security, creating subnets for user groups, traffic filtering/blocking, ..
[20:20:02] <dodo> people in #networking could have a few pointers where to start
[20:21:12] <lantech19446> Also about to get a checkpoint firewall so we're cipa compliant for erate and that will provide edge security
[20:21:54] <lantech19446> Ok I'm already in there I'll bring it up when I'm home again
[20:22:03] <dodo> not sure what cipa is, but it sounds like they should have a checklist for stuff you should implement ;)

[20:23:31] <dodo> oh, ok
[20:23:37] <dodo> sounds like content filters?
[20:23:48] <dodo> also, those workstations probably run windows?
[20:24:36] <dodo> there's also #security
[20:24:50] <lantech19446> Mostly a filter yes but I didn't want a DNS solution so I went with a next gen firewall and yes mostly windoze also some Linux
