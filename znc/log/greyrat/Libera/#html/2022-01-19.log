[02:20:09] * tfisgnag is wondering if with his poor knowledge of the English language and of the html jargon he will be able to explain what he is trying to achieve.
[02:20:45] <tfisgnag> I am trying to learn what a special nested list is called.
[02:21:40] <tfisgnag> It is a ordered list that is nested inside a list item of another ordered list.
[02:22:25] <tfisgnag> But, this nested list has numbers that depend on the number of the list in which they are nested.
[02:22:40] <tfisgnag> For example
[02:23:46] <tfisgnag> Home This page has a link to itself and also a link to the next item of this same list.Learning the ShellThis page has the following link CONTENTS.What is "the Shell"
[02:25:00] <tfisgnag> Sorry  don't take into account my example. It is unreadable. I will try to show you using some other method.
[02:26:03] <tfisgnag> The first item of the list should read like this:
[02:26:45] <tfisgnag> 1.Home
[02:27:40] <tfisgnag> The firs item of the nested should read 1.1 CONTENTS
[02:28:20] <tfisgnag> The second item of the list should read like this
[02:28:59] <tfisgnag> 2. Learning X
[02:29:40] <tfisgnag> The first item of the nested list in the second item of the list should read
[02:30:18] <tfisgnag> 2.1 Basic data
[02:31:54] <tfisgnag> In other words, each item of the nested list should start with the number of the list item in which it is nested followed by a dot and then by its own number as a nested list.
[02:35:57] <tfisgnag> I have found that https://html.spec.whatwg.org/ has (under the tittle :
[02:36:26] <tfisgnag> Full table of contents) the sort of list whose name I am trying to learn.
[02:37:06] *** Quits: molt (~molt@178-222-245-206.static.isp.telekom.rs) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[02:38:16] <tfisgnag> So if somebody is willing to help me, somebody can take a look at that list a tell me what is the technical name that is used to describe it.
[02:38:36] <tfisgnag> * at that list and tell
[02:39:40] <lilmonkey`> Err, the name of a list where the items of a nested list specifically include the parent item's number? Why would there be a name for that?
[02:43:48] <tfisgnag> lilmonkey` Thank you for asking.
[02:45:13] <tfisgnag> The answer to your question is: to distinguish it from the list where the nested list doesn't begin with the number of the list in which it is nested.
[02:46:29] <tfisgnag> lilmonkey` Please take a look at the list that is under the tittle "Full table of contents" at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/
[02:47:50] <tfisgnag> its a good example of the sort of list I would like to know its exact name. Because it is different from the lists that at least my system calls "nested list"
[02:49:03] <lilmonkey`> I really don't know why you insist on this having a specific name. You know not every idea, concept, or variation on an idea or concept has a unique name, right?

[02:59:38] <tfisgnag> Knowing the specific name the former sort of lists has I will be able to find the subject in the internet and learn how to make one without bothering others with my questions about something I even don't know its name.
[03:09:54] <lilmonkey`> Bro, hate to break it to ya, but it probably doesn't have a specific name. To make something like this in an automated way on the front-end, you might be able to use CSS counters (ask in #css), or you can automate it where the HTML is generated of course.
[03:12:25] <nbjoerg> tfisgnag: basically, they are just different styles of printing the enumerator
[03:12:38] <nbjoerg> tfisgnag: not different styles of list
[03:15:05] <nbjoerg> tfisgnag: e.g. consider https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Counter_Styles/Using_CSS_counters#nesting_counters
[03:15:50] <tfisgnag> nbjoerg . Thank you .I use these <ol type="1,A,a,I,i"> types. But none of them renders the sort of type I have described. What sort of type should I use if I want to achieve that sort of nests?
[03:16:17] <nbjoerg> did you look at the example I pointed to?
[03:19:23] <tfisgnag> nbjoerg  Only a swift look after I had posted. I will take my time and read it carefully now and eventually ask again if I don't find the way to solve my problem. Thank you very much.
[03:19:32] <tfisgnag> lilmonkey than you too.
[03:19:45] <tfisgnag> lilmonkey'
[03:20:08] <tfisgnag> lilmonkey`
[03:21:05] <nbjoerg> basically, scroll down to the last example above the "Specifications" section
[03:21:45] <tfisgnag> nbjoerg Thanks(y)
