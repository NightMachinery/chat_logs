[00:00:41] <CrtxReavr> I think the whole universe used to use cvs.
[00:01:07] <grym> i learned the value of distributed versioning tools after a particularly harrowing weekend involving a dying RAID and a svn server that hadn't been backed up in years but had years upon years of research data on it
[00:01:08] <sveinse> today that's git
[00:01:16] <bjs> if anything, git is at least proof that you don't have to be first to market to make good software people will use
[00:01:32] <CrtxReavr> For a long time, the FreeBSD project used svn for source management, and continued to use cvs for release management.

[00:32:35] <SnoopJ> I thought that Ken Shirriff had talked about BCD on his blog before, but I can only find incidental references to it in his articles about the machines that used it
[00:33:56] <Helle> I mean a big reason BCD was usable on the big iron is that they where microcoded to all hell and back, so they could do BCD with VARIABLE length numbers in "hardware"
[00:34:14] <SnoopJ> yea, and this was well before word sizes stabilized

[00:35:25] <SnoopJ> Helle, right, that's why there's a hardware control for it

[02:58:02] <SnoopJ> a1fa, when you reshape, the new size (the product of the new shape) has to be the same as the old size.

[02:58:19] <a1fa> i think i had 1 there, let me check
[02:58:20] <SnoopJ> looks like maybe you're reshaping a single channel rather than 3, because 30625 * 3 is 91875

[03:00:16] <a1fa> :0
[03:00:28] <grym> (probably)
[03:00:35] <SnoopJ> if so, this can only be a single channel

[03:01:41] <SnoopJ> a1fa, can you share the complete error report with us at https://bpa.st? The rest of the report is helpful information.
[03:01:42] <a1fa> maybe the grayscale is trowing it off
[03:01:42] <Repiphany> 30625 isn't divisible by 3
[03:02:15] <a1fa> SnoopJ: https://github.com/PrayagBhakar/TensorFlow-Image-Classifier
[03:02:20] <grym> cv2 can convert to greyscale, however
[03:02:25] <a1fa> i used this to create the model
[03:03:04] <SnoopJ> a1fa, okay, that's partly helpful. It's not something I can use to help you without the complete error report, though.
[03:03:49] <a1fa> let me post the test code
[03:04:03] <SnoopJ> The model may expect a 3-channel image. If your input images are a single channel (you mentioned grayscale?) you might need to convert them to a 3-channel form first.
[03:04:16] <a1fa> i am using a same picture from model

[04:36:01] <lseactuary> also iterators or sequences is confusing me. var = [] and var = [n for n in range(10)] is a sequence vs var = iter(n for n in range(10)) and var = (n for n in range(10)) which is an iterator?
[04:37:45] <SnoopJ> lseactuary, ValueError is a good choice when the type is correct but the value itself is problematic, yes.

[04:39:26] <SnoopJ> lseactuary, re: iterator vs. sequence, an iterator is an object that does the actual walking along some iterable object, a sequence is an *iterable* object (i.e. one you can call iter() on) that can also be indexed by integers and fed to len()
[04:39:43] <lseactuary> is the examples i gave correct?
[04:40:24] <SnoopJ> the first one produces a list, and lists are sequences. The second one produces a generator iterator, which is a type of iterator, yes.

[04:44:56] <Repiphany> Use ranges instead of trying to check for float equality
[04:45:00] <lseactuary> if you want something ordered, you need a list, or tuple is ok?
[04:45:04] <lseactuary> i think we can only sort a list.
[04:45:31] <Tritium> a1fa: can you tell us what you mean by index number?
[04:45:50] <SnoopJ> lseactuary, you can call sorted() on either, but only a list can be sorted in-place. Tuples are immutable.
[04:46:10] <lseactuary> aha
[04:46:29] <lseactuary> A module-level constant holding objects representing types of animals, in order, e.g., Dog, Cat, Mouse, Bird -- is better as a tuple?
[04:46:31] <SnoopJ> well, I guess you'd have to call tuple(sorted(...)) to get a tuple back
[04:46:43] <lseactuary> lists are better where things change?
[04:46:44] <a1fa> Tritium: i want to know the postion number of the element in the list
[04:46:48] <SnoopJ> lseactuary, it depends on whether the thing should be allowed to change, yes.
[04:46:58] <SnoopJ> a tuple is a good choice for a constant sequence

[07:22:38] <songd> oh cool no
[07:23:34] <cowsay-moo> Question.. I was playing around with PyGObject/Gtk today.. I changed "gi.require_version("Gtk", "3.0")" to 4.0, and then decided to go back to 3.0. Now every time I try to run my project, it says "Namespace Gtk is already loaded with version 4.0" ... how do I "unload" 4.0 so I can return to 3.0?
[07:23:37] <SnoopJ> it's apparently resting directly on something in libxml2 https://lxml.de/parsing.html#parsing-html
[07:24:14] <SnoopJ> I don't have a good sense of how tolerant it is of malformed documents vs. BeautifulSoup, but it's certainly more actively worked on, so I imagine it's as good or better
[07:24:16] <songd> I've not done any scraping in a while actually, but last time I did lxml directly it didn't like really messy html. things may have changed since then - could be much nicer now

[07:45:04] <songd> I think the biggest problems were the XHTML declaration at the top combined with javascript copypasta that broke the xml rules

[07:45:42] <songd> cool thanks
[07:45:56] <SnoopJ> anyway, I also remembered lxml being a little touchy about HTML (and having gotten a lot better), but couldn't trust my remembrance

[07:46:40] <SnoopJ> there's still some API in lxml.html for hooking it into BeautifulSoup, so you're not necessarily locked out of switching if you do bump into documents that it chokes on

[08:51:27] <eyepeetee> hi, what is the best way to locate the source of memory leaks in a program?
[08:51:28] <han-solo> KnowledgeShark: is that the only thing that you are writing to the file ?
[08:52:03] <KnowledgeShark> han-solo: Yup! Just the file count python variable
[08:52:57] <KnowledgeShark> That's nice though, if you can specifcy file.write(int(variable)) file.write(str(variable)), etc. if that's what I just learned from Repiphany.
[08:53:00] <han-solo> `with open(fname, 'w') as f: json.dump({"count": count}, f)`
[08:53:12] <eyepeetee> it almost seems like garbage collection isn't working quite right. probably that isn't the case though (or is it)
[08:53:39] <han-solo> now you could just load that using json, without having to again `int(f.read())` and stuff
[08:53:48] <KnowledgeShark> han-solo: I am not using json.dump (already extracted all json data using SQLAlchemy).
[08:54:06] <KnowledgeShark> I need to manage the files in different parts of my program.
[08:54:13] <KnowledgeShark> and file information
[08:54:14] <han-solo> okay
[08:54:23] <KnowledgeShark> han-solo: I appreciate that , though!
[08:57:16] <KnowledgeShark> Repiphany: Worked Perfect! Thank you very very much! Brilliant!
[08:57:36] <bpalmer> Given x=1, the f-string f'{x=}' == 'x=1' ; where is the x= syntax described? I've been reading through PEP 498 and even the Format Specification Mini-Language in the string package , but I'm having trouble seeing how/where it's defined.
[08:58:03] <Repiphany> bpalmer: It wasn't part of the original f-string specification
[08:58:13] <han-solo> it's in 3.9, or 3.8 i think
[08:58:24] <bpalmer> aha

[14:32:42] <avu> Masklin__Gurder: and in Python, there's only objects and objects are things that always have exactly one type and in the general case have attributes (like methods for example)
[14:33:11] <Yhg1s> Masklin__Gurder: what makes it an object is how Python treats it. What you can do with it in Python.
[14:33:13] <han-solo> generally an object is something that have attributes and methods, i guess
[14:33:48] <avu> methods are attributes
[14:33:56] <Yhg1s> Masklin__Gurder: Python doens't have variables-as-containers the way C does; each thing is an object, which means it has a type and can be passed around. In C terms, you can think of Python variables to all be pointers to structs.
[14:34:50] <avu> again, I don't thin comparisons to C are useful when talking to somebody who doesn't know C. Sorry I started that. :)

[14:47:56] <rubin55> Masklin__Gurder: One way you could look at it, is that in languages that treat, say, foo="bar" not as an object, foo is simply a pointer to a  memory address + length indicator where you would find the characters b, a, r. If a language treats something as an object, that means it usually points to a more complex structure that can have all kinds of handy behaviour (methods, things to execute) and (meta)data (extra attributes)

[17:22:20] <matsaman> no way, cgi is great
[17:22:29] <marduk> ultimately it comes from the http request which is strings (maybe bytes) so you can always store the string.

[18:55:33] <mav`rik> sudorm: "It depends" is sadly the answer. There are many kinds of AWS lambda, from the almost typical "thing accessible via HTTP" through to SQS/SNS event handlers, Lambda@Edge stuff for CloudFront, etc.
[18:55:57] <wyre> mav`rik, thank you; I guess this https://pypi.org/project/pypi-simple/ could also work, ... however I'm wondering if I could just do http requests directly to pypi.org/simple 🤔
[18:56:06] <sudorm> mav`rik, ok I see! What is the "level 101" way to do it?
[18:56:33] <jinsun> Jong: but it works only for python code I think (same as your inspect based solutions), and python modules may not be python code
