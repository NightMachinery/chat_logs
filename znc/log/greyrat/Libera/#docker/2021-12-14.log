[00:10:59] <Tach> wasn't it that you could ping any docker container from within it's host ?
[00:11:09] <Tach> overlay network or not ?
[00:13:25] <rawtaz> not sure, i dont think i ever tried that

[00:34:32] <iffraff> rawtaz: so, to followup I had a volume who's relative path was incorrect and thus overwriting the app folder. This is why it was happening only when I did the copy to omg folder. Thats where the volume was writing. :(
[00:34:59] <rawtaz> you mean you havd a volumes: entry which mounted the volume at /app i take it?
[00:36:09] <Tach> It seems not but I was in the full understanding that I could ping overlay networks from the host as well
[00:36:34] <iffraff> yes basically volume: /app:home/omg/app  so when I copied to omg/app it was killed by the incorrect path being mapped to it.  but when I didn't copy to omg, and just looked at home/app it was fine.
[00:37:57] <rawtaz> ok
[00:38:08] <rawtaz> glad it worked out
[00:38:21] <iffraff> thanks for bareing with me

[01:51:25] <zumba_addict> I'm studying how my previous officemate built Sonarqube in the container. He didn't use Sonarqube's docker image but instead he downloads a zip of sonarqube that he extracts in the container. He made a custom image for our company. Now I need to upgrade it. I'm reading SonarQube's upgrade doc and it looks like I can do (1) docker exec to the
[01:51:25] <zumba_addict> container (2) download the sonarqube zip (3) stop the sonarqube running process (4) rename old sonarqube directory (5) rename newly downloaded and extracted sonarqube to the right one (6) update config files so it points to the right db (6) execute run.sh so it starts sonarqube
[01:51:32] *** Joins: itok (sid418430@id-418430.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[01:51:54] <zumba_addict> However, I am worried that once I stop sonarqube while I am in the container, the docker container might stop and I'll get kicked out
[01:52:10] <ada_> each host can route to an overlay ip, the host acts as a router.  but I also wouldn't really put too much stock into `ping` failing - for example, trying to ping a container on an overlay from a different host should probably fail
[01:52:13] <ada_> Tach: ^
[01:52:46] <ada_> Tach: I also don't find much reason to actually *use* a container IP, since the container IPs are temporary and there's a DNS mechanism for resolving container names to their IPs
[01:53:21] <rawtaz> zumba_addict: if the process you are stopping is the one set as the ENTRYPOINT in the image or compose, then yes :D
[01:53:42] <ada_> Tach: like, if you were trying to make sure that an overlay network is working correctly, ping a container from another container on the same network.  that should always work as expected
[01:53:49] <rawtaz> zumba_addict: why do you have to do it that way, cant you just modify the Dockerfile and rebuild it? i mean you need an updated image sooner or later anyway, no?
[01:54:06] <ada_> Tach: docker engine will handle assigning an overlay subnet on its own; it takes them from a configurable pool of possible subnets
[01:54:29] <Tach> ada_ yes that works, but I was thinking about it as it looked like isolated and I thought, yeah!! local/overlay overlap is possible D
[01:54:30] <Tach> :D
[01:54:58] <ada_> "isolation" happens by virtue of the "wiring" I would still make sure that they don't overlap
[01:55:21] <Tach> yes I will
[01:55:22] <ada_> like, if your lan is 192.168.x.x/24, then you must not have any overlay in that range.  docker engine should handle that.
[01:55:36] <Tach> yes
[01:55:51] <ada_> the only time I really have customers/users that need to chnage the default overlay pool is if their infra is in the 172.x.x.x block because I think that's the default that docker uses
[01:55:57] <Tach> I was wondering about local docker range and overlay
[01:55:59] <ada_> s/infra/LAN/
[01:56:08] <Tach> I own the internet, no worries
[01:56:19] <Tach> I'n Ripe/IANA and the rest
[01:56:30] <ada_> the only place where overlap is "allowed" is in the local scope networks
[01:57:00] <ada_> for example, on Host A, if you have a bridge driver network (local scope) in the 172.16.x.x range, then you could conceivable have a Host B with the same subnet for a different local scope network
[01:57:01] <Tach> is there ? How so ?
[01:57:09] <Tach> Oh yes for sure
[01:57:19] <Tach> I thought you ment on the same host
[01:57:20] <ada_> thats the only place I would allow some overlap;  all other cases should not
[01:57:29] <ada_> right on

[07:34:08] <sudomann> trying to use buildkit to spit out an image for x86_64 and arm64. I pass the flag `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` and now I have even reduced it to `--platform linux/amd64` yet somehow it still crashes with this in the error message: qemu-aarch64: Could not open '/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1': No such file or directory
[07:34:26] <sudomann> The host is x86_64. How can this be?

[16:40:55] <sudomann> Then I'm still strying to make sense of the part where we create the manifest and push it. The outcome is still several distinct tags. I dont know why that article was made.
[16:41:18] <minimal> sudomann: different places using different terminology for the same thing. The same way "arm64" and "aarch64" are used in different places to refer to the same thing
[16:41:23] <sudomann> The goal of multiarch is to be able to have one tag which offers different variants right?
[16:42:07] <sudomann> which offers variants for several platforms*
[16:42:10] <minimal> sudomann: correct
[16:43:38] <sudomann> Might i be missing something in that blog post? Perhaps the manifest-latest tag would have all the variants included in it, but they are also independently available via their own tags?
[16:44:05] <minimal> sudomann: in docker terminology these are (some) of the platforms: linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7, linux/i386, linux/amd64
[16:44:33] <sudomann> yep, I am targetting only amd64 and arm64
[16:45:04] <minimal> sudomann: you mean linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 - that's how buildx refers to them :-)
[16:47:12] <minimal> Its been a while since I looked "behind the scenes" as I use buildx but, yes, I believe each of the per-arch images has a unique tag and then the "generic" image references each of them also

[18:04:27] <tabakhase> that is, depending on what "issues" entails for ya ;-)

[18:12:26] <ExeciN> Hi people. Is there a special hostname that resolves to the host? Like if I have a service running on the host listening on localhost, is there a way for a container to connect to it?
[18:12:44] <selckin> eqw: a docker image is just a (layered) set of files and instructions with one to run by default, just like downloading a tar.gz unpacking it and running it
[18:13:17] <tabakhase> ExeciN on mac there is - i think the "newest" docker-for-windows has that to... but "better" is - just ship it in... - worst case, "lookup the gateway of eth0 in the container, thats your host"
[18:13:39] <eqw> selckin: I'm wondering if I can download and unpack it manually
[18:14:55] <rawtaz> eqw: all you have to do is inspect the Dockerfile, and of course make sure that the image you run is actually produced from that Dockerfile. if you have those piece of information, you can determine if what you have in there is safe or not
[18:15:19] <rawtaz> its no different from having some other type of package and bill of materials - you have to look at the contents and determine your stance on it :)

[20:24:23] <iffraff> Hi, I have an api project and service project both in their own dir. I spin them up using docker-compose.  I have place a docker-compose.yml file in each project responsible for starting up itself and any dependents. I then call docker-compose -f path/to/first/docker-compose.yml -f path/to/second/docker-compose.yml up.  This is fine but it requires that any relative paths in "second/docker-compose.yml" be relative to the first one 
[20:24:23] <iffraff> rather than relative to either the file it's self or to the dir the call is made from.
[20:25:30] <iffraff> This kind of stinks cuz there's times I'd like to call "second/docker-compose.yml" ala cart but I can't cuz the paths are all relative to the other docker-compose.yml file.  Is there anyway around this?
