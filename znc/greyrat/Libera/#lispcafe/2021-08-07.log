[01:09:05] * gilberth tries to get VM images for macOS 10.7 up until what ever is current which turns out to be tricky.
[01:10:50] <edgar-rft> maybe you could use whatever is voltage instead?
[01:11:05] <gilberth> To begin with for newer macOS versions I am send to iTunes, which doesn't work. Then I can't upgrade 10.7 to 10.12. It leaves me with a broken startup disk. Thank god^Wpasta monster this is all virtual.
[01:11:40] <gilberth> egdar-rft: I could combine both to gain power.
[01:13:53] <selwyn> thanks to lisp i have half a discord bot in 50 lines of code
[01:15:02] <gilberth> And I still miss 10.8, it's not available from Apple. But then 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15 are neither.
[01:16:26] <gilberth> My laptop is on 10.10 and I WILL NOT UPDATE.
[01:36:02] <lotuseater> it's a shame they force you by loosy arguments to update, like with Windows. or that programs can't run on an older version they used to sometime
[01:36:36] <lotuseater> "oh no, the old version is not secure you must update"
[01:39:41] <gilberth> Well, with Apple the reverse is true: Apple gives a sh** about whether any software still runs after an update. This is exactly the reason I want a host of macOS versions beyond 10.10 in a VM to see whether by CLIM there still behaves. And the reason, why I don't update at all. Why? Everything works, I miss nothing.
[01:40:29] <lotuseater> okay so forgive me :)
[01:40:54] <gilberth> However, they make it incredible hard to actually install an arbitrary version. And on a real machine there is no way to downgrade, but reinstall what ever was current at the time the machine was shiped.
[01:40:54] <lotuseater> of course, that's what I mean
[01:41:21] <lotuseater> hmpf
[01:41:42] <gilberth> And then there is no easy path to upgrade from that old version to anything but the current version.
[01:42:21] <gilberth> So you can choose between the version which was current as you bought the machine, or the current version.
[01:42:42] *** Joins: CrashTestDummy2 (~CrashTest@ool-ad02813b.dyn.optonline.net)
[01:43:00] <lotuseater> how long are you using Mac now?
[01:43:31] <gilberth> Since about ten years now.
[01:43:44] <lotuseater> okay
[01:44:06] <lotuseater> CCL is also in App Store I saw a while ago
[01:45:39] *** Quits: CrashTestDummy (~CrashTest@ool-ad02813b.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:46:10] <gilberth> Yes, they keep it there as a probe to verify that an CCL application could make it to the App Store as Apple demands either Swift or Objective C with its reference counting "garbage collection".
[01:47:19] <gilberth> Recently a DOS emulator was thrown out of the iPhone App store.
[01:49:01] <gilberth> What bothers me more is Apply now wants to scan data to be put into iCloud and when in doubt see it. So much for the iCloud being secure.
[01:49:49] <gilberth> It's getting worse and worse. It began with Jobs death. I fear the day I need to abandon Apple for the desktop.
[01:50:28] <lotuseater> like with so-called end-to-end-encryption at whatsapp
[01:50:41] <gilberth> I mean there will be a day at which you can't get software onto a Mac besides via the App Store as with an iPhone.
[01:50:43] <lotuseater> yes could be
[01:51:20] <lotuseater> oh don't forget, on the new MacOS you can run iOS apps. wooow
[01:51:28] <gilberth> Which means, you don't own the device anymore. I don't care about my phone, it's just a pretty expensive clock.
[01:51:51] <lotuseater> yes I also try to use it as such
[01:54:57] <gilberth> And besides a free software phone is illegal according to EU law.
[01:55:17] <Catie> Which law is that?
[01:59:18] <gilberth> I don't remember the name of that law, sorry. It's that manufacturers of handware, which uses radio communication like phones or wifi routers, must protect their devices against unauthorized software updates/changes.
[01:59:25] <lotuseater> wtf is the EU doing?
[01:59:44] <Catie> That seems... unenforceable. Among other things
[01:59:47] <lotuseater> oh yes, nasty hackers
[01:59:47] <gilberth> lotuseater: Aren't you reading the news?
[02:00:11] <lotuseater> no the most times I don't, to much garbage
[02:00:21] <gilberth> Catie: Since when do laws need to enforcable? Or reasonable?
[02:00:32] <gilberth> need to be.
[02:01:21] <Catie> No yeah, you make a solid point there
[02:01:22] <lotuseater> such politicians belong to be beaten up properly
[02:01:40] <gilberth> Upload filters for copyright infringement make my potential business idea and my HTML rendering of the clim-spec unfeasible or illegal, too.
[02:02:07] <gilberth> Oh, and sue me, there is no imprint on my web site.
[02:02:10] <lotuseater> illegal because forbidden by people who have no idea about anything
[02:02:19] <selwyn> i am sad at the return of the monoculture (if i can put it that way)
[02:02:40] <selwyn> olympic athletes get blocked on instagram for uploading copyrighted images of their own victories
[02:03:09] <lotuseater> I want to leave this planet.
[02:03:19] <gilberth> Well, nobody forced them to participate at that private event. A little bit different.
[02:04:56] <gilberth> My wife has fun currently. By law she must archive all sorts of documents for six to ten years, yet but other laws she has to delete some. There are certain contradictions there.
[02:05:15] <gilberth> * by
[02:06:04] <lotuseater> wtf
[02:06:33] <gilberth> For instance: I send an invoice => must be archived temper-free for ten years. I send an application for a job => Must be deleted within six month, without any means to restore it.
[02:07:24] <lotuseater> is this like with when I pay at a store with my girocard it's also stored somewhere for 6-10 years? this is also not correct, as it's very intransparent for myself. but suuure, SCHUFA can get anything
[02:08:04] <lotuseater> ah yes, so my recent AutoLISP application will be deleted in some months :D
[02:08:05] <gilberth> However, her liability as a CEO may it relevant that there were certain applications for jobs, she neglected or turned down => Ten years to archive again. Or six? I lost track.
[02:08:35] <lotuseater> ridicolous
[02:08:38] <gilberth> lotuseater: Sure, when you pay by girocard that must be archived for ten years by law.
[02:08:54] <lotuseater> yes but also just by law
[02:09:36] <gilberth> You get in real trouble when you mess with tax authorities, so you better obey it.
[02:10:11] <lotuseater> yes I don't want to, they hunt you down more as for murder
[02:10:21] <gilberth> Indeed.
[02:11:37] <gilberth> What bothers us more as a business is the case where we must delete documents. This kinda interferes with any meaningful automated backup.
[02:13:26] <Catie>  One would hope that encryption at rest would suffice. It would prevent unauthorized access while also not destroying the data
[02:13:29] <gilberth> Or put otherwise: Just archive everything, whether it's tax or liability relevant or not, would be cheap to implement.
[02:14:19] <gilberth> Catie: No one is authorized to look at an six-month old application. Nobody. It must be deleted permanently.
[02:14:58] <Catie> By the law yes, I meant as a less ridiculous alternative
[02:15:05] <lotuseater> what I wanted to point out about those saved procedures, who has copies of it? where is it stored? what are mechanisms build around that it wouldn't get corrupted? and such
[02:15:59] <gilberth> You timestamp and let it signed by a third party => temper-resistant.
[02:16:19] <lotuseater> sounds reasonable
[02:17:31] <gilberth> Not that much. But a CD-ROM or a stone tablet is not considered temper-free.
[02:17:59] <gilberth> It however implies costs, as you cannot do that by your own by definition.
[02:19:16] <gilberth> However, what most are not aware, the state has a right to look at your purchase history for the last ten years at a certain dealer. All it takes is the tax authority checking the books of that dealer.
[02:19:58] <gilberth> Without search warrant.
[02:25:11] <gilberth> Some of this applies to me in private too as by law, I am not a mere common customer but a business man (Vollkaufmann).
[02:36:09] <gilberth> Anyhow, this all is getting worse and worse. There will be time to build your own machines as long as soldering irons are not forbidden and abandon the internet.
[02:46:36] <selwyn> a friend of mine from school became a football hooligan
[02:46:53] <selwyn> one of his friends got on the s-bahn without paying a fare

[02:47:16] <selwyn> and six months later they sent a demand of payment letter to his house in england
[02:47:25] <selwyn> fuck knows how they managed to figure out who he was
[02:47:39] <gilberth> S-Bahn here in Germany?
[02:47:47] <selwyn> it was in german he couldn´t understand it that´s why he put it on facebook
[02:47:51] <selwyn> gilberth: it was an away game
[02:48:23] <gilberth> Aren't there Europe-wide databases about hooligans?
[02:50:29] <gilberth> And besides, when you're cought without a fare ticket, you are asks for your address and some document to identify yourself.
[02:50:37] <selwyn> he wasn´t caught at the time though
[02:51:07] <selwyn> they did some detective work themselves
[02:52:06] <gilberth> And how the hell did the Deutsche Bahn know he was riding without fare to begin with-
[02:52:16] <gilberth> ?
[02:52:21] <selwyn> well idk
[02:52:37] <selwyn> point i am making is that i am impressed by the determination of the s-bahn/deutsche bahn
[02:53:28] <gilberth> Yes, for what? EUR 2.50? (S-Bahn is local public transport).
[02:53:53] <lotuseater> selwyn: usually they're very incompetent

[13:07:28] <selwyn> i suppose not/

[13:10:27] <shka> not even AI
[13:10:31] <shka> just deep learning
[13:12:31] <hayley> The only supported interface is TensorFlow Lite, and I can't remember what operations that gives you. But there would be some kind of compiler and I could skim that for an idea of what features I get.

[14:21:09] <selwyn> hayley: you mean like just multiplying matrices or sth
[14:21:17] <hayley> Yeah.
[14:21:23] <selwyn> i think so
[14:21:31] <hayley> No derivatives, no backprop, just "run the damn multiplication".
[14:21:37] <selwyn> yes
[14:22:00] <selwyn> it isn´t a requirement to do backpropagation
[14:22:14] <selwyn> though i would add the disclaimer that i never actually used tensorflow for anything
[14:22:25] <selwyn> but i have read some examples of it
[14:23:42] <hayley> Dumb example: tensorflow.matmul(tensorflow.zeros([10,10]),tensorflow.zeros([10,5]))
[14:24:08] *** Quits: kakuhen (~kakuhen@user/kakuhen) (Quit: Leaving...)
[14:25:42] <hayley> tensorflow.zeroes([10,10], dtype=tensorflow.uint8) gives me integers, but bitwise ops seem to want booleans ):
[14:26:35] <hayley> Really, I am supposed to write tensorflow.bitwise.bitwise_and rather than, y'know, &
[14:29:58] <selwyn> hayley: it is more pythonic
[14:30:54] <hayley> Given that it is Python, I'd have a bad time doing any reduction or tests on the host.
[14:31:17] <selwyn> if you were using lisp it would be sth terribly verbose like ´logand´
[14:32:30] <hayley> But there is even a & to overload, which does bitwise and in Python. (The and keyword rather does logical/lazy and.) They chose to make it only work for booleans though.
[14:33:09] <selwyn> i see
[14:33:26] * hayley looks up "local rewriting compiler" to see what it entails, and it comes up with slides for beach's partial inlining. Very nice.
[14:33:34] <selwyn> i sometimes wish we had operator overloading in common lisp

[17:50:09] * hayley starts to think the Self JIT policy of waiting before doing a whole lot of JITing in one go was a precursor to the modern notion of minimum mutator usage.
[17:50:41] <hayley> The idea was that one shouldn't notice it stop for m milliseconds out of any n, and the policy would be tweaked so that there would be no noticeable "long pause".
[17:51:25] <lotuseater> selwyn: I don't know why but it produces negative outputs, so I wrapped the result in ABS. and I know, some stuff could be catched to not looked up twice
[17:52:18] <selwyn> hm
[17:53:19] <lotuseater> and when doing (optimize (speed 3) (space 1)) SBCL gives a warning about costs
[17:53:22] <hayley> Random thought, is the long signed or unsigned? And is the shift you do equivalent to (ash value -1)?
[17:53:30] <selwyn> yes that is what i am thinking
[17:53:55] <selwyn> right shift may be not semantically be what it is in the original c code
[17:54:05] <hayley> Can't see what it would change, but perhaps accidentally using signed stuff changes how your right shift works.
[17:54:07] <lotuseater> hayley: ha. you see, the ASH and LDB I'm not good aware of, so I did it as seen. :)
[17:54:59] <hayley> Okay. I'm not saying you can't use those, just to be careful about what happens with negatives.
[17:55:05] * selwyn flashbacks
[17:55:06] <lotuseater> of course, that could be the thing.
[17:55:31] <lotuseater> so ehy it produces the "right" value with negative sign
[17:55:35] <selwyn> i tried to implement bignums in clasp
[17:55:39] <selwyn> so many bitwise operations
[17:55:41] <hayley> Well, the original C uses a signed long. Now what does C >> do?
[17:56:28] <lotuseater> selwyn: oh CLASP hasn't those yet? would it make sense (as it's so near to LLVM and C++) to use GMP?
[17:56:31] <hayley> Woohoo, >> could zero extend or sign extend in C.
[17:56:33] <selwyn> clasp has those
[17:56:37] <selwyn> hayley: yes
[17:56:49] <selwyn> i volunteered to reimplement them to make them faster
[17:56:57] <lotuseater> hayley: is that now good or bad?
[17:57:06] <hayley> No one knows. So I guess we either assume the MSB is never set, or we pick an interpretation.
[17:57:27] <selwyn> which i did, but it broke the later build stages of clasp which i just couldn´t sort out
[17:57:41] <selwyn> so i left it and someone else did it better and properly :/
[17:57:58] <lotuseater> At least I dared to show you some now.
[17:58:14] <hayley> lotuseater: I'd have to check the IEEE-754 spec for what the MSB is.
[17:58:22] <selwyn> the moral of the story is that bit shifting is best done in a language where it is defined behaviour
[17:58:24] <hayley> Though aeth also wrote a CFFI inverse square root.
[17:58:50] <lotuseater> i could try if an unsigned-int fits better
[17:59:06] <selwyn> lotuseater: clasp does use the low level gmp interfaces to implement bignums now
[17:59:15] <selwyn> there is not much point in trying to compete with gmp
[17:59:24] <selwyn> afaik ecl still wins on the bignum benchmarks for that reason
[17:59:31] <lotuseater> ah cool. like Haskell
[17:59:53] <selwyn> yeah, haskell came up a lot when i was searching for information on gmp
[18:00:04] <lotuseater> heh.
[18:00:11] <selwyn> a relatively low number of language implementors use gmp
[18:00:13] <hayley> Oh, well, the MSB of a float is the sign bit, but as we do a 32->64 bit conversion...how does that work now?
[18:00:22] <lotuseater> and when one searches for C-- :D
[18:00:38] <lotuseater> so hayley what does MSB mean?
[18:00:58] <hayley> Most significant bit
[18:01:16] <lotuseater> okay
[18:01:43] <hayley> Now I am more confused. We do a 64 bit load on a 32 bit float apparently.
[18:01:56] <selwyn> clasp is now on llvm13
[18:02:08] <lotuseater> that wondered me also when I translated it
[18:02:17] <lotuseater> sounds good
[18:03:43] <hayley> Unless long means something else, which can happen.
[18:03:58] <lotuseater> yes
[18:04:29] <hayley> Oh, in Windows land a mere long is 32 bits, and long long is 64, right?
[18:05:01] <hayley> Here's a dumb idea, replace :long with :int.
[18:05:12] <lotuseater> i should learn finally how to use ash and ldb
[18:05:34] <lotuseater> I'm on Linux. or do you mean for when the code was written?
[18:05:46] <lotuseater> yes i thought on this replacement too
[18:07:09] <hayley> Well, AIUI the code was from Quake 3, which probably targeted Windows and its batshit C compiler, which again thinks long is 32 bits.
[18:07:43] <selwyn> lol
[18:08:32] <hayley> As I am legally insane, I look up Java implementations of things as they are more portable: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11513344/how-to-implement-the-fast-inverse-square-root-in-java#11513345
[18:08:33] -ixelp- floating point - How to implement the "fast inverse square root" in Java? - Stack Overflow
[18:09:06] <hayley> And they use int, which is guaranteed to be a 32 bit signed quantity.

[18:09:23] <lotuseater> batshit :D

[18:11:39] <shka> long is allowed to be 32 bits
[18:12:14] <lotuseater> and of course i forgot the (in-package #:cffi-play) to put in the paste

[18:15:22] <lotuseater> yeah so now the sign is +
[18:16:16] <lotuseater> hayley: could you explain what int32_t makes different?
[18:17:28] <lotuseater> so how would (bits->int (>> (mem-aref ptr-i :int) 1)) be with ash ?
[18:17:54] <lotuseater> ah okay like hayley said above, (ash n -1)
[18:18:19] <hayley> (ash (mem-aref ptr-i :int) 1)
[18:18:27] <hayley> Oops, -1
[18:18:41] <hayley> Positive values shift left, negative shift right.
[18:19:47] <lotuseater> hehe thx anyway :)
[18:23:34] <lotuseater> but this "i  = * ( long * ) &y;" can be confusing
[18:24:11] <lotuseater> but the &y is for referencing, right?
[18:25:25] <hayley> &y gets a pointer to y, (long*) magically turns it into a pointer to a long, and * deferences it.
[18:26:26] <lotuseater> oh my dialect, that's ... :D
[18:26:53] <hayley> A fun and totally illegal trick for memory mapped IO is something like char vga = (char)(0xB8000);

[23:49:41] <ln43> or it would be nice do a lice chat system for customer support
[23:50:02] <ln43> live ...
[23:50:11] <lotuseater> I'll look up the Wolfram Research article about it for you.

[23:53:56] <ln43> thankfully haiku continue to keep alive the spirit of beos ...
[23:56:45] <ln43> but was the temporal crystal really found by google or it's only another one funny story?
[23:58:03] <selwyn> the time crystal is legit
[23:58:22] <ln43> yes that one
[23:58:30] <ln43> is it a real fact ?
[23:58:32] <selwyn> (imo) 
[23:58:46] <selwyn> a time crystal is something that has been made in experiment before
[23:59:04] <ln43> ah ... nice
[23:59:17] <selwyn> but what is new about this, is the fact that they have used available quantum computer hardware to make such a thing
[23:59:33] <selwyn> whereas the previous attempts have involved designing your own experiment
[23:59:36] <selwyn> which requires effort
