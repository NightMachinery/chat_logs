[00:04:26] <mattf> good question 
[00:04:58] <mattf> by the wiki it seems like it will be automatic: https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate#LetsEncrypt
[00:05:31] <mattf> heip1ahd: Did the https webadmin interface worked for you?
[00:05:40] <mattf> im getting a invalid keyfile problem
[00:06:34] <Khaytsus> It's automatic.
[00:08:00] <heip1ahd> ok, cool :) i was just curious, currently i don't have any problems, certificate renewal is in a few months 
[00:12:05] <heip1ahd> mattf: yes webadmin worked without problems, can the user that runs znc read the keyfile?
[00:12:16] <mattf> yes it can
[00:12:28] <mattf> gee am i using the wrong file or what
[00:13:12] <mattf> heip1ahd: did you use privkey.pem from lets encrypt as your SSLKeyFile ?
[00:16:32] <heip1ahd> i'm using /etc/ssl/private/my.domain.key (i'm using acme-client on openbsd for letsencrypt certs, so the file location differs i guess)
[00:17:02] <mattf> ah ok

[00:46:40] <mattf> i think my keyfile is really bad!
[00:48:50] <heip1ahd> you can check it with: openssl rsa -check -noout -in privkey.pem

[01:16:01] <mattf> me too 
[01:19:18] <TitanOfOld> Huh. I'm using Let's Encrypt and I'm not having that issue.
[01:24:56] <TitanOfOld> mattf: What version of OpenSSL are you running?
[01:25:54] <KindOne> You made a /certs folder in / ?
[01:44:00] <Casper> mattf, are they key and cert files owned by the znc user?
[01:44:29] <mattf> yes Casper
[01:44:46] <mattf> I moved them to there to test this
[01:45:03] <mattf> they are not owned by the user but the user can read
[01:45:07] <mattf> should they be onwed...
[01:46:01] <Casper>  if( ! m_sKeyFile.empty() && access( m_sKeyFile.c_str(), R_OK ) != 0 ) <- Either your keyfile is empty, or the permissions are incorrect.
[01:46:30] <Casper> Can you do 'ls -Slah /certs/mattf' and pastebin the output?
[01:46:36] <mattf> look at my github issue
[01:46:59] <mattf> what permissions should they have?

[01:48:10] <Casper> At least 600 for your own user I assume, but if you could pastebin that command, just for verification, that would be nice. :p
[01:48:17] <Casper> Also yes, I've seen the github issue.
[01:48:26] <KindOne> its been updated

[02:00:09] <Casper> Should be a simple .Trim() I assume.
[02:00:09] <mattf> thats not possible i hope...
[02:00:50] <DarthGandalf> of course it's possible
[02:01:11] <mattf> it should be quoted in that

[13:03:08] <chalcedony> i'm trying to figure out where in znc it's storing channel joins that i don't want to join. It's either znc or hexchat and I've looked in almost everywhere. 'almost' because it's still doing it, even though it is not in 'autojoion channels' in hexchat, not in perform, and i've closed them in irc numerous times.  Is 'save' in the channels list of znc supposed to save that you deleted them?  
[13:05:27] <chalcedony> joining those channels is having a very undesirable effect:
[13:05:29] <chalcedony> [04:26:11] <*status> Disconnected from IRC. Reconnecting...

[13:14:14] <psychon> chalcedony: what does /znc listchans say about those channels after you leave?
[13:14:49] <psychon> if it is not in that list, then it's not znc's doing, I'd say (and znc does not auto-rejoin after a few seconds - that could be the chan-something-I-forgot-the-name module)
[13:15:29] <psychon> and yes, /znc saveconfig (or whatever it is called) or editing something in webadmin will make the channel disappear from ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf

[13:22:14] <chalcedony> it's reconnecting to them though.
[13:24:43] <psychon> immediately?
[13:25:27] <psychon> if so, do you have [[stickychan]] loaded?
[13:25:27] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/stickychan
[13:25:28] <chalcedony> when i flood off.. it reconnects and joins those channels
[13:25:39] <psychon> hm, that's not stickychan then
[13:25:51] <chalcedony> i don't believe i've ever used stickychan
[13:26:15] <psychon> next best idea would be to load [[raw]], wait for another reconnect and see if something like "YOU -> [JOIN #whatever]" shows up or not
[13:26:15] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/raw
[13:26:21] <psychon> if it shows up, then it's your irc client
[13:26:58] <psychon> hm... do you have more than one irc client connected to the same user/network? if so, it could also be one of those other clients (dunno if raw would pick that up)
[13:26:59] <chalcedony> hmm
[13:27:51] <chalcedony> they are channels i want to join on another network.
[13:29:45] <chalcedony> you did give me another idea though.. tried /znc saveconfig
[13:30:33] <chalcedony> i'm waiting to see if it disconnects again .. when it does i'll know.
