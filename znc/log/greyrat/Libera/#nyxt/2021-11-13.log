[15:43:31] <Jing> I am currently working on extending the spell checker. I have read the documentation, but just to be sure, the only way that Nyxt outputs messages to the user is by "message area"?
[15:45:46] <Jing> The prompt buffer seems to be mainly for getting user input, so it may be inappropriate to use it for printing multiple-line output (correction)

[16:44:49] <aartaka> Jing: yes, message area is the only place for messages so far.
[16:45:09] <aartaka> Jing: You can hack up some JS-based pop-up, though.
[16:45:36] <aartaka> Jing: Although I wouldn't do that, as it will be inconsistent with the rest on Nyxt.
[16:48:16] <aartaka> Jing: Regarding multiple corrections, you can actually use prompt buffer to allow user to choose between those.
[16:53:14] <Jing> aartaka, Thank you. Yes, it's my concern that using JS may not be consistent with Nyxt's style
[16:54:50] <aartaka> Jing: Using JS — not necessarily, we use Parenscript, after all. Using alternative interfaces that are not strictly necessary — yes.
[16:55:46] <Jing> I am trying to familiarize myself with APIs and what-not of prompt buffer-related things. I will try this suggestion

[18:00:25] <ecraven> is there a "hook" in webkit that allows me to look at *every* URL that is loaded (CSS, js, html, images, even XHR), and decide whether it is ok to load this or not?
[18:00:46] <ecraven> to implement various blockers. can this be done in nyxt?

[20:33:49] <aartaka> ecraven: Yes, the request-resource-hook is exactly what you want for blocking.
[20:36:12] <aartaka> ecraven: see manual for the example of usage. Returning `nil` from the handler cancels the request, altering the `url` of the `request-data` object passed into it "redirects" the request (although redirection only works for main page loading)
[21:45:23] <ecraven> aartaka: thanks!
[21:51:03] <ecraven> how do I add to that hook?
[21:56:14] <ecraven> for example, how would I add an anonymous function, that just prints the URL to stdout?
[21:56:28] <ecraven> hooks:add-hook looks promising, but I don't quite understand how that works
[21:59:35] <ecraven> ok, got that ;)
[21:59:59] <ecraven> are you sure this catches *all* resources? I've tried a few websites, and also looked at Firefox's Network tab, and it seems to miss a *lot* of URLs
[22:00:07] <ecraven> for example, no CSS file shows up at all
[22:01:32] <ecraven> for example, when going to www.lisp.org, I only see one URL, https://www.lisp.org, but firefox also shows /jmccolor.jpg and /favicon.ico
[22:02:16] <ecraven> this is what I added to my config: http://ix.io/3ETJ
