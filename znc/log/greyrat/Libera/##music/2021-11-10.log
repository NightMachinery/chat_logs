[20:38:02] <artao> eh?
[20:38:25] <artao> the movement of head to screen-space is non-linear
[20:38:35] <artao> move the head a little, the viewpoint moves a lot
[20:38:47] <louipc00D> like if i turnt my head 90 degree to the right then i cant see the screen anymore
[20:38:53] <artao> yeah
[20:38:57] <louipc00D> ohkay.. that would be trippy
[20:39:03] <artao> you just turn your head a little

[20:45:06] <artao> it can. i agree
[20:45:09] <louipc00D> and hard to hold that 
[20:45:18] <louipc00D> relaxing is hard to hold as well but easier
[20:45:39] <artao> ones with the two dots work better with cross eye, cuz then you "just" align the two dots such that they make a 3rd one between them

[22:02:41] <DOMF> coincides with the day I quit drinking
[22:02:44] <louipc00D> i thought the gunpowder day passed already
[22:02:58] <DOMF> that's literally what I just said ;)
[22:03:04] <louipc00D> yea
[22:03:16] <murthy> DOMF: :D who knows you could be the guy fakas reborn and plotting the next iteration :)
[22:03:17] <morlog> wasnt it 5 days ago
[22:03:29] <louipc00D> just make every day gunpowder day
[22:03:35] <murthy> Ya
[22:03:41] <murthy> I like that day
[22:03:59] <DOMF> I'm not a Catholic 
[22:04:05] <morlog> guy fawkes
[22:04:05] <DOMF> that was p much his big thing
[22:04:09] <murthy> Remember, remember, the 5th of November
[22:04:27] <murthy> Ya Guy Fawkes
[22:04:35] <murthy> And it's Panther
[22:04:36] <DOMF> Remember, Remember, that Alan Moore hates that that movie was made and a hero made of his character that was never supposed to be
[22:04:39] <murthy> I mean V
[22:04:44] <murthy> Panther is V
[22:05:15] <DOMF> Alan Moore is the SHIT. I'm reading Promethea rn for the first time and it's hella good
[22:05:20] <murthy> DOMF: will this YouTube api change break the supybot?
[22:05:39] <DOMF> so I saw you asked that, but I don't see anything in that link about an api change
[22:05:41] <DOMF> just a UI change
[22:05:56] <DOMF> so... nope?
[22:05:57] <murthy> No no
[22:06:02] <murthy> Wait
[22:06:19] <murthy> DOMF: you use YouTube api for your bot?
[22:06:22] <DOMF> yes
[22:06:32] <murthy> DOMF: did you check your mail?
[22:06:37] <DOMF> but the change you posted was not an api change
[22:06:40] <DOMF> oh
[22:06:41] <DOMF> uh
[22:06:42] <DOMF> no
[22:07:10] <murthy> Dear YouTube API developer,
[22:07:10] <murthy> ‌
[22:07:10] <murthy> We would like to inform you of upcoming changes to YouTube that will impact the data available via the Data API starting December 13, 2021.
[22:07:30] <murthy> I will paste the full notice now
[22:07:36] <louipc00D> yea i dont think they would change the api that drastically
[22:07:39] <DOMF> ok I just did, I don't have anything since july of 2000
[22:07:41] <DOMF> er 2020
[22:07:47] <louipc00D> plus janet doesnt post dislikes
[22:08:01] <louipc00D> so if janets properly implemented nothing should break
[22:08:33] <DOMF> she's not really but I still don't see how anything would break
[22:08:41] <DOMF> and am kinda curious why I didn't get that email
[22:08:43] <murthy> https://dpaste.com/4E8GAYYKH
[22:08:44] <Janet> ^ dpaste: 4E8GAYYKH
[22:08:59] <louipc00D> like if you're using a json library for api should be fine
[22:09:03] <morlog> s/ur/orn/
[22:09:03] <Janet> morlog thinks DOMF meant to say: and am kinda cornious why I didn't get that email
[22:09:04] <murthy> That's the content of the mail I got it
[22:09:07] <louipc00D> if u scraping the data, could cause breakage
[22:09:16] <morlog> s/orr/orn/
[22:09:17] <Janet> morlog meant to say: cold front coming through here either tonight or tomornow here i think

[22:09:56] <Janet> louipc00D thinks macrobat meant to say: evil corn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaX-xAhTIcY
[22:10:15] <DOMF> yeah we don't call that endpoint
[22:10:25] <DOMF> so, nothing will break. Thanks for the concern.
[22:10:28] <murthy> louipc00D: my concern is when you get data from your YouTube api by parsing the json
[22:10:43] <murthy> DOMF: ok
[22:10:49] <louipc00D> murthy: yea if u just scraping the data then could break
[22:10:53] <murthy> macrobat: hello
[22:11:07] <morlog> s/ould/orn/
[22:11:07] <Janet> morlog thinks louipc00D meant to say: murthy: yea if u just scraping the data then corn break
[22:11:08] <louipc00D> so just use a json library heuheueh
[22:11:26] <morlog> s/json/corn/
[22:11:27] <Janet> morlog thinks louipc00D meant to say: so just use a corn library heuheueh

[22:12:04] <Janet> louipc00D meant to say: murthy: yea if u just scraping the data then corn break
[22:12:13] <morlog> peepee poopoo caca doodoo
[22:12:26] <louipc00D> s/aca/orn/
[22:12:26] <Janet> louipc00D thinks morlog meant to say: peepee poopoo corn doodoo
[22:12:40] <murthy> It's just my fscked up programming
[22:12:55] <louipc00D> ur thing broke?
[22:13:19] <morlog> thats why we cant have nice things
[22:13:48] <louipc00D> s/an/orn/
[22:13:48] <Janet> louipc00D thinks morlog meant to say: thats why we cornt have nice things
[22:13:52] <murthy> I did it in a hurry. After parsing, I just use array to access the data and when one is gone, it might screw up the array. I need to take a look at the code again
[22:14:18] <louipc00D> ok switch to using a library
[22:14:50] <murthy> louipc00D: I am not sure but I think the title scrapper of idmusiq.com is working
[22:15:00] <murthy> I will check it later
[22:15:20] <louipc00D> kewl
[22:15:25] <murthy> louipc00D: oh I use the php library function
[22:15:39] <murthy> Not my own json parser
[22:15:42] <louipc00D> good
[22:15:51] <DOMF> we're just calling the videos api, not video.list
[22:16:09] <murthy> Ya
[22:16:23] <murthy> And the data returned is json
[22:16:32] <morlog> maybe you should stop calling them names and be nicer to them
[22:16:41] <murthy> DOMF: I get it now
[22:17:12] <murthy> morlog: hey I didn't call json..of a beach?
[22:17:31] *** Quits: Prints (~Prints@user/prints) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:17:42] <louipc00D> yea but the library should present the data in some kinda list object, or array
[22:17:47] <murthy> Oh I forgot Prints
