[00:08:40] <d_bot> <VPhantom> `ocamlformat` reads the project's `.ocamlformat` file so you can easily work on multiple projects with different configurations with the same compiler. I really don't see why you'd want to have one switch per project if you're using the same compiler version.
[00:09:36] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Each project's `*.opam` file specifies which OPAM packages it depends on, and I think nowadays that's even handled by Dune in the `dune-project` file but I haven't played with that yet.

[00:27:01] <d_bot> <Anurag> separate switches for projects can be useful if you need to use different version of the same dependencies in different projects.

[00:42:08] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Good point.
[00:42:50] <d_bot> <Anurag> I believe the OCaml compiler will gain relocation support in the future, so creating new switches with the same compiler version should become a lot cheaper in the future.
[00:43:16] <d_bot> <VPhantom> I wouldn't do it as a general practice though, because that's pretty darn heavy, compiling a new compiler and OPAM dependencies for each project, then keeping each one updated.
[00:43:24] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Oh good to hear.
[00:45:17] <d_bot> <Anurag> I've recently started using global switches combined with `opam switch link` so instead of 1 switch per project, I just create as many global switches as I need to satisfy my versioning needs, and then in individual projects i just link a global switch via `opam switch link <name> .` so get a similar workflow as a local switch, but i can have multiple projects share a common switch behind the scenes
[00:51:16] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Doesn't that get you shared dependencies though?
[00:58:12] <d_bot> <Anurag> It does, but in many cases I'm usually working with a core set of dependencies that I want to be replicated across some of my projects (usually async, development versions of some my own libraries, and these days the development version of cohttp, ) so that's worked out well for me so far!
[00:59:29] <d_bot> <Anurag> That said, these days i'm mosty working with dependencies that all build with dune, so I should try the opam monorepo plugin at some point ü§î

[04:33:05] <qwr> merlin supports emacs directly, wouldn't the LSP be just additional wrapper layer as it also uses merlin as backend
[05:06:28] <d_bot> <monk> to quote an earlier convo:

[05:06:29] <d_bot> <monk> https://discord.com/channels/436568060288172042/436568060288172044/883052899763118210
[05:06:59] <d_bot> <monk> > he main difference is that it's considerably faster completion and reuses flymake/flycheck rather than its own error display mechanism
[05:08:20] <d_bot> <monk> i haven't done any benchmarking but i will say that lsp (as in, the larger of the two emacs clients + ocaml-lsp-server) has been not noticeably slower and, if anything, very useful in terms of features like Lenses, inline type annotations, and playing well with ocamlformat
[05:09:23] <d_bot> <monk> fwiw my intuition was that merlin was good enough and unquestionably faster which is why i didn't bother trying until at least @rgrinberg suggested otherwise
[05:11:07] <d_bot> <monk> they suggested `eglot` as the client, however, which is generally considered less complicated and more efficient than `lsp-mode`
[05:14:26] <rgrinberg> there's an equal number of wrappers in lsp and merlin to communicate to the editor. the difference is either merlin's own emacs backend or eglot
[05:17:11] <rgrinberg> if you're using lspmode, you aren't going to observe any perf differences. as lspmode has its own perf pathologies
[05:21:00] <d_bot> <PureFunctor> I've flipflopped between eglot and lsp on Emacs and I've found no real differences to performance‚Äîwell, provided that I have a pretty lightweight config anyways
[05:23:21] <d_bot> <PureFunctor> Though most of my problems came from tracking an unstable version of either...
[05:27:49] <rgrinberg> maybe they fixed the problem in lspmode? i know they were somewhat aware of them
