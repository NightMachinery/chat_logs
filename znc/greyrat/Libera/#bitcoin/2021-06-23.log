[18:49:47] <earnestly> Hm
[18:49:53] <belcher> achieve what?
[18:50:19] <earnestly> Breaking the connection between A and B, if the 'another wallet' is C (and probably unique for each transaction)
[18:51:27] *** Quits: clf59 (~clf59@user/clf59) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[18:51:38] <belcher> if you make that transaction then any observer of the blockchain can see that coins went from the source to the destination
[18:52:05] <belcher> with coinswap it looks like the coins went to the destination, but they are owned by someone completely different, and the old owner now has coins in a different address totally unconnected
[18:52:12] <belcher> so coinswap breaks the transaction graph

[21:19:28] *** murderfascists was kicked by gribble (>_>)
[21:19:57] <AndyS2> Miguindi: movement in a page? If you are talking about Bitcoin transactions it's kind of common to have two outputs because the input is always spent in full, so the second output contains the change (remaining balance) of the prior output that was used in the input
[21:20:01] <glix> Miguindi: that's the change address, which you hold
[21:21:35] <AndyS2> if you had a single input and output, and the input was 1 btc and the output was 0.001 btc you'd implicitly pay a fee of 0.999 btc to the miner as the mining fee is all the btc in the input that are not being sent to outputs

[21:25:13] <Miguindi> Ok, I have send 0.005 TBTC, find with the hash the movement and in the imput is reflected those 0.005, and in the output is reflected one movement of 0.005 and another one of 0.04492265 TBTC
[21:26:53] <AndyS2> the input doesn't have a balance, it references an older, previously unspent output
[21:27:03] <AndyS2> that output probably has more than 0.005
[21:27:08] <AndyS2> or there's more than one input
[21:27:35] <AndyS2> everything else would be invalid, you can't spend more coins in a tx than you proof ownership of through an input
[21:27:59] <AndyS2> no idea what TBTC are, btw

[21:36:29] <AndyS2> because in that case, you actually owned some, no 'what if'. and made dumb decisions and lost/sold them.
