[01:39:20] <nckx> ‘Talk code, not politics’ is such a weird hot take.  We've all been in channels where folks are exchanging line numbers & function names in pursuit of a particularly nasty bug.  It's something everyone is glad is *over* when it ends, including those involved.  This notion that there's some silent majority of Tru Devlopers just yearning for a place to say ‘ha did you see line 221 that logior is pretty neat’ is… bizarre.
[01:39:52] <nckx> Of course these people aren't really interested in code; they just want to drone on about *their* politics unopposed like Guest39 here.
[01:40:28] <gustaf> yes

[20:58:48] <libsys> (here the GPL for reference: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone)
[21:00:29] *** Joins: critr (~critr@user/critr)
[21:02:58] <yrk> libsys: what are you trying to prevent?
[21:03:21] <libsys> business using free software as privative software within their companies
[21:03:51] <libsys> I mean, they still can make private use, but they can't prohibit their employees to distribute a copy
[21:05:16] <yrk> so, you are trying to stop this? http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#DevelopChangesUnderNDA
[21:05:58] <libsys> yes
[21:05:58] <yrk> libsys: because the GPL already doesn't allow _distributing_ under NDA
[21:07:29] <libsys> what i'm actually tring to do is say that this is distribution https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#InternalDistribution
[21:07:51] <yrk> libsys: you are trying to take away from any copyright holder the right not to distribute
[21:08:20] <libsys> they can not distribute, but they cannot prohibit it
[21:09:51] <yrk> I don't see the difference. the idea is that I would not be able to say to anyone I'm working on a GPLv3 project to hold off distributing the software until a certain date. not a big deal for me personally, because I either develop completely privately, or completely publicly
[21:10:29] <libsys> yes... indeed that would happen, but that's not what I'm looking for
[21:11:25] <libsys> I'm trying to stop companies using free software as if it were privative, by "not distributing" it (albeit they distribute it internally)
[21:11:32] <yrk> libsys: note that under section 7 of GPLv3, anyone would be able to simply strip away any additional restriction, so you'd have to make a new license that isn't the GPL: "All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ''further restrictions'' within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
[21:11:32] <yrk> restriction, you may remove that term."
[21:12:05] <libsys> yes, that's right... it would be other GPL, just like the AGPL
[21:13:25] <yrk> libsys: and therefore GPL-incompatible
[21:13:55] <libsys> no, it would include a gpl-compatibility clause
[21:13:57] <yrk> libsys: the only reason GPL and AGPL are narrowly compatible is because they mention each other explicitly in their respective section 13
[21:14:20] <yrk> libsys: that wouldn't fix it. since the GPL still wouldn't be compatible with it
[21:14:29] <yrk> libsys: compatibility has to go both ways
[21:14:29] <libsys> yup, but you can use a mit licensed software inside a gpl licensed software
[21:14:59] <yrk> libsys: that's because mit (expat) doesn't actually say anything at all. it is very easy to be in agreement with a mute person.
[21:15:24] <yrk> libsys: two _copyleft_ licenses of any kind of mutually incompatible by definition. both say "release derivatives under _me_"
[21:15:51] <yrk> libsys: that's why you'd need compatibility in both directions, like in section 13 of GPLv3 and AGPLv3
[21:16:04] <yrk> libsys: so GPL-compatibility would be one problem
[21:16:43] <yrk> libsys: this is why an explicit exception is required for GPL-incompatible licenses: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs
[21:17:09] <libsys> hmmm... yes, you're right 
[21:17:11] <yrk> libsys: the other problem I see is harming the right to private modification. I think that should be protected.
[21:17:28] <yrk> libsys: so I would suggest attacking the problem with a different mechanism
[21:17:32] <libsys> I don't, I don't force anyone to publish
[21:17:51] <libsys> I just don't allow to close

[21:18:12] <yrk> libsys: not having the right to keep something private is the same as being forced to publish it. being forced to live in a glass house is the same as having your privacy violated
[21:18:21] <libsys> think of it like letting stallman copy the printer driver outside of the university
[21:18:36] <libsys> you have the right to keep something private
[21:19:14] <yrk> libsys: I understand your motivation, and I commend it. However, I think that the solution you've provided is the "nuclear option" and destroys too much
[21:19:33] <yrk> libsys: it would give, for instance, a hosting provider the right to publish private git repos
[21:19:56] <yrk> libsys: if I have possession or access to your stuff, I can publish it without asking you
[21:20:34] <yrk> libsys: it would allow any employee of a non-profit to publish information from within that organization without their concent, as long as it is under that license.
[21:20:55] <libsys> no, data is not software
[21:21:06] <libsys> any code, yes

[21:21:43] <libsys> well, if you want to license it under that license, yes
[21:21:48] <libsys> that's the point

[21:23:18] <Guest39> what is code for?

[21:24:18] <Guest39> we may do well by reflecting that nearly each scientific advance is also used against us
[21:24:49] <yrk> libsys: so, if it is built to thwart private holding of code, and it is GPL-incompatible, who is this license for?
[21:24:54] <Guest39> atomic energy - bomb - js  fingerprinting - face recognition - totalitarianism
[21:25:24] <libsys> yrk: it's for real people, not legal people 
[21:25:36] <Guest39> to where do we run with endlessly more code more discoveries - perhaps it is life than runs via us however we express it in a weird way
[21:25:41] <yrk> libsys: what does that mean?

[21:27:06] <Guest39> libsys things are simply enforced or not
[21:27:18] <yrk> libsys: ah, so it is a derivative of the GPL which reflects that particular political point of view. nothing wrong with that.
[21:27:18] <libsys> IDK if you can see it, but companies actually use a lot of free software as if it were privative
[21:27:37] <Guest39> if law is broken and it can be enforced - it is real for people who felt it's effects
[21:27:52] <Guest39> if it fails to be enforced well
[21:28:00] <libsys> man, I legally can't use my own code a ton of times
[21:28:04] <libsys> it's ridiculous
[21:28:12] <Guest39> you can do all you do

[21:36:13] <yrk> libsys: how about this: start a push to have people ask for copyright-equity in their work similar to: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatIfSchool
[21:37:22] <yrk> libsys: all of the upsides with none of the downsides, and just about equally as hard to get a company to agree to as your proposed license
[21:38:31] <libsys> I think it's more or less the same
[21:38:47] <libsys> I don't see how that would prevent the "downsides" of my license
[21:39:09] <libsys> You are right though, I doubt old-school companies will want to use my license
[21:39:20] <libsys> I don't give a ** xD
[21:40:02] *** Joins: leah (~leah@libreboot/developer/leah)
[21:40:10] <yrk> libsys: well, I'm not any kind of company and I don't want to use your license. but I'm all for equal copyright-equity
[21:40:35] <libsys> companies don't use AGPL neither
[21:40:52] <yrk> libsys: actually, they do because it helps with commercial sales
[21:41:24] <libsys> by dual licensing you say?
[21:41:28] <libsys> or how?
[21:41:59] <yrk> libsys: lots of companies use it as leverage to get clients to buy custom licenses (http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions)
[21:42:18] *** Quits: Guest39 (~Guest39@217.153.187.164) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:42:28] <libsys> yeah, I'm not a proponent of that neither
[21:42:34] <jxself> "Oh you don't want to follow the AGPL? Just give us some money on the side and we'll say it's OK."
[21:42:35] <yrk> libsys: depending on how it is done, it isn't necessarily evil. it is done badly in some cases when the AGPLv3 version is intentionally crippled
[21:44:34] <yrk> unsurprisingly, for-profit corporations look at all of these licenses from the point of view of maximizing profit. so when you see someone using free software, it would be unwise to assume that they are doing it because they care about freedom in any way, shape, or form. though a completely cynical view of everyone is equally as bad
[21:45:21] <libsys> so, I think you understand why I'm creating this license, right?
[21:45:26] *** Joins: HawkinsTheWizard (~HawkinsTh@41.193.80.221)
[21:46:11] <libsys> it's just a mechanism of prevention of appropiation... it doesn't mean people can't make private use
[21:46:14] <libsys> even companies
[21:46:19] <yrk> libsys: yes, and I applaud the sentiment. I just disagree with the creation of Yet Another GPL-Incompatible Ethical License. it would just be added to the "GPL+no animal cruelty" pile
[21:46:37] <libsys> no, it's a free software license
[21:46:48] <yrk> (https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/20050211.html)
[21:47:14] <yrk> libsys: I don't think anyone claimed it isn't
[21:47:56] <yrk> libsys: and I disagree with the point about it not preventing private use, but I won't repeat my arguments.
[21:48:25] <libsys> it doesn't, it just doesn't enforce it within companies
[21:48:56] <libsys> it's making it "more free" instead of less, if you want to picture it like that
[21:49:10] <libsys> or, as an "stronger copyleft"

[21:51:27] <jxself> The "notwithstanding any other provision of this License" piece would probably not work, since the license is GPL-incomnpatible.
