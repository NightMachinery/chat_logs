[14:50:19] <paul424> cbreak, oki I just do ... a little more effort but always ..
[14:51:08] <cbreak> but if the function's actually inlined, it might not be easy to break on it, if your compiler doesn't add debug info for it
[14:51:28] <paul424> oki I just moved it to GameEntiy.cpp

[14:55:16] <paul424> only with -g

[16:27:06] <PJBoy> what about implicitly defined constructors?
[16:31:11] <cbreak> I name all my constructors the same as the class I define them in
[16:31:23] <cbreak> that makes my source code easy to read by both programmers and the compiler
[16:31:48] <cbreak> struct S { S() = default; }; // like this
[16:33:39] <comrad> onecould argue that less code to read is less code to understand
[16:34:31] <comrad> but true, excplicity is sometimes easier (one of the reasons i like the verbosity of java, its all there and defined and you dont have to know or guess)
[16:34:32] <cbreak> how would you reduce the amount of code for this?
[16:35:04] <cbreak> (remember: this is just an example of how to declare constructors in general, not for explicitly defaulted constructors)
[16:39:33] <ville> c++ could definetly benefit from giving shorthands for common patterns: non-copy+non-move, non-copy+move and copy+move types
[16:39:45] <comrad> i just define the constructor but without default
[16:40:29] <ville> (and there are no copy+non-move types so that does not need a shorthand)
[16:46:29] <ville> but that really doesn't fix anything fundamental about c++ it self
[16:48:05] <PJBoy> defaulted ctors are objectively better than empty body ctors
[16:49:46] <comrad> because clutter or why?
[16:52:49] <PJBoy> a ctor with a body is ineligible to be trivially constructible

[16:54:17] <ville> comrad: it changes the kind of type your type is
[16:54:40] <comrad> so if i write an empty default constructor the compiler has to anticipate that i do complicated stuff in there?
[16:55:10] <PJBoy> there are some ABI consequences
[16:55:20] <PJBoy> that i don't remember off the top of my head
[16:55:38] <PJBoy> I think Itanium prevents non trivial types from being in registers for example
