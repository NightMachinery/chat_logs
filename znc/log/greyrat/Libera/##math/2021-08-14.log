[02:17:25] <Z-module> laurus, take any t >= 0.  For g to be continuous at that t, it certainly suffices for g to be continuous on all of some domain X that contains t, and for this you don't even need X to be an interval. But here just pick N with N^2 > t, and now g is continuous on [0, N^2], with f^-1 = g  throughout there,  and t is inside that interval, so g is continuous at t.

[04:22:59] <laurus> I am confused about this proof: https://a.uguu.se/tvNzuATO.png . One thing I am confused about is this: If we have a family of open balls covering M_1, which are of the form B[a; r/2] for all a in M_1, how can, for points a_1, ..., a_n, B[a_1; r_1 / 2], ..., B[a_n ; r_n / 2] be a finite subcover, since the r's have now changed?

[04:25:57] <PlanckWalk> r isnt fixed.
[04:26:09] <PlanckWalk> "r > 0 (depending on a)"

[04:26:14] <int-e> oh
[04:26:19] <int-e> thanks

[04:26:39] <laurus> Oh, I see
[04:26:45] <laurus> So, I have another question about this:
[04:26:50] <int-e> (This happened... because I didn't read the part above (1))
[04:27:01] <PlanckWalk> Basically the sentence that ends in (1) is quantified under "for each a"
[04:27:13] <PlanckWalk> "there exists r" is inside that
[04:27:32] <PlanckWalk> The sloppy notation is carrying r outside that context
[04:27:43] <int-e> PlanckWalk: Yeah I object to using 'r' without quantifying it again (e.g.: "for all a in M_1 and corresponding r")
[04:27:50] <int-e> PlanckWalk: as you said, it's sloppy writing
[04:27:55] <laurus> Even if delta is the smallest of all these r_a's, how do we know that that delta works for the definition of continuity for a given a? The way we usually have it is that given _epsilon_, there exists a particular delta, but in this case it seems to be starting with the delta and assuming it works for continuity at a given a.

[04:29:55] <laurus> Oh, so it's saying that we start with one fixed epsilon, and that each of these a's we get an r_a that satisfies the definition of continuity at that a?
[04:29:55] <int-e> The minimum (delta) is one of the r_i, hence positive. (This is what goes wrong when you lack compactness)
[04:30:00] <PlanckWalk> There is an implicit use of axiom of choice in there

Of the supplementary chapters in Part B, the two chapters that stand out as worth looking at are perhaps Ch. 9 on extensions of first-order logic, and Ch. 13 (though not easy) on Lindstrom’s Theorems."

[13:46:43] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[13:46:49] <rubiksdream> kobalt the answer is A, the formula is of the form exists x_1,x_2,x_3 forall. x_4,x_5,x_6,x_7 phi(x_1,...,x_7), and phi(x_1,...,x_7) is an expression that we can take to be in DNF, where the literals are predicates or negations of predicates. There is a model with 7 elements, so for some elements a,b,c (possibly nondistinct), we know that forall x_4...x_7 phi(a,b,c,x_4,...,x_7) hold. Now take the substructure of this model with domain {a,b,c}
[13:47:14] <rubiksdream> this substructure has 3 or fewer elements

[14:47:58] <KatrinValerie> kinda logically follows

[15:45:28] <int-e> (And the computation is credited to N.J.A.S. of OEIS :) )
[15:45:34] <cherim> Doesn't look like the computations inspire awe in theorists
[15:45:42] <int-e> (The one up to 10^7)
[15:48:39] <int-e> cherim: anyway, I've added some text to the gist: https://gist.github.com/int-e/670e79925c9fe2fee191bea749b2b95d
[15:48:57] <cherim> I read the source, it's clear enough
[15:49:44] <cherim> I don't think changing the lines with ad-hoc 16/32 precision is a big deal
[15:49:56] <int-e> (It explains why I trust the C++ program's results despite some infelicities in the code)
[15:50:24] <cherim> You will hit the limitation of the two-modes approach soon enough with any precision handling
[15:50:36] <int-e> It has unbounded modes
[15:51:20] <cherim> Maybe I missed some parts then
[15:51:33] <int-e> (gooz can call itself recursively with increased precision)
[15:51:56] <cherim> I thought it either works with 64bits or with full gmp type
[15:52:10] <int-e> Ah, no, the gmp type also has bounded precision
[15:52:57] <cherim> Which source is current?
[15:53:27] <int-e> The gist has the current version that I'm running. (But none of the 3/5/7 code)
[15:54:27] <int-e> But the precision levels are 64/128/192/256/etc. under the assumption that we'll never need full precision at all.
[15:55:08] <cherim> Ok, and you think it gets stuck and not just drowns in many solutions?
[15:55:29] <int-e> The previous version got stuck.
[15:56:00] <cherim> By which mechanism?
[15:56:24] <int-e> by skipping ahead some, and losing all progress in the base conversions.
[15:57:34] <cherim> It's an implementation thing then, being too greedy with decreasing precision?

[15:58:44] <int-e> It seems better now anyway, thanks to a more precise check for making progress.
[15:59:46] <int-e> cherim: Sure, I didn't really explain where the code involves underapproximations, yesterday.
[16:00:59] <int-e> (Nor that they can undo progress made by skipping ahead.)

[16:03:10] <int-e> I haven't mentioned this in the text either... the base conversions use limited precision, so they truncate digits. And that usually makes the number smaller.
[16:03:38] <cherim> You also cascade 3->5->7->11
[16:03:54] <int-e> cascade?
[16:04:26] <cherim> It saves an iteration if several advances occur, but if some base doesn't advance, it's weaker than 3->5, 3->7, 3->11?
[16:05:02] <cherim> If the last advance was at 3
[16:05:18] <int-e> You mean, I could skip the intermediate conversions. Sure, but it would make the code more complicated.
[16:06:25] <cherim> You know whether you skipped digits in bred() in some base or not, don't need anything else I think
[16:06:29] <int-e> (Each conversion needs its own code somewhere, though I could pack it up as a template)
[16:06:54] <cherim> Can use last skipped every time
[16:07:00] <cherim> But this is all not very important
[16:07:18] <int-e> Yeah, it really isn't.
[16:07:53] <cherim> The scheme looks pretty optimal at this point, until next major getting stuck
[16:07:56] <int-e> I deliberately didn't dive deeply into error estimation.
[16:08:18] <int-e> Or error avoidance.

[20:54:31] <laurus> I'm trying to figure out a good reading order for this book (_Elements of Integration and Lebesgue Measure_ by Robert Bartle), table of contents here: https://a.uguu.se/xYzWfPoj.png . It seems like some courses recommend reading Chapters 1-3, then parts of Chapter 9 and parts of 11-17. But how do I know which parts of those chapters to do?

[23:08:09] <Kaylah> hello, I'm studying linear programming and came across this sentence: "The feasible region for any linear programming
[23:08:09] <Kaylah>  problem is a convex set. Moreover, if an LP has an optimal solution, there must be an extreme point of the feasible regionthat is optimal."
[23:08:59] <Kaylah> convex set means that the boundary lines are included in the feasible region, is that correct?
[23:10:02] <Panther> Not always
[23:10:33] *** Quits: dyeplexer (~dyeplexer@user/dyeplexer) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[23:11:06] <Panther> If one of the constraints is a strict inequality, then the boundary is not in the feasible region.
[23:11:25] <Kaylah> I was thinking so too
[23:11:59] <Kaylah> but if that first sentence is assumed correct, then that would imply that linear programming problems can never have strict inequalities as constraints, right?
