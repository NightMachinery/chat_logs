[00:21:06] <cousteau> doesn't look like a gcc flag; usually -m is followed by a word/abbreviation, and "odule" doesn't look like one
[00:21:09] <bionade24> cousteau: With this LDFLAG you can let libtool generate shared libs without the "lib" prefix. But I also got errors that some stuff would be linked twice.
[00:21:16] <cousteau> like -march (not -arch)
[00:22:35] <bionade24> cousteau: I guess it's one but maybe it's -m -o -d -u -l -e ? Highly doubt though that anyone would do that purposely write that in their Build system
[00:22:38] <cousteau> (btw, if searching with google, keep in mind that googling `-module` will EXCLUDE the word "module"; you'll need "-module" or simply "module" instead)
[00:22:49] <cousteau> bionade24: nah, gcc options don't work like that
[00:23:04] <cousteau> they're all long options with a single dash
[00:23:16] <cousteau> (...right?)
[00:23:53] <cousteau> for example, `-co` doesn't work, you need `-c -o`

[00:27:33] <bionade24> cousteau: Ok, good to know that. Wasn't sure. I also tried looked in man gcc but also other LDFLAGS like -avoid-version aren't explained in any other manpage either. Or I'm just too dumb to escape man -K correctly. *shrug*
[00:28:23] <bionade24> But man -K ' \-module' gives me a match for man X11.  Searching for ' \-module ' gives no match.

[00:30:54] <bionade24> cousteau: Although it gives a match, the Xorg manpage has to be wrong
[00:31:39] <bionade24> cousteau: Also it's -modulepath which is clearly wrong. Isn't there some list on the internet with all ldflags explained?

[00:32:38] <cousteau> anyway, ldflags are either stuff you pass to gcc directly, or to the linker via -Wl,
[00:33:00] <cousteau> it should be all in `man gcc`

[00:36:01] <twkm> in addition to being non-portable (which i grant is hard) it likely requires specific versions of the tools.
[00:36:31] <cousteau> well, neither of those options look like LDFLAGS in a gcc sense.  I suspect it's related to another program that just uses the name "LDFLAGS" in analogy with gcc in makefiles

[04:19:36] <mort> i.e not the most popular systems
[04:20:17] <cousteau> even MSVC supports C11 nowadays, I think
[04:20:30] <mort> only if C11 doesn't require %zu?
[04:20:37] <kurahaupo> mort: Si you're saying that the most popular systems are 22 years out of date?
[04:20:39] <cousteau> I think it does
[04:20:47] <mort> kurahaupo: yes
[04:20:55] <mort> Windows doesn't support %zu
[04:20:58] <cousteau> I know mingw has had trouble with it
[04:21:02] <kurahaupo> why not?
[04:21:03] <cousteau> huh, it doesn't?
[04:21:09] <kurahaupo> which compiler on windows?
[04:21:15] <nomagno> MSVC supports C11, not C99
[04:21:29] <mort> I think you can install different C libraries on windows through the visual studio runtime redistributables?
[04:21:35] <mort> but that the built-in libc doesn't support it
[04:21:36] <fizzie> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/format-specification-syntax-printf-and-wprintf-functions?view=msvc-170 says it supports z for size_t.
[04:21:38] <nomagno> C11 says VLAs are optional, while C99 says they are mandatory.
[04:21:41] <mort> at least that's according to what I can gather online
[04:22:57] <mort> I know I've had trouble with %zu on Windows
[04:23:03] <mort> it doesn't work with the default printf
[04:23:18] <kurahaupo> mort: Use a better compiler & libc
[04:23:31] <mort> kurahaupo: then get microsoft to ship a better compiler and libc
[04:23:34] <cousteau> mingw doesn't seem to support %zu.  I think this is a known issue.
[04:23:39] <mort> not as a separate redistributable
[04:23:47] <mort> cousteau: because it uses microsoft's libc
[04:23:48] <fizzie> The MSVC runtime used to not support it; pretty sure it now does, and the documentation (as linked above) agrees.
[04:24:20] <fizzie> Anyway, MinGW has also had a separate "ANSI stdio" workaround forever.
[04:24:21] <floatcomplex> and you can compile for it with clang anywhere msvc used to be required
[04:24:23] <mort> when did they add support to it in the default libc (i.e the one used by mingw)?
[04:24:30] <cousteau> so the problem is that my wine is out of date?

[04:25:26] <kurahaupo> Is MinGW a Microsoft product?
[04:25:33] <mort> no
[04:25:37] <fizzie> The version selection dropdown of that documentation page only goes back to Visual Studio 2015, but it lists z for size_t all the way back to that.
[04:25:39] <mort> but it uses the microsoft libc by default
[04:26:15] <fizzie> Even on the Visual Studio 2015 version of the page, it says: "-- we recommend the type-specific j, t, and z modifiers for portability."
[04:26:22] <kurahaupo> mort: how old is your libc?

[04:27:55] <mort> granted, that's on windows server 2016, maybe they added support for %z after 2016
[04:27:59] <fizzie> A random interweb search result -- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10278704 -- says "C99 printf including 'z' for size_t was fully implemented in VS 2015".

[04:28:44] <fizzie> I thought the common convention was to ship the runtime with your executables on Windows.

[04:45:07] <kurahaupo> cousteau: How about %ju?
[04:45:07] <rcf> If the syntax weren't horrid Powershell would be quite wonderful; so many headaches with shell scripts originate from the fact that the standard command line exposes so little of even the most basic POSIX APIs, or does so in a manner that's about as safe as gets(). 
[04:45:18] <cousteau> dunno, how about me?
[04:45:20] <cousteau> oh nvm
[04:45:21] <tdg> i just need my host system to support some proprietary stuff and not randomly break
[04:45:25] <tdg> if vms break that's fine, i can snapshot them
[04:45:27] <mort> kurahaupo: linux is much easier than windows, until it fucks itself and you're left with a broken system you either have to figure out how to recover (which you don't know how to do if you're a beginner) or have to reinstall (which loses all your data if you're not knowledgeable enough to know how to back up your files from the broken system first)

[04:53:01] <cousteau> nomagno: it's to protect the users!
[04:53:09] <mort> nobody cared, Canonical staff spent most of their energy arguing that it wasn't such a big deal because nvidia isn't widely used anyways, and 19.10 was shipped with that bug

[04:54:34] <mort> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/hirsute/+source/nextcloud-desktop/+bug/1923053 this bug, about "the nextcloud package segfaults on launch", was reported way, way before Ubuntu 21.04 was released

[04:54:58] <mort> 21.04 was still released with that crash bug because that was the most convenient considering timing and their package freeze
[04:55:23] <mort> so every nextcloud user was just left with a system which doesn't sync their files, silently
[04:55:36] <tdg> wonderful

[04:55:56] <nomagno> I still refuse to believe default point-and-click mouse-based GUIs are more friendly (for most tasks) for anyone that puts minimal effort into learning how to use their system
[04:56:01] <mort> my suggestion that arch is the best system is serious, by the way, though it comes with caveats
[04:56:50] <mort> I haven't used arch in years but it's maybe the system I've used with the least amount of issues caused by things which weren't user error
[04:56:50] <tdg> to me, the best system is one that i can use with complete default settings without any configuration and it won't brick itself over time because of an update. anything that does that, i can use
[04:57:23] <mort> and I'm much more tolerant to issues caused by user error (even if I might think the user error shouldn't have resulted in such severe issues) than issues caused by the system fucking itself up
[04:58:01] * oldlaptop has witnessed windows (I believe this was 7) brick itself with the first attempted update from a clean install, and therefore considers it disqualified by this criterion

[05:31:34] <nomagno> What the fuck
[05:31:55] <nomagno> The documentation has a license without a patent grant, and the code has a license with the patent grant
[05:31:59] <mort> well that's unfortunate
[05:32:02] <apotheon> Yeah, the spec license is shit, too.
[05:32:13] <nomagno> I would prefer the way around
[05:32:21] <apotheon> Show me a better-licensed implementation of WASM that is actually up to par.
[05:32:47] <mort> is the w3c license what HTML and stuff falls under too?
[05:33:08] <mort> if you're looking for a better-licensed *implementation* then surely v8 would count?
[05:33:18] <mort> that's BSD licensed apparently
[05:33:38] <apotheon> I don't recall V8 being a WASM implementation.
[05:34:02] <nomagno> apotheon: Your binary definition of shit license might be slightly off in this specific bookkeeping vs. badlyphrasedbookkeeping vs. nonbookkeeping scenario
[05:34:09] <mort> https://v8.dev/docs/wasm-compilation-pipeline this disagrees
[05:34:39] <mort> "V8 first compiles a WebAssembly module with its baseline compiler, Liftoff. Liftoff is a one-pass compiler, which means it iterates over the WebAssembly code once and emits machine code immediately for each WebAssembly instruction"
[05:34:46] <apotheon> Bookkeeping clauses make it potentially illegal to use common mechanisms for contribution to the project.  That's a shit license.
[05:35:02] <apotheon> mort: news to me
[05:35:15] <apotheon> It's good that exists, then.
[05:35:26] <mort> I think the entire world of patents is horrific
[05:35:32] <apotheon> It is.
[05:35:34] <mort> I don't understand how anyone can be confident in anything
[05:35:42] <apotheon> You can't.
[05:35:50] <nomagno> mort: patent grant or go home
[05:35:53] <apotheon> It's a giant clusterfuck of chilling effects.
[05:36:01] <nomagno> That's my philosophy for implementations
[05:36:12] <mort> I could probably write a hello world program and it infringes on some "greeting planetary bodies using electronic means on a computer to an emulated type writer" patent
[05:36:15] <nomagno> Fortunately, C99's potential patents would have expired!
[05:36:18] <nomagno> Which is why I use it
[05:36:19] <apotheon> The problem is that the patent grant doesn't protect you from potential patent claims by any of the other seven billion people on the planet.
[05:36:49] <nomagno> apotheon: aren't actual patent registries useful for something?
[05:36:51] <apotheon> It protects you from one.
[05:37:17] <apotheon> nomagno: Define "patent registries" in this context.  Do you mean the USPTO, for instance?
[05:37:22] <mort> anyways, I'll let google worry about patents and let myself not think about them until I'm sued for patent infringements
[05:37:50] <apotheon> mort: Yeah, you pretty much have to just cross your fingers and have a plan for declaring bankruptcy without losing everything.
[05:37:59] <nomagno> apotheon: I have no idea of patent law outside the US, I live in Europe, and I don't have a lot of idea about patent law in the US
[05:38:02] <nomagno> So go figure
[05:38:18] <nomagno> probably, I know there's a registry
[05:38:43] <mort> my understanding is that 1) intellectual property in the US is draconian, and 2) the US exports that to the rest of the world through trade agreements which non-US countries can't afford to not sign
[05:38:52] <mort> I just assume everything and everyone is fucked
[05:38:59] <apotheon> nomagno: Something could be under patent in the US and in Germany, "owned" by two different entities, so that they effectively cannot operate in each other's back yards without paying licensing fees.
[05:39:29] <apotheon> mort: That's a pretty good summary of the situation.
[05:39:40] <nomagno> apotheon: ah yes, the classic Tetris-style IP scramble
[05:39:49] <apotheon> . . . and the *stupidest* shit gets patented, because no patent office can keep up.
[05:39:59] <nomagno> And Intel/AMD joint duopoly scramble

[05:41:29] <mort> that's such a weird argument
[05:41:41] <mort> if you have a patent, and apple infringes on your patent, what're you gonna do? Sue Apple?
[05:42:03] <apotheon> "License this to our company for pennies, or we'll sue you for thirty-seven patent infringements.  Oh, yeah, all thirty-seven of these patents we own are bullshit that could get overturned by a competent attorney, but we'll still destroy you just with the litigation process."
[05:42:04] <mort> as if they can't just throw a few billion dollars at lawyers to drag out the fight until you're dead

[05:43:10] <mort> trademarks are the most sensible form of IP, they're essentially a consumer protection thing

[05:43:26] * vdamewood sues apotheon for infringing on his patent on the letter e.
[05:43:40] <mort> copyrights make sense in principle but "life of the author + 70 years" is wild and there should be much more room for building on top of things invented by others
[05:43:40] <apotheon> Trademarks seem great in principle, but in practice they're shitty too.
[05:43:50] <apotheon> . . . and really they should be replaced by saner fraud law.
[05:43:57] <mort> fair
[05:44:01] <nomagno> I patented the letter a before the Greeks even drew it up on their funny one-page books, you fools!
[05:44:17] <apotheon> perhaps the most sensible form of "IP" law, but still not very sensible, in other words
[05:44:32] <mort> funny thing is, you don't need to be the first to do something to patent something, shit with prior arts gets patented all the time
[05:44:48] <apotheon> It's like having a law against murder, and adding another law against murdering someone on Sunday.
[05:45:04] <apotheon> You don't need trademark law -- just better policies for fraud law.
[05:45:16] <nomagno> I don't think there was anyone arguing IP was in the interest of the people when the first UK/US legislation was passed
[05:45:42] <nomagno> The economic-social tradeoff was perfectly understood, but then the message was lost over centuries
[05:45:54] <mort> I think there are some things where it makes sense to treat trademarks specially though, where I wouldn't be comfortable calling something fraud but would be comfortable making it illegal based on trademarks

[05:46:41] <mort> e.g if firefox doesn't want their brand name to be used in cases where major features are missing or broken because someone patched firefox, built it using the patched source, and released it as "Firefox"
[05:47:17] <apotheon> nomagno: The incentive is not for innovation, but rather for shifting innovation from whatever offers the best benefits without patents to what offers the best benefits *with* patents.

[05:48:16] <mort> maybe a better example would be, I think it's fair for something like the Pale Moon project to not be allowed to brand their project as "Firefox" because the intention is explicitly to have a wildly different experience from what Mozilla wants Firefox to be
[05:48:27] <apotheon> mort: If they try to pass it off as upstream, that's a falsehood.  If they don't, that's obviously on them, not on Mozilla.
[05:48:37] *** Quits: travankor (travankor@user/travankor) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:49:10] <apotheon> Pale Moon is obviously a different thing, and pretending it isn't would be fraudulent, under sane law.
[05:49:42] <mort> what if nobody actively tries to pretend it's upstream, but it keeps the firefox branding
[05:49:52] <apotheon> They could, however, call it "RetroFirefox" if not for trademark law and make it *very* obvious it's not the same project.  With trademark law, they can't.
[05:50:04] <mort> a user who ends up interacting with pale moon would end up with the incorrect impression of firefox, and I'm not sure I'd be comfortable calling that "fraud"
[05:50:11] <apotheon> Now, you say "Pale Moon" and nobody knows what the fuck you mean.
[05:50:23] <nomagno> Because the phrasing of law, society and propaganda is backwards with what using analogies to property and rights, this whole discussion would have to be summarized as "we believe taking this fundamental right from people would give them a fundamental right back".
[05:50:35] <nomagno> Thank you, lost terminology war
[05:50:56] <apotheon> yep
[05:52:23] <apotheon> Hell, Firefox ended up named Firefox because both Phoenix and Firebird were already used as names for other software, even though the types of software were so distinct that nobody was going to mistake the browser's name for an implementation of the other software.
[05:52:37] <nomagno> IP enters in direct conflict with that often taked about definition of freedom as "the capability of oneself to act as they wish, that ends with any other person's freedom"

[06:03:41] <mort> I know 100% that deep power imbalances can and will happen in many (maybe all?) systems
[06:03:41] <wroathe> I just think it comes down to the fact that it's impossible for humans to actually administer impartial justice

[11:37:48] <dave0> the only references i can find to non-all-bits-zero null is before 1970 .. but i have a vague memory of a powerpc with a special trap value for pointers which is not all-bits-zero but could theoretically be used for null, to help debugging BUT i also read that even though you /could/ have a non-all-bits-zero null, it broke so much code that never put it in the compiler

[19:07:30] <ioxzev1z> Also "this is a single thread program" means that when it eventually needs concurrency you have to go fix that function
[19:07:55] <ioxzev1z> I don't see that being slow enough to care even if it's run millions of times
[19:08:13] <ioxzev1z> Also shouldn't inline be before the return type
[19:08:44] <uskerine> I will move it before the return type
[19:08:51] <uskerine> shall inline be used both at the definition and declaration?
[19:09:11] <ioxzev1z> inline is just a hint for the compiler, which it can ignore
[19:09:36] <ioxzev1z> ,inline
[19:09:36] <uskerine> and yes it is slow and I need it to execute faster, and no it will not need concurrency in the future
[19:09:37] <candide> A function declared with an i​nline function specifier is an i​nline function. Making a function an i​nline function suggests that calls to the function be as fast as possible. If you use `i​nline', always use `static', too. See https://kellett.im/a/inline
[19:10:12] <uskerine> so the usage of static is consistent with the usage of inline
[19:10:27] <cousteau> uskerine: don't use inline without static, as the factoid suggests
[19:10:32] <ioxzev1z> That means static inline, not static on the variable inside
[19:10:33] <uskerine> ok
[19:10:46] <uskerine> static for the whole function?
[19:10:49] <cousteau> `inline` without `static` has a rather obscure meaning that is most often not what you want
[19:11:26] <cousteau> `static` at file scope means "don't give this external linkage", so the compiler can optimize it and choose to inline it if it feels like it
[19:11:41] <uskerine> I see
[19:12:00] <uskerine> shall `static inline` be used in the declaration, in the definition or in both?
[19:12:11] <cousteau> in fact, if your compiler is good enough, you may not even need the `inline` at all.  That keyword is just a hint to the compiler.
[19:13:13] <cousteau> so you'd have `static inline unsigned int date_to_epoch(...) {...}`
[19:13:27] <uskerine> Got it
[19:13:36] <cousteau> (why unsigned, btw?  I know you're probably not a time traveler, but it may be useful to represent dates before the epoch)

[19:14:30] <cousteau> re: using it in the declaration, definition, or both, I'm not sure but I'd go for both just for the sake of consistency.  (I rarely have separate declarations anyway.)
[19:14:46] <ioxzev1z> uskerine, you can't inline variables, and as I said above you don't need static on that
[19:14:46] *** Joins: john99 (~john99@199.246.103.34.bc.googleusercontent.com)

[19:15:19] <uskerine> sorry I meant the declaration of the function
[19:15:37] <uskerine> but also I am wondering about the variable struct tm t, if that shall be static or not
[19:16:04] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[19:16:05] <cousteau> no reason to
[19:16:31] <uskerine> so the usage of static inline (if honoured by the compiler) will already make struct tm t static 
[19:16:32] <uskerine> ?
[19:16:44] <cousteau> no, and there's no reason it should
[19:16:55] <ioxzev1z> wat
[19:16:58] <uskerine> isn't it more efficient as it does not require to be allocated? (just asking)
[19:17:08] <cousteau> a file-scope function or variable being marked as `static` has nothing to do with static variables; they just reused a keyword in a confusing way
[19:17:14] <ioxzev1z> uskerine, are you writing this code for an 8086?
[19:17:33] <cousteau> also it won't be allocated, it will be placed in automatic storage
[19:18:24] <cousteau> and probably addressed directly, using a small offset from the stack pointer (NB: this is an implementation detail)
[19:19:51] <cousteau> (allocated = "in the heap"; automatic = "in the stack"; at least that's what implementations typically use.  Note that there's no "stack" nor "heap" in C; only in some implementations of C but it's not a C concept per se.)
[19:19:55] <uskerine> regarding your question on why unsigned int, it is used there as all the epochs handled begin at 2000 so it will avoid Y2038 problem (if this code is still running in 2038)
[19:20:57] <cousteau> ok... but I'm not sure that'll be enough to overcome that issue.  There might be issues related to integer overflow internally that cause undefined behavior, even if you convert the result to unsigned afterwards.
[19:21:09] <uskerine> so cousteau your view is that it will likely be stored in the stack (automatica storage) and that is fast and has no performance penalty. what would happen if I would mark the variable as static (it retains its value from one execution to another, where it would be allocated?)
[19:21:25] <cousteau> also, Y2038 shouldn't be an issue in modern, 64-bit computers
[19:22:01] <mort> *shouldn't*, but will be
[19:22:13] <mort> how many programs cast a time_t to an int do you think
[19:22:17] <uskerine> I am storing the epochs in files too (in binay), so if I stick to 32 bits unsigned I save space
[19:22:26] <cousteau> no, not likely; it WILL go to the stack.  Or if the compiler is smart enough, it may not even make it into the stack, and be left in the processor's registers.
[19:22:55] <uskerine> understood
[19:23:02] <cousteau> mort: absolutely none because bugs that only surface when it's too late to fix them don't exist :)

[19:27:17] <cousteau> long story short, after the third or fourth consecutive Wednesday of a tool failing mysteriously no matter what, and the next day fixing itself without doing anything, the guy working with the tool started investigating and eventually figured out that the problem happened when the tool printed the system date on an output file as a comment
[19:27:39] <cousteau> and the Spanish (system language) word for "Wednesday" is "miércoles"

[19:53:21] <cousteau> ioxzev1z: that statement is more true of C than, say, Python
[19:53:38] <cousteau> let's say that the abstract machine is thinner, and maps more directly to the physical machine
[19:54:01] <cousteau> re: LCTHW, there's the factoid ,{lcthw}
[19:54:01] <candide> Learn C The Hard Way is an online book that should be avoided. It does not teach you C, but rather shows how C might work on a specific implementation. It contains numerous errors, bad examples and absurd arguments. See http://hentenaar.com/dont-learn-c-the-wrong-way and https://kellett.im/a/hardway
[19:54:35] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[19:55:27] <cousteau> but yeah, people think C is less abstract than it actually is.  (And they may be partially right, at least with -O0)
[19:55:32] <ioxzev1z> cousteau, my problem with that quite was "C is different because it's using the real CPU's actual machinery to do its work". It makes the implication that C is some special language that can use parts of the CPU that others can't. "using the cpu" isn't specific to C at all

[19:56:00] <cousteau> well, the way it's phrased it may sound like that
[19:56:30] <cousteau> although I think they meant "directly"

[19:56:53] <uskerine> btw, I see no difference between using static inline and not using it, in both cases execution time is around 40 seconds
[19:56:55] <cousteau> (which isn't strictly true either, but well, it's more correct for C than for other languages, as I said)
[19:57:25] <ioxzev1z> uskerine, as said before, you didn't need static inline for that
[19:57:30] <pony> just give other langs a utilise_cpu() function
[19:57:42] <cousteau> of course, what I think they meant, what they think they meant, and what they actually meant are probably 3 entirely different things

[21:17:25] <cousteau> and following paragraphs
[21:18:01] <nomagno> ioxzev1z: Languages like perl don't necessarily run on a virtual machine. The compiled language (C) is used to program an interpreter that parses the source code, is converted to pseudo-instructions, and the pseudo-instructions are executed from a predefined list inside the C code
[21:18:57] <nomagno> So basically perl still interacts with the CPU directly, and can access memory and all other shared resources. It just needs a real-time (and sometimes dynamic) translator between source code and CPU to work
