[08:03:08] <PattyCakes> ok

[08:03:17] <yuken> And that's perfectly safe in the United States.

[08:04:16] <yuken> whereas homemade ones don't seem as good.
[08:04:23] <yuken> ... plus all the extra butter, salt, and acid, and sugar.
[08:04:38] <yuken> But proper cooking also adds on to it - and proper cooking in this instance is actually a lower temperature.

[08:09:08] <misspwn> thing is, i prep before and clean as i go. when it's all timed out most meals don't take more than 30 minutes unless it's in the oven already. so it's not "time" it's the mental energy

[08:10:10] <misspwn> cooking for me is probably like some person who really loves programming
[08:10:30] <misspwn> you have a flow, you enjoy it and can think on the fly if necessary
[08:10:38] <yuken> misspwn, get a meat thermometer if you don't have one, right. And get a whole chicken - but, you have to make sure this whole chicken is smaller than average US chickens; you don't want one of those artificially big ones, they aren't good for this.
[08:11:05] *** Joins: jay-ros (~jay-ros@user/jay-ros)
[08:11:14] <misspwn> i have a few large dutch ovens for what ever you are gona throw at me and a meat thermometer probe
[08:11:22] <yuken> Good, good.
[08:11:25] <yuken> I'm typing it out.
[08:12:30] <yuken> Spatchcock the bird. Make sure the thighs touch the pan. The secret to this is - you want these thighs to be ripping hot, while the breasts are cooked much more gently. So, you put it on a burner, low heat, tuck the legs in and get the thighs to touch your dutch oven. You want the skin to render out fat - this is going to be your cooking fat, and also crisps up your skin.
[08:13:27] <yuken> You basically want to partially cook your thighs before your bird goes into a preheated oven at 425F. Then, just shove it in your oven once the thighs are browned - but make sure you untuck the legs, so the browned bits aren't touching the pan anymore, so they don't burn. You don't want them _TOO_ browned either, just mildly; use your judgement.
[08:14:07] <yuken> Cook until your thighs register 200F+, and your breasts register 145F+, ideally. Pull when your breasts read 150F+, which should be about 5-6 minutes, then let rest.
[08:15:03] <yuken> misspwn, this is because dark meat gets amazingly tender and fall apart at these high temperatures, whereas white meat has less fat and loses all its moisture. 150F+ after 5-6 at 145F is safe to pull chicken, because salmonella death is a function of time & temperature.
[08:15:14] <yuken> Once you pull it and let it rest at 150F, everything in there is dead.
[08:17:03] <yuken> misspwn, oh, additionally - salt the chicken 24 hours before cooking it. This dries out the meat - in a good way. You don't want water; salt draws water to the exterior, which then evaporates. This also lets the salt disperse into the meat evenly, making every bite juicier, since salt engages saliva glands.
[08:17:09] <yuken> Salt == saliva == "juicey" meat.
[08:17:42] <yuken> Less water also makes it brown better :). also fuck, I'm sorry for this wall of text
[08:17:49] <misspwn> this sounds like a sunda dinner
[08:18:14] <misspwn> but uh, ima have to pass the kitchen scissors to my other half to cut the chicken
[08:18:26] <misspwn> you say salt but are you talking like a brine?
[08:18:56] <yuken> misspwn, it's called "dry brining". See, the salt will naturally disperse throughout the meat, through... osmosis? is the word I think, I forget high school biology.
[08:18:59] <yuken> because I literally slept through it.
[08:19:30] <yuken> this draws water out towards the surface, which is wicked away into the air, drying the meat of water. This si good - water is the enemy of browning. Browning == tasty meat, crispy skin.
[08:19:54] <misspwn> have seen them pack fish with salt on the outside to fully enclose it so is it like that or just patting dry and seasoning with salt and letting it sit in the fridge
[08:20:06] <yuken> That's one of the reasons why steaks made at a good steakhouse have such amazing crusts, misspwn - they're dry brined, and super duper high temps.
[08:20:12] <yuken> Most people at home just do a pat down, if that.
[08:20:41] <yuken> Oh no misspwn - dry brine is basically, the amount of salt you'd normally use... except you just let it sit for a day beforehand, in the open air, refrigerated.
[08:21:05] <yuken> Refrigeration is optional, really. But do it for food safety reasons, since you probably have access to one lol

[08:21:54] <misspwn> that would be a tough one with small hands going in the fridge unless i prepped it right before bed
[08:22:19] <yuken> misspwn, 24 hours is the ideal time, but just a few hours works.
[08:22:47] <yuken> You just want the salt to completely dissolve. See, when you put the salt on the meat, you need to cook it immediately, or wait. This is because after a minute or two, the water will be drawn to the surface - ruining any chance of good browning.
[08:23:14] <yuken> But if you wait long enough, that water will stop being drawn to the surface, and dry off. The issue here with cooking after salting, and waiting but not long enough is - you can't wipe the water off, without wiping your salt off!
[08:23:17] <misspwn> zucchini and cauliflower kinda do the same when i rice it
[08:23:26] <yuken> And then if you do that, you can't really judge how much salt you need now misspwn, because you don't know how much was absorbed.
[08:23:33] <misspwn> yeah
[08:23:46] <yuken> So salt and cook imediately, or salt and wait at least a few hours. The latter is almost always a better result, but requires advance prep.
[08:23:59] <yuken> But it's so worth it if you can prep.
[08:24:10] <A-KO> waddup?

[08:25:35] <misspwn> thicccc
[08:25:36] <yuken> you'd use less for thinner pieces, because there's less meat to dissolve into by... volume... or however it'd be said.
[08:25:59] <yuken> even if you just salt the one layer, it will eventually go throughout the entire steak, too! Just slower than salting both :P

[08:31:58] <misspwn> yeahhhhhh
[08:32:34] <Kiernian|Work> doing that without the oven part is called "pittsburgh blue" isn't it?
[08:32:42] <yuken> misspwn, and even better - if you don't normally like rare steaks, this method might change that. One of the reasons rare steaks come out worse than medium-well for certain cuts is fat content that doesn't melt when cooked rare at high temps - it doesn't help time to melt.
[08:32:54] <yuken> But if you cook it slow and steady for an hour, to get up to temp - all that fat is already kinda melted!
[08:33:15] <yuken> Kiernian|Work, yeah. It's to get a super good crust on the meat, without cooking the inside anymore. You've already cooked the inside in the oven to your perfect doneness, and just want the brown crust.

[08:39:32] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> well, okay, i guess aircon comes on every so often
[08:39:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but that's often off to save energy too
[08:39:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> heat uses up the heating oil lol
[08:39:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> we also have an oh-shit kerosene indoor heater too
[08:40:09] <Croran> yuken: my stove is gas powered. should i bring it out to the driveway? lol
[08:40:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> its really common
[08:40:17] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> oven too lol
[08:40:30] <yuken> @Hunterkll Bullshit, that you can just run a propane stove indoors, in an area that isn't specifically ventilated for it.
[08:40:33] <yuken> like ventilation above a gas stove.
[08:40:35] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> also a few camp propane heaters and a grill size propane tank for them
[08:40:39] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> erm
[08:40:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> we don't have an exhaust hood above our stove
[08:40:44] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> noone does
[08:40:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> thats for richer people
[08:40:51] <yuken> ??? have I been wrong this entire time
[08:40:52] <yuken> holy shut
[08:41:04] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> when i smoke out the kitchen with something i'm cooking because i burn it i have to open windows and turn on fans
[08:41:17] <yuken> same
[08:41:36] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> because of lack of any signigant ventilation other than normal leakage and/or aircon
[08:41:37] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[08:41:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> no exhaust hood, none of that shit

[08:42:00] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Oh shit
[08:42:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and drink it slowly

[08:42:32] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the human body can only absorb so much water per time period, so drink a little bit, every 15 minutes or so, maybe a quarter glass or something
[08:42:38] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the rest just bypasses most of your system and you piss it out
[08:42:50] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> jesus that is better immediately @Hunterkll

[08:43:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> add a pinch or two of salt to your glasses of water
[08:43:34] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> might not taste the best, but will help, and drink slowish like i said
[08:43:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i mean, drink faster if you want, but it won't make a difference, it'll just give you temporaryt feel good periods while it's all cycled right back out
[08:44:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> salt aids in water retention as well
[08:44:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but not too much, or you'll get water-fat
[08:44:27] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's why modifying (up or down) sodium intake can really fluctuate your weight noticably
[08:45:14] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> I like saltwater tbh.
[08:45:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> some do, some don't
[08:45:52] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but you also don't want it to be ocean saline levels either
[08:45:54] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> because that'll dehydrate you

[09:03:08] <yuken> SirSceptalot, good, good. I made a big boy raifu. My old one was about... 75cm?, and this one is 112cm.
[09:03:11] <yuken> I can barely hold this one.
[09:03:32] <SirSceptalot> that's what she said
[09:03:50] <CableNinja> s/raifu/waifu/
[09:03:55] <CableNinja> we all know thats what he really meant

[09:04:49] <Seto_Kaiba> don't you know this?
[09:04:51] *** Seto_Kaiba is now known as Hunterkll
[09:04:56] <Hunterkll> it makes the virigin neckbeard feel better
[09:05:05] <CableNinja> doesnt matter, we all know he meant he made a big boy waifu pillow
[09:05:15] <CableNinja> so he can dry hump it to sleep every night
[09:05:25] <Hunterkll> huh, i think i have that heatguard
[09:05:34] <SirSceptalot> Hunterkll, I'm not sure if I should ask you why you know what that is, or doubt if it's really what you say it is
[09:05:35] <Hunterkll> also lol @ sissyboy takedown pins 
[09:05:46] <SirSceptalot> I know what thing for sure: it's something that isn't going in my google search history
[09:05:48] <yuken> Hunterkll, fuck off - the 3D printed lower has thicker walls.
[09:05:50] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=raifu
[09:05:51] <yuken> Milspec pins aren't long enough.
[09:06:02] <yuken> These are the cheapest 1/4" things that aren't just a... bolt.
[09:06:09] <SirSceptalot> lol
[09:06:10] <SirSceptalot> "Much less faggoty and much more American."
[09:06:19] <yuken> and bevelled/smooth.

[09:06:35] <Hunterkll> yuken's room in like 10 years
[09:06:42] <yuken> kek
[09:06:46] <SirSceptalot> ok, so we started the day off like this again eh
[09:06:52] <CableNinja> bruh I'm pretty sure hes almost already there or further Hunterkll
[09:06:56] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: and here's an example of one in the wild http://pm1.narvii.com/6086/1e58d796150c02a20931859eba9d491ec23cc367_00.jpg
[09:07:02] <Hunterkll> and that's as deep as we want to go on that subject
[09:07:05] <Hunterkll> or ahego raifus come out
[09:07:07] <Hunterkll> or worse
[09:07:09] <yuken> Hunterkll, ARM AKM, Garand, AK74, 1911M can't tell, can't tell
[09:07:13] <yuken> because I don't know my bolt actions
[09:07:16] <SirSceptalot> goes well with the camo outfit
[09:07:20] <yuken> unless they have the bayonets on.
[09:10:12] <parted> what do people recommend for PDF editing, that doesn't suck, and is preferably free/libre/oss
[09:10:30] <parted> i want to stop paying for Adobe Acrobat Pro
[09:10:38] <Hunterkll> .... welp then i'm out of ideas
[09:11:02] <Hunterkll> depends on the level of editing you need, really
[09:11:13] <parted> will accept all options
[09:11:13] <Hunterkll> just filling out forms? or creating them? do you need things like digital signature functions, etc?
[09:11:21] <yuken> Fucked, parted - there was a _great_ tool I used
[09:11:24] <Hunterkll> filling out forms i just use MS Edge 
[09:11:26] <yuken> and I forget its name, that filled that criteria...
[09:11:31] <Hunterkll> you can type text over fields, even if it's not a fillable form
[09:11:34] <Hunterkll> then save/print it out 
[09:11:39] <yuken> ALl I can say is - what you want, exists.
[09:11:42] <yuken> I just can't remember it :(
[09:11:45] <Hunterkll> well yes
[09:11:47] <Hunterkll> tons of options exist
[09:11:50] <yuken> because I'm retarded.
[09:11:56] <parted> editing the text, modifing text boxes, images
[09:11:58] <Hunterkll> if they're feasible
[09:12:04] <Hunterkll> is another story
[09:12:08] <JollyRgrs> foxit iirc allows you to do a lot
[09:12:18] <SirSceptalot> I used nitro for a bit, it was... eh. ok I guess
[09:12:19] <Hunterkll> it's pay for
[09:12:20] <JollyRgrs> free in $, not sure what level of license
[09:12:21] <Hunterkll> but not subscirption
[09:12:44] <Hunterkll> foxit reader is free
[09:13:03] <parted> not editer ^
[09:13:04] <JollyRgrs> ah, i think foxit reader allowed for filling out forms before adobe reader did
[09:13:04] <Hunterkll> and can basically do all what acrobat DC does (free reader version) but with some limitations/quirks on display
[09:13:07] <JollyRgrs> maybe that's waht i was thinking
[09:13:22] <JollyRgrs> or it lets you "type over" the pdf
[09:13:47] <JollyRgrs> so even a tiff -> pdf you could "write on it" and make like you were filling out
[09:13:51] <Hunterkll> well
[09:13:55] <Hunterkll> MS Edge lets you type over
[09:13:55] <Hunterkll> but
[09:14:04] <Hunterkll> parted: foxit editor is $159 one time cost 
[09:14:08] <parted> yeah i have a feeling im going to need a full "editor" 
[09:14:14] <JollyRgrs> well, i'm talkin about... like 15 yrs ago, lol
[09:14:25] <Hunterkll> typing over maybe
[09:14:31] <parted> you in USA yeah Hunter?
[09:14:33] <JollyRgrs> yeah, if you're wanting a full editor... you don't have many options other than paying
[09:14:39] <Hunterkll> but fillable forms in adobe reader was a flagship feature when adobe introduced the PDF extensions to make fillable form creation possible
[09:14:47] <parted> why is it DOUBLE in AUD
[09:14:57] <Hunterkll> taxes & conversion
[09:15:00] <Hunterkll> probably
[09:15:06] <Hunterkll> but it's a one time license like old adobe pro used to be
[09:15:10] <JollyRgrs> parted: just think... if you were in RUS... it'd be a lot more, if you were even allowed to buy it now
[09:15:29] <JollyRgrs> #CouldBeWorse
[09:15:30] <Hunterkll> if we go off just the exchange rate
[09:15:30] <SirSceptalot> life hack: do editing in formats meant for editing, then print to pdf. (Yes, I know it's not always applicable and your use case might be a genuine one, before I get jumped on)
[09:15:39] <Hunterkll> it should be about 215 AUD
[09:15:42] <Hunterkll> but you also have VAT and shit
[09:15:43] <xe0n> just buy acrobat dc and move on
[09:15:44] <xe0n> lol
[09:15:47] <parted> $252 AUD
[09:15:56] <Hunterkll> parted: probably vat/taxes/whatever then
[09:16:00] <parted> it seems
[09:16:24] <JollyRgrs> SirSceptalot: yeah, for me, pdf is a portable "finished document format"... or s/portable/printable.... def. isn't really the best for editing unless you are specifically making a form to be filled out
[09:16:27] <parted> SirSceptalot: I'm aware, unfortunately this is not for "me", its for my silly users
[09:16:34] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:16:41] <Hunterkll> parted: it's $168.54 at checkout for me with sales tax
[09:16:42] <parted> I can just use gimp
[09:16:48] <JollyRgrs> parted: you def. don't want some rando foss implementation then
[09:16:50] <parted> but my users can't
[09:16:50] <JollyRgrs> make them pay
[09:16:55] <Hunterkll> parted: so that's about 228 AUD
[09:17:01] <xe0n> business costs money yoooo
[09:17:06] <Hunterkll> so that markup isn't too bad for AUD 
[09:17:08] <Croran> Hunterkll: you have some experience with foxit?
[09:17:11] <Hunterkll> not really much markup
[09:17:12] <Hunterkll> Croran: reader
[09:17:13] <JollyRgrs> the cost of the software is far less than the amount of time you'll spend trying to find a free thing and then supporting said free thing
[09:17:23] <parted> xe0n: JollyRgrs: but then it will come out of my budget
[09:17:23] <xe0n> ^
[09:17:25] <Hunterkll> Croran: editor iv'e used, didn't support some things i needed, but worked well enough
[09:17:30] <Croran> for me the killer feature of acrobat is the easy graphic merge of multiple PDFs into one file.
[09:17:37] <JollyRgrs> parted: what budget does your TIME come out of?
[09:17:39] <Hunterkll> like digital signatures in fillable forms with smart-card signature support or something
[09:17:44] <Hunterkll> at least, defining the parameters
[09:17:46] <Croran> was super useful for submitting proposals, back when i used to do that.
[09:17:49] <Hunterkll> i ended up manually editing the resulting PDF format
[09:18:00] <Hunterkll> to change some parameters of the signature block extension
[09:18:03] <JollyRgrs> Croran: i do that with... CLI?
[09:18:05] <JollyRgrs> :P
[09:18:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:18:30] <Croran> i like CLI too but it was nice to have graphical preview and drag/drop individual pages
[09:18:32] <Hunterkll> parted: so it's a one-time license cost for this, and if you add on... apparently $31 USD, you get the next major release included as well 
[09:18:43] <Hunterkll> compare that to your subscription costs, give the trial a spin, and make the cost estimate over that
[09:19:01] <JollyRgrs> now to chug an entire water bottle (just those little 16.9 floz ones) before bed b/c of my stupid dry mouth
[09:19:23] <JollyRgrs> something something allergies and sinus issues and making me a mouth breather
[09:19:36] <parted> Hunterkll: yeah i may end up doing that, was hoping to also solve my own pdf editing as gimp isn't amazingly easy :) 
[09:19:54] <Hunterkll> but like i said
[09:19:54] <xe0n> so you purchased adobe dc yet?
[09:19:57] <Hunterkll> MS office does have some capabilities
[09:20:04] <JollyRgrs> and yeah Hunterkll, i know i'll just pee most of it out in a few hours, but it'll make me feel so much better... tbh, it's my THROAT that needs the water. holding a mouthful of water just moistens my cheeks and tongue, but not my throat
[09:20:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:20:32] <Hunterkll> most of my company gets foxit editor, have to make justification for adobe
[09:20:44] <parted> xe0n: correct. but only 1 license for 1 users, and now the whole team wants it
[09:20:46] <Hunterkll> ofc you have to justify a pdf editor in the first place
[09:20:54] <Hunterkll> since that's a cost
[09:20:55] <Hunterkll> :D
[09:21:07] <JollyRgrs> parted: also, something to bring up to your boss... it's dumb that software $users need comes out of the IT budget... if a dept. needs that software, they should pay for the licenses
[09:21:34] <Hunterkll> we charge to team chargecode/timecode 
[09:21:42] <SirSceptalot> exactly what JollyRgrs said
[09:21:53] <Hunterkll> so a contract's overhead/whatever pays for it, or a department, etc
[09:22:02] <Hunterkll> if it's not in the standard suite of stuff we have blanket licensed anyway
[09:22:17] <JollyRgrs> b/c if it comes out of IT budget, just keep saying "sorry, no budget for this, request denied"... eventually, they'll change what pocket it comes out of
[09:23:04] <JollyRgrs> i think OS and O... sorry... M365 Apps are the only things we pay for in IT... but pretty sure even that gets charged back in the end
[09:23:49] <Hunterkll> eh, that's just part of the general CIO budget 
[09:23:52] <JollyRgrs> not IT's fault the company decided to buy out another $company and bring them into the fold... "whoops, IT didn't budget for another 2000 users"... that's why IT doesn't pay for it out of IT's budget
[09:24:09] <Hunterkll> computers, MS EA, AWS/Azure bill (unless it's for a specific project/customer), etc
[09:24:14] <JollyRgrs> It pays for it out of the chargebacks
[09:24:26] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: that should be out of the bought out IT company's budget until it's merged LOL
[09:24:49] <JollyRgrs> ok, i'm outtie
[09:24:51] <JollyRgrs> deuces
[09:24:53] <Hunterkll> we still running separate financials for one organization for some stuff .... 6 years after split/merger

[09:35:58] <yuken> yes
[09:39:20] <Hunterkll> zeroo errors, or logging configuration insufficient/never set up?
[09:40:22] <yuken> Hunterkll, by default, all errors/warnings are logged to console if you manually run the program.
[09:40:30] <yuken> or pipe it to something
[09:40:40] <Hunterkll> lots of software has verbosity levels
[09:40:42] <Hunterkll> that you can configure
[09:40:52] <yuken> Sure, but that's by default, and I haven't configured it.

[09:42:50] <SirSceptalot> "again"
[09:46:54] <Hunterkll> yuken's high
[09:46:55] <Hunterkll> again
[09:47:05] <xe0n> speaking of being high, i made brownies the other day
[09:47:08] <xe0n> pretttttty goood
[09:47:39] <Hunterkll> wanna get hiiiigh?
[09:48:27] <yuken> Hunterkll, no I'm not.
[09:48:43] <yuken> I did make a really heavy THC tincture a few hours ago though
[09:48:46] <yuken> like, 1-2 gram
[09:49:19] <xe0n> i put 1 oz into 250g butter :D
[09:49:28] <yuken> o crap, bedtime in a few minutes.
[09:49:40] <yuken> xe0n, this is raw distillate, so idk how 1g compares! :P
[09:49:59] <yuken> I mixed D8-THC and D10-THC, into olive oil.
[09:53:17] <xe0n> well errr i added 1 oz of bud and leaf
[09:53:41] <Hunterkll> 'bedtime'
[09:53:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:54:05] <xe0n> where he's going to take a crap
[09:54:26] <Hunterkll> well bed pans are a thing
[09:54:30] <yuken> xe0n, let's say you had 15% THC, and 100% efficient extraction - that'd be...
[09:55:02] <SirSceptalot> are you trying to calculate 100% of 15%?
[09:55:14] <yuken> 1oz == 28g~, so 28g * 15% = 4.2g... you'd have 4.2g with 100% efficient extraction. but oil/lipid extraction is usually only like, 33% efficient with THC.
[09:55:24] <sd> 10<g​eneraal eric™> Drugs are bad :)
[09:55:30] <xe0n> cool, so the brownies taste good and you get high
[09:55:33] <yuken> You need other methods of extraction, such as acidification, to get higher purity.
[09:55:35] <xe0n> so baking was successful.
[09:55:50] <SirSceptalot> I dunno, sounds to me like drugs are teaching people cooking and math skills
[09:55:55] <yuken> lol
[09:56:02] <yuken> hey no SirSceptalot 
[09:56:06] <SirSceptalot> also chemistry
[09:56:06] <yuken> I already had math and cooking skills
[09:56:10] <Hunterkll> long story short the yuken we used to know is a consumer of so much shit he video calls me and can't talk straight and when i ask him how many drugs he had he says "ALL OF THEM" and breaks down laughing
[09:56:17] <xe0n> well dunno about my math, the recipe said 100g, so i did 160, and the rest into the icing lol
[09:56:17] <Hunterkll> and has become much dumber as a result
[09:56:21] <Hunterkll> soon, he will fit right in to alabama
[09:56:24] <yuken> Hunterkll, hey, that's incorrect.
[09:56:50] <Hunterkll> yuken's going to be the next "don't do drugs" poster child
[09:56:58] <yuken> Woah now.
[09:57:06] <Hunterkll> this time it'll work
[09:57:09] <Hunterkll> unlike reefer madness
[09:57:53] <Hunterkll> its a really short jump from crack to meth
[09:58:34] <SirSceptalot> lol
[09:58:42] <SirSceptalot> besides alcohol, I don't do any kind of drugs
[09:58:46] <SirSceptalot> I have no idea what crack is
[09:58:53] <SirSceptalot> I have no idea what meth is

[10:00:12] <SirSceptalot> yuken, I am not joking. Well, I have heard "crack cocaine" in a number of tv shows, so I think I can safely assume crack = cocaine
[10:00:15] <xe0n> saw em last week lol
[10:00:16] <yuken> SirSceptalot, cocaine refers to the salt in its powder foam. Crack is the cocaine salt, in solid form - crystals, basically.
[10:00:20] <yuken> That are then broken apart.
[10:00:38] <xe0n> dem weed pills in the tv shows too
[10:00:42] <yuken> Common in low-income areas, versus cocaine in high-income areas.
[10:00:54] <yuken> Meth refers to Methamphetamine, an amphetamine.
[10:00:58] <yuken> Which is a class of stimulants.

[11:07:37] <Kiernian|Work> that would be handy
[11:08:25] <Kiernian|Work> I could never get into the walking dead. It always seemed like zombies for people who preferred breaking bad/grey's anatomy drama shows instead of actual zombie movies.

[11:09:11] <CableNinja> yeah its basically a drama show with a few zombies thrown in tbh
[11:09:56] <SirSceptalot> big bang theory is hilarious though
[11:10:07] <CableNinja> I couldnt stand that show
[11:10:18] <CableNinja> I watched 2 episodes and couldnt figure out why everyone liked it

[11:18:26] <Kiernian|Work> wow, there are like...three in a fifty mile radius from me. Sweet. I watched about a dozen of them close down years back and assumed they'd all gone under.
[11:18:55] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: mind you, some are just like, the back corner of an local hardware or hobby store selling some radio shack stuff type deal
[11:19:00] <Hunterkll> but a fair amount are full on regular stores
[11:19:22] <Kiernian|Work> I think the ones listed here are (likely?) full on regular stores: https://www.radioshack.com/pages/store-locator
[11:19:53] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: note the different type filters
[11:20:00] <Hunterkll> radioshack exprss @ hobbytown is definitely one of those types
[11:20:06] <Hunterkll> it's hobbytown stores with a small selection of radioshack stuff
[11:20:27] <Hunterkll> imagine the reverse of when half of radioshack was a cellphone store
[11:20:28] <Hunterkll> :P
[11:21:07] <Kiernian|Work> oh, sure enough. That changes it.
[11:21:20] <Hunterkll> 'authorized dealers' is the full store ones, i believe
[11:21:34] <Kiernian|Work> between all the begging for my location information and the top and bottom bars, I hadn't noticed that portion of the side panel
[11:21:39] <Hunterkll> well, that's not even true, bceause this on e in utauh is part of an ace hardware
[11:21:40] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:21:57] <Hunterkll> though it could also just be someone's holding company
[11:22:15] <Hunterkll> like the one i went to is listed as 
[11:22:25] <Hunterkll> "The Braun Co Authorized Radioshack dealer" but it's a full store
[11:22:30] <Kiernian|Work> speaking of begging for my location information...as a non-chrome user...when did chrome start allowing websites on PC's to start requesting the ability to do mobile-style notifications?
[11:22:36] <Hunterkll> yea lol that has to be it for a lot of them
[11:22:49] <Hunterkll> because i don't see "United Drug & LIquor" running a full store, but that's what it appears to be 
[11:23:02] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: almost all browsers have had that for a very long time 
[11:23:22] <Hunterkll> but notifications and location information are two different things
[11:23:25] <Hunterkll> and it'll tell you which is which
[11:24:12] <Kiernian|Work> Yeah, I know they're different, but...damn. I guess I'm so used to my locked-down firefox that I'd never seen it before until someone started squawking about chrome serving up porn at them a few weeks back.
[11:24:46] <Kiernian|Work> they'd clicked allow notifications from some shady site
[11:24:53] <Hunterkll> lol!
[11:25:00] <Hunterkll> yea, you can just disable that entirely, not a big deal....
[11:25:13] <Hunterkll> "I HAVE NO CLUE HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED!"
[11:25:51] <Kiernian|Work> yeah, I need to remember to occasionally have the "end user" experience just so I know what to lock down, apparently. I've gotten a little too close to developer-itis "works on my machine!" it seems.
[11:27:09] <Kiernian|Work> and no, dude fessed up instantly. IT is still believed to have mysterious black magic voodoo powers here. They all just assume I can see everything, which isn't TECHNICALLY wrong if I wanted to go to the trouble, but...

[14:16:25] <Activ8> I'm trying to re-find it
[14:16:28] <Hunterkll> if you've got static IPs, you can still use unauth login, or if you're exchange hybrid you can use the local exchange as your SMTP relay
[14:17:01] <Activ8> we have one company using scan to email to gmail, it's about time they used a new function
[14:17:05] <Hunterkll> yes, that exchange management box can actually serve a purpose lol
[14:18:05] <Activ8> also another company using old payroll software, same about that they can find new payroll software
[14:18:43] <monr0e> Gonna ask again because it was late when I asked last night. I need to start thinking about enterprise networking if I'm going to do this DIY be-your-own-sysadmin lark, so getting a second-hand router feels like an appropriate move. Money is tight, so its going to be second-hand, and I was looking at a Cisco 880 887VA that I could get for twelve quid. Is it worth bothering, or should I perhaps wait until I have actual money coming in?
[14:19:00] <Activ8> we not going to support old auth methods any more it's up to the companies to find solutions now we are done as a msp keep fucking about with scan to email

[14:21:44] <Hunterkll> routing/vlans/basic stateful firewall/nat/ipsec/etc the ubnt edgerouter stuff can do just fine.... and at better performance
[14:21:53] <Hunterkll> the built in 3G stuff is probably worthless wherever you life if it even has it
[14:22:20] <monr0e> Hunterkll: Mostly money. I have no idea what changes are occurring in the networking space, though, sooo. I was also considering the possibility of putting some sort of foss package on the cisco box if possible - but thats a long shot. The caveat to all of this is that anything I get needs to be VDSL2 compatible, since I intend to remove the home equipment from my network entirely.
[14:22:27] <Hunterkll> as in there's no service aailable that's compatible 
[14:22:35] <Hunterkll> monr0e: not even remotely close to possible
[14:22:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:22:45] * monr0e grumbles
[14:22:50] <Hunterkll> if you want to learn about cisco ISRs that's fine but still
[14:22:53] <monr0e> trust cisco to be a walled garden
[14:22:59] <Hunterkll> you don't buy cisco hardware to put worse software on it
[14:23:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:23:30] <Hunterkll> but in that case too, do you not have something that'll passthrough and/or act as a VDSL2 terminal/modem already?
[14:23:38] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[14:23:44] <monr0e> I mean, if I could find another solution that was pretty cheap I'd go for it - but everything I can see is cisco.
[14:24:03] <Hunterkll> yea because that shit old and performance is garbage on those cheap ones compared to far newer stuff
[14:24:04] <monr0e> Yeah, I do - but its a consumer device. Ideally I want to eliminate it entirely
[14:24:25] <monr0e> Essentally, I'm trying to roughly simulate an enterprise environment here at home
[14:24:49] <monr0e> Otherwise I'd just buy a switch
[14:25:20] <Hunterkll> with edgerouter, all the 'standard' enterprise routing/configuration processes are there, (in fact, if you learn to configure it, you congrats, know how to configure several vendors virtual router products and platforms, as well as have the key concepts down for everything from cisco to juniper to not sonicwall because they're retarded and the ability to practice a lot of protocols
[14:25:24] <Hunterkll> i mean
[14:25:29] <Hunterkll> if it has some kinda dumb modem only mode
[14:25:31] <Hunterkll> then who cares?
[14:26:16] <monr0e> Me, because I'm a) pedantic as fuck, and b) having issues with this router anyway
[14:26:33] <bn_work> 3G still at least supported call conference management & being able to "un-conference" a joined call?  It seems 4G/LTE/(and now) 5G doesn't?
[14:26:36] <monr0e> speaking of networking I gotta go see if that static IP has persisted....
[14:26:50] <Hunterkll> bn_work: hm? I can do that on my phone on 5G (and LTE is 4G) 
[14:27:17] <Hunterkll> scummy cellphone companies just early renamed it 5Ge to sound more competitive ;P
[14:27:33] <Hunterkll> monr0e: i mean, in reality, a seperate VDSL2 gateway/terminal will open a world of options anyway
[14:27:42] <monr0e> In what sense?
[14:27:53] <Hunterkll> not relying on having that in the router/device/core/whatever itself
[14:28:25] <Hunterkll> even if all you can get is consumer kit put into bridge mode 
[14:28:35] <Hunterkll> in bridge mode all the thing is doing is acting as a dumb pipe
[14:29:40] <Hunterkll> most consumer router issues are because surprise, the software stack is dumb as fuck and outsourced coding
[14:29:51] <monr0e> Strictly speaking, I don't have a problem with getting something ripped out from an old org running in bridge mode, but I want absolutely rid of this consumer grade stuff.
[14:30:07] <Hunterkll> i mean, except for the modem here, everything is like that
[14:30:11] <bn_work> Hunterkll: you can join 2 voice calls together and then unjoin them w/o hanging up both parties?  What network are you on?  I tested that on 3-4 here in the US and T-Mob still seemed to be the only one that supported that on older phones
[14:30:11] <Hunterkll> we just have whatever the ISP gave us

[14:30:26] <Hunterkll> that's any consumer router vendor
[14:30:29] <Hunterkll> Asus is one of the better ones
[14:30:35] <Hunterkll> but it's still meh

[14:31:00] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[14:31:08] <Hunterkll> well
[14:31:08] <monr0e> For whatever reason, the modem likes to frequently just... hang up. For no good reason. 
[14:31:10] <csws> the L3 is SLOW
[14:31:10] <Hunterkll> with sim cards in them
[14:31:23] <Hunterkll> monr0e: sounds more like stereotypical DSL tech trouble to me :D
[14:31:24] <csws> but you can create a bridge group with them and use something good like OPNsense
[14:31:40] <csws> and then you can make a management interface, slap that on a VLAN and it's all good!
[14:31:59] <Hunterkll> monr0e: I loved one where internet speeds at one office we supported slowed to a crawl .... because it was a hot day 
[14:32:00] <Hunterkll> :D
[14:32:10] <csws> my gripes are: it's incredibly slow to train and it's incredibly slow to boot
[14:32:24] <bn_work> Hunterkll: how old are your current phones?  on my iPhone 5S it seems to luckily still work, but not on newer iPhone (or Android) it seems
[14:32:37] <csws> jfc 5s
[14:32:44] <monr0e> I dunno man. A few of my ISP's techs have commented that the sheer number of disconnects is kinda weird. I just want something a bit less... *poopy*
[14:33:03] <Hunterkll> bn_work: 11 Pro Max (on formerly 14.3/14.8 and now 15.1) and Note 10+ 5G 
[14:33:06] <monr0e> Maybe I need to go r/techsupportmacgyver and slap a fan on it
[14:33:14] <csws> monr0e, could be a lousy chipset
[14:33:33] <Hunterkll> yea heh i actually recommend Asus routers these days for the most part for people's home setups if they can afford them
[14:33:36] <csws> broadcom is typically the preferred option
[14:33:55] <SirSceptalot> LUNCH HOUR
[14:34:02] <monr0e> Possibly. It does seem to obey daemon rules though, which was nice when one of my ISP's routing addresses was falling over.
[14:34:22] <csws> SirSceptalot, indeed it is!
[14:34:24] <csws> what's for lunch
[14:34:25] <Hunterkll> Are you sure you want to update UAP-AC-Lite from 5.43.52.12774 to 6.0.14.13634?
[14:34:26] <Hunterkll> heh
[14:34:29] <Hunterkll> guess i haven't updated my AP in a while
[14:34:40] <monr0e> Hunterkll: Decent ones, I'm sure. I have a DSL-N16.
[14:34:59] <Hunterkll> that doesn't actually look too bad
[14:35:34] <SirSceptalot> csws, MEATBALLS
[14:35:38] <monr0e> As we speak, I went and loaded up the control panel. I logged in right after I sent my last message, and I'm still waiting for the next page to load as I type.
[14:35:42] <SirSceptalot> sorry, that was too enthousiastic
[14:35:45] <SirSceptalot> meatballs :p
[14:35:46] <Kiernian|Work> 6?
[14:35:48] <Kiernian|Work> SIX?!?
[14:36:02] <monr0e> Still waiting
[14:36:04] <bomb> meatverse
[14:36:11] <Hunterkll> *shrug* update it and reboot it, who knows
[14:36:13] <Kiernian|Work> I hope that doesn't apply to my AP-AC-Pros
[14:36:14] <Hunterkll> i did say looks :)
[14:36:23] <monr0e> No no, this is *normal* behaviour
[14:36:44] <Kiernian|Work> yup, it does.
[14:36:48] <csws> lol wtf
[14:36:56] <monr0e> Although I think there's an update as of the past few days to mitigate a bug, sooooo
[14:36:58] <csws> monr0e, is it only 10/100 ports?
[14:37:04] <monr0e> erm
[14:37:11] <csws> >Fast Ethernet ports for the reliable internet performance
[14:37:12] <csws> ha
[14:37:16] <Hunterkll> oh huh
[14:37:18] <Hunterkll> not as old as i thought
[14:37:34] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: 5.43.52 is apparently november
[14:38:01] <monr0e> csws: Yep, 10/100 BaseT
[14:38:06] <csws> apparently a mediatek SoC doing all the work including VDSL?
[14:38:09] <csws> didn't eve know they made VDSL chips
[14:38:20] <monr0e> really>? Mediatek do *everything* dude
[14:38:21] <Hunterkll> VDSL2 is very common in a lot of areas
[14:38:33] <csws> might just be an australianism
[14:38:43] <Hunterkll> welp, here goes
[14:38:45] <Hunterkll> updating firmware
[14:38:52] <csws> NBN shitlists some vendors
[14:38:53] <Hunterkll> hope i didn't have any prereq steps that the unifi manager didn't show me
[14:38:54] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:39:01] <Hunterkll> NBN shitlists themselves
[14:39:04] <Hunterkll> :D
[14:39:20] <Kiernian|Work> yeah, that's why I thought it was odd. Seemed like a REALLY big number jump for such a small time period
[14:39:39] <csws> idk monr0e I don't like this modem
[14:39:44] <csws> I wouldn't use it!
[14:40:35] <bn_work> Hunterkll:  interesting... on this (store) 13 Mini(s) + iOS 15.X, it doesn't work...  How do you know your phone isn't using 3G backend for voice and 4G/LTE/5G for data? 
[14:40:49] <Kiernian|Work> maybe this'll fix the bug where you can set an AP to only pull a connection from the cable and it'll still go and get it's link from the nearest AP instead.
[14:40:58] <Kiernian|Work> *its
[14:41:10] <monr0e> csws: I don't like it either. Which is why I want rid
[14:41:33] <Hunterkll> bn_work: contraction of 3G network in areas i work 
[14:41:34] <monr0e> Frankly, everything else about it is perfectly acceptable, if a little old hat
[14:41:36] <Hunterkll> :>
[14:42:00] <Hunterkll> Kiernian|Work: 6.0.14 is the first 6.x apparently released
[14:42:10] <Hunterkll> was still 5.43 versions before that
[14:42:14] <Hunterkll> and 6.0.14 was feb 28th
[14:42:29] <Hunterkll> bn_work: i also have a fair amount of... modifications on my devices
[14:42:38] <Hunterkll> bn_work: i suspect you might be running into stock firmware quirks :D
[14:42:43] <Hunterkll> i'd have to grab another device and look
[14:42:51] <Hunterkll> i have a few other VoLTE capable units here 
[14:43:02] <Kiernian|Work> eh, that explains it. I haven't had time to go digging into network maintenance yet this month. Thanks.

[14:43:22] <Hunterkll> changelog
[14:44:01] <Kiernian|Work> [UAP-Gen2/Gen3/Gen6] Fix wireless uplink related issues.  <---- sweeeeet
[14:44:08] <Hunterkll> so those intermediate versions it mentions don't apply to us i guess, we never got the 5.68 or whatever train 
[14:44:20] <Hunterkll> i guess we're gen2?
[14:44:21] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:45:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:45:05] <Hunterkll> 5.43.56 - [UAP] Improve overall stability.
[14:45:59] <Hunterkll> yea
[14:46:02] <bn_work> Hunterkll: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/comments/fpzr6r/ios_conference_calling_private_button/
[14:46:08] <Hunterkll> UAP-AC-Lite and Pro are 2nd gen
[14:46:18] <Kiernian|Work> how'd you figure that out?
[14:46:39] <Hunterkll> release notes for 6.0.14 has a link to the generation list
[14:46:45] <Hunterkll> bn_work: hmmm, i've only ever joined two aat once 
[14:46:47] <Hunterkll> nothing more
[14:47:23] <Hunterkll> as in, called someone, then added just one more person
[14:48:16] <Hunterkll> oh well, upgrade was quick 
[14:53:28] <bn_work> Hunterkll: yes, but what about the ability to go back to private for either of those parties?  On these newer phones (& I suspect the 4G/LTE/5G implementation) , it doesn't allow that anymore (CDMA never seemed to support it)
[14:54:09] <Hunterkll> back to private? I mean, i split and end one 
[14:54:14] <Hunterkll> and stay on the other
[14:55:56] <Hunterkll> monr0e: ideally, you'd want to end up with something like this -> https://www.amazon.com/PLANET-Ethernet-profile-G-vectoring-VC-231G/dp/B075JK94VQ
[14:56:18] <monr0e> Oh that would be perfect
[14:56:24] <Hunterkll> then, configure the WAN side of the router with the current VDSL parameters you have on the existing router/PPPoE credentials
[14:56:35] <Hunterkll> or however it's set up
[14:56:51] <Hunterkll> but obviously, you need a router that can speak PPPoE and VLAN (if ISP is using, seems some do, some don't) 
[14:57:11] <Hunterkll> but that's just a dumb VDSL2 adapter, router still has to speak the same thing and do all the negotiation/talking to the ISP
[14:57:19] <monr0e> There's quite a bit more than just credentials, but yes. This would work. Now I gotta see what I can find for cheap...
[14:57:56] <Hunterkll> read the reviews and they talk about stuff like that 
[14:58:02] <Kiernian|Work> HAHAHA, Hunterkll -- click the vendor link on that link you pasted in.
[14:58:17] <monr0e> what the fuck
[14:58:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:58:24] <Hunterkll> i suspect they got that wrong
[14:58:30] <Hunterkll> amazon that is
[14:58:31] <Kiernian|Work> I suspect you are right :)
[14:58:46] <Hunterkll> because you can see ships from/sold by versa technology
[14:58:49] <Kiernian|Work> I was trying to figure out if it's the same planet that's currently making me a phone and got a different kind of surprise
[14:59:06] <Hunterkll> https://planetechusa.com/
[14:59:08] <bn_work> Hunterkll:  I find the feature invaluable, ex:  call up one support #, stuck on hold for god knows how long, add/merge another call that's also on hold, and juggle between them
[14:59:09] <Hunterkll> that's the actual vendor 
[14:59:24] <Hunterkll> i just keep the calls separate?
[14:59:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:59:38] <monr0e> oh ffs that site uses ddos protection that I cant pass
[14:59:38] <Hunterkll> anything more complex than that i'm setting up a s4b/teams/webex/using my home pbx/etc

[15:00:10] <Hunterkll> that seems to be the actual product though
[15:00:19] <monr0e> I cant see that product page 
[15:00:26] <monr0e> because of the ddos shite
[15:00:35] <monr0e> which just endlessly loops

[15:02:26] <Kiernian|Work> delete all cookies for that site. I've run into that before. It's annoying
[15:02:27] <bn_work> Hunterkll:  it's a waste of time otherwise?  
[15:02:38] <monr0e> I do. It achieves nothing.
[15:02:40] <Hunterkll> bn_work: i mean, hitting switch call takes less effort....
[15:02:50] <Hunterkll> or just hanging up idk

[15:02:52] *** Quits: baxmoke (~baxmoke@152.115.62.220) (Quit: Connection closed)
[15:03:25] <Hunterkll> i can do like 20 line conferences from my desk phone so i never really cared and/or just IM people instead of call, or run multiple phones for different meetings so i can selectively listen toe ach one 
[15:03:41] <Hunterkll> i didn't know what you described even *existed* tbh 
[15:03:57] <xe0n> i just dont answer calls, problem solved
[15:03:57] <Hunterkll> i do know how to use telco conference loops and kick people off though :D
[15:04:41] <bn_work> Hunterkll:  yeah, but if they answer, while you switched over, they usually immediately hang up, conferencing them together is a way to monitor both, albeit the hold music can get confusing sometimes
[15:04:52] <xe0n> wtf
[15:06:03] <Hunterkll> lol right
[15:06:16] <bn_work> xe0n:  I'm talking outbound to call centers, you've never had to deal with multiple calls to support or what not?
[15:06:33] <Hunterkll> if i'm on hold with a vendor i'm not fuckin around, as soon as they get back, in your situation, i'd resplit the call and/or whatever 
[15:06:51] <Hunterkll> if i'm having multi-vendor call or working with people, vendor's calling into *our* conference bridge 
[15:07:00] <Hunterkll> or i'm setting one up for the relevant people
[15:07:13] <Hunterkll> every employee here can run a dial-in meeting and/or send out external meeting invites 
[15:07:31] <xe0n> yeah, if i need to have a meeting i'll do it on teams, or use a conference bridge or something...i can only talk in one convo at a time, others can wait :D

[15:08:17] <Hunterkll> this is the thread that keeps on giving
[15:09:08] <bn_work> Hunterkll: yes, that's what I typically do when they get back.  Post 3G, it doesn't seem like that's possible anymore, once merged, you can only end all calls.  
[15:09:32] <sd> 10<s​nwflake> didn't even know that was possible
[15:09:42] <sd> 10<s​nwflake> but then again, my office line isn't actually plugged in
[15:10:01] <Hunterkll> either way the situations where i need multiple parties involved is either a big conference call on one side with us merged in with the vendor, or with me having the vendor on another phone and me relaying information to the vendor or back in real time
[15:10:41] <Hunterkll> so i'd have to hear one and speak to the other simultaneously in the second situation, but we don't necessarily want them listening to all the traffic, which mute button kicks in so i can hear if the vendor has any responses otherwise while responding to the other team
[15:10:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:10:45] <riff-IRC> Does anyone other than me have a big box full of obsolete software and hardware kickin' around somwwhere?
[15:10:48] <Hunterkll> usually we just have the vendor dial in directly though

[15:16:02] <Hunterkll> amazing
[15:17:47] <bn_work> Hunterkll:  you're talking about work situations where you have the ability/direct access to setup bridges w/ multiple parties, I don't think most consumer networks offer that level of advanced capabilities (although I wonder if GVoice supports that...)  The 2nd "juggling" situation can be avoided if you just merge the calls till one party answers.  
[15:18:01] <sd> 09<H​aise> Hunterkll: kek, I wouldn't want to be in his shoes
[15:18:04] <bn_work> but that won't be possible going forward it seems...
[15:18:22] <riff-W2K> like that one guy that shorted GME and ended up owing >$1M
[15:18:34] <Hunterkll> bn_work: not in situations where i'm listening to potentially rapidly changing information, but one party doesn't need to hear all of it, but some of it, in real time
[15:19:54] <riff-W2K> when we had a massive transformer explosion/fire in Oct 2000 (which we didn't fully recover from until March 2003), one person ended up on the hook for $140M+
[15:21:02] <bn_work> that's a different situation yes, you're talking about if you already have both on the phone vs "till one party [initially] answers".  
[15:21:38] <Hunterkll> vendors can also usually conference someone in for you if need be 
[15:22:15] <riff-W2K> and there were times where we had 20+ people conferenced in, especially in Oct/Nov 2000 when we were trying to figure out how we needed to proceed

[17:27:53] <Hunterkll> It also introduces the kana very slowly as opposed to the language itself, and gradually starts replacing letters in each word with the hiragana after you've passed that section 
[17:27:57] <sd> 12<S​obia> I don't think they will. They're at least good about that plus the client literally requests me.
