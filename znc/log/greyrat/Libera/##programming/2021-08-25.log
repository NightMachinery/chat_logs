[00:57:43] <webNET4> somethingspy  i forget i'm drawing a blank here
[00:58:01] <droid3>  So if integer factorization turns out to be in P say and the residuosity problem as we know it is known to be no more harder then integer factorization. That would imply all the crypto algorithms that are based on the residuosity problem usually a quadratic residuosity for most
[00:58:12] <droid3> will be broken 
[00:59:09] <Izem> webNET4: I just got windbg, now I need to figure out if I can set a breakpoint from the exe
[00:59:21] <Izem> since it seems to only take c or c++ source files
[00:59:34] <droid3> My question is we still got the discrete log problem but i am wondering if the discrete log problem can be reduced to higher residuosity problem
[01:00:37] <droid3> Or if discrete log problems is usually consider hard then residuoisty problem as well as harder then integer factorization

[07:13:56] <smallville7123> further more the linking mechanism used differs from platform to platform as well

[07:15:09] <oldlaptop> These complexities have absolutely nothing to do with differences between different OSes, which affect all binaries of any description. They would exist if the whole world used a single OS on a single machine.
[07:15:27] <smallville7123> yes
[07:15:29] <vdamewood> For example, FreeBSD and Linux are ABI incompatible.
[07:15:32] <vdamewood> They both use ELF.
[07:15:39] <smallville7123> yes
[07:15:43] <vdamewood> (Though, FreeBSD does support the Linux ABI separately.)
[07:15:52] <[itchyjunk]> end OS'es, firmwares are the future
[07:16:06] <smallville7123> ALSO, linux and android are also ABI incompatible
[07:16:15] <smallville7123> even though BOTH run linux
[07:16:32] <oldlaptop> And, further, none of this has anything to do whatsoever with your assertion that ABI compatibility between software written in C (or languages you consider sufficiently similar to C) and software written in languages that are not C.
[07:16:34] <smallville7123> (tho android is a modified version of linux)
[07:16:43] <oldlaptop> *ABI compatibility is impossible between...
[07:17:04] <webNET4> android fractured both linux and java
[07:17:57] <webNET4> that was one of the reasons that judge ruled in favor of oracle before it got overturned
[07:18:10] <oldlaptop> If you wished to advance this position *and* you knew the subject well enough to do so, you might point out (for example) that some OSes do not provide any stable system call interfaces that don't go through their C standard libraries. (macOS and OpenBSD both come to mind.)
[07:18:11] <smallville7123> basically my point is, that you CANNOT simply compile an Object file .o and expect it to link with your application on every platform, the same is true for libraries both static and shared
[07:18:12] <vdamewood> So, anyway, I've written assembly code that was callable by C code before. And with a few macros I could even make a routine that is compatible with both Linux and Windows. I *think* the calling conventions on Intel macOS and x86-64 Linux are the same, so I would only have to determine Windows or not-Windows.

[07:38:00] <smallville7123> tho optimizations in execution would boil down to simply improving the output generation, eg taking advantage of new ASM instructions of the cpu, or specific special calls
[07:38:47] <smallville7123> (tho highly unlikely unless the target is radically different in some way)
[07:40:11] <smallville7123> eg it could include improvements that allow for code to be compiled 25% faster on the target platform compared to compiling on the host platform

[07:47:33] <smallville7123> for example, gradle CANNOT be run/compiled on android's version of java
[07:47:47] <webNET4> in gcc there is a RTL layer closer to final output than GIMPLE

[08:41:14] <vdamewood> Izem: You can link with a DLL at built time, but there's a companion .lib file and you would link to that.
[08:41:46] <Izem> ok, thanks
[08:41:51] <vdamewood> So, if you have foo-dll.lib and foo.dll, you would link with foo-dll.lib, and your program would load foo.dll at runtime.

[13:41:08] <pyzozord> Akronymus: they can't because by that standard more than half of the people in corporations would need to be called out like that :D

[16:16:01] <beaky> yes the idea is to get into compression
[16:16:20] <mrig> you could just fill that though, no need to sort it as is sorts itself.
[16:16:58] <mrig> if you make 8 bitvectors, you could fallback to a linked datastructure after the 8th occurrences of a digit.
[16:17:29] <pyzozord> then question is can 10mb hold counters for 1 milion elements? and how big the counters can be
[16:18:11] <Akronymus> Would be roughly a byte per value
[16:18:12] <pyzozord> wait... Isn't 1 milion integers less than 10mb?
[16:18:16] <Akronymus> Mega = million
[16:18:30] <Akronymus> A int is 4/8 bytes
[16:18:47] <Akronymus> Oh wait,

[16:19:15] <mrig> oh I got the math wrong they are smaller than that too, 1000000 / 8 is 125000 bytes
[16:19:15] <pyzozord> beaky: the integers are signed 32 bit, right?
[16:19:20] <Akronymus> But sorting htem would be SLOW

[16:23:58] <pyzozord> maybe something like a trie but for numbers would compress it into 10mb

[17:56:57] <PlanckWalk> From a signal-processing point of view, all you can do is transform to a form such that *important* features are separated from unimportant ones.

[17:57:42] <a_train[m]> you could try to make it "smart" and look for a set of frequencies that should have a certain proportional amplitude relative to each other. Maybe some smart guessing about the distance too (frequencies travels differently).
[17:57:49] <DnzAtWrk> at first I hoped there would be some kind of local normalization for frequency spectrums

[17:58:50] <DnzAtWrk> hmm
[17:59:04] <a_train[m]> you'll have to experiment a lot and use best practices. The easiest general solution would be machine learning I guess, but you'd still have to be informed about what features you're using (or just add a reasonable bunch and let the AI figure it out).
[17:59:19] <DnzAtWrk> machine learning is a bit black boxy usually

[18:00:07] <DnzAtWrk> is there some kind of... frequency spectrum smoothing model
[18:00:14] <DnzAtWrk> which kinda thresholds important frequencies
[18:00:35] <DnzAtWrk> so most of it becomes 0 and then goes up to 1 at frequencies which are important enough to not be background noise
[18:00:39] <a_train[m]> it really all depends on exactly what you're solving here and what kind of company you're working at. If it's a 10$ toy, who cares. If it's medical or civilian vehicle equipment, you should have various certificates before you work on such things.
[18:00:51] <DnzAtWrk> it's not important

[18:03:14] <a_train[m]> is it in actuality radio, or actually audio?
[18:03:15] <DnzAtWrk> for work
[18:04:17] <DnzAtWrk> I do want to learn the different methods of extracting features from frequency spectrums
[18:04:24] <a_train[m]> do they pay you for this or is there a reasonable award to be expected? Has the company earned your effort of doing this?
[18:04:26] <DnzAtWrk> which aren't just picking a pre-known frequency
[18:04:59] <DnzAtWrk> I work in academia, that should be answer
[18:05:01] <DnzAtWrk> enough
[18:05:06] <a_train[m]> unless you're solving specific problems with specific applications and wanna go general, AI is the most bang for the buck I guess.
[18:05:07] <DnzAtWrk> answer enough*
[18:05:30] <a_train[m]> It matters, because you may or may not have the resources you need.
[18:05:36] <DnzAtWrk> AI works but it's a cheat. And it is a good idea to see if you can extract relevant features first
[18:05:43] <DnzAtWrk> without over-relying on a ML to find it for you
[18:05:56] <DnzAtWrk> eh, if it takes longer than a few weeks it's not worth the effort
[18:06:52] <DnzAtWrk> I can just train a model to do it for me :P
[18:08:35] <a_train[m]> It depends. You don't build a "formal model" of speech for example. It's fill with features that aren't formalized in simple formulas. The amount of interconnected neurons and cultures and human physiology (and the variations in humans) etc etc makes the word "catfish" in Spanish (or a solution that captures several words) a very very non-deduced and mathematically "non-formal" thing in a sense. You'll just have to record the statistics
[18:08:35] <a_train[m]> of such things in a giant bloated computational model.
[18:08:53] <a_train[m]> it's just nature

[20:53:13] <vdamewood> I think I watched that one.
[20:53:20] <piou> Lyn: yeah, it's not sending the private key, what you see is normal, it's sending the public key associated to the private key, no issue there. I'm not familiar with ssh from windows, but I'm weirded out by these paths "C:\\Users\\Yoga/.ssh/id_rsa", are you certain that mixing path separators is well understood? Because I doubt so
[20:53:23] <pyzozord> I like LGR
[20:54:01] <Lyn> well it's not me who's mixing the path separators, so I guess it works, at least in the past it has
[20:54:04] <vdamewood> piou: Looks like OpenSSH included with Windows.
[20:54:18] <pyzozord> It's strange how all those channels I though were my discoveries and noone else would know about them turn out to be all the same stuff everyone on irc knows about
[20:54:38] <vdamewood> So, being OpenSSH it should work the same as on Linux and macOS.
[20:55:20] <piou> vdamewood: sure, but that doesn't answer the question since neither Linux nor macos are at risk of mixing path separators
[20:55:31] <[itchyjunk]> lol registar rar
[20:55:35] <[itchyjunk]> I remember that screen
[20:56:25] <vdamewood> piou: Well, for what it's worth, OpenSSH has been an included part of Windows 10 for about 2 years now and mixing path separators hasn't been much of a problem.

[23:49:58] <pulse> i would imagine COBOL is more like a 40 year old whisky
[23:50:16] <GeDaMo> It's probably C
[23:51:11] <APic> But then what is Pepsi?

[23:51:24] <APic> Pascal?
[23:51:39] <^-^hi> Corrosive, unhealthy, causes obesity yet popular? indeed JS.
[23:52:00] <pulse> lol
[23:52:08] <pulse> APic, no pepsi is python
[23:53:03] <Stefan26> "what is the coca-cola of programming languages" what's that mean
[23:53:08] <Stefan26> coca cola is positive to you?
[23:53:17] <Stefan26> best-in-class programming language?
[23:53:58] <pyzozord> doesn't look like much, but my s(dl)tterm looks like this https://imgur.com/a/spjWg3S

[23:54:17] <pyzozord> that strange orange blob is randomly different colors for each run I don't know why
[23:54:19] <pulse> Stefan26, overly used and unhealthy
[23:54:19] <deniska> bad for you but sorta enjoyable and everyone uses it? Sounds like JS
[23:54:22] <deniska> C also works
[23:54:40] <pulse> C is obviously water
[23:54:46] <pulse> basis for all other drinks
[23:54:47] <pyzozord> but that blob is my actual bash prompt, just kind of mushed together
[23:54:48] <pulse> :p
[23:54:49] <deniska> but then pepsi should be a similarly popular thing which most people only drink because coke is not available at a place
[23:54:58] <pulse> hmm
[23:55:01] <pulse> 3meta7me
[23:55:08] <deniska> "is pepsi ok?"
[23:55:21] *** Joins: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun)
[23:56:17] <deniska> coca-cola and pepsi are c# and java
[23:56:28] <deniska> or vice versa
[23:56:43] <piou> Coca-cola is designed for the masses, for familiar use rather than on occasion, and it is quite a well designed beverage truthfully. They've hit a really masterful balance of flavors where you can't identify any of the natural aromas : it doesn't taste of orange or lime or curcumin or cinnamon or anything. It tastes of coca-cola, a taste that is recognized everywhere in the world. Strong
[23:56:49] <piou> marketing? You bet. But they did real work on the product too.
[23:57:21] <piou> So Coca-cola as python is probably right, and not in a derogatory way, just a familiar beverage fit for a little joy on any day.

[23:57:47] * piou probably gets much too heated for sodas
[23:57:48] <Stefan26> "Stefan26, overly used and unhealthy" ... "designed for the masses" ... that's what coca cola is to you? to me it's "Better taste than all competition so far"
[23:58:19] <pyzozord> has anyone said C is vodka?
[23:58:42] <GeDaMo> Made from potatoes? :P
[23:58:49] <Stefan26> My savings is 10% coca cola stocks
[23:58:52] <piou> Stefan26: I'm not sure why you seem to take "designed for the masses" as a bad thing
[23:58:57] <pyzozord> Because C is definitely vodka...
[23:59:09] <pyzozord> Python is whyskey.
[23:59:23] <deniska> python is beer
[23:59:25] <Stefan26> I'm sorry piou; I wish I could take that back
[23:59:41] <pyzozord> JavaScript is salted tap water.
[23:59:41] <Stefan26> read your whole story too fast
[23:59:55] <^-^hi> what is lisp?
