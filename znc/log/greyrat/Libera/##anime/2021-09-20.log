[00:34:55] <isekaijin> ‚áßhe Windows registry is an absolutely fucking mess. My most heartfelt condolences to anyone who has to deal with it.
[00:35:33] <isekaijin> It is difficult to make backups of your current configuration, in case you fuck something up and need to restore a previous state.

[00:40:10] <Bco1981> takes an entire backup. so you can restore on a new drive if you want to
[00:40:19] <Bco1981> correct and complete backup
[00:40:25] <isekaijin> Yeah, but I do not want an entire backup. I want a backup of the part I am actually going to modify.
[00:40:33] <Bco1981> you should
[00:40:35] <Bco1981> wat that
[00:40:38] <Bco1981> want*
[00:40:43] <isekaijin> Um, no?
[00:40:51] <isekaijin> My configuration could be very large.
[00:41:05] <Bco1981> then your configuration is wrong.

[00:41:23] <Bco1981> you don't backup everything
[00:41:35] <isekaijin> You literally said ‚Äútakes an entire backup‚Äù.
[00:41:52] <Bco1981> because you don't keep non-os data on your os drive
[00:42:17] <isekaijin> I am not going to back up everything in /etc if I only need to make changes to /etc/foo.
[00:42:29] <Bco1981> that's because i assume others also only has a OS on a OS drive and takes a backup for the "entire OS drive"
[00:43:05] <Bco1981> yeah i don't know if aomei backupper works with linux
[00:43:11] <isekaijin> I will just run ‚Äúcp /etc/foo /etc/foo.backup‚Äù, make the changes I need, and then (0) if the changes are correct, run ‚Äúrm /etc/foo.backup‚Äù, or (1) if the changes are incorrect, run ‚Äúmv /etc/foo.backup /etc/foo‚Äù.
[00:43:16] <Bco1981> but it works well with windows 10
[00:43:42] <isekaijin> Needing a third party program just to make configuration backups is completely wrong.
[00:44:29] <Bco1981> there is a backup option built in... i just don't like it
[00:44:42] <Bco1981> does not give me the options i want'
[00:45:56] <isekaijin> Unless you are dealing with insanely complicated software, your configuration should be stored in a single text file, or at most a single directory containing nothing but text files.
[00:46:06] <isekaijin> Editing text files does not need a program with lots of options.
[00:46:14] <isekaijin> Just a goddamned text editor.
[00:46:30] <isekaijin> Even nano does the trick.
[00:46:35] <Bco1981> heh... pleeb... not using reg editor
[00:47:27] <Bco1981> and you can export the reggistry database and tamper with it... in nano
[00:47:53] <Bco1981> the export is your backup
[00:49:45] <isekaijin> No, no, you get me wrong. When you create a *.reg file, that is not editing your configuration. That is editing a separate file containing the purported changes. That is ass-backwards.
[00:50:17] <Bco1981> true it's not changing on the fly... then you import your edit
[00:50:26] <isekaijin> You need to edit the actual configuration, and the configuration is easiest to edit if the configuration itself is a text file.
[00:50:53] <isekaijin> Or a bunch of text files.
[01:10:35] <ButterNoodle> hey cummers
[01:11:10] <ButterNoodle> why wouldnt you want a full backup again?
[01:11:47] <Bco1981> reminds me is should do a OS backup of my current system
[01:12:06] <ButterNoodle> I trueimage mine
[01:13:01] <Bco1981> hm... it's not free.

[01:13:33] <ButterNoodle> idk if it does scheduling and incremental images in the free version
[01:14:55] <Bco1981> Differential imaging? is that the new way to say incremental?
[01:15:05] <ButterNoodle> no
[01:15:14] <ButterNoodle> different from the initial
[01:15:25] <ButterNoodle> you only need the full and one differential to restore
[01:15:34] <ButterNoodle> not the full and all the incrementials
[01:15:44] <Poeticode> external harddrives are so cheap these days. Just run a backup yourself lmao
[01:15:56] <Bco1981> i do

[01:16:32] <Poeticode> in two 2tb external harddrives
[01:16:42] <ButterNoodle> if ur keeping ur backup on the local system that like using the recycle bin to store important documents
[01:17:17] <Poeticode> no no, separate system. RPi with a cronjob on your main PC that kicks it off

[03:33:24] <Roey> hee hee hee
[03:35:11] <Cryowolf> I wonder if I was super fucking honest and said I don't have money for a new couch (doesnt have to be 100% new, but my current one is broken so need a couch anyway, 2nd hand or not) because of me paying for my cancer treatments and pathetically asking for a small donation towards a new couch, if people would go "I'll donate if I can" or if they're more likely to go "fuck you" ? Because it's true almost all my money (definitely all 
[03:35:11] <Cryowolf> donation money) goes into an emergency account that I use for bills and emergencies related to cancer. As a result I have no money for anything but food, bills and rent each month. But my autistic brain can't figure out if it would be wrong of me to ask for financial help or not towards furniture? I'm also going to try selling things, but I can't do or give anything in return for donations because in Swedish law if I do...It's 
[03:35:11] <Cryowolf> considered an income and Ineed to tax it
[03:35:28] <Cryowolf> so would it be wrong? and I am autistic, so I really have a hard time with this
[03:35:34] <MootPoot> why do you need a couch
[03:35:37] <MootPoot> is my questionn
[03:35:55] <Cryowolf> to sit on when I watch tv or relax and I dont want to lie down in bed
[03:36:06] <MootPoot> bean bag?
[03:36:07] <Cryowolf> to have friends over
[03:36:10] <Cryowolf> so they have something to sit on
[03:36:39] <Cryowolf> to begin my life again, invite people, socialize
[03:36:44] <Cryowolf> now just sit alone in a corner
[03:36:44] <MootPoot> bean bag
[03:37:00] <Cryowolf> buying 4-5 bean bags is gonna cost as much as a cheap couch
[03:37:06] <Cryowolf> and wont be as comfortable
[03:37:16] <Cryowolf> and bean bags areh ard to find here
[03:39:02] <Cryowolf> so again, wouldit be wrong to ask for financial assistance considering where all other money goes? If Im gonna have friends over I need somethjing for them to sit on, a cheap couch couldwork even if 2nd hand
[03:40:07] <MootPoot> dunno tbh, try and see what you get
[03:40:22] <MootPoot> morality is relative
[03:40:37] <Cryowolf> can also work for watching tv and relaxing or playing games and relaxing. I'm not asking for money to upgrade my computer. I mean I dunno if I could but even I with my autistic brain finds that a little bit distasteful
[03:41:15] <MootPoot> how about instead you just ask your friends to help you find an old couch or if they're willing to part with one of theirs for not too much
[03:41:17] <Cryowolf> alternatively I could get a bedframe with one of those backs that are padded and clothed

[03:49:40] <Cryowolf> I'm gonna invest in a rotary multitool though so I can refurbish my old desk, put on a primer and then add a non-wood texture paint. Or maybe just laminate the whole thing
[03:50:16] <Cryowolf> curve the edges and soften them and then I have a "new" desk
[03:51:41] <gh0s1> Random idea
[03:51:49] <gh0s1> You could vinyl wrap the desk

[04:34:57] <coltigore> the ultiamte question
[04:35:12] <coltigore> what's the better weeb console, the switch, or the playstation
[04:38:33] <MootPoot> PlayStation ofc
[04:38:49] <MootPoot> Both have weeb games but what true weeb goes outside 
[04:38:57] <MootPoot> And requires portability in a console 
[04:45:31] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Love Live! (Shin Series Project) | Episode: 8
[04:47:31] <Cryowolf> the switch, because Nintendo doesn't force developers to censor their games
[04:47:56] <Cryowolf> "that skirt is too short, better make her wear pants" - "They said something offensive, change it"
[04:48:09] <Cryowolf> thats what sony does now
[04:48:26] <MootPoot> Nintendo games come pre censored 
[04:48:50] <MootPoot> Also I'm pretty sure theres at least one instance of Nintendo games being censored or changed per market 
[04:49:05] <Cryowolf> not in recent time
[04:49:23] <Cryowolf> they changed their approach near the release of the switch
[04:49:27] <MootPoot> Sure. But does it really matter 
[04:49:33] <Cryowolf> yes it does
[04:49:46] <MootPoot> If any game they approve is already nice enough to never require censoring 
[04:49:47] <MootPoot> Like 
[04:50:04] <Cryowolf> if what someone says is changed, this changes their character
[04:50:09] <MootPoot> Of course the person into supporting a dictator will never get censored 
[04:50:17] <MootPoot> Etc
[04:50:37] <MootPoot> Anyway I'd love to chat but I have orcs to kill
[04:50:37] <Cryowolf> I can't ignore them policing language in games
[04:51:01] <Cryowolf> cause that'll ultimately have an effect on narrative, story and most importantly, the characters
[04:51:05] <Cryowolf> their personality
[04:51:40] <Cryowolf> as for censoring outfits. I don't care that much but a "Parental" checkbox with a password wouldve been better
[04:52:57] <Cryowolf> It's just really dumb. Unless it's an extreme thing like a child wearing something incredibly sexual, like a string bikini or something. I can certainly agree that needs to be changed
[04:53:23] <MootPoot> Everyone is okay with censorship in some form 
[04:54:25] <Cryowolf> I don't support it, but I can accept it cause it sickens me. But again, an option to just turn that outfit off would be preferable
[04:54:47] <MootPoot> Semantics
[04:54:52] <MootPoot> And subjectivity
[04:55:07] <Cryowolf> I don't want Sony to touch games and unless they do something illegal, leave them alone
[04:55:08] <MootPoot> But either way Idc, private company can do what they want 
[04:56:15] <Cryowolf> I don't necesserily agree with private company can do what they want. I'm gonna say it depends on their size and influence and sometimes laws need to exist to protect the creators, workers and consumers
[04:56:42] <Cryowolf> but I would say if Sony is paying for it, they can censor whatever the F they want
[04:56:53] <Cryowolf> but if they're not paying anything, hands off

[07:15:38] <tsukkin> the bad news is i think leather is a really bad rfid blocker

[07:22:17] <tsukkin> no ljrbot at all
[07:22:34] <amigojapan> Yup

[07:25:07] <amigojapan> tsukkin: there may be a Mafia or were wolf channels
[07:25:21] <tsukkin> still not the same thing though amigojapan 
[07:25:31] <amigojapan> True
[07:25:32] <tsukkin> yandere was very simple 
[07:25:46] <tsukkin> and we had a group of like 20 people consistently playing for a while 
[07:26:00] <tsukkin> with werewolf and town of salem that kind of community is harder to foster 
[07:26:16] <amigojapan> Right
[07:27:08] <amigojapan> tsukkin: also amung us is a kind of yandere game
[07:27:20] <tsukkin> not as fun for me
[07:27:30] <amigojapan> Ok
[07:27:37] <tsukkin> town of salem is more my speed 
[07:27:50] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[07:28:00] <MootPoot> Me sentences tsukkin to be burned at the cross 
[07:28:11] <tsukkin> i like typing more than active movement in games 
[07:28:23] <tsukkin> maybe my reflexes are bad for videogames 
[07:28:54] <tsukkin> i like puzzle games
[07:29:37] <amigojapan> Me too tsukkin 
[07:29:59] <tsukkin> i just started obduction recently 
[07:31:24] <tsukkin> i wanted to like the witness but one of the puzzles just never clicked and i had to give up on it
[07:31:50] <amigojapan> Ouch
[07:32:19] <tsukkin> even with a walkthrough it was just super confusing 
[07:33:15] <amigojapan> I don't play much games anymore
[07:34:52] <amigojapan> I like making games tho
[07:35:19] <tsukkin> the way the witness works is really simple at the start
[07:35:24] <tsukkin> you just connect dots on a grid 
[07:35:41] <amigojapan> Ok
[07:35:43] <tsukkin> but then the grids start having different symbols that mean different things to solve them
[07:36:18] *** Quits: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[07:36:33] <amigojapan> tsukkin: have you tried aidungeon ?
[07:36:34] <tsukkin> and some of the grids are missing lines from specific angles so you have to stand in specific spots so the environment completes them 
[07:36:39] <tsukkin> which is super cool 
[07:36:53] <tsukkin> but then i got to this tetris puzzle and it just throws me
[07:36:57] <tsukkin> i have not amigojapan 
[07:36:59] <amigojapan> That game is kind of amazing
[07:38:20] <amigojapan> tsukkin: you need to sign up to really play, but it is free https://play.aidungeon.io/
[07:38:20] <ImoutoBot> [error] 403 Forbidden
[07:38:25] <tsukkin> so the puzzles start off with just a maze like this https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/the-witness/9/98/Entry_Area_1.jpg
[07:38:25] <ImoutoBot> [image/jpeg] 89kB
[07:38:33] <tsukkin> which is super simple you just draw a line to the end

[07:39:00] <tsukkin> then you find these and you realize you have to draw a line to separate the black dots from the white dots , also super simple https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/the-witness/c/cb/Bwunsolved2.jpg

[07:39:30] <tsukkin> but how do you solve this 
[07:40:01] <amigojapan> No idea
[07:40:16] *** Quits: kot (~lurkmoar@user/nekobit) (Quit: needs more desu!)
[07:40:31] <tsukkin> the solution to the third one is to draw a line up 2 spaces then go right and finish by going up

[07:41:15] <tsukkin> and the middle one you draw a line to either the top or the far right then cut off the one square and go up
[07:41:32] <tsukkin> but for the one all the way on the left is when i started to get lost
[07:41:45] <tsukkin> and then they started dropping similar grids with like 3 different shapes on them
[07:43:42] <tsukkin> trying the tutorial for ai dungeon now
[07:44:25] <davic> !later tell emmeka I found the canadian embassy in Estonia btw, nicely located behind a castle
[07:45:04] <amigojapan> tsukkin: in aidungeon you can type anything. The ai will make sense of it. And it is like an old style text RPG, just with limitless options
[07:45:11] <tsukkin> huh
[07:46:10] <tsukkin> in the defend the keep scenario i said i leave my armor and weapons behind and then it immediately came up with text saying i stabbed the orc 
[07:46:15] <tsukkin> wonder what i stabbed him with

[08:50:57] <tsukkin> gonna be honest i think this game would be way more fun if one person was committed to being a dungeon master and fixing all of the weirdness of the ai

[09:02:31] <sentionics> so I stayed with my parents as they had a generator. Could run a small a/c at night to cool one room.
[09:02:37] <tsukkin> oh part of the problem is that this game is creative mode 
[09:03:02] <amigojapan> That is lucky sentionics 
[09:03:21] <sentionics> but yeah, during the day just miserable. Either working, or reading a book. Sometimes watch TV. But kinda needed to conserve gas for the generator.
[09:03:59] <sentionics> Had to drive out and find gas stations that still had gas available for sale, and often there was a limit on how much you could buy, so hard to stock up a lot for generator.
[09:04:33] <sentionics> *working to clean up the damage and mess at my parents' place I mean.
[09:04:47] <amigojapan> sentionics: I would have no access to a generator here
[09:05:08] <amigojapan> Ah ok

[09:06:00] <amigojapan> sentionics: also guess no cold beer
[09:06:02] <sentionics> amigojapan: ah, yeah, understandable. thing about generators, need to keep them a good distance from your own as well as others homes, as carbon monoxide poisoning kills (took more than a few lives these past few weeks). Plus noise pollution.
[09:06:14] <tsukkin> no cold beer is a nightmare scenario 
[09:06:30] <tsukkin> i actually hate beer not sure why i would say that
[09:06:31] <denza252> davic: install davic under freeduck
[09:06:51] <sentionics> amigojapan: even with cold beer, I really would find being hungover to be overbearing in such an already miserable condition.
[09:06:57] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I don't like beer either, but sentionics does
[09:07:14] <tsukkin> i mostly drink soju if i drink at all
[09:07:15] <sentionics> though I thought about it a lot.
[09:07:29] <sentionics> I was sober until I had power at my apartment and was able to move back into it.
[09:07:51] <amigojapan> I see sentionics 
[09:07:52] <sentionics> involuntary sobriety is way worse than voluntary sobriety
[09:07:57] <tsukkin> losing power and internet for me would be an absolute nightmare 
[09:08:10] <sentionics> tsukkin, it indeed is my friend.
[09:08:31] <tsukkin> sentionics i live in the middle of nowhere 
[09:08:52] <amigojapan> tsukkin: sentionics was hit by a hurricane
[09:09:00] <tsukkin> that sounds worse 
[09:09:11] <sentionics> I tried sleeping in my apartment like that. woke up constantly in that suffocating hot air. Puts a strain on the body, but I'm out of shape.
[09:09:35] <tsukkin> that sounds horrible 
[09:09:43] <sentionics> during the day the heat around here gets over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and it's usually very humid.
[09:10:04] <sentionics> also, my windows are positioned such that hardly any wind made it in.
[09:10:11] <amigojapan> !c 90 f to c
[09:10:13] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: 90 Fahrenheit = 32.2222 Celsius
[09:10:18] <tsukkin> pretty hot 
[09:10:31] <sentionics> not that their was much wind for a lot of those days in my location anyway
[09:10:41] <tsukkin> there was no wind during a hurricane ? 
[09:10:48] <sentionics> the days afterwards
[09:10:52] <tsukkin> oh 
[09:11:09] <tsukkin> stockpiled all of its wind allowance and used it all at once 
[09:11:29] <sentionics> the temps were fine during the actual hurricane ha ha, just craziness outside.

[09:13:31] <sentionics> amigojapan: yeah, the storm was coming over me, but I didn't expect to have the edge of the eye of it hit our area. It smashed our little city hard.
[09:14:00] <tsukkin> do hurricanes just always hit super populous areas or is that survivorship bias in the news
[09:14:03] <sentionics> amigojapan: I lost internet first, then power not long after.
[09:14:09] <amigojapan> Ouch sentionics 
[09:15:05] <sentionics> tsukkin: you'll always hear about the the major areas and then maybe the most devastated locations the TV stations can find
[09:15:45] <tsukkin> if it bleeds i guess
[09:15:53] <sentionics> New Orleans was the big focus for this one on the news stations, with a number of other extreme cases that was just utterly totalled by the flooding.
[09:17:43] <sentionics> This hurricane's focus though wasn't flood damage as much as it was catastrophic wind damage. Never has my city seen this level of damage before.
[09:18:00] <sentionics> couldn't drive down any road here without seeing trees on houses.
[09:18:14] <sentionics> and of course, record amounts of downed power lines.
[09:18:17] <amigojapan> sentionics: there are emergency radios you can charge by winding them
[09:18:22] <tsukkin> it you think about it maybe the trees are just trying to avenge their fallen comrades 
[09:18:45] <sentionics> lol, I think of them more as casualties.
[09:19:01] <tsukkin> yeah but the houses are made out of dead trees too usually 
[09:19:06] <tsukkin> circle of life
[09:19:16] <sentionics> amigojapan: ah, that would have been a good to have. Though fortunately, we had plenty of batteries stocked.
[09:19:36] <amigojapan> Nice sentionics 
[09:19:43] <sentionics> I personally preferred book reading to the radio though, it got to be a bit grating on the ears after a while.
[09:20:06] <tsukkin> i can definitely relate to that one
[09:21:08] <amigojapan> sentionics: did your phone work?
[09:21:14] <sentionics> plus, when it comes to them taking questions, it was always just the most useless stuff being asked. Like, this has been talked about in circles for the past 30 minutes, and you still ask about it?
[09:22:13] <sentionics> amigojapan: yeah, but I restricted it to text messages mostly. My dad let me borrow a phone charger that plugs into my car's cigarette lighter. I used that when I was driving. My phone's battery was going to crap.
[09:22:23] <sentionics> it doesn't hold a charge so well.
[09:22:34] <tsukkin> what about fuel for your car ?
[09:22:45] <amigojapan> I see sentionics 
[09:22:48] <tsukkin> were gas stations up and running pretty quick ?
[09:22:55] <sentionics> I don't drive a whole lot, so I had plenty of fuel for the small handful of trips I made.
[09:23:55] <sentionics> tsukkin: no, only a few had the generators to function, and when gas trucks came in, and the pumps came on, people jumped on the gas pumps and bought them up quickly.
[09:24:06] <sentionics> to get gas reliably, had to drive out of state
[09:24:31] <jessedesu2> Should I use a vm of Ubuntu server or docker
[09:24:34] <tsukkin> sounds like you were relatively lucky overall 
[09:24:49] <jessedesu2> For database learning
[09:25:04] <jessedesu2> I want it completely destructable
[09:25:24] <sentionics> tsukkin: absolutely, easily could have had a tree fall on my home or car, my parents could have had their home destroyed, lots of bad possibilities that I lucked out on
[09:25:25] <jessedesu2> Sentionics do you work with data
[09:25:46] <tsukkin> jessedesu2 just use windows ^~^
[09:26:13] <tsukkin> i like saying that in this channel it annoys people
[09:26:13] <sentionics> jessedesu2: I think the OS doesn't really matter for database work. Just spin up your desired DBMS and work with it how you like.
[09:26:17] <jessedesu2> Microsoft has a Linux distro
[09:26:42] <jessedesu2> I want to compartmentalize it
[09:26:51] <jessedesu2> Make save points
[09:26:53] <sentionics> windows 10, you can run linux distros on WSL (windows subsystem for linux)
[09:27:02] <jessedesu2> I tried wsl
[09:27:14] <jessedesu2> Sucks when you try a gui with it
[09:27:26] <tsukkin> i had no idea you could use gui on wsl
[09:27:29] <amigojapan> sentionics: I think Jesse has Linux installed
[09:27:39] <sentionics> tbh, I always interact with either scripts, or with a CLI shell.
[09:27:42] <jessedesu2> I have it all
[09:27:52] <jessedesu2> Windows 10, Linux, freebsd
[09:28:00] <jessedesu2> Ipad for ios
[09:28:05] <amigojapan> tsukkin: you can with the new version. Or even before using xming
[09:28:16] <tsukkin> not something i mess around with too much
[09:28:36] <sentionics> I've mainly had to deal with MySQL and Postgres, but sometimes MS SQL Server as well.
[09:28:43] <tsukkin> i mostly just use windows for compatibility reasons 
[09:29:03] <tsukkin> technical stuff is kind of interesting but not something i have delved too far into
[09:29:04] <sentionics> I don't do major data work though jesse, mostly just the sort of stuff you expect to see in application code.
[09:29:43] <sentionics> I prefer using SQL over ORM stuff.
[09:29:43] <jessedesu2> I'm trying new things
[09:30:11] <jessedesu2> I co.e from excel spreadsheets
[09:30:15] <jessedesu2> Come
[09:30:22] <sentionics> ah, VBA
[09:30:50] <jessedesu2> I import csv files into tables and relate them and make forms
[09:30:59] <sentionics> those VB macros for excel, I've encountered working with those a few times.
[09:31:29] <jessedesu2> I tried learning that too
[09:31:33] <jessedesu2> But too hard
[09:32:44] <sentionics> jessedesu2: nice! though, these days, I personally avoid working directly with MS Excel. I prefer working via Python to do such interactions (and using CSV's are sufficient).

[09:35:18] <jessedesu2> Excel is robust
[09:35:41] <jessedesu2> Google sheets lacks certain features

[09:36:18] <tsukkin> i tried to play a game that needed too much movement a lot
[09:37:22] <sentionics> tsukkin: a good mechanical keyboard helps a lot, and training to not bottom out when hitting keys
[09:38:25] <tsukkin> sentionics the two games i was playing were one that used arrow keys a lot and one that used mouse a lot and i spent maybe 50 hours playing them all at once

[11:55:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: unless the game specifically says they are a religious zealot, im gonna chalk it up to bad ai
[11:56:09] <amigojapan> Ok DunceCotus

[12:50:00] <amigojapan> Yes
[12:50:10] <amigojapan> Well 26c
[12:50:28] <amigojapan> Not so so hot today
[12:51:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I also hate how Japanese people never pick fruits from the trees they grow.I always see them rotting
[12:52:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they're feeding the microbiome
[12:52:24] <amigojapan> Lol
[12:52:55] <DunceCotus> you should be careful about having such strong emotions
[12:53:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there's no wastage
[12:53:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if I pick their fruit for myself it would be illegal too
[12:54:01] <amigojapan> I want to eat the fruits
[12:54:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you seem wrapped up in legislative paranoia
[12:54:10] <amigojapan> Free fruits
[12:54:53] <DunceCotus> of course I would hesitate to pick the fruits also
[12:55:01] <DunceCotus> but mostly because I don't much like fruit
[12:55:14] <amigojapan> I see
[12:55:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I don't like the idea of biting into something that might be rotten below the surface
[12:55:50] <DunceCotus> or filled with maggots 
[12:55:53] <DunceCotus> or something
[12:56:01] <amigojapan> It is unlikely
[12:56:14] <DunceCotus> but not impossible
[12:56:25] <amigojapan> It could happen with something you buy at the supermarket too
[12:56:34] <amigojapan> You could cut it up
[12:56:56] <DunceCotus> apparently my mum said I would eat any fruit I was given but at a certain age I developed a strong aversion toward fruit and would stop eating them one by one
[12:57:37] <amigojapan> Seems like a phobia
[12:57:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there's something deeper for me
[12:57:43] <DunceCotus> right
[12:58:23] <DunceCotus> I think I must have bitten into a fruit that was rotten or semi-rotten at one point
[12:58:29] <DunceCotus> and that ruined all fruit for me
[12:58:30] <DunceCotus> xD
[12:59:00] <amigojapan> I see, a trauma
[12:59:07] <DunceCotus> I also don't like the tendency of fruit having bruises
[12:59:15] <DunceCotus> or seeds/pits
[12:59:21] <DunceCotus> or being under-ripe or over-ripe
[12:59:27] <DunceCotus> seems like a lot of ways to fuck up a food
[12:59:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: try  chopping then into small pieces
[12:59:46] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah that could work

[13:22:22] <tsukkin> it was a long time ago though

[13:24:50] <tsukkin> yeah i do the same 
[13:25:00] <tsukkin> used to more 
[13:25:57] <tsukkin> i feel like watching anime with someone is a completely different experience from watching it alone
[13:26:18] <amigojapan> We binged like 8 animes in like 4 days the last time. And one anime had 100 episodes
[13:26:50] <tsukkin> woah
[13:27:06] <tsukkin> i still have not started any show that had over 100 episodes 
[13:27:06] <amigojapan> Yeah. Alone I will only watch 3 episodes a day
[13:27:29] <tsukkin> i watched like 7 yesterday

[13:29:35] <tsukkin> when you said moon i was thinking of some kind of astrology phase change thing
[13:29:58] <tsukkin> like tomako is the moon goddess of anime and sometimes we get the binge moon 
[13:30:33] <DunceCotus> the binge moon is a special time

[13:30:43] <tsukkin> probably not the strangest cultural idea i have heard of honestly

[13:38:07] <Miyukii> the americans changed it from candy to presents
[13:38:14] <tsukkin> i think generally speaking human effigies in rituals are just not something i like 
[13:38:17] <Miyukii> or rather the european farmers that went to america
[13:38:43] <tsukkin> apparently most christians drink blood as a ritual ? not a fan of that

[13:39:57] <tsukkin> unless maybe as some form of incorporation of a halloween holiday 
[13:40:14] <tsukkin> may as well throw in a feast for the edgelords out there

[14:38:02] <Miyukii> then each family within those has it's own specifics. Usually it's only intel x86 and arm that are relevant though
[14:38:28] <amigojapan> Miyukii: different RISC systems use different opcodes and other grammars

[14:41:14] <amigojapan> Miyukii: C also sucks cause it is not memory safe

[16:34:13] <DunceCotus> my font now looks like the font in NEON GENESIS EVANGELION
[16:34:23] <Matt|home> i save like 50 bucks by shutting off the circuit breaker to my heater unless i need it for the shower or dishwasher
[16:34:23] <amigojapan> No Matt|home 
[16:34:38] <amigojapan> Matt|home: I don't have a boiler heater
[16:34:48] <Matt|home> oh you got one of those fancy hot water as you need it thingies?
[16:34:55] <amigojapan> Matt|home: those are not common in Japan
[16:35:02] <tsukkin> oh guess it was my font
[16:35:04] <Matt|home> well my apartment is pretty old
[16:35:06] <tsukkin> changed it to sans and now it works
[16:35:07] <amigojapan> Yes Matt|home 
[16:35:21] <tsukkin> sans font is vaguely nostalgic not sure why
[16:35:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: do you heat up shower water in a kettle?
[16:36:00] <amigojapan> Matt|home: and in the older apartment I used to live in. The bath tub would heat the water in the tub. So you could reheat it
[16:36:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: no I have a greater but it has no boiler
[16:36:33] <amigojapan> Heater
[16:36:42] <Matt|home> there are only two times when i take a bath
[16:36:56] <tsukkin> so none of the running water there is heated ?
[16:36:59] <Matt|home> #1 when ive had a stressful day and my vagina yells at me "relax bro"
[16:37:15] <Matt|home> and #2 when im really high and wanna read a good book while floating
[16:37:24] <DunceCotus> wait wait wait.. your vagina?
[16:37:30] <Matt|home> im being sarcastic :p
[16:37:33] <tsukkin> getting high and taking a bath is one of the best feelings

[16:45:38] <DunceCotus> they can observe us but they generally choose to ignore us

[16:47:46] <tsukkin> why not ?

[16:48:01] <DunceCotus> quite different 
[16:48:13] <tsukkin> alcohol is pretty fun
[16:48:20] <darkwitch> amigojapan, you also had some odd misconceptions about alcohol
[16:48:39] <amigojapan> tsukkin: have had terrible bad trips, and I am still treating anxiety I developed 22 years later
[16:48:59] <tsukkin> already have anxiety

[16:49:01] <amigojapan> darkwitch: like what?
[16:49:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah but you likely had dmt or salvia
[16:49:29] <tsukkin> urchin[emacs] sounds just a little bit closed minded for something that will never affect you 
[16:49:33] <darkwitch> amigojapan, like wanting to try "pure" alcohol because you thought it had such a wonderful taste
[16:49:43] <DunceCotus> which isn't the same as psilocybin (though shrooms can also incur bad trips)
[16:49:47] <Urchin[emacs]> tsukkin: wtf?
[16:49:51] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it smells good
[16:50:02] <amigojapan> darkwitch: that's not a misconception
[16:50:17] <tsukkin> pretty sure ' pure ' alcohol is just stuff like everclear 
[16:50:33] <darkwitch> amigojapan, it does not! you were smelling hand sanitizers and their perfumed additives
[16:50:41] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I mean ethanol
[16:50:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: or it could have been synthetic weed
[16:50:52] <tsukkin> you mean the one that makes you go blind ?

[19:12:12] <tsukkin> pretty much

[19:39:12] <SpiritOfSummer> this is a pathetic thing to argue over

[20:00:26] <ButterNoodle> yes

You're hit by a truck and reincarnate in another world as a cute girl, and now all the male adventurers are trying to hit on you, but you're still you and you still like girls, so you go become an adventurer to rescue the princess, and you defeat the bad guy and save the princess and she's like, "my heroine!" and you're like, "can I get 
[21:51:30] <Nanobot> a kiss?" but the princess finds that question inappropriate, because rescuing someone doesn't entitle you to that sort of thing; you really ought to start by getting to know her, asking her out on a date, and maybe giving her some flowers or some other gift... like a box of chocolates.
