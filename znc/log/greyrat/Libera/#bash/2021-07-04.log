[00:34:09] <kurahaupo> cut is extremely efficient; it does not buffer lines, it just operates a state machine to decide which bytes to forward it drop. That does lead to the issue that cut -f2,3 is equivalent to cut -f3,2

[13:18:46] <earnestly> geirha: That's what I do have although the EXIT trap becomes redundant and 'cleanup' can be placed at the end of the script (which is what I do)
[13:19:02] <earnestly> geirha: But if cleanup can exit, idk what happens
[13:19:26] <geirha> you never do  cmd || { printf >&2 'some error\n'; exit 1; }  ?

[13:19:48] <geirha> I'd say just never exit in the cleanup function
[13:20:24] <earnestly> Yes but I want to preserve the exit status of the process it stops (xorg) if I can instead of exiting with 128 + signum
[13:20:51] <earnestly> And while you normally can't set exit status, if it's explicitly provided as argument to exit, it works out
[13:21:45] <earnestly> I remember briefly experimenting with the cleanup having a bit of code to detect which signal it was called with based on this, but the '128' number isn't portable so I gave up on that

[13:29:36] <geirha> also keep in mind that exit 130 is not the same as killing itself with SIGINT
[13:30:55] <Helmholtz2> earnestly, is that == in IFS== read -r key value typo?
[13:31:10] <earnestly> Helmholtz2: IFS='=' if you want it to be clearer
[13:31:32] <earnestly> Helmholtz2: The only assumption here is that the 'name' cannot contain = (but the value can)
[13:31:41] <Helmholtz2> earnestly, if I seperate by ' ', is that IFS deault?
[13:31:51] <earnestly> No, it's assigning the IFS to =
[13:32:27] <earnestly> Helmholtz2: The default IFS is gained by using `unset IFS' but that's not necessary here as the IFS assignment is particular to the read command
[13:33:08] <Helmholtz2> earnestly, if I seperate the key value like -o as you said, like this : -v "name()" -o " " -v "text()" -n

[13:33:37] <Helmholtz2> assuming name does not have " " in it

[18:13:26] <gloomy> Hi, I'm trying to understand the behaviour of my pipe with xargs. I'm doing something like `fd foo | head -n1 | xargs dirname` (I wanted to get the directory of the first result matching `foo`) 
[18:13:50] <gloomy> (fd is https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
[18:14:44] <gloomy> So the first two commands just output a line like path/to/foo.png.  I tried doing both `
[18:15:38] <gloomy> * `| dirname -`, but that fails and only prints ".", and `xargs dirname`, which kind of works but prints 4 lines (".", "/path/to", ".", ".").  What's going on?

[23:26:12] <hsv> i know, it rejects valid email addresses.
[23:27:00] * hsv tried quoting "$exp" and it no longer works.

[23:28:59] <hsv> how does bash differentiate $ being regexp char vs. variable expansion?
[23:31:48] <e36freak> context?
[23:32:05] <e36freak> you can't quote the regex, no, that's why you use a variable
[23:33:16] <hsv> the var is expanded but there is no word splitting.
