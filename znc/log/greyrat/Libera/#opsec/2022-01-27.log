[02:02:06] <Joanna> I was listening to a podcast about Martin Luther king. Apparently he was murdered by the government for opposing the Vietnam war.
[02:03:15] <Joanna> I guess he didn’t have good opsec...
[02:07:39] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:22:21] <jan6> practically nobody has *GOOD* opsec, against state-level adversaries
[02:24:16] <jan6> only VERY few truly attentive and vigilant, and a bit paranoid, might be on a good level, much more on "somewhat decent" level, and most people, even of those who're aware, just don't bother, or bother much
[02:26:22] <jan6> it's not to say the state adversaries are necessarily too good, it's just that you never know when, if, or how, they'll do anything, unless you have insider info
[02:28:50] <jan6> of course, threat level varies wildly on how high your level is, e.g. just a normal person against them, they're prolly not gonna assassinate, although they might still just "happen" to get all your vehicles into accidents, or stolen, or such, etc, but if you're a significant group leader people actually listen to, it's a whole lot more risky
[02:29:09] <Joanna> I think the leader of france was able to avoid being killed numerous times but he probably had more resources than mlk
[02:30:32] <Joanna> If he had better opsec he would have to give up his public speaking which he didn’t want to do
[02:31:58] <jan6> country leaders obviously are a different story, especially if they're of a reasonably big country, especially if they're barely even a democracy
[02:33:38] <jan6> also public speaking would only raise the risk of getting directly shot in front of everyone, it's not like if he sent out written letters only he'd have been in any better position
[02:35:14] <jan6> governments rarely care about actual ideologies or ideas, only actions of people, if you spread stuff they don't like, they won't like you, if you stop spreading it, you're no longer an active threat, might still be surveilled, but probably won't be killed
[02:35:21] <Joanna> Charles de Gaulle was his name and he kicked nato out of France
[02:36:04] <Joanna> He must have been both smart and lucky. Most leaders don’t survive

The amount of cargo in which to hide contraband could be greatly reduced by people making the stuff they need instead of importing it. 3. There could be a program to recruit dog owners to participate with their dogs in bomb sniffing. And give certified bomb 
[03:25:31] <Joanna> sniffing dogs and owners discounted travel. 4. How business did a country that murdered millions of native Americans and other people become an expert on human rights of uigars?

[16:58:48] <JimBuntu> Joanna 1) I agree, lots of air travel could be replaced by other travel. 2) agreed. 3) If needed, outsiders could be recruited, I wouldn't really trust it unless they were basically the same as pro dogs. 4) Possibly learning from mistakes, but I would even settle for various countries not simply letting other countries get away with things, even if they did something similar before. Although, remedies should
[16:58:50] <JimBuntu> be limited unless someone is willing to go to war over it. Overall, each country is their own.

[17:36:01] <jan6> no u
[17:36:59] <JimBuntu> "why do you always do that?" lolz
[17:40:45] <Joanna> The usb kind of flashes the dialog where I can pick which operating system to use it with
[17:45:14] <Joanna> It’s kind of insidious to keep using the ploy that they care about human rights over and over as they destroy country after country. I once asked someone if they “care” so much about people how about helping the people in their own country first?
[17:47:05] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@46.162.234.238)
[17:48:29] <jan6> "which operating system" wut?
[17:48:51] <Joanna> JimBuntu: have you ever used a sniffer dog? If so are they hard to train? If there were civilians with bomb sniffing dogs wandering around alerting it could mess up the plans of all sorts of people including false flag events.
[17:49:35] <jan6> Joanna: it's always "us" vs "them" groups, you gotta make sure "they" don't do anything bad, because "we" are always perfect
[17:49:39] <Joanna> I think if I had a dog I’d like to have it detect explosives
[17:50:03] <Joanna> We aren’t perfect.
[17:50:24] <JimBuntu> I haven't used sniffer dogs, but I have been out with hunting dogs that track. That's as close as I have come.  My point though is that there are rules and regulations around professional dogs used for these purposes and I think those rules and regulations are probably overly relaxed as it is... lots of accounts of drug dog reactions being misinterpreted by their handlers/etc simply to get cause for otherwise
[17:50:27] <JimBuntu> illegal searches... that kind of stuff.
[17:52:03] <Joanna> Dogs have an amazing sense of smell. If I was somewhere with dog and
[17:52:59] <Joanna> I would like to know if there are explosives. Don’t I have a right to know if there is a car loaded with explosives sitting there?
[17:53:14] <JimBuntu> Think of it from the other side and ask what protections you would want... JimBuntu walks his trained dog by your house/apartment and claims it alerted to high explosives... now what?  Should the police be able to get a warrant based on that, keep you out of your domicile while they 'search'?
[17:53:38] <Joanna> It’s not about busting anyone it’s about my own safety.
[17:53:44] <JimBuntu> Obviously, a lot of this depends on the area it happens
[17:53:58] <JimBuntu> Oh, for your own safety, no one is stopping you from paying to get your dog trained
[17:54:29] <jan6> problem is that 1) you gotta understand their language, and 2) smells aren't unique, especially for explosives
[17:54:39] <JimBuntu> You talked about a recruitment program with benefits and working with either LEO or TSA or airlines though
[17:54:40] <jan6> some might have a fuse, some not, some be liquid-based, some solid
[17:54:41] <jan6> etc
[17:55:16] <jan6> change up the portions, and/or mask it with another smell, and it's suddenly a lot harder to sniff
[17:55:58] <JimBuntu> masking with other things is actually an issue, because they train dogs to trigger on the common 'other things'... not a big issue with enough regulation and protocol though
[17:56:14] <jan6> like you could totally just put a little explosive into a sausage, and just pretend the dog wants the sausage, instead of the bomb
[17:56:33] <jan6> or just cover it with cologne
[17:56:57] *** Quits: elink (~elink@user/elink) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:57:16] <JimBuntu> Masking works, but not well enough based on what does get discovered.  This is why some people have turned to vengence if not disguise. Using chemicals to hurt the dogs if they get close up
[17:57:17] <Joanna> What I’m saying is they hype up the idea of scary terrorists all over the place with bombs yet do nothing tangible to make things more safe. At the same time they refuse to face plane seats backwards to protect passengers from crashes like military planes do. In other words they don’t give a damn about safety.
[17:58:17] <jan6> that, and it's proven how ineffective airport systems are at detection, anyway, with several solutions
[17:58:43] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[17:59:11] <JimBuntu> Yeah, they have moved beyond dogs for a lot, relying on tech instead.  The tech is great when it works, not so good when people discover it's not being testes and that it failed some unknown number of months ago.  There is a true story about just that happening.
[18:00:18] <Joanna> It’s all security theatre the only people who are serious about security are probably the Israelis
[18:01:39] <jan6> SOME of it is somewhat sensible, but most is overblown theatre, yes
[18:02:25] <Joanna> The idea of not even being able to tell who is dangerous and who isn’t.. the whole thing is just a ploy to make it more and more difficult to travel.
[18:03:24] <jan6> uh, what
[18:03:33] <jan6> you NEVER know who is dangerous and who isn't
[18:03:47] <Joanna> If they cared about safety they wouldn’t allow planes or cars to be the most dominant forms of transportation.
[18:03:56] <jan6> also that's different
[18:04:27] <jan6> it's just overreaction after 9/11, to try to prevent plane hijacking, and also while at it, maybe other stuff
[18:05:05] <Joanna> You know that 911 was a drill that went live I hope.
[18:05:39] <Joanna> The nonsense started long before 911 I assure you.
[18:06:44] <s1gyn> SecThe security theatre also serves to get the populace used to intrusive government checkpoints and to even desire them
[18:07:39] <Joanna> It started using their unabomber mind control victim as a pretext in the 1990s. I remember the tv ordering people don’t forget to bring your I’d to airport...
[18:08:54] <jan6> 911 was the driving catalyst
[18:09:11] <jan6> it made people fearful, and wanting extra safety
[18:10:06] <Joanna> s1gyn: that’s right and it always escalates after the people went along with the id it became much harder to get I’d then there was the naked X-ray machine and the real ID act where they forced states to collect a lot of info and share it.
[18:10:43] <s1gyn> For a while there was that VIPR program where the TSA was doing a couple highway checkpoint, but thankfully that didn't take off
[18:11:02] <s1gyn> they still do train station mobile "paper's please" stuff though
[18:12:48] <Joanna> Before the unabomber there was the illegal aliens will get welfare benefits and omg deadbeat dads won’t pay their share!! Propaganda to steer people into putting their social security numbers in even more places they shouldn’t. Despite the privacy act of 1974 which got memory holed.
[18:14:23] <Joanna> Before the social security number on everything there was the war on drugs with asset forfeiture. and guess where the drugs were coming from ....
[18:16:38] <Joanna> The current situation has been in the making for a very long time one step at a time. and most people can’t see what is happening. It’s really amazing.
[18:16:57] <jan6> most people don't care
[18:17:02] <jan6> "it's how it's always been"
[18:18:03] <Joanna> Most people can’t see where things are going people used to say what’s the big deal to show Id?
[18:19:03] <jan6> no big deal
[18:20:02] <Joanna> It was once possible to buy airplane tickets from someone who advertised them in news paper and go to the airport and walk through a metal detector and get your boarding pass and travel without government permission.
[18:20:50] <jan6> but then hijacked planes pushed to news, and people demanded more safety
[18:21:03] <Joanna> It is a very big deal to have to get permission to travel. What are you a child or piece of property ? Take your pick.
[18:21:07] <jan6> response was same amount of safety, in a different coat
[18:21:27] <jan6> everyone's a child of their parents ;P
[18:21:58] <jan6> and you could view people as metaphorical children of their motherland
[18:22:01] <Joanna> The puppets in news media don’t represent me or anyone else who isn’t paying them.
[18:22:18] <jan6> so what
[18:22:51] <Joanna> There is one slight problem, the government makes a very poor substitute for a parent.
[18:23:06] <jan6> not a substitute
[18:23:34] <Joanna> People think the government is their parent.
[18:23:51] <jan6> it basically is
[18:23:58] <jan6> telling what is or isn't right
[18:24:08] <jan6> telling what you have to do to get X
[18:24:17] <jan6> what's baddie bad bad, and gets you punished
[18:24:19] <Joanna> It is more like a farmer raising you for meat or milk

[18:26:01] <Joanna> I didn’t see last line before typing:)
[18:28:56] <jan6> farmer would take care in having their animals in the best condition possible, to get the best milk or meat or whatever, whereas it's quite easy to "raise" kids neglecting them, only satisfying basic food and housing needs, basically ;P (even if it's due to both parents working, to be able to give best toys to their kids, they're still not with the kids themselves, and as such, not good parents)
[18:29:01] <Joanna> I remember my moment of awakening when I saw stranded people on tv after hurricane Katrina begging for help. Before that I had thought of the government as being a benevolent thing with a lot of resources that would send food and tents or something like that.
[18:29:20] <jan6> government doesn't actually have a lot of resources
[18:29:31] <jan6> it's all pre-allocated already
[18:29:55] <Joanna> It has resources it’s what it decides to do with the resources..
[18:30:09] <jan6> it's, again, pre-allocated, generally
[18:30:19] *** Quits: elkclone (~elkclone@user/elkclone) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:31:08] <jan6> if you budget for the next year and don't count possible catastrophes into it, you just don't have the resources at the point where it hits, and you can't go "now, every store and producer, give us something so we can help them"
[18:31:14] <Joanna> On that day I thought what a stupid country it can’t even help it’s own people after a hurricane how in the world would it survive a war.
[18:31:39] <jan6> usa is way more focused on war and military, than people ;P
[18:33:06] <Joanna> The government just doesn’t care if people are homeless. They can figure it out on their own. People pay taxes all their lives but when they need help there is none.
[18:33:37] <jan6> depends how smart you are
[18:33:57] <jan6> there is SOME help, but there's too little to help everyone
[18:34:07] <jan6> and it's not really advertised, in most cases
[18:34:10] <Joanna> They want all your trust and obedience but they let people down.
[18:34:25] <jan6> you just have to magically know that this and that help thingies exist, and where, and how
[18:34:41] <jan6> and under what conditions
[18:34:47] <Joanna> It’s really just a monarchy with puppet proxies.
[18:34:52] <jan6> not a monarchy
[18:35:08] <jan6> more oligarchy ;P
[18:35:16] <jan6> monarchy is direct lineage
[18:35:19] <Joanna> Nothing can get done without getting tangled in red tape.
[18:36:01] <jan6> plutocracy and oligarchy, not actual democracy
[18:36:20] <Joanna> Everything is bloated and inefficient and corrupt and confusing.
[18:36:27] <Joanna> By design
[18:36:28] <jan6> and in usa, you can't even pretend there's democracy, given there's only the choice of the lesser evil, even though both sides are pretty much the same
[18:36:51] <jan6> actually, bloated and inefficient, is not by design
[18:37:00] <jan6> it just happens naturally, and quite quickly
[18:37:09] <jan6> same for confusing
[18:37:29] <jan6> there's no incentive to make it LESS confusing, but it's not MEANT to be confusing, it just happened
[18:37:32] <Joanna> But most people think voting works. The only other choice is revolution which is not going to happen.
[18:39:01] <jan6> like, why are laws so complex? well, because they started out simple, then had patches upon patches, new laws, removing old laws, patching those, and tada, now there's literally nobody who knows *ALL* the laws and their intricacies, anymore
[18:39:20] <jan6> same for buerocracy, etc
[18:39:34] <Joanna> There is a reason that it’s confusing and that is people won’t get as mad if they don’t understand what is happening. Like the stock market or federal reserve they make no sense at all .
[18:40:15] <jan6> perfectly illustrated by this cartoon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHRGjfEQpy4
[18:40:44] <Joanna> The existing laws are not enforced for everyone.

[18:41:51] <jan6> Joanna: they are, if your lawyer knows about them, and their loopholes ;P
[18:42:35] <Joanna> I figured out that people are treated differently when I was a small child. How can anyone still believe this stupid fantasy that guilty will be punished and punished are guilty. People used to get convicted of witchcraft with jury trials.
[18:42:51] <jan6> there's so many laws that lawyers can pick and choose what ones they want to bring to attention, some might exclude some people, under some conditions, but others might still apply, you just have to know enough about it
[18:43:13] <jan6> guilty will be punished, but not proportionally, most of the time ;P

[18:46:33] <Joanna> They keep us focused on the criminals they want us to worry about while they murder and rob people by the millions:)
[18:47:01] <jan6> and also, the billionaires and such, are usually not personally responsible for what their companies are doing, either, they're not the sole deciders, although their voice matters the most
[18:48:02] <Joanna> The whole system is flawed and never was going to work for the benefit of the ordinary people.
[18:48:14] <jan6> it was, at first
[18:48:28] <jan6> but then capitalism grew
[18:48:40] <Joanna> Of course they aren’t responsible for mass murder.
[18:48:47] <jan6> nowdays, companies have MORE money than entire nations
[18:49:19] <Joanna> Who decided that businesses can murder people with impunity I wonder...
[18:49:20] <jan6> so of course the nations are gonna pander to the smell of money and safety to themselves
[18:49:34] <jan6> businesses don't murder people, that's the thing
[18:50:07] <jan6> e.g. if they fire someone, and that person starves to death, that's not the company killing them, that's them not finding a job on an open market
[18:50:24] <jan6> etc
[18:50:34] <Joanna> It’s not called murder so it’s ok because it’s not called murder.
[18:50:42] <jan6> because it isn't murder
[18:51:03] <jan6> it would be murder if they killed the person in order to vacate their spot
[18:51:31] <Joanna> Dropping bombs on people isn’t murder it’s democracy!!
[18:51:38] <jan6> no it's not
[18:51:55] <Joanna> It’s liberation!!
[18:52:01] <jan6> dropping bombs is military, not democracy
[18:52:23] <jan6> and military is generally the opposite of democracy, it's direct command
[18:53:18] <Joanna> Bombing helpless civilians who are just minding their own business. What is that ? Peace?
[18:53:28] <jan6> no
[18:53:54] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[18:54:03] <jan6> generally targetting civilians is prohibited, anyway, when possible
[18:54:08] <Joanna> They were trying to bring democracy to people who were oppressed by bombing them don’t you know?
[18:54:27] <jan6> no
[18:54:32] <Joanna> Prohibited by whom??
[18:54:41] <jan6> them, and everyone
[18:54:46] <jan6> doesn't mean there's much punishment
[18:56:08] <Joanna> I could list a long list of innocent countries from Vietnam to Libya that have been bombed into oblivion.
[18:56:39] <jan6> they didn't have enough Protection(tm) to retaliate
[18:56:53] <Joanna> Unfortunately not
[18:57:03] <jan6> and happened to have something that was considered either Bad, or Valuable
[18:57:16] <Joanna> So it’s might makes right as hitler said.
[18:57:30] <jan6> of course most people operate on "us" vs "them" basis
[18:57:43] <jan6> so "other people died, but hey, we won!"
[18:58:10] <Joanna> So as I said murder is fine of you use big expensive weapons.
[18:58:21] <jan6> doesn't need to be that
[18:58:27] <Joanna> And kill a lot of people
[18:58:45] <jan6> it's never fine, but war is war, and you don't win war by being a pacifist
[18:59:14] <jan6> of course, there's also the question of "why was the war even started in the first place"
[18:59:21] <jan6> which is rarely asked
[18:59:28] <Joanna> It’s not a war if one side can’t fight back it’s a massacre
[18:59:39] <jan6> it's still a war
[18:59:48] <jan6> it can be both
[19:00:08] <Joanna> War has two sides that fight
[19:00:13] <jan6> noun
[19:00:14] <jan6>     A state of open, armed, often prolonged conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties.
[19:00:38] <jan6> it can be "war" even if it's a group of 5 people against an entire state
[19:02:30] <Joanna> It’s easy to look the other way when you’re not in group being murdered. But I can say from experience that once they get done murdering all the outsiders they often turn upon their own population and murder those for fun.
[19:03:13] <jan6> that's the "us and them" mentality ;P
[19:03:34] <Joanna> It won’t be a prolonged conflict if only one side has big weapons.
[19:03:44] <jan6> it doesn't have to be
