Secondly, with crypto right now, people could jut buy NFTs and that would be enough to support game dev. And third, the only reason support is poor is because proprietary crap doesn't work.

[09:33:52] <sentionics> MootPoot, so there's modifiers we use for hotkeys right? control/command is a modifier key for hotkeys, right. do you follow that?
[09:34:00] <MootPoot> yes
[09:34:08] <kaizer> JesseDesu: Nah, but I've read up on Toyota. Landcruiser fanboy over here
[09:34:20] <sentionics> MootPoot, so like, VS Code has too many out of the box hotkeys
[09:34:26] <JesseDesu> so you know what 5S is
[09:34:28] <sentionics> hard to find hotkeys that aren't taken
[09:34:35] <MootPoot> yes'
[09:34:46] <sentionics> but turns out, you can get yourself an additional modifier key
[09:34:54] <kaizer> JesseDesu: 5S? Elaborate...
[09:34:57] <sentionics> on mac os that's the hyper key
[09:35:07] <sentionics> on windows, that's ancient ass 'office key'
[09:35:15] <JesseDesu> 5S is a japanese process for cleaning
[09:35:36] <JesseDesu> !g what is 5S
[09:35:37] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: What is 5S? 5S System is explained including tips ... - 5S Today <https://www.5stoday.com/what-is-5s/> | What are the Five S's (5S) of Lean - ASQ <https://asq.org/quality-resources/lean/five-s-tutorial> | What is the 5s System? | Definitions, Core Concepts & Principles <https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/what-is-5s/>
[09:35:39] <MootPoot> sentionics: yeah, what about it
[09:35:47] <MootPoot> that key has been around on most of my keyboards
[09:36:07] <MootPoot> although all it does 99% of the time is just open the context menu
[09:36:16] <MootPoot> unless you remappped it to not use that
[09:36:22] <sentionics> so it takes autohotkey script and a bit of C code to break the built-in office hotkeys and fully remap office key to be open for work
[09:36:37] <MootPoot> sentionics: there are also the F11-22 keys as well
[09:36:48] <MootPoot> although using them is a pain
[09:37:11] <sentionics> office key (and hyper key), it's a 'modifier' in a sense, but really it's just ctrl+alt+shift+window keys
[09:37:11] <MootPoot> since in effect they are all virtualized and most applications dont even register them so you have to use a macro app in between
[09:38:00] <gh0s1> ButterNoodle!
[09:38:00] <sentionics> MootPoot, I used the hack and autohotkey script to remap my right-control key to the hyperkey
[09:38:12] <kaizer> JesseDesu: Huh, you learn sth new everyday. Also, I could have just told the bot to search it for me???? Well, shit...

[10:15:07] <sentionics> I think maybe I was just fucked up before I even entered into college
[10:15:59] <kaizer> Maybe, but at least you were fighting for sth. Cause all kids are like that. Before you're brainwashed into believing that life is shit.
[10:16:32] <kaizer> I felt like that and I can tell you for sure that on the other side, you don't need any of that shit.
[10:16:55] <sentionics> kaizer, I don't care about life. it's probably good. I think it feels good most of the time. I just have to pay for it, when the buzz burns off
[10:17:35] <kaizer> You get your kicks from living the life you want. It's hard and complicated and different. I know. But you've got everything you need to live the life you want. I know that shit so hard.
[10:17:58] <sentionics> ah, you sound like me
[10:18:44] <kaizer> I believe it. Cause I've lived it. I'm telling ya. I'm not telling you to like be a saint or some shit. Nah, but whatever you want, you can have it. And I know what you want is probably sth healthy.
[10:18:59] <kaizer> Like a family or meaningful work
[10:19:10] <sentionics> maybe if I say, I don't know if we're going to hell when we die. I don't believe in God. But, what if I'm wrong, and some bullshit rules put me in the pyre? I'll be so angry at God.
[10:20:02] <sentionics> no direct communication, but dealing out eternal torment as a punishment? Such a god would indeed be evil.
[10:20:36] <kaizer> Nah, don't think about it like that. If God is infinite goodness, didn't he put booze here for you to cope? But did he want you to cope or to thrive? I am so sure that what you want deep down is sth that even he would want for you

[10:29:55] <kaizer> Cause you value the impact of your actions! 
[10:30:29] <sentionics> kaizer: I'm impacted most by the embarrassing moments. And the worst were when I was sober, somehow.
[10:30:57] <PancakeMatsuri> kaizer, in this world, we're supposed to save ourselves. So make your meaning and live happily everafter.
[10:31:04] <sentionics> anyway, no one remembers that shit but me I'm guessing. and if someone else does. They can suck my cock.

[10:39:54] <sentionics> IRC is a protocol like HTTP

[20:03:27] <pokhu> mootpoot: i used to feel that way myself, but over a period of time i started to get wrapped up in romantic fantasies and i was able to reach a level of immersion I only experienced before sleeping as a child. I eventually lost it, as a child, because I would start questioning myself, like sabotaging myself on purpose, but since I was doing this for masturbation all venues of my mind started to cooperate. Unfortunately it ended up being 
[20:03:27] <pokhu> so realistic that I was unable to do anything with her out of the same reasons i was unable to do anything her with her in real life.
