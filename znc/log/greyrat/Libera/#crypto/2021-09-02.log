[03:18:30] <Soni> is this a backdoor? https://twitter.com/SoniEx2/status/1433199035800858630
[03:19:51] *** Joins: moose (~moose@user/moose)
[03:21:01] <danieldg> no, deleting a key is not a backdoor
[03:21:37] <danieldg> a backdoor would be cloning a key
[03:23:23] <ms7821> is ransomware a back door
[03:23:59] * TimMc holds up a butterfly with a confused expression on his face
[03:24:09] <danieldg> ransomware is just a friendly capitalist reminding you to get your backups working
[03:26:30] <Soni> so basically hacking into someone's device and rendering all their yubikeys unusable is working as intended?
[03:26:44] <ms7821> who said that?
[03:27:09] <danieldg> yep.  Same as deleting all their files.
[03:27:32] <danieldg> you could have the OS stop you from deleting all the files and/or deleting the keys
[03:27:48] <danieldg> but then people would complain about that
[03:28:01] <ms7821> most people don't complain about rm -rf / not working
[03:28:23] <danieldg> no, but they do complain if deleting a directory doesn't free up space
[03:28:48] <danieldg> (and yes, that can happen if you use copy-on-write filesystems)
[03:28:49] <ms7821> but they also don't say the ability to do rm -rf /* is a backdoor, or that it's something a consumer device should make easy
[03:29:31] <Soni> if your threat model is someone deleting your keys with malware, then yubikeys are wholly unsuitable
[03:29:48] *** Joins: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[03:29:50] <danieldg> that's not a common threat model, but true
[03:29:57] <ms7821> threat models are up for debate though. this is why hpkp was almost rolled out globally
[03:30:29] <danieldg> Soni: offline backups of keys are possible, just like backups of files
[03:30:55] <Soni> danieldg: yes, you can have two yubikeys
[03:30:55] <danieldg> usually via allowing 2 keys to unlock, not by cloning the actual key
[03:31:16] <Soni> doesn't help if you get them both deleted, by plugging them into the same compromised device
[03:31:27] <danieldg> ... so don't do that
[03:31:27] <Soni> because you thought it was "broken"
[03:31:50] <danieldg> same issue if you plug in your backup drive while you still have ransomware
[03:33:33] <Soni> ransomware doesn't usually try to stay hidden
[03:33:53] <danieldg> it does while it's encrypting stuff
[03:34:15] <danieldg> and it wouldn't surprise me if someone decided to make a "induce the user to plug in their backup" step
[03:34:54] <danieldg> maybe make the os detect disk corruption in the next old-ish file you open
[03:34:56] *** Joins: moose` (~moose@user/moose)
[03:35:10] <Soni> eh
[03:35:33] <Soni> do governments deploy ransomware?
[03:35:50] <ms7821> wannacry was likely NK
[03:36:29] <Soni> yes but that's a worm
[03:36:56] <ms7821> it's also ransomware?
[03:37:12] <Soni> do governments deploy ransomware against individuals?

[03:37:23] <Soni> y'know, for destruction of evidence and whatnot
[03:37:34] <danieldg> worms are deployed against everyone, so... yes
[03:37:46] <Soni> *sigh*
[03:38:21] <ms7821> very likely, though I can't point to an example of an individual. but it's commonly reported that russia deploys ransomware on targets where they've had total control over the network, just to cover their tracks
[03:38:59] *** Joins: CrashTestDummy2 (~CrashTest@ool-ad02813b.dyn.optonline.net)
[03:39:19] <Soni> fair enough
[03:39:26] <Soni> so why don't yubikeys protect against those?
[03:39:38] <Soni> particularly for PGP/etc
[03:39:50] <ms7821> well so far I'm not aware of any malware targetting yubikeys
[03:40:00] <ms7821> perhaps if that becomes a common problem they will
[03:40:17] <Soni> that's because ppl can't trust yubikeys to keep their PGP/etc safe against governments
[03:40:35] <danieldg> you use a strange definition of safe
[03:40:54] <danieldg> for keys, a deleted key is very safe
[03:41:25] <ms7821> yeah most people using pgp in anger actually will be happy if stuff is deleted rather than anything else
[03:41:26] <danieldg> in fact I'd say that it is a feature to be able to delete a key
[03:42:12] <Soni> losing the ability to say you really posted some stuff is just as bad as other ppl being able to say you really posted stuff you didn't post

[03:42:44] <danieldg> but deleting a key doesn't imply the former
[03:43:14] <ms7821> I totally agree that DoS matters as much as theoretical attacks to most people, but that's because they basically never happen
[03:43:36] <danieldg> and actually I'd rather the former happened than the latter - usually I can re-bootstrap trust easily, but de-trusting an old key is harder
[03:44:28] <Soni> the normal user has one or maybe two keys and up to three devices, not a whole DIY CA
[03:45:01] <Soni> the normal user is very susceptible to such malware. this might not bother you and that's fine, but you do need to recognize you're not the normal user.
[03:45:45] <ms7821> my job is to advise people on this sort of stuff, and I definitely include it as a concern
[03:45:48] <danieldg> the normal user will use the keys to authenticate to github or gmail, and if they lose all the keys then they go through the slow recovery path (maybe get the recovery codes off paper from their safe-deposit box)
[03:47:04] <danieldg> if you never set up a recovery path, that's a problem - but it's a problem you could fix at any point
[03:47:05] <ms7821> yeah, if you've stuff that you can only access through your yubikey, that's a risk and you should probably mitigate it somehow
[03:47:27] <ms7821> your yubikey might just break tomorrow

[17:37:09] <LTCD> ms7821 Why is it insecure to use a PRF as part of a MAC construction?
[17:37:18] <ms7821> is it?
[17:37:45] <tolarz> looks wrong though
[17:38:06] <tolarz> It should be: f_k⁻¹(c) = f⁻¹(c) xor k
[17:38:08] <LTCD> ms7821 Doh, I misread the question, it is secure.
[17:38:17] <tolarz> you would have noticed this in your proof if you actually proved something
[17:38:19] <tolarz> :-)
[17:38:49] <tolarz> If you expand your putative proof, you would need f(f(m xor k) xor k) to simplify to m somehow (under high probability)
[17:39:54] <LTCD> tolarz So it is just the proof that needed expanding?

[17:50:56] <tolarz> LTCD: no just reread my messages please
[17:51:49] <tolarz> i came up with the inverse by imagining diagrams
[17:51:53] <tolarz> of the functions and their actions
[17:51:57] <tolarz> but you can also do it syntactically:
[17:52:02] <LTCD> tolarz https://ibb.co/cCwtVfT
[17:52:04] <tolarz> f_k(c) = f(c xor k)
[17:52:07] <tolarz> apply f⁻¹ on both sides
[17:52:12] <tolarz> f⁻¹(f_k(c)) = c xor k
[17:52:19] <tolarz> apply (- xor k) on both sides
[17:52:38] <tolarz> f⁻¹(f_k(c)) xor k = c
[17:52:41] <tolarz> sorry, c should be m
[17:53:11] <tolarz> LTCD: come on, reread your proof yourself
[17:53:20] <tolarz> LTCD: spotting the new mistake shouldn't be so hard :)
[17:53:22] <ms7821> try expanding your f⁻¹_k(f_k(m)) again
[17:53:42] <LTCD> I missed the -1 in the second Pr?
[17:53:50] <tolarz> and then you missed the whole proof anyway...
[17:53:53] <tolarz> no explanation
[17:53:58] <tolarz> you just write what needs to be proven
[17:57:03] <ms7821> I'm not really sure why there's probability involved tbh, I assume there's some missing context
[17:57:31] <LTCD> Nope, I just made my best guess.
[17:57:57] <tolarz> look up definitions rather than guessing
[17:57:59] <tolarz> :)
[17:58:04] <tolarz> look up what it means to be an inverse
[17:58:57] <LTCD> I think what I have wrote is good enough for a few marks though?
[17:59:13] <LTCD> I mean, I am self studying so can only guess.
[17:59:39] <ms7821> well, I was wondering how it would be 5 points initially, but that's because I misread your answer
[17:59:40] <tolarz> with this attitude you won't learn anything
[17:59:49] <tolarz> also, your answer is wrong anyway

[23:24:03] <EmmyNoether> Juniper Breach Mystery Starts to Clear With New Details on Hackers and U.S. Role
[23:24:38] <Peng> So apparently, back in 2008, Juniper was aware that Dual_EC_DRBG was shady, but used it anyway because the US military wouldn't buy their gear otherwise.
[23:25:26] <Peng> (And then of course Chinese intelligence compromised them and replaced the US backdoor numbers with their own.)
[23:27:03] <aczid> was it proven that it was them?
[23:27:45] <aczid> "Those intruders haven?t yet been publicly identified, and if there were any victims other than Juniper, they haven?t surfaced to date." meh
[23:28:07] <aczid> but yeah great hack hehe
