[00:35:17] <Faux> Probably because the bulk of people programming this kind of thing haven't heard of it yet, as it isn't old enough.
[00:36:08] <Faux> Someone on SO Academia was asking for an postal address for Python-the-language as their reviewer hadn't heard of it and wanted a citation for what it is.

[12:03:02] <TommyC> is it safe to downcast to a derived class if I originally instantiated it as said derived? 
[12:10:01] <Renderwww> if you create an object of class X you can always cast that object to X

[14:05:30] <jotham> GOOD DAY FELLOW PUTLER FANS
[14:08:12] <Renderwww> good reminding to you too
[14:11:20] <Carbonflux> i read a story today that Putler was claiming he is a victim of cancel culture, he even compared himself to J.k. rowling
[14:11:56] <Carbonflux> i guess in a way sanctions are a geopoltical form of canceling.
[14:12:20] <Carbonflux> j,k, rowling got kinda mad about it i guess.
[14:15:07] <MaNI> good on her for smacking down his dumb comparison
[14:15:37] <MaNI> I've seen this idiotic "west is cancelling russia" from the local "I get all my opinions on fox news" crowd and its a really dumb take
[14:17:02] <MaNI> tiny bit of a difference between ending someones entire career over a dubious #metoo tweet/allegation and sanctioning a country because they're literally indisputably invading another country and killing civilians as well
[14:17:47] <jotham> and razing a city
[14:18:35] <MaNI> and lying to the parents of your own soldiers about whether they are dead or not
[14:18:39] <MaNI> and various other things
[14:18:53] <MaNI> just subtle differences you know ;) 
[14:22:04] <Carbonflux> heh ya
[14:23:49] <Svitkona> i am truly SICK of this cancel culture
[14:28:01] <jotham> as the meme goes 'you absolutely do not have to hand it to them' (when it comes to nazis, etc)
[14:28:03] <jotham> but in this case
[14:28:13] <jotham> starting a war with a 5000 word essay was actually fairly classy
[14:28:21] <jotham> imagine if in the west we had literate politicians 
[14:29:09] <jotham> been listening to a lot of conversation between rory stewart (remoaner, tory from the last tory govt in uk) and alister campbell (fixer for tony blair) and it's fairly fascinating how fucked our political systems are
[14:29:29] <jotham> they are both really quite reasonable and intelligent people
[14:29:36] <jotham> but rhetoric wins the day
[14:31:01] <jotham> only reason i bring up the essay is because of yesterdays russian statements about how they have done what they came to do
[14:31:07] <jotham> which is awkwardly obviously incorrect

[20:39:52] <ix> What do you guys like as non-github git forges?
[20:40:10] <jotham> we use gitlab at work and it's pretty nice
[20:40:21] <jotham> for my own i just use gitolite + ssh
[20:45:36] <ix> There's so many...
[20:46:09] <Zogatribe> so you recommend gitlab? any downsides?
[20:46:48] <jotham> paying for subscription software from california is generally a shit idea?
[20:46:59] <jotham> and rent seeking venture capitalist bastards ruin everything that is any good?
[20:47:13] <jotham> but otherwise, works well for us
[20:47:17] <Zogatribe> we currently pay for atlassian but they are changing their licensing model to make it even more expensive
[20:47:24] <jotham> yeah
[20:47:27] <jotham> we use confluence
[20:47:30] <jotham> for all our documentation
[20:47:44] <Zogatribe> so if gitlab is cheaper and also good then it is a viable option
[20:47:56] <jotham> commercial web software is a fucking cancer but we use a lot of it and some of it is okay for some things some of the time for a while
[20:48:16] <jotham> problem is if it's any good some cunt buys it
[20:48:19] <jotham> and changes the licensing
[20:48:28] <jotham> and it becomes worse but you're stuck with it embedded in your org
[20:48:33] <jotham> the whole thing is offensive
[20:49:22] <Zogatribe> we need an off-internet solution due to security requirements and atlassian data server costs lost of monies
[20:49:32] <jotham> yeah
[20:49:57] <jotham> in my country data sovereignty is a big thing too
[20:50:16] <jotham> i.e. don't host customer data on foreign infra or in foreign software stacks
[20:55:21] <ix> I really wanna move away from github, i just don't wanna lose the "github cred", but tbh i think selfhosting a gitea is still the best option
