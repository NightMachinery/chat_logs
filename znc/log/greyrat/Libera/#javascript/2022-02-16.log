[01:32:38] <jellobot> silly, Arrow functions, new in ES2015, are not just shorter function syntax with optional implicit return.

[01:36:41] <hrob> function foo() {...}    I was thinking having same effect as   const foo = () => {...}
[01:36:43] <ljharb> hrob: you can `const f = function foo() {}` just like you can `const f = () => {}`, or `let` with both
[01:36:46] <ljharb> hrob: no, it's not
[01:36:55] <ljharb> hrob: that's a function declaration, which is hoisted, and very different from an arrow.

[01:36:59] <jellobot> hrob, A function declaration `function declared() {}` & a function expression e.g. `var bar = function expressed() {}`: the former is !hoisted, the latter can be immediately invoked (see !iife) and can be anonymous (eg can omit the name "expressed"). "function" as the first word of a statement at global scope or directly inside a function starts a function declaration; otherwise, it starts a function expression.

[02:05:34] <ThePendulum> it looks like you changed your first call to updateSales to createInitialList
[02:06:13] <ThePendulum> so you need to move that click handler over there too
[02:06:41] <ThePendulum> probably need to create a separate function to associate those handlers because I think you would have to re-assign them when running updateSales

[02:09:57] <ThePendulum> that $(".btn.warning").click() stuff
[02:10:22] <ThePendulum> that's what making those buttons work, and you're not running it anymore because you changed updateSales to createInitialList or something like that

[02:42:05] <hrob> does it make sense to await and return result of await within in an async function?   does that not defeat the purpose?
[02:42:37] <jaawerth> doing so is meanlingless
[02:42:52] <jaawerth> since the return value is implicitly wrapped in a promise either way

[09:27:41] <OnkelTem> not following*
[09:27:54] <systemfault> REST is about resource-based API using all the facilities HTTP provides.... (Content negotiation, verbs, discoverability, etc) It's fine for an API that is consumed by a machine....
[09:27:59] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@185.217.117.193)
[09:28:38] <systemfault> A website needs to have specific payloads, as small as possible to improve loading times... not too many at the same time because the browsers limits them...
[09:28:59] <systemfault> Also, you cannot do anything but GET or POST using HTML forms...
[09:29:09] <systemfault> Forms don't support JSON...
[09:30:07] <systemfault> For a website, you'll often create very specific endpoints that will fetch all the required data from multiple different resources...

[15:46:33] <p-i-> https://bpa.st/GBYA <-- I have this script for automating the filling out of a dialog on https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT
[15:47:21] <p-i-> Executing it in chrome console and `setTimeout(() => goToDateRange('2022-02-13', '7:03', '2022-02-13', '13:33'), 3000)` and focusing on the window again, it almost works.
[15:47:42] <p-i-> But it's not using the values I injected. It's using the previous values.
[15:48:17] <p-i-> I have `const ev = new Event('input', { bubbles: true });` ... is there another event I should be injecting, like an 'update' event?
[15:48:30] <p-i-> Is there a way to see the set of all events available?

[17:30:40] <fweht> are there any css tricks (sorry if this is off topic) to distinguish between an hidden image which is loaded in the background and an hidden image which is not prefetched?  i want to build an image slider which loads only the images near the current index position...
[17:31:49] <fweht> so e.g. i start at index 0 and want that images 0 is visible, images n-2, n-1, 0, 1, 2 are invisible but loaded in the background and the other images are not loaded

[21:23:48] <austincheney> twiclo, events do not change states.  The DOM nodes executing the events, and any data corresponding to that DOM node, change state though
[21:24:56] <earthToAdam> Why is Request() failing when I call it from a web worker, created from a blob; but works fine when the worker has its own worker.js file?
[21:26:20] <earthToAdam> Here is the main.js file: http://ix.io/3PMx/javascript

[21:27:14] <austincheney> twiclo, I have never used the google maps API so I am not sure what the correct answer is
[21:27:19] <earthToAdam> The error I am getting is Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'Request': Failed to parse URL

[21:31:58] <earthToAdam> Hmmm... so this script spins up a web worker, which requests a video and then passes the arrayBuffer back to the page to get loaded into the DOM. All of this works fine, when the web worker is created from its own worker.js file.
[21:32:25] <earthToAdam> But now I am trying to spin up the same worker as an embedded worker (blob) and it's breaking...
[21:33:21] <earthToAdam> Actually, I'm thinking its because the worker is wrapped inside a blob but the file it's requesting is at the site's root...
