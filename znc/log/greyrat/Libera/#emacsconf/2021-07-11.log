[20:11:14] <hmw> dragestil: Maybe you have and don't know it ;)

[20:15:31] <hmw> For instance, I think about showcasing Org to produce beamer-based slide decks or something about reproducable research at the local LaTeX user group. But time is a scarce resource.

[21:03:08] <zaeph> It is, but it's always a good idea to share those stuff, whatever the medium may be.
[21:03:27] <zaeph> Written articles tend to be the easiest to pull of for those with limited pool to dedicate to such projects.
[21:13:31] <hmw> True. It still takes quite some time to match the expectations of your target audience. I try to kill two birds with one stone (if I get the Org/beamer thing done). First, the LUG is looking for contributions, they have basically nil activity. And second, I think there are still examples needed, how people use Org mode in their day-to-day work.
[21:13:31] <hmw> There is more: every semester I build the infrastructure for the software engineering courses (accounts, git, jenkins, sonarqube, tomcat, etc.) from Org -with the help of a bit of Python-. That might be interesting for others as well. I guess dragestil finds something similar in this toolbox.
[21:15:45] <zaeph> Definitely sounds interesting.  My advice would be to go at it bits by bits, and to eventually collect them under a single blog post Ã  la http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html .
[21:17:56] <hmw> I've started writing about the SE courses around xmas last year. But don't hold your breath waiting for it to be finalised and scp'd to a webserver ;).
[21:18:48] <zaeph> Oh don't worry; if sachac and myself had to hold our respective breaths for every person we've nudged towards writing, we'd have gone blue in the face a while ago. :o)
[21:18:58] <hmw> ;)
[21:19:06] <zaeph> Best of luck with the writing, and do keep in touch if you need some extra nudging or advice.
[21:19:40] <hmw> I can come up with tons of excuses why I'm not finished yet ;)
