[03:30:17] <shapr> just found a bug, I can't apply hlint hints if there's a comment at the end of the line
[03:30:35] <shapr> specifically, I had: biggest items = foldr1 max items -- this line shows two hlint hints, "eta reduce" and "use maximum"
[03:30:46] <shapr> and had to move the comment to the next line for the hint to work
[03:33:52] <shapr> how do I diagnose an error like this? :  LSP :: Failed to apply edits with message Args out of range: #<buffer Examples.hs>, 1266, 1269
[04:47:39] <shapr> Well, more examples added, though hls-class-plugin is giving me edit errors? https://github.com/shapr/hlsexamples/blob/main/src/Examples.hs

[17:08:01] <shapr> jneira[m]: sure! I'll add a bug report
[17:18:26] <shapr> I see bugs like this, but I can't tell if the root problem is emacs or hls
[17:18:43] <shapr> Does anyone know how I can diagnose the cause of a problem between hls and emacs?
[17:18:58] <shapr> hm, I guess I could setup hls inside vim / vscode ?
[17:26:04] <shapr> Since I'm doing a live demo, I might as well setup vscode as a backup in case emacs flakes
