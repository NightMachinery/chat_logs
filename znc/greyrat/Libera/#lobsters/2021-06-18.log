[01:18:51] <dasm> c355e3b: "if a jvm, it needs to die"
[01:19:07] <dasm> tbf, i didn't see jvm environment which wasn't hungry on all resources
[01:19:10] <c355e3b> the jvm is really nice to run things on
[01:19:36] <dasm> maybe this is because developers don't care on resources? or maybe because jvm just eats up everything? idk.

[01:23:24] <edk> sure it does
[01:24:14] <edk> if i have a jvm that's occupying 20G of memory and using 2, the remaining 18 can be swapped if necessary without hurting anything

[01:24:56] <dasm> actually, if you have all the resources lying around, why don't just use it?
[01:25:09] <dasm> if you have 40gb, that would be stupid to use just 20gb and ignore another 20gb

[02:23:03] <JordiGH> I mean, if you think of the tangent plane as being a bunch of vectors... tangent vectors at each point... and you smoothly move those tangent vectors along your manifold, you're going to get a bristly manifold full of vectors at each point, but which are related to each other by the smoothness of the manifold.
[02:24:18] <JordiGH> If you have some sort of differential equation on a manifold (for example, a geodesic, a shortest distance distance on a manifold, defined by a curve whose intrinsic derivative is zero, same way that going "straight" on the Earth means doing a great circle arc, which isn't really straight, but looks straight from the point of view of the Earth)

[02:36:36] <daegalus> hmmm, im so tempted to attempt making my own programming language. Mostly a Go-like language with union types and generics, and a few other things, But I know I won ever make it far or make it worthwhile for others to use
[02:37:28] <daegalus> maybe i should dabble in Crystal or Nim
[02:37:28] <ngoldbaum> have you ever made a new programming language in e.g. a class?
[02:38:42] <daegalus> ya, i have. Took compiler design and made a pet language back then. Also took programming paradigms, and our teacher had us making a new programming languages using different programming paradigms. Like the lexers and such in both Java and haskell, etc.
[02:40:18] <daegalus> i mean, ill need to brush up on modern language design, and all the new techniques, but I am not starting from 0
[02:41:35] <daegalus> but i have musings like this from time to time. I also want to write my own kernel and OS, but thats also something I probably wont succeed at or do, just cause thats another project in the 1000s of unfinished projects i want to start. I also want to make an ActivityPub based alternative to Email, and thats probably never going to happen.
[02:42:03] <ngoldbaum> if you want to make a toy go for it but itâ€™s a big big project to make a real-world useful imperative language as a one-man project
[02:42:22] <ngoldbaum> like anything that needs a standard library to be useful
[02:42:30] <technomancy> one thing I heartily recommend is a compiler that lives on someone else's runtime
[02:42:47] <indigo> There are some awesome languages written like that, such as Fennel
[02:42:50] <technomancy> it's way more useful; you can get a boost from a ton of existing tooling and libraries
[02:43:05] <technomancy> but if you're doing it for the fun of writing a VM, then maybe you don't care about that =)
[02:43:30] <daegalus> Ya, and I wouldn't want to waste my time on a toy language, ive done that before. If I were to make it, i would want i tto be real world useful. So that is stdlib, community, etc.
[02:43:42] <ngoldbaum> (technomancy wrote fennel)
[02:44:05] <indigo> Fennel is considered the best programming language, at least around these parts
[02:44:15] <technomancy> [citation needed]
[02:44:17] <daegalus> nah, I honestly really like go, i just want more things ontop of it that the go community doesnt want or the go developers dont want
[02:44:17] <technomancy> lol
[02:44:37] <ngoldbaum> indigo: only if he rewrites fennel in rust
[02:44:44] <indigo> Heresy!
[02:45:20] <ngoldbaum> does the go compiler support plugins for language extensions?
[02:45:38] <ngoldbaum> like that reddit dude with the unicode hack and a preprocessor to add templates
[02:46:07] <daegalus> technomancy: so for example, writing my own language that compile to another language, or into another runtime/IR, instead of building from scratch, so i can take advantage of all that work done, but have my own syntax, and extra features?
[02:46:13] <doug> maybe twice out of the hundreds of functions i've written in Go i've thought "a generic would be nice there"
[02:46:17] <ngoldbaum> canadian aboriginal syballics ftw
[02:46:42] <daegalus> i dunno, I am writing a pretty hefty go project and generics would have simplified things like 10x
[02:47:01] <indigo> How many errnils does it take to get to the center of the stdlib
[02:47:50] <doug> i have seen generics used in places where there were clearly better design choices
[02:48:00] <doug> i guess we'll see what abuse rolls in next year
[02:48:22] <technomancy> daegalus: yeah. Clojure and Elixir are maybe the most high-profile successes here. I did a survey of all the lisps introduced since Clojure and the majority of them that graduated beyond a toy (double-digit number of contributors) used an existing VM.
[02:48:23] <daegalus> There are a lot of pie in the sky projects that I want to do, but am either unqualified, or don't have the supporting resources to do.
[02:49:26] <daegalus> doug: while I agree, im building an MMO, and the udp, byte packet handler system I am building would benefit so much from generics, over the current interface and type alias based setup that isn't ideal.
[02:50:28] <doug> golang has pretty well established serializers
[02:50:44] <technomancy> the exceptions are Ferret (runs on microcontrollers so a VM is not an option) Carp (also explicitly low-level) and Janet (as far as I can tell chose to write a VM because VMs are fun to hack on)

[02:54:53] <technomancy> not sure how much specific advice I can give here because a lot of it just comes down to luck. a big part of why Fennel has a big community is that it's a really good fit for making games in love2d and tic-80; if it hadn't been for that I think there's no way it would have kept momentum. so leaning hard into a niche was really key there.

I was just going to help modernize it. Unfortunately, before either of us can get a copy of hte server source. He disappeared. We threw our hands up and just kind of forgot about it. 4-5 years later, I was looking at the game again and typed in his name and

His hard drives/tech were all in the dumpster/recycling. So the server code was lost and previous owners of the code deleted their copies as part of it changing ownership. So now I am building the server from scratch.

[19:02:49] <johnhowell> badtuple: I was using push_back() to insert them, I thought maybe I was doing something wrong. Well at least this project is teaching me to use gdb lol I'll have to step through it and see. I print debugged that the code is getting to the creation of a new SDL_Rect and the addition to the list..allegedly
[19:04:10] <badtuple> Any way to print the memory location of the list in both your mutation site and where it's instantiated and see if it's the same?
[19:04:32] <badtuple> Not sure if that's valid (C++ might do weird stuff w/ pointers. not my area, haha)
[19:05:24] <johnhowell> Hmm maybe? I will have to look into that. Admittingly I am rusty and my programming skills are sophmoric on a good day despite completing most of a cs education
[19:07:59] <johnhowell> I've also considered just using Pythons sdl binding, since I'm way more familiar with it due to my job. But I am like.. 95% finished with this project just this last hurdle and it'll be done
[19:10:18] <johnhowell> What I'm doing is during the event loop I am looping over each SDL_Rect in rectangles, and during a right click event I am creating a new SDL_Rect and storing its memory address in rectangles (rectangles.push_back(&new_tile);) but it never seems to actually get into the list, or at least it doesn't draw it
[19:12:25] <bsandro> johnhowell: how do you create SDL_Rect?
[19:12:46] <johnhowell> SDL_Rect rect_name = {x, y, w, h}
[19:13:16] <bsandro> you're making it on stack then, then saving the address
[19:13:33] <bsandro> once the current function/scope closes that address will be invalid
[19:14:04] <johnhowell> Oh, so I should add it to the list near the end of the event loop since the stack should be resolving at that point?
[19:14:21] <bsandro> I would just copy it whole to that list of yours, not just address
[19:14:21] <companion_cube> no, you should push a copy on the vector
[19:14:39] <companion_cube> like bsandro says
[19:15:14] <bsandro> std::list push_back is thread-safe also
[19:16:30] <johnhowell> Copy is a function in std, right? Or do you mean to do something like "copy_new_tile = new_tile"?
[19:17:14] <JordiGH> Sigh, we're going to have to start figuring out how to measure GHG emissions.
[19:17:16] <bsandro> nah just push_back(rect_name)
[19:17:22] <JordiGH> Some of our clients are now asking how to account for them.
[19:17:32] <JordiGH> For cryptocurrencies, sorry, I forgot to say.
[19:17:34] <bsandro> and make list std::list<SDL_Rect>
[19:17:36] <JordiGH> This is really complicated.
[19:17:58] <JordiGH> If you are just making transactions, how should you be responsible for the emissions of the miners?
[19:18:08] <bsandro> compiling with -g -fsanitize=address helps with lots of stuff too
[19:18:31] <geoffwozniak> JordiGH: sounds very much like they want to be able "juke the stats"
[19:18:35] <JordiGH> I think the miners are probably scope 3 emissions for the people using the network without mining...

[19:19:41] <JordiGH> Take all of the output of the miners at the time of the transaction, divide by the number of transactions at the time, and that's your scope 3 emissions for that transaction?
[19:19:57] <johnhowell> bsandro: Hmm, if I just do push_back(rect_name) it gives me an issue about rectangles only wanting pointers to sdl_rects. Refactoring the list to take sdl_rects gives me an error about how it cant convert sdl_rect to const sdl_rect*.
[19:20:38] <bsandro> johnhowell: seems like your list still wants pointers then
[19:20:39] <companion_cube> does SDL take the array of rectangles, or individual rectangles?
[19:21:12] <bsandro> oh wait error goes from using list values somewhere else?
[19:21:14] <companion_cube> you could use `vec<unique_ptr<rectangle>>` I guess
[19:21:30] <johnhowell> companion_cube: invididual rectangles
[19:21:40] <companion_cube> ah, so you can still store them in the list/vec
[19:21:53] <companion_cube> (although with a vec, be careful not to push anything once you give pointers to its content)
[19:22:14] <johnhowell> Yeah so with how it is now (where it does not render the new rectangles) it compiles it just doesn't render the new ones I want to place, I can move the ones I start with predrawn just fine
[19:22:17] <companion_cube> I imagine the pointers are only used for the current frame
[19:23:32] <bsandro> been a while since i've used sdl2 but if some render function wants pointers you can give them straight out of the list
[19:24:17] <bsandro> like SomeSdlFunc(&list.front()) or something

[21:08:28] <aandrew> heh yes I'm about an hour from Toronto
[21:09:14] <manicennui> I've never understood idiots almost coming to a stop as they drive past someone pulled over or an accident so they can see what happened.
[21:09:26] <manicennui> Like slow down, sure.
[21:09:32] <manicennui> But they don't need your help.
[21:09:38] <aandrew> yep it's annoying as hell
[21:10:29] <manicennui> And then like 100 yards after the cop traffic is super fast.
[21:10:29] <indigo> Yep, it's a way of life in LA too
[21:10:39] <carbolymer> bsandro: how do you do that? I'm sleeping 7h/day on average in a week and I'm tired af
[21:10:41] <indigo> Except it's not like it slows traffic down by much since there is always traffic
[21:11:03] <manicennui> It does though. Delays on major highways here are almost always accidents.
[21:11:17] <manicennui> And not accidents blocking the road.
[21:12:01] <manicennui> Not that traffic would be good without the accident, but it drastically increases travel times, even after the road has been completely cleared, as long as there is something going on on the side of the road.
[21:12:13] <ngoldbaum> carbolymer: has anyone ever told you that you snore? you might have sleep apnea and need a cpap

[22:51:18] <geoffwozniak> edk: probably because expressions are array indices
[22:51:18] <imode> welcome to C, where array parameters are pointers and the size doesn't matter.

[23:14:30] <Teckla> "In Go increment and decrement operations canâ€™t be used as expressions, only as statements. Also, only the postfix notation is allowed."
[23:14:34] <imode> fully.
[23:14:41] <imode> ahh yeah.
[23:14:58] <Teckla> Okay, so limited to "safe" usages.  TIL.  :)
[23:15:04] <geoffwozniak> technomancy: there is still this attitude that brevity in source translates to brevity in object code, because C is "close to the metal"
[23:15:52] <gerikson> Perl has it too but Perl is very influenced by C
[23:15:59] <geoffwozniak> So you get stuff like while (len && (c = *p++) && (d = *p++))
[23:16:05] <jasom> geoffwozniak: to be fair, the compilers that shipped with most unixes back in the day were pretty terrible; often just a hacked-up pcc or something
[23:16:30] <geoffwozniak> Yes, and that stopped being true many years ago, but here we are
[23:16:59] <geoffwozniak> C compilers in the 80s were generally crappy
[23:18:09] <Teckla> imode: I'm glad you challenged me on that, otherwise I would have remained blissfully unaware.
[23:18:13] <Teckla> imode: So, thanks.  :)

[23:55:56] <manicennui> I took the week after next off, and I'm just kind of doing the minimum amount of work until then.
[23:56:14] <manicennui> I really should take more than a week.
[23:56:26] <manicennui> I'll actually get an additional day because of the 4th.
