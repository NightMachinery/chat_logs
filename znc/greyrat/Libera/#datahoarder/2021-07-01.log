[23:04:59] <evilgohan2> every stream? Unsure, but you can always fire off youtube-dl
[23:06:21] <duds> of course, i'd just like to make it automatic
[23:08:34] <evilgohan2> I don't know of one. You'll need to probably write your own to monitor the page for when the streamer goes live (but is not hosting someone else). The Twitch API is not exactly conduvie for this tbh
[23:08:39] <evilgohan2> conducive*
[23:08:48] <evilgohan2> Maybe I should write one...

[23:51:51] <ThePendulum> without looking it up, roughly how many people do you think live in Nigeria?
[23:52:37] <duds> 14 million?
[23:53:45] <sarnold> 27M
[23:53:47] <ThePendulum> 200 million
[23:53:53] <sarnold> *wow*
[23:53:55] <duds> goddamn
[23:54:55] <ThePendulum> it's the 7th biggest country in the world and 1/6th of Africa in population
[23:55:46] <ThePendulum> I also didn't know both Pakistan and Indonesia are 5th and 4th
[23:56:22] <ThePendulum> -both
[23:56:59] <ThePendulum> seems Nigeria is at 211,4 million now even
