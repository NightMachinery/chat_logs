[10:23:40] <JollyRgrs> i got an old style lamp (think pixar light thingy) by my 3d printer that i can turn on/off with voice... also auto turns on when i power on the 3d printer (also smart switch)
[10:23:46] <JollyRgrs> nah, i'm def. not smart
[10:23:50] <JollyRgrs> that's why i need smart things around me
[10:25:27] <SirSceptalot> dunno, maybe have a look at more "professionally oriented" DIY stores or something?

[11:06:35] <SirSceptalot> https://nohello.net

[11:08:36] <SirSceptalot> so, how was holiday season for you. You're in lockdown, right? Were you allowed to have family over?
[11:08:58] <lancehead> Yee! I went to my mom on christmas, my dad the day after 
[11:09:05] <lancehead> And friends of my girlfriend on NYE 
[11:09:10] <lancehead> Was fun

[22:29:25] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> fun fact: Comcast will actually give you a routed /60 on a home consumer connection if you set up DHCP-PD for IPv6

[22:29:58] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> yea, no
[22:30:01] <signofzeta> on my old Comcast Business connection, PD gave me a /59.  Not a /56, a /59.  I couldn't get the SonicWall to do anything bigger or smaller, but that was fine.

[22:30:32] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> NAT gives you zero privacy and protection, and pretending/thinking it does is just hurting yourself and others who listen to that school of thought

[22:32:22] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> except make networks more complex and breakable

[22:33:45] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> but regardless, with privacy extensions, the address isn't tied to the MAC address, and with SLAAC there's not even DHCP server logs

[23:12:39] <sd> 14<Kâ€‹illnine> Let me hit up where we got our fortigate (they're closed today). I checked CDW and AVFirewalls and they're both out of all 3 models (we need PoE for some cameras and ipphones until teams is fully converted)
[23:12:50] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> but that's what i see on the IM side

[23:14:23] <sd> 14<Kâ€‹illnine> CDW said they had it in stock until you ordered and got a backordered email ðŸ˜›
[23:14:25] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> which means they're getting far more than the 40% discount
[23:14:32] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> i only get 40% off MSRP
[23:14:36] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> next levels are 50 and 60%
[23:14:41] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> i bet they're at the 60% level and raking in money
[23:14:42] <sd> 02<Hâ€‹unterkll> lol

[23:15:36] <sd> 14<Kâ€‹illnine> I think we have UTM and 24x7 support. I think I was going to do that on a few of these and maybe just buy an extra switch as a hot spare

[23:45:11] <DrZak> a) but we are making hammers ..
[23:46:22] <CoJaBo> Yep. The notable one was the multiple-finger-amputation. You wouldn't expect working with servers to result in loss of appendages, but here we are o_O

[23:55:52] <CableNinja> I almost lost a finger when our full edge enclosure stripped the screw out and fell while I was holding the back and it was being mounted up
[23:56:39] <CableNinja> because of the stupid cage position we had to put a majority of the enclosures parts in before mounting, fucking thing weighed way more than I should've been holding
[23:57:43] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> did you hear about when they stoped testing on mice and used lawyers instead?
[23:58:07] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> this was done for the follwing reason
