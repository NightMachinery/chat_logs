[05:36:18] <MootPoot> its auto generated and its 0% for me
[05:36:31] <MootPoot> so the website is proudly stating that
[05:36:40] <Poeticode> dang, had that happen and I had to contact support to get a new driver. they gave me a $5 credit so i wasn't too upset tho

[05:41:55] <MootPoot> tbh I still dont get the idea of food delivery at the prices presented to us

[05:42:17] <MootPoot> but cars?
[05:43:27] <MootPoot> Poeticode, Sapphirus I have a buddy who once was stuck outside with no car , so he ordered food to his house and tipped the delivery driver an extra 15 bucks to drop  him off too ....AND it worked out cheaper then getting a cab/uber
[05:43:42] <MootPoot> I thought he was bullshitting but then he showed me the recipts
[05:44:08] <Poeticode> damn that's awesome
[05:44:11] <MootPoot> granted, he only saved like 30% but he also got lunch as well on top of that

[10:16:01] <MootPoot> not sure if you can get that in HK
[10:16:06] <MootPoot> since its a westernized indian dish
[10:18:39] <Sadale> I had buns that I purchased from a bakery
[10:18:47] <MootPoot> oppai buns?
[10:19:04] <Sadale> Originally I planned to get bento from fast food restaurant. But it's closed due to a confirmed case of COVID. :(
[10:19:13] <MootPoot> dine in?
[10:19:17] <Sadale> nah. normal buns. bun the food.
[10:19:21] <Sadale> takeout.
[10:19:27] <Sadale> I rarely do dine in
[10:19:31] <MootPoot> why it is closed for takeout then
[10:19:35] <MootPoot> if there was covid
[10:19:51] <Sadale> That restaurant offers dine in as well. But I don't do dine in because I need to fetch the meal for my imouto
[10:19:53] <MootPoot> I can understand dine in but for takeout just sanitize and keep making food
[10:20:19] <Sadale> That's an interesting idea. anyway that isn't how it works here. People are very worried about the virus'
[10:20:41] <Sadale> If there's a confirmed case in the restaurant, you'd close it down for sanitization. Then you reopen it.
[10:21:51] <MootPoot> do you have favorite resturants
[10:21:58] <MootPoot> or do you just go to any random one you see

[10:30:15] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, meh. pub expensive
[10:30:27] <MootPoot> but pub is where you take your imouto to get drunk

[10:56:07] <MootPoot> simpler shows I dont need subs
[10:56:11] <ButterNoodle> anime has a lot of repetitive dialogue

[12:14:44] <ButterNoodle> u mean the overall safety of the gun or the thumb safety?
[12:14:49] <jessedesu_onaph> What is racking the slide meant to do

[12:15:08] <ButterNoodle> ?
[12:15:14] <ButterNoodle> ic
[12:15:20] <jessedesu_onaph> It looks cool when you rack a slide
[12:15:30] <ButterNoodle> racking the slide strips a round from the mag and puts it in the chamber
[12:15:35] <MootPoot> racking a slide just wastes a bullet

[12:26:00] <Bco1981> MootPoot: unless you have a shitton of stuff and settings that your save needs to load, it does not take long... on a ssd.
[12:26:30] <Bco1981> also, motion capture motions take much much longer to load.
[12:26:37] <Bco1981> even on ssd.
[12:27:38] <Bco1981> and yeah, the more shit you have in your save the more unstabil mmd will become.
[12:27:47] <ButterNoodle> can we do mmd henti using real porn starts with motion track?
[12:27:54] <ButterNoodle> that would be poggers
[12:27:57] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[12:28:35] <jessedesu_onaph> Butter you have to be between 15 and 25 to say poggers
[12:28:45] <Bco1981> usually because teen modellers don't fix their shitty models that has 3times bone structure and 4 times physics... that will get you started.
[12:29:30] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: yes, with motion tracking on people doing porn you can do anything in mmd.
[12:29:42] <Bco1981> and if it works in mmd, it works in wss too,
[12:33:43] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I was explicitly saying it takes forever unless you're on a ssd
[12:33:48] <MootPoot> Not the other way around 
[12:34:02] <MootPoot> All of those games are like that 
[12:34:20] <MootPoot> Even in the base game with no mods... If you don't have a ssd get ready to wait 
[12:34:22] <Bco1981> yeah... anything is slow on hdd vs ssd.
[12:34:37] <Bco1981> what game are we talking about then ?
[12:34:39] <MootPoot> Yes, but those games are EXTRA slow 
[12:34:47] <Bco1981> unity games ?
[12:34:51] <MootPoot> Yeah
[12:34:57] <MootPoot> Mostly anything unity on a HDD

[12:35:18] <MootPoot> It's just unity 
[12:36:58] <Bco1981> but the mmd software isn't using unity.

[13:12:27] <amigojapan> Hey Jesse
[13:12:43] <JesseDesu> i was talking about

[13:12:56] <JesseDesu> than koikatsu or whats it called
[13:12:59] <JesseDesu> the porn engine
[13:13:08] <amigojapan> I have 1usd by walking home and also get a workout 
[13:13:24] <Bco1981> ah
[13:13:48] <Bco1981> yeah using shaders, effects and filters will make it look very good.
[13:15:03] <amigojapan> Bco1981: how come vrchat does not require a good GPU? Seems counter intuitive
[13:15:29] <Bco1981> it does if you use vr. has to render the game twice.
[13:16:05] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I used Google cardboard without a GPU 
[13:16:30] <amigojapan> Tho it is a bit choppy
[13:16:41] <Bco1981> then you used a software to connect the phone to the pc ?
[13:16:49] <Bco1981> on the phone.
[13:17:51] <Bco1981> but basically you need a good gpu for all the 3d data that needs to be processed. al the geometry all the vertices, all the shading.
[13:19:06] <Bco1981> the game becomes a lag fest when people make big enviroments and lots of player models running around. and add on top of that some of the models don't follow the recommended limits of "only" 20,000 vertices.
[13:19:53] <Bco1981> some of the mmd models i use, when i load them in blender they say they use more then 100,000 vertices.
[13:20:23] <Bco1981> they have to be reduced so much they lose a lot of detail.
[13:21:28] <MootPoot> vr chat is pretty low on the demand scale anyway
[13:21:38] <MootPoot> amigo plays it at like 20fps or something
[13:21:46] <Bco1981> probably
[13:21:56] <MootPoot> you need to render it twice, and at 90fps or above
[13:22:04] <Bco1981> ^
[13:22:14] <Bco1981> that takes a pretty good gpu.
[13:22:52] <JesseDesu> you want 500fps

[14:12:48] <MootPoot> business laptop gpu from 2015
[14:13:11] <MootPoot> although it has a lot more hardware devices to help it along the way
[14:13:16] <MootPoot> better hardware encoder etc

[14:53:28] <Sadale> like, making it look old
[14:53:34] <ezekielnoob> the basic 'styling' i do to make  it sort of old is
[14:53:38] <ezekielnoob> the blacks are faded a bit
[14:53:45] <ezekielnoob> and also the whites
[14:53:47] <ezekielnoob> and added grains
[14:53:58] <Sadale> interesting.
[14:54:16] <Sadale> I wish the web has less SEO crap. Otherwise I could just look up for tutorial on doing that on my own
[14:58:48] <ezekielnoob> for editing pics?
[14:59:00] <ezekielnoob> Sadale the thing is that the pics were broken.. so i had to salvage it
[14:59:22] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, yep. For editing pics.
[14:59:30] <Sadale> I have no skill on pic editing whatsoever :3
[14:59:52] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, interesting. How could the pics get broken in 21st century?

[15:00:28] <ezekielnoob> Sadale so what happened is that i didn't shoot those pics

[16:43:43] <pokhu> bakatest and haganai too
[16:43:53] <amigojapan> pokhu: if you decide to watch it, watch the original. Not the remake
[16:43:56] <pokhu> i remember watching the second season of haganai, the first episode
[16:44:02] <pokhu> i thought it was very depressing
[16:44:15] <pokhu> because i felt like there were all these people doing things but they werent really doing things
[16:44:45] <pokhu> i mean i accidently watched the second season first episode before the first season first episode by accident

[16:46:46] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I have a few comedies I like

[17:22:51] <darkwitch> maybe they should make it illegal to not own a gun
[17:26:20] <JesseDesu> i have 2 airsoft guns
[17:26:38] <JesseDesu> my M4 doesnt have an orange tip
[17:26:52] <pokhu> i would buy kevlar and a helmet and i would wear it all the time. i would carry guns with me. i have never shot a gun before so i would learn how to shoot a gun, but i used to play fps' so its fine. i would shoot people who are trying to shoot me. i might carry rubber bullets. i might own a taser. i might use the taser, but it seems hard to use.
[17:26:52] <JesseDesu> if someone broke into my house i could scare them off with it
[17:27:30] <JesseDesu> yes i have played a lot of quake1/2/3 tribes and various halflife 1 mods
[17:28:13] <pokhu> if someone came into my house i would give them my money because i am scared of them but i might fight them if i knew combat and they were unarmed but i dont know what they could take from my house. they could take my computer, and i guess that is fine and i might give it to them. i live alone.

[17:35:47] <pokhu> i dont think id like that personally because i dont want to be shot. really im not sure if id like it or not, i meant if i was in charge of the situation i wouldnt choose to pass the law, but maybe in the end things would be more lively, in the same way i used to think it might be entertaining for some type of inescapable war to go on so id get drafted. entertaining isn't the correct word, and again i wouldn't choose to do it if i were g
[17:35:47] <pokhu> iven the option, but i think what was appealing to me was having no options. life is very simple now, and i do not know what to do all day. i do not think getting guns would solve this however, because theyd need to make everybody wear the guns all the time, i think, or else buildings would just stop people at the entrance. really, personally there would be very little change in my life.

[18:28:56] <Bco1981> but we found each other on a danish chat
[18:28:57] <Sadale> Just SO.
[18:29:22] <Sadale> So the kids were produced before marriage? :O
[18:29:30] <Sadale> conceived*
[18:29:39] <Bco1981> yes
[18:29:50] <Sadale> aw
[18:29:51] <Bco1981> just 11 years non married relationship
[18:29:55] <Sadale> It's a taboo doing that here.
[18:30:05] <Sadale> But still some people do that
[18:30:07] <Bco1981> yeah, i know. and sounds like japan too
[18:30:19] <Sadale> And it isn't illegal.
[18:30:24] <Sadale> Raising the kids would be a headache tho
[18:32:24] <Sadale> Bco1981, now that your kid's living with your ex, who's paying for the fee of the kids?
[18:32:41] <Sadale> It takes a financial ruin to raise kids.
[18:32:42] <Bco1981> i do, and she gets state support too
[18:32:52] <Sadale> ah. At least you've got state support there :3
[18:33:05] <Bco1981> yeah.
[18:33:22] <Sadale> Bco1981, Is the state support for kids with single parent, or is that for poor people in general?
[18:33:33] <Sadale> Here we don't have dedicated subsidy for kids with a single parent
[18:33:36] <Bco1981> nah every family gets it
[18:33:55] <Bco1981> but single parents get more
[18:35:44] <Sadale> oh wait wat?
[18:35:52] <Sadale> Bco1981, So every family with kid gets subsidy, or every family even without kids get the subsidy?
[18:36:11] <Bco1981> no, only familys with kids.
[18:36:37] <Bco1981> but a single parent with kids, is a famliy.
[18:38:36] <Sadale> I see :3
[18:39:06] <Sadale> So the definition of a "family" there is the one with at least a kid. Here the definition of a family is two or more people living in the same home
