[20:55:39] <xmb_> i have a general gawk informational question..
[20:56:02] <xmb_> i done code for a dude as always, asks, i do, ..nm.. for the data http://ix.io/3RBG output of nvidia-smi
[20:57:09] <xmb_> i coded this: gawk '$2 ~ /[0-9]/ { if ( p != NR - 1 ) { id = $2; p = NR ; next } } / \/ / { gsub( /[^0-9]+/, "", $11 ) ; gsub( /[^[0-9]+/, "", $9 ) ; $9 = strtonum( $0 ) ; $11 = strtonum( $11 ) ; if ( ( $11 - $9 ) >= 6000 ) res = res id "," } END { print substr( res, 1, length( res ) -1 ) }'
[20:57:31] <xmb_> now my question is, if i omit the strotnum()'s i did there the comparision >= 6000 is completly fail
[20:57:40] <xmb_> why, does it use some weird other number chars in the output or something
[20:58:02] <xmb_> i gsub the MiB away, /[^0-9]+/, "", that makes numbers only
[20:58:18] <xmb_> but the comparision failed completly till i added strtonum() to both values
[20:58:19] <emanuele6> > $9 = strtonum( $0 )
[20:58:30] <emanuele6> are you sure that is correct?
[20:58:31] <xmb_> oh shit
[20:58:33] <xmb_> no
[20:58:43] <xmb_> thank you
[20:58:53] <xmb_> but in case of what i was trying to tell
[20:59:15] <xmb_> it was before the $9 $11 part only $11, and $11 >= 6000 failed competly till strtonum() came
[21:01:13] *** Joins: user51 (~user51@77.126.87.206)
[21:02:11] <xmb_> if you wanna test, this is the case : it prints 2 cases, not 3, the direct $11 no strtonum it doesnt
[21:02:20] <xmb_> curl -sqL http://ix.io/3RBG | gawk 'NR == 10 { gsub( /[^0-9]+/, "", $11 ) ; print $11 ; if ( $11 >= 6000 ) print $11 ; $11 = strtonum( $11 ) ; if ( $11 >= 6000 ) print $11 }'
[21:22:16] <Patsie> I bet a simple $9 = $9+0 (instead of strtonum()) would also work
[21:22:48] <Patsie> if so, then gawk sees the field as a string (of digits) because of the previous gsub/string function let loose on it
[21:23:03] <xmb_> i see, the user reported this without strtonum to work on normal awk without gawk tho 
[21:23:20] <xmb_> i dunno mate, it soudns like a bug
[21:23:35] <Patsie> strtonum() is gawk specific, it's better to use a +0 to convert a string to a number
[21:24:55] <Patsie> I've encoutered this issue myself a couple of times, especially when using all kinds of different functions on the numbers. getline is a famous one for me, when I read in a line. it somehow sees any digits-only field as a string
[21:24:55] <xmb_> ye i agree
[21:25:18] <xmb_> hm buggy'wk
[21:26:40] <Patsie> since you have gawk, you can use the typeof() to check what type gawk consideres the variable
[21:27:05] <xmb_> i see, didnt know
[21:28:36] <Patsie> I just tried your curl example from above on gawk414, 500, 510 and 511 and they all seem to work for both if statements
[21:29:00] <xmb_> hmmm mine didnt work
[21:29:19] <xmb_> curl -sqL http://ix.io/3RBG | gawk 'NR == 10 { gsub( /[^0-9]+/, "", $11 ) ; print $11 ; if ( $11 >= 6000 ) print $11 ; $11 = strtonum( $11 ) ; if ( $11 >= 6000 ) print $11 }'
[21:29:19] <xmb_> 11019
[21:29:19] <xmb_> 11019
[21:29:30] <xmb_> 510
[21:32:01] <Patsie> https://asciinema.org/a/Lk0cvFBeQxHswQbYLCczgEyay
[21:33:18] <Patsie> ohw, there's a thrid print in there
[21:33:21] <Patsie> missed that
[21:33:30] <Patsie> then all of then failed somewhere
[21:33:42] <xmb_> notice, yes
[21:36:26] <Patsie> https://asciinema.org/a/0FQ3Rsy4KWIh1T1UabZlA5TVP
[21:36:39] <Patsie> made the output a bit more clear
[21:36:54] <Patsie> so the first if fails and the if+0 succeeds as expected
[21:37:17] <xmb_> ye, cool mate
[21:37:24] <xmb_> how u ascinema i like
[21:40:33] <Patsie> and as expected -> https://asciinema.org/a/gvE6EzokHJxeCkGsFwhoNzL8K
[21:41:13] <Patsie> eehm, you install asciinema and type 'asciinema rec' to start a recording session
[21:41:15] <xmb_> yea cool mate, i should report the bug in mailing lists somewhen
[21:41:19] <xmb_> thanks
[21:41:23] <Patsie> when you exit it asks you if you want to upload it
[21:41:30] <Patsie> it's not a bug
[21:41:57] <xmb_> i can only see it as bug
[21:42:00] <xmb_> its a number, as is
[21:42:06] <Patsie> just because you don't udnerstand the internals behind the reasoning, doesn't make it a bug ;)
[21:42:16] <Patsie> you use string functions on a field
[21:42:21] <Patsie> that makes it a string for awk
[21:42:32] <Patsie> no matter te contents
[21:42:38] <Patsie> it's just a string of digits then
[21:42:48] <Patsie> if you want a number, do some math on it and it will be a number
[21:43:00] <Patsie> just like +0 makes it an explicit number
[21:43:05] <Patsie> gsub makes it an explicit string
[21:43:52] <xmb_> i got reports that $11 - $9 in awk without gawk as check ( $11 - $9 ) >= 6000 works normally
[21:44:08] <xmb_> i understand the outdated stuff why it has this bug
[21:44:12] <xmb_> they didnt fix it right
[21:44:25] <xmb_> i remind u of the gawk RS not firstly found bug
[21:44:42] <xmb_> on streams no idea of tcpserver in particular it doesnt run when RS is found just way later... or so ...
[21:44:48] <Patsie> call it whatever you want in your world
[21:44:48] <xmb_> they analyzed my bug to this
[21:45:03] <xmb_> they said they have to completly rewrite it, which they wont
[21:45:08] <xmb_> and it was a topic 10 years ago 
[21:45:08] <xmb_> buh
[21:45:10] <Patsie> string/number conversion is not a bug
[21:45:14] <Patsie> its well documented
[21:46:49] <xmb_> you say, tho, in my word, '123' is not a number its a string, and its not a bug
[21:50:42] <emanuele6> i am not sure what we are supposed to see from your example
[21:51:24] <Patsie> that an: if (str > number) fails
[21:51:44] <emanuele6> oh, i see it now
[21:52:13] <emanuele6> that is not specific to gawk
