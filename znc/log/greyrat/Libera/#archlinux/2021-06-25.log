[01:16:23] <Repentinus> Strange.
[01:16:24] <Namarrgon> boot the iso and make sure your disks aren't about to die
[01:17:02] <Repentinus> Yeah, probably worth investigating the state of this system from the live ISO.
[01:17:11] <drew> I have run numerous smartctl scans on them and they always come back with no problems

[01:27:06] <Repentinus> Because if you have not been doing partial upgrades, the disks are good, and you have properly handled pacnews, the number of probable causes is pretty limited. It is possible you have done something dumb like run random installers from the Internet as root, but you don't seem the type. It's also possible that someone has broken into this machine and messed up the system while trying to compromise it further. Of course, you should boot 
[01:27:06] <Repentinus> the live ISO and verify that the disks are still good and check what logs you can and this could be something obscure and improbable…

[01:29:23] <drew> so those could be causing it. I've just never run into problems with systemd segfaulting before
[01:29:47] <Repentinus> These are pretty salient things one ought to have mentioned in the beginning.
[01:29:58] <Repentinus> Try linux or linux-lts.

[01:35:11] <drew> Repentinus: no, that is a very new development
[01:35:38] <Repentinus> So try one of them now. It could be that the systemd issues are related to the mainline kernel.

[13:59:01] <Repentinus> dostoyevsky2, package downgrades are not supported on Arch. You have to build an older version from source against the current versions of any dependencies included in Arch.

[14:02:24] <greyltc> dostoyevsky2: they might burn your house down and delete all your data, but you can find some previous versions of packages on the archlinux archive: https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/

[14:02:25] <phrik> Title: Docker Hub (at hub.docker.com)
[14:03:13] <frostwork> or just download a custom wine and start it outside of $PATH without touching the systemwide installation
[14:03:19] <frostwork> f.e. https://github.com/Kron4ek/Wine-Builds
[14:03:19] <dostoyevsky2> trusch: I use wine in containers only already...
[14:03:40] <trusch> dostoyevsky2: then why its a problem to downgrade the version?
[14:03:52] <dostoyevsky2> so I can have one container with a highly adjusted version of wine, e.g.
[14:04:33] <dostoyevsky2> trusch: I just don't know yet if I could just do it with pacman
[14:05:01] <dostoyevsky2> because the archlinux docker image will always use the latest version of wine

[15:21:43] <mitsuda> like is it possible to have enough privileges to do things like updating packages and preventing nonsense like sudo su
[15:22:12] <grawity> the usual Linux approach is that you have a privileged daemon that exposes an API for exactly the operations you need
[15:22:17] <mpan> mitsuda: yes, working as root. It’s a horrible idea and totally inecure, but security-wise it’s equivalent to what you ask for.
[15:22:47] <grawity> e.g. for package updates, you'd have PackageKit or aptdaemon
[15:22:48] <mpan> If a random user can run pacman without authenticating, they have enough privileges to act as a root.
[15:23:04] <mitsuda> mpan: this is what i feared

[15:26:25] <mitsuda> well
[15:26:27] <grawity> mitsuda: if you don't allow any other arguments (neither --options nor package names) then yes

[15:27:31] <mpan> (now I am operating under the assumption that grawity made, that you mean litearlly ONLY the update operation)
[15:27:40] <mpan> (to make it clear)
[15:27:43] <mitsuda> grawity: is that possible with a sudoers policy?
[15:28:07] <mitsuda> yes only updating, however that may take place

[15:28:43] <mitsuda> i see
[15:29:10] <mpan> One of the pam updates not far ago was enough to lock root out. ;)
[15:29:12] <ayekat> I think "limiting" to -Syu still has potential to break a system, and I would put a system update into the same category as other system plumbing operations, so I'm not sure if such a rule will bring much benefits

[15:30:51] <grawity> which is great if noexec prevents you from just using ProxyCommand to privesc
[15:31:06] <ayekat> haha - so "how to turn ssh into `ls`"
[15:32:19] <grawity> I think I found at least two ways to just *read* files (like the another user's .ssh/id_rsa) not including those
[15:32:30] <mitsuda> mpan: to manage privileges properly in my machine
[15:32:43] <mitsuda> i think just logging as root like you said is best
[15:32:46] <mpan> mitsuda: this is the means to achieve the goal. Not the goal itself.
[15:32:48] <grawity> ayekat: github used to have a "try" website where you could run `git clone`, `git commit` etc. directly through the website
[15:33:12] <mpan> mitsuda: not, it is a HORRIBLE idea to run things as root. And I think I made it clear it’s a sarcasm.
[15:33:13] <grawity> ayekat: turned out, you can ask Git to clone from ext::"sh -c $@>/dev/stderr -- cat /home/trygit/.ssh/id_rsa" as the URL
[15:33:51] <mpan> mitsuda: you should escalate for the specific commands and only for them. But the question is: why the normal way of doing that, which is `sudo`, is not working for you?

[23:11:18] <thorsten`> my personal opinion is that one shouldn't use swap at all: when you run out of memory, then a swapping system just becomes unresponsibly slow, whereas if you don't have swap, then the kernel will most likey kill the actually memory-hungry processes

[23:55:57] <rakyah> Im having some issues with getting Elasticsearch to work with Docker Compose for a Misskey instance. Everytime I try to start the Docker container, it tells me that it doesnt have access to the directory /usr/share/elasticsearch. Ive already tried setting the perms to 777 and chown'ing to 1000:1000, but nothing works. Here is a screenshot of the log: https://i.imgur.com/CRu7DA2.png
