[00:05:37] <f8vv5t2n0x[m]> hello
[00:08:42] <MacGyver> int-e: That *sounds* like you could attack 256-bit AES with a 512-bit quantum machine to completely break it, that's not right is it?
[00:09:54] <int-e> I'm not sure why it sounds like that; in any case, no.
[00:10:25] <MacGyver> Oh, wait, N as in having some number of quantum machines.
[00:10:26] <danieldg> MacGyver: you need more qbits than that, and it'll take you 2^128 time
[00:12:40] <onelegend> is there such thing as a 512 bit quantum machine theoretically?
[00:13:42] <onelegend> also if humans were able to reach that value, we could theoretically use a larger key no?
[00:14:50] <danieldg> onelegend: it doesn't matter how many qbits you have if you need 2^128 time to run - you'll need to find a new star to power the computer
[00:15:34] <onelegend> ah

[03:07:41] <caveman> <TimMc> If someone wants to design a group protocol, they can hack it up by using a distribution account -- everyone sends messages to one person, that person publishes the messages.   <---  i was thinking to do it like that, except to include the possibility to have N many people as the broadcasters (they will function like mailing lists).  i.e. i send each message N times to the N broadcasters,
[03:07:44] <caveman> and the receivers wait for N messages to test if any broadcaster silently dropped the message.
[03:11:18] *** Joins: byteskeptical (~amnesia@user/byteskeptical)
[03:21:33] <caveman> but now i started to think if we can make it even better:  e.g. let T be the total number of relays in the network.  for every message, the sender randomly picks N many relays among those T, and sends his messages through them.
[03:23:21] <caveman> so, what makes a "chatroom" a chatroom?  basically, a random string that's long enough to be globally unique.  the user interfaces of people group messages that have the same random string together in a chatroom-like u.i..
[03:27:32] <caveman> receivers then send their 'received' acknowledgements to everyone in the chatroom via the same method.  e.g. they checksum the message, send its checksum in a special message type "ack".
[03:29:27] <caveman> this way, chatters will be able to cross-validate from each other too.  e.g. a chatter may hear an ack to a message that he didn't get.  then he will know that some server didn't sen him, or maybe sender chose to ignore him at a deeper level.

[03:35:26] *** Joins: Wulf4 (~Wulf@user/wulf)
[03:35:42] <caveman> but how can a person join a chatroom that he doesn't know who is in?  if he sends a message to the unique random string of the chatroom, it would be silly for the network to relay it to everyone (won't scale).  so, one way might be:  the person messages some people in that chatroom with that globally unique random string, then those people will reply back with addresses of chatters they have found
[03:35:45] <caveman> so far.
[03:36:16] * caveman is just thinking loudly.  i think there are issues or better ways to do it.
[03:36:28] <caveman> but i feel it's doable.
[03:36:38] <danieldg> caveman: distributed directory tables are a thing
[03:37:40] <caveman> any name of a decent algorithm?

[03:45:23] <caveman> does it mean that the T many relays have to store list of chatters in chatrooms?
[03:48:55] <danieldg> that's one way to do it, yes
[03:49:11] <danieldg> or they store the messages themselves and the chatters pick them up

[03:52:18] <caveman> will a chatroom's nicklist be stored on the same set of servers?  
[03:54:02] <danieldg> do you need a nicklist?
[03:54:41] <danieldg> or rather, why is that any different than any other room content?
[04:02:48] <TimMc> caveman: I mean, there are a lot of ways to detect dropped messages. I haven't looked into it myself, but I'd start by taking a look at Matrix's protocol.
[04:03:24] <TimMc> It's designed for distributed state convergence, and isn't even specific to chat.
[04:03:31] <TimMc> ...but that's about all I know
[04:03:44] <caveman> danieldg: i am thinking, if we give nicklists to chatters, then they will have the liberty to pick N many random relays among the available T for every message they send.  also thinking that if we go the other approach: let chatters pick their messages, then all chatters will be picking the messages from the same servers that are determined by the hash of the chatroom, hence less relay shuffling.
[04:03:46] <TimMc> Oh, and it's difficult to implement with good performance, apparently. -.-

[18:59:05] <TimMc> Very fittnig, given rasengan's interest in ~*~ blockchains ~*~
[18:59:19] <onelegend> ye
[18:59:30] <rqsd> Man, he sure is living in your heads rent free, isn't he
[19:00:44] <int-e> Eh it's improving. I have enough spare room to also be upset about MS Windows 11's "innovations" :-P
[19:00:59] <TimMc> rqsd: Not exactly. I'm getting some enjoyment from the drama.
[19:01:29] <TimMc> That counts as rent, right?
[19:01:55] <rqsd> int-e: I bought a TPM for cryptographic applications a while ago, ended up finding it too slow for anything I wanted to use it for, while also simultaneously several times more complex in practice than I'd feared
[19:02:52] <int-e> I just learned that they invented tiling WMs and bus mastering DMA :P
[19:08:02] <onelegend> what are TPMs good for anyways?

[19:10:48] <Wulf> onelegend: securely store private keys and secure boot
[19:10:55] <int-e> vendor lockin and drm
[19:11:04] <MacGyver> onelegend: Basically, to ensure a cryptographic key is bound to a machine. If you do cryptographic operations on the CPU using a key in RAM, there's effectively nothing preventing the machine from just spitting the key itself out.
[19:12:18] <onelegend> MacGyver: doesn't the CPU have direct access to the TPM?
[19:12:23] <MacGyver> onelegend: The TPM can do some of the very basic operations that require the key, so that the CPU can say to the TPM "do this operation for me, but never tell me the key".
[19:12:24] <rqsd> onelegend: You get static, unique, unmodifiable identities for each computer; you have a cryptographic coprocessor that can be presumed trusted (unlike the software that may be modified); you get a crude and somewhat slow HSM; you get a supplement for your OS CSPRNG seeding
[19:12:45] <MacGyver> onelegend: "Direct access" does not mean "it can get the keys from it".
[19:29:14] <onelegend> ah
[19:32:28] <Wulf> TPM like all HSMs or "secure module" is a black box with which you can communicate via some wire and send commands like "please sign this value". Ideally there are no commands like "download key"

[20:06:22] <onelegend> is there a FOSS hardware TPM?

[20:12:41] <onelegend> I'm using a software TPM

[21:14:10] <onelegend> hardware auth devices are weird
[21:14:54] <onelegend> much rather just get an encrypted usb flash key from apricorn and store some paper keys on it
[21:16:56] <yawkat> you probably cant get fido certified with a virtual implementation
[21:17:35] <onelegend> ah that's fine
[21:17:39] <onelegend> just something to muck around with
[21:17:52] <onelegend> for example 2FA on some online account
[21:18:11] <yawkat> well if they wont accept clients that arent fido certified...
[21:18:38] <onelegend> how would they know?
[21:18:49] <yawkat> the certs?
[21:18:57] <onelegend> idk
[21:19:05] <onelegend> maybe im wrong
[21:19:51] <yawkat> would be a pretty pointless standard without hardware attestation

[22:35:20] <onelegend> BB84 sounds pretty cool
[22:35:58] <onelegend> I wonder how the fiber optic transmissions would be signed tho
[22:36:39] <onelegend> or is it resistant to MITM attacks by design?
[22:37:07] <onelegend> ISPs should really offer a quantum channel
[22:37:57] <Wulf> until it's available, use crypto ;-)
