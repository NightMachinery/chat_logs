[05:53:32] <grym> there are other ways to tell emacs what your python is; you can do it easily in org if that's your jam 
[05:54:04] <grym> but i almost always have project_dir/stuff and plopping an .envrc there that says "hey, use THIS one" is easy enough

[14:50:23] <kenran> krux02: I'm not sure I understand that. where is the difference? (It might simply be a language barrier issue for me though)
[14:50:58] <krux02> text alignment is when you have several columns of text, for example in a table
[14:51:41] <krux02> and then there is indentation, that is the whitespace at the beginning of a line in programming languages
[14:51:48] <krux02> two very different things
[14:51:53] <krux02> not very differnt
[14:52:09] <gnoo> you can try M-x debug-on-entry untabify to see if something is calling untabify
[14:52:21] <kenran> I actually don't know whether that's what tabs "are for", or whether that's a microsoft word thing. I've just never used tabs :D
[14:52:37] <krux02> gnoo, that is a good thing, yes

[14:53:06] <kenran> for me, M-x indent-tabs-mode actually made TAB inserts spaces, too, but after I pressed C-i once to insert one, even TAB started inserting real tabs again
[14:53:44] <kenran> corwin: yeah that's what I thought. It's not actually useful to try tabs to align columns (when the contents of the "cells" are of different lengths)
[14:54:13] <corwin> tag stops a "word processer" thing more than a text editor thing I think, but it could be done I suspect.

[14:55:17] <corwin> I think it has to be actually col 0 but I'd have to check sources
[14:55:26] <krux02> corwin, yes I will sare it, but I was really hoping that in a 30+ years old editor this would have been figured out by now
[14:55:45] <krux02> I hate wasting my time on this tabs vs spaces question.
[14:55:59] <corwin> probably: (looking-at "^[ ]+") or something like this
[14:56:10] <kenran> krux02: in Emacs, there's org mode and I use that to have ascii tables if I really want "columns"
[14:56:10] <edgar-rft> krux02: I agree that the emacs tabs-vs-spaces behaviour is super-weird and there are *several* variables that control *when* tabs are replaced by spaces. If I remember right then they are explained in the Emacs Manual "Indentation" chapter.
[14:56:12] <gnoo> isn't the default to use both tabs and spaces to get it to align similarly to previous line?
[14:56:23] <krux02> the codebase I am working with uses tabs reasonably, but emacs doesn't understand and breaks everything
[14:56:53] <krux02> I am now siding with the people who abandon tabs alltogether because of problems like this.
[14:57:19] <corwin> I think word processers usually save the tab stop positions as meta-data in theor bespoke formats and then just leave a single tab here are there in the text as needed.
[14:57:25] <kenran> Hum, I've never had this, but I feel like (even reasonably) mixed tabs and spaces won't work well without manual adjustments in most editors

[14:58:15] <kenran> Is this (more) common in older languages?
[14:58:33] <corwin> tab stops aren't likely to be that great for aligning text sans a bespoke file format because their whole point is actually to allow each viwer of the document to do as we wish (how many spaces do I want to see in place of this tab?)

[15:00:12] <krux02> corwin, spaces arn't great for aligning text either, because spaces have a fixed size, letters might have variable sizes that are not an integer multiple of spaces. Using spaces for alignment only works if everybody uses monospace fonts.
[15:00:48] <krux02> with properly working tabs, you could have alignment working with non monospace fonts as well
[15:00:59] <krux02> and not every programmer would be forced to use monospace fonts.

[15:02:27] <corwin> krux02: quite right.  there's been some recent discussions of this on emacs-devel toward allowing mode-line to use variable pitch fonts
[15:03:04] <twrk> would be cool to find a M-x cycle-next-font

[23:38:14] <subopt> Looking for a mode that will let me markup (colorize, italicize, underline, etc) chunks in files of arbitrary text (log files in this case); save them with the markup; and export them to some file type that will allow my non-emacsian coworkers can easily view the markup in a Linux env. Markdown was my first idea, but i don't think it'll will work w.r.t. others viewing the markup (our Linux was EOL'ed by RedHat a
[23:38:15] <subopt>  few years back, and we're not getting a new one soon). Any ideas?

[23:45:52] <natrys> subopt: you don't necessarily need emacs for export, e.g. you can use a program called pandoc for conversion, there are probably many other ones
[23:45:55] <kilobug> subopt: if a readonly version is fine enough for coworkers (so, export will do) you can always use an external program for the export

[23:49:21] <corwin> subopt: I'd use org-mode.  Probably, I'd automate using shell scripting to wrap the various bits up into an org-mode document then use org-export via an emacs --batch call from the shell script to generate PDF, HTML, etc. from the "compiled" document.
[23:49:24] <subopt> would prefer to export via emacs. building/installing anything in $HOME here is always a stroll down the Highway to Dependency Hell; and IT won't install anything for us. I'll see what pandoc needs though. Might just need a few libs.

[23:51:51] <corwin> If the person generating the static but nicely formatted versions already has emacs I'm not sure what pandoc would be for.  Using org-mode gives a md on steroids experience (e.g. solves for the where to store the extra markup/formatting)

[23:53:08] <johnjay> like, having something builtin to emacs seems inherently better since then you don't have dependency hell or in this case support hell
[23:53:32] <rpav> pandoc is dead?
[23:53:39] <grym> pandoc is a static binary, sure; it does need texlive to do anything good, though

[23:54:01] <rpav> definitely looks like it's getting commits
