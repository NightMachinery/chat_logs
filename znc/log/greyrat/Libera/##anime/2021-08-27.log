[01:10:31] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, because why pay for them for the rest of their lives? Imo it's not justice either way, it's vengeance. You either torture someone the rest of their life by slowly driving them mad, or you kill them

[01:11:41] <ButterNoodle> hell in europe just deport the murders across the border
[01:11:53] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, youcant rehabilitate a serial killer
[01:12:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: Yes. That is an issue.
[01:12:02] <lastonestanding> so, republic does not equal democracy?
[01:12:14] <Cryowolf> or a serial rapist
[01:12:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: At that point however one wonders why they can't live a relatively normal life... isolated but with network access.
[01:12:33] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: you cant rehabilitate violent criminally insane mass murders etc..
[01:12:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At least until they do something to justify cutting them off entirely.
[01:12:55] <Cryowolf> you can rehabilitate someone that commits like regular crime
[01:13:01] <Cryowolf> who fell in with a bad crowd
[01:13:01] <ButterNoodle> I mean you can lock them in the rubber room so they are just a risk to themselves and the caretakers our tax dollars pay for
[01:13:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: If they could access the outside, they could also do some remote work. This could be used for buying things on the inside, subject to veto.
[01:13:47] <lastonestanding> aren't all murderers mentally ill?
[01:14:02] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: not all... governments arent mentally ill
[01:14:10] <ButterNoodle> or are they..
[01:14:19] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, what do you mean network access? So they can convince some crazy fanatic thats crazy in love with them or something
[01:14:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hypothetical: Someone who murders all of those involved in say... the rape & murder of their sister, are they ill, or are they perfectly reasonable?
[01:14:25] <lastonestanding> governments don't kill, soldiers do
[01:14:25] <Cryowolf> or worships them
[01:14:29] <Cryowolf> thenget them to kill
[01:14:29] <ButterNoodle> on a serious note.. it depends on the subject matter
[01:14:33] <lastonestanding> or agents
[01:14:49] <Cryowolf> well now Im pushing up my bedtime
[01:14:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I would tend toward saying reasonable, and yet that technically qualifies as serial murder.
[01:14:50] <ButterNoodle> agents.. of the government
[01:14:57] <ButterNoodle> *just following orders
[01:15:03] <lastonestanding> chain of command?
[01:15:08] <ButterNoodle> yes
[01:15:15] <lastonestanding> seek and destroy
[01:15:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Chain of command is mostly an excuse.
[01:15:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "It's okay to murder if we tell you to, but it ain't if you see the need for yourself."
[01:15:38] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: good song off of kill em all
[01:15:55] <ButterNoodle> anyway
[01:16:25] <ButterNoodle> cold blooded murders are not rehabilitate-able
[01:17:33] <ButterNoodle> there is a gray area I guess... I dont like the thought of people that are victims of their circumstances.. born poor in violence..
[01:17:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Re-read my hypothetical. That would require planning.
[01:17:55] <lastonestanding> maybe there are individuals who can be rehabilitated 
[01:18:56] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: even in that hypothetical, the temporarily insane argument would hold up in a jury of peers - idk if I would call it reasonable from my own objective
[01:19:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If the culprits aren't identified for a while, it's an issue.

[01:19:53] <ButterNoodle> I would personally act in that situation, however hypocritically I would want someone to "trust the criminal justice system" instead of getting blood on their hands
[01:20:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Personally I think they should've been drawn & quartered.
[01:20:24] <ButterNoodle> I already know that one.. very egregious act of violence and malice
[01:21:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's nearly as egregious that no one saw fit to correct the court's lack of judgement.
[01:21:37] <ButterNoodle> I would take them apart piece by piece if that was my child/sibling - and would gladly meet the noose for exacting "justice"
[01:22:51] <ButterNoodle> that whole "minor" thing should only apply to human acts of crime - no human by definition should be able to do that
[01:23:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Being a minor shouldn't be an excuse in general. A 12yo that repeatedly stabs another knows exactly what they're doing.

[01:56:03] <theholyduck> i think my point is. making a big glopping sound is hardly the worst porn
[01:57:01] <emmeka> theholyduck have you actually read it, though. it's fairly atrocious. it's worse than some of the most poorly written slashfics I've seen, and it was actually written by the author - albeit, written by him as an unedited webnovel chapter he wrote when he was young and a nobody, but still
[01:57:18] <emmeka> poor Reki just wants to pretend now that it never ever happened... but the internet won't forget
[01:57:35] <theholyduck> i dunno if i read it all but i think i read the highlight
[01:58:26] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose the voice actors from SAO Abridged actually did a thing where they did a reading of chapter 16.5 (the really bad sex scene we're talking about)

[02:01:29] <theholyduck> emmeka: i mean one of the many issues SAO has is its how it was like very obviously written by 2 "different" people 
[02:01:35] <theholyduck> like 10 years appart
[02:02:52] <emmeka> later SAO stuff is markedly better than some of the original, early stories because yeah, it was the first thing he wrote, ever. He wrote SAO, submitted it to a novel contest in like 2001, failed, and then kept writing webnovel stuff forever until he tried again many year later with Accel World.
[02:03:25] <emmeka> you can easily tell the difference between stuff he wrote in webnovel times and that was then edited into shape, and the later stuff
[02:03:41] <theholyduck> sure but its also why the anime is soo. derpy with the first half thing. 
[02:04:02] <theholyduck> like all those in between stories between the start of the everyone is trapped stories. 
[02:04:12] <emmeka> nah. that's the best they could've done.
[02:04:22] <theholyduck> sure it is the best they could have done
[02:04:37] <theholyduck> but its like all the "he meets some girl. and changes their life and they disapear or die 
[02:04:41] <theholyduck> repeat
[02:04:59] <theholyduck> it like really doesnt fit at all with the end of that first arc
[02:05:07] <emmeka> SAO Vol 1 is literally basically just the tail end of the Aincrad story, from the part where Kirito catches that rabbit until the end of the game. All other parts of it are from short stories anthologies which he published as Vol 2 and 8
[02:05:35] <emmeka> episode 2 was from a new story written explicitly to make an anime, that later became SAO Progressive, but didn't exist in print at the time the anime aired.
[02:06:21] <emmeka> theholyduck so the anime just adapts the content in chronological order, it takes the short stories and puts them in order in the timeline and then goes from there right into the main story of Vol 1
[02:06:53] <emmeka> it seems repetitive when done this way, but the novels didn't really go like this so it's k

[02:08:32] <Berlin36_> "this conversation is protected by irish to irish encryption" ^
[02:08:41] <emmeka> theholyduck also thing which makes me eternally mad: in Vol 8 there's a short story called The First Day. It tells what happened to Kirito inbetween him parting with Klein and meeting Asuna, and in my opinion, it's absolutely essential to his characterization
[02:08:47] <emmeka> but they never animated it
[02:09:19] <AmalLight> mm
[02:09:26] <emmeka> the murder case short story gets 2 whole episodes, but that one? no

[02:10:26] <AmalLight> i am searching
[02:10:30] <AmalLight> never seen
[02:10:30] <emmeka> uhhh
[02:10:51] <AmalLight> oh yesSword Art Online
[02:10:56] <AmalLight> oh yes Sword Art Online
[02:11:08] <AmalLight> never listened as SAO
[02:11:23] <AmalLight> but i think it was pretty
[02:11:30] <theholyduck> emmeka:  :P ive been watching the biden press conference as we have been talking about this
[02:11:33] <theholyduck> and its been pretty good
[02:11:50] <AmalLight> i like more the anime about Oz virtual world , summer war
[02:11:58] <AmalLight> i like more it emmeka
[02:12:40] <AmalLight> some times i thought SAO was exaggerated
[02:13:12] <AmalLight> ( but is only my opinion , so don't be angry ) 
[02:13:38] <theholyduck> im thankful for sao. for no other reason that i dont think there would have been a konosuba anime
[02:13:39] <theholyduck> without SAO
[02:15:03] <emmeka> I think SAO has been made out to be like ~the worst anime ever~ because it's a thing that noobs watch and think is good in contrast to [insert pet less popular series here], but it's nowhere near as bad as people like to pretend it is.
[02:15:07] <ButterNoodle> holy shit

[07:33:50] <Nanobot> Vtubers are animated mascot characters that have become trendy with young teenagers. They compete in games like Mario Kart and Minecraft while receiving millions of dollars in donations. However, these donations don't go to charity; they go to a foreign company called Hololive, which creates and animates the characters. Their popular characters include a murderous rabbit, a foul-mouthed erotic dancer, and a child dressed in a shark costume (a play on 
[07:33:50] <Nanobot> "child predator") who attracts over 3 million regular viewers.
[07:33:53] <omero> I understand Aurora_v_kosmose ... its policies...

[08:20:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Possible
[08:20:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Parts needing maintenance probably never receive it.
[08:20:38] <ButterNoodle> they get clogged up.. irreparably

[09:28:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Basically a USB drive that if you plug USB-side, you can only read from it. If you want to change what's on it, or reflash its firmware, you have to use serial pins on the other side.
[09:29:45] <amigojapan> I see Aurora_v_kosmose 
[09:30:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically making it impossible to disable its protection accidentally via a switch. You'd have to reflash it with RW firmware instead of RO firmware.

[10:45:17] <MootPoot> how tf do I color code my WSL 2 debian terminal
[10:45:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I strongly suspect the WSL part you hadn't previously mentioned is a significant part of the issues you're having.
[10:45:47] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  yeah, but that's a cosmetic thing at best, it dosen't actually do anything meaningful
[10:46:09] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: you can remove the window manager on any linux and still run in commandline
[10:46:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: Indeed.
[10:46:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Assuming the admin didn't disable TTYs anyway, but why bother.
[10:47:00] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you have too low understanding of computers to be discussing this if you think an alternative GUI is just cosmetic
[10:47:12] <MootPoot> I mean, isen't that how linux is setup
[10:47:32] <MootPoot> you can get a distro with 3-4 different GUIs since all they do is just hook into the terminal at some point
[10:47:43] <MootPoot> If that isen't cosmetic idk what is
[10:47:46] <DaPinkOne> a window manager isn't the same thing as a gui
[10:48:08] <amigojapan> No those are desktop environments, that is not what I am taking about MootPoot 
[10:48:08] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:48:09] <MootPoot> really
[10:48:17] <MootPoot> oh okay amigojapan 
[10:48:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That's part of the misunderstanding you're having. They're not drawing shapes and glyphs on your terminal. They're sending drawing commands and bitmaps to the display server which manages a framebuffer that is then fed to your graphical output hardware.
[10:49:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Window managers manage how windows are displayed in that framebuffer.
[10:49:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Desktop environments are software groupings that include a window manager and a bunch of common conveniences and "niceties" for users, such as calculator programs, email, etc..
[10:50:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Linux maintains different inputs for the framebuffer, and the TTYs use a separate mode that draws differently without interacting with the display server.
[10:50:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's also why if you modify your display server config and manage to crash it such that it cannot restart, you can still go and fix it from the TTYs.
[10:51:39] <MootPoot> So in all of this where is the GUI that amigo speaks of
[10:52:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Running atop the window manager. It's individual programs that spawn rectangles of content in it.
[10:53:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The window manager itself also manages a bit of how they're displayed, so their borders can differ based on it.
[10:53:32] <MootPoot> terminal -> display server -> Window manager -> gui
[10:53:35] <MootPoot> ?
[10:53:50] <amigojapan> MootPoot: if you have an underlying command user interface, you can also avoid using a GUI altogether
[10:54:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Linux Kernel -> Framebuffer -> Display Server ->  Display/Login Manager -> Window Manager -> GUI Stuff 
[10:54:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: command line interface, then GUI then window manager then applications
[10:54:57] <MootPoot> So if the GUI runs on the window manager, that makes the GUI dependant on the window manager
[10:55:02] <MootPoot> is that correct?
[10:55:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, it's more Framebuffer <-> Linux Kernel but it gets fussy at that point because it's partly the hardware.

[10:55:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Not quite, using different programs atop the window manager can provide different GUIs too
[10:55:30] <Bco1981> If Windows 10 can’t boot at all, the command line interface (CLI) is the only option you have.
[10:55:45] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I am calling xorg a GUI
[10:56:08] <amigojapan> I think there is much miscommunication going on now
[10:56:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The programs usually use different graphical toolkit frameworks for determining how to send their content to xorg. This is what generally consists of themes & such.
[10:56:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The configs for those frameworks.
[10:57:11] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I am saying that Linux gives you the option of not using xorg and using a different program
[10:57:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Ah well yes, you can use a different display server. Like wayland and Arcan
[10:57:49] <amigojapan> Yup
[10:58:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Gnome programs on wayland or on Xorg look the same though (assuming same theming config)
[10:58:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (readers: Gnome is one of the graphical toolkit frameworks I mentioned)

[11:00:24] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah but I am thinking more of the days when you could choose to run Windows or gem in top of DOS
[11:01:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, in that case it's basically running your display server atop your terminal instead of your init program.
[11:01:15] <Bco1981> like back with windows 3.1
[11:01:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mostly because Windows is organized a bit different.
[11:01:28] <amigojapan> Right Aurora_v_kosmose that was the good way
[11:01:43] <Bco1981> actually windows 98se was still like that
[11:02:12] <Bco1981> they even had a dos v7.10 in windows 98
[11:03:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Personally I prefer the Linux way, but in truth I most prefer the notion of handling everything to isolated containers atop a separation hypervisor that does nothing more than mapping memory, interrupt remaps, PCI & IOMMU, and other such essentials.
[11:04:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh and managing secure communication between containers that should be communicating by default or as allowed by the user.
[11:04:11] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I think MootPoot lacks experience with those things and that is why he is so confused
[11:04:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So basically the hypervisor/microkernel model.

[11:10:53] <isekaijin> Is it worth moving from X.org to Wayland?
[11:11:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: Debatably. It fixes some of Xorg's idiocy, but on the other hand it implement brand new idiocy of its own.

[11:31:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The notion of landownership prices and tuition as an evolutionary challenge is a bit odd.
[11:31:42] <amigojapan> Right

[11:33:17] <amigojapan> I guess the human way is better than going into battle
[11:33:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah but it's a bit different, coexistence occurs to a large degree.
[11:33:45] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, I'm pretty sure the human way is mostly battle

[11:49:40] <mathu> the set of jobs i can do full remote is significantly smaller than the set of jobs i can do in the office. i depend on ambient productivity for a lot of things

[12:06:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Shove in microwave for 2~5 minutes and that's it. Meal.
[12:07:10] <DaPinkOne> besides the point though, there's probably still prep you do which you wouldn't if you weren't leaving
[12:07:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That was my point. It's a minimum of 1h20m of my life wasted.
[12:07:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unpaid.
[12:07:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah, I misunderstood your addition.
[12:07:58] <DaPinkOne> since i've had a choice, i've tried to keep my commute sub 30 minutes
[12:08:15] <DaPinkOne> I've lived in some shitty neighborhoods though, for the convenience
[12:08:32] <DaPinkOne> the rent here is fucking absurd
[12:08:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DaPinkOne: Here that means rents that would probably justify marrying someone just to get tax cuts and divorcing when you change jobs and move again.
[12:08:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because single-wage rents so close to downtown are uh... not affordable.
[12:09:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not really a thing.
[12:09:07] <DaPinkOne> live near "downtown", can confirm
[12:09:39] <DaPinkOne> well, "near" and "downtown" being subjective
[12:09:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> 30 minutes is near.
[12:09:53] <DaPinkOne> it's still almost two hours to seattle
[12:10:52] <DaPinkOne> hella expensive rent though
[12:11:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So yeah, the commute is unpaid and the rent increase for a shorter commute definitely isn't covered either.
[12:11:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (They'd need to double or triple my wage)
[12:12:18] <DaPinkOne> after college if I can get a place for cheap, like on the other side of the mountains, or further southeast in the country, that'd be nice
[12:12:37] <DaPinkOne> remote work would be a requirement for that to be possible though
[12:13:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yep
[12:13:23] <DaPinkOne> buy some place for like 20k in the middle of nowhere

[16:37:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 2 months is not enough
[16:37:32] <MootPoot> For example take a screenshot and copy it is a 3 key combo rather then 1 button like on windows

[16:41:30] <Bco1981> windows search is kinda amazing... how bad they could screw it up
[16:41:35] <MootPoot> But supposedly they fixed it in win11
[16:41:42] <MootPoot> Based on the videos I've seen

[16:42:02] <MootPoot> Windows search was pretty good for XP and 7
[16:42:07] <MootPoot> They fucked it up with 8 and 10
[16:42:42] <amigojapan> MootPoot: search needs to be indexed. Otherwise it takes forever
[16:43:13] <Bco1981> it's not the speed, it just can't find anything
[16:43:14] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Mac find everything instantly
[16:43:31] <MootPoot> I think the windows 10 search does index it, but they throw stupid crap in there like web search and m$ app store search as well that breaks it 
[16:43:38] <amigojapan> Bco1981: the speed is also a problem
[16:43:45] <MootPoot> Yeah, I've stopped using windows search for most things 
[16:43:48] <Bco1981> the search feature in beat saber is the same... i can't figure out how that works... it's like, it just doesn't
[16:44:08] <Bco1981> amigojapan: speed problem is only if you have a hdd, and not a ssd
[16:44:11] <MootPoot> For a file search I use everything, but for searching windows settings the windows search is ok for that

[16:44:50] <MootPoot> Windows 11 is supposedly going to utilize multicore and ram much more aggressively
[16:45:00] <MootPoot> Spread out the load and cache more stuff 
[16:45:08] <Bco1981> yeah
[16:45:44] <amigojapan> I wonder if I will be able to install it. Cause of the mtp thing
[16:45:53] <MootPoot> mtp?
[16:46:00] <MootPoot> TPM?
[16:46:01] <Bco1981> i hear they have made some features to utilize the big/small core in the 12th gen intel cpu's that are coming
[16:46:23] <amigojapan> What's it called again what it requires that win 10 did not require
[16:46:33] <Bco1981> tpm 2.0
[16:46:38] <Bco1981> module
[16:46:40] <amigojapan> Ah yes
[16:46:50] <MootPoot> LTT did a video where they showed that win11 hurts cpu performance on ryzen chips due to the more even spreading of workload
[16:47:00] <MootPoot> and that makes the cpu have to talk between CCDs more often
[16:47:15] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.24)
[16:47:19] <MootPoot> They're probably going to release special windows 11 sceduler updates for both intel and amd
[16:47:39] <MootPoot> I think they removed that requirement
[16:47:41] <Bco1981> that don't make sense... the ryzen cpu's are great ffor even load ??
[16:47:45] <MootPoot> after some backlash
[16:48:23] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  the ryzen cpus are multiple smaller cpu dies stuck together, win 10 tries to stick all the load on cores for only 1 side at a time even if it resutls in fewer cores having more load

[16:49:41] <MootPoot> but speading the workload across all cores evenly results on the preference of sticking to the workload on only one CCD if possible
[16:50:04] <MootPoot> scratch that
[16:50:23] <MootPoot> keeping it on one ccd reduces the limiation of the infinity fabric between the CCDs

[17:15:17] <MootPoot> There was some stat I read about TPM and enabling secure boot because of having TPM that reduced malware instances by like 60% or something
[17:15:29] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: everything is arbitrary

[17:20:52] <Sapphirus> Maybe Microsoft will reverse the system requirement once they realise the low adoption rate.
[17:20:56] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: the point is to get the overall standard of security higher; if we followed your logic even passwords are pointless for home users 
[17:21:17] <MootPoot> They already "unofficially" allowed a way in without a TPM to accomodate everyone 
[17:21:34] <MootPoot> If they didn't want it they would have locked it down 
[17:22:13] <MootPoot> M$ does a lot of stuff like that, another example would be allowing win7/8> win 10 upgrades for free well after the free upgrade date is gone 
[17:22:26] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, Microsoft already confirmed that will be removed in the final release.
[17:22:31] <MootPoot> Even though officially it wasn't allowed 
[17:22:41] <Bco1981> MootPoot: and then they made windows 10 completely free
[17:22:45] <Sapphirus> TPM is only being forced to drive PC sales. That's the rationale from within Microsoft as told by close industry insiders.
[17:22:46] <Bco1981> then/now

[17:24:16] <MootPoot> And those are the 99% 
[17:24:19] <Sapphirus> Windows 11 market share will be fully saturated and end up with a small fraction of users.
[17:24:33] <MootPoot> Effectively for the market for computers is just fine 
[17:24:37] <Sapphirus> That's what I see happening if they enforce this hardcore.
[17:24:38] <Bco1981> MootPoot: the problem is tscm, the company that makes chips, gpu's cpus... any.. is in shortage.

[17:25:29] <MootPoot> You can walk to best buy and get a pc for a normal price that does what 99% of users need it to 
[17:25:57] <MootPoot> And that PC will be capable of satisfying the TPM requirement
[17:26:02] <Bco1981> you can't buy a gpu, because all sellers put them in prebuilds now
[17:26:24] <Bco1981> people want a gpu, so they have to buy a complete system
[17:26:26] <MootPoot> True, but again, the vast majority of people don't build their PC's

[17:38:18] <coeus> the world is becoming like this: manufacturers are short on supply, so people selling the chips are asking for more money, the people asking for more money get hassled over conspiracy theories, so some of that money has to be used to fix the problem so they can increase the value of their stock, people buying the product go broke, thus trading is limited to only the super rich, the price for 
[17:38:18] <coeus> a single chip skyrockets, and manufacturers are happy again

[17:46:00] <coeus> so in other words, you need to know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that will buy the chips and sell them to you at a reasonable price
[17:48:39] <coeus> my point is, the average person is getting squeezed because they are not putting nearly enough money into the pool to create a market for the product
[17:49:10] <MootPoot> Wym 
[17:49:19] <coeus> you could easily be paying five times as much just because you are a unique buyer
[17:49:23] <MootPoot> The average person dosent need to put money in the pool
[17:49:34] <MootPoot> Giants like HP and Dell do that for the consumer

[17:51:22] <coeus> yeah my pc cost me $180
[17:51:31] <coeus> it's a HP laptop
[17:51:31] <Sapphirus> I think the fact that Microsoft gets money from every new PC purchase for a Windows license speaks for itself with regards to the TPM requirements.
[17:51:35] <ButterNoodle> does it run gentoo?
[17:51:53] <Sapphirus> Not only does it make them money, it makes OEMs more money.
[17:52:10] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: but those licences would be sold anyway 
[17:52:35] <MootPoot> People won't upgrade to a new pc to get windows 11, they'll upgrade because their old one is shit 
[17:52:41] <Sapphirus> Not if people didn't need to buy a new PC to replace their perfectly working PC because of an arbitrary line drawn.
[17:52:55] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: why would they?
[17:53:09] <MootPoot> What, will windows 10 stop working suddenly?
[17:53:20] <Sapphirus> Then consider all the e-waste that is going to create, when most computers built within the last 6-7 years are satisfactory for most people.
[17:53:35] <MootPoot> By 2025 any computer old enough won't be worth keeping anymore
[17:53:55] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: no
[17:54:04] <MootPoot> Afaik the last year of PC without the ability to satisfy TPM is from 2016

[17:59:09] <Bco1981> x699 HEDT rumored
[17:59:32] <Sapphirus> They slapped more cores and increased core frequency to make up for it.
[17:59:37] <ButterNoodle> yea.. everything I have already has tpm.. who cares?
[17:59:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the fact is that some people still use XP
[18:00:04] <MootPoot> Most recent systems you build should have a TPM header or a TPM update 
[18:00:06] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: someones great grandma...
[18:00:22] <MootPoot> amigojapan: why would a person running XP care about installing win11
[18:00:31] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: my dentist had it in his chair
[18:00:38] <MootPoot> They're probably only running it because their software dosent run on anything else
[18:00:50] <ButterNoodle> wow his dental chair runs XP?
[18:01:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: probably win 10 will be the next XP. Where people use it even after it is not supported
[18:01:25] <MootPoot> amigojapan: probably
[18:01:32] <amigojapan> Yup ButterNoodle 
[18:01:45] <ButterNoodle> ms is deprecating OSs faster.. because they want more money
[18:01:46] <Sapphirus> Windows 11 adoption will probably be as slow as Windows 8 uptake was.
[18:01:52] <MootPoot> But yeah if you have a custom built 22 core whatever from 2015 or 16, you should be able to just buy or update your TPM 
[18:01:52] <Sapphirus> That's my prediction.
[18:01:56] <MootPoot> And problem solved 
[18:02:11] <Bco1981> lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0uQibbtl5Y

[18:02:16] <Sapphirus> It's the next Windows 8 as there's no way people with 2-3 year-old computers are going to buy a new PC just for Windows 11.
[18:02:34] <MootPoot> ^ my point 
[18:02:58] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: Microsoft promised win 10 would be the last version of Windows ever
[18:03:01] <ButterNoodle> and if ur running windows in 2021 without drive encryption (which requires tpm - ik there are shit workarounds).. well idk what to say grandma, time to upgrade
[18:03:10] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I never heard that.. not even once
[18:03:33] <Bco1981> why do you need drive encryption ?
[18:03:37] <MootPoot> Lolis
[18:03:44] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they said it would upgrade forever
[18:03:48] <MootPoot> Memes aside 
[18:03:49] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: why dont you need drive encryption
[18:03:58] <MootPoot> Every system should have it by default 
[18:04:11] <MootPoot> Its about increasing the base floor level of system security everyone has 
[18:04:13] <Sapphirus> Trusting proprietary hardware and software to keep your data securely encrypted would probably be a mistake.
[18:04:24] <Sapphirus> Oh well, 'good enough' for most people.
[18:04:26] <Bco1981> because no one accesses my drives other then me ?
[18:04:38] <ButterNoodle> if ur laptop is stolen, u want every piece of data - all ur dick pics - posted to ur "insert social media site"
[18:04:40] * MootPoot accesses Bco1981s drives 
[18:04:53] <Sapphirus> I'd imagine a very small minority even bothers to utilise bitlocker on Windows.
[18:05:01] * ButterNoodle #metoo's with MootPoot 
[18:05:05] <Sapphirus> Mostly just corporate and business users.
[18:05:17] <MootPoot> Apple already does drive encryption by default
[18:05:17] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: you'd be supprised
[18:05:25] <MootPoot> iOS and Mac OS 
[18:05:25] <Bco1981> that's why you don't leave them on the laptop... vpn home to your NAS
[18:05:29] <MootPoot> Android does it too
[18:05:38] <ButterNoodle> is ur nas encrypted?
[18:05:42] <Bco1981> and don't save the password in the settings
[18:05:42] <MootPoot> Its only windows and Linux where it's not the default
[18:05:43] <MootPoot> Afaik
[18:05:57] <ButterNoodle> its an install option on linux
[18:06:10] <ButterNoodle> like at install, lots of distros ask
[18:06:30] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: best of all, have no Dick pics
[18:06:38] <Sapphirus> Drive encryption can be a moot point if you live in a jurisdiction wherein it's legal to compel the password or encryption keys.
[18:06:46] <ButterNoodle> anyway.. we are getting into a discussion fit for psychological research
[18:07:16] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: ig... I dont live in places where I dont have rights
[18:07:30] <Sapphirus> It's happened in the U.S. before.

[18:11:21] <ButterNoodle> I can copy and paste too
[18:11:24] <Sapphirus> This isn't the only example of it. You can find it, too.
[18:11:27] <ButterNoodle> but the fact is
[18:11:34] <ButterNoodle> he was being charged for a crime
[18:11:37] <Sapphirus> Plenty of examples of this happening in the U.S.
[18:11:39] <ButterNoodle> pls read
[18:12:00] <Sapphirus> Oh sure, but the jail sentence was in relation to him not giving up his password.
[18:12:06] <ButterNoodle> lol no
[18:12:08] <Sapphirus> Unless the Miami Herald is amking shit up.
[18:12:17] <ButterNoodle> you dont understand how the criminal justice system works
[18:12:36] <ButterNoodle> yea its news sensationalism... welcome to america
[18:12:38] <Sapphirus> Sorry if I don't fully grasp the American way as I'm not American.
[18:12:52] <ButterNoodle> if its in the news.. its a lie
[18:13:06] <Sapphirus> There's plenty of examples of this. I just pulled up the first example I could find, but I've heard of many over the years.

[18:13:36] <rando25892> that article about extortion thats pretty serious
[18:13:47] <ButterNoodle> yea.. hearing of it and reading the court documents for what someone is actually being detained for are 2 different realities

[18:16:26] <ButterNoodle> not for -not decryption hard drives-
[18:16:36] <Sapphirus> It's to create a strawman if you try to argue against the precedent they're going for.
[18:17:07] <ButterNoodle> no its the opposite that you are trying to do..
[18:17:21] <ButterNoodle> you are trying to make correlation where there isnt
[18:17:45] <ButterNoodle> please google ur definitions
[18:17:57] <rando25892> strong reasons like these examples is where the warrant will be issue
[18:18:11] <rando25892> the guy got his home raid by the 5 0
[18:18:49] <rando25892> now if it was a wrong address then .. but this guy had a warrant and specifying to search the electronics
[18:19:26] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, nah, if you actually read the article I linked there, this was all about trying to compel self-incrimination. This was all about legal precedent.
[18:19:43] <ButterNoodle> u read the court case?
[18:20:03] <Sapphirus> Did you? lol
[18:20:23] <rando25892> its a reason they held him
[18:20:31] <rando25892> they dont have to hold you if they cant decrypt it
[18:20:31] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: yes, light reading
[18:20:54] <rando25892> cum get you later
[18:21:06] <Sapphirus> From a quick skim of the relevant context, they already had enough to prosecute. They just wanted legal precedent to compel people to decrypt their devices.
[18:21:39] <ButterNoodle> its ok.. keep gaslighting
[18:21:46] <ButterNoodle> you dont need a tpm or win11
[18:23:57] <Sapphirus> How am I gaslighting? Explain. Anyone can quickly read the article and easily figure out what's going on.
[18:25:31] * MootPoot rips a stanky one 
[18:25:36] * MootPoot lights it on fire 
[18:27:31] <Sapphirus> They did partly get what they wanted, though, as courts can hold people for up to 18 months in contempt for refusal to divulge a password for encrypted devices.
[18:27:35] <Sapphirus> U.S. is such a freedom loving place.
[18:27:45] <rando25892> they could decrypt it with him cant they?
[18:27:49] <rando25892> without*
[18:27:54] <rando25892> seems like they didnt
[18:28:07] <MootPoot> Tbh, why can't people just say they forgot

[19:37:14] <amigojapan> darkpeach: Japanese food shows are famous for only saying things are tasty and so exaggerated, they can't say they don't like it
[19:37:33] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: wabisabi

[19:40:13] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I am mostly annoyed cause you can't use those shows as a measure of how good the food is
[19:41:10] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: if they really went out to find tasty food. I may try to eat there
[19:41:14] <Cryowolf> they should bring in Gordon Ramsey and pay him to be superfucking honest

[19:43:34] <Cryowolf> do they have hells kitchen or something in Japan?
[19:43:55] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: there is an American show similar to those Japanese shows. But they say things like "this is the worst of the three ones I tasted"they usually eat 3 kinds of food blindfolded
[19:44:45] <amigojapan> Never heard of it Cryowolf but I heard they would get sued if they said something was bad
