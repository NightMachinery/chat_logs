[13:05:20] <PMT> That sounds like a problem with the box running Freetz, not Debian? Maybe try having the Freetz box format the drive and see if the Debian box can mount it.

[16:24:22] <Khepra> jochum: there's journalctl -fu <unit> if it helps. what _excactly_ do you want displayed?
[16:25:17] <jochum> Khepra: i think about [twisti] question, having the sam problem. From time to time docker is unresponsible, would love something that watches docker and restarts if needed.
[16:25:35] <jochum> Can do by cronjob and others, but would be neat if systemd can do so.
[16:26:12] <Blondie101010> systemd does ensure the services are running, but "unresponsive" doesn't fit well in any blind automated checks
[16:26:44] <Blondie101010> meaning you should specifically do a test for what concerns you
[16:27:15] <Khepra> jochum: the systemd process manager can do excactly that, but the docker service would have to quit as far as systemd is concerned. if docker has a master of its own and it's just workers faulting, that's not gonna work
[16:27:49] <Khepra> I don't have docker around to check the units. what Type is it? simple or forking?
[16:27:52] <Blondie101010> troubleshooting the observed unresponsiveness is the first step
[16:30:31] <jochum> Khepra: unresponsive as in /var/run/docker.sock (or so) doesn't work anymore.
[16:30:47] <jochum> Khepra: i belive dockerd doesn't fork, not sure about that.
[16:31:48] <Khepra> jochum: so if the master service process, from the viewpoint of systemd, doesn't exit, systemd has nothing to restart. "unresponsive" here could mean that the process is still up and the _socket_ is dead. not sure systemd could help unless maybe it manages the socket as well
[16:32:58] <Khepra> that said, docker has had, in the past, massive issues with systemd and cgroups. with bullseye defaulting to cgroupsv2, I don't know if the newer docker adapted, or requires flipping back v1 which would be awful.

[16:57:24] <jochum> Khepra: :)
[16:58:05] <wedwards> I'm having trouble understanding these sentences in https://wiki.debian.org/Python/LibraryStyleGuide: "One very important thing to get right is the Build-Depends line in the source package stanza. setuptools/distribute-based packages have the nasty habit of downloading dependencies from PyPI if they are needed at python setup.py build time. If the package is available from the system (as would be the case when Build-Depends is
[16:58:05] <wedwards>  up-to-date), then distribute will not try to download the package, otherwise it will try to download it. This is a huge no-no, and pybuild internally sets the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables (to 127.0.0.1:9) to prevent this from happening.". Which package is meant by 'the package' in the second sentence?

[17:06:51] <jochum> wedwards: thats what that long sentence tells me
[17:07:09] <randall> jochum: In the case of packaging libraries, pip *shouldn't* be doing that. As the sentence says.
[17:07:24] <jochum> randall: was meant like that
[17:07:43] <jochum> shouldn't ?
[17:07:59] <jochum> ohh ... I'm wrong, I go for a movie and sleep :)

[22:19:27] <greycat> I'm also wondering whether you actually want that automount stuff, or if you'd prefer to simply mount it at boot time.
[22:19:47] <bkeys> Well it is using wifi so I do not think it is connected to the internet at boot time, I could be wrong though
[22:20:40] <bkeys> greycat: I put auto in front of the options and it still requires me to run mount -a to get it to actually mount
[22:21:12] <greycat> "in front of the options"?  you mean in fstab?  I'm talking about /etc/network/interfaces
[22:22:11] <bkeys>  /etc/network/interface just includes all files in /etc/network/interfaces.d/ which is an empty directory
[22:22:21] <bkeys> So I am guessing I am not using /etc/network/interfaces
[22:23:05] <greycat> if you're using NetworkManager then I'm not aware of how to debug that.  Maybe simplify your fstab line, and remove that automount stuff, unless you really do want the mount-on-demand features.
[22:23:45] <jelly> jamea, unless you want to lose data, you need to fix the existing mariadb first, before installing mysql-server.  I strongly suggest making a snapshot or cold backup of /var/lib/mysql before doing anything that could be more destructive (like installing a different mysqld)

[22:56:09] <jamea97> no important
[22:56:18] <jamea97> but need start the servicec
[22:56:24] <jochum> kk, then ask in #maria howto drop the tablespace
[22:56:29] <moha> after exchanging 'dhcp' with 'static' in /etc/network/interfaces, it's not enough to restart networking.service! indeed by restarting service, network is unavailable, it just set and work after a rebooting debian! why in my case?
[22:56:42] <jamea97> jochum ok
[22:57:18] <greycat> if you changed an interface from dhcp to static WITHOUT bringing down the interface first, you will have left an unmanaged DHCP client daemon running, and it'll screw with your interface in the future, until you kill it
[22:57:34] <greycat> so, find the DHCP client daemon process and kill it (or reboot)
[22:57:55] *** Quits: darutoko (~darutoko@92.125.63.134) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:58:29] <greycat> the "correct" way is to bring down the interface first (so ifdown knows there is a daemon it needs to kill), *THEN* edit the file, then bring the interface back up
[22:59:08] <moha> greycat: If I bring down it down, won'i I be disconnected? (over SSH)
[22:59:30] <greycat> "Oh, did I forget to mention it's a REMOTE SYSTEM" !??!??!?
[22:59:47] <moha> sorry
[22:59:50] <dob1> if I have a program in path and I want to use a program with the same name but in different path, the right way is export PATH=/path/to/program/:"$PATH" ?
[22:59:51] <greycat> Question: WHY are you screwing with the interfaces if it's a remote system?  Is it working now?  Leave it alone.
[23:00:27] <greycat> dob1: either that, or invoke the one you want using its full pathname
[23:00:57] <moha> greycat: in a Lab env; I'm learning by the book "Mastering Linux Network, PacktPub"
[23:01:27] <moha> Lab is on a cloud service.
[23:02:03] <greycat> so the reason you are screwing with the interface is to *learn*?  well, you're learning, I guess.
[23:02:22] <moha> yes ((:
[23:02:37] <moha> thanks
[23:02:44] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[23:03:24] <greycat> if you *have* to change interfaces on a remote system, you want to set up a dead-man's switch that'll revert the configuration to the previous, known-working state after a few minutes, or something similar.
[23:03:49] <greycat> if you don't know how to do that, you are *not* ready for this
[23:04:23] <PMT> Or if the cloud service offers the ability to rollback the VM. :)

[23:10:45] <moha> I was just wondering why sudo is not installed by default (:
[23:10:48] <dob1> I would like to install munin-plugins-java but with no all the java things, I want to use my java installation.. better to give up and don't use the package?
[23:11:12] <greycat> sudo is installed if you choose NOT to enter a root password at installation time (which means you cannot use single-user mode)
[23:11:49] <greycat> personally I just install sudo after the initial installation
[23:12:04] <dob1> It would be useful a "fake java pacakge", where someone point to an existing java installation
[23:12:26] <greycat> !equivs
[23:12:26] <dpkg> equivs is a package that enables you to create dummy packages that tell <apt> you really have installed (through some other means) the package.  apt install equivs, and read /usr/share/doc/equivs/*, see also <usrlocal>.  A better plan is often to adapt the Debian packages to your needs, ask me about <package recompile> <uupdate> <ssb>.
[23:12:43] <Khepra> dob1: munin plugins are essentially scriptlets in /usr/share/munin/plugins that you can plop from its github, if installing the pacakge is concerning. you can actually plop them anywhere, and symlink into /etc/munin/plugins/
[23:12:54] <moha> bash: sudo: command not fount. 
[23:12:58] <moha> (net installed)
[23:13:17] <dob1> Khepra, it was one of the options infact.
[23:13:23] <Khepra> dob1: I do that a lot
[23:13:35] <moha> greycat: I defined a root password in the installation peocess
[23:14:02] <greycat> good.
