[05:01:15] <emanuele6> mm, odd

[05:01:41] <emanuele6> xterm terminals show up in who, but rxvt-unicode terminals don't

[05:05:25] <txtsd> No really. Why does conky ramp up Xorg usage SO MUCH?
[05:05:41] <demonicmaniac1> does depend on the setup a bit
[05:05:53] <thrice> is it constantly polling your system for stats?
[05:06:03] <demonicmaniac1> if you reduce the update delta and not make it use pseudo transparency
[05:06:12] <demonicmaniac1> and especially if you don't draw graphs with it but just text output
[05:06:49] <txtsd> It /is/ polling. It shows me CPU, RAM, diskusage, network usage and plugged in USB devices. No transparency because no compositor.
[05:07:05] <demonicmaniac1> conky does pseudotransparency by default when there's no compositor
[05:07:21] <demonicmaniac1> which means it has to copy software framebuffer data from xorg windows behind it 
[05:07:36] <demonicmaniac1> which is hella expensive even more than a compositor just blending

[05:11:02] <txtsd> Openbox + tint2
[05:11:12] <demonicmaniac1> if you make conky just output to text you can probably get it down to 1%

[05:11:37] <rienske> txtsd: iirc, you can put all this information that conky shows into tint2.
[05:12:09] <demonicmaniac1> you could also just have a htop window as your root window below anything else on the stack
[05:12:20] <demonicmaniac1> even on an old c2d that wouldn't use more than 1% cpu

[17:57:26] <colo> pro, *actual* NVMe will be exposed via PCI Express, not SATA. both variants of mass storage might share the same physical connector(s), though. boards can support both, whilst storage modules are either the one or the other.
[17:58:19] <pro> yup I'm noticing NVMe is separate entry from SATA and SATA M.2 in bios
[17:58:48] <pro> and when I booted archiso, it was /dev/nvme and not /dev/sda as I used to see when working with older ssd's
[17:58:54] <colo> as MrElendig says, some NVMe storage can have its namespaces (~ low-level partitions-of-sorts) configured to use different native block formats. it should yield a small performance benefit to use 4K instead of 512 byte sectors, if tour adapter exposes/allows for configuration of that
[17:59:50] <colo> yeah, you will have at least one namespace on that NVMe device then (/dev/nvme0n1), that you will want to partition. check out the `nvme` cli util to change namespace formats.

[18:13:10] <pro> what is the difference between creating and attaching a namespace?
[18:13:17] <colo> (even the option to create more than 1 ns is reserved for modules supporting that)
[18:13:23] <mpan> No, it’s just another way of addressing devices. But if it for some reason fails with /dev/mapper entries, perhaps this path will work.

[18:13:45] <jbg> ah right, i could mount the rootfs using that path instead and maybe grub can work it out then

[21:58:53] <Foxboron> and given the usage, having 32 GB occupied might not really give you anything
[21:59:11] <Foxboron> I have 8 GB on my installs and never see SWAP creep over 3 GB
[21:59:51] <marcello42> hey guys, I am using snapper incl. pacman hook so I have a snapshot pre and post using pacman. So apparently something went wrong with the last update.. so I am thinking about rolling back.. I used snapper rollback with clasic ambit rebooted but GRUB booted into the latest version (BTRFS) ..fstab is using subvolid 256 for /  ..what am I missing here?
[22:00:51] <thunder> okay. reason I ask is it seems like a decent workaround for not having a lot of ram on a system, especially given most VPS run off nvme ssd these days. so for example if I were doing some really memory intensive work on the vps, like video editing or the like, it seems like adding a big swapfile would essentially make the problem of not enough ram just go away
[22:02:48] *** Joins: Elodin (~weechat@user/elodin)
[22:03:23] <thunder> I had thought perhaps without enough physical ram, there might be a constraint in effecively/efficiently addressing the swapfile contents. that's the only thing I could think of that would make a large swapfile potentially not useful, but I'm just guessing there cuz my technical understanding of how that works is basically zero

[22:26:33] *** Quits: polve (~polve@user/polve) (Client Quit)
[22:26:36] <ghostbuster> ohh sorry i'm not using pacman, using makepkg -s
[22:26:41] <thurstylark> optional dependencies are optional. they aren't installed unless you ask for them to be installed
[22:26:50] <thrice> ghostbuster: should be the same story
[22:27:05] <thurstylark> same goes for makepkg (which just uses pacman to do the installing)
[22:27:05] <thrice> though an "optional" dep might be needed at build-time (build depend)
[22:27:13] <ghostbuster> the same package is listed under makedepends and optdepends
[22:27:23] <thurstylark> makedeps are implicitly runtime deps
[22:27:25] <thunder> colo: initially the reason this came up is because I have an entry level vps for which the oom reaper was killing attempts to update antivirus signatures and ide services, so I had to add a bigger swap. consequently the problem went away and I noticed a significant performance boost on the system in general. but it got me thinking about what the limit is on swapfile size and what are the most important considerations in that respect. since ssd's are 
[22:27:25] <thunder> ubiquitous and very nearly as good as ram (at least compared to yesteryear) I thought hey .. I can add more memory just by increasing the swap! golden!

[23:21:37] <demize> How Arch wants to brand itself is certainly a discussion worth having though.  Do we still want to specifically target the latest hardware, or do we now want to have a broader range of support?

[23:28:47] <grawity> Earnestly: so iirc there were talks of Architecture = x86-64-v4 x86-64, and two repos
[23:29:14] <BrainDamage> that would be interesting if arch went multiarch, if the solution is general enough
[23:29:24] <BrainDamage> it could be extended to other platforms too
[23:29:30] <jonathon> re branding, "latest hardware" made sense in i686 vs x86_64 terms, but not sure it makes as _much_ sense in x86_64 vs x86_64_v3 terms. if it's for performance tuning then -mtune=x86_64_v3 could be a reasonable middle-ground, but i'm not sure whether it would see the same improvements as removing old instructions using -march
