[00:46:42] <antto> <*status> Cannot connect to IRC (Network is unreachable). Retrying...
[00:46:55] <antto> i am getting this quite often before connecting
[00:47:31] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.47.41)
[00:48:11] <MetaNova> what destination?
[00:48:16] <MetaNova> do you have any bindhosts set?
[00:48:22] <MetaNova> can you resolve the server address in console?
[00:48:51] <antto> i noticed it happen on 3 different networks
[00:49:12] <antto> so i'm wondering if it's something with the actual machine
[00:49:46] <MetaNova> if the same connectivity error happens on multiple different IRC networks, the common factor is the machine it's running on (or the internet connection that machine is using)
[00:50:25] <antto> how do i test if i can resolve things?
[00:50:39] <MetaNova> from the console, $ host example.com
[00:50:41] <antto> resolveip?
[00:51:18] <MetaNova> (console of the machine which is running ZNC, either local or SSH)
[00:51:26] <antto> huh, don't have that command
[00:51:30] <MetaNova> um
[00:51:34] <MetaNova> dig
[00:51:35] <Casper> Or there must be some horrible routing from your location to their nets :^) 
[00:51:37] <MetaNova> or nslookup
[00:51:45] <MetaNova> if 'host' isn't available
[00:51:55] <antto> nor that one
[00:52:02] <Casper> Which OS do you run?
[00:52:21] <antto> debian
[00:52:47] <Casper> sudo apt install dnsutils <- Then :p
[00:52:51] <Casper> Then you should be able to do host example.com
[00:53:06] <illu> sudo?
[00:53:09] * MetaNova closes the manpage for apt-cache
[00:53:34] <illu> sudo or not sudo that's the question
[00:53:45] <Casper> You need sudo to apt install :p
[00:53:57] <Casper> Unless you run as root by default *shudders*
[00:54:03] <antto> well, it immediately resolves..
[00:54:31] <illu> su sudo

[02:22:31] <MetaNova> that modperl and modpython are not selected for compiling even when dependencies are met without specifying them?

[02:25:54] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ https://wiki.znc.in/Installation#Source_Tarball
[02:26:29] <MetaNova> it wouldn't hurt to clarify this further in some way, outside of the module pages accurately indicating you need to specify them during configure
[02:28:21] <uplime> yeah, having them behind a build option makes sense, it just didn't occur to me to look for that that since the build output just said "Python: no"
[02:28:42] <MetaNova> checking what configure options I have is always the first thing I do
[02:29:01] <MetaNova> (outside of req eg autoregenconf)
[02:29:13] <uplime> i would for ./configure. does cmake offer something like that?
[02:29:27] <MetaNova> I don't know
[02:29:50] <MetaNova> I'd be surprised if there weren't
[02:30:42] <MetaNova> "(use ccmake or cmake-gui to see other configure options)"
[02:31:15] <uplime> there kind of is with `cmake -LAH` although its not exactly the same thing I think
[02:31:29] <uplime> thats just after a moments research though, i dont often use cmake
[02:31:36] <MetaNova> neither do I
[02:32:33] <uplime> oh well, thanks for the help. its good now either way
[02:38:37] <DarthGandalf> uplime: configure is now a simple wrapper over cmake
[02:38:52] <DarthGandalf> all the logic of detecting the libraries and enabling them is implemented via cmake
[02:39:13] <DarthGandalf> ccmake or cmake-gui can help you use cmake directly if you don't want the wrapper
[02:40:10] <uplime> oh so ./configure is fine to use?
[02:40:24] <uplime> thats perfect for me then
[02:44:58] <DarthGandalf> that's why it's there
[02:45:17] <DarthGandalf> people are used to use that script
[02:45:22] <DarthGandalf> we just changed the implementation of it
[02:45:59] <DarthGandalf> probably not ./configure though, but mkdir build; cd build; ../configure :)

[11:52:41] <KindOne> tomf: what do you mean?
[11:54:25] <tomf> this is driving me nuts. On both freenode and libera I sent add * *highlight *%nick%* to watch -- set the sources to * and also SetDetachedClientOnly true. Exiting weechat I send myself a message via the respective webchats in a channel. the *highlight for freenode works like a charm, but not libera 
[11:56:00] <tomf> the webchat accounts aren't registered and have identical hostmasks, etc. 
[11:58:24] <tomf> it also works if I have SetDetachedClientOnly false, which it should 
[12:03:56] <tomf> scratch that. its something with this weechat config. It works fine with my linux laptop. Its bizarre
[12:12:41] <tomf> boom! zncplayback for weechat wasn't set to pull libera. late night smooth brain :)

[21:35:19] <Czernobog> <username>/<network>:<password> to specifiy a network

[21:36:33] <Czernobog> not SASL?
[21:36:46] <DarthGandalf> ZNC doesn't yet implement SASL on the client side
[21:37:08] <DarthGandalf> but there should be some way to send the server password in yuor client
[21:37:45] <Czernobog> the /quote pass command?
[21:38:49] <DarthGandalf> that works but too manual
[21:39:08] <DarthGandalf> does the client not have the way to send PASS automatically?
[21:39:23] <DarthGandalf> what other auth modes are there, other than SASL?
[21:39:35] <Czernobog> it does have authentication mode SASL
[21:39:52] <DarthGandalf> only one mode?

[21:40:40] <Czernobog> that is all 
[21:40:45] <DarthGandalf> 2 modes only?
[21:41:17] <Ramses> if you get to the server tab, does it have user and password field?
[21:41:29] <Czernobog> yes and it has an option for server password but no user

[21:44:44] <Czernobog> oh
[21:44:55] <Czernobog> wait a couple of minutes

[22:14:17] <noarb> will SASL EXTERNAL fail if the services decide so for some other reason than a certificate match? I know that's not znc, but any ideas how to look into that? Could an access list cause it to fail maybe?
[22:17:47] <DarthGandalf> no, it sends it to your client
[22:18:11] <DarthGandalf> if you have only EXTERNAL enabled, only EXTERNAL will be attempted, and EXTERNAL means a cert
