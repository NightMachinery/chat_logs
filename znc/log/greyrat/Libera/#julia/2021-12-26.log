[07:56:27] <random-jellyfish> does using immutable variable and pure functions improve performance in julia?
[07:57:48] <random-jellyfish> variables*
[07:59:19] <ninjin> I am pretty sure that immutable variables – as longs as you are not in the global scope – does not matter as the compiler analysis is fairly simple.
[08:00:43] <ninjin> In terms of pure functions, back when I was up to date – several years ago – I know that the compiler was not advanced enough to detect this. Worth noting is that I think that most languages that are not like say Haskell can not give these guarantees. But I am not a compiler expert by any means.
[08:04:00] *** Joins: Erutuon (~Erutuon@user/erutuon)
[08:04:27] <random-jellyfish> I would expect that functional purity will make it easier to parallelize the execution later on due to the lack of side effects
[08:04:52] <random-jellyfish> so it would still be an advantage
[08:05:49] <random-jellyfish> as for immutability...I wonder if the garbage collector treats immutables different
[08:07:11] <ninjin> Of course it is an advantage, but the question is how easy it is for the compiler to realise that it is indeed pure. =)
[08:07:32] <ninjin> I think there is a macro to declare it, but I am not sure what effect it has.
[08:09:02] <ninjin> How would the garbage collector treat immutable vs mutable differently though for variables? I get it for *types*, but not variables.
