[13:15:34] <fnutt> bookworm, MaxLeiter: Thoughts on https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4313#issuecomment-923765363 ?
[13:15:45] <fnutt> Not sure if PR author is up for the task though.
[13:16:48] <fnutt> He seems to not be in this channel, sadly.
[13:17:18] <majavah> I am
[13:17:56] <fnutt> Lovely :) What are your thoughts on this, if I may ask?
[13:19:09] *** Joins: jinxd (~jinxd@162.250.233.55)
[13:19:25] <fnutt> I'm not sure how much code it would require to implement it. However, it for sure is more along the path the former maintainers made it clear they wanted it (because the suggestions in the earlier PR went waaaay overboard).
[13:22:54] <majavah> That's a good idea for smaller channels, but I'm a bit worried on how it will work for large channels where there might be dozens of joins/quits/etc in one collapsed message - I still want to hide them to one line
[13:23:53] <fnutt> Would this be better?
[13:24:07] <fnutt> @User1-newnick,+User2, User5 and User12 has joined the channel | %User8 is now known as %User9-newnick and User6 is now known as User7 | @user13 opped, +User20 voiced | User19 has quit
[13:24:16] <fnutt> That way you have it one-line.
[13:25:59] <fnutt> Or you can... @User1-newnick,+User2, User5, User48, User12 and 10 others has joined the channel | etc... etc...
[13:26:06] <majavah> that might become a rather long line, but probably yeah, it's better
[13:26:33] <fnutt> If more than 5 users per action, add "and X others".
[13:28:19] <fnutt> I don't mind whatever solution we get in the end, but it would be better to work on solutions as above rather than hotfixing the one-user-one-action line, if my opinion.
[13:28:36] <fnutt> in my opinion*
[13:28:55] <majavah> fair :)
[13:29:29] <fnutt> I don't make decisions here though.
[13:29:50] <fnutt> Just out of curiosity, is this something you would have time and knowledge to implement?
[13:30:25] <majavah> I'm rather busy in the next week or two (exams) but after that, probably yeah
[13:32:07] <shadoozo> Yay, exams
[13:32:24] <fnutt> Gotta love and hate them. ;p

[20:26:06] <mooff> ircv3.net lists thelounge as supporting message-tags, but i can't find any code relating to it
[20:27:04] <mooff> i'm thinking of a plugin to support the Twitch display-name tag (why couldn't they just include capitalization in NICK/PRIVMSG/* like everybody else)
[20:27:24] <mooff> any tips?

[20:37:27] <bookworm> it's used for things like server-time
[20:39:48] <bookworm> the code that handles the tag stuff is irc-framework though
[20:42:58] <mooff> ah, thanks
[20:47:01] * mooff notes that said framework's IrcMessage#to1459 includes tags, hehe
