[01:40:30] <artchad> I'm wondering how I would go about providing the user with a list of candidates to select before visiting the file.
[01:41:25] <acdw> artchad: you'll want to invoke `completing-read' in the interactive form
[01:44:34] <artchad> I'm not sure how I would do that. #'interactive only takes a single optional argument.

[01:47:19] <artchad> Is there a benefit to using the list constructor instead of just quoting the list?
[01:47:39] <acdw> quoting the list doesn't evaluate the arguments 
[01:48:12] <acdw> like, '((+ 1 2) (string-to-number (read-from-minibuffer "x: "))) will just give that list as the a argument to your function
[01:48:16] <artchad> then the function would not be called and the whole thing would probably behave like gibberish.
[01:48:17] <acdw> which ... isn't useful
[01:48:38] <acdw> well the function will be called, it'll just be given a list and nil to add together, which won't work
[01:49:08] <acdw> (interactive) tells emacs a way to interactively pass arguments to the function
[01:49:24] <acdw> the function takes a list of arguments, and interactive returns a list of arguments
[01:49:37] <artchad> yeah. I just remembered the difference between using #'list and just quoting the list. Need to get back into the groove of lisping.
[01:49:44] <acdw> you just tell interactive how to build that list, either with a special string or an actual list

[01:54:17] <bpalmer> evaluating (list whatever whatever) , that is.
[01:54:51] <bpalmer> You can even use quasiquoting to selectively evaluate some things: (defun artchad-add (a b) (interactive `((+ 1 2) ,(string-to-number (read-from-minibuffer "x: ")))) (message "%S" b))
[01:55:31] <bpalmer> that means a will be the unevaluated list '(+ 1 2)  and b will be read in from the minibuffer
[01:57:43] <acdw> bpalmer: ahhh, thanks for that. so `((+ 1 2) (string-to-number...)) will result in a b of '(string-to-number...)

This roughly corresponds to Foucault's heterotopia of time that accumulates indefinitely. The `Zone' also represents a double levelled juxtaposition of time through the way it is represented and through the way it `assimilates' various objects. Evocative in this sense are the multiple shots of foliage
[07:52:45] <edrx> , water, rock, dilapidated buildings and destroyed machines. But probably the most suggestive scene unfolds at the middle of the film, depicting a collection of `relics' lying still in the water and in time: a syringe, a bowl, a glass dish with a goldfish, rocks, a mirror, a metal box enclosing roman coins, a plunger, a part of Jan Van Eyck's Ghent altarpiece with coins lying on it, a coiled spring, a pistol, a torn

[08:30:57] <bpalmer> I don't know anybody who runs with that environment variable on, but it is something to be aware of just in case.

[08:32:23] <dirtcastle> it's 100% probable that it is on if that is what comes by default.

[12:27:33] <Unicorn_Princess> jtza8, spacemacs shows a list of shortcuts when you press spc. so spc, and a list pops up, and one of the items is e.g. "help", under h. so to access help, you press spc and then h. but "other toggles" is listed under C-t in that same menu. so one would think spc + C-t would get me there, same as spc + h gets me to the help menu. alas, it doesn't work for C-t

[22:14:43] <thblt> isn't ctrl-arrow the way to change virtual desktops on MacOS?
[22:14:50] <Common-Lisp> thblt: yes.
[22:15:06] <anticomputer> also possible there's a colission between mac's native bindings to switch screens and emacs grabbing control-direction in your mode
[22:15:22] <anticomputer> i have all that stuff mapped under Super for mac to prevent ctrl problems
[22:16:11] <Common-Lisp> I don't think it's a keybinding collision, because it doesn't happen 100% of the time
[22:16:49] <Common-Lisp> When it does happen, it will happen until I do something to make it stop (eg switch buffers or exit fullscreen in Emacs), but if I undo that and try again it sometimes doesn't

[22:28:23] <Common-Lisp> yeah 
[22:28:23] <anticomputer> Common-Lisp: well you can still make a dedicated desktop, but it's nice to be able to have other stuff behind the emacs on that same workspace and yoke it to the front focus without having to switch workspace focus entirely
[22:28:40] <Common-Lisp> so wasamasa I'd have to have another spotify client open, even on the same machine, which is somewhat silly.
[22:28:59] <wasamasa> I mean, you're using spotify
[22:29:09] <wasamasa> when I open it in my browser, it asks me to enable DRM
