[00:23:33] <DerekKozel[m]> Hi David
[00:23:47] <DerekKozel[m]> That's an interesting pairing, what role would you want GNU Radio to take there?
[00:26:02] <DerekKozel[m]> It looks like there's a REST API for reading and writing data. You could use a custom Python block to send or receive data.
[00:26:02] <DerekKozel[m]> https://uk.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/use-raspberry-pi-board-that-runs-python-websockets-to-publish-to-a-channel.html
[00:27:18] <DavidGarca[m]> I am in a radar project with adalm pluto, for this we use gnu radio and want to display the resulting graphs (like distance to the object) in thingspeak.

[02:02:59] <marvinXP> hmmâ€¦ doesn't seem to be possible to use byte in const source in rc4.
[02:08:49] <funkylab[m]> uhhh I don't have a RC4 build readily at hand now, and can't reproduce. But that seems important?
[02:09:14] <funkylab[m]> could you open an issue on https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues , maybe?
[02:13:48] <marvinXP> gah, no it's my old enemy ~/.gnuradio/config.conf again, that overwrites where grc looks for blocks
[02:14:49] <Yamakaja[m]> config.conf?
[02:15:36] <Yamakaja[m]> Interesting, i only have a grc.conf on my system
[02:15:58] <marvinXP> ~/.gnuradio/config.conf sometimes (at random times. I've not yet found the pattern) overwrites the config with a bogus block path
[02:16:01] <marvinXP> global_blocks_path = /usr/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks:/usr/local/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks
[02:16:15] <marvinXP> No. It should never look for blocks there.
[02:17:22] <marvinXP> I have a wrapper script for starting grc with the different versions I have (installed in different paths). I think I'll have to add a `sed -i` to that script to delete that line on every grc launch
[02:17:41] <funkylab[m]> huh, that never happens for me!
[02:18:14] <funkylab[m]> that would also be worthy of a bug report, marvinXP .
[02:19:01] <funkylab[m]> matter of fact, never even have a global_blocks_path entry in there
[02:19:01] <marvinXP> I don't even know if it's a current version. quick grep at HEAD doesn't seem to have any setting of that option, only getting.
[02:19:14] <funkylab[m]> yeah
[02:19:50] <funkylab[m]> generally, yes, our config management can write configs, but it's a bit surprising to write env-variable settings there.

[06:11:06] <RyanVolz[m]> This exact problem with global_blocks_path in the config file is what https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/pull/4502 is meant to solve. I haven't updated the PR in a while because we kinda concluded that another approach would be better, but I'm still using that patch in the conda-forge builds to avoid multiple-environment problems.

[06:16:36] <RyanVolz[m]> From what I remember, it's a setting that is in the default system config, but any time a user changes any setting, all of the settings are written back to the local configuration file. From then on, the global config file is effectively ignored because all of the local settings take precedence. And that's how you get an outdated global_blocks_path in your local settings file.

[07:00:40] <linge93[m]> Hello, I'm here again. I recently used usrpb210 + OFDM to transmit data again. OFDM uses gr-digital / examples / ofdm/ tx_ ofdm. grcï¼Œrx_ofdm.grc, I can receive data normally every time I transmit, and the number of packets is correct. 
[07:00:43] <linge93[m]> I wrote an OOT source, which successively outputs multiple groups of data (196800 in each group), but the interval between each group is 10s. However, I found that only the first group of data can be received correctly at this time, and the data of the following groups will be lost (1 ~ 2 packets). I don't think it's a problem with my code, because when I use ZMQ instead of USRP to connect the transceiver flow diagram, everything is normal.
[07:01:01] *** Quits: Foxyfox (~Foxyahuas@200.119.151.228) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:01:23] <linge93[m]> So I did another experiment. I kept the receiver on and sent the above-mentioned groups of data in turn during transmission, but it was not an interval of 10 seconds. After sending a group of data, I closed the transmission flow diagram, changed the data source and re run GRC. In this case, everything was normal, so I was very confused. Why would an error occur when sending the next group of data after an interval of 10 seconds?

[08:29:50] <mcdiarmid[m]> Gidday, 
[08:29:50] <mcdiarmid[m]> I'm currently running GNURadio 3.8.1 (ubuntu 20.04 apt install).  I'm trying to assign CPU affinity based on a script parameter.  However, it appears that when compiling the flowgraph to a python file, all CPU affinity values are set as constants in the python file.  I know I can just edit the python file to solve this problem, but obviously I'd prefer being able to recompile and run my flowgraph after every tweak  without such edits!
[08:29:50] <mcdiarmid[m]> Why do I want to do this?  The flowgraph is a demodulator that I need to run multiple instances of with different parameters.  It's quite CPU intensive though and I've only been able reliably run multiple instances by allocating sets of cores to each instance.
[08:29:50] <mcdiarmid[m]> Thanks :)

[15:58:05] <rodrirq[m]> Is there a way to add a delay between stream transfers? I am using the vector source with the repeat parameter on "Yes", connected to a stream to tagged stream block. When I use a file sink to see the results, I get a HelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHello... But I would like to control it so I can send Hello with a delay between each word
[16:54:20] <Notou[m]> Gnuradio doesn't have an internal concept of time, streams are just a succession of samples without any time stamp. 
[16:54:20] <Notou[m]> So a delay like you describe isn't really possible since, even if you manage to delay the generation of a "Hello" sequence, it would still be the samples generated right after the previous one.
[16:54:20] <Notou[m]> You need to "manually" add samples (with whatever value, probably 0) inbetween your sequances, getting Hello000Hello000Hello000.
[16:54:20] <Notou[m]> To do that, if you know the length of the sequences (as seems to be the case here), you can use either a Stream Mux block (with your stream, and another one full of zeros), or a Vector Insert.

[18:37:41] <cpfig[m]> By the way, I need to use GNU Radio 3.8 on Windows
[18:38:06] <Yamakaja[m]> cpfig: Are you using numpy in your python block?

[18:40:20] <cpfig[m]> any recommendation against using numpy?
[18:40:20] <Yamakaja[m]> Would you mind sharing your algorithm, and how fast does your flowgraph run when you just copy the input to the output?
[18:40:26] <Yamakaja[m]> Nooo, you should be using numpy :)
[18:40:50] <cpfig[m]> I don't mind sharing
[18:41:11] <cpfig[m]> One is just an edge detector on a square wave, saving a history of one sample

[18:42:23] <cpfig[m]> because the final application will run on windows...
[18:42:23] <Yamakaja[m]> Soo, that's not how to numpy. In this code you have basically gained nothing from numpy vectorization

[18:44:35] <cpfig[m]> next is kind of a counter based on the exit of the last block

[18:45:32] <Yamakaja[m]> The key to using numpy efficiently is to express your operations in terms of vector operations. So if you want to add the values of two vectors, you don't add each of them individually, but you just return `veca + vecb`. These sums will then run much faster because they can be implemented in native programming languages
[18:45:50] <cpfig[m]> Next I just "select" a part of trigger signal. Basically one in every five periods of a trigger signal

[18:46:08] <Yamakaja[m]> See for example np.diff to calculate the difference between vector elements, and np.abs to then get the absolute for all of those values (You'll have to cover the edge cases though)
[18:47:59] <cpfig[m]> The thing is that I probably need to analyse sample by sample, in order to run an accumulator that sums every sample
[18:48:32] <Yamakaja[m]> For your second algorithm, you can write that as ((input_items[0] > 0) & (input_items[0] < 2)).astype(np.float32)
[18:48:41] <Yamakaja[m]> * that as `((input_items[0] >, * < 2)).astype(np.float32)`
[18:49:03] <Yamakaja[m]> * that as `output_items[0] = ((input_items[0] >, * < 2)).astype(np.float32)`
[18:49:35] <Yamakaja[m]> cpfig: Well, not necessarily. But if you really do want to operate on samples individually, you might be better off with using cython, numba or just C++ blocks
[18:49:46] <Yamakaja[m]> s/with//
[18:51:48] <cpfig[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Well, I would prefer using Embedded Python Blocks because of their simplicity of integration in flowgraph. But I'm not seeing any alternatives at the moment. I'm still a newbie at his
[18:51:55] <cpfig[m]> s/his/this/
[18:52:57] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, as i said with python you need to know what you're doing if you want things to run at a reasonable speed
[18:53:20] <Yamakaja[m]> If you've got the time, i'd recommend you follow some of the numpy tutorials, because numpy really is quite useful https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html

[22:18:01] <cpfig[m]> as opposed to what I had before, even though it is slow:

[22:18:44] <Yamakaja[m]> What do you mean when you say "it's not working"? Are you getting an error message, bad data, etc?
[22:19:53] <cpfig[m]> sorry, I mean the output is all zeros
[22:21:22] <Yamakaja[m]> Did you make sure to keep the `return len(output_items[0])`? Alternatively try `output_items[0][:] = ((input_items[0] > 0) & (input_items[0] < 2)).astype(np.float32)`, i usually just write C++ blocks ;)
[22:24:39] <cpfig[m]> Your alternative is now ok.
[22:25:01] <cpfig[m]> Maybe I would need C++ blocks, but I don't know if I can make them for windows.
[22:25:24] <cpfig[m]> Not sure of what I am being asked is even possible if Windows is to be used
[22:26:01] <Yamakaja[m]> Try working with numpy first. Rule of thumb when you're getting started: If you're looping over individual values, there's probably a better way

[22:42:38] <marvinXP> I'm failing to do something fairly simple. I have a normal Bell 202 signal modulated over FM. In other words I have BFSK at 1200 and 2200 Hz. I already know this, and was therefore able to decode it. But how do I find it out? No matter how I tweak I can't get a waterfall or frequency sink to show me two nice peaks.
[22:44:11] <marvinXP> I think waterfall / frequency sink takes a chunk, FFT, and displays, then takes the *next* chunk. But wouldn't I get more time resolution (prolonging the time one or the other tone is sent) if it just shifted in one sample at a time?
[22:45:13] <Yamakaja[m]> Something i like to do is to use a tools like inspectrum to inspect the waveform. It can show you phase, frequency and sample information for a specific signal and selected BW. Using FFTs may not be the optimal solution to inspect an FSK
[22:45:24] <Yamakaja[m]> s/an//
[22:47:02] <Yamakaja[m]> Once you know that a signal could be FSK, just try to apply some more appropriate signal estimation techniques like FM demod, etc.

[23:04:07] <Yamakaja[m]> You need to add a frequency plot and select the correct bandwidth
[23:04:16] <Yamakaja[m]> (Right click -> add frequency plot or something like that)
[23:04:20] <marvinXP> And the axis don't have super great resolution. But at least here I see that "it's between 1200 and 2200" (which is correct)
[23:06:02] <marvinXP> Yamakaja[m]: yeah I found some other plots. What is the Y axis for them, though?
[23:06:23] <Yamakaja[m]> Depends on your frequency band selection

[23:12:08] <jholtom> Hi!
[23:12:22] <marvinXP> Yamakaja[m]: Yeah, this is really useful. Do you find inspectrum similarly useful for PSK?
[23:12:29] <Guest5> Awesome! Do you guys work for gnuradio?
[23:12:48] <Yamakaja[m]> marvinXP: Take a look at the phase plot ;)
[23:13:23] <Yamakaja[m]> It's a bit harder to decode the symbols (And you have to align that selector very accurately, but you can certainly use it to determine if a signal looks like a PSK signal
[23:13:28] <Yamakaja[m]> * very accurately), but
[23:15:38] <flynn378[m]> :q

[23:16:11] <Guest5> Can I get some advice? I'm running gnuradio 3.9.5 on a Raspberry Pi. I'm working on adding an OOT module that I previously used on a different system. After attempting to compile the OOT, I get an Error "include could not find load file: GrSwig" and "Unknown CMake command 'GR_SWIG_MAKE'". Any suggestions?
[23:16:44] <Yamakaja[m]> Guest5: Did you happen to switch GNU Radio Versions from 3.8 to 3.9? In 3.9 we're no longer using SWIG
[23:17:05] <Yamakaja[m]> s/Versions/versions/
[23:17:22] <Guest5> Yes, I believe so. I installed the PiSDR image
[23:17:51] <Yamakaja[m]> marvinXP: If you enable that time selection thing you can even use inspectrum to extract the symbols ;)
[23:18:18] <Guest5> Would it be easier to reinstall gnuradio 3.8 or to port over my OOT for 3.9 compatibility?
[23:18:36] <Yamakaja[m]> Depends on your Skillset i guess

[23:18:53] <Guest5> I'm a complete noob to gnuradio. Currently an undergrad student dipping my toes in the water of SDRs for work.
[23:18:54] <Yamakaja[m]> If it works with 3.8 it is probably easier to downgrade to 3.8 though
