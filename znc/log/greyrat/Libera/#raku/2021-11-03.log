[01:57:31] <AntonOks> hi again. same question as yesterday... is there anyone around who has the permission and is willing to review and merge rakudo/star pulls?
[01:58:58] <AntonOks> and if I look at the repo activity in the last months it seems "Star" is a dead horse....https://github.com/rakudo/star/graphs/contributors?from=2019-12-31&to=2021-11-02&type=c
[02:01:35] <MasterDuke> i don't think star ever was terribly active (which isn't all that surprising, it was just packaging rakudo plus some modules), but it's definitely been de-emphasized over the medium-term past
[02:01:54] <AntonOks> someone should decide if "Star" should be (somehow) maintained / supported .... or it should be removed from the raku.org and GitHub organization once and forever :|
[02:03:19] <MasterDuke> now that rakudo is more stable and zef is easily obtained, there isn't quite the same need for star any more
[02:03:19] <El_Che>  AntonOks: I am under the impression that once in a while a new maintener shows up
[02:04:00] <El_Che> for some time
[02:04:53] <lizmat> AntonOks: would you like to be a maintainer ?

[02:08:51] <AntonOks> lizmat: Ok, fair enough.. but then remove it from everywhere... because like it is now, it just adds confusion and a bad reputation on Rakudo itself, right?!
[02:09:29] <El_Che> yeah, the issues stay open for a few years, it seems
[02:12:56] <AntonOks> just to get everyone on the same page... and as far as I was somehow involved in related discussions... you can find some arguments (or only one?!) pro-Star in https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4001
[02:14:58] <AntonOks> as a summary I'd say, especially the MSI package is helpful in some areas where no internet connection is possible and/or "enterprise IT"... 
[02:15:22] <El_Che> taking stuff over can be surprising. I took a small abandoned lib over that was not used directly by many projects (I used it). Now github tells me 20K repos depends on it and I am very carefull not to break it :)
[02:15:41] <El_Che> so, I get your "I don't have the time argument"

[02:40:55] <AntonOks> El_Che: yeap, thats another confusion I complained about 1-2 years ago ;)  ... as far as I remember https://github.com/Raku/rakudo-star lived in the previous "perl6" GH organization... but as it is anyhow even more / longer unmaintained, it should be deleted from the Rakudo GH org anyhow...
[02:41:04] <AntonOks> just my 5 ct's ;)
[02:42:06] <El_Che> I am not a star users, but indeed, even from the outside it looks confusin
[02:42:06] <El_Che> g
[02:43:04] <AntonOks> Nemokosch#9980: well, what Star is... at least this is very well documented, see https://rakudo.org/star
[02:43:21] <AntonOks> it says.. Rakudo Star Bundle
[02:43:21] <AntonOks> The Rakudo Star Bundle contains the Rakudo Compiler, a collection of modules from the Raku ecosystem, and the language documentation. It is released roughly quarterly and is the most thoroughly tested release.
[02:44:01] <AntonOks> btw., the "most thoroughly tested release" is a joke by now ;)
[02:47:46] <El_Che> AntonOks: there is certainly a target audience that like Star. The project needs a maintainer to serve them, otherwise they will stay with old releases. 2021.07 is not that old.

[02:55:04] <AntonOks> El_Che: The MSI was build at https://github.com/AntonOks/rakudo-star-win at that time (was my first Start step... and once the MSI build worked here, I added those MSI build things and also started to extend the "RSTAR" bash thing in https://github.com/AntonOks/star
[02:55:34] <AntonOks> Patrick copied the MSI package from my repo to the "raku.org" at that time...
[02:56:47] <El_Che> ah you did that
[02:56:54] <El_Che> you touch it, you keep it :)
[02:58:01] <El_Che> I see you used actions
[02:58:06] <AntonOks> ehm, and before I confuse you guys even more... Patrick Boecker copied the MSI.. not Patrick Spek :O
[02:58:07] <El_Che> that's nice
[02:58:44] <El_Che> I'll have a look how you did it; it could be a useful addition to rakudo-pkg
[03:02:17] <AntonOks> to be honest... I love rakudo-pkg and I thought about talking to you and asking if you just could add some "zef" lines into your build tools / scripts to ship those "Star modules" per default with your *UX* packages
[03:03:42] <El_Che> I originally though the selling point of star was providing a fixed version of modules known to be stable, but that was not the case
[03:04:09] <AntonOks> I had a discussion with Patrick (Boecker) about what I do in the PowerShell script to add those modules
[03:04:14] <El_Che> therefor just providing zef, seems to be enough. Or are you thinking native dependencies?
[03:05:09] <AntonOks> no, many of those modules (look into the modules.txt or the like) are build ontop of the "master" GH versions :|
[03:05:36] <lizmat> are they?  hmmmm
[03:06:00] *** Joins: sena_kun (~koto@94.142.239.45)
[03:07:05] <AntonOks> ok, what I do in the MSI build is https://github.com/AntonOks/star/blob/94249c7d0e3846fa54ea75c2deb62495253d01a7/tools/build/binary-release/Windows/build-with-choco.ps1#L89
[03:07:58] <AntonOks> the modules installation with "zef" happens here https://github.com/AntonOks/star/blob/94249c7d0e3846fa54ea75c2deb62495253d01a7/tools/build/binary-release/Windows/build-with-choco.ps1#L96
[03:08:12] <AntonOks> so simple, right?!?
[03:08:40] <AntonOks> everyone could do this before a "package" is build... wherever and however ;)
[03:10:25] <AntonOks> lizmat: well, look into https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/etc/modules.txt .. you see where releases are used and where it's just '"master"
[03:13:50] <lizmat> hmmm... I hadn't realized that
[03:14:28] <ugexe> id probably just create a rakudo star meta distribution and list all those modules in the depends
[03:15:50] <AntonOks> El_Che: having ZEF included in any Rakudo package is a "must" from my point of view anyhow... but in some environments the clients / servers / containers (wherever we want Raku to be used ;)  ) do not have internet access and therfore cannot just install any module a dev needs... so any Rakudo installation there needs some helpful everydays modules
[03:15:50] <AntonOks> ;)  ... and documentation ;)
[03:15:54] <ugexe> META6.json -> {"name":"Rakudo::Star", "provides":{}, "depends":["Zef","HTTP::UserAgent:ver<0.1>", ...]}
[03:16:51] <ugexe> then install that via `zef install .`
[03:18:05] <AntonOks> ugexe: would that work in (IT) environments where no internet access is possible / allowed?
[03:18:37] <lizmat> AntonOks: that would be the build process of which to make a R Star I guess ?
[03:18:42] <lizmat> ugexe ?
[03:20:12] <AntonOks> don't get me wrong... everywhere where internet access is possible / available, everyone should just use ZEF to get the desired working environment.. new modules and so on.
[03:22:40] <AntonOks> the question is, do we want to support Raku in "other" areas.. and do we want to support enterprise IT environments and organizations with their needs for pre-packaged, tested and approved "inslattaions packages", which then can be deployed there..

[03:24:10] <AntonOks> need to drop off... close to midnight here... but THANKS for all your thought and ideas...
[03:24:50] <japhb> AntonOks: Well, when you're specifically talking about R*, I think you're asking not "Do we want to support this use case?" but rather "Do we want to support this use case *this way*?"  You could satisfy (a fair portion of) that use case by providing docker images (which we do) or snaps (which we don't) or MSIs
[03:26:09] <El_Che> I don't thing the "no internet" scenario is as widespread as it used to be. I think people use local mirrors and the like if needed
[03:26:42] <El_Che> AntonOks: funny enough the original use case of rakudo-pkg was containers, where you want to keep the size down

[03:33:26] <lizmat> the script I was using to load the module, had a "use v6.*" in it
[03:33:58] <lizmat> without it, it doesn't re-precompile
[03:34:23] <lizmat> oops, wrong channel

[14:28:11] <tbrowder> ugexe: zef is not finding the new Geo::Location
[14:28:13] <tellable6> 2021-10-28T03:16:27Z #raku <melezhik> tbrowder can we change mybfio slogan to "Friendly Software Reviews Network" ? (on raku.org page)
[14:28:48] <tbrowder> uploaded to cpan yesterday
[14:35:06] <tbrowder> .tell ugexe ^^^
[14:35:07] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to ugexe
[14:35:30] <lizmat> tbrowder: zef installs it fine for me
[14:35:45] <lizmat> raku.land also shows it
[14:35:52] <lizmat> and it's in the archive now
[14:36:54] <tbrowder> hm, i see it in archive, maybe i need to upgrade zef...
[14:38:19] <lizmat> zef update
[14:40:10] <tbrowder> update? ok...
[14:41:46] <tbrowder> did that, no change. on two of my hosts zef is not seeing new version of Geo::Location
[14:42:08] <tbrowder> do i need to nuke some zef thing?
[14:42:31] <lizmat> zef uninstall Geo::Location / zef install Geo::Location ?
[14:44:36] <tbrowder> tried that, too, no help
[14:45:09] <tbrowder> bummer...
[14:45:35] <tbrowder> i'll try asking for the ver
[14:47:00] <tbrowder> that worked, weird!
[14:48:48] <tbrowder> i may inadvertently be the culprit: during dev i couldn't wait for cpan and zef installed from the repo.
[14:49:12] <tbrowder> but later i zef uninstalled it.
[14:49:55] <lizmat> ah, yes... that can confuse things, I know from experience :-)
[14:50:04] <tbrowder> gotcha

[15:46:27] <andinus> does .hyper/.race make difference when using it in `for` loop?
[15:47:10] <lizmat> personally, I like to use it with .map for clarity
[15:47:30] <lizmat> the syntax of hyper / race with for is a bit iffy, imo  :-)
[15:48:19] <andinus> ah, i could use map but the job  i'm doing is not really for .map
[15:48:45] <andinus> its takign inputs, generating images
[15:50:35] <andinus> ^ does this seem like a thing for .map? i havent map like this before
[15:51:32] <lizmat> well, anything that is a stream of data that you can process in parallel
[15:52:07] <lizmat> my %hash = @inputs.hyper.map: {  ....; key => value }
[15:52:16] <lizmat> is a common idiom
[15:57:29] <andinus> i see, makes sense, thanks!

[20:37:11] <lizmat> melezhik: if you add a `say %*ENV<LIBERA_SASL_PASSWORD>` before that, does that say what you expect ?
[20:37:34] <melezhik> I am checking this right now, let me see
[20:37:52] <lizmat> alsoL if you want to test your bot, I've set up a #bottest channel for taht

[20:42:29] <melezhik> it's basically IP based restriction, requiring some IP address use SSAL authent

[20:43:36] <melezhik> I am by the way not required to authenticate at all when run irc bot from MY laptop (it has different IP)
[20:44:05] <melezhik> but this is the case when I run irc bot from mybf.io host 
[20:44:12] <melezhik> which has another IP
[20:44:22] <lizmat> melezhik: the only thing I can say at this point, is to make an issue for it
