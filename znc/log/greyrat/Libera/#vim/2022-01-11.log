[02:16:03] <Brutus> ohh that's what you meant
[02:16:20] <nickspoon> Brutus: yeah that's fine, definitely vnoremap, I'm just saying make sure you always use nnoremap/vnoremap etc. and not nmap/vmap
[02:16:39] <zeraphel> anyway ive got to go,  you're in good company
[02:16:43] <nickspoon> If you were hitting your </> mappings then they must have been vmap mappings, not vnoremap

[21:43:33] <jjasghar> hey all, i'm starting my "yearly" vim-adventures, and it seems "r" isn't working how i'd expect.  
[21:43:42] <jjasghar> does anyone else see that issue?
[21:43:52] <romainl> how do you expect it to work?
[21:43:56] <lopid> correct your expectation?
[21:44:09] <romainl> in vim-adventures or in Vim?
[21:44:39] <jjasghar> lopid: i hit "rb" and on osemthing that's supposed to change it from a capitial "B" to a lowercase b. i don't have "~" yet.
[21:45:09] <jjasghar> romainl: vim-adventures. i figured the chance of someone in here doing vim-adventures was high
[21:45:16] <lopid> "~"?
[21:45:17] <romainl> rb is supposed to replace whatever the char under the cursor with b
[21:45:30] <romainl> jjasghar: this is #vim

[22:51:32] <rsaavedra> is it possible to show the current directory in the statusline? I want something like the %f item, but including the current directory
[22:52:17] <markwdev> Hopefully quick question:  I am using autocmd to open a terminal for certain file types. Is there a way to automatically return focus to the buffer after the terminal opens?
