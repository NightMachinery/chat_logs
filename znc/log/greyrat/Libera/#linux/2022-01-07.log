[03:21:31] <koollman> well, yeah. Still a decent option for cheap storage

[03:22:28] <tm512> somewhere out in the garage I've got an external enclosure with a 20MB SCSI drive. this hitachi kinda reminds me of that one lol

[03:23:42] <tm512> but yeah /home is where my stuff is stored, though I could be smarter about it. I've got a lot of programs built from source in ~/code and I should probably start getting those installed to /usr/local which is on SSD

[07:44:40] <GaM3r2Xtreme> Exactly. It was a snap once I got a better understanding of it. My next question is, would there be a way to handle all other requests as an error page? I'd like to send the generic /usr/share/nginx/html/50x.html file. I was thinking something along the lines of adding another server tag with 'server_name ~.*' and 'location *', but it didn't quite work. I seem to get a 404.
[07:44:53] <tirnanog> GaM3r2Xtreme: one other thing to keep in mind is that the first declared server block there will be fallen back upon, in case the Host request issued by the user-agent doesn't match any server_name. this can be a liability in case you reorganise your config file substantially.

[07:46:06] <GaM3r2Xtreme> Ah, so that's why I seem to get the generic hello world page for some requests. Something like 'hello.mydomain.com' would give me that page.
[07:46:07] <tirnanog> GaM3r2Xtreme: for that reason, you might want to make your choice of default server explicit. for example, by writing "listen 80 default_server;" within the server block that you want to be the default choice in case of no match.

[07:47:05] <GaM3r2Xtreme> OK, so that's how you can handle all other cases instead of a regex kind of thing. let me try something quick...
[07:47:06] <tirnanog> another option is to make it so that requests that don't match a declared server_name are denied.

[07:48:09] *** Joins: ice9 (~ice9@user/ice9)
[07:48:24] <tirnanog> no. you designate a default_server with the listen directive and, because there can only be one, it wouldn't make sense for it to exist outside of a given server scope, nor does it need to.

[07:49:45] <tirnanog> you have two "listen 80" directives, so one of them could be a default. or you could make another. basically, I'm just saying not to rely on parsing order to decide which is the default. it could be dangerous further on down the line.

[07:52:54] <GaM3r2Xtreme> unless the location block needs to capture everything, so maybe * instead?

[07:53:26] *** Joins: zro (~zro@user/zro)
[07:53:46] <tirnanog> 444 is a pseudo-status code which will make nginx simply close the connection.

[08:22:13] <memelover> Alright, here's a wacky question - how could I go about getting a 3.5mm SPST switch to act as a keyboard button press? I want to set up the entirely unoriginal vim foot pedal. I'd like to use xbindkeys once it's registered as a button, but I don't know how to get that far.

[08:22:44] <mlu> memelover: do you want a pure software solution (kinda hard) or do you want a $5 hardware solution?
[08:23:14] <mlu> memelover: the $5 hardware solution is to get yourself the cheapest keyboard you can find, extract the controller, and literally hook up the SPST switch to its lines
[08:23:14] <memelover> I think the hardware solution would be better. I thought about treating it as an audio source and that just... feels wrong.

[08:24:39] <SabryTarek> hi
[08:24:47] <mlu> memelover: go google up what a keyboard switch looks like: how it works is that there's generally like 8 rows and 16 columns, and when you press a key down, electrical contact is made between a row and column
[08:24:54] <mlu> the keyboard controller then detects that and sends in the key

[08:24:56] <GaM3r2Xtreme> maybe something like programming an attiny85 microcontroller to act as a HID device on the system through USB? Hit the switch, and it triggers a keyboard press signal.

[08:27:14] <GaM3r2Xtreme> how much do you value your time is the next question.

[09:16:17] <ayecee> client side decorations is indeed the term. thanks tirnanog, i learned something today.
[09:16:39] <tirnanog> judging by the comments, it might not be as simple as just specifying the option, though.
[09:16:42] <ayecee> that is, the app draws the decorations instead of the window manager.
[09:18:13] <Nobrem> I might look into virtualbox

[09:56:15] <sheep> firepup: "sudo su" means "execute 'su' as root"
[09:56:24] <firepup> ah-
[09:56:35] <sheep> but don't use sudo su. Use sudo -i or sudo -s
[09:57:09] <Nobrem> why not just add a real root user and do "su" ?

[09:57:43] <core_contingency> already ran a btrfs scrub start / and it came back fine. Other confunding variables: using systemd-homed and having my home folder be a btrfs subvolume that is mounted to the root filesystem.

[09:58:13] <ayecee> Nobrem: but effectively the same

[09:58:45] <tirnanog> core_contingency: a scrub is not the same thing as a check.
[09:58:55] <Nobrem> ayecee, yep, true,  but I personally always disliked that Ubuntu didn't provide me with the (existing) root user's password
[09:59:44] <Nobrem> sheep, I am in Android Studio now.  Where is that Emulator?
[09:59:52] <ayecee> Nobrem: okay, so when you say "why not", then the reason is you don't need to and it worsens the security posture, by allowing password authentication for root.
[10:00:11] <sheep> Nobrem: Tools > AVD Manager
[10:00:39] <core_contingency> tirnanog: ah, sorry, I thought they were the same thing for btrfs. guess running btrfs check from live media is my next step.
[10:01:11] <tirnanog> core_contingency: I think you should, just in read-only mode for now. the situation is abnormal and it does indicate some issue pertaining to the filesystem's structural integrity.
[10:01:18] <ayecee> core_contingency: looks like this is btrfs related, but i'm not clear how, yet. i don't feel like it's a filesystem error per se, though.

[11:27:05] <tirnanog> and that you wouldn't need to if you let unbound do its job and act as a resolver for queries that don't refer to your zones.
[11:29:00] <KillerWasp> well, that's how i'm trying to do. use unbound for solve domain names, but without using external DNS..
[11:29:59] <KillerWasp> i can't use or depend of external DNS, because all external DNS are brokens.

[12:41:42] <tirnanog> or ...
[12:42:05] <tirnanog> it could just be that /var/log isn't writeable by the user running the unbound process. in that case, you could create a subdirectory and chown it first, then point logfile to that.

[16:32:52] <rascul> this does work though:    flock /tmp -c 'echo hi;echo bye'
[16:33:03] <phogg> but since it just dumps the string into a shell -c invocation I suppose it doesn't really matter what's in it
[16:33:06] <[twisti]> and https://linux.die.net/man/1/flock it says "Pass a single command to the shell with -c."
[16:33:10] <[twisti]> on*
[16:33:30] <rascul> [twisti] what is the problem with it?
[16:33:53] <phogg> [twisti]: "single command without arguments" to me means e.g. "cat" not "cat foo". What it means to say is "pass the command arugment to sh -c as-is"
[16:34:00] <[twisti]> that i didnt know how to properly escape it, now that phogg told me how to (and thanks, in case i havent said it yet) it works as i pasted it
[16:34:00] <phogg> still weird, but that explains how it works
[16:34:13] <rascul> phogg yeah man page doesn't seem to accurately describe -c
[16:34:36] <[twisti]> my paste was from the man page too, maybe that was changed at some point (and is now incorrect)
[16:35:32] <phogg> [twisti]: in the future I recommend you put each part of the pipeline in its own array and then combine them in the arg to -c, e.g.: foo=(cat /etc/passwd) bar=(grep root); flock -c "${foo[*]} | ${bar[*}}"
[16:35:49] <phogg> [twisti]: this should save you all of your quoting trouble
[16:35:57] <[twisti]> ill keep that in mind too
[16:36:21] *** Joins: Tempesta (~Tempesta@user/tempesta)
[16:36:36] <phogg> now let's return to the part where flock(1) exists and ponder what the point is
[16:37:11] <[twisti]> i dont know what that terminology means
[16:37:20] <phogg> I suppose the real use is -n? Otherwise it seems fairly unhelpful.
[16:37:21] <Blondie101010> flock ensures a mandatory file lock, so no other process may have it on the same file at the same time
[16:37:57] <phogg> I am aware of what flock does, but from a shell script the utility seems extremely limited
[16:38:06] <Blondie101010> same as in a program
[16:38:16] <Blondie101010> prevent concurrency
[16:38:26] <phogg> you are not usually writing a shell script which has competing worker children
[16:38:51] <[twisti]> its an rsync cronjob
[16:38:58] <phogg> flock is necessarily cooporative
[16:39:11] <Blondie101010> I've seen quite a few, and since those locks work over some network file systems, it can go beyond the machine's scope
[16:39:16] <[twisti]> if something takes unexpectedly long, i dont want two rsyncs to run at the same time
[16:39:43] <phogg> Blondie101010: but it's advisory locking, so it only really works if everybody involved agrees
[16:40:07] <phogg> [twisti]: I suppose this is one way to be sure of that, yes. Just not one I am used to seeing employed.

[18:34:28] <phogg> I tried openbsd once, then I realized I would have to unlearn iptables and learn pf, so I gave it up. Linux is sufficient for me.
[18:34:49] <grodzio> openbsd overall seems like a nicely put together operating system but it's definitely not for everyone,
[18:35:22] <grodzio> if i wanted to use it for desktop, i'd have to rely on integrated graphics instead of my dedicated graphics card.

[18:36:29] <msiism> Yeah, but Otter is probably a RAM hog.

[19:26:20] <ayecee> XD
[19:26:48] <treefrob> mrfb, yes, because apt-get update seems to be calling apt-show-versions in the background
[19:27:05] <grkblood13> so if I took that image and attempted to copy it do a storage location that had space for the actual size of the image, but not the apparent size, would it copy?
[19:27:25] <ayecee> it would if you copied it as a sparse file

[19:32:17] <jim> grkblood13, I would probably characterize it as "more usual and normal"
[19:32:22] <ayecee> keeping in mind that ls -ls will show the size in blocks, so actual size might be slightly larger than the apparent size as the tail of the file fills a partial block.

[20:49:04] <rendar> with `systemd-analyze blame` i got that `3.184s NetworkManager-wait-online.service` this is the slowest process at boot, but why? 3 seconds to wait online?!
[20:49:27] <lacroix> look at man ext4 which explains that "it can allow old data to appear in files after a crash and journal recovery", it depends on the applications which use the filesystem if they are ready to deal with this. Here is the prob. "old data to appear"
[20:49:34] *** Quits: AlanMD (~AlanMD@86.121.179.183) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:49:38] <lacroix> old data means block that could have been reused somewhere else --> you see data from user/files users
[20:49:53] <lacroix> this is why ordering matters for filesystems. writeback has no order. therefore it is sometimes faster
[20:50:24] <rendar> yes, but some filesystems like XFS uses that writeback by default
[20:50:26] <mrfb> rendar: is the slowest because it waits to network init to finish, is not that it takes that time, it tells you how many time it took until "online"
[20:50:49] <mrfb> removing that has 0 impact on your boot speed
[20:50:52] <rendar> mrfb, should i disable that? why systemd is waiting networking to be online?

[23:35:19] <grkblood13> using sparse I was able to drastically reduce the image size of a drive when compared to a straight dd image of the same drive. taring that sparse image however reduced it even more, but only to the same size as a tared version of the straight dd image. is that normal? if so, why would anyone use sparse and not just tar images directly?

[23:37:57] <grkblood13> yes, sorry
[23:38:01] <ayecee> grkblood13: compression would make the process slower and take more cpu. plus, you couldn't "mount" the image without extracting it.

[23:48:41] <freeone3000> ayecee: Alright, thanks.
[23:48:58] <uwharrie> from the description, it sounds like a program that makes a base volume read-only, boots it, then adds a writable overlay on top of it
[23:49:06] <Platonides> one could probably figure out with procmon where this app was storing the counter
[23:49:14] <AmR> It can't be . All partitions have freeze And Can't save any data after reboot and the pc is offline.
[23:50:14] <Platonides> well, perhaps the freeze wasn't working
[23:50:31] <uwharrie> or perhaps the program that does the "freezing" knows how to also unfreeze

[23:52:43] <ananke> vanfanel64: eg: alias ip='ip --color=auto'
[23:52:45] <moonmoon> unless I'm misunderstanding something, the purpose of programs like deep freeze isn't to prevent writes, it's to re-image the computer to a known good state every so often (e.g. on restart)

[23:53:13] <uwharrie> vanfanel64: or the check out the one-line option
[23:54:24] <uwharrie> moonmoon: it is, but the mechanism appears to be to start with a known good base, run for a while, then either discard or merge what happened between the last snapshot back into the base
