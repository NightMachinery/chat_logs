[01:31:00] <sunyibo> I have znc set up on a server. I'm using weechat to connect. I'd like to connect from several machines simultaneously, but it tells me that my nick is taken. How can I solve this?

[01:33:17] <MetaNova> if you connect to the same user/network from more than one client that shouldn't be causing "nick already in use" issue

[15:04:10] <zs> How can I change ident of all users added in znc-one-shell?
[15:05:08] <zs> Ident should be changed as user name
[15:13:00] <DarthGandalf> what is znc-one-shell?
[15:14:13] <zs> I myself laughed on the question lol
[15:14:45] <zs> I created a znc, added users in it, all users' ident is same which I created first.
[15:15:45] <zs> john@ <=== all ident same john@ 
[15:16:48] <zs> Did I make myself clear now?
[15:18:47] <Khaytsus> If you want each user to have a unique ident you'd need to set up ident I assume
[15:19:07] <zs> YEah
[15:20:20] <zs> Thats all? 
[15:20:50] <zs> I guess that I knew already ... I need to set up ident 
[15:21:12] <zs> Any help?
[15:27:29] <Andrio> zs, did you set the same ident username for each user in the ZNC configuration?
[15:27:52] <zs> No, I changed ident for each users.
[15:29:12] <Andrio> Are you running the ZNC on your own computer?
[15:29:19] <zs> Yes
[15:29:59] <Andrio> Are you already running an ident server there?
[15:31:16] <zs> How to verify?
[15:31:23] <zs> If I am running ident server?
[15:32:33] <Andrio> on the server where you have ZNC installed, `telnet localhost 113`
[15:34:58] <zs> It is connected
[15:35:20] <Andrio> ok
[15:35:28] <Andrio> Are you using oidentd or ident2?
[15:35:45] <zs> oidentd I guess
[15:37:14] <Andrio> ah, ok.

[16:31:19] <Khaytsus> Is there anything in znc that would figure out invites?  I had someone invite me to a channel and I didn't see it in irssi or weechat (both connected to znc), so either I'm filtering on both (which I don't think I am, but..  who knows) or it's znc.  I just can't figure out what it is.
[16:31:56] <DarthGandalf> [[raw]]
[16:31:56] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/raw
[16:32:21] <DarthGandalf> or znc -D | grep -i invite

[20:57:22] <kour1er> I'm not sure if this is a znc thing or a client thing (textual and palaver in this instance) - I've set up multiple clients using these instructions: https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients but I'm seeing an odd behaviour on private messages - if I connect simultaneously on textual on my mac and palaver on my iPhone and iPad, if I send pm from my mac (to a different user via a web browser), I see that message echoed twice
[20:57:22] <kour1er>  on my iPhone and iPad. If in the same setup, I send a message from my iPad, I see it echoed twice on my mac and iPhone. Does this sound like I've just screwed something up in my configuration? Any pointers gratefully received

[21:43:39] <Netboy3> kour1er: i believe this is an intended functionality. with multiple clients, znc will always send/playback every new message to every client. the exceptions that don't make sense are filtered out using modules. this is why route_replies is used as it doesn't make sense to see a whois reply on a server buffer in a client that didn't send that "/msg". "/query", otoh, is a unique dialog that has its own
[21:43:40] <Netboy3> buffer and it makes sense to be sent to all clients (you can, for example start a query on one system and continue on another)
[21:44:31] <kour1er> ah right... so I guess at least I'm not doing something stupid!
[21:45:01] <Netboy3> nope, works the same way on my multi-client setup
[21:45:39] <kour1er> cool well thanks for double checking - appreciated
