[01:32:32] <Khepra> nwe: run bindeb-pkg I mean   run the makefile target,    make bindeb-pkg

[01:35:49] <celphi> k
[01:35:59] <Khepra> you needt to enable bullseye-backports in sources.list   and then just install the kernel, headers and firmware from backports
[01:36:29] <Khepra> apt install -t bullseye-backports linux-image-amd64 linux-headers-amd64 <firmware packages here>
[01:36:53] <pert> are the headers really necessary though?
[01:36:55] <Khepra> keep in mind you never want to run apt upgrade with that -t  , just install, and for specific packages
[01:37:07] <Khepra> pert: they are if dkms is involved, and it might be, all this started wtih nvidia-drivers
[01:37:26] <pert> oh yeah, forgot about the nvidia part of the discussion
[01:38:51] <towo-home> for sure, that nvidia part will fail since that is a setup with hybrid graphics
[01:39:18] <towo-home> there is no easy install with simple apt install nvidia-driver
[01:39:51] <towo-home> and btw, eben if nvidia is wantet, it would also be needed from backports, if there is the backports kernel running
[01:39:52] <Khepra> can APU's amdgpu be disabled in the bios? is theen nvidia-driver sufficient?

[09:52:57] <foul_owl> Yes indeed
[09:53:13] <Blondie101010> so you can: wget http.us.debian.org
[09:53:20] <foul_owl> Yes indeed
[09:53:35] <foul_owl> It only happens 1 out of every 3 or 4 installs
[09:53:46] <Blondie101010> well troubleshoot those that don't work
[09:54:03] <foul_owl> So I'm guessing maybe high load? I don't mind if my installs take longer or anything
[09:54:19] <Blondie101010> don't guess, look for information
[09:55:03] <Blondie101010> I doubt you'd overload your machine enough for this to be the cause
[09:55:13] <foul_owl> I mean high load on the debian mirror
[09:55:50] <Blondie101010> well try the wget repeatedly to check
[09:56:02] <Blondie101010> to me it definitely looks fine now
[09:57:24] <foul_owl> Thank you...yes I wonder what could cause an error like this besides high load on the debian servers
[09:57:42] <somiaj> maybe try deb.debian.org, the cdn is usually a better choice anyways
[09:58:01] <foul_owl> Do you know if preseed.cfg has any sort of retry count or timeout options?
[09:58:05] <foul_owl> Ahh
[09:58:24] <somiaj> I don't know enough about preeseeds, but maybe just changing the mirror will help

[19:34:31] <somiaj> well sounds like the issue is at the bootloader stage, and unsure how to debug that.

[19:40:35] <somiaj> The other option is I think you can try is use efibootmgr to create a direct link to your kernel and avoid grub.
[19:40:54] <somiaj> Outside of that, I would be unsure how to make grub load the kernel quicker or what the delay could be

[19:49:44] <amacater_> javabean - have a word with pbatard, maybe - it may be something to do with the CM4 / his UEFI
[19:50:15] <javabean> here?
[19:50:59] <somiaj> javabean: as mentioned maybe using efibootmgr to launch your kernel directly and bypass grub could help (if it is grub getting in the way vs something with the uefi of that board)
[19:51:29] <javabean> i will have to look into what that is.

[19:53:35] <somiaj> !buster su
[19:53:35] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.

[19:56:09] <somiaj> you need 'su -' so you login as root and update the enviorment including $PATH

[22:33:05] <SymbioticFemale> is there any way to release in a debian compatible manner or dual license so that code is free for all debian use/users but cannot be commercialized without compensation in any appstores (microsoft's, apple's, google's) for other operating systems (like, ios/android/windows)?
[22:35:23] <SymbioticFemale> for example, an issue with GPL is that someone who is not associated with the development of GIMP can compile it and sell it in microsoft's store for $4, so long as source is made available
[22:38:20] <Khepra> SymbioticFemale: that goes against GPL
[22:38:22] <PMT> I'm not sure that "Free as long as you don't use it in ways I dislike" is an internally consistent statement, usually.
[22:39:02] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: GPL is not the only debian compatible license
[22:39:41] <PMT> SymbioticFemale: DFSG explicitly forbids that restriction.
[22:39:47] *** Joins: smoke (~smoke@user/smoke)
[22:40:07] <Khepra> indeed. see: Redis, or mongodb's fates

[22:41:19] <PMT> At least, between the "no forbidding groups of people, fields of endeavour, or redistribution method", I think that's well covered.
[22:41:26] <Khepra> trying to monetize via restrictions is the worst possible business model. you're doomed from teh start.
[22:41:54] <Khepra> instead consider monetizing on support and additional value.
[22:42:15] <PMT> Khepra: it sounds more like they want Free and people can't go rebundle it with god knows what for a dollar on app stores.
[22:42:23] <SymbioticFemale> ^
[22:42:37] <PMT> Which is, unfortunately, as I remarked, an internally inconsistent request.
[22:42:43] <Khepra> doesn't sound like that to me.

[22:44:38] <SymbioticFemale> this is what i want to prevent
[22:44:50] <Khepra> you could try selling it for $9999.99. If you manage, kudos to you :)

[22:47:31] <SymbioticFemale> non-free repo is icky
[22:48:15] <PMT> To be clear, you should probably ask people who actually study licenses, but it seems like that restriction would probably be looked at askance.
[22:51:11] <jelly> anything with a non-commercial restriction is absolutely non-free, according to DFSG
[22:51:46] <jelly> there's nothing wrong with building free software and charging for your own builds
[22:53:38] <SymbioticFemale> ... but the non-commercial restriction is not restricting commercial use, only preventing commercial re-distribution, and only on windows/android/macos/ios, not linux/bsd.
[22:54:04] * jelly paid 10€ for a Windows 11 compatible HexChat build just recently
[22:54:22] <SymbioticFemale> jelly: ew.
[22:54:24] <PMT> Why on earth was that necessary?
[22:54:28] <jelly> it wasn't
[22:55:27] <PMT> I suppose, phrased differently, do the stock Hexchat builds not work?
[22:55:38] <jelly> what stock builds?
[22:56:07] <PMT> https://dl.hexchat.net/hexchat/HexChat%202.16.0%20x64.exe for example
[22:56:27] <Khepra> yay for spaces in URLs filenames
[22:56:31] <PMT> Hexchat isn't X-Chat, they provide Windows builds.
[22:56:53] <jelly> those are probably made by the same person as https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/p/hexchat/9nrrbgttm4j2?activetab=pivot:overviewtab
[22:57:00] <PMT> That is, yes.
[22:57:03] <SymbioticFemale> also i'm going to release free builds for ios/windows/android. i'm just trying to ensure that someone doesn't go to the UN food truck, collect all the food, then go set up shop down the street with massive advertising that makes the user fail to understand that if they just walked down the street they could get it for free.

[22:57:20] <jelly> but I like paying for software that I use regularly.
[22:57:52] <PMT> Sure, and that's fine, I just wanted to clarify whether the option of not paying would work and it was a choice or if you were paying for a build that worked when those did not.
[22:58:02] <jelly> it's always a choice
[22:58:05] <SymbioticFemale> jelly: ... are you even paying the actual devs though or just someone who re-sold it to you bundled with some spyware or in-app purchases/analytics?
[22:58:23] <Khepra> libel shots fired!
[22:59:13] <PMT> Sure, it's always a choice, I was asking about it being a choice where the other option was that it would work without friction as well.
[22:59:40] <PMT> SymbioticFemale: in this case, given that the app is linked from the HexChat site, I'm going to say it's probably fine.
[22:59:44] <jelly> SymbioticFemale, I did not ask the dev if the TingPing on MS store was them.
[23:00:26] <Khepra> I do have a question. How would this be different from companies using (but not distributing) $$ free software to make gobs of money.
[23:00:42] <Khepra> someone's making money and it ain't the original devs. so how's this different.
[23:01:35] <jelly> are you asking how is using and redistributing sw diferent?
[23:02:04] <Khepra> no. I'm asking how's trying to prevent someone selling your software for five bucks different from someone making five bucks by using your software.

[23:10:38] <SymbioticFemale> so, literally, if i want to release into debian's repos (other than non-free), i have to tolerate that it necessarily follows that then my free releases in Apple/Google/Microsoft stores can then be crowded out by better funded paid apps, which might be bundled with things that harm my users, after the rebundling devs buy advertising in those stores to get to the top of the search results.

[23:12:49] <PerfDave> If you want to release Free / Open Source Software, for most definitions thereof, that includes the freedom to use the code, reuse and bundle it, possibly in ways you don't like.
[23:13:20] <Khepra> SymbioticFemale: I think if anyone wants to bundle malware with (you) products and optionally make money on it, is absolutely not going to bother reading your license.
[23:13:22] <SymbioticFemale> no problem, i can do that, but then other people can rebundle the same app as a paid app, then use the money to advertise ---> to the top of the search results, for the exact same product
[23:13:22] <PerfDave> Copyleft requires that any code that *derives* from your work (as opposed to bundling) is under a license which affords the same freedoms to end users.
[23:13:35] <Khepra> with (*your)
