[00:04:21] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: ever since the early days of the pandemic when things got dicey for a bit for me, I've started keeping one extra thing of tp around
[00:04:34] <MootPoot> make them make a tri band wifi AP thats wifi 6E
[00:04:36] <MootPoot> or 6
[00:04:41] <ButterNoodle> #metoo TsundereNoises 
[00:05:09] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: so I always have 1 unopened 24 pack or so, and an extra one once the current one is getting low
[00:05:24] <TsundereNoises> there was one time I had to drive 2 hours for tp
[00:05:28] <TsundereNoises> never again
[00:06:30] <Fenderbassist> I respectfully suggest buying a little extra of all the usual household necessities when times are good, so that you have a stockpile for when things are bad
[00:06:40] <Fenderbassist> is what I do each shopping trip, a little extra
[00:06:45] <Fenderbassist> adds up over months
[00:07:03] <Fenderbassist> during the tp shortage, I had over 80 rolls extra on top of the 48 I keep in the bathrooms
[00:07:05] <TsundereNoises> Fenderbassist: this is why my grandmother had like 30 lbs of beans in her house when she died though
[00:07:16] <Fenderbassist> well you have to apply common sense and rotate things
[00:07:28] <Fenderbassist> but I always have 30 pounds of beans in the house
[00:07:35] <Fenderbassist> and rice
[00:07:39] <Fenderbassist> and other things
[00:07:49] <Fenderbassist> I don't think it's a bad thing
[00:07:59] <Fenderbassist> neighbor runs out of stuff, hook them up
[00:08:08] <TsundereNoises> maybe I'm underestimating, but you're not getting the scale of my grandmother
[00:08:17] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I somewhat agree, I tend to have a ton of rice
[00:08:20] <TsundereNoises> rice goes with everything
[00:08:22] <Fenderbassist> 30 pounds is like three big bags
[00:08:34] <Fenderbassist> that you buy in standard supermarkets
[00:08:42] <Fenderbassist> not the Sam Club King Kong size bag lol
[00:08:55] <TsundereNoises> I don't know how much beans weigh apparently
[00:09:02] <TsundereNoises> anyway, this is not important
[00:09:03] <Fenderbassist> no it's fine, you were expressing something
[00:09:12] <TsundereNoises> lady had a fuck ton of beans is the point
[00:09:30] <TsundereNoises> and like some of them were 20 years old
[00:09:39] <Urchin[emacs]> hi
[00:09:39] <Fenderbassist> better to have than have not, and best to rotate every x amount of months
[00:09:40] <TsundereNoises> which, to be fair, I'd eat 20 year old beans
[00:09:42] <TsundereNoises> they should be fine
[00:09:45] <Fenderbassist> hi Urchin[emacs]

[00:32:48] <TsundereNoises> not even just south america, it looks like colonization might have hit around something of a dark age, there was a much bigger east coast civilization that had broken up

[00:34:47] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: speaking of early sewers, Dubrovnik had them in 11th or 12th century (can't remember exactly right now)

[01:15:39] <Nanobot> MootPoot: My biggest jump was after I quit my previous job and started working on personal projects again. I dove into a lot of different things I hadn't really dabbled in before, and it gave me a broader perspective. More recently, I had some projects that requires me to flex in ways I haven't had to flex before. For example, for a while, I got on a big performance kick, where I started optimizing code performance and learned a lot about what makes 
[01:15:39] <Nanobot> certain operations slow/fast. And then, I started building some features that involved a lot more complexity than anything I'd done before, which required a style of architecture that I hadn't really used before. It's great to *feel* the need for new approaches rather than just doing those approaches because somebody told you to.

[01:47:11] <JesseDesu> also, they probably need to launch a few string packs once in a while
[01:47:18] <JesseDesu> and a winder and tuner
[01:47:18] <MootPoot> emmeka: would there be any possible reason why you can see a directory in linux but cant get into it, even with sudo powers
[01:47:50] <JesseDesu> i'm sure there was some scientific value of having a guitar player in space
[01:47:50] <emmeka> yes. the simplest explanation, really
[01:48:01] <emmeka> you're trying to get into it the wrong way, or it isn't a directory
[01:48:10] <MootPoot> I checked , nano tells me it is a directory
[01:48:16] <MootPoot> if I try to nano it
[01:48:32] <JesseDesu> sudo
[01:48:49] <MootPoot> sudo dont wurk
[01:48:55] <JesseDesu> you know, you can sudo <yourfavoriteGUItexteditor>
[01:49:06] <JesseDesu> i use nano featherpad
[01:49:15] <emmeka> it is true. am a pleb, and occasionally do sudo mousepad
[01:49:45] <JesseDesu> it will let you edit privilidged system configuration text files
[01:50:18] <emmeka> MootPoot I mean did you try to just cd into it first and then ls to see what's in there
[01:50:24] <JesseDesu> you have to leave the terminal in run mode tho
[01:50:41] <JesseDesu> once you close that terminal the GUI application you started will close as well

[01:56:59] <emmeka> there is no reason you shouldn't be able to cd into something, and you don't need sudo

[02:00:50] <emmeka> huh. so you see it with ls -d, but when you go "cd /etc/wireguard" nothing happens
[02:01:00] <MootPoot> yep
[02:01:07] <MootPoot> it gets me to /etc but no further

[02:16:29] <Fenderbassist> The company is a little mysterious about the source code for Amazon Linux 2. “Currently we do not have any public repos for Amazon Linux Kernel code.

[04:35:29] <MootPoot> I wonder how long the UPS will last
[04:35:29] <Fenderbassist> just be careful, redbull jacks up blood pressure
[04:35:33] <MootPoot> to keep the internet up

[04:35:49] <Satin> Fenderbassist: absolutely, and I'm not planning to do any fitness stuff 
[04:35:58] <Fenderbassist> drink that stuff slowly
[04:35:58] <MootPoot> Well, I do have a giant battery box as well so if it comes to it, I can last until tommorow
[04:36:05] <Satin> even before getting shot it used to increase my heart rate/palpations potentially
[04:36:15] <Satin> and now it triggers tremors in my hands and i become very jittery
[04:36:16] <Fenderbassist> yeah those drinks give me heart palps
[04:36:17] <MootPoot> or break out the solar panel and start charging shit
[04:36:20] <Satin> but it's fine as long as i'm not doing anything else

[05:47:21] <JesseDesu> navy seals were like, too many people use our gun of choice, time to switch it up 
[05:47:28] <ButterNoodle> not really
[05:47:36] <JesseDesu> ok i dunno
[05:47:40] <ButterNoodle> it was a cost and maintenance issue
[05:47:52] <JesseDesu> tupperware is cheap and tough
[05:47:53] <ButterNoodle> plus the mk25 but in was over some petty shit

[05:48:20] <ButterNoodle> imho a far better choice over an all metal sidearm
[05:48:46] <ButterNoodle> plus they are simple
[05:49:00] <ButterNoodle> armorers dont need to know a lot to maintain a g19
[05:49:03] <JesseDesu> sometimes i see a picture of an M4 being used in and out of a swamp
[05:49:15] <JesseDesu> does it actually fire after being submerged
[05:49:23] <ButterNoodle> at least once
[05:49:28] <Satin> i just realized
[05:49:39] <Satin> the way emmeka talsk about postmodernism and crit theory
[05:49:48] <JesseDesu> thats your trigger
[05:49:53] <Satin> like they're "things that'll rot the brain"
[05:50:05] <Satin> is very similar to how conservatives think of marx LOL
[05:50:08] <Satin> or marxist readings and what not
[05:50:14] <Satin> almost the same manner
[05:50:19] <ButterNoodle> there are a lot of un-reachable crevices on the m4 that would likely retain moisture and crud from a swamp
[05:50:31] <Satin> they treat it like a boogeyman and a disease that'll automatically rot your brain off what reality is actually
[05:50:35] <Satin> rofl
[05:50:44] <JesseDesu> satin, in my experience the philosophy you like today wont be the same as you will think in 16 years
[05:50:55] <ButterNoodle> wdym?
[05:50:59] <JesseDesu> which was how long ago i took existentialism
[05:51:04] <JesseDesu> and failed it
[05:51:07] <Satin> JesseDesu: and to me that's not really going to happen i think
[05:51:11] <Satin> it will happen for many other things
[05:51:14] <JesseDesu> lol
[05:51:17] <JesseDesu> YOU THINK NOW
[05:51:21] <Satin> but my core conception of these things isn't based around "liking them" per se or anything
[05:51:24] <JesseDesu> but i will mark those words
[05:51:40] <Satin> I am neutral, I see value in every major political philosophy school
[05:51:46] <Satin> so you're wrong about that bit
[05:51:51] <JesseDesu> ok 
[05:51:57] <JesseDesu> put it in a box and bury it
[05:52:00] <Satin> and things like the way existentalism views certain things will not go away with time for me i think
[05:52:04] <Satin> i will
[05:52:06] <JesseDesu> remember to dig it up in 16 years
[05:52:14] <Satin> certainly my overall comprhensive worldviews and estimations of what things are
[05:52:15] <Satin> will change
[05:52:17] <Satin> and keep changing
[05:52:17] <JesseDesu> also make a wish to altair and vega
[05:52:25] <JesseDesu> 16 and 25 years from now
[05:52:30] <Satin> but not my perceptions of schools of philosophy
[05:52:41] <ButterNoodle> Satin: I really dont think the conservative mindset in and of itself reflects that belief. maybe the socio/political group that call themselves conservatives
[05:52:44] <Satin> for example now, my eyes are open that the world is truly run by global capitalists from every country
[05:52:52] <Satin> ButterNoodle: yeah for sure, it's jsut my experiecne

[05:57:23] <ButterNoodle> I remember when the "SMURFS" were little blue demons and kids werent allowed to watch
[05:57:28] <Satin> he meant that to him, he came back from spending most of 19-25 irl chasing pussy or whatever
[05:57:32] <JesseDesu> dont misunderestimate
[05:57:32] <Satin> and now he comes back on the internet
[05:57:42] <Satin> and kids are toxic in vcs everywhere
[05:57:51] <JesseDesu> butternoodle what is the alternative meaning of smurf
[05:57:51] <ButterNoodle> kids are the problem
[05:57:53] <Satin> and he's like and u think that'll end up in kids that are nice irl to other people growing up?
[05:57:54] <ButterNoodle> we should eat them
[05:57:57] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: ?
[05:57:59] <Satin> social interaction online is fucked
[05:58:03] <Satin> he's right about that to an extent
[05:58:08] <Satin> i see a very nihilistic attitude
[05:58:12] <Satin> in a lot of zoomers these days
[05:58:26] <JesseDesu> if you choke a smurf what color do they turn
[05:58:28] <Satin> and a lot of principless valueless type of "baseline" asssumptions of the world, and a lot of toxic shit
[05:58:28] <Satin> but
[05:58:32] <ButterNoodle> Satin: nihilism is just a fancy word for FIDO
[05:58:36] <Satin> he's wrong to be so naive about it
[05:58:40] <Satin> that they just turn into bad
[05:58:46] <Satin> or that people can't compartmentalize their life
[05:58:58] <Satin> you can be "toxic" on the internet but have a social life etc
[05:59:02] <Satin> which he wasn't convinced by lol
[05:59:09] <Satin> and then the lines between irl and virtual blurring came up

[06:37:21] <JesseDesu> i had to stop using discord on linux because the cache and log files fill up my partition space
[06:37:50] <Satin> i use it just fine personally
[06:38:04] <JesseDesu> my partition is 12GB
[06:38:23] <JesseDesu> i didnt foresee that lubuntu would be my main workhorse OS
[06:38:46] <JesseDesu> i'm afraid to resize my partition due to potential data loss
[06:38:50] <Satin> my 1 TB SSD is divided about the same i believe between windows and linux
[06:38:59] <Satin> just backup bro
[06:40:04] <isekaijin> A 12 GB partition? What is that for? Installing Windows XP or what?
[06:40:07] <JesseDesu> i cant just backup a working OS and expect it to work when i restore it
[06:40:16] <JesseDesu> nah i was distro hopping at the time
[06:40:18] <JesseDesu> on purpose
[06:40:36] <JesseDesu> so i made my partitions rather small
[06:40:41] <isekaijin> That's what virtual machines are for.
[06:40:42] <Satin> hmmmm
[06:40:45] <JesseDesu> i didnt expect this to be my mainstay
[06:40:48] <Satin> doing project euler #1

[06:41:05] <Satin> I mean the obvious solution is that
[06:41:06] <MootPoot> But I can't check to see if it works 
[06:41:08] <MootPoot> Cuz 
[06:41:13] <Satin> i can just check each number between 0 and x
[06:41:20] <Satin> and see if it's divisible by 3 and 5
[06:41:21] <isekaijin> Virtual machines are okay for stuff that you wouldn't do on your primary computer.
[06:41:24] <Satin> but
[06:41:29] <Satin> there must be a more efficient way...
[06:41:51] <isekaijin> I use a Windows XP virtual machine for playing StarCraft, also for running old Visual Studio versions (mainly 2005 and 2008).
[06:41:52] <JesseDesu> the OS i'm on currently resides on an external hdd
[06:42:12] <Satin> isekaijin: how difficult is starcraft to get into
[06:42:31] <JesseDesu> depends if your opponent is korean 
[06:42:34] <Satin> I'm interested from a distance from a while now, i even installed it this year
[06:42:37] <Satin> JesseDesu: pfft
[06:42:42] <Satin> but i don't like the graphics THAT much
[06:42:48] <JesseDesu> thats the joke
[06:42:51] <isekaijin> Satin: It's not an easy game, that's for sure.
[06:42:53] <Satin> and yet I want a solo RTS. I currently play airmech
[06:42:55] <JesseDesu> every korean knows starcraft

[07:03:21] <isekaijin> Python is worse. Variable scope in Python is WRONG WRONG WRONG.
[07:03:27] <Satin> lmfao
[07:05:23] <isekaijin> Variable scope in Python and other scripting languages is done so horribly that IDEs have to use *heuristics* to figure out what variables might be in scope.

[07:10:46] <MootPoot> I'm not ticklish 
[07:10:50] <Terminus> saying something's bad is cult attitude. goto have to be used sparingly but there are very rare cases where they make it more readable. break is fine as well IMO.
[07:10:54] <JesseDesu> satin, did you get that link of Project MATHEMATICS!
[07:10:54] <isekaijin> Terminus: Honestly, the only annoying part of doing this in C++ is that using std::cout sucks compared to using printf.
[07:11:15] <davic> why is this channel always about programming and not about the stuff we all want to talk about

[07:12:58] <MootPoot> isekaijin: what is that abomination 
[07:13:13] <isekaijin> MootPoot: C++'s standard I/O facilities.

[08:17:58] <MootPoot> the answer is num[0]+num[1]
[08:18:06] <MootPoot> not num[0] + num[0]
[08:18:20] <MootPoot> the fact that the actual value is the same is irrelevant

[08:28:43] <klaxa> lame, i have to sign up to test my code
[08:29:47] <Satin> my code has some bug somewhere
[08:29:58] <Satin> it's not doing example 3 correctly
[08:30:39] <klaxa> i'm surprised it's not crashing
[08:30:49] <Satin>  lol
[08:31:05] <klaxa> since you're doing for (j = 4; ...) { num[j] }
[08:31:15] <klaxa> which would be after the array
[08:31:23] <klaxa> you should init with 3
[08:32:11] <Satin> oh
[08:32:34] <klaxa> also i see no reason to iterate in reverse the second time
[08:32:58] <Satin> you're right about that one
[08:33:09] <Satin> i guess i just thought it would be more efficent idk
[08:33:14] <Satin> that doesn't make sense though when i think about it
[08:33:50] <klaxa> also a more elegant way to skip the same element could be: if (i == j) { continue; }
[08:34:33] <Satin> i haven't really used the "continue" keyword before
[08:34:37] <Satin> it sounds like goto
[08:34:40] <Satin> sus
[08:34:48] <Satin> sounds very easy but
[08:35:03] <klaxa> it's super useful and i use it quite a bit
[08:35:17] <Poeticode> i like early returns
[08:35:18] <klaxa> have a special case in a loop you want to skip? just use continue
[08:35:19] <Satin> isn't it considered bad practice
[08:35:20] <Satin> or something
[08:35:31] <klaxa> i have never heard continue being bad practice ever in my life
[08:35:33] <amigojapan> Continue skips an itteration of a loop
[08:35:41] <klaxa> also goto can be used properly
[08:35:43] <Poeticode> i cant do early returns in my functional languages :(
[08:35:45] <Satin> klaxa: have you ever heard of goto or break?
[08:35:51] <Satin> being bad*
[08:35:53] <amigojapan> No continue is not bad practice
[08:35:54] <Satin> in OOP idk
[08:36:14] <klaxa> if you look at big open-source c programs many of them use gotos for error handling and memory cleanup at the end of functions
[08:36:36] <klaxa> spaghetti code is bad
[08:36:47] <klaxa> using goto excessively leads to spaghetti code
[08:36:55] <klaxa> that's why beginners are advised to avoid goto
[08:37:02] <Satin> mm yerh
[08:37:16] <klaxa> if you look at the assembler level it's gotos all the way down

[08:58:09] <Satin> yeah i see
[08:58:22] <Satin> isekaijin: also my code isn't checking for if it's using the same element or not
[08:58:35] <Satin> of an array
[08:58:39] <Satin> which is an oopsie on my part
[08:58:39] <isekaijin> Satin: Then change (j > 0) with (j > i).
[08:58:51] <Satin> hrm
[08:59:59] <isekaijin> Wait.
[09:00:15] <isekaijin> Now that I think about it, your code still contains a mistake.
[09:00:23] <isekaijin> Your code tests j = 1 through 4.
[09:00:23] <Satin> the array bounds thing?
[09:00:29] <isekaijin> But you need to test j = 0 through 3.
[09:00:33] <Satin> yeah klax a caught that one
[09:00:37] <isekaijin> Ah.
[09:00:38] <Satin> yeahhhhh
[09:02:48] <Satin> lol
[09:02:50] <Satin> can i do

[09:10:45] <isekaijin> There's nothing a priori wrong with setting a variable to -1. But if “i” will be used as an array index, it's probably best not to set it to -1.
[09:12:15] <isekaijin> An array index should be set either to a valid index (i.e., a value from 0 through size-1) or to the size of the array (there are good uses for this, even though the size of the array is actually not a valid index).
[09:15:17] <isekaijin> Also note that, in serious code, the correct type for array indices is size_t, not int.
[09:17:42] <Satin> but notthis should work

[09:24:26] <isekaijin> No idea, I don't use vim, actually.
[09:25:30] <Satin> isekaijin: j is going in reverse there so
[09:25:52] <Satin> SIZE -1 to 1
[09:26:28] <isekaijin> It's still going from SIZE to 1, not from SIZE - 1 to 1.
[09:26:42] <isekaijin> In any case, you only need j to go from i+1 to SIZE-1.
[09:26:49] <Satin> but the thing is
[09:26:57] <Satin> the j-- at the end of the for loop statement
[09:26:57] <isekaijin> Because (i,j) and (j,i) correspond to the same summands, but with the order swapped.
[09:27:06] <Satin> makes it SIZE - 1
[09:27:12] <isekaijin> Satin: The j-- runs *AFTER* the loop's body.
[09:27:19] <Satin> Oh.
[09:27:32] <Satin> How did I not know that, wtf.
[09:29:53] <Satin> I guess I either forgot that or it was a shitty assumption all this time.
[09:32:01] <Satin> isekaijin: so then the easiest fix here would be to change that j initalization to 
[09:32:05] <Satin> j = SIZE - 1;
[09:32:07] <Satin> I assume
[09:33:25] <isekaijin> Yes, and also you should change the (j > 0) to (j > i) in the inner loop's condition.
[09:33:40] <isekaijin> To avoid redundantly testing (i,j) and (j,i).

[10:14:06] <Nanobot> IRyS' second EP is out, and it still has the issue the first EP had, which is that whoever wrote the English lyrics didn't pay any attention to natural pronunciation. The words are pronounced with emphasis on all the wrong syllables, because the lyrics don't line up with how the music requires them to be phrased, and the result sounds like an amateur fan translation of a Japanese song.

[11:30:44] <Cryowolf> because it's all so redundant most of the time
[11:30:53] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: it's only idiotic if you're not getting crushed under it
[11:30:55] <Satin> ya it's pretty surface level most of the time
[11:31:01] <Satin> but it's also long drawn
[11:31:09] <Matt|home> they're all crazy Cryowolf .. 
[11:31:10] <Satin> many of these issues didn't pop up overnight or anything like that
[11:31:18] <Satin> it wasn't like there was a past where these issues didn't exist lol
[11:31:20] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], You can still shut off how you feel about it
[11:31:27] <Cryowolf> called stoicism
[11:31:31] <Matt|home> nah they've just been crawling out of the woodwork recently because of high profile politicians and a rise in authoritarianism
[11:31:34] <Matt|home> it's only gonna get worse
[11:31:39] <Cryowolf> learn it through mindfullness training
[11:31:42] <Satin> try to tell that to people directly affected by the policies and rethoric of these kind of things
[11:31:52] <Satin> stocisism isn't a very good philosophy
[11:32:10] <Satin> it has decent ideas like every other school  of thought, but this whole "shutdown how you're feeling" isn't a healthy way to live either.
[11:32:14] <Cryowolf> it's good to protect yourself until you have a plan
[11:32:14] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: go fuck yourself
[11:32:20] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: calm down
[11:32:22] <Matt|home> fun fact: if any of you wanna come to florida and feel like getting shot if you decide to take a walk at night, say the words " i support gay marriage " out loud where at least two people can hear you
[11:32:27] <Satin> it's not like they were personally attacking anyone
[11:32:34] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], what the fuck?
[11:32:41] <Satin> I disagree with their response to people suffering under such things, but they weren't personally attacking u
[11:32:42] <Matt|home> yeah that was a bit harsh
[11:32:52] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: go fuck yourself with a statuette of Marcus Aurelius, thank you very much
[11:32:56] <Matt|home> also if you wanna get eaten by an alligator take a walk at night
[11:33:03] *** Parts: Urchin[emacs] (~user@user/urchin) (ERC (IRC client for Emacs 27.1))
[11:33:09] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], fine, keep getting crushed
[11:33:11] <Satin> the fuck
[11:33:22] <Matt|home> eh i think he was just trolling or in a shitty mood
[11:33:25] <Satin> I mean, I agree with Urchin being critical of scoticisim
[11:33:27] <Satin> but
[11:33:31] <dfch> Now now, let's dial it down a notch, be civil please.
[11:33:37] <Matt|home> see im actually in a good mood
[11:33:38] <Satin> they did not need to get personal like that
[11:33:41] <Cryowolf> seems too neurotic to be stoic
[11:34:10] <Satin> stoicism isn't the answer to everything, especially when people are suffering
[11:34:17] <Matt|home> question : anyone here remotely familiar with filming?
[11:34:31] <Satin> Matt|home: ezikelnoob maybe
[11:34:37] <Satin> i can't spell his name rn
[11:34:43] <Matt|home> bleh i'll ask him later
[11:34:46] <Cryowolf> I've gone through a lot of bad shit and suffering Satin, having used stoicism....I think I have a good perspective on it

[11:34:57] <S_T_A_N> Don't Look Up
[11:34:57] <tcsilver2> yeah : )
[11:35:13] <Matt|home> i have a great idea for a show.. or comic.. but no idea what's feasible
[11:35:17] <Cryowolf> I dont always use stoicism
[11:35:19] <Satin> Cryowolf: I understand, but it's very important to understand its limitations too. And it is flawed, like many schools of philosophy.
[11:35:29] * Matt|home hifives Cryowolf 
[11:35:54] <Satin> I'm not defending urichin's actions, but you can understand how enraging it can be when someone's response to injustice and unfair political stuff is "shut it off and be stoic"
[11:35:56] <Matt|home> i get called a fencesitter 3ish times a day on average. i have mad respect for those who don't give a fuck
[11:36:00] <Cryowolf> Satin, you can choose what you let impact you in the moment and compartmentalize the rest and problem solve them later
[11:36:34] <Satin> It has valuable notions for sure to take consideration of, but there are aspects of which are terribly bad for leading a normal emotional life
[11:36:41] <Satin> negative emotions aren't bad.
[11:36:43] <Cryowolf> Satin, oh please, it's not like he said what was happening
[11:36:56] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[11:37:00] <Cryowolf> he made a general statement
[11:37:05] <Matt|home> on a scale of 1 to 10 how likely is it to get somebody who's OK in drawing to volunteer to work on a long term project? with '1' being a maybe and '10' being a yes
[11:37:09] <Satin> Cryowolf: I've already had conversations like this before with them

[11:37:25] <Satin> but you're right they didn't explicitly state it here to you
[11:37:51] <Cryowolf> Matt|home, thank you. Politically I'm "homeless". The only politics I care about is Swedens. I can talk about the US, but I don't give a shit
[11:38:12] <Cryowolf> Satin, well if they didn't, I can't know it
[11:38:15] <Matt|home> oh you will when we start nuking everyone :p i'll bet you world war III happens in the next ten years
[11:38:22] <Cryowolf> so not my problem
[11:38:43] <Satin> yeah. I don't blame you for not comphrending how it's like in the US
[11:38:50] <Matt|home> actually not joking
[11:38:52] <dfch> Just or not, have a cup a tea, chill a little bit, and have a nice discussion or don't. Name calling, telling to fuck off and being a dick to each other isn't nice and against this very channel rules. Remember: https://i.imgur.com/YbaXYAs.jpg

[11:38:56] <Satin> but trust us when we say the conservatives in this country are over the rails
[11:39:13] <Matt|home> #willdo
[11:39:13] <Satin> I live nearby a Qanon crazy dude as well
[11:39:14] <Satin> lmfao
[11:39:20] <Cryowolf> and I say it's probably a large minority at most
[11:39:24] <Satin> i see these people in real life 
[11:39:28] <Satin> it's not a minority, no
[11:39:31] <Cryowolf> just like with the left
[11:39:33] <Satin> maybe you could have made that argument a decade ago
[11:39:38] <Matt|home> between half to 2/3rds roughly
[11:39:38] <Satin> but it's not a minority anymore
[11:39:46] <Satin> in the slightest
[11:39:51] <Satin> they are everywhere. :)
[11:39:58] <Cryowolf> so you're saying the majority of liberals/progressives and conservatives are now insane idiots?
[11:40:02] <Satin> You'd have to come to the US and live here I guess
[11:40:03] <Matt|home> ... yes.
[11:40:03] <sentionics> Matt|home: so long as fascism doesn't manage to replace democracy here, things ought to be ok.
[11:40:17] <Matt|home> yes that's precisely what i'd say is accurate and correct
[11:40:19] <Cryowolf> I blame your Universities
[11:40:29] <Cryowolf> professors taught them these insane things
[11:40:37] <Satin> Cryowolf: I don't know about "insane idiots", that's not a generalization I'm comfortable with, but I can confidently make the generalization that these people are very involved, engaged, and violent even yes.
[11:40:41] <Satin> no
[11:40:43] <Matt|home> i don't think people realize just how truly stupid and incompetent people are.. like.. i thought that george carlin quote was just an exaggeration
[11:40:43] <Cryowolf> and drew a wedge between them
[11:40:46] <Matt|home> but.. it's so much worse than that
[11:40:57] <Satin> I also, as you might notice, don't take the two-sides approach here
[11:41:10] <Satin> leftists are far more correct at this time in the US than right wingers who are most of the luantics
[11:41:23] <Matt|home> if you want a fun but true generalization
[11:41:40] <Cryowolf> I wouldn't know, I've only ever talked to insane leftist social activists
[11:41:41] <Satin> this gap was bound to happen tbh in many ways, but it is, getting pretty crazy
[11:41:48] <Satin> and i see it in person
[11:41:49] <mixfix41> it happens in europe 
[11:41:58] <sentionics> Satin: absolutely agree. And, if I'm not mistaken, our version of leftism a bit closer to the rest of the world's centrism maybe?
[11:42:05] <Matt|home> the worst a left wing feminist nazi will do is yell that all male sex is rape and we need to cut everyone's dicks off. the worst a right wing nazi will do is pick up some guns ammo and explosives and start firing. and maybe get their buddies to join in.
[11:42:06] <Cryowolf> the gap happened in Sweden but it's mending now
[11:42:09] <mixfix41> i watch a documentary about how gypsies treatment in parts
[11:42:15] <Satin> sentionics: possibly
[11:42:22] <Satin> gaps aren't bad to me at all
[11:42:36] <Satin> especially when one group has insane regressive ideas
[11:42:46] <Matt|home> oh you know what anime i watched from a long ass time ago and forgot how much i despised the main character?
[11:42:53] <Matt|home> fucking sword art online :D god that's an old show
[11:42:54] <Satin> I want leftist ideas to win, they are better and far more on track for a better society in this country
[11:43:03] <Matt|home> what a great premise.. ruined by a terrible MC
[11:43:04] <Satin> conservativism is a huge cope 
[11:43:17] <dfch> tfw SAO is an old show
[11:43:23] <dfch> man, I'm old :|
[11:43:34] <Matt|home> dfch : yeah did you remember how much of a selfish evil fucking bastard the MC was??
[11:43:41] <Matt|home> like why the hell would they make him the focus of the show
[11:43:44] <Satin> and I'm not out of touch or anything, I engage with these people in real life in person, my family is like that, i talk to people on discord and engage in political servers and what not
[11:43:46] <dfch> Matt|home, didn't like him at all
[11:43:47] <Cryowolf> I think it's funny how everything went back to status quo when Biden won and he didn't fullfil many of his promises at all
[11:43:52] <Satin> I know both sides of the coin here
[11:44:05] <S_T_A_N> I keep getting older and the JKs stay the same
[11:44:06] <Satin> oh many people are upset with biden, and progressives are holding their demands straight as well
[11:44:08] <Cryowolf> and he's continuing all the bad things every other President ever did
[11:44:12] <Satin> S_T_A_N: jijisotnarestrienarst
[11:44:13] <Satin> LOL
[11:44:18] <Matt|home> ... biden is a slightly more intelligent version of trump, and holy shiiiiiiit do people (myself included) hate him
[11:44:29] <Matt|home> he's not going to survive another term
[11:44:30] <Matt|home> at all
[11:44:32] <Cryowolf> no he isn't. Not anymore anyway
[11:44:32] <Satin> I would not say he's continuing all the bad things that every other President did, yes he's not the best president or anything
[11:44:40] <Satin> but he has made good moves
[11:44:41] <Satin> as well
[11:44:46] <Cryowolf> He's demented, literally
[11:44:51] <Satin> I don't buy that
[11:44:57] <Satin> people say all of that, but his actions are concrete
[11:45:11] <Cryowolf> you sure he's the one deciding on them?
[11:45:18] <Cryowolf> or just the one reading a speech?
[11:45:21] <Matt|home> people don't seem to realize that US presidents have far more sway over foreign policies than domestic affairs. you guys do realize that congress dictates 99% of all political action inside the US right?
[11:45:23] <Satin> I'm not sure about that really
[11:45:36] <Satin> but he rarely makes slipups since he became president
[11:45:36] <Cryowolf> Matt|home, I know that...and I'm Swedish
[11:45:58] <S_T_A_N> He doesn't fullfill his campain promises(then again who does) and he refuses to take even the most basic actions within his to address the needs of the country. He is an utter failure and men like him are why Democrats keep losing 
[11:45:59] <dfch> Most people outside of US do know that :)
[11:46:07] <dfch> I think
[11:46:07] <Cryowolf> Federal power is very restricted domestically because of state autonomy rights
[11:46:17] <Matt|home> no he just lies through his fucking teeth. he accomplished his long standing goal of the afghan pullout and can now notch that on his goddamn belt, mission accomplished
[11:46:27] <Satin> steps like appointing Lina Khan to the chairman of the FTC, steps like the build back better bill etc
[11:46:30] <Satin> i wouldn't be that cynical
[11:46:38] <Satin> he's not very succesful at getting that legislation passed
[11:46:44] <Satin> thanks to two very uh, stubborn senators
[11:46:49] <Cryowolf> yes....and everything is back to how it was before Bush sent everyone there Matt|home. Only took a few weeks
[11:46:57] <Satin> but this idea that biden's done nothing or made very glaringly bad moves (excluding the afghanistan thing)
[11:46:59] <S_T_A_N> Matt|home: you mean the pullout planned under trump(bunt granted exeacuted under biden)
[11:47:09] <Satin> is wrong
[11:47:21] <Matt|home> yeah. you can blame him and the top brass for that. do you have any idea how many soldiers are now staring at him and the higher ups with fucking murderous rage?
[11:47:36] <Cryowolf> Matt|home, sounds like Vietnam
[11:47:40] <Matt|home> twenty goddamn years down the shitter despite them telling washington constantly that you can't treat afghanistan as a single nation
[11:47:58] <S_T_A_N> Satin: sure he has done.... things.... were they the things that were promised? no. The things that were needed? No. 
[11:48:06] <dfch> Matt|home, what about Tsuboi Ryotarou?
[11:48:27] <Matt|home> fucking marine friend of mine who was literally first boots on the ground had to go to therapy because some families he saved got fucking murdered because of that
[11:48:44] <Cryowolf> saying Trump did nothing good is just as foolish as saying Biden is doing nothing good. But the rest they do is probably really horrible, or hilarious
[11:48:57] <dfch> aka クライン
[11:49:05] <Matt|home> dfch : i only watched episode 1 and half of 2 before i remembered why i hated it
[11:49:07] <Satin> S_T_A_N: he *did* show effort
[11:49:13] <Satin> S_T_A_N: blame manchin and sinema
[11:49:14] <Matt|home> god.. the death scenes in that show are fucking horrific
[11:49:23] <Satin> obviously the democrats are incompetent in the end here for not passing this shit
[11:49:25] <Matt|home> we get a cute little pixelated animation of them poofing into the air
[11:49:28] <Cryowolf> what show?
[11:49:32] <Matt|home> sword art online
[11:49:33] <Satin> it's a betrayal to all of those volunteers
[11:49:35] <Cryowolf> oh
[11:49:36] <dfch> Matt|home. oic, well I honestly think you missed out much
[11:49:40] <dfch> Cryowolf, sao
[11:49:47] <Cryowolf> I only like the bullet arc in SAO
[11:50:04] <Cryowolf> the rest sucks
[11:50:09] <Matt|home> i like how everyone completely forgot the fact that there were women and children too who probably died day 1 or 2
[11:50:18] <S_T_A_N> Satin: he can take action on student debt leagally without congress. He absolutely refuses to because he's a goddamn lier and he thinks he can hide behind Manchin. 
[11:50:41] <S_T_A_N> Bullet arc was great SAO
[11:51:02] <S_T_A_N> Aliceization was also great SAO, except the parts with Asuna 
[11:51:31] <Cryowolf> I think the fact that the US electoral College members can decide to go against their county/state votes and put their vote on the other guy. But they have to resign immediately after
[11:51:34] <Cryowolf> is
[11:51:38] <Cryowolf> wtf?
[11:52:21] <Satin> S_T_A_N: not sure if it's legal but you're probably right
[11:52:32] <Satin> Cryowolf: that rarely ever happens though
[11:52:33] <S_T_A_N> What the CDC is doing, presumeably under his direction right now is applaing. The messageing his team uses about the pandemic, student debt, is so demented and evil
[11:52:39] <Cryowolf> Like, if they can do that, there's always the risk that your vote means nothing
[11:52:44] <Cryowolf> Satin, it shouldnt happen at all
[11:52:56] <Satin> it shouldn't yeah, but it's not really a "problem" currently
[11:52:59] <S_T_A_N> Satin: it will get challenged to hell and high water but it would hold up\
[11:53:14] <Matt|home> <Cryowolf> I think the fact that the US electoral College members can decide to go against their county/state votes and put their vote on the other guy. But they have to resign immediately after <-- the one or two times in history that's happened it didn't affect the vote
[11:53:16] <Satin> S_T_A_N: hmmm i see
[11:53:18] <Matt|home> it's a non issue basically
[11:53:22] <Satin> yeah it's a non-issue
[11:53:23] <Cryowolf> the president trying to wipe student debt can easily be overturned by Congress and the Supreme Court
[11:53:29] <Matt|home> BUT
[11:53:37] <Satin> Cryowolf: both of which are unlikely to happen
[11:53:52] <Matt|home> i still think the entire election system is fucking crazy. there's only one goddamn reason why the president isn't elected by a simple majority-wide country vote
[11:53:53] <Cryowolf> it's not a non issue when the possibility exists
[11:54:01] <Matt|home> and it's because it'd be a democratic president every single fucking time
[11:54:04] <Satin> it is a non issue because it almost never happens
[11:54:12] <Satin> i agree we should eliminate the possibility at some point
[11:54:19] <Satin> but it's not really a threat at all
[11:54:27] <Satin> or a pressing matter compared to so  many other things
[11:54:40] <S_T_A_N> easily is an over statement, and the law backs him up to have the power. if the SC rules agsinst it we know the country is already 100% lost to reason and following the rule of law
[11:54:42] <Cryowolf> Matt|home, no it's because most people live on the coast and you'd have 5 states or whatnot deciding on the whole country, including places theyve never been
[11:54:42] <Matt|home> here. you wanna know what happens if the EC rebels? they'd be sanctioned and thrown in prison. the election would resume, and we'd abide by what they voted. then the entire EC system would be scrapped forever
[11:55:00] <Matt|home> that's actually what would happen
[11:55:26] <S_T_A_N> Matt|home: no it would not. the EC system would stand but just remove the human element from it
[11:55:39] <S_T_A_N> Actually removing the EC system would be popular vote or soemthing
[11:55:44] <Satin> anyways, going to go try to do some more programming bbl
[11:55:47] <Matt|home> o\
[11:55:50] <Matt|home> tv ^^
[11:56:01] <Cryowolf> I need to do more world building for my novel
[11:56:17] <Cryowolf> it's tedious to write down the details of my thoughts and what I've already figured out
[11:56:24] <Cryowolf> but it has to be done
[11:56:28] <S_T_A_N> Cryowolf: farm boy rises up and siezes the means of production 
[11:56:57] <Cryowolf> then the guys with guns and lack of guilt and remorse come and steal it
[11:57:05] <Cryowolf> perhaps keep the farm boy to farm
[11:57:19] <Cryowolf> in the apocalypse
[11:57:23] <Cryowolf> of course
[11:58:03] <sentionics> It's 3.05 C (37 F) outside. But it still feels hot inside. Can't wait for this booster shot's side effects to wear off.
[11:58:15] <sentionics> Was doing better, slept this evening, woke up, fucked up.
[11:58:39] <S_T_A_N> so next booster when
[11:58:44] <sentionics> Seems like after an hour or so ibuprofen actually does start to help (that and not laying down)
[11:58:56] <Cryowolf> combine it with paracetamol
[11:59:18] <Cryowolf> or well no
[11:59:21] <Cryowolf> actually dont
[11:59:25] <Cryowolf> not with your liver
[11:59:25] <sentionics> S_T_A_N: I'm guessing if I take another shot, it may be if they get that omicron specific vaccine ready.
[11:59:46] <sentionics> Cryowolf, right, lol. I hardly ever use tylenol.
[12:00:15] <sentionics> though, I don't think my liver is in dire straits yet, but with my binges, who knows how long that'll remain the case.
[12:00:19] <Cryowolf> after omicron there will be another strain. As long as theres no more version as deadly as the first, we've now almost approached regular flu or cold numbers
[12:00:35] <Cryowolf> have you tested your liver enzymes?
[12:00:37] <sentionics> The liver is supposed to heal pretty fast if you just stop giving it shit it struggles with for a while.
[12:01:04] <Cryowolf> It can only heal so much, you can end up with scar tissue all over it, which is really bad
[12:01:32] <sentionics> Cryowolf, my extreme hangover visits to the ER (after week long benders), they do show rough-ish numbers, but go back down once I clear up.
[12:01:39] <sentionics> *after a few days of sobriety
[12:02:47] <Cryowolf> sentionics, get some Liv52 supplement
[12:03:08] <sentionics> basically, every now and then, I find myself at the ER over it, they prescribe me benzos. I use the benzos only on the day of coming down subsequent benders to save from an ER trip, then eventually the benders burn out my benzo supply and it's back to the ER. A gross cycle.

[12:06:35] <sentionics> Cryowolf: thanks for the supplement mention. I only really trust basic supplements, tbh though (I use vitamin B1 and Folate in particular after binges, as alcohol definitely depletes your B vitamins).
[12:07:04] <Cryowolf> it's a good one though, there's one for kidneys called cystone. They might have changed names recently

[12:07:45] <sentionics> I've actually experienced the beginnings of alcoholic neuropathy in the past, but no longer experience that since I've been supplementing B1 and folate.
[12:07:58] <Cryowolf> though that first one is out of stock so liv52 works
[12:08:03] <Cryowolf> damn
[12:08:05] <sentionics> and also eating more throughout my benders. I used to go crazy days without eating at all.
[12:08:25] <Cryowolf> well liv52 and Cystone are my recommendations to protect your liver until you decide enough is enough and go sober
[12:08:44] <Cryowolf> So you stay alive to be able to make that choice
[12:08:55] <Cryowolf> cause I dont want to see you dead dude
[12:09:42] <sentionics> Cryowolf: thanks, mate. Yeah, I'm trying to figure it out. Seem to be getting no where at times, but I still feel like maybe I can come up with some kind of breakthrough somehow and finally get truly clean from it for good.
[12:10:15] <S_T_A_N> anyone have any good, hopeful news?
[12:10:35] <Cryowolf> Speaking as a former addict of opium (yes actual opium), quitting came once I realized how much I hate myself and after I sleepwalked dangerously
[12:10:53] <Cryowolf> and kept losing consciousness randomly, even on my feet
[12:11:09] <S_T_A_N> I just found this and now feel so empty https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/rxwnbl/i_am_a_new_york_city_public_high_school_student/

[12:11:12] <sentionics> I've tried AA and outpatient rehab in the past, but I hate AA and outpatient rehab is hard to stay committed to (I still kept going on benders while I was going there, didn't really feel it was helping me).
[12:11:18] <Cryowolf> S_T_A_N, I do...I'm still alive and thus far cancer free
[12:11:46] <Cryowolf> AA etc doesnt help, 95% of all who go there rebound
[12:12:13] <Cryowolf> but you have to find a reason for quitting that is important and then find something to fill that void you've made, or had to begin with
[12:12:20] <Cryowolf> replace alcohol with something else

[12:14:50] <amigojapan> Hi. Seems tomako may have ruptured her mucus membrane again :(
[12:15:02] <sentionics> Cryowolf: yeah, I recently started back learning new stuff (TypeScript, and Svelte I've been on and off with), but I feel like coding for work kinda had me completely forgetting how much I actually enjoy coding my own ideas, reaching my own goals.
[12:15:44] <Cryowolf> nice
[12:16:00] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, that sucks :< does she need surgery?
[12:16:07] <sentionics> Guess it's kinda like I'd forgotten that to call oneself a programmer, well, one ought to program. Sort of like how an artist ought to make art. I feel like I'm on my way back to the path I wanted to be on in the first place when I got into this field.
[12:16:18] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yeah I think so
[12:17:12] <sentionics> amigojapan: oh damn, dude. Sorry to hear that.
[12:17:33] <amigojapan> sentionics: it's a simple surgery
[12:18:39] <sentionics> Ruptured mucus membrane sounds like freaky stuff. Of course, anything requiring surgery is freaky to begin with. I couldn't be a doctor.
[12:19:05] <sentionics> (also, lazy people like me probably shouldn't be doctors anyway, :P )
[12:19:26] <sentionics> I'd never make it on their sleep schedules.
[12:20:29] <Cryowolf> I used to think that stuff was disgusting but after my major surgery and all the disgusting things I had to go through after, I've become desensitized to a lot of it. Especially if it's done on me

[12:31:00] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: tomako wants to wait and see if the boys stops. Especially since the closest hospital already rejected us cause they have no ear nose and throat specialist at night. Finding one will be a nightmare
[12:31:20] <sentionics> I enjoyed the episodes, except I hated the way the finale episode went. I want say the season was utterly ruined by the final episode, but that was a shit way to end it.
[12:31:30] <Cryowolf> There's no ER you can go to amigojapan?
[12:32:10] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: ERs don't just take anyone
[12:32:52] <Cryowolf> depends on severity
[12:33:04] <Cryowolf> a nurse would need to examine it to decide that

[12:42:49] <Cryowolf> how odd....what happens if you have an emergency?
[12:42:55] <Cryowolf> I mean...they send ambulances right?

[12:44:00] <Cryowolf> don't stuff anything in the nose though
[12:44:11] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yeah they send ambulances, but often they won't come for stuff like this

[12:46:38] <sentionics> whoa, that's awful. I feel like if you were triaged for something like that at one of our ER's they'd at least give you a bed and have some nurses and docs look at you.
[12:47:08] <sentionics> Of course, you'll be charged out the ass for it though (unless you're poor enough to have medicaid).
[12:47:46] <amigojapan> sentionics: yeah, money is not the issue in Japan
[12:47:47] <sentionics> well, medicaid, I don't really know what all it covers, but it covers my hangover ER trips.
[12:48:18] <sentionics> (they're forced to though, as alcohol withdrawal can actually kill)
[12:49:58] <sentionics> since the pandemic started, if you had medicaid, no matter what job you landed, you pretty much kept your coverage regardless of income changes. With my last two jobs, I was like, I'm making kickass salary, but they're not dropping me after reporting it.

[14:51:18] <zoidberg> Satin: I did up to 16
[14:51:22] <Satin> ooh
[14:51:30] <zoidberg> then my math broke
[14:51:34] <Satin> these are kind of addicting
[14:51:35] <zoidberg> lol
[14:51:41] <Satin> for now at least
[14:51:55] <Satin> I'm also learning vim at the same time
[14:52:03] <zoidberg> are you hardcoding the solutions or using math?
[14:52:09] <Satin> hardcoding as in?
[14:52:13] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o amigojapan
[14:52:19] <zoidberg> I mean brute force
[14:52:34] <Satin> Yes I'm using bruteforce for some of these
[14:52:44] <Satin> I don't know fancy math related to sequences for the first one
[14:52:50] <Satin> and the fibbonci number stuff...?
[14:52:56] <Satin> that's just sums 
[14:53:01] <zoidberg> yeah
[14:53:06] <Satin> so there was no extra math foruma to know
[14:53:08] <Satin> formula*
[14:53:10] <Satin> as far as i know
[14:53:17] <Satin> i posted my solution in the screenshot above
[14:53:20] <zoidberg> I did them in common lisp and python
[14:53:26] <Satin> ew
[14:53:29] <Satin> ew python*
[14:53:35] <Satin> lisp ounds interesting
[14:54:02] <zoidberg> you know it's silly to have any prejudice against programming languages
[14:54:08] * Satin no
[14:54:35] <Satin> People dislike C and I like C
[14:54:44] <amigojapan> Zoidberg as far as you are not forced to use anyone you don't like, just ignore it I guess
[14:55:05] <zoidberg> yeah, lisp is interesting, one of a kind
[14:55:06] <amigojapan> Satin: you don't know enough C to dislike it
[14:55:18] <Satin> oh? how much C do I need to know now to dislike it
[14:55:37] <amigojapan> Satin: buffer overflow attack solutions
[14:55:37] <Satin> zoidberg: I read the first few chapters of structure and intrep
[14:55:48] <zoidberg> amigojapan: for most people in IT, they are forced to use the tools and languages
[14:55:49] <Satin> amigojapan: I'm aware it has issues like that, doesn't make me dislike it though
[14:55:55] <zoidberg> they hardly get any choice
[14:56:31] <zoidberg> nice Satin, that's more about programming concepts than language. It uses scheme though.
[14:56:42] <Satin> ik

[14:58:57] <Satin> uh huh
[14:59:01] <Satin> yeah okay
[14:59:01] <zoidberg> and the way you learn it is fun too Satin. Like you don't need to write the complete program and bash your head for errors. You can compile at each line or for each function/macro
[14:59:15] <Satin> zoidberg: i see
[14:59:48] <zoidberg> I had fun learning lisp
[15:00:14] <zoidberg> and also ##lisp is quite active community
[15:00:34] <wow8amazing454> hello zoidberg
[15:01:22] <zoidberg> I forgot which one is for common lisp. one of #lisp, ##lisp is exclusive for common lisp and another for all lisp languages

[15:02:00] <Satin> how is prime factorization usually done in programming
[15:02:08] <zoidberg> hello wow8amazing454 
[15:02:08] <Satin> is it just using the same divisibility tricks
[15:02:16] <Satin> that u learn in school
[15:02:22] <zoidberg> Satin: don't ask, figure it out on your own
[15:02:25] <zoidberg> experiment
[15:02:34] <Satin> zoidberg: I don't waste time with things like this
[15:02:50] <Satin> too much isolation is inefficent and pointless
[15:02:55] <zoidberg> you're taking the fun out
[15:03:05] <Satin> that's not how I find fun in it :P
[15:03:18] <Satin> my fun is implementing it throughly, my question isn't asking for the solution
[15:03:25] <Satin> it's a generalized question with regards to approaches
[15:03:41] <Satin> if the approach is commonly to use middle school prime factorization techniques
[15:03:54] <Satin> or if there's computer-specific programming means that are used generally
[15:04:33] <zoidberg> I am looking at how I did
[15:05:15] <Satin> I guess I should assume the former
[15:07:11] <zoidberg> found it
[15:07:37] <zoidberg> I did it the same way as we learned in school
[15:07:43] <zoidberg> Satin: ^^
[15:07:53] <Satin> kk got ha
[15:07:54] <Satin> gotcha

[15:10:03] <zoidberg> which ones amigojapan?
[15:10:36] <amigojapan> Zoidberg kageki shoujo I heard is like an old school shoujo anime
[15:11:00] <zoidberg> it's good
[15:11:04] <amigojapan> Zoidberg and I liked the first season of mushoku tensei
[15:11:35] <zoidberg> that's odd amigojapan 
[15:11:41] <amigojapan> Why
[15:12:11] <zoidberg> it's not your kind of anime
[15:12:44] <amigojapan> Zoidberg you don't seem to get what is my kid kind of anime all the time
[15:12:58] <amigojapan> Kind*
[15:13:31] <zoidberg> isn't mushokou tensei isekai shonen like anime?
[15:13:35] <amigojapan> Zoidberg I like many kinds of anime
[15:14:07] <amigojapan> Zoidberg it's seinen
[15:14:49] <zoidberg> I know but these days I thought you wouldn't watch those kind of anime. You know the one with fantasy elements, fights and such..
[15:15:14] <zoidberg> I haven't seen mushokou tensei amigojapan 
[15:15:25] <amigojapan> Zoidberg I specifically liked the part about learning magic
[15:16:04] <zoidberg> amigojapan: coincidentally my writing is similar to that
[15:16:15] <zoidberg> at least that's what I heard
[15:16:55] <zoidberg> it wasn't my intention though
[15:16:55] <amigojapan> Zoidberg he is born like a baby and takes advantage of his memory to learn magic

[15:21:17] <zoidberg> amigojapan: Then he plays around with mana, collides them to form different kind of mana and such
[15:21:55] <amigojapan> I see zoidberg it does sound similar. Maybe you should watch it
[15:22:22] <zoidberg> nah amigojapan, if I watch then my ideas, thoughts would be corrupted
[15:22:33] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:24:13] <zoidberg> so this new person says, he's not bad
[15:24:38] <zoidberg> I'd say that's the human condition amigojapan.

[15:27:24] <zoidberg> I don't know. I am just saying on, "I'm not bad"
[15:27:49] <amigojapan> Zoidberg I will keep my eye on him

[15:29:02] <amigojapan> Right
[15:30:04] <zoidberg> I told that many times amigojapan but they keep changing it. I think it's because ##anime is not foss community so maybe the libera or the ops here want to keep it open for everyone.

[16:31:06] <Sadale> even after using sex toys I'm still a proud virgin :3
[16:31:07] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it's a very weird show, for something in that genre
[16:31:25] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I want to say it reminds me of utena in a way, which it does, but I worry that'd give you the wrong impression
[16:31:45] <TsundereNoises> both are weird, but different kinds of weird, I mean that only in a more abstract way
[16:31:49] <amigojapan> I liked utena TsundereNoises 
[16:31:53] <TsundereNoises> so did I
[16:32:01] <TsundereNoises> I LOVED Utena
[16:32:22] <amigojapan> 90s anime was the best
[16:32:29] <TsundereNoises> hard disagree
[16:32:35] <TsundereNoises> but there was some great anime in the 90s
[16:33:20] <TsundereNoises> just people don't give the modern stuff enough credit
[16:33:30] <TsundereNoises> and they forget all the generic garbage from the past
[16:33:42] <TsundereNoises> there has always been generic garbage shows no one will remember, we just forget the old ones!
[16:33:54] <amigojapan> Modern anime will have few classics
[16:33:58] <TsundereNoises> have always*
[16:34:11] <TsundereNoises> there are just as many if not more classics now
[16:34:18] <ezekielnoob> Sadale there's ways to try
[16:34:19] <TsundereNoises> but people don't give them a chance
[16:34:31] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, NO. I'd rather to stay virgin :3
[16:34:33] <TsundereNoises> I don't think the best anime and the most popular anime on reddit overlap as much as people would like to think
[16:34:35] <ezekielnoob> tho it's probably a special feeling losing it to someone you really love

[16:58:21] <TsundereNoises> which is why you get some weird shit with Arthur Conan Doyle
[16:58:41] <TsundereNoises> the Doyle estate are litigious assholes who have lost in court a few times at this point by the way

[17:26:20] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: they should teach it in school
[17:26:23] <TsundereNoises> lastonestanding: we had a bit of cooking in school here in the USA, but I learned mostly from my family
[17:26:53] <lastonestanding> I think that we baked a cake in school
[17:27:12] <zoidberg> cooking? in school? huh
[17:27:33] <lastonestanding> it's an essential skill
[17:27:36] <amigojapan> Yeah useful for life zoidberg
[17:27:43] <TsundereNoises> in 6th-8th grade we had a basic "make cookies, don't stick your hand in the 350 degree oven" in high school there was an optional class about 50% of the school took where you made actual meals
[17:28:22] <zoidberg> In schools here, we usually prepare for competitive exams to get into good Uni.
[17:28:28] <TsundereNoises> you didn't have to take it, but you could and like most people did, it was a fun class
[17:28:39] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: it's not either or
[17:28:57] <zoidberg> amigojapan: all that grinding and I got 20,000 rank

[17:29:26] <JesseDesu__> i got an A+ in ceramics
[17:29:40] <TsundereNoises> that's why a high school class is helpful, get the basics down
[17:29:46] <nekobit> hell yeah man i have had oatmeal this morning
[17:30:09] <TsundereNoises> I think the best skill I learned from a class was how to chop a fucking onion, and I use that skill daily
[17:30:23] <lastonestanding> the result has to be yummy
[17:30:36] <zoidberg> it takes practice but yeah, cooking is not hard
[17:30:54] <lastonestanding> it is time consuming though

[18:34:56] <TsundereNoises> like that's not how cold it is in your car before you turn the heater on, that's not how cold it is when you get the building between you and the wind
[18:35:41] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: exactly, too fucking cold is a helpful scientific term
[18:35:44] <TsundereNoises> no one is confused
[18:36:02] <TsundereNoises> it's a bit colder than regular fucking cold, which is more than cold as balls
[18:36:49] <`Zephyr> As a person who has never lived in a place that actually gets cold by the definition of anyone who has lived in cold places: do cars get colder than their ambient temperature like they do get hotter than their ambient temperature on a summer afternoon? 
[18:37:05] <`Zephyr> I am guessing not, but I felt I should check.
[18:37:40] <TsundereNoises> `Zephyr: no, generally cars are a bit warmer during the day

[18:38:18] <TsundereNoises> and you fucking notice it when the car is very cold
[18:38:45] <TsundereNoises> but no, cars are relatively air-tight, so if you've had it running they tend to be a smidge warmer than the surroundings

[21:48:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Good content.
[21:51:00] <DPA> Are there any animes with programming-like magic systems as a main mechanic? Like, one may have a grimoire/module with basic spells/functions, like getRealObject(), and can then write stuff on a paper
[21:51:01] <DPA> like "freezeMyBox { box=getRealObject('MyBox'); foreach(atom in box){ setRelativeVelocity(atom, getNearestAtom(atom), velocity=>velocity/2); }", and later just says "freezeMyBox" or something, and the thing with MyBox written on it is suddenly frozen?
[21:51:01] <DPA> It doesn't have to be actual code. Something scratch like or some other ways to represent & combine processes is fine too. Or just whatever comes closest to this.
[21:51:33] <MootPoot> there is that rettosei one but dont expect any anime to actually explore that kind of thing

[22:18:29] <Jigsy> The burden of proof is on the state, not the defense.
[22:18:37] <MootPoot> but anyway, the judge did say
[22:18:38] <emmeka> even better
[22:18:39] <MootPoot> >Provincial Court Judge Donna Groves noted there were no children actually sexually abused in the child pornography in the case, but said the offence is still serious and it was aggravating that he had more than 2,000 images.
[22:18:48] <emmeka> you'd get the prosecutor to have to read loli doujins
[22:18:50] <Jigsy> The defendent doesn't need to prove they're innocent.
[22:18:53] <MootPoot> emmeka: LOL
[22:19:04] <Jigsy> Only 2,000?
[22:19:05] <Jigsy> Weak.
[22:19:11] <isekaijin> Loli hentai is absolutely disgusting, but why would a damn drawing be grounds for sending anyone to jail?
[22:19:21] <MootPoot> well, he only got like 6 months for it
[22:19:27] <MootPoot> probably got out in 3
[22:19:49] <MootPoot> but if it was actual CP he would be in for like 3-4 years most likely
[22:19:53] <emmeka> yeah but then you have a sex offender rap sheet and are fucked forever
[22:19:53] <mixfix41> because the nipple are redder they jelly
[22:19:58] <emmeka> that doesn't go away with a pardon

[22:21:13] <isekaijin> That being said, in a sense, it's a public service to make it known that someone is a consumer of loli hentai, to avoid doing any kind of business with them.
[22:21:14] <emmeka> there's a registry. if you do police record checks, it checks two things: the national criminal records, and the sex offender registry
[22:21:36] <emmeka> isekaijin and yet here you are, in ##anime
[22:21:58] <MootPoot> but why?
[22:22:07] <MootPoot> you'd already be in the national criminal records
[22:22:15] <emmeka> because the latter is not erased by a pardon
[22:22:32] <MootPoot> do people even get pardons?
[22:22:34] <emmeka> yes?
[22:22:40] <MootPoot> TIL
[22:22:41] <emmeka> it's relatively trivial to do
[22:22:53] <MootPoot> I thought pardons were like some super rare thing only trudau could give
[22:23:38] <emmeka> no, you apply for them. if after a certain amount of time after getting out of prison you don't re-offend, you can just apply, and your criminal record is destroyed

[22:25:21] <MootPoot> it seems like they recognize its fictional

[22:25:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Otherwise let's also start banning gays from buying groceries or power right?
[22:26:04] <emmeka> MootPoot one of the many things Harper was an asshole about. The waiting times used to be 3 years for minor offences after your sentence, and 5 years for major crimes
[22:26:15] <emmeka> they increased it to 5 for minor crimes and 10 for major
[22:26:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh but suddenly that's not okay. Almost as if basic essentials & human rights should actually be a thing (protip; they should).
[22:26:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Harper was pro-corporate scum.

[22:28:27] <MootPoot> slightly?
[22:28:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Australia has worse cryptography/privacy laws than Canada from my readings.
[22:28:31] <MootPoot> you mean very
[22:28:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You cannot get imprisoned for refusing to incriminate yourself in Canada.

[22:30:25] <Sapphirus> Served 1-year in prison
[22:30:26] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose yeah we have a constitutional clause about self-incrimination

[22:30:38] <MootPoot> not muricans
[22:30:49] <MootPoot> border guards are forever cringe
[22:31:13] <Sapphirus> Yes, but I don't find what you're saying to be believable, given they'd imprison an American tourist
[22:32:03] <MootPoot> it was done under considering
[22:32:07] <Sapphirus> Doesn't matter what type of foreign national you are, they'll arrest you at the border for bringing it in.
[22:32:09] <MootPoot> consideration - he was caught
[22:32:19] <Sapphirus> And if they don't, the law isn't being applied.
[22:32:24] <MootPoot> but they made a statement about how we understand that its legal there and etc
[22:32:37] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: our law is very context based, not black and white 
[22:33:01] <mixfix41> a lot of losers in government 
[22:33:34] <Sapphirus> It's also not illegal in America, so MootPoot, I don't believe it necessarily.
[22:33:34] <Poeticode> australia likes to look at the USA/UK and think "damn those are some good ideas"
[22:33:47] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: its state dependant
[22:34:06] <MootPoot> not every US state is the same on the matter
[22:34:06] <Jigsy> I live in the UK and managed to import loli dakis from time to time.
[22:34:08] <mixfix41> you gotta be like lara croft dodging it
[22:34:17] <Jigsy> I'm hoping I'm on a list somewhere.
[22:34:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You are.
[22:34:33] <Sapphirus> But it is not a federal crime where as it is here.
[22:34:36] <Jigsy> I better be.
[22:34:41] <Jigsy> I'll be disappointed if I'm not.
[22:34:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The safest way to get them is to effectively buy the equipment to make the print yourself.
[22:35:07] <MootPoot> only buy chinese equipment so the NSA cant spy on you
[22:35:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Much like the safest way to buy guns here is to buy a CNC...
[22:35:10] <emmeka> I mean let's be real here, tens of thousands of dollars of loli doujins probably cross the border into this country a year and few of these people get fucked with

[22:35:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Far more if you count digital traffic.
[22:36:05] <Jigsy> Importing dakimakura covers is just human trafficking.
[22:36:09] <Jigsy> Yeah, wrap your head around that.
[22:36:20] <MootPoot> notice that the majority of the stories just dont even say they were caught by like online tracking or something like they catch actuap CP
[22:36:25] <MootPoot> its just people getting reported by others
[22:37:03] <mixfix41> also just having a gun to cap the scooter gang members is important then worry about serial and gun possession if it ever comes to being in the projects

[22:40:40] <mixfix41> people will troll you with level of intellect i think thats much ruder
[22:41:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> so yeah, ENF effectively means that any country with electrical providers who bother to record frequency shifts will enable finding CP producers who don't specifically take precautions against it the moment that their origin country is identified.
[22:41:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or perhaps even if it isn't identified, if you have access to a sufficiently large dataset.
[22:41:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And by precautions I mean you effectively have to go entirely offgrid.
[22:41:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Use battery or generator power.
[22:42:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Or use medical-grade UPSes, I guess)

[22:44:56] <MootPoot> I mean more like you charge it up, and then unplug it from the wall
[22:45:04] <MootPoot> and use it from battery power only
[22:45:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That is "on battery power"
[22:45:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which I noted above.
[22:45:40] <MootPoot> I dont follow
[22:45:58] <MootPoot> the power from the battery is the same harmonics at the power used to charge it?
[22:46:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I'm saying that unless you unplug the UPS, there will be resultant noise from the mains frequencies.
[22:46:31] <MootPoot> yeah- that's what I meant before
[22:46:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And medical-grade UPSes filter that out even when plugged in.
[22:46:43] <MootPoot> you charge up your  ups and then unplug it
[22:47:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > MootPoot | and all of the stuff comes from africa and SE asia anyway right? | That is one of the issues yes. Several common locations don't have reliable (or any) power, so there's no ENF work possible.

[22:49:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah... if you live even slightly remote, getting a portable generator is pretty much a must. Ideally a proper backup generator in a transfer switch.
[22:49:49] <JesseDesu__> get a honda
[22:50:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For portable generators, there are kits for through-wall connections that allow you to set them up without create fume-inhalation risks.

[22:50:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because running extension cables through windows creates a point of intake for undesirable fumes.
[22:50:41] <JesseDesu__> isnt that called an extension cable
[22:50:49] <JesseDesu__> through your mail slot or something
[22:50:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu__: No, precisely not.
[22:51:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those are not sealed into your window or wall and so are dangerous.

[22:51:47] <MootPoot> I have a small 60w solar panel and a 204wh battery bank
[22:51:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> This allows you to put the generator a few meters away from the home, run the 30/50A power to the intake & do as you want inside.
[22:52:07] <MootPoot> enough to keep my m1 air and phone online forever
[22:52:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You'll most likely be running extension cables inside your home, but not opening up a door, mail slot or window means you're safer.
[22:52:29] <mixfix41> nice can you transmit the surplus to your energy company grid
[22:52:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mixfix41: Not without a particular setup.
[22:52:54] <mixfix41> better than battery though
[22:52:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And for that you'd be instead using a transfer switch because you don't want backfeeding to be a problem.

[23:11:45] <mixfix41> oh it was a video now i remmeber some cs teacher
[23:12:32] <MootPoot> emmeka: what do you even do with 40 acres
[23:12:42] <MootPoot> farming or horses, sure but
[23:12:47] <MootPoot>  for a normie?
[23:13:06] <MootPoot> that just sounds like a lot of work for a nice view when you can just watch your neighbours 200 acres
[23:13:48] <mixfix41> you cant do a milk business either cause pastuerizing is for corporations
[23:13:50] <mixfix41> i think
[23:14:08] <MootPoot> lets pasturize some companies
[23:14:10] <MootPoot> white people only
[23:14:21] <MootPoot> cute white milk maids
[23:14:23] <MootPoot> covered in milk
[23:15:41] <mixfix41> pouring milk on someone is a warning

[23:50:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> mixfix41: C is honsetly pretty low on the employment frequency.
[23:50:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Java, C#, C++, Python & JS tend to be the most common these days (varying by location).
[23:50:52] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I realised I suck at programming

[23:51:17] <MootPoot> its such a different skillset - doing leetcode vs actually producing applications
[23:55:32] <klaxa> writing code: easy
[23:55:37] <klaxa> writing good code: hard
[23:55:39] <klaxa> woah
[23:55:40] <klaxa> crazy
[23:55:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Depends on the good code too.
[23:55:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "
[23:56:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Enterprise (TM) Java is not good code.
[23:56:10] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: is that like knowing a real fancy perl one liner, and then trying to write an engine management system in perl?
[23:56:12] <MootPoot> doing leetcode has just reminded me how much I suck
[23:56:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But one can write perfectly good software with Java.
[23:56:17] <klaxa> but it's expensive code
[23:56:46] <klaxa> enterprise is just a buzzword for: the software is more expensive than the hardware it runs on
[23:56:57] <ButterNoodle> *license
[23:56:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I wouldn't write one in Perl personally. It does weird things & has some annoying idiosyncracies.
[23:57:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also the way it does subroutines annoys me.
[23:57:54] <klaxa> also always remember: copying code from stackoverflow: $0/year; knowing which code to copy from stackoverflow: $100k/year
[23:58:09] <ButterNoodle> idk anything but perl and php.. and I've forgotten most of that
[23:58:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> klaxa: You say that but I'm pretty sure some crypto & NFT scams have done exactly that and worked out not too bad.
[23:58:28] <mixfix41> theres a philosphy at ibm is if you solve a bug problem even its not your code you get credit for it
[23:58:44] <klaxa> pretty sure they copy off discord and telegram chats and not stackoverflow
[23:58:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Rather, not too bad for the creators, very much bad for those who fell for the scams
[23:59:08] <klaxa> and all the ones still falling for them
[23:59:38] <klaxa> but i do have to say, i started cryptomining on my server back in 2018 and i recently bought some ram and ssd for my laptop with some of that

[23:59:45] <mixfix41> also if you create a open source project and are maintainer you cant refuse a fix its kinda out there for the community which more pros than cons ie reiserfs
