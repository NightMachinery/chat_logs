[03:06:31] <Joanna> You would still need to know where gold is stored though
[03:06:57] <Matt|home> The depository is a secure facility. Between its fenced perimeter and granite lined concrete structure lie rings of razor wire and minefields.
[03:06:57] <Matt|home> yep
[03:07:00] <Matt|home> they literally mined it
[03:09:10] <elkclone> Bearing in mind that gold only has value because we think it does. We could just spend the weekend stealing Doge coin and place gold like function parameters onto Doge coin.

[03:10:26] <Matt|home> well, to be fair gold is inherintly valuable based on it's rarity and the fact that it has practical applications outside of jewelery
[03:10:41] <Matt|home> there's not that much of it on earth
[03:11:48] <elkclone> there is no gold.

[16:47:20] <Hylden> So, does PGP have the capacity to encrypt a file with my private key that no-one else but me can decrypt it? I'm a confused newbie
[16:50:09] <Apachez> they would use your public key
[16:50:17] <Apachez> then you use your private key to decrypt it
[16:50:22] <Apachez> magic of asymmetric encryption
[16:50:28] <Apachez> you have two keys which is a keypair
[16:50:30] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@106.203.195.217)
[16:50:32] <Apachez> key A and key B
[16:50:59] <Apachez> key A is called private key (since noone other than yourself should have this) and key B is public since this is the one you share with others
[16:51:01] <Hylden> I don't want anyone to be able to decrypt it but me
[16:51:14] <Apachez> so if you encrypt using key A (private) then only key B (public) can decrypt it
[16:51:18] <Apachez> and it swings the other way too
[16:51:31] <Apachez> stuff encrypted with key B (public) can only be decrypted using key A (private)
[16:51:59] <Apachez> the above is also used to sign things
[16:52:40] <Apachez> do a sha256 of a file/text and encrypt that sha256 using key A (private), then only those with your key B (public) can decrypt the hash and by that verify that the hash is accurate for a given file
[16:53:05] <Apachez> so in your case, create a keypair where you share the public part (key B) to foreigners
[16:53:14] *** Joins: aman (~aman@user/aman)
[16:53:17] <Hylden> Bah, I'll just use --symmetric
[16:53:25] <Apachez> they then use your key B (public) and encrypt the file... you with access to key A (private) is the only one who can decrypt the file
[16:53:49] <Apachez> good thing with symmetric: faster and more resilent against quantum bruteforce
[16:53:58] <Apachez> bad thing with symmetric: both parties knows the key
[16:54:45] <Apachez> many vpn solutions combines this... create a session based symmetric key to actually encrypt/Decrypt the packets (like one key per direction) and then exchange it using diffie hellman and verify the other party using asymmetric methods
