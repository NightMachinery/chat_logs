[00:39:00] <Nanobot> Someday, before I die, I hope to learn how to eat reheated lasagna without burning my mouth. I mean, I know *how* to, but it seems I don't know how to.
[00:39:00] <Bco1981> heated food is hot
[00:39:00] <Nanobot> Day 1: lasagna. Day 2: Mouth ceiling pillow.
[00:39:00] <Bco1981> let it cool off
[00:39:00] <Nanobot> Reheated lasagna has two states: Mouth-burning, and ice.
[00:39:01] <Nanobot> I haven't figured out how to nail the sweet spot.
[00:39:01] <Bco1981> i usually slice my lasagna up in bite sizes to let it cool off faster

[09:43:12] <amigojapan> Speculation
[09:43:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: right now in these organisations life must struggle for survival, but that is perhaps due to blockages of the flows of life that have developed due to certain paralogisms that affix this will into limited organisations

[09:46:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: as such, all life in our milieu has the same frenzied need to survive at any cost, or failing this, to attempt to unblock the flows of life

[09:48:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: at a certain point of desperation its unclear what we might be capable of
[09:49:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we must kill other organisms to survive
[09:49:23] <DunceCotus> that's what living is right now (due to blockages)
[09:49:52] <DunceCotus> even if those organisms are as basic as single cells, killing seems necessary for survival

[15:29:48] <amigojapan> iPhooey: do they ask you for your social security number for sending money abroad?

[17:13:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I know, but it is too much like the biblical one to take it seriously
[17:13:07] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its kind of like Earth is on an infinite plane, but there are finite bubbles
[17:13:18] <DunceCotus> the bubbles each have their own celestial sphere
[17:13:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this may work into a toroidal topology of cosmology
[17:14:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: your theory requires a whole bunch of things to be conspiracies. The globe earth one does not
[17:14:33] <DunceCotus> there are real conspiracies though
[17:15:22] <amigojapan> Yes but these are unlikely to be conspiracies in the eyes of most(as of now)
[17:16:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: when you think about it, people rely heavily on the word of big agencies such as NASA to 'prove' to them the heliocentric model
[17:16:43] <DunceCotus> we as ordinary people cannot fly up in rockets and actually see the shape or extent of Earth
[17:16:52] <DunceCotus> nor even if outer space is a real thing
[17:17:07] <DunceCotus> we have to rely on the word of a select few governmental/corporate agencies
[17:17:19] <DunceCotus> who are not working for the people btw, they're working for capital
[17:17:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the globe theory works well enough to predict time and weather and even eclipses. Why would we need a theory that does not even promise to predict things better in a testable way?
[17:17:58] <Bco1981> just try working with radio signals/line of sight stuff... you'd be surprise how short a distance you can actually messure the curveture of the earth.
[17:18:29] <DunceCotus> there may be a curvature to the Earth but that may not imply its a globe
[17:18:43] <DunceCotus> instead its more of a hump
[17:18:43] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I don't think DunceCotus is even open to listen to things like this
[17:19:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you can have an erroneous model predict many things accurately
[17:19:24] <DunceCotus> but that doesn't stop it from being ultimately erroneous, or having limitations in scope
[17:19:26] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that would depend on the amount of curvature
[17:19:58] <DunceCotus> there has been experiments done which seem to imply there's less of a curvature than mainstream science says
[17:20:28] <DunceCotus> or that objects can be seen when in the math the mainstream science relies upon would say we shouldn't be able to see them from that distance etc.
[17:20:57] <DunceCotus> like it should be obscured by the curve
[17:20:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: your theory is basically unfalsifiable
[17:21:05] <DunceCotus> my theory is very falsifiable
[17:21:11] <DunceCotus> it just takes resources
[17:21:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we need to move in a straight line
[17:21:31] <DunceCotus> that's it
[17:21:42] <DunceCotus> just move straight forward, any direction
[17:21:55] <DunceCotus> if my theory is correct we should pass through our bubble at some point

[17:22:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the bubbles may also be connected through underground cave systems

[17:24:56] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so perhaps the aliens use underground trenches or caves or even undersea trenches, to move between the bubbles (or did for a time)

[17:27:06] <DunceCotus> there's several layers or strata to the dome (or 'cell wall')
[17:27:15] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you say rich people want to keep the system going so we will never have the resources to go in a straight line
[17:27:30] <DunceCotus> one layer for the sun, one for the moon, one for the stars, one for the planets etc.
[17:27:37] <DunceCotus> then perhaps a solid icy layer
[17:28:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: another issue is how do we know we're going in a straight line..
[17:29:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but yes that is a problem in my theory's falsifiability, however its not insurmountable. I think its more just a matter of nobody's tried yet
[17:29:33] <DunceCotus> not even rich people, cause 1. they believe in heliocentrism or 2. they don't believe in heliocentrism but its more profitable for them to act like they believe in it
[17:29:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I guess you don't trust compasses
[17:30:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: consider the drifting of the magnetic poles
[17:30:15] <Cryowolf> huh?
[17:30:23] <DunceCotus> that seems fishy to me
[17:30:36] <Cryowolf> not so fishy...continental plates shift
[17:30:44] <Cryowolf> that makes it move
[17:31:01] <DunceCotus> magnet poles should be unaffected by continental plate drift
[17:31:18] <DunceCotus> cause the poles are generated by the total magnetic field of the planet

[17:31:38] <Cryowolf> yes but what do you think happens when something drifts over a static location and moves place?
[17:31:52] <Cryowolf> the static location has a "new location"
[17:31:59] <Cryowolf> but Im sure its more complicated than that
[17:32:05] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: nothing that dramatic should happen to the magnetic field
[17:32:09] <Cryowolf> something about the core spinning
[17:32:21] <Cryowolf> and its a slow shift
[17:32:34] <Cryowolf> but every now and then the magnetic fields flip

[17:41:06] <Cryowolf> if an investigatory body is formed, anyone who wasn't around forming it and is a conspiracy theorist will distrust it and your agency becomes their enemy
[17:41:18] <Cryowolf> then no matter how much you tell them the truth, it's not true
[17:41:24] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: should I believe it?
[17:42:00] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: we must distinguish between conspiracy theories and investigatory theoreticians
[17:42:09] <DunceCotus> conspiracy theory does not interest me
[17:42:15] <DunceCotus> that is where paranoia comes in
[17:42:27] <Cryowolf> and this continues on and on and on and it never stops. But sometimes, there's a sane person in the asylum that gathers actual irrefutable evidence
[17:42:30] <Cryowolf> and leaks it
[17:43:27] <DunceCotus> I suppose the question is why nobody has leaked the truth about the shape and extent of our world
[17:43:39] <DunceCotus> I think its because of how compartmentalised such knowledge is
[17:43:47] <DunceCotus> even the richest people don't have that intel
[17:44:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you said the flat earth society is not trust worthy
[17:44:21] <Cryowolf> one thing that's not a conspiracy of any sort is that the most powerful people in the world meet, as do the most influential and rich. That they exchange favors, money and information. This is an obvious fact and has been going on forever. It usedto be more local 2000 years ago, but it was happening then too
[17:44:25] <DunceCotus> I don't even think this is a deliberate, conscious conspiracy by a nefarious party (or elite), its much more unconscious than that
[17:44:32] <Cryowolf> so that's just the way things work
[17:45:02] <Cryowolf> and I dunno what you think the world is because tl;dr scrolling
[17:45:07] <Cryowolf> but if yhou can make it succinct
[17:45:14] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: bubblebath universe
[17:45:25] <Cryowolf> less succinct
[17:45:37] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: ground is an infinite plane, Earth is merely one bubble on it
[17:45:45] <DunceCotus> celestial objects are local to each bubble
[17:46:02] <DunceCotus> there is a multitude of bubbles
[17:46:55] <DunceCotus> and likely above the bubbles is some kind of medium, possibly plasmic or void, i'm not sure
[17:47:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if earth is an intimate plage it would have to be perfectly flare, is not it would become a sphere
[17:47:08] <DunceCotus> I do not think our sun is a nuclear reactor tho
[17:47:26] <Cryowolf> the earth became a sphere thanks to gravity though
[17:47:31] <HeTo> what about the celestial objects people have put in an orbit around the Earth?
[17:47:31] <Cryowolf> but its not a perfect sphere
[17:47:36] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: there's no gravity in this model
[17:47:49] <HeTo> in many inclinations from polar to equatorial
[17:48:03] <HeTo> also, is this bubble spinning?
[17:48:03] <DunceCotus> HeTo: those are trapped in a fluidic layer within the 'cell wall'
[17:48:09] <amigojapan> HeTo: he thinks they just sent them up to the dome

[17:49:16] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: the 'galaxies' are likely dust trapped in a fluidic layer of the cell wall
[17:49:18] <Cryowolf> so it's all an illusion then? But if you can't even make it a hypothesis, then this goes nowhere
[17:49:30] <Cryowolf> for something to be a hypothesis it can't have more than one assumption
[17:49:58] <DunceCotus> its not an illusion
[17:50:07] <DunceCotus> its just we've been interpreting data incorrectly
[17:50:23] <ButterNoodle> smaller masses exert weaker forces
[17:50:30] <Cryowolf> where's your evidence DunceCotus?
[17:50:31] <HeTo> DunceCotus: well, it's possible for a satellite to go in a straight line from the south pole to the north pole, not turn and just continue in that same straight line back to the south pole. it's also possible to do the same on the equator, in the end passing the same location as many times as you want. what's the shape that would make this possible?
[17:50:36] <ButterNoodle> chippai = lighter tugs on my pp
[17:51:03] <HeTo> also, I was asking about the surface in particular rotating
[17:51:06] <DunceCotus> HeTo: curved motion
[17:51:24] <DunceCotus> HeTo: the ground does not move
[17:51:33] <DunceCotus> the ground is grounded
[17:51:45] <DunceCotus> plates may move about but that's another story
[17:51:53] <Bco1981> lol
[17:51:56] <DunceCotus> (and probably not due to magma)
[17:52:26] <Cryowolf> Plates move due to pressure, gravity, magnetism etc
[17:52:43] <DunceCotus> they move due to plasmic discharges perhaps
[17:52:54] <Cryowolf> they move rather slowly though with the occasional big shift after an earthquake
[17:53:04] <HeTo> DunceCotus: well... we can measure the rotation of the Earth using laser gyros sitting on the surface
[17:53:18] <DunceCotus> HeTo: oh?
[17:53:38] <Cryowolf> no they build up tension because one rolls under the other but not all of it melts down to magma, eventually the pressure is so great that the plate rolling under the other snaps back up
[17:53:46] <Cryowolf> creating a massive force
[17:54:04] <Cryowolf> that's one way massive earth quakes are generated
[17:54:09] <DunceCotus> HeTo: keep in mind that is interpretation of data
[17:54:22] <Cryowolf> and why Japan is hit with so many, being smack in the middle of tons of tectonic plates
[17:54:23] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: I see
[17:54:42] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: this all could happen on a non-globe Earth I suspect
[17:55:36] <Cryowolf> like I said, if you want to take this to the level of a hypothesis you must have solid imperical evidence on everything except ONE assumption that you're trying to prove to be plausible
[17:55:50] <Cryowolf> if you introduce a second assumption, it's no longer a hypothesis, it's speculation
[17:56:08] <HeTo> DunceCotus: yeah, the IRU on any airliner from the past 40 years (any of the several) has laser gyros sensitive enough to measure that. and the reference unit will know the latitude and true (not magnetic) heading of the plane after a few minutes of alignment after they've been started up, with the plane sitting still
[17:57:18] <ButterNoodle> the earth is not round
[17:57:44] <Cryowolf> mostly is but the moon stretches it a bit
[17:57:54] <ButterNoodle> its not even an oblique spheroid
[17:57:55] <Cryowolf> and it's not a perfect sphere due to mountains and such
[17:58:20] <Cryowolf> it's somewhat elongated by the moons gravitational force, hence tides

[17:59:42] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: its a bit rich to go on about evidence when of course I don't have the resources to gather evidence
[17:59:53] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, well yes that's what earth looks like but now look into how the moon makes our planet stretch
[17:59:54] <ButterNoodle> if someones boobies were shaped like that.. you'd get them fixed
[18:00:13] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf: I think the sun has more effect than the moon..
[18:00:14] <DunceCotus> it may all be speculation but it rings truer than the heliocentric model of a universe of mostly empty space, 'dark matter', gravity which can't be unified with other fundamental forces etc
[18:00:40] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, the moon stretches the planet and causes the oceans to shift, creating tides
[18:00:46] <ButterNoodle> ik we think about tidal forces caused by the moon and all. but its relatively a small amount of force compared to sol
[18:00:46] <DunceCotus> "space-time"
[18:01:14] <Cryowolf> the sun isn't close enough to have such a strong immediate and localized effect
[18:01:21] <ButterNoodle> tell the moon to catch me out back when it has enough mass to influence time
[18:01:21] <Cryowolf> it's too big and too far away
[18:01:33] <Cryowolf> but if it wasnt for the sun, the earth wouldnt stretch
[18:01:35] <ButterNoodle> thats untrue
[18:01:37] <Cryowolf> cause it wouldnt be held back
[18:02:14] <Cryowolf> of course it is, the sun can't have a localized effect when it has an effect on the entire planet
[18:02:28] <Cryowolf> between the moon and the sun, the planet becomes slightly stretched

[18:05:21] <ButterNoodle> who needs a yard stick?
[18:05:27] <Cryowolf> depends on the country
[18:05:35] <Cryowolf> you're assuming the whole world carres about nasa
[18:05:46] <Cryowolf> why would Russia or China care about nasa?
[18:05:52] <DunceCotus> well other countries have their own space agencies that act in a similar yard stick capacity to NASA
[18:06:00] <ButterNoodle> no normal man needs a ruler longer than 8"
[18:06:08] <DunceCotus> but all those agencies are running on the same heliocentric dogma
[18:06:38] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, but what you're saying ultimately boils down to "if you have more power than me, you're in on i t"
[18:07:07] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: no. Because NASA and other space agencies have a lot more power than me, you, rich guy 1, etc.
[18:07:22] <DunceCotus> they are of a completely different order of magnitude of power
[18:07:30] <Cryowolf> NASA barely had any funding for over a decade
[18:07:47] <Cryowolf> SpaceX has more funding right now
[18:08:11] <ButterNoodle> moth balled shuttles
[18:08:15] <DunceCotus> funding or not they still act as yardstick in astronomy
[18:08:28] <ButterNoodle> maybe in research
[18:08:30] <DunceCotus> SpaceX draws from the space agencies too
[18:08:37] <DunceCotus> and is likely 'in on it'
[18:08:54] <ButterNoodle> the actual work being done is going to be 100% private in the next decade
[18:09:02] <Cryowolf> nasa has gathered research or done it themselves, collected meta studies and are using them as models
[18:09:05] <ButterNoodle> with agencies providing management
[18:09:07] <DunceCotus> esp. given Elon Musks promises of putting people on Mars
[18:09:27] <DunceCotus> (Mars is drifting detritus in our Earth's cell wall)
[18:09:34] <ButterNoodle> I want to be the first human to nutt on mars
[18:09:37] <Cryowolf> then other researchers look at the data NASA has gathered and either expand on it or challenge it
[18:10:05] <Cryowolf> astrophysicists love to test their theories or hypothesis to make it into a theory and learn something new
[18:10:37] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: they can test and challenge all they want, so long as they keep within the bounds of heliocentrism
[18:10:49] <DunceCotus> any experimentation outside of that and they lose funding
[18:11:02] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, I imagine if you nut on mars it would fly a lot longer with stronger viscosity
[18:11:17] <DunceCotus> same goes with politics.. stick to markets, capital, productivity, anything outside of that and you lose funding

[18:58:38] <darkwitch> ok, I don't know nathan's hotdogs
[18:59:31] <amigojapan> darkwitch: famous American hotdogs
[19:00:11] <darkwitch> they were not famous enough to get my attention
[19:00:47] <Cryowolf> Im thinking of colaborating with an artist I know to make a lightnovel, he'll be illustrator and I'll be author. We'll release it as a web novel at first and see if it works out into something in which case Im trying to figure out how much of % he should get
[19:01:25] <Cryowolf> considering I will be spending my time not only writing but also planning, managing etc and his only job is to draw. Which is not to say it doesn't take talent nor is easy
[19:01:35] <Cryowolf> but 50% sounds too much to give  
[19:01:53] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: it is likely people won't read it if you charge money
[19:01:59] <Cryowolf> we won't
[19:02:05] <Cryowolf> the plan is to get people interested
[19:02:15] <Cryowolf> and then find a publisher
[19:02:18] <amigojapan> Ok
[19:02:28] <Cryowolf> if it works out
[19:02:45] <amigojapan> I see
[19:02:59] <Cryowolf> I have an acquaintance whose drawing style resembles Berserk
[19:03:03] <Cryowolf> with a bit of Claymore to it
[19:03:30] <Cryowolf> and he can draw dark stuff and since Im making a dark fantasy thats perfect
[19:04:43] <darkwitch> will there be a dark witch in it?
[19:04:55] <MootPoot> cock
[19:04:59] <Cryowolf> if we get a publisher though, I guess it depends how much we're colaborating on it all. If I'm basically comissioning it or if we're working together. If we're working together 100% then I think he does deserve half. Or should I say, the company gets some, then we get some
[19:06:08] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it seems we don't use the intestin anymore to care for dogs
[19:06:18] <Cryowolf> darkwitch, probably. Witches are in this lore not so much just a practicioner of magic but rather cursed humans, who've gained the ability to use magic as a result of the curse. But the curse also causes disfigurement and such
[19:06:51] <Cryowolf> and it only gives access to magic related to the curse
[19:07:07] <darkwitch> witches lose again
[19:07:13] <Cryowolf> which is why 99% of all witches use dark magic
[19:07:19] <Cryowolf> cause curses are dark

[19:10:13] <Cryowolf> the stronger ones would be "primals". People born with an innate connection to an element that they can command. Basically sorcerer/sorcereress, except they have a secret about them. Why they can use such primal forces so easily
[19:10:22] <darkwitch> lol, ok :)
[19:10:43] <Cryowolf> I'm trying to find a software that I can use to create an easy wiki
[19:10:47] <Cryowolf> for my lore
[19:10:59] <Cryowolf> to use myself so I don't forget every detail
[19:11:04] <amigojapan> darkwitch: my misspellings are worse than single letter typoes
[19:11:29] <darkwitch> intestines are definitely still used. however, not for every type of sausage
[19:12:18] * MootPoot does jumping jacks with his intestine
[19:12:30] <amigojapan> Ah ok darkwitch , they said getting intestines clean is hard
[19:12:50] <Cryowolf> darkwitch, but did you know if a witch kills the person that put a curse on them and eat their heart, they become free of the curse, die and  resurrect as a demon?
[19:13:19] <Cryowolf> or well they need to take the heart out while the person is alive
[19:13:27] <Cryowolf> and using magic to keep him alive as they eat it
[19:13:37] <Cryowolf> but then they obbiously die
[19:13:51] <Cryowolf> so dont worry, witches aren't 100% screwed
[19:14:20] <darkwitch> that sounds needlessly complicated Cryowolf, but it is your story, so you get to decide
[19:16:20] *** Quits: Arcorann (~A@user/arcorann) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[19:16:35] <Cryowolf> why needlessly complicated? They eat the heart of the person that cursed them and break free of the curse. At that point they will die, but die free of the curse. Then they since theyve been using dark magic and tainted their soul with the curse + the magic, they
[19:16:38] <Cryowolf> become a demon
[19:17:15] <Cryowolf> not that complicated
[19:17:22] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it seems there are also "skinless hot dogs
[19:17:52] <Cryowolf> but witches who want to be free of it all, return to the light and have a normal life and death? nah
[19:18:04] <darkwitch> yeah, too many weird steps for me
[19:18:13] <Cryowolf> there's one step
[19:18:23] <Cryowolf> eat the heart of the person who cursed you
[19:18:47] <darkwitch> I'm not even sure why that would do anything
[19:18:54] <darkwitch> if you say so, ok
[19:19:10] <Cryowolf> because the heart is the anchor to the soul
[19:19:49] <Cryowolf> so theyre basically eating their soul
[19:20:22] <Cryowolf> but that only works cause the curse binds them to it, otherwise it's just a deviant thing
[19:20:25] <Cryowolf> eating hearts
[19:20:46] <darkwitch> I tested some new samples today, the weirdest one being Flora√Øku's One Umbrella for Two
[19:20:55] <Cryowolf> how else would they break free of a curse you think?
[19:21:18] <Cryowolf> keep in mind it's dark fantasy
[19:21:19] <Jigsy> Using Curse-Be-Gone!
[19:21:22] <darkwitch> it's like black currant that tries to be blueberry, mixed with genmaicha tea
[19:22:00] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I like genmaicha
[19:22:02] <darkwitch> there is also some weird bitter notes of cedar wood
[19:22:05] <Cryowolf> I value feedback and why you dont think it makes sense or what you see a curuse to be
[19:22:41] <darkwitch> it ends up smelling like a bitter blueberry muffin that someone forgot to take out of the oven
[19:25:45] <darkwitch> I think world building is a really difficult exercise
[19:27:23] <darkwitch> that is perhaps why so many writers skip it, use a ready made setting and just add their own characters
[19:27:25] <Cryowolf> darkwitch, When in this world the  heart is the anchor of the soul to a body (or vessel, if you make something artificial and imbue it with someones or a soul.) And magic (even curses) come from the realm the soul otherwise inhabits (where the anchor leads), to eat the heart is to eat the soul and sever the curse.  Of course the curse breaking kills them, cause the human body cant withstand consuming anothers soul
[19:27:57] <Cryowolf> at least noto a regular human body
[19:28:25] <Cryowolf> this obviously is lore that will slowly be revealed
[19:28:40] <darkwitch> all right Cryowolf
[19:28:40] <Cryowolf> not like everything will be thrown in someones face with monologue exposition
[19:29:38] <amigojapan> darkwitch: do you know a Japanese guy became a champion of hit dogs eating contest five years in a row?
[19:30:28] * darkwitch did not know this very important fact
[19:30:57] <Cryowolf> the way magic works and where it comes from. How some people have more powerful connections to their vessels (giving them more "mana".) How if you die as a human and your soul is strong enouogh but also tainted, you might be offered a pact by a demon to bring you back. It's strong enough cause you just ate another persons soul and took it over :P
[19:31:39] <Cryowolf> I like making things connect in a natural way that makes more sense when its not all thrown at you at once

[19:33:03] <darkwitch> it can not be good for his body
[19:33:14] <amigojapan> True
[19:33:20] <Cryowolf> darkwitch, what do you think of the idea of the heart being what anchors a body to a soul (or spirit or astralis, whatever you want to call it)? This isn't true just for magic users, even regular people. It's what makes a person, a person, pretty much
[19:33:26] <darkwitch> eating 50 hot dogs in 12 minutes
[19:33:57] <Cryowolf> and when you grow old and die and your heart stops, your soul loses its anchor and returns fully to the other plane
[19:34:06] <Cryowolf> or if you get stabbed and die
[19:34:21] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I am full with 2 hot dogs
[19:34:22] <darkwitch> Cryowolf, I can not really relate to that. my world view is rather different. if it works for your story, then that's fine.
[19:34:36] <Cryowolf> darkwitch, can you explain?
[19:34:52] <darkwitch> not now, I must eat hotdogs
[19:34:58] <Cryowolf> it would help me a lot if I understood others perspectives
[19:36:11] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I think darkwitch wants to be a witch like in flying witch. Not something so dramatic as your idea
[19:36:30] <Cryowolf> well I didnt ask about the witch thing, I asked about the soul thing
[19:37:10] <amigojapan> Ok Cryowolf but eating sometimes heart is pretty dramatic
[19:37:55] <Cryowolf> to me the idea is based in logic and then of course expanded into fiction. That if your heart stops working, you die. Meaning that the way a persons soul is attached to a body is by anchoring to the heart. The very life force of a person
[19:38:06] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, it 's dark fantasy. Of course it's gonna be dark

[21:38:07] <MootPoot> I've found the best way to shave is to shave twice
[21:38:12] <darkwitch> laser works too, but it's very expensive
[21:38:21] <MootPoot> to get that baby ass face but without razor burn
[21:38:28] <MootPoot> 2 passes on day 1, then 2 passes on day 2
[21:38:40] <darkwitch> it may not be recommended for beards, but I have heard about guys doing it
[21:39:42] <MootPoot> idk why, or maybe other people are the same
[21:39:52] <MootPoot> any more then 2 passes from a razor = instant razor burn
[21:40:13] <ButterNoodle> depends on the blade
[21:40:39] <ButterNoodle> when I shaved.. I shaved against the grain with a 4 blade razor

[22:46:50] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  you do because its not 1 person counting your vote
[22:46:55] <emmeka> insofar as you trust parties to be self-interested.
[22:46:55] <theholyduck> its done on paper in public
[22:47:06] <theholyduck> infront of every party with an intrest in the election
[22:47:09] <MootPoot> or if the pen they give me is not like some kind of ink that goes transparent in a hour after you write it
[22:47:18] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  have more then 1 machine?
[22:47:29] <emmeka> MootPoot all parties send reps to watch the ballot counts, if any vote counted incorrectly they will object.
[22:47:32] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  what does that change?
[22:47:53] <MootPoot> your issue was that only 1 entity was validating the vote right
[22:48:04] <theholyduck> not rreally 
[22:48:08] <theholyduck> its that a digital thing is validating the vote
[22:48:15] <theholyduck> which means somebody in china
[22:48:20] <theholyduck> can be trying to hack the election
[22:48:26] <theholyduck> and only needs to hack 1 or 2 machines
[22:48:37] <theholyduck> attacks on digital voting scales easily
[22:48:49] <theholyduck> attacks on physical paper ballots scale increadibly porely
[22:49:03] <theholyduck> you CAN attack physical paper balloting but the ods of you changing enough of them to matter without getting caught
[22:49:05] <theholyduck> is essentially 0
[22:49:06] <emmeka> attacks on physical paper ballots are impossible in our system
[22:49:34] *** Quits: ninjabuffet (~ninjabuff@user/ninjabuffet) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:49:57] <theholyduck> yeah i have no idea why us states use voting machines or use counting machines or anything like that
[22:50:03] <theholyduck> just put more people into the process 
[22:50:06] <theholyduck> if you want  a faster count
[22:50:22] <theholyduck> norwegian elections are usually counted completely in like 3 hours or so
[22:50:51] <MootPoot> idk, tbh to me it sounds like any issue you have with elections could be brought up against banks
[22:50:55] <MootPoot> online banking
[22:51:00] <MootPoot> but that also works just fine
[22:51:02] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  yes and no
[22:51:14] <emmeka> MootPoot no, because in the case of banks, the bank has every interest in securing itself.
[22:51:16] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  the difference is. its not dangerous to be able to check bank records
[22:51:20] <theholyduck> later
[22:51:29] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  like the whole point of an election is that you CANT check records
[22:51:38] <theholyduck> in banking theres EXTENSIVE records to check
[22:51:44] <theholyduck> because anonymity isnt a goal
[22:51:46] <emmeka> MootPoot an election is a process that basically everyone involved in stands to benefit from if it is comprimised in their favour.
[22:52:15] <MootPoot> That sounds exactly like a bank transaction emmeka 
[22:52:20] <emmeka> no?
[22:52:36] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  again though. even if you were right that its like a bank transaction. the bank actually keeps complete transaction logs
[22:52:40] <theholyduck> of who sent in and out what and where
[22:52:42] <MootPoot> if its comprimised in the banks favor, they get to keep more, if in the senders or recievers, they get to keep more
[22:52:51] <theholyduck> MootPoot: which means you can infact audit the results
[22:52:52] <theholyduck> for errors
[22:53:06] <emmeka> your bank runs your online banking system. it has every motivation to ensure transactions are genuine and not fraudulent, as it is on the hook.
[22:53:08] <MootPoot> theholyduck:  why is having no voting records a good thing
[22:53:09] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  like banks do occationally make errors on transaction. 
[22:53:17] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  ok. hypothethical 
[22:53:23] <MootPoot> they make us sign up for voting here
[22:53:25] <MootPoot> with ID and stuff
[22:53:30] <theholyduck> im the "i hate poots" party
[22:53:34] <MootPoot> what
[22:53:39] * MootPoot grumbles
[22:53:46] <theholyduck> and i say. i will give 30 bucks to everyone who votes for my party
[22:53:48] <emmeka> there are voting records but it's not the same as observing the validity of individual ballots
[22:53:51] <theholyduck> after election day
[22:54:00] <theholyduck> in current reality that doesnt matter
[22:54:05] <theholyduck> because nobody can definitly prove
[22:54:09] <theholyduck> they voted for i hate poots party
[22:54:12] <theholyduck> they could SAY they did
[22:54:16] <theholyduck> but they have no way to verify it
[22:54:18] <theholyduck> and i have no way to verify it
[22:54:52] <theholyduck> they went into a empty room. and voted exactly once. in a way that nobody can see what they voted for
[22:55:06] <theholyduck> not the husband of a battered wife 
[22:55:19] <theholyduck> not the radical teenager of a conservative family 
[22:55:39] <theholyduck> MootPoot: its critical for election integrity that nobody can ever prove who voted a certain way. 
[22:55:55] <theholyduck> MootPoot: infact if you mark your ballot in such a way that somebody could be identified
[22:55:58] <theholyduck> its imediatly an invalid balot
[22:56:18] <theholyduck> like if you sign your name to it. or draw a symbol or whatever
[22:56:28] <emmeka> it's also a major crime to take a picture of your ballot
[22:56:28] <MootPoot> why not just keep records for validation the next day, but then make it inaccessible for anybody outside of that after
[22:56:33] <emmeka> do that, you face jailtime.
[22:56:34] <MootPoot> emmeka: lol really
[22:56:39] <emmeka> yes.
[22:56:43] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  election security is important
[22:56:53] <theholyduck> MootPoot: because why keep records of who voted what at all
[22:57:00] <emmeka> this happens every election, usually people taking dumb selfies and just getting yelled at for it and then apologizing
[22:57:05] <theholyduck> all we care about is how many people voted for what
[22:57:06] <emmeka> anyway.
[22:57:28] <emmeka> MootPoot here's the problem: paper ballots are nearly impossible to comprimise at any sort of scale simply owing to the observation process of sealed votes. Any digital process is /entirely dependant/ on the security of the machine you are using, and there is no simple, smoking gun way to verify tampering. The most fundamental problem is that you have to trust whoever is making/running the machines 100%
[22:57:31] <emmeka> and this cannot be done.
[22:57:31] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  being able to tie it back to a specific person can have all sorts  of problem
[22:57:52] <theholyduck> emmeka:  the one way it COULD be done would involve it no longer being a secret election
[22:57:59] <theholyduck> being able to log in later and check what your vote got counted as
[22:58:05] <emmeka> everyone in an election stands to benefit from it being comprimised in their favour, therefore you can trust nobody to run it, the only safe process is one where all forces involved can see the entire process together.
[22:58:21] <emmeka> theholyduck well yeah, but that's not how we do elections and is extremely dangerous.
[22:58:25] <theholyduck> exactly
[22:58:28] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[22:58:32] <theholyduck> which is what ive been trying to explain to MootPoot :P
[22:58:32] <emmeka> a secret ballot is basically fundamental to democracy
[22:58:48] <theholyduck> that nobody can know what you voted for is like the nr1 tenat of a free and fair election
[22:59:10] <theholyduck> its how you stop vote buying. or voter intimidation. or whatever
[22:59:25] <theholyduck>  or the goverment looking at the records and giving everyone who voted for them a 100 buck tax break
[22:59:27] <theholyduck> or whatever
[22:59:58] <emmeka> or just 20 years down the road some government deciding everyone who ever voted for a communist needs to go to a prison camp, or whatever
[23:00:46] <emmeka> the other problem is that for a public ballot to be actually useable, ANYONE needs to be able to look at it and verify it
[23:00:55] <emmeka> this means your employers could check who you voted for
[23:01:22] <emmeka> or your dad, or whatever
[23:01:35] <theholyduck> MootPoot: do you feel convinced yet?
[23:02:11] <theholyduck> anyways. i voted in a paper ballot going into a tamper sealed urn and its going to be counted by hand under the watchful eye of every party with a stake in the election
[23:02:20] <theholyduck> and thats why i trust my vote got counted
[23:02:22] <MootPoot> urn
[23:02:32] <MootPoot> sounds like a pita tbh
[23:02:36] <MootPoot> but whatever
[23:02:45] <MootPoot> I'm getting paid for it
[23:02:48] <theholyduck> MootPoot: its how all elections in non banana republics are run
[23:02:55] * theholyduck looks at the united states
[23:02:59] <MootPoot> maybe this is why the student vote is is low
[23:03:07] <MootPoot> nobody wants to waste so much time
[23:03:07] <theholyduck> having to vote on paper?
[23:03:11] <emmeka> it's labour intensive but it lasts a few hours for 1 day every couple of years, and that's basically fine
[23:03:12] <theholyduck> waste what time?
[23:03:14] <mixfix41> inventors wear nice suits politicians dont make nothin

[23:03:32] <emmeka> MootPoot it's not more effort for a voter.
[23:03:43] <Llamamoe> Literally everything you ever said on social media, via text, in presence of google assistant, has had at the VERY least metadata recorded
[23:03:50] <MootPoot> elections canada afaik just cancelled their vote on campus program
[23:04:00] <emmeka> MootPoot yeah and that's bullshit tbh
[23:04:02] <Llamamoe> Any sufficiently resourceful party has a more full profile of you than you do 
[23:04:25] <theholyduck> Llamamoe: sure. and that doesnt really change that they still cant know who you voted for 100% :P
[23:04:42] <theholyduck> Llamamoe:  paper voting is still a fine concept. wearing a spy device at all times might not be one
[23:05:06] <theholyduck> Llamamoe:  your phone spying on you is not a great excuse to make voting less secure
[23:05:19] <emmeka> Llamamoe sure, they can sus out commie sympathizers or whatever with enough help from Zuck and Co. But there's sympathizers who shitpost on fb and then voters.
