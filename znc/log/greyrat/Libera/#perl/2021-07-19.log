[01:17:02] <awslabspl> excuse me for my stupid question; Im total beginer. What Perl is used for?
[01:17:22] <lopid> programming computers
[01:22:01] <awslabspl> lopid thats what I know. More specifically please
[01:22:48] <lopid> i don't know if the question can be any more vague
[01:23:26] <Yaakov> Perl is a general purpose programming language that is very flexible and is used in a lot of applications. It is a dynamic language that is compiled at runtime, so it is part compiled-part interpreter. It is particularly good at processing text, and so sees a lot of use in systems administration and other things that need that.
[01:24:24] <Yaakov> It also has the advantage of an amazing library of user contributed modules—CPAN—which means it is usually the case your problem has already been solved for you.
[01:24:39] <awslabspl> Yaakov many thanks :)  How frequent are new releases?
[01:24:58] <ehuelsmann[m]> awslabspl: I guess our question is: which particular information are you looking for. Are you looking for a specific application you'd like to use it for and now wondering if that's a good idea?
[01:25:24] <Yaakov> Perl is a language that is very easy to program in once you have some facility. I like to say, "C is a programming language, perl is a way of telling your computer what you want it to do".
[01:25:33] <choroba> A new version is released every year.
[01:25:42] <Yaakov> Releases of Perl 5 are pretty frequent. It is very actively maintained.
[01:27:07] <ehuelsmann[m]> awslabspl: check this table to see all the releases so far: https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhist#THE-RECORDS
[01:27:07] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ perlhist - the Perl history records - Perldoc Browser ]
[01:28:42] <Yaakov> Perl also has the advantage of the perl community, which has an outsized share of exceptionally capable programmers. Many perl users get involved in designing and extending the language and the language itself has a lot of sophisticated programming facilities for those who can take advantage of them.
[01:28:47] <awslabspl> ehuelsmann[m] will definitely have a look :)  where to learn Perl from?

[01:39:33] <nirnam> where can I get perl for lisp programmer guide?
[01:40:01] <ether> perl for lisp users? that would be a fun book to write
[01:40:21] <ether> there's a lot of expressiveness in perl that would feel quite natural to a lisp user, like nested greps and maps
[01:40:41] <nirnam> I meant that as a joke but now that I think about it
[01:40:48] <ether> I get very frustrated when I have to write go and something that would take a line or two of perl takes twenty in go
[01:41:39] <ether> having to be so verbose means that readability is impaired - a simple thing takes up so much space on the page (and in the brain) that you can't view the program from a 20 meter vantage, only 2 meter

[15:43:12] <bobsy> everything in the sub refers to an existing discord module as $self->discord
[15:43:58] <bobsy> do i need to reference hailo in a similar manner with something like has discord     => ( is => 'lazy', builder => sub {

[15:44:58] <Botje-> bobsy: if you install this 'hailo' thing as a class member then you can grab it via $self->hailo

[15:45:08] *** Joins: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org)
[15:45:12] <Altreus> if you're extending an existing bot then you should probably just copy the simplest command it already has and replace the content with something else
[15:45:22] <Altreus> bobsy: good idea :) there's a pastebin in the topic
[15:45:34] <Botje-> bobsy: but you should probably start with just creating a 'hailo' instance at the place you need it.
[15:45:46] <bobsy> Altreus: yeah thats what i did, but hailo doesn't reply ...

[15:48:33] <bobsy> oh yeah oops
[15:48:41] <Botje-> next, did you check whether $hailo->reply($msg) produces anything useful?
[15:48:42] <Altreus> I see that your indentation is all over the place
[15:49:10] <Altreus> perhaps this lines up in your editor actually

[15:49:38] <bobsy> Botje-: oh yeah!
[15:49:54] <Botje-> bobsy: so you should probably do Hailo->new({brain => $self->brain_file}) instead on line 77

[16:07:03] <curdlesnoot> well, surely that's the purpose of the reply() method. the idea was to print the content of $msg itself.
[16:07:35] <Altreus> yeah put $msg as well as $hailo->reply($msg) in the same line

[16:43:12] <Botje-> yes.
[16:43:26] <Altreus> I have specifically avoided this in raku API::Discord
[16:43:35] <Altreus> Is there a use case for the bot hearing about its own messages?
[16:43:51] <bobsy> i'd rather it only respond to it's $name

[16:51:47] <Altreus> you don't need lc because of i

[18:01:33] <curdlesnoot> there must be a method to get the currently effective id of the bot.
[18:01:39] <bobsy> oh right
[18:02:17] <rindolf> simcop2387: ah, i dont mind ppl eavesdropping; i do mind unreliability
[18:02:24] <bobsy> lol
[18:02:28] <bobsy> mentions username
[18:02:51] <Altreus> $hash->{id} would appear to be the bot
[18:02:58] <curdlesnoot> it's not, though.
[18:03:05] <Altreus> then what the heck is it
[18:03:12] <curdlesnoot> my guess is the id of the message sender.
[18:03:16] <curdlesnoot> which would make perfect sense.
[18:03:21] <Altreus> oh it's the message itself
[18:03:24] <Altreus> This is a message object
[18:03:35] <curdlesnoot> well, you could use the username. using the id would be better, though.

[18:03:53] <curdlesnoot> so, is it an object property?
[18:04:03] <Altreus> but there's no $self
[18:04:42] <curdlesnoot> I suspect it's $self->{id}.

[22:16:24] <LeoNerd> I want to send the bytes "\x00\xFF" to a serial port.   echo -ne "\x00\xFF" >/dev/ttyUSB0  works fine from bash, not from makefile. I presume because echo is shell builtin
[22:16:31] <LeoNerd> anyone any suggestions?

[22:16:50] <thrig> printf(1) ?
[22:16:52] <buZz> how about executing a #!/bin/bash .sh file from your makefile
[22:16:55] <simcop2387> t's not echo but the \x =
[22:17:15] <LeoNerd> Ut's the -e flag
[22:17:26] <simcop2387> oh -e too yea
[22:17:26] <LeoNerd> I tried printf. same trouble
[22:17:48] <simcop2387> i'd just use perl or bash directly
[22:18:02] <LeoNerd> mmm perl might do
[22:18:10] <alh> /usr/bin/echo ?
[22:18:11] <furrymcgee> whats make -n output?
[22:18:23] <LeoNerd> echo -n  suppresses the linefeed
