[00:26:01] <eyynet4> where did the free ocxygen come from to create the rust
[00:26:01] <GeDaMo> Presumably it was originally formed at the same time as the solar system
[00:26:04] <Inhahe>  maybe that part is known and explained elsewhere

[00:41:04] <user51> basically it's a combination of language being quite dense, concepts being talked about in obtuse manner, something like that
[00:41:19] <pyzozord> user51: oh I see
[00:42:01] <user51> take automata theory for example. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory#Formal_definition
[00:42:23] <user51> from an implementor's point of view, how much of that is useful?
[00:42:37] <pyzozord> yeah there is a certain breed of authors who I think believe aquiring knoweledge should be difficult since it was difficult for them. Or they don't really care about how they present it to less seasoned audience (like people who are not professors of cs in this specific field)
[00:44:57] <pyzozord> user51: yeah that definition goes over my head. As far as I can see it says "automaton is made out of five things: input things, output things, states, state transitions, state outputs. Each thing has a fancy greek letter"
[00:45:36] <pyzozord> "but the greek letter could have been replaced with emojis and nothing would change"

[07:39:06] *** Quits: leeper (leeper@gateway/vpn/nordvpn/leeper) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:39:46] <oldlaptop> Web servers are HTTP servers by definition. There exist specialized HTTP servers that aren't intended to serve web pages, but I would argue that even those are Web servers by definition as well.
[07:40:10] <vdamewood> It's kind of like the difference between a terminal server, and an ssh server.
[07:40:16] <Izem> ok I think I get it. it's only really related since you can use http to serve html files which browsers can render
[07:40:53] <vdamewood> 'terminal' (or web) describes why you're using the server, ssh (or http) describes the protocol you're using.
[07:41:39] <Izem> a terminal server could be telnet though, while web stuff is just http
[07:41:57] <vdamewood> Yep, or Microsoft's RDP for that matter.

[07:42:15] <oldlaptop> "Web server" and "HTTP server" are functionally synonymous.
[07:42:37] <vdamewood> but yeah, http is the only protocol used for the Web, so the venn diagram of web servers, and http servers is a circle.
[07:42:49] <Izem> ok cool
[07:43:47] <oldlaptop> Note in particular that even non-specialized Web servers that are intended to serve Web pages often are used to do things other than serve Web pages, such as implement wacked-out RPC mechanisms over HTTP.

[07:44:44] <vdamewood> And yes, someone could do that. XML was such an attempt.
[07:44:50] <oldlaptop> I would argue most "modern" Web pages are not hypertext documents, and are not written in HTML.
[07:44:51] <Izem> oh ok
[07:45:12] <vdamewood> But the XML was/is still served over HTTP.

[07:46:01] <oldlaptop> vdamewood: I wouldn't call XHTML "serving XML instead of HTML", it was an attempt (and basically an abject failure) to redefine HTML in terms of XML.
[07:46:27] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: HTML is the stub that's used to load the JavaScript that's a stub to load the WebASM.

[09:26:07] <Joanna> Did you see a protest in person?
[09:26:14] <Joanna> Is it near your home?
[09:26:25] <Arahael> I didn't go and see it, no.
[09:26:31] <Arahael> I stayed home like a sane person.

[11:20:38] <DrJaneyDoe> i dont get how the correlate the 'gas' with the actual amount of energy your compute takes

[11:21:57] <DrJaneyDoe> unless everyone gets same compute
[11:24:11] <W> it's not a correlation as such, just a heuristic
[11:24:17] <beaky> nice i like compute
[11:24:30] <beaky> my favorite proof tactic in coq
[11:24:36] <W> basically, every operation is allocated some cost, that may or may not be what it actually costs in a real CPU
[11:25:03] <W> and every contract is in this limited language that is guaranteed to terminate and execute the same way every time
[11:26:03] <W> (with no way to e.g. call the operating system to modify files or anything like that - basically the "running whatever" is restricted by the language not having features for "whatever")

[13:04:47] <smallville7123> how can i implement `pointer id` ?
[13:06:12] <Arahael> smallville7123: first, you must explain what you mean by that.
[13:06:50] <smallville7123> like, tracking current pointers as they are added and removed
[13:07:14] <Arahael> smallville7123: that will depend on the language.
[13:07:18] <smallville7123> for a multi-touch event callback system
[13:07:39] <Arahael> woah, so you mean *mouse* pointers?
[13:07:57] <smallville7123> yes, or *finger* pointers
[13:08:02] <Arahael> or at least, multi-touch pointers, yeah.
[13:08:07] <Arahael> context matters!
[13:08:08] <smallville7123> yup
[13:08:19] <smallville7123> ok :)
[13:08:48] <smallville7123> as my current implementation breaks for more than 1 pointer
[13:09:02] <smallville7123> eg if i have 2 pointers active, both their pointer id's are 1
[13:09:06] <Arahael> smallville7123: anyway, since you aren't talking about memory pointers, what you're asking is generally easy - but it depends on the framework you're using - which often does this for you.
[13:09:19] <smallville7123> even though the pointer count is 0
[13:09:22] <smallville7123> 2 *
[13:09:33] <smallville7123> Arahael: i am making my own api
[13:09:51] <Arahael> then you'll have to define how you track them yourself.
[13:10:22] <smallville7123> eg to convert SDL2 touch events into C++ MotionEvents very similar to Android's MotionEvent class
[13:10:40] <smallville7123> eg
[13:11:32] <Arahael> i don't remember how sdl2 does this.

[13:20:40] <Arahael> smallville7123: I wonder why.
[13:21:22] <Arahael> smallville7123: From what I can google, it seems to be supported about 5 years ago.

[14:53:22] <GeDaMo> Instead of an enum it would be better as a struct / object with two fields

[15:13:21] <Rounin> I suppose the standard answer would be some of the books written by Andrew S. Tanenbaum
[15:13:37] <user51> yeah, but he wrote qutie a few

[15:13:57] <GeDaMo> https://wiki.osdev.org/Books#Operating_Systems
[15:14:06] <user51> i was recommended 'modern operating systems'

[15:14:29] <Rounin> Computer Networks, co-authored with David J. Wetherall and Nickolas Feamster[15] (1981)
[15:14:29] <Rounin> Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, co-authored with Albert Woodhull[16] (1987)
[15:14:29] <Rounin> Modern Operating Systems[3] (1992)
[15:14:56] <Rashad> user51 for fundamentals, I took this one in university and it was pretty good: https://www.aberuk.com/education-professional/operating-system-principles-713.html but I can't compare it to other things so it might not be the best one out there

[15:25:05] <austincheney> anybody know what I have to do to have firefox echo to stderr?
[15:25:31] <Rounin> austincheney: Does it usually echo to stdout, or is it that it spawns child processes?
[15:25:37] <pyzozord> deniska: not sure I'm following
[15:26:01] <deniska> pyzozord: you give a fab some instruction to build a CPU, you can't guarantee they don't put something like Intel ME in it
[15:26:03] <Rashad> I still don't understand why ARM has an advantage over x86
[15:26:09] <Rounin> If it's just a stdout/stderr issue, you could go "firefox 1>&2" , but if it's due to not getting output from child processes I don't know
[15:26:30] <deniska> Rashad: arm is slightly easier to decode which gives some advantage… just not a lot
[15:26:44] <Rounin> Rashad: It might be due to lower power consumption, or due to licensing issues with x86, or both
[15:27:04] <austincheney> Rounin, I am running firefox with the -start-debugging-server flag and Mozilla says it should write to stderr but I see nothing to either stderr or stdout
[15:27:04] <Rounin> As for ARM vs. RISC-V, well, ARM has been around longer
[15:27:09] <Rashad> But how can an instruction set have an advantage in low power consumption?

[15:27:37] <Rounin> austincheney: Ah... Beyond me I'm afraid

[15:29:27] <deniska> Rashad: yeah, but I guess Apple would have to jump through way too many hoops to do that
[15:29:29] <pyzozord> Get any arch you want without involving a Fab
[15:29:42] <Rounin> Hmmmmmm well, FPGA won't give the best performance... Plus you never know what's in the FPGA
[15:29:44] <deniska> Rashad: subsets of x86 instructions are patented
[15:30:00] <Rounin> You kind of have to make the transistors from metals you mined yourself, in a universe of your own creation

[15:32:48] <deniska> fine for browsing facebook, not anymore for anything involving VMs or java :)
[15:33:04] <Arahael> And you definitely want 16 if you're doing dev work on it.
[15:33:21] <Arahael> 16, minimum.  Unfortunately that's also the max, but 16 is actually quite OK, at least for now.
[15:33:34] <deniska> 16 is fine for the next year or two
[15:33:39] <Arahael> Indeed.
[15:33:46] <Arahael> Will be interesting to see how Apple gets past 16.
[15:34:03] <deniska> I mean, it's just a question of adding more address lines :)
[15:34:29] <Arahael> Heh, sure...  But I imagine address lines are pretty crowded at that level of integration.
[15:34:40] <deniska> honestly "no more than 2 display devices" is a much more noticable restriction of m1 macs compared to intel ones

(in business rules terms, a message is a Fact). And I get one message per second from a socket. My rules (the equivalent of if/else conditions) should match multiple ordinary messages (multiple facts) as one pattern. So, example message(name=John, timestamp=12345) followed by
[18:21:48] <juliaEnv> message(name=Paul, timestamp, 6789) is the input. Rules are match message1: name=Jack, message2: name=Paul, 3s after message1. I expect it to match (message1, message2) as ONE match.

[19:46:17] <bjs> InPhase: if you can access it, it's shared.  I think it's trying to make a distinction with processes where you *cannot* access it

[19:47:40] <InPhase> bjs: If you have to guess a 64-bit value to access it, is it really shared?  That's more secure than most people's login passwords.
[19:47:42] <bjs> which is fair enough but I think the sentence might be missing some of the nuance of the levels of abstraction at play (the system's view of the "thread" and the programming language model's view of the thread)

[19:48:29] <bjs> that's the point it's trying to make (perhaps not so clearly)
[19:48:38] <InPhase> bjs: I can access your online accounts because they are on the same internet.
[19:49:05] <bjs> InPhase: i think it was pretty clear that sentence you quoted was trying to make the distinction between thread and process
[19:49:25] <bjs> and from the system's point of view, all threads share the same memory and they are allowed to access any part of any of it
[19:49:36] <InPhase> bjs: In so doing it says wrong things that mislead about how threaded programming is actually done though.
[19:49:48] <bjs> now programming languages may add their own level of abstraction on-top,  and that's why I said it was confusing the abstraction levels because it talked about "variables"
[19:50:12] <bjs> InPhase: not really, threads really can and do share memory. You can just give a pointer to another thread and it can use it
[19:50:20] <bjs> but for example, you *cant* do that with another process you fork()ed off
[19:50:31] <bjs> (or at least it gets far more complicated)
[19:50:46] <InPhase> bjs: Giving the pointer and keeping a copy of the pointer leads to sharing.  It is in fact HOW you share between threads.
[19:50:58] <bjs> InPhase: yes and threads allow you to do that?
[19:51:12] <bjs> I don't get why you have such a problem with the idea that threads share memory.
[19:51:36] <InPhase> bjs: But it's so dangerous and disruptive to multithreading it's not done for most variables, contradictory to it being the case for all variables at any given time.

[22:42:19] <pyzozord> I need to read the old unix man pages more
[22:43:05] <Izem> another problem is that I think a c compiler should have only required unix to build, but portability was a problem

[23:09:06] <GeDaMo> ROM is read-only but there are variations which you can alter
[23:09:24] <GeDaMo> EPROM and Flash, for example
[23:10:07] <Izem> does anyone store boot stuff in EPROM?
[23:10:37] <GeDaMo> Not on PCs anymore

[23:10:47] <GeDaMo> Yes, as far as I know
[23:11:30] <pyzozord> oh cool, ok so the actual real "rom" memory is really just "upload only once, it's going to stay that way forever"?
[23:12:05] <pyzozord> and the only way to change is to literally throw away the rom chip because it's useless and cannot be even refurbished
[23:12:06] <GeDaMo> Originally ROM was "programmed" during manufacture

[23:13:14] <user51> we only had one PROM at high school
