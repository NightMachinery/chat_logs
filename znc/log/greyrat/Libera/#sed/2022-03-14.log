[20:59:26] <Guest31> hi all, quickie .. hopefully some one can answer this  ..
[20:59:26] <Guest31> how can i use sed to enter a value into a quoted string ?
[21:00:31] <Guest31> for instance -
[21:00:31] <Guest31> sed -e 's/firstthing/second_thing = "$var"/g' file

[21:03:44] *** Quits: lgc (~lgc@user/lgc) (Client Quit)
[21:04:03] <Soliton> and what should that do that it doesn't already?
[21:05:13] <Guest31> hi soliton,its not properly transcribing  the variable
[21:05:35] <Soliton> are you trying to inject a shell variable?
[21:05:36] <Guest31> id get - "second_thing = "$var" "
[21:05:39] <Guest31> yup
[21:06:02] <Guest31> i tried ${var} , same effect , also tried to escape it .
[21:06:06] <Soliton> bad idea but you need to tell the shell to expand the variable then. nothing to do with sed.
[21:06:23] <Guest31> .. like echo it ?
[21:06:25] <Soliton> the shell does not expand anything in single quotes.
[21:06:46] <Guest31> its literal . got ya .
[21:07:05] <Guest31> if i try double quotes, sed errors out
[21:07:24] <Guest31>  unknown option to `s'
[21:07:24] <yitz> You may need to escape contained quotes
[21:07:36] <yitz> This is a shell string escaping problem
[21:07:38] <Soliton> probably slashes in the variable.
[21:08:44] <Soliton> if you inject arbitrary data into sed code then it will do arbitrary things. or maybe nothing if it's a syntax error.
[21:08:50] <larryv> also if you did it like this, it's still wrong: sed -e "s/firstthing/second_thing = "$var"/g" file
[21:09:24] <Guest31> yes, there is a / in the car
[21:09:26] <Guest31> >var
[21:09:37] <Guest31> its an IP addy , w/ mask
[21:09:44] <Guest31> 1.1.1.1/24 for example
[21:09:47] <Soliton> # var=/e#; sed -e "s/firstthing/second_thing = $var/g" <<< $'firstthing; firstthing; nextthing'
[21:09:49] <shbot> Soliton: sh: 1: second_thing: not found
[21:09:49] <shbot> Soliton: sh: 1: firstthing: not found
[21:09:49] <shbot> Soliton: sh: 1: nextthing: not found
[21:09:51] <Soliton> oops
[21:10:01] <Soliton> arbitrary code execution.
[21:10:57] <Guest31> i didnt think of the / causing an issue . good call .
[21:11:47] <yitz> You can use `s@@@` instead of `s///`
[21:11:53] <yitz> Or any other char
[21:12:59] <Guest31> yitz - that worked as expected
[21:13:05] <Guest31> you all rock!
[21:13:14] <Guest31> thank you so much for your help !@
[21:13:23] <Soliton> hopefully the variable content is not controlled by a potential adversary.
[21:14:08] <Guest31> one time thing ..  just to pull an ip/mask, gw ..
[21:14:11] <Guest31> into a ansible play
