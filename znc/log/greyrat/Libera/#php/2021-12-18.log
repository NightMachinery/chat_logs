[00:14:52] <judah> What are you folks opinions on working with long-EOL versions of PHP? Here is the situation: Client purchases a premium plugin and asks my workplace to install it. The clients site is using a long-unsupported version of PHP. This plugin will technically work, but the only version that will work is equally outdated. Since this old version of the plugin does not have all the features that the customer paid for, and
[00:14:52] <judah> likely has since-patched security issues, I do not believe I can in good faith assist in this task
[00:15:17] <__adrian> you would be buying into supporting it
[00:15:39] <__adrian> if you want to do that and can handle it, then you need to charge accordingly
[00:15:53] <__adrian> but in general, hell no.
[00:16:37] <__adrian> (and if you're referring to php, no - nothing that was unpatched when it went EOL is _still_ unpatched and _never will be_.)
[00:16:57] <__adrian> *everything
[00:18:05] <judah> My thoughts as well. Just feels icky.
[00:18:14] <Sammitch> if you say just how old the version of PHP is we can tell you how many feet long the pole should be
[00:18:28] *** OldStFlorida is now known as FloridaMan
[00:19:09] <__adrian> but that's the way to present it to the client - you will have more+bigger problems, it will cost a lot (on a subscription basis) to maintain, and would be better AND cheaper to get everything updated.
[00:19:44] <__adrian> depending depending, you might also offer a "we can upgrade the plugin" quote
[00:20:32] <Sammitch> yeah, that's what I tried to sell my previous employer on. "the clients can stick with EOL versions, but we should be charging them a premium to support it, and increasing that the older it gets."
[00:20:51] <__adrian> continuous subscription, too
[00:20:55] <__adrian> and no unapproved code changes
[00:21:13] <__adrian> this sounds absurd but people DO pay for this
[00:21:55] <__adrian> so don't just quote "high" assuming they'll choose the "upgrade" option  :p
[00:22:49] <da_wunder> that "upgrade" option could be really expensive one - seen that multiple times
[00:23:50] <__adrian> yeah, depends.
[00:24:14] <__adrian> but i've known people that quoted high and the client called their bluff
[00:24:15] <Sammitch> at one point our software was v4.x and we still had v2.x clients around, and every time they had an issue we had to hunt down the increasingly scarce "person who's been around long enough to have any idea which way is up in 2.x" which was ultimately the most senior devs who were working on far more important things.

[00:26:53] <Sammitch> so if every time this client needs something you have take extra time to go back and re-learn how to read/write/fix code in long-dead PHP 5.2, then you deserve to be paid for that extra effort.

[01:41:13] <judah> Yeah. My folks were pushing real hard for me to do something useful with my skills, so I spent the entirety of my savings buying refurbished servers and setting up a private data closet. I figured "if you build it they will come." Even ran some advertisements through a local marketing agency.
[01:41:37] <judah> Long story short, I now have a really dope minecraft server and less clients than I started with
[01:41:50] <judah> and also no money
[01:41:54] <judah> thats an important part of the story
[01:42:04] <da_wunder> I would just use some cloud provider for that
[01:42:22] *** Quits: Hash (~Hash@2001:470:f0b6::5) (Quit: https://hashsecurity.org)
[01:43:26] <da_wunder> marketing point of view, if you say that we run all in "cloud" will sell itself - that's what I've seen last years - everyone want to be in the "cloud"
[01:43:44] <judah> I am the cloud
[01:44:09] <judah> I did some TCO numbers and it ended up being far cheaper, even with double the worst case hardware failure rate, to just host it myself
[01:45:19] <judah> The thing is, the vast majority of clients just dont know any better. If they cant tell the difference between something I host and something on AWS, but I am 10% the cost, well there might be something to that
[01:46:06] <judah> The other side of the coin is that if a client knows they need a cloud server, they also know its cheaper elsewhere. If a client does not know they need it, they wont buy it

[02:15:50] <da_wunder> I don't use AWS so much, mainly I use GCP and it's like 50% cheaper than our self-hosting - and I'm talking like thousands of clients...
[02:16:44] <biberu> judah: is whatever you like sustainable?
[02:17:10] <da_wunder> ^
[02:18:41] <judah> Probably not. I started off hosting WordPress instances at $5/pop and that turned into a nightmare quick as nobody ever bothers to keep things updated. When I did the math last the ROI per client was something like -$400 over their average lifetime once you factored in the time it takes to clean the site a few times a year
[02:19:12] <da_wunder> sure using own servers within just a couple of clients might be less cost - but when you get more customers that will change really quickly - more maintenance and so on...
[02:19:12] <judah> but hey, have to start somewhere, and if your starting price is higher then the competition then its not looking good
[02:19:56] <biberu> starting so low it doesn't look like you'll be around next month isn't good either
[02:20:53] <judah> Oh I have been losing money for years and still cant keep the clients. Usually the way it works is they sign on for between 5 and 50 $/mo, the site sits idle for a few years, gets compromised, they blame me, I fix it, they take their site elsewhere
[02:21:22] <judah> I really wonder how the big players make it all work, but so long as I keep trying eventually something has to stick
[02:21:56] <judah> The best clients are high schoolers, ironically enough. Set up an easy Minecraft server and autopay on their moms credit card and never think about it again. Cant do that with real businesses though
[02:21:57] <da_wunder> that kind of monthly prices are quite low - imho

[02:24:39] <judah> biberu, In an ideal world I would be so far abstracted form the customers that neither of us has to ever know the other exists, thats the kind of customer I want. If I cant have that, at least somewhat educated customers who know what they want and can support themselves. Other programmers and the like. The catch here is that normal programmers know they can get a better service for cheaper elsewhere

[05:26:11] <__adrian> i.e., class A { private function z() {} }  and   class B extends A { private function z() {} }  are two separate methods. B::z() does not "replace" A::z().
[05:26:56] <__adrian> the php 8 error i'd guess you're referring to is that you ca no longer declare them "final" (for exactly this reason - they're not inherited, so "final" is meaningless).

[05:52:00] <robertparkerx> It seems the class only returns a object. I didn't write it so I don't know what it does. I only monitor the server for fatals. It's hard to var_dump when running the script directly doesn't return anything. It seems it's part of a python script that I can see from crontab -e.

[11:42:33] <GoSox> greetings
[11:42:59] <GoSox> question: does't the curl library in PHP use it's own root certificates or is it using whatever the installed curl program is using for root certs?
[11:43:35] <GoSox> or something else entirely
[11:48:16] <Blondie101010> I doubt there's any PHP involvement in the process, but I'm not 100% sure
[11:49:11] <AllenJB> Why are you asking? What problem are you trying to solve?
[11:49:23] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[11:50:11] <GoSox> since the LetsEncrypt root cert expiration in october, certain php shell scripts i'm running can't access letsencrypt domains. I'm just trying to find a fast bandaide to hold me over until I do a bigger upgrade
[11:50:36] <Blondie101010> update your system's CA certs
[11:50:45] <GoSox> on the OS, i was able to just download LE's root cert and that solved the problem for browsers. but php isn't using the system's certs
[11:50:46] <Rockwood> Blondie101010, o/
[11:51:17] <Blondie101010> GoSox:  do you have that problem with curl and/or wget on the command line?
[11:51:30] <GoSox> i think so but stand by, let me verify

[11:54:49] <Blondie101010> no
[11:55:37] <Blondie101010> how can you not know what you did?
[11:56:07] <Blondie101010> you tried to run your script to connect with curl on a URL and you don't have that URL?
[11:57:49] <GoSox> theres are several, i'm digging through the scripts to find one now
[11:58:09] <GoSox> i figured it would be faster if someone was using one for their site but hold on ill get an example
[12:02:57] <GoSox> so for example, https://index.commoncrawl.org/collinfo.json won't load in php's curl, but it does load in the browser and DOES appear to load in CLI curl
[12:03:07] <GoSox> i'm trying to grab the errors from php now
[12:04:27] <GoSox> error 60
[12:04:30] <GoSox> ssl certificate expired
[12:05:19] <GoSox> what does php's ssl use for certs? is there a folder with certs in it somewhere? does it use something else? it's clearly not using my OS's certs
[12:05:45] <Blondie101010> does `wget https://index.commoncrawl.org/collinfo.json` give an error?

[12:07:59] <Blondie101010> the isolation is done at the OS level
[12:08:13] <Blondie101010> look at how you installed PHP
[12:08:46] <GoSox> i don't understand your suggestion, what am i looking at?
[12:09:01] <GoSox> i installed php via homebrew package manager
[12:09:15] <Blondie101010> how did you install the cert for your browser to be ok?
[12:09:35] <GoSox> downloaded it through LE's website and installed it in the macos keychain app
[12:09:58] <Blondie101010> yeah, php certainly won't look at a keychain for certs
[12:10:23] <GoSox> nope
[12:10:36] <Blondie101010> https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ca-certificates
[12:11:24] <Blondie101010> not sure that'll do but it looks like a good thing to try
[12:12:05] <GoSox> i think i did try that back in november and it didn't work. let me check this with my server clone and see what's up there
[12:12:08] <GoSox> this will take a few minutes

[12:17:18] <Blondie101010> do try to install the certs with brew and clarify what doesn't work
[12:17:35] <GoSox> yeah a major root cert that a huge number of websites rely on, isn't usually let expire

[12:42:08] <GoSox> one thing i found out a few months ago when i was trying to fix this, was that the macports package manager has much better support than homebrew. but for some reason, everyone uses homebrew. i wish i knew this when i set up this server.  (smalltalk, still working on the server
[12:42:10] <GoSox> )
[12:42:46] <Blondie101010> use what suits you, as long as you maintain it, and that is not a #php topic
[12:43:25] <Blondie101010> it doesn't take 30 minutes to boot a computer and do a 2 minute test
[12:43:44] <Blondie101010> anyways, was interested in getting results, but guess it'll have to wait
[12:43:57] <GoSox> theres are a long list of reasons why its taking this long, like i knew it would
[12:44:09] <Blondie101010> ok
[12:44:09] <GoSox> the dummy server was not 'ready to go' and i knew that, but it's getting there
[12:44:44] <Blondie101010> sure, I'll see the rest when I wake up
[12:44:53] <GoSox> i'm pretty sure the brew package was a dead end, though i don't remember why. but that php config setting i think is a lot more promising
[12:45:13] <Blondie101010> it won't make the damn cert package appear
[12:45:43] <Blondie101010> so far you were a huge waste of time...  that should have been solved 20 minutes ago
[12:46:43] <Blondie101010> you have a messed up PHP installation on a desktop OS and yet you don't want to try fixing it
[12:47:13] <Blondie101010> my main suggestion would be to run your php on Linux, a VM or docker could do
[12:47:34] <Blondie101010> that way you don't need to rely on tons of crappy hacks

[15:29:18] *** Oclair_ is now known as Oclair
[15:29:56] <Bugz000> i wish to sort by arr["0"]["IDF0"]["DateTime"]
[15:30:30] <Bugz000> so arr["0"]...  1 2 3 4 may be 0 5 2 3 or whatever... man i am just butchering this
[15:30:58] <Bugz000> i want these images sorted newest to oldest and the date is found there in the exif lol
[15:31:35] <Bugz000> my brain is not cooperating today
[15:31:40] <GoSox> my not helpful answer: i had a similar problem recently and just imported the data into my database so i could just query it.
[15:31:47] <GoSox> but there is a way to do it, its just complicated
[15:32:10] <Bugz000> yeah at this point i feel it's almost straight denial that i haven't set up a proper CDN yet
[15:32:26] <GoSox> that just gave me an idea though, a method to access data in php arrays using sql syntax. that would be very cool
[15:32:52] <Bugz000> but i'll persevere for now :p i can work around the vasst majority of issues no CDN needed... i mean it's only a small hobby site (my own)... if it was anything commercial i'd have gone the CDN route a decade ago
[15:32:59] <grawity> Bugz000: usort() with a function that takes $a, $b and returns a comparison of $a["0"]["IDF0"]["DateTime"] and $b[same]
[15:33:08] *** Parts: GoSox (~GoSox@pool-71-174-247-109.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) ()
[15:34:03] <Bugz000> i did see usort but the usage was troublesome for me
[15:34:10] <Bugz000> i don't understand what it's doing
[15:35:05] <Bugz000> so if you give A and B it will tell you the difference?
[15:35:35] <grawity> usort wants *you* to provide the callback function that, if you give A and B, will tell you the difference
[15:35:39] <grawity> or not exactly the difference
[15:35:45] <grawity> just whether A should go before B
[15:35:56] <Bugz000> hmmt
[15:36:03] <grawity> if A before B, it returns -1
[15:36:13] <grawity> if A == B, it returns 0
[15:36:17] <grawity> if A after B, it returns 1
[15:36:30] <grawity> that's what usort expects basically
[15:36:31] <Bugz000> mmm
[15:36:41] <Bugz000> given the datetime is ASCIIBetical though it's not difficult to do this
[15:36:55] <Bugz000> i was hoping for a more autonomous solution though
[15:37:10] <grawity> yeah, then your callback function might be as simple as
[15:37:28] <grawity> fn($a, $b) => strcmp($a["0"]["IDF0"]["DateTime"], $b["0"]["IDF0"]["DateTime"])
[15:37:49] <grawity> strcmp is an existing example of a function that returns -1/0/1 in this way
[15:38:04] <Bugz000>  i did see strcmp used in another example
[15:38:07] <Bugz000> it seems this is the way
[15:38:42] <Bugz000> though it would be
[15:39:01] <Bugz000>  strcmp($Array["0"]["IDF0"]["DateTime"], $Array["1"]["IDF0"]["DateTime"])
[15:39:15] <Bugz000> run through and manually order in this way
[15:39:25] <grawity> oh, ["0"] is the array index?
[15:39:28] <Bugz000> yes
[15:39:42] <grawity> in this case fn($a, $b) => strcmp($a["IDF0"]["DateTime"], $b["IDF0"]["DateTime"])
[15:39:45] <Bugz000> i butchered the above description it's my own fault haha
[15:39:54] <grawity> I though each element had its own ["0"]
[15:40:02] <Bugz000> nooo that is the ID i wish to sort
[15:40:06] <Bugz000> using an internal value
[15:40:19] <grawity> right, so the 2nd example that I just gave, should work
[15:40:40] <Bugz000> where does the second array come from
[15:40:57] <grawity> from usort
[15:40:58] <Bugz000> $b ?
[15:41:38] <grawity> usort takes two *elements* from the array, and calls your function to compare them
[15:41:51] <grawity> so your function gets called with those two elements as parameters
[15:42:06] <grawity> repeatedly, until the array is sorted
[15:42:32] <Bugz000> OH
[15:42:35] <Bugz000> ohhhh that's clever
[15:42:46] <Bugz000> it is autonomous but with an entirely customisable stack
[15:42:57] <Bugz000> usort UNIVERSAL sort
[15:43:00] <grawity> hmm if you want to preserve the indexes you might want uasort() instead

[19:44:20] <nate> Did anything change between PHP 7.1 and 7.4 with how --with-openssl and --with-openssl-dir are handled?  I seem to be getting a compile error in ftp ext related to openssl ('undefined reference to `TLS_client_method`' among other things)
[19:44:38] <nate> only thing I can think is it's suddenly trying to use packaged openssl instead of my compiled one defined for those two switches
[19:45:44] <nate> Ah wait, no config.log seems to imply it is fetching from those directories just fine, weird.  Wonder if something changed in openssl 1.1.1 in a later build
[19:47:44] <AllenJB> nate: Check the NEWS and UPGRADING files in the php-src directory (or https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-7.4/ for "live" repo)
[19:49:43] <nate> Hm, nothing seems to be in there about openssl.  Weirder yet, config.log is making it look like... it finished building?  No reference to what I'm getting in console
[19:50:32] <AllenJB> I would also suggest googling the error message. Particularly for common libraries like openssl, even if the google result is for a completely different application it can sometimes help you resolve the issue

[21:33:40] <nate> Is there some particular way to get configure to show EXACTLY what openssl version it's trying to include beyond just it's version check of ">= 1.0.1"?  Cause everything I can see shows it should be including my 1.1.1 openssl yet these errors literally distinctly seem based on it including an older one
[21:35:59] <nate> I mean I even went so far as to try and explicitly define LD* environments with rpath but the error is still the same, almost like it's ignoring 1.1.1

[21:45:49] <Blondie101010> if you configured your environment specifically, why did you include the version you don't want?
[21:46:43] <Blondie101010> note that I do not know the specific linking it does but dynamic library linking is version based
[21:47:34] <Blondie101010> just remove the version you don't want from the environment, and see if configure picks up the right one or complains
[22:00:59] <nate> Blondie101010: I did /not/ include the version I don't want, I included the version I /did/ want.
[22:01:18] <nate> I just went back to my old 7.2 directory, it built fine, so something in 7.4's configure process must have changed

[22:36:06] <AllenJB> Is there a reason you're trying to build from source rather than use packages?
[22:36:09] <nate> Well so far 7.3 seems like it builds with the exact same configure line (minus --with-zip since it apparently didn't like my local libzip)
[22:36:34] <nate> AllenJB: CentOS, and because I usually do some fine tuning/tweaking and a few extra extensions
[22:36:45] <nate> And yes I did already try building a plain 7.4 without the extra extensions, same outcome :P
[22:37:50] <AllenJB> You can use Remi repo to install multiple / non-distro-supplied PHP versions on CentOS. It also has packages for quite a large selection of extensions
[22:38:52] <nate> for common/pecl extensions yes, not custom ones.  And while I could probably phpize it, easier to just statically build in lol
[22:39:22] <nate> anywhoot 7.3 successfully make'd, though it did throw; `/usr/bin/ld: warning: libssl.so.10, needed by /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.8.5/../../../../lib64/libldap.so, may conflict with libssl.so.1.1` at the end
[22:39:39] <nate> so might be relevant to my 7.4 issues perhaps
[22:39:47] <AllenJB> Doesn't seem like it to me from the amount of time you've spent here today!
[22:40:46] <nate> I mean I've been working on it off and on, don't assume I've been on it non-stop since your uh "Just google the error" recommendation :P
[22:41:26] <nate> So yes completely adding in new package handling to CentOS, then redoing the other extensions for that, etc probably still would have taken me just as long if not longer than hopefully this will be to figure out.  At the very least I now know it's explicitly a php7.4 thing lol
[22:41:39] <nate> so I just need to figure out what in PHP 7.4's compiler process changed since 7.3
[22:42:44] <nate> Ah
[22:42:45] <nate> https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.other-changes.php
[22:42:54] <nate> "--with-openssl no longer accepts a directory. "
[22:42:57] <nate> And there we go
[22:43:09] <nate> well what nitwit thought that was an acceptable idea lol
[22:43:59] <nate> So it's probably getting confused because --with-openssl is getting the packaged openssl and --with-openssl-dir is pulling my custom one, which would explain why I see reference to the compiled openssl but it's complaining about older openssl versions

[22:56:37] <put_in> hello, I have a question regarding the PostgreSQL DSN in php-pdo. The manual states that:
[22:56:42] <put_in> Note: All semicolons in the DSN string are replaced by spaces, because PostgreSQL expects this format. This implies that semicolons in any of the components (e.g. password or dbname) are not supported.
[22:57:02] <put_in> does that imply that spaces are not allowed either?
[22:57:03] <stenno> that doesn't sound right lol
[22:58:47] <__adrian> seems like it would imply that.
[22:58:54] <__adrian> have you tried?
[23:04:14] <__adrian> https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=62479  implies it was fixed some time ago. also note it only applied to passwords in the DSN (not when passed, as expected, as an argument)
[23:04:38] <Albright> DSNs are weird. Not a fan.
[23:05:06] <__adrian> yeah, don't like them
[23:08:11] <put_in> i am writing a parser which translates my .pgpass entries to DSN's and i want to do it cleanly and prevent potential malicious injections... but i don't speak C so i wouldn't know how to check up upon that
[23:08:45] <put_in> i'll probably prohibit ";" as well as " "
[23:09:07] <__adrian> ?
[23:09:28] <__adrian> pgpass uses a separator, :
[23:09:37] <put_in> yes. but DSN uses ;
[23:09:48] <__adrian> and what's this got to do with C ?
[23:10:01] <put_in> to see how php-pdo processes it
[23:10:15] <__adrian> ...no
[23:10:43] <put_in> lets say someone would define ;dbname=somethingelse inside the hostname column and i would process and overgive it to PHP-pdo unchecked
[23:10:44] <__adrian> again, have you checked? that bug report implies it was fixed.
[23:11:17] <__adrian> where are you getting your pgpass file? is it not trusted/authoritative?
[23:11:22] <put_in> yes, i have read your link. thank you very much
[23:11:36] <__adrian> > have you checked?
[23:11:44] <stenno> closed in 5.3
[23:11:47] <put_in> its on my local server and i just like to do things perfectly clean even if its trustworthy
[23:12:02] <__adrian> what i'm asking is, is there actually a problem?
[23:12:04] <stenno> well its not an issue anymore so
[23:12:08] <__adrian> because that implies there's not
[23:12:08] <stenno> why worry about it?
[23:12:19] <put_in> i think you both misunderstand me
[23:12:27] <stenno> unless you use ancient php which you don't as you 'do things perfectly clean'
[23:12:30] <put_in> let me restate my question:
[23:13:47] <put_in> i do not have any problems with spaces inside the password column but i would like to know if it poses a problem that any of the postgres column inside the .pgpass would pose any problems since postgres uses spaces to separate the arguments
[23:14:26] <__adrian> i understand. the bug i linked implies no. _have you actually checked_? have you actually verified that this is a problem?
[23:14:58] <__adrian> i'd like to hear yes/no to whether you've actually checked.
[23:15:09] <put_in> sure. no i did not
[23:15:11] <Blondie101010> put_in:  you sound like you're worried about settings you don't use...  I suggest you focus on reality and see if it simply works
[23:15:24] <__adrian> recommend you check. everything i can find implies this is no longer a problem.
[23:15:46] <__adrian> e.g., https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/199/files
[23:16:04] <put_in> Blondie101010: probably what the author of log4j thought too. (no offense! :-D)
[23:16:15] <Blondie101010> not relevant
[23:16:34] <__adrian> i'm not suggesting you make assumptions. i'm suggesting you check.
[23:16:47] <put_in> yes. thank you __adrian
[23:17:01] <Blondie101010> but please don't let anything or anyone access your configs
[23:17:16] <__adrian> if the bug report is correct, then no one remembered to update the note in the manual, so it's worth checking.
[23:17:23] <put_in> Blondie101010: of course not
[23:17:39] <Blondie101010> then simply validating whether it works or not is sufficient
[23:18:02] <__adrian> also, regardless of whether it's fixed, i'd recommend passing the username/password as arguments instead of in the DSN.
[23:18:47] <__adrian> i'd probably want to parse (and validate) the pgpass entries in advance, for that matter. store it for your php script in a more suitable format.
[23:19:57] <__adrian> probably wouldn't want php to have read access to those files :)
