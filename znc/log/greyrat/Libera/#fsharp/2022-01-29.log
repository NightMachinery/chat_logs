[10:01:13] <MatthiasVance> So what's the easiest way to use F# in a MVU pattern to get some HTML to a browser and communicate with a server? :D
[10:01:27] <MatthiasVance> Without dumb templates
[10:01:41] <MatthiasVance> So smart or blank templates are okay as long as they don't create 3 projects that have shitty naming "Client" etc
[11:30:18] <biberu> MatthiasVance: server side rendering?
[11:34:36] <MatthiasVance> I am not sure but now I think of Bolero
[11:35:51] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Open for any suggestion :D
[11:36:13] <MatthiasVance> I know a bit about Fable/Feliz/Bolero etc.. but not what makes sense and what has a nice developer experience
[11:36:37] <MatthiasVance> This person has a nice presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnm71YEt_lI
[11:36:49] <MatthiasVance> I see in the console that they use that it's Fable :p
[12:33:18] <biberu> MatthiasVance: for server side i'm aware of giraffe, bit haven't built anything with it, but http is kinda mvu by default ^^
[12:33:29] <MatthiasVance> Well not Elmish style MVU
[12:34:08] <MatthiasVance> I think I need 2 things, Giraffe for the API and then Fable or equivalent for a SPA
[12:34:29] <MatthiasVance> And then you can pick Fable.React but then you're stuck with React, I am not sure if that's a blessing or a curse
[12:34:54] <MatthiasVance> Usually picking a UI framework helps you with components and such, however.. not if your other framework (Fable) doesn't have bindings for it xD
[12:35:31] <biberu> have you seem the safe stack?
[12:35:38] <biberu> seen
[12:36:02] <biberu> didn't build anything with it either, but might be a useful search term of nothing else
[12:37:34] <MatthiasVance> I tried to use the *template* but even the clean version felt bloated with 3 projects
[12:37:43] <MatthiasVance> I'm more of a "show me what to include" person :D
[12:37:58] <MatthiasVance> I also don't think I'd want Saturn on the backend but rather plain Giraffe
[12:38:11] <MatthiasVance> Basically I know of all the variants but am not sure what the right pick would be xD
[12:38:18] <MatthiasVance> Other than backend now apparently
[12:39:17] <biberu> is it api+spa?
[12:40:18] <MatthiasVance> Everything was open, but yes I will be going that route
[12:40:45] <biberu> react is fine imo, but it's probably more important to pick something with a community around it, fable is already niche so if that's what's most popular...
[12:41:48] <biberu> not worth it to pick something cooler if the maintainers drop it or it's hard to get support, for react i guess it should be possible to adapt solutions for js/ts
[12:42:57] <biberu> maybe the maintainers of the bindings to fable get bored too, they are different things ofc
[12:52:15] <MatthiasVance> Indeed, given that F# is already not mainstream everything else you do on top of that *might* only make it harder :P

[13:57:46] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Do you like Paket? As in, prefer it over NuGet?
[13:57:57] <MatthiasVance> I think it's too much hassle for what it's worth
[13:58:10] <MatthiasVance> As in, I don't have the problems it solves
[14:08:45] <MatthiasVance> Except for the fact it might pull in older versions of libraries
[15:59:10] <biberu> MatthiasVance: tbh i didn't really give it a chance, i don't write scripts and nuget works fine for regular projects
[15:59:48] <biberu> maybe it solves a problem i'm not aware i'm having? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:46:02] <biberu> MatthiasVance: i had a look at the faq, and i don't think there is a problem with transitive dependencies and nuget since the packagereference format?
[16:47:02] <biberu> as for selecting between conflicting versions i think you can install the one you want manually, but that's a pretty bad idea in general
