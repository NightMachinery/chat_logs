[16:51:07] <FromDiscord> <Rika> uhhh why the cast?
[16:51:18] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> so that you can treat left and right like arrays
[16:51:25] <FromDiscord> <Rika> and if you're casting its addr arr1[0] is it not
[16:51:31] <FromDiscord> <gerwy> oh so swap could be used for pointers too, neat!
[16:52:05] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> since arrays have value semantics, `addr arr` is the same as `addr arr[0]`
[16:52:26] <FromDiscord> <gerwy> what if its two dimensional array? Should work too right?
[16:52:31] <FromDiscord> <Rika> oh yeah its an array
[16:53:03] <FromDiscord> <gerwy> okay i will try
[16:54:28] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> oh actually I guess in this example `cast[ptr array[3, int]](addr arr1)` would have been better
[16:54:38] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> since you know the length, you want checks
[16:54:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you dont need to cast right? does addr always return `pointer`?
[16:54:49] <FromDiscord> <gerwy> i will try bothâ†µthe first one doesn't output any errors, that is a good sign
[16:54:57] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> ohhh yeah

[16:55:16] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> I'm dumb xD
[16:55:56] <FromDiscord> <gerwy> actually UncheckedArray doesn't have pairs method, so i went with the second one
[16:56:13] <FromDiscord> <gerwy> and what is even better, is that i made a type of my array so i can place this instead
[16:56:57] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> yeah rika's solution is best ^^  I had my head in GBA land where I'm often dealing with C-style arrays of unknown length
[16:57:44] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> I'm looking forward to first class `openArray` for that reason

[22:59:46] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Or any other AST combination you want
[22:59:54] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> untyped doesn't have to be used as argument/return type, you can use typed or an actual type, or static, etc
[23:00:48] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> untpyped doesn't have to be a statement list; read the manual
[23:00:57] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> in an untyped AST all the identifiers are ident nodes (i.e. NimNodes with their `kind` field set to `nnkIdent`). Which means the compiler has no info on them besides their name
[23:01:47] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> meanwhile in a typed ast all the identifiers are sym nodes, you can query more information about them such as their type, their definition and such
[23:01:59] <fn> <11leth99> ok, i think i understand now.
[23:04:05] <FromDiscord> <Bung> @timotheecour you should have this PR https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/commit/16f0b556643a8a9cc73781de6d71d0041a194640
[23:05:04] <FromDiscord> <Bung> @timotheecour I dont know it's a bug or am lack of knowlege to generate a dll, so I post to forum for help.

[23:12:42] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> i can reproduce, and i understand the problem
[23:14:21] <FromDiscord> <Bung> is it need wait for something done or have a workaround ?
[23:15:55] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> i will send a PR in a few minutes as good-enough workaround, for the proper fix can i know how to do it but it's more involved
[23:16:10] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> (edit) "workaround," => "workaround;" | 04removed "can"
[23:16:42] <FromDiscord> <Bung> thank you!

[23:33:07] <FromDiscord> <PressF> Hey people.â†µI was trying out the ncurses binding that @Bung sent me earlier, but I have a problem I can't solve (propably because I'm a noob at nim and ncurses)â†µI'm trying to print  this `|`, but instead of displaying that, ncurses displays `~T~D`.â†µDoes anyone know what's the problem (I think it may be something related with this being from the extended ascii table)
[23:35:15] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> @Bung done => https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/18406
[23:43:28] <FromDiscord> <Bung> @timotheecour oh, I see , previousely it generate rtl symbols per module ?
[23:44:40] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> inclrtl is an include file, so the nimrtl was exported from all modules that included it => bug
[23:46:26] <FromDiscord> <Bung> yeah, that's bug
