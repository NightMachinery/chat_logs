[00:09:56] <da_wunder> having tests would make upgrade path quite clear and easy - specially when you've 100% coverage on your tests or at least close to that
[00:10:36] <da_wunder> and if someone doesn't have any tests - then that upgrade path is hard - you basically need  to check everything manually

[00:29:34] <relipse> maybe that's the idea of test-driven development
[00:29:47] <relipse> you force yourself to write tests before it gets written
[00:31:07] <biberu> it depends on the site ofc, but even some tests are a huge improvement over nothing
[00:32:14] <biberu> relipse: just having it in place and becoming familiar with it removes the threshold to writing new tests, so when you write new features or fix issues you can write tests for them as you go

[02:37:07] <Blondie101010> are we supposed to assume that you verified anything, including that the training record in the DB is good?
[02:39:26] <Blondie101010> now I looked at the code and without more details, it looks ok
[02:39:48] <Blondie101010> check your data, and add log traces
[02:40:16] <chazy> yes, i think i just found the problem
[02:40:45] <Blondie101010> what is it?
[02:42:08] <chazy> i forgot to subtract the hours: $start = (new DateTime($training->endTime, $timezone))->sub(new DateInterval("PT6H"));
[02:42:45] <chazy> i probably shouldn't hardcode that 6
[02:42:52] <chazy> but i think that's it
[02:43:34] <Blondie101010> hmmm, I kind of doubt that
[02:45:30] <Blondie101010> does your payment object store transaction details?
[02:46:56] <chazy> $start is supposed to be the date when the training starts, but if i assign it the time when it's supposed to end it, the difference between $start (which is start+max hours) and now would be 0 or minus whatever, the if > 0 or < max would never return true, would it?
[02:47:25] <chazy> i mean > and <
[02:48:05] <Blondie101010> so when it starts, you set $start to when it should end???
[02:48:15] <Blondie101010> if you do that, that's what needs to be fixed
[02:48:35] <chazy> yes, i think that was the problem

[02:57:50] <chazy> even when start is always going to be earlier than now? idk if that's what you meant
[02:58:25] <Blondie101010> that the number of hours is not cumulative
[02:58:34] <Blondie101010> if they keep it running for 24 hours, it will be 0 hours
[03:02:40] <chazy> oh your right, i have to fix that, thanks for pointing that out
[03:04:29] <chazy> so like just adding $diff->d > 0?

[03:14:13] <__adrian> i'm not suggesting you should hardcode it. configs are generally good ideas. you _do_ need to be aware of that case, though, as it means you can't support a max > 23. something to validate in your config.

[16:37:30] <relipse> so different order is ok?
[16:38:03] <relipse> like ['a'=>1, 'b'=> 2] is the same as ['b'=>2, 'a'=> 1] ?
[16:38:40] <biberu> is it also the same as [1, 2]?
[16:39:07] <velix> Okay, got it working: https://3v4l.org/VDO0T#v8.1rc3
[16:39:09] <relipse> keys and values have to be the same, but order doesn't matter and same types
[16:39:24] <velix> The problem was ksort ignoring the order of numeric and string.
[16:39:34] <velix> Forcing sorting by string is fine for me.
[16:40:02] <velix> Thanks a lot :)
[16:41:32] <velix> relipse: but yeah, the order doesn't matter. The type and value is important.
[16:41:43] <velix> like === but without order ;)
[16:41:44] <relipse> what is the context of your problem?
[16:41:55] <velix> relipse: testing output of an API.
[16:42:08] <velix> relipse: Sometimes the order isn't stable. but this doesn't hurt.
[16:42:17] <velix> relipse: but when the type changes: oh lord.
[16:42:20] <velix> red alert.
[16:42:31] <relipse> what does your api do?
[16:42:46] <velix> relipse: sorry for this simple answer, but it returns data.
[16:42:51] <velix> What do you expect me to answer? :D
[16:42:58] <relipse> what kind of data?
[16:43:04] <velix> relipse: numbers, strings.

[16:45:30] <biberu> velix: not sure how that function helps you in that context? don't you have a validation / mapping step that checks it before you let it into your application?
[16:46:19] <velix> biberu: Sure! But I don't know what the other idiots do and testing is important.
[16:46:53] <biberu> sure, testing is important, but your application shouldn't let bad data past the fences
[16:47:00] <velix> Why do you guys ALWAYS ask meta questions?
[16:47:05] <velix> PHP simply lacks a feature here.
[16:47:09] <velix> I've written a function that works.
[16:47:11] <velix> Case closed :-)
[16:47:29] <biberu> because it sounds like you aren't validating external inputs
[16:47:49] <velix> I'm feeling like a girl, who's asked to send pictures of her feet by those quiestions.
[16:47:54] <velix> What is it for?
[16:47:58] <velix> Why do you need it?
[16:48:02] <velix> How do you smell?
[16:48:05] <biberu> huh?
[16:48:19] <velix> relipse asked question, which are not needed to solve my question
[16:48:23] <velix> questions*
[16:48:25] <biberu> i'm not relipse
[16:48:50] <velix> And I'm not groot.
[16:48:56] <relipse> i like to get an idea or understanding of what it is being used for
[16:49:18] <velix> I know there are other ways to this. But I just wanted to have a second way to check it.
[16:49:40] <velix> The API is casting the data of course. But I want to run automatic tests whenever someone commits something.
[16:49:51] <velix> So I can run though all the API points now and check them to get the expected result.
[16:49:58] <biberu> casting isn't validation
[16:50:20] <velix> biberu: When '123' comes out, the application is broken.
[16:50:27] <velix> Where 123.0 is expected.
[16:51:25] <velix> Because then I know, that anyone did something unexpected.
[16:51:35] <biberu> are you validating your output?
[16:52:05] <velix> biberu: Right now? No.
[16:54:37] <__adrian> velix: i'm just casually reading the scrollback here, but yes, context is often important. it's about giving a better/useful answer to your question. nobody cares about your feet.
[16:55:11] <velix> I just want to compare two arrays. Order isn't important, value and type are important.
[16:55:18] <__adrian> also when people say "typesafe" they usually mean that type is important, not that it should be disregarded
[16:55:23] <velix> Why is more context needed here?
[16:55:37] <velix> "I want a Big Mac". - "Why?"
[16:55:42] <velix> I'd leave :-)
[16:56:15] <__adrian> i'd consider it important because it seems like a situation (and api response payload) where types shouldn't be expected to vary.
[16:56:26] <__adrian> order either, for that matter.
[16:56:53] <__adrian> so why are they different? this ssounds like the symptom of a different problem
[16:57:12] <__adrian> s/and/an/
[16:57:22] <velix> That's the point: When they're different, something wernt wrong!
[16:57:27] <__adrian> yes
[16:57:48] <__adrian> you don't fix the bad result. you fix the code that made the bad result.
[16:58:08] <__adrian> so i'd ask about what's causing the bad result.
[16:58:11] <velix> Because that's not the task. I just want to compare two arrays :-)
[16:58:15] <velix> Nothing else :)
[16:59:00] <__adrian> i would think you'd know by now that "because i don't want that answer" doesn't garner a lot of enthusiasm  ;)
[16:59:20] <__adrian> but if that's all you want, then go with your comparison
[16:59:51] <biberu> i'm still confused, so i'll try again, are you testing the output of your own api?
[17:01:10] <__adrian> that ^ is what it sounds like to me. but might be wrong.

[17:07:23] <velix> I really, really don't get why all this discussion and information is important to you :-)
[17:07:37] <velix> I just asked if there is a typesafe way of comparing arrays :-)
[17:07:38] <__adrian> i wouldn't have thought so but they did bring it up
[17:08:09] <velix> In German we call this "ein Fass aufmachen". in English it is "open a barrel" or "open a drum"?
[17:08:11] <__adrian> velix: see also my comment above re: the word "typesafe" - really seems like you want loose comparison here
[17:08:54] <__adrian> i get that you don't think context is relevant. tried to explain why it was. if you don't agree, that's ok.
[17:09:01] <velix> __adrian: Sorry, "typesafe" is a common term.
[17:09:32] <__adrian> yes it is
[17:09:50] <__adrian> and you seem to be using it to mean something uncommon
[17:10:31] <velix> __adrian: eh? Why?
[17:10:47] <velix> I want to compare '1' with 1.0 and get a false.
[17:11:15] <__adrian> ah... i thought you meant you wanted that to match

[17:12:33] <__adrian> dunno. but be aware that "comparing as string" doesn't accompish that: https://3v4l.org/toW96
[17:12:49] <stenno> "1" == 1.0 is true in both JS and php

[23:10:56] <acu> Hello Guys - I am runnning FreeBSD 13.0 with PHP8.0 and I wonder where I should increase the memory limit ?
[23:12:01] <AllenJB> The per-script PHP imposed memory limit is controlled by the memory_limit ini setting. Check the output of `php --ini` (if commandline) or phpinfo() (for web requests) for the location of the appropriate ini files.
[23:12:28] <AllenJB> (note that some distributions uses different ini files for web requests and commandline)
[23:13:13] <AllenJB> It can also be set at runtime using ini_set() (useful if you only want to raise it for select tasks)
[23:27:15] <acu> AllenJB thanks a bunch - I will check it now
[23:30:05] <chunk> AllenJB: you can run ini_set() in a script to on the fly change ini settings?!
[23:30:24] <AllenJB> A large portion of them, yes
[23:31:31] <chunk> so can i turn php_url_fopen and memory size that way then?  i tend to use laravel, i imagine this would work then
[23:32:58] <__adrian> prefer setting these things in your ini file
[23:33:06] <chunk> yea
[23:33:15] <chunk> security risks i suppose
[23:33:19] <acu> weird - I cannot find the php.ini in FreeBSD with php80 installed - https://pad.bsd.to/p/php80_ini
[23:33:28] <__adrian> and prefer NOT allow_url_fopen
[23:33:32] <chunk> use mlocate if it's available
[23:33:52] <chunk> __adrian: yes but mine is on however i have fail2ban guarding that
[23:34:01] <__adrian> acu: use phpinfo()
[23:34:15] <chunk> i had to turn it on to use composer for some odd reason
[23:34:25] <chunk> oh right, because one of my applications uploads
[23:34:31] <chunk> has an upload feature
[23:34:36] <__adrian> only reason i could imagine is not having curl installed
[23:35:02] <__adrian> you'd be hard pressed to find a legit reason.
[23:35:24] <AllenJB> allow_url_fopen cannot be set using ini_set() because it's PHP_INI_SYSTEM mode. See https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.modes.php and https://www.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php
[23:35:28] <chunk> it's an old application, i will take that into consideration while im rebuilding it thank you
[23:35:50] <__adrian> good point AllenJB
[23:35:50] *** Joins: jeffrey (~jeffrey@80-115-60-193.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl)
[23:35:55] <chunk> ok
[23:39:06] <acu> I found two files - but none ends with ini... root@cloud:/home/acu #  ls /usr/local/etc/php.ini*   /usr/local/etc/php.ini-development	/usr/local/etc/php.ini-production
[23:39:37] <chunk> hmmm...
[23:40:18] <acu> The question is - can I - do I have an option to Optimize PHP8 for size and number of files that can be uploaded  - that is in FreeBSD 13 with PHP80
[23:40:34] <AllenJB> acu: You're probably using default settings then. Those are "recommended" configurations shipped with php. You'll want to copy one to php.ini - which one depends on the purpose of the server.
[23:41:12] <AllenJB> acu: You need to set the ini settings post_max_size and upload_max_filesize to allow for more / larger file uploads via PHP.
[23:41:40] <AllenJB> (Note that this cannot be done at runtime because file uploads / post data are processed before you script runs)
[23:42:42] <acu> AllenJB, thanks - so I need to rename php.ini-production as php.ini ?
[23:43:27] <AllenJB> Yes
[23:43:49] <chunk> i suppose one would want to run phpinfo() again after to confirm it's being used
[23:44:00] <acu> OK - thanks, so PHP80 was running without a php.ini
[23:45:51] <acu> is there a cli command - phpinfo() is a webtool ?
[23:46:08] <chunk> you could run it interactively
[23:46:11] <chunk> i think
[23:46:39] <AllenJB> `php --info` on the commandline will give you full output. `php --ini` for just the ini files
[23:46:52] <chunk> php -a
[23:46:58] <chunk> is interactive mode
[23:47:25] <chunk> nope doesn't work that way
[23:47:27] <chunk> php -i
[23:47:42] <chunk> php is luv
[23:58:08] <acu> AllenJB, thanks a bunch - php --info gives a lot of stuff - I want to make sure REDIS and ACPU is properly configured too
[23:58:42] <acu> I am trying to use PHP8 and still figuring out how is structured etc... also I run FreeBSD 13
