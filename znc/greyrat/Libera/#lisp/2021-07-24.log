[22:24:28] <[itchyjunk]> Hi, I know nothing about lisp but am interested in it.
[22:24:48] <dash[m]> [itchyjunk]: Hi! it's a family of programming languages for computers.
[22:25:04] <[itchyjunk]> I watched a video where FP was inspired by lisp or somesuch
[22:25:18] <[itchyjunk]> I briefly tried learning haskell and found it was a bit hard for me
[22:25:50] <dash[m]> FP and Lisp developed together. But not all Lisp ideas are FP ideas or vice versa.
[22:25:53] <[itchyjunk]> I have a VPS server running ubuntu 20.04. how hard would installing something + getting to hellow world be?
[22:26:05] <[itchyjunk]> ah Lisp is independent from FP? didn't realize
[22:26:22] <[itchyjunk]> What's lisp generally used for?
[22:26:46] <dash[m]> Haskell has a few ideas not emphasized in lisp (like: lazy evaluation, mandatory static typing, and enforced referential transparency)
[22:27:45] <[itchyjunk]> ahh (I have minimum experience in programming in general. i am studying a little math and i hard first heard of lisp in the context of "AI" which i find very fascinating)
[22:27:48] *** Quits: mikeliuk (~mikeliuk@213.205.198.158) (Quit: Connection closed)
[22:28:05] <dash[m]> well, lisps are among the oldest programming languages, so a little of everything. famous examples are: the emacs text editor, AutoCAD, a few video games, various logic/expert systems platforms
[22:28:37] <[itchyjunk]> huh, looks like i can just `apt install sbcl` and have common lisp installed?
[22:28:53] <[itchyjunk]> oh emacs is coded in lisp? interesting
[22:29:12] <[itchyjunk]> AutoCAD? @_@ didn't know about that one..
[22:29:19] <aeth> ML (e.g. ocaml) and Haskell are the FP with static (usually manifest rather than inferred?) typing that generally are thought of as FP today.
[22:29:48] <aeth> Lisps have various degrees of FP in them, but generally made compromises for the sake of performance because the language family is really old
[22:30:28] <[itchyjunk]> Ah, old and not updated ? :S
[22:30:29] <aeth> Scheme, in particular Racket, is more purist as far as FP goes among Lisps. (Racket has immutable cons pairs.)
[22:30:35] <[itchyjunk]> don;t languages get updated regularly?
[22:31:39] <aeth> [itchyjunk]: I mean, yes, but what I mean is, you couldn't do pure FP in 1965. You just couldn't. So they're not as strict about not doing mutation as a newer FP, which doesn't mind not being able to run on any computer made before 2000, can be strict about.
[22:31:58] <dash[m]> Sure. There's a lot of different lisps of various ages, and lisps are uniquely able to add new language features via libraries
[22:32:16] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[22:32:59] *** Quits: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.134) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:33:07] <aeth> Lisps, being expression based, will do way less setting than almost any other language family because you don't need to set intermediate variables on e.g. the result of an if/then/else statement, because instead you're using the cond expression.
[22:33:16] <aeth> Lots of implicit return values.

[23:27:03] <aeth> yes, most things got rewritten in C++ in the '90s or even early '00s

[23:28:19] <aeth> AutoCAD still probably wasn't initially C++... Maybe initially C or ASM
[23:28:22] <aeth> Or Pascal.
[23:28:37] <[itchyjunk]> why is lisp used with CAD? is it a natural choice for some reason?
[23:29:09] *** Quits: Lycurgus (~juan@cpe-45-46-140-49.buffalo.res.rr.com) (Quit: Exeunt)
[23:30:10] <aeth> You have to remember that this was the old days and while many scripting languages do date to the 1980s or early 1990s (e.g. Lua 1993, Python 1991, Perl 1987), in practice the main historical alternative for scripting would have been Tcl (and even that's from 1988)
[23:30:11] <[itchyjunk]> The article recommends i read several books ^_^ the changes of me finishing books in general are very low
[23:30:25] <pjb> [itchyjunk]: lisp is a natural choice as an embedded language for all kinds of applications.
[23:30:38] <[itchyjunk]> ah..
[23:30:41] <pjb> [itchyjunk]: it just happens that AutoCAD is one famous CAD application using it.
[23:30:58] <[itchyjunk]> I have heard of lua and it appears in video games to allow modding communities to mod games i think
[23:31:04] <aeth> When you're writing something in, say, 1990, and your choices are Perl, Tcl, a custom Lisp, a custom BASIC, or your own custom language, then the custom Lisp seems like a fairly mainstream alternative.
[23:31:10] <wasamasa> lua wasn't a thing back then
[23:31:28] <aeth> right, even though Lua dates to 1993 and Python to 1991, you wouldn't have seen either until the '00s
[23:31:59] <aeth> So it's literally just Tcl, Perl, or your own custom language if you don't go with Lisp... and even if you write your own custom language, Lisps are easy because they make half of the language implementation (the parser) trivial
[23:32:06] <pjb> [itchyjunk]: so it's a way to develop applications too, starting from lisp, and adding the code to make the application, so you always have the REPL, and the possibility to write user scripts in lisp for your application.
[23:32:20] <pjb> [itchyjunk]: keyword: DSL Domain Specific Language.
[23:33:45] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[23:34:34] <aeth> a custom Lisp from the 80s/90s probably isn't going to be very good (even elisp is pretty bad and RMS had extensive experience with "real" Lisps)
[23:34:47] <aeth> But it has such a trivial parser that anyone can write a custom Lisp
[23:35:13] <aeth> no precedence rules, no keywords (Lisp keywords are totally different, just symbols in a certain package), etc.
[23:35:21] <aeth> Just read into a linked list, then handle those
[23:35:48] <aeth> hardest part is quasiquote but if your custom Lisp doesn't have that, few will notice
[23:36:12] <aeth> well, these days, the hardest part is probably the numeric parser, but in the 1980s nobody would've cared about half of those features
[23:38:42] <dash[m]> recent elisp is pretty good (now that it has real lexical binding)
[23:40:35] <aeth> yeah
[23:41:01] <aeth> I'm talking about 90s elisp, which is probably worse than you think :-p
[23:41:16] <aeth> and probably the source for most of https://emacshorrors.com/
[23:41:19] <dash[m]> Oh I've read plenty of 90s elisp (and maybe even wrote a little)
[23:41:36] <contrapunctus> dash[m]: username checks out
[23:42:16] <dash[m]> dispnew.c is the real emacs horror
[23:43:18] <[itchyjunk]> was there any connection between lisp and AI at some point? I could have sworn the first time i heard about lisp was in the context of natural language processing or somesuch?
[23:43:21] <aeth> anyway, this is just many words to say... there are three completely separate concerns as far as Lisps go: (1) easy to implement (trivial parsing), (2) minimalist, (3) features it offers. All three are somewhat opposed to each other (since minimalist-to-the-user can be very hard to implement)
[23:43:51] <dash[m]> [itchyjunk]: A lot of lisp development was done at the MIT AI Lab in the 60s/70s
[23:43:55] <aeth> Embedded Lisps prefer #1 even if it's... barely usable as a Lisp and missing most of the things people like. Schemes tend to prefer #2 (seeing that as the most elegant), but there are others that also try to build an elegant core.
[23:44:07] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[23:44:23] <aeth> Lisp really isn't used for AI anymore, with few exceptions
[23:44:44] <dash[m]> "AI" is a very vague term anyway, the only real meaning is "stuff we don't know how to make computers do"
[23:44:50] <aeth> These days, "AI" is machine learning, which means C++ libraries that talk to Nvidia GPUs via CUDA, wrapped in some trivial Python layer running in Jupyter Notebooks in the browser.
[23:45:16] <aeth> early 1990s AI was a completely different set of techniques, and often used Common Lisp or similar Lisps (e.g. Lisp Machine Lisp, Interlisp, Maclisp).
[23:45:18] <dash[m]> "AI" means "Artificial Inelegance"

[23:46:17] <aeth> An important distinction between "old" and "new" AI is that old AI was mostly symbolic and was about rules. Enumerating all rules. Modern AI is machine learning, and is mostly just numeric optimizations of linear algebra, which modern hardware is really good at doing. But nobody understands why ML does what it does, it just does.
[23:46:34] <aeth> Lisps were mostly used for the "old-fashioned" rule-based AI
[23:46:52] <[itchyjunk]> Is the era of rule based AI gone?
[23:47:05] <dash[m]> no, it's just "rules" now instead of "AI"
[23:47:06] <aeth> When the Cold War ended and government funding dried up, that was it for that era of Lisps. It didn't help that they overpromised and underdelivered what the AI could do.
[23:47:25] <aeth> I mean, this sort of thing still exists, it just isn't a popular/overhyped field anymore
[23:47:40] <aeth> A compiler is "AI" along these lines, in many ways
[23:48:07] <aeth> But you don't talk about AI, you just talk about "optimizing compilers" and if you were to talk about "AI in compilers" you'd probably mean machine learning, not the stuff that's boring and mundane these days.
[23:48:24] <aeth> But imo optimizing compilers absolutely are AI by 1980s standards.
[23:49:08] <aeth> You have transformation rules that you do to replace naive A with efficient B, and it can get very sophisticated.
[23:50:16] <aeth> Traditional AI-as-AI is probably mostly in games, especially chess. Although chess in particular is doing a lot of machine learning now, too.
