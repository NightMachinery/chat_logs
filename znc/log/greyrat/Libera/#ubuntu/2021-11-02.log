[00:37:08] <Afdal> So I recently moved off of *buntu to another Debian derivative and I'm getting an audible speaker pop every time pulseaudio opens a new sink.  This never happened to me back when I was on Ubuntu, and I'm wondering what kind of secret settings Ubuntu must have applied to prevent it.

[00:39:32] <Afdal> I don't have a clue where I might begin looking among these patches
[00:40:26] <Afdal> Even something as simple as my browser playing a chime when a download completes produces a speaker pop because it has to briefly open a new pulseaudio sink to do it.  It's so irritating.

[00:44:38] <i-garrison> Afdal: there could be two places original configuration was different, pulseaudio module-suspend-on-idle is commented out in default.pa which causes pulseaudio to not suspend the device, and kernel alsa driver powersaving turned off causing driver not to let the device sleep

[01:04:34] <cbreak> determine if it is 32 bit or 64 bit. I'm assuming it's x86.
[01:05:08] <cbreak> (it's probably 64 bit)
[01:05:22] <Bashing-om> wfpkhc: See too: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements/ .
[01:05:31] <wfpkhc> windows xp - assume 32bit
[01:05:47] <wfpkhc> how do i find out - will it be in the bios?
[01:06:12] <cbreak> if you find out the exact CPU, you can look it up

[01:06:50] <wfpkhc> 1.4
[01:07:01] <wfpkhc> 1.4ghz
[01:07:40] <Afdal> Okay so toggling load-module module-suspend-on-idle definitely turns popping on and off.
[01:07:49] <Afdal> So it is related to device idle suspension
[01:08:16] <Afdal> Now what I'd like to know is what other arcane setting Ubuntu must have altered to obviate that without altering that setting
[01:08:29] <i-garrison> Afdal: since disabling suspension worked to get rid of the pop, you can either use that as a workaround or dig deeper into alsa kernel driver differences + alsa module parameters differences between new and old
[01:08:32] <cbreak> hmm... 32 bit probably, yes
[01:09:04] <cbreak> you might want to go with one of the less resource intensive flavors on https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours

[01:10:18] <i-garrison> Afdal: digging deeper will be very entertaining :) it could be literally anywhere from module parameter somewhere in /etc to obscure backported or ad-hoc patch to kernel for specific hardware

[08:12:57] <usbdd> No, can you please paste it again, for some reason webchat disconnects
[08:13:27] <alkisg> Yes because your drive has a different size than the iso
[08:13:42] <alkisg> If you only check the first X bytes, it should be the same
[08:14:17] <usbdd> I did specify bs and count correctly when doing dd command feeding data to sha256sum
[08:15:18] <usbdd> Actually, i played with it, and it is the first (head) bytes that are different …
[08:15:39] <[code]> if you want to check the data was downloaded successfully then check the checksum on the iso. if it matches then you downloaded it successfully. the disk has a different size and won't generate the same checksum unless you constrain the comparison to the same number of bytes as the iso
[08:15:45] <alkisg> Which commands are you running exactly?
[08:16:06] <usbdd> I did diff on last  (size-4K) and they were identical
[08:16:15] *** Joins: HyN0X (~HyNoX@151.35.59.99)
[08:16:16] <alkisg> Also, when Ubuntu.iso boots, it again md5sums the contents
[08:16:21] <[code]> also deb packages have builtin checksums. if you're concerned that your usb drive is bad or some how faulty, you'll get errors if it is as it installs
[08:17:11] <usbdd> Yes, but what if my system that I used to dd original iso into USB is tainted?
[08:17:26] <[code]> usbdd: then check the pgp signature
[08:17:58] <usbdd> But if the system I am running it on is tempered, how would that help?
[08:18:01] <[code]> you can cryptographically verify it wasn't tampered with by verfiying the gpg signature.

[08:18:53] <alkisg> If they tainted ALL executables, including dd and gpg and shasum, then ok. How possible do you think that is?
[08:18:57] <[code]> usbdd: at some point you're gonna have to "trust"
[08:19:12] <[code]> if not go off and write templeOS 2.0 and share the crazy
[08:20:10] <[code]> usbdd: more seriously. do you have a reason to suspect your machine is not trustworthy?
[08:20:48] <usbdd> So, I thought I would boot from USB, and run sha256sum on the USB, making sure it matches the advertised sha256sum … but it is not, because as it looks to me, when Ubuntu boots from USB, it writes something small at the beginning of the USB.  I am not sure if it is the Ubuntu, or perhaps the boot loader?
[08:21:30] <[code]> i don't think i've ever seen a rootkit or common hacker tools that patch dd to look for writing an ubuntu executable and inject compromised executables in to the usb disk. there are far easier ways in to a system than that. that's a bit "contrived"

[10:06:46] <ivo_> Ohhh no it hasn't. It is the minimal server aarch64 version. I am using it on a mac mini m1. So needed to go a differen troute with the instalation.
[10:07:26] <KBar> I see. That's why you need to be more specific.
[10:07:28] <ivo_> I did the minimal install and than apt installed the ubuntu-desktop. And sadly there was no grafical app store
[10:07:44] <KBar> Not familiar with servers, sorry.
[10:07:45] <ivo_> Kbar, you are right :).
[10:08:22] <ivo_> *I use it as a desktop ... but the non functioning app store ui is annoying
[10:09:03] <ivo_> the snap-store works better, maybe will switch
[10:09:50] <KBar> snap-store is the default now.

[10:10:52] <nshire> my rpi on 21.10 doesn't want to connect to wifi with the appropriate settings in network-config
[10:10:57] <KBar> Yes, it doesn't support flatpaks.

[10:14:29] <KBar> ivo_ well, it's good to report it asap, because you may forget about the problem after you've found a workaround. But of course it's up to you.
[10:15:14] <KBar> nshire no, it doesn't. Is the connection at least listed?
[10:15:36] <nshire> its running headless
[10:16:29] <ivo_> Ohh KBar I just realized ubuntu-bug is an app I can just execute. I'll report it right away.

[14:38:23] <pikapika> Can this clonezilla store the image in an external hard disk or something

[14:42:22] <zetheroo> Yes, you can either make a clone to image, or clone directly to another disk. You can only restore an image to a disk the same size as the original or larger.
[14:43:01] <zetheroo> The size of the image will be more or less the size of the the disk space used, not the full disk size.

[14:44:02] <zetheroo> If you restore the image to a disk larger than the original, you can use an Ubuntu LIVE session (gparted) to resize your restored partition to fill up the whole disk.
[14:44:59] <pikapika> Since its an independent live iso I imagine choosing the Debian version or the Ubuntu version of clonezilla should not make much difference right?
[14:46:29] <EriC^^> yeah shouldnt be much different
[14:46:52] <zetheroo> Right. I have used both (the the Debian more often) and they both perform the same functions more or less.
[14:47:28] <zetheroo> main difference I noticed was if I used the cmdline
[14:48:59] <pikapika> If I keep a manual migration as the alternative, what are the files I should copy over besides the home directory configs, theme files etc
[14:50:01] <EriC^^> basically get the list of installed packages, reinstall on fresh install
[14:50:41] <pikapika> Yeah obviously thats the first step
[14:50:46] <pikapika> after which I copy over my configs
[14:50:49] <pikapika> and theme files
[14:50:53] <pikapika> any other files of note to copy over?
[14:51:08] <EriC^^> this should get you close to them, need to fine tune a little "comm -23 <(apt-mark showmanual | sort -u) <(gzip -dc /var/log/installer/initial-status.gz | sed -n 's/^Package: //p' | sort -u) > ~/installed_packages" then use sudo xargs -a installed_packages apt-get install -y
[14:51:19] <EriC^^> that's about it, for a standard install
[14:51:21] <pikapika> Oh of course
[14:51:29] <pikapika> I might do some manual pruning first
[14:52:02] <pikapika> because some of that stuff might be outdated dependencies in the new install
[14:52:04] <pikapika> but yeah

[21:33:37] <tomreyn> coconut, leftyfb: there is a mechanism for transitions from apt packages to snaps, i.e. installing chromium-browser on (maybe not just) >= 20.04 using apt would install a pseudo package which then ensures snap is installed (installs if not so, i think) and then installs chromium using the snap CLI.

[21:39:11] <tomreyn> i assume this mechnism is also used for other packages in this and later releases where the .deb was effectively replaced by a snap, though - such as Firefox.
