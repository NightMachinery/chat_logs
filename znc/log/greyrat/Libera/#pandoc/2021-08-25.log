[15:22:00] <ede> hi. pretty empty here (wasn't this channel bigger in the past?). anyway...
[15:23:04] <ede> i want to quickly hack an overview of some items using shell scripting and some text files to create a html. everything so fine so far, only i'd like to tag the items, that's apply a class to them. any idea?

[15:23:58] <ede> i know some wikis allow this, but can't even remember which ones, or which markdown addons or variants do.
[15:24:55] <ede> btw i don't care if it's a list or a simple table, i'd just create a table template around the data in the script if necessary, so far i have entries in the form of `* item`

[18:56:04] <leah2> i'm updating pandoc, and the smart filter now converts `foo "quux", bar` to `foo “quux,” bar`
[18:56:16] <leah2> can i make it not move the comma?
