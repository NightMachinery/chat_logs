[15:28:06] <s-liao> Bunny351 Thanks, but what I understood is that the chicken-doc egg to explore the document of chicken in REPL, The chicken-doc-admin egg create and modify a Chicken documentation, let us say, a new egg is installed, its document will be added into the document repository.
[15:28:56] <Bunny351> ah, yes, indeed. chicken-doc-admin is the one
[15:29:11] <Bunny351> sorry, I got that wrong
[15:30:18] <s-liao> That is Okay. And also most of the installed eggs in my side, there is not wiki pages in the source package.
[15:30:48] <Bunny351> no, the wiki documentation is in a separate repository
[15:33:06] <s-liao> Yes
[15:37:23] <vandusen> SPAM! SPAM! SPAM! by freeee
[15:40:29] <s-liao> Then we have a server to host the wiki documentation.And install chicken-doc egg along with Chicken documentation repository.  Then we have explore the document of chicken in REPL.
[15:40:42] <s-liao> Then we can explore the document of chicken in REPL.
[15:41:32] <s-liao> But how can the wiki documentation to create documentation repository of Chicken ?
[15:42:11] <Bunny351> the wiki pages are in a subversion repository
[15:43:57] <s-liao> you mean https://wiki.call-cc.org/ like view wiki page in subversion repository?
[15:44:08] <Bunny351> https://code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/wiki
[15:44:38] <Bunny351> user "anonymous", password "" (empty)
[15:44:45] <s-liao> Okay
[15:44:50] <Bunny351> eggref/5 is the path
[15:44:58] <s-liao> it is all the pages files
[15:45:32] <Bunny351> there you find all the wiki pages, man/5 holds the CHICKEN manual
[15:45:33] <s-liao> What is the server hosting the https://wiki.call-cc.org/
[15:45:45] <Bunny351> ?
[15:47:21] <s-liao> There is search function in https://wiki.call-cc.org/. and in the https://api.call-cc.org/5/doc/ page can search identical  as  well.
[15:48:58] <s-liao> What I am looking for that combining the index of identifies 偶发the data source of both of them
[15:49:18] <s-liao> What I am looking for that combining the index of identifies of the data source of both of them.
[15:50:03] <s-liao> Not sure it is possible.
[15:51:40] <s-liao> I mean one data source for this index of identifies for  https://wiki.call-cc.org/ and  https://api.call-cc.org/5/doc/
[15:52:18] <Bunny351> Isn't this already what chicken-doc is doing?
[15:53:15] <Bunny351> I'm not familiar with the details. you might also want to checkout http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/manual-labor
[15:53:17] <s-liao> chicken-doc is based on the documentation repo
[15:53:58] <Bunny351> the wiki svn repo _is_ the documentation repo
[15:55:30] <s-liao> The only point what I try to figure out is whether they share the same index of identifies.
[15:57:58] <s-liao> Last time, I talked with wasamasa, there is an issue about to search find-file-pathnames in  https://api.call-cc.org
[15:58:19] <wasamasa> yes, it's a bug
[15:58:34] <s-liao> But find-file-pathnames can be found out in  https://wiki.call-cc.org/
[15:58:46] <wasamasa> the solution for dealing with a bug is to fix it, not rewrite all the software surrounding it
[15:59:10] <s-liao> Yes. you are right.
[15:59:27] <wasamasa> even if GNOME programmers may make it appear that way
[15:59:53] <wasamasa> "There's lots of bugs in our software? Let's just rewrite it and pretend the rewritten software has no bugs!"
[16:00:05] <s-liao> But the root cause is that it is needed one true index of identifies data source.
[16:00:10] <wasamasa> no
[16:00:27] <wasamasa> you're not understanding the bug at all
[16:01:08] <wasamasa> the wiki has documentation pages explaining how egg procedures are supposed to be used
[16:01:20] <wasamasa> there is software that scans these documentation pages and creates an index
[16:01:31] <wasamasa> due to a bug in that software, the index does not include every egg procedure
[16:01:52] <wasamasa> therefore the API lookup using the index cannot find every single procedure on the wiki (such as find-file-pathnames)
[16:02:19] <wasamasa> it's not about having one source of truth, it's about generating the index in a less stupid way
[16:03:08] <s-liao> Yes. that is what I try to figure out and think, the if the index should be put in the design phase like in srfi document.
[16:03:59] <wasamasa> again, I have fixed the bug
[16:04:01] <wasamasa> there is a patch
[16:04:19] <wasamasa> it just needs to be applied by Jim
[16:04:36] <wasamasa> your ruminations are a waste of time
[16:07:29] <s-liao> Mostly the process of developing packages, like you say, have the documentation of the pages of the developing the package, then generate the manual for the end user.
[16:08:23] <s-liao> Okay.
[16:11:22] <s-liao> What I mean that the index of the identities can be put in the design phase.
[16:12:03] <s-liao> Any way, that is your guys decision.
[16:12:35] <wasamasa> what use is a design document when we're looking at an implementation issue?
[16:16:30] <s-liao> Yes. But It depends on what kind the implementation issue is, then find out the root cause , and find the way to avoid it.
[16:23:33] <wasamasa> root cause: humans write software
[16:23:42] <wasamasa> avoid it: forbid humans from writing software
[16:23:44] <wasamasa> easy
[16:26:50] <s-liao> design, collaboration, following  the improving process  can make less bugs.
[16:33:05] <s-liao> Any way,I have not have any proved concept. That is no way for me to judge it too much.
[16:37:13] <s-liao> But the repeat the function is not necessary on the website, if there is the function of searching identifies on  https://wiki.call-cc.org/ and  https://api.call-cc.org are same.
[16:37:28] <wasamasa> they aren't the same
[16:37:34] <wasamasa> they are implemented in different ways
[16:37:48] <wasamasa> I use api.call-cc.org for identifier search and wiki.call-cc.org for full text search
[16:38:07] <wasamasa> the identifier search on wiki.call-cc.org seems pretty bad
[16:38:21] <wasamasa> but that's no reason to rip it out
[16:38:32] <s-liao> Yes. that is what I mean.
[16:38:39] <wasamasa> no, it's not
[16:38:57] <wasamasa> you haven't realized the "but that's no reason to rip it out"
[16:38:59] <wasamasa> part
[16:39:29] <s-liao> Okay. But but the same in term of identifier search
[16:41:41] <s-liao> The reason is there is the issues in the identifier search on api.call-cc.org.
[16:41:58] <wasamasa> your argument is going in circles, so I'll stop talking to you
[16:42:28] <wasamasa> it doesn't help that your English is awful and hard to understand
[16:45:41] <s-liao> Not circles. the reason is about the true of the index identifiers, is it in the design phase like in the wiki page, or the generated./chicken-doc repo.
[16:51:17] <s-liao> Both has the winning point, wiki page is starting with the design phase, it is the first point for the index identifiers. But was not stored in s-exps and can not be RESTFUL,  api.call-cc.org have a s-exps as stored format and can be RESTFUL easily.
[16:56:25] <s-liao> I think now it is much clear. It is still in the developing process, the index identifiers in the https://wiki.call-cc.org/ is 'true', and its store format s-exps is still in the developing process.
[16:58:17] <s-liao> If I am wrong, feel freely correct me.
[16:58:42] <s-liao> wasamasa there is not too much argument, it is more about how it can be clear.
