[02:06:53] <artao> i was jammin on the volca sample, making a new beat and stuff ... accidentally saved over another beat I'd made for a totally different song <sigh>
[02:06:54] <artao> :(
[02:07:01] <artao> and this new one doesn't fit that song
[02:07:06] <artao> <sigh>
[02:07:10] <artao> FFFFJDKUUUCK
[02:09:23] <louipc> hate when that happens
[02:09:47] <louipc> i guess just record every session
[02:09:57] <louipc> can listen back
[02:10:12] <artao> yeah
[02:10:31] <artao> thankfully i DO have a couple takes of jamming with that rhythm. i should be able to recreate it well enuf
[02:10:34] <artao> still
[02:10:35] <artao> <sigh>
[02:10:37] <louipc> oh good
[02:10:46] <artao> i paniced more at first cuz i forgot i had it recorded LOL
[02:11:15] <louipc> i dont get how ppl get time to bother to listen back to old takes to find lost jems tho
[02:11:26] <artao> and, again ... i seriously need to put new samples on the volca LOL
[02:11:29] <louipc> maybe i just hadnt been in the process that long tho
[02:11:32] <artao> these kicks just lack meat
[02:11:43] <artao> i lo-fied everything i put on it this time
[02:11:47] <louipc> well i definitely havent been in the process that long
[02:11:52] <artao> 8-bit 24khz
[02:11:53] * louipc shrug
[02:11:57] <artao> no .. 16-bit
[02:12:01] <artao> 8-bit was too ganky
[02:12:02] <artao> lol

[02:12:09] <louipc> :p
[02:12:20] <louipc> no 9
[02:12:24] <artao> 12
[02:12:27] <artao> :P
[02:12:34] <louipc> ok dirty dozen
[02:12:58] <artao> and fewer samples. i'm really only using the volca sample basically as a drum machine plus sound effects

[02:22:52] <artao> and, now, rebuilding the beat <sigh>
[02:23:00] <artao> the hard part will be getting the sounds right
