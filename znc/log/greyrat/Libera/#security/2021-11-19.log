[11:29:40] <Hash> Kerchhoff's Principal: A cryptosystem should be secure, even if everything about the system is publicly known. <- This clearly means that if everything is known, including the keys, there is no security, so it's a GIVEN, that keys must be protected.
[11:30:10] <Hash> To argue this point, is to create an argument for no reason, just to aruge. Then ridicule the person, literally half a day later, and keep this ridiculing going.
[11:31:00] <Hash> Obviously, it's a GIVEN, to ANYONE with a brain, that if you know the keys, you can decrypt all the informtion. This is a GIVEN. So, what I said was 100% accurate. You're adding your bit in just to argue.
[11:31:10] <Hash> Which is why I said: Hash | Are you arguing against his principal which holds true in the world of cryptography?
[11:31:48] <Hash> Apachez | if I know your algo and I know the keys you are using then your cryptosystem is no longer secure <- Correct. Why would you assume keys are also public knowledge?
[11:32:22] <Hash> Why would you assume that? Just so you can argue? Okay. But it's a made up argument, like I said before. Please try to catalyze more and not instigate or argue or ridicule people.

[11:46:04] <Hash> Now the real caveat here is that assuming the algorithm is mathematically sound, then these facts hold true. If the algorithm is not sound, then a larger block size or larger key size may have little impact on security. This takes us back to the previously mentioned Kerchoff’s principle. It is important that any cryptographic algorithm be rigorously examined by mathematicians and cryptographers

[11:46:22] <Hash> And not to use security by obscurity by trying to keep the algorithm hidden.
