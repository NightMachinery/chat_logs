[02:40:44] <hunterkll> like "been here so long full company spread retirement parties " type shit
[02:40:58] <hunterkll> "Oh yea heres a picture of our basketball team from ~30 years ago when I started blah blah blah"
[02:41:17] <mistiry> before the VC money came into the last place,it was that way. 
[02:41:32] <mistiry> the average tenure when they bought us (we were the first acquisiton) was like 18 years
[02:41:48] <hunterkll> yeesh
[02:41:50] <mistiry> couple dozen 20+ year folks
[02:41:53] <hunterkll> glad I don't really have to worry about that much 
[02:41:57] <mistiry> a few 30+ years
[02:42:07] <mistiry> i think 2 40 year (like, day one employees)
[02:42:40] <mistiry> they offered early retirement to folks over i think 25 years.
[02:42:45] <mistiry> paid them off VERY well
[02:42:57] <hunterkll> heh
[02:43:04] <mistiry> and then massively expanded staffing with much lower paying junior roles
[02:43:07] <hunterkll> bet it was cheaper than what they'd have gotten otherwise though (to the company)
[02:43:17] <mistiry> yep. their salaries were insane
[02:43:24] <mistiry> plus they had stock
[02:43:29] <mistiry> before that VC cash rolled in
[02:43:34] <hunterkll> shit
[02:43:59] <hunterkll> need another war before i start buying stock

[03:05:20] <Work-BWMerlin> I have locked down our student machines so it throws an error when they login, that error is because they cannot run things from appdata
[03:05:26] <Work-BWMerlin> So now I need to fix that
[03:05:32] <xe0n> well it still uses appdata lol
[03:06:01] <xe0n> it just stores some binaries in wherever it does, but you still appdata there
[03:06:04] <Work-BWMerlin> My options are, fix my office install to include OneDrive (good idea) or push OneDrive down as a seperate install (not a bad idea but probably not as a good as first option)

[03:06:23] <xe0n> how have you "locked" down appdata
[03:06:31] <xe0n> app data is a user profile folder...
[03:06:40] <xe0n> you sometimes need to execute things from there...
[03:08:19] <Work-BWMerlin> I just don't allow applications to run that are not in programme files

[03:08:45] <Work-BWMerlin> Software will install into programme files
[03:10:29] <xe0n> yeahh and some apps put stuff in there that needs to execute
[03:10:42] <xe0n> i would look at how you're doing things, or work off white listings
[03:10:50] <xe0n> not just blanket stop executables from being there
[03:11:03] <xe0n> and onedrive still stores stuff in appdata even on a per-machine install :)

[03:20:00] <hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin, you basically have to accept that at least onedrive requires running from appdata, and every user might have a different version depending on when they last logged in or you updated the 'machine wide' installer 
[03:20:09] <hirogen> any hospital IT here ? 
[03:20:22] <hunterkll> office install including onedrive ..... installs the system wide installer .... which runs on user login to install into appdata

[03:22:34] <hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin, I was recalling our own struggles with updating/maintaining onedrive before we banged out that info 
[03:23:22] <hunterkll> and now that i'm triple recalling it, it may have been teams as well (or especially) - we sorted this out a while ago 
[03:23:39] <xe0n> onedrive should typically handle its own updates, i.e if you're running an older build of onedrive it'll update itself (what it does on a fresh install of windows if you haven't updated the package)
[03:23:59] <hunterkll> xe0n, the one systemwide method does actually do that
[03:24:07] <hunterkll> just runs it outta progfiles instead
[03:24:12] <hunterkll> but stays even in the insider ring if that's your config
[03:24:13] <xe0n> yeah im aware
[03:24:14] <hunterkll> and self-updates

[07:59:25] <xe0n> READ ONLY FRIDAY!!!
[07:59:26] <Work-BWMerlin> Apparently my issue with the airwatch catalogue icon not appearing in Windows is a known issue of it being unreliable
[08:00:28] <xe0n> write your own patch :P
[08:00:36] <xe0n> hack it
[08:04:03] <Bru^> shit
[08:04:24] <Bru^> i was bemoaning my frugal headphones earlier today
[08:04:45] <Bru^> been going through a pressure test and they sound fuggin good
[08:05:08] <Bru^> that or the pricey ones sounds fucking redonk
[08:05:51] <Work-BWMerlin> I wish I knew how to code better
[08:05:59] <Bru^> same
[08:06:03] <Work-BWMerlin> Speakig of which, I am off to a code camp thing this weekend
[08:07:25] <xe0n> so if the icon not appearing, write a script to dump it there?
[08:07:30] <xe0n> or is it like specific to each machine or something?
[08:07:40] <xe0n> this one time at code camp....
[08:08:05] <xe0n> load a script inside airwatch that runs to put the airwatch icon there
[08:08:06] <xe0n> LOL
[08:08:08] <xe0n> iconception
[08:08:32] <Work-BWMerlin> I posted it before but it grabs come kind of serial number as part of the link
[08:08:38] <xe0n> ah
[08:08:40] <xe0n> bummer
[08:08:56] <Work-BWMerlin> This is exactly (no edits) what is in the profile for a webclip https://ds500.airwatchportals.com/Catalog/ViewCatalog/{SecureDeviceUdid}/{DevicePlatform}
[08:09:22] <xe0n> ahh
[08:09:32] <xe0n> ay yo vmware, fix y0 shit
[08:09:34] <Work-BWMerlin> The device platform is easy enough, just hardcode that as Windows
[08:09:40] <xe0n> yep
[08:10:02] <Work-BWMerlin> That Secure Device Udid is a little tricker, if I knew where it came from (hopefully client side) I could make that
[08:10:22] <xe0n> neat
[08:10:22] <Cl0udNinja> can you strace/gdb the process thats running the url?
[08:10:28] <Cl0udNinja> I bet you could find it through that
[08:13:07] <Bru^> lol
[08:13:21] <Bru^> who all uses vmwares full feature stack?
[08:13:36] <Cl0udNinja> probably very few
[08:13:45] <Bru^> %%
[08:13:48] <Bru^> shit
[08:13:49] <Bru^> $$$
[08:13:52] <Bru^> there we go
[08:14:08] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: well, so far i've found that "SecureDeviceUdid" is named such because it's encrypted in some way 
[08:14:09] <Bru^> I mean vmware works well
[08:14:53] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: and the generated device ID is a standard format across all supported platforms, too 
[08:15:09] <Hunterkll> so it's somehow generated by airwatch/workspace upon enrollment
[08:15:38] <Work-BWMerlin> I played around (it was a paint by numbers) with the airwatch API
[08:16:19] <Work-BWMerlin> I guess I could make a scheduled task sequence that ran on each computer to queiry the API, get the SDUDID and make the shortcut
[08:16:55] <Hunterkll> like, iOS since 6+ you can't access the device UDID that it actually has, so it generates one using some factors - potentially just via enrollment 
[08:18:32] <Hunterkll> it seems to have absolutely zero relationship to the actual UDID/GUID/etc that the machine itself may have
[08:19:06] <Work-BWMerlin> So I thought I would try and see what happens if I send the shortcut to another device
[08:19:31] <Work-BWMerlin> That just causes it to install applications on the device the shortcut came from (makes sense)
[08:19:37] <Hunterkll> yikes
[08:19:40] <Hunterkll> that's worse than it not working
[08:19:41] <xe0n> LOL!
[08:19:42] <Work-BWMerlin> So basically you cannot share a generic link
[08:20:25] <Hunterkll> that makes 100% sense
[08:20:36] <Hunterkll> i'd have hoped it wouldn't work at all on a nother device via some kind of authentication....
[08:21:07] <xe0n> Bru^: not in this case it doesn't :P
[08:21:39] <Work-BWMerlin> I don't even know why it is a web url link, it should be built into (still can be a link) the workspace one app that gets installed onto all devices that are enrolled
[08:22:17] <Hunterkll> the workspace one app is what is probably generating the ID to begin with ..... that or hub services is pushing the link via the app... but.... that ID was probably generated somewhere in the enrollment process anyway....
[08:22:54] <Bru^> xe0n: but $$$$
[08:22:57] <xe0n> "known software issue" <Work-BWMerlin posts on airwatch forum> 21 years later, still not fixed...

[08:46:26] <Cl0udNinja> my keys at home begin with 'BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY' and my keys at work are 'BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY'

[08:46:59] <Cl0udNinja> ENDS WITH NO U FIRST

[10:30:09] <DrZak> ah nah, he's using EWS, so i am now thinking how to write the most complicated mail about it and the need to open firewall ports with the final sentence 'It is your responsibility to do it by end of month'
[10:30:30] <DrZak> dont know if he understands what a firewall is 
[10:30:46] <xe0n> yeahh just be professional lol

[10:33:09] <DrZak> ah this is better than coffee
[10:33:25] <xe0n> and if they dont support it, then you'll need to work around it

[10:35:22] <DrZak> tbh. he pissed me off by replying to my - yo, mailbox moving, you need to reconfigure your app - with 'i am not an exchange admin, i dont know what to do' + some more annoyed bshit
[10:35:32] <DrZak> so, let me show you what annoyed really means
[10:36:47] <Oxfff> ^ Being stuck in an endless loop of trying to get the devs to understand that their server-configuration with chef overwritten the acutal serverconfig while they blame you for configuring the server wrongly?
[10:37:02] <Oxfff> I hated those days ...
[10:37:04] <DrZak> :)))
[10:37:20] <DrZak> yea, half of them now change their 15 string passwords bimonthly
[10:37:26] <DrZak> its for security reasons you see
[10:38:00] <Oxfff> i kinda can see where they where going. But this is half-hearted efford (:
[10:38:29] <DrZak> ( not to mention there are tons of mails about this out already, so only a complete lazy fucker wouldnt know )
[10:38:30] <Oxfff> lemme guess: bimonthly you get a message that the new password's not working? (:
[10:38:51] <DrZak> no, just pwd age i set to two months
[10:38:52] <xe0n> the email should've started with "hey we're looking at moving mailboxes to exo, do you know if your software supports exo"
[10:38:53] <csws> DrZak: is the dev imbecile using modern auth?
[10:38:54] <xe0n> and you go from there
[10:39:01] <csws> if not lol
[10:39:04] <DrZak> csws: doubt that :))
[10:39:04] <xe0n> not AY YO WE'RE DOING THIS? OH YOU DONT KNOW THE ANSWER?! F U!!!
[10:39:10] <csws> is he using the .net EWS library?
[10:39:27] <DrZak> java library with pictures
[10:39:30] <csws> oh
[10:39:34] <csws> well
[10:39:36] <csws> hopefully it supports that
[10:39:38] <xe0n> modern auth is fine, app password
[10:39:40] <csws> you gotta make an app registration for it too
[10:39:50] <DrZak> yea
[10:40:14] <DrZak> this customer is the epitome of just in time management
[10:40:29] <DrZak> everything is stretched 20 seconds before the breaking point
[10:40:36] <DrZak> cheapest possible options
[10:40:51] <csws> just send this to him https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-authenticate-an-ews-application-by-using-oauth
[10:40:54] <DrZak> software being upgrade few days before it goes obsolent
[10:40:54] <csws> and pretend he's using .net
[10:40:59] <csws> and if he gets shitty just say idk what a java is
[10:41:01] <csws> lol
[10:42:14] <DrZak> its ridiculous how can they operate this way, they seriously do their planning like - ok, oct. 2022 product X goes obsolete, our vendor told is it takes 5 months to upgrade, so we start in may, coz there's never anything going wrong and the vendors are always keeping the deadlines
[10:42:38] <DrZak> basically the entire company is in the state of permanent stress, coz eveything is hair-breath from exploding
[10:43:17] <xe0n> its simple, if the software doesn't support what you're trying to do, you need to manage it lol
[10:43:18] <DrZak> been doing projects for them for a year, they had already 2 ransomare infections, coz they also get the cheapest and apparently dumbest staff out there :)))))))
[10:43:19] <csws> why is he even using EWS in $CurrentYear?
[10:43:19] <xe0n> welcome to legacy...
[10:43:23] <csws> EWS is deprecated anyway
[10:43:26] <csws> MS graph!
[10:43:38] <DrZak> csws: coz it is right now connected to exchange 2013
[10:43:51] <csws> but cloud!
[10:44:18] <csws> well hopefully when you finally shoehorn this crap into EXO, they'll start working on using graph instead
[10:44:23] <DrZak> hehe
[10:47:56] <A-KO> it would be nice if graph actually fucking worked properly
[10:47:57] <csws> oh my god
[10:48:01] <csws> 90 more minutes of this shit
[10:48:03] <xe0n> A-KO ++
[10:48:04] <A-KO> or that they actually had useful shit in it
[10:48:15] <A-KO> I find myself in the 'wanting' section of GRAPH quite a bit
[10:48:25] <csws> I was going to go shill the MFA stuff in graph beta and they fucking broke it
[10:48:30] <A-KO> yep
[10:48:51] <csws> and it's taking them forever to bring it to a stable release
[10:49:00] <csws> i've been waiting 6 months+
[10:49:06] <A-KO> yeah I dunno what holds them up
[10:49:06] <xe0n> keep waiting :D
[10:49:10] <A-KO> they're being fucking lazy as fuck
[10:49:14] <A-KO> releasing bullshit like
[10:49:15] <A-KO> VR TEAMS
[10:49:19] <A-KO> BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTS FUCKING VR TEAMS
[10:49:23] <A-KO> WITH ALL OF OUR VR HEADSETS
[10:49:31] <csws> provisioning errors too
[10:49:35] <csws> graph just says "Error" and that's it
[10:49:38] <A-KO> I'm salty
[10:49:40] <csws> you have to use MSOL to get the real error
[10:49:47] <csws> and the web UI now finally shows the real error
[10:50:20] <DrZak> yea, digging for errors there is really annoying
[10:50:29] <DrZak> daisy chain of shit
[10:50:32] <csws> oh well I scoped out our EWS trash and it looks like graph does support everything we want to do. that's positive at least
[10:50:38] <csws> oh dude
[10:51:01] <DrZak> bla.blablabla.blaaaaaa.blaaaa.errors.entries.blaaaaaa.blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[10:51:03] <csws> DrZak: unironically I had a really weird bug when assigning licenses to users. it was giving me some generic like 400 error or something
[10:51:07] <csws> could not figure it out
[10:51:42] <csws> turned out it was due to their dependent version of newtonsoft.json having a bug where it was serialising a property twice
[10:51:53] <csws> updated newtonsoft and all good.. wtf
[10:51:58] <DrZak> oh
[10:52:13] <csws> took me a whole day to figure out that one
[10:52:29] <csws> even had some MS dev evangelist hanging around and he was clueless too
[10:53:09] <DrZak> sometimes it appears to me all these cloud abstractions laid one atop of another are gonna make it more complicated to set things up then actually doing it all manually
[10:53:36] <csws> graph SDK is like 99% codegen and honestly it sucks
[11:05:41] <Cl0udNinja> gotta say, MW5 was worth the purchase,  challenging enough to keep me in it

[12:11:43] <fritzwastaken> https://serverfault.com/questions/1003850/what-is-the-difference-between-group-policy-and-registry-policy-processing-in-wi
[12:12:10] <fritzwastaken> most group policy is just local policy that is applied to a group
[12:13:08] <SirSceptalot> AFAIK setting, local policy and group policy all change things in the register, it's just more convenient/user friendly to use settings and policies than to go faffing about in the register
[12:13:27] <fritzwastaken> ^^^
[12:13:33] <SirSceptalot> I only touch registry if there's no way to fix it with policy
[12:14:13] <fritzwastaken> Registry changes are helpful if you are building a server or workstation off a domain
[12:14:34] <fritzwastaken> if they fall into a GPO after joining the domain most can be automaticallty set in a deployment group
[12:15:04] <fritzwastaken> and then moving the machine to the proper OU after having those set

[15:47:27] <AnimalFarmPig> before you talk about cost-- "A production model is a few years away yet, but when it does arrive expect a similar price mark up over standard petrol models as for an automatic diesel variant."

[16:01:10] <AnimalFarmPig> we had the first release in September, which turned out to be the announcement that we would release in October, and then in October we did the "release" which was a powerpoint slide show about the software and an invitation to people to sign up for early access. The early access people have just completed two one hour non-interactive "training" sessions (spread over two weeks). Next week they might actually do 
[16:01:10] <AnimalFarmPig> something interactive.
[16:01:44] <AnimalFarmPig> and, my (soon to be former) boss yesterday announced that, now that we released, we're going to refocus to something totally different

[16:48:49] <thegodsquirrel> Excel is for analyzing data; Access is for storing data
[16:48:49] <estranger> POLYGLOT PERSISTENCE ... use the right tool for each query 
[16:49:06] <estranger> mongo for logs.... not terrible, not the greatest
[16:49:14] <interop_madness> oracle is nice for hierarchical queries with CONNECT BY in PL/SQL
[16:49:15] <estranger> ignoring my fundamental issue with document databases 
[16:49:21] <sd_> 14<K‚Äãillnine> I think Access made storing data more accessible to users 10-15 year ago. But the barrier to entry for a real database is so low now that it really doesn't fit any problem I'd try and solve now
[16:49:24] <AnimalFarmPig> in my case, I'm using sqlite it to store trees that will see frequent appends. So, ex. record 1 has child records 2, 3, and 4, and record 2 has child records, 5, 6, 7, etc. When I want to know the list of ancestors of a given node, I could write a query with a recursive CTE, but instead I `select parent_id` until I reach the root. Because ancestor list is immutable, I can keep a cache in memory, so it's actually `SELECT
[16:49:24] <AnimalFarmPig>  parent_id` until I have a cache hit

[16:51:08] <sd_> 14<K‚Äãillnine> I was looking at dgraph last week
[16:51:22] <AnimalFarmPig> I prefer the ecosystem around SQL
[16:51:45] <sd_> 03<T‚ÄãouchMe> Does anyone know what a technical support for cloud job should entail ?
[16:51:59] <estranger> i prefer using the right tool :)
[16:52:09] <sd_> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> tech support + cloud vendor specific knowledge
[16:52:15] <estranger> dgraph != graphdb either
[16:52:42] <AnimalFarmPig> anyway, point was, low latency of queries on sqlite means it's a lot more feasible to issue a bunch of selects until I have a cache hit. Due to the tree structure, cache hit becomes more likely the closer we get towards the root, and active branches are likely to be in cache
[16:52:52] <AnimalFarmPig> I wouldn't do the same with a traditional rdbms
[16:52:53] <estranger> sqlite is good for tiny datasets
[16:53:07] <sd_> 03<T‚ÄãouchMe> Thank you ! That clears it up a lot more for me now
[16:53:33] <estranger> and if availablity isn't a concern
[16:53:34] <AnimalFarmPig> also, since my table is basically just (id INT, parent_id INT) the records aren't big. I could fit several billion of them in RAM
[16:53:44] <sd_> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> not sure if sarcastic or not but ok
[16:54:11] <csws> sqlite is good
[16:54:11] <sd_> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> But it's really just regular tech support plus maybe a vendor cert or 2
[16:54:30] *** Quits: bloodninja (~bloodninj@user/bloodninja) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[16:54:49] <estranger> yes for tiny datasets where you dont care about availability .. unless they added some clustering/replication I dont know about
[16:54:51] <csws> I migrated an 80k row dataset from a ghetto JSON file that would get loaded into memory and searched
[16:54:56] <csws> and the query times are actually faster with sqlite lol
[16:55:02] <AnimalFarmPig> estranger: there is one you don't know about... one minute...
[16:55:11] <sintax> Does Veeam have a free tier or are they strictly paid?

[16:58:08] <Activ8> with 5 alerts
[16:58:10] <csws> I need a shave
[16:58:13] <estranger> AnimalFarmPig, cool, thats a new one for me
[16:58:23] <csws> why do you schedule your haircuts so far in advance?
[16:58:37] <xe0n> because since covid my barber has opened up internet booking
[16:58:40] <xe0n> sooo i take advantage of it
[16:58:44] <sintax> ah
[16:58:45] <AnimalFarmPig> estranger: it sounds interesting, but, man, running your whole infrastructure on a homebrewed replicated sqlite...
[16:58:46] <JollyRgrs> I was actually pushing it before covid... then covid hit and I never got a chance to go beforehand... so i was behind back then, and now almost 2 yrs later... nothing has touched my hair on my scalp
[16:58:46] <xe0n> and so i know not to schedule work meetings for then :P
[16:58:51] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: nice

[16:59:14] <xe0n> i wanna be able to walk in and boom chair
[16:59:15] <xe0n> done
[16:59:16] <JollyRgrs> that was one good thing about working at my office... there was a decent barber just down the road (near buncha restaurants)
[16:59:17] <xe0n> in and out
[16:59:17] <estranger> AnimalFarmPig, i mean... where i work was a homebrewed project from linkedin hehe stuff has to start somewhere
[16:59:18] <sintax> i just go to a hair cut place and get it cut.
[16:59:23] <sintax> in the summer i razor my hair off
[16:59:27] <xe0n> JollyRgrs: i worked next door to mine at old job :(
[16:59:30] <JollyRgrs> everyone was always like "did you get your hair cut?" after lunch
[16:59:36] <JollyRgrs> i'm like "uh... yeah"
[16:59:38] <xe0n> +++
[16:59:38] <JollyRgrs> nice

[17:00:29] <xe0n> and i hope you comment on her hair when she gets it done
[17:00:38] <xe0n> oh the best part of a haircut is the shower afterwards

[17:13:29] <csws> there's a feature in there where you can rewrite the from headers
[17:13:30] <xe0n> yeah they aren't going anywhere then
[17:13:34] <csws> used it as part of a tenant migration
[17:13:36] <xe0n> just remove 8 lol
[17:13:57] <DrZak> csws: what?
[17:14:11] <DrZak> why would you need to rewrite from?
[17:14:12] <AnonymooseReddtr> They will eventually get down to a single management server
[17:14:16] <csws> DrZak, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/architecture/edge-transport-servers/address-rewriting?view=exchserver-2019
[17:14:19] <xe0n> you'll want two
[17:14:20] <xe0n> lol
[17:14:23] <csws> oh
[17:14:24] <xe0n> and 2 edge
[17:14:24] <csws> soo
[17:14:25] <xe0n> lol
[17:14:40] <xe0n> something something redundancy
[17:14:42] <csws> DrZak, we were demerging a part of the org and they had their own tenant but wanted to keep using our domain while moving over
[17:14:55] <csws> so we setup a connector and shoved all their mail through the edge transports to rewrite it until the cutover happened
[17:14:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> csws yuck
[17:15:02] <DrZak> i mean, i did do it for migration from x to y, during companies split or mergers, just never did that during onprem-cloud migration
[17:15:04] <csws> yeah man it was pretty bad
[17:15:15] <csws> it was cloud-cloud
[17:15:19] <xe0n> tip-tip
[17:15:29] <DrZak> i see
[17:15:39] <xe0n> so i cleaned out my vape today
[17:15:42] <xe0n> works way better now
[17:15:43] <xe0n> LOL
[17:16:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> csws yeah cloud to cloud is fun
[17:16:06] <xe0n> migwiz
[17:16:07] <xe0n> done
[17:16:13] <xe0n> neeeeeeeeexxxxxxttttttt
[17:16:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> I've had more discussions with customers about tenant to tenant in the last 3 months
[17:16:21] <csws> yeah was migwiz for mailboxes
[17:16:24] <sintax> boo i can't get icq.com to load :/
[17:16:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> xe0n yep that would be my go to
[17:16:29] <csws> lol wtf
[17:16:34] <xe0n> s/icq/irc
[17:16:34] <DrZak> so the from rewrite came into effect when they sent an email from their tenant, so it appeared as if they sent it from the domain inside your tenant
[17:16:35] <layer8> sintax meant: "boo i can't get irc.com to load :/"
[17:16:45] <sintax> oh no, i meant icq
[17:16:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> i was testing the exchange online native cross premises move the other day 
[17:16:58] <csws> DrZak, yeah, rewrote john.smith@newcompany.com to john.smith@contoso.com
[17:16:59] <thegodsquirrel> sintax its hosted in Russia
[17:17:04] <DrZak> yea
[17:17:15] <DrZak> AnonymooseReddtr: like account and resource forest and o365?
[17:17:18] <xe0n> fabrikam
[17:17:18] <thegodsquirrel> I noticed it was knocked down by my GeoIP filter
[17:17:24] <csws> it worked alright for 365 but they had an on prem mail server and were just total morons with setting it up
[17:17:39] <csws> they didn't even setup certificates
[17:17:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> DrZak the cross prem migration builds a connector between two EXO orgs and you can migrate mailboxes 
[17:17:50] <csws> wondered why they were having so many issues relaying
[17:17:54] <xe0n> LOL i once saw a setup where instead of loading the cert on the servers, they added it to each client
[17:17:54] <sintax> thegodsquirrel: well that would be why then. i blocked russia at home
[17:17:57] <xe0n> secure?! sure!
[17:18:01] <csws> wtf

[23:38:39] <Activ8> that news just made my night
[23:39:00] <fritzwastaken> I thought you were talking about TaskMaster, which I looooove
[23:39:11] <Activ8> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiHgVDVN6zk
[23:39:16] <Activ8> man I can't wait
[23:40:08] <Activ8> Sir Trevor McDonald to be the games master! sweet
[23:40:42] <Activ8> you talking about this one fritzwastaken - https://www.channel4.com/programmes/taskmaster
[23:40:55] <fritzwastaken> yes
[23:40:57] <fritzwastaken> I love it
[23:41:07] <Activ8> I think I'll watch some now, I love it as well
[23:41:30] <fritzwastaken> I just love watching how different people react to different problems
[23:41:43] <fritzwastaken> its kinda like watching t1 helpdesk guys figure stuff out without asking for help
[23:42:14] <DrZak> huh?
[23:42:21] <DrZak> have you had some fata morgana
[23:42:24] <DrZak> or concussion?
[23:42:27] <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, yeah, it's almost like living next to the ocean :P
[23:42:50] <fritzwastaken> lol wat?
[23:43:09] <shibboleth> "the sound of the ocean"
[23:43:35] <shibboleth> heard in seashells and... emanating for t1 trying to figure shit out
[23:43:37] <fritzwastaken> yea I googled it, weird phenominon
[23:43:57] <shibboleth> fritzwastaken, "heard in the head of dumb ppl"
[23:43:57] <fritzwastaken> excuse the spelling
[23:44:09] <Activ8> a lot of t1 helpdesk are there to do the basics though and the ones who want to learn can learn
[23:44:22] <shibboleth> yeah, sure, some ppl excel and move up
[23:44:25] <Activ8> one place I worked t1 was there to log tickets and change passwords
[23:44:42] <shibboleth> the trick is to find a place where that is rewarded
[23:44:49] <Activ8> yep
[23:45:08] <shibboleth> and not have middle management chain you to t1 because having you there improves their stats
[23:45:30] <Activ8> one thing I hate is a company that force you to work harder just to promote their stats
