[00:10:51] <Anthaas> Hi. I have a server with 4x4TB HDD. I'm installing Ubuntu on it, and am planning to set up a RAID 5 on it. I'm having a little trouble understanding how to set up the initial partitions in the installer, would anyone be able to give me some pointers?

[00:13:03] <genii> If you're planning to install a regular desktop but want to install it onto a raid, I'd suggest using the server install first to get it booting off raid to commandline, then install the ubuntu-desktop package
[00:13:05] <Anthaas> I might be wrong, but given I was going to use mdadm to set up the partitions, I believe where I am is a step or two before that?
[00:14:21] <genii> The method I just described is how I installed a RAID1 plus hot spare setup on my laptop before then installing kubuntu-desktop for the desktop I prefer

[00:48:28] <Anthaas> tomreyn Yeah - a single file system. I will for the most part now use it as an internal services server (nextcloud within my home, etc.) The OS is indeed supposed to be stored upon the available 16TB.

[00:50:21] <Anthaas> The user that created it has permission to read/write, the group that owns the file also has permisison to read and write, and everyone else can read.

[04:19:11] <SuperLag> was thinking like 0,1,2

[06:26:26] <Croran> yeah one server... httpd.conf has your virtual hosts directives...
[06:26:27] <lantech19446> not sure if it's working inside the building or not, i'm trying to avoid going in
[06:26:36] <Croran> hence, apache virtual servers
[06:26:38] <lantech19446> ok is that in /etc/apache2?
[06:26:56] <Croran> probably. depends on your OS/ apache packaging
[06:27:10] <Croran> you could always `locate httpd.conf`
[06:27:55] <lantech19446> nothing comes back to locate
[06:28:08] <Croran> you're running ubuntu?
[06:28:12] <lantech19446> yes

[06:29:56] <sarnold> Croran: lol
[06:30:25] <Croran> hmm. apparently it's in apache2.conf nowadays and httpd.conf is an old name?
[06:30:44] <Croran> and your virtual hosts are now in the 'sites-enabled' directory
[06:31:26] <lantech19446> ok
[06:32:39] <Croran> so check all your virtual hosts. see if any of them function. there could be a separate virtual host for your domain vs one that is by IP address, or maybe one that is local access only at localhost/127.0.0.1

[06:33:59] <lantech19446> the only thing i'm finding in sites-enabled that mentions a virtual host is for port 80 and says the site root is /var/www/site
[06:34:08] <Croran> sarnold: thanks. :)
[06:34:28] <Croran> lantech19446: so it's not associated with any domain name or ip address?
[06:34:55] <lantech19446> *:80 i'm assuming that means to listen on all interfaces
[06:35:02] <Croran> yeah. well for http. not https.
[06:35:30] <Croran> what happens when you try to browse to your page? browser just times out with no error? or is it page not found or a blank page or something?
[06:35:54] <lantech19446> site cannot be reached took to long to respond
[06:36:11] <Croran> and you're going to http://yoursite right? and not https://yoursite?
[06:36:20] <sarnold> sounds like a firewall configured to DROP packets rather than REJECT them

[06:38:06] <lantech19446> it's showing a tcp listener on 80 but no active connections on the IP for the server other than my ssh session
[06:38:36] <Croran> okay and now from your local machine do a 'telnet <ip of server> 80'
[06:39:57] <lantech19446> our site has ssl and functions on http and https
[06:40:06] <lantech19446> i just saw those messages
[06:40:26] <lantech19446> it's trying to telnet but it's not doing anything
[06:40:55] <Croran> that's bizarre you're able to ssh to it, but not telnet to port 80... and apache is listening...
[06:41:31] <lantech19446> i think i may know what happened i gotta try something
[06:41:39] <lantech19446> the firewall comment just triggered something

[18:11:43] <alkisg> Sometimes the real reason that apt complains is a bit lower
[18:11:59] <alkisg> So you need to try installing the mentioned package
[18:12:51] <polve> alkisg: http://ix.io/3tBL
[18:12:58] <alkisg> Also, do you have anything it `apt-mark showhold`?
[18:13:29] <polve> > do you have anything it `apt-mark showhold`?
[18:13:31] <polve> No I don't
[18:14:09] <polve> sadly I am very much inexperienced with ubuntu and apt
[18:14:16] <alkisg> The output of this? apt policy gnome-shell-extension-prefs
[18:14:46] <polve> http://ix.io/3tBM
[18:15:08] <alkisg> You're missing focal-updates/universe from your sources: https://termbin.com/l9ze
[18:15:32] <alkisg> Run `software-properties-gtk` or whatever else ubuntu gnome uses (I'm on mate), and then apt update, and then go on with the installation
[18:16:02] <polve> but I have it uncommented in my sources.list, is that not enough?

[20:40:53] <venividivici1989> hmm maybe ur right, wait i google
[20:41:07] <moha> I installed ntp on ubuntu and run the service. But Cisco switches dose not take time from this NTP server. I searched and found Cisco devices does not support SNTP; How can I check if my ntp server is working in sntp mode or not?
[20:42:04] <hydrian> moha: SNTP != NTP
[20:42:40] <venividivici1989> looks like, if it is nuked, it is not supported
[20:42:52] <venividivici1989> as i read on github ppl say it is not supported anymore
[20:43:42] <hydrian> venividivici1989: Damn, I really wanted that function. Having all of mounts mixed together. To easy to break something unexpectedly.
[20:44:20] <venividivici1989> what do you want exactly?
[20:45:31] <hydrian> Does anybody if there are any cli tools for editing /etc/fstab? Yes I know it is just a textfile but I'd like something that'd have validation.
[20:46:21] <venividivici1989> as far as i know there is no validation tool, just read it twice, heheh
[20:46:32] <venividivici1989> or try a sim in a VM
[20:46:34] <moha> hydrian: when you install ntp on ubuntu (apt install ntp), the command to check the version is: > sntp --version
[20:47:40] <hydrian> I'm just dropping in some bind mounts right now. But I also trying to automate everything since I have enought desktop machines in house that is worth while.
[20:48:21] <TJ-> hydrian: this may help: "mount --all --fake --verbose"
