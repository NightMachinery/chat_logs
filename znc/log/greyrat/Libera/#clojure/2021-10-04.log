[01:45:30] <ToxicFrog> So, I'm developing a clojure program, and also a clojure library it depends on
[01:45:33] <ToxicFrog> AIUI I can develop the library separately and then `lein install` to get it in the m2 cache, and then add it as a normal dependency to the program and lein will fetch it from the cache
[01:45:48] <ToxicFrog> But is there a way to get lein to depend directly on the source so that I don't need to `lein install` every time I make changes to it?
[01:46:04] <technomancy> ToxicFrog: yeah you can symlink it to a `checkouts` dir
[01:46:23] <technomancy> (you would do that in addition to the real project.clj dependency)
[01:46:48] <technomancy> https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#checkout-dependencies
[01:47:58] <ToxicFrog> Thank you!

[10:35:18] <andreyorst> are there any slack irc bridges? Like with matrix
[10:35:32] <Para> weechat has one, based on websockets
[10:35:45] <Para> Although the version I'm using started bugging a while back, might be just an old version though.
[10:42:16] <andreyorst> I meant to make messages from slack appear here, and vise-versa so the channels are bridged
[10:43:07] <Para> Oh those are all terribly horrible systems.
[10:43:38] <Para> The lack of moderation and unmatching 1:n relation between IRC channel and Slack makes it pretty much just noise.
[10:44:05] <Para> I've seen it being done before, and took like 5 minutes for that channel to realize it wasn't a good idea :)
[10:44:45] <Para> (downfall ended up being the person who set up the link got permabanned as turned out he was running some kind of IRC-Matrix-Slack bridge-as-service subscription company)

[15:48:22] <sobel> as a bit of a purist, how bad is the cognitect cargo cult effect over at clojurians slack?
[15:49:23] <Para> Not that terrible, but I'm just being extra wary of that stuff based on eg. what happened to Scala community.
[15:49:51] <sobel> ah i don't know about what happened to Scala community
[15:49:56] <Para> I'd imagine it's something that'll roll over in a few years, but the community has to go through to mature :)
[15:50:43] <sobel> seems like that sort of thing is a natural residue when someone in a wealthy company decides to subsidize a project repeatably
[15:50:44] <Para> Well, a decade ago Scala community treated new people like literal shit. Like you came there with a simple question, the first two answers usually were "You're doing it wrong because you're so used to Java" and "you're not smart enough to understand why this is better"
[15:51:20] <sobel> ugh, that is rot
[15:51:44] <Para> scalaz library was an epitome of this, it implemented a lot of stuff similar to scipy/numpy on Scala but used all Greek method signatures and a custom DSL so that you could have literal math formulas in the middle of the code.
[15:51:48] <leah2> the slack isnt like that at all
[15:51:53] <Para> It took quite a few years for the community to clean themselves.
[15:52:05] <sobel> like every #linux on any shard of efnet/dalnet in the 90s/early 2ks
[15:52:06] <Para> leah2: Scala is the very extreme of this effect, just sharing as a comparison point :)
[15:52:07] *** Quits: xsperry (~xs@user/xsperry) ()
[15:52:10] <leah2> and in #beginners there are lots of questions answered
[15:52:21] <leah2> but i dont see a cognitect cargo cult either... #datomic is pretty useless tho imo
[15:52:43] <Para> But yeah, there's the current not-spoken-out-loud thing of disfavoring Leiningen, for example. Like sure, whatever, but there's no proper replacement, at least not yet. But now there's neil, so maybe soon vOv
[15:53:16] <sobel> on the flip side, clojure community was a good pattern-match to the postgresql community that has been so good to me, else i might not have stuck around to succeed with the language
[15:53:18] <Para> The main reason why I don't care about Datomic at all is because their usage clauses state that you can't publish any benchmarks of it :)
[15:53:30] <sobel> ugh
[15:53:32] <Para> Like sure, keep your secrets Gandalf.
[15:53:40] <sobel> there went the absolute last trace of my interest in datomic
[15:53:48] <leah2> like just about every commercial db ever :p
[15:53:53] <sobel> i like immutable data but just...no
[15:53:53] <goodger> that's to try and conceal the appalling performance that is now an open secret
[15:54:11] <sobel> learn MVCC. bam. that's what you want for immutable data.
[15:54:43] <sobel> (i proselytize but there really is a good story of immutability in MVCC that any FPer should grok to work in the real world)
[15:54:50] <goodger> MVCC?
[15:55:26] <sobel> multi-version concurrency control, the concept postgresql and probably a few other databases use for transaction isolation
[15:55:32] <goodger> ahh
[15:56:02] <sobel> STM for SQL? :)
[15:56:04] <Para> But to be clear, I'm not worried that Clojure core community would go as deep and horrible as others before it, they just need to obviously go through the motions of cargo culting and its downsides. And in a way I also believe that in current state of things Clojure community has a good chance of surviving over this transitionary learning quite easily.
[15:56:24] <sobel> agreed
[15:57:15] <goodger> I just hope some major contributor turns up who doesn't work for a consultancy
[15:57:30] <sobel> i saw scala like i saw kotlin. java is already pretty good, and those make it better but not enough better for me to get into a niche.
[15:57:38] <andreyorst> Para russian scala community is still terrible at answering questions of newcomers :)
[15:58:00] <Para> andreyorst: That sucks.
[15:58:07] <andreyorst> it's basically the same answers as you've mentioned, though a bit worse
[16:00:09] <andreyorst> heh, community welcomeness (if that's a word) is one of the reasons I got into clojure and not Scala/Rust
[16:00:25] <goodger> it is
[16:00:35] <leah2> rust always felt friendly to me
[16:00:38] <leah2> never really did scala
[16:01:16] <Para> Rust community is very enthusiastic/happy about itself, which is nice. Downside is that at least for me I haven't been able to find an entrypoint to the language itself that would start unfolding it to me.
[16:01:46] <leah2> there is rustlings etc
[16:01:52] <Para> That might be because I've never done any C family languages at all, besides some very basics ages ago in school.
[16:02:23] <andreyorst> leah2: rust is friendly, it's everything around rust is unfriendly
[16:04:32] <andreyorst> possibly due to the memes like "rewrite in rust" that everyone got tired even in rust community
[16:05:49] <leah2> hehe
[16:05:54] <leah2> agree
[16:05:54] <yeik-the-spik[m]> <andreyorst> "Para russian scala community..." <- That's unfortunate. I've gone to a few Scala meetups in Spain. They are run by academics/consultants (yes, they are both academics and consultants). They all seem very friendly and ran a lot of introductory talks/tutorials. If only I was able to understand what they were talking about... Between that and Emacs pretty much dropping Scala support I lost all my interest on that.
