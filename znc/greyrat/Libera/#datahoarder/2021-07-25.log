[00:40:46] <ThePendulum> if you're hiring 100 celebrities (including at least 2 porn stars) to sell you to a woman... you're probably shooting yourself in the foot
[00:41:24] <joepie91> ThePendulum: oh that's the rich guys' dating agency thing
[00:41:57] <joepie91> it's like, a company you can hire if you bleed money out your ass
[00:42:04] <joepie91> and they'll build a website for you, place newspaper ads, etc.
[00:42:19] <joepie91> it's all a bit surreal
[00:42:25] <evilgohan2> pathetic.
[00:42:31] <ThePendulum> it's like they're /trying/ to catch a gold digger
[00:42:38] <joepie91> trying to recall what the company is called
[00:42:39] <joepie91> lol yeah
[00:43:19] <joepie91> ThePendulum: https://pierebbingerelationship.nl/
[00:43:21] <joepie91> that's them!
[00:44:18] <joepie91> https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/editienl/artikel/4422051/de-koning-van-de-contactadvertentie-matcht-rijke-singles-dit-een
[00:44:22] <ThePendulum> surreal is indeed the right word
[00:46:23] <ThePendulum> also the fact he didn't just get 1 or 2 celebrities, but /100/, to make sure the message is truly meaningless
[00:47:01] <ThePendulum> "Recommended by Jeff van Goeie Tijde"
[00:47:39] <evilgohan2> pa. the'. tic.
[00:49:09] <ThePendulum> I can hardly comment on dating techniques, but it's certainly curious
[00:49:23] <evilgohan2> I am going to comment on it
[00:50:02] <evilgohan2> If you need to build an entire facade just to go on a date - including getting celeb endorsements, a fake wiki article or website or whatever
[00:50:07] <evilgohan2> Yeah.
[00:50:58] <ThePendulum> don't think we can think of a comment adequate enough to describe it
[00:51:32] <ThePendulum> I'm sure he'll find something, whether it's true love... probably not

[01:51:25] <Allie> evilgohan2: if you have to go through that much faff to get someone to sleep with you for your money, you probably don't have enough money to make someone want to sleep with you
[01:52:12] <joepie91> ThePendulum: I can sorta understand their predicament too, though
[01:53:44] <joepie91> I'm reminded of the thing where celebrities tend to date other celebrities, not for PR reasons, but because it's extremely difficult to have a balanced relationship that actually works with someone who isn't a celebrity
[01:54:53] <ThePendulum> true, similar thing with porn stars dating other porn stars
[01:55:32] <evilgohan2> That makes sense to me.
[01:56:33] <joepie91> I'm not remotely a celebrity, and even I already kinda have these sorts of issues, just because a lot of people recognize me from a lot of relatively high-profile tech things
[01:56:58] <joepie91> and it can be really difficult to tell whether someone is talking to me because they like me as a person, or because I am a name they recognize and look up to
[01:57:14] <joepie91> it kinda sucks?
[01:57:30] <evilgohan2> That's fair, though I cannot relate to it personally. However,  Ican understand the logic.
[01:57:41] <ThePendulum> yeah
[01:58:12] <ThePendulum> I mean I have absolutely no status whatsoever and I already have trouble accepting people are just being genuinely nice to me
[01:58:28] <ThePendulum> can't imagine when you have reason to question their motives
[01:58:36] <joepie91> also related: https://twitter.com/vexwerewolf/status/1419007922647015428
[01:59:44] <ThePendulum> that anxiety peaked a couple years ago at a festival. this woman got on my lap and it wasn't her being close or anything that made me nervous... I genuinely thought it was plausible one of my friends paid her because they felt bad for me
[01:59:47] <evilgohan2> Ah.
[01:59:55] <evilgohan2> The dopamine effect of seeing likes / interactions
[02:00:10] <evilgohan2> I've gone out of my way to try to make sure that I _don't_ succumb to that effect.
[02:00:27] <joepie91> my issue is that I have conflicting interests
[02:00:36] <joepie91> I need reach for activist purposes, but I don't want reach for personal reasons
[02:00:39] <evilgohan2> Especially as it is, by human nature, something that does give us (as humans) pleasure.
[02:00:46] <ThePendulum> joepie91: I guess "being yourself" can be pretty difficult when a lot of who we are /is/ defined by our environment
[02:01:01] <joepie91> environment, expectations, consequences
[02:01:07] <ThePendulum> down to earth might not be closest to who you "really are"
[02:01:39] <joepie91> I am painfully aware that there is a not-insignificant number of people who look up to me as some sort of idol, and that that means there are real consequences to what I say or do
[02:01:44] <evilgohan2> I have to admit, joepie91, that one of my largest frustrations in the current form is that I don't have reach. Me on twitter is just another voice in the void. Sort of "senpai noticing me", I am nothing and mean nothing.
[02:02:01] <evilgohan2> I have no influence (and fucked, if I did, if I'd ever allow myself to called an "influencer")
[02:02:28] <ThePendulum> your largest frustrations is one of my largest comforts
[02:02:33] <joepie91> evilgohan2: I am not convinced that that is a bad thing
[02:02:46] <evilgohan2> I'm not disagreeing on principle, only on effect.
[02:03:16] * joepie91 has been introspecting on some of their life choices lately
[02:03:23] <evilgohan2> It has effectively led us to a point where "the little guy" has no fundamnetally redress but to, for lack of a better term, beg influencers to take notice and spread awareness of their issue.
[02:03:43] <joepie91> right
[02:04:01] <joepie91> I'm not sure that that's that recent a thing though
[02:04:21] <evilgohan2> It is not, but it has been terribly exascerbated by the present dynamic which is what I take issue with.
[02:04:54] <evilgohan2> Let me give you an example. Let's take the company CashApp. Earlier this year, CashApp did some things that were rather problematic. There were reports of this all over Twitter. Meh. Who gives a fuck about @random_person9999112123123 who has 1 like on their post and 10 followers?
[02:05:03] <Myself> it's certainly been interesting that "make a post on hackernews" is the best way to get around the support systems of various megacorps, because interesting technical people at those megacorps tend to read HN 
[02:05:08] <unfinity> ãƒ»ã‚œã‚œãƒ» â€‹ ã€‚ã€‚ãƒ»ã‚œã‚œ\_0<â€‹ FLAP â€‹FLAP!
[02:05:11] <ThePendulum> ,boom
[02:05:13] <evilgohan2> Then person with 50,000 followers has an issue, and suddenly @CashApp is going out of its way to bend over backwards to provide redress
[02:05:15] <Myself> ,bef
[02:05:15] <unfinity> Myself you befriended a duck in 7.548 seconds! You have made friends with 5 ducks in #datahoarder.
[02:05:21] <evilgohan2> That's where I take issue.
[02:05:46] <joepie91> I agree, but it feels like the logical consequence of a hierarchical society
[02:06:02] <evilgohan2> I don't like that. At all.
[02:06:06] <joepie91> same
[02:06:31] <joepie91> the shittest part is that it's not really good for anybody
[02:06:37] <joepie91> not for the people higher up in the hierarchy either
[02:07:03] <joepie91> it just... sucks, for everybody
[02:07:42] <evilgohan2> And to be honest, it's a little - nay, very... what's the word...
[02:07:55] <evilgohan2> depressing
[02:08:17] <evilgohan2> If only for the fact that it reinforces that, well, you don't mean shit.
[02:08:23] <ThePendulum> it seems somewhat inevitable no matter how you structure it
[02:08:52] <joepie91> it's not inevitable, it's just a symptom of a bigger problem
[02:09:39] <ThePendulum> how are you going to factor in the opinion of 5 people when you have a million people to deal with? some things are never going to work for everyone
[02:09:47] <Myself> who said we were trying to create a hierarchial society? I thought we were aiming for the opposite, and we landed here as that went awry. The status quo seems to make a few people a lot of money, but aside from that I don't think it's making anyone happy. So I think it won't last.
[02:10:13] <joepie91> ThePendulum: by not having a million people to deal with
[02:10:54] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: Ironically, it's working the exact opposite way. They're factoring the opinion of ONLY 5 people because they have a ton of followers (read: "influencers") and disregard everyone else because... well... they don't matter.
[02:11:31] <evilgohan2> Here's a hint: we're not in the 5.
[02:11:38] <evilgohan2> (or maybe you are. I don't know)
[02:12:14] <joepie91> Myself: I'm not saying we should create a hierarchical society, I'm saying that's what we currently have
[02:12:17] <ThePendulum> on the assumption that those 5 people are popularizing their viewpoint among a significant portion of their following
[02:12:27] <ThePendulum> not because of the statistic in itself
[02:13:55] <ThePendulum> I think it's going to be difficult to rid a whole society of dynamics that exist on every primary school playground across wildly different cultures
[02:14:16] <joepie91> uh, no, they don't
[02:14:42] <joepie91> these dynamics exist where they are considered culturally acceptable

[02:29:29] <xMopx> what "feature" does a sata port need to support so that i can use a sata to esata cable to connect a hard drive enclosure with multiple drives? 
[02:30:17] <evilgohan2> port replication
[02:30:32] <evilgohan2> warning in advance: it's a pain inthe ass
[02:31:29] <xMopx> is that something that Just Worksâ„¢ or do you need to do some setup?
[02:34:05] <evilgohan2> if the chipset supports it and the driver supports it, under ideal circumstances, it should, but eSATA in general is questionable, and port replication with SATA is a mess.
[02:34:19] <evilgohan2> I suggest checking to ensure that your chipset / drivers support it, and then going from there.
[02:34:40] <evilgohan2> but I would recommend finding another route, i.e.: a NAS, or an HBA and SAS breakouts.
[02:35:01] <evilgohan2> Keep in mind, I'm making this recommendation from personal experience.
[02:35:41] <xMopx> oh i definitely agree
[02:36:20] <xMopx> ive got some drives from my previous nas with 8+ years power on time and an old esata enclosure just sitting around
