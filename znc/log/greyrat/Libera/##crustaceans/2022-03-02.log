[00:07:54] <Brekkjern> Well, it is pretty weird that they side with the Russians. You know, considering history.
[00:08:15] <drakonis> yikes.
[00:08:18] <Brekkjern> But what the hell kind of shitshow is that channel, and why the fuck do you expose yourself to it?
[00:09:06] <gerikson> I left soon after
[00:09:23] <Brekkjern> I see
[00:09:42] <gerikson> I started haning out there during he Freenode fiasco
[00:10:09] <gerikson> but after a while it just got too toxic

[00:11:28] <buttsbot> Twitter - KevinRothrock - Wow. Russia moves to criminalize ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù information about the invasion of Ukraine: On March 4, the State Duma meet ...
[00:49:33] <gwozniak> Happy to see the CEO of my employer send out a message about Ukraine and how employees can help out
[01:01:41] <skyl4rk> nice
[01:03:04] <skyl4rk> there is always the ignorant cynic part of me that whispers that company money going into these kinds of things are for tax reasons
[01:03:56] <skyl4rk> but I guess, helping people struck by war is as good a reason to get some lower taxes as any if not moreso
[01:08:11] <gwozniak> The CEO at my work at least seems to be legitimately interested in better environmental sustainability
[01:08:42] <gwozniak> And has said he has no interest in involving the company in cryptocurrency in any way
[01:09:13] <gwozniak> So while still a capitalist, he does not come across as one of the bad ones
[01:13:15] <skyl4rk> yeah, not trying to downplay the initiative at your work
[01:13:50] <skyl4rk> I say 'ignorant' cynic, because I don't even care to try to find out how such a scheme would work anyway
[01:15:33] <gwozniak> I'm probably not a liberty to say what is in the email, but I will say that he didn't bring down the ban hammer on Russia.  At the same time, doing so probably wouldn't matter (and he outlined why in the message).  I'm okay with the explanation and I don't feel it was profit-oriented
[01:15:51] <gwozniak> As a lifetime cynic of biz folks, I was pleasantly surprised
[01:17:39] <gwozniak> Hrm... seems I need to free up some space on the work machine
[01:17:50] <gwozniak> Good way to kill off the end of the day

[04:05:37] <ngoldbaum> why is he doing this
[04:09:46] <ngoldbaum> i hope this is wrong
[04:10:10] <Church> Hmm?
[04:10:29] <ngoldbaum> oh wait
[04:10:52] <ngoldbaum> i‚Äôm sorry i misread i thought that was about declaring a no-fly zone over ukraine
[04:11:01] <ngoldbaum> which would be way way way worse
[04:11:28] <ngoldbaum> i mean, in a perfect world, we would have tools to do something here that aren‚Äôt beginning world war III

[05:59:14] <hschmale> Honestly I'm really impressed with how well spoken Joe Biden has been so well spoken so far.
[05:59:17] <gwozniak> Tons of hype around it in my feeds, then when people got a copy I heard very little about it
[05:59:52] <gwozniak> That's because it isn't very good
