Well, to make borgmatic a launchd service, yuou have to use Platypus to make a custom Borgmatic app including both borgmatic and borg into the .app container, grant Borgmatic, the app, Full Disk Access, and then, create a
[04:15:44] <Psi-Jack> plist for launchd to actually run it on schedule (or manual execution with launchctl).. Not... Ideal... In the least. LOL

[07:51:06] <Tashtari> Sauvin:  The hardware in question is the I2C slave peripheral on a raspberry pi.  It does support interrupts, but the frustrating part of it is that it throws away the framing inherent to I2C, which is important to what I'm trying to do with it.
[07:51:35] <Tashtari> You can poll its status register constantly to see when a transmission starts and ends, but that's the only way to do it.

[18:25:08] <Guest79> its not a de i agree, but it functions like one.
[18:25:28] <Guest79> basically makes the system run on low resources compared to de
[18:25:39] <djph> maybe because a DE requires a window manager.
[18:25:55] <Psi-Jack> A Window-Manager alone, is not a DE. Never was, never will be, can't be. Quite literally is just not what defines a DE.

[18:26:26] <Guest79> I think i may have made a wrong statement here, id like to take it back
[18:26:32] <jessicara> sometimes wonder where the line is myself between what is a part of the desktop environment and not
[18:26:42] <djph> as opposed to a WM (e.g. i3, awesome, etc) which is _JUST_ something so you can "manage" the windows of your graphical applications.

[18:28:17] <mlu> trying to define what a DE is and isn't is like trying to define when something counts as a home
[18:28:36] <mlu> it may be just a window manager, but if it's usable by itself, I'd consider that a minimalist desktop environment
[18:28:38] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, dwm is a sucky piece of crap by suckless software. The only software that sucks less until YOU patch it to make it actually better. No configuration, just code.

[18:38:48] <Psi-Jack> Yep, 2023 will be 30 years of using Linux for me. 😉
[18:38:53] <mlu> the thing with wxWidgets is that you can switch out the backends easily

But if you have services that receive email, render it to fax, send over SIP to another SIP provider, which then creates a PDF and puts into a recipient's fax2mail inbox... that's still a legit of sending legally binding documents
[19:03:44] <mlu> Psi-Jack: between HP and Brother, I went with Brother due to the availability of much cheaper toner
[19:04:00] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, HP is WAY overpriced for refill stuff.
[19:04:21] <mlu> HP toner is still reasonably priced in the grand scheme of things
[19:04:24] <Psi-Jack> That too is why I would consider Brother in this case. And also Xerox, but Xerox is the epidomy of price.

[19:36:15] <Psi-Jack> It locks up and starts blinking in an error state, until I manually push the power button which causes it to reboot. Sometimes it'll print a page in double-vision, .
[19:36:17] <mlu> akik: both of them are "driverless" profiles
[19:36:51] <MrElendig> for the price, the newer ecotank inkjets are just better in all metrics than laser, excluding the water resistance etc

[20:33:40] <Psi-Jack> The licensing of the ARM CPU on the RPi is literally the cheapest you can get.

[23:12:50] <immibis> is it possible to use two different companies' GPUs at the same time? I'm not expecting any kind of fancy integration or automatic setup - but is it possible for an isolated process to use the "extra" one for offscreen rendering?

[23:52:44] <rty> angkat: ok, serious now. the problem is, ksystemstats shits itself and crashes. that is good, because you found the problem. now, if you want other people to act on it, you will have to collect a backtrace. in order to do so, you need to run the same command inside gdb (or another debugger). for the backtrace to be meaningful, you need debug symbols. usually, the release versions shipped by
[23:52:46] <rty> distributions have them stripped for size considerations. some (good) distributions provide separate packages with debug info. if you don't have such lucky distribution, you will have to compile all the necessary kde plasma libraries that ksysemstats uses manually, with debug symbols. that is out of scope for this conversation
[23:52:47] <notojo> why
[23:53:14] <notojo> I don't like using any display managers
[23:53:16] <ayecee> notojo: when i google "exec startx", the first link returned says to put it in ~/.bash_profile
[23:53:37] <notojo> ayecee, thank you!
[23:53:41] <Kyv> yes
[23:53:53] <rty> exec startx is sometimes more than necessary
[23:54:12] <angkat> rty: no it's ok it's too much for me, i just wanted to see if there was something i had to download, anyway thanks for your help
[23:54:13] <ayecee> there's more than one way to do it
[23:54:20] <notojo> what is it?
[23:54:25] <ayecee> i'm okay not digging too far into it
[23:54:26] <Kyv> that helps to prevent shell access when X is killed
[23:54:50] <notojo> my main purpose is after tty login, my openbox will open automatically
[23:54:57] <ayecee> Kyv: oh, that makes sense
[23:55:01] <rty> for example, if you want your shell startup scripts to run and not race condition the gui environment. so, first you login, and then you start the graphical server manually. obviously by that time all the scripts have finished
[23:55:22] <Kyv> notojo: I use one which is conditional on the tty
[23:55:32] <[[R]]> rty: i think the term 'race condition' is frowned upon
[23:55:34] <Kyv> are you looking for something like that?
[23:55:35] <rty> and why would you want that. for example, to unify what happens when you login physically and wheen you ssh into your pc
[23:55:39] <notojo> which what, Kyv?
[23:55:58] <aaro> i guess typing 'startx' is too much work
[23:56:09] <ayecee> well yeah
[23:56:11] <notojo> yes
[23:56:17] <ayecee> we have computers to do things programmatically
[23:56:27] <notojo> that's true
[23:56:31] <kuhilas> yeh seems like I have exec startx in ~/.bash_profile too
[23:56:32] <rascul> programming is too much work
[23:56:48] <rty> angkat: yeah, then just wait. somebody will definitely (copium) fix it. de-fi-ni-te-ly
