[02:37:04] <jcowan> I've been trying to lay the groundwork for a PL/I-to-C compiler in my *copious* spare time
[02:38:58] <jcowan> The first thing is to document PL/I Subset G in a usable way.  I'm starting with the Stratus VOS language reference and correcting it against the standard, which is basically a compiler and interpreter written in technical English.
[02:39:53] <jcowan> at the same time working out how to map Subset G to GNU99 (or possibly GNU11); using Gnu extensions will be much simpler.
[02:40:45] <jcowan> I think all the required libs in C already exist except foor pictures/formats, which are analogous to printf.
[02:41:34] <jcowan> Right now I'm thinking about how to do Unicode; the natural approach is UTF-32 and I may have to go with that

[14:46:03] <amazigh> I am starting to wonder what tricks xapian is pulling..
[14:46:43] <amazigh> the index size is trivial, the indexing time is ridiculously small.
[14:50:40] <amazigh> the index is half the size of the corpus.
[14:58:38] <amazigh> no it is not half the size, I need precisly check that.
[15:07:45] <amazigh> what is clear is that xapian takes 5 seconds, when my code use 160 seconds
[15:08:31] <amazigh> I checked the index size, with the small datatset, it is bigger than the corpus, and my code produce an index that 1.5 times bigger than xapian

[21:54:48] <gwatt> Is datum->syntax well-defined if the template argument doesn't come from a syntax-case pattern?

[21:59:33] <sham1> I'd assume that something like (datum->syntax (syntax foo) '(bar baz)) should work but it wouldn't have any real context aside from what the syntax form there gives it. But yeah, the spec is somewhat ambiguous about how that should work
[22:00:20] <gwatt> That's what I assumed too, and it works the way I want in chez and loko, but guile and racket's r6rs mode complain
[22:00:50] <amazigh> what does unsyntax says?

[22:17:21] <gwatt> ultimately, what I want is to generate a procedure and a syntactic façade over the procedure. This works fine, however I also want the procedure and macro to share the same name so that errors get reported in a sensible manner.
[22:19:29] <gwatt> I've got something like (with-syntax ([proc-name (datum->syntax #'new-scope (syntax->datum #'name))]) ...), but that doesn't work the same in every scheme

[22:21:22] <amazigh> gwatt: is that a good example of what you are trying to do: http://ix.io/3IGR
[22:22:42] <amazigh> what you try to do is replace a macro with a proceudre with the same name?
[22:23:06] <amazigh> maybe it will mess up the phases?
[22:23:12] * amazigh trying to be helpful.
[22:23:42] <amazigh> btw the above ix.io link work as expected with unsyntax on top of chibi
[22:24:52] <gwatt> I don't quite think that's what I've got. I'm re-scoping an identifier passedin into the macro so that I can have two bindings that look like they share the same name
[22:26:56] <amazigh> isn't the name bound to a macro only available at compile time?

[22:32:31] <amazigh> that is a 404

[22:32:47] <amazigh> I let other chime in
[22:32:50] <amazigh> bbl
[22:33:18] <gwatt> Line 104 is what needs to change to make it work on all schemes. comment out existing (datum->syntax ...) and uncomment out (id-suffix ...)
