[03:05:33] <TimMc> I wonder why "an American" or "a German" sounds fine to me, but "a Chinese" sounds weird.
[03:06:46] <twb> TimMc: also "a Japanese" sounds very racist to me
[03:06:47] <Me-me> Because "Chinese" is uncountable.
[03:07:08] <twb> I was watching Tintin last week and the whole thing seemed super racist
[03:07:14] <Me-me> I believe the correct term, albeit not politically, was Chinaman.
[03:08:12] <twb> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chinese#Usage_notes  <--- discussed here
[03:08:57] <twb> The "However" there seems confusing because their Chinese language example glosses to "Chinese person" not "Chinese"
[03:09:26] <Me-me> Yeah, they're not considering the comparison to other nationalities, as we are.
[03:09:41] <twb> Me-me: except Japanese, as I did :-)
[03:09:59] <twb> "人" is man (in the sense of "person", like in "mankind")
[03:11:49] <Me-me> I'm okay with a lot of loan words in english but I draw the line at kanji, katakana and the like. Romanise it and I might use it.
[03:12:00] <twb> Beijing Chinese language is analytical.  How do demonyms translate in other analytical languages?
[03:12:17] <twb> Me-me: e.g. "zongguoren" and "renminbi" ?
[03:12:51] <Me-me> Right. Or, *ehem* senpai, kawaii, etc.
[03:13:27] <Me-me> Is Beijing Chinese "traditional" or "simplified"? I'm more familiar with those terms instead.
[03:19:40] <LjL> Me-me, it's "simplified", but that's about the writing
[03:19:48] <LjL> it has nothing to do with it being Mandarin
[03:19:51] <LjL> if that was in question
[03:20:04] <Me-me> I wasn't intending it to be, but that's good to know.
[03:20:26] <twb> Me-me: Beijing Chinese (Mandarin) uses simplified script normally.
[03:20:49] <twb> Me-me: simplified/traditional is a communist/nationalist split
[03:21:09] <Me-me> I wasn't aware it was politically enforced. I figured it was simply a cultural shift.
[03:21:38] <twb> Me-me: simplified chinese (the script) was invented by the CPC because they wanted poor people to be able to read
[03:21:53] <LjL> it is a government-mandated list of "kanji", to use the term you used ("hanzi" in Chinese, i believe), and of radicals, that have been modified
[03:22:14] <LjL> it used in all of mainland China; it is not used in Taiwan, and in Chinese communities abroad, it depends
[03:22:17] <twb> Me-me: the fascists, who escaped for Formosa and ran the place until about 2007, don't care about poor people so don't mind if Chinese writing is hard to learn
[03:22:32] <twb> s/for/to/
[03:22:32] <chat> twb meant to say: Me-me: the fascists, who escaped to Formosa and ran the place until about 2007, don't care about poor people so don't mind if Chinese writing is hard to learn
[03:22:39] <LjL> it's also not used in Hong Kong at present i believe
[03:22:56] <LjL> oh lawd.
[03:23:20] <Me-me> I vote to end this discussion with a white peace.
[03:23:51] <twb> Me-me: "Chinese" is about 12 different languages from a single family.  Beijing "dialect", i.e. Mandarin, is the national standard in China (PRC).  Canton "dialect" (Cantonese/Yue) is the most common language in Chinese disapora.
[03:24:03] <Me-me> .d white peace
[03:24:04] <tinsoldier> white peace — Noun: 1. A peace agreement after a war, in which the parties do not impose onerous terms on one other. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/white_peace
[03:24:30] <twb> They are about as similar as (say) Italian and French.
[03:24:32] <Me-me> I'll admit, I learned the term from Stellaris and other civilisation builder games.

[04:22:32] <TimMc> but then I realized that it's the *exact* same construction as "an American" -- the adjective form being used as a noun!

[04:27:01] <TimMc> "An Italian" sounds a *little* weird to me. Hmm.
[04:28:09] <TimMc> I don't think it's just that -an endings for demonyms are more common, because a Dane and a Finn sound fine, while a French doesn't.

[17:47:16] <cAMP> What do you think the expression "I only see murk" expressess? (context 5th paragraph https://csmr.kapsi.fi/blog/posts/20220131-soviet-finland.html)
[17:52:04] <pussipupu> "it's all Greek to me" is the equivalent of the Hebrew thing in English incidentally

[17:59:27] <pussipupu> That string doesn't occur in the fifth paragraph, but it seems you're unable to see a clear path forwards
[18:01:09] <bullgard4> cAMP, I would interpret the phrase "I only see murk" to be equivalent to "I can only detect rubbish." 
[18:05:53] <cAMP> pussipupu: I suppose your point about my idiom being a kind of finglishism is a good one.
[18:06:07] <cAMP> (the all hebrew to me one)
[18:06:44] <cAMP> pussipupu bullgard4 so with your comments it seems perhaps that PKD quote can stay.
[18:07:30] <cAMP> - At least once I correct it as PKD originally seems to have written it: "I see only murk."
[18:08:20] <cAMP> Thanks for your input, pussipupu & bullgard4 !
[18:12:00] <pussipupu> It's a common type of idiom, but the language used in it varies
[18:12:29] <pussipupu> I recently saw a post with a graph of them but don't have it to hand
[18:16:26] <cAMP> Ah yes, all the chinese/japanese/mumbo jumbo/garbage -variations, used across different languages?

[20:36:39] <DevAntoine> Hello
[20:37:39] <DevAntoine> Let's say that, when a plomber goes to a client house he got some money for the travel but it's a fixed cost. Whenever he drives 10km or 50 he got the same amount of money.
[20:37:44] <DevAntoine> It's a like a travel package cost.
[20:37:49] <DevAntoine> How'd you call that?
[20:38:31] <urbec> wannabe

[20:39:46] <TimMc> DevAntoine: Hmm... you might say that the plumber charges a fixed fee for travel. Maybe "flat rate" but I usually hear that for shipping packages.
[20:40:13] <TimMc> DevAntoine: Probably I would just refer to it as a fee.
[20:40:41] <DevAntoine> TravelFee then?

[20:42:46] <TimMc> Travel *can* refer to vacations, but only in some contexts.
[20:43:15] <TimMc> It might be called a travel fee or a visit fee or something.
[20:43:45] <DevAntoine> And what if I need to have a dedicated invoice for this.
[20:43:54] <DevAntoine> Would I call it travel fee invoice?
[20:44:00] <DevAntoine> Would it make sense?
[20:44:36] <TimMc> I suppose, although wouldn't you usually invoice the travel fee, labor, and parts all together?
[20:47:42] <DevAntoine> TimMc: oh don't ask me that :D
[20:47:59] <TimMc> haha
[20:48:19] <TimMc> I think you'd just refer to as an invoice, whatever it's for.
[20:51:23] <DevAntoine> hum, my coworkers like "travel reimbursement"
[20:53:18] <TimMc> I would usually hear that for something like... an employee of a company has to travel to a conference, and gets a travel reimbursement from their employer.
[20:53:49] <TimMc> And that reimbursement would be pro rata, based on miles traveled -- or based on price of plane tickets, etc.

[21:38:32] <TimMc> Here: If a problem *is* deceptively hard, that means it *looks* deceptively easy.
[21:39:10] <TimMc> So "deceptively hard" and "deceptively easy" both describe the same thing here, but using different verbs.

[23:11:42] <blkshp> Be less lazy. This is the channel commander speaking! :P
[23:12:05] <Klinda> I am used to spam write things in more rows, I will never learn to write as you
[23:12:30] <AmalLight> blkshp are you the owner of this channel ?
[23:12:32] <blkshp> That's because you don't care to because you can't be bothered :P

[23:14:01] <TimMc> wodes: s/$/./
[23:14:01] <chat> TimMc thinks wodes meant to say: Same with (parenthesis), same with "quotes", etc.

[23:14:43] <wodes> Another language :D
[23:14:52] <wodes> And a terrible one

[23:19:41] <AmalLight> wodes can you explain me Oua meaning, please?
[23:20:35] <wodes> AmalLight I made a typo, I wanted to write "oui", yes in french.
[23:21:05] <AmalLight> wodes oh thank you, very kind to response.
[23:21:05] <Klinda> I am also not good in my native langauge, imagine in English. Instead of fixing some phrases, maybe you should advise some free stuff to learn English :D
[23:22:32] <LuisR14> :T
[23:22:37] <AmalLight> Klinda how is going in your life? maybe do you remember me, i am Kaumi!
[23:22:57] <wodes> Klinda just like learning any other language: by practicing it. Watching movies, series, listening to some music, talking to people on IRC, or Discord, vocal communities (easier on Discord)

[23:41:07] <AmalLight> have I shocked you? I thought you are more older sorry :)
[23:42:04] <blkshp> IYou can't be "more older" 
[23:42:12] <blkshp> You can only be "older" or "more old" 
[23:42:13] <blkshp> RULE:
[23:42:25] <blkshp> Don't use "more" when the next word ends "er"
[23:42:31] <AmalLight> *Did I shock
[23:42:44] <AmalLight> blkshp yes right
[23:43:30] <AmalLight> but is correct to use "have I shocked you?" I think no!
[23:43:45] <blkshp> "Have I shocked you?" is perfect.
[23:43:59] <AmalLight> what do you think? i don't know why my mind suggest me to use have I
[23:44:05] <AmalLight> mm
[23:44:34] <AmalLight> blkshp I am learning English and German on babbel
[23:44:42] <AmalLight> so i am not perfect
[23:45:23] <AmalLight> blkshp and about "speaking sessions" is it correct for you?
[23:46:49] <blkshp> "[20:15:23] <AmalLight> blkshp and about "speaking sessions" is it correct for you?" that entire thing means nothing to me.
[23:46:53] <blkshp> I don't know how to answer.
[23:47:22] <AmalLight> Sometimes i think i have to write only when i am absolute convinced about that
[23:47:46] <AmalLight> blkshp ok perfect
[23:48:38] <AmalLight> blkshp +ing can make a lot of confusion in general
