[01:02:47] <Khaytsus> Google Cloud's free for a year, although not sure if that includes the IP as being free..  but is like $2.70/mo with a public IP.
[01:05:21] <Khaytsus> Annoys me they charge for a public IP, but I suspect they had _tons_ of machines with public IPs people had requested that didn't use them.. it reduced the usage and increased profits

[06:39:42] <mattf> Is it possible to not part all clients when one of them send the part command?
[06:39:57] <mattf> or at least ignore /part
[06:40:11] <Khaytsus> stickychan can work around dumb clients that do parts when you don't tell it to
[06:40:27] <Khaytsus> A few clients part on exiting, I've heard of some that part if you close the window, etc
[06:40:41] <mattf> well only all clients have parted it should part
[06:40:41] <mattf> is there a way
[06:40:58] <Khaytsus> I already said?
[06:42:46] <mattf> oh thanks
[06:55:48] <mattf> Khaytsus: well didnt work for ERC
[06:56:00] <mattf> Do i need to really restart znc/
[06:56:01] <mattf> ?
[07:05:44] <Khaytsus> To load stickychan?  no?  Not sure why you'd restart znc.  Just load stickychan on the network(s) you want, set channels sticky.  
[07:05:53] <Khaytsus> I'm offhand not any other way to do precisely what you were asking.
[07:06:05] <mattf> yeah ERC seems to be screwed up
[07:06:20] <mattf> well it is sending part 
[07:08:39] <mattf> it doesn't work at all, for any of the irc clients I have it leaves on the others when i close the channel
[07:08:57] <mattf> All i had to do was to enable stickychan?}
[07:09:11] <mattf> aaah
[07:09:13] <mattf> set the channels
[07:14:06] <mattf> ok i enabled a channel and it still parts
[07:14:11] <mattf> the channel*
[07:16:47] <Khaytsus> no..  
[07:17:42] <mattf> I mean my clients are parting
[07:18:11] <Khaytsus> znc can't stop a client from parting a channel...  but znc itself will _not_
[07:18:32] <mattf> do i need autoattach then?

[15:16:54] <Kays> vysn, personal preference. Different people prefer different setups. With ZNC, you setup ZNC and that's it. You don't need weechat, ssh (except to install znc), tmux, or any of that stuff. Then you can pick your favorite IRC client on whatever device you use and have it connect to ZNC. From there, you setup all your servers and channels within ZNC. And that's it.
[15:18:06] <Kays> with ssh+tmux+weechat, you would pick this option if you really want to use weechat as your main client or you want to do other stuff on the server like development or whatever else.
[15:20:53] <Kays> ZNC is more flexible if you want (or need) to use many different devices, each with their own IRC client. weechat option is less flexible but you only have to worry about using and configuring one client.
[15:22:25] <knolle> not really, weechat has its own relay clients and you can even connect other irc clients to it
[15:22:53] <Kays> knolle, yes but less flexible. There is weechat-android which is awesome; however iOS is a bit more finnicky.
[15:51:44] <vysn> Thank you
