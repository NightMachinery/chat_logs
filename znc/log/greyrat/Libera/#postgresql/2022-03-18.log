[03:59:55] <StuckMojo> you can start with a full backup, then apply transaction log segments to wind it forward until you get to the point in time that you want
[04:00:10] <StuckMojo> you can't scroll backwards and forwards though, just one direction
[04:00:26] <StuckMojo> and you need all the intervening log segments, which is where the archiving comes in
[04:01:20] <StuckMojo> you can't "go back", but you can start with an old backup from before the place you want to be, restore that, then play it forward and stop where you want
[04:01:32] <work> What you mean by "you can't scroll backwards and forwards though, just one direction" ?
[04:01:51] <StuckMojo> exactly what i said
[04:01:59] <work> ahh Okay, not bad
[04:02:29] <StuckMojo> this requires you to have a backup from earlier though
[04:02:46] <StuckMojo> and all the wal (aka transaction log) segments that were generated since then
[04:02:51] <StuckMojo> see the doc link

[04:22:59] <StuckMojo> work: right, so you can use that TEMPLATE feature to take quick snapshots of your db every so often
[04:23:18] <StuckMojo> stick a timestamp at the end or _bak1 _bak2 that kind of thing
[04:23:50] <StuckMojo> it's very handy, especially if you're using some kind of migrations to build your initial db that takes a while
[04:24:19] <StuckMojo> you build it once, then use that as a template and make a copy, so you can always start from there instead of having to run the migrations every time
[04:27:59] <work> StuckMojo: Thanks, really appreciate

[05:14:31] <TheyCallMePaul> I'm working on getting an actual backup system in place for my servers and seem to be leaning toward Bacula (though I don't use tape). They have this article on backing up PostgreSQL:
[05:14:39] <TheyCallMePaul> https://www.bacula.org/postgresql-backup-software/
[05:14:52] <TheyCallMePaul> Then, after some searching, I discovered Barman and have read through ~1/3 their manual page:
[05:15:00] <TheyCallMePaul> https://docs.pgbarman.org/release/2.12/
[05:15:19] <TheyCallMePaul> I just want to do a basic sanity check to see if I'm down the right path at least. This is the first time I've needed something more than just an SQL dump.

[14:12:23] <eric> I have to dump and restore a 93GB database
[14:13:20] <eric> it is too long, the biggest table is not restore after one day !
[14:14:00] <eric> i have some specials index for chemistry search and computation
[14:14:22] <eric> maybe i should not backup the indexes, only schema and data ?

[14:15:26] <eric> i is possible to dump only schema and data without indexe, because i guess the restore check contraints and indexes...
[14:15:37] <eric> arf..
[14:15:44] <eric> ok ne2k
[14:16:35] <eric> curiously i had warning when testing a restore :

[14:17:18] <eric> this message is clearly sent because of the chemistry cartbrige, so i suppose a check is done
[14:17:33] <eric> maybe i should install the chemistry cartbridge aterwards

[17:55:10] <axsuul> Hi, I'm having a constant issue with Postgres 11.5 suddenly not responding anymore to queries (it's still up and running) and it just happened again. Looking at my metrics, the server it's on saw a spike of high load right before it stopped responding.  I run a VACUUM ANALYZE nightly on all my tables. Looking at the logs, it appears that Postgres stopped responding around the same time a VACUUM ANALYZE was being done on a large table. Could that be a
[17:55:11] <axsuul>  culprit?

[17:58:57] <Myon> I'm not aware of this one, but debugging old versions just to find the problem has been fixed two years ago is no fun
[17:59:15] <axsuul> Gotcha, would you recommend I update to 14.2?
[17:59:41] <Myon> that's a major upgrade that needs migrating the data
[17:59:49] <Myon> just go to 11.15, that's painless

[18:36:32] <ne2k> well hello again
[18:36:57] <eric> I wonder if i can copy the postregsql data folder to one server to another, as if i move the postgres data folder
[18:37:38] <ne2k> eric, I believe this is not recommended unless you can guarantee that all package versions are the same
[18:37:43] <eric> because i am using pg_dump and pg_restore, but the two biggest table are not restore ! They are empty, all others table seems to be ok
[18:37:59] <eric> non package version is not the same...
[18:38:03] <eric> thanks ne2k
[18:38:09] <eric> *no
[18:38:13] <ne2k> eric, did you check the data was actually in the dump? i.e. was the problem in the export or the import
[18:38:29] <ne2k> what format of dump is it?
[18:38:39] <mst> pg_dump and pg_restore is the safest approach and until you know what went wrong you really shouldn't try anything less safe
[18:38:52] <eric> i think this is a custm format, is use pg_dump -FC ...
[18:39:05] <eric> *custom
[18:39:20] <mst> what operating systems and what versions of postgres?
[18:39:27] <ne2k> eric, I'm not an expert, but someone was asking a similar question the other day, about moving the data directory between distros that have different libcs, and they were told it was A Bad Idea
[18:39:42] <eric> ok, i won't do it
