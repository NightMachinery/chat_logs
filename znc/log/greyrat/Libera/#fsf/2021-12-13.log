[03:10:09] <KE0VVT> M6piz7wk[m]: Whatever nckx might or might not have done, this is not the right way to address it.
[03:11:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> KE0VVT: i had 8 hours worth of chat with him about it, he's unwilling to  not be abusive 
[03:11:42] <KE0VVT> (I have no clue what is going on at all, I just know this is no way to talk.)
[03:12:33] <KE0VVT> nckx: It's translated as 'gossip', but it's more than that.
[03:12:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> KE0VVT: thing going on is nckx banning me from guix for reasons he himself don't understand and telling me that he will unban me if he can dictate who can i talk to on IRC/Matrix
[03:13:26] <nckx> KE0VVT: ☝ This is what was going on, for about 2 weeks, in #guix.  Multiple people reported PM harassment on top of that, and enough was enough.
[03:13:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> "Allegedly" reported 
[03:13:48] <nckx> No.
[03:13:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> from what he said the reports are made up
[03:14:56] <KE0VVT> nckx: I can't type emoji in my terminal.

[03:15:43] <KE0VVT> This does not help.
[03:15:52] <nckx> Imagine sitting through 8 hours of that trying to work out a solution.
[03:16:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> i proposed a sensible solution that you ignored

[03:16:35] <anton> hello free software foundation
[03:16:37] <KE0VVT> Color emoji work on GNU/Linux. I wonder if Emacs removed the color emoji ban from MacOS.
[03:17:17] <nckx> Your solution was (1) the FSDG doesn't apply to you (2) you get to PM whoever you like after they ask you to stop.  That's not a solution, it's the behaviour that got you banned in the first place.
[03:17:42] <nckx> We've been over this, so I don't think you're interested in changing.
[03:17:56] <nckx> I hope you find another distro that is willing to deal with you.
[03:18:25] <M6piz7wk[m]> from my talk with GNU my actions do not violate FSDG and you implementation of them is to be hostile to new people who struggle installing Guix.. wtf
[03:18:26] <KE0VVT> So, he propagated personal channels that do not comply with the FSDG, in #guix?
[03:18:54] <nckx> Not a personal one, but repeatedly, yeah.
[03:18:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> i even maintain an unofficial wiki to enforce FSDG that is designed to provide turorials how to replace proprietary hardware for libre on systems
[03:19:10] <nckx> Lots of people do so by accident, it's no big deal.
[03:19:22] * GNUHacker back
[03:19:24] <GNUHacker> sup
[03:19:31] <KE0VVT> M6piz7wk[m]: If you need proprietary stuff, there are people in the community who can tell you where that is.
[03:19:51] <KE0VVT> M6piz7wk[m]: But this is a sacred space.
[03:19:58] <nckx> But they stop after being explained why it's not appropriate, they don't claim that they know the secret real FSDG and it's fine to promote non-free repos.
[03:20:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> KE0VVT: There is channel called nonguix which is "unofficial" but maintained by guix developers it has firmware needed for lot of people to be able to even install guix.. i tried to help people that i got to try guix and then found them a replacement hardware for the proprietary that they can liberate their devices with
[03:20:44] <nckx> At least this is the right place to discuss misinterpretations of the FSDG, unlike #guix.
[03:20:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> he says that FSDG doesn't apply to me 
[03:21:04] <nckx> No, I said it does.
[03:21:09] <M6piz7wk[m]> but still randomly PMs people and tells them to use nonguix who struggle in guix with issue that is related to firmware
[03:21:39] <KE0VVT> nckx: What is the line?
[03:21:51] <nckx> KE0VVT: WDYM?
[03:22:00] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], Don't use nonguix.
[03:22:05] <Noisytoot> It packages proprietary malware.
[03:22:11] <GNUHacker>   <-- test emoji
[03:22:38] <KE0VVT> nckx: I don't use nonguix, but if that's someone else's cup of coffee... (I don't drink coffee.)
[03:22:42] <nckx> Ironically, I only see F269.  All other emojis tend to work.  Is it a real (and non-bleeding-edge) one?
[03:22:45] <M6piz7wk[m]> i don't use nonguix i maintain wiki that is designed to enable people to liberate their device and helped two people already to replace modem in their notebook to use guix without nonguix
[03:22:58] <KE0VVT> GNUHacker: F269
[03:23:06] <Noisytoot> I also only see F269
[03:23:07] <nckx> KE0VVT: I also don't, so I can't really help you, I think.  I don't understand the question though.

[03:23:38] <Noisytoot> No they aren't
[03:23:41] <Noisytoot> Check the ban list
[03:23:47] <Noisytoot> litharge removed the ban a while ago
[03:23:54] <KE0VVT> nckx: I mean, do you want to take nonguix offline?  I think it has its place, and those people should not be disturbed.

[03:24:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> -.-

[03:24:40] <Noisytoot> So you're AKICKed
[03:25:03] <Noisytoot> nckx, litharge shouldn't remove bans set by AKICKs without also removing the AKICKs
[03:25:07] <nckx> KE0VVT: What's the line between separate projects?  There's no rule against nonguix building on Guix.

The main problem that they highlight is that most closed source companies are not contributing back with finances or code to the projects that they use. But I'm thinking if those projects were using the GPL license those corporations would have to make their source available to users. Wouldn't this be a way of making them give back?

[03:30:30] <KE0VVT> junebug: GPL does increase contributions, but a lot of companies are starting to pull an Apple and purge the GPL for that reason.
[03:30:47] <KE0VVT> junebug: LLVM was funded by Apple, just to get rid of the GPL.
[03:30:56] <junebug> KE0VVT, but if all software was GPL then they wouldn't have a choice right?
[03:31:07] <nckx> M6piz7wk[m]: Has this projection ever actually worked on anyone?  I find it hard to believe.  It's mainly funny.
[03:31:09] <junebug> Or most of the important ones at least

[03:31:58] <junebug> KE0VVT, I feel like we have the upper hand since we're the one's writing the code they will use. We can use this to make a statement
[03:32:28] <junebug> I'm probably preaching to the crowd here
[03:32:28] <KE0VVT> junebug: Right, but you see how Apple pays people to replace copylefted code with permissive code.
[03:32:33] <junebug> to the choir*
[03:33:05] <junebug> KE0VVT, you mean they are rewriting whole libraries?
[03:33:30] <nckx> KE0VVT: What's sad is… I bought into the act in the beginning, and believed some of it (before verifying their story), and now I feel naive, but lesson learnt.
[03:33:33] <KE0VVT> junebug: Clang was my example.  A lot of other examples, like Chromium.
[03:33:50] <nckx> ‘Trust, but verify’, as we say at the office.
[03:34:32] <junebug> KE0VVT, I guess they have the money to do that kind of thing. But they can't rewrite everything
[03:34:48] <KE0VVT> junebug: They also replaced Bash with ZSH.
[03:35:06] <junebug> KE0VVT, zsh in under what license?
[03:35:23] <KE0VVT> junebug: For the longest time, they kept Emacs at an ancient version, to avoid the GPLv3.
[03:35:35] <KE0VVT> junebug: ZSH is permissive.
[03:36:03] <junebug> KE0VVT, oh wow. What could they want with zsh source code? What are they building? Their own shell?
[03:36:08] <nckx> Apple ships Emacs!?
[03:36:21] <nckx> This sure is the channel for TILs I'm not sure I wanted to L.
[03:36:29] <KE0VVT> nckx: They shipped Emacs until it became GPLv3, and they shipped old GPLv2 versions for as long as they could.
[03:36:33] <nckx> Huh.
[03:36:44] <dehml> KE0VVT: what is the difference between permissive and copyleft programs ?
[03:36:56] <nckx> I knew Emacs ran on Macintoshes (e.g., the whole colour emoji debacle) but not that it was at one point shipped with them.
[03:37:01] <KE0VVT> junebug: They want ZSH so they can ship it with MacOS without having to distribute source code.
[03:37:58] <KE0VVT> junebug: Permissive is like the X11 license, where you do not have to redistribute source code.
[03:38:02] <junebug> KE0VVT, forgive my ignorance. If I build an OS that comes with software under GPL I have to copyleft my OS?
[03:38:42] <KE0VVT> junebug: I don't know. With GPLv2, they were able to ship Emacs just fine.  I don't know what their beef with GPLv3 was.
[03:39:33] <KE0VVT> nckx: Yes.  I loved how Emacs shipped with MacOS.  Too bad my school prohibited shell access because it was "for crackers."
[03:40:02] <junebug> KE0VVT, I guess your school didn't like white people
[03:40:37] <KE0VVT> junebug: Heh. No, security crackers.

[03:41:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> <KE0VVT> "nckx: Yeah, advertising nonguix..." <- FWIW i am aware of saying nonguix twice in #guix before i was told that they are trying to comply with FSDG and then i didn't mention it.
[03:41:34] <nckx> KE0VVT: A specific kind of hilarious mind you.  The sad kind.
[03:42:05] <junebug> KE0VVT, these days kids bring their own laptops to school so more opportunities for fun!
[03:42:05] <KE0VVT> nckx: I tried to explain that shells in themselves are not a security risk, that you can lock it down just as much as a desktop, if not more.  They did not listen.

[03:54:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> happy that FSFE seems to care significantly more about libre hardware
[03:55:01] * nckx has had relatively little dealings with the FSFE apart from publiccode.eu.
[03:55:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> nckx: when i tried to make a FSFE Czechia team they felt really racist and blocked it.. but a lot of things changed since that so i might try it again
[03:55:10] <KE0VVT> I'm still amazed at how mature Guix has gotten.  I can use it like a normie now.
[03:55:16] <nckx> M6piz7wk[m]: Yeesh.

[03:55:36] <nckx> KE0VVT: Wow.
[03:55:45] <nckx> I honestly didn't think it was quite that far yet.
[03:55:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> but that was at the time when DE to CZ relations were not great politically so probably affected by that
[03:56:06] <KE0VVT> nckx: Well, it's rough around the edges, of course.  Can't create users with GNOME, for example.
[03:56:18] <nckx> Right.  We should just disable that UI.
[03:56:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> i wouldn't call guix mature it has issues with quality assurance
[03:56:25] <nckx> But I'm probably repeating myself.
[03:56:33] <nckx> M6piz7wk[m] knows where it's at.
[03:56:35] * nckx agrees.
[03:56:53] * nckx also needs coffee o/
[03:56:56] <KE0VVT> nckx: It would be nice to add Guix support upstream, but I know that would be a tremendous amount of work.
[03:57:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> i wanted to work on curass to make QA checks but one person made it not worth it the effort

[04:01:20] <junebug> I would like to move away from gmail as my email provider and set up my own email service on my server. Can anyone recommed any good documentation for doing this with GPL software?

[04:02:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> same thing, but for software 
[04:02:31] <nckx> junebug: I learnt a lot from <https://workaround.org/ispmail> even without actually following it.
[04:02:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> to avoid common mistakes and such
[04:02:58] <junebug> thanks nckx 
[04:03:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> junebug: snopyta.org, protonmail.com,

[04:03:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> disroot.org
[04:03:24] <nckx> Ah, Postfix isn't GPL, if you specifically want that.
[04:03:35] <nckx> Can't give a GPL MX off the top of my head.
[04:03:52] <nckx> Oh, do you mean hosted or self-hosted?
[04:04:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> Postfix+Dovecot works great if you have DNSEC, DKIM, spamassassin and GPG set up
[04:04:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> so +- 90 EUR of work for someone who doesn't know what they are doing and another +-20~40 EUR annually to maintain it
[04:04:56] <KE0VVT> junebug: Warning: Email is HARD.
[04:04:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> but if you do know it's the best case scenario especially on something like hetzner 
[04:05:10] <M6piz7wk[m]> KE0VVT: disagree
[04:05:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> email is simple 
[04:05:16] <junebug> KE0VVT, is it? Oh boy
[04:05:31] <nckx> Yes, but.  It's perfectly feasible.
[04:05:36] <nckx> Lots of things are ‘hard’.
[04:05:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> also everyone can be like krey and just replace dialer on his phone and email with matrix
[04:05:51] <KE0VVT> nckx: It's harder than other services.
[04:06:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> nckx: especially when people are not making them harder 
[04:06:18] <nckx> It's more complex because ‘e-mail’ covers more than, say, ‘IRC logging’.
[04:06:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> KE0VVT: disagree it's probably one of the simplest services to set up
[04:06:34] <nckx> I'm not saying it's easy, but that's what makes it fun IMO.
[04:06:43] <nckx> Setting up ZNC is not ‘fun’.  Setting up e-mail *was*.
[04:07:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> setting bind9 is not fun it's hell thanks to FSF 
[04:07:15] <nckx> Building a house is hard, and you have to get a lot of things right, but it's perfectly doable if you take your time and actually do the work.
[04:07:25] * nckx might be getting sliiiightly off-metaphor.
[04:07:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> building house is not hard i've done and and planning on building another
[04:07:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> especially with those polystyrene molds that you just pour concrete into
[04:08:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's like lego 🌟_🌟
[04:08:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> .. lego that you have to excite with a vibrator
[04:08:24] <KE0VVT> I should have gotten tea.
[04:08:55] <KE0VVT> M6piz7wk[m]: This is not the place for vibrators, unless there is news that there are finally free software teledildonic devices.
[04:09:09] <nckx> I think it was clear what I meant.  It's a lot of components, it's not a one-night hacking session, and you'll definitely appreciate checklists after it all, but there is a clear path to success and plenty of people host their own mail.
[04:09:20] <nckx> The ‘mail is hard!!!’ meme is more damaging than the reality.
[04:09:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> KE0VVT: it's libre hardware 
[04:09:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> ECAD files and stuff available to public last time i checked
[04:09:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... lot of things in constructions are libre 
[04:09:54] <nckx> Just take it to mean ‘don't self-host your small business's mail the first month’ and you'll be fine.
[04:09:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> FSF is just blind to that 
[04:10:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> like self-hosting mail is just pressing a button in the UI these days
[04:11:08] * nckx works in construction, a little, and wishes to know how they can buy libre vibrators as a business expense.
[04:11:15] <nckx> …wat.
[04:11:28] <nckx> Yes, you can download mailinabox or whatever.
[04:11:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> the hosting solutions are providing apps.. so it's literally press a button and whooaaa service
[04:11:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> and they maintain it for you
[04:12:18] <nckx> And when it breaks you still get to keep the pieces.  Sounds like a great deal.
[04:12:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> when it breaks they fix it for you asap
[04:12:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> e.g https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/
[04:13:18] <nckx> I feel like you are describing a perfect simulacrum of hosted e-mail at this point, so what is, then, the point.  Just throw disroot a donation and you'll get the same thing with less headache.
[04:13:38] <nckx> You're not learning anything, you're not ‘hosting’ anything.
[04:13:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> you don't even have to donate to libreho.st people to get email
[04:14:16] <nckx> Indeed, I was trying to make the comparison more fair.
[04:14:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... at least i threatened perflyst with a knife and it worked~ 
[04:14:35] * nckx double checks ChanServ settings.
[04:15:11] <nckx> KE0VVT: Enjoy your tea, may it be of the correct colour; I am also going to do some enjoying.
[04:15:21] <nckx> Bye all.
[04:15:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> nckx: hurray don't come back
[04:15:39] <nckx> Sorry, I will.  ☹
[04:16:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> i should contribute more apps to hetzner https://github.com/hetznercloud/apps/tree/main/apps/hetzner/big-blue-button it seems simple enough
[04:16:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> basically a shell script.. might be cool to use guix

[06:28:58] <junebug> Any suggestions?
[06:30:07] <nckx> junebug: I don't think that's correct: https://guix.gnu.org/en/packages/icecat-91.4.0-guix0-preview1/
[06:30:31] <nckx> Though Guix might get ‘preferential treatment’ as far as the releases are concerned, I can't say.
[06:30:43] <nckx> But it's certainly not unmaintained as a project.
[06:31:15] <junebug> Oh I was going based on this: https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/
[06:31:24] <nckx> I see that gnu.org/s/gnuzilla still lists 67 as ‘latest release’.
[06:31:25] <nckx> Yeah.
[06:31:29] <junebug> latests release button leads to 67
[06:31:41] <nckx> I'd ask in #icecat junebug.

[06:41:46] <bandali> and like nckx mentioned, you can install an alpha/preview version of it based on latest firefox-esr via guix
[06:42:28] <junebug> bandali, great! I'm looking for something hackable in the same vein of emacs. Is this something that icecat offers?
[06:43:00] <junebug> For example, setting custom key bindings and custom behavior based on some conditions/logic
[06:44:04] <bandali> junebug, hmm unfortunately not so much, although icecat being free software you could customize it and build your own version, but it won't exactly be easy.  though you may be able to already achieve a good amount with an add-on like tridactyl, or with a window manager like EXWM or stumpwm
[06:44:23] <bandali> for something similar emacs's hackability in the web browser space, i'd perhaps look into Nyxt

[19:46:57] <Noisytoot> The Matrix bridge doesn't understand quiets.
[19:47:07] <Noisytoot> It doesn't support statusmsg or +z either.
