[03:57:06] <MootPoot> ?

[03:57:23] <MootPoot> radiotherapy is 80% risk of death?

[03:57:36] <MootPoot> oh you mean treated vs untreated?
[03:57:44] <Cryowolf> unless you attack it with chemotherapy after surgery
[03:57:51] <Cryowolf> it will almost surely come back and kill you
[03:58:13] <Cryowolf> radtiation therapy I guess helps lower the risk a bit more

[10:41:19] <amigojapan> saganman: this is the second time they lie to me
[10:41:30] <saganman> ouch
[10:41:41] <amigojapan> saganman: 12mbps is plenty fast

[10:44:23] <amigojapan> saganman: I may cancel my internet all together and really on 5g tethering
[10:44:42] <death916> phone companies here have limits on tethering
[10:44:45] <saganman> or just 4g tathering is good enough
[10:44:45] <death916> data cap
[10:44:50] <death916> well mayb not tethering
[10:44:52] <death916> but hotspot
[10:45:16] <saganman> my internet has data cap as well, the bandwidth is downgraded after 1000GB
[10:46:23] <amigojapan> saganman: I have tried on my slow phone which is 200kbps and I can do video calls, no problem on 4g
[10:46:28] *** Joins: treeman5 (~treeman5@user/treeman5)
[10:46:40] <amigojapan> saganman: and tomako's phone is 5g
[10:46:47] <Bco1981> amigojapan: is that 12mbps symetric ? both down and up ?
[10:46:48] <saganman> woah
[10:47:00] <Bco1981> amigojapan: usually up is a lot less
[10:47:06] <amigojapan> Bco1981: no. Up is probably slower
[10:47:25] <Bco1981> and you need atleast 2mbit up i would say for the online lectures.
[10:47:26] <saganman> I didn't know that Bco1981 
[10:47:51] <Bco1981> preferably the double up of what you actually need.
[10:47:56] <amigojapan> Bco1981: that's not true. I have done it on 200kbps
[10:48:56] <Bco1981> and the people on the other end had smooth video ?
[10:49:02] <amigojapan> Yes
[10:49:29] <Bco1981> okay, then it's pretty low res and low video kbit rate.
[10:49:46] <amigojapan> I once looked up Skype requirements. It was less than 200kbps
[10:50:12] <amigojapan> Low Res is fine
[10:54:50] <amigojapan> Bco1981: standards Skype video call rate is 128kbps, high quality is 400kbps
[10:55:07] <amigojapan> Standard is fine for me
[10:55:48] <amigojapan> Bco1981: no where near what your said
[10:55:55] *** Joins: arakimo (~arakimo@user/arakimo)
[10:56:51] <Bco1981> you have to have some room for browsing too, so it won't break the video/audio. that's why i said 2mbps you need room for data stream spikes.

[10:58:00] <Bco1981> that would make sense, as you send a "call" to each.

[10:58:07] <MootPoot> amigojapan: hey
[10:58:15] <MootPoot> I thought you said you didn't like 5g
[10:58:38] <MootPoot> Now here you are talking about teathering
[10:58:40] <MootPoot> Hmmk
[10:58:48] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot 
[10:58:57] <MootPoot> 2021: amigojapan becomes consumerist like MootPoot 
[10:59:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that is if I cancel my internet connection
[10:59:23] <MootPoot> How much is your 4g plan
[10:59:27] <amigojapan> MootPoot: my cable TV
[10:59:48] <MootPoot> If it's unlimited there are 4g wifi hotspots you can buy 
[10:59:54] <MootPoot> Well
[11:00:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: my 4g plan? 90usd per YEAR for unlimited internet
[11:00:11] <MootPoot> 4g wifi hotspots you can put a sim into 
[11:00:33] <MootPoot> amigojapan: unlimited at full speed or unlimited for a certain amount then throttled 
[11:00:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and tomako already had a 5g phone too
[11:01:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 200kbps which is enough for Skype
[11:01:31] <MootPoot> Just search up 4g hotspot on Amazon jp
[11:01:59] <amigojapan> MootPoot: what is it
[11:02:06] <MootPoot> Or I think there are a few which actually plug into your phone , so you teather a phone to the hotspot 
[11:02:34] <MootPoot> Basically a small wifi access point that gets its Internet from 4g or an attached device 
[11:02:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: oh you mean pocket WiFi. Why would i need that when I have a phone?
[11:03:07] <MootPoot> You use the wifi for your house 
[11:03:24] <MootPoot> Since you said you pay 90 usd for unlimited yearly 
[11:03:25] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you can do it with a phone too
[11:03:48] <Bco1981> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeXM7Y83UOo

[11:04:35] <amigojapan> MootPoot: she had her phone

[11:04:50] <MootPoot> If it's like that then why do you still pay for cable internet?
[11:04:56] <MootPoot> You don't even need 5g
[11:05:00] <MootPoot> Just use your phone

[11:05:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cause I am stupid
[11:05:23] <MootPoot> What
[11:05:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and tomako does not want me to cancel the gone internet
[11:06:08] <amigojapan> Home not gone
[11:06:48] <MootPoot> Yeah that's why you just replace it with a pocket wifi
[11:07:04] <MootPoot> She still gets home internet as far as she knows
[11:07:09] <MootPoot> You save money
[11:07:12] <MootPoot> Win win
[11:07:12] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 2 phones is fine
[11:07:48] <MootPoot> The problem is the WAF right?
[11:08:05] <MootPoot> And you pay more in home internet per year then 90 usd
[11:08:15] <amigojapan> Waf? What's that?
[11:08:23] <MootPoot> WAF= wife acceptance factor
[11:08:37] <amigojapan> Still don't get it
[11:08:51] <MootPoot> nvm
[11:08:54] <amigojapan> Ah wife
[11:09:02] <amigojapan> I thought you said wide
[11:09:06] <MootPoot> Lol
[11:09:12] <MootPoot> You calling tomako fat
[11:09:18] <MootPoot> She gonna be mad
[11:09:19] <amigojapan> Lol
[11:09:28] <MootPoot> Yeah but basically my point is 
[11:09:30] <Bco1981> amigojapan: usually in a relationship, the man wants some nice tech. but it does not fit the womans idea of decoration in the house... so he can't have it... WAF.
[11:09:39] <Bco1981> or some big speakers
[11:09:56] <amigojapan> I see Bco1981 
[11:09:57] <MootPoot> You have to make the change as unoticable as possible for a high WAF factor
[11:10:24] <MootPoot> So that's why I'm saying get pocket wifi, rename it to the same SSID and password as your current home internet
[11:10:29] <MootPoot> Then cancel the home internet
[11:10:35] <MootPoot> This way you save money 
[11:10:48] <MootPoot> And tomako does not think you don't have home wifi
[11:10:58] <Bco1981> and get some of that yandere action when she finds out.

[12:32:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well I'm making a java/kotlin game currently
[12:32:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan also did you see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZfuWMDEJpw
[12:32:13] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] EVANGELION: 3.0+1.01 THRICE UPON A TIME - Official Trailer | Prime Video | Duration: 1 minute, 32 seconds
[12:32:21] <amigojapan> Ah ok DunceCotus 
[12:32:37] <amigojapan> Let me see DunceCotus 
[12:32:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan streaming August 13 on Amazon Prime 
[12:33:31] <DunceCotus> Shinji doesn't look pleased
[12:33:37] <DunceCotus> but I am
[12:33:45] <death916> is he ever pleased
[12:33:54] <DunceCotus> death916 only thru pain
[12:34:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: good, that is sooner than we thought
[12:35:35] <DunceCotus> but why Amazon, why Anno why
[12:36:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: have you used the Amazon prime free trial period?
[12:36:29] <DunceCotus> no
[12:36:34] <DunceCotus> i'll just download it
[12:36:39] <DunceCotus> and buy blu-ray when its available
[12:36:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: ah ok
[12:36:59] <DunceCotus> not bothered with streaming platforms
[12:37:18] <DunceCotus> expensive and never have anything I want to watch
[12:37:27] <DunceCotus> except this one time
[12:37:58] <DunceCotus> I don't like this move to renting out everything
[12:38:19] <DunceCotus> entertainment, utilities, cars, homes, toothbrushes etc
[12:39:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think cars is better rented. Like the new car sharing programs they have in Japan
[12:39:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan but yeah im a dirty java dev
[12:39:37] <DunceCotus> nothing is better rented except for the vendor
[12:39:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I feel sorry for Java devs
[12:39:43] <death916> naw cars are
[12:39:47] <death916> so u dont lsoe value
[12:39:50] <death916> and only use it when u need
[12:39:55] <death916> especially in crammed cities
[12:40:09] <DunceCotus> capitalism has generated crammed cities
[12:40:21] <death916> no population has
[12:40:25] <DunceCotus> so why do we think we can use it to undo its error
[12:40:32] <death916> communist cities are just as crowded
[12:40:47] <death916> berlinw as crowded and was fascist
[12:40:48] <DunceCotus> death916 industrialisation caused more production caused births
[12:41:03] <DunceCotus> industrialisation is an outcome of capitalism
[12:41:18] <death916> no thats the product of technolgy increasin so our lives are easier
[12:41:27] <DunceCotus> are our lives easier?
[12:41:32] <death916> why would we want to make everyhthing by hand and walk when we can have factories and drive
[12:41:34] <death916> yes they are
[12:41:38] <death916> u dont have to draw well water
[12:41:41] <death916> shit outside
[12:41:47] <death916> u can drive to the store
[12:41:57] <DunceCotus> that may be more convenient yes
[12:42:00] <death916> i can talk to u hundreds or thousands of miles away instantly
[12:42:03] <DunceCotus> but we now have to worry about existential shit
[12:42:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: my life will be like 30 percent more by austere without an home internet connection
[12:42:24] <death916> im thinking of increasing my internet
[12:42:28] <death916> not decreasing
[12:42:30] <death916> want to get gug
[12:42:31] <death916> gig
[12:42:44] <amigojapan> death916: I want to save money
[12:42:52] <death916> i feel it, theres beter ways tho
[12:42:56] <death916> dont u work inna tech job
[12:43:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan halfway to monkdom
[12:43:07] <amigojapan> No death916 
[12:43:09] <Bco1981> death916: what on the internet do you user that requires 1gig internet ?
[12:43:10] <death916> o 
[12:43:14] <Bco1981> use*
[12:43:33] <DunceCotus> 1 giga..bit?
[12:43:43] <death916> torrents or remoting to my home server without lag nas 4 tvs with 4k playing
[12:44:02] <death916> trading
[12:44:11] <amigojapan> death916: I am a minimalist anyway
[12:44:21] <Bco1981> trading needs low latency, not high bandwidth
[12:44:39] <DunceCotus> TRADING? 
[12:44:45] <death916> true but it helps if im not congesting my etwwork
[12:44:47] <death916> cuz im watching shit
[12:44:49] <DunceCotus> pokemon cards yes
[12:44:55] <death916> n doin shit
[12:45:00] <death916> i lag now with 250mbps
[12:45:06] <death916> sometimes
[12:45:09] <death916> o ya plex
[12:45:12] <death916> can saturate it
[12:45:15] <death916> watching 4k hdr
[12:45:21] <DunceCotus> why do you need 4k
[12:45:26] <death916> cuz i havva 4k tv
[12:45:27] <death916> lool
[12:45:29] <DunceCotus> too detailed
[12:45:31] <death916> and surround sound
[12:45:42] <DunceCotus> too much pores
[12:45:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: people want the highest number thing
[12:45:54] <death916> i dont even download shit if its not 4k except anime or network tv shows
[12:45:56] <DunceCotus> that stuff makes me super self-conscious
[12:46:04] <death916> 4k is superior in every way
[12:46:08] <death916> its not about a bigger number
[12:46:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan do we?
[12:46:32] <death916> except file size i guess
[12:46:36] <DunceCotus> well its superior in that its higher res
[12:46:45] <DunceCotus> but it means you need a beefier connection too
[12:46:54] <DunceCotus> yeah and filesize
[12:46:56] <death916> i mean iu could get hd bluerays
[12:46:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: well the majority. It is proven that people pay more for features they will never use in things too

[12:47:32] <DunceCotus> 4k is less of a fad, I'll grant it that
[12:47:40] <death916> 4k is outdated alrdy
[12:47:48] <Bco1981> funny that 250mbps isn't enough. I have 250, i can torrent, steam download, 4K stream, and lots of 1080p youtube at the same time. i have no problems.
[12:48:13] <DunceCotus> I have a feeling death916 has multiple users
[12:48:16] <death916> yes
[12:48:38] <Bco1981> DunceCotus: i have 9. 2 teenager girls, and my own 2 kids.

[12:49:24] <death916> u watch compressed 4k unless u torerent it
[12:49:37] <DunceCotus> uncompressed raw 4k
[12:49:42] <death916> 2 4k over plex saturates my network
[12:49:45] <death916> jus about
[12:49:45] <DunceCotus> 20 TB per file
[12:49:50] <death916> thats small

[12:49:55] * DunceCotus snort
[12:50:02] <death916> o w8 tb
[12:50:05] <death916> lol
[12:50:08] <death916> htought u said gb
[12:50:08] <Bco1981> it's my sister and her husband that streams the 4K. netflix so yeah compressed.
[12:50:21] <death916> ya mad max 4k is a 65 gb file
[12:50:23] <death916> like 100mbs
[12:50:30] <death916> bitrate
[12:50:35] <DunceCotus> its just sickening to me
[12:50:37] <death916> ps
[12:50:39] <DunceCotus> seems a waste of space
[12:50:47] <death916> u havent experienced it
[12:50:50] <Bco1981> death916: but the plex is in your house is it not ?
[12:50:55] <DunceCotus> decadence
[12:51:09] <death916> partyly but i have 2 friends and a cousin that use it
[12:51:10] <death916> out of hosue
[12:51:16] <DunceCotus> googolplex
[12:51:17] <death916> i should prolly convert smaller files for that
[12:51:20] <death916> but itd take double space
[12:51:33] <death916> well like 1.5x
[12:51:42] <DunceCotus> death916 are you going to get 4k Eva 3.0+1.01?
[12:51:54] <DunceCotus> forkay
[12:51:54] <death916> if its on prime probably but idc bout 4k for anime
[12:52:07] <death916> hdr is nice tho
[12:52:12] <death916> but no anime rlly ahs it
[12:52:15] <DunceCotus> well the rebuilds are really good in high res
[12:52:17] <death916> some netflix ones do
[12:52:31] <death916> also 4k anime seasons woud b so much space
[12:52:34] <death916> mayb a movie
[12:52:45] <death916> i only have like 6tb rn

[12:53:31] <DunceCotus> 0th world problems
[12:53:40] <death916> lol
[12:53:46] <death916> Suzuthats small 4 a nas
[12:54:00] <DunceCotus> this is why I don't like the res-upmanship 
[12:54:28] <death916> u need to watch dunkirk or something like that in 4k hdr onna large screen with surround sound
[12:54:31] <death916> u wont wna go back
[12:54:35] <DunceCotus> dunkirk sucks
[12:54:41] <death916> nothing sucks in 4k
[12:54:42] <death916> smh
[12:54:52] <DunceCotus> dun crack in 4k
[12:54:53] <Bco1981> death916: i don't understand why the 4k has to be raw, you can't tell the difference of a 4K 100mbps rate vs a 4K 50mbps rate.
[12:54:58] <death916> u watchin shit in 720p stereo talkin bout shit sux
[12:55:02] <death916> u dont even getthe aritst vision
[12:55:14] <death916> it doesnt have to be raw even hvec can get up there
[12:55:20] <DunceCotus> death916 hollywood isn't really art
[12:55:23] <DunceCotus> at least not anymore
[12:55:23] <Bco1981> over rated
[12:55:37] <death916> 4k 50 vs 100 ur right no diff rlly
[12:55:41] <death916> 4k 25 vs 50 there is
[12:55:45] <Bco1981> yes
[12:55:49] <Bco1981> i agree on that one
[12:56:04] <DunceCotus> if its not uncompressed raw, may as well be for the birds
[12:56:05] <death916> or netflix 4k
[12:56:07] <death916> yuck
[12:56:10] <death916> its like 12 mbps
[12:56:13] <death916> or less
[12:56:16] <death916> idr
[12:56:18] <death916> but its low
[12:56:32] <DunceCotus> Netflix probably shouldn't advertise 4k
[12:56:47] <death916> they charge like 5 bux extra too
[12:57:01] <death916> i had 1080p rips higher BR in 2010
[12:57:57] <DunceCotus> 33 GB/minute for uncompressed raw super HD footage 
[12:58:15] <death916> no1 uses fuully ncompressed 
[12:58:19] <death916> u get x265
[12:58:25] <DunceCotus> 4 TB per movie
[12:58:28] <DunceCotus> get ON it
[12:58:41] <death916> one day youll understand
[12:58:49] <DunceCotus> death916 I am kidding
[12:59:18] <death916> my gf didnt know the joys of 4k + 5.1 and now she tells me when a movie doesnt sound right cuz its not in dolby/dts mode
[12:59:23] <Bco1981> i have a 4K tv, but i don't watch movies.
[12:59:31] <death916> i watch a shitton of movies
[12:59:40] <death916> sued to have the 10/month unlimited moviepass
[12:59:48] <death916> saw a movie like every other day in theatre for months
[12:59:53] <DunceCotus> you gotta have good sound setup to get the most out of 5.1 dolby/dts
[12:59:58] <death916> i do
[13:00:04] <DunceCotus> otherwise may as well watch with stereo
[13:00:08] <DunceCotus> death916 ok
[13:00:10] <death916> i have an onkyo receiver
[13:00:46] <death916> i install surround sound  for work.. well used to i still do on side
[13:01:27] <Bco1981> but 5.1 is a limping sound system. All the explosions is only coming from 1 corner of the room, everytime. that ruins the immersion for me.

[14:21:53] <death916> no prob amigojapan, and at least some should go to the artist. prolly not much
[14:21:57] <death916> or i think they got paid alrdy

[18:14:55] <TsundereNoises> you sort of pull apart the lobster bit by bit and get out the little bits of meat
[18:15:16] <TsundereNoises> I mean, you could get lobster meat in something, already prepared, but that's nowhere near as good tasting

[19:10:34] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it's also a classic spaghetti western that's really famous, and a later modern western that has only a bit to do with the original that was also decently famous
[19:11:01] <TsundereNoises> I actually think the modern one is the better movie, just it's different enough I don't think you can really call it a remake
[19:11:21] <amigojapan> What language is it in?
[19:11:27] <TsundereNoises> english
[19:11:32] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[19:11:57] <TsundereNoises> and the original is in Italian
[19:12:04] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[19:12:17] <TsundereNoises> Sukiyaki Western Django is in Japanese
[19:12:28] <TsundereNoises> Django Unchained (modern good western) is in English
[19:12:32] <amigojapan> Oh now you confused me
[19:12:41] <TsundereNoises> Django (1960s spaghetti western) is in Italian
[19:12:47] <TsundereNoises> hope that clears it up
[19:12:50] <TsundereNoises> 3 movies
[19:12:57] <TsundereNoises> not really related other than title and some themes
[19:12:57] <amigojapan> Ah 3 different movies
[19:13:04] <DunceCotus> D'jango
[19:13:20] <TsundereNoises> the d is silent
[19:13:29] <DunceCotus> Cunchanged
[19:13:59] <DunceCotus> the d is silent except after c
[19:14:14] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: westerns are kind of dead. But samurai shows are still being made
[19:14:46] <DunceCotus> amigojapan hmm even "Westworld" is mostly not set in the West
[19:15:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that's science fictions
[19:15:15] <DunceCotus> its set in a futuristic theme park made to look like the "wild West" as well as other historic (and futuristic) locales
[19:16:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I was disappointed when I learned they were robots. I thought it was vr and ai
[19:16:06] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'd recommend Django Unchained (2012, English) and Sukiyaki Western Django (2007, Japanese), but Django (1966, Italian) only if you're really into old westerns, it's not as good as it's inspiration (Yojimbo, 1961, Japanese)
[19:16:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well season 2 ... I won't spoil it
[19:16:33] <DunceCotus> not that its that great anyway
[19:16:38] <amigojapan> Oh I have heard of yojimbo
[19:16:57] <DunceCotus> Yojimbo unphased
[19:17:05] <ButterNoodle> thats a good one
[19:17:21] <amigojapan> Brb I really need to prepare my medicines
[19:17:28] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I took the time to look up dates on all of them to try to clarify
[19:17:31] <TsundereNoises> instead of "the old one"
[19:17:41] <Urchin[emacs]> A Fistfull of Dollars is the better Italian western remake of Yojimbo
[19:17:53] <TsundereNoises> yes
[19:17:54] <amigojapan> Thanks a lot TsundereNoises 
[19:18:01] <TsundereNoises> I agree with Urchin
[19:18:07] <TsundereNoises> but Yojimbo is better than eithre
[19:18:08] <ButterNoodle> a fishfull of dollars is a good futurama episode

[19:37:30] <Roey> <amigojapan> Roey: I was kidding on how Hebrew is written without the vowels <- oh yeah i know :) but in referene to what, something I said?
[19:37:39] <Nanobot> amigojapan: "The word was coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena." - Wikipedia
[19:37:44] <Bco1981> Nanobot: Star sign ?
[19:37:53] <amigojapan> Nanobot: is written caliope in katakana. And that is basically phonetic. So it beats romaji
[19:37:55] <Nanobot> Bco1981: Ca-Leo-pe
[19:38:07] <Bco1981> ah
[19:38:17] <Roey> oh
[19:38:22] <DunceCotus> reminds me of that song

[19:38:48] <Nanobot> amigojapan: But Calli said that when she came up with the name, she had the "calaiope" pronunciation in mind. She didn't think about how the name would be transliterated in Japanese.

[19:49:01] <DunceCotus> I think a big part of learning wordses is sounds
[19:50:05] <amigojapan> Nanobot: or maybe it is the opposite problem. A pre existing reading
[19:50:11] <amigojapan> Let me check
[19:50:14] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: there's a standard way to katakanize my real first name, and I don't think it sounds as much like how we actually say it as another option
[19:51:58] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: on the other hand, not sure I want to fight that battle, because I suspect the more "correct" way would sound kind of dumb, and neither is really correct anyway
[19:51:59] <Nanobot> In Japanese, everyone calls me Kimigasuki.
[19:52:02] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: when you come to Japan you get to katakanize it the way you want in official documents, but later they make you stick to that
[19:52:33] <amigojapan> Hehehe Nanobot 
[19:53:46] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: my name is very unique so there is no standards way
[19:54:20] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I have a very common name

[19:57:48] <amigojapan> Nanobot: in Eli's Island NY family name was padovich, but they changed it in the documents to Padow
[19:59:09] <amigojapan> Nanobot: and my great grand father in my grandmother's side of the family was called us Hershel shifrish, but they changed his name to Harry Harris

[20:19:45] <DunceCotus> its like those myths you hear about demons or faeries etc.

[20:20:22] <DunceCotus> and/or it summons them
[20:20:26] <TsundereNoises> wow, DunceCotus doesn't know how data or faeries work
[20:20:44] <TsundereNoises> read a damn book
[20:20:58] <DunceCotus> that's why they liked to be called fair folk
[20:21:05] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises oi
[20:21:35] <TsundereNoises> the idea is the true name gives you POWER over the whatever
[20:21:44] <DunceCotus> dammed enough already (DEA)

[20:23:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: yes
[20:23:19] <TsundereNoises> well there you go amigojapan
[20:23:46] <TsundereNoises> either the passenger manifest spelled it dumb, or he changed it as was extraordinarily common
[20:23:55] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I think this article was invented to hide that people back then we're tremendously racist
[20:24:07] <TsundereNoises> the point of the article isn't to deny that names changed, it's to deny that it was some specific function of the actual Ellis Island inspector
[20:24:12] <TsundereNoises> which is true
[20:24:31] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but it doesn't hide that people were tremendously racist…
[20:24:38] <amigojapan> Yeah that is what they would want us to think
[20:24:50] <TsundereNoises> this is a conspiracy theory that accomplishes nothing and has quite a bit of documentation
[20:24:52] <DunceCotus> Also the Statue of Liberty used to be on Ellis Ilsand
[20:24:59] <DunceCotus> now its Liberty Island or something
[20:25:04] <DunceCotus> also mandela'd
[20:25:14] <DunceCotus> so there is PRECEDENT for that whole area being retconned
[20:25:22] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: is still on Ellis Island

[20:25:37] <ButterNoodle> THEY MOVED THE STATUE OF LIBERTY???
[20:25:38] <DunceCotus> amigojapan sorry, it used to be on Liberty Island
[20:25:44] <DunceCotus> now its Ellis

[20:26:02] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: amigojapan knows the truth, he won't fall for this coverup
[20:26:09] <ButterNoodle> ikrite
[20:26:49] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: you think historical document have never been fabricated?
[20:27:11] <DunceCotus> I think the statue of liberty actually comes from a civilisation erased from history
[20:27:13] <Roey> <DunceCotus> Also the Statue of Liberty used to be on Ellis Ilsand
[20:27:13] <Roey> <DunceCotus> now its Liberty Island or something
[20:27:20] <DunceCotus> that pre-existed our capitalist-industrialist society
[20:27:23] <Roey> the statue is actually a shell around the Mecha of Liberty
[20:27:28] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I think historical documents are harder to fabricate without getting caught than you think, and are only done so when it serves either a financially or nationalistic agenda

[20:28:50] <DunceCotus> as they have the power
[20:29:01] <death916> cern has no power lol
[20:29:07] <DunceCotus> CERN has a fucktonne of power
[20:29:14] <death916> electrical power ya
[20:29:30] <TsundereNoises> they've just edited the time stream to make you THINK they just control a particle collider
[20:29:30] <DunceCotus> like entire countries' electrical grid scale power
[20:29:34] <Cryowolf> cern needs it, the cost of crashing particles is enormous
[20:29:53] <Roey> SERN has tremendous poewr
[20:29:55] <death916> btc uses countries entire elctrical grid of power too
[20:29:56] <DunceCotus> my point is this amount of literal power, consolidated in a relatively small area
[20:30:00] <Roey> just see Steins;Gate

[20:34:44] <TsundereNoises> if you try hard enough, you can explain EVERYTHING with a conspiracy theory
[20:35:02] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises then doesn't that imply the theory is right?

[20:37:45] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises why would old people lie?

[21:07:03] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: Japanese historians have a fair amount of blind spots, for example, ninja studies are mostly western
[21:07:07] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I don't want to fight you, you're right
[21:07:25] <ButterNoodle> Urchin[emacs]: thats a lie.. no one can record a ninja's movements
[21:07:28] <Cryowolf> read up on the Mandela effect (it's a psychological event where something that isn't true becomes the common accepted reality)
[21:07:31] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it's confused because there's 2 arguments that are kind of different things
[21:07:45] <Cryowolf> there's a joke about the Berenstein/Berenstain children books
[21:07:49] <DunceCotus> it is both true that they changed immigrants' names on Ellis Island, AND that they changed those names on the boats before coming to Ellis Island
[21:07:53] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but the community of academics in general don't buy the Japanese government's bullshit
[21:07:54] <Cryowolf> where people remember the Stein/Stain wrongly
[21:07:56] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf: yea we are drinking the mandela effect - 40oz version in the 2020's
[21:07:56] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: all I am saying is that all history academics are the same. We can't trust them
[21:08:03] <Cryowolf> and as such thing they crossed over to another universe
[21:08:13] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: eh, wtf?
[21:08:16] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, and don't you forget it
[21:08:17] <ButterNoodle> lol
[21:08:24] <ButterNoodle> thats some funny shit amigojapan...
[21:08:32] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf its not misremembering
[21:08:42] <DunceCotus> its legitimate alternate reality
[21:09:00] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: there are endless disagreements between histories of different countries. It is not this one disagreement
[21:09:06] <DunceCotus> however the two realities merged
[21:09:10] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan basically doesn't believe we can know anything about history, so chooses to believe random conspiracies because that's what he wants to believe
[21:09:16] <mixfix41> but the guys that can memories the material will pick the good ones
[21:09:27] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: what happens when multiple records coincide and confirm?
[21:10:30] *** Quits: kalekale (~kalekale@2400:1a00:b011:ba73:6467:e65d:5639:72e3) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[21:10:31] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but no historians from other countries disagree with what that link you sent says as far as I can tell
[21:10:49] <ButterNoodle> I think in science when multiple observers record the same results hypothesis becomes theory becomes law
[21:10:53] <ButterNoodle> amirite?
[21:11:03] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and why would they? You're saying the government faked a big paper trail to accomplish basically nothing
[21:11:16] <ButterNoodle> lizard people
[21:11:27] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: who knows. Maybe they are allies. Maybe they are right in that particular case. But I wood argue there is more they disagree about. And again. Nobody knows what is going on right now, right now, so nobody will be able to write an accurate history of now
[21:11:47] <Cryowolf> a hypothesis can't contain more than one assumption, everything else must be true
[21:11:51] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I mean, actually not really but my pedantry tank is almost empty so I won't fight you on it
[21:11:55] <Cryowolf> or it's just speculation
[21:12:04] <ButterNoodle> I think that is a misguided approach to the world around you.. might as well pretend ur in the matrix
[21:12:24] <TsundereNoises> ^
[21:12:36] <ButterNoodle> this fucking steak tasted great! even though its fake!
[21:12:56] <TsundereNoises> and then you realize that if you're living in the matrix, you may as well just accept that it's real ANYWAY, even if you can't know for sure
[21:12:56] <ButterNoodle> these tiddies feel great! even thou they are fake!
[21:13:05] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I believe there is one truth. But I don't believe we can record it properly
[21:13:08] <ButterNoodle> them fucker are real if I can smell em and tast em
[21:13:10] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises there are variations on real
[21:13:10] <TsundereNoises> epistemology is a good drug
[21:13:11] <Cryowolf> we can never know if the history of ancient civilizations are correct, because history is written by the victor. However when it comes to recent history, that
[21:13:14] <Cryowolf> that's different
[21:13:24] <ButterNoodle>  I believe there is one truth - some religious guy
[21:13:26] <mixfix41> its a good reference'
[21:13:40] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf its really no different
[21:13:53] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: du u have to be omnipotent to do it?
[21:14:31] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: we don't even now what is happening right now. Look at all the confusion. Don't you think everyone will record a different narrative about right now?
[21:14:35] <Cryowolf> DunceCotus, recent history that has just been witnessed is far more easy to testify its accuracy than 3000 years ago
[21:14:35] <ButterNoodle> is the internet god?
[21:14:54] <ButterNoodle> hey god it's me ButterNoodle
[21:14:57] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, I do, but WE know our recent history is what I'm saying
[21:14:57] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: definitely super human
[21:15:15] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, but why do you think history works by picking one contemporary narrative and believing it?
[21:15:20] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: no. We don't even know the present
[21:15:21] <Cryowolf> what will they say about today in 2000 years and how accurate will it be? I have no id ea
[21:15:30] <ButterNoodle> where is theholyduck to weigh in on this conspiracy of modern history
[21:15:31] <Cryowolf> I know the present around me
[21:15:35] <ButterNoodle> I demand answers
[21:15:46] * ButterNoodle gibs Cryowolf a present
[21:15:51] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it picks what is convenient
[21:16:12] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: he may been me
[21:16:23] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, thank you. But I already killed Little Timmy, took his candycane apple. Killed a boy with a Turkey, stuffed the Turkey with the candy cane and now I'm in a heated argument with Little Timmy
[21:16:27] <Cryowolf> 's dad
[21:16:28] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: he may ban me
[21:16:31] <ButterNoodle> get been'ed amigojapan 
[21:16:37] <Cryowolf> and Scrooge gave me a penny for the laugh
[21:17:04] <ButterNoodle> occam's razor on the validity of events as they happen
[21:17:18] <Cryowolf> yep
[21:17:19] <ButterNoodle> that really shoots pizzagate in the foot
[21:17:44] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: you're just being factually wrong about how history works in the sense of history as a field of study
[21:17:45] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: tell me. Did the republicans really win the election?
[21:18:00] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: you basically keep insisting on blatantly untrue things, that's why I am having trouble dropping it
[21:18:05] <TsundereNoises> not talking about the conspiracy thing
[21:18:25] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: which republicans? many won this past election year
[21:18:52] <mixfix41> you have to know the economy thats only one variable
[21:18:55] <Cryowolf> I go by whatever available information I have, I try to apply critical thinking as far as I can manage it and make my choices from there. I can make my own deductions, which may be wrong, but I don't see what else I can do except fall into pure and absolute apathy
[21:18:58] <Cryowolf> which I won't
[21:18:59] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: come on you know I mean trump
[21:19:04] <ButterNoodle> if ur talking about the presidential election.. the record still stands that biden got around 10M more votes
[21:19:16] <Roey> what's this gotta do with Trump?
[21:19:30] <Cryowolf> god damn it not the election US politics thing again
[21:19:37] <ButterNoodle> no I dont.. American politics isnt just about the president.. it'd be great it people understood that a tiny bit
[21:19:39] <Roey> ButterNoodle: lol yeah, totally non-fradulant elections, 100%
[21:19:44] <Cryowolf> it's worse than cancer and I can testify to that cause I have cancer
[21:19:52] <Roey> Cryowolf: hey
[21:19:52] <amigojapan> Roey: people disagreeing about what's going on in the present. That is what it is about
[21:19:54] <mixfix41> i think we've been at constant war though
[21:20:02] <mixfix41> at this point in history since 2001
[21:20:12] <ButterNoodle> Roey: didnt say that.. I'm just repeating what is on record... that 150M americans turned out to vote - or so
[21:20:36] <Roey> ButterNoodle: yeah, totally non-fradulant, 100%.
[21:20:41] <Roey> *fraudulant
[21:20:58] <Roey> sheeple keep sheepling
[21:21:14] <ButterNoodle> I wont contest that because some people will start breathing heavy through their neck beards and start typing real hard about it in there
[21:21:17] <ButterNoodle> *here
[21:21:26] <Cryowolf> Please no...I realize how selfish it is for myself  to say "stop talking about this", but ffs the dead horse has been beaten so much that all that's left is rotting sludge
[21:21:33] <Cryowolf> do we have to beat the sludge?
[21:21:37] <amigojapan> Roey: both sides will write it down as history. Who the people of the future believe is still too be seen
[21:21:38] <ButterNoodle> tbh
[21:21:40] <ButterNoodle> idc
[21:21:44] <ButterNoodle> and havent
[21:21:56] <ButterNoodle> some people still like to bring it up
[21:21:58] <Cryowolf> do we really have to talk about the US election and politics, AGAIN? Trump...AGAIN?
[21:22:22] <ButterNoodle> I was avoiding it.. but amigojapan wanted to specify that in particular
[21:22:30] <Cryowolf> go to twitter if you wanna do th at, there's millions of people that will be happy to fight about it
[21:22:33] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: we are taking about what is happening right now
[21:22:36] <ButterNoodle> as an out to discuss history's accuracy
[21:22:49] <Cryowolf> and what is happening right now?
[21:22:52] <ButterNoodle> I'ma go take a shit
[21:22:58] <ButterNoodle> and get some coffee
[21:23:00] <Cryowolf> and where? and to whom does it mat ter?
[21:23:01] <ButterNoodle> bbl
[21:23:04] <Cryowolf> matter*
[21:23:28] * ButterNoodle plops mic
[21:23:32] <amigojapan> Cryowolf it will matter when it becomes "history"
[21:23:39] <mixfix41> if you have the energy what is there to gain
[21:23:43] <mixfix41> even
[21:23:46] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, again, matter to who?
[21:23:46] <mixfix41> good insight
[21:24:15] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: seems to matter to me and TsundereNoises eventho we disagree
[21:24:18] <Cryowolf> and how do you know this will be more than an annoying footnote barely worthy of a sentence?
[21:24:31] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: yeah, amigo brought us into this and I checked out
[21:24:42] <TsundereNoises> I didn't want to talk about this
[21:25:05] <TsundereNoises> it's an offshoot, but it mostly seems like just stirring up drama rather than addressing what we were actually takling about
[21:26:22] <Cryowolf> our lifespan is really short and most of us live in our own social bubbles and whatnot. Where we're from, our family, friends, religion, culture, tradition etc also change our perception. We might think what's happening now is a great event but we can't possibly know anyone 200 years from now will give a shit
[21:26:36] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: there are things we actually agree were falsified, like the forced prostitution of Koreans during ww2. But the Japanese government is trying to charge that
[21:27:05] <TsundereNoises> yes but outside Japan everyone knows that's BS
[21:27:13] <Cryowolf> I see. Are you denying it ever happened anywherer at all?
[21:27:18] <TsundereNoises> and yes, THAT kind of thing happens all the time, it's not just Japan
[21:27:28] <Cryowolf> as in not even in a single corner, a single house, a single person
[21:27:38] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I am saying historians do lie
[21:27:50] <TsundereNoises> I was originally arguing about a specific other thing where the US government stand to gain nothing but Amigo thinks they have a conspiracy for shits and giggles
[21:27:57] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, it does...it's very common in war, especially when people feel they don't have to be accountable
[21:28:03] <TsundereNoises> and now I'm arguing about the fundamentals of how history as a field of study works
[21:28:46] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: and why are you an authority on that?
[21:29:00] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I don't know what you're talking about, but it's pretty clear you also don't know what I'm talking about because that sentence doesn't make sense with the context of this debate
[21:29:12] <mixfix41> that stuff needs records
[21:29:28] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, yes they do, people lie. Everybody lies, to ourselves, to others. Sometimes we also create false memory that we believe above all else is real, when it isn't. The accuracy of recorded events becomes less and less accurate the more time passes
[21:29:38] <amigojapan> mixfix41: records are constantly falsified
[21:29:42] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm not particularly an authority, but you're some kind of anti-authority for how off you seem to be about fundamental concepts here
[21:30:01] <mixfix41> true but if you have no arithmetic

[21:30:44] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, no it's not clear that I don't know what you're talking about. It could be as easy as us using different language to describe things, or we're trying to explain different parts of the same whole
[21:31:25] <Cryowolf> actually I take that back
[21:31:36] * TsundereNoises clubs cryowolf to death with a Wittgenstein book
[21:31:38] <Cryowolf> I'm pretty sure none of us know what we're talking about and we're all arguing different things
[21:31:51] <Cryowolf> or just talking about different things
[21:31:58] <Bco1981> perfect
[21:32:15] <Cryowolf> so the best would be to leave it at that
[21:32:17] <ButterNoodle> ask god
[21:32:21] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: philosophically maybe, I was implying you should read up 3 lines or so because you seemed to be thinking I was arguing on the side of the Japanese government
[21:32:22] <ButterNoodle> !quote god
[21:32:22] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: (2 / 2) <god> i just shoved a watermelon up my man cunt with nothing but i can't believe it's not butter for lube
[21:32:43] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, I did, he shoved a watermelon up his ass and shot seeds at me
[21:32:52] <ButterNoodle> nice
[21:32:59] <Cryowolf> No it was pretty brutal
[21:33:06] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: what will historians in China record about Corona and what will historians in the US record about it. Maybe both will be wrong. Both counties seen to blame reach other
[21:33:28] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, I'm aware
[21:33:33] <amigojapan> Good
[21:34:09] <Cryowolf> I'm not saying who is right or wrong, but groups, however small or large will obviously think of themselves first
[21:34:24] <Cryowolf> and want to gain an advantage
[21:34:39] <Cryowolf> nothing strange about that
[21:34:49] <amigojapan> So there is no actual consensus. And it does not really matter of there is a consensus cause nobody knows what it true. But something will be written as if it were true
[21:36:38] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yeah each country trends to write what naritive is convenient for them
[21:37:00] <amigojapan> Even as a Mexican I know Mexico has done it
[21:37:41] <amigojapan> I know I have done it. And I don't see why historians get a social pass
[21:37:42] <Cryowolf> It's impossible to be omniscient to all facts. We use what's available, apply as much critical thinking as we're capable and then act on it
[21:37:58] <mixfix41> whatever happens they dont want to disturb the terracotta tomb 
[21:38:04] <mixfix41> that thing is curse
[21:38:10] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: who is "we"?
[21:38:46] <Cryowolf> human beings
[21:38:50] <Cryowolf> people
[21:39:23] <Cryowolf> we're not omniscient so we have to act on something, whether it's true, accurate or not

[21:39:53] <mixfix41> this must be the japanese pronounciation: へいばよう

[21:42:05] <Cryowolf> Generalizing things helps us reach decisions faster and avoid being paralyzed when it comes to acting
[21:42:07] <TsundereNoises> that's one where out of context improves it

[21:43:11] <amigojapan> It's is most difficult to apply critical thinking to one's own beliefs

[22:00:10] <Nanobot> There are lots of "air purifier" products that actually just pump out ozone, which smells good but is basically pollution.

[22:54:38] <ButterNoodle> I can feel it between my knees when I'm freeballin
[22:54:45] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: there are viruses that infect bacteria rather than us, those are indirectly helpful
[22:55:10] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I remember reading about a philosopher that discovered air by making bubbles in water
[22:55:17] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: there's also some hypotheses that viruses mayb ahev been helpful for certain helpful mutations in the past
[22:55:36] <TsundereNoises> but as far as actual viruses infecting you, I don't think any are helpful, their reproducing is at least a drain on resources even if nothing else

[22:56:35] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: ah. Interesting. So there could be a treatment which actually introduces a virus into a person on purpose
[22:56:50] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: ABSOLUTELY, although for that to be useful we'd need to engineer the viruses
[22:57:01] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but yeah, that's something we'll probably be doing in our lifetimes
[22:57:15] <TsundereNoises> well, maybe
[22:57:28] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: the problem is making the viruses target things specifically enough
[22:57:29] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: fun
[22:57:59] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: sounds like we can make a new kind of antibiotic
[22:58:08] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: but as far as natural viruses in nature, the best you can hope for is really "so slightly harmful that you don't notice
[22:58:11] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: like warts
[22:58:21] <TsundereNoises> most warts are caused by a virus, no one ever died of a wart
[22:58:33] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: no, antibiotics are a totally different thing
[22:59:02] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and yes, we SHOULD be researching new antibiotics, but much like the new mrna vaccines, no one wants to fund that research until we get to some point where we needed it 6 months ago

[22:59:20] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I mean virus treatment that kills harmful bacteria
[22:59:35] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, that's possible, but that's not what antibiotics are
[23:00:07] <amigojapan> Right. Sorry TsundereNoises 
[23:00:33] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: the problem with that is making sure the virus only hits the cells you want to hit, nothing else, and a lot of times there are just simpler, easier ways
[23:00:54] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I see
[23:01:24] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: where viruses are likely to be a good technique are things like cancer, and maybe, in near-future-scifi world for genetic disesase
[23:02:18] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I am allergic to penicillin. So such a treatment may be good for me
[23:03:05] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah you're not that likely to be allergic to other antibiotics, and those are easier, cheaper, and more effective
[23:03:25] <amigojapan> Several antibiotics cause me to have 蕁麻疹and itch
[23:03:46] <amigojapan> I see
[23:03:57] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it seems unlikely that'd be all antibiotics though, there are some that are very different from each other, that'd be really bad luck

[23:04:26] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: antibiotics are many orders of magnitude cheaper than some experimental viral therapy would be
[23:05:37] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I think the ones I am allergic to are all related to penicillin. And even tho I keep telling doctors I am allergic to penicillin. They have prescribed similar things
[23:05:43] * ButterNoodle gibs S_T_A_N a nibble
[23:05:53] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[23:06:08] <S_T_A_N> yesss
[23:07:01] <amigojapan> I am unsure if that is computer talk
[23:07:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I keep getting the impression that the japanese health care system is just really stupid
[23:07:25] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: when you tell me about your dealings with the hospital
[23:08:01] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and yeah, there are a bunch of different penicillin offshoots, it's definitely possible to be allergic to all of those (although also to just some of them)
[23:08:08] <amigojapan> Yeah. It is TsundereNoises .I need to go to the clinic tomorrow too
[23:08:11] <TsundereNoises> but that's only a subset of antibiotics in general

[23:32:04] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: on the up side, doctors tend to prescribe antibiotics way too often, so you're helping out in that sense
[23:34:22] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises .I will ask the doctor if there is a test to know exactly what I am allergic to
[23:35:02] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: with my pollen allergy, a blood test told me exactly what I was allergic to
[23:35:11] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: there are tests
[23:35:18] <amigojapan> Ah good

[23:35:28] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: (207 / 457) <B​utterNoodle> on an average day.. I feel like a dirty old man... but that makes me realize someone else needs to feel me like a dirty old man
[23:35:36] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: what's weirder is that this keeps coming up and there's no note in a file somewhere
[23:36:00] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: yeah
[23:36:05] <TsundereNoises> amigo is allergic to pennicillin, stop fucking giving it to him
[23:36:15] <ButterNoodle> lol
[23:36:32] <ButterNoodle> I'm allergic to cute girls... pls gib me more
[23:36:36] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: there are a lot of false positive penicillin allergies, I wonder if that made the doctors ignore this?
[23:36:43] <ButterNoodle> my pp get swollen something terrible
[23:37:05] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I think actually a majority of penicillin allergies in the US aren't real, but of course plenty of people DO actually have them too
[23:37:17] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: in my case.. I'm so allergic to -cillin like stuff my kid inherited it
[23:37:40] <TsundereNoises> but for a while a lot of them were being recorded that weren't real things with kids, then those stayed on record for life and people went through life always thinking they had them so it becomes ingrained
[23:37:45] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: you will think it is really bad cause the last time they have me something close to penicillin. The pharmacy called me at home and asked me if I was ok. Cause that actually was close to penicillin
[23:37:52] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: oh yeah, it's totally a real thing too
[23:38:10] <mixfix41> those are the meds they use the shaking machines to make
[23:38:37] <ButterNoodle> I cant take cefaclor either
[23:38:45] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: lol, at least SOMEONE is paying attention, even if not the doctor
[23:39:06] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: yeah like it's a decently common allergy, it's just ALSO hugely overreported due to false positives
[23:39:08] <TsundereNoises> which makes it hard
[23:39:33] <ButterNoodle> its similar enough to it that it almost kills me too
[23:39:36] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that is after they gave them to me tho. It took them a while to notice
[23:39:43] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I have 1 cousin who is actually allergic, and 1 who was told she was but turned out not to be
[23:40:22] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan … this should be something they're checking automatically when they prescribe drugs and again when they hand out drugs
[23:40:42] <ButterNoodle> dr gave me cefaclore and sent me on my marry way.. I took my morning dose and had to pull off the road because  I was seeing stars, and puked my guts out
[23:40:58] <TsundereNoises> that's terrible
[23:41:00] <ButterNoodle> then felt pins and needles all over my body
[23:41:33] <ButterNoodle> *made it back home, my dad said I look like I had ebola - bright red all over
[23:41:54] <ButterNoodle> felt better later...
[23:42:06] <ButterNoodle> dr said told me I should have gone to the ER
[23:42:14] <TsundereNoises> yeah realy
[23:42:31] <TsundereNoises> allergic reactions can get bad
[23:42:52] <ButterNoodle> 19 yo me was like "wow, so thats what anaphylactic shock is like"
[23:43:55] <ButterNoodle> today me would have someone drive me to the ER.. 
[23:44:00] <ButterNoodle> damn
[23:44:01] <MootPoot> hmm
[23:44:12] <ButterNoodle> ig I need me 2nd wife to be a nurse too
[23:44:14] <MootPoot> considering getting a hepa air filter thing
[23:44:20] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: can I be ur second wife
[23:44:26] <TsundereNoises> I ship it

[23:44:53] <MootPoot> HEY
[23:44:57] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you probably do not need to waste money on an air filter
[23:45:02] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I bet you did not have a cell phone yet
[23:45:16] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  my AC filter keeps clogging up with dust and shit
[23:45:19] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I actually did.. I was an early technology adopter
[23:45:19] <MootPoot> every 2 days
[23:45:20] <TsundereNoises> I mean, unless you have a real reason, but I assume you're just being a hypochondriac
[23:45:30] <ButterNoodle> $65 for 50 min or something
[23:45:35] <ButterNoodle> per month
[23:45:44] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you got a lot of dustt
[23:45:45] <MootPoot> I dont think having to clean filters multiple times a week is normal
[23:45:51] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: it's not
[23:46:01] <ButterNoodle> problem was amigojapan, no one else had them - and it was the middle of the day when everyone was at work or school 
[23:46:03] <amigojapan> Expressive ButterNoodle 
[23:46:07] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I thought you meant something different, thought you were having an #anime weirdo moment
[23:46:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: get that filter, damn
[23:46:14] <MootPoot> oh
[23:46:16] <MootPoot> well
