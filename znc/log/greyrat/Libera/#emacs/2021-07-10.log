[02:07:08] <lisp123> Controversial Question
[02:07:31] <lisp123> Is there a way for me to create apps with an Emacs backend (similar to how electron has a chrome backend)?

[02:07:35] <wgreenhouse> Aurora_v_kosmose: crims, much like other businesscritters, often think something is better if it's exclusive and expensive 
[02:07:46] <lisp123> Of course it would be GPL :)
[02:08:02] <wgreenhouse> and the pdf was for Aurora_v_kosmose's lispos cult ;-0
[02:08:14] <acdw> lisp123: there's that one project, um, https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsXWidgets ???
[02:08:15] <fsbot> Inconceivable!
[02:08:24] <acdw> no fsbot, it's true

[02:09:31] <wgreenhouse> > Is there a way for me to create apps with an Emacs backend (similar to how electron has a chrome backend)?
[02:09:31] <wgreenhouse> I mean, I would characterize any elisp library that isn't a pure text/programming editor mode as that
[02:09:40] <wgreenhouse> e.g. gnus is an "emacs app"
[02:09:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^ 
[02:10:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Gnus and ERC are the two examples that come to mind as full-fledged "applications"
[02:10:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> org-mode too, I guess, but it's sort of a literate programming thing.
[02:10:23] <wgreenhouse> distribution can be in the form of specialized initfile setups
[02:10:57] <acdw> yeah inherit from special-mode?
[02:10:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (i.e. close-enough to the original Emacs purpose it can't be that easily separated from it)

[02:15:47] <aidalgol> lisp123: That sounds like... not Emacs.

[02:19:02] <aidalgol> acdw, cvanduse`: Everyone who wanted to do that went off to use gopher instead, and then some of those people wrote their own protocol so the filthy web couldn't taint their pure text.
[02:19:10] <wgreenhouse> lisp123: what about stuff like portacle or scimax that makes emacs a tool dedicated to a particular use case
[02:19:28] <lisp123> jfb4: not entirely sure, just some slight changes at the moment
[02:20:00] <lisp123> wgreenhouse: yes, I think portacle might be the best case study - it was sbcl packaged in, has all the relevant packages (it deems) installed
[02:20:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> aidalgol: It should be fairly feasible to add gemini and other protocol support to eww in a pluggable fashion.
[02:20:23] <lisp123> perhaps if I could use a better GUI interface with it, it might do the trick

[03:34:53] <rdrg109> Regarding my question: I looked at the implementation of next-line and found that this function calls line-move. The latter calls line-move-visual or line-move-1 given a set of met of conditions, one of them is not having a goal column. If there is a goal column, then line-move-1 is called ins tead of line-move-visual. Because I had wrongly set a goal column, line-move-visual wasn't being called,
[03:34:55] <rdrg109> once I deleted the goal column, line-move-visual was called instead so I solved my question.

[09:00:11] <aidalgol> Is it possible to shadow bindings for only a certain package?
[09:01:31] <aidalgol> I want to monkey-patch some packages to make them use my own versions of a couple of built-in functions, but not globally.
[09:04:08] <gnoo> if that package acts as a mode then yeah
[09:04:52] <aidalgol> It does not.  It provides a command, but not a mode.
[09:05:37] <gnoo> ohh, i misunderstood, you want that package to use different functions not different key bindings

[09:06:59] <gnoo> it should be, probably using something like defadvice or advice-add
[09:07:13] <aidalgol> OK, so what I'm *actually* trying to do is make some packages use `process-file' instead of `call-process' so that they work in TRAMP buffers, without having to modify the source for these packages every time I pull down an update.

[16:22:17] <muradm> hi, trying to use org babel source block with sql, in database i'm doing select on, there is a field with json, when i use this function https://mariadb.com/kb/en/json_detailed/ to show pretty printed json, resulting table is still draw one line with \n char sequences, i could not find a way to show pretty printed json in table, any idea where to look at?

[16:26:47] *** Quits: ignis (~ignisf@user/ignis) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[16:27:22] <rdrg109> What I mean "nicer way" is that by using ":results verbatim" the output would be shown as if it were executed in the command line.

[17:56:10] <fsbot> use-package is [0] a declaration macro that allows you to isolate package configuration in your user-init-file in a way that is performance-oriented and, well, just tidy. https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package
[17:56:10] <fsbot> [1] *ahem* or you could just M-x customize-group RET
[17:56:11] <ville> YoungFrog: sure. not even sure if i said the names of the relevant packages or not

[19:50:29] <zebrag> What is that? https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/bin/doom
[19:50:46] <vhallac> Hello. I have a question about pgtk build: normally, my WM maximizes frames depending on their class, or instance.
[19:50:47] <zebrag> First line is `#!/usr/bin/env sh`
[19:50:57] <vhallac> The old emacs gets maximized just fine
[19:51:08] <zebrag> Then it's elisp code?
[19:51:10] <vhallac> But when I switch to pgtk, the frame stays normal
[19:52:06] <vhallac> If I try to maximize using default-frame-alist, it gets maximized, but the size gets shrunk down to 80x25 (or so)
[19:52:46] <vhallac> I spent an hour so trying to get this to behave well, then ran back to my old emacs. Any ideas on what else I can try?

[20:08:52] <vhallac> MysteriousSilver: It is floating mode, so no manual tiling for me
[20:09:16] <vhallac> No gaps. Just plain old full screen windows. Well, most of the time.
[20:09:44] <MysteriousSilver> other applications are fine?
[20:09:56] <vhallac> Others are OK, and non-pgtk emacs is fine

[23:34:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> True. The comparison breaks down in that WIPO's nonsense was enabled by capitalism to start with... so it's a subset.

[23:36:58] <quotemstr> Huh
[23:36:59] <bpalmer> Sometimes I forget about the utopia that existed before capitalism, under agrarianism, tribalism, or feudalism.
[23:37:09] <bpalmer> What a golden age, before death.
[23:37:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bpalmer: There's never been a utopia.
[23:37:19] <quotemstr> So Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer's successor, is now beating Firefox on market shaer
[23:37:51] <quotemstr> Remember back when everyone thought FF eclipsing IE was some kind of permanent victory for interoperability and free software?
[23:37:56] <bpalmer> quotemstr: yes; i think that was true even before Edge shifted towards chromium
[23:38:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Something along the lines of capitalism was more or less required to follow from the ability to mass produce and export commerce.
[23:38:35] <bpalmer> quotemstr: note that all of the most popular browsers *are* built on free software, and the web is very interoperable across a huge range of OSes and devices.
[23:38:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Simply for additional efficiency.

[23:42:14] <bpalmer> the beautiful thing about laws is they're shared delusions.
[23:42:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ideally they'd be intended to minimze harm, rather than maximize it.
[23:42:42] <quotemstr> bpalmer: True. Edge itself is proprietary though, isn't it?
[23:42:56] <bpalmer> quotemstr: yep, like Chrome.
[23:43:01] <quotemstr> But sure, free software won. But so did IE's spiritual successor.
[23:43:12] <bpalmer> a little bit of special sauce on commons pasta.
[23:43:54] <bpalmer> quotemstr: a win-win situation; shouldn't everybody be happy?
[23:44:13] <bpalmer> Chrome is still more popular; I wonder if it should be considered firefox's spiritual successor?
[23:44:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There isn't going to be a successor of that sort.
[23:44:47] <technomancy[m]> Aurora_v_kosmose: was about to say that
[23:45:09] <technomancy[m]> there's no longer any such thing as an independent browser
[23:45:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's simply impractical to even try to implement half of the web spec from scratch anymore.
[23:45:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which in a reasonable world would lead to common consideration that the web is a rotting cesspit of a failed project and should be deprecated.
[23:45:53] <technomancy[m]> M-x eww is the spiritual successor to Firefox
