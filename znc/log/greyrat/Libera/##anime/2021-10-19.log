Unless all the existing useless chest mobs, it should actually keep up with you like a dog does, and it should float so it doesn't experience fall damage or other terrain issues.

[11:11:26] <Matt|home> yeah.. this reboot is a good one, but i truly hate that shit
[11:11:50] <Bco1981> wait... another superman reboot ?
[11:12:24] <Matt|home> nah, not really a reboot, i forget the exact details
[11:12:41] <Matt|home> basically DC said 'okay let's focus on new people taking up the superhero mantles' and one of them is clark kent's kid for example
[11:12:47] <Matt|home> and it's actually pretty good so far
[11:12:48] <Bco1981> since there is mention about a son, can't really be a reboot.

[12:27:52] <tsukkin> satin an anime that aired last season
[12:27:54] <Satin> a 2021 anime
[12:27:55] <Satin> wow
[12:28:04] <tsukkin> there have been a lot of good anime this year
[12:28:05] <Satin> yeah, I stopped watching anime in 2016 lol
[12:28:09] <Satin> cuz all of it was trash
[12:28:17] <tsukkin> you should give some newer stuff a shot
[12:28:17] <DunceCotus> well, you're wrong
[12:28:17] <Satin> since then i've only gone out of my way to watch NGE
[12:28:19] <Satin> etc
[12:28:29] <Satin> most new stuff almost always disappoints me and my pickiness and preference for serious shows
[12:28:38] <tsukkin> japan sinks 2020 
[12:28:42] <Satin> i tried watching that
[12:28:47] <Satin> egg show
[12:28:49] <Satin> last season
[12:28:54] <Satin> what its name
[12:29:03] <Satin> Wonder Egg yes.
[12:29:07] <tsukkin> oh yeah
[12:29:09] <tsukkin> that one um
[12:29:13] <Satin> It was so well animated and stuff
[12:29:16] <tsukkin> production issues
[12:29:19] <Satin> but a flop in terms of plot smh
[12:29:20] <Satin> that too
[12:29:31] <tsukkin> it was so close to being super gay too
[12:29:35] <tsukkin> what a disappointment 
[12:29:35] <Satin> I need to still finish it, 12 out of something episodes
[12:29:36] <Satin> yes
[12:29:37] <DunceCotus> eggo proxy
[12:29:41] <Satin> it had some real good stuff
[12:29:45] <Satin> Ergo Proxy is really good but old anime

[12:59:59] <tsukkin> why did you get shot with bullets 
[13:00:16] <Satin> carjackers or something, out to murder a doordasher i guess
[13:00:17] <ewong> wrong place.. wrong time
[13:00:20] <Satin> yeah
[13:00:31] <Satin> well they didn't know i was a doordasher necessarily
[13:00:37] <tsukkin> scary 
[13:00:51] <Satin> they just baited me out of the car, and i thought it was a tire or something
[13:01:01] <Satin> it was like 8 pm in the winter
[13:01:12] <Satin> turn around to look at the tire, and my arms/neck grabbed from behind
[13:01:33] <Satin> i wrung the guy's hands off me, shrieking, spun over to my car door, got inside, instantly calling my parent and stuff
[13:01:54] <tsukkin> this is why going outside is bad and should never be attempted 
[13:01:56] <Satin> but i didn't realize they had a gun as well, and then shortly after heard gunshots and the burning sensation of bullets :^)
[13:02:30] <Satin> i was dying, adrenaline in the moment, in the dark, i was like "it's over" but apparently it wasn't, even after i went unconscious
[13:02:56] <Satin> police came over after being told there was a shooting, EMS and all of that, and TL;DR surgeon doctor told my dad that had i been 5m late to the operating theater
[13:03:14] <Satin> i'd have passed away from internal injuries/all the bloodloss over my car's seats :^)
[13:03:27] <Satin> i'm fine physically even after taking in 5 bullets and getting lucky
[13:03:29] <tsukkin> did they take your car too
[13:03:32] <Satin> PTSD tho
[13:03:37] <Satin> no, i got in the car so
[13:03:51] <tsukkin> what why bother shooting you then
[13:03:52] <Satin> shot at me, all over the dashboard and all of that, damaging the rrear left window
[13:03:53] <tsukkin> dumb 
[13:03:56] <Satin> idk? murder?
[13:04:03] <Satin> spray the whole thing with bullets
[13:04:06] <Satin> then run away
[13:04:18] <ewong> what exactly is a doordasher?
[13:04:24] <tsukkin> just sounds like a good way to get yourself in more trouble than worth

[13:06:48] <Satin> financial reasons or just haven't found good people?

[13:06:54] <hassoon> ewong: being active irl is what you need..doesn't matter if you're not active her
[13:07:16] <tsukkin> just logistically seems like more effort than worth 
[13:08:04] <Satin> i see i see, I highly suggest trying, but everyone has different circumstances, hope it works out either ways.

[19:21:42] <MootPoot> seems like for the most part, ideal PLA temp is 220 for nozzle, 60 for bed, max fan, and 50-60mm/s
[19:22:34] <Guests-419> MootPoot you are a 3d printer, yes?
[19:22:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, ouch
[19:22:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. 230C is probably far too high
[19:23:20] <MootPoot> it worked far down low, as soon as it got to the hair it exploded
[19:23:44] <Sadale> MootPoot, and yes. 100mm/s is a bit too high. Faster nozzle movement means that it's easier to knock down the model. So slow down for a bit.

[20:47:53] <mexen> Oh yeah? Like what?
[20:49:42] <MootPoot> for me, its just integrated android, autoHDR ( yes I have a displayhdr600 monitor) , direct storage, snapgroups / snaplayouts ( it already exists in win10 as a add on called powertoys, but its finicky ) , and supposedly better virtual desktops
[20:49:55] <MootPoot> the UI changes and MS teams integration I dont care for
