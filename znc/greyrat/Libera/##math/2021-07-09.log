[00:01:44] <exilepilot> Currently reading James Stewart's Calculus - Should I stop after single variable then go into linear algebra or finish the whole book? After some proof writing will I be equipped for real analysis or should I do some more rigorous calculus first?
[00:03:45] <riv> stop after single variable
[00:03:58] <riv> unless you do physics
[00:04:01] <riv> then multivariable is useful
[00:04:04] <laurus> riv: I figured it out (I think), are you interested in my conclusion?
[00:04:12] <riv> laurus, yes I am
[00:04:15] <laurus> riv: Cool
[00:05:15] <Imk0tter> i invented a square root calculator/computer
[00:06:00] <Imk0tter> then i discovered this formula x^(2^-1)
[00:06:31] <exilepilot> riv: do you think I should go straight into linear algebra after?
[00:06:42] <laurus> riv: γ is not the identity transformation. We know a basis J exists such that [γ]_A^J becomes the change of basis matrix, i.e. [γ]_A^J = [[γu_1]_J, ..., [γu_n]_J] = [[u_1]_J, ..., [u_n]_J]. Since always [γu_1]_J = [γ]_A^J [u_1]_A, in this case, [γ]_A^J = [I]_A^J and thus [γ]_A^J [u_1]_A = [u_1]_J. But for other bases K, [γ]_A^K != [I]_A^K.
[00:06:49] <riv> yes exilepilot , linear algebra is the most important thing
[00:07:18] <riv> laurus, ah I see!

[00:07:31] <laurus> In summary, although there is a single basis for which a matrix representation of γ is the change of basis matrix, this does not hold for other bases.

[00:10:33] <Imk0tter> my sqrt computer uses water and gravity
[00:10:36] <laurus> In general we had that T := γ^{-1} S γ and S are similar transformations. The fact that we can write [T]_A = [γ]_A^J [S]_J [γ]_J^A = [I]_A^J [S]_J [I]_J^A for this particular basis J does not say anything further about the relationship of T and S
[00:11:20] *** Joins: jinsun_ (~jinsun_@user/jinsun)
[00:11:35] <laurus> It simply says that the matrices [T]_A and [S]_J are similar matrices

[00:12:38] <riv> yes that makes sense to me!
[00:12:46] <riv> similar is a good term, I should have thought of it earlier
[00:12:57] <laurus> (I should add that for other bases K, we still have that [T]_A is similar to [S]_K, and thus the "I" aspect of the particular basis J is really irrelevant)
[00:13:46] *** Joins: blackfield (~blackfiel@85.255.4.218)

[00:15:04] <laurus> And if γ is the identity transformation, for _any_ bases its matrix representation is a change of basis matrix, but if γ is not the identity transformation, it can only be the change of basis matrix for a single other "to" basis
[00:15:06] <riv> oh okay
[00:15:10] <riv> I think this gets to the heart of it
[00:15:29] <riv> you have linear transforms (without respect to any basis) and then y ou have matrix representations of them wrt. basis
[00:15:59] *** Joins: jinsun_ (~jinsun_@user/jinsun)

[00:16:08] <laurus> Right. My original question came from the fact that if you take an arbitrary invertible matrix, it represents a change of basis matrix for particular bases.
[00:16:27] <laurus> But that doesn't mean it is the identity transform, it only acts as an identity transform for that specific set of bases.
[00:16:31] <riv> aha
[00:16:41] <laurus> It's weird to me that I have never seen this in any linear algebra book

[03:15:49] <aruns> This is Sigma notation jmorris
[03:16:16] <buster> so i'm guessing. but i think your vector field looks like s:R^2->R^2, (x,y) |-> (1,5). and the vector field with all the vectors reversed is (x,y) |-> (-1,-5).
[03:17:59] <buster> if you take the gradient v_2/v_1 of all those vectors (though i have no idea why you would) you get 5 in both cases
[03:20:30] <tusko> buster, well consider y = 5x + c which is a solution to dy/dx = 5.
[03:20:55] <tusko> All the vectors in that field are going to have a slope of 5, we just move around the space depending on our initial conditions.

[04:29:19] <Guest594> if I flip a fair coin 2 times in a row and both come up heads then I ask what is probability of the third flip being heads?

[04:29:23] <Guest594> how is that not a paradox
[04:30:02] <Guest594> if I practically just want to know the probability that the next coin flip (which happens to be third one) will be heads, why wouldn't I take into account the previous 2 flips being heads and view it as 3 heads in a row

[04:31:38] <Fangs> buster: was it that you didnt realize the group mult in the wreath product  was different than in the direct product?
[04:32:34] <buster> i think that would be a fair assessment.
[04:32:50] <Fangs> Guest594: the probability of a (fair) coin to be heads 3x in a row is given by (1/2)^3 as you said
[04:32:53] <buster> whatever idea i had of the wreath product, i daresay it wasn't very coherent.
[04:33:13] <Fangs> Guest594: but there's this thing called "probabiliy of ____ given ____"
[04:33:38] *** Quits: dhs (~dhscholb@user/dhscholb) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:33:42] <Fangs> in this case, you'd look at the probability of getting another head, given that the previous two flips are heads
[04:34:25] <Guest594> Fangs: ok so how do I answer to a practical person that doesn't care about definitions? I've heard a lot of people answer this not as (1/2)^3 but as 0.5 because "probability is blind" or "each trial is independent"
[04:34:36] <Guest594> aren't both valid answers?
[04:35:06] <Guest594> I mean, just because I could look up what the previous 2 trials were if I wanted to, how does that influence the next trial?
[04:35:15] <Fangs> once you've flipped two heads in a row, you can't change the past
[04:35:30] <Fangs> Guest594: with discrete probability space like this you can just enumerate all the posibilities
[04:35:39] <Fangs> (1/2)^3 has to take into acount things like TTT or TTH, etc
[04:35:59] <Guest594> Fangs: so why don't gamblers use this to make millions of dollars then?
[04:36:03] <Fangs> but because in "history" we have HH_, with the third to be decided, stuff like TTT has to be discarded
[04:36:05] <Guest594> why dont they just record the roulette wheel
[04:36:10] <buster> you might say the coin is "forgetful", or "has no memory". it doesn't know about the previous two trials. so it's incorrect to take the history of previous trials (throws) into account. they have no influence.
[04:36:13] <Guest594> and calculate the 'true' probability given all past information
[04:36:50] <Fangs> you dont need to know all the past information if each flip is "independent of history"
[04:37:04] <Guest594> buster: yeah but then youre discarding information and theyre equivalent formulations of same question whether or not you take into account past or not?
[04:38:50] <Guest594> Fangs: ok so if a coin was flipped 3 times heads and you actually had to make a real decision like bet your house on whether next flip was heads, youre saying youd pick heads just as equal as tails because of something vague like 'probability is blind'?
[04:38:53] <buster> yes. on the one hand, the probability that you get a head next throw is 0.5. on the other hand, taking into account the history, the probability that you get a head next throw _given the history_ is 0.5 (no matter what that history was).
[04:39:27] <Guest594> personally if I were in that situation and knew the last 3 were heads I'd bet tails. you'd have to be an idiot to bet heads and bet on a 4th heads in a row if consequences actually cost you something
[04:40:18] <Guest594> even if 'in the long term' or 'on the average' it were true that they'd be equal
[04:40:47] <buster> the chances would be equal in the shortest possible term (for the next throw), too.
[04:41:25] <Fangs> Guest594: you dont think the coin is loaded?
[04:41:28] <Guest594> buster not if you consider the entire space of HHHH, HHHT, HTHT, etc. very few would come up HHHH lol

[06:22:51] <PlanckWalk> There's probably some modification of V that will work, depending upon alpha
[06:23:24] <rex> ok maybe we could start with the basics: Before this course if I encountered a system of diffeqs the only question was how to solve it; now apparently solutions don't matter, instead one looks at it as a ℝ^n function
[06:23:38] <PlanckWalk> Oh hmm, I guess not.
[06:24:08] <rex> Could you explain me what's the deal with that?
[06:24:15] <PlanckWalk> Nah, no V is going to work there.
[06:24:25] <PlanckWalk> You'll need different tools :)
[06:24:57] <PlanckWalk> Dynamical systems techniques are often applied where there's no closed form solution.
[06:25:34] <PlanckWalk> The idea is to be able to classify behaviour just from the equations, without knowing the exact solution
[06:25:54] <PlanckWalk> So at least you can salvage something
[06:26:00] <rex> ok so the solution the the diffeq system is not computable like roots of 5-th order polynoms? Or it is not feasible for other reasons like time e.g.?
[06:26:13] <PlanckWalk> Like roots of 5-order polynomials
[06:26:34] <rex> ok so what do the stationary points give me?
[06:26:42] <PlanckWalk> As in there is no formula in terms of some basic set of functions that satisfies the equation.
[06:27:03] <rex> I see
[06:27:52] <PlanckWalk> Stationary points often correspond to physically meaningful things (when applied to other fields)
[06:28:32] <PlanckWalk> If they're stable, they correspond with equilibrium states
[06:28:55] <PlanckWalk> If not, they usually correspond to points of interest on boundaries between different behaviours.
[06:29:07] <rex> like bifurcation points?
[06:29:14] <PlanckWalk> Yes, among other things
[06:29:54] <rex> ok is there some bridge between solutions and stationary points?
[06:29:58] <PlanckWalk> One question of interest is what happens when you slowly change some parameter of the system
[06:30:10] <rex> In this case the α?
[06:30:19] <PlanckWalk> Do the equilibria just move a little, jump, or maybe disappear entirely?

[07:45:23] <rex> x' = (1 - ax - y) x, y' = (c - by - x)y, a,b,c > 0; show that for every pair (x_0, y_0) ∈ R^+_0 × ℝ^+_0 there exists a unique solution (x,y) with x(0) = x_0, y(0) = y_0 and x,y everywhere non-negative
[07:45:32] <loopspace> Fangs: There can be more than one way. E.g. just did an exercise that had me find (both) extensions of Z_3 by V
[07:45:59] <Fangs> loopspace: whats the two extension you find?
[07:46:15] <loopspace> A_4 and Z_2xZ_6
[07:46:31] <Fangs> loopspace: left is semidirect product right is central extension
[07:46:40] <Fangs> again: central extension would give you an abelian group
[07:46:49] <rex> I'm guessing that for the non-negative part something like we did yesterday might work
[07:47:02] <rex> But I have no clue how to show uniqueness
[07:47:17] <Fangs> (not saying there's only one semidirect product, just that that's the only method that gives you non-abelian group)
[07:47:40] <loopspace> Fangs: yeah, sometimes you have to go further, wreath products, etc
[07:48:01] <loopspace> Fangs: perhaps you might enjoy this passage (I did) https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/oFLMx0fA/image.png
[07:48:03] <Fangs> can you get wreath products via SES?
[07:49:39] <Fangs> loopspace: are you reading D&F?
[07:50:36] <loopspace> Fangs: I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Ask my again down the road (assuming I retain my interest in group cohomology). Right now reading MacLane (currently digressing into Rotman)
[07:53:32] <Fangs> fair

If in a population, y(t) the death rate is proportional to the population, and the birth rate is proportional to chance encounters of meeting mates for reproduction, what will the model be? Without solving, find out what will eventually happen to a small initial population. To a larger one. Then solve the model.

[15:48:50] <rubiksdream> if D is the open unit disk, and f is a mobius transformation mapping D conformally onto the upper half plane (so its a conformal bijection), is it necessarily true that f maps any open unit disk contained in D to an open unit disk in the upper half plane?
[15:48:53] <tolarz> I am not sure why you write "-Ay"
[15:48:58] <tolarz> y is the death rate?
[15:48:59] <tolarz> quarterback:
[15:49:32] <tolarz> if y is the population, then -y' is the death rate, i guess.
[15:49:50] <quarterback> tolarz, The problem states that death rate is proportional to population y(t). Death rate is negative.
[15:49:58] <tolarz> so i would first say: -y' ~ Ay
[15:50:20] <rubiksdream> intuitively I think it has to be, because the boundary of an open unit disk contained in D would have to be mapped to a circle in the upper half plane, and then by conformality any interior point would have to be mapped to an interior point of the circle in the upper half plane, since the alternative would mean that the image of the closed disk in the unit disk would be unbounded
[15:50:25] <quarterback> tolarz, It says proportional to death rate, not equal. if its equal then it is y or else Ay
[15:51:30] <quarterback> tolarz, I wrote y' = birth rate-death rate.
[15:52:23] <tolarz> Assume a population has a constant proportion of females and males
[15:52:28] <tolarz> Let that be C
[15:52:32] <tolarz> What is the chance of mating?
[15:52:34] <tolarz> idk
[15:52:44] <tolarz> y*C*y*(1-C)?
[15:53:03] <tolarz> so i would say: y' ~ y*C*y*(1-C)
[15:53:05] <tolarz> in total:
[15:53:15] <tolarz> y' = -Ay * y^2*C*(1-C)
[15:54:05] <rubiksdream> I guess I would also need to add that the single point p \in C where f(p) = infinity does not lie in the open unit disk
[15:54:41] <tolarz> quarterback: i don't understand why you have addition in your model
[15:55:26] <quarterback> tolarz, Population increases by birth rate , decreases by death rate. It is not addition. I have subtraction.
[15:57:29] <quarterback> tolarz, Birth and death are not related so they have to be added not multiplied. They are independent of each other.

[16:04:16] <quarterback> Arcorann,  its because I wrote total numbers not probablilits. It is not wrong entirely. lets say that a particulate mate is male and the probability of that is C , the other mate has to be 1-C The chance of mating is y*C*y(1-C)
[16:04:27] <quarterback> probabilities*
[16:04:51] <PlanckWalk> Probabilities don't combine that way

[20:29:19] <rubiksdream> granted both of these issues can be filled in by a motivated reader
[20:29:47] <rubiksdream> (that is X^{infinity} is a direct limit of k-skeletons)
[20:30:25] <rubiksdream> actually he does formally explain some of this stuff, but its in the appendix, and the proofs in the appendix themselves require a lot of filling in for readers who care about every exact detail
[20:30:56] <loopspace> Hatcher is useful. I prefer Rotman's proofs in many cases, using Hatcher for additional geometric perspective

[23:09:09] <dextaa> int-e so no order restriction? then it's not axiomatizable by Lowenheim-Skolem
[23:09:16] <int-e> riv: informally, a class is what you get from set builder notation without restriction. So the collection of all sets, for example, is a class. Formally, you'd turn it into a predicate (a formula with a free variable).
[23:09:57] <int-e> No, not Löwenheim-Skolem, that would require an infinite model, and all the models you're given are finite.
[23:10:31] <Z-module> the collection of all 1-element groups is a proper class, even
[23:11:03] <dextaa> isn't LS: If the axiomsystem has arbitrarily large finite models also an infinite one?
[23:11:18] <int-e> Z-module: but yawn, that's essentially the same as the class of all sets.

[23:14:24] <int-e> dextaa: Not as I learned it, but... "The proof of the upward part of the theorem also shows that a theory with arbitrarily large finite models must have an infinite model; sometimes this is considered to be part of the theorem."
