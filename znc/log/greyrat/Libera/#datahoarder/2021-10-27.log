[21:56:38] <skye0_mobile> Question - are NFTs a solution or another problem of companies and rich people using art for profit?
[21:58:50] <skye0_mobile> according to this cryptocurrency website, it's the former: https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/110591/copyright-infringement-and-nfts-how-artists-can-protect-themselves
[21:59:08] <evilgohan2> NFTs are garbage.
[21:59:12] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: NFTs are 100% a sacm
[21:59:13] <joepie91> scam*
[21:59:26] <evilgohan2> They serve no meaningful purpose.
[21:59:30] <joepie91> basically art world money laundering + MLM-y cryptocurrency investment scams = NFTs
[21:59:48] <evilgohan2> Don't forget speculatory crap
[21:59:56] <skye0_mobile> i'd say get rid of copyright law altogether and anyone who's hurt by the absence of copyright law (particularly the marginalized) should be aided with wealth redistribution or something
[21:59:59] <joepie91> that's covered in the latter :p
[22:00:03] <evilgohan2> Fair
[22:00:10] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: also NFTs have literally nothing to do with copyright law
[22:00:16] <joepie91> despite attempts by proponents to make people associate one with the other
[22:00:32] <skye0_mobile> what do you know about how they started besides it being another crypto thing
[22:00:32] <evilgohan2> Anyone claiming NFTs can help with copyright is attempting to peddle BS
[22:00:54] <joepie91> skye0_mobile: it's just another techbro project
[22:00:58] <skye0_mobile> of course i know why crypto got big in the first place (libertarians)
[22:02:29] <evilgohan2> skye0_mobile, the best way I can describe NFTs...
[22:02:33] <evilgohan2> and why they're a scam
[22:02:43] <evilgohan2> By any chance, do you remember the Star Registry?
[22:03:16] <skye0_mobile> idk about the star registry
[22:03:28] <evilgohan2> Okay. I remember this being a thing when I was a kid.
[22:03:42] <evilgohan2> the Star Registry was this organizatino that sold the rights to name stars.
[22:04:05] <evilgohan2> They claimed they were the official international star registry and persons could buy official naming rights.
[22:04:07] <unfinity> ・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\_O<​ QUACK​!

[22:04:10] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 2.643 seconds! You have made friends with 195 ducks in #datahoarder.
[22:04:51] <evilgohan2> They would then allegedly write the name of the star in a book, and send someone a certificate.
[22:04:54] <skye0_mobile> ah
[22:05:13] <evilgohan2> It was 100% bs. But hey, you bought it so that star is totally yours and yours alone, and no one else can claim that star
[22:05:21] <evilgohan2> No, you can't touch it. You'll likely never see it.
[22:05:24] <evilgohan2> But it's yours!
[22:05:27] <evilgohan2> Totally!
[22:05:28] <evilgohan2> Trust me!
[22:05:38] <evilgohan2> That's NFTs.
[22:05:56] <skye0_mobile> ok, so another manifestation of copyright, got it
[22:05:56] <evilgohan2> Completely unironically.

[22:10:54] <yano> it takes a while to run
[22:11:01] <evilgohan2> I bet. 86 torrents? Yikes.
[22:11:02] <yano> but i'm mirroring 10.11 and 11.1
[22:11:12] <yano> so that's like 160 torrents just of Debian
