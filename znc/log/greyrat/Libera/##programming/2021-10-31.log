[00:10:21] <auk> anyone know much about arithmetic coding (compression)?
[00:11:32] <auk> if length of original msg is required to decompress... do most practical schemes embed that info in the compressed form? or perhaps AE tends to only be practically employed when length is predictable?
[00:13:35] <auk> or is length(original) even mathematically required? or is that just an artifact of some implementations
[00:14:24] <Rounin> Hm... I mean, nearly any file format like that is going to have some metadata, so if the length is needed, there's an obvious place to specify it
[00:14:38] <Rounin> But that's all I could tell you about it
[00:15:33] <Rounin> A compressed file format might also need a place to store file names, whether a file or block was compressed at all, what algorithm was chosen, a dictionary, etc.

[00:18:34] <auk> aye
[00:18:37] <auk> i know very little about arithmetic coding as an algorithm, only started reading about it the other day
[00:19:05] <flakland> never heard of it
[00:19:12] <auk> apparently it gets really good compression ratios? but it doesnt seem to be used as often as other schemes for practical purposes
[00:20:02] <Rounin> It might be because some implementation details of it were patended for a while... Some implementations used the similar range encoding instead, and now we have the also similar Asymmetric Numeral Systems, and Finite State Entropy, used by ZStandard

[00:20:31] <auk> ^ flakland, if interested
[00:20:44] <auk> Rounin, yeah i think zstandard uses AE right?
[00:21:08] <auk> oh, or ANS... is basically a subset of AE? iiuc
[00:21:49] <flakland> lol floats
[00:21:51] <flakland> whyyyyy
[00:22:16] <Rounin> auk: As far as I understand, it uses a special case of ANS called Finite State Entropy, which is simpler to code, but offers similar compression ratios
[00:22:25] <auk> the particular context i'm looking at is, compression of (very) short strings -- right now i have a working version using Unishox, but i'm hoping for an even better compression ratio
[00:22:30] <Rounin> Probably for speed etc.
[00:22:55] <flakland> integers faster than floats
[00:23:37] <auk> flakland, idk if it requires floats for implementation but mathematically the concept of AE is that all data is represented as a # between 0 and 1
[00:23:42] <auk> Rounin, ah i see
[00:24:00] <Rounin> auk: There's also the issue of how you eliminate redundancy, right... Like, if you have the sequence "01101001100101101001011001101001", both the symbols 0 and 1 are equally likely, and "01101001" and "10010110" are also equally likely, yet there is redundancy in the sequence

[00:28:32] <auk> specifically, i'm thinking of using AE to compress strings composed only of chars [a-z0-9] and space, comma, period
[00:28:39] <Rounin> Unfortunately not, auk... Interesting question, though... After all, how much redundancy is there going to be in a short piece of text?
[00:29:03] <auk> Rounin, quite a lot of redundancy when you consider letter distribution :) 
[00:29:35] <auk> even more redundancy if you embed language-specific probabilities in the frequency table :))
[00:29:57] <Rounin> Yes... And only 39 different letters... That should be quite compressible
[00:30:38] <Rounin> Even disregarding the probability of each one, it would be a bit more than 5 bits per input byte
[00:30:43] <auk> yeah, from what i've read it seems a perfect match for AE. 
[00:30:58] <auk> Rounin, yep, 5 bits max, and i'm hoping to get down to ~3 bits ag

So, I've learned to use the debugger properly and at least prettified the code lines and made breakpoints work. However, functions and variables renamed to one letter with no map is the problem. https://i.imgur.com/cADiu2i.png It's too much effort to debug this.

[03:36:36] <juliaEnv> a debugger sets a breakpoint on what you are interested in and skips the rest
[03:36:44] <juliaEnv> to set that breakpoint in a minified JS that has everything on one long line, you need to click the "{ }" icon. It's a pretty print function in FF JS debugger.

[05:30:18] <juliaEnv> well, to give an example, you can get an Azure certificate and some initial Azure experience with it, and work in a company as Azure Architect. You get paid what is an Azure Architect market rate. It doesn't matter if you can code in 10 languages, or if you can write unit tests / integration tests, or if you can service the hardware and administer the network.
[05:31:18] <flakland> lol that's a real job ititle?
[05:31:22] <juliaEnv> In other words, you get paid the market rate for doing X (X is one thing) disregarding the fact that you can do nearly everything
[05:31:22] <flakland> sounds made up

[05:36:32] <juliaEnv> market rates are what you get paid for performing a specific function demanded by the market
[05:36:56] <flakland> market rates are what you get paid.
[05:37:29] <juliaEnv> and you get paid the same amount when you perform a trivial function (i.e. when you do testing) as if you performed a hardcode super challenging function (i.e. when you do software development)
[05:37:56] <juliaEnv> * hardcore super challenging function
[05:37:56] <flakland> if you want to itemize everything its going to be a huge headache
[05:38:30] <flakland> then you have to define rates by some kind of measurable metric
[05:38:31] <juliaEnv> well, you can be a tester making the exact same money as a developer
[05:38:46] <flakland> like 30$ per 10 lines of code, or some BS
[05:39:05] <juliaEnv> market rates are hourly rates. They are what customers are willing to pay to get that function performed.

[13:07:04] <bugweiser> hi all, i've been struggling for some days to come up with methods to help me decide in a constant (representing a weighting).  It is about reducing a 24bit rgb color to a single bit boolean which decides to use either a white or black color font. 
[13:08:02] *** Joins: anemic-spaghetti (~tem@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9)
[13:08:06] <bugweiser> perhaps I should just filter the colors where the constants disagree, then decide myself if it should have white or black font color  (perhaps also have a value to indicate i don't care or feel rather strongly about that particular choice per color). And then just see which constant has the highest score ?

[13:11:08] <Decker> hmm it's harder to find than I thought - there's some fixed scalars you can multiple R,G,B to and sum to get a threshold of 'black' or 'white'  because the intensity of each color is different

[13:13:50] <bugweiser>     ta=(n&0xf0f0f0) *0x20a05 &0x8000000; // 0.294 0.588 0.118

[13:14:12] <bugweiser> gedamo, the thing is.. this is REALLY simple and does a heck of a lot more work than you might initially expect :)
[13:14:24] <bugweiser> the clue is the shared factor of 17 (for up/down scale).
[13:14:50] <bugweiser> n= 24bit rgb (big endian)
[13:15:37] <bugweiser> the final &0x800000 already extracts the answer (it is the most significant bit of the resulting exact bytesized answer hidden in there :) )
[13:15:58] <bugweiser> the conversion then is completely done with the initial mask and multiplication. 
[13:16:03] <bugweiser> I know, there is no gamma.
[13:16:21] <bugweiser> but it is also clearly better than r+g+b/3  (and as you can see, cheaper to do..)
[13:16:28] <bugweiser> I've never seen this online

[13:51:28] <bugweiser> extern, thanks for the good hint! I've had varying results over the years :)   Still I figured no harm in asking (whith the core question being, how do I decide)

[13:55:06] <bugweiser> the slider.. that would mean i'd mask off more bits of the bytesized (really, range 0-255 exact) value and do a greater/smaller comparison.

[13:55:30] <bugweiser> that would lead to 2 questions/problems.. both the constant, and the comparison. 
[13:55:50] <bugweiser> extern, thanks for the compliment !!! really!
[13:55:56] <Decker> well it's more the threshold for the output

[13:56:09] <Decker> rather than a filter on the input

[14:00:32] <bugweiser> ok, what this does is the following: reduce 24bit (16*16*16 color cube) to 12 bit (16*16*16 color cube. This is needed to make a full radix room, such that the rule of filling one is held: (radix-1)*(radix+1)   thus this becomes max val of 15 (4 bits) * 17 = 255 :)

If yes, you need to account/decide which value is the one you emit in your combined output.
[16:27:16] <bugweiser> reusing something you have seems sane..  (the json-glib)

[18:43:41] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Your lengthy comments last night about the value of hyper-specialization have a time and place where they are true, specifically at a certain larger market size and accompanying organizational sizes, and while the specific target of the hyperspecialization remains a popular approach.  But this exposes an individual fragility of plummeting in value as soon as the target of the 
[18:43:47] <InPhase> hyperspecialization goes out of fashion.  It also ends up limiting the problems one can work on, as there are many things that require tapping broader expertise to make forward progress.  If you attempt to solve all interdisciplinary and cross-functional problems by simply communication between individuals rather than broad competence within individuals, the weaknesses of communication will slow 
[18:43:53] <InPhase> productivity and reduce quality.

[18:52:23] <juliaEnv> I have witnessed 2projects fail in big companies over the last month due to vague (not 100% specific) requirements that caused an incorrect deadline estimation and rejection by the stakeholder who expected something very specific, but the company interpreted from the high-level requirements that any solution is OK as long as the high-level requirements are met.
[18:52:26] <InPhase> juliaEnv: To predict a software project cost and complexity you have to be able to anticipate aspects across its full problem domain, while simultaneously understanding the details of implementation, dependencies, hardware, and architecture.
[18:52:46] <InPhase> juliaEnv: This requires some heavily cross-functional skills.
[18:53:11] <InPhase> juliaEnv: In fact, no one is actually able to MAKE requirements unless they have skills across all of these things.

[19:17:01] <InPhase> juliaEnv: To the contrary, under my guidance we recognize that waterfall models will cause failure, so we have staged requirements with updates of these on a managed feedback cycle, and then cross-functional oversight of which updates will comply with the timeline.
[19:17:14] <juliaEnv> when those techniques are rigorously followed, we get specific requirements and we also get the stakeholders to be responsible for approving the requirements before we start

[20:25:13] <juliaEnv> there is an evidence to the contrary, apotheon. There is not a lack of evidence.
[20:25:41] <pulse> If software methodologies actually worked, software would be delivered on time, and would have no bugs

[20:25:59] <apotheon> You're arguing from a lack of evidence in trademarked, rigid methodologies for the existence of some requirement.
[20:26:02] <juliaEnv> Agile methodologies don't have a fixed deadline, so software is actually delivered, pulse
[20:26:20] <juliaEnv> when speaking of "on time" you're speaking of plan-based metdhologies, i.e. waterfall

[22:00:51] <juliaEnv> InPhase in Kanban, lead and cycle time define the average time it takes to complete a task. Team velocity defines how many tasks a team can deliver in a given period of time, for example in a week or iteration. But ultimately, what's deliver in an iteration is deliver. An iteration is a timebox. Timebox is different from a deadline in plan-based approaches. The deadline referred to at kanbantool.com is a timebox, not a 
[22:00:51] <juliaEnv> deadline that is in plan-based approaches. In other words, you don't tell the customer his project will be done in 3 months. You involve the customer and tell him releases will be every 1 week (as an example). The 1 week is not a deadline!!! The 1 week is a timebox.

So, people think they do engineering when they have undefined iterative waterfall processes instead and hence it crumbles 83.9% of the time https://www.opendoorerp.com/the-standish-group-report-83-9-of-it-projects-par

[22:09:52] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Then you should talk to customers more.  They have budget constraints and budget-driven deadlines.
[22:09:52] <juliaEnv> in plan-based approaches, there is a fixed time, fixed cost, fixed scope
[22:10:12] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Sometimes even people are literally dying, and delays result in more death.
[22:10:45] <juliaEnv> you have failed to appreciate these two approaches and their differences and you have failed to distinguish properly between the two. You keep mixing it all the time which is also happening in most IT shops since they do an iterative waterfall and call it Agile, so their people don't even know what Agile really looks like
[22:11:32] <juliaEnv> In Scrum, a customer is a Product Owner and attends daily standups, meaning we talk daily every morning. 
[22:12:05] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Look up the concept of burn down charts, which are so named because of the term burn rate in financing, which sets the hard deadlines.
[22:12:21] <juliaEnv> at any time, the customer can say he is happy with the latest realease enough to stop the development for now
[22:12:39] <juliaEnv> that's because his cruicial prioritized requirements have been implemented
[22:12:59] <juliaEnv> it's up to the customer to manage his budget and to add and prioritize requirements into the backlog
[22:13:14] <juliaEnv> if you only could understand the fundamentals of Scrum, for example.
[22:13:29] <juliaEnv> if you could only get hands-on experience with this, at least 1 year, for example
[22:13:34] <juliaEnv> it works
[22:14:19] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Do you know why I don't do Scrum?  Because it distracts with so much fluff that things don't get completed on time.  It doesn't work.  The failure rate is far higher than I can tolerate in my work.
[22:14:43] <juliaEnv> Scrum isn't deadline-driven so there is no such concept as completing things on time

[22:16:14] <[itchyjunk]> mspe, yes but github is probably good enough
[22:16:32] <juliaEnv> those failing projects are waterfall projects

[22:18:42] <juliaEnv> agile transformation is an attempt to transform a non-agile methodology into an agile methodology. It is not a study of running Scrum projects. It is a study of trying to change from plan-driven into Agile.

[22:24:35] <juliaEnv> apotheon the community Agile practitioners
[22:24:37] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Here is a chart showing that people who focus on Lean Software Development, rather than fads like Scrum variants of agile, actually have higher success rates:  https://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/success2013.html
[22:24:38] <bayaz> Title: 2013 IT Project Success Rates Survey Results 
[22:24:43] <apotheon> . . . so a methodology is not agile until it's popular.  Is that it?
[22:24:57] <juliaEnv> probably also some more places, who knows
[22:24:59] <InPhase> juliaEnv: For the record, Lean is, as it says on wikipedia, "lean software development is considered an agile software development method"
[22:25:09] <juliaEnv> recognized != popular
[22:25:43] <juliaEnv> recognized usually means there are scientific studies on it, and then it is shown beneficial in some way, and then it is adopted by the community due to its objective benefit
[22:26:01] <apotheon> You said "the community" has to "recognize" it.
[22:26:25] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Lean is focused on cutting out wasteful steps and optimizing approaches so that deadlines are met, in an agile manner.  This leads to higher success.
[22:26:30] <apotheon> It must, thus, be popularly understood as "agile" within the "community".
[22:26:36] <pyzozord> if you dig deep enough into any category/definition like this you'll find the line is bluring out
[22:26:38] <juliaEnv> so if you write a paper with a new Agile methodology and get it accepted into a specialist journal and then you get citations and you start to notice practitioners are using it, that would be a success

[22:28:16] <apotheon> In that case, according to the juliaEnv Standard Definition Of Agile, I don't give one tenth of a shit about Agile‚Ñ¢.  I care more about what works, what serves principles of good software development process, and so on.

[22:28:55] <apotheon> The JESDOA specification is pointless.

[22:30:15] <apotheon> The subject seems settled at this point.
[22:30:39] <juliaEnv> InPhase no, I have been more familiar with it than you. So, you refer a lean methodology now, but lean methodology is not the same as agile methodology. Again, you are mixing two concepts.

[22:31:59] <juliaEnv> n short, Lean methodology is a way of optimizing the people, resources, effort, and energy of your organization toward creating value for the customer.
[22:32:03] <juliaEnv> in short
[22:32:10] <InPhase> juliaEnv: I 100% agree with that statement I quoted.  It should be self-evident.
[22:32:24] <juliaEnv> Agile is a family of software development methodologies, as I've written a few times 
[22:32:52] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Defined by Agile Incorporated?
[22:33:23] <apotheon> InPhase: I think I managed to get juliaEnv to properly enough clarify the JESDOA specification of "Agile" that we can walk away knowing it's irrelevant.
[22:33:49] <juliaEnv> pay me $100/h for a consultation from now on :)
[22:33:58] <apotheon> InPhase: See above responses to me about publication and citations as the gold standard for Agile.
[22:34:15] <InPhase> juliaEnv: It is not a family, it is a generalized approach to software development in alignment with a set of principles in the Agile Manifesto, and more specified methods are agile when they comply with these.  There is NO authority creating in/out lists.  There is alignment or not with the principles.
[22:34:32] <apotheon> juliaEnv: I hope you get a lot of business from organizations that appreciate that thinking.  It'll make it easier for people like InPhase to compete.
[22:34:47] <InPhase> juliaEnv: If you think you have some authority which declares otherwise, recognize that it's not a recognized authority.  :)
[22:35:02] <juliaEnv> or go back to Software Engineering, 10th edition by Ian Sommerville, and this time start on page 43 software proceses because somehow you keep juggling different concepts together and not seeing they are process models
[22:35:15] <apotheon> . . . even if I think that hard deadlines with clear plans for completion requirements aren't very agile.
[22:35:29] <InPhase> Last time I went into that book it disagreed with you...
[22:36:24] <juliaEnv> seriously, read 43-72 to understand software processes and then you are more likely to understand Agile software development 72-88
[22:36:49] <apotheon> I once wrote a todo list manager with a process that was a little waterfall and a little agile, and it worked out extremely well.
[22:36:56] <juliaEnv> somehow, you have gaps in knowledge that don't let you see and understand from process models of approaches mentioned on pages 72-88 how to execute those methodologies in practice
[22:37:21] <apotheon> . . . but it was the kind of thing that doesn't really need rigorous agility in dev process, so . . . whatevs.

I've been doing software development long enough to watch these terms get created and morph in usage.  They get created 
[22:41:36] <juliaEnv> InPhase Sommerville has references there, so you should not miss them. 
[22:41:39] <InPhase> and morph because of changing recognitions of needs in the field, and an expert in this area should be attentive to these to be at the head of the game.

[23:09:14] <pyzozord> I should read some ancient gree philosophy

[23:10:08] <pyzozord> I have History of Western Philosophy by Russel, I tried few times to read it, but I haven't managed to go deeper than 50 pages :(
[23:11:14] <tomathy> how do i decide how to organise my program?
[23:11:45] <pyzozord> it's a bit like organising anything, your desk, your room, you name it
[23:11:45] <tomathy> when the problem is hard enough it is easy, but when the problem is quite simple, i get disorganised
[23:12:00] <pyzozord> The more you organize the better you get at it. 
[23:12:29] <pyzozord> that sounds more like a motivation/discipline problem
[23:13:28] <tomathy> i see it as more of an economics problem
[23:13:32] <tomathy> but you're right
[23:14:26] <tomathy> i have to make the problem more complicated in order to be motivated to organise it
[23:15:01] <pyzozord> also might be worth reevaluating why you want to organize it in the first place
[23:15:12] <pyzozord> maybe the small problem doesn't need organizing

[23:51:48] <tomathy> how comes changing a file in my computer can make an entire device work? that is bizarre
[23:51:50] <tomathy> but cool
[23:52:09] <kveroneau> tomathy, just like when people used to buy those older computers in the 70s and 80s that connected to your TV and booted right into a version of BASIC. :D
[23:52:37] <tomathy> i was born in the 90s
[23:52:42] <kveroneau> It made you want to program in BASIC.
[23:52:53] <tomathy> cool well maybe they need to return to that
[23:52:56] <kveroneau> Oh, I am sorry to hear that. :(  I was born in the 80s.
[23:52:59] <pyzozord> tomathy: many of those files aren't really files, kernel pretends they are files, but they are really make beliefe files that don't exist
[23:53:14] <pyzozord> it's just a kind of strange way to interface with the kernel
[23:53:29] <kveroneau> There are some Raspberry Pi projects to emulate those days using a Raspberry Pi and a modern television.
[23:53:32] <tomathy> what is the kernel called in windows?
[23:53:53] <pyzozord> window has "kernel" too afaik
[23:54:23] <tomathy> is it that massive thing with all those checkboxes etc

[23:55:55] <pyzozord> but you can interface with it like with linux kernel that lets you interact with it via pretend files as one of the ways of interacting with it
[23:56:47] <mspe> kveroneau: like my childhood's Amstrad CPC 464 with 64 KB of RAM and tape recorder as storage ^^
[23:57:14] <mspe> yup, made me program in BASIC
[23:57:32] <kveroneau> tomathy, I believe the kernel file is NTOSKNRL or something similarily named.
[23:58:26] <kveroneau> mspe, I started with an Apple ][+, and didn't even realize that the "]" prompt was BASIC at first, but once I realized, I was hooked on coding as a kid. :D
