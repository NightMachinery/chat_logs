[01:32:35] <pystardust> Lolsomeone[m]: 100% means one core being used 100%, ur device has multiple cores and if u use 40% from another then it adds up to 140%
[02:01:47] <Lolsomeone[m]> <pystardust> "Lol someone: 100% means one core..." <- Ohh thanks sir i thought that those percentage were for my whole cpu

[07:07:58] <usrbinenvchad[m]> dont use indian mirrors tbh. german mirrors like f4st.host are much faster

[11:44:51] <klimi[m]> guys, do you know how to detect cryptomining?
[11:45:31] <AryaK[m]> klimi[m]: minerblock on firefox?
[11:45:34] <AryaK[m]> and just htop
[11:45:35] <AryaK[m]> :)
[11:46:30] <klimi[m]> AryaK[m]: hm... idk if i want to run firefox on server to just detect cypto mining
[11:46:41] <klimi[m]> AryaK[m]: that won't show me anything will it?
[11:51:50] <AryaK[m]> <klimi[m]> "hm... idk if i want to run..." <- thats for browser based miners
[11:51:59] <AryaK[m]> <klimi[m]> "that won't show me anything will..." <- just check for sus processes
[11:52:12] <klimi[m]> AryaK[m]: well.... browser won't use 100% GPU so that's fine to ignore
[11:52:28] <klimi[m]> AryaK[m]: well yeah how could i detect gpu mining? i don't think it's possible
[11:52:49] <AryaK[m]> nvidia-smi?
[11:53:26] <klimi[m]> that will show PID of the process and how much memory it uses
[11:53:43] <klimi[m]> but since there will be training done on the cards, it will be normal for them to have high memory usage
[11:55:44] <klimi[m]> yeah... idk how i would go about that
