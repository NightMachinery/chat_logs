[07:12:28] <Abhi[m]> They just taxed it guys ! 
[07:12:28] <Abhi[m]> I assume they won’t ban but who knows really .
[07:18:47] <P-200[m]> They declared it as assets right? And rbi I also launching Indian crypto currency so maybe they will use that as a digital currency on moving forward
[07:18:53] <P-200[m]> Is*
[07:23:05] <Abhi[m]> You have to be so careful when speaking about this . It’s just insane
[07:24:42] <P-200[m]> Oh I'm sorry for jumping in out of nowhere and yeah I'll be careful
[07:25:23] <Abhi[m]> No I mean in unrelated to you
[07:25:48] <Abhi[m]> Just an unrelated message .
[07:26:19] <P-200[m]> Understood
[07:31:11] <ramram[m]> > <Abhi> They just taxed it guys ! 
[07:31:11] <ramram[m]> > I assume they won’t ban but who knows really .
[07:31:11] <ramram[m]> 30%
[07:32:39] <Abhi[m]> ramram[m]: It was foolish to believe it won’t be taxed ever
[07:34:10] <ramram[m]> Abhi[m]: what ? explain
[07:35:29] <Abhi[m]> Were you on the impression it wouldn’t ever be taxed ? People sure acting like that
[07:35:53] <Abhi[m]> It was expected. But yes 30% is huge
[07:36:35] <Abhi[m]> But now people will do long term investments . And that is good for the whole crypto thingy . 
[07:36:35] <Abhi[m]> My opinion doesn’t really matter so meh that
[07:40:29] <Abhi[m]> You can make a lot of money if you just look at the positive side at this point in time , (says the guy that generally shorts btc)

[07:54:12] <Abhi[m]> ramram[m]: The thing is . The less people know how to make money from this info the better .

[08:20:20] <Abhi[m]> Found this thing.  Is bitcoin an assent ? I don’t know !
[08:21:10] <Abhi[m]> It’s “treated “ as an asset . But is it really an asset ? I can treat anything like an asset . 
[08:21:10] <Abhi[m]> I am confused guys . Explain me please
[08:21:45] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: What made you think this is a bitcoin asset?
[08:22:03] <E-man[m]> * What made you think this is a bitcoin asset?
[08:22:03] <E-man[m]> Was there any specific reason?
[08:22:57] <Abhi[m]> I don’t think anything yet .
[08:23:12] <Abhi[m]> I am confused I am asking you all. Is btc and digital asset ?
[08:23:34] <Abhi[m]> Technically… it’s  i don’t know !
[08:23:41] <Abhi[m]> s/it’s//
[08:24:08] <Abhi[m]> s/and/an/
[08:25:36] <E-man[m]> Afaik any bitcoin/crypto asset that you "own" like in a pendrive or a file is nothing more than a pointer to the transaction that you did. So that you can prove that it was you who was responsible for that update in the block. Ultimately all "bitcoin" stays as the ledger in the blockchain.
[08:26:39] <Abhi[m]> I am asking . Is crypto an asset ?
[08:26:51] <E-man[m]> Asset in what sense?
[08:27:04] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: They taxing “digital asset “ as far as I know
[08:27:16] <Abhi[m]> But is cryptocurrency an asset ?
[08:27:47] <E-man[m]> I think they applied the law in a similar way to how it applies to stocks. So in a sense it is an investment asset.
[08:28:22] <E-man[m]> Where you are to pay taxes on the gains you made. I do not know about mining.
[08:28:38] <E-man[m]> * about mining and how it applies to being taxed.
[08:28:48] <Abhi[m]> But they never used the words crypto currency . 
[08:28:48] <Abhi[m]> It’s a currency technically speaking ! 
[08:28:48] <Abhi[m]> These news media said about cryptocurrency . 
[08:28:48] <Abhi[m]> The gov said nothing
[08:28:55] <Abhi[m]> As far as I can tell
[08:29:57] <E-man[m]> They wanted to cover as big an area as possible. So anything crypto related could be counted as taxable. In a couple years it may not be called cryptocurrency that should not prevent from taxes being filed is what they want.
[08:30:55] <E-man[m]> Anything that an audit can prove to have value if you sell it could be taxable. But I am not sure if it is applicable if you dont liquify it.
[08:31:02] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: This is what news media says
[08:31:12] <Abhi[m]> But have you heared what gov said?
[08:31:23] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: What if I have US dollars ?
[08:31:58] <Abhi[m]> Abhi[m]: How much tax is their ? Currency exchange tax is their I assume I don’t know
[08:32:56] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: Basically if you make a profit, and your investements net you a yearly profit to take you into a tax bracket then youd be liable for taxes.
[08:33:15] <E-man[m]> Cuz even for stocks the tax is on the profit you make
[08:33:28] <E-man[m]> So if you make profit by currency swapping the same rule would apply
[08:34:03] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: I don’t think ! That’s different tax as I think we pay currency exchange tax then
[08:36:10] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: I dont know about it, I have changed currency many times in airports and the value they charge maybe higher due to the up and down noise but  personally I have not experienced it. Also if you ever buy something through PayPal in another currency you'll see that it is a direct conversion rate plus the extra PayPal charges
[08:37:04] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: Yes then what about crypto currency !
[08:37:20] <Abhi[m]> It’s currency the name is currency
[08:37:41] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: I can make profit on US dollars also due to inflation in india . That’s not taxed heavily
[08:37:55] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: The tax is on the profit you make in crypto not just for having it. If your total net worth id less tha 2 lakhs even just from crypto you will not be taxed is what i understoof
[08:38:12] <Abhi[m]> Abhi[m]: This e-man
[08:38:35] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: Profit is always taxed.
[08:38:50] <E-man[m]> Because that is counted as income/returns
[08:38:55] <Abhi[m]> NO ONE OFFICALY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT CRYPTO CURRENCY EXCEPT THE NEWS MEDIA AS FAR AS I CAN TELL I MAY BE WRONG
[08:39:08] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: But that’s lower then 30% ;)
[08:39:49] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: Yes the rules of taxes are not finalized how much of a cut will it be for crypto also i would assume would be assigned a similar amount
[08:40:22] <Abhi[m]> But it’s a currency technically so we should pay whatever the currency exchange tax is .
[08:40:58] <Abhi[m]> As I can tell
[08:41:10] <Abhi[m]> As no one said about crypto currency offically
[08:41:27] <Abhi[m]> Digital asset can be . Digital land or things like this who knows ? Lol
[08:42:13] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: No, the point is profit. If you exchange some rupees to dollars say a lakh. And suddenly dollar is worth around 100x more. You'd be charged for the profit of 100x when you liquify the assets. This is same as crypto
[08:42:38] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: They charge is not 30% it’s wayyy lower !
[08:43:09] <Abhi[m]> I understand we are taxing on profit sir but how much !
[08:44:19] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: That number was not said i guess. Maybe itll be the same as now. Check how much taxes you pay on profit for stocks. I would guess it would be comparab'e
[08:44:41] <Abhi[m]> Why compare it to stocks
[08:44:47] <Abhi[m]> Technically it’s a currency
[08:44:53] <E-man[m]> * That number was not said i guess. Maybe itll be the same as now. Check how much taxes you pay on profit for stocks. I would guess it would be comparable.
[08:44:53] <E-man[m]> It will be a form of income tax only.
[08:45:08] <Abhi[m]> Why not pay how much we pay on currency exchange profit ?
[08:48:05] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: Because at the end of the day, if you are a clean person (tax wise) govt will know all streams of income right? So you'll have an upper cap of how much you can buy anything be it stocks or crypto.
[08:48:05] <E-man[m]> You already pay income tax on your earnings, so after investments if you gain profit, you income for that year will be higher, they will charge you higher income tax. Previously crypto was completely out of picture. You might have had a crore of profit but your net taxable income is say 10 lakhs. Now you will be taxed as if you are earning 1 cr.
[08:48:29] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: I dont know it could be same no details are given yet
[08:48:54] <E-man[m]> * Because at the end of the day, if you are a clean person (tax wise) govt will know all streams of income right? So you'll have an upper cap of how much you can buy anything be it stocks or crypto even if you take a loan.
[08:48:54] <E-man[m]> You already pay income tax on your earnings, so after investments if you gain profit, you income for that year will be higher, they will charge you higher income tax. Previously crypto was completely out of picture. You might have had a crore of profit but your net taxable income is say 10 lakhs. Now you will be taxed as if you are earning 1 cr.
[08:50:10] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: Yes ! Then why so much news saying 30% tax on crypto
[08:50:13] <Abhi[m]> It’s insane
[08:50:27] <Abhi[m]> > <E-man> Because at the end of the day, if you are a clean person (tax wise) govt will know all streams of income right? So you'll have an upper cap of how much you can buy anything be it stocks or crypto even if you take a loan.

Previously crypto was completely out of picture. You might have had a crore of profit but your net taxable income is say 10 lakhs. Now you will be taxed as if you are earning 1 cr.
[08:50:27] <Abhi[m]> Oh I understand
[08:51:33] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: They probably want to discourage people investing in crypto. But thing is like stocks i think it will only be applicable if you liquidate the stocks
[08:52:02] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: But technically it’s a currency
[08:52:03] <Abhi[m]> Ahahahha
[08:52:14] <E-man[m]> * Because at the end of the day, if you are a clean person (tax wise) govt will know all streams of income right? So you'll have an upper cap of how much you can buy anything be it stocks or crypto even if you take a loan.

[08:52:38] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: All currency are financial assets
[08:53:05] <E-man[m]> The same would apply in dollars. You pay the profit in dollars if you liquidate it back to inr

[08:53:46] <E-man[m]> Yes it is an investment
[08:53:47] <Abhi[m]> The profits are not taxed like stocks
[08:53:51] <Abhi[m]> Abhi[m]: This !
[08:54:30] <Abhi[m]> As I know . I am very stupid btw
[08:56:11] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: You are confusing the exchange tax (i dont know about it i never heard) and the profit you make on currency swap. Then yes currency derivatives are treated like an investment.

[09:01:12] <E-man[m]> Abhi[m]: Way less than 30% atleast. But the law makers do not know how crypto works. Just wait for a work around
[09:01:53] <Abhi[m]> E-man[m]: Exactly ! Law maker said nothing about cryptocurrency . They said about digital asset and news media spun it around
[09:06:17] <Abhi[m]> I don’t know , I am stupid from what I can tell

[15:43:47] <Zbnssn[m]> true you dont make money in short term with investments
[15:43:58] <Tor[m]> * short term " loss, * loss "
[15:44:09] <Zbnssn[m]> for that you need to work and have a salaried job dude
[15:45:17] <Tor[m]> Hell even actively managed portfolios cannot manage to beat market
[15:45:29] <Tor[m]> Only ~1% of them can
[15:46:08] <Tor[m]> And people do this day trading I'm like is it a joke or just a way to pass time
