[00:00:18] <efex_> ok, there I hear block chords, yes.. but not chords used as harmonic blocks under a melody.. it seems one or the other
[00:00:58] <Cale> Ahh, yeah, I... could do that, but I haven't done it very much yet.
[00:01:50] <efex_> that is piano player stuff
[00:01:52] <Cale> Usually that involves using one hand to play the entire chord in the bass, and the other to play the melody, which is totally possible, but feels a little less natural
[00:02:22] <efex_> I am more a keyboard player.. so I am not strong there either as for recordig I do two tracks
[00:02:22] <Cale> It's easier to split the work of my hands between the tonic/fifth and whatever thirds are present

[00:02:36] <Janet> ^ Love and Rockets - Mirror People '88 - YouTube
[00:02:37] <efex_> yes that is piles easier
[00:02:50] <efex_> but does not fill the bill
[00:04:28] <Cale> At some point, I might end up needing to get good at the more piano-like layouts (actually, 22 equal or something else that isn't meantone might drag me there)
[00:05:01] <Cale> The economics of how easy/difficult things are become quite different.
[00:05:48] <Cale> I just really like having such a nice visual representation of music theory under my fingers.
[00:06:02] <efex_> up to you :-)
[00:07:26] <Cale> But yeah, I will try to put a chord in the bass and put a melody over it more. There's not really a great excuse not to do it, it's just not how I've been thinking :)
[00:08:33] <Cale> One thing I have tried a bit is just thinking about the melodic line I want, and picking chord shapes under each note, which results in block chords again, but it's again a little different from stuff I've recorded much of.
[00:09:33] <Cale> You automatically get a harmonization where the melody is happening in extensions of the chords :)
[00:15:56] <efex_> you don’t have to tery anything on my account
[00:16:56] <efex_> “ melodic line I want, and picking chord shapes under each note, which results in block chords again,” this is harmonization based on convenience .. some advantages to that
[00:16:58] <Cale> Well, now that you've said it, I realise that it is going to be something I need to figure out

[18:55:15] <FreeRangeDillo> LV-426 of course
[18:56:18] <FreeRangeDillo> Was watching Alien vs Predator 1 yesterday, in fact
[18:57:17] <Acheron> the last two Alien movies were technical masterpieces but horrible screen writing
[18:57:57] <FreeRangeDillo> which ones are you referring to?
[18:58:05] <Acheron> the soundtrack in "Prometheus" seemed a bit off as well
[18:58:17] <morlog> covenant 
[18:58:36] <Acheron> "Prometheus" and "Alien Covenant"
[18:58:46] <FreeRangeDillo> OK yeah
[18:59:01] <Acheron> we never really got the answers at the end of "Prometheus"
[18:59:16] <morlog> yeah, seemed like the writers got impatient or something
[18:59:41] <morlog> then again
[18:59:45] <Acheron> and the zenomorph that hatched at the end of "Prometheus" seems to be the ONE
[18:59:57] <morlog> they are planning on doing all of em
[19:00:01] <Acheron> not what all David did in "Alien Covenant"
[19:00:09] <morlog> the answers could come later
[19:00:20] <Acheron> no, its bullshit screen writing
[19:00:26] <Acheron> there are no more answers
[19:00:40] <FreeRangeDillo> but the end of Prometheus did lead into the Covenant story
[19:00:55] <morlog> yeah
[19:01:21] <Acheron> Ridley Scott let the "Losties" write "Prometheus"
