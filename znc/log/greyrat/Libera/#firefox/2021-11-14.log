[00:31:06] <BaronVladimirHar> I think Gecko's implementation of multi-process is more like Webkit2 than Blink. The problem is, that Mozilla hasn't properly isolated each tab to a process.
[00:31:19] <BaronVladimirHar> Probably because Windows is hell on Earth, yet all they seem to care about.
[00:31:35] <BaronVladimirHar> If they get carried away with the processes, noticeable jank sets in on Windows.

[01:56:16] <dalias> this ^^
[01:56:40] <dalias> you should never use an account that could be closed/banned outside of your control for signon to other sites
[01:57:48] <ede> yep. use an email address and if possible something else under your control. optionally a 2nd email. you only need access to one just in case.

[14:37:10] <BaronVladimirHar> Then when that's done, just add direct dependencies to systemd (latest version, naturally) and change Firefox "Linux" to "Fedora".
[14:37:31] * t4nk_freenode doesn't do systemd.
[14:38:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Then Mozilla and IBM and Microsoft can get together and shove it into systemd and rename Firefox systemd-browserd.
[14:38:43] <BaronVladimirHar> Then decide that it still runs like crap and instead of profiling it, they can make it a Linux kernel module.

[14:47:50] <BaronVladimirHar> So of course this probably doesn't affect IBM the same way actual stable distributions will suffer.
[14:50:18] <BaronVladimirHar> I think that Debian should just find themselves a different default browser. It's not like Mozilla's the only show on the road.

[15:08:13] <ede> BaronVladimirHar: nobody gives a fuck what you do
[15:08:46] <ede> BaronVladimirHar: GNU have their own channel, go spam them how nice their browser is
[15:08:53] <BaronVladimirHar> The whole point of a browser is to load websites. So when you can't actually use a semi-current version because of stupid things the GitHub kiddies do, and you can't log into your bank or pay your bills with it even if it can start....
[15:09:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Not much good at that point.

[15:10:35] <BaronVladimirHar> The only part of GNOME Web that makes me go eww, is Youtube, but that's because Apple's Content Blockers are basically the same limitations coming up on WebExtensions.
[15:10:49] <ede> BaronVladimirHar: it's your decision to use it, so don't blame others.
[15:10:58] <BaronVladimirHar> So GNOME had to put an Adguard JavaScript into YouTube pages to forcibly unload the ads and skip to the video.
[15:11:03] <BaronVladimirHar> But other than that, just lovely.

[17:57:24] <BaronVladimirHar> You are obviously too obtuse to get what a compile time option is.
[17:57:55] <BaronVladimirHar> If someone wanted to compile them that way, I suppose they might. But the official Flatpak does not.
[17:58:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Nor does Debian.
[17:59:05] <Timvde> Lol, I am just reading blog posts that mention nothing about compile time options, and suddenly I'm "too obtuse to get what compile time options are"?
[17:59:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla also has no idea what they're doing with Flatpak permissions I guess.
[17:59:39] <Timvde> Maybe start with not pretending that other people are stupid
[18:00:27] <BaronVladimirHar> Timvde: Well, you admitted that you have no idea what you're talking about.
[18:00:56] <Timvde> I said that I believe what official blog posts tell me
[18:00:58] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox is such junk now that it's pretty difficult to even get it to build.
[18:01:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Even if you're a GNU/Linux distribution that does this all the time.
[18:01:35] <BaronVladimirHar> They sneak entirely new dependencies into a "security" update, which have nothing to do with security.
[18:01:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Then claim it's needed to run something that worked 10 years ago.

[18:22:18] <BaronVladimirHar> I would be "unhelpful" if I did. They don't care that their browser is being sabotaged by Microsoft just like they didn't care that Facebook had been doing it for years.
[18:22:58] <BaronVladimirHar> Right now all it lets you do is sign in and text chat. It puts up a banner saying Firefox is incapable of running Skype calls and you need Microsoft Edge.
[18:22:59] <Timvde> Mozilla ships multiple compat workarounds

[18:32:08] <Timvde> Distros can easily ship with that flag set to false if they want
[18:32:17] <BaronVladimirHar> Yeah, LibreWolf turns that off.
[18:32:26] <BaronVladimirHar> Along with a bunch of other Firefox junk.
[18:32:37] <BaronVladimirHar> It makes the browser almost usable again.
[18:32:42] <Timvde> So again more rants about nothing?
[18:32:48] <susi> here are all the unjunking settings: https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js
[18:33:25] <BaronVladimirHar> Die evil service workers, die die die!
[18:33:27] <BaronVladimirHar> :)
[18:34:06] <susi> is LibreWolf basically Firefox with custom user.js and some DRM problems?
[18:34:17] <BaronVladimirHar> I still went through and disabled every setting involving DRM, so it can't ask and it won't show it in the GUI.
[18:34:25] <BaronVladimirHar> Widevine works, but I don't know why you would.
[18:34:38] <susi> BaronVladimirHar: disabling media.eme.enabled is enough
[18:34:57] <BaronVladimirHar> All of the major streaming disservices block VPN users and there's this.... https://baronhk.wordpress.com/2021/10/26/on-television-streaming-boxes-and-streaming-disservices/
[18:35:22] <BaronVladimirHar> So leaving Widevine on at this point is just a security hazard useful to malware and fingerprinter scripts.
[18:35:35] <BaronVladimirHar> Fox Noise has a fingerprinting malware script that can use Widevine in Firefox.
[18:36:09] <BaronVladimirHar> Reddit had one until I posted about it and then pointed it out and someone else de-obfuscated it.
[18:36:38] <BaronVladimirHar> The same script was poking around for all sorts of things, including security holes and floating point rounding errors. Pretty creepy.
[18:37:18] <BaronVladimirHar> My point is, you don't have to be on some "dodgy" website full of, well, you know the general type.
[18:37:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Just some Conde Nasty website like Reddit or Ars Technica will do it to you if you have Firefox and the default settings.
[18:39:03] <BaronVladimirHar> Anyway, GAFAMfox isn't really helping the Web situation as it exists today.
[18:39:22] <BaronVladimirHar> So maybe LibreWolf and GNOME Web are the way to go.
[18:39:49] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla prostrates itself to Microsoft, then gets fake compatibility errors as their reward.
[18:42:08] <Timvde> So... Both GNOME Web and Firefox support disabling the antifeatures you mention, the first with a compile-time flag, the latter with a runtime flag, but somehow GNOME Web is okay, but Firefox is awful?
[18:42:52] <BaronVladimirHar> When GNOME is pointing at a version that already has the antifeatures turned off, and Debian also builds it with those rotten things turned off....
[18:43:16] <Timvde> Debian can just as well ship Firefox with those features turned off
[18:43:20] <BaronVladimirHar> And it takes <5 minutes to build yourself, with one compiler, and build scripts that actually don't make you pull out your hair and projectile vomit on your screen?
[18:43:28] <BaronVladimirHar> Unlike Mozilla browsers....
[18:43:58] <BaronVladimirHar> Timvde: Yeah, if they want Mozilla's lawyers to threaten them, again.
[18:44:08] <Timvde> ... Because you are reusing an existing webkit-gtk package that took half an hour to build on someone else's PC
[18:44:13] <BaronVladimirHar> Like the IceWeasel debacle.
[18:44:25] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: just call it IceWeasel again
[18:44:32] <BaronVladimirHar> They should!
[18:44:37] <BaronVladimirHar> That's what I've been saying.
[18:44:54] <BaronVladimirHar> Anything beats this bloatware and spyware and these anti-features.
[18:45:04] <Timvde> Mozilla doesn't want to ship a browser that breaks websites under the Mozilla trademark, which is totally understandable
[18:45:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Then they should delete Firefox.
[18:45:35] <BaronVladimirHar> It breaks T-Mobile and also Skype.
[18:46:23] <Timvde> It's also funny how you complain about webcompat caused by websites from non-Mozilla companies, then actively try to break the web by disabling tons of features :)
[18:46:26] <BaronVladimirHar> Losing 50 million users in 3 years was impressive. When they switch to Bong Search, they'll lose the next 50 million in 3 months.
[18:46:29] <BaronVladimirHar> Good. Screw them.
[18:47:05] <Timvde> Maybe you should consider the actual consequences of Firefox dying, it would be horrible for the web
[18:47:51] <Timvde> No actual competitor to Chrome except for a half-assed Safari which is maybe even worse
[18:47:57] <BaronVladimirHar> At this point, not so much.
[18:48:06] <BaronVladimirHar> Google subsidizes Mozilla as antitrust insurance.
[18:48:31] <BaronVladimirHar> They're basically a subsidiary, like Microsoft bailing out Apple in the 1990s when it teetered on bankruptcy./
[18:48:34] <Timvde> I don't really care about the reason
[18:48:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Then they want things.
[18:48:56] <Timvde> Mozilla is also trying to diversify their funds with VPN and other services
[18:48:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Like, oh, put IE on the Mac and make it the default!
[18:49:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Steve gets booed.
[18:50:19] <Timvde> Yes, so definitely just give away the web to those companies :)
[18:50:23] <Timvde> Let them be in full control
[18:50:56] <Timvde> Instead of at least having Mozilla left
[18:52:33] <BaronVladimirHar> After Mozilla collapses there will be MPL'd source code left.
[18:52:49] <BaronVladimirHar> Maybe an actual community will take it over instead of GAFAM-partner Mozilla.
[18:53:07] <Timvde> A community can't maintain a browser
[18:53:10] <BaronVladimirHar> Pale Moon or something. Who knows?
[18:53:13] <Timvde> Look at Servo, that was just the engine
[18:53:19] <BaronVladimirHar> Looks like real add-ons are back on the menu!
[18:53:42] <Timvde> And PaleMoon is a piece of shit, and the developer has no idea what he's doing
[18:54:22] <BaronVladimirHar> It was a suggestion. Doesn't have to be him.
[18:54:34] <BaronVladimirHar> Open source code that people care about doesn't die.
[18:54:36] <Timvde> Just saying that it's not realistic
[18:54:43] <BaronVladimirHar> GNOME tried to say that MATE would never live on.
[18:54:48] <Timvde> Mozilla can barely keep up with the bug browser vendors
[18:54:49] <BaronVladimirHar> They tried to kill it with FUD.
[18:54:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Look what happened. Damned thing is thriving!
[18:55:28] <Timvde> You are severely underestimating the effort needed to support a browser engine
[18:55:29] <BaronVladimirHar> Timvde: They should stop trying to.
[18:55:40] <Timvde> You could create a UI shell around an existing engine
[18:55:45] <BaronVladimirHar> They spent a lot of energy cloning bad Chrome APIs and then having to back some out.
[18:55:55] <Timvde> But Gecko is arguably the most important part of Firefox
[18:56:07] <BaronVladimirHar> They never should have implemented at least two or three dozen.
[18:56:17] <BaronVladimirHar> Not doing something is effortless.
[18:56:38] <Timvde> New API development is a process
[18:56:52] <Timvde> Prototyping is part of that
[18:56:57] <Timvde> See what works and what doesn't
[18:57:10] <BaronVladimirHar> GNOME Web is only about 2 MB as compiled code.
[18:57:20] <BaronVladimirHar> It leverages what's in Webkit.
[18:57:24] <Timvde> Yea, because you are completely ignoring webkit-gtk
[18:57:42] <BaronVladimirHar> The GTK part itself?
[18:57:52] <Timvde> The webkit part
[18:57:55] <BaronVladimirHar> I haven't done a line count, but it's small compared to the engine, certainly.
[18:58:09] <BaronVladimirHar> Who cares? Let Apple deal with it.
[18:58:14] <Timvde> Webkit lives on because of Apple
[18:58:17] <BaronVladimirHar> They're doing better than Mozilla is on Gecko.
[18:58:22] <Timvde> Do you want Apple to be in charge instead?
[18:58:59] <BaronVladimirHar> I don't really mind. Their policy is pretty cool about outside contributions.
[18:59:11] <BaronVladimirHar> They've never tried antagonizing bug reporters, like Mozilla employees do.
[18:59:58] <BaronVladimirHar> Their Bugzilla isn't a graveyard of stuff they ignore for 20 years.
[18:59:59] <BaronVladimirHar> :)
[19:00:45] <BaronVladimirHar> We already rely on plenty of things Apple technically "owns", like LLVM and CUPS.
[19:00:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla even foolishly went to LLVM and now relies on it.
[19:01:39] <BaronVladimirHar> It's more useful as part of Mesa or FTL than compiling Firefox. Clang just isn't a very good way to compile programs unless you want a lot of problems.

[19:02:49] <BaronVladimirHar> It also no-ops a lot of security hardening features.
[19:03:01] <BaronVladimirHar> It lies about supporting the ones GCC actually has, so the build doesn't fail.
[19:03:09] <BaronVladimirHar> But then your binaries aren't actually built that way.

[19:13:34] <BaronVladimirHar> GNOME Web is much less susceptible to many forms of attack, for reasons I've gone over already.
[19:13:38] <Timvde> Definitely not all reported bugs are fixed
[19:13:57] <BaronVladimirHar> But also because of the true split process model and having the bwrap sandbox and Flatpak permissions model.
[19:13:58] <Timvde> Because of features you can toggle off in Firefox...
[19:14:04] <BaronVladimirHar> In Firefox, you can get some of that.
[19:14:14] <Timvde> Firefox also has fission now
[19:14:20] <Timvde> One process per origin
[19:14:21] <BaronVladimirHar> The processes can be bubblewrapped, sure, but they aren't properly separated from each other.
[19:14:50] <BaronVladimirHar> So while it may stop them from spilling out into the rest of your computer, it won't stop malicious porn site from reading online bank password.
[19:14:53] <BaronVladimirHar> Not necessarily.
[19:14:55] <Timvde> Work on sandboxing is still ongoing, you must consider that Firefox came from a single process

[19:15:40] <Timvde> Different domains do not have access to each other.
[19:15:52] <Timvde> You need an exploit for that, you have always needed an exploit for that

[19:18:25] <Nspace> FYI firefox 94 enabled site isolation
[19:18:37] <Nspace> so now each origin in each tab runs in a different renderer, like in chrome
[19:18:40] <BaronVladimirHar> I think Canonical using Snap is their way of hacking around this dependency hell that Mozilla introduces, for no reason, even masquerading as a stability update for an ESR.
[19:18:59] <BaronVladimirHar> This is like something Microsoft would do. Oh, it's a security update. Okay. Hey, there's an MSN crapbar in my menu now!
[19:19:03] <Timvde> Canonical is shipping snaps because Mozilla asked them to
[19:19:27] <Timvde> But I don't know the exact reasons, I'm not a fan
[19:19:49] <Nspace> probably because it's easier for them to keep the browser up to date
[19:19:53] <BaronVladimirHar> If you're going to bump the Mesa requirements, bump the Mesa requirements, but don't do it in an ESR!
[19:20:20] <BaronVladimirHar> It shipped with GLX support.
[19:20:20] <t4nk_freenode> *yawn*
[19:20:30] <t4nk_freenode> sorry, don't mind me, I'm just sleepy ;)
[19:20:31] <BaronVladimirHar> The entire value of an ESR is they don't change like this!
[19:21:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Moving from GLX to EGL and requiring a new Mesa version (even though the old one did EGL fine) is ridiculous!

[22:57:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Not being in control of anything, sucks. Then they treat the only OS where they may be the default browser with nothing attacking them (GNU/Linux) very badly.
[22:58:10] <Timvde> You don't like not being in control, but you are rooting for the only browser that gives you control over the things you've been ranting about to die
[22:58:12] <BaronVladimirHar> They're finding out what Chromebooks on one side and Edge insisting on clobbering them to death on Windows 11 on the other is like. It doesn't get better from here.
[22:58:55] <BaronVladimirHar> If they do, then someone may pick it up, chuck the nasty shit, and make it a fully Free browser.
[22:59:05] <BaronVladimirHar> Key word being "may".
[22:59:19] <Timvde> Yes, and it is very unlikely
[22:59:28] <Timvde> A browser is not something you can develop as a hobby project
[22:59:35] <BaronVladimirHar> Right now I'm rooting for LibreWolf to "Libera Chat" them.
[22:59:44] <BaronVladimirHar> Because in this comparison, Mozilla is Andrew Lee's Freenode.
[23:00:00] <Timvde> Plot twist: LibreWolf doesn't stand a chance to survive without Firefox/Mozilla
[23:00:10] <BaronVladimirHar> The first step is undoing this mess with the spyware and junk and crap APIs.
[23:01:01] <BaronVladimirHar> LibreWold actually does have sane defaults, but it's also quite new.
[23:01:05] <BaronVladimirHar> So there's rough spots.
[23:01:13] <BaronVladimirHar> s/LibreWold/LibreWolf/
[23:01:39] <BaronVladimirHar> About the only thing I changed was it logs history so I can see where I'm going and makes an exception to leave me signed in here.
[23:02:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Oh yeah, and so one of my banks doesn't ask for 2FA every time I go to it.
[23:02:55] <BaronVladimirHar> I think things like this should be an exception to a default deny policy.

[23:05:11] <BaronVladimirHar> I think plenty Apple does is nasty. That's why I don't have any Apple products.
[23:05:18] <Timvde> Except Webkit, apparently
[23:05:21] <BaronVladimirHar> Their app store monopoly doesn't really affect me.
[23:05:24] <Timvde> You are totally fine with them developing Webkit
[23:05:29] <BaronVladimirHar> They stole that.
[23:05:34] <BaronVladimirHar> It's KHTML.
[23:05:44] <Timvde> Sure, but in practice, KHTML is dead now
[23:06:08] *** Joins: hans (~hans@46.46.192.205)
[23:06:26] <BaronVladimirHar> Yeah, and the way they did it was deliberate. Working in secret for over a year and a half.
[23:06:37] <BaronVladimirHar> Then throws code over the fence with no patches broken out for minimal license compliance.
[23:07:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Dave Hyatt was abandoning Mozilla and going to Apple before it was cool.
[23:07:40] <BaronVladimirHar> I actually see these folks at Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and Apple headhunting for people Mitchell Baker is firing.
[23:07:58] <BaronVladimirHar> While she takes millions per year, produces nothing, and gives a Global Diversity Officer a raise.
[23:08:00] <Timvde> Lots of them are definitely very talented
[23:09:21] <BaronVladimirHar> Many CEOs who have a company in trouble agree to work for a dollar a year for a while or something. Baker will fill up her bank account and scram.
[23:09:47] <Timvde> That discussion is a lot more complicated than you make it out to be, and I'm really not going to get into it
[23:10:17] <Timvde> If anything, her salary would allow Mozilla to keep a handful more developers, while about 250 were laid off
[23:10:26] <Timvde> So it definitely wouldn't have solved anything
[23:11:01] <Timvde> Maybe you should try to support Mozilla if you don't want them to lose developers
[23:13:31] <BaronVladimirHar> Is Brave even really fully Free?

[23:13:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Why aren't they just in the repo in distributions like Debian? Or in Flatpak? What's with all of this repo and signing key mess?
[23:14:03] <BaronVladimirHar> Forcing users to fix it whenever it falls apart?
[23:14:17] <BaronVladimirHar> That's really the only thing holding me back from trying to install it.
[23:14:27] <BaronVladimirHar> If you can't even figure out packaging, lol.
[23:15:01] <BaronVladimirHar> I think they're the only ones even trying to pull all of this privacy mess and the Google tentacles out of Chromium.
[23:15:24] <BaronVladimirHar> So if Firefox goes under, they're probably positioned to take advantage of that.
[23:16:10] <BaronVladimirHar> I miss when you could throw a stone and hit 10 browsers and they all had their own engine.
[23:16:41] <BaronVladimirHar> The fact that it takes a Google to write an engine is a disaster. It says everything.
[23:17:06] <BaronVladimirHar> It proves me right. Firefox should not be in a hurry to clone all of thise stuff.
