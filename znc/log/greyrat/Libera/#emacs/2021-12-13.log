[04:16:09] <bpalmer> An NFT is , in the best analogy I've seen, an autograph. You can have millions of movie posters for Dune all around the world that are basically free -- when Dune leaves theaters, most of those posters will probably be thrown away in the trash.
[04:16:44] <perrierjouet> an autograph signed by who ?

[04:19:28] <fsbot> rgel: rg.el is an Emacs search package based on the ripgrep command line tool. It allows you to interactively create searches, doing automatic searches based on the editing context, refining and modifying search results and much more. It is also highly configurable to be able to fit different users’ needs. (https://rgel.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.3/)
[04:19:54] <bpalmer> MattBeshara: you mean highlight other occurences of the symbol at point where it shows up elsewhere in the buffer?

[04:25:26] <n`> perrierjouet: What would you do with anything of that nature? It's not like most things have any inherent value. It's the value you assign to it.

[05:56:06] <pjb> bremner: not exactly.  It creates a new list with all the elements  from something followed by other-thing.
[05:56:17] <bremner> *shrug*
[05:56:24] *** Joins: relight (~relight@user/relight)
[05:56:43] <bpalmer> kindablue: I'd suggest bremner's approach, but if you must needs mutate it, use setcdr on the last cons cell of the list.
[05:56:53] <pjb> kindablue: (let ((list (list 1 2 3))) (nconc list (cons 4 nil)) list) --> (1 2 3 4)
[05:57:06] <pjb> kindablue: but don't try to nconc a literal string!
[05:58:16] <kindablue> right...i tried append but that resulted in (1 2 3 . 4) which i wasn't sure if it was the same thing
[05:59:28] <kindablue> i will go with nconc
[06:00:00] <bpalmer> kindablue: (append '(1 2 3) (list 4)) => (1 2 3 4) but (append '(1 2 3) 4) => (1 2 3 . 4)
[06:00:01] <pjb> kindablue: note the difference between (append '(1 2 3) 4)  and (append '(1 2 3) (list 4))
[06:00:19] <kindablue> ahh right 
[06:00:57] <bpalmer> kindablue: a list is either nil, or a cons cell with the value in its car, and its cdr set to a list. (1 2 3 . 4) is not a proper list, because the cons cell that 3 is car of has just "4" as its cdr value.
[06:01:52] <bpalmer> (list 4) , on the other hand, creates a cons cell with 4 as its car value and nil as its cdr , so you can stick it at the end of the list and preserve the list property.
[06:02:58] <kindablue> okay i understand

[06:03:21] <kindablue> is that how one would create an alist? is that why they have the period?
[06:05:38] <kindablue> also, I've tried adding this function https://0x0.st/-Ftg.txt to text-mode-hook and it still changes the global value of completion-at-point-functions

[06:07:22] <n`> kindablue: (describe-function #'add-hook)
[06:07:27] <bpalmer> an alist is a list of cons cells;  (list (cons 1 2) (cons 3 4) (cons 5 (cons 6 nil))) => ((1 . 2) (3 . 4) (5 6)) . You see a period is skipped when the cdr is itself a cons cell
[06:07:28] <pjb> kindablue: yes, but you'd use (acons 'key 'value a-list)
[06:07:54] <pjb> (acons 'k1 'v1 (acons 'k2 'v2 '())) --> ((k1 . v1) (k2 . v2))

[06:09:44] <bpalmer> kindablue: add-hook with a LOCAL argument may be a way to go, but to explain what's going on: nconc *mutates* its argument.
[06:10:10] <bpalmer> so the (setq-local ...) means you're only affecting the local argument, but at that point,  the arguments have already been evaluated
[06:10:47] <bpalmer> (nconc completion-at-point-functions (list #'cape-ispell)) has mutated the list the global variable is pointing at.
[06:11:04] <kindablue> yeah i know of the local add-hook i guess i should have been more explicit as to why it seemend setq-local was being overridden
[06:11:06] <bpalmer> This is why using append is usually preferred , unless you *know* it's safe to mutate arguments.

[06:11:24] <bpalmer> append creates a new list from its arguments, leaving the old lists unaffected.
[06:11:25] <kindablue> but that would explain the issues i faced with trying to use nreverse earlier
[06:11:47] <bpalmer> yeah, all the n* functions mutate -- reverse copies.
[06:11:56] *** Joins: capfredf (~capfredf@c-68-51-122-2.hsd1.in.comcast.net)
[06:13:28] <kindablue> this was my previous attempt which didn't use nreverse on the global variable
[06:13:33] <kindablue> https://0x0.st/-FtI.txt
[06:13:37] <kindablue> but still had the same effect
[06:14:09] <kindablue> do assigning variables within a let still reference the original one?
[06:14:57] *** Quits: pmy (~user@user/pmy) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[06:15:14] <bpalmer> kindablue: let works on the association between symbols and objects; nreverse and other mutating functions mutate the objects.
[06:15:51] <bpalmer> kindablue: so it doesn't matter whether you're using a local variable to point to the object or a global variable; what matters is the object itself. 
[06:16:46] <bpalmer> Think of it like (let* ((a (cons 1 2)) (b a)) (setcdr a 3) (list a b)) => ((1 . 3) (1 . 3))   both a and b look to be affected, because it's the object that was mutated.

[06:17:14] *** Joins: pmy (~user@user/pmy)
[06:19:00] <bpalmer> For a more complicated example: (let* ((a (list 1 2)) (b (list 1 2)) (c a)) (list a b (nreverse c))) => ((1) (1 2) (2 1))  <-- the call of (nreverse c) affects a, because it's mutating the underlying object; a is now pointing at the tail end of the list
[06:20:34] <kindablue> ahh okay. so its not duplicating the data in the new variable. just pointing to it.
[06:21:06] <kindablue> sorry if this is standard stuff. not a programmer by any means, i appreciate the help
[06:22:57] <grym> you appear to be one! 
[06:22:59] <kindablue> i like the example. i would have a question about the "order of execution" so to speak, of (list a b (nreverse c)).
[06:23:34] <kindablue> is there a book you'd recommend? i believe i've heard sicp is good
[06:23:38] <bpalmer> a is evaluated, b is evaluated, c is evaluated , (nreverse c) is evaluted, then list is evaluated
[06:23:46] <bpalmer> in elisp, left to right, inner to outer.
[06:24:13] <bpalmer> at least in practice, although I think elisp is kind of annoyingly vague about concrete semantics like that.
[06:24:48] <kindablue> oh right, and since c points to a, nreverse will mutate it. 
[06:24:50] <bpalmer> SICP is a classic but it teaches scheme, which is a language like elisp but not identical.
[06:25:05] <acdw> hey how would yall rewrite a (catch :return (dolist (thing list) ... (throw :return value))) using `cl-loop' ?
[06:25:31] <bpalmer> acdw: (loop for thing in list ... return value)
[06:25:42] <acdw> oh duh haha. that does an early return as well?
[06:25:57] <bpalmer> yep.
[06:26:02] <acdw> oooh thanks
[06:26:09] <bpalmer> (cl-loop for a in '(1 2 3) return a) => 1

[08:19:24] <nnnnn> sachac: I enjoyed some of the more technical talks. Andrea's update on the native comp feature was interesting. I felt like Stefan's "code janitor" talk was good, too, from a practical stand point. I watched quite a few of them, I just was surprised to see less discussion on reddit about them.
[08:20:02] <nnnnn> sachac: Rather, less talk about the conf in general.
