[09:16:47] <tirnanog> strange. the group is matheus. so there's no reason that g+w should have been a problem, if it's your primary group.

[11:55:56] <jmariondev> jelle:  that's true, but I have seen the same behavior with no associated rise in temperature. GNOME immediately slows to ~1FPS only when the lid is closed

[11:58:35] <mikebutash_> it is what it is, after a few recent upgrades it started doing dumb shit like throttling down to nothing with no outside intevention, I'm just working around the dumb shit.
[11:58:40] <grawity> though I guess running a laptop closed does disrupt passive cooling a little bit
[11:58:50] <raster> it's just gnome dropping updates to a screen that is not visible... depending if its x or wl- might be a different background reason... :)
[11:59:05] <jelle> grawity: on a m1 it would be killing :P
[11:59:13] <mikebutash_> I'm open to ideas, but easist path to resolution for me.

[12:06:06] <raster> but i know why it might be doing this because wm's/compositors have to handle lid events (e does it differently - it actually removes the lid screen on lid close and reconfigures displays moving windows around and so on)
[12:06:19] <jmariondev> reading about it now, it looks like it was caused by secondary displays' update rate being fixed to the primary display. when that primary display is closed the compositor reduced it to 1FPS, and the external monitors followed suit

[14:42:20] <Zeyphros> "bootable" drives don't exist in uefi booting afaik. The partition with the esp flag should be used automatically.

[14:46:46] <Feuermagier> like, where is that "ESP flag" you mentioned stored for example
[14:46:50] <Zeyphros> Feuermagier: I honestly have no clue. In my experience, they just list all drives with an esp partition
[14:46:59] <another|> IIUC, there is no flags
[14:47:08] <grawity> it doesn't really *care* about the "ESP flag" (which isn't actually a flag, it's a special type ID)
[14:47:29] <another|> can't you just point your EFI to the disk?
[14:47:34] <grawity> but usually the OS tells it – the motherboard's NVRAM stores a list of boot entries with label + device + file path
[14:47:59] <grawity> for removable drives though, it looks for FAT32 partitions that contain an \EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI file
[14:48:06] <Feuermagier> another|, interestingly there is no such option
[14:48:46] <grawity> normally the ESP on fixed disks has a specific "partition type GUID" set, but that's mostly optional
[14:49:26] <grawity> (partition types are stored in the partition table, both for MBR and GPT)

[15:56:54] <grawity> a fairly normal error meaning that you're trying to execute a file that's currently still open
[15:57:05] <grawity> e.g. by your text editor
[15:57:22] <grawity> though I'm not sure why with NFS it still persists for a short while even after the editor should've closed the file
[15:58:37] <roxlu> grawity: ok thanks, yeah it happens when I save a file (e.g. bash script) and then try to execute it

[18:17:29] <zoug> hello, I have opened LUKS partitions on a VM, but would like to check that I have the right passphrase. So I don't want to close them in case I don't have the right passphrase, but would just like to check. The "cryptsetup luksOpen --test-passphrase" command does exactly this but does not work on already opened LUKS partitions (same as luksDump and
[18:17:30] <zoug> other cryptsetup commands), is there any way to do what I am asking without closing the partition? Thanks a lot

[23:30:42] <rcf> I use .profile for anything that can be configured for a POSIX shell, and then source it in other configs. 
[23:31:12] <hrehf> hmmm. I checked and all my autostarts where X11 relying anyways, so I just put them into .xprofile instead, but I'm still confused by the experience :-)

[23:32:34] <rcf> The usual convention is profile is read for login shells, rc is read for all interactive shells. I blatantly reject this convention and source profile everywhere, relying on conditionals instead.

[23:36:17] <frojnd> I'm trying to find out why my hardware is failing. I've ruled out hard drives, CPU/memory load. I think it's GPU issue. If I startx or other distro or microsoft windows system just freezes after a couple of minutes
