[16:11:42] <elflng> i actually like C
[16:12:27] <elflng> someone described it as high level generic assembler, which i thought was cute, and which probably made all the fortranners' heads to spin around and emit pea soup in projectile fashion...
[16:12:53] <elflng> it does what i want it to do and i dont have to fight with the syntax, unlike c++
[16:13:23] <sjamaan> elflng: It's this "undefined behaviour" nonsense that's the real problem with C
[16:13:38] <sjamaan> Compilers simply removing or rearranging security-critical code and so on
[16:13:51] <elflng> ah
[16:14:11] <sjamaan> They're taking it too far
[16:14:14] <elflng> back when i was your age, the compile didnt mess around in such ways. is this endemic across compilers or is it just gcc being annoying?
[16:14:30] <sjamaan> From what I understand, it's endemic nowadays
[16:14:33] <elflng> ugh.
[16:14:42] <elflng> the compiler should not try to be smarter than the programmer.
[16:15:11] <elflng> as soon as the compiler can design itself, i will remove this objection.
[16:15:16] <sjamaan> heh
[16:16:03] <elflng> on happier notes, wsl is actually really really nice. ive been very happy since i have to work in windows to actually be able to use a reasonable environment.
[16:18:30] <sjamaan> Nice
[16:19:02] <elflng> (also, happy pi day. its almost 3.14 15... 
[16:19:10] <elflng> you cant do 92, unfortunately. pity.)
[16:19:39] <elflng> maybe if you carry over, it will be 3.14 16:32...
[16:20:02] <sjamaan> heh
[16:23:48] <elflng> im trying to figure out if sockets (network) should be scheme ports or not
[16:24:02] <elflng> its kinda a big deal either way
[16:25:45] <sjamaan> Have you checked out the "socket" egg?
[16:26:24] <sjamaan> It models sockets separately, with the ability to open a Scheme port for the socket object
[16:26:55] <sjamaan> It's too low-level for typical uses, so there are also the udp6 and tcp6 eggs built on top of it

[18:49:56] <C-Keen> ah but language implementors love undefined behaviour right? Looking at you r5rs...
[18:50:52] <Bunny351> it's not the same.
[18:51:38] <Bunny351> C compilers actually break your code and blame you, in a totally unsafe environment
[18:51:56] <C-Keen> True that's clearly not the same
[18:52:19] <Bunny351> a R5RS scheme that crashes or leaves security holes in undefd situiations will not be very popular
[18:53:15] <Bunny351> also the undefined situations are clearly and publicly defined
