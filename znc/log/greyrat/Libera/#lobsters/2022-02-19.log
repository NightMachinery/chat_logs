[06:43:48] <jackalope> That article is lousy and contains very little substance.  Its main assertion appears to be that Rust is "too complex", when in fact Rust appears more complex in some respects because one can't skip considering memory safety.  That was still part of C and C++, people just came up with bad work-arounds that often caused bugs.

[23:57:06] <rb> okay so i can't decide on how to handle errors in my programming language. i could do it like the original self does and take an IfFail: block where the block receives the error (so kind of like javascript error handling callbacks), or i could implement those newer Result/ErrorOr style objects and give the code a way to make it bubble. now how that would fit into the rather conservative syntax of
