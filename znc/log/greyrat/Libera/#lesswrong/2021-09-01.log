[00:28:01] <feep> 57/57 achievements :3
[00:28:09] <feep> at 29 hours, so that's the absolute total playtime.
[00:28:51] <feep> also lol, there is no achievement in this game that's more rare than 5% of players, including "get all figments" this game has a *very* dedicated playerbase :D
[00:28:54] <rmmh> overall rating?
[00:29:12] <feep> bit less good than the first, when correcting for the passage of time
[00:29:14] <rmmh> I do love negative steam reviews with hundreds of hours
[00:29:26] <feep> but solid follow-up
[00:30:09] <feep> also lol, more people have "find all pigments" than "acquire all upgrades"
[00:30:13] <feep> figments*
[00:30:25] <feep> who stops after that super hard achievement and doesn't 100% the leveling?

[02:18:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disappointed in my loaf pan (which I initially praised highly). Why? Nonstick coating is flaking off, of course. I suppose I should've expected it. But it seemed so nice at first... oh well. I guess nobody makes these things to last
[02:18:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bought a cast-iron loaf pan. (I would've liked carbon steel, but can't find such.) Lodge brand. Supposedly "pre-seasoned", but this thing's clearly gonna take a lot of seasoning before proper use.
[02:19:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> One clear advantage already: because it's *cast*, there's no seams at all. Nowhere for food/oil to get stuck, etc. But downside: volume is smaller than the nonstick one. (Or maybe not a downside? It'll make for taller loafs...)

[02:30:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wish Lodge would give these things a smooth surface :\
[02:31:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess that'd drive up the price too much, but damn, this thing is like the roughest grade of sandpaper
[02:33:47] <aweinstock> IIRC one colleague was looking into baking off the pre-existing coating of his cast iron (I think using oven self-clean), sanding it smoother, and then re-seasoning it, but I'm not sure how it ended up, or what tooling he planned on sanding it with
[02:34:36] <aweinstock> the intermediate pans (without the seasoning) were a dull grey instead of black
[02:34:43] <ggreer> you can take the coating off with strong soap. just put it in the dishwasher
[02:36:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah for sure but there's little point in doing that with a loaf pan
[02:37:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It'd be a hell of a job to sand down the inside surface of that
[02:37:35] <ggreer> I keep hearing that ceramic nonstick pans wear out quickly, but so far I've enjoyed mine
[02:37:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, they do wear out quickly in my experience
[02:38:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2 years at the outside, and the nonstickness will be disappearing
[02:38:28] <aweinstock> the sanding was for a skillet/frying pan
[02:38:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've been using a Teflon-esque nonstick, and it's lasted longer
[02:39:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> However I think my pans in the future will mostly be carbon steel, such as https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019N4ZHQ (which I currently own) but in various other sizes/shapes

[08:08:15] <feepbot> <gwern> 'What I’ve found in my research—which is focused on the nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century, so I can’t speak for today—is that most people who were quarantined agreed in principle with their incarceration and with quarantine. They believed that it was a just thing for them to be quarantined—in principle. They often talk about that at the very beginning
[08:08:15] <feepbot> of their period of quarantine. Once they’ve been placed into quarantine, it all seems quite different. So, in theory, people believe in quarantine—but when you’ve been sitting for two months in a facility that often isn’t very well-equipped for people to live there, because they’re set up just for the occasions they might be needed, and often they’re not very nice or
[08:08:15] <feepbot> comfortable places to be, things seem very different. One of the things that comes across consistently in people’s quarantine experiences is boredom. They complain about the accommodation and the food, and they get sick of the people they’re quarantined with—all those very normal human responses.'

[09:56:56] <nshepperd2> there's some sort of moral panic about it in the uk but that doesn't necessarily mean the statistics are that much
[10:00:54] <PapuaHardyNet> let's be honest, teenagers who have gender dysphoria are mostly suffering from depression, and the idea of becoming another gender is an dream that lets them cope
[10:01:19] <nshepperd2> idk about that
[10:01:53] <PlanckWalk> There should be predictive differences there.
[10:01:57] <PlanckWalk> Are they observed?
[10:01:58] <nshepperd2> i mean, that gets the causality the wrong way around. gender dysphoria is immensely depressing
[10:02:39] <mst> IIRC of kids who present to a GIC with dysphoria style symptoms about 2/3 end up desisting and end up as GNC and often gay, and the other 1/3 go through to transition
[10:04:30] <nshepperd2> especially as a teenager, when you're in the middle of experiencing everything get more and more permanently wrong in slow motion
[10:05:29] <mst> nshepperd2: right, I think it should be unsurprising that both categories will initially present relatively similarly and which adulthood the kid's going to end up being most happy with will have to be figured out on a case by case basis
[10:06:01] <quanticle> My question for mst still stands though: has there been a statistical uptick in the rate of female-to-male transitions lately?
[10:06:34] <mst> quanticle: there's been a lot of anecdotal stuff coming out of the US, I don't believe it's been studied to a useful standard yet
[10:07:00] <mst> my point was more "the people panicking about it appear to be ignoring the 'this is just reality shaking out' possibility"
[10:07:17] <mst> naturally certain 'trans allies' are ignoring the possibility it could be anything else
[10:07:25] <mst> so most discussion of it gets eaten by Discourse very rapidly
[10:08:18] <quanticle> Oh. Well, my usual caveat still stands then: before we try to explain why somehthing is true, we should first verify whether it is true. Maybe there isn't really an uptick in female-to-male transitions and the panic is just... people having moral panics because they see their pretty daughters turning into ugly boys or some shit
[10:08:56] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: I agree with you, but I'm curious about what you think about the fact that gender dysphoria has been successfully treated in people with antidepressants

[11:34:43] <mst> quanticle: this is why e.g. "use re 're2';" is useful in perl to switch to an engine designed to not have that problem before using potentially user controlled regexps, yeah
[11:34:53] <pompolic> i've seen some shit
[11:35:03] <pompolic> "so this is how you use regexes as a SAT solver"
[11:35:11] <mst> the full perl regexp engine is glorious but only acceptable on user supplied input when the user would only be DoSing themselves

[11:36:45] <pompolic> he did this because he could

[11:43:24] <pompolic> (I don't know them, i just know that there's a strong formal languages tradition)
[11:47:09] <pompolic> i like this idea -- the parser library i'm using purposely imposes limitations on how results of a parse can depend on prior results (i.e. context handling i guess)
[11:47:35] <pompolic> and so i just started passing a struct in that's scoped to, in fact, the parse
[11:48:02] <quanticle> Isn't that just it enforcing that the language you're passing satisfies the requirements of a context-free grammar?
[11:48:16] <quanticle> (Which is good, IMO)
[11:48:24] <pompolic> that's exactly what it is
[11:48:38] <pompolic> there are some concessions but it's deliberately ugly and hard to use
[11:48:42] <pompolic> as far as i know
[11:49:15] <pompolic> in practice you gotta parse TLVs and similar witchery i guess
[11:49:45] <pompolic> (if only TLVs were the worst thing i encountered)
[11:50:50] <pompolic> if you look at the Chomsky hierarchy, going from CF to context-sensitive is where you have to start using Turing machines to implement the grammar

[12:03:24] <quanticle> See, if you don't have cart corrals, well, that's different. I can see how it'd be inconvenient to trudge all the way back up to the store entrance to return the cart. But there are people in that thread who say that, even when cart corrals are provided, they don't use them.
[12:04:24] <quanticle> Also I second your sentiment on four-way stop signs

[13:12:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who is this guy, anyway?
[13:12:21] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, you might say that he learned to better approximate the edge of in/comprehensibility that good composers work on
[13:12:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> People on LW are weirdly indulgent of his random-ass bullshit
[13:12:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: What the hell does that mean
[13:13:03] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, you know how music is good when you can spot its patterns at some moderate level of difficulty?
[13:13:05] <saturn2> good writing isn't at the edge of incomprehensibility
[13:14:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: I do not have the slightest idea what you're talking about, no
[13:14:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Music is good when it sounds good and is enjoyable to listen to
[13:14:28] <Gurkenglas> There's a genre of writing that is made of foreshadowing. Maybe (might update after actually reading what he wrote lately) he's falling into the failure mode where the people subscribed to him have learned to comprehend him so he's slightly less comprehensible than required for a newcomer to enjoy his stuff?
[13:14:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> But he's not writing anything worth reading, as far as I can tell

[13:30:01] <pompolic> nah, i'm pretty sure i'm a bit too obfuscated for here, but it's a work in progress
[13:31:47] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: this makes me think of procedurally generated content
[13:32:12] <pompolic> novelty wears off once you just cache the generator, instead of the individual instances, i think
[13:36:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "novelty" is not what we should want from LW posts!
[13:36:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Chasing novelty when you should be chasing correctness and usefulness is epistemic poison
[13:37:04] <pompolic> strong agreement
[13:37:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've seen it destroy entire academic fields
[13:37:18] <pompolic> although i think there is a use for novelty-seeking: escaping shitty local maxima
[13:37:30] <quanticle> Novelty is a secondary characteristic of what we should want from Lesswrong posts. The primary characteristic should, of course, be correctness, but a series of posts that explain what we already know is also not valuable.
[13:38:45] <pompolic> when i first read the sequences my impression was "wow someone is writing about stuff i thought about already, but better and more extensively"
[13:39:16] <Gurkenglas> To procedurally generate music, I'd train a CLIP-like that connects audio with a vector space of music tropes, take a number of samples of music that the user likes, and look for a simple combining formula that produces good feedback. Such as "identify an operation that would take all but one sample's vector and have a high likelihood of generating the missing one, then apply it to the entire set"

[13:48:16] <Gurkenglas> Ah, I didn't understand your suggestion until just now.

[13:56:39] <quanticle> >i wonder if those people think antidepressants can make you happy as a clam no matter what situation you're in
[13:56:41] <quanticle> It's possibly true. Most people in really shitty situations aren't actually all that unhappy. Yes, they'll certainly take opportunities to improve their lives more, but day-to-day, they're capable of waking up, getting out of bed and functioning in a way that a person with severe clinical depression is not.
[13:57:04] <PapuaHardyNet> but what actually happens is that they comply to DMCA requests. Are DMCA requests different from burn requests though?
[13:57:10] <kuudes> yes
[13:57:20] <kuudes> burn is to destroy the data, bury is to hide the data
[13:57:40] <kuudes> it is ok to prevent anyone from accessing the data in next 100 years, it is not ok to destroy the data so that it won't ever exist
[13:57:56] <PapuaHardyNet> oh! so they take it out of public/ but keep it. Makes sense.
[13:58:02] <kuudes> archivists should not prioritize currently living people over the long future
[13:58:32] <kuudes> it is to prevent current emperor from deleting the history from the t+5000 years in future humans
[13:58:42] <kuudes> hence bury but not burn
[13:58:54] <ivan> it's uh not very productive to blame archivists for protecting their archive from the copyright cops
[13:59:04] <kuudes> indeed
[13:59:04] <ivan> be grateful you have access to any of it or something
[13:59:08] <kuudes> that
[13:59:32] <kuudes> journalists are the group to keep information available for current people, and they have different ethos and different fights
[13:59:55] <kuudes> archivists != journalists
[14:00:01] <PapuaHardyNet> idk man, maybe they should remove their middle finger to DMCA. Also their community is very... uh, elitist? I'm not quite sure. I don't like them.
[14:00:29] <kuudes> yeah, I agree on likely middle fingers are not very pro archivism
[14:00:47] <ivan> the-eye guy moved on to doing AI or something. he's not very responsive any more
[14:00:56] <kuudes> archivists should be the most deferential people, most gray people, who won't complain if you do crimes against humanity as long as you don't burn the records

[14:06:10] <kuudes> someone else explain Gurkenglas?
[14:06:15] <mst> kuudes: IRC is truly the cockroach of protocols
[14:06:17] <Gurkenglas> Why should archives not comply with burn requests? ._.
[14:06:26] <kuudes> mst, :D
[14:06:36] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, so that information gets saved to the future
[14:06:52] <Gurkenglas> What if the originator does not want it to get saved to the future?
[14:06:59] <kuudes> they don't get a say
[14:07:09] <Gurkenglas> Why do they get a say about present usage but not future usage?
[14:07:24] <kuudes> so that they interfere less with storing the information to the future
[14:07:47] <saturn2> they can hurt you in the present but in the future they will be dead
[14:07:50] <Gurkenglas> Why does getting it to the future trump their preferences but having it be accessible today does not?
[14:08:01] <kuudes> because that is the axiom of archivism
[14:08:13] <Gurkenglas> How did you come to adopt that axiom?
[14:08:14] <quanticle> Good news: our AWACs folks are messaging each other on a bandwidth-saving text-oriented protocol
[14:08:16] <quanticle> Bad news: the bandwidth-saving text-oriented protocol is IRC
[14:08:18] <quanticle> Worse news: their IRC client is mIRC
[14:08:38] <kuudes> I am not myself an archivist
[14:08:42] <saturn2> or in other words, you are killing them and taking their info, using the murder weapon of allowing time to pass
[14:09:34] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, so you mean "they should do this because they, being an archivist, want to do this"?
[14:09:40] <kuudes> yes
[14:10:20] <kuudes> in ancient china there were apparently both librarians who burned books when emperor told them to, and librarians who buried the books when emperor told them to destroy the books
[14:10:33] <kuudes> the burned books never returned, buried books are sometimes found
[14:10:45] <pompolic> nice <anything> you have there, would be a shame if someone were to remember it
[14:10:46] <kuudes> we appreciate the latter, we should do the same
[14:11:11] <PapuaHardyNet> A century from now someone will be reading these chat logs
[14:11:28] <saturn2> if we're lucky
[14:11:31] <kuudes> hi future reader!
[14:11:52] <kuudes> I hope you have more friendly than unfriendly values, and succeed in those values
[14:11:55] <pompolic> quick, post infohazards
[14:12:07] <Gurkenglas> There, that sounds like a reason that's more underlying than an axiom :). So it's that you care about the ancient content but you don't care about the preferences of the ancient people who wanted you to not have it.
[14:12:47] <kuudes> if I was to be an archivist, I should aim to be a paperclipper with value for storing the information to future, I think
[14:13:57] <Gurkenglas> Suppose we develop a read-only past-only time machine. Do you think we should use it to retrieve the unpublished notes of authors who would not want them published?
[14:14:16] <pompolic> is it a question aimed at everyone?
[14:14:19] <kuudes> quanticle, "The 960th AACS accomplished the first ever, 100-percent operational rate with mIRC during one of their sorties, said Colonel Brundidge. "The mIRC system faces unique challenges on the E-3, so to accomplish a 100-percent operational rate is a big success," said Chief Master Sgt. Lick."
[14:14:37] <kuudes> on plus side, they finally got irc working as result of afganistan war
[14:14:46] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, sure, why not.
[14:15:05] <Gurkenglas> But I do hope for a reply from kuudes :P
[14:15:07] <PapuaHardyNet> how do they even post IRC messages, through their phones?
[14:15:20] <pompolic> the haha funny response i would give is "if they have a problem with me disrespecting their preferences, they can take it up to me"
[14:15:32] <pompolic> this will work until we have beta uploads or something
[14:15:39] <quanticle> kuudes: I'm glad we got some benefit out of it :D

[14:17:38] <pompolic> oh no, please don't recover my brain data and upload into computer, what will i dooooo

[14:22:12] <Gurkenglas> I posit that some people want privacy, that their preferences are valid, that they would call a future that watches their every waking moment horrifying, and that we shouldn't create a world like that out of caution against futures that ~10% of humans would call horrifying.

[14:24:19] <PapuaHardyNet> is that you quant?
[14:24:23] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: one can get used to it. i have a hard time reconciling my preference for privacy with just wanting to consume all the information. i think i'd break towards "ok fine no privacy for me then either"
[14:24:42] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Yep
[14:24:46] <pompolic> not because i like that, mind
[14:25:07] <pompolic> but a lot of privacy seems enforced by fiat/regulation
[14:25:20] <pompolic> it seems like a stupid bedrock to build on
[14:25:32] <saturn2> i think the preference for privacy from people you might interact with is valid, but not otherwise
[14:25:47] <pompolic> that makes sense to me
[14:25:47] <nshepperd2> privacy doesn't seem that important when the people watching can't possibly hurt me
[14:26:06] <pompolic> or: privacy moment-to-moment
[14:26:24] <pompolic> because in any given moment i'm just an idiot subset of my potential versions
[14:26:52] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Well, if they can bring back your consciousness, in simulation or otherwise, they certainly can hurt you.
[14:27:32] <nshepperd> sure
[14:28:20] <nshepperd> i think we should respect people's right to die, including destroying soul relevant information if available
[14:28:22] <pompolic> just become the ai in the box
[14:28:59] <pompolic> (less jokingly: i feel like torture simulation discourse takes it as a given that the simulation is inescapable)
[14:29:31] <pompolic> (i think even making it infeasible to escape implies some serious advances in infosec will have been made in the interim)

[14:30:50] <pompolic> i can't even play a video game without accidentally breaking the simulation
[14:31:09] <quanticle> Yeah, but your video games aren't designed by a superintelligent AI
[14:31:17] <pompolic> just gotta incentivize the future simulators to simulate a smarter version of me
[14:31:20] <pompolic> yeah i was gonna say
[14:31:31] <synthmeat> they needed men outside in the matrix
[14:32:36] <Gurkenglas> So there's surely people that would rather die than have the rest of their life watched. If every night they dream of a fictional world, they might not want that fiction published. If they write it down because their memory & imagination isn't that good, that is also just another difference of degree. I don't claim I have such preferences myself, and I don't claim that we can satisfy *everyone*, but I can see 
[14:32:37] <Gurkenglas> why people want requests to burn complied with. See right to be forgotten.
[14:32:41] <pompolic> in this discussion i think we were talking about future people, which aren't necessarily superintelligences
[14:33:04] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: ok that's just Literally Me lol
[14:33:34] <pompolic> and it kind of informed all that thinking about privacy, ironically enough

[14:33:53] <pompolic> i didn't want the insane people stealing my paracosm basically
[14:35:43] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, encryption isn't future-proof. Consider airgapping the harddrive and having a reliable method of future-proof destruction.
[14:37:15] <PapuaHardyNet> now you've made me paranoid
[14:37:28] <kuudes> mind you that gdpr right to be forgotten makes specific allowances for scientific research and archiving
[14:37:53] <kuudes> legal system indeed tries to solve this partly with credentialism
[14:38:21] <kuudes> ie people who are professors in an university have more rights than the rest of us in the domain of scientific research
[14:38:36] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, im not saying that it exists and therefore it's correct; i'm saying it exists and therefore there was someone who wanted something like it
[14:38:54] <kuudes> sure
[14:39:10] <kuudes> and I am not saying everyone should be archivists in order to be good person
[14:39:17] <pompolic> Gurkenglas: that's true. but it's one of the few areas where the defender has an advantage, mathematically
[14:39:23] <pompolic> the rest is implementation
[14:39:26] <kuudes> but I am saying if one is an archivist, one should take on that as axiom
[14:39:50] <kuudes> also perhaps one should not become an archivist if one does shy from that axiom
[14:40:02] <nshepperd> original paracosm don't steal
[14:40:03] <pompolic> another objection to my own point is, assuming whole-person simulation, they could also retrieve the key

[14:41:07] <nshepperd> First have an fai develop an  unbreakable encryption system for you...
[14:42:36] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, whole-person emulation as we're likeli to get it won't be able to retrieve the key unless your password wasn't randomly-generated-and-then-memorized; but they will sure be able to generate a good approximation to the distribution of paracosms you would invent :P

[14:47:26] <Gurkenglas> You identify with a basin of convergence in mindspace? Neat.
[14:47:41] <pompolic> ...i never put it that way but that sounds pretty accurate
[14:48:43] <pompolic> "simulate me, i dare you", as a strat
[14:49:50] <Gurkenglas> I advise that you remain uncertain about what exactly that basin is, since what you would decide it definitely isn't depends on the path you take from preformal you to the one that has decided
[14:49:52] <synthmeat> best defense against simulating is then living a schizophrenic life where you already think you're living in the simulation?
[14:50:09] <kuudes> even after the vaccines, I guess it would be 2% for me to get hospitalized

The Venetian authorities decided to rebuild it 'where it was, as it was', attracting much ire from the anti-fake brigade. A century on, it seems a most curious thing to protest against.’ Images: https://nitter.1d4.us/pic/media%2FE-Mmnz3XIAkNMlZ.jpg%3Fname%3Dorig

Apart from the

[18:11:21] <two2thehead> the current policy.  If Earth was taking the possibility of future pandemics at all seriously, we'd be storming to have enough mRNA vaccine manufacture capacity to go from completed design to vaccinating everyone on Earth in one month, just in case an actually serious pathogen emerged.

[19:50:03] <feep> but ... I only learnt later that I can't use the AC output on the battery pack while charging XD
[19:50:27] <feep> so I've been frantically googling around for about two hours trying to see if I could rig up a 12V to 48V step-up conversion to charge the scooter directly
[19:50:35] <feep> (the 12V outputs on the pack work while charging)
[19:51:25] <feep> technically none of this is actually necessary, mind you, because the battery bank has the same capacity as my scooter battery, so I can full charge with just the charge I bring with me
[19:51:49] <feep> but I would have liked to be able to charge people's phones there~
[19:52:14] <synthmeat> it's like it could use... pedals.
[19:52:21] <feep> synthmeat: my bike is in for repair
[19:52:57] <ggreer> why not just... prioritize your transportation over charging other people's phones?
[19:53:00] <feep> anyway, what I'll probably do is get to the park two hours early and just hang around on my laptop while my scooter charges
[19:53:38] <ggreer> also how big of a solar panel do you need to charge your scooter? don't those things have at least a 1kWh battery?
[19:53:45] <feep> then attach the solar panels for two hours, which should get me back to full
[19:54:25] <ggreer> so a square meter panel would get maybe 300W peak, probably 150W in typical conditions. charging would take 6-7 hours
[19:54:59] <feep> ggreer: the panel should give 80W if it's in direct sunlight
[19:55:03] <feep> it's rated for 100W
[19:55:13] <feep> but I know the scooter charges to full with 80W over five hours.
[19:55:33] <ggreer> a 400Wh battery? that's like... 4 laptops
[19:55:40] <feep> ggreer: I've been playing around and I can get 40-50W in the evening sun if I angle it right
[19:55:51] <feep> so I figure I should be able to get 80 over midday
[19:56:13] <PapuaHardyNet> is there a word for things you can't use now but would find very useful later but you need to remember their existence to use them - like the existence of EA funding, for example?
[19:56:14] <ggreer> I guess this explains why you need to recharge at the meetup
[19:56:18] <feep> ggreer: yep ^^
[19:56:27] <feep> ggreer: the scooter can *just about exactly* get me there and be completely dry
[19:56:37] <ggreer> does it have regen braking?
[19:56:41] <feep> yes but there's no regen here
[19:56:44] <feep> it's utter flatland
[19:56:47] <ggreer> ah
[19:57:05] <ggreer> get a grappling hook and shoot it at a car. that should charge your scooter on the way :)
[19:57:10] <feep> XD
[19:57:14] <feep> ggreer: I'll probably be there three hours early, sit around with my laptop~
[19:57:46] <feep> dump three hours of battery into the scooter, recharge over midday sun, then I can dump two more hours in the evening and still have plenty of space for people's devices
[19:58:15] <synthmeat> is this a picnic or a meetup?
[19:58:18] <feep> acx meetup
[20:00:18] <feep> ah, the one thing I need is a usb-pd cable
[20:01:49] * feep adds some usb 2 to c cables for people's phones~

[20:04:10] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I just want to say I *really* like ticktick. It feels much better than Todoist
[20:04:33] <PapuaHardyNet> also its free tier has less restrictions as compared to Todoist, and it costs less

[20:11:10] <feep> tiktik
[20:14:08] <Ralith> regenerative braking kind of sucks for lightweight vehicles
[20:14:57] <feep> Ralith: hi how do I convert 12V to 42V
[20:15:13] <Ralith> it's not very efficient to begin with and a scooter just doesn't have much kinetic energy
[20:15:29] <feep> tbf "a scooter with me on it" has some hefty kinetic energy :3
[20:15:36] <Ralith> get four of them?
[20:15:43] <feep> Ralith: sadly I only have three
[20:15:54] <feep> (12V DC outputs on my battery pack)
[20:16:07] <Ralith> what were you going to do with 42V anyway
[20:16:20] <feep> charge my scooter without passing through the DC-AC-DC conversion
[20:16:46] <Ralith> if you just dump DC directly into the battery you'll destroy it and/or your power supply
[20:17:00] <Ralith> charging lithium cells is complicated
[20:17:12] <feep> Ralith: the scooter has a built-in charge controller
[20:17:30] <Ralith> and it takes a 42V input?
[20:17:33] <feep> (I presume; since the 42V power brick is dumb afaict)
[20:17:35] <feep> yes
[20:17:44] <Ralith> wacky
[20:17:47] <feep> ikr
[20:18:49] *** Joins: inky (~inky_@46.162.252.15)
[20:18:50] <feep> anyway the 12V output in theory offers enough W to satisfy my scooter
[20:19:34] <feep> (12V 15A vs 80W on the scooter)
[20:19:54] <feep> but I'd need to add a voltage booster and they're scary ;.;
[20:20:37] <feep> all the amazon reviews are like
[20:20:39] <feep> "good"
[20:20:43] <feep> "worked perfectly to charge my scooter"
[20:20:47] <feep> "DO NOT BUY IT SET MY HOUSE ON FIRE"
[20:21:27] <feep> also 80W over naked cables is ~mood~
[20:22:31] <feep> Ralith: so in summary I'll probably arrive early to give myself enough time to charge scooter and also recharge battery pack
[20:22:34] <feep> but I didn't want to have to ;.;

[20:33:27] <feep> the battery bank has 320Wh, of which 20% will be lost due to conversion
[20:33:42] <feep> so I *will* need the solar panels.
[20:33:59] <ggreer> there's no electrical outlet around? I'd just charge that way. it seems like it'd be much faster
[20:34:07] <feep> it's in a public park

[20:54:49] <feep> is it safe to go with 1mm?
[20:54:53] <feep> or is it overkill
[20:55:14] <two2thehead> feep, re amazon reviews, those are some laaaaaaaaaaaaaaarge variance in reviews
[20:55:26] <rmmh> feep: it's about amperage 
[20:55:46] <feep> two2thehead: yep
[20:55:51] <feep> rmmh: ~2A
[20:56:01] <rmmh> That's 1.6A
[20:56:34] <feep> rmmh: sorry, 42V 2A
[20:56:51] <feep> I thought bigger was better but it makes sense if amperage is the key that less voltage means bigger cable
[20:56:59] <rmmh> 1mm is 18AWG and is safe for 16A

[21:38:06] <dbohdan> Oh.  I guess namespace has turned off registration.
[21:38:17] <feep> okay! conversation with parents has revealed an important note
[21:38:35] <feep> I *definitely* need 1.5mm cable for 12V 7A
[21:39:33] <Ralith> only 1.5mm?
[21:39:39] <Ralith> I guess 80W isn't all that much
[21:39:49] <feep> yeah
[21:40:01] <feep> I was going for 0.75mm originally, but that was looking at the 42V side, not the 12V side
[21:40:11] <feep> that would have ended badly P
[21:40:13] <feep> :P
[21:40:51] <Ralith> my DC charging cables are like 4AWG
[21:41:06] <Ralith> and you can feel em warm up
[21:41:18] <feep> 1.5mm is 16awg
[21:41:24] <Ralith> yes
[21:41:36] <feep> owait I see your point
[21:41:42] <Ralith> AWG goes backwards
[21:41:45] <feep> yeah
[21:41:51] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: Then I tentatively recommend the SDF instance.  It seems small, culture war-neutral (not on blocklists), and operated by an established highly technical nonprofit.  Tentatively, because I have barely used it so far.
[21:41:52] <feep> Ralith: I'm p sure you charge more than 80W tho, right?
[21:42:13] <Ralith> a bit :D
[21:43:24] <feep> Ralith: okay you think 2.5 to be safe?
[21:43:47] <Ralith> I forget exactly, but I'm pretty much maxing out the PCIe circuits on a hacked up ATX power supply
[21:43:56] <feep> heee
[21:44:03] <feep> that's still 12V?
[21:44:15] <Ralith> yeah
[21:44:25] <Ralith> internet says 14AWG is 6A max
[21:45:05] <feep> for "power transmission", I think that means more than a meter
[21:45:17] <Ralith> shrug
[21:45:24] <Ralith> it's not like playing it safe is unreasonably expensive
[21:45:52] <Ralith> prob fine though, yeah
[21:46:17] <Ralith> wires noticably heating under load makes me a little uncomfortable but it's within spec
[21:48:57] <feep> Ralith: what ampere is that?
[21:49:20] <Ralith> is what
[21:49:23] <feep> trying to crosscheck a calculator
[21:49:27] <feep> whatever you're pulling, idk
[21:49:40] <feep> I'm trying to reverse it to calculate your loss
[21:49:40] <Ralith> > I  forget exactly
[21:49:47] <feep> within +-50W?
[21:50:03] <feep> base ten logarithm?
[21:50:43] <Ralith> probably somewhere between 10A and 100A
[21:50:47] <feep> aigh
[21:51:09] <feep> and you have 13mm2 cable
[21:51:13] <feep> 20*
[21:51:45] <feep> hm. that's odd, you should not be getting much loss over that range
[21:52:01] <Ralith> I think it's 9A output at 50V or so
[21:52:25] <Ralith> so something like 50A in
[21:52:45] <feep> idgi
[21:52:53] <feep> you should only have like 0.7% loss at that range
[21:52:58] <feep> Ralith: um. how long is the cable?
[21:53:05] <rmmh> Headline:  Officials say this nest was much more aggressive than the nest encountered in 2020.   Body:  “I will say this, this nest was a little more aggressive than the nest we encountered in 2020,”
[21:53:12] <feep> rmmh: hahaha
[21:53:16] <feep> truth in advertising
[21:53:45] <rmmh> repeated style guide revisions: "remove the little" "instead of more, say much"
[21:53:55] <Ralith> length isn't really relevant, heating is per length anyway
[21:54:12] <feep> right right
[21:54:13] <feep> idk then.
[21:54:24] <Ralith> shrug
[21:54:25] <rmmh> feep: at such small sizes the exact cable type can matter too
[21:54:38] <rmmh> home wiring is generally solid copper or aluminum cores
[21:54:44] <feep> I'm just gonna grab some 2.5mm loudspeaker cable
[21:54:47] <rmmh> but cable wiring is often braided
[21:55:20] <rmmh> plus, measuring the cable diameter includes the cladding
[21:55:34] * feep flails
[21:55:52] <Ralith> yeah my cables are stranded
[22:02:41] <rmmh> feep: you're stressing out a lot about 80W here
[22:03:47] <feep> rmmh: I am! I want it to work out!
[22:03:51] <ggreer> yeah I don't think this much about any sort of gettogether unless it's in the remote wilderness
[22:04:28] <rmmh> last night I realized that my house is 5 miles north of Rocky Flats Plant :v
[22:04:56] <feep> yeah, 2.5mm and bought! let's do this shit
[22:05:08] <feep> I *will* have my scooter charging off the solar panel motherfuckers
[22:07:56] <Ralith> feep: I think the reason it's hard to find clear answers here is that the real answers are in the datasheet for a *specific cable*
[22:08:04] <Ralith> so, look at the materials for whatever you're buying
[22:09:02] <feep> well that's a centimeter too late, but let me check the spec sheet for the order I just made
[22:09:27] <Ralith> idk why that wasn't your first stop
[22:10:27] <feep> how do I actually find the spec aaa
[22:10:44] <feep> well it's a 2.5mm cca..
[22:11:21] <feep> that's probably bad, but otoh, 2.5mm should be overprovisioned
[22:14:14] <feep> looks like 1.4% loss..
[22:15:21] <Ralith> according to the specific spec sheet of the cable?
[22:15:51] <feep> this is a random amazon order
[22:15:59] <feep> I'm going by the typical cca to copper conversion factor of 1.6
[22:16:29] <feep> 1W over 1m cable.
[22:16:59] <feep> 1W of heating on a 2.5mm cable. is that an issue...?
[22:17:11] <feep> it doesn't *sound* like an issue.
[22:18:19] <Ralith> if it's not the cable's spec sheet it's not going to be accurate :P
[22:18:27] <Ralith> literally just went over that
[22:18:46] <feep> right, I'm handwaving, but I'm hoping to be within a factor of two. again, I don't have a spec sheet, because I don't have a precise type.
[22:19:03] <Ralith> you do have a precise type, you just apparently don't know what it is for some reason
[22:19:39] <Ralith> e.g. https://www.amazon.com/Welding-Battery-Copper-Flexible-Inverter/dp/B01MY9QVRI has a data sheet right there
[22:19:42] <Robomot> Amazon.com: 4 Gauge 4 AWG 10 Feet Black + 10 Feet Red Welding Battery Pure Copper Flexible Cable Wire - Car, Inverter, RV, Solar : Automotive (Amazon.com: 4 Gauge 4 AWG 10 Feet Black + 10 Feet Red Welding Battery Pure Copper Flexible Cable Wire - Car, Inverter, RV, Solar : Automotive)
[22:20:00] <feep> well, it's seki 2.5mm cca
[22:20:10] <feep> the problem is that seki's *homepage* has pretty sparse info
[22:21:58] <feep> so barring a spec sheet, I hit a wall.
[22:25:44] <feep> Ralith: anyway, it's close enough that I think I should be able to safely do a touch test
[22:25:51] <feep> ie. power up the scooter with the cable, see if the cable heats up.
[22:26:20] <feep> at these values, assuming no fraud by the producer, I'm confident it will definitely not immediately catch fire.
[22:26:52] <Ralith> yeah I'd be pretty surprised if you had any issues
[22:26:54] <Ralith> 80W just isn't much
[22:26:57] <feep> right
[22:27:04] <feep> OKAY ENOUGH OF THIS
[22:27:07] <feep> further experiments on friday
[22:27:10] <Ralith> standard USB C cables can do that
[22:27:21] <feep> yeah but more than that
[22:27:22] <Ralith> 20V rather than 12 but still
[22:27:25] <feep> the fucking battery can do that
[22:27:39] <feep> why exactly can this scooter not charge of usb-pd, epowerfun.de :v
[22:27:43] <feep> off*
[22:28:50] <feep> anyway, the 12V outputs can do 15A each, so we should be good there too
[22:28:55] <feep> strictly speaking I should buy a fuse as well.
[22:29:36] <rmmh> on second thought, let's not become electricians
[22:29:49] <feep> stick a ten ampere fuse on the plug as well
[22:30:05] <feep> meh
[22:31:33] <feep> probably create more risk by having exposed contacts.
[22:31:34] <Ralith> yeah my ideal battery setup would have an ATX plug and a bidirectional USB-C plug
[22:31:34] <feep> nice simple two core cable, split up, feed into screw terminals, be happy
[22:31:34] <feep> triple check the polarity lol

[23:32:50] <Betawolf> Do squares attract more cats than other shapes? I wonder if we just more commonly test them with rectangles and squares because our own species is square-obsessed.
