[00:51:14] <Guest91> Hello all. I'm hoping someone can help with a problem I'm having using git merge?
[00:54:29] <OMGOMG> !anyone
[00:54:29] <gitinfo> Usually, it does not help to ask for someone specific to help you. Without knowing your specific problem, nobody knows if they can be of assistance. Please ask your questions and wait until somebody speaks up.
[00:55:24] *** Joins: TJ- (~root@about/linux/staff/tj-)
[00:55:51] <Guest91> OK - the problem I am having is that a merge fails with error message "error: merging of trees" .. "failed"
[00:56:09] <Guest91> with several error: invalid path messages as well
[00:56:31] <Guest91> the invalid paths appear to be in the tree that is referenced in the first error message
[00:56:45] <Guest91> but that tree doesn't appear to be the tree that is the HEAD of my current branch
[00:57:05] <Guest91> so I don't know why the merge is attempting to merge a tree that doesn't appear to be the correct tree
[00:57:39] <Guest91> for example:  $ git cat-file -p HEAD
[00:57:40] <Guest91> tree 7b4b813611dd056fab2c2c779890ca515063e3bf
[00:57:45] <Guest91> this is my current tree
[00:58:03] <Guest91> but the message is "error: merging of trees 8e4e665a29cb5f5cd7c76cb111fd8e1c97ce76e0 and 574c3fcfb79d8573137f93f2c6cbe41b89b479ff failed"
[00:58:16] <betterOne> i did it :)
[00:58:18] <betterOne> for i in $(git status --porcelain | sed s/^...//); do git diff $i > ${i//\//_}.diff; done
[00:58:21] <Guest91> and I don't know why it's trying to merge the "8e4e665a2" tree
[00:58:47] <ZacSharp> what does `git merge-base 8e4e665a29cb5f5cd7c76cb111fd8e1c97ce76e0 574c3fcfb79d8573137f93f2c6cbe41b89b479ff` output?
[00:59:03] <ZacSharp> don't try, silly me
[00:59:14] <ZacSharp> the reference from HEAD is a commit
[00:59:24] <ZacSharp> the hashes in the first message are trees
[00:59:41] <ZacSharp> so the don't have a merge-base
[00:59:56] <Guest91> well the HEAD commit is a different hash that I didn't mention
[01:00:14] <Guest91> $ git rev-parse HEAD

[02:13:22] <fuzzybear3965> I want to edit an old commit but I want to remove some of the files committed in that old commit.
[02:13:39] <fuzzybear3965> My first stab was to `rebase -i` with an `edit` to stop on the commit that I wanted to edit.
[02:13:53] <fuzzybear3965> But, then I don't know how to remove some changes from the commit while preserving the commit message.
[02:14:24] <imMute> you amend the commit (the rebase stops *after* making that commit).  I forget the CLI way to do it - I like using git-gui for that particular thing

[02:15:38] <fuzzybear3965> So, imagine that I accidentally committed some files in an old commit.
[02:16:09] <fuzzybear3965> I'd edit that commit, stopping on it during the rebase process, then `rm unwanted files` and `git commit add -u` and `git commit --amend`?
[02:16:30] <ZacSharp79> yes
[02:16:30] <imMute> for removing whole files, yeah, I think that'd work
[02:16:36] <imMute> git rm instead of just rm
[02:16:41] *** ZacSharp79 is now known as ZacSharp
[02:17:00] <fuzzybear3965> imMute, why can't I just `rm`? I never understood that.
[02:19:03] <imMute> that has to do with staging / the index.  you gotta tell git what you want to commit.  it's weird at first not comitting everything you've changed, but it's an incredibly powerful feature (that I use regularly)

[06:13:53] <twb> blahboybaz: I guess you're talking about the COMMIT_EDITMSG file where there are comments that look like this:  http://ix.io/3FVU --- and you want to change the format of that comment?

[11:44:27] <geirha> with the former, the syntax is <user>@<host>:<path>. With the url form it'll be ssh://<user>@<host>/<path>  and you probably have to use an absolute path. Not sure.

[15:12:34] <Janni> Currently I always have a branch «master» on my repositories which tracks upstream/master (or origin/master) such that I can do things like `git log master..` etc. instead of `git log upstream/master`. That means however that `master` has to be up-to-date w.r.t. to the branch it tracks. Is there a way to make sure that master is always up-to-date or a better way to do this altogether? (Maybe s.th. like
[15:12:41] <Janni> master being an alias for upstream/master)

[17:30:44] <Dr-007> hello, im following a guide online to download an compile source code. ive used git before, but never repo. last night i was trying to download `repo init -u git://github.com/omnirom/android.git -b android-9.0` and it started and downloaded for a while. (android is very big) but after a while it asked for a username and password. so i figured, ill create a github account and create a ssh key and
[17:30:44] <Dr-007> link this to that account
[17:31:06] <Dr-007> but the `repo sync` is still asking for that password

I've taken some commits from WIP and merged them to master, after modifications (squashes, rewords...), by creating the feature1 branch. Now I need to merge a second feature, the commits are in WIP, but that branch contains "dirty" commits from feature1 (and the commits are not the same as the ones in
[18:13:15] <zoug> feature1 since I've done cherrypicking). Whats the best way to create a feature2 branch, retaking the commits from feature1, and adding only the commits that were not addressed from WIP? Hope I'm clear... thanks!
