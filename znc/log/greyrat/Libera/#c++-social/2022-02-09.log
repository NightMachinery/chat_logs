[14:02:22] <Carbonflux> just reminded what a beautiful world this is
[14:05:23] <Carbonflux> i was looking at games on Luna and found this game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_101
[14:05:42] <Carbonflux> you can control a horde of 100 super heros
[14:06:17] <Carbonflux> who does not want to control a horde of superheroes?
[14:06:37] * Carbonflux points his finger and shouts, attack!!!
[14:06:53] <Carbonflux> another perfect day
[14:19:01] <T`aZ> sounds too american for me
[14:19:37] <T`aZ> never liked the whole superheroes concept
[14:21:07] <Carbonflux> ya, superheroes get their powers given to them, powers that can be taken away.
[14:22:08] <Carbonflux> i mean in terms of playing a videogame, controlling a horde, not a team mind you, or a group, but a horde, sounds fun, most of all when i am in my cups.
[14:22:22] <Carbonflux> however, normally i like cultivators.
[14:22:57] <Carbonflux> they gain power thru meditation and life or death trials.
[14:24:09] <Carbonflux> but its important to understand something about Americans
[14:26:27] <Carbonflux> the idea of exceptionalism is more than just a national identity, its about cheating, some Americans, very few, but enough, can just break all the rules, most Americans are just going about their lives like most people. But a very few can open the dev console. We act like its a form of merit, but its not, its more like winning the lotto.
[14:26:47] <Carbonflux> people who can't do it are made to think they totally suck
[14:27:10] <Carbonflux> which is mean spirited imo.

[18:10:19] <MaNI> two hours of not having to work, sounds great
[18:13:56] <Crocodillian> are they zoom meetings
[18:14:31] <Crocodillian> you know what you can do, you can record a couple hours of yourself from a zoom meeting, and then just play that for all the other zoom meetings
[18:14:51] <MaNI> I'll take your meetings and you can deal with some of my shitty code for me
[18:16:59] <Crocodillian> no the point is that you play the recording for the zoom so you can work on your shitty code instead
