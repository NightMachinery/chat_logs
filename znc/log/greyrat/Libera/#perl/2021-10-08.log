[00:32:26] <nicoz-> there is no way I can show the bot every 5 minutes if there are new articles in the feedsurl
[00:35:47] <Grinnz> so Bot::BasicBot is based on POE::Component::IRC; you would put a timer into POE to do what you want
[00:36:02] <Grinnz> unfortunately this is much more involved than it might be with IO::Async or Mojo::IOLoop
[00:37:03] <nicoz-> very complicated?
[00:37:18] <Grinnz> no, just a lot to set up if you don't know POE yet
[00:38:01] <nicoz-> I do not know, if you can help me complete it, I would be grateful
[00:38:29] <Grinnz> the example in https://metacpan.org/pod/POE::Kernel#delay-EVENT_NAME-%5B,-DURATION_SECONDS-%5B,-PARAMETER_LIST%5D-%5D will do most of what you need
[00:38:30] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ POE::Kernel - an event-based application kernel in Perl - metacpan.org ]
[00:38:44] <Grinnz> you need to use POE;
[00:39:39] <Grinnz> there's no recurring timer inherently in POE, you just have it set a new delay when it fires

[00:42:34] <Grinnz> you'll want to do this all in the main package btw
[00:42:57] <Grinnz> i think if you set it up after you create $bot and before you call $bot->run, you can just use $bot in your timer callback

[02:19:14] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ Mojolicious - CPAN Dependencies Graph ]
[02:19:26] <Grinnz> that is correct, mojolicious has no non-core deps
[02:19:48] <phryk> tried different phases, also showing suggests & recommends, only ever get one box saying "Mojolicious"
[02:19:52] <Grinnz> change the perl version to 5.18 or something and you'll see deps
[02:20:06] <Grinnz> mojolicious has no non-core deps in any phase

[02:21:28] <Grinnz> core and available from CPAN
[02:22:46] <xenu> in simpler words, all of the modules that mojolicious depend on are currently in core, but in the past some of them were only available on cpan
[02:23:02] <Grinnz> heh, was just thinking i should probably complain if someone types a module name in the distribution box but it turns out i already made it look up the distribution and fix it automatically

[05:13:07] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[05:13:42] <Jonno_FTW> when I call system('/path/to/script'), $! contains the string 'Resource temporarily unavailable', does this mean the script ran?
[05:14:17] <simcop2387> did you check the return value of system()? and check $? to see if there was an error code?
[05:14:26] <simcop2387> you'll want to do those things to tell if it ran or not
[05:14:30] <Jonno_FTW> ok
[05:15:18] <Jonno_FTW> simcop2387: it returned 0, so I assume it ran correctly
[05:15:41] <simcop2387> yes i would believe that means it ran correctly.  i think it gives undef if it couldn't fork() by default
[05:15:59] <Jonno_FTW> then why does $! have a message in it?
[05:18:16] <aquanight> in many cases, some kernel system calls will not set errno to 0 when they are successful
[05:19:04] <aquanight> if you want to troubleshoot this I recommend either putting $! = 0 prior to your syscall or use a tool like strace to find the offending call

[05:40:36] <simcop2387> Jonno_FTW: one thing to keep in mind with $! is that it has the same issues as errno in C.  you can't always be sure that whatever you've just done actually reset it.  you have to check if it gave an indication of error before you can know it's actually valid.
[05:41:19] <simcop2387> i.e. you can't use it to check for success of something
[05:44:01] <simcop2387> effectively it is errno
[05:48:36] <aquanight> correct me if I'm wrong but... effectively nothing
[05:48:45] <aquanight> it *is* errno plain and simple

[13:36:29] <LeoNerd> For a non-duallife module like Object::Pad, I wonder how long I should keep the "since version ..." markers around in the docs
[13:36:59] <LeoNerd> I just released 0.54, and there's a few "since 0.54" or "0.51" and so on, that seems fine enough. But does anyone still care about something as old as maybe 0.24, from over a year ago?
[13:37:15] <LeoNerd> Perhaps I should keep a lower horizon on these as well and start deleting them when they've got old enough

[18:29:06] <krismatrix> Casual conversation. Many of you have interviewed with companies. I got a question where they asked me to solve the following problem: Given an image (you may assume grayscale), and a cropped image, identify whether the cropped image is in the original image. I had 30 mins on this. Have you had questions like this?
[18:30:29] <BLZbubba> sure, do you need to write code or just a pseudocode algorithm?
[18:30:46] <BLZbubba> you could do that with a recursive function pretty easily i think
[18:30:50] * ircuser is glad he doesnt get questions like that in interviews
[18:31:30] <ircuser> couldnt you read whole small image as array of pixels, and then check if same row of pixels exists in bigger image?
[18:31:32] <krismatrix> well..they wanted a working code, but there was someone one the call and we could disucss and talk it through
[18:32:33] <krismatrix> i started with a pseudo code a double for loop to solve it..and i may have gotten close to the answer...minus the screws up that come with me trying to solve spontaneously.
[18:32:51] <krismatrix> I mean the double for loop which is O(n^2) is probably a terrible solution.
[18:33:11] <krismatrix> ircuser: I am not sure you could solve it as a sigle dimension array.
[18:33:22] *** Quits: rorx (~rorx@cpe-65-24-160-111.columbus.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:33:23] <BLZbubba> yeah they didn't say anything about it having to be the most efficient way, you can add optimizations later
[18:33:31] <ircuser> just join them all into single dimension array, that's what I meant
[18:34:20] <ircuser> that wont work, because uncropped image will have extra pixels on each line after same uncropped image
[18:34:26] <ircuser> then I rest my case - it's unsolvable
[18:34:38] <BLZbubba> hehe
[18:35:10] *** Joins: thrig (~thrig@65.113.153.50)
[18:35:30] <ircuser> well still you can make 2d array of large image and then grep every line of small image if it exists in large image?
[18:36:13] <krismatrix> I don't know why you think single dim would work. If the image is 3x3, and crop is 2x2...and you convert them to single dim array it would become 9 vs 4. YOu still need to return the indices row and column
[18:36:30] <krismatrix> i mean you must at a minimum be doing something additional to keep track of that information.

[18:36:52] <BLZbubba> when you hit the end of a row in the cropped image, you would need to calculate how far ahead to skip in the uncropped image
[18:37:20] <krismatrix> ok...so you are keeping track of that somehow. ok.
[18:37:26] <thrig> or segfault, that's another popular option
[18:37:29] <BLZbubba> lolz
[18:37:33] <ircuser> kek
[18:37:36] <krismatrix> well..anyway..
[18:37:52] <ircuser> I actually had a code which was looking for empty lines in pictures and then cropping at those palces
[18:37:54] <BLZbubba> if (end of row) { cat /dev/urandom > /dev/vmlinuz }
[18:37:58] <krismatrix> didn't do so hot on that one i guess.

[18:39:08] <krismatrix> plus, i am pretty sure imagemagick is not installed on coderpad.io
[18:39:34] <ircuser> I guess you can always read raw pixel values out of a pic and use that
[18:39:56] <ircuser> need to be familiar with pic formats then which is a lot of work
[18:40:40] <ircuser> what an interesting problems ppl are dealing with
[18:41:38] <krismatrix> well..yeah. I simplified the problem to assume a matrix and the numbers represent the pixels.
[18:42:36] <ircuser> so I guess I could pull it off in a day or two, somehow either way it would find thsoe pixels in the larger image
[18:42:39] <ircuser> but god damn 30 minutes lol
[18:42:53] <ircuser> in 30 minutes flat I would only give you wrong answers
[18:43:12] <krismatrix> lol.
[18:43:18] <krismatrix> Apparently some people can do it.
[18:43:24] <ircuser> good for them!
[18:43:36] <krismatrix> or maybe, they don't want you to solve them, but show how you think.

[22:04:43] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'll check those for what they do. I might need to tell the release engineer we can't do without a bit of processing on the Perl side.
[22:04:51] <ehuelsmann[m]> (during the release phase, that is)
[22:05:09] <Grinnz> it depends what you have configured, as usual
[22:05:30] <ehuelsmann[m]> which is rather flexible on dzil's side, yes.
[22:05:35] <ehuelsmann[m]> thanks for the pointers.

[22:30:21] <gordonfish> Hmm, curious. I was doing a little cleaning and found an odd cable with common type connectors on either end that are strange to find on one cable.
[22:32:54] <gordonfish> 3.5 jack, male, on one end, (like what stereo head phones use; 2 rings), the other end is a 9 pin, DB9/RS232.
[22:33:16] <gordonfish> I have no idea what this might have went to. My current best guess is an old digital camera perhaps.
[22:34:17] <gordonfish> s/3\.5 jack/3.5 mm jack/
[22:35:45] <gordonfish> (The DB9 is female.)
[22:36:02] <pe> I think I remember having seen something of that sort.
[22:36:19] <Grinnz> i've seen similar going to a rj42, but not an audio cable
[22:36:24] <gordonfish> I wonder if anyone has any clue what might have used this type of cable combo.
[22:36:53] <rewt> gordonfish, do you have a samsung tv?

[22:37:47] <gordonfish> I've seen unusual combos before, like on higher end routers/managed-switches/T1/etc boxes that had what was physically a network port that took a table that had a serial connector on the other end.
[22:38:39] <gordonfish> rewt: Yes but this is not from it. I found the 3.5mm/DB9 cable in a box of stuff with other things from the late 90s.
[22:38:44] <rewt> maybbe go through this thread: https://serverfault.com/questions/491234/what-is-a-db-9-to-3-5mm-quad-plug-cable-used-for

[22:39:57] <rewt> if it's from the 90s, you probably don't need it any more
[22:41:19] <gordonfish> rewt: The photo in that post shows a 3 ring (4 conductor) 3.5mm end, like cell phone stereo headsphones + mic. The one I have has 2 rings (3 conductor) like stereo 'phones sans mic.
[22:41:31] <zgu> better question: what would an actual DB 9 look like, considering a true DB-sized shell has space for 25 normal pins?
[22:41:35] <pe> Oh yeah, this I remember https://pinouts.ru/DigitalCameras/olympus_d400z_pinout.shtml

[22:41:48] <pe> That was a horrible camera.
[22:41:57] <gordonfish> We used to have an Olymus way back
[22:42:01] <pe> It took forever to download photos.
[22:42:04] <zgu> oh, TRRS. i thought "quad 3.5mm" was 4 separate plugs
[22:42:09] <pe> And it wasn't reliable.
[22:42:24] <zgu> could also be some ham radio programming cable
[22:43:15] <gordonfish> zgu: Yeah TRRS is the ones with 3 rings + end tip, making 4 conductors.
[22:43:31] <gordonfish> (what most phones have used for a while now.)
[22:43:41] <pe> Tip ring ring shield.
[22:43:59] <gordonfish> pe: Yeah it was quite slow
[22:44:01] <zgu> although a growing number of phones use the 0-conductor version
[22:44:05] <gordonfish> pe: One tip to rule them all
[22:44:26] <pe> And the phones famously have two different standards for connecting the microphone.
[22:45:12] <zgu> good thing the included headsets always go straight into the trash, and the jack only gets used for regular stereo line out
[22:46:33] <gordonfish> pe: Yeah for a while it was apple did it one way, most others did it the other way. Why is apple always the stand out when it comes to conforming to useful standards...
[22:49:26] <zgu> because. they can do things BETTER than the other standards
