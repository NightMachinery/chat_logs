[08:34:28] <kristijonas> QUE on how you'd solve the problem: there is some simplified version of covid certificates in a form QR codes. Current implementation goes like this: A user verifies his identity and the backend database gives his vaccination, recovery or negative test status. For the recovery - 210 days, for negative test 72hrs, if vaccinated -- unlimited. Also
[08:34:29] <kristijonas> the valid until is no later than 2 months from the moment it was generated. It is signed with private hey and encoded into QR code.
[08:37:57] <kristijonas> Now, suddenly the rules are about to change in the end of the month, and people will only be eligible for certificate for 7 month after vaccination (unless they have a booster) so there is a risk that users will generate a certificate before rules enter into force and will have it for 2 months even when they no longer eligible for that.
[08:38:16] <kristijonas> A new key pair could be an answer?
[08:40:36] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[08:43:49] <byteskeptical> sure, you could require the previous key be signed by the new one after cutoff of old ruleset
[08:46:17] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[08:48:06] <maroon> other options: 1) simply have the certificate give the vax date and let the vendor figure out the valid-through date. 2) based on when the cert was issued, the vendor knows what the rules were back then, so they can recalculate the adjusted expiration dates
[08:50:24] <kristijonas> maroon, i guess that's how European certificates work.  National ones here decided to use a simplied version, basically not revealing if you vax'ed, recover or negative tested, only showing a valid until
[08:52:07] <maroon> then if the different statuses (statii?) shift by different amounts, then they need to solve the problem by reissuing certificates to everyone, or else the vendors are required to assume the worst possible shift in expiration
[08:55:22] <kristijonas> maroon, that's a gov agency no suprise they messed up. Back in summer, I asked them why I need to generate a new certificate every 2 months, they said: well, currently legally it's valid for unlimited time, but rules might change. The issue is that decision maker made a decision less than 2 month in advance before new rules enter into force.
[09:02:06] <kristijonas> as not so good at javascript, i'm not sure what exactly they use (which algorithms) to decode / verify certificate, but that's some functions here: https://paste.debian.net/1221917/
[09:06:23] <byteskeptical> seems to be https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3447#section-8.2

[09:09:21] <kristijonas> byteskeptical: thanks!
[09:13:43] <maroon> when i want to see what kind of padding is being used, i cheat by using modpow with the 'e' exponent against the signature to see what it looks like inside. i was surprised that openssl hasnt shifted over to using OAEP or something similar

[09:19:49] <ms7821> and I suspect the truth is it doesn't matter that much if someone chooses to squeeze 9 months out of their jab, few people are checking certs precisely, it's all about best effort
[09:20:55] <byteskeptical> maroon: perhaps due to the proof not being being quite up to snuff https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3447#section-8.2. I'm pretty sure there was a fix with slightly less rigor on the tightness
[09:22:32] <kristijonas> ms7821, right, here in Lithuania, they decided to have a separate covid certificates for few a reasons: 1) EU certs are mainly used for traveling, while national certs are used in places like convenient stores, so it would too sensitive information to show if a person it vaccinated and when, rather than a validity period depending on which category
[09:22:32] <kristijonas> (recovered, vaccinated or negative test) you fall into
[09:23:00] <byteskeptical> ms7821: maroon: oops wrong paste buffer https://www.shoup.net/papers/oaep.pdf
[09:24:07] <maroon> <shrug> even if the proof isnt complete, it seems reasonable that stirring a little randomness into the padding is better than a fixed lump
[09:27:19] <ms7821> wow, they're checking covid status in convenience stores in .lt? interesting
[09:27:20] <byteskeptical> maroon: in theory I agree, in practical implementation (thinking embedded systems and such) it may not gain you much aside from added complexity which opens more doors to implementation issues. I think a library as dominant as openssl has to weigh these decisions very carefully
[09:27:55] <ms7821> I do find it a bit strange that we're encouraging people to share qr codes with our full names on
[09:29:49] <maroon> to protect your privacy, the vax date won't be on this certificate which contains your name and that's required to show to stores even when you're not making a purchase :)
[09:32:19] <int-e> Like this, you mean? https://xkcd.com/2532/
[09:32:40] <int-e> (Actually that didn't censor the vaccination dates... pfft.)
[09:32:50] <byteskeptical> as someone living in a place with literally the polar opposite attitude to checking statuses, this is quite interesting
[09:34:15] <kristijonas> The Dutch validation tool which scans EU certs only displays first letters of your name and surname, even if QR itself stores your full name.
[09:35:08] <byteskeptical> int-e: lol

[18:52:17] <Wulf> IES (which we do use) is basically ElGamal encryption with symmetric crypto mixed in.
[18:54:25] <Wulf> neiluj: m doesn't need to be an integer.
[18:55:06] <Wulf> neiluj: and yes, you do need some mapping function to get group elements.
[18:57:52] <ioxzev1z> Wulf, oic, didn't know the distinction, assumed ElGamal was an older crypto standard
[18:57:58] <ioxzev1z> Heard it via GPG
[18:58:50] <Wulf> and I recently added it to a zero knowledge protocol. With IES it's hard to do zero knowledge proofs, but with ElGamal it works.
[19:00:06] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[19:00:06] <neiluj> Ok, thanks Wulf 
[19:00:17] <neiluj> Is there a canonical mapping to use?
[19:01:04] <Wulf> neiluj: Do you have a good reason to use ElGamal instead of IES?
[19:01:44] <neiluj> Wulf: I'm just implementing it for school :)
[19:01:51] <neiluj> Going to look at IES too
[19:02:14] <Wulf> neiluj: school? Then just do anything that appears to work.
[19:04:56] <neiluj> okay, so I'll just take the digits of the numbers and split them to get numbers that are <= characteristic in order to form an element of the finite field
[19:05:14] <Wulf> neiluj: that's horrible. Go for it!
[19:05:20] <neiluj> :)
[19:05:57] <neiluj> why is that horrible? hard to implement/computationally inefficient/whatever?
[19:06:17] <Wulf> might be insecure
[19:08:51] <neiluj> might?
[19:09:20] <neiluj> okay anyway it's not very important in my case
