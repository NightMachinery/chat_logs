[04:37:26] <slaughter> The issue I have with doing things like templates and generators is that the original docker-compose file needs to be the source of truth and not impose any overhead for devs. The script is for Mac M1 compat and that's a limited user set

[04:39:13] <w1kl4s> which makes sense since you're basically replacing your current interactive shell

[04:41:19] <w1kl4s> >Execute COMMAND, replacing this shell with the specified program.
[04:41:29] <texasmynsted> It takes about 30min to test
[04:41:34] <Blondie101010> texasmynsted:  that test will only tell you if exec is relevant
[04:41:37] <w1kl4s> so i think my explaination might make at least some sense

[04:46:17] <Blondie101010> definitely, I proved your point
[04:46:49] <texasmynsted> I think what I need is some way for my script to continue even on failure of the long running command. I think that exec would fail the whole thing. I think a sub-shell might be needed

[04:47:39] <texasmynsted> it _does_ prevent continuation?
[04:47:39] <Blondie101010> I usually only run exec to get an flock, or to play with redirects

[10:22:14] <hejux> it is strange, my tab is 4 spaces, but when i upload the file with 0x0 it shows 8 spaces. https://0x0.st/-Fag.txt
[10:23:20] <hejux> i don't know which part is wrong, cat file also shows 8 spaces in terminal.
[10:23:36] <e36freak> what file editor
[10:24:07] <hejux> vim again.
[10:24:13] <hejux> i shoud go to #vim for this
[10:24:22] <e36freak> probably
[10:24:35] <e36freak> but it has to do if you're using hard tobstops or softtabstops with noexpandtab
[10:25:07] <e36freak> or rather expandtab or noexpandtab is the big kicker
[10:25:24] <e36freak> but yeah, #vim
[10:26:27] <e36freak> :set ts=4 sts=4 sw=4 et
[10:27:12] <e36freak> vs noet, which shows tabs as 4 spaces in the editor but still uses an actual tab character there, which shows up as 8 spaces most places
[10:27:22] <e36freak> (which is also not a bad way to go)
[10:33:34] <hejux> e36freak: is that your settings? ts=4 sts=4 sw=4 et
[10:33:49] <e36freak> i use 2 space indentation
[10:34:01] <e36freak> also note that if you use et indented here documents will no longer work
[10:34:15] <e36freak> they need a literal tab character
[10:34:29] <hejux> yes, that was why i did not set et
[10:34:55] <e36freak> so then you get literal tab characters
[10:35:08] <e36freak> your editor can change how literal tab characters show up in the editor, it cannot change how other things show them
[10:35:23] <hejux> true
[10:36:21] <hejux> now i recall something. the command expand and unexpand from GNU, defaults to 8 spaces per tab
[10:37:38] <hejux> and google bash guide .. says never use tabs
[10:37:54] <e36freak> are you writing code for google?
[10:38:06] <e36freak> i just don't bother with indented here docs, personally
[10:38:07] <hejux> https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#indentation
[10:39:53] <e36freak> right, are you writing code for google?
[10:40:02] <hejux> no. i am not.
[10:40:09] <e36freak> then why do you care about their style guide
[10:40:25] <hejux> learn from them if they are useful
[10:40:39] <flying_sausages> Heya! Any suggestions for a reliable way to get date_modified of a file in linux and bsd-like environments?
[10:40:40] <e36freak> style is style, as long as it's redable
[10:40:52] <e36freak> style guides exist to provide consistency within a company or project
[10:41:03] <flying_sausages> the `stat` I have here does not have `-c`

[14:28:55] <Soliton> anyway as already mentioned a patch (with context) would be the next best thing. then there is some chance that mistakes get detected.
[14:29:50] <Pinchiukas> I haven't ever used it but hope the entire modification can be done in the command itself and won't require having additional files?
[14:30:34] <Soliton> well, that's about as much as i'm going to keep guessing at the goal and requirements.
[14:30:40] <gnoo> Pinchiukas: diff config.old config.new will give you the changes. you can then apply them using heredoc or on a separate file with the patch command
[14:30:42] <wstrnr> imho, it's better to have additional files
[14:30:47] <wstrnr> automatic generation of config files in a way that is uncontrolled by user (by a sysadmin) feels like a potential race condition problem.
[14:31:13] <Pinchiukas> wstrnr: where do you see the race condition?
[14:34:34] <wstrnr> well, in the most obvious thing: what if you open the config in a text viewer to see what's in it, the config will be updated without of any warning, then you will look at the version that will not match reality any more.
[14:35:32] <Pinchiukas> I get it after it's generated and the provider doesn't modify it afaik.
[14:35:59] <wstrnr> what else... suppose you edit the file a little and hit the "save" button.  if you are Very unlucky, or if the "updater" program is running very often and it's going to happen to run at the same time, and if it edits the same file (i.e. no new inode for a new version of the file is created when updating the file) there can be a situation where "updater" will write the first half of the file, then your editor will write the second half
[14:36:00] <wstrnr> of the file, so in the end the file will be corrupted

[20:56:19] <jelly> ruby also took a lot from perl
[20:56:39] <badmap> Hi.  How might one spawn a subshell without inheriting any environment variables from the parent shell?
[20:56:54] <emanuele6> !xy
[20:56:54] <greybot> http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem -- "I want to do X, but I'm asking how to do Y..."
[20:57:51] <furrymcgee> easy piping of different proceses in different languages makes shell powerful
[20:57:57] <phy1729> It smells a lot like xy, usually you just need to override one or a few (say LC_ALL=C) for a command or pipeline
[20:58:35] <jelly> I just learned about env -i
[20:58:55] <phy1729> yes that's a solution, but likely to the wrong question
[20:58:56] <jelly> and never had to use it, since 1994
[20:58:59] <emanuele6> that has nothing to do with subshells, but that is how you get a clean environment
[20:59:07] <Soliton> maybe that's what they're asking for. confusing to mention subshell though.
[20:59:30] <badmap> Okay.  I have a file with a lot of lines (only) resembling A=foo, and B="bar".  A .env file.  I'm actually looking to get each of those lines values, but without the bash-quoting around the values.

[21:00:15] <Soliton> if it's shell syntax then eval.
[21:00:50] <jelly> what does "without the bash-quoting around the values" mean?  would sourcing the file work?
[21:01:34] <phy1729> what if the file has other commands?
[21:01:35] <badmap> Sourcing the file loads them into the environment.  I want to get the key=value lines to STDOUT.  No double (or single) quotes.
[21:01:49] *** Quits: reallymemorable (~reallymem@70.107.110.8) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:01:58] <Soliton> sourcing does no such thing unless there are export commands involved.
[21:02:04] <badmap> phy1729: that is a good question I'll consider after getting a working solution, as an elective - but can assume that won't be the case here.
[21:02:11] <Soliton> this is still very confusing.

[21:02:57] <jelly> badmap, so you just want to get some input lines and output some of those lines, that look like k=v assignments, omitting quotes?
[21:03:22] <jelly> this doesn't have to do anything with variables or environment, then
[21:03:34] <phy1729> badmap: I'd be very tempted to just write a small parser; shell quoting isn't that hard and it obviates quite a lot of attack surface.
[21:03:56] <boreas> badmap: would it be sufficient to just remove quotation marks, or do you want the right side to be evaluated (variable substitusion, command substitution etc.)?
[21:04:03] <badmap> Soliton: maybe I'm using terminology incorrectly.  Given a foo.env file with the contents: FOO="bar" - running source foo.env - then echoing $FOO yields the value.  What do you call that if not loading them into the environment?
[21:04:21] <jelly> badmap, what should output look like for an input line like foo="bar isn't quux"
[21:04:25] <Soliton> it's just a normal variable assignment.
[21:04:32] <phy1729> boreas: what of foo="phy's example"  ?

[21:05:52] <badmap> phy1729: although 100% about the embedded quotes in the string; that's exactly why I'm not just busting out sed (although TBH with the correct regex, I could reliably enough do so)
[21:06:02] <badmap> phy1729: agree*
[21:06:08] <Soliton> an .env file sounds like it's supposed to be shell syntax.
[21:06:19] <Soliton> so eval/source sounds fine.
[21:06:51] <badmap> Soliton: brill - so I source the file.  How do I then output the variables it sourced (and only those variables) ?
[21:07:20] <jelly> I still don't understand whether k=v needs to go to stdout or needs to be assigned.  If it just needs to go to stdout, you don't have to assign anything anywhere.
[21:07:21] <Soliton> printf 'FOO=%s\n' "$FOO"  or something.
[21:07:58] <Soliton> # printf 'k="v\"a\"lue"' | grep = | tr -d \"\'
[21:07:58] <badmap> jelly: not looking to assign.  Just to write to STDOUT.  A decent sed expression should be able to achieve this, but I believe bash would have a more built-in approach
[21:07:59] <shbot> Soliton: k=value
[21:08:06] <rendar> `ssh host ls /root` is permission denied if i do that from my user, and `ssh host sudo ls /root` doesn't work, any ideas?
[21:08:12] <jelly> badmap, can you just delete " and ' from input?
[21:08:12] <Soliton> eval is so you do not need to write a shell syntax parser.
[21:08:30] <badmap> jelly: what Soliton said, pretty much :)
[21:08:44] <badmap> Soliton: I was playing with all the options we've discussed before coming here, but maybe don't quite have the correct incantation
[21:09:19] <Soliton> # source <(echo 'FOO="bar"'); printf 'FOO=%s\n' "$FOO"
[21:09:20] <shbot> Soliton: FOO=bar

[21:11:38] <badmap> Soliton: every variable in the file.  No more, no less
[21:11:43] <Soliton> jelly: do you see the example i posted above? that is not how shell syntax works.
[21:12:19] <jelly> Soliton, but they did say they don't care about escapes and security.
[21:12:41] <Soliton> but it's simply wrong.

[22:42:09] <earendel> serialization is the correct term.
[22:43:07] <badmap> IPC isn't necessarily involved there (but usually is, being bash)
[22:43:22] <earendel> that's how any interop works. (unlike when sharing memory access)
[22:43:48] <Soliton> if you want to put something in an env variable for another process it works the same way if a shell is involved or not.
