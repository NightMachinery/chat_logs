[20:48:04] <MatthiasVance> Hm!
[20:48:23] <MatthiasVance> 10 points to not reinventing the wheel
[20:50:04] <MatthiasVance> Is there a good way to use the code (full assembly instead of copying snippets) you're currently writing in FSI ?
[20:54:28] <MatthiasVance> I guess #r <path>
[21:11:18] <biberu> MatthiasVance: you mean like including source files?
[21:12:02] <MatthiasVance> Basically I am writing code in multiple modules that interact with each other that I want to fiddle with in FSI
[21:12:57] <biberu> ah, i don't really use fsi so I don't know, usually just writing regular console apps
[21:14:50] <MatthiasVance> It'd just be for tinkering and I don't want to pollute my solution
[21:14:59] <MatthiasVance> maybe I should write in LINQPad and reference the DLL
[21:15:58] <biberu> reference projects from solution a in a new solution b?
[21:17:06] <MatthiasVance> mehh
[21:17:10] <MatthiasVance> could do that of course
[21:17:11] <MatthiasVance> :D
