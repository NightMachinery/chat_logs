[20:42:13] <sparrowhawk[m]> <Notkea> "the OS of the nice but overly..." <- It's been a while
[20:42:29] <sparrowhawk[m]> I think @[Timoth√©e] has developer preview
[22:04:33] <Orbstheorem> This OS looks super cool ^^
[22:13:18] <Notkea> it's now fully publicly available, not that intermediate "source available to people who registered and have been selected after filling a questionnaire about their goals"
[22:28:01] <Orbstheorem> FOSS <3
