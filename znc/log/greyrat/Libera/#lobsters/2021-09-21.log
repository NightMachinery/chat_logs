[02:41:56] <kline> thinking about problems algorithmicly, breaking down subproblems that are more tractable, and building a whole solution to a problem is programming
[02:42:06] <kline> encoding that in a computer language is just busywork afterwards
[02:42:17] <wink> no, you can also start the other way

[02:42:42] <kline> wink, an idiot with lots of tools is plain dangerous
[02:43:09] <technomancy> learning that expressing yourself clearly is hard work, learning how to step thru a problem and debug methodically

[02:43:32] <wink> some people like bottom up, some like top down

[02:51:22] <kline> anyway, licensing commercial software design is a good thing, as is certifying the technicians who carry it out. both are different sets of skills and none of the above precludes people engaging in foss or tinkering themselves

[23:52:20] <kiedtl> Crazy that they're allowing fennel and janet though, imho. "Lisp" seems to mean "curly bracket language" these days.
[23:52:54] <kiedtl> (That said, I will be participating in it with Fennel+SDL2, time permitting. Fennel is pretty neat, just not a "Lisp" imo.)
[23:52:55] <Brekkjern> LISP has a lot of curly brackets?

[23:53:25] <fpsd> even Clojure is not only with good ol' parens :)
[23:53:38] <fpsd> but it is an ok lisp
[23:53:46] <Ticho> neat, so TCL is lisp too... who knew? :)
[23:54:16] <varjag> everything is a lisp these days, except the lisp itself
[23:54:34] <drakonis> oh
[23:54:53] <kiedtl> Brekkjern: Yes, but the main point of lisp is list processing, not just the curly brackets.
[23:55:07] <kiedtl> Anyone can write a dialect of C that uses S-expressions and call it a "lisp".
[23:55:41] <kiedtl> That said, the only lisps I've used is a tiny bit of SBCL, a few embedded lisps, so it's not like I'm super qualified to have opinions on this subject
[23:57:16] <fpsd> I've worked with Clojure for a bit and it is quite plesant, CL is impressive but quite big
[23:01:12] <varjag> "{:a 1, :b 2}" this is lisp nowadays
[23:01:35] <kiedtl> Kids these days.
[23:01:35] <fpsd> argh, that ugly comma...
[23:01:38] * kiedtl sighs deeply
[23:02:26] <kiedtl> Uh wait, fennel doesn't have that comma
[23:02:31] <fpsd> I really miss map/vector/set literals in CL
[23:02:32] <kiedtl> or is that another lang?
[23:02:43] <varjag> it's clojure
[23:02:49] <kiedtl> Oh ok, sorry
[23:03:06] <fpsd> yeah, the comma is optional
