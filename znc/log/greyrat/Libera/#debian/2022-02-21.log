[06:55:17] <karlpinc> What happened today that might have updated or otherwise changed something?
[06:55:48] * karlpinc does not know anything about sound but the <alsa checklist> factoid.
[06:57:27] <karlpinc> mannequin: You could also (as a random guess) try a newer kernel from backports.debian.org and see if that does some "better initializing" at boot.  Maybe settings are frobbed by some other os and not reset until you remove the battery or something.
[06:57:41] <mannequin> i got the latest kernel
[06:57:56] <mannequin> i did try the fallback one, same behavior
[06:58:04] <karlpinc> mannequin: See also the <pciid> factoid.
[06:58:19] <karlpinc> mannequin: "Latest" in what sense?
[06:58:31] <mannequin> the backported one
[06:58:38] <mannequin> 5.15
[06:59:11] <mannequin> it has something to do with gnome and pulse, not the kernel

[11:08:02] <frost-core> enyc : 11
[11:08:07] <frost-core> i need it to test
[11:08:22] <enyc> frost-core: aaah so it has a kernel 5.10
[11:08:42] <enyc> frost-core: OK so  debian10 (buster) (oldstable) has the kernel 4.19 by default
[11:09:00] <enyc> frost-core: simplest way for one-off-testing  is to manually download the relevant package file  and install that
[11:09:27] <enyc> https://packages.debian.org/buster/amd64/linux-image-4.19.0-18-amd64/download
[11:09:33] <enyc> frost-core: ^^ most likely what you want
[11:09:45] <enyc> that will be just the kernel with no  headers for compiling 3rd party modules, nvidia driver etc
[11:09:57] <enyc> and it won't be the default for booting with
[11:10:09] <frost-core> i use llvmpipe,
[11:10:43] <enyc> ok then you can add thea linux-headers-4.19.0-18-amd64  and so-on
[11:11:13] <enyc> frost-core: A trick you CAN use  is to add the full buster sources  in another file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d   so your system has bullseye11 and buster10 sources  TEMPORARIALLY
[11:11:19] <frost-core> im downloading the headers
[11:11:32] <enyc> and apt-get install   linux-image-4.19.0-18-amd64 linux-headers-4.19.0-18-amd64
[11:11:37] <frost-core> yeah
[11:11:39] <enyc> then remove buster sources from sourcese.list
[11:11:54] <enyc> its not properly supported (but often works) to have older releases in sources.list
[11:12:08] <enyc> you can have funny conflicts  or updates released first for older relasesa and messes

[12:52:52] <dpkg> [debian revision] a number added to the package number to show that the Debian maintainers for the package have had a number of attempts at the packaging.  The Debian revision is the string after the last - in the version (1.2.3-5 has a Debian revision of 5) and will also indicate a security update (e.g.1+squeeze2) or an NMU.  Ask me about <nmu> <binnmu> <compare versions> <version epoch>, or see section 5.6.12 of <policy>.
[12:52:53] <Khepra> fling: you'll notice fromt he changelog that -2 got "Apply upstream patches 001-004" compared to -1. doesn't explain what +b3 is tho, seems build specific and not source package version specific
[12:53:50] <jelly> +b things usually denote rebuilds without source change

[12:56:19] <Khepra> (so much so it begets new version identifier)

[19:02:32] <Khepra> duuude: the answer to your question is really simple: just don't install things you don't want.
[19:02:37] <bv> Debian's docker image is essentially a 30MB .xz
[19:03:01] <Khepra> might require rebuilding and changing dependencies so you don't pull in a thousand fonts, adwaita icons and themes and a gazillion of things you don't want

[19:07:49] <Khepra> technically all you need is libc, a shell, coreutils, a few core /etc/ things like passwd and shadow, and that's a working linux environment in a namespace. depends on external kernel, yes.
[19:08:36] <Khepra> I used to build microcontainers like that using gentoo's portage. that thing can really trim the fat, and create super-dedicated single (master) process 'tainers.

[22:37:15] <sussudio> you could just not use discord. it's lame.
[22:37:16] <somiaj> foehammer: There are multiple ways. I have installed the libs it needs from buster in bullseye and it works.
[22:37:21] <oerheks> 2 ways that make sure you have al dependencies, yes
[22:37:47] <greycat> why in the hell would anyone install a "discord app" instead of just using it in a web browser?
[22:37:48] <somiaj> foehammer: though I was informed that the dependency that is missing is actually optional. YOu can use something like equivs to create a fake package to satsify the dependency
[22:37:54] <somiaj> !equivs
[22:37:54] <dpkg> equivs is a package that enables you to create dummy packages that tell <apt> you really have installed (through some other means) the package.  apt install equivs, and read /usr/share/doc/equivs/*, see also <usrlocal>.  A better plan is often to adapt the Debian packages to your needs, ask me about <package recompile> <uupdate> <ssb>.
[22:38:32] <foehammer> I mean I could just use the web browser, but it is an issue with a lot of apts

[22:39:04] <greycat> You mean, proprietary third-party applications can be a pain in the ass?  Oh my goodness, I am so shocked.
[22:39:09] <somiaj> In general if a thrid party app isn't built for the debian release you are using, you have to figure out the solution for each one, what works for one may not work for another.
[22:39:35] <foehammer> If this does not work, I am not gonna use canonical stuff.
[22:39:36] <somiaj> sometimes the solution is you can't install it. Discord on the other hand, others have found ways around the issue.

[22:39:58] <greycat> Installing older library deb packages may work in many cases.  In some cases, you may have to scrape the raw .so files out of a Red Hat box and drop 'em in /usr/local/lib or something.  Don't forget to run ldconfig.
