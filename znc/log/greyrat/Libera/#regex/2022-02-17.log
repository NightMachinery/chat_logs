[01:49:19] <re101-jackal-74> https://regex101.com/r/aVwi3I/1 how to make this not avoiding to match "niger" , if it's possible? Working with golang
[01:49:37] <re101-jackal-74> "avoiding to match"
[01:50:29] <rewt> golang doesn't have lookarounds :/
[01:51:21] <rewt> probably have to extract it and check against "niger" as a string
[01:55:07] <re101-jackal-74> So I can't do it in the same regex?
[02:02:20] <OnlineCop> Your [g] character group is quantifying it with a single '+' right?
[02:02:48] <OnlineCop> Replace `+` with `{2,}` to only match if 2 or more times.
[02:03:10] <re101-jackal-74> I'll try in a sec
[02:03:44] <OnlineCop> Also, rewrite ([...])+  as  ([...]+)
[02:04:23] <OnlineCop> As you want it to return to you all of the letters found in the match, instead of reporting only the last one found (it re-clobbers the $1 group whenever a new [n] variant is found).
[02:09:41] <re101-jackal-74> the {2,} thing works:D ;
[02:09:45] <re101-jackal-74> so like this? https://regex101.com/r/aVwi3I/3
[02:09:56] <OnlineCop> There are two [g] groups; be sure it's on both.
[02:12:07] <re101-jackal-74>  this should be alright https://regex101.com/r/aVwi3I/4
[02:12:42] <OnlineCop> It looks like you also have one of the (...|...|...) alternation groups doing `[ea]*[r]*` without any single "required" character in there. That will always SUCCEED, so the alternations right after it, `n[o]+[g]{2,}|[a]*` will never get called.
[02:14:13] <re101-jackal-74> uh.. is that fixable?
[02:14:39] <OnlineCop> Do you want either the [ea] or the [r] to be required?
[02:15:02] <re101-jackal-74> I guess the second one
[02:16:09] <OnlineCop> Up to you. Change one of the `*` to a `+`
[02:17:23] <OnlineCop> Do you need the first [n]+ group to be captured, since the [ioa]* and [g]{2,} groups are not.
[02:17:39] <re101-jackal-74> ooh I see
[02:17:44] <re101-jackal-74> I'll try it now
[02:17:47] <re101-jackal-74> a sec
[02:19:57] <re101-jackal-74> alright yea it works
[02:21:13] <OnlineCop> Be sure to check through all the alternations that you don't have any other 0-length combinations in them.
[02:21:47] <OnlineCop> For example, that last [a]* group should be a `+` instead of a `*`
[02:23:10] <re101-jackal-74> yeah, I'll check them all and pute the + there; just a last question but it's probably impossible; considering this actual regex; is it possible to make it match also with for example "negro"?
[02:28:46] <OnlineCop> About the only thing similar between the two words is the initial `[n]+`. Everything else is pretty much custom.
[02:29:29] *** Quits: dandyn (~dandyn@user/dandyn) (Quit: Client closed)
[02:30:04] <OnlineCop> You could do a "(A|B)" kind of logic, to maybe reuse the `[n]+` logic, but it may just be easier to store each of those character groups as separate strings and then reuse those groups of letters in a programmatic way (construct the string by concatenating those together).
[02:30:24] <OnlineCop> Or copy-paste them all in. That also works.
[02:30:39] <re101-jackal-74> Can I still do this in the same regex?
[02:30:43] <re101-jackal-74> Could*
[02:31:24] <OnlineCop> Yes, doing the  `\b(A|B)\b` approach. I'm not sure whether the Unicode `\b` word boundary will always match all of those letters, though.
[02:32:03] <OnlineCop> Where 'A' is your current expression, and 'B' would be one to handle all the variants for "negro".
[02:32:53] <OnlineCop> You already do this kind of thing with the `(l[e]+|[ea]*[r]*|n[o]+[g]{2,}|[a]*)` alternation. You would just extend it to wrap around the entire pattern.
[02:33:59] <re101-jackal-74> Ooh I see now
[02:34:08] <re101-jackal-74> and that it goes by the same principle
[02:34:13] <OnlineCop> Right.
[02:34:14] <re101-jackal-74> well, thank you so much:D
[02:34:18] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.

[07:23:39] <digitok> \W represents every character that is not \w (a-zA-Z0-9_)
[07:24:06] <digitok> so [^\W_] matches a character that is NOT that, and NOT _
[07:24:11] <digitok> thus matching a-zA-Z0-9
[07:30:41] <klf> digitok, what if we don't have a \W ?
[07:31:36] <klf> so speaking about some arbitrary class
[07:31:40] <digitok> then just use [a-zA-Z0-9] ? tbh i did not read the thread though
[07:31:43] <klf> ("group")
[07:32:16] <klf> [<character list>]
[07:55:30] <klf> digitok, why is re.compile(r'[^[]') a valid regex?
[07:55:54] *** Joins: loganlee[gnu] (~Thunderbi@user/loganlee)
[07:56:04] <klf> shouldn't the second '[' be excaped?
[07:56:40] <digitok> inside a character class, [ does not need to be escaped
[07:57:15] <digitok> and outside of a char class, the same applies to ]
[07:58:05] *** Quits: txtsd (~txtsd@user/txtsd) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:58:34] <digitok> further, if ] is the first character in the character class, most flavours do not require it to be escaped
[07:58:54] <digitok> so, [][] would be a valid character class containing [ and ] in pcre, python etc
[07:59:16] <digitok> in js, it would be two empty classes since js supports those
[08:01:45] <klf> this nuance can cause a lot of confusion, especially between flavours
[08:01:45] <purplex> 61[^[61]
[08:05:54] <klf> If "inside a character class, [ does not need to be escape", then that means there's no nested classes
[08:09:17] <digitok> ah, that is actually one exception
[08:10:27] <digitok> in flavours that support it (none are represented on re101), if [ occurs directly after -, then it is treated as a character class subtraction
[08:11:15] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:12:06] <klf> example?
[08:12:22] <digitok> [a-z-[aeiou]]
[08:12:33] <digitok> to match consonants
[08:13:04] <klf> that's actually what I came in for.
[08:13:07] <klf> Nice.
[08:13:15] <digitok> there are also posix character classes such as [:blank:], but i am not sure that i would really consider those an exception
[08:14:03] <digitok> i.e. [abc[:blank:]] matches a, b, c, or spaces
[08:15:10] <klf> that would be a case where I consider as nested classes
[08:15:24] <digitok> and, to add to what you said a minute ago. i agree, and, despite the fact that i generally use as few escapes as possible, [] are ones that i always escape when helping ppl with regex because i think that it is good practice due to the exact reason you mentioned
[08:15:40] <digitok> i suppose you could call them that
[08:16:20] <digitok> in that sense, \w etc are also nested classes. though, they are typically referred to as shorthand classes
[08:16:42] <klf> in short, you want to help them learn about the nuance and not blinkly depend on the power of escapes (\)
[08:16:49] <klf> s/depend/reply/.
[08:16:54] <klf> errr..  rely*
[08:17:19] <digitok> yep
[08:17:44] <klf> nested classes involving '[' of course, since we are talking about the the bracket mess.
[08:17:57] <digitok> indeed
[08:18:19] <digitok> another one that trips ppl up even more frequently is -
[08:18:59] <digitok> inside a character class, it can usually be used without being escaped as long as it cannot be interpreted as a character range
[08:19:26] <digitok> but the rules around that can vary slightly between flavours
[08:22:45] <klf> well... there's  unintended benefit of using naively using the backslash... and that is to ensure compatibility across flavours :p
[08:22:53] <klf> what a convenient excus
[08:23:45] <digitok> unless you come across one that complains about unnecessary escapes haha
[08:23:51] <digitok> i forget which those are
[08:24:07] <digitok> most of them do not though
[08:24:46] <purplex> regex101's expression analyzer can easily tell you which brackets match where in most common flavors @ klf, it can also hint about whether you need to escape or not
[08:32:04] <klf> p = re.compile(r'[a-z-[l-q]]')
[08:32:35] <klf> p.findall("abcnk")
[08:33:57] <klf> digitok: character class substraction deson't seem to work.
[08:34:28] <digitok> few flavours support it, and python is not one of them

[10:41:08] <mysticspiral[m]> re101-duck-32: which operating system do you use?
[10:41:42] <re101-duck-32> Windows, I'm hoping to use it through powerrename which is the microsoft powertools tool
[10:41:53] <re101-duck-32> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/powertoys/powerrename#regular-expressions
[10:42:13] <mysticspiral[m]> i got no clue about this windows stuff
[10:43:37] <re101-duck-32> ok, thanks anyway :)
[10:44:59] <digitok> how is the current filename related to the new filename?
[10:45:20] <digitok> from your example, it seems to not be
[10:45:25] <re101-duck-32> oh sorry
[10:45:28] <re101-duck-32> that was a typo
[10:45:45] <re101-duck-32> I'm just looking to renumber them from 00001
[10:45:59] <digitok> :|
[10:46:01] <re101-duck-32> so dsc10238 becomes dsc00001
[10:46:10] <digitok> that is what i mean
[10:46:15] <digitok> those 2 things have no relation
[10:46:30] <digitok> i.e. the current filename is irrelevant?
[10:46:38] <re101-duck-32> ahh right
[10:46:46] <re101-duck-32> yeah the current filename is irrelevant
[10:46:48] <mysticspiral[m]> it just determines the order i guess
[10:46:55] <re101-duck-32> yep
[10:46:55] <digitok> but regex does not help
[10:47:49] <re101-duck-32> does regex not allow this functionality then?
[10:48:18] <mysticspiral[m]> you'd want to use something like bash, fish, python, perl
[10:49:22] <digitok> "Enumerate Items: Adds a number to the filenames being renamed."
[10:49:36] <digitok> seems relevant
[10:49:54] <digitok> just match every file in the folder and select that option
[10:49:55] <re101-duck-32> Is that from the link I sent above?
[10:50:07] <digitok> no, but it is from a guide on powerrename
[10:50:19] <digitok> https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/how-to-rename-files-instantly-using-powerrename-in-powertoys-on-windows-10
[10:50:35] <re101-duck-32> right, yeah unfortunately that option it renames the files like this: "dsc (1)"
[10:50:35] <digitok> they are using a different gui than your example
[10:50:50] <digitok> ok, then you can remove the () with regex :)
[10:51:07] <re101-duck-32> yeah that will work as a fallback :)
[10:51:10] <digitok> i suppose it does not give you your padding
[10:51:11] <re101-duck-32> was hoping to do it all in one go
[10:51:53] <digitok> seems like powerrename cannot really do all of that at once
[10:52:12] <digitok> a small script or such might be required
[10:52:26] <re101-duck-32> yeah doesn't look like it. I'll have a look at other options like Python for creating a bespoke script

[19:15:37] <karhunkynsi> switched :? and ?:
[19:16:29] <ROD> yeah i saw you changed it, why is that?
[19:16:44] <karhunkynsi> (?: is non-capturing group
[19:16:53] <karhunkynsi> (:? is a group with a optional leading :
[19:16:57] <mysticspiral[m]> funny typo; it works anyway
[19:17:04] <karhunkynsi> hehe, yeah 
[19:17:36] <mysticspiral[m]> in case you want to match :1234567,8
[19:18:25] <karhunkynsi> It would be good for that :D
[19:19:31] <ROD> im trying to understand it
[19:20:33] <karhunkynsi> ^(?:DECIMAL|INTEGER)$
[19:20:35] <karhunkynsi> Basically.
[19:20:39] <ROD> this should do the job, but if they changed sunddenly the requirements to accept two decimals too, what should be changed?
[19:21:40] <karhunkynsi> What do you mean, max two decimals /instead/?
[19:22:30] <ROD> i mean, it matches 1, 3 and 4 decimals. 8 digit total
[19:23:04] <ROD> what if they say they want to match 1, 2, 3, and 4. 8 digits total
[19:23:07] <karhunkynsi> Oh, it matches that as well.
[19:23:15] <karhunkynsi> There's just no test case for it.
[19:23:36] <ROD> i mean i'm typing this
[19:23:39] <ROD> 12345,78
[19:23:54] <karhunkynsi> That's not 8 digits.
[19:24:00] <karhunkynsi> 123456,78
[19:24:24] <ROD> correct, it has to be 8 max
[19:24:46] <ROD> like 12,23
[19:24:53] <ROD> but top, 8
[19:25:18] <ROD> it can't match more than that, sorry for my english
[19:25:30] <mysticspiral[m]> > trying to get one to match with a limit of 8 digit, with a comma anywhere between them
[19:25:40] <mysticspiral[m]> actually you said it right
[19:25:43] <mysticspiral[m]> we misunderstood
[19:26:08] <karhunkynsi> ROD> in total has to be 8, counting decimals
[19:26:23] <karhunkynsi> But no matter, we're on it.
[19:26:42] <ROD> correct, but 4 decimals max

[20:43:55] <OnlineCop> Up to 8 digits (with an optional ',' comma), or exactly 8 digits?
[20:45:22] <ROD> it has to me max 4 decimals, 8 total digits

[20:47:13] <OnlineCop> Why is "12,345678" marked under NO ?
[20:47:28] <OnlineCop> It has 2 digits + ',' + 6 digits = 8 digits total.

[20:48:42] <OnlineCop> "123456,78" is valid?
[20:48:49] <ROD> correct
[20:50:35] <OnlineCop> What's wrong with version /5 that was posted? https://regex101.com/r/qS60KP/5
[20:51:49] <ROD> bc if you keep input number in the integers area keep matching, has no limit
