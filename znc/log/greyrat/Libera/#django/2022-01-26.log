However, if invoke AnyModel.objects.anything() within the psycopg2 contexts the script hangs, no error, nothing, just won't go past the AnyModel.objects.anything() line
[01:11:25] <Kim^J> If I move the AnyModel.objects.anything() outside of the psycopg2 context, it works
[01:13:19] <Kim^J> I'm guessing the issue is starting another connection within the context to the same database is causing the issue.

[05:22:49] <darkpixel> Quick question on timezones.  Is there any way to force displaying times/dates in templates into the user's timezone that is stored in a 'USER_TIMEZONE' context variable?  It seems like the only solution is to add {% load tz %}{% timezone USER_TIMEZONE %}<template contents>{% endtimezone %}?
[05:23:36] <darkpixel> It seems like there would be a more DRY solution...I am calling timezone.activate in my middleware...but that doesn't seem to cut it.

[05:51:23] <darkpixel> Hmm...I just did some more testing.  If I override the 'dispatch' function of a ListView and I toss in timezone.activate(zoneinfo.ZoneInfo('America/Los_Angeles')) I get all my times displayed in pacific time...
[05:51:37] <darkpixel> ...but when I'm calling the same from my middleware, it does nothing.

[06:18:00] <darkpixel> Bizarre.  It looks like the docs are wrong.
[06:18:32] <darkpixel> There is an example here on creating a TimezoneMiddleware class: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/timezones/#selecting-the-current-time-zone
[06:18:40] <darkpixel> It flat-out doesn't work.
[06:19:04] <darkpixel> When I follow the guide to writing your own middleware here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/timezones/#selecting-the-current-time-zone
[06:19:40] <darkpixel> ...and I provide my own process_view() function...the timezone activates perfectly.
[06:20:12] <FunkyBob> wait... process_view function?
[06:21:05] <FunkyBob> i thought that was deprecated with the new middleware design...
[06:21:26] <darkpixel> It doesn't appear to be deprecated.
[06:21:48] <FunkyBob> well, at this point it would really ehlp if you'd provide code
[06:22:00] <FunkyBob> because we have only your word t hat y ou've done anything correctly
[06:22:07] <FunkyBob> and in debugging... trust goes out the window
[06:22:56] <darkpixel> Stby one sec.
[06:24:01] <darkpixel> Here's a quick screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/GQTlldG

[06:24:29] <darkpixel> If I comment out the "This does work" code at the bottom and uncomment "This does not work", I get times in GMT.

[06:25:20] <darkpixel> Sorry--it's been a while since I've had to copy/paste code anywhere. ;)
[06:26:00] <darkpixel> I don't think I've been in the #django channel for something like 9 years now...  Although I have to say... you were around back then too.
[06:26:33] <FunkyBob> well, it's no surprise the "this  does not work" part doesn't work
[06:26:41] <FunkyBob> you  pass on the request before doing any work
[06:26:50] <FunkyBob> line 7 of your paste

[16:24:45] <debnet> I need to retrieve all models which a QuerySet is passing by (through related, values or filters). I know this is possible to access internal query mechanism from a QuerySet but I don't know how to get the data I need. :)

[16:39:04] <pidroid> debnet i'm not sure to understand
[16:39:13] <pidroid> select_related and prefetch_related ?
[16:42:05] <debnet> pidroid: Here an example: I have the following QuerySet: ModelA.objects.filter(relatedb__field=value) ; Result should be (ModelA, ModelB) because I'm using ModelB through a related field.
[16:46:09] <GinFuyou> You can access related instances from parent one
[16:46:17] <GinFuyou> (and vice versa)
[16:46:49] <debnet> You don't understand. I just want to take a QuerySet and know how many models are used to evalute the query.
[16:49:03] <pidroid> you can see this with debug_toolbar of django

[22:35:06] <soxfoxrox> I am trying to create an object in views.py, and this object has many-to-many-relations. Is it true that I am not able to add these many-to-many-relations before saving the object, or is there a way to add them prior to saving?
[22:35:22] *** Joins: mattcen[mx] (~mattcen@2001:470:69fc:105::5d1)
[22:39:10] <GinFuyou> That's true
[22:40:35] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, is the solution then to add null=True to my many-to-many model fields in order to actually be able to save prior to adding many-to-many-relations?
[22:42:35] <GinFuyou> no
[22:42:59] <GinFuyou> If you mean to create related objects first, and only later set relationships, you can do it anyway
[22:44:04] <GinFuyou> or rather it's how it's always done, both sides should exists
[22:45:03] <GinFuyou> Technically you could create through model with nullable FKs, but then it's not quite setting relationships then and I'm not sure when it can be useful
[22:45:12] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, when I try to save now, I get an error like "null value in column "publisher_id" violates not-null constraint".
[22:45:39] <GinFuyou> Well, what is the problem saving instance first?
[22:46:38] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, when I try "title = Title(object_id=object_id, added=today).save()" in my view, I get the null value error above.
[22:47:21] <GinFuyou> what is publisher(_id) there?
[22:48:29] <soxfoxrox> soxfoxrox, well, publisher_id is actually a foreign_key... So are you saying: Add all non-relational fields, then add foreign keys, then save, then add many-to-many-relations?
[22:49:18] <GinFuyou> I don't see how it's related to m2m at all so far
[22:50:02] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, before, I didn't use save() when creating the instance, but when I then tried my m2m-field, I got an error saying I couldn't add it before I had saved.
[22:50:10] <GinFuyou> if FK complains it's none, you either should set it's value or make it nullable. I can't know which fits your case
[22:51:00] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, thanks. I will try to add all the foreign keys first and proceed from there.
[22:51:15] <GinFuyou> Well, again that's true, any instance has to be saved (given PK) before others can reference weither it m2m or fk
[22:52:17] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, but if I have to save before adding fks and m2ms, and these fks and m2ms are not nullable, how can I actually save?

[22:56:47] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, I guess what I don't understand from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/ is why the a1.save() in the example works...
[22:58:14] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, but I will try to add all non-relational fields before saving. Because maybe that's my stupid error.
[23:00:05] <GinFuyou> Article has only one relation field, which is m2m. m2m always can empty, it's be design, there is no relations with just having a field
[23:00:28] <GinFuyou> but setting anything to it before saving won't work
[23:01:26] <GinFuyou> a1.save(), p1.save() -> only then you can do -> a1.publications.add(p1)
[23:02:50] <soxfoxrox> GinFuyou, thanks for your patience. I'm pretty sure adding all the non-relational fields, then the foreign keys, then saving, then m2m, then saving again, will work.

[23:07:58] <Guest07> Hi I am wondering how I would make something similar to udemy's favorite topics form in django? https://dpaste.org/YB5Y
[23:08:05] <Guest07> https://imgur.com/a/Dm0V5lC
[23:08:23] <Guest07> I wrote my pseudocode for it but there are things that I am not sure about
[23:10:11] <Guest07> I want to be able to dynamically add/remove topics in my model and then have the template and form reflect that
[23:10:48] <GinFuyou> Subjects do not matter for current task?
[23:10:49] <Guest07> then need to somehow figure out how to make every topic name its own boolean field
[23:11:15] <Guest07> Not really I just put it there for context
[23:11:47] <GinFuyou> So, it's just an many-to-many field
[23:12:23] <Guest07> what is? The topic column I make?

[23:13:18] <GinFuyou> It could be either on User or Topic model, doesn't matter
[23:13:46] <Guest07> ok
[23:14:51] <GinFuyou> Then for form you just want a custom widget or manual rendering with checkboxes
[23:15:48] <Guest07> ok
[23:16:14] <Guest07> then the view would somehow detect which one was checked off so that the database could be updated with the right value?
[23:19:27] <GinFuyou> That's form job. ModelForm will just pick it for M2M field automatically if you set names right
[23:20:23] <Guest07> Oh interesting
[23:20:52] <Guest07> I guess I will give it a try then thanks
