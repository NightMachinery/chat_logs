[04:14:45] <dale> neosloth[m]: OK, I did some googling and I can't find much of anything.  The best I can find is one other person saying "I tried everything, never got color emoji to work in Windows" followed by someone saying, "Yeah, I just installed Emacs in WSL and ran it from there".
[04:14:56] <edrx> how do I make org not include a footer like "Author: Eduardo Ochs"/"Created: 2021-07-31 Sat 20:38"/"Validate" when I export to HTML? is there an option that I can include in an "#+OPTIONS:" line to control that?
[04:15:47] <dale> neosloth[m]: Next best suggestion is to install some other color emoji font and see if it displays in color, somehow.  Maybe Noto Color Emoji.  Otherwise I'm thinking Emacs/Win32 just doesn't have color emoji support, but that is a complete and total guess.  There might also be some build option you have to enable to get it to work, like building with harfbuzz or something, but this is just more
[04:15:49] <dale> conjecture.

[05:09:42] <bpalmer> config = config does nothing if config exists, and throws an error about a void variable if config doesn't exist; but attaching a pylint disable makes any python linters/checkers just pretend the variable does exist.
[05:10:18] <bpalmer> presumably, qutebrowser handles this by something like 'config = eval(config_file.read(), {'config': DefaultConfiguration()})'
[05:10:44] <technomancy> so like ... without that you won't get a reasonable error message?
[05:11:15] <bpalmer> without  # pylint: disable=E0602    , if you just ran pylint on that code, you'd get a lot of complaints that config is undefined
[05:12:26] <bpalmer> so you need (a) a line which references the undefined variable; (b) a comment to turn off complaining about any undefined variables on that line; (c) does no harm when it's run (when the variable is magically defined)

[05:26:19] <dale> bpalmer: I'm not looking at the QuteBrowser config, but I'm guessing it doesn't just wrap the thing in def _(config): ...?  That'd probably make the config more analogous situation to "extern struct Config config".

[05:29:22] <shrysr> technomancy: I'm wondering whether it would be hard to hit M-! or M-@ on the atreus? 
[05:29:37] <dale> Just that def _(config): ... would presumably also satisfy linters.

[05:30:35] <bpalmer> yeah. That would make perfect sense. I'm definitely not endorsing qutebrowser or even the idea of code as configuration

[11:52:39] <alphapapa[m]> just kinda putting 2 and 2 together :)
[11:53:13] <wasamasa> lisp-2 is slightly bit more convenient when it comes to naming a list argument, but being symbol-oriented doesn't seem worth it at all
[11:53:34] <wasamasa> I'm familiar with elisp, I have pretty much no familiarity with CL and occasionally mess around with txr
[11:54:10] <wasamasa> whereas there's a lot more usable lisp-1 implementations around, like scheme and clojure and picolisp and all the clojure imitations
[11:54:12] <alphapapa[m]> So only "list" vs. "lst"?  ISTM that it could be an issue in other cases, too.  And yeah TXR is really interesting.
[11:54:33] <wasamasa> as technomancy postulated, all new lisp development seems to be lisp-1
[11:54:43] <wasamasa> with txr being the only exception I've been able to find

[13:08:35] <alphapapa[m]> johnjay: Prism.el does that too, see this example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphapapa/prism.el/master/images/js-after.png
[13:08:36] <johnjay> because in practice usually you only need to know what are the sub-sexpresions of the current expression

[13:08:58] <johnjay> yeah i have prism
[13:09:18] <johnjay> but for most day-to-day stuff i like just having 2 sets of smart parens instead of 1

[13:09:41] <johnjay> so in |( (a b) (c d) ) there would be highlighting on the first ( and then on the (a and (c in a different color
[13:09:48] <alphapapa[m]> prism.el differs from rainbow-block in that the enclosing parens (or brackets, etc.) are the color of the list elements at the same depth as the list, rather than the list's contents.  I think it's more useful that way.
[13:10:23] <alphapapa[m]> also, prism combines with other faces instead of overriding them, so you still get bold/italic/etc. from other font-lock faces
[13:10:31] *** Joins: haj (~haj@ip5f5beb42.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[13:10:56] <johnjay> yes it's useful for some cases but i wouldn't say i use prism every day
[13:11:52] <alphapapa[m]> something I've noticed is that, when I look at code in a different highlighting scheme, sometimes I see things in code that I hadn't noticed before, so sometimes I read my code again, e.g. as rendered by GitHub

[13:12:30] <johnjay> what's an example of the kind of thing you might notice in that case
[13:13:53] <alphapapa[m]> hm, I don't know if I can give a concrete answer to that.  I think it's more like, it puts me in a different frame of mind when I use a different highlighting scheme than the one I use when writing code, so maybe, e.g. I don't skip over parts that I've seen many times before, so I think about them more carefully, and then I think of things that I need to do with regard to that code
[13:14:43] <alphapapa[m]> sort of like, if I  write some prose, then set it down, and read it again a few days later, I see edits that need to be made, ones that I overlooked just after writing it
[13:14:49] <rnkn> alphapapa[m]: what was the imenu-everywhere thing you mentioned?
[13:15:26] <alphapapa[m]> rnkn: well, e.g. if I have several Elisp files open from the same project, I can use imenu-anywhere to jump to definitions in other files in the project, rather than having to remember which file that's in and go to that file's buffer first

[17:40:55] <twb> bremner: because if matrix user A is in #emacs, then user B joins the same matrix server, they get full access to old messages seen by A.
[17:41:15] <bremner> people who feel strongly about this issue should pursue it.
[17:41:26] <bremner> aka Patches Welcome.
[17:41:32] <twb> I don't think it's fixable
[17:41:36] <kevin``> why are people so against public logging?
[17:41:40] <thomasb06> it's called a bouncer to access old messages?
[17:42:01] <twb> kevin``: because it has a chilling effect if you say something bad about your boss and then she google's it 5 years later

[17:50:51] <twb> If matrix could actually implement Chatham House that would be 90% good solution all around, I think
[17:51:08] <hmw> I guess the keyword is _public_ logging. Noone hinders one to have a private log or to extract information from #emacs and produce a tutorial from that, I think.
[17:51:26] <twb> hmw: right which is why operating a personal matrix server is totally fine
[17:51:26] <bremner> hmw: right. but people new to IRC find this a burden
[17:51:57] <hmw> twb: I think so, yes.
[17:52:24] <kevin``> twb: I understand that, but how many times have people had to come here to re-ask a question that's already been answered (or answered before by someone who's no longer around so the question remains unanswered and causes someone to abandon emacs just because someone doesn't want to switch rooms to rant about someone/something)?
[17:52:55] <hmw> bremner: Maybe, yes. 
[17:52:56] <twb> fsbot maintains instutitional knowledge
[17:52:59] <bremner> kevin``: in fairness, re-asking your question would have been less work than this discussion
[17:53:10] <edgar-rft> kevin``: the call-process vs. start-process question? II still have the logs here but I can't see any answer to that question.
[17:53:15] <twb> bremner: I think they're concerned about a HYPOTHETICAL question
[17:53:27] <bremner> someone found a hill to die on
[17:53:37] <kevin``> bremner: yeah, except for now I'm having difficulty re-finding the snippet of code it was about
[17:54:05] <hmw> Imagine we would have a log of the channel, would someone really grep 80MB (or whatever the size is) of text for a solution to a given problem? I don't think so.
[17:54:11] <twb> bremner: we get SO MANY people on ##english who are like "my language only has males and females therefore non-binary people cannot exist and singular they is fundamntally wrong"

[17:55:05] <twb> bremner: but yeah the analogy to current discussion is unfair
[17:55:58] <twb> hmw: I have done that occasionally, but by comparison, lots of web forums are publicly logged and their google-result usefulness is pretty much zero
[17:58:20] <edgar-rft> surprisingly I agree with twb
[17:59:37] <hmw> I'm guilty, too. But in most cases I was quite sure that the solution I'm looking for is in the logs. I can feel the pain with web forums. I'm still kind of a fan of usenet: I can grep the groups, use the search function of the news client and I can do all that when I'm off-line.

[18:27:22] <MysteriousSilver> this was the error

[18:29:11] <schillingklaus> bpalmer is still around in the wild
[18:29:14] <kevin``> twb: sxemacs still has a bit of active development going on
[18:29:38] <twb> kevin``: looking at your original code, my best guess is just that xemacs is slower
[18:29:45] <kevin``> twb: I guess what really killed it is org-mode not getting ported (to th ebest of my knowledge) 
[18:29:47] <MysteriousSilver> alphapapa[m]: https://bpa.st/PD5A
[18:30:33] <twb> IMO what killed xemacs was GNU Emacs getting color support.   And X11.
[18:30:34] <kevin``> twb: I wouldn't say that.  In fact, I always preferred it.  It's just that fsf emacs is the 900 lb gorilla cuz so few people migrated to xemacs
