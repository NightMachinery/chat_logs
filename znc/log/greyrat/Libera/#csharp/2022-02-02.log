[00:33:12] <_genuser_> jmer had to get on a call. But right, I think agile can get to the point of scrum master wanting to know exactly what's going on etc. If you have a task, you have to specifically build in time for research and if not, you have to explain why things aren't done. whereas you can always be on time for the actual deliverables, during the process it can
[00:33:12] <_genuser_> cause a lot of issues.

[03:45:24] <Suchiman> Slade: haha
[03:45:28] <Suchiman> bitch
[03:45:58] <Suchiman> Slade: then again, 100€ fine lol
[03:46:32] <Slade> Suchiman: yes. its a weird situation, germany is on a common law system right?
[03:47:05] <Slade> ah no, civil law
[03:48:33] <Suchiman> Slade: you can only violate written law, not things considered over time to be a rule turning into a law
[03:48:47] <Slade> very unamerican of you
[03:49:12] <Slade> the next time it happens, probably not 100.. but since it was completely obvious that the person didnt intend damages or even considered it damaging, it was probably small
[03:49:16] <Suchiman> although precedent decisions might be sometimes used when the written law is unclear or leaves room for interpretation
[03:49:18] <Slade> now everyone has no excuse
[04:06:12] <Suchiman> law's that leave room for interpretation might be decided one way or another depending on court but if somebody is unhappy with the decision and fights it up to the supreme court, the ruling made there is used as a guideline for similiar cases usually, although courts have the freedom to make their own ruling (although if that decision is not in your favor you will likely be able to bring the case to the supreme court to have it overruled)

[05:17:35] <khanred> what if I don't believe in laws?
[05:17:36] <jonp> "common law" is 2 degrees of separation from Jewish law & Muslim law; does that mean anything?
[05:18:04] <jonp> i also find it odd that muslim law has nothing to do with jewish law?

[05:30:02] <Slade> jonp: i'm surprised your first question wasnt 'what up with LA'
[05:30:48] <Slade> tho the fact it LA and Quebec might make it obvious
[05:31:09] <jonp> the answer to "what's up with LA" is "France"
[05:31:17] <jonp> ditto Quebec
[05:31:39] <jonp> the "real" question is, why isn't France like France anymore?
[05:31:50] <Slade> federally theyre common law, state/provincially they're roman law
[05:32:08] <jonp> i thought they were a form of Civil law, actually
[05:32:16] <Slade> err, civil law = roman law
[05:32:21] <jonp> but that image places them 1 degree away from civil law
[05:32:27] <jonp> between civil & common
[05:32:36] <jonp> which, again, *i don't know what that means*
[05:32:44] <jonp> that image doesn't actually answer anything
[05:33:06] <Slade> the image shows civil law to me for france? with the N for napolean
[05:33:23] <jonp> oh, right; "Napoleanic law"
[05:33:33] <jonp> which i just mentally replaced with "France"
[05:33:37] <jonp> 'cause…France
[05:37:05] <Slade> unrelated http://www.moonsulfab.info/   reading this guys bio.. is it bad that i recognize the image source code as coming from doom?
[05:37:21] <jonp> that sounds awesome, actually?
[05:37:27] <jonp> recognizing where source came from?
[05:37:57] <jonp> that's a hell of a resume
[05:38:49] <jonp> though…why would he have image code from Doom as a background image?
[05:39:10] <Slade> yea. he's on mitch mcconnells staff.
[05:39:13] <jonp> that's very weird and offputting
[05:39:22] <jonp> ok, even worse
[05:40:01] <Slade> the image probably looks all cool and high techy to random plebs but if since i know what the image is from.. i'm like.............
[05:40:25] <jonp> especially since nothing in his bio suggests "i wrote doom"
[05:41:14] <Slade> and in fairness it could be quake 1.. but i think its doom
[05:41:26] <jonp> fine; doesn't matter.
[05:41:34] <jonp> *nothing* in that bio screams "i ever worked in games"
[05:41:41] <jonp> especially when his career starts in 2007
[05:41:49] <jonp> and doom/quake/whatever are the '90s

[10:53:58] <MichaelLong> would do alot of sports to exhaust him between meetings and sprints and stuff
[10:54:03] <MichaelLong> :P
[10:54:14] <jmer> I  can't do sports at work
[10:54:28] <MichaelLong> I was joking :> but we did it at school
[10:54:31] <jmer> There is no shower and I just have to run for 10 min. then I'm Sweaty McSweat
[10:55:05] <jmer> It would probably be healthy for everyone talking a nice walk after lunch...
[10:55:11] <jmer> maybe I should start practicing that
[10:55:29] <MichaelLong> it is an intenship, so it is good time to find out how he is. every person on a "spectrum" is different
[10:55:47] <jmer> Yeah no doubt
[10:56:27] <MichaelLong> e.g. when I had to take care of one of the ADHD kids in elementary school, some of the "normal" kids acted for worse than the one I had to observe
[10:56:38] <MichaelLong> *far worse
[10:57:25] <jmer> I am not worried about the spectrum part
[10:57:31] <jmer> I am worried we might not get to keep him
[10:57:45] <jmer> and then it's a sunk cost... Because it will take us at least a year to get him up and running
[10:57:55] <MichaelLong> hmm
[10:58:06] <jmer> Well ok maybe not "at least"
[10:58:15] <jmer> but we might spend 6-8 months teaching him, making him feel safe etc
[10:58:32] <jmer> then it would suck we could only keep him for 1 year
[10:58:37] <MichaelLong> but how long does the internship period lasts?
[10:58:40] <jmer> but my manager said the PLAN is to hire him afterwards if he's a fit
[10:58:43] <jmer> 1 year
[10:58:48] <MichaelLong> oh
[10:59:01] <MichaelLong> I assumed something like 1 month or so
[10:59:17] <jmer> up to 1 year of internship I guess we can make it shorter but I don't think that makes sense
[10:59:51] <jmer> it's important to me that he gets a positive learning experience out of this...
[10:59:58] <jmer> I would rather say no than being forced to half-arse it
[11:01:44] <MichaelLong> I don't agree that it does not make sense. there is for one to find out if the adhd is a problem and there is also the technical side. and an internship is not an apprenticeship
[11:02:30] <MichaelLong> if it is not a fit, one should be able to bail out quickly. that's good for both sides

[12:23:25] <JakeSays> Jong: i think absolutely nothing about it. what they do is irrelevant.

[12:24:05] <JakeSays> what solves the problems/business needs at hand

[12:24:39] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Because before I bought them for noise reduction and easy leveling etc. Now I found out that's hardly needed.
[12:24:56] <JakeSays> noise reduction isn't needed?

[12:26:48] <jmer> But the whatever OS vs Whatever OS or whatever programming language vs other language has been done to death here
[12:27:38] <Jong> JakeSays because if more OS's used the same or similar commands it would make knowledge more transferrable, instead of learning one thing here, and then all that learning being useless when switching jobs and needing to learn something else.
[12:28:01] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Because it's in my attic now :D
[12:28:14] <JakeSays> Jong: if everything you learn developing for windows becomes useless on linux then you're a shitty engineer.
[12:28:17] <jmer> Jong: are you aware of WSL? Or that you can install powershell on unixlikes
[12:28:27] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: ah right
[12:28:41] <jmer> also my bash experience translated nicely to git bash on windows
[12:28:55] <Jong> JakeSays  well, having memorized find . -name "searchstring" isn't transferrable. I need to learn another command
[12:29:18] <jmer> bash runs on windows?
[12:29:18] <JakeSays> Jong: so? just learn it
[12:29:29] <JakeSays> it's not a world ending thing
[12:29:59] <Jong> JakeSays  if different places use the same tools, you can reuse knowledge on how to use the tool. If they use different tools, you must learn anew.   That's overhead compared to already knowing how to use the tool
[12:30:20] <MatthiasVance> What is "different places"?
[12:30:21] <JakeSays> it's marginal overhead at worst.
[12:30:23] <MatthiasVance> Different jobs?
[12:30:29] <MatthiasVance> Because if so, you have a choice there.
[12:30:41] <JakeSays> when hiring i don't give a shit about what tools a dev knows.
[12:30:46] <Jong> for sure. people like hiring folks who are using the tools they are
[12:31:00] <MatthiasVance> They have to know Excel JakeSays .. you're biggest competitor is always an overengineered Excel sheet :P

[12:33:21] <JakeSays> LOL
[12:41:04] <Lizard_> governement employees are some of the dumbest motherfucker on this planet... their service was shutdown/crashed yesterday a 7:30 pm... wake up call their retard in charge to fix their shit... an hour later they call me bitching data is delayed... If I could I would have strangled her through the phone
[12:41:48] <jmer> Lizard_: I'm ashamed to admit it, but that's also my impression of government employees... :/
[12:43:26] <jmer> Lizard_: and here, for some reason they use that as an excuse to hire overpriced consultants.
[12:44:19] <Lizard_> the consultants are the only working while they have a development team of 50 that takes 2 months to change and deploy one line of code
[12:44:54] <jmer> Lizard_: here they save money on the internal IT employees because it's "too expensive" and then they hire consultants for almost permanent positions
[12:45:38] <JakeSays> consultants are almost always cheaper
[12:46:30] <jmer> JakeSays: Not when you need them because you don't want to hire internal staff
[12:46:46] <JakeSays> they're cheaper than internal staff
[12:46:47] <jmer> Paying for a consultant for 1 year vs. having an employee for one year, the consultant will be a lot more expensive
[12:46:52] <JakeSays> almost always
[12:46:56] <JakeSays> nooo
[12:47:13] <jmer> a consultant will bill you 190€ pr hour
[12:47:44] <JakeSays> consultants also come out of a different budget so there are additional tax benefits
[12:47:55] <Lizard_> and the "super duper" consultants is a intern at CGI with a college degree from India... costing $90/h
[12:48:00] <jmer> there's  no tax benefits when it's the government JakeSays
[12:48:17] <JakeSays> ah govt.
[12:48:35] <JakeSays> well, there aren't tax benefits, but there are other substantial benefits
[12:49:03] <jmer> JakeSays: I have yet to see them, all of the several billion projects done in .gov here in Denmark have been delayed and over budget
[12:49:07] <JakeSays> consultants still usually come under a different budget
[12:49:07] <jmer> and shitty
[12:49:20] <jmer> having to be redone in less than 10 years, by other shitty consultants
[12:49:21] <JakeSays> well, you probably wouldn't see them
[12:49:43] <jmer> JakeSays: They made an electronic "travel card" for public transport
[12:49:57] <jmer> JakeSays: the company hired "recommended" to write it from scratch because nothing existing could be used...
[12:50:01] <Lizard_> every other month I need to get in a shouting match with their admin who put back a throttle on us when we represent 90% of this system usage state wide...
[12:50:21] <jmer> And now we have a subpar shitty public transport travel card that is cumbersome, hard to use and... frankly only 10-15% cheapr than owning your own car
[12:50:28] <Lizard_> "You ducking too much juice", 24 hours later "data is delayed"
[12:50:30] <Lizard_> fuck heads
[12:50:56] <JakeSays> jmer: govt's, like most companies, don't look forward very far

[14:59:51] <interop_madness> jmer, in my opinion it goes with stratified societies in general. same kind of problem exists with the nomenklatura in socialist/communist countries
[15:00:02] <Lizard_> "Because of capitalism"
[15:00:07] <Lizard_> commies are barelly humans
[15:00:34] <jmer> Lizard_: I see myself as a liberalist but unregulated capitalism is bad.
[15:00:46] <interop_madness> that's not an argument against stratified societies in general, though. I think that's the price we pay for it and the job of society is to seek to minimize these instances
[15:00:54] <jmer> I don't know what a stratified society is
[15:01:42] <jmer> I googled it and I now know
[15:03:14] <jmer> mind you, I am not saying social inequality is a bad thing. But when there are secret benefits for specific people in terms of social mobility or creation of monopolies that's bad for society in general
[15:03:15] <interop_madness> I'm oscillating between anarchocapitalism and communism, based on what we are talking about^^ trying to open a small business? the state should be a small interfering factor for you. your business has become so big that it now has utility status? eminent domain time!

[15:07:34] <interop_madness> Almost all my political positions would be left to some extent, economically or socially, but the woke, guilt-tripping culture that presents itself in society instills a seething hate in me. And I mean ACTUAL hate.
[15:08:00] <interop_madness> I will NEVER again vote for a left party, unless they take extreme and overzealously brutal measures against any woke agenda
[15:10:13] <jmer> interop_madness: at least here in denmark the left wing is more and more catering to people who doesn't want to be responsible for their own life choices and wants the .gov to "help" them or "fix stuff"

[16:36:14] <Tobbi_> Coworker of mine invests in crypto. He actually sold Dogecoin after like 1 week...and invested into another currency.

[16:41:55] <ASUS> crypto is not environmentally friendly
[16:42:05] <jmer> that too.
[16:42:09] <ASUS> 1% of world electricity is wasted on SHA sums
[16:42:14] <ASUS> for no reason
[16:42:23] <Lizard_> yeah because Visa datacenter is super environment friendly
[16:42:31] <ASUS> better than crypto
[16:42:57] <interop_madness> visa processes like a million times more tx/sec than btc?

[17:21:10] <jmer> I tried battlestar galactica... I enjoyed the first season but then it just became fucking weird

[17:22:43] <jmer> Is babylon 5 streamed anywhere?

[17:26:11] <jmer> Farscape is too far out there in terms of space flight
[17:26:21] <jmer> it's closer to magic than anything even remotely believable
[17:26:48] <jmer> "living spaceships"... Dumb concept imho

[17:27:09] <jmer> I like the Expanse for being quite believable in regards to spaceflight and tech

[17:50:04] <interop_madness> I'm generally very unhappy with the way the Star Trek franchise has gone. I would like a new Star Trek series that's heavy on hard sci-fi, diplomacy and philosophical questions (e.g. what constitutes life?), like the best episodes of TNG, just with the whole show focusing on that. Slow-paced, pensieve - in essence, the kind of show that today's kids glued to their phones don't have the attention span for and which will
[17:50:04] <interop_madness> therefore never be greenlit :(
[17:50:59] <interop_madness> And it should advance the timeline!
[17:53:36] <interop_madness> Discovery was basically unwatchable. The only good episode was when Adira Tal was reunited with their Trill symbiont, that was satisfying to watch
[17:53:49] <interop_madness> Star Trek Picard: Yeah. No.
[17:54:01] <jmer> hahaha
[17:54:11] <jmer> I watch Discovery as a sci-fi show
[17:54:15] <jmer> it makes it easier to digest
[17:54:25] <jmer> I don't think about it as Trek
[17:54:45] <jmer> Star Trek Picard could've been good if they didn't portray Picard as a doddering fool for the first many episodes...
[17:54:54] <jmer> I really tried to like Picard but... Yeah I couldn't finish it
[17:55:06] <interop_madness> To be fair, Discovery had some more good moments, the one above is just the one I can still remember
[17:55:17] <jmer> interop_madness: not sure I am entirely up to date on Disco
[17:56:00] <jmer> interop_madness: but yeah I agree the best episodes of trek are the ones that makes you reflect aobut society
[17:56:08] <interop_madness> Picard was infuriating. The whole premise of it. Picard leaving Starfleet? Come THE FUCK on!
[17:56:28] <jmer> interop_madness: yes I don't think PIcard was very Picard compared to how he is in TNG
[17:56:40] <jmer> Too much shouting and drooling
[17:57:15] <interop_madness> Or in Discovery: Starfleet a shadow of its former self. I don't get the urge of screenwriters to sabotage what should be an iron clad constant
[17:57:55] <interop_madness> Expose them to threats and catastrophe sure, but don't throw away the whole game board in an attempt to be "radical"
[17:58:04] <jmer> lol
[17:58:23] <jmer> well... it kinda makes sense that the organization has deteriorated when they can't communicate or reach each other.. But I see your point
[17:58:46] <jmer> I have a bigger gripe with Disco being a prequal
[17:58:48] <interop_madness> "dude what if starfleet is now hitler XDDD" ----> the mirror universe is for these kind of experiments
[17:59:11] <interop_madness> this, too. prequels are always lazy IMHO
[17:59:39] <jmer> It's just jarring.. I mean Kirk's Ship looked like 80s high tech stuff... and Disco has like... holographic 3D screens with touch and gesture based inputs...
[17:59:44] <interop_madness> because it's arguably hard to advance a timeline beyond TNG, considering TNG had some foundation in actual physics, Alcubierre drive and whatnot
[18:00:36] <interop_madness> Advancing the timeline means you have to make up physical and technological foundations that do not yet exist, not even as a theoretical pipe dream of some scientist. Science Fiction.
[18:00:46] <interop_madness> That's fucking hard to do.
[18:00:51] <interop_madness> or rather, to pull of
[18:00:53] <interop_madness> f
[18:01:21] <jmer> I don't know enough about space physics to gauge how real TNG's techonbabble is but to me it just sounds like fancy gibberish :P
[18:01:49] <jmer> So it's not like I have a huge expectation for Star Trek to ground their tech in currently known physics or techs...
[18:02:09] <interop_madness> it is, but in my opinion it's like an educated "dude, what if..." extrapolation from solid science. emphasis on educated
[18:02:09] <jmer> It just has to be a bit more believable than "oh we found this living spaceship that can do magic shit" like Farscape
[18:02:22] <interop_madness> exactly
[18:02:37] <jmer> But I mean.. I think The Expanse does this well.
[18:03:03] <interop_madness> or "there is a hole in the universe where robot gremlins can enter and destroy everything" - "ok, so they can go warp 10+ to do it in time" - "duuuuhhh..."

[19:39:42] <riksteri> "for each violation", would that be per visitor then?
[19:39:50] <Nasp> No idea
[19:39:59] <Nasp> So 6 month x number of violations
[19:40:47] <jmer> isn't the whole point that google sells data and a CDN doesn't? (at least I hope not)
[19:41:07] <jmer> There's no technical reason that google needs your visitor's IP is there?
[19:41:37] <jmer> You could just fork over a bit of money for a CDN and then your user's IP wouldn't end up at google?
[19:41:44] <edcba> indeed
[19:41:56] <irwiss> jmer: fonts is part of google api which they're freely selling data from
[19:42:02] *** Joins: ASUS_ (~ASUS@user/ASUS)
[19:42:19] <jmer> irwiss: But couldn't you just host those fonts on a CDN?
[19:42:36] <Nasp> Yes you could
[19:42:37] <edcba> well not google ones maybe
[19:42:43] <edcba> depending on license
[19:43:16] <irwiss> jmer: you could and probably should self host the fonts, but we're talking front end devs here... who still put <script src=".../jquery"> in the head section ;)
[19:43:32] <riksteri> are we sure using a CDN instead of Google Fonts is an essential difference here? In eyes of that court, for instance?
[19:43:56] <jmer> if they explicitly mention google then I would say so, yes.
[19:44:19] <edcba> "Google, a company that is known to collect data about its users and the individual discomfort felt by the user is so significant that a claim for damages is justified"
[19:44:24] <jmer> afaik GDPR doesn't prevent you from storing/using the user's IP if it's needed to make the site work.
[19:44:38] <riksteri> hmmm, well I guess, if the order is "stop providing IP to google", they can provide them to someone else and not violate the order
[19:44:42] <jmer> I think the problem here, is that the website owner is exchanging it's users privacy for a service from google, instead of forking over some cash for it.
[19:45:09] <jmer> riksteri: as long as it's provided "to make the site work" and the data isn't sold or used in a way the user did not concent to.
[19:45:10] <edcba> yeah would have been another ad supported font provider it may have been ok from the comments i read
[19:45:11] <riksteri> I wouldn't trust CDN companies just throw the data away either
[19:45:33] <jmer> riksteri: you pay for CDN stuff so you can read the contract and make sure they have to
[19:45:36] <irwiss> to be fair i'd rather all font apis removed from the browser... fuckers put a font that differs in a few pixels from system's sans serif font... and put 3mb extra download to read their shitty blogpost with 10 ads and "oh we see you spent 0.000000000001 seconds on our blog, wanna subscribe to our mailing list?"
[19:46:05] <irwiss> and fuck the cretins that subscribe to mailing lists in particular
[19:47:37] <edcba> hmm i realized you can track users with font other than with IP
[19:48:00] <edcba> ie if you are rendering some document with that font to canvas or wherever
[19:48:02] <jmer> you can track users in many ways
[19:48:37] <edcba> but yeah fonts can be used to watermark documents
