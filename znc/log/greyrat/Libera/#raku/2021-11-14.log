[20:30:56] <tbrowder> speaking of macs, i just fired up an old mac mini my son gave me, and it is now a virgin installation ready for a raku install, with git, emacs, etc.
[20:31:42] <tbrowder> can anyone recommend a good book on mac os for linux users?
[20:33:34] <El_Che> I don't think a book is needed
[20:33:59] <El_Che> you'll spend most of the time making the environment tolerable for developing :)
[20:34:35] <El_Che> install homebrew so you can get rakudo and lots of utils
[20:35:06] <El_Che> this may interest you: https://podman.io/blogs/2021/09/06/podman-on-macs.html
[20:35:33] <El_Che> with podman you can run docker containers
[20:36:01] <El_Che> On more complex projects I have a script to launch containers with e.g. mysql and keycloak
[20:36:14] <El_Che> so I can run more complicated tests
[20:36:29] <El_Che> (I hide those with a env AUTHOR_TESTING)
[20:36:57] <El_Che> I develop like that on linux, and this week I was sitting on macos and could not run those extended tests
[20:37:04] <El_Che> so now I have workaround :)

[21:50:39] <perryprog> But besides that the linux-macos transition is usually pretty easy
[21:51:33] <El_Che> tbrowder: I have a common .profile and .bashrc for my linux and mac machines

[22:40:43] <CIAvash> patrickb: I think there may be different ways to tackle it, maybe: `sub f ($resource, *@path) { dd $resource, @path }; my @resources = <css img js>.map: { &f.assuming: $_ }; @resources[0]('a')`
[22:40:45] <El_Che> I also have different users, the mac is managed by it
[22:41:15] <whatnext> hi all :)  today I have a maths question. Probably I am doing sthg goofy, however, I have some code like this: `$m = $a / $b; say "$a $b $m";` with results like `14 16 0.0625`. Obviously `14/16` is not `0.0625` so I wonder what is going on? Something to do with types? dividing with the wrong char? Anyone shed any light? :) 
[22:41:16] <tellable6> 2021-11-11T01:04:03Z #raku <SmokeMachine> whatnext Would you mind to test it? I think it will make your code work (I still have a lot to review and probably fix, but probably that problem Is fixed): https://github.com/FCO/Red/pull/526
[22:46:09] <[Coke]> m: my $a=14; my $b=16; my $m = $a / $b; say "$a $b $m"

[22:46:25] <[Coke]> ^^ Either your golf missed a step or you have a very broken raku
[22:47:24] <whatnext> lol.. it's pretty weird I have to say - certainly wasn't expecting it

[23:00:17] <[Coke]> what do you get if you literally run the code in my example?

[23:14:28] <japhb> .0625 is 1/16 ... so I'm guessing a missing '4' somewhere.
[23:21:45] <CIAvash> patrickb: so if I understood you correctly, the easiest way would be `get -> $resource where <css img js>.any, *@path { resource $resource, @path }`
[23:22:40] <patrickb> CIAvash: Right. I didn't think of that, kinda obvious. Thanks!
