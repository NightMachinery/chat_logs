[07:17:13] *** Parts: pranavats (3fba1d1b34@jabberfr.org) (Error from remote client)
[07:26:27] <qhong> I'm also not quite sure how to make a submodule inside (and override?) an submodule
[07:28:50] <waleee> qhong: re Pierre's comment here? https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/pull/2001#issuecomment-1008698316
[07:32:34] <waleee> I think he suggests creating a new repo on eg. your user and then add it to the .gitmodules file
[07:34:04] <waleee> ah, right, and a directory in _build needs to be initialized correctly
[07:34:20] <waleee> not sure about the correct git incantation for it
[07:36:10] <waleee> (how to not make it be populated etc)

[08:04:48] <jmercouris> qhong: exactly what waleee said
[08:05:13] <jmercouris> and then with regards to your question, I can add the submodule for you
[08:05:20] <jmercouris> if you are using Magit it isn't too hard though
[08:06:14] <jmercouris> qhong: ultimately it is just adding an entry to this file: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/.gitmodules
[08:07:07] <jmercouris> so actually your hooks repository should be a sort of standalone system
[08:07:21] <jmercouris> qhong: would you like me to provide an example of how to do it?
[08:07:34] <jmercouris> I could even host it on atlas-engineer GitHub if you want
[08:08:08] <jmercouris> so once again if I am not being clear:
[08:08:29] <jmercouris> The hooks work you've done should NOT be an override to Serapeum, it should be just your own hooks library with its own ASD file, etc

[17:59:28] <nij-> Hi :) Is it currently possible to have a page of graphs (DAGS) that show the history of pages - a node is a page, and an arrow (a->b) means b is a page opened from a link in a?
[17:59:59] <nij-> If not, could you hint how it can be implemented?
[18:00:44] <Jing> I believe we have history tree, which may be relevant to this?
[18:01:48] <nij-> Oooh hoooo this is great.
[18:05:04] <aartaka> nij-: you can see `describe-command buffer-history-tree` for the source code of how we display our history tree. From this, it should be pretty straightforward to move to the presentation you described :)

[18:10:45] <nij-> aartaka: Thanks :) I think the current presentation is nice. I wish for each node a timestamp (indicating when it's first opened) can be attached. Do I need to hack a lot for that?

[18:13:27] <aartaka> nij-: Hmmmm, that we don't yet store. We store the last-access, though. See https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1848 for the discussion on storing more things to history.

[18:14:06] <aartaka> *something.
[18:17:17] <nij-> Hmm.. while I do speak a bit CL, I don't speak mozilla API. Any good way for me to get started?
[18:19:42] <nij-> Btw.. sorry if this is too noobie, but I'm overwhelmed by css-related configs in nyxt. Currently, in history tree, both the background and the texts are black, so I cannot see the links unless I select the texts. What did I do wrong in the config? - https://bpa.st/DXXQ
[18:24:41] <nij-> Hmm.. another thing: from what I see, `history-tree` is restricted to the current buffer, unlike it's described here https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/global-history-tree.org . Is this a bug? I'm on nyxt 2.2.3.

[18:39:15] <aartaka> nij-: Do you use it in a nosave-buffer? If so, that's an intended behavior, as nosave-buffer history is isolated.
[18:40:53] <aartaka> nlj-: You need to change styling in `nyxt/history-mode:history-mode` to change text color.
[18:42:18] <aartaka> nlj-: to tease you, latest master has theming support allowing you to set up the appearance of Nyxt in less than ten lines :)
[18:44:03] <nij-> How do I know if I'm in a nosave-buffer?

[18:52:05] <aartaka> nij-: nosave buffers have "nosave" in their mode line (that, as I see, you disabled :)
[18:53:19] <aartaka> nij-: Do you maybe use nosave-data-profile?
[18:53:45] <aartaka> nij-: How much buffers do you have open when you try history-tree?
[18:55:02] <nij-> Ah.. nyxt crashes and the history tree is gone, it seems. Lemme try again.
[18:56:50] <nij-> Nope I don't think nosave is on by default. Lemme try again.
[19:00:56] <nij-> I enabled the mode line again, but see no nosave-mode.
[19:01:12] <nij-> Yet, calling history-tree only shows the tree of the buffer.
