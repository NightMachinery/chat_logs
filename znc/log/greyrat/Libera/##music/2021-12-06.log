[03:26:07] <sublim20> uh huh
[03:26:14] <louipc> is there a lot of music there
[03:26:18] <redempt1on> My music is gangster even when it's the smooth shit
[03:26:26] <redempt1on> there was till the removed embedded youtube
[03:26:31] <louipc> also is tiktok good for music or bad
[03:26:35] <redempt1on> then it mainly became people playing tunes through their own speakers
[03:26:38] <redempt1on> which is usually shit
[03:26:47] <redempt1on> tiktok is for teenage girls I think
[03:26:50] <redempt1on> I just use spotify
[03:27:05] <redempt1on> wireless headphones are good.
[03:27:12] <redempt1on> speakers at home. crank it up in the car
[03:27:21] <louipc> yea bad quality resampled shit
[03:27:24] <redempt1on> I will never ever buy a wired headset or headphones again
[03:27:31] <redempt1on> I like spotify
[03:27:37] <louipc> what about inear monitors
[03:27:41] <redempt1on> Bluetooth headphones sucked not cause of the bluetooth
[03:27:47] <redempt1on> because of the headphones 
[03:27:56] <louipc> how often u charge em
[03:27:58] <redempt1on> not they are awesome, crisp, clear, hard itting
[03:28:09] <louipc> not so much pro gear is bluetooth
[03:28:12] <redempt1on> whenever. I have a pair of on ear, two pair of earbuds and overear coming in the mail
[03:28:18] <redempt1on> and I have wired beats 
[03:28:22] <redempt1on> but wired sucks
[03:28:31] <louipc> and if its wireless they have their own wireless protocol
[03:28:35] <redempt1on> bluetooth
[03:28:39] <redempt1on> oh
[03:28:43] <louipc> i mean pro gear
[03:28:47] <redempt1on> cant wait for my skullcandy crushers
[03:29:01] <redempt1on> Get high sit back and listen to music on the couch
[03:29:07] <redempt1on> lay back*
[03:29:12] <Bakunin> i thought regular bluetooth wasn't full CD quality audio in stereo
[03:29:23] <redempt1on> Bluetooth is good. companies sitll m ake shitty headphones
[03:29:25] <Bakunin> so it had to encode, send, decode
[03:29:29] <redempt1on> SPotify is good
[03:29:30] <louipc> think of those lav mic hookups they use on tv shows and stuff
[03:29:33] <redempt1on> can use it on anything
[03:29:42] <redempt1on> you have millions of songs at your fingers without ads 
[03:29:52] <Bakunin> thats all bluetooth now?  wild
[03:29:52] <redempt1on> make your own playlists, sub to others, use radio mode
[03:29:53] <louipc> ppl walking around with the little transmitter box under their shirt
[03:30:20] <louipc> u pay for spotify?
[03:30:20] <redempt1on> Spotify rejuvenated we consume music
[03:30:26] <redempt1on> i have a bluetooth mp3 player for the gym
[03:30:27] <redempt1on> it's nice
[03:30:37] <redempt1on> AGPTEK
[03:30:38] <louipc> kool
[03:30:52] <redempt1on> I pay for spotify yes
[03:31:00] <redempt1on> i had it free for a few years on a friends acct but he removed me at some point
[03:31:03] <redempt1on> been paying for 3-4 years now
[03:31:21] <redempt1on> and if your own mp3s are too cool cause theyre so obscure, underground, you can just put them on spotify anyway
[03:31:25] <redempt1on> upload them to your profile
[03:32:11] <louipc> do u get paid if they stream it
[03:32:16] <redempt1on> yeap
[03:32:21] <redempt1on> they get their cut
[03:32:21] <louipc> sweet
[03:32:29] <redempt1on> oh, your own mp3s? probably not
[03:32:34] <redempt1on> only registered artists get paid
[03:32:41] <louipc> dang
[03:32:53] <louipc> better register as independent label
[03:32:53] <sublim20> alright, someone run the calcs and see if streaming your own songs from multiple cheap SBC's is a worthwhile endeavor
[03:32:57] <redempt1on> My friend still collects music cds from thrift stores, record shops. such a waste of time and money
[03:32:58] <redempt1on> and space
[03:33:02] <louipc> then upload all ur obscure stuff
[03:33:31] <louipc> sublim20: spotify has the infrastructure
[03:33:41] <sublim20> i dont use that
[03:33:47] <louipc> how u gonna get paid then
[03:33:54] <sublim20> threats of violence
[03:34:04] <louipc> u still need a payment system
[03:34:11] <sublim20> thats called blood
[03:34:15] <sublim20> i get paid in blood
[03:34:43] <louipc> blood is only marginally transmissible over internet
[03:34:57] <sublim20> i dont need to collect the blood
[03:34:58] <sublim20> just cause it
[03:35:07] <sublim20> for example, stick your face in front of your cd rom and open it
[03:35:13] <sublim20> punch yourself in the face with your cdrom
[03:37:42] <louipc> it just touched my face then went into hiding again
[03:38:11] <sublim20> that means 6 more weeks of winter
[03:38:25] <redempt1on> the compact disc will have no collectible value in the future
[03:38:30] <redempt1on> it was a failed medium
[03:38:52] <sublim20> uh huh
[03:38:59] <louipc> why not
[03:39:10] <sublim20> oh god, dont encourage him
[03:39:35] <louipc> i think CD will be just fine for nostalgia ppl
[03:40:16] <louipc> i havent been out to any show for a long time. how are ppl selling music there now?
[03:40:26] <louipc> download codes?
[03:40:48] <louipc> would be nice to have physical digital copy with lyric book/notes
[03:48:41] <sublim20> physical copies work, and cds still matter
[03:48:45] <sublim20> people have cars
[03:48:49] <sublim20> cars have cd players.
[03:49:05] <louipc> it should be wireless physical copy tho
[03:49:16] <sublim20> it should be on shady as fuck usb thumb drives
[03:49:24] <louipc> like nfc. touch your phone against the booklet and the music appears in the phne
[03:49:54] <louipc> nah sdcard at worst
[03:50:01] <sublim20> phonograph
[03:50:05] <sublim20> for hipsters.
[03:50:21] <louipc> old cars have cd players
[03:50:43] <louipc> new ones dont. they do have usb, not sure about card readers

[04:12:54] <redempt1on> walkmen, discmen then mp3 player
[04:12:59] <redempt1on> first Rios held 4 songs

[04:13:18] <redempt1on> so stupid
[04:13:36] <redempt1on> this was about 2001 or 2002
[04:14:59] <louipc> lol 4song
[04:15:20] <redempt1on> Yeah
[04:15:28] <redempt1on> what's the  point of making them.
[04:15:33] <redempt1on> except the fact they dont' skip like CDs.
[04:15:38] <redempt1on> and were much smaller
[04:15:57] <louipc> i just played the music in my head by myself for so long
[04:16:10] <redempt1on> He didnt even own a PC at the time. he wanted the mp3 player for the gym. his plan was just to change songs around at friends' homes
[04:16:12] <redempt1on> 8 songs though...

[04:20:42] <redempt1on> and I'd much rather listen to the real rapper Snow perform "informer" than this.
[04:20:56] <redempt1on> that guy's beat is shit. his autotune signging is shit.
[04:21:03] <redempt1on> this why music is left up to the professionals.
[04:22:00] <Bakunin> I believe the humor is lost on you :)
[04:22:28] <redempt1on> Snow was actually gansgter tho
[04:22:36] <redempt1on> thats why his career went nowhere
[04:22:45] <redempt1on> kept going to jail they got fed up with him and let him go off the label

[06:01:11] <louipc> good idea
[06:01:14] <Panther> Just screw the stem of the bong onto one of the hoses.

[19:39:51] <artao> varies a bit, but i guess i tend towards purples, on the bluer side than red side
[19:40:25] <murthy> lite violet?
[19:40:36] <murthy> like
[19:40:46] <artao> but i also very much like red and electric blue and this yellow orange that is STRONG. goes great with purples

[19:41:53] <artao> sure

[19:41:57] <murthy> ok
[19:41:59] <murthy> ya
[19:42:16] <artao> can't really REALLY get it with pigments or ink. only with light

[19:42:58] <murthy> indeed
[19:43:06] <artao> alizarin crimson is the only RED red i use for painting
[19:43:14] <murthy> nothing like the colors that nature shows us
[19:43:21] <artao> well ... rose madder, for watercolours. specifically for certain sunset/sunrise hues
[19:43:39] <artao> cadmium red, but that's really more orange
[19:43:40] <murthy> oh ok
[19:43:41] <murthy> call
[19:43:54] <artao> and REAL cadmium. not that substitute shit. give me the toxic stuff
[19:44:30] <artao> i also use actual lead white. the lead actually interacts chemically with the oil paint to beneficially change the final paint film
[19:44:34] <artao> tho it can also cause yellowing
[19:44:42] <artao> BUT, a painter can account for that
[19:44:59] <artao> actual cobalt ... which is pretty pricey
[19:46:50] <artao> pricey, but good paints are STRONGLY pigmented, so you end up using far less
[19:47:07] <artao> tho still more titanium white or zinc white or lead white or bone white
[19:47:13] <artao> well .. ivory white
[19:47:23] <artao> bone black ... cuz it's charred bone
[19:47:39] <artao> literally. yes. oil paint made from charred bone
[19:48:37] <artao> it's warmer than other blacks
[19:49:16] <artao> regardless, mixing blacks is better than tube black, usually
