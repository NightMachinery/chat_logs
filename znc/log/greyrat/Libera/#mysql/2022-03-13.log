[15:24:55] <kiras> hello, I have the same problem as posted here ; https://askubuntu.com/questions/964417/is-it-possible-to-restore-a-mysql-database-from-the-var-lib-mysql-database-fold
[15:25:02] <kiras> I followed the steps in the offered solution, but at the step ' systemctl start mariadb'   mariadb doesnt start
[15:25:12] <kiras> this is the error; https://paste.debian.net/hidden/9f22405f/
[15:25:25] <kiras> as proposed in the above solution, I purged mariadb-server, and the mentioned mysql folders, too. then I reinstalled mariadb (and all the other packages that were removed previously), stopped mysql and moved 'only' my db folders from the backed-up 'var/lib'mysql'.
[15:25:32] <kiras> then changed their perms.
[15:25:41] <kiras> '#chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql '
[15:25:49] <kiras> then I edited /etc/mysql/my.cnf and added 'innodb_force_recovery=6' to the [mysqld] section
[15:25:55] <kiras> at that point mysqld cannot be started
[15:26:02] <kiras> also this is the 'journalctl -xe' output; https://paste.debian.net/hidden/5290e101/
[15:26:41] <kiras> I can't initiate mysql, since  'sudo mysql –u root –p' gives this error whether password is entered or not;
[15:26:49] <kiras> ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)'

[16:19:06] <Xgc> kiras: mysql (the client) can't connect if the server isn't started.  Don't worry about that step until you have the server started AND the socket file is created.
[16:29:27] <Xgc> kiras: It's tough to tell if you have a good backup and are restoring files correctly.  That all needs to be done correctly.
[16:33:01] <kiras> i am following the above link and as I described
[16:34:01] <kiras> that is precisely what I am asking. is this correct?
[16:35:24] <kiras> same process is repeatedly posted for different questions. I am trying to find out what fails in my case
[16:38:06] <kiras> sure there are a lot of people here who know why this error line occurs; '    Process: 41512 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/mariadbd $MYSQLD_OPTS $_WSREP_NEW_CLUSTER $_WSREP_START_POSITION (code=exited, status=203/EXEC)'
[16:40:25] <Xgc> kiras: The link is not entirely clear in some of the areas that are most important.

[16:42:52] <Xgc> kiras: The important part is about what files you have in your backup and in what state they were in when mysqld was last cleanly stopped.  If not cleanly stopped, what was the state?
[16:44:59] <Xgc> kiras: Lots of detail unstated.  "I did the same thing as described ..."  is not true.  It can't be true.
[16:45:51] <Xgc> Unless you write the article and were eventually successful.
[16:45:55] <Xgc> wrote
[16:47:00] <kiras> Xgc, this is how the backup '/var/lib/mysql' looks ; https://paste.debian.net/plainh/386810eb
[16:48:30] <Xgc> Can you explain the state of the files?
[16:48:47] <kiras> I dont know. I dont even understand what you mean.
[16:49:22] <Xgc> kiras: mysqld reads and writes to those files, and closes them at some point when shutting down.
[16:50:03] <kiras> these are the backups from a clean state.
[16:51:29] <Xgc> Perfect.  That wasn't clear.  You started with: "I have the same problem as posted here"  The poster did not clearly have a clean backup.  "Due to a nightmare"
[16:53:41] <Xgc> What drove you to that article instead of a normal backup/restore or upgrade document in the MySQL docs.
[16:54:15] <kiras> I have no backup of the db itself. I have only this folder. I needed to restore dbs from there
[16:54:15] *** Joins: lucerne (~lucerne@ip202.ip-51-178-215.eu)
[16:55:46] <Xgc> That's odd.  Why not just restart / backup before all this?
[16:56:49] <Xgc> In any case, you can skip all that important detail, if you wish.  Step back to the first part of the restore that failed.  Look at the errors.
[16:57:08] <kiras> I already did. they are posted above
[16:57:33] <Xgc> Not much detail there.
[16:57:43] <kiras> do you want to help me?
[16:58:03] <kiras> this is all the error I have
[16:58:15] <Xgc> I was trying to find out what steps led to the error.  It's usually something in the lead up.
[16:58:43] <Xgc> But everything is perfect, according to the story.
[16:58:56] <Xgc> What versions were involved?
[16:59:01] <kiras> I first copied the backup folder straight to the current one. then my sites showed different errors. so I found this post and started all over
[16:59:58] <kiras> both old and new mariadbs are 10.5., yet the old one is 10.5.11. and the current install is 10.5.12, I just figured that and was thinking perhaps it helps if I install the old version
[17:00:12] <Xgc> That should have 0 impact.
[17:01:16] <Xgc> I'm still missing something.  Is this a new system / hardware?

[17:02:41] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[17:02:49] <Xgc> This is the perfect case to copy files, if they are cleanly closed in a normal shutdown.
[17:03:44] <kiras> listen. if you will help, please do. I am not here to entertain you
[17:04:14] <kiras> I have enough issues and dont have time to answer same questions again and again
[17:06:29] <Xgc> kiras: It's ok.  Next time provide the real detail and we won't need to play 20 questions.  What you typed at the beginning was not correct.  So I then question everything else you typed. That's just the way it is when detail is not correct.
[17:06:50] <Xgc> We're done.
[17:07:11] <kiras> more than fine. someone else can perhaps help and I hope you witness how it is done.
[17:07:25] <Xgc> With the above, maybe there's a chance.
[17:07:42] <Xgc> The hard part is getting the story, usually.
[17:08:21] <kiras> I posted tons of pastes. anyone with the basic 'willingness to help' would be more than satisfied on any channel
[17:08:35] <Xgc> kiras: You can stop.  Just wait.
