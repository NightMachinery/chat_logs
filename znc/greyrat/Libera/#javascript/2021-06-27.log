[00:33:32] <Slade> i really like he concept of styles written in javascript

[00:36:29] <onosendi> emotion... interesting.
[00:37:17] <onosendi> Hmm, what's PropType for DOM element?
[00:37:18] <Slade> current project just tried tailwind for the first time
[00:37:26] <onosendi> Slade: what'd you think?
[00:37:38] <GreenJello> const DividerY = styled.button`
[00:37:38] <GreenJello>   top: calc(${(props) => props.percent * 100}% - var(--quad-split-divider) / 2);
[00:37:44] <GreenJello> this is a fun snippet

[00:46:10] <Slade> GreenJello, did you try styled components by any chance? before settling on emotion
[00:46:41] <Slade> wroathe, if you dont care a great deal about the components, tailwind might be ok for you
[00:46:53] <GreenJello> I didn't, but I don't actually know what the difference is between them
[00:47:03] <GreenJello> they seem extremely similar
[00:47:04] <Slade> they're both "css in js"
[00:47:29] <GreenJello> like I think my code works exactly the same in both, just swapping out the import
[00:47:48] <wroathe> It doesn't matter which language owns it. The syntax isn't the problem, it's the act of writing out the styles themselves
[00:47:56] <onosendi> wroathe: I used to feel the same way. scss fixed that for me, though.
[00:48:55] <wroathe> onosendi: Haha. Most everyone seems to be moving away from the preprocessors. I was a CSS shark back around like 2013, and we made heavy use of sass and less.
[00:49:19] <wroathe> onosendi: Now the core language (CSS) supports variables, arithmetic, and there's a proposal for nested selectors
[00:49:37] <Slade> GreenJello, https://blog.logrocket.com/styled-components-vs-emotion-for-handling-css/   the two examples look like style-components is a little js heavier, and emotion is more.. css
[00:49:39] <onosendi> wroathe: indeed, but it's still missing mixins/functions/imports.
[00:49:44] <GreenJello> there are still things where preprocessors are super nice
[00:49:59] <wroathe> GreenJello: Indeed. It's just getting harder to sell the idea of using one, is all.

[05:14:52] <GreenJello> nedbat, your mac is plugged into a touchscreen monitor?
[05:15:12] <nedbat> GreenJello: i'm using the trackpad.
[05:15:55] <GreenJello> that would be the wheel event
[05:16:05] <GreenJello> pointer events are for absolute pointing devices, like touch screens
[05:16:23] <nedbat> GreenJello: in google maps, i can do a two-finger pinch on the trackpad.  how can i do that in my own site?
[05:17:30] <GreenJello> you implement the pointer event thing for touch screen devices, and also the wheel event for mice/trackpads, and you might also handle +/- key presses for keyboards
[05:18:37] <nedbat> GreenJello: i'm trying to do the same thing google maps does.
[05:20:32] <entuland> sorry to be nitpicky, but no, the gesture you do and the events that get fired may match but they're not the same thing
[05:21:08] <nedbat> entuland: maybe i'm just exploring the wrong path.  How can i find out how firefox is implementing a two-finger pinch on my trackpad?

[05:29:44] <entuland> were you able to use two finger rotation on any web page with your mac?
[05:29:51] <nedbat> entuland: now that i think about it, no :(
[05:31:11] <entuland> it kinda makes sense cause true touch events have a 1-to-1 mapping from the touch surface to the display, the touchpad is kinda of a relative thing where you can't tell "this finger is on this point of the page, this other finger is on that other point"
[05:32:17] *** Joins: silly_ (~silly@user/silly)
[05:32:50] <entuland> as much as I find multi touch events useful, I think that systems should be designed not to _require_ them and give alternative means to do something

[05:33:17] <entuland> I mean, sometimes you're holding your phone with a single hand and you only have a free thumb to control the page
[05:33:44] <GreenJello> it could be exposed through a gesture API, it just doesn't fit into the progressive approach since any pinch gesture is partially also a rotation (fingers don't really move perfectly apart on a line)

[09:25:17] <ashnur> that's not ts, that's string and is a datetime format. you need something to parse it with, i suggest date-fns
[09:25:46] <ljharb> i suggest moment.js
[09:25:55] <ljharb> but either way you need a library
[09:26:50] <onosendi> Given these 3 functions, is it necessary to use `useCallback` on `entryFunc`, or just on the two expensive ones?
[09:26:52] <onosendi> https://dpaste.org/Xe6u
[09:27:06] <theskillwithin> ljharb hows that temporal polyfill doing?
[09:27:47] <GreenJello> onosendi, useCallback is about preserving the identity of the function between renders, not anything to do with the contents of the function
[09:27:51] <onosendi> If I use `useCallback` on only `entryFunc`, is `funcOne` and `funcTwo` memoized?
[09:27:58] <ashnur> ljharb, why do you like moment over date-fns?
[09:28:15] <GreenJello> useCallback doesn't memoize
[09:28:30] <onosendi> GreenJello: blah, everywhere I read it says referential equality and expensiveness.
[09:28:55] <ljharb> ashnur: it's the defacto standard. mostly everyone uses it. and date-fns is instantly obsolete once there's a viable temporal polyfill
[09:28:59] <ljharb> theskillwithin: lol still haven't built it
[09:29:00] <onosendi> So, don't use `useCallback` unless I need to maintain referential equality?
[09:29:32] <theskillwithin> ljharb gotta find the time to do it 😀
[09:29:34] <GreenJello> yeah, so if you use a function in the dependency array of another hook, you might want it to be stable between renders to avoid the dependency array "changing" on every render
[09:29:53] <GreenJello> or for props of a component that does shallow equality checks to skip renders

[09:30:21] <ashnur> ljharb, everyone is counted when and by whom? because i question that 100%. and wouldn't by the same logic moment.js also be obsolete at the same time? Not saying you should use date-fns or anything, I was just curious and it still doesn't make sense, but let's not argue :D
[09:30:53] <ljharb> ashnur: moment.js will be obsolete at that time also. but there's more material and support out there for moment, so you'll be in a better place to migrate to temporal from there.

[09:31:32] <ljharb> ashnur: certainly my argument is much stronger to not migrate from moment to something else that's not temporal - than an argument to start fresh with moment
[09:31:38] <ashnur> that's only true if i am already at a better place with moment.js than with date-fns, but that's not true, i migrated from moment because it sucked
[09:31:52] <theskillwithin> i find every time I use moment, I take out the locals to make it a smaller package
[09:31:55] <ashnur> but that's just my subjective assessment, not expecting to be shared by anyone
[09:32:25] <ashnur> and i migrated years ago, before date-fnsv2 was released, now the v2 is way better, so no reason to leave

[13:49:35] <silly_> at work i'm just the silly helper, the "know it all" kind of
[13:50:29] <theskillwithin> be careful, theres a reason why u need license to do that sorta stuff

[20:03:33] <onizu> Hi. Any idea why $.each(obj, function() {}); is sorting the values based on their keys? I don't want it to sort.

[20:12:08] <onizu> ThePendulum: see this: https://jsfiddle.net/b0cky15a/
[20:12:08] <farn> onizu: Do you get a different order with Object.keys(obj)?

[20:12:46] <onizu> ThePendulum: farn :   ..see in the fiddle, it's sorting
[20:12:51] <farn> Yeah, numerical keys are sorted automatically by the language.
[20:12:57] <onizu> damn
[20:13:00] <farn> If the order matters, I'd use an array if possible.
[20:13:10] <onizu> any way to preserve the original sort order?
[20:13:18] <ThePendulum> with an array
[20:13:23] <onizu> I'm getting JSON response
[20:13:31] <onizu> (an object)
[20:13:58] <ThePendulum> what do the numbers represent if not the intended order?
[20:14:15] <onizu> they are some IDs
[20:14:36] <onizu> and the actual order is by the value
[20:14:43] <ThePendulum> I would turn it into an array and then just re-sort it by value if that's what you need
[20:14:55] <onizu> is there a way to loop through an object preserving the original order?
[20:15:17] <onizu> hmm
