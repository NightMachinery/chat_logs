[15:34:20] <enthus1ast[m]> ah and also this only works one time ...
[15:37:11] <enthus1ast[m]> all the plugins i find does some kind of polling :/ 
[15:37:38] <ii14[m]> I mean, you have to do polling
[15:37:41] <enthus1ast[m]> no 
[15:37:51] <ii14[m]> you need to receive an event from the kernel that the file changed
[15:38:08] <enthus1ast[m]> you can get informed by the different os'es if a file has changed
[15:38:22] <ii14[m]> yes, and you need to poll for events
[15:39:51] <ii14[m]> how do you think that works? you just wait and listen until kernel notifies you on some file descriptor, also known as polling
[15:40:31] <ii14[m]> that's how it works on the lower level at least
[15:41:14] <ii14[m]> you could use libuv for that, uv_fs_event_t
[15:41:43] <ii14[m]> I don't know how nvim does the autoread thing, but I suspect it probably does just that
[15:42:35] <enthus1ast[m]> you must call `checktime` to actually get the desired effect
[15:42:56] <ii14[m]> I don't call checktime and it works for me
[15:43:05] <ii14[m]> when I focus the buffer
[15:43:45] <ii14[m]> https://github.com/luvit/luv/blob/master/docs.md#uv_fs_event_t--fs-event-handle
[15:43:59] <ii14[m]> luv is under `vim.loop`
[15:47:56] <ii14[m]> you just set it up for a file and it will call callbacks for you whenever something happens
[15:49:56] <ii14[m]> the way I'd do it is to only listen for changes on the currently focused buffer, and clean it up when it loses focus so you don't have any leaks
[16:05:37] <enthus1ast[m]> i've done it like this now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/18ab4675f6b5bc5c0376e8f0776f6be1417c0c44)

[19:35:38] <nmattia[m]> hi folks! with some help from mjlbach and clason I managed to install some plugins (without a plugin manager) by adding them as `$NEOVIM_DIR/pack/foo/start/<plugin checkout>` and then adding `$NEOVIM_DIR` to my package path with `set packpath+=$NEOVIM_DIR`. That worked nicely, however I can't use `:help` on any of those plugins (for instance https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua). Any idea what I might be doing wrong? Do I need to do
[19:35:38] <nmattia[m]> something for the `doc/` directories to be picked up by neovim?

[19:39:05] <mjlbach[m]> Hmm I thought that would do it
[19:39:06] <mjlbach[m]> https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/blob/e5c8c01374350b4fcfd56da2afc87434c51b3972/lua/packer/plugin_utils.lua#L75-L83
[19:39:17] <mjlbach[m]> packer I think provides the path to each plugin and calls helptags on it
[19:39:39] <gpanders> helptags ALL should work, I’ve used it many times
[19:39:43] <mjlbach[m]> try
[19:39:46] <gpanders> It might only search runtimepath though
[19:39:53] <mjlbach[m]> cd <plugindir>
[19:39:54] <mjlbach[m]> nvim -c "helptags doc/"
[19:40:01] <mjlbach[m]> Just do that manually, that should work
[19:40:13] <mjlbach[m]> however, it should work
[19:41:36] <nmattia[m]> ok, unfortunately my plugins are on a RO directory and it looks like helptags wants to modify it:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/5043ab9ff0c90d555e5456a9a9cd2c9f4343814c)

[19:41:51] <mjlbach[m]> yes
[19:41:57] <mjlbach[m]> it will generate helptags in the plugin directory
[19:42:15] <mjlbach[m]> You will need to look into the nix expressions and generate helptags during the build phase
[19:42:32] <nmattia[m]> yep will probably do that, and see how helptags is implemented. Thanks a bunch!

[23:20:08] <Alyxia[m]> how do I exclude items from `vim.lsp.buf.formatting_sync()`?
[23:20:20] <Alyxia[m]> sumneko added formatting to their language server and it is horrible
[23:21:14] <Alyxia[m]> I am being presented with the choice of using null-ls or sumneko as the formatter each damn time I save and I would prefer to exclude sumneko from this list so null-ls is used by default
[23:25:53] <mjlbach[m]> There are many solutions to this
[23:25:59] <mjlbach[m]> 1 is hacky and present in the null-ls wiki
[23:26:28] <mjlbach[m]> 2 is to not use null-ls for formatting, and just use a standard formatting plugin or formatexpr

[23:27:55] <mjlbach[m]> that's the one

[23:35:32] <mizlan[m]> mjlbach: why is that hacky?
[23:36:35] <mjlbach[m]> mizlan[m]: null-ls is introducing a problem (needing to disable other servers) when it would be entirely possible to expose a function to directly format with *only* null-ls instead of injecting itself as a "language server", and the having users disable all other language servers formatting capabilities
[23:36:55] <mjlbach[m]> > <@mizlan:matrix.org> mjlbach: why is that hacky?
[23:36:55] <mjlbach[m]>  * null-ls is introducing a problem (needing to disable other servers) when it would be entirely possible to expose a function to directly format with _only_ null-ls instead of injecting itself as a "language server", and the having users disable all other language servers formatting capabilities so that buf_request will only trigger null-ls
[23:37:49] <mjlbach[m]> there's absolutely no advantage to passing formatting through the intermediate of the language server protocol
[23:38:13] <mizlan[m]> I see. So more generally, null-ls itself is a hack
[23:38:40] <mizlan[m]> oh nevermind i qualify my statement
[23:38:44] <mjlbach[m]> sure, formatting is particularly egregious though because 9/10 times people want to disable the language server's built-in formatting in favor of null-ls
[23:39:29] <dundargoc> Ooh, nice reminder, I still haven't contributed to null-ls

[23:41:52] <mattf> Doom emacs has this cool M-x git-gutter:next-git-hunk, which is bound to [d and ]d. Is there something similar i could do for neovim
[23:42:14] <mjlbach[m]> mattf: Have you tried gitsigns?
[23:42:15] <mattf> this allows me to walk through the different hunks
[23:42:19] <mattf> let me see
[23:42:39] <mjlbach[m]> There's a utiltiy function you can bind that provides exactly that functionality
[23:42:47] <mattf> ok thanks
