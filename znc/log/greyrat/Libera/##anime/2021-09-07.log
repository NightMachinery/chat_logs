[01:04:21] <Nanobot> HoloCouncil isn't allowed to collab with Hololive members outside their group yet, but Gura keeps trying to collab with them anyway. Today, Gura is planning to do a Minecraft stream on the HoloEN server at the exact same time that Mumei is planning her first Minecraft stream on the HoloEN server. Gura's stream is called "smells like MISCHIEF".
[01:04:22] <mixfix41> i own a fleshlight 
[01:04:32] <mixfix41> i got one already i know the feelz dood
[01:04:40] <dfch> Nanobot, am waiting for the day korone goes independent

[01:05:59] <Nanobot> Bco1981: In her previous Minecraft stream, she said this one would be on the HoloEN server.
[01:06:15] <dfch> mixfix41 i use water base with 3d humans, works for me
[01:06:21] <Nanobot> She wants to build something for Shion, but knowing Gura, those plans are probably already out the window.
[01:06:40] <Bco1981> or, not gonna finish
[01:06:44] <mixfix41> dfch lemme show you something one min..
[01:06:57] <dfch> mixfix41, please show me something 2d
[01:07:07] <mixfix41> yes its a drawing
[01:07:40] <Nanobot> Bco1981: The original plan was to recreate Shion's first ever Minecraft build, as a surprise for when she gives Shion a tour of the server. I don't know what Shion's first build was, but I give Gura a 0% chance of accurately recreating it. Gura isn't exactly known for perfectionism.
[01:07:47] <dfch> Bco1981, still want something 3d from you though

[01:09:35] <Nanobot> Bco1981: More likely, Gura is planning to come up with pranks. She talked about wanting to prank Pekora at some point (with a trap that's so simple, Pekora won't see it coming). She might also try some test runs on Mumei.
[01:09:48] <Bco1981> i just have to cut them out and make them shiny black.

[08:17:43] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: let us know what you think
[08:18:34] <Emmanuel_Chanel> Well, it would be nice to try Manjaro or Arch Linux. But they would lack proprietary packages.

[09:51:20] <ButterNoodle> it does either... or both
[09:51:48] <amigojapan> I think senti is beyond help
[09:52:01] <ButterNoodle> no one is beyond help

[09:53:28] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:54:48] <amigojapan> That is far beyond what I have ever heard of before
[09:55:24] <ButterNoodle> if you've ever worked around mental health.. you will see many things
[09:55:45] <amigojapan> Ok
[09:55:46] <ButterNoodle> addiction is terrible, but can be fixed
[09:55:55] <ButterNoodle> most cases never cured, but fixed
[09:55:55] <amigojapan> Alright
[09:56:28] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I quit smoking, so I was cured
[09:57:06] <ButterNoodle> I guess... depends on ur definition of these things
[09:57:19] <amigojapan> Ok
[09:57:57] <ButterNoodle> if u understand that having an addiction is a personality disorder
[09:58:05] <amigojapan> It's been like 20 years since I quit
[09:58:17] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[09:58:30] <ButterNoodle> I quit jan 10 2001
[09:59:04] <amigojapan> I don't remember the exact date. But it was around the same time
[09:59:05] <ButterNoodle> I smoked from 13-23
[09:59:56] <amigojapan> I think the first time I tried cigarettes I was like 9. Just said I was buying them for my parents
[09:59:56] <ButterNoodle> I drank heavy for 7 years too..
[10:00:09] <ButterNoodle> yea I probably tried them earlier..
[10:00:15] <ButterNoodle> my dad was a smoker
[10:00:17] <amigojapan> I never had a drinking problem
[10:00:28] <ButterNoodle> me either
[10:00:36] <amigojapan> Nobody in my family smoked
[10:00:44] <ButterNoodle> its a problem when it affects productivity
[10:01:08] <ButterNoodle> alcoholism is pretty much that..
[10:01:19] <amigojapan> I have never drank very continuously
[10:01:28] <ButterNoodle> theres probably a long list of qualifiers
[10:01:57] <ButterNoodle> but I dont think I could be considered an alcoholic if I can just up and quit..
[10:02:02] <amigojapan> Once I drink one day, I am sick of it for a while
[10:02:09] <ButterNoodle> yea
[10:02:17] <ButterNoodle> I feel that way now
[10:02:26] <amigojapan> Good good
[10:02:40] <ButterNoodle> I have had a few drinks here and there since I quit, but not drinking every day
[10:02:55] <ButterNoodle> I think probably 4-5 drinks since I quit in march
[10:02:56] <amigojapan> That's good
[10:03:47] <amigojapan> I am more addicted to coffee. But that is not very harmful
[10:03:48] <ButterNoodle> I realize I do have an obsessive personality.. not so much an addict personality
[10:03:54] <ButterNoodle> yea I love coffee
[10:04:00] <ButterNoodle> I guess I am addicted to that
[10:04:20] <amigojapan> Good thing coffee is ok
[10:04:27] <ButterNoodle> I drink a pound a week
[10:04:51] <amigojapan> I drink one or two large cups every day
[10:05:25] <ButterNoodle> I think I drink 3 a no most days
[10:05:57] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: tomako and I were about to become addicted to caffeine pills when she said we should flush them down the toilet
[10:06:21] <ButterNoodle> yea caffeine pills defeat the enjoyment of drinking
[10:06:45] <amigojapan> They are like cocaine
[10:07:24] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: we were talking more and more every day
[10:07:27] <ButterNoodle> I remember eating 1/2 a bottle of those on a dare...

[12:58:01] <death916> a musician is an artist
[12:58:12] <Matt|home> "The biggest difference between illustrator and artist is the purpose of the work. Illustrators create images to help promote a function or a product. Artists create art to express emotions. In other words, an illustration is a visual explanation of the text, almost always comes with context"
[12:58:24] <Matt|home> right so no difference.
[12:58:28] <waldo> so artist
[12:58:28] <waldo> ok
[12:58:30] <death916> illustrators can conbey emotion as well

[13:01:18] <waldo> slo
[13:01:26] <waldo> ur a plastic memory
[13:01:31] <Matt|home> "Sailor Galaxia was always the most powerful of the Sailor Scouts, and in some ways, she's even more powerful once she is taken over by Chaos and becomes evil. But at the end of the series, she survives the experience and Chaos is expelled from her body"
[13:01:34] <Matt|home> yeah but didn't sailor moon beat her
[13:01:39] <emmeka> Matt|home I'm not sure "most powerful" even matters in Sailor Moon, it's all about ~the power of feelings~ or whatever and power difference change arbitrarily based on mood

[13:05:51] <emmeka> Matt|home I watched the original broadcast here too, but the DIC dub censored shit anyway. Thankfully, Viz redubbed the whole thing from start to finish a while ago, and did a great job. I watched it as they released it so it's not that distant to me.
[13:08:37] <emmeka> Matt|home Saturn is like the guardian of death or some shit and half the plot of season 3 is trying to stop her from awakening because Sailor Saturn has the power to just kill the universe unilaterally, but then ~the power of friendship~ saves her from her own dark powers, or whatever
[13:11:11] <Matt|home> gotcha
[13:11:26] <Matt|home> so who'd win in a fight.. galaxia or saturn
[13:11:40] <death916> moon
[13:11:44] <Matt|home> damn straight

[13:12:18] <death916> wheres amigojapan 
[13:12:21] <death916> he would settle this
[13:13:13] <emmeka> Matt|home Saturn. She straight up announces that she could definitely obliterate Galaxia, but it would probably kill herself in the process. Chibi Usa stops her from doing this even though it'd be k because Sailor Moon could revive her anyway, but whatevs
[13:13:42] <Matt|home> :p
[13:13:44] <Matt|home> brb
[13:15:40] <amigojapan> Hi death916 let me see
[13:15:56] <emmeka> amigojapan missed the Sailor Moon fanart and Sailor Moon talk
[13:16:23] <emmeka> JesseDesu did you link amigo your Sailor Saturn fanart? He'll probably appreciate it.
[13:16:33] <JesseDesu> he saw it twice
[13:16:36] <death916> sup amigojapan i figured we needed your expertise
[13:16:44] <amigojapan> I saw it emmeka 
[13:16:55] <JesseDesu> i drew sailormoon a year ago
[13:17:03] <JesseDesu> it doesnt look as good
[13:17:15] <emmeka> I have a half finished drawing of Sailor Uranus that I keep not finishing
[13:17:22] <amigojapan> death916: emmeka is right. If Saturn uses her power she could win. But she would die
[13:17:43] <emmeka> if she tried hard enough, everyone else would die too
[13:18:02] <emmeka> that's kind of the problem with her powers, she can just kill everyone and controlling it is not very doable
[13:18:11] <death916> i didnt know whe was so op
[13:18:19] <death916> im still gonan go with moon cuz MC alwyas wins

[13:18:54] <emmeka> well she gets like no actual battle screentime, but yeah. Sailor Saturn is basically the antagonist of the third season and then she shows up again in the final season for like a few episodes.
[13:19:20] <amigojapan> death916: have you seen it yet
[13:19:28] <JesseDesu> how many seasons are there
[13:19:33] <JesseDesu> what years did it run
[13:19:36] <JesseDesu> 1992-?
[13:19:48] <emmeka> JesseDesu 5, and I think 92-98?
[13:19:58] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: it hard 5 arcs. Not seasons
[13:20:00] <death916> no
[13:20:05] <JesseDesu> did the animation get better towards 98
[13:20:15] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: total 200 episodes
[13:20:27] <emmeka> amigojapan that's not true, there's several seasons which have multiple arcs within them
[13:20:32] <JesseDesu> rapid advancements of cg occured right around 98
[13:20:36] <emmeka> R has two different story arcs in 1 season
[13:20:56] <emmeka> JesseDesu the animation got higher budget as the seasons went on, it really shows in the later movies.
[13:21:39] <emmeka> but it doesn't really matter
[13:21:48] <emmeka> like 25% of every episode is stock clips anyway
[13:22:09] <death916> gundam is like that
[13:22:22] <death916> im watchign all of gundam uc and og gundam they reuse the laucnh and shootign scened 5 times an episode
[13:22:29] <death916> zeta not as bad
[13:22:31] <death916> but still alot
[13:23:09] <death916> they reuse face reaction shots in battle 
[13:23:25] <emmeka> every attack scene and every transformation scene in Sailor Moon is the exact same stock animation re-used continuously throughout any given season.
[13:23:31] <death916> lmao

[13:24:09] <death916> w
[13:24:14] <JesseDesu> is it?
[13:24:49] <JesseDesu> "I will punish you!"
[13:24:53] <emmeka> death916 I'd say these take up at least 10% of any episode's runtime, but sometimes, the show needs to fill up some time... so you get every single character's transformation sequence in full, instead of just 1 or 2 of them, or a quick cut between all of them
[13:24:55] <JesseDesu> oh yea punish me baby
[13:25:29] <death916> he every character transofrmation scenes r so gratuitous
[13:25:52] <death916> power rangers tpok that to heart and did 10 mins team transforms also
[13:26:08] <death916> 22 min runtime 12 min transformatins
[13:26:18] <emmeka> p much
[13:27:06] <emmeka> watching all of Sailor Moon means watching Sailor Moon's transformation sequence stock clip like, literally 200 times, but I'm not even mad it's great
[13:28:15] <emmeka> JesseDesu that's Crystal, though.
[13:28:24] <JesseDesu> power rangers was 1993
[13:28:27] <JesseDesu> i remember it
[13:28:40] <JesseDesu> it was the talk of my 3rd grade class
[13:29:09] <JesseDesu> in 1994 they came out with VR Troopers
[13:30:06] <emmeka> JesseDesu "Sailor Moon Eternal" is just the remake version of season 4, which was SuperS.
[13:30:30] <emmeka> the consensus is that the original is better, and the remake lacks all charm
[13:31:17] <emmeka> it's basically just a cashgrab which cuts out all the "filler" which basically made the series good, and speedruns the main plot
[13:31:28] <Macer> transformation montages are easy filler for lazy animation studios
[13:32:09] <emmeka> meh, we're talking about a series that aired basically every week for like 5 years, they're allowed
[13:32:19] <Macer> recaps are even worse. things like bleach would recap the previous episode for 10 minutes
[13:32:44] <emmeka> it also aired alongside the manga's publication, so it's not like animators could work ahead of the source material
[13:32:47] <JesseDesu> recap the recap
[13:32:51] <Macer> emmeka: yah well. i guess if people kept watching it :) 
[13:33:17] <Macer> JesseDesu: didn't they do that with their welcome back from the break in this story arc episodes?
[13:33:29] <JesseDesu> wut wut
[13:33:31] <JesseDesu> i dunno
[13:33:48] <emmeka> Sailor Moon was nice with recaps, they did them sparingly, and always alongside other content. When they did a recap for season 4, they did it as a 1 hour special where 16 minutes of it was a recap of the prior seasons, and then there were 2 original mini episodes.
[13:33:51] <Macer> i wish someoen would just crush down bleach seasons into 2 hours
[13:33:55] <Macer> which is all the new content you get anyways
[13:34:05] <Macer> and turn them into movies :) 
[13:34:37] <Macer> i'm surprised that isn't a thing yet
[13:34:51] <JesseDesu> is there any rule 34
[13:35:35] <Macer> emmeka: well most of the long stretching never ending anime recap every episode for 10 minutes :) 
[13:35:54] <Macer> like an episode of bleach or naruto was only like 7-10 minutes after intro, recap, outro 
[13:37:03] <emmeka> Macer in ye olde days though, this was actually useful.
[13:37:04] <Macer> i didn't care much for naruto... but i liked bleach up until i noticed that i was ffw through the first 10 min of every episode 
[13:37:41] <Macer> emmeka: useful for a studio to save money? because it really took away from the episodes 
[13:38:46] <emmeka> Macer it didn't in ye olde days when you watched a weekly broadcast on Adult Swim and that was basically the only way to actually watch anime, and there was no garauntee when you sat down to watch an episode of your preferred shounen garbage that you had watched the episode before it
[13:39:52] <emmeka> any sort of longrunning series had to do that kind of thing by necessity, because it was basically impossible to not miss episodes
[13:39:59] <emmeka> or watch them perfectly in order
[13:40:46] <emmeka> not like American TV where you could just catch a rerun later in the day or week, you got like 1 late night timeslot for your show on 1 channel and that was it.

[17:40:36] <darkwitch> is that similar to being the crown price of korea?
[17:40:45] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it's discrimination against women

[17:55:29] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I have trouble with old Japanese sometimes. I can't understand everything the emperor said when the us made him say he is not a God. It's hard
[17:56:58] <Bco1981> the us made him say he is not a God... i thought he was ?
[17:57:14] <JesseDesu> pearl harbor and 9/11 lost a similar amount of lives
[17:57:19] <Bco1981> he thought he was ?
[17:58:20] <amigojapan> Bco1981: according to the kojiki they are related to the gods that's made the world
[17:59:02] <amigojapan> Bco1981: when the US won ww2 they made him say "I am not God"on the radio
[18:00:53] <darkwitch> it's not important if he is or not
[18:01:37] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it was important for the Japanese people of the time to accept defeat
[18:02:49] <amigojapan> Also it basically obliterated shintoism 
[18:03:11] <darkwitch> what matters is what people think he is, as they will act according to what they think is reality

[18:57:20] <name100> darkwitch: 22 earth
[18:57:30] <ButterNoodle> and easily accessible to the rich
[18:57:43] <ButterNoodle> but expensive for the middle class
[18:58:05] <ButterNoodle> and by middle class.. I mean anyone that makes between 40K and 400K a year
[18:58:24] <JesseDesu> if you tattoo "No Code" on your chest they wont revive you if you get into a coma
[18:58:40] <JesseDesu> or something like that
[18:58:50] <ButterNoodle> but its a la carte.. you can pay for as much or as little healthcare as you want.. and not get taxed at 40+ percent for it
[18:59:33] <ButterNoodle> japan has a minimum standard of healthcare that everyone gets at a fairly reasonable tax cost
[19:00:00] <ButterNoodle> I dont think many other places in the world have social healthcare at as reasonable of a cost as japan

[19:05:23] <ButterNoodle> would have though someone that is infatuated with their son
[19:05:24] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: in Japanese those words are not sexual
[19:05:34] <amigojapan> Yeah Bco1981

[19:07:35] <ButterNoodle> woah
[19:07:39] <JesseDesu> is youtube and twitch basically the same, in that both have stream and or upload full video
[19:07:41] <Bco1981> amigojapan: yeah i heard about them from hololive Calli, then i found i could get some from a some internet shop.
[19:07:41] <ButterNoodle> coming from an asian nation?
[19:07:43] <saganman> amigojapan: I am lucky to find my twitter handle still available
[19:07:52] <amigojapan> saganman: really? Can you give me the new one by pm?
[19:08:22] <ButterNoodle> I thought in a lot of asian countries they took care of their parents to old age.. or maybe they just mean at a younger age idk
[19:08:25] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it's really strong
[19:08:29] <name100> ppl r fine
[19:08:45] <ButterNoodle> name100: you just have to cook them properly
[19:08:54] <Bco1981> amigojapan: but, it's just 9%
[19:09:01] <JesseDesu> i'm thinking about streaming drawings on twitch
[19:09:16] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they mean cause people keep telling their moms "I love you mom"
[19:09:31] <JesseDesu> someone wanted to commission me here but after i gave them my price they backed down
[19:09:33] <ButterNoodle> well
[19:10:21] <ButterNoodle> japanese dont use those words often
[19:11:45] <JesseDesu> i priced my commissions the same hourly rate as my day job's salary equivelent
[19:12:40] <JesseDesu> its a high starting point
[19:12:44] <JesseDesu> which is why i never get work
[19:13:09] <saganman> ButterNoodle: here we are obliged to take care of the elder parents
[19:13:15] <JesseDesu> at the same time i'll never complain about underselling myself
[19:13:25] <saganman> ButterNoodle: I think there are even laws for it
[19:13:58] <mixfix41> ive heard about a streamer talk about that. they had a story about in school and drawing logos for a competition and it was a bogus competition they took the logos and they appear time later
[19:14:29] <JesseDesu> contests are a way to make people work for free
[19:14:48] <JesseDesu> dont participate
[19:17:20] <Bco1981> i ordered 4 of those strong zero, 4 different tastes.

[19:18:25] <Jigsy> This.
[19:18:33] <Jigsy> WAKE. UP. PEOPLE.
[19:21:23] <JesseDesu> Jigsy, do you agree
[19:21:24] <Bco1981> creative contests, it's not like archer contests will give any free work
[19:21:58] <Jigsy> I do agree.
[19:22:06] <JesseDesu> i heard it from a college professor
[19:22:41] <Jigsy> Was reading some comment on reddit about how some guy quit some "Honor society" thing.
[19:22:52] <Jigsy> And people were telling him he'd miss this "great opportunity."
[19:23:08] <Jigsy> Which was to work for 60 hours doing community work and then write a ten page essay on it.
[19:23:10] *** Quits: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:23:41] <Jigsy> much opportunity such wow
[19:25:01] <analoq> it's not that simple imho. ppl ususally try to get something out of it. e.g. polish their cv
[19:25:23] <analoq> enjoy the competition etc.
[19:25:27] <JesseDesu> polish sausage
[19:25:36] <analoq> you can only do that so often

[19:28:20] <DaPinkOne> you actually count strokes?
[19:28:32] <JesseDesu> theres a stroke counter built into procreate
[19:28:36] <JesseDesu> and a timer
[19:28:47] <DaPinkOne> time seems a more reasonable metric
[19:28:56] <JesseDesu> pricing is a dark art
[19:28:58] <DaPinkOne> you've gotta spend time planning the piece, right?

[19:33:40] <JesseDesu> my shit will be famous when i die
[19:33:42] <JesseDesu> probably
[19:33:48] <JesseDesu> i'll never know

[19:50:30] <JesseDesu> nanobot is gonna retire in el salvador
[19:50:31] <Nanobot> This doesn't mean the price will enter those ranges, just that those ranges are where people will be looking to buy.
[19:52:17] <JesseDesu> i hope bitcoin gets taxed the fuck out of its profitability
[19:52:23] <mixfix41> yeah thats news for market penetration
[19:52:41] <mixfix41> so in restaurants they can get meas with bitcoin
[19:52:45] <DaPinkOne> btc is still hella volitile isn't it?
[19:52:45] <mixfix41> meals

[19:53:16] <mixfix41> JesseDesu: look at elon musk
[19:53:30] <mixfix41> he rode the success i guess
[19:53:32] <JesseDesu> what was elon musks net worth at 12
[19:53:36] <mixfix41> hes successful
[19:53:47] <mixfix41> well i dont but his is early success and risk taking story
[19:53:57] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, didn't his parents own an emerald mine or some shit in apartheid south africa?
[19:54:03] <JesseDesu> elon musk's story is still being written
[19:54:20] <mixfix41> maybe, he hires really smart people if i research correct
[19:54:21] <JesseDesu> yea, no doubt DaPinkOne 
[19:54:49] <JesseDesu> he hit the ground running 
[19:55:04] <DaPinkOne> i don't think a 12 year old conventionally has a "net worth", as they don't legally own businesses and stuff
[19:55:28] <DaPinkOne> I guess if his parents kicked the bucket and left it to him
[19:55:36] <JesseDesu> didnt trump get a million dollar gift from an uncle or something while in high school
[19:56:12] <JesseDesu> life is fair
[19:56:13] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, trump's got a long history of loans, and somehow getting away with not paying them back
[19:56:23] <JesseDesu> you get one life to live
[19:57:06] <DaPinkOne> yeah, if only we could've lucked out and rolled a different caste
[19:57:12] <JesseDesu> rags to riches stories are more interesting
[19:57:29] <DaPinkOne> yeah, they make fun stories, but they're lies, more often than not
[19:57:29] <analoq> DaPinkOne: he owns so much that it screws over the ppl who granted them :P
[19:57:39] <JesseDesu> just look at bill gates/steve jobs/jay-z
[19:58:21] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, bill gates was pretty well off, and wozniak did all the work. Steve jobs was a UI design guy 
[19:58:38] <JesseDesu> NeXT
[19:58:41] <DaPinkOne> I don't know anything about jay-z. I don't keep up with the kids
[19:59:10] <JesseDesu> its a hard knock life
[19:59:14] <mixfix41> linus made the kernel then got us citizen ship. all of us didnt have to make a kernel
[19:59:15] <JesseDesu> what movie was that
[19:59:18] <JesseDesu> annie or something
[19:59:33] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, yeah, that was annie.

[20:00:11] <DaPinkOne> mixfix41, linus for sure got it goin. He's still got a heavy hand in it, but I think he'll be retiring soon
[20:00:29] <JesseDesu> what is linus' net worth
[20:00:34] <DaPinkOne> there's been talk of who will be his successor, since he's getting up there in years
[20:00:56] <DaPinkOne> https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/linus-torvalds-net-worth/ 50 mil

[20:01:05] <DaPinkOne> he makes ~1.5 mil/year
[20:01:12] <JesseDesu> not bad
[20:01:34] <amigojapan> mixfix41: he did not make the kernel for the US
[20:01:37] <analoq> DaPinkOne: we have a similar issue. a product that is basically not sellable, but we keep developing it. because noone responsible wants to pull the plug :p
[20:01:37] <JesseDesu> 80,000 code fixes a year
[20:01:46] <DaPinkOne> he's the BDFL of several beloved community projects
[20:02:00] <JesseDesu> a what
[20:02:02] <analoq> because if they do someone will ask, 'who is responsible for burning millions' :D
[20:02:46] <DaPinkOne> mixfix41, I don't know why he'd need or want US citizenship. he's from finland
[20:03:02] <analoq> maybe he likes paying more taxes
[20:03:20] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: does he live in silicon valley?
[20:04:11] <DaPinkOne> seems he did get US citizenship in 2010
[20:04:21] <amigojapan> Yup
[20:04:59] <DaPinkOne> I dunno where he lives. I imagine it'd be near their office, if they have one, but the work could well be fully remote.
[20:05:35] <Sadale> So the USB WiFi Dongle I've purchased has arrived.
[20:05:45] <analoq> cg :3
[20:05:51] <mixfix41> hes a cat person too why are the most smart inventor always accompany by cats and not dogs
[20:06:17] <Sadale> I've managed to get one that's a bit bigger, with external antenna which I've found not quite helpful. It supports dual band. And it's only as expensive as the previous ones that I've got.
[20:06:26] <DaPinkOne> mixfix41, a well trained cat is fluffy and takes care of itself mostly. a well trained dog still needs attention
[20:06:28] <JesseDesu> sadale dont play with your dongle too much
[20:06:43] <Sadale> I'll need to test it in another room some days later so I could check its performance.
[20:06:44] <mixfix41> DaPinkOne: i know but i cant keep cats their too flaky
[20:06:45] <Sadale> JesseDesu, why?
[20:07:05] <mixfix41> im allergic to their dandruff i could even keep a sphinx
[20:07:12] <Sadale> So far I've tested this latest dongle I've purchased on linxu and Windows. It's so far so good.
[20:07:12] <DaPinkOne> Sadale, I think it's a dick joke.
[20:07:16] <JesseDesu> you might get infected
[20:07:19] <Sadale> DaPinkOne, oh
[20:08:20] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, the Linux Foundation is headquartered in San Francisco, so linus is probably over there somewhere
[20:08:33] <JesseDesu> it is?
[20:08:42] <JesseDesu> how come i live there and didnt know this
[20:08:56] <DaPinkOne> I'll bet he can affort a 2 bedroom apartment in san fran with that 1.5 mil/year

[20:15:30] <darkwitch> it might also turn him into a mosquito
[20:15:36] <mixfix41> thanks
[20:16:03] <mixfix41> for sure probs two big dogs when i have the time space and money. and then ill think about training sessions with other dogs
[20:16:11] <mixfix41> or one dog then training with other dogs
[20:16:21] <mixfix41> if i get a partner two for sure
[20:16:32] <amigojapan> darkwitch: he kills mosquitoes with mosquito rakets

[20:19:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Depends what. I passed my compsci classes. I'm probably very rusty though.
[20:19:50] <DaPinkOne> Aurora_v_kosmose, congrats! what classes did you have?
[20:20:54] <JesseDesu> what
[20:21:14] <JesseDesu> oh someone was asking for a mathmethtician
[20:21:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DaPinkOne: Been years, but the usual stats, calcs etc..

[20:21:56] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: mootpoot was last seen in ##anime 1 day and 13 hours ago: <MootPoot> only 2-3 more quests till I'm done playing chernobylite

[20:22:04] <JesseDesu> !seen ButterNoodle 
[20:22:04] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: ButterNoodle was last seen in ##anime 1 hour and 11 minutes ago: <ButterNoodle> japanese dont use those words often
[20:22:06] <DaPinkOne> i haven't taken stats yet. I took calc 1-4 and physics though
[20:22:26] <name100> fren is good
[20:22:30] <JesseDesu> i took business calculus in college
[20:22:36] <JesseDesu> it was brutal but i passed it
[20:22:48] <darkwitch> beer is your fren
[20:23:01] <DaPinkOne> wrapping your head around some of the concepts can be challenging
[20:23:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Physics wasn't required for my case. Which is good because I got through relatively well, but on the other hand not having a better grounding in physics is sometimes inconvenient.
[20:23:12] <JesseDesu> sometimes i get nightmares about taking a chemistry test i didnt study for
[20:23:30] <JesseDesu> i dont know what the fuck a plank is
[20:23:46] <DaPinkOne> Aurora_v_kosmose, I don't think it was required. I was required a "lab science", and I picked physics and electromagnetics. I could've chosen biology or chemistry

[20:24:00] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: tsunderenoises was last seen in ##anime 7 days and 23 hours ago: <TsundereNoises> it still sucks, but I think that's a big difference
[20:24:03] <JesseDesu> rip
[20:24:14] <mixfix41> being a physicists rewards are for lifetime projects comparing to a sysadmin where results are return every task or so
[20:24:31] <mixfix41> i was gonna say programmer but im not a programmer
[20:25:01] <JesseDesu> i hate to think about being a sysadmin, what if your company gets hacked and you are soley to blame
[20:25:12] <analoq> iksdeee
[20:25:26] <DaPinkOne> JesseDesu, it's not IF the company gets hacked. It's WHEN the company gets hacked.
[20:25:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: So long as you're compliant with regulations they don't give a fuck.
[20:25:45] <analoq> it doesnt matter that you get hacked. as long as you can show that you aren't at fault
[20:25:45] <JesseDesu> internet security is a losing battle

[20:26:07] <DaPinkOne> there are generally plans in place. backups taken, disaster recovery plans in case of various problems
[20:26:12] <analoq> thats where the joke 'no one ever got fire for buying ibm' comes from
[20:26:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Security in corporate world is mostly a joke.
[20:26:31] <JesseDesu> whats the worst that can happen
[20:26:43] * Aurora_v_kosmose giggles
[20:26:44] <Sadale> Aurora_v_kosmose++
[20:26:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I love that question.
[20:26:53] <JesseDesu> you get infiltrated to the kernel level
[20:27:01] <Sadale> most companies simply don't give a shit about security.
[20:27:07] <analoq> it's also important to always ask for it security stuff that you know you wont get. because if something goes wrong you can say 'well, thats why i asked for xyz'
[20:27:24] <mixfix41> best bet is just be a sysadmin in whatever endeavor you enter
[20:27:25] <Sadale> lol that's a right thing to do
[20:27:30] <mixfix41> we re all sysadmins
[20:27:43] <DaPinkOne> Sadale, unfortunately, security doesn't sell, 'cause if it's working, it's either annoying as shit, or it's invisible
[20:28:03] <Sadale> true. And most often it'd be the latter.
[20:28:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> More importantly, security has costs and their priority is shoveling out crapware as fast as it can be made.
[20:28:42] <analoq> DaPinkOne: oh it sells just fine. it's a huge market.
[20:28:44] <DaPinkOne> mixfix41, i'm not a sysadmin, but I know a guy
[20:29:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> analoq: You're selling certificates. They don't care. You shouldn't care. And they won't implement anything they're not legally required to implement.
[20:29:10] <DaPinkOne> i don't fuck with the home lab that much
[20:29:10] <analoq> but it's a 'we don't want it, but we have to buy it' kind of market
[20:29:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you make the mistake of caring, you'll just be disappointed how they don't even bother to fix shit you point out so long as it isn't against some sort of legal regulation.
[20:30:01] <DaPinkOne> analoq, well yeah, they don't want it provable that they were negligent, 'cause then that kind of lawsuit could be expensive
[20:30:19] <analoq> Aurora_v_kosmose: we exist in a similar market. companys must have certain products. but they don't really like spending money on them. they are simply a necessity
[20:30:31] <analoq> DaPinkOne: yep
[20:31:10] <Nanobot> The nearby wildfire has been burning for over 2 months now and is still growing.
[20:31:23] <analoq> is it nearby for 2month? :p
[20:31:33] <Nanobot> It's in the next county over.
[20:31:49] <Nanobot> But we've been dealing with smoke from it for two months now
[20:31:50] <analoq> i hope ur not too close to the border ^_^
[20:31:58] <analoq> yikes. 
[20:32:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> analoq: Yes, but their caring for that commodity comes not from an interest in making their things secure or doing things properly. It stems entirely from avoiding regulatory problems and lawsuits.
[20:32:12] <JesseDesu> i want a sysadmin job where all i do is wait for an email from a realtime intrusion detection system
[20:32:23] <analoq> Aurora_v_kosmose: i totally agree
[20:32:57] <Nanobot> It's the second biggest wildfire in California history. More than double the size of the third biggest, and getting close to #1.
[20:33:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's the kind of thing I find infuriating. It's also one of the reasons I recommend against centralized corporate solutions whenever possible.
[20:33:25] <DaPinkOne> california's the new australia
[20:33:35] <Nanobot> #1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were all in 2020.
[20:33:52] <Nanobot> #3 was 2018
[20:34:13] <DaPinkOne> it's been drying up for years, and they didn't really clear out all that underbrush
[20:34:19] <analoq> Nanobot: i wonder how long it takes for it to turn to live again afterwards. it must take a long time for seeds to reconquer a huge incinerated areal right?
[20:34:25] <analoq> life*
[20:34:38] <Nanobot> DaPinkOne: Underbrush? Entire national forests are all burning up
[20:35:02] <DaPinkOne> analoq, it depends on the plants and how hot the fire gets. red woods need fire to drop seeds IIRC
[20:35:43] <DaPinkOne> Nanobot, i'm not a treeologist, and have done no research on this topic.
[20:35:52] <DaPinkOne> we're fucked though

[20:38:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> One of the issues with high-heat large forest fires is that they can dry-up the soil in such a fashion it doesn't absorb water properly again.
[20:38:59] <Nanobot> What's water?
[20:39:10] <JesseDesu> i should probably delete all the 10gb log files of failed bruteforce attempts on my digital ocean droplet
[20:39:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: Something plants need to live and produce caffeine, which we require to make the elixir of life.
[20:39:34] <Nanobot> California doesn't have any of that.
[20:39:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Or at least use logrotate and lzma2/xz compression.
[20:39:41] <DaPinkOne> Aurora_v_kosmose, coffee or tea?
[20:39:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DaPinkOne: Both, but not at the same time.
[20:39:54] <JesseDesu> plants make caffeine as their natural insecticide
[20:40:17] <analoq> little did they know :D
[20:40:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Text generally compresses pretty well, so the logs being rotated could stay for a while longer.
[20:40:36] <JesseDesu> Aurora_v_kosmose, i havent logged into my droplet in like 7 months
[20:40:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: You can also configure logrotate so that once it reaches a certain size of compressed files it'll trim some.
[20:40:45] <JesseDesu> i'm a fire and forget user
[20:40:54] <Nanobot> Logs especially tend to compress well, since there tends to be a lot of repetition.
[20:40:56] <JesseDesu> logrotate?
[20:41:10] <JesseDesu> is that a command available in ubuntu
[20:41:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> man 8 logrotate
[20:41:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes, it's a pretty standard daemon utility.
[20:41:40] <Nanobot> Why did man do that? logrotate doesn't even taste good.
[20:41:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: Run that in your terminal, you'll get the point.
[20:42:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, assuming your distro has it installed by default.
[20:42:16] <JesseDesu> i need to login to my droplet

[21:55:04] <DaPinkOne> cow_2001, it wouldn't be the first time a manga artist has made up a book as a plot device.
[21:55:11] <DaPinkOne> I mean...they're literally writing a book.
[21:55:11] <snake> $5000 would do nicely for just a little while i think
[21:55:43] <cow_2001> DaPinkOne: i hope that in this case it is a real book. the person Hoshino Michio is real.
