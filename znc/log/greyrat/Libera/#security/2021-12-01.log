[14:17:54] <pagios> ello, what is the difference between client certifctes and server certifates
[14:25:39] <Tuor> Server certificates are used to identify a server. Client certificates are used to identify a client (pc, phone, what ever). Every website that uses HTTPS uses a server certificate, but most don't require the connecting clients to identify them selves.
[14:29:50] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[14:29:51] <pagios> Tuor: thanks, i am using netscaler with a *.domain.com certifcate and serve https to my servers sitting behind the reverse proxy. that is considered a server certificte right?
[14:30:51] <Tuor> a *.domain.com is in general called a wildcard certificate, which is a special kind fo server certificate.
[14:31:12] <pagios> yes where should it sit ? in the server certicates window in netscaler?
[14:31:42] <Tuor> I don't know how netscaler works. Can't help you with it. sorry.

[14:37:59] <Tuor> If you want to know if a certificate is intended to be used as a client certificate: openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -noout -text and then look for the "X509v3 Extended Key Usage" part. Server certificates are often signed by a generally trusted root-CA. Your operating system has a list of trusted CAs. Mozilla for exmaple have there own list: https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/file/tip/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt. In general server
[14:37:59] <Tuor> certificates are sign by such a trusted CA. Client certificates are generally sign by an internal CA, so your internal CA has to be added to the truststore of the service the client shall be able to connect to.

[17:53:34] <locsmif> Permissions and ownership are all correct: we checked the user under which nginx and php8.0-fpm are running, chown'ed that properly, as well even set everything to mode 777 for testing
[17:54:06] <locsmif> Stuff does work if he puts it under /var/www isntead
[17:54:51] <locsmif> nginx returns a 404, strace shows access denied when attempting to access e.g. /home/coworker/Projects/theproject/src/public/index.php

[17:56:00] <locsmif> Never mind for now, I'm asking #nginx as well, I'm probably overlooking something
[17:58:45] <Apachez> out of the blue when it comes to webservers they often want +x in order to read the directory
[17:58:53] <Apachez> otherwise they cannot traverse into that
[17:59:04] <Apachez> so I would assume that the directory itself of /var/www is +x all the way

[17:59:33] <locsmif> We tested with rwxrwxrwx
[17:59:53] <locsmif> We tested the user/group in relation to the nginx and php8.0-fpm processes
[17:59:54] <Apachez> can also be which groups the user itself is part of according to /etc/group
[18:00:06] <Apachez> usually I never had any issues with home dirs when using apache
[18:00:13] <Apachez> dunno if nginx would do things differently
[18:00:16] <locsmif> Hmm
[18:00:30] <Apachez> apparmor is like selinux, often included but often disabled (or only enabled for a few services)
[18:01:01] <Apachez> the /etc/group thingy is a common fix when usb host doesnt work with virtualbox even if you installed extensions
[18:01:17] <Apachez> the user must be part of virtualbox group and then reboot the box for that to have effect
[18:01:25] <Apachez> perhaps something similar here?
[18:01:25] <s1gyn> Have you confirmed that it is indeed apparmor's fault?
[18:01:34] <Apachez> yeah disable apparmor as a test
[18:04:35] <locsmif> No, I have not confirmed it
[18:04:46] <locsmif> In fact, I doubt it at this point, but my co-worker has already left
[18:05:10] <locsmif> I can't test now, perhaps some facl or selinux issue could also be at play, I don't know
[18:05:30] <MadCamel> most likely /home/coworker isn't o+x
[18:06:00] <MadCamel> easy way to check permissions is to just set a shell for the www-data user and su to it
[18:06:37] <locsmif> sudo -u www-data bash would also work
[18:06:39] <s1gyn> I am very ignorant about apparmor. I do know selinux though.

[21:55:41] <riotz-> i'm searching for something that doesnt simply compare mac adresses
[21:56:08] <riotz-> but goes a little deeper by sniffing packets
[21:56:43] <fu-donky-suckers> isn't that what snort is for
[21:57:17] <riotz-> not that i know of.. snort is an ids for internal network monitoring
[21:57:37] <riotz-> what i want is to sniff wifi packets like lets say aircrack does
[21:58:00] <riotz-> or kismet
[21:58:19] <riotz-> kismet has some rogue ap detection i just dont know how it internaly works

[22:00:01] <riotz-> if there is it has to use the unsupported esp api that supported sniffing packets
[22:00:07] <riotz-> no tcpdump wont work there either
[22:00:10] <riotz-> wtf guys
[22:00:57] <riotz-> i mean you may be able to detect that youre inside a rouge app after its to late with those apps
[22:00:59] <riotz-> but thats to late
[22:02:18] <fu-donky-suckers> well google pays a big team of people to detect rogue apps.  And they still don't do it that good
[22:02:24] <fu-donky-suckers> you think you can do it better?
[22:02:38] <riotz-> i dunno enough about wifi packets right now

[22:10:40] <fu-donky-suckers> it'd take me about 5 minutes to isolate it and figure it out.  maybe 10.

[22:11:27] <riotz-> yeah its visible that you dont know what youre talking about
[22:11:36] <MadCamel> google goes through great lengths to ensure apps are not evil. You're not going to beat their automated detection engine/behavior analysis sandbox. So that leaves manual methods. Decompile the apk and examine it for funny stuff. Network sniffing - ehh, most everything's via TLS and many apps use pinned certs.

[22:13:08] <MadCamel> roge ap not app. Hah
[22:13:16] <riotz-> rogue ap is an wifi access point that fakes the same ssid
[22:13:19] <MadCamel> I should read more carefully.
[22:13:21] *** Joins: richterbyron (~Rheanna@218.78.104.50)
[22:14:34] <MadCamel> Best way is to ensure it's a WPA3 AP.
[22:16:56] <riotz-> that doesnt protect you either
[22:18:01] <riotz-> afaik..
[22:18:13] <riotz-> why should it anyways
[22:18:36] <riotz-> well.. to be true i probably search for some little more then all this
[22:18:55] <riotz-> lets say an attacker knows your wifi pasword
[22:19:17] <riotz-> he fakes the access point to you connect to by using a stronger antenna
[22:19:25] <riotz-> and plays arround with your packets
[22:19:31] <riotz-> how do you detect him
[22:19:49] <fu-donky-suckers> you just encrypt anything you want to
[22:19:51] <fu-donky-suckers> and don't care
[22:19:56] <riotz-> this isnt even a rogue ap detector i guess
[22:19:59] <fu-donky-suckers> it's easier
[22:20:22] <MadCamel> management frame protection provides at least some protection. If a client is associated with the real AP there's no way to get it to switch to the evil twin AP unless you go and unplug the one you've cloned.
[22:20:23] <spare> whitelist of station mac addresses + whitelist of access point addresses ; single node in mon anytime it see's your assets connect to not your assets flood deauth, right the way up till wpa3 prevents it
[22:21:17] <MadCamel> they keying just won't work until a reassociation/reauthentication happens and there's no way to force a deauth.
[22:21:21] <fu-donky-suckers> unless he's the NSA he's not going to break your end to end encryption
[22:21:29] <fu-donky-suckers> maybe if he's chinese or russian or israeli too
[22:21:41] <fu-donky-suckers> just encrypt your shit and connect to whatever ap
[22:21:51] <riotz-> spare mac adresses are not a protection at all
[22:22:00] <riotz-> you can fake them all thos easyly

[22:24:57] <spare> you can rogue ap by hosting the same bssid and ssid on a seperate channel
[22:25:45] <riotz-> yes but lets say you want to stay undetected then you simply use the same channel and mac as the target
