[00:10:54] <UrielCorinthian> PerfDave - 2, 3, & 4 are HDDs. 500GB, 250GB, 250GB combined into a 1TB volume

[00:12:45] <UrielCorinthian> PerfDave, the idea is to use the volume as data storage for an OwnCloud installation and the other hard drive as the system drive. I have another 1TB drive that I want to add to the volume as soon as I've backed up the data and made sure everything is good with the drive
[00:14:05] *** Quits: ooGoop9 (~realident@user/oogoop9) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:14:10] <PerfDave> UrielCorinthian: So you're using LVM to provide RAID striping across three old drives? That's.... brave
[00:14:34] <PerfDave> If any one of those drives fails, all your 1TB volume is screwed
[00:17:14] <PerfDave> And given the capacities, I'm guessing they're not new drives.
[00:17:36] <UrielCorinthian> PerfDave, to be honest, I don't know WHAT I'm doing :)) I just wanted to see what was possible. And I've actually been surprised by what's worked so far... Does LVM offer a "striping with parity" option to protect against that possibility? I went with LVM because of what I read about ease of resizing and expansion

[00:20:17] <jelly> so that's a luks container as well
[00:20:52] <UrielCorinthian> jelly, did I do it twice then...? Did I encrypt something inside another encrypted thing...?
[00:20:57] <jelly> it's more typical to have all the PVs encrypted and then joined to a VG
[00:21:22] <PerfDave> UrielCorinthian: I've not really tried to use LVM for RAID-type things so I can't answer that question. If I *absolutely* had to try and make this setup work, I'd split the 500GB drive into two 250GB partitions, RAID1 each partition with a 250GB drive, then RAID0 the two RAID1s to give me 500GB of mirrored storage, then use LUKS + LVM on top of that.
[00:21:25] <UrielCorinthian> jelly, so it sounds like I'll be better off just restarting this part of the process, yes?
[00:21:40] <PerfDave> UrielCorinthian: But I'd probably just go away and buy 2x 1TB drives if I needed to store that much information that I actually cared about.
[00:21:58] <PerfDave> UrielCorinthian: (also, look at Nextcloud rather than Owncloud, seems to be better maintained and more featureful)
[00:22:00] <jelly> no, you seem to have encrypted the LV on top of unencrypted PVs in this VG, so there's not double encryption
[00:22:52] <jelly> I do not know if LVM can make a raid1-like mirror out of two small and one larger PV
[00:23:12] <jelly> it probably can, but #lvm channel will know.
[00:23:17] <PerfDave> Something like OpenZFS as Kephra mentioned might be a sensible idea for this very weird use case.
[00:23:24] <jelly> yes
[00:23:42] <UrielCorinthian> Okay. Perhaps I should rather look into zfs then
[00:23:46] <PerfDave> TBH I'd start with just redoing your /dev/sda as LVM-on-LUKS as nature (and the Debian installer) intended
[00:23:48] <jelly> my stack usually looks like md raid, then luks on top, then LVM

[00:25:03] *** Joins: robertross (~robertros@104.254.8.73)
[00:25:13] <PerfDave> Yeah, I have RAID1 for the system disk and RAID6 for the storage on my "big" fileserver
[00:25:17] <UrielCorinthian> PerfDave, cool. I think I should do that. I haven't actually set anything else up on this system yet. Just the Debian base. Wanted to try and get a good grasp on all the LUKS and LVM stuff first before I continued
[00:25:55] <PerfDave> UrielCorinthian: Basically, the easiest way to think of it is as lots of layers doing different jobs, where each layer doesn't know or care what's above or below it.
[00:25:56] <jelly> I mean you _should_ be able to stack things this way, but some scripts and initrd startup might need to be customized
[00:26:11] <UrielCorinthian> It won't be a critical server in any way. It's really just to take some of the load off my primary storage and move non-important, large things out of the way
[00:26:27] <PerfDave> RAID gives you redundancy, LUKS gives you easy repartitioning, LUKS gives you encryption
[00:27:05] <jelly> on the other hand, zfs does all the layers, and has its own special benefits and pitfalls
[00:27:08] <PerfDave> Some technologies, like btrfs, ZFS etc., can do cool stuff by mixing those functions together, but you're probably better off getting to grips with the basics first IMHO.
[00:27:12] <UrielCorinthian> PerfDave, I wasn't TOO concerned with redundancy for now. If I get it all to work, when I have money again, I'll invest in hardware to do that
[00:27:35] <UrielCorinthian> I wanted to maximise usable space for now
[00:27:58] <UrielCorinthian> Didn't know ZFS also offers this
[00:28:42] <jelly> iunno if it allows for members with different sizes (while using the whole size thereof)
[00:29:01] <PerfDave> I know btrfs claims to with giant red warning lights
[00:29:19] <jelly> noone sane uses btrfs for important data
[00:30:00] <PerfDave> TBH nobody sane uses btrfs for any data :)
[00:30:15] <jelly> I do know people use it for ephemeral stuff, like bringing up dozens of similar VMs, doing something and then junking the whole set when it's done

[00:36:46] <PerfDave> UrielCorinthian: For your /dev/sda, do it the way the Debian installer sets it up :)
[00:37:07] <PerfDave> Basically: RAID if you want it, LUKS on top of that, LVM on top of LUKS. Don't forget to leave an unencrypted /boot
[00:38:05] <PerfDave> Pretty much every machine I have looks something like this: http://paste.debian.net/1226058/
[00:38:07] <UrielCorinthian> PerfDave, so you're suggesting the guided partitioning for sda?
[00:38:23] <jelly> if there's a single disk for OS, two partitions: one for /boot, one for LUKS then PV on top then VG from that PV then all the LVs in it.  And don't let the installer eat ALL THE SPACE IN VG for your /home
[00:38:38] <PerfDave> UrielCorinthian: Unless you have a reason not to, sure.

[01:55:46] <Khepra> alMalsamo: there's no longer any advantage to its use, and it requires host Os modification (running dom0). the cloud industry has mostly, if not completely, moved off Xen to KVM.
[01:56:56] <alMalsamo> Hmm I thought dom0 support was in upstream Linux kernel for many years already... when I first used Xen in ~2007 there was no dom0 OR domU support in the kernel and I had to compile myself, but that solved itself over time.
[01:56:58] <amacater_> KVM and virt-manager are ideal: I use them for cd image testing
[01:57:30] <rudi_s> alMalsamo: It's upstream in Linux, yes.
[01:57:59] <rudi_s> But as Khe<tab> said, Xen offers no advantages over KVM which is the default.
[01:58:08] <rudi_s> KVM also had a lot less vulnerabilities in the past.

[02:01:04] <Khepra> long time ago, I remember there were issues with kernel modules that didn't like dom0 environment, so you had to eitehr dedicate the machine to xen VMs or be able to run those.
[02:01:10] <rudi_s> No idea why you would prefer Xen, but yes.
[02:01:46] <Khepra> in that, when I said host OS requires modification, it's basically the host os has to be the (type 1) hypervisor itself, dom0, so it's not something you run atop of otherwise nonvirtualized OS
[02:02:22] <Khepra> bottom line is, if you go xen in 2022, you either need it specifically for some edge case unsatisfied by KVM, or youre locking yourself into dead end

[04:11:04] <celphi> yay!
[04:11:21] <jmcnaught> celphi: also generally on IRC you just tell us the problem.  If someone knows they'll help.  No need to ask to ask.
[04:11:34] <celphi> i have firmware bulleyes-debian
[04:11:46] <celphi> i've tried so many things to no avail
[04:12:38] <celphi> one of the strange parts is i have hciconfig shows something but it's down. and if i try to put up, it times out
[04:14:03] <celphi> if i try bluetooth power on i get no default adaptaer
[04:14:08] <jmcnaught> Has bluetooth ever worked on this computer?  Problem with just one device (what kind?) or all devices?
[04:14:18] <celphi> it's brand new computer
[04:14:29] <celphi> new *laptop
[04:14:37] <celphi> but answer to your question "no"
[04:15:01] <celphi> it has on/off switch in top right corner but nothing comes up
[04:15:26] <jmcnaught> What desktop environment or window manager are you using?
[04:15:36] <celphi> gnome debian
[04:17:30] <jmcnaught> celphi: look at "journalctl -b -g firmware" (as root) and see if there are any messages about missing firmware that could be for your bluetooth adapter.

[04:19:25] <celphi> jmcnaught: https://termbin.com/gl0a
[04:22:51] <jmcnaught> celphi: some of the messages are about loading firmwre for a MediaTek MT7961 which I looked up and seems to be both wifi and bluetooth, and others have had issues on Linux as well.
[04:23:35] <jmcnaught> celphi: a newer kernel from bullseye-backports might help: https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/
[04:23:56] <jmcnaught> !bpo kernel
[04:23:56] <dpkg> Newer kernels for Debian stable releases are available from the <bullseye-backports> repository.  After modifying your sources.list, run «apt update».  To install the current backported kernel: «apt -t bullseye-backports install linux-image-`uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,'`».  To list available backported kernel image packages: «aptitude search '?narrow(~nlinux-image,?origin(Debian Backports))'».

[04:24:58] <jmcnaught> celphi: 5.14 might not be new enough for working bluetooth so you might need to 1. compile a custom kernel 2. use a different bluetooth adapter for now 3. wait for newer kernel to hit backports
[04:25:40] <jmcnaught> celphi: You probably want to add "contrib non-free" to the end of that deb line (after main) so you can install newer non-free firmware packages too
[04:25:44] <Aarch64debian> can i debians arm64 for raspi .config for my 5.15 self build kernel

[04:35:31] <celphi> should i install those?
[04:35:39] <jmcnaught> celphi: personally I have all of those installed.  Read the description of each package with "apt show amd64-microcode" for example to see what they are.
[04:36:12] <jmcnaught> They're non-free, but they're also replacing/patching existing non-free code baked into your CPU

[13:29:37] <Khepra> I hope not
[13:30:50] <Khepra> but generally, there's no default packet filter in debian. afaik, the base system doesn't designate any one package for installation. meaning you're free to pull in whichever one you want.

[13:39:19] <Aarch64debian> the make menuconfig should be done before make j4, right
[13:40:50] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: some kind of .config should be produced before building, yes, whether it's via menu or some other way

[17:21:14] <PerfDave> If you're e.g. forwarding foo@mydomain.com to me@gmail.com then you'll want something that supports SRS, which last time I looked was easier with Postfix than Exim.
[17:21:25] <Khepra> no
[17:21:27] <tga> at a minimum, forwarding a list of addresses to actual mailboxes
[17:21:40] <Khepra> don't forward at all. SRS won't help and you'll be breaking SPF and DKIM records

[17:23:47] <Khepra> tga: right. don't do that, you'll lose mail.
[17:24:00] <tga> why?
[17:24:08] <Khepra> because "forwarding" breaks SPF and DKIM
[17:24:20] <tga> I am doing that already with the registrar, but I don't want all my mail passing through them
[17:24:36] *** Joins: remote (~self@user/hackers)
[17:24:41] <Khepra> registrars don't really care, they're offering a convenience service. they also break SPF and you lose mail
[17:25:02] <tga> oh hmm, I've been doing that for a while for a few domains
[17:25:16] <tga> no issues (that I know of)
[17:25:34] <Khepra> the only way this works properly if you own the recipient servers and can whitelist your registrar so that broken SPF is not rejected or spam score'd
[17:26:05] <tga> well my mail is not getting dropped, so they may do that for known registrars, maybe
[17:26:06] <Khepra> tga: that you know of, yes. this is isn't theoretical issue. it's actual issue that depends on how stric the recipient is set about SPF and how strict the sender is about their SPF record
[17:26:17] <tga> I understand
[17:27:07] <Khepra> for example, if I sent you email from your company domain's, it'd get rejected because we have strict SPF policy.  the $1M question is what do registrars do in those cases. do they fail the SMTP or they bounce back effectively beecoming backscatterers.
[17:27:37] <tga> would you mind trying to send me an email?
[17:27:41] <Khepra> also, registrars are often blacklisted so using them to send email to you, unless you whitelist them on the receipient side, is also going to pose problems

[17:46:13] <tga> gotcha, thanks
[17:46:23] <tga> looks like this is what the registrar is also using
[17:46:45] <Khepra> you actually need an MTA, there's no just "forwarder". that's why I asked if you neede generic transfer, or submission. if you wanted to "forward" locally generated email (submitted locally), then you could use something like:
[17:46:49] <Khepra> ,i dma

[17:48:48] <tga> that would be.. unfortunate
[17:49:04] <Khepra> postfix by default is very strict and it's hard to make it open relay. which means you'll need carefully crafted maps that override the default, and don't succumb to a generic catch-all forwarding rule turning you into open relay
[17:50:16] <tga> I was looking at something like proxmox mail gateway earlier, but it seems overkill for just a forwarder

[17:51:14] <PerfDave> tga: TBH, I'd just let your regristrar keep on doing what it's doing. It's unlikely you'll do any better without a lot of work.
[17:51:40] <Khepra> agreed on that
[17:52:33] <tga> no argument there, the main goal here would be to set up alias accounts I can block later
[17:52:37] <PerfDave> (he says, trying to set up a fully containerised mail server stack)
[17:52:42] <Khepra> especially if you forward spam and the recipient side starts learning your IP is a spammer, you'll blacklist yourself. proper spam mitigation takes a lot of time and experience, not just human admin's, but actual software experience: machine learning
[17:52:53] <tga> also a bit of extra privacy won't hurt, no reason to pass my mail through the registrar too
[17:53:49] <tga> only good thing there is that I need to forward to a single provider, and it's one where I can actually call someone
[17:54:41] <Khepra> tga: here's a $1M worth of advice: if you can set up a relay/forwarding MTA properly, you're just an `apt install dovecot` step away from hosting your own email and kicking your hosting middleman out.
[17:56:20] <tga> tempting, last time I had that working was in 2005
[17:56:45] <PerfDave> But "properly" is a high bar to meet and requires a lot of ongoing work.
[17:57:18] <PerfDave> The advantage of hosting your own IMAP server is that it's only your users who get pissy if spam ends up in their mailboxes, not other service providers who can and will blacklist you :0
[17:57:27] <Khepra> indeed. I'm an MTA admin of a system that's been set up and tweaked and tuned and machine learned for years. if you asked me today to start a new one from scratch, I'd laugh you out toward the general direction of GSuite or o365 :)

[17:58:21] <PerfDave> The main reason I self-host at home is because I'm an idiotic masochist
[17:58:40] * Khepra sees herself in that image, sadly.
[17:59:23] <tga> isn't it an option to send everything through a reputable provider?
[17:59:39] <Khepra> yeah but not by forwarding :)
[17:59:53] <Khepra> you do that via MX records so the reputable provider is handling the MX directly
[18:00:00] <tga> receiving doesn't sound like a pain for personal use, if you can tolerate spam
[18:00:17] <Khepra> true. but sending will be a huge PITA

[18:07:14] <PerfDave> Also if you're hosting your mailserver in a colo etc. you get a roll of the random dice as to whether the IP you've been allocated has *ever* been used for spamming, because those *never* get removed from blacklists no matter what they say.
[18:07:44] <Khepra> oh yeah. especially companies using Symantec products with blackliists generated in 2002 and never updated.
[18:08:07] <PerfDave> I seem to have gotten lucky with my new Hetzner box at least.
[18:08:46] <Khepra> BY THE WAY ... this applies equally to _forwarding_ because the very act of forward is forging the email to look like the recipient sent it through your IP. but it's, ultimately, _sending_ out, and thus vulnerable to aaaaaaall these issues. thus: don't forward :)
