[01:20:36] <meowcat> yes, we are kinda stuck with this virus now. my imagined good future involves sensible people getting a booster for new variants every few months.
[01:21:12] <kuudes> uk could close something down to get local spread back under control, I suppose
[01:21:13] <meowcat> as other mRNA vaccines are developed, maybe just get an update to your antivirus software twice a year.
[01:21:47] <kuudes> there is the option of cleaning locally and maintaining borders and then opening borders between clean areas - and with vaccines this is easier than before
[01:21:48] <rmmh> kuudes: it took so long to get local spread under control with a variant that was literally half the R0
[01:21:57] <meowcat> mRNA vaccines seem to generalize pretty well; maybe next year's booster will include HIV

[01:29:45] <pompolic> i do hope that the updates come with the requisite alarm fatigue
[01:29:46] <kuudes> if vaccine reduces lethality of covid by 1/24, then by https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3410/rr-6 it seems lethality of covid is about comparable to lethality to influenza post vaxx

[01:30:22] <rmmh> oh nice, someone wrote about this 11 months ago
[01:30:47] <meowcat> Moderna has vaccines in the work s for HIV, Zika, EBV, RSV, CMV, and some others.
[01:31:02] <momus> as well as a nasal spray for COVID-19.
[01:31:11] <kuudes> "The most detailed study of seasonal influenza mortality in NZ to date estimated average annual mortality of 13.5 (95%CI 13.4, 13.6) per 100,000 population [1]. Furthermore, the proportion of the NZ population infected with influenza in a year has been measured from a seroconversion study at 35% (95%CI: 32%-38%) [2]. Combining these figures suggests an IFR for seasonal influenza of about 0.039% (ie, 13.5/35,000) in NZ. This seasonal influenza IFR is 17 
[01:31:11] <kuudes> times lower than that estimated for COVID-19 at 0.68% [3] and 0.65% [4], based on international data (there have been too few COVID-19 cases in NZ to produce an IFR estimate). "
[01:31:41] <pompolic> rmmh: i think "the new normal" was a meme for a while on the tweeter
[01:31:48] <meowcat> it's not unreasonable to expect "flu shots" to be replaced in the market by something that's basically a rolling update for your immune system.
[01:31:51] <rmmh> new normal is mostly used by antivax crowd
[01:32:00] <pompolic> in reaction to that
[01:32:14] <ggreer> nobody knows how effective the nasal spray thing is
[01:32:16] <meowcat> i will gladly subscribe to yearly antivirus updates
[01:32:18] <rmmh> I feel like 1) it is impossible for us to eliminate covid globally 2) it is impossible to continually suppress covid without massive economic downsides 3) with vaccinations, risk is low enough that it's not worth the downsides 4) govts will slowly try to pivot to this "ok we're loosening up and encouraging vaccines" without overwhelming ERs
[01:32:33] <ggreer> meowcat: eh, the majority of sick days I've had in the past several years are due to covid vaccine, not actual illness
[01:32:38] <pompolic> that seems like a reasonable prediction to me

[01:34:53] <pompolic> i was confused about having an allergic reaction after a week, then i looked it up and apparently this is common
[01:35:19] <kuudes> if covid ifr is 150/100000 and influenza 39/100000, and vaccine reduces covid by factor of 1/24, that is then ~ 150/24 ~ 6/100000
[01:35:20] <rmmh> there's a HPV vaccine already
[01:35:28] <kuudes> I guess that is lower than influenza, but not by very much

[02:37:02] <gwern> ...reactionary guys is that you always seem so highly impressed with yourselves for possessing supposedly “dangerous thoughts,” as though the “dangerous thoughts” of @CryptoFrogPrince69 or whoever aren’t trivially accessible to everyone with an internet connection.

[02:50:35] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: because #top doesn't exist anymore, and #sidebar still does at a similar height
[02:50:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It does exist
[02:50:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: #top is an implicit anchor; all pages have it
[02:51:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Notice that the back to top link works fine, and it links to #top ...
[02:51:32] <gwern> it does? hm. but I think that would trigger the broken-anchor checker because it doesn't know about any implicit runtime dynamic anchors
[02:51:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fuck the checker
[02:51:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> If it can't comply with standards what use is it -_-
[02:52:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Linking to something like #sidebar could have god knows what weird consequences
[02:52:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> #top is guaranteed to be top of the page
[02:53:11] <gwern> I don't object to the correctness but the anchor checker script will need to be changed somehow to deal with #top not being defined in the generated html

[02:59:28] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: as far as that goes, I'm not sure it's unnecessary, but as I said, you are free to remove it and i'll see if it triggers any errors
[02:59:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Do you keep a list anywhere of "CSS features that will be implemented soon hopefully, let's keep an eye on vendor progress"?
[02:59:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> It just occurred to me that it would be useful to do that.
[02:59:52] <gwern> there are a few inside the CSS itself
[03:00:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I guess so, probably wouldn't hurt to centralize at some point

[03:01:01] <gwern> dns-prefetch I think I removed because something was going wrong with them. they weren't firing right or browsers were ignoring them or something
[03:01:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> They keep changing how that shit works ...
[03:07:10] <saturn2> why would you want dns-prefetch but not preconnect?

[03:43:18] <shawwwn> well. I asked for $200k/yr full time, they offered $190k/yr contract. But after taxes, $190k/yr contract = banking $5,126 per paycheck, $200k/yr full time = banking $6,051 per paycheck. So basically an entire laptop every 2 weeks.
[03:43:31] <shawwwn> Dunno. I'll have to think it over.
[03:44:23] <shawwwn> Oh, my mistake. $6,051 per paycheck is $190k/yr full time. My goal was $200k/yr, which would be $6,371 per paycheck.
[03:45:12] <shawwwn> basically, that translates into -$7,500 over 3 months from where I was aiming for.

[10:31:26] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: anyway, I'm assuming payment platforms would do something like forecast user spending per time unit and continuously shift enough local currency in to cover that, plus a buffer for unexpected load spikes
[10:31:46] <feep[work]> (with the loss overhead passed on as fees)
[10:32:38] <feep[work]> the inflation creates a source of inefficiency, but the advantage of very fast transactions would outweigh it for many usecases
[10:33:02] <feep[work]> and we could lower inflation over time if we're confident that doing so will not create a glut of investment
[10:33:30] <feep[work]> or, for instance, raise it if euro or dollar start inflating hardcore (unlikely)

[11:31:12] <feepbot> <gwern> 'New research from the American cybersecurity firm FireEye, working with the Israeli military, exposes the failed deception and describes the techniques the hackers used to in their effort to put the blame elsewhere...ut their ploy to point the finger at Iran failed. The hackers, whom FireEye refers to as UNC215, made several key technical mistakes that blew their cover and
[11:31:12] <feepbot> strongly linked them back to their previous work. For example, they used similar files, infrastructure, and tactics across multiple operations in the Middle East. “There are pieces that will distinguish the operator or their sponsor,” says John Hultquist, vice president of threat intelligence at FireEye. “They will bleed through multiple operations regardless of deception.”
[11:31:12] <feepbot> On top of multiple technical giveaways, another important clue is the kind of information or victims that the hackers targeted. UNC215 repeatedly attacks the same kinds of targets in the Middle East and Asia, all of them directly related to China’s political and financial interests. The group's targets overlap with those of other Chinese hacking groups, which do not always
[11:31:17] <feepbot> coincide with the interests of known Iranian hackers. “You can create significant deception, but ultimately you have to target what interests you,” Hultquist says. “That will provide information on who you are because of where your interests are.”' https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/10/1031622/chinese-hackers-false-flag-iran-israel-fireeye/

[13:47:12] <PapuaHardyNet> while it is generally beneficial to have transparency in money expenditure, especially when you are in a position where the benefits provided by the state are far greater than the benefits you get by having financial privacy, this doesn't apply to all states

[14:48:22] <Gurkenglas> I'd like to see, say, a diagram that you'd use in a presentation for middle managers, in order to make them able to pretend to other middle managers that they know logic. Words like theory and signature, and which words tend to go with which others.
[14:48:47] <feep[work]> ERDs belong on whiteboards, not in specs
[14:48:55] <feep[work]> writing it in a spec kills its soul
[14:49:21] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], I was figuratively nodding along with your penultimate line, but expand on the last one, please.
[14:49:51] <feep[work]> ERDs are a visual representation of the actual structure of a software system
[14:50:12] <Gurkenglas> And a spec should not constrain reality that hard?
[14:50:15] <feep[work]> the internal relation between modeled entities
[14:50:21] <feep[work]> a spec should constrain the *periphery* of the system.
[14:50:28] <Gurkenglas> Sold.
[14:50:32] <feep[work]> constraining the inside makes ERDs into an enemy of improvement.
[14:50:56] <feep[work]> in the same way that unit testing middle-level components does.
[14:51:20] <Gurkenglas> Because middle-level components ought to be able to change meaning in minor versions?
[14:51:39] <feep[work]> exactly, and because their behavior is not part of the business logic *or* the integration logic.
[14:52:12] <feep[work]> if their behavior is relevant, it should be because of business requirements, which should be tested as such.
[14:53:01] <Gurkenglas> I can buy that you'd test whether the middle-level component has changed behavior in order to compare to the coder's commit message on what behavior he intended to change
[14:53:48] <feep[work]> yeah but that usually has the character of the code smell where test code duplicates application code
[14:54:05] <feep[work]> if your app code has an if (foo) then bar()
[14:54:19] <feep[work]> then if you write a unittest that says foo = true; Class.expect!bar(); method();
[14:54:24] <feep[work]> all you've done is write the app twice
[14:54:40] <feep[work]> unittests should be structurally different from the code they test.
[14:54:44] <Gurkenglas> if foo and bar can only be used together they shouldnt be two functions
[14:54:52] <feep[work]> I mean, yes, it's an example :p
[14:55:06] <feep[work]> the point is, don't test the exact same thing you just wrote, that's just testing the compiler, it never helps
[14:55:15] <feep[work]> if you fucked up the app code, you'll fuck up the unittest code too and in the same way
[14:55:41] <Gurkenglas> i agree that test code duplicating application code is a smell, but if it's actually impossible to write another test then what you're smelling isn't the test
[14:55:56] <feep[work]> eh, or it means you're cutting your test code in a bad way.
[14:56:10] <feep[work]> I'm not saying this against tests, I'm saying it against specifically *unit* tests.
[14:56:53] <feep[work]> ie. the sort of test where you feed in two mockers and a stub database
[14:57:12] <feep[work]> because the thing you are testing *is not a unit*.
[14:57:13] <Gurkenglas> what im trying to get it is: the fact that this usually has this character is a joyuous occasian, it gives your lots of surface attack area of formulaic code base improvement
[14:57:31] <feep[work]> not sure I agree, but we're probably talking past each other.
[14:58:15] <Gurkenglas> It is good when the project head who cant actually code and follows his manual on how to do software engineering can be given this straightforward rule, right? :)
[14:58:23] <feep[work]> I mean
[14:58:30] <feep[work]> in that scenario ur fukt anyway, so I don't think about that
[14:58:33] <Gurkenglas> so he isnt stuck paying people for lines of code
[14:58:42] <feep[work]> there is no rule that project heads who can't code cannot fuck up
[14:59:22] <Gurkenglas> then lets call it a spectrum, and that introducing this rule saves more of the spectrum from doom
[15:01:00] <Gurkenglas> Also, this line of inquiry isn't completely frivolous: If we can get enough heuristics for how to do software engineering, we might be able to wire openai codex into something that is more likely than before this rule to blow up the light cone
[15:01:15] <Gurkenglas> um, less likely

[16:15:19] <RiversHaveWings> I have considered training a *different*, cheaper, noise removal model
[16:15:24] <RiversHaveWings> But haven't gone to the effort yet.
[16:15:43] <RiversHaveWings> Because I don't need *the diffusion model itself*, I just need to remove the noise so I can feed it to CLIP.
[16:15:50] <RiversHaveWings> In a differentiable way.
[16:18:28] <nshepperd2> hmm
[16:18:42] <RiversHaveWings> The diffusion model is a super chonk 500M param model

[16:56:20] <Gurkenglas> Should be brute-force answerable by bayes, right? C is the string random variable containing a code. I can read it but I don't know all its properties; if this is nonsensical, say so. M is whether C matches my spec. E is [0,1] random variable that's codex's estimate. P(M) would be a deterministic real number I don't know: The probability that a random code matches my spec. P(E|M) would be the one probability 
[16:56:20] <Gurkenglas> distribution, independent of the particular code, over estimates for random code that does match. P(M|E=x) is the portion of random codes with estimate x that match; P(M|E=x) happens to be equal to x for all x in [0,1]. Now multiple codes at a time, hmm..

[18:27:30] <dbohdan> Gurkenglas: Golfed!  (Though I find keeping the result file useful.)
[18:27:46] <RiversHaveWings> Seriously I think the main benefit to using JAX is that Google gives away free TPU compute.
[18:27:58] <Gurkenglas> dbohdan, keeping the diff is more efficient :3
[18:28:55] <nshepperd2> yep, that is certainly the most compelling reason to use it
[18:29:41] <RiversHaveWings> Does it reproduce the output of the PyTorch model to reasonable precision?

[18:30:41] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: oh, are you running the JAX version in fp16?
[18:30:57] <RiversHaveWings> I should try bf16 actually on Ampere to see if that still works
[18:31:08] <nshepperd2> the output is within 1e-6 relative error
[18:31:16] <RiversHaveWings> good :)
[18:31:31] <nshepperd2> i had a lot of unit tests to get there
[18:31:34] <RiversHaveWings> ahhh
[18:31:45] <nshepperd2> i'm doing fp32 right now
[18:31:53] <RiversHaveWings> yeah that's probably why it's slower
[18:32:11] <RiversHaveWings> The 256x256 is FP16 by default

[18:34:00] <dbohdan> Gurkenglas: It's fine when `./foo` outputs text.  However, it becomes uninformative for debugging when the input is binary.

[22:09:02] <pompolic> i played splitgate recently
[22:09:19] <pompolic> the players at low ranks haven't realized that you can just rewrite the map topology with portals
[22:09:31] <pompolic> (read: they don't seem to use them)
[22:10:02] <pompolic> fun part is that it's a double-edged sword, you can also be shot through your portals. you only have  the advantage of being able to see through them
[22:11:41] <kuudes> how does orientation behave in those games with portals? ie if you put portal so that your head ends up down, does your avatar also flip and drop on their head or something?
[22:12:09] <pompolic> hmm. usually portal-enabled walls are vertical
[22:12:23] <kuudes> ah, so you can't make portals in air?
[22:12:28] <pompolic> you're generally not allowed 6DoF in games because fun is not allowed
[22:13:15] <pompolic> some walls are at 30-40 degrees inclination, and you get readjusted upright as you step through
[22:13:25] <pompolic> hold on
[22:13:35] <pompolic> momentum is preserved, but i think you probably get interpolated upright
[22:13:59] <pompolic> and no, portals in air aren't allowed
[22:14:19] <pompolic> there are specific spots on the map where you can create them, just like in Portal

[22:16:07] <Gurkenglas> One of the things I thought I could do if I had more money is post, like, 100$ bounties for anyone to do some experiment or PR. Do you think codex will make this obsolete, because specifying the bounty condition is enough to make codex do it?

[22:17:20] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: it will absolutely make jobs harder for maintainers if any monetary incentive is provided
[22:17:59] <Gurkenglas> Part of the bounty goes to the maintainer, then.
[22:18:20] <gwern> Gurkenglas: one problem is with spammers. like someone was offering a t-shirt to anyone with a github commit, so boom, thousands of single-character typo fixes spammed
[22:19:01] <PapuaHardyNet> not totally unrelated, because codex wouldn't necessarily generate accurate code for less well known codebases and for tricky problems, and even if it does, the bugs will be subtle and very well hidden
[22:19:11] <Gurkenglas> gwern, I was thinking more like "100$ to anyone who implements this particular feature"

[22:20:59] <pompolic> and got pushy about it
[22:20:59] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, or perhaps: you pay 10$ to reserve the bounty, you get 110$ if your PR is merged as fixing the issue
[22:21:11] <pompolic> and this keeps happening during GSoC

[22:47:12] <PapuaHardyNet> are you sure you sent the right link? It is a familiar comment deriding XMPP, and there's nothing bad about matrix protocol in there
[22:48:39] <PapuaHardyNet> what I'm really waiting for is a compiled version of the matrix server. something better than synapse
[22:48:40] <dbohdan2> Yes, sorry I wasn't clear.  My point with that link is that XMPP has a lot of problems.
[22:49:22] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, I agree with you about XMPP. I do think, howevere, that matrix is fast becoming the replacement for IRC
[22:49:33] <mst> ggreer: gsoc isn't a 'reason' for any such change, normally the projects decide what they want doing and then recruit an intern
[22:49:42] <mst> ggreer: so that doesn't make any sense

[22:51:23] <dbohdan2> PapuaHardyNet: Is it?  I think few people are replacing their IRC usage with Matrix (except as an IRC proxy).  Going through my HN favorites, here is a "Synapse sucks" comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25100873

[23:20:50] <Gurkenglas> i wonder what happens when you finetune codex on (unit test, code that passes it) pairs (though beware the 2-4-6 problem) and then continue to finetune it through self play on unit tests generated by it
[23:21:59] <gwern> you'll get a boost from the implicit self-distillation, but that usually only works once or twice and then tops out
[23:22:57] <gwern> at least, just with generation. do you mean actually executing the code? I'm not sure how well that'd work. I'd expect most generated code to not work in isolation
[23:23:57] <Gurkenglas> yeah, executing the code. you generate unit tests, generate functions, test whether they pass the test, and then finetune it on generating those functions for that test (though of course the probability of the test is unmodified)
[23:24:01] <gwern> (self-contained small code snippets probably work great already. the edge cases are complex systems, where you need a full test environment for tests to pass at all)
[23:25:00] <Gurkenglas> im all in favor of a system that can only build nonspaghetti code
[23:26:48] <Gurkenglas> (generating the test isn't strictly necessary; you could just finetune it on half their benchmark, then validate with the other half)
[23:27:55] <Gurkenglas> if only humanity had used proof assistants more so we'd have data
[23:28:13] <RiversHaveWings> Um, how do you determine a consulting rate for a small thing if you have like... no previous consulting experience
[23:28:23] <RiversHaveWings> The articles on determining a consulting rate I am finding refer to a "previous salary" lol.
[23:28:40] <mst> so work out roughly what market rate salary would be for the thing
[23:28:44] <mst> then calculate from that
[23:29:04] <ggreer> patio11 has some writings about this
[23:29:10] <mst> also, if you don't feel uncomfortable asking for that much money, you probably didn't pick a high enough number
[23:29:11] <ggreer> basically ask for lots of money
[23:30:22] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: My bottom line on Matrix at the moment is that it's underperforming.  Before it launched, I expected better adoption and more implementations at this point.  Perhaps the lack of a good lightweight server betrays flaws in the spec that make it too difficult to get a server to production?  I have only skimmed the spec, so I am not ready to judge.  BTW, sorry, I shouldn't assume the worst when someone talks about "shilling Matrix" in the 
[23:30:22] <dbohdan> abstract.
[23:32:22] <Gurkenglas> codex paper:~"the usual benchmark for code generation is whether it's syntactically equal to the reference solution" *facepalm*
[23:32:34] <RiversHaveWings> Gurkenglas: wow
[23:32:52] <RiversHaveWings> Shouldn't they be using a thorough unit test suite?
[23:33:37] <Gurkenglas> Well, they are. They simply mention that that's not usual, first sentence of 2.1, and I felt like complaining.
[23:33:52] <RiversHaveWings> Oh.
[23:34:44] <Gurkenglas> And also, imo training it to train the exact text in the training set is as silly.

[23:36:05] <dbohdan> RiversHaveWings: I have seen (but haven't used) this type of advice for consultants: https://twitter.com/_sagesharp_/status/936399670535843840
[23:36:17] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: if you're consulting on DL, charge at least $50/hr
[23:36:18] <|dbotdan> Sage Sharp 🏳️‍🌈 (@_sagesharp_, 2017-12-01 01:00): ‘If you're considering how much you need to charge as a consultant, take all your expenses, multiply them by 1.35, and then calculate your hourly rate based on working four hours a day, four days a week.’
[23:36:48] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: It is DL, yes :)
[23:37:04] <Gurkenglas> You know what? Instead of python code, have it generate weights for a small neural network that implements a function that passes the test. Then you can train it directly to produce better weights, without running the unit test on each code sample.
[23:37:09] <RiversHaveWings> ty :)
[23:37:29] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: for comparison, shawwwn is aiming $200k annually (at a heavy workload and only 2 weeks off, that's $63/hr), and he's not even doing DL
[23:37:55] <kuudes> don't name the number first
[23:37:58] <gwern> Gurkenglas: that would be DRL because 'pass the test' is non-differentiable, and DRL doesn't work

[23:40:30] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: fwiw, if you did a big writeup about everything you know about style transfer and gan optimization, instead of settling for throwaway twitter screenshots, you'd be vastly better known and could charge much more

[23:41:56] <Gurkenglas> gwern, let me rephrase. Train a network to produce an R^n that minimizes a given (R^n -> R).
[23:41:57] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: the key is to be willing to walk
[23:42:22] <shawwwn> If you need the job, then you need the job. But that means you’ll have to take whatever they give
[23:42:25] <Gurkenglas> The given R^n -> R is differentiable. Im not quite certain what format it's given in, but "neural network" seems reasonable.
[23:42:53] <shawwwn> With Routable, I wanted $200k and they came back with $160k, so I’m probably either going to take the 3mo contract, or just say no
[23:43:21] <gwern> (there's always the TPU/Jax team...)
[23:43:26] <shawwwn> Point is, ask (from the beginning) for a lot. That way you have the option later of settling for less
[23:43:29] <mst> $100/hr is kind of a bare minimum
[23:43:45] <mst> for consultancy type stuff

[23:44:09] <mst> gwern: oh, yes, fair, this is more for RiversHaveWings' calibration
[23:44:20] <mst> gwern: because we need to convince -him- to be unafraid about charging more
[23:44:27] <shawwwn> Oh, it’s a consulting gig? Sorry, people were talking like it was a full time job
[23:44:36] * Gurkenglas supposes a better behaved R^n->R format would be "have a R^n->R^m network, minimize the output norm."
[23:44:43] <RiversHaveWings> It's a relatively small thing

[23:45:05] <mst> was where we started
[23:45:26] <mst> RiversHaveWings: right, which means you charge -more- per hour
[23:45:30] <shawwwn> Sorry, I only saw Gwern’s ping
[23:45:33] <mst> because your non-billable overhead is higher

[23:51:01] <ggreer> firing people can be hard. for candidates with a resume gap, they want to make sure you haven't lost your mojo
[23:51:14] <dbohdan> gwern: I guess so.  It is probably comparable to how many developers really learn proof assistants or SMT solvers.
[23:51:14] <shawwwn> I was mentally like dude, I have like 4 people DMing me on Twitter with ML jobs, I don’t need this
[23:51:18] <gwern> (see, that's why TPU/Jax would probably like you. they know what you spent that gap doing: beating the hell out of their systems)
[23:51:52] <ggreer> just tell them that. if your other offers are better, they'll either improve their offer or say "oh shit. good luck"
[23:52:16] <gwern> dbohdan: yep. SMT solvers are applicable in tons of places, especially in security. but it takes a new generation growing up 'speaking SMT' to understand what problems SMT solvers solve and how one would even translate one's practical problem into the tongue of 'lots of boolean clauses'
[23:52:53] <Gurkenglas> that they cant tell how good you are without hiring you indicates that they might be bad at telling how good you are after they hire you, to your detriment
[23:53:39] <Gurkenglas> of course it may just be that some of their interviewers are bad judges so they have to use rules like that, but then their insides are more redundant
[23:53:54] <Gurkenglas> i suggest that you talk to someone who actually works there
