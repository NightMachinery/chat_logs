[12:17:14] <fnutt> In short - instead of telling people it's all wrong how they do it, we need to be a little careful and instead offer help on how to resolve all the issues.
[12:18:00] <bookworm> I didn't say it's all wrong, I pointed out the places where it is
[12:18:12] <fnutt> Not saying anyone has not been helpful... but the pr author has gotten a discussion about the pr itself and if we want it. He has been given a lot to fix code wise.
[12:18:28] <bookworm> yes, because it needed fixing
[12:18:54] <bookworm> there's nothing personal about it, the code now is objectively better than the first iteration
[12:19:27] <bookworm> that's how code review should work, no?
[12:19:41] <fnutt> One person told me 3-4 years ago that they didn't fancy helping The Lounge project because it was too much hassle to even get a pr accepted. I can understand both sides, which is why I think we need to offer help when we can to not be considered difficult.
[12:20:10] <fnutt> Absolutly, and I agree about the high level of code quality we want in this project.
[12:20:26] <bookworm> just merging garbage that you then need to immediately clean up is not a good thing to do maintenance wise
[12:20:39] <fnutt> I agree
[12:20:46] <bookworm> and TL has issues as is, no need to add yet more things
[12:20:53] <fnutt> But there's a significant difference between us and e.g. KiwiIRC.
[12:22:14] <fnutt> Not saying we should lower our requirements for code quality.
[12:23:18] <bookworm> there are things that are just preference (red or green barn) those shouldn't be argued for. However whether you should put your kitchen tools into the barn or the kitchen?
[12:25:42] <bookworm> code should first and foremost be easy to read, if you need to look in detail at all callers of a function just to understand a conditional branch, something is clearly wrong
[12:26:53] <bookworm> especially as no one will ever dare to touch that conditional again as it's a lot of effort to do that
[12:30:17] <fnutt> Anyway, we do agree and I think you got point (since you asked). :)
[12:30:46] <fnutt> got my point*
[12:31:12] <fnutt> I hope the pr author is not burned out of all the things that has to be changed.

[12:33:32] <MaxLeiter> @fnur
[12:33:36] <MaxLeiter> whoops
[12:33:44] <bookworm> what I don't understand is why you'd be burned out when you get review comments that are valid? I personally appreciate it if people point me at where I messed up the code
[12:33:45] <MaxLeiter> fnutt: the changes are sensible 
[12:34:15] <bookworm> *everybody* messes up code
[12:35:02] <bookworm> you've been starring at the code for so long that it's easy to miss things or just to assume it's obvious as you've been reading the codepaths in question and have all pf it in RAM
[12:35:14] <bookworm> future you will look at it and go WTF
