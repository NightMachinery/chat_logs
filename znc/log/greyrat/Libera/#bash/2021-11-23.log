[00:17:06] <greycat> So you *do* want to feed these results to a program and take actions.  That means that a traditional implementation of ls cannot be used.
[00:17:29] <greycat> If you know that your script will only ever run on systems with relatively recent GNU coreutils, then you can use specific GNU extensions of ls to make this work.
[00:17:58] <greycat> Otherwise, you can use things like:
[00:18:00] <greycat> !rlart
[00:18:00] <greybot> Recursive version of ls -lart (requires GNU find and sort): find . -type f -printf '%T@/%TY-%Tm-%Td/%TX/%p\0' | sort -zn | while IFS=/ read -rd '' _ day time path; do printf '%s %s %s\n' "$day" "${time%.*}" "$path"; done
[00:18:27] <greycat> You don't necessarily need the recursive part of it, but the sorting with NUL-delimited timestamp+filename streams is the same principle.
[00:19:49] <greycat> Or you can use the real-world solution that most people end up using eventually: make sure the filenames have a big-endian timestamp in them.  Like yyyymmdd, NOT mm-dd-yyyy or anything else intended for humans.

[02:47:57] * earendel now wonders if the terminal prints the keypresses into a buffer (and on screen) before sending them to a shell. i guess that must be the case. unless the backend is not a shell, just the backend of the terminal. 
[02:49:19] <phogg> earendel: I take it you are not well versed in the way a tty works.
[02:49:29] <earendel> in which case there would in no case be such a thing than a remote shell (technically)
[02:49:53] <greycat> With interactive ssh, there is a (pseudo)terminal on the remote system as well as the local terminal.

[09:18:39] <tsujp> is there a way to make this command denser or is this pattern fine as is? `grep -x "$hosts_entry" /etc/hosts || echo "$hosts_entry" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null`
[09:19:02] <tsujp> in english "if this line doesn't exist in /etc/hosts, add it"
[09:19:08] <dyeplexer> well, for example using "Table\n=====\n" would yield different outputs when passed to echo and when passed to printf. In order to get the intended output in echo, I would have to pass the '-e' flag. Using the dollar-singlequote string would work in all cases.
[09:20:37] <e36freak> tsujp: i'd honestly probably use an if statement to make it clearer, and probably grep -Fqx, but it's fine
[09:20:55] <tsujp> isn't -F to indicate a plain string?
[09:21:35] <e36freak> is hosts_entry supposed to be treated as a regex?
[09:21:48] <larryv> dyeplexer: best practice is to not use echo
[09:21:50] <e36freak> do you want a "." in it to match any character, for example?
[09:22:03] <e36freak> also sure, use printf instead
[09:22:16] <dyeplexer> okay
[09:22:28] <tsujp> I do not want "." to match any char
[09:22:35] <tsujp> Oh right so passing -F will make it a plain string
[09:22:38] <e36freak> right, you want -F to treat it as a literal string
[09:22:56] <tsujp> I was conflating "$var" with grep for some reason, shell substitution occurs before grep even sees that string

[14:03:05] <ychaouche> hello bash gurus
[14:04:13] <ychaouche> I'd like to run a command on log files and their rotation (log, log.1, log.2.gz etc.), I thought I'd do something like this : echo /var/log/apache2/roundcube.error{$(seq -s, 2 14)}.gz, unfortunately, that simply prints /var/log/apache2/roundcube.error{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}.gz
[14:04:56] <ychaouche> the "{}" substitution(?) isn't being done
[14:05:33] <Soliton> {2..14}
[14:05:39] <Soliton> !seq
[14:05:39] <greybot> seq(1) is nonstandard, inefficient and useless. For bash2.04+/zsh/ksh93, use for ((i = 1; i <= 10; i++)); do ..., bash3.0+, use for i in {1..10}, for POSIX and other shells, see !counting
[14:05:58] <ychaouche> oh wait, yes you beat me to it Soliton
[14:06:30] <geirha> brace expansion happens before parameter expansion and command substitution, which is why {$(...)} won't work
[14:08:52] <ychaouche> geirha: thanks for this. I realize why order is important with a concrete example now.

[18:45:25] <earendel> it may be part of their business model.
[18:45:31] <Soliton> you want field splitting so you cannot work with leading traling whitespace.
[18:46:13] <Soliton> if this should work with any filename then you need a NUL between hash and filename as well.

[23:27:57] <lovetruth> Hello :)
[23:28:00] <llua> hi
[23:28:24] <lovetruth> Can I replace variables with their values inside a string in bash?... (Like, if bar=abc1234 'foo $bar' with 'foo abc1234')
[23:28:32] <lovetruth> It's like if I have foobar() { echo foo $bar; }      -> then "type foobar|sed '4q;d'         would give me the instruction without replacing $bar with it's value
[23:29:12] <llua> !want
[23:29:13] <greybot> And I want a pink unicorn lollipop magic wand!
[23:29:23] <llua> !xy

[23:30:18] <greycat> # bar=abc1234; foo="foo $bar"; declare -p foo
[23:30:19] <shbot> greycat: declare -- foo="foo abc1234"
[23:30:28] <greycat> is that what you wanted?  it's unclear.
[23:31:58] <llua> # foobar() { echo foo $bar; }; type foobar|sed '4q;d'
[23:31:59] <shbot> llua:     echo foo $bar
[23:32:05] <llua> he wants bar to expand there
[23:32:13] <lovetruth> llua, exactly
[23:33:03] <llua> which lends one to wonder what he is actually trying to do with that
[23:33:35] <lovetruth> It's an output from type foobar
