[03:26:24] <kenaryn> Please what is passthroughmode and its purpose? I'm always hindered with it when trying to copy/paste something.
[03:28:57] <emanuele6> > passthrough: Similar to insert mode, but passes through all keypresses except <Escape> to leave the mode. It might be useful to bind <Escape> to some other key in this mode if you want to be able to send an Escape key to the website as well. Note that single keys canâ€™t be bound in this mode.
[03:30:35] <emanuele6> like insert mode, but it has no default bindings except a binding to exit.
[03:30:38] <kenaryn> Thanks a lot, so it's insert mode without safeguard against accidental quits and single keypresses.
[03:30:47] <emanuele6> what? no
[03:30:53] <kenaryn> with*
[03:31:17] <emanuele6> it's like insert mode, but it's not
[03:31:33] <emanuele6> so it is not affected by input.insert_mode.* settings
[03:31:49] <emanuele6> and it does not have any default bindings except one to exit it.
[03:31:52] <kenaryn> I have to paste 2 times to pass through the passthrough mode
[03:31:56] <emanuele6> i use it a lot
[03:32:14] <kenaryn> is there a shortcut to activate it on purpose?
[03:32:18] <emanuele6> kenaryn: paste while you are in insert mode.
[03:32:41] <emanuele6> kenaryn: <c-v> is the binding to activate it.
[03:32:48] <emanuele6> and <shift-escape> to exit.
[03:33:29] <emanuele6> (you can also configure qutebrowser to automatically go to insert mode when you click on an input field.)
[03:33:48] <emanuele6> also i just checked and that is the default behaviour.
[03:33:48] <kenaryn> It is indedd the default.
[03:34:05] <emanuele6> then how do you have the copy paste problem?
[03:34:16] <kenaryn> insert mode is activated when cliking on a input field, and I did not alter that setting by my own.
[03:34:24] <emanuele6> are you trying to paste without selecting an input field?
[03:35:13] <kenaryn> I'm browsing with keyboard and instantly press <Esc>
[03:35:34] <kenaryn> I still don't understand its purpose.
[03:35:44] <emanuele6> purpose of what?
[03:36:20] <kenaryn> It always hinder my navigation, is there an use-case behind it?
[03:36:30] <emanuele6> what
[03:36:49] <kenaryn> behind the passthrough mode concept.
[03:37:00] <emanuele6> as i said, i use it all the time.
[03:37:22] <emanuele6> it lets you send keys to the page without triggering bindings.
[03:39:55] <kenaryn> ALlright, so it' intended to type some text without any shortcut possible as long as I don't leave it, is that correct?
[03:40:47] <kenaryn> I think you just said so but with a different vocabulary. Thanks.
[03:41:07] <emanuele6> normal GUI shortcuts work e.g. ctrl-v to paste
[03:41:15] <emanuele6> it's about qutebrowser bindings
[03:41:40] <emanuele6> and those also work, but there aren't any bound by default except <shift-escape> to exit by default
[03:42:17] <emanuele6> and passthrough mode is not affected by the input.insert_mode.* settings
[03:43:15] <emanuele6> i have some passthrough bindings personally: http://0x0.st/oZTi.txt
[03:44:41] <emanuele6> The-Compiler: is that description of passthrough mode in `:help bindings.commands' outdated? the binding to exit passthrough mode has been <shift-escape> for a very long time
[03:46:52] <kenaryn> Thanks mister.
[03:47:34] <kenaryn> what is mode=m?
[03:51:26] <emanuele6> it's python code
[03:51:58] <emanuele6> m is a variable, and mode is a named argument for the config.bind() function
[03:52:11] <emanuele6> that is the function you use to make a binding

[08:44:24] <toofar> is that "button 6" and "button 7"? If so no. No mouse bindings. Maybe some key binding tool outside of qutebrowser

[21:54:46] <tom_i> I realize that YouTube shows me some weird message that I'm using not secure browser
[21:55:09] <tom_i> so maybe because of that old Chromium version?
[21:55:51] <tom_i> btw. I'm using source release 2.4.0
[21:59:23] <The-Compiler> tom_i: because you're using an old Qt 5.12

[22:07:42] <The-Compiler> tom_i: that's in general how stable distributions like Linux Mint (or Ubuntu/Debian Stable it's based on) work: New releases all 2 years (in case of Ubuntu LTS and Linux Mint), and then you keep the same old software with a couple of small exceptions
[22:08:44] <The-Compiler> tom_i: so until a new Linux Mint comes out in June, you'll be using a Qt/Chromium from 2018
[22:09:57] <The-Compiler> tom_i: you can install via binaries from PyPI (the Python package index) to get a newer Qt, with some caveats like not having propietary codecs, see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/install.asciidoc#tox
[22:10:28] <The-Compiler> Earnest: out of curiosity, why the jitless flag?
[22:10:44] <Earnest> The-Compiler: To disable jit (W^X)
[22:12:03] <Earnest> Web is only place that can run arbitrary native code from across the internet without any control over it, so at least disable JIT so it doesn't get to work with native instructions and can be retained in the VM + sandbox more effectively
[22:13:51] <The-Compiler> emanuele6: good catch re bindings.commands, fixed in https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/4a7e87e645e62c18230a51fbfd97fba527c13339
[22:14:02] <Earnest> There's been enough CVEs against JIT'd js from chromium
