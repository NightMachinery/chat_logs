[23:31:13] <artchad> hi dto.
[23:31:18] <artchad> or dto's cat.
[23:31:23] <artchad> not sure who's there
[23:31:46] <dto> hehe
[23:31:53] <dto> how are you artchad 
[23:32:14] <artchad> I'm great as always. I'm always trying to be happy with the things I have.
[23:32:32] <artchad> I can learn Common Lisp and program games. I have things to eat and drink. Life is good
[23:32:45] <artchad> dto, how about you?
[23:32:56] <dto> yes!
[23:33:03] <dto> hows it going with Common Lisp? 
[23:33:06] <dto> i'm good thanks for asking!
[23:33:19] <dto> i'm also thankful. my mom is coming home from the hospital today. she'd been in for almost a week with covid
[23:33:36] <artchad> I'm right now reading through the first chapter of phoe's update to "Common Lisp Recipes".
[23:33:41] <dto> oh nice.
[23:33:54] <artchad> I'm also learning cl-opengl and sdl2
[23:34:14] <artchad> I'm following those: https://3bb.cc/tutorials/cl-opengl/
[23:34:37] <artchad> Once I'm comfortable with the opengl from those examples. I want to make the code work in sdl2
[23:34:48] <artchad> at that point I should be able to make basic games.
[23:35:00] <dto> hey cool! yeah i used bart's tutorials way back 
[23:35:01] <artchad> Then I can port DMOMD to SDL2, so it would work on Alpine and OpenBSD.
[23:35:07] <dto> what's DMOMD
[23:35:17] <artchad> I used to be "decent-username"
[23:35:24] <artchad> https://libregamewiki.org/dmomd
[23:35:37] <dto> oh cool!
[23:35:48] <dto> love roguelikes
[23:36:01] <artchad> You haven't played that yet?
[23:36:04] <artchad> I bet you have.
[23:36:06] <artchad> maybe not.
[23:36:08] <dto> nope.
[23:36:09] <artchad> xD
[23:36:36] <artchad> next time I will not track the binaries via Git. That was dumb.
[23:36:57] <artchad> I didn't know git hosting services had features like "releases"
[23:37:01] <artchad> I'll be using that from now on.
[23:37:16] <dto> :)
