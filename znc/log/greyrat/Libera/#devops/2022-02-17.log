[14:31:13] <merpaderp> I legit wonder why is vagrant not using same yaml config as ansible does
[14:31:27] <merpaderp> instead some bastardized whatever it uses
[14:31:41] <merpaderp> like, config.vm.define "web" do 
[14:31:46] <merpaderp> like, config.vm.define "web" do |web|
[14:31:53] <merpaderp> what does 'do |web|' even mean?
[14:31:58] <merpaderp> what kind of syntax is that
[14:36:12] <shad> merpaderp: first, ansible is done by RedHat, Vagrant is done by Hashicorp
[14:36:24] <shad> Second, Vagrantfile is written in ruby. The syntax is hardcore, agreed
[14:42:15] <merpaderp> so what in hashicorp they never heard of yaml
[14:44:40] <merpaderp> okay, so its one of those infra as code things
[14:44:53] <merpaderp> heard that one before and thought wtf does that even means, now I see
[14:49:46] <merpaderp> so vagrant is basically a very fancy and customiz-able wrapper around various VM systems

[15:30:13] <merpaderp> trying to deploy 3 VMs with vagrant, so that it kicks off ansible with a playbook to provision postgresql in replication mode
[15:32:09] <merpaderp> its my biggest gripe with all these automation tools, they are cool as hell, but each inventing their own scripting language, so annoying
[15:32:09] *** Joins: nsosa (~nsosa@atenea.uces.edu.ar)

[16:00:01] <shad> merpaderp: you still around ? I have something for Vagrant + Ansible if you need
[16:01:59] <shad> https://paste.mozilla.org/dpdzJaME 
[16:02:15] <shad> this should allow you to run ansible against your vagrant machine
[16:03:31] *** Joins: dme86 (~dan@user/dan86)
[16:13:35] <merpaderp> that should work if there is single machine, but I have many
[16:14:04] <merpaderp> well its not that bad, only problem so far is that libvirt spins up own dnsmasq to run dhcpd to give out IPs to VMS, that's standard, so hostnames of those VMs can be resolved at that dnsmasq
[16:14:23] <merpaderp> but my laptop where that all runs doesnt know about that dnsmasq running on virtual interface libvirt created, so it cant resolve those
[16:15:07] <merpaderp> that's why this needs own .dev tld so that those hostnames can be redirected back to correct dnsmasq at the caching dns server of my network
[16:15:30] <merpaderp> damn there are like 5 dnsmasq's running on laptop
[16:15:50] <merpaderp> no, just 3
[16:16:18] <merpaderp> one for LXC, that I used to have before, and two for vagrant for some reason
[16:17:50] <shad> merpaderp: you can still use this and ammend the inventory.yml file to target the VMs on your network
[16:18:02] <shad> just add one line per host in the inventory file
[16:18:11] <merpaderp> just put t3 values in inventory file?
[16:18:29] <merpaderp> riiight, thas 127 IP in that inventory file confused me, so I skipped thinking about it :D
[16:19:10] <merpaderp> default is the hostname?
[16:19:47] <shad> merpaderp: https://paste.mozilla.org/ZQXYfYuo inventory could look like that
[16:20:25] <shad> The first token in the line is just the name you want ansible to show you for given host. I think you can use it to filter if said step should be applied to it or not
[16:20:50] <shad> if you run ansible agains that inventory file, the playbook will be ran against the 3 hosts
[16:21:14] <merpaderp> wel that wont work either, there are 3 ssh keys each for each VM
[16:21:25] <shad> you can specify the ssh key in the inventory file too
[16:21:52] <shad> lemme find it
[16:22:28] <shad> you add for each host `ansible_ssh_private_keyfile=...` 
[16:22:37] <merpaderp> okay
[16:26:06] <merpaderp> I just foudn out that file is created automagically by vagrant
[16:26:23] <shad> the ssh key ? yes, in the dir I mentionned in the first paste i sent
[16:26:24] <merpaderp> the trick is to run ansible from vagrant file
[16:26:40] <merpaderp> it still shit the bed
[16:26:47] <shad> Running ansible from the Vagrantfile didn't work for me last time i did it
[16:26:48] <merpaderp> because I forgot to add hostnames to ansible host file
[16:26:58] <shad> iirc some fuckery with python2 instead of python3

[16:28:25] <shad> if that's what you are after... don't :D
[16:29:59] <shad> it's easier to use vagrant to create the VM's, then apply your ansible from your host to the vm in a second step
[16:34:11] <merpaderp> my laptop and target VMs are on debian bullseye, so should skip isssues with weird pythons all over the palces
[16:34:45] <merpaderp> okay, now it crapped out that ansible cant ssh into host, because, well it cant resolve a host with name 'master'
[16:34:57] <merpaderp> because that's registered in that weird dnsmasq for libvirt network, not my laptops network
[16:35:34] <merpaderp> I guess I should fix libvirt network to use just single dnsmasq, maybe, idk
[16:39:36] <merpaderp> 3 more failures, because of ansible mistakes
