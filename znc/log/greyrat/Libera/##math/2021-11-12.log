[00:04:46] <Z-module> ysftaha: He was showing that the set E = "the equality relation on X" is a subset of your general reflexive relation R, by starting with an arbitrary element of E. But E is {all (x,x) : x in X}.  So he could have said "take (x,x) in this equality relation". Instead he picked (x,y) in X × X "such that x = y". THose mean exactly the same thing.

[00:45:39] <biberao> ah
[00:46:04] <biberao> what do you guys call
[00:46:06] <biberao> lets say
[00:46:10] <biberao> f: A -> B
[00:46:13] <Z-module> the "image of f" is a set, namely the entire set {f(x) : x in the domain of f}.  THis is some subset of the originally given codomain of f, which very often is not even mentioned and just assumed to be R.
[00:46:15] <biberao> whats A and whats B ?
[00:46:46] <Z-module> any two sets, as long as B is not empty if A is nonempty
[00:46:48] <buster> domain and codomain.
[00:46:58] <biberao> thats the thing
[00:47:08] <biberao> we dont call it like that
[00:47:19] <biberao> A is the domain
[00:47:25] <biberao> but B is the arriving set
[00:47:30] <buster> the trick is that not every point in the codomain is the image of a point in the domain.
[00:47:32] <Z-module> that's what "codomain" means
[00:47:45] <biberao> but contradominio can be different frm the codomain
[00:47:47] <biberao> atleast here
[00:47:52] <Z-module> well every point *could* be, but it's not required
[00:47:59] <Z-module> it is iff f is a surjective function
[00:48:04] <biberao> yes
[00:48:09] <buster> yes. not necessarily, i should have said.
[00:48:20] <biberao> if f is a surjective function the Contradominio is equal to B
[00:48:32] <Z-module> yes, the image = the codomain

[00:58:14] <biberao> thats the thing

[03:17:49] <fltrz> it seems most related google searches indicate people used to have the opposite problem: getting them in conventional reverse order, and having to convert the symbolic expressions to power series to get them in increasing order. now it seems it default emits them in increasing order, so it feels like a regression, while it seems like it was a slight hassle to get them in increasing order, now that they made
[03:17:56] <fltrz> that default its an even bigger hassle to get them in conventional reverse order... unless I'm doin something majestically wrong

[05:55:48] <laurus> isekaijin: How do you know that it has to have only finitely many non-zero entries?
[05:57:25] <isekaijin> To be more precise, the direct sum V is characterized by a universal property. If you have a vector space W and a family of maps f_i : V_i -> W, then there exists a unique map f : V -> W such that f_i = f . g_i, where g_i : V_i -> V are the canonical injections.
[05:57:38] <isekaijin> And it turns out that the construction I gave before satisfies this universal property.

[05:59:30] <PlanckWalk> It's just that you can express the operation of a Turing machine in terms of recursion.
[05:59:57] <isekaijin> laurus: What needs proof is the fact that the explicit construction I gave first satisfies the universal property that I gave later.
[06:00:18] <isekaijin> Are you familiar with the fact that any vector space (even if it is infinite-dimensional) has a basis?

[06:04:29] <isekaijin> laurus: It applies in any context where you can “do linear algebra”. Vector spaces are one such context.
[06:04:42] <laurus> isekaijin: Interesting, okay
[06:04:49] <isekaijin> laurus: Modules over a ring are a more general such context.

[06:05:47] <isekaijin> Abelian groups are a special case of modules over a ring. Namely, Abelian groups are modules over Z.

[09:18:49] <ircuser8> Galois: different markets
[09:18:54] <ircuser8> completely
[09:19:10] <Galois> if they're different then why do you care about the other market?
[09:20:02] <Galois> I'm not in the dairy market. My career doesn't depend on it. I don't really care about the dairy market except when I go to buy milk.
[09:20:12] <frelleck> what country are you in, ircuser8?
[09:20:15] <ircuser8> Galois: it's like comparing tap water or at most, bottled water (*Terence* Tao excuse me), to Coke
[09:20:34] <Galois> ok, but those aren't different markets
[09:20:41] <Galois> coke and bottled water are partial substitutes
[09:20:43] <ircuser8> you think bottled water companies have the same resources or IP as Coca Cola lol?
[09:20:44] <Galois> (do you know basic econ?)
[09:21:07] <qergle> we have circa 8 billion parasites currently roaming the planet, of which 8 million are in the top 0.1 percentile (or about IQ 147+)
[09:21:08] <Galois> a better example would be bitcoin and ircuser8cryptocoin
[09:21:38] <frelleck> maybe you should switch areas of expertise ircuser8
[09:21:43] <qergle> i didn't know i shared this distinction with so many others
[09:21:43] <frelleck> math is just not very lucrative

[09:23:36] <dude12312414> anyway what gets mathematicians paid the most? I'm guessing it's mostly in some applied areas like finance, statistics, or maybe cryptography
[09:23:55] <frelleck> if you can code computers, you can 'do math' at a financial services company and make good money
[09:23:56] <[itchyjunk]> AI
[09:24:06] <qergle> bean counters make good money too
[09:24:08] <frelleck> or just use the words "data science"
[09:24:10] <ircuser8> I mean its just disappointing all im asking for is proportionality like

[09:25:25] <[itchyjunk]> your struggle with this speaks volumes
[09:25:51] <ircuser8> so you think if a maths phd gets paid $30/year for teaching others about Galois theory and a marketing intern gets paid $70k/year for teaching about SWAT analysis then theyre both being paid 'what their worth'?
[09:25:54] <ircuser8> ok
[09:25:58] <qergle> i'm glad i don't care too much about money...
[09:26:05] <frelleck> hah like adjuncts are allowed to teach Galois theory
[09:26:16] <frelleck> whatever your guess is, the reality is far grimmer
[09:26:21] <frelleck> but I digress
[09:26:30] <Galois> it's difficult to tell whether you're whining because you actually have a problem or because you just like whining
[09:26:32] <[itchyjunk]> you're not a math phd
[09:26:41] <[itchyjunk]> why do you care what math phd gets paid?
[09:27:02] <ircuser8> [itchyjunk]: oh I'm well past the PhD stage
[09:27:19] <ircuser8> but I still think its relevant to my argument
[09:27:34] <ircuser8> things haven't changed in 30+ years

[09:29:28] <frelleck> dude you should be thinking about retirement not your salary
[09:29:32] <frelleck> that shit is over
[09:30:12] <ircuser8> frelleck: you don't think 60 years have anything to contribute to society?
[09:30:14] <frelleck> because your competition for math jobs will be vastly younger and more willing to get paid peanuts
[09:30:29] <frelleck> no
[09:30:32] <frelleck> I'm not saying that
[09:30:55] <Galois> nobody likes a whiner. Being liked is an objectively valuable job attribute.
[09:31:10] <frelleck> I'm saying that as a 60 yr old you probably don't want a beginner type job
[09:31:22] <frelleck> which will be low-paying
[09:31:44] <[itchyjunk]> he wants $2 on math irc to answer some algebra questions
[09:32:02] <ircuser8> frelleck: yea because ive lost a lot of brain cells right? I can't possibly compete with a 20 something year old
[09:32:02] <Galois> and he says he's not in the same market
[09:32:23] <qergle> yeah, if you're 60 that ship has sailed. try again in the next life, assuming you don't come back as a beetle or something.
[09:32:25] <frelleck> you can compete, but the 20 yr old is looking for extra money to buy concert tickets
[09:32:27] <ircuser8> that line of thinking is the problem
[09:32:36] <frelleck> his needs are far less than yours
[09:32:40] <[itchyjunk]> based on the amount of actual math you've talked about, you can't compete even with me
[09:32:46] <[itchyjunk]> and i've here to get help, not help others
[09:34:09] <qergle> i mean we've gotten to the point that because of medical advances, technology, nutrition, etc, 60 years olds don't need to be on rocking chairs drooling, they can be productive members of the work force. but they're not going to be driving innovation, and they surely can't compete in terms of value/salary with 20-somethings.
[09:34:54] <frelleck> if you're 60 it's natural to want a job giving you a lot of respect and money, but it won't be gotten through helping people do math online, which a college kid in Tuscaloosa would do in his spare time for very little
[09:35:00] <ircuser8> qergle: OK now you've hit under the belt and have ticked me off
[09:35:23] <qergle> which part was under the belt?
[09:35:39] <ircuser8> '60 year olds can't drive innovation'
[09:35:49] <ircuser8> or 'compete in terms of value and salary'
[09:35:56] <qergle> yeah, most inventions and innovations aren't coming from 60 years olds, right?
[09:36:00] <qergle> empirics are on my side
[09:36:11] <frelleck> well the boss drives innovation to some extent
[09:36:12] <ircuser8> times have changed ...
[09:36:28] <frelleck> but ircuser8 is not talking "group leader" jobs
[09:36:34] <qergle> musk, jobs, bezos, how old are they?
[09:36:48] <frelleck> bezos is well into his 50s
[09:37:13] <dude12312414> well it's not theoretically impossible that some 60 year olds can compete with 20 year olds and provide value. it should be possible for them to demonstrate it somehow, though
[09:37:18] <qergle> yeah, and he's on the downside of his curve
[09:37:21] <frelleck> musk is late 40's, and jobs is dead
[09:37:41] <jmorris> frelleck: yeah but they all started 20 years ago lmao
[09:37:45] <qergle> bezos isn't creating amazon right now, he's just trying to catch up, unsuccessfully, to musk
[09:37:53] <frelleck> ircuser8 a 60 yr old provides value, but you're trying to provide value of a kind a 25 yr old normally provides
[09:38:19] <jmorris> also id be surprised if a 60 year old was good at problem solving
[09:38:24] <qergle> nobody is saying 60 year olds don't provide value. but i don't think it's controversial to say that most innovation isn't happening among sextagenarians.
[09:38:27] <frelleck> some of them are actually jmorris
[09:38:35] <jmorris> your brain has been degenerating for decades at that point
[09:38:49] <frelleck> ircuser8 wasn't talking about providing innovation in the elite sense qergle
[09:39:37] <qergle> i thought this whole conversation was about the very very pinnacle of the human condition.
[09:40:18] <frelleck> I thought he was just trying to get paid to be a smart person online
[09:40:23] <qergle> there are very intelligent people in all age categories, geniuses in all. but i also think that most innovation happens earlier in a person's life, not later.

[09:47:47] <greenbagels> mycroftiv: here's my innovative theory: hausdorff spaces are a liberal elite conspiracy theory
[09:48:03] <Galois> but you know, it's true that we don't always pay people by what they're worth. We pay 80- and 90- year olds social security, essentially universal basic income made politically palatable by inventing some sort of fiction that they "contributed" into the system with working-age tax payments
[09:48:33] <qergle> social security is a pittance
[09:48:36] <qergle> nobody lives on that
[09:48:52] <frelleck> they do believe it or not, sort of
[09:48:53] <Galois> still, we pay it. And I believe some people do live on that.

[09:49:05] <Galois> (some people live on less than $1 per day)
[09:49:27] <frelleck> the alternative is let 85 yr olds starve
[09:50:08] <Galois> the contribution system is really a fiction. Aside from being (non-strictly) monotonic, there's no linear or even sensible relationship between what you contributed in and what you get paid out.
[09:50:39] <qergle> that's how it was designed, it was always pay-as-you-go in the u.s.

[09:53:32] <Galois> anyway it's that 80-year olds generally can't compete in the job market. But what happens when robots outcompete 20-year olds?
[09:53:46] <Galois> .... not just america?
[09:53:49] <qergle> and that's probably going to get worse. SS is getting a small bump, but won't cover teh biden inflation
[09:54:08] <Galois> CAD/USD is flat out constant. So if USD is inflating then CAD is too.
[09:55:35] <qergle> google says canadia is forecast to inflate 4.9% this quarter
[09:55:59] <Galois> close enough, it's a forecast anyway
[09:56:11] <qergle> u.s. just published their october inflation rate: annualized to 6.2%, highest since the 90s, i thinj.
[09:56:12] <frelleck> if inflation stays high, the national debt's interest will increase accordingly, and the US national debt model will do us in
[09:56:27] <frelleck> so the government will do anything it can to prevent this
[09:57:10] <qergle> the government can't do much if it's a supply issue

[10:08:43] <Galois> my next door neighbor is from lebanon. he has a very different perspective on standards of living and needs vs wants
[10:09:11] <qergle> maybe he's comparing things to being in war-torn beirut
[10:09:35] <Galois> not even war right now, but the power has been out for weeks because of lack of fossil fuels to power the power plants and generators
[10:09:58] <Galois> the port explosion wasn't war either, it was just gross mismanagement
[10:10:11] <qergle> that's a different comparison though

[10:11:06] <Galois> well, some amount of travel is kind of enjoyable for me, so I'm starting from zero there and it can only go up
[10:11:19] <ircuser28> honestly jokes aside, its just disappointing that im not top dog anymore and every year I grow more retarded

[10:14:39] <Galois> yes, airplanes are out of consideration for now and indefinitely, but at least the land border is open?

[10:16:52] <Galois> it's not even necessarily directly because of covid, but planes have been trending towards unpleasantness for a long time
[10:16:59] <Galois> TSA isn't getting any better either
[10:17:00] <qergle> gas is a driver price. charging stations will be similarly pricier. unless you have a big solar panel on your car roof.
[10:17:26] <Galois> if you charge overnight you can charge from like an extension cord to your hotel room
[10:17:45] <qergle> those 110v personal chargers take forever
[10:17:53] <Galois> overnight is a long time
[10:18:06] <qergle> and you gotta make sure nobody sees your cord
[10:18:28] <Galois> I mean if you want to do it legit you can filter on tripadvisor by free charging (some hotels have actual free 240V charging)
[10:18:50] <Galois> the point is, charging cost doesn't have any noticeable effect on the overall trip

[10:30:52] <Galois> facebook millionaires don't really suffer from pump prices
[10:31:35] <Galois> also california has this absurdly mismanaged electricity grid that *causes fires* that burn down entire towns
[10:31:53] <Galois> leading to $50 billion liability claims and bankruptcy, and of course higher prices to pay for it
[10:32:47] <Galois> so I mean, everyone is paying one way or another, the game is and always has been to make your income outrun your expenses. Californians by and large voted for higher gas prices.

[10:35:00] <Galois> (avoiding) gas isn't actually even a primary reason to get a Tesla. It's just so much better to drive. Instant torque makes driving other cars feel like driving with lag. We don't tolerate lag in first person shooter games. Why do we tolerate it in real world cars that can have deadly consequences?

[10:36:24] <qergle> isn't that a complaint people have, that it doesn't feel right, you don't get that revving up feel.
[10:36:46] <Galois> it's the most idiotic complaint ever. It's like complaining that your water isn't brown and dirty.

[10:37:28] <Galois> the 1% of people who want loud engines and fumes are the 20th century equivalent of horse riding aficionados
[10:37:44] <Galois> yes, horse riding lovers exist. And there is a market for that. But it's a small one.

[16:27:43] <lpapp> one off error, then, thanks!
[16:29:16] <lpapp> W: is the expected not 12 instead of 11 in your test case?
[16:30:30] <W> yes, sorry
[16:30:37] <lpapp> so, there is another bug somewhere
[16:30:41] *** Quits: unmanbearpig (~unmanbear@user/unmanbearpig) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[16:30:45] <W> I didn't actually make a program to do it right or anything, just manually counted, and I counted wrong
[16:30:47] <lpapp> but I can probably fix that, hopefully, fingers crossed.
[16:30:55] <lpapp> I needed a test case to provide the code wrong.
[16:30:57] <W> yeah, you can't advance back more than one
[16:31:15] <lpapp> why not?
[16:31:17] <W> (or until it's not matching front any more, at least
[16:31:49] <W> because a new unique slice might start right after the duplicated entry
[16:31:53] <lpapp> This gives 11: if (A[back] == A[front]) { back = front - 1; if (A[front] != A[back]) ++distinct_slices; }
[16:32:02] <riv> can you generate test cases with known answers? i would maybe try that if i could not find the error
[16:32:25] *** Joins: unmanbearpig (~unmanbear@user/unmanbearpig)
[16:32:33] <W> you can just write a brute force one for small examples and compare - e.g. iterate over all subsequences
[16:32:37] <riv> or write a slower version which is more obviously correct, no optimizations, to compare against
[16:32:45] <lpapp> W: I count everything until the duplicate with the other else ifs
[16:33:01] <W> lpapp, no, not if there are bigger slices that continue
[16:33:02] <lpapp> W: that is why I thought back can be advanced more than one, since all those jumped over were counted before.
[16:33:06] *** Joins: Koen_ (~Koen@58.167.9.109.rev.sfr.net)
[16:33:31] <W> lpapp, e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,1,6,7,8 - once you reach 1, everything after the first 1 is still a part of a unique slice until the end of the array
[16:33:42] <lpapp> true
[16:33:46] <W> you've only counted the ones that include the second 1, not beyond
[16:33:49] <lpapp> so, my algo is not great.
[16:33:54] <lpapp> maybe a throwaway and find a better.
[16:34:36] <W> nah the framework is fine (and seems to be hinted at by the name of the task)
[16:34:37] <riv> to solve this problem I would consider breaking the array up based on when the same thing occurs twice in a row
[16:34:47] <riv> (may end up not being needed)
[16:35:22] <W> I'd just advance front and back by 1 when a duplicate is found
[16:35:30] *** Quits: Koen (~Koen@58.167.9.109.rev.sfr.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[16:35:36] <riv> in the example the CountDistinctSlices(A) = CountDistinctSlices(A[0..2]) + CountDistinctSlices(A[3..4])
[16:35:58] <riv> yes good idea use array indices rather than copy the array

[16:36:30] <riv> this approach doesn't help at all if the duplicates are apart from each other though
[16:36:53] <lpapp> W: I will think about it after work, but I think then the counter increase would also need to be reconsidered.
[16:37:14] <lpapp> that is why I am saying my algo is probably bin
[16:37:24] <lpapp> the current advancement is tight to how I update the counter
[16:37:27] <riv> I would probably build a secondary array B that returns the index of the next occurence of the element, i.e A[B[i]] = A[i] (or -1 if it never occurs again)
[16:37:44] <lpapp> riv: I am trying to solve this with O(1) space complexity if possible.
[16:37:52] <riv> do you mean O(N)?
[16:37:56] <riv> oh sorry space, not time
[16:37:58] <riv> I see
[16:38:01] <lpapp> I was hoping that the caterpillar method would help me with that.
[16:38:04] <W> "constant additional space" as they call it
[16:38:10] <lpapp> yes, runtime is O(n) for sure
[16:38:13] <riv> caterpillar method is new to me
[16:38:29] <riv> I should do this codility stuff, it seems like it could teach me a lot
[16:38:39] <riv> is it free to sign up
[16:39:26] <lpapp> W: is this also a bad idea then? else if (A[front] == A[front + 1]) { distinct_slices += (front - back); back = front; }
[16:39:32] <riv> https://codility.com/media/train/13-CaterpillarMethod.pdf ah so it is like O(n^2) search through the array, but it includes shortcutting to speed it up
[16:39:35] <lpapp> here, I am also advancing more than just one step at a time
[16:39:54] <riv> O(n^2) is acceptable to aim for right?
[16:40:06] <lpapp> O(n^2) is slow on large datasets
[16:40:09] <riv> ok
[16:40:12] *** Quits: drogas (~drogas@jump2.jet.uk) (Quit: Connection closed)
[16:40:41] <riv> i suppose you do not need to actually iterate all O(n^2) options, you know they are all valid when your caterpillar contains distinct values
[16:40:44] <tolarz> it's misleading to say this, lpapp
[16:40:45] *** Joins: drogas (~drogas@jump2.jet.uk)
[16:40:49] <lpapp> I think most of the assignments are about to avoid O(n^2) or sometimes worse.
[16:41:06] <tolarz> in practice, there's much more to efficiency than mere time complexity
[16:41:09] <lpapp> I think that is the idea, yes, riv.
[16:41:12] <riv> how many distinct slices are there in an array of length N with all different values? e.g. [1,2,3,4,5] for N=5
[16:41:28] <lpapp> caterpillar seems like a cool idea to me to reduce both the runtime and space complexity
[16:41:28] <tolarz> so the O(n^2) time algorithm might be more efficient than a O(n) time algorithm with a horrific cache access pattern
[16:41:37] <riv> I suppose there are N C 2 of them = n(n-1)/2?
[16:41:49] <riv> because you are picking every possible start and end array index

[18:15:12] <[itchyjunk]> And i mention the distributive law,associativity of * ?

[18:15:25] <[itchyjunk]> oops Abelian group right
[18:15:43] <isekaijin> It boils down to three requirements.
[18:15:49] <isekaijin> The first one I said above.
[18:16:03] <isekaijin> The second one is that (R,*) is a monoid. (Commutative monoid if you want the ring to be commutative.)

[18:16:36] <[itchyjunk]> wgat dies monoid mean?
[18:16:40] <[itchyjunk]> damnit
[18:16:41] <isekaijin> The third one is that, if you fix one of the arguments of * (remember that * is a binary operation), then you get an endomorphism of the Abelian group (R,+).
[18:16:43] <[itchyjunk]> What does monoid mean?
[18:17:03] <isekaijin> A set with an associative binary operation that has an identity element.
[18:17:39] <isekaijin> For example, the set of strings with concatenation as the binary operation.
[18:18:09] <[itchyjunk]> oh okay, i don't require the 1 too much either. i just need to be able to define noetherian rings after and noetherian rings seem to work will all the def's of ring
[18:18:14] <[itchyjunk]> non commutative, rng things
[18:18:35] <riv> I would just define a ring using a list of axioms
[18:18:40] <isekaijin> If you want rngs (r*i*ngs without *i*dentity), then you just need (R,*) to be a semigroup.
[18:18:49] <riv> it is not short but it is honest
[18:19:03] <isekaijin> I just say “a monoid in Ab” or “a semigroup in Ab”. All the hassle is shuffled to the reader of the definition.
[18:19:06] <[itchyjunk]> hmm the list of axiom way of defining on wikipedia seemed longer hence was trying to compress it :P

[21:08:26] <Simplar> If q = 1, I understand P(A) = 1/(2p).

[21:09:14] <Simplar> What if q = 2?
[21:09:45] <Simplar> The outcomes matching our needs ... change.
[21:09:54] <Decker> 1/(2^q)
[21:10:03] <Simplar> Decker: why?
[21:10:10] <Decker> every flip has the same odds

[21:13:32] <Simplar> According to your formula, P(A) = 1/(2^q)

[21:13:47] <Simplar> oh wait
[21:13:58] <Simplar> 1 = 1 throw
[21:14:06] <Simplar> so if 2 flips
[21:14:12] <Simplar> then P(A) = 2/(2^q)

[21:15:38] <Decker> why?
[21:15:57] <Simplar> if p = 2, then getting tails at least 2 times will lead to 2/4 = 1/2
[21:16:07] <Decker> right
[21:16:12] <Simplar> but getting tails at least 2 times when p = 2 is 1/4
[21:16:16] <Simplar> because we have 4 outcomes

[23:03:50] <lpapp> W: N^2 is not acceptable
[23:03:56] <memorye> riv could it be that there are infinitessimal Quantities, but they can't be applied to distances?
[23:03:58] <lpapp> also, this is a task for practicing caterpillar
[23:04:10] <memorye> yah i know R doesnt have them
[23:04:12] <memorye>  but reality
[23:04:13] <memorye>  has them
[23:04:14] <riv> yes a simple reference algorithm to compare an efficient algorithm aginst is useful
[23:04:31] <lpapp> 0, 1, 2, 1 returns 10
[23:04:32] <lpapp> odd
[23:04:49] <lpapp> I will go away to fix this, but if you fancy you can check the new algo if you see any probs with it, thanks! I will come back when I fixed it.
[23:04:50] <W> oh wait, that coincidentally gets it right, {0,1,2,3,1} then; you can verify that your loop counts front all the way to the end, and never compares the 1's
[23:04:59] <lpapp> right?
[23:05:17] <lpapp> it got it wrong :)

[23:05:55] <lpapp> I see what you mean
[23:06:08] <W> lpapp, the problem is an O(n) is _not_ trivial, due to the *'ed sequence I showed; a naive caterpillar will need to backtrack to find the duplicates of the new value once the front advances to one
[23:06:15] <lpapp> not A[back] = A[front], but something in-between equals A[front]

[23:06:25] <W> lpapp, it might still be possible, but it'd have to be something like finding monotone sequences or similar
[23:06:43] <lpapp> W: cannot you use a hash for this?
[23:06:49] <lpapp> to detect dups in the seq
[23:07:17] <W> yes, if you're fine with the additional space
[23:07:32] <lpapp> I guess the alternative is worse runtime complexity?
[23:07:34] <W> also complicates the increment
[23:07:54] <lpapp> can you do it without extra space in O(n)?
[23:08:25] <W> no like I said I _think_ there's a constant-space O(n) caterpillar-like thing (possibly advancing from both ends finding peaks and valleys) that could work, but it's too complicated for my poor brain to keep track of and too much work to work out on paper or code
[23:08:28] <lpapp> W: I have another idea
[23:09:04] <lpapp> {0,1,2,3,1} -> you advance back and increase the counter by front-back?
[23:09:16] <lpapp> you get 1, 2, 3, 1
[23:09:28] <lpapp> you advance back without changing the counter
[23:09:35] <lpapp> woudl that not work without extra space
[23:09:38] <lpapp> would*

[23:13:06] <lpapp> yes, I do not know if this can be done without extra complexity, either for time or space.
[23:13:16] <lpapp> good catch, thanks!
[23:14:34] <lpapp> 0,1,2,3,2,1 should return 15 unless I miscounted.
[23:14:39] <lpapp> Just adding a test for it.
[23:15:37] <W> if you're aware of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_climbing_problem, the "problem" in that doesn't appear for the kind of discrete sequences you have, and it should be possible to build a double-climber that always visits duplicates, and then probably can keep track of them in a stack to count unique slices
[23:15:58] <lpapp> yeah, but then you still need a stack with extra space, right?
[23:16:57] <W> there might be a simplification where you can just keep a number, but my focus has run out
[23:17:39] <W> you'd have to sit down and work out several example sequences and see what kind of pattern would emerge in overcounting if you don't keep track and if you can adjust
[23:19:10] <W> (e.g. some simple equation of previous duplicate and current duplicate and current count)

[23:42:08] <memorye> int-e but you you shouldnt say yes and no
[23:42:31] <memorye> even though a logical contradiction necessitates all statements
[23:42:44] <memorye>  a paradox is not necessarily a logical contradiction
[23:42:57] <memorye>  a paradox is something that LOOKS like a logical contradiction

[23:44:38] <int-e> ...
[23:45:15] <memorye> you can fill in the rest if you saw the original
[23:45:28] <int-e> and what does that have to do with math? logical paradoxes have /some/ relevance (set theoretical foundations were changed because of Russel's paradox)

[23:46:02] <memorye> int-e well earlier i asked riv this question which is paradoxical
[23:46:06] <int-e> And there's some debate about which axioms should be accepted based on their unintuitive consequences (Banach-Tarski and the axiom of choice)
[23:46:15] <memorye> Does the union of all the infinitessimal intervals with their left edge at 0 have an infinitessimal length?
[23:46:58] <int-e> And that's about where it stops being relevant.
[23:47:15] <memorye> thats where set theory does?
[23:47:38] <int-e> memorye: you have to be /very/ precise to make that a meaningful question. There are several ways to get infinitesimals.
[23:48:14] <int-e> But you'll probably find that the answer is no with any of them.
[23:48:23] <memorye> i was defining them as some quantity that is greater than 0 but less than all numbers of the form 1/n where n is an integer
[23:48:50] <int-e> right, now... what's a quantity?
[23:48:55] <memorye> int-e yeah but i am hoping that in pursuit of the answer i will find some treasure as is usually at the heart of a paradox
[23:49:15] <memorye> int-e thats the thing, i amnot sure all quantities can be expressed as distances
[23:49:32] <memorye> all the real numbers are quantities
[23:50:16] <memorye>  maybe the answer lies in talking about ordered sets? and ignoring distance?

[23:53:06] <memorye> well if you have two intervals [2, 6] and [2, 9]
[23:53:13] <memorye> their union is [2,9]
[23:53:30] <int-e> You have an infinite union. You may have a union of a proper class of intervals.
[23:53:47] <memorye> whether you look at it as sets of points or even as like distance stuff
[23:54:13] <memorye> set theory allows infinite unions right? is that what you are saying

[23:55:34] <int-e> It's a bit like the union of the closed intervals [0,1-1/n] for n in N being [0,1), except you can't even write it as an open interval since there's no least upper bounds because you've given up completeness when you added infinitesimals to your numbers
[23:56:42] <memorye> yes
[23:56:47] <memorye> thats the problem
[23:57:00] <int-e> Well, it's not a problem.
[23:57:44] <memorye> Thats comforting. i guess i'll have to take your word for it until i can feel it viscerally.
[23:59:22] <memorye> if its not a problem the answer has to be either yes or no
[23:59:33] <int-e> The answer is no, of course.
[23:59:34] <memorye> if its both or neither thats a problem
