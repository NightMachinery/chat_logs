[03:54:16] <flyback> looks like I am running freenas
[03:54:30] <flyback> because neither of the linux btrfs based distros know how to use btrfs
[03:54:39] <flyback> I give up
[03:54:42] <TimMc> flyback: That's pretty harsh. It sounded like christel was in a rough financial situation, and ultimately... it's just an IRC network. (And we didn't even lose it, just the name.)

[03:55:26] <flyback> feels like it

[03:55:45] <TimMc> I don't feel screwed over. *shrug*
[03:56:27] <flyback> I really wanted to run a btrfs based nas since I am already using btrfs on my data recovery boxes but it's not going to happen
[03:56:29] <flyback> it's too broken
[03:57:01] <flyback> openmediavault can't even configure the raid in the gui
[03:57:21] <TimMc> It was nice using freenode while it lasted, run by volunteers.
[03:57:23] <flyback> rockstor is in the middle of swapping distros so there's no point instaling the old one with a very old kernel

[17:35:51] <lacroix> either they bash on systemd just for the sake of bashing, or they just don't know what they're talking about. Or both.
[17:36:18] <thedragon> sorry for pasting it
[17:36:47] <lacroix> gdarko, e.g. I've provided a 7zip compressed file with a strong password over https, where I can validate that only the recipient has downloaded the file, and I have removed it from the webserver, before I pass along the password to unlock it.
[17:37:03] <lacroix> gdarko, Assuming webserver and the other persons machine are uncompromised, that is a pretty secure and reasonably easy way to share a file.
[17:37:34] <lacroix> thedragon, no worries, it's fine :) systemd keyword is just good for generating clicks *smile*

Reality policy is what you will actually get in trouble for by your supervisors, while "corporate policy" is meaningless drivel that supervisors use to justify their actions. If these policies don't line up, for example because supervisors are incentiviced to create different outcomes
[18:48:33] <calmclam> than how corporate policy reads, then you end up with this kafkaesque upside-down world where everyone has to pretend they follow corporate policy when in fact they don't.

[20:47:51] <TimMc> I would say that on most services, revealing that someone has registered is not very sensitive information.
[20:48:05] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[20:48:39] <rackj> Well, it's a paid service. We're using Stripe to charge their card. I haven't looked at Stripe API yet, but I'm guessing their actual card details are held by Stripe rather than by us.
[20:48:48] <TimMc> However, email confirmation does make it marginally easier to run password guessing attacks against your users.
[20:49:17] <spb> rackj: make the primary login ID the email address. have the first step of registration be to enter an email address and nothing else, then email them a link to enter the rest of the info you need
[20:49:19] <rackj> The user registration form is rate limited, so I guess that does go some way to prevent user enumeration attacks.
[20:49:25] <TimMc> (I strongly recommend using Pwned Passwords to prevent credential stuffing and other password guessing attacks.)
[20:49:35] <spb> unless they've already completed it, in which case you can just send them an email saying so and with a password reset option if needed
[20:49:48] <rackj> Yeah, we also have the 10k most common passwords, and we look those up first to prevent those passwords being used.
[20:50:08] <TimMc> That's good. I still recommend Pwned Passwords, though.

[20:51:46] <TimMc> spb: You're solving for secure, there, rather than user-friendly. :-)
[20:52:17] <TimMc> I actually ran into this recently and the email went into my spam folder, so I didn't get the email I should have.
[20:52:34] <TimMc> (making a password reset situation much worse)
[20:53:56] <rackj> I'm thinking the best route (for both security and user friendliness), is to just send a password reset email for existing accounts but to customize the email to say the account already exists.
[20:55:18] <rackj> Complete clarity for the user, avoids user enumeration, and an attacker will need to be able to login to the email address in order to know they already have an account.
[20:57:36] <TimMc> Just make sure that in the messaging on the website you include "check your spam folder if you don't see it".

[22:02:25] <lacroix> Either way. If you want new users to register, and choose their own username, you will probably ask for email in the next steo,

[22:58:09] <ttys000> As a business owner who has a lobby with free wifi.
[22:58:17] <ttys000> i would like to know what your thoughts are about facebook wifi.
[22:58:33] <ttys000> should i do it? is it a terrible idea for some security reasons?
[22:58:54] <NthDegree> ttys000, depends on the AP and your network configuration
[22:59:01] <NthDegree> Make sure the WiFi is on a separate VLAN
[22:59:06] <ttys000> oh, i mean i would put them on their own vlanf or sure.
[22:59:15] <NthDegree> ensure you have wireless isolation enabled to protect people from each other
[22:59:21] <ttys000> i just mean like what's facebook doing here, is it for datamining i guess?
[22:59:26] <ttys000> or something else nefarious
[22:59:32] <NthDegree> yeah they will datamine your users
[22:59:40] *** Joins: lacroix (~lacroix@about/linux/staff/lacroix)
[22:59:46] <NthDegree> they will know they've logged in using your WiFi

[23:00:04] <xiz> also i think there is some value from being able to push ads out to ppl at certain locations
[23:00:28] <NthDegree> If you're using a Unifi controller to do it make sure you patch that really well

[23:01:06] <NthDegree> Try to use Ubuntu LTS as the base OS and make it auto-patch and auto-reboot for each set of updates
[23:01:19] <NthDegree> you can always make it patch at like 2am or something
[23:01:39] <ttys000> my whole network is mikrotik. i think i would need to get a seperate device for the facebook wifi AP
[23:02:07] <NthDegree> and a box that runs the gateway no doubt
[23:02:18] <ttys000> seems like a bit of a pain tbh. lol. but my marketing guys are hot about it for SEO reasons.
[23:02:45] <NthDegree> ttys000, a cheap way is a Unifi AP and a Unifi Controller box on the separate VLAN
[23:03:01] <NthDegree> it has Facebook as an authentication method
[23:03:36] <NthDegree> and you can still choose to put a WPA password on top if you wanted
[23:03:46] <NthDegree> and put a QR code for it inside your establishment
[23:04:06] <NthDegree> so that way they need to at least go inside your place to scan the code :P

[23:04:43] <NthDegree> As an example
[23:04:59] <ttys000> hmm interesting. thanks.
[23:05:03] <MadCamel> Just give people free wifi. Limiting it to those who are okay with facebook's datamining is a dick move.
[23:05:18] <ttys000> Oh we have free wifi already, with a QR code, etc.
[23:05:25] <NthDegree> ttys000, you do also have the option of having a non-facebook second SSID on the same AP
[23:05:43] <NthDegree> so you could QR code that one
[23:05:49] <NthDegree> and reserve it for your customers
