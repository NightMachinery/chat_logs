[00:00:35] <ebrasca> I get "Package CLASS* does not exist." , I have no idea from what place to get it!
[00:00:40] <waleee> aloha
[00:01:00] <waleee> ebrasca: do you use the makefile to build?
[00:01:15] <ebrasca> I load it with my sbcl and git
[00:01:37] <waleee> using quicklisp?
[00:01:51] <ebrasca> Yes
[00:02:27] <waleee> you need to update the quicklisp dist probably, the previous one had an older version of dwim.BLAHA.class-star
[00:02:52] <waleee> BLAHA=the long-ish name they actually have for the package
[00:03:25] <waleee> ebrasca: it this package https://github.com/hu-dwim/hu.dwim.defclass-star
[00:05:59] <ebrasca> Updated quicklisp and nyxt loaded fine!
[00:07:24] <ebrasca> What is phos library ?
[00:07:56] <waleee> it's a gemini client library
[00:08:19] <waleee> aartaka added support for gopher and gemini with a "small-web-mode"
[00:08:49] <waleee> ebrasca: https://github.com/omar-polo/phos
[00:08:56] <ebrasca> Is geminigemini something like html?
[00:09:19] <waleee> kind of a plaintext html without javascript
[00:09:50] <ebrasca> Are there pages in this protocol ?
[00:10:04] <waleee> but unlike the ancient gopher-protocol you have some binary blob support so eg. pictures are possible
[00:10:34] <waleee> eg drew devault's gemini://drewdevault.com
[00:10:52] <waleee> but it's mostly enthusiasts
[00:11:19] <ebrasca> How to open this page in nyxt?
[00:11:56] <ebrasca> C-l did not work
[00:12:28] <waleee> if you have phos in ~/quicklisp/local-projects or ~/common-lisp when building it should work just by opening the url
[00:13:15] <waleee> (the library is not in quicklisp)
[00:13:47] <ebrasca> I know , I have read the error mensage when loading nyxt.
[00:16:12] <ebrasca> Did you add an addbloker ?
[00:17:46] <waleee> ebrasca: you have rudimentary host-based adblocking atm via blocker-mode and a auto-updated hostlist (no intervention needed)
[00:19:07] <waleee> and the WIP support for web-extensions should enable you to use the ones from eg firefox and chrome/-ium

[00:21:57] <GoodCodeGuy> Hello all, here's a question probably documeted somewhere. If I wanted to start helping out with code on Nyxt or developing extensions for it, where would be a good starting place
[00:22:11] <GoodCodeGuy> am proficient dev, relatively new to lisp but learning
[00:23:19] <waleee> GoodCodeGuy: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/documents/README.org and how a basic extension is tructured, https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nx-fruit
[00:24:36] <GoodCodeGuy> you are a gentleman (or woman) and scholar. thank you
[00:25:26] <waleee> I take gentleman :P
[00:25:33] <ebrasca> I think the best way is to use nyxt and see what you can do better!
[00:26:10] <ebrasca> If you ask others to give you a task it may be boring!
[00:37:56] <GoodCodeGuy> that is fair. I'm still pretty new to emacs and lisp. But it's all been quite intriguing (and frankly, I get it, pretty)
[00:38:22] <GoodCodeGuy> so probably will not be creating anything too magical yet. but will get there. I just found this blog post too which looks promising

[02:04:05] <lagash> ebrasca: I use it for some browsing activities, like searching up music lyrics and downloading them from YT etc
[02:04:43] <ebrasca> How do you search saved links by tags?
[02:05:00] <ebrasca> (I don't like to send the data to the internet)
[02:08:29] <lagash> you mean history? or bookmarks?
[02:10:36] <waleee> possibly the annotations
[02:11:58] <waleee> ebrasca: are referring to https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/annotations.org ?
[02:12:53] <ebrasca> waleee: No
[02:13:05] <ebrasca> lagash: I mean bookmarks
[02:20:50] <waleee> so you want to disable the ddg suggestions in the prompt?
[02:21:17] <waleee> and prefarably have the history as the first prompter source listed?
[02:21:46] <waleee> s/history/bookmarks/
[02:25:33] <ebrasca> Probably yes!
[02:27:35] <waleee> for the ddg suggestions I think you need to override this variable in your config, https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/a645ed180386016d0b3db06ddf73a64b94d3c8f3/source/buffer.lisp#L67
[02:28:24] <waleee> hm maybe not
[02:29:15] <waleee> it would be an extremly invasive way to disable them
[02:33:37] <waleee> ebrasca: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/pull/1933#issuecomment-992468926
[02:59:39] <ebrasca> waleee: It is not fully disabled!
[03:01:33] <waleee> hm weird, seems to be for me
[03:02:16] <waleee> you added it to ~/.config/nyxt/init.lisp ?
[03:03:47] <ebrasca> Yes , I can still see one ddg at the start!
[03:04:10] <ebrasca> I like to have it like before , tags at the top!
[03:04:36] <waleee> ah, that should be unrelated. Does it disappear if you idle a bit?
[03:04:51] <ebrasca> No
[03:05:15] <ebrasca> I have also restarted it
[03:05:49] <waleee> what's the url you enter?
[03:06:11] <ebrasca> I am searching urls with tags
[03:06:56] <ebrasca> like "video" "librecmc" and others
[03:07:17] <waleee> aha, then the source with the header "New URL or search query" will indeed show "ddg" in the "Search engine?" column
[03:07:43] <ebrasca> Yes , I like to see tags first
[03:07:43] <waleee> but no search or data should be sent unless you execute the query as far as I can tell
[03:10:35] <ebrasca> How to make the search to show tags first?
[03:20:21] <waleee> ebrasca: aha! There's a set-url-from-bookmark command
[03:22:00] <waleee> the default keybindning for your mode should be listed when you enter it

[03:27:09] <waleee> so the current answer to "how to rearrange the prompt sources?" is to make a new command, or override eg set-url with one that has the sources in a different order, https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/a645ed180386016d0b3db06ddf73a64b94d3c8f3/source/buffer.lisp#L1476

[19:48:26] <lagash> So, how do I add a dependency to Nyxt? (It's cl-tld) Aren't they pinned as git submodules? Perhaps someone could add documentation on the procedure?
[19:50:00] <waleee> something along: 1) add submodule 2) add to nyxt.asd afaik
[19:50:45] <lagash> OK but I have little experience with submodules - can my pull request add a submodule?
[19:51:06] <lagash> And aren't we still giving the option to use Quicklisp, too?
[19:52:55] <waleee> lagash: you can use quicklisp still. Ambrevar added some logic that checks & sets the default source/package path, and if you build nyxt using quicklisp it uses it's paths
[19:55:05] <lagash> waleee: OK but are we just using the latest... distro? So no "pinning" beyond that, for Quicklisp?
[19:55:24] <waleee> lagash: specifically this code in the makefile https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/makefile#L27
[19:55:49] <waleee> lagash: you use the quicklisp dist you have on your system
[19:56:10] <waleee> it isn't auto-updated
[19:56:44] <lagash> Oh? But generally the devs are tracking the latest one?
[19:57:05] <lagash> Or is it more of a "you're on your own if you use Quicklisp" sorta deal?
[19:57:51] <waleee> the latter I think aartaka and jmercouris would agreee on?
[19:58:48] <jmercouris> Indeed, the later
[19:58:52] <jmercouris> Latter*
[19:58:55] <waleee> lagash: it's more that the quicklisp maintainer (Xach in #commonlisp, I think) checks if it builds with the quicklisp dist
[19:59:17] <jmercouris> We do try to make it still work with QL, but it isn’t ultra priority
[20:00:28] <waleee> jmercouris: what's the procedure for adding a submodule? (piggy backing on lagash's question)
[20:00:49] <lagash> I'm trying to resolve at least part of https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1876 in case anyone was wondering :)
[20:01:14] <jmercouris> waleee: I use magit, so I don’t know how to do it via CLI
[20:01:22] <jmercouris> Basically you just add it
[20:01:39] <lagash> jmercouris: I use Magit too, but only minimally. What command(s) do you use?
[20:01:49] <jmercouris> I’ll need to turn on my computer
[20:01:55] <jmercouris> I can’t remember
[20:01:58] <jmercouris> Oh you know what
[20:02:02] <jmercouris> Here is the easiest way
[20:02:10] <jmercouris> Look at the git submodules file
[20:02:14] <jmercouris> It’s incredibly simple
[20:02:28] <jmercouris> And just copy the last entry and modify it for CL-tld
[20:02:35] <waleee> hm I hoped ebrasca would be around, I remembered that this article existed https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/prompt-buffer-customization.org after I /quit:ed
[20:02:37] <jmercouris> Like just follow the template
[20:02:55] <jmercouris> Don’t worry waleee , Bruno will be back
[20:03:01] <jmercouris> He always comes and leaves at random times
[20:03:12] <lagash> Oh, I forgot it was an actual file, heh
[20:03:27] <lagash> "We don't talk about Bruno, no no no!"
[20:03:30] <jmercouris> That’s ok
[20:03:40] <jmercouris> You know, you’ve been around for thousands of years
[20:03:46] <jmercouris> You are bound to forget things
[20:05:03] <lagash> I'm not Ganesha, after all!
[20:05:08] <jmercouris> Yes
[20:05:31] <lagash> So no one's assigned #1876?
[20:05:58] * waleee is getting pawned by the Swedish wordle-clone
[20:06:14] <lagash> Wait, the .gitmodule file doesn't pin the submodules?! Is there somewhere else in the code it does?
[20:07:19] <waleee> I think you add a checkout in the _build dir
[20:08:00] <lagash> Hmm? Where is that stored now?
[20:08:09] <waleee> ttps://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/master/_build
[20:08:27] <waleee> +h
[20:09:32] <lagash> I mean, I know that, I didn't remember _build being there until after I compiled things..?
[20:10:15] <waleee> it's always there, the submodule dirs are just empty until you initialize them
[20:10:29] <waleee> * the submodule dirs inside it
[20:10:58] <waleee> lagash: I boomarked just now, https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/
[20:11:27] <lagash> Why are some of the dirs blue and others not? Perhaps some of them are off-site?
[20:11:29] <waleee> ... * this just now
[20:12:13] <waleee> yeah, I think the unblue ones are not on github
[20:12:21] <lagash> Boo GitHub
[20:12:46] <waleee> yes, eg alexandria is on gitlab
[20:14:11] <lagash> I take it the makefile or whatnot updates the submodules to whatever was pinned?
[20:14:57] <aartaka> lagash: If you need a particular version of a submodule, you'll also need to check is out at this version and commit this submodule dir.
[20:16:55] <waleee> honestly I don't get why the .gitmodules format doesn't have field for the commit
[20:16:57] <lagash> And by default it just checks out master?
[20:17:08] <lagash> waleee: see? that's what was confusing me
[20:17:37] <waleee> it will be the version and branch you git commit
[20:18:15] <waleee> (as aartaka said)
[20:19:17] <lagash> `git submodule add https://github.com/lu4nx/cl-tld _build/cl-tld` seemed to do the trick, git status says "new file:   _build/cl-tld"

[20:52:00] <jmercouris> “That was sent by night”
[20:52:06] <jmercouris> Did I translate correct?
[20:52:29] <waleee> hehe 5/10 google-translate brownie points
[20:53:20] <waleee> "det var" = it was, "sent på natten" = late at night
[20:53:42] <aartaka> "sent" = "late"? 0_o
[20:54:04] <waleee> yep. But not pronounced like the english word
[20:54:27] <waleee> the e is long and has some pitch accent
[20:56:06] <aartaka> waleee: I don't want to be annoying, but have you seen my message? :)
