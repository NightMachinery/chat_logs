[03:49:36] <bremner> cworth: any ideas what is going on with ikiwiki on arlo? https://paste.debian.net/1224590/
[03:50:59] <cworth> Oops. It looks very confused certainly.
[03:51:10] <cworth> I can look, but probably not until tomorrow morning.
[03:51:26] <bremner> cworth: ok. it's only preventing pushes, so that will do
[03:51:30] <cworth> I'm assuming we still have working web content and just broken updating for the time being? Or is the live site...
[03:51:33] <cworth> OK, good.

[20:13:15] <dob1> about compressed email message (gzipped) notmuch is able to index them, right?
[20:13:54] <dob1> from version 0.29
[20:14:30] <dob1> the problem is with notmuch-mutt, even mutt or neomutt will not handle them
[20:25:28] <bremner> dob1: you will probably get better help with neomutt in #neomutt
[20:26:40] <dob1> bremner, just asked, no support
[20:27:00] <bremner> ok.
[20:33:01] <dob1> I used a workaround in the notmuch-mutt script on the search function https://dpaste.com/4UC9Z2WU8   maybe there is a better solution
[20:35:03] <dob1> but this was years ago, I was hoping neomutt to support it
[20:35:26] <bremner> indeed. I would prefer to stop shipping notmuch-mutt at some point
[20:37:04] <dob1> the official client is the emacs one, right?
[20:38:50] <bremner> it's the client I and several other notmuch contributors use.
[20:39:23] <bremner> It's certainly the best supported of the clients that ship with notmuch
[20:41:20] <dob1> to be honest, just my 2 cents, I find mutt/neomutt more intuitive
[20:41:31] <dob1> maybe it's because I don't use emacs
[20:41:36] <bremner> probably
[20:54:30] <bremner> dob1: did the neomutt people suggest making a feature request?
[20:56:03] <dob1> bremner, not a very friendly channel
[20:56:52] <dob1> I asked about compressed email message several times, even if there were some developers talking nobody answered me, after sometimes I repeated the question they said no
[20:58:05] <dob1> the strange thing is that they support "Compressed Folders"  I don't know what are them...

[21:00:20] <bookworm> it's actually a very friendly channel. But the lead dev is a) short on time and b) doesn't use notmuch himself
[21:00:43] <bookworm> if however you'd send a patch implementing this you usually get helpful code review
[21:01:05] <bookworm> or you can ask the maintainer / main author of the notmuch codepath
[21:01:25] <dob1> bookworm, I just share my experience
[21:02:14] <bookworm> not sure what you found "unfriendly" about a literal "no sorry"
[21:05:40] <dob1> bookworm, this is when I get an answered and I thanks for it, but I asked it other times before this and nobody answered. Just to be clear I don't pretend an answer, don't get me wrong I thanks the people for all the free support on irc.  just saying that I was ignored, just this. maybe I used the wrong term with "not a very friendly", my bad
[21:14:26] <dob1> but there is some type of support for notmuch https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/master/notmuch
[21:25:37] <bookworm> indeed, guess how I read email ;)
[21:31:09] <cworth> bookworm: That wasn't "guess how often I read email", right? :-)
