[00:04:53] <quanticle> Also, re: switching from D-R, apparently what swung the gubernatorial election in Virginia was the fact that Democrats alienated the Asian-American vote wrt education. There are a lot of South Asians in Northern Virginia, because of government contractors and their associated IT jobs, and Terry McAuliffe talking about how he was going to improve Black enrollment at highly selective high schools
[00:04:54] <quanticle> (apparently the high-schools in that area are top-10 in the entire nation) did not go over well with a group of people who grew up with the notion of "Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes" in their home country.

[00:05:49] <quanticle> Of course, the Republicans don't understand this either
[00:05:54] <quanticle> Because they're stupid too
[00:06:00] <quanticle> They think it's about "critical race theory"
[00:07:29] <quanticle> Which it is, in a way, but not in the way that the Republicans think it is. It's not about people being outraged that critical race theory concepts are being taught in the classroom, it's more about people being outraged about critical race theory being taught in the teacher's lounge
[00:07:59] <Betawolf> I mean, good, that's at least closer to the root of the problem.

[01:53:51] <quanticle> So what you're saying is that the only solution is realy claymore mines
[01:56:16] <saturn2> you need an automated machine gun turret that continually shoots everywhere in the yard except where the children are

[01:58:11] <quanticle> Dude doesn't realize that machine guns are far too rare and expensive to use for shooting hogs
[01:58:37] <saturn2> WILLIE: It was probably mid-morning. It was a spring day and my wife, she liked the kids to be outside and play, and I would too, and I’m sure she’s the one that let them out that morning to go outside. And we had a little playground set up in the backyard. And uh, she just, she just yells out, “There’s pigs! All in the yard! Everywhere!”
[01:58:39] <saturn2> PJ: Did she sound scared?
[01:58:41] <saturn2> WILLIE: She did. You could hear it in her voice
[01:58:43] <saturn2> PJ: Willie told me the reason his wife was scared is these weren’t like, barnyard pigs, they were feral hogs. They’re more like wild boars – some have big sharp tusks, they’re much bigger, with longer legs. They move really fast. And that moment, there was a bunch of them swarming around his 4 and 5 year old. It was scary.
[01:58:45] <saturn2> WILLIE: I went to my safe. I got my gun. I got my shells. Went right out on the back porch.
[01:58:47] <saturn2> PJ: And how were the hogs acting? Were they like moving quickly? Were they–
[01:58:49] <saturn2> WILLIE: Well, yeah. You know, they’re running all through the yard from the back of my yard all the way to the front. And then I pick out, of course, the ones that look the meanest. The one with the tusk. These are two or three hundred pound hogs. I’m not letting them near my family. 
[01:58:51] <saturn2> PJ: Yeah–
[01:58:53] <saturn2> WILLIE: So, just for lack of a better term, I just start laying them down. 
[01:58:55] <saturn2> PJ: Willie shoots three with his hunting rifle, and the rest of the hogs run off. Afterwards, he was just bewildered. He’d never seen anything like this before.So he started looking for answers.

[02:01:14] <gwern> but there are machine guns all over rural hick america! I'm sure I read it in the NYT or on NPR
[02:02:26] <quanticle> nshepperd: No the original thing was about *assault* rifles
[02:02:31] <quanticle> i.e. scary-looking black guns
[02:03:32] <quanticle> Dude was asking, if you take away my AR-15 or w/e how am I going to deal with feral hogs
[02:03:33] <nshepperd> oh i see
[02:04:09] <nshepperd> and those are semi auto
[02:04:17] <quanticle> Yeah
[02:04:41] <saturn2> just wrap your AR-15 with adhesive vinyl woodgrain, then it's not an assault weapon anymore
[02:04:50] <quanticle> Which, if you're going to put down three or four hogs in quick succession, yeah, I can see the value of semi-auto and a deep magazine.
[02:05:26] <quanticle> saturn2: Yeah, but that doesn't do you much good if people decide that semi-auto in general should be banned.
[02:05:50] <Betawolf> the compromise to save america is you can buy any armaments you want but they're all only available in rainbow flag patterns

[07:25:12] <adiabatic> how long does $200 of Uber credit last?
[07:25:34] <ggreer> well the credits expire in 2 days so.... 2 days
[07:25:52] <ggreer> it's a bit of a perverse incentive. I've been using uber a lot today

[17:31:02] <Robomot> Benjamin Pitt (@BenPitt): "People have long argued about how people get number concepts like 7 and 42. Are they just naturally part of the human conceptual repertoire? Or do you need to have a set of symbols, like the number words “one, two, thee…”, to think exact number thoughts?"
[17:31:02] <Robomot> Benjamin Pitt (@BenPitt): "In other words, if they knew how to say the number words only up to 10, then they could copy sets of objects up to about 10, but no further. For 11 and up, they’d fall back on numerical approximation.."
[17:31:03] <Robomot> Benjamin Pitt (@BenPitt): "Findings like this also bear on one of the oldest and most debated questions in cognitive science: Can language give people new conceptual abilities? These findings suggest the answer is: Yes, at least in the domain of numbers."

[21:02:07] <gwern> two2thehead: what I tend to take the cognition/language literature so far as indicating that language is sufficient but not necessary for many concepts/capabilities
[21:03:30] <gwern> surely you don't *need* language to manipulate numbers. they aren't the same thing, and animals and humans can do number stuff without language for at least small numbers. people without inner monologue also seem to do math fine. but it seems like we need language as a scaffolding to crystallize out the concept/capability
[21:04:20] <gwern> maybe a transhuman primate with 3x our brain size could develop numbers without any language at all. but we at least seem to need it and haven't found any better way to elicit it
[21:04:40] <two2thehead> gwern, hmm
[21:04:56] <gwern> sort of like how you can scale a NN model 100x on random internet data, or with *very careful* data selection train an equivalently powerful model with 1% the parameters
[21:05:10] <gwern> it's just a constant factor on the scaling laws... but what a constant
[21:05:17] <two2thehead> okay, you're probably right. gwern +1
[21:05:36] <two2thehead> in my defense, I skew heavily verbal so...
[21:05:42] <gwern> this is a controversial position, but it's the one I tend to when I combine what I know of NNs and childhood development and feral children etc
[21:06:56] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : read above gwern. very interesting
[21:07:55] <two2thehead> i don't think I've ever seen the phrase 'sufficient but not necessary for many concepts/capabilities' used like that before

[21:08:56] <two2thehead> '

[21:09:12] *** Joins: galambo__ (~galambo@user/galambo)
[21:09:45] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: it's definitely hard. whether it's infeasible is a different question. just pooling all the constructed datasets so far turns out to work pretty well. but that might have exhausted the low-hanging fruit compared to 'dump in another terabyte of internet text lol'
[21:10:20] <gwern> 'we combined all the NLP test sets we found and it weighs 1gb. we have the compute for another 100GB of text. now what?'
[21:11:09] <gwern> researchers so far have focused more on filtering out low-quality stuff than on finding the really challenging useful text
[21:11:43] <gwern> that hasn't been much of a specific research direction yet. mostly treated as an engineering effort. 'yeah we deduplicated by hash, threw out anything with "javascript" in it etc'
[21:12:21] <gwern> but stuff like providing simple programs with output transcripts or simple step-by-step math proofs/problems, that sort of thing, not really
[21:13:03] *** Quits: galambo_ (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[21:13:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I see. we use a ton of low quality data because on aggregate they are good enough. However, an "ubermensch" dataset would be very small, but be extremely high quality and useful
[21:13:40] <PapuaHardyNet> but building the ubermensch dataset would require a lot of high human compute, which researchers do not believe they can afford
[21:14:01] <gwern> yes. my theory is that you'd want to train by putting the low-quality data first, and then the gold quality data at the very end to take the final most intelligent model possible on the bulk data and try to shove it into a new regime of intelligence
[21:14:16] <gwern> before the end, it's too stupid to benefit
[21:14:38] <gwern> and yeah, just getting these models working at all is such a big barrier that optimizing the individual pieces isn't a priority

[22:02:54] <zebrask> With a known Quantum RNG you can basically say, "OK all the permutations are equally-thick slices of the world", whereas the entropy sources may be favoring one distribution over another. I'm guessing they aren't because of the central limit theorem or whatever, but it'd be good to know if someone has thought this through well enough to say one way or the other.
[22:03:27] <rmmh> there's a trivial way to debias independent random bit sources
[22:03:43] <gwern> zebrask: of course, simple randomization does have downsides, but at the macro scale, not quantum. you randomize and you wind up with 70 fat people in one arm and 20 in the other, or something. each covariate may probably be balanced, but across all of them, they will be substantially unbalanced. inefficient. which is why you have stratification and propensity matching and antithetic sampling...
[22:03:47] <rmmh> take 2 bits. reject 00 and 11. 01 -> 0. 10 -> 1.
[22:03:49] <gwern> ...to randomize but ensure balance
[22:04:33] <rmmh> even if you get a 0 bit 90% of the time, as long as the successive bits are *uncorrelated*, you get a lovely 50-50 distribution
[22:05:44] <zebrask> gwern: Sure, but I am mainly just thinking that  it's probably only fair for the distribution of an individual's MWI descendants' outcomes should match the statistics of how they were deliberately selected into various groups.

[23:13:53] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The new research — likely the first to systematically document such injuries — came about by chance. Dr. White had originally been working with the Zambian government on a project that photographed the skulls and hides of adult male lions and leopards that had been legally hunted as trophies in Zambia’s Luangwa Valley and Greater Kafue Ecosystem. The archived photos
[23:13:53] <feepbot> were the starting point for the new study. While examining the skulls, Dr. White and Dr. Van Valkenburgh found that a startling 37 percent of 112 lions and 22 percent of 45 leopards had evidence of being snared at some point in their lives. And 27 percent of the lions had been hit in the face with shotgun pellets. The results are almost certainly an underestimate. For the snaring
[23:13:53] <feepbot> calculations, the researchers only considered animals that had both tooth wear and corresponding scars on their hides — not those that had only tooth wear. For the shotgun estimates, they were only able to examine images of the animals’ skulls, not their entire skeletons. As Dr. White said, “Our reported numbers are conservatively low, even though they are high.”'

[23:29:22] <gwern> yes. it's extremely cheap and safe and it's not like people have been getting *more* sunlight the past few years
