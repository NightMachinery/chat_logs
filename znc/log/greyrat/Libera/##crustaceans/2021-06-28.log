[06:50:54] <jjuran> Then again, we have central air here
[06:50:57] <ngoldbaum> beautiful cirrus and cumulus, 72°
[06:51:07] <ngoldbaum> blue skies, no smoke
[06:51:48] <bkero> I have no AC. The house was built in 2010 but the original buyer apparently didn't want to pay $2000 to get the option.
[06:51:49] <jjuran> sounds lovelu
[06:51:51] <jjuran> lovely
[06:52:14] <jjuran> the blue skies and 72F, I mean
[06:52:35] <ngoldbaum> went for a long bike ride
[06:52:46] <jjuran> I lived in a 90s-built high rise in Seattle with no AC.
[06:53:17] <bkero> One of these days I need to bite the bullet and drop $10k on a badass split system.
[06:53:24] <jjuran> There's a very obvious logic fail in the statement "We opted not to install X, because you mostly don't need it."

[06:54:52] <ngoldbaum> jjuran: and yet most housing on the west coast is built on the assumption it never gets hot or cold
[06:55:01] <ngoldbaum> despite ample evidence to the contrary
[06:55:40] <jjuran> I don't think I witnessed a single year in Seattle which didn't have two weeks where it was 90F
[06:55:53] <ngoldbaum> otoh the east coast is all awful prewar construction with radiators that are either on or off :p
[06:56:13] <jjuran> This house was 80s'built
[06:56:46] <jjuran> But a multi-level house with a single thermal system has its own tradeoffs
[06:57:52] <jjuran> The upstairs is never cooled enough; the basement gets warmed or cooled to excess in extreme temperatures.
[06:58:59] <bkero> It's possible to add zones to a single thermal system by the use of motorized dampers
[06:59:18] <bkero> That would be one solution to add air conditioning to my home. I'd rather rip the furnace out and replace it with a heat pump though.
[06:59:36] <ngoldbaum> the house i’m in now has an addition with zero ventilation
[06:59:45] <ngoldbaum> and the addition is the master bedrolm

[13:16:48] <gerikson> mouseghost: why do you think so, seriously?
[13:16:58] <quanticle> I feel like C# is less eww than Java on HN, because the .Net ecosystem has F#, haha

[13:17:22] <mouseghost> gerikson, it feels... heavy ;x

[13:47:10] <gerikson> but it brings home the bacon
[13:47:34] <gerikson> software development is like 15% actually coding, the rest of the time is trying to figure out what the customer wats

[15:22:20] <Brekkjern> My experience with Java was just that it's cumbersome to do anything since everything has to be a self defined method and it's suffering a bit from every object being a minimal implementation, so you have to pass a lot of objects through some boilerplate to get things done
[15:23:03] <Brekkjern> I miss the dunder methods of Python to make the code much cleaner
[15:24:06] <Brekkjern> Stuff like "vector3 = vector1 + vector2" is much more clear than "Vector<SomeType> vector3 = vector1.add(vector2)"
[15:25:20] <Brekkjern> Under the hood it's the same, but the explicit method of the second example makes you have to check what it's doing. Is it mutating vector1, or does it make a new Vector? Who knows?

[15:34:32] <gerikson> Brekkjern: what grinds my gears about that kind of systemd discussion is that Linux as a meta-project should bend over backwards to accomodate projects whose very existence is predicated on them being Not Linux
[15:36:06] <Geekingfrog> what do you mean by "predicated on them being not linux"?
[15:36:09] * Geekingfrog is a noob
[15:36:51] <gerikson> on a certain level, people use FreeBSD because it's different
[15:37:01] <gerikson> it's to encourage diversity in computing
[15:37:26] <gerikson> and scratch around and you'll see a lot of reactions like "well that's how it's done on Linux, but here on *BSD we do it this way"
[15:38:07] <gerikson> so now systemd is here and it's objectively better in some ways, and you can't turn the ship around and *like* the stuff Linux does
[15:38:07] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
[15:38:38] <gerikson> yeah, hating on GNU is another foundation stone of the *BSD identity
[15:38:41] <Brekkjern> Honestly, at this point there has been so much divergent evolution in these spaces that people should just be happy if something works cross-platform
[15:38:49] <gerikson> yeah
[15:39:07] <Brekkjern> Linux is now its own thing. BSDs are now their own things.
[15:39:28] <gerikson> POSIX wasn't a happy utopia, it was a bunch of compeittors who got togehter, guns to their heads, to hammer out a minimal standard

[15:40:25] <buttsbot> Despite all the jokes, Paul was neither micro, nor soft. He ungagged Richard and then shoved all nine inches into Richard's throat. Richard gagged and tried to cough, but still found himself in the throes of utmost pleasure. He was accustomed to Microsoft dominating the industry, and now Microsoft was dominating him.

[15:55:53] <geoffwozniak> pja: yeah, I have a vaccine receipt.
[15:56:00] <martian67> but to state it out loud is a new level of hilarity

[15:56:35] <geoffwozniak> pja: basically, to reschedule my appointment I'm to supply my confirmation number. I do so and it tells me it doesn't know about it. It knows my wife's, though
