I wish for an explanation as if to an idiot.
[06:03:30] <wuldor> I actually achieved it in the past and it wasn't complex, now when I look at documentation it's very badly explained, for someone like me.

[06:03:48] <pulse> yeah i get that but computer graphics is actually a highly expansive field

[16:15:32] <Corwinoid> Which probably isn't as inaccurate as you'd think
[16:15:54] <[itchyjunk]> that depends where
[16:15:57] <arahael> Corwinoid: That's not going to cut it in my area.
[16:16:05] <[itchyjunk]> you have liek 70% to own houses in rural areas etc
[16:16:09] <Corwinoid> "not going to cut it" isn't really a refutation
[16:16:26] <InPhase> arahael: If prices are rising and there are lots of vacanacies, then there are some market shenanigans going on.  If prices are rising but people are still paying the rising rent prices, then what is likely happening is that the people paying that rent have some way to afford it, and there are enough of them that they squeeze out other people from the city.  This sometimes happen to the point of it 
[16:16:32] <InPhase> being a serious issue, but it is about income disparity and finite supply when it goes that route.
[16:16:39] <arahael> InPhase: There damned are market shenangigans going on.
[16:16:55] <Corwinoid> InPhase: there *are* shenanigans going on
[16:17:29] <arahael> InPhase: We have negative gearing, which is OK, actually.  But we are perhaps unique (as far as I'm aware), in that we are able to *leverage* into housing so easily.  In general, there is no better investment than to buy a house.
[16:17:34] <merijn> Foreign investors buying up a substantial fraction of all available houses tends to fuck with pricing >.>
[16:17:41] <arahael> That, too.
[16:17:48] <Corwinoid> There's almost no question that the housing market is being played with somewhere, but naive "we can't afford houses in X location" isn't a market analysis that approaches it either

[16:25:46] <InPhase> arahael: I have paid only slightly less than renting would have been so far on the homes I've owned.  I was able to go back and estimate the total cost of ownership after each point where I sold a home, and compare it to renting, and it only came out a little bit cheaper.  Which is about right, it should be a little bit cheaper because it requires more up front money, which adjusts the pricing.  It

[17:20:14] <mrig> only the paranoid schizophrenics are considered unclean, by those who throw stones
[17:20:14] <[itchyjunk]> It's a serious and sad illness.
[17:20:17] <pyzozord> yeah it is not necessairly an illness from what I understand
[17:20:27] <[itchyjunk]> It is a mental illness.
[17:20:37] <[itchyjunk]> Maybe understandings need to change.

[17:21:49] <pyzozord> or eat raw ones

[17:22:55] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, calling it a "belief system" is what got a lot of schiz's killed.

[17:23:28] <[itchyjunk]> psychocis is illness
[17:23:41] <mawk> it's not "another way to view the world" or a "belief system" like autism
[17:23:49] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: I would argue that it is a symptom of a social diseases.
[17:23:54] <mawk> it's a major dysfunctionment in your brain
[17:23:55] <[itchyjunk]> mawk, good thing modern medicine actually studies these things
[17:23:59] <mrig> And have proof of that.
[17:24:08] <[itchyjunk]> instead of "world is just waht you believe in " newage crap

[17:24:16] <mawk> you are broken, you are sick
[17:24:17] <mrig> mawk: It is a symptom

[17:24:28] <pyzozord> well no need to get up in arms about this stuff
[17:24:30] <[itchyjunk]> symptom of an illness
[17:24:31] <[itchyjunk]> lmfao
[17:24:36] <mawk> no it's not a symptom, it's a syndrome
[17:24:52] <mawk> it's a generic "you" pyzozord 
[17:24:54] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, outside of first world countries, schizs die because of this mindset
[17:25:04] <mrig> I would state that if schizophrenia is an illness so is psychopathy.
[17:25:04] <[itchyjunk]> they are treated as someone no sick with just a weird mindset
[17:25:08] <mawk> I'm not talking to mrig, I'm describing what psychosis is
[17:25:18] <[itchyjunk]> and are held accountable for it and die in prison or streets
[17:25:20] <mrig> mawk: I study this.
[17:25:21] <pyzozord> schizophrenia is not a binary switch
[17:25:25] <mawk> schizophrenia isn't just having eccentric ideas mrig
[17:25:33] <mawk> you don't equate it to autism or psychopathy
[17:25:42] <mrig> mawk: I am actively researching this.
[17:25:50] <[itchyjunk]> schiz is a pretty distinct thing from "belief system"
[17:25:50] <mawk> yeah, maybe you shouldn't then
[17:25:56] <[itchyjunk]> thinking the world is flat is a belief system
[17:25:59] <[itchyjunk]> and not schiz.

[17:26:06] <mawk> I know a antivax doctor too
[17:26:10] <[itchyjunk]> same

[17:26:24] <mrig> man you guys are indoctrinated :P
[17:26:31] <mawk> schizophrens have miserable lives, it's not a belief system

[17:26:37] <mrig> sad to say it but profoundly true.
[17:26:47] <mawk> and I know it first hand, maybe you research it but I've experienced it
[17:26:54] <mawk> so better ask directly the concerned person no?
[17:26:56] <[itchyjunk]> when people think you fall downwards because gravity is a "belief system"
[17:26:57] <mrig> mawk: even the ones that experience 
[17:27:01] <mrig> god
[17:27:09] <mawk> so when they're miserable it's a belief system?
[17:27:12] <mrig> and spend their lives in bliss?
[17:27:18] <dTal> you *perceive* downwards motion :p
[17:27:20] <mawk> is an amputated limb a belief system?
[17:27:23] <mrig> you dont know what you are talking about :P
[17:27:34] * mrig chuckles
[17:27:37] <mawk> I wouldn't use the word bliss to what happened to me, mrig
[17:27:47] <[itchyjunk]> dTal, yes but gravity exists outside a belief system
[17:27:52] <[itchyjunk]> you can't think it away
[17:27:53] <mrig> mawk: well it is different from person to person, 
[17:27:55] <[itchyjunk]> just like schiz
[17:27:59] <dTal> So you believe.

[17:32:26] <mrig> mawk: cancer has some interesting links to the same study that covers the onset of psychosis; My hypothesis is that they are symptomatic of the same underlying ebb and flow.
[17:32:26] <pyzozord> mrig: [itchyjunk] has clearly built a big portion of his value system and self understanding on those fundaments, he is probably protecting much more than we can see on the surface
[17:32:45] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, i've worked with people with mental illness

[17:32:52] <mawk> but yeah I guess
[17:33:10] <micrex22> [itchyjunk]: depends on how zealous they are regarding JAVA :p

[17:33:31] <[itchyjunk]> if it's a belief system wish it away!
[17:33:36] <micrex22> [itchyjunk]: there are a LOT of opinions when it comes to programming.

[17:34:14] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: the best description of the current western practices in dealing with psychosis that I have heard is: When someone is starting to vomit, spiritually, they give you a dirty sock to block the mouth with and solve the problem.

[17:34:58] <[itchyjunk]> edgar-rft, i believe you're god too
[17:35:18] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, do you believe that computers actually exist?
[17:35:23] <[itchyjunk]> it's just a belief system, bro
[17:35:25] <[itchyjunk]> no such thing.
[17:35:32] <mrig> mawk: I am very aware of how difficult the experience can be, but think that we must keep an open mind in our approach to dealing with it, labeling things as disease and stigmatising them arguable is the catalyst that make it so.
[17:35:33] <edgar-rft> will this evolve into a believe system now?
[17:35:38] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: actually as far as I am concerned nothing maybe real
[17:35:44] <[itchyjunk]> edgar-rft, if you do some drugs as well
[17:35:52] <pulse> *Morpheus: "he's beginning to understand"*
[17:35:54] <[itchyjunk]> pyzozord, yes that's a fine "belief system" for yourself
[17:35:58] <pyzozord> philosophy is a fun subject
[17:36:04] <mrig> edgar-rft: I believe in you, and your one liner philosophy!
[17:36:06] <[itchyjunk]> but when you try to dismiss a serious illness because of it.
[17:36:10] <[itchyjunk]> it becomes "not okay"
[17:36:15] <mawk> calling it a disease doesn't automatically mean stigmatizing mrig
[17:36:38] <mawk> you have to recognize that they are not normal human beings, they're not just different as in a height or eye color difference
[17:36:52] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: he did not dismiss anything, he just signaled that not all people we call crazy (in whatever fancy terms we chose) actaully are that
[17:36:55] <[itchyjunk]> he did.
[17:36:58] <edgar-rft> I'm insane and I'm proud of it!
[17:37:03] <[itchyjunk]> you're just desperately trying to justify it.
[17:37:10] <mrig> mawk: oh but language is a very powerful thing, the deeper meanings and implications so very quickly dissipate into the common collective mind as things other than that which is intended.
[17:37:10] <[itchyjunk]> same way you did when i was talking about type theory.
[17:37:11] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: his words were supportive, not dismissve. You can't see that though
[17:37:20] <[itchyjunk]> even without knowing much on the topic, you have strong opinions.

[17:38:35] <mawk> then there's an education problem of the general public mrig
[17:38:37] <bjs> norskalm: what do you mean "access globals",  and in general there is no concept of objects having a unique "parent"
[17:38:37] <norskalm> Every object has a __dict__ variable containing all the variables

[17:40:03] <bjs> norskalm: globals() returns the dict of that module's global variables,  and as I say, there is no concept of a "parent" object.  when you create an object you can pass yourself (the "parent") to it

[22:17:41] <bayaz> Title: [BCLOUD-21356] Add a "Changes done" button in the Pull Request page - Create and track feature requests for Atlassian products. 
[22:18:37] <wedr> wtf... It's basically a broken feature. If this ticket is marked as "Wont fix", no one else is going to be able to report this bug, and then they would close the issue as "duplicate" because there's a closed ticket prior.

[22:22:08] <wedr> Just wanted to criticize that stupid workflow they're using. I understand that it benefits them by simplifying their focuses towards bugs/features other users want more, but that would cause them to have bugs littered everywhere in their services. Minor bugs like these would add up.
