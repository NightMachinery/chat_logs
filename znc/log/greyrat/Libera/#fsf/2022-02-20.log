[08:22:04] <isf> that mean you dont have the 4 freedom in linux completly
[08:22:10] <isf> that mean isnt free software 
[08:22:11] <tpefreedom> AwesomeAdam54321, it's mostly free but not 1000% free

[08:33:18] <clever> isf: is the problem because the hw can run both free and non-free firmware?

[08:33:52] <isf> the hardware cant be terms in free software terms of freedom

[08:37:27] <isf> i only care about free software
[08:37:49] <clever> yeah, and the rpi can become a home of free software, via the firmware i'm working on
[08:38:06] <clever> where you can control every single byte of code running on the cpu, if you ignore the maskrom
[08:38:28] <AwesomeAdam54321> clever: What's the size of the maskrom?
[08:38:57] <clever> AwesomeAdam54321: 18384 bytes on the pi2
[08:39:20] <clever> 14480 bytes on the pi4
[08:39:48] <clever> 30528 bytes on the pi3, because it has usb-host and tftp drivers
[08:40:56] <clever> pi4's rom is the dumbest of them all, but pi0/pi1/pi2/pi4 are all limited to booting from very short-range media, nand/spi/sd/usb-device-mode
[08:41:27] <clever> pi3 i feel is the biggest risk, because it can potentially boot over ethernet if the SD card fails
[08:43:03] <clever> pi1 and pi2 use nearly identical roms, the only difference is fixing a security flaw, and a slight change to nand flash timings
[08:44:15] <clever> for all models, the rom's only job is to load a .bin file into the L2 cache and execute it
[08:47:17] <clever> the rom can be dumped pretty easily, and can be decompiled in ghidra, and with practice, you can tell exactly what its capable of doing and under what conditions

[09:19:59] <clever> i believe its in the metal layer
[09:20:13] <damo22> thats pretty RO
[09:20:24] <clever> the bcm2711B0 was the first 2711 released into the public, and the bcm2711B1 later came out with a new maskrom
[09:20:36] <clever> they added RSA signature support to the rom
[09:20:55] <damo22> hmm
[09:21:06] <clever> the letter (B) refers to the gate mask set, while the number (0/1) refers to the metal layer masks
[09:21:23] <clever> so you can save costs and only change the wires between the gates

[09:21:39] <damo22> i hate these crypto locked roms
[09:21:52] <clever> in this case, the RSA signatures are not enabled by default
[09:21:58] <clever> and they even documented how to enable them
[09:22:33] <damo22> if you cant set your own keypair i would say it can prevent freedom 0
[09:22:36] <clever> however, the much weaker hmac-sha1 signature is enabled by default on the whole 2711 line (and i have dumped its keys, so its providing zero security)
[09:22:54] <clever> you can and you cant, for both algos
[09:23:21] <damo22> if its a symmetric key and you have the key it might be ok
[09:23:21] <clever> for hmac-sha1, the true key is an xor between a maskrom constant, and an OTP (write once) constant
[09:23:43] <clever> but, the OTP is written at the factory currently, you would have to convince them to sell an un-burnt soc
[09:24:24] <clever> for the RSA signatures, i think the stage-1 public key is in maskrom (havent dumped&decompiled that rom yet)
[09:24:46] <clever> and the official stage-1 blob, will then take a user-supplied public key from the SPI flash, and use that to validate everything else
[09:25:03] <clever> the hash of the user-supplied pubkey, can then be burned into the OTP
[09:25:20] <clever> so the soc and official blob, will only ever accept your pubkey and no other
[09:25:27] <damo22> i dont want keys burnt anywhere
[09:25:40] <clever> but, you are relying on the officialy signed blob following those rules forever into the future
[09:25:53] <damo22> they ought to be replaceable with a toggle switch
[09:26:03] <clever> you can choose to not burn the pubkey hash, but then an attacker can just erase the SPI flash to remove that restriction
[09:26:17] <clever> and yeah, you can put a switch on the write-protect line
[09:26:50] <damo22> or a jumper
[09:27:34] <clever> yep
[09:28:34] <clever> if you dont want to burn anything, then you will be stuck in hmac-sha1 mode, and using extracted keys, and the write-protect is the only thing enforcing your firmware of choice remaining in-place
[09:28:44] <damo22> im pretty sure google's chromebooks have a toggle switch to unlock their firmware
[09:28:58] <damo22> so you can write your own keys in there
[09:29:27] <clever> for the 2711, there is no way to have a toggle between broadcoms keys and no keys
[09:29:42] <clever> the toggle can only write-protect the spi with firmware
[09:30:08] <clever> but i feel like chromebooks want a toggle between google's keys and no keys, so you can be sure it has returned to a OEM approved configuration
[09:30:40] <damo22> i think they detect if the firmware has changed with a TPM and alert you on the screen if its not an OEM config
[09:31:15] <clever> but if the firmware has changed, cant i just patch that out?
[09:31:24] <damo22> but im not sure how it all works
[09:31:57] <damo22> you should ask on #coreboot
[09:32:19] <clever> oh yeah, i heard that newer chromebooks have coreboot from the factory
[09:32:42] <damo22> indeed they are shipping coreboot on their factory configurations
[09:33:12] <damo22> but they are locked down with depthcharge
[09:33:48] <damo22> except i heard with physical access to the board you can unlock it by turning a screw or something
[09:33:53] <clever> > Coreboot payload for booting the system super fast
[09:34:27] <clever> my thermostats do have screw based configs, super cheap option
[09:34:52] <clever> instead of having a proper switch, you just have a screw that shorts something out when fully tightened
[09:35:03] <damo22> yep
[09:35:29] <clever> and they still have a proper switch for the electric vs fuel, lol
[09:35:58] <damo22> thats a fancy laptop

[09:36:54] <clever> lol
[09:37:20] <clever> the 2711 firmware has also recently undergone some evolution, that changes things
[09:37:47] <clever> for example, some coreboot setups had a dram init blob prepended onto it for a time
[09:38:01] <clever> and that is now a plausible solution for the 2711 firmware
[09:38:17] <damo22> yes the chromebooks still use FSP blob
[09:38:37] <damo22> coreboot is like a blob wrapper
[09:38:44] <clever> the latest changes to the 2711 firmware, added a network install option, where it boots a fat32 .img file over https
[09:38:58] <damo22> ugh
[09:39:15] <clever> but, the https code for that, pushed them over the 128kb L2 enforced size limit
[09:39:19] *** Joins: cb400f (~cb400f@85.24.34.93.generic-hostname.arrownet.dk)
[09:39:22] <clever> so they had to split the bootloader firmware in half
[09:39:30] <clever> a dram init half, and a everything else half
[09:39:44] <damo22> this is crazy
[09:39:47] <clever> i can now replace that "everything else" chunk
[09:39:57] <clever> and they have supplied a nicely packaged dram-only blob
[09:40:04] <damo22> ok
[09:40:25] <clever> so while the new feature is a negative for some, the way they implemented it, makes a dram init blob far simpler
[09:40:29] <damo22> you have been busy
[09:40:59] <clever> i dont even have to extract the dram-init from the blobs
[09:41:08] <damo22> i gave up on firmware
[09:41:15] <clever> its already its own dedicated and self-contained blob
[09:41:36] <damo22> i work on OS instead
[09:42:23] <damo22> trying to get hurd to boot on some more modern hw
[09:43:34] <clever> the biggest issue i can see in the future of 2711 firmware, is that i still dont have a way to boot the arm core
[09:43:48] <clever> i wasnt focusing on solving that much, because the dram problem was a major roadblock
[09:44:03] <damo22> ok
[09:44:15] <damo22> the vpu boots first right?
[09:44:19] <clever> yep
[09:44:28] <clever> but this new stage1 blob is far dumber, making it a more acceptable blob, compared to the old ones

[09:47:07] <clever> the official recovery.bin is a blob for re-flashing the SPI, to un-brick things, its not capable of loading other stages, so its basically a dead-end single-job binary
[09:47:33] <damo22> and stage-1 bootcode cannot be replaced?
[09:47:35] <clever> i can also create custom recovery.bin's from open source, but without dram drivers, its still a dead-end single-job binary, with a limit of 128kb of L2 cache
[09:47:56] <clever> stage-1 can be replaced, but without dram init, your replacement must operate with only 128kb of cache
[09:48:15] <clever> thats what the green stage-1 is doing
[09:48:39] <damo22> what is your goal
[09:48:49] <clever> replacing stage 1.5 and stage2
[09:49:33] <clever> with the latest firmware, the https support made the closed bootcode.bin stage1 too big, so the RPF devs cut it into a stage-1 and stage-1.5
[09:49:52] <damo22> ok cool
[09:49:52] <clever> but stage-1.5 is just a .elf file (identical format to stage2) held in SPI flash
[09:50:01] <damo22> that sounds promising
[09:50:21] <clever> so i can just take my existing start4.elf code, burn it into the SPI flash, and its now a stage-1.5
[09:51:08] <clever> but, to load a stage2 .elf, i then need drivers for whatever media i want to boot from
[09:51:17] <clever> such as an SD card
[09:51:26] <clever> and the 2711 changed up the SD bus, to make it run at double the speed
[09:51:46] <clever> so i need different (sdhci, an open?/available spec) drivers from what i already have
[09:52:02] <damo22> ok
[09:52:38] <clever> with my current code, i can boot a pi2 to a graphical interface, and a pi3 to a non-graphical interface, both with usb-host
