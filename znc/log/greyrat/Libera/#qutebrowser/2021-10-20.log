[09:10:01] <The-Compiler> bdju: I added a comment to https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/521 - I suppose a script would work indeed, though I'd really recommend using a proper HTML parser. Perhaps something like this with pyperclip and beautifulsoup4:
[09:10:07] <The-Compiler> bdju: pyperclip.copy(bs4.BeautifulSoup(os.environ['QUTE_SELECTED_HTML']).img['alt'])
[09:12:19] <The-Compiler> staceee: there isn't really much qutebrowser does about screen sharing, it's all in the underlying QtWebEngine/Chromium. Any chance you could try with Chromium and/or another QtWebEngine based browser such as KDE Falkon?
[09:12:29] <The-Compiler> amosbird: what would download-copy-and-open do?
[09:12:39] <The-Compiler> winny: what's a "drm build" exactly?
[09:15:39] <The-Compiler> sudoforge: qutebrowser doesn't do anything DNS related, that's coming from Chromium's network stack. Maybe you can pass --host-resolver-rules via qt.args/--qt-flag: https://datacadamia.com/chrome#dns_resolver - let me know if it works, perhaps this would be something worthy to expose via a qutebrowser setting somehow.

[12:21:09] <ninewise> been having this issue for a while, could anyone check if it's just me...
[12:21:30] <ninewise> when opening the web inspector, my cursor becomes this weird vague circle
[12:21:52] <ninewise> and the webinspector has an additional window which shows a view op the page
[12:22:15] <ninewise> (I wouldn't mind turning the thing off, but I'm not seeing a setting for it)
[12:22:32] <ninewise> now problem is, after closing the webinspector, the weird cursor is still there
[12:31:34] <toofar> there should be a blue highlighted button at the top left of the normal pane of the web inspector
[12:31:44] <toofar> like a phone on top of a tablet
[12:32:30] <toofar> it got enabled by default in some release (5.15?)

[16:15:18] <haligh> since i couldnt solve my crashes, i switched to a qutebrowser flatpak. for some reason the inspector is qute different here. when i want to inspect specific elements, there is an extra representation of the html elements.
[16:15:28] <haligh> is that soem kind of a mod that i can turn off?
[16:15:43] <haligh> i prefer to inspect in my original html

[16:17:30] <ninewise> this is funny because I asked this morning
[16:17:36] <ninewise> it's the mobile phone view
[16:18:02] <ninewise> you can turn it off via a small blue phone-icon in the topleft of the inspector (not the additional view)
[16:21:47] <pr-asadi> ninewise: You have answered to me?
[16:22:11] <pr-asadi> If yes, in FreeBSD we do not have Flatpak.
[16:22:25] <ninewise> to haligh, whom was asking a question *just* before I answered
[16:22:40] <ThinkT510> doesn't flatpak rely on linux specific features?
