[00:47:46] <bugweiser> epony, i'm sorry, I merely pointed out (with a good link for reference) that the 'licence = contract' isn't that simple in real life (especially in the judge's opinion, and thats all that really matters in a law-state :) ).
[00:48:03] <bugweiser> I did not change your words to my knowledge.
[00:49:30] <isf> license isnt a contract
[00:49:38] <isf> license is a concent
[00:50:18] <bugweiser> neither do we agree on what we want it to be actually. GNU GPL for example deems itself as not a contract atually, but us judge and french judge have ruled differently!

[00:50:52] <isf> when you accept a nonfree license, you accept a consent for lose the control of your computing.

[01:16:50] <bugweiser> sadly the latter is entirely true.
[01:17:00] <epony> so the regulator part is missing from goverment and legislative side towards businesses, and it's a serious problem because businesses fund and control the government in reality
[01:17:56] <bugweiser> IP litegations however there are pretty common in the grand scheme.
[01:18:11] <epony> so the major law cases are between big businesses and with government changing businesses towards more businesses, not towards more public interests

[01:22:02] <bugweiser> yeah, I agree there
[01:22:06] <epony> the commercial vendors are consumers of technical and technological publications and just commercialise that

[01:26:11] <epony> so real capital is self-hosting software that provides independent small groups back the tools to self-sustain their computing on own premises with free software and affordable ubiquitous standards supporting open architecture hardware (offsetting and disposing off lock-ins and dependencies as much as possible)
