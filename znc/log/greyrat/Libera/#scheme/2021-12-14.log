[00:20:43] <amazigh> justinethier: no, I solved that, the problem is that the tests crash during compilation 
[00:21:10] <amazigh> that is the only missing scheme from this batch :)
[00:21:36] <amazigh> justinethier: I can provide you a gdb stacktrace

[00:46:34] <amazigh> justinethier: regarding cyclone library location, actually, I was wayyy off. I just needed to use cond-expand
[00:46:48] <amazigh> rudybot: do not listen to random stranger
[00:46:58] <rudybot> amazigh: that part is even stranger; he thinks that anyone who cares about the GPL would listen to someone who works for Oracle
[00:47:31] <amazigh> I always remember the Oracle senior manager saying "dynamic is slow" at fosdem 2020
[00:47:44] <amazigh> or was it 2019? 
[00:48:16] <justinethier> amazigh: OK, if you can repro just send me details and I will take a closer look on my end...
[00:50:13] <amazigh> justinethier: email or issues?
[00:51:34] <justinethier> amazigh: Prefer issues but either one works
[01:00:06] <amazigh> justinethier: here is an issue https://github.com/justinethier/cyclone/issues/484, thanks for chiming in :)
[01:05:20] <amazigh> with slklos and cyclone it will make 14 scheme running a subset of srfi-180
[01:06:09] <amazigh> I can't believe we did it. I guess that is why I feel tired :p

[01:11:52] <amazigh> the interface is not good enough
[01:12:27] <amazigh> srfi-168 is worldwide unique and very useful, I am working on a v2
[01:12:50] <amazigh> along okvs v2; but I will not submit it to SRFI this time
[01:13:16] <amazigh> I will try to gather more feedback on it, but it will take time

[15:38:57] <dpk> jcowan: since i've now contributed apparently-useless implementations of it to two different Scheme implementations, could you explain why SRFI 124's reference-barrier is needed in the general case?
[15:39:27] <dpk> the example usage in the SRFI document seems intuitively wrong, at least
[15:39:43] <dpk> https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-124/srfi-124.html#reference-barrier
[15:40:33] <dpk> since there is a strong reference to the ephemeron's key on the stack when reference-barrier is called (the variable k), surely it won't be broken anyway at least until ephemeron-ref returns?
[15:41:46] <dpk> or is binding a variable to the result of ephemeron-key somehow meant to make that variable binding itself a weak reference?
[15:42:51] <dpk> also, since the return value of reference-barrier is unspecified, the example given won't work if the return value happens to be #f
[15:43:05] <dpk> although admittedly it's implied by the example that reference-barrier should not return #f

[16:41:25] <dpk> sham1: "Ephemerons, unlike simple weak pairs, allow the correct handling of data structures in which the value points to the key. For example, a record may have a single field holding the key; if it's desired to use these records as values in a weak hash table using this internal key, ephemerons are necessary or the table will not really be weak."

[16:41:53] <sham1> I see
[16:43:05] <sham1> So a weak pair but it allows for the datum to reference the key and still consider it to not have strong references if the only strong references are from under the ephemeron. That's an interesting idea indeed

[19:59:22] <mdhughes> _foo_ used to be underscore in a lot of highlighting systems, like strn. But Gruber doesn't believe in underscores except in links, so he used it for italic.
[20:00:19] <sham1> You could escape them

[20:12:23] <amazigh> or use the html extension
[20:13:06] <amazigh> I read commonmark support fenced code block such as ```scheme extensions...\n
[20:13:15] <amazigh> where `extensions...` may be whatever
[20:13:48] <amazigh> as long there is no line breaks, it can be used to pass options to the underlying typesetter
[20:14:33] <amazigh> I sort of like markdown, except the absence of /foo/ and _bar_
[20:14:56] <amazigh> but the greatest advantage is emacs' polymode
[20:15:16] <amazigh> that will highlight the fenced blocks according to the choosen language
[20:15:31] <amazigh> it is like a minimode for markdown fenced code blocks
[20:15:54] <amazigh> that is old news for org-mode, but a great discovery for me.
[20:16:32] <amazigh> except guile-commonmark, is there a markdown parser written in Scheme? I will look at chicken eggs.

[21:49:24] <sonny> Would I use find from srfi/1 for a memebershipt test?
[21:51:19] <Zipheir> What's wrong with memv/member ?
[21:51:35] <Zipheir> For lists, I assume.
[21:52:55] <sonny> member returns a sublist, which I don't need
[21:53:02] <Zipheir> What do you need?
[21:53:14] <sonny> I just want to check if a value is in a list, so #t or #f
[21:53:22] <Zipheir> A sublist is truthy.
[21:53:41] <sonny> ok
[21:53:52] <sonny> is there any difference for me then?
[21:54:04] <Zipheir> If you want a boolean, you can "erase the evidence": (if (pair? (member x lis)) #t #f)
[21:54:52] <Zipheir> Idiomatic Scheme rarely uses #t, I'd say.  In a dynamically-typed language, it's more useful to return a value than #t, if there's one that makes sense.
[21:55:29] <Zipheir> Obviously, #t is the only truthy value that makes sense for most predicates.
