[00:06:33] <NetMatic4> does this channel run daily obfuscated question contests?
[00:07:01] <user51> akronymus[m]: yeah, i was away for a while
[00:08:32] <NetMatic4> you guys think the clippy AI ever comes in here to sharpen it's algorithms?
[00:08:40] <user51> you could reverse the bitstring to get the other permutation
[00:08:55] <akronymus[m]> What about duplicate characters?
[00:09:13] <akronymus[m]> And capitalization
[00:09:28] <user51> not the same set :P
[00:09:31] <akronymus[m]> And does there need to be a specific order to the permutations?
[00:10:12] <user51> no, just a permutation of 2 letters from "abcd" without duplicate letters
[00:10:21] <NetMatic4> if it's ascii case checking is as simple as bitwise or on the sixth bit
[00:10:35] <akronymus[m]> Bitvector, 24 bits long
[00:10:41] <NetMatic4> if unicode, RIP
[00:10:50] <akronymus[m]> Oh right 
[00:10:57] <akronymus[m]> Forgot about possibly being unicode
[00:10:58] <user51> wait, 24 bits fjust for "abcd"?
[00:11:06] <akronymus[m]> Naw, for the whole alphabet
[00:11:28] <user51> not 26?
[00:11:31] <akronymus[m]> Then scan the string in to set the bit to corresponding letters to high
[00:11:34] <akronymus[m]> Oh.
[00:11:36] <akronymus[m]> Yeah

[00:12:08] <user51> you can do echo {a..z} | wc -w
[00:12:12] <akronymus[m]> And then you can just scan to first 1 and get all combinations with other 1's
[00:12:26] <akronymus[m]> And then scan to the second one.

[00:12:46] <akronymus[m]> Would be O(n^2) with a upper bound of 26^2
[00:12:59] <akronymus[m]> Assuming all letters exist at least once.
[00:13:32] <user51> hm, could it be divided by 2?
[00:13:48] <akronymus[m]> Oh right
[00:13:58] <akronymus[m]> That is assuming that it always uses the whole range.
[00:14:15] <akronymus[m]> But you only need to scan the range starting from where the first letter is for the second one.
[00:14:17] <user51> i figure the bitscring scales, so if you do it for 13, just shift the bitstring
[00:14:23] <akronymus[m]> Dunno if I make it clear
[00:14:36] <user51> nah i just wanted to make sure i understand it properly
[00:14:51] <akronymus[m]> I am currently talking about generating the pairs.
[00:17:20] <akronymus[m]> `for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++){if (vector[i]) {for (int j = i; j<26; j++) {listOfPairs.add(new char[]{alphabet[i], alphabet[j]}); } }`
[00:17:31] <akronymus[m]> Oh forgot a }
[00:17:40] <akronymus[m]> But you get the idea, right?
[00:17:50] <akronymus[m]> (Could be further optimized.
[00:17:53] <akronymus[m]> )
[00:17:55] <user51> i haven't got that far, but my guess is to make a list of every power of 2 from 0 to 13, and loop over with shifts
[00:18:31] <user51> then you could use the power to index to the "a..z" string
[00:19:10] <akronymus[m]> For setting the bitvector I'd use:

[11:37:13] <vysn> do you guys prefer dark or light mode? is one better than other eye health wise?
[11:37:28] <vysn> than the other
[11:37:58] <jtgd> you got me stumped. I'd love to know if you ever figure it out.
[11:38:17] <no_gravity> I did! ^hello((?: (?!world)[a-z]+)*)
[11:38:25] <no_gravity> Well, someone in #regex did.
[11:39:37] <jtgd> Dark mode. Bright white I have to squint. But a big reason is I have floaters. Easy to see on the white background but on dark background, virtually gone.
[11:40:18] <jtgd> nice going no_gravity. I'm not the regex whiz I thought I was
[11:40:36] <no_gravity> I have the feeling there is a leaner solution though.

[11:42:02] <vysn> from what I have gathered so far dark mode means your pupils have to dilate more to let in more light. 
[11:42:38] <vysn> at the same time you are staring at bright lit text which might be bad for you

[11:48:15] <jtgd> well you can dim the text however you want. I do not advise black bg and full white fg. Dim to a gray that is easy to read and easy on the eyes.

[13:14:04] <DPA> Worst thing is when text is gray, so I get not bright enough for grey on black pages, turn brightness up, but when switching to a non dark tab / site, the overbright white Background burns into my eyes, so I have o turn it back down. Seriousely, if I want a grey mess, I turn down monitor saturation.
[13:14:04] <DPA> Also, is it just me, or is it way too easy to miss when the monitor is a little bit too bright, and do most monitors just not have a dark enough setting for working in the dark?

[13:32:17] <DPA> The thing dealing with loading a dynamic executable is the dynamic loader, ld.so. It also deals wit resolving libs, makes use of the rpath, etc. DT_RPATH is a field in elf binaries for storing the rpath, I think. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html

[13:33:54] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Something that's really cool is that on macOS, they not only have RPATH, but you can also use things like EXECUTABLE_PATH and such when linking with libs.
[13:33:55] <pyzozord> vdamewood: oh I see so these two are because of the gnu feature LD_LIBRARY_PATH right?

[13:35:28] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Well, DT_RPATH exists because someone wanted to be able to embed locations to libraries into the library. DT_RUNPATH exists because someone wanted to be able to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to override search locations like normal.

[13:39:04] <pyzozord> vdamewood: got it
[13:39:10] <vdamewood> The process that goes from .o files to a .a file is called 'archiving'.
[13:39:17] <vdamewood> (That is, building static libs.)
[13:39:33] <audio> vdamewood, any opinion?
[13:39:38] *** Quits: sedeki (~textual@user/sedeki) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[13:39:55] <pyzozord> .a is very interesting. It seems like that's just a different .zip or .xz, but that seems to be part of the executable binary on linux
[13:39:57] <vdamewood> The reason for this, is because .a files are just a simple archive format, like .zip or .tar, but with some metadata for searching for symbols in the enclosed .o files.
[13:40:11] <smallville7123> is handling MATCH_PARENT and WRAP_CONTENT in onLayout instead of onMeasure the wrong way to layout the view?
[13:40:11] <smallville7123> eg if my custom viewgroup calls child.onLayout(true, 0, 0, 50, 50); and my custom viewgroup has a size of 100, 100
[13:40:11] <smallville7123> and my custom view uses it's layout paramater's layout width and height
[13:40:26] <vdamewood> audio: Nope. I have no opinion regarding your situation.
[13:41:10] <vdamewood> pyzozord: When you build a binary using a .a library, it's as if you pulled out the .o files you needed and built with them like they were in your build tree.
[13:41:26] <smallville7123> Valware: yup
[13:41:31] <smallville7123> vdamewood: *
[13:41:57] <pyzozord> audio: depending on the complexity of your spa, using jquery might prove messy, unless you go with some framework on top like backbone. But at that point you might as well use a modern framework anyway
[13:42:23] <vdamewood> pyzozord: So, if foo.a has x.o, y.o, and z.o. And you have gcc -o myprog myprog.o -lfoo, and myprog.o uses a symbol from y.o, it would be the same as gcc -o myprog myprog.o y.o
[13:42:27] <audio> pyzozord, in what ways would it be messy?
[13:43:00] <pyzozord> vdamewood: sorry, just a sec here
[13:43:12] <DPA> Compiling is any kind of transforming code from one form to another, often adding or removing information in the process.
[13:43:29] <pyzozord> audio: jquery was built with mind for small scripts not spas, it doesn't have the bigger structure
[13:43:44] <smallville7123> eg if LinearLayout calls child.onLayout(...); and LinearLayout has a size of 100, 100, and my custom view uses it's layout paramater's layout width and height  *
[13:43:51] <pyzozord> audio: for bigger more complex applications you need more structure or you'll drown in spaghetti
[13:43:57] <pyzozord> audio: let me know if this answeres your question
[13:44:04] <audio> pyzozord, it does, thanks
[13:44:05] <audio> fuck
[13:44:10] <audio> i have to learn a framework
[13:45:15] <DPA> The default behaviour of symbol resolution in .a files is different then for specifying the .o files directly. See the --whole-archive and --no-whole-archive linker options.
[13:46:15] <vdamewood> audio: Good luck.
[13:46:17] <pyzozord> there are many frameworks in js, try to find one that suits your project. Angular is more complex but has everything in it. React is more simple, but it's more like a make-your-own-framework bufet. There are others. Backbone is one of the first js frameworks, it's simple and barebone, and is usually paired with jquery

[13:48:16] <pyzozord> vdamewood: so I think I have the notions of a linker and a loader confused. I think the lodaer is the thing that must convert symbols to actual memory addresses. But then I don't really so what does linker really have to do
[13:48:22] <vdamewood> Funny thing is, the format used for .a on Linux was designed to be ASCII-compatible, so that if you had an archive of ASCII text files, the resulting archive would itself be an ASCII text file.
[13:49:01] <vdamewood> pyzozord: the loader copies the executables and shared object files into memory, the linker does the finding of memory addresses.
[13:49:16] <audio> pyzozord, i learned a little bit of vue
[13:50:35] <pyzozord> vdamewood: so there is a part of linker that executes in runtime?
[13:51:06] <vdamewood> pyzozordd: The thing about executables and shared objects is that they aren't loaded into a single contiguous section of memory. (Or are loaded into a single contiguous section of physical memory, which is then mapped non-contiguous parts of virtual memory in the process's memory space.)

[14:50:55] <jokoon> is it possible to authenticate the date of a picture through EXIF?
[14:51:00] <jokoon> I don't know where to ask this
[14:51:09] <dodo> jokoon: no, you can modify exif data
[14:51:14] <jokoon> EXIF tags can be modified
[14:51:31] <jokoon> but is there some sort of signature or something like that?
[14:51:46] <dodo> then you'd have to trust the signer anyway
[14:51:53] <jokoon> something like the hash of the pic and the exif data
[14:51:58] <dodo> depends on your definition of "authenticate" i guess..
[14:52:03] <user51> vdamewood: yep
[14:52:15] <smallville7123> ANY date can be modified (even filesystem file dates if you know how to manipulate the filesystem)
[14:52:27] <jokoon> ok

[14:53:03] <dodo> jokoon: which problem are you actually trying to solve?
[14:53:06] <jokoon> so for example, if camera manufacturer had some sort of way to sign picture, it would make it possible, right?
[14:53:20] <smallville7123> ANY date can be modified (even filesystem file dates if you know how to manipulate the filesystem itself, such as EXT4's internal filesystem structures and such that hold info for each file)   *

[14:53:42] <vdamewood> user51: The flaw is that it' a little dated, and it doesn't cover macOS. It covers an old IBM system, Linux, and Windows. It was also written at a time when (nearly) all systems were 32-bit, so it doesn't really cover modern 64-bit systems. It's not too hard to find the additional information elsewhere, though.
[14:54:02] <dodo> jokoon: are you trying to guarantee that a picture was created at a specific time, or after a specific time?

[17:31:33] <smallville7123> yes
[17:31:45] <smallville7123> eg weight 1, weight 4, weight 2
[17:31:53] <smallville7123> assuming 3 views
[17:32:14] <mercenary> Each unit gets Wn * 1/sum(W1, W2, ... Wn)
[17:32:16] <vdamewood> Each weight is a number of 'shares' of space. divide by the number of shares, then multiply by the weight.
[17:32:40] <vdamewood> so 1 + 4 + 2 is 7. 1 --> 1/7, 4--> 4/7, 2--> 2/7.
[17:32:46] <[itchyjunk]> Java question, i want to use a `double` but i want it to only save 2 significant figures
[17:33:02] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: Decimal figures?
[17:33:02] <[itchyjunk]> this should be relatively easy.. but floor and such won't work because i don't want double

[17:33:24] <vdamewood> Yeah, doubles don't do  that.

[17:33:39] <smallville7123> so for example
[17:33:48] <[itchyjunk]> @_@
[17:34:04] <vdamewood> So, doubles can only hold .25, .50, and .75 precisely.
[17:34:27] <mercenary> [itchyjunk]: the old method was int(n*100)/100

[18:04:01] <Rounin> Freenode got a bit weird when everyone's accounts were deleted
[18:04:02] <beaky> edgar-rft: yes the problem now is to define the ring itself
[18:04:12] <beaky> and then once you figure out the ultimate ring specification you can automagically solve it
[18:04:53] <[itchyjunk]> i've heard of solvers but not too fimiliar with them
[18:05:06] <[itchyjunk]> this is where algebriac data structures come in right?
[18:05:12] <[itchyjunk]> maybe sybolic math too?
[18:05:24] <edgar-rft> maybe we should use our ring-muscles for that
[18:05:47] <beaky> yes though not to be confused with 'algebraic data types' as in haskell
[18:06:42] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmm

[18:08:49] <beaky> the idea is to (1) define a language and code the solver as a program to solve formulas in that language, and then (2) leverage reflection / metaprogramming machinery in coq or agda to translate coq algebraic structures (big structs that basically define e.g. a ring) into that language and run solvers

[21:41:17] <InPhase> Carbonated iced tea is sold as a thing.  But it sounds pretty wrong to me.
[21:41:39] <InPhase> Also, carbonation is harmful to bone health unless you intake a lot of calcium to counterbalance it (such as by regular dairy intake).
[21:42:31] <pulse> could you do it with a hot tea though
