[05:17:54] <pj> !t quesker deliverability
[05:17:55] <dig-dug> quesker: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each
[05:17:56] <dig-dug> ESP that you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[05:22:43] <quesker> !fcrdns
[05:22:44] <dig-dug> quesker: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP. This is very important if you want big sites to accept your mail. If you can't have it from your ISP, see !relayhost
[05:22:58] <quesker> yes all that is fine
[05:23:13] <quesker> except dnswl, not on that
[05:23:27] <pj> well then you know what to try next
[05:26:14] <quesker> you run a server that isn't marked as spam?
