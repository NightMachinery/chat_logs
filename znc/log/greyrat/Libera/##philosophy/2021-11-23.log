[08:18:55] <biys> HAHA
[08:19:32] <vaquero> we had a dude jump in a channel on another server, sat there for years and dint say anything and we asked if he was a fed and he left. never came back
[08:19:34] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[08:20:06] <Bakunin> vaquero tons of feds on Libera
[08:20:14] <I_Am_M00t> i've chatted with a lot of weird 4channers on another server
[08:20:18] <I_Am_M00t> they use terms like glowie all the time
[08:20:23] <I_Am_M00t> and shill
[08:20:42] <vaquero> I_Am_M00t:  to be fair prob alot of them on 4chan lol
[08:21:25] <I_Am_M00t> they probably scrap all social media
[08:21:42] <I_Am_M00t> but i doubt they sit there like idiots when there are algorithms to weed out possibly dangerous material
[08:23:45] <Bakunin> lol @ thinking they're interested in stopping dangerous material :)
[08:24:07] <vaquero> i think most feds arent actual feds, like when intelligence companies use hollywood actors. its not so much they are trained to be a secret agent. its more they are asked to push a message or say a thing under the guise of national security and the dipshits are like "yes sir, i am a loyal patriot ready to save the world"
[08:24:37] <I_Am_M00t> so it's a kid pretending to be a fed
[08:24:56] <vaquero> it must be so easy for the CIA to get people to push a message. "obviously i cant give you to much detail as its a matter of national security but trust me your fighting the good fight"
[08:25:31] <Bakunin> thats just the GOP
[08:25:45] <Bakunin> CIA sits at the top of those orgs and directs the money
[08:25:53] <I_Am_M00t> i mean, this is just called misinformation
[08:25:56] <Bakunin> The FBI catfished a suicidally depressed pizza delivery guy. The agent catfishing him repeatedly tried to get him to commit a terrorist attack. He repeatedly talked her out of it. So they arrested him on gun possession.
[08:26:03] <Bakunin> ^ what they reall do online
[08:26:53] <vaquero> Bakunin:  like that "assassination attempt" and then you find out the group of 13 was actually just 1 guy and 12 FBI agents

[19:03:07] * arryana shrugs
[19:03:13] <arryana> what difference does that make?
[19:03:43] <p0indexter> in a simulation you can load a saved state w/o the avatar being aware.
[19:03:57] <arryana> so?
[19:04:14] <p0indexter> consider an experiment called the delayed choice quantum eraser
[19:04:30] <arryana> nah, i'm doing other things right now.

[19:05:25] <p0indexter> paradox
[19:05:49] <p0indexter> anyway its an open question
[19:05:51] <arryana> there's a big leap between 'coming here to be alone' and not having time or inclination to 'consider' a particular thing
[19:06:30] <p0indexter> there may be a difference however its more like a fine line
[19:07:00] <arryana> it really isn't.
