[21:29:11] <nmz1> you using awk in windows?
[21:29:25] <tirnanog> what's wrong with the earlier answer given in #bash?
[21:29:53] <nmz1> if greybeard answered then its unnacceptable
[21:31:51] <tirnanog> there was actually a hopelessly broken awk solution offered, but I countered it with a working bash solution. not that there's anything wrong with asking about awk too; just curious as to the circumstances.
[21:31:56] <useretailz> answer given by gnoo is good, but it doesn't work if path has spaces
[21:32:21] <tirnanog> yes, it was broken.
[21:32:37] <useretailz> second answer is problematic for me because of shopt -s extglob
[21:32:41] <emanuele6> i answered in #sed, but the question has already been asked as a copy paste to #awk and #bash :((
[21:33:26] <tirnanog> sed is comfy in this case, yeah.
[21:33:30] <nmz1> sed solution looks good
[21:33:58] <useretailz> emanuele6, question asked in #bash supposes bash-only solution
