[00:13:00] <ayecee> fitkari3: the drives intended to do this usually have this controlled by a jumper, and are labelled "enterprise" or something.
[00:13:03] <fitkari3> VERY DANGEROUS? then no thanks
[00:13:39] <ayecee> fitkari3: it's unsafe and bad for security if you're running virtual machines for other people. if this is your home computer, then it probably doesn't have much impact.

[02:24:54] <alkisg> Via latex?

[04:07:00] <jaafarrc> I definitely wasn't around at any of those years, but when I was very young, I had a fascination for Linux, just because it was the "third option." I had a rough concept of what a "distro" and a "Ubuntu" were, and I actually wanted a Linux computer. However, I immediately went back on that and asked for a Windows one instead. Fast forward to 2019, and that passion came back, and here I am today. :)
[04:07:07] <rascul> neither was using linux

[04:37:18] <rsjw> given a program that is installed by make && sudo make install, what's a good way to find out the files that it installs, without reading the makefile to try to figure out what it does? this would be to get a list of files to delete when you want to uninstall it
[04:37:32] *** Quits: p0g0_ (~p0g0@user/p0g0) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:37:56] <akk> rsjw: make -n install, tells you everything the make install would do
[04:38:36] <rsjw> but it's often long and hard to read... people put shell script snippets in there, so it's often not straightforward
[04:38:45] <akk> yes, the output can be very long
[04:39:01] <akk> another possibility is make uninstall -- if the program has that, it might be shorter
[04:39:04] *** Joins: jensen (~jensen@65.78.100.184)
[04:39:11] <akk> but it's not guaranteed to be there, or to be correct
[04:39:30] <akk> make -n uninstall, I should say, assuming you don't actually want to uninstall :)
[04:39:33] <rsjw> right, I'm assuming there is no uninstall target, or that it doesn't work right, or that you don't trust it

[04:42:18] <rsjw> would nothing be installed in other directories like /etc or /var?
[04:42:26] <danieldg> nixos basically does that, installing everything to /nix/store/name/
[04:43:03] <danieldg> rsjw: if you package it, then yes

[04:44:40] <jensen> what makes emacs slower as an ide compared to vim (and some would argue in general)? is there an elisp translation layer between the core c stuff and functions bound as keybindings whereas vim actions are implemented directly by the core c stuff? this is probably not even correct. i'm not talking about emacs capable of being used for other things, just as an ide

[04:45:28] <rsjw> ok, then that sounds good. I actually wanted to do something like /usr/local/package-name at first... how would all the different packages see each other? is it as simple as adding a bunch of /usr/local/package-name/bin directories to PATH, or are there other things I need to set in addition to that?
[04:45:33] <danieldg> jensen: if emacs is slow, then there's something making it slow (like a syntax coloring ruleset)

[04:46:47] <danieldg> rsjw: usually you would add /opt/foo/bin/ to the PATH, or add symlinks as needed from something in PATH

[04:48:08] <danieldg> rsjw: packages are usually nicer if they do have a bunch of things like manpages, multiple binaries, etc

[07:32:17] <mlu> hashfunc569: there's no need to be logged in or anything: chances are, you just have a laptop-optimized configuration that sleeps or hibernates when you "log out"
[07:32:24] <mlu> ah, suspend will be equivalent to a sleep
[07:32:45] <mlu> just turn off the suspend on logout, etc. and make sure your networking is configured to be permanently on

[13:45:41] <lovetruth> I've read in the bash manual that $EPOCHREALTIME has "special properties" and if unset it loses those properties.
[13:45:56] <jim> it's another name for something that reads lines you type, and tries to make sense of them

[13:47:10] <jim> there are a handful of shells
[13:47:36] <lovetruth> knowing some C - I wonder where in the bash source code I could find more about those "special properties" - to better understand them. Maybe... also to mimic them for other variables?... Maybe creating something like "socket variables" (or some variables like "pipe files" :)) ) ?...

[21:42:12] <ph88^> jiglan, you should review every occurance of username case by case really.  Also if you look for paths just prefix with slash to get less results. I said before search for 'oldusername' so change that into '/oldusername'
[21:42:23] <jiglan> and there is the step #0: backuo :)

[23:06:33] <jim> cornfeedhobo, probably "a nerd about" is not a great way to put that
[23:06:39] <tirnanog> Mocean: because you are requesting deletion, you should create any missing directory ahead of time, as was mentioned. if it were the case that you were not requesting deletion it would be safe to pick the shallowest ancestor directory (even / if necessary), cd into it first then use rsync's -R option. you can't have both unless you want to lose large swathes of data.

[23:08:28] <tirnanog> Mocean: if you are using rsync over ssh to begin with. just run ssh remotehost "mkdir -p -- $(printf %q "$remotedir")" ... if it's bash on both sides.
[23:08:37] <tirnanog> and if that suceeds, carry on.

[23:11:38] <akik> it does for me
[23:13:12] <tirnanog> akik: not when the exact directory specified by the destination operand does not already exist. to make that work, it's as I said. you either use the -R option and arrange for the copy to be between the shallowest, mutually-existing ancestor directories (even up to / if necessary) or ... you create the target directory ahead of time.

[23:13:47] <Mocean> I got it to work just using normal rsync -avp --delete-delay option, I had a mistake in my for loop
[23:13:49] <Mocean> thanks all
[23:13:53] <tirnanog> if you were to rsync -av /foo/bar/baz/ dsthost:/foo/bar/baz/, that would fail unless /foo/bar/baz already existed as a directory at the host.
[23:13:56] <tirnanog> now
[23:14:08] <tirnanog> if deletion were not needed, you could instead do: cd / && rsync -ai foo/bar/baz/ dsthost:/
[23:14:22] <tirnanog> cd / && rsync -aiR foo/bar/baz/ dsthost:/, rather.

[23:41:27] <NeoFAT32> Most of Linux users are so ridiculous. XD What a community. I've seen a guy on a forum who spend a whole forum chatting with an idiot, just to read this last one, says "there's a documentation on nvidia website". Guys, just why answering if you don't help ? This guy could create himself a xorg.conf for this lost guy but no ! He sent him to a doc. XD
