[21:52:02] <MaxLeiter> that live OCR is cool 
[21:52:20] <MaxLeiter> okay thats super cool 
[22:23:02] <bookworm> anything interesting?
[22:28:34] <aab_> yeh loads
[22:33:00] <bookworm> such as? scrolling over random live blog doesn't yoeld anything particularly newsworthy
[22:33:19] <bookworm> are they lagging?
[22:40:49] <aab_> not lagging at all, it's all newsworthy lol it's apple
[22:41:26] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: personal favorite is the image ocr in photos. can select text from whiteboards / signs / whatever 
[22:41:42] <MaxLeiter> also quick notes is cool, but i built it in 2015 so ðŸ¤·
[22:41:54] <MaxLeiter> (although mine looked like crap... https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/1522c44290fd0747/quicknote.jpeg 
[22:42:22] <bookworm> android has widgets since forever for things like that
[22:42:30] <bookworm> which is neat
[22:42:57] <bookworm> OCR sounds nice, though so far I personally didn't need it
[22:43:26] <bookworm> it works poorly anyhow as my native language is a dialect of German no AI understands
[22:44:00] <bookworm> so for me it was basically try the AI with high German, give up due to too much accent and resort to the usual type input
[22:44:24] <bookworm> (or with English for that matter)
[22:44:41] <aab_> you going to be able to build apps on the ipad 
[22:44:59] <aab_> iCloud + now with unlimited cameras for home kit
[22:45:21] <aab_> new privacy features
[22:45:30] <bookworm> and why's that a new thing? Didn't apple have some sprt of IDE app?
[22:45:50] <aab_> dunno
[22:45:59] <aab_> new facetime features
[22:46:15] <aab_> new music sharing and video sharing with friends family
[22:46:34] <aab_> weather app been revamped completely
[22:46:39] <bookworm> I can do that across the OSes with youtube ;P
[22:46:50] <aab_> Spatial Audio for TVOS
[22:47:25] <aab_> put it this way nothing on here is going to change the lounge :P
[22:48:09] <aab_> safari end to end browser encryption 
[22:48:13] <bookworm> they should finally fix PWAs rather than reinvent audio codecs which are already standard over all home cinema systems
[22:48:16] <aab_> via two new endpoints
[22:48:52] <bookworm> end to end what?
[22:49:05] <aab_> encryption
[22:49:12] <bookworm> yeah, but what
[22:49:21] <bookworm> TLS is just the same
[22:49:28] <aab_> dunno
[22:49:28] <bookworm> so what differs?
[22:49:32] <aab_> im not apple
[22:49:34] <aab_> i have no idea
[22:49:49] <aab_> it will come out in depth what they mean later
[22:50:07] <bookworm> mkey
[22:50:34] <aab_> they have mentioned that much I couldn't type it all to you
[22:51:19] <aab_> they have spoke about literally every platform they have
[22:51:36] <bookworm> their private email thing is genius... if they've been leaking if someone opened up an email by default that would be one serious display of incompetence and they market the desired state as a new feature
[22:51:47] <aab_> oh yeh there's that
[22:51:56] <aab_> email privacy random email addresses will be made
[22:52:02] <aab_> and you can delete them whenever you want
[22:52:12] <bookworm> that's not a new feature that's how every fucking MUA under the sun works
[22:52:18] <aab_> settle down
[22:52:20] <aab_> i have no idea
[22:52:26] <aab_> lol
[22:52:52] <aab_> it's for signups I think
[22:53:06] <bookworm> the private address thing is kinda neat, with the usual problems of forwarding, but the not leaking part is nuts
[22:53:12] <bookworm> and not in a good way
[22:53:31] <bookworm> then again, that was me reading the aformentioned live coverage
[22:54:40] <aab_> universal control between devices is coming with sidecar that was launched
[22:55:40] <bookworm> it's just always the same... apple telling people on stage about a absolutely new thing that's never been seen before! Except on every other OS ðŸ™ƒ
[22:56:21] <aab_> ofcourse except it just works lol
[22:56:39] <bookworm> there's that, but only as long as you stay purely in their ecosystem
[22:56:42] <aab_> apple at least streamlines things where possible
[22:56:53] <bookworm> they don't even try to be compatible in any way
[22:56:57] <aab_> all about the eco system
[22:57:13] <aab_> it's all compatible if you stay with their devices
[22:57:22] <aab_> it's when you use other devices in the mix it breaks
[22:57:23] <bookworm> aka vendor lock-in
[22:57:27] <aab_> ofc
[22:58:22] <aab_> Automator is transitioning to shortcuts
[23:04:36] <MaxLeiter> its vendor lock in but its so nice i dont mind 
[23:04:42] <MaxLeiter> maybe one day KDE connect will be good
[23:09:54] <aab_> shhh don't tell that to bookwurm
[23:09:58] <aab_> lol
[23:12:25] <aab_> ahaha xcode github
[23:12:34] <aab_> they bringing xcode cloud lol
[23:13:09] <aab_> that's some serious bloody coding 
[23:13:23] <aab_> automate a run between every device apple owns
[23:23:27] <bookworm> I'm not Apple's target crowed, I like to tinker
[23:23:51] <bookworm> I can see why people just wanna buy a device that integrates well, it just doesn't suit my personal taste
[23:23:59] <bookworm> crowd*

[23:26:30] <aab_> people want what works 
[23:27:09] <aab_> you could never keep a windows device that lasts 7 years and still work the same as it did on day 1, my macbook air did
[23:27:32] <aab_> not so much linux though that may last depends on software
[23:27:54] <aab_> at the end of the day it's a personal preference isn't it
[23:28:04] <aab_> I now have mac, windows and linux devices
[23:29:25] <bookworm> Sure, whatever makes you happy. What I hate is if apple does a keynote and suddenly that's a new thing or invented by apple according to the news or whatever even though it's a thing they copied
[23:29:52] <aab_> I
[23:30:03] <aab_> indeed, but that doesn't just stop at apple
[23:30:06] <bookworm> they had some pretty significant stuff early on, nowdays? Not so much
[23:30:08] <aab_> they all copy features from each other
[23:30:19] <bookworm> sure
[23:30:26] <bookworm> not a bad thing either
[23:30:46] <aab_> wtf I just realised something my windows laptop has side gestures and the lounge just changed channel I have the window in full screen lol
[23:30:50] <aab_> 2 finger swipe
[23:30:54] <aab_> never knew that
[23:31:33] <bookworm> you can configure what the gestures do on at least some trackpads
[23:31:42] <bookworm> it's just mouse input
[23:32:05] <aab_> i can't get it to swipe now not sure what ive done
[23:33:06] <bookworm> three fingers?
[23:33:40] <aab_> that's taking me to new windows
[23:33:46] <aab_> rather than swipe in tlc
[23:34:20] <aab_> can't get it to do it again let me reopen
[23:34:22] <bookworm> next you tell me you still have hotcorners enabled ;P
[23:34:48] <bookworm> that's one heck of an anti feature
[23:34:57] <aab_> anti feature?
[23:35:11] <aab_> nah i don't have hot corners enabled but i think I might now just cos you mentioned it ha
[23:36:04] <aab_> bahaha I can't get swipe chan to work again I have no idea how I did it
[23:36:14] <bookworm> try quickly closing a full screen application when going to the corner activates some unrelated thing
[23:38:33] <aab_> nope nothing ill figure it out ha
[23:40:56] <aab_> got it
[23:41:12] <aab_> change forward / backward on touchpad gesture
