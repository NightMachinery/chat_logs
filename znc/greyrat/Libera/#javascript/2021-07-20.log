I have created a project (like a library), on it im working with kafkajs and pino (logger) as a direct dependencies to this package. In some files i have import * as pino from 'pino'; and import * as createRetry from 'kafkajs/src/retry'. Then in another project i have that packageA as a dependency, when i compile packageB i got: error TS2349: This

[01:56:07] <xochilpili> then, reading about this ts error, i found something about tsconfig "esModuleInterop":true < then i have changed that in tsconfig.json in projectA, but now in projectB i have createRetry is not a function

[01:56:53] <GreenJello> though it's not clear where Pino comes from
[01:56:56] <teut> like this tutorial guy has ton of json files modified which auto configured vscode settings, the theme etc

[04:06:05] <entuland> I was actually about to point out that that piece of code is cryptic to me and could have been made, don't know, easier to read and understand, but it's probably due to the react stuff and my limited experience with that notation

[09:46:17] <szutt> If found in violation of laws, residency may be revoked and he may be deported to his home country.
[09:46:17] <szutt> This becomes even further complicated given another repo of his - Fuck 学习强国, which is highly critical of the Chinese government. Were he deported to China, who knows how he may be received.
[09:46:18] <szutt> While under normal circumstances, he could apply for asylum in order not to be deported, but this option is extremely limited when found in violation of the laws of the country you are a guest in.

[09:52:47] <ljharb> paulcarroty: yes, that is what i'm referring to. it's not a credible threat.
[09:52:55] <Slade> whats the threat? that law will be enforced and it'll be bad for them?
[09:53:23] <ljharb> it is implying that if they *were* to enforce their claim legally, that it would result in the repo author's death or imprisonment

[09:53:34] *** pwnd_sfw6 is now known as pwnd_sfw
[09:53:35] <ljharb> which is an implied threat, but is not actually a credible threat nor is it extortion
[09:53:36] <ljharb> it's just a dick move
[09:54:06] <Slade> thats like saying "if ljharb murders someone i'm going to tell the cops"
[09:54:36] <ljharb> well, it's more like saying "if i call the cops because ljharb murdered someone, he'll probably end up dead because that's what cops do"
[09:54:53] <ljharb> the implied threat is "i will call the cops and thus get you dead, unless you do X". but that's not the same thing as an actual threat.
[09:55:00] <Slade> fair enough
[09:55:50] <ljharb> the trick tho is that some kinds of enforcement - copyright and trademark and patent, mainly - mean that they are *compelled* to take legal action or else they lose their trademark/copyright/patent/etc
[09:56:03] <ljharb> not sure if this one applies, it's too long a thread to read the whole thing

[10:05:53] <ljharb> paulcarroty: i'm not saying it's a good move
[10:05:56] <ljharb> paulcarroty: but it's not a threat
[10:06:26] <ljharb> anyways at this point there'll be a million forks of the repo on the internet the instant the current one disappears
[10:06:50] <theskillwithin> lol I considered cloning it even tho i have no idea what it is
[10:06:53] <ljharb> it'd have been a lot cheaper to just hire him and make him take down the repo that way
[10:09:20] <OnkelTem> How to trace network activity of npm?
[10:09:41] <OnkelTem> I tried --verbose, but I think that it's lying
[10:12:28] <theskillwithin> npm config get registry
[10:12:44] <theskillwithin> idk what u mean
[10:14:51] <theskillwithin> ooo unrelated but neato https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-completion
[10:17:05] <OnkelTem> theskillwithin: I mean that npm acts like there's no a configured registry for a namespace. So when I install something like @streamlabs/package, it looks like NPM goes directly to npmjs, skipping that part when it first tries a private registry
[10:17:20] <ljharb> OnkelTem: what version of npm
[10:17:44] <OnkelTem> 7.20.0, hi ljharb
[10:17:54] <ljharb> and what's `npm config get registry`
[10:17:59] <OnkelTem> I tried both on 6.x and this one
[10:18:17] *** Joins: codebam (~codebam@user/codebam)
[10:18:37] <OnkelTem> it sais: https://registry.npmjs.org/
[10:18:40] <OnkelTem> which is fine, as I configured a registry for a custom scope
[10:18:43] <OnkelTem> @streamlabs
[10:19:09] <OnkelTem> $ npm config ls
[10:19:12] <OnkelTem> @streamlabs:registry = "http://gitlab.our.domain/api/v4/packages/npm/"
[10:20:49] <ljharb> OnkelTem: it's a bug in gitlab
[10:21:02] <ljharb> because gitlab has this dumb project-specific endpoint
[10:22:01] <ljharb> OnkelTem: i do see your npm issue, https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3554, which is where i got that info from
[10:22:37] <OnkelTem> I see, sorry for that. I thought first it was npm issue.
[10:22:47] <ljharb> OnkelTem: given that nobody's reporting issues on verdaccio or artifactory or even github package registry, that suggests pretty strongly it's an issue with gitlab, who's the only one that has project-level registry endpoints
[10:22:59] <ljharb> OnkelTem: but if you want to be sure, you can use a separate program like wireshark or something to monitor traffic
[10:23:43] <OnkelTem> Actually, I was wondering only why NPM doesn't tell anything about connecting to the private repo. Nothing.
[10:23:47] <OnkelTem> registry*
[10:24:26] <OnkelTem> And I don't see this activity even with strace -f
[10:24:31] <ljharb> OnkelTem: try `--loglevel=silly`
[10:27:28] <OnkelTem> ljharb: still nothing (https://dpaste.org/vvZw)
[10:31:02] <OnkelTem> Is https://verdaccio.org/ a good choice for running our private registry?

[18:00:25] <jellobot> sillyslux__, for..in is not to loop through indices/values of an array. Use for(init;cond;step) or Array#forEach. For..in iterates over *all* enumerable properties of an object, without any defined order. See also !iteration

[18:03:29] <entuland> well, anyways, for-in or for-of isn't really the issue at hand - I refer to the (to me) unnecessary destructruring, the long arrow function where a function seems better readable to me, and using a loop instead of getting an array to use reduce() on with that accumulator

[18:04:40] *** Joins: pizdets (~pizdets@183.182.111.100)
[18:04:49] <entuland> what I mean with "long" is that it's not a oneliner, I actually have to focus and match the parens to understand where one thing starts and the other ends
[18:04:59] <entuland> in particular for the object accumulator
[18:05:01] <stenno> oh
[18:05:08] <sillyslux__> destructuring isn't the problem here imo, rather the Object.keys
[18:05:16] <stenno> i'd use Object.entries
[18:05:26] <entuland> yeah, the destructuring was just my own ignorance about the feature

[18:22:51] <sillyslux__> you can easily return a new object ({ nonItems: {description, name }, item_props }) but seems superfluous to me
[18:23:19] <sillyslux__> just destructure where ever you need it
[18:24:23] <ScottMichaud> Hello. A couple days ago I was talking about an intermittent issue (DOMException about showSaveFilePicker not being a result of a user gesture). Turns out Chrome *does* allow showSaveFilePicker (and other user gesture checks) to be associated with an async call. The problem is that they have a timeout, and I was barely hitting it on two of the
[18:24:23] <ScottMichaud> fifty-or-so runs.
[18:24:54] <ScottMichaud> So the solution is just asking for the privileged items early, and doing the slow stuff after.
[18:26:06] *** Joins: gehn (~gehn@user/gehn)

[18:33:31] <ScottMichaud> Seems a bit weird to need to ask for a save file dialog before you download the file that you want (or require the user to make two clicks, one to fetch and one to save) but I guess that's more secure... ... you know, got to save the user from having save file dialog popups occur... as opposed to just creating an anchor element, setting the
[18:33:32] <ScottMichaud> download attribute, and using JavaScript to emulate a click. That's completely fine to do without a user gesture lol.

[18:39:24] <ScottMichaud> Even with a save file dialog? How would you make an image or video editor then???
[18:39:52] <sillyslux__> it's ok if a browser native dialog opens
[18:40:07] <ScottMichaud> That's what I was saying.
[18:40:44] <sillyslux__> but then it's me putting the file somewhere on my computer
[18:40:50] <ScottMichaud> Correct.
[18:41:00] *** Joins: pizdets (~pizdets@183.182.111.100)
[18:41:42] <ScottMichaud> What I was saying is that, to even show that dialog, you need to be 1) called from a function that started from a user gesture event and 2) be within X seconds of that user gesture.
[18:41:56] <ScottMichaud> Otherwise the save file dialog will not open... which is silly because that means you need to ask before you fetch the file.
[18:42:29] <ScottMichaud> (Which is trivial if it's an in-memory blob, like a photo or video)
[18:43:00] <sillyslux__> oic now
[18:43:07] <ScottMichaud> (Not trivial if it's a file generated by a server... you would need to push that file to the client before you ask them to click to save it... which likely means two clicks... a fetch and a save.)

[18:47:13] <ScottMichaud> Awful as in only a clown would do it, and it would end up on a code horror page somewhere.
[18:47:58] <ScottMichaud> So yeah... actually solution is two clicks, one to fetch and one to save, or pop a save file dialog before you actually get the file.
[18:49:59] *** Joins: cajiga (~john@45.146.55.161)
[18:52:48] <entuland> another alternative is just an endpoint or temporary file on the server, so that you can give the user a link they can click / right click and save as or the alike - this approach may not even require any JS - the file itself may not need to be generated at all unless the user actually requests it via that link

[18:56:46] <ScottMichaud> Yes. Also, generating an invisible anchor tag set to download and using JavaScript to click on it also works, although it will go directly to the downloads folder on Chrome. (Firefox will pop a dialog asking if you want to save it or open it by default... or at least by default for me.)

[19:04:58] <ScottMichaud> That's the guy that wrote FileSaver.js
[19:04:59] <entuland> this is and old spec that mentions FileSaver: https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-file-writer-api-20110419/
[19:05:24] <ScottMichaud> It just creates an anchor tag and clicks on it... although I didn't realize that he actually proposed it???
[19:06:05] <entuland> they both date back to 2011, I'm trying to see if there is anything supported now that makes the hidden anchor trick superfluous
[19:06:18] <entuland> I use that trick as well, never bothered checking if there were alternatives
[19:06:24] <systemfault> The closest thing to it would probably be the File and Directory Entries API... https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API
[19:06:39] <systemfault> Not sure it does what you need though.
[19:07:00] <Bombo> i got a problem with querySelector: is it possible to search for the one div that has the data-opus attribute 'foo.opus' when the filename is in a let? let e = document.querySelector("div[data-opus='']");
[19:07:20] <Bombo> let fn = 'foo.opus'; let e = document.querySelector("div[data-opus='']");
[19:07:49] <Bombo> so the fn has to go somehow in between the '' div[data-opus='']
[19:08:00] <Bombo> i mean
[19:08:07] <Bombo> +fn+ ?
[19:08:46] <systemfault> You can do whatever you want with strings, as long as the resulting string is a proper selector, it will work
[19:10:37] <systemfault> Maybe you need to escape the . with a backslash... Not sure if . is a special character in this context...
[19:10:51] <ScottMichaud> entuland It looks like they're hoping https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API is the path forward.

[21:50:12] <entuland> I'd start by checking which events get fired with the various interactions and checking whether you can add a flag about the last click or something, not sure about how bootstrap handles these things
[21:50:27] *** Quits: gggpkm_ (~gggpkm@60.10.194.43) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[21:50:50] <entuland> probably in the hidden.bs.dropdown event you get some param that tells you which element has been clicked
[21:50:55] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@79.120.223.86) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[21:51:08] <entuland> if it matches with the dropdown itself, probably you can cancel the hiding or something

[21:51:23] <entuland> no, the other way around
[21:51:41] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@79.120.223.86)
[21:51:50] <entuland> only cancel it / re-show if the element is _not_ the dropdown itself, if I'm getting you right
[21:52:09] <entuland> if you want more hands on the code to actually fiddle with it, you'd need to provide a working fiddle
[21:52:33] <MaxFury> thanks entuland

[21:54:44] <entuland> stopPropagation() has been suggested in some old SO threads and it _may_ work depending on how you implement the check

[22:33:58] <entuland> it seems to be already working like that

[22:41:34] <MaxFury> entuland, try this https://jsfiddle.net/zeusthepotter/cx895kzf/1/
[22:42:08] <MaxFury> the dropdown probably isn't working for the previous fidde
[22:44:09] <entuland> the dropdown in the second version disappears immediately as you click on any element
[22:44:56] <entuland> so you need to intercept it even before you get to interact with the date picker

[22:58:06] <entuland> I'm confused - the dropdown does _not_ go away on chrome if I click on LOL or on the datepicker
[22:58:38] <entuland> I was messing with the previous version, check the console here: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/rsp79L3z/
[22:58:47] <entuland> I added an ID to the markup
[22:58:53] <entuland> a copypasted helper function
[22:59:18] <entuland> and a delegate click handler that will intercept anything on the page and will tell you whether the click happened inside or outside of that specific branch
[22:59:19] <MaxFury> entuland does it go away when you click on somewhere other than the buttons, for example somewhere in the empty white space on the widget?
[22:59:40] <entuland> yes
[23:00:06] <entuland> try the check I added above, it's at the end of the JS box
[23:00:30] <MaxFury> ok
[23:01:38] <entuland> that's just to tell where the click happened
