[13:47:33] <flip214> swank/clisp.lisp says GPL2 - Most of the others are MIT or Public Domain. How about switching -- at least to LGPL, so that swank can be included in a lisp image?

[14:22:11] <Shinmera> ? The backend for clisp isn't included if swank is loaded on anything but clisp.
[14:22:52] <Shinmera> And clisp is GPL
[15:14:05] <flip214> oh, so you say it makes no difference? I hope so.
[15:16:50] <Shinmera> yes.
[15:43:47] <luis> It's my understanding that we can't change the licensing of a file without permission from each and every author. (Except for the funny upgrade clause in the GPL.) 
[15:52:32] <flip214> luis: well, of course it would be a bit of work. OTOH, this shows only 3 email addresses:   git log --format=%ce ./swank/clisp.lisp
[15:53:51] <flip214> I'm just not sure whether even a non-loaded file (for some configuration) might inflict licensing issues.
[15:54:37] <flip214> though in this case there shouldn't be any "derived works"... OTOH, _one_ source file (the .asd) mentions the GPL file...

[16:35:23] <Shinmera> If the mere act of mentioning GPL software made you GPL everything would be GPL.
[16:35:29] <Shinmera> Programmers' readiness to argue and fret about licenses will never not be a waste of time. Just do your thing.
[16:39:33] <jackdaniel> I agree with that. To play the devil's advocate, I'm sure that Bruno Haible thought the same thing when he bundled readline with clisp ,)

[18:11:02] <flip214> Shinmera: well, I have to be careful... we've got people checking licenses of OSS software (which is a good thing, basically)
[18:11:39] <flip214> and it's not always easy to communicate finer points or intents - especially if there's no written statement
