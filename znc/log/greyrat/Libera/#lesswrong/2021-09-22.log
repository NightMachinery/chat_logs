[00:55:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are not literally zero additional examples in this case but there are definitely not many.
[00:56:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_cut_effect (why is this a stub??) mentions closed captioning ... ok, that's one thing, I guess, what else
[00:56:25] <Robomot> Curb cut effect - Wikipedia (The curb cut effect is the phenomenon of disability-friendly features being used and appreciated by a larger group than the people they were designed for. For example, many hearing people use closed captioning. With wide use, accessibility is a boon to all people. …)
[00:56:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect gives a bunch of examples, almost none of which actually fit the pattern
[00:56:50] <Robomot> The Curb-Cut Effect (Laws and programs designed to benefit vulnerable groups, such as the disabled or people of color, often end up benefiting all of society.)
[00:56:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Once you know what you’re looking for, the curb-cut effect is on display all around. It happened when seat belt legislation, adopted initially to protect young children, led 49 states to adopt seat belt laws that have saved an estimated 317,000 lives—children and adults—since 1975.23 It happened when affirmative action was created to open the doors of higher education to black people—and ended up emboldening vast
[00:56:57] <Obormot\Arcturus>  numbers of white women, and other racial and ethnic groups, to push for greater access as well. It happened when fed-up flight attendants spearheaded a national fight to end smoking on planes, setting in motion a decades-long public-health campaign that has largely banished smoking from public spaces and cut tobacco consumption in half since the 1960s.24"
[00:57:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Affirmative action?? Smoking bans? Come on
[00:57:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those aren't curb cut effects...
[00:57:58] <adiabatic> that's because they're social-justice people and don't know shit about the real world
[00:58:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> The bike lanes example is also extremely questionable
[00:58:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In addition to creating safer and saner streets, bike lanes add tremendous economic value to a neighborhood. One stretch of Ninth Avenue in Manhattan saw retail sales rise nearly 50 percent after bike paths were installed, compared with a 3 percent rise borough-wide.30 Rents along the Times Square bike paths grew 71 percent in 2010, the largest increase in the city, as people flocked to pedestrian- and bike-friendly
[00:58:45] <Obormot\Arcturus>  neighborhoods.31 A single block in Indianapolis saw the value of its property jump nearly 150 percent after adding bike lanes.32" [emphasis mine]
[00:58:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that a good thing...? Rents growning 71%? Who is it a good thing for?
[00:59:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Landlords?
[00:59:12] <adiabatic> if you put a little bit of time into learning how to work Voice Control for iOS you can use it to control your iPad when your hands are wrist-deep in raw ground beef and don't want to take the time to control your iPad with your nose
[00:59:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if I don't want my rent to grow by 71%
[00:59:36] <adiabatic> it's not nearly as hard to learn as VoiceOver for blind people
[00:59:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Doesn't this actually directly contradict the thing the article says about how *actually*, contrary to what naive people think, equity is not zero sum, and helping one group doesn't harm another
[01:00:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure sounds like putting in bike paths harms ... everyone who has to live there and pay rent??
[01:00:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Then there are the benefits to public health and the environment. A study of the San Francisco Bay Area found that a slight increase in walking and biking each day can reduce the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease by 14 percent,33 while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions by 14 percent as well.34 If just 5 percent of New York City commuters began biking to work, the CO2 emissions saved would be equal to
[01:00:38] <Obormot\Arcturus>  planting a forest 1.3 times the size of Manhattan.35" ... what in the world does this have to do with curb cut effects
[01:00:59] <saturn2> maybe all of those landlords are also biking enthusiasts
[01:01:01] <adiabatic> On the other hand, all the work that was put into Voice Control might've been more useful _to me_ for just bug fixes
[01:01:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> The section about the GI Bill is (a) also not even slightly an example of a curb cut effect, (b) makes me think that maybe the GI Bill was a bad idea
[01:01:45] <adiabatic> because although it's nice to be able to play Fantasian in between burger bites, bug fixes are better
[01:02:30] <adiabatic> and when I say "play Fantasian", I mean "play Fantasian slowly and fight poorly"

This episode talked about curb…)
[01:04:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the 70s, other changes to the built environment, such as wheelchair lifts on buses, accessible bathrooms, and low countertops, came into play. Demonstrations and protests were held across the country demanding these changes be implemented in all facilities."
[01:04:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also not examples of the curb cut effect! Wheelchair lifts on buses don't benefit anyone but the disabled!
[01:04:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Accessible bathrooms actually harm non-disabled people, by taking up space that could be used for multiple normal stalls

[01:05:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think it's great that we have accessible bathrooms, don't get me wrong, and wheelchair lifts ditto, but they just aren't the curb cut effect
[01:05:35] <saturn2> elevators and ramps that were installed for wheelchair users also benefit able-bodied people by allowing them to eat so much they can no longer walk
[01:06:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[01:06:30] <adiabatic> I remember taking the elevator at the gym when the stairs were being used for some sort of window cleaning or whatever
[01:06:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "While there are many areas that need improvement, it doesn’t hurt to point out good examples of universal design and how they have helped everyone. A classic example is Oxo Good Grips.
[01:06:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> The creation of Oxo Good Grips started with the goal of creating a vegetable peeler that was easy and comfortable to use for someone with arthritis. In developing the product, the grip was tested with people of various ages, hand sizes, hand strength and dexterity. The consideration of a functional and attractive product for all peoples led to OXO Good Grips being a widely-recognized design and brand."
[01:06:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... except that at least half of the OXO Good Grips products pictured in the image are *bad*.
[01:07:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> That cheese grater? Terrible. The can opener? Poor.
[01:07:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whisk is ok, I have that one. It's a whisk, hard to fuck it up too much
[01:08:51] <nshepperd> oxo good grips? good god
[01:09:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "To conclude, accessibility should not be considered a barrier. Designing with all people in mind doesn’t hold you back but rather forces you to make the experience better for everyone." ... the more I try to track down examples, the more I think that this is... well, not exactly a lie, but much less often true than people like to claim
[01:09:16] <Ralith> it is entirely possible to fuck up a whisk
[01:09:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, sometimes designing for accessibility makes it better for everyone
[01:09:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Other times, designing for accessibility makes it worse for most people
[01:09:35] <Ralith> I've had them literally come apart in my hands, with sharp wires springing out energetically
[01:09:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And some of those times, it makes it mediocre even for the target audience)
[01:10:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: Ok, yeah, fair enough. Point is, it's a serviceable whisk, not noticeably better or worse than any other non-shitty whisk

[01:11:41] <Robomot> The Curb-cut Effect and Championing Equity | Learning for Justice (Centering the needs of underserved people often has a broader impact on the community. The same is true in schools.)
[01:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The best solutions were designed to help students and families least supported by the system. And those solutions proved widely beneficial. Universal meal programs designed to ensure food reached families experiencing homelessness and poverty also granted greater access to families who traditionally fall just outside of outdated free meal qualifications. Districts that suspended standard homework and grade models helped
[01:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus>  students who had to work or care for siblings and those experiencing mental health struggles. Schools that emphasized outreach to families who may not have access to public aid or home language resources—such as undocumented families—improved overall family engagement and communication.
[01:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> These targeted solutions with broad benefits illustrate what many advocates call a “curb-cut effect”—a phenomenon rooted in decades of activism that has newfound relevance in the ongoing fight to center equity in our schools."

[10:06:31] <feep[work]> I still don't see it
[10:06:50] <feep[work]> it has something to do with as you scale up the white area, you scale up the shaded area something something inverse proportionally, but I don't have a strong model

[10:07:40] <feep[work]> hang on, instead of reading it lemme throw that in sketchpad
[10:08:00] <rsaarelm> Well, something something in relation to the chord length
[10:08:13] <feep[work]> idk what the chord length is but hang on
[10:08:30] <Obormot\Gaia> I read the replies and they make absolutely no sense
[10:08:34] <rsaarelm> The white line is the chord, with length 12.
[10:09:31] <Obormot\Gaia> I read the rot13'd comment, which matches what I saw in the Twitter replies, and it continues to make zero sense
[10:09:33] <nshepperd2> i let x = the radius of the purple disk segment, and grinded trigonometry with Mathematica. that's the approach you use if you don't know that there's an unambiguous answer
[10:10:05] <rsaarelm> Hm, should I just skip rot-13-ing and try to spell out what I think it is...
[10:11:10] <Obormot\Gaia> Nah, I think this puzzle is dumb
[10:11:39] <rsaarelm> Nah, it's sort of neat if I figured it right.
[10:12:03] <nshepperd2> now that I know the answer doesn't depend on x, i can solve it by just taking the limit x->12, which makes the white circle disappear

[10:13:37] <rsaarelm> So basically whatever the size of the white hole, the area of the big purple quarter with the hole is the same as what the area of a smaller purple quarter with no hole and with a side length equal to the white line would be.
[10:13:48] <feep[work]> basically because both are circles and one is the radius and the other the diameter, it cancels out exactly
[10:13:57] <feep[work]> er, some inverse of the radius
[10:14:19] <feep[work]> oyeah cause it's the square root for getting the hypothenuse and then the square for the area
[10:14:42] <nshepperd2> rsaarelm: yeah
[10:14:44] <feep[work]> that is disgustingly clever
[10:15:15] <rsaarelm> It's confusing when the replies say "if the size of the hole doesn't matter I can make it go to zero", because wtf, the hole is huge, not zero-sized.
[10:15:25] <feep[work]> rsaarelm: the idea is that the hole is a free parameter
[10:15:35] <feep[work]> so because we know for a fact it's solvable, the parameter must not matter
[10:15:57] <feep[work]> so might as well set it to zero to be convenient
[10:15:58] <rsaarelm> And you need to figure out it's talking about a family of solutions which all have the white line labeled 12, and at the limit the white line merges with the radius of the purple circle.
[10:16:13] <feep[work]> yeah there's kinda a bunch of implied constraints there
[10:16:54] <nshepperd2> a mathematician's favourite phrase: "without loss of generality"
[10:17:37] <feep[work]> I think the rule is: shapes must stay the same sort of shape, right angles must stay right angles, figures that touch must keep touching, given numbers must not be changed, all else is variable
[10:18:51] <quanticle> Yeah, the important thing there is that the "12" remains 12 regardless of how you scale the system

[13:30:14] <PapuaHardyNet> what is a unet?
[13:30:29] <PapuaHardyNet> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net
[13:30:29] <Robomot> U-Net - Wikipedia (U-Net is a convolutional neural network that was developed for biomedical image segmentation at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg.[1] The network is based on the fully convolutional network[2] and its architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentations. …)
[13:31:29] <RiversHaveWings> PapuaHardyNet: it takes an input image the same size as the output image and is symmetrical, it has n downsampling stages followed by n upsampling stages, and there are skip connections between the pre-downsample layer and the post-upsample layer for each resolution.
[13:32:24] <RiversHaveWings> it is for learning arbitrary transformations of images to images of the same size, the skip connections preserve the exact spatial location of features so it doesn't have to learn to reconstruct them
[13:32:42] <RiversHaveWings> (and potentially do it badly)
[13:32:58] <PapuaHardyNet> col, so like a better gan
[13:33:03] <PapuaHardyNet> cool*
[13:33:19] <RiversHaveWings> u-nets are for all kinds of things
[13:33:48] <RiversHaveWings> but i am interested in diffusion models, which use a u-net architecture and are generative models
[13:34:07] <RiversHaveWings> they were originally made for segmentation i think.
[13:34:17] <RiversHaveWings> image goes in, segmentation map goes out
[13:40:46] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah I read the wiki page closer, it was originally made for segmentation maps
[13:41:38] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, to answer your original question to the best of my abilities, stax is simply a library of construction functions. While it looks good, I found it too complicated to use in practice as I tried to build a capsule network

[14:05:10] <shawwwn> but the code is horrible and I never cleaned it up
[14:05:21] <shawwwn> it uses masking to do bucket sampling
[14:05:43] <shawwwn> so it only recompiles every 16 token length differences
[14:06:29] <shawwwn> and on TPUs it uses bfloat16, and can sample 256 tokens from 1.5B in like 20sec. (I forget the exact numbers)

[14:22:58] <shawwwn> it took a few weeks to understand everything, but now I prefer it
[14:24:16] <shawwwn> jax is simple at heart: you pass in all model parameters as arguments (along with inupt), and return output

[14:34:38] <shawwwn> when I used your lib, I was surprised to find that I didn't really run into that kind of problem
[14:35:09] <shawwwn> I think if possible it would be best to avoid passing the context into the ctor
[14:35:15] <shawwwn> because it ends up cascasding
[14:35:18] <nshepperd> hm
[14:35:36] <nshepperd> yes, it's inconvenient to have to pass it down to all submodules
[14:36:04] <nshepperd> The alternative would be an initialise(self, cx) method you could override or something
[14:36:06] <shawwwn> it's particularly problematic for things like modulelists and sequential
[14:36:31] <shawwwn> but I can't remember why. I just remember I ran into a similar design problem involving those + having to pass in constructor values
[14:37:02] <nshepperd> sequential seemed fine in my prototype
[14:37:14] <shawwwn> yeah I think I'm just hallucinating
[14:37:23] <nshepperd> that and modulelist would not take cx
[14:37:31] <nshepperd> just the already constructed modules
[14:37:47] <shawwwn> that's the problem tho. or it was for me
[14:37:58] <shawwwn> because the child modules get constructed before the modulelist parent
[14:38:07] <shawwwn> meaning they update context before the modulelist does
[14:38:17] <shawwwn> but that probably isn't a problem for your lib
[14:41:20] <nshepperd2> nah, that's no problem
[14:44:31] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: was this in the context of something similar to your VariableContext thing, where the thing you pass down is cx.scope('module name')?
[14:45:17] <shawwwn> yeah, exactly. the modulelist needed to be the parent scope
[14:45:18] <nshepperd2> bc i can see how that would be a problem for module lists
[14:45:42] <shawwwn> and thanks for solving it. It was bugging me I couldn't remember what the problem was
[14:45:49] <shawwwn> but
[14:47:44] <shawwwn> in my tftorch lib, you can mess with the scope string however you want. so the solution is simply to prepend the modulelist name to the scope when constructing each child module, then pass all the children into the modulelist constructor
[14:47:57] <shawwwn> it was ugly
[14:50:08] <shawwwn> I think alternatively I may have done something like ModuleList(lambda s: [foo(s, 'foo'), bar(s, 'bar'), baz(s, 'baz')]) since that delays construction
[14:50:53] <shawwwn> was also toying around with the idea of some kind of "with ModuleList() as parent: ... construct children ..." thing, but that was too far away from torch API

[14:56:36] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: that's why your approach seems superior though
[14:56:54] <shawwwn> you don't resolve parameters until the forward pass (or something like that)
[14:57:31] <shawwwn> so the parameter construction is delayed, which means all the parameters are already assigned to the right places. no need to keep track of scope
[14:58:45] <shawwwn> i.e. solving the problem of "how do you specify an initializer for each parameter without actually initializing it immediately?" also solves the problem of "I need to pass a scope string through the constructors"
[14:59:07] <shawwwn> because the only reason the scope string is needed is because parameters are being constructed instantaneously

[15:01:33] <feep[work]> this evening! I'm adding this to neat: int i = 5, j = 6; assert(i + j == i.(that + j));
[15:01:45] * shawwwn sort of hates explicit scoping, but also sort of likes it -- it gives you control over the parameter serialization layout / lets you reuse parameters across two different modules just by using the same scope + name
[15:03:52] <shawwwn> feep[work]: if 'that' refers to the previous comma'd value, also consider making if (foo()) { print(it); } -- 'it' refers to the expression in the conditional of the 'if'
[15:04:39] <feep[work]> shawwwn: way ahead of you :) if (auto it = foo())
[15:04:41] <shawwwn> ditto for while: while(read()) { append(it); }
[15:05:04] <shawwwn> hmm
[15:05:32] <shawwwn> can you #define aif(x) if (auto it = (x)) ?
[15:05:35] <feep[work]> no #define
[15:05:39] <feep[work]> also that's terrible
[15:06:01] <shawwwn> anaphoric macros have been a thing for a long time
[15:06:31] <feep[work]> x.(that ? print(that) : void); XD
[15:07:56] <shawwwn> that's actually pretty nice, but I vote using 'it' instead of 'that'
[15:08:55] <shawwwn> (foo() + bar()).(it ? 'yes' + it : 'no')
[15:09:01] <shawwwn> something like that
[15:09:05] <shawwwn> or something like it, ha
[15:10:33] <feep[work]> the thought for "that" was because it matches "this" from classes

[15:19:56] <synthmeat> all you fine fellas good today as well?
[15:21:06] <shawwwn> yis. today I'm trying to set up an S corp so that I can pay myself 60% income as salary and 40% income as dividends, to dodge self employment tax
[15:21:27] <shawwwn> apparently it's called the 60/40 rule or something
[15:21:44] <shawwwn> (dividends aren't taxed)
[15:23:57] <shawwwn> and I also have to decide whether to accept a full time job for $N/yr + $40k bonus, or do a contract rate of closer to $2*N for 3 months
[15:24:41] <shawwwn> theoretically $2*N is more lucrative long term
[15:24:57] <shawwwn> but it depends whether they keep renewing the contract
[15:25:36] <Gurkenglas> Is it about the money for you? How long would you expect to stay at the full time job?
[15:26:21] <shawwwn> it's about the money because I don't know what else to focus on in life
[15:26:38] <shawwwn> I already learned all the things I wanted to learn, and did all the career things I wanted to do
[15:26:43] <Gurkenglas> Have you considered maximizing the probability that you/we make it through the coming century?
[15:27:18] <shawwwn> I wouldn't want to be alive at 112yo
[15:27:34] <Gurkenglas> Because you see what today's 112yos are like?
[15:28:13] <shawwwn> because after 60 or so, my brain will deteriorate and I won't be able to build anything interesting
[15:28:39] <Gurkenglas> Have you considered maximizing the probability that you/we make it through the coming century with an undeteriorated brain?
[15:28:40] <Betawolf> So you'll be able to relate to most people? That does sound horrible.
[15:29:40] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: there was a recent mathematical discovery made by a 58yo. but beyond that, it gets hard to find anything significant
[15:30:08] <Gurkenglas> Yes, the problem would have to be attacked at a technological level.
[15:30:39] <shawwwn> sometimes I wonder if that's why carmack is building agi
[15:30:48] <shawwwn> chasing immortality / serializing one's brain into a computer
[15:30:58] <Gurkenglas> The probability that you put on the problem being *unsolvable* by future tech should not reasonably be small enough to give up on that branch.
[15:31:26] <shawwwn> well, it's more like -- if it's solvable, it'll be some old rich white dude that enjoys the solution before I do
[15:31:47] <Gurkenglas> Maybe 10 years before you do!
[15:32:02] <shawwwn> we all die. I accepted that long ago
[15:32:17] <shawwwn> worrying too much about the future just wastes what time you have in the present
[15:32:33] <Gurkenglas> See where that got you, you don't know what to focus on in life.
[15:33:33] <shawwwn> well, my sole focus is starting a family. it's been tough because IVF costs $40k. so that's why I was focusing on maximizing cashflow
[15:33:52] <Gurkenglas> Weird. What part of it is expensive?
[15:33:52] <shawwwn> but then suddenly emily's new job covers IVF
[15:34:37] <shawwwn> and now I'm apparently going to be doing two contracts simultaneously, for $N + $2N
[15:34:56] <shawwwn> so I figure, may as well just satisfy all my jew urges
[15:35:22] <Gurkenglas> You do not, in fact, have sufficient evidence to conclude that making it to the future intact is impossible. You may have concluded so to make your model fit your revealed preferences. I suggest that you instead conclude that you don't care about making it to the future intact.

[15:35:57] <shawwwn> you're right! I don't :)
[15:36:39] <shawwwn> my regrets are that I never was able to make an anime DALL-E, and that I didn't have kids about 5 years ago
[15:37:54] *** Quits: momus (~m@8.21.8.165) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[15:38:10] <Gurkenglas> Nice. That update should put you in position to be corrupted to my side by reading science fiction. And you should be okay with that.
[15:38:36] <shawwwn> other than those, life is wonderful, I spend each day with my soulmate, and I have so many blessings that "ungodly rich" wouldn't be too much of a lifestyle change.
[15:39:16] <shawwwn> it's also making up for lost time, since I made a bunch of stupid decisions when I was younger. e.g. putting $0 into 401k
[15:39:28] <shawwwn> even though my first employer would've matched it dollar for dollar
[15:39:54] <shawwwn> I think I was vaguely worried about "something like 2008 happening again" + "maybe peak oil might happen"
[15:40:12] <Gurkenglas> Reasonable enough.
[15:40:28] <shawwwn> but
[15:40:40] <shawwwn> you seem disappointed with money as a motive
[15:40:54] <shawwwn> why do you want to last to the next century? what's so special about it?
[15:41:14] <Gurkenglas> I expect that if I make it one century I make it thousands.
[15:41:39] <shawwwn> yeah, that was one thing that depressed me reading scifi
[15:41:51] <shawwwn> knowing that I won't be married to emily for hundreds of thousands of years
[15:42:05] <shawwwn> I try not to think about it too much
[15:42:13] <Gurkenglas> I do not value billions of years >100x the next hundred years, but all in all >50% of utility lies in making it through the singularity.
[15:42:36] <shawwwn> hm
[15:43:14] <shawwwn> one of my dirty secrets is that I've never really given much thought to singularities
[15:43:19] <shawwwn> other than black holes
[15:43:33] <Gurkenglas> I expect that you survive it iff she survives it, given that you both make it to it.
[15:43:39] <shawwwn> it just seems like wishing for antigravity or fusion reactors
[15:43:53] <shawwwn> it'll be nice when it happens, but you and I seem unlikely to reap the benefits
[15:45:12] <shawwwn> a famous person asked me "what's your prior on AGI happening within this decade?" and I said "0% without blinking twice"
[15:45:24] <shawwwn> agi doesn't seem impossible, but it does seem like it'll take another few hundred years
[15:45:31] <shawwwn> people underestimate how hard it is to make an evolution simulator
[15:45:40] <feep[work]> why would agi have anything to do with evolution
[15:45:45] <shawwwn> and right now no one is trying to make evolution simulators
[15:46:17] <feep[work]> this argument is the sort of thing like "people think we can build flying machines, but we have no idea how to construct an artificial feather"
[15:46:45] <shawwwn> agi by definition is intelligent life. the only mechanism we're aware of to produce intelligent life is evolution. so either agi will be made via evolution, or agi will be made by bypassing evolution
[15:46:53] <shawwwn> right now, everyone is trying to bypass evolution
[15:46:56] <feep[work]> yes
[15:47:00] <feep[work]> because it seems vastly easier :P
[15:47:07] <shawwwn> hubris
[15:47:22] <feep[work]> calling names is not an argument.
[15:47:55] <shawwwn> once we're all dead, and another couple generations of scientists come and go, I suspect they'll try it from the other direction: "how hard would it be to literally make an evolution simulator?"
[15:48:07] <feep[work]> still not an argument.
[15:48:26] <feep[work]> personally, my estimate is ten years.
[15:48:33] <Gurkenglas> How did you come to think that bypassing it won't work to build an AGI, but bypassing it worked to make MuZero and GPT?
[15:49:03] <shawwwn> because I understand that MuZero and GPT are nothing more than curve fitting
[15:49:12] <feep[work]> um
[15:49:16] <feep[work]> curve fitting is turing complete
[15:49:38] <Gurkenglas> Less rudely, feep.
[15:49:43] <feep[work]> what
[15:49:43] <feep[work]> it is
[15:49:55] <Gurkenglas> I agree, but I don't want him to get tired of the conversation :P
[15:50:26] <shawwwn> well, the way I look at it is, you're all setting yourselves up to be bitterly disappointed on your deathbed
[15:50:33] <shawwwn> I'd rather reach it with no regrets
[15:50:59] <shawwwn> agi is a nice fantasy. but fusion reactors seem vastly more likely
[15:51:12] <feep[work]> I mean, a transistor is literally just a relu curve fit
[15:51:33] <feep[work]> ironically, I think fusion will not be reached before ai
[15:52:20] <feep[work]> sigmoid* curve fit
[15:53:08] <Gurkenglas> Suppose you could choose between a 100% chance of your life with her and a 50% chance of an infinite life with her. Which would you prefer? Note that both answers are allowed.
[15:53:11] <shawwwn> as far as I can tell, most people's logic is along the lines of "we have lots of computing power, increasing exponentially; DL has made impressive advances recently; therefore AGI might be close"
[15:53:23] <feep[work]> that is not my logic
[15:53:36] <feep[work]> I think we have more than enough computing power for agi rn

[15:53:46] <shawwwn> hubris
[15:54:11] <feep[work]> it's more ... when I look at dl and what separates it from agi, it increasingly seems to me that only about two fundamental breakthroughs may be needed
[15:54:25] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: that's a tough question.
[15:54:28] <feep[work]> and, I can't remember what it was, but I saw a research paper a few months ago that made me update it to "maybe only one fundamental breakthrough"
[15:54:43] <feep[work]> maybe 1.6 ish
[15:54:48] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: to be honest, I'm not sure. I'll have to think on it
[15:55:35] <shawwwn> all you'll get is a creature that doesn't understand anything. even if it can remember and can see, it has no evolutionary pressure to make sense of the world
[15:55:54] <feep[work]> gpt makes sense of the world
[15:56:11] <feep[work]> our current approaches "get that sort of thing for free" via pure compression
[15:56:22] <feep[work]> or, I guess, pure reinforcement, which is approximately the same thing
[15:56:27] <shawwwn> yes. but utilizing the knowledge to navigate the world is a different matter.
[15:56:31] <feep[work]> yes
[15:56:33] <Gurkenglas> If you prefer the 50%, then your real-world policy seems sane :). Though you may want to check whether she would want to participate in the world's plot *with* you.
[15:56:35] <feep[work]> for that we have mcts
[15:57:08] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: I'm not sure I'd risk the next 40 years with emily on a coin flip, even if the upside was infinite
[15:57:16] *** Joins: momus (~m@8.21.8.165)
[15:57:22] <feep[work]> the upside is not necessarily infinite
[15:57:26] <shawwwn> too sad to think about the downside
[15:57:32] <feep[work]> infinite time != infinite upside
[15:57:47] <Gurkenglas> You don't have to decide, my current best guess about how to model preferences is as an uncertainty over utility functions.
[15:57:55] <feep[work]> for instance, "the sort of experiences that a person who is recognizeably yourself can have" may be a finite set
[15:58:59] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], you don't need to make that argument, he already doesn't assign infinite utility to the outcome, as per his answer to the question.
[15:59:00] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: I'd risk half my remaining time in exchange for half of infinity
[15:59:05] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: aight
[15:59:23] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, half of infinity being a 50% chance at infinity?
[15:59:39] <shawwwn> at infinity/2 :)
[16:01:08] <Gurkenglas> Let's just put that silly cheating aside after noting that the math doesn't actually have that vulnerability :P.
[16:02:11] <shawwwn> fusion reactors are actually a nice model for "why agi probably won't lead to immortality anyway"
[16:02:22] <shawwwn> if fusion reactors became prolific worldwide, and energy was totally free
[16:02:33] <shawwwn> I still see no way of doubling the average human lifespan
[16:02:42] <shawwwn> what makes you think agi will find a way?
[16:03:04] <shawwwn> even if it did, you'd probably end up serialized along with millions of other people
[16:03:10] <shawwwn> a mixing bowl of personas
[16:03:29] <shawwwn> would you take immortality if you had to be lerp'ed together with others?
[16:03:40] <Gurkenglas> I'm gonna guess there's animals whose brains stay functional beyond a hundred years
[16:03:54] <shawwwn> sure. lobsters, octopii
[16:03:59] <shawwwn> tortoises
[16:04:41] <Gurkenglas> Do you think one could make your brain last for the same reason, without replacing you with something that isn't you?
[16:04:58] <feep[work]> shawwwn: what sort of logic is that
[16:05:27] <feep[work]> "if I had feathers, I still couldn't fly. therefore human flight is impossible."
[16:05:46] <shawwwn> I don't think so, because people change drastically every decade. "who you are" isn't constant
[16:06:06] <shawwwn> therefore the goal of preserving oneself independent of your brain is already ill defined
[16:06:09] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, do you care about the you two decades hence?
[16:06:34] <Urchin[emacs]> Tamerlane was an early flight enthusiast, he made a lot of people fly and didn't mind that there were no survivors
[16:06:36] <feep[work]> "preserving oneself independent of your brain"?
[16:06:38] <shawwwn> not particularly. I'm using it as a way of showing that the problem may be ill defined
[16:06:52] <shawwwn> your brain (and its deterioration) literally defines you
[16:07:00] <feep[work]> that's ... no
[16:07:02] <Gurkenglas> aka, do you care whether your life with her lasts 20 years or 40?
[16:07:07] <shawwwn> attempting to serialize it into a turtle or a computer will fundamentally make you not-you
[16:07:10] <feep[work]> if you have a brain tumor, that doesn't make you a "tumory person"
[16:07:33] <feep[work]> "he's just a person with a tumor in his brain, if we remove the tumor, is it even the same person"

[16:07:52] <feep[work]> defining yourself by aging dementia is a choice, and not a very good one imo
[16:08:32] <feep[work]> also I feel this is one of those "willing to grapple with it for as many centuries as it takes" problems
[16:09:00] <Gurkenglas> i agree it's a choice, and i agree that, like, cryonics doesn't really cut it when i already don't really remember more than a few years back, so i'll be dead by the time i'm dead
[16:09:14] <Gurkenglas> my response is to plan to resurrect a continuum of my past selves post-singularity.
[16:09:15] <feep[work]> (after all, people are killed when they die...!)
[16:10:30] <feep[work]> also- I think I remember enough of my pre-adult self that I can say that I count as a valid continuation even with that huge change
[16:10:59] <feep[work]> if you expect to be unrecognizeably yourself to yourself ten years from now... isn't that kind of sad?
[16:11:55] <Gurkenglas> what counts as you is just an evolutionary adaptation for cooperating with your past and future selves. the way to dissolve the continuity of identity problem is to 1. care about your current self 2. use a decision theory that rescues the behavior of cooperating with the past and future inhabitants of your body
[16:12:13] <feep[work]> acausal embrace~
[16:17:12] <Gurkenglas> There is a sense in which "this hypothesis about what i care about judges every outcome equally good" lets you boot that hypothesis. Booting a hypothesis because it's sad is, uh, less sensible.
[16:19:33] <feep[work]> sure but it's a free variable, right?
[16:19:46] <feep[work]> the utility function is whatever you make of it~
[16:19:53] <Gurkenglas> much like utility is - it's not up for grabs!
[16:20:15] <feep[work]> it is totally up for the sort of grabs implied by "isn't that kind of sad?"
[16:23:21] <Gurkenglas> Now wait a minute. Are you saying that, if you don't know whether you prefer world a or world b, and then you find out you are in world a, that you should update towards prefering world a?
[16:26:19] <Gurkenglas> it's called sour grapes, and leads to such silliness as calling death good.
[16:29:22] <Gurkenglas> it optimizes for feeling good instead of satifying values, which leads to such silliness as uploading someone and then lying to them about it.
[16:30:48] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: the trick is that i identify parameters with random unique identifiers (ie. object ids), and only *name* them afterward, so yeah there's no need to pass a scope down or anything during construction
[16:30:55] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: what, no
[16:31:41] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: I'm saying, if you don't know if you prefer *future world a or b*, that is a fundamentally different *kind* of hypothesis from which world you live in
[16:32:36] <Gurkenglas> I agree. The second kind is aggregated by taking an expectation and the first isn't.
[16:32:55] <feep[work]> yes
[16:33:16] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: the point is, when I said "isn't that kind of sad", that is the sort of evidence that is used to update the first kind of hypothesis.
[16:33:24] <Gurkenglas> No it's not!
[16:34:05] <Gurkenglas> By sad you mean "that hypothesis assigns less utility to everything", right?
[16:36:54] <feep[work]> no?
[16:37:07] <feep[work]> I mean it makes me feel sad and that is evidence it's a bad goal
[16:38:23] <Gurkenglas> It sounds like your preferences are about your model. In which case you may be justified to make non-Lawful updates.
[16:38:47] <Gurkenglas> Or maybe I'm still misunderstanding. How is it evidence it's a bad goal?
[16:39:41] <feep[work]> I have preferences about my value function, yes
[16:39:53] <feep[work]> or rather, it's a matter of update propagation
[16:40:26] <Gurkenglas> Would you wirehead, given the chance?
[16:40:34] <feep[work]> this is all because the human value function is amorphous, self-contradictory and consists of a thousand independent shards
[16:40:37] <feep[work]> certainly not!
[16:41:08] <Gurkenglas> What's your relevant preference, in this case, about your value function?
[16:41:16] <feep[work]> well
[16:41:38] <feep[work]> if I think about the future where I don't get to identify with a future version of myself as myself at all, that seems disappointing and kind of infantile
[16:41:50] <feep[work]> and so I want my identity to be wide enough to avoid that fate.
[16:45:05] <Gurkenglas> If it is disappointing because you like to imagine to survive, then may I suggest the lesser departure from Lawfulness of compensating for that update by discounting harder?
[16:46:14] <Gurkenglas> ...huh, discounting suddenly makes sense when you model it as how much you care about the future inhabitants of your body.
[16:46:40] <feep[work]> this is totally unrelated to lawfulness
[16:46:44] <feep[work]> and yes
[16:46:57] <feep[work]> as you noted, the utility function is not up for grabs
[16:50:00] <Gurkenglas> (lawfulness as in "turning true premises only into true conclusions" and "approximating bayes" etc.)
[16:50:13] <feep[work]> (yes)
[16:50:13] <Gurkenglas> (...i've been reading EY's glowfics lately)

[17:18:41] <Gurkenglas> Well, you don't have enough evidence for that! Therefore I suspect you too of updating your model (including, foolishly, the utility-uncertainty-mass) until it explained your revealed preferences, when instead you should have updated the wireheading-is-infinitely-good part of your model to wireheading-is-finitely-good
[17:19:14] <Obormot\Gaia> Wireheading is bad and no one should do it
[17:19:26] <Gurkenglas> and since mass*utility for utility=infinte can only be finite if mass is 0, you had to shrink the mass until it was 0
[17:19:45] *** Joins: two2thehead (~AVX0@27.114.177.189)
[17:22:49] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Gaia, I agree (except that people should be allowed to wirehead just as they should be allowed to kill themselves), but that doesn't mean that i must assign 0 utility-uncertainty-mass to the hypothesis that utility is equal to total feelgood hormones.
[17:23:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is utility-uncertainty-mass
[17:23:55] <Gurkenglas> the word i use instead of probability to make clear that you do not aggregate an uncertainty over utilities by taking an expectation
[17:24:41] <Gurkenglas> this cannot be driven home enough. utility functions are invariant under multiplying by a constant and adding a constant, therefore so must be all operations involving them
[17:24:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And how can utility be equal to total feelgood hormones when in fact utility is just a function U such that U(x) > U(y) iff you would choose x over y
[17:25:29] <Gurkenglas> well, utility would be that if the agent under consideration chose between futures on the basis of expected hormones.
[17:25:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's obviously false
[17:25:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody chooses anything on the basis of expected hormones
[17:25:58] <synthmeat> firefox is pretty great browser for businesses
[17:26:59] <feep[work]> flock names~
[17:27:06] <Gurkenglas> indeed, nobody assigns 100% mass to that hypothesis. but one needs not assign 0% to it in order to not turn the cosmos into hedonium, when one uses the decision theory i have in mind.
[17:27:07] <feep[work]> a busyness of suits
[17:27:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, while I agree that you don't aggregate an uncertainty over utilities by taking an expectation, (a) how do you then aggregate it, and (b) how do you even have an uncertainty over utilities given that you don't directly have beliefs about utilities
[17:29:15] <Gurkenglas> i don't yet know how to aggregate it. i expect that you get these uncertainties by 1. modeling a human as negotiating subagents 2. modeling a democracy or FAI as trying to satisfy the populace 3. modeling a multiverse of sovereigns doing acausal trade right. I expect the proper aggregation method is the same in each case.
[17:29:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you model a human as negotiating subagents then there's no guarantee that you can ever, even in principle, even *construct* a utility function
[17:29:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (WHich there's no guarantee of anyway)
[17:30:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And indeed a guarantee of specifically *not* that)
[17:30:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Because humans don't have utility functions)
[17:30:11] <Gurkenglas> indeed, i don't expect that the proper aggregation method spits out a utility function.
[17:30:25] <Gurkenglas> (It should spit out decisions eventually, though.)
[17:30:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok so what's the point of even talking about utility then
[17:30:40] <feep[work]> can confirm: I spit out decisions all day
[17:30:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> But do you gargle them first
[17:31:07] <feep[work]> probably
[17:31:44] <feep[work]> AND WITH THAT SAID, AFK GOING HOME \o/
[17:32:23] <synthmeat> home's the best \o
[17:33:33] <Gurkenglas> I'm trying to embed utility function space in a larger space such that 1. you can aggregate in it 2. you can make decisions with it. the obvious, free example candidate for that space is "distributions over utility functions", which you aggregate by flattening nested distributions. this makes it hardest to deduce decisions, of course.
[17:34:36] <Gurkenglas> VNM axioms may not be necessary for an agent but they sure look sufficient - that's why there should be an embedding from utility function space.
[17:35:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> VNM axioms are violated by humans, therefore this can't apply to humans, therefore the whole question of whether utility is hormones is entirely mis-aimed

[17:37:48] <Gurkenglas> the "modeling a human as negotiating subagents" bit above makes me hopeful that once we make the space large enough to aggregate properly, it'll already include humans

[18:44:30] <kuudes> also legitimate interest is not a legal cause for setting up data on user device, only consent is. it is a legal cause for personal data processing though
[18:45:14] <kuudes> "Another important thing to note is that we might not need consent pop-ups at all. “Consent is the way we see it now because these advertising companies have decided it is that way,” Nouwens said. The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission are currently discussing a set of complementary measures to the GDPR called the ePrivacy Regulation. As part of these discussions, a proposal was made to consider 
[18:45:14] <kuudes> the cookie preferences you set in your browser as legal consent. That way, users would have to express their preferences only once, and decide what they are and aren’t OK with.
[18:45:14] <kuudes> Of course, the advertising industry isn’t happy about this idea. “It keeps getting lobbied out,” Nouwens said. Advertisers benefit from asking users to make decisions every single time – under our current system, they decide what consent pop-ups look like and how annoying and ineffective they seem."

[19:45:47] <shawwwn> These were (are…) the most glorious blinds I’ve ever seen
[19:46:01] <shawwwn> They’re clearly custom fitted to this specific window
[19:46:34] <shawwwn> So I was like ok, I’ll just look up how much a window costs. Maybe I can just pay our landlord back
[19:47:12] <shawwwn> “Window installation costs $6,049 total, or between $2,955 and $9,287. Labor costs $150 to $800 per window, or about $40 per hour. A single window unit runs $300 to $1,200 for standard sizes. Custom and bay windows cost $2,000 on average.”
[19:47:27] <shawwwn> Good f’ing lord windows are expensive

[19:57:40] <rmmh> I wonder what the breakdown of my $16k HVAC replacement was
[19:58:18] <rmmh> pfft it's not itemized where labor is separate
[19:58:23] <ggreer> btw I want to replace my AC units with japanese style ones (that have the vent mounted high up on the wall and a conduit going down to the compressor. anyone got ideas on where to source that stuff? I really don't want to have to import them from japan
[19:58:39] <rmmh> the mitsubishi minisplit ones?
[19:58:53] <rmmh> my brother installed a 2ton minisplit on his own
[19:58:54] <ggreer> yeah
[19:59:13] <ggreer> wow
[19:59:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why? Just for the "cool air sinks / hot air rises" convection benefit?
[19:59:31] <rmmh> in texas, targeted to cool a living room
[19:59:34] <shawwwn> $50k for labor
[19:59:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or is there some other hidden advantage
[19:59:49] <shawwwn> It costs less to go into actual labor in the US
[20:00:01] <ggreer> my place doesn't have central air. it's window units only (well, wall-mounted units)
[20:00:14] <rmmh> oh, that sucks
[20:00:34] <rmmh> so in this case ductless is appealing because it's the easiest to retrofit
[20:00:38] <ggreer> yeah
[20:00:57] <ggreer> and then I can put my breakfast table closer to the big windows on the balcony and not get blasted with air/noise
[20:01:08] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: the main advantage is you don't need central heating/cooling ducts already set up
[20:01:34] <rmmh> yeah window units are LOUD
[20:01:52] <rmmh> my new unit is 60dB... in the side yard :)
[20:01:53] <kuudes> shawwwn, could you remove those beforehand yourself and then put them back after they have installed new windows?
[20:01:55] <ggreer> also the mini split cools and heats so you can get rid of floorboard heaters

[20:06:34] <ggreer> yeah. I have a lot of other renovations to do (replace all flooring. replace oven, fridge, dishwasher. redo cabinets in the kitchen, repaint, install EV charger in the garage, etc)
[20:07:00] <rmmh> yay new house
[20:07:01] <ggreer> I figure I'll deal with the HVAC later, since the temps are pretty mild now
[20:07:22] <rmmh> mine was a little emergent since the AC was rusting through the furnace heater coils
[20:07:32] <ggreer> also the form factor is likely not the same as the existing AC units, so I might have to deal with the HOA (since it's on the outside)

[21:38:38] <Robomot> Ignatius of Loyola - Wikipedia (Ignatius of Loyola (born Iñigo López de Oñaz y Loyola; Basque: Ignazio Loiolakoa; Spanish: Ignacio de Loyola; Latin: Ignatius de Loyola; c. …)
[21:38:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "While recovering from surgery, Íñigo underwent a spiritual conversion and discerned a call to the religious life. In order to divert the weary hours of convalescence, he asked for the romances of chivalry, his favourite reading, but there were none in the castle, and instead his beloved sister-in-law, Magdalena de Araoz brought him the lives of Christ and of the saints.[7][21]
[21:38:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> The religious work which most particularly struck him was the De Vita Christi of Ludolph of Saxony.[22] This book would influence his whole life, inspiring him to devote himself to God and follow the example of Francis of Assisi and other great monks."
[21:39:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now... this could be exaggeration / confabulation, but still there's clearly *something* that made him convert, and it's not implausible that it was reading this book (and others like it)... but isn't this very strange?
[21:40:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems to be very different from the way modern people think and act! Who is driven to such a radical change of worldview, and a new devotion of such strength, by reading a book?

[22:58:52] * Obormot\Arcturus reads that interview, sees mention of someone named "Shulamith Firestone", looks them up: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulamith_Firestone
[22:58:53] <Robomot> Shulamith Firestone - Wikipedia (Shulamith "Shulie" Firestone (January 7, 1945 – August 28, 2012)[3] was a Canadian-American radical feminist, writer and activist. Firestone was a central figure in the early development of radical feminism and second-wave feminism and a founding member of three radical-feminist groups: New York Radical Women, Redstockings, and New York Radical Feminists. …)
[22:59:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Firestone was born Shulamith bath Shmuel ben Ari Feuerstein[2] in Ottawa, Canada on January 7, 1945.[13]Firestone was the second of six children and the first daughter of Orthodox Jewish parents Kate Weiss, a German Jew who fled the Holocaust, and Sol Feuerstein, a Brooklyn salesman.[4]" ... of course she was
[23:00:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Firestone's condition was officially diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia, following which, she was repeatedly hospitalized at Beth Israel Medical Center. Dr. Margaret Fraser, her psychiatrist, stated that she suffered from a particularly heinous form of Capgras syndrome, which caused her to believe that the people in her life “were hiding behind masks of faces.”[4]
[23:00:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Eventually, friends and acquaintances, under the guidance of Fraser, her psychiatrist, began a community effort to watch over and care for Firestone as her mental health deteriorated. When Fraser moved and her confidant Lourdes Cintron fell ill, the community of women disbanded, leaving Firestone to her psychosis and death.[4] " :\
[23:01:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, from the interview:
[23:02:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I also think one error that is consistently made in this discourse, in this kind of conversation about what's innate or what's natural, is to think about what's natural in terms of what's necessary. This is a point that Shulamith Firestone made a very long time ago, but that very few people register, which is that — and it was actually made again to me recently by a philosopher of biology, which is, "Look what's natural
[23:02:12] <Obormot\Arcturus>  isn't what's necessary."
[23:02:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's extraordinary. It's not even like what's natural offers a good equilibrium point. Think about how much time you and I spend sitting around. Completely unnatural for humans to sit around, yet we're in this equilibrium point where vast majority of humans just sit around all day." ... this is not, perhaps, as strong an argument for feminist revolution as she might imagine

[23:12:09] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I was impressed mostly in the chutzpah in so blatantly setting up her fallback excuse, and also the lack of thought it indicates she's given it if she really wants to apply is-ought to *human preferences and desires*, which is quite obviously where that gender dichotomizing is coming from
[23:13:17] <gwern> "ok, maybe it is *natural* that men and women have different desires and given liberty and material freedom to pursue them, wind up more different than in broke-ass third-world countries. but that doesn't mean it's good! We [by which I mean, feminists] know what they *ought* to want"
[23:13:43] <gwern> "and just as soon as we get elected tyrant, we'll *make* them want the same things"
[23:19:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yes... and of course there's also the part where, like... where does the behavior of the *parents* who "gender" their kids come from? Western patriarchy? It seems to have some truly shocking reach, if so...
[23:22:02] <Betawolf> the patriarchy is of course amazingly, ravishingly powerful
[23:23:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There’s a deeper feminist critique of the role of consent in sex, which objects to the preconditions that make the ritual of consent-asking and consent-giving necessary in the first place. When you say to someone, “Well, imagine sexual interaction without the ritual of consent-giving and consent-asking,” they just imagine sexual violation." ... wait, wait wait. This is a *feminist* critique now???
[23:23:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's... certainly a cogent critique, and obvious enough if you're not insane and think about real people for five minutes, but, uh... when did this become a feminist line

[23:31:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amazing, she totally fabricates, right on the spot, a lie about what Cowen *just said* and pretends that he asked something he didn't, all to avoid answering his question
[23:32:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Someone like Adrienne Rich wants to distinguish between the potentiality of human reproduction from the actual political institution that is motherhood. What is that institution? It’s an institution that has privatized the responsibility of childbirth, childcare, child-rearing into individual families. There’s still no universal 24-hour childcare." ... "privatized", lol
[23:34:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then she advocates for *universal 24-hour childcare*

[23:35:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It’s also systematically undervalued when it’s privatized in the form of healthcare and nursing. A lot would need to change. You might want to just hold out and say, “It’s only under conditions of intense coercion and desperation that women are willing to have children.” If that turns out to be right, I’ll bite the bullet and just say, fine." ... to be clear, the bullet she is biting here is the one where we end
