[01:36:06] <krb> trying to find it
[01:37:15] <standardRun> our country has some little area around a city in the south - where they want to find out what trees to plant for the future - but on completely different soil, climate, and other conditions- things are not going fast enough. they should plant trees now - and give brasilians money so they can feed their people without burning the rainwood forest

[11:59:34] <amigojapan> Hi lalia
[11:59:44] <lalia> I've put all my edits on Discord but am not sure where to throw them for sharing to IRC.
[12:00:04] <lalia> amigojapan: howdy. :) how's your day going?
[12:00:14] <amigojapan> lalia: Imgur?
[12:01:01] <amigojapan> lalia: not bad. But I still have an hour more of work to do in an hour
[12:01:35] <lalia> Sure, Imgur would probably work. :) Wasn't sure if anyone had a prefered FOSS platform or whathaveyou.
[12:02:32] <amigojapan> lalia: honestly Imgur is getting more and more buggy. But I still use it

[21:44:41] <trillian> PFAS is just one example showing the government really doesn't care about people's health
[21:44:55] <trillian> it's all over the place but they are not checking the health of people near contaminantion sites widely
[21:46:31] <trillian> instead of checking if people are ok testing their blood levels they get some dude from a council to just drink the water and say 'see it's fine' lol
[21:46:32] <trillian> idiots
[21:47:42] <trillian> anyway...oh well

[22:09:52] <pussipupu> Knights fighting snails are a major theme in medieval marginalia
[22:09:56] <gb73d> that stuff is marketable imho

[22:10:02] <Parf> yeah that's why i chose snail knights

[22:12:41] <Parf> yeah in the end, it's basically a new field of art
[22:13:16] <Parf> i feel pretty cutting edge, not that others couldn't do what i'm doing, but it still feels cutting edge. like, being able to whip up whatever style or theme on the fly in vast detail is itself just mindblowing.
[22:13:48] <Parf> it's like zombo.com where everything is attainable
[22:21:15] <gb73d> keep churning em out u will get recognized
