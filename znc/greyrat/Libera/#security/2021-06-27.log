[08:45:48] <calmclam> well it takes about 6 seconds to validate that you haven't tampered with the ink cartridge, another 10 seconds to squirt out a bunch of excess ink to waste it while pretending to calibrate itself, and then 1 second to print. So, the driver should have plenty of time.

[09:27:45] <SymbioticFemale> i don't know if i agree or not here. Rent seeking behavior, yes, of course. But, at the same time, almost every project who distributes binaries whether through centralized repositories or not has them signed by a central signing key
[09:28:53] <SymbioticFemale> it could certainly occur that a rootkit could make it into the ports tree of any open source OS and be signed & distributed by the project key/repos
[09:30:25] <SymbioticFemale> beyond that, lots of FOSS projects are distributing years old versions of software that are not kept up to date with security updates or releases
