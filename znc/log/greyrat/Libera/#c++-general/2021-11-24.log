[01:21:11] <johnny> they have a slack and a discord?

[01:21:19] <LordKalma> different things
[01:21:21] <PJBoy> that's all well defined AFAIK :/
[01:21:23] <LordKalma> different communities
[01:21:34] <PJBoy> what happened to the rumors of the slack being super rude and stuff
[01:21:52] <Alipha> `int x;` is well-defined until you try to access x without assigning it a value first
[01:22:01] <LordKalma> PJBoy, even last week a prominent member left
[01:22:05] <LordKalma> for those reasons
[01:22:12] <PJBoy> ah ok
[01:22:21] <LordKalma> which I don't understand why/how
[01:22:35] <LordKalma> that's why you don't hang around in the off-topic channels haha
[01:22:49] <LordKalma> the general channels and the channels I'm not are pretty legit
[01:26:16] <PJBoy> the include discord on the other hand is a place of rainbows and friendships
[01:26:33] <LordKalma> from the dicussion I just had it's also the place of dumb fucks

[01:27:42] <LordKalma> the regulars on the slack are a small bunch

[02:11:21] <TheGuestMovie> has anyone here used codementor.io? thoughts?
[02:11:42] <TheGuestMovie> basically you pay like 10-15 bucks per hour for a senior mentor
[02:11:44] <ville> if it's something web based it's crap
[02:11:45] <TheGuestMovie> allegedly
[02:12:11] <TheGuestMovie> ville: I'm using a web browser right now to talk to you
[02:12:34] <TheGuestMovie> in 2021 information is often exchanged using websites, yes
[02:12:54] <TheGuestMovie> oh sorry it's $1 per minute
[02:12:57] <TinoDidriksen> Are you the kind of person that learns best from mentors? Then it may be useful. It'd be worthless for most.
[02:13:07] <TinoDidriksen> $1 per minute? Ouch
[02:13:50] <TinoDidriksen> I'd say it's better to not spend any money and use the many free resources available.
[02:14:19] <TheGuestMovie> I'm not interested in it to learn programming, it's for more advanced stuff like software architecture, design plans, etc

[02:15:31] <kalven> How much of the "advanced stuff" can you realistically learn in that time from some rando?
[02:15:36] <TheGuestMovie> unless the guy's a stutterer, I'm in and out. Work on a shared example that I'll have prepared, get to the point, see his approach.
[02:15:59] <TheGuestMovie> In my experience guided mentorship is like 10x faster than studying on your own
[02:16:22] <TinoDidriksen> Mentoring is great when you need constant feedback, such as language learning. But for IT stuff...eh.
[02:16:22] <TheGuestMovie> it's why we still have classrooms in 2021
[02:17:05] <kalven> Is it some code that the mentor has prior knowledge of?
[02:18:14] <TheGuestMovie> kalven: no. It would be a simplified version of the sort of apps I work on, and where I'd like the opinion of someone familiar with a certain architecture.
[02:19:29] <kalven> TheGuestMovie: okay. I suppose it'll largely depend on how quickly the mentor can get into the thing you present and make meaningful improvements to it
[02:19:42] <kalven> (and how well that maps back to your actual application)
[02:21:22] <TheGuestMovie> yeah we'll see

They will never be growing or deleting any of the elements. NOW in my main Thread I Resize this DEQUE while these two threads are busy. Do I have to MUTEX it on Resize or will the impact not be noted by the lements the two threads are using?

[15:27:55] <PJBoy> yeah that doesn't make any sense
[15:28:35] <ashafq> PJBoy: He had a lot of coding problem challenges solved with really good explanations and I was using that as a guide.
[15:28:40] <PJBoy> > The Question published on this URL is a property of HackerRank
[15:28:46] <smallvil_> IF a resize causes references to deque elements to become invalid then it would also cause the threads to work with invalid data
[15:29:19] <ashafq> PJBoy: Perhaps if he just posted the answers and linked the questions, that would've worked.
[15:29:29] <PJBoy> mm
[15:29:39] <smallvil_> otherwise, assuming the resize does not invalidate, and is only extending the data, then you should not need a mutex since the data itself does not get touched by the resize
[15:30:03] <smallvil_> (or rather the elements do not get touched)
[15:30:25] <PJBoy> it's still scummy as fuck
[15:31:29] <PJBoy> cart_man, I reckon you need a mutex, yeah
[15:32:03] <ashafq> PJBoy: Copyright laws across countries is scummy in general
[15:32:11] <PJBoy> the vector embedded in the deque might need reallocating
[15:32:12] <smallvil_> but it depends on the container and it's specific's, i think for some a resize will cause references and iterators to become invalid
[15:32:57] <smallvil_> (for example to resize a container might simply allocate new memory, move all data to that new memory, and then delete the old memory)
[15:33:04] <PJBoy> deque resize invalidates all iterators
[15:33:41] <PJBoy> (and but all references are still valid)

[20:17:09] <PJBoy> it wouldn't compile, but it would parse
[20:17:14] <rpav> you cannot tokenize and determine without context what each token is

[20:17:21] <mort> C++ is hard to parse for lots of stupid reasons, most of which don't have to do with types being on the left side; but yes, deciding what's a type and what's an identifier is a special problem for C++ (and C)
[20:17:35] <yolo> that's the key, we put the noun at the last, so should be the parser
[20:17:53] <PJBoy> I dunno about that
[20:18:00] <rpav> PJBoy: it would not, as a function declaration is unlikely to be a first-class object :p
[20:18:01] <PJBoy> natural language has all sorts of random orders
[20:18:13] <yolo> programming language should be designed for human brain(the way we used to talk and write), the parser converted them to machine lang
[20:18:14] <mort> you honestly get used to go's right-handed types very quickly
[20:18:23] <PJBoy> yeah I'm sure
[20:18:32] <PJBoy> but it sure does seem like they do everything different just to be different
[20:18:52] <mort> I'm still not used to C/C++'s types and I've been programming in those languages as my main languages for a decade
[20:18:57] <rpav> "it's different and therefore bad and thus they're just being contrarians!"
[20:19:06] <PJBoy> I'm not saying C++ is a model example of grammer
[20:19:11] <PJBoy> but C# is pretty sensible
[20:19:26] <PJBoy> and it sure doesn't take any noticeable amount of time to compile
[20:19:35] <rpav> maybe learn/use more non-algol-family languages heh
[20:19:37] <mort> *foo[5], is that an array of pointers or a pointer to an array
[20:20:00] <PJBoy> it's an expression that dereferences element 5 of foo
[20:20:18] <Haohmaru> Modern Vaccination Program
[20:21:17] <mort> not if it's preceded with an identifier which happens to refer to a type, then it's a variable declaration
[20:21:19] <PJBoy> if you had a `T *foo[5];`, then decltype(foo) would be a type such that `*foo[5]` results in a T
[20:21:57] <PJBoy> the rules aren't great, but that's a neat property IMO
[20:22:03] <mort> that doesn't help in this case, does it dereference first or index first
[20:22:12] <PJBoy> indexes first
[20:22:20] <mort> it's a rhetorical question
[20:22:24] <PJBoy> suffix operators take precedence over prefix operators in any sane grammar
[20:22:42] <mort> the syntax doesn't make it clear is my point
[20:22:53] <PJBoy> I think it's clear
[20:22:59] <PJBoy> based on the reason I just gave

[20:53:20] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@61.171.38.68)
[20:54:10] <PJBoy> could rely on unique_ptr not having any member functions and using exclusively friend functions
[20:54:29] <rpav> like i said for `X x;` there _could still be_ some "specific-object-call" syntax that looks up the member/method on `X` rather than what `X::operator.()` would provide
[20:54:52] <PJBoy> so you'd have a "member access operator"
[20:55:04] <rpav> instead of forcing _all_ access through ->, you could force specific-case access through a lesser-used operator, and we could have nicer toys
[20:56:25] <PJBoy> so you'd have an operator that does overloadable member access, doing dereference if needed in the non overloaded case
[20:56:26] <kalven> call that operator <-
[20:56:34] <rpav> but i mean a lot of better decisions _could_ have been made
[20:56:37] <PJBoy> and an operator that can't be overloaded that does plain member access
[20:56:49] <rpav> my point is more, don't assume the way things are "make sense" more than other possibilities could have
[20:57:08] <PJBoy> yeah I'll agree to that
[20:57:11] <PJBoy> for sure
[20:58:49] <rpav> though tangentially, can one _not_ implement properties using -> .. is the object -> returns lifetime-extended to the statement at least

[23:09:07] <yolo> looks like I don't need go/rust's one build for all platforms after all, this gives me confidence to just use c/c++ for cross-platform
[23:11:20] <SuperNintendoSUX> C++ only. not C
[23:12:02] <yolo> thought macos/windows/linux can also do posix c just fine? maybe it's just ansi-c
[23:12:35] <comrad> windows does not posix, at least not without mingw
[23:12:56] <SuperNintendoSUX> isn't the new windows with a "linux layer" ?
[23:13:15] <yolo> good question, never played with WSL myself yet
[23:13:20] <comrad> yeah, but programming-wise not
[23:13:31] <yolo> looks like a docker container running linux side for windows to invoke to me
[23:14:14] <yolo> but you have many are still using windows7/8, WSL is only win10/11
[23:15:09] <hnOsmium0001[m]> nobody stops you from writing a linux version and claims to have windows support through WSL, just like nobody stops you from writing a windows version and claims to have linux support through wine: it's not a good idea

[23:16:43] <yolo> while on the start of writing a cross-platform c++, I can install macos to virtualbox but I could not find a free windows 10/11 for virtualbox, so I can test win/macos in parallel, my machines are all on linux(for years)
[23:17:15] <yolo> maybe I can buy those $10 license of windows10 from ebay, never tried that, should be fine
[23:17:44] <comrad> we defined some set of operating system functions which we abstracted for each plattform
[23:18:01] <TinoDidriksen> Microsoft provides virtual machine images for development and testing.

[23:25:30] <hnOsmium0001[m]> mac pros are designed more for creative profressionals, for the PCIe expansion capability
[23:25:41] <LordKalma> the m1 is a cool machine for on the go development
[23:25:47] <LordKalma> and you get Mac AND ARM for testing :D
[23:25:59] <yolo> i c, mac-mini has 8GB 'unified memory', what a pity, android build requires 16GB minimum
[23:26:23] <yolo> can I replace mac-mini's ddr and hard-drive, or is apple locking everything down, which will not surprise anyone
