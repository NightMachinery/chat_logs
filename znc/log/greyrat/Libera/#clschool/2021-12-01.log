[03:36:12] <rotateq> ohai dre
[03:36:25] <dre> hai :) 
[03:36:56] <rotateq> so WHEN and UNLESS are macros that compile to IF expressions
[03:37:47] <rotateq> (when (= x y) (do-this) (do-that) ...) => (if (= x y) (progn (do-this) (do-that) ...))
[03:38:32] <dre> oh right, yes i forgot about that
[03:38:49] <pjb> rotateq: not necessarily. But as if.
[03:38:53] <rotateq> no problem, i just wanted to ask first
[03:39:19] <rotateq> pjb: okay your point
[03:39:47] <rotateq> so using something like WHEN is also useful for reading and getting the intention
[03:39:57] <pjb> Definitely. Formost for reading.
[03:41:04] <rotateq> like with parameters having earmuffs "ahh that is a parameter". other people get confused "what is this double pointer thingy here?" ^^
[03:41:41] <rotateq> and then you tell them "ooh, some new very deep hack no one knows about"
[03:44:22] <dre> so now my solution is this: https://dpaste.org/V62b
[03:44:42] <dre> still not sure what the best way to do the double mapc 
[03:45:28] <rotateq> i did it with two nested loops and now thought about how to do it cleverly in APL
[03:46:16] <rotateq> the sum table is easy with v being the vector of values "↑v+⊂v" ^^
[03:46:46] <pjb> dre: mapc is nice when you already have a function. Otherwise, in a case like yours, using dolist might be simplier and clearer.
[03:47:08] *** Joins: random-nick (~random-ni@87.116.180.220)
[03:47:17] <rotateq> oh even dolist
[03:48:14] <pjb> dre: instead of outputing strings, you may consider printing a sexp: (let ((x 20) (y 2000))   (print (list '= 2020 (list '+ x y)))) prints: (= 2020 (+ 20 2000))
[03:49:26] <pjb> dre: now, you may notice that + is commutative, and therefore your double-loop does the same job twice.
[03:50:06] <pjb> dre: then you may consider using maplist
[03:50:42] <rotateq> again, much that can be learned in such things :)
[03:51:04] <pjb> dre: instead of () at the end, you may use (values)
[03:53:19] <pjb> dre: see https://dpaste.org/vGyz
[03:55:09] <pjb> Or with two loops: (loop with thenumbers =  '(1721 979 366 299 675 1456) for (x . rest) on thenumbers append (loop for y in rest when (= 2020 (+ x y)) collect (list '= 2020 (list '+ x y)))) #| --> ((= 2020 (+ 1721 299))) |# 
[03:56:23] <pjb> dre: note: I didn't use print in this last solution: it's better not to do I/O in function that compute things, (and vice-versa).
[03:56:52] <pjb> In a function that does I/O, you would only compute I/O relevant things (eg, columns, lines, number of characters, layout).
[03:56:53] *** Joins: bremner (~bremner@notmuch/developer/bremner)
[03:57:24] <dre> nice and all, but I'm still newbie :) 
[03:57:27] <dre> :P * 
[03:57:38] <dre> I mean i sorta get it but i don't know all the functions and other things 
[03:57:40] <pjb> Sure. This is why I shown several solutions.
[03:57:47] <pjb> Indeed.
[03:58:04] <dre> dolist and when works for me for now, wait until we get the first AoC problem :P
[03:58:24] <dre> but you're right, I need to assess your last solution

[16:28:08] <bremner> is there a nicer way  to do (append lst (list atom)) ?  (reverse (cons 'a (reverse '(b c)))) seems a bit obscure.
[16:41:18] <beach> lottaquestions: Did you see the answer in #commonlisp?
[16:42:03] <beach> bremner: The first one is the right one, except there is no reason to call a variable LST rather than LIST.
[16:42:21] <bremner> ah, right, found the schemer
[16:42:46] <beach> bremner: Then, you very rarely do that, because frequently, you then end up in a quadratic algorithm where a linear one exists.
[16:43:25] <bremner> yeah, I'm just trying to put a pathname together from 3 components, so that's not really an issue.
[16:43:46] <beach> And that might be why a function that does not require the call to LIST was not included in the standard.
[16:49:34] <beach> The world seems to divided into people who think that the Common Lisp standard is way too big and the people who lament the fact that their favorite niche utility was not included, like the recent "take a list of lists of numbers and return a list of the sums of each sublist".  Though sometimes I suspect there is significant overlap between those people.
[16:50:53] <bremner> well, I certainly feel both objects to the pathname API :)
[16:51:00] <bremner> s/objects/objections/
[16:52:25] <pjb>  bremner: (list dir name type)  (append (list dir name) (list type))   (cons dir (list name type))
[16:52:42] <pjb> bremner: instead of building it from first to last, you may try to build it from last to first.
[16:53:13] <pjb> (list* base-dir subdir relative-path-components)
[16:53:26] <pjb> = (cons base-dir (cons subdir relative-path-components))
[16:56:37] <bremner> yes, that might work, although it's a bit more natural to have the dir as a list, e.g. from (pathname-directory (ensure-directory-pathname arg))
[16:56:59] <bremner> since I want to end up with a list to pase to make-pathname
[16:57:18] <bremner> s/pase/pass/
[17:14:16] <pjb> bremner: yes, pathname-directory is a list.  Prefixed with :absolute or :relative too…
[17:17:12] <pjb> bremner: and you can always define your own "language" or utility:  (defun addel (list element) (append list (list element)))  so: (addel dir name)
[17:17:51] <pjb> bremner: how nicer than (addel dir name) could it be?
