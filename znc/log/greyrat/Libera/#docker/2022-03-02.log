[02:10:02] <VSpike> Hi. Is the rule that a docker container exits when PID 1 exits?
[02:11:32] <VSpike> If so, if you have a situation where PID 1 doens't forward signals and we have other processes there that are not attached to a TTY or sharing a PGID or anything else that might make them get cleaned up, what happens to those processes when the container exits? Do they get SIGKILL'd?

[04:57:28] <tianon> (other than that, Docker doesn't keep a history of what tags an image had in the past, except maybe incidentally in the daemon logs depending on the log level?)

[06:18:14] <tabakhase> debian slim has builds for pretty much anything - even risc if you go to unstable :D
[06:19:39] <tabakhase> and while its "like 10x the size of alpine" - its still just 30mb, so neglectable 
[06:20:05] <fikran> I'm new'ish to docker. Is there a way to take out a build artifact from a container?
[06:20:09] <fikran> I am using a container only for building.
[06:20:31] *** Joins: tsal (~tsal@user/tsal)
[06:20:32] <tabakhase> fikran "docker run ... cat file > outfile" in a pinch 
[06:21:14] <tabakhase> (with --rm s its gonski after) - you can also "start it with a dummy comamnd, then use 'docker cp' then stop it" - thats the more official way i guess :D
[06:22:04] <tabakhase> but the "clean" way is that "likely you shouldnt use a build then" - as in, you may have a dockerfile to setup tooling, but "producing your result" is then more a container job
[06:22:11] <bn_work> fikran: multi-stage builds, ie: copy only what you need from one layer to next
[06:22:41] <bn_work> fikran: oh, you want to just copy it out?  or reduce the image size?
[06:23:57] <tabakhase> think, dockerfile installs compiler, while "me doing a build" later on is actually a "docker run --rm -v $PWD:/src builder bash -c 'cd /src && build'  (simplyfied)
[06:23:58] <bn_work> tabakhase: I still want to know how to copy damn files into a docker volume on DD for Mac M1, apparently it's a black art
[06:24:03] <bn_work> lol
[06:24:10] <fikran> nah, I'd say copy it out and use it in another container.
[06:24:52] <tabakhase> "use it in another container." - no need to copy then, "COPY --from=imagename /bla /bla" should do
[06:25:57] <tabakhase> (this does not pull, so you have to manually-pull or coordinate "build order" outside of docker if both images are "yours")
[06:33:28] <bn_work> it's frustrating to no end that on every OS, the volume location is different, but I guess that's a result of Docker trying to hide that fact.  Being on M1 doesn't make things any easier... but I'm confused why M1 requires a separate DD arch build when M1 Macs come with Rosetta2.  Wouldn't that avoid a lot of the compatibility issues https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/#known-issues & 
[06:33:28] <bn_work> https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/troubleshoot/#known-issues ?  I guess perhaps there's a hesitancy to depend on Rosetta2 as Apple did eventually pull Rosetta1?  
[06:36:20] <tabakhase> i dont even see this whole page talking about volumes, so i got no clue what your issue even is :D - but im also neither a m1 user, nor even a mac user, andf heck, not even a docker-desktop user :D
[06:36:55] <bn_work> tabakhase: are you talking about the SO link I shared earlier?
[06:37:08] <bn_work> haha
[06:37:13] <bn_work> lucky you!
[06:38:38] <tabakhase> so? no, just the know-issues from a moment ago  (and i do not doubt that something may be very broken there ;-) )
[06:39:15] <tabakhase> no stack link in my backlog it seems *thinking*

[06:45:33] <bn_work> > <bn_work> ok... not the answer I was looking for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38532483/where-is-var-lib-docker-on-mac-os-x but ugh... I guess that's because on Mac OS(X) it's all done in a (HyperKit?) VM
[06:45:33] <bn_work> > <bn_work> ok, I'm able to see volumes via the `nsenter` technique mentioned in https://stackoverflow.com/a/65645462 but _how do I copy files INTO the volume from the host_??

[06:47:06] <tabakhase> well /var/lib/docker is "off limits" anyhow - just like using the docker0 iface to peek into the defaultbridge is ;-)

[06:50:09] <bn_work> obviously this is something that people want to be able to do though
[06:51:35] <tabakhase> note that "its what they think they need", not actually "what they want todo" in there...
[06:51:45] <tabakhase> xyproblem and all very much ;-)
[06:52:53] <tabakhase> and like, when you HAVE a literall "docker cp" command - and can use _every_container_in_the_world_ to list/view contents - what more on earth does one want? ;-)
[06:54:08] <tabakhase> meanwhile its "lucky" if your host is just running the local-volume driver and almost "an accident" that you can even access it (ideally it would be more isolated tbh ;D)

[07:01:47] <bn_work> tabakhase: `docker cp` only copies between container & local FS, so I guess one would then need to copy it from within the container to the volume?
[07:02:50] <tabakhase> the target inside the container can already be that volume -- but yes, to "prefill a new volume" for say restoring /var/lib/mysql or such youd need to doublestepp that with a helper container

[14:56:54] <tabakhase> _ohm unless you followed some oldass tut to setup a ciserver or such its kinda unlikely to end up with a open http port for the docker-api... - for anything other than "via .sock" one would use http_S_ (what works with client-certificates, so "super secure") --- and these days, one would likely just use the ssh-dailer (DOCKER_HOST=ssh://...)

[16:00:50] <wez> wasn't ssl deprecated years ago?
[16:00:55] <tabakhase> then you likely just dont have any certs (given the cert it returns actually is valid in your brwser or such for example)

[16:03:50] <tabakhase> dob1 afaik "not there", as FROM gets replaced with "what the from actually was"

[16:58:50] <seb_> Hi guys, I'm using docker-compose to put up a mongo replica set, 3 containers, plus a container for the app. For the mongo containers I'm trying to build an image and use that image in the other 2 docker-compose services. Currently is building the image but how the other two can reuse it? Can I tag it and use `image: blah:this`?

[18:05:18] <tabakhase> asside that, yes a dockerfile always has to start with a FROM - and be it FROM scratch (whats an internal dummy ;-) )   ((with the exception of ARG if used in the FROM i guess :P)
[18:05:41] <Tach> tabakhase my file do, my imagebuilder depends on a format, that's why
[18:05:45] <tabakhase> after that its just top to bottom, so obvs. you need to have a stage before the other that uses its result
[18:06:31] <Tach> when you copy a file from another image only I would say it does not matter what the order is

[23:55:09] <programmerq> TomyWork: no, dockerd gets its proxy information from its env vars. When I worked for a company that had different proxies depending on whether I was at a company location or on the VPN, I ended up running a proxy locally that could dynamically detect where to send traffic (direct or another proxy). I could configure my stuff to always use this local proxy and it would kind of do the correct thing
[23:55:12] <programmerq> without needing to restart stuff even if I moved my laptop or change VPN connection status.

[23:56:42] <TomyWork> ah, crap. no WPAD support in docker either, so I'm screwed unless I do the same
[23:56:55] <programmerq> iirc, it was essentially a socat instance that would listen and then pipe the connection to a script called by the socat exec connector. That shell script would implement the logic-- it'd detect what proxies were available and whether it would need to use one and then it'd exec another socat instance that would direct the traffic appropriately.
[23:57:15] <programmerq> is wpad the microsoft proxy auto detect stuff? I think that shell script may have pulled in that info to do the detection
[23:57:51] <programmerq> it was an internal project and I've not seen an open source equivalent out in the wild-- only heard mentions of similar custom efforts.
[23:57:51] <TomyWork> yeah. it's useful, even if a bit daft
