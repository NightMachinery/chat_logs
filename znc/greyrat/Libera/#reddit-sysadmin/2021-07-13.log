[06:31:02] <e1> Been burned one too many times lol but it was released in nov it should be fine
[06:31:30] <signofzeta> They've already announced macOS 12, and Adobe still hasn't fully caught up to macOS 11.

[07:55:26] <xe0n> nah
[07:55:29] <csws> phew
[07:57:17] <A-KO> hey xe0n
[07:57:24] <xe0n> hey A-KO
[07:57:34] <A-KO> I wonder what would happen if I turned on logging all LDAP queries on the most heavily used domain controller at work
[07:57:35] <A-KO> lol
[07:57:55] <csws> do that and disable event log rotation
[07:57:58] <xe0n> lol thats like a year or whatever ago when the LDAPS stuff was coming in and it was recommended to turn logging on for periods of a time
[07:57:58] <csws> :D
[07:59:02] <csws> used to have this happen on the PDC an alarming amount of times at my last job
[07:59:21] <csws> there was no log rotation so it would just fill up the C: drive and break event logging altogether
[07:59:27] <csws> even if you cleaned the drive after it wouldn't log anything until you rebooted
[08:00:55] <xe0n> admin error?
[08:00:57] <xe0n> think so
[08:01:43] <csws> if you open the event properties and set it to "Do not overwrite events"
[08:01:53] <csws> the AD SME did that
[08:01:54] <csws> no idea why
[08:02:06] <csws> like we had snare.. though that broke a lot as nobody did any maintenance on that
[08:02:26] <csws> but we also had an on prem ATA had moved most of the DCs to azure ATP

[08:39:29] <nojeffrey> Does a dhcp relay agent talk layer2/broadcast to the DHCP server? Or is that done over IP?
[08:42:22] <xe0n> yes e1

[08:44:10] *** Joins: silentfury (~anubis@user/silentfury)
[08:44:33] <xe0n> nojeffrey: well the dhcp relay is typically handing off the request to the dhcp server, it gets one, and then hands it back to the device, soooo i dont know the definate answer, but i would suspect over IP since its not broadcasting to the dhcp server itself
[08:44:35] <xe0n> whats the context?
[08:44:59] <xe0n> got a firewall in the way of a relay agent working or something?

[08:49:19] <e1> still, feels weird.
[08:49:32] <e1> i havent had to install something liek that for a while
[08:50:06] <xe0n> i install them as part of the SOE, all supported versions
[08:50:20] <xe0n> i wrote a installer awhile back that'll go download the latest supported builds and install them during the task sequence
[08:50:31] <xe0n> or you can tell it to download them and yeah save a couple of min off the download
[08:51:58] <e1> heh that sounds pretty handy
[08:52:12] <e1> i dont even think of the distributables. Normally just handled with package manager
[08:52:16] <e1> windows it weird
[08:53:18] <xe0n> well 9\10 if an installer needs them, it'll do a search on your machine first, chances are they're installed already, carries on, otherwise it'll download them, or throw up some sort of message
[08:54:04] <e1> Did you hear microsofts dropping support for windows 10 in favor of windows 11

[08:58:06] <nojeffrey> xe0n ~10 vlans, only want one set of DHCP servers, we use a 3rd party for all networking, wanting to know if I should set up a VIP for these for redundancy, or if it's all broadcast/layer there is no point.
[08:59:12] <e1> well you beat it
[08:59:21] <e1> someones gonna beat it
[08:59:23] <e1> beat it

[09:00:01] <nojeffrey> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dhcp-relay-agent-in-computer-network/
[09:00:12] <nojeffrey> Relay agents receive DHCP messages and then generate a new DHCP message to send out on another INTERFACE
[09:03:21] <xe0n> yep - central dhcp server, not uncommon
[09:03:31] <xe0n> then just configure the scopes for each vlan, tell the agents to use that scope
[09:03:40] <xe0n> well should just work if configured correctly :)

[09:59:51] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> they even have it as an option for the damn sausages
[09:59:52] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[09:59:54] <CableNinja_> also its not real meat

[10:00:02] <e1> it tastes good
[10:00:06] <CableNinja_> I WANT BLOOD
[10:00:06] <e1> thats all that matters
[10:00:30] <e1> lol if you were served beyond, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference
[10:00:45] <e1> If someone gave you a beyond burger, and was like 'yeah mate beef burger get it in ya' you wouldn't know
[10:00:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> i damn well would
[10:00:51] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> because i order my shit medium-rare to rare
[10:00:59] <CableNinja_> ^
[10:01:02] <e1> yeah you dont get that kinda option here
[10:01:12] <e1> you just get a burger you dont get to specify the rarity of the pattie
[10:01:22] <sd> 08<c​ray.io> you can definitely tell. but beyond burgers are good
[10:01:37] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> e1: Guess it really depends on where you're going
[10:01:37] <e1> largely because the patties are mixes of cuts and animal so you can't go 'medium rare' without knowing whats safe
[10:01:41] <sd> 08<c​ray.io> i had one at Gotts, it was pretty tasty
[10:01:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lotta places dont give the options

[10:02:33] <e1> no clue what you're talking about CableNinja_ 
[10:02:34] <CableNinja_> if they wont let you go below medium they're using less than premium beef
[10:02:52] <e1> Or they're cutting with lamb

[10:03:48] <e1> fuck, we specifically kept it secret because we didnt want people to be able to replicate our pattie
[10:04:22] <xe0n> LAMBS ON CHAPEL
[10:04:22] <e1> We had a 'meat smith' do the blend to our spec and we blind tested the patties until we were happy and the beef/lamb combo won out. sold like hot cakes, good times.

[10:22:35] <Church> Yeah looking $350k~ for a house easy
[10:22:54] <Church> And that's only because I consider it a moral failing to pay more then that for one.
[10:23:52] <CableNinja_> heh... I've become jaded to the prices in LA.. was driving by some ocean clif-side properties, was like 'huh, wonder what those go for'. they were 'vacation homes' starting at 1.5M, and I just said to myself 'huh, thats not bad'
[10:24:29] <CableNinja_> I could never in my life afford that of course, but the fact that I've become so used to the shit prices out here that I thought 1.5M to start was 'ok' was funny to me

[10:25:21] <Church> Heh aye
[10:25:26] <e1> 1.5m cheap

[10:30:44] <CableNinja_> yeh, depending on the state of the inside it could only take 'a bit' to make it worthy, or at most another 100k
[10:31:02] <Church> Ah it sold in May anyway

[11:08:37] <sd> 10<L​_Cranston_Shadow> @JollyRgrs probably still better than those Coke machines that dispense multiple sodas out of one nozzle. Great idea, but terrible execution from my experience, since you always get traces of whatever flavor the previous user used.
[11:09:33] <CableNinja_> L_Cranston_Shadow damn things out of almost everything most of the time anyway lol
[11:09:39] <JollyRgrs> yeah, when i was doing a hard-core diet, i would have to end up doing water from fountains and i hated sharing the nozzle. i'd always run teh water for a few seconds before putting my cup under

[11:10:31] <A-KO> well, I learned a thing today
[11:10:33] <JollyRgrs> i expect the Dr. Pepper to not be "quite right" b/c coke is managing the fizzle ratios, etc... but even the other sodas are "off"
