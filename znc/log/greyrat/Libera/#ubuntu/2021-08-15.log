[00:26:44] <RedHead> sorry for the noob question: are all the packages that I can download with "apt" is safe? they are coming from ubuntu officialy?
[00:27:26] <SnoopJ> RedHead, not all of them, no. Ones that come from official ubuntu repositories (the things your system shipped with) should be fine, but they aren't rigorously examined for this property either.
[00:28:14] <SnoopJ> If you add repositories to your /etc/apt/sources.list, there's no telling what's on the other end of the URLs you add, so be careful about doing this if you ever do.
[00:29:14] <RedHead> there are only *.ubuntu.com *.canonical.com in this file
[00:29:21] <SnoopJ> right, so those are official
[00:29:34] <SnoopJ> it is possible to configure apt to look other places that have non-official files, is my point
[00:30:22] <RedHead> so in my current situation, it's safe to "apt" packages?

[00:30:31] <RedHead> thanks :)
[00:30:55] <SnoopJ> probably. Like I said, they aren't rigorously examined, so you get no guarantee of safety, but the official repositories are good
[00:31:16] <SnoopJ> they have certainly shipped software with security vulnerabilities and will certainly do it again, but this is what updates are for :)

[11:35:09] <mechanic> webchat95 no idea about swap, but yes you can just luksFormat, open them afterwards and then install ubuntu. But wouldnt it be better to just use the ubuntu installer for that? (it can just use the rest of the free space) or you can manually tell it, where to install what with what encryption etc
[11:36:16] <webchat95> can I use ubuntu installer and afterwards use luks for everything?
[11:36:32] <webchat95> I read luks only works before installation
[11:38:04] <mechanic> webchat95 the installer can encrypt the install for you
[11:38:37] <webchat95> oh I must have missed this option the first time! I will do this then. thanks!

[11:40:16] <enyc> webchat95: these days separate swap partition is not normally used (but no reason you can't have)
[11:40:42] <enyc> zram and a ''swapfile'' seems to be more normal,  not sure if ubuntu defaults to enabling the former yet

[18:11:50] <EriC^> webchat8: are you making any custom partitioning? if not you could just go back and choose erase disk and install ubuntu
[18:11:53] <TJ-> Zteam: this should be solvable with "resize2fs /dev/dm-0"
[18:12:02] <tomreyn> ravage: your suggestion to create an ESP (on a primary partition) in addition to the Ubuntu / partition (which could be an extended partition) should actually work.
[18:12:04] <TJ-> Zteam: that should ensure the file-system is the same size as the container
[18:12:19] <Swift110-mobile> good morning folks
[18:12:19] <ravage> ok lets do that then, webchat8
[18:12:46] <ravage> remove the ext4 partition. create a 300M ESP partiton
[18:13:08] <webchat8> Ravage: please i don't want to wipe my data on other partions please note ok
[18:13:09] <coconut> EriC^, he wants to re-use personal files after installation
[18:13:17] <ravage> after that create the ext4 partition with mountpoint / again with the rest of the free space
[18:13:27] <EriC^> oh i see coconut
[18:13:55] <webchat8> Click Undo all changes?
[18:14:02] <ravage> webchat8, if you only delete the one you created it will not delete anything else. but as we all said before: no backup, no mercy
[18:14:12] <ravage> yes undo should be ok
[18:14:13] <Zteam> TJ-, tomreyn nice catch guys :D
[18:15:38] <webchat8> Ok it's back to the imgur screenshot again
[18:15:42] <webchat8> https://imgur.com/a/3mw41zW
[18:15:51] <ravage> ok. the delete the partion again
[18:15:52] <tomreyn> ravage: sorry, i missed one thing: i don't know whether (a) this mainboard / BIOS and (b) ubuntu can boot off a disk with dos partition table (i do not know whether this is what we have here), with an ESP on it. in fact, i don't think you can have an ESP on a dos partition table.
[18:16:22] <ravage> we will see :)
[18:16:44] <ravage> webchat8, create the ESP partition and then your system partition
[18:16:45] <tomreyn> hmm right thats an option
[18:16:47] <webchat8> Delete sda1?
[18:16:51] <Zteam> TJ-, so the way to compare this two is to use dmsetup and compare it with the output from fsck right?
[18:17:25] <tomreyn> Zteam: it's still unclear how this (file system larger than device) happened in the first place, though
[18:17:46] <tomreyn> Zteam: especially since you mentioned you had not reized or otherwise modified it
[18:18:31] <tomreyn> webchat8: yes, delete sda1

[18:29:06] <ravage> webchat8, do you know how to get into your BIOS and change some settings?
[18:29:27] <TJ-> ravage: hold one moment. What sector does partition #1 begin at? if it is greater than 34 AND you can shrink the last partition slighlty, you can slip in a GPT alongside the MBR, and create identical partitions in the GPT to match the current MBR, to create a hybrid/protective MBR on a GPT layout :)

[18:39:36] <Zteam> TJ-, why not just use Gparted instead much more beginner friendly ? :-)
[18:40:06] <TJ-> Zteam: because Gparted moves the partition data, not just the 16 bytes that are the partition entry

[19:30:25] <tomreyn> webchat65: i think the only way you can make things work by yourself is to boot the installer into bios mode (something you need to set up on the bios setup screens or with the "boot override menu" the bios may provide). and then delete partition 1 (sda), and create a new ext4 parititon there, primary, covering the full space, starting at the beginning, and install the boot loader to /dev/sda

[20:32:00] <webchat52> F 12 i mean

[23:18:20] <webchat24> okay
[23:18:21] <TJ-> webchat24: right, so at present you've got 36GiB free - not allocated to any block device or file-system, so you can use that free space to increase the size of existing LVs, or to create new LVs for other purposes (e.g. I often create a separate LV for Videos, Sourcecode, and so on)
[23:18:26] *** Quits: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:18:53] <webchat24> i'm not sure what to do with that free space
[23:19:07] <TJ-> webchat24: for the sake of argument now let's assume your separate /home/ file-system (in /dev/mapper/MEMORIES-home) has run out of space
[23:19:24] *** Quits: lewdua (~lewdua@2001:5b0:50c6:3448:fddb:fe2f:7ca4:b845) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:19:48] <TJ-> webchat24: if this were a partition you're stuffed. But with LVM, when you have free space remaining in the VG, you can simply enlarge the LV and file-system *LIVE* (this includes the rootfs).
[23:20:17] <webchat24> the rootfs is where my kubuntu installed right?
[23:20:35] <TJ-> webchat24: you can do this now, just to see how simple it is. Let's add 1GiB to the /home/ file-system and LV: "lvextend -L +1G --resizefs MEMORIES/home"

[23:20:50] <webchat24> you mean if i installed enough programs with it's data to make the voolume full, with this unallocated space i can increase that volume later
[23:21:12] <TJ-> webchat24: yes, the OS is in MEMORIES-rootfs. Because you have MEMORIES-home separately you could install another distro in a new LV and share /home/
[23:21:19] <TJ-> webchat24: correct
[23:21:38] <TJ-> webchat24: run the command I gave you for home and you'll know what to expect
[23:22:24] <TJ-> webchat24: and if you ever reinstall, as long as you don't erase /dev/sda1 or this VG MEMORIES, your files in /home/ would not be touched by the installer
[23:22:39] <webchat24> extended!

[23:23:34] <TJ-> without the + you'd be saying I want this absolute size
[23:23:55] <TJ-> webchat24: correct, the free space is part of the VG MEMORIES
[23:24:16] <webchat24> it's shown under devices
[23:24:47] <TJ-> webchat24: I use free space to be able to create and destroy temporary virtual machines, as I did for this kubuntu test

[23:30:18] <TJ-> webchat24: correct, that free space can be used for what needs it rather than - with partitions - having to pre-guess where you'll need it
[23:31:17] <webchat24> but if assign them to something like (home for example)
[23:31:22] <webchat24> and they run out of space
[23:31:27] <webchat24> i can't get them back as flexible
[23:31:43] <webchat24> so it's one time use unless i create them for a test purpose lik eyou did?
[23:31:59] <webchat24> as a new partition
[23:32:07] <webchat24> use then delete again
[23:32:15] <TJ-> if you used up all the free space by assigning it to LV(s) then you'd have to /shrink/ an LV (if the file-system inside it had free space) in order to give space back to the VG :)
[23:32:41] <webchat24> i seee
[23:32:56] <TJ-> webchat24: we also have "lvreduce" for that situation - to reduce a file-system it has to be unmounted though, so can't be done live on the rootfs (has to be done from a liveISO boot)
