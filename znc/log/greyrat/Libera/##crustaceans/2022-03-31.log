[00:52:48] <epilys> dmc, I can never remember birthdays and holidays so I just buy presents all the time for everyone close to me at random times through the year. It seems to have a good reception
[00:53:09] <mgdm> I had a look into doing astrophotography recently and it seems all the things I want to do end up being expensive
[00:53:13] <dmc> lol
[00:54:27] <epilys> photography in general is super expensive, I imagine astro- is many times more
[00:55:14] <epilys> your hobby eventually ends up being gear hunting/collecting
[00:55:46] <mgdm> yeah, I already have a couple of hobbies that trend in that direction. I should take up something that doesn't get expensive or involve computers
[00:56:10] <gwozniak> I do the astro- thing, but not with computers (or too many of them, I guess)
[00:56:29] <gwozniak> My mount has a computer in it, as does the camera
[00:56:42] <gwozniak> But I don't hook up my laptop
[01:41:41] <mgdm> I was thinking about all the image processing I'd no doubt end up doing afterwards
[01:43:48] <kline> epilys, whats the status of meli just now?
[01:44:11] <kline> im doing my quarterly wail and teeth-gnash at thunderbird and id like to use it

[01:47:28] <Brekkjern> Oh yeah! Share dividends! $0.34 USD! Am gonna get rich :P
[01:53:50] <gwozniak> mgdm: post processing is a must for astrophotography
[01:54:00] <gwozniak> It's the part I really need to learn
[01:54:28] <gwozniak> But I like looking through the scope too much to bother with the processing part these days :)
[02:01:30] <mgdm> Fair! I should consider just getting a scope to look at things rather than overcomplicating everything again

[03:07:42] <martian67> seems a lot of wishful thinking is going on
[04:43:08] <gwozniak> mgdm: I got a 110mm apochromatic refractor as a bit of a compromise.  It's good for viewing, reasonably portable, and good for photography.  And really, it's the mount that you need for photography
[04:43:50] <gwozniak> Expensive, but worth it for me
[05:07:43] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: i used the nickel telescope at lick observatory once, i could see bright colors in planetary nebula, that was pretty cool
[05:08:07] <ngoldbaum> but yeah for the most part naked eye observing is a little disappointing even with a really nice telescope
[05:08:38] <ngoldbaum> i have a fried who used one of the VLT telescopes with an eyepiece

[10:57:59] <epilys> I'll fix the dark mode thing, thanks :)
[10:58:23] <kline> cool
[10:58:49] <epilys> run the master branch if you want to check it out
[10:58:50] <kline> i remember trying it a long time ago and it choked on the imap mailboxes i have on account of their ludicrous size
[10:59:01] <kline> possibly my small ram at the time was a contributing factor
[10:59:08] <kline> it was early days then though
[11:03:05] <epilys> I made the huge mistake from the get go to fetch envelope details (not the entire email) of a mailbox at once instead of doing lazy loading ðŸ¤” and now it needs a big refactoring to do that
[11:03:39] <kline> the biggest issue i think is that i have a 7000 mail imap folder
[11:03:57] <kline> actually i lied, its 25000

[11:12:47] <epilys> Move to an Archived mailbox, maybe?
[11:13:21] <epilys> btw one of my INBOXes is 22617 and meli isn't slow with that
[11:14:36] <kline> they are in archived mailboxes

[11:54:22] <river> for the past 10 years its just been 1 joke over and over: go doesnt hav generics lol
[11:55:01] <epilys> harelang doesn't have genercs!
[11:55:32] <river> it only matters when go doesn't have it
[11:55:40] <river> i keep hearing this argument
[11:55:51] <gerikson> "lol no generics"
[11:56:20] <river> ill paste it

[11:56:44] <epilys> ship in a bottle
[11:56:45] <river> "google is one of the small handful of companies on the planet for whom the economics of buying infrastructure and the economics of hiring developers are reversed. for most companies, developers are an extremely scarce and valuable resource, while infrastructure is a commodity. but when you run at google scale, just throwing more hardware at it is no longer the solution to all your problems,
[11:56:47] <river> and the kind of hardware you need is no longer a commodity. So instead, they have to make their programmers a commodity, and a dumbed-down language like Go fits that goal perfectly. Google doesn't need a lot of prodigy level code; they need stupid code that works and can be made to do anything by throwing more cheap devs at it."
[11:56:58] <river> epilys: i saw that, really nice!
[11:57:25] <river> the above is basically what I keep hearing
[11:57:28] <river> and I don't buy it
[11:57:38] <river> it doesn't make sense to me
[11:57:49] <river> if someone manages to 'dumb down' programming, and make it easy.. that's a good thing
[11:58:35] <river> this isn't remotely true though. implementing a complex system in go is basically exactly as hard as doing it in another language. when you are doing anything remotely interesitng, it's the problem domain not the language you use that is the difficult part.
[11:58:41] <gerikson> river: that quote is really really dumb
[11:59:21] <river> I guess people who like PL and understand some basics like types feel personally insulted by go or something
[11:59:49] <river> (but also don't care about the 99 other languages that don't have advanced hi tech tools for some reason?)
[12:00:21] <gerikson> they're personally insulted becauase they didn't get a job at Google and go is so easy
[12:00:37] <river> oofff :P
[12:00:42] <gerikson> just a guess
[12:00:51] <river> yeah now that you mention it, that fits
[12:01:04] <gerikson> that Pike quote everyone keeps trotting out? it's perfectly reasonable
[12:01:11] <gerikson> except it targets CS grads
[12:01:14] <river> oh yeah
[12:01:17] <gerikson> who get relly triggered
[12:01:54] <epilys> are programmers the only trade that gets so angry/passionate about the tools of the trade?
[12:02:11] <river> i think they are a bit pathological
[12:02:30] <epilys> i don't see carpenters complaining about saws online
[12:02:52] <river> I believe it's because we struggle so much, because the stuff we have to work with is so terrible
[12:03:02] <river> we're used to it being way way harder than it actually needs to be
[12:03:07] <gerikson> I think programmers vaslty overrate how much the choice of *language* affects productivity
[12:03:19] <river> so people are desperate for a cargo cult to latch onto to save the day
[12:03:34] <river> but yeah, like gerikson says, we're sinking no matter what
[12:03:39] <epilys> ye it's some kind of weird tribalism
[12:03:59] <epilys> i get that PLs have pros and cons but they're tools not the goal
[12:04:15] <river> people lose sight of that too much
[12:04:52] <gerikson> als, the people who are actually *making stuff work* may not be the ones arguing online
[12:05:02] <gerikson> just saying
[12:06:22] <epilys> ye, selection bias
[12:06:25] <river> yes :)
[12:06:57] <river> i think the majority of the arguing online people are the beginners who are just learning things for the first time (but obvi. not presenting themselves that way)
[12:07:05] <epilys> i just thought someone broke into my house because I heard banging noises from the living room but turned out to be the robot vacuum doing its scheduled run but banging on the walls loudly

[15:03:52] <river> why is clean room reverse engineering a thing
[15:03:56] <river> its clearly a loophole
[15:04:05] <river> why havent they just closed the loophole, or allowed non-clean room?
[15:04:47] <edk> is it a loophole though?
[15:05:30] <edk> the reason it exists is that you can't copyright an idea
[15:07:06] <river> i would consider it a loophole
[15:10:29] <edk> when you reverse engineer a thing you aren't automatically violating its copyright
[15:10:43] <edk> but you may have a very hard time proving that you didn't copy it if you end up with exactly the same implementation
[15:11:24] <edk> clean room reverse engineering is just a technique that leaves you with documentary evidence that you didn't copy

[19:06:04] <river> i can just delete cookies if i care
[19:06:05] <gwozniak> river: then you need to take on the economic situation, not the Internet
[19:06:23] <gerikson> what gwozniak said
[19:06:26] <gwozniak> Once the money showed up, that's when things got worse
[19:06:31] <edk> i mean... i like being able to not give consent

[19:06:51] <edk> if you're ok with being tracked you can just agree to it. god knows they make it easy enough
[19:06:54] <edk> but i shouldn't have to
[19:07:07] <gwozniak> for the record, I hate that tracking stuff too
[19:07:15] <river> edk: no that isn't the point
[19:07:28] <river> havint to click agree (or click disagree) is the problem
[19:11:05] <edk> reading this again i feel like it should be required reading in schools
[19:11:20] <edk> i'd submit it to lobsters if i didn't disapprove of political stuff
[19:14:57] <gwozniak> I'll read it again tonight.  Maybe even bookmark it this time...

[20:51:40] <gerikson> posting that neovim rant lost me karma ;)
[20:51:48] <Brekkjern> Deserved :P
[20:51:49] <gerikson> I don't even use any vim!
[20:52:04] <gerikson> RIP my 12,705
[20:52:21] <Brekkjern> I didn't say you did
[20:52:25] <Brekkjern> :P
[21:12:42] <epilys[m]> gerikson: you sinned and were punished
[21:25:46] <edk> i didn't downvote it but i'm not surprised

[22:44:39] <drakonis> i wonder if it got posted on hn

[22:45:17] <drakonis> it did

[22:52:13] <epilys> yeah
[22:52:19] <epilys> check the submission history
[22:52:47] <epilys> i've noticed because that acccount always beat me to posting my links to hn

[22:54:41] <buttsbot> Generics can make your Go code slower | Lobsters
[22:54:52] <river> golang causes comments like this even AFTER they added generics
[22:55:05] <river> there's no point giving these people an inch
[23:03:32] <companion_cube> it's technically correct, but also funny in how it misses the point
[23:03:38] <companion_cube> like, sure, keep your monormophized code
[23:03:48] <companion_cube> but generics are faster than interface{}, which is what people use
[23:07:36] <Brekkjern> I wonder if they are aware that writing assembly can be faster than writing code in other languages too, and that is proof that the language designers hate their users
[23:12:21] <ngoldbaum> epilys: my favorite is that guy is literally using yahoo pipes to do it and thatâ€™s his ad for modern-day yahoo pipes
[23:12:34] <ngoldbaum> what if rest APIs were awful spaghetti visual programming
[23:13:12] <Brekkjern> You are joking, but I know of some software that is practically that
[23:13:21] <epilys> oh damn, so the reposting is marketing?
[23:13:27] <Brekkjern> It's not made for it, but some people insist on using it for that kind of shit.
