[02:25:07] <DarthGandalf> MDingas-: what kind of event-based system? The whole ZNC is event-based, where some events come from timers

[02:26:07] <MDingas-> wouldn't you then agree that detecting automatically that a user disconnected from znc would be better than probing every N seconds?
[02:28:51] <DarthGandalf> That is not what it does
[02:29:17] <DarthGandalf> It starts the timer when user disconnected
[02:29:30] <DarthGandalf> Then, if user didn't reconnect in N seconds, it sends AFAY
[02:29:32] <DarthGandalf> AWAY
[02:30:20] <keir> the problem is if you disconnect and then connect again means unnecessary /awaying

[19:48:22] <kryten> Yeah, I'd also appreciate the Clientbuffer module being included in the ZNC base, so it doesn't regularly get forgotten on upgrades to the latter.  However, I still think it'd be more intuitive if on missing or non-matching client identifiers, it'd just send the whole buffer rather than nothing as it does now.

[21:49:13] <Koragg> as a feature suggestion (seen on other bouncers), could there be a way to mark clients connected as "passive"? a passive client would not effect the AWAY status set e.g. by simple_away . this could be used e.g. to have a logging bot/script always connected, while not interfering with the away status. or does such an option already exist as a third party module?
[21:49:51] <Koragg> another use-case would be to just "peek in" through the znc and not "alert" those who track away nicks (e.g. many clients color nicks that are AWAY differently in their nicklist)

[23:13:10] <keir> jcbjoe2021: check your prices for 24hours/day usage
[23:14:05] <keir> jcbjoe2021: you will need to be ready to do some hardening as well. such as setting up a firewall, etc. because the server will be exposed to the internet and son't come pre-hardened
