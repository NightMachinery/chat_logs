[19:22:44] <webchat90> tomreyn: thanks for the suggestion.  The dell usb adapter was getting picked up by the wrong driver.   I downloaded the r8152 driver source from realtek, pasted in ID 413c:b097 into the appropriate locations in the .c file and compiled / installed the new module.  After reboot it still gets a crazy name with the mac address in it, but network
[19:22:45] <webchat90> manager will work with it now.
