[00:13:38] <tech_exorcist> the INTEROPERABILITY section in the gpg(1) man page says that By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP preferences system that will always do the right thing and create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP program they use", but can the same be said for the keys and subkeys?
[00:14:48] <tech_exorcist> if someone who may be able to answer missed my previous messages: when creating a signing keypair and adding a signing subkey to it, all using gpg 2.2.27 with libgcrypt 1.8.8 on Devuan Chimaera (and possibly on other operating system/gpg/libgcrypt combinations), does not using the --openpgp flag have any effect on compatibility with other implementations of OpenPGP?

[11:47:27] <ede> come on....
[11:47:43] <ede> now what is a key and what is a certificate then?
[11:48:18] <ede> gnupg.org docs are more confusing than anything else.

[11:53:00] <ede> 2nd lists some text files, doesn't say what it is, 1st uses commands on files without providing links where i could download them (namely the sig file)
[11:54:08] <ede> i do have some .sig files here, something binary, also some .asc files, looks like the big text block in the 2nd link, but much shorter and with different text
[11:54:17] <ede> so i can't even say it is the samy

[12:23:22] <ede> >  This means that the signature is valid and that you trust this key (either you signed it or someone you trusted did).

[12:27:03] <hnj> then tell your gpg installation that you do and it will but I don’t see that even being necessary …
[12:27:30] <ede> it has a long history of failing getting normal people involved in the first place, just because of such things

[13:07:18] <ede> i see no logic in when a .sig file is used and when .asc
[13:07:21] <ede> ?
[13:07:58] <hnj> you have not told gpg that you are certain the key really belongs to the person that is mentioned in the key. that’s what gpg is warning you about.
[13:09:08] <hnj> and you can not really be certain until you have met them in person or verified using an already established authenticated, secure channel
[13:09:51] <ede> so the security chain is naturally broken and worthless anyway?
[13:10:09] <ede> why using signing of downloads at all then?
[13:10:26] <hnj> it depends whom you trust
[13:11:02] <hnj> do you trust the website you got that key from (enough)? then you can tell gpg that you trust that key and it will be fine …
[13:11:52] <hnj> well, terminology is a bitch in security generally and gpg in particular /-: not "trust" but "verified"
[13:12:02] <ede> how this. to check A i need B. to check B i need C. to check C i need D. downloading the .asc with the .tgz is like getting B. but if ensuring the person is the one is like getting D and i can't, what do i even win with getting the .asc file?
[13:13:14] <ede> i use gpg every few months, i'm really no expert....
[13:13:41] <hnj> where do you anchor your trust? that’s the question this really boils down to AFAIU … and that’s one of the fundamental problems of security /-:
[13:13:50] <ede> download tgz, download asc, spend hours on finding out how to check tgz with asc and how to --import
[13:14:00] <ede> don't assume i will remember any of this in 2 weeks.
[13:14:21] <ede> yeah, WOT is dead.
[13:14:24] <hnj> win with the .asc: that you really got the file the person doing that release intended you to.
[13:14:39] <ede> sha would do it without all the hassle
[13:14:48] <hnj> sha?
[13:15:10] <ede> sha256 usually, though i see no reason not to use sha512
[13:15:25] <ede> unlikely 2 different files would have the same checksum
[13:16:18] <hnj> oh, you mean a checksum? no, that’s not cryptographically secured, that just helps against file corruption, not against malicious tampering, i.e. attacks

[13:33:56] <ede> hnj: i guess https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2152126.The_Official_PGP_User_s_Guide but now i just remember Bruce Schneier who was one of the people i discovered very early on the web and who definitely should have something related.
[13:34:57] <ede> debian, devuan, and also devian it seems
[13:36:54] <derpadmin>   hnj : I am well aware... I like to have sane default in things
[13:37:14] <derpadmin> default is systemd
[13:37:36] <ede> i thought to have read "sane"? ;)
[13:37:38] <hnj> in some distros, yes
[13:37:44] <hnj> in others not
[13:38:04] <derpadmin> most top distros use systemd...
[13:38:32] <hnj> what’s your point?
[13:38:53] <ede> on distrowatch ubuntu+debian are on 6+7. #2 is EndeavourOS, never heard of it...
[13:39:28] <derpadmin>  hnj: my point is, I like to install an os default that I can understand a maximum
[13:39:43] <ede> also the startup thing (assuming systemd is there to replace sysV init) is just one thing. package management and support also are crucial.
[13:41:19] <ede> gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
[13:41:27] <ede> let's just assume i know it does
[13:41:30] <ede> what now?
[13:42:28] <hnj> mhm, would be nice if we could keep complexity down …
[13:43:05] <hnj> ede: then everything is good. you can tell gpg about that by signing (certifying) that key but you don’t have to.
[13:43:28] <hnj> bbl, hf
[13:43:44] <ede>        gpg -se -r Bob file
[13:43:44] <ede>               sign and encrypt for user Bob
[13:43:46] <ede> this?
[13:44:53] <ede> i don't even dare to search for "sign" in the manpage
[13:48:49] *** Joins: duxsco (~Thunderbi@user/duxsco)
[15:31:34] <hnj> ede: no, gpg --edit-key <some key identifier> sign
[15:35:04] <ede> some part of it opens a gpg shell gmm
[15:35:06] <ede> hmm
[15:35:26] <hnj> yes, --edit-key
[15:35:30] *** Quits: boxframes_ (~Saloframe@2607:9000:2000:15::a45d) (Quit: Leaving)
[15:35:40] <hnj> that’s an interactive command
[15:36:17] <ede> no idea what to do there
[15:36:34] <hnj> 'sign'
[15:37:21] <ede> sign = write your name with a rollerball on a piece of paper
[15:37:32] <ede> <<< not crypto expert
[15:39:05] <ede> well not paper these days. my bank has a flat thing where i sign with a plastic "pen"
[15:40:41] *** Joins: GNUHacker (~foobar@fsf/member/GNUHacker)
[15:40:47] <ede> do i have to buy such a thing and create a crypto account somewhere?
[15:47:23] <hnj> d-: no, it’s an electronic signature
[16:01:15] <ede> so i really have to create a gpg account first?
[16:01:56] <bremner> what do you mean by a "gpg account"? gpg is software, not a service you sign up for
[16:02:48] <ede> "electronic signature"
[16:03:06] <ede> my real name or what?
[16:03:48] <ede> and what sense would this even make on a user account on a Linux installation running on a home computer?
[16:04:25] <hnj> no. a cryptographic process. you need a pgp key to do that.
[16:04:48] <ede> a key like all these developers have?
[16:04:57] <hnj> yes
[16:05:28] <ede> but why? all of this happens in MY user profile on MY computer
[16:05:58] <ede> so if i say "i trust this developer key" it should be fine
[16:06:21] <ede> why do i have to sign this crypto in my own profile for my own personal use?
[16:06:37] <hnj> to tell gpg that you trust this key
[16:06:56] <ede> gpg --trust-this-key <key>, done
[16:07:32] <ede> if somebody can type this in my profile here then i really have other problems
[16:07:36] <hnj> feel free to implement that! sounds like a huge improvement IMHO
[16:07:59] <ede> sure, because gpg would accept my code...
[16:08:43] <hnj> I don’t know … if not: feel free to fork it! beauty of free software (:
[16:09:31] <ede> i prefer medics to make surgeries, teachers to teach, architects to plan buildings, and guess what. professional developers to write crypto software.
[16:10:50] <ede> there's a troll on youtube-dl's github trying to get everyone to use his fork (remember, yt throttling it now and not actively maintained atm for months) and i really can resist it.
[16:11:32] <hnj> yeah, me too. don’t have to be professional, as in "profession", job, paid, but especially regarding crypto they should know what they are doing …
[16:11:43] <ede> i wouldn't even fork nano, let alone gpg. asides from that i have problems already understanding the user side of the GH UI.
[16:12:28] <ede> though job may help doing things on a daily base which helps keeping the quality
