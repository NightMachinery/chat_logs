[00:02:56] <LjL> i would be
[00:03:09] <LjL> i would also be entirely confused by which time "12 pm" actually is, but that's probably just me ;(
[00:03:22] <LjL> some styleguides propose to use "noon" or "midnight" for those slightly confusing times
[00:04:11] <awmv> I changed it to `Anything after 12 am from Monday to Friday would work for me.` now. I meant 12 am :D
[00:04:50] <awmv> Anything, after 12 am from Monday to Friday, would work for me.
[00:11:11] *** Tobbi__ is now known as Tobbi
[00:16:17] <LjL> don't use that comma
[00:17:07] <LjL> generally when you *describe* something that is already specified, you can surround the description in commas, but when the description is itself a *specification* (anything? not anything: anything from x to y) you avoid the comma
[00:17:31] <LjL> The car, which was red, was very fast.
[00:17:39] <LjL> Which car crashed? The car which was red crashed.
[00:17:50] <LjL> (okay, usually you'd just say "the red car" there, but)
[00:20:44] <awmv> Then It's Grammarly's fault
[00:24:17] <awmv> I sent the mail without commas now
[00:24:25] <awmv> Thank you for the advice

[05:15:30] <FLHerne> I wonder if they're using [] for omissions
[05:15:44] <FLHerne> (I'd use [...] normally)
[05:16:49] <Me-me> [] Is used to make a quote grammatically correct or more communicative without suggesting that it is given verbatim.
[05:16:54] <FLHerne> Also, are you sure it's not a missing-character box because they used some symbol for a footnote or comment that got lost in document formatting

[05:17:31] <Me-me> Empty?
[05:17:44] <FLHerne> That's what they say

[05:18:01] <FLHerne> Nor have I that I remember
[05:23:18] <twb> [] is used to show a change made by an editor, i.e. not a verbatim quote
[05:23:25] <twb> … is used to indicate an elision.
[05:23:37] <Me-me> Yeah but what about empty []?

[22:33:47] <CuriosTiger> In Florida, it really can be. :P
[22:34:24] <blkshp> Day of the Triffids!
[22:34:43] <huf> best part is when they come back and you have to cut down the shoots every year
[22:34:51] <paul424> So maybe we could have conversation about invasive plants .... donno what he is curious about :P
[22:35:27] <blkshp> Ok, first question, what's the meaning of the call~?

[22:36:20] <CuriosTiger> but it involves fire.
[22:36:26] <CuriosTiger> and I'm not sure it'd be permanent.

[22:46:41] <CuriosTiger> I find translating hard, even between languages I'm fluent in.
[22:46:54] <huf> it's a nearly completely separate skill you build on top of knowing two languages
[22:46:59] <CuriosTiger> Things that sound natural in one language can come off clunky in the other, so translation is far more than just substituting words.

[23:14:10] <paul424> "The writer, Eric Roth, departed substantially from the book. We flipped the two elements of the book, making the love story primary and the fantastic adventures secondary. Also, the book was cynical and colder than the movie. In the movie, Gump is a completely decent character, always true to his word. He has no agenda and no opinion about anything except Jenny, his mother and God."
