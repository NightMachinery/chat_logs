[03:58:20] <imp> hello all. I have 3 subprojects, lets say projA, projB and projC these three projects are somehow integrated but are developed by different teams. I have also a project, lets call it projZ that runs over all those projects and build docker images of them, then do many other orchestration things. In my idea, I have added projA, B and C as submodules of projZ. But seems submodule points to a arbitrary commit (the one on tree in the time I have cr
[03:58:22] <imp> eated the submodule), not the "latest" . That leads to another issue, if someone updates projA. The changes isnÂ´t reverted into projZ submodules (or at least I don't know how to do). My question is: A. is submodule the tool I need?; B. How can I do it with submodule or any other tool in git?

[04:23:34] <Jong> Maybe for branches the imperative mood makes sense. Make a branch for each to do.
[04:24:20] <Jong> but branches are created before the work, and exist during the work.  A commit is made after the changes for the commit are done.
[04:25:05] <Jong> elibrokeit  there's no such thing as a commit before making the commit.  Before the commit, it's considered a diff from HEAD

[13:34:05] <srinidhi> Hi! I think I have either goofed up in my git repo or my understanding is incomplete. I'm hoping someone could enlighten me here!
[13:34:06] <srinidhi> I'm working on a branch (feature1) and wanted to merge the master into my branch before raising a pull request in Github. I ran "git rebase master" while I was on the "feature1" branch. I could see the master changes were "on the top" of my local changes.
[13:34:35] <srinidhi> when I try to create a pull request, the commits which are already in master are still showing up in the PR. How can I avoid this?
[13:35:10] <srinidhi> did I make a mistake in running "git rebase master"? I'm reading a few posts where people recommend "git merge --no-ff master"
[13:36:03] <mgedmin> this sounds strange; git rebase master is what I always do, and it puts my changes on top of the current master
[13:36:29] <mgedmin> when you git push --force-with-ease, github's UI shows that as new commits being added
[13:36:51] <mgedmin> so in the UI it might look like you added a bunch of commits, then added a bunch of master commits, then added a bunch of the same commits you'd added before
[13:36:59] <mgedmin> but the diff should show only your changes
[13:37:38] <srinidhi> mgedmin: this is what I've done in the past. but I always work on my fork. In this project, the team has decided to use the "branch workflow" rather than forking.
[13:38:00] <srinidhi> mgedmin: in the UI of the PR, I can see the "files changed" which are already in master
[13:38:27] <srinidhi> hmm.. this is the first time I'm hearing about "git push --force-with-ease"
[13:38:39] <mgedmin> typo!  it's --force-with-lease
[13:38:43] <srinidhi> I had to do a "git push --force" and my commit history is all lost
[13:38:45] <srinidhi> oh okay
[13:38:59] <mgedmin> (it's a safety check, more or less "don't force-push if the remote has changes I haven't seen before")
[13:39:12] <srinidhi> oh okay
[13:39:44] <srinidhi> I really do not want to create a new branch from master and then cherry-pick all my commits once again!!
[13:40:03] <srinidhi> because this is the third time, I'm trying to get my changes in a Pull Request
[13:40:10] <mgedmin> does your local master match the remote master?
[13:40:15] <srinidhi> yes
[13:40:17] <srinidhi> it does
[13:40:37] <srinidhi> On branch master
[13:40:37] <srinidhi> Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

[13:43:44] <mgedmin> other things to check are maybe which branch is the github PR targeting?

[13:48:01] <srinidhi> yes - that is that I wrote. The pidgin plugin autocorrects "i" to I
[13:48:07] <mgedmin> how hlepful!
[13:48:44] <srinidhi> mgedmin: so in "git rebase -i master", can I "drop" the commits from master?
[13:49:11] <mgedmin> yes, if you see more commits than you want to have on the branch, you can delete those lines
[13:49:24] <srinidhi> ah, delete the lines. sure
[13:49:44] <mgedmin> but the fact that you're seeing them means they're not already present in your local git master branch
[13:49:55] <srinidhi> \o/ successfully rebased!!

[13:50:44] <srinidhi> mgedmin: I verified it. the commit sha is available in local master
[13:51:31] <srinidhi> so after successful rebase, "git status" is now saying:
[13:51:31] <srinidhi> Your branch and 'origin/feature1' have diverged,
[13:51:31] <srinidhi> and have 7 and 6 different commits each, respectively.
[13:52:06] <srinidhi> shall I now try "git push --force-with-lease" or "git push --force" once again?
[13:54:07] <mgedmin> that's the obvious next step, yes, although I worry about 7 vs 6
[13:54:18] <mgedmin> which branch has more commits -- origin or your local one?
[13:54:23] <srinidhi> because I removed one commit from my local branch
[13:54:26] <mgedmin> did you lose a commit, or get an extra one
[13:54:31] <srinidhi> origin has more commits
[13:54:32] <mgedmin> ah, if you intentionally removed one, it's all fine
[13:54:40] <mgedmin> a surprise removal of a commit could be a problem
[13:54:53] <mgedmin> push and may the force be with you
[13:55:22] <srinidhi> phew... things are looking good now!!
[13:55:28] <srinidhi> thank you so much, mgedmin!!

[14:48:17] <srinidhi> I want to bring down multiple PRs from Github into a local branch - for integration testing, a small demo, etc.
[14:48:17] <srinidhi> What is the best way to pull in multiple PRs into a local branch? I've Github CLI configured in case it helps
[14:48:57] *** Joins: hoochmonger (~hoochmong@user/hoochmonger)
[14:49:41] <mgedmin> hmm, note down the remotes/branch names, git fetch each of them, git merge them one by one into your new local branch?
[14:50:42] <mgedmin> I suppose you could git fetch the special PR refs (refs/origin/pull/.../head) from github and merge those
[14:51:00] <mgedmin> e.g. I have this alias in my ~/.gitconfig:
[14:51:02] <mgedmin> fetch-pull-requests = "!f() { a=${1:-*}; git fetch origin \"+refs/pull/$a/head:refs/remotes/origin/pull/$a\"; }; f"
[14:51:20] <mgedmin> so I can git fetch-pull-requests; git merge pull/123; git merge pull/456

[14:57:58] <srinidhi> I missed the "origin" from the output of "git fetch-pull-requests"
[14:58:15] <mgedmin> I don't have a good handle of when git adds that automatically
[14:58:36] <mgedmin> e.g. when you git checkout foo, and there's no local 'foo' branch, it creates one from origin/foo
[14:58:47] <Swahili> Is it possible to clone the submodules recursively with providing the access token only once?
[14:58:54] <mgedmin> maybe that's the only place where that happens
[14:59:09] <mgedmin> Swahili: I would expect git clone --recursive to work
[14:59:25] <mgedmin> does it ask multiple times?
[14:59:40] * mgedmin generally uses ssh keys for auth and has little experience with access tokens
[14:59:45] <Swahili> mgedmin: tks for looking! so instead of running the submodule, stick with git clone and pass the token?
[15:00:11] <Swahili> mgedmin: yeh, was trying to figure out a way just for this submodule case, it's actually a single submodule (repo)
[15:00:40] <Swahili> didn't want to have to set a new key pair and setup the ssh keys in the cloud service

[19:22:00] <roxlu> Hey, I've got a feature branch for which I want to make a pull request; though I know that it won't merge in the `develoment` branch (for which I want to create a pull request). What would be a good way to make sure my feature branch will nicely merge with the `development` branch before I create the pull request? Should I rebase on `origin/development` first?
[19:22:51] <ikke> yes

[19:26:14] <roxlu> ikke: thanks, should I do that simply on the feature branch, e.g: `git checkout featurebranch`  and then `git rebase origin/development` ?
[19:26:26] <ikke> roxlu: correct
[19:26:40] <ikke> you can also do: git rebase origin/development featurebranch
[19:26:46] <roxlu> ikke++ :) thanks
[19:26:47] <ikke> and make sure you run git fetch before
[19:27:01] <roxlu> yep
[19:27:26] <kek_> I have repo A and B. A contains B as a submodule. I read the code in B and made some changes (just for the sake of understanding) and then trashed those changes by checking out the original files. So if I cd into the submodule B in A and use git status it says "everythings fine". If I cd back into A and use git status I get "modified:   B (new commits)". If I run git diff in A I get https://bpa.st/raw/SFXQ Now a git log in B tells me that
[19:27:26] <kek_> 18c393 is current head and the other is some commits behind. I think that's the one when I added the submodule. I don't understand why git status in A shows me this "warning".
[19:27:26] <roxlu> what if I first create a `tmp` branch from `featurebranch` and do the rebase there. that would probably be a bit less clean?
[19:27:50] <ikke> roxlu: I would not see a benefit of doing that
[19:28:02] <roxlu> ... just in case I screw up something
[19:28:21] <ikke> roxlu: the reflog can take you back
[19:28:58] <roxlu> yeah true
[19:29:45] <roxlu> hmm I did the rebase then tried to push, but I'm getting: `Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind`
[19:29:55] *** Joins: kurtthemaker (~kurt@S010644a56e3e0ee9.cn.shawcable.net)
[19:30:26] <imMute> kek_: 'git status' inside the submodule says everythings fine because there are no modifications.  the parent repo, however, "Wants" the submod to be at a specific commit, but it's on a different one (later, since it says there are new commits)

[19:32:15] <kek_> imMute, where can I look up which commit git expects the submodule to be at and why does git care? Seems kind of wrong to me because now it seems like I have to make a commit in my main repo that is about updating the dependency.
[19:33:08] <roxlu> ikke: do you know why I get? This is the full message https://gist.github.com/roxlu/e0e6a2c8cec3bc4b78d094d1793b7bcc
[19:33:31] <roxlu> isn't the idea of rebasing that I'm not behind anymore?
[19:33:43] *** Joins: unluckyshrubbery (~unluckysh@45-19-33-188.lightspeed.livnmi.sbcglobal.net)
[19:34:22] <ikke> rebasing rewrites history, which makes it look like the remote version of the branch has commits you do not have locally
[19:34:33] <ikke> You fix this by force pushing the branch
[19:34:38] <roxlu> ah I see, does that mean I have to push with `-f` ?
[19:34:49] <kek_> imMute, so if I want to update submodule created from B (i.e. pull changes in B) I have to do "git add <submodule>" and "git commit 'updated submodule'"  kind of thing?
[19:34:53] <roxlu> or better .. `--force-with-lease `  ?
[19:34:54] <imMute> kek_: that's the point of submodules - to pull in another repo and pin a specific commit.

[19:35:07] <roxlu> oh :) sorry missed you message, ok.
[19:35:29] <imMute> kek_: yes, if you want to change which commit is "pinned" for the submodule, you have to git add/commit that change like it was any other file (mainly because that's exactly how the parent repo records the submodule)
[19:36:40] <kek_> imMute, okay thanks a lot. I see my issue now. I'm gonna reread the submodule section.

[23:49:56] <Rockwood> remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.
[23:49:59] <Rockwood> remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.
[23:50:04] <Rockwood> i am facing this issue
[23:50:14] <Rockwood> why its coming?
[23:50:32] <imMute> Rockwood: why did they remove password authentication?   probably some security concern.
[23:50:47] <Rockwood> oh
[23:50:57] <Rockwood> from where its missing?
[23:51:02] <Rockwood> for git?
[23:51:11] <imMute> Rockwood: github removed it, not git.
[23:51:19] <Rockwood> idk why they removed it
[23:51:27] <imMute> probably some security concern.
[23:51:36] <Rockwood> i don't know
[23:51:43] <Rockwood> oh
[23:51:43] <ikke> You need to create a dedicated token and use that instead of your github password
[23:51:46] <imMute> doesn't really matter why they removed it.
[23:51:54] <ikke> It's not the mechanism they removed
[23:52:01] <imMute> what ikke said.  or use SSH keys (that's what I always use)
[23:52:14] <Rockwood> how to add that?
[23:52:27] <Rockwood> i have ubuntu
[23:52:31] <Rockwood> 20
[23:52:35] <ikke> https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
[23:52:43] <imMute> https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/   yep, security.
[23:52:45] <cbreak> Rockwood: how about using ssh? :)
[23:53:03] <Rockwood> yes i am using ssh
[23:53:10] <imMute> no, you're not.
[23:53:11] <cbreak> so... no passwords needed
[23:53:19] <Rockwood> yes i am doing ssh
[23:53:20] <ikke> Rockwood: did you create an ssh keypair?
[23:53:22] <imMute> if you were using SSH, you woudln't get that error.
[23:53:28] <Rockwood> yes
[23:53:32] <Rockwood> few days back
[23:53:39] <cbreak> Rockwood: then ignore the error
[23:53:39] <mackerman> SSH on GitHub.  You can still have passwords with ssh in genearl.
[23:53:42] <cbreak> it won't affect you
[23:53:47] <ikke> Rockwood: did you add the public key to github?
[23:54:01] <Rockwood> wait i am confuse now
[23:55:01] <ikke> Rockwood: what does git remote -v return?
[23:55:10] <Rockwood>  i added a file at /home/username/.git-secrets
[23:55:23] <Rockwood> okay show the output
[23:55:28] <Rockwood> showing
[23:56:05] <Rockwood>  git remote -v
[23:56:06] <Rockwood> Cyberiaaxis     https://github.com/Cyberiaaxis/ecommerce.git (fetch)
[23:56:06] <Rockwood> Cyberiaaxis     https://github.com/Cyberiaaxis/ecommerce.git (push)

[23:56:11] <Rockwood> its coming
[23:56:13] <ikke> so that's not ssh
[23:56:15] <ikke> that's http
[23:56:22] <Rockwood> okay
[23:56:25] <ikke> If you want to use ssh, you need to change the url
[23:56:42] <ikke> but, then you also need an ssh keypair
[23:56:45] <Rockwood> how to use ssh then?
[23:56:52] <cbreak> don't type https://
[23:56:57] <Rockwood> its like dos am right?
[23:56:58] <cbreak> type ssh://git@
[23:57:03] <cbreak> no
[23:57:15] <cbreak> it is not an operating system
[23:57:30] <cbreak> it is a network protocol
[23:57:46] <ikke> Rockwood: ls ~/.ssh/id*
[23:58:30] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/LdB3c
[23:58:42] <ikke> ok, so you have a keypair
[23:59:00] <ikke> and apparently github has it as well: https://github.com/Cyberiaaxis.keys
[23:59:42] <Rockwood> so now?
[23:59:58] <ikke> Rockwood: so: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Cyberiaaxis/ecommerce.git
