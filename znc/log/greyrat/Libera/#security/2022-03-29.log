[00:00:11] <BASHitup> And one little guy on IRC with opinions does nothing to stop that
[00:00:23] <ajak> ash_worksi: unprivileged accounts/users, leakage into backups, directory traversals, anyone that might get physical access to the storage media ever
[00:00:26] <ajak> ash_worksi: lots of reasons
[00:00:33] <ghostbuster> ash_worksi: what do you mean? as opposed to in-memory? or as opposed to an encrypted file? only a handful of places data can exist
[00:00:42] <Mathisen> BASHitup,  where are you going with this ?
[00:00:53] <jaggz> <some one> google released chrome emergency patch
[00:01:05] <ash_worksi> ghostbuster: the former
[00:01:21] <BASHitup> I'm saying, with my master's degree, I can't get a job ... The commmunity rejecting me supports the numbers I just threw out there
[00:01:31] <BASHitup> So I think the good side or the supposed right side isn't for me
[00:01:32] <ajak> all chrome releases have serious security issues
[00:01:40] <ajak> there was one the other day, and there will be another tomorrow
[00:01:48] <Mathisen> BASHitup, a degree is nothing without experience
[00:01:54] <ghostbuster> ash_worksi: i guess the simplest answer is that the OS provides many ways to read a file, but reading memory is harder?
[00:01:55] <BASHitup> There you go
[00:02:02] <Mathisen> just start somewhere and work your way up
[00:02:04] <BASHitup> Right
[00:02:04] <ash_worksi> ajak: okay, so in the final reason you outlined, if that's the goal, you'd have to put your password in memory in such a way that it doesn't reveal itself (for example, using `ps`) right?
[00:02:18] <BASHitup> And those dark hackers give a shit about your opinions when they attack
[00:02:34] <BASHitup> They sit there and think, "Mathisen thinks we should have degrees. I don't have one so I'll stop."
[00:02:35] <ash_worksi> ghostbuster: I can sign on to that
[00:02:42] <BASHitup> So they can break you with one script on Github
[00:02:42] <ajak> ash_worksi: not sure what you're getting at
[00:02:43] <ghostbuster> ash_worksi: i would say that passwords in memory are _safer_ than passwords on disk, but they're still not 100% safe
[00:02:52] <BASHitup> But you'll wait until your defenders have five years of experience
[00:03:01] <BASHitup> And clearly your reasoning is working with all of the attacks
[00:03:09] <ghostbuster> BASHitup: what are your degrees in?
[00:03:12] <ajak> BASHitup: you're not going anywhere :p
[00:03:15] <BASHitup> Cybersecurity
[00:03:22] <BASHitup> I have a master's in cybersecurity
[00:03:27] <ghostbuster> and bachelors?
[00:03:38] <ash_worksi> the reason I ask at all is because I am currently using (attempting to use) docker secrets which, afaiui, (1) is encrypted outside of a container it's mounted on and (2) goes to great lengths not to be visible in `ps` and friends
[00:03:58] <ajak> docker secrets is probably better than putting secrets in some file, yeah
[00:04:00] <BASHitup> And you're not either, bud
[00:04:07] <BASHitup> With your obnoxious troll bullshit
[00:04:14] <BASHitup> I don't know you and you don't know me
[00:04:14] <ajak> BASHitup: be nice, or be gone

[00:04:40] <BASHitup> So you antognize me and tell me "you're not going anywhere," then tell me to be nice?
[00:04:45] <BASHitup> You give me the logic on that, boss
[00:04:48] <BASHitup> Break it down
[00:04:49] <ash_worksi> so, if you set a password for redis, to use redis-cli you have to pass the password to the `AUTH` command
[00:05:23] <ash_worksi> for systems like postgresql, idc, because I just use `docker exec -itu postgres <container> psql <database>`
[00:05:39] <ash_worksi> I never have to put the password in
[00:05:43] <ash_worksi> so I never really thought about it
[00:05:44] <ghostbuster> BASHitup: what kind of job are you looking for? you're not gonna get hired as a CISO with no real world experience

[00:08:03] <BASHitup> Well, at this point, anything I say that expresses dissent will result in a ban.
[00:08:14] <ghostbuster> no, you can disagree politely
[00:08:18] <BASHitup> I cannot
[00:08:18] <ash_worksi> anyway, so now I *have* to use the password on redis and I thought, "dang it, now I have to remember or keep the password in 2 places. Docker secrets and <insert password manager>"
[00:08:24] <ghostbuster> well that's on you
[00:08:24] <ajak> it's not about dissent, it's about being rude to us
[00:08:25] <BASHitup> I have no voice and should not have a voice

[00:09:39] <nebula> wow what's happening here? :/
[00:09:43] <ghostbuster> i asked what kind of jobs you've been applying for, since you indicated you're having trouble finding one in security
[00:10:05] <BASHitup> I sort of hoped that - even though this isn't the place - you all would talk me out of anything rash. But that's not happening. It's predictable.
[00:10:20] <BASHitup> I lost a 100K forensics job after my employer violated EEOC laws
[00:10:32] <BASHitup> I suffered in medical durress with piles of documentation from physicians
[00:10:38] <BASHitup> One of whom said I could do the work
[00:11:02] <BASHitup> But they fired me because, well, after all is said in donw ... Two more weeks of training diminishes a figure on an Excel sheet
[00:11:38] <jessicara> i don't think another person can talk you out of the so-called dark side
[00:11:43] <BASHitup> I am protected by ADA disabilties
[00:11:53] <catties> what kind of "rash" thing are we talking about here?
[00:11:57] <jessicara> it depends on what are willing to do
[00:12:08] <ghostbuster> how many jobs have you applied for since you were fired?

[00:12:31] <BASHitup> We are already registered
[00:12:39] <BASHitup> I have people who will contribute once it is up and running
[00:13:37] <ghostbuster> i'm sure there is no shortage of forensics contract work these days
[00:13:51] <BASHitup> I don't want to do forensic work. I don't believe in the criminal justice sytem
[00:14:02] <BASHitup> Ultimately, down the road, I want to be a pentester.
[00:14:30] <BASHitup> The only cert I want is the OSCP
[00:14:52] <Mathisen> and to get OSCP you probably want more then that. as it is realy fing hard to get
[00:15:10] <BASHitup> And judging from the work I did briefly, it's a joke. They push so many machines through their lab so quickly, that something dangerous could easily skirt by.
[00:15:10] <ghostbuster> i can't give my input on that, i haven't worked as a pentester or taken any certs
[00:15:29] <BASHitup> They're trying to process as many pieces of evidence as quickly as possible ...

[00:15:35] <ash_worksi> anyway, so I thought "I have to keep the password in 2 places" and then someone tells me, "no you have access to the password inside the container"
[00:16:22] <BASHitup> What's my real IP on here?
[00:16:38] <jessicara> you can whois yourself to see it
[00:16:42] <BASHitup> I already dd
[00:16:44] <BASHitup> *did
[00:16:50] <ghostbuster> ash_worksi: i haven't used docker secrets but i think in general, encrypted/plaintext is a more important distinction than memory/disk
[00:16:51] <Apachez> so why do you ask then?
[00:16:53] <BASHitup> I want to know if somene can find out despite my VPN
[00:16:55] <MadCamel> oscp was difficult. and didn't get me anywhere either hah
[00:16:58] <BASHitup> Wireshark won't do it
[00:17:14] <BASHitup> Because I want to know how anonymous I really am
[00:17:34] <Mathisen> ok now i dont belive your story anymore that you got degree in cybersecuity
[00:17:34] <BASHitup> If there's someone who's so skilled or knows so much, things which aren't commonly known, that they can identify me despite the VPN.
[00:17:42] <ash_worksi> ajak: so I thought, for the "anyone that might get physical access to the storage media ever" use case, if someone gains access to my account, and they can just `docker exec` on a container, then that does't really keep anything safe right?

[03:57:50] <cornguy1> What is your first step to correcting this? Push for Azure AD or get all PCs on the local AD for now and run a hybrid network

[11:05:35] <pagios>  morning guys, i am looking for a solution like microsoft SCCM but for linux, something opensource that provides some nice features. I know about ansible but that needs lot of work to get it working in an env and customize it. Do you recomend any other  tools ? Goal is to centrally patch and monitor my linux servers AND GET some visibiliy on what packages are installed, what needs to be installed, give permissiosn to certain users etc.

[15:56:00] <pagios> ok so what i want to acihive is: i boot from usb, get a minimal OS, that allows me to fetch ISO files from the internet, once downloaded, i need to dynamically load the ISO and boot from them
[15:56:04] <pagios> piou:  ^
[15:56:52] <piou> if all you want is boot from an iso obtained via the network, then pxe is what you want
[15:56:59] <piou> I mean, that's litterally what pxe is
[15:57:21] <tarzeau> unless it's apple hardware
[15:57:32] <tarzeau> or SUN SPARC or anything but intel/amd
[15:58:14] <piou> I don't remember how secure pxe is, so maybe doing so over the internet can lead to issues
[15:58:31] <piou> tarzeau: you can't pxe on apple hardware?

[15:59:06] <tarzeau> no you can't

[16:06:58] <pagios> piou:  i need to be able to remotely control a pc when it boots via usb. For example, when you pluyg a usb, you get to the boot prompt where you can load ISOs or whatever. at this stage i want to be able to dynamically get Isos for example (clamAV OS to boot and clean viruses remotely) or clonezilla to remotely backup data etc, so each is an iso and i need to load them dynamically via my remote session which should be at boot level before a
[16:06:58] <pagios>  given iso is loaded

[16:08:36] <pagios> i am remotely
[16:08:50] <piou> who's booting via usb?
[16:09:43] <piou> This feels like a very messy context, if someone is able to choose an iso to boot on what's the difficulty of telling them "choose this target which will load the remote image"?

[19:53:31] <piou> sounds like hacking them would be easier, and there have been some cases in the past of unsecure satellites
[19:53:37] <piou> No nukes needed
[19:55:00] <shad> piou: satellites don't have thrusters capacities though
[19:55:14] <shad> They orbit until they get to re-entry where they burn in the atmosphere

[19:58:06] <piou> I agree that the idea of anti-space groups having elaborate plans to destroy satellites is ludicrous (at least no evidence points in that direction) but if they were doing it they have no reason to go for the hard and expensive way, surely they can do smarter things than physically destroy satellites by throwing rocks at them
[19:58:45] <ns12> piou: Hmm... I guess you are right.
[20:01:37] <piou> If I were to attack satellites... Well, I don't know much about satellite design but I expect to find two categories of satellites : imaging ones and communication ones. In the first case I think pointing a good laser down their lens may be enough to make them unusable, and that's not that expensive to do (aiming is difficult but trajectories are predictable and positions are mostly public)
