[17:20:54] <ciphrCat> does that mean English does not have a word for very urgent?
[17:23:16] <xau> marshmallow, I suggest "to press".  It has the virtue of being the very verb you have already selected to clarify the nuance you seek.  For example: "Robin pressed Daisy to get the job done".  The one who presses may or may not be insistent.  "I will press him today.  And if the job doesn't get done, I will continue to press.  He'll see soon enough that I'm being insistent".

[22:49:55] <Hazey_Dream> Perhaps. Or it only improves within limits.
[22:50:06] <Hazey_Dream> Anyway, what kind of medical/scientific term could be made that could accurately describe that drug/substance, based on its effects?
[22:50:26] <Hazey_Dream> Like, I'm not sure it'd be called a "post-supressesion-steroid" or something.
[22:50:45] <Hazey_Dream> **supression
[22:52:15] <huf> you could drink all the digestion-related potions all the time
[22:52:29] <huf> and then you could eat lunch and shit a lead bullet
[22:52:31] <huf> at speed
[22:52:34] <Hazey_Dream> Lol.
[22:53:09] <huf> well, iron bullet
[22:53:14] <Hazey_Dream> IRL, some drugs have backlash/withdrawal effects after a period of the body not consuming them, right?
[22:53:22] <huf> that's if your digestion is now nuclear fusion
[22:54:35] <Hazey_Dream> If those can be considered as "Benefit, time, benefit turns into/is replaced by a detriment", what is the inverse, where it's something like "Detriment/Suppression, time, detriment/supression turns into/is replaced by a benefit"?
