It will login if validation passes and it will go to change password, if there is a password set in the redis database. Now my test is only testing successful login and failed login but not supposed to be testing the change password part, however, when testing

[04:32:28] <krismatrix> The reason it does is because the redis field that is being checked in the if{} is set to 1.
[04:32:34] <krismatrix> But that does not make sense.
[04:32:48] <krismatrix> For one, the value should be a md5 hash not 1 if populated at all.
[04:32:55] <ilmari> also, that stil ldoesn't look very minimal. nothing actually uses $t or $redis
[04:32:56] <krismatrix> But it should NOT be populated or exist for this test.

[05:17:01] <krismatrix> The way i went about it is commenting out the validateSignIn() and creating a new function and copying parts of it.
[05:17:17] <krismatrix> One of the validation checks was the thing that was causing the redis value to be set.
[05:17:27] <krismatrix> ->valid_pw().
[05:17:39] <krismatrix> After I got in there, I added a few warn statements to debug.
[05:17:58] <krismatrix> Basically, I was doing a check of password entered vs what is in redis database.
[05:18:41] <krismatrix> But in my test, the password is empty as ''. Since there was no redis entry either (as expected), the query also returned ''. But since i was doing a '' eq '', it returned true, which is NOT what I wanted.
[05:18:42] *** Joins: TonyStone (~TonyStone@cpe-74-76-51-197.nycap.res.rr.com)
[05:19:07] <krismatrix> So I added a defined on the redis db, and then did the eq. 
[05:19:11] <krismatrix> That resolved that problem.
[05:19:44] <ilmari> that makes it sound like you're storing the actual password in redisâ€¦ which you should NEVER do
[05:20:38] <krismatrix> It is supposed to be a temporary password when user does a forgot password request. I send them the password via email but don't overwrite the master sql database.
[05:20:45] <krismatrix> This temporary password is stored in redis instead.
[05:21:06] <krismatrix> Do you recommend against this?
[05:21:34] <krismatrix> It is a one time use only password that expires after 10 mins.
[05:21:47] <ilmari> don't send them a password, send them a password reset token, and store that
[05:21:58] <krismatrix> I have no idea what that is.
[05:22:07] <krismatrix> can you expand?
[05:25:42] <ilmari> generate a cryptographically secure random string, store that along with the username and a short expiry time (a few minutes), and email the user a link with that (e.g. https://example.com/reset_password?token=â€¦). if the user clicks that link before the expiry, let them set a new password
[05:27:03] <ilmari> that's pretty standard these days, if you've ever clicked "forgot password" on a website
[05:28:05] <krismatrix> hmm ok. I am going to store your suggestion. I will need to think through how to do that.
[05:29:36] <krismatrix> well...that blows. shoot.
[05:32:11] <krismatrix> Can I do this instead? Instead of a link, I can give them a temporary password. This password won't allow you to login in, but you can go to a change password page and use that temporary password and the username to change the password? The password would expire as your link suggestion. So it is not permanent.
[05:32:53] <krismatrix> anyway...your suggestion is probably standard practice...so I will try to figure out how to get that working.

[05:37:31] <ilmari> krismatrix: your "temporary password" is effectively a password reset token. but it's easier if you make it a link they can just click on, rather than having to copy-paste it into a form

[06:24:12] <tirnanog> buu: the lack of an /a modifier, perhaps (for ASCII semantics on \d). you might also want to mentally consider it as matching a decimal rather than a float. see the String::Numeric documentation for additional context.
[06:24:25] <tirnanog> also, \z instead of $, I guess.

[06:25:48] <Grinnz> yes
[06:25:49] <tirnanog> yes.
[06:25:50] <Grinnz> *
[06:26:05] <Grinnz> use [0-9] instead for what you usually think of as digits
[06:26:28] <buu> =[]
[06:26:57] <Grinnz> * it may or may not depending whether the string is upgraded, but there's no unicode digits that can be in a downgraded string so it's not an important distinction in this particular case
[06:27:25] <Grinnz> * it absolutely gets weird when you use \w though
[06:27:29] <buu> This makes me really sad
[06:27:41] <tirnanog> should it, though?
[06:28:03] <buu> YES
[06:28:04] <tirnanog> you have /a, [0-9] and \p{PosixDigit}. it's not as though you're short on options.
[06:28:08] <buu> Now my regexes are uglier
[06:28:35] <buu> oh
[06:28:36] <buu> I see
[06:29:15] <Grinnz> /a requires 5.14 and \p{PosixDigit} requires somewhere between 5.10 and 5.14
[06:29:21] <Grinnz> so i usually recommend the easy way
[06:29:34] <tirnanog> for CPAN authors, yeah. perfectly understandable.
[06:29:53] <buu> I also hate writing \z
[06:29:55] <tirnanog> some people find [0-9] easier to read, also, though that seems to go either way.
[06:29:55] <Grinnz> (also because i sometimes want ascii digits but unicode other things)
[06:30:06] <tirnanog> right. that's a compelling reason, for sure.
[06:30:10] <buu> I have to admit \A\d is worse than \A[0-9]
[06:30:21] <buu> But ^\d is better
[06:30:34] <tirnanog> well, at least you don't have to use \A. small mercies and all that.
[06:30:39] <buu> really?
[06:30:54] <tirnanog> I don't believe so. someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
[06:31:09] <Grinnz> \A is exactly equivalent to ^, except when /m is used
[06:31:11] <buu> if( not $value =~ /^\d+(\.\d+)?\z/a ) {
[06:31:13] <tirnanog> right. there we go.
[06:31:23] <Grinnz> \z is not equivalent to $ though
[06:31:27] <Grinnz> \Z is
[06:31:28] <tirnanog> so, yeah, that would do.
[06:31:32] <tirnanog> or !~
[06:31:33] <Grinnz> (except when /m is used)
[06:31:53] <buu> Hmm, I used !~ earlier, I should be consistent
[06:32:53] <tirnanog> not so bad, is it.
[06:33:45] <buu> Speaking of which, if I told you I had two validator functions, one named "integer" and one named "numeric", what would you expect some of the important differences to be?
[06:34:04] <Grinnz> how many insane assumptions each one makes
[06:34:37] <tirnanog> I would presume numeric to potentially be very loose, in the looks_like_number sense.
[06:34:52] <tirnanog> regardless, I would want to know the exact behaviour of the function before using it.
[06:35:16] <tirnanog> this is one thing I like about String::Numeric. the behaviour is very concretely documented.
[06:35:25] <buu> Yeah
[06:35:48] <Grinnz> i consider looks_like_number to be an api to a perl implementation detail
[06:35:53] <Grinnz> because it basically is
[06:36:11] <tirnanog> yeah. but, still, "number" can mean a great many things.
[06:36:21] <buu> Yeah I looked it up the other day to see if I wanted to use it and the documentation in scalar-util said "see perlapi" and perlapi is like "does what the c function does"
[06:36:27] <buu> so that was not great
[06:37:08] <buu> Is there a type system that uses 'decimal' as a type name?

[06:37:51] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Decimal Data Type - Visual Basic | Microsoft Docs ]
[06:37:55] <buu> Apparently yes
[06:38:34] <buu> Gah
[06:39:45] <buu> How about "PositiveDecimal" 
[06:40:02] <buu> Or I suppose Positive Float or something
[06:40:04] <buu> dunno
[06:40:07] <buu> Why am I doing this
[06:40:08] <tirnanog> UnsignedDecimal might be more accurate?
[06:40:36] <tirnanog> as you forbid for it to be signed, negative or not.
[06:41:16] <Grinnz> buu: decimal as a type usually means "XXX.YYY" format and also implies it is stored with exact precision rather than a binary float
[06:41:30] <Grinnz> which in perl means using Math::BigFloat or similar
[06:41:54] <buu> tirnanog: true
[06:42:20] <Grinnz> whereas a float could be 5e-17
[06:42:35] <Grinnz> and is stored inaccurately, usually
[06:42:39] <buu> But if you were using ctrl-f on a list of like 50 validators would you ever type unsigned decimal to find one
[06:42:49] <Grinnz> i have no idea, i dont use types

[17:16:53] <nceric> Hi, I use something like `perl -pi -e "s#search#replace#g" some_file` which does the search and replace in-place overwriting the file.Â  Is there a way to get the new contents to stdout instead of overwriting?
[17:17:52] <ilmari> nceric: drop the -i
[17:19:00] <kjetilho> not what you asked, but you can use -pi.bak to get a backup called some_file.bak
[17:21:03] <nceric> Thanks, the man page for perl didn't help much.Â  I know I always use `perl -pi -e` but when I went to look up what -i did there was nothing in the man page

[17:50:46] <ilmari> in Rust byte slices implement the Read trait, so you can just pass them to anything that wants to read from a file
[17:51:38] <Altreus> Also neat
[17:52:09] <Altreus> A minor refactor of sub main would let me do that in this case, honestly

[17:58:13] <micah> hi folks, i'm working in a unprivileged container, where the uid/gid are non-deterministic, and I'm trying to launch postfwd there, but it insists on doing a setuid()/setgid(), which is not allowed when not root, and I'm staring at https://github.com/postfwd/postfwd/blob/v1.39/sbin/postfwd2#L3272 trying to figure out if there is a way I can tell it to not do that and just use the euid/egid
[17:58:16] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ postfwd/postfwd2 at v1.39 Â· postfwd/postfwd Â· GitHub ]
[17:59:40] <Altreus> christ, a multi-thousand-line single script
[18:00:18] <micah> yeah, someone needs to be nailed to the cross here
[18:00:31] <Altreus> I'd love to help but my brain fuse blew
[18:02:53] <Altreus> using & to derefence coderefs :(
[18:04:50] <Altreus> micah: looks like --user and --group end up in that daemonize call https://github.com/postfwd/postfwd/blob/v1.39/sbin/postfwd2#L3084
[18:04:52] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ postfwd/postfwd2 at v1.39 Â· postfwd/postfwd Â· GitHub ]
[18:05:09] <Altreus> micah: so you can probably pass --user $USER --group ... something
[18:05:31] <Altreus> maybe it will be smart enough not to fail if it's already the right user and group
[18:05:53] <micah> Altreus: the problem is I cannot pass a user/group at all, I need it to call it so this happens: https://github.com/rhandom/perl-net-server/blob/master/lib/Net/Server.pm#L348

[18:07:40] <micah> it seems this calls Daemonize directly
[18:08:06] <Altreus> I'm gonna go with no - that line you started with is gonna pass something, and if you can't influence that then it's gonna pass 'nobody'

[18:08:39] <Altreus> how come you can't change the options at invocation?
[18:08:51] *** Quits: japh (~scp1@user/japh) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[18:08:57] <micah> in an unprivileged container, I cannot do setuid()
[18:09:10] <micah> so it doesn't matter what options are passed, I cannot do setuid()
[18:09:19] <revhippie> / $> # ?
[18:09:29] <revhippie> Rather, // $> # ?
[18:10:11] <micah> revhippie: sorry ?
[18:10:42] *** Joins: japh (~scp1@user/japh)
[18:10:47] <revhippie> micah: I'm probably misunderstanding -- that should default to the effective UID if ...{user} is undef.
[18:11:09] <revhippie> (Similarly, $) for EGID)
[18:11:23] <micah> revhippie: yes, but this script is calling Daemonize and not Net::Server
[18:11:38] <micah> so I guess I could make this script pass the EUID/EGID
[18:11:46] <Altreus> micah: because if you pass the options to your current uid/gid, then it won't have to setuid, because you're already that

[18:11:56] <Altreus> presumably setuid to oneself is a no-op
[18:11:59] <revhippie> Okay, I'm definitely not following "the problem" so ignore me.  :)
[18:12:03] <Altreus> if not ... well ... :/
[18:12:12] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:12:41] <Altreus> revhippie: ...{user} is never undef, and I can't see a way to force it to be
[18:13:05] <Altreus> revhippie: If it could be, then it would probably work as requested :(
[18:13:31] <Altreus> I hate this script :D
[18:14:54] <revhippie> I've seen worse.  It _does_ use `map` as a `for` loop a lot.
[18:15:15] <micah> couldn't I just pass the euid/egid to daemonize()?
[18:16:59] <micah> there we go: daemonize($>, $), $postfwd_settings{master}{pid_file}); probably would work
[18:17:38] <micah> what is this madness $> means $EUID and $) means $EGID in perl?
[18:18:28] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@dy6qm5z1fdmgwb8pyv5vy-4.rev.dnainternet.fi)
[18:18:28] <revhippie> micah: and $<, $( are real uid/gid
[18:18:39] <Altreus> sure you could, but then you'd have to edit the script instead of changing how you call it
[18:18:56] *** Quits: randir (~randir@93.159.239.42) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:19:25] <micah> revhippie: according to https://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar those are e uid/gid
[18:19:25] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ perlvar - Perl predefined variables - Perldoc Browser ]
[18:19:40] <Altreus> Kinda surprised we don't have builtin English names for them these days - $^FOO style
[18:19:43] <micah> Altreus: yeah, i'm unhappy about that too
[18:20:30] <Altreus> So maybe I'm just not paying attention but why can't you change how you invoke it instead of changing the script?
[18:20:48] <micah> how do I determine a non-deterministic thing?
[18:20:57] <micah> the uid/gid are non-deterministic
[18:21:01] <x5c30> just spitballing, but however you run it maybe postfwd .. -u $(id -u) -g $(id -g) ?
[18:21:30] <micah> x5c30: maybe that would work, i'll try that!
[18:21:31] <sokan> http://dpaste.com/HYTJZDQZM <-- After I enter all the numbers that I want to be added in @table I need to press one more enter, before the table numbers are printed. Why's that?
[18:21:31] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ dpaste: table.pl ]
[18:21:53] <Altreus> Yeah, there'll be a way to get the value at that point. Of course, then you have to ensure that the thing running it can cope with variables :D
[18:22:23] <Altreus> sokan: this is C code written in Perl
[18:22:30] <revhippie> sokan: your `for` loop runs $size+1 times.

[18:23:13] <Altreus> sokan: don't use -w
[18:23:31] <Altreus> you haven't declared @table, $i, or $size
