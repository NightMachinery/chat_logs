[03:10:09] <mekhami> i want to write a service that basically captures network traffic that would otherwise go to a third party service (in this case twilio) and instead responds with a pre-programmed response. basically a testing tool for our application that doesn't hit twilio, gives us better control over the response structure/values etc
[03:10:27] <mekhami> it would run inside a docker-compose setup and thus would be part of the docker network
[03:10:42] <mekhami> what infrastructural things do i need to know to capture network traffic like this
[03:11:06] <mekhami> how could i make it so that when elixir starts up, it captures that traffic, and when it shuts down it resumes 'normal' operations
[03:12:59] <mekhami> the trick is, i don't think i can just use something like bypass; it's a non-elixir application, running locally, that makes those requests to twilio.

[03:32:44] <mouseghost> something alike mitmproxy? it allows for stopping/replaying the requests etc
[03:32:57] <mekhami> mouseghost: yeah a proxy but one that intercepts calls to a third party endpoint
[03:33:12] <mekhami> i guess that's what mitmproxy is
[03:33:19] <mouseghost> yeah
[03:33:42] <mouseghost> theres nothing really overly complicated there
[03:34:44] <mouseghost> you could route all of that traffic through proxy and then just filter it one way or another 
[03:34:55] <mouseghost> or even possibly reroute it in the system?
[03:35:14] <mekhami> what would be interesting is... i want to conditionally intercept traffic; like "if i send to this phone number, then i want to respond with my preset, otherwise let it go to twilio"
[03:35:16] <mouseghost> im not sure if its possible hmmm, but like in linux theres routing table hmm
[03:35:48] <mouseghost> mekhami, doable, just program it; either in your own solution or through mitmproxy i guess
[03:36:10] <mouseghost> tho its not really something inherent to elixir hmmm
[03:36:32] <mekhami> basically the elixir part woiuld be a ph oenix liveview dashboard that lets the developer configure the response

[03:37:11] <mekhami> so the elixir part would basically just take all requests from mitmproxy, determine whether or not we should intercept, respond with 'yes here's the response' or 'no send it to twilio'
[03:37:53] <mouseghost> you dont even need the mitmproxy tbh
[03:38:26] <mekhami> i need to proof of concept this quickly so i can figure out if what i'm thinking is viable in a reasonable amount of time

[05:06:36] <Ankhers> What is the reason for not being able to do `def foo(%{key => value}, key), do: value'? Why am I unable to match the `key' value within the map?
[05:11:17] *** Quits: itinerati (uid504895@id-504895.charlton.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[05:12:57] <mekhami> are you asking like why that's a restriction or are you trying to get it to work?
[05:13:07] <mekhami> cause the compile error tells you explicitly you can't use a variable key as a map key inside a pattern
[05:15:13] <Ankhers> I'm asking why it is a restriction.
[05:17:12] <Ankhers> In my case, there is a matching variable in the function head. But I'm also unable to use the pin operator.
[05:17:27] <Ankhers> Is this just a case of no one has done the work or is there a real technical reason?
[05:17:33] <mekhami> why are you unable to use the pin operator
[05:18:03] <mekhami> well right now it's not possible in the elixir compiler
[05:18:07] <Ankhers> Because when used in the function head, I'm getting a `CompileError' saying that "key" has not been defined.
[05:18:14] <mekhami> s/elixir compiler/erlang compiler
[05:18:40] <mekhami> maps in general match on a subset of the provided argument
[05:19:00] <mekhami> so if you had a map with multiple keys/values, how can it know which to map on?
[05:20:20] <Ankhers> Because I have the key in another argument. It is no different than using the pin operator in this case. At least as far as I can see.
[05:20:57] <mekhami> the key in another argument doesn't guarantee that there's only one match, still
[05:21:37] <mekhami> and in any case, i'd imagine the cost of doign recursive pattern matching like that would be prohibitively costly
[05:22:46] <Ankhers> How can there be more than one match? We are allowed to do `%{^key => value}' inside a function body. Why can't I do something similar in the function head?
[05:24:46] <mekhami> the short answer is the erlang compiler doesn't support it.
[05:25:17] <mekhami> the long answer probably has something to do with scope, comparing scope resolution in multi-clause functions when function heads are self-referencing, etc
[05:26:41] <mekhami> pattern matching is not sequential; the pattern is analyzed at once, not left to right
[05:27:13] <mekhami> so it has no way of resolving what's pinned; it's not in the scope when it tries to resolve
[05:28:46] <mekhami> in order to support this, the compiler would have to do recursive pattern matching resolution, instead of the at-once resolution now. and i can imagine that could get hairy, and expensive
[05:29:31] <Ankhers> That is fair enough. Probably need to stop adding complexity somewhere.

[18:14:09] <dch> anybody using OTP24 / JIT in iex, and seeing that its *noticeably* faster?
[18:14:44] <benwilson512> dch: certainly compilation time is noticeably faster
[18:15:04] <dch> benwilson512: aye. im also seeing genservers start up much much faster
[18:15:33] <dch> in release/embedded mode
[18:15:47] <benwilson512> yeah I mean real world speed improvements seem to be 30-60% depending on workload so yea
[18:15:50] <benwilson512> huge win

[19:47:00] <benwilson512> joenoon: the adapter option isn't a global one, it's just applied to requests to that plug. I'm not sure off the top of my head whether the SDL printer supports an adapter
[19:47:54] <joenoon> benwilson512: right, i dont think it does.  currently brining the sdl mix task into my code to see if i can figure out how to modify it to pass the adapter in
[19:48:09] <Ankhers> If I get a large spike in traffic to my application and a bunch of ecto requests start failing, could that take down my application? 
[19:48:24] <benwilson512> joenoon: can you elaborate on the use case? SDL is an actual spec these days
[19:48:36] <benwilson512> the sdl printer generally favors both the spec and conventions around standard SDL printing
[19:51:55] <joenoon> benwilson512: just that im trying to get my schema.graphql to have the proper casing as if introspecting the schema at runtime... `type Mutation { verify_email(...): ... }` instead of `type Mutation { verifyEmail(...): ... }`
[19:52:27] <benwilson512> joenoon: no I get that, but I'm trying to understand what is going to read the SDL and prefer verify_email over verifyEmail
[19:53:49] <joenoon> ah, codegen in other apps.  i suppose i can look at having the other app get the schema from the url instead of from a static file
[19:54:29] <benwilson512> well, the code gen in the other app could also transform the parsed SDL as well

[19:57:07] <joenoon> benwilson512: interesting, yes i think the snake case is a bit weird.  we started stitching together a few different graphql endpoints with hasura (and using it for a few of its own things), and they use snake case all over, so im trying to wrap my head around it :) definitely feels not-normal, but their stuff is actually pretty near
