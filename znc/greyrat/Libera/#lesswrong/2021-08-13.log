[00:00:12] <ggreer> I don't think anyone really mentions it, but another thing that's improved over time has been how resistant homes are to infestations. older houses are constructed in such a way that rodents and other creatures can easily get into the walls. modern homes have insulation in walls, less empty space between foundation and structure, and are built with materials that can't be easily eaten by rodents/bugs/microbes
[00:00:43] <two2thehead> "It's clear that businesses recognize the problem. The electronics industry is pushing for visibility -- more information from more tiers of suppliers. Materials or substrate shortages, for example, can significantly impact component production schedules."
[00:00:53] <ggreer> not sure how to measure this though. it's not like there's a graph of infestations per capita
[00:01:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: How does termite resistance compare? That in particular is something I've wondered about
[00:01:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> You don't hear much about termite problems these days, do you?
[00:01:26] <ggreer> isn't most wood treated nowadays?
[00:01:26] <two2thehead> that's actually proven to lower prices. If the median knowledge of prices of raw materials are known by more people, ceteris paribus you have lower overall prices both in raw material and finished good

[00:03:54] <ggreer> now I'm in a place that was built in 2001 and it has reinforced concrete for some of the walls. the rest of the structure is pressure treated wood filled with fiberglass insulation. all that's covered in drywall
[00:05:13] <ggreer> oh and the foundation is cement with the first floor immediately on top of that giant cement block. compare to say... the house I lived in in berkeley. it had a dead space between the foundation and first floor, which was great for animals to hang out in (and then climb up into the walls)

[00:06:21] <ggreer> the walls in that place weren't treated. there was no insulation between the studs. covering was plaster instead of drywall

[01:41:45] <gwern> it's in a plateau of productivity. quest 2 continues to sell well, and an ecosystem slowly builds up. it's not the exponential growth doubling every year we hoped for, but I think VR is really here to stay
[01:42:08] <pompolic> i have a few ideas
[01:42:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Surely the case should be whatever the paper actually uses...?
[01:42:45] <pompolic> something i've been on the lookout for is that people started making EEG+NN BCI peripherals
[01:42:54] <pompolic> kind-of explicitly for VR
[01:43:03] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the problem is, in a lot of cases, the 'actually' is bullshit, because the pixels are set in all-caps so who knows what the author intended, and the 'metadata' on the publisher website is always untrustworthy and frequently gets the title itself subtly wrong
[01:43:10] <pompolic> this is not in the set of "few ideas" but i'll take it
[01:43:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Wouldn't the paper be submitted to somewhere, some conference, arxiv, something? What's there is canon, I should think...
[01:44:34] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: sometimes, but a lot of my papers it's just WSYWIYG. and when I check external metadata to see what case they use, it's clear that they don't have any better idea and some minimum-wage data-entry monkey or ancient OCR did it
[01:45:06] <gwern> so... this seems to be another case where I go 'fine, it'll just be house-style' and reformat annotations as I see fit
[01:45:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, ok, but wherever there's some source for the proper title of the paper, that *should* be the display title, and not modified ...
[01:45:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't agree with this approach you're talking about :\

[01:49:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not "better", it's *correct*
[01:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the paper's title

[11:16:11] <rmmh> hm this explanation isn't true for the tail
[11:16:22] <rmmh> or, not obviously so
[11:16:29] <rmmh> maybe the tail just receives less blood and operates at a lower temperature?
[11:18:46] <rsaarelm> Now you'd just need to edit the thermal gradient to match the siamese cat fur colors...

[12:12:19] <shawwwn> ok
[12:12:21] <shawwwn> this fucking bot
[12:12:24] <shawwwn> is really getting on my nerves
[12:12:54] <shawwwn> it was nice for awhile, since gwern seemed to limit his masturbatory activities to daytime
[12:12:59] <shawwwn> but now it's gwern 24/7
[12:13:09] <shawwwn> fuck that. feepbot ignored
[12:13:33] <otoburb> shawwwn: $160K base + 25% bonus (which seems pretty usual for an experienced SWE) takes you to $200K. 
[12:13:34] <shawwwn> hey, that was nice. irccloud even removed feepbot from the backlog
[12:14:01] <dbohdan> I like the gwernqueue
[12:14:16] <shawwwn> feep[work]: congratulations on creating something that was so annoying it made me, of all people, put it on /ignore. Never done that as long as I can remember
[12:14:27] <shawwwn> if you like gwernqueue, go to gwern.net
[12:14:46] <shawwwn> otoburb: what sort of bonus?
[12:14:50] <nshepperd2> https://irc.zlkj.in/uploads/066cc67ca0fb210c/20210813074031_0.png i asked for a "cthulhu is made of butterflies"... this is at best a dubious cthulhu-butterfly
[12:14:51] <dbohdan> shawwwn: No, it's different
[12:14:52] <Robomot> image/png (512x512; 346 KB)
[12:15:24] <shawwwn> dbohdan: since I like you, I'll hold back my usual insults
[12:15:26] <dbohdan> nshepperd2: With a little refinement it could go on a book cover
[12:15:38] <otoburb> shawwwn: many jobs extended to SWE can include a bonus component for the total compensation. worth asking if it's not included. 
[12:16:38] <otoburb> bonuses are usually structured as arbitrary goals that you don't find out about until after signing
[12:16:42] <shawwwn> I'm just not familiar with the various bonuses I could theoretically ask for
[12:16:55] <otoburb> depends on seniority usually
[12:17:05] <otoburb> did you get an offer letter, or is this only verbal/early stageS? 
[12:17:54] <shawwwn> verbal
[12:18:25] <shawwwn> it's also a contract gig, since they say I'm a risk. So it's not FTE
[12:18:40] <shawwwn> they said 3 mo contract.
[12:18:48] <otoburb> Oh that changes things. 
[12:19:05] <shawwwn> yep. things like my desire to work there
[12:19:08] <shawwwn> but hey, money.
[12:19:18] <shawwwn> the jew in me is crying out for it
[12:20:33] <feep[work]> hahaha
[12:20:37] <feep[work]> shawwwn: gwern overload
[12:20:42] <feep[work]> with the queue, gwern has become too powerful!
[12:21:03] <shawwwn> it should bother you that someone is /ignore'ing your otherwise useful bot
[12:21:07] <feep[work]> nah
[12:21:09] <shawwwn> I would say that *you* have become too powerful
[12:21:18] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: inside you there are two jews...
[12:21:19] <rsaarelm> The gwern-golem was meant to serve humanity, not rule over it!
[12:21:19] <shawwwn> it's time to make a feepbot replacement, I think
[12:21:19] <otoburb> $160K is about $150K base+bonus; assuming a 20% bonus that would be $125K base + $25K bonus (rough FTE equivalent)
[12:21:25] <feep[work]> what, another one
[12:21:34] <shawwwn> yes. yours isn't serving the public good
[12:21:54] <feep[work]> where "the public good" = "your preference for less gwern in #lesswrong"
[12:22:00] <rsaarelm> (I like the gwern-bot fwiw)
[12:22:01] <feep[work]> forgive me if I do not overflow with sympathy
[12:22:01] <otoburb> I guess if you really want the money now, go with the 3 month contract gig and in the meantime continue to cast the net
[12:22:33] <shawwwn> otoburb: yeah, I think I will. Thanks for gaming it out with me.
[12:22:45] <otoburb> The $125K base is actually not true because as a contractor you have to cover your own healthcare costs and other benefits
[12:23:17] <shawwwn> well, to be clear the offer is for $190k contract rate. after self employment tax, that drops it to $160k equivalent
[12:23:28] <otoburb> Oh you already took SECA into account ok :) 
[12:23:38] <shawwwn> yis
[12:24:04] <nshepperd2> healthcare and 'benefits' are $30k a year? gosh
[12:24:22] <shawwwn> healthcare, yes easily
[12:24:29] <otoburb> it can be sure
[12:24:55] <otoburb> shawwwn: yeah -- go with this and develop options in parallel. good position to be in!
[12:25:08] <shawwwn> yis, I think so
[12:25:15] <nshepperd2> brutal
[12:25:36] <shawwwn> surprising that they don't want me, but their loss.
[12:26:24] <shawwwn> feep[work]: you forced the feature on everybody with no way to opt-out. For example, you could've easily spun up another instance of feepbot specifically for gwernqueue
[12:26:30] <otoburb> They're lowballing you
[12:26:36] <shawwwn> that way we could /ignore that, while retaining feepbot's usefulness
[12:27:07] <shawwwn> but now that I no longer have feepbot's utility, I'll need to make another one.
[12:28:15] <feep[work]> shawwwn: are you trying to convince me or you
[12:28:22] <feep[work]> go for it. more people should make irc bots.
[12:28:53] <feep[work]> shawwwn: that said, can your client not do regex ignores?
[12:28:58] <feep[work]> maybe add that instead :p
[12:29:16] <shawwwn> I'm calling you a complete and total asshole douchenozzle for not simply spinning up a second instance of feepbot, in addition to being a gwern lapdog brownnoser
[12:29:29] <feep[work]> I am 100% a gwern lapdog brownnoser.
[12:29:35] <shawwwn> then enjoy the smell
[12:30:02] <feep[work]> meh
[12:30:14] <feep[work]> shawwwn: srsly, what irc client are you using?
[12:30:17] <feep[work]> irssi has regex ignores..
[12:30:21] <shawwwn> irccloud.
[12:30:37] <feep[work]> oyeah okay that would be kinda hard to patch
[12:30:43] <shawwwn> yes.
[12:30:49] <feep[work]> fundamentally "making another feepbot" is nontrivial
[12:30:59] <cpopell> I'm also using irccloud, but also don't care. there's way less botspam than there's been in previous times I was in here tbh
[12:30:59] <feep[work]> due to the fact that it's a patched together mess, they'd be competing for every command
[12:31:04] <cpopell> it's just kinda part of the background
[12:31:25] <feep[work]> shawwwn: hey, why don't you just make a dedicated gwernqueue bot
[12:31:38] <feep[work]> it'd be fun, and you could ignore it
[12:31:59] <shawwwn> we have different ideas of fun.
[12:32:12] <feep[work]> irssi is a very nice friendly protocol
[12:32:14] <feep[work]> irc*
[12:32:32] <feep[work]> p much every language has "for each line", and that is all you really need
[12:32:34] <kuudes> healthcare is 30k/y
[12:32:36] <kuudes> wow
[12:32:37] <shawwwn> the competition is easily resolved by hooking the print() functionality and only allowing through <gwern>
[12:32:39] <nshepperd> *squint*
[12:32:49] <feep[work]> shawwwn: no it's not, that's stupid, you're stupid
[12:32:53] <feep[work]> stop being stupid
[12:32:57] <kuudes> a private doctor's visit costs out of pocket less than 100 e
[12:32:59] <shawwwn> you hate it because you know it'll work
[12:33:01] <kuudes> here
[12:33:14] <feep[work]> no I hate it because you're talking bullshit you don't know shit about and you should stop
[12:33:18] <feep[work]> like, *that* makes me angry
[12:33:23] <kuudes> even with overestimating public subsidies, the total gross is less than 200 e per visit for anyone
[12:33:28] <shawwwn> good, I was looking for a way
[12:33:42] <feep[work]> okay, thanks, that's enough justification
[12:33:45] * feep[work] /ignore shawwwn 
[12:33:50] <shawwwn> ta.
[12:34:21] <otoburb> kuudes: not quite; self-employment taxes + healthcare/other benefits could cost up to $30K
[12:34:37] <kuudes> oh, it includes taxes as well?
[12:34:41] <nshepperd> what's a self employment tax
[12:34:43] <otoburb> Some of them
[12:35:03] <nshepperd> why isn't that just income tax
[12:35:24] <otoburb> nshepperd: in America, employers usually have to pony up 7.65% social security + medicare, as does the employee
[12:35:53] <otoburb> if you're self-employed (i.e. contractor), you are on the hook for both parts for a total of around 15.3%
[12:36:12] <otoburb> but there's some stupid complicated threshold so it's not quite 15%, but usually less if you earn more than $143K (social security threshold)
[12:36:24] <nshepperd> wow
[12:36:36] <otoburb> Your income tax is completely separate -- you're taxed on that by the IRS later. 
[12:36:39] <nshepperd> so actually American taxes are super high?
[12:36:44] <nshepperd> basically
[12:37:00] <otoburb> I guess it depends on where you live in the US, and your baseline comparison
[12:37:16] <otoburb> If you compare US taxes to, say, Canada ... US generally tends to be lower taxes
[12:37:33] <otoburb> (unless you live in California or New York, in which case it can often be similar)
[12:37:52] <otoburb> but compared to Hong Kong -- yeah the US is expensive

[13:46:17] <kuudes> eh, yes, methane use might indeed not be good
[13:46:20] <nshepperd2> hydrogen fuel cells were only ever going to be complicated electric batteries
[13:46:44] <kuudes> electrolysis is good but requires the power to come from somewhere
[13:47:05] <kuudes> ues
[13:47:07] <kuudes> yes
[13:47:14] <feep[work]> cynically, hydrogen was just intended as natural gas greenwashing
[13:47:28] <kuudes> ~
[13:47:39] <kuudes> though over here at least the new plans seem to me goodish
[13:48:00] <kuudes> ie ssab carbonless steel thing, where they electrolyse their own hydrogen when electricity is cheap
[13:48:20] <kuudes> and if electricity gets expensive, they can stop 'lysing or just burn it back to water and electricity
[13:48:44] <kuudes> and pipelines could offer less transit loss than wires
[13:49:05] <kuudes> basicly with windpower it would seem like quite on the spot solution
[13:49:14] <dutchie> aiui also from an air quality point of view hydrogen is cleaner than natural gas in home boilers and cookers
[13:49:21] <kuudes> yeah
[13:49:29] <kuudes> though we don't have home gas use much anymore
[13:49:29] <nshepperd2> sure, it'll kill you less
[13:49:41] <rmmh> yes there's no carbon
[13:49:58] <kuudes> helsinki might still have some areas where there is home gas available, but otherwise it is about nonexistent here
[13:50:07] <dutchie> AQ is currently a big part of my day job so to some extent i see a lot of climate/energy discourse through that lens
[13:50:12] <rmmh> sad. cooking with gas is nice
[13:50:22] <dutchie> most if not all uk houses still have gas heating/boilers
[13:50:25] <kuudes> gas explosions by neighbours aren't though, rmmh
[13:50:26] <dutchie> gas cookers are dying out
[13:50:39] <rmmh> vanishingly rare
[13:50:40] <dutchie> there was a big gas explosion near me a couple of months ago
[13:50:54] <dutchie> https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-57232373

[13:51:51] <kuudes> but yeah, thanks to tesla, I think cars likely should be electric
[13:52:22] <nshepperd2> damn, the baby died? he must have been at ground zero
[13:52:26] <kuudes> we have some amount of methane cars here with the biogas produced by waste management, and that would maybe be good, but it is sort of fringe still
[13:53:25] <Gurkenglas> grmblgrmblgrmbl ai21 wants phone verification and if i procrastinate long enough theyll probably stop being free
[13:53:30] <kuudes> I wonder if powerwall would be a good investment

[22:22:12] <pompolic> oh well, i asked because i also like the D&D aspect
[22:22:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Today's two examples of "cognitive requirements for navigating consumerism":
[22:24:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> You buy a brand of, say, sour cream, because it has some desirable nutritional properties (fat content, lack of certain additives, whatever). One day the manufacturer totally changes the formulation of the product, such that it no longer resembles the previous one. The packaging remains 100% identical (except for the ingredients list in tiny print). How do you tell? Do you carefully inspect the ingredients list of everything
[22:24:04] <Obormot\Arcturus>  you buy every single time, even if you're purchasing exactly the same things?
[22:24:50] <pompolic> something I've seen here is putting a "nutri-score" scale from A to E
[22:24:57] <pompolic> which just makes me die inside
[22:25:26] <pompolic> "i know, we'll throw out some dimensions of the problem" argh no stop
[22:25:28] <RiversHaveWings> bc nutrition science is totally trustworthy
[22:25:35] <pompolic> i know right
[22:25:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Second example. There's a shelf full of, say, pomegranate juice, from a half-dozen different brands. Each shares these properties: tall glass bottle full of identically-colored liquid; similarly-designed labels, prominently stating that the juice comes from, say, Georgia; that it's not from concentrate; that it's healthy; pictures of pomegranates; etc.
[22:26:14] <pompolic> i just engage Protein Sight when i go to the store
[22:26:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Five of the brands' bottles contain pure juice. The sixth contains a mix of juice, water, citric acid, and corn syrup.
[22:26:27] <pompolic> (this is a shitpost)
[22:27:00] <pompolic> another thing i noticed, elsewhere
[22:27:09] <pompolic> i have this long-standing vendetta against margarine
[22:27:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, this is, of course, exactly what we'd expect, given that there's obvious incentives to exert optimization pressure on deceptiveness
[22:27:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the result is underappreciated, I feel
[22:27:45] <pompolic> eating butter was like "wtf 'butter' can be good?"
[22:28:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hah yeah
[22:28:23] <pompolic> anyway, as far as i can tell, at the place i'm talking about, there's regulation in place to not make these identical
[22:28:35] <pompolic> they're still packaged nearly identically, modulo branding
[22:28:43] <rmmh> missed 3 due to rushing q.q
[22:29:09] <pompolic> except on the budget versions, it says "spreadable plant fat" (translation)
[22:29:28] <pompolic> and i know of at least one person who does not understand the difference
[22:30:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> The difference between ... butter and margarine??
[22:30:06] <pompolic> yes
[22:30:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf
[22:30:22] <pompolic> and you don't really see the whole "can't believe it's not butter" thing that you see in america
[22:30:34] <pompolic> although the more fancy brands do put butter imagery on it
[22:30:54] <pompolic> as far as i can tell, they have to say it's margarine one way or another
[22:31:21] <pompolic> i think i want to observe that marketing is just an adversarial attack on people's heuristics, so i kind of can't fault people for it
[22:31:37] <rmmh> pompolic: google's cafeterias had a color coding system from green to red for food. the trick was that the red food actually tasted good

[22:42:01] <Robomot> Nvidia Reveals Its CEO Was Computer Generated in Keynote Speech (Nvidia pulled off a stunt to promote and showcase its latest technology by digitizing its CEO Jensen Huang in a conference keynote.)
[22:42:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Unseeing marketing doesn't help with my example #1, and *barely* (if at all) with #2
[22:42:32] <pompolic> category boundaries probably matter to a nonzero amount
[22:42:48] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: It is necessary but not sufficient
[22:42:48] <pompolic> unseeing is a way to get out of other people pushing their category boundaries, imo
[22:43:02] <quanticle> Oh, the *video* of the CEO was computer generated. For a second I thought they were saying that like... Jensen Huang himself was an AI
[22:43:05] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[22:43:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Yes
[22:44:03] <quanticle> And I don't know what it says about me, but I was like, "Yeah, it's plausible that nVidia would be the first company with an artificial CEO. Huang probably uploaded himself to a GPU cluster sometime back in '19"
[22:44:03] <pompolic> actually, i said i'd recuse myself, but
[22:44:13] <rmmh> err, did they just... make a digital set behind him? and he was virtual in the holodeck? https://youtu.be/1qhqZ9ECm70?t=1416

[22:44:18] <pompolic> i know of people who started their career by breaking copy protection
[22:44:56] <pompolic> in fact this seems so common as to be unremarkable
[22:45:44] <rmmh> pompolic: my first moment of computer enlightenment was using a hex editor to edit savegames and realizing "it's all just numbers..."
[22:46:15] <pompolic> wait until you hear about weird machines
[22:46:26] <dbohdan> quanticle: I am not sure about the distinction.  There are definitely hackers who both make and break things and those only break things.
[22:46:30] <pompolic> code is data is code (if your grammar is complex enough)
[22:46:43] <quanticle> rmmh: This story gets more and more disappointing. We've gone from AI CEO, to computer-rendered CEO to... "fancy Zoom background"
[22:46:48] <feep> kate is dota
[22:46:58] <quanticle> dbohdan: Yeah, but in terms of mindset? It's the same mindset
[22:47:39] <pompolic> actually, to argue against myself
[22:47:52] <pompolic> building and breaking are in fact slightly different
[22:48:09] <pompolic> but i think you can learn one from the other
[22:48:14] <quanticle> >if your grammar is complex enough
[22:48:17] <quanticle> Doesn't Lisp have a pretty simple grammar? Or are you referring to e.g. the distinction between context-free grammars and Turing-complete grammars?
[22:48:18] <dbohdan> quanticle: Right.  But they are different cultures.  I suspect you can tell whether someone is a break-things-only hacker better than chance just by talking to them.
[22:48:39] <pompolic> quanticle: the latter is exactly what I'm referring to
[22:48:42] <dbohdan> (Without directly asking about their work)
[22:50:03] <quanticle> I know several people who are "break-things only" hackers (they work for security firms and do penetration tests, etc.). I don't think you could tell the difference just by talking to them. They're all fairly decent programmers in their own right, and are more than happy to discuss (constructive) programming projects, even though their primary job is breaking into things.
[22:50:07] <pompolic> further observations: people made respect noises at me for being able to figure out what format/filetype a random hexdump is
[22:50:32] <quanticle> Without looking anything up?
[22:50:46] <pompolic> well, kind of
[22:50:47] <quanticle> That's mildly impressive. I don't have a database of file headers in my brain.
[22:51:21] <pompolic> the example i'm thinking of involved noticing that the distribution of byte values seems to resemble x86 instructions
[22:52:06] <pompolic> but i did actually have to throw it in a disassembler to check my intuition
[22:52:13] <rmmh> just squint at the first 5 bytes
[22:52:31] <pompolic> i have a cheat code though
[22:52:33] <dbohdan> quanticle: Perhaps I'm wrong.  Thinking about how I model them, I think I expect break-things-only hackers to be more aggressive and dark-triady.
[22:52:37] <pompolic> grapheme->color synesthesia
[22:52:49] <quanticle> dbohdan: Oh, *definitely not*
[22:53:12] <quanticle> None of the ones I know are assholes
[22:53:31] <quanticle> They have a certain impatience with pointless bureaucracy, but again, that's common to *all* hackers
[22:53:39] <pompolic> it actually helps giving a really shitty estimate of the entropy of the data, from which you can make further guesses
[22:53:55] <pompolic> mostly just that high entropy is probably compressed or encrypted
[22:53:55] <dbohdan> quanticle: Yeah, that's just "hacker"
[22:54:11] <pompolic> https://codisec.com/veles/ there are some pretty great tools for this sort of stuff
[22:54:13] <Robomot> Veles - Binary Analysis Tool - CodiSec				CodiSec (Veles is a new open source tool for binary file analysis which combines hex editor and binary data visualization features. Veles is based on a flexible distributed architecture to allow the addition of new functionalities through plugins.)
[22:54:32] <pompolic> i was walking around the office showing everyone the spinny cube
[22:56:28] <pompolic> quanticle: i can see why it would seem impressive, but it's more like, i happen to have hardware support for something really niche
[22:57:58] <gwern> pompolic: is 'goodspeed' really his name?
[22:58:11] <pompolic> as far as i can tell
[22:58:19] <gwern> seems a bit on the nose
[22:58:45] <dbohdan> pompolic: Wow, things have improved since HIEW :-)
[22:58:51] <gwern> does 'travis goodspeed' do a lot of testing of his optimizations?
[22:59:03] <pompolic> i'd have to ask him when i see him again
[23:00:20] <quanticle> pompolic: Yeah, like the way I can read fast, but I'm not actually all that smart at anything else. My mom said to me once, "When you learned to read so young, I thought you were really smart. Now I know, you're just good at reading."
[23:00:32] <quanticle> Hardware accelerated OCR
[23:00:37] <two2thehead> ouch
[23:01:14] <quanticle> It's true, though
[23:01:19] <pompolic> it could be that it's all g-loaded
[23:01:23] <pompolic> i don't know
[23:01:51] <quanticle> I mean, sure, but even gwern will admit that verbal and mathematical reasoning are separate subcategories of G
[23:02:20] <two2thehead> iirc that is the case
[23:02:33] <pompolic> oh, well then
[23:02:41] <pompolic> my exploit is to use visual reasoning to do both
[23:03:35] <pompolic> verbal reasoning feels like symbolic manipulation, which feels like showing .jpgs of words around
[23:03:50] <quanticle> Sure, that's how I do it as well.
[23:04:07] <pompolic> mathematical reasoning feels reaching to describe a picture, and grabbing an equation instead of words
[23:04:13] <dbohdan> quanticle: I've read the moon story in _Mission Critical_, by the way.  It was by Greg Egan and okay.  Definitely not as good as "Cyclopterus".  It felt carefully constructed, physically plausible (not that I really know), and detailed, but still kind of phony?  The friend removing herself from the picture was an overly convenient plot device.
[23:04:26] <pompolic> feels like*
[23:05:01] <pompolic> there are funny failure modes like typo-ing on the concept level
[23:05:05] <pompolic> i think that's just malapropisms
[23:09:47] <quanticle> To be honest, none of the other stories in _Mission Critical_ were as good as "Cyclopterus". After seeing Obormot\Arcturus talk about some of the other stories, I went back and re-read the whole anthology, and I stand by my original assessment. The one by Aliette De Bodard was somewhat interesting, but I feel like the ending was too pat. I thought the Linda Nagata one was fun, actually, contrary
[23:09:50] <quanticle> to Obormot's assessment. The others were all kind of meh. "Icebreaker", by Kristine Kathyrin Rusch was barely even a science fiction story.
[23:11:42] <quanticle> It was more like a noir mystery that happened to take place in the future. You could have rewritten it without any of the spaceships and stuff and the plot would have worked just fine.

[23:25:18] <two2thehead> absolutely, but video is more convincing to most people than engineering/mechanic's reports
[23:25:18] <pompolic> if i recall correctly, lightning striking glass makes some distinctive cracks

[23:40:46] <quanticle> I agree, but it's probably more like the Lockheed Martin contractor saying, "Yeah, sorry, this one's grounded for the next week, unless you pay extra to have the spare parts rush ordered from our factory in California." It's not as if the Kuwaitis or Saudis are stupid enough to trust the maintenance of their fancy American-made fighter jets, which they paid literally *billions* for, to local
