[01:51:29] <dTal> indeed they are
[01:54:27] *** kurahaupo_ is now known as kurahaupo
[01:55:17] <kurahaupo> StayHungry: are you looking for confirmation or for more terms?
[01:55:48] <StayHungry> oh, sorry. i wonder what's the best adjective here and if there are subtle differences
[01:57:10] <dTal> depends what you're trying to say, and what kind of star
[01:57:42] <dTal> distant fusion reaction in the sky, or famoous person?
[01:57:46] <StayHungry> 1
[01:59:50] <dTal> unreachable carries a bit more connotation of distance while maintaining visibility, while inaccessible (to me) could have a hint of physical obstruction about it. Unattainable is an adjective I'd reserve for goals, rather than locations.
[02:00:24] <dTal> But unreachable and inaccessible are fairly interchangable.
[02:00:56] <kurahaupo> don't get stuck on the idea that the best description has to be a single word. "out of reach" or "too far away"' might be best in some circumstances
[02:01:07] <dTal> hard ta get to
[02:01:29] <dTal> 2many lightyears 4me
[02:01:56] <StayHungry> dTal: your explanations suits me perfectly

[02:02:27] <StayHungry> *suit
[02:02:34] <kurahaupo> They're not technically difficult to get to, it just takes a very long time. 
[02:04:34] <dTal> StayHungry: The thing is, although my intuitive connotation dump might suggest that "unreachable" is the more appropriate  term, sometimes you might want to use a slightly less appropriate term in order to suggest a poetic imagery. For example, if you wanted to cast attention on the vastness of space as a barrier, you might be more inclined to put "inaccessible".
[02:04:58] <dTal> s/appropriate/literal
[02:04:59] <tinsoldier> d​Tal meant: StayHungry: The thing is, although my intuitive connotation dump might suggest that "unreachable" is the more literal  term, sometimes you might want to use a slightly less appropriate term in order to suggest a poetic imagery.

[02:05:08] <kurahaupo> Over the next thousand years Voyager 1 will likely visit several star systems
[02:05:16] <dTal> wrong appropriate
[02:05:16] <StayHungry> dTal: yeah, i begin to understand that
[02:07:11] <kurahaupo> So the best phrase will be determined by the reason for making the statement; what nuance are you trying to convey?
[02:07:50] <kurahaupo> "Humans don't live long enough"?
[02:10:12] <dTal> I like "ineffable"
[02:10:32] <dTal> can't be reached in a metaphorical, conceptual sense

[02:34:02] <StayHungry> dTal: a new meaning of 'ineffable' on my radar then. i would say 'ineffable bliss', but star... :)
[02:34:23] <dTal> ? it's just the same old meaning
[02:34:32] <dTal> ineffable = unknowable
[02:35:26] <dTal> I guess to "eff" means to "know"
[02:35:38] <dTal> hence why people say "eff that"

[02:38:21] <LuisP14> !d effable
[02:38:23] <tinsoldier> effable — Adjective: 1. (archaic) Able to be spoken of; able to be expressed. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/effable
[02:38:34] <bin> ineffable is such a good word but it doesn't really mean unknowable, it means more like to large to express which is slightly different
[02:39:13] <dTal> well how is anyone supposed to know about something you can't express?
[02:39:39] * dTal hands bin a spare 'o'
[02:40:23] <bin> because you can know something and still be unable to put it into words
[02:40:30] <bin> like "an ineffable quality"
[02:41:19] <LjL> wiktionary gives "Beyond expression in words; unspeakable." for ineffable which seems closer to what bin said
[02:41:36] <LjL> philosophically, i don't know, but word meanings don't have to be logico-philosophically sound

[02:45:20] <LjL> although
[02:45:23] <CalimeroTeknik> kurahaupo, that which all of this is, but I suppose it is too generic for an English word to exist!

[02:45:36] <LjL> maybe i'm just thinking of Stendhal syndrome
[02:46:39] <CalimeroTeknik> one interesting point here is that loan words are the occasion to imbue them with a new meaning/nuance (as seen in Japanese)
[02:47:49] <bin> https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/ineffable
[02:47:53] <bin> this is the definition i'm used to

[02:49:14] <LuisP14> !d affable
[02:49:16] <tinsoldier> affable — Adjective: 1. Receiving others kindly and conversing with them in a free and friendly manner; friendly, courteous, sociable., 2. Mild; benign. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/affable
[02:49:27] <CalimeroTeknik> see also: agreeable
[02:49:50] <kurahaupo> CalimeroTeknik: as I said, don't get fixated on "a single word". Every language has things it can express briefly, and things that require longer phrases. If something becomes commonplace enough then a word will be coined for it, if not just know that native speakers don't think anything is "strange" or "missing" when we have to use a longer phrase 
[02:50:06] <CalimeroTeknik> yes
[02:51:43] <CalimeroTeknik> in software architecture sometimes I stumble on those, where it's baffling no word has been coined, and sometimes I do find something or coin one, which makes sense but isn't in the dictionary

[03:08:18] <furrykef> But here's the problem as I see it
[03:08:48] <StayHungry> sorry, i'm not that good with right-left  :) for example, I have an opinion about all so-called controversial issues, but according to their classification I do not fall into any of 2 parties. so this dividing dichotomy seems artificial by-product of their power play. if there are only 2 parties to choose from and both parties adhere to contradicting points, where the third reconciling voice would come from.
[03:09:28] <furrykef> Let's say a president (I'm not gonna say which one I have in mind) does 9 bad things and 1 good thing. A paper covers all 10 things.

[03:16:34] <furrykef> dTal: There are people who feel that way about Biden
[03:16:54] <furrykef> I don't understand them, but they exist
[03:17:31] <StayHungry> because so far it seems (from the distance) that people are just picking sides and there is no dialog
[03:18:04] <dTal> have you ever attempted to have a dialog with a fascist
[03:18:36] <furrykef> I used to try to at least listen to the other side, but over the past few years they have been saying fewer and fewer things I find worth listening to
[03:18:37] <dTal> it is not rewarding
[03:18:48] <StayHungry> half of the country are fascists? :)
[03:19:03] <dTal> In America? It's more like 30%

[03:19:22] <dTal> Believe it
[03:19:30] <dTal> ya got a serious problem
[03:19:38] <furrykef> I'd say it's more that a small percentage of Americans are actively fascist, but a surprisingly large percentage of Americans are OK with fascism
[03:19:57] <LuisP14> can't argue against somebody that suddenly throws a fit when their view is countered, i guess

[17:47:30] <no_gravity> StayHungry: It is just 4 words :) I would say they are all important.
[17:47:30] <Inhahe> or Tech Product Specification Research?
[17:47:51] <no_gravity> "Tech Data Research" might also work, but I thik it makes it less clear what it is about.
[17:47:54] <Inhahe> idk, i'm not extremely familiar with kob titles

[17:57:03] <StayHungry> no_gravity: if a detailed explanation follows (like 'our product X generates data, which you shall process according to specified metrics and goals to get a bigger, human-readable picture'), then you can shorten title to 'data research'
[17:58:10] <no_gravity> StayHungry: Yes, a whole page of explanation is below the title. The 4 words are just the title by which people see it on job portals.

[18:03:37] <GuiToris> hello, I'm making an audio book and I'd like to give credit to the author. He wrote that and read it aloud. How can I do that? Written and ??? by (NAME)
[18:06:05] <lall-> narrated by?
[18:06:13] <lall-> or read by
[18:06:29] <lall-> read by most likely more accurate.
[18:06:45] *** Parts: no_gravity (~no_gravit@user/no-gravity/x-5639427) ()
[18:08:15] <GuiToris> thank you!
[18:08:32] <StayHungry> GuiToris: 'narrated by the author'
[18:10:35] <GuiToris> I'm not sure if narrate means to read the text as it is
[18:10:48] <GuiToris> sense 1) to explain what is happening in a film or television programme as part of the film or programme
[18:11:30] <lall-> that's why i think "read by" is more accurate. narration is more ofa commentary

[18:16:55] <wyre> is "opened" usually used? 
[18:18:08] <lall-> I just opened a bottle of beer.
[18:18:43] <wyre> lall-, sure but in this case open is also an adjetive, right? 
[18:18:48] <StayHungry> GuiToris: 'read by' is more like 'he familiarized himself with the text' whereas 'narrated by' or 'performed by' implies outward endeavor.
[18:19:35] <lall-> StayHungry, i don't think that's true. Read by in context of audiobooks doesnot mean "he familiarized himself with the text".
[18:19:43] <lall-> context matters.
[18:21:41] <StayHungry> lall-: whereas narrated by or performed by does not require one
[18:22:16] <StayHungry> when you come to a library, there are cards attached to every book which say 'read by: (names)' :D
[18:22:17] <lall-> yes, but narrated generally means commentary. Like "narrated by David Attenborough". 
[18:23:04] <lall-> Dictionary: "a commentary delivered to accompany a movie, broadcast, etc."
[18:23:36] <StayHungry> lall-: it's a secondary, context-dependent meaning you quote.

[18:23:54] <StayHungry> because narration is 'the action or process of narrating a story'
[18:24:28] <lall-> "narration is narrating". The question is what does "narrating" mean, that explanation is not very good as it said narration is "naratting a story"
[18:24:37] <lall-> read by is clearer
[18:24:59] <lall-> my gf reads story book to my children all the time, she's not narrating anything. she's reading it.
[18:25:03] * LuisP14 just thinks of recounting as per view
[18:25:46] <lall-> _narration_ is 'the action or process of _narrating_ a story'. great explanation /sarcasm :)

[18:26:10] *** LSD is now known as acidsys
[18:26:29] <LuisP14> recounting the story as per one's view :>
[18:31:11] <lall-> well ok, i think it's a bit ambigous.
[18:31:19] <lall-> that's why i prefer "read by".
