[00:20:41] <Satin> and I haven't been using gnome-builder at all, just doing it by hand. I had a very bad week yesterday where I spent days procrastinating after not understanding how uh
[00:20:57] <Satin> stack/menu items and stuff worked
[00:21:06] <Satin> it all makes sense now and i can tab back and forth? lOl
[00:22:05] <Satin> the amount of work I had to do to get to that point and skimmimng through all the sparse examples and GTK4 APIs and new way of doing things 
[00:22:07] <Satin> pfft
[00:22:27] <Satin> but now i'm trying to study 3-4 different textbooks in a month before next semester
[00:22:36] <Satin> but i'm obsessed with setting up a nice workflow first
[00:23:01] <Satin> so i spent an entire day yestreday trying to configure nnn filemanager cli, getting repeatedly frustrated with its inability to work with ffmpeg on an ubuntu based PopOS system
[00:23:25] <Satin> but in the process downloaded so many different terminals, messed with tmux, and now i've ended up with kitty, which also has a different pane
[00:23:35] <Satin> and then in the end settled on fucking ranger

[00:25:44] <Satin> why are you drinking so much caffine jess
[00:25:45] <Satin> bruh
[00:26:17] <JesseDesu> i had 3 cups of coffee at 4am
[00:26:32] <JesseDesu> then 2 cups of energy green tea
[00:26:39] <Satin> chill
[00:26:51] <JesseDesu> then a bang energy drink at 10:30
[00:26:55] <Satin> chill
[00:27:02] <Terminus> Satin: i'm pretty happy with my current workflow. just podman everything. no compilers and libs on the host OS.
[00:27:02] <Satin> holy shit chill
[00:27:19] * Satin googles podman
[00:28:51] <HeTo> Satin: you really should be learning shell though
[00:28:53] <Satin> JesseDesu: why so much caffine dawg
[00:29:07] <Satin> HeTo: yes,,, though i'd rather do it while doing other things 
[00:29:10] <Satin> you're rithgt though
[00:29:16] <Satin> Terminus: interesting... podman very interesting.
[00:29:17] <Terminus> Satin: containers. if you know how to use docker, you know how to use podman except podman i think is nicer because it doesn't require root. you can run it as a regular user. available in bullseye.
[00:29:23] <HeTo> pipes and the basic text processing tools like cut, tr, sed, awk, grep
[00:29:24] <KatrinValerie> HeTo: shell is black magic and anything that's held together by shell scripts spells doom
[00:29:46] <Satin> I don't know what docker works like yet, but i see
[00:29:48] <Terminus> i have my entire c++ build running inside a container. even gdb.
[00:29:56] <Satin> damm
[00:29:58] <KatrinValerie> Satin: it works like crap
[00:30:03] <Satin> isolated little virtual machines?
[00:30:05] <HeTo> KatrinValerie: you don't have to write shell scripts to use the shell
[00:30:11] <Satin> KatrinValerie: hot takes left and right today
[00:30:14] <Satin> calm
[00:30:19] <Satin> :p
[00:30:26] <Satin> Terminus:  fascinating
[00:30:31] <KatrinValerie> HeTo: ipython is way supirior
[00:30:36] <JesseDesu> i feel better after throwing up a little
[00:30:43] <Terminus> Satin: yes minus the overhead of actual virtual machines. they're very lightweight.
[00:30:54] <HeTo> KatrinValerie: and she's learning TUI file managers to do mostly the same thing mostly worse, when she could be learning shell to learn new things to offload stuff to the computer instead of doing it manually
[00:31:14] <Satin> i like th eexperience
[00:31:16] <Terminus> so no windows containers but you can run any linux distro in a container. i tend to use alpine when i can because they're very lightweight.
[00:31:17] <JesseDesu> satin i like the taste of caffeinated drinks
[00:31:23] <Satin> JesseDesu: drink water 
[00:31:28] <Satin> sparkling water
[00:31:49] <JesseDesu> i hear that a lot
[00:31:51] <Satin> i had a weird situation earlier today, it was like 7 am or wahtever and i was extremely tired
[00:31:53] <Terminus> except for compiling native bins. alpine is annoying with those because it uses musl instead of glibc. compile hello world on alpine and it won't run on debian, RHEL, etc.
[00:31:56] <Satin> i got a sparkling water can

[02:18:22] <Bco1981> atleast there is some meat in there...
[02:18:53] <MootPoot> Not very cost effective
[02:19:02] <MootPoot> Eating salad nonstop won't get you anywhere
[02:19:06] <MootPoot> You need filling food 
[02:19:21] <Satin> ur right but i actually enjoy salad
[02:19:23] <MootPoot> Also without a vac seal that'll go bad...

[02:19:35] <Satin> MootPoot: ill eat it over the next week
[02:19:39] <Bco1981> also probably would get more for your money chopping it up yourself
[02:19:44] <MootPoot> Problem with salad is that it'll be digested too fast 
[02:19:54] <MootPoot> Even if you like it, you'll be hungry quick

[03:07:36] <MootPoot> that's the point of public services - to create or maintian things which are required but cannot be sustained under a profit motive
[03:07:57] <MootPoot> the US highway and road system was created through taxes

[03:08:15] <Satin> american suburbs do not make money, it takes a lot to establish those sewer lines, those roads, and basic wide-laned stroads infrastructure
[03:08:34] <Satin> and people don't pay enough taxes to actually cover all of that

[03:19:12] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: tbh if I have to move to tx.. I would buy a place in CA also
[03:19:25] <ButterNoodle> if we man sex can I get dual citizenship?
[03:19:31] <MootPoot> sure
[03:19:54] <ButterNoodle> cant be part of the brother husbands that redphoenix was collecting on irc...
[03:19:58] <ButterNoodle> since she left
[03:20:01] <Satin> The taxes in suburbia are simply not enough in many cases to cover the cost of road/street maintaininece, clean water supply, functional costly sewers and their water treatment plants, the emergency services for that area, and more.

[03:20:15] <Satin> and wheras cities can cover those costs by sheer growth and volume increase
[03:20:19] <Satin> suburbias stay static
[03:20:30] <ButterNoodle> Satin: yea thats why my city sold the water plant to a company
[03:20:33] <Satin> so they can't even evolve to pay more 
[03:20:39] <ButterNoodle> everything gets privatized
[03:20:44] <ButterNoodle> so its not their problem
[03:20:48] <ButterNoodle> same w the roads
[03:20:54] <Satin> ButterNoodle: and they get paid by who
[03:21:03] <ButterNoodle> residents
[03:21:07] <ButterNoodle> at a higher cost
[03:21:18] <Satin> how much do they pay over there for that?
[03:21:23] <ButterNoodle> this is whats happening everywhere
[03:21:27] <Satin> def in my suburb back in kc and adjoining suburbs
[03:21:29] <Satin> it's not like that
[03:21:29] <MootPoot> money
[03:21:35] <Satin> we have a <city name> water company etc
[03:21:39] <Satin> our heating is a company tho
[03:21:48] <ButterNoodle> wdym.. my utility bills went up 30% after getting privatized...
[03:21:53] <Satin> but, in general at this time, so, effectively, we're subsidizing suburbs which are unsustainable
[03:21:54] <ButterNoodle> no more shitty water tho
[03:22:03] <Satin> and not even growing
[03:22:06] <ButterNoodle> yea we use to have city owned
[03:22:09] <ButterNoodle> but
[03:22:14] <Satin> they're good at first, but then a few life cycleslater, sheesh
[03:22:25] <ButterNoodle> everything is either getting contracted out, or sold off to privatized companies
[03:22:33] <ButterNoodle> look at the criminal justice system
[03:22:37] <MootPoot> I think by my math
[03:22:40] <ButterNoodle> the prisons are literally all contractors
[03:22:44] <ButterNoodle> *meth
[03:22:45] <MootPoot> I'm losing like 200g of weight a day
[03:22:46] <Satin> yeah that's lame as hell
[03:22:48] <MootPoot> I think
[03:22:53] <ButterNoodle> wel
[03:22:56] <Satin> MootPoot: i've been losing a pound recently
[03:23:04] <ButterNoodle> thats why they arent losing moneyt
[03:23:04] <Satin> i'm exaggerating
[03:23:04] <Satin> idk
[03:23:08] <MootPoot> r u fa
[03:23:09] <MootPoot> t
[03:23:20] <Satin> probably?
[03:23:21] <Satin> lol
[03:23:23] <MootPoot> you never told me your actual weight
[03:23:25] <MootPoot> lol
[03:23:30] <ButterNoodle> politicians will always find a way to cum out on top and fuck their voters
[03:23:35] <MootPoot> I'm on about month 2 or so of sober
[03:23:46] <Satin> LMAO sober
[03:23:50] <MootPoot> 104 down from 109
[03:24:05] <Satin> 109 lbs??
[03:24:08] <MootPoot> kg
[03:24:12] <Satin> idk what that is in lbs
[03:24:15] <MootPoot> fat
[03:24:15] <ButterNoodle> ik I got fucked when they decided septic was out.. sewers are in.. its ok.. all paid for in bond and taxes
[03:24:21] <ButterNoodle> change of office..
[03:24:37] <Satin> we need denser more sustainable housing in general though
[03:24:39] <MootPoot> Satin: I should be a normal ish weight sometime next year
[03:24:39] <ButterNoodle> new mayor sticks a $32,000 bill in my mail box and says pay up or get sued
[03:24:44] <Satin> zoning laws are horrid
[03:24:56] <ButterNoodle> *still got fucked
[03:24:57] <Satin> and so disgustingly car centric
[03:25:00] <Satin> ButterNoodle: damm
[03:25:10] <ButterNoodle> and that shit has nothing to do with cars
[03:25:18] <Satin> it does have stuff to do with cars
[03:25:22] <ButterNoodle> cars arent the problem
[03:25:24] <ButterNoodle> people are 
[03:25:32] <MootPoot> people arent the problem
[03:25:33] <Satin> car centric design is a real problem.
[03:25:34] <MootPoot> cats are
[03:25:37] <Satin> Stroads.
[03:25:39] <Satin> It affects people
[03:25:51] <ButterNoodle> yea but these towns didnt just pop up
[03:25:56] <Satin> I like my car and cars should remain fine, but in denser urban clusters? car centric design is horrid
[03:25:57] <ButterNoodle> they have been here for ever
[03:26:01] <Satin> not forever
[03:26:07] <Satin> they specifically came up because of the FHA being retarded
[03:26:08] <ButterNoodle> *many years
[03:26:09] <Satin> that's how
[03:26:11] <ButterNoodle> 100s
[03:26:22] <ButterNoodle> louisville is a good example
[03:26:38] <ButterNoodle> people lived in the eastern part of the county.. for the better schools and less crime
[03:26:45] <Satin> Federal Housing Authority's guidelines weren't strict laws but they were who was going to get the mortages and which developers would be subsidized
[03:26:50] <ButterNoodle> then as crime got worse.. people kept moving further ease
[03:26:54] <MootPoot> tbh Satin its not going to change - not until space is at a premium 
[03:26:55] <ButterNoodle> east*
[03:26:56] <Satin> and their stupid guidelines and car centric design ruined shit
[03:27:02] <ButterNoodle> into other municipalities
[03:27:09] <ButterNoodle> building 300K homes
[03:27:15] <Satin> MootPoot: it will change over time lol, gen z in general wants more public transportation
[03:27:23] <MootPoot> in cities
[03:27:25] <MootPoot> I mean suburbia
[03:27:32] <Satin> fuck having to own a car just to go to your local grocery store
[03:27:33] <MootPoot> NA just has soo much sapce

[03:33:10] <Satin> HeTo: 
[03:33:25] <MootPoot> sure, its *possible* but what I'm saying is that with that temp, anyone who has the ability to will end up owning a car

[03:34:07] <Satin> not really
[03:34:09] <MootPoot> people here still use transit, but thats since they have no other option

[07:32:09] <Poeticode> tower of god was damn good. wasn't it like a netflix + SK studio combo?
[07:32:35] <hi117> we can already see it with Chinese anime, but China is such a circle jerk dick sucking that as long as it has Chinese on it it's going to be seen a lot
[07:32:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Just means we'll have to be more selective of the anime we watch so we don't watch the washed down shit.
[07:33:31] <Poeticode> at some point we'll only have the US domestic beer of anime
[07:33:35] <hi117> Poeticode: expect more like that, since no studio in Japan is going to risk something like a studio trigger original again

[07:34:19] <Satin> studio trigger original moment
[07:34:29] <Satin> time to try to study...
[07:34:39] <hi117> but they need to branch out and take risks otherwise they're going to wind up like Hollywood
[07:34:40] <davic> I work with geo data in one project, and one external api we have to use is used by the swedish government bodies
[07:35:06] <davic> and in order to parse the json that they fucking broke is to do a response handler with this shit: response.gsub(/(?<=[0-9]),(?=[0-9]+(,|\n|E))/, '.')
[07:36:47] <hi117> sorry, I only speak contextual grammar not context-free grammar
[07:36:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> davic: That's bad.
[07:37:05] <davic> Aurora_v_kosmose: yes

[07:37:29] <davic> but hey atleast its public data so :shrug"

[09:08:20] <davic> it takes more than 25seconds to fetch one the endpoints
[09:08:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> YOu basically need to implement a non-compliant JSON parser to use it.

[09:08:53] <davic> its beautiful
[09:09:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's an incredible level of fucking up. They might as well have made it an XML endpoint instead, at least there's no spec-defined expectations for number formatting.

[09:15:52] <davic> Aurora_v_kosmose: dont get me started on stockholm county and the famous school system
[09:16:57] <davic> The Skolplattform, which has cost more than 1 billion Swedish Krona, SEK, ($117 million), has failed to match its initial ambition. Parents and teachers have complained about the complexity of the system—its launch was delayed, there have been reports of project mismanagement, and it has been labeled an IT disaster. The Android version of the app has an average 1.2 star rating.

[09:17:08] <ImoutoBot> [title] These parents built a school app. Then the city called the cops | Ars Technica
[09:17:10] <davic> so that happened
[09:17:32] <davic> The work started at the end of November 2020, just days after Stockholm’s Board of Education was hit with a 4 million SEK GDPR fine for “serious shortcomings” in the Skolplattform. Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten, Sweden’s data regulator, had found serious flaws in the platform that had exposed the data of hundreds of thousands of parents, children, and teachers. In some cases, people’s personal information could be accessed from Google searches.
[09:17:35] <davic> it was glorious
[09:17:39] <davic> the gov. fee:d the gov.

[10:39:53] <Cryowolf> meh
[10:40:12] <Cryowolf> Satin, are you having headaches?
[10:40:21] <Satin> not currently no
[10:40:36] <Cryowolf> how long has it been since you started and how low is your carb intake?
[10:40:42] <Satin> 5-6 days
[10:40:52] <Satin> and carb intake idk, i've been trying to avoid altogether?
[10:41:00] <Cryowolf> you can't
[10:41:10] <Satin> came in today through condiments and wonton strips in salad
[10:41:11] <Cryowolf> most things have carbs
[10:41:23] <Cryowolf> except meat
[10:41:24] <Satin> but i've been eating sausages, salads mostly, nuts
[10:41:38] <Cryowolf> sausages contain flour etc
[10:41:41] <Satin> i see yeah
[10:41:42] <Cryowolf> which is carb
[10:41:50] <Satin> but i'd say it's relatively low
[10:41:57] <Satin> my carb intake these past few days
[10:42:07] <Cryowolf> calculate it
[10:42:12] <Satin> aight
[10:42:17] <Cryowolf> weigh what you eat
[10:42:40] <Cryowolf> write down weight and what it is. Don't eat processed food cause they likely contain more carbs
[10:42:58] <Cryowolf> especially sausage, meatballs etc that's frozen or premade
[10:43:23] <ButterNoodle> *check the carbs
[10:43:27] <Cryowolf> they usually put flour and such into it, so you get maybe 20-30g of carbs from one portion
[10:43:38] <Satin> interesting
[10:43:45] <Cryowolf> and that can all be enough to take you out of ketosis
[10:43:51] <Satin> gotcha
[10:43:56] <Cryowolf> to remain in full ketosis you need to be very low on carbs
[10:43:57] <Satin> yea ive been usind premade sausages
[10:44:06] <Satin> noted
[10:44:17] <ButterNoodle> the ones I have are 2g
[10:44:19] <Cryowolf> either buy the more expensive ones that have no flour and such in them, or avoid it
[10:44:24] <ButterNoodle> I eat one, and 2 eggs
[10:44:30] <ButterNoodle> which are about 2 each
[10:44:33] <Satin> i should just switch to eggs
[10:44:36] <Satin> for protein
[10:44:43] <ButterNoodle> u need the fat tho
[10:44:45] <ButterNoodle> use butter
[10:44:52] <Cryowolf> buy shirataki noodles or similar if you want something to replace pasta with
[10:44:52] <Satin> i c
[10:44:57] <Cryowolf> they have basically no carbs
[10:45:03] <Satin> i have no desire for carb foods or pasta tbh

[10:46:13] <Satin> I've eaten it before but i don't eat it often at all
[10:46:19] <Satin> maybe once or twice a year lol
[10:46:28] <Satin> so not particularly
[10:46:43] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, the noodles I mean are based on some plant that has a fiber that is bound together into the shape of noodles. It's not soluable so it wont be digested
[10:47:00] <Cryowolf> Satin, oh cause I know just the right replacement for potato
[10:47:36] <Satin> i don't eat much potato iin the first place in gneral, but what do you have in mind?
[10:47:38] <Cryowolf> Which would be Daikon. If you prepare it right, it will lose its bitter taste

[11:08:12] <Cryowolf> cucumber, iceberg lettuce, paprika etc you can use in your own salad mix and some dressing as long as the dressing is low carb (typically italian is, at least in Sweden) and calculate carbs per 100gs in your finished mix. Then make sure you don't eat more than alloted
[11:08:41] <Cryowolf> if you want to stay in full ketosis, there's a hard limit of 20-30g of carbs
[11:08:43] <MootPoot> you still need to carb cycle once a month anyways Satin 
[11:08:46] <Cryowolf> a day
[11:08:52] <MootPoot> so you can just go ham on indian food that one day
[11:08:57] <Cryowolf> I never carb cycled
[11:08:59] <Cryowolf> you dont need to
[11:09:01] <MootPoot> at least for me its about monthly
[11:09:05] <MootPoot> if I dont I stop losing weight
[11:09:14] <Cryowolf> there's no reason to
[11:09:20] <MootPoot> for you?
[11:09:30] <Cryowolf> nah that plateau is most likely water retention
[11:09:34] <MootPoot> sure, but for me as I said, I stop losing weight if I dont
[11:09:39] <Cryowolf> that will drop after a few days or a week or two
[11:09:52] <MootPoot> 2 months into this diet, I dont think its water retention anymore
[11:09:57] <MootPoot> lol
[11:09:58] <Cryowolf> as long as you expend more kcal than you eat
[11:10:01] <Cryowolf> youll lose weight
[11:10:14] <Cryowolf> unless of course you've starved your body
[11:10:20] <MootPoot> yeah but that's what I'm saying I noticed changed in my metabolism about then
[11:10:21] <Cryowolf> then it will lower its expenditure
[11:10:26] <MootPoot> lower energy in the evening etc
[11:10:36] <MootPoot> my body gets used to keto and cuts calories use
[11:10:39] <Cryowolf> then you probably have too low intake
[11:10:39] <MootPoot> unless I carb cycle
[11:10:56] <Cryowolf> whats your caloric intake per day and your expenditure?
[11:10:58] <Satin> wtf is carb cycling
[11:11:11] <MootPoot> Satin: keto, then about once a month you eat like 100g or more carbs
[11:11:14] <Cryowolf> being on more than 1000kcal deficit is pretty bad
[11:11:23] <MootPoot> I'm on like a 300 or 400
[11:11:28] <Cryowolf> alright
[11:11:45] <MootPoot> I dont know my exact use, but I eat about 1600 a day and I lose about 200g of weight a day
[11:11:47] <Cryowolf> well then tell Satin that if he plateaus, he can carb cycle
[11:11:51] <MootPoot> from my math
[11:12:12] <MootPoot> he?
[11:12:16] <Cryowolf> 1600 a day, a typical adult male will burn 2500-3000 a day

[11:13:38] <Cryowolf> youll be back in ketosis within a day or two anyway
[11:13:39] <MootPoot> keto is short for ketosis, body goes into eating fat for energy mode
[11:13:48] <Cryowolf> ketones!
[11:13:55] <MootPoot> key-pair
[11:14:19] <Cryowolf> youll feel sluggish etc for 2-3 weeks if you carb deplete fast and stay at max 20-30g a day
[11:14:22] <Cryowolf> headache too
[11:14:31] <Cryowolf> but headache can be fixed by increasing salt intake
[11:14:53] <Cryowolf> the reason for the headache is typically water loss, water that holds sodium and other electrolytes
[11:14:55] <MootPoot> I wonder what nutrition sicence will be like in 2040
[11:15:12] <Cryowolf> so replacing those will fix the headaches
[11:15:28] <MootPoot> there has to be a limited amount of knowledge about food munching
[11:15:29] <Cryowolf> the sluggishness you just have to wait until your body has switched over to ketones and adapted
[11:15:35] <MootPoot> maybe by 2040 we'll actually know everything
[11:15:40] <Cryowolf> maybe
[11:16:16] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, I would still up my caloric intake to 2000 if I were you. Unless you're rather short
[11:16:16] *** Quits: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@120.89.104.43) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:16:23] <Cryowolf> then 1600 is good :p
[11:16:36] <MootPoot> you callin me short!!!

[11:16:54] <MootPoot> I'm like 104 kg atm, and 176cm
[11:16:56] <MootPoot> short ish
[11:17:00] <MootPoot> taller then Satin though
[11:17:03] <MootPoot> so thats okay
[11:17:06] <Cryowolf> then 2000 should be fine
[11:17:11] <MootPoot> I consider my shorter height an advantage
[11:17:17] <MootPoot> I can 69 better
[11:17:20] <MootPoot> :3
[11:17:20] <Cryowolf> Satin probably needs to be at 1500-1800 per day
[11:17:28] <Cryowolf> women burn less than men
[11:17:35] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: even if I'm like bascially entirely sedentary?
[11:18:00] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, with your weight etc you'd still be near 2500-2800 unless youre bedridden all day
[11:18:12] <MootPoot> I bascially am
[11:18:19] <MootPoot> I sit at a computer all day
[11:18:21] <MootPoot> I live indoors
[11:18:23] <Cryowolf> you dont sit at a desk?
[11:18:27] <MootPoot> yeah
[11:18:28] <MootPoot> desk
[11:18:33] <Cryowolf> sitting burns more calories than lying down
[11:18:37] <MootPoot> the most I do is just walking up and down stairs
[11:18:53] <Cryowolf> little activies throughout the day can add
[11:19:04] <Cryowolf> but if you just lie down all day and do nothing, you probably burn like 2300
[11:19:10] <Satin> interesting
[11:19:10] <MootPoot> I wanna get a beat saber routine back and running
[11:19:21] <Cryowolf> if you sit and do some basic stuff, it's probably 2500-2800
[11:19:39] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm going to be a reactionary cringelord and start calling this the blue tax - men have to eat more then women
[11:19:46] <MootPoot> lololoololololo
[11:19:50] <Cryowolf> kek
[11:19:57] <Cryowolf> we do though, women burn far less than men
[11:20:02] <Cryowolf> like 25-30% less
[11:20:24] <Cryowolf> or if the man works out and has a lot of muscle, 40-50% less
[11:20:26] <Satin> bruh
[11:20:34] <Satin> MootPoot: what are some easy meat dishes
[11:20:39] <Satin> like shit easy meat dishes
[11:20:40] <Satin> simple
[11:20:47] <Cryowolf> you just asking him?
[11:20:49] <Satin> with not-pre-processed meat
[11:20:49] <MootPoot> depends
[11:20:51] <Satin> Cryowolf: you too
[11:20:57] <MootPoot> do you want to use a knife?
[11:20:59] <MootPoot> yes or no
[11:21:02] <Satin> no
[11:21:13] <Satin> does a knife make a big difference
[11:21:15] <MootPoot> well, you have to open the package at least :3
[11:21:16] <Cryowolf> pork chops, buy them in finished slices and make sure no carbs are added
[11:21:21] <MootPoot> lololololol
[11:21:30] <Satin> hmmm i see
[11:21:30] <MootPoot> Satin: for food, no, but for taste, yes
[11:21:30] <Cryowolf> well a knife would make it easier and cheaper
[11:21:38] <MootPoot> smaller bits - more spread out seasoning
[11:21:40] <Cryowolf> since you can make more types of food
[11:21:43] <MootPoot> ^
[11:21:44] <MootPoot> that too
[11:21:49] <Satin> okay
[11:21:52] <Satin> then ill learn to use a knife.
[11:21:53] <MootPoot> Satin: you're going to cough up money for a meat thermometer
[11:21:58] <MootPoot> to make it as dumb proof as possible
[11:22:01] <Satin> MootPoot: are those at walmart too
[11:22:05] <Cryowolf> some cuts of pork contain lots of fat which can make longer cooked stews taste better cause the meat wont become dry
[11:22:09] <MootPoot> Satin: how do you now know how to use a knife
[11:22:11] <MootPoot> wtf
[11:22:18] <Cryowolf> but you need to make smaller slices for stew
[11:22:27] <MootPoot> like you dont need to learn some cringe youtube "chef knife skills"
[11:22:33] <MootPoot> just use a knife and not cut yourself
[11:22:34] <MootPoot> thats it
[11:22:40] <Satin> MootPoot: not the knife usage itself
[11:22:43] <Cryowolf> using a knife is as easy as taking a piss
[11:22:44] <Satin> but knowing where to cut
[11:22:45] <Satin> i assume
[11:22:54] <MootPoot> oh, yeah, I have a workaround for that
[11:23:03] <Satin> ofc using the knife itself isn't the issue cmon
[11:23:05] <MootPoot> Satin: also meat thermometers, get them from amazon, really

[11:41:13] <Satin> $25 for delievery here and itll arrive after christmas
[11:41:17] <MootPoot> LOL
[11:41:18] <Cryowolf> oh ouch
[11:41:18] <MootPoot> rip
[11:41:25] <Satin> $6 delivery added*
[11:41:29] <Cryowolf> well check if walamrt has Fiskars
[11:41:44] <Satin> which makes it $25
[11:41:45] <MootPoot> IRL stores usually only have their own shit brands
[11:41:50] <Satin> anyways
[11:41:53] <Satin> do you guys use hotspots?
[11:41:57] <Satin> pressure cookers?
[11:42:01] <MootPoot> no, yes
[11:42:07] <MootPoot> not for keto
[11:42:08] <MootPoot> though
[11:42:20] <Cryowolf> oh wow fiskars is quite expensive in the US
[11:42:22] <MootPoot> I mainly just use a frying pan and a toaster oven for 95% of my uses
[11:42:26] <PancakeMatsuri> no, I'm a simpleton
[11:42:26] <Cryowolf> maybe cause its a Scandinavian brand
[11:42:31] <Cryowolf> so importing to the US costs
[11:42:40] <Satin> never heard of fiskars
[11:42:46] <Satin> MootPoot: nice
[11:42:58] <Satin> ok then i have nothing else to order from amazon besides the thermonmeter

[11:43:11] <Cryowolf> Fiskars is a medium to high end Scandinavian brand
[11:43:31] <Cryowolf> but the knives I see for 3-5 euro in Sweden are 20 euro in the US

[11:43:44] <Cryowolf> thats a big difference

[11:44:08] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, unless they're very cheap, bent, very few layers
[11:44:09] <MootPoot> I highly doubt you'll be able to get a unusuable knife
[11:44:14] <Cryowolf> with warping
[11:44:28] *** Parts: teuper (~Thunderbi@218.77.109.6) ()
[11:44:32] <Cryowolf> that would make them hard to cut with
[11:44:34] <MootPoot> even the bargain basement knives these days are fine
[11:44:36] <MootPoot> really
[11:44:44] <MootPoot> ( until they get dull ) 
[11:44:59] <Cryowolf> and contrary to popular belief, youre more likely to harm yourself badly on a bad knife than a very sharp one
[11:45:12] <MootPoot> I generally find that I prefer shorter knives
[11:45:18] *** Joins: Thymo (~Thymo@NASSP/developer/Thymo)
[11:45:19] <MootPoot> I like 6" chef knives over 8
[11:45:24] <Cryowolf> cause you have to use more force and if the grip is bad and it's warped, you might end up slipping and cutting yourself
[11:45:26] <MootPoot> 8 is a bit annoying to deal with
[11:45:37] <Cryowolf> my meat knife is 8"
[11:45:38] <PancakeMatsuri> it's gotta be very dull
[11:45:40] <Cryowolf> veggie knife is 6"
[11:45:46] <Bco1981> it's a knife... not a sword
[11:45:57] <MootPoot> standard chef knife is 8
[11:46:02] <MootPoot> 8 is akward for me
[11:46:10] <MootPoot> I work faster with a 6
[11:47:27] <MootPoot> I use 3 knives - a victorniox paring knife, which is basically a single layer of stamped steel
[11:48:10] <MootPoot> a 6" chef knife, and one of these 8" long chinese vegetable knifes
[11:48:13] <MootPoot> forgot what they're called
[11:48:21] <MootPoot> the rectangle ones

[11:49:10] <Satin> ariba ariba 
[11:49:59] <Cryowolf> PancakeMatsuri, knives with very few layers that are warped or not straight tend to make cutting more difficult is what I meant
[11:50:33] <Cryowolf> you can't get them as sharp and the warping or bending will make the handling worse, especially if the handle is bad
[11:50:48] <PancakeMatsuri> Cryowolf warped? Luckily, didn't happen to me
[11:51:02] <Cryowolf> my next knife purchase is going to be damascus steel
[11:51:20] <Cryowolf> cause I think they're just really gorgeous
[11:51:26] <MootPoot> kind of Cryowolf 
[11:51:29] <MootPoot> it depends on the knife
[11:51:47] <MootPoot> if its a paring knife, they are supposed to be razor thin with 1 or at most 2 layers
[11:51:57] <MootPoot> to make really small veggie cuts
[11:52:00] <Cryowolf> my first knife set were 3 knives for 7 dollars at IKEA
[11:52:16] <Cryowolf> they were very bad at cutting
[11:52:17] <MootPoot> I like that Satin bascially turned this channel into ##cooking
[11:52:30] <MootPoot> I have a legit japanese made hand made knife Cryowolf 
[11:52:37] <MootPoot> got as a hand me down 
[11:52:42] <MootPoot> although I dont use it lmao
[11:52:43] <Cryowolf> few layer knives are of course made for stuff
[11:52:44] <MootPoot> too much of a pain
[11:52:53] <Satin> MootPoot: you and butter already make it into cooking i think
[11:53:08] <Cryowolf> but having a single layer knife for cutting meat

[14:58:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: oh?
[14:59:15] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: just surprised on how many people think history is true or even monolithic
[14:59:30] <DunceCotus> the sous chefs of history would like a word
[14:59:54] <amigojapan> Sous?
[15:00:13] <DunceCotus> sous chefs
[15:00:38] <amigojapan> Ok, let me Google that
[15:00:41] <DunceCotus> A sous-chef de cuisine, or simply sous-chef, is a chef who is "the second in command in a kitchen; the person ranking next after the executive chef." Consequently, the sous-chef holds much responsibility in the kitchen, which can eventually lead to promotion to becoming the executive chef.
[15:01:05] <amigojapan> Oh pinche in Spanish
[15:01:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the histors write the victory
[15:02:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think that saying needs modification. Everyone wires history, the wines the losers and everyone and their cousin
[15:02:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: at any point in time it seems there are large swathes of people with a patchy understanding of reality
[15:02:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: of course everyone writes history
[15:03:11] <DunceCotus> its just that the history books we read is the edited version
[15:03:15] <DunceCotus> edited by those in power
[15:03:30] <DunceCotus> or those who are affiliated with institutions who work for those in power etc.
[15:03:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: those in power in different countries, so the history contradicts
[15:04:07] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: only on minor details
[15:04:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: generally those in power have world power
[15:04:22] <DunceCotus> they can manipulate all historical accounts
[15:04:40] <DunceCotus> because to disseminate the accounts means going through their markets, their regulatory system etc.
[15:05:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Japan is trying hard to eliminate the fact of Japanese soldiers forcing Korean women into prostitution
[15:05:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: only way to get past it is to call it fiction, but then you have a credibility problem
[15:05:32] <DunceCotus> in the eyes of the academics
[15:06:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: oh I'm sure they are
[15:06:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe it's a fiction based on some true things
[15:07:03] <DunceCotus> basically its inconceivable to go by any one account of history
[15:07:26] <DunceCotus> but much of the world operates on a few select accounts of history
[15:07:29] <DunceCotus> depending on the region
[15:07:37] <DunceCotus> which align with the interests of those in power 
[15:09:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the way to get out from under this is to turn away at least temporarily from the strata
[15:09:20] <DunceCotus> there's more at work here than any one timeline

[15:11:57] <ImoutoBot> [title] 慰安婦 - Wikipedia
[15:13:16] <DunceCotus> wikipedia really shouldn't be trusted when it comes to history
[15:14:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but Japanese text books for school don't mention it
[15:15:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: wikipedia is willing to mention scandals with the official narratives here and there
[15:15:21] <DunceCotus> but ultimately that serves to bolster official narratives, not do away with them
[15:15:31] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:16:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: anything remotely controversial to official narratives is not found on wikipedia
[15:16:10] <DunceCotus> it gets removed before you even post it
[15:16:39] <DunceCotus> in part because the citations are pretty flimsy
[15:16:53] <DunceCotus> but its clear they want no dissenting voices on wiki
[15:16:57] <Sapphirus> Wikipedia in general can be unreliable.
[15:17:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the editors require sitations
[15:17:05] <DunceCotus> has to be all backed up in official history books etc
[15:17:15] <Sapphirus> I've opened citations for claims and the opposite is made in the scientific papers.
[15:17:21] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: definitely parts of it are
[15:17:39] <DunceCotus> not only is it unreliable, its gatekept 
[15:18:13] <Sapphirus> Definitely true. I don't even think this is exclusive to western wikipedia. 
[15:18:55] <DunceCotus> no those in power have taken over the internet (well it was always theirs to begin with, but moreso nowadays), all information is filtered
[15:19:13] <Sapphirus> Facts don't matter so much as the feelings which dictate the editor's politics.
[15:19:14] <DunceCotus> information that is truly dissenting gets put on bottom of the pile, not even removed, just not locatable
[15:20:18] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: and the editor's politics align with the dominant powers'
[15:20:26] <DunceCotus> because that's how you get the job
[15:20:27] <Sapphirus> Pretty much
[15:20:56] <DunceCotus> the internet is a shell of what it was
[15:21:05] <DunceCotus> I'd say 90% bots if not more
[15:21:19] <DunceCotus> everyone's funnelled into echo chambers and social media ghettos
[15:21:32] <DunceCotus> those 'lucky' few real users
[15:22:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this corresponds with the timeline shifting
[15:22:24] <DunceCotus> the internet may have actually inadvertently connected people from conflicting timelines
[15:22:35] <Sapphirus> Monocultures have almost become like a mind virus.
[15:22:39] <DunceCotus> so those in power had to shut that down, erecting walls for each user individually
[15:23:23] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: well we are placed in the tubs
[15:24:49] <DunceCotus> one can get comfortable in their pre-assigned tub
[15:24:55] <Sapphirus> I honestly wouldn't be surprised if internet comment sections are at the very least half-composed of bots or paid shills.
[15:25:27] <Sapphirus> On social media sites like Reddit and whatnot, you end up having to scroll a bit on more popular threads to see organic commentary.
[15:25:46] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: right
[15:26:08] <DunceCotus> and then its kinda sad seeing the organic commentary come to resemble the bots and shill posts
[15:26:17] <Sapphirus> yep..
[15:26:46] <DunceCotus> but I think something else must be at work than nefarious social engineering of internet opinions
[15:27:22] <DunceCotus> perhaps it is the result of monolithic social networks penning most users into their services
[15:27:50] <DunceCotus> but it could also be they are trying to not have us communicate with real people as much, because that's unstable to their narratives
[15:28:00] <amigojapan> Back. I was throwing away the garbage
[15:28:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: wb
[15:29:22] <Sapphirus> DunceCotus, yeah, that is also a possibility. Opinions people hold in real life opposed to what you see on social media has quite a stark contrast.
[15:30:25] <Sapphirus> I don't feel this heavy feeling out in the public atmosphere no more. Seems like the COVID doomer mentality is isolated to the internet now.

[17:01:22] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I bet you would not poison yourself to death
[17:01:41] <darkwitch> that would take a lot of coffee
[17:03:21] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I think caffeine can cause a heart attack in predisposed people

[17:10:01] <amigojapan> darkwitch: not sure if it is true but my mom told me that air in your blood vessels could kill you
[17:10:32] <Bco1981> i have heard that too.
[17:11:14] <amigojapan> Bco1981: from your mom?
[17:11:29] <Bco1981> no
[17:11:36] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[17:12:09] <amigojapan> Better not tell tomako
[17:12:23] <Bco1981> that is why they always make sure there is no air in a syringe before injections
[17:12:45] <amigojapan> Yeah that's what my mom told me Bco1981 
[17:16:45] <amigojapan> Bco1981: "Human case reports suggest that injecting more than 100 mL of air into the venous system at rates greater than 100 mL/s can be fatal.
[17:18:52] <darkwitch> like lots of bubbles in your blood
[17:19:15] <darkwitch> not great, but a little bubble won't harm you
[17:19:27] <Bco1981> i would think one big bubble of air.
[17:19:49] <amigojapan> This sounds like dangerous knowledge
[17:20:41] <darkwitch> I started musking up my clothes
[17:20:45] <amigojapan> Good thing syringes are not sold in Japan to commoners
[17:21:01] <amigojapan> !c musking
[17:21:02] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: I don't know.
[17:21:17] <amigojapan> !c musk
[17:21:18] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Musk is a class of aromatic substances commonly used as base notes in perfumery. They include glandular secretions from animals such as the musk deer, numerous plants emitting similar fragrances, and artificial substances with similar odors.
[17:22:23] <amigojapan> darkwitch: how does it smell?
[17:22:39] <darkwitch> laundry detergent and fabric softener is full of them
[17:22:48] <amigojapan> Ah
[17:23:53] <darkwitch> so if you take away any additional smells of flowers and fruits or whatever, it smells like freshly laundered clothes
[17:24:13] <darkwitch> only because that has been going on for so long
[17:24:14] <amigojapan> That sounds pleasant
[17:24:22] <amigojapan> I see
[17:26:04] <darkwitch> galaxolide is your basic boring musk with not much of a particular smell
[17:26:35] <amigojapan> Never heard of it
[17:27:39] <darkwitch> I'm sure there are 50-100 to choose from, many ending in "-lide"
[17:28:23] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I think I have heard of "morning musk
[17:29:20] <darkwitch> like Habanolide, Tonalide, Celestolide, Fixalide, Helvetolide, Ambrettolide, Exaltolide, Edenolide, etc.
[17:31:38] <darkwitch> one of the first was https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/molecule-of-the-week/archive/m/musk-ketone.html

[19:25:45] <zoidberg> there is government food service where anyone could buy meals which is damn cheap Satin. It's 5 INR.
[19:25:49] <Satin> eating healthier actually costs a bit more here, as weird as that sounds

[19:26:38] <Satin> small businesses and diners aren't as common as they used to be here in the US
[19:26:39] <zoidberg> I understood.
[19:27:25] <Satin> obviously if you know what you're doing you can be poor and eat healthy as well

[23:48:45] <Satin> MootPoot: that doesn't sound right
[23:48:47] <MootPoot> I remembered I needed to replace a 6" one I got

[23:48:49] <MootPoot> what

[23:48:55] <Satin> fair.
[23:49:02] <Satin> 6" replacement
[23:49:06] <MootPoot> its too thick and dulls

[23:49:56] <Satin> just kidding
[23:50:02] <MootPoot> :3
[23:50:04] <MootPoot> perv
[23:50:10] <Satin> your fault
[23:50:14] <MootPoot> fair

[23:51:15] <Omega037> I know when I slam into my wife too hard, it hurts her
[23:51:23] <Omega037> So I am guessing there are some in the back near the cervix
[23:51:31] <MootPoot> I never said there were none
[23:51:38] <MootPoot> I just said *most* are up front
[23:51:58] <Omega037> That is why it can be fun to do a full pull out and back in
[23:52:10] <MootPoot> Satin: you started this convo
[23:52:11] <Omega037> But it slows things down if you don't want a bent cock

[23:52:37] <Omega037> But just the tip ;)
[23:52:40] <MootPoot> lol
[23:53:00] <Omega037> Anyways, I am back into reading manga/manhua/manwha
[23:53:12] <Omega037> I found an app for my phone called Tachiyomi
[23:53:28] <MootPoot> Sadale: 99% of what I do in the kitchen can be done with a 6" chef knife and a 3-4" paring knife
[23:53:33] <MootPoot> oh Omega037 I use that one too
[23:53:38] <Omega037> Works great with webtoons that you can do continuous scrolldown
[23:53:40] <MootPoot> its a bit slow to load with some sites though
[23:53:50] <Omega037> Of course, I think the size of my phone starts to hurt my eyes a bit
[23:53:54] <MootPoot> and the downloading dosen alwasy phone
[23:54:01] <Omega037> MootPoot, it did take a while to find good sources
[23:54:03] <MootPoot> dosen't always work*
[23:54:05] <Omega037> But you can pre-download
[23:54:13] <Omega037> And there are like 500 sites
[23:54:17] <MootPoot> like 20% of my listed manga are like
[23:54:20] <MootPoot> 404 errors
[23:54:21] <MootPoot> lol
[23:54:38] <Omega037> My problem is more that I get into ongoing manga and then binge to current
[23:54:52] <Omega037> So you are really into the story, and then it is a weekly (at best) drip for the next 5 years
[23:55:04] <Omega037> And I eventually lose interest
[23:55:16] <MootPoot> I know the feeling
[23:55:32] <MootPoot> its bad in tachiyomi as well
[23:55:46] <MootPoot> since you're never 100% sure if there are no new chapters
[23:55:51] <MootPoot> or your source hasen't updated
[23:56:04] <Omega037> Well, I generally look up stuff online
[23:56:11] <Omega037> On sites Tachi does well on
[23:56:21] <Omega037> What would be amazing is syncing between devices
[23:56:29] <MootPoot> ikr
[23:56:32] <Omega037> So if you read on the site, it updates your place
[23:56:36] <MootPoot> but they'd need a server for that
[23:56:43] <MootPoot> or local docker host
[23:56:45] <Omega037> I have a NextCloud server
[23:57:00] <Omega037> I sync notes and calendars and files and stuff in my house
[23:57:08] <Omega037> Honestly, I probably have the skills to do it
[23:57:12] <Poeticode> what are those cafes called in japan where you talk to randos?
[23:57:27] <Omega037> Poeticode, for a foreigner it is every cafe
[23:57:36] <Poeticode> lmao
[23:57:37] <Omega037> Cafes tended to be themed though
[23:57:38] <MootPoot> oh wait Omega037 there is chapter tracking
[23:57:40] <MootPoot> check settings
[23:57:44] <Poeticode> i think amigojapan went to one
[23:57:47] <MootPoot> tracking
[23:57:50] <Poeticode> but he prolly asleep
[23:57:52] <Omega037> Izakayas are like normal bars
[23:58:21] <Omega037> Snack bars are sorta like half bar, have strip joint
[23:58:26] <Omega037> But without the stripping
[23:58:37] <Omega037> Not what I would call a "cafe" though
