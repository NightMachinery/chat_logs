[05:20:50] <Voxel> I solved Semantle #22 in 456 guesses. My first guess had a similarity of 3.57.  My first word in the top 1000 was at guess #12.  My penultimate guess had a similarity of 34.26 (965/1000). https://semantle.novalis.org/
[05:21:35] <furrykef> I too have the 990/1000 and 992/1000 words.
[05:21:50] <Voxel> I know these ^^
[05:21:53] <furrykef> And 989.
[05:22:01] <Voxel> Yup
[05:22:14] <Voxel> I didn't expect it though
[05:22:29] <Voxel> I mean, you'll get what I mean
[05:22:39] <furrykef> I'm probably about to give up. I can't play this game all day.
[05:22:44] <furrykef> I mean, I can, but :P
[05:22:47] <Voxel> Ha-ha
[05:22:55] <Voxel> Wait some time and try more
[05:23:08] <Voxel> Each word is 24 hours
[05:23:57] <furrykef> Nah, I clicked "Give up". I don't think I'd have gotten it.
[05:24:10] <furrykef> This whole word2vec thing has given me an idea for my game, though.
[05:25:03] <furrykef> My game is about deciphering a language, and this kind of similarity measurement would help the player identify words that are close in meaning.
[05:25:29] <Voxel> Welp, I don't know a decipher which would allow such
[05:25:51] <Voxel> Anywyas, that's awesome, furrykef! I'd really want to try the game if possible!
[05:26:30] <furrykef> I'll make a note of that
[05:26:42] <furrykef> It will probably be a long time before it's ready for that, though
[05:27:23] <Voxel> No problem! I'll wait. What's the programming language, library, framework?

[05:44:24] <Voxel> Some might say, the most important trait of an indie developer is *self reliance*.

[07:13:27] <Voxel> clock; time; male; tunnel; universe; space;
[07:14:04] <furrykef> Yes, it's "time"
[07:14:34] <furrykef> So far we have: ____ time ____ key ____ ____
[07:14:45] *** Quits: basuotoko (~basuotoko@171.94.16.67) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[07:15:18] <furrykef> Now let's take a look at the fifth character. We see that it has "time" as a component
[07:15:46] <furrykef> What does its other component look like?
[07:17:31] <Voxel> up; arrow; pointer; pin; tree; girl; front;
[07:17:32] <Voxel> uptime?
[07:17:36] *** Joins: basuotoko (~basuotoko@171.94.16.67)
[07:18:41] <furrykef> It's "tree"
[07:18:49] <furrykef> So a character that has both "tree" and "time"...
[07:18:55] <furrykef> What might it mean?
[07:19:15] <Voxel> grow?
[07:22:08] <furrykef> No, although that's an interesting possibility I haven't considered
[07:22:21] <furrykef> It wouldn't suit this phrase, though
[07:22:22] <LuisR14> genealogy? family tree? ... :>
[07:22:41] <Voxel> dry; colorize; bear fruit; ripe? 
[07:22:45] <furrykef> All these words are monosyllabic
[07:23:27] <furrykef> Another hint: do you happen to be familiar with how Chinese characters are formed?
[07:23:28] <Voxel> Indeed it would since it's after key
[07:23:31] <LuisR14> (don't even know what's currently happening)
[07:23:46] <Voxel> furrykef, no, I'm not unfortunately..
[07:24:05] <Voxel> However I hope I will in the future.
[07:24:15] <furrykef> LuisR14: Voxel is trying to decipher this: http://www.furrykef.com/offsite/tmp/tpw.png
[07:24:38] <furrykef> OK, well, the vast majority of Chinese characters are what are called radical-phonetic compounds.
[07:24:57] <furrykef> That means part of the character hints at the meaning, or at least the category of the word; the other part hints at how it's pronounced.
[07:25:11] <furrykef> Bearing this in mind... any ideas for "tree+time"?

[07:26:32] <Voxel> Depends on the priority. trim or try, for example.
[07:26:52] <Voxel> Like, what has the most priority the right or the left side.
[07:28:32] <furrykef> Can you think of a type of tree that sounds like "time"?
[07:28:43] <Voxel> Oh
[07:32:46] <furrykef> Voxel?
[07:32:49] <Voxel> Pine, Elm, Tamarack, Tanoak, 
[07:34:38] <furrykef> How about lime?
[07:35:10] <Voxel> Neem, Palm
[07:35:31] <furrykef> Or lime :P
[07:35:47] <Voxel> Didn't know such, but Tilia
[07:35:55] <Voxel> Indeed, I got the idea
[07:35:57] <furrykef> So now we have: ____ time ____ key lime ____
[07:36:14] <furrykef> A "key lime" is a type of lime, by the way
[07:36:25] <furrykef> I admit the puzzle is a little easier if you know that already
[07:36:27] <Voxel> I see
[07:37:29] <furrykef> Let's look at the last word now. These particular elements are a little too abstract, so I'll tell you what they are: "food" and "eye"
[07:37:57] <furrykef> What might food+eye mean?
[07:38:22] <inhahe_> seafood?
[07:38:30] <Voxel> It's about sound, inhahe_ 
[07:38:34] *** Quits: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[07:38:50] <Voxel> Like tree + time is lime
[07:39:00] <Voxel> Where tree is lime as its type
[07:39:31] <furrykef> Yes, exactly
[07:39:40] <furrykef> Though that was still a clever guess.
[07:39:55] <furrykef> It just doesn't happen to fit my particular system
[07:41:10] <inhahe_> fide, as in bona fide ;d
[07:43:04] <furrykef> Not bad, but not the word
[07:43:33] <Voxel> The/A time for key lime file?
[07:43:46] <furrykef> "for" is correct
[07:44:09] <furrykef> Notice there's a bit of a pun on "for" and "four", since there are four arrows
[07:45:03] <Voxel> fine?
[07:45:22] <furrykef> I'll give a hint: a type of food, rhymes with "eye"
[07:45:29] <Voxel> Oh
[07:45:43] <Voxel> pie
[07:45:43] <inhahe_> brie
[07:45:47] <furrykef> Correct, pie
[07:46:02] <Voxel> It's time for key lime pie?
[07:46:11] <furrykef> Very close
[07:46:29] <furrykef> The pictogram for the first one is a little hard to understand, so I'll tell you what it's supposed to represent: a thumbs-down
[07:48:09] <Voxel> Hm...
[07:49:49] <Voxel> Oh, I see the hand
[07:50:20] <Voxel> Niceee
[07:50:39] *** Joins: redempt1on (~rer@107-190-27-93.cpe.teksavvy.com)
[07:51:44] <Voxel> This time?
[07:52:20] <furrykef> What does a thumbs-down represent?
[07:52:32] <Voxel> Asked myself 20 times already 
[07:52:37] <furrykef> When somebody gives you that gesture in real life, I mean
[07:52:49] <inhahe_> no
[07:52:54] <furrykef> Correct!
[07:53:00] <Voxel> Oh
[07:53:04] <Voxel> Now that makes sense
[07:53:04] <furrykef> So put it all together now
[07:53:31] <Voxel> No time for key lime pie!
[07:53:48] <Voxel> Hooray! Awesome!
[07:55:11] <furrykef> Woohoo!
[07:55:44] <furrykef> I'll bet that was a workout. I know the puzzle's tough for someone who doesn't already know how the system works
[07:55:46] <Voxel> furrykef, look, I loved it, really! I have a personal cipher which I'll try to patent in the future, but it's graphics, data bit and permutation based.
[07:55:57] <furrykef> Ah, nice.
[07:56:08] <Voxel> So, that one, based on language is awesome because it's very different
[07:56:08] <furrykef> Cryptography has never really been my strong suit, though I know some things about it
[07:57:10] <furrykef> So, this was the idea I had for the game...
[07:57:49] <Voxel> That's an amazing idea and you have to finish it since it's very customizable and I'd say is very usable.
[07:58:07] <Voxel> Like in real world
[07:58:41] <furrykef> At the beginning of the game you are given these documents to decipher, without knowing what language they're in or anything. You start with some very easy texts ("the fox chases the rabbit", under an illustration of this, for example) and work your way up to more complex ones
[07:58:48] <Voxel> Not just char to char, but actual logic behind the scene and nearly no limits
[07:59:16] <furrykef> And as you progress, you learn more about who wrote these documents and why
[07:59:37] <Voxel> furrykef, that looks meaningful and that's how I imagine any such game so it should help players indeed
[08:00:18] <furrykef> It eventually becomes apparent that the language is a form of English, since there are poems that rhyme... and soon the player might notice that words that sound similar to each other in English have similar characters, too
[08:00:50] <furrykef> And eventually the player discovers that he's reading the remains of a lost civilization, an Earth from an alternate dimension where the alphabet was never developed
[08:01:23] <Voxel> That's breathtaking!
[08:01:26] <furrykef> Thanks :3
[08:02:30] <furrykef> And from there it goes something like this...
[08:02:49] <Voxel> No spoilers!
[08:03:14] <furrykef> Oh come on, this game will probably take years to make :P
[08:03:32] <Voxel> What? Really? I give you a year!
[08:03:43] <Voxel> Just kiddin
[08:03:56] <furrykef> The player eventually learns that civilization on the alternate Earth fell due to the rise of a new, dangerous species of bacterium
[08:04:07] <furrykef> They did find a cure, but it was too late
[08:04:20] <furrykef> And now there's a problem... that bacterium is now threatening *our* Earth.
[08:04:52] <Voxel> furrykef, just in case, have you played Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain?
[08:05:05] <furrykef> I have not. I don't mind spoilers, though
[08:05:14] <redempt1on> Thou shalt not bastardize the King's English
[08:05:15] <furrykef> I'm not much of a Metal Gear fan these days

[08:09:13] <furrykef> Voxel: I actually first came up with this plot shortly after COVID-19 was discovered in China. I thought it was going to be another disease like SARS or bird flu... one of those diseases that flares up in some remote part of the world, alarmists scream about it for a month or two, and then it all goes away
[08:09:22] <furrykef> Unfortunately... I turned out to be wrong.

[08:11:31] <furrykef> I'm still trying to think of an alternative plot
[08:11:57] <redempt1on> is this dungeons and dragons?
[08:12:00] <redempt1on> RPG?
[08:12:12] <redempt1on> COVID was just over sensationalized crapola
[08:12:23] <redempt1on> none of their manmade measures made any impact in the spread of the disease

[17:49:20] <inhahe_> any of those works
[17:49:24] <Lebela> I just read a sentence written by somebody in an IRC channel here

[17:50:35] <Lebela> the person wrote:  "...talk to your third-parties to not do stupid things..."
[17:50:47] <Lebela> why did they say:  "to not" rather than "not to" ?
[17:51:42] <inhahe_> not to may be more grammatically correct but it usually feels more or less unnatural

[17:53:03] <Lebela> were you guys just responding to me or to somebody else?
[17:54:12] <inhahe_> one problem with using 'not to' in the above is that it makes it more ambiguous, like you could be saying (talk to your third parties) not to do stupid things, like the talking is the not doing the stupid thing, instead of telling them not to do a stupid thing
[17:54:47] <inhahe_> at least it seems that way to me

[17:57:01] <inhahe_> like you're being not stupid by talking to the third parties
[17:57:09] <inhahe_>  as opposed to telling the third parties to not do stupid things
[17:57:18] <inhahe_> that's the ambiguity that seems to increase if you use "not to" instead of "to not"
[17:57:20] <Lebela> inhahe_, can we express it in pseudo code?
[17:57:42] <inhahe_> did you understand the above?
[17:57:46] <Lebela> tell("3rd_party") { do_not_use_spaces(); }
[17:57:59] <Lebela> would that be "to not" or "not to" ?
[17:58:21] <inhahe_> tell the third party not to use spaces would be more natural sounding
[17:58:52] <Lebela> wait, what?  So my version of it would be correct anyway?!
[17:59:11] <LuisR14> in this case, to not would just make it emphatic
[17:59:14] <Lebela> I was the one wondering why they didn't say "not to" whereas the other person said "to not"
[17:59:51] <Lebela> LuisR14, so, "not to" increases the strength of the statement?
[17:59:52] <inhahe_> Lebela: well, like i said, 'not to x' is always more correct than 'to not x', i just think that doing it the correct way could make it awkward though in the case of the original sentence
[18:00:03] <inhahe_> Lebela: in the case of the pseudocode sentence you gave, it wouldn't be awkward
