[00:31:20] <bomb> some people directly paste base64 on IRC
[00:31:37] <Nasp> I wonder if some sort of binary log format exists
[00:32:37] <cloudbender> So, I'm tring to use a List<string[]> as a datasource for a grid
[00:32:45] <cloudbender> And I am doing it wrong
[00:33:29] <bomb> binary log format sounds very inconvenient
[00:33:58] <Nasp> bomb:  how come?
[00:34:43] <bomb> we'd like to tail/grep/etc. it
[00:35:03] <bomb> but there are time series databases that can be used for logging
[00:35:08] <Nasp> yes
[00:35:20] <Nasp> also timeseries databases are usualyl for metrics
[00:35:32] <Nasp> But i never look in logs raw they are shipped and parsed
[00:35:34] <bomb> usually
[00:35:37] <Nasp> And a binary formay woudl be better for that
[00:36:25] <bomb> gzipping is efficient enough for archival purposes
[00:36:41] <Nasp> json takes up way too much space imo
[00:38:40] <bomb> yeah
[00:40:26] <Nasp> I noticed our current logs take up 600mb of memory under high pressure
[00:40:30] <Nasp> That seems like quite a lot
[00:41:43] <cloudbender> So, for a list<string[]> as a datasource I'm doing this ...
[00:41:46] <cloudbender> https://gist.github.com/cloudbender/d469b125a9cf641bc3192c3f9eedacca
[00:42:01] <bomb> yeah, weird. it should just write to disk with fsync off

[01:30:02] <canton7> cloudbender, list1.Add(new Thing() { Record = "record0", Description = "description0" }) etc?
[01:30:14] <cloudbender> ok
[01:30:23] <canton7> You can see the DataGrid's finding all properties on the object using reflection, then showing each one in its own column
[01:30:41] <canton7> So if you want 'record0' to be in a column called 'Record', then create a property called 'Record' and give it the value 'record0'
[01:30:44] <cloudbender> yup
[01:31:05] <cloudbender> actually 'record' is the prim key

[07:57:23] <cloudbender> We generate our own barcodes from scraped data from P.O.S. reports

[08:04:06] <JakeSays> if he's retiring then he needs to open up

[11:55:09] <lz_> this is anything but honest though

[12:00:55] <lz_> could also be "I'm totally OK with the idea of murdering you" so I'm not sure

[17:51:19] <littlebit> one thing that I have tried was this: https://wellsb.com/csharp/beginners/csharp-list-foreach/
[17:52:49] <Autowired> you question is too hard
[17:53:24] <littlebit> Autowired: ur joking
[17:54:28] <Autowired> the problem with string is that it is immutable. you can't change it
[17:54:37] <Autowired> you have to replace it with a new string
[17:56:12] <Autowired> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22349387/replace-string-values-in-list
[17:56:43] <Autowired> solution: create new list :D
[17:57:28] <littlebit> kk
[17:57:46] <littlebit> thx, thought I was the bumb that is overseeing things...
[18:02:16] <canton7> You can modify the old list for sure -- list[i] = '£' + list[i] or so
[18:03:58] <littlebit> canton7: yeah I could do that, but thought that it was noobish to solve everything with foreach lists
[18:06:22] <canton7> If it involves mutating a collection, foreach loops are the way to go. If you're selecting/filtering/sorting/mapping/etc data to end up with a new collection, linq is good
[18:47:55] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5rLz5AZBIA
[18:49:05] <lz_> lmao this is the most wtf thing I've ever seen: it's no longer possible to authenticate credit card purchases if you don't install their app, unless... UNLESS YOU GIVE THEM YOUR FUCKING ACCOUNT PASSWORD
[18:49:18] <lz_> what the fucking shit fuck shit is this
[18:50:03] <bomb> double fucktor authentication
[18:50:25] <lz_> seriously how does this make any sense?
[18:51:50] <bomb> makes sense for them. access to more data to collect about you
[18:52:13] <lz_> the pretense for which you can't use text messages to authenticate was a "security reason", and now they ask for the master password
[18:53:12] <bomb> this blue planet earth has been turning into a giant stinky shitball
[18:54:54] <lz_> so if i don't want to give them the master password, i have to install this app which would basically give access to my bank account to anyone who steals my phone
[18:54:57] <lz_> wtf
[18:55:26] <MichaelLong> who is them?
[18:55:41] <lz_> MichaelLong: both my bank and payment processors who ask for my bank's password
[18:56:12] <lz_> having bank processors asking for bank *passwords* is a terrible thing to do. Now fishing websites can do it too
[18:56:20] <MichaelLong> sounds very weird
[18:56:58] <lz_> so i installed the app. Now the app wants... to read my text messages lol
[18:58:36] <MichaelLong> I also needed to install an app to verify the credit card purshase, it is using the 3-D secure method also called mastercard identity check
[18:58:48] <irwiss> some bank apps are worse than flashlight apps, siphon everything it can reach on your phone and dump it for mining enough data on you for ads
[18:58:54] <MichaelLong> it does not want any permissions
[18:59:23] <lz_> i didn't give it. I copied the text manualy
[19:00:07] <lz_> it's asking it every time until you misclick and give it to them
[19:00:14] <bomb> I'm preparing to go out of loop for a while. I might even grow my food in the future
[19:01:08] <lz_> they said i can't activate the thing until... 3 fucking days lol
[19:01:22] <lz_> so I can't make credit card purchases for 3 days now, unless I give my master password

[19:04:32] <lz_> yeah "for security reason you can't credit the account you're adding now"
[19:05:44] <MichaelLong> most of the time I use direct debit withdrawal, with a bank transfer you usually cannot get back your money if anything gets wrong
[19:06:11] <lz_> I need to wait 72 hours too lol
[19:06:35] <lz_> and the thing I'm trying to credit expires in 2 days of course
[19:06:49] <MichaelLong> if it is a SEPA transfer it should be done within 24h
[19:07:18] <lz_> my bank website doesn't let me do the transfer for 3 days
[19:07:30] <MichaelLong> why?
[19:07:44] <lz_> because I just added the iban to the iban list I can transfer too
[19:07:54] <MichaelLong> lol what?
[19:08:03] <lz_> they probably do so to avoid malicious people to transfer money out of bank accounts when they get access to them
[19:08:18] <MichaelLong> dude you should seriously consider changing your bank
[19:08:35] <lz_> yeah it's a fucking joke
[19:08:36] <MichaelLong> lz_, but how is that possible having 2fa?
[19:09:04] <lz_> MichaelLong: I don't have 2fa (but I needed my phone to add the iban)
[19:09:11] <MichaelLong> what!?
[19:10:02] <MichaelLong> you're allowed to not have any 2FA mechanism in place?
[19:10:19] <lz_> since they sent a confirmation code to my phone to add the iban I guess it's a sort of 2fa
[19:12:03] <MichaelLong> never heard of such an procedure. here I punch in the IBAN, get my TAN via numerous available methods, e.g. pushTAN, chipTAN, photoTAN and that's it.
[19:12:24] <MichaelLong> I always thought our banking is far behind...
[19:16:12] <littlebit> I have the following line of code: List<string> tempOrSetValues = orSetValues;
[19:16:43] <littlebit> if i modify something in temOrSetValues  orSetValues gets changed
[19:19:04] <lz_> does that work? List<string> tempOrSetValues = new List<string>(orSetValues);
