[00:32:41] <temhawk> tdsmith yeah well I don't necessarily trust myself. that's kinda the whole reason for user accounts even on single-user systems, else why not just be root all the time?
[00:33:08] <temhawk> I still find the example of the booby-trapped `ls` compelling.
[00:34:20] <tdsmith> that amounts to never having a PATH entry that your user account can write to
[00:34:31] <tdsmith> which is a thing you can do i guess
[00:36:02] <tdsmith> although by that point you've already run arbitrary code with full access to your data, so what's the point
[00:36:24] <temhawk> yeah, I typically don't need to overwrite my apps I think? so I thought why not create a dummy user for homebrew so that I can run the tools but can't write to the tools
[00:37:08] <tdsmith> that was the brewdo model, which was a good idea https://github.com/brewdo/brewdo
[00:37:37] <temhawk> I'd do something like `sudo -s brewer brew ...` to use homebrew (a bit inconvenient)
[00:37:39] <temhawk> oh
[00:37:52] <tdsmith> though the threat model it addresses is still a little unclear to me i think
[00:38:18] <tdsmith> it made more sense when homebrew was more likely to build things locally
[00:43:22] <temhawk> I don't quite get what you mean. It's also unclear to me, I was just thinking of how to address the criticism brought up in that blog post. But your brewdo is exactly that. Neat!
[02:33:15] <temhawk> Thanks for your help! Have a nice day! üëã
