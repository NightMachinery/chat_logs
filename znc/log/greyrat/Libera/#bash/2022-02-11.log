[01:27:20] <greybot> Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language.

[03:07:34] <tirnanog> wiscii: I'm not sure you're seeing mine. how search works is a function of your pager. if you don't like it, you can try to find a different one.

[03:22:15] <tirnanog> wiscii: I think you just need to read over the QUOTING section again.
[03:22:23] <wiscii> i am
[03:22:40] <chronon> Unless there's a shopt I can use to disable backticks and test everything.
[03:22:45] <tirnanog> chronon: to remove support for them would violate the rules of the Shell Command Language, so it would be a non-starter for bash.
[03:23:02] <wiscii> chronon: try shellcheck
[03:23:04] <chronon> But an option o disable might be good?
[03:23:07] <tirnanog> and yes, there are probably tons of scripts out there using them, even if they shouldn't.
[03:23:25] <tirnanog> chronon: maybe. I think, now that we have shellcheck.net, the need for such things is less clear.
[03:23:45] <chronon> Fair enough.
[03:24:11] <Earnestly> What was the result of the problem with 'COLUMNS' being unset until a non-builtin command was issued?

[03:24:45] <greybot> COLUMNS and LINES are set to reflect the terminal's size, but bash does not set these values by default; furthermore it does not export them. If you really need them to be correct and up-to-date, use shopt -s checkwinsize and export COLUMNS and/or LINES. See also http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/091

[03:35:20] <chronon> There might be an ANSI trick for that.
[03:36:33] <wiscii> could you move the cursotr to like 24x40 ?
[03:37:07] <wiscii> OnlineCop: one for you https://m.xkcd.com/386/
[03:37:45] <Earnestly> chronon: No there isn't, all of the escape sequences require dimentions even though it has relative and absolute positioning parameters

[03:38:52] <Earnestly> You can move to origin though, which doesn't help much here.  You can also erase lines, or even the entire display, but it doesn't update cursor position

[14:01:05] <Soliton> probably no need for that variable either way.
[14:01:52] <senoraraton> Well I have 4 ls commands, and they all share those flags.
[14:02:11] <senoraraton> So it seems cleaner to include "global" flags at a variable, and shorten the actual aliases to the relevant information.
[14:03:00] <Soliton> an alias ll='ls -l' will also use the ls alias.

[14:03:17] <senoraraton> Wait....

[14:04:56] <Soliton> as much as alias can be called clean, yes.
[14:05:01] <Soliton> !aliases
[14:05:01] <greybot> Aliases suck. They don't work in scripts. They can't take arguments. They have special evil magical powers that break all expectations. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/080 for starters.
[14:05:41] <senoraraton> Aliases are like the greatest thing in the world...

[14:41:18] <dirtwash> Yesterday I asked about storing the output of a command in a variable, so im storeing a ssl cert in fullcert=$(openssl ...) and it works, now it stops working if I do $(timeout 3 openssl...), it works only if I run it manually like that in the terminal though. Why could that be?

[14:58:22] <osse> "reflow" the script logic a little bit so that the cases would be caught ?

[19:21:24] <emanuele6> it does not make sense to use a delimiter longer than 1 character.

[19:24:38] <dob1> sorry for the OT but just to know, the .env files that use docker and other programs are not related to environment variables, they are in the for foo=bar not export foo=bar
[19:24:42] *** Joins: tobybl (~tobybl@214.242.200.146.dyn.plus.net)
[19:25:23] <emanuele6> the suggestion was to use:   while IFS=$' \t\r\v\f' read -r -a words; do for word in "${words[@]}"; do something "$word"; done; done
[19:25:53] <Soliton> dob1: are you asking us how docker works?
[19:26:20] <emanuele6> or you could just use   tr '[:space:]' '[\n*]' | while IFS= read -r word; do something "$word"; done as geirha suggested, which would respect your system's locale instead of hardcoding the POSIX [:space:] characters
[19:27:07] <emanuele6> ( i meant   tr -s '[:space:]' '[\n*]' )
[19:27:23] *** Joins: Masterphi (~Masterphi@user/masterphi)
[19:28:46] <emanuele6> also   tr -s '[:space:]' '[\n*]'   ignores blank lines, read -ra would not.
[19:29:01] <dob1> Soliton, no about docker about env files, but I suppse they are OT
[19:31:11] <Soliton> if a shell reads them we know how they work otherwise no clue.
[19:31:32] <Soliton> given that they're called env files i would expect they have something to do with the environment.

[19:32:15] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[19:32:36] <Soliton> first google result suggests they are very much docker and that they indeed define env variables.
[19:33:20] <dob1> they are in the for  foo=bar  not export foo=bar  this is what I don't get
[19:33:29] <dob1> *form
[19:33:33] <obiwahn> https://0x0.st/oXli.sh | yeahy this works. Even though it bugs me that I do not understand why IFS and -d fail.
[19:33:49] <Soliton> why do you think a shell is involved?
[19:34:22] <dob1> me?
[19:34:23] <emanuele6> obiwahn: because the way in which you are using -d and IFS is nonsense
[19:34:29] <Soliton> there is some program that reads a file with env variable definitions. what is the relation to a shell?
[19:34:37] <emanuele6> -d 'abcdef'   is the same as  -d 'a'
[19:34:55] <emanuele6> and  IFS=abcdef  is irrelevant if you only read one word
[19:35:35] <obiwahn> So IFS=' ' should do?!
[19:35:57] <emanuele6> i don't understand what makes you think that.
[19:36:00] <emanuele6> care to explain?
[19:36:54] <Soliton> IFS is used for splitting into fields. if you must read exactly one word it does nothing for you.
[19:37:01] <emanuele6> # printf 'axbzcy1z2z3zy' | while IFS=xz read -r -d y -a fields; do declare -p fields; done
[19:37:03] <shbot> emanuele6: declare -a fields=([0]="a" [1]="b" [2]="c")
[19:37:03] <shbot> emanuele6: declare -a fields=([0]="1" [1]="2" [2]="3")
[19:37:08] <emanuele6> this is what IFS and -d do
[19:37:33] <dob1> Soliton, they are called environment variables but they are not, or I don't understand what is an environment variable
[19:37:36] <obiwahn> ah ok
[19:37:42] <emanuele6> IFS decides how the fields are split ( in this case either on "x" or "z"

[19:38:01] <emanuele6> -d ysomething is nonsensical and just equivalent -d y
[19:38:13] <obiwahn> i got it because i can only have one -d
[19:38:21] <emanuele6> and -d decides what is the record separator.
[19:38:36] <dob1> anyway sorry, it's OT, I read a bit about them
[19:38:38] <obiwahn> and i really would want ' \n' but i can not have both
[19:38:49] <emanuele6> what??
[19:38:58] <emanuele6> then why did you say you wanted "vertical tab"
[19:39:11] <emanuele6> or at least confirmed that you also want that.
[19:39:12] <Soliton> dob1: perhaps you think environment variables are related to shells? they're not, every process has an environment and can use environment variables.
[19:39:35] <obiwahn> When I split on space then i have to live with the newline. Or i use 2 reads one that splits on n and then another that splits the line on space.
[19:40:04] <Soliton> perhaps use a yaml parser instead.
[19:40:05] <emanuele6> i still don't get why you  said  <obiwahn > So IFS=' ' should do?!
[19:40:10] <emanuele6> how can you even think that
[19:40:21] <obiwahn> not it can not work

[19:40:34] <emanuele6> yeah, but like, what was the logic?
[19:40:38] <dob1> Soliton, an environment variable is something you can pass between process ?  if you source a file with  foo=bar   you can read "$foo" on a new process if I am not wrong,  but you can if you export foo="bar"
[19:40:52] <dob1> *you can't read "$foo"

[19:41:50] <Soliton> dob1: sourcing a file is what a shell does. it has nothing to do with env variables. the environment is passed from parent process to child processes.
[19:42:13] <obiwahn> I can not even explain. Why I was thinking that modifying the IFS would change when a new line is read.

[22:00:51] <emanuele6> that is what you said before

[22:04:15] <texasmynsted> I have 29 variables I wish to define in an .env file for docker. Most have fixed values. Four of them have values that get defined at run-time.
[22:04:30] <Helmholtz> emanuele6, thanks
[22:05:10] <han-solo> lotharn: not exactly a bash question, but use the inspect window and check what request goes through when you submit a search and use those params for the curl request
[22:05:31] <emanuele6> han-solo: people in #curl are capable of helping him
[22:05:38] <emanuele6> while staying on topic
[22:05:42] <texasmynsted> Once the .env file is built it rarely needs to be re-built
[22:05:45] <han-solo> alright
[22:05:57] <emanuele6> texasmynsted: defined at runtime how?
[22:06:21] <emanuele6> well, you could do something like this
[22:06:25] <texasmynsted> execute a bash function explicitly designed to create the .env file.
[22:06:34] <lotharn> han-solo: thanks for the pointer
[22:06:48] <texasmynsted> mycommand buildenvfile
[22:07:23] <texasmynsted> Then I can mycommand fireupdocker
[22:07:50] <texasmynsted> and later I can just mycommand fireupdocker, without first having to mycommand buildenvfile
[22:07:51] <emanuele6> no, actually using an associative array is dumb
