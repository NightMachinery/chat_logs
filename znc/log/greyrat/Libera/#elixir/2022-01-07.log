[09:39:15] <whk> Nicd: okay. yes, hyperthreading just clicked for me. thanks. :)
[09:39:52] <Nicd> of course it's not really 2 threads per core, but sort of
[09:40:03] <Nicd> they're usually counted as separate logical cores
[09:40:17] <Nicd> so would get separate schedulers by default
[09:41:39] <whk> would it be better to tell erlang to just use 1 scheduler then, or does it not matter. 
[09:44:34] <Nicd> I wouldn't think it is, since then you'd do nothing on the HT. but in the end it's always down to measurements
[09:44:45] <Nicd> I wager you'd lose performance if you only had one scheduler instead of 2
[09:51:41] <whk> with rails we gained more by adding more service task than adding more cpu units... which makes sense, just need to adjust my thinking.  
[09:52:32] <Nicd> service task = process that handles requests?
