[00:02:38] <Kabouik_> ardon I compiled Nyxt from the sources, I haven't tried the .deb or Guix packages actually
[00:02:50] <Kabouik_> Or I did try the Guix package but that was not on Mobian.
[00:03:36] <Kabouik_> Actually in my case it's Droidian because the kernel is not fully upstreamed yet on my phone (under progress) so for now I'm stuck with an Android kernel.
[00:09:33] <Kabouik_> @Nyxt devs, I reported somewhere late November or early December that touch input was no longer working for me (touch scrolling no longer works, and tapping on hyperlinks will just highlight them, but not convey the click action). I didn't know if that was a change in Nyxt or in libwebkit-gtk because I upgraded both at the same time. However now I also recompiled Vieb (vim-based webkit browser) and installed Epiphany, and I
[00:09:33] <Kabouik_> have no such issue with them. I tried to build an older Nyxt commit from Nov/Dec to firmly confirm that it comes from a Nyxt change, but unfortunately none of the commits this age build successfully.
[00:09:59] <Kabouik_> Maybe they are not compatible with latest webkit versions?
[00:10:46] *** Kabouik_ is now known as Kabouik
[00:15:09] <Kabouik> The good thing is it made me fluent with keyboard navigation but that's too limiting on some websites. :<
[00:21:32] <Kabouik> For example, on the GH Readme, follow-hint will not give any hint for any of the hyperlinks in the "Install Nyxt" section.

[02:11:29] <ardon> Honestly I'm just trying to avoid building software from source on my phone, as up until now most derivations I've had to build locally in Guix drain out my phone's battery in a breeze.
[02:28:47] <Kabouik> That should be faster than a build in Guix though, but yeah I understand. On mine the `make all` takes a couple minutes approximately.
[02:29:40] <Kabouik> In any case if you change your mind, please ping me here so we can check if you experience the touch input issue too.

[22:44:58] <Kabouik> Glad to hear that ardon. Actually I haven't opened an issue yet because I was not sure if it was a local problem or not until yesterday. #1170 is really minor compared to what I experience now.
[22:45:10] <Kabouik> Can you scroll with touch, and click on links?
[22:45:23] <Kabouik> With touch input that is
[22:45:57] <ardon> Yeah, I can do both with no problems whatsoever.
[22:46:57] <ardon> Long-pressing brings the context selection menu, much like Firefox.
[22:47:59] <Kabouik> Hum. Can you show a pastebin of `nyxt --system-information`?
[22:48:31] <Kabouik> That means my issue might be local in the end, but really no idea what it can be since it's not my config and libwebkit-gtk is updated

[22:57:25] <Kabouik> Thanks, same webkit version then, I'm confused
[22:57:49] <Kabouik> I wonder why yours shows a Guix version if it was compiled from sources
[22:58:10] <Kabouik> Mine just shows blank there
[22:59:22] <ardon> Do you have Guix installed in that device?
[23:00:10] <ardon> What DE are you running?
[23:00:48] <Kabouik> I have installed it yesterday yeah (until now I was avoiding as I have limited space and Guix is hungry, plus I prefer the idea of the whole Guix system)
[23:00:52] <Kabouik> I'm running i3wm
[23:06:30] <ardon> Yeah, I also would love Guix on mobile, unfortunately it'd involve a lot of work to port a substantial part of postmarketOS pmaports packages. For now I'm just running it in userspace, but even so building packages is a PITA due to often lacking substitutes for aarch64

[23:14:46] <aartaka> ardon: can you switch to VI bindings and try touch scrolling etc. there? I remember Kabouik mentioning something about VI mode...
[23:20:44] <ardon> aartaka: Spot on, activating vi-insert-mode seems to be the culprit.

[23:21:13] <aartaka> ardon: thank you for confirming it!

[23:23:25] <ardon> I'm up to it 🙂
[23:25:46] <aartaka> ardon: I need you to remove the binding for "button1" (line 36 of nyxt/source/mode/vi.lisp) and recompile. If removing it changes the thing, then we catch too much of touch events :)
[23:26:51] <aartaka> ardon: i.e., remove `"button1" 'vi-button1` from the file.
[23:28:46] <ardon> aartaka: It solved the issue!
[23:29:41] <aartaka> ardon: Alright, then we definitely need a way to catch less events :)
