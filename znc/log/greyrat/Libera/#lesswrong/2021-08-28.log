[00:16:47] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Note that the FPA contains no statutory limits on how much money a former president can charge the government annually for office space (former presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama are each charging the government more than $500,000 per year for this emolument), nor on the identity of the landlord that will be paid for providing this service.

[00:16:48] <feepbot> the six decades since the enactment of the law have been purely customary.

[03:12:33] <kiboneu> it's basically adderall after about an hour if you have a high tolerance
[03:12:45] <kiboneu> it's like lubricant for the mind, to me
[03:14:22] <kiboneu> but it's not too demotivating at peak thc, rather you just have to find other modes of work that are more flow-based / creative and then, once the autistic part of the brain sets back in from coming out of your weed high, you have a repository of stuff to try out and implement
[03:14:44] <RiversHaveWings> doesn't it wreck your memory

[03:22:19] <kiboneu> pompolic: a friend of mine visited me last night and he said he was surprised i wasn't prescribed add drugs, or haven't pursued it off-market. but the black market prices are utterly unjustifiable
[03:22:38] <kiboneu> now that i have health insurance i could rethink that, but idk, maybe if the weed thing stops working

[05:09:57] <feepbot> pay them up to 25% more and make a profit. if cutting 25% is 'fair', then that implies either remote workers across the board are a quarter less valuable (despite measured productivity in general remaining the same...) or hiring is uncompetitive & monopsonistic in which case there should be antitrust and regulation to break up these monopsonistic giants and restore competition.

[05:09:57] <feepbot> Google Plans To Cut Remote Workers‚Äô Salaries By 25%. Here‚Äôs The Impact (The common misconception is that remote workers aren‚Äôt as committed to their jobs and the company as someone who works in-office.)
[05:11:16] <kuudes> what is their reasoning?
[05:11:31] <kuudes> surely those home workers save on office rent etc expenses
[05:12:04] <gwern> that would feed into their marginal product, yes
[05:12:30] <gwern> (to the extent that working from home costs the company less than working at a office, it would increase their marginal product)
[05:13:06] <ivan> they get paid not to take the {facebook, microsoft, amazon} job. after they are employed for a bit, they don't want to suffer leetcode hards to switch jobs and can thus be paid less
[05:13:24] <gwern> that would be the monopsony fork, yes
[05:15:39] <nshepperd> '"Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from," a Google spokesperson told Reuters.' sounds like they're assuming they are a monopsony and nobody else is hiring remote
[05:16:48] <adiabatic> apple isn't, not if they can help it
[05:17:21] <ivan> don't believe what they say, they know what they're doing when there are billions of wage dollars on the line
[05:17:29] <gwern> I bet their excuse is that 'remote is less productive', but I'm mostly annoyed that no one is even thinking hard enough to make them put it on the record and there's just these naive intuitions about it being 'fair' and 'adjusting for cost of living'

[05:43:34] <gwern> your reaction should be 'nom nom nom' not 'we're cutting everyone's salary 25% to be "fair"'
[05:44:30] <pie_> maybe they want to limit inflation? (not sure if thats a good term here)
[05:44:50] <pie_> if someone got hired in california and moves to india, and someone got hired in india for a lot cheaper

[05:45:25] <pie_> other than that one of them is paid a lot more
[05:45:27] <gwern> that would be somethin a monopsony could and would do, yes. a one-company cartel holding down wages
[05:45:47] <pie_> ok sorry im dumb (about economics at least. which is frustrating.)
[05:46:02] <gwern> like, say, a bunch of tech companies conspring to not *competitively hire* away from each other... not that that would ever happen
[05:46:15] <gwern> (at least, certainly not written down in emails these days)
[05:47:11] <pie_> but even if there are other players on the market, wouldnt they still want to hire at the lower price regardless of conspiracy? - i dont feel like im phrasing this right
[05:47:33] <pie_> the other immediate conclusion is to move to cali, get hired, move back home
[05:47:47] <pie_> the other immediate conclusion is to move to cali, get hired, move back home
[05:48:47] <gwern> pie_: they have to offer more than the low price in order to get you to move
[05:50:11] <gwern> if google suppresses wages on its own to $100k in a competitive market while workers produce $200k in sweet sweet money, competitors will offer $101k and pick off everyone on the market who will move for $1k; then they'll offer $102k, and so on. and then google will suddenly discover it can't hire literally anyone and will have to offer $150k or however far the process has ratcheted up to
[05:50:37] <gwern> and it'll find that it starts losing employees too who decide that another $50k a year is in fact worth the trouble of leaving
[05:50:43] <ivan> I think it's more like the wages are being suppressed from 500k to 375k or something
[05:51:09] <pie_> aha
[05:51:09] <gwern> yeah, I'm just using round numbers, FANG salaries are much higher these days. they were long past $100k when Jobs et al began their wagefixing cartel
[05:51:48] <pie_> they still save a lot of money if they push down wages for a bit though?
[05:52:12] <pie_> drop in the bucket? manager bonus for slightly decreased costs? :P
[05:52:20] <pie_> but ok. thanks for explaining
[05:52:21] <pie_> √∫≈±
[05:52:30] <gwern> sure. there are imperfections... but to the extent there are those temporal lags and stickinesses and imperfections, that makes them monopsonistic and is simply a longwinded way of accepting *that* fork

[23:05:58] <quanticle> That's one of the points that Vaughan makes in _Challenger Launch Decision_. The language that the engineers used in the pre-launch teleconference wasn't like, a last ditch cry for attention. It was a *normal* procedural conference, in which engineering issues were raised, risk analysis and mitigation was considered, and decisions were made.
[23:06:33] <gwern> they failed to make a heroic effort if they were seriously concerned, so it just came off as 'this o-ring is known to the State of California to contain carcinogens'?
[23:06:42] <kuudes> ie on those countries deaths are again over 1 per million per day, ~400 per million per year, ie in usa that would be 130k deaths per year
[23:06:53] <kuudes> is this "new normal"?
[23:07:39] <adiabatic> possibly. how many does the flu take here per year
[23:07:42] <mokulus> Is that a well made graph? I find it very noisy.
[23:08:13] <quanticle> Boisjoly raised the issue of the O-rings, not because he was especially concerned about them, but because yes, it was a cold launch and also because he'd raised the issue of the O-rings in pretty much every previous pre-launch conference for the past two or three years. The issue of hot gas impingement on the O-rings was a known issue by this point, and so the management at NASA asked the
[23:08:14] <quanticle> engineers before every launch whether it was fine.
[23:08:35] <quanticle> He was the O-ring guy
[23:08:42] <quanticle> Of course he raised the issue of the O-rings
[23:09:21] <kuudes> https://i.imgur.com/vlgAklJ.png is only fin, uk, isr
[23:10:42] <kuudes> adiabatic, I don't know. over here it is at most 180 per million per year
[23:11:02] <kuudes> direct influenza deaths are something like 1 per million per year, the rest are indirect deaths
[23:11:19] <kuudes> ie "died with flu"
[23:11:25] <mokulus> If you google "covid deaths germany graph" I think it's much more readable
[23:11:39] <kuudes> mokulus, you can do your own charts on owid if you want
[23:12:26] <kuudes> adiabatic, so at least twice the influenza deaths, maybe more
[23:13:11] <adiabatic> "2x flu deaths" sounds totally normalizable
[23:13:12] <kuudes> ie when it has hit 1 per million per day they have put restriction measures, ie ~"lockdown"
[23:13:30] <kuudes> 10x traffic deaths then?

[23:38:11] <gwern> is that really necessary? busy intersections/locations are already 'flash mobs' on a daily basis, as it were
[23:38:26] <quanticle> True, but those flash mobs are random
[23:38:31] <quanticle> What if you want to be more selective

Thank you, anon! | This initial capital means we'll be able to: | - apply for 501(c)(3) tax exemption status (which costs either $250 or $600) | - set up a public 64TB dataset server (~$90/mo) | - pay for Notion ($5/user/mo)‚Äô

[23:55:41] <quanticle> >pay for Notion 
[23:56:26] <dbohdan> shawwwn: Congratulations
[23:56:57] <shawwwn> it's actually $10/user/mo, but supposedly 501(c)(3) cuts that in half. It's pending verification though
[23:57:21] <nshepperd> can't just have notions without paying for them
[23:57:27] <shawwwn> we're up to 6 notion users already, so it was starting to become a bit of a worry
[23:57:43] <quanticle> You're going to be waiting a *while* for that verification, btw
[23:57:47] <quanticle> My mom just got hers
[23:57:51] <gwern> cunning of them
[23:57:52] <quanticle> She applied in March
[23:58:39] <PapuaHardyNet> which verification are we talking about here?
[23:58:52] <quanticle> 501c(3) tax exemption
[23:59:03] <PapuaHardyNet> ouch, that's a surprisingly long time
[23:59:43] <PapuaHardyNet> well, we can run with Notion's free trial until we hit its limits. Then we pivot if necessary
[23:59:51] <quanticle> Not that surprisingly. The IRS was shut down for a good chunk of 2019 because of Congressional shennanigans, and then COVID disrupted things further.
