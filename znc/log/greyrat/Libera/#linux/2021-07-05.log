[03:11:19] <PaulFertser> NemesisD: the fonts should be scaled according to DPI automatically. Or do you mean not text by "everything"?
[03:11:25] <Dagmar> Then don't try to "trick" it.

[03:12:01] <curdlesnoot> or, at best, run a resolution that can be upscaled by a perfect integer multiple (which is not what's going on in this instance).
[03:12:03] <swl> PaulFertser: Thanks for your help

[06:28:05] <PonyBlocks> yes
[06:28:09] <PonyBlocks> i have 2 ports
[06:28:11] <PonyBlocks> on computer

[06:28:45] <JohnDoe2> that
[06:28:49] <PonyBlocks> so yes i have 2 monitors and both are connected to computer.
[06:29:15] <JohnDoe2> that doesn't clear it up for me. So your host computer is using your CPU's embedded GPU now that you gave the nvidia to the windows vm.
[06:29:31] <PonyBlocks> yes.
[06:29:59] <JohnDoe2> video output should go do that nvidia for the windows vm so one of your monitors needs to be connected to the nvidia, and the other to your host (motherboard video port)

[20:42:01] <pinemach> I'm new to KDE. I've been having weird behavior with my laptop's external display. One thing that is a bit of an annoyance is that after I turn my monitor off and then on again, or after disconnecting and reconnecting, the window positions are almost all reset to the laptop's display instead of the external display. (Apparently all maximized
[20:42:01] <pinemach> windows are reset, and windows not at full size are not reset.) Even if I haven't interacted with the system at all, just cycled the power on the display. I don't know if the taskbar slowly flickering on and off on the laptop display when the external display is connected is related - it seems to take a moment for the desktop to decide where the
[20:42:01] <pinemach> taskbar belongs, and the maximized windows are all being resized as the taskbar appears and disappears. What can I do to stop having all my windows always sent to the laptop display even when I just want to turn the external display off?

[21:05:46] <pinemach> Well, I sort of solved my problem with the interestingly named "Protect Porn Privacy" KWin script which moves all windows to the primary screen when a new display is found. Remembering which display each window was on would be ideal, but better to move them all to the big external display in the center of my desk than move them all back to the
[21:05:46] <pinemach> smaller laptop screen, I guess

[22:20:22] <curdlesnoot> it responds to the WINEPREFIX environment variable, as noted by the man page. if you end up with drive_c/windows/syswow64, it's "win64" but that can be changed by WINEARCH.
[22:20:41] <curdlesnoot> what you can't do, however, is repurpose an existing prefix from one arch to another.

[22:22:27] <phoenixes> if wine does what windows does
[22:22:40] <phoenixes> then you should be able to
[22:22:59] <ayao> so there is no need to create more prefixes, in my prefix i saw program files folder and program files (x86) folder
[22:23:02] <curdlesnoot> you can generally run 32-bit programs in a 64-bit prefix (that's what the WoW layer was for in Windows). you can't take an _existing_ prefix and switch it between win32 and win64. if in doubt, the (probable) default of win64 is probably OK.
