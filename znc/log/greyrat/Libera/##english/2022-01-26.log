[07:01:08] <bullgard4> Hm. Wiktionary seems to know only a transitive use of the verb »persist«. But https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction: "A transaction rollback operation does not persist the partial results of data manipulations within the scope of the transaction to the database." What does 'persist' mean here?

When an action is offered, for example: "Susie offers some pets to her cat" ,  is this a valid usage? In this case, does it mean that the action is done even without "concent", or does "to offer" only ever imply that Susie would stop at asking/motioning, but not actually provide the pets without "approval"?

[21:39:14] <looney> I'm starting to think that maybe Merriam Webster isn't a great dictionary after all. It's confusing, overly complex, probably even imprecise. I checked out Dictionary.com and it looks much better, simple but complete
[21:40:04] <looney> for example, blkshp mentioned the word "florid". Check out how confusing it looks on MW: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/florid
[21:40:32] <looney> there's no mention that "elaborately decorated" is excessive or disapproving, for example
[21:41:03] <looney> Longman and Oxford (for learners) give that info though (usually disapproving, unnecessary details, etc.).
[21:41:40] <blkshp> !d florid
[21:41:42] <tinsoldier> florid — Adjective: 1. Having a rosy or pale red colour; ruddy., 2. Elaborately ornate; flowery., 3. (of a disorder, especially mental) In a blatant, vivid, or highly disorganized state., 4. (obsolete) Flourishing; in the bloom of health. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/florid
[21:41:47] <looney> Dictionary.com also says "excessive" and "showy": https://www.dictionary.com/browse/florid
[21:41:55] <blkshp> !more
[21:41:55] <tinsoldier> There is no more.
[21:42:54] <looney> it would be interesting to hear what blkshp actually meant, and which dictionary has the best definition for that
[21:43:42] <blkshp> Overly detailed oversharing.
[21:44:24] <LuisR14> i guess it wouldn't give the nuances in the definition, but i see it mentioned in the "did you know?" section

[23:56:07] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v GuiToris
[23:56:10] <huf> so try that
[23:56:25] <blkshp> GuiToris: now, if the channel were +m you and only you could speak.
[23:56:44] <TimMc> huf: much easier, thank you
[23:56:58] <fkcen> i made a surprising discovery: in europe(italy) we got censorship like in china
[23:56:59] <GuiToris> blkshp, how beautiful it would be!
[23:57:01] <huf> GuiToris: and we can all see your promiscuous +v winking at us
[23:57:18] <blkshp> But other than that or occasionally used as a badge for symbolising things (like who is the channel ops without being opped)
[23:57:35] <blkshp> fkcen: I* Europe* Italy* China.* :D
[23:57:43] <fkcen> i was trying to view uk betting sites (just view) for the odds of the next italian president, but all are blocked!
[23:57:49] <blkshp> And yes, I do find it a little odd that this is something that exists
[23:57:58] <blkshp> (Please try to capitalise proper nouns)
[23:58:51] <fkcen> we are not allowed to see the websites, how crazy is that
[23:58:51] <GuiToris> ahh, don't be hard on him, they were all improper
[23:59:16] <blkshp> fkcen: It is somewhat different than I would have imagined for Italy!
[23:59:20] <GuiToris> fkcen, Tor Browser Bundle
[23:59:30] <fkcen> again blkshp is very kind in private
[23:59:41] <blkshp> Why do you keep saying that?
[23:59:42] <GuiToris> fkcen, lies
[23:59:44] <fkcen> (i have prrof)
[23:59:49] <fkcen> proof
