[00:00:35] <kveroneau> Good question.  Let me look that up.
[00:00:47] <vdamewood> hxx: Just make sure to use PySide instead of PyQt.
[00:00:56] <hxx> What difference does it make?
[00:01:03] <vdamewood> PyQt is GPL, not LGPL.
[00:01:16] <nomagno> kveroneau: My VM is also made specifically for a game, the difference is I'm not sure how it fits in a racing game outside an Easter egg and/or possibly some very advanced mechanic
[00:01:22] <vdamewood> Well, also, PySide is developed by The Qt Company.
[00:01:30] <nomagno> Perhaps I could use it for automation of car driving in a special mode? :O

[00:04:55] <hxx> I don't actually own a mac, so cocoa touch would be useless for me. I like objective-c because it's a very strict superset of C, more than C++.
[00:05:09] <kveroneau> vdamewood, I cannot find anything specific, but I don't see how a application couldn't be designed in Lazarus to be HIG-complient.  It has all the same widgets available in all popular widgetsets across all platforms and APIs.
[00:05:33] *** Quits: rany (~rany@user/rany) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[00:05:39] <vdamewood> kveroneau: Because the different HIGs for various desktops contradict each other in places.
[00:06:01] <kveroneau> Oh, well on macOS, the titlebar works as you'd expect it to work on macOS.
[00:06:31] <deniska> vdamewood: there's only so far you can go without designing different GUIs for each OS
[00:06:40] <vdamewood> kveroneau: For example, on mac, the Okay/Cancel pair place the Okay button on the far right, the Cancel button just to the left of the Okay button, and the 'Fuck it, I don't care' button to the far left.
[00:06:43] <nomagno> hxx: Objective-C is tad bit too heavy, requires either GNU runtime or Apple runtime
[00:06:45] <nomagno> Not specified either
[00:06:51] <kveroneau> So, if you took the same Lazarus code with a menubar on the Linux desktop, where it's where you'd expect, and then compile on macOS against Cocoa, the menubar will be at the top of the screen where a macOS user would expect it.
[00:07:01] <vdamewood> kveroneau: On windows, they are all centered, and the okay button is on the left.

[02:06:43] <pyzozord> and just ate way too much food, so i'm not able to do anything other than chat on irc and watch stupid videos on youtube

[02:08:39] <vms14> in Spain we have a nice tradition, we torture bulls until death and honor the assassin

[02:28:39] <vms14> hmm
[02:28:49] <pyzozord> in communities like this irc people often have more developed ideas and consider clean code primitve or even simply wrong
[02:29:15] <decker> haha sometimes 
[02:29:18] <pyzozord> but in office work environment people usually have much less developed ideas, and often consider clean code the gold standard

[02:29:51] <vms14> I mean about taking words from others, specially irc xd
[02:30:50] <flakland> i think if the code is modular then you should be able to  safely clea n up the parts that bother you, or whoever you are afraid of, khan?

[03:17:17] <[itchyjunk]> so the object still has leg but you just can access the leg methods

[03:21:05] <PlanckWalk> Yes, whether the internals are exposed, whether the methods are implemented as functions or function pointers or whatever isn't so important.
[03:21:12] <[itchyjunk]> does C have objects i nthat way?
[03:21:23] <vms14> just helps you to represent something, but it could do much more
[03:21:35] <decker> anonymous strcutres can give you inhertiance
[03:21:35] <PlanckWalk> C doesn't have objects except by convention
[03:21:46] <vms14> and btw I'll tell you a thing that I've read some time ago in some random programming book
[03:21:52] <decker> but you apply attributes with has-a instead of is-a ... like a cat has-a animal representation
[03:22:02] <decker> rather than cat is-a animal
[03:22:03] <vms14> Data representation is more important than algorithms
[03:22:04] <[itchyjunk]> i mean can you create a data type and set of methods that interact with it?
[03:22:09] <macaw> [itchyjunk]: "when one says X the other seems to pick from some list relating to X" => Look into behaviour trees (gamedev, although I do not know much about this field); or more generally (CS), Theory of Computation - grammars - for this example, non-deterministic FSMs are what you're looking for.

[03:22:21] <PlanckWalk> [itchyjunk]: You can do that even in Turing machines.
[03:22:23] <vms14> and it happens that the algorithm depends on how you represent the data
[03:22:32] <PlanckWalk> The question is how much support the language gives you for it.
[03:22:34] <[itchyjunk]> interesting
[03:22:37] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the language C does not have a notion of classes or objects (at least not in the OOP sense).  But it's of course a general-purpose programming language and you can build those abstractions yourself
[03:22:38] <PlanckWalk> And C gives you very little.

[03:23:45] <PlanckWalk> Some libraries develop their own object-like structures and conventions, but they usually aren't compatible with the structures and conventions from other libraries.
[03:24:06] <PlanckWalk> So you have to write a lot more interface code to translate.
[03:24:08] <[itchyjunk]> macaw, ive not come across graphs yet

[03:26:17] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well we're even using the word "points" here!  so yes it has pointers in that sense

[03:27:00] <kennyd> most civilized languages don't
[03:27:02] <decker> almost think the problem in C is non-pointer types.  When you go to python or JS you have no issues with everything is a pointer... 
[03:27:06] <karstensrage> java is a c based language but the designers specifically took out memory management and pointers to make it easier on programmers
[03:27:07] <PlanckWalk> Yes, instead *every* non-primitive variable is really a "pointer"
[03:27:14] <[itchyjunk]> yeah, C had something like var = blah then var* was a pointer to var or somesuch

[03:44:55] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I think they're trolling you :P
[03:44:59] <decker> it's just windows is such a huge attack surface
[03:45:02] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[03:45:38] <apotheon> Linux has been trying really hard to catch up with Windows for the virus support feature, but traditionally in the Unixy world there's far less opportunity for a virus to execute, because it far more often requires user intervention.
[03:45:41] <[itchyjunk]> virus are kind of a bot too? i guess we'ed have to define one if we ever wanna talk about it
[03:45:44] <flakland> and sometimes when they fix the vulnerability it opens up a new one!
[03:45:45] <KillerWasp> There are no viruses in Linux because there are only good guys there.
[03:45:56] <apotheon> Linux the ecosystem, not the kernel (as far as I know).
[03:46:09] <decker> right noone's gotten caught putting exploitive code in the kernel

[03:46:41] <apotheon> A virus is not something in the kernel.
[03:46:43] <kennyd> there are no viruses in linux for the same reason there are no games, photoshop, premiere. linux is a red headed step child when it comes to non-server software, and people don't tend to spend time to port their programs for the tiny minority of the users who would use it 
[03:46:53] <apotheon> That would be a malicious vulnerability.

[03:48:21] <CaCode> some sort of genius who basically invented malware
[03:48:26] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: No, a virus is a type of malware.
[03:48:35] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: A worm is a different type of malware.
[03:48:36] <KillerWasp> It is only surpassed by the number of mobiles.
[03:48:37] <kennyd> what's the percentage of desktop users using linux?
[03:48:45] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: . . . and adware is another different type of malware.
[03:48:51] <decker> trojan
[03:48:51] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: wikipedia defines it as a computer program that replicates itself.  Which seems like a reasonable definition
[03:48:52] <PlanckWalk> The main feature of a virus is that it replicates, usually with some user action.
[03:48:54] <[itchyjunk]> okay so not all malware are virus
[03:48:56] <KillerWasp> But really windows and macintosh is already obsolete.
[03:49:02] <[itchyjunk]> ah self replication, cool
[03:49:08] <PlanckWalk> Those that replicate entirely by themselves are usually called worms
[03:49:17] <[itchyjunk]> oh..
[03:49:20] <kennyd> let me know when I can use photoshop instead of gimp on linux and I might be interested
[03:49:25] <[itchyjunk]> i thought worms = gives you backdoor
[03:49:32] <decker> but a virus also often has a payload that is triggered later
[03:49:39] <apotheon> PlanckWalk: On Windows, it rarely requires user action.
[03:49:42] <KillerWasp> [itchyjunk]: no, a trojan have backdoor
[03:49:50] <[itchyjunk]> oh right, trojan is backdoor
[03:49:51] <KillerWasp> worm only eat the memory and disk
[03:49:51] <[itchyjunk]> nm
[03:49:57] <decker> worm is self propagating across systems

[03:51:57] <apotheon> decker: On a system where software isn't allowed to just run at various times because the OS thinks it's a great idea to execute shit willy-nilly, user intervention may be required to execute the relevant software that causes the virus to replicate.

[04:08:33] <isekaijin> kennyd: The main (only?) reason why regular desktop Linux is not a commercially attractive platform for consumer software is that it gives users too much freedom.

[04:13:15] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: it means that worms don't need another program to help them, they can do it themselves
[04:13:32] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: so 1 worm makes 2 copies, and each copy can make 2 copies and then each can make 2 more copies...
[04:13:40] <[itchyjunk]> say i have file.blah and i run file.blah. how does it copy itself?

[04:19:14] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: this is the classic computer "worm".  Some "classic" worms spread because people run files in emails then the file copies itself and opens your email client and sends more copies of the emails out

[05:38:51] <InPhase> flakland: I've written firmware for hardware I've designed, for which the rational place to put the binary blob was in the driver I wrote.  But ultimately this is identical to sitting there and laying out an ASIC circuit to do the same sorts of things that the firmware blob does.  Moving it into a blob, or having no blob, is essentially no different in terms of the freedom to act that a piece of 
[05:38:57] <InPhase> hardware has.  It is just easier to fix problems when you have more of that behavior in a loadable piece of firmware, which is why this is done.  Hardware development time is shorter, and the ability to fix errors after the sale / deployment becomes possible.

[05:39:04] <InPhase> Sorry, that should have been addressed to Guest80.
[05:39:45] <InPhase> Guest80: Fundamentally, the right perspective is that none of your hardware is "open source" whether there is a firmware blob or not.
[05:40:34] <norias> InPhase: i know it wasn't directed at me - but i'm appreciative of the insight
[05:40:40] <InPhase> Guest80: You can even use generic FPGA or very simple microcontroller devices with open source firmware, and it's still not open source because you can't actually see what is happening inside the chips.
[05:41:20] <InPhase> It is important to assess this properly in risk models, because manufacturing chains for hardware matter a great deal in establishing a trustworthy system.

[07:12:25] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmm
[07:12:33] <[itchyjunk]> coq huh..
[07:12:47] <[itchyjunk]> i thought learning data strucutres first would help learn coq
[07:13:03] <[itchyjunk]> but seems like knowing coq might help with learning data structures..

[07:14:55] <[itchyjunk]> haskell is kinda dependently typed right?
[07:15:02] <[itchyjunk]> so maybe haskell is a good one?
[07:15:59] *** Joins: YHVH (~yhvh@2601:982:8300:8090:e035:c7e:ce95:b49b)
[07:16:01] <beaky> yes once you become familiar with specifying data and constraints with formal approaches like coq or alloy and also using those tools to help you prove algorithms correct then it makes things easier since you will be used to the kinds of ways data structures get specified and stuff

[07:17:22] <beaky> not haskell because haskell lacks dependent types unlike coq or agda so you lack the power to specify even simple constraints like "x is equal to y"

[07:18:36] <constxd> best way to study data structures is just the RAM + pseudocode imo

[07:19:47] *** Joins: Guest80 (~Guest80@S01069050ca4e3573.cg.shawcable.net)
[07:23:39] <beaky> but pseudocode is not the way to go because it tries to present itself as a proper formal language but is not actually adequate enough to work with directly unliek actual formal approaches to algorithm and data structure specification and verification where you can for example directly 'code' the  algorithm in an expressive way that's pretty much executable (unlike pseudocode, python as
[07:23:41] <beaky> "executable pseudocode" notwithstanding) and directly apply inductive arguments to that formal version of the algorithm or data structure and get proofs that way
[07:23:50] *** Quits: geenvoud (~geenvoud@user/geenvoud) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:24:59] <beaky> with a formal approach you get to study all the important proofs on the data structure by stepping through the proof and watch it fold and unfold the parts of the algorithm and rewrite terms into the propositions being verified

[11:01:23] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: In practice relational databases still seem to be the ones that have a powerful declarative query language. (A nasty one in many respects, but a one.) "NoSQL" is so broad as to be a useless category, but an awful lot of those systems expect you to operate at a much lower level, and even in the event that some nice declarative query language emerges for them, to be really useful that language would have to impose some of the very structure

[11:06:07] <average> nosql-vs-rdbms is a debate that has been proposed and packages and sold to millions of devs worldwide, and it's totally nonsensical and almost identical to the act of jerking off..
[11:06:12] <average> *packaged
[11:06:26] <pyzozord> besides noSQL vs rdbms for me is an interesting subject because i do t understand the differences but obviously both exist in the world so there is some reason

[11:07:07] <apotheon> If so, you're arguing against straw men.
[11:07:19] <average> pyzozord: you know why you don't understand the differences? it's because you don't know much about the implementation of either ! because that's expensive, to read source code and algorithms of both of them, and understand how they work
[11:07:33] <average> pyzozord: so how can you possibly compare them, if you don't understand either of them at a deep enough level..
[11:08:03] <pyzozord> actually i did read things about how they work internally
[11:08:08] <oldlaptop> apotheon: It's unfortunate that RDBMSes have the worst of both worlds in that SQL has won so comprehensively that it isn't really practical politics to experiment with different language designs, but they still all differ enough that interoperability is painful

[12:06:22] <merijn> It's mostly that I've done a bunch of GPU matrix/image processing stuff and 2D convolutions are, like, the most basic element of any of those. And convolutions are like hammers, when you've got one, every problem looks like a nail ;)
[12:06:41] <merijn> Because the nice thing about 2D convolutions is that they're trivially parallelisable

[14:34:51] <GeDaMo> There are ARM-based asynchronous designs, I don't know if any are in production

[14:35:40] <mrig> What is different about the design for asynchronous? Does this help with timing issues perhaps? 
[14:36:00] <GeDaMo> There's no single clock, each unit waits for data to arrive
[14:36:21] <mrig> Working with the distance scales rather than against them.

[14:38:58] <ProfSimm> It's interesting when you have async technically there's no simple way to transmit 1 and 0. It's just 1, which comes at arbitrary times.
[14:39:14] <ProfSimm> Of course you can still encode info that way.
[14:39:24] <ProfSimm> Say by sending an impulse alongside different paths
[14:39:25] <GeDaMo> it's 1 or 0 with an enable signal :P

[20:54:16] <Pickchea> Hey, I have an array of posterior probabilities and a function computing them. How should I call them to avoid name conflicts? `posteriors = posteriors_fn(...)' or `posteriors_arr = posteriors(...)'? I don't really like function names like `calculate_posteriors' or `get_posteriors' or something. Sounds so procedural, doesn't match the rest of my code.

[20:58:23] <austincheney> Pickchea, my recommendation for identifiers is: 1) uniquness within a limited context of availability, 2) a name that is meaningful yet concise.  Don't over think naming, as code identifiers can be arbitrarily changed later.  Data identifiers require more refactoring to change

[21:01:45] <oldlaptop> if the reason it's not is that the language would make that inconvenient, I suppose an ugly name matches that ugly situation. If the reason is that repeated references to the function would be inefficient, I would think something involving "_cache" is a pretty meaningful and concise explanation of why it exists.

[21:35:51] <pyzozord> problem with gold as a store of value that it's essentially useless
[21:35:52] <vdamewood> I googled and did some math, 20kg of gold would be about 1036 cubic centimeters.
[21:36:29] <pikapika> vdamewood, so about 10cm sided cube
[21:36:31] <pyzozord> and people can change mind about it. although it was "the gold standard" of currencies so I guess some people though that it was stable enough

[21:37:36] <pyzozord> yeah but there are cheaper materials that work like that too no? maybe not as well but we'll enough?

[22:59:13] <[-_-]> like the memory and battery loop will get update every 30s

[22:59:46] <[-_-]> then I guess central loop0 will have to update every second also
[23:00:05] <pyzozord> vms14 i don't know how bayaz made it to my message, this autocorrect is weird
[23:00:09] <[-_-]> wait, it may not have to, just cause there is update doesn't mean I have to print it
[23:00:15] <InPhase> [-_-]: Okay.  There are two ways to do this.  One is the simple way that will be appealing to "I am not a CS student" which is to not do it at all the way you're planning, and instead just make a single routine that decides which of these to check at each loop based on how much time has passed since the last time it was checked.
[23:00:15] <GeDaMo> Why doesn't loop1 just read memory and battery and print everything out?
[23:00:39] <vms14> [-_-]: then you want async stuff?
[23:00:45] <[-_-]> o.o
[23:01:01] <[-_-]> GeDaMo: then I don't need loop0
[23:01:10] <GeDaMo> How often do you want to print out?
[23:01:20] <InPhase> [-_-]: The way a software engineer ideally approaches this scenario with true parallelism is to setup a multithreaded system with event loops where some of the event loops are running timers to poll the information, and they send update messages to the display thread.
[23:01:20] <[-_-]> that is also a variable
[23:01:25] <vms14> I've made a package in perl to simplify loops
[23:02:03] <vms14> you just write the whole process in lines and it takes every line and wraps it inside a function that will execute one line every time is called
