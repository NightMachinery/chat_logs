[01:03:06] <Ankhers> OliverMT: Thanks, I'll check that out. Do you use cockroach much? Do you have a way around using citext? I can't seem to figure this one out either.
[01:04:43] <OliverMT> what do you mean round
[01:04:50] <OliverMT> you want citext functionality in cockroachdb?
[01:04:58] <OliverMT> for what, unique index?
[01:05:08] <Ankhers> Mostly, yes.
[01:06:25] <OliverMT> you have to go oldschool
[01:06:33] <OliverMT> google for "case insensitive collation"
[01:07:02] <OliverMT> basically you set a language collation that is case insensitive
[01:07:09] <OliverMT> I think that is what postgres citext does under the hood too

[21:58:06] <Ankhers> josevalim: Sorry for the direct ping. I was just wondering if this is / was a bug. https://paste.sr.ht/~ankhers/4aa54b2a5bc036d708ffcc89fa8b68b65f3ed26f -- We had similar code at work that has been working in 1.12 (and maybe 1.11). But stopped compiling in 1.13. Just wondering if this was intentional or if it is a regression. I realize this code is less than ideal.
[21:59:11] <Ankhers> It specifically had an issue with the arrow and the equals being there.

[22:24:32] <Ankhers> Oh, sorry about that. Thanks, I figured it was intentional.
[22:28:03] <Ankhers> What is the reason it doesn't compile though? Why couldn't the variable be scoped to the other with clauses? You can use equals in a with.
[22:28:57] <Nicd> swap the <- and =
[22:29:27] <Ankhers> I agree. I just don't know why one works and not the other? Because I can write `with foo = bar()`.
[22:30:03] <Ankhers> Unless it is because there is additional handling for = inside a with to support that. In which case I could understand.
[22:40:01] <OliverMT> Ankhers: I dont know if there is coercion to collation in cockroachdb, I'd try to just make the column with collation
[22:40:43] <OliverMT> Ankhers: or even better is probably to make the column with regular collation and then do a collation in the index... does cockroach support create index ... on (lower(email)) ?
[22:40:46] <OliverMT> I'd try that first
[22:45:19] <Ankhers> OliverMT: No, there is no implicit collation with cockroach (at least not the version I am running). I tried creating just the column with the collation and it complains on insert that the thing you are inserting does not match the column type. I'll have to check the index thing. Thanks for the suggestion!

[23:00:02] <ehamberg> is it possible to get postgrex and/or ecto to treat both the atoms `:nil` and `:null` as `null` values? I'm looking at porting a system from Erlang to Elixir piece by piece, and in a transition phase both encodings will exist.
[23:01:21] <Ankhers> ehamberg: As in you want to use `:nil` and `:null` on the Elixir side and use `null` on inside postgres?
[23:01:46] <ehamberg> Ankhers: yes
[23:03:04] <Ankhers> ehamberg: Since you are moving from Erlang to Elixir, presumably you are rewriting some code? So why not just move all the `:null`s to `:nil`? Also you can just use `nil` without the colon, `:nil === nil`.

[23:05:21] <ehamberg> I'm just afraid that there are some cases that tests don't cover that will lead to `:null`s being passed. e.g. from data derived from jsx.

[23:10:03] <Ankhers> Short of wrapping each field in a custom type, you could change the mapping in the changeset function(s) that you have. You would go through the map of params and convert all `:null`s to `nil`s.
[23:10:33] <Ankhers> That would require a custom function to be written, and a single additional line in all changeset functions though.
[23:10:40] <Ankhers> I'm not sure if there is a better solution.

[23:15:30] <tristan> just don't port ;)
[23:15:42] <Ankhers> I mean, Erlang is an awesome language.
[23:17:38] <Ankhers> You could also try and cleanup the database beforehand. And log warning for then you find Erlang `null`s. Then once you are confident you have things "fixed", then start the transition to the new lang?

[23:29:04] <ehamberg> it's more about the other direction: if an erlang module calls Elixir code, that code will expect postgresql `null`s to be encoded as `:null` like e.g. epgsql does.
[23:29:43] <ehamberg> hmmm, handling it in the changeset functions could actually work.
