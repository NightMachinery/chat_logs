[00:05:18] <Guest78> I have a question regarding the generating function of Plane Partitions which are a generalization of integer partitions. The integer partition of the integer 3 is: [1^0 2^0 3^1], [1^1 2^1 3^0], and [1^3 2^0 3^0]. Here I write the type vectors for reading. The number of ways to split a number into k parts is written by the generating function:
[00:05:19] <Guest78> PROD_(i=1)^k 1/(1-x^i).
[00:05:19] <Guest78> A plane partition is this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_partition Why is the generating function of this PROD_(i=1)^k 1/(1-x^i)^i ?
[00:05:28] <Guest78> So why the ^i

[03:40:41] <somiaj> Guest78: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/240243/getting-gif-and-or-moving-images-into-a-latex-presentation -- hmm seems to suggest you can use .png files to create animations in the final .pdf. look at option 3 under the top answer, using \animategraphics[] command
[03:40:53] <Guest78> I haven't heard of Impressive, but I'll take a look.
[03:40:53] <Guest78> My idea was to use screens facing the audience. One has the beamer slides then the other animations which I play as needed
[03:41:15] <Guest78> Yeah I saw that too, but for a Manim animation...I'm not sure that is going to be feasible
[03:41:42] <Guest78> but I haven't tried it yet!  so maybe
[03:42:00] <somiaj> ahh looks like they are using beamer to create the animiation, but then exporting the the presentation to images, and showing the images, one of which has the animation
[03:42:32] <Guest78> I didn't want to spend too much time on this which is why I came up with the two screens thing. Its just so direct

[03:50:12] <Guest78> by G. E. Andrews -- if anyone cares to know.
[03:50:13] <Guest78> The question was a proof for the generating function for a plane partition
[03:57:36] <Guest78> I also found this: https://i.imgur.com/yzxXTNA.png Which is quite..well if I had said that something was "immediate", my professor would smack the back of my head.

So here, you start with cl(A) disconnected, meaning it has a disconnection: two disjoint nonempty open subsets whose union is all of cl(A). From this, find a disconnection of just the set A. Find this last already means that the assumption "A is connected" has been contradicted.

[17:56:28] <mycroftiv> joel135: well pursuing stacks starts with Grothendieck discussing ideas for a homotopic topological algebra based on groupoids and you can see a fair amount of things that actually play out in hott discussed
[17:57:10] <lpapp> it means not using it
[17:57:14] <lpapp> e.g. in arrays, lists, etc.
[17:57:21] <lpapp> I see mathematicians start counting from 1
[17:57:31] <lpapp> which is counter-productive for programming
[17:57:34] <lpapp> and causes a lot of confusion
[17:57:43] <lpapp> by one off errors, etc.
[17:58:01] <diophantoz> yes
[17:58:23] <mycroftiv> theres a large scale generalized motivation in the Grothendieck-Lawvere topoi-foundations program to unify logic and geometry, so hott making homotopic path-connection its fundamental idea of equality connects to that directly
[17:58:23] <lpapp> just spent a couple of hours of bugfixing
[17:58:33] <lpapp> trying to implement a mathematical algorithm specified with starting index = 1
[17:58:40] <lpapp> it is really a bad idea when it has to come to programming.
[17:58:50] <dude12312414> well even in math sometimes counting starts at 0 if convenient. Actually in math, you can count using an arbitrary index set
[17:59:10] <lpapp> yes, so if it is meant to be programmed, just use 0
[17:59:18] <dude12312414> most math is not concerned about programming so they just don't worry about it
[17:59:25] <lpapp> mathematicians need to learn thinking as a programmer when they are writing algos for programming :)
[17:59:39] <diophantoz> lpapp, you've made your point
[17:59:48] <lpapp> I am reading CLRS and their pseudo-code is based on index = 1
[18:00:05] <lpapp> It took me hours to find the one off errors when trying to implement e.g. KMP
[18:00:20] <lpapp> since they are writing pseudo-code (hint: programming), why do they do this, really bad

[18:00:48] <lpapp> Maybe, the reason is that this is how mathematicians write code at large, too, in real life
[18:01:04] <lpapp> they ignore front completely to waste negligible space for convenience :)
[18:01:06] <mycroftiv> lpapp: this is your own fault for not thinking about the indexing properly, and different programming languages use different conventions for this anyway
[18:01:14] <lpapp> ah, no.
[18:01:32] <joel135> mycroftiv: would it be wrong to say that both stacks and hott are actively removing the assumption that the foundational building blocks are discrete, and that this is all there is to it?

[18:03:26] <mycroftiv> joel135: that is part of categorical motivations i agree but the way things play out with the interaction of the constructive heritage of type theory with the homotopic/categorical ideas in HoTT means discrete things are still very foundational there
[18:04:25] <joel135> right, as hlevels
[18:04:54] <mycroftiv> there is a pretty common topos-theoretic view that type theory is the *internal language* which is common to many topoi
[18:06:11] <fxrh> lpapp: well, this all just happened because the C developers were too lazy to add a small abstraction layer for how array elements are accessed, so I'm not sure it's the programmers who should be able to complain here ;) (Also, hi :D)
[18:06:17] <joel135> yes, this is basically the default interpretation of dependent type theory i think, and hott solves some old nagging issues here
[18:07:16] <mycroftiv> well, its the categorical view of dependent type theory, if you take type theory itself as *truly* foundational, then categories need to exist within type theory as particular types, there are some weird disconnects on this in the literature

[18:08:41] <isekaijin> lpapp: I have no idea why most mathematicians count from 1. It is just sloppy.
[18:08:53] <joel135> right, a new problem with dependent type theory is that higher category theory doesn't come built in
[18:09:06] <isekaijin> lpapp: The only thing vaguely resembling an “excuse” that I can think of is that the harmonic sequence 1/n is not well defined if you count from 0.

[18:12:05] <dude12312414> isekaijin: my guess is because of N starting from 1, back from Peano's formulation of the axioms

[18:15:22] <mycroftiv> if i pick up an apple in my hand, i would prefer to call that the 'first apple' not the 'zeroth apple' and mapping the index to the cardinality is not insane here

[18:16:19] <joel135> in a technical context you can say 'the apple with index 5' to mean the sixth apple
[18:16:26] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: It is arbitrary in a sense. Why does the cardinality have to match the index of the last element?
[18:16:31] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: What is so special about the last element?
[18:16:40] <lpapp> Maybe, English screwed it up :))))
[18:16:47] <mycroftiv> i dont think anything has to be anything, im arguing against a canonical choice being correct
[18:17:16] <mycroftiv> arguing against the claim that 'mathematicians are counting wrong'
[18:17:44] <isekaijin> If no canonical choice is correct, then that is a good argument for counting from zero, as the size of a list will not be the index of any of its element.
[18:17:54] <lpapp> mycroftiv: no one has said that
[18:17:57] <isekaijin> elements*
[18:18:19] <lpapp> mycroftiv: what I said was if the algorithm is meant to be programmed, why would you do non-programming context out of it
[18:18:35] <lpapp> I am pretty sure CLRS algos are for programming since they write pseudocode after all.
[18:18:43] <isekaijin> I absolutely hated it when my ODE professor wrote polynomials or power series like (constant term) + (series of nonconstant terms).
[18:18:47] <lpapp> I think it was just a really bad choice for writing that book
[18:19:00] <isekaijin> Like, put the constant term inside the damn series, goddammit.
[18:19:18] <isekaijin> This is what happens when people count from one.
[18:19:23] <isekaijin> It makes people do things like this.
[18:19:25] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: i actually habitually index from 0 because ive spent more time doing programming in C than math, actually

[18:22:25] <joel135> if you start counting at either 0 or 1, how does this affect the name of an 'object at limiting (infinite) position'?
[18:22:26] <mycroftiv> nlab shows higher category theory starts counting from (-2)groupoid
[18:22:59] <isekaijin> Any reason why non-higher-category theorists should care about higher category theory?
[18:23:44] <isekaijin> joel135: It doesn't. You can truncate a finite prefix of a sequence, without altering its limit (or maybe even limit*s*, if your space is not Hausdorff), if it has any.
[18:23:50] <mycroftiv> it was an example of a context people count from -2 since dude123 mentioned it, the whole n-truncation level thing has always annoyed me because its so weird
[18:24:16] <joel135> seems like if positions are ordinal numbers, you would call it something like omega, whereas if positions start at 1, you would have to call it omega+1
[18:24:19] <isekaijin> It kind of makes sense to me, but I don't see any practical reason to be concerned with it.
[18:24:55] <isekaijin> It just doesn't show up in anything that I'm trying to prove.
[18:25:04] <lpapp> Do not get me wrong, I am okay with 1 if it is not a programming book, but in a programming book, this is a fatal failure in my book (pun semi-intended :P)
[18:25:39] <joel135> (if a position is a set of all previous ordinals)
[18:26:17] <dude12312414> lpapp: it's unfortunate yeah. but there's not much you can do about it besides just carefully translating the index when implementing the algorithm
[18:26:20] <joel135> so not only would there be no position 0, there would be no position omega
[18:27:01] <joel135> ('previous' in the '≤' sense)

[18:29:16] <lpapp> but when the whole logic is built around something being 0 or 1, and then you have to interpret it into a different kind of logic, like a different loop, etc, then that is work.

[18:31:49] <lpapp> regarding not all programming languages start from 0, I do not know, it may be true like some obscure "programming" languages start from 1, but still, they are the minority, the book should be written for the majority for sure :)

[23:16:12] <kilobyte_ch> Hello, I have a math problem. I have a data counter in the range 0-n. Now I need to align a 6 char keyword to this data counter. This results in following input=>output: 0=>0, 1=>1, .. , 5=>5, 6=>0, .. , 11=>5, 12=>0, 13=>1. How can I calcualte this mathematically?

[23:17:29] <river> 7=>1 8=>2 9=>3 10=>4
[23:17:40] <river> ah its remainder when dividing by 6
[23:17:43] <NllPtr> yes
[23:17:45] <river> so you can use n % 6
[23:17:47] <NllPtr> it's taking mod 6

[23:49:33] <u1> is this true: any number in degree 0 equals 1?
[23:50:44] <u1> is that true any number divided by itself equals 1?
[23:51:07] <somiaj> what is a 'number in degree 0'
[23:51:13] <somiaj> and no 0/0 is not equal to 1
[23:51:16] <u1> 5^0
[23:51:28] <somiaj> yes, by definition x^0 = 1 for every real number x.
[23:51:35] *** Joins: yotsuba-chan (~yotsuba@93-172-241-53.bb.netvision.net.il)
[23:51:40] <somiaj> but every non-zero number divided by itself is equal to 1 by definition
[23:51:43] <u1> why 0/0 is not 1?
[23:51:48] <somiaj> because it is undefined
[23:52:24] <decker> becuase 0^0 != 0/0
[23:52:27] <somiaj> if 0/0 = a, then a*0 = 0, but a*0 is always 0, so a can be any number, hence it is best to make 0/0 undefined since assigning it a value could make other things inconsistant.
[23:53:26] <somiaj> from a calculus perspective, 0/0 is indeterminate form, and you can set up problems that make limits that approach 0/0 have any value, so yet again, best to just keep it undefined because there is no useful value to assign that operation.
[23:54:01] <u1> infinity / 0 isn't = 1?
[23:54:15] <somiaj> on the other hand if 1/0 = a, then a*0 = 1, but 0 = 1 is false, so dividing any non-zero number by 0 makes no sense, thus we just don't define division by zero
[23:54:25] <decker> no it would be a bigger infinity  ... 1/0.0001 = 100000

[23:54:41] <somiaj> inifinty is not a real number, so it if working with algebra on the real numbers, best to not think of it as a number, but as a limit
[23:55:08] <dude12312414> technically 0^0 should be undefined as well
[23:55:25] <u1> then what is number?
[23:55:34] <decker> yes; though it's approached as 1 from the left and right without a slope
[23:55:38] <somiaj> There are number systems which add in infinity, but in such number systems you loose some standard properities you may be useful.
[23:55:44] <decker> so... it'd be pretty safe to say that that operation is aslo 1
[23:55:59] <u1> infinity / infinity <> 1 ?
[23:56:05] <somiaj> dude12312414: that would be a pain though, sum_{n=0}^inf a_n x^n wouldn't be defined at zero...
[23:56:21] <dude12312414> yeah it's convenient for that
[23:56:28] <somiaj> and it is just clunky to write a_0 + sum_{n=1}^inf a_n x^n

[23:57:19] <dude12312414> it's just that in general lim f(x)^g(x) when f(x) and g(x) -> 0 doesn't always give 1 (it does in the case of x^x)
[23:57:46] <somiaj> yea, the definition of 0^0 doens't make all functions with a 0^0 point continous, but it is useful in other contexts to make 0^0 = 1
[23:57:57] <CarloWood> Hi. I am writing a program to solve a chess-like puzzle. I am having a hard time to think of the right algorithm :(. Hence to following question:
[23:58:06] <u1> it looks like 1 is not a number hehe...
[23:58:35] <somiaj> numbers are what we define them to be. There are lots of different number systems.
