[02:57:17] <ash_worksi> I was just told the other day I think I shouldn't need to do `read ... <<<"$var"` but I want to split a string to an array... should I just use `(IFS='|'; arr=($string))` or something?
[03:00:24] <tirnanog> no, you shouldn't.
[03:00:42] <greycat> !split
[03:00:43] <greybot> split(1): POSIX command to break a file into multiple pieces by lines or bytes; or, to split a string into an array of substrings: IFS=: read -ra array <<< "foo:bar:baz" (but see !pf47)
[03:00:43] <ash_worksi> tirnanog: the former or latter?
[03:00:54] <ash_worksi> greycat: yeah, I literally just did that
[03:01:02] *** Quits: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:01:07] <tirnanog> the latter is clearly wrong.
[03:01:16] <greycat> the important thing is that you understand *why* array=($string) is bad.
[03:01:19] <ash_worksi> greycat: so, then, it's fine to use `<<<` there?
[03:01:26] <greycat> !pf47
[03:01:26] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf47 -- Don't do this! -- IFS=, read -ra fields <<< "$csv_line"
[03:01:31] <ash_worksi> greycat: I figured it was bad
[03:01:38] <ash_worksi> greycat: yeah I did that too
[03:02:11] <greycat> <<< is the preferred method, but it has caveats, and you need to be aware of them.  a=($foo) is worse.
[03:02:13] <ash_worksi> tirnanog: that's why I said "or something"... I was basically asking "should it look more like..." without knowing completely what I'm doing
[03:02:19] <greycat> there is no good way.
[03:02:53] <ash_worksi> okay,  should revisit my logs and see when ppl were telling me not use use `<<<` (I don't think it had anything to do with csvs)
[03:03:00] <ash_worksi> I should*
[03:03:04] <tirnanog> sounds like nonsense but, yes, the context would be useful.
[03:03:08] <greycat> We need context.  There are definitely times when <<< is not the right tool.
[03:03:29] <greycat> For splitting a string into substrings, where there are no newlines in the input, <<< is fine.
[03:03:49] <tirnanog> the reason that the latter method is bad as that you then rely on word splitting and all the unintended behaviour that accompanies it. eliding empty fields, pathname expansion etc.
[03:03:54] <greycat> Perhaps you were doing something like  foo <<< $(bar)   which is DEFINITELY bad, and would have got you yelled at.
[03:07:00] <ash_worksi> greycat: yes, I finally found that in the logs just now
[03:07:20] <ash_worksi> greycat: it was about using <<<$(wc ...)
[03:07:30] <greycat> use < <() instead

[03:12:10] <ash_worksi> oh well.
[03:12:14] <greycat> Imagine you're shopping for a car.  You go to the dealer and there are two cars available.  You test drive both.  The first one goes forward when you depress the accelerator, and turns when you turn the wheel, and stops when you press the brake.

[03:35:25] <xx> what's the reason for the difference between those two?
[03:35:30] <greycat> !<<
[03:35:30] <greybot> Here documents. cat <<EOF followed by several lines of text, followed by the literal string EOF on a new line, NOT indented. The portion between the EOFs is passed to the command as standard input. If 'EOF' is 'quoted', substitutions WON'T be done; otherwise they are. See <<- for the indented variety.
[03:35:47] <xx> awesome, thanks!
[03:36:56] <xx> cat > myfile.txt << EOF
[03:37:05] <xx> just to verify, that last space never matters, right?
[03:37:27] <greycat> correct

[06:32:36] <loganlee> hi guys what is -I option in xargs for? i read the man page and i can't understand in simple terms
[06:33:13] <loganlee> and also is -L 1 same as -n 1 ?
[06:33:25] <neshpion> -I lets you specify a keyword which will be replaced by the arg.  Typically i see people use -I{} and then {} stands-in for the arg.  This is useful when you need to position an arg somewhere in the middle of some other hand-typed args
[06:34:13] <neshpion> that way use of xargs can kind of look like the use of find's -exec
[06:34:52] <neshpion> but it does force xargs to run the given command once for each arg, instead of piling them all at the end
[06:34:53] <loganlee> sorry what does it do here? $ find . -type f -not -name '*gz' -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} rm -v {}
[06:35:28] <neshpion> it runs `rm -v {}` for each arg, where {} is the filename piped in from find
[06:36:00] <tirnanog> i.e. the same thing as find ... -exec rm -v {} \; would have, just with unnecessary ceremony, and more slowly than -exec rm -v {} + would have.
[06:36:15] <neshpion> but honestly that could have used -exec instead of xargs:  `find . -type f -not -name '*.gz' -exec rm -v {} +`
[06:36:15] <loganlee> why can't we do $ find . -type f -not -name '*gz' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -v {} \; instead?
[06:36:43] <neshpion> because without -I{}, the {} is a literal {} instead of being replaced by xargs to be the arg
[06:37:06] <neshpion> -I{} tells xargs "anytime you see {} in the command, replace it with an arg, move to next arg and repeat, etc"
[06:37:29] <neshpion> {} \; is meaningful only to find -exec, it is not valid general syntax
[06:37:49] <loganlee> gotcha
[06:38:55] <loganlee> lastly, is -L 1 same as -n 1 ?
[06:38:56] <tirnanog> or rather, the semicolon is. it's just that it's also meaningful to the shell, so has to be escaped in order for the shell not to interpret it as a control operator.

[06:50:22] <shbot> tirnanog: would invoke whatever with 2 arg(s)
[06:50:54] <tirnanog> anyway, you should just use -exec. xargs is only occasionally useful.
[06:51:26] <emanuele6> also find has -delete so you should use that instead of -exec rm 
[06:51:26] <loganlee> /query shbot
[06:52:23] <tirnanog> e.g. -print -delete (GNU only).
[06:52:39] <tirnanog> well, maybe not GNU-only but not standard, anyway.
[06:58:18] <loganlee> tirnanog: thank you for your example. why the -L1 example says 1 arg then 2 args?
[06:58:42] <tirnanog> loganlee: it's explained in the man page. note that one of the input lines has trailing whitespace.
[06:59:56] <loganlee> Use at most max-lines nonblank input lines per command line.  Trailing blanks cause an  input  line  to  be logically continued on the next input line.
[07:01:39] <loganlee> so is it saying "foo\n" is treated as 1 arg and "bar \nbaz\n" is treated as 2 args?

[07:02:32] <tirnanog> you have to remember that, without -0, it mimics word splitting.
[07:03:42] <tirnanog> so, as a result of the line-orientation and signalling a continuation, we end up with "bar baz" that's then split and used as two distinct arguments.

[07:34:35] <neshpion> can't filenames contain null bytes too? :DDD

[07:46:26] <tirnanog> loganlee: it's a string terminator in C. that makes it the ideal delimiter. as far as unix derivatives go, pathnames cannot contain nul. the same goes for windows, if I recall correctly
[07:46:53] <emanuele6> loganlee: many of the GNU coreutils and tools support a -0 or --null option, not just find
[07:47:02] <loganlee> ok thx guys
[07:47:14] <emanuele6> here is a couple of complex examples for you: https://paste.debian.net/1206404/
[07:49:14] <loganlee> emanuele6: thx i'll have a look
[07:50:19] <tirnanog> the cut is unnecessary, really. consider: find -printf '%T+/%p\0' | ... | while IFS=/ read -rd '' _ path; do ...
[07:51:49] <emanuele6> that's a bash pitfall
[07:51:57] <tirnanog> no it's not.
[07:52:52] <emanuele6> # IFS=/; read -rd '' _ a < <(printf 'x\0x/'); declare -p a
[07:52:53] <shbot> emanuele6: declare -- a=""
[07:53:01] <emanuele6> oops
[07:53:07] <emanuele6> # IFS=/; read -rd '' _ a < <(printf 'x/x/\0'); declare -p a
[07:53:09] <shbot> emanuele6: declare -- a="x"
[07:53:11] <emanuele6> see
[07:53:33] <emanuele6> !pf 47
[07:53:33] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf47 -- Don't do this! -- IFS=, read -ra fields <<< "$csv_line"
[07:53:54] <tirnanog> no, you're mistaken. you're distorting the use case.
[07:54:20] <emanuele6> it will trim any trailing / from the output of find
[07:54:27] <emanuele6> maybe it doesnt matter in this case
[07:54:34] <emanuele6> but it definitely not clean
[07:54:53] <tirnanog> your first example doesn't reflect the use case at all.
[07:55:13] <emanuele6> the first example was a mistake, i said "oops"
[07:56:01] <tirnanog> as for the second, %p doesn't produce directories with a trailing slash, so it's completely irrelevant.
[07:56:23] <emanuele6> maybe it is, but still a relying on a pitfall
[07:56:25] <tirnanog> it is, in fact, clean.
[07:56:57] <tirnanog> there is no pathname produced by the given format that can defeat it. if you believe otherwise, prove it.

[08:01:18] <emanuele6> still, you are correct that cut is unnecessary
[08:01:29] <emanuele6> and the pitfall could be avoided by using -printf '%T+\t%p/\0'

[08:03:17] <tirnanog> nope. in fact, you would then be introducing one in the cutless case.

[08:03:23] <shbot> tirnanog: declare -- path="foo"

[08:03:45] <tirnanog> # printf 'timestamp\t\tfoo\0' | { IFS=$'\t' read -rd '' _ path; declare -p path; }
[08:03:46] <shbot> tirnanog: declare -- path="foo"
[08:04:10] <tirnanog> as compared to ...

[08:04:19] <shbot> tirnanog: declare -- path="       foo"
[08:04:27] <tirnanog> don't be so quick to shoot things down.
[08:04:35] <emanuele6> yeah, i meant to say -printf '%T+/%p/\0'
[08:05:17] <tirnanog> ok. but, then we're back to the -printf format guaranteeing that it is unnecessary.
[08:05:24] <tirnanog> anyway, I get your point.
[08:06:29] <tirnanog> pitfalls are important. no question of that. but they should not be a stick used to beat provably correct code with.
[08:07:29] <emanuele6> the solution was to just add a / after the %p in your solution :/
[08:07:51] <tirnanog> it's completely unnecessary.
[08:07:53] <tirnanog> for the case.
[08:08:00] <tirnanog> that's the thing you seem to be missing.
[08:08:35] <Gamma> The !pf is specifically about input formats where the delimiter could be escaped or quoted

[13:11:34] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001 -- How can I read a file (data stream, variable) line-by-line (and/or field-by-field)?
[13:11:47] <Soliton> do you think xargs sees the quotes?
[13:11:48] <tirnanog> why?
[13:12:11] <tirnanog> # printf '<%s> ' foo 'foo'
[13:12:12] <shbot> tirnanog: <foo> <foo>
[13:13:02] <Soliton> hard to guess what you hope to do anyway. do you want cp to be called for each word on each line?
[13:13:22] <loganlee> yes

[13:14:32] <Soliton> while read -ra paths; do for path in "${paths[@]}"; do cp -v ./copyme.txt "$path"; done; done
[13:15:40] <geirha> why does whatever program you're parsing print multiple paths on a single line to begin with though?
[13:15:42] <tirnanog> I'm not convinced that was a real goal, as opposed to academic fiddling.

[13:21:16] <loganlee> that's why i used -0 on xargs
[13:21:28] <tirnanog> in GNU xargs, -0 disables a swathe of behaviours that you are unlikely to find in any way useful. this was discussed earlier.
[13:22:12] <loganlee> well `printf "%s\n" ./aaaa/ ./tmp1/ | xargs -I {} cp -v ./copyme.txt {}` didn't work as i posted earlier

[13:30:45] *** Joins: shad (~shad@user/shad)
[13:30:46] <Soliton> what??
[13:30:57] <Soliton> do you see how the delimiter of \n is ignored?
[13:32:42] <Soliton> the simple takeaway from the example is that xargs does a bunch of nonsense.
[13:32:54] <Soliton> so you use xargs -0 if you can or forget about it.
[13:33:05] <loganlee> gotcha
[13:33:55] <ormaaj> I can barely remember what xargs does. It's that useless.
[13:34:13] <loganlee> so is `printf "%s\0" ./aaaa/ ./tmp1/ | xargs -0 -I {} cp -v ./copyme.txt {}` a good practice?
[13:34:30] <Soliton> useless -I but sure.
[13:34:38] <tirnanog> for d in aaaa tmp1; do cp -v copyme.txt "$d/"; done

[15:01:45] <earnestly> loganlee: You're going to end up calling cp for each input so you might as well use a for loop as tirnanog noted and avoid all the portability issues
[15:03:45] <loganlee> earnestly: setting to xargs -I {} makes it process one input at a time
[15:03:53] <earnestly> loganlee: That's what I noted, yes
[15:04:09] <earnestly> So you gain nothing from using xargs in a non-portable manner
[15:07:27] <earnestly> The main reason to use xargs today is when you have to accomodate for ARG_MAX splitting while using a command that would otherwise be very slow to run for each individual inputs (assuming the command even makes sense with arguments being arbitrarily split across multiple invocations)
[15:08:40] <koollman_> my other reasons to use xargs is doing stuff in parallel, too. or as a quick way to avoid a loop

[15:10:18] <earnestly> Soliton: I did come up with this nearly legitimate use of xargs: https://0x0.st/-4Qp.txt
[15:10:41] <earnestly> koollman_: If you're going to include GNU xargs or other implementations then they offer more, sure
[15:10:42] <ormaaj> An xargs with a way to pass field lengths out-of-band would be kind of interesting, but that would involve multiple input streams and I don't know that  there's a good way to do two synchronous pipes one for data and one for signaling.
[15:10:48] <earnestly> But
[15:10:50] <earnestly> !wait-n
[15:10:50] <greybot> Run up to 5 processes in parallel (bash 4.3): i=0 j=5; for elem in "${array[@]}"; do (( i++ < j )) || wait -n; my_job "$elem" & done; wait
[15:10:59] <earnestly> This is is much easier to manage than xargs -P
[15:11:38] <earnestly> ormaaj: I showed you that but with fifos
[15:13:03] <koollman_> earnestly: well, yeah. strictly posix xargs is rather limited. not even -r . -r and -P are supported sufficiently for my need, in gnu, freebsd and busybox  :)
[15:13:34] <ormaaj> eh? "fifo" usually refers to a pipe no? (in shell context)

[15:15:36] <ormaaj> Oh that. I didn't realize that's what you were doing ^^
[15:16:02] <koollman_> earnestly: I sometimes agree with that. not in this case, though :)
[15:16:47] <earnestly> And things like parallel, xe, xargs -P etc. make scripts worse simply because the manner by which you have to nest multiple DSLs becomes a nightmare while exposing yourself to easy ACE

[15:19:36] <earnestly> I don't mean trivial vs. large project.  I mean trivial vs. calling awk

[18:16:15] <lavaball> so i have darkplaces dedicated server running. i tee the output into a file. now if the output contains "heal" or "cure" i would like to put in "status" in the console, so that the server shows me ... well, the status.  i thought about awk and then via tmux insert-keys, but that seems complicated. is there a better way? can i make a bash script doing that?

[20:54:14] <diverdude> Hi, I have this makefile: https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e/blob/master/Makefile but I have to instruct the makefile where it can find the SDL.h   Can i somehow do that by making a bash variable?
[20:55:01] <phy1729> !make
[20:55:02] <greybot> Make is not bash, and Makefiles are not scripts. Ask in ##workingset and read http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/ or the help documents of your version of make.

[22:55:48] <emanuele6> i noticed that on the bashFAQ page, from faq34; all the links are shifted by one 
[22:56:16] <emanuele6> the page is immutable so i can't fix it
[22:56:44] <neshpion> !faq34
[22:56:44] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/034 -- Can I do a spinner in Bash?
[22:57:09] <emanuele6> neshpion: this page https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ
[22:57:31] <greycat> Stupid blank lines.
[22:57:52] <greycat> And no it's not the BashFAQ page.  It was specifically the most recently edited page.
[22:58:38] <neshpion> i can't see what you mean by all the links are shifted by one
[22:58:45] <greycat> They're fixed now.
[22:59:06] <greycat> Someone introduced a blank line between the <<Anchor>> and the == header == on 035.
