[00:24:39] <aartaka> lagash: Are escape codes real frequent? If so, we can try auto-detecting them, they're pretty outstanding at least to the human eye (:
[00:29:47] <pjb> fruits feed bugs.

[04:01:16] <opalvaults[m]> Is there a variable setting for opening the link as soon as I'm finished with the link key-combination? instead of having to press enter when finished, or insert-mode when I'm in a text field?
[04:01:46] <opalvaults[m]> qutebrowser, vimium, etc. automatically open the links when you've done the keypress associated with the link so i figure there must be some equivalent with nyxt :)
[04:14:50] <waleee> opalvaults[m]: aartaka added this for hints https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/734e38fabfed955152d8943ffdef83c2a1038fe8
[04:22:09] <waleee> and to enable, https://github.com/jmercouris/configuration/blob/master/.config/nyxt/init.lisp#L52 but swap "hints-alphabet ..." to "auto-follow-hints-p t"

[19:24:56] <lagash> It appears we do not, although we obviously use other shinera software like clss and spinnerets :)

[19:46:53] <lagash> On an unrelated note, can someone please help me figure out how to simplify this auto-rules config?? https://pastebin.mozilla.org/rsTiZMg1
[19:48:03] <lagash> See, I was going to use alex:conjoin disjoin etc but I don't think predicates are cached are they? The idea is to not keep on calling something that might eventually become more expensive..
[20:02:22] <jmercouris> lagash: you could define a function that produces a closure
[20:02:30] <ardon> lagash: LASS looks much more featureful and updated than cl-css, I wonder why the devs didn't go with it in the first place.
[20:02:30] <jmercouris> Or you could also just make a function
[20:03:14] <jmercouris> ardon: we had experience with a lot of the stuff Eitaro had written, so I guess we picked it up for that reason
[20:03:17] <aartaka> ardon: I guess LASS wasn't known (existent?) yet when we started using cl-css :)
[20:03:30] <jmercouris> Basically the same thing aartaka just said
[20:03:37] <aartaka> xD
[20:05:25] <jmercouris> Artyom
[20:05:36] <jmercouris> I’ve been watching this YouTube channel called “yeah Russia”
[20:05:40] <ardon> Lol, understood. Thanks for the heads up guys.
[20:05:45] <jmercouris> It’s mundane, but that is why I like it

[20:06:58] <jmercouris> There is something very endearing about this woman
[20:07:03] <lagash> jmercouris: I'm not following..
[20:07:42] <jmercouris> Ok so imagine this
[20:08:12] *** Quits: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[20:08:15] <jmercouris> (defun xyz () (lambda () (print “aha!”)))
[20:08:24] <jmercouris> This function returns a function
[20:08:30] <jmercouris> Now imagine if we did the following
[20:10:11] <jmercouris> (defun xyz () (let ((convoluted-predicate (Alexandria:disjoin …))) (lambda (i x) (funcall convoluted-predicate i x))))
[20:10:25] <jmercouris> I just typed that on my phone, so it’s possible I did it very wrong
[20:10:43] <jmercouris> Anyways the Alexandria disjoin predicate creation is capture in the lambda that you generate
[20:10:55] <jmercouris> Does that make more sense my Sumerian friend?
[20:11:06] <jmercouris> And then you just need to keep a reference to the lambda
[20:11:31] <jmercouris> By saving the result of an invocation to XYZ
[20:11:44] <jmercouris> You could use a defparamater or some singleton or something
[20:12:18] <lagash> Wouldn't it just be easier if Nyxt just cached things? :P
[20:14:35] <lagash> Or, wait... this whole problem is mostly because Nyxt stops looking past the first match, right?
[20:16:26] <jmercouris> Hm, I’m not sure I understand
[20:16:33] <jmercouris> I’ve been a afk tomato for a while
[20:16:48] <jmercouris> I’m not at my best mr lagash
[20:16:52] <jmercouris> I apologize
