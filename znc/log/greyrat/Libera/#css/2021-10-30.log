[00:34:04] <FunkyBob> ok... so I have a table with sticky header row...
[00:34:12] <FunkyBob> and it's working
[00:34:36] <FunkyBob> but i'm trying to work out why, since I don't have a relatively positioned parent
[00:34:48] <FunkyBob> is there some other trigger to get that sort of containment?

[12:35:23] <Stinger> hmm I changed the order of the rules and the effects swap around

[12:38:51] <Stinger> you mean do I have elements with the selected class? yes I can click around and see the change in the element inspector
[12:39:00] *** Joins: drej (~drej@user/drej)
[12:39:58] <Stinger> ok I'm an idiot - I fixed it
[12:40:19] <Stinger> I was putting semicolons at the end of my rules
[12:40:22] <Stinger> was breaking things
[12:40:52] <pavonia> :)
[12:42:11] <blei> to clarify i'd like to create a grid that pans infinitely in all directions in pure css
[12:44:28] <pavonia> blei: What do you mean by infinite here? When new cells are added it should advance in those directions somehow?
[12:44:44] <blei> those cells should be automatically created as you go
[12:45:16] <pavonia> Like a background pattern?
[12:45:30] <blei> almost like a background pattern
[12:46:47] <pavonia> With what differences to a background pattern?
[12:47:25] <blei> after i achieve the infinite grid, i will start adding functionality to the ability to use the cells
[12:48:07] <stenno> achieving infinite grid sounds like achieving nirvana
[12:48:23] <pavonia> If the cells are supposed to be some kind of elements, then you can't do it using CSS only
[12:53:59] <pyra_> blei: with that vague description I say you want to hit up js more so than css
[12:54:33] <pyra_> but for just a non functional pattern yeah css would work, the simplest would just to tile an image
[12:54:40] <blei> i have seen those https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66736000/how-can-i-make-infinite-grid-with-canvas
[12:55:11] <pyra_> yeah I was thinking of maybe canvas when I mentioned js
[12:55:19] <stenno> but why canvas
[12:55:28] <stenno> not needed here
[12:55:28] <pyra_> or just popping in dom elements
[12:56:50] <blei> yes canvas would require a lot of new code
[12:57:14] <pyra_> it sounds like you want something like a spreadsheet
[12:57:26] <blei> an infinite spreadsheet, though
[12:58:07] <blei> can go left, right, up, down, forever
[12:58:25] <pyra_> you just have to spit up your problem into chunks that are dynamically inserted and removed before coming into view
[12:59:22] <blei> also if you use cntrl+zoom out it should still be infinite (until the cells are too small to render)
[12:59:43] <pyra_> mhmm the same chunking technique would apply
[13:00:54] <pyra_> calculate what you need to display, then render it, and cull what you don't need to display, while tracking the entire dataset separately that's not directly tied to the presentation
[13:01:02] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[13:03:08] <blei> i wonder if i could simulate infinity by rendering many divs, say, 1 million above, below, left, right of the visible page
[13:04:08] <pyra_> if you try to render that many you'll have performance issues probably
[13:04:11] <blei> i'm surprised there is no way to do this. the idea that the page stops at the top and the left and you have to scroll right and down is a bizarre choice
[13:04:37] <pyra_> like I said you can, you just can't cram it all in the dom at once
[13:05:00] <pyra_> look into the "infinite scrolling" techniques out there to get a better idea of what I'm talking about

[13:08:10] <pyra_> blei: if you've ever played minecraft, think about the way they handle simulating an infinite world while only being able to render a small portion at a time
[13:11:19] <pavonia> Canvas with WebGL sound like the way to go here. DOM elements + CSS would be way to computation and memory intensive at some point
[13:15:46] <blei> with those you have to reinvent the wheel every time, like game developers
[13:23:31] <pavonia> There are probably already frameworks for such tasks
