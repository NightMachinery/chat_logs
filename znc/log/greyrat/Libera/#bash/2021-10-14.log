[00:09:28] <Filystyn> emanuele6 here is 100% solution: stuff | tr ' ' '\n' | while read -r word; do stuff; done
[00:10:31] <emanuele6> that is not the same
[00:11:15] <Filystyn> it's the bulls eye of what I was asking
[00:11:24] <emanuele6> maybe you meant: tr -s ' ' '\n'

[00:11:47] <emanuele6> yeah, !next, whatever
[00:12:20] <twkm> i probably would have used no tr but read -a with a second loop.
[00:12:48] <greycat> 16:10  Filystyn> also array is not very portable
[00:12:57] <emanuele6> that is the first answer we gave him, but he was only 80% satisfied with it

[03:51:22] <greycat> If I remember, it has to do with the redirection being done in a subshell because you're calling an external command (e.g. curl) vs. being done in the main shell process with a builtin.
[03:51:24] <Camusensei> Hmm, I can't reproduce the problem with shbot even though it's the same version of bash

[03:52:56] <Camusensei> I think that's the right explanation, but I don't get where shbot's and my bash differ
[03:55:54] <Camusensei> Shorter example:              unset i; cat /dev/null > "test_$((++i))"; echo "i=$i"      # Prints i= on some systems, i=1 on others

[04:42:22] <greycat> it's not clear what purpose the stdin redirection serves there

[04:43:56] <Camusensei> extern: <() will be replaced by a temporary filename (e.g. /dev/fd/63)
[04:44:04] <greycat> the lone < is redirection

[04:45:31] <Camusensei> no, it'll always produce an error
[04:45:32] <greycat> you mean some command in the *body* of the loop?  uh, sure, maybe.

[06:25:35] <llua> yearly reminder that select exist
[06:26:24] <jtgd> lol, ok glad I could provide that reminder
[06:27:13] <e36freak> it should be based on COLUMNS
[06:27:26] <e36freak> so you should be able to just set it to 1 or something temporarily and force it
[06:27:31] <e36freak> or just implement select yourself, it's super easy
[06:28:00] <e36freak> oCOLUMNS=$COLUMNS; select ...; done; COLUMNS=$oCOLUMNS
[06:28:07] <e36freak> erm
[06:28:12] <jtgd> yes!
[06:28:13] <e36freak> oCOLUMNS=$COLUMNS; COLUMNS=1; select ...; done; COLUMNS=$oCOLUMNS
[06:28:36] <jtgd> that is documented under 'COLUMNS' but not in the section for 'select'
[06:29:40] <jtgd> what is your alternative to select? and why would one do that?
[06:29:48] <e36freak> you could also just kill yourself with -WINCH instead of storing/restoring COLUMNS afterward
[06:29:58] <jtgd> yeah I saw that
[06:30:08] <e36freak> print what you want to print and then use read?
[06:30:27] <e36freak> i tend to not do interactive things in scripts anyway, don't find it to be useful very often
[06:30:33] <e36freak> that's what arguments are for
[06:30:45] *** Joins: aaro (~aaro@user/aaro)
[06:30:47] <jtgd> right but you have to read a number and then match that to what you  wrote
[06:31:05] <e36freak> array
[06:31:05] <jtgd> depends
[06:31:27] <jtgd> yup, array. not too hard, but harder than just using select
[06:31:28] <e36freak> but you do you
[06:32:00] <jtgd> i do things different ways for different tasks. sometimes interactive is better
[06:32:19] <jtgd> thanks for your help

[10:12:33] <CyberShadow> Hi, I'm designing a new tool (actually redesigning an old tool), and I'm trying to get the CLI as consistent with standard POSIX tools (grep/sed/awk) as possible. Would appreciate any feedback: https://github.com/CyberShadow/reduce/tree/next#readme , man page: https://cy.md/reduce/
[10:13:16] <hyrcanus> a new tool to do what?
