[00:09:52] <ogra> snap info chromium ... look at the "publisher" entry
[00:10:10] <ogra> packages with green checkmark come from a verified and trustworthy publisher
[00:10:18] <beuys> ogra: Where?
[00:10:34] <ogra> in the output of "snap info chromium"
[00:10:38] <beuys> ogra: I don't have Ubuntu. I am reading about it, consider trying it.

[00:16:30] <beuys> So how can I figure out if Chromium on Ubuntu is maintained by Canonical or by "the community"?
[00:16:42] <ogra> it takes a while and some prrofing that you are capable before you are granted upload rights (often years) ... before that you submit patches to bug reports that someone else verifies and merges into the package for you
[00:16:56] <ogra> by loking at the snap store page .... https://snapcraft.io/chromium
[00:17:19] <ogra> see at the top ... there is the maintainer under the package name ...
[00:17:26] <ogra> and there is a green checkmark ...

[02:38:03] <xboxbml> hey all. I'll ask again.. has anyone ever tried to run ubuntu on a macbook air? I have 2015 Air. I can run Linux Mint on it fine installed on a 512gb SD card in the reader, but Ubuntu will only run in live mode. It will not install on another 512gb SD card i have in the reader. It's been a while since i tried it again. Don't remember all the details.

[02:56:32] <xboxbml> well, thanks.. it seems someone has done it.. not sure why it wouldn't work for me. Maybe it wants to be on the internal drive? I didn't want to have it on the internal, just the 512gb SD card and just boot from it when I want to play with Ubuntu. That's what I do with the Mint SD card. Still have macos on the 2tb internal. It's my main machine. I'm just learning linux so...
[02:57:19] <ravage> if you just want to play around install a VM

[06:39:33] <klausfiend> guiverc: specifically the 20.04 LTS autoinstaller
[06:40:10] <klausfiend> the new method doesn't use preseed any longer and it doesn't seem to respect the options i used to use with preseed to specify the boot NIC
[06:40:56] <guiverc> ubiquity? subiquity?  calamares?  you've not said if desktop, server, flavor etc. that define the installer used on ISO

Note however it relies on MulticastDNS for discovery (zeroconf/bonjeur) so firewall rules or network organisation can cause problems. E.g. the printer needs to be in the same Ethernet broadcast domain as the PC

[08:46:19] <klausfiend> dbungert: so i'm pretty well-read on preseed but this subiquity stuff is still pretty new to me, where does the actual bootstrap tooling get loaded from? cpio tells me the only thing in the U20 live ISO initrd is some kernel microcode
[08:46:52] <dbungert> I'm fuzzy on that part, I mostly know what goes on once subiquity takes over :)
[08:46:53] <pony> how can I add a launcher to the dashboard for an executable that lives at ~/.local/kitty.app/bin/kitty? It doesn't let me 'add to favourites'

[18:25:30] <jsmooth> I just downloaded Matrix screensaver as a JAR file. How do I install it so it is loaded?
[18:25:44] <laurus> ioria: When I open a test scanned PDF in GIMP, it's 821 pixels by 1092, not 850 by 1100. The ratios are different: 0.7518315 vs 0.7727273.

[18:32:38] <oerheks> does that matrix jar site give install instructions?

[18:32:56] <ubottu> To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[18:33:07] <oerheks> on that wiki it tells you how to select a java version

[18:37:17] <oerheks> laurus, simplescan gui gives papersize, standard set to automatic
[18:37:37] <oerheks> so, use the gui?
[18:37:40] <laurus> oerheks: I set it to Letter. It doesn't fix this, this is "slightly off"
[18:37:54] <laurus> As I mentioned, the resulting scans should be 8.5 x 11 but they're not, they're slightly a different ratio.
[18:38:06] <laurus> Or is it just that any scanner cannot fully scan to the margins of a page?
[18:39:11] <oerheks> 8.5 x 11 inch is A4..
[18:39:32] <laurus> oerheks: No
[18:40:02] <laurus> A4 is 210 mm x 297 mm, which is about 8-1/4 in x 11-3/4 in.
[18:40:19] <laurus> Letter is 8.5 in x 11 in.
