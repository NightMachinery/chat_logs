[00:45:38] <systemfault> EdFletcher: Cool
[00:45:46] <blueagain> Since I know next to no Erlang.
[00:46:05] <EdFletcher> at most you might call into erlang libs but that's pretty straightforward. you may have to read erlang docs i.e. erlang source which is obtuse, but you get used to it.
[00:46:12] <EdFletcher> yeah the last time i used erlang was decades ago in college.

[00:50:18] <EdFletcher> yeah technically "hex" is the package manager but it's all built into mix and it's all _quite_ good, nearly on-par with npm. one of the rare "gets it mostly right" package managers
[00:50:37] <ljharb> EdFletcher: does it allow two different versions of the same package to be in use at the same time?
[00:50:56] <EdFletcher> ljharb: you know i honestly don't know, it hasn't come up for me yet. i doubt it though.
[00:51:00] <ljharb> EdFletcher: if not, then it's nowhere near as good as npm
[00:51:11] <EdFletcher> i did say "nearly" 😃
[00:51:11] <ljharb> afaik there's only three non-broken package managers on the planet; npm, cargo (based on npm), and nix
[00:51:17] <ljharb> lol i think that's giving it too much credit
[00:51:25] <EdFletcher> nix is awesome for sure

[00:52:22] <ljharb> blueagain: oh right. maybe four :-p i haven't had time to look into it yet

[00:52:35] <buu> the joy is finding out what way

[05:25:42] <cthulchu> so, I've been debugging this snippet and so I had console logging in my catch. But it can't be there in prod. And I wanna kinda conceal it for prod, but have it there for future debugging

[05:26:08] <cthulchu> will the minifier even keep this line?
[05:27:05] <ljharb> cthulchu: most minifiers would replace that entire statement with null, yes
[05:27:22] <ljharb> cthulchu: but usually that's done by wrapping in `if (DEBUG) { … }`
[05:27:44] <cthulchu> yeah, I just don't wanna introduce DEBUG in this snippet
[05:27:46] <ljharb> cthulchu: where "DEBUG" is `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` or a global `DEBUG` or something
[05:27:52] <cthulchu> exactly

[07:48:57] <blahboybaz> Some web site or something?
[07:49:34] <wroathe> blahboybaz: Not simple, but popular JS engines are open source. You can review v8's source code.

[09:37:41] <blahboybaz> I don't understand something in this code (why it is "rating" and not "imdbRating" in line 137). The instructions are at the top indicating that it is imdbRating that should be checked against but I think this is something to do with what happens when you chain methods and I want to learn what is going on. Can anyone point out why the variable name has to be that?

[10:16:29] <theskillwithin> blahboybaz the first one I still get 401 on,  the pastebin I can see the code now.  but wish you did in a gist so there would at least be code highlighting but wtver

[13:08:45] <DPA> Is there some way to split arrays in 2 based on a filter? I want something like "let [match, nomatch] = my_array.group(x=>x>123)"
[13:08:45] <DPA> Running .filter multiple times just doesn't feel nice...
[13:09:39] <codebam> you can use one filter with multiple checks?
[13:10:36] <codebam> .filter((a) => a.x > 123 && a.y < 123)
[13:11:23] <DPA> That would still result in 1 array. I have 1 array, and want to split it into all matching a condition, and all not matching.

[22:08:50] <systemfault> The problem is that people never update them..

[22:15:37] <blueagain> for non-techies, it should read

[22:26:24] <qswz> it's evil, the origin of pollution and more
[22:26:26] <KevinX> I'm suggesting that there are a higher % of vulnerabilities out there that are not reported. Rather that the risk of that being true is much higher in WP than other systems
[22:26:53] <blueagain> qswz: you are using a phone / computer / whatever if you're here, so you're a part of the system.
