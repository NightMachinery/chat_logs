[02:44:13] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> probably using out of channel ANAM data or something
[02:44:15] <shibboleth> nice. reminds me of a.... well, this was a long time ago... i guess this was marketed for kids with prepaid subs or whatever, but you'd call their (0800-)number and they'd call you back and you'd "DTMF"/type the number you wanted to call
[02:44:25] <shibboleth> and it was marginally cheaper than the prepaid subs
[02:44:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @sysadmin you dial *67 before the number?
[02:44:58] <shibboleth> thing was, you could trick it into letting you "spoof" your number
[02:44:59] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Yes

[02:46:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> MCI's seeing the full data

[02:51:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> ok so it goes like this
[02:51:45] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Wait
[02:51:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @sysadmin you pay say, T-Mobile, right?
[02:51:55] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> for your phone plan/minutes/whatever

[02:52:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> let's say to get to MCI, t-mobile has to hand you off to verizon's network first
[02:52:09] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Calling MCI from a desk phone results in a different number read back to me after using *67
[02:52:23] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @sysadmin probably because of your trunking/access level setup

[02:53:50] <shibboleth> hunter: it was more meant as a question since it'd be gsm-specific (and inherent digital), how did this work on cdma and its analog predecessors?
[02:53:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the same way?
[02:54:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> both devices transmit the CID data to the network....

[03:03:56] <shibboleth> hunter: so ever since we moved on from... operators manually connecting wires and went on to those... spin-and-dial analog phones the... phone knew/sent its own number?

[09:03:14] <xe0n> yeah i wrote a wrapper for 365 app installs, adds a few options lol
[09:03:23] <xe0n> odt was updated today btw
[09:03:27] <xe0n> so grab the new build
[09:03:48] <xe0n> and make sure you download the en-gb language pack so you localise the install...font COLOUR instead of font COLOR
[09:03:49] <xe0n> :P
[09:04:31] <Work-BWMerlin> I have only downloaded it today after wiping my PC

[10:44:23] <nobyk> then the PING sound
[10:44:34] <SirSceptalot> I think you're talking about a microwave
[10:44:34] <nobyk> hmm that's nice
[10:44:37] <ClappedOutWaffle> I havent needed one in a long time. the only ones I have are from old ide systems. if I were to need one now I'd get ausb one
[10:47:09] <ClappedOutWaffle> usb sticks can more or less act like a CD if you really need things in a cd-like format

[10:47:42] <ClappedOutWaffle> yes
[10:47:45] <xe0n> laptops won't be including them unless they're workstation replacement, and even then...i wouldn't expect it. external usb drives lol
[10:47:48] <nobyk> What is a DVD made of actually
[10:47:51] <xe0n> but in desktop, yeah i have uhd drive
[10:47:57] <ClappedOutWaffle> its made of the same stuff that CDs are
[10:48:14] <ClappedOutWaffle> just a different laser wavelength that allows for smaller data area
[10:48:38] <nobyk> These days it's almost special for a laptop to have an ordinary USB port
[10:48:53] <ClappedOutWaffle> I hate that tbh

[10:49:02] <ClappedOutWaffle> ^
[10:49:10] <nobyk> yuk
[10:49:22] <ClappedOutWaffle> every laptop I've bought I intentionally seek out ones with USB and eth

[11:37:58] <tool> But they are fun to shoot
[11:37:59] <ClappedOutWaffle> at least a gun is fast
[11:38:08] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> yes
[11:38:12] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> thats why I buy them
[11:38:14] <ClappedOutWaffle> other ways are a bit slow and give you too much time to think about how you just done fucked up

[11:39:02] <ClappedOutWaffle> drive off a cliff? now you've got 20 seconds to think about if you should've done it. jump off a building/bridge, same thing. bleeding yourself out, waaay too much time to think about it

[11:39:19] <SirSceptalot> So the gun is just for a hobby and isn't actually related to the weight loss? Or is it something to help you get motivated to get up and be active?

[11:41:00] <SirSceptalot> I mean, I get that shooting a gun is prolly a fun hobby, but the fact that the first thing you said about it was related to suicide is slightly discomforting
[11:41:09] <ClappedOutWaffle> I mean, thats how you keep gang violence down, make it so expensive to shoot someone that its just not worth it :D
[11:41:39] <csws> ClappedOutWaffle: they'll shoot you and take your ammo probably :(

[11:43:20] <ClappedOutWaffle> Activ8, someone drove down the road next to me a year or so ago popping off. I woke up to police scouring for shell casings. I sleep with my head next to the window

[12:26:11] <teh_f4ll3n> I got stuck in Rome for a few days back in 2010(?) when all flights were being cancelled because of volcanic ash
[12:27:12] <Activ8> I visited Florence as well in 2014
[12:27:26] <Activ8> was eating ice cream 3am on the bridge it was that hot
[12:27:41] <ender> damn, now I want to move to Romania
[12:28:25] <SirSceptalot> italy has some kickass motorcycling roads
[12:29:38] <ender> according to my sister's boyfriend, italian motocyclists always die on the roads around his home village (he's from a mountain village that's near the italian border)
[12:30:25] <SirSceptalot> good thing I'm not an italian motorcyclist then, should be safe for me
[12:30:45] <ClappedOutWaffle> idk why that made me chuckle 
[12:32:54] <SirSceptalot> interesting read for me at the moment: https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/group-creation-conventions-for-active-directory

[12:37:34] <ClappedOutWaffle> anyone here know about sword history?
[12:38:25] <sd> 11<F​our 'n' Twenty Traveller Pie> Yes, up to a point...
[12:38:34] <SirSceptalot> ba dum tss
[12:38:37] <sd> 13<C​olour> At first swords didn't exist, then at some point they existed
[12:39:28] <ClappedOutWaffle> why are samurai swords (and most other swords for that matter) depicted as being super shiny, swords wouldnt have had any chroming/shine to them  until electroplating came along
[12:39:40] <ClappedOutWaffle> right?
[12:40:14] <ClappedOutWaffle> without excessive amounts of buffing/grinding, which idk if was really 'economical' for the times
[12:41:00] <SirSceptalot> because glint looks good on camera?
[12:41:19] <sd> 13<C​olour> Shiny look good on camera yes
[12:41:45] <SirSceptalot> I mean, you can get a lot of stuff up to a mirror finish by polishing
[12:41:47] <ClappedOutWaffle> right, but am I right in assuming / deducing that swords wouldnt have been anywhere near the shine/perfection that is depicted on films?
[12:42:10] <nobyk> two words
[12:42:11] <nobyk> holy
[12:42:11] <SirSceptalot> so I guess "grunt weapons" would not be so shiny, but someone's personal items might be given more love
[12:42:12] <nobyk> and wood
[12:42:51] <ClappedOutWaffle> its holly
[12:42:53] <ClappedOutWaffle> but ok
[12:43:26] <sd> 11<F​our 'n' Twenty Traveller Pie> They oil polished the fuckers

[12:44:14] <SirSceptalot> This is my sword. There are many like it, but this one is mine

[12:44:26] <ClappedOutWaffle> bah now I'm gonna have to go watch FMJ SirSceptalot 
[12:44:42] <teh_f4ll3n> a former colleague of mine is into HEMA. He ordered his training sword to work - wasn't nearly as shiny. Think of dull grey aluminium colour
[12:45:11] <SirSceptalot> that's prolly realistic for how they were delivered "back then" as well.
[12:45:21] <ClappedOutWaffle> teh_f4ll3n, yeah, but even then, I dont think actual used swords would be even that metallic shine
[12:45:59] <ClappedOutWaffle> I just cant figure out how for example a samurai or claymore would ever be polished well enough in the time era they were popular.
[12:46:12] <teh_f4ll3n> they would be scratched to bits unless it's a ceremonial sword that's polished to bits
[12:46:14] <ClappedOutWaffle> to have the same shine a cinema sword would
[12:47:02] <SirSceptalot> I think that, in general, the average sword was a lot more crap than what people now imagine they were
[12:47:21] <ClappedOutWaffle> ok well at least I feel a bit better in knowing I'm not the only one that thinks that
[12:47:24] <teh_f4ll3n> polishing masters would spend months polishing 1 sword in some cases I read
[12:47:43] <SirSceptalot> katana's have a somewhat mythical status, but the average katana was just made by some guy long ago with FAR less knowledge about metallurgy than today
[12:47:56] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[12:48:04] <SirSceptalot> s/katana's/katanas
[12:48:29] <SirSceptalot> There's also survivor bias in stuff like that
[12:48:33] <ClappedOutWaffle> teh_f4ll3n, so basically no one did it then heh
[12:49:00] <ClappedOutWaffle> I used to kendo with my friend way back when, and from an attack standpoint, they're pretty terrible without well coordinated moves. from a defensive standpoint they're terrible defense weapons and any defensive strikes will kill your blade
[12:49:07] <SirSceptalot> the swords we find or still have today are the ones that were well cared for, and that's most likely because they were a masterpiece that belonged to someone of import
[12:49:15] <teh_f4ll3n> In Japan, katana has a religious aspect to it as well, ClappedOutWaffle 
[12:49:23] <ClappedOutWaffle> true
[12:49:46] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm sure some would spend hours a day keeping their family heirlooms shiny
[12:50:10] <teh_f4ll3n> it's Japan after all
[12:50:45] <ClappedOutWaffle> the thought stemmed from Kill Bill, but extended to the general broadsword/claymore usage of medieval times
[12:53:07] <SirSceptalot> need help with engrish
[12:53:20] <SirSceptalot> what do you call the dept. or job of someone that makes sales offers?
[12:53:27] <ClappedOutWaffle> sales dept?
[12:53:53] <ClappedOutWaffle> or if they're hip and new and cool, 'customer experience dept'
[12:54:17] <SirSceptalot> I figured there would be a more specific name for the offer making guy, but I should prolly K.I.S.S. and just go with sales
[12:54:25] <teh_f4ll3n> Ilya Alekseev did a pretty decent piece on katanas recently. Though he didn't say much about polish
[12:55:08] <ClappedOutWaffle> yeh, idk. just seems like an actual proper era sword for most of those times would've been a very rough motherfucker except the blade
[12:56:44] <teh_f4ll3n> it depended on how good the smith was and who it was made for
[12:56:49] <teh_f4ll3n> greatly
[13:01:07] <teh_f4ll3n> ClappedOutWaffle, https://youtu.be/iqfIW-FurgI?t=59 partially answers your question. Pretty sure same applies to european swords of the era

[14:15:47] <haise01> lol
[14:16:03] <haise01> teh_f4ll3n: my take is that you should setup retro box on it :P
[14:16:09] <haise01> it allows for dev mode which you can switch on
[14:16:12] <haise01> and install emulators 
[14:16:22] * thegodsquirrel seconds this
[14:16:30] <thegodsquirrel> Love my 3DS emulator
[14:16:41] <teh_f4ll3n> unless it's SNES, I'm not interested :D

[14:17:59] <teh_f4ll3n> cool
[14:18:03] <teh_f4ll3n> I might just do that
[14:18:26] <haise01> I think you can do SNES games on it then 
[14:18:28] <haise01> and on top of that
[14:18:51] <haise01> you can flip switch back to factory mode (nothing should be erased iirc) and you can run OG Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One games as well :D
[14:18:58] <thegodsquirrel> Hell, with that console you could play PS1 games, etc
[14:19:04] <haise01> yep
[14:19:07] <haise01> so many options

[14:21:36] <teh_f4ll3n> that's just karma finally compensating for pretty much screwing me over for my entire life

[14:24:25] <haise01> teh_f4ll3n: its XGP = Xbox Game Pass
[14:24:47] <haise01> they are moving Xbox into brand for both PC and console from what I understand

[15:52:32] <teh_f4ll3n> I had to order 3x3100 and config them as swaps just so there's no downtime if the current hardware goes

[15:53:06] <sd> 13<C​olour> Other options prolly better at that point yeah
[15:53:06] <thegodsquirrel> Or you could just set them up in HA
[15:53:20] <haise01> I'd look at Palo Alto or Fortinet lol
[15:53:25] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[15:53:29] <sd> 13<C​olour> Palo Altos are expensive af right
[15:53:34] <thegodsquirrel> Enterprise shit is expensive, SW 
[15:54:11] <thegodsquirrel> and the subscriptions for every little feature
[15:54:15] <haise01> then I'd look at getting small server that is supported by OEM like Dell and slapping VyOS on it
[15:54:33] <teh_f4ll3n> Palo alto not really popular in the EU and I FUCKING HATE FORTINET

[16:44:31] <nobyk> PowerBeam looks  expensive
[16:44:38] <nobyk> when the images display an actual mast
[16:44:43] <nobyk> lol
[16:45:29] <PublicWiFi> anyone know how much data the barcode on the back of dell workstations contains?
[16:45:32] <thegodsquirrel> Meh, the Nanobeams get attached by a pipe clamp in most use cases
[16:45:46] <PublicWiFi> trying to find an easy way to import lots of assets into snipe-it without having to clicky clicky too much
[16:45:52] *** Quits: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo) (Read error: Connection timed out)
[16:46:17] <thegodsquirrel> I used csv when I did my imports
[16:46:27] <teh_f4ll3n> unplug the mouse, PublicWiFi. No clicky-clicky at all
[16:46:30] <PublicWiFi> yeah but making the CSV lol
[16:46:40] <thegodsquirrel> but I had some discrete lists of serials and what not
[16:46:41] <PublicWiFi> it would be dope to be able to scan in some data and format it to CSV
[16:47:05] <PublicWiFi> teh_f4ll3n: https://i.imgur.com/QDYNC3m.gif
[16:47:09] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm sure there are image readers that can do that
[16:47:34] <PublicWiFi> just wondering if these barcodes even have the data I want
[16:47:38] <PublicWiFi> prolly not 
[16:47:40] <thegodsquirrel> What happens when you scan the code into a google sheet?
[16:47:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> That pipe clamp setup with the Nanobeam doesn't seem very secure...
[16:47:42] *** Joins: scoobydoo (~scooby@user/scoobydoo)
[16:47:45] <PublicWiFi> wonder if dell has a service tag lookup api lol
[16:47:56] <JollyRgrs> pretty sure they do
[16:47:59] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Yes they do
[16:48:02] <PublicWiFi> oh sick nasty
[16:48:03] <JollyRgrs> though, they changed it a bit ago
[16:48:03] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> You have to register for it
[16:48:06] <JollyRgrs> used to be super ez
[16:48:07] <SirSceptalot> if it's a regular barcode it probably has dick all. A barcode is just a short string of text in a funky font
[16:48:07] <PublicWiFi> ahh okay
[16:48:15] <PublicWiFi> SirSceptalot: yeah you're prolly right
[16:48:16] <JollyRgrs> i had a PS script that would look it up and return wty info
[16:48:35] <PublicWiFi> I've used the pipe clamp setup at the mines with a couple wifi bridges, not my favorite setup
[16:48:36] <JollyRgrs> then they started to require something else to use API, i forget what... this was like 5-6 yrs ago?
[16:49:01] <PublicWiFi> JollyRgrs: nice ill check that out!
[16:49:24] <JollyRgrs> what info are you wanting?
[16:49:44] <JollyRgrs> just WTY info or shipped configuration info?
[16:50:00] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> We had a setup at my old office with a point to point during renovations to the temp location ~1 mile away. For some unknown reason the guy that set it up used 1/2" conduit as the mast and the damn thing vibrated when it got windy. Messed with the signal too much.
[16:50:01] <PublicWiFi> yeah warranty stuff
[16:50:15] <PublicWiFi> errr warrant and shipped config
[16:50:20] <PublicWiFi> cause we don't add any hardware usually

[16:50:45] <JollyRgrs> are you a dell techdirect customer?
[16:50:51] <PublicWiFi> i am not
[16:51:11] <PublicWiFi> im trynig to future proof since we're gonna be ordering a bunch of crap soonish
[16:51:14] <SirSceptalot> oh fuck never mind my dumbass with my dumbass link
[16:51:14] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I told them to use a metal fence post or top rail and was promptly ignored.... It wasn't even grounded either. Not sure how the setup didn't kill someone or something.

[16:51:48] <PublicWiFi> also im not trying to make it a habit of yall google for me or something LOL
[16:52:01] <PublicWiFi> I just happen to have an idea why chatting here and figure you guys are all way more expereicned than me and figure I'd ask
[16:52:10] <PublicWiFi> experienced*
[16:52:18] <JollyRgrs> there's lots of broken links b/c before tech direct requirement, it was easier, even a PS1 script floating around (but is broken now)
[16:52:34] <PublicWiFi> prolly make you register and get some kind of token or something
[16:52:38] <JollyRgrs> yup
[16:52:40] <JollyRgrs> good for 1 yr
[16:52:44] <JollyRgrs> looks like it is free to sign up
[16:52:45] <PublicWiFi> wonder why
[16:52:48] <JollyRgrs> just gotta "go through the proces"
[16:52:49] <PublicWiFi> people SLAMMING their api?
[16:52:53] <JollyRgrs> probs
[16:52:59] * AnonymooseReddtr yawns
[16:53:01] <JollyRgrs> so this way they can remove ppl who are abusing it
[16:53:10] <PublicWiFi> yup makes sense
[16:53:13] <JollyRgrs> you know how bad some ppl code things
[16:53:20] <PublicWiFi> i do, I'm some ppl
[16:53:22] <PublicWiFi> :D
[16:53:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> some peoples children i swear
[16:53:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[16:53:39] <JollyRgrs> "oops, my script is looping and hitting API request 100 times a second now... that i left running all weekend"
[16:53:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> rofl 
[16:53:54] <PublicWiFi> I usually have the courtesy to add in some sleeps after each call lol
[16:53:57] <PublicWiFi> like 1 second or something
[16:54:01] <csws> dell's old warranty API just had a single key that everyone shared
[16:54:07] <csws> I guess they finally dealt with that lol
[16:54:18] <PublicWiFi> csws: i setup netbox and now I'm too lazy to fill this shit in lol
[16:54:25] <csws> oh man
[16:54:28] <PublicWiFi> will you go to my network closet for me and document? :D
[16:54:48] <csws> yeah sure I'll PM my hourly rate
[16:54:56] <csws> also I only fly business class
[16:55:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> welp
[16:55:11] <PublicWiFi> I'm in my last phase of becoming 100% HIPAA compliant (we have scare documentation so that's the last step)
[16:55:21] <PublicWiFi> gotta have documentation and processed written down
[16:55:22] <AnonymooseReddtr> investment account is happy today
[16:55:22] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[16:55:27] <PublicWiFi> AnonymooseReddtr: nice man!
[16:55:34] <csws> I wonder if you can script something to generate a PDF with meaningless random graphs
[16:55:38] <csws> then just submit that
[16:55:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol csws
[16:55:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> probably
[16:55:57] <csws> we have 420 HP notebooks and 1337 dells
[16:56:01] <PublicWiFi> if we got audited I have some -*SHITTY*- stuff that would prolly allow them to give us soem time to clean up
[16:56:02] <csws> etc.
[16:56:06] <SirSceptalot> you mean like the graphs from literally any vendor's website?
[16:56:07] <PublicWiFi> but I hate half-assery
[16:56:16] <csws> PublicWiFi, well if you're worried about getting audited.. make sure to disable the changelog
[16:56:20] <PublicWiFi> lmfao
[16:56:20] <csws> (or set it to wipe after 1 day)
[16:56:35] <PublicWiFi> shit
[16:56:41] <csws> I think it defaults to 60 or 90 days
[16:56:42] <PublicWiFi> gotta write up a change management process soon god dammit
[16:56:47] <csws> haha
[16:56:48] <csws> ITIL.jpg
[16:56:58] <csws> what do you use for ITSM?
[16:57:05] <csws> "outlook" probably
[16:57:12] <PublicWiFi> more like "my buddy let me use his login for some website that give you hella templates for these scenarios".jpg
[16:57:36] <PublicWiFi> honeslty email, but I come from places that used ticket systems
[16:57:43] <csws> oh man
[16:57:48] <PublicWiFi> but we're so small I never really felt pressured to set one up
[16:57:50] <csws> no ITSM is going to make this a little harder
[16:57:55] <csws> is it literally just you?
[16:57:58] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[16:58:07] <csws> change management process
[16:58:09] <csws> step 1: e-mail myself
[16:58:12] <csws> step 2: seek approval from myself
[16:58:15] <PublicWiFi> BUT our client base has doubled since I've been here and I thought about setting up a ticketing system company wide
[16:58:16] <csws> step 3: do the needful
[16:58:19] <PublicWiFi> so we can all keep track of all our shit
[16:58:34] <yuken> love you PublicWiFi.
[16:58:36] <csws> god being the sole IT guy would suck
[16:58:44] <PublicWiFi> LOL making you feel better for your environment yuken ?
[16:59:01] <PublicWiFi> csws: the only part I hate is not having someone to check my sanity or bounce ideas off of

[17:00:27] <PublicWiFi> I make 66k which may not sound like a lot
[17:00:31] <csws> and setup cameras to alert if ICE vans pull up or something
[17:00:35] <PublicWiFi> but the CoL here is so fucking low
[17:00:40] <yuken> I'm at $20,000 PublicWiFi.
[17:00:41] * csws converts that to didgeridoo dollars
[17:00:47] <PublicWiFi> my house is like 2500 sq ft and cost me 160k

[17:01:10] <PublicWiFi> 30%-ish?
[17:01:12] <thegodsquirrel> only 160k lol
[17:01:16] <csws> not bad
[17:01:19] <csws> I get like 40%
[17:01:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> PublicWiFi Salary is relative with COL so 
[17:01:29] <PublicWiFi> ^
[17:01:29] <csws> well definitely 37%+
[17:01:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> sounds like 66k is nice where you are at
[17:01:34] <csws> but it's variable so I think it's close to 40
[17:01:36] <PublicWiFi> yeah I live very well in my city
[17:01:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> nice!
[17:01:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah

[17:14:54] <csws> god
[17:14:55] <tool> That is a half-step away from a single-wide trailer
[17:14:56] <yuken> csws, even at my mediocre income, if I live frugally I could probably own a home. so if I can find remote work out of The People's Republic of California, or similar...
[17:14:57] <csws> it's probably right next to the airport too
[17:14:58] <yuken> I'd kill for that.

[17:15:22] <yuken> I have an internship at a local company, 80 hours @ $20/hr, and if I get that job permanently I'd move up to about $50,000 a year.
[17:15:25] <csws> it's so close to the airport

[17:15:41] <PublicWiFi> didn't make sense to pay 500 bucks a month rent when we could pay 350 a month WITH insurance and taxes
[17:16:17] <yuken> PublicWiFi, yeah. If you aren't trying to be able to just up & move at any time, a house is cheaper than renting even short-term here.
[17:16:26] <csws> oh shit PublicWiFi fuck

[17:16:31] <csws> that shack is in an over 55s village

[18:27:42] <JollyRgrs> will you "save money" by having lights turn off quicker, etc? no
[18:28:07] <JollyRgrs> b/c you won't find a way to automate turning them off without still having some waste, and what you DO save won't make up the cost of the device itself + vampire draw

[18:28:24] <sd> 08<G​rippie> i just want to do it because it looks cool
[18:28:24] <PublicWiFi> no but it'd be dope for hass.io to recognize my phone's mac address hitting the wifi and turning on all the shit I use as soon as I walk in lol
[18:28:35] <JollyRgrs> you may grow to like it
[18:28:48] <JollyRgrs> it is so nice to walk into the kitchen and just ask google to turn on the kitchen light

[18:29:16] <PublicWiFi> I'd like to use a self-hosted assistant

[18:31:50] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> though*
[18:32:00] <JollyRgrs> how will your iot devices be contacted if they are 100% segregated w/o a bridge?
[18:32:11] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> can i just get an app that flushes the toilet while my kids are using it. because they dont seem to like to
[18:32:15] <PublicWiFi> UBT stuff is nice cause you can just setup a second SSID
[18:32:26] <PublicWiFi> I have a "controls" SSID that's VLAN'd
[18:32:35] <JollyRgrs> the hope is that your iot stuff can be all local... so you just make a VLAN that can't reach out to the internet, but you can still access them from your phone/PC on another vlan
[18:32:43] <PublicWiFi> ^
[18:32:57] <JollyRgrs> i have a few SSIDs... one for normal stuff, one for guest, and one for IoT things
[18:33:03] <JollyRgrs> IoT one is also only 2.4ghz
[18:33:09] <JollyRgrs> b/c many of them req. only 2.4
[18:33:22] <PublicWiFi> that's good though since it reaches further
[18:33:30] <JollyRgrs> that, too
[18:33:33] <sd> 08<G​rippie> JollyRgrs: i guess VLAN is enough then i guess
[18:33:46] <JollyRgrs> but many of the devices can't connect to 5ghz and if they are same SSID for 2.4 and 5, they won't connect
[18:33:51] <PublicWiFi> yeah I'd just VLAN em 
[18:33:53] <sd> 08<G​rippie> idk what made me think that physical segregation would be better lol
[18:34:03] <sd> 08<G​rippie> although I'm aware of VLAN leaks from years ago

[18:34:26] <PublicWiFi> I thought about hooking up my garage door as well but I think I'd rather not potentially allow an attacker to open any doors lol

[18:34:52] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: i'm on the fence about that as well
[18:35:06] <PublicWiFi> risk is low but impact is high as fuck
[18:35:16] <PublicWiFi> shit am I doing a SRA on my house automation? lol
[18:35:27] <JollyRgrs> my front door (schlage) lock is smart... but i can only ask google to lock it.... it only works w/ amazon's key thing as far as unlocking w/ voice
[18:35:29] <thegodsquirrel> The likelihood is very low
[18:35:46] <JollyRgrs> i like it b/c A) i can set the door to lock in 4 minutes. also my "goodnight" routine locks the door

[18:37:21] <thegodsquirrel> Yup
[18:37:32] <PublicWiFi> JollyRgrs: i tell you about my home-wide speaker idea? Setting up a motion detector and a speaker in each room and having music follow you around? like when my wife's cleaning or something
[18:37:35] <JollyRgrs> again... i lose ZERO existing features, I only gain features

[18:37:45] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: hold on, lemme find a link for you
[18:38:33] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, Ecobee sells smart sensors that sense motion and occupancy for better cooling and heating
[18:38:42] <thegodsquirrel> but you can also use them for automations

[18:49:13] <csws> Hi TopCrow 
[18:49:44] <int0x1C8> wasn't there some research a while ago about using MU-MIMO type wifi routers as radar?
[18:50:19] <int0x1C8> detecting locations and movement of individuals and such
[18:50:58] <TopCrow> This? https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8288677
[18:53:38] <int0x1C8> no that seems to be more about communication, I'm talking about a wifi router that can tell if you are in a certain room of the house or not, and when you enter or leave it, etc
[18:54:31] <technonerd> sudo cant fork, cuz fork you thats why

[18:58:25] <TopCrow> On a different subject recently failed a sysadmin interview so wandered if anyone here has a minute to help a noob with a question I didn't solve right and didn't get the correct answer later?
[18:58:35] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> just drop the q
[18:59:09] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> ^
[18:59:11] <int0x1C8> what's the question
[18:59:13] <TopCrow> Imagine a virtualised enviorment built on foss inteded to host a web app and databases with distributed storage, high availability and full redundancy.
[18:59:14] <TopCrow> The task is to list the components needed for such a system.
[18:59:42] <koollman> 1) you need one TopCrow . easy to answer. Would have got you hired, see ? ;)
[19:00:07] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> confidence is key
[19:00:29] *** Quits: interop_madness (~interop_m@user/interop-madness/x-0950004) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:00:32] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> that question really doesnt belong in a sysadmin interview
[19:00:32] <TopCrow> I can list what I got so far, but yeah I quickly realised knowing individual components and knowing all components needed was very different
[19:00:39] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> theres also many ways to skin a cat
[19:01:23] <TopCrow> Agreed but yeah, it had a lot of devops mixed in which I didn't know it would have beforehand
[19:01:41] <Oliber> i bought a bunch of wiz 4lite bulbs, i really should make my HA instance control them instead of their app
[19:01:43] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> thats a pretty shitty question to ask in an interview, doing something like that is its own job title
[19:02:02] <TopCrow> They gave me an example later with oVirt and glusterFS but doesn't mean much since I never used the sepcific platform
[19:02:03] <koollman> TopCrow: lets pepper some names around, though. high level view: some machines running linux, some virt system (based on xen or qemu, maybe helped by something like proxmox, cloudstack, openstack), some way to handle storage (drbd, ceph, glusterfs, ...), some tools around it to manage it
[19:02:18] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> and a sysadmin doesnt really need to be familiar with that stuff to the point they know a good stack to deploy, a sysadmin would know how to find a stack that works
[19:02:34] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> so my answer would be that i would research it lol
[19:02:54] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> google is the ultimate sysadmin tool
[19:02:56] <koollman> a​bakedapplepie: depends on the position. Maybe they wanted someone with some ideas about what exists, or why some things are useful
[19:03:22] <mistiry> two hypervisors in a cluster. load balancer in front of the web app with at least 2 nodes behind it. storage it depends how they do it, obviously build in HA at that layer for the disks and controllers. same for network layer and redundancy in the switches and cabling. multiple paths for each thing (more than one network link, more than one path to stroage, etc).
[19:03:26] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> a sysadmin should know the concepts and a high level of how they work but i wouldnt expect a sysadmin to name off a specific working stack to accomplish that exact goal
[19:03:27] <mistiry> but that is a terrible question
[19:03:41] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> thats a system engineer / designer / with some devops
[19:04:01] <koollman> TopCrow: and, if the tools used don't handle it, some way to manage your vm high-availability (proxmox uses corosync/pacemaker, other tools may have their own specific things, or you can build it around various existing tools)
[19:04:37] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> sounds like they either dont know what a sysadmin is, or they want an expert level jack of all trades
[19:04:50] <TopCrow> Maybe was just a way to weed out candidates idk, thanks 
[19:05:39] <koollman> a​bakedapplepie: most companies don't want a single restricted role, unless they have thousands of employees with the right skills for the right tasks already
[19:06:22] <koollman> if the team is tiny, someone has to know more than one trick :)
[19:07:30] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> a tiny team wanting to know how to deploy a highly available, fully redundant hypervisor solution with foss sounds... cheap
[19:07:40] <koollman> well... yeah
[19:08:22] <TopCrow> It's a bigger company but this was for a team whose seniors do a lot of project planning, that's maybe why?
[19:09:02] <koollman> (I mean, I did pretty much that exact kind of arch as part of two jobs, including current one. I know why it is done :) )
[19:09:05] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> yeah i mean those roles are perfectly fine and they exist i just wouldnt call that question suitable for a system admin
[19:09:16] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> thats a senior system engineer
[19:09:30] <TopCrow> Anyway thanks all this was what I got so far https://bin.nixnet.services/?298c963581021851#8XQS9D42SWVXYrBocjWmEZbDubjx49wRzAbpsT318cCS
[19:09:34] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> or maybe senior devops with some pm roles
[19:09:55] <TopCrow> A lot is probs beacuse well depends on what's hosted really
[19:10:12] <TopCrow> And for how much expected traffic
[19:10:19] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> with open source its a mixmatch of what works best for your environment
[19:10:24] <sd> 12<h​xcsp> lots of different solutions
[19:11:02] <koollman> TopCrow: I would say 'not centos', given current EOL for it. But, sure, seems like one way to make it work
[19:11:33] <koollman> the goal is probably not to design the perfect arch in a 5min questions, but to see if you have some ideas about how to attack the problem :)
[19:12:06] <TopCrow> I'm not a fan either of the new stream but the company uses it a lot so yeah it will get the job done
[19:12:26] <koollman> the, sure, in context, it makes sense :)
[19:12:32] <TopCrow> Yeah and I got overwhelemd XD  At least that's why I'm learnign now

[19:15:27] <TopCrow> Thanks for the encouragement
[19:15:29] <koollman> TopCrow: depends how precisely you want to explain it 
[19:16:56] <TopCrow> Well on the spot i would explain a bit deeper individual components,, in terms of missing components feel free to list some more I missed 
[19:17:05] <sd> 08<a​bakedapplepie> ugh centos
[19:17:50] <koollman> TopCrow: if you put them all in docker, maybe something to run it. At least docker-compose, maybe docker swarm or kubernetes or nomad (but that's another level of complexity added to the system)

[20:17:02] <A-KO> I told these people 10 fucking months ago they'd have a lot more problems with this project and they REALLY need to R&D shit before they commit to it. And instead they fucking promised the project to *executives*
[20:17:10] <A-KO> and their first fucking user of the project? a fucking IT executive.
[20:17:18] <A-KO> and every problem he has with it? "Oh go talk to those guys"
[20:17:19] <int0x1C8> but this is why it's great being brought in at this point, you can't, and shouldn't hide that passive aggression
[20:17:22] <A-KO> NO, MOTHERFUCKERS. OWN YOUR SHIT

[20:21:09] <A-KO> 10 months ago they decided they wanted to take the whole company "passwordless". Through yubikeys. A combination of FIDO2 and PIV depending on the piece needed. I said FIDO2 was too early to mass deploy to 10,000 fucking people. And I said PIV has had issues and they need to think about it before they roll it to people who have no fucking clue how tech works. They promised the execs 
[20:21:09] <A-KO> they could do it in 6 months. And when a new CISO started, they promised it to him in 30 days. And they made him the first user.
[20:21:21] <int0x1C8> constantly mentioning how all this was a bad idea, and you told them it would never work, and whatever they're trying to do won't work because of decisions you didn't make

[20:22:07] <A-KO> I will never forget I told this new CISO/VP in a meeting that I needed a few months to work through something and he said "You have 30 days"--and the other project is now 4 months passed that.

[20:22:29] <A-KO> NOW
[20:22:31] <A-KO> yesterday
[20:22:39] <A-KO> they admitted that they might not be able to sunset something I said we needed to migrate
[20:22:54] <A-KO> back when I said "hey we should migrate this" they said "oh, no, we're getting rid of it. That's going to be too burdensome to the users."
