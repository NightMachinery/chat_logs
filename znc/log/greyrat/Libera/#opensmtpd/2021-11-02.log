[22:08:14] <sdk_> Is my understanding correct, that the only header I can set as outcome of a filter is the junk header?
[22:08:48] <sdk_> I'm looking for a way to differentiate which filter has set the spam flag.

[22:09:27] <sdk_> The first I idea I had was to set a X-Spam-Reason: that could be set to dnsbl, rdns, fcrdns.
[22:09:45] <sdk_> But I don't think opensmtpd allows this kind of freedom.
[22:10:58] <sdk_> The next Idea would be to write a filter and run the filter after every filter that could send the spam header. Then check the header and add a reason header (if not present) based on the position it was invoked from.
[22:11:15] <sdk_> But before I hop trought loops, I wanted to ask here if my understanding is correct.

[22:15:01] <sdk_> (or I could use rspamd... I know)
[22:15:14] <sdk_> (or spamd)
[22:17:12] <sdk_> yeah, scratch my questions. smtpd is not made for antispam, that's what spamd is for. I'm going to use that.
