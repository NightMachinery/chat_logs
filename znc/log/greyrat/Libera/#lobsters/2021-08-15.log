[07:30:36] <thoye> I wish there were a search engine that only gave pages that date back to the 1990s. (not counting using the Internet Archive)
[07:30:56] <thoye> When I occasionally stumble upon an old page, I miss the old web.
[07:31:34] <thoye> Idiosyncratic pages people made about themselves and their interests...
[07:31:45] <manicennui> The lack of commercialism.
[07:36:27] <thoye> When I think of people making 1990s pages, I imagine them having a great time, as opposed to what I hear about it being a teen (especially the girls) having to present themselves as so put together at all times on social media. Just stress.

[10:20:39] <Church> Seems the next gen borrow checker for Rust uses prolog.
[10:21:55] <badtuple> It's not prolog directly, it's a custom made logic language for solving type and lifetime logic. Niko's blog series on it is absolutely fantastic. Like beautiful stuff for the vaugely curious.

[16:10:59] <amirouche> I spent three on my free time with python performance stuff (cpython / pypy / asyncio) I am done with that language
[16:11:12] <amirouche> and ecosystem.
[16:12:12] <amirouche> the silverlining is I have first hand view on how "python is slow". What remains true, is that you "hack" quickly a prototype.
[16:15:05] <bsandro> i resort to golang with that kind of stuff now to be honest
[16:15:31] <bsandro> can hack stuff quickly as well but it is magnitudes faster than any python implementation
[16:15:50] <river> yep!
[16:16:36] <amirouche> I do not want to enter the Goey wagon
[16:16:40] <amirouche> google I mean.
[16:17:35] <bsandro> it is not more google than protobuf for example
[16:17:43] <amirouche> The problem with python is not only performance, but like Scheme it is very fragmented, which means for me at least, I would need to retwrite a lot of stuff AND... dive into C / C++ code because GC complains for some reasons..
[16:18:26] <amirouche> e.g. I replaced asyncio eventloop with uvloop, the same program run 8h with asyncio, it crashed after 1min with uvloop =(
[16:18:27] <bsandro> ah yes, infamous _env folder and stuff
[16:19:13] <amirouche> I lost three month of my time instead of just listening to the elders.
[16:19:43] <bsandro> well I wouldn't call it "lost", you gained some insight and knowledge
[16:20:10] <amirouche> I have too much to knowledge, I can only use it on my free time. My collegue are fed up with me :|

[16:59:12] <rhn_mk1> Python's performance is OK if most of the time it's stuck on IO, and that's it I guess
[16:59:50] <rhn_mk1> although I would have never said that it's fragmented or you have to jump into C (unless number crunching). But I never tried async either
[17:03:22] <amirouche> those are for different reason, for asyncio you might want to use uvloop that is bindings of libuv written in c++
[17:04:10] <amirouche> like I said my program runs for 10h actually with asyncio from the stdlib

[18:39:45] <epilys> de gustibus non disputandum est
[18:39:49] <epilys> i wonder the same about lisp
[18:42:12] <amirouche> they are reasons for python popularity but they interesect slightly with software engineering per se. On a per project basis there might better tools, but overall because of the economy of knowledge, in particular the wealth of half-broken but also half-working libraries it is popular.
[18:42:53] <amirouche> epilys: which lisp?
[18:43:14] <Brekkjern> It's also the fact that in 90% of cases, performance isn't really all that important. Whatever you write only has to be faster than a human
[18:43:50] <Brekkjern> The fact that we are measuring things in requests per SECOND already means we're several orders of magnitude faster than a human is
[18:44:02] <epilys> amirouche, all of them
[18:44:05] <amirouche> performance is not just wall-clock time, there is memory matters and devops matters, e.g. having to test all libraries with pypy and cpython does not help.
[18:44:13] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: Yeah, I plan on getting one of the new ones soon
[18:44:29] <epilys> if you wanted performance then don't write python :p
[18:44:31] <amirouche> also, I almost never read anymore hardware cost more than engineering time for some reasons..
[18:44:43] <Brekkjern> amirouche: Only if you care about it being 100% correct and no faults are allowed
[18:45:00] <amirouche> Brekkjern: replying to what?
[18:45:02] <ngoldbaum> python is more often than not the second best choice for a wide variety of tasks
[18:45:16] <Brekkjern> amirouche: The testing and verification of all libraries etc
[18:45:22] <ngoldbaum> that’s a pretty powerful argument to use it in a wide variety of contexts across an organization

[18:48:50] <Brekkjern> amirouche: Never experienced that happening
[18:49:03] <amirouche> but tbh I could deploy both pypy and cpython but then that is what lisp does => fragmentation.

[22:17:26] <gerikson> my nephew (14) has been teaching himself javascript this summer
[22:17:50] <gerikson> "what lang do you use uncle?" "Perl" "WOW THAT'S OLD"
[22:18:06] <gerikson> "what IDE?" "Emacs" "THAT'S OLD TOO!!!!"
[22:18:20] <gerikson> in summary and conclusion - I feel old
[22:18:38] <epilys> hahaha
[22:18:55] <shapr> emacs was old when I started using it in 1999
[22:19:05] <shapr> turns out, I feel old too
[22:19:10] <epilys> gerikson, tell him javascript is from 95

[22:23:28] <tarzeau__> why does this old discussions always make me hear/think old=bad, which is often just not true, but sometimes it is

[22:24:27] <gerikson> haha
[22:24:36] <Arsen> that's often the implication
[22:25:06] <tarzeau__> but when it's about oldtimers or wine the implication is right
[22:25:44] <tarzeau__> gerikson: didn't ask "what your fav game?" "nethack"
