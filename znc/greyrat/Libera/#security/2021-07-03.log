[02:54:36] <Blondie101010> just got a really concerning notification in Windows after visiting a bad search result...  it said that "all your files are encrypted", giving two buttons: "scan" and "remove virus", but I obviously didn't click them
[02:54:58] <Blondie101010> I just ran 3 AV scans and nothing shows up so I guess that seems like their way to trick people
[02:55:12] <euouae> What's the page?
[02:55:20] <Blondie101010> it changed
[02:55:27] <euouae> What do you mean?
[02:55:35] <Blondie101010> http://highercaptcha-settle.com/
[02:55:47] <Blondie101010> it used to show a bunch of junk and now only 12
[02:55:55] <euouae> No what's the page that showed you that encrypted message?
[02:56:15] <Blondie101010> it was a notiification I got from Chrome in my system tray
[02:56:53] <euouae> ok I wouldn't worry about that it's a trick to get people to pay

[03:01:10] <euouae> that skull stuff is kinda popular in middle-east hacking groups
[03:02:03] <euouae> Blondie101010: I recommend you use HTTPS only (which wouldn't let you visit that web page)
[03:02:40] <euouae> and if you're extra paranoid (and you should be) disable javascript by default and only activate if the website looks like what you were looking for
[03:03:51] <circuitbone> https everywhere addon / plugin and a good blacklist
[03:04:30] <Blondie101010> no JS isn't an option, and HTTPS actually looks clean there
[03:04:42] <euouae> why is no JS not an option?
[03:04:48] <euouae> You can have a whitelist of websites where JS works
[03:04:48] <Blondie101010> I need it for work
[03:04:59] <Blondie101010> not a bad idea!
[03:04:59] <euouae> The point is that JS is disabled by default on new websites
[03:05:13] <euouae> the notification trick would never work without js
[03:05:20] <Blondie101010> indeed
[03:05:46] <Blondie101010> thanks for that good advice

[08:42:48] <KREYREN> thanks
[08:42:50] <Blondie101010> don't think they're involved in FOSS
[08:43:10] <KREYREN> Blondie101010, they ain't but have interest in it while not believing it can be used on for-profit model
[08:43:18] <Blondie101010> but who knows what they run?  it's *their* system
[08:43:37] <Blondie101010> you talked with the owner or what?
[08:44:06] <catbeard> i mean you could make your own replica of the software that is FOSS as an alternative, and charge/license for support or commercial hosting for it like everyone else
[08:44:29] <Blondie101010> apparently not what he's looking for

[08:45:56] <catbeard> for those that offer paid software

[08:46:17] <KREYREN> nah they hired him, then kicked them off for incompetence, he was pissed and told me everything bcs stupid

[08:46:21] <KREYREN> was my classmate "p
[08:46:56] <Blondie101010> you should try to get hired first, if you think you're qualified to help them
[08:47:10] <KREYREN> catbeard, making my own replica is in work on multiple service providers such as git.dotya.ml but this is different scope

[08:54:00] <catbeard> that almost sounds like extortion, nobody is going to pay you for 5 xss vuln reports via BTC, and nobody is going to respond to you if they don't know who you are, or what business you represent and why they need your service, what your goals are and why you contacted them in the first place
[08:54:35] <catbeard> if they can't afford to hire you in the first place, why even try?
[08:55:14] <Blondie101010> I can't make sense of that supposed philantropy
[08:55:50] <KREYREN> i use monero
[08:56:12] <KREYREN> catbeard, because i don't want to be hired.. i want them to use free software
[08:56:24] <Blondie101010> I don't care about the currency, as long as it has the proper value
[08:56:46] <catbeard> KREYREN: they apparently didn't go into business to offer free software, so you're not going to change their minds about that
[08:57:18] <Blondie101010> no, he says he wants to help them by having them use free software
[08:57:28] <Blondie101010> who could benefit from that honestly?
[08:57:30] <catbeard> why would they use your free software though when they get paid for having paid software
[08:57:36] <Blondie101010> it'll cost them a lot to change everything
[08:57:59] <KREYREN> catbeard, i changed people's mind before and i do that again
[08:58:01] <KREYREN> :knife:
[08:58:27] <KREYREN> business has no problem going free software if that makes them to make more money
[08:58:32] <catbeard> that may be the case, but in general i don't think that's likely to happen, paid software vendors make money off of the paid software they sell/maintain
[08:58:32] <Blondie101010> the free software foundation certainly won't benefit from having a new user

[08:59:02] <catbeard> so the idea of making it open source isn't always viable, say for example they are IPO
[08:59:14] <catbeard> or publicly traded
[08:59:15] <Blondie101010> so far the only person who might benefit from it is KREYREN
[08:59:21] <catbeard> exactly
[08:59:28] <KREYREN> catbeard, yes which is why making amazon 200+ employees to be paying members of gitpod.io made them to go free software

[09:00:09] <catbeard> your proposal for them to use your free software loses them money from their paying clients, in order to pay you less and make nothing on your free software that probably doesn't do what _THEY_ want
[09:00:20] <KREYREN> nah
[09:00:20] <Blondie101010> if 200 people offer to pay me to change something, it might be worth considering

[09:00:32] <KREYREN> now me back work
[09:00:36] <thecloud1> are there any anonymity VPN providers who abide by FOSS principles?
[09:00:41] <catbeard> or for them to start offering free software would kill their business model
[09:00:54] <catbeard> some providers have community editions that are free but not FOSS
[09:01:28] <KREYREN> thecloud1, thegood.cloud for example
[09:01:36] <KREYREN> ah VPN
[09:01:37] <KREYREN> x.x
[09:01:48] <Blondie101010> another way KREYREN could possibly benefit from such a situation is that by getting more users on the FOSS systems he uses, it would allow them to be better maintained

[10:38:14] <Blondie101010> didn't dig in his link details, but they all refered to commercial services
[10:39:31] <mats1> openvpn is mentioned in the dictionary under the entry, 'open sores'
[10:39:54] <Blondie101010> openvpn is fine
[10:40:03] <mats1> try reading it and get back to me
[10:40:16] <Blondie101010> do you have a link?

[17:16:53] <fnk> hi
[17:18:08] <soulisson> fnk, how are you?
[17:18:34] <fnk> soulisson: great:) and you?
[17:18:42] <fnk> i believe i should get more sleep though
[17:19:10] <tetrapod> Hey can I run something by you? Is it secure to send a username+password trough HTTP url parameters over tls?
[17:19:22] <soulisson> fnk, doing ok. Struggling with a simple kali installation. I think there is some speed performance issue on my laptop.
[17:19:42] <soulisson> fnk, :) I lack of sleep as well.
[17:20:07] <fnk> tetrapod: it's not a good idea to send passwords in the url, because it usually means it's being logged somewhere
[17:20:10] <soulisson> tetrapod, it's preferrable not to.
[17:20:15] <tetrapod> I'm signing up for a service and that's how they authenticate their API requests. I'm just wondering if I should just raise an eyebrow and continue, or find something else.
[17:20:41] *** Joins: KidBeta (~KidBeta@user/kidbeta)
[17:21:10] <tetrapod> Is the url at least encrypted on https? Idk tbh.
[17:21:28] <soulisson> tetrapod, there are several issues. Over the shoulder surfing, and get requests are logged on the server and in intermediate proxies
[17:22:06] <fnk> soulisson: if it's https then is a little bit more secure, as the URI part would be sent after the secure connection has been established, but still not the best idea
[17:22:20] <soulisson> tetrapod, yes, unless you used http and got redirected to https but otherwise, yes.

[17:25:51] <tetrapod> soulisson so how do proxies log these parameters if they're encrypted?
[17:26:08] <soulisson> I don't know what to do tbh.  I spent so much time on it. I don't know if I should reboot
[17:26:46] <uoj6wz6qoswb> the client doesnt send user:pass@my.site it takes those values and inserts them into http headers the proxy if its clear text would get all post data for external authentication regardless
[17:26:50] <soulisson> tetrapod, in some environments things are configured so proxied can get your requests.
[17:26:54] <uoj6wz6qoswb> so its not really related to basic auth as a thing
[17:27:21] <uoj6wz6qoswb> if you use any auth over cleartext its broken
[17:27:45] <uoj6wz6qoswb> but the implementation is just how you pass the data to the client the backend is all http headers its not actually sent over the network in the domain
[17:27:56] <tetrapod> No it's https. It's like api.php?user=x&pass=y&passmorestuffhere
[17:29:42] <fnk> doesn't look good
[17:29:47] <soulisson> tetrapod, if you used burp proxy. It's basically the same idea :)
[17:29:53] <uoj6wz6qoswb> yeh thats going to be stamped all over log files forms normally use post data because reading dev/stdin isnt logged
