[17:20:47] <step21> hey. I have a boxshadow that is still visible when the element (main body) scrolls below the header. Is it possible to show the shadow only where the main element is visible? I wanted to avoid making the header wider, guess that would cover it up too
[17:23:18] <hassoon> step21: make us a fiddle in which you reproduce the issue
[17:23:23] <hassoon> step21: always do so
[17:24:15] <step21> ok. didn't think about fiddle and cannot link to live version atm
[17:29:49] <hassoon> step21: no, you ca
[17:29:53] <hassoon> * you can.
[17:30:38] <step21> hassoon I meant I am not sure if I am allowed to. Fiddle is easier so thanks for pointing that out
[17:37:15] <step21> hassoon this should showcase it https://jsfiddle.net/step21/4jv7rkba/1/
[17:37:58] <step21> not as well, because the shadow is on the side, but basically when scrolling it stays visible, while the scrolled content is not. which looks weird :)

[18:00:11] <kome> hi
[18:01:41] <kome> I would need some help with my website, https://mrtno.com/CV.html
[18:02:24] <kome> i like how it looks on a real browser, but on mobile i would like a bigger zoom
[18:02:32] <hassoon> step21: just come here and reproduce your example https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/
[18:02:50] <kome> can this problem be solved with Viewport? and if yes, how?
[18:03:39] <Minall> Nice website btw kome
[18:04:08] <kome> Minall: you are so kind, thanks!
[18:04:38] <kome> it's a design i set in 2012 or 2013, and never updated since...
[18:05:27] <kome> at the time i didn't care too much about mobile, but now i'm convinced it's not a fad :P
[18:06:34] <kome> do you have idea about how to "zoom it" on mobile?
[18:08:23] <Minall> kome I see it classic and very pleasant to read... By zoom it you mean a bigger font?
[18:09:15] <step21> hassoon does this https://jsfiddle.net/step21/4jv7rkba/1/ not work?
[18:09:37] <kome> Minall: when i open it on a cellphone or on a tablet, there is a big empty margin on the right... this behaviour is ok on a desktop, but on a tablet it would be better to have a bigger zoom to make it readable
[18:09:57] <kome> i read something about Viewport
[18:10:09] <kome> but i'm not sure it would be the right solution
[18:10:11] <step21> kome make a media query to not make that margin below 700 px or so
[18:10:15] <step21> (as example)
[18:10:34] <kome> hmm how?
[18:11:21] <Minall> You could also use Flex grow but, bear with step21
[18:11:41] <step21> kome such as @media screen and (max-width: 700px) { }
[18:11:51] <Minall> kome media query, below 700px, no margin, perhaps you can put it on jsfiddle?
[18:11:52] <step21> in the css
[18:12:07] <step21> then between the curly brackets what you want different
[18:12:07] <kome> step21: thank you, i'm trying that!
[18:12:13] *** Joins: moldorcoder7 (~moldorcod@37.120.143.28)
[18:12:15] <Minall> step21 In that media query you can put any css to fix your page
[18:13:00] <moldorcoder7> is it possibel in scss or whatever to have the 2 in calc(100% / 2) being a variable somehow that is define in a data attribute or such
[18:14:03] <Minall> moldorcoder7 Like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17982111/sass-variable-in-css-calc-function?
[18:14:15] <kome> step21: but in the curly brackets, what would i need to specify? like, is there a css function to suggest to the client to zoom the page somehow?
[18:14:49] <moldorcoder7> Minall, ewxactly like that , could have search better
[18:14:55] <moldorcoder7> thanks
[18:15:06] <step21> no. in the css, there prob is a margin on the right.  set that to zero or to less
[18:15:45] <kome> hmm
[18:16:47] <Minall> moldorcoder7 Just search sass calc variable, and that came up
[18:18:32] <step21> or afaik you don't have margin but width: 510 px
[18:18:42] <step21> so that's prob why
[18:18:56] <step21> but also the style is minified so quite annoying to read
[18:19:23] <step21> if you put it into. sth like jsfiddle.net, it's easier to check
[18:21:24] <hassoon> step21: i'm seeing a gray shadow on #main, now what ?
[18:21:58] <step21> hassoon yes. that's supposed to be there. but when you scroll down, this scrolls past the header
[18:22:06] <step21> which I don't like
[18:23:00] <step21> the header is the same width as the main part, so it doesn't cover the shadow unfortunately
[18:23:10] <hassoon> step21: when the user scrolls down enough that the header hides upward, you want the shadow to disappear ?
[18:23:16] <step21> yes
[18:23:21] <step21> well, not fully
[18:23:38] <step21> only the part where the main part is not visible
[18:23:47] <kome> step21: https://jsfiddle.net/z1h7k0dq/
[18:24:25] <hassoon> step21: you mean you want the shadow to disappear in the initial spot of the header ?
[18:24:49] <hassoon> step21: ah i see
[18:25:44] <step21> kome yeah it's because width of box2
[18:25:55] <step21> as far as I can tell
[18:26:34] <step21> but you should also think about using relative measurements. such as em or vh (em is relative to line height iirc) as these scale better
[18:27:46] <kome> hmm, i'm confused
[18:28:43] <kome> but i fear that if u use relative stuff, the sit would get too big on a normal browser
[18:28:57] <kome> and i like that on a small screen box2 fall below
[18:30:11] <hassoon> step21: https://jsfiddle.net/hassoon/mhrq5w0x/2/
[18:30:20] <hassoon> step21: my corrections are in the lowest part of the css section
[18:30:37] <step21> kome well, you use both relative and the media query above
[18:31:32] <step21> hassoon cool, thanks

[19:01:14] <hassoon> moldorcoder7: what have you got ?
[19:02:19] <moldorcoder7> hassoon, on an existing project i added @angular/material a while ago and now trying to edit the main them with a custom scss , but all the core functions are not exiusting like mat-palette, mat-color
[19:02:27] <moldorcoder7> i have unknow function on all of them
[19:02:39] <moldorcoder7> with just a copy paste of this basically
[19:02:40] <moldorcoder7> https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-t1k1x6?file=theme.scss
[19:02:47] <moldorcoder7> while on a new project it works
[19:03:07] <moldorcoder7> looks like custom-theme choise when adding material doesnt define the function mapping from config.js ..
[19:03:12] <moldorcoder7> but cant find how to fix that
[19:06:31] <hassoon> ah you got a stackblitz fiddle ?
[19:06:32] <hassoon> lemme see
[19:08:07] <hassoon> moldorcoder7: where is this unknow function error ?
[19:08:22] <moldorcoder7> on mat-palette , mat-color , ... but here locally
[19:09:09] <moldorcoder7> hassoon, i think it is because even with a custom theme, i have to import a theme from material : @import '~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css';
[19:09:11] <moldorcoder7> liek this
[19:10:35] <hassoon> moldorcoder7: you got your project on git? maybe i can run it in my machine
[19:11:04] <moldorcoder7> hassoon, i have to code on another computer even then the one where i chart cause of co policy :(
[19:12:31] <moldorcoder7> hassoon, thats the error : https://ibb.co/H4cS6XP
[19:15:38] <hassoon> moldorcoder7: tried this ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62715234/how-should-i-apply-a-custom-angular-material-theme
[19:16:46] <moldorcoder7> hassoon, i think it is something specific for angular 12 where those functions have been deprecated
[19:16:54] <moldorcoder7> there is an upgrade kind of mapping in this file : node_modules/@angular/material/schematics/ng-update/migrations/theming-api-v12/config.js
[19:17:04] <moldorcoder7> that provide old / new function
[19:17:09] <hassoon> moldorcoder7: is that angular material UI library supported in angular 12 ?
[19:17:14] <moldorcoder7> like mat-palette -> mat.define-palette ...
[19:17:20] <moldorcoder7> yes it is the core one
[19:18:51] <hassoon> moldorcoder7: what about your package.json ? i can use it to reproduce your project in my machine
[19:19:03] <hassoon> you can pastebin it or something
[19:19:37] <moldorcoder7> hassoon, i prefer not  but i found out how to fix it , for each function i do : grep -Ri mat-color | grep config.js
[19:19:42] <moldorcoder7> and then get the new function name
