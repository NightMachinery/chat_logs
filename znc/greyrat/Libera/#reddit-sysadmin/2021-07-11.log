[00:59:58] <Sousapro> dragonfleas: the easy answer is that they didn't do a 1:1 replacement for the MCSA/MCSE exams. you'll want to dig into hunterkll's links and wrap your head around it

[01:08:42] <sd> 06<d​onron> I just dont know where actually. I hate LANCOM
[01:08:43] <dragonfleas> yeah i guess they don't certify you on OS stuff anymore beyond an MTA

[01:09:22] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> there is no server-only cert anymore

[01:09:45] <dragonfleas> yeahhh
[01:09:56] <dragonfleas> i'm guessing this is a 'yet' thing
[01:10:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> pretty simple to get if you read that cert bootcamp link
[01:10:00] <dragonfleas> and they'll eventually implement those
[01:10:16] <Sousapro> donron: check your split tunnel configuration in your VPN appliance and make sure that subnet is allowed for the role you're connected as

[01:26:31] <Sousapro> have they considered finishing what they started for once? lol
[01:26:53] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> we switched to brocade for everything for the first split because he had a personal vendetta against cisco .... and he only has like, CCNA certs
[01:27:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> how he became the lead network architect no one has any clue
[01:27:08] <Sousapro> blackmail
[01:27:09] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> my guess was blowjobs
[01:27:15] <Sousapro> that works too 
[01:27:23] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> we had tons of new in box cisco hardware
[01:27:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that we just dispo'd or let sit doing nothing
[01:27:48] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and went from a full cisco shop - anyconnect to core routers, the whole nine yards, to brocade and ..... what was it, aruba for wifi and VPN?
[01:27:54] <Sousapro> that guy sounds like senior leadership material
[01:27:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and palo for firewalls?
[01:28:01] <Sousapro> jesus
[01:28:03] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it was a wild mess
[01:28:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> *he only had cisco certS*
[01:28:26] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> The main reason behind this? His personal vendetta?
[01:28:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> He was on a contract, and cisco went around us and sold direct to the customer instead of through them
[01:28:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's it
[01:28:48] <Sousapro> ...
[01:28:48] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's the only reason for the whole damn fiasco
[01:29:02] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> 😄
[01:29:15] <Sousapro> that's insanely petty lol
[01:29:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and we were nearing the point of everyone on the new network, the old networks both sides of the previous merger/acquisitoin considered legacy and slowly being torn down, etc
[01:29:50] <Sousapro> even if you don't like it, phase it out intelligently. don't just commit full network architect
[01:29:51] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> then we got bought out
[01:30:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Sousapro: we actually had a prime opportunity to do half the core systems at once - a holiday weekend datacenter move
[01:30:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so if it was going to happen, that was a prime opportunity to do it
[01:30:38] <Sousapro> let me guess, einstein objected?

[01:30:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> no no
[01:30:47] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's when we did it
[01:30:59] <Sousapro> how'd it go?
[01:31:00] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> when we were installing all the new shit, throwing in brocades instead of the "old" nexus fex's
[01:31:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> not terribly, until microsoft TMG came into the picture
[01:31:29] <Sousapro> that's like using the konami code
[01:31:31] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> for the most part it was run over, tell a network guy what port was fuckery, get it fixed, etc.... we got it all done in time
[01:31:45] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> TMG was the last holdout on a standalone VMware host though
[01:31:54] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> because it transmits on one MAC address, and receives on another
[01:32:01] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but that second one never *ever* speaks
[01:32:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so you have to do a static MAC entry on the switch
[01:32:15] <Sousapro> why do we always have to tell tenured network engineers literally everything but the commands on their switches/routing stacks?
[01:32:17] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> simple enough? Right?
[01:32:25] <Sousapro> should be
[01:32:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but him and A-KO almost got into blows, while A-KO's holding up his laptop with the brocade and microsoft doc, while this dickhead is screaming THAT'S NOT HOW NETWORKING WORKS

[01:32:57] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> our current group, especially their top level manager, is no nonsense

[01:33:07] <Sousapro> that's awesome
[01:33:12] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> we were trying to get them to set up a fuckin virtual ASA for pre-logon mac VPN testing

[01:33:43] <Sousapro> I had to do the full datacenter network design including hardware, subnet layout, physical locations, network pulls several times
[01:33:54] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> like, our needs were literally : a vASA on a host, with external accessibility, in a subnet, that we can use

[01:33:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lol
[01:33:57] <Sousapro> and got angry enough that I learned enough juniper syntax to call BS
[01:34:32] <Sousapro> oh yeah and wireless system and network drop planning
[01:35:01] <Sousapro> the network engineering team let it set until 91 days out and then I told them that they were out lol
[01:35:11] <Sousapro> they did this on three new sites
[01:35:37] <Sousapro> they needed approach radar and ATC to find their heads lol
[01:36:18] <Sousapro> hunterkll: lol that shouldn't take that much effort
