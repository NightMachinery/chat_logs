[06:39:11] <EvanR> after a lot of refactoring my physics are working again, and it's probably better. But now I have this thing at the heart of the physics decision loop. It basically takes a time limit, a bunch of hits against normal geometry (Elems) and hits at abnormal microsites, and must pick the earliest (within limit)
[06:39:32] <EvanR> and microsites have to win ties, since that is where Elem results are unreliable
[06:39:47] <EvanR> so I used a datatype with an Ord instance...
[06:40:02] <EvanR> I feel like it could be cleaner but I am so done with this part!
[06:40:08] <EvanR> https://paste.tomsmeding.com/EbQhUoNk
[06:41:06] <EvanR> well, after removing the Env which isn't used
[06:42:36] <sm> you need more AI in there
[06:46:26] <EvanR> the next missing piece is code that will yield elements and microsites from the abstract level
[06:49:21] <EvanR> but I need to take a F-ing break and go see the new spiderman
[07:22:02] <sm> new spiderman you say
[07:22:06] <sm> good work EvanR 
[10:38:24] <EvanR> dang... that was a long movie

[14:00:32] <f-a> I recall one from , uhh 20 years ago?
[14:00:50] <f-a> lots of emotional manipulation and creative ways to show some nudity 
[14:07:55] <ManofLetters[m]> are spiders insects? Insectman!

[22:02:58] <EvanR> no not technically
[22:12:17] <icrbow[m]> insects are 6-legged
[22:15:44] <ManofLetters[m]> right, I didn't count his legs correctly
[22:20:38] <EvanR> which terminal irc client does anyone list
[22:20:43] <EvanR> er, like
[22:21:25] <ManofLetters[m]> before I switched to Matrix, I used irssi
[22:21:34] <f-a> irssi
[22:21:47] <__monty__> Irssi's still serving me fine. Matrix is painful though.
[22:22:09] <EvanR> irssi is still kind it seems
[22:22:14] <EvanR> ... king
[22:22:32] <f-a> some people like weechat
[22:22:39] <EvanR> haven't seen anyone on bitchx (advertising at least) in a while
[22:22:39] <__monty__> If you feel like hacking on your IRC client glirc is written in haskell : ) Some people consider Weechat an Irssi with better defaults.
[22:23:03] <EvanR> glirc looked interesting but then I got caught up trying to compile it
[22:23:40] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm sure emacs has a client, too
[22:24:02] <ManofLetters[m]> with today's several GB RAM that can be devoted to emacs alone, this can work
[22:25:15] <__monty__> Yeah, ERC was fine. Heard Circe should be even better.
[22:26:13] <EvanR> mud clients use some form of telnet right. Anyone seen a mud with a custom terminal client?
[22:26:40] <EvanR> obviously plenty of proprietary graphical ones
[22:27:06] <EvanR> by custom I mean, doesn't even use telnet
[22:37:13] <sm> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellgamedev/comments/rljbbs/game/
[22:42:02] <EvanR> I'm often confused by reddit links. This person is looking for a game engine?
[22:42:45] <sm> " I would like to make a small game with graphics. Would you recommend a stable game engine for it?"
[22:43:03] <sm> I parsed it, but I have lots of practice parsing internet speak :)
[22:43:50] <sm> I didn't fall for the "would you recommend..." "Yes I would!"
[22:44:14] <EvanR> they are on an admirable quest
[22:44:44] <sm> what other actually ready to use game engines have we ? I exclude ansi-terminal-game because they said graphics
[22:45:12] <sm> I guess sdl2 
[22:49:25] <EvanR> not really a game engine
[22:50:45] <sm> doesn't it have a game loop ?
[22:50:50] <EvanR> no
[22:51:00] <EvanR> bring your own game loop
[22:51:03] <sm> huh
[22:51:34] <EvanR> it has a tick counting thing, it has event poll, it has render present
[22:52:04] <sm> it's pretty close to a game engine. Kind of surprising they don't include a little starter game loop
[22:52:23] <EvanR> it's about 5 feet from just having a blank C file xD
[22:52:31] <ManofLetters[m]> bindings to Godot
[22:52:54] <EvanR> godot from a foreign language... 
[22:53:03] <EvanR> does the IDE even work in that case
[22:53:11] <ManofLetters[m]> no idea
[22:53:22] <sm> I haven't seen any haskell game using godot yet
[22:53:42] <EvanR> the bindings hypothetically exist but godot's not geared for that kind of workflow
[22:53:49] <sm> aha: https://github.com/SimulaVR/godot-haskell/tree/master/examples
[22:53:50] <ManofLetters[m]> people over on the Discord did at least one for a jam
[22:54:15] <sm> but no screenshots so I don't believe in it
[22:54:44] <sm> where's the discord Man of Letters ? How many chatters there ?
[22:56:10] <EvanR> https://discord.gg/qG333q3b
[22:56:33] <ManofLetters[m]> https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack/blob/master/README.md
[22:56:37] <ManofLetters[m]> chatters and link
[22:56:50] <sm> thanks. 182, 62 online
[22:57:11] * ManofLetters[m] uploaded a video: (1484KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/mozilla.org/f5f665feb8ec3308825a25cb90656ef185fad76f/2021-10-12_21-14-37.mov >
[22:57:13] <ManofLetters[m]> and a screenshot from there
[22:57:19] <sm> is that the link you meant Man of Letters ?
[22:57:26] <ManofLetters[m]> yes
[22:57:40] <sm> no mention of discord or chat there
[22:58:07] <ManofLetters[m]> dont' you see the button "chat on Discord"?
[22:58:23] <ManofLetters[m]> at the very top
[22:58:28] <sm> now I see the tiny graphical button, yes thank you
[22:58:37] <ManofLetters[m]> you are welcome :)
[22:58:51] <ManofLetters[m]> the screenshot is from #boast-updates from there
[22:58:54] <ManofLetters[m]> in Godot
[22:59:11] <ManofLetters[m]> I think it's WIP screenshot
[22:59:18] <sm> so it's a general Haskell GameDev chat. Good to see it's active too. I think you considered bridging it once ?
[22:59:20] <ManofLetters[m]> but the guys finished it, I think
[22:59:50] <ManofLetters[m]> yes, so far only LambdaHack room is bridged, but we considered bridging also #general
[22:59:53] <sm> (video looks great!)
[22:59:56] <ManofLetters[m]> but there is many other rooms...
[23:00:10] <sm> is it bigger/more active than here, then ?
[23:00:16] <EvanR> we must be talking about different discords
[23:00:23] <ManofLetters[m]> it's much bigger and usually much less active :)
[23:00:23] <EvanR> there's no lambdahack room
[23:00:45] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, nothing at the bottom?
[23:01:01] <EvanR> oh dang there it is
[23:01:03] <ManofLetters[m]> the name of the server is Haskell Gamedev
[23:01:07] <EvanR> the universe unsplit
[23:01:17] <ManofLetters[m]> :D
[23:17:37] <sm> wow yes, congrats on Haskell GameDev growth
[23:18:23] <sm> direct bridging might be too much, but ideally we'd have some kind of periodic post that bridges them (announcing news from both)
[23:18:37] <sm> This Week In Haskell Gamedev
[23:19:11] <sm> though we're not really at Weekly activity yet
[23:19:13] <EvanR> crossing the chat streams seems like... no substitute for a popular blog
[23:19:38] <ManofLetters[m]> I think people here and there are mostly just chatting idly or brainstorming specific things together; neither seems very newsworthy
[23:20:04] <sm> yup. Maybe later
[23:20:22] <ManofLetters[m]> perhaps reddits is a good place for announcements from both communities?
[23:20:27] <sm> still, even a monthly repost of "haskell gamedev faq" with links so people can discover the other places
[23:20:31] <ManofLetters[m]> s/reddits/reddit/haskellgamedev/
[23:20:42] <ManofLetters[m]> yes, that'd be good
[23:20:42] <sm> yes probably that's a good idea
[23:21:01] <sm> since we don't have a mail list and people don't use those these days
[23:21:06] <ManofLetters[m]> and mothly Haskell Gamedev FAQ there would be great
[23:21:27] <sm> and/or monthly comment / pinned comment in the main chats
[23:21:31] <ManofLetters[m]> *monthly; advertised elewhere, too
[23:23:09] <sm> if we had a fast and complete home page, ideally including a blog aggregator, that'd be a help too
[23:24:50] <sm> https://haskell-game.dev works better in brave btw, no CSS pop. Quite ugly in safari though.
[23:25:59] <sm> ic.rbow: I think it's the download of MavenPro-VariableFont_wght.ttf that causes the delay. 
[23:26:06] * sm uploaded an image: (74KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/VEMHGSqpxzDdAJXeIkJytbwm/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-21%20at%209.55.57%20AM.png >
[23:26:29] <sm> it's not caching I think
[23:28:03] <EvanR> slick web design of the sort created by *those passionate about web tech* is what separates baby scenes from the mature scenes
[23:29:56] <sm> (it looks better without the custom font, here)
[23:30:38] <sm> if/when this site had to move on from emanote, is it easy to migrate content ? Just markdown files ?
[23:31:16] <sm> is the content repo public ?
