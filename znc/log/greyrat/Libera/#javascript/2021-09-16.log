[00:06:42] <merpnderp> But why would \& break json.parse?
[00:07:15] <thykka> are you trying to replace all occurrences, or just the first?
[00:07:24] <ljharb> merpnderp: because that's not a valid json escape?
[00:07:35] <ljharb> merpnderp: json needs `\\` if you want an actual backslash to go in
[00:07:44] <ljharb> merpnderp: and that means you might need `.replace('&', '\\\\&')`
[00:07:56] <ljharb> merpnderp: but you shouldn't be manually doing ANYTHING with json strings
[00:08:01] <ljharb> merpnderp: parse it first, and then transform the JS object.
[00:08:28] <merpnderp> You beautiful genius
[00:08:46] <merpnderp> Wait what?
[00:08:57] <merpnderp> I shouldn't do anything with json strings?
[00:09:13] <merpnderp> But that's a giant convoluted POS object some dev created that's fun of a dozen different things.
[00:09:42] <merpnderp> If I wait until its an object, I'll have to track down every property to find every string which could possibly contain user entered data with bad characters.
[00:09:55] <merpnderp> As a string, I can do it all at once.
[00:10:29] <merpnderp> This is one of my least favorite tasks. Turning a massive latex doc into an EJS template so that we can create PDF's.
[00:10:44] <ljharb> merpnderp: that doesn't mean you should

[00:11:25] <merpnderp> How is the source broke? It was designed to be displayed in the web.
[00:11:36] <merpnderp> The web can handle & and $ in strings.
[00:11:43] <merpnderp> This new LATEX requirement is new.
[00:12:47] <ljharb> ok

[00:17:42] <ljharb> lol you literally just said "I had originally used a regex which would have replaced all." and that's why you used a string
[00:17:46] <ljharb> you can use a regex and get it to just replace one.
[00:17:51] <ljharb> by not providing the `g` flag to the regex.
[00:18:03] <James0r> anyway, trying to understand why when i output (e.target) i get the element printed to the console, but if i output ('Element: ' + e.target) i instead get the href path to the console on focus event
[00:18:08] <merpnderp> Yeah, I switched to a string just because I couldn't figure out what was broken.

[02:08:56] <cantelope> oh
[02:09:01] <ljharb> sheetjs: i'm pretty confident that's not accurate
[02:09:04] <ThePendulum> ljharb: on our site it's to slow down spammers from writing bots, according to the CTO it does help to some extent
[02:09:23] <ljharb> ThePendulum: there's probably better ways to do that tho
[02:09:25] <ThePendulum> apparently not many of our spammers know you can just write JS to interface with the UI superficially
[02:09:36] <ljharb> sheetjs: either way basic minification is probably sufficient
[02:09:41] <ThePendulum> no need to know what's happening under the hood, just type in the input and click the button

[02:11:09] <ThePendulum> ljharb: I've voiced my skepticism from the start, especially since we're losing users on performance issues we can't replicate in dev, and on prod we get the double whammy: the obfuscation makes it worse, and nearly impossible to debug
[02:11:36] <ThePendulum> but he's been tackling spam on these sites much longer than I have, so wdik

[02:13:50] <ThePendulum> n> new RegExp(atob(btoa('something')), 'g')
[02:13:51] <jellobot> (okay) /something/g
[02:14:01] <kill> ThePendulum how can i use that?
[02:14:26] <kill> will this search replace the whole html?
[02:14:27] <ThePendulum> .replace(new RegExp(), '')
[02:14:34] <kill> let me try
[02:14:48] <z1haze> ThePendulum, sorry i stepped out. I guess there is no particular reason that its a background other than the background is for an full section of the site, and easily applied with a css class. The fiddle is just a rough mockup of how the actual site is done, but this demonstrates the issue
[02:14:55] <ThePendulum> well idk what exactly you want, all that does is allow you to use a variable string as a regular expression
[02:15:16] <ThePendulum> z1haze: alright, well I hope one of the suggestions works for you, let me know if there's something else
[02:15:53] <z1haze> So the main background should be at the bottom, the second image should be under the first image, but on top of the background Cutting off is not the goat, the bottom image is an 'emitting light' that should just flow out, but not interfere. I wonder if i turn pointer-events off if that might resolve it

[02:16:31] <kill> ThePendulum, thanks a lot dude, sorry to take so long to try
[02:17:01] <ThePendulum> np, hope you can use it to do what you're after, just replace the btoa() stuff with the source of your obfuscated string
[02:17:13] <ThePendulum> and again re-evaluate if you really want obfuscation here

[02:18:47] <z1haze> point-events: none actually took care of it. I still wish i understood why i couldnt get it working correctly. just something about that combination of relative positioning and z-indexing wasnt working
[02:18:50] <ThePendulum> z1haze: that's a bit hacky, sorry I still don't quite get where the button should appear relative to the background of the images
[02:19:06] <ThePendulum> should the image glow appear behind the button?
[02:19:30] <ThePendulum> as in, having the glow start below the button is not an option, it definitely needs to radiate under it?
[02:19:34] <z1haze> the image should glow behind the other image
[02:19:48] <z1haze> the glow and the button arent the issue
[02:19:52] <z1haze> persay, anyway
[02:20:29] <z1haze> the issue is that the glow is emitting out from under the image above it, but its resulting in covering anything it touches. I dont think that pointer events is a hack at all for this

[02:32:08] <ThePendulum> if you don't want to create a margin between the button and the glow but you don't want the glow to overlap the button either, I think I'd set a z-index on the button. not sure if you're trying to have multiple images with their glow overlapping but not on top of the main image

[07:42:15] <ljharb> and have you watched them and you know you don't?

[07:48:50] <Rockwood> is rain man any movie?
[07:49:06] <ljharb> Rockwood: yes, a very famous one

[07:50:42] <Slade> ljharb, no. i didnt like space cowboys. but the AI didnt claim I liked it.  its a going to space movie, so i kinda had to watch it
[07:50:52] <ljharb> Rockwood: any chance that when you're not watching tv at night, you're drinking
[07:51:17] <ljharb> Slade: on the list of "going to space movies", in priority order by quality, i'd bet money you haven't exhausted the options ranked higher than space cowboys
[07:51:46] <Slade> ljharb, higher ranked, and available free on netflix?
[07:52:23] <ljharb> Slade: i'd not be as fast to bet money, but i'd still be pretty confident
[07:52:33] <Rockwood> ljharb, i can watch but only newz and at night newz not make sense to me
[07:52:41] <ljharb> Slade: also there's a lot of great space tv shows on netflix that should be seen before space cowboys :-p
[07:52:48] <ljharb> Rockwood: then get a tv

[23:31:28] <goddard> i really only care about time
[23:32:00] <sheetjs> there are a few moving parts
[23:32:17] <sheetjs> if you know the timezone offset, you can just shift by that number of seconsd
[23:32:22] <sheetjs> n> new Date()
[23:32:23] <jellobot> (okay) 2021-09-16T19:02:22.899Z
[23:32:37] <goddard> yeah thats what i was thinking
[23:32:50] <goddard> timezone offset would work well
[23:32:57] <sheetjs> currently PST is -8
[23:33:50] <sheetjs> *PDT is -7
[23:33:57] <sheetjs> you can't see it from the bot, but if you run new Date().getTimezoneOffset() from America/Los_Angeles it will return 420
[23:34:03] <sheetjs> n> new Date().getTimezoneOffset()
[23:34:04] <jellobot> (okay) 0
[23:34:19] <sheetjs> in America/New_York it is 240 corresponding to -4
[23:35:01] <sheetjs> the moment-timezone library basically ships with timezone data to facilitate this calculation
