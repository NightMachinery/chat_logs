[00:13:18] <edgar-rft> before the 1980s the world had only two diumensions
[00:29:30] <selwyn> what topology did it have
[00:29:44] <selwyn> this is the real question
[00:37:17] <edgar-rft> it was a 3x3 grid of 9 virtual desktops, ask shka for details :-)
[00:37:58] <shka> selwyn: all-things-go-to-shit topology
[00:38:01] <shka> as always
[00:39:16] <gilberth> Heh, the German version of that wiki page about mobile phones says: "In Schweden sind daneben umgangssprachlich auch Ficktelefon [...] zu hören." lol
[00:39:41] <edgar-rft> The 9 virtual desktops were named Ásgarðr, Vanaheimr, Álfheimr, Miðgarðr, Jötunheimr, Múspellsheimr, Svartálfaheimr, Niflheimr, and Niðavellir :-)
[00:39:56] <selwyn> hm
[00:40:04] <gilberth> That would be fuckphone in English. Gosh!
[00:40:22] <gilberth> edgar-rft: You name your desktops?
[00:40:49] <shka> edgar-rft: well, they are named one, two, three, four, five and so one, but i may reconsider changing it now
[00:40:53] <selwyn> i wonder what the flat earthers opinion on topology is
[00:41:19] <edgar-rft> gilberth:  I'm talking to *all* things around me :-)
[00:41:44] <gilberth> edgar-rft: And everything has a unique name?
[00:42:24] <gilberth> selwyn: Well, flat?
[00:42:40] * selwyn maths noises
[00:43:05] <edgar-rft> gilberth: no joke, when I still worked in a regular job as an electronics repairman I had the habit to talk with the machines
[00:43:51] <gilberth> edgar-rft: Yes, that's fine, I do that at times too, but giving it names?
[00:43:55] <pjb> Now, there's topology, but there's common topology.  Where there are not only one holeless form, but basically 3 (in 3D):  sphere forms (3D), disc (flat) forms (2D), and cylindrical (linear) forms (1D).  So flat-earthers (2D) may have difficulties with rockets because they're basically 1D objects used to go between 3D objects.
[00:45:58] <gilberth> What 3D objects?
[00:46:45] <edgar-rft> gilberth: giving desktops names is at least way better than fucking with phones
[00:47:09] <gilberth> Swedes around here?
[00:47:40] <edgar-rft> Alt+Win+3 switches to Asgard :-)
[00:49:06] <edgar-rft> gilberth: beach is originally from Sweden, but he's not here on #lispcafe
[00:49:47] <gilberth> The article explains that ficka means trousers. Hmm.
[00:50:25] <gilberth> edgar-rft: But then our Handy is just silly. Also a phone these days could be handy.
[00:50:35] <gilberth> * Although
[00:51:13] <edgar-rft> maybe their phones wear trousers?
[00:51:57] <aeth> edgar-rft: the world still only has two dimensions
[00:51:59] <aeth> the Earth is flat
[00:52:06] <edgar-rft> gilberth: Handy is a typical german wrong-translation, nobody calls a mobile phone a handy outside of germany
[00:52:16] <aeth> the Earth is flat in the literal sense: everything is 2D
[00:52:55] <edgar-rft> aeth: my brain is one-dimensional
[00:52:55] <aeth> I'm mad that a subset of 3D Earthers have taken over the "Flat Earther" label
[00:53:04] <gilberth> As all the other wannabe English terms like "public viewing".
[00:54:19] <selwyn> what does handy mean and why is it silly
[00:54:24] <aeth> btw, holes aren't real, since the Earth is 2D, you'd just go through to the other side if you dug a hole
[00:54:36] <aeth> so digging has to be fake
[00:54:48] <edgar-rft> gilberth: best wrong-translation I know is bodybag instead of backpack as seen in several tv and newspaper commercials :-)
[00:55:26] <gilberth> edgar-rft: I know, still it sounds English, which is a trap. Why not "beFeAp" = "beweglicher Fernsprechapperat"? :)
[00:56:04] <gilberth> egdar-rft: Indeed. We once lived above a clothes store and they had body bags on sale!
[00:56:51] <gilberth> Always handy to have a body bag around -- you never know.
[00:57:04] * edgar-rft orders a bodybag to be prepared for his funeral
[00:59:45] <gilberth> selwyn: "Handy" means nothing at all in German otherwise.
[01:00:22] <edgar-rft> selwyn: in germany a "handy" is a mobile phone because you hold in in your hand. In the 1990s and early 200s when the internet started it was fashionable to give everything english-sounding names with some highly idiotic results :-)
[01:00:54] * gilberth mumbles "Knochen".
[01:01:32] <gilberth> "Knochen" = bone is in use for non-smart mobile phones.
[01:01:33] <selwyn> lol
[01:04:22] <gilberth> selwyn: Which is a nice trap, because really better remember which English terms aren't English at all and would mean something completely different.
[01:04:47] <gilberth> Not that we won't have enough false friends already.
[01:06:14] <selwyn> i was informed recently about an ´anglish´ movement which essentially tries to bring english back to germanic roots
[01:06:23] <selwyn> it looks pretty
[01:06:43] <gilberth> Oh, words like "swine" and "stool"?
[01:07:23] <selwyn> more than that
[01:07:40] <gilberth> *gasp* A grammar?
[01:08:05] <selwyn> re the cd project hack a few months back
[01:08:08] <selwyn> > The game-making house will not work with the hackers, and it is helping lawwards as they underseek the happening.
[01:08:41] <selwyn> The last few months have been rough for the game-making house. Cyberpunk 2077 came out in December and became the heart of laughter for not running well on Xbox One or Playstation 4, all while sayings spread that the business had an unhealthy work stead, and was making workers work too long each day.
[01:08:44] <selwyn> what an excellent sentence
[01:15:40] <gilberth> selwyn: I mean, like Old English? I recently have seen a few videos about it on YT. Like this one: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9Dagt3SWoo> I actually understood "Ic hæbbe syx ond twentig fēoh būtan mīn hūs." Almost Low German. :)
[01:15:41] -ixelp- Old English Language | Can American, Australian, and Non-Native English speaker understand it? | #2 - YouTube
[01:16:24] <edgar-rft> English was not only influenced by Anglia and Saxonia (old german tribes) and I think language development must go forwards, not backwards.
[01:17:38] <gilberth> edgar-rft: You believe in the awful new trend of so called gender-neutral speech in German?
[01:18:21] <edgar-rft> gilberth: language always reflects the idiocy of its speakers :-)
[01:19:58] <gilberth> Heh, have you actually heard this new trend of using the Danish stød in real life. Besides nobody could actually speak it that way.
[01:21:15] * edgar-rft doesn't listen to trends
[01:21:41] * gilberth rather sets trends.
[01:23:08] <edgar-rft> At the radio there are several school teachers and if they make me mad I start to talk sexistic shit to them and they instantly go nuts! Works great :-)
[01:23:12] <selwyn> it looks so cute though
[01:23:21] <selwyn> > game-making house
[01:24:30] <gilberth> edgar-rft: As a form of self-defense?
[01:25:32] <edgar-rft> gilberth: I teach them howto speak politically incorrect
[01:26:16] <gilberth> That is 3.141592... then? Great!
[01:32:10] <gilberth> For the English speakers here: In German there always a female form of words for people, Like as with a few in English like waiter and waitress. In German it's with "-in" or "-innen" in plural. So the recent trend is to teach us not say "Kellner", but "Kellner:innen". With the ":" being a stød, a brief pause. Nobody gets this correct and it offten sounds like "Kellner INNEN" stressed wrong.
[01:34:19] <gilberth> Thing is: The plural "Kellner" would gramatically already include the female sex, which however is not acknowledged. IMHO those who speak that way draw a dividing line between the genders, where none belongs in the first place. So this solves a problem, which didn't exist to begin with.
[01:35:29] <gilberth> It would be like always saying "driver:ess", "hacker:ess", and so on.
[01:36:33] <selwyn> there is a similar movement in spanish to give nouns an ´-x´ ending
[01:36:45] <selwyn> but it seems like a butchery of the language
[01:37:12] <selwyn> x is almost never used in spanish anyway, it´s like they tried to come up with the most awkward way of doing it
[01:37:29] <gilberth> Heh.
[01:37:51] <selwyn> it is not used that much in spanish speaking countries anyway
[01:38:01] <selwyn> iiuc
[01:38:06] <gilberth> So how it is pronounced? Like "iks" or like "ch"?
[01:39:02] <selwyn> ´x´ is usually pronounced with a breathing sound, but in this case i think like ´iks´
[01:39:56] * selwyn remembers spanish
[01:40:19] * gilberth has zero knowledge of Spanish.
[01:40:27] <selwyn> i learnt quite a lot at one point
[01:41:21] <selwyn> if you want to make a point, you can change the gender of a noun /most/ of the time and it will not change meaning
[01:41:47] <selwyn> i.e. you can make the word ´bitch´ masculine if you want and it has a similar meaning for men
[01:42:17] <gilberth> You speak about Spanish here?
[01:42:22] <selwyn> yes
[01:42:48] <selwyn> hm
[01:42:49] <gilberth> Yes, then why a change, they should be "safe" then.
[01:43:36] <selwyn> the impetus for this seems to come from the usa
[01:43:45] <selwyn> hence why x is not pronounced as it should
[01:44:00] <selwyn> as i say, it is not popular in spanish speaking countries afaik
[01:45:34] <selwyn> but you can change the gender of say ´apple´ to get ´apple tree´
[01:46:05] <gilberth> selwyn: Wait a second. There are a few words in German still which are grammatically female, yet could as well refer to a male person. You mentioned "bitch", works that way in German too. It is "die Schlampe" [female], but could also apply to males. Hmm *think*
[01:47:00] <selwyn> there are less pejorative examples i suppose
[01:47:56] <gilberth> Well, a person in a leading position at a company is "die Führungskraft" :) female!
[01:50:16] <selwyn> some languages are completely gender-neutral, and using them is no great illuminatory experience
[01:50:24] <selwyn> anyway, i think we have had this conversation at some point
[01:50:41] <gilberth> Yes, we had.
[01:51:08] <selwyn> "Knochen" for a non smartphone is amusing, since it is usually called a brick phone here
[01:51:22] <selwyn> but in america, a drop phone
[01:52:05] <gilberth> I still find it silly that "they" draw a dividing line between genders where none belongs by stressing that the grammatically male form would only include the male gender. I find that silly.

[15:18:52] <shka> ... how?
[15:19:37] <hayley> Shabby kraft^Wcraftwork.
[15:27:01] <shka> but radioactive cobalt contamination?
[15:27:53] <shka> how the hell you do that by accident?
[15:28:31] <hayley> I think I got cobalt dust in modded Minecraft when processing iron ore, and given that people don't come up with these reactions out of thin air, I guess they got contaminated iron or something?
[15:28:31] <pjb> Well, you don't go around with geiser counters usually.  Even when you're in the raw metal business.
[15:29:00] <hayley> "Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron."
[15:29:12] <shka> pjb: yeah, but how the hell radioactive cobalt got into the steel?
[15:29:33] <pjb> Just natural cobalt.  It contains radiactive isotopes naturally.
[15:30:07] <shka> Cobalt-60 does not occur naturally
[15:30:32] <shka> it is synthetic isotope 
[15:30:56] <shka> and you gonna nuclear reactor to produce it i think
[15:31:01] <pjb> Well, I'm wrong, indeed, the max half life for radioactive isotopes of cobalt is about 5 years, so it must be some recycled artificial radioactive isotope.
[15:31:28] <pjb> Yes, and so much that there's a scarcity of radioactive cobalt, since we have so few nuclear reactor.
[15:31:37] <shka> EXACTLY
[15:31:46] <pjb> Probably, it's not cobalt, but some other element that is found with it.
[15:32:04] <shka> and some idiot tossed it into scrapyard or something
[15:32:55] <pjb> Something like that, yes.
[15:33:00] <shka> yeah, apparently there is no cyclotron production of Cobalt-60 so it must came from reactor.
[15:33:24] <shka> wtf India?
[15:33:39] <pjb> As I said, nowadays scrap metal and recycling enterprises should have geiser counters to check and filter out such stuff…

[16:07:50] <gilberth> It's a pity that my Corona data web scrapper was so quick and dirty and stopped working soon. I should have used orginal official sources. As I'd like to have an extrapolation tool. As people since over a year still don't get it. What also would be nice is to have numbers of vaccinated people, and lock-down measures.

[17:05:50] <shka> ok
[17:09:05] <hayley> Seems though I want to work on SICL, I have problems actually working on it. Never mind that I can't sleep and am probably physically sick (fucking cold again?), I am also more depressed than I was a month + a day ago. Then I have to figure what is next to do, which is tricky.
[17:10:08] <shka> hayley: please, get some rest
[17:10:37] <shka> spending all of your time in front of the computer screen does not help you 
[17:12:27] <selwyn> doesn´t help anyone really

[17:19:23] <shka> i still have to beat arcane dimensions

[17:21:32] <gilberth> shka: A pity. Somehow I "lost" my Quake I.
[17:21:48] <shka> it is dirt cheap on the GOG 
[17:22:41] <gilberth> Sure. But I used to have a copy with hundreds of mods. Played it in grayscale most of the time :)
[17:24:02] <shka> well, quake was almost grayscale to begin with
[17:24:38] <shka> anyway, arcane dimensions is allegedly really, really good
[17:25:05] <gilberth> Yes, but I had a nice 19" grayscale screen in mid-90s. Fixed resolution, so I implemented upscaling for Quake.
[17:26:16] <selwyn> as i have mentioned before, i wish that i could still somehow do mathematics all day without spending time on the computer
[17:26:40] <selwyn> the ´aesthetics´, or whatever the correct term is, of an activity are important
[17:27:15] <selwyn> sitting in a room, with daylight coming in, doing pen and paper work is relaxing
[17:27:33] <selwyn> whereas even after a triumphant 8 hour hacking session, i feel utterly drained, and i imagine others do too
[17:27:39] <selwyn> this shit isn´t healthy
[17:28:31] <gilberth> Hacking is recreational for me.
[17:29:04] <gilberth> Hmm, I can find Quake only for Windows. But then, all I'd miss is the .pak files, which in theory I already have.
[17:29:06] <selwyn> for me as well, but it still exhausts me
[17:30:05] <shka> gilberth: does not matter, you would be running source port anyway
[17:32:54] <gilberth> Source port?
[17:33:31] <shka> quake is open source, so there are numerous improvements to the original code base
[17:34:14] <gilberth> Anyhow, there was once a very clean and readable and small totally from scratch implementation of Quake using GL. Tuned for it being readable, not for speed. I never was able to find it again. :(
[17:34:46] <gilberth> shka: I know, so many implementations to choose from all buggy.
[17:34:59] <gilberth> Or ports, rather.
[17:36:32] <hayley> While not "classic" Quake, I found DarkPlaces to look good.
[17:38:12] <hayley> I remember the animation interpolation was nice, and would be a nice touch for even GoldSrc games.
[17:38:47] * gilberth actually found some late 90s mods.
[17:39:15] <hayley> Also there is Quake on the Wii.
[17:39:56] <gilberth> How many .pak files does the original Quake have? I have a pak{0,1}.pak, perhaps that already is it?!
[17:40:11] <hayley> Somehow I accidentally turned on some tilt control, which sounds cool but actually made me sick, and I don't usually get sick by those things.
[17:42:38] <gilberth> Ok. From what I find, this is all there is of ID pak files. Good. Now I'll only have to find a working Macos port.
[17:43:56] <hayley> Also funny that many people don't think I have a real job. For example, my asshole dad, some random asshole on gmod and some random asshole on a chatroom a friend from high school runs.
[17:44:21] <hayley> Typically when I mention the hourly rate they shut up.
[17:44:38] <gilberth> Well, 2.5h/wk is hardly a job :-p
[17:45:30] <gilberth> But you probably make more that part-time scanning groceries.
[17:45:43] <hayley> Very funny. But I am sick evidently, else I really would want to work more.
[17:46:49] <gilberth> When you're sick, milady, there is your bed: -->  ,---/
[17:47:16] <hayley> And I do mean that - I'd kill for a fully metacircular CL and writing a code generator is much less bloody. I still believe jobs are a poor motivator for anything, but I have external motivation for this one. Usually.
[17:48:00] <hayley> Same with ole Netfarm. The audience doesn't care because they assume it to be unthinkable in some ways.
[17:49:05] <gilberth> Is there really internal motivation? Isn't it all external in the long run?
[17:50:21] <gilberth> Or the other way round? Hmm.
[17:51:52] <hayley> I meant that the job itself (here is however much a year, now scrub these toilets out) is not encouraging of much. And being stuck with one job is boring. (And having more is...usually overworking yourself cause you are broke.)
[17:53:02] <hayley> There was a story from someone who worked at a sewerage plant who liked it as they could see what people flushed. No one tells you that.
[17:56:12] <hayley> My statement "but I have external motivation for this one" is rather that I have more reasons to hack than money. I already did before without any money, but now that there are things to do, and now that I may need it in the near future, I went for a job.
[17:59:11] <gilberth> Sure, money never was a motivation.
[18:00:19] <gilberth> Unfortunately you still need some.
[18:00:30] <hayley> OTOH, making money off Netfarm is just about impossible for good reasons, and my other projects are nowhere close to marketable.
[18:01:11] <gilberth> You're a student, you could care about money later.
[18:01:51] <hayley> ("Good reasons" being that with replication, supply is almost infinitely scalable so your price drops to 0 quickly. Or something, I am not an economist.)
[18:01:56] <gilberth> Thinking of it, I only really worked some eight years. *shrug*
[18:02:09] <gilberth> Worked for money, that is.
[18:02:16] <hayley> I also want to move out and need some money for reference books and things.
[18:02:38] <hayley> And school isn't free either.
[18:02:47] <gilberth> Sure, but you'll find hacking jobs. A few hours would do.
[18:03:16] <gilberth> hayley: Well, but don't you have to pay school only in the future?
[18:03:55] <hayley> .oO( Hire me for concurrent projects, I will make Cliff Click look like a Python user and Joe Armstrong look like a C programmer at the same tine )
[18:05:02] <hayley> Right, I repay the loan as if it were tax. But one wants to get it over with sooner than later, as they track inflation...now. though there are scary stories about debts already.
[18:07:03] <hayley> Furthermore, with what I have, I do pay some upfront as they discount you for that. Like if you pay $200 upfront they take 10% off or so.
[18:09:07] <gilberth> ok. A pity, that they track inflation, as my guess is, we will get plenty of it.
[18:10:22] <gilberth> Starts with materials we need for my company. Up some 20%+ already. But that is shortage.
[18:18:18] <hayley> Still it is not cheap. Not USA level expensive, but some magnitudes off EU prices from what I hear.
[18:22:59] <shka> hayley: EU prices are completely dependent on the individual country as the education system in the Europe is by no means uniform 
[18:23:34] <shka> having said, public funding of the education is considered to be a common sense, mostly
[18:23:44] <hayley> And again, my own books and equipment aren't free. Though would I pay tax, apparently the equipment costs can be deducted. Then there is the non-work stuff as well, of course.
[18:24:14] <shka> but this depends on the country, for instance system in Germany is very distinct to one in France 
[18:24:20] <hayley> shka: Right.
[18:27:12] <shka> I think that only anglosaxon higher education is so insanely expensive 
[18:27:47] <hayley> I also have to factor in that they discounted this year by a third or so. So, anything in mainland Europe close to €3000/year?
[18:28:27] <gilberth> idk. It's free here.
[18:28:49] <hayley> beach had me convinced that €300 was closer to normal in France.
[18:29:08] <shka> well, how i would know what are the prices in Portugal for instance?
[18:29:12] <shka> that is the issue
[18:29:18] <gilberth> But of course you need somewhere to live and some food. So it's really free, in a sense.
[18:29:27] <hayley> Right, right.
[18:29:59] <gilberth> Well, in Germany being a student is considered a job, hence no welfare.
[18:32:06] <gilberth> So you either have parents paying for you, which they are obligated to until age 25, or work. When you're parents are cheap, you could get a cheap loan from the state.
[18:33:01] <hayley> Well, a loan isn't much better than where I am now, though idk how "everything else" compares to university classes in price.
[18:33:34] <gilberth> After all you have costs of living.

[20:45:34] <SAL9000> gilberth: I'm guessing it's default-off because of the perception/myth (right or wrong) that vsync increases input latency.
[20:45:58] <SAL9000> (i.e. latency from "player moves mouse" to "player sees character rotate on screen")
[20:53:45] *** Quits: nihaal (~nihaal@106.201.177.18) (Quit: nihaal)
[21:13:39] <Alfr> Can't the program process input without rerendering the scene?!
[21:15:16] <ck_> it can, but there are those that do everything in the same step as the rendering, so you can detect it as a player
[21:19:13] <Alfr> For no good reason, the outcome is influenced by how often you take measurements? Bad experimental design!
[21:20:27] * Alfr actually meant to say: badly designed experiment

[22:47:45] <gilberth> SAL9000: (1) 1200FPS is insane (2) I actually hate the tear you may see with not synched. (3) And I hate my fan spinning like crazy.
[22:50:51] <gilberth> And (4) My cousin feeds on french fries only, smell up here is accordingly. *sigh*
