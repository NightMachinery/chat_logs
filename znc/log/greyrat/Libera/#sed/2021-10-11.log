[11:51:25] <tsujp> im trying to append the text ":/opt/miniconda/bin" to the line starting with "ENV_SUPATH" but I am getting unknown command |
[11:51:33] <tsujp> sed '|^ENV_SUPATH| s|$/:/opt/miniconda/bin/|' /etc/login.defs
[11:56:43] <tsujp> got it, I only needed to change the command delimiter in the second command
[11:56:49] <tsujp> sed '/^ENV_SUPATH/ s|$|/blah|' /etc/login.defs
[12:00:28] <geirha> you have to use a backslash to change the address regex delimiters.  E.g. \|^ENV_SUPATH|
[12:01:23] <emanuele6> the other problem was that s|$/:/opt/miniconda/bin/| is missing the replacement part, but i think you figured it out 
[12:05:18] <tsujp> using just forward slash for the regex worked combined with pipes for the replace command.. is that a coincidence or actually valid? I need to re-read up on sed
[12:15:22] <emanuele6> you can use any character to delimit the arguments of the s command:  s|$|/blah| or sc$c/blahc or s@$@/blah@ etc  
[12:16:29] <emanuele6> you can also use any character for /regex/, but if you want to use a character different from /, you need to put a \: \@^ENV_SUPATH@

[14:36:53] <ripspin> got a simple sed problem, do you get the same? https://termbin.com/7n9a
[14:37:28] <Soliton> what is that supposed to do?
[14:37:41] <Soliton> / is a forward slash, btw.
[14:38:21] <ripspin> i call it a slah and \ a back slash
[14:38:50] <Soliton> in your paste it says "backslash (/)".
[14:39:13] <Soliton> so what are you trying to replace?
[14:40:29] <ripspin> sorry about that yes i meant back slash
[14:41:16] <ripspin> it is the error from sed that is the problem
[14:41:34] <Soliton> well, the same as sed i have zero clue what you're trying to do.
[14:41:54] <Soliton> the format of the s command: s/regex/replacement/flags
[14:42:06] <ripspin> https://termbin.com/en78 corrected version
[14:42:44] <Soliton> you have  s/@/ /  which replaces an at with space and then you have some more stuff.
[14:43:03] <Soliton> stuff that is not a valid flag so who knows what the goal is.
[14:43:45] <ripspin> this is what the manual says: Atom Description: \{N\} 	Exactly N
[14:45:15] <geirha> in a regex, yes. You put it outside a regex
[14:45:31] <ripspin> checkout: https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html  search for: but matches exactly
[14:47:09] <geirha> inside a regex, it has a defined purpose. Outside a regex, it's gibberish, which is why sed is outputting an error
[14:47:30] <Soliton> dude, you could just say what you're trying to do.
[14:48:13] <Soliton> again, the format of the s command: s/regex/replacement/flags
[14:48:24] <Soliton> if you write a command with that format then sed will understand it.
[14:49:02] <Soliton> or you can change the delimiter (/) to something else if it's in the regex or replacement.
[14:49:49] <ripspin> the sed command is: \sed  -n  's/@/ /\{1\}'  the   \{1\} are the flags: checkout: https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html  search for: but matches exactly
[14:50:09] <Soliton> amazing how complicated it is to state the goal.
[14:50:18] <Soliton> the command is gibberish.
[14:50:53] <Soliton> \{1\} is not a valid value for a flag. it looks like it was supposed to be a regex but the regex is just @ there.
[14:50:53] <geirha> sed is saying \ is not a valid flag. \{1\} makes sense as part of a regex, it's not a valid sequence of flags
[14:51:22] <ripspin> if you do not know much about sed then it would look like gibberish
[14:51:33] <geirha> meh, idiot
[14:51:48] <Soliton> no the other way around. if you know sed like you know the sed command then it makes no sense.
[14:52:09] <Soliton> but feel free to argue with sed.
[14:52:34] <ripspin> Tell me wot "\+" flag means then
[14:52:44] <Soliton> nothing it is not a valid flag.
[14:53:40] <Soliton> perhaps you don't know what a flag to the s command is. you can look up the valid flags here: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html
[14:53:41] *** Joins: tangy (~tangy@user/tangy)
[14:53:51] <ripspin> I gave you the gnu web site for sed to show you. wot can i say?
[14:54:23] <emanuele6> :|
[14:54:28] <Soliton> the website was not talking about flags to the s command there.
[14:54:31] <geirha> It's explaining REGEX SYNTAX. You have to use it INSIDE a fucking REGEX
[14:55:28] <Soliton> besides not being a flag \{1\} is also fairly useless in a regex.
[14:55:29] <geirha> this will replace exactly two @s with an X   s/@\{2\}/X/
[14:55:53] <ripspin> How can it be part of a regex when it refers to a number of maches?
[14:56:29] <ripspin> a regex only catches wot it matches thats it
[14:56:31] <Soliton> \{1\} means match the previous part exactly a single time.
[14:56:49] <Soliton> which is what happens without it anyway. hence why it's useless.

[14:57:35] <geirha> 2 or 3 of the preceding atom
[14:58:08] <ripspin> at least 2 and a max of 3
[14:58:24] <geirha> yes, and greedily, so it will match 3 if it can, 2 if not
[15:00:05] <ripspin> so wot does \+ mean. it is in the manual
[15:00:28] <emanuele6> it is a GNU extension to BRE, it means the same that + means in EREs 
[15:00:31] <Soliton> it is a GNU sed extension that means the same as \{1,\}
[15:00:32] <geirha> It's a GNU extension that meanst the same as \{1,\}
[15:01:04] <ripspin> it means at least 1
[15:01:19] <geirha> yes
[15:01:38] <emanuele6> but prefer \{1,\}
[15:03:45] <geirha> and you use it as part of the regex, just like \{...\}
[15:05:42] <ripspin> how do i delimit the regex?
[15:06:15] <geirha> delimit it from what?
[15:06:50] <ripspin> so it can only refer to the whole regex?
[15:08:12] <geirha> no
[15:12:24] <ripspin> I had assumed that the \{i,j\} format was a flag construct, I think now that it may have been an incorrect assumption
