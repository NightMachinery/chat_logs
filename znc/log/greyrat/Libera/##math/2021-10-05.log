[03:28:11] <cuppajoeman> I think I'm just getting used to the new terminology but when we say that a set U is open in X it means that for any topology defined on X that U is an element of such a topology?
[03:28:23] <PlanckWalk> cuppajoeman: Yes, that theorem says that you can use a smaller basis
[03:29:21] <cuppajoeman> Specifically this:https://i.imgur.com/N7OPxaN.png
[03:29:35] *** Joins: euphrates[m] (~euphrates@2001:470:69fc:105::fbb5)
[03:29:46] <PlanckWalk> But eh no, you have to have a particular topology to say that some set is open.
[03:30:11] <PlanckWalk> Usually "open in X" means "open in X with the topology that is implied by context"
[03:30:43] <PlanckWalk> Or sometimes "X" means the set together with a topology, not just the set.
[03:31:09] *** Quits: kakashiAL (~kakashi@ip-37-201-199-21.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[03:31:31] <cuppajoeman> So when they say X is a topological space they're implying that there's a topology too
[03:31:34] <PlanckWalk> Especially things like "open in R^n" usually means "R^n together with the usual topology generated by the usual metric"
[03:31:40] <cuppajoeman> Ok
[03:31:40] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[03:31:48] <cuppajoeman> https://i.imgur.com/YHpHEnU.png - Product Topology
[03:32:18] <cuppajoeman> A basis for it is U x V where U is open in X and V is open in Y
[03:32:42] <cuppajoeman> So this means that we first fix some topology Tx and Ty, then we are saying that U in Tx and V in Ty?
[03:33:02] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[03:33:19] <cuppajoeman> And we are saying cal(B) = {U x V: U in Tx and V in Ty} is a basis for Tx(cross)y
[03:34:29] <cuppajoeman> Then how do we know that set U x Y is open in X x Y ? (https://i.imgur.com/NdWEdxN.png)
[03:34:47] <PlanckWalk> A basis for "the product topology of (X,Tx) by (Y,Ty)"
[03:35:08] <PlanckWalk> Which there is not given any particular symbol.
[03:35:17] <cuppajoeman> Wait so not what I said?
[03:35:42] <PlanckWalk> Well, Tx(cross)Ty is just a particular cartesian product

[03:35:57] <cuppajoeman> Oh sorry I meant that as notation for "the product topology
[03:36:06] <PlanckWalk> Tx is just a set (of sets) and so is Ty, so Tx(cross)Ty is just a set of pairs of sets.
[03:36:08] <cuppajoeman> Yes
[03:36:12] <cuppajoeman> I didn't mean it
[03:36:28] <cuppajoeman> I meant Tx(cross)y notating "the product topology"
[03:36:33] <cuppajoeman> on X x Y
[03:36:40] <PlanckWalk> Right.  It's just ambiguous
[03:36:41] <cuppajoeman> I see how it's confusing
[03:36:57] <PlanckWalk> The definition there doesn't give any notation for explicitly referring to the topology
[03:37:07] <PlanckWalk> Just "The product topology on XxY"
[03:37:16] <cuppajoeman> I'll call it Tp for now
[03:37:42] <cuppajoeman> So Tp would be the collection of unions of elements from the basis right
[03:37:45] <PlanckWalk> Anyway yes if U is open in X and V is open in Y then UxV is open in XxY
[03:38:04] <PlanckWalk> Or if you prefer,  U in Tx and V in Ty implies UxV in Tp

[03:40:59] <cuppajoeman> and a basis is always a subset of the topology?
[03:41:10] <cuppajoeman> So then U x Y is an element of Tp ?
[03:41:21] <dude12312414> also useful to know: empty unions give the empty set, and empty intersections give the entire space
[03:41:50] <dude12312414> (i mean unions and intersections of an empty collection of sets)
[03:41:53] <cuppajoeman> Ah ok

We recently covered Cauchy's Theorem, and I am struggling to see how it relates to the mean value property of harmonic functions. Cauchy's Theorem, as we have stated it, says that closed integrals of holomorphic functions are 0. Meanwhile, the mean value property states that if u:C->R is harmonic, then the mean value of u along a circle is the same
[04:34:43] <tsandstr> as the value of u at the center.
[04:34:43] <tsandstr> However, if we have a holomorphic funciton u with real part u, these two results seem to contradict each other.

[04:52:51] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: look at that picture you shared, do you see how the inverse of the projection creates these 'bands', and the intersection of two of these bands create a basis set of the form UxV?
[04:53:16] <cuppajoeman> Yeah I see how it must create UxV
[04:53:48] <cuppajoeman> So since UxV can be written of a finite intersection of elements of S then it's in T'?

[04:56:32] *** Joins: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201)
[04:56:57] <somiaj> so since all open sets of the form UxV are in the toplogy generated by your subbasis, that topology is smaller than the subbasis toplogy
[04:57:32] <somiaj> here we have no elements that we are chasing around like in the lemma you posted
[04:59:07] <cuppajoeman> But they do it just for basis elements UxV
[04:59:31] <cuppajoeman> How do we know it will be true that any element of the product topology will be an element of the topology generated by the subbasis S
[05:00:31] <somiaj> because every basis element in the product topology T is also an element of the subbasis toplogy T', due to UxV is a fininte intersection of inverse projections
[05:00:41] <somiaj> so thust T' subseteq T
[05:01:09] <cuppajoeman> Oh it's because every element of the product topology is a union of basis elements, and we know each basis element is in the topology generated by the subbasis so then the union of all the basis elements is also an elementin the topology generated by the subbbasis?
[05:01:24] <somiaj> basically this is jsut saying that there could possiblbe be other sets generated by the subbasis (more intersections/unions) that aren't in the product toplogy, this part only shows that T subseteq T'
[05:01:24] <cuppajoeman> (sorry writing that in the middle of your post)
[05:01:48] <somiaj> basically
[05:02:05] <somiaj> I just think of it in terms of 'smallest toplogy containing' vs 'generate by using unions/intersections'
[05:02:42] <somiaj> Let A be any subset of P(X), then the topology generated by A is int_{A subset T, T a topology on X} T
[05:03:07] <somiaj> Thus the topology generated by any set is the smallest topology containing A.
[05:03:31] <somiaj> Now in the case of a basis, you can generate every set in the topology by taking arbitary unions of basis sets

[05:15:53] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: one can go in either direction, for different purposes:  (1) Given some set X (no topology on it yet), and some collection B of arbitrary subsets of X whose union is X, this B then defines a topology T_B on X in which everything in B is now an open set and T_B is the smallest possible such topology on X. This T_B ends up having exactly all possible unions of finite intersections of things from B -- so B is a subbasis for
[05:15:53] <Z-module> T_B.   (2) Or (Other direction) if you start with some topological space (X,T), you might want to specify a particular subcollection of T, call it B, so that T turns out to be exactly all the possible unions of finite intersections of things in B. So this is giving a subbasis B for the topology T.

[05:33:28] <PlanckWalk> What is S?
[05:33:37] <PlanckWalk> Ah okay, I see it
[05:33:58] <PlanckWalk> The topology generated by S has {a} in it
[05:34:11] <PlanckWalk> (As the intersection of {a,b} and {a,e})
[05:34:23] <Z-module> The topology generated by S as subbasis is: { {}, X, {a}, {a,b}, {a,e}, {a,b,e}, {c,d}, {a,c,d}, {a,b,c,d}, {a,e,c,d} }

[05:35:04] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[05:35:08] <cuppajoeman> But the topology generated by B is the colliction of all arbitrary unions of elements of B
[05:35:27] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[05:35:42] <cuppajoeman> Topology generated by (...) definition differs based on whether (...) is a subbasis or a basis
[05:35:48] <PlanckWalk> Every basis is also a subbasis, but the reverse isn't true.

[05:36:17] <PlanckWalk> So in that sense the definition doesn't change
[05:36:38] <PlanckWalk> The collection of all finite intersections of a basis is just the basis.
[05:36:47] <dude12312414> i would say that "generated by" is a bit ambiguous, and the "generation procedure" is usually implied from the context
[05:36:54] <dude12312414> well
[05:36:57] <PlanckWalk> So they're really the same procedure.

[05:37:19] <cuppajoeman> The defintion seems different for me though: https://i.imgur.com/ZybJz8X.png (subbasis) and then https://i.imgur.com/2mk4XGp.png
[05:37:32] <PlanckWalk> Yes, the wording differs.
[05:37:57] <PlanckWalk> They are still both "the smallest topology containing that set"
[05:37:57] <dude12312414> yeah i guess if you always take unions of finite intersections, that works for both basis and subbasis (it's just that the finite intersection is redundant in the basis case)
[05:38:04] <Z-module> Right. cuppajoeman, you would benefit from doing the exercise just implied: If B is a basis for a topology on X, show that {all unions of things in B} = {all unions of finite intersections of things in B}.  It's easy but not entirely immediate from definitions.
[05:38:25] <PlanckWalk> And the unions of the finite intersections gives you that smallest topology in both cases.
[05:38:53] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[05:39:01] <PlanckWalk> But if you start from a basis, you don't strictly need the finite intersections since a basis already contains all those.
[05:39:09] <Z-module> actually not
[05:39:33] <Z-module> a basis does not need to itself be closed under finite intersection
[05:39:49] <PlanckWalk> Oh, right.  Meh :-(
[05:40:11] <Z-module> but the process of forming all unions of finite intersections of things in B gives nothing new vs. just unions of things in B
[05:40:16] <Z-module> when B is a basis
[05:40:16] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[05:41:00] <Z-module> you could almost argue that the concept of basis is superfluous and messy, with its weird criterion to qualify, and we just do everything in terms of subbases.
[05:41:24] <PlanckWalk> I forgot that silly little quirk, and yeah I pretty much always use subbases whenever the concept of generating topologies comes up.
[05:41:50] <Z-module> (but then, if you're inclined to argue for that, you might also argue that we don't need to specify commutativity of addition to be a ring with 1)
[05:41:56] <PlanckWalk> If some text mentions "base" then I just mentally use it as a subbase.

[06:49:34] <int-e> "clamp" is fairly standard too

[06:58:37] <qergle> ok, so you're basically, clipping the position to be within the bouinds square
[06:58:54] <qergle> anything that goes beyond some edge is clamped back to the edge?
[06:58:55] <int-e> Math.floor(x * (this._dimensions[0] - 1)) scales it up to [0,t._d[0]-1] before truncating
[06:59:03] <int-e> So that makes it an index.

[10:01:31] <twJizhan> hello I am trying to learn what is a "computable function" or/and the definition of a "computable function"
[10:02:07] <twJizhan> but could someone explain in simple English to help me that
[10:02:11] <twJizhan> what is a "computable function" or/and the definition of a "computable function"?
[10:03:24] <Franciman> twJizhan: Hi
[10:03:42] <Franciman> I think, at first it could be helpful to distinguish between computable function and calculable function
[10:03:54] <Franciman> a calculable function is a vague idea that we want to capture
[10:04:25] <Franciman> the class of calculable functions would be the class of all functions that we can well.. calculate
[10:04:41] <Franciman> it is a very vague idea, but I hope it clicks with you
[10:05:22] <Franciman> imagine wanting to study all possible computations that we can do
[10:05:24] <Franciman> ok now
[10:05:50] <Franciman> there have been various attempts at giving a _mathematical_ definition of this concept
[10:06:13] <Franciman> and most of them turned out to be equivalent
[10:06:33] <Franciman> so we have Turing-computable functions [i.e. functions that can be computed by a turing machine]
[10:06:44] <twJizhan> ... thank you :) listening (and scratching head)
[10:06:46] <Franciman> then we have recursive functions
[10:06:49] *** Joins: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso)
[10:06:49] <Franciman> oh wait
[10:07:06] <Franciman> twJizhan: is there something you don't understand in particular?
[10:07:48] <Franciman> btw there are different definitions of computable functions, and they all agree.
[10:08:12] <Franciman> usually one restricts itself to functions f : \mathbb{N}^k -> \mathbb{N}^t
[10:08:21] <Franciman> i.e. to functions from natural numbers to natural numbers
[10:08:46] <Franciman> (in this digital era, I hope you don't have trouble recognizing the kind of reductionism it is applied here
[10:09:06] <Franciman> digitalization was basically at work, converting every mathematical object to just natural numbers :D)
[10:09:07] <twJizhan> Wikipedia has no page/entry for "calculable function" so I guess it is not a standard and commonly used term in current academics ?
[10:09:27] <Franciman> twJizhan: it is a very vague idea, I wanted to use
[10:09:38] <Franciman> it is not a term used, I suppose
[10:09:52] <Franciman> for example Turing work was devising a machine
[10:09:57] <Franciman> that could solve all problems a person can
[10:10:18] <Franciman> (once it gets instructed the correct way)
[10:10:45] <Franciman> while Church's work was defining a calculus for doing all possible computations in math
[10:11:10] <Franciman> so twJizhan really there are different definitions of computable function, two I can easily mention are:
[10:11:13] <Franciman> - recursive functions
[10:11:17] <Franciman> - turing machines
[10:11:29] <Franciman> recursive functions are particularily easy to present
[10:11:36] <twJizhan> (nowadays calculus should teach some very basic computability/complexity theory I humbly guess...)
[10:11:56] <Franciman> and it is instructive to first look at primitive recursive functions
[10:12:07] <Franciman> they are a subclass of recursive functions
[10:12:20] <Franciman> and it shows a first step at capturing the intuitive idea of calculable functions
[10:12:43] <Franciman> [failing, because they showed there were calculable functions that were not primitive recursive, look at the Ackermann's function]
[10:12:52] <Franciman> so they had to extend to the recursive functions class
[10:13:08] *** Parts: Times_ (~Times@180.248.30.254) ()
[10:13:10] <Franciman> now twJizhan there is a Law, yes a law in mathematics, there is no physics here lol, but a law!
[10:13:16] <Franciman> The Church-Turing Thesis
[10:13:41] <Franciman> it says, well, I conjecture that the computable functions are exactly all the calculable functions

From there, things might be substituted for x or y, like f(x,y)=z or f(x,y,z)=3.  In order for things like f(x)=y to be called a function, it should pass the vertical line test.

[19:57:27] <xaltsc> There are many takes on "generalisation": set theoretic ones, category theoretic one, Zorn ones, model theoretic ones, ad-hoc ones. It's not a concept in itself in maths afaik.
[19:58:14] <trace987> but there are the things that are to be prooved, but not the proof itself
[19:58:19] <xaltsc> For instance, the passing from Galois Groups to Weil Groups, is a generalisation of some kind, which can be seen as just a base change once the Langlands conjecture is proved, but historically it's not the case.

[20:26:15] <Z-module> Your question needs much more context.
[20:26:26] <Z-module> coefficients of what?
[20:27:14] <KillAnimals> This is the quadratic equation I am talking about. ax^2 + bx + c = 0
[20:27:31] <Mickael> so what ?
[20:27:34] <KillAnimals> So in one example, ax^2 + bx + 90 = 180
[20:28:05] <KillAnimals> oh wait
[20:28:07] <KillAnimals> hmmmm
[20:28:21] <Mickael> no ax^2+bx-90=0
[20:29:27] <Mickael> c=-90
[20:29:52] <KillAnimals> oh maybe I made a bad assumption. The original question is this:
[20:30:43] <KillAnimals> ( Im new to math. I am trying to learn how to make this intuitive to me )
[20:31:21] <KillAnimals> 7. Find A and B if A = φ and B = φ^2 .
[20:31:37] <KillAnimals> C is 90, and this is triginometry

[20:38:05] <qergle> i have no problem with it, ask INTERPOL
[20:38:24] <Z-module> Also, KillAnimals,  ax^2 + bx + c = 0  is general.  In your right-triangle situation, where  T + T^2 = 90 , that rearranges to  1*T^2 + 1*T - 90 = 0.  So you specifically have a = b = 1 here. You shouldn't have been inquiring about unspecified a, b in the first place.

[23:36:52] <biberao> riv: im doing math
[23:36:55] <biberao> help me out then
[23:38:25] <biberao> example f(x)=-1-cos(x/2+pi/6) how does it become -1-2sin(2x+pi/6)
[23:38:58] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:39:24] <riv> we can turn cos to sin
[23:39:38] <riv> see the graphs
[23:39:54] <riv> https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qrejfwqf6w
[23:40:06] <riv> sin(t) = cos(t - pi/2)
[23:40:40] <riv> so
[23:40:47] <riv> -1-cos(x/2+pi/6) = -1-cos(x/2+pi/6 - pi/2)
[23:40:50] <riv> sorry
[23:41:03] <riv> cos(t) = sin(t + pi/2)
[23:41:13] <riv> so -1-cos(x/2+pi/6) = -1-sin(x/2+pi/6 + pi/2)
[23:41:24] <biberao> yes
[23:41:28] <biberao> thats how i did it
[23:41:29] <riv> = -1-sin(x/2+2pi/3)
[23:41:44] <riv> differnt result from yours
[23:41:46] <biberao> i did cosx=sin(pi/2-x)
[23:41:56] <biberao> thats why i got confused you see
[23:42:40] <biberao> let me paste the pic

[23:44:18] <biberao> i dont even understand why they did the cos to sin when the sin isnt used anywhere else
[23:44:29] <riv> very odd
[23:44:54] <biberao> let me paste the whole resolution ok
[23:45:52] <biberao> maybe its an error
[23:45:56] <biberao> ive found a lot of errors here
[23:46:02] <biberao> on this particular book that is
[23:46:03] <millido> I don't understand how transfer functions work. If I have a filter y[n], how can I find the transfer function of that?
[23:46:42] <biberao> riv: https://imgur.com/26unGAY https://imgur.com/Goqt5J2 https://imgur.com/uK3MnNQ
[23:49:12] <cherim> Replace -1-2sin(2x+pi/6) back with  -1-2cos(x/2+pi/6) and the first paste is OK
[23:49:54] <biberao> so
[23:49:57] <biberao> its an error then?

[23:51:13] <cherim> It's correct as given too, but follows no useful logic
[23:51:25] <biberao> cherim: but how it went
[23:51:41] <biberao> from 2cos(x/2+pi/6) to 2sin(2x+pi/6)
[23:51:43] <biberao> ?
[23:52:11] <cherim> If f varies from -1 to 1, then -1+2f varies from -3 to 1. Nothing else needed
[23:52:24] <cherim> 2cos(x/2+pi/6) is not equal to 2sin(2x+pi/6)
[23:52:28] <biberao> ok
[23:52:29] *** Joins: bowlofeggs (~bowlofegg@fedora/bowlofeggs)
[23:52:34] <biberao> thats what my problem is
[23:52:38] <biberao> is it an error on that part?
[23:52:39] <cherim> One is period 4pi, another period pi, why equate
[23:52:57] <cherim> It's not an error, they both have the same range
[23:53:34] <cherim> But not equal pointwise, and it's unclear where the sin variant even came from and what for
[23:55:19] <biberao> ok
