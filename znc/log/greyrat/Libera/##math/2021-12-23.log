[00:19:23] <isekaijin> At least, if (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are K-rational points on G, then (x1+x2, y1+y2) is also a K-rational point on G.
[00:21:42] <isekaijin> Moreover, setting L = K(c^{1/p}), the base extension G \times_K L is a rational curve over L, in fact isomorphic to A^1.

[02:51:31] <isekaijin> Replicating ordinary classical mathematics feels a lot like “going against the grain” of type theory.
[02:51:38] <isekaijin> Although this seems to be exactly what the Lean folks are trying to do.
[02:52:08] <mycroftiv> Lean is really just using type theory as the implementation tool for classical definitions, to make it computer friendly really
[02:52:19] <mycroftiv> its not the same as univalent type theory foundations

[02:52:55] <mycroftiv> its quite interesting looking at how you can use type theory to code up any arbitrary formal system, or you can develop things inside it on its own - this is related to how type theory is the internal language of topos
[02:53:24] <isekaijin> Yeah, well, that looks like it could be interesting to a model theorist.
[02:53:44] <isekaijin> But for someone who wants to do ordinary mathematics, it's an extra complication.
[02:54:18] <mycroftiv> well the thing is 'ordinary mathematics' on pen and paper just sits there staring at you and you also have to have a computer inside your brain to generate it and verify it
[02:54:20] <isekaijin> You build a model of the foundational system you want inside another foundational system you don't want, just so that you can use the former, even though your tools only support the latter.

[02:55:13] <isekaijin> It's a kludge. It's not the right way to do things.
[02:55:26] <mycroftiv> so how we connect our calculations to our proofs and our notations and our understanding is an ongoing work-in-progres
[02:55:55] <mycroftiv> theres always going to be some kind of encoding, be it types and lambdas or binary bits or drawing pictures in the dirt with sticks and measuring with string
[02:57:17] <mycroftiv> so its always practical compromises with the freedom of abstract thought and whatever passes for quasi-platonic mathematical truth
[02:57:57] <isekaijin> Well, to me, the attractive thing about type theory is that, when you say something like “data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat”, then that's not really an encoding. It's literally what the natural numbers *are*. Unlike the various possible encodings of the natural numbers in set theory, which are all indeed encodings.

[03:00:52] <mycroftiv> there is a close correspondene between the core formers of constructive type theory and the universal algebraic constructions that you need to make a topos, and the structural-isomorphism view of what mathematical objects 'are'

[03:03:06] <isekaijin> No idea. I have looked at the definition of a topos less than ten times, and I have never used toposes in any serious way. My algebraic geometry professor is trying to convince me to learn about them, but first I need to find questions whose answers are easier to express with than without toposes.
[03:04:35] <mycroftiv> well, since you understand sheaves pretty well - better than myself by a long way - you understand a large amount of what toposes are, since 'sheaves on a site' is the Grothendieck/Giraud definition

[03:05:52] <isekaijin> I understand sheaves on a topological space. And I know that, since a sheaf is actually defined on the poset of opens of a topological space, then you could generalize it to sheaves on a locale or even a category satisfying certain properties. (No idea what exactly those “certain properties” should be, though.)
[03:05:59] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: since you care a lot about geometric ideas, one way to motivate topoi is that they give you a geometric understanding and insight/tools into structures from other mathematical areas
[03:07:04] <mycroftiv> if you understand how the universal constructions used in a topos have geometric meaning, when anything is expressed as 'and here is why this category of objects is a topos' you can use your geometric understanding of the meaning of the universal properties

[03:12:58] <mycroftiv> well, if you think in terms of abstract higher dimensional spatial geometry maybe it still often does? the formal tools are useful even if you feel like intuitions dont transfer
[03:13:17] <isekaijin> So, for me, homology is basically a general framework for turning topological / geometric questions into linear algebra questions. And, of course, simplicial, singular and cellular homology are some of the easiest to learn use cases of this framework.
[03:13:20] <johnkeats6> i think the most abstract intuition of co/homology is in terms of obstructions. holes present obstructions to extending functions across spaces
[03:13:30] <johnkeats6> but there's other kinds of obstructions
[03:14:01] <mycroftiv> i was learning a sheaf representation of connected logic circuits

[03:25:41] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Usually, we have geometric questions that, after some effort, can be translated into “can we find a section of this sheaf” (possibly satisfying additional properties).
[03:25:57] <johnkeats6> that voisin complex geometry book is ok. i was still scratching my head as to what a sheaf is, but at least you get some concrete results

[10:25:35] <mycroftiv> xelxebar: cool, its a fascinating maze of conceptual connections and vocabulary but i think there is meaning behind all the technicalities
[10:26:05] <xelxebar> By distilling down to "algebraic structure morphims", are you essentially just pointing at "category"?
[10:26:37] <mycroftiv> no, there is more to it than that, although category theory was developed to serve the purpose of understanding algebraic/homological structure in general
[10:27:14] <mycroftiv> the basic notion of 'category' itself is very weak, its really just a preorder
[10:28:04] <mycroftiv> so you need to add on a fair amount of additional structural rules - which can be expressed several ways - to get to a lot of meaningful use

[10:40:09] <mycroftiv> generating ultrapower models via an ultrafilter quotient construction is how i got a handle on what i think of as the core idea
[10:43:22] <mycroftiv> in constructive computational terms it translates into an ongoing process to build a 'generic object' that is hypothetically infinite by accumulating finite pieces of information in a process of progressive refinement
[10:46:00] <mycroftiv> you want to build a sheaf by progressively refining your filter towards the underlying ultrafilter

[14:05:02] <abdaellen> hi cadmio
[14:05:45] <cadmio> I need to prove the group E_2 of all planar isometries is the direct product of the orthogonal group O2(ℝ) and of the group T of translations.
[14:06:29] <cadmio> I think the first thing to show is that O_2(R) is a normal subgroup of E_2, right?

[14:08:42] <riv> cadmio: as was mentioned last time, it is a semidirect product - not a direct product
[14:10:06] <cadmio> yes it's a typo it'd be "semidirect"
[14:10:25] <riv> so do you remember the two things I said to prove last time
[14:10:46] <riv> T is a subgroup of E_2
[14:10:52] <riv> O2(R) is a subgroup of E_2
[14:11:11] <riv> You want to show that you can swap around these elements
[14:11:25] <cadmio> one of those must be a normal subgroup, right?
[14:11:26] *** Joins: MajorBiscuit (~MajorBisc@62-52-102.netrun.cytanet.com.cy)
[14:11:29] <riv> given t,o   find t'  that satisfies  t o = o t'
[14:11:44] <riv> yes, T is the normal subgroup
[14:12:06] <riv> so try to prove that T is the normal subgroup
[14:12:38] <cadmio> so it should be E_2 = T x_phi O_2(R)
[14:12:55] <riv> yes, you can find phi later
[14:15:21] <Gurkenglas> Suppose I have a tensor x of shape 5,6. Tensors A,B of shape 5,8 and 6,9 representing functions of type R^5->R^8 and R^6->R^9. Then I can tensor-product together A and B to represent a function that'll map x to a tensor of shape 8,9. This all seems simple to me but I find it hard to connect to the notion of tensor products of vector spaces, to a quotient set of a formal linear combination of pairs of vectors.
[14:15:21] <Gurkenglas> Instead of saying that the space of tensors of shape 5,6 has anything to do with R^5 and R^6, I would say that taking a vector space V to V^(5*6) has a lot to do with ^5 and ^6. Can someone tell me what I'm missing?

[14:22:19] <Gurkenglas> johnkeats6, I haven't built an intuition for *. It sounds reasonable enough that Hom(V,W) contains exactly the information of how much each entry of V can impact each entry of W.
[14:22:19] <riv> what we are doing in a tensor product is making  a (x) (b + c)  equal to   a (x) b + a (x) c   and c on,

[14:28:07] <Gurkenglas> When I transport that intuition, the most straightforward way to try to represent Hom(V,W) with V(x)W would be to add up all the pairs (v,f(v)) and check that linearly dependent v don't contradict each other in that sum
[14:28:58] <riv> you dropped a *
[14:29:31] <Gurkenglas> I hear that the * ... doesn't do much of consequence?
[14:29:43] <riv> i think you can't just omit it :P
[14:30:01] <riv> im not sure personally about the dual/hom version
[14:30:05] <riv> not something i've used
[14:30:20] <Gurkenglas> It's supposed to map V to... V->R... it might help to consider another setting than vector spaces where * does something
[14:30:46] <riv> right so another key thing with tensor product, not too important here, is that it's over a base field
[14:30:51] <riv> so it's really a 3-ary operation

[14:31:15] <Gurkenglas> Makes sense, that you'd need to identify R to turn R^5 and R^6 into R^(5*6)
[14:31:40] <Gurkenglas> But still, why not instead just compose (^5) and (^6) into (^5*6)?
[14:32:43] <riv> well, you want to prove R^5 (x)_R R^6 ~= R^(5*6)

[14:34:40] <riv> so indeed we have R^a (x)_r R^b ~= R^(ab). Why is this true? well we know that the tensor product is the quotient of the direct product R^a x R^b, which is iso to R^(ab). But the thing is, in this special case the direct product is completely linear
[14:34:46] <riv> so we don't quotient anything out

[16:45:22] <cadmio> so we're trying to prove that T ∩ O_2(R) = {I}
[16:47:13] <OverCoder> I think (1) The coverage is consistent across the country since apparently the typical person gets the median 11 Mbps, but in some places it can go very much higher pushing the mean much higher
[16:47:51] <OverCoder> (2) The network could also be unstable enough that on days one can pull like 50 Mbps, but on a typical day it can be around 10 Mbps
[16:48:33] <OverCoder> (3) Observation (2) mean that the internet speed is subject to the changing random electricity availability in the country

[20:45:10] <jellie> so if I scale by a factor of 10, it was 5x5 it'll be 50x50
[20:46:56] <jellie> So a point on the 5x5 occupied 1/5 and I want it to occupy 1/5 of the new thing. What's the best way to do this?

[22:15:56] <isekaijin> Guest45: The only useful ring without identity that I ever ran into was Schwartz space.
[22:17:15] <isekaijin> Since rings without 1 are normally so useless, I don't mind using the long-winded epithet “semigroup objects in Ab” for them.
[22:17:31] <joel135> i guess a ring without a multiplicative identity is sort of like a LCCC (locally cartesian closed category), as opposed to one which also has a terminal object. not a close analogy but still

[23:23:32] <isekaijin> Because it's easy to see that, if R is the radius of convergence of the series, then the series will converge for |z - z_0| < R, and it will diverge for |z - z_0| > R.
[23:23:39] <isekaijin> Like, Cauchy ratio test.
[23:23:44] <isekaijin> From calculus.
[23:24:14] <[-_-]> right, but that kind of like too obvious, why would someone put that into a question?
[23:24:36] <[-_-]> also ratio test can't be performed here as value of a_n is not known
[23:24:49] <isekaijin> Wait, my bad.
[23:25:00] <isekaijin> I thought the question was “why does a Taylor series converge in a disk?”
[23:25:13] <isekaijin> I was answering that question.
[23:26:07] <[-_-]> oh...hmmm...right
[23:26:47] <[-_-]> Can I assume existance of taylor series while answering this? http://0x0.st/orsF.jpg
[23:26:52] <[-_-]> what do you think?
[23:27:18] <isekaijin> That question is short enough that you could have typed it here.
[23:27:29] <isekaijin> Anyhow.
[23:28:40] <isekaijin> A Laurent series converges only in an annular region because the truncated series for n >= 0 converges for |z - z_0| < R, for some R, and the truncated series for n < 0 converges for |z - z_0| > r, for some r.
[23:28:59] <isekaijin> So, if r < R, then you get the annular region r < |z - z_0| < R.
[23:29:07] <isekaijin> Again, it all boils down to the Cauchy ratio test.
[23:29:18] <isekaijin> i.e., calculus
[23:29:31] <bosspotato> (it might or might not converge at the boundary)
[23:29:43] <bosspotato> the ratio test is also slightly overkill
[23:30:20] <isekaijin> It's the quickest way to a proof. Who cares if it's logically the most efficient?
