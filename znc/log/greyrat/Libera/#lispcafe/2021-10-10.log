[04:03:32] <mfiano> build flags are fine...it's when you try to sell your build system with categories of flags (USE flags), That model is flawed in such a bad way, so you have overrides for your overrides for your....

[04:45:36] <mfiano> Hmm, ZFS doesn't interest me a whole great deal.
[04:47:01] <mfiano> It seems to favor reliability above all, and also geared towards multiple storage volumes. For me, I only have a single disk, and I run de-duplicated local network and 2 off-site backups via a cron job every hour.
[04:47:48] <mfiano> Given the amount of resources it requires for ZIL etc to handle the former, I don't know if I want to use it.
[04:48:06] <mfiano> I mean, it doesn't buy me much of anything...more of a cost.
[04:49:06] <mfiano> I would love to be convinced otherwise. I am unfamiliar with the BSD filesystem landscape.

[05:18:14] <Qwnavery> Then you probably won't need ZFS for a single drive.
[05:18:58] <Qwnavery> Seeing as you're using cron backups locally opposed to version controlled filesystem.

[05:32:37] <Qwnavery> thats basically what jails are. chroot with benefits.

[05:42:05] <Qwnavery> gilberth: and no, my CRT won't sync, I might be able to hack it if I learn more about DSP and Electrical Engineering. It's a portable PAL TV that some commodore videos made we want to get running.

[05:42:49] <Qwnavery> Sadly no.
[05:43:02] <gilberth> Oh, hard to debug then.
[05:43:08] * mfiano continues trying to install rakudo
[05:43:42] <Qwnavery> I have a rpi, a soldering iron, some lengths of random wires, some tiny resistors, a couple transistors, a capacitor and half a brain.
[05:44:34] <Qwnavery> I could go out and buy a VGA to RCA converter
[05:44:48] <gilberth> That would be cheating :-p
[05:45:11] <Qwnavery> or ham something together. Problem is I have the schematics, but not the resistors.
[05:45:38] <Qwnavery> the biggest resistor I have is 20 ohm ._.
[05:47:11] <Qwnavery> I could attempt to scavenge some resistors of motherboards and line them up in series, but they have higher melting point solder. :/
[05:47:39] <mfiano> you can easily make a resistor
[05:47:59] <gilberth> Won't help you, as that TV perhaps has no DVB-T tuner, but I found this impressive: https://bellard.org/dvbt/
[05:49:22] <Qwnavery> holy frick
[05:49:34] <Qwnavery> https://www.epanorama.net/circuits/vga2tv/composite_adapter.html this is what I was trying to do
[05:50:48] <Qwnavery> My TV has VHF
[05:51:09] <Qwnavery> like it has an arial reciever inbuilt
[05:51:37] <gilberth> The challange was to also modulate a DVB-T signal, which is sick.
[05:52:55] <gilberth> I mean, that is a QAM modulated MPEG stream.
[05:55:39] <gilberth> Qwnavery: On a first glance that circuit looks suspicious. Why are there different resistors for R, G, and B?
[05:57:00] <Qwnavery> gilberth: presumeably to provide a distinguishable difference between RGB in monochrome
[05:57:40] <Qwnavery> It's going into a composite signal.
[05:58:19] <Qwnavery> I don't have a DVB :(
[05:58:58] <Qwnavery> I wonder if it would be possible to hack a wifi card to do the same?
[06:01:42] <gilberth> This is forbidden in the EU. It's illegal to sell Wifi hardware that could be hacked.

[06:03:48] <Qwnavery> Yeah, I know. :( they have a bunch of hardware failsafes that will brick it if you try anything.
[06:04:14] <gilberth> Qwnavery: Yes, when you convert RGB to grayscale, you do it like the LUMINANCE function in <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/clx-pixel.lisp> This somewhat agrees, as blue contributes way less than green to the luminance.
[06:04:50] <gilberth> Qwnavery: It's about not being able to update the firmware.
[06:05:04] <Qwnavery> I've also read that they also have people drive around in vans in the city monitoring all the bands and will arrest you if you are on the wrong frequencies.
[06:05:31] <gilberth> Oh there is a type 18 instead of 8. Embarrassing.
[06:06:05] <gilberth> Qwnavery: It's not about that. Not primarily.
[06:06:32] <Qwnavery> What is it about?
[06:07:16] <mfiano> Right, the generally agreed upon standard is the ITU-R Recommendation BT.709
[06:07:30] <gilberth> To disallow free software on things that could transmit to the ether.
[06:08:07] <mfiano> Which is defined as (+ (* r 0.2126) (* g 0.7152) (* b 0.0722))
[06:08:22] <gilberth> At least this is the consequence, manufactures must make sure that the firmware cannot be replaced.
[06:09:09] <gilberth> mfinano: According to which gamma?
[06:09:36] <Qwnavery> Is the outside steel shell conductive i.e. ground?

[09:18:24] <hayley> Since...I don't think anyone has actually deployed a pauseless GC. The Pauseless and C4 papers say they have short enough pauses in some places, and Shenandoah, ZGC and the Go GC follow suit. Even though Pauseless and DLG can be done pauseless.
[09:19:46] <hayley> Despite the common knowledge that French people exist, IIRC Go made Dijkstra-Lamport's concurrent mark sweep work with multiple mutators by stopping the world.
[09:19:49] <dave0> hayley: i like your article about GC's once a year
[09:20:20] <moon-child> I guess you have to qualify pause more precisely.  A memory access could mean a 'pause' if you miss cache.  Scheduler could make you pause for a bit if somebody else is hogging cpu
[09:20:59] <moon-child> IOW, what exactly does 'pauseless' mean, and what 'short enough global pauses'?
[09:21:12] <hayley> I would define a "pause" to be a state transition in the GC which requires all threads to come to a halt, and none of the threads can continue until the GC has processed them all.
[09:27:24] <hayley> But I don't know how short a short enough pause would be. To be fair, most people don't. Just "the smaller the better".
[09:28:43] <moon-child> hmm.  In distributed systems the consensus seems to be that you choose 'eventual consistency', and maintain availability in all cases.  So one node in the network can be unavailable, but the others won't be.  But CPU interconnect is obviously different from network interconnect.  What about NUMA?  What about the POWER cpu mesh thingy where you hook up a bunch of CPUs to each other?  I don't think
[09:28:45] <moon-child> you can expect most people to have NUMA hardware, but maybe a numa-like architecture where you cluster cores together; all the cores in a cluster pause at the same time, but can communicate quickly; one cluster can run while another is paused, but it is more expensive to communicate between clusters (say, an object owned by another cluster always triggers a barrier)
[09:29:36] <hayley> I haven't considered NUMA yet. Hurts my head more.

[15:00:47] <hayley> Someone told me some of my articles had "cheap critiques" that were also absurd, because you could swap out one software name with another and get the same result.
[15:01:08] <hayley> I dunno, sounds like I nailed it more than it being "absurd" if it's that universal.
[15:19:03] <edgar-rft> yes, absurdity *is* universal
[15:19:50] * hayley re-reads the description of Pauseless in the GC handbook
[15:20:59] <hayley> Basically, when compacting, you simply cannot use pointers to objects that are being moved until all threads are ready to flip. Which makes sense, but it wasn't clear to me how you would avoid threads seeing both fromspace and tospace pointers.
[15:27:30] <hayley> There is also the possibility that you trap if you load from a reference you hold already, i.e. every read needs to be a "safepoint" now? You don't have to poll, but the register + stack map has to be there to flip from that point.
[15:29:03] <hayley> What happens if you trap there is that you flip to tospace and then wait for all other threads to checkpoint. But, on average, we expect that you don't trap as few pages are compacted in one go, and they are fragmented and thus have fewer objects in them.
[15:31:38] <hayley> The result is that whole machine sees a consistent view of fromspace/tospace, and so you can still do EQ with one instruction, which is handy.

[18:01:37] <gilberth> I definitly need more coffee. I wanted a corrected modmap for the my desktop, swappend () with [], and tried it on the laptop and were surprised, that it does nothing. I was forgetting that Karabiner (which does not work like this on the "new" machine) already swapped () and [] on the very keycode level, X11 then swapped it again!
[18:01:51] * selwyn hands gilberth a cup
[18:02:25] * gilberth sips and looks pretty tired with bad hair still.
[18:02:52] <gilberth> selwyn: [low voice] Thanks!
[18:04:37] <gilberth> This is why I want an USB adapter. Karabiner which stopped to work that way, modified the keycode stream at the very lowest level, so that this swap worked everywhere, be it Cocoa, X11, or in any OS within Parallels.
[18:05:39] <gilberth> When hitting "[" it would make the kernel see, <left-shift down> <9 down> <9 up> <left-shift up>
[18:07:39] <gilberth> And the inverse for <shift>+<9>
[18:13:51] <gilberth> Any bets, how long until I ditch macOS?
[18:17:11] <gilberth> However, the keyboard code of the CADR emulator is clever and would on itself insert needed shift-up and shift-downs for non-QWERTY maps.

[19:45:32] <pjb> Oh, so it's not an emacs problem…
[19:45:44] <pjb> Check your xmodmap.
[19:46:25] <pjb> Or, if you're on macOS with X11.app, don't have an xmodmap. I never could make it work correctly, the keycodes are all wrong.
[19:46:49] <pjb> X11.app doesn't simulate the keyboard correctly.
[19:46:59] <gilberth> ojb: I said: There is no, none, zero, zilch keyboard event arriving. It's not a modmap issue or sth. It's that this keystroke is eaten alive within the depth of macOS.
[19:47:19] <pjb> Well, WFM.
[19:47:56] <gilberth> pjb: I only used xev to outrule Emacs doing sth silly. My Cocoa CLIM doesn't see this keystroke either. I am not stupid.

[19:48:26] <gilberth> pjb: Have you read, what I have written?
[19:48:57] <gilberth> And, yes, I configured Emacs to use the right meta for level shifting.
[19:49:18] <pjb> Where did you configure capslock as control?  This is done in the System Preference / Keyboard.
[19:49:32] <pjb> / Modifiers Keys
[19:49:53] <pjb> And you need to do it for each physical keyboard.
[19:50:13] <gilberth> When I physically strike <capslock>+<left-alt>+<f> it's eaten. <left-control>+<left-meta>+<f> is not. Neither is <caps-lock>+<right-met>+<f>, but I need <right-meta> for accented chars.
[19:50:33] <gilberth> pjb: AGAIN! I AM NOT STUPID, MIND YOU.
[19:50:44] <pjb> Possibly, there's a command shortcut configured on this key somewhere else, then.
[19:50:59] <gilberth> All other c-m-<anything> work fine. With <capslock> as control.

[23:02:42] <gilberth> I wonder how local package nicknames will alter naming conventions. Without them, it was polite not have short possibly colliding nicknames, and rather go by the com.example.frob convention and since it would be tedious you usually would :use such a package, calling for collision non short symbol names again, so it won't be, say, CREATE but FROB-CREATE, that is adding a prefix again, which won't be needed because of packages.
[23:03:05] <gilberth> Now packages could have a long name and a using package could call the COM.EXAMPLE.FROB just FROB. That API entry then could be just CREATE, refered to by FROB:CREATE, instead of the tedious COM.EXAMPLE.FROB:CREATE. I came across this, because I would like to name my package DE.BAUHH.CHAOS and have a CLOSE function making it impractical to :USE that package, now you could go by CHAOS:CLOSE without me clobbering the CHAOS package [nick] n
[23:06:34] <gilberth> I wonder what did take so long, as Zeta-Lisp already had this feature what we call local nicknames.
