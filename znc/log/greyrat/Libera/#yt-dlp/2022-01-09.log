[04:34:25] <JackFrost> pabs3: ...You contribute to yt-dlp, do you want to correct all onions for v3 addresses? :P  grep says https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#L321 and https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/extractor/pornhub.py#L35 are the only ones left, for the former https://docs.invidious.io/Invidious-Instances.md / https://solmu.org/pub/misc/invidio.html seems to list, 
[04:34:25] <JackFrost> and for the latter it seems to be pornhubvybmsymdol4iibwgwtkpwmeyd6luq2gxajgjzfjvotyt5zhyd.onion
[04:52:22] <pabs3> not today, other stuff to do
[04:52:52] <JackFrost> I imagine your todo is about a mile long.
[04:53:10] <pabs3> (also probably not at all, I generally don't download video from any onions)
[04:53:34] <pabs3> yeah, even just my URL visiting TODO is very long
