[08:26:07] <Fieldy> hi, i have the entire stack working and filebeat working in a basic mode where it is sending logs to logstash. i'd like to use the iptables filebeat module, however, running filebeat modules list as per this page shows no modules available and none enabled. am I missing something? https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html

[13:12:46] <colo_work> hi
[13:15:30] <colo_work> we index documents into ES that sometimes have variants (or versions) of their own in the source corpus. we would like to use an application-computed ID to establish document identity, but when ES processes the document, we would like it to append/add all not-already-present data in the document to the variant already stored in the index. can ES do that on its own somehow, or will we have to implement application logic for 
[13:15:30] <colo_work> that?
[13:30:48] <colo_work> upserting via the Update API seems to be or at least come close to what we need

[23:16:20] <Fieldy> hello, i'm trying to use the iptables filebeat module. of note is that no modules came with my distro, so I found them on github and placed them where they are expected. I followed these instructions: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-iptables.html however it does not seem to be working. I am not seeing the new fields listed here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/exported-fields-iptables.html   
[23:16:20] <Fieldy> any idea what i'm missing?

[23:20:38] <Fieldy> might have found the issue or at least part of it; i'm new at all of this and so thought all logs would come through logstash. but it seems like these by default connect directly to ES. i'll mess around
