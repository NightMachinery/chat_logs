[03:54:24] <Bugz000> the one on libera is definitely dead... plenty users but *crickets*
[03:56:17] <PMT> I should point out that /topic on libera's #openwrt links you to openwrt.org/irc, which tells you to go to OFTC.
[03:58:15] <Bugz000> i rarely read topics, they are abused for the most part with a long string of unhelpful stuff intended to "lighten the mood" ... much like corporate motivational posters that somehow blend in with a white wall...

[05:00:40] <urk> Can someone provide some guidance on creating a Linux partition on a USB memory stick using fdisk?   I am using a Sandisk USB memory device, deleted all of the partitions, but fdisk doesn't seem to give me the option of selecting ext4. IT just gives me the option of creating a partition.  After checking that with the "F" command, I still get FAT32 which is what I am trying to get rid of.

[05:02:33] <Hash> just make the partition using fdisk
[05:02:38] <urk> PMT:  NOt sure what you mean.  Currently the USB is /dev/sda1
[05:02:38] <Hash> then use mkfs.ext4
[05:02:54] <urk> Hash:  thanks
[05:02:59] <Hash> First make sda1 how big you want. Then write the partition table in fdisk. thene exist fdisk.
[05:03:14] <Hash> Then use mkfs.ext4 (use man page) to format the partition
[05:03:17] <urk> For some reason I thought the fdisk command had that utility in it, but apparently it doesn't.
[05:03:26] <Hash> You can also use a graphical tool like Gparted if that makes it easier for you
[05:03:38] <Hash> Unless you're stuck on cli, fdisk, use gparted.

[12:50:36] <Khepra> shtrb: I believe so. nvidia doesn't speak vaapi afaik
[12:50:49] <shtrb> Thanks Khepra 
[12:51:56] <Khepra> except maybe nouveau? the proprietary driver doesn't, at least
[12:52:44] <shtrb> thanks 
[12:53:13] <Khepra> but oyu know what, maybe you should dig deeper than what the general readmes and wikis tell. for example, for years nvidia-driver (proprietary) couldn't work with wayland; or to be precise, compositors like gnome couldn't work on nvidia. now it appears that gnome's mutter CAN do wayland with nvidia drivers. something something eglstreams.
[12:53:39] *** Joins: mcope (~matt@user/mcope)
[12:54:08] <Khepra> my point being, stuff changes faster than it's documented, so I could be wrong about vaapi too. however, from personal experience, on buster at least, mesa-va-drivers had no vaapi interaction with nvidia whatsoever, FF had no hw acceleration.
[12:58:21] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[12:58:35] <willow> shtrb: why not set to auto acceleration?
[13:01:00] <willow> it should be smart enough to choose the best method
[13:01:23] <shtrb> willow, https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=yes&bug=813370#43 
[13:01:42] <Khepra> well question is if vlc is linked against nvidia-vdpau-driver and can use it
[13:02:01] <shtrb> Khepra, that wast fast :)
[13:02:42] <shtrb> Khepra, I guess it's not (because I remember that you need to rebuild ffmpeg to have support for the nveencode in buster)
[13:03:08] <Khepra> I know about that part because I was fighting no hwaccel in Firefox on nvidia. I fixed it by switching to amdgpu :))  I kid you not.  I'm now fully enjoying tear-free videos, games, and full accel in stuff built against vaapi.
[13:04:43] <Khepra> shtrb: it appears vlc DOES pull in vdpau stuff
[13:04:54] <Khepra> (I didn't look beyond apt install -s)
[13:05:21] <shtrb> Khepra, you switch to a different gpu just for that ?!
[13:05:29] <willow> vlc --list-verbose | grep -i vdpau
[13:05:38] <Khepra> more than just that, but BS linux support on nvidia in general was the reason

[15:24:51] <jaguart> khepra: do all your log analysers still work?
[15:28:39] <Khepra> yeah, the formats seem different. tools designed for (r)syslog don't seem to work ootb with journald. two primary problems being apparmor audit trails and fail2ban triggers. I otherwise use no analyzers except for dedicated work which require proper logfiles.
[15:28:56] <Khepra> the only exception is a custom error log monitor that I integrated with journald.

[15:29:58] <Khepra> _however_ ... I use journald only in very special situations. most of the servers use journald as a thin, 100MB volatile (in-memory) buffer and I rely on rsyslog to do all the work: remote to a central log server, and the log server then uses various rules to separate into individual files
[15:30:52] <jaguart> ok cool - so you havent actually purged rsyslog everywhere?
[15:31:11] *** Joins: Romukas (~Romukas@85.206.78.142)
[15:31:15] <Khepra> nope and I doubt I ever will unless journald grows the same capabilities: rules to differentiate outputs into text filess
[15:31:49] <Khepra> journald has advantages, like indexed searches with the journalctl interface, but beyond that? I prefer syslog'd textfiles hierarchy
[15:32:29] <Khepra> bullseye's decision to go journald only is regression imho. but hey, it's just a default, easy to revert.

[18:27:27] <jelly> "native" means you're basically going to use Debian to publish your releases.  People usually don't want that, even when they're authors or current maintainers, but if you want to, that's the thing lintian is complaining about.

[20:08:15] <Khepra> linux is quite capable of scheduling more tasks than there's computational units. cores pegged at "100%" doesn't mean anything

[20:13:09] <Khepra> in _general_ which core is running which process doesn't matter, unless you're worried with cache invalidation, but that's entirely different story.
[20:13:35] <Khepra> a kthread getting into D state because IO is bad, can hang everything else, regardless of cpu usage
[20:14:53] *** Quits: srv (~cmd@user/srv) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:15:14] <Khepra> the only area where scheduling affinity might matter is _smoothness_ of UI experience if, for example, your system is running much more tasks than there's available computational  units so context switching overhead and inability to break out of critical sections (eg. "only" voluntary-preemptible kernel, which is debian default) is shown in stuttery or hung UI.

[20:16:41] <Khepra> Haohmaru: it depends. something like gnome with javascripted UI, that requries ton of computation just to redraw something might be extra sensible to that

Is there a way to make it fail with out coding around it?

[21:18:10] <n-iCe> never had problems but with this new laptop the wifi was not detected
[21:18:18] <sney> for instance the broadcom b43 series can only be distributed by broadcom, so it's not on the firmware iso

[21:34:43] <n-iCe> Sney yes it's missing in the installer
[21:35:01] <PMT> i would expect the reason the debs are on the netinst iso is to be unpacked in the installer, really - otherwise you could just fetch them from nonfree.
[21:35:39] <sney> the firmware installer usually/previously just had the linux-firmware tree unpacked to /lib/firmware, to support the largest range of devices during the install 
[21:35:58] <PMT> presently, it does not appear to be the case that that is true.
[21:36:05] <sney> you can't "just fetch" a network driver from non-free if you need it to even reach a repository, of course 
[21:36:12] <PMT> yes, that's my point.

[21:36:50] <n-iCe> This never happened to me.
[21:37:22] <PMT> sney: at least back to debian 9 they still just had the debs on the iso
[21:37:27] <jelly> the simpler thing to do is use the installed with firmware, instead of using normal installer and then adding firmware after the fact
[21:37:45] <jelly> the installer* image* with firmware already on it
[21:37:50] <sney> you could probably manually unpack the firmware-atheros deb to /lib/firmware in the installer, and then reload the ath10k driver, though this is not a trivial task
[21:37:50] <PMT> jelly: ...they're using it.
[21:37:54] <jelly> oh
[21:37:54] <PMT> that's kind of the point.
[21:38:24] <jelly> I probably should have scrolled back smore.
[21:38:58] <sney> PMT: sure, the debs are on the disk so they can be installed in the finished system, but the *firmware* is also supposed to be in the installer's live environment so that the netinst can actually install debian. so I can boot my T430 from that iso and have iwlwifi work, well before anything is installed anywhere.

[21:40:37] <PMT> sney: my point is that the firmware appears to have been distributed solely like that for at least a couple of releases.

[21:45:08] <sney> the point of using CD or DVD 1 is that it has the OS on the disc, so you don't need a network connection during the install process, and then you can keep the firmware deb on a usb stick and install it to the debian system afterwards 
[21:45:30] <PMT> n-iCe: you seem to be misunderstanding. this is a bug. the firmware is on the disc, and supposed to load on its own. the fact that it is not is a flaw.

[22:04:39] <n-iCe> If I boot debian live again I see in my ssd the system installed
[22:04:46] <n-iCe> And in my HDD my backups files
[22:04:50] <sney> most laptops will let you press F12 or F9 or something to get a boot menu. check your laptop's manual if you aren't sure what it is. 
[22:04:52] <n-iCe> But system is not booting

[22:08:16] <mrfb> another way to check is the partition layout, if it's MBR or GPT
[22:09:12] <sney> n-iCe: since the install was so fast, I think you should disable legacy mode to be *sure* that you are installing in uefi, and then do the install again
[22:09:33] <sney> and make sure to pay close attention to any questions it asks during the bootloader section
[22:10:00] <n-iCe> It did not ask a thing.
[22:10:20] <n-iCe> It's was so fast I guess because it's good hardware i7 8th gen, 16ram ssd etc
[22:10:28] <greycat> I might be remembering wrong, or it might have changed in bullseye (which I haven't installed yet), but I believe the installer used to say UEFI or Legacy somewhere at the top of the screen, early in the process.
