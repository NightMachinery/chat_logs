[00:00:42] <alismanickt> crowbar: yeah
[00:05:10] <crowbar> i had problems using auth-source-search at first because it returns a p-list.  I'm assuming your password-store-get returns an actual string?
[00:06:21] <crowbar> or just delete your entire config and try using the sasl example.  
[00:07:39] <alismanickt> crowbar: It does return a string
[00:07:44] <alismanickt> and the sasl example didn't work
[00:09:13] <crowbar> got a \ in your password?
[00:19:35] <wasamasa> why is there not a backquote
[00:19:49] <wasamasa> emacs doesn't magically know what you meant to quote and not quote

[11:25:47] <jdz> talismanick: If you have not solved your issue â€” what wasamasa was telling you is that your configuration is quoted (i.e., constant).  Instead of quote you want a backquote, and the forms that need to be evaluated need to have a comma before them.  https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backquote.html
[11:26:48] <talismanick> jdz: Oh, duh
[11:27:21] <talismanick> I mindlessly slapped in the (concat ...) call and other edits to the default config without checking if the whole thing was quote
[11:27:23] <talismanick> quoted*
[11:29:01] <talismanick> thanks
[11:30:10] <talismanick> jdz: Also, I don't recall seeing wasamasa. I've been restarting my Emacs all day, for various reasons
[11:30:30] <talismanick> Well, not to mention the client itself
[11:30:35] <talismanick> Speaking of which

[11:41:45] <alismanickt> As you can see, it didn't pan out
[11:42:18] <alismanickt> I feel like Wile E Coyote, with the blackened face after the ACME dynamite blows up in his face for the n'th time
[11:42:28] * alismanickt sighs
[12:26:35] <jdz> I can suggest to start ielm (M-x ielm), and evaluate your backquoted configuration form there to see it is as you expect it to be.

[23:55:48] <acdw> hello, so i have an issue. if i set `circe-format-say' et al. with a function taking the plist, `circe-nick-color' doesn't work. i guess it's a properties thing? any idea what it might be
[23:57:01] <acdw> for reference my config setting circe-format ... is here:
