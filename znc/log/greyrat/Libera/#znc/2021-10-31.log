[21:32:31] <MetaNova> gera: alternatively, if you wish to keep AutoClearQueryBuffer disabled, you can create a client alias to do both: "/msg *status clearbuffer %c" then "/close %c" (assuming %c is your client's variable for "current window")
[21:33:26] <gera> ok, ty
[21:33:39] <MetaNova> name it cc or something (for 'clear and close') and then just do /cc in any query window you don't want to see again
[21:36:14] <MetaNova> this isn't necessary for channels because ZNC clears the buffer if a channel is parted, I think
[21:37:01] <MetaNova> I don't use persistent buffers so I'm not sure about that, but I think channel buffers are cleared on part
[21:37:19] <MetaNova> (there's no way to "part" a query)
[21:38:39] <MetaNova> gera: as yet another alternative, [[Clearbufferonmsg]] might prove useful, depending on your use case
[21:38:39] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Clearbufferonmsg
[21:39:18] <gera> what does AutoClearQueryBuffer do? how does it know i close a query?
[21:41:09] <MetaNova> when AutoClearQueryBuffer is true, no query buffer is retained after it is shown to you, so private messages sent from one nick to you are either relayed directly if there is a client attached, or cached and played back once and then discarded when a client does eventually attach
[21:43:06] <MetaNova> AutoClearChanBuffer is similar, when true, it displays any existing channel buffer and then purges it, when false, always retains the channel cache no matter how many times it is displayed
[21:43:31] <MetaNova> unless the channel is parted, which clears it
[21:44:57] <gera> since i use 2 devices i guess it's better to use Clearbufferonmsg
[21:45:37] <MetaNova> perhaps
[21:45:40] <MetaNova> but be careful
[21:46:02] <MetaNova> the wording of the https://wiki.znc.in/Clearbufferonmsg page has it, "This module clears all buffers when it sees a user-originated message"
[21:46:13] <gera> how would it behave with bots that always reply? will their last medsage be preserved?
[21:47:27] <gera> bots i mean like *status or nickserv
[21:47:38] <MetaNova> well, no *status messages are cached
[21:47:59] <MetaNova> and nickserv responds via notice
[21:48:16] <MetaNova> I'm not positive how notices are cached
