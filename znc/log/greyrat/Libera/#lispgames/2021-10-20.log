[05:08:03] <GreaseMonkey> every song in milkytracker is awful. it saves to XM. that is a truly awful format.
[05:10:53] <GreaseMonkey> the specification for the XM format is "whatever FastTracker 2 does", which sometimes includes opening part of the About dialogue on certain kinds of invalid input

[13:50:49] <pjb> technomancy: beware. things written in C, sometimes are not written in C.  Instead, they're written in a high level programming language in the mind of the programmer, who then compile it to C.  You think you see a C source, while you actually see a lisp object or a modula-2 objectâ€¦

[21:15:04] <dthompson> this jam has been fun. first time I've made all of the assets for the game. original art and music. yeah it sucks but that's alright :)
[21:15:38] <thrig> e e e c, d d d b. you heard it here first
[21:16:47] <dthompson> I used the most basic scales and chords and the track just loops the same short thing but that's aaaaalright
[21:16:59] <dthompson> no time for good stuff, this is a jam
[22:22:18] <dto> yo dthompson 
[22:23:05] <dto> did i tell you about my plan to acquire a new Atari VCS 800 system and port my game engine to it
[22:23:19] <dto> and then make Ultimate Squareball 
[22:23:47] <dto> as a test pilot thing. then , the reboot of 2x0ng will be called Squareball Quest
[22:24:22] <dto> and of course i can share all the dev recipes thereby
[22:24:35] <dto> for atari. including probably a binding lib to auto map the controllers etc

[22:44:07] <dthompson> dto: whoa no you didn't tell me
[22:44:41] <dto> yeah!
[22:44:54] <dto> i want to work with a cool company that puts music into games
[22:45:10] <dto> for the nonfree version
[22:45:24] <dto> the free version will prob have no music just allowing you to put whatever you want on media player / spotify
[22:46:11] <dto> there would only be a nonfree version if atari wants to put it in the store. 
[22:46:25] <dto> and of course the whohle thing is GPL
[22:46:31] <dto> er, LGPL
[22:47:16] <dto> a friend is coming over now, but i'll keep you posted
