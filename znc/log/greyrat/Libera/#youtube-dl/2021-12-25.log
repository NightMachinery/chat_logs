[05:14:30] <pabs3> teke339: youtube-dl itself is client-side AFAIK
[05:14:52] <pabs3> there are GUIs for youtube-dl if that is what you are asking
[05:15:16] <teke339> sorrz i meant if it was clientside without installing... (js)

[05:54:01] <WishBoy> teke339 you need to rephrase your question better, maybe English is not your native language, use Google translator, it's difficult to understand your need.
[05:58:12] <teke339> âok the Idea is quite simple: I want to host a website, that would need to download and process youtube-videos... I've tried hosting ytdl on the server which had google ban my IP. So the Website User would have to download the video themselves
[05:58:35] <teke339> this is, afaik, not possible unless they install youtube-dl 
[06:02:23] <teke339> to clarify: limit exceeded. ytdl only works for a "normal" amount
[06:05:34] <WishBoy> there are only two options, your site downloads the video and then the client downloads from your server (not very used by what I see, uses a lot of server processing and demands more servers for that), another option, write code that finds the YouTube download link for the video and show the person the result of the URL found for him to click the right mouse button and click save, but 
[06:05:34] <WishBoy> some videos are separated from the audio, it needs to show the user what is already mixed
[06:06:31] <teke339> there would also be postprocessing of the downloaded video
[06:06:54] <WishBoy> for audio and video mixing, ffmpeg is used, some applications have ffmpeg inside them, like aTube (I guess)
[06:07:22] <teke339> i need to split the video into frames
[06:08:04] <teke339> if you know how to get single frames from a yt vid without downloading it; that would be astonishing
[06:08:31] <teke339> *if anyone here
[06:08:48] <pabs3> should be doable after downloading easily. if you can't download any part of the video you can't get any frames
[06:09:41] <teke339> yes on my server it's easy. then it's high cpu load and paid proxies though.
[06:10:32] <teke339> any possibility without downloading? youtube iframe and skip and screenshot ... 
[06:10:41] <teke339> I'm lost
[06:13:06] <pabs3> well the youtube official website lets you see small screenshots of each frame of the video, so that could be possible, but I doubt they would allow full-resolution
[06:13:38] <pabs3> reverse engineering enough of the website to access that screenshot API would be hard though
[06:14:34] <pabs3> personally, I'd just get people to download a yt-dlp gui and leave it to them to do what they want client-side

[07:12:22] <pabs3> should be fine to just use existing yt-dlp GUIs on libre mobile platforms, no idea about mainstream mobile, I assume Python is a thing on those though, so might be doable, or you might need to rewrite the GUIs depending on what they use
