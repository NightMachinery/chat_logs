[05:23:54] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Have you used SQL before?
[05:25:00] <isekaijin> Your pullback is “select * from A, B where A.f = B.g”.
[05:25:37] <isekaijin> So, you see, pullbacks in the category of finite sets are already used on a daily basis by programmers.

[05:26:12] <Fangs> [itchyjunk]: pullbacks in alg top is 'basically' the same thing as what you do on Set
[05:28:35] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: Pullback bundles aren't that difficult to understand, but IMO you shouldn't go out of your way to learn what a fiber bundle is, just to make sense of this particular example (pullback of a fiber bundle).

[05:34:33] <[itchyjunk]> woha
[05:34:40] <[itchyjunk]> an sql example, so unexpected
[05:34:44] <Vornotron> that sounds like a kind of thing that would be useful in geometry though I suppose in that case we usually have inverses anyway, so it'd just be stuff like "what's g^-1 o f(A) vs B"
[05:35:07] <isekaijin> Mmm, for me, a pullback is, “We have a function f : X -> Y and some information attached to Y. What is the best way to transport this information to X along f?” For example, if we have a vector bundle p : E -> Y, we want a vector bundle f^*(p) : f^*(E) -> Y whose fiber over every x \in X is naturally identified with the fiber of p over f(y).
[05:35:16] <isekaijin> Errr
[05:35:24] <isekaijin> f^(p) : f^*(E) -> X, my bad.
[05:35:31] <isekaijin> f^*(p) : f^*(E) -> X, my bad.
[05:36:26] <blei86> sounds pretty vague

[05:38:47] <blei86> that sounds like inverse modeling
[05:39:00] <[itchyjunk]> now how are we getting a map from f^*(E) to X ?
[05:39:09] <[itchyjunk]> f^*(E) is subset of X?
[05:39:41] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: f^*(E) = { (x,e) \in X x E | f(x) = p(e) }.
[05:40:02] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: So the projection f^*(p) : f^*(E) -> X just discards “e” and retains “x”.
[05:40:21] <isekaijin> It's exactly the same as in the SQL example.
[05:41:08] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[05:41:42] <isekaijin> And it's easy to see that the points of f^*(E) that project to “x” are precisely the pairs (x,e), where e is a point of E that projects to f(x).
[05:42:19] <isekaijin> In other words, naturally identified with the fiber of p : E -> Y over f(x).
[05:42:40] <blei86> in the SQL example you assume the elements of the objects are known

[09:11:18] <Cale> I rather like the 5:3 polyrhythm, I can kind of understand how the 7:5 polyrhythm is a bit harder to make sense of though.
[09:14:24] <Fangs> something thats kinda interesting about polyrythm. apparently most people don't really try to 'get' the rythm and more less develop a muscle memory for it
[09:16:08] <Fangs> "pass the god damn butter" is a classic example on how you'd emphasize 4:3
[09:18:46] <Cale> ski: The tritone in 12 equal divisions of the octave is sqrt(2), but in some other meantone temperaments, especially quarter-comma meantone or 31 equal divisions of the octave, three tones makes a good approximation of 7/5 (and it's often justly tuned that way). A nice way to think about *that* interval is that if you take the 5/4 major third, and compose it with a 7/5 tritone, you get (7/5)(5/4) = 7/4, which is an
[09:18:47] <Cale> octave of the seventh harmonic of your root

[09:23:10] <Cale> Two 9/8 whole tones gets you to 5/4 (because the syntonic comma 81/80 is tempered, which means that it's in the kernel of the Z-module homomorphism from the positive rationals to the integers which tells you how to get to each just ratio)

[09:54:14] <Cale> 22 equal, whose accuracy is overall slightly better than 12 equal, sort of does the opposite of tempering out the syntonic comma. Where the meantone systems slightly flatten the 3/2 perfect fifth in order to make that equation work out, 22 equal has a very slightly sharp perfect fifth. So while the perfect fifth itself is good, by the time you climb up the circle of fifths from C to E, the error accumulates, and you're
[09:54:14] <Cale> a little over a quarter tone sharp (about half of which comes from the fact that (3/2)^4 is not literally equal to 5)

[12:49:19] <river> hiya :)
[12:49:26] <kakuhen> I have a non-empty closed subset A of R^n such that x,y\in A implies (x+y)/2\in A. I want to show A is path-connected, but I'm not sure where I would start for this
[12:49:46] <kakuhen> My first issue is that it's not obvious how I'd define a continuous function connecting x and y
[12:50:12] *** Quits: audiobirb (~audio@user/audio) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:50:29] <river> kakuhen: I think you can use this lemma:  A subset A ⊆ R is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded
[12:51:04] <river> I believe the compactness allows you to show that the straight line from x to y has all points on it, not just the halfs and quarters and so on
[12:51:24] <kakuhen> hm... so your suggestion is to show A is bounded then, right? so I can  apply Heine-Borel
[12:51:44] <river> I don't think A needs to be bounded, just some subset containing x and y
[12:52:09] <river> ah this is called Heine-Borel, I had completely forgot. thanks!

[13:13:45] <cadmio> if x is irreducible, then (x) is maximal and by the theorem R[x]/(x) is a field
[13:13:51] <Franciman> x is irreducible
[13:14:00] <Franciman> R[x]/(x) is isomorphic to R
[13:14:11] <Franciman> you can show this by this surjective map:

[14:27:02] <cadmio> my original question was whether I is a proper ideal of R
[14:27:27] <PlanckWalk> Was that for the case R/I being a field?
[14:28:04] <cadmio> yes
[14:28:09] <PlanckWalk> Then yes, it is
[14:28:33] <cadmio> why?
[14:28:44] <PlanckWalk> Fields (in most definitions) require 0 != 1
[14:29:12] <cadmio> and?
[14:29:27] <PlanckWalk> And if I is not a proper ideal then R/IU has only 1 element.

[14:31:34] <PlanckWalk> Why on Earth would you conclude that I = {0}?
[14:31:36] <Fangs> so when you ask if "I is a proper ideal of R" do you think there's only two ideals in R?

[19:27:52] <isekaijin> Consider the following bicategories. (a) The only object is a commutative ring R. 1-morphisms are R-modules. 2-morphisms are R-homomorphisms. (b) Objects are not necessarily commutative rings. 1-morphisms are bimodules. 2-morphisms are bimodule homomorphisms.
[19:28:10] <isekaijin> I think there's an analogy between these and (a) scalars, (b) matrices.
[19:28:47] <isekaijin> For example, you can add or multiply any two scalars. And you can also take direct sums or tensor products of arbitrary R-modules (commutativity of R is key here).
[19:29:31] <isekaijin> But you can only add two matrices if they have the same dimensions. And you can only take direct sums of bimodules if they are bimodules over the same rings.
[19:30:43] <isekaijin> Also, you can only multiply matrices (take tensor products of bimodules) if they have compatible dimensions (are bimodules over compatible pairs of rings).

[19:36:14] <isekaijin> Abbreviate q = p^(k-1). If A has entries in Z/qZ, then *all* of pA's entries are noninvertible in Z/qZ

[20:47:30] <yamchah2> In R3 if I have a player location, the direction they are looking at and the location of the enemy, how can I decide if the enemy is behind or in front of the character. Additionally if they are to the right or left of the player (based on where the player is looking I suppose). I am bad at linear algebra :(
[20:48:05] <int-e> bildramer: Yeah, just bet all your tokens at 0.97/3 odds.
[20:48:38] <bildramer> behind or front is easy: take the dot product of (enemy location - player location) and the look direction. if it's positive, it's in front of you
[20:50:00] <yamchah2> Because the dot product is related to the angles between the 2 vectors right?
[20:50:01] <bildramer> assuming z axis is up, 1. take the cross product of the look direction and (0,0,1), and 2. use dot product of (enemy location - player location) and the new direction. if positive, it's to the right
[20:50:11] <bildramer> yup
[20:50:36] <yamchah2> I know the cross product results in a orthogonal vector
[20:51:04] <bildramer> ok hang on, actually it depends on if your coordinate system is left-handed or right-handed, and if I did my mental math right. if your right-left result is incorrect, it's opposite
[20:52:01] <bildramer> yeah. extend your thumb and two fingers. thumb in look direction, pointer finger up, then the result is to the right
[20:52:10] <bildramer> (if you use your right hand)

[23:04:51] <isekaijin> biberao: If you don't have a definition, at least you should have a list of properties that you can take for granted.
[23:04:53] <Z-module> biberao: you can't even START this problem until you have a specific defnition of ln fixed.
[23:05:10] <biberao> isekaijin: i havent reached that part either

[23:05:27] <isekaijin> I think this settles it.
[23:05:33] <Z-module> biberao: then I repeat my comment about professoricide.
[23:05:36] <farn> quartz: or maybe being in all of them at the same time. I don't quite remember how this was framed. but basically if you're in state B then you _could_ be in state 8, in which case b would take you to 9
[23:06:07] <isekaijin> biberao: Your problem can't be solved until you have at least some properties of ln that you can use.

[23:06:21] <isekaijin> Too bad this is probably not the kind of answer you want, though.
[23:06:51] <biberao> isekaijin: tell me other definitions of ln then
[23:07:01] *** Joins: wakeup (~wakeup@user/wakeup)
[23:07:14] <isekaijin> Actually, the one that I gave is the only one that I know.
[23:07:23] <isekaijin> I haven't bothered looking for other ones, since that one works and solves my needs.
[23:07:26] <Z-module> The single most relevant thing about transitioning from handwavy high-school "math" to actual math is nailing down *precise* definitions.
[23:07:28] <quartz> farn: OK thanks.
[23:07:30] <enoq> I suppose negative exponents are defined because their properties work well in equations
[23:07:51] <isekaijin> enoq: Yes, the key property that you want is that a^(x + y) = a^x * a^y.
[23:07:55] <biberao> Z-module: i dont know :(
[23:08:07] <biberao> so you guys can teach me some basics then?
[23:08:11] <enoq> ah I see :)

[23:08:35] <isekaijin> In particular, for y = -x, we have 1 = a^0 = a^(x - x) = a^x * a^(-x).
[23:08:48] <isekaijin> Therefore, a^(-x) = 1 / a^x.

[23:10:52] <isekaijin> biberao: We could teach you the “basics” all you want, but an important question here is what you need it for. If you're taking a course, then your instructor probably wants you to use only stuff that he or she has taught you.
[23:11:04] <biberao> i dont have a teacher
[23:11:09] <biberao> im studying alone
[23:11:11] <isekaijin> Oh.
[23:11:49] <isekaijin> In that case, then just learn derivatives and integrals before trying to solve this particular problem.
[23:11:56] <Z-module> What isekaijin said.
[23:12:30] <Z-module> log and exp are *fundamentally* a calculus topic.
[23:13:04] <isekaijin> If you don't have a definition of ln, then of course you can't solve problems that need a definition / properties of ln.
[23:13:32] <isekaijin> It's like trying to cook a meal without having the ingredients first.
[23:13:41] <biberao> but here
[23:13:47] <biberao> they dont teach integrals generally
[23:13:51] <Z-module> even though we can do wacky stuff like define   e^x = lim_{n=1,2,3,...} (1 + x/n)^n   and then ln = inverse fucntion of e^x.  It's possible but highly unenlightening.
[23:14:14] <biberao> like they dont do that stuff here
[23:14:17] <biberao> atleast not yet
[23:14:33] <isekaijin> Z-module: To use that definition to solve biberao 's original problem, we would basically have to prove that it's equivalent to the definition I gave.
[23:14:44] <Z-module> right
[23:14:49] <isekaijin> biberao: What do you mean by “do that stuff here”? I thought you were studying alone.
[23:14:55] <isekaijin> If you're studying alone, then you can do whatever you want.

[23:16:03] <biberao> sorry
[23:16:57] <Z-module> Its title is surely "Higher Math, from the Burn-This-Absurd-Book-Now Viewpoint"

[23:17:22] <biberao> isekaijin: do you understand portuguese
[23:17:25] <biberao> i can share them
[23:17:39] <isekaijin> biberao: I can read Portuguese just fine. I've had to read books by Brazilian authors on holomorphic foliations.
[23:17:45] <biberao> ok
[23:17:51] <biberao> can i send the books to you then
[23:17:53] <biberao> ?
[23:18:06] <biberao> can you croc?
[23:18:14] <isekaijin> Mmm. I'd have to create a throwaway email account... too troublesome.
[23:18:17] <isekaijin> But just give me the title.
