[20:02:48] <Klinda> as I can see deep learning handle neural nets with 5 more layers
[20:03:07] <Klinda> it's just a more compliacted thing, is deepL now state of the art?
[20:03:29] <[itchyjunk]> deep neural net is stat of art for neural net
[20:03:46] <[itchyjunk]> not everything ML is neural nets
[20:04:07] <Klinda> but for most things neural nets are used
[20:04:18] <[itchyjunk]> no
[20:04:29] <[itchyjunk]> most things in actual productions aren't nn
[20:05:07] <[itchyjunk]> most commonly used ML is probably decision trees
[20:10:41] <HuntsMan> that is very hard to prove :)\
[20:14:13] <[itchyjunk]> Not really, lot of large companies like investment institutions, sales service provider, QI etc talk about the type of models they use

[20:15:46] <[itchyjunk]> kaggle does competitions all the time and they talk about non NN winners and such.
[20:16:12] <[itchyjunk]> It's hard to prove with absolute certainty but there is enough data to suggest not everything ML is NN's
[20:16:21] <[itchyjunk]> in deployment
[20:16:31] <[itchyjunk]> maybe acedemia is all NN but that is understandable
[20:16:34] <HuntsMan> [itchyjunk]: sure but that does not say much, you need to weight by size, google uses a lot of NNs, FAANG probably also uses a lot of them
[20:16:54] <[itchyjunk]> 10 companies using NN doesn't make NN most used
[20:16:59] <[itchyjunk]> ML is used in a lot of places
[20:17:16] <HuntsMan> no, but it undermines your argument
[20:17:21] <[itchyjunk]> even check recog in some banking chains don't use NN's
[20:17:30] <[itchyjunk]> It doesn't.
[20:17:44] <HuntsMan> those are legacy systems, here in Europe we do not use checks :)
[20:17:47] <[itchyjunk]> Claiming something else exists doesn't undermine the claim that something else might be major.
[20:17:57] <[itchyjunk]> Most of the world uses checks.
[20:18:08] <[itchyjunk]> parts of EU not using checks doesn't make it major, in the same sense
[20:19:53] <HuntsMan> most of the world? How would you know?
[20:20:02] <HuntsMan> are there statistics?

[20:47:34] <[itchyjunk]> Klinda, yeah in that sense it probably is all ensamble
[20:49:01] <[itchyjunk]> Klinda, my stat profs advisor was one people involved in random forest
[20:49:13] <[itchyjunk]> i think they trademarked that one right?
[20:54:41] <Klinda> I don't know, I know only about decision and regression trees, maybe in some lectures for sure she explain random forest as ensemble method
[20:57:49] <[itchyjunk]> deepforest is just decision tree no?
[20:57:55] <[itchyjunk]> or implimentation of it
[20:58:34] <[itchyjunk]> anyway, i have no skin in the game. i am fine if you wanna believe NN's are the most used models globally
[21:01:51] *** Joins: trace987 (~trace@ip5b429941.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[21:03:29] <Klinda> I don't know, for example I know that state of the art nlp problems are using neural networks
[21:04:49] <Klinda> I just don't know the entrie world ahah
[21:05:06] <Klinda> we can do a statistic about that
[21:05:27] <Klinda> maybe neural nets are the most fascinating thing about ml
[21:08:30] <HuntsMan> [itchyjunk]: nothing about the "deepmind paper"?
[21:14:28] <[itchyjunk]> Klinda, yes attention mechanism dominated nlp
[21:14:35] <[itchyjunk]> transformer and friends
[21:17:20] <[itchyjunk]> Klinda, some smart programming people i was talking to said "agent based problem solving" will be a nice subdomain where NN might not be used

[21:18:15] <[itchyjunk]> Klinda, if you saw the ant and slime simulation stuff i linked to few days back. they can be used to find acceptable solutions to tranvelling salesman problem or say transportation problem
[21:21:25] <hodapp> it's hard to reliably define what 'most used' means, but while all sorts of 'classical' ML hang around (with lots of linear/logistic regression, decision trees, and xgboost), outside of that it's pretty strictly neural nets
[21:23:00] <HuntsMan> hodapp: that was my point, hard data is needed
[21:23:34] <hodapp> for articles like DeepMind using MCTS, that is a rounding error on top of all of NN-based work they do
[21:23:38] <[itchyjunk]> Outside of non nn, it's all nn.
[21:23:41] <[itchyjunk]> Hard to disagree.
[21:24:07] <hodapp> [itchyjunk]: more like 'outside of tabular/structured data'
[21:27:08] <hodapp> Klinda: yeah, from what I've seen decision trees (standalone) are pretty rarely used outside of a context where it is crucial that a person be able to follow and understand the reasoning
[21:29:56] <hodapp> e.g. one of the papers I read in my masters was about them creating a decision tree to help nurses diagnose sepsis better - but where there was (justifiable) mistrust in a black-box system
[21:30:53] <[itchyjunk]> Business use RandomForest as a "blackkbox"
[21:31:26] <[itchyjunk]> a major sales analysis consutancy did a seminar where they talked about it at the local uni recently
[21:31:48] <[itchyjunk]> they reason for not using NN (as i understood) was "why bother? we're making moeny with this already"
[21:32:02] <hodapp> yes, for tabular data it's fairly common to see random forests and xgboost
[21:32:06] <[itchyjunk]> they have teams testing nn's
[21:32:12] <[itchyjunk]> but they don't bother with it in production
[21:32:20] <[itchyjunk]> same story with intermountain hospital chain
[21:33:54] <[itchyjunk]> ofcourse i might be biased based on what i have heard headhunters talk about around me
[21:41:49] <Klinda> I am also a beginner in the topic, I just know that I have one of the most relavant teacher about nlp
[21:42:34] <Klinda> he created babelnet
[21:42:51] <[itchyjunk]> i don't formally study ml/cs
[21:42:56] <[itchyjunk]> so people who do probably know more
[21:43:07] <[itchyjunk]> take what i say with a grain of salt
