[00:01:20] <pyzozord> I'm not sure if binary search counts as divide and conquery
[00:01:21] <absentia> oh
[00:02:07] <pyzozord> apparently it does
[00:02:25] <pyzozord> "The name "divide and conquer" is sometimes applied to algorithms that reduce each problem to only one sub-problem, such as the binary search algorithm"
[00:02:26] <bjs> pyzozord: it's like the trivial base case
[00:02:34] <bjs> divide it into 1 problem and solve that :P
[00:03:03] <pyzozord> it kind of escapes me what merge sort and binary search have in common that can be both called divide and conquery
[00:03:10] <pyzozord> other than they literally divide data
[00:03:21] <pyzozord> divide and repeaet
[00:03:25] <bjs> pyzozord: they divide the input problem up into smaller problems and solve those smaller problems

[00:04:56] <bjs> pyzozord: for binary search you divide the problem into a smaller problem that looks the same and solve that instead, for merge sort you break the problem up into two smaller problems and solve each of those instead (and then put the answers back together)
[00:05:06] <absentia> i want to grok stats
[00:05:17] <absentia> unfortunately this will probably take over 10 years
[00:05:27] <bjs> I guess binary search doesn't really feel like "divide and conquer" because it's not really.. dividing?  it's like "make-smaller-and-conquer" :P

[05:13:32] <epony> you have no CPU that runs LLVM IR directly
[05:13:39] <epony> (yet)
[05:13:58] <ProfSimm> LLVM is used in interpreted languages like JS. And JIT requires the presence of an interpreter, but is compilation.

[05:14:16] <epony> no CPU that runs functional programming programs faster than c programs either
[05:14:28] <ProfSimm> They compile it on the fly to other code. Compiling on the fly? Interpreting
[05:14:36] <epony> some things stay the same, regardless how fancy and powerful CPUs become
[05:15:00] <ProfSimm> epony: "functional language" is a broad category that spans very different languages.

[05:27:10] <ProfSimm> You run everything I say through some stupid filter where I make a claim like parallel execution and it comes out the other end as if I said "FP superior"
[05:27:26] <ProfSimm> FP is clumsy in many ways
[05:27:45] <ProfSimm> But no shared state is an objective benefit.
[05:27:49] <ProfSimm> Mutable that is

[05:28:22] <ProfSimm> FP is one way

[05:47:24] <ProfSimm> epony: ultimately in, say, 100 years, there will be a single paradigm for programming that incorporates some version of everything we do. Imperative programming becomes more functional. Functional more imperative. OOP is just basically... doesn't mean anything these days, except having encapsulation and polymorphism, which functional languages also have
[05:47:55] <ProfSimm> epony: what extra instructions
[05:48:01] <epony> you'll have to wait more years before assembler and machine code start taking functions as arguments
[05:48:14] <epony> like more than you can imagine
[05:48:43] <ProfSimm> epony: the nastiest thing of FP is that you express recreating a data structure, but slightly different. I actually hate that part, but there's a lot done to infer mutations from it, and structural sharing means you don't duplicate everything, but small fragments of a data structure
[05:49:14] <ProfSimm> Rust tries to go about it a different route by adding move semantics (linear types) and permit mutations on them.
[05:49:21] <ProfSimm> That also avoids the problem of shared mutable state

[06:13:49] <ProfSimm> epony: you can step debug through FP as anything else, and you have no mutable state so it's much easier to isolate a function to test
[06:13:53] <zzz> epony: would you care to expand on your point?

[06:15:51] <Thedarkb> Ah
[06:15:56] <Thedarkb> I don't remember him.
[06:16:11] <Belxjander> FP vs OOP is a non-argument to me as there is a strength in both styles and any claims of "debugless" are moot since both require a person at a keyboard typing somewhere in the process... so by default any claim otherwise is prima fascae excrementally challenged
[06:16:11] <Thedarkb> I can't remember if I was in here at the time or not, I think back then I just squatted in language specific channels.

[06:32:44] <ProfSimm> epony: so the next step is to make it fall apart when it doesn't
[06:32:51] <epony> ProfSimm, explain now, what is this "mutate" thing
[06:33:09] <ProfSimm> epony: you won't like it, it sounds like functional programming
[06:33:17] <epony> does it mean uncertain computation result?
[06:33:26] <ProfSimm> epony: no
[06:33:41] <ejjfunky> amigojapan, the real ingredient is the japanese milk. they're really, really good!
[06:33:47] <ProfSimm> epony: it means we have a data structure representing, say a map. To set a key on this map, the map needs to return itself with this key set
[06:34:04] <epony> or does it mean just a name for generic structure to instantiate
[06:34:08] <ProfSimm> epony: there's no other concept of mutation

[06:36:00] <ejjfunky> amigojapan, i wonder if they're a difference between milk from kobe cows and just the wagyu cows? also, i wonder if kobe is actually a subset of wagyu?

[16:01:00] <pikapika> The beauty of C++ is that those "loosely typed" parts are often no longer needed to be as loosely typed, and sometimes are computed right at compile time itself
[16:01:00] <merijn> pikapika: C's type are the worst. Strict enough to lose the flexibility of python, but not powerful enough to gain the flexibility of ADTs like in Haskell/Rust

[18:38:45] <absentia> but professional mathematicians have already done that shit

[18:39:49] <absentia> i couldn't read a paper written by a grad student

[23:43:59] <Hash> If you run a custom NS like bind9 zones or zomething, you can create your own ns glue records (if for same domain)
[23:44:07] <epony> you add there authoritative zones, but if you're asking, then you don't need to know
[23:44:07] <Hash> Go to ##networking
[23:44:16] <pyzozord> oh right kebab-case
[23:44:43] <pyzozord> Casey Muratori has interesting style it uses a mixture of multiple styles
[23:45:09] <pyzozord> it's not just his, it seems quite popular in those gamedev circles
[23:45:23] <absentia> what if we stopped relying on whitespace as a field/identifier separator
[23:45:27] <absentia> delimiter
[23:45:31] <epony> Wh0, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone
[23:45:32] <bayaz> Title: DNS root zone - Wikipedia 
[23:45:39] <absentia> then we could have identifiers with spaces in them

[23:46:22] <epony> Wh0, then this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone
[23:46:22] <bayaz> Title: DNS zone - Wikipedia 
[23:46:30] <absentia> pfff

[23:46:44] <pyzozord> absentia: that is=a bad idea
[23:46:51] <epony> Wh0, and then https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server#Authoritative_name_server
[23:46:52] <bayaz> Title: Name server - Wikipedia 
[23:47:07] <absentia> really just read RFC 1034
[23:47:09] <absentia> it's not that bad
[23:47:19] <absentia> it starts from the very beginning, in 1987
[23:47:50] <absentia> it's also an authoritative document
[23:48:00] <absentia> not just written by a bunch of schmucks on wikipedia
[23:48:46] <epony> Wh0, and this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Name_servers for the overview and general details on the DNS topic
[23:48:46] <bayaz> Title: Domain Name System - Wikipedia 
[23:49:39] <Wh0> i have just registered domain (free) at freenom. the next step is add/use "custom nameserver" ?
[23:49:47] <epony> now, after basic terminology, you would know, name servers make the DNS system work, and if you want to run one, you can, so you can serve your own DNS resolution of resolving or authoritative type (when you own a domain)
[23:49:47] <absentia> Wh0: just use theirs
[23:49:48] *** Quits: Null_A (~null_a@2601:645:8700:2290:a4fb:481a:7fa9:b909) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:49:50] <absentia> don't use a custom nameserver
[23:49:53] <Wh0> ok
[23:49:53] <absentia> you will have to pay extra
[23:49:57] *** Quits: novns (~novns@user/novns) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[23:50:25] <Wh0> so, what is next step?
[23:50:29] <epony> you can use custom if you have hosting service
[23:50:42] <Wh0> do i need hosting service?
[23:50:51] <Wh0> hosting service is separate than domain name registration?
[23:50:53] *** Joins: novns (~novns@user/novns)
[23:50:57] <absentia> god
[23:51:09] <epony> yes it is, despite domain registries trying to sell you theirs
[23:51:36] <epony> a hosting provider might ask you to use their DNS servers (most of the time on well integrated hosting setups)
[23:51:42] <epony> that is where you use "custom"
[23:51:42] <Wh0> is there any free webhosting service available?
[23:52:04] <perro_> plenty for static files
[23:52:05] <epony> yes, but you don't want it because of the negative effects on your setup
[23:52:11] <absentia> Wh0: why are you buying a domain
[23:52:21] <Wh0> which kind of negative effect?
[23:52:41] <epony> it can be advertising or otherwise incomplete and under-provisioning in general
[23:53:01] <Wh0> i registered a domain to absentia build a website to put/float some random thoughts/articles on web
[23:53:03] <epony> not your own control being the most concerning
[23:53:35] <perro_> you just want to do that, host it on github pages or something
[23:53:43] *** Joins: elves-upstate (~elves-ups@129-2-180-38.wireless.umd.edu)
[23:54:09] <Wh0> i wanted my own URL hence choose freenom over github perro_ 
[23:54:36] <perro_> youc an do that
[23:54:38] <epony> you can use some generic hosting with that
[23:54:55] <perro_> you can point to github pages
[23:54:56] <pyzozord> how does grep tell if a file is text or binary?
[23:55:00] <perro_> noboy will know you are hosting there
[23:55:18] <pyzozord> it must first scan entire file and find non printable codes
[23:55:30] <epony> there are many providers, you need it to use a fairly decent one to host your own domain name
[23:57:01] <Hash> dmt IN A 149.28.12.253 
[23:57:03] <Hash> lsd IN A 129.146.187.63
[23:57:08] <Wh0> "point to github pageS" , i didnt get it, do i need a new domain at github in addition to freenom? perro_ 
[23:57:08] <Hash> Those are my dns servers
[23:57:15] <Hash> But not up atm
[23:57:19] <Hash> I'm using cloudflare
[23:57:29] <Wh0> cloudflare has free web hosting?
[23:57:50] <epony> it does CDN front end services like DNS hosting / pointing and management too
[23:57:59] <epony> but it's a kill-switch
[23:58:27] <Gdegree> hey epony 
[23:58:37] <Wh0> so they can make site down at anytime? epony 
[23:59:01] <epony> you can get pulled off from the internet by them following orders of takedown etc, so CDNs are the last piece of the puzzle, that you might get away without, for casual hosting
