[09:45:46] <rdrg109> Here's a very interesting task: Create a function such when the cursor is on a line that contain a Firefox auto-generated curl command (those ones generated when clicking "Coy as CURL" in the Developer Tools), break the oneliner in multiple lines which are split between each flag usage.

[09:48:36] <bpalmer> step one: write a helper command that does '{ int i; for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) { puts(argv[i]); } }'   and then replace the 'curl' with your helper command
[09:48:53] <rdrg109> twb: I think this has nothing to do with Firefox, it is just that I like experimenting with APIs so I usually copy CURL request from developer tools, so switching between browser would get me to the same CURL request (I don't think there is a browser that split a CURL request in multiple lines at each flag usage)
[09:49:12] <bpalmer> step 2: start copying each line of output one by one into your paragraph until reaching overflow, at which case back up and insert a backslash and newline
[09:49:54] <twb> shlex can do fake "close enough" parsing
[09:50:19] <twb> I suspect libcurl can do it also
[09:50:57] <bpalmer> actually, it gets a little more complicated depending on how things are output; for example, curl supports --cacert <filename>   ; this can be written as "--cacert /tmp/file.crt" or "--cacert=/tmp/file.crt", so you have to decide whether you're going to support both
[09:51:06] <bpalmer> if so, you need to make sure you know what options support arguments.

[10:56:54] <sachac> plus it's kinda neat filtering through lots of M-x commands with a couple of strokes, or having more mnemonic shortcuts.

[18:33:32] <twb> anddam: do you use menu bar, tool bar, or scroll bar AT ALL?  It is common to turn them all off.
[18:33:42] <gnoo> if you use scroll bar and tool bar, use gtk2/3 else just emacs-x11
[18:33:51] <anddam> no, I used spacemacs for a while (kinda used to vi-style modes)
[18:33:55] <twb> anddam: if you don't use those, you probably don't care about which build you use.
[18:34:04] <twb> anddam: the main canvas in all cases is rendered by emacs, not GTK
[18:34:08] <anddam> I have been using vscode for a while but I tend to never use menus, I use the command palette
[18:34:14] <twb> anddam: this will change in Emacs 28
[18:34:41] <twb> anddam: the other gotcha is, there is a bug in the GTK build if you close X but continue running Emacs.
[18:34:53] <twb> anddam: if you don't normally close X, you probably don't care
[18:35:05] <twb> anddam: the GTK build will also use slightly more RAM.

[21:43:31] <sm[m]> hey all. How can I stop tput sgr0 from printing ^[(B to stdout when in a shell.el buffer ? 
[21:44:18] <wasamasa> lol
[21:44:28] <wasamasa> it's an escape sequence for a terminal, not a shell
[21:44:34] <sm[m]> or, any other way to reset the ANSI color cleanly in a shell-mode buffer ?
[21:44:44] <wgreenhouse> ,wgreenhouses-law
[21:44:45] <fsbot> wgreenhouses-law is don't lie about TERM, but if you must lie about TERM, be consistent in all environments.

[21:45:18] <wgreenhouse> if you don't do that, you won't have these sequences to filter out later
[21:45:21] <sm[m]> tput does reset the color in shell-mode, but also prints junk. TERM is xterm-256color, and specifying that with tput -T ... does the same
[21:45:31] <sm[m]> with -T vt100 it prints something else (^O)
[21:45:44] <wgreenhouse> sm[m]: yeah, TERM is not xterm-256color in shell-mode

[22:57:56] <makomo> especially when keyboard events are represented using strings instead of vectors
[22:58:23] <makomo> it's quite a hairy mess from what i can see, and i don't get one thing. how exactly does a string being uni- or multibyte affect the behavior of define-key or kbd for example?
[22:58:42] <makomo> e.g. (kbd (string-to-multibyte "\M-x")) vs (kbd "\M-x")
[22:58:43] <johnjay> i guess start with buffer.c
[22:59:06] <makomo> also (string-multibyte-p "\M-x") => nil
[22:59:25] <roto> ,(string-multibyte-p "\M-x")
[22:59:26] <fsbot> whoops,  Symbol‚Äôs function definition is void: fs-string-multibyte-p
[22:59:33] <aindilis> is there anything that when you open a file, automatically installs and loads the corresponding major-mode?
[22:59:41] <makomo> so one expression is with a unibyte, the other with a multibyte string, but they contain the same character
[22:59:52] <makomo> since uni/multi-byte is just a matter of internal representation
[23:00:16] <bpalmer> aindilis: installs, as in looks for a mode that would handle the thing in an elpa and do a package install?
[23:00:24] <aindilis> bpalmer: yeah
[23:00:38] <johnjay> aindilis: no you'd have to mess with auto-mode-alist, that's all emacs provides. that and various hooks like opening a file or closing a file

[23:01:04] <bpalmer> aindilis: no, I don't believe so; you could certainly write something that does it but then you'd have to download it which maps filenames to package-names, which is as hard as just downloading the package by hand.

[23:02:25] <hodapp> VSCode's C/C++ support is... surprisingly decent

[23:02:43] <aindilis> so why no vscode bindings for emacs?
[23:02:48] <johnjay> however i don't know how popular vscode is, just the thing that popped into my head
[23:02:55] <bpalmer> the thing is ... emacs major modes are so tiny that it's almost certainly worthwhile to just include something directly rather than include an index that points at it 
[23:03:15] <aindilis> well my best developer buddy uses something like vscode, and will switch to emacs if vscode bindings are there
[23:03:20] <johnjay> that's the other thing. emacs tries to have the attitude of providing all the "basic" major modes by default

[23:09:42] <aindilis> for power users
[23:09:45] <technomancy> johnjay: it's a lot more than just bindings; it's got preconfigured packages
[23:09:47] <technomancy> I think
[23:09:59] <johnjay> yes it streamlines package management which is what aindilis was hinting at
[23:10:00] <technomancy> I dunno; I don't pretend to understand what non-emacs-users think like

[23:10:36] <johnjay> technomancy: from what little i've seen of doom emacs i think that's probably close. but to actually find that out you'd need to find out what people use. i guess
[23:10:47] <aindilis> well I'm interested in building AI
[23:10:55] <aindilis> I'm actually writing some AI algos in elisp
[23:11:03] <aindilis> and also controlling it from external ais
[23:11:15] <technomancy> johnjay: what we saw with spacemacs is that you can draw a lot of people in with preconfigured packages but in the long run it causes a lot of problems because people don't understand what they're using
[23:11:33] <johnjay> i thought spacemacs did something else though
[23:11:35] <aindilis> technomancy: you're associated with spacemacs?

[23:12:17] <technomancy> johnjay: spacemacs was more common than emacs without spacemacs
[23:12:18] <d4k> aindilis: nice, but that sounds you already find a powerful emacs distro beside what technomancy already mentioned
[23:12:39] <aindilis> well the thing is it's hard to stay on top of what other people have developed
[23:12:48] <aindilis> so you always have to jump on the new wagon
[23:12:50] <johnjay> right but were people running into problems understanding emacsisms or the packages they downloaded then didn't understand why they didn't do xyz
[23:13:09] <johnjay> because the latter isn't really related to emacs at all
[23:13:47] <johnjay> like if you download magit and don't understand what a remote repository or HEAD means that's not emacs
[23:14:26] <d4k> aindilis: oh but that sounds like you're looking for a cutting edge emacs with batteries included
[23:15:02] <aindilis> well I posted about mullikine's Emacs env based on spacemacs, it's the most powerful one I've seen, but there could be something I haven't seen.
[23:15:14] <aindilis> so I have to be annoying and ask
