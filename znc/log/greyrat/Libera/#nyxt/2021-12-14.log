[13:32:23] <mrvdb> I traced my compile problem mentioned yesterday to a git problem. All submodule urls in .gitmodules ending in '/' failed for me on the 'update' step, which means that none of the submodules got checked out which led to the sbcl compile error. Fix was easy, remove the trailing slashes from the urls in .gitmodules. Should I file an issue for this? this might be a local issue, not sure.

[16:07:48] <mrvdb> it was indeed a local git config issue (url replacements)
[16:26:22] <rotateq> I successfully let SBCL compile nyxt on my Manjaro Machine this night. :)
[16:29:00] <Jing> congrats
[16:29:23] <mrvdb> rotateq: nice, i'm currently running into issue https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1936 so I'm almost there, I think.
[16:29:24] <rotateq> i had no doubt about it (for the CL things)
[16:29:36] <rotateq> sad, on what kind of system?
[16:29:55] <mrvdb> arch linux, sbcl latest, gcc latest
[16:30:09] <rotateq> hmmm
[16:31:33] <mrvdb> a rollback to just before the mentioned commit in the issue does work fine though.
[16:31:37] <waleee> mrvdb: where are libfixposix installed for you? (... and how is it installed)?
[16:31:59] <waleee> the same way as in the issue?
[16:33:01] <mrvdb> waleee: this pc uses libfixposic from the aur repositories, installed below /usr/lib
[16:33:15] <mrvdb> s/posic/posix/
[16:33:31] <waleee> so the include paths is correct
[16:34:07] <mrvdb> yep, the line giving the error compiles fine if i run it manually
[16:34:20] <waleee> the next question would be if libsoub-2.4 is at /usr/include/libsoup-2.4
[16:34:32] <rotateq> now i just have to use it more seriously and less firefox
[16:35:08] <mrvdb> waleee: it is
[16:36:16] <rotateq> the last weeks firefox was crashing some times out of nowhere and then "exit due to channel error"
[16:36:27] <waleee> mrvdb: can you try install webkit2gtk-4.1 (and keep the wekbit2gtk package) and try building again?
[16:36:44] <mrvdb> sure
[16:37:20] <waleee> edgarvincent[m] and a fun issue where recent commits didn't build cleanly on arch about a week ago, which was mitigated by that
[16:38:47] <edgarvincent[m]> waleee: seems not to work anymore, I'm completely lost
[16:39:01] <waleee> ah. Bummer :(
[16:40:53] <edgarvincent[m]> I'll have another go at it when I have a moment.
[16:42:13] <mrvdb> makes no difference
[16:42:26] <mrvdb> makes no difference
[16:42:34] <waleee> mrvdb: are you the one who created the issue you linked?
[16:42:46] <mrvdb> makes no difference
[16:43:42] <mrvdb> sorry for the repeats. no  I commented on the issue, but did not create it
[16:44:03] <waleee> but the error you get is identical?
[16:44:11] <mrvdb> yes
[16:44:46] <waleee> can you try setting the CC environment variable explicitly (ie export CC=gcc)?
[16:45:06] <rotateq> or try with tcc :)
[16:45:44] <waleee> I'm skeptical that it would be able to compile the webextensions library
[16:46:30] <mrvdb> waleee: export of CC makes no difference.
[16:47:14] <mrvdb> its unclear to me which file is not found from the error message, how can i find out?
[16:49:45] <waleee> mrvdb: those paths are what pkg-info found when being executed in https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/libraries/web-extensions/Makefile#L3
[16:49:50] <waleee> so all the files should exist
[16:50:26] <waleee> and then it fails for the first c-file cc tries to compile
[16:51:31] <waleee> which is the reason to suspect some malfunctioning CC-setting
[16:52:32] <waleee> mrvdb: you can try manually reverting this commit https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/commit/91e2d81482d11645dd2f75f899ff3c6884dd42dc

[16:57:56] <mrvdb> same
[17:01:01] <mrvdb> except of course "cc" now reads "gcc" in the error message
[17:02:15] <waleee> just to be 100% sure, can you execute gcc in a terminal?
[17:04:14] <mrvdb> yep
[17:05:01] <mrvdb> is running make in the libraries/webextensions directory meaningful? that produces a linker option error
[17:05:28] <waleee> yeah, that is an option to build it
[17:05:43] <waleee> what is the linker error?
[17:05:51] <mrvdb> ld: unrecognized option '-Wl,--export-dynamic'
[17:06:46] <waleee> looks like some expansion get's borked if that's passed as a single option
[17:08:13] <waleee> have you set sh to something explicitly?
[17:09:16] <mrvdb> sh points too bash by default i think, nog explicit changed from me, my interactive shell is zsh
[17:16:27] <waleee> ok. Then the last thing I can think of is that one of the libs might not like --export-dynamic
[17:17:16] <waleee> on line 10 of the makefile, if you remove ${LDFLAGS}, do you still get the error?
[17:19:40] <mrvdb> yep
[17:21:24] <mrvdb> pkg-config webkit2gtk-web-extension-4.0 --libs inserts those options
[17:22:14] <waleee> -Wl and --export-dynamic is listed?
[17:22:37] <waleee> ... when you run it
[17:22:56] <mrvdb> yeah, execturing `pkg-config webkit2gtk-web-extension-4.0 --libs` lists the options aftter '-lsoup-2.4'
[17:23:07] <mrvdb> executing*
[17:23:35] <waleee> annoying. Those are not present for me on clearlinux
[17:24:48] <waleee> you can experiment with pasting in the result of that pkg-config query, without the -Wl and --export-dynamic
[17:25:15] <mrvdb> yeah, doing that already
[17:32:45] <mrvdb> removing -Wl,--export-dynamic and -pthread make the compilation go in the subdir, and subsequently in the main dir after that. Main make all still fails if not compiling the subdire manually, a spurious '-pthread' gets inserted
[17:42:04] <mrvdb> waleee: so, for me, replacing --libs with --libs-only-l makes the process happy, no idea if the resulting binary is any good though
[17:43:26] <waleee> probably. The other options is inserted from the global LDFLAGS
[17:43:35] <waleee> err
[17:43:38] <waleee> scrap that
[17:44:20] <waleee> probably the .pc files or a global LDFLAGS

[22:49:14] <aartaka> lagash: Plump itself is not so impressive (and I doubt it changed much over the time), but it is a solid base for things like CLSS, lQuery and Nyxt element hints, which are impressive.
[22:54:14] <lagash> jmercouris: I might have found a bug, so, I keep my dotfiles as symlinks, and Nyxt reads in ~/.local/share/nyxt/bookmarks.lisp just fine, but when it writes it back it destroys the symlink..
[22:58:54] <waleee> the files in .local/share/nyxt arent meant to be immutable
[22:59:09] <waleee> (and are written to by nyxt)

[23:00:53] <waleee> lagash: you should have the config in .config/nyxt/init.lisp and possibly other lisp files loaded by it (the only file nyxt might touch there is auto-config.lisp)
[23:01:42] <lagash> waleee: you misread (?), this isn't my init, this is my bookmarks file
[23:02:11] *** Quits: Kabouik (~Kabouik@user/kabouik) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:02:16] <waleee> ah, I assumed you meant dotfiles as in nyxts ones
[23:02:37] <waleee> but you symlink all of them?
[23:02:59] <lagash> yes, my symlink'd init works fine
[23:03:29] <lagash> I also have auto-mode-rules.lisp symlink'd - I should check if it overrides that one as well
[23:07:13] <waleee> lagash: could you check what uiop:truenamize returns for the bookmark.lisp file?
[23:08:55] <lagash> OK it also overrides auto-mode-rules.lisp
[23:09:27] <lagash> waleee: from where? within Nyxt?
[23:10:01] <waleee> doesn't matter a repl should be fine too I think
[23:11:10] <waleee> it's some uiop function-usage that wipes the symlink at least

[23:20:12] <lagash> so.. does that help?
[23:21:33] <waleee> I was hoping it would return something that looked obviously wrong
[23:23:15] <waleee> lagash: the issue is probably that the data-path-p (https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/14b0abc6c031050cfb814b8b84d828fa87c09956/source/data-storage.lisp#L77) predicate is false on that line with the symlink
[23:24:43] <mariari> init keeps symlink fine waleee
[23:24:44] <waleee> and then the other code in that file merrily goes creating the directory from scratch
[23:26:44] <jmercouris> in case you haven't seen this: https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/nyxt-showcase-and-configuration-demo.org
[23:28:06] <jmercouris> lagash: hm, yes
[23:28:28] <jmercouris> I think waleee is correct
[23:28:38] <jmercouris> of course init keeps symlink fine, we don't rewrite your init file
[23:28:50] <jmercouris> but we do rewrite your bookmarks file, and your auto-config file whenever a change is made
[23:28:55] <jmercouris> well, not 'rewrite' but append or whatever
[23:29:16] <jmercouris> it is really high time we polished the data storage library, redid the API, and pulled it out into a library
[23:29:22] <jmercouris> when we do this, we can solve this problem as well
[23:29:37] <jmercouris> s/of course//
[23:30:52] <jmercouris> of course is just a filler phrase, doesn't mean anything, and I'm not implying that you are dumb for not realizing something
[23:30:52] <jmercouris> WOAH WE ARE 80 PEOPLE IN THE CHANNEL!
[23:30:52] <jmercouris> WOO WOO! Happy Tomato Tuesday everyone!

[23:34:25] <pjb> Of course, "of course" is just a filler phrase.
[23:39:10] <waleee> lagash: is the bookmark.lisp symlink wiped even if you do not save any new bookmarks?

[23:50:20] <waleee> nyxt -vvv was surprisingly unhelpful here
[23:51:57] <waleee> the only verbose part is that it messages that it has saved X number of bookmarks to ~/.local/share/nyxt/bookmarks.lisp (and overwriting any symlink in the process)
