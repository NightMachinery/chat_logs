[01:41:16] <Saito552> Yep it seems like it might be that from my searching
[01:41:17] <knotMez> Saito552 looks like you want to use the "Radeon" driver

[03:36:59] <Saito552> if it comes down to it

[03:41:13] <f843d0> knotMez: anyhow, in this specific case looks like is preventing resolution setting

[04:51:17] <Dagmar> Firewalld has some rules with names that are fairly nasty looking, but there's a point to it.  Every chain just jumps straight to a new custom chain that is created by firewalld.

[05:17:32] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[05:18:07] <jochum> Ohh fuck
[05:18:09] <Dagmar> It took the network security guys, despite the fancy Checkpoint interface, _a full day_ to notice there were a zillion queries coming from the nameserver to some poor internal host, and that whole department in question was _down_
[05:18:17] <Dagmar> They had no game plan.
[05:18:37] <jochum> Thanks for sharing that with us.
[05:18:38] <Dagmar> THey failed to _develop_ a game plan, either, because fast forward to a few years later, some of my friends still work at this place
[05:18:42] <Saito552> hey whats that command to check how fast your booting was again
[05:18:56] <Dagmar> They were having problems with SPF/DMARC/DKIM buggery that was very erratic to say the last
[05:18:58] <Saito552> because mint told me about a kernel update and i applied it
[05:19:08] <sheep> with systemd, systemd-analyze time
[05:19:10] <Dagmar> Turns out, the network security guys decided to "harden" things by BLOCKING 25/tcp
[05:19:16] <Saito552> and it felt like with nomodeset off it might have booted faster
[05:19:30] <Saito552> not as fast as with nomodeset on but
[05:19:33] <Saito552> i just wanna check
[05:19:45] <Dagmar> So, anything that the nameserver might need to say that wouldn't fit in a UDP packet (like a pile of TXT records, and even some address lookups) would fail

[05:23:20] <Dagmar> So, if you have a ton of TXT records (as it starting to happen now with SPF and friends) for an entry, it's going to get kind of important
[05:23:50] <kfrench> Protip: Log anything your firewall blocks from trusted hosts.  Investigate each entry and figure out if something is misconfigured (including your firewall).
[05:24:01] <Dagmar> kfrench++
[05:24:35] <jochum> you use tools like graylog for it?
[05:24:47] <Dagmar> Trusted hosts suddenly up and doing what appears to be a portscan is often about the only warning you're going to get without running a full sensor suite somewhere
[05:25:33] <kfrench> Dagmar: ++
[05:25:59] <Dagmar> jochum: In practice, a host that can be non-ironically called "trusted" isn't going to be sending _any_ questionable traffic around unless something is wrong
[05:26:13] <kfrench> It's really hard retrofitting an existing network with a new firewall management process.  It's much easier to build the network clean at the beginning.

[05:26:29] <jochum> kfrench: i agree!
[05:26:36] <Dagmar> If a print server starts trying to ssh into other hosts (for example) generally it's time to look into who got into the box that shouldnt' have

[05:27:11] <kfrench> I think "trusted" in this case means you know the admin of said host and where they live.  You don't trust it, but you make you firewall understand what the expected traffic is.

[06:14:49] <Dagmar> I have three screens, and GPU output #1 goes to the one in the center for good reason... the other two displays are in portrait orientation
[06:15:34] <Dagmar> About 1/3 of the way through the install, it'll get the nVidia driver and enable it, which causes the expected screen refresh and jump to higher resolution, but then I have no idea why it decides it needs to continue the install on display #2 (which is in portrait mode) other than just to piss me off.

[10:30:17] <hexnewbie> OK, I found the service, and it is not logging anything when *I* fail to login to it

[10:30:24] <pikapika> I don't know how the mysqls ended up in that state in the first place
[10:30:32] <hexnewbie> It *is* my patched sshd where I did edit the logging code
[10:30:32] <pikapika> it was all standard distro mysql
[10:30:33] <TJ-> hexnewbie: is there another sshd operating disguised or on an alternate port? however, if you're using custom sshd code that'd be the first thing to check
[10:30:34] <pikapika> no changes
[10:31:21] <hexnewbie> TJ-: Yeah, when I try to login as root on the Debian sshd, it works, when I login on mine it does not (both have been patched, but the latter one has extra config options to activate my code)

[10:34:36] <jim> pikapika, debian has a factoid called bat, the info from which could help you solve problems like this... bat is: [Basic Apt* Troubleshooting]. To diagnose your problem, we need ALL OF THE FOLLOWING information: 1. complete output of your apt-get/apt/aptitude run (including the command used) 2. output from "apt-cache policy pkg1 pkg2..." for ALL packages mentioned ANYWHERE in the problem, and 3. "apt-cache policy".  Use https://paste.debian.net/ to
[10:34:36] <jim> provide us with this information.
[10:34:48] <TJ-> f843d0: yes, tried that; I think the issue is at a lower level

[10:35:41] <f843d0> TJ-: maybe you can try to sniff the BT traffic and check if events were transmitted?
[10:36:07] <pikapika> jim, I will just be going to leave for now. I'll pull up those files later tomorrow.
[10:36:29] <pikapika> Thanks for all the help
[10:36:36] <TJ-> f843d0: that was my next attack but don't see the ability in bluetoothctl so looking for another tool that can. It'd be good to check libinput too (which X is using)

[10:38:57] <f843d0> TJ-: bluetoothctl from bluez-utils is just CLI utility to perform operations on BT, but shouldn't perform sniffing

Still supported of course, with a configurable timeout. But basically it's just lack of traffic on data lines that device controller might opt to detect.

[12:12:26] <dTal> the fact that you're asking that question leads me to believe you're attempting to "secure" something by hiding hardcoded plaintext passwords
[12:12:31] <sheep> jonas_: something like this may work: int filter_is_dir(struct dirent *entry) { return entry->d_type == DT_DIR; }. You need to #include <dirent.h> for this, and pass filter_is_dir as the filter argument for scandir
[12:13:07] <nomagno> vaeraindemian: well by default GCC doesn't do much to obfuscate the strings, ASCII can not be compressed very easily
[12:13:33] <nomagno> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_(Unix)
[12:13:44] <nomagno> Strings are recognized by looking for sequences of at least 4 (by default) printable characters terminating in a NUL character (that is, null-terminated strings).
[12:14:07] <nomagno> So yeah, it looks for ASCII in the binary, which usually works fine.
[12:14:09] <dTal> to do what you asked, you need to replace all the strings with obfuscated equivalents and write a decoder
[12:14:27] <nomagno> ^
[12:14:39] <dTal> note that it's still possible to extract the plaintext by running your program inside a debugger
[12:14:53] <nomagno> I think you can write a preprocessor macro to encode all of them at the start of the file?

[12:21:31] <varaindemian> dTal: hiding a ctf flag xd
[12:21:52] <LiaoTao> For the case where strings are somewhat uniformly distributed in the executable, you would probably need some sort of self-modifying code and/or custom compiler

[20:03:55] <moonmoon> if secure boot is enabled, that kernel module would need to be signed by a key that chains up to the trusted root in order for the kernel to be willing to load it
[20:04:12] <moonmoon> *to a trusted root, since you can install your own machine owner key and always sign things yourself

[20:05:47] <TomyWork> that would also imply that I basically couldn't install virtualbox or vmware, since those build their own kernel modules at install time
[20:06:09] *** Joins: chomwitt (~chomwitt@2a02:587:dc18:b400:12c3:7bff:fe6d:d374)
[20:06:33] <TomyWork> (virtualbox also builds it when updating the kernel. vmware just stops working lol)
[20:07:07] <lacroix> It has to be signed by a key the kernel already knows about.  The key the rest of the kernel is signed with is one such key, but you can create others and put them on the kernel keyring...
[20:07:30] <TomyWork> so if I want to install virtualbox, i have to do that?
[20:08:05] <TomyWork> if so, what keeps malware from using that key to install a rootkit?
[20:08:29] <moonmoon> good key management
[20:08:34] <TomyWork> remember, we're talking about a malware that already has root access
[20:08:35] <lacroix> Well... if you want virtualbox *and* the whole "trusted boot" thing, yes.
[20:09:11] <moonmoon> provision the key on an HSM like a yubikey so that the OS/kernel never sees the private key, and that requires physical interaction to make use of it to sign anything

[20:09:33] <TomyWork> so basically i'd need the yubikey every time i update my kernel?
[20:09:35] <lacroix> You use proper opsec to make sure the malware can't acces the privat part of that key. Put it on a USB stick and store that someplace the malware can't access.

[20:10:49] <TomyWork> i suppose the yubikey also needs be one that makes you confirm every use of the private key

[20:11:25] <TomyWork> moonmoon, exactly. the assumption was windows
[20:12:04] <lacroix> in simple words, you only need to sign things when you create them.  ie, when you create the kernel image or the module.
[20:12:21] <lacroix> The kernel and modules get signed when created. The public key is sufficient to verify tampering.
[20:12:32] <lacroix> you definitely don't need it for *boot*, if that's what you're thinking.
[20:12:34] <moonmoon> honestly having malware running as uid 0 is probably game over for your box anyway. Although at least you can safely reimage it without worrying about something that injects persistence into whatever you're using to do said reimage
