[22:29:07] <ThePendulum> they sent me a list of bits included with the screwdriver, "this is what is supposed to be included, did you get all of that?"

[22:37:37] <ThePendulum> I unscrewed them to demonstrate the bits they were talking about go inside each of those handles, but I think that might just confuse them more
[22:37:41] <joepie91> oooo, makita too
[22:37:45] <ThePendulum> next message is probably "so the other 3 are empty?"

[22:38:32] <ThePendulum> I am pretty forgiving but I definitely do have a threshold for idiocty where they'll just have to cut their losses, lol, if they still haven't told me they want them back by wednesday or so, yeah...
[22:38:52] <joepie91> that does look like a fairly neat kit
[22:39:13] <joepie91> not so sure about the screw cap though
