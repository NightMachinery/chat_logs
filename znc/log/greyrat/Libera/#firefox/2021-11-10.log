[06:08:52] <t4nk_freenode> also... maybe if you had a console window or web dev tools open, you might spot some additional signs and/or warnings

[06:18:19] <luva> t4nk_freenode, if you help me how to troubleshoot it, I might find out maybe whats causing it
[06:18:32] <luva> I just dont know which tools to use to spot the bug

[06:19:46] <t4nk_freenode> well, not necessarily, it might just cause some timeout on some parts... but this is just wild nonsensical guessing ;)
[06:20:29] <t4nk_freenode> if you hit F12 you should get some tools to look at
[06:20:56] <t4nk_freenode> there's a console window that might show some more info if you refresh the page

[06:25:34] <luva> I refreshed the page and went to the performance tab
[06:25:57] <luva> took  17 seconds after recording started until passwords show
[06:26:59] <t4nk_freenode> so.. after you've hit f12 .. refresh the page with the console window open
[06:27:08] <t4nk_freenode> maybe it will show you something
[06:27:25] <luva> I hit F12, yes, what page should I go to then? just leave it on thedebugger?
[06:27:52] <t4nk_freenode> it has a console entry as I said
[06:28:02] <t4nk_freenode> then hit refresh
[06:28:27] <luva> ah okay im sorry
[06:29:03] <luva> nothing in there t4nk_freenode
[06:29:21] *** Joins: pah (~pah@user/pah)
[06:29:41] <t4nk_freenode> what distro are you using btw?
[06:29:56] <luva> Linux mint
[06:30:51] <t4nk_freenode> if you made sure you backed up your profile... you might experiment with a different version of firefox perhaps
[06:33:45] <t4nk_freenode> I see there's also an option to export your logins
[06:34:02] <t4nk_freenode> don't see any import options though
[06:34:58] <luva> its possible to import I did it already
[06:36:32] <luva> but I feel like there should be a fix by mozilla since I didnt change anything im my configs when this started to happen
[06:36:33] <t4nk_freenode> if you start firerfox from a cmnd line, with 'firefox -p' I believe.. you can select or create a new profile
[06:36:55] <t4nk_freenode> yeah, users never change anything per definition
[06:37:19] <t4nk_freenode> anyhow, create a new profile and import your logins there.. see how it responds
[06:37:30] <t4nk_freenode> you can always delete the new profile later
[06:39:00] <luva> okay will do
[06:39:03] <luva> one second
[06:39:20] <t4nk_freenode> one-mis-sis-sip-py
[06:43:03] <luva> I get 1 error on the import
[06:43:05] <luva>  Row 1 Error: Missing url 
[06:43:15] <t4nk_freenode> kewl
[06:43:49] <t4nk_freenode> maybe it's nothing, but you might remove the entry or complete it
[06:44:11] <luva> I dont know which entry it means
[06:44:39] <t4nk_freenode> probably the first one
[06:45:00] <t4nk_freenode> you should be able just to open the file in a text editor
[06:45:05] <t4nk_freenode> see what might be wrong
[06:45:14] <luva> I have it open
[06:46:28] <luva> it loads much faster in the other firefox
[06:46:53] <luva> But I cant figure out which entry it is. the first row consists of headers (url, username, password)
[06:47:43] <luva> the second row consists  chrome://FirefoxAccounts and its entry
[06:48:00] <luva> I think ill just export everything delete everything and import again
[06:48:33] <t4nk_freenode> is it a csv file? maybe you can open it with excel or the linux variant
[06:48:47] <t4nk_freenode> you may be able to delete the entire line
[06:49:03] <t4nk_freenode> row I think it might be called
[06:49:25] <luva> Yeah thats what I see but since I dont know where the error is, I cannot delete just some line 
[06:49:44] <t4nk_freenode> or just go through the about:logins page, and delete anything you don't like
[06:50:39] <t4nk_freenode> presumably the offending entry has no website address associated
[06:53:29] <t4nk_freenode> but if it loads in the new profile, then that is an indicator and your other profile just got messed up a little
[06:54:43] <t4nk_freenode> going out on a limb: "it's been known to happen sometimes"
[06:55:30] <t4nk_freenode> there's no shame in moving your stuff to a new profile... take your bookmarks and history and stuff you like, and just start a new life for yourself
[06:58:15] <luva> yeah probably its true
[06:58:19] <luva> thanks for the help t4nk_freenode

[12:06:06] <t4nk_freenode> look ede; the versions 93 and 94 I had built without pgo and with clang/llvm13/rust1.56 ... were buggy like mad
[12:06:51] <t4nk_freenode> I've had it crash too, or hang everything when I visited dailymotion.com
[12:07:02] <t4nk_freenode> disconnect me from irc too...
[12:07:21] <ede> i'm not surprised. firefox has turned into a monster where i'd expect experience with building it would help a lot.
[12:07:40] <ede> wow and dm is really civilized compared to yt
[12:08:07] <t4nk_freenode> after a few youtubes it would stop playing video
[12:08:19] <t4nk_freenode> but one click @ dm and it hung
[12:09:14] <t4nk_freenode> so what we did was use rust 1.55, and be sure to use clang/llvm 12
[12:09:29] <t4nk_freenode> and personally I add pgo, but that will double compile time
[12:10:37] <t4nk_freenode> I believe there are some patches out for gentoo in the mean time, but I don't trust that it's solved yet
[12:10:52] <t4nk_freenode> so I'll wait a bit before trying llvm13 again

[14:29:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Apparently, there's also a hack for Firefox browsers from Flatpak that forces them to stop trying to use bitmap fonts.
[14:29:55] <BaronVladimirHar> It involves dropping a small XML file into your profile folder.
[14:29:55] <BaronVladimirHar> It's so wonderful that they leave ths unfixed for 4 years now while they patch the browser to "Don't say black!".
[14:30:31] <BaronVladimirHar> As if that's a dirty word or something. If George Carlin was a live today, he'd have to add it. Even though there's nothing wrong with the word.

[15:28:15] <MJCD> well yeah it's basically meant to trim off all the query params

[15:31:45] <MJCD> for the clean links i'll probably just try a different extension

[16:00:23] <ede> MJCD: online word, i think i've seen someone mentioning some config setting before with a similar environment
[16:01:00] <MJCD> lol mmm idk really all I know is it's fucking copy and paste ;p
[16:01:02] <ede> if it works in plain HTML (just as simple as echo "<textarea]…" > $file.html and opening it
[16:01:24] <MJCD> it's nothing like that in either thing so not sure what you're referring to haha
[16:01:25] <ede> then i'd tend to blame some rotten JS in the "web app"
[16:01:33] <MJCD> no like I select text
[16:01:38] <MJCD> I right click and go copy
[16:01:44] <MJCD> sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't
[16:02:01] <MJCD> the site has no baring over the browser level copy function
[16:02:20] <ede> a clipboard viewer showing you a live state of what it has could help
[16:02:26] <MJCD> I copy it again from the exact same site
[16:02:30] <MJCD> works great
[16:03:08] <MJCD> and I am not adopting clipboard viewer tooling because one of the biggest pieces of software in the world can't clipboard properly lol
[16:03:10] <MJCD> that's silly
[16:03:15] <ede> sure it isn't a hardware problem or just load? (i've had issues with both already)
[16:03:41] <MJCD> definitely not on either count and link has people also experiencing it intermittently as recently as this year
[16:03:43] <MJCD> so..
[16:05:11] <MJCD> like maybe if i'm using ctrl+c then there is room for error
[16:05:14] <ede> if it's the same site all the time it sounds more like beforementioned scripts
[16:05:21] <MJCD> right click-> copy should be virtually infallable
[16:05:31] <ede> rly? i trust my keyboard more than my mouse
[16:05:32] <MJCD> the script has it's own copy button
[16:05:37] <MJCD> that's an entirely separate thing
[16:05:57] <ede> so if it has its own copy facility it maybe just interferes
[16:05:59] <MJCD> it just doesn't work, it's fine i'll remove the extension but it has it's own separate button
[16:06:05] <MJCD> see above heh
[16:06:29] <MJCD> again this is the browser right click context ui button
[16:06:39] <MJCD> there is literally nothing that can get between that and the OS
[16:06:55] <MJCD> short of directly modifying and compiling firefox ofc ;p
[16:07:03] <ede> you mentioned a script with a copy button and an extension
[16:07:31] <MJCD> yeah entirely separate issue
[16:07:48] <MJCD> the question there was basically just "do you know of one that works properly"
[16:08:42] <MJCD> but is 1000% unrelated to the ff context menu official direct copy button just intermittently not doing that lol
[16:08:50] <MJCD> mostly comes up copying auth codes

[16:13:03] <ede> if it's separate you should keep it out of the other one

[16:14:13] <ede> some have their own copy button, others don't want to let you copy things at all, or apped a (c) or similar to the copied text
[16:15:11] <ede> if you want to be sure it's firefox you'd have to see it happen on an unscripted page (or one at least you *know* doesn't have some relevant scripting)
