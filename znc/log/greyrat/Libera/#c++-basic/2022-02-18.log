[00:01:10] <cbreak> ali1234: sizeof(bool) should always be 1 or more
[00:01:20] <cbreak> what was it with that optimization?
[00:02:29] *** Quits: Xardas (~Xardas@149.233.51.127) (Quit: Client closed)
[00:02:43] <ali1234> well there was a variable that required 16 bit alignment
[00:03:15] <ali1234> with O3 the boolean was either a multiple of 2 or padded
[00:03:30] <ali1234> with Os it was 1
[00:03:44] <ali1234> so removing it caused everything else to go back into correct alignment
[00:03:55] <ali1234> but also adding another boolean anywhere in the program also fixed the bug
[00:04:50] <ali1234> the correct fix though was to tell compiler that the other thing really really needs to be aligned no matter what optimizations are in use
[00:05:00] <ali1234> (it was something in the platform libs) 
[00:06:19] <ali1234> i'm not sure exactly why it needs to be aligned, probably something to do with PIO and DMA
[00:07:25] <ali1234> also i am not sure why the bug only happened when specifying Os for both C_FLAGS and CXX_FLAGS
[00:08:34] <ali1234> actually now i know the root cause that makes sense, if a C object added some stuff to bss and was not Os it would force everything following back into alignment
[00:08:50] <ali1234> so presumably some C variables between the boolean and the thing that needed to be aligned
[00:15:08] <cbreak> it was likely aligned
[00:15:16] <cbreak> and then the padding should have been somewhere else

[21:09:35] <teut>   how to fix these lines of code?  https://dpaste.org/qQFS#L23,24,25,28
[21:11:16] <teut> https://godbolt.org/z/Tvncbo6fh
[21:11:37] <teut> sorry, sometimes I forget that I need to use godbolt here
[21:12:52] <Alipha> `decltype(cmp)` and `Scheduler() : sleeping(cmp) {}`
[21:13:10] <teut> oh, right, I remove the template
[21:13:14] <teut> removed*
[21:14:46] <teut> is the top element the first element in priority_queue?
[21:15:28] <Alipha> yes
[21:15:39] <Alipha> well, "highest priority" element
[21:15:43] <teut> A user-provided Compare can be supplied to change the ordering, e.g. using std::greater<T> would cause the smallest element to appear as the top().
[21:15:48] <teut> this I just saw
[21:16:30] <teut> its confusing that a vector container is used here and it pops from left
[21:17:34] <Alipha> so in the underlying container, top would be the back element
[21:17:57] <Alipha> i've always felt that std::priority_queue's ordering was backwards, but *shrugs*
[21:19:13] <teut> I always get confused in this sorting business
[21:19:16] <teut> https://godbolt.org/z/TroPMvn4o
[21:19:44] <teut> I modified it and now it's saying   .push has problem
[21:19:53] <teut> I have changed it back to vector
[21:20:41] <teut> I want to remove smallest element, hopefully I am using the comparator as required for that

[21:25:10] <Alipha> ready is a container of lambdaT, but func is a lambdaTimePointT
[21:27:05] <teut> oh right, I wish the error said something similar but this debugging step would reduce my debugging time in fiture
[21:27:07] <teut> future
[21:28:58] <Alipha> i mean, you look at the "no known conversion from x to y" and see what the mismatch is between x and y
[21:29:10] <teut> is there any good naming convention for this types  ?
[21:30:03] <teut> lambdaTimePointT looks trash
[21:32:44] <Alipha> well, `lambdaT` is a bad typedef because it's just saying what the type is, not what its purpose is. in the context of a Scheduler, seems `Task` would be an appropriate name
[21:34:20] <Alipha> and std::pair is crap--don't use it. `first` and `second` are meaningless. create a struct/class with proper member names. struct ScheduledTask { Task task; std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::steady_clock> runAt; };
[21:34:59] <teut> ya, pair is useless, vector is better, I will change it later once it works
[21:35:58] <teut> and class  is all the more better
[21:36:32] <Alipha> ... and after you fix the lambdaT vs lambdaTimePointT discrepency, you get another "no known conversion from x to y", if you disect out the two types involved--perhaps pasting them into notepad so you can visually line them up--you'll see the difference:
[21:36:41] <Alipha> std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::_V2::system_clock, std::chrono::duration<long int, std::ratio<1, 1000000000> > >
[21:36:43] <Alipha> std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::_V2::steady_clock, std::chrono::duration<long int, std::ratio<1, 1000000000> > >
[21:37:39] <teut> ScheduledTask { Task task; std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::steady_clock> runAt; };    this tip is awsomeee
[21:41:01] <Alipha> yeah. again, don't use std::pair. create structs instead. and if you run into situations where you're composing together a few std containers, like std::map<int, std::vector<std::vector<Foo>>>, you should probably introduce some classes/structs for clarity instead, like std::map<int, FooMatrix> where FooMatrix contains a std::vector<std::vector<Foo>>

[22:32:47] <Alipha> teut: your cmp lambda
[22:33:20] <teut> in the cmp, isnt that ascending order sorting?

[22:35:12] <teut> ah right, it works
[22:35:31] <teut> thanks a lot, now I have a c++ project and I can apply for a c++ job
[22:35:56] <teut> I will make a producer consumer model and then it will be a good enough project
[22:36:13] *** Joins: bebyx (~Thunderbi@user/bebyx)
[22:37:35] <Alipha> < arranges in ascending order from lowest priority to highest priority and then priority_queue's top is the highest priority
[22:37:48] <Alipha> I agree that it feels backwards
[22:39:23] <teut> X)  it's confusing but I understood what you said
[22:40:00] <teut> I should have used a queue as a container

[22:40:55] <teut> I didn't know sort had this definition

[23:47:07] <teut> https://ibb.co/khFDpDF  how to import the schedular?
[23:47:11] <teut> scheduler*
[23:55:05] <Alipha> teut: use " " instead of < >. though also, you shouldn't #include .cpp files. and scheduler.cpp should probably be a header file (scheduler.hpp)
[23:55:43] <teut> header files are for the interface right?
[23:56:23] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d44f7e.access.ecotel.net)
[23:56:39] <Alipha> right... did you separate your Scheduler class into an interface and implementation?
[23:56:57] <teut> no, it's the the implementation for now
[23:57:03] <teut> just the*
[23:58:06] <teut> missing terminating '"' character [-Winvalid-pp-token] expected "FILENAME" or <FILENAME>
[23:58:27] <Alipha> #include "scheduler.cpp"
