[03:37:37] <nickspoon> Cool, it's a great tool ae? So exciting the first time you successfully debug without leaving your vim session
[03:38:13] <l__q> Yes, it works great, but I needed change my leader key

[03:39:58] <l__q> Now my Vim is like vscode, coc, breakpoints ^_^
[03:40:48] <igemnace> codebam: you might also want to immediately add the results to the quickfix: vim +copen -q <(rg --vimgrep foo)
[03:41:05] <l__q> but coc server with typescript on vim can by slow too like on vscode sometimes
[03:41:09] <codebam> igemnace: oh definitely not haha. there were like 50 files
[03:41:19] <codebam> but thank you
[03:41:41] <codebam> l__q: it can be slow but at least it doesn't block input
[03:41:48] <nickspoon> l__q: vscode and coc will be using the same server, so that's not surprising
[03:42:00] <igemnace> codebam: quickfix makes it manageable, actually, over vim $(...). see https://asciinema.org/a/177062
[03:42:07] <l__q> ok
[03:42:21] <codebam> OHH I see so it shows the file names

[03:44:04] <nickspoon> Ha, I have a :Grep command too, which runs ripgrep using :AsyncDo (not :AsyncRun like yours, igemnace)
[03:44:11] <nickspoon> Very similar workflows I think
[03:44:28] <igemnace> nickspoon: actually, i had since moved to AsyncDo too!
[03:44:54] <nickspoon> <3
[03:45:16] <igemnace> i was looking for a way to hack AsyncRun into using the loclist (i think it's a feature nowadays, but back then it was not), and i lost interest after seeing the plugin was a single 1000-line file
[03:45:53] <igemnace> then AsyncDo came out which was much simpler (although not as smooth as AsyncRun's on-the-fly addition to the quickfix), and it already had support for loclist, so i switched
[03:46:01] <nickspoon> AsyncRun's power is its ability to load the quickfix incrementally, right?

[06:37:58] <nova> igemnace, even the nixos normies agreed that nixos is great for maintaining backwards stability (ie, if you break something then you can always go back (unless you explicitly delete a build)), but it does poorly for forward stability (adding new packages or handling new inconsistencies). To me it felt very double edged: stable and unstable - just in different directions (past vs future, resp).

[06:44:39] <igemnace> nova: i see. coming from that experience, would you prefer arch for your daily driver over nixos? i'd been eyeing nixos, but i'm legitimately happy and at home with arch, not much complaints about the distro itself

[06:51:24] <nova> igemnace, it's subjective, but I feel as though nixos is quite niche. It felt like I was hopping from ice cube to ice cube in a tumultuous sea where people had organized the ice cubes in such a way that I could just keep stepping from one to the next. It was kind of fun. Then I hit a wall, and the rush ended. You should definitely set up a full nixos desktop for the experience if you have time.

[06:53:19] <nova> personally, I definitely prefer arch. Way more convenient, flexible, standard. For example, gcc isn't in your $PATH unless you start a nix-shell, so this broke my neovim when I did :TSInstall maintained ... it literally couldn't compile a C program that was like  #include <string>  ... so frustrating. I think there is a semi-easy way to fix it, but it was just ... totally wacky imo
[06:54:20] <nova> I am about to try gentoo. I used arch for five years and nothing else, so I am experimenting, and I think I am regretting it :P but we'll see how gentoo goes. It seems interesting and very customizable in more ways than arch, which is fun. Hopefully, it's stable and flexible and allows me to be productive *fingers crosssed*

[21:51:50] <audiophile_> ok i type in text 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy|' | is the cursor so I want it to be shown as '*** **** **** ***.... lazy'
[21:51:55] <habamax> and when you move your cursor next word should be visible..
[21:52:04] <audiophile_> kinda like a password field but not really
[21:52:06] <audiophile_> yeah!
[21:52:13] <audiophile_> or whatever i hover on in normal mode
[21:52:17] <habamax> conceal is syntax based
[21:52:18] <audiophile_> just the WORD
[21:52:23] <audiophile_> so thats a no

[21:53:10] <habamax> I doubt your mama knows vim

[21:53:21] <audiophile_> but thanks for confirming
[21:53:21] <habamax> oh sorry bout that
[21:53:37] <audiophile_> oh dw
[21:53:58] <habamax> you could try to hide your text with text properties though
[21:54:21] <audiophile_> .h text-properties
[21:54:27] <audiophile_> !h text properties
[21:54:32] <habamax> or with g?
[21:54:38] <audiophile_> rot13?
[21:54:42] <habamax> yep
[21:54:53] <audiophile_> yeah i was thinking of that too...that certainly is more viable
[21:55:18] <audiophile_> are the vim bots present in libra
