[00:33:22] <SineDeviance> anyways, is there a good way to image multiple linux partitions (i.e. an efi, root and /home partitions) into a single image file which can then be mounted or spun up in virtualbox?

[00:33:32] <toretto> >
[00:33:35] <phogg> A de-fanged sudo is a way to go, as opposed to removing it, when you don't need its gaping maw of a security hole.
[00:33:36] <SineDeviance> I know I can use cat or dd to do the entire disk or a single partition

[01:20:06] <rascul> i can do microsnorts without a machine
[01:20:16] <Dagmar> Since bash doesn't "do" floating point, mainly the only place the new numeric operators (-gt -lt) come into play are when you're trying to sort numbers or something like that
[01:20:17] <pasiz> i prefer microfarts
[01:20:17] <rud0lf> Dagmar: i think bash operates on strings only (character input) so there's no difference in representation of string of value "42" and integer 42 ... it's all about context

[01:56:05] <AsenM> Hello, folks! I have raid 5 that serves video files via nginx. But looks like there is a lot of buffering and overall the serving of files is pretty slow. Any idea how to diagnose and fix the problem?
[01:56:12] <Dagmar> s/easy/easier
[01:56:39] <Dagmar> AsenM: Are they being _played_ by a player, or just downloaded?
[01:57:37] <Dagmar> If it's the former, then you likely don't actually have a problem.
[01:57:42] <AsenM> Dagmar, there is "default browser" player that goes there when you open the file directly in the browser
[01:57:59] <pasiz> AsenM: could you describe system under your raid5 little better. Also raid5, is it controller based or software raid,
[01:58:00] <Dagmar> AsenM: Yeah very little will attempt to download an entire 3Gb video stream up front
[01:58:30] <Dagmar> AsenM: It's rather likely what you're seeing is the client only downloading what it needs to keep the video playing, plus a little extra in case of drops
[01:59:11] <Dagmar> Otherwise fire up iostat and maybe look into sar to spot if there's disk io bottlenecks

I have seen online where people do not recommend using btrfs on mechanical disks and I am wondering if this is because there is a performance penalty, or for a different reason

[05:17:54] <joelchrono12> yep
[05:18:04] <joelchrono12> the default theme is blinding white tho
[05:18:05] <jim> how do you like it?
[05:18:19] <jim> oh ok...
[05:18:27] <joelchrono12> I mean seems pretty feature complete
[05:18:50] <joelchrono12> and I dont mess around with commands for stuff like authentication and such. Since the GUI is pretty easy to follow
[05:18:54] <LjL> last time HexChat was meaningfully updated, "dark themes" weren't really a thing yet, except on terminal :P

[07:40:05] <z8z> Hello, i would like some help to understand the concept and good practices about some software installations in linux distros. For the web for example, most of the software versions of the packages delivered by the distros are unsupported and not recommended so we always have to install stuff with official scripts and stuff. What is the purpose then to have and maintain thos packages in the distro repos? And is it ok to ignore the distro packages and
[07:40:05] <z8z> use external one in production enviroments?
[07:40:07] <mmrakib> how do you solve debian's problem of being out of date?
[07:40:15] <wwalker> xous: yep.  in early 2000 I worked for Team Linux corp.  Linux consulting has no repeat customers!  It never breaks.  So charity or law firm, we charged them, because our solutions was 100x performance of windows and would not break in 30 days ....
[07:40:15] <[[R]]> mmrakib: don't use debian?

[07:42:06] <wwalker> z8z: good questions.  you should use the disro provided packages when you can, because they come with bug fixes and security fixes.

[08:05:53] <z8z> [[R]]: Safe means, reasonable safe xD (i mean the containers manager itself)
[08:06:00] <[[R]]> safe means safe!
[08:06:03] <z8z> *reasonably
[08:06:03] <[[R]]> of course, it's so simple
[08:06:20] <CoderCop> z8z: Containers can help isolate problems in one system to that system, but they can also provide a false sense of security. My big complaint about docker (which I use frequently) is that it's too easy to stand stuff up. Need a DB? Just standup a mysql container...without ever really understanding how it works. So, when something goes wrong, you don't really know how to fix it.
[08:06:36] <No1x3r0> you know, like when you slide into home and you're "SAFE!"

[08:08:09] <xous> and that's when it gets messy if you got a ton of cowboys setting up shit
[08:08:26] <sivert> sounds spicy
[08:08:36] <z8z> [[R]]: Just to make sure, Docker is the best container dude right? :D ...... Or something else or better is out there?
[08:08:41] <wwalker> and it just cost you hours.  dash is not enough faster to matter for ANYTING except, just maybe boot scripts. 70 milliseconds faster run time for an hour long rsync.  that is what you are getting from dash
[08:08:42] <CoderCop> [[R]]: Fair question. I think it's slightly different in that you are still seeing the software the way the devs (and the docs) intended. With docker, a bunch of the config files etc. are hidden and only what the docker image creator wants is exposed.
[08:08:46] <[[R]]> z8z: what does "best" mean?

[08:09:36] <wwalker> xous: if you unplug power, and ethernet, any melt the machine to homogenous slag, it is then relatively safe
[08:09:43] <xous> again it's like any tool. A skillsaw is a great tool but it'll cut through your hand just as easily as a board
[08:09:45] <Guest34> Bash just werks
[08:10:27] <xous> honestly, one of the main reasons I like having Linux servers is noobs generally won't fuck with them.
[08:10:44] <wwalker> Guest34: my apologies for going off on dash.  They also link /bin/sh to /bon/dash, and dash is NOT a functional bourne shell.  I've lost data and untold hours to the brokeness of dash.

[09:15:10] <xous> they screw up
[09:15:15] <xous> I mean I shouldn't
[09:15:28] <xous> I got paid $150 minimum when I went on site
[09:15:42] <SineDeviance> nah, the GS308 switches are super solid
[09:15:46] <No1x3r0> LOL this whole time I thought my friend was attending university in a city called Ontario; didn't realize it's a region *face palms*
[09:15:59] <SineDeviance> can't beat an 8-port gigabit switch with a metal casing for $20
[09:16:03] <xous> I finally configured port security on the switches and told the switch to disable the port if it saw more than one map
[09:16:10] <xous> No1x3r0: you know Ontario is massive, right?

[09:19:21] <xous> yeah, I'm just curious if they teach that in school
[09:19:22] <No1x3r0> xous honestly the most Canadian experience we get is hearing the song at Disney or something
[09:19:28] <xous> or just US states.
[09:20:02] <No1x3r0> xous not really I mean they vaguely show on a map for geography but little else
[09:20:18] <No1x3r0> or this is way back when when I went to school

[09:20:28] <No1x3r0> hadn't been to school in decades
[09:20:30] <xous> I spent weeks in the US for work
[09:20:46] <xous> it's funny how similar everything is
[09:21:12] <xous> although I'm pretty sure I accidently went into the wrong place in North Carolina
[09:21:35] <No1x3r0> I'm really embarrassed, I don't know why I thought Ontario was also a city
[09:22:09] <SineDeviance> I used to live in North Carolina (Charlotte), recently moved to South Carolina
[09:22:17] * No1x3r0 just realized how vague his friend was when telling him he attended university in Ontario 
[09:22:30] <xous> probably thought you wouldn't know where it w as :P
[09:22:46] <No1x3r0> guess he was right then
[09:22:48] <No1x3r0> LOL
[09:22:55] <xous> I was in Charlotte and I wandered into a steak house

[11:43:51] <hexnewbie> “I blame systemd” is a joke, it is likely a change in the kernel. I doubt systemd affects the behaviour if ifdown on the physical interface (i.e. triggering powerdown of the LAN card), as both 'ip link ... set down' and 'ifconfig ... down' do the same.

[12:08:01] <DPA> I don't use systemd. And no, don't be silent towards distro maintainers and others. There are more and more applications gaining dependencies on systemd. Some already don't work without it anymore.
[12:08:01] <DPA> And it does more and more things, using variouse tools, which either will not work without it, or may eventually no longer do so.
[12:08:05] <DPA> I am using linux to avoid lock-ins of any kind. I will never use or accept software that encourages or causes in any way any kind of lock-in.
[12:08:20] <TomyWork> the horror!
[12:08:40] <TomyWork> i like systemd. makes running your own daemons easy
[12:09:49] <DPA> There are many ways to achieve that without forcing anything onto everyone.
[12:09:52] <TomyWork> I have encountered edge cases in the real world that are impossible to catch in the old sysvinit paradigm and I'm glad I no longer have to deal with them
[12:10:50] <DPA> Sysvinit is by no means the only init system out there.
[12:11:00] <TomyWork> no one is forcing anything onto you. you can always go linux from scratch

[12:21:04] <DPA> Things where the kernel depends on systemd - the closest thing would be kms master mechanism. Obtaining kms master on a kms node requires root, even if a user has full access to a card node.
[12:21:04] <DPA> Logind manages kms leases and works as an intermediate to allow non root programs to become kms master after all, the kernel even mentions logind in the source code. Although, with seatd, an alternative for that is available.

[12:58:43] <DPA> Just look at the helper functions in libsystemd0. There are functions for tons of APIs all in that one library. How is a program supposed to implement just one of them, on a binary distribution? It's not trivially possible like this!
[12:58:43] <DPA> There needs to be some big thing abstracting the API mess away, so that they can be implemented individually, and at that point, we're back to the original problem, a big thing doing too much.

I tried running `ifuse ~/iphone_docs` but got `fuse: device not found, try 'modprobe fuse' first`. Running that command only gives me more errors.

[15:02:46] <bitplane> password=decryption key sorry
[15:02:55] <asgas> You can easily reset BIOS password by removing a battery and putting it back in.
[15:03:20] <gadfly> you could also read the bios chip password
[15:03:30] <gadfly> and if thats your crypto pass
[15:03:38] <gadfly> bye bye any security

[15:09:46] <asgas> If you have special files only that need to be encrypted, I don't think you need to encrypt the entire drive. You can encrypt select files only and keep the drive unecnrypted.
[15:10:11] <bitplane> so my requirement is for a piece of hardware in the machine to contain the key, so someone can't steal a disk and get access to the files
[15:10:44] <asgas> I don't know the name of it, but there's a special key you can buy to substitute as the encryption password.

However I am thinking that too mush I/O would cause hard disk wearing. Has any of you any idea on how this could be prevented. I would imagine to have it buffering traffic and start writing on demand. Any ideas?

[17:33:45] <varaindemian> MichaelLong: any idea?

[17:38:39] <boris[m]> And yes sorry , I didn't mentioned this in my first post :(
[17:38:48] <Shariff> Dagmar: now that is a rather arrogant position to take... if someone does not know better questions, because they haven't reached that skill level, too bad.. come back when you level up..really?
[17:38:49] <Psi-Jack> Most of them, in fact, are 2.5", I only have, presently, the one NVMe.
[17:38:49] <peetaur> boris[m]: ok then in that case it would wear the disks at a basically normal rate.... for a hard disk it means it affects whether the disk is spinning, and the motion of the heads, and magnetic effects on the media ... which eventually will make a disk fail; a good healthy disk without defects might live only 20 years instead of 200 if you use it in such a manner.
[17:39:01] <peetaur> and a seagate barracuda might last 2-3 years ;)

They do basically a lot of the same thing.
[18:00:53] <asgas> Psi-Jack, What plugins exist to make GNOME more like a traditional desktop do you suggest I should use to make GNOME better? Latest fedora comes with GNOME 40.
[18:00:56] <Psi-Jack> And Akonadi, UGH!
[18:01:05] <Psi-Jack> How NOT to do PIM/Email.
[18:01:09] <matsaman> asgas: "traditional" as in Windows-style?
[18:01:19] <matsaman> asgas: I would switch to Xfce and then change the panels a little
[18:01:21] <Minall> Psi-Jack don't use activities, I only use virtual desktops, didn't know they were different
[18:01:31] <Psi-Jack> asgas: Define "like a traditional desktop". Because nothing really defines that IMHO.
[18:01:42] <matsaman> GNOME aims to be macOS by default
[18:01:50] <Psi-Jack> matsaman: FALSE!
[18:01:53] <matsaman> Xfce caters much more simply to either world
[18:01:55] <matsaman> Psi-Jack: not at all false
[18:02:04] <Psi-Jack> matsaman: 100% false./
[18:02:07] <matsaman> no =P
[18:02:12] <Psi-Jack> That said, I made my GNOME /LOOK/ like macOS! ;D
[18:02:12] <Minall> asgas Gnome desktop is fine, but If you really want a traditional, maybe Ubuntu's changed gnome may be enough, or install task bar apps. Personally I would use vanilla gnome
[18:02:18] <Dagmar> asgas: Considering that GNOME keeps trying to "reinvent" the desktop as if no one ever used a computer before, the simplest way is to _isntall almost anything but GNOME_
[18:02:24] <matsaman> Psi-Jack: it looks like macOS by default =P
[18:02:28] <Psi-Jack> But, no, there's NO global menu in GNOME, and never will be, so that's definitely NOT macOS like at all.
[18:02:32] <Psi-Jack> FALSE!

[18:06:39] <superkuh> And not Gtk3 is forever broke and GNOME'd.
[18:06:43] <superkuh> Er, s/not/now/
[18:06:44] <Minall> For example, I tend to use 6 desktops, 3 I can navigate in with WIN+{1,2,3} and above them I have extra others that I navigate with WIN+S. This is easy configurable in XFCE or KDE Plasma, but in Gnome I'm stuck with their virtual desktops and keybingins, nothing I can change
[18:07:02] <matsaman> superkuh: I mean anybody can fork it from any version, but the trend is definitely odd, IMO
[18:07:04] <Psi-Jack> Minall: There's a reason behind it, too. You always have a focus workspace, that doesn't change, and a changing focus, that's the primary display where the desktop workspace pager is. You flip that around, but keep focus on what you're doing.
[18:07:21] <Minall> If I could find how to do my workflow in gnome, I would do it, but that will probably break with another Gnome release
[18:07:26] <Psi-Jack> If you go into it with such logic, it makes much more sense.
[18:07:33] <asgas> I haven't used GNOME in years. I guess it's worth giving another try today.
[18:07:44] <Dagmar> lol
[18:08:01] <Dagmar> Go ahead and start drinking.
[18:08:09] <superkuh> matsaman, there's a reason the IBM/Redhat devs (and mclassen) leave gtk3 in a broken state. It's terrible spaghetti code. I've spent half a year trying to patch my own gtk3 to get back the ability to paste into a new File->Open gtkfilechooserwidget.c dialog with minimal success.
[18:08:13] <Minall> Psi-Jack Wait, ok that's interesting... Can you elaborate further?.

[18:13:31] <Psi-Jack> Minall: I got explained a lot of this logic by someone of the GNOME PR team, not sure how to explain it in total, but, basically the idea was like I said, you have, for example, 2 displays, as an example. One has a virtual desktop pager, one stays static. The static one is for your primary focus, which changes less frequently than your context switching. You may have a focus but your context changes may lead you to switch to a browser, or another thing,
[18:13:31] <Psi-Jack> constantly, that's what the desktop workspaces are for on the other display.

[18:40:18] <bewees> Hi, do you recommend to disable IPv6 in a home network when you do not need it yet? I noticed for running certain services IPv6 makes sense so you don't need to do NAT and have a reliable TCP socket, but I don't need that at the moment and I am thinking to make it easier and just do legacy IP?
[18:40:22] <peetaur> sorta but the way those heirarchial 'agile development' companies work is they hire a bunch of clueless monkeys at the bottom, and then the least clueless leads the pack, and up it goes until the guy on top knows nothing about technicals, but manages to herd the animals most of the time, so it functions as a whole despite all the parts being inherently broken.
[18:40:45] <Dagmar> Actually, let's not, because liver failure is a thing and pretty much _every company_ has 5% of their staff falling for the crappiest phishing mails ever
[18:40:55] <Psi-Jack> bewees: Nope. I do not recommend that.
[18:41:00] <peetaur> but in this case, the QA not actually testing it, or not having a policy to test with dark vs light theme or whatever, is where the heirarchy failed

[18:56:01] <Dagmar> They were probably using ipv6
[18:56:32] <xous> the problem is when a client gets a routable IPv6 address but has no IPv6 connectivity

[18:56:56] <hexnewbie> (only reason I've disabled IPv6 through the sysctl switch is that I inherited a system where some genius used an IPv4-only firewall for security, and IPv6 could be easily used to get around it, so until someone tasked me with fixing the actual security on the system, I disabled IPv6)

[19:21:41] <hexnewbie> I just always use --protect-args , as the man page says this will become the new default in the future, so why not just force my way there.
[19:21:52] <peetaur> akk: without protect args, it's bash that interprets the rsync command that contains the args....maybe that command also has a ; and rm like Dagmar's example; but with --protect-args, rsync sends the file name parts of the command into stdin, into an already running rsync, not bash, so it can parse it without treating it as commands
[19:21:54] <rapha> in the gnome file manager, when trying mount a folder via SSH (i have an entry for it in ~/.ssh/config, which works fine from the commandline, both through ssh and sftp), it only says "Unable to access location. Connection failed". is there a way to find out WHY it failed?
[19:22:08] <hkm> i will eat lunch and be right back
