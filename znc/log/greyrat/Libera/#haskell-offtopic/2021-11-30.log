[01:51:02] <janus> i think a lot of people kinda agree but they don't wanna waste their time on it
[01:55:15] <janus> but if some random person says it, maybe it will have less impact
[01:55:37] <janus> already many prominent haskellers are working for crypto firms, so you'd need a prominent haskeller to counter them :P
[01:57:40] <Rembane> Someone needs to bring balance to the force.
[01:58:22] <Rembane> That was way more fun in my head than it was when I read it. Sorry 'bout that.
[01:59:11] <monochrom> Um, the 1st person said to bring balance, he kinda wiped out one side. >:)

[02:15:58] <dsal> I'm a bit tempted to work in cryptocurrency just because there seems to be interesting people doing interesting things.
[02:16:08] <dsal> Trying to avoid it certainly led me to an incredibly bad experience.
[02:16:33] <janus> i did work in cryptocurrency and it was technically interesting but i also felt weird because i didn't buy the ideology
[02:16:46] <dsal> Yeah, I could be you.  :)
[02:17:24] <janus> that's also what makes it an interesting intersection with haskell. to me, haskellers are idealistic in a way, they like it because it is cleaner, makes more sense
[02:17:56] <janus> when i got started with bitcoin, i also felt like it should make money much simpler, now it's all FOSS and so on, testable protocols 
[02:18:01] <dsal> A friend showed me ETH a while back and I thought the language was scary and horrific.  I told him they needed to get some Haskell people to at least make something sensible for writing contracts.  I guess he passed the message along.
[02:18:41] <janus> but even if you have nice tech, i don't think it will fix the inherent philosophy which suggests that the state shouldn't control money
[02:18:44] <dsal> I kind of liked playing with bitcoin when it was early.  But I don't really like money.
[02:19:19] <janus> i hadn't even thought about my position towards the state, but spending time in the bitcoin ecosystem gave me a bad taste in the mouth, i didn't wanna hang out with libetarians all the time
[02:19:43] <janus> my boss didn't have a concrete philosophy about how to organize society, all he knew was that he wanted to control his own money
[02:19:52] <dsal> That's my experience, yeah.
[02:20:08] <janus> ok, but at what price? i don't think it makes sense to dedicate my life to bitcoin without being sure that i won't bring about something worse
[02:20:11] <dsal> "I'm rich, leave me alone" is a perfectly natural philosophy if you're rich.
[02:21:07] <janus> well there are frugal bitcoiners too. digital nomads who left everything behind to start over in Berlins crypto scene
[02:21:56] <janus> they are probably rich, but i think many people would do it even if they weren't. i think actually more people do it because it is fashionable to be anti-authoritarian
[02:22:30] <janus> what does 'rich' mean anyway. any european is rich if they can go to El Salvador
[02:22:33] <dsal> Heh, in the US, we have several competing fashions.  :)
[02:23:10] <monochrom> It is fashionable to stay in one's echo chamber.
[02:23:58] <janus> but i didn't even necessarily feel like it was an echo chamber. i felt like they just didn't even consider the question of how to organize society
[02:24:14] <janus> it reminds me of 'but who will build the roads?'
[02:24:37] <janus> once i had a libetarian mock me for asking the question. i still don't know why the question can't be asked
[02:25:09] <monochrom> I would think that that describes an echo chamber.
[02:25:18] <dsal> The rich libertarian type likes to imagine that personal stash of wealth will be enough to cover any issues.  I can afford health insurance, etc...  (ironically, I'm having trouble getting people to build my roads).
[02:30:44] <janus> dsal: so how did you get a bad expreience just from avoiding the field? less interesting jobs available?
[02:30:57] <hpc> the rich libertarian ideal is that planet near the end of the foundation series where everyone lives alone hundreds of miles away from each other

[02:32:37] <janus> bummer. but some things you gotta learn the hard way. or at least, i wouldn't know how to teach someone how to pick a job
[02:33:01] <dsal> He's convinced he's smarter than everyone else, and really didn't like being asked questions.  Never had time to answer things like "can't we just do this the normal way?"  Allegedly "code wins arguments" but when I answered a code review request with a set of suggestions that made the code much easier to manage, safer, harder to get wrong, better tested, and fixed several bugs that were pointed out, he just closed the PR 
[02:33:01] <dsal> without comment.
[02:33:15] <dsal> Then asked someone else to terminate my contract.  Couldn't even bother to talk to me himself.
[02:34:19] <dsal> My list of people I'll never work with again is now up to two.  He's kind of young and would regularly apologize and ask me to be patient.  And then he just assholed off.  In spite of me having written the majority of the application in a rather hostile environment.  *shrug*

[02:35:23] <janus> dsal: but do you see (in retrospect) any clues that could have warned you? anything you can use in the future?
[02:35:56] <dsal> Oh sure.  It wasn't that hard once it got going, but the "be patient" thing made it seem like he was at least going to work on it.
[02:36:12] <dsal> And there was one point where he did at least make a clear improvement where he started micromanaging a bit less.
[02:36:41] <janus> dude probably didn't even use irc :P
[02:37:01] <dsal> Really bad forest-for-the-trees kind of thing.  I could make something *clearly* and obviously better with no question about that, but get held up for days arguing about whether the abstraction I used in my test is acceptable in the codebase.  Or the second or third rewrite of that test.
[02:37:42] <dsal> This is the thing where after several days of complaining about things like using `either` (which is banned for being "dangerous") nobody even noticed that my Transaction monad didn't ever start a transaction.
[02:37:50] <Rembane> :D
[02:38:58] <dsal> Some people just want to hire people who aren't as smart as they are.  Companies manage to succeed this way.
[02:39:25] <dsal> I don't think I'm smarter than people in general, but I do ask questions.  And may of them would get "we don't have time to discuss this, the users don't care about this detail."
[02:40:24] <monochrom> Hrm, I have a somewhat opposite thought that, instead, they want to hire smart people, but they have a distorted idea of "smart".
[02:40:42] <janus> it's interesting that you make it sound like his problem with you was that you were too smart
[02:40:47] <dsal> e.g., starting a new project from scratch with all new standards.  One tenet was "choose a formatter and don't let anyone discuss it" I'm like... ormolu actually slows me down regularly.  Can we *try* to discuss it?
[02:41:00] <monochrom> For example if you ask a smart question, well, in their view, if you ask any question at all, you must be dumb.
[02:41:03] <janus> i would have guessed pride, the problem was you didn't make him feel smart. he could have smart people working that don't ask questions, they are not a problem to him
[02:41:54] <dsal> janus: I'm trying not to, but the counter was that I'd end up placed in a discussion with the weakest person on the team -- didn't know Haskell well, didn't want to know Haskell very well, and if he couldn't figure out what something was at first glance, then it was a bad idea.
[02:42:46] <monochrom> For example if they give you a problem to solve, but it is an XY problem and not worth solving. Suppose you say it out a loud that it is an XY problem not worth solving, I will think that you are very smart, but there are people who simplistically think "you submit no solution, so you are dumb".
[02:43:11] <dsal> This is the guy who would regularly rant about "people think I don't understand X but I understand X very well!"  Like, OK dude, I'm glad you wrote a book on linear algebra, but I'm just asking why I'm not allowed to make your logger thing work where I need to log stuff.
[02:44:05] <dsal> monochrom: Yeah, but in this case, I got a whole lot of "solve this problem using solution Y" and I would do that and show how much more tedious it is and describe why it's wrong or something and mostly it's OK?
[02:44:22] <monochrom> Although, to be fair, at some point I conflate "smart" with "wise", and I value wisdom the most.
[02:45:27] <dsal> He invented a new way to do JSON and stuff (his largest contribution to the company on company time and doesn't mention the company).  Suggested I plumb it through his logger.  I'm like, holy crap this is a lot of work and it means we can't log anything that we don't do all this extra work on because you can't just throw a generic JSON instance on something to log its structure, now you have to write huge amounts of code.
[02:45:43] <dsal> I'm relatively dumb, but at least have some wisdom.  heh
[02:48:12] <dsal> Part of it is that conflicting definition of Simple mentioned earlier.  I think making ~3 nearly identical data structures and manually updating all three, the parsers, and the tests each time you want to add something isn't necessary and you can just have one with a type variable.  Junior guy thinks that's "complicated."  "Smart" guy wants more junior guys.
[02:48:34] <dsal> Meanwhile, I can't convince junior guy to even stop submitting code that doesn't compile.  I guess luckily, I don't have to anymore.
[02:49:50] <monochrom> In what company is it even acceptable to submit code that doesn't compile. What happened to due diligence.
[02:50:17] <janus> at least you can test stuff like that with the Joel point system ;)
[02:50:26] <DigitalKiwi> i totally did not buy 25 of bitcoin to get 25 on paypal while we were talking
[02:50:37] <monochrom> In USSR you could submit that kind of code and bribe someone to look the other way. That I understand.
[02:50:55] <DigitalKiwi> as long as bitcoin doesn't fall to zero before my next purchase i'm winninng right
[02:51:03] <dsal> This is using github's PR thing and they historically would just squash all commits on merge.  I asked them not to do that for mine because each one is meaningful and well documented.  So instead, he just makes a bunch of little things that don't compile and then has the last one compile and submits that.  But like, I use things like bisect.
[02:51:44] <dsal> janus: I'm not familiar with that one.  I saw a thing on reddit a couple of days ago describing various complexity measures.  None of them seemed to point to "having more code with more paths and more copying and more validation" is less complex.
[02:51:45] <janus> well if it's squashed on merge, bisect would work fine ;)
[02:51:45] <DigitalKiwi> hmm and even if it does go to zero it's break even lol
[02:52:17] <janus> dsal: this is what i was talking about https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/
[02:52:22] <dsal> janus: Sure.  I invited him to squash his own.  Just don't squash mine.  Each commit is meaningful, reversible, tested, and provides useful documentation.
[02:52:47] <dsal> ah, OK.
[02:53:08] <janus> i guess it a bit dated now since tooling has evolved 
[02:53:20] <janus> but when that list was written, i am sure they'd answer no on many of them
[02:53:39] <janus> my point stands , i think. there are some tech decisions like that that you could ask for during an interview
[02:53:53] <janus> and if they don't know what bisect is, red flag to you :P
[02:53:55] <dsal> Testing is weird because "smart guy" claims to be a professional at testing.  The Change of Concern (I guess, there wasn't any discussion) added a ton of tests, including future-proofing tests.  But also like, we had to use a test framework he wrote and named after himself which is BDDish, but misses the biggest point of the original BDD testing frameworks.
[02:54:17] <dsal> I don't mind guiding people towards a better future.  :)
[02:55:21] <janus> must have been https://github.com/NorfairKing/sydtest :O
[02:55:23] <dsal> It's hard to see how bad tech leadership is during interviews, though.  "Hey, are you an asshole micromanager who will always rule in the favor of the least skilled person on your team?"  Most people wouldn't say yes even if they did it.
[02:55:30] <dsal> I don't want to name people.
[02:55:40] <dsal> I do realize the details might be narrowing a bit, though.
[02:55:58] <janus> right right, i am not asking you to name anyone 
[02:56:06] <DigitalKiwi> i am
[02:56:09] <janus> just doing inferrence here, happens automatically in haskell channels :P
[02:56:10] <dsal> Though this hypothetical smart person is someone I'm not going to work with again and if anyone needs specific negative references, I can provide.  heh
[02:58:11] <dsal> But yeah, some things kind of unroll as you go.  I was helping one of the new people with a test that was just nested case after nested case marching off the right side of the screen.  Smart guy said good test code and good application code doesn't look the same and the ~2 line function I added to remove half of that code and keep it all on the same column is too much cognitive overhead for the reader.
[02:58:59] <dsal> Then I see the same thing in application code where you've got like, a page of function where a case starts at the top and another is near the bottom with a variety of stuff in the middle (ormolu 2 space indentation) and it's really hard to track.  So I make a similar suggestion and am told "I don't think there's anything wrong with code marching off to the right."  OK…
[03:03:36] <dsal> I don't really *need* to work, but it'd be cool to have something a bit fulfilling to do while covering some expenses.  Random cryptocurrency stuff may not be that at the large scale, but I'm not going to rule it out as something interesting to work on.
[03:04:25] <dsal> I've been super spoiled by spending a while only working with people who were smarter than I am (or at the very least, were seeking growth) and having really good leadership around me.  I forgot that that's not universally the case.  :)

[03:15:36] <janus> i wonder if it would make sense to just have a discussion about anything really, to see how they reason. like, could you argue for a controversial opinion like 'comments are bad, code should be self-documenting' and then see how they respond :P
[03:16:09] <janus> if you can't convince them that it was just a test, they are difficult to work with anyway :P
[03:16:35] <janus> or maybe just pair programming for 1h is enough to see if you click with them
[03:17:04] <Lycurgus> is this a wage labor situation?
[03:17:21] <janus> i had assumed so?
[03:17:27] <Lycurgus> bradyt-, made that comment in tw mostly for you
[03:17:56] <Lycurgus> janus, then why u gotta "click"?
[03:18:09] <Lycurgus> just do your job and they do theirs?
[03:18:33] <dsal> Lycurgus: In this case, their job seemed to be telling me to do my job again but using things they arbitrarily decide are simpler.
[03:18:50] <janus> Lycurgus: because there are jobs out there where you can actually enjoy work instead of struggling to work with people you don't like anyway
[03:19:04] <Lycurgus> and their not ur superior?
[03:19:13] <dsal> Where simpler == needs more repetition, or don't use banned dangerous functions like `either`
[03:19:21] <dsal> or `foldMap`
[03:19:35] <Lycurgus> i never understood even in the early days of it, why wage laborers buy into the bullshit 
[03:19:48] <Lycurgus> it's a transaction
[03:20:33] <janus> Lycurgus: you can always argue that a sufficient amount of money will fix this situation... it's a whole different discussion to decide what you want from life/work. my question is mainly just how you find out early if it's someone you wouldn't enjoy working with
[03:20:41] <dsal> Maybe.  I was hired for experience.  I was regularly asked to reject my experience and just do something that my experience tells me is worse with no explanation.
[03:21:08] <Lycurgus> people don't think well about fundamental things like social or belief systems or what not
[03:21:50] <dsal> People who think they understand things well often understand them the least. heh
[03:21:54] <Lycurgus> and this confusion, which if the capitalist/employer had would be fatal, i.e. not understanding the underlying relations
[03:22:35] <Lycurgus> to think somebody is paying you to have fun or whatever should at least give pause
[03:22:49] <dsal> You're free to have bad opinions, I guess.
[03:22:59] <janus> Lycurgus: imho you can have both  ;)
[03:23:11] <Lycurgus> especially paying you 3-5 times what low skill laborers who otherwise work under the same model make
[03:23:17] <dsal> I was hired because I'm experienced at delivering software.  I have a pretty good track record of doing that with millions of active users.
[03:23:25] <dsal> They were also paying me about half of what I was making at my last job.
[03:23:48] <janus> why don't we just go full-on pessimistic and claim that even romantic relationships are financial transaction. we have fixed dating!
[03:23:49] <dsal> None of this is the point, though.
[03:24:17] <dsal> They want something built.  They hired someone who could build it.  Then they complained about the person holding bricks with his left hand.  We hold bricks with our right hands here!
[03:24:23] <Lycurgus> well the markets are set by the major actors/capitalists who typicall earn about 5-10X what they pay the employee per professional head
[03:24:28] <janus> now i don't need grandpa to tell his bullshit stories about how he fell in love, we all know it was a lie. he just wanted to get laid
[03:24:40] <Lycurgus> so much smoke is blown up many naive young butts
[03:24:44] <janus> damn, my life has no purpose :O
[03:25:57] <Lycurgus> romantic relationship
[03:26:09] <Lycurgus> i think that's what I call the sex based love
[03:26:44] <janus> let's take it to the next step! life has not been defined exactly, so murder isn't defined either. ergo, there cannot be anything wrong with it.
[03:26:50] <dsal> It's a fairly narrow view to introduce sex into the definition.
[03:27:55] <Lycurgus> well that's what "romantic relationship" means in English, eros as opposed to agape, philia, storge, oder
[03:28:19] <Lycurgus> and it is a transaction, oftentimes financial
[03:28:35] <DigitalKiwi> janus: just let the AI pick your spouse no need to even date
[03:28:35] <Lycurgus> in addition to the other
[03:28:38] <dsal> I'm sorry for whatever happened to you that gave you such a sad outlook on life.
[03:28:54] <Lycurgus> i don't see it as sad
[03:29:03] <dsal> That's a defense mechanism.
[03:29:10] <Lycurgus> do you pity me for not believing in god and the like?
[03:29:32] <dsal> I pity you for reducing everything to a transaction.
[03:29:40] <monochrom> Ugh, next time please just answer "no" to "is it a wage labour situation?"
[03:29:56] <Lycurgus> it could be said to be a defense mechanism if I were young and didn't have experience of the thing
[03:29:59] <monochrom> Most programming positions are hardly wage labour situations.
[03:30:01] <DigitalKiwi> where's my money for having to read Lycurgus typings
[03:30:18] <janus> monochrom: i thought it would be a discussion about communism :(
[03:30:29] <monochrom> Most programmers actually have so much bargaining power and even control of means of production.
[03:30:29] <Lycurgus> no? do you mean being salaried means it isn't wage labor?
[03:31:10] <Lycurgus> i haven't been correcting typos, sorry
[03:31:11] <DigitalKiwi> lol i met someone who's a 70 hour a week salaried land scaper
[03:31:22] <monochrom> That's right. "salary" in name only. And salary isn't even the whole picture.
[03:31:26] <DigitalKiwi> gets payed for 40 hours ofc
[03:31:38] <DigitalKiwi> the owner is a lawyer
[03:32:14] <DigitalKiwi> insurance situation is 'it happened off the clock' lawyer pays cash lolol
[03:32:28] <dsal> The 40 hour part of the clock, I assume.
[03:33:27] <Lycurgus> i don't reduce everything to tx, but i do recognize the tx like things as such
[03:33:51] <Lycurgus> where there's a quid pro quo ... .
[03:34:00] <monochrom> Programmers can extort employers to upgrade hardware and over-spec every so often.

[03:34:50] <monochrom> Programmers can extort employers to pay for programmers' own mistakes. This is called "we need more time and more 'salary' to fix 'bugs'".
[03:34:56] <Lycurgus> programmers can do all kinds of things outside of the set of things that contradict the basic relationship with their employer
[03:35:05] <monochrom> If anything, programmmers are the exploiters and scammers.
[03:35:12] <Lycurgus> as that's defined in whatever jurisdiction
[03:35:51] <monochrom> The "salary" arrangement means that programmers get all the profits and the employer cushions all the risks.
[03:35:59] <dsal> Programmers are paid unfairly high in the grand scheme of things, but still always have to be paid less than the value they provide.
[03:36:15] <Lycurgus> that would be the case if the class of employers of programmers didn't basically view them as meat with a freshness date
[03:36:22] <monochrom> This is not the "wage labour" that anti-capitalist rhetorics is looking for.
[03:36:30] <Lycurgus> and lang bradings

[03:37:36] <Lycurgus> *to work whatever
[03:39:15] <Lycurgus> a lot of times I think that the real reason programmers salaries are high is the emotional labor and career track bullshit
