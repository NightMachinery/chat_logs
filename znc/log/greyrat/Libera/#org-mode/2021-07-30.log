[00:02:06] <Franciman> is there any limit to what it is allowed?
[00:02:16] <grym> not really.  you can drag in amsmath as usual :) 
[00:02:25] <Franciman> oh!
[00:02:27] <Franciman> damn cool
[00:02:34] <grym> https://github.com/io12/org-fragtog  you might like this sort of thing as well 
[00:02:37] <Franciman> so I suppose it is mostly related to backends
[00:02:41] <grym> yep
[00:02:49] <grym> you will certainly need latex laying around 
[00:03:07] <Franciman> I wanted to write a blogpost
[00:03:15] <Franciman> maybe I can use mathml or mathjax

[03:09:13] <grym> rdrg109: https://bpa.st/7HIQ  a few days ago i asked about how to do this (jump to the first heading on org file load)
[03:09:50] <grym> rdrg109: it is messy when it doesn't find anything, though 
[03:23:51] <grym> (it yells in the minibuffer if you open a blank file)
[03:42:41] <rdrg109> grym: I've noticed that because your function throws an error (when a heading doesn't exist), all the next hooks in org-mode-hook are not run. Just mentioning because I found it relevant.
[03:43:07] <rdrg109> Let me take a look and see what I can do
[03:48:33] <rdrg109> grym: Why did you use "back-to-indentation"? Is it because you want the cursor to be at the beginning of the line (if a headline is found)?

[05:53:34] <doug[m]> C-c . ?
[05:59:45] <zebrag> http://accidental-taxonomist.blogspot.com/2014/02/tagging-vs-indexing.html
[06:02:32] <zebrag> I think org tags are a bit cumbersome to use. For one thing they clutter the headline, you neither can use many or long ones. Another thing is they serve several purposes, like `export`.
[06:02:52] <zebrag> So maybe index is what I'm looking for.
[06:05:15] <zebrag> The above article seems to say when to use tags, and when it is possible to replace them by index entry.
[06:05:28] <rdrg109> doug[m]: I didn't know that existed, so I looked at the implementaion and came up with (org-insert-time-stamp (org-read-date nil 'to-time) :with-hm :inactive) which also does the job.
[06:05:41] <rdrg109> I guess, I will stick to C-c . Thanks for the help!
[06:06:49] <zebrag> "tagging involves any kind of designation about a piece of content, what it is or what it is about, whereas indexing is restricted to descriptive labels for what content is about"
[06:06:55] <doug[m]> No problem. Note that there are active and inactive timestamps in org, active show up in the agenda. 
[06:07:55] <rdrg109> zebrag: I used to complain about the aestethics of using tags, but now I really don't care about how long they are or how they make my document to look like, I just use them to find information quicker when searching.
[06:08:48] <rdrg109> I am just mentioning my preference just in case it is of help for you to decide your own convention.
[06:09:48] <zebrag> yes, I was about to say you became blind in the meantime ;)
[06:11:07] <zebrag> I think the article above will help me resolve the two many ugly tags problem. The quote i inserted 3 lines above is interesting imo
[06:11:23] <zebrag> timestamps are awesome btw
[06:15:46] <doug[m]> https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/32031/org-mode-hide-tags-in-outline-view
[06:16:26] <zebrag> Yes, I've forgot about that one
[06:18:43] <zebrag> `(setq :makeindex t)`
[06:19:24] <zebrag> that doesn't work a bit
[06:20:47] <zebrag> How do I set :makeindex?

[06:26:02] <zebrag> Though the answer is quite complicated
[06:34:27] <zebrag> You've got to have some elisp configuration somewhere. Like to set `org-publish-project-alist`. But I find very little on that subject. I find snippets, but not proper documentation about it.
[06:34:35] <zebrag> maybe I've just overlooked it

[18:32:22] <zebrag> I do have generated `theindex.{org,inc,html}` files. But none of them contain any of my index entries.
[18:35:37] <zebrag> I have found very little material on that subject on the internet. The keyword `makeindex` can be found in half a dozen pages on the web, most of which are mirrors of the manual.
[18:35:48] <zebrag> It is very frustrating.

[22:46:49] <rdrg109> grym: (org-map-entries (lambda () (outline-hide-subtree)) "TODO=\"DONE\"" nil). You might want to change the last parameter in order to limit the part in which the function act.

[23:00:31] <zebrag> yeah, I've found so much about all that in the meantime
[23:00:38] <zebrag> but still not enough
[23:01:02] <rdrg109> zebrag: I read all your messages, but didn't get what you are trying to accomplish, so what's your X problem? https://xyproblem.info/
[23:01:42] <zebrag> rdrg109: for instance I've used *scrratch* as suggested to there: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html
[23:01:57] <zebrag> rdrg109: no, it was definitely not an xy case
[23:02:21] <zebrag> not in the least
[23:03:17] <zebrag> So I was wondering where do you put your elisp code related to one specific publishing project if not in *scratch*?
[23:04:40] <rdrg109> What variables would you like to change in each project?

[23:08:14] <zebrag> base-directory
[23:08:28] <zebrag> but yes, maybe, since recursive is set to t

[23:09:44] <rdrg109> base-directory is not a variable that I know of, at least it is not listed in M-x describe varaible.

[23:10:27] <zebrag> org-publish-project-alist

[23:14:20] <rdrg109> zebrag: That's right, org-publish-project-alist stores the configuration of multiple projects. You can set :base-directory, :base-extension, :publishing-directory, etc for each project. org-publish-project-alist has the following form (setq org-publish-project-alist '((PROJECT-1 CONFIG) (PROJECT-2 CONFIG) (PROJECT-3 CONFIG)))
[23:17:27] <zebrag> nice, nice, you should learn how to walk before run ;) I think I missed all the elementary steps
[23:18:02] <zebrag> next step make it a gitlab page
[23:20:42] <zebrag> btw, I think I do not need to use `(require 'ox-publish)`, not sure why
[23:20:50] <rdrg109> Oh, yes, I would also like to try that. My Emacs configuration (as well as the configuration of all the software I use) is written in Org mode files, so I would like to publish them in a site so that I can share my config with other people.
[23:21:33] <zebrag> but I do need (require 'org-id)
