[00:00:07] <celphi> even with header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); doesnt work
[00:00:25] <celphi> but works with curl so it cant be a server issue
[00:01:16] <silly> paste the error message
[00:01:46] <celphi> it seems i only get an error when i add the header `"Content-Type":"application/json", `
[00:02:18] <silly> can you click on the request in network tab and see the response?
[00:02:42] <celphi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/dafUQ4O0/image.png
[00:02:44] <silly> i mean response headers...
[00:02:54] <celphi> sure sec
[00:03:32] <celphi> so on first one where it says CORS error- there's no response header
[00:04:02] <silly> do you need authentication for this request?
[00:04:34] <silly> or authorization or w/e
[00:05:16] <celphi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/hVlq3kej/image.png
[00:05:27] <celphi> is from the 2nd one
[00:05:32] <celphi> no authentication
[00:08:46] <silly> weird that it says 404
[00:09:29] <celphi> no idea what "preflight" means either

[00:09:57] <silly> it's an additional request done beforehand
[00:11:07] <silly> when i saw that once, the browser did an options (preflight) request to see what it was allowed on the server

[00:11:39] <celphi> why would taking out "Accept: json/application" in my JS make it not error
[00:12:20] <silly> authorization was involved in what i did back then and i had to set the cors header explicitly to the domain where the request came from. * wouldn't work

[00:19:01] <celphi> it's whenever i take out `"Content-Type": "application/json" `
[00:19:11] <celphi> it doest error when i send aajax
[00:20:19] <silly> that is when you respond without `"Content-Type": "application/json"`, there is no error in your browser?

[00:21:57] <systemfault> It means that they're probably not handling preflight requests properly.
[00:22:08] <systemfault> (Handling OPTIONS request on their backend)
[00:22:18] <celphi> in fetch(domain, { method: "POST", headers: { "Accept": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify({ login: 123 }});
[00:22:31] <systemfault> An error should be visible in the network tab
[00:22:32] <celphi> works but if i add the content-type header it doesnt
[00:22:48] <celphi> yeah systemfault you see my image 10mins ago?
[00:22:51] <systemfault> Yes, simple requests don't need a preflight request
[00:23:18] <systemfault> Nope, I only look at the window 4-5 times an hour... because work :/
[00:23:54] <celphi> ok so right now-- if i make my server reply with json_encode([4]) it works by replying with [4] but if i try to json_encode($_REQUEST) i get an empty array as if the data is not posting right
[00:24:43] <systemfault> celphi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request
[00:25:05] <systemfault> By changing the header, you go from a simple request to a preflighted one.
[00:25:38] <celphi> i see
[00:25:39] <systemfault> So, fix your backend... properly handle OPTIONS request.

[00:52:09] <cthulchu> I don't understand the idea behind defer. Is it possible that an external async script gets loaded before dom is ready?
[00:52:14] <cthulchu> that's odd
[00:52:27] <cthulchu> also, will defer work with async?

[00:59:39] <systemfault> Normally, <script>s block when they're loaded... so if the DOM element their code targets are not loaded at that point in time, it won't work
[00:59:42] <seed0> cthulchu: from my understanding, it's about order, deferred scripts are only loaded after all other resources are loaded (html, css, other non-deferred scripts). Async scripts are different in that they are loaded as soon as theyre finished downloading
[00:59:55] <seed0> oops
[00:59:56] <seed0> lol
[00:59:59] <systemfault> "defer" will push the execution of those blocks after all the DOM is parsed.
[00:59:59] <seed0> systemfault: got this
[01:00:04] <cthulchu> no, I want something more certain
[01:00:17] <cthulchu> systemfault, parsed? so after dom ready?
[01:00:27] <cthulchu> after it's rendered and available for JS?
[01:00:34] <systemfault> "defer" will ensure that all the deferred blocks will be run in the order they were in the document.... "async" doesn't give a shit about order
[01:00:41] <seed0> ^
[01:00:45] <seed0> well said
[01:00:54] <cthulchu> then how is it different from sync?
[01:01:17] <systemfault> cthulchu: sync? You mean "normally"?
[01:01:22] <cthulchu> ye
[01:01:35] <systemfault> The code is executed when it's encountered
[01:01:46] <cthulchu> and in sync?
[01:02:18] <austincheney> my preferred approach is to shovel everything into a callback that fires on an event, such as the load event, and checks that a flag is set in the page validating everything is parsed and ready
[01:03:24] <systemfault> cthulchu: Maybe I should have been more clear about something hmm..
[01:03:28] *** Joins: sickdyd (~sickd@120.51.82.69.ap.gmobb-fix.jp)
[01:03:29] <cthulchu> ok, so deferred implies async download, but execution is on dom ready I think
[01:03:36] <systemfault> Yes.
[01:04:04] <cthulchu> so if my script heavily parses DOM, then defer is a good way to ensure there's no racing with DOM
[01:04:15] <systemfault> There's never racing.
[01:04:55] <systemfault> When the page is loaded, normally, all script tags block the page while their content is loaded
[01:05:14] <systemfault> Unless... they're marked as "defer" or "async"
