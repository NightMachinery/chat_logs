[02:09:56] <velix> jochum: I think it uses port 9000 on default?
[02:10:02] <sney> dob1: or if you're using a java runtime that's distributed as tarballs, they might be supported by java-package, and you could just install it as a deb

[02:12:07] <jochum> velix: ofc
[02:12:09] <sney> dob1: sure, that works too. java is handled by alternatives anyway so switching what /usr/bin/java points to is a breeze

[11:29:11] <alex11> the way that post read it looked like "it's bad because your shell may be compromised" or something
[11:29:16] <alex11> not in terms of restricting users
[11:29:17] <Khepra> the question here is not about validity of using vim as root, but validity of the reddit post stating it's a potential vulnerability through rich editor features
[11:29:41] <Khepra> and yes, basically, any software used with enhanced privilege might have its flaws exposed and exploited
[11:30:23] <Khepra> vim in particular has metacommands that may be embedded in files (so called vim modeline for example)
[11:30:34] <NiLon> clearly any program could have some fatal bug that melts your whole computer
[11:30:44] <NiLon> so anything you run as root has the *same* problem
[11:31:08] <Khepra> indeed. and some programs more, and some less. programs with rich control surface, like vim, in particular.
[11:31:49] <NiLon> but chance that something like nano has security vulnerability that would cause a problem is slim to none
[11:32:08] <NiLon> vim/emacs with third party plugins etc. could be a risk tho
[11:32:21] <NiLon> do you truly ever know what they do
[11:33:06] <Khepra> that's the issue.

[11:37:04] <NiLon> and like 10 years ago there was a issue with nano that if you did run nano as root and edited a file then another local user could modify permissions of the temporary backup file it creates
[11:37:27] <NiLon> tho using that requires that you have 1. local access already to normal user 2. timing

[14:56:05] <punkgeek> I've encrypted my whole disk with LUKS and I've installed Busybox with the network configuration. So when VM has been rebooted, I can connect to Busybox with SSH to enter my LUKS password.  I want to run the wget command automatically after the initramfs network is configured, to know the VM needs to enter the LUKS password, how can I do that?

[14:59:03] <Khepra> punkgeek: not sure I understand what exactly you want to do with wget, but you can write initramfs-tools _hooks_ which are scripts that are executed during creation of initramfs for the purpose of installing binaries, libraries and configs into it

[15:00:00] <Khepra> punkgeek: but.... at that point... why even bother with password entry? just set up a "key server" which your initramfs will wget or curl the key from and auto-unlock as long as your keyserver permits it.

[22:26:30] <jhutchins> jasonwc: The rule is that if you've modified a config file, you'll at least be asked before it is overwritten.  If you haven't modified it, it gets updated without asking.
[22:26:42] <jasonwc> Makes sense
[22:27:52] <jmcnaught> Sometimes you want to avoid getting prompted at all, which is where drop-ins come in handy because instead of editing a file you are adding a new one that the package manager won't try to replace.
[22:29:27] <jasonwc> Yeah, that's what I was referring to.  Some applications have a package-provided config and then there's a directory to store user-modified configs, which will automatically override the default config

[23:35:28] <jmcnaught> mattb0ne: I would try a newer kernel and firmware packages from buster-backports, or maybe upgrade to bullseye.  The Intel site says your CPU came out in 2020, a year after Debian 10 was released
[23:35:37] <amacater> Also possibly kernel 5.10 or so from Buster backports - or yes, update to Bullseye
[23:35:59] <amacater> At this point, if you're just installing, I'd be tempted to try bullseye-rc2
[23:36:06] <sney> mattb0ne: when following up on an existing issue, it helps to say what you already tried, so people don't tell you to try the same things again :)
[23:36:18] <sney> mattb0ne: anyway, have you tried using the intel xorg driver instead of modeset?
