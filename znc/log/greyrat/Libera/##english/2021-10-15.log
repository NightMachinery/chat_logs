[05:04:24] <furrykef> It's using "pack" in the sense of packing luggage. It's not a phrase one would usually say
[05:04:45] <chlorine> furrykef: i know what "pack" mean.
[05:04:52] <chlorine> furrykef: that's why i asked.
[05:05:08] <furrykef> *shrug* You asked what the phrase means, and I just told you
[05:05:19] <chlorine> i'm perfectly fluent in English. i'm just asking for the interpretations because clearly the literal meaning doesn't make any sense.
[05:06:00] <furrykef> It's semi-literal... it means "bring your wife" but it's treating her like an object rather than as a person
[05:06:46] <chlorine> furrykef: yeah, right.
[05:08:14] <chlorine> furrykef: did you even listen to the song?
[05:09:54] <LuisP18> like, in the same sense as packing some muscles, or some such
[05:10:01] *** Quits: Alex123 (~Adium@69.234.46.106) (Quit: Leaving.)
[05:11:04] <chlorine> if you've listened to the song, he's talking sarcastically about the perils in Cambodia due to the dictatorial government.
[05:12:20] <chlorine> i think that the phrase "pack a wife" means that he'd be so exhausted and starving over there that having his wife with him might provide a little bit of warmth and support. i think he's talking about that with a bizzare twist of packing her like luggage as one is going to a vacation.
[05:12:22] <furrykef> I didn't listen to it, but I read the lyrics and I even clicked the text and read the annotation on that genius.com page
[05:12:29] <chlorine> furrykef: yeah.
