[18:09:44] <GuiToris> hello, I've been struggling with delays and hopefully I will understand everything now
[18:11:01] <GuiToris> One of qaac's description says 'Every MDCT codec including AAC has encoder delay by design'
[18:11:09] <GuiToris> how does ffmpeg handle this type of delay?
[18:11:49] <GuiToris> qaac writes the information into iTunSMPB
[18:12:23] <GuiToris> or I can just trim the amount of delay from the beginning, it's been a dilemma
[18:12:25] <JEEB> depends on the container
[18:12:31] <GuiToris> mp4, this time
[18:12:32] <JEEB> mp4 has edit lists which are utilized by default
[18:12:37] <JEEB> if you encode with FFmpeg
[18:13:03] <GuiToris> I'm about to remux them, and I don't know which version I should keep
[18:13:42] <GuiToris> I have a normal version and a no-delay version
[18:13:58] <GuiToris> "--no-delay means that necessary priming samples are not encoded in the result, so first 20ms or so cannot be correctly reconstructed"
[18:14:36] <GuiToris> I examined the files and the results were mixed
[18:14:57] <GuiToris> so I guess it depends on the media player
[18:16:17] <GuiToris> in some audio editors the files weren't aligned, in Audacity for example they were
[18:17:11] <GuiToris> I really don't know what to do, in theory ffmpeg cares with iTunSMPB information
[18:18:23] <GuiToris> if I transcode and audio file to aac with ffmpeg, how does it compensate the delay?
[18:18:41] <GuiToris> does it also write the delay information into iTunSMPB?
[18:18:47] <JEEB> it gets negative timestamps and the edit list for that track tells whatever plays it to ignore the first 1024 samples
[18:18:57] <JEEB> or whatever the size of the priming samples is
[18:19:03] <JEEB> (usually with AAC it's 1024)

[18:20:51] <GuiToris> I'm only going to encode the video with ffmpeg now and keep the audio -c:a copy, would you use the one that has delay information in iTunSMPB?
[18:22:01] <GuiToris> Should I just hope that the mediaplayer knows what to do with the delay information?
[18:22:51] <galad> just a fool's hope
[18:23:29] <JEEB> I don't know your files
[18:23:34] <JEEB> I cannot blindly tell you what to do
[18:23:59] <JEEB> you want to check what FFmpeg does with iTunSMPB and if it passes that the same way through as an encoder's delay gets passed

[18:26:04] <GuiToris> it's really hard to verify 22ms with a media player

[18:33:00] <GuiToris> is there any way you could check my files? They are 1s long Original: https://www.dropbox.com/s/c5107i9c778y2c5/Original_trim.wav?dl=0 Qaac: https://www.dropbox.com/s/y76bcn1jgdcgs2p/qaac_trim.m4a?dl=0 Qaac+no-delay: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2v1nz8g1kuywyts/qaac_nodelay_trim.m4a?dl=0
[18:33:37] <GuiToris> they look ok, nodelay missing 2000 samples from the beginning
[18:34:24] <GuiToris> if they remained in sync, then I should use that version that has all the samples
[18:35:09] <GuiToris> but is it up to the media player? some player will play it well, while others won't?

[21:18:49] <jamra> Does anyone here know why the DTS at the beginning of MP4 video streams is so high, but only for the first packet?
[21:19:01] *** Joins: Volgaar (~volgaar@193.137.116.78.rev.sfr.net)
[21:22:37] <JEEB> jamra: check with advanced_editlist being set to 0
[21:22:43] <JEEB> (it's an mp4 reader option)
[21:22:58] <JEEB> sounds like a boog in any case, but that might make it better depending on what is funky
[21:23:08] <JEEB> alternatively check the values with something like L-SMASH's boxdumper
[21:23:14] <JEEB> which dumps the contents of the structure
[21:24:03] <jamra> It's just weird. First packet's PTS is 0 and DTS is 18446744073709551109
[21:24:15] <jamra> Maybe the video was not encoded right. idk.
[21:24:41] <jamra> I'll go check the vals
[21:24:58] <galad> maybe it's a signed int and not an unsigned it?

[21:32:43] <JEEB> jamra: is it positive or negative_
[21:33:09] <JEEB> in other words, is it AV_NOPTS_VALUE
[21:33:27] <JEEB> but check the advanced edit list disablement
[21:33:33] <JEEB> that is some really borked google code
[21:33:40] <JEEB> that other bits of google then file bugs on :P
[21:33:47] <jamra> You are right. It was negative
[21:33:54] *** Joins: someuser (~user@197.54.30.120)
[21:38:54] <jamra> the dts started at -507
[21:39:09] <jamra> Probably because it was a clipped mp4 file
[21:39:30] <jamra> clipped by twitch, not by me
[21:40:32] *** Joins: thebombzen_ (~thebombze@64-233-244-163.static.clv.wideopenwest.com)
[21:41:09] <JEEB> you can then compare the result against ffprobe's -of json -show_packets and L-SMASH's boxdumper :)
[21:41:27] <JEEB> plus I do generally recommend disabling the advanced edit list feature, just in case that improves the numbers
[21:48:28] <jamra> Ok thanks.
[21:49:03] <jamra> The starting DTS's are negative because I'm taking twitch clips. They are clipping by the PTS most likely. Definitely not reencoding. Just clipping at a keyframe I think. So the first DTS's are broken.
[21:49:15] *** Joins: anotheruser (~user@s178255151130.blix.com)
[21:49:35] <JEEB> negative DTS is not really invalid per se
[21:49:43] <JEEB> DTS just needs to be smaller or equal to PTS

[22:06:09] <jamra> I see.
[22:06:15] <jamra> So it's actually okay to make it negative
[22:06:19] <jamra> So long as it's monotonically increasing
[22:06:25] <JEEB> yup

[22:07:03] <JEEB> of course it depends on the container whether re-adjustment is required. mp4 for example is fine with it, but there are some where the values are positive only or start always with zero or whatever
