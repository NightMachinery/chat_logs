[02:51:25] <hoppity> By the way I've confirmed that the default behavior for multi selects in phoenix sends nothing to the params unless an item is selected (makes sense). This is the reason why having several multi selects on the same form causes them to all be marked as "can't be blank" as far as  the changeset is concerned it hasn't received any info about those multi selects.

[06:29:36] <hoppity> rawtaz, haha could be
[06:30:54] <benwilson512> hoppity: this is a common issue if you aren't capturing form changes with phx-change
[06:31:31] <benwilson512> at least your first issue. if checking one box checks multiple then you likely have duplicate DOM ids
[06:31:54] <benwilson512> adding phx-ignore in these cases isn't really a solution, it's gonna just introduce its own issues
[06:38:24] <hoppity> benwilson512, the issue with the checking multiple things was when using multiple-selects. I can't remember the DOM ids though. Now that I moved everything from multi selects to checkboxes random boxes would popup all over my form and the checked status of my checkboxes would not be reliable unless using phx-ignore.
[06:39:02] <benwilson512> hoppity: I would run your page through an HTML validator. every time I had that sort of issue it was cause I was creating invalid HTML
[06:39:05] <benwilson512> missing closing tags and so forth
[06:39:14] <benwilson512> which tends to cause chaos with morphdom
[06:39:47] <hoppity> that makes sense, I will do that. What issues do you think I can bring about by using phx-ignore? so far it seems to have solved mt problem completely.
[06:40:09] <benwilson512> it means you are unable to change the contents within it from live view
[06:40:34] <benwilson512> this will prevent things like phx-change from working as you expect if you have form elements inside the ignored block
[06:41:40] <benwilson512> gotta run though, later!
[06:41:43] <hoppity> benwilson512, I only have a couple of checkbox group but I don't anticipate needing to change the value of said checkboxes from my liveview. I could be wrong of course.
[06:41:55] <hoppity> benwilson512, I will still run my page through an html validator of course
[06:42:18] <hoppity> benwilson512, thanks for your advice have a great day!

[07:19:12] <hoppity> I'm leaving too but came to say that I found this tutorial where the writer mentions using phx-ignore so that checkboxes don't lose their state as well. As benwilson512 said earlier, phx-ignore might not be the right way to go but there is evidence of users of the framework resorting to phx-ignore due to the strange behavior presented by checkboxes. Cheers everyone. Link here: https://fullstackphoenix.com/tutorials/add-bulk-actions-in-phoenix-liveview

[18:33:34] <whk> i realise you can't modify a struct, but meant %{foo | bar: "new"}. we had our fist major bug where %{date | day: new_day} was coded and the new_day was 0, so things started falling apart. learnt the hard way to always use Date.new in the future. 
[18:34:21] <Nicd> there's not much you can do about it

[18:47:37] <Nicd> one thing I do with structs is that I use `%Struct{foo | bar: 1}` syntax, then it would have been more visible not to do `%Date{date | day: new_day}`, and it provides compile time guarantees against wrong keys

[22:23:01] <adidas> I'm trying to use alpine.js with my Phoenix project following this blog post: https://dockyard.com/blog/2020/12/21/optimizing-user-experience-with-liveview. I've added alpine.js to my package.json but x-data isn't initializing a variable and events aren't firing, so it seems alpine.js isn't loaded in the client. Everything works when I use
[22:23:01] <adidas> alpine.js via direct CDN URL in a <script> tag, it just doesn't when I load it through my app.js. Any ideas on what might be going on?
