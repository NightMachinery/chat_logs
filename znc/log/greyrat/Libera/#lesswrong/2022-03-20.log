Or the anticipation of having a dog in the room.
[01:59:42] <capisce> so the dogs have to be disguised as robots
[01:59:48] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Not a fan. I don't actually comment my code very often. I'll write up a separate design document, sure. But I'll rarely if ever actually write comments in the code.
[02:00:33] <gwern> quanticle: the dogs may be there already as 'service' or 'emotional support' dogs, so it's not like it really introduces anything qualitatively new

[02:03:09] <spxtr> you just separate it out of the air, no? not super rare
[02:03:23] <quanticle> Yeah, but the equipment to do so is, kinda
[02:03:33] <spxtr> airgas had an issue at a plant in russia (unrelated to the war) and so helium is mega hard to get these days
[02:03:51] <quanticle> I think we had this discussion before, somewhere.
[02:06:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Counterpoint: fear of dogs is perfectly rational, fear of needles just makes you a wuss
[02:06:48] <quanticle> Yep, it was in here:
[02:06:52] <quanticle> 2022-02-11 16:43:17 <quanticle> Yeah, I was just reading an article about how South Korean steel mills have gotten into the neon business: http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220112000640
[02:06:54] <quanticle> 2022-02-11 16:49:10 <quanticle> ggreer: In theory any place that liquefies air can distill neon; in practice, you need the actual distillation equipment to separate the neon. From what I've read, that's

[02:06:56] <quanticle> difficult, because neon is such a small fraction of the atmosphere.
[02:07:03] <gwern> bah, I'm not afraid of dogs. I know how to fight them

[02:08:42] <gwern> quanticle: first, I have many backup strategies beyond that. second, the second one doesn't involve oolong *at all*
[02:09:20] <spxtr> do they need a specific isotope or something?
[02:09:29] <spxtr> that's mega expensive if so
[02:09:46] <quanticle> I don't think so. I think it's just because neon is rare, and doesn't accumulate at the top of gas wells like helium does.
[02:10:06] <quanticle> Helium self-concentrates. Neon has to be concentrated.
[02:10:24] <gwern> (I wouldn't be shocked if they needed a specific isotope, everything in chip manufacturing is absurd, but the article didn't specify that)

[04:00:55] <quanticle> Ah, okay. I didn't realize you were a user of Universal Analytics.
[04:01:40] <saturn2> which kind of analytics do you get by default?
[04:03:06] <gwern> loads of stuff. URL referrals, web browser type, screen size, device type, time on page, time in session, new vs returning...
[04:03:14] <gwern> one is spoilt for choice in GA
[04:03:29] <gwern> it can be pretty tricky figuring out how to express a slice in the GUI but usually it's possible

[04:07:18] <gwern> the problem is probably the migration

[04:12:27] <gwern> one can only imagine how much GDPR etc have complicated the codebase
[04:12:59] <kuudes> maybe there is a gdpr reason
[04:13:03] <quanticle> I might have mentioned this earlier, but my dad works for Wells Fargo. Recently he told me about Wells Fargo's new cloud initiative. Apparently they're going to some kind of hybrid model where their operational systems (i.e. the ones handling the data coming back from processing transactions) will be on Azure, and their analytics systems will be on Google Cloud. He was asking me if this seemed
[04:13:05] <quanticle> sensible, and I told him that they were going to look up one day and find out that their egress fees alone are into the seven figures and they're having to constantly update their shit to stay ahead of Google's deprecations.
[04:13:06] <kuudes> for deletion of the data
[04:13:25] <kuudes> quanticle, nice
[04:13:30] <nshepperd> they had an sorts of galaxy brain strategies for dealing with gdpr
[04:13:49] <gwern> quanticle: I'm also now thinking about GDPR and every single tinyminded bureaucrat who thinks that adding a requirement about data physical location is the beesknees
[04:14:12] <gwern> just how many jurisdictions will the bits go through 'twixt Azure & GCP...
[04:14:13] <quanticle> But hey, if they want to light a bunch of money on fire, it's none of my... actually it is because Wells is a Systemically Important Financial Institution and has an implicit guarantee from the US government (as of the Great Financial Crisis)
[04:14:15] <kuudes> worked re microsoft
[04:15:10] <saturn2> banks hosting their transactions in the cloud sounds like a terrible idea
[04:15:26] <quanticle> gwern, nshepperd: I'm not sure that this has to do with GDPR at all. I don't think Wells does a lot of business in Europe. I think this is the result of some architect hyping hybrid cloud to some suit who doesn't know servers from sashimi
[04:15:49] <quanticle> But yeah, I look forward to the upcoming money bonfire
[04:15:49] <gwern> and yet, not being in europe doesn't save me from spending a nontrivial fraction of my life working around cookie popups
[04:15:55] <quanticle> At least it'll keep my dad employed.

[04:24:05] <quanticle> kuudes: Yeah, the problem here isn't that it's multicloud. The problem is that it has none of the advantages of multicloud. Wells Fargo is going to putting systems in one cloud which are dependent on systems in another cloud. So if either cloud experiences issues, the whole pipeline fails. It's like... the multicloud equivalent of RAID0
[04:25:00] <kuudes> you could make a cluster out of virtual servers and then try to use the promised total amount of memory? :D
[04:25:05] <quanticle> lol
[04:25:05] <gwern> "It is an unusual request, but we finally did it, sir. we found a cloud architecture which will minimize your uptime and ensure six nines of unavailability" "I think there may have been a typo"

[04:26:48] <saturn2> the whole point of a cloud is that you can't see anything when you're in one
[04:27:37] <kuudes> as long as you are in a cloud, you just experience pleasant weightlessness and don't fear the upcoming crash

[11:26:17] <saturn2> no just the part where you have a guild that declares you competent without having to prove it to everyone separately
[11:26:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, we already have that, even if I dislike it. It is called FAANG
[11:26:56] <quanticle> Right, but the problem is that the moment you have such a guild, you've started the credentialism spiral
[11:27:31] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Not wrong lolsob
[11:30:55] <quanticle> Except what saturn2 has in mind is more like, once you pass the test, you don't have to demonstrate technical qualifications any more. You just sit down and talk to people and if they like you they hire you.
[11:32:43] <PapuaHardyNet> it would be nice to have a standardized test to demonstrate minimum technical ability. Kind of like a GRE for software devs. I worry that it will be weaponized by employers though.
[11:35:18] <quanticle> It absolutely will be. Just look at how universities treat SAT scores, with different thresholds applied to different groups depending what discriminatory criteria they're using at any given time.
[11:35:52] <PapuaHardyNet> You might ask - why isn't the SAT and GRE weaponized by universities then? Well, for one, universities aren't incentivized to get maximum utility from a person in exchange for giving them a minimum benefit. The incentives of universities are complex - ranging from prestige, government funding, to social signalling. Students - at least not grad students - aren't expected to *contribute* in any way other than financially, and the 
[11:35:52] <PapuaHardyNet> institution is not a monolith (see political issues between professors and admin, professors and professors, et cetera)
[11:36:09] <quanticle> The SAT is *absolutely* weaponized by universities!
[11:36:11] <quanticle> See above
[11:36:35] <quanticle> Harvard admitted to having different thresholds for different racial and ethnic groups when it was sued
[11:36:59] <PapuaHardyNet> isn't that orthogonal? Say you are Asian. Now you need to compete with other Asians for the Asian quota to get into Stanford, and that's where you need a much better SAT score than the average freshman
[11:37:58] <PapuaHardyNet> now compare that with jobs. Do you think employers will have Asian quotas where Asians have to compete with each other to get the highest DEVELOPER score to get the job?
[11:38:09] <PlanckWalk> Sure
[11:38:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course
[11:38:27] <quanticle> No it isn't because if you set up quotas like that, and predicate admission based upon test scores, then you're saying that the minimum academic ability needed for a black person to get into Stanford is lower than the minimum academic ability needed for an Asian person to get in to Stanford.
[11:38:38] <quanticle> Google already does

[11:41:48] <PapuaHardyNet> that's what you see with this exponentially scaled difficulty in technical interviews

[11:42:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,2066.msg58069.html#msg58069 ... this opera review might interest/amuse you
[11:42:36] <Robomot> Evan's reading - logs, thoughts, reviews [Evan Þ on January 03, 2021, 07:07:33 am: Today I finished Prisoners of Geography, by Tim Marshall (nonfiction, philosophy). Nations' policies are fundamentally influenced by their unchangeable geographic facts. This's the fundamental thesis of the book. It sounds obvious when baldly stated, but it bears repeating, and some of the implications Marshall points out I …]
[11:42:37] <capisce> but if there was something akin to a SAT, would most companies still choose to use quotas?
[11:42:46] <quanticle> Yes
[11:42:52] <quanticle> I mean, look at universities
[11:43:04] <quanticle> They won't call them quotas, of course
[11:43:44] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, hold on, let me try steelmanning your argument
[11:43:47] <quanticle> They'll say something like, "We're committed to maintaining a diverse workforce," but the effect will be that certain groups will have to have much higher test results and certain groups will get in with much lower test results.
[11:43:57] <capisce> universities have different priorities than companies
[11:44:14] <PapuaHardyNet> you believe that the increase of illegibility forces employers to hold a more complex evaluation of the employees? The "complexity of value" thesis?
[11:44:20] <quanticle> Companies' HR departments are staffed by people who graduate from universities.
[11:45:29] <capisce> fair enough, companies also have to deal with public opinion
[11:46:40] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: I believe that increasing legibility on the part of the worker will allow companies to reject qualified workers without giving them a chance to gain an internal advocate through face-to-face interaction.
[11:48:20] <quanticle> The way I see it, forcing companies to at least interview people before they reject them is preferable to giving companies yet another mechanism by which they can reject people without even interviewing them.
[11:49:11] <PlanckWalk> Ehhh ... they can easily reject before interview now.
[11:49:20] <PlanckWalk> (And very frequentlydo)
[11:50:04] <quanticle> True, and a standard developer test would make it even easier for them to do so
[11:50:11] <quanticle> Why do I want that?
[11:50:14] <PlanckWalk> The only real difference is that they'll be more likely to reject *unqualified* candidates.
[11:50:22] <PapuaHardyNet> by qualified workers, you mean workers who have the skills and experience to thrive as a developer, but not necessarily the credentials.
[11:50:29] <PlanckWalk> vs the qualified ones that they more frequently reject now.
[11:51:20] *** Quits: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[11:51:56] <quanticle> It depends on what you mean by 'qualified'. The kind of test that PapuaHardyNet is alluding isn't like a medical board exam or a bar exam. Those are pass/fail. What he's alluding is more like a SAT or GRE. The test merely yields a score, and it's up to the specific company to set its own pass/fail thresholds to determine who is or is not qualified.
[11:51:57] <PapuaHardyNet> The one reason I would agree with you is that the CS and software is moving so fast, and there's such a huge benefit to being generally intelligent, that standardized tests will reflect only outdated and irrelevant metrics
[11:52:22] <PlanckWalk> That is definitely a good point.
[11:53:02] <saturn2> you're all instantly taking the employer's side against yourselves, like programmers always do
[11:53:13] <saturn2> it's really amazing
[11:53:30] <PlanckWalk> Of course, the fact is that they frequently make candidates do ad-hoc standardized tests anyway, at much greater expense to the candidate.
[11:53:31] <quanticle> And the problem I have with that isn't really with the existence of the test or even companies having different thresholds for whom they'll accept. The problem I have with that is that such a test, in the context of the current culture in the United States, is likely to lead to more discrimination against me.

[11:55:05] <quanticle> saturn2: What can I say? The false consciousness is too strong!
[11:55:17] <saturn2> yep
[11:56:01] <saturn2> we are all eating from the trash can all the time *sniff*
[11:56:07] <PlanckWalk> Easier mobility between employment isn't "against ourselves"
[11:56:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Coding interviews are definitely against ourselves
[11:56:24] <PlanckWalk> Except in the sense of the concept of working for other at all.
[11:56:41] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[11:56:49] <PlanckWalk> I'm against coding interviews, greatly.
[11:56:59] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: sounds like the test should be an iq test then
[11:57:00] <quanticle> I don't disagree, Obormot\Arcturus, but at the same time, I think a credentialist process like what doctors go through would be worse.
[11:57:27] <quanticle> What we have is bad, but it can always be worse.
[11:57:59] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: I'm pretty sure my mistake here was not thinking through how irrational things can be. I've decided quant is correct.
[11:58:04] <quanticle> Wow
[11:58:07] <quanticle> Uh, thanks
[11:58:18] <PlanckWalk> Last time I was job hunting, when one of the prospective employers sent me a task to solve to advance to interviews (which woudl probably take about 2-4 hours to solve), I sent them a quote for the labour involved and asked if they wished to proceed.
[11:58:28] <quanticle> And how'd that go over?
[11:58:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Well, I certainly won't argue that things can't get worse... seems like they could get better, too, though
[11:58:36] <PlanckWalk> They obviously declined.
[11:59:32] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Yes, they could get better. As nshepperd alluded, we could just have IQ tests. But, once again, given the current culture and the focus on the lack of women and minorities in computer science, what are the odds of that?
[12:00:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Low... though there are other options
[12:00:24] <PlanckWalk> I just hope that they thought about their processes a bit more, or at least got a laugh out of it.
[12:00:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Really, the big win would be to make firing someone much easier, so that the hiring process doesn't have to screen against bads so intensely
[12:01:07] <capisce> looking forward to early retirement in a couple of years
[12:01:14] <PapuaHardyNet> huh? I thought getting fired is very easy in US
[12:01:19] <PlanckWalk> Isn't firing someone almost trivial in most places in the US?
[12:01:24] <PapuaHardyNet> see?
[12:01:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> No
[12:01:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Definitely not
[12:02:11] <PlanckWalk> (Hiring a replacement, on the other hand...)
[12:02:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or, rather, you can of course fire someone trivially, but you can't *actually* fire someone trivially, because what if they sue you?)
[12:02:49] <saturn2> your goal should not be to get an internal advocate or to make sure people's skills aren't outdated, it should be to make it so hundreds of different employers are begging on their knees to hire you and rolling out the red carpet for you if you show the slightest sign of interest
[12:03:06] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Yeah, and hopefully with more remote work, that will become easier. One of the problems in pre-pandemic tech was that firing someone was pretty inhumane if they spent significant time and effort to move to where the company was located. It's like, you convinced this person to uproot their entire life for you and you're dumping them six weeks after?
[12:03:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, perhaps that will contribute positively
[12:07:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Fundamentally my problem with hiring practices is this: if the process of proving to prospective employers that you're worth hiring is totally disjoint from the process of doing useful work and producing value, that's a broken state of affairs
[12:08:31] <quanticle> Yes
[12:10:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: In a healthy profession, the question of "why are you worth hiring" just shouldn't arise. Nobody asks this of plumbers, teachers, etc. In most professions, an interview checks for things like "do our/their expectations for the proposed employment contract match (and what can we do to make them match, perhaps)" and also "let's make sure this person is not insane or otherwise obviously and grotesquely unsuitable to
[12:10:50] <Obormot\Arcturus>  working here"
[12:11:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> But "prove to us that we want to employ you" is an absurd thing for an interview to be about
[12:13:18] <PapuaHardyNet> my current assumption is that this is caused by all tech companies cargo-culting the haughty attitude that FAANGs could credibly portray because the benefits of being an employee of those companies was/is so huge
[12:14:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or, to look at this from the other hand: if you've been working at some other job, or for that matter getting a college degree in CS or w/e, and your activities, and the output thereof, do not serve as a clear answer to "why are you worth employing", then *what the fuck are you even doing*)
[12:18:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Now, that seems somehow wrong, doesn't it? Ok, with the college degree part of it you can say "yeah, good point, they don't make you do anything useful in those programs, so people come out of them not having done anything that makes them obviously useful", but the job thing, something seems off about the logic, right? But what is it? You can spend years at a software dev job, all the time feeling like you're doing real work
[12:18:09] <Obormot\Arcturus>  and being productive, yet then somehow at the end if an employer looks at this and says "this doesn't really tell me anything", you nod and go "yeah fair enough, hard to tell wtf I was really up to, over there" - right? But does that not seem crazy, when looked at in this broad way...?)
[12:22:09] <PapuaHardyNet> "Although I am somewhat concerned about the degree to which there’s a sentiment that you need to be able to connect to the Internet so you can run your AI on Amazon Web Services using the latest operating system updates, and trying to not do that is such a supreme disadvantage in this environment that you might as well be out of the game. I don’t think that’s true, but I’m worried about the sentiment behind it." micro arms race

Sam is a neuroscientist and popular author who writes on topics related to philosophy, religion, and public discourse. The following is a complete transcript of Sam and Eliezer’s …)
[12:22:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or how about this: in many professions, the primary question, and the one that might perhaps have some aspect of illegibility, is "is this person competent". Right? Our proverbial plumber, teacher, etc., they can't point to any, like, *artifact* that they've produced - they're not architects, or designers, or surgeons who can say "as a matter of public record, I've done these-and-such surgeries" - they can only say "I've
[12:22:23] <Obormot\Arcturus>  worked for this many years doing this-and-such", which *is* a thing you can verify, but perhaps they did it *poorly*? But how is this solved? With references, right? You call up their previous employer and you say "hey, John Doe worked for you, is he good at stuff, or is he bad?" and they say "oh, he's good! the best!" and you go "cool thx" and you hire him.
[12:22:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> But in tech, this somehow doesn't help - why not?
[12:23:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> What can you get out of an interview that you can't get by calling up a previous employer and asking a question?
[12:24:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I mean a "skill" interview, not the more general sort of "how much money do you want and are you ok with dogs because our office has a dog" stuff)
[12:25:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's weird, honestly, that you almost never see these very basic and (to my mind) obvious questions asked in the interminable arguments about coding interviews and shit like that
[12:25:43] <saturn2> i think everyone understands that it's not really important whether the software gets written or not
[12:26:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that's definitely one of the big open secrets behind the whole thing
[12:26:30] <PapuaHardyNet> huh? what's the important thing
[12:27:36] <saturn2> competing over status
[12:27:38] <PapuaHardyNet> (clearly you don't mean product / business / marketing / sales - you either meant social affinity or perhaps some other divergent goals that large companies have - perhaps managers want to fill in a headcount, or we need diversity hires)
[12:28:07] <capisce> more headcount = more prestige
[12:28:13] <capisce> but you also want that headcount to be easily manageable
[12:29:08] <capisce> profits are determined more by monopoly positions than by individual developer performance
[12:29:48] <capisce> and anyway mid-level managers aren't that incentivized to maximize company profits
[12:30:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: In tech you're rarely in a situation where a job needs to get done and so you need to hire people to do that job. Instead, the job doesn't really need to get done, so your hiring has no particular reason to be motivated by such mundane concerns as "is this person able to do this job" "does he know how to do this job" "will he effectively do this job", because, again, the prior existence of some tasks that need
[12:30:59] <Obormot\Arcturus>  to be completed isn't what motivates you in the first place
[12:31:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And in parts of tech where this characterization fails, precisely there do you find a more "traditional" set of hiring practices)
[12:34:55] <PapuaHardyNet> really interesting.
[12:35:51] <saturn2> much like in the late soviet union, jobs are created according to the personal whims of bureaucrats rather than to serve any practical need. but unlike the soviets we're not smart enough to just show up and spend all day getting drunk
[12:36:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well, we do get paid quite a bit more
[12:36:46] <capisce> instead we show up and browse reddit and HN, chat on IRC
[12:36:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work", right? But here it's "they actually pay us, so we have to pretend to work more convincingly"
[12:37:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We might even have to convince ourselves that we're working, in fact! It might drive us crazy, wreck our health, etc., but you know what they say about believing your own lies being the most effective way to convince others"
[12:38:14] <saturn2> hm yes good point
[12:39:48] <capisce> too bad school and employment has conditioned us to pretend to work to the point where it's hard to be actually productive on things we care about

[14:35:57] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, the AI and Compute paper I linked clearly explains how easy it is for someone with enough money and compute to train a 100 trillion parameter model *today*. sure, reading gwern's scaling essay made me understand scaling, but it didn't prove with hard numbers that one can make a 100 trililon parameters model literally now if they wanted to
[14:49:29] <PapuaHardyNet> In general, here's how I see things going: with every year that passes, the minimum resources, knowledge, skill, and connections required to do AI research that has a non-trivial impact upon the future will continue to increase
[14:50:08] <PapuaHardyNet> It's kind of the opposite to the fragile world hypothesis where the amount of these four things required to cause massive damage significantly decreases with each passing year.

[15:34:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> "... the "Golden Age of Hijacking," from 1961-1973, when - without any airport security or defense -  hijackings took place up to every week, to the point where airlines equipped every plane with landing instructions at Havana airport just in case they were hijacked there" ... oh wow
[15:34:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I sort of vaguely had a sense that airliner hijackings were a thing at some point, but goddamn
[15:35:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Similarly, the high profile and political ties of this hijacking make me understand how the government and airlines finally installed security screening, and how the public accepted it.  It was expensive; it was a huge imposition on passengers; it still is.  But, after one man with a gun and homemade bomb extorted millions of dollars and set off a multi-day odyssey to Algeria in the name of the Black Panthers - and after
[15:35:46] <Obormot\Arcturus>  hundreds of people were regularly doing smaller but similar things - people thought it was worth it.  After enough chaos, people will be tired enough to accept a lot.
[15:35:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then, hijackings were no longer a thing that happened.  Dissaffected people wanting to make their mark in history no longer fixated on it.  And (though Koerner doesn't talk about this), they went on to do other things."
[15:36:47] <capisce> such as edgeposting
[15:37:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Yes, the media was pretty definitely encouraging it.  One of the things that was clearly publicized was how the airlines all had official policies not to resist any demands, whether flying to Cuba or ransom or (occasionally) even getting another plane in place and letting the hijacker transfer passengers at gunpoint.  All this continued because nobody ever actually got hurt in a hijacking, except when the poorly-trained FBI
[15:37:43] <Obormot\Arcturus>  once tried to intervene, got in a shootoff, and ended up killing an innocent passenger.  The only actual costs were ransoms to the hijackers (once they got the idea of that) and ransoms to Cuba for getting the planes back (there was a process and standard price.)  There really weren't any risks to the hijacker, and the risks to the airline were manageable till someone got the idea of demanding ransom and then other hijackers
[15:37:44] <Obormot\Arcturus>  tried to one-up him with higher dollar figures and more exotic destinations."

Koerner, "The astonishing true tale of a troubled Vietnam vet and a mischievous party girl who skyjacked their way to new lives.")
[15:38:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The airlines tried a limited form of behavioral profiling at the ticket counter, but not much else - and that had a bit of success in reducing hijackings, but they continued.  The problem was that the airlines were terrified that actual universal security screening would be super expensive (it was) and hugely discourage passengers (it didn't, because by the time it finally got in place, everyone was fed up with hijackings.)
[15:38:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> And once security screening worked, the airlines kept their "cooperate with all however-outrageous demands" policy in place for the next twenty-eight years... until the next set of hijackers decided to use the planes as guided missiles."
[15:39:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: Can't blame the guy, home cooking is one of life's true pleasures
[15:39:33] <capisce> "Yet graphic news reports about this brutal treatment did little to slow the epidemic’s spread. Every skyjacker was an optimist at heart, supremely confident that his story would be the one to touch Castro’s heart. The twenty-eight-year-old heir to a New Mexico real estate fortune hijacked a Delta Airlines jet while inexplicably dressed as a cowboy; a sociology student from Kalamazoo, Michigan, 
[15:39:39] <capisce> forced a Piper PA-24 pilot to take him to Havana because he wanted to study Communism firsthand"
[15:42:43] <capisce> "The hijackers included a former mental patient accompanied by his three-year-old son; a community college student armed with a can of bug spray; a Purdue University dropout with a taste for Marxist economics; and a retired Green Beret who claimed that he intended to assassinate Castro with his bare hands."
[15:44:48] <two2thehead> I've heard of being a Mama's Boy but this is ridiculous :V 'he could no longer bear to live without his mother’s delicately seasoned frijole'
[15:45:57] <capisce> "Then, starting in '69, you had hijackers demanding to go other places. The first was Raffaele Minichiello, a Marine who demanded to be flown from Los Angeles to Rome. And the airline complied with his request. So you had hijackers saying, wait a minute, we don't have to just go to Cuba. We can go anywhere! You have people demanding to be taken to Algeria and North Korea and Sweden and Argentina, and 
[15:46:03] <capisce> other different locations on the map."

[15:46:38] <capisce> "In 1970 you had the extortion phase. Hijackers start asking for exorbitant amounts of ransom. And again, the airlines comply with them. The airlines' policy was comply totally, and if you do that, that increases the odds that the plane will be safe, and the passengers will be safe, and we'll get the money back."
[15:48:04] <capisce> "The Federal Aviation Administration had an anti-hijacking task force, and they did solicit ideas from the public. They got these amazing ideas. The ones that pop to mind, and this is one they took seriously, are things like, "Build a fake Jose Martí International Airport in South Florida, pretend you're landing in Havana, and arrest the hijackers when they get off the plane.""

Hospitals at that time did not treat such small babies, but her father knew someone who did.

[15:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "By one estimate, Couney saved the lives of 6,500 infants. His decades of caring for premature babies has been credited in the development of neonatal care in hospitals. But by the early 1940s, interest in Couney’s exhibition had waned and hospitals were beginning to open units dedicated to the care of premature babies. Couney died in 1950, at age 80. At the time of his death he was reportedly broke, but he was memorialized
[15:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus>  in The New York Times as “the incubator doctor.”" ... very cool

[19:03:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And real AI is impossible. Q.E.D.
[19:03:14] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: it is typically a lot easier to use a powerful AI to create a weaker AI than vice-versa. like all the sparsity and distillation stuff. the industrial workflow is to create the most powerful model you can, and then use that to create the model you atually want to deploy on smartphones etc
[19:03:32] <PapuaHardyNet> okay that makes sense

Whenever I...)
[19:04:09] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: eg when you talk to your smartphone or Google Assistant and it talkes back, you are talking to WaveNet, but not (last I read any research on this) the *original* wavenet. because it's too damn slow. you are instead talking to the wavenet model's smol son
[19:04:41] <pompolic> don't convolve me or my son ever again
[19:05:05] <two2thehead> gwern, iirc the same applies to facebook's facial recognition ann
[19:05:16] <gwern> (1D causal convolutions, yes, for training the original, and then I believe it uses depthwise or smth for the highly parallel 'wide' wavenet it actually runs)
[19:05:16] <two2thehead> only they didn't release it to the general public
[19:05:29] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so to great powerful enough tool AIs we may require agentic AIs / superintelligent tool AIs, which are dangerous
[19:05:36] <PapuaHardyNet> s/to/to get/
[19:05:55] <gwern> yes. there's a severe bias towards powerful->weak, whereas weak->powerful is a lot harder. see also Jones RL scaling paper
[19:06:41] <gwern> you can boost a weak NN up a decent amount of ELO by spending on search, but if you want to go more than that, very rapidly diminishing returns, and the more you deploy it, the more expensive it is to substitute search for training
[19:07:15] <gwern> if you are only going to play a few games, well, maybe nbd. if you are going to deploy at google-global scale, that search suddenly becomes astronomically expensive compared to tpus-go-brr

[19:08:28] <gwern> that alone got him the anthropic job
[19:08:33] <PapuaHardyNet> sheesh, that's really cool
[19:08:49] <gwern> apparently just extremely unusual to see self-motivated research projects like that
[19:10:25] <gwern> (I didn't think it was all *that* unusual myself because it's the sort of thing I do all the time. maybe that's why people seem to find me more impressive than I find myself? "he's just this guy, who... does all this stuff. not even a grad student or google brain researcher!")
[19:11:33] <pompolic> it's like people wait for permission to find things out for themselves
[19:11:47] <PapuaHardyNet> It is super hard to do research - and making original contributions that aren't trivial, and doing it alone -- that's 99.9999 percentile thing
[19:12:32] <pompolic> sure yeah. i don't do research because my time and funds are going towards more pressing things
[19:13:03] <pompolic> well i say that but 
[19:13:06] <gwern> yes. it sounds so arrogant and self-congratulatory. "oh, I and Jones are special because we aren't *mindless sheep*, we are *freethinkers* who don't need *permission* from THE POWERS THAT BE". but, er, the more I get experience with people telling me they admire how I just plop down some poetry and fiction along with all the AI research on my webpage, or how amazing it is Jones could do some...

[19:14:29] <pompolic> gwern: yeah for a long time i didn't express it because i thought people would reply with the era-appropriate form of "cringe!" or r/IAmVerySmart
[19:14:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: That's in FF... and in Chromium: `Scroll position is now 943px. (Viewport is 983px tall.)`
[19:15:34] <pompolic> but that is in turn also stupid! imo
[19:15:56] <pompolic> that == "cringe!" and other thought-stoppers
[19:16:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Oh, and it's even worse if you click the scrollbar: `Scroll position is now 860px. (Viewport is 983px tall.)` (Chromium; in FF it's the same either way)

[19:17:46] <gwern> pompolic: I wasn't thinking cringe, although I am well-aware if I talked about this probably someone would use it against me, but more that it seemed like an obvious cognitive bias and one should ignore any such thoughts
[19:17:49] <pompolic> i guess it's a simulacrum level difference: "surely you're complaining about lack of willingness to DIY to elevate yourself by implication"
[19:17:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: That's multiple page-downs, surely?
[19:17:57] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yes, 3 each
[19:18:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Right. And obviously that is not 3x the viewport height!
[19:18:17] <gwern> (at least, I tried. the web dev stuff sometimes messes with the window edge and height etc)
[19:18:22] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: another heads up, the grammar feels off in this line in the Tool AI essay: "an intelligent, never mind superintelligent Tool AI, will have built-in search processes and planners which may be quite intelligent themselves, and in ‘planning how to plan’, discover dangerous instrumental drives and the sub-planning process execute them."
[19:18:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So, yeah. Browsers, eh?
[19:19:00] <two2thehead> kuudes, gwern how's the progress been on other non-Covid19 vaccines? I'd heard a lot about groundbreaking research being done but it all seems to have dropped from the news
[19:19:16] * gwern doesn't entirely understand why there are so many log entries when he tried to hit only PgDwn 3 times
[19:19:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, scrolling is continuous
[19:19:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the listener is called once per animation frame
[19:19:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (More or less. It's weirder than that but whatever)
[19:20:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Anyway, I dunno, perhaps 80% of viewport height is a good threshold? That seems like it'd do it, on mobile, at least?
[19:20:25] * Obormot\Arcturus tries it
[19:20:45] <gwern> maybe also a timeout? like after 30s, do you really need to keep seeing it?
[19:21:53] <pompolic> gwern: oh yeah. i'm saying i recently identified this bias in myself and started ignoring such thoughts
[19:22:35] <pompolic> but it'd have felt rude if i just said "lol ignore it" instead of trying to describe it abstractly
[19:23:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: A timeout after what exactly
[19:24:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Anyway, made the scroll distance change
[19:24:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now lunchtime etc. Afterwards I'll work on this other stuff

[20:43:38] <gwern> anyway, as if it was not obvious, definitely not anything remotely like a random sample of the russian population. which is fine, some random siberian peasant leaving isn't a big deal for putin. all the AI experts fleeing is a different story
[20:44:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Lika Kremer, a forty-four-year-old media executive, and her partner, the thirty-eight-year-old podcaster and editor Andrey Babitsky, attended a protest in Pushkin Square on Thursday night.

Just not possible to not go to a protest
[20:44:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Babitsky did get detained, along with several hundred other people, but he was held only briefly. The next day, Kremer and Babitsky flew to Venice for a seventy-fifth-birthday celebration for Kremer’s father, the violinist Gidon Kremer."
[20:45:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> "They arrived in a strange state.

[20:46:36] <PapuaHardyNet> "As a result, Russia’s AI development has been left to a state-owned bank, Sberbank, which has taken the lead in devising plans for government-backed investment in AI." so basically Sberbank is all that matters re: Russia AI experts https://sites.tufts.edu/hitachi/files/2021/02/1-s2.0-S0030438720300648-main.pdf

[20:47:06] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: yes, it's a little odd. why not yandex?
[20:47:15] <gwern> just not trusted enough?
[20:47:39] <gwern> sberbank only started showing up recently and I definitely thought it was odd. "ah, so this is russian and... sberbank? what?"
[20:48:36] <PapuaHardyNet> "The government’s distrust of Russia’s largest tech firm, Yandex, has sidelined the company from national AI planning." that's what is claimed, yeah
[20:49:14] <gwern> it's definitely weird. how can Yandex not be trusted after all this time? everyone assumes they are totally penetrated and controlled by the state
[20:49:47] <gwern> this smells like one of those things you only learn the behind-the-scenes a decade later, if that. did Yandex try to revolt? move offices outside Russia?
[20:50:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Sberbank and Yandex are direct competitors
[20:50:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sberbank owns Rambler
[20:51:04] <PapuaHardyNet> "Despite Yandex’s status as Russia’s leading tech firm, its uneasy relationship with the Kremlin may limit its interaction with Russia’s government and other state-owned firms. Yandex is privately-owned, which the Kremlin views as a threat. Putin has insinuated that the Americans who helped found Yandex and still serve on its board of directors are agents of foreign influence." nani
[20:51:25] <gwern> sure, but yandex has much more of a history in AI. they have great facial recognition, image classifiers, even iirc a decent self-dirving car program
[20:52:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, this doesn't seem hard
[20:52:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> State-owned company? Or private company that's not even registered in Russia?
[20:52:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems like an obvious choice
[20:52:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Especially since they're in the same field
[20:52:37] <gwern> strange to think that merely being a director on the board might make it 'untrustworthy'... like, what's a director going to do if the government says 'do x'
[20:52:52] <gwern> he shows up at a board meeting 4 times a year and nods his head at the pro forma votes
[20:53:53] <gwern> anyway, it was a strange decision from the perspective of optimizing AI progress, and right now probably both sberbank and yandex are being crippled by the intelligentsia diaspora. if there's anyone who can easily get hired elsewhere...
[20:54:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Besides, Yandex is way too multinational for Putin to feel confident about controlling them

In 2008, Yandex extended its presence in Ukraine by increasing bandwidth between Moscow data centers and UA-IX in Ukraine fivefold.[23] In 2009, all services of www.yandex.ua were localized for the
[20:54:44] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Ukrainian market.[24] In 2010, Yandex launched its "Poltava" search engine algorithm for Ukrainian users, based on its MatrixNet technology.[25]"
[20:55:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yandex is almost perfectly optimized for Putin to distrust them, really
[20:55:39] <gwern> that's all old, though. sberbank's AI stuff is all barely like 2 years old, not almost 20
[20:56:06] <gwern> I suppose there's a story where DL only progressed enough around 2018 to alarm them into standing up a reliable AI initiative
[20:56:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Of course, 2 years ago is when they acquired Rambler
[20:56:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And thereby presumably got the requisite talent)
[20:57:03] <gwern> rambler is itself ancient, so why 2020?
[20:57:07] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[20:57:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe they had non-publicly-visible in-house stuff, who knows?
[20:57:45] <gwern> yeah. I'm not saying it's inexplicable, but there definitely feels like a missing puzzle piece
[20:58:33] <gwern> someone in the Kremlin in 2019 suddenly getting religion on DL, or Yandex pulling some sort of 'traitorous' shit in 2018 convincing the kremlin it needs a local alternative, that sort of thing

[21:11:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's interesting, you know... it's very different from the emigration wave my family was part of. There it was like "welp, it is time to leave. and never come back. our old lives are gone and will not return and we will have to build up new lives from scratch, which will have nothing whatever to do with the lives we had until now"

[23:23:54] <Robomot> Himbo sapiens (@yashkaf): "if you hang out with rationalists you notice that they often don't get along with normies, but do get along splendidly with people who are into meditation and psychedelics, or even more woo things like chakras and enneagram etc. isn't this surprising?"
[23:26:10] <gwern> "at least they're thinking", I guess
[23:26:27] <gwern> badly, yes, but bad thought is still thought
[23:27:08] * PapuaHardyNet opens his mind
[23:29:52] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: your proposal, as outlined in the posted essay, is very ambitious, at least from my non-systems-programmer perspective
[23:32:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I did proofread it and found no syntactic errors. But I have no idea if there are any semantic errors or not
[23:33:13] <Obormot\Gaia> Oho! My LW books came in
[23:33:39] <gwern> I perused the physical copies briefly. they *are* pretty nice. too small, though, with too little inner margin so the text on the inside edge is bendy
[23:34:14] <Obormot\Gaia> Hmm. Softcover. Print quality leaves something to be desired but good for an amateur / vanity-press effort I guess.
[23:35:00] <Obormot\Gaia> Chapter / essay titles not printed at tops of pages... amateur-hour print design over here :/
[23:35:13] <Obormot\Gaia> Ah it's on the bottom?? Weird
[23:36:11] <Obormot\Gaia> My essay is in the "Incentives" book, eh

[23:39:45] <rmmh> gwern: no space for marginalia! 
[23:40:08] * gwern doesn't do marginalia so wouldn't notice that
[23:45:09] <feepbot> <gwern> 'First time I saw Scarface was on cable and they dubbed over the line with "pineapple". He's like "how am I gonna get a scar like this eatin pineapple, man?" And I'm like "those things are super sharp, I could totally see how that might happen."' https://twitter.com/ByYourLogic/status/1505363687720337409
[23:45:10] <Robomot> 30 year old man saying he is homesick (@ByYourLogic): "the line in Scarface where they ask Tony if he got his scar by eating pussy puzzled me for many years as a child. it was like one of those riddles that drives someone insane in a myth. like do women have a sharp thing in their pussy? eventually I just gave up"
[23:50:10] <feepbot> <gwern> https://thealtweb.com/entertainment/is-scott-adams-divorced/ you will be absolutely shocked to hear that scott adams's model wife, who in those videos looks like she despises him, is divorcing him after 2 years or so. hope you had a good prenup, scott

[23:53:08] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: thank you! can you say why you say it is very ambitious?
[23:54:04] <PapuaHardyNet> it seems like it would be a long term project that would require coordination and communication with different people in the linux community
[23:58:41] <kuudes> gwern, yes. also note that that ticket was really a connection flight to helsinki-frankfurt-nagoya, where when you checked just the frankfurt-nagoya part, that would have cost 2500 e
[23:59:14] <kuudes> plane tickets are not priced linearly, continuously, or in any way simple observably nice
[23:59:27] <gwern> oh. I forget what that's called but I remember people used to look for those so they could buy the extended version but actually just get off/on at the other stops
[23:59:38] <gwern> not sure if that's possible anymore
[23:59:53] <kuudes> iirc it has been sometimes benficial to first take a boat from helsinki to tallinn and then start a plane ticket with tallinn-helsinki in addition of the rest of the legs
[23:59:55] <gwern> (the airlines were pretty pleased with the extra control all the anti-terrorist ID-ticket regs gave them)
