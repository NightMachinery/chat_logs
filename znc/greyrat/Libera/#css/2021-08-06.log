[04:15:14] <entuland> moldorcoder7, you can simply set your main container with fixed position and zero inset - it will stick to the four corners of the viewport no matter what
[04:16:05] <entuland> can't tell if there is any facility in place in your libraries to do that - the above is the "pure css" approach, so to speak
[04:16:55] <moldorcoder7> by main container you mean a parent of header/content/footer right ?

[15:30:42] <hassoon> nullbytes: wht's the website
[15:40:02] <entuland> if you're setting up the metas properly and you're not using viewport units, then it should work
[15:42:48] <nullbytes> I don't have a link I can send you but the code is just: <body style='font-size: 15px'>The text is smaller in portrait</body>
[15:43:00] <nullbytes> I am not setting up metas is that the problem?

[16:02:21] <entuland> nullbytes, sure, that's a problem
[16:02:53] <entuland> if you don't set up the required metas the browser will assume you are not aware of mobile devices even existing

[16:14:20] <entuland> when you're using the mobile browser and you are selecting the desktop mode, you're telling it "ignore the meta viewport, show me the desktop version and try to adapt it the best way you can"

[16:15:29] <entuland> requesting the desktop version on mobile is pretty much just a necessary evil to account for screwed up websites that have been mutilated in their mobile version, or something
[16:15:59] <entuland> no, I don't know of any way, because that case falls into the user zoom scenario

[20:40:01] <entuland> actually, if all you want is that border, you can add it to the image directly, since it already overflows
[20:40:10] <entuland> you don't even need a wrapper for that
[20:41:18] <no_gravity> entuland: The content of the divs is user generated. It could be anything.
[20:41:39] <no_gravity> The table approach breaks on IOS.
[20:42:22] <entuland> what? you're rendering user provided HTML?

[20:43:25] <no_gravity> entuland: I am coding a tool for web developers. Not every website is an Instagram clone :)
[20:43:46] <entuland> you could as well constrain the elements inside of those containers only if they're not images (or anything else you don't want to constrain)

[21:08:25] <entuland> well, you may need to tweak it further
[21:08:37] <entuland> but at least that's a modern reliable approach that shouldn't break randomly
[21:08:58] <entuland> the last case you mentioned itn's a failure, it's just something that needs targeting with additional rules and maybe additional markup

[21:12:36] <Rockwood> no_gravity, hows your laravel learning?
[21:13:10] <no_gravity> Rockwood: Haven't dabbled with it for a long time. After Laravel I looked deeper into Symfony and then deeper into Django.
[21:13:28] <Rockwood> ok
[21:13:54] <no_gravity> Django is my favorite at the moment. But I saw that Flask is meanwhile more popular, so I might look into that one too.
[21:13:55] <Rockwood> i noticed you there that why i asked? thanks for nice reply
[21:14:16] <Rockwood> flask yes

[22:03:28] <no_gravity> So I finally tested the display:table approach on IOS and it works!
[22:05:28] <entuland> Rockwood, well, you can start by trying
[22:05:50] <entuland> but it depends on what you really mean with responsive
[22:05:55] <entuland> as it is a somewhat vague term
[22:06:01] <Rockwood> as per screen size
[22:06:22] <Rockwood> viewport size based
[22:06:23] <entuland> flex can help to an extent to avoid having to use media queries
[22:06:42] <Rockwood> i am using already flex
[22:06:54] <entuland> but if you already know that you want to change the layout substantially at certain breakpoints, by all means start adding media queries
[22:07:10] <entuland> I see, but flex is able to wrap
[22:07:20] <entuland> and that to an extent helps reducing the amount of media queries
[22:07:39] <Rockwood> okay
[22:07:43] <Rockwood> trying now
[22:11:48] <entuland> no media queries, check the behavior as you narrow the page down: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/yjatLndc/

[22:16:47] <entuland> Rockwood, yw, but you're screwing something up there
[22:17:05] <entuland> notice how dexterity goes somewhat more to the left if you have all the boxes in a single column
[22:17:47] <Rockwood> i set it
[22:17:54] <Rockwood> i am posting updated code
[22:18:11] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/gym.css entuland
[22:18:26] <entuland> no, the problem is still there
[22:19:16] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/sqCl4q6.png
[22:19:33] <entuland> you are messing with first / last child margins or something, don't do that once you start using flex
[22:20:03] *** Quits: Akimb (~Akimb@78-58-31-17.static.zebra.lt) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:20:13] <entuland> check the fiddle I shared earlier
[22:20:45] <entuland> you normally want padding and gap on the parent and only padding on the children, no margins on the flexed children
[22:21:04] <entuland> it's flex that should take care of such spacing via the gap, if anything
[22:23:04] <entuland> do this: give a 1px black border to those ULs you are flexing
[22:23:42] <entuland> then make sure that box is neatly aligned without odd spacing anywhere (as above, you should zero the margins and only use uniform padding + gap on the parent)
[22:23:47] <entuland> then remove the border
[22:26:05] <Rockwood> ok
[22:26:15] <Rockwood> sorry for delay in reply
[22:28:08] <Rockwood> entuland, https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/gym.css hope now fine

[22:30:12] <entuland> what do you see? can you see at a glance what that peach color and that green color mean?
[22:30:53] <entuland> or this - what can you tell at a glance looking at that overlay? https://i.imgur.com/6CfiI09.png

[22:42:48] <Rockwood> yes you are correct
[22:42:56] <Rockwood> i have to test em
[22:44:36] <entuland> if you refer to "em" as "1em" of the padding and gap I used, that's not the important bit
[22:44:41] <entuland> I could have used px instead
[22:45:07] <entuland> the point is whether or not to set padding, margin and gap, doesn't matter the unit for what I mean

[22:54:46] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[22:54:50] <entuland> give a uniform padding to the inner ULs
[22:54:57] <entuland> remove the margin from the inner ULs
[22:55:13] <entuland> give a uniform padding to the parent that is flexing those inner ULs
[22:55:20] <entuland> give a gap to the parent
[22:55:42] <entuland> by remove the margin I really mean set the margin to zero
[22:56:34] <entuland> convert the inner purple border to a 1px solid black border, just for the sake of seeing where the inner ULs boxes end
[22:58:49] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/gym.css
[22:59:27] <entuland> I don't see the gap nor the padding applied to the parent
[22:59:34] <entuland> I don't see the padding applied to the children
[23:00:37] <Rockwood> .mainBox ul {
[23:00:37] <Rockwood>   padding: 0px;
[23:00:44] <Rockwood> i have done this
[23:01:03] <Rockwood> parent means div here
[23:01:09] <entuland> okay, that's uniform padding, but that's zero padding, it's not going to help
[23:01:23] <Rockwood> then thne?
[23:01:34] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/DMqvSnr.png
[23:02:03] <entuland> doesn't that look somewhat more orderly?
[23:05:09] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/demo.js:256-316 done
[23:05:40] <entuland> is that okay with you without the gap?
[23:06:09] <entuland> if that's what you want, by all means keep it, with or without the inner borders
[23:06:28] <entuland> just realize what the various parts of the technique are
[23:08:21] <Rockwood> yes
[23:08:46] <Rockwood> now i understand the real concept
[23:08:57] <entuland> good
[23:08:59] <Rockwood> but why do you used flex-basis
[23:09:02] <Rockwood> ?
[23:09:21] <entuland> to give a desired minimum width to the children
[23:09:38] <entuland> otherwise they would get packed as much as possible
[23:09:44] <Rockwood> ah okay
[23:10:03] <Rockwood> lol

[23:24:12] <carlino3> hi
[23:24:39] <carlino3> is this legal CSS?  : `transform: translateX(-5px) translateX(-10px);`
[23:25:12] <carlino3> it works on FF and produces the desired effect (translates -15px on X axis) . will it work on all browsers consistently?
[23:26:05] <Rockwood> entuland, Result Comes Here top in div
[23:26:25] <Rockwood> i wanna do it on the top of the div
[23:26:48] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/demo.js:34-43
[23:27:54] <entuland> carlino3, open the mozilla documentation and check the page for translate()
[23:29:12] <carlino3> entuland i don't see any relevant to my question, what do you meant?
[23:29:29] <carlino3> anything*
[23:30:15] <entuland> the table about how the browsers support the feature isn't pertinent to your question about whether or not it will work on all browsers?
[23:30:55] <carlino3> no, look carefully. i'm talking about using multiple translate() functions at the same time
[23:31:03] <carlino3> i know the feature is well supported across browsers
[23:31:22] <entuland> then you should check the page for transform
[23:31:32] <entuland> and verify if the formal declaration allows multiple transforms
[23:32:08] <entuland> "One or more of the CSS transform functions to be applied. The transform functions are multiplied in order from left to right, meaning that composite transforms are effectively applied in order from right to left."
[23:32:13] <carlino3> it allows multiple transforms, like `transform: translate(-15px) rotate(15deg)`
[23:32:35] <carlino3> but it doesn't says anything about duplicated transform functions
[23:32:42] <entuland> because it doesn't matter
[23:32:49] <carlino3> like `transform: translateX(-5px) translateX(-5px)` resulting in -10px translation
[23:32:52] <entuland> if it did matter, it would have said that
[23:32:58] <entuland> read the part I quoted
[23:33:32] <entuland> key point there being "multiplied" and "applied in order"
