[00:03:57] <catniptwinz> @kuhilas Don't necessarily trust me on this bc I don't dual boot (and I'm here to ask about EFI as well lol), but I believe your EFI partition should be mounted at /boot, so at /mnt/boot while installing.
[00:05:13] <sklv> hi, i have this snippet in bashrc to startx on login taken from wiki: if [ -z "${DISPLAY}" ] && [ "${XDG_VTNR}" -eq 1 ]; then
[00:06:32] <sklv> it works, but when I log in, I get this error: -bash: [: : integer expression expected
[00:07:40] <NetSysFire> do you know what this snippet does?
[00:08:05] <kuhilas> catniptwinz: ouch thanks. I mounted it at /mnt/efi/ as was on the guide and the install script is currently running the pacstrap to install base system

[00:11:45] <catniptwinz> kuhilas: iirc what will happen is that the files that should be in your efi partition will be written to /mnt/boot, but that dir will be on your root volume instead bc you didn't mount your efi partition at /mnt/boot

[00:20:54] <NetSysFire> or just check if the var is empty first

[01:49:31] <GI_Jack> then kick it back to AUR, so I can support it in my own repo without having to conflict with official arch namespace
[01:49:38] <kevr> Then the package should be moved off to the aur instead of being in the official repositories.
[01:50:09] <NetSysFire> you are free to use your own package and build it yourself, keep in mind that all arch staff are volunteers
[01:50:27] <NetSysFire> who knows, maybe they couldnt update it because their family member got ill?
[01:50:28] <kevr> that's always the answer.
[01:50:41] <NetSysFire> yeah its just that i find behavior like this pretty disgusting and abrasive
[01:50:53] <NetSysFire> pay them and *then* you can expect them to do stuff for you
[01:50:57] <GI_Jack> NetSysFire, that sounds great except it was closed with a wontfix
[01:51:05] <kevr> NetSysFire: the person who updated Flask 2 should have brought this up about all packages that it affected in the repositories.
[01:51:18] <kevr> Depending on other devs to just randomly fix it after a bug is filed is a terrible approach.
[01:51:27] <GI_Jack> so no, the answer wasn't "we haven't got around to it yet, which would have been understandable", the answer was litterally "not our problem"
[01:51:56] <GI_Jack> I only said something AFTER it was closed with a wont fix

[01:52:59] <kevr> It is not actually hard to search for packages that depend on a package. That should be done with every testing step; ensure ALL dependent packages are A. Doing the right thing and B. Not gonna break.
[01:53:00] <GI_Jack> and even after that, if you just scroll up, package maintainer just told me 15 minuetes ago, because its upstream, he won't fix it, even if its sitting broken in the official repositories. So no, it wasn't a sick family member, not getting around to it, it was litterally closed with a wontfix
[01:53:06] <kevr> imo.
[01:54:23] <kevr> That's basically the same answer I got when it came to avr-binutils, but the issue wasn't actually upstream, the issue was with the person who pushed avr-binutils to the repositories doing something that should not have been done
[01:54:54] <kevr> regardless, a dependent update broke it because of that.
[01:55:04] <GI_Jack> I know exactly what happened
[01:56:09] <GI_Jack> the real problem isn't that it broke, that happens, or even forgot testing it, again, we all make mistakes, its that he's just going to leave a broken package in production, and close the ticket with a wontfix
[01:56:23] <kevr> ^
[01:56:24] <GI_Jack> could have left it open, got around to it tommorrow, asked for help
[01:56:27] <kevr> indeed.
[01:56:50] <GI_Jack> asked me for help, I maintain packages in AUR and would have been more than happy to, wouldn't think twice, but that isn't what happened
[01:56:56] <Edu4rdSHL> And you're just cryting here without proposing a solution.
[01:57:02] <Edu4rdSHL> crying*
[01:57:03] <GI_Jack> two possible solutions
[01:57:10] <kevr> i already proposed a solution to avoiding it
[01:57:13] <GI_Jack> one, use PKGBUILD I posted https://0bin.net/paste/8vP25nPB#LZtYQzwWxMKflMbVjDGoNKyK31UcGtxxVcylAD1PX76
[01:57:14] <EMIYA> repasted ⇒ https://0x0.st/-VWP.txt
[01:57:14] <phrik> Title: 0bin - encrypted pastebin (at 0bin.net)
[01:57:16] <kevr> but it won't avoid everything
[01:57:24] <kevr> it'll help a lot, though, with basic stuff that shouldn't happen
[01:57:31] <GI_Jack> and then import python-flask1 I JUST WROTE BECAUSE OF THIS
[01:57:46] <GI_Jack> because even after that, patches welcome, so I did in fact write a fix, have one ready to go
[01:57:56] <GI_Jack> either that, or just kick the package to AUR so I can maintain it there
[01:58:01] <GI_Jack> bam, two solutions

[02:57:51] <andrew> to be fair polkit is the only escalator I know of, the thing is I'm not used to use this stuff, I use sudo & su, pretty sure polkit is better for GUIs since it can do the task it needs then drop the privilege
[02:58:08] <GI_Jack> alad, it does, but all the comparable solutions do, and compared to sudo, gksu, etc... polkit has the best least access solution
[02:58:21] <Repentinus> polkit is pretty neat in the console too

[02:58:32] <bin> Namarrgon: it doesn't happen with an external keyboard and right now it's not happening, and it's not happening right now so it's hard to say if it happens in the TTY, but I believe it did the other day

[02:58:55] <alad> polkit
[02:58:59] <andrew> but I just question the security of sudo and polkit; su is the simplest one that makes sense (for me) as it asks for root's password

[02:59:59] <bin> ooh i misread
[03:00:01] <baltazar> andrew: asking for the user's passowrd has advantages for multi-user systems, since that way you can revoke access from a single user without having to change the root password
[03:00:04] <bin> i thoguht you meannt configuration files
[03:00:06] <Namarrgon> test an external keyboard, inside X and on the linux console
[03:00:29] <bin> i did test external keyboard and other than the weirdness of not being able to find the screen the keys worked normally 
[03:00:43] <bin> ill try doing irc in the tty and seeing if i cant trigger it
[03:00:56] <Repentinus> Aye, on any system with multiple users you want logs to identify which user authenticated when and what they ran as root.
[03:01:19] <oatmealraisin> alad: is there somewhere i can read about all this, or something i can search for? this is pretty interesting
[03:01:23] <bin> oof the brightness in the tty is powerful lmao
[03:01:25] <GI_Jack> the feature I want is a second sudo-password for root, so each user gets a second password, and login passwords are not used for root
[03:01:35] <GI_Jack> either that or yubikeys for sudo/polkit
[03:01:46] <GI_Jack> or 2FA with password/yubiley
[03:01:47] <GI_Jack> key

[16:40:40] <wyre> (you suggested me to move to lts temporarily) 
[16:41:25] <jonathon> there was a recent `linux-firmware` update - might be worth checking with the older version?

[16:42:38] <wyre> NetSysFire, I'd say so, like a month ago I wasn't having these problems
[16:42:39] <chazy> jonathon: can't say for sure, i was checking card0 before the update which is the intel igpu, after the update i checked the other cards and they have the files, looks like the issue is for navi, maybe polaris is not affected, i'll have to check later when i have a moment

[20:05:20] <chazy> jkc: it's not really paranoia, i've been wanting to learn how to do FDE for a while now

[20:06:43] <chazy> really? how do i boot if the bootloader is encrypted?
[20:06:50] <jkc> It doesn't need to be.
[20:07:02] <jkc> Why would the bootloader need to be encrypted?

[20:07:12] *** Joins: emika (~emika@83.136.182.55)
[20:07:19] <jkc> Same question. Why would the bootloader need to be encrypted?
[20:07:33] <chazy> i didn't say it needs to be
[20:07:48] <jkc> Then stop worrying about that?
[20:07:50] <chazy> but it has to be on a different drive
[20:08:18] <jkc> That's why FDE generally isn't actually FDE.
[20:08:18] <chazy> i want to boot my encrypted arch install, but i need to properly configure grub first
[20:08:51] <jkc> And why virtually no one in the security industry - like me - considers that part of the definition of FDE.
[20:09:05] *** Quits: TrueTechie (~weechat@user/truetechie) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[20:09:06] <chazy> the wiki doesn't exactly explain how to set the kernel parameters for grub, it just says "if using GRUB, the relevant parameters are added to /etc/default/grub before generating the main configuration file."
[20:09:09] <jkc> So you might consider NOT overcomplicating this. The bootloader doesn't need to be encrypted; stop trying to force it.
[20:09:20] <chazy> i'm not trying to encrypt the bootloader
[20:09:36] <chazy> i've only encrypted the ssd where the arch is installed
[20:09:38] <baltazar> chazy: "full disk encryption" is a stupid term, you should rather think about as "encrypted root". just have your bootloader be a normal, unencrypted partition on the same drive as your encrypted root partition
[20:09:40] <jkc> You're following a definition of FDE that doesn't exist. So reduce the complexity of what you're doing.
[20:10:43] <jkc> Hell, I think you can have your kernel/initramfs on a LUKS1 /boot partition, so that all UEFI does is provide grub.
[20:10:52] *** Joins: tradar (~tradar@user/tradar)
[20:11:00] <chazy> i don't think it's relevant for grub wether it's in the same drive as root or not
[20:11:28] <chazy> what i don't know is where do i put the dm-crypt kernel parameters
[20:12:06] <jkc> chazy: Stop doing what you're doing. Stop trying to use external drives. Just do a normal LUKS full system encryption setup.
[20:12:42] <chazy> even if i start from scratch to do that, i still wouldn't know where to put the dm-crypt kernel params
[20:12:50] <jkc> The Arch wiki is quite specific on that.
[20:13:41] <jkc> Wherever "kernel parameters" go. To learn that, the GRUB article covers that.
[20:14:02] <chazy> yeah, it says add them to /etc/default/grub

[20:39:46] <ayustae> You can also try "lvscan", this should return a list of all lvs with some other information

[20:40:31] <tlgs> tangentially related, I installed Arch a couple of months ago and looked for the simplest configuration possible for the filesystem (i.e. ext4). I think I'm now comfortable enough to go for a "better" setup using BTRFS and disk encryption.
[20:40:39] <tlgs> As far as I understand this involves nuking my current system and install from scratch, is that correct? Any specific tips besides backing up all of my data/configs?
