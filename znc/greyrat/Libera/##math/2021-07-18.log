[01:05:51] <buster> here's a very belaboured version of an answer, no doubt still full of typos, but emphasizing the transposition as a feature not a bug: https://ibb.co/9sj6zBK
[01:06:03] <buster> may it be even less fun to read than it was to write :)
[01:06:36] <johnkeats6> buster, well, if you have a basis e_1, ..., e_n you can think of the 'coordinates' x_1, ..., x_n as really the dual basis, so that's where the transposing is coming from
[01:06:47] <buster> oh man. i know! :D
[01:07:35] <kenthurley> int-e: thank you for example, although I knew about it. For clarity, I'm on purpose asking about "completely unisomorphic". That is, something like for any bijection f between groups we would have f(xy)=f(x)f(y) for nothing except x=e or y=e. Well, that is not fully formal, but something like that
[01:07:47] <buster> (C^3)^* !! :)
[01:08:10] <johnkeats6> hopefully you won't be offended if i don't read it :p

I've a list of trekking routes and for each one I have many x,y,z points (lat,lon,elevation) to draw them on map (they come from openstreetmap and are publicly available). I already have the total length, the elevation profile, the accumulated ascent and accumulated descent, but what I need to calculate is what is the best *partial* track for persons that have difficulties in handling climbs
[04:38:46] <arkanoid> and descents, so basically I'm looking for long partial tracks with low accumulated ascent and descent

[06:07:58] <dude12312414> well this should be an easy consequence of the epsilon-delta definition though
[06:08:02] <Nickssen> hi powerful frelleck
[06:08:10] * frelleck fires a lightning bolt
[06:08:29] <Nickssen> the problem is just a multivariable lipschitz boi but he wants us to prove that that implies continuity

[06:08:38] <Nickssen> the boi
[06:08:43] <dude12312414> like, unrolling the definition for |a_n| -> 0 will turn up the same as the one for a_n -> 0

[06:11:10] <Nickssen> https://imgur.com/a/4452uPo       this is the kind of proof he wants, (the part it says "prop")
[06:11:14] <frelleck> it's something of the form: as y -- > x,  you have y - x --> 0, so ||y - x|| --> 0, so ||y - x||^(alpha) --> 0, so ||f(y) - f(x)|| ---> 0, so f(y) ---> f(x).
[06:11:21] <frelleck> but how you do that depends what you're given
[06:11:38] <frelleck> you could just do deltas and epsilons like dude12312414 suggested
[06:11:39] <Nickssen> i found this "reverse" triangle inequality
[06:11:46] <Nickssen> i think i could use that
[06:11:58] <frelleck> that gives that ||x|| is continuous
[06:12:01] <Nickssen> those always destroy me hehe
[06:12:12] <Nickssen> I have developed allergies to e-d limits
[06:12:45] <frelleck> if you start with ||y - x|| < delta you should end out with ||f(y) - f(x)|| < K delta^(alpha)
[06:12:58] <frelleck> see if you can prove that and then turn it into a delta epsilon
[06:13:55] <Nickssen> will do
[06:14:05] <Nickssen> gonna see if i can convince you with reverse triangle f
[06:15:23] <Nickssen> https://imgur.com/a/w71SMBp
[06:15:30] <Nickssen> does this  make sense to you?
[06:19:13] <frelleck> you don't really need the last part
[06:19:30] <frelleck> with the reverse triangle inequality
[06:19:40] <frelleck> and before that you are assuming the limit exists, but you don't know that
[06:20:15] <Nickssen> but if K and alpha are positive and
[06:20:31] <Nickssen> K||x-y||^alpha goes to 0
[06:20:41] <Nickssen> so by squeeze theorem the middle should too right?
[06:21:04] <Nickssen> or not necesarilly?
[06:21:04] <frelleck> you should add that statement
[06:21:13] <frelleck> just saying it needs to be justified
[06:21:57] <frelleck> so first say 0 <= ||f(x) - f(y)|| <= K||x - y||^(alpha)
[06:22:04] <frelleck> then use the squeeze theorem to justify
[06:22:24] <frelleck> (if you're allowed that)

[06:24:20] <Nickssen> so then with that I conclude lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0
[06:24:26] <frelleck> yeah
[06:24:28] <Nickssen> but i still need to prove continuity
[06:25:00] <Nickssen> so i need to take the argument of that norm apart to form the lim x->y   f(x) = f(y)
[06:25:05] <frelleck> that's the definition of continuity
[06:25:08] <frelleck> (almost)
[06:25:27] <frelleck> you should have a statement that lim || f(x) - f(y) || = 0 is equivalent to f(x) --> f(y)
[06:25:52] <Nickssen> thats where I thought the triangle boi could be used
[06:26:11] <Nickssen> to me it seems to do it but im a noob so i go to the powerful frelleck
[06:26:18] <frelleck> nah the norms converging isn't enough
[06:26:51] <frelleck> you could have (1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (1,-1),...
[06:27:43] <Nickssen> hmph
[06:28:07] <frelleck> it's just that lim ||a_n|| = 0 implies lim a_n = 0 basically
[06:28:23] <Nickssen> ahh
[06:28:26] <frelleck> applied to ||f(x_n) - f(y)|| for any x_n converging to y
[06:28:31] <frelleck> you have to have it in some form somehow
[06:30:43] <Nickssen> how do you remember all this

[11:37:23] <tusko> say we have a DE given by M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0 that is exact. Does the solution we find \Phi(x,y) = ... = C give the level curves for any choice of C that is defined?
[11:37:49] <tusko> Or is this what the explicit solution y(t) gives or what?
[11:39:13] <PlanckWalk> phi(x,y) = C does give level curves for phi, which corresponds to possible trajectories for (x,y)
[11:40:27] <PlanckWalk> Particular solutions may only trace out subsets of those level curves, though.
[11:42:47] <tusko> Ok, that's what I was thinking. Once we solve for the particular solution, by plugging y and x values into phi(x,y) we effectively collapse ourselves down to one trajectory on that surface?
[11:43:16] <PlanckWalk> Yes, the initial values will (usually) yield a particular solution.

[14:01:32] <riv> so you have H <= G, and want to know ker pi|_H
[14:02:07] <riv> i imagine we should split this into two, maybe 3 cases. N <= H, H <= N and neither maybe
[14:02:21] <riv> at least to start working on the problem
[14:02:56] <cadmio> let H an arbitrary subgroup of G

[16:15:13] <Z-module> rendar, for most specific numeric s you give, it won't have a radicals-closed-form solution.

[16:20:40] <Z-module> rendar: those way equal-signs after each y there means "approximately". Sure, it's approximate numeric solutions; a trivial matter.
[16:21:03] <Z-module> (well, straightforward anyhow)

[16:21:29] <Fangs> there's no best method. if you need to do this practically I'd import some numerical math library and use w/e is available

[20:32:14] <qedders> you can read it in a walk through combinatorics, I like that book
