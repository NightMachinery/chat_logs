[02:34:09] <FunkyBob> any details?
[02:34:25] <wallbroken> hello FunkyBob
[02:34:29] <wallbroken> well, it's a tricky problem
[02:34:50] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/tE6x#L13
[02:34:59] <wallbroken> here you have the function on the view
[02:35:10] <wallbroken> ops, the method inside of the generic class view
[02:35:12] <wallbroken> and the form
[02:35:13] *** Quits: argento (~argent0@168-227-96-53.ptr.westnet.com.ar) (Quit: leaving)
[02:35:38] <wallbroken> the problem is that for unchecked fields, it sends an empty forms which overwrites the terminated_items fields
[02:36:02] <wallbroken> many people here today tried helping it on that
[02:36:06] <wallbroken> but they all failed
[02:36:11] <FunkyBob> so you're still using the bullshit broken schema... still using formsets... still using class-based views...
[02:36:24] <FunkyBob> what would convince me that any advice I give would be heeded?
[02:36:56] *** Quits: flying_sausages (~flying_sa@user/flying-sausages/x-2113186) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:43:40] <FunkyBob> if you don't want the form to edit terminated-user, don't tell it to edit terminated-user
[02:44:06] <FunkyBob> which, iirc, is the reverse accessor for terminated-items
[02:47:47] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: the problem is more complicate then it seems
[02:49:03] *** Joins: HoaxKey (~HoaxKey@host-89-241-52-74.as13285.net)
[02:49:30] <wallbroken> let's suppose we have 5 items in the orders page
[02:49:54] <wallbroken> item 1, item 2, has the terminated_items set
[02:50:06] *** Joins: flying_sausages (~flying_sa@user/flying-sausages/x-2113186)
[02:50:14] <wallbroken> item 3, item 4, item 5, hase terminated_items not set
[02:50:34] <wallbroken> now i'll set the checkbox for items 2 and item 3 and submit the form
[02:50:54] <wallbroken> what i'll get is item 1, item 4, item 5 with terminated_items not set
[02:51:17] <wallbroken> and item 2 and item 3 with terminated_items with current user set
[02:51:21] <wallbroken> that's wrong
[02:51:34] <wallbroken> because i wanted to change only item 2 and 3
[02:51:39] <wallbroken> and not the other
[02:51:54] <wallbroken> this is because the submit button sends an empty form for the unchecked ones
[02:51:59] <wallbroken> is there a way to avoid this?
[02:52:00] <wallbroken> thanks

[02:55:00] <wallbroken> somebody here proposed me a solution
[02:55:01] <wallbroken> del form.cleaned_data['terminated']
[02:55:04] <FunkyBob> well, you've defaulted terminated to True in your code...
[02:55:07] <FunkyBob> so that's not helping
[02:55:15] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i also tried with false
[02:55:18] <wallbroken> but same result
[02:55:32] <FunkyBob> where's the related template?
[02:56:25] <FunkyBob> you say it's submitting "empty forms" ... how did you determine that?
[02:58:22] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/oRKR#L153
[02:58:49] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i did some tests, and it happens only for unchecked items
[03:00:17] <FunkyBob> "some tests"...
[03:02:47] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i have not the evidence that it sends an empty form
[03:03:22] <wallbroken> what do you think the problem is?
[03:06:02] <FunkyBob> so... you've no evidence of empty forms, you're just making that up
[03:06:18] <FunkyBob> assumptions are the enemy of debugging
[03:09:05] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i could know with a print() ?

[03:40:57] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i think this: self.request.user
[03:41:13] <PaulWay[w]> Nope.
[03:41:15] <FunkyBob> you think a property called 'user' will containe the POSTed data?
[03:41:16] <wallbroken> without user
[03:41:20] <FunkyBob> how do you figure that?
[03:41:24] <wallbroken> self.requet.form

[03:42:04] <PaulWay[w]> Try to reason it out.
[03:42:17] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i have to db one with the news and one with the data i try add, when have news + the data
[03:42:23] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i just take a guess
[03:42:35] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: we know. don't
[03:42:38] <wallbroken> maybe just self.rrequest ?

[03:42:50] <FunkyBob> Do you even science?
[03:43:06] <PaulWay[w]> Continuing to guess when we've told you not to is very rude.
[03:43:07] <FunkyBob> here's a hint
[03:43:12] <FunkyBob> another hint, actually
[03:43:14] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i try this but its look me stupid way :x https://dpaste.org/VzHd
[03:43:35] <FunkyBob> when you ask a Form class to verify the POSTed data... what do you pass  it?
[03:44:05] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: why is it news.0 ?  will you need to access the other news objects later?

[03:45:11] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob yes it ah table i can make its in loop maybe but i dont know how to add to each symbol the data from the other db

[03:46:45] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob https://dpaste.org/VzHd#L you see the news db ? i want get from the other db the data on this name
[03:46:49] <rannnn8888> symbol
[03:47:13] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: you need to explain a lot more about the data you have and what you're trying to do with it.

[03:48:40] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, but how?
[03:48:50] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: so you don't answer my questions but you expect me to answer yours?
[03:48:52] <wallbroken> i opened network tab
[03:49:04] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you need to stop assuming we can see your computer, and read your mind
[03:49:15] <FunkyBob> because so much of what you do makes it look like you think that
[03:49:17] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: in fact i answered
[03:49:39] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: sure, but you suddenly switched from working out how to print() the posted data... to looking in the browser
[03:49:44] <FunkyBob> AND DIDN'T TELL US ANYTHING
[03:49:48] <FunkyBob> yes, you got the data
[03:50:16] <FunkyBob> we _almost_ had you figure something out... and you just gave up
[03:50:20] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: if you don't answer our questions, why should we answer yours?
[03:50:20] <FunkyBob> you came so close to learning.
[03:50:33] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: my idea is to tell the view: if the form isn't passed, ignore parsing on the field for that form id
[03:50:39] <wallbroken> is possible to do something like that?
[03:50:41] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: if you don't answer our questions, why should we answer yours?
[03:50:46] <FunkyBob> the form was passed, as you can see
[03:50:59] <wallbroken> PaulWay[w]: i answered
[03:51:15] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you still haven't shown us the template

[03:56:29] <PaulWay[w]> And that's why I'm asking.

[03:56:55] <Steve-Dusty> Quacc yeah, this guy have history here
[03:57:44] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: have you seen that only part of that code is involved because there is "if not user.is_staff" ?

[03:58:54] <wallbroken> it's quite clear what the issue is?
[03:59:05] <wallbroken> i'm afraid i didn't explained it quite well
[03:59:32] <FunkyBob> the issue seems to be you've included a field in the form... that you don't want the form to update.
[03:59:45] <FunkyBob> and are now annoyed that... it's doing exactly what you told it, and updating that field
[04:01:14] <PaulWay[w]> In other words, wallbroken - you should have been able to figure this out for yourself.
[04:01:14] <rannnn8888> not have way get spcipic row in the tamplate It does not make sense ?
[04:01:35] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: You're not making sense.

[04:02:30] <wallbroken> for the other ones, it ereases the previous field state

[04:08:32] <rannnn8888> It is impossible to explain this only through the image
[04:08:38] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.
[04:09:02] <PaulWay[w]> So you pasting a link to an image is ... not helpful.
[04:09:16] <rannnn8888> again i have one DB add news all the day So far this is understandable: c ?
[04:09:34] *** Quits: koo6 (~koo6@89-24-13-235.customers.tmcz.cz) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[04:09:37] <PaulWay[w]> No.
[04:09:49] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: my guess is: for the checked items is sending the terminated state: on
[04:09:59] <wallbroken> the view get that form value and processes it
[04:10:03] <wallbroken> if that form state is not
[04:10:12] <wallbroken> the form is empty
[04:10:27] <wallbroken> so form.save() resets the managed form fields
[04:10:27] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: do you have two databases, or two models?
[04:10:36] <rannnn8888> PaulWay[w] What no ? DATABASE SQLITE
[04:10:45] <rannnn8888> https://dpaste.org/7XbL
[04:10:58] <rannnn8888> this the first with the news its So far this is understandable: c ?
[04:11:17] <PaulWay[w]> That's one model, yes.
[04:11:19] <wallbroken> so, my quesiton is: is there a way to tell the form.save(). don't considered the items which has not terminated state passed?
[04:11:24] <PaulWay[w]> That's not a database.
[04:12:35] <rannnn8888> and i have one more db !!!! with the deltils on the alll symbol i can get in the news https://dpaste.org/5QXY
[04:12:45] <rannnn8888> itss understandable: c ?
[04:13:06] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: those are two models, in one database.
[04:13:18] <PaulWay[w]> Please do not use 'db' or 'database' when you mean 'model.
[04:13:45] <rannnn8888> PaulWay[w] but i  use two db why u tell me no ?
[04:14:08] <PaulWay[w]> Then share your settings.py file.
[04:14:14] <rannnn8888> https://dpaste.org/h0Fy
[04:14:50] <PaulWay[w]> Just call them models.  We do not care whether they're in two databases.
[04:15:28] <rannnn8888> ok now when i have new news i want add in the table data from the other models
[04:15:43] <rannnn8888> https://dpaste.org/qVKO stupid example
[04:17:05] <rannnn8888> PaulWay[w] now itss understandable maybe :D ?
[04:20:18] <Steve-Dusty> is Itachi Uchiha good
[04:20:33] <Steve-Dusty> nvm
[04:21:13] <Steve-Dusty> has anyone used Django Crispy Forms for bootstrap 5?
[04:21:16] <Steve-Dusty> it looks kinda sh*tty
[04:21:29] <Steve-Dusty> https://ibb.co/gwcYb7M
[04:21:29] <Steve-Dusty> look
[04:21:41] <Steve-Dusty> https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/crispy-bootstrap5
[04:21:46] <Steve-Dusty> does it look this shit for you too?
[04:22:41] <FunkyBob> ugh
[04:22:46] <FunkyBob> crispy forms :/
[04:23:24] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: firstly, django lets you supply your own templates for widget rendering
[04:25:54] <Steve-Dusty>  :/
[04:26:08] <Steve-Dusty> udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/ is this bad
[04:27:50] <rannnn8888> i can make its like this but its take very lng time https://dpaste.org/FMaJ
[04:27:50] <FunkyBob> no idea
[04:28:09] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: it's teaching jquery... so... it's not great
[04:28:36] *** Joins: dre (~dre@2001:8003:c932:c301:482c:1f78:f040:9036)
[04:28:37] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[04:28:40] <Steve-Dusty> why jQuery bad?
[04:28:44] <Steve-Dusty> dollar sign functions ew?
[04:29:20] <Steve-Dusty> :vomit:
[04:34:46] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: by having those two models in different tables you have made it much harder for yourself.
[04:35:20] <PaulWay[w]> Your 'newsstable.symbol' cannot be related to 'stempneww.Symbol'.
[04:35:37] <PaulWay[w]> Who's idea was it to put those two models in different databases?
[04:35:39] <rannnn8888> PaulWay[w] i dont have a choice here dont have a way by the modles make this ? https://dpaste.org/50Bz
[04:36:04] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: have you an idea on how to solve the problem?
[04:36:37] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, and I've told you several times
[04:36:45] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: yes, but you can't do more complicated queries on them.
[04:36:53] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: jquery has its place, and was really useful... about 10 years ago
[04:37:04] <Steve-Dusty> why it bad now?
[04:37:07] <PaulWay[w]> And your database engine can't optimise the query.
[04:37:10] <FunkyBob> when browsers were wildly inconsistent and incompatibly, not to mention buggy (*cough* IE *cough*)
[04:37:28] <FunkyBob> but since then browsers have improved, compliance is high, and the DOM and JS APIs have vastly improved
[04:37:42] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: so who's idea was it to put those two models in different databases?
[04:37:48] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[04:38:02] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: is not possible to tell the form to not save the elements which haven't the "terminated: on" field passed?
[04:38:57] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: also, your use of text fields will cause you a lot more problems in the future.
[04:39:46] <FunkyBob> in fact, rather tellingly
[04:39:55] <FunkyBob> one of the selling points of bootstrap 5 is that it no longer depends on jquery
[04:39:58] <PaulWay[w]> Steve-Dusty: AIUI there are also better libraries than JQuery out there now.
[04:40:13] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: of course it's possible
[04:40:23] <PaulWay[w]> I haven't used them because my own websites are stuck in 1998 for sentimental reasons.
[04:40:31] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: imho the majority of what jquery provided is no longer needed...
[04:40:43] <PaulWay[w]> FunkyBob: Yes.
[04:41:20] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: can you please explain to me why this isn't working? https://dpaste.org/uMtA#L7
[04:41:22] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: i don't believe you'll listen to me anyway... you've ignored most of what I've said today, so why would I expect that to change?
[04:41:26] <PaulWay[w]> Crimson Christ, the number of people who ignore questions around here.
[04:41:49] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: well, i haven't ignored what you told me today
[04:41:50] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: would it help if we told you that the reason it's not working is because you're doing it wrong?
[04:42:08] <Steve-Dusty> well, wallbroken, you shouldn't ignore anything he says
[04:42:31] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes you have... repeatedly
[04:42:36] <wallbroken> you told me "build it all again from tha scratch" that's the sense of your statement
[04:42:57] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, well, that's to be expected when you start a proof-of-concept
[04:43:07] <FunkyBob> oh, but you lied about that, didn't you?
[04:43:14] <wallbroken> because the template is malformed, the view has generic view you think it's too much hard to me to understand
[04:43:15] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: but I'm not even talking about that bitr
[04:43:30] <FunkyBob> still not what I'm talking about
[04:43:36] <FunkyBob> and so  y ou're really making my point for me
[04:43:52] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: someting i want to try to reasoning on problems
[04:44:08] <wallbroken> this is a way to understand for me
[04:44:18] <wallbroken> so, after a lot of debugging i understood the problem
[04:44:23] <wallbroken> i tried applying a fix
[04:44:32] <wallbroken> but i don't know why that fix isn't working
[04:44:39] <wallbroken> and i'm asking you for help about that
[04:44:52] <FunkyBob> but you don't
[04:44:54] <FunkyBob> you don't rteason
[04:45:05] <Steve-Dusty> stebdadeb
[04:45:05] <FunkyBob> when asked to explain your reasons... you don't
[04:45:06] <wallbroken> yes, i figured it out where the problem is
[04:45:20] <FunkyBob> you make up shit... instead of using basic logic and reasoning
[04:45:22] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: have you seen what my view toes?
[04:45:30] <wallbroken> it gets the "terminated" value from the form
[04:45:34] <wallbroken> it puts it in "term" variable
[04:45:41] <wallbroken> the it uses it in an "if" statement
[04:45:45] <wallbroken> if the if returns true
[04:45:57] <wallbroken> it does this: self.request.user.terminated_items.add(obj)
[04:46:00] <FunkyBob> and updates the object either way....
[04:46:06] <wallbroken> which it means that is adding the object to the m2m fields
[04:46:16] <wallbroken> and at this point all is working fine
[04:46:20] <wallbroken> as expected
[04:46:20] <FunkyBob> erasing the values in the field you say you don't want it to... because you told it to edit that field
[04:46:33] <FunkyBob> and I said very early on... that this is what was happening
[04:46:40] <wallbroken> yes
[04:46:40] <FunkyBob> and you've ignored that from the start
[04:47:08] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: please, something try to follow my reasoning
[04:47:16] <FunkyBob> you told the form to edit that field.. and now you complain that it edits that field.
[04:47:25] <wallbroken> tell the form to ignore unchanged fields could be done?
[04:47:37] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i think its the start how i can make this but how i can limit the data i want in the tample https://dpaste.org/vBmQ
[04:47:43] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i know it, and i'm trying a way to avoid that
[04:47:59] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: then the simple solution is don't list that field to be ecited
[04:48:00] <rannnn8888> https://dpaste.org/ZYzu example
[04:48:01] <FunkyBob> edited
[04:48:01] <wallbroken> please, could you tell me why "del form.cleaned_data['terminated']" isn't doing that?
[04:48:15] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: 'terminated' is not a field on  your model
[04:48:22] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: your template isn't the problem
[04:48:22] <wallbroken> yes it is
[04:48:25] <FunkyBob> so why would removing it from the cleaned data make any difference to updating the form?
[04:48:26] <wallbroken> oh wait
[04:48:28] <wallbroken> no it's not
[04:48:43] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: what's the view code that's generating that response?
[04:49:00] <wallbroken> 2:18:03 AM - FunkyBob: wallbroken: then the simple solution is don't list that field to be ecited
[04:49:06] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: the code you have handling terminated... looks ok to me
[04:49:07] <wallbroken> but i need to edit it when the checkbox is on
[04:49:19] <FunkyBob> edit what?
[04:49:52] <FunkyBob> do you want that form to update the terminated_user m2m field?
[04:49:55] <wallbroken> "terminated" field needs to be passed from the form
[04:50:08] <wallbroken> yes, but trough a checkbox
[04:50:10] <wallbroken> not directly
[04:50:24] <FunkyBob> so "no"
[04:50:32] <rannnn8888> PaulWay[w] Now its this but if i can slove this by the way i write in the modle i dont need the stck https://dpaste.org/vAPY
[04:50:34] *** Joins: HoaxKey (~HoaxKey@host-89-241-52-74.as13285.net)
[04:50:40] <FunkyBob> so don't list it in the fields for the Form to edit....
[04:50:52] <FunkyBob> this is what I told you earlier that you've studiously ignored the whole time
[04:51:08] <FunkyBob> you _don't_ want the Form to update that field, you want YOUR CODE to do it
[04:51:22] <wallbroken> ooooooooh
[04:51:23] <PaulWay[w]> Ah, another generic class view user.
[04:51:27] <wallbroken> your solution is working
[04:51:30] <wallbroken> thank you!!!!
[04:51:48] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: so once again... this could have been resolved if you hadn't ignored half of what I said
[04:52:14] <wallbroken> i need to think by myself, i cannot do something like a robot
[04:52:24] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: the fact that your two models are completely separate and not related on the 'symbol' field means this will never work well for you.
[04:52:27] <wallbroken> i tried figuring out where the problem was
[04:52:46] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, well, we tried to help you, guide your thinking... but you ignored us
[04:52:53] <PaulWay[w]> wow.  It's working so now you come back with accusations?
[04:53:00] <PaulWay[w]> That's pretty rude.
[04:53:03] <wallbroken> well, could you tell me the specific statement i ignored?
[04:53:30] <wallbroken> just to know if i truly ignored it or i misunderstood it
[04:53:56] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yeah, every time I mentioned that you were annoyed the Form was updating the field y ou told it to update
[04:54:36] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: and so, once again, I ask: who was it that decided that those two models should be in separate databases?

[04:55:35] <FunkyBob> 22:46 < FunkyBob> the issue seems to be you've included a field in the form... that you don't want the form to update.

[04:56:09] <wallbroken> yeah, I didn't get the sense of that statement soon

[05:04:10] <Quacc> im saying that you should not help the people who refuse to be helped
[05:04:16] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: so I will not answer you until you answer that question.
[05:04:40] <PaulWay[w]> Quacc: and it is indeed because they keep asking for helpo that we do not refuse them.
[05:04:56] <rannnn8888> PaulWay[w] You ask unrelated questions. If I could do everything in one DB I would do no?
[05:04:57] <PaulWay[w]> If they said "I don't want to be helped, I'm going to do this on my own" this would cause us great joy.
[05:05:10] <PaulWay[w]> rannnn8888: Yes, you can do everything in one database.
[05:05:23] <PaulWay[w]> And my question is entirely relevant.
[05:05:42] <PaulWay[w]> The fact that you think you need two databases is exactly why you're failing.
[05:06:06] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: you get <QuerySet ...  because, just like you saw in the tutorial, that's what happens when you str() a queryset

[05:13:55] <rannnn8888> PaulWay[w] Because you ask questions that I can not change, there is an existing situation and I have to deal with it, if I could do both in the same DB, I would not ask the questions here now.
[05:14:08] <PaulWay[w]> You can do both in the same database.
[05:14:24] <PaulWay[w]> Why do you think you can't?
[05:14:31] <PaulWay[w]> And "because this is the way it is" is not an answer.

[05:15:37] <FunkyBob> I think I know the reason, but I want you to tell us
[05:16:38] <rannnn8888> It's a little annoying that I'm saying something and fighting to tell you to do it another way I know if I could do it then I would: X

[05:19:16] <FunkyBob> not because we don't want to help, but because you're making it so we can't
[05:23:29] <PaulWay[w]> Quiet all of a sudden isn't it, FunkyBob?
[05:24:23] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob But do you understand that at the moment this is what I want to solve? Why try to test something I say I can not do right now?

[05:40:32] <Steve-Dusty81> yes, that Quacc
[05:40:40] <Steve-Dusty81> jk
[05:40:43] <PaulWay[w]> Then write it well!
[05:40:43] <FunkyBob> Quacc: sure, they can also review, comment, improve, teach
[05:41:05] <PaulWay[w]> One should always write code as if the maintenance programmer that has to look it next is a homicidal maniac who knows where you live.
[05:41:10] <Quacc> ive had a person see one of my repos once
[05:41:17] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: I do so love that saying.
[05:41:19] <dre> FunkyBob, I'm planning on opensourceing my work on Zukini
[05:41:22] <dre> :)
[05:41:27] <FunkyBob> dre: zukini?
[05:41:27] <Steve-Dusty81> how do I become a lead architect
[05:41:28] <dre> soon though I gotta tidy it up
[05:41:30] <PaulWay[w]> It is also true of sysadmins.
[05:41:41] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: spend a couple of decades refining your craft
[05:41:52] <dre> FunkyBob, the whole thing i started on when I started wallbrokening this channel :P
[05:41:54] <PaulWay[w]> Start out by being a following architect, and keep moving gradually forward.
[05:42:00] <Steve-Dusty81> huuhuih
[05:42:03] <Steve-Dusty81> decades!?
[05:42:07] <FunkyBob> dre: oh, don't be so harsh on yourself... you reason :P
[05:42:14] <dre> Steve-Dusty81, coding is love, coding is life
[05:42:19] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: it's different for different people
[05:43:03] <dre> so many things to work on ._.
[05:43:09] <Steve-Dusty81> it's harder to get accepted into Google than it is to Harvard
[05:43:27] <dre> don't go to either imo
[05:43:31] <dre> come to australia
[05:43:35] <FunkyBob> sure, but then you'd have to work at google
[05:43:41] <dre> lol
[05:43:50] <Steve-Dusty81> why australia
[05:43:55] <Steve-Dusty81> California is great
[05:43:58] <FunkyBob> anyone remember which year they ditched their "don't be evil" motto?
[05:44:05] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: how's that smoke going for y ou?
[05:44:09] <Steve-Dusty81> idk what that is
[05:44:25] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: Google used to have t heir corporate motto: Don't be evil.
[05:44:25] <PaulWay[w]> Google?  2010?
[05:44:33] <Steve-Dusty81> oh
[05:44:38] <FunkyBob> they dropped it... and are mendacious shitlords now
[05:44:48] <Quacc> i dont get how "Don't be evil" coincides with google
[05:44:58] <PaulWay[w]> Yeah, you young people wouldn't remember that.
[05:45:08] <PaulWay[w]> Back when they were just a search engine.
[05:45:14] <PaulWay[w]> And weren't also selling advertising.
[05:45:30] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: was it the same time they reformed into "Alphabet" that they dropped the motto?
[05:45:41] <PaulWay[w]> No, that was quite a bit later IIRC.
[05:45:49] <PaulWay[w]> I don't recall exactly.
[05:46:20] <PaulWay[w]> Ah, no, I'm quite wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil
[05:46:22] <Steve-Dusty81> do web developers make a lot of money?
[05:46:35] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: it varies
[05:46:58] <Steve-Dusty81> is 150K USD /year little or ok
[05:47:01] <PaulWay[w]> It changed officially to "Do the right thing" in about 2015.
[05:47:56] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: it depends
[05:49:01] <dre> <Steve-Dusty81> is 150K USD /year little or ok
[05:49:09] <PaulWay[w]> The question is: how much do you need?
[05:49:12] <dre> can you afford life on 150K USD? if so, then yes.
[05:49:27] <FunkyBob> and how much are you being asked to give for that much?
[05:49:33] <dre> ^
[05:49:54] <Steve-Dusty81> okko
[05:50:02] <FunkyBob> if oyu have to work 80h/week with a shitty team, no management support, on a project actively making lives shittier... then no, it's not enough
[05:50:31] <FunkyBob> if you work 1day/week, with an awesome team, on a project improving lives all over the globe... it'd be easier to take
[05:51:01] <dre> also don't get hung up on "web deb"
[05:51:11] <Steve-Dusty81> deb
[05:51:17] <Steve-Dusty81> stebdadeb
[05:51:20] <FunkyBob> yeah.. that web deb.... she so fickle :P
[05:51:28] <dre> just learn to program, learn how things work, you'll find aspects that you'll get into
[05:51:46] <Steve-Dusty81> I don't like being called a web dev
[05:52:06] <Steve-Dusty81> it makes me think of a person using Wix
[05:52:07] <dre> I'm using django in more of a backend / industry system, so etc
[05:52:18] <PaulWay[w]> Call yourself anything you like - even late for dinner.
[05:52:30] <FunkyBob> I used django to create a turnstile control system for a major horse racing venue...
[05:52:34] <dre> call yourself from time to time, check how things are going
[05:52:40] <dre> nice
[05:52:43] <Steve-Dusty81> is a Web developer a software engineer?
[05:52:54] <FunkyBob> dre: a vanue that... stops the nation, on occasion.
[05:53:11] <PaulWay[w]> Ah.  Sorry to hear that FunkyBob.
[05:53:12] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: typically, yes...
[05:53:21] <dre> Steve-Dusty81, titles are junky in this age; really just forget about them
[05:53:29] <Steve-Dusty81> ok
[05:53:31] <FunkyBob> not to be confused with web designers, UX researchers, Ops, SRE, and many other roles
[05:53:51] <PaulWay[w]> Who are all topological engineers.
[05:54:13] <FunkyBob> so work updated their email signatures today... apparently mine is signed "Senior Software Engineer, R and D"
[05:54:22] <dre> nice
[05:54:27] <Quacc> best title is "rare cobol user"
[05:54:27] <Steve-Dusty81> nice
[05:54:33] <Steve-Dusty81> yes
[05:54:34] <FunkyBob> had no idea I was in R&D
[05:54:36] <dre> haha
[05:54:39] <Steve-Dusty81> rare cobol user
[05:54:42] <nedbat> on linkedin i'm "software guy"
[05:54:42] <PaulWay[w]> Quacc: no, the best title is "cooked COBOL engineer"
[05:54:56] <Quacc> the rarest of rarest
[05:55:07] <PaulWay[w]> My personal title is "International Man of Mystery (Part Time)".
[05:55:16] <Steve-Dusty81> mcdonald full stack dev
[05:55:24] <Quacc> im certified dumbass
[05:55:26] <PaulWay[w]> Heh
[05:55:28] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: hahaha
[05:56:10] * FunkyBob yoinks that one
[05:56:16] <Steve-Dusty81> is it wrong to use a template for your personal website?
[05:56:28] <Steve-Dusty81> (not like i want to do it)
[05:56:29] <Quacc> what kind of template
[05:56:37] <FunkyBob> when you say template oyu mean pre-built design?
[05:56:40] <Steve-Dusty81> like a freecodecamo one
[05:56:41] <Quacc> ^
[05:56:41] <Steve-Dusty81> yes
[05:56:45] <Steve-Dusty81> pre-built one
[05:56:46] <FunkyBob> sure, if you like
[05:56:57] <Steve-Dusty81> you just need to change the text and info
[05:57:07] <Quacc> it depends on how much the template does for you
[05:57:15] <FunkyBob> Quacc: good point
[05:57:29] <FunkyBob> I was once asked to use one... wound up in 7 kinds of hell trying to modify it
[05:57:29] <Steve-Dusty81> im steb and i code a lot look at my blog
[05:57:49] <Quacc> if the template makes it so all you have to do is type 3 characters personally i would frown upon it
[05:57:57] <Quacc> but if it requires knowlege its ok
[05:58:04] <Quacc> thats just what i think though
[05:58:06] <PaulWay[w]> Use whatever works for you.
[05:58:15] <Steve-Dusty81> ok
[05:58:57] <FunkyBob> if your goal is to learn to do it yourself... it's probably a poor path
[05:59:04] <FunkyBob> if your goal is to get a nice looking site quickly... sure
[05:59:10] <FunkyBob> once again, it depends
[05:59:45] <Steve-Dusty81> how long did it take you to code your blog?
[05:59:49] <PaulWay[w]> A template is a good way to get something that looks good quickly.
[06:00:17] <Quacc> one thing templates are nice for is giving a preview of what you want something to look like
[06:00:22] <PaulWay[w]> It's then a question of how much you try to bash what you want to do into how the template works, and how much you bash the template into the shape you need to do what you want.
[06:00:25] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: the current one?
[06:00:30] <Steve-Dusty81> yes
[06:00:39] <FunkyBob> well, tht was an exercise in dogfooding my SSG... so... longer than necessary
[06:00:57] <FunkyBob> and the previous version was an exercise in dogfooding my CMS
[06:01:00] <Steve-Dusty81> what's SSG?
[06:01:07] <FunkyBob> Static Site Generator
[06:01:20] <Steve-Dusty81> you built 2 GIGANTIC websites for exercises..?
[06:01:26] <FunkyBob> since my blog site has no dynamic content, why run an app server?
[06:01:34] <FunkyBob> they're hardly gigantic
[06:01:47] <Steve-Dusty81> what's the difference between static and dynamic?
[06:02:04] <FunkyBob> dynamic means it figures out what to show you on every page request
[06:02:10] <FunkyBob> or interacts with users in some other way
[06:02:20] <FunkyBob> static... they content don't change
[06:02:32] <Steve-Dusty81> how big was your biggest website?
[06:02:38] <Steve-Dusty81> that you made by yourself
[06:02:39] <FunkyBob> www.kogan.com.au
[06:02:45] <FunkyBob> oh, by myself... umm...
[06:03:10] <FunkyBob> I usually have someone else do the design side... because I'm terrible with colours
[06:03:22] <Steve-Dusty81> ok
[06:03:52] <Steve-Dusty81> wait....
[06:03:57] <Steve-Dusty81> you helped make kogan?
[06:04:32] <Steve-Dusty81> it even have stocks
[06:04:44] <FunkyBob> i was the lead architect for that, yes
[06:05:50] <Steve-Dusty81> is it like australia's craigslist or ebay?
[06:06:11] <Steve-Dusty81> in terms of popularity
[06:06:40] <FunkyBob> neither, really... it's a retail site, not an auction site
[06:08:04] <dre> nice
[06:08:15] <Steve-Dusty81> insane
[06:08:28] <Steve-Dusty81> funkybob is like jeff bezos
[06:08:40] <Quacc> i think funkybob pays their taxes
[06:08:42] <FunkyBob> sadly, the company has some majorly obnoxious practices, like adding you to all their email spam lists _every- time you buy something, with no opt out
[06:08:47] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty81: pfft
[06:08:51] <dre> sadly
[06:09:03] <FunkyBob> if I owned kogan I might be closer to bezos...
[06:09:04] <dre> yeah kogan is crappy like that
[06:09:20] <Steve-Dusty81> oh
[06:09:22] <dre> reminds me that I gotta do tax for my monitor i bought from kogan
[06:09:24] <Steve-Dusty81> you don't own kogan?
[06:09:31] <Steve-Dusty81> :(
[06:09:42] <FunkyBob> i helped build the web site...
[06:09:43] <dre> FunkyBob, so you're the reason I had such a pleasant online shopping experience
[06:10:01] <FunkyBob> dre: there was a great team of talented people who helped me ;)
[06:10:01] <Steve-Dusty81> so the CEO of website don't code?
[06:10:16] <dre> unless you become a CEO Steve-Dusty81
[06:10:28] <dre> btw you should work on zukini with me ;)
[06:10:36] <Steve-Dusty81> i am noob
[06:10:38] <Quacc> whats zukini
[06:10:43] <Steve-Dusty81> what's zukini anyways

[06:14:27] <stats4647> Hi, I am writing tests for DRF and am finding that if I do o1 = Obj.objects.create() then do factory.delete() with view(request, pk=o1.id), I get a 404, but if I create the record through POST (as opposed to directly with the ORM), it works fine. Does anyone know why this is?
[06:14:49] <FunkyBob> erm
[06:14:59] <FunkyBob> what is factory in this example?
[06:15:02] <PaulWay[w]> factory.delete?
[06:15:40] <PaulWay[w]> What are we trying to test there stats4647?
[06:16:18] <stats4647> factory = APIRequestFactory()
[06:16:33] <stats4647> trying to test the DELETE endpoint
[06:17:09] <stats4647> GinFuyou: thanks for pointing me to the Libera chat!
[06:17:20] <PaulWay[w]> I haven't used that before.  I tend to use test.Client.
[06:17:22] <Steve-Dusty81> ^ he did that for me too
[06:17:57] <PaulWay[w]> At a first guess stats4647 I'd say that your former example hasn't actually created the object.
[06:18:08] <PaulWay[w]> So I'd check that it in fact has, first.
[06:23:02] <PaulWay[w]> schinckel: thought you might be amused to see the shape of the query: https://dpaste.org/wq0T
[06:23:24] <PaulWay[w]> If there's a better way, then I'm happy to hear it.
[06:23:41] <PaulWay[w]> I also tried basing both queries on Upload - made no difference to the query plan AFAICS.
[06:24:02] <stats4647> PaulWay[w]: doing Obj.objects.get(id = ID) seems to work, and doing  GET on other objects which have a FK to the objects I create also seems to work, but maybe there is some issue with transactions
[06:24:23] <PaulWay[w]> SHouldn't be unless you know yourself to be in one...

[06:26:36] <FunkyBob> stats4647: are they happening in the same process/thread?
[06:26:47] <FunkyBob> the creation of hte object, and the processing of the request
[06:27:25] <PaulWay[w]> IF this is run in the test suite, then it should be in the same thread AFAIK...
[06:27:28] <stats4647> FunkyBob: both calls are in the same function, not sure if that answers your question though
[06:27:48] <FunkyBob> so... most likely
[06:28:59] <stats4647> PaulWay[w]: maybe doing an ORM get() is different from what DRF is doing behind the scenes to handle a DELETE request  ...

[06:34:52] <FunkyBob> is the view doing some other filtering on the queryset, and thus not finidng the record?
[06:35:02] <stats4647> anyway, not a show stopper, i thought maybe there was something obvious i didn't know about
[06:35:56] <stats4647> FunkyBob: I am using the default DELETE implementation from the ViewSet so I don't think so, given the pk it should find it
[06:37:05] <FunkyBob> i don't know a lot about DRF... but did you specify a queryset for that view set?
[06:40:46] <stats4647> FunkyBob: I did, that's how the methods work (POST, GET, DELETE), it's only when you create the object through the ORM but try deleting it through DRF / DELETE that it gives 404

[08:27:12] <Steve-Dusty> I don't need to import sh*t

[12:33:32] <VaniaPy> Kim^J i'm trying to model a Hospital and i need a user to take the coordinates(location) of this Hospital as an attribute
[12:33:40] <VaniaPy> the user is a separate model
[12:34:43] <Kim^J> So you want both User and Hospital to have a relation to the same Location ?
[12:36:56] <GinFuyou> ^ that sound more reasonable
[12:37:30] <GinFuyou> Though, why user can't have relation directly to hospital?
[12:37:38] <Kim^J> Yeah, that sounds even better.

[12:39:00] <Kim^J> GinFuyou: Do you remember why?
[12:39:49] <VaniaPy> Kim^J yes,to the same location
[12:40:40] <Kim^J> VaniaPy: Ok, you want a normal models.ForeignKey then. Nothing more special than that.
[12:40:43] <GinFuyou> They have some nonsensical model structure where "ordered" was a boolean field on shoe model or something like that. And story was it needs "multi-user" support and not really a e-commerce so there no real orders
[12:40:57] <Kim^J> GinFuyou: Ah, understandable.
[12:41:10] <GinFuyou> So, I went with something that at least works
[12:41:37] <GinFuyou> Apparently it turned out they wanted something completely different, but I don't care anymore
[12:41:47] <Kim^J> Yeah
[12:42:14] <VaniaPy> Kim^J ok ok,that was my question,if i need to set the "location" field of the Hospital explicitly to the User or just pass the Hospital model as ForeignKey
[12:42:45] <Kim^J> I'm leaning heavily on trying to get them to implement a normal commerce flow with products/orders/rows, but they just point towards you xD
[12:43:44] <Kim^J> VaniaPy: Well, technically, you can do whatever. But, logically, what are you trying to represent? Is the User a Visitor to a Hospital? Is the User an Administrator of the Hospital? An Employee? Etc
[12:44:42] <VaniaPy> Kim^J A paramedic let's say that doens't belong to the current Hospital but he needs to take the address and go there
[12:45:31] <Kim^J> And why do you want to model this on the User model?
[12:45:54] <Kim^J> This sounds more like a WorkOrder or similar.
[12:46:06] <Kim^J> That is, you tell a User to do X at Hospital Y
[12:46:16] <jor> the person should 'go' to the hospital, not the location/address. Addresses can change :)
[12:47:12] <Kim^J> jor: Actually, they shouldn't go to the hospital, they should go to a specific department in the hospital xD
[12:47:41] <GinFuyou> There is a number of details that decide your structure for sure
[12:47:43] <Kim^J> I have a fairly small hospital nearby and their campus stretches almost a km xD
[12:48:41] <Kim^J> And if you needed to go the ER and lookup the hospital address, you'd end up in the main entrance, which is nowhere near the ER.

[16:20:01] <eldar> for example [IsApprovedUser & isEventOwner]
[16:20:25] <eldar> the problem is that new class AND is created

[16:30:36] <eldar> :(
[16:30:49] <jor> hmm? I mean implement a new permission class, e.g. IsApprovedAndOwner... not sure what the problem with that is
[16:33:02] <jor> eldar: what probably 'not pretty' is that you are already mixin some 'custom message' into the permissions, which should probably be outside it anyway
[16:33:46] <eldar> why?
[16:34:22] <eldar> I mean class attribute message in BasePermission class
[16:35:20] <eldar> I understand you.  IsApprovedAndOwner may be a good solution, but my business logic is more complex
[16:36:21] <eldar> for example https://dpaste.org/OHp1
[16:44:30] <jor> ahh, I see. was thinking your were doing some custom logic.
[16:44:58] <jor> eldar: seems a bit of an oversight in drf, long standing issue open for it: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/issues/6427
[16:45:55] <eldar> yeap(
[16:46:12] <eldar> thank u for link!
[16:47:17] *** Quits: explore (uid233125@id-233125.stonehaven.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[16:48:55] <jor> if you are creating them on the fly, might as well set a .message property then as a workaround :/
[16:49:54] <eldar> I can set only one message
[16:50:05] <eldar> but what if the second permissions will fail
[16:50:06] <jor> but still, i'd go with a custom class, and pass thost 'actions' into it. so the logic is where i'd expect to loop for it :/
[16:50:19] <jor> s/loop/look/
[16:51:07] <eldar> you mean to make these if-s depending on action in custom permissions class?
[16:51:12] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[16:55:26] <jor> yeah, probably. But I already find your 'actions' confusing. Since drf has @actions and methods, and this seems somewhere inbetween those
[16:56:51] <eldar> these action are methods of ViewSet, are not them?
[16:57:31] <jor> yeah, for adding extra/non-standard views
[16:57:36] <eldar> I just dynamically set permissions depending on action
[16:58:08] <eldar> on standard actions like retrieve list and so on
[16:58:58] <jor> but anyway, the permission API is bascially has_permission(request, view), so normally, with request and view, you can figure out it without any other state
[17:03:37] <jor> (I guess what I actualy mean is, use view.action)

[19:24:01] <eldar> Guys, how to implement permissions for nested resources in REST API in DRF?
[19:24:53] <eldar> for example I have endpoints /events /event-organizations
[19:25:08] <eldar> (sry, I mean related resources)
[19:25:40] <eldar> Event Organization has a foreign key field related to Event Model
[19:25:57] <hylje> i'd just hit that nail with a Permission subclass hammer
[19:26:03] <eldar> And i have IsEventOwner
[19:26:23] <eldar> And I want to use isEventOwner class in both Viewsets
[19:26:27] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[19:27:10] <eldar> I need to restrict POST /event-organization only for owner of event
[19:28:22] <eldar> and want use isEventOwner for restricting
[19:29:17] <CodenameTim> I would create a separate permission for this other viewset that has a relation to Event. Otherwise you're going to end up having to inspect the class to determine how to find the event and by extension the owner.
[19:29:52] <hylje> yup, which you can do, but having two simple permission classes is better than one kitchen sink class
[19:30:10] <eldar> I made sth like u say
[19:30:11] <eldar> https://dpaste.org/Fzvy
[19:30:41] <CodenameTim> For restricting the permissions check for POSTs, the DRF docs give an example that's similar to what you want: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#custom-permissions
[19:33:21] <IceMichael> for parameters not really used, _ is convenient, but what if there are multiple?
[19:33:36] <hylje> you can name MULTIPLE parameters as _ :-)
[19:33:44] <IceMichael> nah, got an error :/
[19:33:55] <hylje> um, _1, _2 etc?
[19:34:02] <IceMichael> sure
[19:34:12] <IceMichael> but well, still IDEs show it as "unused var"
[19:34:14] <IceMichael> with _ not
[19:34:18] <IceMichael> that's why I was hoping...
[19:34:26] <CodenameTim> You shouldn't. `_, _, _ = (1, 2, 3)` is valid?
[19:34:43] <CodenameTim> What kind of error is it? Is it a linter error?
[19:34:49] <IceMichael> yeah, but I override a function in a subclass where not all parameters are needed
[19:35:00] <hylje> plop them in *args, **kwargs?
[19:35:18] <IceMichael> I could, but... hm, then rather write them out here, I feel
[19:35:23] <nedbat> IceMichael: which linter is it?
[19:35:36] <eldar> hylje, " but having two simple permission classes is better than one kitchen sink class" Why?
[19:35:40] <hylje> CodenameTim: unfortunately you can't define a function like "def foo(_,_): pass"
[19:36:04] <hylje> eldar: simpler to understand when you read the code in two years
[19:36:31] <IceMichael> nedbat, don't know from top of my head, I usually check VSC hints
[19:38:07] <nedbat> IceMichael: ok. pylint can be configured to ignore a pattern, like unused_*
[19:40:15] <IceMichael> ah nice, thanks
[19:40:28] <IceMichael> so, there is no common way for that, understood

[22:55:42] <hEXE90> I must have done something wrong

[22:57:34] <hEXE90> Wow, that was so simple, I can't believe it.
[22:59:01] <hEXE90> So transaction__date__date follows the foreignkey, selects date, then casts to date from datetime... is that understanding correct?
[22:59:14] <knbk> yes, that's correct
[23:00:43] <hEXE90> So is a subquery mainly used when there is no foreignkey relationship between two distinct models?
[23:03:13] <hEXE90> Also, is the revision CodenameTim posted (https://dpaste.org/wBzt) counting the number of expression objects?
[23:03:53] <knbk> that's one usecase. transaction__date creates a join, when you have a lot of aggregates in one query that use different relations that doesn't always scale well, so subqueries can be useful
