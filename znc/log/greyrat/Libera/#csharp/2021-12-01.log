[09:43:26] <MizMahem> Really simple. Take some salmon filets, season them nicely as you like. Salt, pepper obviously, I also like to use this greek seasoning called Cavenders a lot.
[09:44:43] <moose> The seasoning is salt, pepper, garlic, and msg lol
[09:45:03] <moose> I don't knock MSG, it's wonderful
[09:45:10] <moose> Just not very good for us, but hey what is
[09:45:19] <MizMahem> Then mix together some cornstarch and water as well as what you want to bread with. I used crushed up ritz crackers this time, but breadcrumbs, or like corn meal, lots of stuff can work. Dip in the cornstarch, then in the breading, and bam, yer done.
[09:45:33] <moose> Nice
[09:45:36] <moose> I will give it a shot this week
[09:45:50] <MizMahem> if you don't dry the fish first you can try just putting the cornstarch straight onto the fish, but I've had mixed results with this.
[09:45:52] <moose> I've deep fried salmon before, it came out nice but never like this
[09:46:05] <MizMahem> this is *so* easy.
[09:46:11] <MizMahem> 6 minutes or so a side
[09:46:15] <moose> Yeah, I found out with the deep frying and everything else involving salmon, dry it
[09:46:34] <MizMahem> well sure if you are deep frying, lol. Oil and water and all that.
[09:46:59] <moose> Hm, never thought of it that way XD
[09:47:11] <MizMahem> Also, hey! Cavenders has oregano in there as well :p
[09:47:26] <moose> Yeah true, it has more than I said haha
[09:47:35] <moose> But the important things are first!
[09:47:49] <MizMahem> well garlic and msg are important, lol :p
[09:47:57] <moose> I'll also give that a try, never had it before. Seems like it may be similar to johnny's
[09:48:05] <moose> Just a bit more light, better for fish
[09:48:24] <moose> There's one called nature's seasons that I like on white fish and vegetables
[09:48:29] <moose> Pretty common around here
[09:49:43] <MizMahem> for thanksgiving I made this though: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/tdNtS546/20211125_183641.jpg Salmon en Croute
[09:49:55] <MizMahem> which looks fancy but is also actually super simple.

[09:54:42] <moose> Looks wonderful
[09:55:42] <MizMahem> yeah `sprouts and taters. Just me and SO for thanksgiving so nothing super duper fancy.

[10:13:19] <moose> Is it common in Denmark for people to put additives on their driveway to stop ice or does it just snow so much it is pointless?
[10:13:38] <jmer> we use salt
[10:13:59] <moose> here in my part of the US we use magnesium chloride

[10:27:33] <moose> It's more like a 30 min drive. 45km away
[10:28:17] <sysRPL> so i've aggressively writing pre optimizations for my native code and am wondering if i am going a bit far
[10:28:47] <sysRPL> pre optimizations are those that are made before any bottlenecks or slowdowns occur
[10:29:21] <sysRPL> this is native code mind you, and one thing i al doing is trying to cache common objects in a reusable stack
[10:29:24] <moose> depends on how crazy you're getting haha
[10:29:43] <moose> caching i think is a fine design pattern, crazy would be writing inline assembly or writing code that is hard to understand to exploit the hardware/compiler
[10:29:47] <sysRPL> but i am unsure if it akes any difference with regarrds to execution speed
[10:29:56] <moose> the golden rule: profile!
[10:30:05] <sysRPL> i don't have a profiler
[10:30:26] <sysRPL> or i;ve never used one
[10:30:35] <sysRPL> maybe i should learn to use one
[10:30:51] <sysRPL> can i describe how my object caching works?
[10:30:53] <moose> sure
[10:31:21] <moose> I like performance optimization talk actually, so I am going to not be the one telling you "ah you're doing too much!" probably :D
[10:31:40] <sysRPL> for commonly used and thrown away objects like pens, matrix, xmlnode ... i create a list of 100 of those object each at the start of the program
[10:32:30] <ki9a> I don't think xmlnode is worth it to be honest. That allocates tons of sub objects
[10:32:31] <sysRPL> and whenever you need a pen or xmlnode i take one from this list ifn't it's not being used isntead of allocating a new object each time and destroying them after use
[10:32:38] <sysRPL> BUT
[10:33:16] <sysRPL> i have to search the list for unused items ... which may result in wasted time versus just creating using and destroying
[10:33:28] <sysRPL> so i am unsure if my system is worthwhile
[10:33:42] <ki9a> sysRPL: you could do it the other way around.. Instead of storing all cached objects, cache released ones
[10:33:48] <ki9a> does mean you need to release it after use ofc.
[10:33:57] <ki9a> Then you never have to search your lsits.
[10:34:11] <sysRPL> ki9a: these objects are all itnerface objects (pascal) IPen, INode
[10:34:18] <moose> i would do what ki9a says here, if you create one, use it, then throw it in a bag or something and use it again later up to a certain number of cached ones
[10:34:22] <ki9a> that makes little difference?
[10:34:26] <moose> I think that is what ki9a is implying anyway
[10:34:30] <ki9a> When using, remove it from the list
[10:34:33] <ki9a> when releasing, add it back
[10:34:38] <moose> Yeah, that too.
[10:34:39] <sysRPL> ki9a: i am intercepting the reference counting
[10:34:40] <ki9a> no need to search, anything in the list is by definition free
[10:34:49] <ki9a> sysRPL: again, same thign though?
[10:34:55] <ki9a> that's an implementation detail.
[10:35:04] <sysRPL> hrmmm
[10:35:14] <sysRPL> okay maybe
[10:35:29] <moose> I often do this kind of thing with sockets, I store my SocketAsyncEventArgs in a ConcurrentBag<SocketAsyncEventArgs> and have 3 bags, one for reader, one for writer, one for acceptor
[10:35:29] <sysRPL> that might work i need to think about it
[10:35:57] <moose> So you check one out, you return it to the bag when you are done, the bag is unordered and access is O(1) for both insert and take
[10:36:01] <ki9a> I have a "ResultList" class which is what I use to store the result of any enumeration in my compiler
[10:36:33] <ki9a> var rl = ResultList.Pool.New(); aType.GetMembers(Accesstype.ShowAll, MemberType.Property | memberType.Static, "Name", rl)
[10:36:39] <ki9a> I do teh same object pooling
[10:36:55] <sysRPL> i will try redesigning the list to store only recycled objects
[10:36:55] <ki9a> resultlist.Pool.Free releases it back in the list. It only caches up to 10 or so
[10:37:10] <sysRPL> but not straight away. i have to finish this other thing first
[10:38:02] <sysRPL> thanks for the input guys
[10:38:54] <sysRPL> ki9a: this is a demo i wrote the other night as part of my vector and ui widgetset toolkit -> https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/synthwave

[10:46:22] <ki9a> Proper profiling requires instrumentation
[10:47:32] <sysRPL> my current project is converting svg documents into 2D physics scenes
[10:48:57] <sysRPL> that is, you use a program like inkscape to draw a 2D scene, and my program converts it into a physics simulation with motors, springs, hinges, deformable bodies and so on
[10:50:33] <ki9a> nice.
[10:51:11] <sysRPL> i wrote an extension to my svg parser allowing for optional user defined properties on svg elements or css sections that can inform my physics program about the density, friction, elasticity, motors, joints or other physics stuff associated with which svg elements
[10:52:22] <sysRPL> it builds upon this other demo program in my library -> https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/catapult/
[10:53:30] <sysRPL> in that demo drawing is done inside the demo program. i want more complicated persistent drawing and think an editr like inkscpae and the svg format would suite this requirement

[11:24:55] <tsujp> I have a Member table, and a Membership table. Members have 1:N Memberships. I can create a member via .AddAsync() then create the Membership using that newly created Member's Id but is there a way to do that in a single call and let EF know that the Membership's MemberId foreign key should be set to the Member being made in this very EF call?
[11:25:01] <tsujp> Does that make sense?
[11:26:27] <pandem> you can use a navigation property
[11:26:51] <pandem> if you have a foreign key it should exist by default
[11:27:04] <biberu> tsujp: here are examples of one to many relationships: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/relationships
[11:27:33] <moose> jmer: lucky!
[11:28:17] <jmer> moose:  well... there's two sides of that medal... the taxi driver that takes the youngest to school wasn't able to drive... So he came back with him... So now I have a kid home and I'm supposed to work >.<
[11:28:48] <moose> Oh yes that is a thing
[11:29:02] <moose> Old enough to do their own thing or young enough to demand attention 24x7? haha
[11:29:27] <jmer> he's 7... so he can take care of himself... but then he has autism and ADHD... So... It really depends on his mood :P
[11:29:31] <tsujp> I'm confused by this: `Member.AddAsync("Jim", new Membership(_need_jims_id_here, "Food"))`
[11:29:39] <tsujp> The docs page I found has .Entity stuff not .Add
[11:30:49] <tsujp> Navigation proxies look like they are used for loading data
[11:30:52] <tsujp> I am inserting new data
[11:31:42] <pandem> the same can be used for inserting
[11:31:59] <pandem> you just assign your membership to the navigation property and i think ef inserts it correctly
[11:33:32] <moose> Yes right until you do it concurrently and you get an id conflict for the dependent entry and not for the parent entry :)
[11:33:44] <tsujp> I'm confused on how to do that..
[11:33:46] <moose> Then good luck resolving that.
[11:34:21] <tsujp> How am I supposed to use a navigation proxy if I don't have anything unique to select by _until_ it's actually propagated to the underlying DB
[11:34:29] *** Quits: jstoker (~jstoker@user/jstoker) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:34:53] <pandem> i would assume it would not have concurrency issues but not 100% sure
[11:35:04] <tsujp> Surely there is a better way than `var member = db.Add(new Member("Jim")); member.Membership(member.Id, "Food"))` <---- this pattern sucks, can it not be done all at once?
[11:35:06] <pandem> if there's an identity on the table it should be fine, i guess
[11:35:06] <moose> pandem: EF is not concurrency safe in how it interacts with MSSQL at all.
[11:35:17] <moose> pandem: Also, nope :)
[11:35:47] <moose> I ran into this problem and it was the worst experience ever. You will get a primary key violation when you do concurrent inserts; it's something you definitely need to detect and recover from with retry logic.
[11:36:01] <biberu> tsujp: did you check the first example on the page i linked?
[11:36:13] <moose> And you will need to make sure you are using transactions if you have any kind of related data going in at the same time.
[11:36:28] <moose> EF is cool, but it has some weird gotchas.
[11:36:31] <pandem> does ef savechanges not use a transaction
[11:37:03] <moose> It depends on how it's configured, but by default I don't think so. I have not used it for anything too complicated recently, so I very well could be wrong if it changed in a recent version.
[11:37:06] <pandem> In all versions of Entity Framework, whenever you execute SaveChanges() to insert, update or delete on the database the framework will wrap that operation in a transaction.
[11:37:20] <tsujp> biberu yes and I don't understand what I am looking at, that's about defining the models AFAIK. The models are already defined, I just want to insert data in one call and not several.
[11:37:31] <moose> pandem: But does it wrap each individual change or does it wrap the entire unit of work?
[11:37:34] *** Joins: jstoker (~jstoker@user/jstoker)
[11:37:35] <moose> I think the former.
[11:37:50] <moose> So you end up with a transaction to insert the parent object, a transaction to insert the dependent object
[11:38:16] <pandem> that wouldnt make a whole lot of sense
[11:38:24] <tsujp> moose "So you end up with a transaction to insert the parent object, a transaction to insert the dependent object" this is what I am getting at. I don't care if EF does it that way under the hood but do I, as the programmer, have to write it that way?
[11:38:49] <moose> tsujp: You do not need to write it that way, and you should care.
[11:39:05] <tsujp> Cool so how do I write it because I'm not seeing anything on these pages
[11:39:08] <pandem> i would say dont worry about concurrency, just write it and if there are concurrency issues then try to solve them
[11:39:13] <biberu> tsujp: iirc it should be enough to just add a post to the collection in the blog and save it
[11:39:21] <moose> pandem: Unless it's going to cost a business lots of money or customers hardship.
[11:39:41] <moose> tsujp: Basically all you should need to do is add the element to the list and save it as biberu said.
[11:39:47] <moose> It will figure it out for you.
[11:39:51] <biberu> tsujp: i.e. ef should set the blogid (your member id) automatically
[11:40:01] <tsujp> But I'm not adding a single element...
[11:40:06] <tsujp> How.. I cannot just null the field
[11:40:08] <moose> I recall in EF you had to do this thing, like set a property as modified... but that was without automatic tracking I think
[11:40:19] <moose> tsujp: You are adding more than one? It'll still work.
[11:40:23] <tsujp> `var member = db.Add(new Member("Jim")); member.Membership(member.Id, "Food"))` becomes what? `Member.AddAsync("Jim", new Membership(WHAT_GOES_HERE, "Food"))`

[11:41:05] <moose> Correct. If it's a foreign key, it'll know how to handle it.
[11:41:06] <moose> Yes.
[11:41:41] <biberu> that's an odd constructor for an ef entity btw
[11:41:48] <tsujp> Where is that documented because I didn't see it expressed, I only saw documentation on making a model and what not
[11:41:49] <moose> But also you have a weird relationship there, I think. Your membership is tied to one user?
[11:42:07] <tsujp> members (users) have N memberships
[11:42:15] <biberu> like blogs have N posts
[11:42:16] <tsujp> should be List<Membership> but I kept it simpler
[11:42:18] <moose> Can a membership be assigned to more than one user?
[11:42:26] <tsujp> It's exactly the same as blogs and posts

[13:02:01] <moose> Same way they call anyone over the age of 21 a boomer
[13:02:45] <moose> Also for anyone who needs a satellite phone, they're on sale still for the cyber monday things.
[13:03:28] <moose> It's one of those big ticket items everyone who works in tech should have, and grab on sale, IMO. Never know when prod will break when you're in Antarctica
[13:04:48] <Tobbi_> Satellite phone...
[13:04:59] <moose> Yeah, I just got one today. Very happy. $400 off.
[13:07:55] <Tobbi_> So whenever you want to make a phone call, you have to launch yourself into space?
[13:07:59] <Tobbi_> Sounds rather inconvenient.
[13:08:04] <moose> Yep, precisely.
[13:08:12] <moose> I actually just launch the phone into space and leave the handset with me.
[13:08:15] <Tobbi_> :D
[13:08:28] <moose> It then docks with the space station and they place a collect call over the hydrogen line for me
[13:08:32] <Tobbi_> Ah
[13:08:38] <moose> Yep, you can find it up on 2.4 GHz
[13:08:41] <Tobbi_> I thought it'd just be in orbit...
[13:08:48] <Tobbi_> And then you'd have to be "really" quick.
[13:08:50] <moose> Well, it is technically, since the space station is.
[13:08:51] <Tobbi_> For it to not go out of range
[13:08:52] <MatthiasVance> Orbit is too dangerous nowadays
[13:08:55] <moose> They usually hang out the airlock and just grab it.
[13:09:01] <MatthiasVance> With all that space debris from shooting down stuff
[13:09:04] <Tobbi_> true

[16:40:27] <MaNa2k> ki9a, i see
[16:40:41] <MaNa2k> and we need to use pull request as well
[16:40:50] <ki9a> basically you set it up that prs are (partially) built, unit tested before they can be merged.
[16:40:50] <jonp> pull requests come from branches

[16:40:54] <biberu> viaSanctus: you may e.g. want to enforce schemas or constraints, query your data in different ways, you need to check if your storage solution supports the operations you need and not just choose based on a fad

[16:41:11] <ki9a> pull requests
[16:41:15] <MaNa2k> ok ok

[16:42:24] <viaSanctus> but still i wanted to know what is best IF i wanted to add it anyway
[16:42:26] <ki9a> MaNa2k: unit tests on the api levels. Other tests take longer and run async on already merged logic

[16:43:12] <viaSanctus> ki9a, no i only "know" postgres, oracle and mssql :p

[17:05:15] <ki9a> ah
[17:05:28] <StevePerk> Perhaps a dumb newbie question, but when when using a Linq ".Select()", is it possible to pass a multi-line statement block (with a return statement) rather than an expression?  I've seen examples with predicates, where the predicate is constructed separately and assigned to a delegate variable that's passed.  But surely there's syntax for doing

[17:10:17] <jmer> MatthiasVance: can't you just use subdomains?
[17:10:34] <MatthiasVance> For Exchange I can't, I am not sure what the impact is on B2C
[17:10:47] <jmer> I mean tfor the b2c
[17:11:55] <MatthiasVance> Yeah not sure if people would get e-mails from "@subdomain.myproduct.com", which would SUCK
[17:13:25] <MatthiasVance> If I drop in Auth0 it would Just Work (tm)
[17:14:06] <jmer> yeah but auth0 is very, very expensive compared to b2c which is "free" if you allready have an Azure AD
[17:14:16] <jmer> and by free I mean the first 50k users is free iirc
[17:22:34] <MaNa2k> so if you have a method returning a object, but if the object is null, do you return null or throw exceptions ?
[17:23:15] <MaNa2k> what is good practice ?
[17:25:13] <interop_madness> if null is an exceptional case, throw exception
[17:25:34] <interop_madness> otherwise bool TryGetFoo(..., out Foo foo) { ... }
[17:25:47] <MaNa2k> in case some shit happens and that object dosnt get initied or filled with nessesary data
[17:25:57] <biberu> if you've promised to return something but can't, then returning nothing might cause problems in other places where's it's harder to trace cause, especially if you aren't using NRTs
[17:25:59] <MaNa2k> trygetfoo ?
[17:26:27] <MaNa2k> hmm
[17:26:29] <MaNa2k> whta is nrt
[17:27:13] <biberu> personally i like to return an option when possible, otherwise maybe a try-version, an exception if neither of those work, but would not return null unless that's what i'm promising the caller (and i generally wouldn't do that)
[17:27:52] <biberu> MaNa2k: nullable reference type
[17:28:02] <interop_madness> Dictionary<TKey, TValue> for instance does both: dict.TryGetValue("mykey", out value) and value = dict["mykey"]; // throws if mykey was not found
[17:28:08] <biberu> i'd avoid that too though
[17:28:16] <MaNa2k> biberu, yea vs22 nags too much about nullables
[17:28:26] <biberu> if you do have nulls they are fine for modelling it, but would not introduce nulls unless absolutely required
[17:28:34] <MaNa2k> interop_madness, mhm i see
[17:30:04] <biberu> MaNa2k: it's "nagging" about it because your code isn't handling possible nulls
[17:30:11] <Slade> Microsoft's Satya Nadella Sold Half of His Shares in the Company $MSFT
[17:30:17] <biberu> if you write it differently it stops ^^
[17:30:57] <MaNa2k> hmm
[17:31:20] <biberu> MaNa2k: you can turn those warnings into errors too, that'll ensure that people aren't just ignoring them
[17:31:35] <MaNa2k> hmm. thats a good idea lol
[17:32:12] <MaNa2k> the problem is, we migrated our old code to vs22 and .net 6, and theres like over hundreds of places with that warning
[17:32:37] <biberu> those are hundreds of possible bugs
[17:33:09] <MaNa2k> hmm
[17:33:51] <biberu> (note that by returning null you'd have introduced another such case that every caller needs to handle, that every caller needs to have a test written for)
[17:34:19] <jmer> I've seen code that just defaulted to returning null if unexpected shit happened
[17:34:46] <MaNa2k> lol, thats basically what we do some places
[17:34:59] <MaNa2k> anyway, so the best practive would be to throw some ecpetion right ?
[17:35:05] <jmer> You should throw exceptions instead of just returning nulls with no meaning xD
[17:35:22] <jmer> MaNa2k: It depends, but mostly yes.
[17:35:22] <biberu> or TryFoo, or return Option<Foo>
[17:35:29] <jmer> Options are nice as well
[17:35:41] <MaNa2k> jmer, we sometimes log in catch the e, then return null
[17:35:55] <MaNa2k> that whay we know if theres an error someplace
[17:36:09] <biberu> Try doesn't compose, but might be more approachable and people should know how to handle both cases

[17:37:20] <MaNa2k> i know about int, but when your working with a class object, what then ?
[17:38:38] <biberu> it's just a method with an out parameter that returns a bool that says if it's safe to use
[17:38:42] <MaNa2k> the only test i can do is if (myObj == null) { log("myObj is null"), return null; }

[18:24:19] <MatthiasVance> I bought one though =/
[18:24:33] <MatthiasVance> Danfoss is not multi zone is it?
[18:24:37] <MatthiasVance> Tado is the only multi zone I could find
[18:24:46] <Nasp> What do you mean with multi zone?
[18:24:53] <Nasp> As in only on temperure for all?
[18:25:03] <MatthiasVance> No, different temperatures per zone
[18:25:39] <Nasp> As in during the way?
[18:25:43] <Nasp> Or combine two thermostats into one?
[18:25:52] <MatthiasVance> Like with a single zone system you have 1 thermostat in your living room that controls your heating system
[18:25:52] <Nasp> Due to them being in the same room
[18:26:11] <Nasp> My Tado are all zingle zone
[18:26:18] <Nasp> Although two of them are in the same room, not sure you can do that?
[18:26:21] <MatthiasVance> And with a multi zone system when the living room is at temperature it will still turn on the heating system if my office isn't
[18:26:32] <MatthiasVance> So I have 2 zones: Living Room + Office, works perfectly
[18:26:40] <MatthiasVance> (except for the TVR situation)
[18:27:36] <Nasp> hmm still not surei get what you are at

[18:28:35] <MatthiasVance> Any one zone / room can request heating from your heating system
[18:28:58] <MatthiasVance> With a regular single-zone system, the heating system stops if your thermostat is at temperature, even though other rooms might not be yet

[18:33:02] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: You dont have thermostats then but just centrally controlled or?
[18:36:51] <canton7> MatthiasVance, I have evohome as a multi-zone system -- very happy with it
[18:37:52] <canton7> 8 zones and counting :D
[18:40:31] <Nasp> counting? How many rooms do you have
[18:47:20] <MatthiasVance> canton7: Yeah I looked at Evohome but it seemed more expensive.
[18:47:41] <MatthiasVance> canton7: Do the different zones use radiator sensors or external temperature sensors?
[18:47:47] <MatthiasVance> (as in just the TVR / valve)
[18:49:13] <canton7> MatthiasVance, Yeah it's not hugely cheap, but worth it IMO. I've got a mix going on. All of the TRVs have a sensor, but in some rooms the radiators are behind something or for some reason the TRV doesn't give an accurate reading, or I want to be able to easily change the setpoint from a thing on the wall, so I have external sensors in those rooms
[18:50:04] <canton7> The really nice thing about Evohome is that I get full functionality without need an app / PC -- if the wifi dies, or internet goes down, or whatever, I don't lose anything at all
[18:50:14] <canton7> *without needing an
[18:51:00] <MatthiasVance> canton7: Ah yeah, exactly the same setup here (soon with external sensors). Also don't need internet to configure anything.
[18:51:08] <MatthiasVance> Except if you want to use the app, for some reason
[18:51:33] <canton7> Including setting schedules etc?
[18:51:33] <MatthiasVance> I think the TRV would be fine if the water temperature would be lower, maybe I should have tried that first.. could have saved money lol
[18:51:56] <MatthiasVance> canton7: I .. don't think so. Which is weird.
[18:52:47] <MatthiasVance> "All rooms that can’t access the internet will be shown as having no remote access in the app. Also, your devices won’t be able to access their Smart Schedules. They’ll continue to operate with the last active setting until the internet connection is restored."
[18:52:50] <canton7> Looking at it, I'm not sure Tado was around when I got into this. Does it to the thing where it figures out how early it needs to turn on the heating to hit your setpoints by their set times?
[18:52:59] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[18:53:06] <canton7> Ah, fun. Evohome's little touchscreen thingy is entirely self-contained
[18:53:20] <MatthiasVance> I have turned that off because the water temp is set to 80C so it's warm pretty fast
[18:53:40] <canton7> Ah nice, our house has some quirks which means some of the rooms take a good 3 hours to heat up in the morning
[18:54:01] <k0fein> guys, is it ok to throw an exception from within a try / catch block directly? I mean, doesn't that code smell? Example: https://pastebin.com/189Fadkk
[18:54:04] <MatthiasVance> Oh then that's a necessity, glad you have multizoning then
[18:54:16] <MatthiasVance> And modular OpenTherm I'm guessing?
[18:54:35] <canton7> k0fein, up to you. I do it sometimes
[18:54:39] <Nasp> k0fein:  Are yyou rethrowing the exception
[18:55:06] <k0fein> Nasp: no, that supposed to be final state and exception should not propagate further
[18:55:10] <canton7> The boiler doesn't have opentherm sadly, otherwise I would. Tbh I don't think it makes much difference, as the boiler seems to modulate its output depending on the temperature of the water it's heating anyway
[18:55:20] <k0fein> Nasp: only reason for it is I'll not write duplicit code
[18:55:37] <MatthiasVance> canton7: Ah, right. It might be "smart in another way" :D
[18:55:55] <MatthiasVance> I am still deciding whether I want to program a lighting flow for our entire house
[18:56:04] <MatthiasVance> Because you can't be sure who is in what room, needs some guesswork when there's movement
[18:56:17] <MatthiasVance> There is no system smart enough iirc that can do things like that
[18:56:37] <MatthiasVance> Like, during work I sometimes sit still longer than <treshold>, but once I leave I want it to turn off almost immediately
[18:59:16] <canton7> Heh I decided against that -- seems like an unsolvable problem which is just annoying when it's not working right. You need to predict when people will enter rooms anyway
[19:00:18] <canton7> The rooms here can hold their temperature for an hour or so anyway before they drop 1C, so it's not much of a problem if you e.g. sit working longer than expected. It's more of a problem if you weren't planning to use a room, then you go in and it's freezing
[19:01:33] <interop_madness> so, apropos heating, I thought I'd just "quickly buy" digital radiator thermostats which I can then hook up to some central controller and everything is smooth sailing...
[19:02:33] <interop_madness> turns out, the radiator valves are not compatible, so they have to be replaced. this affects the central heating for all parties of the house, so they ALL have to be coordinated to be home at a certain day, so the pluber can refill and vent the radiators
[19:03:12] <interop_madness> if just ONE person can't make it on any given day, I have to pay the plumber to come again and meanwhile said person's flat will be cold(er)

[19:35:57] <earthy> no, that I understand; however, the existing valves will continue to work, right?

[20:26:52] <Nasp> the startup class is much easier to use
[20:27:12] <DevJohnC> meh
[20:27:25] <DevJohnC> in a controller you can inject your dependencies in the constructor
[20:27:38] <DevJohnC> or in the action handler
[20:27:42] <Shariff> Do you know of any example of that?
[20:27:54] <Nasp> Just write a constructor and use it
[20:28:02] <DevJohnC> it doesn't require an example... you just add it as a parameter to your constructor
[20:28:14] <DevJohnC> in action handler methods you need the [FromServices] attribute
[20:28:35] <Shariff> I appreciate the tip.. I have no idea what to put in the constructor, because the example I have uses EndpointRouteBuilder methods
[20:28:49] <DevJohnC> like: [HttpGet] public ActionResult<Thing>([FromServices] MyDep dep) { return Ok(dep.GetThing()); }
[20:28:50] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Do you mean actionfilters?
[20:28:57] <Nasp> Ahh actions in that way
[20:29:01] <DevJohnC> err, that needs a method name
[20:29:11] <DevJohnC> like: [HttpGet] public ActionResult<Thing> GetThing([FromServices] MyDep dep) { return Ok(dep.GetThing()); }
[20:29:17] <Nasp> Not sure i like the in the action itself
[20:29:19] <Nasp> Seems so messy
[20:29:50] <DevJohnC> depends on the scenario
[20:30:12] <Nasp> Sure, but then if you also have a model or some parameters
[20:30:26] <DevJohnC> if some of my actions need an extra service, but not all, I might inject them in the action to avoid taking an unneeded dependency on every request the controller handles
[20:30:37] <DevJohnC> and can make testing easier
[20:30:45] <Shariff> DevJohnC: And that would go in the controller with a helper function that gets a thing .. which you then call in the url functions (index for example)?
[20:32:16] <DevJohnC> I finally installed WSL, this is spooky
[20:32:51] <xb0o2> Shariff: in that example, GetThing *is* the method on the controller (what I believe you're calling a 'url function')
[20:32:51] <Nasp> First now
[20:32:54] <Nasp> It's really nice
[20:33:09] <Shariff> Ah, Ok.. thanks!
[20:33:29] <Shariff> Btw.. is there a better name for such a function then "url function"?
[20:33:38] <Nasp> It's an action
[20:33:42] <xb0o2> Err, controller methods or actions
[20:33:43] <Nasp> Controller action
[20:33:55] <Shariff> Thanks! Will call it that in the future
[20:34:29] <xb0o2> The actual name you give the method is for the most part irrelevant, it's the routing, supported methods, parameters etc. that matter
[20:34:43] * Shariff nods
[20:34:44] <Shariff> Thanks!
[20:35:49] <DevJohnC> method names are never irrelevant
[20:35:56] <DevJohnC> they should document what the method does
[20:36:29] <DevJohnC> they just don't have an effect on routing
[20:36:49] <Nasp> Depending on the routing strategy
[20:40:22] <Nasp> I can never figure out if it's best to name them what they do or do the Get Post Put strategy
[20:40:44] <DevJohnC> I name them for what they do, such that it makes sense in a unit test
[20:41:04] <DevJohnC> and I create a route that usually gels with the RESTful approach
[20:41:16] <xb0o2> <-- get/post/put strategy
[20:41:58] <Nasp> Is there a defualt option for that in core now actually
[20:42:05] <Nasp> It used to be the default in web api as i remember
[20:42:49] <xb0o2> Err, to clarify, you mean naming things like `FooController.GetAsync`, `BarController.DeleteAsync` yeah?
[20:43:47] <Nasp> Just get is fine
[20:43:56] *** Quits: alguien_ (~alguien@user/alguien) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:44:20] <xb0o2> Then yeah, we follow that strategy.
[20:44:51] <Nasp> But do you annotate each endpoint or have it picked up by the name of the method
[20:45:00] <DevJohnC> I dislike that it doesn't describe what you're getting - if your RESTful resource collection has sub-resources that don't demand their own controller you're losing specificity by being vague

[20:47:15] <DevJohnC> in the case of a collection controller I might write a `GetAll` method or `GetAllFiltered` if it takes filter arguments, etc.

[20:47:38] <Nasp> ahh
[20:47:43] <Nasp> Yeah i agree
[20:47:56] <Nasp> But i sometimes kinda hate when you annotate it with GetAllProducts through an entire products controller
[20:48:08] <Nasp> I find that people tend to shove waaay to much into a controller
[20:48:25] <DevJohnC> usually I won't do that, it's repetative - if your collection already names it's type that's enough for me
[20:48:39] <Nasp> Yeah i wonder what the products controller deletes
[20:48:44] <DevJohnC> though I'll add that type of qualifier if I'm accessing a sub-member of some sort
[20:48:55] <Nasp> But shouldn't that preferably be a new controller?

[20:49:00] <DevJohnC> depends
[20:49:20] <DevJohnC> if you only need one action method to support it (ie, only GET) it seems silly to create a whole controller for it
[20:49:25] <bambams> Anybody know of a weak pointer type of reference in .NET? A way to refer to an object without the garbage collector caring? And a way to check if it exists before accessing it?

[20:49:55] <jonp> bambams: WeakReference<T>?
[20:50:05] <DevJohnC> it follows the same rules you'd use to decide SRP - if the controller grows too big then you should evaluate if it's doing too much and refactor as needed

[21:00:33] <DevJohnC> looking at you Xcode toolchain
[21:00:40] <MatthiasVance> :D
[21:01:01] <MatthiasVance> I mean I am doing this in a templated way because I'm not sure how to do it yet, but I only run into issues :D
[21:01:05] <ravindUwU> If I wanted to add some logic that reaches out to a database or Redis cache to validate JWT bearer tokens, where's this supposed to go? 🤔
[21:01:11] <ravindUwU> I guess one way to do it would be in the `JwtBearerOptions.Events.OnMessageReceived`, but it doesn't feel right
[21:01:32] <Nasp> Sounds about right
[21:01:44] <DevJohnC> I'd add them to my authorization handlers
[21:01:44] <Nasp> Also is this because you want to be able to invalidate jwts?
[21:01:56] <DevJohnC> or authentication handler?
[21:02:03] <DevJohnC> I forget the terminology for which is which
[21:02:07] <ravindUwU> Nasp, yeah token revocation too
[21:02:38] <DevJohnC> basically a policy requirement that the token is still active
[21:02:41] <ravindUwU> DevJohnC, "authorisation handlers" (sorry; noob here)?
[21:02:47] <Nasp> Also i think i would rather use an in memory cache for that
[21:03:22] <Nasp> I dont like needing to validate a token again
[21:03:24] <DevJohnC> Nasp, cache invalidation will be a hard to debug point of failure though heh
[21:04:03] <Nasp> Not that hard
[21:04:15] <Nasp> Also isn't redis a cache as well
[21:04:31] <DevJohnC> I use JWT tokens to specify a session id and use a policy requirement to verify that the session id is still valid, so that users can log out of devices from their dashboard
[21:04:48] <Nasp> But isn't the point of JWTs thatr you sohuld'nt need to look up in a database
[21:04:50] <Nasp> Same with sessions
[21:04:56] <DevJohnC> not really
[21:05:19] <DevJohnC> the point of JWTs is to exchange data you can validate the origin of
[21:05:22] <Nasp> We call a http service to verify it and i hate it
[21:06:05] <ravindUwU> Nasp, I was thinking of including a JWT ID (there's some standard JWT claim) to identify it
[21:06:08] <ravindUwU> jti I think
[21:06:33] <Nasp> Also do you have a list of valid sessions or invalid sessions?
[21:07:11] <MatthiasVance> Oh wtf they require you to sign in to VS using the same account you use in Azure AD
[21:07:29] <MatthiasVance> "Please sign-in to Visual Studio with this account:"
[21:07:32] <MatthiasVance> Hell no
[21:08:15] <Nasp> I think a requirement might be easier for the jwt check
[21:08:53] <ravindUwU> So I guess I can roll my own `JwtBearerHandler`-equivalent (which is the authentication handler for JwtBearer)
[21:09:18] <Nasp> Requirements are really nice to work with
[21:09:25] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  How do you do session invalidation?
[21:09:25] <DevJohnC> the main point of JWT was to be able to give the token to any client-side app and know it came from a trusted authority, not that the session it represents is currently valid
[21:10:24] <DevJohnC> Nasp, the valid date range included in the token and the token id being revoked
[21:11:07] <Nasp> So you dont
[21:11:24] <DevJohnC> maybe I don't understand what you're asking
[21:11:41] <Nasp> Invalidation is when you take an existing JWT and invalidate it
[21:11:45] <Nasp> One you've given to a client
[21:12:00] <Nasp> It's still valid, except someone revoked it
[21:12:10] <DevJohnC> yeah, we deactivated in a database
[21:12:19] <DevJohnC> we deactivate it* in a database
[21:12:41] <Nasp> Thought you meant valid date range in the jwt
[21:12:50] <Nasp> That oyu just checked the exp field
[21:13:14] <DevJohnC> that largely controls when to renew the token silently
[21:13:29] <DevJohnC> but, of course, if we receive a token that's not in the valid date range we don't honor it
[21:13:44] <Nasp> I just dont like that extra lookup since ours is done in another service
[21:14:03] <DevJohnC> I don't see why it's a problem
[21:14:11] <Nasp> Extra latency
[21:14:20] <Nasp> And especially for framework it's an issue
[21:15:01] <DevJohnC> if the latency is causing your app issues there are ways around it, but they require more engineering and can increase your points of failure
[21:15:14] <Nasp> And if that invalidation service is down then northing works
[21:15:18] <DevJohnC> I tend not to be too concerned about latency unless it's a measurable problem in my app
[21:15:38] <DevJohnC> well, yeah
[21:15:46] <DevJohnC> but that's like saying if your database is down then nothing works
[21:15:58] <Nasp> separate database
[21:16:04] <DevJohnC> if any mission critical service breaks then your app breaks
[21:16:22] <Nasp> Worst part is this functionality was added so we check each session, but those that should make the invalidation feature haven't made it
[21:16:28] <Nasp> So it's really just wated :D
[21:16:29] <Nasp> wasted
[21:18:24] <Nasp> Anyways my idea was to have an in memory cache of revoked sessions and update that every 1 minute
[21:18:31] <ravindUwU> DevJohnC, Nasp, thanks ^^
[21:18:31] <Nasp> Should be a bit better
[21:19:05] <Nasp> What solution did you go with?
[21:19:16] <DevJohnC> Nasp, and if you notice a session that you didn't authorize (as a user) and need to revoke access immediately an attacker could still have a minute of full access to prevent their invalidation
[21:19:20] <DevJohnC> or cause more damage
[21:19:30] <Nasp> But is a full minute really an issue
[21:19:47] <Nasp> Then lets say 10 seconds
[21:19:48] <DevJohnC> of course it is
[21:20:00] <Nasp> Revocation can't always be imediatly
[21:20:14] <DevJohnC> how many requests can an application make to an app, if it's written in advance, in those 10 seconds?
[21:20:28] <Nasp> Depends on the rate limit
[21:20:42] <DevJohnC> revocation should be within tolerance of rate limits
[21:20:42] <Nasp> But how often do you know your token has been misused
[21:20:51] <Nasp> And you need invalidation now because in the next 10 seconds shit will break
[21:21:01] <Nasp> I would say a minute is fine
[21:21:11] <Nasp> Could do it faster, or listen to events so it's "almost" imediatly
[21:21:38] <DevJohnC> if you want to keep a list of revoked/valid sessions in memory because a trip to the server is that problematic for you I'd use an event bus
[21:21:55] <DevJohnC> but that seems like adding complexity for very little gain
[21:22:36] <Nasp> Thats what i said with events
[21:22:59] <Nasp> The trip to the server is mostly problematic because i find it to be a lot of requests just to verify something that in 99.99999% is valid
[21:23:06] <Nasp> Or if ever invalid due to the feature not really working to begin with
[21:23:13] <Nasp> We already have event bus
[21:23:38] <DevJohnC> does it have a measurable impact on the perf. of your app?
[21:23:57] <Nasp> Yes
[21:24:10] <Nasp> It spawns a task and create a http request for each http request
[21:24:17] <Nasp> Core probably wouldn't care as much
[21:24:28] <Nasp> But i still find it wasteful to add 1-5ms
[21:24:54] <DevJohnC> I don't think that should be much of an issue, but if it is for you then so be it
[21:25:32] <Nasp> Well we'll se when i've rewritten this to core

[23:43:46] <tlf> now I can see in the db that the field is in fact empty, however if I try and if(item != null) {foo}, I get foo

[23:46:01] <jonp> tlf: i was thinking "on what line is the NullReferenceException thrown"
[23:46:08] <jonp> i don't see how (now) line 10 can throw
[23:46:22] <jonp> or how to hit line 12 w/ DBFilePaths==null
[23:46:40] <tlf> dbfilepaths would either return a concated string, or null
[23:46:45] <jonp> now, line 2 or 3 could throw, if `item` itself is null
[23:47:12] <jonp> or if `Holder` is null on line 3
[23:47:17] <MatthiasVance> Why does everyone do either B2C or B2B but not both :D You either get social logins or you get AD/SAML/LDAP
[23:48:18] <jonp> tlf: unrelated: string compares are case-sensitive in C#, so `DBFilePaths != "n/a"` won't match for `"N/A"`
[23:48:54] <jonp> this is where the *entire* stack trace of the NullReferenceException would be handy…
[23:49:10] <jonp> to see if it's actually in ReturnFilePaths(), and/or *where* in ReturnFilePaths()
[23:49:28] <tlf> jonp, in this instance I have a separate function where files are uploaded and the paths saved. if there are no files uploaded then the default submission to the db should be "n/a"
[23:49:42] <tlf> I didn't put much thought into whether that was a good idea, if theres a better one please let me know
[23:49:55] <tlf> I found the issue, I never declared holder
[23:50:11] <jonp> so line 3 was the throw site
[23:50:32] <tlf> yeah
[23:50:41] <canton7> I did ask that specific question, and confirmed whether it was definitely the 'if' line which was throwing...
[23:51:04] <canton7> Also don't concat strings in a loop. Use a StringBuilder
[23:51:24] <tlf> I discovered stringbuilder later on in this project
