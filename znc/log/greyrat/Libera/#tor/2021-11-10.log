[22:50:54] <iShareFreedom> Hello hackers
[22:51:18] <iShareFreedom> i want use Tox, via Tor, the port is 9050 right? 
[22:52:51] <xx> tor will be running on 9050 by default, or 9150 if using torbrowser
[22:53:18] <xx> assuming you're talking about the socksports
[22:54:08] <iShareFreedom> yes
[22:54:43] <xx> also, even though tox looks good, it really hasn't seen much development in years and has known vulnerabilities that cannot currently be fixed because none of the current devs understand that part of the codebase
[22:54:59] <xx> so preferably use something else if your life depends on it
[22:56:53] <iShareFreedom> what you recommend
[22:57:04] <iShareFreedom> i want something good for speaking with my family and friends
[22:57:37] <xx> sadly there isn't any communication tool right now that *I* would be happy to recommend currently
[22:57:49] <xx> I should create one myself probably
[22:58:36] <iShareFreedom> i want try xmpp, matrix etc but i dont know a good server for put me on for the free speach etc
[23:00:19] <iShareFreedom> xx bte im using qTox, is a new client maybe they still working on it see in tox.chat web
[23:00:49] <xx> they are making git commits from time to time, but it's minor things like documentation updates
[23:01:02] <xx> also, both #qtox and #tox are channels on libera
[23:02:16] <xx> xmpp is in a weird spot too, it doesn't have mandatory always-on encryption, all current encryption methods can be accidentally disabled (or don't come enabled by default), and lots of metadata is stored on servers (such as the whole contact list), so it should only be used if you're the one in control of the server
[23:07:59] <iShareFreedom> the IRC servers are good for comunication, for security right? servers like OFTC with SSL and TLS
[23:08:34] <xx> yeah, but sadly it's easy for a newbie user to connect without TLS because it is not enforced
[23:08:35] <iShareFreedom> But, for example, my mom have problems with his hands, and she prefer send voice messages, and IRC dont support it very well or easy for newbies
