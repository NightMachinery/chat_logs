[03:53:14] <tomreyn> it's mostly an ecosystem - and who uses it - problem. the fact that we now need to introduce AV scanning equivalents to linux because "oh i just used this docker image i found online, works well!" is not the direction i was hoping to go

[04:09:20] <Deknos> well, tbh, i also often wondered, why we start scanning docker images, but never repository mirrors. i mean we all mirror repositories of our linux distributions, so in case they are offline? do we? yes? :D
[04:09:44] <Deknos> i mean, why shouldn't there be malware in a rpm or deb package?
[04:10:06] <ajak> you really have to trust your distribution
[04:10:16] <Deknos> it's not like there aren't dozen launchpad repos or epels out there which are added to some systems...
[04:10:33] <Deknos> you have to trust your install. but for updates, you still can scan...
[04:10:35] <ajak> well if you don't trust those then yeah you should be vetting it somehow
[04:11:01] <Deknos> or, like.. vagrant boxes
[04:11:22] <Deknos> but because of some bitcoin miners in k8s systems everybody is out and about

[08:11:49] <ns12> nudge: Some guided missiles target the sources of various kinds of radiation (e.g. infrared, radar, radio, etc.). One way to defend against such guided missiles is to electronic countermeasures to fool the missile (e.g. masking the source of the radiation so that the source cannot be targeted). That is one way.

[10:29:04] <ns12> Given the same amount of effort put into a piece of software, is closed-source software more secure than open-source software? With closed-source software, hackers do not have access to the source code, which makes it more difficult to find vulnerabilities.
[10:31:43] <Seirdy> ns12: all other things being equal, it is much better to have source code.
[10:32:01] <Seirdy> ns12: this does not mean that proprietary software is less secure than open source software.

[10:32:35] <Seirdy> it means that open source software has an advantage. despite this, plenty of proprietary software is far more secure than open source counterparts.
[10:33:04] <Seirdy> this is partly bc big companies can afford to through ridiculous amounts of money the best security researchers
[10:33:16] <ns12> Seirdy: "it is much better to have source code" - Why? I don't think software should be open source, but merely "source available" so that they can be audited by trusted third-parties (rather than malicious hackers).

[10:34:04] <zdctg[m]> imho, the difference between a widely used/deployed OSS program and closed source is that closed source tends to go through reviews as part of the development process and so a lot of trite bugs are fixed pre-release. Thus, it takes a little time before the OSS software "catches up" and has those same sort of bugs fixed. There are variances of course, some companies put nothing into security and there is no pre-release review process, others
[10:34:04] <zdctg[m]> explicitly design their software and have extensive review processes even before the first line of code is written. Inversely, some OSS software is very competently written and will have virtually no bugs in it at first release.
[10:34:07] <Seirdy> ns12: i described in the post how source code lets you patch software without waiting on the vendor to do it
[10:34:36] <zdctg[m]> As for whether it matters a whole lot whether the source code is available or not, generally speaking-- not so much, there are plenty of reverse engineers to go around.
[10:35:17] <Seirdy> i wrote two previous articles in support of FLOSS, and neither one focused on security because i don't think that's particularly high on the list of reasons.
[10:35:47] <Seirdy> this one is kinda to add some nuance because way too many fossbros have started following me while supporting me for the wrong reasons.

[11:19:30] <Seirdy> cuz people brought that up when reading earlier drafts.
[11:20:20] <Seirdy> zdctg[m]: yep, and that's before you get into certain kinds of obfuscation
[11:20:44] <Seirdy> apparently some games run in a VM with its own instruction set just to hamper analysis. which is why cracked games often get better framerates.

[11:22:36] <Seirdy> nudge: you are absolutely qualified to offer feedback. feedback doesn't have to be technical ;)
[11:22:43] <Seirdy> no obligations though
[11:23:48] <zdctg[m]> Seirdy: Well, generally when they use VM in that context it doesn't mean the same as like VMWare or anything that makes use of the VMX instructions but rather that the binary runs in sort of an interpreter, so instead of like the "add" instruction being executed by the CPU there is an "add" instruction for an interpreter that translates it to a CPU instruction-- base point being that "VM" in that context is closer to interpreter (as in
[11:23:48] <zdctg[m]> python, perl, whatever) than VM as in VMX

[11:26:55] *** Joins: sp3nc3r (~sp3nc3r@user/sp3nc3r)
[11:27:54] <Seirdy> it's more than a simple interpreter; it has an instruction set that gets JITed into cpu instructions. it's kind of like one of those WASM VMs that's been floating around.
[11:28:27] <Seirdy> and the names of those instructions are jibberish, produced by whatever they use for obfuscation

[11:34:31] <zdctg[m]> seirday: your point is still valid, but intel ME/AMT entails some very special aspects. It's actually another computer inside of the computer and its memory and such in inaccessible to the host CPU/etc. There are hardware delimited problems, for instance, in some areas the bus operates at a speed high enough that in order to be able to afford equipment that can sniff it you have to have a very big budget. Additionally, and I'm bound to some
[11:34:31] <zdctg[m]> extent by NDA here, but at the point where reverse engineering becomes problematic (listed as the custom huffman coding tables) there is a proprietary CPU whose instruction set is non-public, so to reverse engineer it you're fairly literally talking about the same process as reversing a processor and it entails basically having the same capabilities as like AMD-- your point is still valid and as a lot of the work shows a lot can still be
[11:34:31] <zdctg[m]> reversed in software, but reversing the other parts is basically totally beyond the capability of anyone that isn't a giant corporation or government

[11:35:36] <zdctg[m]> zdctg[m]: just as a point of order, and I haven't worked on it in >10 years, but at least at one point the ME could do basically anything on the host system, although all of that functionality grew out of AMT
[11:36:12] <Seirdy> yeah, understanding the workings of the obfuscated parts is crazy hard but we can sorta figure out their scope.
[11:36:43] <Affliction> of course, there are dozens of microcontrollers in a modern computer, which may or may not have DMA capability
[11:36:48] <Seirdy> at one point wasn't MINIX the world's most popular OS just bc of Intel ME?
[11:38:01] <zdctg[m]> Seirdy: well the fact that despite a lot of reverse engineering effort no one has even noticed the proprietary CPU tells you just how difficult it is; I can't recall what aspect of things the unencrypted bus traffic related to, but that no one has gotten to it also underscores the difficulty.
[11:38:44] <Seirdy> hmm...i'll prob update that when I wake up
[11:39:36] <zdctg[m]> Seirdy: Probably, I'm not sure-- I don't even know for certain that Minix was used in it although per my understanding it does; I worked as part of a team that was tasked with trying to break it and Intel hired like a dozen different consultancies to try to do it and AFAIK no one did even with explicit special access. There were some complications with unsigned firmware and being able to rollback due to regression bugs, but AFAIK all of
[11:39:36] <zdctg[m]> that was basically solved before the product really hit the market
[11:39:37] * Seirdy tee's the `tail -n200` of this chatlog to his "todo" directory.
[11:41:05] <zdctg[m]> Seirdy: Well I probably should have not said anything, but my preference is to not mention the hardware specific stuff that I know due to having worked on it; I don't think Intel would care and it's not violating the NDA but still probably stuff I should mostly keep to myself
[11:42:57] <zdctg[m]> your overall point is valid/correct; source code makes a lot of things easier, but its absence doesn't make it impossible and even in the most extreme of circumstances, e.g. ME/AMT, its still possible its just more difficult or requires specialised equipment that is sometimes outside the price point of the hobbyist
[11:43:03] <Seirdy> zdctg[m]: the only edit i think i'll make is clarifying that when it comes to obfuscated bits, the reveng is limited to understanding potential capabilities of components rather than inner workings, and that it blurs the line between regular software reveng and actually figuring out how the processor is made, which is wrapped up in trade secrets.
