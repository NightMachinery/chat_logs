[19:41:03] <_shana> Hello, https://regex101.com/r/ypEuro/1 - platform ECMAScript, I have no idea why comma is being matched in last row ( query matches paths including comma in them but doesn't match comma between paths)
[19:45:28] <karhunkynsi> Looks like issue is with .*
[19:47:38] <_shana> Well I don't know how else I'm going to match path that has comma inbetween { } so I'm currently using tempered greedy token
[19:48:47] <karhunkynsi> Most immediate fix is to remove the . so the * quantifies the group instead.
[19:49:38] <karhunkynsi> But since it just checks that there's no } you can rewrite that part to [^}]*
[19:51:36] <_shana> Wow that almost works
[19:52:08] <karhunkynsi> Yeah, so remaining issue are lines with multiple {}
[19:52:34] <karhunkynsi> *are parts with
[19:54:22] <_shana> yeah, in progress of figuring that out, maybe the easies solution would be to match one or more for matched everything encolsed in { }
[19:55:31] <karhunkynsi> Yes.
[19:57:19] <_shana> ok so I found that it's not working like that since tempered greedy token matchess too much therefore match one or more will work after fixing that first, I'll get back to you if I can't figure that out. Thanks for giving me tips :)
[19:57:42] <karhunkynsi> Sure, happy to help :)
[20:01:26] <_shana> Unless you have better idea to just match commas between paths? :P
[20:06:50] <karhunkynsi> How about this?  https://regex101.com/r/ypEuro/2

[20:12:19] <karhunkynsi> Based on your data, if you have {}/folder/{} it won't work.
[20:17:25] <_shana> Yeah I see what you mean, that shouldn't happen in current codebase. In the end figured that matching just commas between paths and then splitting on matched character will make it easier to work with paths later on

[21:11:55] <purplex> what do you mean 'checking'?
[21:12:32] <re101-eagle-59> I mean when there is a String with comma seperated values in it, looking for a regex to validate
[21:14:18] <purplex> so check if there's a comma in the string? or, are there 'values' which needs checking..
[21:14:19] <re101-eagle-59> example "Hero is a Hero, Zero is a Zero with 2Numbers for 32"
[21:17:43] <purplex> appears to be simple as this: ^(?=.*,)
