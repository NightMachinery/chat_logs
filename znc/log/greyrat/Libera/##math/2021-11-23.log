[05:19:38] <trombel> this is way beyond my understanding
[05:20:31] <Guest23> Ah
[05:20:56] <Guest23> Then it should be (20!)/(2!*18!)
[05:21:18] <Guest23> i.e 190
[05:21:40] <Z-module> The number of 2-element subsets out of a set of 40 things is C(40,2) = 40*39/2. Is that what you meant?
[05:22:06] * trombel scratches head
[05:23:25] <Guest23> Ah i thought you had 20 typefaces
[05:23:26] <trombel> lets say you have 40 different colored jellos, i want to pair only 2 different colored jellos at a time, how many comabinations do you get?
[05:23:36] <Z-module> same thing:  40*39/2
[05:23:40] <Guest23> Yep
[05:23:55] <Z-module> i.e. 780
[05:24:01] <trombel> so is that 40 x 19.5?
[05:24:15] <Z-module> better to call it 20*39, but yes
[05:24:31] <trombel> gotcha
[05:25:08] <Z-module> In other words, the # of ordered pairs (choice1, choice2) is 40*39,  since you want them to be different, but then divide that by 2 since you don't care about the order.
[05:26:20] *** Quits: tomg (~tomg@user/tomg) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[05:31:33] <Z-module> In general, when you have some set X of n things, the total # of distinct k-element subsets of X (where k is any of 0, 1, ..., n) is C(n,k) = (n - 0)(n - 1)*...*(n - (k - 1)) / k! , which = the # of distinct (n - k)-element subsets of X.

[05:34:41] <trombel> then taking then taking the last example it would be 4*3/3?

[05:36:21] <Z-module> the # of 3-element subsets of a 4-element set is 4*3*2/3! = 4
[05:36:46] <Z-module> again, that's clear because each such subset is uniquely identified by which of the 4 colors it omits
[05:37:25] <Z-module> the # of 3-element subsets of an n-element set is  n(n - 1)(n - 2)/6    (6 is 3!)
[05:37:51] <trombel> 4*3*2/3! = 4 <- this should give 8 no?
[05:38:01] <trombel> 12*2/3?
[05:38:02] <Z-module> no:  3! = 3*2*1
[05:38:22] <Z-module> that 3! down there just cancels the  3*2 from up top

[05:39:32] *** Joins: MizMahem (sid296354@user/mizmahem)
[05:40:06] <Z-module> If the four colors are A,B,C,D, then all the distinct 3-element subsets are:  {A,B,C}, {A,B,D}, {A,C,D}, {B,C,D}.  That's all.
[05:40:07] <trombel> the 3 down there in 2/x cancels out with the 4x3 no?
[05:40:15] <trombel> the 3 down there in 2/3 cancels out with the 4x3 no?
[05:41:28] <Z-module> you didn't need to even multiply anything:   4 * 3 * 2 / 3! = (4 * 3 * 2)/(3 * 2) =  4 * [ (3 * 2)/(3 * 2) ] = 4
[05:45:18] <MizMahem> okay I know this is getting into deep waters but is there like a "minimal" prime gap pattern that repeats? IE after x primes while the number of the next prime isn't known, is it known that the next prime is at least 2, 4, 6, whatever numbers appart in a repeating pattern?

[06:12:43] <PlanckWalk> (Writing it in terms of 6n instead of 2n gives the game away)
[06:13:12] <MizMahem> my use case. I'm writing a method to decompose an arbitrary number, which (AFAIK) requires testing the modulus with all the prime numbers up to `sqrt(number)`. I've got like the first 25 primes seeded into my method, but beyond that I'm currently testing manually against all the odd numbers. If possible I'd like to improve that, you know testing with `lastSeededPrime + minimalGap`.

[06:19:43] <PlanckWalk> You can use a repeating pattern after multiples of 30
[06:19:56] <PlanckWalk> But the benefit to doing so is pretty low
[06:20:17] <PlanckWalk> Especially compared with using a better factorization algorithm

[11:45:36] <W> Are there any useful identities for the error function, especially in terms of sums of multiple error functions? e.g. If I have an integral I strongly suspect is solvable without the error function, but keep bumping into it with different approaches, is it unlikely I will be unable to eliminate it? I checked the Wikipedia page which didn't have anything apparent beyond the obvious properties from definition and its nature as an odd function

[11:47:44] <W> (if I'm wrong about it being solvable without it, I'll dump this problem and move on to another similar one)
[11:49:13] <HisShadow> if it is an indefinite integral and you can transform it into erf function then it is indeed not expressible in terms of elementary functions, but if it is a definite one, there might be a trick to solve it with the bounds you are given

[11:51:47] <HisShadow> W: like integral from 0 to infinity e^(-x^2) dx is sqrt(pi)/2
[11:54:39] <HisShadow> W: you do it by considering (integral from 0 to a e^(-x^2) dx) * (integral from 0 to a e^(-y^2) dy) = integral from 0 to a integral from 0 to a e^(-x^2 - y^2) dxdy which equals to the double integral of that over the square [0,a] x [0,a] and then you do a polar substitution, then take a->infinity. Or something like that.

[18:30:14] <cherim> It's also easy to explain why "no more guests (with number of guests of cardinality > |N|) can be accomodated" has nothing to do with what Hilbert meant -- he introduces cardinalities above |N| only after the last mention of the Hotel end in "Lectures on the Foundations of Arithmetic and Logic"
[18:30:47] <cherim> He only uses "kein Zimmer frei", no room unoccupied. Probably this becomes "full" in English.

[19:55:42] <Z-module> SUM 1/n^2  is a positive real (happens to be pi^2/6 but that's not too relevant), so if most terms b_n are positive, and b_n <= 1/n^2 for all n, then for all sufficiently large n, the sequence of partial finite sums  S_n = (b_1 +...+ b_n)   is purely increasing and S_n <= pi^2/6 for all n, so  lim_n S_n  must be finite (and whatever limit this is, that is  SUM b_n ).  But if infinitely many b_n terms are negative, those partial sums
[19:55:42] <Z-module> S_n  might bounce up and down forever, or get infinitely negative, so you can't conclude any limit behavior just from  S_n <= pi^2/6  for all n.

[20:04:23] <Guest95> trying to see if I can use the Alternating Series test
[20:04:48] <Z-module> this one turns out to be absolutely convergent, which you should try to show
[20:05:27] <Z-module> wait, does it?
[20:05:27] <Guest95> that means the abs-value of that series turns out to be convergent, right?
[20:05:57] <Z-module> yeah, does
[20:06:02] <Z-module> right on your question there
[20:06:11] <Z-module> so that implise the original series converges too

[20:09:29] <Z-module> one way is to show that   n^3 < 2^n   for all n >= 10
[20:10:02] <Z-module> so you have a finite error along with comparison to  SUM_n (2/3)^n
[20:10:11] <Z-module> (and, again, positive terms)
[20:10:14] <Guest95> ah cool
[20:10:47] <Guest95> We could do Ratio Test too right? a_(n+1) / a_n = 1/3 * (n+1)^3 / n^3, and the limit of the absolute value of that is 1/3

[20:44:26] <twJizhan> hi, this problem, asking the best strategy for player 1st of totally 2 players, is written partly ambiguously in Chinese in a post, now I try to fix it to be precise and be in English.
[20:44:30] <twJizhan> there is a poker desk of 52 cards. player 1st and 2nd each draw 5 cards blindedly. 1st round, player 1st must discard 1 card and draw 1 new card blindedly, and then player 2nd do the same. after 5 rounds, stop, and compare the hands of 2 players according to the common poker rules to decide who wins.
[20:45:15] <twJizhan> what is the best strategy of player 1st ?

[21:47:35] <mathe8787> To the Members of the Graduate Admissions Committee,
[21:47:35] <mathe8787> I am writing in support of XXX and his desire to attend your PhD program. X has taken my two courses, X and Y, and earned perfect grades, presented a seminal paper in my XX Seminar at the XX, and I am his internal evaluator for his master’s thesis.
[21:47:37] <mathe8787> X has shown very strong interest in the field of XXX. He has stellar grades in this specialization and has also dedicated his time in obtaining experimental skills which are vital to the success of a PhD student. He has shown to be very proactive as he has reached out to many researchers in this field and he is currently doing his master’s thesis in X that focuses on this specialization.
[21:47:42] <mathe8787> It is rare in XXX(country) for students to have as much research experience as X has had during his bachelors and masters. His ability to simultaneously fulfill coursework obligations and work as a research assistant is quite impressive. He will come well prepared into your PhD program as he carries the specialized knowledge in XX and the experimental experience. I firmly believe that X is going to be a very capable and qualified PhD
[21:47:47] <mathe8787> candidate and the lab that chooses him will substantially profit from his arsenal of technical skills.
[21:47:49] <mathe8787> I thus recommend X without reservation for the admission into your graduate program. I am sure you will find X to be a highly motivated, competent and committed student who will grow into a successful professional in this field. Please feel free to contact me if you require further information.

[23:06:42] <cherim> Z-module: Sum 1/n^(2 + sin(n)) should probably diverge just by Birkhoff ergodicity and the fact that Riemann zeta has a simple pole at 1, and is not dependent on the hard stuff like irrationality measure of pi (cf. Flint Hills series)?

[23:24:02] <irrgit> Hello, my math sucks. Ok now thats out of the way. How would I phrase a problem where there are two competing entities, each growing at a different rate. What I want to be able to find out is after how long (years) will one overtake the other. This is not taking into account another set of  j,k variables, where as x grows by 67%, j which is directly related to x grows by  33% and k grows by 16% . -> http://mathb.in/67789
[23:25:35] <irrgit> *I blame my ti-84 silver edition for my total lack of knowledge.  Installing programs to solve things for me clearly didnt do me any good.
