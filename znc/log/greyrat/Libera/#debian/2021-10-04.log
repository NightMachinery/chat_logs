[00:00:58] <nr0q_radio> so I found the debian-packaging channel on OFTC but doesn't look like there's any life there, any other good places to go for specific help with packaging?
[00:01:30] <jelly> it's just #packaging
[00:01:54] <nr0q_radio> ah thanks, that makes a differnce :D
[00:02:32] <tjcarter> After all, Debian packaging is the only kind that matters.
[00:02:34] <jelly> if you plan to become a debian maintainer and developer and upload your packages into debian, you may also ask in #debian-mentors (also on OFTC)
[00:02:44] <nr0q_radio> well umm lol ok
[00:03:03] <nr0q_radio> I do plan to, and I'll check that one out too
[00:03:04] <jelly> tjcarter, #packaging is for general packaging questions
[00:03:17] <nr0q_radio> well I'm packaging for all OSs that I can
[00:03:37] <tjcarter> nr0q_radio: that's probably what you want then
[00:03:44] <nr0q_radio> just seems that half the linux world is Debian, I live though on the other side
[00:03:58] <tjcarter> jelly: General Debian packaging questions? üòÅ
[00:04:04] <jelly> nr0q_radio, arch linux is nice yes
[00:04:25] <tjcarter> nr0q_radio: Probably half of Linux distributions are unfortunately Ubuntu-based.
[00:04:29] <somiaj> nr0q_radio: have you looked at the new maintainers guide?
[00:04:42] <jelly> !nmg
[00:04:42] <dpkg> The packaging tutorial (https://deb.li/QYyI) and the New Maintainer's Guide (https://deb.li/3DiDA) are good places to start learning about Debian packaging.  You should also ask me about <devref> and <policy> to understand how packages should be maintained and how they should interact with each other.  Ask me about <package basics>, <mentors>, <best practices> <build without helper>.  https://www.debian.org/devel/
[00:04:57] <nr0q_radio> I have several friends that use it, and thankfully someone else that's our Arch maintainer, I got stuck with Debian, MacOS, Windows, RHEL/Fedora and other
[00:05:40] <jelly> #packaging isn't too big either, patience is advised
[00:06:06] <tjcarter> nr0q_radio: fortunately, in very real terms, there's not much difference for the average program between various flavors of Unix. There's some differences when you need to package a daemon or massively complex suite of things ‚Ä¶
[00:06:06] <nr0q_radio> cool yup I've figured out that one package will have to be non-free simply because it's wonky build system, and the other being it depends on the first will be contrib, that's about as far as i've gotten
[00:06:52] <tjcarter> what're you packaging?

[00:10:08] <jelly> js and node have their own packaging detailses
[00:10:35] <tjcarter> could be worse
[00:11:17] <PMT> nw.js also has six degrees of suffering, it looks like, for building
[00:11:21] <tjcarter> node at least has fairly common ways of doing things. java OTOH ‚Ä¶ most people's jar projects seem to only build on their specific wintendo entertainment systems.
[00:11:28] <nr0q_radio> yeah, and then you mix chromium and glue in

[00:12:52] <nr0q_radio> I let nw.js build per their directions on my Ryzen 5 4GHz 80GB DDR4 machine here and 8 hours of suffering at 1200% CPU utilization later it died with ungooglable errors
[00:13:08] <jelly> mix chromium in.. what is that thing, something like electron?
[00:13:22] <nr0q_radio> it's a predecessor to electron
[00:13:39] <jelly> oh dear
[00:13:49] <nr0q_radio> we'd migrate if it weren't for that electron requires node and chrome contexts be seperated, our code is well it's what it is

[04:24:56] <chance2105> poet: Is it just Firefox? Other symptoms / what else is slow (specific examples is helpful). It's hard to troubleshoot based on a single thing. Firefox, for instance, better to start with a new profile and see what's up there.
[04:25:27] <nr0q_radio> what is your system usage with no userland apps running, just with a idle desktop and only your xterm/konsole
[04:26:09] <chance2105> On the other hand, it's the same version of Firefox in 10 and 11..
[04:27:29] <poet> chance2105: It was slow booting. With Debian 10, it took about 30 seconds to boot. With Debian 11, it takes at least two minutes. I use the simple login manager. That took a long time to load. Then I log into StumpWM, which is a very low-resource window manager. That took at least two minutes. (Normally 15-20 seconds)

Firefox is actually the exact same version, just compiled with different versions of things between oldstable and stable right now. I doubt that difference in performance is apparmor
[04:38:50] <chance2105> poet: It might be CPU throttling keeping things slow

[05:16:54] <linus> Is there much point to separating headers package from those for binary files?
[05:18:32] <starbreaker> linus: I think the rationale is that header files are mainly useful to developers, but not necessarily for other use cases.
[05:19:32] <linus> well but that is mostly more convenience vs few added kilobytes
[05:19:39] <nr0q_radio> and putting them in a separate package makes the binary package smaller, only pull down what you need that way
[05:19:59] <nr0q_radio> it adds up when your putting 3000 packages on a disc

[05:21:33] <poet> I think I figured out what it is. It's /usr/libexec/tracker-extract, which is apparently an indexing tool or something for Gnome.

[08:22:03] <zzo38> My project (Free Hero Mesh, which is a puzzle game engine) does meet DFSG rules. I am using Ubuntu and not Debian, although it should be possible to compile on Debian as well, and I intend it can be made available for any Linux distributions. Dependencies are SQLite 3.x and SDL 1.x, although I am unsure of the exact version numbers required.
[08:23:34] <zzo38> The source code repository is fossil, and a mirror is available. Currently there are no version numbers, although if someone will be able to make packages then I can add non-propagating tags with version numbers in order that all packages of it can use the same version numbers if this is desirable.

[16:45:40] <no_gravity> I have a question about scroll direction: When you move your fingers on your touchpad downwards, does the window content scroll up or down?
[16:47:22] <dvs> no_gravity: with Windows, that changes on me spontaneously.  With Debian, the contents scroll up the windows.
[16:48:05] <PMT> The behavior I _expect_ is like if I physically grabbed an object and tugged it downward - that is, acting like I pressed the up arrow.
[16:48:27] <PMT> But I usually don't use that functionality.
[16:48:42] <no_gravity> dvs: Which windows manager in Debian?
[16:49:05] <dvs> no_gravity: KDE Plasma
[16:49:08] <no_gravity> PMT: The up arrow scrolls the page up, right?
[16:50:33] <PMT> It moves toward the top of the page. (I'm not trying to be obtuse, but given that we're talking about moving your fingers down behaving like pressing an up arrow, and things from the top of the screen moving toward the bottom, "up" and "down" can be ambiguous.)
[16:51:07] <no_gravity> I am thinking about on which direction I should settle.
[16:51:12] <randall> no_gravity: IIRC in Windows and iOS it's the opposite thing. But I don't use touchpads if I can avoid it (thinkpad ftw).
[16:51:36] <no_gravity> I always used "fingers down move content up". But the trend seems to go to the opposite.
[16:51:49] <PMT> I avoided using my touchpad on my thinkpads for a generation or two because they had a bad habit of confusing my inputs sometimes, but on my latest one, it seems robust.

[18:20:52] <nr0q_radio> That's a perfect name for a backup system!
[18:23:06] <Khepra> indeed it is
[18:24:13] <Khepra> so borg backup... assimilates your data and when you need to restore, ur dun goof'd, and resistence is futile?  and even if you DO manage to restore, the data will contain flashbacks to previous states, especially files named Locutus? :))

[19:13:14] <jelly> shad, the OS inside the container is older and has an older database of device names.  Other than the names, it seems to see the same set of PCI devices.
[19:13:28] <Bushdog> howdy, is it possible to install SQL Server 2019 in Debian at all?
[19:13:51] <jelly> Bushdog, does microsoft support Debian as the underlying OS?
[19:14:02] <shad> jelly: i've just `apt install lspci` from an exec in the container. Is there a way to update the database you mention ?
[19:14:13] <Bushdog> good question jelly
[19:14:16] <jelly> shad, update-pciids
[19:14:47] <jelly> but that will download from internet and you might get a _newer_ pci.ids db than what's on the host
[19:14:53] *** Joins: extropiator (~extropiat@user/extropiator)
[19:15:10] <PerfDave> Bushdog: A quick Google suggests that you can fudge packages intended for Ubuntu onto Debian. But I don't know whether MS support that; #debian doesn't ;)
[19:15:12] <jelly> also, it overwrites a packaged file which is frowned upon

[19:16:01] <jelly> Bushdog, I mean maybe you can install it.  Do you really want to USE IT on an unsupported platform, anything goes wrong and you can't ask for help from anyone
[19:16:16] <shad> jelly: why should I not install lspci and update the pciids from the dockerfile ?
[19:16:16] <Bushdog> jelly,  I understand dude
[19:16:35] <jelly> shad, it's just some text.  Does not affect how things work.
[19:17:07] <Bushdog> it just cos I do not like windows products and I run PostgreSQL and MySQL in my Debian Stretch with no issues, so I figured if I can bring that SQL Server 2019 in Debian as well, I am home free ...
[19:17:44] <jelly> consider updating to debian 10 then 11
[19:17:56] <Bushdog> I do not need SSMS cos I can always utlize DBeaver instead anyway
[19:18:05] <jelly> stretch is 4+ years old
[19:18:20] <Bushdog> jelly,  dude, I have Debian 10 running as LAMP Stack anyway in one of my other servers
[19:18:41] <Bushdog> Stretch rocks anyway, no issue at all, Same with 10, no issue at all, Buster Rocks dude
