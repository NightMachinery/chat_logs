[02:00:14] <mefistofeles> vaguely, but yes

[02:20:26] <HuntsMan> we don't even need cars, that is a very US-centric view, we need more public transportation
[02:21:17] <mefistofeles> HuntsMan: that's also not true :) we need both
[02:21:26] <theseb> HuntsMan: yes but with self driving cars you can make public trans

[02:21:57] <theseb> there's your public trans
[02:22:00] <HuntsMan> theseb: there is already public transportation

[02:23:00] <HuntsMan> with trains the problem is greatly simplified
[02:23:21] <mefistofeles> yet trains are so limited, hence why many still use and need cars

[02:24:46] <mefistofeles> :P
[02:24:53] <HuntsMan> you can build a much larger train/tram network if you remove all cars
[02:25:13] <HuntsMan> mefistofeles: not really, its much more common in Europe
[02:25:19] <mefistofeles> there's a reason why housing in the outskirts (away from work and "everything") is always more affordable... and so correlated with the need of a car
[02:25:32] <mefistofeles> HuntsMan: I know, I've lived in Europe, but still
[02:25:50] <mefistofeles> already living in Europe is a privilege compared to the vast majority of the world population
[02:26:00] <theseb> i loved the TGV

[02:28:16] <mefistofeles> they wouldn't renew my contract because pandemic
[02:28:29] <HuntsMan> lol
[02:28:31] <mefistofeles> which actually makes it worse, if you think about it

[02:32:22] <HuntsMan> mefistofeles: how many years were you working here?
[02:32:28] <mefistofeles> almost 2
[02:32:56] <mefistofeles> but the first year was remotely
[02:33:11] <mefistofeles> so lets say 1
[02:33:24] <HuntsMan> after two years in a EU Blue Card you get more rights to stay here
[02:33:31] <HuntsMan> you get progressively more as you live more time here
[02:33:49] <HuntsMan> have you seen how that works in the US for migrants?
[02:34:45] <mefistofeles> yep, I get to apply for permanent residency from the very beginning
[02:34:53] <mefistofeles> but then it all depends on several variables
[02:35:01] <HuntsMan> and some random variables :P
[02:35:11] <HuntsMan> (in the US I mean)
[02:35:12] <mefistofeles> depending on your employer and education, yes
[02:35:22] <HuntsMan> and your country of birth (not even citizenship)
[02:35:24] <mefistofeles> you enter this lottery, which in my case, I think I won't
[02:36:01] <mefistofeles> I'm in the process of getting a promotion and then apply for it
[02:36:01] <HuntsMan> lottery... that is crazy
[02:36:10] <HuntsMan> you mean for a green card?
[02:36:12] <mefistofeles> yes
[02:36:25] <mefistofeles> once in the green card process you cannot change your position
[02:36:37] <HuntsMan> lol
[02:36:38] <mefistofeles> (well, unless you want to start it all over again, that is)
[02:36:45] <HuntsMan> don't you have to wait 5 years to apply for a green card?
[02:36:52] <mefistofeles> no, not really
[02:37:06] <mefistofeles> but I guess it depends on your legal status, mine is what they call "double intention"
[02:37:33] <mefistofeles> so my visa is kinda meant to be used for getting the green card
[02:37:40] <HuntsMan> which visa is that?
[02:37:49] <HuntsMan> H1B?
[02:38:03] <mefistofeles> I prefer not to say, but one that allow working here without much restrictions
[02:38:12] <HuntsMan> lol
[02:38:29] <mefistofeles> there are special working visa for some special countries as well, that's why I don't want to say :)
[02:38:44] <HuntsMan> for H1B you need to live for 5 years I think to apply for a green card, then you enter the random part of it
[02:38:50] <HuntsMan> sure, speaking of privilege ;)
[02:39:00] <mefistofeles> special can be bad as well

[02:42:44] <mefistofeles> I can see why for people without higher education can be a pain, though
[02:43:20] <mefistofeles> when I say better, just the permanent residency thing, btw
[02:44:01] <HuntsMan> in Germany you can get permanent residence after living for 2 years
[02:44:08] <HuntsMan> does not get better than that
[02:44:20] <HuntsMan> and you don't have to fill silly forms like in the US
[02:44:31] <HuntsMan> I did my PR application over email, and got accepted over email
[02:45:07] <HuntsMan> if you have the EU permanent residency, you can even transfer it across most Schengen countries
[02:46:06] <mefistofeles> that's nice, but yeah, even if I like Germany, how they treated me as a working non immigrant during a pandemic, is clearly not one of them
[02:46:32] <HuntsMan> sure but that can happen in any country, people also got the same treatment in the US
[02:46:35] <HuntsMan> its not particular to Germany
[02:46:53] <HuntsMan> I also had students being hired into full time jobs during 2020 at the height of the pandemic
[02:47:50] <mefistofeles> well, I guess... maybe I was lucky, because at the time I applied for many jobs (for obvious reasons), I wanted to go back to Germany (again, I like it)... but nope
[02:47:59] <mefistofeles> whereas I got accepted in two in the US
[02:48:03] <mefistofeles> and I'm now in one of them

[02:50:29] <HuntsMan> .....
[02:50:39] <HuntsMan> 20 months? what? really?
[02:50:43] <HuntsMan> and this was in California
[02:51:06] <mefistofeles> so, in my case, they said it could be 1-3 years

[02:52:48] <mefistofeles> HuntsMan: I cannot change jobs unless I want to start the process again, this makes sense because of what I just said
[02:52:58] <mefistofeles> whereas going out of the country I think it's permitted, yes

[02:54:39] <HuntsMan> you can go out of the US if you have a visa to return...
[02:55:05] <HuntsMan> the scam is of course the amount of power your employer has over you during that time
[02:55:52] <mefistofeles> yes, that's why you are encouraged to start the process as soon as possible, such that you can change jobs and still use your working visa until it expires (hopefully years to come)

[22:19:32] <cow_2001> you are here!
[22:19:52] <mefistofeles> :\
[22:20:01] <cow_2001> i am reading the https://course.fast.ai/ book
[22:20:01] <mefistofeles> hi

[22:20:12] <cow_2001> slooowwwwly
[22:22:25] <mefistofeles> cow_2001: nice
[22:23:00] <cow_2001> now on chapter 5 questions
[22:23:41] <cow_2001> i should probably write down all the questions for which i do not have a good answer.
[22:23:51] <cow_2001> let's do that!
[22:24:07] <mefistofeles> sure, then we can all agree we don't know the answers here as well
[22:24:11] <mefistofeles> :)
[22:25:30] <cow_2001> this book makes me think dealing with artificial neural networks is more like growing a bonsai tree than building a bridge

[22:28:25] <mefistofeles> cow_2001: it kinda is, a lot of trial and error and empiricism, rather than established protocols and complete theory. Unless you are really knowledgeable on it, which can take many years
[22:29:19] <mefistofeles> I haven't read the book, but it seems to be aimed to people that are just trying to use AI/DL/ML to do what they do, rather than developing the field itself
[22:29:39] <mefistofeles> in that sense, I can imagine why it would appear that way
[22:30:48] <cow_2001> yes, it is

[23:14:04] <mefistofeles> cow_2001: answers? where?
[23:14:31] <cow_2001> oh, in my fast-ai-book-questions-and-answers.md file
