[16:39:36] <foobaz212> hey, I'm trying to understand how to implement 1 to many schema, per this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/36631276/7212809 There's one thing I don't understand: in the "Inventory" table, why is "Item" the primary key? I thought primary keys are supposed to be unique - surely there could be duplicate items?
[16:44:16] <lopid> because that's what it is. they are. there can't be
[16:46:05] <lopid> it's just confusing because they happened to choose a stupid example
[16:50:24] <AllenJB> You might want to refer to the examples in the next answer (with table diagrams), which I think is a bit clearer as it minimizes the fields given
[16:59:09] <foobaz212> ok thanks folks
[17:00:04] <foobaz212> I'm trying to create my own 1-many table to understand this better. Concretely, a given book can have many tags. https://pastebin.com/aT7xkqC8 I'm getting a weird error and I'm not quite sure where i'm going - can someoene pls point me in the right direction?
[17:02:32] <lopid>  `books` (`id`)
[17:04:31] <foobaz212> lopid I tried that but I'm still getting the same error: https://paste.pics/ee6fb091d4951cf12cf6aaefee6608d1
[17:04:52] <lopid> … REFERENCES `books` (`id`)
[17:05:08] <foobaz212> ah ok
[17:05:52] <lopid> this assumes a tag physical, because theoretically a tag could be associated with many books
[17:18:52] <foobaz212> on sqlfiddle.com, how do I save a fiddle? Is it even possible?
[17:20:58] <foobaz212> I have a question about this simple 1-many table: https://pastebin.com/zVakeWhi I have posted my quesition in the comments for better context, but I don't understand how you can referencec an id that doesn't exist
[17:22:20] <foobaz212> when I run it on sql fiddle, it runs fine
[17:26:46] <lopid> integrity is not checked, that's up to you
[17:28:20] <foobaz212> lopid ah I see, you mean sql can only detect "compile time" errors, not runtime ones (like invalid ids)?
[17:28:24] *** Joins: masber (~masber@213.55.226.25)
[17:29:22] <foobaz212> if that's the case, I'm a bit confused how sql manages to detect if I've inserted duplicate ids
[17:30:43] <lopid> consider if you deleted book id 1. tags that refer to it don't get deleted
[17:31:18] <foobaz212> makes sense
[17:31:33] <foobaz212> ty for clarifying my beginner questions :)
[17:32:24] <foobaz212> I guess if I put on delete cascade, it will also delete things from the tags table?
[17:32:45] <lopid> yes

[18:06:10] <foobaz212> how do y'all debug these kinds of errors? The message seems so generic
[18:06:57] <lopid> it's often a typo just before the quoted bit
[18:07:34] <lopid> here, you have "where" before the inner join
[18:11:02] <foobaz212> ty
[18:16:49] <foobaz212>  https://paste.pics/62bd1597144825153a38a1c5fb353bd3 I can't quite interpret this error. Is it saying that it can't find a reference to "t.tag"? I don't understand this because tag is a valid column for the tags columns (varaiablized as `t`)
[18:17:22] <lopid> aliased
[18:17:47] <lopid> it's just "="

[18:23:10] <foobaz212> one things I don't understand: so I have this column in the `tags` columns -   `book_id` int(6)  unsigned NOT NULL REFERENCES `books`(`id`). However, if I remove the REFERENCES `books(`id`)`, my queries still work fine
[18:23:40] <foobaz212> what is the point of adding REFERENCES at all then? Is it just for optimization purposes?
[18:24:17] <foobaz212> in the `tags` table*
[18:28:46] <lopid> for one, it lets you know how the tables are related. another, you can't create a reference to something that doesn't exist
