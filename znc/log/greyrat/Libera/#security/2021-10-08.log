[04:45:29] <Hydragyrum> other than that, SSL is actually pretty decently secure and designed to avoid mitm attacks, so if it stays as ssl and you can't get it downgraded or get the keys (which aren't transmitted in any way you can sniff out) from the machines involved
[04:45:40] <HaMsTeRs> I want to strip all SSL encryption on all protocols.

[04:59:48] <HaMsTeRs> Btw.  I'm thinking to get a M1 mac (book), but I do a lot of Windows Server virtualization for labs.  I know that QEMU does fully emulate.  Not sure it would work with Windows server.  Anyone got similar experience?  Thanks (noted it's a bit off topic thou)
[05:00:31] <Apachez> microsoft seems to get picky about TPM in future, dunno how qemu deals with that
[05:00:53] <Apachez> since its emulator it should be able to emulate the tpm feature of the cpu aswell ;)
[05:01:31] <Apachez> HaMsTeRs: sslstrip doesnt work on just https traffic, it works on ssl traffic
[05:01:43] <HaMsTeRs> Hydragyrum: I remember why I failed last time, it's because I'm not trying to decrypt only Web browser traffics.  I want to decrypt all SSL / TLS traffics from all applications
[05:01:59] <Hydragyrum> oh
[05:02:34] <Hash> You'd need private keys used for all servers then
[05:02:44] <Hydragyrum> Apachez, yes qemu/kvm does support virtual TPM
[05:03:42] <HaMsTeRs> Hash: if HTTPS traffic can do in similar way, I'm sure all other traffics can.  I just don't know which tools

[05:07:33] *** Joins: ozarker (~ozarker@172-15-173-110.lightspeed.mssnks.sbcglobal.net)
[05:08:08] <Hash> So the problem is that unless you control all the servers for all traffic
[05:08:22] <Hash> You need keys for all those services using ssl/tls
[05:08:41] <Hash> Then you can easily decrypt. If you want to 'strip' then you'd need to redirect traffic from ssl to non ssl
[05:09:11] <Hash> That again depends on the servers. If the servers offer only secure services, you can't 'strip' ssl (that's a practice for redirecting ssl to non ssl)
[05:09:29] <HaMsTeRs> yes, SSL re-encrypt is ok.  like MitM, coz we are authorized to do so
[05:09:31] <Hash> For decrypting all traffic as mitm, you need keys for all the traffic, all the services that use the key
[05:09:55] <Hash> What exactly are you trying to do, and why?
[05:10:09] <Hash> Can you provide any more information to help me understand?
[05:10:34] <HaMsTeRs> Or similar question: how firewalls analyze/scan encrypted suspicious traffics?  That's exactly what I'm trying to do
[05:10:42] <HaMsTeRs> suspecious traffics like C2 activities
[05:10:46] <HaMsTeRs> .
[05:11:48] <Hash> So if you look at the https packet structure, you'll see that it cannot look at encrypted data.
[05:12:25] <Hash> The router can see all the other parts of the packet, but it cannot know what data something contains.
[05:12:34] <Hash> Firewall cannot do that either.
[05:13:30] <Hash> Now, due to how regular sites are https, firewall is the client ip at the point, not your internal natted ip
[05:13:36] <HaMsTeRs> This is the reason why IDP/IDS are useless now days
[05:14:00] <Hash> So when the firewall is actually talking to the https server on your behalf, the firwall is the client. forwarding packets to you on internal network
[05:14:21] <Hash> so the firewall is the clienit at that point, and then using the public key it talks to the server who uses private key
[05:14:31] <Hash> So that's how stateful packet inspection works
[05:15:07] <Hash> it keeps track of active connetions, source/dest ip and many other factors
[05:15:32] <Hash> But as for mitm on all ssl traffic on any server, any software, any app, you need to be able to control each server
[05:15:51] <Hash> For example, I talk to my bank website on https. You can sniff all the traffic you want, you won't know what in it. No firewall will.
[05:16:19] <Hash> Only I would. As the certificate and etc. is browser side.
[05:16:35] <HaMsTeRs> unless re-encryption occur?   force client to trust the mitm cert
[05:16:44] <Hash> So you need to be able to control all servers or else have their private keys in order to decrypt the ssl traffic.
[05:16:45] <HaMsTeRs> like what fiddler does
[05:16:54] <Hash> That's possibloe.
[05:17:30] <Hash> I mean homograph attacks are fairly common in phishing
[05:17:54] <Hash> and ssl with let'sencrpyt is free
[05:18:08] <Hash> so you can see the problem.
[05:18:29] <Apachez> when homos attacks?
[05:18:36] <Hash> yes
[05:18:39] <Hash> homos = men

[06:15:57] <sh4rk> quantity != quality
[06:16:08] <sh4rk> you lookin to deface some pages mate
[06:16:08] <sh4rk> lol
[06:16:30] <sh4rk> or get goofy with ><>?
[06:16:36] <MadCamel> I was once in richard stallman's account on athena. Sometimes quantity leads to quality. Opens up options you didn't know you had.
[06:16:41] <sh4rk> that's waht i'd consider low hanging fruit
[06:17:00] <sh4rk> on athena bot?
[06:17:07] <sh4rk> you mean baked's bot from malwaretech?
[06:17:08] <sh4rk> lol
[06:17:33] <MadCamel> no I mean the labs at mit.edu
[06:17:36] <sh4rk> ohh
[06:18:18] <sh4rk> yea there was this little shitty athena irc bot (centralized) that baked made long ago
[06:18:36] <sh4rk> sold it on hackforums, it grew popularity quick (during the betabot and touchmymalware and umbreon days)
[06:18:57] <MadCamel> ahh
[06:19:07] <sh4rk> and yes, touchme did write that malware. he just cleaned up after he made a lot of bitcoin from it
[06:19:23] <sh4rk> this was right after liberty reserve changed to bitcoin
[06:19:29] <sh4rk> LR got popped and bitcoin arose
[06:21:09] <MadCamel> My heyday was before commercialized malware was really a thing. Honestly all the profiteering took the fun out of everything.
[06:22:57] <sh4rk> mine was too, i followed it through the years

[07:31:34] <sh4rk> they payout nicely because when combined with an exploit, what 2 do?
[07:32:32] <sh4rk> a sandbox escape alone wont pay out, but if you have an exploit that leads to that pivot, thats $80k minimum in one swing

[14:55:23] <tomreyn> also, most browser fingerprinting systems seem to consider Linux to have a higher likelyness of scripted access, thus forcing you through the CAPTCHA.

[21:07:22] <plank> would a troll argue the point or not?
[21:08:12] <NiLon> the troll would make a false claim and argue about it
[21:08:23] <plank> yeah im not arguing
[21:08:38] <plank> just raising concerns
[21:09:19] <plank> would be nice to see this channel have a healthrier culture
[21:09:24] <plank> healthier*

[23:04:22] <sartan> malloc can request as much memory as it wants until it's actually used it doesn't matter. you can malloc exabytes of ram... there are a few bits used for addressing but it doesn't forecast your actual consumption at all until something actually maps to it
[23:05:01] <viq|w> Well, in some places I am, and there I didn't really look whether doas is available. I guess some things that escalate privileges assume sudo and may break that way, but GUI tools most likely use... what's the name of that privilege framework? PackageKit?
[23:05:45] <sartan> malloc askes for virtual memory, not real memory.. so it may be in ram, it may be swap, no idea at runtime, and there's no limit to it
