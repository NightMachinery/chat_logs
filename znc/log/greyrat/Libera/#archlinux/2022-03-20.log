[02:16:24] <kj7rrv> mpan: oh okay
[02:16:25] <mpan> Edu4rdSHL: huh? Isn’t it building just any AUR package?
[02:16:26] <rcf> kj7rrv: so if you have more than one system, or other people have expressed interest, go for it. 
[02:16:51] <kj7rrv> rcf: i don't know of anyone else who has, but I could do it and see
[02:16:53] <Edu4rdSHL> mpan, nope, it has 2485 packages only
[02:16:54] <mpan> kj7rrv: but also you are then responsible, at least in moral terms, about the packages being rebuilt if needed and so on.
[02:17:02] <mpan> Edu4rdSHL: oh. I was wrong then. :O
[02:17:13] <mpan> kj7rrv: see, I was wrong. Chaotic is not offering all the packages.
[02:17:29] <Edu4rdSHL> mpan, we review the packages requests and manually add the packages to our builders
[02:17:35] <mpan> But it still is offering some of them. So yes, you can. And there are many unofficial repos that do the same.
[02:17:42] <kj7rrv> Yeah, i couldn't guarantee quick updates
[02:18:06] <mpan> kj7rrv: but then, again, if people are fine with it: it’s totally possible. It’s between you and them.
[02:18:12] <Edu4rdSHL> And only packages that builds in a clean chroot environment are added (as that's what we do), which is a rule that not much AUR packages met.

[02:18:59] <mpan> From Arch’s point of view there are only two things to consider. First: they must add another repo to their “pacman.conf”. Second: they should understand their position while asking for help on official support channels, since one is expected to build their own packages.

[02:27:33] <kj7rrv> I would say on the web site that downloads are logged if I did that
[02:27:33] <DeepDayze> Ahh thanks for the clarification rcf
[02:27:44] <thrice> Earnestly: the audacity thing seems like a lose/lose
[02:27:47] <jamesp> I got Audacity 2.4.1
[02:28:04] <DeepDayze> the older versions are pretty good
[02:28:19] <jamesp> Thanks for letting me know! I'll preserve the IRC logs.
[02:28:23] <rcf> DeepDayze: and I absolutely despise the Arch approach here, which is to officially package an unsupported version to keep the new ones out of the AUR without actually having the balls to target it specifically. 
[02:28:31] <Earnestly> thrice: Yes, that is often a consequence.  One of the other goals is to push out developers who would otherwise write software for that 'space', specifically developers who might want to write such code
[02:29:01] <Earnestly> Iow, create an environment which excludes a whole class of programmers who would be inclined to write telemetry into their software
[02:29:05] <DeepDayze> rcf: not even Debian does that and I agree
[02:29:35] <DeepDayze> I use both debian and Arch.
[02:30:00] <thrice> I don't mind opt-in telemetry, though
[02:30:04] <rcf> I fully support telemetry in software. 
[02:30:10] <thrice> same
[02:30:14] <DeepDayze> Winblows has telemetry as well
[02:30:25] <DeepDayze> not easy to opt out of
[02:30:28] <Earnestly> This is why separate communities need to be allowed to exist
[02:30:31] <thrice> so does kde, and debian, and...
[02:30:52] <DeepDayze> then maybe some special repo for such software be needed
[02:30:55] <rcf> So often people whine about how Linux users are ignored or developers don't understand what users want... and those people opt out of the statistics that would let them argue their case. 
[02:31:13] <DeepDayze> The AUR has its rules so does the main Arch repos
[02:31:27] <rcf> These days I find the AUR to have stricter rules, which amuses me.

[02:33:22] <DeepDayze> Truth
[02:33:22] <Scimmia> completely anonymous telemetry with no identifiable information is one thing, that is another
[02:33:46] <DeepDayze> Telemetry is a two edged sword
[02:33:47] <Earnestly> It's less a slippery slope and more a sluice gate
[02:33:49] <thrice> debian is an example of it working well, imo

[02:35:01] <thrice> you can't generalize it as a "slippery slope" when there are several examples that keep it sane
[02:35:17] <Earnestly> I said it was a sluice gate
[02:35:30] <Earnestly> And I can, of course I can.  I'm not trying to convince you, or argue a point
[02:35:36] <DeepDayze> and popcon is totally optional so it's opt in
[02:35:58] <Earnestly> I did note at the start, opt-out telemetry is spyware

[03:09:33] <Scimmia> looks like an old package, so pacman should be offering to remove it, unless this is some other distro that still has it in the repos and pacman is trying to install it at the same time

[03:10:29] <Earnestly> (I assume -Sy was used)
[03:10:29] <Scimmia> gedit doesn't 'replace' it, so if you don't have gedit, it could have been hanging around

[10:35:28] <sheep> fails with the same error
[10:35:32] <Ghosthree3> yep
[10:35:43] <Ghosthree3> actually just broken package, that the maintainer has updated at least twice that ive noticed while its broken
[10:35:52] <Ghosthree3> i THINK its probably a systemd bug, but that doesnt really excuse the issue
[10:36:23] <sheep> does /etc/gitea/app.ini exist?
[10:36:28] <Ghosthree3> its not supposed to

[10:36:43] <Ghosthree3> he user configuration file is located at /etc/gitea/app.ini and is created the first time Gitea is run. There is also an example configuration file located at /etc/gitea/app.example.ini. 
[10:36:55] <sheep> it's probably failing because ReadWritePaths= only works with files that exist
[10:37:16] <Ghosthree3> if it doesnt exist you're meant to be hit by a wizard on first run that will create the file
[10:37:41] <sheep> it starts if I create an empty app.ini in that directory
[10:38:00] <Ghosthree3> hm, so you think i can just `touch` the file and still get the wizard?
[10:38:04] <sheep> and it still runs the wizard
[10:38:06] <Ghosthree3> i guess that'll work fine, very very stupid though
[10:38:35] <sheep> the maintainer should probvably change the ReadWritePaths to be /etc/gitea
[10:38:35] <Ghosthree3> tbf if a red note was just added to the wiki saying a bug or w.e caused an issue unless the file existed and to touch the file before first run that'd be fine

[15:40:57] <TDSI> Hello !
[15:42:05] <phaisedArray> TDSI: Welcome
[15:42:31] <TDSI> phaisedArray I just had a quick question, I reported something down in the #archlinux-bugs channel a few days ago & was met with no answer
[15:42:36] <TDSI> That channel isn't really active anymore is it?.
[15:42:48] <TDSI> It's a honestly minor bug, which is why I wasn't sure if I should make a bugtracker report
[15:42:58] <thurstylark> it is, but the bugbot rolls stuff away sometimes if nobody's watching
[15:43:05] <thurstylark> what bug number
[15:43:19] <thurstylark> oh, wait, nvm :P
[15:43:27] <airmailsteam> Does anyone else have problems running vscode on wayland? It runs fine via xwayland but as when I pass the wayland flags wiki mentions (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Visual_Studio_Code#Running_natively_under_Wayland), I get the following errors and it does not launch at all: 
[15:43:29] <phrik> Title: Visual Studio Code - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[15:43:29] <airmailsteam> Warning: 'enable-features' is not in the list of known options, but still passed to Electron/Chromium.
[15:43:30] <airmailsteam> Warning: 'ozone-platform' is not in the list of known options, but still passed to Electron/Chromium.
[15:43:48] <Namarrgon> TDSI: -bugs is for discussions around the bugtracker, it's not for reporting bugs
[15:43:54] <thurstylark> ^
[15:44:01] <TDSI> Ah my apologies
[15:44:06] <TDSI> I will do a bug on the bugtracker then & just set the severity to low
[15:44:16] <TDSI> TLDR : when you install arch with "archinstall" and select a desktop such as kde or gnome
[15:44:23] <TDSI> the discover shop doesn't work by default because it's missing a qt5 package
[15:44:26] *** Quits: bindu (~bindu@user/bindu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:44:39] <thurstylark> isn't archinstall still experimental?
[15:44:40] <Namarrgon> you could report this directly on the archinstall tracker
[15:44:47] *** Joins: bindu (~bindu@user/bindu)
[15:44:54] <TDSI> i think it's still experimental yeah
