[00:00:33] <harwiltz> somiaj: I don't even see how the distance function actually matters. Like yeah we need a metric to define H/X, but regardless of which metric we use the proof is the same as long as the distances between points not in X dont change.
[00:01:16] <harwiltz> And the problem doesn't ask me to define H/X, so I don't think I actually need to worry about that

[00:02:44] <somiaj> I'll let you be the judge if you need to include the details of the metric on the quotient space and how it relates to the metric in the original space (this is important to ensure convergence)
[00:03:02] <harwiltz> Right. I think I've got it from here, thanks again!
[00:03:13] <somiaj> because if the metrics are not related, then convergence in the original space won't necessarly imply convergence int he quotient space
[00:03:44] <harwiltz> Right. I need to make sure it
[00:03:46] <somiaj> so X is closed is needed but only to ensure you have a metric that you can releate between the two spaces, and can define what a bounded sequence means in H/X. How many of these details you need is up to you though

[00:04:29] <somiaj> that is why I suggest take y our sequence h_k, and throw out the finite number of x's, so when you pull it back to the original space your sequence is outside of X, and thus the distance function is the same between the two spaces
[00:04:59] <harwiltz> Right, lol. So it's just a matter of showing that the concept of such a topology on H/X isn't absurd
[00:05:13] <somiaj> If the details of why you can create the metric on H/X because X is closed is needed in your proof, I can't make a call on that.

[00:40:08] <isekaijin> In characteristic different from 2, every quadratic form can be diagonalized, and therefore, every conic is isomorphic to P^1 in a fairly straightforward way.

[01:05:36] <Z-module> Nitpick: those two topologies do agree when any single X_n is {} (so the whole cartesian product is {} )_, or when all but finitely many of the X_n are singleton sets.

[01:09:24] <Z-module> I guess if all but finitely many are indiscrete spaces, the two are the same
[01:09:33] <Z-module> you have to rule out lots of stupid cases
[01:10:37] <cuppajoeman> Sorry I'll rephrase my question. I can see that the set of U1 x ... x Un is a basis for X1 x ... Xn (because they told me) and they hint that finite intersections from the set {pi_i^-1(u_i): U_i open in X_i} is also a basis for it too
[01:10:56] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]:   a^b  (complex a and b, with a nonzero) means any possible value of  exp(log(a^b)) = exp(b log(a)) = exp(b (ln(|a| + i arg(a)))).   So if that arg there is principal value, this is called the principal log.

[03:08:09] <JimmyRustles> hi
[03:08:19] <JimmyRustles> i'm trying to find the points where a line intersects a circle
[03:08:44] <somiaj> how are you describing the circle and a line?
[03:08:47] <JimmyRustles> https://i.imgur.com/h3zcPR3.png - i'm trying to find x1, y1, x2, y2 when i know x3, y3, x4, y4, and x0, y0, and r
[03:09:06] <JimmyRustles> i suppose since i know the radius and the line segments i can represent the circle and line using standard equations for those
[03:09:12] <bollu> What is the problem with the statement "there is a 95% probabaility that the true mean lies inside the confidence interval”, beyond the fact that frequentists have some sort of "philosophical problem" with it?
[03:09:34] <somiaj> well the standard equation of a circle is (x - x5)^2 + (y - y5)^2 = r^2
[03:09:46] <bollu> As far as I can tell, MATHEMATICALLY, the content of that and "if we replicated the experiment over and over again and computed a 95% confidence interval for each replication, then 95% of **those** intervals would contain the true mean." is literally the same thing?
[03:10:08] <somiaj> you can write the equation of the line as y = y3 + (y3 - y4)/(x3 - x4) (x - x3)
[03:10:11] <bollu> Like, if I ran an experiment a thousand times, with some sort of "hidden" population mean, aren't the two statements saying LITERALLY the same thing?
[03:10:22] <somiaj> substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the circle and solve using the quadratic formula

[03:31:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes

[03:42:35] <bollu> (sure)

[03:43:22] <bollu> I estimate that there's a 50/50 chance it's fair, versus having two heads?
[03:43:34] <bollu> [intuitively speaking. I don't know how to connect this to confidence]
[03:44:28] <PlanckWalk> I was thinking, suppose you flip it 5 times.  If it's fair, there's a 15/16 chance that it comes up with both heads and tails.

[03:52:03] <PlanckWalk> Yes

[04:04:43] <PlanckWalk> Worse still, we don't know whether the assumptions we made in our analysis are justified.
[04:04:59] <bollu> PlanckWalk I feel like I don't intuit the difference between  (1) P(A <= M <= B) versus (2) forall m, P(A <= m <= B | M = m)
[04:05:11] <bollu> when is one true but not the other?
[04:07:51] <PlanckWalk> Err, you mean when are they not equal?
[04:08:06] <bollu> yeah
[04:08:34] <bollu> could you give me a simple example please?
[04:12:01] <bollu> Whoops, I meant: (1) P(A <= M <= B) = k versus (2) forall m, P(A <= m <= B | M = m) = k
[04:12:12] <PlanckWalk> Sure, but it won't be an example involving confidence intervals (since they're designed so (2) holds and therefore (1) holds
[04:12:59] <bollu> Yes, I understand
[04:13:05] <PlanckWalk> One example would be A is a "random variable" that always takes value -1, and B always takes value 1.
[04:13:23] <bollu> and M?
[04:13:29] <PlanckWalk> So you have P(A <= M <= B) = P(-1 <= M <= 1) = k.
[04:13:55] <PlanckWalk> Don't care much about M except that it takes some values both in [-1,1] and out.
[04:15:06] <PlanckWalk> So k is neither 0 nor 1, and then P(-1 <= m <= 1 | M=m) is either 0 or 1, never k.
[04:15:19] <bollu> mh
[04:16:24] <PlanckWalk> P(A <= M <= B) = Integral_{m in range(M)} P(A <= m <= B | M=m) P(M=m)
[04:16:32] <bollu> To check I follow along: say A=-1 (constant, B = 1(constant), and M is uniformly distributed between [-2, 2]. Then P(A <= M <= B) = 2/4 = 0.5, while P(-1 <= m <= 1 | M = m) is either 0 or 1 always?
[04:17:37] <PlanckWalk> (Ugh, I meant to express that intergral in terms of densities)
[04:18:23] <PlanckWalk> But anyway, that's the idea.  If every conditional probability in (2) is equal to k, then the probaiblity in (1) is just the average of those and so is also k.
[04:18:45] <PlanckWalk> But the reverse isn't true in general.
[04:19:50] <bollu> hmm, okay
[04:19:55] <PlanckWalk> Oh right, that's where I was going with the coin example.
[04:20:11] <bollu> so the "pointwise" condition is always stronger than the "integrated" / "global" condition?
[04:20:18] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[04:21:04] <PlanckWalk> Knowing the conditional probabilities in the coin example gives you the ability to scale any prior knowledge you had about the distribution of coins

[05:45:49] <PlanckWalk> brownorange: No
[05:46:08] <PlanckWalk> E.g. in PA, you just have an axiom schema, one axiom for each predicate.
[05:46:41] <PlanckWalk> Similarly for the axiom schemata of ZFC
[05:47:34] <brownorange> your base case must imply atleast one other case right? that's implicit in the P(n) -> P(n+1)  step?
[05:48:14] <PlanckWalk> It's logically implied, but not present in the axiom
[05:49:08] <brownorange> is the choice of base case P(0), P(1) best reflected in one axiom?
[05:49:16] <brownorange> or can i split into two axioms?
[05:49:29] <PlanckWalk> You mean if you're inventing your own formal system?
[05:49:33] <brownorange> yes

[05:51:43] <somiaj> in the case it passes through one point, x1=x2
[05:51:52] <brownorange> i'll just split into two.

[05:58:33] <louipcD> for JimmyRustles
[05:58:44] <brownorange> i'll just assume the universe is integers
[05:59:03] <isekaijin> brownorange: I hope you mean the naturals (i.e., the nonnegative integers), rather than all the integers.
[05:59:32] <brownorange> why wouldn't the negative work?

[06:00:09] <brownorange> if a negative is n, n+1 is negative+1
[06:01:56] <isekaijin> brownorange: When you define a set inductively, you have to temporarily forget any meaning that you want to assign to its elements. So, for example, if you inductively define the “integers” as “zero, the successor of every integer, and the predecessor of every integer”, then “the predecessor of the successor of zero” is not the same thing as “zero”.

[06:44:15] <brownorange> like mathematical induction?
[06:44:18] <isekaijin> As you achieve these “lesser” goals, you will be more confident and be able to tackle more difficult ones.
[06:45:07] <isekaijin> I am telling you this because I ferverntly wish someone had told me this years ago.
[06:45:13] <isekaijin> fervently*
[06:45:34] <brownorange> a more realistic goal would be to forget about substitution based proofs, and focus on path-based proofs
[06:45:55] <brownorange> to weaken my notion of formal system
[06:45:57] <isekaijin> A more realistic goal would be to understand how mathematicians actually prove things in practice.

[06:46:42] <isekaijin> Yeah, informal for formal logic's standards, anyway.

[06:56:21] <Batzy> I'm trying to find the smallest non-representable positive integer in any floating point number system. I only know the parameters b - base, p - precision, [e_min, e_max] which is the allowed range of my exponent
[06:57:07] <Batzy> I guess too I will need to use the unique representation like (-1)^s 1.f * b^e. I'm wondering why I can't just say something like anything smaller than (-1)^s 1.f * b^e_min where f uses up the rest of the precision to be .000001 or w.e
[06:57:14] <PlanckWalk> Batzy: It varies slightly depending upon your conventions

[06:58:54] <Batzy> PlanckWalk im also confused because I think precision is defined as the number of bits for the 1.f portion, but I guess the exponent part doesn't consume any of that
[06:59:04] <PlanckWalk> Like whether your representation includes the leading digit of the mantissa, or omits it
[06:59:25] <Batzy> also if precision is the number of bits...and my base is b, i guess im still talking about precision in terms of base 2?

[07:00:20] <Batzy> i guess that's true
[07:00:22] <int-e> why 1.f anyway, f should be m (mantissa)
[07:00:27] <PlanckWalk> Yes, if base can vary then you'll definitely need to clarify whether it is omitted or included for base 2 specifically
[07:00:30] <Batzy> PlanckWalk e_min can be negative, so that's included
[07:00:43] <Batzy> i do have a sign bit in my representation, but im looking for the smallest positive integer
[07:01:19] <PlanckWalk> Ah okay, I guess the "precision" is just talking about mantissa digits excluding sign
[07:01:26] <PlanckWalk> (Rather than including sign)
[07:01:27] <int-e> that is, 1?

[07:04:13] <Batzy> int-e the question i am looking at says you can make a simplifying assumption of  p <= e_max
[07:04:20] <Batzy> I have no idea why that would help
[07:04:24] <int-e> wtf is p
[07:04:26] <Batzy> so I feel like I am completely missing something
[07:04:30] <Batzy> int-e the precision
[07:05:03] <Batzy> so if you doing 1<mantissa bits = 0>1 then the # of mantissa bits + 2 = p I would guess
[07:05:08] <int-e> It's a reasonable assumption.
[07:05:19] <Batzy> int-e it is, but you can prove it without it
[07:05:23] <int-e> In particular it's true for the two common IEEE floating point formats.
[07:05:23] <Batzy> and i have no idea where we would be using it
[07:05:40] <Batzy> this is not IEEE, this is any floating point system that has this form
[07:06:04] <int-e> Well... in that case you should know whether you can make this assumption or not.
[07:06:13] <Batzy> I'm allowed to, but I don't have to

[07:07:51] <PlanckWalk> If e_max was 0 then the smallest non-representable positive integer would be b.

[07:08:38] <Batzy> what does that have to do with p
[07:08:47] <Batzy> you can say that just by knowing e_max
[07:08:47] <PlanckWalk> You can only represent (b-1).(b-1)(b-1)...(b-1)*b^0
[07:08:54] <PlanckWalk> Yes, so there are *two* buonds.
[07:09:06] <PlanckWalk> Your answer is whichever one comes first.
[07:09:35] <brownorange> @isekaijin I think so. There was simply no other way to express what is meant by mathematical induction
[07:10:02] <Batzy> PlanckWalk so there is pretty much a case when p <= e_max and p > e_max?
[07:10:20] <PlanckWalk> Depending upon exactly which convention you're using for p, yes
[07:10:37] <Batzy> ok because I still am lost, let's just assume p<= e_max for a second
[07:10:49] <PlanckWalk> That's the most common case, yes
[07:11:07] <Batzy> then it's just 1.0 * b^e_min?
[07:11:24] <PlanckWalk> Oh.  Can e_min be positive?
[07:11:35] <int-e> ...ugh
[07:11:40] <Batzy> ...i guess.?
[07:11:43] <PlanckWalk> If so, then you might not be able to represent 1.
[07:11:50] <Batzy> let's just assume it's negative
[07:11:56] <Batzy> for now
[07:12:03] <Batzy> I'm just trying to understand what im doing here
[07:12:03] <PlanckWalk> If it's not positive then it doesn't matter
[07:12:19] <Batzy> if it's not positive the answer is just 1 then?
[07:12:33] <Batzy> if it's positive, it could be something greater than 1?
[07:12:50] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[07:13:12] <Batzy> ok so ill stick with the interesting case, let's say it's positive
[07:13:14] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, so it looks like you have three cases: e_min > 0, in which case your answer is 1
[07:13:23] <Batzy> wait no
[07:13:33] <Batzy> e_min < 0 means it's 1 doesn't it?
[07:14:40] <PlanckWalk> If 0 is in [e_min, e_max], then you can represent 1
[07:14:57] <Batzy> yes so when you said "e_min > 0, in which case your answer is 1"
[07:15:02] <Batzy> you meant e_min < 0
[07:15:05] <PlanckWalk> No
[07:15:19] <Batzy> dude
[07:15:27] <Batzy> if e_min > 0 how is 0 in [e_min. e_max]
[07:15:28] <PlanckWalk> e_min > 0 means that 0 is outside [e_min, e_max]
[07:15:38] <PlanckWalk> And therefore you *can't* represent 1
[07:15:50] <PlanckWalk> And you want the smallest positive integer that *can't* be represented

[07:24:33] <PlanckWalk> Yep, that's fine
[07:24:52] <PlanckWalk> So it will be whatever gives you the least integer out of p and e_max
[07:25:19] <Batzy> what does that mean though
[07:25:40] <PlanckWalk> If p includes the leading digit (necessary for b > 2, uncommon for b = 2) then you can't represent b^p+1
[07:26:04] <Batzy> it does include the leading digit here
[07:26:32] <Batzy> PlanckWalk oh i see
[07:26:43] <Batzy> b^p + 1 is a pretty large digit, but it still the smallest non-rep
[07:26:54] <Batzy> i was looking for the small integers (close to 0) for some reason
[07:26:59] <PlanckWalk> You also can't represent b^(e_max+1)
[07:27:26] <PlanckWalk> So the smallest is  min(b^p + 1, b^(e_max + 1))
[07:27:26] <Batzy> yeah so you just take t = min(p, e_max) and you can't represent b^t + 1

[14:08:11] <Z-module> rex-: that's not the l^1 norm -- that = 0 on some nonzero vectors such as (3,-3,0,0,0,...). Should be  SUM_k |x_k|
[14:08:36] <rex-> yeah I guess that's the point to show that with the crazy norm it's not copmlete
[14:08:50] <Z-module> (that sum being the infinite series... same as the sup of the finite partial sums you had, except now with summands in absolute values)
[14:09:03] <Z-module> that is not a norm at all

[14:10:02] <Z-module> oh wait, sorry, yeah. It shouldn't be called l^1 though, I would think.

[14:11:33] <Z-module> For each p >= 1,  ||(x_k)||_p = ( SUM_k |x_k|^p )^(1/p)   is the standard thing

[17:19:53] <[itchyjunk]> wait nm, this works if c \in R too since R subset C. that was my question
[17:20:33] <isekaijin> I don't think this works in general.
[17:20:53] <isekaijin> For one, log(z) does not have a uniquely determined value.
[17:21:09] <isekaijin> So you would need to show that the value of e^{c log(z)} does not depend on your choice of log(z).
[17:21:37] <isekaijin> If c is an integer, then this is the case.

[17:33:45] <isekaijin> The whole principal value business is very sketchy. It is fine to say “let's choose a value of log(z)” for a fixed value of “z”, but making a global choice for every nonzero “z” and calling it a “function” is geometrically very ill-behaved.
[17:33:57] <[itchyjunk]> but we never talked about when it's not proper to use, maybe i'll ask professor for clarificaiton

[17:38:21] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: you didn't need exp and log up there. That number is  2 (-1/2 + i sqrt(3)/2)   and the thing in parens is a cube root of 1.  So that whole thing cubed is just 8, and sqrts of that are +/- 2sqrt(2).
[17:39:20] <sek> isekaijin: that's what's called Hartogs theorem - you can extend things outside of codimension 2

[18:42:52] <lpapp> I am currently templating the data type, like float, double, half float, int, etc.
[18:43:14] <lpapp> but got a suggestion not to have such template classes like Vec2, Vec3, and Vec4 separately, but template also based on the size of the vector.

[18:48:13] <Gurkenglas> One common reason to have high-dimensional vectors is machine learning. It's useful to be able to verify at compile time that a 100-length vector concatenated to a 200-length vector yields a 300-length vector.

[18:50:48] <lpapp> No, we do not want to use an existing library, hence asking.
[18:50:55] <isekaijin> lpapp: It really depends on your use case, but I think there is another alternative, which is simply to treat vector sizes as a runtime parameter, rather than encoding it in the type.
[18:51:34] <isekaijin> Easy to understand, and you can do it even in a dumb language like C, so no need for metaprogramming monstrosities that harm compilation times.

[18:52:01] <lpapp> isekaijin: no, this has to perform well, and it is a compile-time decision after all.
[18:52:14] <Gurkenglas> lpapp, because of licensing concerns? There exist libraries that allow commercial use.
[18:52:22] <lpapp> compilation time is not an issue here.
[18:52:38] <isekaijin> lpapp: Then template it is. Do you really want to maintain three copies of essentially the same logic?
[18:52:41] <lpapp> Gurkenglas: no, because we want to be in charge to tweak it as we want.
[18:52:54] <lpapp> isekaijin: I am not sure if it is the same logic.

[18:53:22] <lpapp> I guess one pro is that it is less complex code to maintain

[20:16:14] <Franciman> hope it clicks
[20:16:16] <cuppajoeman> I see that B contains A. So we already know that Y contains A, since A is a subset of Y, so the only way for the intersection to remain a superset of A is that C must contain A ?
[20:16:31] <Franciman> uhm it is hard
[20:16:36] <Franciman> you see that B contains A
[20:16:41] <cuppajoeman> Yes
[20:16:48] <Franciman> and B = C \cap Y
[20:16:48] <cuppajoeman> Y contains A
[20:16:59] <cuppajoeman> So then C has to contain A
[20:17:05] <cuppajoeman> Or else the intersection wouldn't
[20:17:20] <Franciman> yes, it comes from the fact that A \subset C \cap A
[20:17:26] <Franciman> i.e. the elements of A are in both C and Y
[20:17:31] <Franciman> so A is contained in C

[21:29:45] *** Quits: voices (~voices_@84.238.197.28) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:29:45] <Franciman> if you assume it is a set and prove a contradiction
[21:29:54] <Franciman> then you can reason by saying
[21:29:59] <Franciman> than it must not be a set
[21:30:07] <Franciman> for example you do this with the set of all ordinals
[21:30:12] <Franciman> if it were actually a set
[21:30:14] <Franciman> it would be an ordinal
[21:30:15] <Juliu> Franciman, that is incorrect
[21:30:29] <Franciman> but it would be the maximal ordinal
[21:30:30] <Juliu> A contradiction does not say that something does not exist
[21:30:55] <Franciman> the way you stated it is correct
[21:30:55] <Juliu> There is no reason to believe that paradoxes do not exist just because they contain a contradiction
[21:31:07] <Franciman> but if you cast it in a specific case
[21:31:11] <Franciman> it may well be the case
[21:31:21] <Franciman> that a contradictions leads to negating one of the assumptions
[21:31:30] <Juliu> It does not
[21:31:44] <Juliu> It only does if you pick certain axioms
[21:31:48] <Franciman> indeed
[21:32:04] <Juliu> And there is no reason to believe these axioms would be a good choice
[21:32:12] <Franciman> well there is one
[21:32:18] <Juliu> Which one?
[21:32:26] <Franciman> it's experimentally working fine. But I agree I hate this

[21:33:19] *** Joins: orbyt (~textual@172.92.4.78)
[21:33:43] <Franciman> ok and on the other hand you can't deny our reality contains subrealities that are free of contradictions
[21:33:44] <Juliu> I don't think any choice of axioms is better than any other. They are all equally right and wrong at the same time, since it's all relative
[21:34:09] <Franciman> an example being mathematics where ex falso quodlibet is used
[21:34:16] <Franciman> and also proof by contradiction
[21:34:20] <Juliu> I don't know what a subreality is
[21:34:43] <Franciman> mathematics can be seen as a piece of our experience, in which contradictions are banned
[21:34:48] <Franciman> and we strieve to keep them out
[21:34:58] <Franciman> so we want to rule out everything that leads to contradiction
[21:35:06] <Juliu> In some certain fields of mathematics contradictions are banned, which is a shame
[21:35:16] <Franciman> can you name a field in which contradiction is welcome?

[21:38:05] <Franciman> but for example hegel's dialectic method
[21:38:13] <Franciman> while having in itself the fact that contradictions are welcome
[21:38:18] <Franciman> it is only apparent so

[21:50:19] <Franciman> not maybe

[21:50:34] <Juliu> Of course you can define any operation as you want. But it should be consistent

[21:51:28] <Juliu> I cant remember precisely, but I think for any solution you get for x and not x, you can put it into some other equation and show that it would produce a new solution. And this solution also produces something new, and so on
[21:53:04] <Juliu> And then either Z-module or int-e came along and suggested some weird module or something like that, and then they lost me

[21:55:51] <Franciman> well what I meant
[21:55:52] <Franciman> unobservable
[21:55:59] <bildramer> the idea is if 0 = 1 then trivially, 1 = 2, and 0 = 2, and 0 != 2, and 0 + 2 != 2 + 0, and anything
[21:56:09] <Juliu> I think it's exactly the other way around: It is possible in physical reality, but only the math people think that is either has to be the one or the other thing
[21:56:29] <Juliu> Which is one realy why I said that math won't evolve much this way
[21:56:34] <Juliu> *one reason
[21:57:03] <Franciman> bildramer has a point
[21:57:12] <Franciman> from some cotradictions you can recover everything
[21:57:18] <Franciman> you end up with a theory that is not interesting
[21:57:26] <bildramer> from any contradictions, as usually defined
[21:57:34] <Juliu> What bildramer said has nothing to do with what I am talking about
[21:57:35] <Franciman> yes but you mean ex falso quodlibet
[21:57:45] <Franciman> yet what bildramer said is something important to mathematiticans
[21:58:05] <Franciman> so you get a first answer about why mathematicians care about non contradiction
[21:58:05] <bildramer> I think if you interpret "not" and one of "true" or "false" in a _meta_ way, then you can't do what you want, Juliu
[21:58:51] <Juliu> bildramer, what do you mean by one of true or false? I never said that it can't be both at the same time, or some 3rd value
[21:58:56] <bildramer> if you treat them as just symbols you apply arbitrary rules to, then you can do whatever and the new question is "does the system allow/forbid all syntactically correct strings"

[22:07:17] <Juliu> You could simply set true = 1, false = 0, AND as multiplication, NOT z as 1-z, and then you get z * (1-z) = 1, and that has 2 complex solutions. And then you take those 2 solutions and plug them in again, and get new solutions
[22:07:22] <Juliu> Something like that

[22:12:27] <Batzy> 1 + ( (1+x)(1+y)) I think?
[22:13:00] <Batzy> you're doing this arithmetic in Z/2Z right, that should work then
[22:14:27] <Juliu> Batzy, no clue. It is an equi-triangular grid in the complex place, if I remember correctly

[22:15:19] <Juliu> Batzy, don't worry, I was just meantioning this because Franciman asked
[22:15:42] <Batzy> Yeah I mean you can write the booleans like this as a subset of some C*-algebra
[22:15:57] <Juliu> And it would be   1 - ((1-x)(1-y))
[22:15:58] <Batzy> and you would be doing this in Z/2Z pretty much

[22:16:29] <Juliu> And what else?

[22:16:44] <Batzy> well they're like equivalence classes too i guess
[22:16:57] <Batzy> so -1 = 1
[22:17:01] <Batzy> so we don't write -1 as well

[22:18:13] <Juliu> No
[22:18:31] <Batzy> people would probably call that unrealistic
[22:18:43] <Batzy> let me read what you wrote
[22:18:56] <Juliu> It is like extending the real numbers and get all the complex numbers. In the end you might only be interested in the real solutions, but in the meantime you calculate with complex numbers all the time
[22:19:08] <Batzy> Juliu: I mean
[22:19:26] <Batzy> your booleans are going to live in the algebra but
[22:19:40] <Batzy> the algebra is going to be bigger, and the booleans won't have a structure of an algebra necessarily
[22:19:46] <Juliu> So we actually have to extend the boolean {true, false} value-set as well, because otherwise some boolean equations (like x and not x = true) have no solution, which is bad
[22:20:06] <Juliu> Even if you are only interested in solutions that are true or false in the end

[22:22:58] <cuppajoeman> In the base case we have to show that cal(A) |= phi iff cal(B) |= phi where phi is the formula = t1 t2
[22:23:28] <Juliu> Batzy, I am extending {true, false} by a value that solves x and not x = true. And then - to keep things closed under all boolean operations - I plug in this new value to some boolean formulas and get even more new values. And for those new values I do the same. And then you end up with infinitely many values that lie on a equi-triangular grid in the complex plane, where true (1) and false (1) are just two of these infinitely many

[22:25:50] <Juliu> Batzy, it is precisely the same you do with the reals. r^2 = -1 does not have a real solution, so you extrend the reals with all the values that are needed to have a solution for z^2 = -1 and so that everything else is consistent and closed
[22:26:06] <Juliu> Batzy, is that a "yes" or a "why"?

[23:05:06] <Juliu> isekaijin, actually, if there are only finitely many solutions for my first (triangular grid) question, that would totally change the argument why I discarded the extended boolean algebra with infinitely many values in the first place

[23:05:40] <quartz> Can someone explain part b of this proof to me please? I don't understand what they mean by "the largest index" and "adding r - 1 - (r - l) = l -1". https://ibb.co/gv23Z3d
[23:06:03] <isekaijin> Juliu: If x, y are two Gaussian integers such that xy = 1, then N(xy) = 1 implies that N(x) = N(y) = 1.

[23:15:33] <Juliu> isekaijin, since multiplying conplex numbers works by adding up their distance from 0, can't we say as well for the triangular grid, that the distance from 0 for the solution 1 is 1, and hence the sum of both distances for x and y has to be 1, and since there are only finitely many values with distances <= 1, x and y can only have these values?

[23:27:46] <Juliu> isekaijin, as we discussed before, you can extend the normal boolean algebra that only has true and false as values in such a way that you instead take all values of this triangular grid as possible values.

[23:35:25] <isekaijin> Boolean algebras are defined by a bunch of axioms.
[23:35:26] <Juliu> isekaijin, then call it something else, I dont care
[23:35:44] <Juliu> ski, i never said it was a boolean algebra
[23:35:53] <isekaijin> How are conjunction and disjunction defined on it?
[23:36:15] <isekaijin> Do they satisfy the usual laws, like, distributivity, absorption, etc.?
[23:36:16] <ski> if you saw "extended Boolean Algebra", people expect it to be at least a Boolean Algebra, and then something more
[23:36:17] <Juliu> isekaijin, I also explained that, but since you are too lazy to read before you start talking to me, here again:
[23:36:45] <Juliu> True = 1, False = 0, x AND y = xy, NOT x = 1-x

[23:36:51] *** Joins: loller_ (uid358106@id-358106.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[23:38:06] <ski> that seems like a definition of a particular one, in terms of some "numeric" structure (a ring ?)
[23:40:05] <isekaijin> Is OR simply defined using De Morgan? i.e., (x OR y) = NOT ((NOT x) AND (NOT y)) ?

[23:40:11] *** Quits: CombatVet (~c4@user/combatvet) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:40:19] <Juliu> isekaijin, how many solutions are there for x * (1-x) = 1 in this triangular grid?
[23:40:39] *** Joins: tx8r (~tx8r@gateway/tor-sasl/tx8r)
[23:40:48] *** Joins: CombatVet (~c4@user/combatvet)
[23:40:55] <Juliu> isekaijin, we discussed that before as well, and the answer is yes. x OR y = 1 - ((1-x) * (1-y))
[23:41:42] <isekaijin> Your equation becomes x^2 - x + 1 = 0, which obviously has two solutions in C, and both happen to be in the grid, since they are the complex cubic roots of -1.
[23:41:51] <Juliu> You can probably do all this differently, but this seems to be the first solution that comes to mind
[23:42:11] <isekaijin> What I am really missing is the motivation for this.
[23:42:27] <Juliu> isekaijin, what are the complex cubic roots of -1 ?
[23:42:36] <isekaijin> Uh.
[23:42:39] <isekaijin> Compute them yourself.
[23:42:43] <isekaijin> It is not that hard.
[23:43:03] <Juliu> Because I think one solution is definitely 1/2 + sqrt(3)/2, and I'm not sure if that is a complex cubic root of -1
[23:43:16] <isekaijin> You are missing an i factor, but yes.
[23:43:21] <Juliu> Yes
[23:43:28] <Juliu> And the other is the same with a - sign
[23:43:31] <isekaijin> Right.
[23:43:49] <Juliu> And I bet the 3rd complex cubic root of -1 is -1 then, right?
[23:43:53] <isekaijin> Obviously.
[23:44:12] <isekaijin> But when I said “complex”, I meant the non-real ones.
[23:44:33] <isekaijin> Because x^2 - x + 1 = 0, being a quadratic equation, can only have two solutions, counted with multiplicity.
[23:44:36] <cherim> Seriously, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstein_integer has answers to everything including not yet asked
[23:44:51] <isekaijin> Anyhow.
[23:44:52] <Juliu> So the 2 solutions that are not -1 are the solutions for x and not x = true then?
[23:45:19] <isekaijin> Juliu: Well, assuming that you define “and” and “not” that way.
[23:45:38] <isekaijin> But you have to give waaay more motivation for others to accept your definitions of “and” and “not”.
[23:45:42] <riv> hello
[23:45:47] <isekaijin> Hello.
[23:46:06] <Juliu> I seem to have overestimated the fact that I have infinitely many points in that triangular grid, since it seems I always end up with finitely many solutions
[23:46:35] <Juliu> isekaijin, I don't care about others. They can do whatever they want
[23:46:41] <Juliu> Hi riv
[23:47:18] <loller_> can anyone tell me if this solution makes any sense? http://mathb.in/66723
[23:47:24] <loller_> the problem is included in the mathb.in
[23:47:41] <isekaijin> A polynomial equation in one variable always has finitely many solutions. (Not counting things like the silly “0 = 0” case, of course.)
[23:47:58] <Juliu> isekaijin, it would be interesting to see what happens when you're AND-ing a few multivariate clauses that normally would result in 0 or in 1 solution only for the normal boolean algebra
[23:48:23] <Juliu> isekaijin, the x*y = 1 thing also had finitely many (6) solutions only
[23:48:35] <isekaijin> Anyhow.
[23:48:38] <isekaijin> Algebraic geometry time!
[23:48:47] <isekaijin> More precisely, characteristic 2 nonsense.
[23:48:53] <loller_> it seems simplistic somehow what I did there
[23:49:08] <isekaijin> Let's work over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2.
[23:49:19] <loller_> given that these are expansions you find in literature for the plane wave equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane-wave_expansion
[23:49:37] <loller_> on the other hand we are not supposed to know anything about special functions like spherical Bessel functions yet
[23:49:40] <Juliu> isekaijin, are you still referring to me, or to loller_ ?
[23:49:47] <isekaijin> Neither.
[23:49:48] <loller_> so they can't be asking for anything that complicated
[23:49:55] <isekaijin> I want to show that every irreducible quadratic form in three variables can be rewritten as xz = y^2, after a linear change of variables.
[23:50:05] <Juliu> Well, then good luck with your algebra stuff

[23:51:12] <isekaijin> Okay, since we are working in characteristic 2, then our irreducible quadratic form must have a cross term like xy.
[23:51:25] <isekaijin> Because x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 in characteristic 2.
[23:52:00] <brownorange> Starting with metavars. Metavars are logic of association. Yet it is said that logic axioms need metavars (i'm guessing in predicate calclus case)
[23:52:01] <isekaijin> Now, I would like to prove that, after a linear change of variables, I can obtain an expression with just a single cross term.
[23:53:02] *** Quits: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[23:53:07] <brownorange> logic proofs are done by substitution, to claim that propositional calculus needs axiom schemes is incoherent to me.
[23:53:10] <isekaijin> If I have two cross terms, say, xy + xz, then I can use x(y + z).
[23:53:24] <isekaijin> But what if I have all three cross terms, xy + xz + yz?
[23:53:31] <isekaijin> How do I reduce to something that has just one cross term?
[23:53:41] <brownorange> likewise then also requiring metavars to study/learn proofs of the logic. utterly bananas.

[23:59:20] <isekaijin> brownorange: An axiom scheme is just a way to give a finite specification of infinitely many axioms.
[23:59:30] <isekaijin> There is nothing terribly complicated about that.
