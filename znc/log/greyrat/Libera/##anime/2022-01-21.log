[00:36:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hardly. You can use ALAC in mp4 I think.
[00:36:53] <Bco1981> well wave wasn't supported
[00:37:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14#Data_streams
[00:37:04] <ImoutoBot> [title] MPEG-4 Part 14 - Wikipedia
[00:37:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Opus & FLAC are recent additions.
[00:38:13] <Bco1981> i had one video that aac f'ed up the audio.
[00:38:18] <Bco1981> ogg saved it.
[00:38:45] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: sharpie or pen
[00:39:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: ???
[00:39:21] <MootPoot> I see
[00:40:32] <Bco1981> hmm vorbis(ogg) is also lossy...
[00:46:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well yes, FLAC is what you want for lossless.
[00:48:24] <Bco1981> and it has compression levels
[00:48:34] <Roey> pkzip o/
[00:50:10] <Bco1981> flac compression level 0 is a bigger file then wave...
[00:50:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> What bitwidth?
[00:50:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because uncompressed flac is roughly the same as uncompressed pcm
[00:50:53] <Bco1981> not set
[00:51:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not set means default.
[00:51:08] <Bco1981> this one is 12mb bigger then the wave version
[00:51:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Are the defaults the same for both types?

[00:56:42] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: converting is kinda stupid in this scenario i have here. i could just demux it from the source, and mux it into my output video.
[00:57:13] <Bco1981> it originates from a mp4 video file that is sounding fine. might aswell just keep the audio as is.
[00:57:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ffmpeg has options for copying audio streams verbatim into compatible containers.
[00:57:55] <Bco1981> yeah
[00:58:11] <MootPoot> emmeka: if this optical cable makes a difference - well, I'll be surprised
[00:58:15] <MootPoot> but we shall see

[01:00:33] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[01:00:37] <emmeka> MootPoot keep in mind that it won't make a difference *unless* other grounds are disconnected from the device as well
[01:00:54] <emmeka> ie, there need to be only toslink cables going into the soundbar
[01:01:01] <MootPoot> the thing needs a power supply
[01:01:06] <emmeka> yes, that is 1 ground
[01:01:15] <emmeka> it's a problem when there's more than 1
[01:02:13] <MootPoot> I just did the bad thing
[01:02:19] <MootPoot> I signed up for a 2 year plan with my isp
[01:03:11] <MootPoot> I'm hacking a printer shop
[01:03:20] <MootPoot> one wonders why they would even have a printer shop in like
[01:03:23] <MootPoot> the year 2300
[01:03:33] <MootPoot> or even today really
[01:03:38] <MootPoot> emmeka: why does paper still exist
[01:03:42] <MootPoot> it offends me
[01:04:11] <emmeka> but paper is best

[01:04:45] <MootPoot> if my keyboard is even *slightly* off angle I will end up missing a letter
[01:05:02] <MootPoot> and have weird typos where my letters are swapped around
[01:06:02] <Bco1981> did you get your keyboard yet ?
[01:06:08] <MootPoot> I need to bluetooth connect to my coffee mug
[01:06:21] <MootPoot> Bco1981: yeah
[01:09:24] <Sapphirus>  <MootPoot> emmeka: if this optical cable makes a difference - well, I'll be surprised < How could you not tell? That's the real question.
[01:09:38] <MootPoot> I dont have any ground loop issues
[01:09:41] <MootPoot> no hum, no static
[01:09:52] <MootPoot> which seems to be the whole deal
[01:09:56] <emmeka> Sapphirus he's comparing digital to digital, tbf
[01:10:27] <Sapphirus> You can create a ground loop with an electrical digital connection.
[01:10:33] <emmeka> right.
[01:10:44] <emmeka> that's what I convinced him to try out
[01:11:40] <emmeka> as far as actual signal quality, there's no real difference between DP/HDMI and toslink, besides the absence of HDCP mucking things up on occasion.
[01:14:23] <Sapphirus> HDMI is also a pain in the ass as it'll create a faux display with a hifi receiver
[01:14:35] <Sapphirus> There's literally no advantage to bothering.
[01:14:38] <Sapphirus> imho
[01:15:19] <Sapphirus> At least in terms of using it as a transport medium from your PC.

[07:37:34] <ButterNoodle> may look that one up tbh
[07:37:40] <Guest11> ie anime is a japanese product and western animation is not considered anime - the term they use is the same - the terms we use are different - but the distinction is unchanged - the same distinction we make between animation like avatar and japanese anime is also made by the japanese
[07:37:43] <amigojapan> Guest11: just don't call it just "anime
[07:37:57] <K0K1> man, i wanna rematch on russian roulette i cant beileve i lost
[07:38:02] <ButterNoodle> yea anyone can use toonboom and crank out western cartoons

[07:38:19] <Guest11> these days
[07:38:53] <Guest11> this is not a japanese discussion so its irrelevent to use the terms the japanese use them

[07:40:23] <amigojapan> In English you could use "japanimation" Guest11 
[07:40:55] <Guest11> but why if its already understood to mostly mean japanese animation
[07:40:58] <Guest11> ie anime
[07:41:10] <Guest11> and not western animation
[07:41:18] <amigojapan> But that is confusing
[07:41:20] <Guest11> which was the relevent distinction here
[07:41:32] <amigojapan> Cause of how it is used in Japanese
[07:41:39] <Guest11> since avatar is a western animation with anime like motives
[07:41:55] <Guest11> yes but were discussing it from a western standpoint
[07:42:18] <amigojapan> Speak for yourself
[07:42:26] <Guest11> if i discussed it with a japanese i would clarify that but it would be pretty clear anyway
[07:42:42] <amigojapan> Why do I need to take a Western standpoint?
[07:43:34] <Guest11> you dont need to - it was my assumption since the chat is in english

[07:43:50] <Guest11> ie this wouldnt be confusing to "westerners" who would mostly use the chat
[07:43:50] <amigojapan> Well done assume then
[07:43:57] <Guest11> why not?
[07:44:20] <Guest11> its the most appropriate assumption
[07:44:30] <Guest11> if it was japanese chat it would be in japanese
[07:44:40] <amigojapan> This is an international server
[07:44:53] <Guest11> yes and most international people are not from japan
[07:44:58] <Guest11> so my point still stands
[07:45:03] <Guest11> its an appropriate assumption
[07:45:08] <amigojapan> Neither are they Western
[07:45:34] <Guest11> so youre saying they dont use the term anime like westerners do?
[07:45:47] <Guest11> since as far as i know most non asians do
[07:46:02] <amigojapan> I am saying that you can't assume everyone here uses it that way
[07:46:25] <Guest11> the assumption was that most do and it would be a common understanding that the discussion would use the terms this way
[07:46:37] <Guest11> a japanese who knows english would also understand that
[07:47:18] <klaxa> a person that understands culture knows that westerners talking about "anime" are weebs and japs talking about "anime" are probably also weebs, but could be talking about spongebob squarepants
[07:47:22] <Guest11> regardless its a simple misunderstanding and weve cleared it out right

[07:48:06] <Guest11> klaxa thats just derisive and silly - most western culture refers to japanese animation as anime - ones that dont are the actual weebs
[07:48:07] <klaxa> no! stop adding quotes for me!
[07:48:21] <Guest11> oh wait its a quote sorry

[07:51:18] <mattmob> hello
[07:51:59] <Guest11> thats ok - but demanding others use them in such a way isnt - basically if there was a misunderstanding you asked and we cleared it - thats how it should be

[07:52:18] <Guest11> ie to use them in the way you think they should be used

[07:53:28] <amigojapan> For example hentai means pervert
[07:53:39] <Guest11> it measnt weirdo
[07:53:59] <Guest11> measnt no idea how that happened lol
[07:54:42] <amigojapan> It does not mean animation porn
[07:55:18] <Guest11> hentai means weirdo and since sex is weird in japan be extension it means a sexual weirdo ie pervert
[07:55:53] <Guest11> but thats in japan
[07:56:09] <Guest11> in the west it means japanese animated porn
[07:56:34] <amigojapan> I don't accept the Western way of thinking in Japanese terms
[07:57:17] <amigojapan> That's just a miss understood
[07:57:28] <amigojapan> Misunderstanding
[07:57:30] <Guest11> ok but when we communicate if we are to use terminology differently it would have to be clarified either beforehand or during the communication
[07:57:58] <amigojapan> Ok I allow clarifications
[07:58:10] <Guest11> or just be aggreed upon to use descriptive terminology like japanese animated porn

[08:03:08] <Guest11> how so?
[08:03:29] <amigojapan> Guest11: my father was American but I grew up in Mexico

[08:04:15] <amigojapan> Ok then
[08:04:28] <amigojapan> Then I was
[08:06:36] <Guest11> anyway using terminology different than the japanese doesnt erase them or anything - using japanese words as terminology in ways different than the japanese - maybe some dont like it - but its already very widespread
[08:07:18] <Guest11> and since communication is about function - ie exchanging information - using the terms in the widespread sense is only the most straightforward and practical approach
[08:07:36] <Guest11> instead of defining terminology before a discussion etc

[08:09:16] <Guest11> native culture was mostly erased unfortunately by the spanish
[08:09:47] <Guest11> ie as far as actual culture is concerned - there is some cultural heritage but day to day and general culture was erased
[08:10:01] <Guest11> pretty brutally infact
[08:10:16] <Guest11> across most of central and south america
[08:10:36] <amigojapan> Mexico is North America
[08:10:51] <Guest11> yes and mexico
[08:11:14] <ButterNoodle> yes before Europe all was well with the world
[08:11:48] <Guest11> hardly - besides it was bound to happen eventually - it it wasnt europe it would have been the likes of china and india
[08:11:58] <ButterNoodle> naaa
[08:12:05] <Guest11> yeah
[08:12:06] <Guest11> lol
[08:12:35] <amigojapan> Maybe Mexico could have invaded Europe
[08:12:45] <ButterNoodle> ask me how my myandotte chert ended up around the world
[08:12:54] <ButterNoodle> *wyandotte chert
[08:12:56] <amigojapan> We were sick
[08:13:19] <ButterNoodle> yea... 
[08:13:45] <ButterNoodle> yall using my chert possibly 1000 years before columbus came all over america
[08:14:12] <amigojapan> !c chert
[08:14:13] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Chert is a hard, fine-grained sedimentary rock composed of microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline quartz, the mineral form of silicon dioxide. Chert is characteristically of biological origin, but may also occur inorganically as a chemical precipitate or a diagenetic replacement, as in petrified wood.
[08:14:13] <ButterNoodle> we were getting along great.. trading, bartering.. all the worlds treasures and doujins
[08:15:02] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: tru story.. wyandotte chert has been found in eastern europe, and the southern most part of south america
[08:15:08] <ButterNoodle> its only found in a small area in indiana
[08:15:17] <Guest11> globalization was inevitable - if any other state with sufficient resources had discovered the americas they would have colonized them in the same manner - no state would ever pass on the economic value
[08:15:23] <ButterNoodle> *best chert in the world
[08:15:38] <amigojapan> I am still not sure what it is ButterNoodle 
[08:15:47] <Guest11> its a rock
[08:16:06] <ButterNoodle> u know how limestone will wash away little cracks as water erodes through it?
[08:16:19] <ButterNoodle> the back fill of minerals is chert
[08:16:28] <amigojapan> Guest11: how do you know the Americans would not have taken over the world?
[08:16:34] <ButterNoodle> it can range from garbage to some pretty impressive stone tools
[08:16:48] <Guest11> regardless there was plenty of trade going to the americas before european colonization
[08:16:55] <amigojapan> I see ButterNoodle 
[08:17:08] <ButterNoodle> the objectively best chert in the world in about 30 miles away from me
[08:17:32] <ButterNoodle> this stuff was traded around the world <1000 AD before any explorers came here
[08:17:49] <Guest11> amigojapan in a very alternate history maybe - but the reason the europeans were able to do what they did was technological and organisational superiority
[08:17:58] <Guest11> so if europe was really lagging behind then yes
[08:18:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Numbers too.
[08:18:12] <Guest11> not really - the numbers came after
[08:18:29] <amigojapan> Guest11: also cause they brought illness
[08:18:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I mean that it'd have prevented the opposite from happening easily.
[08:18:35] <ButterNoodle> europe brought the small pox and venereal diseases.. thats how they won
[08:18:39] <Guest11> yes
[08:18:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And yes biowarfare is effective.
[08:19:02] <Guest11> anyway the illnesses are not as relevent since there was no way for the americas to catch up technologically
[08:19:10] <Guest11> look at the north american tribes
[08:19:24] <Guest11> look at china and the opium wars
[08:19:44] <ButterNoodle> my people tried to give them syphilis.. but not strong enough
[08:19:44] <Guest11> look at how long it took japan - if that was during an active invasion theyd be a colony
[08:20:08] <ButterNoodle> being surrounded by a body of water is helpful in protecting nationalism
[08:20:13] <Guest11> and japan and china were just a few hundred years behind not a few thousand
[08:20:15] <ButterNoodle> also a lot of pointy swords
[08:21:51] <Guest11> the campaigns in the americas - against the major civilizations however didnt even take much technological superiority - they were more similar to the viking invasion of england

[08:29:34] <ButterNoodle> yea they were looking to get away from taxation get rich quick in merica
[08:29:38] <Guest11> it was really hard to be a colonist in most periods
[08:30:42] <Guest11> but in the first several hundred years when slave ownership started it was do or die - which was probably why slavery caught on - there was no law and the economic value was substantial
[08:31:18] <Guest11> and then within a few generations the slaves were percieved as not human due to conditions
[08:32:52] <Guest11> and then it was in every structure in the colonies eg us - some of these families had gotten really rich and powerful and a lot of the population still depended on it economically - which is what made it so hard to root out
[08:33:36] <Guest11> did they get rich ButterNoodle?

[08:57:25] <klaxa> and at the end, most of the time the user doesn't care which language his software is waiting in
[08:57:55] <amigojapan> klaxa: I think you just have to be Turing compliant too be good enough
[08:58:00] <Guest11> no but to make that you need to know what youre doing - and knowing what youre dealing with helps
[08:58:20] <Guest11> haha turing compliant
[08:58:22] <redempt1on> I luv jiggin 2 mah cammie Streetfigher xxx hentais
[08:59:09] <Guest11> cammy is hot
[08:59:15] <Guest11> i concur
[08:59:54] <amigojapan> Many things are Turing compliant
[09:01:24] <MootPoot> seems like a LOT of FOSS stuff is  either C, C++ or python
[09:01:36] <Guest11> and java no
[09:02:07] <amigojapan> Yuck Java
[09:02:23] <Guest11> python is probably preferable if you like to just get on with it

[09:04:00] <redempt1on> I love to bate by taking bait from clickbait 
[09:04:01] <Guest11> apparently its a thing
[09:04:48] <klaxa> amigojapan: it can even be desirable to be not turing complete
[09:05:08] <klaxa> turing completeness is a blessing and a curse
[09:05:08] <amigojapan> redempt1on: I wonder if we can make a kind of fishing bait that makes a click sounds
[09:05:53] <Guest11> basically sometimes you just need a hammer
[09:05:57] <amigojapan> klaxa: well Turing machines have infinite memory
[09:06:15] <klaxa> NSO group used a buffer overflow in JBIG2 to build a turing complete virtual machine with just a NAND-gatter that could compare arbitrary addresses in memory
[09:06:27] <klaxa> oh, they used that to zero-click exploit iphones
[09:06:49] <klaxa> get a message, thumbnail gets generated, exploited
[09:07:24] <mixfix41> which year was that
[09:07:25] <klaxa> turing completeness does not take into account the infinity of memory
[09:07:43] <klaxa> it was uncovered either earlier this year or at the end of last year
[09:07:49] <klaxa> i think it was december last year
[09:07:54] <klaxa> could be wrong though
[09:07:56] <Guest11> "but i like thumbnails" "and now you have to pay"

[09:11:28] <klaxa> that's a sensible decision in these times
[09:11:39] <klaxa> i know a few people without smartphone
[09:12:03] <Guest11> used to have one about 10 years ago - piece of junk - never go another one
[09:12:41] <klaxa> i like smartphones
[09:12:55] <klaxa> it's like a computer in your pocket, i use it to chat with friends and listen to podcasts
[09:12:59] <klaxa> and watch youtube videos at night
[09:13:25] <klaxa> sometimes i even listen to music on it, if i run out of podcasts or need to do something that needs my attention but i'm not at my computer
[09:13:47] <Guest11> i dont know everything about them is just uncomfortable - screen is too small - touch screens are - well not my thing - and its slow - and its running a completely different architecture than my pc
[09:14:07] <klaxa> i used to run an ARM laptop
[09:14:15] <klaxa> that was closer to a smartphone than to a regular PC
[09:14:31] <klaxa> also these days smartphones aren't really that slow and it's hard to get one with a screen smaller than 5"
[09:14:51] <klaxa> oh yeah, i read a lot of twitter on my phone too
[09:14:54] <Guest11> 20" or larger or bust
[09:15:06] <klaxa> doesn't fit in my pocket
[09:15:13] <klaxa> and even my laptop is 13"
[09:15:17] <Guest11> but im usually at a computer so its not an issue for me
[09:15:27] <klaxa> everyone has different needs
[09:15:30] <Guest11> id understand it for travel
[09:15:35] <Guest11> and the like

[09:16:09] <klaxa> need dat internet
[09:16:25] <Guest11> sound like "addiction" aww
[09:16:33] <klaxa> yeap
[09:16:53] <klaxa> well i do most (all?) of my work on the computer
[09:17:08] <klaxa> at least the stuff i get paid for i do all digitally
[09:17:27] <klaxa> and i spend most of the day on the computer, even more so since rona
[09:17:28] <Guest11> i havent held a pen in years
[09:18:03] <klaxa> i have, whenever i need to sign something or whatever
[09:18:07] <Guest11> well thats not exactly true i did sign some documents a few months ago

[09:19:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Overflows leading to memory errors is just sad.
[09:21:17] <Guest11> most applications assume they have enough memory anyway

[09:36:18] <HubertFarnsworth> What project are you working on mootpoot?
[09:36:30] <Guest11> like go through some discussions to get an idea of the athmosphere
[09:40:44] <Guest11> it appears they have a chat here #django
[09:41:31] <amigojapan> That's likely for help developing in Django not developing for Django
[09:42:31] <Guest11> its to get an idea of the general environment - but yes checking the dev discussions would be more important
[09:43:32] <Guest11> amigojapan it was about the community athmosphere ie are they friendly hostile obnoxious how helpful are they to new contributors that sort of thing
[09:43:55] <Guest11> not the actual ins and outs of developing for or with django
[09:46:00] <Guest11> also they suggest to join the libera chat irc channel for contributors as well on their site

[17:00:31] <amigojapan> darkwitch: just verifying if it is really so expensive
[17:00:37] <Sapphirus> I've been doing this since my late teens. Keeping yourself hydrated is the best medicine to staying awake.
[17:00:52] <Sapphirus> Caffeine doesn't work as well as just drinking water.
[17:01:21] <Sapphirus> Although the key to it is you don't do it all the time. A balance needs to be struck.
[17:01:31] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: after 40. I was invited to an all nighter party, and I slept 3 days after that
[17:02:25] <Sapphirus> I can only imagine. From what I hear, you lose the ability to do these things as you age.
[17:02:49] <Sapphirus> So far I can still get by with what would be a nap to most people.

[17:16:36] <Sapphirus> I do, too, which is why this is something I tend not to regularly practice.
[17:16:59] <Sapphirus> Turning it into a regular thing is asking for trouble.
[17:18:01] <amigojapan> Alright
[17:19:27] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I can see how a disaster can easily disrupt sleep
[17:20:30] <Sapphirus> That makes sense, yeah. We did have a huge noreaster come through here earlier in the week and I had to shovel 2-3 feet of snow.

[18:24:02] <isekaijin> Another alternative is... do you have a link to just the porn?
[18:24:18] <Sadale> Me neither. That's an efficiency of 0.3%. a.k.a. very bad

[21:57:36] <isekaijin> Satin: Rust the language is actually cool. But, culturally, its users have the same webshitty tendency to make everything a micropackage.
[21:57:52] <Satin> And you just kind of threw cold water by suggesting he isn't that normal. Which I don't disagree with really, but you could have said that nicely smh
[21:57:58] <Satin> not normal != bad

[22:39:16] <Satin> emmeka: though I know a bit more about skincare/makeup in this regard than clothing fabrics per se
[22:39:31] <emmeka> the difference between clothes and computers is that clothes can be made sustainably and renewably, but they aren't, basically because sweat shops and cheap materials are available
[22:40:02] <Satin> emmeka: but my overall point is, while it's not something to ignore, it's not at all close to being something of an exceptionally climate emmisions sort of deal, relative to so many other things. nor is it unsolveable.

[22:45:36] <Satin> I was talking about the concept of fashion itself. I'm repeatedly making that distinction.
[22:45:40] <emmeka> Satin think of your critiques of art as it is, apply to fashion
[22:45:44] <Satin> no
[22:45:48] <emmeka> but you can't distinguish them
[22:45:52] <Satin> Yes you can.
[22:46:02] <emmeka> no? you're talking about a social concept as it exists.
[22:46:23] <Satin> Elaborate on how you can't? Various societies, even before the industrial revolution have had dress codes, traditional attire and so on
[22:46:45] <Satin> The original context (I don't remember if you saw it or not or when you joined) was criticizing the concept of fashion itself.
[22:46:57] <MootPoot> No
[22:47:14] <emmeka> this is about as useful as remarking that mining of diamonds existed before the industrial age and it was fine then, therefore the diamond industry is great
[22:47:17] <Satin> You can make critiques of the industry and I would certainly possibly agree with many of them, and for changing them. But equating it with the concept itself is bullshit.

[22:49:38] <Satin> Even the most staunch essays I've happened across that critique the industry or consumerism do not have insane ideas like "all fashion is consumerism" or whatever
[22:49:48] <Satin> Get your distinction straight here, I say.
[22:50:17] <emmeka> Satin I'm just very confused by the position. So you're actively trying to defend the idealized concept of the thing and separate it from the conditions it exists in and ignoring all actors involved in the industry of the thing
[22:50:20] <Satin> It's on the same level as saying, all energy generation is bad because the current state of it is dominated by monopolies and so on.
[22:50:28] <emmeka> do you want Adorno to cry?
[22:51:30] <Satin> a) Yeah, there's a distinction between the concept of something and the industry as it exists. I don't know what you're on about by equating the two as being one and the same. You'll have to do more than just casually suggest it's the same, run up against plenty of history and different cultures.
[22:51:55] <Satin> b) Where exactly is Adorno criticizing fashion? Lol. A consumer culture and industry is not the same thing as the concept, again.

[22:58:18] <Satin> nya to you as well
[22:58:42] <KatrinValerie> Now where do I get affordable sustainable fashion?
[22:59:00] <KatrinValerie> If the stuff lasts long, a higher initial investment is okay.
[22:59:12] <emmeka> nowhere.
[22:59:16] <Satin> KatrinValerie: lots of places that are like thrift-stores
[22:59:20] <Satin> Online
[22:59:21] <emmeka> incorrect.
[22:59:34] <KatrinValerie> That stuff breaks really quickly Satin 
[22:59:55] <KatrinValerie> You do not get anything but regular fast fashion in a thrift store these days.
[23:00:05] <Satin> KatrinValerie: I don't have personal experience with it because I haven't been buying much clothes, but friends I know have been buying fairly quality items just fine
[23:00:06] <KatrinValerie> And often you pay more for the brand than for the quality.
[23:00:15] <Satin> KatrinValerie: depends on which site
[23:00:30] <Satin> python2-pycparser
[23:00:32] <Satin> oops
[23:00:40] <KatrinValerie> Satin: I meant if you bought it new instead, so even when thrift stores have brand stuff, it breaks fast q.q
[23:01:47] <KatrinValerie> I got a really nice looking sweather for cheap, but looking at the yarn it will probably not last long

[23:16:38] <ButterNoodle> nice
[23:16:51] <ButterNoodle> I love it that Suzuka has been tuned up
[23:18:01] <emmeka> it hasn't, tho
[23:18:07] <Satin> hasn't*
[23:20:30] <KatrinValerie> Satin: I recommend using virtual envs
[23:20:50] <KatrinValerie> virtualenv_wrapper.sh is a great tool to make things simpler.
[23:21:10] <isekaijin> Does anyone else find it annoying how the amount of effort required to move, say, books from one room to another scales linearly with the amount of books?
[23:21:13] <KatrinValerie> It lets you maintain sperate python distributions to which you can install packages with pip
[23:21:39] <KatrinValerie> isekaijin: does it?
[23:21:44] <isekaijin> KatrinValerie: It does.
[23:21:49] <isekaijin> To move digital books from one directory to another, I just do ‚Äúmv /old/path/to/books/* /new/path/to/books‚Äù.
[23:21:59] <KatrinValerie> Oh digital books
[23:22:04] <KatrinValerie> I was thinking literal books
[23:22:14] <KatrinValerie> Digital books are called e-books imho
[23:22:43] <isekaijin> But for physical books, I have no choice but to move them in batches of bounded size.
[23:22:44] <Jigsy> That makes no sense, to be honest.
[23:22:50] <Jigsy> We don't call digital videos e-videos.
[23:22:53] <isekaijin> So the number of batches scales linearly with the number of books.
[23:23:18] <isekaijin> It's so fucking annoying.
[23:24:23] *** Suzuka sets mode: -b *!*@2607:fb90:627b:51c0:*$##anime-help
[23:24:54] <isekaijin> Also, physical objects need to be cleaned every now and then, even if you don't use them.
[23:24:59] <emmeka> damnit suzuka
[23:25:46] <Vohveli> Satin: you should also go for python 3 unless your specifically need 2 for something
[23:25:53] <Urchin[emacs]> I've started favoring ebooks, as I found I can set up the reader to make them easier on the eyes than physical books are on average
[23:26:14] <Urchin[emacs]> python2 has been removed from current Debian
