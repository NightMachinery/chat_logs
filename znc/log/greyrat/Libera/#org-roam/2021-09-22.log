[11:35:26] <konubinix> rdrg109: I assume you mean you want C-c C-o to find roam notes when it is called from outside of a roam note. Is that right?
[11:35:53] <konubinix> Because otherwise, from a roam note to another, C-c C-o already works out of the box, as answered by wetlize
[11:36:23] <konubinix> I added to his answer to make C-c C-o works from outside org-roam
[11:37:25] <konubinix> And if in the future you have some elisp code that used org-id-find and are annoyed by the fact it does not find roam notes, I provided a more deeply integrated way of making roam notes ids available from org-mode
[11:37:45] <konubinix> Yet, a more hacky way, because it is not officially (meaning, with hooks) supported by org-mode
[11:39:38] <konubinix> It helps a lot making a big web of knowledge, where org-roam is only the second brain part

[19:03:03] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: I managed to include any number of properties when creating a node. Here you have a minimal working example: http://0x0.st/-3RB.el and here you have the template that I'm currently using: http://0x0.st/-3RS.el
[19:03:20] *** Joins: srhm (~srhm@user/srhm)
[19:26:15] <Tisoxin> rdrg109: this won't work with new files, will it?
[19:33:48] <rdrg109> What do you mean with "new files"?
[19:33:58] <rdrg109> With those templates, whenever you use them, a new file is created.
[20:16:24] <Tisoxin> i mean that this won't insert ":CREATED: [â€¦]" to the property list at the beginning of the file, will it?
[20:16:43] <Tisoxin> Tisoxin: (or do sth similar)

[20:57:23] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: You are right. It will not insert it at the beginnnig of the file.
[20:57:42] <Tisoxin> :(
[20:58:11] <Tisoxin> till now my workflow is pretty much file-node based
[20:58:14] <rdrg109> The convention that I use for my notes is not to use the #+TITLE: variant for nodes, I just use headlines, because it's just the same.
[20:58:42] <Tisoxin> so do you use one single file?
[20:59:10] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: No, every single node I have is in a separated file.
[21:00:02] <rdrg109> But, I was saying that having "#+TITLE:" in the top level of your document is almost the same as having a single headline in the top level of your document and just create children headlines
[21:00:24] <Tisoxin> yeah
[21:00:36] <Tisoxin> though you still have the properties at the beginning, haven't you?
[21:00:51] <Tisoxin> so, that you're just ignoring them?
[21:01:35] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: I don't use the properties in the top level of the document. As I said, I have a single headline in the top level of my document and I use the properties of that headline.
[21:02:20] <Tisoxin> won't they get automatically generated?
[21:02:41] <Tisoxin> or did you patch org-roam heavily for your use-case?
[21:02:54] <Tisoxin> (in a non custom var way)
[21:02:56] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: Yes, they are automatically generated, but I just delete them. I was thinking in creating a feature request for disabling this.
[21:03:11] <rdrg109> For the time being, I deleted them manually.
[21:03:23] <Tisoxin> ok
[21:04:07] <rdrg109> If I don't delete them, I would have a lot of unnecessary nodes, but thanks to the flexibility of Org Roam, children headlines can also be nodes, so that's not a big deal.

[22:17:22] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: I was thinking on that and noticed that a big advantage of using #+TITLE (default template) is that you can export any of your nodes if necessary, Because of this, I think I will be using the default template instead of the convention that I had been using.
[22:17:52] <Tisoxin> yeah
[22:17:55] <rdrg109> I will let you know if I get to set any property in the top level of the document.
