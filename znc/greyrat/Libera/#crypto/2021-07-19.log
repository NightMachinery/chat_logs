[11:52:44] <riv> yes 
[11:54:53] <katp32> awesome; I'm trying to decrypt a sealed box using crypto_box_seal_open, but it always gives a nonzero return value, and I can't for the life of me figure out why; as far as I can tell everything is correct. here's (some of) the source if it's any help: https://leagueh.xyz/l/katherine.peeters/junk/crypto.c
[11:55:16] <katp32> is there like some sort of error codes that can give me information about *why* it's failing?

[11:58:14] <riv> aren these supposed to be different sizes?
[11:58:49] <riv> ah it gets bigger when you seal it, doesn't it
[11:59:20] <katp32> yeah, `#define SEALED_BOTTLE_SIZE BOTTLE_SIZE + crypto_box_SEALBYTES`
[11:59:59] <riv> btw this is unrelated to your question but it seems like you are kind of doing a MAC then encrypt type thing
[12:00:14] <katp32> MAC?
[12:00:28] <riv> so actualy in your case sign then encrypt
[12:00:43] <riv> but mac-then-encrypt vs encrypt-then-mac is the keyword to search about this
[12:02:03] <riv> https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/quickstart#do-i-need-to-add-a-signature-to-encrypted-messages-to-detect-if-they-have-been-tampered-with suggests that you may not need to do this
[12:03:29] <riv> I think the error must not be in that piece of code
[12:06:10] <katp32> yeah, I'm admittedly a bit confused; I did read that FAQ, so I'm not so much worried about integrity, it's just that I want a way for the recipient to verify who sent it, without allowing the sender's public key to be read without decrypting the box. sealed boxes use ephemeral keys so they don't do that on their own, maybe that means sealed boxes aren't the best way to go here?
[12:09:47] <katp32> my understanding is that the regular boxes require the recipient to have the sender's public key ahead of time in order to compute the shared key, or to pass the sender's public key in the clear, neither of which I really want to to if it can be avoided 
[12:10:06] <riv> if alice and bob are communicating via public/private keys, and alice recieves a valid encrypted message, she knows it was encrypted by either alice or bobs key
[12:11:55] <riv> so it is valid to add signing, to ensure it really was bob - and alice is not being (re)sent an old message alice encrypted
[12:13:17] <katp32> yeah, that makes sense, but alice requires bob's public key in order to compute the shared key used to encrypt/decrypt messages, no?
[12:13:34] <riv> yes
[12:14:48] <katp32> yeah, that's the problem, I'm working under the assumption that the recipient does not have the sender's public key (but I still want to sign the message just in case they do have the sender's public key and want to verify it)
[12:15:48] <riv> that doesn't make sense

[12:17:14] <katp32> and I don't want to pass the sender's public key in cleartext either; the "sealed boxes", I believe, get around this by just using an ephemeral key for the box, but then I still need a signature; ie, generating a random single use keypair and using that instead, and passing the ephemeral public key in the clear because it's single use so it doesn't matter
[12:17:28] <riv> crypto_box_seal_open is different to the nacl one that i'm used to, sorry
