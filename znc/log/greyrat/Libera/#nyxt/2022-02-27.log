[01:41:18] <hsanjuan[m]> I haven't checked the issues yet, but Nyxt 2.2.4 freezes sometimes for me, a bit out of the blue without doing anything special or having too many tabs. Can only be kill -9'ed.

[14:20:50] <ardon> Kind of an urgent question. Is nyxt's request-resource-hook only meant for URLs that are input through the prompt? I have a redirect rule, which, if I click on a link that opens on the same page won't redirect, but if I input the URL in the prompt it does redirect.
[14:32:04] <aartaka> ardon: Some clickable links are set via JavaScript and thus behave somewhat uncontrollable (at least on WebKit side). So yes, request-resource-hook does not see those, unfortunately.

[16:48:12] <ardon> Thank you aartaka. This issue happens on href links too though.
[16:55:10] <ardon> So I tried merging master as it had been a while and nfiles seems to have broken my configuration. I have my Nyxt configuration set up via Guix home and nyxt-init-file now points to /gnu/store instead of the intended ~/.config/nyxt/ as the latter is a symlink to the former. Is there a reason for going for the file truename here https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nfiles/blob/3a58d6876002962af263f4cebddeaca220c9f9e0/nfiles.lisp#L207?

[18:28:04] <lagash> aartaka: hmmm, what if Nyxt sniffed all network requests and redirected etc from there? like a MitM?

[19:00:38] <aartaka> ardon: Not sure there's a reason, but I can suppose that it's because symlinks are hard to handle in general.
[19:01:23] <aartaka> ardon: Feels like belonging to an issue in nfiles repo. Pierre (Ambrevar, not in IRC) should know better.
[19:01:33] <aartaka> Ah, disconnected.
