[05:45:35] <efex> fine, louipcD pay for those but what about the highway from your last trip?
[05:45:50] <TXDillo> efex> lol end taxes… so who pays for the road? << gas taxes, not income
[05:45:59] <efex> that stuff is wauy cheaper and easier withy a group buy
[05:46:05] <louipcD> hey thats still tax
[05:46:09] <efex> gas taxes are taxes
[05:46:18] <louipcD> better than income tax at least
[05:46:20] <TXDillo> yes, but it's for a specific purpose
[05:46:32] <edgar-rft> farting becomes expensive rather quickly
[05:46:41] <louipcD> tru
[05:46:58] <TXDillo> not just throwing part of your income at a government who wants to give it to support dictators overseas
[05:47:24] <efex> health care for example, car insurance… get one country saying “we agree to this”  vs bob getting a better deal than doug anf the guy diwn the street selling insurance
[05:47:30] <louipcD> yea but they'll just use gas tax for that too TXDillo 
[05:47:32] <louipcD> probably

[18:42:01] <nativetexan> took a second for that one get through my brain
[18:42:11] <Panther> In 1955, the Greater New York Association took over management of Jamaica Race Course along with Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park, and Saratoga Race Course and decided to undertake renovations to Aqueduct in South Ozone Park, the other track in the Greater Jamaica area. Jamaica took on the Big A dates during Aqueduct's four year renovation, after which it would be sold for redevelopment as a 
[18:42:11] <Panther> housing project.
[18:42:13] <Panther> awww

[20:57:58] <louipcD> you can write a 'program' in bash script and utilize all the tools written in whatever language to do things
[20:58:04] <Panther> Oh I know, nut I'd like to think I could if I wanted to, or if I needed to change one.
[20:58:32] <louipcD> tho writing anything too large in bash is actually harder than just doing it in a 'real programming language'
[20:58:40] <Panther> Are we discussing the various connotations of 'programming'?
[20:59:32] <louipcD> lol im done now. but yea in response to vb scripting in excel as not really programming
[21:00:14] <Panther> bash is very nice, and it does what it's supposed to do, and that is give an interactive shell that can execute logic, IPC, files, etc....
[21:00:45] <Panther> My favorite language is PERL, which being interpreted, is essentially a script.
[21:01:33] <Panther> PERL is the language of the Gods.
[21:01:38] <Panther> :)
[21:01:38] <louipcD> nothing bash should go over 200 lines or something imo
[21:01:58] <louipcD> why
[21:02:01] <Panther> 200 is puching it for a bash script
[21:02:20] <louipcD> i ported a small program from perl to c with very minimal changes
[21:02:30] <louipcD> was cool
[21:02:51] <Panther> Unless maybe you were controlling a bunch of servers and you needed to check on them every now and then with specific conditions, options, etc...
[21:03:41] <Panther> So, you set up a bach script to run out of cron every now and then to  make sure. *shrug*
[21:04:00] <Panther> C is ok.. I can live with C mostly.
