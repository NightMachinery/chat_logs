Once there is a hyphen there will always only be hyphens i.e. XOX--- can happen but it's impossible for XO-X-- to happen. I cannot figure a regex to match Xs and -s without a 0 between any, see: https://regex101.com/r/f7kbwE/1

[19:18:23] <rapha> sure thoug, you're not wrong. and not just talking about study colleagues - i've tried myself. with the russians it mostly took the form of making out with their girls, which beat anything i'd ever experienced before or since. the guys were all very nice, i just didn't have time left to get to know them. with the arabs it was nice but ultimately no friendships came out of it i think because of the economical
[19:18:26] <rapha> differences (less rich if not from the gulf, much more rich if from the gulf). but with the americans i can't even assign a reason why no friendship developed. it always seemed as though whenever there was some sort of shared interests or anything to build a connection on, they'd notice immediately and reatreat.

[20:19:54] <JohnDoe2> if you have lookaheads you can do a blank one (?=)

[20:20:21] <NoImNotNineVolt> let's see if that works...

[20:21:07] <JohnDoe2> re101-bongo-31 that's a tab character
[20:21:31] <NoImNotNineVolt> neither one of those do what i was expecting in this context. i think i'm just misunderstanding git's word-diff (and word-diff-regex).

[20:30:40] <JohnDoe2> NoImNotNineVolt yeah never tried to pass a different regex to word-diff
[20:31:30] <NoImNotNineVolt> my beef is that the default value, while resulting in pretty output, doesn't make for diffs which can be applied.
[20:32:03] <NoImNotNineVolt> e.g. "foo bar" vs "foo baz bar" gives the word diff "foo {+baz+} bar", which ignores that a second space was added.
[20:32:35] <NoImNotNineVolt> so if you try to apply that word-diff to an input of "foo bar", you get "foo bazbar". :'(

[20:36:11] <NoImNotNineVolt> changing the regex from the default [:space:] to . preserves whitespace in the diffs, but makes them a big uglier. e.g. "foo bar" vs "foo baz bar" becomes "foo ba{+z ba+}r".
[20:36:33] <NoImNotNineVolt> but at least they're apply-able then, so i'm gonna go with that. thanks :)

[22:03:23] <re101-beaver-23> youre helping me understand, its like the first time i try it
[22:04:01] <JohnDoe2> mkay, what have you tried so far/
[22:04:31] <re101-beaver-23> well <.*> does it but it selects the <comment> as well
[22:05:15] <JohnDoe2> yup that's because .* means "match anything except a line terminator, 0 ore more times, as many times as possible"
[22:05:44] <re101-beaver-23> well so how do i do it
[22:06:08] <JohnDoe2> well you think about it logically, read up online, trial and error... that's kinda how learning goes
[22:06:09] <re101-beaver-23> it says there are three options here like ''
[22:06:10] <re101-beaver-23> . 
[22:06:10] <re101-beaver-23> Matches any single character 
[22:06:11] <re101-beaver-23> * 
[22:06:11] <re101-beaver-23> Matches zero or more occurrences of the previous expression 
[22:06:11] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o rebot
[22:06:12] <re101-beaver-23> + 
[22:06:12] <re101-beaver-23> Matches one or more occurrences of the previous expression 
[22:06:12] *** rebot sets mode: +q-o *!*re101-bea@84.40.77.* rebot
[22:06:13] <rebot> 14re101-beaver-23: You've been muted for posting too many lines too quickly. You'll be unmuted in 0730s14.
[22:06:27] <JohnDoe2> those are not options, that's the explanation I gave you but on a token basis
[22:06:41] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o rebot
[22:06:42] *** rebot sets mode: -qo *!*re101-bea@84.40.77.* rebot
[22:06:53] <JohnDoe2> . is any non-line terminator, unless you turned on /s in your regex flags in which case it will match line terminators too
[22:07:09] <JohnDoe2> and * is the quantifier that does the "0 ore more times as many times as possible"
[22:07:50] <JohnDoe2> so everything in a regex is a command. "<" means "match a single < character at the current position in the string" to the regex engine
[22:08:05] <JohnDoe2> it processes your string from left to right, keep that in mind
[22:08:11] <re101-beaver-23> oh okay
[22:08:13] <JohnDoe2> so if you say match a < then anything, then a >
[22:08:21] <JohnDoe2> that would be ANY xml tag
[22:08:31] <JohnDoe2> you didn't narrow it down to what you want yet
[22:08:54] <re101-beaver-23> okay now i understand
[22:09:06] <JohnDoe2> so <comment> would match the opening tag. Since you want to keep it, there's multiple ways to preserve something but one easy way is to also capture it, so (<comment>)
[22:09:21] <JohnDoe2> then from that point on, what should come next? Think about what a comment might be allowed to contain.
[22:09:31] *** Joins: d1cor (~diego@179.63.242.100)
[22:09:59] <JohnDoe2> in your case it would be very convenient if we could say "match anything except another < or >" in which case that would look like this: [^<>]+
[22:10:58] <re101-beaver-23> so ^ is used for ''except''
[22:11:01] <re101-beaver-23> ?
[22:11:14] <JohnDoe2> so we have match and capture <comment> then match any character that is not a < or >, which, if there are no xml tags inside your comments, would get you to the next xml tag which hopefully is </comment>.
[22:11:43] <JohnDoe2> ^ is used to negate a character class, like [^a] means match anything except an "a". If you have a regular character class [a] it only matches an a
[22:12:03] <JohnDoe2> ^ is also used as an assertion for the beginning of input or line if /m flag is turned on
[22:12:24] <JohnDoe2> meaning if I say ^a that means "ensure it's the beginning of input/line, then match a single character a"
[22:12:41] <NoImNotNineVolt> only if /m? i thought ^ was always beginning of input (outside of [])
[22:13:03] *** Joins: re101-numbat-54 (~re101-num@49.130.130.21)
[22:13:06] <JohnDoe2> NoImNotNineVolt /m changes the behavior of ^ and $ to mean beginning of line, and end of line respectively. /m stands for multiline
[22:13:11] <re101-beaver-23> okay so yeah i got to the end and only </comment> is left
[22:13:36] <NoImNotNineVolt> i'm familiar with /m, i was just surprised that ^ would only have a special meaning for regex with /m modifiers.
[22:14:35] <NoImNotNineVolt> e.g. i thought ^ is also used as an assertion for the beginning of input/line even if /m flag is not turned on.

[22:15:34] <re101-beaver-23> then how would i finish the regex here
[22:15:51] <re101-beaver-23> it doesnt work with (</comment>)
[22:15:56] <JohnDoe2> re101-beaver-23 cool, now if you have xml tags inside your comments then the plot thickens. An option would be to make a greedy quantifier lazy, so that it doesn't go to the end of the file before backtracking one character at a time to find </comment>
[22:16:22] <JohnDoe2> so .* can be .*? which makes it change "as many times as possible" to "as few times as possible"
[22:16:42] <JohnDoe2> and if you follow that up with </comment> then it will instead advance one character at a time until it bumps into </comment>
[22:17:31] <JohnDoe2> NoImNotNineVolt input is not the same as line. Input can be a 20Gb file. Line is what's encased in \n or \r\n depending on the OS you use
[22:18:04] <re101-beaver-23> um i got lost here a bit
[22:18:08] <JohnDoe2> re101-beaver-23 well (</comment>) just says match and capture <, then /, then c, then o ... and so on
[22:18:26] <JohnDoe2> so if to doesn't work, why does it not work? where are you in the string?
[22:18:50] <JohnDoe2> there's also "Regex Debugger" on the left sidebar if you want to see what it does character by character
[22:19:18] <re101-beaver-23> okay so i did this
[22:19:20] <re101-beaver-23> (<comment>)[^<>]+.*?
[22:19:32] <re101-beaver-23> and what i get in the end is only the </comment>
[22:19:35] <re101-beaver-23> but not the first
[22:19:37] <JohnDoe2> can you explain to me in words what your regex means?
[22:20:02] <JohnDoe2> what you expect it to match, but in english, nice and simple
[22:20:26] <JohnDoe2> NoImNotNineVolt https://regex101.com/r/ipr9fo/1 toggle the /m flag to see the difference
[22:21:16] <re101-beaver-23> well the () makes the first comment not get selected and then the [^<>]+ selects the text
[22:21:48] <JohnDoe2> () just captures what it encases and assigns an ID to it to reference later ( starts at 1 )
[22:22:02] <JohnDoe2> [^<>]+ --- what kind of text does this select?
[22:22:20] <re101-beaver-23> is there like another way of doing it tho
[22:22:30] <re101-beaver-23> or its specific and can only be done one way
[22:22:56] <JohnDoe2> regex is a programming language, so just like anything else, there's multiple ways of doing the same thing
[22:23:29] <re101-beaver-23> so what is the most basic way of doing this task
[22:24:00] <JohnDoe2> I don't know 🤷‍♂️ what we're doing above is pretty basic
[22:24:59] <re101-beaver-23> probably yeah but its just very different from the other languages that I've tried learning
[22:25:14] <JohnDoe2> yeah everything has a syntax
[22:26:13] <re101-beaver-23> okay so let me see 
[22:26:43] <re101-beaver-23> oh so you need spaces after the () 
[22:27:49] <JohnDoe2> why?
[22:27:59] <re101-beaver-23> or maybe not sorry
[22:28:07] <re101-beaver-23> was just trying to see how it would work
[22:28:14] <JohnDoe2> spaces means spaces to regex :)
[22:28:22] <JohnDoe2> if you type a space, it will match a space character in your string
[22:28:33] <JohnDoe2> it means "match a single space character"
[22:28:56] *** Quits: han-solo (~hanish@user/han-solo) (Quit: leaving)
[22:29:10] <JohnDoe2> everything is a command, there's no mystery there, no required ; at the end of a line or nonsense of that sort.
[22:29:52] <re101-beaver-23> okay im trying to get the hang of it
[22:30:11] <JohnDoe2> focus on simply giving it the commands in the right order. Say you want to match cranberry and cranapple, you know that it should first match cran, since it's common, so tell it /cran/. Cool, now you're after n and before berry and apple. So 2 options. 
[22:31:39] <JohnDoe2> The "or" operator is a pipe |, so you tell it /cran(berry|apple)/ and it will alternate between berry and apple, since the pipe is enclosed in the capture group. If you didn't have the capture group, it would still mean "match what's before |, OR, what's after |" but without boundaries. So either match cranberry or apple if /cranberry|apple/
[22:33:17] <re101-beaver-23> okay i seem to delete the text from ''needs to be deleted''
[22:33:24] <re101-beaver-23> but the ''this'' stayst

[22:35:03] <re101-beaver-23> okay see
[22:35:32] <JohnDoe2> cool so do you understand .*? 
[22:36:21] <re101-beaver-23> yes 
[22:36:31] <JohnDoe2> what is the command you gave the engine by using that?
[22:36:35] <JohnDoe2> in english
[22:36:55] <NoImNotNineVolt> JohnDoe2: indeed, but ^ has a special non-literal meaning in either case, i thought.
[22:37:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> but indeed, input is not the same as line. but you said "input/line", and i was just sticking to that :P
[22:37:52] * NoImNotNineVolt shuts up at the risk of being seen as pedantic :P
[22:38:06] <JohnDoe2> NoImNotNineVolt it's never literal unless inside a character class, but not in position 1, so [abc^]
[22:38:33] <NoImNotNineVolt> or escaped :P
[22:38:57] <NoImNotNineVolt> but ya, okay, that's what i thought. thanks! :)
[22:39:00] <JohnDoe2> uh huh. ^ is a special character, but its behavior can be modified with the /m flag. That's all I said, not that /m makes ^ mean or not mean something to the engine
[22:39:04] <JohnDoe2> cool 👍
[22:39:12] <NoImNotNineVolt> ya, i misunderstood.
[22:40:19] <JohnDoe2> well my English is not very good looking so ... 🤷‍♂️

[23:34:46] <Emil> Hey
[23:35:47] <JohnDoe2> 👋
[23:35:55] <Emil> Would "(?>.*\.)?facebook.com" be a "reasonable" way to match a domain and all its subdomains?
[23:36:46] <Emil> Sure it's not "correct" in that .* can match elements not allowed in a host if I'm not mistaken
[23:37:05] <Emil> but it's reasonable enough imho
[23:37:14] <JohnDoe2> but why the atomic group?
[23:37:23] <Emil> JohnDoe2: I don't care about that capture group
[23:37:37] <Emil> sure I could just write (.*\.)?
[23:37:52] <JohnDoe2> I guess that's a way to exclude part of a match too :D
[23:38:17] <JohnDoe2> there's also \K if PCRE, or variable lookbehind if you're lucky with .net and stuff
[23:38:28] <Emil> exclude?
[23:38:48] <Emil> Isn't the excluding achieved by negative/positive lookahead
[23:38:55] <JohnDoe2> yeah nothing before facebook.com will match because .* is greedy, and the atomic group does not allow backtracking there
[23:38:59] <Emil> and (?>group) is included in the full match still
[23:39:08] <Emil> oh
[23:39:10] <Emil> Hmm
[23:39:14] <Emil> What's the correct way then?
[23:39:21] <JohnDoe2> there's no correct way
[23:39:41] <JohnDoe2> many ways to achieve the same thing so if you say you don't care about whatever is before facebook.com then so be it
[23:39:57] <Emil> I meant
[23:40:04] <Emil> I don't care about having access to the individual capture group
[23:40:10] <Emil> I want the full match, though
[23:40:26] <JohnDoe2> then you can use a non-capturing group (?:...)
[23:40:50] <JohnDoe2> and maybe instead of . use \S to restrict to non-whitespace
[23:41:01] <Emil> ah it was that and not ?>
[23:41:15] <Emil> I thought I had seen that in regex101 instead of the ?>
[23:41:18] <JohnDoe2> (?>...) is a thing, it's called an atomic group
[23:41:59] <Emil> JohnDoe2: thank you!
