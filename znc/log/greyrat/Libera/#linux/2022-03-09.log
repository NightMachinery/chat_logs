[01:17:04] <euouae> hodapp yes, but I don't want to have a single library contain both f() and f_c(). For one thing, I want small libraries, so if you're not using f() (or if you're not using f_c()), I don't want them there
[01:17:19] <ayecee> that prevents the go installation, which in turn makes the makepkg fail
[01:17:26] *** Joins: ws2k3 (znc@vps.freegamehosting.eu)
[01:17:32] <hodapp> but if f_c() calls f(), it needs that there anyway

[01:17:41] <ayecee> euouae: you don't need two names for the function.
[01:17:42] <hodapp> the size of the C wrapping function should be quite minimal

[10:43:07] <Haxxa> Hi Guys, So I'm running udhcpd (busybox dhcp server) using "udhcpd -f /etc/udhcpd.conf". I see "udhcpd (v1.24.1) started" but when I run netstat via "netstat -tul" I can't see it listening. Any advice how to diagnose this?

[13:19:45] <ZAJDAN1> I do not want to extract the tar on destination
[13:19:53] <geirha> oh wait, you said you can't use ssh, but then you told rsync to use ssh anyway. Sounds like you want rsync to use the rsync protocol instead

[13:22:44] <RayTracer> and it can just be omitted, as that's the default

[16:43:59] <merpaderp> is that rule of thumb about swap = ram size still holds true?
[16:44:04] <merpaderp> or was it actually swap twice the RAM?
[16:44:25] <Elw3> Do you need swap?
[16:44:39] <merpaderp> in my limited linux exp swap is great, because I have a habit of leaving running things I dont much need and it swaps those soon enough.

If your download speed is less than 25 Mbps, the show or movie won't stream in 4K HDR. Higher speeds will provide more consistent 4K HDR streaming. ananke,

[23:23:25] <Dan39> running a java program that wants to connect to serial port, the java program uses a library( https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/nrjavaserial ) that unpacks "native code" to /tmp, but with recent security requirement changes i've made /tmp mounted with noexec, so now that doesn't work
[23:23:57] *** Quits: lxsameer (~lxsameer@user/lxsameer) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:24:51] <Dan39> any ideas on best fix? easiest thing is just tell people to shuv it and mount /tmp exec haha, other option is to revert back to the older version of library that puts the separate "native code" file into java/lib/amd64/
[23:25:24] <Dan39> my other thought is to try to get that library to unpack the native code file to a different location
[23:25:48] <Dan39> not sure if that would mean telling java to use a different tmp directory or if it would be possible for just that file
