[09:09:49] <arcturus> what is the most popular sport in japan?

[11:35:46] <amigojapan> Yeah I will take a look in a few minutes thanks Maxdamantus
[11:36:33] <Maxdamantus> that Wikipedia article actually mentions "paraconsistent logics" which might still work without the law of contradiction, though I haven't looked into them.

[11:45:02] <Maxdamantus> It makes use of the law of contradiction.
[11:45:04] <amigojapan> Not confining
[11:45:13] <amigojapan> Right
[11:46:55] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: I don't think I am yet willing to give up on the idea of true and false being a thing
[11:47:27] <amigojapan> It has been such a useful tool down the ages
[11:48:25] <Maxdamantus> Give up true/false as in embrace intuitionistic logic?
[11:49:16] <amigojapan> Well I don't think I really understand well what it is, so no, I won't yet embrace it
[11:52:11] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: if I give up on true/false like lalia does, I can't even say that "we are both using computers now"is a true statement. Which it obviously is
[11:55:28] <Maxdamantus> Dunno what lalia's position, is, but in intuitionistic logic that can still be deduced, it's just not really "true" as opposed to "false".
[11:56:31] <Maxdamantus> You just don't have the true/false logic values.
[11:57:20] <Maxdamantus> unlike in classical/boolean logic, where you're just applying operations to true/false values.
[11:59:53] <DivFlux> @pussipupu As of right now, before really diving in, I take it to mean a kind of global synchronization/capacity for real time reaction to any event in any part of the world.

[12:09:35] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: yeah but I could not follow the axioms
[12:12:21] <Maxdamantus> I just see it in terms of type systems. Haven't really spent a lot of time myself looking at descriptions of logic myself in other contexts.
[12:12:46] <Maxdamantus> But I like type systems and I can see how they correspond to logic.
[12:13:38] <amigojapan> Ok
[12:14:01] <Maxdamantus> Ultimately a type system in a programming language is just stating truths about things in that language.
[12:14:23] <Maxdamantus> eg, the type system lets you prove that some function returns an int.
[12:14:34] <amigojapan> Yup
[12:14:47] <Maxdamantus> or that it returns a string if given a string and returns an int if given an int.
[12:15:19] <amigojapan> That I can follow "no such thing as false"does not make sense to me
[12:15:59] <Maxdamantus> So depending on how advanced the type system is, you can express various propositions in the type system. C lets you state/prove the former ("returns an int") but not the latter ("return type is the same as input type")
[12:18:19] *** Joins: Keter (~Keter@user/keter)
[12:19:17] <Maxdamantus> Well, so if you look at type systems, you express propositions as types and you prove them by showing that you can construct a value with that type.
[12:19:47] <Maxdamantus> so something (a proposition, aka a type) is "true" if you can construct a value with that type (aka proposition).
[12:20:15] <Maxdamantus> and from there, it doesn't really make sense to have something that is "false".
[12:21:28] <Maxdamantus> note that there isn't actually a particular "true" value in that system.
[12:21:58] <Maxdamantus> you just have lots of propositions that are considered to be "true" just because you can come up with a value of that type/proposition.

[12:34:00] <Maxdamantus> It is not true that `f` accepts a float.

[13:57:27] <lalia> I'm not fussed about it, but amigojapan has misrepresented my position to a degree inasmuch as I have reached no conclusions such that I could be appropriately characterized as having given up on anything as yet. That's the whole idea behind the condition occupied by a skeptic: we're still investigating.
[13:58:04] <lalia> And I did totally mention a fondness for intuitionistic approaches to formal languages. :)
[13:58:45] <amigojapan> lalia: I took a look but could not follow it
[13:59:23] <lalia> No worries. The trick to understanding skepticism includes realizing that there isn't really a sales pitch to be convinced by. :D
[13:59:34] <lalia> It either works for you or it doesn't.
[13:59:50] <lalia> Either way, there should be little to no controversy.

[14:01:16] <arryana> i'd offer you coffee, but i imagine it's either too early or too late there for that
[14:01:23] <lalia> amigojapan: you'd be an odd sort of skeptic considering the number of beliefs you seem to hold to. :P

[14:02:05] <arryana> how'd it go/
[14:02:17] <lalia> Well enough, just long. :)
[14:02:22] <arryana> good
[14:02:23] <lalia> Thanks for asking.
[14:02:25] <amigojapan> lalia: skeptics can have beliefs they start to trust after years of being sketical.
[14:02:28] <lalia> How're y'all doing today?
[14:02:36] <arryana> i have vast respect for caterers.  that's a hell of a job.
[14:02:44] <lalia> amigojapan: on what reading of skepticism?
[14:02:50] <arryana> the most i've ever cooked for by myself is 200, and that took days
[14:03:50] <amigojapan> lalia: just the need to study other fields and not just take them on blind faith is what defines a skeptic
[14:05:11] <lalia> This is very much not the case for the so-called Indian skeptics who eschew the aquiring or holding beliefs. And Hellenistic skepticism tends to either deny the possibilty of certainy in any beliefs or there's a denial of aquiring and forming committments to particular lifestyles.
[14:06:14] <amigojapan> lalia: I don't have certainty, just a small about of conviction
[14:06:33] <amigojapan> lalia: I am certain of nothing
[14:06:52] <lalia> Sextus Empiricus literally argues against the idea that one who holds a belief remains a skeptic by virtue of having replaced the pursuit of inquiry in one or more areas with an affirmation of some kind: this would be consistent with your brand of dogmatism for him.
[14:07:11] <lalia> It's not about certainty really.
[14:07:25] <lalia> That's more for the attitude of incredulity.
[14:07:59] <arryana> i don't think you'd find anyone who would define a skeptic as someone who picks and chooses what they want to believe
[14:08:13] <arryana> didn't you say you believe in heaven because you want to see your parents there someday/
[14:08:28] <arryana> that's... pretty much the opposite of a skeptical mindset
[14:09:44] <amigojapan> No I did not say that
[14:09:55] <lalia> It's a loosely associated thesis for skepticism but beliefs are a difficult point to address for the tradition given that believing is arguably at the center of the issue unerlying a skeptic's lack of tranquility.
[14:09:57] <amigojapan> I said it is a good psychological tool
[14:10:13] <arryana> so you don't believe there's a heaven/
[14:10:33] <amigojapan> No I just think it is a good tool

[14:11:34] <lalia> For the Greeks too.
[14:12:05] <amigojapan> Ok lalia let me look that up
[14:12:10] <lalia> We might be talking about the same things but using different language.
[14:12:18] <lalia> It's an important thing to clarify tho.
[14:12:45] <lalia> My understanding is that it's critical for a skeptic to refer to opinions and accepted customs rather than aquiring and holding beliefs.
[14:15:19] <arryana> that's probably the clearest definition i've ever heard of it
[14:15:42] <lalia> And though my understanding may be flawed... these would correspond to deeply nuanced and detailed flaws, as I've been building a background in these topics for a few years now and it's getting pretty serious. :) If I've misunderstood then I must be exceptionally confused by the feedback I get from peers. :P
[14:16:00] <amigojapan> lalia: that sounds dogmatic. You can have experiences in life which tell you what things to believe which seem rational. Let me give you an example
[14:16:03] <lalia> Happy to figure that shit out too. :D
[14:16:36] <lalia> amigojapan: Are you reading any texts on this or are you... shooting from the hip here, so to speak?
[14:16:51] <amigojapan> lalia: solipsism can't be disproved. The only way to get out of it is to have faith that reality is real
[14:17:00] <arryana> a skeptic recognizes that while such things -seem- rational, they aren't

[14:17:33] <lalia> Sextus Empiricus explicitly explains his view of dogmatism in the first book of Outlines and it deals very clearly with forming and holding beliefs as a critical issue, amigojapan. :)
[14:17:42] <lalia> I'm speaking from the perspective of an ancient tradition.
[14:18:25] <lalia> So there must be some confusion here.
[14:19:04] <lalia> What makes you think this issue with belief relates to solipsism?
[14:19:05] <amigojapan> lalia: I am not a follower of an ancient tradition of sketics.i an just someone that questions everything
[14:20:06] <arryana> not everything.  just everything you haven't decided to believe in.
[14:20:10] <arryana> that's not a skeptic.
[14:20:24] <amigojapan> lalia: how do you escape from living a life of solipsism?it can't be disproved. It could be true. Yet it is necessary to put it aside by faith
[14:20:43] *** Joins: evolvidle (~evolv@user/evolv)
[14:21:09] <lalia> So you'd be calling yourself a skeptic but treating the stance as idiosyncratic to your understanding in that case. It'd be like saying you're a Christian but you believe in Allah and deny the divinity of Christ with no support for formal religious organization.
[14:21:16] <lalia> So... not at all a Christian. :P
[14:21:22] <arryana> well, i'm out.  i see no point trying to discuss something when one side refuses to use terms as they really are.
[14:22:03] <amigojapan> arryana: everything I have decided to believe in I have doubted too.i have analysed. And decided it is better to believe in some things
[14:22:40] <lalia> amigojapan: a skeptic isn't interested in the proof for or against solipsism because the situation is a non-issue for one in pursuit of ataraxia (tranquility) instead of certainty.
[14:23:20] <amigojapan> lalia: have you doubted skepticism?
[14:23:25] <arryana> i understand that you have words to excuse everything you think and do, amigo.  but they have very little bearing with the reality of how those words are used in a philosophical context.  so there is no point discussing with you.
[14:23:30] <lalia> Sextus says those who seem to say we have trouble taking ordinary action or living in a community must have not been listening to what we say. :D

[14:27:09] <amigojapan> You just said "it is a tradition with words
[14:27:55] <lalia> Jesus... amigojapan, have you been participating sincerely? I've been explaining this "tradition" is actually a facade for the lack of a stance.
[14:28:12] <lalia> It's actually explained in painfully clear detail in the texts. :D
[14:28:41] * lalia sings -- *reading is handy like thaaaaat.*
[14:29:58] <lalia> Ancient skepticism can be characterized as being about philosophy rather than itself constituting any particular philosophical outlook.
[14:30:08] <lalia> It's more of a metaphilosophical project, really.
[14:30:39] <amigojapan> lalia: ok I think we disagree on what is the definition of "skeptic"
[14:31:14] <lalia> Sure, but you'd be at risk of being wrong more than me in this case because my take appears to be in agreement with prominent scholarship.
[14:31:25] <lalia> So I'm all shrugs. :)

[14:33:48] <amigojapan> lalia: I think I go now by a dictionary definition. We can check that. They often have more than once definition
[14:33:52] <lalia> I've been working on developing my own contribution to the scholarship, so it helps to hear that I'm being clear. At least for some folks. :P
[14:36:01] <lalia> Even Wittgeinstein would insist on you contrasting your ordinary language approach against more historical and technical characterizations of the term in order to develop the best understanding of the activity or concept.
[14:36:07] <amigojapan> lalia: I think I mostly fall under definition 2b https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism
[14:36:07] <ro-bot-o> [url] Skepticism | Definition of Skepticism by Merriam-Webster | www.merriam-webster.com
[14:36:30] <lalia> amigojapan: philosophical inquiry seems to insist that you go beyond merely refering to a dictionary definition for your pursuit.
[14:36:44] <lalia> That's just not enough, IMO.
[14:36:57] <amigojapan> lalia: I am willing to
[14:37:12] <lalia> Well, I've just done it for you to some degree. :P
[14:37:20] <lalia> Only you appear unwilling to engage.
[14:37:52] <amigojapan> lalia: well I am not a skeptic if I go by your definition i agree
[14:38:28] <amigojapan> Probably not interested in becoming one
[14:38:40] <lalia> That's probably the idea.
[14:39:01] <lalia> I'm not looking to convert anyone, so please don't read me that way.
[14:39:12] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:39:19] <lalia> A skeptic is ostensibly not one voluntarily.
[14:39:57] <lalia> We simply are like this naturally: it isn't an asked for or sought condition for the most part.
[14:40:08] <lalia> That's arguably very rare.
[14:40:14] <lalia> Or simply not a thing.
[14:41:43] <amigojapan> lalia: well I have been using a more commoner easy of using the word. That is the disagreement. I don't claim to bring to any philosophical school of skepticism
[14:45:05] <lalia> Alright, so here's the rub in that case: conflating the attitude of being skeptical with the idea of being a skeptic is an easy thing to confuse and leads to one or more critical misunderstandings. The main issue is that you mean to say that your beavior involves questioning a lot of the time and in this respect you can be said to be skeptical.
[14:45:31] <lalia> It's a distinct condition from being a skeptic tho, wouldn't you think? Subtle tho it may be, this appears to be an important distinction.
[14:48:26] <amigojapan> In commoner language I disagree. Skeptic is someone that questions everything. The philosophical school of thought it unrelated
[14:48:56] <krb> where does a true skeptic stand on astral projection?
[14:49:07] <lalia> That doesn't make sense, amigojapan. But do you. :)
[14:49:27] <amigojapan> I think what you belong to lalia is a philosophical school of thought called skepticism
[14:49:29] <lalia> krb: Sounds fun? No idea.
[14:49:39] <lalia> amigojapan: you're wrong. Straight up.
[14:50:09] <lalia> I occupy a metaphilosophical position consistent with the ancient tradition of skepticism.
[14:50:24] <lalia> contemporary skepticism can be characterized as an epistemic project.
[14:50:32] <lalia> Even that sounds different from what you're on about tho.

[14:51:37] <amigojapan> Ok lalia day that in like 2 or 3 words and I can agree
[14:52:26] <lalia> Descartes characterization of skepticism at its most radical sounds like solipsism, but it can be arbitrarily defeated in a number of ways including simply asking whether there's anything important about the thought experiment in the first place. :P
[14:52:41] <lalia> amigojapan: I don't know what you're asking or demanding rather.
[14:52:43] <amigojapan> lalia: I am askeptic by layman's terms tho
[14:53:14] <lalia> Also, this isn't something I'm after: convincing you of anything. You're simply misrepresenting something I spend a lot of time on and care a lot about.

It's good that you find it rewarding, amigojapan. He makes a few moves in that text which require what we might call leaps of faith and they require investing in for the text to really make sense for anyone.

[15:02:11] <krb> somehow i consider pyrrhonism more "skeptic" than skepsism

[15:06:38] <lalia> amigojapan: no, nor could this be implied by what I've been saying, I don't think. I'm saying skepticism for someone like Sextus Empiricus (our main historical source for the idea out of Greece at this point) is meant to be something like cognative therapy for those in pursuit of philosophical inquiry who've arrived at no conclusions.

[16:25:04] <krb> i'm trying to figure out the point of it
[16:25:06] <raincomplex> from my perspective, 'astral projection' is a fancy name for 'using your imagination'
[16:25:14] <raincomplex> and i don't mean that in a derogatory way
[16:25:17] <amigojapan> Dreaming is natural for humans. But many people seem not to remember their dreams

[17:36:19] <arcturus> i almost never remember my dreams
[17:36:24] <evolv> amigojapan, that's a blessing
[17:36:28] <evolv> middle school was awful
[17:36:48] <evolv> arcturus, sometimes when I meditate I recall a long forgotten dream
[17:36:56] <amigojapan> arcturus: I remember like 3dreams per day
[17:37:26] <arcturus> idk what that says about the state of my brain
[17:37:44] <evolv> most people don't remember the bulk of their dreams
[17:37:51] <evolv> including me
[17:37:59] <arcturus> ah, thats good then
[17:38:06] <amigojapan> evolv: instead of going to middle school I want to a programming school for adults. Later I took the GED and entered college
[17:38:12] <evolv> I remember a very small subset of actual dreams
[17:38:27] <evolv> sometimes I remember that I did dream, but zero memory of the dream, itself
[17:38:54] <evolv> remembering dreams are somewhat of a fluke
[17:38:57] <amigojapan> arcturus: I remember the dreams for a while but unless I write them down I tend to forget them quickly
[17:39:18] <evolv> amigojapan, so you bypassed the nightmare years altogether
[17:39:35] <amigojapan> evolv: highschool too
[17:40:10] <amigojapan> evolv: my parents let me do it my way
[17:40:42] <evolv> programming school is a rare opportunity
[17:40:51] <amigojapan> Yeah
[17:41:45] <evolv> although it's common enough in a small subset of kids to take the GED to finish a bit earlier to go to college, or finish the same time as other kids, but take up unique learning opportunities

[17:42:43] <amigojapan> evolv: I did not even study for the GED. It was easy cause all I had to do was sure essays even about math
[17:43:05] <evolv> graduating high school was easy, too
[17:43:10] <evolv> all you had to do was breathe
[17:43:13] <evolv> lol
[17:43:15] <amigojapan> Write not sure
[17:43:24] <amigojapan> True
[17:45:32] <amigojapan> evolv: so I actually have 2 degrees. One from when I was little programmer analyst degree, and a software engineer degree from college
[17:46:25] <evolv> nice :D
[17:46:37] <amigojapan> :)
[17:46:42] <kmh> evolv,  that very much depends with qwhich grad school and prof you end up
[17:47:09] <kmh> oh nvm that
[17:47:12] <amigojapan> evolv: but it seems my unconscious would have wanted to go to middle school
[17:47:27] <evolv> kmh, yeah, just high school
[17:47:29] <kmh> i read grad school rarther than graduating highschool
[17:48:14] <evolv> amigojapan, it's just that useless "missing out" feeling
[17:48:15] <kmh> yeah i imagine in most highscholl attending is in doubt sufficient, so almost the only way to fail is dropping out
[17:48:25] <evolv> middle school was the worst experience K-12
[17:48:35] <evolv> kids were mean as fuck, I was awkward as fuck
[17:48:54] <evolv> high school was pretty uneventful
[17:49:05] <evolv> boring, but not bad
[17:49:10] <kmh> it's a bit different here as they have grade restriction and there is a general exam at the end (which you need to pass)
[17:49:42] <evolv> exams are worthless
[17:49:52] <evolv> not within classes, they're good checkpoints
[17:50:00] <evolv> cumulative exams, standardized exams
[17:50:17] <kmh> dunno
[17:50:19] <evolv> those don't have any real bearings on knowledge acquired
[17:50:43] <kmh> they provide some form of "comparable" assessment
[17:51:08] <kmh> how useful that ultimately is , is another matter
[17:51:41] <amigojapan> evolv: I had a really good time at the programming school. I really enjoyed the studying and I made friends with the proffesors and stayed talking about computers after class every day
[17:51:45] <evolv> what they assess are ability to waste time studying what doesn't provide value other than an arbitrary filter

[17:52:25] <amigojapan> evolv: but I suck at some kinds of math I missed out
[17:52:43] <kmh> question is whether there is an alternative metric that would work for the masses
[17:53:00] <evolv> apparently, I later found I was in a risk group as my parents don't have bachelor degrees
[17:54:09] <evolv> amigojapan, even going to school for software engineering? What math did you miss out on?
[17:54:15] <evolv> I only had up to calculus 1
[17:54:53] <evolv> kmh, colleges attempt to weigh more than standardized exams and grades in school, but it has been ineffective
[17:54:59] <amigojapan> evolv: calculus and the such
[17:55:05] <evolv> still largely biased to those with socioeconomic advantages
[17:55:19] <evolv> volunteer experience, job experience, college essay
[17:55:40] <evolv> socioeconomic advantage is one component, but not heavily weighed in the whole
[17:55:53] <kmh> evolv, i know that they use additional measures, but there suitabily looks equally dubious to me
[17:56:16] <evolv> fair quantifiable measurements don't exist
[17:56:37] <kmh> evolv, not to mention they make the correlation with wealth AND PARENTS IN SOME REGARDS EVEN WORse
[17:57:03] <kmh> i mean that is what got you the career management for kids in kindergarden
[17:57:04] <evolv> correlation with wealth and parents worse?
[17:57:27] <evolv> as in facilitating greater divide?
[17:57:32] <kmh> and that kids pick hobbies and interests based on what looks good for their college resume
[17:57:48] <kmh> which imho is not a good development at all
[17:57:53] <evolv> amigojapan, I know that CS degrees typically are a minimum of calc 3 and one stats class
[17:58:01] <evolv> some colleges require diffeq
[17:58:18] <amigojapan> evolv: but I did not take CS
[17:58:36] <evolv> hmm, software engineering standalone degree?
[17:58:46] <evolv> but you had more than calc 1 still
[17:59:02] <kmh> evolv,  i'm not suggesting a particular fair assessment exists, i'm just saying i haven't seen anything that strikes me really better than exams/tests
[17:59:12] <evolv> kmh, yeah, that's exactly the case with my nephew in law
[17:59:13] <amigojapan> I never studied calculus ever
[17:59:40] <pussipupu> Not even in secondary school before uni?
[17:59:45] <kmh> amigojapan, goodness gracious
[18:00:01] <pussipupu> Gosh that's a different system from what I'm used to
[18:00:36] <amigojapan> pussipupu: I went to a programming school instead of going to secondary school
[18:00:42] <evolv> amigojapan, ohhh, you missed out on calculus altogether
[18:00:45] <evolv> I get it now
[18:00:52] <amigojapan> pussipupu: a school for adults
[18:00:56] <evolv> I had to take calculus 1 three times
[18:01:00] <amigojapan> Yup
[18:01:06] <evolv> with a good professor, I realized how easy calc 1 is
[18:01:20] <kmh> well i guess you could/can teach the needed calculus on the side (without providing deeper understanding of it, just practical hands on knowledge as needed)
[18:01:33] <evolv> my first professor was good, but I took on too many courses and couldn't balance
[18:01:51] <evolv> the second professor was a nightmare
[18:02:04] <kmh> but otherwise i don't see how you can do software engineering without any calculus knowledge
[18:02:21] <evolv> I had a faster paced summer class that was four days a week for calc 1 and a solid professor, that did the trick
[18:02:59] <evolv> I also think my professor subtly liked me because of my last name
[18:03:15] <kmh> lol
[18:03:27] <kmh> now we would need to know the name :-P
[18:03:37] <evolv> it's more to do with ethnicity
[18:03:50] <evolv> He was from Malta, I have Sicilian roots
[18:04:33] <kmh> mobster math :-P
[18:04:39] <evolv> Mediterranean bias is a real thing
[18:05:09] <evolv> first thing a good friend of mine asked me when we met, "where are you from"
[18:05:21] <evolv> "my family came from Italy"

[23:32:51] <l554> audrey: If you are here, I have a question for you about arguments built upon semantics:
[23:33:01] <l554> The question is: Are philosophical arguments (e.g. by Descartes, Moore, Nozick, academia et al), useful if they rely on a _particular definition_ of validity/knowledge/truth? Because they are not useful when paired with other definitions/understandings of those terms.
[23:33:16] <l554> For example: In the online philosophy course I am taking, it was stated that: You have knowledge of P if and only if:
[23:33:34] <l554> ---- (1) P is true (2) you are sure that P (3) you are justified in being sure that P (4) you didn't infer P from a false belief (5) if P hadn't be true, you wouldn't have believed it (6) your beliefs on these matters are mostly accurate (7) you believe P by a reliable method
[23:33:52] <l554> I responded with the Merriam Webster definition of knowledge: [knowledge](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/knowledge) noun | knowl·edge | \ ˈnä-lij \
[23:33:52] <ro-bot-o> [url] Knowledge | Definition of Knowledge by Merriam-Webster | www.merriam-webster.com
[23:34:09] <l554> ---- 1/2 (1.a.1) the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or association (1.a.2) acquaintance with or understanding of a science, art, or technique (1.b.1) the fact or condition of being aware of something (1.b.2) the range of one's information or understanding answered to the best of my knowledge
[23:34:19] <l554> ---- 2/2 (1.c) the circumstance or condition of apprehending truth or fact through reasoning : cognition (1.d) the fact or condition of having information or of being learned a person of unusual knowledge (2.a) the sum of what is known : the body of truth, information, and principles acquired by humankind (2.b) a branch of learning (archaic) (3) sexual intercourse (archaic) (4) cognizance (obsolete)
[23:34:41] <l554> I then said that I find the primary association of knowledge in this course with truthiness to be frustrating - because in English usage, knowledge is also associated with experience/association/awareness. So I am not convinced that truthiness is a hard requirement. See definition 1.b.2.
[23:34:59] <l554> E.g.: (A) For pre-socratic philosophers, what they knew about the sun was knowledge (yet incorrect). (B) For the driver in the countryside, what they knew about the barns (whether they were real or staged) was knowledge (yet partial). (C) For the human, what they know about God is knowledge (yet debatable). (D) For the Ferengi, what they know about the Romulans is knowledge (yet fictional).
[23:35:18] <l554> The responses I received so far to the above, more or less said that: narrow definitions are required in philosophy, and that false-knowledge is not knowledge but false belief.
[23:35:34] <l554> My problem with that is: philosophy then only addresses a narrow-range of use-cases. That philosophical arguments are correct only if you look at things in such-and-such a way. And that philosophy is only valid relative to those that create said rules.
