[00:00:38] <TomyWork> no
[00:00:59] <TomyWork> docker host?
[00:01:04] <TomyWork> docker container you mean?
[00:01:14] <Poster> not the container, the system running docker software and establishing the ipsec link
[00:01:21] <TomyWork> yes
[00:01:42] *** Joins: spare (~7r3eidahn@user/spareproject)
[00:02:46] <Poster> ok if that's not working there is a bigger problem, I am not very strong with ipsec to help troubleshooting but if the docker host isn't working on it's own, the container(s) don't have a working path to ride
[00:03:29] <TomyWork> like i said, the docker host has connectivity to targets on the other end of the ipsec link
[00:05:41] <Poster> I am just not sure what address would be used in terms of masquerading
[00:07:31] <TomyWork> i might have an indication as to where the issue lies
[00:07:55] <TomyWork> I told wireshark to filter for ARP instead of for the target host that I'm trying
[00:08:15] <TomyWork> it says "Who has 172.17.0.1? Tell 172.17.0.2"
[00:09:12] <Poster> that's all expected on your docker0 interface

[00:14:33] <TomyWork> I'm using strongswan, I'm pretty sure it already does something like this
[00:15:04] <TomyWork> otherwise i wouldnt be able to reach anything on the other side
[00:15:50] <Poster> you're trying to forward with the docker container, the docker host is input/output
[00:16:10] <Poster> plus the other side probably doesn't have a return route to the docker container, so some type of masquerade or SNAT is needed

[04:36:10] <kjetilho> not really.  it does make a text/plain part with "this is the body", but it doesn't have a content-disposition

[04:38:41] <kjetilho> it seems "wrong" to use mutt from cron :)
[04:38:50] <kjetilho> but that's not really rational
[04:39:18] <greycat> one of the mailx variants should also be viable
[04:39:35] <jdccdevel> kjetiho: If you're looking for something really specific formatting wise, it may be simpler to write a custom program in some scripting language to get exactly what you want.
[04:40:44] <jdccdevel> Emails sent from the command line tend to be pretty basic in my experience.
[04:41:20] <greycat> the result of my own battle against Debian's scriptable mail user agents is shown here:  https://wiki.debian.org/NewInStretch#Upgrade_issues

[04:42:01] <jelly> what is it you're missing in mutt cli
[04:42:09] <kjetilho> it set "Content-Type: text/csv; charset=iso-8859-1"
[04:42:41] <kjetilho> so the first part it guessed right from my filename, but why latin1?  I'm in a UTF-8 locale.
[04:43:17] <greycat> presumably because you didn't use any characters outside of Latin-1

[04:44:18] <kjetilho> yeah, actually it does convert UTF-8 to Latin1 correctly.
[04:44:20] <jelly> mutt tries reasonably hard to use more efficient charset for inline text parts, I did not know it would do that for attachments as well
[04:44:41] <kjetilho> but Thunderbird does not convert it back to UTF-8 when I save it :-p

[04:45:55] <kjetilho> yeah, but it is
[04:47:11] <jelly> kjetilho, see if setting send_charset to precisely "utf-8" works around that
[04:47:28] <jelly> on the mutt, sending end
[04:47:41] <kjetilho> I need a muttrc for that?

[14:09:16] <kjetilho> perhaps you want policy routing?
[14:09:24] <yogg> the "192.168.1.1" comes from keepalived and is the younger one

[14:12:05] <kjetilho> with policy routing you can choose a different route based on e.g., your local source port (for return traffic)

[15:07:46] <Walex2> kjetilho: my approach to "setting up HA" is to bind applications to /32 addresses on "dummy" interfaces, that is to give each host a node address as well as interface address. I think that binding applications to interface addresses is fundamentally fragile.
[15:09:12] <Walex2> in an ideal world applications would not even be bound to node /32 addresses, but to per-application /32 addresses, at least in some cases.

[16:06:27] <orl> I'm trying to debug a software (non-mixer) which crashed only when launched through a studio manager (Raysession), which uses python scripts to launch apps, and some audio standard called NSM to get things working together. I'd like to produce coredump of this app, but I don't find how to do it, as I cannot run the app outside the studio (or it won't crash). I've tried using ulimit -S -c unlimited, and then

[18:50:45] <incal> o/ I've heard that for gaming you want/need a 600~800W PSU <https://www.windowscentral.com/be-quiet-pure-power-11-fm-review> but how do I know how many W I need for my use? I think the most resource-intense I do would be compiling and watching multimedia on mpv. can you use powertop(1) for this or some other tool or can it not be measured at the software level? and if it can't, can you estimate it somehow? TIA
[18:51:53] <jelly> buy a $10 wattmeter and measure.
[18:51:59] <blacked> Haohmaru: ok come there some time :)
