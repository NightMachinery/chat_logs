[04:29:35] <ghostboarder> guys, can someone tell me what this block of text is trying to do? It appears to just be a list of commands or maybe something that is part of a conf? https://markuta.com/bitwarden-and-nginx-server-on-raspberry-pi/#first-time-start-up
[04:30:07] <ghostboarder> i am following that guide and am stuck at that point as the writer doesnt specific how to use those commands, and docker says the syntax is incorrect

[04:36:31] <rawtaz> ghostboarder: as you can presumable see it's a docker command that runs bitwardenrs/server:latest - isnt that fairly obvious?
[04:36:35] <rawtaz> it's one command, FWIW
[04:37:08] <ghostboarder> thats what i thought and tried, but the very first line of the command apparently has incorrect syntax to docker
[04:37:11] <rawtaz> if you have a "syntax incorrect" issue, then the obvious thing to do is to look at what the message is telling you. and if you need help, *obviously* you need to show the complete message ;)
[04:37:28] <rawtaz> does that make sense?
[04:37:38] <ghostboarder> lol, yes. pastebin?
[04:38:11] <rawtaz> yeah
[04:38:20] <ghostboarder> gotcha hang on
[04:38:52] <rawtaz> interesting, i wonder what the person thinks "hardening" means :D

[04:39:22] <ghostboarder> i wondered that as well
[04:39:52] <ghostboarder> anyway, command entered as one command, aaaaaaam i not supposed to be using the slashes? =)
[04:40:05] <rawtaz> correct
[04:40:29] <rawtaz> slashes at the end of lines denote that the line continues on the next line, but if you put it all on one line you shouldnt have the slashes there
[04:41:02] <ghostboarder> ok. some people code. not this guy. although it reeeeally looks like i should start to learn 
[04:41:08] <rawtaz> haa
[04:41:09] <rawtaz> haha*
[04:41:37] <rawtaz> this is actually more about using bash/linux/unix than it is about coding, it has nothing to do with the latter

[04:49:22] <ghostboarder> the guide was also about getting a cert and using nginx, but i havent got to that point yet, and it was written a year ago for bitwarden, not VAULTwarden as the creator calls it now. With mandatory HTTPS

[04:51:12] <rawtaz> then you can go on to make a nice docker-compose.yaml file which has this and a reverse proxy in it (you can use traefik or caddy or of course nginx - the latter might be easier since theres probably more examples with it out there)

[04:59:35] <ghostboarder> oh yeah, thats not an issue
[04:59:38] <rawtaz> no, youre wrong. it is not now vaulwarden, not at all

[05:00:09] <rawtaz> bitwarden still exists, it's the original. but someone wrote a "clone" of bitwarden in another programming language named Rust and called it bitwarden-rs, and THIS was later renamed to vaultwarden.
[05:00:15] <ghostboarder> i know its still bitwarden, but this implementation has now changed name
[05:00:23] <ghostboarder> yes, correct
[05:00:25] <BtbN> vaultwarden is a 3rd party tool

[05:03:55] <ghostboarder> i honestly dont know yet

[08:04:26] <larsks> rmaw: That line caues "nginx -s reload" to run every six hours while the container is running.
[08:05:33] <larsks> The body of the while loop is 'sleep 6h & wait $!', where $! is written $${!} because you need to escape $ in your docker-compose.
[08:06:46] <larsks> (sorry, that should say "the body of the while loop is 'sleep 7h & wait $!; nginx -s reload')

[09:45:34] <apple-corps> Hello, on a native linux system awhile back I tried to configure my docker to use a local address IP range so the docker interface would appear on my local network. Anyhow it didn't work. I see it setup with a local ip range. But it breaks the internet access on my laptop. Anyhow I've been removing the docker network interface for like 2 years
[09:45:34] <apple-corps> neglecting it. Does anyone rock a configuration like this and have it setup proper?

[19:03:22] <programmerq> vogelfrei there might be a full blown network monitoring solution that can do that. I worked at a company where there was a capability to log network connection attempts for auditing. It just used the ebpf functionality in the kernel instead of doing a full blown tcpdump. As far as restricting egress, just connect that container to a docker network that was created with 'docker network create

[19:13:40] <programmerq> You can use the open source sysdig project to see all events on a system. This will print every connection attempt on a host that originates from a container. It's a little noisy, so you might need to fiddle with the syntax a bit to narrow it down more: sudo sysdig -pc 'container.name!=host and evt.type=connect'

[19:52:22] <hackers> I'm having a network issue where I put a bunch of containers on the same network and they access each others by hostname, however one of these containers *requires* to be accessed by the right hostname (it's like a multi-site app where sites are identified by the hostname used to connect to it)

[20:31:33] <programmerq> lantech19446▸ the docker desktop stuff just simplifies getting linux containers to run on your mac or windows box. it has a gui, file sharing into a VM, port forwarding from your host to the VM that matches up with the docker port publishing, and has a ton more things that try to simplify running docker commands on a non-linux system. On a linux system, you can just install docker directly and
[20:31:35] <programmerq> you don't really need that extra VM layer.
