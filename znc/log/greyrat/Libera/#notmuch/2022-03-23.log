[15:48:18] <lelit> Hi! A couple of days ago a change in Emacs master renamed hl-line-overlay to hl-line--overlay, breaking notmuch-hl-line-mode
[15:49:32] <lelit> as a temporary workaround I redefined that form using the "private" name and it seems to work, but I cannot say whether that's appropriate...
[15:52:29] <drvink> a little strange that something previously public was made "private" like that and they didn't bother to defvaralias
[15:52:43] <drvink> you could just do that yourself though
[15:53:45] <drvink> maybe email the person that made the change and/or post to emacs-devel about it?
[15:55:02] <drvink> (i can't go find the commit at the moment to see what the context is)
[15:59:58] <lelit> right
[16:02:54] <lelit> see http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=0a094fb65ca1392231ef8176f89f936e39f3296e and
[16:04:34] <lelit> a few others after that, by dickmao and lars, in particular http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=3054e70d76f71876c58497db04f55d7f413663d9
[16:06:27] <drvink> ah.  well, from that latter commit, it looks like you're ok to use hl-line--overlay instead
[16:06:47] <drvink> though i agree it's strange that it's renamed that way if it's intended to be part of the public interface

[21:58:57] <atrus> Anybody come up with a way to paste copied images into a emacs-notmuch compose-mail buffer?
[22:00:15] <atrus> (my workaround right now is a script that looks at the mime type(s) of the content in the clipboard, dumps it into an appropriately-named file in /tmp, and replaces the clipboard with the filename, so I can attach that)
[22:00:34] <acdw> maybe try org-mime?
[22:01:08] <atrus> other than knowing that org-mode and mime-types are a thing, I don't have any context for what that means :)
[22:01:52] <acdw> https://github.com/org-mime/org-mime
[22:02:21] <acdw> also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aml36yZ-ANc
[22:07:51] <atrus> INTERESTING. thanks!
[22:10:13] <acdw> :)
[22:10:24] <acdw> i've not fully configured it but it seems promising
[22:28:29] <atrus> i've been hesitant about getting into org-mode further. from the outside it seems a little like a sub-cult within the emacs-cult, and i don't know how deep I want to go :p
[22:29:27] <atrus> it does remind me that maybe, just maybe, i want to use a non-emacs notmuch client, that's a little more consistent with the rest of my desktop apps.
[22:33:59] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@fixed-186-96-26-198.totalplay.net)
[22:38:04] <atrus> i'm not sure what the options are these days, if there even is a "normal gnome-ish email GUI client  that happens to use notmuch as a backend"
[22:39:41] <acdw> > it seems a little like a sub-cult within the emacs-cult
[22:39:42] <acdw> it is
[22:39:43] <atrus> (by gnome-ish, i guess i don't mean "needs to use gnome/gtk" but, looks and feels like any other app i use, with normal keybindings, normal-looking fonts/widgets, etc etc)
[22:39:55] <acdw> atrus: i tihnk there are , but i'm not sure
[22:41:30] <atrus> i've tried astroid from time to time, but it mostly seemed like "terminal-type behavior that happens to be rendered graphicall", ie, heavy custom-keyboard-user focus.
