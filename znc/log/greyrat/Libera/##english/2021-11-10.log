[00:55:05] <z_lehinsun> Hi! Can you explain what is the difference between "She could have won" and "She could won"?
[00:55:16] <braxas> The second sentence is wrong
[00:55:24] <z_lehinsun> oh sorry
[00:55:28] <z_lehinsun> "she could win"
[00:55:51] <braxas> hang on, let me find tense names
[00:58:22] <braxas> okay, I can't remember tense names. "She could have won" means that she cannot win anymore, but at some point in the past there was a possibility for her to still win, but at the time the sentence was written that possibility no longer exists. "She could win" means that there is still a possibility for her to win at the time the sentence was written.
[00:58:39] <braxas> not sure if that helps
[00:59:27] <darsie> braxas: It's about learning English.
[00:59:40] <braxas> darsie: nope
[01:00:01] <darsie> yes
[01:00:34] <braxas> if it is, your question is not well phrased
[01:00:56] <darsie> Ok, can the effect caused by ethanol ingestion by humans be described as high?
[01:02:49] <darsie> Who says I have to phrase it a specific way to learn English?
[01:02:50] <braxas> yes, I would not say this is common use of the adjective, but it is valid. From wiktionary: "high, adjective: (informal) Intoxicated; under the influence of a mood-altering drug, formerly usually alcohol, but now (from the mid-20th century) usually not alcohol but rather marijuana, cocaine, heroin, etc."
[01:03:11] <darsie> I can learn from side effects.
[01:03:28] <braxas> darsie: if you ask "Can you get high from ethanol?" this seems to me a question about basic physiology.
[01:03:50] <braxas> or no, it is a question of physiology
[01:03:54] <braxas> not just seems
[01:03:57] *** Joins: iroha (~iroha@user/iroha)
[01:05:50] <braxas> in most cases if you tell people someone is high, they will not likely thing you mean the same thing as drunk, high has very different connotations, but this does not mean high is the wrong word to use to describe someone intoxicated by alcohol 
[01:06:32] <braxas> but it does mean if you want to communicate with less ambiguity that someone is intoxicated by alcohol that there are better word choices than high

[02:04:34] <blkshp> Cause the second sentence is 2 sentences.
[02:05:22] <blkshp> The first quote is correct. The second is not what you mean it to be.

[23:19:20] <ukleinek> I wonder about the sentence: "There is a lot of violent crime in the city center." Can I also write " ... crimes ... "?
[23:19:43] *** Joins: AsenMx (~AsenMx@user/asenmx)
[23:20:27] <twb> What's the earliest attestation of "bumblelord" ?
[23:20:48] <twb> ukleinek: yes, you can, but I think it sounds better uncountable
[23:21:12] <twb> "There ARE a lot of violent crimeS in the city centre."
[23:22:41] <ukleinek> twb: I found many references in the net where "a lot of [word in plural]" is still considered a singular construct.
[23:23:38] <twb> "a lot of dog" is wrong; "a lot of water" is OK, because "water" is uncountable.
[23:23:47] <twb> Your original example, "crime", can be countable OR uncountable
[23:24:08] <twb> 'a dog', 'a crime', 'some water', 'some crime'
[23:24:44] <ukleinek> yeah, that I found, too. uncountable words are used in singular, countable words in plural
[23:24:53] <ukleinek> and that crime is both, countable and uncountable
[23:26:12] <pussipupu> “a lot of dog” is fine if you mean dog meat, or if you're complimenting a dog on its size to be fair
[23:26:20] <twb> fair
[23:26:55] <pussipupu> In general nouns and similar creatures can be used countably and uncountably, but they tend to have defaults
[23:27:07] <ukleinek> by the way: The background of the question is that my daughter's English teacher deducted a point for "There is a lot of violent crimes in the city center." because of the plural 's'.
[23:27:43] <pussipupu> It's because “is” doesn't agree with “crimes”
[23:27:57] <pussipupu> Singular verb, plural argumet
[23:27:57] <pussipupu> *argument
[23:31:04] * LuisP18 just finds it ok
[23:31:25] *** Joins: romare (~st.pauli@user/romare)
[23:34:02] * LuisP18 presents them with a full lot of dogs
[23:34:23] <ukleinek> From a logical point of view it's "a lot" and so it's singular?!
[23:36:08] <pussipupu> no, "a lot" doesn't work like that
[23:36:41] <twb> 'a lot of' is a quantifier, like 'some' or 'five litres of'
[23:37:12] <mdogg> ukleinek－ I wolud write "There is a lot of violent crime in the city center."  rather than, "There are lots of violent crimes in the city center."
[23:37:29] <pussipupu> But it's neither plural nor singular in itself
[23:39:38] <LuisP18> that's pretty much the view everybody gives this [article+noun+preposition] of a phrase
[23:39:59] <ukleinek> pussipupu, twb, LuisP18: Thanks for your thoughts
[23:41:58] <ukleinek> twb: so 'a lot of' is different to 'a group of', right? Like: "A group of students takes a train to London."
[23:42:08] <twb> yes
[23:42:21] <twb> there the noun is "group"
[23:42:30] <twb> And "of students" is qualifying what kind of group it is
[23:42:52] <twb> Like if you had "I have two sausages [made of cow]"

[23:43:58] <varde> Is the pronoun it associated with this and that nouns?
[23:44:04] <ukleinek> ah yes, oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com agrees, "lot" is a determiner, and "group" is a noun.
[23:44:33] <twb> varde: can you use 'quote marks' ?  It's hard to understand you
[23:44:42] <twb> varde: at least, *I* have trouble understanding
[23:44:52] <ukleinek> +1
[23:45:02] <varde> Is the pronoun 'it' associated with 'this' and 'that'
[23:45:07] <gajus> 'No logs found matching the current filter.'
[23:45:12] <gajus> is the needed here?
[23:45:22] <varde> It was Sunday
[23:45:33] <twb> varde: I don't *think* so.  this/that are locative.  They tell you where something is in relation to speaker/listener
[23:45:57] <twb> varde: "this brick", "this wife", "this man"
[23:46:22] <twb> gajus: if you omit it, you will be understood, but you will sound a bit stilted and computer-y
[23:47:46] <gajus> gotcha. thank you
[23:48:08] <gajus> I was only wondering b/c ton of official error messages are not adding 'the'
[23:48:55] <LuisP18> pretty much what they're going for
[23:49:13] <twb> "Dog not found" versus "Sorry, I could not find the dog you asked me to eat."
[23:49:48] <twb> I guess the Laconic human version would be "what dog?" or just "dog?"
[23:50:16] <varde> Sounds like it's missing a 'that' but contains a 'this'. Such as 'it was Sunday', when? 'it was Sunday' 'that' was in the morning, otherwise it is unfinished.
[23:51:07] <varde> It was Sunday = a shorthand expression, and not proper
