[01:24:41] <recursiveNode> gravypod I thought of *automatically* deploying consumergroups. Each consumergroup represents a different user-defined pattern. Each consumergroup needs to autoscale automatically without the user tweaking the autoscaler, if possible.
[01:25:12] <gravypod> Yea, you only need to run the numbers once
[01:25:47] <recursiveNode> gravypod yes, I spam data into a partitioned kafka topic with 10 partitions, and then use an autoscaled consumergroup to eat data using 1 consumer at first, autoscaled up to 10 consumers 
[01:25:52] <gravypod> Your kafka server will have a max throughput. Once you have scaling settings that work from 1 message/second to $MAX/second you don't really need to worry much

[01:29:13] <gravypod> No, in that case (since you're scaling effectively different services) you'd need to figure out that metric for each service
[01:29:42] <gravypod> But, if you're doing that you could try starting out with something like scaling by CPU usage of the different jobs

[01:30:46] <gravypod> That's probably not what you want to do. I'm assuming this is the queue delay for kafka?
[01:30:47] <recursiveNode> it currently scales based on the kafka topic lag (the sum of all lags from all shards of the topic)
[01:31:03] <gravypod> Interesting
[01:31:07] <recursiveNode> gravypod it's the producer offset - consumer offset
[01:32:02] <gravypod> It looks like `kafka_consumergroup_group_lag_seconds` is exposed

[02:42:40] <b0nn> owner of the mutable resources is the only one allowed to make changes 3) Functional programming - where only copies are passed around, thus changes can only be made by one process; 4) Anything goes

[03:56:29] <Kamui> any good articles explaining this?
[03:56:37] <W> Kamui, e.g. test driven development generally involves writing unit tests for all code, because you don't write implementation code without a test already done for it
[03:57:04] <pulse> Kamui, you write a test for each "unit" - what a unit is is arbitrarily defined. it could be a function, an interface, an API, a class, any type of abstraction etc.

[03:57:39] <W> most people generally test very ad hoc; no coverage standard, and not even any specific standard that tests should be unit tests or integration tests or anything like that, just testing what you feel uncertain of, or feel you need some extra confidence in being correct
[03:57:48] <pulse> unit testing doesn't necessarily have anything to do with TDD
[03:57:53] <Kamui> how do I know what exactly to test
[03:58:08] <jeaye> By understanding what you're writing and how it could break.
[03:58:12] <Kamui> wouldn't testing every bit of code be a little excessive?
[03:58:16] <pulse> Kamui, you don't, and you also can't ever be sure that your tests are valid
[03:58:27] <pulse> you would need an endlessly recursive chain of tests that test tests that test tests etc.
[03:58:34] <W> Kamui, a matter of subjective opinion, obviously
[03:59:12] <W> Kamui, personally, having worked doing test driven development with every piece of code tested, I don't find it particularly costly in any way once you're used to it

[03:59:27] <Kamui> I see
[03:59:41] <pulse> it gets costly if your program depends on something external

[04:00:36] <pulse> Kamui, yes
[04:00:45] <W> TDD specifically flips the typical incentive for testing on its head, so writing the test is part of the design of classes and so on, where most of the interesting work happens, and so implementations is the less interesting part - but also more automatic, easier, with a clear goal once you start

[04:01:42] <ornxka> does anyone know of a wordlist which contains grammatical information along with the words themselves
[04:01:44] <pulse> integration testing is basically system testing
[04:01:57] <pulse> if unit testing is individual then integration is holistic
[04:02:22] <W> Kamui, it depends on what you want. You can't just ask what you should do, do what youw ant
[04:02:23] <pulse> nothing like a user to show you just how inefficient all those testing methodologies really are, though
[04:02:48] <W> there's no one answer for any of this
[04:03:03] <ornxka> like, noun, verb, adjective, etc, and ideally with some kind of linking to other words (eg lightly = light + -ly suffix)
[04:03:05] <Kamui> well I want to follow the best practices, or industry standards for testing
[04:03:11] <W> Kamui, there are no such
[04:04:18] <pulse> Kamui, if the industry had such a thing as "best practices" then software wouldn't be riddled with bugs
[04:04:20] <W> I am pretty selective in where I work, and I would say less than half of my employers have had even an agreement amongst multiple developers on what "should" be done
[04:04:57] <pulse> all these design and testing methodologies are nothing more than a feeble attempt at making sense of the chaos that is programming
[04:05:02] <pulse> and it's not very efficient
[04:05:16] <pulse> in fact it can easily be misused and be the exact opposite of useful
[04:05:20] <W> no, many methodologies are very useful and effective
[04:05:45] <W> but the specific depends on language, codebase, the feelings and buy-in of the team, quality of management, etc etc
[04:05:50] <W> *the specifics

[04:13:46] <vdamewood> PowerShell doesn't modify $ENV:PWD when you change directory, so if you invoke it from another shell, the value in the other shell will persist to whatever PowerShell invokes, even if you change location.

[04:19:23] <vdamewood> My powershell script fails because when I try to download to "foo/file.jpg", it instead tries to download to "/some/other/path/foo/filejpg" because I switched locations before running my download script.
[04:19:57] <vdamewood> It it doesn't download to ./foo/jpg because $ENV:PWD is set to /some/other/path because that's where I was when I started powershell.
[04:20:26] <vdamewood> And, for some reason, the .NET function I'm invoking to download uses $ENV:PWD to resolve relative paths.

[07:20:46] <InPhase> Izem: People who have highly desired skill levels commonly apply to one or a few jobs, get them, and then start the new position.  Then there are people who apply to hundreds through thousands of jobs because they are not getting the jobs they are applying for.  When you are trying to hire, you get far more of the second group, but the people you most want to hire look more like the first group.  
[07:20:52] <InPhase> Even though good candidates make up a pretty decent fraction of the workforce, they do not make up such a good fraction of the applicant pool.  It takes a lot of work to extract them.
[07:21:57] <Izem> interesting
[07:22:13] <InPhase> I would never penalize someone for having applied to a bunch of jobs (nor would I commonly know for any individual).  But that's just to give a sense for why the applicant pool statistics might be surprisingly mismatched from the expectations.
[07:22:28] <Izem> yeah that makes sense
[07:22:42] <Izem> I was previously shotgunning it myself (sorta)
[07:23:13] <Izem> do you put information out for candidates that do research? might make it easier
[07:23:21] <InPhase> Yes.
[07:23:26] <InPhase> And it does.
[07:23:38] <Izem> nice
[07:24:11] <InPhase> One of the most effective first pass filters is looking for the candidates who were specifically interested in that job over "a" job.

[13:32:00] <DnzAtWrk> more like buggy and unreliable
[13:32:06] <tenochtitlan> whatsupboy: Which framework should I learn?
[13:32:09] <DnzAtWrk> it puts the onus on the dev to keep track of all the types
[13:32:16] <DnzAtWrk> with very little benefit
[13:32:32] <tenochtitlan> DnzAtWrk: It's good for prototyping from what I hear.
[13:32:34] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: Lets have an example that applies to a tiny side project I've just done now.  I wrote a tiny little server that provides a list of all the people, in json; and I wrote this in Haskell.
[13:32:55] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: I am also writing a tiny SwiftUI app in well, Swift (duh!), that consumes this json.
[13:32:55] <DnzAtWrk> is there a pro which isn't just "it's faster"?
[13:33:05] <whatsupboy> tenochtitlan:  what ever you like, kotlin is good language as I hear

[13:33:26] <tenochtitlan> whatsupboy: Have you used Kotlin?
[13:33:43] <whatsupboy> tenochtitlan:  No
[13:33:44] <DnzAtWrk> json? If you want it as an object, using serialization
[13:33:49] <DnzAtWrk> or a hashmap
[13:33:52] <DnzAtWrk> of some type
[13:33:55] <tenochtitlan> whatsupboy: What do you use?
[13:34:24] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: So, dynamically? Instead of defining a json schema, making the server validate against it,  and code-generating the parser from it for the client?
[13:34:40] <DnzAtWrk> user data is user data
[13:34:50] <tenochtitlan> DnzAtWrk: If I some point of time in the future you decide to restructure, it's easier with dynamic typing.
[13:34:59] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: The /shape/ of that user data is the issue, though.
[13:35:04] <DnzAtWrk> Completely disagree
[13:35:10] <DnzAtWrk> restructure is way easier WHEN YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS
[13:35:15] <DnzAtWrk> which dynamic typing makes harder
[13:35:17] <whatsupboy> tenochtitlan: kotlin is interoperatable with java and android offically consider kotlin as their primary language so it may stay relevant in the future 
[13:35:35] <tenochtitlan> whatsupboy: How is Flutter?
[13:35:54] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: Dynamic typing makes you store the types in your head, that's pretty much the only difference.  The implication is, however, is that your tools stop being able to tell you where the mismatches are.
[13:36:00] <DnzAtWrk> Exactly
[13:36:08] <DnzAtWrk> instead of actually write out the types directly in the code
[13:36:12] <DnzAtWrk> you put it in transient storage
[13:36:18] <DnzAtWrk> which will last as long as the dev is working the project
[13:36:22] <DnzAtWrk> terrible idea imo
[13:36:26] <arahael> Right.  With static typing, you have to define everything up-front.
[13:36:32] *** Quits: justBull (~justache@user/justache) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:36:38] <DnzAtWrk> That's the good thing about static typing

[13:37:11] <DnzAtWrk> it's about returning to old code

[13:37:30] <DnzAtWrk> instead of just looking at the function in isolation
[13:37:39] <whatsupboy> tenochtitlan: I am not sure
[13:38:01] <mrig> DnzAtWrk: from what I have gathered whilst speaking with a programmer who uses these dynamic languages, the project maintenance and consequent dependence of the client upon the manufacturer, makes for a good business model.
[13:38:17] <mrig> lots of mokney business.
[13:38:29] <DnzAtWrk> That is the old adage of "making it shitty on purpose so the client has to rely on me"
[13:38:38] <DnzAtWrk> That's just an argument to make bad code for job security
[13:38:39] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: If the "dynamic" surface is small, it's really not bad at all.  But it doesn't scale well unless you set up a lot more infrastructure, and once you have that infrastructure, having static typing ends up supporting it really well. It's generally a win-win scenario to use static typing as your project scales up.

[13:39:35] <DnzAtWrk> simple programs are easier to understand, ESPECIALLY with dynamic typing
[13:39:36] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: So it's really quite a nunanced topic.
[13:39:46] <DnzAtWrk> but as complexity grows, static typing will save you more and more effort
[13:39:58] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: Right - dynamic scales down really well. static scales up really well.
[13:40:05] <DnzAtWrk> But I argue that static typing by default would be worth the little extra effort
[13:40:26] <mrig> arahael: yes the shell is a wonderful example, these are what dynamic language really are it would seem.

[14:14:27] <CalimeroTeknik> the concept of a port applies to both, in that it is the address of the communication channel to some part of a system
[14:14:43] <CalimeroTeknik> (abstractly speaking there is that in common)
[14:15:04] <immibis> a port is like "a number that identifies a thing where you can send stuff"
[14:15:11] <immibis> which is really vague
[14:15:28] <immibis> or even just "a place you can send stuff"
[14:15:34] <CalimeroTeknik> hey, I said the same with intellectual-looking words, which makes it not "vague" but "abstract" :p
[14:15:54] <vdamewood> pyzozord: When you say network ports, you mean like how http is on port 80?
[14:15:57] <CalimeroTeknik> btw - abstraction is extremely precise
[14:16:24] <pyzozord> vdamewood: yeah, I'm not aware of any other network ports tbh
[14:16:37] <GeDaMo> The physical connector on the computer can also be called a port
[14:16:39] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Those ports are on layer 4.
[14:16:43] <CalimeroTeknik> that's specifically an IP port, pyzozord; there are others
[14:16:53] <vdamewood> ^ And I was going to mention those. Those ports are layer 1.

[14:18:13] <pyzozord> ah I see, ok so IP ports are from IP (that makes sense, duh me). But now I'm curious do layer 1 network ports are the same as x86 io ports or are those also different ports?

[17:02:23] <pulse> typically you prefer composition over inheritance yes
[17:02:42] <W> OOP is many things to may people. In modern OOP, composition is generally favoured over implementation inheritance, though inheritance still remains in types
[17:02:53] <mrig> typically you think about what you are doing, see the bigger picture and use whichever is best suited.
[17:03:02] <W> okay, "modern" is perhaps a bit too biased; but I don't know of a name of this line of thinking.
[17:03:15] <mrig> if you cant see the bigger picture, probably best to stick to frameworks.
[17:03:27] <pulse> it's easier to reason about composition, but inheritance is far more powerful
[17:03:38] <pulse> you can do inheritance chains
[17:03:38] <W> basically, there are many schools of thought, and none have any special claim to "the" OOP

[17:20:14] <mrig> ECS is still OOP \o/
[17:20:17] <arahael> If you do a rewrite, imho, the rewrite should be pretty much the same as the old system in terms of the user experience.
[17:20:34] <W> gamedev have actual legitimate reasons for doing this, or at least had until lately, namely that hardware itself changes fast, and the interface you use in your engine and tie closely to for optimal performance, will be different 5 years later
[17:20:36] <arahael> If you want to radically change the user experience, focus on that _instead_ of the rewrite, or perhaps _after_ the rewrite.
[17:20:53] <pulse> mrig, no, it's not
[17:20:54] <arahael> W: Ah, you meant hardware platform, my mistake.

[17:21:26] <mrig> pulse: as I previously mentioned this is well explained in the design patterns book.
[17:21:33] <pulse> mrig, pure ECS is definitely not OOP
[17:21:34] <arahael> W: Hardware's a good reason to rewrite.  The old hardware is not going to keep getting maintained and leapfrog your new approach.
[17:21:37] <W> but engines generally cannot so easily ignore the low level realities (or at least game developers are unwilling to)
[17:21:46] <mrig> seems that people started chanting "gang of four" but none read the work.

[17:39:01] <W> I don't know anything about go besides that there is or has been debate about generics in it, but I think I'm not out of line to suggest that go has *some kind of* OOP at least. Like I repeatedly say, OOP is many things.
[17:39:53] <vdamewood> W: What would you consider OOP then?
[17:40:11] <mrig> I am fine with it once you start coding it in the terminal, but the start up time of the engine is atrocious; And most people try to dissuade you from using it in anything but a fully fledged IDE.
[17:40:13] <vdamewood> I mean, When they made Go, they tried very hard to make it NOT OOP.
[17:40:24] <mrig> go is OOP.
[17:40:30] <W> vdamewood, it might be simply that I am very mistaken
[17:40:39] <mrig> anyone who thinks otherwise has sort of missed the point.
[17:40:47] <W> like I said, don't know anything about go. I did look at it once, but cannot recall a single thing from when I did
[17:41:32] <mrig> C was coded OOP, as a way to get around silly compile patterns and dependencies.
[17:41:37] <W> mrig, Java startup has been blazing fast for the last 7 versions or so
[17:42:01] <mrig> W it could be that this is an old version, but then I am also used to go's instant activity.

[17:43:01] <W> when I used to do GPGPU in Java, and tried to get some sense of the performance, it took ~300ms to get the benchmark up to speed, and most of that was in the GPU interfacing, so the JVM itself is fast
[17:43:54] <mrig> vdamewood: where are the messages between objects in either C++ or Java?
[17:44:07] <mrig> seems that this is fundamental to OOP.
[17:44:17] <mrig> as originally conceived.
[17:44:31] <W> of course, Java /software/ isn't necessarily going to be fast just because the JVM gets up and running fast :) I am quite familiar with Java GUI software that takes many seconds on a splash screen before it displays anything usable
[17:45:30] <mrig> W: I'm thinking of application being a part of a UNIXesque pipeline, where the start up is really noticeable. Perhaps there is a way to leave it running for this kind of use?
[17:45:39] <gtlsgamr> W: I hate java GUI software with a passion
[17:45:43] <W> mrig, way I see it, method calls are messages. This might miss something from smalltalk, but it is still pragmatic and works if it does

[17:56:46] <mrig> arahael: sure no, you have to do that in a C like way.

[17:57:05] <arahael> mrig: Yeah, indeed, and like C, Go is simply not an OOP language. :)
[17:57:13] <arahael> But again, yes, you can do OOP in Go.
[17:57:19] <mrig> thinking about it like this really helps to structure go code.
[17:57:19] <W> arahael, indeed it does not, but like that link pyzozord shared earlier notes, inheritance is mostly moot in terms of OOP these days, and even things no one would argue is not OOP tend to avoid it
[17:57:58] <arahael> W: In that case, you can do all this directly in Haskell, too.
[17:58:05] * W nods
[17:58:06] <vdamewood> mrig: I didn't say anything about Java or C++, nor did I specify which definition of OOP I was referring to. So, it's pretty unfair to expect me defend any position involving them, or a particular definition of OOP.
[17:58:14] <mrig> arahael: I never was a big fan of acronyms :D

[18:00:44] <pyzozord> I heard something recently that the only way for actually communicating is accepting the fact that language is imprecise and has ambiguities and embracing the laborus work of repeated conversations/discussions over and over again because each time it helps just a bit to understand a bit better what the other person has in mind
[18:01:00] <W> message passing, too, seems to mean mostly anything these days, and going by the Wikipedia usage of the term, both C++ and Java has message passing.

[18:55:48] <pyzozord> tbh I don't think there is such a thing as "pure" language, it can facilitate some things or disencourage others, but if a stubborn programmer wants to develop in a OO way in a pure FP language, they can
[18:56:11] <hexology> xeno: what's a "pure" OO language in the first place? smalltalk?
[18:56:13] <pyzozord> life finds a way
[18:56:21] <W> xeno, I don't see how you can make that distinction. I'd say both Java and Javascript are "pure" OO languages
[18:56:51] <W> objects are fundamental to the working of the languages and you cannot avoid using that part if you want anything done sensibly
[18:57:02] <hexology> python is quite deeply object-oriented too. ruby even moreso.

[18:58:13] <pyzozord> s/a program/a programming language/
[18:59:59] <W> pyzozord, but most programming languages are not aiming for expressive power in this sense. In Java, you cannot write fully functional code, simply because your entry point must be reachable through a class. And even if you ignore that and just keep using functional features inside your main method and/or the class it resides in treating that aspect as an artifact: all the functional features are _on top of_ objects, and no abstraction is fully without leaks
[19:01:52] <pyzozord> W: yeah that's a good point. I think the last thing you said "no abstraction is fully without leaks" is very profound
[19:01:56] <W> sure you can write Stream.of({a,b,c}).filter(...).map(...).collect(grouping(...)) and so on, and it looks mostly functional. But then you want your own collector, and you realize, this means writing a class, because Collector isn't a functional interface
[19:02:21] <pyzozord> like the same way as there are gaps or paradoxes even in mathematical systems

[19:55:57] <Quietwalker> If this is a systemic issue, the percents for all bins will be about the same
[19:56:20] <Quietwalker> if it's bin-related, there will be peaks and our target will be the high outliers.
[19:56:40] <Quietwalker> and if it's completely random, overlaying multiple days of data should show us there is no coherent trend.
[19:56:48] <Quietwalker> I think that will work

[19:57:00] <Quietwalker> yep

[22:20:34] <InPhase> mrig: Right.  It is almost mandatory to change languages to exploit the greater computational power available to the compiler.  Because even if we want to still compile down to tight efficient code, we can do that much better now by using a fancy machine to compile stuff.

[22:33:55] <pyzozord> this should be super simple right?
