[03:53:01] <MacGyver> Snyp: dmenu itself isn't an executable launcher. It's just a dynamic menu.
[03:53:14] <MacGyver> Snyp: dmenu_run is a script with the single line: `dmenu_path | dmenu "$@" | ${SHELL:-"/bin/sh"} &`
[03:53:46] <MacGyver> Snyp: And dmenu_path is another simple script that just takes all the executables from $PATH and outputs them on stdout.
[03:54:10] <MacGyver> Snyp: So as you can see, all that `dmenu` does there is allow you to select an entry from a list of input strings.
[03:54:49] <MacGyver> Snyp: I just suggested dmenu because it's the most straightforward option if you don't mind typing.

[10:21:21] <thursdaylark> that was just me testing the factoid
[10:21:32] <MathEros> ok
[10:22:38] <thursdaylark> Yeah, it's complaining about unsupported configuration, which I believe means that the codec isn't supported
[10:23:05] <thursdaylark> ugh FUCK proprietary codecs!
[10:23:26] <thursdaylark> this is the problem with apple going off and doing their own thing without sharing

[10:23:47] <Repentinus> I would try pipewire based on <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth_headset#Headset_via_Pipewire>.
[10:23:48] <phrik> Title: Bluetooth headset - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[10:23:54] <Repentinus> PipeWire acts as a drop-in replacement for PulseAudio and offers an easy way to set up Bluetooth headsets. It includes out-of-the-box support for A2DP sink profiles using SBC/SBC-XQ, AptX, LDAC or AAC codecs, and HFP/HSP. 
[10:24:37] <thursdaylark> out of my depth, but yeah, that's probably the path I'd take
[10:24:42] <MathEros> ugh got to do an update
[10:24:49] * thursdaylark should really play with pipewire sometime...
[10:25:01] <MathEros> got 404 error trying to download that
[10:25:23] <Repentinus> The package is pipewire-pulse.
[10:25:26] <thursdaylark> yup. tiem for updates :P
[10:25:34] <MathEros> yeah, only ~300mb update
[10:25:36] <Repentinus> Yeah, I also have no experience with pipewire, but seems easier than convincing pulseaudio to start understanding a codec it does not know about.
[10:25:39] <MathEros> I guess I can do that with my phone

[21:54:03] <beardedchimp> Hello, I'm trying to use a go/baduk/weqi client called katrain (its in the aur under that name). When I run it I have a very broken ui, I've spoken to the dev and they have no idea, I was wondering if anyone else in here would mind installing it and seeing if it works on other arch installs or if my setup is to blame
[21:54:22] <beardedchimp> This is how it looks on my machine https://i.imgur.com/1i7itll.png
