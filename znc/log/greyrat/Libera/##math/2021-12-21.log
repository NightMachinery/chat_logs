[00:01:13] <mycroftiv> yeah the transition from pure logic and boolean algebra to 'real mathematics' is pretty steep in terms of computer friendliness
[00:01:36] <mycroftiv> although some things like vectors and matrixes are very direct and natural in computers also
[00:02:40] <isekaijin> Only when you are working with explicit coordinates. The abstract coordinate-free stuff is still pretty annoying.
[00:03:14] <isekaijin> My general feel is that computers “like” mathematical objects defined by “presentations”.
[00:04:34] <isekaijin> Whereas human pure mathematicians prefer to work with objects defined by axioms.

[00:05:50] <mycroftiv> this is why the abstraction power of dependent types in agda or similar systems is really so astonishing, because it provides explicit computation that maps very easily to our basic fully generalized higher order logical abstractions
[00:07:43] <mycroftiv> i never thought computers could understand any of the abstract mathematics they do in proof assistants when i was growing up learning code in 80s, it was all just binary turing machine operations which could only really do arithmetic
[00:08:04] <mycroftiv> so writing computer code where i can make categories and quantify over 'all functions from the naturals to such and such' is just crazy to me

[00:09:26] <isekaijin> Not so sure about that. Basic mathematical objects have to be redefined very heavily to be more computer-friendly. For example, locales seem easier to formalize than topological spaces, and in principle, we could build our geometric spaces on top of locales rather than topological spaces. But nobody does this in pure math, because topological spaces provide something that is very convenient for
[00:09:27] <isekaijin> humans: actual points.
[00:10:24] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: actually people do exactly what you said they didnt although its not super mainstream, pointless topology is totally a thing the constructive mathematicians do with stuff like partial combinatory algebras
[00:10:37] <joel135> Cubical type theory provides a language of points without assuming that everything is built from points.
[00:10:52] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Yeah, that's fine, but where do you find geometers or other *users* of topological spaces using locales?

[00:11:32] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: i dunno, ive looked at some of the material and its so formal and technical ive just scanned it and never thought it was my priority to learn unless i had to
[00:12:10] <mycroftiv> people in computer science get pretty into the whole Scott DCPOs stuff which is related too
[00:12:24] <isekaijin> Any textbook on differential geometry will tell you that “a differentiable manifold is a *Hausdorff, second-countable topological space*, together with a system of charts such that...”.
[00:12:42] <joel135> Appeals to orthodoxy
[00:13:01] <mycroftiv> yea Maclane and Moerdijk sheaves book has a very nice section translating between sheaves and manifolds
[00:13:55] <mycroftiv> since you can express the charts of the atlas fitting together sheaf-style
[00:14:36] <isekaijin> Don't get me wrong, I actually feel that locales would probably be superior to topological spaces, because sheaves on locales behave better than sheaves on topological spaces in almost every way other than “we can recover the isomorphism type of a sheaf from its stalks”.
[00:14:55] <mycroftiv> Grothendieck wanted a 'tame topology'
[00:15:12] <isekaijin> But you need to convince all mathematicians, not just one silly grad student.

[00:18:00] <isekaijin> In order to get everyone to switch from topological spaces to locales as the basic building block on top of which geometric structures are defined.
[00:18:55] <mycroftiv> speaking for myself, my needs are just to understand how ultrafilters and sheaves fit together, and hopefully teach a computer to understand it also. https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/preprints/udn.pdf is a roadmap to about how it should work
[00:18:57] <isekaijin> In turn, the motivation for this was that “locales are easier to formalize than topological spaces”.

[00:20:16] <mycroftiv> yes, topological spaces via point-set topology are, as Grothendieck felt, kind of a painful way to get started
[00:20:38] <isekaijin> You would have to convince differential geometers about that.
[00:20:38] <joel135> Then it's just a tautology. You need to convince people in order to get them convinced.
[00:20:55] <isekaijin> No, it's not a tautology.
[00:20:59] <mycroftiv> as a set theory lover, i precisely understand why all the 'logical pathology' that building infinite point sets gets you into makes spatial reasoning sensibly very hard
[00:21:37] <joel135> mycroftiv: do you want to convince people to use locales? isekaijin: do you? i don't.
[00:21:40] <mycroftiv> Grothendieck categorical/topos ideas are intended to solve this and its convinced a lot of people in various ways
[00:21:51] <mycroftiv> joel135: i dont personally, i dont understand them much
[00:22:07] <isekaijin> joel135: I don't particularly have feelings either way. Topological spaces are good enough for my uses.
[00:22:34] <mycroftiv> I find the classical topological definitions easier to understand than Grothendieck sites and the categorical arrows going every which way personally :
[00:22:36] <isekaijin> joel135: But it's easy to see that sheaves on arbitrary topological spaces are not always well behaved.
[00:22:41] <joel135> then none of us is looking to convince all mathematicians
[00:22:50] <mycroftiv> even though category theory is friendlier and more established in my agda formalization domain
[00:23:49] <mycroftiv> sheaves are actually this crazy unification point between geometry topology point-sets categories and types

[00:24:50] <mycroftiv> since you can translate back and forth between the Grothendieck topological concepts in categories and the point-set classical concepts in most specific examples
[00:25:39] <isekaijin> joel135: Formalizing sheaves on topological spaces is annoying, because it is hard to even define a user-friendly type inhabited by the open subsets of a space.
[00:25:46] <mycroftiv> yes
[00:25:52] <isekaijin> And this is because your space is first and foremost a bag of points.
[00:26:28] <isekaijin> So if you care about formalization, then you should care about replacing topological spaces with something that is not total PITA to formalize.
[00:27:10] <isekaijin> Personally, I don't care about formalization *enough* to make it my life goal to solve this particular problem, though.

[00:28:22] <isekaijin> The nice thing about sites is that they axiomatize open covers directly. And when you look at how manifolds/varieties are defined using atlases, you notice that, curiously enough, the charts are also defined on the opens, not on the points.

[00:33:04] <isekaijin> Part of the problem here is that there's understanding and there's “understanding”. You can get the “intuitive basic idea” behind a definition, but ultimately the goal is to prove theorems, preferably *interesting* ones, so one has to do a lot more than “get the gist of...”.
[00:33:18] <mycroftiv> this is why i do agda formalization

[08:56:03] <grondilu> `Dt[f] /. Dt[x_] :> x` returns `Dt[f]` when I was expecting `f`.  What am I missing?
[08:57:03] <grondilu> it seems to work with any other function than Dt.
[09:03:18] <grondilu> ridiculously enough, I can make it work if I replace Dt first by a dummy function : `Dt[f] //. {Dt -> foo, foo[x_] :> x}`

[13:00:02] <PlanckWalk> But for my example the CR equations aren't satisfied at other points nearby
[13:01:54] <PlanckWalk> I'm having more trouble finding a function that satisfies CR in an open set but isn't real differentiable.
[13:02:58] <tmyklebu> PlanckWalk: what does "satisfies CR" mean for a function that isn't real-differentable?
[13:03:11] <PlanckWalk> CR is a condition on *partial* derivatives
[13:03:33] <PlanckWalk> Not all functions that have partial deerivatives are differentiable
[13:04:19] <PlanckWalk> I shoudl say R^2-differentiable rather than real-differentiable
[13:04:26] <PlanckWalk> But meh

I guess you could say the function's real and imaginary parts also have to have both partials existing throughout the domain, but "satisfying Cauchy-Riemann" makes that implicit.

[20:16:03] <isekaijin> riv: Notice that the determinant of an R-linear map V -> V can be defined intrinsically. It does not depend on the coordinates of R^n.
[20:16:20] <isekaijin> So this notion of orientation also works for tangent spaces of abstract manifolds.
[20:17:35] <isekaijin> So a local orientation is a smooth choice of bases of T^n, modulo change of basis with positive determinant. And a global orientation is obtained by gluing local orientations.

[21:39:20] <isekaijin> But this might fail when G is connected but not simply connected. I'm interested in classifying the different ways in which this might fail.
[21:40:06] <isekaijin> For example, when G is the torus R^2 / Z^2, then every line on g = R^2 is a Lie subalgebra of g.
[21:41:10] <isekaijin> But lines with rational slopes correspond to circles R/Z, whereas lines with irrational slopes correspond to densely immersed images of R in G.

[21:57:24] <Simplar> 6 teams participate in a quiz. All teams are of different ranks, and each round is won by a team with a higher rank. A winner will play with the randomly chosen opponent from the remaining teams. Those who lost a round are out of the game. Team [A] won their first three rounds. What's the probability for this team to win the fourth round as well?
