[00:02:16] <lz_> so I googled it and apparently the hospitalization rate for omicron is half the previous varient. It also mostly stays out of the lungs, so I'm not sure how people are dying (but people are still dying)

[00:10:19] <Nasp> nobody seem to care anymore
[00:13:18] <GetShwifty> lol counter<5 IS better lmao
[00:13:52] <knmae> The specs is not unambiguous
[00:14:10] <GetShwifty> specis a great place for discounts on alcohol here
[00:14:17] <GetShwifty> *specs is
[00:14:23] <jonp> GetShwifty: `counter<5` is significantly safer
[00:14:39] <GetShwifty> coming home to the dog not being home
[00:15:02] <GetShwifty> a part of me is happy thta i don't come home to a dog that got so sad he started chewing his paws to oblivion, but the other part of me is like awwww.. there's nobody here
[00:15:04] <Suchiman> jonp: yeah i always go with that, i'm paranoid that it would somehow magically skip from 4 to 6 and thus never reach the != 5 condition even though that should be impossible
[00:15:12] <GetShwifty> yep Suchiman
[00:15:35] <GetShwifty> and every ONCE in a blue moon, i've ran into a situation where the counter was incremented more times than it should have been in an iteration (usually a mistake)
[00:15:36] <GetShwifty> but yeah
[00:15:42] <knmae> and you wouldn't get nitpicked in the code review
[00:15:51] <knmae> unless you slide it in with 1000+ other lines
[00:16:02] <GetShwifty> i run the place so

[00:17:56] <GetShwifty> lmao knmae
[00:18:20] <Suchiman> xD
[00:19:04] <jonp> Suchiman: it's not impossible; it depends on the body of the loop
[00:19:16] <GetShwifty> if i used git and DID PR being solo
[00:19:18] <GetShwifty> i would totally do that
[00:19:26] <jonp> one "maintenance update", an errant counter++, and… the impossible is possible.
[00:19:50] <GetShwifty> AND when i wasn't in a hurry you would see coments about the Merge/PR
[00:20:02] <GetShwifty> that were attempts at humor or me being critical about code i was merging lol
[00:20:10] <jonp> knmae: i've totally merged my own commits before
[00:20:12] <jonp> and will again
[00:20:23] <jonp> hopefully in an hour

[00:49:58] <lz_> rsync it is :(
[00:50:44] <Suchiman> lz_: create a vhdx of the ntfs drive and copy that virtual drive to the other drive
[00:51:23] <lz_> Suchiman: bold of you to assume I have that much space :D
[00:51:58] <Suchiman> lz_: :P the problem with hardlinks is, that you cannot (easily?) tell if there are hardlinks
[00:52:46] <lz_> Suchiman: it's fucking weird robocopy doesn't copy them as regular files

[11:46:50] <MatthiasVance> Which is good because now I don't have to replace the PSU and board fan right away
[11:48:03] <MatthiasVance> So the printer is open now, making sure I understand what all the wires are. Luckily a 3D printer is pretty simple. This afternoon I'll cut away the glue (which is actually very easy with the tool that came with the printer) and replace the board :D
[12:06:58] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: is that in regards to null checking or what are you referring to

[14:06:42] <Ameisen> I'm dealing with an issue in a game mod... runner where the Gen1 is slowly building up until it collects, and that collection is taking 200-300ms
[14:07:09] <Ameisen> I'd rather just intermittently collect Gen1 myself in that case, but I don't see a way to query how much is actually in Gen1.

[17:57:27] <Suchiman> Ameisen: so the answer depends on the runtime and garbage collector (unity still uses boehm AFAIK), in the .NET (Core) GC, the infamous gc.cpp, pause time is dependent on number of survivors, not number of dead objects. Foreground Collections of gen 2 can be expensive, pause time wise. Gen 1 and Gen 0 are limited in size so they should not have large pause times
[17:58:28] *** Joins: xb0o2 (~xb0o2@user/xb0o2)
[17:59:26] <Suchiman> things that prolong GC pauses are deep interconnected object graphs because the GC needs to traverse every reference
[18:00:01] <Suchiman> (although if object A and B both reference C which references others, it will visit C once when it inspects A but skip it when inspecting B)

[21:51:51] <GetShwifty1> i used ehl,lo fresh, never had any problems with quality of food
[21:52:00] <GetShwifty1> but their attitude was shitty lol
[21:52:05] <Nasp> That still doesn't mean they dont cheat
[21:52:11] <GetShwifty1> i mean i cheat all the time
[21:52:26] <GetShwifty1> most vegetables labeles are 'best by'
[21:52:55] <Nasp> Yes and companies have been taken in relabeling the best by date

[22:30:41] <Nasp> yes
[22:30:46] <Nasp> DoofusCanadensis: I want to netboot mine in the end
[22:30:51] <Nasp> Because those SD cards dies fast
[22:32:33] <DoofusCanadensis> I may have to
[22:32:56] <DoofusCanadensis> but need to figure out how I want to provide that net storage
[22:34:00] *** Quits: pshou (~pshou@159.48.55.71) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[22:34:21] <DoofusCanadensis> but yeah, I think the SD card on my second rpi is erroring out
[22:34:48] <DoofusCanadensis> maybe I'll attach storage to my Mac mini(s) and share it on the network

[22:44:52] <MichaelLong> guess he referres to the same "wear" or generel unreliability, JakeSays.
[22:45:43] <Nasp> JakeSays:  USB drives dies as well
[22:45:44] <MichaelLong> but as we use quite a lot rpi3s and rpi4s, the rpi4s are much better in terms of microSD-card stability. but we only buy "durable" or industrial microSD cards
[22:46:03] <JakeSays> Nasp: no, a usb connected ssd
[22:46:09] <JakeSays> or hdd if that's your pref
[22:46:17] <Nasp> Sure let me buy an entire SSD for each raspberry
[22:46:26] <MichaelLong> I also want to go full pxe-boot of them, but I need to check for a windows-based nfs-server solution
[22:46:51] <JakeSays> few years ago i bought a 120gb ssd for a pi and it was $25
[22:47:19] <DoofusCanadensis> MichaelLong: what SD cards do you buy?
[22:47:40] <JakeSays> also sd cards don't die fast.
[22:47:53] <JakeSays> i have some that have been running for many years
[22:47:58] <DoofusCanadensis> given the behaviour on this one, I'd say it was bad from the start
[22:48:09] <MichaelLong> DoofusCanadensis, have to look up, cannot remember the exact brand/version.
[22:48:26] <DoofusCanadensis> I'd be interested if you recall
[22:48:26] <JakeSays> DoofusCanadensis: i usually buy samsung
[22:48:39] <DoofusCanadensis> I've just been buying what the pishop sells
[22:48:53] <JakeSays> although last time i got sandisk
[22:48:59] <MichaelLong> DoofusCanadensis, something like this: SanDisk Industrial 16GB microSD
[22:49:11] <DoofusCanadensis> 👍
[22:49:52] <MichaelLong> there are also ones that explicitly labeld MLC-flash which is good
[22:50:29] <MichaelLong> but of course the pricing is much higher
[22:50:34] <JakeSays> lol one of LLNL's supercomputers has an MTBF of 6.16 days
[22:55:19] <DoofusCanadensis> daaang

[23:36:12] <Nasp> yes
[23:36:20] <Kim^J> Stop writing a shittonne of logs to it and you'll be fine.
[23:36:23] <Nasp> Which is why i want to netboot and jsut run in memory
[23:36:29] <Nasp> Kinda hard when you need to maintain cluster state
[23:36:44] <Kim^J> Eh
[23:37:15] <Kim^J> People run ESXi clusters booted of USB-sticks in production. It runs fine.
[23:37:35] <Kim^J> Not talking about homelabs, actual production clusters.
[23:39:08] <Kim^J> ESXi is Linux-based, hence, configure it properly.
