[13:18:51] <Demosthenex> that said, i have developed habits to facilitate this
[13:19:31] <Demosthenex> every time i change tasks (ie: across headings in my org doc), or leave and return to the keyboard, i insert an inactive timestamp. you can use C-u C-u C-c !  or i have a function to paste one in on f9 i use

[17:35:29] <Demosthenex> i thought org opened the collapse if it's showing a result
[17:36:05] <steve`> greyrat: use org-reveal, C-c C-r
[17:36:55] <Demosthenex> steve`: i don't even think about it anymore, isn't it automatic?
[17:38:41] <Demosthenex> yeah, i just tested. i collapsed my whole file and did a C-s search forward, it unfolded automatically
[17:39:36] <steve`> IDK maybe there's variables that were changed but I do find myself in collapsed org sections and use it 
[17:40:18] <Demosthenex> maybe its different between c-s and re-search-forward
[17:40:55] <steve`> There are other ways to jump: occur, following links and stuff
[17:42:41] <greyrat> Thanks, org-reveal worked.

[18:08:50] <bob_x1> yeti: yeah. that worked. but it's astonishing what command this keys are bound to ?
[18:15:41] <bob_x1> Demosthenex: do your TODOs are separated between several files ? suppose so. but i remember there was an option to build a time table if you track all the tasks you are doing with timers, but maybe there is an easier option where i would only track when the task set status to DONE and based on this timestamp i can build a weekly report what i've done. but yeah maybe you right and time should be
[18:15:43] <bob_x1> tracked . and yeah ... you right

[18:23:37] <yeti> I had to look up what TAB does because I expected the solution in that circimference...  modifying functionality with C-u is just too common
[18:24:36] <yeti> or was ist S-TAB?   sometimes muscle memory tricks me
[18:25:13] <yeti> and the mode of the buffer influences that too
[18:25:41] <yeti> TAB
[18:26:20] <yeti> accidentally retried that in the org-brain view and there TAB is defined differently
[18:27:12] <yeti> makes sense... emacs... my favourite (?)single user((?) dungeon game
[18:28:44] <steve`> bob_x1: time tables have a scope https://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html. If you want to track just closed tasks you can use org-ql

[21:34:55] <Demosthenex> bob_x1: https://demosthenes.org/tmp/SampleAgendaOutput.html
[21:35:13] <Demosthenex> bob_x1: i bill customers, and if i am ever asked to justify my bill i can send them these
[21:35:28] <Demosthenex> bob_x1: i have one file per project, and i only have my main capture files and support customers in my agenda
[21:35:42] <Demosthenex> i can make an agenda view from the current file when i want to report
[21:35:55] <Demosthenex> there's a clocktable, but i don't use those.
[21:36:13] <Demosthenex> again, i do have timestamping enabled to add a timestamp when i set a heading to DONE
[21:36:27] <Demosthenex> but i also put inactive timestamps everywhere. it's a habit you have to develop
[21:36:33] <Demosthenex> then you can make the same reports.
[21:36:56] <Demosthenex> agenda view, logbook mode (L), and then enable viewing inactive timestamps in addition to normal ones ([)
