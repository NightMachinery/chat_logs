[07:06:58] <euouae> Hello I was reading about block and stream ciphers and I'm a bit confused about the RSA algorithm
[07:07:00] *** Joins: Sofia (~sofia@gateway/tor-sasl/sofia)
[07:07:11] <euouae> how does it encrypt? it's neither a stream nor a block cipher right? But how does it encrypt very large data?
[07:07:33] <MacGyver> It doesn't.
[07:08:03] <MacGyver> It's used to encapsulate a key for a symmetric cipher which in turn encrypts the data.
[07:08:12] <MacGyver> RSA is hardly ever used to directly encrypt data.
[07:08:22] <MacGyver> (Or for that matter any other public-key crypto scheme)
[07:08:44] <MacGyver> In part because of precisely this issue.
[07:08:51] <euouae> that makes a lot of sense
[07:08:54] <MacGyver> You can't use it to encrypt larger than x bytes.
[07:09:11] <MacGyver> Where x is modulus size / key size / what have you for that particular algorithm.
[07:09:37] <MacGyver> (The other part is usually performance)
[07:09:48] <MacGyver> (Symmetric encryption is a lot faster than asymmetric encryption)
[07:10:34] <euouae> yeah and some stream ciphers can even be parallelized and precomputed too! 
[07:10:50] <euouae> using multiple nonces
[07:11:10] <euouae> or rather, one nonce but the right ranges for counters
[07:11:39] <euouae> or... hmm... not sure if keystream generation is that simple to parallelize
[07:11:50] <euouae> nevermind me for that last bit. I'm still just learning the basics
[07:12:02] <MacGyver> It is for CTR mode.
[07:12:54] <euouae> ah that's it, I was thinking of chaining and I was confused
[07:13:06] <MacGyver> Chaining modes have subtleties, yes.
[07:13:22] <MacGyver> I think the wiki page on block cipher modes of operation used to list how well they parallelize.
[07:13:58] <MacGyver> Yes, still does.
[07:14:01] <MacGyver> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation
[07:14:15] <MacGyver> On the right, separate for en- and decryption.
[07:14:28] <euouae> indeed 
[07:15:30] <maroon> RSA and DH are 2 different types of public key crypto - DH gives 2 different ways to reach the same destination, and RSA allows a completely unrelated path home than the path you took to your destination

[07:22:17] *** Quits: frost (~frost@user/frost) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[07:24:18] <euouae> so 4096-bit RSA means a (max) 4096 bit random key is chosen for e.g. AES? 
[07:24:58] <euouae> I can't find a mention of this online
[07:25:27] <MacGyver> No.
[07:25:30] <snappy> a 4096-bit RSA means a 4096-bit modulus
[07:25:30] <maroon> with rsa4096, that means you have 2 prime numbers each 2048 bit
[07:26:13] <maroon> with public key crypto, the bit size is often much larger than the secret being shared
[07:26:18] <MacGyver> It means you could encrypt a message of 4096 bits in length at most. An AES-key of 128, 196, or 256 bits fits in there nicely.
[07:26:21] <euouae> ok but the condition for a message m to be encryptable is that m <= n, where n is 2^4096
[07:26:36] <euouae> (or rather, at most 2^4096)
[07:26:58] <MacGyver> (Actually the condition is more like m = n, because security, so padding is used.)
[07:27:10] <euouae> ah yeah, I'm /not/ thinking. I forgot AES has key size equal to block size
[07:27:22] <MacGyver> It doesn't.
[07:27:30] <MacGyver> AES-256 still operates on 128-bit-blocks.
[07:27:41] <MacGyver> It's just a different key schedule.
[07:27:47] <euouae> I've only seen AES-128 where the key is 16 bytes and gets added to the 4x4 state matrix
[07:28:25] <euouae> got it
[07:28:40] <maroon> have a look at the wikipedia article on rsa, euouae, like i was saying about RSA having a different path home. if you know both of the primes used to create the 4096 modulus, you can create the 'd' exponent. you encrypt like c = m^e mod N, and you decrypt like m = c^d mod N
[07:29:15] <maroon> the rsa modulus length needs to be really huge, to make it hard to figure out what the 'd' exponent is
[07:29:23] <euouae> maroon I just can't find info online on how RSA encryption works. I'm not talking about the modulus thing (which yes, is rsa encryption) but rather e.g. the gpg option --encrypt
[07:30:05] <snappy> gpg has 200+ options, good luck figuring anything out about it
[07:30:12] <maroon> now you're asking for something different than how rsa works. you're asking how a specific program implements it
[07:30:59] <euouae> maroon: still even, reading the article on public-key cryptography, I can't spot the idea that MacGyver mentioned above (e.g. that in asymmetric encryption, a symmetric algorithm is used with key encapsulation)
[07:31:46] <maroon> with rsa encrypting like c = message ^ e mod N, since N is 4096 bits, you can hide a good sized encryption key within 4095 bits
[07:32:18] <MacGyver> euouae: It's the part under "hybrid cryptosystems".
[07:32:20] <maroon> rsa is slow, so if you tried to use it as a 4088-bit block cipher, it would be horribly slow, and probably insecure
[07:32:53] <euouae> got it, great. thanks 
[07:33:01] <MacGyver> euouae: And linked further as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem
[07:33:02] <euouae> that's an appropriate name for it 
[07:33:32] <maroon> so that makes it eco-friendly encryption :)
[07:33:34] <MacGyver> The exact way GPG implements it I don't know, but don't take that as a glowing example of it.
[07:35:15] <maroon> but, asking people to explain how their encryption works can sometimes be the first step in uncovering some dumb and/or bad behavior
[07:36:31] <maroon> oh, so the keys are routed through a server in china, eh?
[07:37:39] <snappy> one of the easier to understand implementations of hybrid encryption is RSA-KEM, might want to look that up
[07:38:42] <MacGyver> (KEM stands for Key Encapsulation Mechanism, a good name for the role the public-key crypto is playing there)
[07:39:11] <MacGyver> (Or maybe method. I forget which.)

[10:22:36] <eson123> before asking my real question i need to clarify something first so when i request my self-signed cert to a CA and ask them to "sign" it, what method of signing do they use, the PCK i assume ?
[10:28:07] <euouae> I thought only the CA self-signs its cert
[10:28:25] <euouae> the root CA
[10:28:49] <eson123> idk man, i have just started out learning how to setup HTTPS for my site tho and most articles online put it in a messy way :(
[10:28:54] <eson123> i could be getting something wrong 
[10:30:20] <euouae> eson123, visit a website with https and click on the padlock and view the certificate
[10:30:21] <eson123> the one i am reading tell me i need to get my cert to be signed by one of the CA but since they all charge tho
[10:30:27] <euouae> it has a lot of info that will help you absorb the baiscs
[10:30:29] <euouae> basics * 
[10:30:46] <euouae> e.g. you will see that the root CA has issued its own certificate, unlike others in the hierarchy
[10:31:38] <euouae> Does letsencrypt.org charge?
[10:31:50] <eson123> except that one tho, they do mention that
[10:31:52] <eson123> but let's me see
[10:33:30] <snappy> letsencrypt is free
[10:33:49] <Peng> Buypass and ZeroSSL offer free certs too
[10:33:54] <snappy> you should try get a certificate through LE first, they're probably more secure/legit than most commercial CAs anyway
[10:33:58] <eson123> i do get the basics already, the thing right now is how to get my browser to actually trust my cert without that "Risk" red text at the top-left of the URL, like i am reading the cert of github.com now and it does say "Issued to", which does sound like either github buys their cert or they ask them to sign their cert ?
[10:34:13] <snappy> ah, never heard of buypass
[10:34:48] <Peng> Their free certs are pretty limited. (Like, not many subdomains.)
[10:36:15] <snappy> hmm so this whole DV/EV shit is still a thing eh
[10:36:41] <eson123> when you say "they offer free certs", does that mean they offer the buyer the cert.pem file only ? like when i try to generate my own cert with openssl, there is usually two files being generated, cert.pem and key.pem
[10:36:53] <snappy> or at least comercial CAs are trying to still sell the promise, but they probably don't mean anything to applications
[10:37:18] <euouae> The one I get for github.com goes like DigiCert Inc (Root CA) -> DigiCert CA -> github.com
[10:37:40] <euouae> Since Firefox includes the root CA (see https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/file/tip/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt), it is trusted
[10:38:32] <euouae> but there's also trusted certificates in your system, browsers have their own as well for extra security.
[10:39:34] <euouae> So github.com asked DigiCert CA to issue them a certificate

[10:42:19] <eson123> euouae: yes but the point i am still confusing is DigiCert CA issue them the cert ONLY ? or they also includes a private key
[10:43:12] <Peng> You should generate your own private key. There is no reason to share it with your CA.
[10:43:21] <maroon> if you dont get a private key, you dont get anything that anyone else has in relation to some corporation's cert
[10:43:40] <maroon> so they'll just sign your pubkey?
[10:46:41] <eson123> Peng: i do, i use openssl to do that, but since my generated cert can't be trusted by the browser, people tell me to get one signed by CA, but still what does that mean, does it mean i give my generated cert to one of the CA that firefox trusts and they give me back the signed version of it ? or go to an online site somewhere and buy the signed cert ?
[10:47:23] <Wulf> eson123: you give a csr (cert signing request) to a ca, they give you a cert.

[10:48:03] <Wulf> eson123: csr contains your public key, some information like your hostname and a signature done using your private key.
[10:49:36] <Wulf> eson123: openssl genpkey -algorithm ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-384 | tee eson.key;   openssl req -new -key eson.key -subj '/CN=eson.com/' | tee eson.csr
[10:49:51] <euouae> Why is there a signature using the private key in the csr? 
[10:50:10] <euouae> Is it to prove that we own the private key that corresponds to the public key?
[10:50:13] <Peng> Yes
[10:50:24] <euouae> This prevents identity theft, makes sense
[10:50:35] <maroon> prevent, such a strong word :)
[10:51:05] <euouae> yeah hehe 
[10:51:37] <euouae> I don't know of any public-key infrastructures (PKIs) where the authority also has the private key, but I suppose it is possible.
[10:51:49] <Wulf> euouae: at my workplace
[10:52:05] <euouae> Wulf, what is the reason?
[10:52:14] <Wulf> euouae: lazy admin
[10:52:26] <euouae> ah. I was waiting for a sophisticated response :D
[10:53:00] <maroon> admin who now has no defense against actions taken by any of these certs :)
[10:53:50] <Peng> There was an incident where a reseller generated private keys for all their customers. And then got compromised.
[10:57:08] <euouae> eson123 https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/ this may help, as well as https://letsencrypt.org/docs/faq/#does-let-s-encrypt-generate-or-store-the-private-keys-for-my-certificates-on-let-s-encrypt-s-servers

[11:15:40] <eson123> hm, wonder if there is any place where i can get a free domain 
[11:16:01] <Peng> Yes but I prefer cheap domains.
[11:16:29] <eson123> i mean since i am just trying to setup a https server, this is nothing related to product, free ones seem good enough :P
