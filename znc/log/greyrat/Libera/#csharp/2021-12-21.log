[01:05:10] <DevJohnC> I'm getting a couple of Intel systems too, Intel is just what you gotta do if you want thunderbolt and I do :)
[01:06:27] <lz_> I just a 12~16 cores system with igpu and 64gb ram < $1000
[01:06:32] <lz_> I'm delusional
[01:07:26] <lz_> new intel cpus have these weird "performance" cores too, I'm not sure if I'm happy with it
[01:07:42] <lz_> maybe I should just go for a 5700g :(
[01:08:26] <lz_> it's a pitiful +100% speedup from my 7yo system wtf
[01:10:04] <lz_> I think I'll just give up and wait some more
[01:10:20] <DevJohnC> if you want a ddr5 system I'd wait

[01:11:52] <lz_> these days there's no upgrading a cpu without changing the mobo and the ram
[01:12:27] <lz_> you buy the thing and then when you want to upgrade, everything is obsolete

[01:41:27] <lz_> I think I might just buy 1x32 and buy another one later when I'm very rich

[03:34:54] <Nasp> Dockers...
[03:34:55] <brianonymous> its helpful for a few reasons

[03:35:35] <brianonymous> twas a personal project tho
[03:35:50] <JakeSays> brianonymous: yeah i'm aware of the reasons, but for my little personal shit its usually more trouble than its worth
[03:36:20] <brianonymous> JakeSays: until you talk about stuff like making a pasty app.. then it could come in very handy in terms of instant scaliness
[03:37:03] <brianonymous> also, cheaper

[03:38:14] <Nasp> If it can't run in a container, it aint worth using

[04:28:58] <bomb> except her hair, her clothes, all the guitars, drums, and the piano
[04:28:59] <Slade> brianonymous, The song and video were inspired by other female musicians, such as Stevie Nicks, Joan Jett and Debbie Harry, specifically, Nicks' song "Edge of Seventeen". Cyrus reached out to Nicks before release, asking for her blessing of the song.[5]

[04:30:27] <JakeSays> "Just imagine her internal struggle to become who she is now and share it with us. Man, this woman is the exemplar of bravery, honesty and BIG inspiration to women. The kind of feminity that is so strong but soft, bold but harmonial, unique but relatable, damn. And her voice just adds a dramatic element to the whole album. The message gets conveyed more clearly and overwhelmingly more than ever. You truly rock Miley!" - wtf what

[05:25:52] <sysRPL> or even `global using static System.Console;`
[05:33:14] <_genuser_> Slade it's also a bunch of california expats trying to make texas into california. heh.
[05:33:27] <_genuser_> and texas liberals trying to be like californians.
[05:33:54] <Slade> _genuser_, fair enough
[05:35:06] <_genuser_> Slade I have discovered senator kennedy basically roasting people from his congress seat. It's kinda super fun to listen to him just call people idiots. without ever saying anything harsh.
[05:35:52] <_genuser_> also kinda scary to see how much he knows about law and all the major cases, compared to some other senators (on either side) that just ramble on without thinking or displaying any knowledge.
[05:40:30] <sysRPL> i was reading about this software company named PopSQL ... they make a web based SQL editor
[05:41:30] <sysRPL> what's wrong with that idea? i dunno, allowing a web based service owned by someone else to connect to your business database server?
[05:44:16] <sysRPL> https://popsql.com/security
[05:44:32] <JakeSays> _genuser_: it's at 3am local, bitch

[05:46:34] <sysRPL> the first point from that security page -> Hosted on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) in the United States across multiple availability zones to support fault tolerance, high availability, and disaster recovery.
[05:46:48] <sysRPL> maybe
[05:47:08] <_genuser_> imo, the non DBA and non-security-expert opinion that I have is - probably not a good idea.
[05:47:25] <sysRPL> i prefer ms sql on linux and azure data studio
[05:47:29] <_genuser_> I guess ssms connecting from your network to your hosted sql or your local sql instance is good enough.
[05:47:50] <_genuser_> but a more helpful UI would probably be much more productive if you were doing more than left joins in query analyzer.
[05:48:33] <sysRPL> the joins belong to the from and as complex as i get is `left outer join`
[05:49:21] <_genuser_> pfft, I even do right joins sometimes.
[05:50:33] <sysRPL> what's the default join? inner?
[05:50:57] <bomb> I like Asian chicks.
[05:51:07] <_genuser_> sysRPL heh, I have to google every time I do a join.
[05:51:19] <sysRPL> i'm not that bad
[05:51:50] <sysRPL> actually i have written so much sql, and i keep everything i write in sql as script files
[05:51:55] <Telgareith> I feel so safe knowing the online portal holding my medical info uses the default ASP.net MVC favicon
[05:52:06] <Telgareith> what other stuff did they not bother with?
[05:52:12] <sysRPL> if i ever have a brain fart doubt, i consult any of my prior big scripts
[05:52:48] <sysRPL> i tried to give ef a chance
[05:53:02] <sysRPL> but i still prefer just plain old sql
[05:53:13] <Telgareith> I prefer plain sql too
[05:53:14] <Telgareith> but
[05:53:32] <bomb> Telgareith do you have STDs, why worry? I have nothing to hide
[05:53:53] <Telgareith> amazing argument there
[05:53:59] <Telgareith> go live in NK
[05:54:08] <Telgareith> or moscow
[05:55:24] <sysRPL> the thing about sql vs anything else is ... if you created table and other data structures with a bit of forethought, it's then easy to use sql to crud either in a sql editor like azure data studio or in code
[05:56:11] <sysRPL> i actually just put sql scripts in my program as resources and load and execute them using sql parameters
[05:56:18] <sysRPL> for all my crud needs
[05:57:42] <sysRPL> and of course i do a little sanitization of user input data in code before i put said data into sql parameters
[05:59:08] <sysRPL> i need to sit down with another core that does things differently and go through my way and his way, then we can both compare notes

[10:05:42] <_genuser_> Nasp doesn't what?
[10:05:50] <Nasp> The vaccine
[10:05:56] <ern> hmm, I should go and do a antibody count again
[10:06:00] <ern> i did before and after vaccination
[10:06:12] <ern> before, 3.8, after 78 something
[10:06:14] <ern> 9 months ago
[10:06:43] <_genuser_> Nasp this one stays pretty throughout. many other vaccines stays much more effective.
[10:07:32] <_genuser_> Nasp but I'm also not a vaccine expert, or virologist, so basically I'm mostly wondering this out loud. I don't make definitive statements about it because it's not my specialty.
[10:07:52] <_genuser_> I work with .NET and have for over 15 years, I do'nt even make definite statements about the .net framework/core/5.
[10:08:05] <ern> One interesting thing is the russian Sputnik V, nobody has complained about it in the west in regards of clotting / dangerous / inefficient.

[10:11:26] <phrosty> unless you're bleeding
[10:11:36] <ern> There are no adverse effects from what I have heard of.

[10:11:55] <ern> However, I think the lots of "athletes" who gets myocardia from vaccines are probably to the lack of information to the patients.
[10:12:27] <ern> The "vaccine" is like a bad infection to the body, a bad cold or something. However, people dont "feel" shitty and hit the gym anyways.
[10:12:45] <ern> So, training (heavy) after vaccine is like training when having a cold.
[10:12:57] <ern> -> bad results
[10:13:20] <ern> I got a paper saying at least 3 days training ban. more if feverish during the 3 days after.
[10:13:42] <Nasp> ern:  I've been told to just ignore all heart related issues from the vaccine
[10:13:55] <ern> Ignore?
[10:14:13] <Nasp> Yeah just ignore if your heart acts up
[10:14:38] <phrosty> are there heart symptoms? i haven't heard any
[10:14:52] <Nasp> Ohh there is
[10:14:57] <Nasp> The younger you are the higher the chance
[10:15:16] <ern> Still, I think that's from active life rather than vaccine itself.
[10:15:49] <Nasp> I don't even think my issues are part of the statistics, nobody wrote it down
[10:16:00] <ern> What happened to you?
[10:16:00] <Nasp> I had to report it myself, but those report doesn't count in stats
[10:16:21] <Nasp> I got arrhythmia for 3 months after 2nd jab
[10:16:49] <ern> That sucks
[10:16:49] <Nasp> The day after the jab i had a resting HR of 130 and didn't feel great and was losing consciousness
[10:17:09] <Nasp> I'm still not sure if it's gone
[10:17:41] <Nasp> I'm waiting to hear back from another person i know who had the same experience, he just got his 3rd shot, and i'm a bit interested if he had to go through that again
[10:17:45] <_genuser_> they could have used the virus itself for the vaccine (like JnJ did, but they're jnj so they screwed it up). They chose to use mrna technique which has been  known for a long while but hasn't been put in production over all these years when vaccines have been underway without any health or economic crisis.
[10:17:58] <Nasp> Because if i have to go through that every 6 months for 3 months, then i'd rather take my chances
[10:18:07] <_genuser_> which means that mrna technique isn't that great. But they use that one in this crisis and then what do people have as an option? nothing. just take that one.
[10:18:16] <Nasp> Was JnJ the one with the clotting?
[10:18:35] <_genuser_> or the jnj one, but the jnj one was causing clotting for women if they were on certain kinds of birth control.
[10:18:56] <Nasp> AstraZeneca wasn't great either
[10:19:14] <_genuser_> JnJ could have easily figured that out, or once they did, they could have easily put that in warnings and told people not to get that one if they were on birth control.
[10:19:16] <ern> I would be interested in see the performance of Sputnik V
[10:19:19] <_genuser_> but they didn't, as far as we know.
[10:19:22] <ern> 95% in San Marino got it.
[10:19:27] <_genuser_> does Russia name everything sputnik?
[10:19:43] <_genuser_> Nasp hopefully you're ok now on the heart front.
[10:19:46] <ern> There is Sputnik Ligth, Sputnik M too
[10:20:06] <Nasp> I still dont get how there's no compensation for the blood clots
[10:20:30] <Nasp> _genuser_: I think i am, but not quite sure if it's completely gone
[10:20:39] <Nasp> But it's subsided enough that it's not all the fucking time
[10:21:13] <_genuser_> Nasp my ex boss swears it's what caused his shingles. He's late 40s. He says his research online showed a lot of people complaining about shingles from the site of the vaccines and breaking out.
[10:21:20] <Nasp> Someone got 500 euro in compensation for getting blodclots of the vaccine
[10:21:33] <_genuser_> but then any of that is quickly dismissed as anti-vaxxer propaganda and laughed at.
[10:21:56] <Nasp> That's the worst part, you can't say you've gotten any side effects before people call you an antivaxer
[10:22:11] <Nasp> And society will scold you if you skip that 3rd jab
[10:23:36] <phrosty> i wonder how many people attribute any random symptom to the vaccine
[10:24:05] <Nasp> Well like with any medicinal triale oyu get a lot of data
[10:24:17] <Nasp> If you look at any kind of medicine it has a lot of side effects like "dry mouth"
[10:24:28] <Nasp> And a lot of stuff that could just be regular issues
[10:24:41] <Nasp> Although medicine can do that, it was just an example
[10:25:07] <_genuser_> Nasp my team's scrum master told me everyone must get it. I told him my doctor said it's my decision after a visit with him. The scrum master says, "Oh he meant you shoudl  take it. You definitely should take it"
[10:25:26] <_genuser_> you got non medical people putting themselves above people's medical care physicians.
[10:25:31] <_genuser_> physicians who have 20+ years of experience.
[10:25:32] <Nasp> Must as in he will fire you or?
[10:25:46] <Nasp> I believe it should be peoples own choice
[10:25:54] <Nasp> Isn't it Austria that's forcing people to do it
[10:25:56] <_genuser_> Nasp he does'nt have the authority to fire anyone. maybe a wet one now and then. Other than that he can't fire much
[10:26:01] <Nasp> Kinda liek most are but they are fining you if you dont
[10:26:40] <Nasp> I kinda hate the "just do it for the greater good"
[10:26:57] <_genuser_> US stats show 806k people died from total of 51million infections. that's 1.5% rate. they generally says the flu is 1-2%.
[10:27:06] <phrosty> i'm pretty sure my work just doesn't allow you in the building if you're not vacced
[10:27:12] <phrosty> you can work remote tho
[10:27:20] <Nasp> The flu isn't 2%
[10:27:23] <_genuser_> yet if you so much as even question a sympton from the vaccine, you're somehow holding society back.
[10:27:26] <Nasp> It's much less
[10:27:41] <Nasp> Have you ever gotten back to work from flu season and 2% of people at work is not there?
[10:27:44] <_genuser_> Nasp that's they were reporting originally. I personally do'nt care to actually argue with anti-vaxxers or pro-vaxxers.
[10:27:56] <Nasp> And yeah i remember anti vaxers saying 2%
[10:28:00] <Nasp> But 2% if fucking high
[10:28:03] <_genuser_> Nasp I talked to my doctor about it and figured he knows my history and can tell me what his recommendation is.
[10:29:14] <Nasp> I dont have a doctor i can consult about that
[10:29:25] <Nasp> I believe it's a decision i have to make
[10:29:26] <_genuser_> Nasp https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html it's really all over the map.
[10:30:15] <Nasp> What is?
[10:30:50] <_genuser_> even with threat of jobloss included the vaccinated percentage in the US is 61%. If you consider people who would have passed if their livelihood wasn't at risk, that number would be much lower.
[10:31:05] <_genuser_> Nasp I meant the flu mortality rate. It's more age specific. So saying 2% isn't accurate.
[10:31:12] <Nasp> Yeah
[10:31:22] <Nasp> But 2% should imply 2% of everybody who gets it right
[10:31:24] <_genuser_> I was just updating my statement.
[10:31:30] <Nasp> Like 've had the flu probably 30 times
[10:31:36] <Nasp> That's quite bad odds with 2% each time :D
[10:31:38] <_genuser_> right, it was 22% I think in 65+.
[10:31:43] <_genuser_> and much lower in younger people.
[10:31:59] <Nasp> It's strange that we can't boost the immune system when you get older
[10:32:20] <Nasp> Cells are bad a keep dividing
[10:32:33] <_genuser_> there's a lot of genetics and other age specific reserach. Lot of papers I see now and then (only when mentioned in regular news) that talk about age being extended to 200years soon.
[10:33:26] <Nasp> Kinda like how we will have fusion soon?
[10:33:39] <Nasp> But isn't the generation being born now expected to be around 100?
[10:33:44] <Nasp> It's what fucks up my retirement age
[10:33:53] <_genuser_> lol.
[10:34:06] <Nasp> I have to work until i'm 74
[10:34:09] <_genuser_> or the flying cars that were supposedto be around
[10:34:15] <Nasp> And that age isn't set in stone yet
[10:34:40] <Nasp> My retirement age increased 7 years during the last 10 years
[10:34:57] <Nasp> Altough i read that maybe my original retirement date can come into play if i put money into a savings account
[10:35:05] <Nasp> And i did, but no idea who i should talk to about it
[10:35:18] <Nasp> I also read i wasn't the only one who found 74 to be a bs age
[10:35:24] <Nasp> Was it 80% of all young people
[10:35:37] <_genuser_> what you mean 74
[10:35:43] <_genuser_> you should have invested in crypto.
[10:35:43] <Nasp> Yes
[10:35:52] <Nasp> Yeah i should
[10:35:54] <Nasp> We all should
[10:36:02] <Nasp> I've bought stocks
[10:36:04] <_genuser_> hey do'nt look at me, I'm holding cryptos.
[10:36:12] <Nasp> How many lambos do you got?
[10:36:21] <_genuser_> also NFTs, you should invest in those too. but most of those require millions.
[10:36:43] <_genuser_> Nasp oh man, no lambos here. I have slowly invested in a few. long term. But I was mining btc when it was 200. lol.
[10:36:49] <_genuser_> should have just bought and held.
[10:37:06] <Nasp> I was mining back when it started
[10:37:10] <Nasp> But never got a coin out of it and stopped
[10:37:16] <Nasp> I also had a rig that generated 1 ETH a week
[10:37:21] <Nasp> It only ran for 14 days
[10:37:37] <_genuser_> well I mined for like 3mo.
[10:37:49] <_genuser_> but eventually I had to buy more GPUs or stop mining. I figured it's taking too much money.
[10:38:07] <Nasp> With current power prices mining is fucking expensive
[10:39:39] <Nasp> Damn just got new prices for my bank
[10:39:43] <Nasp> Shits expensive
[10:40:24] <Nasp> Need to pay for getting a new debit card

[11:00:47] <Nasp> No credability in that
[11:00:58] <_genuser_> apparently their whole spiel is they have no website.
[11:01:03] <_genuser_> it's all done via their mobile app.
[11:01:09] <Nasp> https://www.lunar.app I've considered these
[11:01:10] <Nasp> A bit more local
[11:01:27] <ern> i use wise.com
[11:01:36] <_genuser_> I have heard nomad types talking about those and push those bank (for commission too). Because those will make your money available anywhere.
[11:01:44] <_genuser_> since there's no location and there's not reason to need one.
[11:01:48] <Inge> _genuser_: US banking seems ruthlessly predatory
[11:01:55] <ern> US banking is crap
[11:01:56] <_genuser_> I heard positive stuff about wise.
[11:02:03] <Nasp>  Only issue with these smaller banks is there's a higher chance of bankrupcy
[11:02:11] <ern> They start to nickel and dime now (wise)
[11:02:16] <Inge> aren't they FDIC-insured?
[11:02:19] <Inge> (the smaller banks)
[11:02:28] <Nasp> I think they are required to
[11:02:39] <_genuser_> Inge they all are. If they do business internationally on any level, they have to be able to assure their counterparts in other countries that their money is all legit, etc. etc.
[11:02:46] <Nasp> But i also wouldn't store huge amounts of money there, just the monthly budget really
[11:03:16] <_genuser_> imo, you should be storing majority of your money in a brokerage account invested into market index funds, etc. etc.
[11:03:19] <_genuser_> but that's just my opinion.
[11:03:27] <Nasp> _genuser_: That's what i do
[11:03:33] <Nasp> They also have better limits for negative interest rates

[11:08:00] <Inge> by the way, the "father" of index funds is becoming skepitcal of index funds
[11:08:04] <_genuser_> then there's also the fact, that there's a huge amount of money tied up on shorting tsla and people are just pissed that the stock just doesn't fall.

[11:14:53] <_genuser_> so did most tech companies.
[11:14:55] <Inge> But those valuations ....
[11:15:07] <_genuser_> nasdaq, /NQ the futures, nasdaq based ETFs, too.
[11:15:26] <_genuser_> yep, double checked. it says it benchmarks "S&P 500 Index"
[11:15:52] <_genuser_> are you talking about tech company valuations.
[11:16:09] <Inge> yeah, everything from amazon to tesla
[11:16:54] <_genuser_> I don't know. we're printing trillions of dollars every few months.
[11:17:05] <_genuser_> dollar itself is losing value too.
[11:17:28] <_genuser_> some of that will reflect in the higher prices too. Plus the companies are making more profits and expected to make more profits. at some point it might plateau.
[11:17:40] <_genuser_> but I don't think it will drop to 50% lower just to compensate for having gone wild for a bit.

[11:20:58] <Nasp> Also i don't get the Starlink either
[11:22:06] <_genuser_> description says: using low orbit satellites the company provides video call, online gaming, streaming and other high data rate ability.
[11:22:18] <_genuser_> is it free? does it cost a lot if not free? no idea.
[11:22:25] <Nasp> Well i know what it is
[11:22:29] <Nasp> I just dont see it as a big deal
[11:22:39] <_genuser_> I just meant, that's all I know of starlink.
[11:22:51] <_genuser_> no idea how it happens, and how customers come into the picture.
[11:22:56] <Nasp> I think it's mostly 3rd world countries that will get good use out of it
[11:24:27] <_genuser_> wasn't facebook trying to do that too? It probably just provided free access to facebook.
[11:24:59] <_genuser_> but that's a good idea, imo. if poorer countries and poor citizens in those countries get cheap or free access to high speed internet, they have easy connectivity to a lot of information.

[16:22:17] <Tobbi_> IMO I explained it.
[16:22:23] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Why do you want to clean it?
[16:22:34] <kobo> Is it sane that the API project should have a reference to the dbcontext as it DI's it?
[16:22:45] <Tobbi_> Because microsoft sometimes fucks up when building Blazor projects in-between branches
[16:22:45] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[16:22:54] <MatthiasVance> ah hm :o

[16:23:48] <bpmedley> Tobbi_ : I've done a little with those, nothing very fancy.

[16:24:08] <Tobbi_> Just need to remember to clean.
[16:24:23] <Tobbi_> I actually filed this: https://github.com/madskristensen/Tweakster/issues/94
[16:24:32] <Tobbi_> The extension is nice.
[16:24:42] <bpmedley> It is strange why clean is manual.
[16:25:01] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: You should also file a bug for this behavior on Blazor!
[16:25:11] <MatthiasVance> So, fixing the root cause :D
[16:25:19] <Tobbi_> MatthiasVance: I find it very hard to reproduce the problem.
[16:25:25] <Tobbi_> Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[16:26:08] <pandem> kobo: reference yeah as di is often done in the api project but it should not use the dbcontext
[16:26:56] <kobo> Yep, alright. that's what I thought, and that's not problematic?
[16:27:21] <kobo> I mean it's easy for a dev to just "ahh nice the dbcontext is here right in the controller" and then proceed to do some dbcall from the controller
[16:28:23] <MatthiasVance> It all depends
[16:28:25] <pandem> its fine, the api project is usually the startup project so it refers to most other projects but nothing else should refer to it imo
[16:28:29] <MatthiasVance> Don't use abstraction "just because"

[20:14:35] <sysRPL> do you people use text editors to design web pages or do you use wysiwyg html editor?

[20:16:43] <DevJohnC> I use an IDE typically
[20:16:47] <DevJohnC> but I'm not a designer
[20:18:03] <bomb> visual editor -> designer, text editor -> UI/UX developer, end result: bunch of shitty HTML & CSS code with copy/pasted JS scripts here and there

[20:19:58] <bomb> pff, noob. you're supposed to use tables
[20:21:42] <sysRPL> so in your opinion fixed width layout is wrong?
[20:22:35] <bomb> it's not

[20:24:14] <sysRPL> okay
[20:25:16] <bomb> speaking of tables. it was frowned upon by dumb web designers, because it wasn't "semantic"
[20:25:33] <DevJohnC> fixed width is pretty normal because you can control how your content flows in your layout better
[20:25:39] <bomb> yet they all jumped on the new CSS flex and flow layouts, which provides pretty much the same table layout.
[20:25:40] <DevJohnC> but you still need responsive breakpoints
[20:25:50] <bomb> CSS flex/flow are from WPF btw.
[20:26:03] <sysRPL> or use grid layout

[20:33:32] <sysRPL> i added a toolbox so you can design and reuse parts
