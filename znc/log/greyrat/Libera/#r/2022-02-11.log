[00:24:26] <Bayes> Â > [12:29:15 PM] <fendur> it could feasibly work for you emotionally and financially to grind against the grain.
[00:24:34] <Bayes> I would have thought otherwise
[00:24:48] <Bayes> it probably pays more to go with the flow, at least financially, not so much emotionally
[00:25:05] <Bayes> since_ yeah that's a cheap phrase I say pretty much every week

[00:31:19] <fendur> no you're right it's often easier to get paid and relax if you go with the grain. but some people aren't relaxed doing that, and it feels right and they have a way to make it work financially and emotionally going against.
[00:32:26] <fendur> partners and kids and mortgages sometimes make going against the grain really hard. if you don't have those things, or those things are supportive, going with what feels more right might just work for you.
[00:33:15] <fendur> and if you change the world doing it, you might just find yourself in a really satisfying place financially and emotionally.
[00:33:51] <fendur> i don't think im saying anything you don't agree with. jsut clarifying what i meant.

[12:15:06] <davor> okay, using sep=c(1:16) instead of sep="" works as I expect
[12:18:56] <since_> davor: looks a bit fishy.
[12:19:09] <since_> What do you want to do in the first place?
[12:21:07] <davor> since_: I want to split one column, which contains a string comprised of 16 bits, into 16 named columns
[12:23:02] <davor> http://pastie.org/p/15Nv9ydRRBaXaxC28LI8SR since_ here is a code example
[12:23:30] <davor> only difference between this and what I'm actually doing is that I have many rows like this one in my df
[12:23:37] <davor> but the structure is the seame
[12:23:38] <davor> *same
[12:25:51] <since_> And what is the next thing you want to do with your bits?
[12:26:08] <confuzeus> regular way: do.call("rbind",strsplit(c("abcdefgh", "abcdefgh"),""))
[12:26:42] <davor> since_: this is described in separate's documentation, using a  numeric separator is interpreted as character positions to split at. using an empty separator is not described
[12:27:49] <since_> davor: yes but what is the operation you plan to do with your separated strings?
[12:27:50] <davor> since_: the dataframe is indexed with timestamps, I want to bin each column into 30 minutes with means
[12:28:46] <davor> so that I basically have a fraction of how much of that 30-minute bin was in state 1
[12:29:15] <davor> this for each column (each bit of the string) separately
[12:30:02] <davor> ah thank you confuzeus, this is the base R solution?
[12:30:33] <confuzeus> yep, and you can use the ""
[12:31:16] <davor> nice, thanks, I'll read up the docs on rbind and strsplit
[12:34:15] <confuzeus> also, there is read.fwf for fixed width data which seems to be what you got?
[12:36:45] <davor> ah I also have timestamps which aren't fixed width due to truncated zeros
[12:36:57] <davor> in the raw data files
[13:05:42] <since_> the data is not fixed width i.e. 1101 instead of 00001101, or the timestamp itself?

[18:58:02] <Bayes> do.call(rbind, strsplit(test_df$X, "")) should get you close to what you want, which apparently is one column per string char
[18:58:17] <Bayes> assuming all rows have the same length of course ^_^
[18:58:57] <Bayes> if not, you're better simply treating everything as a long data frame and cast to wide to have it filled with NAs in the "extra" columns
[18:59:19] <Bayes> or just rethink your problem if you think this becomes too convoluted an approach

[23:23:54] <Bayes> I think I commented this before but my rstudio's R session crashes half of the time when I restart it (C-A-S F10), so I'm user to control saving every other second
[23:25:25] <fendur> it's not, like, that hard to implement some kind of autosave to temp file feature, is it?
[23:26:00] <fendur> i mean, microsoft figured it out...
[23:26:29] <Bayes> yep
[23:27:43] <Bayes> most of the times it gets it right, at least for me, but I think they've entangled some RStudio functionalities with the Rsession, so when you Rsession slows down or crashes, a few RStudio functionalities (eg file saving) goes brrr
[23:29:28] <rickyrick> Yeah I was Ctrl+S'ing at that exact moment
[23:33:53] <rickyrick> But I'm just kind of annoyed the save isn't atomic
[23:34:06] <rickyrick> i.e. it just directly starts writing to the file
