[08:48:06] <isf> Trisquel 9 still rocks
[08:48:47] * isf is happy with the computer he have, becouse run  a free distro of the gnu operating system
[08:51:08] <White_Flame> "the gnu operating system", so you have a working Hurd?
[08:52:04] <DiffieHellman> GNU/Linux is a variant of the GNU operating system you know?
[08:53:25] <White_Flame> well, it's its own OS project that utilized tons of GNU stuff
[08:53:46] <White_Flame> but that sounded like GNU without the "/Linux"
[08:53:54] <DiffieHellman> Linux was meant to be an OS project, but that never eventuated and they only got around to writing the kernel.
[08:54:17] <DiffieHellman> Just GNU is a suitable name for the system, but that's not reccommended, as it's ambigious.
[08:55:07] *** Joins: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka)
[08:55:43] <White_Flame> and I was wondering if isf's hardware was compatible with whatever's released of Hurd, as afaik they have cut releases here & there over the years
[08:56:04] <isf> my computer is a 2021 release
[08:56:09] <isf> is new hardware
[08:56:48] <isf> GNU is a operating system White_Flame i use the gnu kernel too
[08:56:52] <isf> the gnu-linux-libre kernel
[08:57:02] <White_Flame> ah, ok
[08:57:17] <isf> my kernel and my operating system are GNU
[08:57:29] <isf> but, correctly the name of the operating system is GNU
[08:57:39] <isf> and the name of the kernel i use is gnu-linux-libre
[08:57:57] <isf> but, for non technical users, for me is more easy say, gnu system becouse that is, is my operating system

[08:59:02] <isf> "What is GNU?
[08:59:02] <isf> GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom."

[17:46:47] <AwesomeAdam54321> Does a self hosted email server need to be up 24/7?
[17:47:55] <alMalsamo> Does anyone know how Brave browser can use MPLv2 license when they forked from Chromium which is BSD-licensed: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/blob/master/LICENSE
[17:47:58] <jxself> Ideally.
[17:48:38] <jxself> Where do those licenses (Chromium and BSD) conflict?
[17:49:07] <jxself> As long as they're following the conditions of all licenses (preserving the copyright and licenses notices of the BSD pieces.)
[17:49:37] <jxself> Those permissive BSD licenses don't demand much beyond that. :)

[17:51:09] <yrk> alMalsamo: the BSD licenses are so weak that you could make the software proprietary, so making it MPLv2 isn't a stretch

[17:51:57] <LibreGNU> awesomeadam54321 dont neet to be up 24/7
[17:52:42] <LibreGNU> I recommend to everyone self host a postfix server
[17:54:12] <jxself> In theory mail servers are supposed to queue up email and try again later if the mail server isn't online. The downsides is that not all do so there a potential for missed mail that increases as the downtime increaeses. Like if it's online 1 hour a day.
[17:54:46] <jxself> And: Even if the other mail server does properly queue the message and try again, your server and the other server need to be online at the same time when it tries to deliver it again. Each server will have its own schedule for when it attempts delivery again, which you can't really know.
[17:55:04] <jxself> SO if your server is consistently offline when it tries again you'll never get the message.
[17:55:26] <jxself> Eventually the other server will give up attempts after a time period, which is also set on the other server's side and you can't know.
[17:56:03] <herd> yes, postfix queue up the mail and try again later if is not online
[17:56:23] <jxself> Yes but you can't know what software the other server is running.
[17:56:29] <herd> also many mail clients do it
[17:56:46] <jxself> Nor how long they have it configured to keep re-trying for.
[17:57:33] <jxself> And your server still needs to be online when it does eventually re-try. The chances of missing those re-delivery attempts increases as the amount of downtime also increases.
[17:59:52] <LibreGNU> awesomeadam54321 just install postfix in your computer, and ready! you have a mail server like you-user@you-ip
[17:59:55] <LibreGNU> try it
[17:59:59] <jxself> A solution might be to coordinate with some friends who all run their own mail servers. It would be possible to have all of the friends listed as a backup MX in DNS. That could increase the chances, as long as one of the friend's servers are online.

[19:38:25] <AwesomeAdam54321> hello
[19:38:56] <Janni> I'm working for a company and we have just taken the decision to put a BSD licence on our code.
[19:39:20] <AwesomeAdam54321> GNUHacker: the smtp ports are 25 and 587 right?
[19:39:28] <Janni> So I'm making a commit that adds the appropriate LICENCE file to the repository.
[19:39:52] <hiya> gnuuuuuuuuuuuu :P
[19:40:17] <ggoes> not LICENSE?
[19:40:30] <Janni> In the repository are however a number of image files, which contain logos that are protected trademarks.

[19:41:24] <Janni> Can anybody tell me whether the licence applies to these files? Do I have to exclude them from the licence?
[19:44:48] <AwesomeAdam54321> Janni: I think you have to add exceptions to the license, the license applies to everything in the repository

[21:41:54] <nmz> so the warranty clause is decoration?
[21:42:37] <jxself> No. Look at my scenario there.
[21:42:53] <jxself> In that scenario you're making a program and are adding the warranty disclaimer.
[21:43:10] <jxself> So anyone getting a copy knows that you're not offering a warranty. It doesn't exist. There isn't one.
[21:43:31] <jxself> If they rip that off that's on them but it doesn't affect you because you've already told them there isn't one.
[21:43:53] <jxself> They go to court and all you have to say is "Well your honor here's the original where I told them there wasn't one. As you can see, they removed it. They're lying to the court by saying they had a warranty..."
[21:44:24] <jxself> Because you know what you did and what you offered, and that there was no warranty.
[21:45:17] <jxself> If they want to remove the notice and offer their own warranty to other people that's one thing. But you already said there wasn't one on you. So that's the end of it. :)

[21:48:08] <jxself> If you never added that warranty disclaimer to begin with maybe that's a different scenario but it's also not the one being talked about.
[21:48:54] <jxself> Rather, it's about you not offering one and then someone ripping it off and then trying to lie and claim they did have one in order to get something when in truth they never had one.
[21:49:43] <jxself> Courts are generally not sympathetic to people when they find out that someone's been lying to them.

[22:41:32] <isf> you never have warranty

[22:42:10] <nmz> jxself: the problem here is, now I have to prove that both my software is original and that I haven't added the warranty clause, so my software now needs to be in some place with a historical record that won't effectively die.
[22:42:20] <nmz> a proof that the software is the original and has a warranty clause

[22:42:48] <isf> no, dude the free software dont have warranty
[22:43:01] <nmz> it doesn't because the license states so
[22:43:22] <jxself> It is best to disclaim to avoid any doubt.
[22:43:34] <isf> the license is just a legal way to take the freedom back
[22:43:36] <nmz> with the clause removed, then (and I don't even know what a warranty of implied merchantibility is) is now in effect

[22:45:47] <jxself> The general idea behind that piece that if you make something it is/would/should be good enough for the purposes it was intended.
[22:46:09] <jxself> Being implied.
[22:47:01] <jxself> It's best to disclaim such things, which is why warranty disclaimers are common in free software licenses because people don't like being sued for bugs in their programs.

[22:47:56] <furrymcgee> implied means it is granted by law, you wont change law with a disclaimer
[22:49:10] <jxself> In some states you can disclaim an implied warranty by saying it's "as-is"
[22:50:24] <jxself> This all goes back to what I said that whether it actually would have existed without such a disclaimer is a more complicated topic and highly fact-dependent. Having them present is a good best practice.
[22:50:52] <jxself> That's why you'll commonly find them in free software licenses, like the GPL too.
