[11:55:15] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Out of curiosity, where do you have the consensus from that irc isn't covered by gdpr?
[11:55:50] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: was said to me personally by geekosaur 
[11:56:06] <tomsmeding> I didn't follow the conversation from ~last friday because of other stuff going on here
[11:56:26] <dminuoso> Just from the wording of GDPR alone, there's absolutely nothing that would exempt it.
[11:56:40] <tomsmeding> he did say "consensus _seems_ to be" (emphasis mine)
[11:57:00] <dminuoso> However, like merijn pointed out, interpretation of the law with respect to fundamental legal aspects can easily change that
[11:57:16] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: To me IRC is not much different from say twitter.
[11:57:29] <dminuoso> Publically and privately exchanging ideas, which are exactly data
[11:57:52] <dminuoso> If what I say is not public data, I really dont know what is.
[11:57:59] <dminuoso> If what I say is not *personal data, I really dont know what is.
[11:58:01] <dminuoso> But anyway
[11:58:03] <tomsmeding> the best source I personally have for legal topics is my friend who's done a few courses in law only -- so I wouldn't know :p
[11:58:26] <tomsmeding> dminuoso: what would you advise me to do w.r.t. ircbrowse?
[11:58:30] <dminuoso> All I know is that GDPR was intentionally worded as simple as possible for muggles to be readable
[11:58:40] <tomsmeding> (which is not a bad thing in itself)
[11:58:46] <dminuoso> And I cant find a single way to read GDPR that would exempt IRC or ircbrowse
[11:58:57] <dminuoso> That isn't to say there cant be, I just dont see it.
[11:59:02] <tomsmeding> and that wouldn't also excempt twitter, you mean?
[11:59:06] <tomsmeding> *exempt
[11:59:13] <dminuoso> Legal interpretation is another thing, but then you're well into lawyer/judge territory
[11:59:32] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: Sure. 
[11:59:50] <tomsmeding> which is unlikely to be the intention of the gdpr
[12:00:28] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl)
[12:00:50] <dminuoso> tomsmeding: If you find some time, try and read articles 1 through 4 of GDPR. 
[12:01:00] <dminuoso> It's very short and very readable
[12:01:05] * tomsmeding tangentially notes that the unwritten customs of when to mention on irc and when not to, in a conversation, are quite interesting
[12:01:13] <dminuoso> My personal opinion is, every programmer should have basic GDPR competency
[12:01:23] <dminuoso> If you're ever going to have contact with EU customers/clients
[12:01:37] <tomsmeding> which is likely when you're in europe yourself
[12:01:45] <dminuoso> Right
[12:01:49] <tomsmeding> :)
[12:02:29] <dminuoso> So yeah, you asked me for my advice: Read articles 1-4, and ideally 6, of GDPR - and then decide for yourself.
[12:02:38] <dminuoso> Takes perhaps 15-20 minutes
[12:03:01] <tomsmeding> will do soon

[15:19:44] <geekosaur> dminuoso, that discussion was in #haskell-ops and involved a libera operator
[15:19:56] <geekosaur> libera believes IRC is not covered by gdpr
[15:20:44] <geekosaur> because it is a public messaging service and you do not give that service personal information with the expectation of privacy, since it is a public messaging service
[15:21:16] <geekosaur> the only thing that can be said there is do not use a public service if you want privacy
[15:23:38] <geekosaur> the other #haskell ops agreed with this summary

[15:36:50] <dminuoso> I see
[15:37:39] <geekosaur> basically I could build the same histogram by logging for myself, no account needed
[15:38:13] <geekosaur> "no account needed" being the key part, anyone can join IRC and gather the same information directly
[15:38:55] <geekosaur> and you don't even need to be a programmer, just chuck it into excel
[15:44:41] <dminuoso> geekosaur: Question, is their opinion vetted by GDPR lawyers?
[15:45:12] <dminuoso> Note, I dont mean to imply that it's not trustworthy otherwise. Merely curious.
[15:45:41] <geekosaur> [exa] did hand the question off to his company's gdpr lawyers, and this answer is compatible with what we got back — but of course we didn't retain them so it's only advice
[15:47:04] <dminuoso> Maybe Ill just put it up on reddit, see what others think
[15:47:32] <geekosaur> I don't know directly if libera checked with gdpr lawyers, but I would have to assume someone has because otherwise there are possible interpretations (like, say, the one you seem to be pushing) that make IRC illegal and only services like facebook are legal, because you'd have to grant explicit and recorded permission. the problem with this is the same would somehow apply to talking in the street, except that's not online
[15:47:35] <dminuoso> It's really interesting, because I cant find any legal opinions on the internet supporting an exemption if there is no expectation of privacy.
[15:47:44] <geekosaur> it's already on reddit
[15:48:03] <dminuoso> The only one I found on reddit suggested that IRC might not be compatible with GDPR
[15:48:17] <dminuoso> But I want to specifically ask about the expectation of privacy angle
[15:48:21] <dminuoso> Not as much about IRC
[15:48:28] <geekosaur> sorry, stackexchange. I pointed you to https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27096/are-chat-logs-against-the-new-european-gdpr
[15:49:12] <dminuoso> geekosaur: Right, and that assessment fits with what I claim
[15:49:35] <dminuoso> The thing is, expectation of privacy is not a fundamental legal concept in the EU
[15:49:52] <dminuoso> At the very least it's non-existent within the scope of GDPR itself
[15:50:45] <geekosaur> then EU users must not use IRC, because there's no way to *prevent* logging
[15:51:02] <geekosaur> just as there's no way to stop someone from listening to your conversation held in public
[15:51:18] <dminuoso> From what I understand, expectation of privacy is usually used the other way around
[15:51:29] <dminuoso> In that you're definitely forbidden of collecting data if you have a reasonable expectation of privacy
[15:51:46] <dminuoso> For instance, your employer cant put cameras in changing rooms, as the employers have a reasonable expectation of privacy there
[15:51:48] <geekosaur> and because IRC is global, an EU law cannot prevent its existence
[15:52:13] <dminuoso> geekosaur: Well, libera could simply not serve EU clients
[15:52:21] <dminuoso> This is what plenty US websites started doing after GDPR came
[15:52:29] <dminuoso> There's a plethora of websites I can no longer reach
[15:52:44] <dminuoso> All with "Sorry, we dont serve EU customers anymore" webpages
[15:52:52] <dminuoso> Simple geoip fencing
[15:53:10] <dminuoso> It's of course a ridiculous proposition
[15:53:24] <Cajun> geofencing a very large population just does not seem more reasonable for only that much more privacy
[15:53:42] <Cajun> cant see that as a reasonable trade off
[15:54:07] <dminuoso> Cajun: They do it because they are not GDPR conform, so the liability offsets the added revenue stream from serving EU clients in some cases.
[15:54:08] <ongy[m]> ti's a legal requirement. If it's determined to offer services, the international legal cooperation agreements will allow EU law to force the providers
[15:54:55] <dminuoso> Turning your service GDPR conform might either increase costs, or make your (dark pattern) business model unviable
[15:55:02] <Cajun> though over here california does similar things, but of course its not GDPR so it wouldnt count as GDPR compliant...
[15:55:37] <hpc> i wonder if anyone's tried making a fake gdpr reverse proxy
[15:55:49] <hpc> all traffic to your service goes through that, so now you don't know if you have EU customers
[15:55:52] <dminuoso> geekosaur: In my opinion, expectation of privacy *stems* from GDPR.
[15:55:59] <hpc> and the proxy company isn't allowed to tell you
[15:56:16] <dminuoso> Meaning, I should just be able to read GDPR, which will tell me *precisely* under what circumstances someone can collect my data without my consent.
[15:56:28] <dminuoso> But Im not a lawyer, so..
[15:56:43] <Cajun> is GDPR not entirely public or is it just legal speak jargon?
[15:56:52] <ongy[m]> mhh, logs and expectation of privacy aren't exactly on the same dimension IMO. Expectation of privacy also applies to non-recording CC-TV kinda stuff, while recording ones are even further restricted
[15:56:53] <dminuoso> hpc: That proxy operator would then be in direct violation of GDPR.
[15:57:10] <ongy[m]> Cajun: GDPR is the "marketing term" of a set of regulations
[15:57:14] <dminuoso> Even worse, you're not only doing data processing, you're handing the data off to someone who isnt even GDPR conform
[15:57:28] <hpc> ah right
[15:57:58] <ongy[m]> that applies to any VPN-Provider. Including the Apple one
[15:58:30] <ongy[m]> plausible deniability of knowledge PII content should help there
[15:58:44] <dminuoso> Right. I mean if its an agnostic tunnel, you're probably okay
[15:59:16] <ongy[m]> probably needs some "legal" front, because otherwise it might be considered a DRM avoidance service, which gets you into other legal waters
[15:59:51] <hpc> it wouldn't be a vpn, it would be a reverse proxy
[15:59:59] <hpc> you don't get full browsing with it
[16:00:10] <hpc> less nord, more cloudflare
[16:01:31] <Cajun> vpns are a whole 'nother can of worms in terms of privacy; most of the time you end up moving the privacy concerns from one thing to the vpn provider. but at least you get past geofencing
[16:02:08] <ongy[m]> yea, vpns are far different from what their marketing says
[16:04:38] <kritzefitz> If a reverse proxy is targeted at a specific website, then it can know that this website processes personal information and should thus expect that traffic over the proxy will pass on personal information.
[16:05:39] <kritzefitz> I doubt that it actually matters here, that the reverse proxy can't actually see the specific personal information.

[18:41:16] <[exa]> geekosaur, dminuoso: re the GDPR people -- additionaly they basically confirmed that the stuff _is_ incomplete in the law, unfortunately "open for interpretation" here means basically "try not to piss off anyone into interpreting that" and likely there's gonna need be a scapegoat to force EU to do something with the policy
[18:42:29] <[exa]> OTOH for IRC I can easily imagine having an extra channel/user flags that mean the consent
[18:42:45] <[exa]> consent needed vs consent given
[18:43:55] <[exa]> technically I can't see how this could be implemented without at least a simple modification of the ircd
[18:45:56] <dminuoso> [exa]: ircd is not the problem I think
[18:46:05] <dminuoso> You could argue that you have legal basis by contract
[18:46:18] <dminuoso> It's still a bit grey, but I can see that argument floating.
[18:46:44] <[exa]> yeah, that's the situation now
[18:46:57] <[exa]> but I wouldn't like to be arguing like that when sued :D
[18:47:11] *** Joins: zincy (~zincy@2a00:23c8:970c:4801:350f:7ee:191a:6f65)
[18:47:15] <dminuoso> Well, you dont really have any other option
[18:47:47] <dminuoso> Though arguably, if you dont employ obviously intentional and evil dark patterns, it's all going to be looked over.
[18:47:49] <[exa]> an option similar to voice here could solve that easily
[18:48:18] <[exa]> channels can then decide whether users who don't wanna be logged can't talk at all or get just omitted from logs
[18:49:08] <[exa]> + some docs around so that the users have the explicit clarification at hand
[18:49:43] <[exa]> (btw I might be solving a simpler problem now, didn't read the whole scrollback sorry :D )
[18:49:48] <dminuoso> The key thing Im really curious about, is whether reasonable expectation of privacy is even applicable to GDPR.
[18:50:19] <[exa]> no
[18:50:26] <dminuoso> No as in its not?
[18:50:55] <geekosaur> don't forget that we're talking about folks who can't afford to retain lawyers; if the question comes up at all they're likely to just kline the whole EU
[18:50:56] <[exa]> it's not -- as I get it, in general context GDPR is more about responsibilities while managing the data, not about privacy
[18:51:37] *** Quits: zincy (~zincy@2a00:23c8:970c:4801:350f:7ee:191a:6f65) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[18:51:39] <dminuoso> [exa]: Right, that's how I understand it as well.
[18:53:45] <[exa]> the whole consent construction is a lawyerism that enables some limits on how far the data goes, and also gives some limits on what the users can sue you for if e.g. the data gets stolen
[18:54:55] <dminuoso> [exa]: That's a funny thing, since there's a widespread misconception you always need consent
[18:55:20] <dminuoso> I think the key is not to put a limit to it, but to provide transparency and control
[18:55:31] <dminuoso> Because you can do all kinds of evil nonsense as long as you have consent
[18:55:42] <dminuoso> It's why google or facebook can exist
[18:55:58] <[exa]> yeah, it's a bit like trying to make the problems explicit
[18:56:01] <ongy[m]> consent is only required for data processing not technically required. though the required processing has to be described properly
[18:56:02] <dminuoso> they just have lawyers who make their "personalized experience" sound so positive
[18:56:51] <dminuoso> ongy[m]: its not required
[18:56:57] <dminuoso> it's just *one* possible way to have a legal basis
[18:57:06] <dminuoso> The key phrase is that you need to have legal basis
[18:57:06] <ongy[m]> what is not required?
[18:57:09] <dminuoso> consent
[18:57:29] <ongy[m]> yea, like I said. Not in all cases
[18:57:40] <dminuoso> you just need to have *one* singular legal basis for data processing. consent just happens to be one way to obtain it
[18:58:09] <dminuoso> interestingly, consent is that thing that your service cant depend on either
[18:58:32] <dminuoso> that is, its illegal to demand consent and make the service you provide dependent on the customer providing consent
[19:08:31] <ongy[m]> well, duh. That's how rights work
[19:08:55] <ongy[m]> and yes, technical requirement, or legal mandate to process them also works. There's not too much that provides the legal basis
[19:10:00] <dminuoso> That depends on what kind of data you have to or want to process
[19:10:21] <dminuoso> If you *want* to process data, this already implies you dont have any other legal basis, so your victim must consent to you selling their soul
[19:11:29] <dminuoso> Every single consent form is just saying "We want to profit off of you, will you please say yes?"
[19:11:49] <dminuoso> There's rarely instances where consent is not linked to profits
