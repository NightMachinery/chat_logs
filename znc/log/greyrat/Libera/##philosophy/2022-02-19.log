[20:50:07] <anomal> absentia: I don't know. I think it depends on the context. In simpler logical frameworks, I think we can accept it as true. But just the fact that something or its opposite is true, doesn't mean we know which one it is.
[20:50:21] <anomal> absentia: which produces the need for a third value
[20:50:28] <absentia> anomal: if you accept law of excluded middle, a proposition is either true or not true, there are no other options
[20:50:32] <absentia> and this is taken as an axiom
[20:50:38] <absentia> but there are logics that don't presuppose this
[20:50:53] <anomal> absentia: well as noted things are a bit fuzzier
[20:51:13] <absentia> in what way
[20:51:22] <anomal> absentia: for example I you either have a cat, or you don't have a cat, but if I don't know which way, that statement for me is in a third state, "unknown"
[20:52:00] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[20:52:32] <absentia> anomal: i would say, i don't know what truth value to substitute for a term representing "has a cat"
[20:52:49] <absentia> but that doesn't mean that the truth values for that same term are anything other than {true, false}
[20:53:01] <absentia> unless again you reject law of excluded middle
[20:54:19] <inhahe_> but as a practical matter when encoding a truth value you may have to allow for lack of a truth value
[20:55:05] <absentia> why
[20:55:19] <absentia> why not compute all possible variations
[20:55:28] <absentia> and simply choose one once you've figured out your truth values
[20:55:58] <anomal> absentia: whether you encode the lack of value is one of those eternal problems of logic and computing.
[20:56:14] <anomal> absentia: in most cases you end up needing to encode it. Hence null, hence Optional<T> etc.
[20:56:15] <inhahe_> not all truths can be figured out by computation. what color shirt am I wearing?
[20:56:39] <anomal> inhahe_: truths only exist relative to some abstract model/framework.
[20:56:39] <inhahe_> or.. "am I wearing a red shirt?"
[20:56:41] <absentia> anomal: the notion of "lack of value" appears nowhere in the definition of the propositional calculus
[20:56:48] <absentia> inhahe_: a priori vs a posteriori truths
[20:56:55] <absentia> or, matters-of-fact vs. relations-of-ideas
[20:56:56] <anomal> inhahe_: I'm sure we can define one such model for your shirt color
[20:57:09] <absentia> however logic being a formal system
[20:57:18] <absentia> is used for discovering a priori truths
[20:58:13] <anomal> absentia: it's very easy to not have it in propositional calculus but not defining the concept of "unknown" in it :P
[20:58:13] <inhahe_> anomal: i'm just saying he can't write an algorithm on his computer that can solve whether I'm wearing a red shirt
[20:58:26] <absentia> that's correct
[20:58:33] <anomal> absentia: doesn't make it useful tho
[20:58:48] <absentia> propositional calculus underlies basically all of math
[20:58:56] <absentia> and large portions of philosophy

[20:59:30] <absentia> this is a very old topic

[20:59:52] <absentia> anomal: did you understand what i said about a priori and a posteriori knowledge

[21:21:45] <absentia> it's not necessary for me to provide or construct an answer to that question, to prove it has a yes/no answer
[21:21:53] <absentia> this is again what is asserted by the law of excluded middle
[21:21:59] <absentia> you are free to reject it
[21:22:03] <absentia> but many logics assume this law
[21:22:14] <anomal> absentia: you're referring to a law you can't apply
[21:22:18] <anomal> What does that say
[21:22:21] <absentia> anomal: In logic, the law of excluded middle (or the principle of excluded middle) states that for every proposition, either this proposition or its negation is true.
[21:22:28] <absentia> I just applied it
[21:22:34] <absentia> here
[21:22:37] <anomal> No you didn't apply it
[21:22:40] <absentia> Let P be a proposition.
[21:22:51] <absentia> By the law of excluded middle, every proposition is true, or its negation is.
[21:22:56] <absentia> P is a proposition (by (1))
[21:23:04] <absentia> By the law of excluded middle, either P is true, or its negation is.
[21:23:08] <absentia> QED

[21:23:51] <anomal> "Models are false" <-- also
[21:24:06] <absentia> anomal: ok, as long as you are explicit in your rejection of law of excluded middle
[21:24:08] <absentia> it makes sense
[21:24:17] <absentia> you can look into intuitionistic logics
[21:24:19] <absentia> i don't know much about them
[21:24:49] <anomal> absentia: the problem is that the law of excluded middle only applies to model that excludes the middle axiomatically
[21:24:57] <absentia> where does it say that
[21:25:06] <absentia> or wait
[21:25:07] <anomal> absentia: because there's no other way to derive it
[21:25:10] <absentia> no, that's exactly correct
[21:25:14] <absentia> that's the definition of an axiom
[21:25:20] <absentia> it only applies if you accept it
[21:25:37] <anomal> Well yes. But doesn't mean axioms are useful or "QED" anything.
[21:25:47] <anomal> I can make a new axiom, that pigs can fly.
[21:25:54] <anomal> Doesn't QED that pigs fly.
[21:25:54] <absentia> correct
[21:25:59] <absentia> "if 1+1 = 2, then I am the pope"
[21:26:05] <absentia> falsity implies anything
[21:26:16] <absentia> but you have to start your reasoning from somewhere
[21:26:19] <absentia> by Munchhausen trilemma
[21:26:29] <I_Am_M00t> i wanna look that up
[21:26:36] <absentia> all arguments are either circular, require infinite regress, or rest on axiomatic assumptions
[21:26:42] <I_Am_M00t> so i can say "according to the Munchhausen trilemma ..."
[21:26:46] <absentia> now you can reject this too

[22:12:56] <absentia> uint8_t <-> binary strings
[22:12:59] <absentia> it is a similar mechanism
[22:13:11] <absentia> higher-order <-> lower-order
[22:13:46] <inhahe_> i'm looking at integers vs. natural numbers as being shifted relative to each other, not higher order/lower order

[22:22:28] <absentia> inhahe_: correct
[22:22:40] <absentia> we can use those bits to express many different structures, not just uints
[22:22:45] <absentia> we can encode ternary logic if we so choose
[22:22:52] <absentia> but in some sense, binary is quite fundamental

[22:23:25] <absentia> it underlies all of what most people would refer to as "logic"
[22:23:49] <absentia> which again was my original point
[22:23:59] <anomal> What about a language with the following semantics:   1) There's an explicit NULL value /undefined/  2) There's an explicit FALSE value  3) every other value is considered TRUE   2a) FALSE is not just a singleton. It can wrap any other TRUE-like value, turning it into false. Thus allowing you to specify context about why that's false, sort of like exception stack traces and messages
[22:25:29] <inhahe_> how about true statements wrap false :P
[22:25:39] <inhahe_> i mean true wraps false
[22:25:49] <anomal> False is a wrapper, true is just any other value
[22:26:17] <inhahe_> why not false is any other value and true is the wrapper
[22:26:30] <anomal> because.. I mean what'd be the use of that

[22:27:38] <inhahe_> well then maybe your stack trace includes why something is true / what led up to it being true
[22:27:58] <anomal> inhahe_: no one cares about "why" when everything is OK
[22:28:13] <inhahe_>  well false can be okay and true can be not okay, it all depends on context
[22:28:24] <anomal> inhahe_: the context is that false is not okay
[22:28:37] <anomal> inhahe_: ok let's rename them to PASS and FAIL

[22:29:20] <anomal> inhahe_: ok screw it
[22:29:36] <inhahe_> trying to wrap my head around it
[22:29:38] <anomal> inhahe_: let's have PASS and FAIL both be wrappers, and every other value is unqualified fact
[22:29:57] <anomal> inhahe_: using non-bool for bool operators then will be straight yp a type error
[22:31:35] <anomal> inhahe_: you can return PASS(result) when function runs fine, or FAIL(error) when it doesn't. Returning a naked value would be invalid.
[22:31:50] <anomal> inhahe_: a bit like an implicit Result type
[22:32:00] <anomal> inhahe_: except it's also used in bool logic
[22:33:22] <inhahe_> that seems isomorphic to returning (result) when it's fine and returning fail(error) when it's not
[22:33:33] <inhahe_> which is basically what programs do, unless you're usingh exceptions
[22:33:33] <anomal> inhahe_: well I just said that
[22:33:41] <anomal> But two exceptions
[22:33:56] <anomal> 1) those will be the only types allowed in bool expressions
[22:34:01] <anomal> 2) they'll be implicit
[22:34:19] <anomal> Meaning you can't do if (some other value)
[22:34:25] <anomal> It has to be PASS or FAIL
[22:34:36] <anomal> And every function MUST return PASS for result
[22:34:45] <anomal> And we unwrap it automatically somehow.
[22:34:49] <anomal> Or something.
[22:35:31] <inhahe_> sounds like it amounts to a more constrained way of programming
[22:35:44] <anomal> Well we massage it until it's better
[22:36:58] <anomal> inhahe_: alternatively we have constants pass/fail and they're always the first result of the function, and further results are either the output, or the error details.
[22:37:42] <anomal> Never mind.
