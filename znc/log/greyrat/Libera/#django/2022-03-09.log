[03:00:15] <superdisk> hey bob, thanks for the tip. I ended up just using `.values` to whittle the objects down to an ID such that Count actually groups them together into one object-- not sure if this is the best way to do it however.

[05:08:34] <bayman> I have a form clean method that checks to ensure only max number of records can be created. How do I only enforce the validation when new record is created? The validation is still checking when I am updating existing records so when I have 5 records, I can't edit anymore since my update view is using the same form.  https://dpaste.org/SDpz#L

[05:23:39] <FunkyBob> how that was supposed to work
[05:23:47] <FunkyBob> I want to understand your thinking
[05:24:50] <yanchai> FunkyBob: i want to validate all radioselect options in the form but by looping the checklists form in template the radio seems to work as one of the entire form
[05:25:40] <yanchai> example in question 1 if i select yes and move to question 2, when i select no the yes in question 1 will be removed
[05:25:53] <yanchai> its like they are all grouped as 1 radioselect
[05:26:03] <yanchai> so i was hoping that i could do a login in the form
[05:26:27] <yanchai> where in ill loop the fields based on the number of questions records
[05:27:00] <yanchai> but i couldnt find a way to makesure all fields are unique in the form
[05:27:22] <yanchai> its like saving multiple checklists records in 1 declaration model
[05:27:43] <FunkyBob> ok
[05:28:04] <FunkyBob> none of which begins to answer... what you thought would even know that method existed to call, let alone call it

[06:11:04] <yanchai> thanks bob
[06:13:30] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: if, as a "normal user" you run 'groups', does it list www-data?
[06:14:05] <oneadvent> lemme try
[06:14:19] <oneadvent> ues
[06:14:20] <oneadvent> yes
[06:14:26] <oneadvent> www-data
[06:14:29] <oneadvent> and oneadvent
[06:14:33] <oneadvent> (which is the normal user)
[06:15:13] <FunkyBob> you should be in /srv/www before you run that command
[06:15:19] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/5PB37U4UF
[06:15:51] <FunkyBob> once again you're doing these things as a normal user that shoudl be done as root
[06:15:54] <oneadvent> that is the output (you can see i'm in /srv/www
[06:15:55] <oneadvent> )
[06:16:13] <FunkyBob> the chown/chmod are to be done as root
[06:16:25] <oneadvent> you have it under the section that says do it as normal user account
[06:16:38] <FunkyBob> yeah, I see now
[06:16:41] <FunkyBob> am trying to catch up with you
[06:16:45] <oneadvent> ah
[06:16:50] <FunkyBob> you don't show running mkdir
[06:16:53] <oneadvent> well i'm pretty slow, should be easier
[06:17:18] <FunkyBob> your original error about making the venv ... your paste shows you were in /srv
[06:17:56] <oneadvent> ah yeah well cause i was trucking through, using some liberal sudos but then i thought that might be the issue, because i'm permission denied
[06:18:01] <oneadvent> so i went back to redo permissions
[06:18:18] <FunkyBob> yes
[06:18:18] <oneadvent> in case i missed something on my hiatus
[06:18:19] <FunkyBob> once again
[06:18:21] <FunkyBob> STOP USING SUDO
[06:18:33] <FunkyBob> you are doing EXACTLY what I warned about at the start of the document
[06:18:34] <oneadvent> lol FunkyBob you feel strongly about that.
[06:18:44] <FunkyBob> and shooting yourself in the foot
[06:18:52] <oneadvent> :)
[06:18:58] <oneadvent> lets take a breather here
[06:19:09] <oneadvent> what is the difference from being signed in as root and using sudo?
[06:19:37] <oneadvent> (plus since it is an ubuntu machine root isn't really a thing, though i guess i could have su root or something)
[06:19:58] <FunkyBob> how is 'root not really a thing'?
[06:20:22] <oneadvent> ubuntu doesn't really have a root user, root commands are accomplished through sudo
[06:20:31] <oneadvent> i'm actually not even sure about su root...lemme try it
[06:21:04] <oneadvent> lol i had to sudo su root
[06:21:08] <oneadvent> to get to root
[06:21:22] <oneadvent> it just isn't a normal thing in ubuntu.
[06:21:24] <FunkyBob> I'll just ad that to my list of "why not ubuntu"
[06:21:48] <oneadvent> i think the idea is that you should have to be super aware every time you want to issue a command that needs root access
[06:22:00] <oneadvent> instead of just being in a root shell
[06:22:03] <FunkyBob> yeah, you should... and most people who reflexively use sudo are NOT
[06:22:27] <oneadvent> yeah, not sure it meets its purpose, i just think that was the idea when they did it
[06:22:30] <FunkyBob> "It doesn't work? I'll use sudo".
[06:22:36] <oneadvent> sudo !!
[06:22:37] <oneadvent> lol
[06:22:47] <FunkyBob> and bang bang... you've shot yourself in the foot
[06:23:03] <oneadvent> so...breather...i'm just adapting it for ubuntu ways and means
[06:25:14] <FunkyBob> tonight I'll see if I can amend the tute to show how it _should_ look (user/group/perms) once you're done with each stage
[06:25:28] <oneadvent> now no matter how i get the command to run, the end result is: https://dpaste.com/8R6VY2WVT
[06:26:11] <FunkyBob> stat... couldn't just use "ls -l" ?
[06:26:32] <oneadvent> um
[06:26:33] <FunkyBob> that looks right, though... owner/group is www-data... and +rwx for owner/group
[06:26:33] <oneadvent> ok
[06:27:27] <oneadvent> dpaste is slow sometimes, getting your ls-l, just a sec
[06:27:41] <oneadvent> drwxrwxr-x 5 www-data www-data 4096 Mar  9 00:31 www
[06:27:49] <oneadvent> (quicker since it is only one line)
[06:28:10] <FunkyBob> indeed
[06:28:26] <oneadvent> now when you say normal user are you meaning the www-data user?
[06:28:32] <oneadvent> perhaps that is the issue.
[06:28:38] <oneadvent> even though the oneadvent is part of that group
[06:28:54] <FunkyBob> no, I mean the normal user you created... oneadvent in your case
[06:29:09] <oneadvent> ah yeah it wont let me even go as www-data anyway
[06:29:34] <FunkyBob> i'd be disappointed (but not surprised) if that user allowed logins, or had a shell set
[06:29:54] <oneadvent> yeah it doesn't.
[06:29:58] <oneadvent> worth a shot...lol
[06:30:05] <llanhmod> it's been 20mins...asking for help. I am currently clueless how to resolve this issue: https://bpa.st/WK3Q   I think I need some leading questions to help figure out what is going on. Shoot!
[06:30:08] <oneadvent> and i re-ran the chgrp as oneadvent and nothing
[06:31:00] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: that looks like environ.py was written for python2, maybe?
[06:31:32] <llanhmod> hm...
[06:31:33] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: which chgrp? and on what? what's already there?
[06:31:48] <llanhmod> I hope not...I've been using python3
[06:31:55] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: 3.10, yes
[06:31:59] <FunkyBob> very modern of you :)
[06:32:18] <llanhmod> will check the file then...thanks
[06:32:21] <llanhmod> its a start
[06:32:41] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/A7J7HZ4LL
[06:33:46] <oneadvent> https://bpa.st/SEDQ
[06:33:49] <oneadvent> (just to be clear)
[06:34:24] <FunkyBob> how about a "ls -la" so we can see what the existing files are set to?
[06:34:43] <FunkyBob> you know, to verify how you messed up the ownerships with sudo :P
[06:35:03] <oneadvent> lol
[06:35:10] <oneadvent> i gonna lock you and sudo in a room together
[06:35:22] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/7S58FJ32E
[06:36:13] <oneadvent> that looks correct to me
[06:36:28] <FunkyBob> no it doesn't
[06:36:32] <oneadvent> oh?
[06:36:45] <FunkyBob> those directories should not be owned by root
[06:36:59] <oneadvent> oh
[06:37:01] <FunkyBob> you were supposed to be  your plain user when you made them
[06:37:06] <oneadvent> yeah that does seem to be an issue
[06:37:11] <FunkyBob> lemme guess... it didn'tlet you, so you "sudo !!" it?
[06:37:22] <oneadvent> lol i actually never use sudo !!
[06:37:24] <FunkyBob> instead of working out what went wrong?
[06:37:26] <oneadvent> i just think it is funny
[06:37:32] <oneadvent> and FunkyBob that could be the case
[06:37:41] <oneadvent> i cannot recollect officer
[06:37:47] <llanhmod> FunkyBob: can you show me an example of how raise ValueError should look in python3? I'm looking at the docs.python.org page for the exeception but no examples listed.
[06:38:01] <FunkyBob> well, at least this is a low-cost lesson in how reflex-sudo can be bad
[06:38:13] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: raise ValueError(value-goes-here)
[06:38:20] <llanhmod> ah
[06:38:22] <llanhmod> thank you
[06:38:56] <llanhmod> oh right...we use the parens in python3 not the double quotes. I thought it may not apply to this case...I get it.
[06:39:09] * llanhmod testing it out
[06:39:35] <FunkyBob> no, you still use the quotes
[06:39:39] <FunkyBob> what you don't use is the comma
[06:39:43] <llanhmod> right
[06:39:56] <FunkyBob>     raise ValueError, "No frame marked with %s." % fname
[06:40:09] <FunkyBob> raise ValueError(f'No frame marked with {fname}')
[06:40:20] <llanhmod> I think I better find a python3 version...there are more than just that line that needs updating.
[06:40:20] <FunkyBob> go the whole hog, use f-strings :)
[06:40:31] <FunkyBob> what is that package even for, exactly?
[06:40:42] <llanhmod> controlling environmental variables
[06:40:47] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/GSSPGZ9YW
[06:40:51] <oneadvent> is that correct?
[06:41:13] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: that's... a bit vague
[06:41:17] <llanhmod> since we dont ever want to hard code certain things...like usernames and passwords
[06:41:26] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: no.. why is code still owned by root?
[06:41:44] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: 12factor stuff... sure...
[06:41:59] <FunkyBob> so like django-classy-settings and cofucius support doing
[06:42:05] <FunkyBob> confucius even
[06:43:01] <oneadvent> https://bpa.st/EVUA
[06:43:03] <oneadvent> how about now?
[06:43:18] <llanhmod> yeah,  I'm essentially just using it to do this: https://bpa.st/3NHA
[06:43:27] <FunkyBob> why not just rm -rf all of it, and start again?  because that's still wrong
[06:43:50] <oneadvent> ok
[06:43:52] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: ah... how does it do any better than the built in env tools from stdlib?
[06:44:28] <llanhmod> FunkyBob: I have no idea...but that is something I should think about in case I am asked. (like now)
[06:44:36] <FunkyBob> :)
[06:44:57] <yanchai> FunkyBob: pls help on my forms.py
[06:45:36] <llanhmod> alright, thanks FunkyBob. gonna find out if there's a python3 version around for that file
[06:46:04] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: any chance you can dump the current version online somewhere?
[06:46:12] <FunkyBob> might be able to divine what value it brought

[06:49:43] <llanhmod> FunkyBob: I wanna say this is it: https://github.com/pjialin/django-environ/tree/develop/environ , but I am not sure. Gotta check the requirements.txt
[06:49:59] <oneadvent> well i trucking along and it working (though I had to install an extra package for ubuntu: python3.8-venv
[06:50:02] <oneadvent> )
[06:50:16] <llanhmod> well, that's pointless to check..its not there
[06:50:22] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: or just grab the file on your machine...

[06:51:40] <llanhmod> https://bpa.st/2V7Q
[06:52:15] <llanhmod> this is totally different from the django-environ...so I noticed
[06:53:22] <oneadvent> hmm might be a good time to make that requirements.txt, huh?
[06:56:42] <llanhmod> FunkyBob: okay, getting the django-environ moved the error back to the database setup...which is where I should be having issues cause I haven't fully migrated the tables. Thanks again for the reply.
[06:57:04] <oneadvent> https://bpa.st/LIYA
[06:57:19] <llanhmod> now...postgres needs straightening
[06:58:25] <oneadvent> do i have to have progresql running?
[07:00:03] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: looks like it is running
[07:00:49] <FunkyBob> did you flub the step where you create your DB user and give it the www-data DB role?
[07:01:10] <llanhmod> www-data? for django?
[07:01:22] * llanhmod thats news to me
[07:01:49] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: it's not required... it's just how this setup does it
[07:01:51] <oneadvent> hmmm FunkyBob i'll google how to check, one moment please
[07:01:54] <llanhmod> oh
[07:02:07] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: all you had to do was... follow the instructions
[07:02:28] <FunkyBob> llanhmod: there's fair reason to instead create a www-app user or something (or django)
[07:02:37] <oneadvent> lol FunkyBob FunkyBob look at how much you can add to this guide.
[07:02:54] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: like "actually follow the steps"? :P
[07:03:02] <oneadvent> (And remember kids: learn from oneadvent, do NOT use sudo"
[07:03:14] <oneadvent> )
[07:03:22] <FunkyBob> don't use it reflexively
[07:03:29] <FunkyBob> "that didn't work... so I'll use sudo"
[07:03:31] <FunkyBob> bad
[07:06:29] <oneadvent> ah ha! i did not do a bad sudo, i simply missed that line apparently
[07:08:18] <oneadvent> and back on track!
[07:08:40] <FunkyBob> given it's 3 PG versions behind, might be worth overhauling that tute
[07:09:37] <oneadvent> so this next step, about configuring the db...is that in settings for django?
[07:11:11] <oneadvent> ah yes. see i hadn't done a db for django yet, i was just using sqlite

[07:36:35] <FunkyBob> not one for details, are you?
[07:36:38] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/FAQPBL72R
[07:36:43] <oneadvent> lol um
[07:36:45] <oneadvent> well
[07:36:48] <oneadvent> sometimes?
[07:37:05] <FunkyBob> you didn't set the correct root. you didn't add the @proxy location...
[07:37:24] <oneadvent> hmmm
[07:37:51] <FunkyBob> and next time the nginx package updates, it's likely to blow away your changes
[07:38:05] <FunkyBob> (yet another reason we create a new file)
[07:39:23] <oneadvent> ok
[07:39:26] <oneadvent> i see the root
[07:39:32] <oneadvent> but whats this about proxy
[07:39:50] <FunkyBob> what does the comment say?
[07:40:50] <oneadvent> one sec
[07:40:57] <oneadvent> i might have figured out what you were saying

[07:48:35] <oneadvent> hey did i miss anything here?
[07:48:37] <FunkyBob> get you an IRC client that has paste flood protection
[07:48:49] <oneadvent> lol i am just using irssi
[07:48:57] <FunkyBob> by default, for instance, irssi will confirm if you try to paste more than 5 lines

[07:51:08] *** Joins: svedrin (~quassel@tiamat.funzt-halt.net)
[07:51:43] <oneadvent> anyway while you were pasting a bunch of lines in irc i went ahead and blew the old default away and started over, and then did the link
[07:51:52] <oneadvent> let me copy and paste the whole file here
[07:52:00] *** Quits: jjhoo (~jahakala@user/jjhoo) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)

[07:56:07] <FunkyBob> ok, and is that the only file/link in sites-enabled ?
[07:56:40] <oneadvent> lol is now
[07:57:04] *** Joins: jjhoo (~jahakala@user/jjhoo)
[07:57:12] <FunkyBob> so it _should_ be the only server clause... which, IIRC, means it will get all un-named requests
[07:58:04] <oneadvent> systemctl restart nginx gives me: Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
[07:58:10] <oneadvent> so i'm still borked, but maybe closer?

[08:00:51] <oneadvent> that is the relevant error
[08:00:54] <FunkyBob> yes
[08:00:59] <FunkyBob> where did y ou create the file?
[08:01:13] <FunkyBob> and where did you link to/from ?
[08:01:24] <oneadvent> sites-available
[08:01:32] <FunkyBob> go to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and "ln -l"  ... I'm betting you may have symlinked it to itself or something
[08:01:39] <oneadvent> that is the original and it is linked to site-enabled
[08:02:47] <oneadvent> https://bpa.st/2FVA
[08:03:04] <FunkyBob> yep, I was right
[08:03:16] <oneadvent> waaaa
[08:03:41] <FunkyBob> my docs say to use: ln -s ../sites-available/mysite
[08:03:44] <FunkyBob> you've used sites-enabled
[08:03:48] <FunkyBob> so it's linking to itself
[08:03:53] <FunkyBob> hence the "too many levels"

[08:12:54] <FunkyBob> yes
[08:13:10] <oneadvent> 404 still
[08:13:12] <FunkyBob> as it's written, it expects a host name in the request,
[08:13:25] <oneadvent> ah yeah i'm just connecting to it via the ip

[08:16:32] <oneadvent> ah it did though

[08:19:05] <oneadvent> isn't that the command i just ran
[08:19:11] <FunkyBob> it sort of is
[08:19:30] <FunkyBob> so no, uwsgi isn't running
[08:19:34] <FunkyBob> did you start it?
[08:19:48] <oneadvent> the line before that is me restarting it
[08:19:53] <oneadvent> it didn't output any errors
[08:20:09] <jim> so I wanted to understand the lifetime of a form...
[08:20:32] <FunkyBob> jim: same lifetime of the request that instantiates it
[08:20:55] <oneadvent> https://bpa.st/Z2HA
[08:20:58] <jim> well hold on a sed...
[08:21:02] <jim> sec
[08:21:09] <oneadvent> i liked the sed
[08:22:00] <jim> so, I see a form, I fill it out, then I'm about to hit the submit buttton... and the action=- for the form is a particular view?
[08:22:12] *** Quits: gkarthik (~gkarthik@2402:3a80:41c:cd85:0:4b:58d0:4401) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:23:26] <FunkyBob> jim: no, it's a URL
[08:23:29] <FunkyBob> which maps to a view
[08:23:39] <jim> ok
[08:24:06] <jim> which is why I need to get that url to work
[08:24:43] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: so... either you messed up one of the uwsgi steps... or... ubuntu did it for you :P
[08:24:54] <jim> but generally speaking, it's the view that processes the form?
[08:25:12] <FunkyBob> jim: absolutely, since views typically do all the work in django :)
[08:25:17] <FunkyBob> (well, handle all the requests)
[08:25:35] <FunkyBob> jim: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/forms/#the-view
[08:25:38] <jim> you two are in the middle of something atm
[08:25:50] <oneadvent> FunkyBob: hmmm well i'm at a loss rn. i can figure out django things mostly but i've never used either of these two programs
[08:26:00] <FunkyBob> we've been working on oneadvent's server most of the day :P
[08:26:08] <oneadvent> lol sorry FunkyBob
[08:26:17] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: so... time to check your steps
[08:26:25] <oneadvent> we can call it a night if you want. i fixed my mx records and it isn't like anyone else goes to my site but me
[08:26:35] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: first, check t he file /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/mysite.ini
[08:27:40] <oneadvent> https://bpa.st/VW3Q
[08:28:17] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: and you symlinked it correctly into apps-enabled ?
[08:28:36] <oneadvent> should mysite.wsgi be personalWebsite or something instead?
[08:29:08] <jim> let's go back a couple steps...what if, I'm at the form, see the submit, but I make an error... one of the form fields says "not valid"...first, what part of this process finds out about the error? this is when I submit, so it must go throubh the url which leads to the vied... so at the view?
[08:29:12] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: err... where?
[08:29:35] <FunkyBob> jim: in a traditional site, that form was served by the view  to start with
[08:29:49] <FunkyBob> jim: the validation is done by the view, so you won't see those warnings until _after_ it's submitted
[08:30:17] <jim> served by the same view as in the forms action=?
[08:30:23] <FunkyBob> in django, it's a Form class that's typically used to handle this validation ... that's their purpose: input validation
[08:30:23] <oneadvent> lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  28 Mar  9 03:53 mysite.ini -> ../apps-available/mysite.ini
[08:30:34] <FunkyBob> jim: the same view as processes the submission, yes
[08:30:52] <oneadvent> # remember to replace "mysite" with project's name!
[08:30:57] <oneadvent> idk what that means
[08:31:05] <FunkyBob> jim: so you GET the url to get the empty form, and POST to the same url to process it
[08:31:12] <FunkyBob> if it's not valid, it re-displays the form with errors
[08:31:22] <FunkyBob> if it's valid, it does (whatever work), and redirects tyou to a success page
[08:31:32] <jim> I made a form where one url and view created the form, and another url and view was the action=
[08:31:44] <jim> so that's not the usual thing?
[08:31:49] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: that's the name of y our Django project
[08:32:13] <oneadvent> thats what i'm saying, mine is something like personalWebpage or something like taht
[08:32:31] <FunkyBob> jim: the advantage of the way I described isyou only have one view that handles the Form class instantiation, and template
[08:32:34] <oneadvent> 1advent/myPersonalSite
[08:32:46] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: there will be no / in it... it's a Python import path
[08:33:06] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: so, in your project, relative to your manage.py ... there is {somename}/wsgi.py
[08:33:18] <FunkyBob> it's the name you gave when you ran "startproject"
[08:33:29] <oneadvent> um one sec then
[08:33:31] <oneadvent> lemme look
[08:33:32] <jim> ok, so my next "project" would be to make a form like that
[08:33:36] <FunkyBob> jim: you _can_ have a separate URL serve the form than the one that processes it
[08:33:53] <jim> I know :) I did :)
[08:33:59] <FunkyBob> another advantage of having it in the same URL... is when it doesn't validate
[08:34:08] <FunkyBob> that view in the docs will simply re-render the form with errors
[08:34:26] <FunkyBob> your approach would require somehow redirecting back and passing along the errors... messy and dangerous
[08:34:28] <oneadvent> mainPage.wsgi.py exists
[08:34:36] <jim> but I want to make the form be the usual way in django, which is to have the same view do everything essentially
[08:34:52] <FunkyBob> oneadvent: it's a python import ... so you don't put .py on th eend
[08:35:11] <FunkyBob> jim: there's a lot of benefits to that process, indeed.
[08:35:53] <jim> back in a bit... mostly to ask how
[08:36:04] <jim> I'll check the url too
[08:36:06] <FunkyBob> how... just follow the docs I linked oyu to :)
[08:36:40] <jim> exactrly, looking for that now

[08:42:50] <FunkyBob> hmm... thought I mentioned in the doc what to do if your project wasn't at the root of your repo
[08:43:54] <oneadvent> no wait, maybe you are right, maybe just under the mainPage..shoot lemme look
[08:44:21] <FunkyBob> ...
[08:44:28] <FunkyBob> so you were just _guessing_ about these files I was asking about?
[08:44:37] <oneadvent> no i got confused, sorry sorry
[08:45:07] <oneadvent> so manage.py is under /srv/www/code/
[08:45:30] <FunkyBob> ok, and the wsgi.py file?
[08:45:32] <oneadvent> /srv/www/code/mainPage has wsgi.py in it
[08:45:46] <FunkyBob> so mainPage.wsgi  is the value you want
[08:46:56] <oneadvent> 404, and double checked that ini
[08:47:02] <oneadvent> and restarted both services
[08:47:37] <FunkyBob> any uwsgi logs?
[08:48:16] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/39A6HBDC2
[08:48:24] <oneadvent> short story: no
[08:49:43] <FunkyBob> ok.. so.. time to manually run uwsgi and see what it says
[08:50:03] <oneadvent> um ok....um....
[08:50:45] <FunkyBob> first, as root: uwsgi --ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/mysite.inii
[08:51:22] <FunkyBob> without the typo
[08:51:24] <oneadvent> ok it working on that
[08:51:30] <oneadvent> yea, i just ignored it, lol
[08:51:44] <FunkyBob> are you saying that's working?
[08:51:47] <oneadvent> it just says getting ini conf from
[08:51:49] <oneadvent> yea
[08:51:55] <FunkyBob> what other output?
[08:52:05] <oneadvent> [uWSGI] getting INI configuration from /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/mysite.ini
[08:52:09] <oneadvent> that is the only line
[08:52:31] <oneadvent> should i stop it from systemd
[08:52:51] <FunkyBob> stop it on the command line, look in the /srv/www/logs/ directory

[13:29:53] <eratiosu> Since recent times, we have run into a bit of a problem with our sessions. Our Customer Service uses the hand-made impersonate function to log in as a user, and perform certain actions for them. Since last week, we have seen a change in behavior, as a logged out CS agents.
[13:30:23] <eratiosu> This happens when you log in as a diff user and refresh the page, is clears the entire session. I made a gist with the impersonation: https://gist.github.com/Thorbenl/d323f99732fb4d6020e1bb85847a8417
[13:30:40] <eratiosu> We are using redis as a cache backend, and running version 5.0.12 there.
[13:32:10] <eratiosu> Any obvious pointers we could look at? It works flawlessly without adding redis, and using the inbuilt cached backend, but as soon you add redis back, it fails. We have EVICTION POLICY: volatile-lru set on our redis
[13:34:12] <eratiosu> We have been stuck with this for quite a while, and ruled out most of the other things too. But since this is using normal Django login and logout, with assume it either must be redis, or our impersonation.
[13:34:45] <eratiosu> But its quit critical, as the customer service agents get just randomly logged out, and their session is cleared
[13:44:14] <eratiosu> But further testing shows it can be redis.. so we are out of ideas on why a user gets logged out of the django platform when impersonating somehow
[13:50:04] <FunkyBob> that is a frighteningly dangerous view
[13:52:31] <eratiosu> In what sense? :D
[13:53:09] <FunkyBob> there's absolutely not authentication protection, for a start
[13:53:24] <FunkyBob> an anonymous user could use it t o impersonate anyone
[13:55:37] <FunkyBob> and it trusts  the Referer header... ick
[13:56:58] <yanchai> FunkyBob: im stucked :(
[13:58:15] <eratiosu> @FunkyBob: that view is behind a custom auth, so you need to be staff in order to use that view, otherwise u get a 403
[13:59:30] <eratiosu> which is flag on the django user

[14:00:51] <eratiosu> But anyway, what are you guys suggesting could be the issue here? It started failing only last week, and worked before. Nothing updated/upgraded in django sites, we have been on 4.0.3 for a while. and this was never an issue. SO idk if it its even django related
[14:00:53] <FunkyBob> and yet the view internally behaves differently if you're staff or not

[14:01:16] <FunkyBob> well, if nothing's changed, the behavior won't change
[14:01:20] <FunkyBob> so... something's changed
[14:02:02] <eratiosu> Figured, but what could it be..? Django stores the session in redis AND the DB, right? So if it logs us out, it means something must have changes in either redis or the db

[14:02:40] <eratiosu> also, it happens only in Chrome, afaik, not in other browsers
[14:03:11] <FunkyBob> chrome, or chromium?
[14:03:15] <pycode> guys, i need to create general permissions like "can_create_report" i do not have a Report model so, where should i create that permission? should i add it on the User table? how can i handle "general" permission? i have seen i must refer to a Model, so what can i do in that case?
[14:03:34] <FunkyBob> because I have an issue in chromium with google logging me out repeatedly every day... could be related

[14:04:37] <FunkyBob> there are differences
[14:04:51] <FunkyBob> no, it _shouldn't_ matter... but shouldn't doesn't mean won't
[14:04:57] <eratiosu> yeah, agreed
[14:05:03] <FunkyBob> and google are fuckheads... so yes, it will mean differences
[14:06:54] <eratiosu> Yeah, we could try reproducing it with chromium
[14:07:11] <FunkyBob> if you haven't already, probably not work complicating
[14:08:54] <eratiosu> i mean, it is preventing most of our business from working but yeah
[14:09:18] <eratiosu> I could be google auth related, since our customer service log into google to use our impersonating
[14:11:52] <eratiosu> I could assume google fucks with the session ID somehow, after a CS user logs in, using google auth, but it shouldnt... be allowed to termper with djangos sessionid cookie

[16:19:25] <SpecialK> theprophet: why would you not want to use requests?
[16:19:51] <SpecialK> you can use the python stdlib, but requests is very good
[16:19:56] <theprophet> just curious if it is possbile, i am practicing and i am curious
[16:20:07] <theprophet> i see
[16:20:33] <theprophet> so simple GET wont work like it does for querys?
[16:20:50] <SpecialK> you can, yes
[16:21:06] <theprophet> without stdlib or with?
[16:22:15] <SpecialK> stdlib is an abbreviation of "standard library" i.e. the core stuff with Python
[16:22:26] <theprophet> i see
[16:22:31] <SpecialK> you almost certainly don't want to build your own stdlib
[16:22:43] <SpecialK> you can go make HTTP requests with https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html
[16:22:54] <SpecialK> but requests is good, and I'm not clear why you wouldn't want to use it
[16:23:30] <theprophet> i am not against it, i am just curious if its possible in general
[16:24:17] <SpecialK> It's absolutely possible
[16:24:39] <SpecialK> Libraries are less about "making it possible" and more about "making it easy"
[16:25:08] <theprophet> not this time, but sometimes i want to invent a wheel
[16:25:15] <SpecialK> Sure
[16:25:15] <theprophet> again
[16:25:26] <SpecialK> You may also want #python though - none of this seems Django-related

[18:17:19] <yanchai> in the checklist model there are 2 foreignkeys question_id and declaration_id
[18:17:20] <theprophet> i think what you want is called radio buttons in templates  type='radio'
[18:18:02] <theprophet> or <button type='radio'>
[18:18:16] <yanchai> yes i implemented it in the form but since i am looping the same field based on the number of questions from the other model it seems like they are groupd as one
[18:18:41] <yanchai> its like you can only select 1 from the entire questions list
[18:18:47] <theprophet> so split them with for loop in templates

[23:13:58] <theprophet> GinFuyou gin i got very small question, how come that request cannot retrieve data from web api but requests does?
[23:14:18] <theprophet> GinFuyou whats the main difference here?
[23:14:37] <theprophet> theres litteraly 0 result for google search about this
[23:31:03] <SpecialK> theprophet: what request?
[23:31:23] <theprophet> SpecialK remember i asked you today?
[23:31:49] <SpecialK> theprophet: you asked a very general question,
[23:31:56] <SpecialK> nothing about a specific request
[23:32:16] <theprophet> well , installed package called requests, works with grabbing api objects on site
[23:32:22] <theprophet> but the stock request does not
[23:32:38] <SpecialK> what's "the stock request"?
[23:32:40] <theprophet> which we mostly use to request from query
[23:32:46] <theprophet> stndlib
[23:32:47] <SpecialK> per topic, code and traceback please
[23:33:24] <theprophet> standart library request
[23:33:30] <theprophet> which we use in django
[23:33:42] <theprophet> does not pull objects from api site
[23:33:45] <SpecialK> theprophet: per topic, code and traceback please
[23:35:03] <theprophet> SpecialK ok first look at this https://ibb.co/5csdDyD
[23:35:20] <theprophet> this is my view, page is working , but page 2 is not
[23:35:41] <theprophet> ok so i will now traceback of page 2 when i am trying to retrieve data from api site
[23:35:53] <SpecialK> theprophet: what are the imports
[23:36:23] <SpecialK> oh
[23:36:24] <theprophet> i am not using any standart library
[23:36:34] <SpecialK> theprophet: `request` there is a Django Request object
[23:36:45] <theprophet> yes
[23:36:48] <SpecialK> which represents an inbound request
[23:36:51] <theprophet> request vs requests
[23:36:55] <SpecialK> it doesn't let you make outbound requests
[23:37:16] <theprophet> yes if you look closely when i asked in the start , theres extra S letter
[23:37:19] <SpecialK> that's just a parameter passed to a view function that we conventionally call "request" because it represents the incoming request
[23:37:24] <SpecialK> you could just call it "bob"
[23:37:42] <SpecialK> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/request-response/
[23:37:45] <theprophet> ojjj
[23:37:46] <theprophet> ohhh
[23:37:55] <SpecialK> "Django uses request and response objects to pass state through the system."
[23:37:58] <theprophet> rightt, i remember that, i forgot it
[23:38:27] <theprophet> dang it , i learned that but so long ago that i forgot
[23:38:37] <SpecialK> the fact there is a library for *making* HTTP requests called `requests` is entirely incidental
[23:39:08] <theprophet> i see
[23:39:11] <theprophet> so what does
[23:39:22] <theprophet> i mean
[23:39:27] <theprophet> what is happening behind
[23:39:34] <theprophet> request.GET then?
[23:39:58] <theprophet> how is parameter binds with GET?
[23:40:31] <SpecialK> theprophet: from the page I just linked you to: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.GET - "A dictionary-like object containing all given HTTP GET parameters."
[23:41:07] <theprophet> oh ok, ill read that
[23:41:39] <theprophet> HttpRequest and request are same? SpecialK
[23:41:49] <theprophet> cause the name here is HttpRequest
[23:41:49] <SpecialK> theprophet: depends
[23:41:58] <SpecialK> theprophet: I think you need to get more familiar with Python
[23:42:17] <theprophet> wait why ?
[23:42:21] <SpecialK> theprophet: `request` is the name you have chosen for the HttpRequest instance passed to `page2` - it is the conventional name
[23:42:22] <theprophet> what am i missing ?
[23:42:25] <theprophet> what u mean depends?
[23:42:39] <theprophet> thats python?
[23:42:52] <theprophet> is HTTP a python?
[23:43:05] <theprophet> is not that like a general internet thing?
[23:43:09] <SpecialK> "is HTTP a python" doesn't feel like it makes sense as a question
[23:43:47] <theprophet> no, you said i need to get more familiar with python, after i asked if httprequest and requests were same and u said depends
[23:43:52] <theprophet> and thats where i got lost
[23:44:02] <SpecialK> yes; you seem confused about the difference between a parameter and a class
[23:44:19] <SpecialK> but no the question you asked was "HttpRequest and request"
[23:44:31] <theprophet> i see
[23:45:40] <theprophet> ok, thank you
[23:45:50] <theprophet> ill read that django doc
[23:46:18] <SpecialK> for HttpRequest and *requests*; one is a class provided by the Django library, the other is a library
[23:46:51] <theprophet> so its a python
[23:46:54] <theprophet> not a django
[23:47:14] <SpecialK> What is "it" and what does it mean for something to be "a python"?
[23:47:50] <SpecialK> all of the above is Python; HttpRequest is a Django class, Django is a Python library; requests is a Python library
[23:47:53] <theprophet> for me, saying its a python means i can use it outside django
[23:48:09] <theprophet> and saying it is django, i mean use it only inside django
[23:48:13] <SpecialK> Right; I think other people may struggle with your terminology there, but I understand it now
[23:48:27] <SpecialK> (you might try "a part of X" not just "a X")
[23:48:27] <theprophet> sorry
[23:48:44] <SpecialK> (although actually that's not the right wording either, hm)
[23:49:29] <theprophet> i mean, when i speak about python, i am not saying its a python thing since chat is called #python
[23:49:38] <theprophet> and same with #django
[23:49:56] <theprophet> its obvious for me, but ill be more specific here, next time.
[23:51:02] <theprophet> guess, ur right , and its hard to understand my terminology yes. ill have that in mind 100%
[23:51:07] <SpecialK> Thanks
[23:51:22] <theprophet> no, thank you
[23:51:25] <theprophet> for helping me
