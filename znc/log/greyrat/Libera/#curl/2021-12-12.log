[00:26:31] <eternal_peril> Hi...I asked this last night but I want to streamline it a bit.  I have a curl command with a digest login.    When I send the curl to grab what I want, i get two messages, first a 401/Unauthorized, then immediately after a successful login (within the same command)  is there any way to supress the 401/Unauthorized output   so I don't see it
[00:26:31] <eternal_peril> on the screen
[00:26:59] <bagder> why do you see the 401 at all?
[00:27:04] <bagder> with -i?
[00:27:28] <eternal_peril> no idea...something with the device I'm using.  Always gives me a 401
[00:27:31] <eternal_peril> no matter what I do

[00:28:36] <eternal_peril> this, every time:  https://pastebin.com/MWGVMz51
[00:29:08] <bagder> but isn't that what you get with digest?
[00:29:15] <bagder> it's a challenge response auth
[00:30:43] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:6946:301f:4093:a99:4144)
[00:30:51] <eternal_peril> which is fine
[00:30:59] <eternal_peril> I just want to supress the messaeg
[00:31:03] <eternal_peril> message
[00:31:19] <bagder> but why do you view that "message" at all? they're headers you can ignore
[00:32:37] <eternal_peril> I am trying to set up this command to create a mjpeg server from static images
[00:33:08] <eternal_peril> so it loops ever 0.2 seconds and refreshes.   I have a different camera that doesn't do that and I get what I need...that extra 401 unauthorized messes up the jpg image i'm getting
[00:33:25] <bagder> so again, why do you care about the headers?
[00:33:40] <bagder> aren't you just saving the body?
[00:34:06] <eternal_peril> yup but when I remove -i  the image doesn't show
[00:34:14] <eternal_peril> I get nothing
[00:34:35] <bagder> that doesn't make a lot of sense
[00:35:01] <eternal_peril> I agree
[00:35:54] <eternal_peril> without -i  I get nothing, with -i I get this:
[00:35:55] <eternal_peril> HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: image/jpeg; charset="UTF-8" Connection: close Content-Length:128704 яШяаJFIFяЫC 2!=,.$2I@LKG@FEPZsbPUmVEFd€emw
[00:36:58] <eternal_peril> when I do just a -s  rather than a -is   the browser tries to download the bash script i'm using
[00:37:45] <bagder> remove the -s and you'll see an error message
[00:37:56] <bagder> you're sending binary gunk to the terminal I guess
[00:38:15] <bagder> you probably rather want to save that to a file
[00:38:19] *** Quits: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:38:39] <bagder> or use -o - if you insist on getting it to the terminal
[00:39:44] <eternal_peril> it does work with a different camera though.  Works perfectly.   Just this one brand
[00:40:08] <bagder> what works?
[00:40:17] <eternal_peril> the command
[00:40:37] <eternal_peril> I don't get the 401/Unauth  and in the browser I get an image automatically refreshing every 0.2 seconds
[00:40:45] <bagder> you're not making it very easy to help you...
[00:40:58] <eternal_peril> I'm trying...been beating my head against this for 2 days now. Sorry
[00:41:12] <eternal_peril> On one type, I do not get the 401, so I get my binary data on screen perfectly
[00:41:21] <Piru> the way you present the problem is super confusing
[00:41:27] <bagder> but that doesn't use digest then
[00:41:27] <eternal_peril> on this type, because it starts with the 401 error, it messes up the stream
[00:41:33] <eternal_peril> correct
[00:41:40] <eternal_peril> my issue is with Digest
[00:41:49] <bagder> no
[00:42:00] <bagder> your issue is with you sending the headers
[00:42:21] <bagder> digest will get a 401 back, you can't avoid it
[00:42:39] <eternal_peril> So how can I correct it to ignore the 401 on the output?
[00:42:44] <bagder> remove -i
[00:43:27] <eternal_peril> when I remove -i    the web browser tries to download the bash script
[00:43:35] <eternal_peril> rather than displaying the binary on screen
[00:43:47] <bagder> now you're skipping a few steps you haven't told us about
[00:43:59] <bagder> curl without -i does not run a browser
[00:44:42] <Piru> eternal_peril: we can't read minds. you have to explain what you try to do
[00:45:00] <eternal_peril> I am trying to take a static jpg image from a web camera and convert it into a mjpeg stream
[00:45:16] <bagder> yes, and "curl -o image $URL" will do that for you
[00:45:31] <bagder> (plus a few auth options)
[00:45:46] <bagder> I mean, save a single URL/image to a file 
[00:46:13] <Piru> eternal_peril: I think I understand what the issue is. you get other than jpeg data to stdout in some situations?
[00:46:22] <eternal_peril> yes!
[00:46:58] <Piru> well the only way to do this bulletproof would be to filter out non-jpeg data
[00:47:14] <eternal_peril> so when I remove the -i as per bagder and remove the boundry I added to the bash script  I am getting an image now!  However, it is not automatically refreshing
[00:47:17] <Piru> since the server can send you whatever it wants all the sudden
[00:47:41] <Piru> but this very much doesn't sound like a curl problem
[00:47:56] <Piru> curl returns whatever the server returns
[00:48:26] <eternal_peril> not a curl problem but i'm hoping I can find a solution.   I am closer now that I am getting an image, its just not refreshing
[00:49:00] <bagder> what does refreshing mean here?
[00:49:23] <eternal_peril> my script is in a while loop.  So very 0.2 seconds, it starts over to grab an updated jpg
[00:50:10] <Piru> so does the server return changed images?
[00:50:27] <eternal_peril> if I manually refresh, now yes
[00:50:33] <Piru> I didn't ask that
[00:50:34] <eternal_peril> but not automatically
[00:50:56] <Piru> I asked if the server actually changes different data for each "frame"
[00:51:00] <eternal_peril> yes
[00:51:05] <eternal_peril> I have a clock on there with seconds
[00:51:08] <Piru> well, then this is not a curl problem
[00:51:47] <Piru> or at least I can't possibly see how this could be
[00:52:10] <eternal_peril> its a scripting issue I think at this point    farther along than I was
[00:52:40] <eternal_peril> but any suggestions would be appreciated

[00:59:08] <Piru> well i think the issue is that you need to create valid headers
[01:00:10] <Piru> browser likely expects content-type and content-length .. but not sure

[01:01:49] *** Quits: Trieste (T@user/pilgrim) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:02:01] <Piru> well there likely is some header there that b0rks it
[01:02:49] <Piru> hence it'd be "safer" to fetch a image and then use echo to send the content-type and content-length headers yourself
[01:04:16] <Piru> that way you'
[01:04:29] <Piru> you're in control of the headers that get sent out and the server can't interfere

[16:40:33] * Piru curses cmake
[16:40:47] <Piru> it has TOCTOU bugs
[16:41:19] <Piru> webkit build just started to fail. it heavily uses concurrency in the build (we don't have days to wait for the build)
[16:41:27] <quinq> And it's bloody hard to debug
[16:42:00] <Piru> so there's CopyFileIfDifferent routine
[16:42:15] <Piru> it checks if files are different. if they are it copies the file over
[16:42:25] <Piru> check first. copy after
[16:42:29] <quinq> haha
[16:42:34] * Piru facepalms
[16:42:59] <Piru> if concurrency happens to work on the same dest it totally barfs
[16:43:18] <Piru> so as it happens
[16:43:19] <Piru> [  1%] Generating ../../DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins_generate_combined_implementation.py
[16:43:22] <Piru> [  1%] Generating ../../DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins_generate_combined_implementation.py
[16:44:16] <quinq> Well, tbf it's also a questions of correctly maintaining dependencies
[16:44:17] <Piru> and then
[16:44:18] <Piru> Error copying file (if different) from "/home/xxx/morphos.build.head/morphos/morphoswb/apps/webkit/Source/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/wkbuiltins/builtins_generate_combined_implementation.py" to "/home/xxx/morphos.build.head/morphos/morphoswb/apps/webkit/cross-build-mini/DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins_generate_combined_implementation.py".
[16:44:23] <Piru> make[9]: *** [Source/JavaScriptCore/CMakeFiles/JavaScriptCoreSharedScripts.dir/build.make:117: DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins_generate_combined_implementation.py] Error 1
[16:44:27] <quinq> A single file shouldn't be the result of different operations
[16:44:27] <Piru> make[9]: *** Deleting file 'DerivedSources/ForwardingHeaders/JavaScriptCore/Scripts/builtins_generate_combined_implementation.py'
[16:44:33] <Piru> note that it also deletes the target file
[16:44:42] <Piru> ensuring that the 2nd copy WILL fail
[16:46:26] <Piru> I hate cmake and this is yet another reason to
[16:47:20] <quinq> :D
[16:47:25] <Piru> my fugly fix: if copy fails, make it delay a bit and try again
[16:47:45] <quinq> I remember getting on the webkitgtk irc channel and telling that the debug build was broken with some configure option
[16:48:00] <quinq> The answer was something like “oh yeah, you're not supposed to configure your debug build”

[16:51:08] <Piru> ok restarted a build with the patch in place... lets see if that helps
[16:51:42] <Piru> the build has been running for years btw. no issues whatsoever around here. and now it failed twice in a row
[16:54:55] <Piru> of course nothing has changed in the build system or the code around this issue
