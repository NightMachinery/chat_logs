[00:38:18] <Friithian> well that was some fun insanity
[00:39:49] <rob0> I think it's the first time we have needed a ban in here.
[00:40:35] <Friithian> whew
[00:40:52] <Friithian> I dont even know how to ban someone and I run a channel…
[00:43:48] <rob0> heh, neither does thumbs ;) ... had a typo in the one ban :)
[00:44:10] <Friithian> lmao
[00:45:00] <rob0> seriously he knows more than I do.  I'm not even sure how to list bans in this client!
[00:46:51] <Friithian> it would take me 5 minutes to figure out how to op myself lol

[06:10:27] <pj> lunaphyte: because you have the +O flag set.
[06:10:57] <pj> +o allows you to have ops, +O is auto-ops

[06:56:10] <Friithian> voicing an unregistered nick? sounds smart
[06:57:32] <pj> Friithian: we auto-voice matrix users who are not registered with nickserv.  Since they have to be registered with matrix and matrix passes their account name through to IRC we can still ban them by their matrix account name.
[06:57:53] <Friithian> ok for that I can see it
[06:58:22] <lunaphyte> and there are occasions where we have and may voice individuals on a case by case basis
[06:58:24] <pj> also occasionally we've had an unregistered user come into the channel and ask one of the ops if he can participate, and I'm generally fine with voicign them temporarily so they can get one-time help without needing to register.

[14:51:52] <Khepra> I gotta say... there's spam filtering one can understand and decent MX offer ways for easy clarification and delisting of misplaced entries. And then there's the morons of t-online.de. who are also asking for payment to get whitelisted. I'mma go consult lawyers to see if this s extortion under any EU legal provision.
[14:52:24] *** Joins: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor)
[15:00:09] <jelly> where does it say they're asking for payment?
[15:02:46] <Khepra> in their email recommending us to become members of CSA
[15:02:54] <jelly> https://postmaster.t-online.de/index.en.html#t4.11 blah blah does not offer whitelisting
[15:03:33] <Khepra> sure. it says that. then they refuse to delist you even though you're not spamming, and are not blacklisted in any of the RBLs and then they recommend CSA.
[15:06:40] <jelly> I'm under contractual obligation not to say this is patently dumb if true
[15:13:48] <Khepra> another gem. I have an email addr in a client's domain hosted at GSuite. Now I can't login. GMail says I must verify if this is _really_ me. So how do I verify? By providing a phone number they do NOT have on record (and thus can't tell it's mine) so they can send me an SMS.
[15:14:47] <Khepra> google warship go.... yourself.
[15:15:46] <pj> Microsoft does the same thing with the return path whitelist.
[15:19:11] <pj> although they call it a "certification program".
[15:20:21] <Khepra> I can't tell if they're just too dumb, or this is a "conspiracy" to get all of our phone numbers for some reason.
[15:21:48] <pj> It's google, they probably have your phone number.
[15:23:01] <Khepra> they do, for my smart phone. that phone no is associated with a randomly generated <this>@gmail.com which I do not use for anything else. therefore I refuse to associate my phone number with client's domain.
[15:23:59] <Khepra> so yeah, googs has my phone but googs has no idea who I am, what I like, except through my movies selection and kindle library. wow, I'm a xenomorph, sci-fi, grimdark and wh40k fan! I can't stand being exposed like this!  /s  ;)
[15:24:13] <pj> I think you missed what I meant there.
[15:25:05] <Khepra> googs has _my_ phone, but googs has no association between me and the client's domain. if you meant something else, yeah, I'm missing the point :)
[15:26:39] <pj> I meant that google is just as likely, or more likely to have collected lots of personal info on you than the NSA.
[15:28:02] <Khepra> I am aware of that, and I'm being careful to separate my private data from public/work data. googs has no relations between me and the client.
[15:40:37] <Khepra> clck dot ru phishing campaigns from sendgrid and fake From header.   ho-ho-ho, merry xmass, and congratulations sendgrid, you just got promoted from spamscore 8 to full smtp ban.
[15:43:53] <Khepra> It's okay. our smtp ban messages direct them to our web based delisting form where they can explain the legitimacy. I can play the tonline game too.
