[01:16:45] <sudomann> Unsure which to choose
[01:17:00] <Dagmar> well, if you don't know anyting about ZFS, use LVM
[01:17:32] <Sauvin> Besides, I've heard zfs can be a memory hog.
[01:18:38] <Dagmar> For simple workstations, it'll just be "new for the sake of new" which does more harm than good

[01:19:18] <matsaman> no idea why they put it that way, though

[01:19:44] <matsaman> but Ubuntu is a weird place
[01:19:46] <Dagmar> matsaman: Mainly because the people in charge of Ubuntu are barely out of their teens
[01:19:53] <jim> sudomann, LVM gives you things like partitions, you can put whatever filesystem you want in them

[02:53:25] *** Joins: zoid (~zoid@user/taxationistheft)
[02:53:45] <themachine> well /dev is just a directory

[02:54:11] <retrosenator> yeah
[02:54:18] <akik> /dev is devtmpfs on my system
[02:54:22] <knocktwice> you could check available partitions with 'cat /proc/partitions'
[02:54:38] <knocktwice> I always do that before writing an SDCard or usb stick.
[02:54:43] <akoana> you can put the whole universe into /dev/....
[02:54:54] <akoana> /dev/null ;)
[02:54:56] <rascul> get your universe out of my /dev
[02:54:58] <akik> can you download the internet into /dev ?
[02:55:05] <retrosenator> it must have hiccupped and put the device on sdb once and this is what causes it

[07:35:11] <mlu> i.e. all three must be able to respond to rqeuests
[07:35:55] <Tabmow> depends, the servers can share an underlying filesystem. So technically you only have to 'copy' it once.

[15:49:22] <curdlesnoot> granted, it's a simplistic example as it disregards the exit status values. but, for most of what I do, it doesn't need to be any more complicated than that (though it could be).

[17:22:27] <peetaur> I think the problem is that it is a daemon instead o fjust a lib.... poettering style. Like why is dbus, pulse audio, etc. a daemon instead of just a lib that talks through a single daemon or the kernel? consuming RAM and leaving security holes open for no apparent reason.
[17:22:44] <peetaur> and firewalld
[17:23:26] <blackgatonegro> peetaur you can close a lot of holes by using right permissions, disabling services you don't use and having the right configuration.

[17:24:06] <peetaur> disable all you want and some stupid thing is still going to force you to run dbus
[17:24:21] <peetaur> you can find dbus ("desktop bus") running on a headless centos server for example

[21:11:25] <lacroix> [twisti]: since you want word splitting $VAR is correct, but is potentially risky since glob expansion will also be done.

[21:16:40] <curdlesnoot> [twisti]: if you're writing for bash - or indeed, any shell that supports arrays - and wish to stash arguments in variables, use them. for example, args=('foo bar' baz); foo "${args[@]}". in this case, exactly two arguments will be conveyed, correctly.

[21:18:58] <curdlesnoot> in any case, the fact that you didn't double quote the expansion in your initial example means that wort splitting occurs and, no, foo won't be given one argument.

[22:27:31] <lacroix> i mean that stderr is usually unbuffered but redirecting to a pipe generally causes it to become block buffered, and stdout is usually line buffered but directed to a file it becomes block buffered.  nothing standard can be done about it unless the program has a way to tell it to force the buffering mode for its fd's.
[22:27:40] *** Joins: zro (~zro@user/zro)
[22:28:00] <lacroix> some programs write directly to /dev/tty, bypassing the existing fd's.  the way to catch that output is to run it via a pty, though no standard program exists to do that there are 3rd party programs like unbuffer (part of expect).

[22:28:31] <koala_man> assuming the stream is "usually" a tty
[22:29:46] <Pickchea> Hey, I was wondering what happens under the hood if I shut down my machine with `systemctl poweroff`. I tried to look it up but whatever I find is either and explanation of how to shut down a Linux machine or something waaay too detailed for me. Specifically, I wonder how userspace programmes are dealt with. Are they all just killed with SIGKILL? Or do they get any chance to exit gracefully?
[22:29:59] * msiism pushes a TTY down mainstream.
[22:30:17] <neshpion> i would be surprised if they received SIGKILL

[22:31:57] <koala_man> Pickchea: services will be shut down gracefully, and remaining processes will be TERM'd and then KILL'd
[22:32:13] <lacroix> of course redirecting tee's stdout to stderr likely doesn't really matter.
[22:32:13] <lacroix> an fd connected to an interactive device (tty's are) results in stdout being line buffered and stderr being unbuffered -- by default, a program can change it if it likes.
[22:32:55] *** Joins: HumbleGuy (~HumbleGuy@89.149.84.108)

[22:34:44] <Pickchea> koala_man, ah, I thought so! But I also observe that `systemctl poweroff` is really quick even if I have many running processes left. I suppose it's in the programme's (or developer's) best interest to gracefully terminate as quickly as possible after receiving a SIGTERM because systemctl (or Linux, IDK) is pretty impatient and does not mess around.
