[01:34:27] <sartan> yeah with sasl and stuff there are layers, you can even make 'encrypted channels' or something, but at the end of the day someone there could just log it anyway.
[01:34:37] <sartan> I was thinking of something like Off The Record in channel-mode

[01:41:32] <sartan> so you get session level encryption, but anything you do or say can be used against you by simply logging it -- or on the other hand, remove the log entry/record where you said such a thing and deny you ever said it.  i just fail to see the point in encryption of irc channels
[01:41:37] <piou> sartan: it's all about threat model. The people you're protecting yourself from aren't necessarily the ones logging things on IRC. Sometimes you just don't want your employer reading what you write on IRC (or don't want them to be able to associate you to what you say on IRC) and don't care about the rest of the world.
[01:41:48] <sartan> non-repudation support for OTR when?

[01:42:20] <piou> Sure if the only threat model you consider is perfect secrecy then encrypted IRC doesn't make as much sense, but that's not the only valid threat model
[01:42:22] <sartan> i get what you're saying, but ssl is enough and can't provide anything else.
[01:42:52] <sartan> it's not possible to say whatever you blabber on about remains encrypted.
[01:43:12] <sartan> non-loggable IRC please =)

[01:44:30] <sartan> if someone is going to hold something you said against you, encryption isn't going to do shit, so why all the extra layers?
[01:44:37] <sartan> it's basically plaintext
[01:44:48] <piou> There again, you're only considering a very specific case
[01:44:50] <sartan> a tcpdump may not indicate what channels i join, but the sasl header may indicate my nick anyway.
[01:45:26] <piou> Many channels aren't public or public enough to get log bots
[01:45:47] <piou> I hear what you say for something like #security or #programming for example, but that's not all of IRC
[01:46:24] <topside> sartan, thats not what encrypted irc is protecting against

[01:47:48] <topside> no one is under the impression that it's providing secrecy

[01:48:16] <piou> topside: +1
[01:48:22] <sartan> iirc freenode had a bug with sasl code too that was exposing passwords from an exploited server
[01:48:32] <topside> it protects your login credentials, etc... its not made to protect you from posting something to an otherwise public forum and that not being indexed
[01:49:33] <piou> sartan: come on, bugs happen, they get fixed, life goes on... If there was a tendency as with openssl for example then maybe it's worth mentionning, but otherwise everything gets broken at some point or another
[01:49:52] <sartan> NICK <foo> is still plaintext on sasl
[01:49:59] <topside> so what?
[01:50:31] <sartan> now you're relying on chan +s/+p or any other metadata not available to someone who just wants to lurk on you or see where you're going.  Your identity is not protected with sasl
[01:50:48] <sartan> again it's not as useful or the panacea that you're all making it out to be
[01:50:53] *** Quits: zippy (~quassel@user/zippy) (Quit: https://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[01:50:58] <sartan> it's barely a convienence wrapper against plaintext nickserv auth, and nothing more
[01:51:04] <piou> who's making it look like a panacea?
[01:51:52] <piou> All I'm saying is that your threat model doesn't encompass the cases where it's useful, so of course it's not useful for the cases you consider. But a panacea? Of course not.
[01:51:54] <sartan> private key authentication would be a much nicer alternative.

[01:53:50] <sartan> you can't provide a certificate in replacement of plaintext nick
[01:54:03] <synaps3> why is gpg so tied to email
[01:54:35] <MadCamel> the protocol's plaintext. certfp authenticates your nickname to the network services which attest to your identity. At least one layer of your identity. OTR keys are the other layer.

[04:54:40] <wilsonfisk> forgetting the fact that the state almost surely has more relevant targets to worry about; if (and this is a gigantic IF) some shadow state-sponsored entity wants something from you, they're going to get it. They have waaaaaaaaaay more resources, many many more assets looking for/at you, and waaaaaaaaaay more legal resources than you could possibly acquire.

[05:22:02] <wilsonfisk> even if you were 'full caveman' do you realize how often you're on camera on a daily basis?
[05:22:02] <vyrus-home2> he got caught scavenging food : /
[05:22:12] <wilsonfisk> tens of times
[05:22:18] <vyrus-home2> lol badass
[05:22:39] <vyrus-home2> btw its almost impossible to survive a maine winter without a fire, which he did the whole time.
[05:23:17] <catties> if i ever did i assume i'd need to start raising/growning my own chickens/veggies to avoid the need for stealing food... i certainly wouldn't do it in maine tho, too cold.

[09:22:09] <victorb> Hey everyone.
[09:22:09] <victorb> So I am working on a presentation for my class about online tracking.
[09:22:10] <victorb> I do have some a good amount of technical knowledge about online tracking, but I would like to show some examples/demonstration about online tracking, maybe even something my colleagues can try on their own computers? Do you guys have any ideas, it would be much appreciated!
[09:22:10] <victorb> Some classic examples I can think of my self is the Google timeline, that shows Google knows where you are 24/7, getting tracked by just clicking on a link (grabify
[09:22:10] <victorb> My goal is that they learn something that they might can use after the class, or maybe think more about online tracking in the future.
[09:22:10] <victorb> Thanks in advance for the help :)

[11:49:04] <ash_worksi> can anyone help me with oauth?
[11:50:15] <piou> ash_worksi: it's always better to just ask your actual question rather than first seeking a specific volunteer as no one can know whether they can help you with your issue at the moment
[11:51:00] *** Quits: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[11:51:18] <ash_worksi> piou: yeah, I've been probing with an actual question for awhile though :|
[11:51:46] <ash_worksi> anyway, I have a legacy app, we're trying to integrate oauth to allow some functionality through cloudflare
[11:52:04] <ash_worksi> which means I have to abstract some logic out of the existing monolith into an API
[11:52:17] <ash_worksi> both that and the auth will be in containers
[11:52:47] *** Quits: vaio (~gary@user/ghost) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:52:52] <ash_worksi> the flow for cloudflare specifically is pretty straghtforward, they'll use a code grant
[11:53:13] *** Joins: vaio (~gary@user/ghost)
[11:53:55] <ash_worksi> but my concern is the existing monolith, I have to port existing users to the auth db, and existing users need to be able to login through the existing site, as well as new users register, but have their credentials saved to the auth db

[11:57:36] <ash_worksi> the options, as I see them is to (1) create REST endpoints on the auth server and allow connections to those endpoints from the host machine without authentication or (2) use whatever this is (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-prompt-create-1_0.html) to register new users still using the auth-code flow

[23:09:50] <Arsen> also, wouldn't oauth only be tasked with authenticating external programs and services with github, rather than users themselves
[23:10:05] <ash_worksi> yes, BUT, this is what didn't make sense to me...

[23:10:20] <ash_worksi> you have to login with the same creds regardless if you use oauth or not
[23:10:38] <Arsen> well, yes, you authenticate, and only after that you go through the oauth flow to authorize the program
[23:10:38] <ash_worksi> so either the frontend for github needs to query the same service that works for oauth
[23:10:50] <ash_worksi> or the frontend is rendering a form from that service

[23:16:29] <ash_worksi> the auth service would have its own database it would use for authentication, right? I can see how oauth works for 3rd party apps, and even apps you deploy as like a SPA or mobile app

[23:17:43] <makersmasher> ash_worksi, do you want to setup oath and local authentication?
[23:17:46] <ash_worksi> but for a webservice in that environment, you don't really need to use a code grant right? I would imagine it would be a client credentials grant

[23:43:23] <Arsen> right, so you want to create a usual auth flow and an oauth flow
[23:43:33] <Arsen> I can't really say much about the latter, it's been years since I've done oauth2

[23:45:50] <Arsen> both, by the sound of it
[23:48:25] <ash_worksi> ShiftyLogic: I am basically in the same position as github; I manage users, provide a service and need to allow other apps to interact with services on the behalf of authroizing users

[23:49:50] <ShiftyLogic> OAuth2 protocols are pretty prescriptive about this.

[23:51:55] <ash_worksi> in fact, I understand it at a fairly nuts and bolts level

[23:52:30] *** Quits: laurell8221 (~laurell@user/laurell) (Quit: Bon voyage!)
[23:52:41] <ash_worksi> but when you're responsible for authenticating your own users from your own frontend, then I am not sure what route to go...
[23:53:16] <ash_worksi> in other words, I don't think you'd treat a server-side rendered application (like github) the same way you'd treat a 3rd party
[23:53:40] <ash_worksi> you could use a client credentials grant, but things get a bit muddy for me when I think about registering users
[23:53:51] <ShiftyLogic> That's not true. You do treat your own services as the same. They still have to validate whatever signed token you have for authorization
[23:54:24] <ShiftyLogic> If the auth service is completely decoupled... your own backend is nothing more than another 3rd party.
[23:54:26] <ash_worksi> well, if you have like mTLS between your services, then maybe that's not necessary?
[23:54:26] *** Joins: laurell8221 (~laurell@user/laurell)
[23:54:49] <ShiftyLogic> The only difference is that it is probably "pre-authorized" instead of needing to be registered as a 3rd party app.
