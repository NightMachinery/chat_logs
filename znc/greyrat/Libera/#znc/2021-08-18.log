[23:30:14] <DoctorD90> yeah....I had in plan to do it since lasst august :D my vacation are quite ended so I decided to focus a bit on it :)
[23:30:53] <MetaNova> it's nice when you finally get around to a project
[23:31:02] <DoctorD90> yeah! 
[23:31:07] <MetaNova> I'm glad you're finding satisfaction from it :)
[23:31:28] <DoctorD90> I had just a question. Is it correct for the ZNC to append the DH params at the end of znc.pem?
[23:32:25] <DoctorD90> and moreover, in case of split, what do you think about to introduce a new line for the CA certificates? I mean something like SSLCAFile = /path/to/combined/cert.pem
[23:32:34] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@bcdcb6e3.skybroadband.com)
[23:32:46] <DoctorD90> I find satisfaction thinking that my contribute is useful (with 1 L :D ahahah)
[23:35:27] <MetaNova> I am not an expert, but, from the wording of https://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate "You should also generate the Diffie–Hellman key exchange parameters, also appended to znc.pem" it seems this is a recommended but not technically required step
[23:36:33] <MetaNova> since I use certbot and LetsEncrypt on the one host where I have signed SSL certificates, I do not see where the DH params come into play, since all three SSL* variables all point to znc.pem which, last I looked at it, does not contain DH params
[23:36:41] <MetaNova> leading me to conclude that this is optional
[23:36:54] <DoctorD90> yeah...I based on that one. I did a copy paste form same pages from which I will put the redirect as last update step
[23:37:00] <MetaNova> if it is optional, then, I'm also unclear as to the advantages of it
[23:37:09] <MetaNova> or what inclusion of the DH params is supposed to offer
[23:38:14] <DoctorD90> DH comes in hand if setuped otherwise the connection dont use them (I dont think there are DHparams hard coded as default). Their "retriving" should be checked probably in the source code but C is out of my knowledge
[23:38:47] <DoctorD90> (and thanks! You are telling me a good point: what are DH for...I will add it)
[23:38:59] <MetaNova> DoctorD90: we would need to wait for someone who is more knowledgeable about SSL/TLS and encryption in general to speak about if the DH params are actually optional and what advantage(s) their inclusion offers
[23:39:25] <MetaNova> ah. it seems you do know a bit more about them
[23:40:52] <DoctorD90> yeah, I was just wondering how to feed them to ZNC :)
[23:41:17] <MetaNova> it seems unambiguous that IF you include the DH params that they be the very last thing appended to the znc.pem file
[23:41:52] <MetaNova> or you just point to them specifically with SSLDHParamFile = /path/to/DH/file.pem
[23:41:52] <DoctorD90> yes

[23:42:33] <DoctorD90> but I wa wondering for znc.pem ingle version
[23:43:01] <DoctorD90> well..dinner ready....see u later!
[23:43:05] <MetaNova> if you are using the concatenated znc.pem strategy the DH params seem optional but if you do include them, include them last
