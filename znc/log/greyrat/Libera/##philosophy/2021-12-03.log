[00:54:50] <Franciman> hi all
[00:55:09] <Franciman> when they speak about pre-thoretical concepts
[00:55:13] <Franciman> what is usually meant?
[00:57:12] <goli> thoretical or theoretical?
[00:58:07] <Franciman> eheh sorry, typo
[00:58:10] <Franciman> theoretical, indeed
[00:58:14] <goli> okay
[00:58:19] <goli> what do you think?
[00:58:29] <goli> its a new question to me
[00:58:45] <Franciman> my vague idea is that you are speaking to something that is common knowledge
[00:58:52] <Franciman> but has not been philosophically investigated with rigour
[00:58:54] <goli> tho am a man of wisdom so i can explain the words as they are
[00:59:10] <Franciman> but it does not make much sense
[00:59:10] <goli> okay i see
[00:59:14] <Franciman> maybe it just means
[00:59:18] <Franciman> assumptions of the theory
[00:59:28] <Franciman> it surely is something that comes before my theory
[00:59:30] <Franciman> :P
[00:59:44] <goli> well
[00:59:50] <goli> life is a mystery
[01:00:05] <goli> many things we in the experience can't explain

[01:00:29] <goli> somethings are sent from above
[01:00:36] <goli> or the beyond
[01:01:02] <goli> that's how i see pre theory
[01:01:14] <goli> theory is what has been put together
[01:01:28] <goli> an explanation of an already existing concept
[01:01:39] <goli> like the theory of gravity
[01:02:04] <I_Am_M00t> life is a mystery
[01:02:09] <I_Am_M00t> everyone must stand alone
[01:02:15] <goli> the pre-theory of gravity would be gravity itself
[01:02:54] <Franciman> so it's like what makes me want to get a theory
[01:02:55] <goli> the thing that was already there for the observation to occur
[01:02:57] <Franciman> lol
[01:03:48] <Franciman> thanks

[02:23:16] <causative> evil goes with lies simply because if evil were honest, it would be seen for what it is and dismantled

[03:24:01] <causative> blame and anger are only meaningful when they are useful, i.e. when blaming someone or punishing them is a good way to reduce the undesired behavior
[03:24:51] <causative> if the undesired behavior resulted from lack of knowledge, then granting that knowledge is the right way to correct the behavior
[03:25:22] <causative> if the undesired behavior resulted from something they can't change, e.g. a disability, then getting mad will achieve nothing and change nothing

[03:29:17] <causative> impartial reason and compassion makes more sense when these conditions are not met
[03:30:51] <causative> also, of course, an angry response is only good when the person being angry is truly in the right

[21:53:53] <causative> Delf, each person has the burden of judging for themselves what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false
[21:54:13] <causative> they may rely on the judgments of others - but the decision to rely on the judgments of others is also a judgment itself
[21:54:22] <causative> ultimately the burden is theirs alone
[21:59:23] <darklambda> anthony burden himself when judging food perhaps
[22:03:46] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@34.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[22:05:02] <Delf> causative: Damn right
[22:07:37] <Delf> Some judge it to be right, to put others at disadvantage and use their lack of understanding against them. What is right/wrong, true/false is not the same as legitimate and not, not when you consider structures of authority.
[22:07:52] <causative> but we should not take from this that truth or morality is relative
[22:08:08] <causative> our judgment of it is always up to the individual, but the individual can still be right or wrong
[22:08:35] <Delf> Can they be right or wrong without any judgment?
[22:08:48] <causative> whether they are right or wrong does not depend on what other people think
[22:08:53] <causative> it's a question of the actual state of affairs in the world
[22:09:26] <Delf> So they're right/wrong according to what?
[22:09:40] <causative> according to the world
[22:10:05] <Delf> The world!?
[22:10:18] <causative> if you think a tree fell, but it did not fall, then you were wrong regardless of how many people agree with you
[22:10:52] <causative> the tree itself is what makes you wrong, not other people
[22:10:59] <Delf> Ok, not the actual planet but rather the environment, whatever it may be
[22:11:17] <darklambda> someone can always twist it to make it right.. like figuratively, etc... :-)
[22:11:41] <Delf> That's politics, another subject!
[22:11:47] <darklambda> lol
[22:13:03] <Delf> That f***ing tree makes me in the wrong, what have I ever done to wrong that tree.

[22:19:46] <arryana> that reminds me of a thing, have you seen 'after the dark'
[22:19:46] <arryana> ?
[22:20:33] <arryana> sociologically fascinating film, involving philosophy students
[22:22:56] <Delf> causative: It's me making the thinking that it fell that does myself wrong, not the tree. The tree is innocent
[22:22:58] <darklambda> i haven't yet.. but thanks for mentioning.. will try to cehck out
[22:23:15] <causative> it's the combination of the two, Delf
[22:23:20] <causative> the state of affairs and what you think about it
[22:23:27] <arryana> it has issues, it isn't a perfect film.  but it's a great spotlight on why philosophers aren't always the best suited to make decisions.
[22:23:31] <darklambda> the tree wants you to think that :-P
[22:23:37] <darklambda> :-D
[22:23:48] <Delf> causative: So the tree being innocent and my lack of accuracy in what I think? I thought only the latter was it, not the former.
[22:24:14] <causative> "accuracy" is a relationship between what you think and what is real
[22:24:18] <causative> it involves both
[22:24:41] <darklambda> what is real? :-)
[22:25:00] <Delf> But I must realize that I was in the wrong, otherwise I'll think I'm right
[22:25:22] <Delf> And that's something I rather not do
[22:25:57] <Delf> The tree will not tell me that I'm wrong, only I can notice it (if I'm unlucky)
[22:26:00] <causative> you may think you're right and not be right
[22:26:31] <Delf> By that proposition I'm always wrong, no matter what as accuracy will always be short... since there can always be more accuracy
[22:26:56] <Delf> Unless I develop rules... that intentionally limit the accuracy as a consequence
[22:27:13] <causative> well, that's a different subject, and yes, you're almost always slightly inaccurate, accuracy is usually not a binary thing
[22:27:19] <causative> you can be mostly right and slightly wrong
[22:27:33] <causative> and you can also *think* you're mostly right, but be mostly wrong
[22:27:34] <Delf> So.. less wrong is the ideal, totally right
[22:27:48] <arryana> tough question.  i'm not sure there's an easy answer for 'what is real'
[22:27:53] <Delf> s/totally/not totally/
[22:27:53] <ro-bot-o> Delf meant to say: So.. less wrong is the ideal, not totally right
[22:27:56] <darklambda> less wrong.. there's an irc channel for that :-)
