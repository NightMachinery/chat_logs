[00:32:47] <blahboybaz> Since there's only about a dozen commits so far I tried a  $ git grep jest $(git rev-list --all)  and just was scrolling through it till I found what I needed. I think I need to write better commit messages :p
[00:33:28] <blahboybaz> canton7: I'm the only one to blame (there isn't anyone else working on the repo than me)
[00:33:50] <canton7> blahboybaz, 'git blame' will take every line in a file, and show you which commits introduced that line
[00:34:18] <blahboybaz> Oh, that's cool. I didn't know that.
[00:34:43] <canton7> (the command-line version is slightly clunky to use, but 'git gui blame' is nice and easy to use)

[01:34:32] <nesmysl> what is the rationale for prohibiting git clone --bare --origin=myname?  does anyone know?
[01:35:05] <ikke> cannot think of an obvious reason
[01:35:31] *** Quits: adamts (~Adam@user/mysteryblokhed) (Client Quit)
[01:36:22] <osse> the ref spec will map refs/heads to refs/heads so the name of origin won't appear anywhere
[01:36:24] <osse> (I think)
[01:37:05] <ikke> But that should not prevent the name of the remote being changed, does it?
[01:37:47] <osse> what remote?
[01:37:52] <osse> ;)
[01:37:56] <nesmysl> i have a bare clone of git/git.git which has [remote "origin"]\n\turl = git@github.com:git/git.git in config, so it's still appearing there.
[01:38:23] <ikke> osse: a bare repository can have remotes
[01:38:37] <osse> i know
[01:38:39] *** Joins: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)
[01:38:49] <osse> but the description of --bare makes it sound like git clone --bare won't set one up
[01:38:54] <nesmysl> created today with 2.32.0 without any other options.

[01:39:53] <nesmysl> also, the ref (non)munging should be a separate option imo.
[01:41:50] <osse> ikke: nvm me. silly me.
[01:41:52] <osse> I fully agree
[01:42:26] <nesmysl> i just wanted a --bare that would be just that.  --no-checkout bitches about non-empty dirs, --bare cripples refs.  wth.
[01:46:26] <osse> it's easy enough to rename it afterwards
[01:46:41] <osse> but I removed the combination check from the code and everything seems to work fine anyway
[01:46:54] <osse> so maybe the check is no longer needed
[01:47:43] <ikke> osse: does git blame on that code reveal something?
[01:50:40] <osse> ikke: it's been like that since clone was first built in in 2008
[01:51:01] <osse> nesmysl: long hanging fruits here. do you want to submit a patch? :-) If not I will do it
[01:51:08] <osse> *low hanging

[07:13:32] <bremner> I don't think this is a situation where "self contained compilable example" applies.
[07:14:07] <blahboybaz> Why doesn't git allow me to keep  .gitignore  under repository management? I thought I remembered this working before but now it does not recognize the file being there
[07:14:24] <bremner> blahboybaz: it should work fine. many people do that.
[07:14:47] <bremner> perhaps you are ignoring .gitignore?

[07:17:08] <blahboybaz> bremner: I had  .gitignore  in my .gitignore and had done work in the repository then I decided I should probably track it so I removed the .gitignore entry in the .gitignore file but it is not being picked up by git at all
[07:17:53] <bremner> blahboybaz: you can try "git status --ignored"
[07:17:58] <blahboybaz> I do have a  ~/.gitignore_global  existing but it is empty. The .gitignore I'm trying to include in the repository is local to the repository
[07:18:07] <blahboybaz> hmm
[07:18:10] <shlomif> bremner: i haven't worked w cgit a lot
[07:18:50] <blahboybaz> bremner: Yeah, it shows the .gitignore that I want to track listed in there

[07:37:46] <blahboybaz> I didn't catch that in the man page (my bad)
[07:39:44] <mackerman> I remember that not from the man page but from someone else on this channel examining a gitignore a while back.
[07:40:12] <blahboybaz> mackerman: Yeah, the output of that command is telling me that the line I already deleted is the cause. The file is saved and it no longer contains the line that  $ git check-ignore --verbose  is blaming for it being ignored.

[08:08:18] <blahboybaz> git is talking about some really freaky shit and I'm concerned abotu messing up and losing work. I was working in a branch off master where I made commits (locally) then I had one file I wanted to commit to master so I switched to master and committed it. Now, back on the branch I was working on, I saw a message something about my branch diverging but talking about commits that are on both master and the
[08:08:24] <blahboybaz> branch I'm on. It suggested doing a  $ git pull  but when I run that command it appears like I will be making a commit locally that is comming in from the remote (in other words like my local environment will be made to match the remote). Before all this happened the remote was behind local (I had unpushed changes locally - lot of work too). Could I lose work I did locally if I complete a  $ git pull ?

[16:43:33] <ebeip90> Hello all!  I think that there's not a way to do what I want to do with Git, but I thought it was worth asking here.  I have several commits -- let's call them A, B, and C.  They are not linear, and may be entirely unrelated (i.e. no path from A..B or B..C).  I would like to, with a single "git log -p" statement, show the changes introduced by A, B, and C.  However, "git log -p -1 A B C" will only show one commit.  "git log -p -3 A B C" will sho
[16:43:33] <ebeip90> w A and two of its ancestors.  It seems that in order to get what I want, I need to invoke "git log -p -1 A" then "git log -p -1 B" in order to get the diff of each.  As an added request, it would be nice to see the CUMULATIVE diff of A, B, C -- though it seems the only way to do this is to create a new branch (at whatever commit git-merge-base tells me) and cherry-pick each commit -- which may not work.  Any ideas on how I can make this work?
[16:44:10] <osse> ebeip90: git log -p --no-walk A B C
[16:44:14] <osse> ebeip90: or git show A B C
[16:44:55] <osse> a cumulative diff is not possible unless you do soemthing akin to what you describe (ie. make them in sequence somehow)

[16:56:34] <ebeip90> While I have your attention, some of what I'm doing is identifying commits which are related to a given problem ID (not JIRA, but think JIRA).  I generally identify these with "git log --grep 123456 --pretty=%h".  I then post-process these to identify merge commits -- git cat-file -p somehash -- and make the assumption that the second "parent" line is the branch which was merged into the mainline (which is the first "parent" line).  Is this a re
[16:56:34] <ebeip90> asonable assumption, or is the parent ordering dependent on the ordering of the arguments provided to "git merge"?  It seems that e.g. BitBucket / GitHub / GitLab all follow this pattern for merges, but I wasn't sure if that was convention or by coincidence.  The reason that I'm doing this is that it's not uncommon for the individual commits for a fix to not mention the Issue ID#, and it may only be on ONE of the commits on the branch, or on the
[16:56:34] <ebeip90>  actual merge commit itself.  It seems that I can take advantage of the 99% case, but I wasn't sure if there's anything in Git's internals that orders the "parent" lines in "git cat-file -p hash".
[16:57:50] <Timvde> ebeip90: yes, the order is dependent on the current branch/arguments provided to `git merge`
[16:58:07] <osse> The parents of a merge are ordered. when you're in master and do 'git merge feature' then the current commit (HEAD before the merge) becomes the first parent and the branch you merge in becomes the second parent
[16:58:39] <osse> ebeip90: so I'd expect the result of accepting a merge/pull request is that the feature/bugfix branch is 99 % of the time the second parent
[16:59:21] <osse> ebeip90: git log --merges will filter the log down to just merged. and you can include the parents in the format with %p
[16:59:24] <Timvde> I'd say that every reasonable interface would do it like that, the other way around doesn't make sense to me
[16:59:41] <ebeip90> Timvde / osse: Thanks for clarifying.  It seems that I'm taking advantage of convention, but that convention will generally hold except for unsual cases where somebody does 'git checkout feature-branch; git merge main; git push origin main'
[17:00:05] <osse> ebeip90: yes, and if the PR then results in a fast-forward
[17:00:38] <osse> if accepting the PR *always* creates a merge (ie. merge --no--ff; I believe this is default on github) then there's a merge in 100 % of the cases
[17:03:29] <osse> ebeip90: actually you don't really need the parent hashes. for the merge X you can do git log X^1..X^2 to view what was done in that branch
[17:03:53] <ebeip90> I do occasionally need to deal with changes that are rebased instead of merged, but those cases also won't contain any merge-commits, so the steps I'm taking should still work.  Hundreds of teams all do stuff their own way, across BitBucket, GitHub Enterprise, and Gerrit (and I'm sure somebody has a GitLab instance somewhere) -- just trying to nail down the 99% so that the documentation I write for "wtf is this doing" can be accurate.

It seems unusual to me that a *.cpp file does not use the 'cpp' userdiff regexes by deafult, and that making some opinionated defaults would make the --show-function and --function-context flags more accurate out-of-the-box.

[17:31:39] *** Quits: andika (~andika@116.206.42.84) (Client Quit)
[17:34:31] <osse> Gurkenglas: firstly, you'll have to consult github docs on how to find all forks of a repo.
[17:34:42] <mackerman> Gurkenglas: That is a question for #github.  Git does not know about other repos, unless they already are remotes.
[17:35:15] <osse> secondly, git itself has no proper concept of where a branch starts. a branch just labels the tip of a line of history and goes all the way back to the beginning. So the useless but technically correct answer is all of them
[17:35:22] <Gurkenglas> ah, so i'd start by somehow adding all forks as remotes
[17:36:12] <Gurkenglas> osse, but doesnt git draw graphs that show branching-off points?
[17:36:31] <osse> yes
[17:36:55] <Gurkenglas> i suppose a better way to phrase it is to show all commits in any branch in any remote that touch a given folder
[17:37:16] <Gurkenglas> sounding more and more like an sql query
[17:37:33] <osse> ah. assuming you've added all forks as remotes:  git log --all -- given/folder
[17:37:48] <Gurkenglas> thanks!
[17:39:09] <osse> finding a branching-off point isn't that hard. can be done with git merge-base
[17:39:32] <osse> something like:  git log $(git merge-base master somebranch)..somebranch -- given/folder
[17:40:13] <osse> but there can be several such points, and if somebranch has been merged to master but also been worked on later gets a bit more difficult

[17:44:58] <osse> not sure about the ordering part, but the rest can be done first by collecting all the commits via the previous command, then using git branch --contains=X for all of them
