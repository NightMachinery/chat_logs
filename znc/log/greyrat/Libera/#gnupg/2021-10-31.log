[00:00:40] <yang> I'll get one of those 
[00:00:57] <duxsco> i don't know what you mean by "USB key+private key sign". nitrokey allows for your private key to be store on the usb stick. i personally prefer using a normal smartcard with a read that has a pinpad included.
[00:01:07] <duxsco> s/store/stored/
[00:01:17] <duxsco> s/sread/reader/
[00:01:25] <duxsco> i meant s/read/reader/
[00:03:45] <yang> yes, I use that method currently
[00:03:51] <yang> but
[00:03:58] <yang> you need a pinpad etc.
[00:04:06] <yang> it's complicated when you travel
[00:04:11] <yang> I mean I have a big pinpad
[00:05:59] <yang> its fine for home use I guess
[00:06:51] <duxsco> there are readers that are small enough to fit in trouser pockets
[00:08:26] <duxsco> i use a cyberjack rfid standard, which is not the smallest one, but has real buttons which is helpful for blindly typing in the pin
[00:09:33] <duxsco> the cyberjack go plus is smaller (heightxwidthxdepth = 87 x 68 x 10 mm), but only has a touchpad. thus, you need to look where you type.
[00:10:39] <duxsco> i also got me a PopSockets to better hold the reader
[00:14:11] <yang> ok nice
[00:14:53] <duxsco> ccid driver supported readers: https://ccid.apdu.fr/ccid/supported.html
[00:16:44] <duxsco> and, reiner-sct readers have their own drivers: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/cyberjack

[00:31:41] <yang> Yeah, I looked at Conrad store and it's 80 eur
[00:31:55] <yang> What about the Smartcards, are those obtainable anywhere?
[00:32:06] <yang> the credit card sized smartcards?
[00:36:42] <henk> https://www.floss-shop.de/de/security-privacy/smartcards/ is about the only shop I know that sells them
[00:36:55] <duxsco> i got this one https://www.smartcardfocus.com/shop/ilp/id~879/nxp-j3h145-dual-interface-java-card-144k/p/index.shtml

[00:37:54] <duxsco> i feel better doing the compiling/flashing myself. and, it's cheaper...
[00:38:51] <duxsco> but, keep in mind the limitations: https://github.com/duxsco/gpg-smartcard#create-a-gnupg-keypair

[00:49:07] <yang> I cannot look up which one I have right now, because I don't have the reader nearby
[00:49:27] <duxsco> henk, your smartcard only supports rsa (afaik)
[00:50:08] <yang> duxsco: what is the benefit/difference of having cyberjack rfid standard Vs. nitrokey 3A USB key?
[00:50:14] <duxsco> i personally use ed25519 for the primary key, nistp521 for encryption/signing subkeys and nistp384 for authentication subkey
[00:51:36] <duxsco> yang, the nistrokey doesn't have a pinpad
[00:51:55] <yang> so pinpad is one layer more secure, because you type in pin ?
[00:51:58] <duxsco> but, the newest nitrokey generation supports ed25519 which is a big plus
[00:52:28] <henk> yang: yeah, mine is green too, but not signed by RMS :D
[00:52:40] <yang> henk: hehe
[00:52:43] <henk> duxsco: yeah, AFAIK that‚Äôs correct
[00:53:37] <duxsco> yang, dunno whether that's more secure, but i just need to remember the pin (6 digits) and admin pin (8 digits). dunno how that's for the nitrokey
[00:53:41] <henk> btw: I have a cherry smartterminal here. works fine and is kinda heavy. does not have a display.
[00:54:12] <henk> duxsco: does your display work? or maybe better: is it useful with gpg?
[00:54:15] <yang> I think I have something similar to henk...bulky device the size of a computer mouse.
[00:54:23] <yang> with pinpad
[00:54:26] <duxsco> henk, yes it works

[00:55:05] <henk> the cherry terminal works with ccid, which is a bit less of a hassle than pcscd. or at least was when I first started playing around with cards ‚Ä¶
[00:55:06] *** Quits: Iamthehuman (~noname@user/iamthehuman) (Client Quit)
[00:55:24] <duxsco> it shows "pin:" if you need to type in the pin. and, notifies you that you need to pull the smartcard out and push it in again if the smartcard cannot be read
[00:55:27] <henk> yang: yeah, I‚Äôd say bigger than most computer mice ‚Ä¶
[00:55:46] <henk> duxsco: oh, cool. but I‚Äôm guessing it needs pcscd, right?
[00:56:13] <duxsco> henk, dunno. i have pcscd running by default.
[00:56:20] <yang> henk: quite an extra baggage when travelling and all the wires I think mine goes from PS/2 to USB somehow...the nitrokey would be much smaller
[00:57:09] <duxsco> henk, i had to disable ccid due to a bug on gnupg 2.3: https://github.com/duxsco/gpg-config-and-scripts/commit/774c4be4b03b8da60ca084a5c60467ecd6caba2a#diff-ec1a7c030388c47b663a52579f4f9bd61309c9ea6f9daae8c49f254d004ca657R6
[00:58:48] <henk> duxsco: oh, so it was no(t much) hassle to set the reader up with pcscd?
[00:59:59] <henk> yang: yeah, it is /-: and it‚Äôs probably overkill and very barely needed to be able to use the card on any computer, even a non-trusted one ‚Ä¶ for daily use with your own computer a nitrokey is probably just fine.
[01:00:56] <duxsco> henk, i didn't have any problems with pcscd. just now, i turned off pcscd and i could use the smartcard anymore... 
[01:01:59] <duxsco> wait a minute. i had the wrong card in there...
[01:03:31] <duxsco> nope, my reader requires pcscd
[01:04:54] <duxsco> for work, private stuff and public stuff (e.g. github) i have a card with their own keypair each
[01:04:56] <yang> hm, how do you check if its ccid or pcsd, if you dont have the reaser nearby ?
[01:05:04] <yang> s/reaser/reader
[01:05:46] <yang> asking for myself
[01:07:04] <duxsco> yang, ccid is the driver and pcsc-lite is "PC/SC Architecture smartcard middleware library" (got that from the description of my distro's package)
[01:07:56] <duxsco> if it's not a reiner-sct device which usually use their cyberjack driver you most likely use ccid driver
[01:09:18] <duxsco> so, there is cyberjack, ccid (https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/CCID) and ccid in-stock driver (https://wiki.debian.org/GnuPG/CCID_Driver)
[01:09:59] <duxsco> my setup is working fine on linux. but, i need to get the reader working on macos...
[01:10:33] <duxsco> on macos, it doesn't recognise the reader's pinpad 
[01:10:46] <duxsco> s/it/gnupg/
[01:11:26] <duxsco> there is one reiner-sct supported by ccid though: https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/CCID/search?q=reiner-sct
[01:12:31] <duxsco> ... but that one is a brick
[01:17:25] <yang> Yes, I used the one from Ludovic

[13:07:55] <xdbob> Hey, I'm trying tu use a smartcard via `pcsc` instead of `ccid`. My PIN code is not cached anymore, is it known/expected ? Can I do something about it ?
[13:12:06] <duxsco> ccid is the driver, pcsc is a library for accessing smartcards 
[13:12:34] <duxsco> drivers: so, there is cyberjack, ccid (https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/CCID) and ccid in-stock driver (https://wiki.debian.org/GnuPG/CCID_Driver)
[13:13:05] <duxsco> i, for example, use the "cyberjack" driver. my reader, however, won't work if i have pcscd service turned off
[13:13:26] <duxsco> i use a reiner-sct cyberjack rfid standard
[13:23:36] <xdbob> fedora 35 ships a gpg with the `--disable-ccid-driver` configure option, so I guess before my scdaemon was directly interfacing with the smartcard, now it's interfacing with `pcscd`
[13:24:41] <duxsco> xdbob, dunno whether that flag just affects in-stock gnupg ccid drivers: https://wiki.debian.org/GnuPG/CCID_Driver
[13:24:58] <duxsco> and not those provided by ccid (https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/CCID)
[13:25:17] <duxsco> afaik, pcscd doesn't replace the driver
[13:30:23] <duxsco> xdbob, i think i am writing rubbish. perhaps, you can live without pcsc
[13:32:21] <duxsco> i tested with an kobil kt kaan advanced that uses the ccid driver. turning off pcscd make the reader not work anymore
[13:32:35] <duxsco> so, for me both pcscd and ccid are required
