[01:24:40] <plaisthos> rob0: deep packet inspection
[01:24:45] <plaisthos> and the answer is no
[01:24:56] <plaisthos> it can certainly detect that traffic is OpenVPN
[01:43:13] <ikwyl6> rob0: thanks for helpful info. That is what I was looking for. So what comms are done on tun0 to the vpn server? Is that for the initial syn and initial connectiion and the encrypted communication is done ssl connection via the physical int? 
[02:03:35] <BtbN> It's the tunnel to the VPN server.
[02:04:01] <BtbN> Not sure what you're confused about, but the tun interface is quite literally the tunnel itself.
[02:04:13] <BtbN> You can't just flick a switch and eth0 goves via a VPN.
[02:04:18] <BtbN> eth0 is and stays eth0
[02:27:22] <ikwyl6> BtbN: I'm sorry that I'm not being clear. I'm just wondering what types of communication are done over the tun0 interfce and what is done over the eth0 interface. I have my vpn IP that I use for openvpn to connect to and once connected I get a IP that seems to do all the transferring of data. Is this correct? 
[02:28:11] <BtbN> All communication over the tunnel goes over the tun interface
[02:28:16] <BtbN> It has to go somewhere, after all

[02:54:47] <ikwyl6> ok that's not what's happening with me then. I see some hostnames and traffic over my tun0 but on eth0 there is a lot of packets going between eth0 and the remote VPN IP which I assume is all the data between the initial connection that is done on tun0. My assumption is that all data is done over the tun0 interface but this isn't the case.. I just want to make sure I'm not leaking any data.. 
[03:01:39] <BtbN> How do you think openvpn talks to the server? Of course the trafic needs to go out of your network card.
[03:02:00] <BtbN> It just re-packages what goes into your tunnel, and sends it to the other end of the VPN
[03:07:09] <rob0> The packets you send and receive via the tunnel are what are sent and received in the tun interface.
[03:07:28] <rob0> so that depends on the user[s]
[03:07:55] <rob0> you have an IP address on tun0
[03:08:43] <rob0> if someone elsewhere on the VPN tries to connect to your tun0 address, their packets go through the VPN to you.

[03:11:23] <rob0> you might need to talk to your VPN administrator about your concerns
[03:14:26] <rob0> if you are the admin, see --redirect-gateway and --push in the manual, https://build.openvpn.net/man/openvpn-2.5/openvpn.8.html
[03:14:50] <rob0> (search using the "--" to find the item you need)
[03:14:58] <BtbN> I feel like there's a much deeper misunderstanding than just routing.

[06:40:48] <ikwyl6> There is a gateway IP that my tun0 is conencted to and when openvpn runs with the config file from my vpn provider, it creates the tun0 interface and adds a route using my eth0 interface using a different IP. I would assume all my traffic would go through the gw on tun0  but most of it goes to the IP on the eth0 interface. Maybe this is just the way it is supposed to be but I thought all traffic
[06:40:50] <ikwyl6> would go through the gw on tun0. Sorry for beating a horse. thank you.

[08:25:39] <Poster> You're likely seeing a host route using eth0 to reach your VPN Provider server address, from there you'll usually get a route to 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 via tun0 which will then get all default (Internet) traffic
[08:25:57] <Poster> the traffic you are seeing on eth0 is the VPN client to the VPN server

[23:27:32] <ke4nhw> My brain literally physically hurts. wow.
[23:29:19] <ke4nhw> Okay, As for the server, I am running OpenVPN on Centos 7. Works fine. I tried downloading OpenVPN Connect client to a Windows 10 laptop, and found that there's not even a way to get my keys and config file into the program. I uninstalled it. I installed an older client, 2.4.1-I601, and it's a wierd case. <cont>
[23:31:06] <ke4nhw> I imported my config file and keys into the config directory, and found that the OpenVPN Service or Legacy Service either one failed, no connection, no idea why. I then disabled and stopped them (I tried them one at a time of course) and tried the Interactive Service, set auto and started. I manually started OpenVPN Client from the start menu, and it works fine.
[23:32:11] <ke4nhw> Why can I not get it to start as a service with the boot of the machine but the Interactive connects. Anything I'm missing?
[23:33:16] <ke4nhw> PS: The key does not have a password so it can be started automatically.
