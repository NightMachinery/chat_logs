[02:38:58] <ski> "Prolog 64" (v1.2) in 1986 by Berthold Daum (maybe <http://www.berthold-daum.de/> ?) -- <https://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/onrequest/collections.html#other>,<https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/PROLOG_64>,<https://www.forum64.de/index.php?thread/44191-prolog-64/>
[02:44:27] <ski> i've noticed two bugs in lib for DCG expansion. also i'm wondering if i could patch the tracer to add some additional commands
[02:45:50] <ski> and i'm thinking it doesn't do LCO, which would be desirable .. but it might be quite involved to do (i dunno how it does uninstantiation, choice-points). (also i'd want it to fail immediately when the last clause fails, rather than first attempting to redo, failing to find any more clauses)
[02:46:58] <ski> (it also represents conjunctions internally the same as lists .. which seems to cause some issues for DCG e.g.)

[02:50:11] <ski> however, i'd need to delve into disassembling the machine code (apart from the lib fixes, and some more useful lib predicates which i'm currently playing around with defining (some more reversable arithmetic .. no attributes/constraints, though))

[02:52:24] *** Joins: pbone (~pbone@120.21.128.146)
[02:56:56] <ski> also wondering how to handle error situations. obviously there's no throw/1. there is "division error" (by zero) and "primitive error" (invalid integer parameter, invalid arithmetical expression (including uninstantiated)) which i could perhaps use .. although i'd like to separate uninstantiated from type and from domain
[02:57:41] <ski> oh, and you apparently can trap errors somehow by defining error/0 (haven't tried yet) .. but that gives you no context at all :/
[02:58:28] <ski> hm .. and the manual is in german

[19:40:19] <amazigh> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5xgX3xup_hBHwaxwV_X0nHxOPH7INh9aaVVwhQqnMc/edit
[19:40:56] <amazigh> btw kuddoz for terminusdb dbaas offering that ought to be a great success for prolog community (IIRC part of it is written with prolog)
[19:41:47] <amazigh> also, I think I need to learn prolog again, I keep stumbling upon prolog-like problems or insightful ideas
[19:42:33] <amazigh> like the recent strange loop key note by William Byrd on quines that rely on minikanren (I know it is not prolog)
