[02:55:46] <MetaNova> um
[02:55:48] <MetaNova> neither
[02:56:02] <jcbjoe2021> so leave it blank?
[02:56:04] <MetaNova> yes
[02:56:09] <jcbjoe2021> ok let me resetup znc
[02:56:24] <jcbjoe2021> MetaNova: what password is it asking for?
[02:56:34] <MetaNova> asking for where?
[02:56:52] <jcbjoe2021> on this client it ask for a password either znc or sasl
[02:57:06] <jcbjoe2021> don't i point to the znc server for the address?
[02:57:12] <jcbjoe2021> and port
[02:57:17] <MetaNova> .... yes
[02:57:33] <MetaNova> to log into ZNC, your client must send a server password

[02:58:39] <jcbjoe2021> If your client is broken and doesn't support specifying username in well... username, you can use username@clientid/network:password as the password. ?
[02:58:54] <MetaNova> correct
[02:58:57] <jcbjoe2021> ok

[04:14:33] <Hash> Hi
[04:14:37] <Hash> My bind host doesn't seem to be working
[04:14:43] <DarthGandalf> !d Hash
[04:14:44] <ZNC-Linker> Hash, when asking for help, be sure to provide as many details as possible: What did you try to do, how exactly did you try it (step by step), all error messages, ZNC version, bindhosts, etc. Without details, the only possible answer is 'Hash, you're doing something wrong.'
[04:15:10] <Hash> Oh sorry 
[04:15:52] <Hash>  [Hash] (~Hash@thestonedapes.com): Hash <- so this is what IRC shows. My bind host is hashsecurity.org  *status: This user's default bind host is hashsecurity.org
[04:16:28] <Hash> 2001:19f0:8001:1ff7::1 == hashsecurity.org rDNS 
[04:16:34] <DarthGandalf> $ host 149.28.12.253
[04:16:34] <DarthGandalf> 253.12.28.149.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer thestonedapes.com.
[04:16:46] <Hash> There is only one A record for it, ipv4. No AAA record for ipv6
[04:17:00] <DarthGandalf> hashsecurity.org has both A and AAAA
[04:17:02] <Hash> the bindhost is ipv6 only
[04:17:05] <DarthGandalf> no, it's not
[04:17:12] <DarthGandalf> $ host hashsecurity.org
[04:17:12] <DarthGandalf> hashsecurity.org has address 149.28.12.253
[04:17:12] <DarthGandalf> hashsecurity.org has IPv6 address 2001:19f0:8001:1ff7::1
[04:17:12] <DarthGandalf> hashsecurity.org mail is handled by 10 thestonedapes.com.
[04:17:14] <Hash> Oh I mistakenly didn't see it
[04:17:20] <Hash> Correct, forward/reverse matches
[04:17:27] <Hash> However, ZNC didn't pick it up.
[04:17:49] <DarthGandalf> Did you change the DNS recently?
[04:17:53] <Hash> No
[04:18:04] <DarthGandalf> Forward/reverse does NOT match
[04:18:14] <DarthGandalf> It does for AAAA record, but not for A record
[04:18:18] <Hash> Correct
[04:18:26] <Hash> I'm only worried about 6, and not 4
[04:18:32] <Hash> Is it possible to force 6 only for znc?
[04:18:47] <DarthGandalf> Set bindhost to  2001:19f0:8001:1ff7::1
[04:19:00] <Hash> Will that show the domain?
[04:19:22] <DarthGandalf> As long as forward/reverse DNS matches, yeah
[04:19:26] <Hash> Ok thanks
[04:19:29] <Hash> Trying now
[04:20:03] <Hash> Rest of my vhost domains don't have an A, only ipv6 so they work just fine. It's the v4 on this particular domain A that's making it fail I see.
[04:20:33] <DarthGandalf> If both bindhost and the server host have both IPv4 and IPv6 available, the family will be chosen by random
[04:20:49] <Hash> I see.
[04:21:11] <Hash> But if you specify an ip address, 4 or 6, and if the for/rev matches, it will display the domain and bind to 4 or 6?
[04:21:32] <DarthGandalf> I don't think you understand how that works at all
[04:21:41] <DarthGandalf> Server doesn't see the hostname
[04:21:47] <DarthGandalf> It sees connection from IP. Always
[04:21:48] <Hash> I thought that's what you mean.t
[04:22:04] <DarthGandalf> Then it queries DNS to see the hostname of that IP
[04:22:22] <Hash>  DarthGandalf | Set bindhost to  2001:19f0:8001:1ff7::1 -- DarthGandalf | As long as forward/reverse DNS matches, yeah <- I was reiterating my understanding of this
[04:22:22] <DarthGandalf> And usually it also checks that DNS whether it has the IP
[04:22:36] <DarthGandalf> <Hash> Will that show the domain?
[04:23:01] <DarthGandalf> > it will display the domain and bind to 4 or 6?
[04:23:06] <DarthGandalf> I don't understand this question
[04:23:18] <Hash> So if I set it to an IP like you said, and the forward/reverse matches, it will show hashsecurity.org and not the ipv6, right?
[04:23:37] <DarthGandalf> unless e.g. DNS server was down at that moment
[04:23:44] <Hash> I see
[04:24:06] <Hash> I did this. 
[04:24:20] <Hash> I will disconnect and reconnect now. I changed the setting in web admin

[04:26:45] <Hash> Ok thanks DarthGandalf 
[04:27:27] <Hash> DarthGandalf: maybe a suggestion for the developers (thanks for the znc): maybe there can be a featuer to turn on/off 4/6 as you please? Turn off 6 or 4 altogether or keep both. 
[04:28:27] <DarthGandalf> you can already do that by specifying the ipv4-only bind host, or by only adding a ipv4 (6) address to list of servers
[04:28:40] <Hash> I see
[04:28:45] <DarthGandalf> why a separate setting needed?
[04:29:57] <Hash> So you mean I should connect to the libera.chat ipv6 address
[04:30:15] <Hash> irc.ipv6.libera.chat
[04:30:45] <Hash> And then since I'm using 6 to connect, it will just use the v6 ip resolution instead of 4 for my host
[04:30:52] <Hash> I hope I understood some bit of this
[04:31:15] <DarthGandalf> if irc.ipv6.libera.chat doesn't resolve to an ipv4 address, yeah

[08:00:27] <jcbjoe2021> Nope. Anyone my nick keeps changing for some reason says I’m known as. Looked at znc web admin and didn’t see anything that relates. Any ideas?

[08:02:20] <jcbjoe2021> Maybe my client Nick and znc Nick are different
[08:03:30] <gothkat> That is odd jcbjoe2021. there should only be one nick at least in configurations that i understand
[08:04:01] <gothkat> The server can change your nick but they usually tell you why. like nickserv forcing you off a nick someone else owns
[08:05:43] <jcbjoe2021> Ok
[08:06:01] <jcbjoe2021> Gothkat: let me re-setup my client
[08:07:38] <gothkat> Is it just random nicks? or like a guest##### or something generic like that?
[08:11:37] <jcbjoe2021> Gothkat: it changes my nick from uppercase to lower case J to j
[08:11:50] <jcbjoe2021> Did it show me disconnect?
[08:14:44] <gothkat> Nope. nothing changed here. 
[08:15:47] <jcbjoe2021> Ok it must all be in my side then. Took me three hours to setup znc 😀it working I know what to do. Canceled my subscription with irccloud I’m good 
[08:17:22] <gothkat> Nice upgrade
[08:18:02] <gothkat> i wanted to like irccloud. my znc is donated by someone who repaid the favour like a decade ago and i wanted to stop being a leech but irccloud just always bothered me
[08:19:21] <jcbjoe2021> Yea 
[08:20:12] <jcbjoe2021> Got like a remote server today free for a month $5 to auth I think actually it’s free for 60 days. Setup znc welcome to 2021
[08:25:19] <gothkat> i started down that path and even got it running but there were just too many things i wasn't comfortable with
[08:25:31] <gothkat> and my donated one is ok for my needs
[08:29:05] <jcbjoe2021> Yes. I think I got that checked off my bucket list. Irccloud I didn’t know what I was doing I just payed and was connected. This one I feel like I know what to do and I can just ask in here or all over 😀

[09:58:22] <jcbjoe2021> It’s probably the module itself got it from https://github.com/jpnurmi/znc-playback/blob/master/playback.cpp
[10:10:11] <bookworm> you're compiling html
[10:10:37] <bookworm> or well, trying to. html is not valid source code as far as c++ is concerned
[10:11:05] <bookworm> meaning, you asked wget / curl to download the wrong thing
[10:12:02] <bookworm> you always need to point it at a raw url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpnurmi/znc-playback/master/playback.cpp 7n your case
[10:12:30] <bookworm> and by it I mean curl
[10:23:05] <jcbjoe2021> Ok
