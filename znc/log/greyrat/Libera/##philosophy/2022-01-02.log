[05:20:11] <biys> in one instance i'm kind of surprised that he wasn't considered a bastion of light for the left
[05:20:55] <biys> i'd say what he says about the young child finding some kind of person they can speak with and that helps them navigate the world and feel comfortable with themself doesn't seem unreasonable.  we do this all the time when we talk about the nuclear family and the importance of a mother and a father figure
[05:21:24] <biys> he was just, in this instance, saying it as it related to his situation
[05:21:35] <biys> where he claims at a young age he was subejct to something inappropriate
[05:21:43] <biys> and he found ways to say that it actually HELPED him

[05:38:19] <biys> i think we could take two logical positions on it.  we say that homosexuality is a matter entirely of biology.  it's like brown hair or blue eyes.  in which case we'd have to accept that a homosexual child could be born and could experience a world very strange to them if they're unaware of their difference.
[05:38:29] <biys> i'd think this could be problematic for development
[05:38:50] <biys> the other side would be something like...  it's a notion of nurture
[05:41:25] <biys> i remember i had this english teacher who's writing, on the chaulk board, was basically trash.  he'd always apologize like a madman and tell us the same story about how when he was younger he'd use his left hand but his parents always took everything out of his left hand and put it in his right hand

[05:48:33] <audrey> I mean, to me it doesn´t really matter if homosexuality is a choice or not
[05:48:56] <audrey> This is what I was trying to get at, perhaps too vaguely, with my silly comment about «what´s wrong with sodomy»
[05:50:14] <audrey> I´ve never felt particularly enthused about the «Born This Way» slogan because it seems to be subtly implying that there actually is something wrong/shameful about homosexual love and homosexual intercourse, such that we have to justify it by saying «we can´t help but do it.»
[05:54:02] <audrey> Without getting too graphic - why would a certain combination of genitals be «wrong» and another «right», a priori? Sexual intercourse is ... pretty nasty in general, if you think about it dispassionately.

[06:31:13] <Ungwelian> Delf, perhaps you have a more than 24h internal clock?
[06:31:30] <Ungwelian> I mean, it's a real medical thing.
[06:31:46] <Ungwelian> And there's nothing wrong with it either, except that it can make life a bit difficult.
[06:32:03] <Ungwelian> Or well, very difficult at times.
[06:33:55] <Delf> I'd say there something seriously wrong
[06:35:44] <Ungwelian> Get it checked. I'm diagnosed with more than 24h circadian rhythm.
[06:36:15] <Ungwelian> The diagnosis itself won't cure anything, but it can make it easier to deal with stuff.
[06:36:19] <Ungwelian> For you, and for others too.

[06:40:21] <Delf> What's your view on homosexuality?
[06:40:23] <Ungwelian> With me, if I try and force a regular sleeping time, it tends to cause insomnia.
[06:40:47] <Ungwelian> If I let the rhythm move forwards freely, I go to bed tired and sleep enough.
[06:41:28] <Ungwelian> Oh, I think it's entirely ok, like other forms of LGBTQ+.
[06:41:47] <Delf> I feel best when I just sleep whenever I'm tired enough but that fucks up the cycles. Strange enough I end up on a perfect nightshift which is to say what? not more or less than 24h internal cycle but rather nocturnal?

[08:05:05] <causative_> sure, but what's consciousness?
[08:05:37] <causative_> I think we'll have human-level AI within 50 years, perhaps a lot sooner
[08:07:49] <causative_> what is needed is mostly a better way to train recurrent networks over very long time periods (millions or billions of steps)
[08:07:57] <causative_> better than backprop
[08:11:15] <causative_> the problem of backprop, aside from vanishing/exploding gradient, is the need to store an amount of data on each neuron proportional to the time period you want to backpropagate over
[08:11:20] * audrey applies rare earth magnets to all supercomputers
[08:11:40] <causative_> that's not biologically realistic, and it's not practical if you have millions or billions of timesteps

[08:32:50] <causative_> the goals don't have to be malicious to be very dangerous; the classic example is the "paperclip maximizer" which is a superintelligent AI that wants to make as many paperclips as it can (because someone tasked it with management of a paperclip factory)
[08:33:12] <causative_> in the end, the "paperclip maximizer" could convert all of Earth into paperclips and keep anyone from shutting it off
[08:36:42] <causative_> we might have some chance of controlling an AI that's only humanly intelligent, but a humanly intelligent AI isn't going to drastically advance medicine more than an actual human could
[08:37:32] <causative_> so what will happen is, we'll get our human-level AI and try to keep it to that level, and it will be cheap labor, but not a genius - because if we gave it enough hardware to be a genius, we couldn't control it

[08:50:09] <Delf> And if it finds the purpose it has isn't coherent?
[08:52:50] <causative_> then it was programmed wrong and might do anything - probably it's not a friendly AI
[08:53:14] <Delf> We're good at that, programmig wrong :D
[08:53:14] <causative_> it's a danger to humanity rather than an ethical problem

[19:30:23] <biys> audrey: it was more-so related to the context of normal.  lets say, generally speaking, that children are born to hetero couples.  hetero couples that aren't aware of what it means to be homosexual
[19:30:45] <biys> it is likely that heter couple, given their understanding of the world, wouldn't necessarily be able to answer their childres questions (not all of them anyways)
[19:31:02] <biys> there would be aspects of the childs biology they wouldn't be able to account for given their experience/undertanding of the world
[19:31:31] <biys> they could likely damage that child in some way or another inadvertently
[19:31:40] <biys> kind of like i'd say this teacher was "damaged"
[19:31:54] <biys> not necessarily to the same extent, but to some extent given the circumstance
[19:32:50] <biys> instead of being able to receive the support they necessarily need, the understanding, the context to the world
[19:33:08] <biys> they walk around experiencing the world from a prespective that won't be their own
[19:34:39] <biys> which is why i said it's weird that the left didn't embrace milo's sentiments
[19:35:08] <biys> if what we're doing is looking to be understanding and promote compassion and reduce harm
[19:35:11] *** Quits: ethrl (~ethereal@user/doforlove33) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[19:35:27] <biys> we should understand that homosexuality is a potential norm and what milo said wasn't strange at all
[19:35:45] <biys> he's suggesting a homosexual support group for children (which afaik exist now)
[19:38:08] <biys> which is why i said i understand why he was deplatformed by the trad right
[19:38:13] <biys> conservatives
[19:38:25] <biys> but the left should have embraced his views in this sense
[19:41:58] <Ungwelian> One problem with the current situation is that sex educator courses cost an arm and a leg, at least in Finland.
[19:42:40] <Ungwelian> And that applies for heteros too.
[19:44:01] <Ungwelian> Plenty of people are ashamed to talk about sex, so teens learn where they can. Including the absolute worst places: porn.
[19:44:32] <Ungwelian> Then the result is people who think that sex is bad if it's not some kind of porn movie re-enactment.
[19:49:37] <biys> 3rd wave feminists believe that sex is inherently harmful though
[19:49:48] <Ungwelian> They do?
[19:50:02] <biys> hah
[19:50:32] <biys> i think second wave to some extent too
[19:50:46] <Ungwelian> How?
[19:51:01] <biys> it reduces the woman to an inferior state and can only occur under conditions of oppression and hatred
[19:51:22] <biys> the implicit assumption that in a state of full freedom women would not have sex with men
[19:52:25] <biys> many feminists do explicitly claim that women are harmed by sex, esoecially penetrative sex
[19:52:36] <Ungwelian> I've read some extreme feminists' thoughts, who think that penetrative sex reduces a woman to a recipient.
[19:53:01] <Ungwelian> Honestly, I think those people have mental problems.
[19:53:11] <biys> i'd say there's no foundation of sexual morality
[19:53:21] <biys> it's an unfalsifiable hypothesis

[19:55:07] <Ungwelian> That kind of thinking from them perpetuates the idea of women as victims, instead of empowering women as equals.
[19:55:29] <Ungwelian> And sex has been a typical issues how women have been put under the boot.
[19:55:30] <biys> well JBP comes to mind when we start talking about equals
[19:55:49] <biys> and he references the divide in the scandinavian countries regardless their attempts at equity
[19:56:04] <biys> where women still choose to become people who help people
[19:56:11] <biys> and men still choose to be obsessed with ideas
[19:56:24] <Ungwelian> Yeah, that's capitalism abusing the same myth.
[19:56:46] <Ungwelian> Most nurses here are women and they're shamed about not liking their low wages.
[19:56:48] <biys> i don't really agree with that.  women are tasked with growing a baby inside of th em and then they have to nurse the baby for a significant amount of time after
[19:56:55] <biys> men do not and have never had to do that
[19:57:16] <biys> it would be nonsense to suggest that the result of that isn't some kind of psychological biological
[19:58:08] <Ungwelian> One particularly egregious occasion was, when the healthcare bosses sent the nurses a "thank you card" instead of any kind of wage raises, during corona time.
[19:58:22] <Ungwelian> With the added cherry on the cake, that the nurses had to print the card themselves.
[19:58:34] <Ungwelian> And then give it to patients, who may or may not want to thank them.
[19:58:49] * biys blinks
[19:59:03] <Ungwelian> All this carried with the idea, that nurse women are charitable helpers.
[19:59:22] <biys> i would say you'd have to be insane if you wanted to be a nurse but didn't like helping people
[20:00:34] <Ungwelian> In Finland, people are also pressured to become nurses.
[20:00:45] <Ungwelian> The education is short and has low entrance qualifications.
[20:00:50] <biys> anyways, the cathy newman interview basically summarizes the flaws within the argument surrounding equal wages
[20:01:09] <biys> it's essentially a multi variable analysis
[20:01:17] <biys> there's no signifiacnt generalization that can be made about it
[20:01:42] <biys> significant SINGULAR generalization
[20:01:48] <biys> to do so would be a drastic oversimplification
[20:01:59] <Ungwelian> I'd like there to be an equal wage, all through society, regardless of profession.
[20:02:06] <biys> i bet you would

[20:05:06] <audrey> <biys> 3rd wave feminists believe that sex is inherently harmful though
[20:05:16] <audrey> this is flatly false from everything I know about third-wave feminism
[20:05:45] <audrey> there is a contingent of radical feminists/2nd-wave feminists who would agree with this notion, but definitely nothing near the mainstream liberal (3rd wave) feminism today
[20:07:45] <biys> arguable
[20:07:55] <biys> but i don't think that point is entirely important
[20:08:06] <mannequin> i almost died on friday
[20:09:04] <biys> i mean... women defnitely have the upper hand when it comes to sex
[20:09:06] <biys> generally speaking
[20:09:18] <biys> men don't have the social restrictions
[20:09:22] <audrey> How so?
[20:09:38] <biys> do you see any incel websites devote to women?
[20:09:54] <audrey> I could as easily say - women are the ones who are much more likely to get raped; women are the ones who have to deal with pregnancy and all those consequences
[20:10:23] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[20:10:35] <biys> oh for sure
[20:10:50] <biys> i'm not sure what point you're trying to make here though
[20:10:51] <audrey> Well, biys, you are assuming that there are no other biological or socialization differences between men and women
[20:10:58] <biys> what is your counter-argument?
[20:11:07] <audrey> I'm not sure what your argument is, to be honest.
[20:11:08] <biys> i never said that
[20:11:29] <biys> i asid there is a ton of variables that go into the wage difference
[20:11:36] <biys> they can't just be summarized as some kind of systemic problem
[20:11:50] <audrey> My only point here (not really a thesis) is that there may be other explanations why "women incels" are not a phenomenon.
[20:12:00] <audrey> Other than merely "women have it easier at sex".
[20:12:32] <audrey> Could also be that women on average find sex less interesting than men, are less motivated to seek it out, and/or are less likely to publicly complain about a lack of sexual access compared to men.
[20:12:34] <biys> so you're suggesting that there's likely an equal amount of women to men that feel as though their sexual desires aren't fulfilled?
[20:12:49] <biys> and it isn't over-represented by men
[20:13:30] <audrey> Also, most of the sexual outliers - when it comes to the extremes of libido, paraphilias, etc. - are occupied by men
[20:13:59] <audrey> So it's not surprising to me why "incel" types are predominantly men, and this doesn't really tell me anything meaningful about women's sexuality.
[20:14:02] <biys> i could definitely outline multiple proofs to show that women hold the upper hand when it comes to sexual intercourse
[20:14:17] <biys> sex is definitely weaponized
[20:14:56] <biys> but that isn't really what the conversation was about initially
[20:15:21] <audrey> Also, frankly, I have no idea what straight women are like, or if you can even generalize them in this fashion (unlikely).
[20:15:34] <audrey> So I'm not really the best person to be making this sort of analysis.
[20:15:47] <audrey> in many ways I have a pretty masculine temperament/attitudes
[20:16:13] <audrey> Hmm, what was the conversation about initially? Were we talking about homosexuality or what
[20:16:25] <biys> we weer talkina bout milo being a "moron"
[20:16:34] <biys> i thought you would have definitely liked what he said
[20:16:39] <biys> but i could be completely off base
[20:16:53] <biys> he was atempting to remove hetero normal stereotypes
[20:16:54] <biys> essentially
[20:18:06] <audrey> Well, you have a better ability to take Milo at face value than I do. All I see is an attention whore.
[20:18:28] <arryana> thanks for getting rid of betelgeuse, audrey.
[20:18:31] <audrey> Really not much there I can engage with unless we zoom the camera lens out and talk more about the object level ideas rather than the personality
[20:18:32] <biys> in some cases i view people based on their presentation
[20:18:41] <biys> in other cases i view people based on what they say
[20:19:10] <biys> if you scroll back to when i started typing this morning
[20:19:15] <audrey> my pleasure, arryana. please ping me if it becomes a problem again - I set the ban to expire in 24 hours
[20:19:16] <biys> you'll see the exact argument in about 10-15 lines
[20:19:24] <audrey> but I'll make it longer if he continues not to fix his connection
[20:20:02] <audrey> I mean, I don't think there is such a huge gulf of understanding between heterosexuals and homosexuals.
[20:20:18] <biys> no?
[20:20:37] <biys> why is there such problems though with homosexuals feeling apart of society?
[20:20:41] <audrey> There are things like "gay culture" and "the scene" which we popularly associate with homosexuality, but which are not by any means representative of gay people as a whole.
[20:20:45] <biys> why do they need to fight for so much rights/understanding?
[20:21:23] <audrey> biys: Are there problems? Assuming we're talking about the West here. IDK, I don't feel alienated from society on the basis of my sexuality. (Alienated for other reasons, yes, but sex is not one of them.)
[20:21:41] <biys> i'm so confused
[20:21:47] <biys> we must live in different worlds
[20:21:53] <audrey> The civil rights battles have largely been won and gay rights is now passe to talk about in all but the most extreme right wing Western parties.
[20:22:01] <biys> what i see is LGBTQ++ constantly talking about needing to break down walls
[20:22:07] <biys> and constantly talking about how they're marginalized members of society
[20:22:08] <biys> yada yada
[20:22:19] <audrey> biys: The alphabet people? Those don't represent me
[20:22:29] <biys> i wouldn't say you represent homsoexuals either
[20:22:35] <biys> that isn't the conversation
[20:23:01] <audrey> biys: "LGBTQ+" is not "gay people", it's a kind of political movement/ideology, if you will.
[20:23:06] <biys> regardless your ideas to suggest that homosexual people aren't currently in a "battle" attempting to "defeat" their marginalization is...
[20:23:09] <biys> kind of weird
[20:23:25] <audrey> I don't identify as "queer". I detest that label.
[20:23:51] <audrey> And frankly I don't even like bringing up my sexuality in real life. Much less make it a political issue.
[20:24:05] <audrey> Maybe I'm the one out on the fringes here.
[20:24:19] <biys> all i have to do is turn on CBC radio one
[20:24:25] <biys> and spend 15-20 minutes lifting
[20:24:37] <audrey> But it seems like a mistake to suggest that the mainstream LGBTQ movement somehow represents all gay (or trans) people
[20:24:40] <biys> and they will be attempting to lift homosexual voices about heterosexual in order to elevate their perspective
[20:24:49] <biys> oh yah.   for sure
[20:24:56] <biys> i could see why feminists would hate trans men
[20:24:58] <audrey> biys: Well that's your problem, you are taking this at face value
[20:25:27] <biys> i wouldn't say it's my mistake
[20:25:41] <biys> i would say it's what the canadian government wants us to think
[20:25:54] <biys> keep in mind our PM platforms on equality/inclusion pretty much all the time
[20:25:56] <arryana> that's an interesting point, audrey.
[20:26:10] <arryana> i don't identify as 'queer' either, though i've had relationships with both men and women.
[20:26:23] <arryana> and even being married to a man, i still fool around with women from time to time, in a limited way.
[20:27:16] <arryana> i can't say i really understand the militant stance of any 'group identity', for the most part.
[20:27:20] <arryana> people are just people.
[20:27:34] <audrey> biys: So there are two issues here that need to be teased apart. The first issue is, what you hear in the mass media about "diversity, equity, inclusion". In my (biased) opinion, a lot of that is simply politically motivated. The other thing is what' s your average gay man or lesbian or trans person thinks or experiences.
[20:27:34] <biys> i hate the group identity game
[20:27:38] <biys> but it's the game fostered by the left
[20:27:47] <audrey> Those two things do not coincide, and I would argue they don't even overlap that much.
[20:28:18] <biys> it's an easy way to talk about the situation without having to give too much context
[20:28:43] <audrey> Easy, but very misleading, IMO.
[20:28:53] <biys> audrey: so just so we're clear on this.  you seem to be suggesting that there are currently no initiatives in MSM or anywhere that are assocaited with elevating the voices of marginalzied people?  in this case specifically homosexuals?
[20:29:08] <biys> the "normalization" of particular ideas assocaited with homosexuality?
[20:29:34] <biys> i mean.  a hockey player comes out as gay
[20:29:37] <audrey> biys: That's not what I suggested. What I suggested is that the civil rights battles in the West have already been won regarding homosexuality (and transsexuality, most recently).
[20:29:39] <biys> and he's "so brave"
[20:29:45] <biys> "such a good example for your homosexuals everywhere"
[20:29:56] <biys> s/your/young/
[20:29:56] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: "such a good example for young homosexuals everywhere"
[20:30:09] <audrey> biys: On top of this, you have a layer of cruft from identity-politics ideologues who try to get political mileage out of this
[20:30:22] <arryana> i suspect time is an issue here.  if i recall my sociology days, it takes two or three generations to really get past any major social issue.  so in another fifteen years or so the prevailing attitude on homosexuality/gender identity will be 'who cares'
[20:30:50] <audrey> biys: I view those two things as being largely disconnected.
[20:31:46] <Ungwelian> There's a lot of work still in trans rights.
[20:31:50] <biys> a movie is released that portrays a "Strong homsoexual" character isn't mentioned on the news?
[20:32:09] <audrey> I think we're talking past each other here, biys
[20:32:13] <biys> yup
[20:32:22] <audrey> You're looking at mass media and trying to form conclusions about reality on the basis of what mass media reports.
[20:32:24] <Ungwelian> For example, genital reconstruction surgery is covered by the government, but facial feminization surgery isn't.
[20:32:26] <biys> because it seems like you're attempting to argue against what i can clearly google
[20:32:38] <biys> so i'm kind of not really understanding what you're attempting to say
[20:32:42] <biys> i mean... just open up google news
[20:32:46] <audrey> I certainly don't dispute that Western media continues to coo about "omg so brave, came out as trans/gay/etc."
[20:32:47] <biys> and spend 15 minutes looking through the headlines
[20:32:54] <biys> it will definitely suggest something other than what you're saying
[20:33:08] <audrey> What I dispute is that this is relevant to the everyday lives of gay/trans people I know
[20:33:15] <audrey> it's kind of static noise, in a way
[20:33:17] <Delf> Ungwelian: Does that mean I get to carry a child?
[20:33:36] <audrey> Or, more generally.
[20:33:44] <arryana> do you want kids, delf?
[20:33:55] <audrey> Delf: Adoption is better anyway, IMO.
[20:34:19] <Delf> arryana: Not my own but the thought of being able to grown one inside is interesting
[20:34:26] <Ungwelian> Delf, I'm afraid science hasn't been able to progress far enough for womb transplants and so on yet. That is, if you need one :P
[20:34:30] <Delf> audrey: Any day
[20:36:01] <Delf> Imagine we're born without gender and we get to pick later on and we get to switch also, like frogs
[20:36:25] <Ungwelian> There's some scifi where that's possible.
[20:36:36] <Ungwelian> Like Iain Bank's "Culture" -series.
[20:36:44] <Delf> Not familiar
[20:36:49] <Ungwelian> I love it.
[20:37:02] <biys> audrey: i mean... our local city hall and police station suspends rainbow flags
[20:37:07] <Delf> I'm not against switching gender but... "genital reconstruction" sounds to me like gender mutilation rather
[20:37:25] <arryana> i've thought about the concept often since childhood, as one of my (girl) cousins was a thalidomide baby.  she doesn't have a womb, so always knew she'd never have kids of her own.
[20:37:26] <audrey> biys: IMO that is little different from the "Workers Unite" signs that Vaclav Havel's greengrocer puts up.
[20:37:47] <arryana> it never particularly defined her, though
[20:37:49] <Ungwelian> It's far from that. GRS retains functionality and makes for happier people.
[20:38:21] <audrey> biys: if you live in one of the more socially liberal Canadian provinces this would make more sense
[20:38:27] <arryana> i've never carried a baby either, though i possess the equipment.  i'm not sure any of that really matters in the end.
[20:38:46] <audrey> the Trudeau administration & company has really leaned hard into a particular reading of identity politics
[20:39:30] <arryana> the older i get, the happier i am that i never had kids.
[20:39:51] <arryana> i can't tell you how many of my friends are either supporting their grown children or raising their grandkids.
[20:39:56] <Delf> arryana: We're not defined by our equipments or whether we use them or not. I'm a good example. I have brains, but I don't use them, that doesn't define me.
[20:40:13] <arryana> indeed, that's much my point.

[20:44:49] <Delf> I love kids! I just don't want to be the reason they're conceived
[20:45:15] <arryana> raising kids, if done right, is all-consuming.  and i just don't think that's for most people.
[20:45:28] <arryana> however, social pressure validates the idea that everyone should do it
[20:45:40] <arryana> i find that a bit baffling

[21:03:51] <arryana> and she turned to him and very calmly said, 'sweetheart, you're just going to have to work that out in therapy when you are older because we are -late-'
[21:04:08] <arryana> he stared at her for about five seconds, then went to get his woody doll, and got in the car without another word.
[21:04:27] <arryana> i treasure that memory
[21:04:47] <Delf> His reaction to it did the other half
[21:05:05] <arryana> well, by four he realized that tantrums weren't going to get him anywhere.
[21:05:16] <Delf> If he continued screaming and repeating, it wouldn't have been a different story
[21:05:30] <arryana> his sister tried it on until she was six or so, but she was always the more emotionally volatile one

[21:13:01] <arryana> though my response also depends on the maturity level/basic abilities of the kid
[21:13:12] <Delf> Because it wouldn't work because it may not work with you, but with others it will work

[21:13:29] <Delf> They will get what they want when they throw tantrums, from others
[21:13:54] <arryana> with the more reasonable ones, i simply banish them in a non-punitive way.  like, 'nope.  as long as you're bahving that way this isn't a discussion.  go sit in the hammock and watch -one- episode of spongebob until you calm down, then we can talk about it'
[21:14:04] <arryana> behaving
[21:14:19] <Delf> Interesting approach
[21:14:28] <arryana> well, i don't see dismissing a kid's feelings entirely as the most effective way to teach them self control

[21:16:09] <arryana> ah, a helicopter parent
[21:16:18] <Delf> No
[21:16:45] <arryana> i guess i'm too old for that.  i expect a kid to work through a mocidum of their own issue and then come to me for clarification when they're ready
[21:17:04] <Delf> There is that when possible
[21:17:27] <arryana> i like to think it didn't work out too badly, as my godkid gave me the same role for her kids that i played in her childhood.
[21:18:34] <Delf> Most likely
[21:18:44] <arryana> though lord knows i had more energy thirty years ago
[21:19:20] <Delf> Yea well, you got to work with what you have, not with what you don't have
[21:19:37] <arryana> that thinking is what excuses a lot of bad parenting, don't you think?
[21:20:45] <arryana> five or six years ago i asked my goddaughter what phrase she dreaded hearing from me the most.
[21:20:50] <Delf> There are no excuses for bad parenting
[21:21:03] <arryana> she didn't even have to think about it.  she said, 'go ahead, let me know how that works out for you'
[21:21:50] <Delf> G’aun yersel!!
[21:21:55] <arryana> until she was seven or so, she'd try whatever misguided idea it was.  after that she'd give me the stare that didn't quite dare to be a dirty look, but not try it.
[21:22:18] <arryana> still, i don't think i'd be a particularly great parent.  it isn't my road.
[21:22:52] <Delf> If I had to pick my parents vs you, I'd pick you any day

[21:26:46] <arryana> and as to raising a kid like myself, fuck no. i was an appallingly willful kid.
[21:27:39] <arryana> the first time i drove 500 miles, i was 11 years old.
[21:27:44] <Delf> Appallingly willful kid... why does that sound like a bad thing. Is it a bad thing. My English sucks
[21:28:05] <arryana> oh yeah.
[21:28:17] <Delf> Then in that case you dodged a bullet or few
[21:28:20] <arryana> i remember the first official war with my parents
[21:28:35] <arryana> i was six, and i wanted to sleep outside.  so every night i'd climb out my window and sleep under a bush.
[21:28:45] <arryana> i'd come in in the morning, take my beating, and go to school.
[21:28:55] <arryana> what do you do with a kid who doesn't care how you punish them?
[21:29:45] <Delf> You wouldn't want to know :)
[21:29:48] <arryana> i mean, you can't let a six year old sleep outside
[21:29:57] <arryana> and you can only beat them so hard
[21:30:06] <arryana> they tried taking my toys, my clothes, everything.
[21:30:22] <arryana> there was no punishment that meant anything to me as much as doing what i wanted.
[21:30:50] <arryana> i would never want to raise a kid like that.
[21:31:38] <Delf> It takes certain kind of parent to make a kid like that
[21:32:03] <Delf> Let me guess, they didn't spend much time connecting with you, did they?
[21:33:03] <Delf> I'd take a kid like that any day, granted, they need more work but it'll be worth it
[21:34:27] * arryana shrugs
[21:35:02] <arryana> it was me, not then.
[21:35:05] <arryana> them
[21:35:22] <Delf> So they did spend much time connecting with you
[21:35:34] <arryana> uh
[21:35:44] <arryana> it was the 70s.  nobody 'spent time connecting' with kids
[21:36:30] <arryana> nor would that have mattered. my grandmothers had nothing but time and patience for me, but i still did what i wanted.
[21:36:38] <arryana> some kids are just hard headed
[21:37:48] <arryana> even now, i can't think of a single thing i'd try on a kid like i was that'd have worked.
[21:37:50] <Delf> During the very early stages, they need to recognize there are dangers in the environment and they need to understand that you're not just part of their environment but a part of them
[21:37:53] <arryana> haha
[21:37:55] <audrey> Spend time connecting with kids? Sounds like a great way to create self absorbed brats. :P
[21:37:57] <arryana> oh man.
[21:38:12] <arryana> again, that assumes i had a care for personal danger or consequences, which i didn't.
[21:38:15] <audrey> "mommy I woke up this morning before 10am, where is my trophy? MOMMY??"
[21:38:35] <Delf> Pain is a great teacher
[21:38:35] <arryana> when i was 12 i took my oldest brother's clippers and crewcut my hair, then applied for a job at the local stable wearing nothing but jeans.
[21:38:47] <audrey> Nice! lol
[21:38:54] <arryana> six months later i got tossed from a rank horse into a tree, i broke my shoulder, collarbone, scapula, and four ribs
[21:38:59] <audrey> Not nice. :(
[21:39:00] <arryana> i was back on the horses inside of six months
[21:39:04] <arryana> i worked there for four more years.
[21:39:19] <arryana> eh, horses are big, they're gonna break bones
[21:39:24] <arryana> those weren't the only ones, either
[21:39:49] <arryana> i still do stupid shit if it looks fun and i figure i'll break three or fewer bones

[21:41:16] <arryana> life is short.  i knew that even when i was young.
[21:41:49] <Delf> Yes but you need to be more careful or life will get even shorter
[21:41:57] * arryana shrugs
[21:42:00] <arryana> that means nothing to me.
[21:42:14] <Delf> I'll translate. It means less time to spend with significant other!
[21:42:18] * arryana shrugs
[21:42:34] <arryana> being how i am has allowed me to have more of life than any ten people deserve.  i'd never trade that for 'safety'
[21:42:42] <Delf> I'll translate again. It means less time for significant other to spend with you
