[02:33:09] <greenbagels> i remember a few years back i asked a professor whether people typically took a dedicated course to measure theory, and i think he said "not usually"
[02:33:51] <greenbagels> so are measure-theory-specific books just meant to go way more in detail than most people would want or something...?
[02:34:14] <greenbagels> as in, substantially beyond what would be covered in like, a graduate real analysis class?
[02:35:02] <isekaijin> My second real analysis course was wholly about measure theory.
[02:35:06] <Z-module> Well, there aren't many such books. The classic one by Halmos does a lot of stuff with more general measrues than you typically ever come across.
[02:35:07] <energizer> i dont think that's all you can say. syntactic abstractions can compose more or less well. they can be more or less ambiguous, more or less context dependent
[02:35:20] <isekaijin> And we used Folland's book.
[02:35:39] <isekaijin> wtf is ‚Äúsyntactic abstraction‚Äù
[02:35:42] <greenbagels> i see; i think folland is used in the real analysis sequence at my old uni
[02:35:43] <isekaijin> Sounds like Lisp propaganda.
[02:36:18] <energizer> i value syntax and semantics, i know not everybody does
[02:36:21] <isekaijin> energizer: But everyone knows abstraction is about the meaning, not the syntax you use for it.

[02:37:00] <greenbagels> ok i guess ill take a break from probability to go learn more real analysis rather than just measure theory
[02:37:03] <isekaijin> If I swap the roles of opening and closing parentheses in math, then the syntax has changed (in an inconvenient way), but the meanings stay the samae.
[02:37:21] <energizer> isekaijin: that's concrete syntax, i'm talking about abstract syntax
[02:37:35] <isekaijin> Even the abstract syntax doesn't matter.
[02:37:56] <energizer> what do you mean by that
[02:38:14] <dude12312414> something something "math is invariant under change of notation"
[02:38:37] <isekaijin> What I mean is that, unless you are a logician, we really don't think of syntax as a mathematical object in its own right.
[02:38:58] <isekaijin> It's something that you use to get a hold of actual, more interesting mathematical objects.

[02:40:51] <isekaijin> I've studied some of it in my free time. But, when you're doing ACTUAL math, like, you know, geometry or analysis or combinatorics or whatever, then suddenly all the formal logic crap goes away.
[02:41:26] <int-e> I don't think it's fair to call it crap.
[02:41:40] <isekaijin> The ‚Äúmanifoldness‚Äù of a manifold is in its geometric properties. You can come up with a formal language for talking about manifolds, but that doesn't mean that a manifold is a piece of syntax.
[02:41:53] <energizer> i know lots of people think notation and syntax don't affect their ability to reason about a domain, i think they are either very different from me or wrong
[02:42:03] <int-e> That's just as wrong as insisiting that all math notation must be explicit about all details in the way formal logic is.
[02:42:43] <int-e> When in reality it's valuable to not spell out the obvious because it would distract from the interesting bits.
[02:43:23] <isekaijin> Don't get me wrong. It isn't math if it can't be translated to formal logic ‚Äúin principle‚Äù.
[02:43:36] <isekaijin> But if you worry too much about the specific translation, then you aren't doing math either.

Even ignoring the stupid case of G = H to falsify that, it's just not true. I wonder what condition he forgot.

[06:40:02] <tusko> That is indeterminate, but two applications of the boy L'Hopitals and we yield \lim_{n \to \infty} | \frac{6n}{12n + 10 + 4/n} |
[06:40:05] <tusko> and then yeah 1/2
[06:40:13] <tusko> Here's the problem I have with this
[06:40:43] <tusko> Computer scientists will say that this means two functions f and g, represented by those functions, are Big-Theta of each other
[06:40:55] <tusko> but haven't we only proven that they both either converge or both diverge?
[06:40:55] <Z-module> MsPoop: what's funny?
[06:41:39] <Z-module> tusko:  divide every summand in there by n^3 and you get what you first had. Limit is 1/2 for sure.
[06:42:04] <Z-module> so no need for stuff about indeterminate forms
[06:42:15] <tusko> Z-Module I tried that but you get 4log(n)/n^2
[06:42:20] <Z-module> that -> 0
[06:42:29] <tusko> oh right, for that term.
[06:42:35] <tusko> I could break it up
[06:42:42] <tusko> wait
[06:42:56] <tusko> can you just say its 0?
[06:43:05] <tusko> oh right, nevermind
[06:43:12] <tusko> I could break it into three limits
[06:43:15] <Z-module> no
[06:44:26] <Z-module> but you have  lim 1/(2 + B(n) + C(n))  where B(n) -> 0 and C(n) -> 0, thus  2 + B(n) + C(n) -> 2 , thus  1/that  -> 1/2
[06:44:35] <Z-module> various lemmas make that all true
[06:48:45] <tusko> how is lim n-> inft |4log(n)/n^2| = 0
[06:48:55] <tusko> I just don't see it log(n) also goes to infinity
[06:49:10] <Z-module> ALso your way with a double use of l'Hopital does work, though you left out a step that it's really about the function x^3/(2x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x log(x))  defined for all x > 0, and then *that* function having limit 1/2 as x goes through all positive reals implies that your sequencce (for just natural values of x) does also.
[06:49:11] <tusko> even though its much slower that n^2
[06:49:57] <int-e> If that fraction is F(n)/G(n) then you've shown that for large enough n, 1/4 < F(n)/G(n) < 1. That's enough for F(n) in Theta(G(n))
[06:50:41] <Z-module> log(x) / x^c -> 0   (as x grows) for every positive constant c.

[08:51:15] <PlanckWalk> Unbounded is enough though.

[10:14:49] <Decker> it is...
[10:14:51] <MsPoop> or that this question is somehow less valid in base 10
[10:14:54] <MsPoop> No.

[11:17:17] <greenbagels> widp: the classic image to demonstrate this is a dart board
[11:17:23] <greenbagels> accuracy is how close you are to the bullseye
[11:17:30] <greenbagels> precision is how spread out your darts are
[11:18:01] <greenbagels> so you can have high accuracy, low precision (the *average* dart position is in the center of the board, but they are spread out all over the place)
[11:18:02] <widp> nice, that makes sense.

[11:20:57] <greenbagels> kind of; in practical situations, we like to assume that any error in measurements or sampling or whatever is some normally distributed "noise"
[11:21:56] <greenbagels> er ok let me walk this back since normality comes in play in a lot of palces
[11:22:18] <greenbagels> widp: basically in many cases the mean of some samples is the best estimate for the true mean
[11:22:21] *** Joins: MsPoop (~MsPoop@S01069050ca4e3573.cg.shawcable.net)

[14:02:43] <Guest61> I'm struggling trying to see what's happening here https://imgur.com/a/L9Gpffa - i'm looking at i) my thoughts are: Steady state implies that the rate of change of density is zero wrt time is zero. Speed = Distance/Time where speed is (i suppose?) the speed at which the density changes. Sub in the numbers to get 10^3 (m)/10days = 0.001ms^-1. Which
[14:02:44] <Guest61> is like an order of magnitude slower than flow rate (0.1ms^-1) therefore flow can be approximated as steady state.
[14:02:48] <Guest61> Does this seem legit?

[21:29:57] <XCode> yes
[21:30:32] <XCode> isekaijin: yeah your right.
[21:30:46] <XCode> Yilo: just take your time with studying you will encounter it in the future.
[21:30:49] <Yilo> :)

[21:32:10] <XCode> you have complex numbers C, C[x] is polynomials in one variables with field being the complex numbers. Affine variety is solution of polynomial in C[x] notice here you can substitute x could be any member of your field.
[21:32:30] <XCode> so essentially the solution solving zeroes of polynomial in C[x] lives in C
[21:32:46] <isekaijin> ‚ÄúProjective‚Äù geometry is called ‚Äúprojective‚Äù because one of its original motivations was to make mathematical sense of perspective drawing. The horizon is ‚Äúinfinitely far away‚Äù, and yet the ‚Äúline of horizon‚Äù is drawn at a finite distance from the viewer.

[21:33:38] <XCode> now projective geometry essentially came from notion of perspective drawing as isekaijin mentioned. We want to like capture the notion of things at infinity imagine like a road picture where the road stretches out to infinity.
[21:33:43] <XCode> we want to capture that mathematically.
[21:33:45] <isekaijin> The usual spaces R^3 or C^3 don't contain ‚Äúpoints at infinity‚Äù, so they couldn't be reasonable mathematical models of the space that is being drawn.

[21:34:43] *** Joins: unknow (~i.am@user/marlboro)
[21:35:01] <XCode> lines at infinity are equivalent so this gives us a way of putting a relation on C^{n + 1} to get that. The reason we have n + 1 is because there is one extra line at infinity
[21:35:12] <XCode> where C is complex numbers
[21:35:22] <XCode> and C^{n + 1} is cartesian product of C n + 1 times
[21:35:40] <XCode> i.e. elements are of the form (z_0,...,z_n) where z_i is in C
[21:35:52] <XCode> The space is as follows
[21:36:13] <XCode> first take C^{n + 1} remove the origin and call that (C^{n + 1})*
[21:37:02] <XCode> P^n = (C^{n + 1})* / ~ where relation is as follows z ~ u iff u = lambda * z where lambda is a constant.
[21:37:15] <XCode> lambda neq = 0
[21:37:36] <XCode> this turns out to be compact and we can identify line at infinity by [0,0,0,...,1]
[21:38:25] <XCode> where [0,0,...,1] is the equivalence class of (0,0,...,1)
[21:38:50] <XCode> a polynomial is homogenous if all monomials have the same degree
[21:39:10] <XCode> x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is a homogenous polynomial

[22:35:38] <lesshaste> I think I am being braindead. The rastrigin function is given at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastrigin_function . In 2d the max is apparently at (0,0) where you get the value 0. That I am happy with. But at (1,1) I get the value 2. Help! cos 2 pi is 1 so 1**2 - 10*1 is 9 and so the sum is -18 and add 2*10 to it to get 2
[22:35:38] <lesshaste> what am I doing wrong?

[22:41:03] <lesshaste> oh!
[22:41:05] <lesshaste> thank you
[22:41:22] <lesshaste> I read that as maximum over and again

[22:55:46] <isekaijin> Notice that the Rastrigin function can be written as http://mathb.in/71363
[22:55:53] <isekaijin> Which is obviously nonnegative.

[22:56:04] <isekaijin> So, if the value 0 is attained, then it's a global minimum.
[22:56:21] <isekaijin> (Errr, I'm assuming that A >= 0.)

[23:21:22] <enthdegree> is the collection of concrete boolean algebras over a finite set X itself a boolean algebra under join and meet?
[23:21:29] *** Joins: andreasbuhr (~quassel@p548dd8d5.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[23:22:24] <enthdegree> i.e. do the join and meet of several "concrete boolean algebras over a finite set" themselves satisfy the boolean algebra laws

[23:25:28] <enthdegree> maybe less confusingly consider all the sigma algebras you could define over a finite-sized Omega in a probability space
[23:25:42] *** Quits: wakeup (~wakeup@user/wakeup) (Client Quit)
[23:25:50] <enthdegree> the join of sigma algebras and the meet of sigma algebras can both be defined
[23:26:24] <enthdegree> so is this space of recombined signa algebras itself a Boolean algebra?
