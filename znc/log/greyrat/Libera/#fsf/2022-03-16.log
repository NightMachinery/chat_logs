[09:38:44] <qrpnxz> if i can make a mistake in the code, surely i can make a mistake in the proof lol. Point of safety in rust is the compiler doing complex analysis for me on a CPU that can do billion ops per second, rather than i doing it by hand

[09:39:40] <qrpnxz> what's the point of that statement is my question.
[09:39:56] <DiffieHellman> Rust really isn't that reliable. It relies on LLVM, which is an extremely complicated sepples program that is bound to output incorrect assembly.
[09:40:17] <lo> DiffieHellman: why is it bound to output incorrect assembly?
[09:40:47] <DiffieHellman> Insane complexety --> Non zero chance that that it'll output incorrect assembly.
[09:41:05] <lo> that is very vague
[09:41:57] <DiffieHellman> It's actually feasible to do mathematical proofs on a C compiler, proving that incorrect output won't be output. Good luck doing that on LLVM.
[09:42:04] <lo> is the GNU project working on theorem prover? is there any free theorem prover that can be used to generate C code?
[09:42:29] <DiffieHellman> SeL4 seemingly uses a free software theorem prover.

[16:39:08] <Andrew> Apparantly if you send the new TICKLE command over the HTTP API (I use a haxclient) it shows something like "Andrew tickled NICK"
[16:39:12] <vitali64> Andrew: 100$ for an android

[16:39:29] <Andrew> vitali64: I'm a middle school student, mind you

[16:43:49] <belgin> Andrew, it's impressive that you even know about free software. Back in 8th grade all i knew was how to skip school and riding my skateboard :D

[19:57:10] <yrk> fossdev2: you've been asking these questions day after day after day. maybe you should be drawing a conclusion from that. maybe what you are proposing is actually much more complicated than putting a GPLv3 header on the software and just releasing it.
[19:58:56] <yrk> fossdev2: if you are looking to avoid complexity, perhaps the fact that you can't seem to figure out the PD situation is a strong indication that you are going down the complex path instead of the simple one
[19:59:28] <qrpnxz> fossdev2: i think PD, but either way you can treat it the same. CC0 lax license has no requirement afaik. It acts as if it were public domain as much as the law allows

[20:06:16] <yrk> "Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country."

[20:27:06] <qrpnxz> you can do truly whatever you want with PD work, there's not even a question. It's simply free
[20:27:39] <qrpnxz> copyright wise anyway. There's still patents and trademarks.
[20:28:59] <yrk> fossdev2: anyone can take your PD or CC0 work and include it into a large work licensed under the GPL (or a proprietary work, unfortunately). sometimes it will be possible to identify your work from within the larger work and take it back out, but other times it will not
[20:29:26] <yrk> fossdev2: if someone takes your work under PD and significantly modifies it in a proprietary work, then it is gone forever

[21:00:34] <fossdev2> if that's the case then we should not use those because their goal is clear i.e. to help non free software
