[01:19:40] <geirha> it's to pass a literal CR to sed instead of backslash r. Literal CR is defined, backslash r is not

[02:11:14] <rtn0> 1 other q
[02:11:35] <rtn0> if i do \ in bash it's a "literal" symbol
[02:11:53] <rtn0> to tell bash that i want to include the very next ascii char as literally whatever is there...
[02:12:25] <rtn0> so mv this\ file\ has\ space.txt here\ would work.

[02:15:08] <emanuele6> try writing: echo *

[02:17:41] <emanuele6> you need to press C-x and then press *

[02:18:02] <emanuele6> phogg: depends on the keyboard layout :P

[02:18:14] <emanuele6> it's shift+plus for me
[02:18:26] <rtn0> so type echo *, then put my blinking underscroe cursor below the * symbol, then hit ctrl+x, followed by shift+8 ???
[02:18:36] <phogg> rtn0: keep your cursor after the *
[02:18:43] <emanuele6> yeah, after
[02:18:49] <rtn0> immediately after it. ok, got it. jas...
[02:18:55] <phogg> and, as emanuele6 notes, it is only shift 8 on a typical US keyboard layout

[02:19:36] <emanuele6> it is very cool, but it only works with regular patterns, not with extglob patterns unfortunately
[02:19:47] <rtn0> so that list of files which suddenly appeared on my bash input line (but was not actually run), is exactly what bash would send to a program as an "argument"

[20:15:25] <ash_worksi> also, wouldn't the trap remove the file if a second process attepted to run that code but failed because of the lock thereby allowing a 3rd process to run uninhibited?
[20:16:23] <Soliton> the else case does not set a trap.

[20:16:56] <ash_worksi> oh right
[20:17:12] <ash_worksi> so what about the first thing I said?
[20:17:46] <Soliton> the trap is there to remove the lock, yes.
[20:17:56] <ash_worksi> so is that 4th line unnecessary?
[20:18:20] <Soliton> depends what else is coming.
[20:18:50] <ash_worksi> I see
[20:19:12] <Soliton> if you want to lock the whole script, sure.
[20:19:43] <Soliton> in bash just the EXIT trap should be enough anyway.

[20:20:50] <ash_worksi> I figured as much; the other two are short for SIGINT and SIGTERM ?
[20:21:10] <ash_worksi> or is that how you write them?
[20:21:32] <Soliton> you can prepend SIG in bash if you like.
[20:21:55] <ash_worksi> I see, thanks

[23:07:15] <twkm> might not even exist on a loinoid, though generally it will.
[23:07:42] <znf> actually I realize I need to figure out the exact Cores count of a single CPU, not both
[23:07:44] <greycat> GNU coreutils on Linux should have nproc(1)
[23:07:49] <twkm> but as greycat said, a channel related to the o/s should know.

[23:46:55] <cryptonector> when I use rbash to run a script, I don't see it
[23:47:11] <greycat> why-in-the-fuck would you use rbash in a script
[23:47:26] <cryptonector> what I'm trying to do: in a shell function library not warn about the absence of some command

[23:47:57] <cryptonector> ah, $-
[23:48:11] <e36freak> When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see COMMAND EXECUTION above), rbash turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.
[23:48:25] <e36freak> may be slightly relevant
[23:48:31] <cryptonector> nope, still
[23:48:52] <cryptonector> e36freak: oh
[23:49:12] <cryptonector> so there's no way to run rbash as a script interpreter?
[23:50:03] <cryptonector> no, that's not it
[23:50:40] <cryptonector> "When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see COMMAND EXECUTION above), rbash turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script."  -- I took this to mean that when rbash executes an external program found in $PATH, all bets are off

[23:57:01] <cryptonector> notice that *restricted_shell* does not appear in $BASHOPTS and 'r' does not appear in $-
[23:57:12] <cryptonector> oh, sorry, r does
[23:59:00] <cryptonector> unfortunately, 'r' does not appear in $- while rbash runs the $BASH_ENV
[23:59:16] <cryptonector> I was hoping I could detect the use of rbash in $BASH_ENV
[23:59:33] <cryptonector> and $SHELL is bash
