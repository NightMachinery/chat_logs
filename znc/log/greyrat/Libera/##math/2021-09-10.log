[08:32:25] <qergle> then your PE ratio is P/E-bar (with E-bar calculated two different ways)

[14:50:49] <CuriousErnestBro> At time n, I mean
[14:51:38] <CuriousErnestBro> Ok, so here's my approach, there's this theorem where if you can show that X_n+1 = f(X_n, e_n) with X_n independent of e_n, then the process is Markov

[14:54:34] <CuriousErnestBro> And the process (Z_n) is constructed in 2 steps, first append Y_n amount of Geom(θ) variables to the vector, then subtract everything by 1
[14:55:02] <CuriousErnestBro> well actually in the indicator function you'd need Z_n_i = 0 then I suppose.
[14:56:08] <CuriousErnestBro> Anyways, letting e_n =  Y_n - ∑1_{Z_n_i = 1), it's obvious (is it though?) that X_n is independent to that, so the process (X_n) is a Markov chain

[14:57:28] <FrostKiwi> Hey there :] I have a question of basic understanding: I have an array with normally distributed data and I would like to get the gaussion normal distribution out of it. In my Image Software, I can fit that gaussion curve and get my answer. However, I wonder, am I doing it right? Is curve-fitting the only answer to getting a normal distrubtion from a 1-Dimensional array? Is there like some statistical method thingy that get's me the
[14:57:28] <FrostKiwi> normal distribution without the proccess of curve fitting?
[14:59:28] <CuriousErnestBro> FrostKiwi you can compute the sample mean and standard deviation (and construct confidence intervals if you want)
[15:00:10] *** Joins: a_train[m] (~austintra@2001:470:69fc:105::da5e)
[15:00:12] <cherim> It depends on how the curve looks in the known interval
[15:00:34] <CuriousErnestBro> FrostKiwi the normal distribution is fully characterized by its mean and variance
[15:00:46] <cherim> If the maximum is clearly inside and everything decays safely to 0 at  the ends, then mean and variance are very robust
[15:01:15] <cherim> If it's some small piece cut out of the gaussian, then they won't help and fitting may be needed
[15:01:45] <FrostKiwi> CuriousErnestBro: So there is an "analytical" way to do that. My 1-D array is a stripe out of an image of a heap of salt. The maximum is inside and the ends decay to 0. So I don't need any curve fitting, I can look up how to compute the variance and sample mean and I have my answer?
[15:02:05] <cherim> Yes
[15:02:24] <a_train[m]> what is the geometrical meaning of the angle between a zero-vector and some other vector? They are by definition orthogonal (which currently just is a pure mathematical definition and a word to me with yet no deeper meaning). A zero-vector to me is intuitively basically just a point in the origin.
[15:02:27] <cherim> It will even be more stable with respexct to errors in input than fitting
[15:03:04] <FrostKiwi> The Image array is 2048 pixels wide, but basically it looks like this: [0, 12, 54, 245, 255, 245, 54, 12, 0]. cherim, CuriousErnestBro: Thanks for clarifying that. I always felt, that using graphical curve fitting was not the right tool.

[15:32:50] <FrostKiwi> cherim: No. So that is what normalization is in this context. All pixel values summed up is 54170. So 19597957 / 54170 = 361.7862

For the variance you said "D=sum_x p[x] (x-X)^2". How do I read that? I did x minus samplemean, squared that, summed it up and got 30,352,754. From here on out I did a lot of things, none of which seem correct. https://i.imgur.com/GUEuxmo.png  As I understand it should now be

[19:06:00] <[-_-]> hey that is actually intuitive
[19:06:11] <[-_-]> but there is something else
[19:06:26] <[-_-]> minimum value is 0 and maximum value is -1
[19:08:38] <Z-module> [-_-]: of course. If min f(x) is m, for x in [a,b], and max f(x) is M, for x in [a,b] then   m <= f(x) <= M   for all those x, so if  a <= m,  M <= b,  clearly f sends [a,b] into [a,b].  This part doesn't even need f to be continuous.

[19:10:23] <mh_le> hey Z-module
[19:12:07] <Z-module> [-_-]:  the max is 0, the min is -1/3, in that problem you linked to.   -1/3 < 0
[19:12:23] <Z-module> this is about the *values*, not the x where they occur
[19:12:34] <[-_-]> oh....damn
[19:12:43] <mh_le> Z-module: can you recommend a good book on homotopy theory?
[19:12:47] <[-_-]> I am totally not in the mood for math today
[19:13:06] <Z-module> their point here is merely that the image f([-1,1]) is a subset of [-1/3, 0]   so f sends the domain into itself
[19:13:19] <Z-module> since  [-1/3, 0] \subset [-1, 1]

[19:14:24] <mh_le> thanks, I'll look into it, how about K-Theory?
[19:15:02] <Z-module> [-_-]: without knowing f is continuous, they do have f([-1,1]) \subset [-1/3, 0].  By also knowing f is continuous, the image is actually all of [-1/3, 0]

[22:48:05] <somiaj> but any vector field over R works, since real numbers and complex numbers can also be viewed as vector fields over R (so can functions)
[22:48:20] <somiaj> so your three examples are really all the same thing, vector fields over R
[22:49:30] <cuppajoeman> Oh ok, I also kept looking and I found field, is that more relaxed?
[22:49:44] <somiaj> field would be more limted
[22:50:12] <somiaj> by more relaxed, I was thinking you could still define that function without say addition bing commulitive, or various things like that
[22:50:41] <somiaj> or maybe you are only in a ring, but in general I think vector field is a good place to be at, and not worry about what happens if you relax some of the axioms
[22:51:05] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: arg, I'm using bad termonology, it is 'vector space', not 'vector field' -- that is something different
[22:51:14] <cuppajoeman> Ok, I'll start with vector space
[22:51:21] <cuppajoeman> thank you!

[22:56:21] <somiaj> correct, because only addition is defined in R^3

[23:05:36] <greenbagels> cuppajoeman: btw one thing you might find in the wild is the concept of "straight line homotopy"
[23:05:46] <greenbagels> which is basically what you wrote as teh linear interpolation function
[23:05:51] <greenbagels> but replace x,y with f(x), g(x)
[23:06:03] <greenbagels> so like a "linear interpolation function" between other functions
[23:06:07] <cuppajoeman> woah
[23:06:15] <cuppajoeman> that's cool
[23:06:16] <greenbagels> so in case you find this while looking online, its basically the same thing, but for functions

[23:07:01] <greenbagels> you can imagine it like a straight line interpolant along corresponding points on graphs of 2 functions
[23:07:17] <somiaj> though here functions can be viewed as vectors over the real numbers, so just another case of which vector space V you use
[23:07:32] <greenbagels> yeah its really the same thing as what somiaj was saying
[23:07:35] <greenbagels> just another specific case
[23:07:56] <somiaj> hence why the vector space is a very nice general object to use for this

[23:11:46] <p-i-_> I started imagining potential ways to discard points without brute-force testing
[23:11:57] <int-e> p-i-_: even the 2D version doesn't look pretty
[23:12:07] <greenbagels> cuppajoeman: right? :)
[23:12:53] <p-i-_> I thought about bounding hypercubes/hypersphers and finding the axis that maximizes distance
[23:13:35] <int-e> p-i-_: (though in 2D you can discard points inside the convex hull; that's not attractive in 128 dimensions)
[23:14:04] <greenbagels> is this one of those problems where once you go to 3D and beyond the same issues cause problems
[23:14:24] <cuppajoeman> I want to make a bijection between (-pi/2, pi/2) to [0,1]. In general I have an idea about how I can make a bijection between two open sets like (a,b) <-> (c,d), but I'm not too sure how to proceed for (a,b) <-> [c,d] like in this example.
[23:14:36] <p-i-_> I imagined a scenario of 3 galaxies where you can bound-sphere around each. Big separation between galaxies. So only triangles with one point in each would be valid.

[23:15:16] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: it cannot be continous, so you have to be careful
[23:15:17] <p-i-_> I also thought of some algo that would try to find a big triangle, maybe by repeatedly changing one point until it makes the area bigger.
[23:15:25] <p-i-_> And moving onto the next one. etc.
[23:15:45] <greenbagels> cuppajoeman: try breaking it up into multiple steps and using compositions of bijections
[23:15:54] <p-i-_> With a big triangle, maybe some points could be rejected outright as they couldn't contribute to a bigger one.

[23:16:15] <cuppajoeman> somiaj, I am using the linear interpolation function for the case of (a,b) <-> (c,d) but I'm not sure if I can use this in the new case with the closed end points
[23:16:17] *** Joins: fstd (~fstd@xdsl-87-79-158-186.nc.de)
[23:16:29] <greenbagels> cuppajoeman: you can't, because that function is continuous
[23:16:32] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: yea, that would be continous, but your bijection cannot be continous
[23:16:36] <cuppajoeman> oh ok
[23:16:40] <int-e> Okay, the 2D case is actually easy... compute the convex hull, then walk around it once to find the maximum (keeping track of two vectors about 90 degrees apart as viewed from A)
[23:16:41] <cuppajoeman> so new idea altogether?
[23:16:55] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: now one example [a,b] -> (c,d) is use that linear function (almost)
[23:17:09] <p-i-_> int-e: Yes, nice. traction.
[23:17:12] <int-e> (that description is very sketchy, but it will work out)
[23:17:24] <p-i-_> yeah I get it. It's low complexity.
[23:17:49] <p-i-_> So a 3D space will have a convex hull of planes.
[23:17:52] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so let l: [a,b] -> [c,d] be your linear function, now to make a bijection from [a,b] -> (c,d) we need to be a little tricy
[23:17:54] <int-e> But the additional dimensions will really hurt.
[23:17:56] <p-i-_> 3D point-cloud
[23:18:20] <cuppajoeman> we need a place to map a and b
[23:18:29] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so send a -> f(a/2), f^(-1)(a/2) - > f(a/4), f^(-1)(a/4) -> f(a/8), .... and so on
[23:18:45] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: arg, let me fix this
[23:19:55] <p-i-_> I think dot-product formulation of triangle area could be vectorized so the problem can be expressed in matrix operations.
[23:20:35] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: I was thinking [0,1], let h = b-a, then send a -> f(a + h/2), f^-1(a + h/2) -> f(a + h/4), and so on (so what I'm doing is basically taking a set of points 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, .... out of the function and sending them to the next one in the list, dealing with the end point, do a similar thing to b, and this will now get a bijection from [a,b] -> (c,d) -- that make sense or am I making it too
[23:20:36] <p-i-_> Interesting huh? Such a simply formulated problem. But somehow elusive.
[23:20:41] <somiaj> confusing?

[23:22:31] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: here is simplier example, [0,1] -> [0,1), the bijection is x->x if x != 1/2^n, otherwise 1/2^n -> 1/2^(n+1) (1->1/2, 1/2 -> 1/4, 1/4 -> 1/8, ... ) and so on

[23:22:56] <somiaj> nice thing about bijections is you can define them either direction
[23:23:01] <cuppajoeman> right
[23:23:37] <somiaj> basically you just remove a countable number of points from the linear function, and then send x_n -> x_n+1 in that countable infinite list, to deal with the end point
