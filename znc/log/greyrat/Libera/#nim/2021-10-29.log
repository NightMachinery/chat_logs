[01:56:25] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> I guess it can't find `gcc.exe`
[01:58:26] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> does `gcc.exe --version` work?
[01:58:52] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> no
[01:59:06] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> But nim v1.4.8 worked.  I'm just trying to `nim c script.nim`
[02:00:33] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Ddw
[02:03:40] <nixfreak_nim[m]> whats a good library to parse columns and rows and to manipulate them ? 
[02:05:39] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> How about to set path env var temporary like `set path=c:\full\path\to\gcc;%path%` and see if nim call gcc.
[02:16:24] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> In reply to @demotomohiro "How about to set": hmmm, seems that `dist/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe` is in my nim v1.4.8 folder but not for v1.6.0.  Guessing I downloaded it manually when I installed v1.4.8 and forgot about that step or something?  But for some reason v1.6.0 still can't find it..
[02:17:42] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> (edit) "it.." => "it when I copy it to the `dist` folder for v1.6.0"

[02:25:12] <nixfreak_nim[m]> I want to take an exported file which has columns and rows but if you try to import into a spreadsheet the  columns are messed up, I would like to convert the exported file to a suitable csv file. Some rows are not together so it makes it really hard to print out say with awk 
[02:26:06] <nixfreak_nim[m]> Can I use parsecsv to manipulate the data to turn into a useable csv file? 
[02:29:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> What's on those rows not together? empty lines?
[02:29:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Do you really need to be CSV aware is basically my question

[02:37:24] <nixfreak_nim[m]> like this , but the rows will change depending on the access 
[02:37:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah so it's a horizontal issue
[02:37:49] <nixfreak_nim[m]> yes 
[02:38:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I guess the solution is to find the largest word in each column and pad the result to that size
[02:39:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So sadly a 2 step process
[02:41:03] <nixfreak_nim[m]> so the read the file line by line and search for largest word and pad the result

[03:15:14] <nixfreak_nim[m]> Ok thanks, so in this program you would still have to input what you want to see or was that just an example 
[03:19:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> your input can be a filestream
[03:19:34] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So you can do `yourInput = openFileStream("someFile.csv")` and it should work, though the `csv` open will not respect you seperator
[03:23:50] <nixfreak_nim[m]> ok interesting 
[03:24:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You can also make the output a stream to
[03:24:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Even your stdout 😀
[03:25:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> just do `newFileStream(stdout)` and that example will write right to your stdout
[03:26:08] <nixfreak_nim[m]> ok , thank you very much 
[03:26:58] <nixfreak_nim[m]> Did something change with opening a file with nim ? I thought you could always just open using openFile("file.txt")
[03:28:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> you can
[03:28:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> fileStreams are not files
[03:57:03] <tk> Why does from std/enumerate import enumerate not work?
[03:57:18] <tk> using the enumerate macro results in: Error: undeclared identifier: 'enumerate'
[03:57:27] <tk> simply replacing the line with "import std/enumerate" fixes the issue
[03:58:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It might be a product of module name == symname or the for loop macro
[03:58:35] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Eitherway it literally has a single macro in it 😛
[03:59:14] <tk> I am aware, but confusing language behaviour does not make me happy. Which is why I want to understand exactly what happened.
[03:59:56] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well give it a whirl with another macro with the same name as the module if that works make it a for loop macro, if that works the end is upon us

[06:18:49] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> is it possible to assign a returned `var T` to a variable? https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Dek after I assign increment `bar`, I expect `val` to be 2, but it's 1.
[06:20:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Without experimental views nope, but you can use `std/decls` to get it as long as you know it doesnt escape
[06:20:59] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> Strangely, things kinda work with var return type for iterators
[06:21:39] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> Hey beef, would you mind taking a look at this? https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Dem

[06:22:51] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> They work separately, but not when the type is or'ed.  And I don't understand why.
[06:23:28] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> does using `ptr` change anything
[06:24:04] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> well I have two `mitems` in the sample
[06:24:13] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> one takes `ptr T`
[06:24:46] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Well you're using ptr math so this makes it more annoying to test

[06:25:32] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> those work for sure
[06:25:44] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> that's cause it fits both definitions
[06:25:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's a `ptr T` and an `var UncheckedArray`
[06:26:57] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> oh you're saying `var UncheckedArray[T] | ptr T` is redudant?
[06:28:29] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> if I uncomment `iterator mitems[T](a: var UncheckedArray[T] | ptr T, len: SomeInteger): var T =` and comment out the ones above I get an error: `expression has no address`
[06:28:48] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> on the `yield a[i]`
[06:29:35] <FromDiscord> <geekrelief> It doesn't like the UncheckedArray but if pass the ptr T for `var UncheckedArray[T] | ptr T` it works

[07:04:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `setLabel` would be a macro which would add it to a list which you could refer to later, you could either do `setLocale` or include a locale flag into the macro

[10:48:22] <Amun-Ra> safe*
[11:48:00] <PMunch> Hmm, I have a weird bug. Something causes a segfault in a shared library I've written in Nim. It only happens in our production environment and I'm not even 100% sure it is caused by my code. I tried to build a debug version of Nim but that just yielded the line "No stack trace available" before the segfault message. What would be my best steps to further debug this issue..
[11:48:05] <PMunch> s/../?
[11:54:38] <FromDiscord> <leorize> if you can get it to segfault on nim \>= 1.6.0, it should create a coredump that you can use to investigate
[11:56:40] <PMunch> Oh really?
[11:56:47] <PMunch> Where does it store that?
[11:57:35] <FromDiscord> <Imperatorn> What OS?
[11:58:02] <PMunch> Ubuntu in a Docker container
[11:58:22] <FromDiscord> <leorize> is this a bug with that unbound plugin you wrote a while back?
[11:58:35] <PMunch> Yup
[11:58:44] <PMunch> It's been running in production ever since I wrote it

[12:01:03] <PMunch> Yeah it works pretty well and has been fairly problem free
[12:01:30] <FromDiscord> <leorize> also, make sure that your nim library\: does not use dlopen via dynlib and is compiled with nim \>= 1.4.0
[12:03:17] <FromDiscord> <leorize> make sure that you don't deallocate any memory coming from unbound using Nim's `dealloc`
[12:03:28] <FromDiscord> <leorize> or send any  Nim's memory to `unbound`, for that matter
[12:03:50] <PMunch> Yeah I've taken all the normal steps
[12:03:56] <FromDiscord> <leorize> `-d:noSignalHandler` might come in handy to not overrides unbound's signal handlers by accident
[12:04:24] <PMunch> I mean I was running it on my machine just blasting it with queries and I wasn't able to crash it
[12:04:38] <PMunch> So there is some edge-case scenario when hit with the real world
[12:05:33] <FromDiscord> <leorize> run it with coredump enabled and hope that you can catch it then
[12:06:27] <PMunch> Starting with 1.6.0 I get a lot of CStringConv warnings by the way
[12:07:07] <PMunch> I had a version that didn't crash before, but it had some performance issues. Slight refactor and update the versions of different things and now it crashes sometimes
[12:07:37] <FromDiscord> <leorize> just remember to replace the convs with addr I guess
[12:07:47] <FromDiscord> <leorize> hmm, it wasn't mentioned on 1.6.0 release note at all
[12:07:57] <PMunch> Hmm, what do you mean?
[12:08:54] <FromDiscord> <leorize> to silence those warnings, that is
[12:09:13] <FromDiscord> <leorize> I think now `addr` must be used to signify those conversions since they are dangerous
[12:09:18] <FromDiscord> <leorize> (rightfully so)
[12:14:05] <PMunch> I use it to convert C library error strings into Nim strings

[14:01:49] <FromDiscord> <Arend | ᛗᛟᚢᚱᛁᛖᛊ> just that I didnt like try/catch blocks as error handling and preferred something like Zig

[14:03:12] <PMunch> How does Zig handle errors by the way?
[14:03:25] <PMunch> Some kind of optional return system?
[14:04:26] <FromDiscord> <Arend | ᛗᛟᚢᚱᛁᛖᛊ> well, they switch over errors rather than try blocks, makes it look less cluttered
[14:05:53] <PMunch> So you get something like a (error: Option[Defect], result: Option[T]) as a return?
[14:08:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> You can do it already to an extent - disable all raises, and use Result or leorize union
[14:08:23] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> And switch over errors
[14:08:54] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I need to try out union, certainly worth adding somewhere in the code

[14:46:40] <PMunch> Huh union looks pretty neat
[14:51:57] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I think it would also be possible to wrap procedure call into union automatically - check for possible exceptions with `std/effecttraits`, generate `try/except` and make it return `union(Ok | Error1 | Error2 | Error3)` etc)
[14:56:45] <PMunch> Ooh, that would probably be possible
[14:57:07] <PMunch> A simple pragma that took all the possible exceptions and instead returned a union with the original return type and all the exceptions

[15:07:41] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you mean `for a in MyObject` calls `items()`?

[15:08:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `/hm+/`
[15:08:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you can define `iterator items(arg: SomeType)` and it will be called in the `for a in <expr of SomeType>` implicitly
[15:09:08] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `for a` calls `items()`, `for a, b` calls `pairs()`

[17:09:59] <PMunch> Depends on how your file manager passes files to programs
[17:10:12] <FromDiscord> <galen> In reply to @PMunch "Depends on how your": its on windows only
[17:11:02] <PMunch> Probably it is some kind of parameter passing, so need paramCount and paramStr to find the name of the file
[17:12:16] <FromDiscord> <galen> Thank you! Will start there 🙂
[17:13:45] <PMunch> At least that's the way it'd be done on Linux. But since it's Windows it might be a five word system call to get a wide string with BOM markers or something equally silly

[18:07:28] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> When the bot is deployed, and user uses the command `/copy` it should tell the user to fill `s1` varitable then after user filled it it will ask to fill the variatble `d1` . After user filled all variatbles it will execute the command which is specified in python code by `proc` variatble.
[18:07:51] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> ok so only the value is not known at compile time.

[18:08:23] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> ok then you can go with strformat
[18:08:59] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> about filling the variatbles the discord bot will ask to do that in discord itself

[18:11:19] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> and this you will get as a string?
[18:11:57] <FromDiscord> <Illusive> It will get the string and then pass it to the `proc` variatble which has the specified command
[18:13:02] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> yes so then you must tokenize and parse the string that discord gives you and fill the desired variables and call you run process code

[18:53:53] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i guess its cool
[18:53:55] <FromDiscord> <tandy> i dont think u can do padded arrays in nim
[18:54:05] <FromDiscord> <tandy> so il try make this work for my checkers game
[18:54:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> wdym?
[18:54:45] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you can align types in nim
[18:56:16] <FromDiscord> <tandy> huh how

[19:03:52] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hoy doods is there a version of strutils find that is case insensitive
[19:04:00] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ?
[19:04:03] <FromDiscord> <Rika> example
[19:05:02] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> From the manual: "Searching is case-sensitive. If sub is not in s, -1 is returned. Otherwise the index returned is relative to s[0], not start. Use s[start..last].find for a start-origin index."
[19:07:16] <FromDiscord> <Rika> no
[19:07:26] <FromDiscord> <Rika> convert everything to lowercase then search is the easy way out
[19:08:36] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> wot
[19:08:57] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> is this the official way people do things when searching for case insensitive stuff?
[19:09:01] <FromDiscord> <Rika> no
[19:09:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i said its the easy way not the common way
[19:09:15] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> there is no "official way people do things when searching for case insensitive stuff"
[19:09:19] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> what is the common way :3
[19:09:24] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i dont know
[19:09:52] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> Rika sometimes I love you but sometimes I love you a bit less
[19:10:01] <FromDiscord> <Rika> thanks, i dont care
[19:10:04] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `let start = sentence.toLowerAscii().find("word".toLowerAscii()); sentence[start .. <something>]`
[19:10:16] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> done
[19:10:38] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> hmm
[19:10:40] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> well, I haven't compiled it, but anyway there is no "official" way for writing 1-2 lines of code
[19:10:44] <FromDiscord> <Rika> (if you still need a disclaimer, i am joking)
[19:10:46] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> ok I'll try lowering the cases
[19:14:38] <nixfreak_nim[m]> Ok I figured it out , you can't use single quotes , you have to use double quotes for echo " " 
[19:15:10] <nixfreak_nim[m]> but still doesn't make sense why it worked on playground and not emacs and nvim 
[19:15:50] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> how it worked on playground?
[19:15:58] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `echo ' '` is valid though
[19:15:58] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Maybe a different nim version? ↵echo a char should work afaik
[19:16:17] <nixfreak_nim[m]> I used both versions 1.4.8 and 1.6.0 
[19:16:44] <FromDiscord> <Rika> can you send the playground link or have you sent it before
[19:16:47] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> What you mean not emacs and nim?
[19:16:58] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Nvim
[19:17:06] <nixfreak_nim[m]> neovim and Emacs 
[19:17:11] <nixfreak_nim[m]> I used both IDE
[19:17:43] <nixfreak_nim[m]> * both IDE's to and used emcas plugin to compile
[19:18:45] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Yes, so it does not compile when you write this code in emacs or nvim?
[19:19:10] <nixfreak_nim[m]> it errors out yes , unless I change the single quotes or double 
[19:19:15] <nixfreak_nim[m]> s/or/to/
[19:19:31] <nixfreak_nim[m]> brb need to update element
[19:19:44] <FromDiscord> <Rika> is whats inside the quotes one character or more
[19:19:51] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> what is the error
[19:19:59] <FromDiscord> <Rika> the whole error
[19:25:17] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> yea rika it works, also the python dudes do the same
[19:25:25] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> so we can say now it's the official way
[19:26:29] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> No this will be totally unperformant
[19:26:38] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> For larger datasets
[19:26:48] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> they have the prettier lower instead of the toLowerAscii monstrosity tho
[19:27:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> you need to do what exactly? Find word in a sentence in case-insensetive way?
[19:27:24] <nixfreak_nim[m]> Since deleting the whole line I can't recreate it, sorry. There must of been something there I couldn't see 
[19:27:25] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I have a dataset and I want to search a column for substrings
[19:27:56] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> And how bis is the dataset?
[19:28:08] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> absolutely tiny lol
[19:28:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I wanted to suggest just copying `find` from stdlib and then replacing `str[idx] == word[idx2]` with case-insensetive compare
[19:28:16] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Big
[19:28:19] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> but then I looked into implementaiton of find
[19:28:42] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and holy shit I do not recommend to even look at it
[19:28:55] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Then it's fine I guess 😁↵(@hmmm)
[19:28:56] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> what in the world is `hasCStringBuiltin` even
[19:29:55] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> I trust our find is on par with python find or I will personally call the manager and they will hear me

[19:42:59] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> the reason would be they like aesthetics and we like monsters and vampires?
[19:47:29] <FromDiscord> <Rika> no, its more explicit that it doesnt handle unicode (obviously) and that it is not inplace

[22:44:45] <FromDiscord> <Rika> its in the name

[23:58:03] <FromDiscord> <Imperatorn> I'm not really. It's just a general question. Why would an unspecified individual choose Nim over Rust in general
