[02:32:41] <Guest48> hi, is 2-pass VP9 encoding currently broken in ffmpeg? (libvpx-vp9, windows)
[02:32:49] <Guest48> I've tried everything I can and it doesn't seem to work
[02:32:58] <furq> not to my knowledge
[02:33:00] <furq> what's the error
[02:33:40] <Guest48> even if I use the simplest possible command, pass 1 outputs an empty ffmpeg2pass-0.log, and then pass 2 complains about "rc_twopass_stats_in.buf" not being set
[02:34:21] <Guest48> I've tried many different input videos and running the command in different folders (in case its an access/admin thing), but to no avail
[02:35:28] <Guest48> I was on a version of ffmpeg a few months old when I tried first and got this error, which prompted me to update to the latest build, but it still happens
[02:37:59] <Guest48> wait, for the first time I've managed to get it to output something to the log
[02:38:42] <Guest48> this was the command:   ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -an -pass 1 -f null NUL
[02:39:15] <Guest48> so there must be something about one of the basic libvpx-vp9 parameters it doesn't like
[02:41:30] <Guest48> for the sake of testing, this is the command I've been using:    ffmpeg -i "input.mp4" -an -c:v libvpx-vp9 -quality realtime -cpu-used 8 -threads 8 -tile-columns 6 -frame-parallel 1 -pass 1 -f null NUL
[02:41:45] <Guest48> which is all standard fare, so I don't see why any of that would break the first pass stats log
[02:44:51] <Guest48> that much already doesn't work, but adding '-crf 30 -b:v 0' doesn't change anything
[02:46:19] <Guest48> for the record, this is the full error: "Failed to initialize encoder: Invalid parameter" and then "Additional information: rc_twopass_stats_in.buf not set."
[02:46:32] <furq> all of that multithreading stuff is obsolete now
[02:46:41] <furq> just -row_mt 1 -threads 8
[02:46:59] <furq> idk if that would break it though, i don't think they removed the old mt stuff
[02:47:20] <furq> maybe two-pass doesn't work with -deadline realtime
[02:47:24] <Guest48> I would be surprised; I've been using those commands for years now without problems (not 2-pass though)
[02:47:43] <Guest48> I changed 'deadline' to 'quality' just because ffmpeg -h encoder=libvpx-vp9 uses that terminology now
[02:48:22] <Guest48> bingo
[02:48:27] <furq> yeah that's a weird combination
[02:49:05] <Guest48> your version of the multithread stuff ran stupidly faster and output a log file :P
[02:49:16] <furq> the old multithreading code was awful
[02:49:23] <furq> the new one still isn't great but it's much better
[02:49:31] <Guest48> I guess libvpx doesn't like some of that old MT stuff but quietly spits in your meal instead of throwing an error?
[02:49:41] <furq> could be
[02:50:33] <Guest48> yay, the log has contents and pass 2 completes successfully -- thanks!
[02:51:10] <Guest48> so hard tracking down all the minutia of these obscure codec-specific parameters sometimes...

[17:12:53] <Anubis169> quick query, are there any ffmpeg plugins or projects that can reconstruct a frame from those either side of it?

[17:17:06] <BtbN> Are you looking for the minterpolate filter?
[17:17:44] <Anubis169> so during this vhs capture, if the signal drops out, i get a black 720x576 frame in the video
[17:17:54] <Anubis169> but the frames either side of that are good
[17:18:46] <Anubis169> i.e. frame 23 (good), frame 24 (black), frame 25 (good)
[17:19:16] <Anubis169> looking for a plugin that'll create what frame 24 might've looked like, by looking at frame 23 and frame 25
[17:19:34] <Anubis169> and replace the black frame 24 with it
[17:20:55] <Anubis169> is that what minterpolate does? :)

[17:22:51] <BtbN> If you got random black frames everywhere, it's not gonna magically fix them

[21:25:55] <BtbN> video encoding is always gonna tax the system no matter what software you use
[21:28:17] <zumba_addict> with OBS, my system becomes laggy
[21:28:58] <zumba_addict> the best I found is SimpleScreenRecorder. I was thinking my cpu from 12 years ago is not good anymore
[21:29:59] <furq> how old is your gpu
[21:30:17] <zumba_addict> my son gave me this card, one sec
[21:30:35] <zumba_addict> it is Radeon RX 460
[21:30:55] <zumba_addict> is that a good card?
[21:31:24] <zumba_addict> this param works, ffmpeg -vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128
[21:32:51] <zumba_addict> btw, I just tried this but the resulting video doesn't play smooth like the original video - ffmpeg -vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128 -hwaccel vaapi -i GOPR1082.MP4.mov -vf 'format=nv12,hwupload' -qp 19 -bf 4 -c:v h264_vaapi -c:a copy test.mp

[21:33:22] <xerox> zumba_addict: did you try changing the encoder settings? there's a lot to play with in obs, from hardware to software encoding, and then multiple ranges of options
[21:33:42] <zumba_addict> xerox, yes, I tried so many encoders with no luck
[21:33:52] <zumba_addict> I can try it again

[21:35:38] <zumba_addict> maybe I haven't tried the hardware encoding yet
[21:35:52] <BtbN> A 12 year old CPU is gonna have serious trouble encoding h264 while doing other stuff
[21:36:05] <zumba_addict> that's what I am thinking too
[21:36:05] <BtbN> And an RX460 doesn't have good hwencoing either
[21:36:17] <zumba_addict> what card would you recommend?
[21:36:43] <BtbN> I'd recommend a more modern CPU, since those you can actually buy
[21:37:01] <zumba_addict> AMD or Intel? Rxzen something?
[21:37:26] <BtbN> Anything really. Just not some low budget 4 core. Then you run into the same issue again.
[21:37:34] *** Joins: irc_user (uid423822@id-423822.lymington.irccloud.com)
[21:37:51] <zumba_addict> cool. I bought it before for like $300, it has 8 core
[21:38:07] <BtbN> Your 12 year old CPU has 8 cores?
[21:38:10] <zumba_addict> it can play 4k without any issues but encoding, it suffers
[21:38:14] <zumba_addict> yes
[21:38:21] <BtbN> I highly doubt that, specially for that price.
[21:38:34] <BtbN> What CPU is it?
[21:38:56] <zumba_addict> cat /proc/cpuinfo says "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         860  @ 2.80GHz"
[21:39:04] <BtbN> That's a quad core.
[21:39:09] <zumba_addict> ah
[21:39:21] <zumba_addict> so multi threaded which is 4x2 right?
[21:39:31] <BtbN> Each core has two hyperthreads, yes.
[21:39:36] <zumba_addict> got it
[21:39:42] <zumba_addict> so it's fake 8 core
[21:39:52] <BtbN> No, it just has 4 cores.
[21:39:58] <zumba_addict> got it
[21:40:12] <zumba_addict> the new cpu i must buy should be physically 8 cores?
[21:40:12] <BtbN> Nothing fake about it, every higher end CPU in the last decade has hyperthreads.
[21:40:30] <BtbN> 8 cores are probably gonna be more than enough and easily obtainable nowadays.
[21:40:38] <zumba_addict> cool
[21:40:59] <BtbN> Just will need a new "everything else" as well, except GPU
[21:41:03] <zumba_addict> i am not sure the quality of amd cpus. I never had issues with this intel. Is amd reliable?
[21:41:11] <zumba_addict> yep, new mobo
[21:41:18] <BtbN> and new RAM
[21:41:20] <BtbN> and likely new PSU
[21:41:24] <zumba_addict> cool
[21:41:50] <BtbN> If you can get your hands on some cheap second hand Nvidia GPU from the 2000 series, their hwenc is fine as well
[21:41:57] <BtbN> but finding one of them is incredibly hard
[21:42:22] <zumba_addict> my son got really lucky on a high end nvidia card for 600 only. His friend works at bestbuy, 50% off
[21:42:33] <zumba_addict> i'll ask the model
[21:47:09] <zumba_addict> looks like my son didn't get a good deal. It's nvidia 3070 TI Finders Edition. He said it's $600 but internet is saying $600
[21:48:29] <zumba_addict> ah no shipping and tax, not bad for a savings of $90
[21:48:41] <furq> that might be the msrp but i don't think you can actually get them for that much right now
[21:48:41] <zumba_addict> I was wrong when I wrote 50% off above
[21:48:48] <zumba_addict> ah
[21:48:57] <zumba_addict> it that a good card though?
[21:49:14] <furq> the cheapest one i see on newegg is $1200
[21:49:28] <zumba_addict> oh wow
[21:49:35] <furq> and yeah that's a very good card
[21:49:42] <furq> gpu prices have gone absolutely crazy in the last few years
[21:50:12] <zumba_addict> xerox, I'm interested  what you wrote earlier, hardware encoding on OBS. What is it called in the dropdown?
[21:50:19] <zumba_addict> gotcha furq
[21:50:21] <xerox> let me see
[21:50:28] <furq> generally if you just want to do hardware encoding you want the cheapest card you can get of a particular generation that can encode
[21:50:37] <furq> since the hwenc asic is usually the same for all cards of the same gen
[21:50:44] <zumba_addict> ah
[21:50:55] <zumba_addict> so 2000 series like BtbN said
[21:51:06] <furq> i think the 1650 has the same chip but don't quote me on that
[21:51:17] <zumba_addict> Nvidia 1650?
[21:51:19] <furq> yeah
[21:51:25] <zumba_addict> we're all talking nvidia right?
[21:51:26] <zumba_addict> cool
[21:51:29] <xerox> in my case I have these options https://i.imgur.com/1nGmtND.png
[21:51:34] <BtbN> Well, anything with a Turing Chip or better. But better than your current card, otherwise it's kinda a waste of money
[21:51:36] <furq> amd's hwenc is a lot worse than nvidia
[21:51:52] <zumba_addict> good info furq
[21:51:57] <furq> also is there a turing card with nvenc that isn't better than an rx 460
[21:51:59] <zumba_addict> xerox I'll check it now. Thank you
[21:52:13] <zumba_addict> got it
[21:52:16] <xerox> I wish I had x265 to try
[21:52:38] <furq> for 4k you probably want something with h265 encode support
[21:52:38] <zumba_addict> xerox, is that in the output and recording tab?
[21:52:43] <furq> but the new nvidia stuff all does
[21:52:54] <xerox> zumba_addict: exactly
[21:53:00] <furq> 4k h264 is not really great
[21:53:22] <xerox> zumba_addict: https://i.imgur.com/z8ONY5t.png
[21:53:29] <zumba_addict> i don't see hardware from the list :(
[21:53:59] <zumba_addict> I only see 1, x264
[21:54:12] <xerox> ):
[21:54:30] <furq> obs has amf support
[21:54:36] <BtbN> The card might not
[21:54:41] <furq> i'm pretty sure it does
[21:54:47] <BtbN> 460 is fairly low end
[21:56:10] <furq> no idea where amd keeps their support list but wikipedia claims it has vce 3.0
[21:56:50] <fkaa> my 470 shows up as "FFMPEG VAAPI" in OBS
[21:56:58] <furq> which is the same one i have here but i don't have a 4k monitor to try capturing
[21:57:50] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)
[21:58:01] <zumba_addict> I'll check AMF
[21:58:34] <zumba_addict> I don't see it from the encoder dropdown
[21:58:59] <furq> what os
[21:59:00] <another|> a dedicated capture card might be an option
[21:59:03] <BtbN> Make sure you're not on ancient driver and/or OBS version
[21:59:10] <BtbN> another|, that makes no sense lol
[21:59:18] <furq> you need amdgpu-pro on linux iirc
[21:59:25] <BtbN> You still gotta encode the video, and now also have to fiddle with a bunch of wires for no reason
[21:59:27] <zumba_addict> it's linux
[21:59:43] <zumba_addict> I think I installed that but let me check
[21:59:48] <furq> actually nvm you can access it through vaapi with the free driver
[22:00:10] <BtbN> OBS might not support anything but Intel via VAAPI
[22:00:17] <BtbN> Their Linux support is all over the place
[22:00:18] <furq> 18:26:50 ( fkaa) my 470 shows up as "FFMPEG VAAPI" in OBS
[22:00:41] <zumba_addict> ah, looks like i don't have pro as shown by dpkg -l
[22:03:44] <zumba_addict> yep, no ffmpeg vaapi in my obs
[22:03:56] <another|> BtbN: err, why? If you can't get a GPU and don't need one just for encoding?
[22:04:00] <zumba_addict> OBS is recent, I installed it last week
[22:04:29] <zumba_addict> i am able to use gpu with ffmpeg in command line
[22:04:37] <another|> AFAIK amdgpu-pro just provides better vulkan support
[22:04:48] <furq> it provides the amf stuff as well
[22:04:51] <zumba_addict> but i think recording a 4k screen, it will still use cpu right?
[22:05:00] <BtbN> another|, a capture card captures video. You still have to encode it... It's entirely unrelated to the problem at hand.
[22:05:02] <furq> but you can access the hwenc stuff through vaapi without it
[22:05:06] <another|> zumba_addict: install date says absolutely nothing about version
[22:05:20] <zumba_addict> k
[22:05:37] <zumba_addict> but am I correct with what I wrote?
[22:05:52] <zumba_addict> I still need a better cpu when recording 4k screen
[22:06:19] <BtbN> Your CPU is _very_ dated, you'll want a new one soonish no matter what.
[22:06:26] <zumba_addict> yep
[22:06:33] <zumba_addict> I am thinking ffmpeg is for post only
[22:06:52] <zumba_addict> encoding is post
[22:07:08] <another|> BtbN: Not sure if we're talking about the same thing. Capture cards nowadays often have an integrated ASIC
[22:07:34] <BtbN> For capturing, yes.
[22:08:04] <BtbN> You can do something mildly ridiculous like grab an old HDD recorder, and split a screen into it. But quality will likely suck, since they often use mpeg2
[22:08:48] <another|> there are models with passthrough. could stick it between GPU and monitor
[22:09:12] <BtbN> AverMedia also has some fully stand-alone capture devices that record to SDCard on the push of a button. But the quality of those cheap hwencs sucks majorly.
[22:09:23] <another|> If CPU update is necessary depends on your use case
[22:09:36] <BtbN> It's basically the same hwenc they put into USB2 webcams that can't fit their "1080p" over USB2 uncompressed
[22:10:21] <another|> I know nothing about their quality. just mentioned that it might be an option
[22:11:02] <BtbN> The vast majority of reputable capture devices just give you raw frames anyway
[22:11:14] <BtbN> The era where they came with a hwenc is over, and they only had it to "work" over USB2
[22:11:58] <BtbN> Ultra low delay became more important, and you can't really do that if you first encode and then decode the video, to then encode it again to stream it.
[22:11:59] <zumba_addict> i'm currently searching for nvidia 2000 series
[22:12:25] <BtbN> It's gonna be hard to find much of anything there, since GPUs are more valuable than their weight in gold right now
[22:12:37] <zumba_addict> got it
[22:14:17] <zumba_addict> btw, why is the resulting video a little laggy when played back? I just found this in github - ffmpeg -vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128 -hwaccel vaapi -i GOPR1082.MP4.mov -vf 'format=nv12,hwupload' -qp 19 -bf 4 -c:v h264_vaapi -c:a copy test.mp4
[22:15:02] <BtbN> Probably because the player can't keep up with it.
[22:15:12] <zumba_addict> i normally use -c:v libx264 -crf 18 without any issues
[22:15:41] <BtbN> A transcode output does not become laggy no matter what. It'll just take longer to complete.
[22:15:55] <BtbN> So if it's laggs during playback, it's something with the player.
[22:16:27] <zumba_addict> i can play GOPR1082.MP4.mov  without any issues using mplayer
[22:16:57] <zumba_addict> but when I play test.mp4, it's laggy or there are skipped frames
[22:17:57] <BtbN> Did it create such an insane bitrate that your disks can't keep up reading it in real time?
[22:18:19] <zumba_addict> oh bit rate, changed from 14k to 23K
[22:18:22] <zumba_addict> yes
[22:18:43] <BtbN> that's not nearly enough to stress a disk
[22:18:59] <zumba_addict> look - https://bpa.st/42ZA
[22:19:58] *** Joins: beaver (~beaver@user/pong)
[22:20:26] <BtbN> You're not gonna push even an old HDD to its limits with 23Mbit/s
[22:20:27] <furq> that's 144mbps to 23mbps
[22:20:47] <furq> but also the source is prores
[22:20:52] <furq> which is specifically very easy to encode
[22:21:17] <furq> and it's more than 1080p so your hwdec might not want to deal with it
[22:21:18] <zumba_addict> not sure why playback is bad when using the hardware encoding
[22:21:29] <furq> does it work with x264
[22:21:34] <zumba_addict> yes, very well
[22:21:44] <zumba_addict> i'm just curious about vaapi
[22:21:50] <zumba_addict> i wanted to try it
[22:22:31] <furq> could be your player is falling back to swdec with the x264 encode because it's not yuv420p
[22:22:40] <zumba_addict> ah
[22:22:46] <zumba_addict> should I add pix_fmt? I can try
[22:22:58] <furq> well your hwenc will only do yuv420p
[22:23:06] <furq> you probably want to force swdec in your player
[22:23:26] <zumba_addict> i'lll try other players
[22:23:27] <BtbN> software decoding 4K might be too much for that CPU
[22:23:37] <furq> if you rerun the x264 encode with -pix_fmt yuv420p then it'll probably have the same issue
[22:23:44] <zumba_addict> no, I am able to play it fine
[22:24:23] <zumba_addict> i can try but I'm sure I always use that
[22:25:28] <furq> if you still have the x264 encode then post the ffprobe output for it

[22:26:13] <zumba_addict> i'm running this now - ffmpeg -i GOPR1082.MP4.mov -ss 00:00:00 -to 00:00:15 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p test2.mp4
[22:26:25] <furq> if it's not then your player won't even try to swdec it, which i guess is the difference
[22:26:34] <zumba_addict> k
[22:28:10] <zumba_addict> oh crap, it's the player
[22:28:41] <furq> well it's your hwdec rather than the player
[22:28:56] <zumba_addict> i've always used smplayer. I didn't realize I started using mplayer last night.I did a history of mplayer and I use it for testing m4a and mp3 only
[22:29:04] <zumba_addict> got it
[22:29:12] <furq> you should probably use mpv nowadays though
[22:29:18] <zumba_addict> so test.mp4 playback was great in smplayer
[22:29:20] <BtbN> Anything mplayer is very dead
[22:29:25] <zumba_addict> got it
[22:29:30] <furq> you can use mpv as a backend to smplayer i think
[22:29:34] <zumba_addict> i should uninstall it
[22:29:36] <furq> maybe that's the default now
[22:29:44] <zumba_addict> yes, it is using mpv as I see in htop
[22:29:57] <zumba_addict> i mean, i should uninstall mplayer
[22:30:15] <zumba_addict> what's a good replacement for playing mp3 or m4a in the command line?
[22:30:29] <zumba_addict> aplay?
[22:31:04] <BtbN> mpv
[22:31:13] <zumba_addict> lol, i always had a heard attack just now
[22:31:27] <zumba_addict> i ran aplay some.m4a, the volumes was so loud
[22:31:34] <BtbN> Doesn't aplay only play uncompressed wav?
[22:31:35] <zumba_addict> it was hissing sound
[22:31:47] <furq> mpv works fine for that
[22:31:51] <furq> it won't spawn a window by default for audio
[22:31:53] <zumba_addict> ok, i'll try mpv
[22:31:54] <furq> unless there's album art
[22:31:57] <BtbN> Yeah, aplay will just interpret whatever you give it as raw pcm
[22:32:27] <zumba_addict> wow, mpv works :)
[22:33:38] <zumba_addict> so weird, my debian always sets volume to 150% when  new player is played
[22:33:55] <zumba_addict> I always have to open pulseaudio to drag volume down for that specific app
[22:34:46] <zumba_addict> oh, I think i found the culprit
[22:37:19] <zumba_addict> Thank you all! Learned a lot today :)
[22:38:19] <zumba_addict> mplayer uninstalled too
