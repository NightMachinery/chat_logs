[09:59:52] <jim> did you build your own python?
[09:59:54] <sudomann> At that point in time, there would be no python installed
[10:00:23] <jim> so the python you have now is not from a debian package?

Basically, a friend shuts off their computer without hibernating and what's on screen is what they had before.
[14:22:47] <Mystified1234> jim oops, showing 2 linux os.
[14:23:12] <hexnewbie> YET the saved terminals are completely useless, and all you do is to close them. Not running the same program that was running inside (ssh, mc, vim, etc.) even if the directory is correct is not of any use

[14:28:10] <Thaurwylth> Jim, I might try that, but that sounds a bit questionable... I mean back with 21.04 I created the stick exactly the same way, definitely not using dd or dd mode. At least one of those stick creator programs is still in the same version as back then. Unless this is some problem that has verifiably appeared since then. But let's see how this goes...
[14:28:15] <koollman> (also, I do get what you mean. CRIU is not purely academic, but not as useful as it could be. and openvz creators are the only other exception I know of with a useful implementation :) )

[14:29:45] <koollman> they aren't. They are ... not as useful as they could be, but still can be useful outside academic settings

[15:44:41] <velix> runtimes, needed libs etc*
[15:44:47] <mlu> velix: exactly
[15:45:07] <velix> mlu: Actually, whenever I use "apt" on debian, I feel it's bloated :D
[15:45:08] <mlu> not worse than those statically-linked chrome builds though
[15:45:14] <mlu> ditto
[15:45:30] <mlu> this is why I personally chose a distro called Solus
[15:45:40] <velix> mlu: What's its base?
[15:45:41] <mlu> on servers, Alpine is my preferred distro
[15:45:58] <velix> mlu: I like Alpine, but I've bad experience with MUSL.
[15:46:09] <mlu> velix: it's quite unique: there's a packaging system called eopkg that was adapted from a Turkish govt's attempt at a Linux distro
[15:46:18] *** Quits: skep (~raah@user/skep) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:46:26] <mlu> I chose Solus because I wanted a distro that "just worked" but was also minimalist
[15:46:28] <velix> mlu: I'm half-turk, but I wouldn't trust a Turkish Linux distro ;)
[15:46:50] <mlu> I'd say it achieves that quite well: it's very easy to roll your own packages for eopkg, it's only slightly more complex than apk
[15:46:52] <velix> I don't even trust the kebap meat at the guy on my street corner ;) but it's tasty.
[15:47:16] <mlu> there's toolchains to convert both apt and rpm packages automatically (with the ability to patch them up better if necessary)
[15:47:34] <velix> mlu: I'll have a look, thanks.

[16:37:56] <sheep> did you recently have a power failure?
[16:38:02] <Blondie101010> you need to do it or it will do the same thing repeatedly
[16:38:06] *** Joins: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch)
[16:38:17] <Blondie101010> the FS is marked as non clean
[16:38:51] <hexnewbie> That sounds *worse* than a power failure, since a power failure should merely cause an unclear filesystem, which is at best a journal replay, at worst causes fsck *after* the initramfs. Dropping you to initramfs means read-only mount of / failed, I think, unless Arch's initramfs is odd
[16:39:05] <sheep> if I remember correctly, the initramfs or systemd will run fsck every few mounts or every few weeks or if the filesystem was not cleanly unmounted to detect possible corruption

[17:55:05] <DPA> Yes, but more importantly, if I have something like "curl thing | decompress", I can't use "file /dev/stdin" there, as it would consume the pipe.

[17:55:26] <peetaur> ( s/write/right/     what a strange typo)

[17:56:02] <rustytaco> it might have a mode to support buffered io but i dont think so
[17:56:18] <rustytaco> since it needs to check bytes at various offsets in the stream for magic values

[21:07:26] <tirnanog> NGC3982: rsnapshot appears to discard the stderr of its sub-processes. that's too bad.

[21:07:58] <NGC3982> "There's a limit of about 32,000 links per inode. (smells like an unsigned short) Each folder makes a link to its parent folder, so you were going to try to make some 50k links to a single inode, which wasn't going to fly."

[22:49:16] <peetaur> for example my 4K montior shows      3840x2160     29.98   which is unusably horrid and then     1920x1080     59.97    59.96    60.00*   59.94    59.93    is down a few lines

[23:41:31] <petaflot> hello! I'm trying to display some text with `toilet hello > /dev/tty0` but I have no carriage returns and the output is garbled. I found no option in toilet itself, but I was wondering if this is somehow settable for the tty?

[23:45:32] <babyface> tusko, *disk partitioning?
[23:45:59] <tusko> If you want disk partitioning you probably want to look at parted and gparted

[23:55:53] <ghostbuster> hexnewbie: TIL
[23:55:56] <hexnewbie> ghostbuster: gparted simply uses libparted as a partition editing library, it's other common points with the parted interface are non-existent
