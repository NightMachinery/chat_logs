[13:49:35] <TTime> so how is ethereum different from Bitcoin
[13:50:04] <destroyer> go ask Ethereum
[13:50:11] <destroyer> this is Bitcoin channel
[13:50:16] <TTime> I know I can Google this questions but I just want to know the opinion of actual Bitcoin users
[13:50:20] <Alver> Ethereum is not properly/fully distributed, and developers have already forcefully rolled back transactions to "fix" the effects of a hack.
[13:50:54] <Alver> Which means they have the power to do this, which means you have to trust them. In bitcoin you don't have to (and are encouraged not to) trust anyone.
[13:50:54] <TTime> so they set a precedent that's dangerous
[13:51:16] <destroyer> there was a rollback in Bitcoin too but today that would be impossible
[13:51:22] <TTime> I heard about the Ethereum barons
[13:52:18] <destroyer> if someone find a vulnerability in Bitcoin, he can split the chain multiple times
[13:52:55] <destroyer> in an irreversible way I may add
[13:54:47] <TTime> I'm glad I'm broke so I don't have to stay up at night worrying about Bitcoin

[14:12:11] <Alver> But yes, BTC "main" is not meant to be used for actual payments. Too slow, too expensive.
[14:12:18] <destroyer> "Don't Trust, Verify"
[14:12:27] <buZz> destroyer: why? do they give you a tour of their vault containing USD too?
[14:12:42] <Alver> buZz: they don't need to. They just send a picture of the printer. Brrrrrrrr.
[14:12:46] <buZz> why on earth would they gift you insight into their finances
[14:13:07] <destroyer> I can also tweet without any evidence, I brought 500 Bitcoin
[14:13:07] <buZz> even your own gov probably only -barely- does that once a year
[14:13:13] <buZz> in a format nearly nobody understands
[14:13:13] <Alver> ... well, if they're constantly announcing how much they've bought, it's not a crazy idea to be able to actually see that too. :D
[14:13:17] <buZz> destroyer: who the fuck cares
[14:13:26] <destroyer> I do care
[14:13:29] <buZz> why
[14:13:29] <Alver> It would probably benefit their cause too
[14:13:36] <buZz> Alver: what -is- their cause?
[14:13:57] <Alver> buZz: it would give additional trust in their commitment to bitcoin as tender, I'd say.
[14:14:02] <destroyer> Because I using Bitcoin and I don't like to see fraud, people claiming this and that without showing any TX on the block chain
[14:14:25] <buZz> keep the following in mind :  1) el salvador has NO national currency for AGES now , 2) barely 10% of citizens have a mobile phone or internet access , 3) el salvador wants to increase tourism
[14:15:02] <buZz> 4) mobile phone network is really cheap there 5) people that DO own phones were already increasingly using 'cashapp' and other nonsense
[14:15:37] <buZz> did you see the video i linked yet? it shows you how MANY nontouristy locations in el salvador have almost 0 merchants accepting btc
[14:15:59] <destroyer> Tourism to a fascist country? Citizens literally jailed for questioning Nayib Bukele about the money he supposedly spending on Bitcoin.
[14:16:11] <buZz> yes destroyer , there's even tourism to US
[14:16:16] <buZz> wtf does fascism have to do with it
[14:16:17] <destroyer> lol
[14:16:29] <buZz> destroyer: you can ask the guy who made the video i linked to literally show your a tx he did
[14:16:36] <buZz> he's kind and approachable
[14:16:54] <destroyer> Nayib Bukele is branded by the Human Rights Watch as a far-right authoritarian (some even say he is a dictator)
[14:17:05] <Alver> "some say"

[15:02:57] <buZz> > The increasing state size, however, is a concern -- one which utreexo solves.
[15:03:12] <buZz> where just 2 lines up they state > This state size has generally increased over time, but has in fact decreased a bit this year.
[15:03:24] <Earnestly> buZz: The tradeoff appears to be higher bandwidth usage but for small storage usage
[15:03:41] <buZz> 4GB isnt that big, why would we care?
[15:04:03] <buZz> they only tested it on btc up to 2019? why
[15:04:25] <buZz> oh they didnt post news between 2021 and 2019 , lets see
[15:04:29] <Earnestly> buZz: Hm, it's not 4GB, but the entire blockchain
[15:04:47] <buZz> no, its about the UTXO state
[15:04:52] <buZz> not the block history
[15:05:17] <Earnestly> buZz: No they include that, the stated desire is to have this thing running "full node" on openwrt routers
[15:05:37] <Earnestly> From what I gathered anyway
[15:05:55] <buZz> > It's important to distinguish between the transaction history and the current state of the system.
[15:06:00] <buZz> > The history, despite its much larger size, is not in fact the scalability concern
[15:06:16] <buZz> > Utreexo is a novel hash based dynamic accumulator, which allows the millions of unspent outputs to be represented in under a kilobyte
[15:06:33] <buZz> but their software cant even make transactions ..
[15:06:56] <buZz> oh, it can, just by relying on other ppls mempools i guess
[15:07:56] <Earnestly> buZz: I read it as them suggesting the total history is large when compared to the 4GB of information about current ownership.  And current levels of ownership does indeep go up and down as people buy and sell
[15:08:06] <Earnestly> They want to focus on representing just hat information without the total history

[15:10:43] <Earnestly> buZz: To the degree that it can meet the claims, one thing I did like is their suggestion that they can decouple storage medium (leveldb) from consensus
[15:11:06] <Earnestly> It says no fork needed, but it is kind of a pseudo-soft-fork
[15:11:13] <buZz> Earnestly: i just see them talk about utxo , not blockstorage

[15:15:50] <buZz> yes, thats 'pruning'
[15:15:53] <Earnestly> They could be clearer, they focus too much on utxo size
[15:15:54] <buZz> in normal bitcoincore
[15:15:55] <Earnestly> Yes
[15:16:10] <buZz> mostly > is not in fact the scalability concern
[15:16:17] <Earnestly> Yeah I don't get that
[15:16:18] <buZz> makes me believe this isnt their focus
[15:16:29] <Earnestly> I don't know why they include that sentence because it makes no sense
[15:18:06] <Earnestly> buZz: If this was just about utxo size then it would be completely useless as you suggest
[15:18:25] <Earnestly> You might be right, I just didn't read it like that because it makes no sense
[15:18:43] <buZz> they keep talking about 'bitcoin state'
[15:18:53] <buZz> which they describe as being 4GB now and shrinking ?
[15:19:11] <Earnestly> buZz: It's not shrinking, it's just lower atm.  It can go up and down
[15:19:18] <Earnestly> Depends how many hodl
[15:19:21] <buZz> Earnestly: another hint, the name Utreexo
[15:19:28] <buZz> UTreeXO
[15:19:29] <Earnestly> Oh yes
[15:19:37] <buZz> logo is a tree
[15:19:48] <Earnestly> Yes, they want to turn utxos into merkel tree
[15:20:25] <Earnestly> buZz: They also say archival nodes will still need to exist, IBD still done (can be parallelised though).  And also state that if you keep history, utreexo will be larger
[15:20:28] <buZz> Earnestly: this blog post by a DCI member might help understand it some more ; https://blog.bitmex.com/progress-towards-utreexo-goals/
[15:20:32] <Earnestly> Because it's all blocks and their proofs
[15:21:10] <Earnestly> buZz: See first claim, full node in kBs
[15:21:20] <buZz> yeah
[15:21:26] <Earnestly> Wouldn't make sense if they expect you to have all history
[15:21:42] <buZz> right, but they state that claim isnt possible now
[15:21:52] <Earnestly> buZz: The way I read it is that it's a given, the remaining problem is utxo size, so they want to deal with that
[15:22:27] <Earnestly> buZz: https://dci.mit.edu/research/2021/2/2/utreexo-demo-release-02-by-tadge-dryja hmm, some numbers
[15:22:27] <buZz> scroll to > Why Claim 1 is important
[15:22:36] <buZz> and > Current Progress on Claim 1
[15:23:12] <buZz> ah > For this release, we settled for a couple hundred megabytes.
[15:23:45] <buZz> > With Bitcoin Core, running it on the NVMe SSD took 784 seconds while it took 1,066 seconds on the HDD. For Utreexo CSN, running it on the NVMe SSD took 1,643 seconds while it took 1,700 seconds on the HDD.
[15:23:48] <buZz> hehehe
[15:24:21] <Earnestly> Still really new clearly
[15:24:42] <Earnestly> buZz: Yeah, they're using btcd
[15:24:56] <buZz> uhuh and want to abandon it to increase speed
[15:25:31] <buZz> well, 2019
[15:25:43] <buZz> and seems mostly a single dev?
