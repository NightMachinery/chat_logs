[00:29:43] <bruxc> Hey, sort of a silly question but not sure where else to ask. In my Pop_OS! "Pop Shop" I keep getting an annoying update message for Postman. Looking further into the issue, it's because the flatpak URL for the download is incorrect thus sending a 404 error. How or where would I escalate an issue like this to an entity like Postman?

[01:01:24] <rendar> amacater, it seems autoremove removed my network-manager!!!!
[01:01:27] <rendar> unbelievable
[01:01:54] *** Joins: LtL (~debian@user/ltl)
[01:02:06] <amacater> Right: What was your network manager beforehand.
[01:02:17] <rendar> huh?
[01:03:05] <rendar> https://bpa.st/4VNQ
[01:03:08] <rendar> amacater, check this
[01:04:45] <amacater> rendar: Lets start with the basics: You were on buster. You upgraded. Stuff broke. What form of networking do you have - wired/wifi? What is the output of uname -a?
[01:05:06] <amacater> If all else fails: are you in a position to reinstall?
[01:05:18] <joepublic> I think we already found the problem, no network-manager
[01:05:26] <rendar> amacater, i upgraded correctly, stuff didn't broke
[01:05:32] <rendar> i just uninstalled some useless packages
[01:05:39] <rendar> then autoremove REMOVED NETWORK MANAGER!
[01:05:58] <joepublic> same thing happened to me when I upgraded to bullseye, though I reinstalled network-manager with quite a bit less drama
[01:06:00] <jkc> rendar: If there was nothing installed that wanted network-manager, then that's what autoremove will do.
[01:06:13] <amacater> _What_ did you try to uninstal and why? autoremove tells you what it will remove
[01:06:14] <jkc> "It is recommended that you examine the package removals proposed by each method before proceeding."
[01:06:23] <jkc> Right in the bullseye upgrade notes.
[01:06:43] <rendar> amacater, autoremove should just be a cleaning tool, it shouldn't remove critical packages imho
[01:06:51] <jkc> network-manager isn't a critical package.
[01:06:57] <rendar> oh right
[01:06:59] <rendar> it's not
[01:07:07] <rendar> network unreachable at boot
[01:07:10] <rendar> not so critical, no
[01:07:31] <jkc> None of my servers have network-manager, and they have connectivity. "critical" packages are those required for minimal function.
[01:07:32] <joepublic> rendar, as I understand it, your problem has been troubleshooted and the solution found, right?
[01:07:50] <jkc> I hate to say this, but it's your system, and it's your responsibility to verify that what the system is proposing is correct.
[01:08:12] <rendar> joepublic, yes, but i want to complaining for another 5 minutes about this
[01:08:20] <rendar> because it wiped 2hrs of my life
[01:08:34] <joepublic> okay.  makes sense.

[01:08:40] <rendar> :)
[01:09:26] <amacater> With the best will: You haven't told us what you wanted to remove. It's probable that something like removing gnome-common for example, removes a whole bunch of stuff. Removing useless package has knock on effects
[01:10:17] <rendar> amacater, i was removing a f!@#$ gnome useless process that was consuming 100% of cpu
[01:10:26] <joepublic> speaking for myself personally, merely upgrading buster -> bullseye resulted in no network-manager, also after an autoremove.  Before, something wanted it; after, nothing did.
[01:10:29] <amacater> That's why I asked about a reinstall - which might sometimes be quicker
[01:11:16] <amacater> So - ps -elf to find out which one it is : kill -9 / pskill it - then troubleshoot why

[04:21:07] <ectospasm> JordiGH:  You may want to consider using another key slot for your LUKS volume, and store the password in a password manager so if this ever happens again, you'll have a backup method of unlocking it.  I believe a LUKS device can have up to eight (0-7) keys lots filled, so you could even have a separate key file as well.

[04:22:16] <JordiGH> Yeah, I only have this one machine.
[04:22:40] <JordiGH> You can also unlock LUKS with an external device, right?
[04:23:06] <ectospasm> Using a key file, yes.
[04:23:09] <JordiGH> PMT: I was pretty close, I think John the Ripper can do it? I just have to generate the list of all passwords that are close by.

[04:31:12] <jhutchins> If it was a simple matter of downloading a program to crack a LUKS password there wouldn't be much point in having LUKS.

[15:10:37] <Khepra> all grub does is locate /boot, load up kernel and exec it with params given for its cmdline, and initramfs cpio file
[15:12:56] <sgon> Khepra: thanks a lot. But I did uncompress initramfs cpio file before. All I found is one file called `GenuineIntel.bin` . I don't find `crypttab` file. 
[15:13:48] <sgon> I used the command `cpio -id < initrd.img` 
[15:14:33] <Khepra> sgon: that means you probably don't have cryptsetup-initramfs installed, and /etc/crypttab set up for encrypted rootfs ?
[15:14:51] <PMT> I recommend examining it with lsinitramfs if you just care about the file presence and not their contents.
[15:15:17] <sgon> Khepra: I have them. and running luks root right now. 
[15:15:29] <PMT> or you could use unmkinitramfs to extract things nicer.
[15:15:50] <Khepra> then you must have /cryptroot/crypttab in your initramfs.   ls /boot/initrd.img-<version> | grep crypttab
[15:16:00] <Khepra> lsinitramfs*
[15:16:14] <sgon> PMT: thanks a lot. lsinitramfs returns many many files.  So cpio id is not correct way to uncompress ?
[15:16:27] <PMT> cpio can work.
[15:16:54] <sgon> what is the correct cpio command? cpio id just gives me one file.. weird. 
[15:17:36] <PMT> I believe that's because it contains an uncompressed thing at the start and then more compressed things later.

[15:44:25] <NiLon> well you start apache as background job say from ssh and once that connection dies, the server dies with it, not very practical
[15:44:45] <NiLon> you would need to disown it, but now if you want to say restart it, how you do that

[15:48:16] <no_gravity> Khepra: What is my "process manager"?
[15:49:03] <willow> plus there is the journaling function of systemd
[15:49:04] <sgon> no_gravity: server reboots. `apache2 &` won't be restarted. If you use container, I am not familiar with. So that is a special container question.

[15:50:26] <willow> startup dependencies is another important feature
[15:50:32] <NiLon> sgon containers have many useful features, of of being that you can easily set up identical production and developement environment, you can easily roll back changes, have version control, ability to run multiple instances without extra hassle etc.

[15:57:36] <no_gravity> When I "apache2 &" it does.
[15:57:39] <NiLon> then you have not set it to log there
[15:58:04] <no_gravity> Well, why the difference depending on how Apache is started?
[15:58:04] <Khepra> "service" calls up the systemd unit. is your service unit somehow broken, preventing writing to that logpath?
[15:58:20] <NiLon> it is apache doing some dynamic decision of where it sends logs
[15:58:24] <no_gravity> Khepra: I am talking about a plain Debian install without any config.
[15:58:45] <Khepra> which also means, unless that really is a sysv system (see !devian) you should use systemctl directly for better control
[15:58:52] <NiLon> also the journaling system from systemd is actually super good compared to file logs
[15:59:14] <NiLon> it has many features you might not even realize
[15:59:30] <Khepra> no_gravity: you also mentioned docker container. a docker could be totally 100% differently configured thatn default .deb packaged apache on debian
[15:59:55] <NiLon> but if you prefer, even as service you can tell it to write into file, nothing stops you
[16:00:39] <no_gravity> NiLon: How so?
[16:00:56] <NiLon> http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html or whatever version you are using
[16:01:10] <no_gravity> Khepra: Why? It is the default debian container. Not a special Apache container.
[16:01:28] <Khepra> no_gravity: made by whom?
[16:02:00] <no_gravity> Khepra: Its two Debian members who make the Docker images.
[16:02:16] <Khepra> so anyway, the bottom line here is simple. a "service" (managed by a process manger like systemd, openrc, ...) does not per se make anything different in this regar, UNLESS it's configured like that

[16:07:31] <NiLon> no_gravity syslog for example has many benefits over just logging into a file. Say you have 100 servers, the moment error happens you could set it to ring your phone about a problem instead of problem being hidden for hours until you manually go and look
[16:08:04] <mrfb> I can't find a reason why it shouldn't work.

[16:09:50] <no_gravity> Khepra: This sounds like a misunderstanding.
[16:09:57] <Khepra> perhaps. 
[16:10:37] <Khepra> no_gravity: most importantly, apache can be configured for different logging options. so if you want A over B, reconfiugure it.  or was your question about why defaults are A or B?

[16:14:21] <NiLon> and reason why services are used is due the extra control
[16:14:30] <Khepra> was the question "why is docker different" or was the quesstion "how do I get apache to write into error.log"?
[16:14:53] <no_gravity> Khepra: Please scroll up :)
[16:15:09] <Khepra> the question about services seems like xy question abot some other problem that's not intrinsic to service but something else
[16:15:11] <NiLon> for example say your apache server crashes, the service manager can start it again right up. If you started it manually it would stay dead until you come and manually start it again
[16:15:12] <sgon> I recommend nginx.

[16:16:01] <NiLon> yeah and it can try to start it say 10 times before ringing you about iit
[16:16:22] <sgon> Btw, is there a log service in this channel? Where can I check the log? I am having an unstable network. Disconnect a lot. 
[16:16:50] <no_gravity> Is the thing that starts stuff via "service xyz start" called systemd?
[16:17:13] <NiLon> and also if you have many things, for example you have apache and then websocket server. With services you could say that every time I start apache, also start websocket server
[16:17:30] <NiLon> so it enabled all it needs with one go, also shuts them down if required etc.
[16:18:01] <Khepra> a service process manager like systemd has many more features and functions that all that, tho.
[16:18:15] <joepublic> from the man page: "service  runs a System V init script or systemd unit"

[19:46:15] <Blondie101010> muhblockchain:  that is actually a very complex question that developpers learn over the years

[19:47:18] *** Joins: johnfs (~johnfs@user/johnfs)
[19:47:56] <Blondie101010> muhblockchain:  one of the simpler common single file DBs is Sqlite
[19:48:25] <muhblockchain> Blondie101010: I want to see updates (diffs) of it, inside git workflow (because it allows e.g. checksums, signatures)
[19:48:58] <Blondie101010> that is not the way a DB works
[19:49:10] <muhblockchain> that's what I put database in quotes
[19:49:25] <Blondie101010> you don't get my point..
[19:49:43] <Blondie101010> if you need to implement something that tracks changes, you do that in your DB structure

[19:55:32] <Blondie101010> how do you find the deletions?
[19:56:00] <Blondie101010> do you need to hire someone full time to do git operations to track things instead of just using a real DB schema where you could do it in a 5 second query?
[19:56:20] <muhblockchain> Blondie101010: git log -p for deletions. CSV tools to find records.  I do not how ever work much with old changes, just need a log to exist with checksums (against gitrot) and signatures
[19:56:39] <Blondie101010> hmmmmmmmmm... what is the use case for this?
[19:57:04] <Blondie101010> if it's something that only changes once a month, fine, and you therefore just lost the time already
[19:57:32] <Blondie101010> that was my initial point on developer experience

[20:04:59] <Blondie101010> but so far you didn't even answer me what is the purpose
[20:05:20] <muhblockchain> abrotman: any tool to load json(s) and view them as tables/database (ideally, with relations between tables), edit and save then, in Debian? or at all?
[20:05:22] <Blondie101010> abrotman:  he wants it per line to do a git diff on it
[20:05:32] <Blondie101010> because you know that's how DBs work, right???
[20:05:52] <muhblockchain> actually I do not want record-per-line, because lines are getting long. json sounds good
[20:05:58] <abrotman> muhblockchain: FIIK, but if you want an actual DB, use an actual DB .. not a flat file pretending to be such.  That's how we ended up with websites running on top of MSAccess
[20:06:02] <Blondie101010> muhblockchain:  exactly..  you just broke your own premise
[20:06:05] <Blondie101010> use sqlite
[20:06:21] <abrotman> sqlite is reasonable, but you need to use SQL to get things in/out .. 
[20:06:45] <Blondie101010> it's easy to use, to backup
[20:06:51] <muhblockchain> sqlite, but files should be flat and deterministic, that would be it
[20:07:10] <abrotman> or however, not a full ACID DB IIRC .. but if it's for basic tasks, definitely fine
[20:07:14] <muhblockchain> not sure why Blondie101010 really wants to drop my requierement of heaving all changes tracked (meaninfully) in git
[20:07:25] <Blondie101010> no your lack of experience makes you imagine that what is in your head is better than a good solution
