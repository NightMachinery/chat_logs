[00:09:15] <manicennui> I don't have much hope.
[00:09:31] <manicennui> But Democrats also have a veto proof super majority in the legislature there.

[00:09:39] <Brekkjern> Is it too salty to comment "I can't wait for universities to completely ignore this release and still only allow usage of Java 8."?
[00:09:40] <buttsbot> Java 17 / JDK 17: General Availability | Lobsters
[00:09:52] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Nope.
[00:09:58] <manicennui> Many companies are stuck behind too.
[00:10:01] <indigo> Brekkjern: At least Android moved to Kotlin
[00:10:09] <Brekkjern> Fuck it. Then I'm commenting it :P
[00:10:22] <manicennui> I wouldn't be surprised if most of the people using more recent versions of the JDK are people using non-Java languages.
[00:11:01] <manicennui> But in a decade when Java shops start using JDK 17, they will have records!

[01:04:10] <Brekkjern> :P
[01:04:21] <prussian> well the codebase is in fact 1.6
[01:04:38] <prussian> and the compiler that compiles the java source only works with 1.8
[01:04:42] <prussian> it's uh fun
[01:04:46] <prussian> anyhow
[01:04:54] <prussian> happy work tuesday
[01:06:04] <gwozniak> I recently installed Java 16 and one of our Ant tasks stopped working because of some reflection thing
[01:06:12] <gwozniak> Needs Java 15 or lower
[01:06:44] <prussian> epic
[01:07:23] <gwozniak> And there are those here to think Ant is too modern
[01:07:38] <prussian> whoa... what were they doing pre-ant?
[01:07:51] <Brekkjern> Larva?
[01:08:09] <prussian> good guess.
[01:08:16] <gwozniak> Make or bust
[01:08:20] <Brekkjern> Or maybe just an egg. I don't think ants have a larval stage?
[01:09:17] <gwozniak> I should point out those who fear Ant's modernity also don't use Java
[01:11:00] <Brekkjern> Evidently not :P
[01:23:07] <gwozniak> Jezuz, what a day
[01:25:40] <gwozniak> Trying to understand why someone would change the function signature of a low-level, internal ABI function in the hopes that it would change the way values are passed in registers
[01:26:06] <gwozniak> Like, all you need to do is compile it and see that it doesn't work as intended
[01:29:17] <gwozniak> When a low-level ABI function is not working properly, you get a ton of test failures.  So today was spent showing that all the issues assigned to me are the result of that one problem
[01:29:31] <indigo> Oh nooo
[01:29:44] <indigo> How did that even make it in the code?
[01:30:17] <gwozniak> Well, I can't really say but basically we trusted an external library too much
[01:30:43] <gwozniak> On the upside, that one problem will make a ton of failures go away
[01:30:51] <gwozniak> er, fixing that one problem
[01:31:26] <Brekkjern> And introduce 7 more!
[01:31:33] <prussian> ahhh... ABI...
[01:31:44] <Brekkjern> Take one down, patch it around. 101 bugs in the code!
[01:31:59] <prussian> this Brazilian feature needs ABI stability since recompile means recertification (enforced by shasum).
[01:32:01] <prussian> swear to god.
[01:32:18] <prussian> oops, I accidentally did (dumb thing here).
[01:32:44] <prussian> 'ate abi, simple as that.
[01:32:48] <gwozniak> prussian: that kind of thing sounds familiar
[01:36:00] <Brekkjern> What the hell is this task even asking of me?
[01:36:54] <Brekkjern> I'm supposed to take a set of integers from stdin, and output them in an order that would result in a balanced binary tree, without implementing a balanced binary tree?
[01:37:20] <prussian> w-wut
[01:39:00] <Brekkjern> Freely translated: "You do not need to implement a binary search tree. All you need to do is to print the elements you get as input in an order that guarantees that we get a balanced tree if we add the elements into the binary tree with regular insert."
[01:39:10] <Brekkjern> "This binary tree is not self-balancing."
[01:48:43] <indigo> I guess you can start with the center of a sorted list, and then divide and conquer?
[01:49:11] <indigo> r e c u r s i o n
[01:49:18] <Brekkjern> I don't have the faintest idea :P
[01:49:32] <Brekkjern> I'm looking at the example input and output and it doesn't make any sense at all
[01:52:09] <riv> i dont like these made up problems
[01:52:19] <Brekkjern> You and me both...
[01:52:19] <indigo> Is it like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -> 4 2 6 1 3 5 7
[01:52:52] <Brekkjern> The example is 0..10 -> 5, 8, 10, 9, 7, 6, 2, 4, 3, 1, 0
[01:54:17] <indigo> That's a fun traversal
[01:59:12] <indigo> I hope they have a diagram for that output
[01:59:18] <Brekkjern> lolno
[01:59:23] <Brekkjern> That would be too easy
[01:59:50] <Brekkjern> I mean, they have an example of what is a balanced and what isn't a balanced tree, but they don't label the values of the nodes, so it's not really helpful...
[02:00:25] <Brekkjern> They have a definition here, but I don't really understand the point of it.
[02:02:02] <Brekkjern> "In this task we want to build a completely balanced binary search tree. We define this as a binary search tree where there are 2^d nodes with a depth d, where 0 <= d < h and h is the height of the tree. Another way to say the same is that the shortest and the longest path from the root to an empty subtree has a difference in length of 0 or 1."
[02:03:15] <Brekkjern> Do they just mean that the tree is made by going right on higher numbers, and left on lower, and the resulting tree should not have a difference of more than 1 in depth on all paths?
[02:03:28] <indigo> Wikipedia has a way better definition: "A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1."
[02:03:54] <Brekkjern> Wouldn't be the first time Wikipedia has a better fucking definition than this course...
[02:06:19] <Brekkjern> I think I understand it now, but I'm not sure how to make the algorithm yet
[02:06:50] <indigo> I'm glad I bought a huge notepad for my desk specifically for Brekkjern's problems™
[02:07:35] <Brekkjern> lol
[02:08:12] <indigo> I'm still having a hard time translating the output to a binary tree
[02:09:28] <Brekkjern> Do the higher value to the left
[02:11:16] <indigo> Wat
[02:12:15] <indigo> Is this just a binary tree and not a binary search tree
[02:13:10] <Brekkjern> They say it's supposed to be a binary search tree
[02:14:38] <Brekkjern> https://i.imgur.com/MPc5nst.png
[02:14:42] <Brekkjern> As far as I see, this makes sense
[02:14:52] <Brekkjern> With the example input and output
[02:15:08] <Brekkjern> It would be balanced, and there is some sort of logic to it.
[02:15:18] <indigo> That's really odd, because BST is supposed to have larger values on the right LOL

[19:48:07] <dimadima> original or new?
[19:48:12] <manicennui> And there are always summaries afterward.
[19:48:19] <dimadima> so what's the controversy
[19:48:22] <manicennui> I think the real question is whether every announcement needs to be on lobsters.
[19:48:28] <dimadima> yeah i only find it mildly irritating
[19:48:45] <dimadima> ah so that's the controversy
[19:49:01] <manicennui> Makes sense on orange site where they are more focused on such things.
[19:49:45] <manicennui> Unless Apple announces something truly technologically remarkable.
[19:49:52] <manicennui> This was just product refreshes.
[19:50:12] <dimadima> i get tired of seeing that shit on the orange site too, tbh
[19:51:01] <manicennui> It makes sense there because a lot of people's businesses are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.
[19:52:00] <dimadima> see their events would be a lot more intersting if every product update wasn't presented as the best thing to every happen to humanity
[19:52:15] <dimadima> but hey that's how they roll and make tons of money
