[03:56:28] <greycat> What was the one on Freenode, and did it come over here?
[03:57:20] <e36freak> i don't remember, and i don't think so. there are a few options, or one would probably be easy enough to write with just that bare minimum feature
[03:57:56] <greycat> How often do flood-spammers occur?  I've only been here intermittently.
[04:00:08] <tirnanog> I've only seen once incident preceding this one. presumably someone, with a bee under their bonnet following a prior experience here.
[04:00:11] <tirnanog> it's the same person, at any rate.

[04:08:27] <greycat> well, they had a different IP address this time, different local username, and not registered... so, options include blocking unregistered users, or letting ops handle it, or bringing in Sigyn or an equivalent
[04:08:58] <tirnanog> anyway, Candide has flood control and its owner, pragma, seems like a cool guy.

[04:11:51] <e36freak> yes, candide would be one option
[04:12:16] <e36freak> plus we could compile and run C!
[04:12:37] <tirnanog> sssh!
[04:13:04] <pj> I'm all for blocking unregistered users.
[04:13:16] <e36freak> i think we did at one point and people complained
[04:13:24] <e36freak> i know i got complaints about it in either #sed or #awk
[04:13:31] * pj nods
[04:13:45] <tirnanog> against. the collateral damage is real and not merited, in my opinion.
[04:13:58] <Riviera> mh
[04:13:58] <pj> It makes channel ops so much easier, though.
[04:14:06] <tirnanog> a middle ground would be auto-voicing after a delay, which Candide can do but still ... it can cause confusion.
[04:14:42] <Riviera> e36freak: i hope you did not take it as a complaint when these restrictions were removed when not seeming necessary anymore. i'd be for reintroducing them when needed.
[04:15:04] <tirnanog> not everyone else should have to suffer because one miscreant is causing a nuisance at this particular juncture.
[04:15:10] <pj> or you can just +q $~r
[04:15:17] <e36freak> Riviera: complaint isn't necessarily meant in a negative way there
[04:15:31] <Riviera> same with an automatic ban on flood bot, perhaps it would be okayish in the current situation, but i'd not necessary like it as something permanent.
[04:15:40] <e36freak> grievance, maybe?
[04:15:41] <Riviera> e36freak: understood
[04:15:45] <Riviera> e36freak: oh
[04:15:48] <Riviera> e36freak: now that's worse :D
[04:15:50] <tirnanog> pj: same issue, really. it help a bit, but also hurts a fair bit.
[04:16:10] <pj> I prefer short auto-quiet on flood, just to stop the floods, and yeah, I get it.  Was just saying I'm all for it.
[04:16:29] <tirnanog> auto-quiet seems applicable for this case.
[04:16:43] <Riviera> why?
[04:16:48] <e36freak> my suggestion was kick on flood, 3 strike rule or whatever for a temporary ban
[04:16:52] <pj> yeah, usually flood is not malicious just someone that doesn't understand to use a pastebin.
[04:16:57] <e36freak> noobs do make mistakes, do not need to be punished for it
[04:17:21] <pj> the auto-quiet stops the flood and a message to the user, the quiet gets lifted after about 30 seconds or so.
[04:17:26] <tirnanog> e36freak: yeah. just saw it happen in another channel. heh.

[04:20:24] <pj> yeah, also with more aned more people coming from services such as slack, matrix, etc, where the norm is to paste large blocks directly in the chat (as a code block) they don't understand that IRC is different.
[04:20:55] <Riviera> how often did these floods happen recently?
[04:21:05] <pj> not very often
[04:21:21] <Riviera> did not really strike me as often enough to talk about bots counting strikes and banning on a defined amount etc.
[04:21:28] <tirnanog> I agree.
[04:21:32] <e36freak> fair enough
[04:21:41] <tirnanog> but an anti-flood measure would help.
[04:21:42] <greycat> yeah, I'm inclined to either let ops handle it, or block unregistered users
[04:21:57] <e36freak> it used to be a pairly common occurance on freenode, so just a thought if/when it gets worse
[04:22:01] <pj> I wouldn't do that.  I would make it more of a manual ban from an op sort of thing, if an op feels that the user just isn't listening or doesn't care.
[04:22:07] <tirnanog> not to say that it's necessarily essential.
[04:22:20] <pj> Like I said, all I'm in favor of in that regard is the short auto-quiet.

[11:05:39] <tirnanog> you can simply unset the elements that don't pass your tests.
[11:05:50] <tirnanog> the array will end up with no elements in the case that they are all invalid.

[11:07:32] <hejux> server_names=(srv_us srv_jp srv_cn srv_ca) is something like this ....
[11:07:37] <hejux> https://paste.rs/Wod
[11:07:57] <hejux> what is ${!server_names[@]} ?
[11:08:08] <tirnanog> it expands to the indices rather than the values.
[11:08:23] <hejux> then it is  0 1 2 3 ..
[11:08:27] <tirnanog> yes.
[11:08:44] <tirnanog> so, if you rely on a ref, you need to assign ${server_names[i]} in that case.
[11:08:48] <tirnanog> rather than $i
[11:08:57] <hejux> well. that ... i still need ref ...

[15:32:30] <Soliton> how does this make sense with a single variable?
[15:32:44] <Soliton> you need to have a current and a max value.
[15:32:52] <Patsie> it starts off with 0
[15:32:58] <Patsie> and multiple tests are done
[15:33:03] <Patsie> each similar to this test
[15:33:07] <Soliton> if you have just one value there is nothing to do.
[15:33:08] <geirha> where does exitcode get set?
[15:33:12] <Patsie> some need to set exitcode to 1, some to 2
[15:33:31] <Soliton> based on what?
[15:33:54] <geirha> ah, now I get it
[15:34:03] <Patsie> fine, the whole script is here -> http://ix.io/3GEy
[15:34:18] <Soliton> if you want a max exitcode then you clearly must have a final (max) exit code and a current one.
[15:34:21] <Patsie> I thought you people liked 'terse but consise examples'
[15:34:39] <Patsie> yes, there is
[15:34:49] <Soliton> so see the math above.
[15:34:49] <Patsie> it starts off at 0 and can change along the way
[15:34:58] <Patsie> I just don't want it to change to a lower value than it already is
[15:35:06] <Soliton> exitcode is the max and ec the current value.
[15:35:33] <Patsie> hmyeah, I think I'll stick with my own version for now then
[15:35:51] <Patsie> thanks for the thinking, but that just doesn't seem any more convenient than what I already have
[15:36:28] <Soliton> i would use (( for math.
[15:36:30] <geirha> (( exitcode >= 1 || exitcode = 1 ))
[15:36:47] <Patsie> ok, that could do/work
[15:37:13] <Soliton> it's the same logic you have just inverted.
[15:37:32] <Patsie> yeah, but with (()) instead of [[]] &&
[15:37:47] <Patsie> I'm indifferent to which of those two to use
[15:37:56] <Patsie> if (()) is considered better, I'm willing to use that
[15:38:49] <Patsie> was just hoping for something like a magic bash operator which could do 'minimum or else' or something
[15:39:16] <ormaaj> yeah pasting from x directly into terminal is ugly. i don't think I ever noticed it chopping long lines.
[15:39:44] <emanuele6> by the way, [[ $a -lt 1 ]] is like [[ a -lt 1 ]]

[16:27:07] <wyre> hi guys, I'm not sure why I'm having this write error randomly https://bpa.st/SVKQ
[16:27:35] <wyre> this is the script https://bpa.st/PCIA
[16:29:19] <Soliton> it has nothing to do with the shell. printf gets an error on write so figure out why.
[16:29:44] <Soliton> whatever it is writing to does not like it sometimes.
[16:29:46] <wyre> Soliton, should I use echo? 🤔
[16:30:06] <Soliton> you can use whatever you want. it will end in a write either way.
[16:30:17] <wyre> it's writting /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/period and duty_cycle
[16:30:30] <Soliton> so ask in #linux or so.
[16:30:35] <wyre> Soliton, so sometimes these files aren't writable? 🤔
[16:31:10] <Soliton> no, the shell does the open not printf and the error is on write not on open.
[16:33:02] <selckin> so maybe the period value isn't valid for the original duty cycle, after changing the cycle it accepts the period (purely guessing), or can't change it when not enabled etc
[16:34:22] <selckin> (guess the real question is why does it succeed the 2nd time, since kernel rjected the write to /sys the first time)
[16:35:04] <selckin> which might be in dmesg, and not a bash question

[17:29:59] <SJrX> I have a fairly long bash file that I want to write a completion helper for. The completion is moderately complex and depends on some definitions in the main file. For some reason that might seem silly I decided to change my long bash file to output a new bash file that is the completion logic. I was wondering if this was the best approach and whether I should do all this in the main bash file. The one concern I have is that all my functions,
[17:29:59] <SJrX> I assume go in one name space, and I also need to turn off the script doing anything if it's being run as a completion script. Anyone have any opinions, and/or did this not make sense.

[18:55:11] <wyre> jelly, oh ... that's a good point
[18:55:18] <jelly> maybe you want to set the root password to a literal empty string.
[18:55:21] <Soliton> the idea is to expand to something non-empty no matter what the var is set to. even if it is set to the empty string.
[18:56:32] <wyre> Soliton, and that non-empty thing is 'x', 'string' or 'whatever', right?
[18:56:44] <Soliton> yes, you can pick what you want.
[18:56:48] <wyre> I mean, ... an arbitrary string
[18:56:55] <wyre> with length > 0
[18:57:44] <wyre> but ... actually if variable is unset ... the syntax won't expand ${var+whatever} to 'whatever'

[18:58:13] <Soliton> so that is the part when the test fails as it should.
[18:58:44] <wyre> and what will evaluate -z when that expansion isn't happening because $var is unset? 🤔
[18:59:00] <Soliton> yeah, but that is just confusing.

[19:01:55] <wyre> can I put it inside just like [ "${$1+x}" ] ?
[19:02:04] <Soliton> sure.
[19:02:11] <wyre> thank you guys 😊
[19:02:16] <emanuele6> not like that
[19:02:17] <Soliton> $? and $# are pointless to test that way though.
[19:02:25] <emanuele6>  [ "${1+x}" ]
[19:02:30] <emanuele6> not ${$1+x}
[19:02:31] <Soliton> of sorry yeah.
[19:02:44] <wyre> that won't be evaluated as number 1?
[19:02:56] <Soliton> the parameter name is 1, yes.
[19:03:05] <emanuele6> wyre: does ${var+x} evaluate var to the string var?
[19:03:23] <wyre> hmmm, I see your point 😊

[20:18:04] <rustyshackleford> if I echo $SHELL, its using /bin/zsh
[20:18:12] <Soliton> that is your login shell.
[20:18:26] <Soliton> it has no bearing on the script.
[20:18:48] <phy1729> shells are not interchangable; pick a shell you want your script to run under and specify that in the shebang
[20:18:51] <hejux> emanuele6: how do you explain this test, when `dx` is run, no output of that line of  `alias du`, that means the du used after that test line, is /usr/bin/du
[20:18:57] <hejux> https://paste.rs/aKj
[20:19:09] <Soliton> if you call your script without a shebang the kernel will have no clue what to do and the current shell will figure something out.
[20:19:29] <rustyshackleford> phy1729: don't you usually try to write scripts to be portable?
[20:19:29] <phy1729> Usually that means call the script with /bin/sh and hope for the best
[20:19:40] <rustyshackleford> pretty much. works most of the time
[20:19:47] <rustyshackleford> god I hate shell scripts

[20:22:25] <emanuele6> unalias removes the alias after you call the function, yes

[20:22:45] <hejux> emanuele6: {where dx ; dx ;} | pasters
[20:22:57] <Soliton> fun unpredictable behaviour in your interactive shell.
[20:23:13] <hejux> that is how the content of URL is created
[20:23:47] <Soliton> the point is that messing with aliases in your function does nothing useful.
[20:24:11] <Soliton> it just changes how your shell works after you called the function.
[20:24:27] <KBar> hey. just a quick question (about /etc/profile). why is there a hyphen  here: `if [ "${PS1-}" ]; then`
[20:24:28] <hejux> `where ` expands my functoion. because was lazy ... i just use  {where dx ; dx ;} | pasters for the test
[20:24:28] <Soliton> the function works how it was defined no matter what.
[20:24:57] <Soliton> KBar: probably a workaround for set -u. it does nothing otherwise.

[23:22:21] <wwallace> !tar
[23:22:22] <greybot> tar is an archiver but not the only one. Usually tar is a good choice (e.g. to duplicate an ENTIRE file system), but if you need fine-grained control, find|cpio or find|pax wins
[23:22:33] <wwallace> !scp
[23:22:33] <greybot> "The scp protocol is outdated, inflexible and not readily fixed." <https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.0> If you have problems with scp, stop using it. Consider sftp or rsync, or ssh u@h 'cat > remotefile' < localfile, or tar cf - dir | ssh u@h 'cd /somewhere && tar xf -'
