[17:55:42] <inwit> What would be the best way to get the tags of a thread? I can't seem to find an equivalent function to notmuch-tree-get-tags that works with threads, instead of messages.
[17:56:01] <inwit> I mean inside emacs, sorry.
[18:02:47] <bremner> inwit: there is example code in function notmuch-search-insert-field
[18:05:36] <inwit> Cool, thanks, I was close!!
[18:08:22] <bremner> in this case basically the work is already done in the CLI side. You might find it useful to sometimes to run notmuch search --output=json $query | jq  to see what is there
[18:12:26] <inwit> I see... In the cli I can more generally do --output=tags, but it seems a bit odd to be calling the cli from inside emacs, right? I guess I must do `(tags (plist-get thread-id :tags))`, but then... I don't know how to reference the current thread-id. :-S
[18:12:57] <inwit> Sorry, I think I must do more homework before asking.

[19:35:30] <inwit> As an elisp newbie I have trouble trying out these snippets: how do you wizards try them out? I mean, should I assign the result to a variable and then check it out? Print it to message buffer? Since I have to test them on the notmuch-tree buffer, it's unclear for me how to proceed.
