[02:26:44] <Hunterkll> that was one of the emergency population control measures implemented like, 8 years ago at the very beginning to raise oh shit alarms
[02:27:09] <Haise0> didn't they also "ban" AFK farming to allow more players in servers ?
[02:27:18] <Hunterkll> erm
[02:27:20] <Haise0> like it would kick you after certain time

[02:27:29] <Hunterkll> the idle timeout is going to be removed eventually

[02:27:49] <Hunterkll> it's hilarious
[02:27:54] <Hunterkll> but if you're actually doing actions 
[02:27:58] <Hunterkll> it doesn't apply
[02:28:02] <Hunterkll> they didn't ban jack shit
[02:28:08] <Hunterkll> except turn on the normal pre-expansion release measures early
[02:28:18] <Haise0> oh
[02:28:18] <Haise0> TIL
[02:28:19] <Hunterkll> normally they'd turn on the idle logout timer like two weeks before expansion release
[02:28:23] <Hunterkll> not 4 months in advance
[02:28:29] <Hunterkll> and then turn it off like 2 weeks after 
[02:28:30] <Hunterkll> lol
[02:28:57] <Hunterkll> but just open an NPC interaction, start a craft but actually do nothing, type /hudlayout and sit there, etc

[02:34:56] <Hunterkll> The previous expansion, July 2019, saw a +61% concurrent steam-owner increase 
[02:35:21] <Work-BWMerlin> When installing MSSQL do I need to install the "client tools connectivity"?  Is this what is required to allow a remote SQL workbench to connect?
[02:35:22] <Hunterkll> July 2021 - 58% increaes. Last major content update/patch which wasn't an expansion was in April, which only saw a +19% concurrent increase 
[02:35:32] <Hunterkll> no
[02:35:35] <Hunterkll> that's something entirely differnet
[02:35:41] <Hunterkll> you just install SSMS wherever you're connecting from
[02:35:45] <Hunterkll> it brings whatever it needs
[02:36:35] <xe0n> morn
[02:36:51] <Hunterkll> if you need that feature in your MSSQL instance, whatever product you're supporting will tell you to install it
[02:36:56] <Hunterkll> that's the only time you ever touch it
[02:37:28] <Hunterkll> it's network libraries and communication componetns for stuff you build

[02:52:45] <Hunterkll> and of course, it takes place in akihabara

[07:51:56] <nojeffrey> sup xe0n 
[07:51:57] <xe0n> ummm bit hard to answer when it really depends on what you want to run, there's no set figure lol
[07:52:07] <Hunterkll> yea you just gotta do the math
[07:52:28] <Hunterkll> if all yer gonna do is run traditional style workload VMs then .... *shrug* prolly gonna shoot costs up
[07:52:34] <xe0n> ^
[07:53:52] <Hunterkll> where it gets interesting is if you can convert stuff to things like RDS style databases, VMs that can be turned off when not needed, scalable other service thingies, etc - or maybe, say, the cost increase isn't astronomical, but still more - but you get a whole lot more for what you're paying even if it's a 1:1 mirror image of your workload (say, you know, no hardware maint even though you're paying 5-10% more, no more power/cooling maint, 
[07:53:52] <Hunterkll> etc) 
[07:53:55] <Hunterkll> so .....
[07:54:27] <Hunterkll> easiest way to start is map your current VMs to EC2/Azure instance sizes, compute the monthly cost of running them all as you do now - this is now your baseline AWS/Azure bill.....
[07:54:44] <Hunterkll> then roll all your costs together for your current inhouse setup and figure out your per-VM cost breakdown 
[07:55:09] <Hunterkll> so add in power, cooling, HW purchases/upgrades, service contracts, maybe even licensing, etc... 
[07:56:04] <nojeffrey> Blades/custom built SANs in a DC, ~200 VM's currently ~70 customer apps all running in k8s, postgresql underneith, rabbitmq, memcache, gitlab ci/cd, elasticsearch, etc,
[07:56:30] <Hunterkll> ok that's great i don't care? :P you're the one who has to care about all that
[07:56:41] <xe0n> well calculate all that stuff, get a list of what you want to move, then speak with professional services from AWS about your options
[07:56:42] <nojeffrey> We have one app running as a pilot in AWS, but no traffic on it
[07:57:15] *** Quits: eddiejennings (~eddie@136.55.139.140) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[07:57:23] <nojeffrey> Hard to measure db instance size for largest customers, all indications point to 2-3x what we're currently paying
[07:57:28] <Hunterkll> like say, those customer apps in k8s, could maybe use aws/azure's k8s service and you'd have less management overhead - which is good - and only pay for what you use instead of buying hardware capacity.... postgres same - RDS style DB service.... 
[07:57:41] <nojeffrey> So trying to find other people who have made a similar switch, and shows the true costs
[07:58:06] <nojeffrey> I know ECS vs EKS is giant diff in price
[07:58:15] <Hunterkll> but like I said, easiest way - figure out your 1:1 mirror costs if you just forklifted it into EC2
[07:58:39] <Hunterkll> and what you're *actually* paying for your onprem shit (links, HW refreshes/repairs/contracts, blah blah blah)
[07:58:57] <Hunterkll> for us, one datacenter actually turned out to be more expensive to operate than just 1:1 forklifting it into EC2
[07:59:16] <Hunterkll> overall with EVERYTHING however, it'd be astronomically more expensive to shift everything into EC2/Azure compute
[07:59:32] <Hunterkll> so very, very situational
[07:59:43] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[08:00:04] <xe0n> then take into account what you'll need to do at your on-prem site\dc, i.e. i dunno if aws provide like a errr directroute like azure, but you may need to upgrade your connection, or some infrastructure so you get the experience you're expecting
[08:00:35] <xe0n> something something cross connect?
[08:00:44] <xe0n> i.e our 365\azure traffic goes over directroute
[08:00:52] <Hunterkll> nojeffrey: let's put it this way - we use both Azure compute, EC2, and on-prem datacenters in a huge mix - and our own shit too, which in one sector competes head to head against Azure and AWS for services like compute/openstack/k8s/database shit/etc

[08:01:32] *** Joins: Casteil (~Casteil@user/casteil)
[08:02:21] <Hunterkll> the only real "cut and dry answer" is if you just 1:1 move shit into EC2 as if you were doing it identically to on-prem with all your own self managed VMs to get a cost ballpark.....
[08:02:38] <Hunterkll> then you look at shit and go "what can we move to 'cloud native' functionality" and that's where you start getting cost savings potentially
[08:03:01] <nojeffrey> We currently have a company who have assessed if we should move, and *also* sell us the services to help us migrate, which I think is a conflict of instrest, of course they're gonna say yes
[08:03:21] <xe0n> thats called professional services lol!
[08:03:44] <Hunterkll> eh depends really, like I said, we head to head compete with Azure and AWS directly in a sector by providing services just like they do, and sometimes we quote azure or aws instead of our shit to customers based on needs
[08:03:49] <xe0n> you can always say hey yeah assist us in the move, but we'll manage the subs ourselves\through another provider\whatever if you dont want all eggs in one basket

[08:07:27] <Hunterkll> down to the per-VM level
[08:08:10] <Hunterkll> when you can point at X VM in your entire stack and say "this, out of all our expenses, costs $152/month to run this VM " 
[08:08:17] <Hunterkll> that's when you can really evaluate cloud services properly
[08:09:40] <Hunterkll> basically you need to figure out this -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/on-premises-cost-estimates-of-virtualization/

[08:16:38] <Hunterkll> nah, it OS/2
[08:17:03] <nojeffrey> Hunterkll My manager has done total costs of what we currently pay, can't recall exact figure, but everything points to AWS being way more expensive. I've heard some of the major banks tried to move to cloud, and moved back to private cloud again becuase of cost, also hear of companies who have 1-2 people who's sole job is to reduce cloud computing cost... 
[08:17:21] <Hunterkll> yea, again, it all depends
[08:17:31] <Hunterkll> sometimes the answer is a mix
[08:17:52] <Hunterkll> sometimes you gotta factor in salary amounts you can gain back into budgte after layoffs

[08:28:13] <Beam> Good/bad? Any suggestion on which cloud provider has the best prices and speed?

[08:32:51] <xe0n> shut...them...down?
[08:33:06] <Beam> my question is more of a... is there any cloud providers that don't charge for traffic and has a fair price per tb/month
[08:33:10] <xe0n> probably should stick with the managed services you're getting for backups lol
[08:33:26] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:33:44] <Beam> they want $800/month for 1tb backup
[08:33:49] <Beam> i don't think it's fair
[08:34:12] <Hunterkll> new glacier backup system: sweet its like $200/month for what we need
[08:34:13] <Beam> when i can get a onedrive for $5/month
[08:34:26] <Hunterkll> the one time you have to restore: WHY THE FUCK IS MY AWS BILL $3500 THIS MONTH?!
[08:34:29] <a1> xe0n: those voices are annoying lol
[08:34:35] <Beam> lol
[08:34:58] <Beam> well even aws is cheaper, if i have to restore every 4 months something else is amiss
[08:35:06] <Beam> :D
[08:35:38] <Hunterkll> yes let's disregard the 2-day long restore time
[08:37:41] <a1> wait
[08:37:43] <a1> you guys restore backups?

[08:43:53] <TurkeyGibby> yes, $800/m is a bit high per TB
[08:44:12] <Beam> i'm just looking for good enterprise 3rd party backup solutions, why am i getting attacked?
[08:44:28] <TurkeyGibby> most service providers are going to be ~100-200 mark, but there are limitations on how quick your connection can upload
[08:44:56] <Hunterkll> you're .... not getting attacked?
[08:44:57] <TurkeyGibby> you're not being attacked, you have a lot of experience here in chat, they're asking for good reasons
[08:45:56] <TurkeyGibby> exactly what kind of storage are you looking for, first off?
[08:46:22] <Beam> i'd prefer something i can mount and run my own cron jobs on
[08:46:46] <a1> i've got a server in my server shed i'll lease
[08:47:38] <Hunterkll> TurkeyGibby: i mean, $800/m might not be t oo bad if it's provider managed backups 
[08:47:42] <Hunterkll> using their solution or whatever
[08:47:48] <TurkeyGibby> right
[08:48:01] <TurkeyGibby> I mean, for us, its the cost of an agent+storage
[08:48:11] <TurkeyGibby> I'm trying to get block vs whatever 
[08:48:55] <TurkeyGibby> we do ~$100/TB+licensing 
[08:49:50] <Beam> well anyway it's a dedicated server, and I was planning to have them make an offline image of it that can be restored to a vps quickly if it bites the dust. So aside from that i need weekly backups of websites, database and like i said a couple kvm images
[08:50:27] <TurkeyGibby> there it is-- you need the restore on another machine which adds the cost
[08:50:41] <Beam> they don't charge 800 to hold an image though
[08:50:56] <TurkeyGibby> they charge for the reserved space
[08:51:31] <TurkeyGibby> doesn't matter if you need it now or later, you're still taking resources away from a pie
[08:51:42] <TurkeyGibby> but 800/m is crazy expensive 
[08:51:49] <TurkeyGibby> like, no shit
[08:52:01] <xe0n> i charge $799 if you're interested
[08:52:06] <Beam> ...
[08:52:07] <a1> i'll do 699
[08:52:09] <xe0n> that's a total of $12 savings per year
[08:52:10] <xe0n> nice
[08:52:10] <a1> but that's a black friday deal
[08:52:25] <Beam> you bunch are a helpful lot aren't you :p
[08:52:48] <JollyRgrs> that is very much the truth
[08:52:50] <TurkeyGibby> honestly, Beam, if you just need standard backup storage you can restore from pm me and we can probably work something out

[08:58:22] <csws> beam are you able to send your images off to an s3 compatible provider?
[08:58:27] <csws> backblaze b2 is pretty good
[08:59:03] *** a1 is now known as ekaj
[08:59:06] <TurkeyGibby> there are a ton of s3 providers out there, including what csws mentioned 
[08:59:28] <Beam> yea but haven't found any that don't charge for data transfer which makes it kinda expensive even with their low monthly
[08:59:29] <TurkeyGibby> and s3 usually has MUCH different pricing than standard backups 
[08:59:41] <xe0n> MUCH x2
[09:00:15] <TurkeyGibby> we don't charge for ingress/egress 
[09:00:46] <Beam> i mean i expect to pay for traffic if it's a ton, but there should be a fair amount included not like 100gb as some have
[09:01:05] <SirSceptalot> morning
[09:01:12] <TurkeyGibby> let me rephrase: we don't ever charge for ingress/egress 
[09:01:20] <Hunterkll> right, but it's all in house for you though
[09:01:24] <Hunterkll> not an external provider
[09:01:30] <Hunterkll> and you're not billing cheap ass per-gb rates
[09:01:58] <Beam> what does ingress/egress mean
[09:02:03] <TurkeyGibby> in/out
[09:02:41] <TurkeyGibby> we don't charge for shipping us your data, or retrieving your data 
[09:02:44] <sd> 04<J​4Y> ah the ol' in-out, in-out
[09:03:05] <TurkeyGibby> you be quiet. Where are my 'roo pics @J4Y?
[09:03:15] <Hunterkll> other things to consider too is how you're doing the backups, if they're database/VM aware, if they're handling *that* properly, what the retention time is, etc
[09:03:17] <TurkeyGibby> miss 'em, for real :(
[09:03:18] <Beam> I don't get why some companies can include traffic while some has a steep price
[09:03:52] <sd> 04<J​4Y> @TurkeyGibby: they'll be gone soon. I'm moving onto a greener pasture
[09:03:56] <Hunterkll> like your provider may be billing for "current storage" usage but have like, 90 day retention, which means you're actually using like, 8TB for 700GB of data 
[09:03:57] <Hunterkll> etc
[09:04:09] <TurkeyGibby> Beam: its a different, and weird pricing model based on use. 
[09:04:19] <sd> 04<J​4Y> I'll snap a couple more pics for you soon tho 🙂

[09:05:00] <TurkeyGibby> imma miss the pics/stories 
[09:05:19] <Hunterkll> Beam: think of it this way - if you aren't pushing/retreiving much - the cost per gb being lower can save you money in the long run for services that charge transfer fees
[09:05:37] <Hunterkll> but if you are doing a lot of in/out  - however you do it - then the higher per-GB cost services may make more sense 
[09:05:52] <sd> 04<J​4Y> I'll have to grab a few final ones for you bud 🙂
[09:06:07] <Hunterkll> Think about S3 Glacier - cheap as FUCK per-GB storage monthly, but they bill per-request for example, and storing a single object is *6* put requests on average
[09:06:08] <sd> 04<J​4Y> I'm waiting to grab a shot of them in a big group
[09:06:20] <Beam> yea i get that, i just don't get why some companies seem to be able to offer unlimited traffic. they must have some awesome agreements with their isp
[09:06:27] <Hunterkll> nope
[09:06:39] <Hunterkll> just.... don't expect the same level of performance/service....
[09:06:41] <sd> 04<J​4Y> Beam: they're charged bandwidth > traffic or the price is incorporated into something else
[09:06:49] <sd> 04<J​4Y> yes, also likely overselling
[09:07:13] <Hunterkll> think of it this way - let's say you store 1TB of data in glacier for $4/month
[09:07:22] <Hunterkll> want to restore that data ASAP? $350 one-shot cost 
[09:07:32] <Hunterkll> $100 if you don't mind waiting about 5 hours for your data to become available

[09:17:04] <Beam> backblaze b2 looks interesting
[09:18:06] <Hunterkll> Beam: i mean, for the dedicated servers i use for random bullshit, I pay like $170/mo for a single host, and my provider gives me 1gig/1gig WAN connectivity, and 500GB of backup space included for free on hardware they manage accessible over NFS, FTP/FTPS, and CIFS 
[09:18:08] <Hunterkll> so....
[09:19:42] <Beam> yea that's about what i pay without backup space
[09:20:44] <Hunterkll> I also have a /24 and 3 /27's of IPv4 space that have no additional monthly fees, among other things. And each host is a nice little 64GB ram 6 core xeon box with 4x 960GB SSDs in RAID-10 running ESX 
[09:21:38] <Hunterkll> lets see, upgrading it to 1TB raises the cost to 12 eur/month.... 5TB 40 eur/mo.... and 10TB total would run me 60 eur/mo 
[09:21:40] <Beam> i might actually rent a cheap vps off them as a backup server, and rsync to it regularly
[09:21:48] <csws> lol
[09:21:55] <Hunterkll> yea that VPS is gonna get nuked for AUP violations

[09:23:35] <Hunterkll> something like 97% of their fleet doesn't even use AC for cooling, just watercooled 
[09:23:36] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:23:56] <Hunterkll> they're like, the largest host/datacenter operator in the world at this point
[09:24:05] <csws> if only they could direct it to pop like a water balloon when the next fire happens
[09:24:30] <Beam> Hunterkll: what part of that would be against an aup?
[09:24:48] <Hunterkll> Beam: well, i suppose you could throttle the transfer speed to slow as balls.... 
[09:24:59] <TurkeyGibby> Hunterkll: are they though? I can think of several private DCs that are much larger
[09:25:11] <Hunterkll> but yea, with OVH id' probably chose their veeam service at $14/month/VM
[09:25:18] <Hunterkll> instead of using an NFS mount and rolling my own shit 
[09:25:34] <Beam> firstly content on server is fairly static, maybe only 5gb of changes weekly, and it's inhouse traffic so why would they mind
[09:25:36] <yuken> hmm.
[09:25:46] <yuken> I need some copper 16 AWG wire, let's see what prices are like on Amazon...
[09:25:57] <Hunterkll> Beam: because those "cheap VPS" systems are often standalone hosts with limited disk allocations, and often on 1gig uplinks, etc
[09:26:04] <Hunterkll> so you could be crushing all the other customers sharing that box lol
[09:26:11] <Hunterkll> among many other things that can go ... interesting
[09:26:28] <Hunterkll> and 5gb of changes weekly? your VMs will require full backups every time unless you go in on a proper backup solution ..... 
[09:26:30] <csws> Beam: if you're backing up websites then maybe something like borgbackup would be more appropriate. it uses rsync but does compression and incremental changes. borgbase is a decent managed provider
[09:26:51] <sd> 04<J​4Y> backing up vms is so 2010 anyway
[09:26:51] <csws> but borgbackup isn't for backing VM images up, just the content in them
[09:26:52] <yuken> Beam, just do all your backups on laserdisc.

[09:27:05] <Hunterkll> TurkeyGibby: I mean, 30+ DCs with a gigantic ass network

[09:27:22] <TurkeyGibby> 30 is childsplay

[09:27:30] <csws> last job had like 60!
[09:27:32] <Hunterkll> they're no akamai but still
[09:27:36] <csws> and we had DCs in third world countries!
[09:27:45] <csws> oh wait.. datacentres?
[09:27:49] <Hunterkll> yes
[09:27:50] <csws> still thinking domain controllers
[09:27:53] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:28:28] <TurkeyGibby> DRT has 280 locations
[09:28:32] <Hunterkll> I mean, Microsoft's sitting around 40-50 datacenters iirc 
[09:28:35] <TurkeyGibby> want me to look at Equinix? 
[09:28:43] <csws> doesn't MS use equinix for some locations tho?
[09:29:13] <TurkeyGibby> MS uses equinix, DRT and their own DCs
[09:29:58] <Hunterkll> I suppose the other thing to point out is OVH's stuff could all be considered "in house" not renting out space

[09:32:16] <Hunterkll> Beam: be aware that if you use something like that - mounting S3 as a filesystem (instead of maybe using EBS) you're going to be using S3 standard, not S3 glacier, so amplify your storage costs appropriately

[09:54:07] <Hunterkll> Beam: like I said, there's a lot of red flags there in terms of reliability/operations wise

[09:57:57] <e1> lttstore.com
[09:58:23] <Hunterkll> for the services
[09:58:44] <Hunterkll> their generic "company wide" TOS is easy enough to find .... at the bottom of the page.... as a really tiny link...
[09:59:09] <Beam> Hunterkll: ok thanks
[09:59:54] <Hunterkll> lolwut
[09:59:56] <Hunterkll> "A single account is limited to 400,000 inodes at any given time."
[09:59:58] <Hunterkll> pffff
[10:00:14] <Hunterkll> "E-mail such as junk mail should be permanently deleted."
[10:00:18] <Hunterkll> why is that even in the TOS
[10:00:31] <e1> maybe they're hosting some mailboxes for you
[10:00:36] <e1> and saw what you send
[10:00:41] <Hunterkll> lol....
[10:01:00] <Hunterkll> Examples of unacceptable content include, but are not limited to the following: Pirated software, Hacker programs or archives, illegal audio files or archives.
[10:01:21] <Beam> Hunterkll: rsync.net has unlimited traffic it seems though, isn't that to be considered a red flag in terms of speed limits?
[10:01:29] <csws> do they ban IRC in the ToS too?
[10:01:54] <Hunterkll> csws: IRC servers, at any rate
[10:02:00] <Hunterkll> so don't buy a VPS from them and expect to be able to do that
[10:02:01] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:02:23] <Hunterkll> Beam: right, but the thing is -they're a company *solely* dedicated to providing this type of st orage/operation 
[10:02:25] <e1> @Pikachu I'm just saying, if we ever wanted a way to have someone else pay us to fuck around with zfs.. rsync.net is a good business to rip off
[10:02:47] <Hunterkll> there's something to be had for specialization 
[10:02:59] <Beam> Hunterkll: i guess, i'll trial them for sure
[10:02:59] <Hunterkll> nevermind the fact that they have no problem with taking on multi-petabyte customers routinely
[10:03:39] <Hunterkll> e1: they do n't have an AU location, just 3x US sites and germany and hong kong 
[10:03:42] <Hunterkll> so go for it
[10:03:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:04:07] <Hunterkll> Beam: that, and they'll actually help you with your backup software and scripting and shit 
[10:04:33] <e1> It's times like this I think
[10:04:38] <e1> Man, I wish there was a secret IRC
[10:04:43] <e1> oh wait, there is!
[10:04:53] <Hunterkll> they'll sign HIPAA BAAs, provide all sorts of regulatory checkbox answers you need for whatever reason, etc
[10:05:04] <Hunterkll> because literally all they do is provide storage
[10:05:06] <Hunterkll> nothing else
[10:05:06] <Beam> Hunterkll: and you're probably right about interserver :p i'm in chat with them, and they seem unable to answer *ANY* technical question that isn't already stated on the website :p probably some indian callcenter doing support
[10:05:09] <e1> how do i ban a username on irc

[10:08:22] <JollyRgrs> well, parts/joins for users who haven't been active
[10:08:27] <JollyRgrs> the active ones, i still get
[10:08:47] <Hunterkll> Beam: and as well    note that, rsync.net's ToS is basically "don't do illegal shit, you're responsible for your ssh keys not getting stolen, and don't do something that'll take our shit down like ddos us "
[10:08:54] <e1> Saves me from talking to empty air, warns me about imminent autism and lets me celebrate when the autism leaves
[10:09:09] <Hunterkll> instead of "YOU CANT DO THIS YOU CANT DO THAT AND ESPECIALLY YOU CAN TDO ANY OF THESE LEGAL THINGS BECAUSE WE'RE SCARED AND OUR NETWORK IS FRAGILE"
[10:09:27] <Hunterkll> like interserver's ban on IRC servers? Explicitly because they can't handle even a small DDoS attack
[10:09:38] <e1> Can you?
[10:09:46] <Hunterkll> e1: better than australia can 
[10:09:58] <Hunterkll> i'm surprised no one's tried to ddos australia offline just for sport
[10:10:02] <e1> i mean even that's not saying much
[10:10:11] <Beam> Hunterkll: well rsync.net is annoying in the fact that the order system is really basic, and they don't have any live support except phone
[10:10:12] <JollyRgrs> they like their roo pictures too much

[10:12:26] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:12:39] <e1> but that's bordering political discussion because nbnco might as well be run by retar.. I mean our government.

[10:23:41] <fritzwastaken> Spirited Thief is a tactical stealth game with a quirk: take your time to scout and plan your heist, then break in to steal pricey gems under increasing pressure.
[10:24:30] <fritzwastaken> ive been play testing it and providing bug/feedback reports constantly because the dev is part of a gaming group im in

[10:27:24] <fritzwastaken> Back to binding of isaac
[10:27:31] * fritzwastaken lurks
[10:28:58] <fritzwastaken> Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
[10:29:00] <fritzwastaken> Life was simple, and they were both happy.
[10:29:02] <fritzwastaken> That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: "Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!"
[10:29:40] <fritzwastaken> "I will do my best to save him, my Lord," Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.
[10:29:42] <fritzwastaken> Again, the voice called to her:
[10:29:44] <fritzwastaken> "Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins."
[10:29:46] <fritzwastaken> "I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee," Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.
[10:29:48] <fritzwastaken> One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
[10:29:51] <fritzwastaken> "You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you."
[10:29:52] <fritzwastaken> "Yes, Lord. Anything," Isaac's mother begged.
[10:29:54] <fritzwastaken> "To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!"
[10:29:56] <fritzwastaken> "Yes, Lord," she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
[10:29:58] <fritzwastaken> Isaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.

[10:43:43] <Hunterkll> but yes, rsync.net i've been using for around 15 years or so. the only limitations they have on how to use the service is you can't do illegal shit (no fucking duh) with zero limitations on how you utilize the service
[10:44:56] <JollyRgrs> i mean, HW is almost 20 yrs newer than 2003 expected, csws 
[10:45:16] <csws> yeah we just moved these VMs to fancy new hosts
[10:45:17] <yuken> hm, let's see. I have $200 to feed myself for 3-4 weeks. That's doable.
[10:45:25] <Hunterkll> mount it and use it for your bittorrent seedbox storage? no problem. Host your website out of it on a mountpoint? No problem. Run your databases off that mountpoint? No problem.
[10:45:27] <yuken> I got rice and beans, $200 is plenty for chicken and some greens.
[10:45:34] <Hunterkll> run a VM out of it? No problem

[10:45:45] <Hunterkll> it'd be.... stupid to do so but *shrug* it's allowed

[12:09:17] <JollyRgrs> @VALOS well, next time don't be so rude, I didn't hear the magic word
[12:09:42] <Rpifan> I mean if I had some cute 19 year old student at least they'd be fun to look at I suppose 
[12:10:15] <JollyRgrs> Rpifan: at my old job, we took on some interns for helpdesk with the hope/promise that we'd teach them the ropes of helldesk (Who would want to do that? lol)... but all along the plan was just to use them to stick thumb drives in workstations and upgrade from XP to W7
[12:10:26] <Rpifan> The value of young people is there curiosity so I can see the benefit for the intern but for the company they'll just try to get him to work overtime non stop for as little as possible 
[12:10:27] <JollyRgrs> i felt really bad
[12:10:43] <JollyRgrs> they had to do x many hours for their degree, so we helped them with that
[12:10:53] <JollyRgrs> but half were like ITT Tech bad (legit, they were from ITT Tech)

[12:13:29] <Rpifan> I mean im sure having a good intern can be fun and rewarding for both ppl 
[12:13:36] <JollyRgrs> internships are normally non-paid... but you can use that as a trial time to see if they are worth hiring after their internship... being they are entry level with no experience (other than the internship) you can almost definitely pay them bottom of the pay grade for that position and they'll take it
[12:13:50] <JollyRgrs> other internships are paid, tho
[12:14:03] <JollyRgrs> my sister got paid by IBM and TI when she did internships with them over the summers

[12:14:39] <Rpifan> Speaking of IBM I was drinking wiht ibm ppl last night. Apparently it's quite horrible at IBM 
[12:15:26] <JollyRgrs> they have been trying to "Come back" ever since the "ibm compatible" machines came out
[12:16:30] <JollyRgrs> they went uber extreme to build watson and their Z series stuff... but they got nothing inbetween (source: they started selling off their workstations and do they even make x86 servers anymore?
[12:17:45] <Rpifan> Yea 
[12:19:18] <Rpifan> I was just thinking about that why isn't my medical data being reviewed by IBM watson already

[13:06:53] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> After hearing *this morning* that they don't want me to just secure end devices but the network as well

[13:07:44] <SirSceptalot> that sounds... eh.. impossible?

[13:08:57] <SirSceptalot> morning Activ8 
[13:09:07] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> SirSceptalot: Might be, we'll see. It is a contained network with only one way in and out so it's not *too* much to secure
[13:09:40] <Activ8> morning SirSceptalot
[13:09:56] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> There was also a risk of SSH access into one of the end devices but I've got that locked down
[13:09:56] <Activ8> I just woke up, got a fried egg sandwich n onion
[13:10:08] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> So now it's pretty much just proper segmentation and firewalling and we're good

[13:10:23] <SirSceptalot> Activ8, great, that made me realise that I'm hungry

[13:10:58] <Activ8> ah all good then lancehead :)
[13:10:59] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> They have some stuff in the field that is secured but they had me do an audit of it essentially
[13:11:36] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> I think you were here when I talked about it, it's those RPi's that go in refueling stations
[13:11:36] <Activ8> don't make it too tight lol I had that issue when I took over a network when a guy left, his documentation was shockingly bad and I had to deal with the network on full lockdown
[13:11:59] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Yeah I'm writing an advice report, they're going to pick what they eventually want me to implement
[13:12:12] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> I'm basically just putting all the options on paper in technical terms and they pick and choose
[13:12:18] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Since they know the environment a little better than I do

[13:15:09] <Activ8> that
[13:15:30] <Activ8> that's a nice little project that, from an outsider you are wanting to improve the network with valid reason
[13:15:45] <Activ8> and not just implementing something because "of the sake of it"
[13:15:58] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Yeah, it's pretty important stuff as well
[13:16:14] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> They're hydrogen refueling stations so if they do get breached it's absolutely fucking catastrophic

[13:17:03] <Activ8> nice to see welcome changes in tech
[13:18:21] <Hunterkll> could be harder
[13:18:27] <Hunterkll> you could be trying to secure video game infrastructure
[13:18:28] <Hunterkll> XD

[13:20:01] <Activ8> for been a small MSP that is...
[13:20:03] <Hunterkll> i know a few people in that kinda work and they're sitting on some saucy stuff too in terms of like
[13:20:07] <Hunterkll> game console exploits and shit

[13:20:44] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Aw man, putting the networking stuff in this document is gonna fuck my entire formatting ;-;
[13:20:55] <Hunterkll> fun having a little show and tell over dinner "check out this MFA bypass I found in X" "check out this buffer overflow on 'non-vulnerable' nintendo switches!" :P
[13:20:57] <Activ8> just change the formatting to make it work then
[13:21:11] <Activ8> they will be under NDA though Hunterkll surely?
[13:21:18] <Hunterkll> Activ8: that's just personal interest shit
[13:21:22] <Hunterkll> not work-related shit
[13:21:24] <Activ8> oh
[13:21:34] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Pretty sure getting it to look nice again is gonna cost me more effort than mentioning VLANing and proper firewalling
[13:21:39] <Hunterkll> like yakkin on about exploit chains and random defcon shit and stuff we do for fun 
[13:21:42] <Activ8> well you can get an emulator for the switch now.  Switch games play on PC
[13:21:49] <Activ8> you need a good system though but they work
[13:21:58] <Hunterkll> Activ8: yea but that doesnt help me run fluxbox on my switch better
[13:21:58] <Hunterkll> :P
[13:22:18] <Hunterkll> though my MFA bypass is still in talks with the vendor about resolution paths like almost a year and a half later
[13:22:18] <Activ8> just means you don't need to buy a switch to play the games
[13:22:22] <Activ8> but shhhh
[13:22:25] <Hunterkll> haven't tried it on Windows 11 yet 
[13:22:40] <Activ8> my PC isn't fast enough for the better games but the basic platform games work great
[13:23:05] <Hunterkll> but yea i got the splatoon edition switch a while back so it's one of the perma-hard vulnerable ones
[13:23:08] <Hunterkll> so i'm pretty happy about that
[13:23:22] <Activ8> I have to implement MFA in a company next week, we have chosen a 2x phones and then putting authy for windows on 5 systems in the company.
[13:23:39] <Activ8> There's 50 staff so when they need a MFA code they need to go to one of the 5 people
[13:23:51] <Activ8> and requests are logged
[13:24:08] <Hunterkll> only MFA i'd trust on windows is smartcards, period. Hello for business once set up is a damn close second though because it essentially is smart card auth, just using the TPM instead of a usb token or card 
[13:24:18] <Hunterkll> everything else ..... well
[13:24:21] <Activ8> the company doesn't have the systems for windows hello
[13:24:30] <Hunterkll> no AAD/InTune?
[13:24:34] <Activ8> we need to implement something so this is what they have chosen
[13:24:47] <Hunterkll> dont really need onpremmy stuff 
[13:24:48] <Hunterkll> but meh
[13:24:53] <Activ8> AD internal yes but no intune e.t.c
[13:25:03] <Activ8> they don't have cameras on the systems
[13:25:11] <Hunterkll> Activ8: so just use pin login 
[13:25:11] <Activ8> and this company is on low budget
[13:25:12] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:25:19] <Hunterkll> don't need cameras or fingerprint readers
[13:25:29] <Activ8> for windows hello?
[13:25:33] <Hunterkll> yes
[13:25:37] <Activ8> that's face auth though ?
[13:25:40] <Hunterkll> no....
[13:25:52] <Activ8> huh
[13:25:59] <Hunterkll> pin, picture swipy bullshit, face, fingerprint, etc....
[13:26:26] <Activ8> oh nah they would never implement that stuff yet
[13:26:42] <Hunterkll> i'm saying you can use any of those
[13:26:45] <Activ8> yeh
[13:27:05] <Hunterkll> so imagine instead of plugging in a smart card, the card's your built in TPM, and you just type your pin instead of password to log in, and that's your entire MFA solution for accessing all your corporate shit
[13:27:06] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:27:10] <Activ8> MFA is for all sites though not just standard logins
[13:27:15] <Hunterkll> right
[13:27:18] <Hunterkll> SSO via AAD :)
[13:27:31] <Activ8> it's been explored 
[13:27:59] <Hunterkll> or ADFS 
[13:28:01] <Hunterkll> if you don't have AAD
[13:28:10] <Activ8> on their 0365 that will be turned on next week 
[13:28:20] <Activ8> as in MFA
[13:28:28] <Activ8> plenty options
[13:28:31] <Hunterkll> oh so you do have AAD
[13:28:33] <Hunterkll> probably AD synced
[13:28:37] <Hunterkll> you practically have everything you need
[13:33:01] <Activ8> nah 0365 is separate to their AD infrastructure
[13:35:24] <Hunterkll> ..... so you have separate logins and passwords for computers and for O365 ?

[13:36:52] <Activ8> at the moment yes
[13:37:00] <Hunterkll> that's.... insanely dumb
[13:37:01] <Activ8> don't you forget we don't just look after 1 company....
[13:37:06] <Hunterkll> eh
[13:37:27] <Activ8> we don't get a say on what the customer wants, it's all up to them we just recommend
[13:37:52] <Activ8> the customers get a choice we don't argue with them we just tell them what we can implement at what cost.
[13:38:24] <Activ8> when a customer wants something it's not up to us what they choose
[13:38:50] <Activ8> I think a lot of you people forget that in here.
[13:39:40] <Activ8> some of our customers have SSO, Azure, 0365 windows hello already but that's because they have a budget for that stuff
[13:40:27] <Activ8> we are bound to budget constraints, politics and angry bosses lol
[13:40:53] <Activ8> We do NOTHING without the say of the company for obv reasons.
[13:41:32] <Hunterkll> I mean, if you have O365 and on prem AD.... why not even just go and install AD connect on the damn DC ... it's free lol
[13:42:28] <Hunterkll> so's azure AD for that matter
[13:42:59] <Activ8> because the choice isn't up to us, we do have ad connect on some of the systems
[13:43:39] <Hunterkll> i mean i definitely get that but i just don't get "oh we can do this free thing to make life easier"
[13:43:43] <Hunterkll> "nah lets not"
[13:43:44] <Hunterkll> idea
[13:43:55] <Activ8> well it won't be free will it
[13:44:10] <Activ8> they still need to pay for implementation and time and some of them didn't want to pay
[13:44:10] <Hunterkll> okay a few hours labor i guess for one engineer, lol
[13:44:31] <Activ8> I understand that but the businesses not bothered about what works and what doesn't they try to save money where possible
[13:44:48] <Activ8> I know what SHOULD be done but we are in a real world where budgets are tight and these are small companies
[13:44:54] <Hunterkll> i mean on your side too it's good for you
[13:45:02] <Hunterkll> mor support labor billing
[13:45:10] <Activ8> it's good for us if they want that option and pay yes lol
[13:45:21] <Hunterkll> no i mean if they keep it separate 
[13:45:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:45:36] <Activ8> we have payment plans in place for some of them.  Some companies pay monthly for what we have done
[13:45:49] <Activ8> well at the end of the day it's not up to us
[13:46:07] <Activ8> we can just suggest, and invoice it's up to them when it comes to a yes or a no
[13:46:09] <Hunterkll> oh yea i know in the dark ages i worked for MSP too 
[13:46:27] <Activ8> we have went back to companies and put in things we suggested when they have a new budget
[13:46:32] <Hunterkll> i'm just saying for your company, that's more support that customer will need, so more revenue from them over time
[13:46:45] <Activ8> from that point of view yes we let them pay ad-hoc
[13:47:08] <Activ8> put it this way we must be doing something right we are getting enough income to keep the company afloat so far
[13:47:14] <Hunterkll> for the ones that go without things like ad connect etc
[13:47:15] <Activ8> profits are climbing
[13:47:17] <Hunterkll> right
[13:47:24] <Hunterkll> customers like the one you are talking about are helping that :P

[13:48:07] <Activ8> don't get us wrong we suggest to companies what is best practice but when they turn around n say "nah we not going to pay that" they usually go get another quote then come back to us
[13:48:37] <Activ8> the amount of times we won quotes is well over 5 pages size 8 text size lol
[13:50:32] <Hunterkll> 'k, you dont wanna pay 2 hrs labor now, thats fine' 
[13:50:39] <Hunterkll> end of year: how did we get charged 150 hours support labor
[13:50:52] <xe0n> they need the money so they can take the hit when software prices increase, they don't want to to pass em onto their customers
[13:51:09] <xe0n> they're happy working at a loss, he said it the other night
[13:51:27] <Activ8> I never said we didn't want to pass it onto customers I said we are in discussion weather or not to absorb the cost for couple months
[13:51:31] <Activ8> read your scroll back
[13:51:53] <xe0n> ..or give them a couple of months heads up...so they can prepare
[13:52:09] <Activ8> it's been extended until june so it doesn't matter
[13:55:07] <Activ8> another thing most of our customers pay year by year not monthly so their cost doesn't change it's just the 20% for the pay monthly customers

[14:04:22] <rpifan> i saw what you sent me yesterday about connecting the two
[14:04:26] <Hunterkll> sync to.... what
[14:04:32] <rpifan> but that seems dangerous and complicated. just for user creation
[14:04:44] <rpifan> i mean creat the user either in azure and / or in gapps
[14:04:50] <rpifan> and then have the user appear in the other service
[14:04:57] <Hunterkll> log into the thing, then click create, and you're done...?
[14:05:03] <Hunterkll> like....
[14:05:10] <rpifan> atm we are making an account in gapps and then going into azure and making another acocunt
[14:05:10] * DoTheNeedful throws punches
[14:05:18] <rpifan> and hten going to zoom to make an account and then doing it again for slack

[14:05:37] <Hunterkll> anyway
[14:06:09] <Hunterkll> so make aad account, gapps account is set up, then with saml auth you authenticate to aad and it automatically signs you into gapps

[14:08:38] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> I do; I'm willing to bet you don't even fucking know where I live lmao
[14:08:44] <xe0n> oO
[14:08:44] <rpifan> at least the person im taking over is an HR person so everything is very well documented with steps and such
[14:08:58] <rpifan> but its all done in word documents so its documented but not accesible
[14:09:06] <rpifan> hopefully ill migrate the data to the wiki
[14:09:39] <Hunterkll> lancehead, those are the kind of network and security people the industry kind of despises
[14:09:40] <xe0n> then one thing you could suggest for continious improvement is something like confluence for the documentation
[14:10:00] <Activ8> xe0n I’m just messing, enjoy your beer ☺️
[14:10:03] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> What do you mean, Hunterkll?
[14:11:06] <rpifan> yea this wiki thing is a big topic
[14:11:08] <rpifan> but for later
[14:11:14] <rpifan> atm the expectation for my job are low
[14:11:27] <rpifan> make user accounts answer questions as to why users headphones arent working
[14:12:08] <rpifan> apparently they randomly stopped working but on closer inspection i noticied the headphone jack of the laptop had a small crack in it
[14:12:21] <rpifan> im sure that crack happened by magic, totally not that the user dropped the laptop
[14:13:39] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> lol that reminds me, we have a laptop here that we use for testing that has a HUGE dent in the lid because someone accidentally dropped their aluminum thermos on it
[14:13:49] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Still works, it just has a crater
[14:14:25] <Activ8> People don’t take care of kit when it’s not their own
[14:14:25] <rpifan> lol
[14:15:16] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> I don't think that's a fair assumption, Activ8; accidents happen. You just get more of them when you have more people with company hardware so they become more noticeable
[14:16:29] <rpifan> i break my own personal shit all the time
[14:17:24] <Activ8> I’ve seen my fair share of people abusing kit in the workplace
[14:17:51] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Well yeah it'll happen
[14:17:58] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> But I think most people do at least try to be careful
[14:18:04] <rpifan> a bit annoying that zoom doesnt support gsuite integration for user management
[14:18:15] <rpifan> i dont even know why we are using zoom in the first place
[14:18:20] <rpifan> shitty service
[14:18:25] <xe0n> imagine if you used exchange and teams with your azure subscription...

[14:31:53] <Hunterkll> @Lancehead well, my favorites are infosec degree holders first and foremost - without that bout of sysadmin and/or helpdesk experience and a super junior role for a bit, they come straight outta school with a degree, land a decent paying job, and make dumb ass decisions and/or total nonsensical shit that yes, in "theory" is correct but doesn't actually mesh with the real world, or weakens other areas as a side effect, etc
[14:32:20] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Oh yeah I see what you mean
[14:32:31] <Hunterkll> basically, if you ahve an infosec degree + a year or two job exp, then you'll have a great leg up, but if you've got 2 years decent infosec exp without a degree vs the 4 year degree holder with no experience
[14:32:41] <Hunterkll> well, i can tell you who's going to do better on the interview and in the job :P
[14:32:55] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> People tend to be hired straight out of education here, but managed closely
[14:32:58] <Hunterkll> same applies to other fields of study too of course 
[14:33:24] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Companies do tend to see that coming here, fortunately
[14:33:39] <xe0n> yeah in low-level L1 positions, you aint walking out of school and getting yourself a senior or high level position with zero real world experience
[14:33:59] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Oh yeah for sure
[14:34:09] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> That doesn't automatically equate to "you're going to a helpdesk" though
[14:34:20] <xe0n> what do you think is typically the entry point?
[14:34:22] <xe0n> ...
[14:34:30] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> Here? Not that
[14:34:34] <sd> 08<L​ancehead> We have separate educations for that
[14:34:35] <Hunterkll> eh no, but you might be the fuckin whitelisting app analyst who makes my life hell because you thi nk you know better and deny shit that on paper makes sense but .,..
[14:34:38] <Hunterkll> and i'm talkin like
[14:34:40] <DrZak> helldesk drone
[14:34:41] <Hunterkll> jr level positions, front line
[14:34:43] <rpifan> well in germany sysadmin work is helldesk
[14:34:46] <Hunterkll> what's essentially helpdesk in that department
[14:34:47] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:34:53] <DrZak> wat
[14:34:54] <DrZak> :DD
[14:35:00] <rpifan> all of the sysadmin advertised roles in berlin at least are literally helpdesk + 
[14:35:03] <Hunterkll> rpifan: but yes that MS link I gave you earlier, you set that up in AAD and Gsuite, you only have to make the account in AAD and it automatically creates it in gsuite and keeps it synchronized between the two 
[14:35:06] <rpifan> some kind of management type
[14:35:11] <DrZak> helpdesk is helpdesk, sysadmins are 2nd or 3rd line
[14:35:23] <Hunterkll> 2nd or 3rd line wut
[14:35:30] <rpifan> well in all the german companies ive been so far its all combined into one single role
[14:35:35] <DrZak> and then there are solution architects
[14:35:47] <rpifan> so like now im the l1 l2 l3 guy
[14:35:57] <Hunterkll> thats small business shit
[14:35:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:35:58] <DrZak> you are barely helpdesk
[14:36:07] <rpifan> plus im also taking decisions about the wider infrastructure 
[14:36:12] <rpifan> well medium business
[14:36:16] <rpifan> which is the only place ive worked 
[14:36:24] <rpifan> and i dont wnana go big corporate jobs anyway
[14:36:48] <Hunterkll> rpifan: then, once you have AAD automaking the g suite accounts 
[14:36:54] <Hunterkll> rpifan: you can set this up in zoom - https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363003-Quick-start-guide-for-SSO
[14:37:07] <Hunterkll> when a user first logs into zoom using your domain account, it automatically creates the zoom account
[14:37:10] <Hunterkll> no work on your part needed
[14:37:11] <rpifan> yea for now im just gonna do stuff by hand to get it out of the way
[14:37:14] <Hunterkll> other than maybe assigning a license
[14:37:17] <rpifan> then next month ill read all the articles at least
[14:37:24] <xe0n> smart move rpifan
[14:37:28] <DrZak> :))
[14:37:31] <Hunterkll> at that point now you just make an account in AAD, then G Suite and Zoom are covered
[14:37:37] <Hunterkll> well, that's the future you can look to
[14:37:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:37:40] <DrZak> this gets funnier 
[14:37:47] <rpifan> yea we arent giving out licensed account except for a very small handful of people
[14:38:07] <Hunterkll> yea so you set the default to free lic, and everyone logs in free, and you just upgrade whoever gets paid after they log in first time
[14:38:08] <Hunterkll> no big deal
[14:38:30] <DrZak> the unfortunate situation is, once he figures it out, they will fire him and relace him with a 4line script
[14:38:34] <rpifan> the spiders job was shitty but i learnt a lot about what not to do 
[14:38:34] <rpifan> lol
[14:38:40] <Hunterkll> this shit seems complex because it is 
[14:38:42] <rpifan> DrZak, loool
[14:38:48] <Hunterkll> but when you break it down, it's really just one piece at a time
[14:38:57] <rpifan> i cant laugh to hard im doing the remote working from the coffee shop
[14:39:01] <rpifan> real hardcore IT shit here
[14:39:24] <Hunterkll> AAD automaking gsuite accounts with password synchronized  (forget even SSO here) - there's one task out of the way, and user now only has to remember one password for all that
[14:39:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:39:32] <xe0n> how have you wrangled that on your first week lol
[14:39:36] <xe0n> loll
[14:39:40] <Hunterkll> xe0n: germany having covid spikes
[14:39:40] <DrZak> yea, getting funnier and funnier
[14:39:41] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:39:46] <xe0n> ah
[14:39:58] <DrZak> oh ye, there's a 5 year jail sentence for hardcore idiots with covid rules
[14:40:01] <DrZak> in germany
[14:40:09] <DrZak> erm, its under consideration
[14:40:11] <DrZak> not yet approved
[14:40:11] <xe0n> yeah our regulations kick in dec 17th
[14:40:19] <Hunterkll> lol

[14:40:29] <Hunterkll> haha
[14:41:07] <DrZak> well, its for idiots who dont respect the rules, but there's no lockdown per se
[14:41:23] <Hunterkll> oh no i'm talking about aussie stuff
[14:41:34] <DrZak> o i c

[15:12:58] <Cl0udNinja> question, has anyone heard of a company doing a 'market pay leveling', where they basically find the average based on your title/responsibilities, and if you're under it, you get bumped up?
[15:13:19] <xe0n> that's called the award system here
[15:13:43] <Hunterkll> pfff
[15:13:49] <Hunterkll> i've heard of them bumping people down for moving 
[15:13:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:13:54] <Rpifan> Hm
[15:14:26] <Cl0udNinja> we had a meeting today, and they mentioned they were doing a market pay level, and wouldnt be dropping off any pay if you move states
[15:14:47] <Cl0udNinja> but you also wouldnt get an increase if you move to a more expensive place
[15:15:31] <Cl0udNinja> never heard of a place doin the first one, at all, ever, so that it was pretty cool/weird.
[15:16:31] <Hunterkll> yea thats kinda nice
[15:16:40] <Hunterkll> maybe they realized they were grossly underpaying or something
[15:16:41] <Hunterkll> LOL

[19:43:55] <AnimalFarmPig> @b​denlinger -- as far as I can see, pg_dump should be dumb, just telling the server to emit the CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements for the relevant data. The actual SQL should be generated on the server side, so the client software shouldn't need to care. If there's a breaking compatibility change in the API for asking the server to generate the SQL, fine, fail then, but I doubt that's the case here

[20:59:40] <sd> 14<K​orhaka> There is literally nothing we can do, its related to databases and some file on the server, both of which we have zero access to.

[21:01:17] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> There's a fine balance, especially when there is no updates to give for a few hours. Usually something boilerplate like "We are continuing to work on the issue."
[21:01:50] <sd> 12<S​obia> I've found clients really like the hourly updates. It lets them know you haven't forgotten about them and are still actively doing *something* even if there's no update (so this covers your ass in this regards), and it allows them to also cover their ass when their bosses or employees ask what's going on.

[21:03:08] <int0x1C8> you can get DoB from age depending on precision

[21:03:13] <PublicWiFi> TurkeyGibby: expense reports are the worst!
[21:03:31] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: you're an expense report
[21:03:42] <Hunterkll> also I actually kinda like our system
[21:04:24] <Hunterkll> imports the transactions, you mark off what they are, they pay the stuff they're supposed to pay directly to the card (airfare, hotel, transportation) and put the regular cut perdiem in your paycheck and you pay off the rest of the card balance directly 
[21:04:28] <int0x1C8> what does bomb disposal have to do with any of this?
[21:04:32] <TurkeyGibby> PublicWiFi: ours are pretty easy. Just the basic deets, and a receipt, shit is auto-approved  
[21:04:59] <Hunterkll> and since airfare/hotel are all booked through the system anyway no receipts or anything for that stuff 
[21:05:06] <sd> 14<K​orhaka> Not sure what we actually count as, the guy who does 2nd line used to do the same stuff as us, we just do what was his job minus the database we don't have access to
[21:05:13] <TurkeyGibby> like, I submitted ~7k worth of shit from defcon, half of which I didn't have a receipt with, and they approved it
[21:05:15] <Hunterkll> only need receipts/justification if there's any unexpected/unplanned expenses above and beyond 
[21:05:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:05:51] <Hunterkll> like say if i have to run to a few stores to pick up tools or something, that's when i'd need a receipt, but meals and shit, it's just a straight daily rate paid out to me regardless of how much or little i spend 
[21:05:58] <Hunterkll> can't be like gibby where they'll pick up all the tabs
[21:06:04] <TurkeyGibby> and when we're out taking clients to places where its $200-$300 a meal per person, no one really bats an eye

[21:08:45] <int0x1C8> a while ago I happened to be digging around in our HR folder on the shared drive (at the request of HR to find a file they thought was lost) and stumbled upon some pretty serious disciplinary records related to an employee's misuse of his company card and expense reporting
[21:09:25] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: at least it wasn't someone producing porn on their company issued laptop with evidence saved
[21:09:26] <Hunterkll> :P

[21:10:26] <Hunterkll> yea dont be editing home made porn on your company laptop 
[21:10:29] <Hunterkll> or so the tale goes
[21:10:50] <int0x1C8> I think he had charged over $1000 in personal expenses to the card, can't remember details, but I was surprised as hell he wasn't immediately fired
[21:11:05] <Hunterkll> yeeesh
[21:11:48] <int0x1C8> it was a final written warning, so he went right to strike 3, but didn't get fired
[21:11:51] <Hunterkll> yea our cards you can get into a  LOT of trouble with real fast if you're dumb, but the way the system works is it kinda is like.... well, because of like the per diem being issued via paycheck and shit, it's whatever as long as you've paid the balance on time (Revolving amex charge card, not credit card) 
[21:12:12] <Hunterkll> but i think my daily cash withdrawl limit is like $10k or something absurd 
[21:12:24] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Yea those revolving AMEX cards got some sweeeeet rewards
[21:12:31] <AnimalFarmPig> <arlion> and tofurkey is nasty   <---- man, I miss torfurkey. I'm not even a vegetarian, but I like it. I had it every thanksgiving (and sometimes just for fun) for years in the US, and then I moved abroad, and it doesn't exist
[21:12:58] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> We did Christmas gifts to employees every year on rewards.
[21:13:18] <int0x1C8> I think he did that back when expense reporting was still completely manual, so it was easy to fudge
[21:13:26] <Hunterkll> ahh
[21:13:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Some folks got airline tickets and stuff. Kind of a yankee swap sort deal.
[21:14:18] <Hunterkll> yea for reimbursable stuff, it just pulls the transactions, you select which ones to put on the report, they pay the standard shit (hotel/travel/transport) to the card directly, then give you the $XX/day non-tax via paycheck flat rate and you pay the remaining shit off yourself if you're not claiming specific reimbursement
[21:14:24] <int0x1C8> now it's automated in reporting services, pulls transactions from each card, itemizes them, and sends the report to A/P
[21:14:43] <Hunterkll> i've used the wrong card by accident before for a plane ticket b/c of autofill and accounting was like "doesnt matter as long as the balance is paid lol"
[21:15:23] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Yea current company is like that. Pretty lame to pay for service to do that when you used to get AMEX rewards but it probably becomes impossible with big corp and 10k cards.
[21:15:32] *** Quits: bloody (~bloody@user/bloody) (Quit: Always focus on how far you've come, rather than how far you have left to go)
[21:15:36] <mjt> you're brave putting a company card in autofill
[21:15:46] <Hunterkll> mjt: work laptop, work accounts
[21:15:47] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:15:56] <Hunterkll> i think it's more 'brave putting a personal card in autofill' at that point
[21:16:05] <Hunterkll> and them both being amexes with similar numbers at the end
[21:16:23] <Rpifan> I'm gonna get an work credit card 
[21:16:26] <int0x1C8> but we still have to print out the report and fill in what the purchases were and reasons, and include receipts/invoices for each of them
[21:16:29] <Rpifan> I wonder what my budget will be 
[21:16:34] <mjt> speaking of autofill I discovered today edge doesn't use end to end encryption for sync on consumer tier
[21:16:38] <Rpifan> And will they really just entrust me with money 
[21:16:39] <mjt> What sort of bullshit is that
[21:16:49] <Hunterkll> @bdenlinger yea the card has fucking absurd limits, but it's also  kind of like meant to be a clutch "oh we're all in a datacenter because major issue and need to get X people here right the fuck now and can't reach someone" type shit  
[21:17:19] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Similar but we were putting hotels and shit on it. 4 rooms for 2 weeks can get pretty expensive.
[21:17:29] <Hunterkll> yea i mean that's what i use m ine for
[21:17:30] <int0x1C8> apparently we tried to fully automate it, but the A/P person objected for whatever reason old people resist changes to manual paper processes :|
[21:17:35] <Hunterkll> travel, conventions, corporate events, etc
[21:17:37] <JollyRgrs> Rpifan: normally, there might be some "limit" on your spending with a company CC, but mostly, it'll be just putting in expense reports to account for what you spent
[21:17:38] <Hunterkll> normally anyway
[21:17:59] <Hunterkll> but yea like cash limit is like $10k, god knows what the fucking charge limit is
[21:18:18] <yuken> I can feel it

[21:19:42] <JollyRgrs> whether for better or worse
[21:19:42] <Hunterkll> for any purchase under $500 he was the only approval needed
[21:19:45] <int0x1C8> I'd be super apprehensive about DIY vapes
[21:19:51] <Hunterkll> for reimburisng ya 
[21:20:07] <Activ8> I wouldn't vape regardless the amount of chemicals in them
[21:20:12] <Hunterkll> and we had a good relatinoship with the distributor 
[21:20:15] <Activ8> 15/20 years time they will find a problem
[21:20:15] <yuken> int0x1C8, I'm most likely not going to blow myself up. Using a proper resistor for my wire rating and wattage, a good off-the-shelf BMS, and so on.
[21:20:21] <Hunterkll> so when he got the XPS 13 (the flip screen one) whwen it first came out
[21:20:24] <yuken> I'm making sure it's safe.
[21:20:34] <Hunterkll> he got an upgraded SSD and because of our vendor relationship, the vendor knocked the SSD price down to $499.99 
[21:20:35] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:20:38] <Hunterkll> for a one off
[21:20:42] <JollyRgrs> yuken: vaping is not safe
[21:20:43] <Hunterkll> so he could get it for his new toy
[21:20:51] <Rpifan> We got spendex
[21:21:02] <JollyRgrs> vaping is (at least for what we see now) better than smoking a cigarette
[21:21:14] <JollyRgrs> but that's about as far as that goes, it should be used as a tool to ween off of nicotine
[21:21:31] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: i have this odd feeling it's not going to be used for nicotine based substances
[21:21:38] <yuken> JollyRgrs, I'm aware. And ultimately, I'd rather enjoy limited time on Earth than live extra-long with my already failing body.

[21:21:57] <yuken> JollyRgrs, my body is going to be shot by the time I'm 50-60 anyway, and I might assisted suicide after that if I can't find alternatives.

[21:22:19] <Hunterkll> fuckin battery exploded right?
[21:22:29] <int0x1C8> no the cartridge itself did
[21:22:30] <yuken> Was it some unregulated mod with no overdischarge protector?
[21:22:37] <JollyRgrs> yuken: well, hopefully we won't have to put it in the topic, but pls no discussion about suicide in here
[21:22:54] <Hunterkll> hmmm
[21:22:57] <yuken> JollyRgrs, fine :P. But my body will be basically dead in the next 40 years, most likely, unless I'm very very sedentary.
[21:22:58] <Hunterkll> what to get for lunch...
[21:23:06] <yuken> I already have basically no cartilage in my knees.
[21:23:09] <shakygator> mcrib
[21:23:13] <mjt> That's one way to get around the blood brain barrier
[21:23:21] <JollyRgrs> yuken: just 3d print/DIY some new knees
[21:23:21] <yuken> so I might as well eat my red meat and vape my juice.

[21:23:28] <Hunterkll> shakygator: my doordash order history for the past week or two says i might want to change that idea
[21:23:29] <Hunterkll> lol

[21:24:00] <Hunterkll> lets see
[21:24:15] <Hunterkll> 11 since the 8th
[21:24:22] <Hunterkll> so average 1 a day 
[21:24:28] <JollyRgrs> whatever yuken, your call, i'm not your mother. IMO i've never even had the desire for smoking (nicotine or thc) or any other drugs... but that's just me. you do you, but i doubt vaping is going to "change your world"
[21:24:31] <shakygator> dang i need to go get one
[21:24:42] <JollyRgrs> unless you have some chronic illness where it helps take the edge off of the pain or something
[21:24:48] <Hunterkll> yea once i saw it on the men u i was like wtf this changes everything
[21:24:54] <yuken> JollyRgrs, nah, it won't, just a fun experience with friends. I don't really want to do any of this alone, or extremely often.

[21:25:29] <yuken> JollyRgrs, I did some edibles alone once, and don't really have any interest in it alone again, just seems pointless unless it's to kill pain.
[21:25:47] <yuken> But get together with friends and listen to some music, play vidya games, orgy, etc is all good.
[21:27:06] <JollyRgrs> i can have just as much fun playing video games w/o it. same with listening to music
[21:27:41] <JollyRgrs> and orgy... well, you gotta find others willing to participate first, lol

[21:28:56] <Hunterkll> you hear stories... horrible stories... ab out what furries get up to
[21:29:01] <JollyRgrs> i mean... do you really wanna get with that group tho?
[21:29:02] <yuken> JollyRgrs, but yeah no, I don't want every single interaction with my friend group to rely on alcohol/weed/etc, but doing it every once in a while is a fun experience.
[21:29:03] <Hunterkll> i'm sure the'll take yuken under wing just fine

[22:44:56] <sd> 04<p​huzion> See, if you're gonna say something like that, have something to back up your bullshit. I'd argue EST is a superior timezone to CST because more economic activity occurs in EST than (possibly) any other timezone in the world.
[22:45:22] <Activ8> Hunterkll sometimes I contact them and ask if they are horny
[22:45:26] <Activ8> not had a reply yet

[22:49:05] <PublicWiFi> also @phuzion is really fired up about a timezone lol

[22:56:35] <PublicWiFi> gonna try to go home early today
[22:56:39] <PublicWiFi> since i gotta work tomorrow :(
[22:57:18] <Hunterkll> eh
[22:57:29] <Hunterkll> i'd argue PST might have a sheer level of economic activity that could rival it though 
[22:57:41] <Hunterkll> being california by itself is the 5th largest economy in the world - just the one state by itself
[22:58:01] <phuzion> Yeah but think of the economic activity in NYC.
[22:58:27] <phuzion> 73 of the F500 are HQ'd in NYC.
[22:58:58] <PublicWiFi> NY state has 1/3 the economy of california I think
[22:59:19] <PublicWiFi> california is rich af haha
