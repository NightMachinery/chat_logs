[00:05:40] <Slade> with these 'wizard'/'sequence' style displays, i also find myself to just be making state machine after state machine to determine what to render, lots of boilerplate.  wonder if there is a cleaner way to do that
[00:05:51] <Slade> 1 master state machine :P

[01:33:51] <jellobot> harpia, A function declaration `function declared() {}` & a function expression e.g. `var bar = function expressed() {}`: the former is !hoisted, the latter can be immediately invoked (see !iife) and can be anonymous (eg can omit the name "expressed"). "function" as the first word of a statement at global scope or directly inside a function starts a function declaration; otherwise, it starts a function expression.

[03:07:16] <chazy> i can see the float number in console, the problem is when it's returned
[03:07:40] <stenno> line 6 will not do what you think it does
[03:07:52] <stenno> but yeah it should return 0
[03:08:05] <chazy> that's why i see 0
[03:08:14] <chazy> what's the problem?
[03:08:40] <stenno> the return statement in line 6 will return from the each callback, it will not return from getBalanceFunction
[03:08:59] <stenno> you actually want to use .find here
[03:09:25] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[03:10:15] <stenno> so you .find the token where token_address === tokenAddress. If its undefined (i.e. not found), return 0. otherwise return the parseFloat call
[03:10:57] <stenno> the callback of forEach is always assumed to be undefined, and your linter should throw here
[03:11:07] <stenno> maybe someone else can explain it a bit better
[03:11:19] <stenno> the callback return*
[03:13:01] <chazy> what about creating a variable outside the foreach, setting it inside and returning when it's found? and then return the promise?

[03:13:26] <systemfault> chazy: That's a lot of work to not use .find...
[03:13:27] <stenno> what you want here is .find
[03:14:01] <chazy> oh find instead of foreach?
[03:14:04] <stenno> yes
[03:14:11] <chazy> yea that makes more sense
[03:14:13] <stenno> like:
[03:15:51] <stenno> const balance = Moralis...; const token = balance.find((token) => token.token_address === tokenAddress); if (token === undefined) { return 0; } return Number.parseFloat(...);
[03:16:13] <stenno> first statement needs an `await`

[06:48:22] <Rockwood> ljharb, i am bit confuse about implement in index.js context stuff
[06:48:52] <Intelo> ljharb any thoughts on automating interview process with no human intervention?
[06:49:03] <Intelo> at least for the first steps
[06:49:25] <ljharb> Intelo: thoughts are that it’s a bad idea
[06:49:29] <ljharb> Rockwood: how so
[06:49:49] <Intelo> ljharb am.. got 100s of resumes. can't screen all manually
[06:50:12] <ljharb> sure you can
[06:50:24] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/4b57228c2b90c649641027dc54f686cc ljharb
[06:50:26] <ljharb> it should take like, a day or two to do some quick triage
[06:50:56] <Rockwood> so now i have to make provider here (i means in index.js)
[06:51:11] <ljharb> Rockwood: i suppose you could have your first render be a loading spinner, and then wait until you’ve fetched the session
[06:51:26] <Intelo> I get engaged for an hour per candidate. at least 15 minutes. so multiple 15 mins to 300 candidates at least <- we are talking
[06:51:26] <ljharb> Rockwood: but usually your backend sets something in the html, and you read it here
[06:51:33] <Intelo> ljharb ^
[06:51:37] <ljharb> Intelo: screening resumes involves no talking
[06:51:42] <ljharb> Intelo: you just read them
[06:51:50] <Intelo> ljharb I just stopped looking at resumes.... most lie
[06:51:59] <ljharb> then why ask for one in the first place
[06:52:10] <ljharb> either trust it, or don’t bother asking
[06:52:11] <Intelo> just to get phone /email :)
[06:52:19] <ljharb> then ask for only that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:52:37] <Intelo> well, people apply with resume and resume has contact details. I use that for interviewing
[06:52:43] <Rockwood> ljharb, in my index.js is not any component yet
[06:52:50] <Intelo> resume is archived etiher way ljharb
[06:53:00] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:53:15] <ljharb> but also, 15 min at 300 candidates is 75 hours, which is 9 days for one person. Quite reasonable.

[06:53:53] <ljharb> Intelo: the way it’s done is to hire recruiters
[06:54:09] * Intelo trying to do something different and more efficient
[06:54:14] <ljharb> Intelo: what’s not scalable is trying to automate entry to the most expensive thing your company will ever have: employees

[06:54:20] <ljharb> you can’t

[07:14:25] <iamtheworstdev> "f every person on the planet generates a new UUID4 every second, we’d expect a collision to occur after about 10 years."

[08:07:22] <gde33> Intelo: you divide some code you need written into discreet tasks. Divide the tasks over the applicants, upload the results into some testing environment (which could be part of the tasks) assign each task to multiple applicants if you need. And then you pay everyone who produced a working chunk of code.
[08:08:17] <gde33> that should get rid of 80%
[08:09:58] <gde33> then you hire the one who submitted ellegantly formatted working code and has the worse resume
[08:11:14] <Intelo> gde33 that is surely a good thought. Enlighten me more on length and size of those tasks? I am making a saas web app
[08:11:27] <Intelo> react, pg, ts,node is the stack
[08:11:46] <gde33> that is left as an exercise for you :)
[08:11:52] <Intelo> gde33 so in your opinion, no interview process? just the task?
[08:11:59] <Intelo> gde33 ok that is interesting too
[08:12:04] <gde33> word press use to just give whatever is in the bug tracker from what I understand
[08:12:16] <Intelo> what? wordpress?
[08:12:21] <gde33> Intelo: fuck the interview and the resume bullshit?
[08:12:22] <Intelo> i didn't got your last comment
[08:12:31] <gde33> do it like in the old days, just start working already
[08:12:32] <Intelo> gde33 ok but how to test the person?
[08:12:39] <gde33> give them work to do
[08:12:44] <gde33> pay them if it looks good
[08:12:48] <Intelo> gde33 ok, wait, how much time investment per candidate should I expect (from him)
[08:13:08] <Intelo> gde33 brilliant. no one gave this idea
[08:13:09] <gde33> doesn't matter if you pay them?
[08:13:18] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[08:13:24] <gde33> you can give one a task for a few hours and the next guy one for a week?
[08:13:34] <Intelo> gde33 well they won't have the confidence that I or anyone would pay
[08:13:35] <gde33> if they produce nothing you pay nothing?
[08:13:52] <Intelo> next guy?
[08:14:09] <Intelo> gde33 if they produce nothing or shitty. no pay I guess. fair?
[08:14:10] <gde33> its a job interview? getting paid is icing on the cake
[08:14:20] <gde33> its just to show you are not an asshole
[08:14:38] <Intelo> gde33 ya agreed but the fine line between "interview time" and "working/ long project"
[08:14:52] <gde33> the wp guy I chat with said that they don't hear anything from 80%
[08:14:59] <Intelo> these are nitty details. I agree with the concept anywa
[08:15:05] <gde33> some are supper late
[08:15:17] <Intelo> 'don't hear anythign from 80%'?
[08:15:18] <gde33> they will just get less money I guess?
[08:15:29] <gde33> they don't have what it takes
[08:15:50] <gde33> they have to do it at home, be self motivating etc
[08:16:12] <Intelo> I see
[08:16:22] <gde33> I imagine many of those would be reasonable coders if you put them in a cubical and baby sit them
[08:16:25] <Intelo> so you have done this before?
[08:16:51] <gde33> no
[08:16:56] <Intelo> how many hours of a task should it be at minimum to max?
[08:16:59] <gde33> but it seems awesome to me
[08:17:09] <Intelo> seems like an 'interview project'
[08:17:11] <gde33> whatever the task is I suppose?
[08:17:15] <gde33> not all tasks are equal
[08:17:49] <gde33> if you want to make it truly briliant you let the applicants figure out the specs for the process and code it for you :P
[08:18:00] <Intelo> gde33 if I think about it as a developer. I would think "hm.. what max time I can spare for this interview? most probably there would be others doing the same and I fear my efforts might not get wasted"
[08:18:03] <gde33> should be interesting?

[08:51:19] <Intelo> gde33 back. I think the main concern the interviewees would have is the legitimacy of the company and their time spent in assignment to go in vain. ie company just trying to get work done for free (unless we pay all interviewees as advance payments)
[08:52:00] <gde33> Intelo: have to create some kind of track record
[08:53:27] <Intelo> gde33 like?
[08:53:42] <gde33> a history of applicants paid
[08:54:55] <gde33> just have people do real work, any employer can chose not to pay end of the first month
[08:55:08] <gde33> few would do the legal process to get that money
[08:55:29] <gde33> working for free for 1 day is a great way to find a job

[09:36:54] <Intelo> rustyshackleford the root question was  so you absolutely disagree to do initial screening with coding algorithms in an interview?
[09:36:54] <rustyshackleford> but I think you can get a lot out of just talking about their previous projects
[09:37:12] <rustyshackleford> no
[09:37:28] <Intelo> rustyshackleford yes but the question even before that was how to have unattended interviews/ screening
[09:37:35] <Intelo> like 100% automatted
[09:37:39] <Intelo> and scalable
[09:37:53] <Intelo> I have invested a lot of time interviewing and now backing off being frustrated
[09:37:57] <rustyshackleford> throw out all of the resumes that don't have all of the keywords
[09:38:21] <Intelo> rustyshackleford actually people put.. all the keywords here even if they just know the name
[09:38:23] <rustyshackleford> just skim them, and start interviewing people that stand out at first glance
[09:38:39] <Intelo> I stopped reviewing resumes except to get contact details

[09:39:48] <Intelo> wanted to

[09:39:58] <rustyshackleford> and nope, this one is definitely going in the trash
[09:40:12] <Intelo> ya
[09:40:32] <rustyshackleford> contact all of your definitely yes resumes
[09:40:43] <rustyshackleford> then work through your maybe pile until positions are filled

[09:41:55] <rustyshackleford> Intelo: as far as algorithms. I would pick a problem/puzzle and see how they attack it
[09:41:59] <Intelo> whats the notion behind it neshpion?
[09:42:16] <Intelo> rustyshackleford that will be live interview? <-- dont want it
[09:42:26] <rustyshackleford> algorithms questions are kind of like, did you memorize it or did you not?
[09:42:27] <neshpion> they applied for the job because they want to work there, so just let them
[09:42:32] <Intelo> rustyshackleford or at least want it without my intervention
[09:42:58] <rustyshackleford> I bet you could do it virtually
[09:43:01] <rustyshackleford> with a screen share
[09:43:13] <Intelo> that will 'engag'e me
[09:43:24] <Intelo> not non-blocking async
[09:43:37] <rustyshackleford> or give them a puzzle, and walk through the code afterwards. And you could say, well what's the runtime complexity of this function
[09:43:58] <rustyshackleford> could we do better (given more time to solve the puzzle), or is this optimal
[09:44:54] <Intelo> ok..

[13:24:13] <OnkelTem> Hi folks
[13:24:28] <OnkelTem> I wonder where does npm now install things if launched in an empty directory?
[13:25:00] <OnkelTem> Before iiric it created a dummy package.json but I could also find node_modules dir. Now - it's just empty
[13:25:16] <OnkelTem> erm... just isn't created

[13:28:24] <silly> not empty here...
[13:29:18] <Decker> silly then it's line one is a property in the prototype, the other is a value on the object itself; not sure how you ended up setting one without updating the other
[13:30:35] <OnkelTem> silly: I'm on 7.21.0
[13:30:43] <OnkelTem> yours?
[13:30:49] <silly> Decker, i've  entered two line in the browser js console
[13:30:57] <silly> OnkelTem, 8.1.4
[13:31:25] <OnkelTem> thanks. Strange. If I create a dummy package.json myself - then everything is installed normally

[15:44:29] <CoolerX> Hi
[15:44:51] <CoolerX> Aren't touch events automatically converted to mouse events so that websites continue work correctly on mobile?
[15:44:55] <CoolerX> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events
[15:45:09] <CoolerX> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Supporting_both_TouchEvent_and_MouseEvent
[15:45:25] <CoolerX> "However, the reality is the vast majority of today's web content is designed only to work with mouse input. Consequently, even if a browser supports touch, the browser must still emulate mouse events so content that assumes mouse-only input will work as is without direct modification.
[15:45:30] <CoolerX> "
[15:45:45] <CoolerX> For some reason it doesn't seem to be doing that
[15:46:12] <CoolerX> on Android 11 chrome, I am trying to draw on a canvas and nothing happens
[15:47:09] <CoolerX> do I really need to add touchstart, touchmove and touchend event listeners?
[15:48:06] <stenno> yes
[15:49:20] <CoolerX> actually I added some console.log and it seems like the mouse events are being fired
[15:49:29] <CoolerX> on mobile
[15:49:34] <CoolerX> hmm
[15:49:46] <stenno> touchmove is different than mousemove
[15:50:11] <stenno> touchmove is like mousemove when you have the mouse button pressed

Unfortunately, if I apply container.style.transform = "scale(2)" I obtain a blurry image for the PDF inside it. How can I fix this? I'm getting crazy with this! Thanks!!
