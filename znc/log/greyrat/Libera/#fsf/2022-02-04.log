[03:55:56] <Kaiod> An example of this type (although bad) is Tails which does this on a USB stick, which is where I intend to do mine.
[03:55:56] <Kaiod> I can install it on the USB stick, no problem.

[05:34:58] <tpefreedom> What's bad about trisquel 10? I'm curious since I have not tried it yet.
[05:35:20] <iShareFreedom> for my, is more slow and have a little bugs for my computer

[08:04:01] <iShareFreedom> if you have amdgpu they go to force your instalation to install malware.
[08:04:18] <iShareFreedom> aka nonfree software in blobs
[08:04:21] <DiffieHellman> labrador: I compile things with -march=native and -O3, so binary distros just feel slow 
[08:04:25] <labrador> iShareFreedom, not really I had to go and install all my blobs manually thank you
[08:04:44] <labrador> DiffieHellman, I'd rather not compile things...my computer is too slow
[08:04:47] *** Quits: xiews (~wxie@116.232.33.53) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:04:51] <iShareFreedom> the only distros you can install and share with ethic and morality are the free distros.
[08:04:54] <DiffieHellman> iShareFreedom: Don't install amdgpu then? That's the only way for amdgpu to work and they say that. Use radeonsi instead
[08:05:11] <iShareFreedom> i dont install nonfree software
[08:05:26] <iShareFreedom> im in a free distro, and im completly against all nonfree software
[08:05:45] <labrador> sure do that but realize you need compromises irl
[08:05:59] <iShareFreedom> compromises what
[08:06:33] <labrador> of using more mainstream distros...of running blobs...etc
[08:06:54] <iShareFreedom> you are sharing the ideas about nonfree software as a good idea to do with your example

[08:07:24] <DiffieHellman> How so when I'm expressily noting that there is temptation that must be resisted?
[08:07:36] <labrador> Well I think free OS w/ blobs > Proprietary OS
[08:07:39] <labrador> So yes
[08:07:44] <tpefreedom> What about installing lfs (without any nonfree software)? (Should be glfs)
[08:07:49] <iShareFreedom> you cant have a free distro with blobs
[08:08:07] <labrador> People will run back to windows if linux cannot even run their machine to its full capablitity
[08:08:08] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Same thing, but there are levels of proprietary.
[08:08:15] <tpefreedom> labrador, and a free OS w/o blobbc > free OS w/ blobs
[08:08:16] <iShareFreedom> the only ones free distros are: https://gnu.org/distros
[08:08:34] <DiffieHellman> It's better to be 1% proprietary than 100% proprietary, but the target is 0%
[08:08:35] <labrador> Like not have wifi..or a display...or bluetooth etc
[08:08:51] <DiffieHellman> labrador: *GNU/Linux
[08:09:11] <iShareFreedom> dont correct him
[08:09:12] <Andrew> labrador: My computer doesn't run gnu/linux on full capability
[08:09:18] <iShareFreedom> he dont want freedom, he want wifi
[08:09:23] <Andrew> But I never considered switching back to windows
[08:09:34] <iShareFreedom> that is what he want, and im not against him and his ideas, about for me that are bad
[08:09:36] <labrador> tpefreedom, sure but security is important too...you'll drive away security researchers when you do not allow microcode updates
[08:09:49] <labrador> Or firmware updates etc
[08:09:53] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Eh, microcode updates are pretty much useless.
[08:09:57] <iShareFreedom> all nonfree software are malware
[08:10:00] <iShareFreedom> or possible malware
[08:10:08] <iShareFreedom> so you cant have security with him
[08:10:11] <labrador> DiffieHellman, na they patch up stuff like spectre and meltdown
[08:10:13] <DiffieHellman> Any processor vulns aren't an issue if you only run free softare
[08:10:32] <labrador> DiffieHellman, not really...go say that to a sec guy and see what response you get lol
[08:10:42] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary software are likey to use spectre and meltdown, good free software won't.
[08:11:04] <AwesomeAdam54321> labrador: When it comes to Wifi, a wireless USB adapter can be used: https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usb
[08:11:18] <labrador> Nothing says that free software can't be malware
[08:11:43] <iShareFreedom> free software dont have warranty so, of your free distro is part of a community, or you make your own support or you dont have support
[08:11:52] <DiffieHellman> labrador: It can be, but in that case, you installed malware34 and that's exactly what you asked.
[08:12:04] <iShareFreedom> or the other option labrador, is pay to others to make support to you
[08:12:06] <DiffieHellman> 3>He doesn't read the source of every program you use.
[08:12:09] <labrador> iShareFreedom, yes and debian literally is the largest distro
[08:12:18] <labrador> It has about 60k packages in its repos
[08:12:28] <iShareFreedom> debian is nonfree distro
[08:12:28] <labrador> So you'll get everything you need
[08:12:36] <labrador> iShareFreedom, also the largest one...
[08:12:37] <iShareFreedom> all i need is freedom
[08:12:46] <iShareFreedom> wifi?
[08:12:49] <iShareFreedom> haha!
[08:12:54] <labrador> iShareFreedom, people need a working computer lol
[08:12:57] <DiffieHellman> I'll take both freedom and speed.
[08:13:02] <iShareFreedom> people deserve freedom 
[08:13:07] <iShareFreedom> more than work
[08:13:26] <labrador> Uhh most people won't agree with you iShareFreedom on your assessment of what they need
[08:13:45] <iShareFreedom> if you are agree with my ideas arent important
[08:13:48] <iShareFreedom> for me or for others
[08:14:03] <iShareFreedom> my ideals are completly about moral and ethic way about using your computer
[08:14:06] <DiffieHellman> Most won't, but you need to expressily inform that x needs y piece of proprietary malware and z computer needs to be bought to solve that issue.
[08:14:26] <iShareFreedom> if you want use your computer with malware, you can do it, you can sell your freedom, but that is somethingi dont recommend.
[08:14:33] <iShareFreedom> something*
[08:14:44] <labrador> DiffieHellman, and debian does that,it isn't installed by default so you need to read the kernel logs and see what needs to be installed
[08:14:45] <DiffieHellman> Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[08:14:50] <labrador> Thats information enough
[08:14:59] <iShareFreedom> Pureos is the directly replacement to debian
[08:15:07] <iShareFreedom> becouse debian arent a free distro
[08:15:26] <DiffieHellman> Linux by default doesn't seem to have any proprietary firmware within anymore, but it does have a bunch of drivers that are only useful with that.
[08:15:47] <iShareFreedom> the kernel isnt the only one problem of debian
[08:15:47] <DiffieHellman> Your own make menuconfig tailored for your hardware solves that though.
[08:15:53] <iShareFreedom> debian support, share and recommend malware
[08:16:17] *** Quits: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[08:16:19] <iShareFreedom> Free distributions (or “distros”) of the GNU/Linux system only include and only propose free software. They reject nonfree applications, nonfree programming platforms, nonfree drivers, nonfree firmware “blobs,” and any other nonfree software and documentation. If they discover that by mistake some had been included, they remove it. 
[08:16:33] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, then do note that it's unofficcial, but you are correct that they don't say that it's malware enough.
[08:16:36] <tpefreedom> iShareFreedom, a LOT of people dislike GNOME, so pureos might not be the best recommendation
[08:16:43] <iShareFreedom> pureos have kde too
[08:16:52] <iShareFreedom> if you want mate you have trisquel
[08:16:53] <labrador> GNOME is cool
[08:17:00] <tpefreedom> I'm personally not all that invested but GNOME is quite polarizing
[08:17:21] <iShareFreedom> if you want more options like without systemd you can install parabola
[08:17:26] <iShareFreedom> or hyperbola
[08:17:37] <tpefreedom> or guix
[08:17:50] <iShareFreedom> yes but gnu guix is for advanced users
[08:17:55] <labrador> Or just use artix I guess
[08:18:04] <labrador> Its a binary distro without systemd
[08:18:04] <iShareFreedom> lol
[08:18:09] <Andrew> labrador: Nah, use parabola if you can
[08:18:17] <tpefreedom> Well hypeerbola and parabola are not exactly inviting to new users either
[08:18:20] <Andrew> Artix, but free
[08:18:26] <DiffieHellman> I tried out Guix, but that's not up to scratch - for mupdf it automatically installs mujs, which only usage is running proprieatry JavaScript in pdf's
[08:18:26] <Andrew> tpefreedom: Neither is artix
[08:18:39] <iShareFreedom> hyperbola & parabola are more user friendly than gnu guix
[08:18:43] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: That's right, but I can live without a pdf reader
[08:19:03] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: It depends on your background
[08:19:09] <Andrew> If you are a Lisper/Schemer, you'd find Guix much easier
[08:19:10] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: mupdf can be compiled without JavaScript support just fine, Guix doesn't provide that option - meanwhile Gentoo does.
[08:19:21] <Andrew> Of course gentoo does [tm]
[08:19:25] <iShareFreedom> im speaking about user friendly Andrew
[08:19:45] <labrador> The easiest distros would be mint or something
[08:19:48] <iShareFreedom> no for about advanced users
[08:19:49] <labrador> Or elementary OS
[08:19:56] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: Again, it depends on the user's background
[08:19:57] <iShareFreedom> lol
[08:20:01] <DiffieHellman> Isn't mint nonfree out of the box?
[08:20:06] <labrador> yes
[08:20:07] <Andrew> labrador: I find chicken-csi and ghci to be friendly
[08:20:08] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Yes, it is
[08:20:09] <iShareFreedom> stop sharing and promotion malware labrador, please
[08:20:35] <Andrew> Lets see if there's any projects that wanna make mint free
[08:20:37] <iShareFreedom> here is the fsf chat, you dont feel the ideals about free software movement? xD
[08:20:45] <Andrew> Ugh, let me get myself unbanned on my own IRC network first.
[08:20:50] <iShareFreedom> the mint replacement is Trisquel
[08:20:56] <iShareFreedom> the Ubuntu replacement is Trisquel
[08:21:10] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: Not exactly
[08:21:15] <iShareFreedom> ok dude
[08:21:18] <Andrew> You don't get all the newbie applications with Mint
[08:21:18] <iShareFreedom> you are troling
[08:21:29] <iShareFreedom> im against mint
[08:21:30] <tpefreedom> Uruk GNU/Linux is also in the middle of certification iirc
[08:21:33] <Andrew> lol "trol(l)ing"
[08:21:35] <iShareFreedom> im just promotion real free distros.
[08:21:36] <Andrew> Uruk? Hmm
[08:21:48] <iShareFreedom> im completly against nonfree distros
[08:21:54] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: I'm not promoting Mint, I'm talking about what free distros who target newbies need
[08:21:55] <labrador> Its so easy(mint) becuz it 'just werks'
[08:21:59] <labrador> And that requires blobs
[08:22:03] <Andrew> No
[08:22:13] <iShareFreedom> the most new users distro are Trisquel and PureOS

[08:22:29] <labrador> Andrew, not if your wifi doesn't work...

[08:22:40] <labrador> Who doesn't understand
[08:22:43] <iShareFreedom> buy a ethernet cable
[08:22:46] <Andrew> labrador: I helped people replace WiFi cards before
[08:22:50] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Just write a free software firmware implementation, easy
[08:23:03] <DiffieHellman> iShareFreedom: Ethernet is a protocol you know? Did you mean cat6 UTP?
[08:23:05] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Not exactly easy when the specs are nowhere
[08:23:24] <iShareFreedom> isnt important for me the technical issue
[08:23:27] <labrador> DiffieHellman, first go tell that guy he needs to do that and see what he does to you :D
[08:23:59] <DiffieHellman> labrador: They'd probably beg me to do it and I just might.
[08:24:10] <iShareFreedom> ok now i see
[08:24:16] <DiffieHellman> Anyone know of any non-stupid 802.11n implementation?
[08:24:17] <iShareFreedom> with people like labdrador
[08:24:27] <iShareFreedom> this fsf chat looks a debian chat 
[08:24:31] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: No
[08:24:31] <DiffieHellman> *implementations
[08:24:31] <iShareFreedom> xd
[08:24:54] <labrador> iShareFreedom, its just an easy distro
[08:24:56] <DiffieHellman> I have a look at that IEEE 802.11n-2009 spec and I say the 500 pages and closed it.
[08:25:01] <labrador> You don't have to run debian

[08:25:02] <iShareFreedom> labrador
[08:25:05] <iShareFreedom> i go to block you
[08:25:09] <labrador> You could run fedora or something
[08:25:10] <iShareFreedom> im bored about your promotion
[08:25:12] <iShareFreedom> of malware
[08:25:15] <iShareFreedom> how i can block him
[08:25:17] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: "Promotion"
[08:25:18] <iShareFreedom> what is the command 
[08:25:20] <labrador> iShareFreedom, its not malware man
[08:25:29] <DiffieHellman> labrador: It is malware, but okay.
[08:25:30] <iShareFreedom> what is the command
[08:25:33] <iShareFreedom> for block him
[08:25:37] <labrador> iShareFreedom, /ignore labrador 
[08:25:39] <Andrew> iShareFreedom: I don't know Icedove commands
[08:25:40] <DiffieHellman> iShareFreedom: You can't block on irc, but you can ignore
[08:25:48] <Andrew> labrador: He uses icedove, not weechat or anything
[08:25:52] <labrador> lmao
[08:26:22] <Andrew> Why would you use a Thunderbird fork to chat on IRC?
[08:27:32] <labrador> That was the reason I rejected thunderbird as an email client lol
[08:27:34] <tpefreedom> I use hexchat
[08:27:39] <labrador> It just had so much more than just email
[08:27:52] <Andrew> Mutt :)
[08:27:52] <labrador> Like it had a newsgroup reader too wtf
[08:28:06] <tpefreedom> I'm currently looking for a kcma-d8 that supports libreboot

[08:45:17] <DiffieHellman> Whistler: I believe 3 specific models sold by realtek that are in a few usb wireless cards.
[08:45:33] <Whistler> the best I can think of are intel ones but all require blobs.  Broadcom and realtek ones are even worse
[08:45:39] <DiffieHellman> The firmware is in binary form, although under the GPLv2 and the driver is hot garbage
[08:46:03] <labrador> DiffieHellman, wait why is it under the gplv2?
[08:46:12] <labrador> Does realtek release their firmware?
[08:47:37] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Since the driver was for Linux and relies on whatever that generic wireless driver is named
[08:47:50] <DiffieHellman> I don't think anyone has actually asked yet.'
[08:48:07] <labrador> ohh so its forced to be gpl'ed
[08:48:08] <labrador> nice
[08:48:28] <DiffieHellman> Yes, realtek decided not to violate the GPLv2 for that specific family of drivers.

[12:12:08] <DiffieHellman> comrad: FSFE seems to deviate from the FSF's ideals and so the FSF doesn't support them.
[12:12:41] <Whistler> https://www.fsf.org/about/fsf-other
[12:14:06] <Whistler> iirc there was also fsf france which seems inactive for ages.  Not sure what the status is
[12:16:32] <kilobug> Whistler: FSF France doesn't really exist, it's more of an empty shell; we have April which is the most active Free Software-related organization here, and some activity of FSFE, and many other more specific ones

[23:33:55] <kataphusin> I am thinking about collecting a small suite of lightweight free software tools that could be mixed and matched, so not like Blue Button. 
[23:34:52] <kataphusin> Some basic questions I have are: is there a free software alternative to Reveal.js/Beamer and PlantUML (which I use in Emacs) and is there a way for teachers to set up their own IRC channels?
[23:35:52] <kataphusin> I am also interested in collaboration software - and looking into ways to maybe use git to help solve some use-cases.

[23:40:26] <kataphusin> On a totally different note, H-Node is great and helps guide the threat level of changing to free software OS, but there is very little documentation about - sorry to mention it - how to manage non-free blobs that would make up for hardware restrictions.
[23:41:35] <djatropine> what kind of collaboration software? Puredata & GEM? :D
[23:42:27] <kataphusin> djatropine I need to look that up, I hadn't heard of either :)
[23:45:17] <kataphusin> I can't find gem, but I was thinking about - at the very least - a way for people to add comments (marginalia) to texts but if also possible, to create mental maps together (PlantUML is a great example of something easy enough to use: but it is not free software).
[23:45:49] <djatropine> i often use this mind mapping program
