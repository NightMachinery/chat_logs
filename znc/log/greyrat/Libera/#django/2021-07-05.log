[02:28:37] <avdempsey> I had some curious behavior where modifying a field in a model instance in a queryset (accessed via numeric index) didn't save unless I was stepping through in the debugger: https://dpaste.org/ut29
[02:29:08] <avdempsey> Changing the code try/except on a model get method (instead of filter) works fine.
[02:30:59] <avdempsey> I haven't tracked down a place in the documentation where it advises against modifying an instance in this way. Also curious about how stepping through in the debugger could change this. When I would step through in the debugger, I'd check to see the field value had been changed (using django admin) before continuing execution.

[07:29:26] <humanBird> is it impossible to deploy to AWS elastic beanstalk?
[07:29:50] <humanBird> It just seems like this is completely garbage and all the information I read is just wrong. especially the aws documentation.

[07:35:30] <humanBird> eb deploy just has too many errors.
[07:35:50] <humanBird> all i did basically was djang admin a new project, git commit it and try to eb deploy. why is this so impossible?
[07:41:51] <humanBird> i'm looking at this config: WSGIPath: ebdjango.wsgi:application        but i see that there's a ebdjango/ebdjango folder with a wsgi.py file in it.  should i move the file out?
[07:46:11] <humanBird> it seems that whoever wrote this configuration doesn't even know how the django file structure gets populated...

[07:46:55] <hemebond> humanBird: The first ebdjango is the project directory
[07:47:01] <hemebond> The second is the module directory
[07:47:23] <hemebond> So the wsgi path should be correct if the project directory is the root.
[07:47:44] <humanBird> the wsgi file is in the deeper folder
[07:47:50] <humanBird> it's not in the project root.
[07:47:55] <hemebond> Correct.
[07:47:58] <hemebond> That's should be fine.
[07:48:08] <humanBird> why am i getting an error that say sit can't find it ?
[07:48:10] <hemebond> Assuming the project directory is the root of whatever you're uploading.
[07:48:23] <hemebond> Probably because the project directory is not the root.
[07:49:26] <humanBird> i'm going to cd into the first level of the same named folder and try to deploy
[07:50:07] <humanBird> no improvment. still 502
[07:52:25] <humanBird> same error. this is ridiculous

[09:48:42] <serafeim> hello friends
[09:49:21] <FunkyBob> Guest68: wsgi or asgi server... like gunicorn, or uwsgi, or uvicorn,
[09:49:45] <Guest68> ooh wsgi in the procfile with gunicorn
[09:49:46] <FunkyBob> the program that actually runs django for you
[09:49:57] <FunkyBob> ok
[09:52:45] <Guest68> another thing is that the session id does not last i login to admin and as soon as i click on something i get logged out
[09:54:12] <FunkyBob> hmm
[09:54:21] <FunkyBob> it it http or https?
[09:54:45] <Guest68> https without specifying my own domain. it is using theirs
[09:55:51] <FunkyBob> you can check your browser debug panel's Network tab to see which cookies it has for the site and why it does/doesn't send them
[09:56:43] <Guest68> hmm i may have found something
[09:58:00] <Guest68> https://dpaste.org/u8eo
[09:58:29] <Guest68> the heroku logs --tail looks good
[09:59:00] <Guest68> networking tab doesn't show much
[09:59:21] <Guest68> console though shows Cookie “sessionid” has been rejected because it is already expired.

[10:00:56] <Guest68> it is so random
[10:11:47] <FunkyBob> what time is it setting for the cookie, and what time does the server think it is?
[10:12:05] <FunkyBob> whilst I understand  the benefits of a free host, i've not used one...
[10:12:32] <Guest68> it says expiration session
[10:12:44] <Guest68> i am just testing it out to see if i want to buy it
[10:12:59] <Guest68> im glad i got as far as i did but this worries me
[10:13:51] <FunkyBob> aiui it's only free tier that auto spins down to 0 workers
[10:14:44] <Guest68> so you think this is fine?
[10:14:56] <FunkyBob> i've not used heroku in a long time
[10:15:03] <FunkyBob> afaik it's fine
[10:15:09] <Guest68> i hope so
[10:15:23] <FunkyBob> for paid stuff, I'm a long time Digital Ocean user, and recently had pleasant experiences with Vultr
[10:15:30] <FunkyBob> I have a referral code for DO
[10:15:30] <Guest68> i wonder why though my one js file is not loading (a cookies one)
[10:16:16] <Guest68> yea i was on the path of IaaS but it is just too much for 1 person to do just to start things up
[10:16:45] <Guest68> and maintain it
[10:16:59] <Guest68> maybe in the future i'll move to IaaS
[10:18:24] <Guest68> but then i figured if i die my family could still run the site
[10:21:01] <twomoon> what do you use Vultr for?
[10:22:00] <FunkyBob> I used it for testing some VPS django install configs

[18:21:58] <FunkyBob> yes
[18:22:10] <FunkyBob> what do you mean "correct json format"?
[18:22:19] <FunkyBob> JSON is a string format... it's a data serialisation format
[18:22:52] <pycode> FunkyBob, so a string in that format can be manipulated via JS without any other conversion right ?
[18:23:12] <FunkyBob> no, nothing can "manipulate" JSON.. it needs to be deserialised
[18:23:17] <FunkyBob> that's the whole point of a serialisation format
[18:23:23] <FunkyBob> JSON.parse() it
[18:23:30] <pycode> yes pardon, i mean js can deserialize it
[18:23:32] <pycode> yes ok
[18:23:34] <pycode> perfect
[18:24:51] <pycode> FunkyBob, i am dealing with a problem...as i wrote i am writing such view to return the points for the chart...now i have to understand when i need new data
[18:25:00] <pycode> to avoid the user wait it
[18:25:20] <pycode> i mean, during the scrolling i should keep continung calling that endpoint
[18:25:36] <FunkyBob> scrolling of what?
[18:26:03] <pycode> the chart, my problem is that some chart has around 200.000 points to show
[18:26:13] <Kim^J> Why?
[18:26:20] <FunkyBob> ok, but scrolling how?
[18:26:28] <pycode> i can cache them without asking again and again from the db
[18:26:36] <pycode> horizontal scroll to see the history
[18:26:40] <pycode> it is a candlestick chart

[18:27:44] <Kim^J> Condense minutes to hours, hours to days, etc.
[18:28:03] <pycode> cant because i must show when an event happen, so i must show the exact candle
[18:28:24] <pycode> i must to use the correct timeframe, so if it is ONE MINUTE i must show one minute and so on..
[18:29:51] <pycode> so my problem is that i have many candle to show, so the question is: should i load everything with one request? or... when the user move the horizontal cursor i must keep asking new prices
[18:30:01] <pycode> i repeat i can cache it
[18:30:05] <pycode> to avoid new db requests

[18:30:34] <pycode> so i update everything
[18:30:56] <pycode> so after this update i can cache everything, create charts one time and show them as normal html without recreate them...i do not know
[18:31:02] <pycode> i do not know what way to follow
[18:31:50] <pycode> fr example i can create the chart server side and then provide it as normal svg
[18:32:00] <pycode> and maybe set nginx to compress with gzip
[18:32:04] <pycode> dik
[18:32:06] <pycode> idk
[18:32:36] <pycode> i am building a kind of reports...and those reports have charts
[18:32:53] <pycode> but it is not a "real-time" data...i update it one time a day
[18:33:30] <pycode> i build a command that update the database but now for the frontend i need to find a way to show this data, for textual is simple, table/grid etc.. for charts i do not know.
[18:35:09] <Kim^J> Well, 200k points is gonna be a bitch to render.
[18:35:30] <pycode> Kim^J, yes exactly, that's the problem
[18:35:44] <Kim^J> So, don't render 200k points.
[18:35:59] <pycode> is it better to pre-render the charts into a svg and then just return a giant svg?
[18:36:10] <pycode> Kim^J, so? keep asking new data when the user moves the curson ?
[18:36:51] <pycode> the updates should be on background...i mean i do not want to block the user during the scrolling, so i should load more data
[18:37:26] <pycode> i mean, if i get from point 0 to point 1000
[18:37:45] <pycode> i should ask for 1001 to 2000 when the user is seeing the point 500 less or more
[18:37:47] <pycode> understand?
[18:38:01] <pycode> no when the user reachs the end
[18:41:01] <pycode> should i hold all the data in memory or not? i mean... if i load 0-1000 then 1001 to 2000 should i leave it there or just render 1000 points ?
[18:41:25] <pycode> because the problem could be that if the user is coming back on the history i need to load that data again and again
