[15:08:10] <gordonjcp> afternoon
[15:09:00] <gordonjcp> I want to run some docker containers that contain qemu virtual machines, because that seems to be the "cleanest" way to specify the disk images that they boot off, and how the hardware is connected up
[15:09:36] *** Joins: pipapipapipo (~peppbel@076-083-166-225.res.spectrum.com)
[15:09:45] <gordonjcp> the only issue is that the very specific old OS on the VMs wants to set its own IP addresses based on the config of the machines, which is fine, that's what I'm doing it for
[15:10:49] <gordonjcp> I think what I can do is create a docker network in the right subnet, tell qemu to use a host interface, and it ought to work out okay, right?

[17:38:18] <minimal> faceface: if you just do "-p 45678:80" then that means your docker app is available on port 45678 of *all* IP addresses of the host machine. Whether that is available exernally depends on things such as whether you have a firewall on the docker host (and if so if it allows/blocks such a port0
[17:39:03] <minimal> which WAN? Is your docker host a router?
[17:39:09] <faceface> hi minimal 
[17:39:37] <faceface> I'm using a virtual machine on a hetzner cloud
[17:40:00] <faceface> iptables -L shows a bunch of stuff that I don't really understand, I just figured it would be blocked by default
[17:40:08] <faceface> (from 'outside' localhost)
[17:40:18] <faceface> I'm calling that 'WAN', I'm not good at netowrking
[17:40:20] <minimal> well that's a firewall or OS issue, not a docker issue
[17:40:29] <faceface> cool
[17:40:47] <minimal> same as if you ran a server directly on the VM that listened on an externally accessible porrt
[17:40:50] <faceface> I was wondering if docker tried to do UPNP, for example
[17:41:21] <faceface> right, I was (naively?) expecting the machine to be secure by default
[17:41:23] <minimal> nope, docker does not do UPNP, though it is possible to run a upnp server in docker
[17:41:28] <faceface> cool
[17:42:02] <minimal> yes I'd expect a reasonable firewall/iptables config to be deny inbound by default
[17:42:31] <faceface> I notice cointainerd isn't visible from outside (at least)

[17:42:59] <faceface> yeah, that's what I'm staring at now...

[19:39:32] <programmerq> you can use a bind mount to get a directory from your host mounted in the container, and if you have a nodejs code reloader you can turn that on.

[20:04:03] <faceface> I figured I'm not the first person to ask this...
[20:04:25] <faceface> I have configured the cert on the nginx reverse-proxy ... perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong
[20:05:23] <programmerq> you can inject a cert via a bind mount. you can inject a config for a tls listener via a bind mount.
[20:05:36] <programmerq> and then publish whatever port you designate
[20:05:39] <faceface> programmerq: right
[20:05:57] <faceface> but I want the container to be oblivious to the domain it's running on
[20:06:06] <faceface> the reverse proxy takes care of that
[20:06:14] <faceface> I think I'm terminally confused ;-)
[20:06:55] <programmerq> You can just shove in any old cert and nginx will just use it. if you just want a reverse proxy to connect to this, than you can probably just use a self-signed cert if that's easier.
[20:07:47] <faceface> I guess I need to change certbot's default config of the reverse proxy and change 443 to the port in the proxy_pass
[20:07:50] <programmerq> if you have exactly one server block with TLS enabled, it'll be used no matter what name is configured.
[20:08:25] <faceface> You can just shove in any old cert and nginx will just use it. <- does that mean it will open port 443?
[20:08:32] <faceface> Currently it just opens port 80
[20:08:38] <programmerq> cert and config file
[20:08:48] <faceface> k
[20:08:56] <programmerq> you'll need both. the config file will use whatever cert you tell it to and listen on whatever port you tell it to.
