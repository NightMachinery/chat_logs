[00:16:49] <iivvoo> when using the flag package, I want not specifying -foo to be different from -foo (default to value 0, for example) and -foo=10 (foo will have value 10). Not really sure how to do this though - it either uses the specified default or nothing

[00:25:32] <iivvoo> hmm okay, I'll use two flags then. I'm actually using this to parse commands on a sort-of-a-shell and having a more concise syntax is preferable. Perhaps I'll replace it at a later stage
[00:25:56] <iivvoo> so in stead of `query -reduce | reduce=2` I now have `query -reduce -level=2`

[00:28:49] *** Quits: independent56 (~independe@2.25.26.77) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[00:34:02] <fizzie> The impossible part is determining whether, in `cmd -flag foo`, the foo is a positional parameter or an argument for `-flag`, if the argument is optional. Of course you can solve it by being inconsistent in some other way, like requiring the = for optional arguments and only allowing `-flag arg` where it's non-optional.
[00:35:45] <KirkMcDonald> The argparse solution is to be greedy about it. If -flag has an optional argument, then it grabs the next argument if it is present and does not look like another flag.

[20:43:29] <seebs> i'm not sure what you're referring to.
[20:43:30] <Tv_> because they realized that swagger was an overly hipster name, and overcorrected to as nondescriptive and bland as possible
