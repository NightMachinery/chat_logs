[00:03:06] <mycroftiv> gate logic and infinite binary bitstrings and ultrafilters on N and N->bool and n->bool->bool and how classical and intuitionistic logic differ - i think its at the heart of an ongoing breakthrough
[00:03:30] <greenbagels> Z-module: huh, that is a neat result
[00:03:58] <Z-module> It's more often stated as: Every nonempty compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.

[00:04:46] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: What I find really neat is that crit-bit trees (a data structure designed for practical purposes) correspond to clopen subsets of Cantor space.
[00:04:48] <mycroftiv> i love that theorem, its one of my favorites
[00:05:33] <isekaijin> It's rare to see a practical data structure correspond to anything mathematically nice.
[00:05:37] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: i should look that up, it reminds me of the BIT function and how you can go from multiple bits set within N bits to a single bit set on or off in 2^N length sgtring
[00:05:53] <Z-module> So in particular, no compact metric spaces can be bigger in cardinality than R.  This really startled me when I first learned it. THere are arbitrarily large compact hausdorff spaces, for example, and also arbitrarily large non-compact metric spaces.
[00:05:57] <mycroftiv> deep connections here with the 'random' Rado graph which is the limit of random, coinflips
[00:06:43] <mycroftiv> z-module: do you know if that is true even under the strongest large cardinal assumptions? measurable and supercompact and rank-into-rank cardinals sometimes are asterisks to statements about compactness

[18:55:51] <cheater> way ahead of you ;-)
[18:56:05] <cheater> just kidding
[18:56:06] <Z-module> TOB_CyxoB: yes, but very conveniently, every real r >= 0 has a unique square root that is also a real >= 0, and using this particular value *does* give a continuous function on all of [0, +infty) that's even infinitely differentiable on (0, +infty), and by long-standing convention we mean this particular value when writing   sqrt(...)   for any nonnegative real argument.
[18:56:42] <isekaijin> TOB_CyxoB: The continuity of the complex square root function doesn't just break at a single point. It breaks at a whole curve emanating from the origin, “extending all the way to infinity”.
[18:56:48] <greenbagels> can't you rewrite this as cos(u)sin(a) + v*cos(u)sin(b) for some choice of u, v, maybe
[18:56:50] <isekaijin> (A curve on the complex plane.)
[18:56:59] <greenbagels> dont know if this helps, but maybe its an idea, since x, y are in [0,1]
[18:57:32] <cheater> yeah, essentially i could just write k sin at + sin bt, and that gets me the whole way too
[18:58:37] <isekaijin> The only thing that comes to my mind is taking u = (at + bt) / 2 and v = (at - bt) / 2, and then expanding sin(at) = sin(u + v) and sin(bt) = sin(u - v).
[18:58:50] <isekaijin> But I doubt this makes things any simpler.

[21:09:49] <Franciman> hi TheHermann
[21:10:00] <Franciman> can you share more information about your protocol and your task?
[21:10:30] <cheater> what's the proof for convergence of \sum (-1)^k / sqrt n? i forgot it
[21:10:40] <TheHermann> hi
[21:10:51] <Z-module> cheater: the alternating series test
[21:11:05] <Z-module> which works because the function 1/sqrt(n)  is monotonically decreasing
[21:11:11] <Z-module> (to a limit of 0)
[21:11:31] <ysiry> int-e, the point is that in a 2-dimensional map, no matter how irregular shape you draw, you wont need more than 4 colors to ensure lack of connections. Same thing goes for 3d, no matter how you play with it, in theory there has to be a limit on the number of connections (or clashes between similar colors)
[21:11:53] <Z-module> also, cheater, you didn't mean k and n both, there... same variable, the summation variable
