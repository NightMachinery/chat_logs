[04:03:44] <Node99> I know the topic here is network security but I have a question for anyone who is knowledgable about networking.
[04:04:12] <Node99> I have a network consisting of 2 routers and multiple devices. The 2nd router is connected to one of the ethernet ports of the 1st router. Behind the 2nd router I have setup NFS shares on my Raspberry Pi4. I have modded my fstab and exports and everything works fine behind the 2nd router but I can't access the shares from any device connected through the first router. Any ideas?

[04:23:26] <sartan> do the routers have routes configured facing each other for their corresponding connected routes? Either static routes or any routing protocol? They need to be aware of each others routes
[04:23:37] *** Quits: ice9 (~ice9@user/ice9) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:24:04] <Node99> I tried setting static routes with no luck
[04:24:06] <sartan> and 'router' unfortunately can be a loaded term these days, if they're firewalls they may also have some access lists on them that prevent inter-zone traffic, depending on how they're configured
[04:24:06] <ajak> from the end user's perspective your router should only need to know the next hop up from it, same as the device behind your router
[04:24:14] <sartan> start with 'traceroute' and see how far youg et
[04:24:23] <Node99> it timed out
[04:24:27] <sartan> You'll need static routes bidirectionally as well so the server can reach the client and vice-versa.
[04:24:41] <Node99> The first router's subnet is 192.168.0.1 and the second router's subnet is 192.168.1.1. I have considered setting static routes but I'm not sure this is the answer either.
[04:24:52] <sartan> default route on the server, default route on the client, static routes on each router for those respective subnets, pointing at th e ethernet ip address as next-hop on each router link.
[04:24:57] <sartan> Yes, static routes is the answer.
[04:25:29] <Node99> ok
[04:26:12] <sartan> server -- [eth0:192.168.1.1/24]->router2->[10.0.0.1/31:eth1]->[10.0.0.2/31:eth1]->router2->[192.168.0.1/24:eth0] -> client
[04:26:13] <Node99> ok so my pi is 192.168.1.106...
[04:26:30] <sartan> router1 configured with static route 192.168.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.2. router2 configured with static route 192.168.1.0/24 via 10.0.0.1
[04:26:54] <sartan> server configured with default static route 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.1.1, client configured wtih static route 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.0.1 [or dhcp-provided default routes]
[04:27:49] <Node99> ok on router 2....destination ip address would be the gateway address for router 2...

[04:28:18] *** Joins: BUSY (~BUSY@user/busy)

[04:33:46] <Node99> I'm racking my brain here with this one...but this should be possible for these devices to share files
[04:34:17] <Node99> ok this is my fstab:
[04:34:32] <sartan> can they ping each other?
[04:34:37] <Node99> 192.168.1.106:/mnt/NFS /mnt/NFS       nfs    defaults      0       0
[04:34:42] <sartan> we should test this before debugging nfs.
[04:34:47] <Node99> nope they can't ping each other
[04:34:53] <sartan> okay, so you can ignore your fstab.
[04:35:05] <sartan> they can't route to each other.
[04:36:17] <Node99> ok I got the part where on the 2nd router it's 192.168.1.1 and tried to add a static route...from the 1st router...which has it assigned as 192.168.0.104
[04:36:59] <Node99> so 192.168.1.1 = 192.168.0.104
[04:37:23] <Node99> I figuire that needs to be added somehow to my static route
[04:38:25] <sartan> no, that's not quite right...
[04:38:45] <sartan> between router1 and router2, you should have an IP subnet that is unique to that point-to-point link
[04:39:00] <sartan> what kind of routers are these?
[04:39:02] <sartan> this will help

[04:40:54] <sartan> on this old device unless you can create vlans, vlan interfaces, and pin specific ports to specific vlans you won't be able to do this. small business/home tier stuff is really restricted in how you can configure their layer3 stuff
[04:41:23] <sartan> they only have two l3 interfaces: "WAN" and "LAN".. you may not be able to add a third
[04:41:32] <Node99> ok so if you follow me...router 1 eth port [1] [2] [3] [4] ....port 1 goes out via land line to router 2's internet port
[04:41:45] <sartan> they're daisy-chained?
[04:42:11] <sartan> this use case may depend on icmp redirects being sent, and respected by the server then
[04:42:35] <sartan> plus possible NAT on that wndr
[04:43:03] <Node99> network address translation?
[04:43:31] <sartan> ya.. so if the wndr here is attached to a lan port on the tp-link, i'm assuming the wndr has an ip in the same subnet as the lan client, right?
[04:43:37] <sartan> on its wan interface
[04:44:00] <Node99> would connecting both routers into a switch help?
[04:44:20] <Node99> wndr?
[04:44:22] <sartan> we're limited here by the features these devices let us configure in their user interfaces

[04:45:53] <Node99> I had thought well connect both routers into a switch and use vlan

[04:53:32] <sartan> I can't draw for crap =)
[04:54:03] <sartan> This design might work for you without having to recable everything, and accomodates for some limitations in the tp-link and linksys firmware which prevents you from creating new routed interfaces & firewall zones. those small home office things are really feature-poor
[04:54:15] <Node99> so it goes [cable modem]------[router 3]----switch-[ [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] ]---switch----[]port 2 ----router 1 -----[]port3---router 2
[04:54:31] <sartan> so on the linksys, clients behind the linksys are members of 192.168.0.0/24 (i'm assuming).  You have the WAN port connected to a LAN port on the tplink
[04:54:54] <sartan> when traffic traverses from th e linksys lan port to its wan port, it will do network address translation for all the lan traffic going to the wan
[04:55:01] <Node99> no the linksys is 192.168.1.0/24
[04:55:14] <sartan> okay, i might have the subnets in the wrong spot (swap them) but the problem statement is the same
[04:55:38] <sartan> the client should be able to ping the server across NAT. the server will not be able to ping the client because it can't route, and we can't disable nat on the linksys.
[04:55:57] <Node99> yes the wan port of the linksys is connected to a lan port of the tp link
[04:57:13] <sartan> if the client canping the server, we should be able to make NFS work, but it requires setting the 'insecure' option on the NFS export of the server. the ip range for the server should be 192.168.1.0/24 (not 192.168.0.0/24).  The 'insecure' option is required because NFS by default will origintate client traffic from port < 1024 to something higher starting from 32768 or something, and NFS server doesn't
[04:57:14] <sartan> quite like that. the 'insecure' bit lets nfs client mounts happen in these higher port ranges
[04:57:42] <sartan> in any case if you can ping the server from the client, through nat, we should be able to get nfs working.  if the nfs server is behind the linksys there's noething we can do
[04:57:49] <sartan> well unless we add more NAT rules =)
[04:57:50] <Node99> ok as for the nfs...
[04:58:08] <Node99> i have it set for both subnets
[04:58:53] <Node99> gimme a sec lemme log into webmin for the pi
[04:59:25] <sartan> i really hate small/home office stuff, it's incredibly feature-limited. my full time job is network engineering & automation so i hate these little trashy boxes, so inflexible to do anything but the most utter basic of things.
[04:59:46] <sartan> i'll buy them but reflash with custom firmware if they have a good broadcom asic that permits vlan configuration
[04:59:51] <Node99> hmm
[05:00:14] <sartan> why do you have two routers anyhow and not just a switch?
[05:00:27] <Node99> mnt/PNY64GB	192.168.0.1/24(insecure,rw,nohide,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,sync,no_subtree_check)
[05:00:39] <Node99> mnt/PNY64GB	192.168.1.0/24(insecure,rw,nohide,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,sync,no_subtree_check)
[05:00:46] <sartan> 192.168.0.0/24
[05:00:50] <Node99> the front dash is removed because this is irc
[05:01:07] <Node99> thats from my exports
[05:01:20] <sartan> yeah the subnet mask is wrong. 192.168.0.1 is a host in that /24, not the subnet id
[05:01:36] <sartan> you could represent both subnets with 192.168.0.0/23
[05:01:40] <sartan> and a single export
[05:01:53] <sartan> but in any case the nfs serverw on't ever see the linksys subnet in the first place given the NAT.
[05:02:11] <Node99> that seems to be a problem
[05:02:25] <Node99> even using a static route
[05:02:58] <sartan> so why do you have two routers? can you just use the linksys as a switch (disable dhcp on its lan port) and connect one of its lan ports to the lan port of the tplink
[05:03:10] <sartan> then your clients & server are in the same subnet
[05:03:22] <sartan> i'm guessing you just want more ports and don't actually own a switch
[05:03:39] <Node99> I have a problem with people just resetting the 1st router...but the 2nd router is behind a locked door so they can't
[05:03:53] <Node99> yeah i have a netgear managed switch
[05:04:03] <Node99> it's not in use right now though
[05:05:10] <Node99> ok not sure you understood that the export table I posted is from behind the 2nd router

[05:12:39] <sartan> can you use NFSv4? It's more friendly to work behind nat
[05:13:33] <Node99> yup
[05:13:42] <sartan> you'll want to run rpcinfo -p | grep nfs and forward all those ports that appear in the command from the nfs server on your linksys fw
[05:13:59] <sartan> bascially rpc port mapper and tpc/udp 2049
[05:14:22] <sartan> nfsv4 lets us pin the mount port for rpc too with --port <x>

[05:36:07] <Node99> I admit this was put together pretty fast...I didn't have a lot of time...but none the less...
[05:36:33] <sartan> you're also depending on /etc/hosts to have a non-127.0.0.1 resolution for its local hostname which is almost never the case, a traceroute from 127.0.0.1 is not routable

[08:13:57] <MadCamel> don't think so.. medical scanners came out about the same time as network scanners. I think it just came naturally. Searching and scanning can be used almost interchangably. But if you use the wrong one it sounds funny because english is weird.
[08:15:01] <ajak> yeah, "scanning" is a generic term that sort of means looking over something

[09:35:15] <electr0n> ajak: why are you even aware let alone have the number stored in mem for quick ref :)
[09:35:37] <ajak> i actually had to google "ipv6 base85" to find it again :D
[09:35:59] <ajak> but i've been reading up on ipv6 and the tldp ipv6 docs referenced it
[09:36:22] <sartan> i've found so many bugs with ipv6 behavior on switch operating system platforms =/
[09:36:34] <shlomif> electr0n: there are 85 bases? https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/540:_Base_System ;)
[09:36:40] <sartan> the most annoying one is not respecting unsolicited ipv6 neighbor advertisements, it's a huge pain in my ass for evpn-vxlan networks with anycast gateway routing
[09:36:43] <sartan> Rawr!
[09:36:54] <ajak> note the date that rfc1924 is dated though :)
[09:37:03] <sartan> when the RFCs put MUST for behavior, it breaks application flow. have to convince NOS vendors to violate rfc. =)
[09:37:53] <sartan> I could write a 30 page whitepaper on bugs i found in just the last 6 months
[09:38:06] <sartan> i don't even have ipv6 at home though what a farce
[09:38:24] <ajak> i'm still scared of it and drop it incoming and outgoing :(
[09:38:32] <ajak> hence why i've been reading up on it
[09:38:48] <sartan> there's a big push for it in large-scale datacenter space
[09:38:56] <sartan> not enough IPs to go around, even RFC1918 isn't enough
[09:39:20] <sartan> so there's a lot of behavior like rfc5549 to route ipv4 traffic across ipv6 links
[09:39:49] <sartan> there's quite a bit of protocol interaction, kernel behavior, asic programming behavior, rib/fib weirdness going on when you start messing with the cosmos like that
[09:40:33] <sartan> linux (zebra+frr) will create APIPA routes through netlink api when it learns a v4 route across a v6 route, but there's a lot of hard coded assumption that every link is point to point, 'if its not me it must be you', which falls apart with point to multipoint stuff

[23:44:47] <Hash> Just read it
[23:44:52] <Hash> Thanks for the knowledge
[23:45:10] <Hash> Is this something similiar I think to no execute bit etc. but not hardware based
[23:45:33] <Hash> I wonder if there can be a hardware based protection against general malware/rootkits etc. etc.
[23:45:46] <death916> isnt that what tpm is
[23:45:50] <Hash> not really
[23:45:51] <death916> supposed to be
[23:46:05] <Hash> Well kind of it is but there are lackings
[23:46:10] <Hash> if my englishmakes sense
[23:46:34] <Hash> Because you know, tpm enabled machines also get infected
[23:46:53] <death916> also i read an article yesterday said it was defeated in 30 minutes

[23:49:33] <Hash> However, Xbox 360 (before the RGH/JTAG/RJTAG) exploits was unbreakable
[23:49:36] <death916> ya that article was really in teresting
[23:49:42] <Hash> and XboxOne so far has no exploits for hypervisor level
[23:49:56] <death916> i think i saw someone got to root filesystem
[23:49:57] <Hash> Nintendo is trivial most of the time
[23:49:59] <death916> on xbox
[23:50:03] <Hash> xbox one?
[23:50:05] <death916> but i think it was read only
[23:50:08] <Hash> hmm. I hadn't heard of that
[23:50:30] <Hash> oh, that's easy. You know the file system and you know it isn't encrypted
[23:50:45] <Hash> afaik, system software sits unencypted
[23:51:08] <Hash> It is easy to dump it from the NAND onboad that holds the system software
[23:51:14] <Hash> But so far, airtight.

[23:52:03] <Hash> What gets me is this
[23:52:19] <Hash> On the n otorous 360 RGH (reset glitch hack) exploit
[23:52:31] <Hash> They used a Xilinx CPLD to slow down the cpu clock, bypassing the pll etc.
[23:52:56] <Hash> Then when cpu is at very low freq, i forgot which, very low, they send a 90ns pulse to the CPU_RESET
[23:53:16] <Hash> which doesn't reset the cpu, but makes it so that somehow mem_cmp (compare) function returns null instead of boolean true/false
[23:53:18] <death916> idk how ppl figure that stuff out
[23:53:23] <Hash> That's what I'mwondering
[23:53:25] <Hash> How do you do that
[23:53:28] <Hash> YHou just try diff things?

[23:53:44] <Hash> I'm very curious about the process
[23:54:02] <Hash> One, you have to fully understand the entire boot process, in detail.
[23:54:22] <Hash> Then you have to understand hardware and side channel attacks and hardware attacks on crypto systems
[23:54:28] <Hash> I mean, tht's genius level stuff.
[23:54:43] <death916> need docs of the hardware probablyy specs
[23:54:54] <death916> otherwise idk

[23:55:32] *** Quits: TheSilentLink (~TheSilent@user/thesilentlink) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:55:40] <Hash> The reset glitch hack works by using Phase-Locked Loops (PLL) to slow the CPU down by 128 times and sending a small electric pulse into the CPU_RST (CPU reset) point. This causes CPU registers to return false data and allow the execution of unsigned code. The electric pulse sent to the CPU needs to be very precise and well timed, and since every console is different, extra capacitors and/or
[23:55:43] <Hash> resistors need to be added on some consoles in order to achieve a successful glitch.
