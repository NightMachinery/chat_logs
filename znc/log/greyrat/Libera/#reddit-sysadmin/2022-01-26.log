[01:11:50] <PanickedKernel> Hey all. I'm wondering if there is a good(pref oss) alternative to comodo's free firewall. One thing I really liked about it was it had some kinda IDS where it would ask to allow something to run before executing it. It was simple and didn't require any configuration other then clicking allow or deny.

[01:18:49] <Cl0udNinja> I used it because I was familiar with it for AWS, and then I had to do the same process for GCP and Azure, and neither GCP or Azure support a chroot-like install process

[02:21:35] <sideup66> 35 freedom dollars
[02:21:36] <Hobadee> We had a company that provided us toner.  It was off-brand, but *good* off-brand.  Didn't have any issues with it.
[02:21:42] <Hobadee> I can hook you up with them if you need.
[02:21:46] <sideup66> so theres good and shit off brand
[02:21:47] <Kiernian> any old is fine. those things are not picky about off-brand toner. The only danger is a mess if you get REALLY cheap toner and the cartridge is a damaged refill that leaks..in which case canned air fixes the problem
[02:22:10] <sideup66> making these things sound indestructable
[02:22:27] <Hobadee> sideup66: They are.
[02:22:29] <Kiernian> they pretty much are. Everything that can break on them is easily replaceable. They don't make them like that anymore

[04:10:00] <PattyCakes> not for any particular reason, just in genearl
[04:10:03] <PattyCakes> genearl*
[04:10:05] <PattyCakes> fuck it
[04:10:11] <PattyCakes> too much whiskey apparently.
[04:10:18] <Hobadee> Or two little?
[04:10:25] <Hobadee> s/two/too
[04:10:25] <layer8> Hobadee meant: "Or too little?"
[04:10:26] <PattyCakes> now, the two weren't little
[04:10:27] <PattyCakes> :P
[04:10:34] <AdmiralNines> I know of at least one MAJOR and very IMPORTANT TECHNICAL company in my region that transfers passwords over plaintext on their network, as confirmed by a friend of mine whose a major sysadmin there and really frustrated with them.
[04:10:39] <Kiernian> HAAAAAHAHAHAHA I still remember the day that a tiny CLEC/ILEC (I forget which) I did work for on occasion had it found out that they stored ALL customer payment transaction data in cleartext...during a PCI compliance audit
[04:11:23] <PattyCakes> a company which shall be unnamed, did something similar only so much worse
[04:11:27] <xe0n> MAJOR SYSADMIN
[04:11:27] <xe0n> LOL!
[04:11:28] <Hobadee> I don't hate my former company, otherwise I would definitely recommend an auditor check them out.
[04:11:35] <PattyCakes> recurring payments were done manually
[04:11:38] <PattyCakes> and all the credit card numbers were in a google sheet
[04:11:40] <AdmiralNines> :)
[04:11:47] <Hobadee> xe0n: As opposed to minor sysadmins
[04:11:48] <AdmiralNines> Sometimes I make up my own phrases.
[04:11:48] <Kiernian> Yes, basically that PattyCakes
[04:11:50] <PattyCakes> the billing team would go through weekly and process the payments due
[04:11:57] <PattyCakes> using a google sheet full of cards
[04:12:02] <AdmiralNines> Or a colonel sysadmin
[04:12:05] <PattyCakes> and ofc mistakes happned, ALL the time
[04:12:28] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> I should print this conversation out and read it when I'm trying to go to sleep at night
[04:12:36] <PattyCakes> and I'm not saying they had them in a spread sheet, no
[04:12:41] <PattyCakes> they had them in GOOGLE SHEETS
[04:12:56] <PattyCakes> like, I'm out of fingers to count how many violations of all sorts of shit that is
[04:13:02] <AdmiralNines> That's awesome.
[04:13:50] <PattyCakes> I didn't last long there. Maybe made it 3 months, if even that lol
[04:14:01] <PattyCakes> enough time to find another stupid bastard to fill my shoes
[04:14:09] <PattyCakes> I think he lasted a few weeks
[04:14:14] <AdmiralNines> Anyone else scrambling to update their linux boxes due to the new PwnKit exploit?

[04:36:51] <PattyCakes> at least they didn't release the details at 4pm on a Friday
[04:37:07] <PattyCakes> any security researcher that does that should be hog tied, beaten to a bloody pulp, and then shot

[04:39:41] <technonerd> cant stand they way he speaks
[04:39:54] <PattyCakes> and somehow this one flew under my radar https://sysdig.com/blog/cve-2022-0185-container-escape/
[04:40:16] <signofzeta> the best episodes always begin with Leo introducing him as Steven Tiberius Gibson
[04:40:50] <signofzeta> i listen to my podcasts on at least 1.5x speed, so I don't really notice his pauses much
[04:40:53] <PattyCakes> can I bill AdmiralNines for making me the first one on the team to know about it - as such, the one who has to do the patchign?
[04:41:01] <PattyCakes> because I think I should be able to bill AdmiralNines for my frustrations
[04:41:01] <AdmiralNines> lol
[04:41:22] <signofzeta> yes, send your bill to admiralnines@admiralnines.com, or call 1-800-ADMIRAL-9.
[04:41:26] <AdmiralNines> See I was thinking I should bill YOU guys for letting you know your systems were vulnerable :P

[04:42:18] <signofzeta> yes, it's LPE. but like anything, it could be chained.
[04:42:24] <AdmiralNines> Look, you could pay me, or you can pay the russian/NK/chinese ransomware peeps. your choice. I'm cheaper.
[04:42:31] <PattyCakes> lulz
[04:42:41] <signofzeta> not sure if it can be exploited over SSH, but if a hacker has SSH, you've got bigger problems
[04:42:51] <PattyCakes> Hopefully I don't have to eat my words, but yes, we're patching in the morning.
[04:43:28] <signofzeta> I patched my servers while I was in here.  `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
[04:43:35] <PattyCakes> s/we're/I am
[04:43:36] <layer8> PattyCakes meant: "Hopefully I don't have to eat my words, but yes, I am patching in the morning."
[04:43:47] <signofzeta> Ubuntu has the fixes. i think all major Linuxes do
[04:43:55] <AdmiralNines> yeah that's what i read
[04:44:19] <PattyCakes> not that simple for us, requires node replacements. Nothing complicated, just not something I felt like doing at 7pm
[04:45:01] <PattyCakes> but our boxes don't even have SSH on them, soooo the attack vector is minimal
[04:45:06] <AdmiralNines> nice
[04:45:46] <PattyCakes> probably end up updating k8s inline with the node replacements. 2 birds, one asshole security researcher :P

[04:46:27] <AdmiralNines> ah yes. that's the worst
[04:47:00] <PattyCakes> I'm being sarcastic @ninjastyle incase that didn't come across
[04:47:18] <PattyCakes> now had it been released at 4pm on a Friday, that's straight asshole.
[04:47:26] <AdmiralNines> apparently this has been an available exploit since 2009
[04:47:31] <AdmiralNines> and we just now discovered it.
[04:47:35] <PattyCakes> Yup
[04:47:42] <AdmiralNines> just imagine what else is available right now that no one is using (or MAYBE no one is using)
[04:47:59] <PattyCakes> If you write code, it's shitty - that's the lesson hear
[04:48:02] <PattyCakes> all code is shitty, period
[04:48:10] <PattyCakes> here*
[04:48:13] <AdmiralNines> I'm sure all the governments are pissed that we finally found this one. I'm sure they have a list of a ton more to use that we don't know about yet.
[04:48:47] <AdmiralNines> i don't know what you're talkinga bout pattycakes. My code is impeccable /s
[04:48:53] <PattyCakes> So is mine!

[04:49:00] <PattyCakes> I mean uhh
[04:49:02] <PattyCakes> it's yea

[04:54:14] <sideup66> Kiernian: reading more on that with fusers
[04:55:26] <sideup66> im reading about that and rollers, best guide i saw was...service it only if you NEED to service it
[04:55:32] <sideup66> otherwise...dont touch it, dont look at it
[04:56:01] <Kiernian> Yeah, basically if it works -- don't screw with it. When it stops working, why is always obvious. fix that thing.
[04:56:19] <PattyCakes> That's my method for my home renovation
[04:56:29] <PattyCakes> Don't go breaking more things until you fix the currently broken things
[04:57:12] <sideup66> yeah so maybe this isnt as big of an issue as im thinking
[04:57:12] <PattyCakes> I don't always listen to myself though. Sometimes you just gotta take a sledge hammer and smash
[04:57:34] <sideup66> only dumb thing is that this stupid thing has 2 trays, i can live with 1 perfectly fine...so i might remove it to reduce bulk
[04:57:49] <sideup66> so i guess bring a reem of paper and go look, if it boots up, prints the demo ok, its fine

[05:07:18] <PattyCakes> was absolutely bonkers
[05:08:06] <PattyCakes> been accused of ruining more than 1 wedding because we couldn't print white on black paper for invites
[05:08:29] <PattyCakes> like, maybe you should have researched this months before, instead of coming to me 6 weeks before the wedding
[05:08:43] <PattyCakes> when my lead time on custom jobs that we sent out (who could do white ink) was 8-10 weeks
[05:08:45] <Kiernian> oh wow, I am SO SORRY haha
[05:09:47] <PattyCakes> the only customers that ever got any real sympathy from me were people come in for funeral related printing
[05:10:08] <PattyCakes> You can't always plan death, but you sure as shit knew 7 months ago you were pregnant or that your wedding was In July
[05:12:16] <PattyCakes> we flat out stopped doing baby shower printing in store - that shit always got sent out. Not enough hours in the day to deal with that lol

[05:15:01] <Kiernian> best use ever for a fax machine

[05:15:51] <misspwn> yeah i ordered it at like midnight hahahha
[05:16:27] <PattyCakes> Kiernian I did that too, out of boredom, only we had 7 fax machines in the print center. So not only did you get endless pages, you got them from 7 different numbers
[05:16:44] <PattyCakes> ofc I wouldn't send them all at once
[05:16:49] <Kiernian> wow that thing truly is as glorious as I had hoped.
[05:16:56] <PattyCakes> I'd wait for the line to disconnect, get blocked and moved on to the next machine

[08:08:33] <Kiernian> it shouldn't need a jetdirect card. the n is for network.

[08:12:48] <DrGibby> ah, the buzzer is back :( 
[08:13:47] <Kiernian> buzzer?
[08:16:21] <DrGibby> commonly referred to as UVB-76, or 'The Buzzer' is a numbers-station style Russian military radio station often heard on shortwave radio. 
[08:16:33] <DrGibby> more information here: https://priyom.org/military-stations/russia/the-buzzer
[08:17:48] <Cl0udNinja> what do you mean 'back'? did it stop for a while and only recently restart or something?
[08:18:20] <DrGibby> you can usually find a SDR in the region to listen live, or listen somewhat live, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUgzv-8_EMc
[08:19:38] <DrGibby> Ukrainian pirate radio operators have been broadcasting on the same frequency since russia escalated things recently
[08:19:38] <DrGibby> this is the first time this evening, the 'buzzer' is back 
[08:20:10] <Cl0udNinja> this evening? so it does this every night then?
[08:20:20] <Cl0udNinja> (the stopping / starting)
[08:20:52] <DrGibby> at least from what I've heard
[08:20:59] <DrGibby> the buzz should be every 1.2 (iirc) uninterrupted 24/7/365
[08:21:45] <DrGibby> see https://twitter.com/IntelDoge/status/1486170730354073602 for a lengthy number of examples of how Ukrainian pirates are fucking with the russians

[08:23:57] <DrGibby> On other words, I've always heard 'the buzzer' and tonight was the first time I've ever heard signals interrupted. I haven't been listening every day or anything, just on occasion
[08:24:31] <Cl0udNinja> ah I see. so someones fuckin with it to make it stop, not 'it just suddenly started transmitting again after a long silence'
[08:25:01] <Kiernian> it was legitimately transmitting as recently as december of 2020 from what I can see
[08:25:20] <DrGibby> It was speculatied that the buzzer was a dead man's switch at some point, essentially, if it wasn't being broadcast it was for subs to launch nukes. But they moved the antenna at some point and that was dispelled
[08:25:58] <DrGibby> Correct, Cl0udNinja. With the recent escalations in the Ukraine it's obvious that the pirates are screwing with the Russians in any capacity that they can

[10:39:41] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[10:39:53] <JollyRgrs> i find more fun in things like calling the trunk of a car the boot
[10:40:17] <monr0e> I honestly don't know where "boot" came from. Trunk is actually a mroe sensibel name
[10:40:20] <JollyRgrs> and a woman's private area is the "fanny" (which is what polite grandmas in America call the buttox)
[10:40:31] <monr0e> Uh
[10:40:33] <JollyRgrs> it really draws me to ask the question about the naming of the fanny pack
[10:40:34] <Cl0udNinja> that also applies in NZ
[10:40:38] <Cl0udNinja> dont call it a fannypack
[10:40:41] <JollyRgrs> :P
[10:40:41] <Cl0udNinja> you'll get punched in the face
[10:40:47] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: what do you call it?
[10:40:49] <Cl0udNinja> idk
[10:40:51] <monr0e> The definition of fanny depends on what generation you asl
[10:40:55] <JollyRgrs> in US, it's 100% a fanny pack
[10:40:57] <Cl0udNinja> I just got told not to ever call it that lol
[10:40:58] <Kiernian> yeah, kevin smith said that's the whole reason for the revolutionary war. someone once said "fancy a bit of fanny fun?" and oOoOoOPS! Accidental backdoor!
[10:41:10] <monr0e> You can call it a fanny pack if you want, nobody will misunderstand you
[10:41:26] <JollyRgrs> so i mean... it's just calling it a pussy purse, right?
[10:41:36] <monr0e> bum bag, coin purse, yada yada
[10:41:40] <JollyRgrs> where do you normally wear a fanny pack? for girls... it's right there
[10:41:46] <JollyRgrs> coin purse...
[10:41:48] <JollyRgrs> lol
[10:41:48] <monr0e> Again, the definition of fanny depends on the generation you ask
[10:41:49] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[10:41:50] <JollyRgrs> don't say that one

[10:46:05] <SirSceptalot> eesh
[10:46:26] <SirSceptalot> maybe could have gone for "less lethal" like salt or whatever
[10:46:39] <monr0e> Frankly I believe that explanation to be a backwards applied context
[10:46:50] <Cl0udNinja> apparently boobytrapping in general is completely illegal
[10:46:54] <Cl0udNinja> which is really fucked up
[10:47:08] <Cl0udNinja> cant protect yourself, but they wont do shit to the people breaking in
[10:47:24] <Kiernian> I think it's because there are situations where trespassing could be eventually ruled "not" illegal
[10:47:25] <monr0e> Boobytrapping is illegal in most places, because you cannot be certain that the person impact by that trap will be the intended target
[10:47:48] <SirSceptalot> exactly
[10:47:58] <monr0e> For example, if there is a situational emergency, that impacted person could be a member fo the emergency services

[10:50:33] <monr0e> er
[10:50:36] <JollyRgrs> IANAFF
[10:50:47] <monr0e> I have a differing opinion
[10:50:55] <SirSceptalot> JollyRgrs, bless you
[10:50:58] <JollyRgrs> door on fire vs door ENGULFED IN AN INFERNO
[10:51:07] <JollyRgrs> one is a little on fire
[10:51:09] <JollyRgrs> one is a LOT ON FIRE
[10:51:38] <Cl0udNinja> MUCH FIRE
[10:51:57] <monr0e> there's no way to tell what material an object on fire is made of, thus any amount of on fire is too much on fire. A key ingredient or component of that object could be an accelerent or explosive
[10:52:12] <JollyRgrs> monr0e: really?
[10:52:16] <monr0e> well, yes
[10:52:22] <monr0e> look at grenfell
[10:52:49] <monr0e> They had no idea until after the fact that the *entire outside of the building* was hihgly flammable
[10:53:10] <Cl0udNinja> ..
[10:53:20] <JollyRgrs> 99% of front doors will be solid wood (or have glass and wood)... back doors might be either solid wood or maybe metal... garage doors (interrior, but to the garage) most likely a metal door... and interior are hollow wood
[10:53:20] <Cl0udNinja> ISNT THAT WHAT FIRE SAFTEY AND BUILDING INSPECTIONS ARE TO PREVENT!?

[10:53:43] <JollyRgrs> FF can tell if building is brick, block, or just wood framing pretty easily
[10:53:52] <JollyRgrs> I can... and that's not my job to assess a building on fire
[10:54:05] <monr0e> Cl0udninja: Well yeah, but it didn't help that the (US based) company that created the material lied about its flammability and staged tests. 
[10:54:12] <Cl0udNinja> https://i.imgur.com/rQcMOcBh.jpg
[10:54:16] <JollyRgrs> can they tell if it was doused in gasoline before the fire? no... but they sure as hell would see the results of it
[10:54:29] <Cl0udNinja> monr0e, I dont understand how that even happened..
[10:54:32] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja++
[10:54:34] <SirSceptalot> "too much fire"
[10:54:44] <Cl0udNinja> everything is UL tested to be legally allowed for use for that kind of stuff
[10:54:58] <Cl0udNinja> if not UL its tested by other standards, which are all 3rd party companies
[10:55:21] <Cl0udNinja> something stinks of bullshit, and I think it might be you monr0e 
[10:55:39] <JollyRgrs> lol... monr0e "This was due to the building's cladding and the external insulation, since the air gap between them enabled the stack effect"
[10:55:46] <JollyRgrs> yeah... that's not "code" in US
[10:56:16] <JollyRgrs> even in single-family dwellings, there's fireblocks in place so flames can't just have a field day
[10:57:14] <monr0e> That was only part of the problem. The inner part of the cladding was made of some petroleum product that was flammable beyond reasonability. That, and the product was incorrectly made (IIRC) in that no part of the product sealed against the surface of the building.
[10:57:23] <JollyRgrs> also... this issue wasn't what material it was made out of... it was the huge oxygen shafts that were provided to fuel the fire
[10:58:06] <monr0e> ACM and polyethylene
[10:58:07] <JollyRgrs> "hey guys... so this one super special (AND SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED) case... so yeah, no one can ever really tell what they are going into because of that"
[10:58:11] <JollyRgrs> ...
[10:58:32] <monr0e> I mean, look at any rendered building. The render obscures the material underneath ti
[10:58:52] <JollyRgrs> that's why there are inspections prior to occupancy being granted
[10:58:57] <monr0e> Could be eighty year old walls with eighty year old insulation that is dry as fuck and burns like hair
[10:58:59] <JollyRgrs> again, at least in USA
[10:59:03] <Cl0udNinja> yes... however for that building to have been built, there is a fuckin metric asston of inspections and paperwork and verifications gone through
[10:59:29] <Cl0udNinja> all insulation is dry..
[10:59:30] <Cl0udNinja> wtf
[10:59:36] <JollyRgrs> and firefighters will know "oh snap, that's that OLD building, we should be extra careful"
[10:59:46] <SirSceptalot> lol. Building burned down. Reason? Render did not state flammability of final building material
[10:59:47] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: but maybe it's a little dry or "A LOT DRY!!!!!!" lol
[10:59:58] <Cl0udNinja> heh
[11:00:05] <Cl0udNinja> drier than a nuns pussy?
[11:00:13] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udNinja: who said they are dry?

[11:01:04] <monr0e> Insulation has a natural moisture cycle. It's why you don't put vapour barrier over the paper-lined side of the insulation
[11:02:03] <Cl0udNinja> random question for anyone who plays spacegames...
[11:02:21] <JollyRgrs> i played Descent back in the day, does that count?
[11:02:29] <Cl0udNinja> does anyone else always find that they feel more comfortable when their head is pointed upward at a specific direction
[11:02:43] <JollyRgrs> in space, what is "upward"?
[11:02:44] <Cl0udNinja> like if you turn your body in game upside down, you feel funky, and things dont feel right
[11:03:01] <monr0e> Are you talking about in VR?
[11:03:03] <Cl0udNinja> right but thats my point, I guess what I mean is that I find a specific orientation less disorienting than others
[11:03:11] <JollyRgrs> in space, there is no up or down
[11:03:12] <Cl0udNinja> no, FPS
[11:03:13] <JollyRgrs> iunno
[11:03:39] <monr0e> I've never had that issue. Although I haven't played space engineers in years, it's mostly Elite and Eve these days
[11:03:41] <JollyRgrs> I mean... when i play space games, I don't really think about up/down. I'm always relative to my ship
[11:04:09] <JollyRgrs> and once you get close enough to a planet, then gravity and it's normal anyways
[11:04:14] <JollyRgrs> GOOD NIGHT!
[11:04:38] <Cl0udNinja> idk I just feel weird if I'm oriented other than a specific way when I'm out in space

[13:08:40] <SirSceptalot> Yes, not that I really feel like it
[13:08:46] <lancehead> Have the intern write you something that prints out the website that currently has the largest amount of HD porn on it
[13:08:50] <teh_f4ll3n> Kiernian, I blend my own. Every time I ask for a cup at a cafe, it's different. EVERY DAMN TIME
[13:09:05] <Kiernian> I KNOW?!?! How do they DO that?!?
[13:09:18] <lancehead> Lemme guess, same cafe too 
[13:09:24] <teh_f4ll3n> sometimes
[13:09:27] <lancehead> lol\
[13:09:31] <SirSceptalot> I should have specified that I'm looking for useful script ideas :p
[13:09:45] <lancehead> That is useful depending on your priorities 
[13:09:46] <teh_f4ll3n> that qualifies as useful
[13:10:15] <Kiernian> unlikely. I haven't ordered it anywhere in years. Most brands manage to screw up the teabags themselves. Could use it as oil of bergamot potpourri for a year in your sock drawer
[13:10:20] <SirSceptalot> well at this point I'm thinking that "useful" is "shit that keeps him occupied long enough for me to think of a new task"
[13:10:22] <lancehead> When he arrives, just lead with "hey so I have a porn addiction. Oh also, I'm <name>"

[13:24:28] <Cl0udNinja> oops, scrollback :|
[13:24:35] <lancehead> lol 
[13:25:37] <Cl0udNinja> just had the weirdest bug in fallout4...
[13:25:46] <lancehead> Ooo I mod fallout 4 a lot
[13:25:48] <lancehead> What happened 
[13:26:02] <Cl0udNinja> a whole room full of enemies and friendlies became invincible, and were having an endless battle
[13:26:16] <lancehead> Ahh
[13:26:18] <lancehead> Do you have mods?
[13:26:19] <Cl0udNinja> I couldnt kill anyone, and mostly they ignored me
[13:26:22] <Cl0udNinja> some
[13:26:31] <Cl0udNinja> never had this happen before though
[13:26:31] <lancehead> If any of them use heavy scripting, that can happen
[13:26:42] <lancehead> Engine doesn't like it and poops out sometimes 
[13:26:46] <Cl0udNinja> and because of all the madness, piper turned on me, and I had to put her down
[13:26:59] <lancehead> I've had that happen with a named raider that had a gun with 200+ damage... was not a fun time 
[13:27:17] <lancehead> I fought him (and died a lot) for like 10 minutes before realising
[13:27:29] <Cl0udNinja> battling it out with bunker hill (friend) and the brotherhood (foe)
[13:27:42] <Cl0udNinja> so of course it was like 3 power armor knights
[13:27:55] <lancehead> Imagine not pledging your life to the Brotherhood of Steel
[13:27:57] <Cl0udNinja> I had to escape the room by spamming my stimpacks
[13:28:03] <lancehead> Ad Victoriam btw 
[13:28:14] <Cl0udNinja> Ive decided to side with the railroad this time
[13:28:38] <lancehead> I started with the railroad, then went double agent and turned on them with the brotherhood when my character found Acadia
[13:29:08] <Cl0udNinja> I left the minutemen sitting in their museum crying about their lack of leadership
[13:29:16] <lancehead> fuck the minutemen 
[13:29:17] <Cl0udNinja> I've had no/minimal contact with brotherhood

[13:30:13] <Cl0udNinja> I've been in this wasteland all of 5 minutes and you want me to go help every tom dick and harry on the block while your men have been here for 200 years and aint done shit
[13:30:42] <lancehead> Partly why I pick the Brotherhood, they at least have a noticeable presence
[13:30:58] <lancehead> All the vertibirds and knights around make it seem like you're *actually* doing something 
[13:31:34] <lancehead> (That and my power armor airdrop mod uses a vertibird to drop it, makes it more immersive)
[13:32:01] <Cl0udNinja> I'm pretty sure I'm just surgically welded to the inside of my powerarmor now
[13:32:03] <Cl0udNinja> it never comes off

[14:04:54] <Kiernian> does it actually say that in that wording?
[14:05:44] <Cl0udNinja> it did
[14:05:49] <Kiernian> holy crap, google returns 11,200 results for that exact phrase
[14:05:54] <Cl0udNinja> haha
[14:06:25] <Kiernian> https://old.reddit.com/r/softwaregore/comments/5j8s2e/i_hate_it_when_the_bios_does_not_be_installed/
[14:07:07] <Cl0udNinja> was an old AMD system I had. I used it and abused it for years. it sat in a hot area for a long time, and the caps started to fail. I kept using it until I was having to reboot it every 30 or so minutes, and the last boot before I gave up, it gave that message
[14:07:21] <Cl0udNinja> but it was a corrupted message too
[14:07:33] <Kiernian> a few of the other results mention popped caps as well.
[14:09:13] <Cl0udNinja> pretty sure every cap on the board had oozed by the time it died
[14:10:49] <Kiernian> the fact that it could output anything at all from anything to anything at that point is truly impressive
[14:11:39] <Cl0udNinja> I was amazed that it was able to even detect that the bios supposedly wasnt installed.. let alone put anything on the screen
[14:12:04] <Cl0udNinja> it wouldnt even beep the speaker, it apparently 'no bios' is an unaccounted for beep code
[14:12:30] <Kiernian> my guess is that message can only be relayed when nothing of the BIOS reports back at all. Like hard-coded static
[14:12:41] <Kiernian> or some kind of test pattern
[14:13:28] <Cl0udNinja> yeah idk, maybe a separate chip, or something hidden in the cpu code
[14:13:29] <Kiernian> one lonely little circuit somewhere that just has the code for "display this" burned into it
[14:15:39] <Kiernian> I want this book, wherever it is:
[14:15:40] <Kiernian>  Shanghai's Luwan District published a controversial "Bilingual Instruction of Luwan District for Expo" phrasebook with English terms and Chinese characters approximating pronunciation: "Good morning! (古得猫宁)" [pronounced gǔ dé māo níng] (which could be literally translated as "ancient cat tranquility")
[14:16:12] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[14:19:40] <Kiernian> That's not a flock of angry birds screaming in unison outside my window, that's someone's diesel engine complaining that it's -15F

[14:23:23] <lancehead> cl0udninja: did you see that video i linked? 
[14:24:09] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, sorry I got distracted.. that was pretty rough. kinda reminds me of the mirelurk queen I found... in the dark, in close quarters

[15:47:32] <signofzeta> @telgareith: I think MS released a cumulative Win7 update a few years back that included everything up to that point. they haven't updated it since, though.
[15:47:54] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> well a few years back is after win7 went EOL

[15:50:35] <signofzeta> that'll be a good starting point, but it'll still need to update itself.
[15:51:06] <xe0n> you'll need that + a few other prereqs, then the monthly rollups.
[15:51:11] <signofzeta> per the article, you'll need to get a newer SSU as well.
[15:52:05] <xe0n> you should be using the win7 sp1 iso from 15\02\11

[17:04:59] <xe0n> correct, use a task sequence to manage the deployment
[17:05:18] <xe0n> ie we have vmware templates, but theyre purely for hardware config
[17:05:31] <xe0n> (blank disk)
[17:05:41] <xe0n> something something pxe task sequence, good to go
[17:05:50] <xe0n> if your task sequences are "slow", work on optimising them
[17:05:57] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> ah, I get you. See, my issue is I'm also working with the guys to make streamline our deployments in azure and hte like as well. Thought process was to build ideal images with packer and output as various artifacts, i.e. builds a vhdx, an azure image, an ami, etc

[17:21:03] <PattyCakes> Speaking of shit heads, man I almost had to shoot a fucking spectrum guy yesterday. My house backs up to a major road, so a lot of utilities are in the yards of those people. Spectrum came by, asked to see if they could check in the backyard to see if their tap was back there (fun fact, it's not). I explained, no there isn't and here's where I fucked up. I opened my damn mouth and said "Only thing back there is my Comcast box".....Yup right as
[17:21:03] <PattyCakes>  the words left my mouth, I knew it was gonna be a long day. "Sir, you can't have comcast, this is a spectrum neighborhood".

[17:53:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> https://community.mimecast.com/s/article/Mergers-and-Acquisitions-839463807
[17:53:50] <csws> @Phorcys you're missing the "Domain" option in the opendkim settings?
[17:54:02] <sd> 14<P​horcys> you're not supposed to need it though no?
[17:54:04] <xe0n> When two Mimecast customer organizations merge, it is usually required that all archived data be transferred into one storage account. Customers choose this option in order to have a single archive, and to manage all internal users in one account. Later in this article, we will cover the considerations for extracting and importing data, and managing the user migration.
[17:54:09] <xe0n> so they both use mimecast currently?
[17:54:10] <csws> this dodgy guide on the internet says you do
[17:54:18] <csws> Domain (dataset)
[17:54:18] <csws> A set of domains whose mail should be signed by this filter. Mail from other domains will be verified rather than being signed.
[17:54:18] <csws> This parameter is not required if a SigningTable is in use; in that case, the list of signed domains is implied by the lines in that file.
[17:54:18] <csws> This parameter is ignored if a KeyTable is defined.

[17:54:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> One uses another product and the other is a black box atm.
[17:55:01] <xe0n> that's what the service is implying, both sides are mimecast customers
[17:55:03] <xe0n> yeah
[17:55:03] <sd> 14<P​horcys> but I had that before and commented it so I don't know if it'll change anything
[17:55:07] <csws> seems to suggest you don't need it
[17:55:10] <csws> yeah
[17:55:14] <csws> since you have a keytable
[17:55:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah it definitely does
[17:55:17] <xe0n> so you'd need to migrate them to mimecast, and then have them do the thing
[17:55:19] <sd> 14<P​horcys> yup
[17:55:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> yup
[17:55:33] <xe0n> stub accounts seem best..
[17:55:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah 
[17:55:41] <xe0n> glhf
[17:55:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> cleanest
[17:56:10] <AnonymooseReddtr> that was my original suggestion.  Stub accounts in a single tenant for day 1.  migrate the data when feasible.

[17:56:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> yup
[17:56:39] <xe0n> then it's just adding an additional domain, configuring the accounts already there, then adding some additional accounts

[22:49:23] <erpderp32> pop in and fix an end point
[22:49:26] <vinrock> yeah estranger and the people online i see comparing that event to other things that happen recently have no fuckin clue
[22:49:29] <erpderp32> or do it remotely with an mdm solution
[22:49:31] <vinrock> that grosses me out
[22:49:37] <mistiry> idk what you guys are arguiung about, but webex, zoom, etc aren't Remote Desktop apps. 
[22:49:44] <erpderp32> you are using a better MDM solution than Intune right?
[22:49:51] <PwnHoaX> All of those require the same number of steps to allow me to access the system, if not more.
[22:50:13] <erpderp32> Enable remote desktop in mdm > ping user > remote in
[22:50:28] <erpderp32> shit jamf just integrated TeamViewer iirc

[22:51:06] <PwnHoaX> You would think, but even from MDM you have to walk the user through the permissions, because security
[22:51:15] <erpderp32> what mdm are you using?
[22:51:25] <AdmiralNines> holy crap, i haven't heard of backorifice in decades. is it still around?
[22:51:29] <mistiry> i was joking about VNC. dont use VNC AdmiralNines.
[22:51:33] <erpderp32> jamfs remote desktop push command enables all the sharing settings
[22:51:34] <estranger> AdmiralNines, haah doubt it

[22:53:12] <erpderp32> PwnHoaX: what issues were seeing with mdm deployment? I never had any and we had our Windows techs remote in to user macOS just fine
[22:53:22] <PwnHoaX> Accessibly and Screen Recording permissions are not able to be set via profile due to security concerns, per Apple documentation and the last time we revisited. Granted this was a year ago
[22:53:38] <erpderp32> 4000 macOS devices across 22 locations + remote
[22:53:52] <AdmiralNines> man you're taking me back. Back in the day of Win98se and ICQ
[22:54:06] <erpderp32> PwnHoaX: I'll need to look into it. That's wild because it never came up for us lol
[22:54:41] <erpderp32> i haven't checked if jamfs PPPC utility can do it yet, i always manually wrote mine out for config profiles
[22:57:09] <PwnHoaX> erpderp32: After the toolset is in place it requires the user to allow two sets of permissions for our techs to remotely control the device. This is the designed functionality direct from Apple. If when it was installed the tech did the permisioning then the user never sees it but blindly leading a braindead enduser through a braindead OS slows the process down all because Apple wants to be "secure"

[23:38:35] <mikespears> also felda wtaf
[23:38:45] <mikespears> my tiny fucking 1 man biz uses M365
[23:38:46] <MarsSpiral> how many of u guys would take a paycut
[23:38:55] <MarsSpiral> from like 2 days a week WFH to
[23:39:02] <mikespears> MarsSpiral: hell no
[23:39:05] <MarsSpiral> going to office every few months
[23:39:10] <mikespears> yea fuck thaty
[23:39:12] <mikespears> that*
[23:39:18] <MarsSpiral> im thinking about it lol
[23:39:30] <mikespears> nah you're better off finding another job
[23:39:36] <MarsSpiral> nah i mean paycut as in
[23:39:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> naw
[23:39:37] <MarsSpiral> new job
[23:39:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> i WFH full time and would not take a paycut
[23:39:52] <MarsSpiral> like would you go for a new job that gives 99% wwfh
[23:39:56] <mikespears> you should be able to get a pay increase by job hopping unless you're being overpaid
[23:39:57] <MarsSpiral> but has lower pay then current job
[23:40:04] <mikespears> FUCK NO
[23:40:04] <koollman> why take a pay cut for something that costs less to your job ?
[23:40:09] <mikespears> ^
[23:40:14] <MarsSpiral> cause WFH is in demand and competition is harder
[23:40:17] *** Quits: spstarr (~spstarr@fedora/spstarr) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:40:29] <MarsSpiral> like logically ur right
[23:40:34] <MarsSpiral> but the reality is that WFH jobs are harder to get
[23:40:40] <mikespears> so you're willing to take a paycut because you're a slacker and can't differentiate yourself?
[23:40:41] <mikespears> got it
[23:40:46] <mikespears> bullshit
[23:40:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> what
[23:40:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> they are not
[23:40:59] <MarsSpiral> really 
[23:41:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> I'm ~8 months into my new role
[23:41:09] <mikespears> maybe I'm fucking awesome, but getting WFH jobs is easy as fuck
[23:41:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> which is my second full time WFH job
[23:41:14] *** Joins: br14 (~rick@lostbuthappy.net)
[23:41:19] <MarsSpiral> maybe im being unrealistic
[23:41:25] <mikespears> I've pretty much always been WFH since I started working in 2012
[23:41:25] <koollman> MarsSpiral: they were hard to get. This is changing quickly
[23:41:29] <MarsSpiral> i work in finance industry in High COL living area
[23:41:34] <MarsSpiral> i cant find any wfh places that pay similiar
[23:41:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> and 
[23:41:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> I moved to my current job for almost a 50% raise
[23:41:55] <MarsSpiral> was wondering if it was worth to go for a lower paying job, then move out of high col place
[23:41:57] <mikespears> ah so you live in a place with shitty politics that inflate prices
[23:42:02] <mikespears> got it
[23:42:07] <MarsSpiral> ya pretty much it
[23:42:11] <MarsSpiral> artificial housing crisis
[23:42:13] <mikespears> yep mover
[23:42:14] <fritzwastaken> This whole r/antiwork thing is fuggin hillarious
[23:42:15] <mikespears> move*
[23:42:17] <fritzwastaken> god damned neckbeards
[23:42:24] <MarsSpiral> my rent is like 1800 for a 1 bedroom
[23:42:25] <MarsSpiral> lol
[23:42:39] <mikespears> honestly take a lower pay job if you need to, but I'd try and discuss with your current employer
[23:42:40] <vinrock> i pay 1800 for a 1br condo in the middle of nowhere
[23:42:44] <mikespears> wtf
[23:42:56] <mikespears> I pay 1450 for a 3/2 with a 2 care garage
[23:43:01] <mikespears> on 0.3 acre
[23:43:13] <MarsSpiral> honestly i don't really need but I want to, but at the same time i know its probably not a good move career wise in terms of salary potential
[23:43:13] <mikespears> car*
[23:43:14] <vinrock> yeah that would be at least $4k/mo here
[23:43:20] <mikespears> fuck that
[23:43:24] <ny0x> $1500 for 2/2
[23:43:33] <mikespears> vinrock: MarsSpiral come to FL
[23:43:33] <MarsSpiral> i call my place a 1 bedroom but its honestly
[23:43:37] <MarsSpiral> a fake 1 bedroom
[23:43:39] <mikespears> we have jobs and its cheap
[23:43:42] <MarsSpiral> more of a studio with a wall divider
[23:43:44] <vinrock> man i was gonna move to fl before i started working here
[23:43:45] <vinrock> now im stuck
[23:43:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> my mortgage payment is $1600 a month
[23:44:03] <MarsSpiral> yeah but then u gotta move to florida lol
[23:44:10] <mikespears> FL isn't bad at all
[23:44:11] <vinrock> i actually really like florida
[23:44:12] <mikespears> honestly
[23:44:15] <vinrock> ^
[23:44:26] <vinrock> ive ben all over the country and have a good idea whats out there
[23:44:27] <MarsSpiral> @anonymoosereddtr houses in my city are at min 1 mil+
[23:44:29] <vinrock> florida is pretty damn nice
[23:44:36] <mikespears> only reason florida man is a thing is due to the sunshine laws, makes anything criminal wise public record
[23:44:52] <MarsSpiral> idk i dont want to get lynched by your local klansmen, i guess places like miami can't be that bad tho
[23:44:59] <mikespears> what the fuck
[23:45:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> oh MarsSpiral they are nuts here too but I bought 6 years ago
[23:45:14] <vinrock> lol miami is the one part im not fond of
[23:45:16] <mikespears> I've met more racists in VA and MA then I've ever seen or dealt with in FL
[23:45:20] <MarsSpiral> ok i was being hyperbolic but i was worried about racists in fl 
[23:45:21] <vinrock> you feel like a fucking LOSER if you dont have a lamborghini
[23:45:24] <mikespears> nah fam
[23:45:27] <mikespears> its not a thing
[23:45:40] <mikespears> like it is
[23:45:43] <mikespears> but its so minor
[23:45:45] <vinrock> mars im not white and i spent years wrking in the deep south
[23:45:49] <vinrock> its far more racist up north
[23:45:56] <mikespears> the worst racists I've ever seen are up north
[23:46:01] <vinrock> that is the truth
[23:46:05] <MarsSpiral> eh in my experience
[23:46:15] <MarsSpiral> ppl in the north do a lot more microaggressions and casual racism
[23:46:24] <mikespears> ^
[23:46:25] <MarsSpiral> ppl in the midwest and south if they are racist tend to be a lot more blatant
[23:46:32] <vinrock> up north you see legit racism
[23:46:34] <mikespears> yep, and easier to educate against it
[23:46:35] <vinrock> in the south its more shit talking
[23:46:41] <mikespears> in the midwest/south
[23:46:47] <vinrock> but in the south, i constantly saw everyone working and living together
[23:46:52] <vinrock> up north, fuck no
[23:46:52] <mikespears> if you're a decent person you're mostly good
[23:47:31] <MarsSpiral> but yeah, honestly i dont think most finance places are doing 100% wfh
[23:47:45] <MarsSpiral> and i think finance and tech pays the most in IT
[23:47:50] <mikespears> bullshit
[23:48:02] <mikespears> everything pays great once you're out of helpdesk
[23:48:12] <mikespears> I'm a jr sysadmin making 75k
[23:48:24] <vinrock> thats pretty kickass in fl
[23:48:28] <mikespears> I finally properly pivoted out of support
[23:48:35] <MarsSpiral> im a sysadmin 100k with regular 15-30% bonus with 10-15% equity every year too 
[23:48:48] <MarsSpiral> i dont think most places can compete w/ that unless its a hedgefund
[23:48:53] <mikespears> https://penske.jobs/tampa-fl/aws-cloud-engineer/074B3DB6FF2B4BA98EB3727D8D45939F/job/
[23:49:00] <mikespears> we're looking for AWS folks
[23:49:09] <mikespears> I think that's around 80k on the aws side
[23:49:26] <MarsSpiral> lol i need to learn aws, thats another thing. i get 0 opportunity to touch any cloud computing stuff at my current job cause of silo
[23:49:30] <vinrock> i have a buddy thats an aws guy in atl and hes bringing in $120k
[23:49:33] <vinrock> same age as me
[23:49:35] <mikespears> see that's bullshit MarsSpiral 
[23:49:39] <vinrock> i thought that sounded pretty good for the south
[23:49:41] <MarsSpiral> devops makes bank
[23:49:42] <mikespears> you can learn shit on your own time
[23:49:47] <MarsSpiral> yeah im learning azure on my own time
[23:49:50] <MarsSpiral> w/ my homelab
[23:49:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> cloud cloud
[23:49:56] <mikespears> there's so many free aws resources
[23:49:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> good good
[23:50:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> OH
[23:50:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> speaking of azure
[23:50:03] <mikespears> even just get the aws cert
[23:50:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> I got my MS700 and MS720 certs :D
[23:50:39] <mikespears> also if you're a java dev, I know Penske is looking
[23:50:45] <mikespears> or know any java devs
[23:50:48] <MarsSpiral> honestly my most marketable skill is that i'm pretty comfortable w/ powershell 
[23:50:55] <MarsSpiral> def could pickup new languages if i put in the effort 
[23:50:58] <Cl0udNinja> maybe I just live in a high cost area, but 80k for devops AWS seems extra low, unless its jr devops
[23:50:59] <mikespears> also Android devs
[23:51:14] <mikespears> and iOS
[23:51:18] <MarsSpiral> yeah in my place Devops means guaranteed 100k+
[23:51:23] <MarsSpiral> realistically 120-160k
[23:51:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> if anyone is good with SCCM/Intune / Endpoint @ Scale thats an easy job to get now
[23:51:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> as well as Teams and voip
[23:51:36] <MarsSpiral> hey im good w/ teams and voip
[23:51:39] <Cl0udNinja> MarsSpiral, yep similar here
[23:51:41] <MarsSpiral> dont use sccm tho
[23:52:05] <MarsSpiral> should prolly set it up in my homelab
[23:52:05] <mikespears> also linkedin is your friend
[23:52:13] <MarsSpiral> yeah i use linkedin and indeed
[23:52:13] <Cl0udNinja> I just got a fat raise to bring me into range, as I undernegotiated myself during hiring
[23:52:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> eh sccm is kinda meh 
[23:52:25] <vinrock> good jerb Cl0udNinja 
[23:52:32] <MarsSpiral> I got hired at 65k and I got a 25% raise this year to bring me to 100k 
[23:52:38] <mikespears> nice
[23:52:38] <MarsSpiral> i think they realized im being underpaid
[23:52:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> The other space you could look to work in is security
[23:52:46] <MarsSpiral> or maybe they realized im looking for new job cause i kept taking
[23:52:48] <Jaelae> noice
[23:52:48] <MarsSpiral> half days and shit
[23:52:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> get good at Azure Sentinel and Defender
[23:52:53] <Cl0udNinja> I got a 10% raise, + a > 5k bonus
[23:52:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> guaranteed job
[23:53:01] <mikespears> I'm gonna ask for a raise after I get my IBM WebSphere Administrator training in march
[23:53:05] <MarsSpiral> honestly 10% is pretty good all things considered too

[23:53:25] <MarsSpiral> cause i feel cloud shit is the path to money and more WFH jobs
[23:53:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> yes it is
[23:53:33] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, I wasnt even askin for anything they just gave it, so.. I cant complain lol
[23:54:16] <Jaelae> most should definitely learn google cloud, aws, and azure - on the fundamentals / associate track to get a base knowledge of each. then figure it out from there
[23:54:20] <Jaelae> so many companies using it
[23:54:23] <Cl0udNinja> I dont even do a lot of cloud shit, I just happen to be the one with the most cloud knowledge here, aside from the CTO
[23:54:28] <Jaelae> we use all three currenty for prod along with on premise
[23:54:33] <MarsSpiral> i do 0 aws/azure/gcp work
[23:54:36] <Cl0udNinja> most of my days are doing... all kinds of shit
[23:54:40] <Jaelae> but we struggle hiring 
[23:54:43] <MarsSpiral> my only cloud experience really is 365, azure ad, and saas products
[23:54:51] <mikespears> I'll be honest, I'm happy at my day job, but I want my business to really take off
[23:54:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> MarsSpiral thats all i do man

[23:55:37] <Cl0udNinja> and I've been helping teach the devs more about writing ansible
