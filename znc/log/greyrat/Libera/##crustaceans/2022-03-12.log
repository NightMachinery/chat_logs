[00:58:38] <defect> well, we're still here
[00:59:37] <kronk> are we though?
[01:01:26] <gwozniak> I felt nothing transitioning to the next life, if that's what happened
[01:05:20] <gwozniak> Maybe... we are transitioning to lives all the time.  *mind blown*
[01:30:12] <kronk> that's thought leader talk.

[17:37:58] <gwozniak> g'day
[17:38:35] <gwozniak> Trying to find a decent video outlining the procedure of tobacco harvesting as I did it when I was young and I am not having any luck
[17:38:54] <gwozniak> Found an interesting film from the 50s, though
[17:39:52] <river> oh you did this?
[17:40:26] <river> was it with some nonstandard technique?
[17:42:46] <gwozniak> No, it was reasonably standard at the time, but the trick is finding something that shows it.  Lots of what I'm finding is more recent equipment
[17:43:29] <gwozniak> I found one but it's overlayed with a somewhat iconic song about tobacco farming, with some silly effects put in by whoever made the video
[17:50:08] <gwozniak> Ah, found one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZeyZSCQVXw

[17:50:53] <gwozniak> Aside from videographer, I have done all the jobs shown in that
[18:18:05] <gwozniak> This is what is was like before my time, but I did a little of this as well.

[19:17:22] <cb> i didnt know ontario had the climate for tobacco
[19:17:41] <cb> i thought you had to be in like virginia for it
[19:24:38] <gwozniak> Yeah, it's pretty much perfect here (in the southern part)
[19:24:56] <gwozniak> Nearly every farm was growing tobacco when I was growing up
[19:25:23] <gwozniak> Still some there, just less of it
[19:46:12] <kronk> allo.

[23:39:24] <river> why doesnt russia take out ukraines power or internet?
[23:39:43] <Brekkjern> ,
[23:39:59] <Brekkjern> How would Russia communicate with their troops if the internet or power grid were down?
[23:40:07] <Brekkjern> Their radios don't seem to work :P
[23:55:21] <river> do you think thats why they dont do it?
[23:55:26] <river> i guess it could be
