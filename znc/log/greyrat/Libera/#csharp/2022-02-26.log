[00:00:02] <ki9a> yep
[00:00:14] <Nasp> The reason i asked about the render is i assume there will be power sockets in the wall
[00:00:16] <ki9a> stairs/hallway upstairs are carpet; I want carpet in the rooms too, my wife does not
[00:00:20] <ki9a> there will be
[00:00:22] <ki9a> left and right
[00:00:25] <ki9a> in the back
[00:00:28] <ki9a> not next to the stove
[00:00:42] <Nasp> I dont get people who have carpets next to the stove
[00:00:57] <ki9a> me neither
[00:01:33] <Nasp> I've seen twice entrepreneurs forgetting power sockets
[00:01:43] <Nasp> Although it wasn't in a private home, but still quite impressive

[00:02:32] <Nasp> If completely new i assume pyrolytic oven as well?
[00:02:53] <lz_> I'm starting to thing maybe i should have kept my ears closed
[00:02:53] <ki9a> whats that
[00:03:09] <Nasp> ki9a:  Oven that heats to a high temperature to be self cleaning
[00:03:16] <ki9a> oh it has that too!

[00:03:55] <ki9a> probably one of the most expensive things in the house really
[00:03:57] <MatthiasVance> Pyrolytic yes but you still have to take out everything
[00:04:08] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yeah the sides for holding the plates
[00:04:16] <Nasp> For some reason they can't figure out how to make those parts withstand the heat
[00:04:17] <MatthiasVance> yeah
[00:04:23] <Nasp> IT makes zero sense
[00:04:34] <MatthiasVance> I'm like .. I would buy that for comfort, don't make me take out everything..
[00:04:47] <ki9a> this was more like
[00:04:51] <ki9a> you couldn't pick this option
[00:04:54] <ki9a> it was just included
[00:05:13] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yeah exactly
[00:05:20] <Nasp> "It's a 100 euro addon"
[00:05:22] <Nasp> Sure thing, dont care
[00:05:38] <ki9a> but the house itself had a lot of those things
[00:05:50] <MatthiasVance> We went for IKEA kitchen btw, not doing that again. Kitchen itself is mighty fine but appliances I'd buy separate next time
[00:05:51] <ki9a> though more like "oh that's X thousand"
[00:06:17] <Nasp> Yeah all appliances are expensive
[00:06:18] <ki9a> want black instead of grey between the bricks? 1000
[00:06:22] <MatthiasVance> lol
[00:06:27] <MatthiasVance> new house right?
[00:06:29] <ki9a> extra lightbulbs? 1000

[00:06:38] <MatthiasVance> Yeah and they don't go off script to NOT do stuff...
[00:06:50] <Nasp> The new thing is to put in phillips hue for everything
[00:06:56] <ki9a> Oh that was fine actually
[00:07:02] <MatthiasVance> oh that's nice
[00:07:03] <Nasp> I've seen a few people do it, so each spot is phillips hue
[00:07:04] <ki9a> i dropped the stuff they normally put on the ceiling

[00:07:54] <ki9a> also swapped a few things around; like dropped opdek for stompe doors
[00:08:02] <ki9a> was a tiny addon
[00:08:05] <MatthiasVance> I have no clue what that is
[00:08:06] <MatthiasVance> :D
[00:08:16] <ki9a> opdek deur vs stompe deur?
[00:08:29] <ki9a> do your doors go into the frame or onto it?

[00:10:23] <ki9a> yep!
[00:10:27] <ki9a> stomp is nicer
[00:10:30] <Nasp> Are there advantages to the other, sound insulation maybe?
[00:10:31] <ki9a> opdek is cheaper
[00:10:47] <Nasp> My doors are like 80 years old :D
[00:10:51] <ki9a> often the doors are like carton inside :)
[00:11:05] <Nasp> And for some reason, the idiot who built this apartment complex decided that each door should have unique measurments

[00:12:17] <ki9a> i think there's like 5 standard widths
[00:12:21] <ki9a> for doors
[00:12:34] <Nasp> So no garage, or just no door?
[00:12:39] <Nasp> Or gate i assume
[00:12:40] <ki9a> no garage door
[00:12:42] <ki9a> yeah
[00:12:45] <ki9a> a regular door ofc
[00:12:52] <Nasp> So it's open or you just can't drive your car into it

[00:13:43] <Nasp> Is it connected to the house so you dont ahve to go ourside to wash?
[00:13:53] <ki9a> connected
[00:13:59] <Nasp> Ahh okay
[00:14:01] <ki9a> let me make a screenshot

[00:14:51] <Nasp> That looks huge

[00:15:12] <ki9a> main house is 10x7 inside
[00:15:26] <Nasp> What's the other part, the shed?
[00:15:31] <Nasp> Or office / business part?
[00:16:12] <Ownix> in SQL Server, and EntityFramework Core, a "uniqueidentifier" and Guide respectively
[00:16:13] <ki9a> the thing on the right connected is the shed
[00:16:20] <ki9a> the thing next to that is the neighbor
[00:16:21] <Ownix> Is the comparison case insensitive?
[00:16:29] <Ownix> Guid* not Guide...
[00:16:45] <ki9a> i think it's a guid internally so woldn't have a case Ownix

[00:17:02] <Ownix> gotcha, so I can do like .SingleOrDefault(x => x.InviteCode == new Guid(inviteCode));
[00:17:02] <ki9a> different angle
[00:17:08] <ki9a> yep
[00:17:13] <Ownix> You the man
[00:17:25] <Nasp> Ownix:  Where do you get the invitecode from
[00:17:37] <Ownix> a link in an email
[00:17:39] <Nasp> If it's web, just use a Guid, already there

[00:18:14] <Nasp> Yup
[00:18:26] <Nasp> Also remember the expire date :D

[00:18:47] <ki9a> want different bricks? 2000 euro

[00:19:28] <Ownix> Nasp: yeah im working on that now lol
[00:19:34] <ki9a> but it all depends on your frame of reference
[00:19:37] <Nasp> ki9a:  How many square meters btw
[00:19:55] <Nasp> ki9a:  So you are getting solar? But 1500 for one extra panel
[00:20:00] <ki9a> 3 extra
[00:20:11] <ki9a> groundfloor is 7x10; 1st floor is 7x10; 2nd floor is 7x10 but has angled roof
[00:20:24] <ki9a> requirement here (PV)
[00:20:29] <Nasp> Okay that's not crazy big
[00:20:34] <ki9a> exactly
[00:20:38] <ki9a> doesn't have to be
[00:20:42] <Nasp> It just looked that way
[00:21:30] <Nasp> Have you calculated that those 3 extra panels make a difference?
[00:21:34] <Nasp> And batteries as well?
[00:21:43] <ki9a> no batteries; I figure I can do that later
[00:21:51] <Nasp> Ownix:  Btw, ehm don't use guid
[00:22:10] <ki9a> I have 9 panels in total
[00:22:14] <Nasp> Ownix:  Or atleast consider that guids aren't that secure for links
[00:22:36] <ki9a> the 3 extra were on top of the 6 "included"

[00:23:43] <Nasp> Probably around 20
[00:23:59] <ki9a> i don't have that much roof :)
[00:24:07] <ki9a> for 20
[00:24:11] <Nasp> Ownix:  Just that Guids aren't necesarily random
[00:24:16] <Nasp> As in cryptographic random
[00:25:03] <Nasp> ki9a:  What did you mean with solar requirement
[00:25:08] <Nasp> Something you wanted or gov decided?
[00:25:35] <ki9a> govt yes
[00:25:45] <ki9a> so houses have to be (close to) neutral climate wise

[00:58:26] <irwiss> i like mostly milk chocolate, it's not sour at all and gives sugar rush if you eat enough of it
[00:58:58] <irwiss> bomb: nah definitely a coincidence someone drives that on main road in uncovered trucks
[00:59:39] <irwiss> also it's a fucking icbm, russia could put it on south pole and still have 100% coverage of ukraine, it's just a press release, nice move from putin

[01:08:38] <DevJohnC> Ownix, depends on the relationship between them: in this case I'd say a User owns an Invite, and thus is the principal
[01:09:05] <DevJohnC> but, the Invite -> User relationship you might have after the Invite is redeemed would have the Invite as the principal
[01:10:25] <Ownix> ha exactly DevJohnC the invite exists first, the user is created when they bounce through Auth0 (which they have to do to accept)

[01:20:44] <bomb> sysRPN there is a slim chance I'll be starting EE degree next September
[01:21:26] <sysRPN> for every component you can buy, there are two cheap versions that look the same but come from china and don't work so well fi at all
[01:21:47] <sysRPN> bomb: that's great! start reading the art of electronics
[01:22:06] <sysRPN> also
[01:22:29] <sysRPN> buy a siglent oscilloscope
[01:22:59] <sysRPN> that are chinese, but they actualyl have value, and are much cheaper than rigels
[01:23:13] <sysRPN> it's quite fun
[01:23:45] <sysRPN> because you can rip apart / destroy all your electronic crap for components, then lego them together inyour own circuits
[01:24:28] <sysRPN> and with today's world of pcb services, you can make professional looking experimental things
[01:24:33] <bomb> sysRPN oh man, I'll be using whatever the electronics lab the university has. I cannot afford an oscilloscope
[01:24:36] <Nasp> https://mobile.twitter.com/internetofshit/status/1466085696859480065 I kinda want this and use it for video meetings at owrk

[01:25:10] <sysRPN> bomb: my advice then ... meet some smart people at university and spend a lot of time at the lab making friends
[01:25:30] <xb0o2> Nasp: as in a standalone modem, no routing
[01:26:09] <Nasp> I have a cable modem i've set to bridge mode, does that count?
[01:26:20] <bomb> sysRPN I'm too dumb to make smart friends, but I'll give it a shot :)

[01:59:44] <sysRPN> bomb: i design pcbs and hand assemble them using through hole
[02:00:06] <sysRPN> though i might start using SMD ICs
[02:00:20] <sysRPN> they make a lot of really neat ICs these days
[02:00:34] <bomb> but that's very difficult to assemble new MCUs with tiny pins by hand, no?
[02:00:45] <sysRPN> pads not pins
[02:00:54] <sysRPN> and it's not that hard if you know what you are doing
[02:01:26] <bomb> SMD ICs are equivalent of circuits?
[02:01:26] <sysRPN> use flux, tin the pads, then hot air and the IC should seat itself
[02:01:35] <sysRPN> clear up with more flix and a wick if needed
[02:02:12] <sysRPN> an IC is just an integrated circuit. it's a small rectable with SMD pads that does a lot of things

[02:07:53] <sysRPN> inserting it hangs lsusb
[02:07:53] <bomb> okay, but a Cortex M0 has tiny legs, how do you mount that to a PCB? using that hot air technique?
[02:08:08] <sysRPN> i think it has pads not legs
[02:08:22] <sysRPN> there is a difference ... yes though hot air and flux
[02:08:25] <sysRPN> you need flux
[02:08:31] <MatthiasVance> Aeon Flux
[02:08:33] <JakeSays> bomb: you let the pcb assembler do it
[02:08:44] <JakeSays> bomb: or buy a breakout board
[02:08:48] <JakeSays> which is what i do
[02:09:13] <bomb> I want to make finished products with it JakeSays
[02:09:23] <sysRPN> flux the pads on the board use an iron to smear around solder, then use hot air to mount the chip
[02:09:47] <JakeSays> bomb: i would suggest starting with breakouts, etc until you get the design running
[02:10:03] <sysRPN> jiggle it with a fine tipped tweezers while hitting it with hot air, and it will seat itself
[02:10:15] <bomb> why can't PCB printing companies just assemble the parts as well?
[02:10:32] <JakeSays> bomb: also you can get mcu modules that have castellated edges for production mounting on pcbs
[02:10:47] <sysRPN> then clean up any joints if needed with the iron and finally clean the residue with alchohol a brush and lint free paper

[02:46:04] <Nasp> Aha
[02:46:24] <Nasp> I was thinking if it was because he was president of the council, it just seemed like a strange and bad idea
[02:47:16] <bomb> I still can't grasp the scope of the war. Russia is taking it slow for a reason, like leaving the door open for negotiation?

[02:48:38] <pandem> they're attacking as well as they can
[02:48:55] <pandem> what they could do is do more random bombing, but that makes outside intervention more likely

[02:49:11] <Nasp> Like embarg?

[02:50:40] <Nasp> And same with US
[02:50:52] <JakeSays> Nasp: nato might not, but the UN could

[03:59:33] <MatthiasVance> actual hot reload
[03:59:37] <MatthiasVance> for local development
[03:59:56] <MatthiasVance> I'm using Elmish (MVU)
[04:00:16] <MatthiasVance> There are ways to do it using PortaCode, but that's not really IL
[04:00:23] <Nasp> Dont know elmish
[04:00:34] <MatthiasVance> It's more for mobile devices where you can't just magically do stuff with IL
[04:00:35] <Nasp> But as in do you just want it to reload the site?
[04:00:38] <MatthiasVance> no
[04:00:50] <MatthiasVance> I want to replace the update and view methods
[04:00:54] <Nasp> Ok
[04:01:02] <Nasp> WE just had a meeting today where someone mentioned hot reload
[04:01:08] <Nasp> And he really just meant that it auto updated
[04:01:29] <MatthiasVance> Both are hot reload I guess.. but I'm aiming for stateful hot reload
[04:01:38] <Nasp> So elmish has hot reload support?
[04:01:48] <Nasp> Well this was for .NET service where he wanted hot reload on changes
[04:02:00] <Nasp> But what he meant was just run the update when there's an update
[04:02:49] <MatthiasVance> Elmish is just the MVU implementation not bound to anything else
[04:03:51] <MatthiasVance> "The goal of the architecture is to provide a solid UI-independent core to build the rest of the functionality around."
[04:04:25] <Nasp> Seems like other people have tried the same, maybe you can find some inspiration there
[04:04:54] <MatthiasVance> One person has had an experimental version .. 3 years ago
[04:04:59] <MatthiasVance> That's it

[04:07:30] <MatthiasVance> It's not related to Elmish
[04:07:40] <MatthiasVance> It's just that you have to take it into account when replacing things
[04:09:55] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: It's the same as if you have an MVC framework, but separate from the UI tech
[04:10:20] <Nasp> Not sure i follow
[04:11:01] <MatthiasVance> Imagine that your regular ASP.NET Core MVC application uses 1 part to support the CONCEPT OF views, controllers, models etc.. but is not bound to HTML.. now you can suddenly use MVC everywhere
[04:11:08] <MatthiasVance> Same goes for MVU
[04:11:37] <MatthiasVance> You can have an MVC console application for example
[04:14:19] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Better? :D
[04:15:30] <Nasp> Nope
[04:15:38] <MatthiasVance> lol
[04:15:50] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: What part are you missing?
[04:16:10] <Nasp> Elmish doesn't have hot reload support but you re building it?
[04:16:31] <Nasp> Although usually hot reload is jsut that you save the current state and restart the application really
[04:16:44] <Nasp> Or events based on how it's made
[04:16:55] <MatthiasVance> Elmish isn't a thing by itself
[04:17:37] <MatthiasVance> What stateful hot reload is supposed to do here: Take local changes, send them to the client, have the client figure out what to do with it
[04:18:06] <MatthiasVance> Only at the very end of that process, is Elmish involved, because you have to know what to replace in order to have it be stateful (because your Elmish structure is carrying that state)
[04:20:59] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: With C# they just use edit and continue for hot reload
[04:21:05] <MatthiasVance> There is no equivalent in F#
[04:21:19] <MatthiasVance> (yet)
[04:23:27] <JakeSays> that's because f# sucks

[04:29:53] *** Joins: Obsdark (~Obsdark@user/obsdark)
[04:29:57] <JakeSays> the ukrainians don't get to pick the english spelling
[04:30:02] <Obsdark> Hello people
[04:30:03] <Obsdark> a question
[04:30:19] <Obsdark> I have a list of an abstract class, let's call it Parent
[04:30:38] <Obsdark> and in this list i have instances of 3 child classes, ChildA, ChildB, ChildC
[04:31:12] <JakeSays> psaki nods too much
[04:31:22] <Obsdark> One of this child classes, let's say ChildB have some specific method than the other ones doesn't share, and than in the future, maybie an hipotetic new class called ChildD could use
[04:32:00] <Obsdark> I know than maybie the way to implement this specificallity will be making an interface and do ChildB inherit from it
[04:32:27] <Obsdark> But the question is, how can i detect in the list than the class of the item inherit from that interface?
[04:32:44] <MatthiasVance> if (item is IYourInterface someThing)
[04:33:03] <Obsdark> is will return me that?
[04:33:06] <Obsdark> are you certain?
[04:33:11] <MatthiasVance> I am not sure if you *should* though, because then every time you add a type you have to change that code
[04:33:20] <MatthiasVance> Obsdark: Yes, try it out
[04:33:29] *** Quits: jamea (~jamea@189.237.20.19) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:33:44] <Obsdark> Will try, thank you MatthiasVance
[04:33:52] <MatthiasVance> That I am certain doesn't mean I am right though ;)
[04:34:21] <Obsdark> What do you mean when you said "i am not sure if you Should"?
[04:34:41] <Obsdark> what code do you mean i will need to change?
[04:35:03] <Obsdark> I though on giving this to that child class through just like the specific of that child class and detect the attribute
[04:35:17] <Obsdark> but for some reason, Reflection's GetAttribute can't find it.
[04:35:56] <MatthiasVance> Don't use reflection
[04:36:16] <MatthiasVance> Obsdark: I mean that you maybe shouldn't because it smells like a broken design
[04:36:31] <MatthiasVance> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/tJrsidMQ/image.png
[04:36:42] * JakeSays uses reflection because he is just so damn good looking
[04:37:36] <Obsdark> Ok, why did smell like that?
[04:38:02] <MatthiasVance> Obsdark: Because every time you add something new like that, you have to change multiple places
[04:39:10] <brianonymous_> JakeSays: oh, i dunno if i told, omnicron got in the house
[04:39:27] <Obsdark> i'll keep it in mind MatthiasVance
[04:39:29] <Obsdark> thanks
[04:39:30] <brianonymous_> according to datas, it sounds like i got about a 39% chance of catching it
[04:39:42] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous_: How do you feel about that?
[04:40:04] <brianonymous_> just that i dont have time to be sick
[04:40:20] <MatthiasVance> Why not?
[04:40:23] <MatthiasVance> Does anyone ever?
[04:40:31] <brianonymous_> work shit.. and probably not
[04:40:51] <brianonymous_> my daughter said its the weirdest sickness she ever had
[04:40:55] <MatthiasVance>  What happens at your workplace when you are sick for .. 8 weeks for example?
[04:41:06] <brianonymous_> omg, right now that would be chaos
[04:41:20] <MatthiasVance> Sounds like a typical company :D
[04:41:21] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: oh? who was the unlucky recipient?
[04:41:26] <pandem> probably at some point you need a good reason
[04:41:29] <brianonymous_> JakeSays: my daughter
[04:41:35] <JakeSays> ah. poor girl
[04:41:53] <brianonymous_> shes not a happy camper right now
[04:41:58] <MatthiasVance> Let's hope for no extra stuff besides being sick for a few days
[04:42:21] <brianonymous_> yeah, i suspect i should be ok. i mean, i honestly dont know how i made it this long
[04:42:33] <MatthiasVance> Same, especially for people coming into work sniffling .. ffs
[04:42:36] <brianonymous_> i thought for SURE id get it last trip out west
[04:42:44] <MatthiasVance> (when I still had an office job)
[04:43:12] <MatthiasVance> I am pretty sure I will get it within the next couple of weeks
[04:43:17] <brianonymous_> seems like it
[04:43:22] <brianonymous_> making the last rounds
[04:43:29] <MatthiasVance> We have no more policies etc
[04:43:31] <MatthiasVance> As of today actually
[04:43:37] <brianonymous_> same, MD just shut em off as well
[04:43:38] <MatthiasVance> No mask mandate, no distancing anymore
[04:43:40] <MatthiasVance> ah
[04:43:48] <MatthiasVance> Feels more relaxed
[04:43:51] <MatthiasVance> You can just .. go places
[04:43:56] <brianonymous_> i think this one is the best one to do that with
[04:44:18] <MatthiasVance> Oh yes definitely, lots of people forgetting we only gave vaccines to the rich countries though
[04:44:28] <MatthiasVance> And will be surprised once it mutates somewhere and comes back
[04:44:48] <brianonymous_> the high infectious rate will be a huge bonus
[04:44:57] <brianonymous_> it should choke out the deltas and what not
[04:45:14] <MatthiasVance> Nice choice of words
[04:45:21] <MatthiasVance> But yeah!
[04:45:24] <brianonymous_> hah
[04:45:31] <MatthiasVance> Getting ready for that spring
[04:46:04] <MatthiasVance> And if we aren't all covered in nuclear fallout maybe we can enjoy at least summer before we get another deadlier mutation
[04:46:17] <brianonymous_> thats true, i bet gamma radiation is pretty effective
[04:46:57] <brianonymous_> the good thing is, historically speaking, virii trend toward more spread less harm
[04:47:00] <JakeSays> so there's an atomic lock that is accurate to 19 decimal places
[04:47:52] <JakeSays> it's so accurate that two of them can detect the differences in time down to .2mm
[04:48:06] <brianonymous_> millimeters?
[04:48:12] <JakeSays> yes
[04:48:22] <brianonymous_> ?UNIT MISMATCH ERROR LINE 20
[04:48:29] <JakeSays> LOL
[04:49:37] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: for you .0008"
[04:49:41] <JakeSays> er, .008"
[04:49:57] <brianonymous_> i dont understand what you mean - differences in time down to .2mm?
[04:50:27] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: time displacement
[04:50:37] <brianonymous_> oh
[04:50:41] <JakeSays> time runs faster .2mm higher
[04:50:47] <brianonymous_> oh i see, relativity
[04:51:09] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous_: So it matters less that some countries might have ~0 vaccinations?
[04:51:28] <JakeSays> in other words, einstein be a smart dude
[04:51:29] <MatthiasVance> I thought it could mutate more there into all kinds of shit
[04:52:05] <JakeSays> actually it's time dilation, not time displacement

[06:58:26] <bkool> Linux Mint! that's what I run too.
[06:58:38] <sysRPN> do you use cinnamon?
[06:58:39] <bkool> I finally switched off Ubuntu last year.
[06:58:54] <sysRPN> nice
[06:59:18] <sysRPN> the only extension i run is cinnamon maximus
[06:59:38] <sysRPN> which removes application title bars when maximized
[06:59:44] <bkool> yeah, I run the default UI. I may tweak it eventually
[06:59:47] <sysRPN> i've wrrite a few cinnamon applets
[06:59:59] <sysRPN> * written
[07:00:12] <sysRPN> i wrote a vpn applet and a microphone applet
[07:01:18] <sysRPN> the vpn applet blocks certain apps from running when the vpn is off, allows you to toggle the vpn on/off, shows you a list of servers, and provides a visual indication of you vpn status
[07:01:32] <bkool> I only have one annoyance so far with Mint. the keyboard settings keeps forgetting my settings. so when I press hold say the delete button it won't keep deleting. i have to go into app and disable and reenable.
[07:01:57] <sysRPN> the microphone applet mutes/unmutes your mic, allos you to slect mic input, and gives you a fixed mic volume slider
[07:02:04] <bkool> nice!
[07:03:26] <sysRPN> imo the desktop metaphors in cinnamon are probably the best refinement of any os
[07:03:44] <sysRPN> basically it's windows xp with some windows 7 enhancements

[12:44:51] <Miles8of9> bomb said Zelensky is no good
[12:46:26] <bomb> MatthiasVance he's supported by Soros, so he's pro-NATO. but turning an ex-Soviet country's direction to the west without offending the bear isn't an easy task. Zelenskiy failed at that

[12:52:18] <bomb> leaders gotta find the right balance, or their country suffers like this

[12:54:42] <lz_> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation
[12:58:21] <Miles8of9> putin wants to rebuild the soviet union... and ukraine is a rich country he can make profit of too
[12:59:19] <lz_> imagine what social media would have liked during ww2
[12:59:26] <lz_> would have looked like
[12:59:28] <bomb> oh you solved the entire mystery Miles8of9
[13:03:25] <Miles8of9> there is no mistery... austria would like to invade south tyrol... slovenia would like to take a piece of italian territory etc etc... they don't do it because other countries could attack them, but Russia has tons on nuclear missiles so there is no concern
[13:05:10] <Miles8of9> Putin can do whatever he wants because attacking Russia would mean the end of human life on earth...
[13:06:31] <lz_> Miles8of9: btw, when you were praising putin, was that a joke? I'm already ignoring the guy you're talking with so it's hard to follow, but if you're a pro putin guy I'd just be happy to remove you from my log as well
[13:08:22] <Miles8of9> i'm not pro putin... i said that any military action against Russia would mean massive nuclear bombing etc etc.. so none can stop him

[13:12:45] <bomb> Miles8of9 Russians have been expansionist for centuries
[13:14:15] <lz_> imo the root hard core problem is how russian people have been lied to for years and most of them believe anything their state tv is broadcasting
[13:14:15] <Miles8of9> we can't do more than that without causing the 3rd WW

[22:04:26] <bomb> so many pro-Ukrainian footage, but Russian army seems to be advancing
[22:04:56] <Nasp> This is a strange war
[22:05:07] <Nasp> Cellphones and recordings everywhere
[22:07:01] <jennie> there are live streams too
[22:07:14] <bomb> I'm afraid Russians will cut the internet off once they can :\
[22:07:17] <pandem> cell phones and war aren't exactly new
[22:07:57] <DoofusCanadensis> saw notes that Russia is starting to clamp down on social media
[22:08:13] <blezz> they're blocking facebook and twitter, afaik
[22:08:24] <DoofusCanadensis> they're going to have to shut down the internet altogether to have any hope of controlling the news
[22:08:24] <blezz> ukraine wanted help from musk with starlink
[22:08:25] <Nasp> Well twitter and facebook should block them too :D
[22:08:42] <Nasp> Imagine a russian free internet
[22:08:48] <Nasp> Just cut all the optics
[22:09:12] <DoofusCanadensis> meh, there's still radio
[22:09:31] <bomb> ugh, they're moving heavier motors https://twitter.com/lookner/status/1497619610715176965
[22:10:42] <bomb> I wonder if western countries use these incidents as an excuse to ban/restrict cryptocurrencies
[22:10:42] <blezz> bomb they'll atack kiev again tonight
[22:11:07] <bomb> blezz yeah. they have night-vision :\

[22:16:48] <Nasp> Ban it
[22:17:19] <pandem> protip: go behind a window at night
[22:18:23] <bomb> then it will affect everyone using cryptocurrencies, not Russia
[22:20:10] <pandem> do windows actually block some night vision stuff
[22:20:24] <Nasp> It blocks thermals
[22:21:51] <pandem> in a dark forest it's super crazy
[22:22:10] <pandem> i had night vision goggles and a friend was like 1m away and he had no idea where i was

[22:46:24] <DoofusCanadensis> heh
[22:48:12] <bomb> is it just me, or Russia is taking the Ukraine invasion slow?
[22:50:14] <bomb> there is almost no air force, to start with
[22:51:13] <pandem> what should the russian air force do?
[22:51:18] <pandem> ukraine still has some AA
[22:52:32] <Nasp> Also all those tanks and veichles in an urban environment is easy to fuck up
[22:54:20] <blezz> they're trying to do the whole thing without civil casualties
[22:54:52] <blezz> no need to use planes then
[22:56:12] <petererer> I saw a tank driving over a moving car, so... not that trying?
[22:56:43] <bomb> not only air force, but as a comparison, Russian ground forces have been MORE active in Syria and Libya
[22:56:49] <pandem> that was ukrainian...
[22:56:55] <pandem> also not really a tank
[22:58:33] <bomb> more like pro-Russian saboteurs with Ukrainian flag
[22:58:41] <bomb> also, yeah, it's an APC
[22:59:02] <bomb> pandem is correct for the first time in 2022.
[22:59:53] <pandem> it looked more like some AA thing or something
[23:00:37] <pandem> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K35_Strela-10 maybe this
[23:00:45] <DoofusCanadensis> still, ran over a car and fellow citizens needed to extract the driver from the vehicle
[23:01:46] <bomb> https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/t13swd/different_angle_of_the_tank_crushing_the_car_in/
[23:01:47] <bomb> hmm yeah
[23:02:20] <bomb> seen @ 1.30
[23:03:51] <pandem> idk, i should probably know more about tanks than 90% of people but it feels like everyone else is a tank expert now
[23:05:10] <DoofusCanadensis> it's the current focus
[23:05:21] <bomb> tanks are those green cars with funny wheels, and exhaust in the front?
[23:07:13] <pandem> tanks are the ones with big ass turrets
[23:08:20] <bomb> weren't turrets birds? anyway I'll google it up
[23:09:47] <bomb> so how's your new life in Baghdad pandem do you enjoy the nightlife?

[23:11:04] <pandem> does this look like baghdad?
[23:11:07] <pandem> just took it from the balcony
[23:13:59] <bomb> the picture is taken hours ago
[23:14:41] <pandem> 1.5h seems like
[23:16:27] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Apparently now half of the amassed forces outside of Ukraine are invading?
[23:16:45] <bomb> so you're in Portugal
[23:16:46] <MatthiasVance> I would also have expected more air to ground combat from RU
[23:16:58] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Given the amount of jets they have, right?
[23:16:59] <bomb> MatthiasVance oh
[23:17:26] <pandem> bomb: does that look like portugal?
[23:17:38] <MatthiasVance> But everyone can fire a Stinger I guess.. so 1000 of those and gone are the jets xD
[23:18:04] <pandem> yeah, russia still have a lot of troops on their side but their logistics can be difficult
[23:18:05] <bomb> MatthiasVance maybe Putin is trying to accomplish it as cheaper as possible? I don't know
[23:19:14] <pandem> my guess is logistics
[23:19:30] <pandem> also if you have 200k troops like at least 50k of those will not be fighting but supporting
[23:19:45] <MatthiasVance> Also you can't send your entire army
[23:19:52] <MatthiasVance> That would be kind of dumb
[23:20:13] <MatthiasVance> Or maybe you can in this case .. who's going to take RU
[23:20:28] <pandem> nah, they have plenty of troops left
[23:21:35] <MatthiasVance> Yeah right now
[23:21:43] <MatthiasVance> I meant in case you wanted it to go quicker
[23:21:53] <MatthiasVance> You'd have to mobilize everything which takes time
[23:22:16] <bomb> Belarus will send troops tonight
[23:22:52] <MatthiasVance> To help or what?
[23:23:02] <MatthiasVance> The russian troops came from belarus did they not
[23:23:07] <MatthiasVance> *also came from
[23:23:40] <irwiss> man, all chat channels turned into propaganda 24/7
[23:24:02] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Propaganda?
[23:25:46] <xb0o2> irwiss: join #linux, it's the usual clusterfuck
[23:26:01] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Care to explain yourself?
[23:26:13] <MatthiasVance> Sounds a bit weird to talk about propaganda.. xD
[23:26:23] <irwiss> xb0o2: lol i'm sure of that :D
[23:26:23] <MatthiasVance> My emoji game is off today
[23:26:43] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: 90% messages are reposts of random fud off the internet about ukraine conflict
[23:27:06] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: This war is on people's minds if that's what you mean
[23:28:01] <bomb> MatthiasVance Belarus is Russia's puppet
[23:28:11] <MatthiasVance> How is quoting reputable news sources FUD irwiss ?
[23:28:12] <bomb> they're coming to attack Ukraine
[23:28:22] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Yeah that's what I thought indeed
[23:28:31] <irwiss> i'm not sure reddit can be called reputable even with a huge allowance :P
[23:28:43] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Oh totally agree
[23:28:56] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: I didn't see anyone quoting reddit here as "truth" though :P
[23:29:27] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: You might also not have meant this channel exclusively, I felt a bit like "heh can't they understand it's on everyones mind right now and people want to talk about it?"
[23:29:48] <irwiss> no, not this channel
[23:29:57] <irwiss> i mean, this channel too, but i mean, channelS in general
[23:32:52] <xb0o2> FWIW you're not the only one feeling that way, irwiss
[23:34:06] <MatthiasVance> Can definitely understand the feeling of "let me decide when and what I want to absorb"
