[00:47:03] <ThePendulum> wow the FIFA games are changing their name to EA Sports Football Club
[00:47:28] <rawktucc> maybe they couldnt get the license?
[00:47:33] <rawktucc> the only good fifa was fifa 99
[00:47:38] <ThePendulum> they could but it wasn't worth the money anymore
[00:47:55] <ThePendulum> I never really played FIFA on pc or console but I still play FIFA 14 on my phone almost daily
[00:48:03] <ThePendulum> I had This Is Football 2002 on my PS2
[00:48:08] <rawktucc> I had backyard soccer
[00:48:23] <ThePendulum> FIFA 14 is the last one that supported kick off mode, and I don't care for career mode /at all/
[00:48:35] <ThePendulum> I just want to pick two international teams, my players, and play

[00:58:38] <skye0> ThePendulum maybe related to a licensing deal? EA recently lost their exclusive license to produce Star Wars games since BFII, and there's no new major Star Wars game yet (nothing new for Star Wars yet). Maybe FIFA decided they didn't want to be associated with EA or something
[00:58:55] <rawktucc> oh thank god EA lost the star wars license
[00:59:09] <skye0> Otherwise can't say as someone with little interest in football
[00:59:53] <skye0> Only games I want to play these days sadly are mostly by big publishers
[01:00:25] <skye0> There's battle royale shooters, Call of Duty and tactical shooters aside from Halo Infinite, that's it
[01:00:37] <skye0> And nothing to scratch my Sims 4 itch
[01:01:20] <ThePendulum> skye0: to my understanding EA wants 1.2 billion to renew the license and it's not worth it for EA. they paid 600 million last time
[01:01:23] <skye0> I even tried expanding to other games but Fallen Order is the only one I've made some effort to play that isn't either a shooter, racer or Sims recently
[01:01:41] <skye0> I could program but it's gonna be stressful
[01:01:49] <ThePendulum> dutch tv channels have been posting summaries on youtube lately so I've gotten more interested in football
[01:02:00] <ThePendulum> 10 minute highlight reels are much more watchable than the full 90 minutes
[01:02:01] <rawktucc> ok so I've tried 3 separate copy processes for rclone, on 3 separate drives, and i'm not getting near gigabit upload speeds. so something is missing here
[01:02:10] <rawktucc> and it's not a RAM or CPU bottleneck
[01:02:13] <rawktucc> :(
[01:02:24] <ThePendulum> what are you getting?
[01:02:30] <rawktucc> 70MB/s in general
[01:02:34] <rawktucc> but more like 65-75MB/s
[01:02:39] <rawktucc> across 2 processes
[01:02:49] <ThePendulum> hm so about half of what it should be?
[01:02:54] <rawktucc> like 3/4th
[01:03:03] <rawktucc> missing about 20MB/s
[01:03:24] <rawktucc> or more like 30-40
[01:03:50] <ThePendulum> are others saying rclone should be getting close to the network limits? 
[01:03:58] <rawktucc> not sure
[01:04:16] <rawktucc> i can hear the HDDs kinda thrashing a bit but idk
[01:11:37] <skye0> With `rsync --ignore-existing`, do you guys get issues with files not updating? Had to use that command as without it, file transfers would take too long and waste space
[01:18:47] <rawktucc> well... it will ignore existing files
[01:18:56] <rawktucc> so it completely ignores any changes on existing files
[01:19:08] <rawktucc> if you need to update times, you can just use --times
[01:19:12] <rawktucc> or set permissions
[01:19:45] <rawktucc> if you have an issue where files you don't want updating are getting updated, you should run a copy with -v and log output, and review the log to see why it copied the file again
[01:20:03] <rawktucc> i had a few files get overwritten multiple times because there were duplicates of the same file, but just different in some other way
[01:22:05] <skye0> OK, good to know
[01:23:30] <skye0> also, random question
[01:23:48] <skye0> How family friendly do you think the UK is?
[01:24:12] <ThePendulum> family friendly in what sense?
[01:24:30] <ThePendulum> probably varies a lot from town to town
[01:32:37] <skye0> adult communities and establishments and the like
[01:33:04] <skye0> was just wondering because i'm kind of yearning for an adult community i could be more into where i could discuss more mature topics, lacking that sort of space right now
[01:35:17] <skye0> there's probably one but idk how to feel about it. might prefer online ones for the time being since i still live with parents
[01:36:09] <ThePendulum> hm haven't really seen many communities that aren't centered around a hobby like a book or sports club, but then again I don't live in the city
[01:36:15] <ThePendulum> nor in the UK
[01:36:31] <ThePendulum> at least not with regular meetups, just online communities that may get together as a yearly one-off
[01:36:47] <skye0> there's probably one or two queer communities but they tend more towards activism sort of stuff
[01:37:00] <skye0> not sure if i am willing to explore discord or IRC communities
