[01:08:12] <headius> ok, I have a bit more time today to look at the other targeted issues

[01:10:53] <headius> https://github.com/actions/setup-java/issues/278
[01:10:59] <headius> that is causing some jobs to fail on our end, not our fault
[01:11:48] <headius> the ones that ran cover all suites and seem fine so I'm merging
[01:12:31] <headius> enebo: hah because Travis gave us some juice the 9.2 branch has CI again: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/runs/4821727422
[01:12:53] <headius> we should just punt on moving 9.2 to GHA since this is working again
[01:33:54] <headius> enebo: I punted the remaining 2.6 thing to 9.3.4 and detargeted that date week parsing draft PR that has been idle since 2020
[01:34:11] <headius> also merged in the two working jobs on M1 but I will keep the branch around for ongoing improvements
