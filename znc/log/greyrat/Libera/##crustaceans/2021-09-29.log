[00:54:07] <dimadima> "still" - are you say that's an old fashioned thing?
[00:54:19] <manicennui> Yeah, it was pretty common when I was growing up.
[00:54:30] <manicennui> I think some publications' style guides still recommend it.
[00:54:56] <manicennui> And Utah doesn't get abbreviated apparently.

[00:56:16] <dimadima> ?

[00:58:05] <dimadima> i was only ever aware of that second column, "postal" and the other style was very much a mystery
[00:58:07] <manicennui> Pennsylvania only gets two characters?

[00:59:31] <manicennui> Complete chaos.
[01:00:18] <dimadima> well, by the time i was in first or second grade in the early 90s we were not taught that first column
[01:00:31] <dimadima> i always thought it was ad-hoc
[01:00:49] <dimadima> and i guess i never noticed any consistency because as you say, there isn't any
[01:01:22] <manicennui> I think there are some kind of rules.
[01:01:40] <dimadima> probably each state's secretary of state decides and their legislature ratifies it
[01:01:41] <manicennui> I think it gets four letters, unless the fourth letter is a vowel.
[01:01:48] <manicennui> I can't explain Pennsylvania though.

[05:45:01] <dimadima> gwozniak: any particular reason you're looking at it? broad topics in computing like that, i'm often not quite sure what to make of them
[05:45:23] <dimadima> just a sort of historiograhical interest?
[05:46:45] <gwozniak> It's part of my research into writing the review for Hanson & Sussman's latest book
[05:47:02] <dimadima> oh yeah you mentioned that. cool!
[05:47:13] <gwozniak> They talk about the evolution of software in their book, but they are pretty loose about the whole thing
[05:47:48] <dimadima> they probably mean agile
[05:47:56] <dimadima> :)
[05:48:46] <gwozniak> I suspect it's just an analogy they use
[05:49:20] <gwozniak> They take a very biological-centered view of software development, and I want to see what others have to say
[06:02:40] <dimadima> literally biological or something like "holistic"
[06:03:05] <companion_cube> I use homeopathic tests, personally
[06:03:11] <companion_cube> very, very diluted
[06:03:11] <hoistbypetard> it tickles me that gerikson 's gemini space doesn't render well on lagrange :P
[06:03:18] <hoistbypetard> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/PTAL9jkj/image.png
[06:03:29] <companion_cube> yikes
[06:04:33] <companion_cube> is that supposed to be an image? or some unicode art?
[06:05:05] <hoistbypetard> unicode art
[06:05:08] <dimadima> gemini doesn't do inline links for bold italic but it does stuff like that?
[06:05:18] <dimadima> s/for/or
[06:05:22] <hoistbypetard> in the bowels of lagrange settings, there's an option for monospace body
[06:05:47] <hoistbypetard> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ILgRvXLt/image.png
[06:05:53] <hoistbypetard> that fixes it
[06:05:57] <dimadima> ah yeah gerikson uses amfora
[06:06:17] <dimadima> i would already have amfora if it was in brew
[06:06:37] <dimadima> hmm the README says it is. maybe i need to update
[06:07:51] <hoistbypetard> i don't use gemini very much, but the default typography in lagrange (which mangled the unicode art) makes for quite a nice reading experience whenever i notice something that's also published to gemini
[06:08:35] <dimadima> yeah that's a good consideration...
[06:08:53] <dimadima> and there's no <pre> so everything is one font
[06:09:04] <dimadima> i kind of like how there's no inline links
[06:09:24] <dimadima> i guess inline links are what blew up the web
[06:09:35] <dimadima> before images really got it going
[06:09:49] <gwozniak> Inline links are what make the web great
[06:10:03] <hoistbypetard> yes
[06:10:04] <dimadima> i just wish there was some more formal specification there
[06:10:19] <dimadima> i'm guessing others do not wish there
[06:10:21] <dimadima> that*
[06:11:05] <dimadima> gwozniak: hoistbypetard: you both like how www linking is
[06:11:51] <dimadima> as in: inline; could encode any other element pretty much; free form
[06:11:56] <hoistbypetard> i think that is the exact thing that made the web more useful than gopher and the other "WAIS" things we played with in the early 90s
[06:12:17] <dimadima> why more useful?
[06:12:24] <dimadima> if you can articulate
[06:13:05] <hoistbypetard> the ease of connecting different works together felt new and powerful. deep links, in particular, were a great new thing
[06:13:53] <hoistbypetard> i went from explaining to someone how to go to prodigy, visit area A, then click button B, and scroll about halfway down...
[06:14:05] <hoistbypetard> to being able to link directly to the thing i was referencing
[06:15:01] <dimadima> that's definitely useful
[06:15:13] <dimadima> do you know if gemini does deep links? gopher did not?
[06:16:21] <hoistbypetard> gopher didn't really do links. i think gemini sort of does but separates them from the text and people use numbers in brackets to work around it
[06:17:52] <hoistbypetard> i think i'm weird in that gemini inspires no strong feelings for me whatsoever
[06:18:15] <dimadima> overall i like links, but they've always, to this day after all these years, been a distraction i've had to learn how to manage
[06:18:44] <dimadima> which for me puts a big dent in their value
[06:18:56] <hoistbypetard> i can see what you mean. tvtropes.com is the canonical illustration of that
[06:19:01] <dimadima> but yeah i'm trying to imagine a wikipedia without inline links and it seems impossible
[06:19:05] <dimadima> how would you even do it
[06:19:28] <hoistbypetard> you'd have to push a lot of smarts to the client
[06:20:11] <dimadima> in what sense?
[06:20:34] <dimadima> or what do you mean?
[06:21:05] <hoistbypetard> the client would need to index the pages itself and link related terms in order to have anything much resembling wikipedia without inline links being sent down by the server
[06:21:21] <hoistbypetard> pre-web, you saw some attempts at that with FTP and Archie servers
[06:22:00] <hoistbypetard> archie did the indexing and archie-aware FTP clients could navigate FTP in ways not entire dissimilar to the web
[06:22:37] <dimadima> so the result would be like an auto-linked wikipedia
[06:23:00] <dimadima> where it somehow attempts to identify which spans of text might be linked to which other articles?
[06:23:14] <dimadima> which would defeat the purpose of not using http/html?
[06:23:23] <hoistbypetard> pretty much :)
[06:23:41] <hoistbypetard> and defeat the "easy enough to write a client in a weekend" thing too

[06:23:50] <dimadima> definitely...
[06:24:17] <dimadima> i'm sure the gemini people have had these conversations exhaustively
[06:24:30] <dimadima> "so imagine a wikipedia article w/o inline links, would that be cool?"
[06:24:37] <dimadima> "yeah the links would be at the end or something"
[06:25:44] <dimadima> heh i'd never heard of archie
[06:25:49] <dimadima> or maybe i did and forgot
[06:26:00] <dimadima> i wasn't online until 1995 or maybe early 1996
[06:26:08] <hoistbypetard> i think i find these more distracting than inline links
[06:26:10] <hoistbypetard> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/HGJmeVpr/image.png
[06:26:32] <dimadima> that's for sure
[06:26:36] <hoistbypetard> archie had a really brief window of popularity
[06:27:23] <dimadima> well maybe i'm not so sure
[06:27:58] <dimadima> but i do think for sure that the links inline like that isn't good
[06:29:20] <dimadima> there was a thread on HN around the time firefox fired all those people and i left a rambling comment about how i think the solution to google rendering engine/web standards hegemony is a simpler set of of standards that are easier to implement and a bunch of people were like "check out gemini"
[06:29:47] <dimadima> this was probably january 2020?
[06:29:53] <dimadima> but this isn't it
[06:30:16] <dimadima> no inline image or bold/italic?
[06:30:18] <dimadima> i mean inline links
[06:30:43] <dimadima> or images for that matter, i'm guessing
[06:32:36] <dimadima> i guess inline links have more pros than cons
[06:32:59] <dimadima> and then if you want there are reader views that hide the links
[06:33:02] <dimadima> bada-bing, no links
[06:39:53] <hoistbypetard> i use reader view a lot. funny enough, when everyone started adding it, i didn't think it was all that interesting.
[06:47:05] <dimadima> i was drawn to reader mode right away cause of my aforementioned distraction issue but funny enough i hardly actually use it
[06:47:24] <gwozniak> I also use reader mode a lot
[06:48:28] <dimadima> gwozniak: so you consciously remember  you want to use it? or something triggers it in your mind?

[12:25:34] <Brekkjern> Such pearl clutching
[12:28:18] <Brekkjern> Man, I fucking hate the UX for reading mailing lists...
[12:32:02] <gerikson> oh god yes
[12:33:16] <riv> yeah it is pretty bad
[12:33:28] <riv> although at least you can find everything
[12:33:49] <riv> these modern things with infinite scrolling are pretty bad UX on the other end of the spectrum

[12:37:23] <gerikson> having an archive per year is dumb
[12:37:30] <gerikson> at least split up by months ffs
[12:38:11] <riv> the biggest problem is that theyre talking about gemini
[12:45:52] <phil> What is gemini anyway?
[12:46:09] <phil> If I google, all I get is a weird cryptocurrency thing & bad astrology.
[12:46:44] <riv> it's gopher with TLS
[12:47:49] <phil> So the web, but with txt pages?
[12:47:52] <riv> yeah
[12:48:24] <phil> Great. A bunch of people trying to cosplay the 1990s internet.
[12:48:34] <riv> ... exactly XD
[12:48:40] <phil> I mean, there were some good things about being online then, but gopher was not really one of them.
[12:51:09] <phil> Or, to put it another way, I think I agree with gerickson here.
[12:53:23] <phil> The Web was/is best when it was/is a reflection of Tim Berners Lee‚Äôs vision. Gopher is not that.
[12:54:26] <phil> The web as application platform built on a tottering heap of protocols that happened to be implemented in browsers in order to deliver a better web experience & were therefore available everywhere is what‚Äôs bad about the modern web.
[12:55:45] <phil> But also good, because it is (mostly) still available everywhere. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs also controlled by one company who sees implementing an ever more complex application platform as a good way to create a moat & prevent anyone else having any control over the platform, including their own users.
[12:56:07] <phil> In conclusion, the web is a land of contrasts.
[12:56:57] <riv> I feel like it's become harder to get the precise information you want from searching the web now
[13:01:07] <gerikson> someone else mentioned that
[13:15:14] <Brekkjern> riv: You could have structured the mailing lists somewhat like the comment threads of Lobste.rs without having infinite scrolling. At least you would be able to read all the comments without losing context on where you are in the tree...
[13:18:45] <phil>  riv: Oh, definitely. SEO has utterly poisoned Google results on almost every topic.
[13:19:34] <phil> Without an intimate understanding of how SEO works, it‚Äôs hard to impossible to find those gems of detailed information on a topic that used to naturally bubble up to the top.
[13:20:39] <phil> Which is presumably why Google pours money into anything that can protect their monopoly, because they know their search results are shit these days.
[13:23:54] <bontaq> but do they?  stuff like searching for "the weather" or "$football team score" have good results and that far outways any weirdo searching for, like, 1920s fountain pen reviews
[13:27:15] <phil> Sure, I think Google would say that they give good results for the majority of searches, but that‚Äôs precisely because they‚Äôve captured web traffic that used to be perfectly well served elsewhere. On net, we‚Äôre all worse off but Google has made bank, so...

[13:29:54] <edm> what's wrong with 1920 fountain pens
[13:30:00] <bontaq> I agree, just not sure they even know their results are bad.  I'm sure their internal figures are like "wow we're crushing it so hard"
[13:30:17] <edm> But it is very very annoying
[13:32:06] <edm> e.g. in my academic field there might be someone working in the 1970s at Nasa called, say, Taylor Swaft, and god help you if you try and google 'Taylor Swaft detatching flow' or something because google says 'HAHA YOU MEAN TAYLOR SWIFT SHAKE IT OFF'

[13:33:12] <phil> bontaq: I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre right.
[13:33:17] <phil> edm: I feel your pain.
[13:33:19] <edm> there's a sort of bayesian gravity well or event horizon and if you search term is within google's large radius of event horizon around a more popular topic, you're just going to get sucked in. there's no escape
[13:33:30] <phil> Welcome to search by DNN.
[13:33:57] <phil> Oh, you look like you probably fit into /this/ search group. Let me shove you in there whether you like it or not.
[13:34:24] <phil> On average, they‚Äôre probably right. But the lack of any kind of escape hatch is infuriating.
[13:35:44] <edm> in the same way that people who thin 1+1 = 1 and people who thin 1+1 = 3 are also right, on average
[13:36:49] <edm> s/thin/think
[13:37:04] <edm> i'd go for old goog in a heartbeat for search
[13:37:25] <edm> they can keep the clever stuff for 'chinese restaurants near me' or routing around london traffic or whatever
[13:41:09] <phil> As nerds, we just have to accept that the old, good Google is long gone.
[13:42:15] <phil> In other news, I think I‚Äôm finally almost over the horrible cold. Might actually be able to get some useful work done.
[13:43:19] <phil> Which after the last week or so, will be a welcome change. Nothing more boring than being ill enough to not be able to work, but not actually ill ill.

[15:54:01] <gerikson> truly we live in an age of miracles
[15:55:00] <riv> by using a reasonable algorithm?
[15:56:44] <gerikson> probably used Rust
[16:04:46] <gerikson> ``when inserting a single bracket at the beginning of the checker.ts file of the TypeScript project, which has more than 42k lines of code, it takes about 10 seconds until the colors of all bracket pairs update. During these 10 seconds of processing, the extension host process burns at 100% CPU and all features that are powered by extensions, such as auto-completion or diagnostics, stop
[16:04:46] <gwozniak> gerikson: and I bet if I used this new algorithm I wouldn't even notice

[16:05:48] <gerikson> gwozniak: need more TypeScript, obviously
[16:05:55] <gwozniak> So, "the original was a complete piece of shit and we implemented something basic that any self-respecting programmer would do"
[16:06:54] <gwozniak> Should I bother reading Drew's response, or is he just hugging the Gemini flag?

[16:36:26] <kline> i like gemini
[16:36:44] <kline> the main mistake we made on the web was giving the developers too much power to do stupid shit
[16:36:44] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[16:37:10] <prussian> but that isn't 4 words.
[16:37:22] <companion_cube> there's a middle ground though
[16:37:31] <kline> gemini takes away all the footguns and the result is that stuff is generally more consistent and, i guess, easier to handle from an accessibility viewpoint
[16:38:18] <kline> for anyone curious about why devault cares about accessibility, its worth noting his vision is rapidly degrading and he's probably not going to be able to read code with his eyes far before the end of his natural productive years
[16:38:37] <companion_cube> hu, didn't know that
[16:38:45] <companion_cube> are you friend with him kline?
[16:38:50] <kline> so he seems to have a choice of advocating for accessibility now or be doomed to leave his passion by 40 or someting
[16:39:03] <kline> companion_cube, hes posted about it before im sure
[16:39:44] <companion_cube> it's a bit unfortunate for his passion for wayland
[16:40:01] <kline> dunno
[16:40:19] <kline> he's a very productive (if opinionated) programmer and will remain so for probably a decade or something, ask him
[16:40:38] <kline> he's possibly going to be the person who gets wayland accessibility into good shape
[16:41:08] <companion_cube> well good luck to him
[16:41:16] <companion_cube> he is very productive indeed

[16:42:12] <kline> gerikson, i dont know, i think its focus related given he wears glasses
[16:42:23] <prussian> riv: lol
[16:42:24] <prussian> this
[16:42:52] <gerikson> and I'm all for accessibility, but I do think that we're gonna get more "leverage" by ensuring that HTML/CSS is amenable to non-sighted users
[16:42:59] <gerikson> like semantic markup etc
[16:43:25] <kline> i think html is too far gone to turn back now, but im not against it
[16:43:49] <kline> js and css abominations are a million steps back for every semantic/accessible markup step forward
[16:44:10] <ngoldbaum> are there actual blind users of gemini? seems like most users are tech nerds from my outsider perspective
[16:44:12] <gerikson> ``The medium I'm using now is constrained, too - I can't add inline images or links on Hacker News, but we all seem to have found productive uses for this site nonetheless.''
[16:44:24] <companion_cube> ah yes, the productive markup of HN
[16:44:30] <companion_cube> where people struggle to post the most basic code snippets
[16:44:36] <gerikson> kline: yes, unfortunately
[16:44:40] <ngoldbaum> appealing to accessibility doesn‚Äôt matter if the reality is that blind people prefer the actual web that normal people use
[16:45:27] <companion_cube> or if the content is on the web
[16:45:56] <kline> ngoldbaum, i mean, thats like pointing out that most blind people prefer cities to towns, simply because most of the population is concentrated in cities. its true that most blind people remain using the web for now, but that doesnt mean that gemini etc arent more amenable to accessibilisation and will overtake this when the tools build on it
[16:46:49] * ngoldbaum waits for that
[16:46:59] <prussian> that
[16:47:02] <prussian> there
[16:48:07] <kline> ngoldbaum, i dont have anything against that, and in all probability gemini will never sweep the accessibility "market"
[16:48:24] <prussian> Let's just be real. HTML5 happened because everyone wants a VM to run arbitrary code on people's computers without trying to rediscover all the fun ways to sandbox escape for the 100th time.
[16:48:25] <kline> but lots of things that were technically better have lost in the market
[16:48:52] <prussian> Gemini just has no use case that asking a server to blast generic crap at you with http doesn't solve.
[16:49:26] <prussian> we'll just reach out to grab each other in the middle somehow and gemini will just reinvent the same shit. at least that's my guess.
[16:49:53] <gerikson> kline: I might get more involved in the Gemini mailing list but to be honest the drama around favicon.txt turned me off
[16:50:22] <kline> never read it
[16:50:28] <companion_cube> at least ddevault has this netsurf wrapper project I think
[16:50:30] <kline> i used the irc channel a bit more
[16:50:33] <companion_cube> which is a lot more promising than gemini
[16:50:35] <kline> companion_cube, yeah, visurf
[16:50:41] <companion_cube> yeah that's kind of cool
[16:50:47] <companion_cube> might be his first project I'd use
[16:50:49] <kline> though i dont think this is the first time he's tried his hand at it
[16:51:30] <kline> i dont think ddv is any better at spotting "winner" projects, but he's productive enough to get a lot of projects to MVP quickly, and throw away the ones that dont work
[16:51:36] <kline> the google of developers
[16:51:46] <kline> so dont get attached to visurf
[16:51:59] <companion_cube> :D
[16:52:02] <gerikson> haha
[16:52:22] <gerikson> man I can't believe people are fighting in the TZinfo mailing list
[16:57:20] <dimadima> what's the beef over there
[16:58:02] <dimadima> yeah gerikson i was eating a pear in the kitchen last night when the word gemini caught my eye on hn and lo and behold it was your post
[16:58:06] <ngoldbaum> i think appealing to accessibility doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt push to also include blind users and make sure you‚Äôre actually solving problems they have and are making something useful for them, otherwise it‚Äôs just a clever argument to beat over the head of people like gustaf
[16:58:22] <gerikson> dimadima: the maintainer has reorganized it a bit so there's no single entry for say Oslo, instead "Oslo" is a link to Berlin
[16:58:36] <gerikson> but it's only if you query data from before 1970
[16:59:07] <gerikson> dimadima: blame cb

[16:59:22] <dimadima> what does cb have to do with it? the original post to lobsters?

[19:17:42] <prussian> I don't think it's as simple as described.
[19:17:54] <prussian> gemtext will only get more and more gross, I'm sure.
[19:18:34] <prussian> as your article rightfully says, newlines are to be taken literally so you have to write paragraphs as giant lines and assume wrapping happens
[19:19:09] <prussian> that alone is just showing the real cold hard limits of the format. and then that little nagging demon behind you is prodding you, showing you that html/css have already solved many of these layout concerns.

[19:20:47] <riv> but its not a technical reason so it's invalid
[19:21:35] <companion_cube> isn't the reason it's better than gopher, that it has TLS?
[19:21:44] <kline> not really
[19:21:53] <kline> geminis tls system is pretty poor
[19:22:00] <kline> even though i like gemini its the weakest bit
[19:22:58] <prussian> not hugely familiar with it overall. hopefully they didn't reinvent all of the mistakes of http though, in terms of the actual protocol
[19:23:15] <riv> you can do TLS with gopher if you want (but dont) or run gophers on .onion domains
[19:23:20] <kline> well, its trust on first use, which isnt a terrible thing
[19:23:31] <kline> but the trust is on the whole cert fingerprint - not the key fp
[19:23:43] <prussian> I loke TOFU for me, but I know a ton of people who just blindly hit "accept"
[19:23:50] <kline> so when the cert expires it needs to be re-trusted, even if its with the same key
[19:24:09] <prussian> like, I will hover over people setting up ssh git and they see "blah blah key for bitbucket.org" and will type yes without even thinking
[19:24:37] <prussian> and here I am, typing into google, "what is bitbucket's ssh key fingerprint"
[19:24:51] <kline> so i spend a lot of time just removing the previous trust and re-trusting sites that have good lets encrypt certs that i want to trust by key
[19:25:19] <prussian> that's funny
[19:29:05] <prussian> well. ok. basic research, at least the gemini protocol looks very simple
[19:29:16] <prussian> hard to muck up, i'd think.
[19:29:39] <prussian> can you do like SNI for loadbalancing?
[19:30:20] <prussian> i guess so.
[19:30:31] <prussian> cute. I guess I'll run one for the hell of it.
[19:43:52] <Brekkjern> How douchy would it be to create some sort of bot that would connect to Drews gemini server and request random posts, and access the favicon.txt file? And just randomize IPs so blocking it wouldn't help?
[19:44:59] <edm> 7/10
[19:45:26] <Brekkjern> Hmm. Not bad...
[19:45:31] <edm> i mean 9.8/10 by my standards but the internet is a big place

[19:58:03] <Brekkjern> I agree. It is hilarious that he has such a strong reaction to it
[19:58:16] <companion_cube> > Seriously, who put Drew in charge?
[19:58:19] <companion_cube> amazing
[19:58:20] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[19:58:38] <dimadima> if this is the driving force behind gemini, i'd have to guess that gemini is dead in the water
[19:58:43] <indigo> Drew is always in charge, you just don't know it yet
[19:58:59] <Brekkjern> Of course gemini is dead in the water. That's the entire point.
[19:59:19] <indigo> We just have to wait for netcraft to confirm
[19:59:25] <Brekkjern> gerikson: Do you have some traffic logs for your post on gemini?
[19:59:36] <Brekkjern> On gemini that is. Not http
[20:00:56] <gerikson> Brekkjern: I'm sure I have...
[20:00:58] <indigo> I visited his post on Gemini (using a proxy)
[20:01:03] <dimadima> companion_cube: i misssed that. lol
[20:01:14] <indigo> Those damn line breaks
[20:01:17] * indigo shakes fist
[20:01:20] <dimadima> "Every gemini page shall "
[20:01:32] <dimadima> skips "should" and goes straigh to "shall"
[20:01:47] <companion_cube> maybe there should be a competition of what gemini extensions would trigger ddevault the most
[20:01:55] <companion_cube> "hey I added js support to gemini"
[20:02:30] <Brekkjern> The idea of doing the favicon thing is that it isn't clientside, so he's just gonna have to deal with it
[20:02:56] <dimadima> lol companion_cube
[20:03:31] <gerikson> Brekkjern: 240 lines in journalctl ;)
[20:04:34] <manicennui> Sweet. Just received a call from a new electricity disconnection scam.
[20:05:00] <dimadima> am i missing something? is ddevault the BDLF of gemini or just a total asshole?
[20:05:02] <Brekkjern> gerikson: Hmm. So way less than 1% of the connections, and as long as I space out the connections at around 1 connection an hour on average around the clock...
[20:05:20] <dimadima> you don't  get to write stuff like "do. not. extend. gemini. period" unless you're BDFL and even then, you *still* dont take that tone with people

[22:11:53] <manicennui> heh
[22:13:56] <dimadima> excellent
[22:15:54] <manicennui> There isn't a whole lot around the stadium, and they only play 16 games or whatever.
[22:16:16] <manicennui> Not sure how much the city makes from ticket sales and such.
[22:17:07] <manicennui> We've spent a fuckton of money on the stadium.
[22:17:22] <manicennui> I assume like most things, we pay for it and the team/owner make most of the profit.
[22:17:31] <dimadima> yeah that's sports
[22:18:08] <manicennui> It would make more sense for the Cubs though.
[22:18:14] <manicennui> I don't think we pay for their shit though.
[22:18:22] <manicennui> That area has tons of stuff and is packed on game days.
[22:18:27] <manicennui> And they play a lot of games.
[22:19:46] <manicennui> This is the area around Soldier Field: https://goo.gl/maps/1pWPWaJT8SYNfDeT8
[22:19:46] <buttsbot> Google Maps
[22:21:04] <manicennui> There is nothing in the area.
[22:21:21] <manicennui> Any money spent is probably at the stadium itself, and I don't know how much of that the city sees.
[22:21:25] <manicennui> Can't find any numbers.
[22:22:51] <manicennui> Arlington Heights doesn't have enough money to build a stadium with taxpayer money. I hope the state doesn't end up paying for it or some nonsense.
[22:24:17] <dimadima> hopefully the soccer team will make good use of it if the bears leave
[22:25:09] <manicennui> And concerts.
[22:27:11] <dimadima> grant part is sort of the better setting for concerts around there no?
[22:27:12] <manicennui> Maybe we can knock it down and build more luxury rentals!
[22:27:27] <dimadima> or just convert it to luxury rentals
[22:28:35] <manicennui> Grant Park is used more for festivals
[22:28:50] <manicennui> United Center seems to be the place for bands that want to play an arena.
[22:29:09] <manicennui> I don't like concerts in venues like that.
[22:29:28] <dimadima> me neither
[22:29:51] <dimadima> good if you want to hear echos distortion and reverb
[22:29:51] <manicennui> Two of the more popular venues are also like 10 minutes from me.
[22:30:04] <manicennui> I want to see the band generally.
[22:30:14] <manicennui> And not from a mile away.
[22:30:30] <dimadima> which ones
[22:30:31] <manicennui> So there are a limited number of seats in arenas that I'd consider worthwhile, and they are going to cost a fortune.
[22:30:45] <manicennui> dimadima: The Riv and Aragon Ballroom.
[22:30:50] <dimadima> i hardly ever went/go to show
[22:30:56] <dimadima> oh i want to the aragon ballroom once or twice
[22:30:59] <dimadima> once i bet
[22:31:10] <manicennui> I went to dozens of shows over a few years about a decade ago.
[22:31:17] <manicennui> As well has multiple festivals.
[22:32:37] <manicennui> Since then I go to maybe a couple shows per year, other than during the pandemic.
[22:32:49] <manicennui> I prefer Chicago Theater.
[22:33:43] <manicennui> You can sit pretty far back on the main floor and still see well, and tickets are generally not crazy.
[22:33:45] <dimadima> i could never get into shows
[22:33:57] <manicennui> You have to go to really great ones.
[22:34:04] <manicennui> And I don't like standing room only shows.
[22:34:07] <dimadima> yeah i've only enjoyed a few, almost all metal
[22:34:08] <manicennui> Chicago Theater is seated.
[22:34:25] <dimadima> i think my favorite venue in chicago was reggie's
[22:34:31] <dimadima> lots of metal shows there back when i was there
[22:34:33] <manicennui> Is that a bar?
[22:35:06] <dimadima> it's more of a venue
[22:35:17] <dimadima> google says: "No-frills venue for hearing up-and-coming acts plus a wide pub grub menu & loads of beers."
[22:35:20] <manicennui> I've seen several shows at the various bars that have a small area with a stage.
[22:35:53] <dimadima> yeah all my favorite shows have been in bars or smaller venue with bands i didnt know and have mostly since forgot
[22:36:00] <dimadima> proper show shows i almost never enjoy
[22:36:27] <dimadima> one time i saw Sting at lincon center in new york and that was pretty sweet
[22:36:34] <dimadima> and i didn't even know i liked sting
[22:36:35] <dimadima> lol
[22:36:44] <dimadima> some people just know how to put on a show
[22:37:03] <dimadima> (lincoln center, in new york)
[22:37:34] <dimadima> most shows though i'm jus bored out of my mind and want to go do something else
[22:38:55] <manicennui> Because you aren't into the music?
[22:39:38] <dimadima> naa i love music. just don't like being at shows for some reason. really loud, sound is often really bad
[22:39:47] <manicennui> Yeah, I get that.
[22:39:59] <dimadima> i think that's why metal works for me for shows
[22:40:01] <manicennui> I kind of know which venues have bad audio, and I've learned which bands aren't worth seeing live.
[22:40:31] <manicennui> Surprisingly, outdoor festivals often have great sound.
[22:40:37] <dimadima> i like symphonies and jazz bands and non-amplified music
[22:40:42] <dimadima> live
[22:41:11] <dimadima> interesting, i wouldn't have thought that
[22:41:21] <manicennui> Yeah, I love the CSO, but tickets are pricy.
[22:41:24] <dimadima> in general i wish there was less amplification in this world
[22:41:32] <dimadima> somehow people got by without it
[22:41:42] <manicennui> Can't play larger venues without it.
[22:41:48] <dimadima> now you go to a coffe shop and people are rocking a PA
[22:41:49] <dimadima> like wtf
[22:42:10] <dimadima> well you can't play rock in a large venue without it
[22:42:24] <dimadima> but symphony/opera halls work just fine w/o amplification
[22:42:35] <dimadima> maybe people could figure out how to do that
[22:42:44] <wrl> well yeah they're specifically designed for that
[22:42:45] <dimadima> but ithink ppl just like shit loud loud loud
[22:42:59] <wrl> symphony/opera halls are designed to carry the audio from the stage everywhere else
[22:43:01] <dimadima> yeah and for certain instrucments
[22:43:05] <wrl> though they are usually mic'd up too
[22:43:15] <wrl> y'all gotta be wearing earplugs to shows tho
[22:43:25] <dimadima> yeah i wear earplugs to shows
[22:43:29] <wrl> sound techs always EQ up the highs because human bodies absorb highs
[22:43:31] <dimadima> improves the sound, if anything
[22:43:35] <manicennui> dimadima: You'd probably really hate Dinosaur Jr.
[22:43:41] <manicennui> They purposely try to be obnoxiously loud.
[22:43:48] <wrl> dimadima: yeah 100%
[22:43:48] <manicennui> Way louder than most bands.
[22:43:58] <dimadima> manicennui: i listened a bunch of dinisaur jr in middle school / hs but never saw them live
[22:44:12] <dimadima> i tihnk i dislike most shows in that genre and adjacent genres
[22:44:21] <manicennui> I saw them at Pitchfork one year. It was pretty excessive.
[22:44:43] <dimadima> funny that dinosaur jr would be loud hahaha
[22:44:53] <dimadima> they're not exactly aggro iirc
[22:45:13] <dimadima> but as a first step i'd love if it ppl stopped playing coffee shops with PA
[22:45:16] <dimadima> PAs

[22:56:01] <dimadima> "React started as a nice rendering library. Then it was infected with all sorts of Functional Programming paradigms grafted on top of Javascript."
[22:56:16] <dimadima> like what? functions?
[22:58:38] <companion_cube> that's rich
[22:59:06] <companion_cube> React wasn't functional before, it was just, uh, using immutability and functions ü§î
[22:59:19] <dimadima> ^ lol
[22:59:20] <dimadima> yes
[22:59:45] <manicennui> FP is basically the same as fascism.
[23:00:09] <dimadima> it's forced upon the masses to weaken and enslave them
[23:00:13] <dimadima> first FP, now vaccines
[23:00:39] <manicennui> I don't want more people to die, but the lambda variant is going to be pretty cool.
[23:00:58] <companion_cube> I'm holding out for the Pi variant
[23:01:07] <dimadima> you mean like the functional lambda architecture or covid or
[23:01:12] <dimadima> some fusion of the two
[23:01:27] <manicennui> The lambda variant of the covid virus.
[23:01:35] <dimadima> (that was a bad joke ,sorry)
[23:01:40] <dimadima> why is it going to be cool
[23:02:02] <manicennui> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html
[23:02:03] <buttsbot> SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions
[23:02:03] <manicennui> WTF
[23:02:07] <manicennui> They skipped around.
[23:02:23] <manicennui> dimadima: The name.
[23:03:05] <dimadima> "I haven‚Äôt used React in a while, what does it offer that WebComponents do not?"
[23:03:16] <dimadima> translation: I have never used React but I do want to leave a comment
[23:03:28] <manicennui> Or is this saying that we went through the entire alphabet, but only those variants are being monitored?
[23:03:32] <dimadima> this is like every React thread. GPT-3 is writing this shit
[23:03:33] <manicennui> Is there already a lambda variant?
[23:03:50] <dimadima> yeah i think i heard of a lambda variant
[23:03:59] <manicennui> Apparently there is.
[23:05:23] <dimadima> oh lol i missed your joke's usage of the much more relevant lamda to FP
[23:05:24] <dimadima> my bad
[23:12:55] <manicennui> I'm always amazed by the discussions we have about IT costs that are tens of thousands of dollars per month for a company with over $1 billion in revenue.
[23:18:06] <dimadima> are there lower hanging fruit?
[23:22:42] <indigo> dimadima: I dipped in to React over the weekend (bug in my music server software)... IMO React is decent but Redux is annoying to work with
[23:24:02] <dimadima> indigo: redux was was and is a trick
[23:24:06] <dimadima> was and is*
[23:24:21] <dimadima> it was never really necessary, and especially after react 16.8, it really became unecessary
[23:24:33] <dimadima> redux is truly terrible
[23:24:38] <dimadima> on so many levels
[23:25:01] <indigo> Redux just reminds me of the Win32 API message queue
[23:25:15] <dimadima> sadly i never did win32 programming :(
[23:26:21] <dimadima> if you're going to over-engineer react, i'd go straight for xstate
[23:26:48] <dimadima> https://github.com/statelyai/xstate
[23:26:49] <buttsbot> GitHub - statelyai/xstate: State machines and statecharts for the modern web.
[23:27:04] <dimadima> redux is vaporware
[23:27:50] <dimadima> i don't know how Dan Abramov pull the wool over an entire community like he did
[23:27:59] <dimadima> <end redux rant>
[23:31:04] <dimadima> indigo: but of huge interest to me is this music server software! what is it?
[23:31:14] <dimadima> (guessing it's OSS?)
[23:31:43] <indigo> dimadima: https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome
[23:31:44] <buttsbot> GitHub - navidrome/navidrome: üéß‚òÅÔ∏è Modern Music Server and Streamer compatible with Subsonic/Airsonic
[23:33:42] <dimadima> thank you i really want to set one of these up when i get the chance. are you using a mobile client?
[23:34:17] <dimadima> my dream is a server software that interacts directly with torrents
[23:34:46] <dimadima> that transcodes (possibly live?) and lets you tag while maintaining provenance of the torrent
[23:34:48] <indigo> I'm using both the web client, and a mobile client for iPhone called play:Sub
[23:34:54] <dimadima> thank you
