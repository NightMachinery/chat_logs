[11:32:34] <alloy> how come I get a lot of 404 errors on some mirrors but not others?
[11:32:36] <alloy> hehe
[11:32:51] <thurstylark> in response to what?
[11:33:20] <alloy> I'm just trying to install python-pip but lots of mirrors have failing deps even though they still have the pip package itself - seems odd

[11:34:32] <thurstylark> and if a package was updated very recently, it could be still propagating to all the mirrors
[11:34:33] <alloy> is it best to do an Syu before installing anything (I guess yes)

[11:38:30] <alloy> kewl cheers :D
[11:38:42] <thurstylark> but that might be less desirable than using something like kernel-modules-hook to keep your modules around so you don't have to reboot right away
[11:39:00] <thurstylark> depends on what you want do do with your system
[11:39:51] <alloy> it's mainly to do with the kernel modules for vmware workstation... vmware, bless 'em, don't release them at the same rate as the latest kernel, or even lts sometimes.  messes with work stuff.

[14:49:31] <Ghosthree3> usually i just vimdiff the two configs and copy over the changes i made myself
[14:49:42] <Ghosthree3> then move the pacnew over the config
[14:50:13] <mpan> pacman will also not magically bring down services, which may need being brought down, or restart programs depending on updated packages. It’s up to you to decide what requires that intervention.

[14:51:20] <Edu4rdSHL> Ghosthree3, pacdiff is very practical imo 
[14:51:24] <Ghosthree3> checkservices can do that for you, but it's an all of nothing job
[14:51:33] <Ghosthree3> Edu4rdSHL: probably, ive just never tried it
[14:52:26] <mpan> As for checking for affected binaries, `htop` displays them in yellow or red. In case you use `htop`.
[14:53:01] <mpan> But there is of course no magic that will tell you what you need to restart. Most programs will be just fine without any restarts.
[14:53:20] <Ghosthree3> yes there is, checkservices does that
[14:53:41] <mpan> No, it does not. It only reports changed files.
[14:53:48] <mpan> (just like `htop` does)
[14:55:13] <chiselfuse> mpan: hmm.. i don't even have this keycloak package

[14:55:38] <chiselfuse> yea i wasn't sure
[14:55:44] <mpan> Edu4rdSHL: but not magically determining if the restart is needed.
[14:56:06] <mpan> That requires intelligence and understanding what the change brings.
[14:56:07] *** Quits: indux (~Thunderbi@94.139.8.250) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:56:09] <Edu4rdSHL> Ah yes, ofc
[14:57:19] <Edu4rdSHL> Also it doesn't map user services 
[14:57:30] <Ghosthree3> what is this doing (^) if not telling you what should be restarted, or are you saying it doesn't catch everything
[14:58:29] <mpan> Ghosthree3: it indicates modifications. But a modification rarely implies “definitely must restart” and “not restarted” usually does not mean a problem.
[14:58:36] <mpan> (yes, those are two separate things)
[14:58:48] <Ghosthree3> ah, true, it only says 'may need restart'
[14:59:00] <mpan> Most programs will work flawlessly after the modification, because the files are already opened/mapped and the update doesn’t affect that.
[14:59:13] <Ghosthree3> i wish instead of yes you could use 1 2 3 ^4 because some things i dont want to restart, so i end up doing it all by hand
[14:59:45] <Ghosthree3> its also giving me this today, which is uh, scary, ● shadow.service loaded failed failed Verify integrity of password and group files
[15:00:05] <mpan> At the same time an update may bring important security/safety updates, which WILL be indicated by such htop or checkservices, but you will not know if the change is actually a security/safety change.

[15:02:21] <mpan> For 10 years of using Arch I never restarted a program after an update, unless I knew I need to from other sources, and I can’t even recall any specific issue (though I remember there were a few). Since `htop` marks such programs, I routinely do cleanups in processes, but I perceive that as my own perfectionism and “doing things right”. Not as a serious necessity.
[15:02:37] <Ghosthree3> the only thing ive found i HAVE to restart is smb.service
[15:02:46] <Ghosthree3> breaks shares every time the kernel updates and i have no idea how
[15:03:09] <astralc> firefox usually complain to restart it after update
[15:03:23] <Ghosthree3> at least it restarts itself
[15:03:37] <Ghosthree3> shares will just fail with no indication of the problem
[15:03:37] <astralc> I had few times that pulseaudio & pipewire need restart
[15:03:46] <mpan> Yeah, but it tells you that. And yeah, nss/firefox update is one of the times a restart is certainly required.
[15:04:19] <astralc> and of course, restart after kernel update (otherwise some thing won't work)
[15:04:28] <Ghosthree3> not true

[15:06:10] <Ghosthree3> no, kernel upgrade wont break an active system, just stops new (unloaded) modules being loaded. but if you downgrade or preserve the boot kernel modules that will still work too
