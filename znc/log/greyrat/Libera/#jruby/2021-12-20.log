[04:19:07] <nowherefast[m]> I'll put that `require_relative` quirk up as an issue then, thanks.
[04:23:34] <nowherefast[m]> byteit101, did have to catch up on your PRs :) thanks for doing that. The only thing I had to tweak was the gem reference at https://github.com/jruby/jrubyfx/blob/master/lib/jrubyfx_tasks.rb#L100 when jarifying. I don't make use of FXML though, so can only confirm success for the programatic approach.
[16:28:17] <edipofederle[m]> Morning (from Brazil)! ,
[16:28:17] <edipofederle[m]> enebo  I pushed some updates to https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6970 following your review (thanks for that), please, when you have some time, let me know if I've addressed all of them correctly,
[17:23:36] <enebo[m]> edipo.federle: there are still a few .get() calls for both RubyHash and RubyArray.  I think I will merge and then just update those
[17:24:28] <edipofederle[m]> enebo[m]: ouch, I can check/do it today if you prefer, up to you, just le me know
[17:25:07] <edipofederle[m]> you was faster :d
[17:42:06] <enebo[m]> I am doing it.  Thanks for the PR.  This is just a few calls.  Simple enough.  I will also add some javadocs on the methods you were using.  One of them for sure has no docs saying it is for Java integration only
[17:42:57] <edipofederle[m]> enebo[m]: great. Thx!
