[01:51:44] <gilberth> The xterm "redisplay" code is horrible. Problem is: There is no proper redisplay code, it is one of those silly applications, which make a change to the internal state and then guess the drawing needed to reflect that change and send it synchronously. Instead of just having a central redisplay function which compares the old display list with the new one and be set.

[05:52:11] <gilberth> Nice. Which CPUs have that?
[05:52:37] <hayley> All with the BMI1 extension.
[05:53:03] <gilberth> Funny. I can read, the page says so. But which ones are that?
[05:53:13] <hayley> "introduced in conjunction with the Advanced Vector Extensions SIMD instruction set"
[05:53:21] <hayley> Anything since 2010-ish?
[05:53:43] <hayley> Sandy Bridge and newer for Intel, Bulldozer and newer for AMD
[05:54:27] <gilberth> Indeed, mine also has that. Why haven't I ever seen it in compiler output?
[05:54:33] * hayley unpacks the SIMD register, returning 8 fixnums rather than one pack object, and it now takes 5.7ns. Makes sense.
[05:55:03] <hayley> Well, IIRC there's also been BT since the 386 for bit vectors, but the SBCL developers found that BT on memory was a stinking mess, and only BT on a register was any good.
[05:55:45] <hayley> ...so you still shift right to pick the right word, but then use BT to extract the bit, rather than shifting and masking the word.
[05:56:15] <gilberth> Isn't BT just "bit test"?
[05:56:21] <hayley> Yes.
[05:57:46] <hayley> So you still need a CMOV to get the 0/1 value. But I suppose you branch on the values of bit vectors frequently enough.

[08:35:37] <gilberth> hayley: Is it finished yet?
[08:35:48] <hayley> We can do read barriers due to superscalar execution (though, arguably a setback from having them in hardware).

[08:37:15] <dave0> gilberth: ah! ad-blocker!
[08:37:35] <gilberth> hayley: I bet the Symbolics still was microcoded.
[08:37:39] <hayley> Also, Moon's paper describes doing generation checking with extra hardware.
[08:38:28] <hayley> "As you may or may not know, the Symbolics 3600 had fairly complex GC hardware and the Symbolics Ivory went 90% of the way towards riscifying it, eliminating all the large hardware tables. I think there was still a 16x1 bit (NOT 16Kx1 !) table to indicate which portions of address space are oldspace; with 64 address bits instead of 32 you were able to reduce that to a single bit, which is nice."
[08:38:58] <gilberth> Qwnavery: You think I should by $INTC?
[08:39:31] <gilberth> buy
[08:40:22] <gilberth> hayley: Perhaps. You win, when you show me how to clock that at 3GHz.
[08:41:10] <hayley> OTOH apparently a write barrier in hardware is still not worth it: "here's the difference: a 'card-mark write barrier' can be fairly cheaply done with plain-o-instructions, so the write-barrier instruction is a delta above that. The biggest change is our write-barrier op 'filters' card-marks that don't need to happen which in turn cuts down on useless card-mark writes."
[08:41:13] <hayley> https://web.archive.org/web/20100302033837/http://blogs.azulsystems.com/cliff/2008/11/a-brief-conversation-with-david-moon.html
[08:43:41] <Qwnavery> gilberth: idk, not my call I'm not a financial advisor. Depends if you've got disposable income. You should do your own research or find a financial consultant.
[08:44:37] <hayley> But Moon claims that there is hardware (2.3% of the processor) which looks up the page and checks if it is in oldspace, i.e. a hardware-accelerated read barrier.
[08:45:30] <gilberth> Qwanvery: It's seldom that my gut feelingw are wrong. I won't buy $INTC although they pay a nice dividend.
[08:46:16] <gilberth> hayley: You still need to react on that barrier.
[08:46:27] <hayley> The same hardware also does a write barrier for generational GC, which implements a card map.

[08:59:24] <gilberth> Yes, and our current hardware is very good at it. Better than I speculated, that's the good news.

[09:04:00] * hayley hopes ElectroBOOM didn't design elevator phones
[09:04:22] <gilberth> Ah. He knows what he is talking about.
[09:05:12] <gilberth> Apropos connectors: You're doomed when you join aluminum and cooper cables. As this was the case at my former^3 place.

[09:16:34] <hayley> Still, this GC should run fine on a machine like https://i.redd.it/iq1zdetm8su71.jpg on the right. But larger ones are "basically" just the same with moar cores and RAM.

[09:18:06] <shka> hayley: you CAN connect aluminum to copper  
[09:18:15] <shka> but you gonna need special connector
[09:18:16] <hayley> Hey, gilberth said that.
[09:18:25] <shka> oh, sorry
[09:18:54] <gilberth> Indeed, you need special connectors. Which weren't used at my former^3 place.
[09:19:05] <shka> it burned down?
[09:19:24] <gilberth> And the colour scheme was ancient, but then I never rely on the cable colours. Never!
[09:20:59] <gilberth> shka: No. But I had a some smoke emitted at my former^5 home. Luckily I was there when that happened and could turn off power quick. Note to myself: Bring a flash light when you pull the main breaker at night, because lights run on electricity.
[09:21:36] <shka> right
[09:21:53] <gilberth> Or at least a lighter, so you find your way out.
[09:22:18] <hayley> But still, I optimise on my desktop, then run my code on a "little" machine like a Pi 4, and it's still faster. Usually works out the same.
[09:22:41] <shka> only smoking people carry lighter
[09:22:58] <gilberth> Well, I am a professional smoker.

[22:30:13] <gilberth> I never got why people buy water in bottles when there is tap water.
[22:31:11] <selwyn> bottled water shortages are fairly common here now because bottled water is a low priority in the supply chain
[22:31:17] <selwyn> high volume low $
[22:32:04] <selwyn> i prefer not to drink bottled water because of the environmental cost, and the plastic in the bottles is not good for you
[22:32:18] <selwyn> maybe san peligrino in the glass bottles
[22:33:37] <gilberth> Which is all about marketing. I personally don't like the taste of San Peligrino.
[22:33:55] <selwyn> scottish tap water is one of the best in the world, but the rest of us are not so lucky
[22:36:30] <gilberth> Anyhow, I am back at parsing C. Which is a nightmare, because the grammar is context sensitive and you'll find duplicate typedef's in header files, which according to the grammar is a syntax error.
[22:37:41] <gilberth> I thought I could do with the AST datatype of libclang, but it lacks some information. It is designed for indexing, that is m-.
[22:39:16] <gilberth> My idea is to use a GLR parser, which can return multiple interpretations of the input.

[23:27:08] <selwyn> unsure why that is tbh. file under things that are just done differently
[23:27:09] <GreaseMonkey> straight up, if everyone used open-source operating systems and software, we'd potentially see gruntier ARM desktops that aren't Macs
[23:27:12] <selwyn> like those electric heaters
[23:27:36] <selwyn> i think that tap water that people actually drink is a good system
[23:27:50] <Alfr> gilberth, as those aren't inherently unsafe but unusually hard to use right.
[23:27:56] <GreaseMonkey> well yeah, the alternative to that is tap water that sucks so much that you have to pay for the water you drink in practice
[23:28:09] <pl> GreaseMonkey: ARM is self-selecting out by continuing shittiest possible firmware situation
[23:28:46] <selwyn> but people often drink bottled water even if the tap water is not that bad

[23:28:51] <selwyn> which i find hard to understand
[23:28:57] <pl> GreaseMonkey: even worse?
[23:29:23] <pl> I mean, if you want shitty firmware that makes it impossible to make portable OS, you go for "open sauce" boards usually
[23:29:33] <GreaseMonkey> ah righty
[23:29:40] <pl> (shining exceptions: OpenPOWER and few limited ARM vendors)
[23:30:20] <GreaseMonkey> i'd've thought at least the admittedly overpriced SiFive boards aimed for u-boot and OpenSBI
[23:30:56] <pl> GreaseMonkey: uBoot is in the "as good as useless" class
[23:31:12] <pl> I mean, it tells you /absolutely nothing/ on whether you'll face usable firmware
[23:31:18] <GreaseMonkey> ah righty
[23:32:07] <GreaseMonkey> the other thing is the ZSBL (zeroth stage bootloader) built into the CPU does give you a pointer to a DTB once it jumps to its initial target
[23:32:16] <GreaseMonkey> although there's a chance that it'll be scuffed
[23:32:27] <pl> DTB is also not enough
[23:32:38] <GreaseMonkey> in other words it's about as good as ACPI?
[23:32:40] <pl> GreaseMonkey: note that OpenSBI group simply plans on bringing UEFI in
[23:33:01] <pl> GreaseMonkey: possibly less - ACPI and device tree overlap but not fully on featureset
[23:33:09] <pl> some stuff is better on ACPI, some on device tree
[23:33:34] <pl> and DTB is a frankenstein because linux kernel people said they will stop accepting new platform configs
[23:33:44] <GreaseMonkey> i was more thinking in terms of the "it's actually broken" aspect
[23:33:53] <pl> s/frankenstein/frankensten's monster that exists only/
[23:33:58] <pl> GreaseMonkey: ACPI isn't broken
[23:34:03] <GreaseMonkey> typically ACPI tables can be quite broken and rely on Windows bugs
[23:34:07] <pl> most open source ideas about firmware are
[23:34:23] <pl> GreaseMonkey: ACPI the technology and "Gigabyte/Apple fucked up again" are two different things
[23:34:31] <GreaseMonkey> fair enough
[23:35:01] <pl> and they do not rely on Windows bugs, they just only tested enough to pass them, and there used to be issues where intel reference interpreter would barf on bytecode from MS compiler
[23:35:47] <pl> GreaseMonkey: another issue with open source firmware is that the standards are /not exhaustive enough/
[23:35:58] <pl> which makes a problem even for full SBSA systems on ARM
[23:36:12] <pl> because there's no Windows to crib requiremnts from

And the sheer number of overflow bugs show that, no, the programmer doesn't know best. I mean this is hilarious, we have computers for doing work for us, yet I must check every single return value for error, every single arithmetic for overflow or reason about why that can't happen, while the m

[23:46:17] <Alfr> gilberth, but what you mentioned also describes all the hardware we have and to which all programs have to be mapped somehow. But I do concur that most programmers shouldn't have to deal with that.
[23:46:48] <selwyn> i want to get a brick phone which i can flash with minimal risk of, well, bricking the brick phone
[23:46:59] <selwyn> no idea how to start looking
[23:47:49] <pl> selwyn: you want to get something that has appropriately separated radio chip. Androids make it easies ;)

[23:48:18] <selwyn> but i like brick phones
[23:48:23] <selwyn> no distraction
[23:49:44] <selwyn> people often make fun of me for using them. plan is to give the brick phone some smart capabilities for some wow factor
[23:50:06] <GreaseMonkey> i'd like to have a brick phone that does at least 3G but has no camera

[23:52:19] <pl> selwyn: you can gut an analog phone, or find old broken brick NMT nokia, and put some bits from a smartphone with cut-down firmware
[23:52:45] <selwyn> this is also a possibility
[23:53:49] <selwyn> would like to deal with flashing an already existing phone first though
[23:54:12] <pl> reminds me that someone in warsaw hackerspace got his hands on german bundeswehr field phone, which afaik uses xDSL

[23:54:31] <selwyn> 'analog phone' lol
[23:54:38] <selwyn> give a rotary dial phone 5g
[23:54:41] <pl> with space for internal battery and ability to just wrap few wires
[23:54:54] <pl> selwyn: that would be a lot of sand with anxiety
[23:55:07] <pl> considering how it would have to run IPsec and IPv6 :D
[23:55:21] <pl> (possibly transparently for your code, though)
[23:55:44] <pl> NMT was also analog
[23:58:19] <selwyn> can analog computing return?
[23:59:12] <pl> doubtful. It has its uses, but there are reasons it dropped off
[23:59:27] <pl> I don't think anyone managed to make it generally programmable, for example
