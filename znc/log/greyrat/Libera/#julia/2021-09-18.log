[12:10:45] <ninjin> I know it is only a few of us here on IRC, but our existence was “denied” a few days ago over on the Julia Slack and I spoke up stating that: “No, we still exist, despite the freenode implosion we ‘stayed with the network’ and are now on Libera”.
[12:12:37] <ninjin> Following this I got authorisation to make our presence official and this has now happened and I am allowed to “claim” the Julia namespace on Libera. Not forseeing any changes to things here, other than a change of the topic line and me filing a PR to the Julia website repository so that we can hopefully get some more friends in here.

[15:30:43] * dTal toasts ninjin
[15:31:08] <dTal> Time to change the topic, then?
[15:31:37] <ninjin> Cheers dTal and mikko. Not much credit belong to me really though, I think idling and being active is far more valuable than anything I have done.
[15:31:54] <ninjin> Yeah, I suppose so dTal. But let my try to “claim” it now with ChanServ and see what happens.
[15:32:41] <ninjin> I asked them to be about as liberal as they could about the namespace etc. as I see little point in doing this top down.
[15:33:11] <ninjin> Options like “no `julia*` channels without approval” seemed heavy handed to say the least.
[15:42:14] <ninjin> Okay, claimed and thankfully I am not seeing any real difference.
[15:42:42] <ninjin> Thoughts on topic? “https://julialang.org | Stable: v1.6.2 | LTS: v1.0.5” or maybe “A high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language | https://julialang.org | Stable: v1.6.2 | LTS: v1.0.5”?
[15:43:06] <ninjin> I am about as artistic as a slab of granite, so please do help.

[18:10:49] <ninjin> I can hardly wait for v1.0.5 to stop being our LTS… Maintaining it is a royal pain at this point.

[20:00:32] <dTal> I liked "marvellous", put it back!
[20:01:26] <dTal> In my opinion the topic is a place to assert the culture of the room, not repeat information that anyone who has found their way this far is likely to know already or at least know how to google for
