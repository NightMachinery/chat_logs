[01:17:04] <kjetilho> hrm, I don't understand why File::Tail is so slow in reacting to new lines in the file I'm watching.  more than a minute.  I've specified  interval => 1, max_interval => 2, what more do I need?
[01:17:38] <LeoNerd> What is writing new lines? Is it flushing out fast?
[01:17:51] <kjetilho> yes, tail -f sees the lines
[01:18:20] <LeoNerd> Consider piping from `tail -f`. Or use something inotify-based
[01:18:25] <LeoNerd> I don't *think* File::Tail does that
[01:18:26] <gordonfish> I've had good luck doing tailing via IO::Async
[01:21:25] <kjetilho> I don't need subsecond response, but 1-2 second response would be nice.  IO::Async seems a bit heavy to use..  using tail -f is much easier code, I guess :)
[01:21:29] <tirnanog> in addition to piping from tail -f, IO::BufferedSelect is decent.

[06:56:36] <aquanight> I'm just going to assume WSL thought of that.
[06:56:56] <aquanight> the answer is probably "whatever the system codepage is"
[06:57:05] <aquanight> like it usually is for the -A APIs
[06:57:25] <aquanight> but maybe they were smart and went for utf8
[06:58:01] <aquanight> that might be bad though because mingw has to turn the LPWSTR cmdline back into main's argc/argv
[06:58:23] <aquanight> and that's almost certainly going to be a codepage conversion

[10:02:03] <dansan> Hello #perl!  Is there a way to get a backtrace of a perl program (not run with -d)?  strace reveals that it's in a tight little loop calling select with a zero time out, but having the backtrace would really help.
[10:03:00] <dansan> I guess I could probably modify the program and run it with -d and simulate the situation, but it's caused a rare failure in an external device.

[18:51:03] <pj> Can break be used to break out of a sort?
[18:52:13] <simcop2387> pj: i don't believe so, it's not a loop really.  what would the result be?
[18:53:16] <pj> ...something like: SORT: { my @ar = sort { break SORT if $a == 12345; $a <=> $b; } @inar; }
[18:53:25] <alh> No
[18:53:31] <alh> And... why would you want to do that?
[18:54:04] <pj> because I want to check for a certain value while I'm sorting in the input array and if it's encountered then the sort becomes needless.
[18:54:08] <haj1> IIRC break isn't for loops either... it is for dropping out of a 'given' block (which has its own dangers)
[18:54:18] <Altreus> pj: find the value and sort the slice
[18:54:43] <Altreus> See List::Util::firstidx or wherever it is
[18:54:48] <alh> pj: Check for the value first
[18:54:55] <alh> And only sort if it's not needless
[18:55:22] <pj> I can do that, but if I check for it during the sort then I avoid having to loop through an extra time.
[18:55:39] <alh> sorting needlessly is way more work than checking through the list once
[18:55:47] <pj> hrmmmm, good point
[18:56:33] <Altreus> oh I see, I misread (i.e. didn't read) your message
[18:57:26] <pj> yeah, well, I think technically I would be breaking out of the block that is surrounding the sort, but I wanted to know if doing that would (1) do what I think, and (2) cause any weird side-effects.
[18:57:49] <pj> Although I think I'll just loop through and check first like alh suggests, still curious if it would work, though.
[18:57:59] <alh> No, you can't really break out of that block
[18:58:31] <pj> I htink break is the wrong keyword, actually, it would be last.

[20:01:39] <Altreus> I can see why you'd have a separate delimiter for each half
[20:02:07] <Altreus> Easy to construct a situation where you'd need toothpicks on one half if you couldn't
[20:04:11] <haj1> I would welcome if s}}} was deprecated.  It makes editor support really colorful. When you type "s" at the end of a nested block, cperl-mode picks the following end-of-block } as delimiter, and marks the following two block-ending } as the other delimiters of search and replacement... switching back as soon as you continue typing.  I guess this is a challenge for tree-sitter, too, if it wants to do incremental parsing

[23:44:13] <Guest28> simcop2387: I will try the command again. I kind of love the design of Guix. The reproducibility stuff I am sort of irrationally drawn to. Being all done in lisp adds to my liking of it a lot, compared to something that would be limited by a json configuration file or similar.
[23:47:39] <simcop2387> <fanatic>It's *SCHEME* not Lisp! It's completely different!</fanatic>  Yea the whole idea of not only is the system created by configuration alone, and is supposed to be completely reproducible, is really interesting to me too.  I've tried nix before to see if i could use it as a good way to manage/create VMs that shared stuff in common but I never had the time to get things right or completely
[23:47:45] <simcop2387> understand it.	I think guix's use of a full langauge might actually make some things easier to deal with for me.  It strikes me a lot like using Puppet/Chef/Ansible/etc. to setup/build the infrastructure and treating all of the system the same way.
[23:47:58] <Guest28> simcop2387 I run a ganeti cluster with guix as the host OS, so I can take a config.scm and push out Guix hosts. Then run guix deploy on them. It's all kind of amazing.
