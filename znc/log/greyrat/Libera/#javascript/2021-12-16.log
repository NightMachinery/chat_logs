[00:57:50] <banana_> stenno: <button>'s can be disabled
[00:58:18] <banana_> by default have that feature I guess you could make it work for <a> with own code
[00:58:45] <tmm88> it's generally speaking very easy to make a button in react or angular. you call a node formular and you fall the examples and you are done. unless you wan to go with the vanilla style of code

[01:00:33] <stenno> both templates?
[01:01:00] <banana_> yeah like the template syntax for react and angular support html XD
[01:01:29] <banana_> whatever correct term im talking about the template markup
[01:01:46] <stenno> the 'template syntax' is JSX
[01:01:56] <banana_> yeah
[01:02:12] <banana_> but it supports html markup
[01:02:20] <stenno> thats not quite correct
[01:02:32] <banana_> thats why you can have html syntax inside jsx
[01:02:35] <banana_> it's not?
[01:02:37] <stenno> no
[01:02:58] <banana_> what's more correct then
[01:02:58] <stenno> JSX is a DSL which gets transpiled by babel into javascript
[01:03:13] <banana_> DSL stands for
[01:03:22] <stenno> if you write <button> it gets changed by babel into React.createElement('button', ...)
[01:03:36] <stenno> domain specific language
[01:03:52] <banana_> thanks
[01:03:57] <stenno> its just a fancy way to write React.createElement
[01:04:06] <banana_> ok whatever yeah but common
[01:04:22] <banana_> maybe im confused here

[01:05:18] <ljharb> banana_: no
[01:05:22] <ljharb> banana_: no html strings whatsoever
[01:05:29] <ljharb> banana_: jsx is transpiled in react into an object tree.

[01:05:56] <banana_> I think that's what I meant I said jsx "supports" html syntax
[01:06:04] <ljharb> jsx is like XHTML-compliant HTML5, with a few differences and improvements
[01:06:19] <ljharb> things that work in html won't work in jsx, which is why it doesn't support html syntax
[01:06:25] <banana_> ok yeah I get that like the className attribute difference
[01:06:32] <ljharb> nonzero things, rather
[01:06:40] <ljharb> but also the requirement of self-closing slashes
[01:06:47] <ljharb> html allows `<p>`, jsx requires `<p />`

[01:07:44] <banana_> alright well whatever ok so like me refine

[01:08:26] <banana_> not a complete standardized version of HTML though

[01:14:05] <ljharb> banana_: it is a UX problem
[01:14:15] <ljharb> banana_: it's also a technical one, because html tags should be semantic
[01:14:30] <banana_> so I should tell my UX team they should ask use to make link-buttons ever
[01:14:37] <ljharb> banana_: things that take you somewhere refreshable should be a link. things that do something or submit a form should be a button
[01:14:41] <ljharb> banana_: yes, you should.

[01:17:05] <banana_> ljharb: yeah for sure just wondering if it's their call at the end of the day.
[01:17:18] <ljharb> it might be. but that doesn't make them right, it just means you don't have a choice
[01:17:54] <ljharb> eg, infield labels are a horrifically bad pattern, one that's explicitly discouraged by the spec itself, and twitter and facebook used them for years anyways because the designers thought they were prettier

[07:26:00] <Smashcat> wroathe: It's not really needed now that they added the property to the map object anyway though. Since you just enable panning, then use setCenter()...

[14:35:12] <DnzAtWrk> lol
[14:35:18] <DnzAtWrk> what are the odds that it's a timezone aware datepicker
[14:35:23] <DnzAtWrk> that would be a PITA
[14:35:36] <theskillwithin> you could do that without using a ref and effect
[14:35:44] <matsaman> yeah it's interesting how little software we have these days that's timezone aware
[14:35:54] <DnzAtWrk> I prefer timezone naive things
[14:35:57] <DnzAtWrk> it makes things less complicated
[14:36:11] <matsaman> it's really good in some situations, awareness
[14:36:16] <matsaman> like planning a trip
[14:36:23] <DnzAtWrk> I've had a huge pain trying to use datepickers before
[14:36:25] <matsaman> scheduling meetings...
[14:36:34] <DnzAtWrk> as they were using timezone aware datetimes but didn't expose the timezone
[14:36:36] <DnzAtWrk> fun times
[14:36:54] <DnzAtWrk> well what I mean is, the datetimes it used was produced from local time

[20:24:06] <jaawerth> in that specific example you can do `for (let i = 0, x = 0, y = 0; i < array.length; i++, y++, x++) { ... }` but I wouldn't get too cute about it, it could lead to confusing code when you use commas to smush a bunch of side effects into a single expression like that

[20:25:17] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> yeah, I know, but my code defines axioms...
[20:25:27] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> I can't just name them same letter
[20:25:35] <jaawerth> I assume it was an over-simplified example, but yeah generally I'd probably handle x and y in the body and let the loop expr just be the parts that are driving the loop
[20:25:54] <chao> unless you modify the actual index variable which is even even worse than just using 3-clause for loops

[22:06:35] <EdFletcher> i even asked the team if we could just go back to version 12 for awhile but they've already made some changes that make that impossible, or so they say...
[22:07:16] <PenguinMan98> 'impossible' is often a convenient cover for 'we're nervous about trying that'

[22:09:55] <EdFletcher> i only have to work on our iOS apps occasionally and i swear _every single time_ i come back to them, the build process or toolchain is broken again (either internally by our team's hand or externally because Xcode et. al is broken again). it's such an infuriating experience.

[23:59:30] <silly> when the captain of the ferry says position on through his walkie talkie, it means that the ship won't move any more, so the ramp for cars can fully be lowered. now if the ramp is lowered when the ship still moves, it will most likely be damaged.
