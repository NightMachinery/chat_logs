[01:33:56] <constxd> apotheon: how to start learning spells tho
[01:47:33] <apotheon> practice, projects, and a good book perhaps
[01:47:42] <apotheon> probably need a wizard's tome, yeah
[01:47:47] <constxd> need fast track
[01:47:55] <weaksauce> eye of newt it is
[01:47:56] <constxd> what is the optimal wizard's tome
[01:48:18] <apotheon> Oh!  Well, there's a fast-track method, called Learn Programming in Only Ten Years!
[01:48:32] <constxd> i don't need to learn programming just ruby
[01:48:37] <apotheon> The novice's tome for Ruby is Eloquent Ruby.
[01:48:50] <apotheon> Ah, that's much quicker than learning programming.
[01:49:27] <constxd> but i want to understand all the magic that most resources gloss over
[01:50:26] <apotheon> Start with Eloquent Ruby, then go to POODR or Understanding Computation, then whichever of them you didn't already read, then Metaprogramming Ruby.
[01:50:30] <apotheon> There's your path.
[01:50:42] <constxd> what if i start with metaprogramming ruby
[01:50:56] <constxd> will i be lost
[01:51:15] <apotheon> It turns out that's actually kind of a fast-track except maybe Understanding Computation (it depends on the student), because they're all very well-written books that are easy and fun for the talented student to get through.
[01:51:19] <apotheon> probably
[01:51:29] <apotheon> You'll definitely skip some very important stuff.
[01:51:52] <apotheon> Going straight to Metaprogramming Ruby is a great way to be a danger to yourself and others.
[01:52:14] <apotheon> There's some deep magic in Understanding Computation, too.
[01:52:29] <apotheon> I *suppose* you could get to Understanding Computation *after* Metaprogramming Ruby.
[01:52:39] <constxd> what about ruby under the microscope or whatever
[01:52:48] <apotheon> . . . but you should definitely get POODR between Eloquent and Metaprogramming.
[01:53:21] <apotheon> I haven't read it, yet, but I'd recommend that only after the other four.  For one thing, it won't be as useful to you until you've gotten that far.
[01:53:40] <apotheon> probably won't, anyway; as I said, I haven't read it yet
[01:53:56] *** Quits: TCZ (~tcz@91.150.178.124) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:54:30] <constxd> most of the programming i do is in my own toy language and it's so satisfying when you have good mental model of what everything is doing under the hood
[01:55:00] <constxd> then i'll run into something where i need a language with a better ecosystem and get frustrated because i don't understand exactly how everything works

[01:55:25] <constxd> i want to know ruby as well as i know my own language so it feels automatic to write
[01:57:30] <apotheon> Well . . . I guess you could go for Microscope sooner, if you're less interested in wizardry-quickly.
[01:57:45] <constxd> man $85 cad for paperback Eloquent Ruby
[01:57:55] <apotheon> That's more sage area, not wizard area.
[01:58:01] <apotheon> Holy shit.  Why is it that expensive?
[01:58:19] <apotheon> Go somewhere piracy is legal and get an ebook.
[01:59:13] <apotheon> (I think it's kinda clever how I avoided running afoul of the IRC network's rules against illegal stuff.)
[01:59:27] <apotheon> I'm kidding, obviously.
[01:59:59] <apotheon> Wow, it's about 53 USD on Amazon for the paperback.
[02:00:49] <newton> wonder if there aren't so many copies anymore? it was $30 USD in 2012 :^)
[02:01:56] <newton> library genesis, a totally real and normal library, has a lot of programming ebooks. encourage buying books that are reasonably priced.

[02:03:37] <newton> same. I tried doing the ebook thing, still prefer having the real thing on my shelf
[02:04:11] <weaksauce> i've seen eloquent ruby on github in a country where piracy is legal 
[02:04:57] <weaksauce> i think it's out of print?
[02:04:58] <newton> github would remove it if it was DMCA'd, since github is in a jurisdiction where it isn't legal, I think
[02:05:20] <apotheon> newton: It's a nice library.
[02:05:48] <apotheon> newton: I agree with the encouragement of reasonably priced book sales.
[02:06:12] <apotheon> My big problem with Eloquent Ruby is the pricing and (if they're still doing it) DRM.
[02:06:36] <newton> i think weaksauce is right that it's probably not in print anymore. 11 years old now
[02:06:54] <legit> I wish Eloquent Ruby got an update
[02:07:07] <apotheon> constxd: get it from the friendly library
[02:07:09] <weaksauce> you could shoot him an email if you want http://eloquentruby.com/pages/about/
[02:07:25] <weaksauce> though is he dead?
[02:07:30] <apotheon> newton: An epaper style ereader goes a long way toward making ebooks better.
[02:07:47] <weaksauce> guess not he retweeted someone last year
[02:08:05] <newton> weaksauce, he liked a 21h old tweet recently too
[02:08:16] <newton> I was not prepared to hear russ olsen died :')
[02:08:16] <weaksauce> oh that's good
[02:08:21] <legit> weaksauce: doesn't seem dead, but more interested in Clojure now
[02:08:24] <apotheon> newton: They're still different from dead tree format, but I find a DRM-free EPUB sideloaded on an epaper-style ereader is a trade-off rather than inferior.
[02:08:37] <weaksauce> i just saw his website hadn't been updated since 2015
[02:08:38] <legit> And Haskell heh
[02:08:43] <weaksauce> the copyright thing
[02:09:05] <apotheon> Yeah, he wrote a Clojure book in 2018, apparently.
[02:09:08] <apotheon> bummer
[02:09:39] <apotheon> Does Clojure compile to object code via LLVM yet?
[02:09:42] <weaksauce> the pdf of it was formatted well 
[02:09:55] <apotheon> weaksauce: . . . of which?
[02:09:55] <weaksauce> i don't think epub is workable for programming books
[02:10:01] <apotheon> Why not?
[02:10:04] <weaksauce> eh the eloquent ruby
[02:10:07] <apotheon> PDFs are fucking *awful*.
[02:10:19] <apotheon> I found the EPUB of Eloquent quite nice.
[02:10:35] <weaksauce> probably is yeah since ruby code is double space indented 
[02:10:47] <apotheon> Some programming books are definitely not as good in EPUBs, but that's largely a matter of how you organize the book, I think.
[02:10:50] <weaksauce> and most of it was prose anyway
[02:11:19] <weaksauce> and my physical copy is fairly small for a programming book too
[02:11:36] <apotheon> Head First C was not well-formatted for EPUB.  Holy crap.
[02:11:49] <apotheon> It's also a Head First book, so . . . y'know, there are going to be issues.

[02:12:15] <apotheon> It's notable, though, in that the topic areas it covers is about 50% of the way toward a C equivalent to Eloquent Ruby, which was interesting.

[02:16:38] <apotheon> constxd: Stay away from IDEs when learning it if you want to gain wizard skills, too.
[02:17:28] <constxd> dont worry i would never use a ruby ide
[02:17:49] <constxd> well maybe an lsp server

[02:19:13] <newton> solargraph is a good lsp for ruby, though it struggles with large apps
[02:19:26] <apotheon> Using "smart" tools for it will hinder your development of wizardry.

[16:08:19] <havenwood> nakilon: It's about nonblocking I/O rather than pegging cores. Async works great for I/O, especially with Falcon. Ractors, once they're stable, should compliment Async for parallel computation.
[16:09:38] <havenwood> nakilon: Check this out, for example. https://gist.github.com/havenwood/6ac4d8c32f8af0364c27ffa26241db67
[16:10:30] <havenwood> This ^ worked when Ractors supported procs, which is now disabled but a key feature that needs to work again and should before Ractors are finalized.
[16:11:03] <havenwood> Async is already very usable but Ractors not so much.

[18:04:11] <havenwood> We could do something like that ^ level of abstraction, but seems it'll be up to the programmer to notice if blocking I/O is involved. At least a fair amount of usage can be obscured by libraries.
