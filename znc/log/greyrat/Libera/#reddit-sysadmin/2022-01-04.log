[00:07:20] <CableNinja> anyone here use vault heavily in scripts and such?
[00:07:55] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ansible vault no but getting into it
[00:08:05] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ive yet to find a way to have a decnt way to unlock it
[00:08:07] <JollyRoger> Jaelae: I'm not surprised. I've heard about high rates of burnout in those lines of work because the work environment and the nature of the work foisters toxicity and provides an environment where toxic people really thrive, then drive good people out. 
[00:08:11] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its so far passwords for passwords
[00:08:36] <JollyRoger> And the job stress!
[00:09:21] <CableNinja> Hotmess we have a separate vault for most everything, except a few small bullshitery files in the ansible repo, so we can unseal our vault servers via ansible no big deal
[00:09:49] <CableNinja> we're using approles for everything now, which is great, sorta... except now we have all these role and secret ids everywhere, and I dont know how to deal with keeping those secret
[00:10:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> KMS server
[00:10:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> not sure if that defeats the purpose of a ansible vault though
[00:10:30] <CableNinja> not talking about ansible vault
[00:10:32] <sd> 11<H​otmess> like i said passwords for passwords
[00:10:33] <CableNinja> just straight vault
[00:10:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> oh
[00:11:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> by hashicorp?
[00:11:09] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or something else?
[00:11:09] <CableNinja> yeah
[00:11:20] <sd> 14<K​illnine> We used Centrify and Azure Key Vault for secrets
[00:11:21] <CableNinja> we have vault role and secrets for various kvs, but not sure how to secure those role and secrets, or at least the secrets, in a decent way that devs and machines can pull / work with them
[00:11:27] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ive yet to get my hands on hashicorp vualt
[00:11:35] <CableNinja> its, alright... 
[00:11:43] <CableNinja> it works, but its kinda eh..
[00:11:51] <CableNinja> it has a UI too that you can use but I've never touched it
[00:12:06] <CableNinja> tbh I find a lot of these hashicorp tools pretty meh
[00:12:10] <sd> 14<K​illnine> We had a powershell script that pulled a cert from Centrify. So you're basically authorizing a machine to access a key store
[00:12:14] <CableNinja> they all have some problem one way or another
[00:12:40] <sd> 14<K​illnine> So devs could pull secrets at runtime via a 'full path' to the secret
[00:12:53] <sd> 14<K​illnine> But never really saw the secrets unless they were in a debugger
[00:13:20] <sd> 11<H​otmess> intresting
[00:13:28] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ps also supports REST
[00:13:31] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I really liked the idea. You can do the same with Azure KS
[00:13:39] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so you could theorieticaly use the api to pull the secrets
[00:13:44] <sd> 14<K​illnine> We kinda bastardized Centrify to do that
[00:13:44] <CableNinja> yeah it works like that for vault too killnine, except the cert thing I think?
[00:14:03] <CableNinja> hotmess yeah thats how I do my stuff, except bash/shell not PS
[00:14:13] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Its how we get away from needing to store passwords in source code
[00:14:29] <sd> 11<H​otmess> which is 100% reccomened practice now
[00:14:33] <sd> 14<K​illnine> For sure
[00:14:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> incase you get a source code leak 😉
[00:14:37] <CableNinja> but to make it so you dont have a raw password laying around, you use approles, and approles give you a role id and secret, which effectively gives you a user/pass thtats not really a user/pass
[00:14:42] <CableNinja> which drives me fucking bonkers
[00:14:59] <sd> 11<H​otmess> guids/uuid's in aad drives me fucking nuts
[00:15:33] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yes, it feels like passwords the whole way down until you start using something else (certs) at the very bottom
[00:16:02] <sd> 11<H​otmess> hosnlty may as well just use pki at that point from base 🤷
[00:16:05] <sd> 14<K​illnine> The only way to get the cert installed is through jumping through some hoops, including MFA. But once its on the device you know someone who had access to the device could get the secrets but oh well
[00:16:30] * CableNinja blows his brains out
[00:17:45] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Once its set up its actually quite nice. Lets you do dev/beta/prod environments and use the same secrets. They get loaded form the 'right place' at runtime. You can store stuff like connection strings in the store as well
[00:17:56] <sd> 14<K​illnine> So it connects to the 'right' thing at runtime based on a config
[00:18:33] <CableNinja> we dont have environments like that, so shit doesnt work quite like that
[00:18:43] <sd> 14<K​illnine> That's why I think AKS is better if you're already in .NET stack because the way .NET core does settings files lets you do that pretty easily. And all the packages already exist to connect.
[00:18:58] <sd> 14<K​illnine> You're probably not in .net but oh well 😛
[00:22:13] <CableNinja> we release os/applications in package form (linux), so all of our secrets shit is like during build time and all that bullshit, and at the most exposed, default passwords for the applications and shit, we've mostly gotten it all put into vault so those passwords arent out in the raw anymore, but now we have a role id and secret id floating around, and have to find a way of keeping those protected, unfortunately because we're building 
[00:22:13] <CableNinja> mostly os type shit, its all more or less makefiles and shit
[00:30:51] <sd> 12<f​elda> CableNinja what's your default passwords?
[00:31:08] <CableNinja> password123 obviously
[00:31:13] <sd> 12<f​elda> It's me, me ur brother
[00:31:22] <sd> 12<f​elda> That's the password on my luggage
[00:32:53] <sd> 12<f​elda> I feel blessed that we no longer have the dependency hell that is DirectX installers.
[00:33:27] <sd> 12<f​elda> 15 years ago no two games used the same DirectX. It was madness.
[00:35:09] <CableNinja> now instead we have 3000 dependencies which are all half maintained or less, and proprietary drivers everywhere
[00:36:19] <sd> 11<H​otmess> looks into crystal ball
[00:36:19] <sd> 11<H​otmess> "i see a log4j exploit in your future"
[00:36:22] <CableNinja> that problem does still exist for DirectX, its just that they've made everything ported in a way that enables features/capabilities per game/use, or even lowering the library used down to directx10
[00:37:00] <CableNinja> Hotmess, can you check again, I have a worrying fear about a well used package just totally disappearing from the internet, that could never happen right?! RIGHT?!

[02:24:58] <Gaboradon> I totally unserstand the usecase, but in my case there's like old programs with their configs, I just wouldn't want to throw out, and all I need is one single final backup image, so even if clonezilla is a kids toy it's actually the perfect solution to save the whole thing as is and recreate it on a press of a button if needed.

[08:11:47] <misspwn> shits wildddddddddddd
[08:12:49] <jay-ros> we were super disappointed for this one, I've got this coupon from my last company for a site called providoor; it's a bunch of good restaurants in the CBD which (because of lockdowns) have been delivering "almost complete" meals you finish and plate at home
[08:13:29] <jay-ros> ...and it turns out half were closed over the xmas break, and then the ones that ARE open only deliver for the weekend

[10:46:40] <A-KO> why is it that so many IT folks like to keep shit outdated?
[10:46:43] <A-KO> FFS update your shit
[10:46:50] <A-KO> so many fucking problems can be solved by just updating shit
[10:47:01] <A-KO> more problems can be solved by updating than it creates to actually update
[10:47:23] <A-KO> You're not making some reasonably 'intelligent' decision--just update. And most change notes don't document the full changes of what they've done
[10:48:37] <A-KO> For example, HP just released a new NIC driver for some of my servers. The version it was on (which was the most up-to-date until this month) was a driver from 2017. Version 4.1.76.0. The latest version from November of this year? 4.1.229.0. It's a re-branded Intel controller based on the Intel X540 platform. Intel has had 4 years of updates to their drivers since then that HP just 
[10:48:37] <A-KO> didn't release.
[10:48:44] <A-KO> you bet your ass I want that update heh
[10:49:03] <A-KO> sometimes it's just "supports product X"--and other times it's like "fixes issue with packet drops under these conditions."
[10:49:19] <A-KO> Sadly, Intel doesn't have proper changelogs going back that far so I don't have the full change history :(

[22:47:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> int0x1C8 yes I got mine
[22:47:32] <estranger> AnonymooseReddtr, they have a good ESP there?
[22:47:39] <princessalicorn> I got my booster a couple weeks back
[22:47:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> estranger yea
[22:47:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> And I got a bunch of stonks when I was hried
[22:47:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> hired
[22:47:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> but they gotta vest of course
[22:48:04] <estranger> ours is 15% off the lowest price during the ESP window, which is every 6 months .. pretty good
[22:48:12] <estranger> RSUs ?
[22:48:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> RSV?

[22:50:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> but on top of that I can also buy via the ESPP, and can get bonus stonks awards etc.  
[22:50:34] <estranger> before it was 0 vesting until 12 months, then vesting every month until 48 months
[22:50:41] <estranger> yah
[22:51:04] <estranger> apparenly my boss is trying to get me more shares this quarter, then I get a 3 year stock refresh in july... feelsgoodman 
[22:51:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> being in Canada rules are a bit different, but they also have a really good retirement matching plan 
[22:51:18] <estranger> and i got more shares last year for a promotion 
[22:51:21] <AnonymooseReddtr> first thing I did was max out my retirement matching every pay
[22:51:29] <estranger> yeah we dont do retirement matching at all right now
[22:53:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah that was a big one for me
[22:55:24] <fritzwastaken> giggity

[22:55:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> ?
[22:55:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> what wasn't too big?
[22:56:02] <estranger> most startups dont do matching, so its a bit of a gamble
[22:56:12] <estranger> if they have a good IPOy ou dont give a shit about matching... if they dont you end up behind
[22:56:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> right
[22:56:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> i suppose that is the risk of startuplife
