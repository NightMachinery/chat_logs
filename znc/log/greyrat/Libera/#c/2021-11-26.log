[14:36:03] <fizzie> Re the "zero importance" question, pretty sure the problem there is 1.4 being a floating type rather than the `*` operator. `(n+2)/3*4` would be the correct way to get the exact number of bytes needed to encode n bytes as base64, assuming the standard padding. (+1 if the result needs to be a string too.)
[14:38:29] <SymbioticFemale> fizzie: ah. that makes sense on that issue. thanks.

[15:05:05] <cousteau> Pro tip: you can comment out blocks of C code by surrounding them by `#if 0` ... `#endif`.  This has almost the same effect as using `/*` ... `*/`, except that they can be nested, won't be affected by the commented out code containing `/*...*/`, and the commented-out block will look like regular C in most code editors.

[15:06:19] <SymbioticFemale> dave0: i've narrowed it down to a potential error in crypto_box_seal_open(), where it seems to fail to decrypt but still returns 0. I'm not going to try to chase down that error because it's not in my code, but it's being triggered by mismanaged buffer sizes somewhere in my code, so i'm going to chase that down.
[15:06:50] <SymbioticFemale> crypto_box_seal_open() would be from libsodium
[15:07:21] <dave0> how did it make fgets lock up?
[15:07:45] <SymbioticFemale> yeah i don't know but commenting // decrypt() prevents the lockup

[17:43:44] <fizzie> "never let there be a label `label`" is pretty good.
[17:43:46] <apotheon> "never do nothing" seems either impossible or tautological, depending on your definition of doing something

[17:44:16] <cousteau> or does {case:} only work within a body of its own, and is otherwise part of an outer switch?
[17:44:36] <fizzie> No, the body of a switch statement doesn't need to be a block statement.
[17:44:47] <edk> case is pretty much exactly like a goto that can only be gone to by its switch
[17:44:56] <edk> er, like a goto label
[17:44:58] <cousteau> not the body, but the labeled elements

[18:10:38] <fizzie> Hmm, I wonder if anyone's done any ML style transfer stuff to populate missing characters from fallback fonts but maintaining the style of your primary font.
[18:11:08] <omegatron> yes, such fonts exist

[23:53:41] <fizzie> On any system where `write(1, ...)` is meaningful in the first place, chances are `setvbuf` will have no impact on it, but only affect the buffer associated with the `FILE *` stream.
