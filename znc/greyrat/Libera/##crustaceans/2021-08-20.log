[00:00:34] <mouseghost> *in fbi voice* "van is on the way"
[00:00:38] <manicennui> It's not even ambiguous. He wasn't stopping an even bigger crime.
[00:00:52] <manicennui> He just murdered people.
[00:02:25] <manicennui> There are plenty of people with similar beliefs who just live off grid.
[00:02:41] <mouseghost> yeah ive seen them in GTA 5
[00:04:26] <manicennui> I have a coworker who describes himself as a neo-luddite.
[00:04:50] <manicennui> The only behavior of his that I've noticed is that he is big on saving glass jars for reuse.
[00:05:32] <riv> haha
[00:06:06] <manicennui> The thing I like about him is that he isn't a fan of chasing tech fads.
[00:06:12] <manicennui> He also knows his shit.
[00:06:54] <mouseghost> ah yes re jars, its always weird for me to see you brag about buying reusable jars or something o;
[00:07:01] <mouseghost> you ie usans
[00:07:26] <manicennui> I don't find it weird.
[00:07:42] <manicennui> Using disposable containers is huge in the US.
[00:07:59] <mouseghost> idk. we have a lot of jars that are moved from one house to another...
[00:08:08] <mouseghost> and used for home-made things
[00:08:18] <manicennui> And he isn't just buying a bunch of jars. He likes to save them from things people buy and use.
[00:09:05] <manicennui> Most people don't save all of the jars from pickles, condiments, etc.
[00:09:08] <manicennui> In the US.
[00:09:17] <mouseghost> ye i see...
[00:19:08] <glider> We do! They all get used when the girl scouts come over and paint.
[00:24:22] <manicennui> Like you make them give your home a fresh coat?
[00:24:46] <companion_cube> I read that as "give your home a fresh goat"
[00:24:48] <companion_cube> I need sleep
[00:25:01] <manicennui> I support free goats for all.

[05:18:00] <manicennui> There is this homesteading channel that I stopped watching because the guy started going on crazy political rants.
[05:18:12] <manicennui> I came across one of their videos tonight and decided to see what they are up to.
[05:18:36] <manicennui> I noticed that a large number of their videos now have the wife half naked, or fully naked, doing stuff on their homestead.
[05:18:39] <manicennui> And far less talking.

[08:41:30] <manicennui> Vegan cheese that doesn't taste nasty?
[08:42:36] <drakonis> to be fair
[08:43:36] <bkero> I remember seeing a talk at CCC Camp many years ago about someone synthesizing milk casein from a donated human's milk to make mostly-vegan cheese that even people with lactose intolerance can eat (nobody's allergic to human milk)
[08:43:50] <drakonis> the real value here isnt vegan milk
[08:44:07] <bkero> Yeah here it is. https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/camp/2015/Fahrplan/system/attachments/2662/original/CCCamp_RVC_v2.pdf
[08:44:23] <drakonis> its that you can have milk without perpetuating the cycle required for it
[08:45:34] <drakonis> ie: breeding to get cow milk
[08:45:45] <drakonis> which will eventually require butchering
[08:45:49] <drakonis> its a horrible cycle
[08:46:21] <bkero> So is it creating casein or just a fungal structure similar to casein?

[08:51:37] <cb> is human milk ethical?
[08:51:57] <drakonis> fuck if i know
[08:51:59] <drakonis> probably not
[08:56:01] <bkero> If it's freely given?
[08:56:07] <bkero> Or cloned from a sample which is freely given?
[08:57:05] <drakonis> vegan arguments are weird honestly
[09:03:58] <manicennui> drakonis: Pfft. We'll find new fucked up things to do.
[09:04:06] <manicennui> drakonis: Assuming the Earth is habitable at all.
[09:12:53] <manicennui> The milk in the article I linked to is based on cow genetics btw.
[09:13:30] <manicennui> "Perfect Day has assembled the gene that codes for whey protein in cow's milk, and introduced it into a fungus. When the fungus is grown in fermentation tanks, it produces whey protein, which is then filtered and dried into a powder"
[09:28:45] <bkero> Whey is not casein
[09:28:47] <bkero> Whey is not cheese
[09:28:57] <bkero> Whey is a different protein than is used in cheese.
[09:29:31] <bkero> Well, there's varying degrees of whey *in* cheese, but it's not the cheese part.
[09:31:03] <manicennui> Hmm
[09:31:04] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QtG7DyU0uY
[09:33:21] <bkero> That's why they're making powders instead of hunks of cheese. This stuff could be good in making cheap protein for protein powders and "cheese"-flavored foods.
[09:33:21] <bkero> I'm sure you could blend it in a nut slurry and have a "vegan cheese spread" too

[19:24:17] <manicennui> $100k at 25 is pretty unremarkable for a software engineer in the US at this point.
[19:24:24] <manicennui> That is 3 years out of university.
[19:24:35] <manicennui> Many people get starting offers for six figures.
[19:25:00] <ben> one of my buddies got hired at amazon right out of college at like 110k
[19:27:58] <kirch> Yeah - if you have no life you can make bank as a software engineer..... you just need to convince the hiring manager you had the same high-cost education they did
[19:28:04] <manicennui> No life?
[19:28:29] <ben> i have a pretty good work-life balance at my current job
[19:28:48] <manicennui> Same.
[19:28:49] <kirch> I mean - no real obligations outside of work
[19:28:50] <ben> if i ever had to work more then 40hrs then i would just take time off the next week (salaried)
[19:28:53] <manicennui> I have never tried hard.
[19:28:58] <ben> same
[19:29:01] <manicennui> kirch: That isn't true at all.
[19:29:16] <ben> i'm a couple grand away from 6 figures
[19:29:52] <kirch> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ my experience is different.... I think using my PTO and health insurance has contributed to me being laid off... but I'm not a comp-sci/good-school guy - I'm a self-taught art-school guy...
[19:30:06] <kirch> and my art school was a scam - unaccredited...
[19:30:12] <manicennui> "Software Developers made a median salary of $107,510 in 2019. The best-paid 25 percent made $136,320 that year, while the lowest-paid 25 percent made $82,430."
[19:30:24] <manicennui> I never went to college.
[19:30:33] <ben> i'm a little below median then i guess
[19:30:38] <kirch> yeah.... not my experience... most I ever got paid was like 90k/yr
[19:30:43] <kirch> right now I'm at 75k
[19:30:57] <ben> it also heavily depends where you're at
[19:30:57] <manicennui> Are you in a major metro area?
[19:31:15] <ben> nope
[19:31:18] <kirch> Pittsburgh - it's not "major" major...
[19:31:27] <gwozniak> It took me quite a while to get to the 100K mark
[19:31:52] <manicennui> gwozniak: Yeah, but things have changed dramatically in the last few years.
[19:32:00] <dasm> ben: it all depends on where you're located.
[19:32:13] <manicennui> It doesn't entirely.
[19:32:22] <kirch> everything in Pittsburgh is either 20 years behind the times - or works with the DoD or Uber/Google
[19:33:00] <manicennui> There have been a good number of remote jobs in tech for several years now, and employers of software engineers are not just competing with other local companies.
[19:33:42] <ben> i think i'll get to 6 figures this year
[19:34:36] <dasm> i'm at 6 figures, but it doesn't change a lot. I'm paying about 20% of that for my rent.
[19:34:39] <ben> my company just announced plans to go public via SPAC
[19:34:48] <ben> 20% of income for rent is really great actually
[19:35:02] <dasm> is it? i thought it's pretty bad
[19:35:05] <manicennui> 20% gross?
[19:35:44] <dasm> before taxes. after taxes it's about 25% of what i get
[19:35:51] <dasm> yeah, i should be more clear on that
[19:35:53] <ben> dasm: are you in the US?
[19:35:57] <manicennui> I'm right at about 19% gross.
[19:35:57] <ngoldbaum> it’s not great but it’s not terrible
[19:35:59] <dasm> yes, west coast
[19:36:06] <ben> mine's far less now that i bought a house
[19:36:08] <manicennui> 20% is actually lower than average.
[19:36:12] <ben> but house projects are expensive
[19:36:20] <ngoldbaum> above 33% is when you should get worried
[19:36:26] <ben> it's a duplex so the rent from upstairs pays for a good chunk of it
[19:36:31] <dasm> so, just to give a perspective. i'm working 1.25 day every week just to cover my rent :/
[19:36:36] <dasm> that sucks, tbh
[19:36:37] <manicennui> "The most common rule of thumb to determine how much you can afford to spend on housing is that it should be no more than 30% of your gross monthly income"
[19:36:50] <gwozniak> I didn't make 100K until I got my job at IBM
[19:36:52] <manicennui> dasm: Most people have it worse.
[19:37:03] <dasm> i believe so
[19:37:07] <manicennui> gwozniak: How many years ago was that though?
[19:37:14] <gwozniak> 5
[19:37:37] <gwozniak> And it's mostly because I'm in the Toronto area
[19:37:59] <manicennui> I think I just heard the Blue Angels go over my condo.
[19:38:10] <gwozniak> And that's Canadian dollars, of course
[19:38:13] <manicennui> Ah, Canada is a bit different, but things have probably changed in 5 years.
[19:38:16] <ben> ugh those are so loud
[19:38:38] <kirch> I didn't go to CMU, so I have no klout here in Pittsburgh - where every company was incubated by CMU students or with CMU tech

[19:39:02] <gwozniak> Probably. But I don't hear much about six figure salaries from others here much
[19:39:07] <manicennui> ben: I think they were pretty high, but definitely louder than an normal plane.
[19:39:24] <manicennui> They are doing some kind of show at the lake, and I'm a few miles inland.
[19:39:43] <ben> they do a blue angels show up here every 4th of july week and it's obnoxious
[19:40:00] <gwozniak> Starting at 100K here out of school is probably not likely for software devs, but I honestly don't know
[19:40:24] <manicennui> I would guess that we start people at about $90k.
[19:40:25] <ben> taxes are high here for what we get
[19:40:39] <ben> my take home is like half of the gross
[19:40:42] <companion_cube> depends where, I guess in the bay area it's normal
[19:40:48] <companion_cube> but ofc the rents are insane there
[19:40:52] <manicennui> We probably pay our interns at least $75k.
[19:41:02] <ben> some of the people i was interviewing here started at 82-85k
[19:41:10] <ben> i started at 67 i think
[19:41:16] <manicennui> How long ago?
[19:41:19] <ben> 2017
[19:41:42] <dasm> companion_cube: "bay area is insane". that's it. no more comments.
[19:42:48] <manicennui> I'm not in the Bay area nor NYC.
[19:43:44] <gwozniak> It would not surprise me if starting salaries for new grads is typically 60-70K around here
[19:43:48] <dasm> kirch: that sucks for the US that you cannot take PTO or sick days without fear of being laid off. sorry to hear that happened to you.
[19:46:34] <manicennui> I can take PTO/sick days without any fear of being laid off.
[19:46:52] <manicennui> You have to realize that most of what you hear about is the extremes.
[19:47:02] <manicennui> And software engineers generally have it far, far better than the average person.
[19:47:54] <manicennui> But a lot of salaried office jobs are nowhere near as bad as the horror stories you hear.
[19:48:03] <manicennui> Hourly workers do get shit on.
[19:49:57] <edk> salaried people can get shit on too
[19:50:14] <manicennui> Sure.
[19:50:18] <edk> i think getting shit on is pretty much entirely a function of how replaceable you are
[19:56:36] <kirch> well.... new employer... new fears... my team lead that I've worked with for ~3 months is retiring in ~3 months
[19:57:04] <kirch> and leaving a mountain of legacy code behind.... like, some of the HTML here is obviously from the 90s
[19:57:44] <companion_cube> heirloom text markup language
[19:57:48] <kirch> lol
[19:58:49] <kirch> I think being shit on is a function of what _level_ of work you're on - whether you get to make decisions or if decisions are forced upon you.
[20:00:35] <manicennui> We treat our new hires well.
[20:01:04] <manicennui> There are a large number of Rails shops in Chicago that are very concerned about treating employees well.
[20:01:12] <manicennui> And it's not just software engineers.
[20:01:47] <manicennui> It might be partially due to the attitudes of the Ruby/Rails community.
[20:02:04] <manicennui> They have always been concerned about fair treatment of people.
[20:02:35] <kirch> yeah.... I think RoR was BIG on getting CoCs popularized
[20:02:56] <kirch> Javascript Community is pretty good on that.... Perl Community seems to be bottom-of-the-barrel on that
[20:04:14] <manicennui> We actually have some kind of lame sounding values that are actually taken seriously.
[20:04:23] <manicennui> For instance "best answer wins".
[20:04:43] <manicennui> Part of which is that people can't just throw their title around.
[20:05:02] <manicennui> We actually had a COO who tried, and people pushed back. He eventually left the company.
[20:05:21] <manicennui> Our CEO is super approachable.
[20:05:31] <manicennui> And we are a $1 billion+ revenue public company.
[20:06:00] <kirch> I had a CTO who was the only contact the Dev Team (located in Pittsburgh) had with the Company itself (HQ'd in Boston)... and he was _not_ a developer advocate in any way... lots of shit rolling down-hill
[20:06:48] <manicennui> I basically have no interaction with our acting CTO.
[20:07:05] <manicennui> We have a monthly all hands that he talks at.
[20:07:25] <manicennui> He is also the chief analytics officer, and is far more involved with analytics.
[20:07:35] <kirch> new place, the CTO is in the chatroom with everyone else... not really sure how the whole organization works yet - it's in flux because it was recently bought from the original owner/BDFL
[20:07:37] <manicennui> Our CTO left a while back and we just haven't really seen the need to replace him.
[20:08:01] <manicennui> But I've definitely talked to the CTO too.
[20:08:34] <manicennui> Our CEO reacted to one of my jokes on slack with an emoji!
[20:09:31] <kirch> I'm trying to get some folks more into reacts here - but a lot of them are connected via IRC and IDK how that works with Mattermost
[20:09:53] <manicennui> I honestly don't know how to interpret half of the emojis people use.
[20:10:38] <Brekkjern> I've played Cards Against Humanity with the second in command of the military branch I was working for :P
[20:10:52] <Brekkjern> As in, The General
[20:10:52] <kirch> yeah.... I hear-tell the cool kids now-a-days don't use emojis the same way as us old-heads..... like the :rofl: emoji marks you as old, there's some other way to rofl - I think it's a skull, IDK, I'm too old to be cool
[20:11:00] <manicennui> Okay, the Blue Angels are getting annoying.
[20:11:02] <gwozniak> When I type something in Messages and words get highlighted (presumably to replace with emojis) I often wonder why you would use an emoji for such a word
[20:11:37] <kirch> same, gwozniak
[20:11:42] <manicennui> One thing I think emojis help with is to keep conversations calm.
[20:11:50] <manicennui> It is easy to take things the wrong way in text.
[20:12:19] <manicennui> No different than adding a =P on IRC.
[20:12:24] <companion_cube> you can make custom emojis, too, in slack
[20:12:26] <companion_cube> it's kind of nice
[20:12:36] <Geekingfrog> wut, companion_cube praising slack ???
[20:12:51] <kirch> yeah.... I added pizzaspin.gif as an emoji - I take it everywhere with me
[20:12:54] <manicennui> We added emojis for all of the editors, and a few of us added them as our status emoji as a joke.
[20:13:07] <bontaq> yeah I like adding an emoji or two if I'm asking someone for something
[20:13:08] * manicennui doesn't find Slack to be horrible.
[20:14:12] <kirch> yeah - mattermost added emojis as a status... I set mine to a pic of a laptop .... but the CTO sets his as a house or an office depending on where he is
[20:14:22] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: it's the one nice feature :D
[20:14:25] <kirch> you can set your status to lunch - and it turns it into a burger emoji for 30 minutes
[20:14:43] <companion_cube> sadly it's still slow AF
[20:15:56] <kirch> I have HUGE Friday feelings today.... I wanna take a nap
[20:16:07] <ben> i want to go to the beach
[20:16:09] <manicennui> I didn't get enough sleep last night.
[20:16:20] <manicennui> I knew that drinking a Thai iced coffee with dinner was a mistake, but I did it anyways.
[20:16:33] <kline> a what
[20:17:01] <manicennui> Like a Thai iced tea, but with coffee instead.
[20:17:33] <bontaq> incredible friday energy
[20:17:39] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_tea
[20:17:39] <buttsbot> Thai tea - Wikipedia
[20:18:14] <manicennui> Basically sweetened coffee and milk over ice.
[20:18:18] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[20:18:20] <gwozniak> manicennui: oh yeah, don't get me wrong, emojis do help text conversations. But replacing plain old nouns with emojis seems like a waste of time
[20:18:40] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't do that.
[20:18:41] <kirch> ooof - I'm going into diabetic coma just thinking of that super-sweetened tea....
[20:18:54] <manicennui> I use the thumbs up more than anything to acknowledge something without commenting on it.
[20:19:06] <companion_cube> or 💯
[20:19:07] <gwozniak> I like to use thumbs up instead of "okay" because just saying "okay" can sound a bit curt
[20:19:15] <companion_cube> but yeah, it's to replace body language, no words
[20:19:19] <manicennui> gwozniak: Yeah.
[20:19:48] <companion_cube> gwozniak: o-kayyyy
[20:20:15] <bontaq> same gwozniak
[20:20:53] <gwozniak> kirch: my friday feeling is "I would like to stomp on all this tech please" so yeah, a nap feels like it is in order
[20:20:54] <manicennui> Jesus. The angels have gone by like half a dozen times now.
[20:20:58] <manicennui> Not sure why they need to fly inland.
[20:21:21] <bontaq> too bad slack doesn't doesn't track my eyeballs and add an "eyeball" emoji to every message I see
[20:21:25] <kirch> no-code fridays? try no-conciousness fridays.
[20:22:02] <companion_cube> now I'm picturing an xeyes embedded in slack
[20:22:36] <manicennui> I think I'm going to use Clojure to write some kind of tool to help me do my job.
[20:23:00] <manicennui> I'll distribute it as a docker container and trick people into using Clojure.
[20:23:23] <companion_cube> "why is this docker container so slow to start?"
[20:23:26] <companion_cube> :p
[20:23:36] <bontaq> maybe even make it a jar
[20:23:41] <bontaq> hoho they'll never know
[20:23:46] <kirch> put a docker in a jar
[20:23:46] <manicennui> bontaq: We aren't a JVM shop.
[20:23:53] <manicennui> Well, at least the part of the company I work for.
[20:24:08] <manicennui> So they would balk at running something on the JVM.
[20:24:13] <companion_cube> write it in clojurescript and ship node.js in docker
[20:24:16] <companion_cube> 🤔
[20:24:21] <manicennui> That is a possibility actually.
[20:24:26] <manicennui> I could also use babashka.
[20:24:34] <bontaq> big brain
[20:24:43] <companion_cube> I have a visceral distrust to anything based on graal
[20:25:24] <companion_cube> (👋 Geekingfrog)
[20:25:27] <kline> manicennui, that sounds super nice
[20:25:32] <kline> the iced coffee
[20:25:42] <companion_cube> it's typically super sweet though
[20:25:48] <companion_cube> you have to be american to be able to drink it :p
[20:25:51] <manicennui> kline: Do you not have Thai food there?
[20:25:58] <companion_cube> (based on my sample size of 1)
[20:26:00] <kline> in rural england? no
[20:26:03] <manicennui> companion_cube: It's a real thing in Thailand though.
[20:26:09] <manicennui> Not sure whether they make it less sweet.
[20:26:13] <companion_cube> good question
[20:26:26] <companion_cube> but I'd imagine cheap sugar is more recent in Thailand? like in Japan
[20:26:53] <kirch> I think they use condensed milk instead of sugar + milk
[20:28:11] <kline> does that thicken the coffee?
[20:28:28] <kline> id rather mine be slightly more viscous when cold

[20:38:08] <buttsbot> FuIIofDETERMINATION comments on Official Discussion - The Green Knight [SPOILERS]
[20:38:17] <manicennui> Really great analysis of The Green Knight.
[20:38:36] <manicennui> I came away from the movie with mixed feelings and being pretty underwhelmed.
[20:38:49] <manicennui> But now I want to read some of the stories and watch it again.
[20:41:25] <kirch>  Sir Gawain and the Green Knight = spoilers
[20:41:51] <kirch> it's good to have other Arthurian legends outside the big one being put on film
[20:43:44] <manicennui> The problem is that I didn't have this person's knowledge.
[20:43:51] <manicennui> So it mostly seemed like a bunch of random things.
[20:43:56] <manicennui> Some of which looked cool.
[20:44:30] <manicennui> There were a couple of small details that I kind of figured out, but I missed far more.
[20:44:55] <manicennui> I'm also not great at analysis of fiction in general.
[20:45:25] <manicennui> In hindsight this stuff seems more obvious.
[20:45:25] <manicennui> I'm also not well read.
[20:45:46] <kirch> the problem with these old stories is that we don't usually get full cultural context with them... like, we don't get their memes
[20:46:05] <manicennui> Definitely.
[20:46:17] <kirch> it's like how people think Shakespeare is high-brow... he absolutely was not
[20:46:41] <companion_cube> ohhhhhhhhhhh
[20:46:45] <manicennui> It's the flowery language.
[20:46:50] <companion_cube> is it time to get hyped for a language
[20:46:55] <manicennui> ?
[20:46:58] <companion_cube> that used to not be hypable
[20:47:05] <companion_cube> the answer is yes: https://dlang.org/phobos/std_sumtype.html
[20:47:06] <manicennui> ???
[20:47:06] <buttsbot> std.sumtype - D Programming Language
[20:47:10] <companion_cube> (sorry)
[20:47:19] <companion_cube> so D has sum types now
[20:47:26] <manicennui> Hasn't D always been a better C++ though?
[20:47:52] <companion_cube> yes, but not better enough that it had sumtypes :s
[20:50:37] <companion_cube> quite impressive that they can do it entirely in userland with templates
[20:51:00] <manicennui> As opposed to?
[20:51:26] <companion_cube> have some language support for them
[20:51:39] <companion_cube> (as is normally the case)
[20:51:53] <manicennui> When someone says userland the opposite for me is the kernel.
[20:52:01] <manicennui> I get it now.
[20:52:07] <companion_cube> for a language I'd say userland vs compiler :)
[20:52:13] <companion_cube> otherwise, I agree
[20:52:34] <manicennui> Well, a compiler can support something that the language does not.
[20:52:53] <manicennui> For instance generics in several languages are not part of the language per se.
[20:53:18] <manicennui> Rather, they are not part of the generated code.
[20:55:27] <companion_cube> for me, "part of the language" means that the compiler knows about it
[20:56:24] <manicennui> How much of your average lisp is "part of the language"?
[20:58:29] <kline>  kirch | it's like how people think Shakespeare is high-brow... he absolutely was not
[20:58:41] <kline> he made jokes about cunts and its taught to schoolkids
[20:58:45] <kline> whats highbrow about it?

[20:59:15] <buttsbot> Cox–Zucker machine - Wikipedia
[20:59:36] <manicennui> kline: I really think it's the language that people aren't familiar with, and the fact that it is poetry.
[21:00:29] <manicennui> Anything more difficult than Harry Potter is "high brow".
[21:07:40] <edk> shakespeare is high brow *now* because it's old
[21:08:03] <edk> there must be classical literature that was popular when it was new, too
[21:10:07] * manicennui imagines Twilight becoming some kind of literary classics in 100 years.
[21:10:23] <edk> probably not
[21:11:13] <companion_cube> manicennui: lisp is known to have very little as part of the language, yes
[21:11:16] <edk> shakespeare was popular for a reason
[21:11:27] <companion_cube> otoh lisp isn't a low level statically typed language 🤷
[21:11:37] <manicennui> Thank god.
[21:11:48] <companion_cube> sure, but to have that in D/Zig/nim is quite cool
[21:11:48] <edk> all languages should be statically typed

[21:19:03] <manicennui> And they went over about 10 times.
[21:19:54] <manicennui> Related to The Green Knight, I could listen to Ralph Ineson talk forever.
[21:20:01] <manicennui> I wonder whether he has done any audio books.
[21:20:10] <ngoldbaum> chicago air show?
[21:20:39] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: Just the Angels AFAIK.
[21:21:01] <manicennui> Oh, I guess it is the Air and Water Show.
[21:21:01] <manicennui> https://abc7chicago.com/blue-angels-chicago-2021-air-and-water-show-schedule-practice/10956904/
[21:21:25] <manicennui> "The demonstration is taking place in lieu of the normal Chicago Air and Water Show."
[21:21:28] <manicennui> Oh, so I was right.
[21:21:49] <manicennui> I really hate that we masturbate over the military so much.
[21:22:10] <manicennui> "The mission of the Blue Angels is to showcase the teamwork and professionalism of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps through flight demonstrations and community outreach while inspiring a culture of excellence and service to country, the release said."
[21:22:32] <manicennui> Yay team! Kill those innocent people!
[21:23:41] <ngoldbaum> yeah it’s part of the navy’s recruitment budget
[21:24:02] <ngoldbaum> i happened to catch the air force’s flight demonstration team at the academy commencement a few months ago
[21:24:43] <ngoldbaum> driving on an interstate while a bunch of f-16s are doing precision flight stuff over you is extremely distracting
[21:26:19] <manicennui> Maybe sometime in my lifetime we will finally admit that there is nothing honorable about serving in the military and our military has almost nothing to do with defending anything.
[21:26:38] <manicennui> The Coast Guard does more to protect us than most of the military.

[21:40:50] <HankHill> Lol

[21:42:07] <manicennui> There has to be a better way to do this.
[22:02:47] <gwozniak> Wee. I now get to use a simulator in a Docker container that uses a network license, so DNS issues are sure to be on the menu
[22:03:04] <gwozniak> I fucking hate that we're all devops now
[22:03:27] <bkero> Be mad they didn't give you a basic-ass flat network.
[22:03:32] <bkero> With real DNS
[22:04:08] <gwozniak> Also, can't tell if it's working or not, which is just stellar
[22:06:05] <bkero> No problem, just launch a sidecar and hope it has similar networking.
[22:06:49] <ngoldbaum> i hate how everyone needs to know how to do networking on linux at a really deep level because of docker’s fuckyness
[22:07:25] <gwozniak> yeah, that's the shit that I really hate
[22:07:29] <bkero> The alternative is to do a bunch of dumb SDN.
[22:07:39] <gwozniak> nice abstraction we've done there
[22:07:41] <bkero> and then you have even less introspection when things break
[22:13:27] <HankHill> ngoldbaum: I mean eh, most you need to know are some iptables rules really
[22:14:08] * ngoldbaum doesn’t know shit about iptables
[22:14:22] <ngoldbaum> but i do sometimes need to write tests that talk to a network service
[22:14:44] <ngoldbaum> although that said i do try to avoid writing tests that need a working internet connection if i can avoid it
[22:14:57] <ngoldbaum> otoh mocks are bad
[22:20:47] <manicennui> I have a hard time seeing how docker helps in development in most cases.
[22:21:25] <companion_cube> you can k8s your dockers so that the PKI increase post A/B test
[22:21:26] <companion_cube> duh
[22:21:33] <manicennui> I get wanting a reproducible setup, but my coworkers who try to use the docker configs that people wrote have *way* more problems than I do.
[22:21:42] <manicennui> I just run shit.
[22:22:05] <manicennui> I kind of feel like half of the problem is that people have no idea what they are doing and just want to type a command.
[22:22:12] <manicennui> But when that command fails, they have no ability to troubleshoot.
[22:22:48] <manicennui> So the complicated thing they are using to try to avoid knowing things just adds complicated problems of its own.
[22:23:26] <gwozniak> So I *think* the problem is the simulator can't access the license server

[23:08:15] <gwozniak> It was so much fun spending two days trying to get a build with testing happening...
[23:08:25] <ngoldbaum> playing quake with a gamepad tho
[23:08:32] <gwozniak> Seems wrong
[23:08:38] <ngoldbaum> can you plug a mouse and keyboard into a ps5?
[23:08:43] <ngoldbaum> or a switch?
[23:08:51] <ngoldbaum> probably not a switch
[23:08:53] <gwozniak> Quake was one of the last games I played, tbh
[23:09:53] <gwozniak> And that was when it came out
[23:10:25] <manicennui> I think I'm weeks or months away from never playing games again.
[23:10:35] <manicennui> All I play is Overwatch, and it irritates me as much as it entertains me.
[23:13:19] <gwozniak> Diablo was the last game I played, back in 1997
[23:14:02] <manicennui> So you lied a moment ago.
[23:14:09] * manicennui shakes his head.
[23:14:40] <gwozniak> I've played a few other things here and there, but just when some of us were together and killing time.  I bought Neverwinter Nights ages ago but I think I played it once
[23:14:43] <companion_cube> > one of
[23:14:46] <companion_cube> ;)
[23:15:16] <manicennui> The problem with games for me is that they are more addictive than fun, and everything about them is ephemeral.
[23:15:25] <gwozniak> I also tried out Plants vs. Zombies when it came out for the iPhone, but that didn't last
[23:15:57] <manicennui> I basically never think back to some moment in a video game. I certainly haven't learned anything from a video game.
[23:16:18] <gwozniak> Diablo taught me that they are addictive and I should avoid them
[23:16:21] <manicennui> The best stories in video games tend to be worse than bad novels.
[23:16:44] <manicennui> I actually think open world games are worse.
[23:16:51] <companion_cube> what about games that are actually from books? :p
[23:17:01] <companion_cube> (like, tom clancy inspired games)
[23:17:05] <manicennui> I'm not sure that I've played one.
[23:17:17] <manicennui> I also haven't read a Tom Clancy novel.
[23:17:24] <companion_cube> :D
[23:18:25] <companion_cube> me neither, tbh
[23:18:28] <manicennui> Actually, one game I think had a decent story was Full Throttle.
[23:18:30] <companion_cube> but I played some splinter cells in the past
[23:18:55] <manicennui> But it was one of those point and click adventure games with very linear gameplay.
[23:19:00] <manicennui> Basically an interactive story.

[23:19:27] <buttsbot> Full Throttle Remastered - Full Intro Video - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf9xqsmO9m4
[23:23:00] <manicennui> I know that there are narrative games now, but this genre was pretty popular and well done back then.
[23:23:32] <manicennui> Including more "adult" games like Leisure Suit Larry.
[23:24:27] <manicennui> Space Quest.
[23:24:35] <bkero> Mmm Full Throttle.
[23:24:39] <bkero> That is a good game.
[23:24:43] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphic_adventure_games
[23:24:44] <buttsbot> List of graphic adventure games - Wikipedia
[23:33:35] <manicennui> A lot of the recent point-and-click adventure games have terrible 3d graphics.
[23:33:57] <bkero> There are some delightful throwbacks as well

[23:34:45] <buttsbot> Baobabs Mausoleum Ep.1: Ovnifagos Don´t Eat Flamingos on Steam
[23:35:03] <manicennui> Deponia looks decent.
[23:35:34] <manicennui> bkero: Looks cool.
[23:35:40] <bkero> That one's good too
[23:36:43] <manicennui> Oxenfree looks decent too.
[23:37:11] <bkero> and Afterparty
[23:37:16] <bkero> (same studio as Oxenfree)
[23:38:17] <manicennui> That does look good.
[23:40:08] <bkero> When else are you going to out-party Satan?
