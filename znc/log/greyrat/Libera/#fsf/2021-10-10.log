[00:00:03] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], there is a better free software implementation: not using CAPTCHAs at all
[00:00:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> people get really confused when they see my card with:

[00:00:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> * `Tel: matrix://kreyren@tchncs.de`
[00:00:41] <tpefreedom> M6piz7wk[m], Isn't freedom more important than convenience (at least when you have something functional in both categories)?
[00:00:45] <Noisytoot> If someone wants to integrate reCAPTCHA, they can, but it shouldn't be supported officially or in the spec
[00:00:59] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], What's wrong with OMEMO?
[00:01:04] *** Quits: xx (~xx@user/xx) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)

[00:02:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's not O.o by having more proprietary that way we get more FLOSS and proprietary changing on FLOSS
[00:02:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> i agree that ain't a case for US
[00:02:20] <M6piz7wk[m]> yes
[00:02:22] <echoSMILE> the card address
[00:03:33] <echoSMILE> the address of future for everyone for any comunication would be like:
[00:03:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> Europeans are just more aligned with FLOSS culturarely to passively transition on FLOSS imho

[00:05:39] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], What do you mean by <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: it has XMPP and IRC?
[00:05:57] <riv> too lazy to code my app
[00:06:04] <Noisytoot> and how does Matrix have better encryption than XMPP?
[00:06:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: i am on matrix and i talk with you on IRC from it.. it also supports XMPP
[00:06:15] <riv> matrix encryption is awful
[00:06:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> riv: nah
[00:06:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> you just need to verify sessions
[00:06:43] <riv> thats the part that annoys me
[00:07:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> or like even imagine US government making grants for FLOSS projects like protonmail.com
[00:07:34] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], The Matrix-IRC bridge is terrible. It's slow and crashes on netsplits. The Matrix-XMPP bridge is also terrible, it doesn't relay joins/parts. biboumi (an XMPP-IRC bridge) works much better

[00:09:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> well depends on who set up that bridge since matrix has standard for pupet users 
[00:09:16] <noisytoot[x]> biboumi also has puppet users

[00:27:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> also the article on the wiki seems misquoted as that is not what the references say.. it even references the page of Yi Seok https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Seok
[00:27:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> i do agree that it doesn't seems to be like UK monarchy.. more like people who have power to influence the law instead of dictate it atm
[00:27:25] <Armand> There is no monarchy, so it cannot be "like" a monarchy.
[00:27:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> weak god~

[00:28:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> doubt
[00:28:34] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], "pretender" means he would be crown prince if the Joseon Empire still existed, but it doesn't
[00:29:13] <Armand> Like I said.. Liar.
[00:29:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> the joseon empire is split in north and south korea.. it doesn't always mean that the royalty dies with the nation

[00:29:27] <Armand> Wrong.
[00:29:29] <Armand> Incorrect.
[00:29:31] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], It hasn't existed since 1897
[00:29:31] <Armand> Invalid.
[00:30:12] <M6piz7wk[m]> and Yi Seok has well documented blood line and family to claim himself head of House IY last time i checked
[00:30:14] <Armand> Hold up a sec.. I'm just going to file my "Crown Prince" paperwork for the USA.
[00:30:35] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], but the Joseon Empire doesn't even exist any more
[00:30:36] <Noisytoot> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Korea
[00:30:40] <Armand> M6piz7wk[m]: Still irrelevant, as there is no throne and no monarchy.
[00:30:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: Do you have a 700 year long record that proves that you are of the blood line and you can prove it?  :p
[00:31:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: there can be throne even when the state is not under control of the clan
[00:31:12] <Armand> M6piz7wk[m]: Actually, my traceable family history goes back further.
[00:31:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> e.g. japanese do that a lot
[00:31:26] <Armand> .. just not relevant to any title. :P
[00:31:45] <Armand> M6piz7wk[m]: But.. There IS NO throne and NO monarchy.
[00:31:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: Then good luck with your arbitration my lord
[00:31:51] <Armand> That which does not exist does not exist.
[00:32:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> in asian culture there are families that have power to influence the government such as House of IY
[00:33:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> and their members might prefer to be in the US such as what UK royalty does now
[00:33:17] <Armand> Except that's not relevant to the matter.
[00:33:24] <noisytoot[m]> THe House of IY doesn't even exist any more
[00:33:29] <Armand> In fact, totally irrelevant.
[00:33:33] <noisytoot[m]> So it's not relevant
[00:33:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> well there are royal families in the EU like i am from one.. 
[00:33:51] <Armand> Pears are a fruit, therefore the sky doesn't exist.
[00:34:01] <Armand> See how relevant those two points are.. ?
[00:34:17] <noisytoot[m]> I am probably related to some royal family in some way, it doesn't mean I get to be the crown prince of anywhere
[00:34:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's not "some way".. you have to be at least 90% related
[00:34:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> well in most juridistictiosn
[00:34:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> sometimes even 30 %

[05:57:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> how do you even establish economy for a startup FLOSS project that is for-profit
[06:04:58] <fossdev> Matrix is trying to solve the problem that no one wants
[06:07:08] <fossdev> Every protocol should have their specific client and not there should not be any bridge 
[06:10:08] <fossdev> Because every protocol has their own specification to communicate with each other and bridging two protocol is very insecure.
[06:10:59] <Noisytoot> This IRC channel isn't end-to-end encrypted anyway
[06:11:06] <Noisytoot> So it's not any more insecure
[06:12:35] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.228.11)
[06:14:30] <fossdev> Noisytoot: Ooh, this is why I don't use Matrix at all.
[06:16:38] <fossdev> Also Matrix is vey less decentralized than XMPP because I forces people to use their matrix server and element.

[06:35:56] <fossdev> I suggest Tox for realtime communication and XMPP for offline communication.
[06:39:11] <fossdev> Tox is p2p e2ee messaging protocol which is written in C. It is much faster due to its p2p nature.
[06:41:11] <fossdev> Keep in mind that Tox audio video and groupchat features are experimental.
[06:41:21] <LohanG> last time I checked, Matrix (element) web client and Element had links to sign in with Facebook, Google and Apple accounts
[06:42:07] <fossdev> LohanG: Yes, Matrix also promote non free services 
[06:42:15] <LohanG> it is really difficult to recommend it for those who seek free software alternatives
[06:43:54] <fossdev> Matrix also have bridges various non free protocols like Whatsapp
[06:44:04] <LohanG> wow, really?
[06:45:19] <LohanG> I didn't know that. Then people will easily choose convenience over freedom. Less likely to take further steps to achieve more freedom.
[06:45:38] <LohanG> Not a good entry point
[06:46:47] <fossdev> LohanG: This is why they getting famous.
[06:47:44] <LohanG> on the other hand https://delta.chat seems like a reasonable and straightforward solution. It is IM via email. If both parties have delta client they can use encryption. Alternatively you can use conventional email encryption methods too. If non of it is available, it works like email.
[06:48:33] <LohanG> And it'd free software
[06:53:24] <fossdev> LohanG: It looks promising but emails are not instant messaging.
[06:53:43] <fossdev> Emails are slower.
[06:54:05] <LohanG> hmm, true
[06:55:24] <fossdev> LohanG: And what about voice and video chat.
[06:56:00] <LohanG> ah, yes. You can't do that with delta :)

[13:40:00] <kompowiec> I made a mistake and bought a ThinkPad T42 .. I don't know what to do with it ugh.
[13:41:42] <GNUmer> kompowiec: Does it have Libreboot, Osboot or Coreboot compatibility? If it doesn't Thinkpads still are great machines with excellent build quality and impressive upgradeability.
[13:42:16] <kompowiec> everything works in it, only CMOS has run out.
