[03:14:12] <horribleprogram> Is there a formal term for the relationship of two functions, g(x) and f(x), such that g(f(x)) is 1
[03:14:20] <horribleprogram> Ik inverse functions
[03:14:25] <horribleprogram> g(f(x)) = x
[03:14:41] <horribleprogram> but the relationship between sin and csc for example
[03:14:55] <horribleprogram> is not really an inverse but it's an inverse in the term of quotients...
[03:15:08] <horribleprogram> well real numbers in general.... inverse of x is 1/x
[03:15:15] <buster> reciprocal
[03:15:17] <horribleprogram> so the inverse of x is a number such that x * it = 1

[03:16:10] <horribleprogram> and then u have negative as well... I guess
[03:16:22] <horribleprogram> such that f(x) + g(x) = 0
[03:16:39] <horribleprogram> sorry minus?
[03:16:53] <horribleprogram> no wait yes, f(x) = -g(x) so f(x) + g(x) = 0

[07:48:42] <Matt|home> "this statement is false" <-- english statements do not equate to contradictions in reality. i could say "purple exfolization zoidberg" and it wouldn't have any weight or meaning behind a statement being true or false
[07:49:01] <Matt|home> in computing terms, just to give you an example, you could not do 1 = 2
[07:50:16] <Matt|home> if that made any goddamn sense
[07:52:11] <econo> do you have a set of rules that can help us get rid of "paradoxes" that aren't ad hoc and don't refer to the concept of a paradox?
[07:52:32] <brownorange> "this statement is false"  cannot be evaluated because it references its evaluation as part of its content you must evaluate.
[07:53:47] <brownorange> so it's false, but is only true by technicality. like someone being able to explain everything by being wrong
[07:55:24] <Matt|home> i dunno i feel like that's overcomplicating matters :p

Now if you assume the undecidable is implied by the arithmetic, then by modus ponens there's a proof Arithmetic implies that Undecidable. More importantly if the undecidable is also a given, then by converse of the deduction theorem, that undecidable is actually therefore provable from Arithmetic.
[08:22:16] <brownorange> To claim Arithmetic implies any undecidables but somehow does not prove them is wrong in the case where both are literally assumed.

[10:16:34] <Matt|home> right. so basically you're screwed charlie in that case i assume
[10:17:27] <moon-child> HisShadow: this goes back to the wikipedia link I posted.  Any answer will make certain assumptions, and all assumptions are invalid
[10:17:53] <moon-child> however, performing such experiments may still tell you something about your environment.  They're not meaningless unless you deny meaning entirely

[14:17:50] <lericson> you have 100 points in some metric space, now you want to find the 10 points with the largest distance to each other. is there a better way than to just try all 100!/90! possibilities?
[14:18:08] <lericson> clearly there must be since the distance is symmetric but it eludes me
[14:19:02] <lericson> (100!/90! ≈ 1e19 so...)
[14:19:30] <HisShadow> maybe finding convex hull might help, although if it's some general metric space that might not be possible
[14:19:39] <lericson> it's 2D
[14:19:44] <int-e> lericson: 10 points define 45 distances... given two sets of 10 points each, how exactly do you determine which one is better?
[14:19:45] <lericson> euclidean
[14:20:42] <lericson> int-e: sum (for each of the 10 points, sum the distance to the other 9 points)
[14:21:41] <lericson> i guess i could just start with a random point and greedily take the point furthest away, then the point furthest away to those two points, etc.
[14:21:55] <lericson> it only needs to be ≈ correct
[14:23:17] <int-e> You can disregard order... C(100,90) ~ 2e13 is still uncomfortably large for stupid brute force.
[14:26:25] <HisShadow> a few days/weeks maybe
[14:27:08] <lericson> now increase by 1 :p
[14:27:38] <int-e> why? just decrease instead... :P
[14:27:53] <lericson> ah but of course!
[14:28:04] <int-e> Or maybe keep the number of points and increase the size of the clique to 100
[14:29:02] <int-e> anyway, nothing smart comes to mind... I'd try hill-climbing (replacing a point at a time), with restarts, then see if simulated annealing improves things?

[14:34:31] <rubiksdream> i.e. you cant find two subsequences in either closed sets

[20:33:31] <oj> quarterback: then you should regularly test yourself on problems from every chapter you've already read
[20:33:32] <quarterback> oj, Good idea to refresh math.
[20:33:45] <mra90> the later one is by dividing aveything by 'e' after taking the quadratic
[20:34:32] <oj> quarterback: I don't know exactly what an optimal schedule is, but I try to keep at least the concept of spaced repetition in mind when studying
[20:34:53] <quarterback> oj, Spaced repetition works fine.
[20:34:55] <oj> so that I don't get too stuck on the details
[20:35:37] <oj> But another thing to keep in mind is that you can only study for about a half hour before your brain starts getting dull
[20:35:54] <oj> so take a break when you notice you're losing your focus
[20:36:12] <oj> then come back in 15 minutes and try again
[20:36:23] <quarterback> The content in this math book is kind of thoughtful. I think I can only take it like half hour to one hour everyday.
[20:36:35] <oj> that's also fine
[20:36:46] <oj> I think the biggest thing is simply not to try to cram too fast
[20:36:56] <quarterback> losing focus is not a problem because I work out problems on paper
[20:37:02] <oj> then you might think you've learned something, while you actually haven't
[20:37:27] <quarterback> speed during learning kills learning.
[20:37:45] <Z-module> mra90, you did not express e purely in terms of s and x there.  If you're really solving for e (are you sure about that? not solving for x ?), you rearrange everything after expanding:  s = e^2 + 2xe + x^2   or   e^2 + 2xe + (x^2 - s) = 0   and now you can use the quadratic formula.
[20:37:49] <oj> productivity kill creativity ;)
[20:38:06] <quarterback> But I have lot of distractions like neighbors speaking or shouting loudly or loud tv of music around me.

[20:38:52] <oj> quarterback: yeah, that could be bad
[20:39:09] <oj> finding a quiet space is important
[20:39:24] <quarterback> Never heard of that. I think some people told me leisure with complete withdrawal from studies would refresh our brains.

[23:19:39] <zincy__> Thanks!

[23:22:34] <zincy__> Also is it sufficient to sat that for an interval [a,b] in the reals there are are infinite number of points in the interval because the rationals are dense in the reals?

[23:23:27] <Z-module> density isn't even needed
[23:23:35] <rubiksdream> yeah
[23:23:57] <Z-module> or forget rationals. Just list infinitely many distinct points in there:   a + (b - a)/2,  a + (b - a)/3,  a + (b - a)/4, ....

[23:58:08] <biberao> rex_victor: its third quadrant
[23:58:38] <biberao> rex_victor: for positive right
[23:58:39] <rex_victor> rubiksdream: but how do you define degrees in the first place?
[23:58:43] <biberao> if wanted clockwise "-pi"?
[23:59:02] <rubiksdream> rex_victor yeah sure, it is going to be radians first
[23:59:26] <rubiksdream> because you can point out what a radian is using nothing but arc length
[23:59:35] <rubiksdream> i agree its more natural
