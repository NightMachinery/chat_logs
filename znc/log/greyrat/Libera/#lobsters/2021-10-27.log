[00:02:30] <rb> "P p"
[00:02:32] <rb> pfff
[00:02:33] <c355E3B> if a tensor processing unit can do math for ML, can I make it do math for other things?
[00:03:40] <rb> (unrelated, but still funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHcHMoFj98o)

[00:04:00] <shapr> c355E3B: yes
[00:04:24] <c355E3B> but how?
[00:04:27] <c355E3B> that is the real question
[00:04:36] <c355E3B> there is *zero* documentation on how to talk to the thing
[00:05:15] <shapr> c355E3B: for groq, it's a low latency high throughput matrix multiplier
[00:05:26] <c355E3B> oh neat
[00:05:41] <shapr> I forget the size, 1536x1536 or something?
[00:05:47] <shapr> I can dig up the details if you want
[00:05:53] <shapr> I know some people working there
[00:06:11] <shapr> also, groq was started by the TPU team
[00:06:34] <c355E3B> cool
[00:06:41] <c355E3B> Alas they don't have hardware pricing
[00:06:58] <shapr> expensive
[00:06:59] <ngoldbaum> c355E3B: can your problem be reduced to matrix math with half-precision floats?
[00:07:08] <ngoldbaum> then yes
[00:07:12] <ngoldbaum> otherwise no
[00:07:31] <shapr> happily for me, I have some problems that are exactly that
[00:07:31] <dimino> weirdly specific question, but does this sound familiar to anyone? "Corporate VPNs are sometimes added to block lists because they're often used to bypass geofencing"?
[00:07:37] <c355E3B> I have tons of roaring bitmaps to churn through
[00:07:41] <c355E3B> dimino: yes
[00:08:07] <dimino> hm ok, is there like, anything I can read about this?
[00:08:33] <c355E3B> No clue on that point, I'm just used to being an SRE and dealing with it

[00:09:15] <dimino> yeah I'm trying to learn about it because we had to allowlist a customer explicitly because their IP was on one of the AWS provided reputation lists
[00:09:32] <dimino> thinking maybe we just don't use that list or something
[00:10:09] <kline> rb, is magit F u for fetch or pull upstream?
[00:10:36] <c355E3B> dimino: for WAF?
[00:10:55] <dimino> yeah
[00:11:06] <rb> kline: fetch is f
[00:11:08] <c355E3B> Oh this isn't a VPN issue then
[00:11:08] <rb> pull is F
[00:11:17] <kline> reasonable hotkey choices
[00:11:21] <c355E3B> Your customer has a middlebox which is mangling the outgoing http connections
[00:11:26] <rb> presumably because P is taken for push
[00:11:36] <rb> p is uh
[00:11:38] <kline> p/P for push/Pull would be cool
[00:11:38] <c355E3B> and WAF is flagging it because it looks like a virus is trying to direct traffic to your site
[00:11:38] <rb> not actually taken
[00:11:43] <rb> wth magit
[00:11:52] <dimino> oh weird
[00:12:00] <kline> f/F for fetch/pull also makes sense

[06:14:12] <pushcx> ok, chown done
[06:14:53] <Pronoiac> Possibly dumb questions: why not blow away the cache? How long does it last, anyway?
[06:17:42] <pushcx> a day or so
[06:18:39] <pushcx> I thought about doing a quick 'mv tmp/cache ~' to mvoe it out of the way, but I had high confidence chown would work in a couple minutes and don't know how unhappy parts of the codebase like Rack::Attack might be at having the cache pulled out from under the running app process.
[06:21:18] <Pronoiac> When not logged in, cache-control for the home page is max-age=0; I'm sure internals are different
[06:22:12] <Pronoiac> And yup, I'd rather not find out how it reacts to pulling that out either.
[06:24:47] <pushcx> Yeah. The page is cached for sixty seconds, IIRC. And I'm not sure offhand but the query is probably caches as well.

[13:02:38] <Aviolet> If you have a look on our blogposts, you can see this is very technical. We do not have any corporate strategy, just wanna share on our technical subjects.
[13:03:49] <Aviolet> Also, sometimes we publish articles on personal blogs, such as this one for example (from one of the creators of Docker) : https://jpetazzo.github.io/

[13:25:03] <kline> Aviolet, are you coming here as an individual for personal reasons or as a company representative?
[13:27:50] <Aviolet> both. I am doing a lot of technical survey on our devops & cloud native domains. And when I can share what I found very relevant I am sharing.

[14:26:59] <amazigh> deadk: the problem is that while we do not discuss among us about the long now practice of programming, other clueless persons do. It is not technology such as library, tool, software or hardware, it is a soft skill, it is part of my job.
[14:28:15] <amazigh> I underline it does not enter the categories of "rant" or "political" or "marketing"
[14:29:13] <deadk> talking to people is also part of my job, but i don't think that makes it related to technology
[14:30:02] <deadk> like i wouldn't want to see an article on lobste.rs about how to ask people on slack to get to the point when they start a conversation with "hi" "good morning" "how are you"
[14:30:51] <deadk> i also confess that i think musings on the nature of "seniors" is a question that is asked far less than it's answered
[14:32:12] <amazigh> looking at https://lobste.rs/t/practices it seems it the junior-senior-mentor is a good candidate

[14:32:53] <amazigh> deadk: what do you mean by "answered". The article states that a senior without a junior to be teached can not be a senior, that is an answer.
[14:33:15] <deadk> yeah, it's an answer to a question no-one was asking
[14:33:29] <deadk> if this specific article adss something new to the body of thought about the definition of "senior" it's lost on me
[14:33:35] <deadk> or adds
[14:34:28] <amazigh> your argument is: that is old knowledge / news?
[14:39:02] <deadk> i guess there are several. i don't think it's about technology, i think it's a very common take on the subject it is about, and i think opinions on that subject are largely irrelevant to almost everyone
[14:39:38] <deadk> "senior" is just a word; it doesn't have one canonical meaning and it doesn't need to

[19:10:18] *** Joins: loc (~loc@174-045-102-241.res.spectrum.com)
[19:10:47] <drobilla> Loosely speaking, the former checks out a local branch, the latter a remote one (without creating a local one and then tracking it)
[19:11:25] <riv> so
[19:11:40] <riv> git branches exist on machines
[19:11:50] <drobilla> So you'll be detached if you check out origin/BRANCH
[19:12:29] <ngoldbaum> riv: git branches are refs, pointers to commits
[19:12:33] <riv> ok that actually falls into place, ty
[19:12:35] <ngoldbaum> those refs can be entirely local
[19:12:37] <drobilla> mmmm... sorta?  branches aren't really, uh, things
[19:12:44] <ngoldbaum> you also get remote refs when you pull from a repo
[19:12:47] <riv> okay maybe i just thought i understood it :P
[19:13:09] <ngoldbaum> so you can say this remote repo’s foo branch is at x commit, but my foo commit is at y commit
[19:13:10] <riv> hmm
[19:13:21] <ngoldbaum> and meaningfully distinguish between the two with that shorthand
[19:13:22] <riv> so i can have a ref to a commit that is on github.com
[19:13:26] <ngoldbaum> yes
[19:13:31] <riv> but somehow i can actually look at this on my own machine
[19:13:44] <ngoldbaum> well, the state of the remote repo the last time you pulled
[19:13:48] <riv> but not edit it, because i can only edit (be in a non detatched head state) commits that im referencing locally
[19:13:50] <riv> for some reason
[19:13:59] <riv> ah
[19:14:01] <riv> i see
[19:14:25] <drobilla> A "remote" can even be another repo on the same machine (I do that sometimes)

[19:14:45] *** Joins: southclaws_ (~quassel@212.82.81.237)
[19:14:47] <riv> that's interesting, what do you do that for?
[19:14:59] <riv> i've had multiple remotes once I think, to push my code to github, gitlab, etc.
[19:15:03] <ngoldbaum> sometimes it’s simpler to make a local clone for complicated stuff
[19:15:14] <ngoldbaum> or like you can push to a network share, for example
[19:15:20] <drobilla> I use it when I have a "canonical" main checkout, but also another one somewhere within another project.  So if I change the "copy" one, I push to the local "main" one to sort things out before really pushing remotely
[19:15:37] <riv> wow thats smart ty!
[19:15:46] <riv> i was kind of doing this, but I actually cloned my entire dev VM :PO
[19:15:58] <riv> which worked but this is a lighter weight solution
[19:16:13] <cb_> half the time i want to checkout a remote branch and work on it, half the time i wanna just check something out from it
[19:16:23] <drobilla> Yeah, when you have a lot of stuff around it starts getting pretty handy to realize you can push and pull to whatever you want, and a network doesn't need to be involved
[19:16:26] <ngoldbaum> riv: play through https://learngitbranching.js.org it goes through all this and the graph visualization helps you more easily understand the dag operations you’re doing in the git UI
[19:16:26] <mockturtle> [ Learn Git Branching ] - learngitbranching.js.org
[19:16:27] <cb_> git's not really clear on both but i suspect making a local ver of the branch is easier

[19:18:15] <mockturtle> [ Git for Computer Scientists ] - eagain.net
[19:18:19] <riv> does this basically point that branch to this new commit?
[19:18:31] <ngoldbaum> if you have the branch checked out, yes
[19:18:42] <ngoldbaum> if no then you’re in detached HEAD state
[19:18:55] <ngoldbaum> (no refs are pointing at the commit you have checked out)
[19:19:02] <riv> so when i push it's pushing the commits and it's also telling the git repo what commit my branch points to
[19:19:10] <ngoldbaum> checking out a branch makes git move the ref every time you make a commit
[19:19:15] <riv> aha!
