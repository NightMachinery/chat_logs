[00:05:36] <emmeka> Llamamoe congrats!
[00:05:45] <emmeka> Llamamoe what'll you be interviewing for?
[00:05:55] <MootPoot> pizza delivery man :P
[00:06:18] <MootPoot> with a video camera and a foot long dong
[00:06:42] <Llamamoe> emmeka: Talking with people in English over video chat, basically. 
[00:06:57] <Llamamoe> With relatively minimal lesson plans for what to talk about 
[00:07:07] <emmeka> ah, ESL tutor?
[00:07:17] <Llamamoe> I also get to just log on whenever I want and wait for people to connect, and that's it 
[00:07:18] <Llamamoe> yeah 
[00:07:25] <emmeka> your English is excellent, I think you'll get it
[00:07:34] <Sxem> i want that job
[00:07:44] <MootPoot> Llamamoe: good job on getting the interview
[00:07:55] <MootPoot> thats like 80% of the way there
[00:08:01] <Llamamoe> I'm way better at written than spoken English, but it still be fully within my competences 
[00:08:09] <Llamamoe> but it still should be* agh
[00:08:22] <Cryowolf> aaah making bolognese...a bit late, 21:38...but it expires today
[00:08:28] <emmeka> Sxem I'm sure you could get a remote ESL tutor job if you searched around and did some basic certs
[00:08:35] <Sxem> palfish hires esl cell phone tutors, mostly for ppl in china. they pay $10 per hour and you can work as little or as much as you want
[00:08:45] <emmeka> Sxem now is the time to try, labour shortages everywhere
[00:08:47] <MootPoot> InStr(LengthString, "items")
[00:08:48] <Sxem> certification costs at least $3000
[00:08:56] <MootPoot> fuck - wrong computer
[00:08:59] <MootPoot> disregard
[00:09:03] <Sxem> you might still get some work uncertified
[00:09:14] <Sxem> but itd be like a max of 5-10 hours per week
[00:09:18] <emmeka> it's worth a try right now to see what you can get uncertified
[00:09:27] <emmeka> and then pursue the certs later if desired
[00:09:43] <Sxem> yeah id want to do it for just like 1 hour per day anyway
[00:09:54] <Sxem> altho i dont have a cell phone
[00:10:11] <Sxem> i do have an english degree tho
[00:10:14] <TsundereNoises> there is also online language tutoring
[00:10:20] <Sxem> which i think is the minimum you need
[00:10:33] <emmeka> Sxem oh really, then yeah, absolutely
[00:10:39] <emmeka> I think if you looked you'd get hired
[00:10:49] <Sxem> well, i think any bachelors degree will do, but english is the best one for this
[00:10:51] <emmeka> with the way things are right now, everyone and their mother is hiring
[00:10:57] <emmeka> and nobody can find workers
[00:11:16] <Sxem> also im very patient
[00:11:30] <Sxem> i never lose control of my emotions, like spock :)
[00:12:00] <MootPoot> even a baka sukebi like me is getting offers
[00:12:02] <MootPoot> somehow
[00:12:03] <Roey> well
[00:12:07] <Roey> spock lost control of his emotion
[00:12:08] <MootPoot> even though I'm already employed
[00:12:16] <Roey> and then spock lost control of his motion
[00:12:22] <Roey> cuz he dead
[00:12:34] <emmeka> then you and Llamamoe could talk shop and complain about your jobs as is the custom of any 2 people who share a profession
[00:13:00] <MootPoot> Spock rubbed his cock with some rocks and then went fock'en ell!
[00:13:13] <MootPoot> bad rhyme

[00:47:07] <ButterNoodle> we get 2 weeks of autumn colors
[00:47:10] <ButterNoodle> then its shit

[00:47:37] <ButterNoodle> I like the cold..
[00:47:49] <Fenderbassist> how's your health?
[00:47:52] <ButterNoodle> I took the kid out @ 35F
[00:47:57] <ButterNoodle> for a 2 mile
[00:48:01] <ButterNoodle> in the dark :)
[00:48:10] <Fenderbassist> giving the phrase "chillin with Dad" a new meaning
[00:48:13] <ButterNoodle> its good, best shape of my life I think
[00:48:22] <ButterNoodle> for sure.. had layers on for that
[00:48:24] <Fenderbassist> glad to hear
[00:48:45] <ButterNoodle> one of those hikes where ur freezing for the 1st half, sweating the 1nd half
[00:48:56] <Fenderbassist> bet you burned lots of calories whilst cold
[00:49:00] <ButterNoodle> hbu? new gigs, same band?
[00:49:12] <Fenderbassist> did the last band for a year, just left them a couple weeks ago
[00:49:18] <ButterNoodle> yea.. been maintaining that weight despite the turkey feast
[00:49:29] <Fenderbassist> looking for a different kind of band now
[00:49:30] <ButterNoodle> sorry to hear.. u got a new gig lined up?
[00:49:33] <ButterNoodle> ic
[00:49:38] <Fenderbassist> and probably a day job in January
[00:49:44] <ButterNoodle> woah
[00:49:50] <ButterNoodle> music related?
[00:49:54] <Fenderbassist> not sure yet
[00:50:00] <Fenderbassist> will see what's available after New Year
[00:50:44] <ButterNoodle> just getting some part time work?
[00:50:50] <Fenderbassist> probably full time
[00:50:51] <ButterNoodle> *day job
[00:50:56] <Fenderbassist> might be evenings
[00:51:09] <Fenderbassist> so that I can still help out with my father's care during the mornings/afternoons
[00:51:25] <Fenderbassist> he's gonna be 90 next year
[00:51:39] <Fenderbassist> very frail
[00:52:45] <ButterNoodle> wow, 90 is a milestone.. my grandfather made it to 86 iirc - dementia got him, otherwise he was walking a few miles of fence line every week :|
[00:53:00] <Fenderbassist> yeah my father has advanced dementia
[00:53:03] <Fenderbassist> so I relate
[00:53:22] <Fenderbassist> fortunately he's still very good natured, doesn't get angry
[00:53:30] <ButterNoodle> my mom is getting to that point where her health is in decline.. I think kidney failure will get her before dementia sets in
[00:53:41] <Fenderbassist> my regrets
[00:53:44] <ButterNoodle> my grandfather was mischievous..
[00:54:05] <ButterNoodle> he became non vocal, but would pull tricks on people all the time
[00:54:10] <Fenderbassist> lol
[00:54:24] <ButterNoodle> 2 of my aunts moved in w him for his last years
[00:54:32] <ButterNoodle> funny stories..
[00:54:32] <Fenderbassist> that's good
[00:54:43] <ButterNoodle> he still chewed some tennessee twist
[00:55:14] <Fenderbassist> living life to the fullest I see
[00:55:20] <ButterNoodle> *would pretend to spit on ur feet... and then use his spitter
[00:55:25] <Fenderbassist> rofl
[00:57:04] <ButterNoodle> sorry to hear about ur dad tho.. only thing I would pass on as a grandson, tell the grandkids to spend time w him bc the once the lucid moments are gone they'll have regrets
[00:57:18] <ButterNoodle> ik I do
[00:57:44] <Fenderbassist> they've had time with him, one is now in Europe and the other still works 7 days a week
[00:57:51] <Fenderbassist> ty for the tip though, much appreciated and very accurate
[00:57:52] <ButterNoodle> cool
[00:58:29] <Fenderbassist> father is now at the point of being able to answer yes and no questions
[00:58:40] <Fenderbassist> asking for an explanation is more than he can handle now
[00:58:47] <ButterNoodle> gotcha
[00:59:00] <Fenderbassist> it's sad but it's reality, so we deal with it
[00:59:18] <Fenderbassist> he worked all his life, we keep him as comfortable at home as possible
[00:59:43] <Fenderbassist> and I take him for rides every day I'm there, he loves that
[00:59:52] <Fenderbassist> 1 hour drive in the car, scenic routes
[01:00:25] <ButterNoodle> yea, to bad we cant retire as young adults and work our golden years away..
[01:00:48] <Fenderbassist> is why I tell the young ones to plan a career and choose wisely if they're going to Uni
[01:00:56] <Fenderbassist> do what you love to do, if you can

[01:39:58] <MootPoot> unsalted

[02:31:22] <S_T_A_N> donkey kong december is still living rent free in my head and I hate it
[02:31:46] <Nanobot> Me, yesterday: "My week-long break is almost over. I'm going to spend today playing a nice pleasant game. Let's see... where did I leave off in Ocarina of Time? Oh, the water temple. Oh, I forgot this game has excruciatingly awful play control and camera control. Okay, I hate everything now." Me, today: "Okay, fuck games. I'll catch up on some anime. Let's see.. Realist Hero. Seems like a neat series. Cool cool... Aaaaaand the main heroine cuts her hair. 
[02:31:46] <Nanobot> I hate everything now."
[02:34:07] <MootPoot> time to grow a new fetish
[02:34:11] <MootPoot> but yes
[02:34:14] <MootPoot> I get your feels

[02:34:33] <MootPoot> shit camera controls/controls in general 
[02:34:41] <MootPoot> and when a waifu cutes her hair
[02:34:42] <MootPoot> lame
[02:35:57] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I'm still not over the haircut in net-juu no susume
[02:36:49] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: Yeah, that was so stupid. Asks the guy she likes what hair style he prefers. He says long. She cuts her hair short. WTF?
[02:37:09] <Fenderbassist> the "will you still love me" test I guess
[02:37:18] <S_T_A_N> short hair is better than long on women 
[02:37:23] <TsundereNoises> hair stylist is a tsundere
[02:37:28] <Nanobot> No, it was presented like the hair stylist pressured her into it.
[02:37:32] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N: you should leave

[02:40:14] <Nanobot> Why long hair on women is better than short hair: 1. Look at it. 2. Why are you still reading this?
[02:40:24] <MootPoot> we have purified ##anime today lads

[02:40:52] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot makes an excellent argument, I am persuaded
[02:41:04] <MootPoot> same, I approve of his logic
[02:41:28] <MootPoot> tbh I'm okay with like shorter hair, but I dont like short hair
[02:41:32] <MootPoot> does that make sense
[02:41:42] <MootPoot> like if it can go down to shoulders thats enough , although more is better
[02:41:47] <Fenderbassist> so no Sinead O'Connor

[02:45:54] <S_T_A_N> anyone else buying the Jobless fig
[02:46:06] <TsundereNoises> if not long, the next best is like short-hair senjougahara hair
[02:46:31] <TsundereNoises> like chin length
[02:47:03] <Nanobot> Things you can do with long hair: Braid it, put it into a ponytail, put it into twintails, tie it up, let it loose, half-updo with a ribbon, and so on. Things you can do with short hair: Grow it out.
[02:47:25] <S_T_A_N> Short hair is still better
[02:48:29] <S_T_A_N> reverse the scale! longhair men. Shorthair women!
[02:48:37] <Nanobot> Long hair everyone
[02:49:00] <gitargy> short hair > long hair
[02:49:04] <S_T_A_N> no hair everyone
[02:49:08] <Nanobot> I would have long hair, but I physically can't grow it much past shoulder length before it starts thinning.

[02:49:55] <gitargy> short hair is good for your shower drain
[02:49:57] <S_T_A_N> Sxem, keep letting it go. Once you get past the bad curl you get to the good curl
[02:50:10] <Sxem> i grew it shoulder length in college and had to wear a bandana and pony tail and take like 30 very painful mins once per week to untangle it
[02:50:13] <TsundereNoises> my hair almost wants to fro-up if it gets too long, I don't like it

[04:33:47] <TsundereNoises> I think from a math point of view it's basically a small chance each year, the reason it's more likely as you get older is a combo of it getting a bit more likely each year and just additive probability, you'll have had it at some point

[05:02:09] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: I used to make smoothies with bananas, honey and tofu
[05:02:23] <MootPoot> I would try that but too much sugar for me
[05:02:31] <Fenderbassist> yeah I did it in my 20s
[05:02:34] <Fenderbassist> I wouldn't try it now lol
[05:02:36] <MootPoot> lol
[05:02:39] <MootPoot> I'm in my 20s
[05:02:40] <Fenderbassist> agreed, too much sugar
[05:02:41] <MootPoot> but still
[05:02:42] <MootPoot> best not to
[05:02:46] <Fenderbassist> I understand
[05:02:46] <TsundereNoises> adding sugar to smoothies always seems weird to me
[05:02:54] <TsundereNoises> assuming they have mostly fruit
[05:02:58] <Fenderbassist> raw unfiltered honey rocks
[05:03:00] <MootPoot> if your fruit isen't good enough then you have to
[05:03:08] <TsundereNoises> honey is delicious, just fruit is also sweet
[05:03:21] <Fenderbassist> but yeah I wouldn't add honey to a mixed berry smoothie
[05:04:19] <gitargy> While I have never personally added sugar to my smoothies I expect that most people do.
[05:04:28] <MootPoot> when I get smoothies in NA I have to sugar them 
[05:04:38] <MootPoot> due to the fruit being relatively tasteless
[05:04:45] <gitargy> NA?
[05:04:49] <MootPoot> in S and SE asia I dont need to
[05:04:55] <Fenderbassist> North America?
[05:05:02] <gitargy> oh
[05:05:03] <MootPoot> quality of produce there is much higher but you have to select only seasonal fruit
[05:05:07] <Fenderbassist> is my best guess
[05:05:11] <MootPoot> yes
[05:05:12] <Fenderbassist> I'm assuming that was the intended meaning

[05:10:58] <MootPoot> they are sweet, but the point is to have a natrual fruit sweetness
[05:10:59] <gitargy> they are kinda expensive tho
[05:11:03] <MootPoot> and flavour

[05:22:33] <amigojapan> gitargy: subsidies to diabetes?
[05:22:51] <gitargy> Medical industry is big business
[05:22:52] <MootPoot> well - it was originally to help the farmers
[05:23:11] <MootPoot> then the food manufacturers realized how cheaply they could make sweet stuff out of it
[05:23:15] <MootPoot> from there 
[05:24:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: farmers could make Stevia instead, that is natural
[05:24:58] <MootPoot> well, stevia is a manufactured product as well
[05:25:12] <MootPoot> under the same line corn syrup would be natrual as well
[05:25:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: also not everything needs to be sweet
[05:25:20] <TsundereNoises> cinnamon doesn't really just take the place of sugar, that's not really how flavor works
[05:25:32] <TsundereNoises> but cinnamon is really good and should be in more things, and you don't need nearly as much per volume
[05:25:53] <TsundereNoises> we measure price per volume, but cinnamon is a hell of a lot more flavorful per volume(although still not cheap)
[05:26:02] <MootPoot> its not really a problem if its not natrual or 100% manufactured
[05:26:24] <MootPoot> its just really  a health issue
[05:26:30] <MootPoot> I dont care much beyond that
[05:26:33] <TsundereNoises> yeah being natural doesn't make things inherently better, lots of natural things are bad for you
[05:27:05] <MootPoot> but generally speaking natrual foods are more in line with what we should be eating and in the right quantities
[05:27:08] <TsundereNoises> you could distill your fructose purely from bananas and if you ate the same amount it would still be awful
[05:27:09] <gitargy> botulinum toxin is natural
[05:27:21] <gitargy> kek
[05:27:22] <TsundereNoises> it's just easier to get more in corn syrup, practically speaking
[05:27:29] <MootPoot> for example eating 6 oranges is much harder then drinking a glass of juice 
[05:27:38] <MootPoot> although it takes 6 oranges to make juice
[05:27:48] <MootPoot> so you get the concentrated calories
[05:27:49] <MootPoot> etc
[05:28:58] <amigojapan> People have too much of a sweet tooth
[05:29:14] <MootPoot> kind of
[05:29:15] <MootPoot> not really
[05:29:22] <MootPoot> I think
[05:29:41] <MootPoot> the way we preseve and present food requires heavy doses of sweetener to make it half decent
[05:29:44] <gitargy> main problem with sugar is that eating a lot of it is analogous to running a diesel engine with lighter fluid. That and people are physiologically predisposed to consume as much as possible
[05:30:06] <MootPoot> natural things are plenty sweet - humans are hardwired to like sweet things
[05:30:28] <MootPoot> the issue is we have to dump that shit in our boxed processed food to make it remotely close to decent
[05:30:49] <MootPoot> although I'm just a deredere
[05:30:55] <MootPoot> you might get a better answer from TsundereNoises 
[05:31:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there is no good reason to put sugar in coffee or tea
[05:31:42] <gitargy> ^^^
[05:31:46] <MootPoot> 'good reason' is arbitrary 
[05:31:57] <MootPoot> but also you already put sugar in coffee / tea

[05:38:14] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: in many causes it's not our fault. They only sell sweetened thigns
[05:38:22] <TsundereNoises> most processed food is way too sweet for me
[05:38:58] <TsundereNoises> and that's like a palette development thing, I'm not special, it's just compared to the rest of my diet
[05:39:03] <TsundereNoises> because I mostly eat food I cook myself
[05:39:25] <TsundereNoises> when you live of McDonald's, you start wanting stuff sweeter and saltier because of where your default is
[05:39:58] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, it's really hard to even buy a canned drink that isn't too sweet, even the sugar free stuff has so much artificial sweetener it tastes gross
[05:40:06] <TsundereNoises> exception is like unsweetened tea

[05:41:21] <MootPoot> at least whle I'm on this die t
[05:41:39] <TsundereNoises> but like making desserts for thanksgiving, what I think is a bit too sweet, my diabetic mother things isn't sweet enough
[05:41:42] <TsundereNoises> and a lot of that is a diet thing
[05:41:49] <MootPoot> I'm going to try to get myself down to a normal level at some point when I'm in a normal weight range ( read = cute girls might date me_
[05:42:29] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I think diabetes makes you crave sweets
[05:42:31] <TsundereNoises> I mean, eating less sugar is a really good way to end up eating fewer calories

[06:24:18] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: that logic doesn't distinguish anything though
[06:24:34] <TsundereNoises> do you crave sweets because of diabetes, or did you get diabetes because you tend to crave sweets
[06:24:51] <TsundereNoises> or because you feel you can't have them and that's how human psychology works
[06:25:09] <TsundereNoises> it's just not a thing you can even get evidence for based on "person X craves sweets"

[06:26:02] <Fenderbassist> gotcha, cool
[06:26:02] <Nanobot> I think I kind of hate the new Minecraft 1.18 world generation. It throws so many weird biomes together in a small area (like, a desert, swamp, forest, mega taiga, and frozen biome all in one view, and that's pretty typical), and there's way too much elevation change everywhere. Traversing mountains in Minecraft isn't fun, and now that's everything.

[08:28:53] <ButterNoodle> and maple syrup
[08:28:59] <ButterNoodle> and permafrost
[08:29:00] <TsundereNoises> actually I think scotland or somewhere MADE curling
[08:29:03] <TsundereNoises> but canada perfected it

[08:30:48] <SummerSkies> amigojapan: but is it understandable why I would think that
[08:30:52] <gitargy> I thought french fries were actually american and they were called "french" for marketing purposes
[08:31:16] <ButterNoodle> its a lot more fun to jam my dick in peach, than jelly my dick all over kentucky

[08:32:42] <gitargy> I think they were made up by a Japanese immigrant
[08:32:48] <TsundereNoises> yeah, the old timey fortune cookie factory in San Francisco is really neat to visit, and the cookies are much better
[08:33:01] <SummerSkies> are the fortunes better
[08:33:08] <TsundereNoises> than the ones they use in any of the chinese places not in SF
[08:33:13] <TsundereNoises> eh, some of them
[08:33:16] <TsundereNoises> I think they do custom ones
[08:33:24] <ButterNoodle> my fortune cookie said "please try again"

[09:04:10] <MootPoot> I know the feel
[09:04:34] <senti> :D ... :/
[09:04:38] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: producer is the money, director is the actually in charge of the movie
[09:05:05] <MootPoot> then why not just call it sponsor
[09:05:14] <senti> Hi Tsunde!
[09:05:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: producer can have more or less control over fine details depending, but director decides camera angles, tells actors what to do, tweaks the script in a lot of cases, decides HOW they'll do whatever is in the script
[09:05:46] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: because they at least used to be in charge of a lot of the other details: catering, renting out the sets, getting permits, etc
[09:05:58] <TsundereNoises> I think
[09:06:04] <senti> MootPoot: we don't use git at the new job. we use svn.
[09:06:09] <TsundereNoises> mostly I'm going off shit in dvd commentaries

[09:06:48] <senti> MootPoot: I'm dealing with old ass code from 2006
[09:06:53] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, so producers were in charge of "the production" as I understand it, and paying for shit, getting paperwork done on time, etc
[09:07:03] <MootPoot> senti: lucky you, I'm just dealing with ass code
[09:07:06] <TsundereNoises> director is the boss of like who is doing what, when, and how in the actual shooting of the movie
[09:07:17] <senti> old ass code > ass code ?
[09:07:24] <TsundereNoises> cinematographer is technically in charge of the specific camera work but that tends to be a fuzzy line with the director
[09:07:26] <TsundereNoises> on a lot of movies anyway
[09:08:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: when I like 10/10 love a movie and want to make others watch it, I buy it on dvd (and often watch the commetary and special features and whatever)

[09:08:53] <MootPoot> do you kidnap them and tie them to a chair
[09:08:57] <MootPoot> and then play it on repeat
[09:12:04] <TsundereNoises> wtf is amazon's algorithm on? "Serial killer just a girl premium meme prayer journal 2021"
[09:12:15] <MootPoot> I'd watch that
[09:12:20] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: because everyone has a way to play dvds
[09:12:27] <MootPoot> not me
[09:12:28] <TsundereNoises> and many things aren't streaming on something everyone has
[09:12:40] <MootPoot> I dont have a single working dvd/cd player
[09:12:42] <MootPoot> in my house
[09:12:45] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: also, for some movies I WOULD kidnap people and duct tape them to the chair
[09:12:58] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: how is that possible?
[09:13:05] <TsundereNoises> with all the computer shit you must have around
[09:13:16] <MootPoot> no computer since like
[09:13:17] <MootPoot> idk
[09:13:24] <MootPoot> 2015 Ive bought has one
[09:13:36] <MootPoot> and I've literally never used them either
[09:13:41] <MootPoot> everything is a online download
[09:13:45] <TsundereNoises> dare I ask how many computers you've bought since 2015?
[09:13:59] <amigojapan> Can you pay for air BnB in cash?
[09:14:00] <MootPoot> its actually refreshing when things have a optical drive
[09:14:10] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I dont think so - not when I used it
[09:14:20] <TsundereNoises> I mean on new computers, I admit I have to select for it
[09:14:21] <MootPoot> unless you use a debit card or something
[09:14:27] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot that sucks
[09:14:27] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  uh....
[09:14:37] <TsundereNoises> but like doesn't everyone in this channel have a bunch of old computers lying around
[09:14:39] <TsundereNoises> just on principle
[09:14:46] <MootPoot> I think the number is somewhere around 18
[09:14:51] <MootPoot> since 2015
[09:14:57] <MootPoot> maybe 20
[09:15:17] <MootPoot> I dont own a console anyways
[09:15:21] <MootPoot> so no player in that
[09:15:40] <TsundereNoises> ...
[09:15:42] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: well - most people here are established boomers in their homes
[09:15:44] <TsundereNoises> I don't understand
[09:15:50] <MootPoot> I moved countries like in 2014
[09:15:58] <MootPoot> and i'm a zoomer
[09:16:02] <TsundereNoises> either part of this, but mostly the 18 computers in 7 years thing
[09:16:15] <MootPoot> and also I dont keep old stuff that isen't useful/work anymore
[09:16:24] <MootPoot> retro computing is cool as an idea to me
[09:16:25] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: what do you mean not useful!
[09:16:47] <MootPoot> how does owning a pentium 4 pc help me do anything I want in my life
[09:16:52] <MootPoot> answer : it dosent
[09:16:55] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I'll have you know, just the other week I fixed a cd drive by taking the rubber band *cough* I mean "drive belt" from an old cd drive in a broken computer
[09:16:57] <MootPoot> so out it goes
[09:17:03] <TsundereNoises> that's usefule
[09:17:23] <MootPoot> if you have a bunch of dvds sure
[09:17:31] <MootPoot> I have a 40TB NAS system
[09:17:33] <MootPoot> for all my video
[09:18:08] <MootPoot> oldest thing I own is a intel 8086 I bought on a whim
[09:19:03] <MootPoot> but yeah that's pretty much it
[09:19:15] <MootPoot> either my old computers die - or aren't useful to me anymore
[09:19:21] <MootPoot> so I give them away
[09:19:29] <MootPoot> to n00bs who need them
[09:19:42] <TsundereNoises> maybe I should just beg you for a computer next time
[09:19:52] <MootPoot> lol
[09:19:55] <TsundereNoises> seeing as you go through about 40 computer to my 1
[09:20:00] <MootPoot> currently I have like 13 or something
[09:20:40] <TsundereNoises> I have a 1st gen ipad, it can't connect to the internet anymore, but it can read pdfs and that's sometimes useful
[09:20:47] <TsundereNoises> I got it free
[09:21:00] <TsundereNoises> that's most of my tech really
[09:21:00] <MootPoot> I have a not-working anymore g4 ( no cellular ) 
[09:21:04] <MootPoot> and two g3s
[09:21:08] <MootPoot> and a nexus 7
[09:21:13] <MootPoot> and a tab s2 
[09:21:16] <MootPoot> and a tab s7
[09:21:23] <MootPoot> and a lg v60 as my main phone
[09:21:28] <MootPoot> and a iphone 8 as my work phone
[09:21:33] <TsundereNoises> my secondary computer literally came from a dumpster
[09:22:06] <TsundereNoises> at the time it was actually really surprisingly fine
[09:22:08] <MootPoot> I had my own box when I was like 8
[09:22:37] <MootPoot> although it helps that my pops was a programmer to
[09:22:43] <MootPoot> so I just used to get passed like
[09:22:48] <MootPoot> 2 computers a year
[09:22:49] <TsundereNoises> I had a computer in my room when I was like 12 I think? My dad always gave us the ones that were too old for his work
[09:22:50] <MootPoot> lol
[09:23:03] <TsundereNoises> yeah I got the "this one is too slow to function" computers
[09:23:04] <MootPoot> 11 year old with like 4 laptops
[09:23:04] <TsundereNoises> all my life
[09:23:16] <MootPoot> I just got "I got a better one so here" 
[09:23:22] <MootPoot> but they were still workable
[09:23:27] <MootPoot> although craptops
[09:23:29] <gitargy> I recon computers will last pretty long if you don't want to run games on them
[09:23:41] <MootPoot> games dont really shorten the lifetime of computers
[09:23:43] <MootPoot> or well
[09:23:54] <MootPoot> its that games are a little unique
[09:24:12] <MootPoot> in that they are the only common consumer application which constantly increase their performance demands
[09:24:26] <MootPoot> that's not really true other things
[09:25:13] <MootPoot> if all you need is excel and a text editor in 2011, the same computer will work fine in 2021 for the same tasks

[09:26:50] <gitargy> let me rephrase that
[09:26:53] <gitargy> What do yall use?
[09:27:02] <gitargy> I use firefox
[09:27:11] <TsundereNoises> mostly the power of my anger at whatever browser I'm using and the fact that the rest also suck

[09:28:28] <MootPoot> as long as your actual applications or work does not change
[09:28:32] <MootPoot> computers last a LONG time
[09:29:00] <MootPoot> problem with that is people like amigo think everyone has the same demands they do and their demands dont scale with what the computer can do
[09:29:02] <gitargy> the one thing i like about the fox is the mobile version supports browser extensions 
[09:29:07] <MootPoot> which is the case for some other people

[10:00:02] <zoidberg> ah, I see. I don't code at all senti. I am not in IT
[10:00:04] <senti> but ultimately, lack strong feelings for the language itself, I just dislike Oracle a whole lot.
[10:00:55] <senti> that said, it's been so many years, I've forgotten why I truly hate oracle.
[10:01:08] <senti> I'm happy to not have to find out why.
[10:01:22] <zoidberg> that's good senti, it's pointless to have any feeling towards programming languages
[10:02:08] <senti> zoidberg: I dislike .net stuff as well. So lacking that and java, it's a slightly tighter market for finding jobs.
[10:02:29] <senti> guess I should hang unto the one I've got.

[10:07:04] <zoidberg> nah, I did in the past

[11:35:23] <DunceCotus> Walter Leland Cronkite Jr. (November 4, 1916 – July 17, 2009) was an American broadcast journalist who served as anchorman for the CBS Evening News[1] for 19 years (1962–1981). During the 1960s and 1970s, he was often cited as "the most trusted man in America" after being so named in an opinion poll.
[11:35:48] <amigojapan> Oh I had no idea he was dead DunceCotus 
[11:36:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: basically America was living in an age of cronkite.. and that game simulates it

[11:37:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: his passing quite recently too

[11:38:04] <gitargy> snake: how can do I access this leaderboard
[11:38:08] <DunceCotus> surely we saw Larry King die of a stroke or something in the 90s
[11:38:33] <DunceCotus> what on Earth is going on? Well. From here we need to conceive of Earth as a multiplicity perhaps

[12:07:04] <DunceCotus> but in this instance at least I'm not being sarcastic
[12:07:11] <DunceCotus> its true in this metaphor

[12:07:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well not entirely
[12:07:42] <DunceCotus> problematic indeed
[12:08:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I wonder why you think that though
[12:08:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: even in antient times, if many many people for together, they could move a mountain
[12:08:45] <DunceCotus> this was more a paraphrase of Jesus
[12:08:54] <DunceCotus> where he's saying with faith it has the power to move mountains
[12:09:05] <DunceCotus> and I think it was meant individual faith, not many many people per se
[12:09:28] <amigojapan> That is a matter of interpretation
[12:09:48] <DunceCotus> well I think reading it that way kinda explains how Jesus is capable of doing all these miracles
[12:09:54] <DunceCotus> he is using the power of the species
[12:10:07] <DunceCotus> through individual faith

[16:25:19] <senti> The Gantz manga is nice imo. The anime is shoddy but worth a watch (probably hasn't aged well though).

[16:29:35] <senti> colleges/universities, at least in the USA, tend to be businesses at heart above everything else. Half the shit you take wounds up being filler for the tuition you're paying.
[16:30:45] <amigojapan> Ok zoidberg I finally had dinner
[16:31:15] <senti> while those general courses will make your more "well-rounded" and "broaden your horizens", the value of that will vary depending on the future one is actually pursuing (read: I doubt it's worth much to most).
[16:31:35] <Unbreedable2> honestly i don't really know what to do. I was in material science but i've always been interested in computer science but i do not have monney to start a new course. So i'm thinking about learning it by my own. I have no idea what i should start with
[16:32:50] <amigojapan> Unbreedable2: try the MIT open courseware on CS
[16:32:59] <senti> Unbreedable2: awesome! Give Python a go! It's an excellent language to start with and you don't have to get straight into the cruft of OOP (object oriented programming)

[16:34:38] <senti> amigojapan: sure, but for a beginner, oop isn't really necessary, imo
[16:35:12] <amigojapan> senti: depending on the person they may be better off starting with 3dpl
[16:35:18] <senti> personally, for quick scripts, composing everything with just functions is sufficient.

[16:36:01] <amigojapan> Yes

[16:36:46] <senti> I've been coding for over 13 years.
[16:36:49] <amigojapan> Unbreedable2: I studied software engineering in school
[16:36:53] <darkwitch> material science isn't so bad
[16:37:38] <senti> My recommendation, learn something you can actually use in a job later on.
[16:38:20] <darkwitch> learn what you are excited to learn
[16:38:35] <senti> Even if it's "harder" or whatever. The point isn't for the language to teach you, but for the source of learning to teach you (whether that be a course on youtube, a tutorial site, or someone you're paying to tutor you personally)
[16:41:06] <senti> There's no magic pill you can take to suddenly become good. You have to spend a lot of time actually coding to become practiced. It's a damn worth-while journey if coding proves to be your thing. You don't know until you try it, so just do it.

[17:23:32] <darkwitch> there should really be two donuts in a covalent bond
[17:24:18] <amigojapan> darkwitch: good luck looking for such an image
[17:24:22] <senti> amigojapan: I took a course that used C++ and Allegro in college as well. Allegro is pretty nice for 2D stuff, though at the time, it had some shortcomings with music playback or something. I can't remember. Probably much better these days I imagine.
[17:24:29] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[17:25:07] <amigojapan> senti: my course did not include Allegro. I just got that on my own
[17:25:37] <senti> oh, interesting. Allegro isn't a bad choice (unless if you're doing 3D maybe. At least back in the old days)
[17:26:03] <amigojapan> senti: unfortunately I don't think they have updated much of Allegro since back in the day
[17:26:20] <senti> I was quite impressed by how well the program could render shit loads worth of moving sprites on the screen at once.

[17:27:27] <amigojapan> It helped me actually understand it
[17:27:28] <senti> I can see polymorphism being a big deal with games.
[17:27:59] <amigojapan> senti: even just objects with methods is very helpful
[17:28:27] <senti> functions with state passed in as a parameter is sufficient for that purpose, imo
[17:29:16] <senti> though, passing a state object around everywhere is a bit cumbersome.
[17:29:27] <amigojapan> senti: and oop is the way it is done professionally, I really like oop
[17:33:45] <amigojapan> senti: both microcontroller code and game engines seem to have come up with similar methods of dealing with stuff, a setup fiction to start setting up anything initial and a loop to update anything that is currently running.

[19:56:15] <zoidberg> We want simple and stupid shit ButterNoodle
[19:56:52] <ButterNoodle> yea.. thats why things like mint and manjaro exist.. it makes install easy

[19:57:31] <zoidberg> They do but the problem there is degree of freedom
[19:57:55] <ButterNoodle> I think mint has one of the easiest installs.. and u can do crypto partitions w it
[19:58:00] <ButterNoodle> plus its debian

[20:09:05] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: that's kind of a neat idea
[20:09:24] <Bco1981> Nanobot: you said Lui wasn't gonna play horror games... now i see a clip of her playing Outlast...
[20:09:25] <MootPoot> its a meat idea
[20:09:35] <JesseDesu> holy shit my thunderbolt hub plugged into my new M1 ipad with a usb guitar cable and FiiO DAC works together perfectly
[20:09:38] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: depends on the personality I think, and how much they've seen
[20:09:56] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: like if you're wanting to know about anime as a cultural thing, probably eva
[20:10:00] <TsundereNoises> but personally, I like Lain better
[20:10:03] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: welcome to modern tech
[20:10:03] <emmeka> zoidberg I mean if they've seen neither, I'd say Eva, as someone who doesn't actually particularly like Eva
[20:10:03] <zoidberg> Bco1981: are the prices of routers and stuff in your line of work have increased a lot in recent times?
[20:10:20] <JesseDesu> i havent practiced in 2 months but i still got the blues pentatonics down
[20:10:21] <MootPoot> emmeka: now replace "eva" with arch
[20:10:24] <ButterNoodle> sounds like a fire hazard JesseDesu
[20:10:24] <emmeka> it's one of those things that is required viewing just because of how much influence it had on everything that came after
[20:10:27] <MootPoot> and say it again
[20:10:32] <Nanobot> Bco1981: She said she hated horror games, but loves dating sims. So, she apparently planned her first dating streams to be a dating sim and a horror game. But the dating sim her manager picked out for her was DDLC.
[20:10:36] <zoidberg> emmeka: I recommended to binge Eva for the best.
[20:10:45] <zoidberg> Otherwise watch lain
[20:10:46] <Nanobot> *first gaming streams
[20:10:47] <emmeka> MootPoot I don't use Arch. I'll stay over here in pleb town.
[20:11:02] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: on the other hand, when I wasn't very into anime, someone who knew me pushed Lain on me (and I hadn't seen eva) and that was the right choice
[20:11:09] <MootPoot> at least pleb town dosen't break on you during an update
[20:11:20] <JesseDesu> lol what fire hazard

[20:11:37] <MootPoot> lolololol

[20:13:22] <ButterNoodle> yes zoidberg

[20:25:02] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: and I've tended to like things derived from debian in the past anyway

[20:25:14] <TsundereNoises> but never used the debian itself
[20:25:29] <emmeka> Debian is basically built for maximum stability, but that comes with the tradeoff of it being full of old shit

[20:27:17] <HeTo> if Debian stable is too old for you, you can use Debian testing
[20:27:29] <MootPoot> Also, I don't really get like 
[20:27:37] <MootPoot> Why being old/new is a concern 
[20:27:54] <TsundereNoises> I guess another thing to debate: do I stick with xfce or try one of these fancy desktops
[20:28:07] <MootPoot> Like aurora mentioned a new feature of Linux being that multiple connection thing for file transfer
[20:28:18] <MootPoot> But all we do here is look at cute girls 
[20:28:20] <emmeka> xfce is nice but every so often I encounter things that would be better with a more expansive desktop environment
[20:28:41] <Jigsy> French Linux users use Arc de Triomphe. I use arc btw.
[20:28:51] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yeah that's my debate, part of me wants to just stick to low resource boring stuff on principle
[20:28:54] <TsundereNoises> but do I?
[20:28:56] <MootPoot> So I don't really see the point of going for the bleeding edge Linux stuff

[20:29:39] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: old version of "bunsen labs" which was crunchbang basically
[20:30:11] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: that's essentially Debian, IIRC, with some special desktop theme or something
[20:30:16] <emmeka> Debian is good if you want an unbreakable dinosaur. That's why so many distros are based on it. It's built to be stable and is the perfect springboard to work from.
[20:30:16] <TsundereNoises> yeah
[20:30:26] <TsundereNoises> a few other changes but yes
[20:30:42] <TsundereNoises> okay I'm sold, thanks guys
[20:30:52] <TsundereNoises> part of this is I'm just indecisive because new things
[20:30:52] <emmeka> sold on what, Debian?
[20:30:57] <TsundereNoises> yes

[20:31:22] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: welcome to the Debian Lesbian club
[20:31:26] <Poeticode> I've been loving Gnome with the dash-to-dock extension. but xfce is naisu too
[20:31:51] <Bco1981> yes, i love girls so, perfect.
[20:31:54] <TsundereNoises> I also have puppy linux on the tower that I pulled out of the dumpster years ago
[20:31:54] <emmeka> whenever I build a new PC I'll probably go to Gnome. I've been on xfce for years.
[20:31:57] <MootPoot> work meetings are like a free break
[20:32:01] <TsundereNoises> which maybe I should throw out?
[20:32:25] <MootPoot> if you go to Gnome your files may go missing in the night
[20:32:28] <Poeticode> whoa dumpster computer :0
[20:32:29] <MootPoot> gnome'd
[20:32:32] <Bco1981> emmeka: i heard that gnome is not so good... still. that kde plasma is better.
[20:32:50] <emmeka> I could try either, Fedora has both as an option
[20:32:54] <TsundereNoises> Poeticode: fiancee's school threw it out because it was "broken" at the time all it took to fix it was deleting windows
[20:33:10] <emmeka> like it's happened enough times that there was a random dumb thing that xfce couldn't do that gnome could that I would consider switching
[20:33:12] <Poeticode> that's awesome TsundereNoises
[20:33:16] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I'm scared of gnome, in my mind it sucks even though I know that's like decade old bias
[20:33:19] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: I'm not using a DE on Debian either, it's not much of a problem to set Debian up to just run a window manager if you're used to that
[20:33:22] <Jigsy> There needs to be a fork of Fedora called Trilby.
[20:34:15] <Bco1981> gnome is still bad, according to this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTY620NUdPk

[20:35:36] <ButterNoodle> yea enjoy hardware obsolescence JesseDesu
[20:35:38] <emmeka> like I spent forever trying to get xfce keyboard settings to recognize the extra layouts file, and it doesn't, gsettings can do this. Or when I set up redshift on my wife's laptop, I figured out that despite having the appropriate location services installed by default, xfce can't deal with them, but gnome could, so I can't get automatic daylight period shifting based on IP

[20:36:54] <JesseDesu> now that i started using youtube music
[20:37:06] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] but it doesn't update automatically, I'd have to manually change it when we go somewhere
[20:37:16] <emmeka> which, I routinely travel hundreds of km north or south, so
[20:37:17] <TsundereNoises> I should really download all my cute hololive songs instead of relying on youtube forever
[20:37:55] <Bco1981> wow
[20:37:55] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] I could make it update automatically by other means but it's vaguely annoying and the easier solution just didn't work because xfce

[20:42:45] <MootPoot> not preference
[20:43:02] <MootPoot> like you mentioned earlier - if you want something new you have to wait 10 years or something for debian to get it
[20:43:13] <Bco1981> just go unstable
[20:43:17] <emmeka> are you asking for a specific example of a recent update that I would like to have as opposed to waiting years for it
[20:43:20] <MootPoot> yes
[20:43:21] <emmeka> Bco1981 but what's the point.
[20:43:28] <emmeka> why bother using Debian if not for stability
[20:43:37] <Bco1981> true
[20:43:54] <emmeka> if you want something Debian-based but less dinosaur-y there's hundreds of options
[20:44:12] <Urchin[emacs]> Debian is fine
[20:44:28] <MootPoot> what I'm trying to figure out here is that are these "features that you would want but are not in debian" are they like normie features or cutting edge server stuff that 0.00001% of people even know or care about
[20:44:31] <Urchin[emacs]> I've run into one case where Debian wasn't dinosaur-y enough
[20:44:57] <Urchin[emacs]> Ubuntu kept an old jpeg library, that for some reasons stuff still link to, so digging that up for Debian was a chore

[21:21:01] <JesseDesu> i need fried chicken
[21:22:03] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: that's really cool/obnoxious
[21:22:12] <TsundereNoises> I need to save it to show to kids one day
[21:22:20] <TsundereNoises> also wow, I'd forgotten how big Ganymede was
[21:22:26] <emmeka> TsundereNoises well there's subtext
[21:22:42] <emmeka> how angry are you at subtext that remains subtext and doesn't go anywhere explicit
[21:23:13] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: but why is there *two* aquarium yuribait works?
[21:23:14] <emmeka> there's definitely some very gay moments but they stop just short of anything actually yuri
[21:23:27] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] it's really bizarre, isn't it
[21:23:33] <Urchin[emacs]> it's like aquarium yuri bait is turning into a genre
[21:23:47] <emmeka> I can only assume that Aquatope directly ripped off the other one with the weird long title that I forget
[21:23:58] <Bco1981> Aquatrope

[21:26:57] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I mean as long as the other things are cute/sweet and there's no guy at the end, I'm okay with subtext
[21:27:01] <TsundereNoises> although it's not as good as text
[21:27:11] <emmeka> there's a guy but I'm not sure where it's going with him
[21:27:34] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs], emmeka: and remember how much random sea creatures feature in Bloom into you
[21:27:42] <emmeka> main girl is oblivious to the guy and that he obviously likes her, and rather than this being a serious plot point it is basically ignored, and she only pays attention to other girl
[21:28:04] <TsundereNoises> okay
[21:28:12] <TsundereNoises> the kind of yuribait that bugs me is random het ending
[21:28:22] <emmeka> it might still go that way

[21:28:43] <TsundereNoises> I'm not one of those people that was mad at Sakura Trick for being too ambiguous
[21:28:55] <emmeka> Sakura Trick is about 50x more yuri than this

[21:33:02] <emmeka> my wife and I can definitely pass as lesbians if I were to try

[22:26:02] <JesseDesu> thats the only way anything will get sold to gen z
[22:26:04] <Cryowolf> step 1 is to get a customers attention, step 2 is to make them listen, step 3 is to provide with with the information, while making it seem you didn't. Step 4 is to sell the product by simply listing it, or the campaign and what's going on

[23:09:57] <buZz> imho channels with just a single person in chanserv are basically just dead communities :)
[23:10:21] <Urchin[emacs]> buZz: sure, he did accept a ban, but another op unbanned him, fearing his founder status
[23:10:22] <emmeka> buZz he was the sole +F in the original Freenode channel, but himself never used op powers. +F means that no one but another person with +F can do anything to them, and someone with +F can unilaterally strip ops from people with +o
[23:10:48] <Urchin[emacs]> ^
[23:11:10] <emmeka> he considered himself a check and balance on ops, we considered it something he did to basically make him immune to repercussions for occasionally doing shitty things.
[23:11:11] <buZz> emmeka: he was argueing in #bitcoin that he doesnt even have time for irc
[23:11:17] <emmeka> this persisted for years and was not a big deal.
[23:11:18] <buZz> maybe just time to hand over the ropes

[23:16:28] <emmeka> that was basically our excuse so that Freenode staff wouldn't mess with us back then. But luke ran with it and insisted to libera staff that it's a legitimate FOSS project that he has sole right to moderate.
[23:16:31] <buZz> sococpp was also involved in this train of thought, i think?
[23:16:59] <buZz> he used to be active in #dogecoin a lot, but was the -sole- user that refused to move to libera when everyone else did

[23:27:34] <buZz> :)
[23:27:37] <emmeka> luke-jr I didn't say everyone, surely you remember this. I gave a very specific list of ops who had agreed to it. You took that list and removed ops from everyone on it, lol.
[23:27:43] <buZz> aurora is spicy too but way less
[23:27:59] <luke-jr> emmeka: I'm not going to repeat the whole conversation. Point is you misrepresented what occurred.
[23:28:00] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, but people with actual power have to be diplomatic

[23:30:40] <emmeka> TsundereNoises well if he did something obviously bannable we'd go through the normal processes, which usually isn't "ban first ask questions later"
[23:30:57] <luke-jr> emmeka: but every time someone makes the bogus claim that I used +F to be immune to rules, they imply they would have banned me for whatever

[23:31:02] <buZz> ButterNoodle: if you got questions, feel free

[23:36:24] <TsundereNoises> Satin: translator note is a rant about how it's weird to write it as Brothers Karamazov and people just being pretentious, I like him
[23:36:36] <Satin> TsundereNoises: rofl
[23:36:42] <Satin> wonderful
[23:36:46] <Satin> MootPoot: no
[23:36:48] <TsundereNoises> funny translator notes are big for me
[23:36:54] <Satin> def, they add
[23:37:20] <MootPoot> I need a dedicated rod to jam in my hole
[23:37:28] <MootPoot> so I can get my (track) ball out 
[23:37:56] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you might want to try a few rods before you settle down with a dedicated one
[23:37:59] <TsundereNoises> see what's out there, you know?
[23:39:38] * Satin snickers
[23:40:04] <MootPoot> I'd have to check with Satin , she knows more rods then I do
[23:40:16] <MootPoot> wooo
[23:40:17] <Satin> nop, you're the experienced one 
[23:40:18] <MootPoot> my ball is clean
[23:40:33] * MootPoot spins his ball freely
[23:40:49] <MootPoot> I wish they made some kind of self-cleaning trackball
[23:41:04] <MootPoot> although the only way I can imagine that happening would add pointless extra weight
[23:41:07] <MootPoot> and components
[23:41:42] <MootPoot> maybe I should wear a thumb condom
[23:41:54] <MootPoot> keep the dead skin from jamming up the ball
[23:43:09] <tcsilver> ... what do you mean rod gum ? :O
[23:43:17] <tcsilver> try rod gum ? :P
[23:43:34] <TsundereNoises> you know, when you don't wash your rod for a while and it starts to build up goop
[23:43:53] <tcsilver> lol
[23:44:23] <MootPoot> trackballs are amazing
[23:44:29] <MootPoot> aside from the maintainance

[23:46:17] * ButterNoodle checks for goop
[23:46:52] <ButterNoodle> tactical vertical laser track mouse with extra ball and strategic clitty
[23:47:10] <MootPoot> yes
[23:47:19] <MootPoot> some of the cheaper trackballs do kinda look like that
[23:47:27] <MootPoot> shaped like a vag
[23:47:47] <ButterNoodle> people that use trackballs still double click hyperlinks
[23:47:48] <MootPoot> giant trackball doubles as clit
[23:48:25] <ButterNoodle> giant trackballs double as anal toys
[23:49:43] <ButterNoodle> now I gotta buy optics...
[23:49:50] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: what optics u have
[23:50:02] <MootPoot> uh
[23:50:07] <MootPoot> I just buy bushnell
[23:50:21] <MootPoot> not really high end
[23:50:35] <MootPoot> I tried to get a nikon but afaik they stopped making optics
[23:50:38] <MootPoot> only old stuff
[23:50:51] <ButterNoodle> last bushnell I had fogged terribly
[23:51:02] <ButterNoodle> no shit.. didnt know nikon stoppe..
[23:51:14] <MootPoot> so I think I have two, a 3-12 40mm and a 6-24x at 40mm
[23:51:46] <ButterNoodle> I have one of their 50mms on my 24" ar
[23:51:48] <MootPoot> probably wasen't really profitable tbh
[23:52:18] <ButterNoodle> yea they were competing on the low end w simmons, bushnell, and vortex
[23:52:58] <MootPoot> were they? only time I looked up nikon's they had 100-200$ then the equivalent bushnell
[23:53:22] <ButterNoodle> I think my 50mm was <400
[23:53:42] <MootPoot> yeah
[23:53:48] <MootPoot> they're both bushnell banners
[23:53:56] <ButterNoodle> they had a few pricier ones.. but still.. not like a leopold vx5
[23:54:07] <MootPoot> there is some distortion at max zoom but
[23:54:10] <MootPoot> idk I'm happy
[23:54:15] <MootPoot> no complains
[23:54:22] <MootPoot> bullet goes where I point
[23:54:31] <ButterNoodle> I think I am gonna do the leopold vx3
[23:54:35] <ButterNoodle> its reasonable
[23:55:35] <ButterNoodle> want something w 1st focal plane and parallax adj
[23:56:29] <ButterNoodle> and a proper reticle, plex is for 22lr
