[00:04:41] <trafficjam60> hmm ok, well i'm just wondering if there would be any advantage of using a self-hosted password manager versus something like 1Password in terms of privacy/anonymity
[00:05:12] <mats1> yes
[00:05:44] <mats1> well, maybe
[00:06:29] <mats1> there presumably wouldn't be a line item in your bank statement to whatever corp
[00:06:59] <trafficjam60> oh yeah that's true, would that be the only benefit?
[00:07:13] <trafficjam60> like if i'm using an iphone in the first place, then at least apple has potential access to everything
[00:07:53] <trafficjam60> so going to a password managing company or apple, there's not much difference im guessing

[09:32:23] <ajak> my question wasn't to you
[09:32:26] <sam_> note that there's absolutely loads of keyservers
[09:32:35] <ajak> yeah
[09:32:38] <sam_> you may have to go poke around a few more. depending on the challenge, may need to try WKD or something for the site you got it from
[09:32:57] <ajak> i would also try avoiding web keyserver interfaces and just try `gpg --recv-key $KEY`
[09:33:34] <sam_> also, make sure you do something before the key :)
[09:33:40] <sam_> (it needs to be in a certain format)

[09:40:08] <sam_> LTCD: history lesson briefly
[09:40:17] <sam_> there was an aim to have a bunch of distributed/synchronising keyservers
[09:40:19] <sam_> "SKS keyservers"
[09:40:25] <sam_> it totally bombed, partly because of GDPR stuff
[09:40:31] <sam_> (and the same kind of concerns before GDPR existed)
[09:40:38] *** Joins: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg)
[09:40:40] <sam_> people would post keys, sometimes with maybe pictures of themselves, etc, and then want it removed
[09:41:21] <LTCD> LTCD is thinking of making a blockchain PGP server, attached to some shitcoin to become a millionaire.
[09:41:33] <mats1> it was worse than that, there was no validation of the content
[09:41:40] <sam_> hence "partly because"
[09:41:45] <sam_> feel free to explain the other reasons :)
[09:41:58] <ajak> mats1: is that unique to SKS?
[09:42:06] <LTCD> It's interesting, I never knew openpgp and ubuntu were the two main ones.
[09:42:17] <ajak> i don't know that there are "main ones"
[09:42:23] <sam_> eh
[09:42:27] <mats1> i'm not familiar with keyserver flavours
[09:42:32] <sam_> they are the main ones one in reality if someone doesn't send you a key :P

[09:42:54] <ajak> well so is MIT's and everyone else who runs a popular one lol
[09:43:00] <ajak> it's "decentralized"
[09:43:09] <sam_> MITs has been dead every time I tried to use it in the last year or so
[09:43:14] <sam_> may have just been the web interface but i dunno
[09:43:24] <mats1> sks smelled like a vanity project that accidentally became popular
[09:43:26] <LTCD> So what are the most popular ones then: openpg, ubuntu, mit...?
[09:43:42] <ajak> it's what i have set in gpg.conf, and it is used a bit since mutt will autofetch keys
[09:43:47] <sam_> huh, nice.
[09:43:50] <LTCD> What is WKS?
[09:43:51] <mats1> guy wrote it in ocaml and didn't do basic things like rejecting pubkeys without self sigs
[09:44:15] <sam_> https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD#Web_Key_Directory_.28WKD.29_.2F_Web_Key_Service_.28WKS.29_what_is_the_difference.3F
[09:44:17] <mats1> that became possible later, but it wasn't turned on by default
[09:44:25] <sam_> but the gist is that gpg looks in a certain location on websites if you tell it to, to look for keys
[09:44:36] <sam_> .well-known/blahblah
[09:44:54] <LTCD> sam_ Thanks.
[09:45:16] <sam_> LTCD: the nice thing being, if someone sends you an email, you can then (or your mail client can) check the domain it was sent from
[09:45:24] <sam_> and ask the webserver if it has a key
[09:45:34] <sam_> there's a bit more to it, there's also variants like you can put keys in DNS records
[09:45:45] <sam_> i don't think any of it is super well documented even though it's quite cool

[12:06:05] <ychaouche> hello folks, I am a little late to the log4j party, can anyone recommend good reading for sysadmins ? like the only thing I care about for the moment is how do I know if log4j is used on any of the systems I administer ?
[12:06:15] <ychaouche> It seems this is only used by java programs, right ?
[12:09:11] <`Tim> and potentially other jvm running software, for example in scala, kotlin, jruby, jython etc
[12:10:38] <ychaouche> I am reading a security report by a local "security" company that says it affects the "apache stack"
[12:10:53] <ychaouche> I'm not really confident apache httpd uses java, does it ?
[12:11:02] <ychaouche> for serving php websites that is.
[12:11:19] <`Tim> apache is a foundation foremost; with a lot java software
[12:11:43] <`Tim> i doubt they meant the httpd
[12:12:33] <ychaouche> Ok, I shortcircuited to httpd
[12:12:49] <`Tim> as to finding; you could start looking for the name in filenames; if the software in question just has a directory of jars it loads, that could already find it
[12:13:24] <`Tim> if it's being packaged differently, like all dependencies into a monster jar, you might have to look into those
[12:13:56] <`Tim> although even then you might find a log4j properties file outside somewhere

[12:17:45] <ychaouche> yeah, the security report I'm reading suggests to find / -name "*.jar" then grep on log4j
[12:18:06] <ychaouche> so, log4j should be in the jar's filename ?
[12:18:14] <`Tim> it's the most likely setup, yes
[12:18:56] <ychaouche> oh ok
[12:19:45] <ychaouche> lol, I have two jars in my whole system
