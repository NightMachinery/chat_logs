[03:32:58] <sshine> alMalsamo, the 'T' in zk-STARK means transparent, and refers to the fact that all verifier messages are just publicly sampled random bits. for zk-SNARKs you need to initialize with a random string that you have to convince the world you forgot.
[03:36:33] *** Joins: SlimeyNarcissist (~blank@user/slimmyjimmy)
[03:37:04] <sshine> alMalsamo, i.e., the setup phase of zk-SNARKs take as input non-public random data.

[03:50:57] <sshine> alMalsamo, the details don't make a lot of sense unless you look at what the two protocols actually do. they're both kinda complicated. I don't have a reference to a zk-SNARK implementation's setup phase.

[04:03:42] <sshine> alMalsamo, but if you're interested in zk-STARKs, have a look at prove() and verify() here: https://github.com/aszepieniec/stark-anatomy/blob/master/code/fast_stark.py#L83 -- the public randomness are the 'randomizers' added here. eventually you can verify a STARK proof without any additional random input, and these are sent via the proof_stream, so publicly.

[14:17:37] <sshine> solrize, they're made popular in the blockchain space because of their potential to move computation off-chain. but they're pretty cool in their own right, since you can prove properties about the execution of a program and only reveal certain commitments that are part of the computation.
[14:18:21] <gevreeen> nvm, tried base16 and it matches
[14:19:46] <alMalsamo> sshine: How does it work in practice to have non-public input?  I am not sure I understand how they work with data that is somehow hidden and only possessed by certain users... in practical example Zcash and Pirate Chain both use zk-SNARKs so what data is not public there and who exactly possesses this non-public randomized input data?
[14:19:49] <sshine> caveman, sounds like you could use a Merkle Mountain Range.

[14:24:59] <alMalsamo> sshine: Really?  as I understand it in Zcash for example not all transactions use zk-SNARKs only shieled transactions do, so how can it help with scalability when most of the transactions are not even using zk-SNARKs?

[14:36:16] <sshine> caveman, I posted an answer with a link. sorry for not expanding properly on it.
[14:37:21] <sshine> alMalsamo, so... the fact that it's opt-in is mostly a problem wrt. privacy, I think, since you're only anonymous proportional to the group of people you can hide in.

[14:38:14] <yawkat> alMalsamo: well, non-shielded txs presumably dont need zkps at all
[14:39:05] <sshine> alMalsamo, wrt. scalability: the fact that you don't actually publish your computation, but only a hash digest that works as a commitment you can prove to interested parties, will have a net benefit on scalability proportional to how much people use it.
[14:39:39] <yawkat> alMalsamo: and for zksnarks, hopefully nobody has the private information, but it has to exist once for the initial setup

[15:37:18] <caveman> e.g. someone who only knows about the 1st hash ever.

[16:15:26] <sshine> caveman, someone who recently joined only needs the existing peaks to append a hash digest.

[16:19:20] <int-e> if you have an authentic root hash, and you reach that... either the peaks are authentic, or somebody knows how to compute collisions (really close to preimages, really) for your hash function
[16:19:49] <sshine> caveman, I'm not totally familiar with this, and I'm still sort of translating the way you prove/authenticate a Merkle tree into how you do something similar for MMRs.
[16:20:15] <int-e> hmm
[16:20:36] <int-e> I should look up MMRs (now that google actually finds something; MRR didn't work :P)
[16:20:42] <sshine> caveman, but if you have h_1 and h_n and you want to verify that the peaks of an MMR have not been tampered with, you need something called a Merkle Mountain Range Authentication Path :P
[16:21:42] <sshine> caveman, for Merkle trees, if you have the root and a leaf, you can show that the tree under the root contains the leaf using an authentication path (being the least amount of sibling hash digests needed to hash your way up to the root).
[16:23:07] *** Joins: vernaz (~vernaz@148.63.127.167)
[16:23:28] <sshine> caveman, for a MMR, you have something similar: instead of a single root, you have the peaks (and for the trivial case where you have 2^k leaf hash digests, there is exactly one peak, and so it resembles a Merkle tree)
[16:23:43] <int-e> why don't they use standard terminology and call it a Merkle forest :-/
[16:24:06] *** Joins: ardell (~ardell@user/ardell)
[16:24:21] <sshine> int-e, Merkle forest is standard terminology?
[16:24:31] <int-e> "forest" for a set of trees is standard
[16:25:15] <sshine> it's not really a set of separate trees, they're intertwined
[16:25:29] <sshine> but you're right, they kinda break with the tree metaphor
[16:26:14] <TimMc> A forest is a list of trees.
[16:26:23] <TimMc> or set, yeah
[16:26:30] <TimMc> annoying
[16:28:00] <sshine> maybe a Merkle Shrubbery would be better
[16:28:32] <sshine> because the subsequent peaks represent "trees" that are almost entirely grown into the tree with the highest peak
[16:28:58] <sshine> also, if you squint, it really looks more like a mountain range than a shrubbery or a forest. :)
[16:31:50] <sshine> caveman, so if you have any hash digests that went into making the MMR, you also need some minimal amount of digests (the authentication path) that leads to them in order to know that the MMR represents a well-known state.
[16:34:25] <sshine> caveman, then some time passes where you're not paying attention, and a bunch of new hash digests get appended to the MMR. that means there are new peaks; you can verify that the new peaks are an extension of a mountain range you already know.
[16:35:10] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[16:36:46] <sshine> caveman, but you'd need some leaf hash digest (the ones at the bottom) from the new range, as well as its authentication path, to verify that *it* is in the MMR.
[16:37:27] <cvmn> 'but'?  did i miss anything before that 'but'?
[16:38:44] <sshine> s/but //

[16:39:20] <cvmn> thanks a lot.
[16:44:03] <sshine> caveman, sorry, I'll shut up now :) I'm trying to explain something that I didn't fully understand myself yet.
[16:45:39] <cvmn> sshine: you're still helpful.  helping me think.  so what's your latest thought now?  to trust peaks, we need O(n) space and time?
[16:45:43] <int-e> sshine: that's a good way to learn and (usually) get embarrassed at the same time

[18:35:16] <sshine> caveman, to trust peaks, all you need is an authentication path from some leaf in the MMR. that part is like a Merkle tree.
[18:35:22] <sshine> int-e, hehe :)
[18:35:51] <caveman> sshine: won't that mean, for a new comer, to get all leaves in the past?
[18:37:10] <sshine> caveman, if you have an old set of peaks, and you want to verify the append of a leaf, producing a new set of peaks, you can do that. I'm somehow left with wanting to be able to verify a new set of peaks without all the leaves in-between, but I'm not sure if that makes any sense.
[18:37:40] <caveman> no old peaks = O(n)?
[18:37:44] <sshine> caveman, that does smell like O(n) verification of n added leaves.
[18:38:37] <sshine> caveman, no old peaks: n = 1.
[18:38:56] <caveman> i mean, there is old peaks, it's just that i don't have them. 
[18:43:25] <sshine> so... both a Merkle tree and a MMR aggregate previously hashed results in such a way that you can, for some purposes, do with only the root/peak hashes. if you only have h_1, and you want to get to h_n in less than n hashes, then your hash function must have some property similar to how pow(x,n) = pow(x,n/2)*pow(x,n/2), but I think that's me misunderstanding your constraints.
[18:50:04] *** Parts: gevreeen (~gevreeen@113.102.163.156) (Closing Window)
[18:51:05] <sshine> caveman, you can get a set of peaks from one place, and a leaf hash digest + its authentication path from another place, and verify that the leaf does live underneath the mountain range.

[18:57:15] <sshine> caveman, I'm not sure I understand that sentence.
[19:02:57] <sshine> the wormhole is the Merkle tree authentication path. no need for MMRs. :)
[19:03:04] <sshine> caveman, if you're mostly interested in a proof-of-concept, and not the ability to continuously append to your stream of hashes, you could do this quite easily with only a Merkle tree: computing h_n is done by constructing the Merkle tree.
