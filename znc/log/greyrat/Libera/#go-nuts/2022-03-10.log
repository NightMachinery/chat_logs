[00:01:48] <Mathisen> why would this give me out of range ? https://go.dev/play/p/Zy4jL9EDMqh if change "for i := len(char); i >= 0; i--" to len(char)-1 it works but the first letter is gone.

[00:12:12] <b0nn> I have zero problem with highlighting being a part of the official sites
[00:12:20] <b0nn> Rob Pike, though, does
[00:13:14] <fizzie> `pkg.go.dev` did get a dark theme I think not too long ago.
[00:13:52] <ikke> Mathisen: that's because most programming languages are zero-indexed
[00:14:10] <ikke> So the length itself is not a valid index
[00:14:21] <Mathisen> ok

[00:41:27] <fizzie> Going that way is rather easier, though, since in place of `x` you can just write `x != 0`. The other way around (using a bool as an integer type with a 0/1 value) is less concise.

[01:15:24] *** Joins: todo75 (~todo75@user/todo75)

[01:17:06] <fizzie> What would a slice with an unknown capacity actually mean?
[01:18:21] <Mathisen> my goal is to make a function that takes any int and slices that int so i can easy iterate over it and see if example there is a 0 and remove that from the int
[01:18:30] <Mathisen> bad explanasion maybe but hope you get my point :)

[01:19:16] <Mathisen> no need for the solusion i want to figure that out
[01:20:01] <bpalmer> Mathisen: it sounds like what you're trying to do would work with a normal slice; you can ignore its capacity (the third argument to make)
[01:20:24] <fizzie> Well, anyway. If you don't have any advance information about how long a slice you will eventually need, it's conventional to just start from a nil slice, and build it incrementally with append.

[04:51:48] <fizzie> Yeah, I noticed and wondered about that too. I don't rightly know. I mean, in both cases there's the unnamed template from template.New(""), that's what I imagine the third one is. It gets that name if you change it in New: https://go.dev/play/p/odwWrWJDxBk
[04:52:13] <fizzie> I don't know why it's included in the output of t.Templates() for "html/template" but not for "text/template" though.
[04:53:07] <pjs> is there a reason to use html/template over text/ ? I'm not quite sure what the diff is
[04:53:54] <fizzie> Actually, I guess that's sort of documented, but it doesn't still explain the "why". https://pkg.go.dev/html/template#Template.Templates says: "Templates returns a slice of the templates associated with t, including t itself." https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#Template.Templates says "Templates returns a slice of defined templates associated with t." (But not that "t itself" part.)
[04:55:26] <fizzie> html/template does that thing where it's context-sensitively smart about expanding parameters, so that if you have <p>{{.Foo}}</p> in the template, any <>s in it turn into &lt;&gt;, while if you have <a href="http://example.com/?{{.Foo}}"> all the contents get query-string encoded instead.
[04:55:40] <fizzie> text/template would just plonk in the results of .Foo as-is.

[04:58:09] <pjs> I understand
[04:58:59] <pjs> https://go.dev/play/p/3o7v3Dnqm2N is basically a mirror of my Template struct, shows the same behavior changing test / html. I guess expected.
[05:00:23] <fizzie> I don't know what the .Templates() method is really meant for, other than debugging. Normally you'd look them up by name, after all.

[05:01:35] <pjs> fizzie: thanks as always! It was a big help
[05:04:15] <fizzie> NP. Just as an extra thing (got curious about it), here's a text/template vs. html/template difference-explainer: https://go.dev/play/p/HxzCNDAsnPL

[16:54:42] <siXy> you still get that huge difference without cgo? That's very surprising. The only thing that springs to mind is buildmode=default vs buildmode=pie, but I wouldn't expect the difference between those to be nearly that large.
[16:55:02] <chilversc> well, just updated my local version to 1.17.7, and it's still 3.4M on my machine, so no idea why the other machine is producing a 90M binary
[16:55:18] <siXy> hm, unless one defaults to buildmode=shared, that _might_ do it, but still.
[16:55:29] <chilversc> wouldn't that show up in go env though?

[18:28:34] <chilversc> So anyone got an idea why Ubuntu 20.04 is producing a 3.4M binary, while 21.10 produces a 90M binary? Same source code, same "go env". It seems on 21.10 its including the entirity of the referenced packages (e.g. aws) instead of only the parts that are used.

[19:12:06] <chilversc> ah, seems like it was a bit of a false path, I ran "rm -rf ~/go/pkg/mod" and then re-built on my machine and now my package is also 90M, but I'm not sure why that would be the case?
[19:13:20] <chilversc> The go.mod and go.sum are supposed to keep everything pinned at the correct versions? So why was my build previously 3.4M, but having deleted the pkg/mod its now 90M?
[19:14:00] <chilversc> I did try using "go clean; go clean -cache; go build" previously without re-downloading all the modules

[19:22:44] <siXy> the page on module build sort of implies this? that it'll link to things that are already there, but will otherwise compile into one artifact.
[19:22:58] <siXy> but it could be better spelled out
[19:23:27] <chilversc> so at some point I caused the modules to be pre-compiled, so it was linking rather than including?
[19:23:46] <siXy> I believe so, yeah
[19:23:48] <chilversc> though its odd that I could then copy the 3.4M binary to a remote server and run it

[23:57:47] <pyzozord> fmt.Errorf() doesn't print anything, why?
[23:58:26] <b0nn> it creates an Error struct{}
[23:58:39] <pyzozord> how can i just print to stderr?
[23:58:47] <b0nn> But there's more to your question - which might be helped with some example code
[23:59:00] <ikke> Fprint
[23:59:10] <ikke> to Oos.StdErr
[23:59:17] <ikke> os.StdErr*
