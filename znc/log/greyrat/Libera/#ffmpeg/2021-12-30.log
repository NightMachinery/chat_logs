[03:06:45] <john21> klaxa is this before -i or after?
[03:07:05] <c_14> either works, before is faster
[03:07:44] <klaxa> here is the relevant excerpt from the page i linked: This will be done very slowly, frame by frame. As of FFmpeg 2.1, the main advantage is that when applying filters to the output stream, the timestamps aren't reset prior to filtering (i.e. when ​burning subtitles into a video, you don't need to modify the subtitle timestamps), but the drawback is that it will take a lot of time until it finally reaches that time point.

[15:28:09] <sifby> Let's say I have a m3u8 stream that I want to restream to rtmp. My command then would be
[15:28:09] <sifby> ffmpeg -i https://something.com/stream.m3u8 -c:v copy -c:a aac -ar 44100 -ab 192k -ac 2 -strict -2 -flags +global_header -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -bufsize 3072k -f flv rtmp://somewhere.com/abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop
[15:28:09] <sifby> The only problem is the native stream's audio and video lines are unsynchronised (Video comes way earlier than the audio).
[15:28:09] <sifby> How can I delay the video stream, so it matches with the audio? All the methods I tried seem to work only on files (I even tried live saving to .mkv and streaming that .mkv file with the delay, and it worked, except the quality wasn't that good and the method would break every 3 minutes)

[19:34:08] <luc4> Hello! I'm using libavcodec/libavformat to encode through the hardware decoder. I noticed that even though I send frames that are monotonically increasing, I get packets where pts can decrease. Is this normal?
[19:34:59] <luc4> Do I have to keep a queue and sort those packets myself?
[19:35:16] <JEEB> encoding
[19:35:28] <JEEB> that means that you are getting packets with rising DTS but PTS that can go downwards, right?
[19:35:31] <JEEB> if yes, that is normal
[19:35:34] <JEEB> just B-frames in action
[19:35:58] <JEEB> a later frame gets coded first, and then previous one gets coded after it since that was found to be more optimal
[19:36:11] <JEEB> you should find the same with f.ex. x264
[19:36:40] <derchris> i don't know much about the build process, but there are several what seems to be test build for certain libraries during the configure. i can see some which look to test for libsmbclient

[23:17:23] <biberao> hi
[23:19:40] <LuKaRo> hi!
[23:24:50] <biberao> see if you can help me
[23:25:08] <biberao> https://bpa.st/T4LA
[23:25:28] <LuKaRo> what are you trying to do?
[23:26:07] *** Joins: PocketKiller (PacKetIV@user/packetiv)
[23:28:58] <biberao> i have this mp4 that gives those errors and i wish i could recover it
[23:30:46] <BtbN> looks like a completely busted file to me
[23:31:16] <LuKaRo> What happened to the file?
[23:31:30] <biberao> it was a live stream
[23:31:39] <biberao> but maybe got some error while closing
[23:32:07] <LuKaRo> that's why you should always use mkv whenever you can :)
[23:32:28] <LuKaRo> because mkv is much more resilient against errors like this :)
[23:32:54] <biberao> i see
[23:33:01] <biberao> then ill change
[23:33:19] <biberao> so tell me
[23:33:30] <biberao> is there things i can try to solve it?
[23:34:37] *** Quits: wuxi (~wuxi@61.155.23.114) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:34:55] <LuKaRo> Try playing it with ffplay to make sure any errors are not related to the output format
[23:35:42] <LuKaRo> Otherwise use your favorite web search engine to search for something like "repair mp4"
[23:36:01] <LuKaRo> I've also tried this once, but without great success. Since then, I always make sure to use MKV
[23:36:28] <biberao> LuKaRo:
[23:36:32] <biberao> it plays more stuff
[23:36:37] <biberao> than with vlc and others
[23:36:42] <biberao> could it mean something different?
[23:37:28] <biberao> ok now it encountered a lot of errors
[23:39:32] <tar_xvf> I switched from rendering mp4 videos to mkv because now i encode with lossless h264 and WAV pcm_s24le audio when i upload to youtube :P
[23:40:30] <biberao> nice
[23:40:33] <biberao> i cant get the video back
[23:40:35] <biberao> its private now
[23:40:54] <LuKaRo> The video file works better in ffplay than with vlc?
[23:41:13] <biberao> y
[23:41:13] <biberao> a
[23:41:18] <LuKaRo> If it plays back at least something, you could try to re-encode the file using ffmpeg
[23:41:36] <biberao> it gives a lot fo errors
[23:41:53] <LuKaRo> yeah, but how does the output file look like?
[23:42:06] <LuKaRo> are the errors so bad making viewing impossible?
[23:42:10] <biberao> ya
[23:42:15] <biberao> it fails to convert
[23:42:18] <LuKaRo> ah okay
[23:42:25] <LuKaRo> but playing with ffplay works?
[23:42:40] <biberao> a few seconds

[23:48:11] <LuKaRo> hmm okay
[23:48:18] <LuKaRo> that's a good sign, at least not all hope is lost
[23:48:33] <LuKaRo> But I'm not experienced in recovering such files
[23:48:43] <biberao> thanks

[23:50:02] <biberao> the video is broken
[23:50:03] <biberao> i give up
[23:50:04] <biberao> :\
[23:50:45] <LuKaRo> Yeah, depending on how important this video is to you, you could try to continue asking for help or searching the net :)
[23:51:05] <LuKaRo> There might be tools or ways with ffmpeg to fix this file, but I'm not experienced in that :)
[23:51:18] <biberao> i keep searching
[23:51:20] <biberao> but
[23:51:24] <biberao> havent found it
[23:51:24] <biberao> hehe
