[00:15:41] <CptLuxx> tthe best think Kiernian i still wonder maybe im the retard? and its ok that the infected machine is stil in the network
[00:15:52] <CptLuxx> because this guy really belives it
[00:16:41] <vinrock> well
[00:16:52] <vinrock> you guys are exposed to huge liability rn
[00:17:23] <CptLuxx> we told the customers this loud and clear that this is horrible
[00:17:39] <CptLuxx> but i cant get over the fact that this new young it company things this is ok
[00:18:01] <vinrock> ok so this is a customer of yours (you're an msp) and their own hadware vendor, that has nothing to do with you guys, is the one insisting on keeping the device in prod until friday?
[00:18:16] <CptLuxx> we are the msp
[00:18:18] <vinrock> just makin sure i got the whole picture
[00:18:20] <vinrock> k
[00:18:27] <CptLuxx> one of the employees of the customer went behind our back
[00:18:33] <CptLuxx> and ordered the pbx from another it company
[00:18:33] <vinrock> ohboy
[00:18:34] <CptLuxx> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[00:18:36] <vinrock> ohboy
[00:18:47] <CptLuxx> from random new it company
[00:18:52] <vinrock> so the pbx company, that answers to your cusotmer, is making this cal
[00:18:56] <CptLuxx> the company is max 6 months old.. the boss cant be older then me
[00:19:00] <CptLuxx> and they think this is ok
[00:19:01] <Activ8> https://apple.news/AOQGUcpQIOMGFx0whjNn7sg
[00:19:04] <DrZak> somebody is still using a pbx?
[00:19:05] <CptLuxx> yep
[00:19:11] <vinrock> they're probably trying to cause a shit storm so they can make you look bad and snag your customer
[00:19:20] <CptLuxx> i think the same
[00:19:22] <Activ8> One drive mapping via cmd 
[00:19:25] <vinrock> i bet they have some relation to the guy that called them
[00:19:25] <CptLuxx> but we told the customer loiud and clear
[00:19:27] <CptLuxx> THIS IS BULLSHIT
[00:19:36] <CptLuxx> turn it off now its a big risk
[00:19:42] <CptLuxx> i think the same vinrock!
[00:19:52] <DrZak> its like when buying a car
[00:19:53] <vinrock> you guys need to whip up some sorta legal doc for events like this and get the customer to sign off
[00:20:00] <CptLuxx> yep
[00:20:07] <DrZak> no matter what you tell the wife, the dumb bitch still wants a mini cooper
[00:20:14] <vinrock> lol
[00:20:16] <CptLuxx> i bet... the new it guy will fix it on friday and charge a huge bill for this

[00:33:35] <DrZak> jesus
[00:33:46] <DrZak> it can run i7 with 16gb ram
[00:33:56] <ender> that's the one I have
[00:33:57] <DrZak> it has a serial
[00:33:59] <vinrock> cptluxx you know what i bet you could say to get them to act fast
[00:34:05] <DrZak> holy f ..
[00:34:15] <vinrock> your pbx is now part of a botnet
[00:34:18] <vinrock> what if its a cp botnet
[00:34:21] <vinrock> !!
[00:34:21] <CptLuxx> iI KNOW!
[00:34:23] <CptLuxx> i said that
[00:34:25] <vinrock> wat
[00:34:29] <vinrock> cp didnt even make them budge
[00:34:31] <CptLuxx> i said its connecting to irc
[00:34:34] <CptLuxx> i said all that
[00:34:36] <vinrock> those mfers are on drugs
[00:34:42] <iphone> are you personally liable if your computer is part of a CP botnet?
[00:34:48] <CptLuxx> i said i blocked irc /ssh outgoing
[00:34:53] <Kiernian> oh yeah, as soon as someone says "irc" it's a botnet
[00:35:07] <CptLuxx> they answer me 
[00:35:09] <CptLuxx> """Since I checked the Linux machine, I can say that the machine does not present a threat to the internal network at the moment.
[00:35:09] <CptLuxx> Since you have blocked the external connections for SSH and IRC, you have no problems from this point either."
[00:35:10] <vinrock> im pretty sure if you leave a known infected host on your network, you are majorly liable to everyone and anyone that can claim victimhood
[00:35:12] <CptLuxx> ....
[00:35:21] <DrZak> stylus
[00:35:30] <CptLuxx> its still trying to connect i can see that in new packet captures
[00:35:32] <Kiernian> most workplaces don't block 6667 because they're afraid people will chat. it's how command and control servers monitor stuff
[00:35:35] <vinrock> and blocking stuff is evidence you knew the magnitude of the situation and chose not to act
[00:35:36] <DrZak> thats a cool kut
[00:35:51] <vinrock> but thats where it gets gray since there are three entities involved in this decision making pocess
[00:35:57] <CptLuxx> i mean the code you pasted is pretty old Kiernian
[00:35:59] <DrZak> Kiernian: yea, i had to tunnel to my server using DNS once
[00:36:04] <DrZak> no bueno
[00:36:06] <CptLuxx> i bet the new version can load new stuff as needed
[00:36:18] <CptLuxx> and blocking ssh/irc is NOT enough to keep the attacker out at this point
[00:36:27] <Kiernian> absolutely CptLuxx. it's reporting back everything it sees on t hat network.
[00:36:39] <Kiernian> log4j? deploy log4shell!
[00:36:56] <vinrock> its not‎ his box
[00:37:08] <vinrock> customers decided to do shadow it with another vendor
[00:37:16] <Kiernian> I know, which is the only reason it's still up
[00:37:27] <vinrock> im assuming he cant do shit on the box cuz he has no access
[00:37:31] <CptLuxx> yes
[00:37:41] <mistiry> "oops, we disabled that switch port"
[00:37:41] <CptLuxx> if it was for me i would have fixed it the moment i have seen it
[00:37:42] <Kiernian> and unplugging it would kill the 3cx phone system
[00:37:58] <vinrock> at the fw level id create a rule for that one host specifically placed above all the others so it drops all comms
[00:38:15] <vinrock> sory folks your phones will be back online when the new retard vendor replaces this machine
[00:38:15] <CptLuxx> the firewall there.. is limited..
[00:38:25] <CptLuxx> i can block ports/all but thats it
[00:38:32] <vinrock> what kinda of fw
[00:38:43] <CptLuxx> meh a normal router that is common in germany
[00:38:47] <Kiernian> nah, the vendor would just say "we had it locked down, your phones not working was his fault, not ours" and throw blame
[00:38:48] <vinrock> oh
[00:38:50] <vinrock> a "firewall"
[00:38:51] <CptLuxx> a fortigate was on the way...
[00:39:43] <Kiernian> I'd try blocking all traffic from it to anything but the phone IPs if possible, but I don't know what the setup is
[00:40:01] <CptLuxx> the fact that he things its ok to wait till friday
[00:40:05] <CptLuxx> ????
[00:40:07] <Kiernian> is MESSED UP
[00:40:19] <CptLuxx> this guy isnt much older then me maybe 35
[00:40:24] <mistiry> maybe its HIS botnet

[00:54:39] <signofzeta> ahhhh, good point!
[00:55:03] <Kiernian> the fact that it's set up to scan for things is always a bad sign. it can be set to target all kinds of things after it finds them that way

[01:02:00] <vinrock> ugh this person on reddit is calling a plumber to snake their drain
[01:02:09] <vinrock> just go to home depot and buy the cheap plastic thing
[01:02:11] <vinrock> blammo done
[01:02:31] <vinrock> if you need a big one you can get it at the rental counter
[01:03:27] <signofzeta> or try a bottle of drain cleaner.  it works on mild to moderate clogs
[01:03:33] <signofzeta> better option: eat more fiber.
[01:03:39] <iphone> professional snakes are much better if you have a serious clog
[01:03:47] <Kiernian> drain cleaner bad

[01:04:18] <vinrock> plumbers are mad expensive yo
[01:04:38] <vinrock> only situation i know to use one if when its the main and you have roots or some shit coming in the pipe
[01:04:45] <vinrock> then its not even a normal snake its that rotary thing that busts shit up
[01:04:52] <Kiernian> so is reconstructive surgery if you get an air bubble and splash drain cleaner on your face/eyes
[01:05:08] <vinrock> on a sink you just get the plastic whip thing with the spikes, shove it in, give it some twirls and the pull out a wad of nastiness

[01:06:05] <iphone> I have python3, how does that help me unclog my drain?
[01:06:10] <vinrock> i dont think most people know that water heaters have a sacrificial anode

[01:27:23] <Kiernian> huh. that probably would have needed replacing before we moved in.

[01:29:34] <vinrock> kiernan yes the bottom of your water heater started leaking because of galvanic action due to the lack of sacrificial anode
[01:29:49] <vinrock> the sacrificial anode is there to get eaten away before the water heater itself does
[01:30:09] <vinrock> another thing i tink people arent aware of is the tprv ad that can be dangerous
[01:30:10] <vinrock> so fyi
[01:30:15] <CptLuxx> you have to feed the water ghosts with the anode\
[01:30:21] <CptLuxx> if you dont feed them they eat the heater

[10:25:36] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> @Cl0udNinja I always recommend getting a bunch of credit cards, and not using them, or paying them off in full every single month.
[10:25:36] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> JUST so you have a "history"
[10:26:12] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> I concur, use the cc as your daily driver and pay it off, don't use more money, just the same amount you normally would
[10:26:20] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> i went from like a 600 to a 800 in 2 years
[10:26:50] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> You should really only need credit when getting a house loan, but having good credit when getting a house loan can make a huge difference.
[10:27:01] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> or getting a car
[10:27:27] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> I wouldn't spend too much on a car unless you really like cars.
[10:27:42] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> i mean, i guess that's all relative
[10:28:43] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> It's definitely better debt than persistent credit card debt.
[10:29:29] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> especially if you're getting like sub 2%
[10:30:48] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> But I've seen 18 year olds getting into debt for like a $20,000 car, and I'm like dude, what are you doing?
[10:31:37] <Cl0udNinja> I just dont get loans :P I only buy what I can actually pay for right then and there
[10:31:51] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> yea im one of those irresponsible people, but I kept that car for 16 years before it got totaled, so I guess it worked out
[10:32:44] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> I had a car get totaled like a year after buying it because someone rear ended us, and it's amazing how quickly they're ready to devalue your car. 😆
[10:33:20] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> yea that sucks balls
[10:33:48] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> i got 5.5k on a 16 year old car with 160k miles
[10:33:58] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> as the payout
[10:33:59] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> lol
[10:34:18] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> That's not terrible tbh
[10:34:39] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> It's a great way to live
[10:34:46] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> this is prime for putting everything on credit cards and then paying it off anyway
[10:34:47] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> That's also not terrible
[10:35:27] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> i used to do cash only since i had bad credit, then i rebuilt it, still buying the same way I did before, just have the additional 5% cashback and shit like that
[10:35:43] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> which can add up
[10:35:52] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> I'd make an exception for a house at least, since you're probably not going to save up for that in advance.
[10:36:04] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> But you *could* always rent.
[10:36:43] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> there's an arguement that buying a house is a bad investment and that if you'd dump your down payment into an index that you'd make more than you would if you had sold the house in 5 years
[10:37:08] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> That might be true, but I bet it depends heavily on the area.
[10:37:14] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> probably on the market too lol
[10:39:03] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Even if you never plan to use it, I'd still get the credit card, setup auto-pay in full just in case you *do* ever use it, and then just put it away.
[10:39:03] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> You get "history" just for having it.
[10:39:49] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> None of that annual payment garbage, get like a Discover or a Visa with your local bank.
[10:39:55] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> and the cashback, get the cashback
[10:40:14] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> you can even get like 10% off on top of that by buying gift cards with you rewards points
[10:40:25] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Yeah. If you do use it, and pay it off in full every month, you get paid to use a credit card.
[10:40:43] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> that's what convinced me to get some
[10:41:02] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> you also get bonus' for signing up
[10:41:11] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> so if you put 1k on it in 3 months they give you like 300 bucks for free
[10:41:23] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> it's almost stupid not to take advantage
[10:42:20] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> But they count on being able to sucker some people into persistent debt, so for those who are susceptible to that, it's not as good a deal obviously.
[10:42:26] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> i got the chase freedom flex, i was getting 5% back on groceries for like a whole year, and the times it included groceries I'd get like 9% back
[10:42:34] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> nice
[10:42:35] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> yea
[10:42:51] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> that's the trick, someone else who's irresponsible is paying for your perks
[10:42:57] <sd> 08<W​age Lyfe> don't be that person
[10:44:04] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> They also take cuts from businesses that use their payment network to pay your perks. But someone is getting that money. Might as well be you.

[11:30:01] <Activ8> Another day in paradise.  Let’s see what today brings
[11:31:23] <Kiernian> today brings a former employee cancelling our mailchimp account. I didn't know we HAD a mailchimp account because noone mentioned it during the offboarding, so they also didn't change the credentials.
[11:31:56] <Activ8> There will be a lot of other things you don’t know as well
[11:32:09] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> oof
[11:32:40] <Activ8> What I mean by that is employees do things they either shouldn’t or they don’t say they have done 
[11:32:48] <Activ8> speaking from experience 
[11:33:00] <Kiernian> oh, precisely. Especially anyone involved with any kind of marketing
[11:33:09] <Activ8> Some employees hide things just to be a cunt
[11:33:09] * DoTheNeedful throws punches
[11:33:15] <Kiernian> the only department more likely to have side hustle running outside of company bounds is sales
[11:33:30] <Activ8> nope
[11:34:08] <Activ8> Marketing, IT, Teaching, Sales, Managers they all side hustle 
[11:34:14] <Activ8> mans more and more and more
[11:34:19] <Kiernian> in my experience anyway. I can't count the number of times salespeople have interfaced some third party garbage with their e-mail accounts in order to crawl contacts, etc
[11:34:48] <Kiernian> yeah, I suppose with the whole working from home thing it's becoming a LOT more common
[11:34:55] <Activ8> Ive seen people take contacts when they shouldn’t 
[11:35:16] <Activ8> a ceo asked me one day to back up their contacts so they could take them with her 
[11:36:01] <Activ8> She had something like 500 ceo contacts that’s a cunts move.  Stealing the show.

[12:00:21] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> Can't take any contacts to any other place for about 2 years
[12:02:50] <Kiernian> I always thought that was kinda shady. I mean, it makes sense for contacts you MAKE while working for a given employer, but if you're getting hired based on bringing a bunch of long term relationships WITH you, then if the company screws up enough to make you want to leave, you should get to take what you brought in right back out

[15:22:55] <Kiernian> according to them, they were born in technology, but built for business.
[15:23:26] <rpifan> lol super helpful
[15:23:30] <rpifan> i spoke to two sys admin types
[15:23:34] <rpifan> a dude called mac
[15:23:41] <rpifan> but he didnt seem super experienced
[15:23:55] <rpifan> i heard some doubt and weakness in his voice, using my bene geserit powers of course
[15:24:09] <Kiernian> they look like a consulting firm founded by four dudes from arthur anderson who met at a pub and eventually got around to buying other consulting firms
[15:24:36] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> Probably a buzzword startup
[15:24:45] <Kiernian> they've been around for 20 years

[15:26:03] <rpifan> @mitchy93 thanks that would be realy helpful
[15:26:10] <Kiernian> but yeah, it basically looks like it was founded on the principles of "I bet we could get into this consulting gig and make tons of money for ourselves" then proceeded to hire people who could hire people that know how to hire people who do actual work

[15:42:42] <Kiernian> they almost all kept their old laptops
[15:43:04] <Activ8> disjoin the domain and re-join
[15:43:10] <Activ8> that was temp fix iirc
[15:43:30] <Kiernian> after the timeout hit, we had to rejoin a crapload of laptops on a one-by-one basis because they were still using them...just in secret
[15:43:35] <Activ8> I'm not sure of the perma fix it just disappeared one day for us
[15:44:19] <Kiernian> I've only ever seen it caused by a workstation not contacting a domain controller for a certain number of days
[15:44:33] <xe0n> disjoin and rejoin is not the fix...
[15:44:38] <Activ8> it's a temp fix
[15:44:42] <Activ8> I didn't say it was the fix
[15:44:50] <xe0n> you can fix the trust issues without doing that, and also fix the main issue
[15:44:55] <Activ8> sure
[15:45:09] <Activ8> go on then explain how to fix it without that
[15:45:10] <Kiernian> it'll fix it when someone's had a laptop locked in a drawer for six months and finally powers it up :P Of course, by then it's usually out of AD anyway
[15:45:20] <xe0n> what...
[15:45:37] <xe0n> why would the computer object be removed...
[15:45:37] <Activ8> explain if it's not to rejoin to the domain
[15:45:38] <xe0n> lol
[15:45:45] <Activ8> in our case it wasn't removed
[15:45:48] <Activ8> it was dropping 
[15:45:55] <xe0n> it's the computer object password
[15:45:59] <Kiernian> yeah, ignore me, I was reminiscing
[15:46:01] <xe0n> run the cmdlet to reset the computer object password...
[15:46:12] <xe0n> and then run the cmdlet on the pc, fixed.

[20:49:25] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!

[21:22:33] <DrZak> a lot of those things are ms internal
[21:22:45] <DrZak> why would you care about those?

[21:24:15] <vinrock> so far sounds like its the aio
[21:24:19] <int0x1C8> I think the MFP's SMTP client auth is wrong

[21:25:42] <Oliber> if the auth is wrong, it shouldn't ever get there; i'd have a look at the recieve connector logs to see if it's rate limiting for some reason

[21:26:28] <int0x1C8> the printer doesn't log that

[23:41:11] <int0x1C8> you probably do, I have DSPS
[23:41:54] <int0x1C8> did an overnight sleep study when I was in college
[23:41:59] <sd> 02<M​itchy93> Should I go to bed earlier and wake up at the same time? I still get 8 hours sleep

[23:42:40] <int0x1C8> wow
[23:43:26] <int0x1C8> the only thing you can really control with DSPS is when you wake up, so forcing yourself to wake up at close to the same time everyday helps alleviate a lot of it
[23:44:27] <int0x1C8> I have trouble sleeping in on the weekends since I wake up naturally at 7:20 every morning now
[23:44:35] <int0x1C8> kinda sucks, but
