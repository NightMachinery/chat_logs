[14:45:21] *** Joins: TempIRCLogger (~RakuIRC@ipv4-wenzperl.connected.by.freedominter.net)
[14:45:47] <lizmat> you mean something like Rational[Int,Int] ?
[14:46:04] <moritz> my knowledge of haskell is pretty rusty and incomplete, but I think roles are the closes thing in raku
[14:46:10] <moritz> and those can be parameterized
[14:46:35] <moritz> though in general, my feeling is that if you want to super-strong typing (a la haskell), raku is going to disappoint you
[14:51:45] <wanko> oh, I think I see, thanks both of you. so Rational takes 2 parameters and by doing class Positive does Rational[UInt] you basically supply Positive as the second argument, right?

[14:52:39] <moritz> not quite
[14:52:58] <moritz> Rational wants two parameters, so trying to write Rational[UInt] is an error
[14:53:30] <moritz> (ok, Rational has a default, iirc, so it's not actually an error, but if there was no default...)
[14:54:41] <moritz> (just to be clear, a Rational in raku is a fraction of two integers)
[14:58:42] <wanko> I think I get it now, thank you!
[15:21:40] <SmokeMachine_> Hi you all! I have a question: Match objects has submaches that you can access as $match<submatch>, isnât it an Associative way of accessing/storing it? So, wouldnât it make sense to Match âdoesâ Associative?

[16:24:11] <moritz> SmokeMachine_: Match used to be Associative when I was last very active in raku land, so it has changed since then
[16:24:44] <moritz> maybe because Associative has certain expectations of what happens if you call .list, which clash with the expectations of the Positional aspects

[19:58:10] <Xliff> If I have an arbitrary prefix string, that may change. How can I use a regular expression to match any character up to that string?
[19:58:14] <Xliff> So....

[20:04:14] <moritz> .*? <?before $string>
[20:04:33] <Xliff> moritz++!
[20:07:19] <Xliff> Is there a way to do that where "$string" is a scalar or an array? Or is that what you meant by "$string"?
[20:14:11] <Xliff> Moritz: So something like this seems to work: https://replit.com/@Xliff/GiantChocolateSpools#main.raku

[23:46:54] <MasterDuke> Altai-man and timo are also involved with comma development
[23:48:44] * Altai-man thinks what to do
[23:51:47] <Altai-man> Shaeto, hi. Alas, it's a known problem, for the time being it's not possible to build an OSX build for the latest version. Tomorrow I'll update the link to download 7.0 instead, I guess. It goes with some unfortunate bugs, so I am not sure what's the best way to proceed.
[23:52:24] <Shaeto> Altai-man: thank you!
[23:52:37] <Altai-man> I can ship the buggy 7.0 for OSX or we can wait some days until it'll be possible to ship 7.1 properly.
[23:53:06] <Shaeto> stable 7.1 is more interesting :)
