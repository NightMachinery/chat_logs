[05:27:22] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: He might have an evil twin. :)
[05:31:10] <rawtaz> yes
[05:41:53] <kwilczynski> You can't sleep?
[05:43:30] <rawtaz> i should be sleeping since a few hours
[05:44:47] <kwilczynski> :)
[05:44:50] <rawtaz> but fuck me, im trying to figure out why docker-compose doesnt remove all capabilities from the container when i have specified    cap_drop:\n  ALL   in the compose file. i know it reads it because it complains if i change it to e.g. ALLFOO (says its an invalid name or so). but the software in the container, running as a regular user, can listen on its port 443 and 80 regardless.
[05:45:06] <kwilczynski> Ahh, awww.
[05:45:09] <kwilczynski> Containers.
[05:45:12] <kwilczynski> Vile things.
[05:45:20] <rawtaz> and i dont get why. that port should not be allowed to bund to if i cropped all capabilities, and didnt add the NET_BIND_SERVICE one
[05:45:21] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Tell me my dear insomniac.
[05:45:26] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: How fast do you type?
[05:45:44] <rawtaz> not very fast, i guess 3 on a scale of 4 where 4 is faaaast
[05:45:58] <rawtaz> im on qwerty as well so..
[05:47:21] <kwilczynski> Ahh hmm.
[05:47:23] <kwilczynski> I see.
[05:47:28] <rawtaz> you?
[05:47:34] <kwilczynski> qwerty
[05:47:42] <kwilczynski> That's so 1990
[05:47:50] <kwilczynski> (I am just totally joking)
[05:48:02] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I am on normal qwerty.
[05:48:09] <kwilczynski> 60% keyboard nowadays .
[05:48:14] <rawtaz> i actually learnt svorak but hit a problem where i couldnt use it in my IDE i used at the time, so i never took off with it :(
[05:48:19] <kwilczynski> The reason why I am asking is because there is this thing...
[05:48:23] <kwilczynski> I heard few times.
[05:48:26] <rawtaz> a THING
[05:48:30] <kwilczynski> Yes.
[05:48:32] <kwilczynski> One of the these.
[05:48:53] <kwilczynski> So allegedly.
[05:49:09] <kwilczynski> As per what the FAANGs and San Francisco boys perpetuate.
[05:49:15] <kwilczynski> Engineers who type slow are... bad.
[05:49:26] <kwilczynski> YOU MUST TYPE SUPER FAST TO BE GOOD ENGINEER
[05:49:31] <kwilczynski> So, I've been wondering.
[05:53:37] <rawtaz> i feel pretty confident im a good engineer then :)
[05:53:45] <rawtaz> or well, pretty good at least
[05:54:48] <rawtaz> honestly there's probably SOME relation between the speed of typing and how good of an engineer you are, in most cases (i mean besides the ones that are just off but think savant-smart, and those that have a physical [dis]ability affecting their typing speed)
[06:29:29] <kwilczynski> Ah.
[06:29:45] <kwilczynski> I will so inadequate with my less than 150 WPM typing speed.
[06:30:04] <kwilczynski> Might explain why I am not working for Google yet.
[06:35:28] <rawtaz> isnt that pretty fast?
[06:35:35] <rawtaz> isnt like really fast something like 180 WPM?
[06:36:32] <rawtaz> also, can you tell me how given the !cap_net_bind_service and all other caps being inactive (!) in https://kopy.io/KgY9i its possible that traefik happily binds to port 80 and 443 and responds on it when i try it from the outside world?
[06:37:41] <rawtaz> ive been on this issue for like three or four hours now. its sily
[06:37:45] <rawtaz> silly :(
[06:37:53] <rawtaz> how the fuck can this not work as advertized in teh docs
[06:39:19] <rawtaz> its 4am , i just have to give up for today
[06:57:45] <rawtaz> nite
[06:57:47] * rawtaz &
[06:57:49] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I will look later.
[06:57:55] <kwilczynski> In bed now :/
[06:58:05] <kwilczynski> Wife got angry I make noise.
[06:58:07] <kwilczynski> :)

[16:37:26] <Dus10> I am just trying to find the documentation for the Terraform tasks...
[16:37:33] <Dus10> I can't even find the documentation
[16:38:25] *** Joins: shad (~shad@user/shad)
[16:39:19] <kwilczynski> Welcome to DevOps, Neo.
[16:39:20] <kwilczynski> :)
[16:39:35] <Dus10> haha
[16:39:36] <kwilczynski> If you were taken the blue pill, then Alpacas farming. Nice an easy.
[16:41:05] <Dus10> I am going through a recent Ned Bellavance video and he is talking about what happens when running 'fmt' in the TerraformCLI@0 task
[16:41:13] <Dus10> I was like "nice, where can I learn more?"
[16:41:18] <Dus10> nowhere, apparently
[16:41:19] <kwilczynski> Dus10: https://github.com/charleszipp/azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform
[16:41:26] <kwilczynski> Read the Source, Luke.
[16:41:32] <Dus10> well, that was part of my problem
[16:41:45] <Dus10> how do I know which task is attributed to whom?
[16:41:51] <Dus10> I cannot even find that in the docs
[16:42:03] <kwilczynski> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charleszipp.azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform
[16:42:14] <Dus10> I figured it was this one: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks
[16:42:19] <kwilczynski> This az thez offialz onez.
[16:42:45] <kwilczynski> Well.
[16:42:52] <kwilczynski> Let's face it.
[16:43:04] <kwilczynski> Microsoft sucks. So their own task would suck too.
[16:43:05] <kwilczynski> Ergo.
[16:43:14] <kwilczynski> I used my impeccable logic here.
[16:43:14] <kwilczynski> :P
[16:43:28] <kwilczynski> (just joking of course)
[16:43:36] <kwilczynski> Dus10: The one I linked to is something I sued.
[16:43:38] <kwilczynski> used*
[16:43:51] <kwilczynski> Not sure if it would work for you.
[16:44:35] <kwilczynski> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/best-practices-integration-testing
[16:44:44] <kwilczynski> Official documentation also uses it.
[16:45:02] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Now. That be $500 for the consulting fee. I will send you invoice later. :)
[16:45:25] <Dus10> I'll keep an eye open for it :)
[16:45:25] <Dus10> thanks, btw
[16:45:42] <kwilczynski> No worries Sir. :)
[16:46:28] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Now, something for the soul: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPBRfWAbf7E&t=251s
[16:46:51] <Dus10> Unfortunately, I am a program, so I have no soul
[16:47:38] <kwilczynski> Nonsense!
[16:47:44] <kwilczynski> Ghost in the Machine and such!
[16:47:48] <kwilczynski> ;D
[16:47:59] <Dus10> well, I am sure that applies to some machines
[16:48:06] <Dus10> but not abominations
[16:48:18] <kwilczynski> :(
[16:48:20] <kwilczynski> So harsh.
[16:48:27] <kwilczynski> Dus10: How's the hiring going on?
[16:48:41] <Dus10> slow
[16:48:55] <Dus10> we had an interview planned for Monday, but we had to push it back to tomorrow
[16:49:04] <Dus10> one of two candidates that we found
[16:49:30] <kwilczynski> Me! Me! Hire me!
[16:49:30] <Dus10> ah, kwilczynski, that is good
[16:49:32] <kwilczynski> ;D
[16:49:43] <kwilczynski> I offer plenty of cheeky jokes.
[16:49:45] <Dus10> I wonder if it is included in the Apple Music subscription
[16:49:47] <kwilczynski> Advice nobody needs.
[16:49:49] <kwilczynski> And such.
[16:49:59] <Dus10> well, as of right now, you would have to live in the US
[16:50:06] <Dus10> that might be able to change soon
[16:50:19] <kwilczynski> I can...
[16:50:22] <kwilczynski> Pretend.
[16:50:30] <kwilczynski> Give me some hints.
[16:50:45] <Dus10> it is really messed up... we have a Euro subsidiary, but we never do any work that spans to them
[16:50:51] <kwilczynski> Should I be more Republican or Democrat to get the job?
[16:50:52] <kwilczynski> ;]
[16:51:00] <Dus10> haha
[16:51:21] <kwilczynski> :>
[16:51:39] <Dus10> transcend politics... consider it beneath you and treat any political opinions that you hear with condescension 
[16:51:55] <kwilczynski> Oh sure.
[16:51:57] <kwilczynski> It's not for us.
[16:52:04] <kwilczynski> It's for the boss.
[16:52:12] <kwilczynski> I am sure he is some old geezer Boomer.
[16:52:12] <kwilczynski> ;]
[16:52:20] <Dus10> a blend of sarcasm and contradicting compassion helps :)
[16:52:30] <Dus10> hard to articulate how it works
[16:52:35] <kwilczynski> Right.
[16:53:36] <Dus10> oh, nice... it is available in the subscription
[16:53:46] <kwilczynski> One has to keep the balance in the US.
[16:53:47] <kwilczynski> So.
[16:53:48] <Dus10> added to my library
[16:53:51] <kwilczynski> Sarcasm - got it.
[16:53:57] <kwilczynski> Contradictions...
[16:54:03] <kwilczynski> Got it!
[16:54:14] <kwilczynski> I need to blab about flat Earth and anti-vaccination!
[16:54:50] <Dus10> well, it depends on where the job requisition comes from
[16:54:55] <kwilczynski> While standing in the middle of the Castro St. in MTV.
[16:55:11] <kwilczynski> While complaining that my highly paid job at FAANG is oppressing my views.
[16:55:13] <Dus10> if it is from the original company as of pre-June 2020, you can't be anti-vax
[16:55:14] <kwilczynski> ;D
[16:55:29] <Dus10> if it is from the company we acquired in June 2020, you must be anti-vax
[16:55:34] <kwilczynski> Ah.
[16:55:35] <kwilczynski> I see.
[16:55:45] <kwilczynski> This is challenging.
[16:55:49] <kwilczynski> This blending in as American.
[16:56:13] <kwilczynski> Too many variables to consider. My head spins.
[16:56:38] <Dus10> folks from that company are filing a class action lawsuit against us because of the federal vaccine mandate
[16:56:43] <Dus10> just makes my head hurt
[16:56:47] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Anyway. How does the job market looks like in IT? Any problems because of pandemic?
[16:56:51] <Dus10> ...the lack of logic behind it
[16:56:58] <kwilczynski> Dus10: ... you...
[16:57:03] <kwilczynski> Are you being serious?
[16:57:23] <Dus10> everything I hear about the job market is that it is really good unless you're on the hiring end :)
[16:57:33] <kwilczynski> What's a hiring end?
[16:57:34] <kwilczynski> ;]
[16:57:46] <Dus10> like I am now, trying to find people
[16:57:55] <Dus10> the job market sucks from that perspective
[16:58:12] <kwilczynski> Ah.
[16:58:15] <Dus10> but if you're seeking a job, it is supposed to be a great time
[16:58:21] <kwilczynski> I tell you.
[16:58:26] <kwilczynski> Hire cheap labour from Europe ;]
[16:58:30] <kwilczynski> ;p
[16:58:39] <Dus10> what I have seen suggests that it may not be true
[16:58:52] <kwilczynski> It's not a great time.
[16:59:01] <kwilczynski> A company recently put me through a month long process.
[16:59:07] <kwilczynski> 8 interviews, 90 min on average.
[16:59:17] <Dus10> I have recruiters and hiring managers reaching out to me and they expect me to consider jobs that are completely not right based on my skillset and aren't entertaining my salary requirements
[16:59:38] <kwilczynski> And then realised at the very end "oh, sorry, we can't actually hire in Europe; kthnx bye."
[16:59:46] <kwilczynski> It's a full time job to look for a job nowadays.
[16:59:48] <Dus10> oh shit... that sucks
[16:59:51] <Dus10> what a waste of time
[17:00:13] <Dus10> I can see if our Euro subsidiary has anything
[17:00:29] <kwilczynski> No worries.
[17:00:30] <Dus10> I am supposed to meet with my counterpart in the UK sometime this week or next... but I doubt it is happening
[17:00:31] <kwilczynski> I have no skills.
[17:00:37] <kwilczynski> Nobody wants to hire me :)
[17:00:44] <Dus10> "I am available up to Noon your time!" He tells me...
[17:00:54] <kwilczynski> Night Owl.
[17:00:58] <kwilczynski> ;p
[17:01:07] <Dus10> I look at his calendar... nope, he is definitely not available for the hours before Noon for the next few weeks
[17:01:38] <kwilczynski> UK... the Isla de Brexit.
[17:01:55] <kwilczynski> Dus10: How does the saying go?
[17:01:59] <kwilczynski> Never trust the Englishman? :)
[17:02:00] <kwilczynski> :P
[17:02:06] <Dus10> haha
[17:02:46] <Dus10> yeah, I have been thinking for years that I would like to find a job in Europe for 6 months to two years, at some point...
[17:02:57] <Dus10> looking at the market, it is going to have to wait until I can retire
[17:02:57] <kwilczynski> I am sure Aussies have version that includes more profanities. :)
[17:03:12] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Europe pays badly.
[17:03:15] <Dus10> the pay difference is so massive
[17:03:21] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Not sure if this would be something you'd be happy about.
[17:03:34] <Dus10> I was thinking some Germanic speaking place
[17:03:47] <kwilczynski> I don't recommend.
[17:03:51] <Dus10> but not Britannia
[17:03:52] <kwilczynski> I hated my two years stint in Berlin.
[17:04:07] <Dus10> well, I don't think I would enjoy Berlin either
[17:04:17] <Dus10> Munich, maybe
[17:04:20] <Dus10> Zurich, maybe
[17:04:28] <Dus10> Bergen in Norway, perhaps
[17:04:31] <Dus10> Amsterdam
[17:04:38] <Dus10> Vaduz :)
[17:04:41] <kwilczynski> Amsterdam is overcrowded.
[17:04:44] <kwilczynski> Expensive as hell.
[17:04:49] <Dus10> certainly
[17:04:56] <kwilczynski> Norway is so boring.
[17:05:02] <kwilczynski> You'd become an alcoholic soon.
[17:05:04] <kwilczynski> Trust me.
[17:05:04] <Dus10> I just had someone reach out about a job in Amsterdam
[17:05:09] <kwilczynski> Then leave IT.
[17:05:13] <Dus10> they wanted to pay me $17/hr equivalent...
[17:05:14] <kwilczynski> Grow a beard.
[17:05:16] <Dus10> not thanks
[17:05:22] <kwilczynski> Viking tattos
[17:05:30] <kwilczynski> And join oil rig workforce
[17:05:31] <kwilczynski> ;/
[17:05:32] <Dus10> I like boring places
[17:05:38] <Dus10> I have the beard already
[17:05:46] <kwilczynski> OK.
[17:05:51] <kwilczynski> You are half-way there then.
[17:05:51] <kwilczynski> ;]
[17:05:55] <Dus10> I want Viking tattoos... but here in the US they are associated with unsavory peoples
[17:06:13] <Dus10> so, sadly, no
[17:06:14] <kwilczynski> Dus10: You can go with Hello Kitty.
[17:06:19] <Dus10> haha
[17:06:29] <kwilczynski> But that might be looked awkwardly upon in Norway.
[17:06:29] <kwilczynski> :)
[17:06:41] <kwilczynski> Kitty-Viking.
[17:06:42] <kwilczynski> Maybe...
[17:06:43] <kwilczynski> Maybe.
[17:06:48] <Dus10> I wouldn't mind just running into the wilderness and building or squatting in a cabin on a fjord
[17:06:48] <kwilczynski> ;)
[17:06:54] <kwilczynski> Ahh
[17:07:01] <Dus10> chop firewood and fish by day
[17:07:07] <kwilczynski> You need no Norway for that
[17:07:10] <kwilczynski> Go Alaska!
[17:07:21] <Dus10> drink by the fire by night and hang out with my Norwegian wife
[17:07:30] <kwilczynski> Sasquatchchan
[17:07:34] <kwilczynski> Oh how you spell this.
[17:07:43] <kwilczynski> Yeah.
[17:07:43] <Dus10> I guess I can just settle with hanging out with my Norwegian wife here :)
[17:07:59] <kwilczynski> You can totally run but naked in -30 C in Alaska chasing after some wolf pack.
[17:08:00] <kwilczynski> ;)
[17:08:11] <Dus10> she has all of those common Scandanavian ailments, though
[17:08:17] <kwilczynski> Like?
[17:08:25] <kwilczynski> Carries an axe?
[17:08:26] <kwilczynski> ;D
[17:08:29] <Dus10> autoimmune issues
[17:08:33] <kwilczynski> Ahh ;/
[17:08:35] <kwilczynski> Really?
[17:08:40] <Dus10> yeah
[17:08:42] <kwilczynski> :(
[17:08:52] <Dus10> she is a klutz, too
[17:08:52] <kwilczynski> Then Norway would be better than Alaska.
[17:08:58] <kwilczynski> Good medical care.
[17:09:00] <kwilczynski> Cheaper.
[17:09:05] <kwilczynski> (free?)
[17:09:10] <Dus10> well, it is exists, even
[17:09:18] <Dus10> in Alaska, you might be too far from anything
[17:09:49] <kwilczynski> Norway.
[17:09:51] <kwilczynski> Hmm.
[17:10:08] <Dus10> I dunno, we'll see
[17:10:11] <kwilczynski> No worries.
[17:10:13] <Dus10> still a few years away
[17:10:19] <kwilczynski> I am heading back to Japan in ~6 months time.
[17:10:20] <kwilczynski> :)
[17:10:33] <Dus10> where do you go in Japan?
[17:11:05] <kwilczynski> I would like to settle in Fukuoka
[17:11:11] <kwilczynski> But Tokyo will win, sadly.
[17:11:13] <kwilczynski> Work is there.
[17:11:39] <Dus10> will you stay in one of those sleeping pods?
[17:11:45] <Dus10> has to be rather expensive there, too
[17:12:02] <kwilczynski> Just rent an apartment :)
[17:12:29] <kwilczynski> My family lives there.
[17:13:15] <kwilczynski> And I miss JP too. :)
