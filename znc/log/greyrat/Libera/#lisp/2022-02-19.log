[05:21:55] <blacked> as there are many many many dialects of lisp
[05:22:01] <blacked> what should i learn?
[05:22:04] <blacked> `Common Lisp` vs `Scheme` vs `Guile` ??
[05:22:10] <blacked> which one is faster?
[05:22:52] <blacked> which one have more stable libraries, good, more people support?
[05:22:53] <sm2n> what do you want to get out of it?
[05:22:58] <blacked> which one is actually lisp ?
[05:23:09] <sm2n> Probably Common Lisp then (for the things you stated)
[05:23:10] <blacked> sm2n i dont know
[05:23:18] <blacked> common lisp
[05:23:21] <sm2n> and asking what is "actually lisp" is not a good question
[05:23:43] <sm2n> there is no conclusive thing saying what lisp actually is
[05:23:58] <blacked> i heard there was war betn scheme and common lisp?
[05:24:29] <sm2n> in the 80s maybe
[05:26:06] <blacked> sm2n what language is you are using mostly in lisp familY?
[05:27:07] <sm2n> I tend to prefer CL

[06:02:34] <phadthai> if you decide to try it, a good cl feature is interactive prototyping, i.e. it has among others the defvar/defparameter distinction allowing to reload and recompile parts in a live image (and a new function or its new version can be applied in the image from emacs), for some applications it's quite nice... an example, I'm recently toying with a custom terminal emulator in C then realize that to 
[06:02:40] <phadthai> interactively test changes it'll be useful to be able to change/add behavior without needing to reconnect/restart applications in the pty/tty prototype... with C to do that I'd have to embed some interpreter or to reload modules (which if I use ECL, can do just that transparently)

[06:10:28] <phadthai> scheme is a smaller language in general so can be very nice embedded in other applications, it was one of the inspirations for javascript

[11:37:55] <kiki_lamb> Last commit 6 months ago, and two contributors on the git repo. :/ The boss is gonna be a responsible business-minded type, it's gonna be tough to sell him on something with infrequent updates and few contributors :/
[11:39:30] <moon-child> 6 months is not a very long time
[11:39:33] <contrapunctus> kiki_lamb: that's most Lisp projects and libraries, unfortunately, especially relatively unpopular ones. My personal definition of "maintained" for Lisp projects is "received commits in the past 1 year" 😄️
[11:40:46] <kiki_lamb> It's just kind of frustrating the way things are right now: we're demanding too much of data-centric languages like YAML/JSON, we ~should~ be using some sort of DSL... I can easily imagine implementing a suitable DSL in a Lisp, but now I have to write this whole awkward and inconvenient translation into an intermediary language.
[11:42:27] <kiki_lamb> When I'm usually the one who has to write both sides of the translation, it just seems like I'm wasting my own time.
[11:43:56] <contrapunctus> kiki_lamb: on the brighter side, someone making use of any of these projects would probably contribute some patches and fixes - improvements for others, and also a sign for other people to use/contribute to it. (But you did say you have to sell your boss on the idea...)
[11:50:47] *** Quits: ed (~ed@115.132.140.246) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[11:50:49] <kiki_lamb> Yeah... it's hard to blame him too harshly, he just wants to stick to well-supported tools. :/ Makes some sense, it's potentially easier to hire people familiar with them.
[11:53:12] *** Quits: letto2 (~letto@188.26.152.131) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[11:53:42] <jackdaniel> perhaps if you had contacted authors and made a contract to maintain software fir money then the chosen clr bridge would be better maintained
[11:54:16] <kiki_lamb> I'd just be able to work a lot faster if I could skip this extra step, and have the C# app directly interpret files in an S-exp format, instead of wasting all this extra time awkwardly converting into an intermediary language.
[11:54:25] <jackdaniel> I think that this is not unreasonable for a commercial product managament
[11:54:40] <kiki_lamb> Heh, I'm not the one in charge of contracts.
[11:55:42] <jackdaniel> yes, but you may suggest that - if that would make your life easier then it is no differebt than buying jetbrains license
[12:03:44] *** Joins: yoonkn (~user@175.197.208.79)
[12:06:46] <kiki_lamb> Well... a Jetbrains license is some low three figure number, that's probably much cheaper than paying a team of people with salaries similar to mine to build a CLR Lisp. :/
[12:14:44] <jackdaniel> I thought that we talk about the existing library maintanence
[12:15:07] <jackdaniel> and the fact that it is a stagnantware is a concern
[12:17:26] <kiki_lamb> Sure - the boss is gonna want something he can trust will continue to be well supported in the future, so it's going to be easier to sell something that has frequnt upadates from many contributors.
[12:20:09] * jackdaniel quietly sighs suspecting that he can't effectively communicate the idea he had in mind
[12:20:54] <kiki_lamb> Well, no, blame me... I might have missed the point.
[12:21:48] <kiki_lamb> I just wanna be able to defeat the 'bus factor'... 
[12:22:44] <jackdaniel> if the project has financial backing of a company that uses it it is more likely to be maintained
[12:23:14] *** Quits: tripfandango (~tripfanda@2a00:a040:19e:72a1:2d85:d178:746e:2777) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:23:18] <jackdaniel> maintained software improves with time and gains contributors (financial or develeopment wise)
[12:23:27] <kiki_lamb> yeh :/ it's surprising no other company has done that... we're not really in the position to be that company.
[12:24:29] <jackdaniel> in other words software without commercial support (man hours wise or dollar wise) is nit a reliable dependency for a commercial entity
[12:24:53] *** Joins: tripfandango (~tripfanda@77.137.65.104)
[12:25:45] <jackdaniel> well, it is as in this picture on xkcd - multibillion companies having critical dependencies on hobby projects ;)
[12:26:43] <jackdaniel> but then it is no surprise that when the hobby interest withers libraries become unmaintained
[12:26:45] <kiki_lamb> Yeah. :/ We're not in the position to back such a project financially, we're small but not new...
[12:27:31] <jackdaniel> well, at least I now feel that I have communicated the idea ;)
[12:28:03] <jackdaniel> time to spend some time with my family - see you later \o
[12:28:59] <kiki_lamb> It's me, the boss, and like four junior devs that we direct, with another half dozen people doing sales/accounting... we can keep going just fine in a fairly specialized industry, but we can't chuck 5 figures at someone to maintain a Lisp for us.
[12:29:40] <kiki_lamb> jackdaniel: later, thanks for the chatter!
