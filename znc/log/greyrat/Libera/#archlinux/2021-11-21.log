[01:22:13] <MrElendig> check what the power button sends?
[01:22:26] <MrElendig> if anything
[01:23:14] <arseru> I'm reading in https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nextcloud#Desktop that in order to achieve auto-login, I should only need `qtkeychain-qt5`: "To achieve auto-login when the client starts, one of optional dependencies of qtkeychain should be installed as well."
[01:23:15] <phrik> Title: Nextcloud - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[01:23:28] <arseru> which optional dep is it talking about? kwallet? libsecret?
[01:24:18] <thecloud1> MrElendig: is there a command to see which session managers are running?
[01:24:40] <arseru> oh I get it now, I have libsecret backend instead of kwallet, so I should have a service compatible with it, i.e. gnome-keyring, so I'll just install that and be done with this :P

I do finish arch installation install grub as --removable and as a first boot everything is fine. As soon as I start windows, my USB can't boot anymore like grub missing because if i reinstall grub it works for first boot again. Tried bios and UEFI both same. So is there a way so windows don't destroy it?

[07:38:22] <kulak> I think you are correct. It is not a big deal for me to boot into windows when I decide to game.  But it is the only thing I do in Windows.
[07:38:37] <Dan39> the dxvk page says 'Verify that your application uses DXVK instead of wined3d by checking for the presence of the log file d3d9.log or d3d11.log in the application's directory, or by enabling the HUD (see notes below).'  to turn on the HUd you just add env var DXVK_HUD=1
[07:39:03] <Dan39> kulak:  well if it launches and runs well from Steam, what's the issue? are you getting poor performance or something?
[07:39:53] <kulak> World of tanks runs on steam with reduced color and performance, but when I load Windows it runs nice.

[07:41:29] <kulak> color is so bad it feels like it uses only 16 colors.  performance: refresh can be really slow

[08:12:40] <NetSysFire> if you dont update (as in software, not hardware because this is what dmc meant) frequently you will have major problems though
[08:13:00] <Dan39> is that what they meant? LOL
[08:13:19] <NetSysFire> pretty sure
[08:13:42] <NetSysFire> because hardware wise, yeah you very rarely need to update
[08:13:50] <NetSysFire> the last update was the 32 bit deprecation

[16:34:33] <Scisista> the Wi-Fi speed is incredibly slow for some reason
[16:34:44] <Golui> Guess I'll just protect the UEFO with a password and call it a day.
[16:34:45] <NetSysFire> Golui: might be achievable with an igpu
[16:34:58] <NetSysFire> because for some reason it doesnt require an oprom?
[16:35:14] <NetSysFire> this is dark firmware magic. i have no idea either
[16:35:46] <Foxboron> Golui: you can enroll the checksums from the TPM eventlog into the db. I have code for that for sbctl
[16:35:51] <Foxboron> It would be experimental though
[16:36:16] <Golui> As long as I don't brick anything I'm fine with experimental
[16:36:28] <Foxboron> I can't guarantee it wont brick in the future
[16:36:38] <Foxboron> if you want !brick then you need to just keep the microsoft certs there
