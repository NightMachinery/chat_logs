[00:59:12] <RedNifre> Last time I was using java it was all invariant on type parameters, but inheritance based on kind * types, so it should be possible to pass a String for an Object, but not a List<String> for a List<Object>, but a String[] for Object[] for reasons.

[03:32:32] <quazimod1> if you keep your application & business logic separate you are going to have a better time
[03:32:45] <quazimod1> depending on how your api actually works that could be easier or harder

[03:34:34] <quazimod1> if you have some sort of entry path into the business logic that is separate from the api layer code then you will probably find it easier to reuse code for private & b2b APIs while keeping the actual APIs separate
[03:35:15] <quazimod1> another thing that we do is 'request diffing' where request/responses to each API is saved & diffed between deployments to ensure that a change to one wont make a change to another, and so on
[03:35:40] <quazimod1> ofc you need to stub/mock absolutely anything variable in that case - we use ruby so we actually stub all sources of nondeterminism as well as time, for those tests

[04:41:14] <InPhase> Sliding window is simplest to do with ring buffer, where when you replace the each element around the loop you subtract the removed and add the new to the total.  Another good averaging function is exponential averaging where you multiply the total by (N-1)/N before adding on the next element, where N starts at 1 for the first element and rises by 1 more for each iteration until reaching the 
[04:41:20] <InPhase> averaging scale desired, and the total is divided by N to get the average.
[04:41:32] <Decker> I'm not reallly sure how much 'work' should be done to make it hard... any single solution is unique ... and any other valid solution (even if more ... rare) is a different solution, it's not like you have any better odds of modifying the record and generating the same solution

This is a little more cumbersome with sliding window.  You might find this beneficial if you want the fps update time to scale with the fps so that it is time locked and not

[05:07:13] <InPhase> smallville7123: Another way to do it with fps that's unique to fps, and not generalizable, is to store the last N timestamps in a ring buffer, and calculate N-frames per second, then divide by N.  Similar logic to the sliding window, but a little simplified.

[05:57:20] <smallville7123> what im trying to get is accurate FPS readings with account for time drift due to paused/prolonged rendering (eg if a frame takes signifigantly longer to render than usual, or if the application gets paused by the OS)

[05:58:19] <smallville7123> (eg rendering might be paused while the app is completely obscured by another opaque window) *
[06:00:08] <flakonium_tubes> so like, sampletime / sampleframes ?
[06:00:44] <smallville7123> (eg if a frame takes signifigantly longer to render than usual, or if the application gets paused by the OS, eg rendering might be paused while the app is completely obscured by another opaque window, or while a resize event is in progress and it is taking signifigantly long to complete within an acceptable time, eg longer than 16.333 ms)  *
[06:00:52] <InPhase> smallville7123: Note that if you're doing this for debugging or analysis of issues, what you actually want is a time delta histogram, because the tails are VERY important when it comes to tracking issues.  So you want to see where the bulk of things are, but you also want visibility of the lag issues, and a histogram gives you both.
[06:01:03] <vdamewood> I think it's time for a massive salad.
[06:01:31] <smallville7123> InPhase: how might that work?
[06:02:41] <InPhase> smallville7123: You just make a vector with each element representing a time delta range, zero it, and add 1 every time a time delta falls into a particular defined range.
[06:03:27] <InPhase> smallville7123: Then you output it at the end, and plot it to see what you're dealing with.  You can also then look at min, max, median, and mean, where median trims off your lag tail.
[06:03:34] <smallville7123> and thus the current fps will drift more and more from what it otherwise should be as things take longer and longer in relation to the elapsed time since the first frame
[06:04:21] <InPhase> smallville7123: "time delta" means the time since the last frame.

[10:13:55] <user51> tragedy of the gnommons
[10:17:13] <smallville7123> how do i smooth out a rapidly updating value? for example, if X goes jumps from 3 to 16 and then jumps from 16 to 11
[10:17:59] <Decker> N=(N*M+O)/(M+1)
[10:18:10] <Decker> where O is each new X
[10:18:21] <Decker> and M is a smoothing constant
[10:19:16] <pikapika> Decker, interesting
[10:19:22] <pikapika> what is the mathematical basis for this?
[10:19:31] <Decker> basicall weighted average
[10:19:59] <pikapika> I love how you had the answer immediately at hand
[10:20:03] <pikapika> What problem were you working on?
[10:20:04] <Decker> (N*M+O+1)/M+1  = N+1  * (M+1)/(M+1)

[14:55:13] <mrig> Hello, does anyone know how I can emulate being on a windows system with wine, when simply running executables rather than running installed programs?
[14:56:02] <mrig> I'm trying to write a file, but I'm not sure if this is going to be able to work or not?
[14:56:33] <pyzozord> mrig: generally you can do 'wine prog.exe' nad if you are lucky it will just work. Make sure you install and setup wine first though
[14:56:37] <user51> there's also this http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html
[14:57:02] <mrig> It is running the program ok, it is just the file paths that I'm having some difficulty with.
[14:57:42] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[14:58:13] <pyzozord> paths will translate from C:\\Program\ Files\ to ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files etc
[14:58:26] <pyzozord> so your program can think it's on windows and use windows paths
[14:58:51] <pyzozord> wine is designed to literally run windows programs on linux
[14:59:35] <GeDaMo> You can have multiple drive Cs
[14:59:56] <GeDaMo> Set an environment variable before running wine, I think it's called WINEPREFIX
[15:00:11] <mrig> yes, i've got a false drive set up as the project folder on windows, I suppose I need to try to emulate this with wine.
[15:00:24] <arahael> mrig: Note -  it's not emulation.
[15:00:26] <mrig> oh that sounds promising, thank you!

[15:00:56] <mrig> It is a lot better than running the .exe in the windows VM, which is pretty cool.
[15:00:58] *** Quits: Nspace (~Nspace@user/nspace) (Quit: Nspace)
[15:01:23] <arahael> mrig: I'm not completely sure of the mechanism it's using, but it's effectively running the application "directly", after setting up the libraries and dll's it needs.
[15:01:35] <arahael> mrig: Think LD_PRELOAD hacks on steriods.
[15:01:59] <mrig> the VM adds some glitches to sound and video which make debugging a little tricky, so I'm using wine to test the .exe.

[17:08:01] <mawk> when I learnt C/C++ it was in fashion to learn first C then C++

[17:15:15] <LiaoTao> While I am a staunch C++ proponent, I sort of have to agree with DnzAtWrk that C++ can and should be simple. People tend to find a comfortable personal subset of it because there are so many pitfalls and caveats to learn.
[17:15:15] <pulse> how many years before you grok 10% of topology?
[17:15:28] <Inst> by the way, how good is functional programming paradigms in C++?
[17:15:31] <LiaoTao> In no other language have I met engineers with 20 years of experience who don't use core features
[17:15:36] <Inst> like, functions aren't first-class objects
[17:15:36] <pulse> LiaoTao, yes, the way to use C++ effectively is to pick a workable subset and rarely venture out of it

[17:15:55] <mawk> like int (&)[2]; if you don't know C and its syntax you wouldn't know what that is pulse , and that is semi-common C++ stuff
[17:16:03] <merijn> So...any of you have experience debugging CMake files? I'm trying to figure out which CMake target is responsible for including specific libraries into the final link step
[17:16:20] <mawk> people wouldn't know what the hell this (&) thing means; but when you know that it's the C definition syntax of the form "type f(name)" then it lights up
[17:16:33] <Inst> this is just for hobby purposes, not looknig for a career in it, although becoming a Haskell dev
[17:16:39] <LiaoTao> merijn, I have tons of experience, but I don't have an answer apart from order your dependencies correctly

[17:16:41] <Inst> might be fun as an alternative to flipping burgers

[17:17:21] <merijn> LiaoTao: The problem is that it's using target_link_libraries with reference to *cmake* targets, not specific libraries
[17:17:29] <LiaoTao> I know, that's what I'm talking about
[17:17:32] <Inst> C++ is, like, omnibus programming language, right?
[17:17:35] <pulse> is Rust less complex than C++ btw?
[17:17:39] <merijn> LiaoTao: So each of those targets expands into multiple actual libraries and I can't figure out which come from which
[17:17:42] <pulse> or is it a similar vortex of madness
[17:18:07] <Inst> it should have everything but good functional if my research is correct, and that still has to be clarified if C++20 has decent functional support
[17:18:09] <LiaoTao> merijn, Yes. I've debugged targets like that 6 levels deep or so. If you are deeper than that then may God have mercy on your soul

[17:19:17] <merijn> So I need to track down the offender that's linking the wrong MKL library
[17:19:19] <LiaoTao> pulse, Rust is deceptively simple and can be almost as deep as C++
[17:19:37] <pulse> i mean, can you learn all of Rust or a significant portion of it
[17:19:42] <merijn> pulse: Rust is *differently* complex and, imo, more managable
[17:20:15] <LiaoTao> Rust has less caveats to learn, so it's definitely more manageable from a learning perspective
[17:20:22] <merijn> C++ has a lot of incidental complexity for historical reasons, which means a lot of the complexity is just lack of coherent design and rote memorisation of gotchas
[17:20:41] <pulse> there's not that many gotchas in modern C++ i find
[17:20:42] <merijn> Rust is complex in the sense that there's a bunch of extra rules. But at least those rules are fairly consistent and well-defined
[17:20:50] <pulse> in C++98 there were considerably more
[17:21:10] <pulse> well, depends on abstraction i suppose
[17:21:10] <audiocat> merijn, so i'm talking with a friend of mine who built a crypto exchange and works as a dev for a pretty popular crrypto exchange
[17:21:15] <merijn> pulse: Sure, if all your code is modern C++11 or later, written by competent people
[17:21:22] <audiocat> merijn, he said an exchange isn't really needed for my purposes for the app
[17:21:22] <merijn> pulse: Which, of course, 99% isn't :p
[17:21:26] <pulse> yeah, even so you can get into some mad territory
[17:21:31] <LiaoTao> pulse, UB lurks beneath every rock if you are working with people without the caveat experience :)
[17:21:35] <audiocat> but if it were, it's a pretty full-time job for 2-4 people
[17:21:52] <pulse> LiaoTao, compilers have gotten pretty good at warning about all sorts of shenanigans these days
[17:22:01] <merijn> pulse: I know, I have 10 line templates prefixes on some stuff >.>
[17:22:15] <pulse> i think the worst part of C++ is iterators
[17:22:23] <leduyquang753> I love the utter freedom one has in C++.
[17:22:24] <pulse> if you ever try to implement custom iterators for a semi-complex data structure, you'll go mad
[17:22:28] <pulse> at least i did

[17:23:10] <LiaoTao> I think the worst part is actually templates and how they pollute the scope. At the same time template metaprogramming is the best part.
[17:23:13] <mawk> pulse: the worst part is SFINAE and all the template tricks
[17:23:30] <merijn> mawk: Man...those fucking constructor rules
[17:23:34] <merijn> I can never remember them

[23:20:41] <quetzl> if you store it on disk you know you gotta encrypt it
[23:20:46] <oldlaptop> dimino: I'd call https://www.sqlite.org/affcase1.html a good practical example. (Something's "managing it for you", obviously, though it's not the OS)

[23:21:17] <quetzl> idk how it works with passwords
[23:22:24] <oldlaptop> the scheme described there doesn't necessitate working directly from disk, but it could be done and in practice would often make sense (in the hypothetical DRHOffice I would bet it'd be a knob, push this button to have the file loaded into a :memory: database and this one to open it directly)

[23:23:40] <oldlaptop> quetzl: I still don't understand your point. When would you "store a password in RAM" under circumstances where it would make sense to "encrypt it"?
[23:24:13] <quetzl> idk i suppose whatever can be done to disk can be done to ram
[23:26:24] <quetzl> but maybe you wanna super encrypt it. like 500 chars per char, then u can use disk, and it's safer? im making stuff up now
