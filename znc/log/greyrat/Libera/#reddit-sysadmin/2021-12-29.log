[20:13:33] <sd> 13<C​olour> Home setups can become much better than office setups with even a small amount of effort.
[20:38:23] <Alternity> isnt lg going to add a 41 inch oled?
[20:38:42] <Alternity> an ultrawide oled monitor would be amazing

[23:00:05] <radix0> CableNinja, you like horror movies right?
[23:00:23] <CableNinja> depends. mostly I find them ridiculously stupid, but it really depends
[23:00:45] <radix0> I thought so. I found this on reddit the other day while clicking random out of boredom, might be up your alley. https://old.reddit.com/r/IcebergCharts/comments/lavwrj/horror_cinema/
[23:01:17] <DrZak> The only reason why the Pyramids exist in Egypt is because they were to heavy for the British to steal.
[23:02:34] <CableNinja> lol well I guess I dont like horror movies as much as i thought because theres basically fuckall I'd watch or would want to watch on that lol
[23:03:27] <sd> 09<H​aise> radix0: I regret googling some of this shit
[23:03:29] <CableNinja> also like half the lower half of that shit just sounds like snuff

[23:03:53] <radix0> I really didn't read it, I just saw it and remembered a convo from wayyyy back in my logs
[23:04:01] <radix0> I'm not "into" horror myself
[23:04:27] <sd> 09<H​aise> I like horror, more on supernatural and exorcism side than slasher
[23:04:32] <sd> 09<H​aise> but this shit takes it to whole new level
[23:05:08] <CptLuxx> lol guinea pih
[23:05:12] <CableNinja> right thats why I was like 'oh I guess I dont like horror as much as I thought' because apparently I dont know what horror is

[23:34:59] <vinrock> lawl
[23:39:10] <int0x1C8> question, do you guys who have on-prem exchange use an ReFS volume for where the database is kept?
[23:39:16] <int0x1C8> or just NTFS
[23:40:05] <signofzeta> I didn't think Exchange supported ReFS, but it's been a long time since I've set up a server.
[23:42:00] <int0x1C8> apparently since 2013
[23:42:14] <CableNinja> vinrock, I read that, thought it was hilarious. alexa just makin sure the strongest and smartest survive
[23:42:44] <int0x1C8> this guide I'm following to migrate 2010 to 2016 recommends ReFS
[23:43:00] <int0x1C8> eh fuck that 
[23:43:00] <fritzwastaken> I just installed Windows10 on a D630. It has a Centrino
[23:43:32] <fritzwastaken> it felt so weird to actually feel a spinning drive in a laptop
[23:43:47] <cryptic1> but... but.... why
[23:44:16] <fritzwastaken> Because it has a serial port and im going to set it up as a remote switch configuration station
[23:44:30] <NewYearsGibby> USB->Serial man
[23:44:36] <fritzwastaken> Just didnt feel like working with windows xp
[23:44:40] <fritzwastaken> my usb to serial is in use

[23:44:46] <NewYearsGibby> WELL NEVERMIND
[23:46:38] <fritzwastaken> lol cryptic1 dont hate on the D630, those things were hard core

[23:52:43] <PublicWiFi> exchange server isn't licensed per core is it?
[23:52:45] *** Joins: mikespears (sid124497@id-124497.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[23:52:47] <PublicWiFi> like normal server?
[23:54:37] <signofzeta> Exchange Server is not, but Windows Server still is.

[23:57:50] <PublicWiFi> ty
[23:58:02] <PublicWiFi> so migrating this box to a new host won't violate some BS
[23:59:53] <signofzeta> As long as your new host has the correct number of Windows Server licenses (if using OEM/System Builder/Retail stickers).
