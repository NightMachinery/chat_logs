[01:44:40] <jan6> ah yes, classic evil politicians https://reclaimthenet.org/police-were-called-on-developers-of-privacy-focused-open-source-schoolwork-app/
[01:44:42] <SeaDough> ^ Sweden: Police were called on developers who created privacy-focused open-source schoolwork app
[01:53:26] <Joanna> jan6: sounds like Sweden has some corrupt people buying software
[01:59:00] <jan6> to sum up, basically official app cost $117M to develop, was rated 1.2 stars, and its 18 different modules were entrusted to 3 companies, one of the frustrated parents made their own, and a few months later the city authorities reported for a potential data breach, which didn't stop it from becoming more and more populat both among developers and parents, and in the end, they didn't find any data
[01:59:00] <jan6> leaks, and eventually the city even came round to allow that app, and others, to access their data
[01:59:34] <jan6> but classic politician move, "we spent money on this, they're threatening to do a better job, we must shut them down!"
[02:01:30] <Joanna> I wonder what politicians relationship was to the companies. Sounds like a political favor . Most of the money was probably not spent on the actual program.
[02:04:27] <jan6> also, three companies for one app
[02:23:22] <Joanna> I wonder if all their software is bad
[02:25:05] <jan6> probably
[02:25:24] <jan6> but if you paid for it, you're gonna keep using it, if it works, probably

[11:41:45] <spaceone> hi, i need some help on a AES-256-CBC attack. The ciphertext is not checked against a hmac. I know the complete plaintext. I have blocks of 16bytes/128bits. There is a random IV. What I want to achive is to change the ciphertext, so that decrypting it returns my modified version of the first 2 blocks. For the first block this is simple: responseIV = responseIV XOR Plaintext XOR My-Text.
[11:42:07] <spaceone> But I don't understand what I have to do next. What I thought is: Ciphertext-Block1 XOR Plaintext Block 2 XOR My-Text.
[11:42:15] <spaceone> but then the second and third block is messed up.
[11:42:35] <spaceone> So maybe I have to reverse the whole thing and start with the last block?
