[00:09:07] <gordonfish> LeoNerd: How exactly is ADJUSTPARAMS($params) supposed to work? The docs say "receives in addition a reference to the hash containing the current constructor parameters" but $params is always empty for me:
[00:09:14] <gordonfish> sweval: use Data::Dumper; $Data::Dumper::Terse=$Data::Dumper::Useqq=1; use Object::Pad; class Foo { has $x :param = 2; has $y :param = undef; ADJUSTPARAMS($params) { say "AP [x:$x] params:". ::Dumper $params; } method out { print qq{out [x:$x] [y:$y]}; } } Foo->new(x => 3);
[00:09:16] <perlbot> gordonfish: AP [x:3] params:{}   🦃
[00:09:34] <gordonfish> Instead I see $x is already set.

[00:19:22] <bmeneg> btw, I'm using `cpanm` for installing it

[00:58:47] <gordonfish> (Though those test programs are very simple, barely more complicated than hello-world.c so this is indeed really bizzare.)
[00:59:00] <bmeneg> gordonfish, the assembler output there.. "Error: unknown pseudo-op: `.attach_to_group'" I remember seeing them one day (couple releases ago?) but I have no idea if they're false positives or what

[11:50:16] <merpaderp> is it okay to call Getopts::Long getopts twice in some particular piece of mad codes?
[11:50:25] <merpaderp> like, main script does that for one set of params - ignores the others
[11:50:49] <merpaderp> and then some module, call it Merp::DB which also calls Getopts and parses only opts meant for it?
[11:51:29] <merpaderp> I think Getopts::Long doesnt destroy @ARGV after parsing, so perfectly fine? as far as they ignore parameters not defined ( dont die on weird parameters )

[23:38:09] <Grinnz> Mojo::Pg is already a connection manager and provides transaction helpers.
[23:38:42] <Grinnz> otherwise, you have to reinvent the logic of ensuring that either a commit or rollback occurs when the scope ends, normally or abnormally

[23:39:58] <phryk> Oh, oooh. I was only reading the docs of DBD::Pg for this. Wasn't aware Mojo::Pg added so much. Thanks, Grinnz. :)
[23:42:17] <Grinnz> when not using Mojo::Pg, DBIx::Connector or DBIx::Handler provide just the connection management and transaction helpers
[23:44:15] <phryk> That makes it way more understandable what Mojo::Pg is actually for. :)

[23:48:20] <Grinnz> quite frankly, DBI itself is too low an abstraction level for users, outside of the specific case of a script that connections, runs a couple queries, and exits
[23:48:54] <Grinnz> connects*
[23:50:05] <phryk> Aye, connection management seems like the lower bar for acceptable DX.
[23:50:36] <Grinnz> hell, if DBI even had an interface like Mojo::Pg's ->query would be a vast improvement
[23:50:58] <Grinnz> newbies never understand selectrow/fetchrow/do/etc
[23:51:53] <phryk> I assume ->query is the generic mechanism underlying things like ->select and ->insert?
[23:53:18] <Grinnz> yes, and it's basically just ->do that returns a results object to decide how to retrieve results after, instead of an arcane attributes parameter in the middle of the args
[23:53:51] <Grinnz> also with the ability to define bind types
[23:54:01] <Grinnz> which is insanely annoying to do in raw DBI
[23:55:02] <phryk> I don't even know what bind types are. ^^
[23:55:12] <Grinnz> parameter binding
[23:55:20] <phryk> Also, does $result->hash() imply ->commit?
[23:55:28] <Grinnz> no
[23:55:50] <Grinnz> in mojo's scope guard you have to ->commit explicitly before it goes out of scope
[23:55:52] <phryk> Parameterized queries with "?" are not a thing in raw DBI?
[23:55:58] <Grinnz> they are
[23:56:10] <Grinnz> it's just annoying if you want to specify a type of a paramter, specifically
[23:56:14] <gordonfish> Grinnz: { Re: Object::Pad } I've found that setting reader in a base class and overriding the reader method in a superclass works well:
[23:56:18] <gordonfish> sweval: use Object::Pad; class B1 { has $z :reader = 5; has $y :reader; ADJUST { $y = $self->z; } } class D1 isa B1 { method z { 7 } } class D2 isa B1 { } [ map $_->y, D1->new, D2->new ];
[23:56:19] <Grinnz> which is something you need to do in order to insert non-textual data
[23:56:20] <perlbot> gordonfish: [7,5]
[23:56:36] <phryk> Grinnz: Oh, ew.^^
[23:57:25] <Grinnz> in Mojo::Pg you can do $db->query('INSERT INTO bar VALUES (?)', {type => PG_BYTEA, value => $bytes}); ( from the query examples)
[23:57:48] <gordonfish> (Although it doesn't actually change the slot itself.)
[23:57:52] <gordonfish> sweval: use Object::Pad; class B1 { has $z :reader = 5; has $y :reader; method slot_z { $z } ADJUST { $y = $self->z; } } class D1 isa B1 { method z { 7 } } class D2 isa B1 { } [ map [$_->y, $_->slot_z], D1->new, D2->new ];
[23:57:54] <perlbot> gordonfish: [[7,5],[5,5]]
[23:58:00] <Grinnz> in DBI that looks like my $sth = $dbh->prepare('INSERT INTO bar VALUES (?)'); $sth->bind_param(1, $bytes, PG_BYTEA); $sth->execute;
[23:58:11] <Grinnz> which gets real annoying when you have several params
[23:59:08] <phryk> Ah yes, that's the sort of thing I'd end up writing a more sugar-y abstraction for^^

[23:59:28] <Grinnz> yeah, at work i'm using DBIx::Connector so I wrote a wrapper
[23:59:52] <Grinnz> which looks vaguely like ->query from Mojo::Pg, but i can also pass it 'blob'
