[01:55:49] <GuiToris> ok, here's an other one that I found : 'Police broke into the house'
[01:56:01] <GuiToris> why is this just police, instead of the police?
[01:56:50] <mdogg> De Do Do do..
[01:56:52] <mdogg> =p
[01:57:28] <mdogg> Don't stand so close to me.
[01:58:18] <GuiToris> if I hadn't looked it up, I wouldn't know what you are talking about
[01:58:32] <mdogg> I'm just messing around.
[01:59:05] <twb> GuiToris: in a headline?
[01:59:39] <GuiToris> no, I think this should be a complete sentence. Something that I could say to my friend
[02:00:55] <mdogg> You can say that to a friend.  "I was looking across the street and police broke into the house across from me."
[02:01:51] <GuiToris> I find this so empty, well all the sentences feel empty that don't have an article :O
[02:01:55] <GuiToris> ok, thank you
[02:03:10] <mdogg> The term "police" in that context is generic.  That could mean the Sheriff department, or any government agency possessing police powers.  If you say "the police" it means (in America) the city police which is governed by a chief of police within a certain city.
[02:04:23] <GuiToris> I don't get this generic thing, I was just about to say it's not generic at all. A small group entered the house, not any or all the policemen
[02:05:09] <GuiToris> Similarly; Construction on the highway is holding up traffic again  <- feels incomplete
[02:05:18] <mdogg> "..sheriff deputies broke into the house" or "..the police broke into the house" or "the FBI broke into the house" they are all "police".
[02:07:11] <GuiToris> I accept your reasoning, I cannot say I fully understood it and I will never make such a mistake in the future, but I'll memorize this and try to use it this way
[02:07:34] <mdogg> In your example of construction - a general statement could be "..construction on the highway is holding up traffic.."  But if you use "THE", then you have to qualify it with "The construction on Highway 6 is holding up traffic" - or at least indicate which construction if you use 'the'.
[02:09:31] <GuiToris> I thought it was quite definite already, assuming that a road doesn't have multiple ongoing constructions
[02:10:03] <GuiToris> I just hope it will make sense eventually
[02:10:16] <GuiToris> I've been struggling with this for decades
[02:11:59] <GuiToris> mdogg, you didn't chime in my first sentence, do you prefer it with or without the: (The) high fees will put many students off applying to university

[02:40:11] <FLHerne> GuiToris: mdogg's police distinction is quite US-centric and makes little sense to me in Britain
[02:40:52] <FLHerne> Here you could use either 'The police broke in..." or "Police broke in..." pretty much interchangeably
[02:41:37] *** Joins: Hazza (~Haxxa@89nnjg0xckz9ggn6r5xm.ip6.superloop.com)
[02:42:11] <FLHerne> "The police" would be referring to the police service as an organisation, and "Police" as shorthand for police officers, but the distinction doesn't matter in that context
[02:43:00] <GuiToris> ahh, okay, at first I thought you were talking about the british band
[02:44:10] <GuiToris> I would put 'the' before every noun, sadly this isn't just how English works :(
[02:44:39] <GuiToris> I'm so used to using articles that it's difficult not to use them
[02:44:53] <FLHerne> GuiToris: In "Construction on the highway...", the word "Construction" is in its sense as a noun for 'the process of constructing something', not 'a specific object that has been/is being constructed'
[02:45:32] <FLHerne> you could also have "Rioting on the highway", say
[02:45:39] <GuiToris> I meant the location was specific
[02:46:27] <GuiToris> The accident took place on road whatever, the accident, specific accident, not any accidents
[02:46:33] <GuiToris> the construction = the accident
[02:46:37] <GuiToris> this is how I image things
[02:47:03] <mdogg> FLHerne: makes sense.  
[02:47:27] <FLHerne> You'd use "the" if you were describing a particular construction site
[02:47:57] <mdogg> Or a specific organization.  Of course it depends on where you reside.  
[02:48:04] <GuiToris> I'll try to memorize these sentences as they are, and hopefully they will make sense in the future
[02:48:10] <mdogg> Good call FLHerne.
[02:48:21] <mdogg> I wasn't able to put that into words I guess.. heh
[02:48:29] <FLHerne> "the road construction at Junction 12 is blocking traffic again"
[02:49:26] <FLHerne> but often the person you're talking to doesn't care about where exactly the obstacle that made you late is
[02:49:30] <mdogg> or..  "road construction generally impedes traffic..."
[02:49:46] <FLHerne> or, yes, it could be truly generic
[02:49:56] <GuiToris> thank you :)
[02:50:07] <FLHerne> there might be multiple worksites impeding traffic, or worksites as an abstract concept
[02:50:08] <LjL> English is a bit of an "intermediate language" in how often it likes to use articles
[02:50:20] <LjL> less than Romance, more than... languages without articles
[02:51:13] <FLHerne> Anyway, since I'm British I'd always use "roadworks" for road works, and never "highway" because we don't have those :p
[02:51:23] <LjL> you have highways
[02:51:27] <LjL> they're just not the same as highways!
[02:51:27] <FLHerne> we have "the public highway" as a concept
[02:51:40] <mdogg> The motorway. 
[02:51:48] <LjL> the vroomvroomway
[02:51:49] <mdogg> Sorry, The Motorway.
[02:52:08] <LjL> my way or the motorway.
[02:52:20] <FLHerne> and I suppose Highways England would argue in favour of highways plural being a thing...
[02:52:37] <FLHerne> but I'm not sure what that's supposed to be defined as exactly :p
[02:52:54] <FLHerne> (they maintain motorways and some major A-roads)
[02:53:37] <LjL> well that's funny
[02:53:46] <FLHerne> Oh, that's another random en_GB vs en_US quirk :D
[02:53:49] <LjL> you don't call them highways, except for the organization that manages them, which does!
[02:53:59] <LjL> how confusingly british

[02:55:37] <twb> in Australia that would be more like "oh you get on Burwood and head west until you hit the Eastlink and then go south until you reach Blackwood Road"
[02:56:03] <mdogg> "organizations are plural"?
[02:56:14] <LjL> mdogg, you can say "Google are planning..."
[02:56:27] <FLHerne> ^
[02:56:28] <twb> Of course often the same major road will change name, with no indication, because in 1890 they were two separate roads and now they're joined together
[02:56:33] <twb> So that can be kinda annoying
[02:56:42] <twb> but I think still easier to remember than just numbers
[02:56:56] <FLHerne> mdogg: In US English, organisations and companies are usually grammatically singular
[02:57:06] <twb> And both are better than "turn left where the pub used to be"

[02:58:41] <FLHerne> whereas here traditionally it's "FooCorp are... have..."
[02:58:47] <LjL> FLHerne, i don't really know how it is in British vs American as i tend to use the plural even though most of my spelling (and maybe other things) are american... but for my idiolect, whatever that is, singular and plural are both acceptable, just if i use the singular i mean more the company as an entity, while if i use the plural i mean the people behind it
[02:59:17] <LjL> (then again, i almost regularly say "police is" and then go "duh" despite learning about police being plural like in middle school)
[02:59:39] <FLHerne> I know it's blurred a bit recently, I see singular used in British English news articles sometimes

[03:09:57] <mdogg> If a lane is created because there is a need for it that's one thing.  But if it is created in the hopes that it will create utilization, that's something else.
[03:10:24] <LjL> actually i believe there are studies that show if you reduce lanes, and just make them pedestrian sidewalks or plant trees or something (so presumably also if you make them bus-only, i guess?), eventually you get less traffic, while just adding more lanes ends up adding more traffic and then you have to add more lanes etc

[07:19:53] <Jong> What's the opposite of manager? "underling" comes to mind, but that word sounds weird.
[07:20:03] <twb> peon
[07:20:09] <twb> "essential worker"
[07:21:12] <^-^hi> employee
[07:22:05] <twb> You're talking about the "leaf nodes" in an org chart, yeah?

[07:22:09] <Jong> well, the manager is also an employee and essential worker
[07:23:19] <twb> Jong: yeah "essential worker" was a semi-joke.  Managers don't "do" things, so they're not essential
[07:23:51] <^-^hi> well, when you contrast it to managers in a context it could be understood that way.
[07:24:17] <twb> like if a railway line needs an emergency weld, the guy holding the thermite is essential, but the guy organizing christmas dinner is not

[09:06:50] <mornfall> Dunno about dual, but Russian uses a different form for 2-4 items. So do many other Slavic languages. (Slovak: one pot, jeden hrniec; two pots, dva hrnce; four pots, ≈°tyri hrnce; five pots, p√§≈• hrncov‚Ä¶)

[11:25:45] <LordRishav> huf: It also can cause a confusion with the free meaning 'gratis'
[11:26:08] <huf> LordRishav: yes, that's why people came up with "libre"
[11:26:22] <LordRishav> But libre isn't an English word
[11:26:27] <huf> it is now
[11:29:39] <furrykef> Jong: well, any number can go in there. I'm not sure how old my inner voice is, myself.
[11:30:05] <Jong> My inner voice sounds like a 10 year old kid. I'm trying to change that.
[11:30:59] <Jong> I theory is that if I change my inner voice, it'll make my real voice more natural instead of artificially high pitch that I've developed out of habit.
[11:31:20] <Jong> btw, is "theory" the word you would have used?
[11:31:47] <Jong> maybe "hypothesis" is more accurate?
[11:32:28] <furrykef> "Hypothesis" is more accurate, but "theory" is more common in a non-scientific context
