[03:11:32] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> well I can only say that many layers have well-written sections... but in overall it's hard to maintain because everything is contributed by various people over the years... (almost 10 years)

[03:21:15] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> we've released 0.200 many years ago and haven't released 0.300, even though all the milestones have been completed
[03:23:42] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> The author Sylvain wants to incorporate Spacelpa in 0.300 but that part has not got any progress for a few years...
[03:25:43] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I wanted to introduce a fixed release cycle of 6 weeks. There would be no breaking change and only bug fix between 2 releases.  But some people don't understand this idea and prefer our current de facto rolling release model.
[03:26:20] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but this makes it hard to actually bring in breaking changes.
[03:28:49] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> for example, I really want people to configure there packages via org-mode's literal programming.
[03:30:00] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> This softly forces users to read documentations and document their own configurations.
[03:30:36] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> It's intuitive and indirectly encourages better documentation in layer README.
[03:31:28] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> But this change is breaking. I don't want people found that their .spacemacs doesn't work any more after a git pull
[04:01:36] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> What about forking for that feature‚Äìset / breaking change, and establishing an alternative release cycle from the current rolling Spacemacs development cycle? I'm sure you've considered it already, and its many pitfalls (users, mostly).
[04:02:53] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> A literate programming approach for user configuration of Spacemacs would be very nice.
[04:03:58] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Different from simply tangling to `.spacemacs`, what is your idea of how that would work?
[04:04:41] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Opinionated is a feature of Spacemacs already, given the few (documented) conventions and package infrastructure.
[04:05:37] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> SPACElpa would be nice for a 6-week release cycle, and would bring back the `[Update Spacemacs]` in the `spacemacs-buffer.el`, eh?

[05:07:52] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> @luyangliuable, without looking at the documentation for the mode-function, I'd say put `(scroll-bar-mode t)` in your user-init
[05:08:30] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Indeed.
[05:08:41] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> > ideally keys should be surrounded in <kbd></kbd> tags. This is supported by modern browsers. But I haven't tried whether it would be rendered correctly.
[05:08:58] <FromGitter> <luyangliuable> I tried it it wasn't working for some reason. It only works when I directly run scroll-bar-mode every time
[05:09:07] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Org has a shortcut for inserting the kbd tags, but Spacedoc doesn't have any enrichment for it.

[05:10:34] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> The present convention of using tildes `~` is okay, and human‚Äìreadable unlike raw HMTL which will read badly in Org mode. When you export to HTML, kbd is of course rendered. Not inside Org or spacedoc buffers, though.
[05:11:14] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> @luyangliuable check the documentation for the modes with `SPC h d a`
[05:12:12] <FromGitter> <luyangliuable> Thanks
[05:12:50] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> You can also put it in user-config, in case a package that you have enabled is disabling the scroll-bar. I'm not familiar with the functions and packages that Spacemacs configures for its default UI, so it might be necessary to put it in user-config rather than user-init too.
[05:14:38] <FromGitter> <luyangliuable>  (https://files.gitter.im/543c742ddb8155e6700cb292/YI2G/image.png)

[05:17:02] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> That's part of the default Spacemacs "spaceline". It's the modeline UI default. That element of the modeline is the percentage, vertically, of *point*'s position in the current buffer. The yellow line is a representation of that as well.
[05:18:05] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Consult the documentation for the modeline in Spacemacs. `SPC f e d` then `SPC s s [spaceline]` and run apropos on as much as you can, digging through code and such with the other help functions.
[05:19:14] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Don't type the brackets, they're only meant to indicate what to type in the minibuffer.
[05:20:10] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> try M-x customize-group spaceline
[05:20:31] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's a bad idea to enable scroll bar ...
[05:21:15] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> scrolling itself is not working well
