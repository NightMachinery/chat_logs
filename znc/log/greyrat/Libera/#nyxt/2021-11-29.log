[02:52:19] <edgarvincent[m]> I asked Fermin about his views on Nyxt in the Q&A, but unfortunately, I joined the room too late to hear his answer. The recordings of the Q&A sessions will be made available in the next month or so.

[14:11:37] <Kabouik> Admittedly I have more buffers open
[14:22:37] <Kabouik> It also showed me that it's very hard to understand what's going on in emacs when you never used emacs. :>

[16:58:22] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: Wow, thanks for sharing the Orgdown post, it has given me more motivation to tinker with Org parsers :D

[16:59:07] <aartaka> xD
[17:01:43] <edgarvincent[m]> I think Orgdown is an excellent initiative. Having a clear specification as well as different levels of integrations will prove to be very beneficial I'm sure.

[20:05:13] * aartaka tries to understand how parser combinators work in one of CL Org parsing libraries.
[20:06:14] <lagash> Are there any plans to port Nyxt to Plan9? No pun intended! :D
[20:06:38] <waleee> sounds haskelly (to use parser combinators)
[20:07:25] <waleee> lagash: does webkit compile on plan9?
[20:11:57] <lagash> waleee: no idea, good question.. they don't really have a decent browser yet.. besides netsurf I guess
[20:13:48] <lagash> Netsurf of course uses its own rendering engine

[20:30:04] <aartaka> waleee: The Haskelly sound of parser combinators is a correct intuition: the person that written the most featureful Org parsing library in CL is a Haskeller :D
[20:50:26] <mariari> parser combinators are great!
[20:50:29] <mariari> really makes parsing easy
[20:51:11] <mariari> when I worked in clojure I just used one off the shelf, so that was nice
