[00:50:12] <persephone> hello I'm using oh-my-zsh and had a question about tab completion on filepaths
[00:51:09] <persephone> when writting out long commands the tab completion doesn't work on the second like after pressing \ then shift enter
[00:51:43] <persephone> what would I have to alter to make zsh use tab completion for each successive line?
[00:51:54] <phy1729> !omz
[00:51:54] <machabot> "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the discord https://discord.gg/ohmyzsh or https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/discussions
[00:55:26] <persephone> okay thx
[00:55:42] <persephone> what's the quickest way to disable omz?

[07:55:43] <llua> not sure which way would be preferred from zsh's pov that or setting words[1]=python-$words[1] then calling normal. in the latter case one can have a compdef line like you suggested

[07:56:10] <llua> would be a question for the mailing list, preferrably opk's opinion

[22:03:06] <hexchain> I'm trying to call a command with an argument list generated from a list of files, specifically like this: command -a file1 -a file2 -a file3 ... (basically file* in a directory)
[22:03:30] <hexchain> Without manually specifying each file name, is there a one-liner for such job?
[22:04:31] <bremner> xargs?
[22:04:38] <bremner> or find
[22:04:39] <phy1729> Can the args be attached?
[22:06:07] <hexchain> attached?
[22:06:07] <phy1729> (If yes, I'd    foo=(file*); command -a$^foo    )

[22:08:29] <hexchain> Yes, they can be attached in this case. Is it still possible if they cannot?
[22:11:13] <hexchain> I stumbled upon the 'e' qualifier but couldn't really understand the output, but that's another question I guess...

[22:26:17] <hexchain> Another question is about the 'e' qualifier. Suppose there are 3 files: aa, bb and cc in a directory, then `echo *(e:'reply=(${REPLY}{1,2})':)' prints "aa1 aa2 bb1 bb2 cc1 cc2", but `echo *(e:'reply=(-a ${REPLY})':)' prints "-a -a -a aa bb cc".

[22:27:17] <phy1729> iirc glob sorting happens after e evaluation
[22:27:45] <phy1729> would probably work with oN as well
[22:27:53] <hexchain> Oh... that explains
[22:28:37] <hexchain> so the '$reply's are not just concatenated, they are further sorted
[22:29:59] <hexchain> And 'oN' does help. Thanks again!

[22:31:59] <panke> I am playing around with auto completions for zsh and for files I am using '_path_files -f'. Is there a completion mode in zsh that would trigger normal file completion but lets me also add some kind of help text as well?
[22:32:43] <phy1729> Why are you using _path_files and not _files?
[22:32:54] <panke> Cause I copied from pythons click.
[22:33:10] <llua> cargo culting
[22:33:32] <phy1729> Also usually it'll be used in conjunction with _arguments or _describe or something
[22:33:41] <panke> it's not cargo culting as long as planes are still dropping boxes.
[22:33:58] <llua> boxes of trash
[22:35:22] <panke> I have got more or less the same as here: https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/main/src/click/shell_completion.py and it does the job. Having some description for position parameters that complete to files would be the iceing on the cake.
[22:36:40] <phy1729> It's not using _arguments and I don't think I want to know what it is doing
[22:37:03] <panke> Is it that bad?
[22:37:07] <llua> yes
[22:37:29] <panke> I like the idea that it asks the program itself for completions options. 
[22:37:52] <phy1729> It's doing the crummy just complete the next word after this isn't it?
[22:38:15] <llua> that doing so foregoes the power of the shell's completion system
[22:39:31] <panke> Honestly, I don't know what you mean llua. Could you elaborate a bit what's not possible with that approach?
[22:39:33] *** Quits: Hello71 (~Hello71@wireguard/contributor/hello71) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:40:03] <panke> I am not very well versed in zsh's completion system. I read some blogpost and the man page, but only once.
[22:42:46] <llua> a lot of how a user can customize shell completion is made incredibly annoying if not undoable with a completer like you have just shown.
[22:43:33] <panke> Because it is not using _arguments? 
[22:44:15] <llua> for shells with lesser than completion systems the approach may be fine, but with zsh. stuff like ignoring options you don't want to see, adding additional stuff etc becomes harder to do with how simple the function is
[22:44:49] *** Joins: Hello71 (~Hello71@wireguard/contributor/hello71)
[22:45:22] <phy1729> More because there just a list of things to complete next with what's currently on the line. zsh has descriptions and tags and intra-word completion
[22:46:10] <phy1729> I may tell zsh to ignore case when completing some things, but the python code that doing zsh's job has no idea about that config
[22:47:26] *** Joins: greenly (~el@bl8-67-202.dsl.telepac.pt)
[22:47:44] <panke> Isn't the function just providing some options giving the current args and position and choosing between them could still be done like both of you say?
[22:48:04] <panke> I mean the code that filters some options needs to get the options from somewhere as well.
[22:48:40] <llua> indeed, but all of those options are in a single namespace in that function

[22:49:09] <phy1729> What would work better is for the command to have way to generate a completion function and save that off in fpath when installed
[22:49:32] <panke> So the general approach (-> asking the program) is valid but the execution in click is awful?
[22:50:07] <llua> the execution is indeed awful
[22:50:13] <phy1729> You don't ask the program at completion time though
[22:50:21] <panke> The code does.
[22:50:28] <phy1729> It oughtn't
[22:51:17] <panke> Ah ok. Why not? I found it nice that I do not have to reimplement my argument parsing twice, once in my program and once for zsh.
[22:52:24] <phy1729> zsh does the arg parsing part; you can have the completion function generated from the code, but do it once when the program is installed
[22:54:57] <panke> if I take kubectl for an example and want to complete 'kubectl delete pod <TAB>', I do have to teach zsh that at this point only pod names make sense and what these are.
[22:55:37] <phy1729> Sure, but you'd have to do that one way or another
[22:55:50] <panke> I already have that in the program logic.
[22:56:48] <panke> Teaching zsh would be doing it twice (besides maybe I am reluctant because I don't know how). Ins't there some middle ground?

[22:58:04] <phy1729> In that case, usually zsh has to call back into the command to get the list of pods, zsh completers don't typically implement whatever protocol is required to talk to the server
[22:59:47] <panke> Exactly. That's why I think there should be some middle ground, where you basically call back into the program for almost everything but still be a good citizen of the zsh ecosystem.
[23:00:04] <phy1729> For say sysctl, _sysctl gets a list of all variable names by calling the sysctl command not doing the syscall itself, but once it has all of them it can do nicer completion (like sysctl n.i.<tab>
[23:01:02] <phy1729> You just need to call back in to get the instances of a type of thing. For flags and the description and if it takes an arg and of what type should be in the completion function.

[23:02:35] <panke> Isn't it transparent to the completion system where those flags come from?
[23:03:07] <phy1729> I don't understand the question
[23:03:43] <panke> If I write an completion function that generates some baked-in flags for completions 
[23:04:06] <panke> or if I have a completion function that calls back into the program and generates the same flags for completions
[23:04:12] <panke> shouldn't this turn out the same?
[23:04:58] <phy1729> It is preferred to just generate the flags once on installation rather than on every time the user hits tab
[23:05:37] <panke> Ok, but that's has nothing to do with the customizations llua referred to.
[23:06:28] <phy1729> You could generate the completer and eval it each time the user hits tab and get the same features, yes
[23:06:53] <panke> ok
[23:11:20] <panke> Maybe I need to improve my understanding of the completion system a bit more. Any recommened resources besides the man page and official manual?
[23:11:43] <llua> with the completer you shown, doing something like zstyle -e ':completion::complete:jail:argument-rest:jails' fake '[[ -v opt_args[(i)-c] ]] && reply=(/usr/jail/^freebsd*(:t))' to add on to the list of jails would require the user to parsing the entire line themselves
[23:12:09] <llua> since everything would be in something like :completion::complete:foo::
[23:12:46] <llua> if one uses that context, those names are added to any completion attempt, not just when completing jail -c
[23:13:58] <panke> Reading the man page just know, so what you miss in my current approach is a better context spec.

[23:15:14] <llua> that is one of the things, yes
[23:15:31] <panke> What else?

[23:40:49] <llua> the use of _path_files over _files seemingly without reason, the latter better allows the user to customize how files are completed. the direct use of compadd without atleast _wanted. blindly passing $words to the program could be a problem if click isn't able to handle case-insensitive
[23:41:48] *** Joins: zeden (~zeden@user/zeden)
[23:42:38] <llua> the last line using compdef suggests that the program is meant to used like https://yata.mac-anu.org/blog/eval-foo-completion-zsh/
