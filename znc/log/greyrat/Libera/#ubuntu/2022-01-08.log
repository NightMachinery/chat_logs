I cannot map by ID because of this, but with the same name I cannot map by name either. Thank you guys for any suggestions! this is my xinput output https://pasteboard.co/XdG9kMumk87j.apng

[02:13:44] <marc_> how do i check my current cpu speed
[02:15:33] <marc_> its ok i remember cat /proc/cpuinfo
[02:16:36] <marc_> so my next question is, is there a way to limit the cpu speed so it doesnt drop below a certain value
[02:18:57] <sarnold> marc_: that's gotten increasingly complicated over the years .. there's a bunch of documentation in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/ that is perhaps worth a skim
[02:19:33] <sarnold> there's multiple userland tools that also want to own your processor speed; gamemode and thermald are the first two that come to mind, there's probably a dozen more
[02:20:15] <cbreak> why would you want to limit the cpu speed?
[02:20:30] <ogra> and you can directly modify bits and pieces in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy[0-9]*
[02:20:33] <cbreak> frequency scaling is essential for power / thermal management
[02:20:41] *** Joins: paulrf (~paulrf@191.186.155.165)
[02:21:06] <marc_> when im doing disk benchmarks sometimes i get a higher speed sometimes i get a low speed and i noticed my cpu speed is scalling down to 1.2ghz
[02:21:14] <ogra> cbreak, well, if you use the system as game rig you probably want to limit the min_freq values
[02:21:30] <ogra> and keep everything a bit higher up
[02:22:00] <ogra> wasnt there some gaming app that did all that ?
[02:22:36] <marc_> frequency scalling is in play and its a pain

[02:22:43] <ogra> there is is

[10:28:19] <node1> I have connected my `one by wacom` in USB , but it looks nothing appears.
[10:29:28] <tomreyn> try a different usb port

[11:02:04] <ELQEYNN> Then, what is the way to get the icon on the desktop screen?

[11:08:21] <ELQEYNN> darn if I know, you're the one who brought it up.
[11:08:36] <Gallomimia> the problem with the answer to my question is... everything. a concentrated single point of failure. i'm sure they did lots of testing before updating it, and it's not that i don't trust the boyz (and gals?) at canonical, but they're human beings, and we all make mistakes, and there's no way they could have tested every single possible hardware combination
[11:08:51] <Gallomimia> i was wondering if anyone knew anything about the update, if it had any issues

[12:04:16] <Nobrem> I could solve this by changing the seconds,  but then numbers would overlap
[12:04:37] <Nobrem> can I do this with frames instead of seconds?
[12:05:20] <Nobrem> but, doing it with frames would have a downside
[12:05:40] <Nobrem> in my real script, I am doing some math,  and dividing 24 is harder than working with seconds
[12:06:36] <tomreyn> i don't think this is really ubuntu specific enough to have a chance to be solved here.
[12:08:04] <Nobrem> sorry I just wrote the last few lines in the wrong channel

[21:04:55] <leftyfb> regardless, I do not think google chrome on the desktop, at least not for linux supports running as a casting server/destination
