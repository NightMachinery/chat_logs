[02:40:40] <[iz]> lol, what do you think that means when you say that in response to him saying something that isn't an attak?
[02:40:46] <Hash> You can shoot someone's ideas down again and again without attacking them
[02:41:11] <[iz]> are you being intentionally dumb right now to try to make your point valid?

[02:41:21] <Hash> I asked do you dislike me, did I do something to offend? Then he said didn't attack you.I said you don' have to attack someone to 'dislike' them.
[02:41:23] <Hash> :)
[02:41:26] <[iz]> because there's no way you can't understand what is being explained
[02:41:37] <ajak> we don't need to see things like '.cve CVE-2021-1234' then a few seconds later '.cve CVE-2021-1235' and so on
[02:41:52] <Hash> Ok.
[02:41:55] <[iz]> ppl can do that in browser, there's no need to do that crap in channel
[02:42:06] <Hash> Then one can post the link, and the bot will give you a descrition of the CVE
[02:42:10] <Hash> What's the difference?
[02:42:42] <Hash> don't do .CVE something then. Just post the actual link from your browser, and the bot will still read it and everyone a description, so not everyone has to go open a browser.

[02:43:56] <Hash> I didn't say search. I said lookup. Perhaps choice of words was confusing.
[02:44:04] <ajak> you're probably not going to be putting links to CVEs in here to get their description in here though
[02:44:56] <ajak> i don't think anything related to CVEs really needs to be accessible through the bot, there's better sources
[02:45:28] <ajak> also, there's 639 people in here, so everything you do also has an affect on them too
[02:46:09] <Hash> I get it. You don't like me. I don't really care.

[02:46:38] <[iz]> re: signal/noise.. a person pasting a link that is particularly interesting, vs a bot posting the 5 things some web aggregator came up with
[02:46:52] <[iz]> the first will be more signal than noise, the latter reversed
[02:47:17] <mats1> i think Hash would really like discord

[03:32:54] <drewgon> To any fellow aussies
[03:33:14] <Joanna> All I’ve seen so far is people yelling at someone I have on ignore :)
[03:33:40] <Joanna> drewgon: there is an Aussie network I can recommend if you can’t find any here
[03:34:30] <drewgon> Aussie Security network?

[04:04:08] <Joanna> One thing I find really annoying about “modern” social media is how the information is not displayed compactly. It’s designed to eat up your time with scrolling and navigation.

[04:07:24] <Joanna> I hate discord it’s so hard to use and connect to and   The gui was designed by someone who has never heard of a resize event apparently.

[05:56:29] <Joanna> KryptoK: maybe the test is faulty..
[05:56:39] <KryptoK> it is possible
[05:56:49] <Joanna> How long has she been sick?
[05:57:31] <KryptoK> she got alittle achey back Wednesday.
[05:57:45] <KryptoK> it took about 5 days to hit me hard.
[05:57:59] <Joanna> Give it two weeks I guess
[05:58:00] <KryptoK> stayed on me hard for another 5 days.
[05:58:19] <Joanna> It could be a side effect of you know what
[05:58:19] <TimMc> Joanna: You can't know for sure without testing, but loss of sense of taste or smell is a pretty big indicator.
[05:58:22] <drewgon> you the the US KryptoK ?
[05:58:29] <ilikeyou> it's so hard to raise a child properly. Too many ill-equiped take on the challenge

[06:00:47] <drewgon> are you anti Test Joanna?
[06:00:49] <KryptoK> Well, that is how she found out she was negative last time.

[06:03:43] <Joanna> No need for drugs

[06:08:00] <Joanna> I think people are too afraid of getting sick . It’s a perfectly natural thing to happen.
[06:08:25] <KryptoK> I got mrsa I think from a cat scratch a while back.  I got chills that night and they went away the next day.  That was at the start of covid.  I got a covid test and the urgent care doctor swabbed the sore for mrsa.
[06:09:00] <KryptoK> negative for covid but had mrsa.  I felt fine the next day after fever broke.
[06:11:06] <Joanna> I’ve heard those tests can cause health problems
[06:11:11] <KryptoK> I was on a antibiotic for antibiotic resistant diseases
[06:11:33] <KryptoK> mrsa or covid?
[06:12:40] <KryptoK> covid test feels like they are going to ram that swab into your brain.  It will make tears come to your eyes.
[06:13:33] <KryptoK> mrsa test they just took a swab and swabbed the sore to get a sample.
[06:14:22] <KryptoK> So what kind of geeky projects do any of ya have going on lately?
[06:16:32] <Joanna> KryptoK: sometimes the brain fluid starts leaking after the swab is shoved up there
[06:16:58] <KryptoK> I could believe that.  It is not pleasant
[06:21:13] <wilsonfisk> that's rediculous
[06:21:27] <wilsonfisk> you do not lose cerebral spinal fluid from a covid test
[06:22:44] <KryptoK> Well that is comforting that maybe my nose was just running after the test instead of my brain leaking. lol

[06:55:20] <TimMc> Even a little more accurate in some ways. The cadaver I worked with was preserved with formalin, which changes color and texture
[06:55:48] <mats1> how do you teach a baby to draw a perfect circle? put a sharpie in one hand and nail down the other
[06:56:47] <ilikeyou> TimMc: interesting. the ones i saw were dressed. pretty much what you would see at a funeral but without the touch-ups
[06:56:51] <KryptoK> I guess back in the 19th century they did not used formalin.  There was a high demand for fresh cadvers.  The universities were in on the scandal
[06:57:08] <TimMc> ilikeyou: I think it's different when you're cutting them up.
[06:57:35] <KryptoK> The law said that nothing was reallying being stolen because the people were dead and a person had to be alive to be stolen from.

[16:31:37] <piou> Rootkit are absolutely not specific to Linux, and in fact the most malevolent ones embed themselves deeper than the OS such as in the BIOS or firmware
[16:31:38] <Joanna> Sounds like a problem that could be solved with better operating system code
[16:31:59] <Joanna> Ah
[16:32:15] <Joanna> How can they be detected and stopped ?
[16:33:13] <Joanna> Better hardware and firmware design?

A smart card reader is definitely useful, I'd also take a bus pirate assuming you have some basic soldering tools at your disposal, that will allow you to connect directly to the card without possible interference from the smart card reader. If you don't have access to such tools, I guess there are special readers that

[17:13:01] <piou> you can buy and do the same thing but it'll be less versatile and I don't use them so I don't know them. Depending on the card you may also want to look into NFC/RFID (ie: wireless interractions). All that is just to talk with the card. As to what to do from there, most cards will implement some simple protocol that involves cryptographic operations so I'd recommend knowing the basics of RNG,
[17:13:07] <piou> symmetric and assymetric operations, signing and encryption, nothing too deep at first but enough to identify what you need to learn next.

[17:44:58] <TimMc> Joanna: DEET is actually pretty safe, but you can also look into picaridin if you want an alternative. I think it smells much better. :-)
[17:45:45] <TimMc> There's also permethrin, but that's an actual insecticide that just happens to work as a repellant as well. I avoid it because I want to be able to pick up bugs without killing them. :-/
[17:46:06] <Joanna> TimMc: I use a insect repellent in house that smells like peppermint but I can’t find peppermint extract in stores around here or citronella.
[17:46:45] <TimMc> Citronella seems to work OK but I think you need to apply it much more frequently, and I'm not sure it works as broadly as picaridin and deet do.
[17:47:35] <Joanna> I’ve in outside the mosquitoes usually go for my lower legs and feet so I’d use it there
[17:47:45] <TimMc> Also, I've found that whatever you use, you need to smear it around -- sprays aren't sufficient. I've watched mosquitoes repeatedly sort of bounce off my legs until they find an untreated patch of skin. None of them work as airborne repellants.
[17:47:54] <TimMc> so you may as well get a cream
[17:48:47] <Joanna> Some places seem more prone to mosquitoes. I wish people wouldn’t leave things with stagnant water sitting around to breed them.
[17:49:12] <TimMc> I was recently in Florida and I'm pretty sure the mosquitoes were breeding in standing water in curled leaves.
[17:49:21] <TimMc> It doesn't take much.
[17:49:26] <piou> +1
[17:49:31] <TimMc> piou: I went down a "what do people in sunny climates traditionally wear" rabbit hole a couple weeks ago and got *so many* conflicting answers!
[17:49:45] <TimMc> White! Black! Thick! Thin! Breathable! Insulating!
[17:49:58] <piou> TimMc: thing is, it must be taken with context
[17:50:09] <TimMc> I think a big factor is that in a hot, sunny, *dry* climate you want something different than in a humid place.
[17:50:13] <Joanna> I often see large abandoned man made containers full of water..
[17:50:49] <TimMc> Joanna: You can also buy "mosquito dunks" which contain a bacterium that specifically kills mosquito larvae. Toss one in there.
[17:51:01] <TimMc> I throw them up into our gutters. -.-
[17:51:25] <Joanna> They aren’t my containers so I usually don’t get involved.
[17:52:40] <Joanna> TimMc: the best clothing for warm climates is thin woven porous cotton or linen or hemp , light colored
[17:53:07] <piou> Like, if the outside temperature is above 37°C then sure, heavy wool to be as insulating as possible is going to keep you cooler :) Same with black/white clothes, it wouldn't be a good idea to have white clothes against your skin because they're reflecting your own radiations back at you and keeping you warmer than necessary, but as an outside garnment it works well. Also, cities aren't designed
[17:53:09] <TimMc> Yeah, I want to get a few thin, loose, white cotton shirts.
[17:53:13] <piou> in the same way. In most of Europe for example they're terrible for heat: long straight wide roads offer no shadow at all, appartments are designed to let in as much sun as possible without any way to exchange the inside hot air with cooler one... Clothing must take that into account

[17:54:16] <TimMc> I've heard that black outer layers are used to create increased airflow under the garment via convection, but I don't know if I entirely believe it.
[17:54:26] <piou> I had much less trouble with hot climate in Malaysia as I have in France, even though France is both less hot and less humid
[17:54:38] <piou> Oh, that's interesting, I must try that
[17:55:20] <Joanna> I’ve lived in hot climates and never had the urge to wear a sweater on a hot day unless it was soaked with water
[17:57:17] <piou> Joanna: it does sound pretty counter intuitive :) Access to water changes things. The evaporation of water on your skin is cooling, so if you have access to water you want something that breathes, but if you don't and the temperature outside is hotter than your body then simple physics tells us that exposing your body to the outside is heating it -> hence insulation
[17:58:18] <Joanna> TimMc: if you’re outside airflow will not be a problem. Even the act of walking makes airflow. In the house wet clothes do not work in humid climates. Only bare skin and a fan and non cushiony  furniture like hammocks , rattan chairs straw mats on the floor
[17:59:15] <piou> Firefighters were heavy wool for a reason (another one being that wool is suprisingly resistant to catching fire)
[18:00:00] <piou> Airflow is only as good as the water it helps evaporate
[18:00:08] <Joanna> Heavy wool blanket soaked with water would protect from fire until it dries out

[18:02:05] <Joanna> Oh I like airflow
[18:02:10] <piou> It's measurably a bad idea to open windows for airflow when it's hot outside even though many people do it

[18:02:16] <piou> Because airflow doesn't cool you
[18:02:44] <piou> It helps bring dryer air continuously, and the evaporation is what cools you
[18:02:47] <Joanna> Airflow cools me I use fans but I’d prefer a breeze
[18:03:12] <piou> But that's a short term effect easily made useless if you're heating the whole appartment by letting hotter air in

[20:48:25] <bewees> Hydragyrum, Does not persist, rebooted several times, did not encounter it again. Last night the kernel was updated (Tumbleweed updates it frequently, rolling release) so maybe it was a bug from that
[20:49:02] <bewees> ajak, Hopefully not, just worried because last night my internet started to break every minute, so it felt like a network jam
[20:49:20] <Hydragyrum> then it shouldn't be a problem that needs a reinstall or anything, most likely not malware-related
