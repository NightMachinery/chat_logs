[01:10:34] <gwern> 'In one noncomputer test, we asked students about vision when presenting them with different visual referents, namely a shining light bulb, the same bulb unlit, and a white Styrofoam ball approximately the same size as the unlit bulb (Winer, Cottrell, Karefilaki, & Chronister, 1996). We expected that referring to the lit bulb would diminish extramission responses—indeed, that it would be...
[01:10:40] <gwern> ...nearly impossible to maintain extramission beliefs in reference to light shining in one’s face. We also assumed that initial intromission responses, encouraged by reference to the shining light bulb, would generalize. That is, we expected positive transfer from questions about the shining light bulb to subsequent questions about the non luminous objects. The results supported the idea...
[01:10:46] <gwern> ...that asking i-e questions about a shining light would cause a decrease in extramis sion responses. But asking about the lit bulb did not even come close to eliminating extramission beliefs: 33% of the adults tested affirmed extramission in reference to viewing the lit bulb. Moreover, there was no sign of positive trans fer from questions about the lit bulb to questions about the...
[01:10:52] <gwern> ...nonluminous objects. In fact, the opposite occurred. When we switched from the lit bulb to the nonluminous objects, there was an increase in extramission responses, as if turning off the light signaled that there were no more incoming rays' http://people.auc.ca/brodbeck/4007/article7.pdf#page=4 heh

[01:11:11] <gwern> 'In one pilot study, for example, when we were trying to explore the breadth of the extramission misunder standing, one participant tenaciously defended his extra mission beliefs until we asked him whether someone would be able to see the image coming from his eyes, at which point he acknowledged, rather sheepishly, that nothing has to leave the eyes in order for people to see.'

[01:17:30] <pompolic> i also noticed it was not closed properly
[01:17:59] <pompolic> this was due to chunks of ice deposited on the rim of the fridge door, preventing the magnets from making contact properly

[02:57:59] <kuudes> james bond indeed
[02:58:21] <gwern> but it also makes sense. the sheer volatility and occasional high stock prices of tesla indicated everyone regarded it as an extreme growth story with a ton of risk: the risk has now largely vanished (how could tesla *not* be one of the most valuable car companies in the world at this point, even if FSD is a total bust)

[03:06:12] <gwern> that is, at this point, now that tesla is shipping millions of still-highly-rated cars a year, all those teslaq criticisms about 'the fit and finish is sloppy' or 'they have $x billion in loans coming due next year' all are obviously wrong and irrelevant and nonfatal
[03:06:47] <gwern> musk could've fucked it up. he could've fired the wrong person on ambien, finally tweeted something too far, a supplychain bottleneck could've killed the supply of batteries dead, or something. but... it didn't

[03:51:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> TP-Link Archer A7
[03:51:49] <kiboneu> ah im familiar with this one
[03:51:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seeing issues on imgur, Google Maps, WoW
[03:51:59] <kiboneu> openwrt or stock fw?
[03:52:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Stock
[03:52:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why
[03:52:18] <kiboneu> hm. i've used it only with openwrt
[03:52:41] <kiboneu> however, hardware-wise i don't see a clear pathology to your symptoms
[03:53:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I dunno. It's odd, I've never seen an issue quite like this one
[03:53:08] <kiboneu> some routers use two cores of two different architectures (!) and sometimes there are performance issues with that
[03:53:59] <kiboneu> (not because of the hetergeneity of architectures, but because of the way packets get forwarded from one core to another, essentially internally serialized through a socket in an internal NAT)
[03:54:22] <kiboneu> what does iperf say?
[03:54:41] <pompolic> i would be surprised if the stock firmware wasn't an ancient openwrt fork (but that's neither here nor there)
[03:55:32] <kiboneu> try a LAN-LAN xfer, check for losses, then try a LAN-WAN xfer with a server you control within the state, and see if you can further characterize the loss from your iperf results
[03:55:57] <saturn2> this is what you should expect from a consumer-grade router
[03:57:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I've owned many consumer-grade routers and it's definitely not true that all or even most of them will do stuff like this
[03:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> This router I got is just an updated version of the one I already had
[03:57:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu: What is iperf
[03:57:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu: Also what do you mean by "check for losses"?
[03:57:49] <saturn2> i guess you've been lucky
[03:58:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: No I've just gotten routers that are well-reviewed etc.
[03:58:07] <kiboneu> fwiw i had no failures with openwrt on tp-link routers (not counting hardware  failures that'd likely occur regardless of firmware
[03:58:09] <kiboneu> )

[03:58:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm not opposed to switching to openwrt but I've used TP-Links for quite a few years now on stock firmware and have not had trouble of this nature

[03:59:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I agree, which is why I got this router instead of a model from, say, anytime in the last five years
[04:00:06] <saturn2> i see
[04:01:00] <pompolic> googling the CPU landed me on this page which is a bit beyond my pay grade (as they run freebsd on it) https://bsdmag.org/qca9558/

[04:01:19] <pompolic> probably too low level to be of use
[04:01:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> If anyone is curious, TP-Link actually runs emulators of all of their router firmwares on their website
[04:01:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> So this is the Archer C7/A7: https://emulator.tp-link.com/archer-c7-v5/index.html

[04:03:02] <kiboneu> wait... i hope it's not the latter
[04:03:38] <pompolic> the firmware updates are usually one squashfs blob
[04:03:41] <pompolic> I'm assuming the former
[04:05:33] <kiboneu> assumptions are dangerous weapons
[04:06:12] <pompolic> they make a new disk image to change a default password

[04:22:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, I guess the LAN-LAN test isn't showing anything interesting
[04:22:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't have a server I control within the state (or anywhere else) for a LAN-WAN test

[05:24:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> So apparently the von Mises for whom this distribution is half-named is no less than the younger brother of Ludwig von Mises
[05:25:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Although best known for his mathematical work, Mises also contributed to the philosophy of science as a neo-positivist and empiricist, following the line of Ernst Mach. Historians of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricism recognize a "first phase" from 1907 through 1914 with Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, and Otto Neurath.[citation needed][3] His older brother, Ludwig von Mises, held an opposite point of view with respect to
[05:25:08] <Obormot\Arcturus>  positivism and epistemology. His brother developed praxeology, an a priori view.[4]"

[06:51:56] <nshepperd2> diffusion (ddpm) on the stylegan3 latent space
[06:52:29] <nshepperd2> seems to work. not sure if any value compared to straight optimization though 
[06:52:57] <nshepperd2> besides the theoretical advantage of representing a sample from the posterior
[06:54:54] <gwern> I would be dubious. what makes a stylegan latent space a real posterior in the first place?
[06:55:07] <gwern> seems like it would have to be a bad one, with the mode-dropping etc
[06:56:57] <nshepperd2> i mean it's a sample from the posterior of the clip conditioning, with the prior being whatever distribution stylegan3 represents
[06:58:51] <gwern> so the CLIP is the likelihood? but if you start with a bad prior and multiply by a good likelihood you still get a bad posterior... and if the prior mode-drops (assigns zero probability?) then a good likelihood can never fix it
[06:59:11] <nshepperd2> yes
[06:59:46] <nshepperd2> presumably the stylegan latent space is not a great approximation to the actual distribution of the dataset
[07:00:25] <gwern> wonder how you could fix mode-dropping. maybe reverse-encode the entire trainingdataset and put dirac masses on each one?
[07:00:55] <gwern> welp, probably not a big deal. after all, you can usually always project into almost the same image, so it must hve a nonzero prior
[07:03:07] *** Quits: spxtr (~spxtr@user/spxtr) (Quit: leaving)
[07:03:38] <nshepperd2> if you could reverse encode the entire train set into z then you could like train a diffusion model or something on zs
[07:03:54] <nshepperd2> to get a distribution on z that covers all the modes better than N(0,I)
[07:08:45] <gwern> strange hybrid. so it's a smoothed average between the data-spikes and the original N(0,1)?
[07:08:58] <gwern> a diffusion-boosted GAN?
[07:10:47] <nshepperd2> yeah basically
[07:10:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok... knock on wood, my connectivity issues seem to have cleared up on their own

[09:50:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> brb becoming enlightened
[09:50:32] <saturn2> firefox isn't really a first-class browser anymore
[09:51:40] <Obormot\Gaia> So the book starts with an introduction that tells the history of Zen, which is already amusing:
[09:52:13] <Obormot\Gaia> “Missionaries continued to bring [Buddhist] scriptures to China [from India], but centuries passed before translations of these scriptures became genuinely intelligible, and before the Chinese were able to see Buddhism for what it was, a detailed proposal to teach mankind how to escape from life's inescapable sufferings by escaping from life itself.
[09:52:14] <Obormot\Gaia> When this message and its practical consequences became clear, traditionally minded Chinese protested. To them, the monks, who lived on charity, were no more than parasites. To them, the monks' celibacy and shift of allegiance from family and emperor to religious master and monastery were endangering the survival of society. Furthermore, they said, the monks, though supposedly indifferent to worldly things, were accumulating
[09:52:14] <Obormot\Gaia>  monastic wealth and power.”
[09:54:22] <Obormot\Gaia> On the reason for the survival of the Zen variant of Buddhism despite a period of official persecution of Buddhism in general by the Chinese government (in the 9th century):
[09:54:47] <Obormot\Gaia> “Finally, in spite of an express scriptural prohibition which forbade Buddhist monks to farm the land, because a farmer necessarily destroys plants and other living things, the Zen novitiates worked as farmers. Zen accepted the motto, 'One day no work, one day no food.' Zen diligence thus answered the accusation of parasitism and, in any case, helped to maintain the Zen community.”
[09:56:50] <quanticle> saturn2: Was Firefox ever a first-class browser
[09:57:00] <Obormot\Gaia> “It was [a 17th century monk named Hakuin] and his pupils who devised the training method embodied in this book, and it was the tradition stemming from him that established, not only the kind and sequence of koans to be used in training, but also the 'rightness' of the answers that are given here.” ... interesting
[09:57:14] <quanticle> From my recollection Firefox was always, at best, a second class browser
[09:57:16] <linear> for a few good years, maybe
[09:57:16] <Obormot\Gaia> (sorry, more like 18th century)

[09:58:10] <linear> if by first-class you just mean #1 popularity, yeah, that was it for a lot of people, but I think it was, a relatively-better-than-all-competitors product around that time

[10:54:59] <quanticle> "One case study, from 2007, documented a twenty-four-year-old male patient who had slipped into 'a short-lasting acute psychotic state' during 'an unguided and intense' meditation session. He was referred to clinicians following the onset of 'an acute sensation of being mentally split.' He saw vivid colors, hallucinated, and was overcome with severe anxiety. At the height of the episode, he was
[10:55:01] <quanticle> tormented by 'delusional convictions that he had caused the end of the world' and talked of suicide. The man had experienced one previous hypomanic episode and had a history of untreated depression. The authors posited that 'meditation can act as a stressor in vulnerable patients.'"
[10:55:09] <quanticle> Sounds like someone we've heard of

[16:49:16] <kiboneu> zen koans, two2thehead?
[16:50:22] <kiboneu> Obormot\Gaia: looks like the problem partially resolved itself? that's good. nenver know what the chinesium routers are up to sometimes
[16:51:12] <kiboneu> w.r.t. meditation, I'
[16:52:34] <kiboneu> I've tried it. I'm immune to it. I tried drugs too but while they do funny things to my senses and thought-chains they don't really get me into a quiet meditatiive state. I guess I'm wired for suffering haha
[16:53:41] <kiboneu> but i guess i should embrace that
[16:56:19] <pompolic> i can meditate
[16:57:08] <pompolic> in fact i'm fairly sure i gradient descent'd into something like that when i was young
[16:57:47] <pompolic> the specific part i'm thinking of is when they say things like "observe the thoughts coming and going" or some shit
[16:57:50] <pompolic> i was doing that
[16:57:58] <kiboneu> my terrain has become fractured and rocky
[16:58:05] <kiboneu> for gradient descent
[16:58:19] <pompolic> >tfw adulthood
[16:58:42] <pompolic> anyway it contributes to why i don't like, hmm
[16:58:50] <pompolic> maybe i don't dislike all of buddhism
[16:59:00] <kiboneu> i can certainly observe thoughts and feelings and use these signal constantly, but it certainly does not put me in a rested state
[16:59:29] <kiboneu> it just pops levels of meta-cognition
[16:59:41] <kiboneu> to deal with / play with
[17:00:06] <kiboneu> i don't dislike all of biuddhism either
[17:00:22] <pompolic> the one benefit i derived from it is noticing that the valence of my experiences is another layer my brain adds semi-automatically
[17:00:26] <pompolic> i can fuck around with that
[17:00:32] <kiboneu> it's kind of a good principle. to be mindful of what one thinks (as much as of what one says / does)
[17:01:12] <pompolic> there's also tantric buddhism which does a different kind of meditation afaik
[17:01:42] <pompolic> they are not doing the insufferable "reject worldly things" schtick
[17:02:36] <kiboneu> yeah
[17:02:49] <kiboneu> there's also the neutered alan watts buddhism
[17:02:59] <kiboneu> or whoever his teacher was
[17:03:15] <kiboneu> er, neutered is a strong word
[17:03:33] <kiboneu> but filtered against the mythos
[17:03:50] <kiboneu> concetrated buddhism
[17:04:05] <pompolic> buddhism salts
[17:04:09] <kiboneu> heh
[17:08:46] <kiboneu> i daydream a lot though
[17:10:06] <pompolic> me too
[17:10:18] <pompolic> i was going to suggest that is related, but i'm not sure
[17:10:40] <kiboneu> (i was reading backlog about prisoners daydreaming and whatnot)
[17:10:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I read "tantric buddhism" as "tactical buddhism" and was suddenly interested

[17:20:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, I see
[17:21:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unfortunately that's a totally useless suggestion, but I understand
[17:21:47] <mst> almost certainly, but (a) I'm still caffeinating after waking up (b) since when did you expect to me try and actually be helpful ?
[17:21:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[17:22:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> For the record, I have absolutely tried this
[17:22:21] <mst> more seriously though, if "whatever piece of shit your ISP sent you" doesn't have enough features
[17:22:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Got myself one of them mini PC thingies, installed pfsense (I am fairly sure that's what it's called)
[17:22:41] <mst> putting a more intelligent box of *some* sort in front of it is often the best way forwards
[17:22:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It turned out to be total shit
[17:23:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Right, yes, the question is precisely "what sort of box"
[17:23:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not use an ISP-provided router currently (well, the modem can be a router if it wanted to, I guess, but I have it in "bridge mode" or w/e so it's just a modem)
[17:23:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I use a consumer-grade wifi router
[17:23:50] <PapuaHardyNet> wait, if you are still using the POS your ISP sent you, aren't you still using a potentially compromised device?
[17:23:52] <mst> the problem here is all the 'friendly' GUIs make me want to stab myself in the scrotum with a rusty fork
[17:24:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I am not using it
[17:24:12] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: perfect description of how I feel
[17:24:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: In this case the problem is precisely the opposite
[17:24:27] <mst> oh?
[17:24:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> The GUI is fine but the hardware (and/or drivers?) is flaky
[17:24:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or maybe just formerly-flaky (fingers crossed)
[17:25:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu and saturn2 have alluded to consumer-grade router hardware being generally shitty, which I am totally willing to believe as a general fact (where the actual box I have falls on that spectrum remains to be seen)
[17:25:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> So my question is "ok then what instead"
[17:25:48] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot: perhaps what you need is some enterprise grade router hardware?
[17:25:51] <mst> so, OpenBSD (rather than FreeBSD which is apparently what you installed) tends to have better networking drivers
[17:25:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Do you have specific recommendations?
[17:26:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: I understand, but back up: OpenBSD installed on *what*
[17:26:16] <mst> but also for hardware to throw a BSD at for routing, I don't know off the top of my head what's currently recommended, I just know who I'd ask
[17:26:18] <PapuaHardyNet> no, sorry
[17:26:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Well, if you ever have a chance to ask that person/people, I'd be curious to hear their view(s)
[17:26:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> No rush because the thing I have seems to be working for now
[17:27:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> To be clear, again, the question is: I have a consumer-grade wifi router, and it is (let's say for the sake of argument) acting flaky in some way, so we've decided to replace it with something better / more reliable / more performant / etc. What should be that something?
[17:28:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: That having been said, just saying "OpenBSD" is almost maximally unhelpful, even setting aside the hardware question
[17:28:43] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[17:29:09] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: if I was setting up such a thing, I'd figure out well supported hardware and then configure the whole thing from the command line because I'd want to know exactly what it's doing
[17:29:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, this is an obvious thing to say, but: going from "install OpenBSD" to "your router does all the stuff you want it" is a process that's multiple orders of magnitude more complex and time-consuming and failure-prone than going from "plug in a consumer-grade router" to <same desired outcome>
[17:29:49] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot: what went wrong with your router build btw
[17:30:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Well, there's the rub: I also *want to know exactly what it's doing*, but the challenge here is going from "want it to do <list of things>" to "it does those things"; the mapping from "what is it doing" to "what do I know about what it's doing" is a *separate* issue, however desirable it may be
[17:30:37] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: yes, but that's precisely -why- I'd do it the infinitely hard way because I wouldn't trust the GUIs not to demonstrate the failure-prone part in an opaque way at the most inconvenient possible moment
[17:31:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Yeah, there's that "infinitely hard" part that kind of undermines this plan :p
[17:31:10] <mst> well, all you said was 'router'
[17:31:22] <mst> given a more specific list of things I might be able to offer a less vague answer
[17:31:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Technically I said "wifi router" :p
[17:32:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> What I am alluding to is the fact that your average "TP-Link brand thingie you plug into your home cable internet to do internet stuff for your devices" does all sorts of things, beyond *literally* just routing packets from one subnet to another

[17:34:27] <mst> honestly I wouldn't be surprised if "pfsense on hardware it actually likes" wouldn't work nicely
[17:34:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> In a consumer-grade router with its standard firmware GUI (or even in, say, dd-wrt), this is a matter of going to a URL in your web browser and clicking the "do this thing" checkbox and maybe typing in some port numbers into some fields and clicking "ok"
[17:34:42] <mst> I shall ask T'Wench when she wakes up
[17:35:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> In an OpenBSD setup, it's <literally weeks of hell trying to figure out how to set up obscure, incomprehensible Unix bullshit>
[17:35:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just like every other non-trivial thing (and many trivial things) that one might want to do with a *nix system
[17:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: pfsense, when I tried it a couple years back, literally didn't even have half the features I wanted
[17:35:55] <mst> well, probably a solid weekend at best, but OTOH once you'd done that, it would do exactly what you told it to, which isn't something that can generally be said for the shiny things

[17:36:23] <PapuaHardyNet> just hire an openbsd guy to fix things for you
[17:36:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not unless it's being done by someone who *already knows* how to do all this stuff
[17:36:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> In detail
[17:37:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Just consider the fact that we're talking about doing wifi stuff, on a *nix system. That, by itself, is automatically a signal that shit's gonna be weird and complicated and may very well just not ever work right, period
[17:38:17] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: what about openwrt - have you tried it, what do you think about it
[17:38:24] <mst> took me about an hour last time on an rpi to get it autocnnecting to all the different networks I wanted it to
[17:38:42] <PapuaHardyNet> man obormot, you really hate *nixes. 
[17:38:50] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: no, he doesn't
[17:38:54] <mst> please don't be a dick
[17:40:13] <PapuaHardyNet> ? how am I a dick for pointing out someone's dislike for an OS family
[17:40:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: So to answer your question, what went wrong with my attempted BSD-based router build is that every single detail of every single thing that I tried to make the system do, from the very basics onward, was not even slightly simple nor intuitive, things failed to work for no clear reason, it was apparently impossible to get some of the features I wanted, and it was never possible to be sure whether I'd fucked up
[17:40:24] <Obormot\Arcturus>  somehow or whether the drivers were failing to do things right or what, because there was also no parseable feedback on anything
[17:40:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I spent considerable time on this, too!
[17:41:14] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: firstly, if you spend enough time with Obormot you'll discover that he's this critical of basically every piece of software ever
[17:42:13] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: secondly, responding to somebody pointing out (correctly) that certain things can be a pain in the arse to configure is not 'hating' and reacting by blaming the person's emotional state rather than considering the possibility that, actually, this stuff is not that easy if you don't do it as a day job, is being a dick
[17:42:17] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, that sounds painful. honestly I'm considering paying someone to build and send me a router with openbsd or openwrt
[17:42:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, I did ultimately end up leaving that box as a ... hm, I want to say ubuntu? Not actually sure now ... machine... and installing pihole on it, and using it as my pihole server. And that went ... relatively painlessly. It worked for a while and then at some point ... stopped working and I haven't had a chance to fix it.
[17:42:42] <mst> PapuaHardyNet: if you can't understand that, I suggest never having an opinion about linux/unix around non-sysadmins again, because you'll just make the rest of us look bad
[17:43:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, I *did* actually, in fact, use a *nix box as my primary router / NAT box / etc. for a while
[17:43:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> A looong time ago
[17:43:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was a Beige G3 (which I still have!) running, at the time, Yellow Dog Linux PPC
[17:43:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> It served in that capacity for a solid several years
[17:43:58] <mst> mmmm, nostalgia
[17:44:01] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: yeah you should stop being so emotional for obormot. I wouldn't be this overbearing around other people.
[17:44:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm sure he didn't mind or think of me as a dick
[17:44:22] * mst sighs
[17:44:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> ok, ok, no need to fight over me, I can do that myself :p
[17:45:04] <mst> trying to explain basic social skills to people who don't actually want to learn anything is pretty futile anyway, so yeah, let's move on
[17:45:29] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: oh gods now I'm having flashbacks to the time I looked at the webmin source code
[17:45:36] <mst> it's perl ... technically ...
[17:45:53] <mst> but, uh, *ow*
[17:46:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: So anyhow, I would certainly be curious to hear the opinion of a pro on this, although I will say in advance that in practice, the kind of recommendation that I'm likely to end up implementing is gonna be like "buy <brand/model of router>, possibly install <dd-wrt or some similar shit> on it"; if the recommendation is instead "fuck around with unix crap directly" then my answer will be "thank you but I will not be doing

[17:57:40] <PapuaHardyNet> okay so think of this: the value of a cryptocurrency directly correlates with the knowledge and value that people holding it assign to it
[17:58:05] <PapuaHardyNet> this is what we could call the asset-specific risk
[17:58:54] <PapuaHardyNet> actually that's a subset of the asset-specific risk
[17:59:37] <PapuaHardyNet> now, if we assume that the value of the USD directly correlates with the macroeconomic risk, then stablecoins are ones that have close to zero asset-specific risk (ideal stablecoins that is)

[20:58:16] <adiabatic> or you can go for the two-cubes approach: https://www.amazon.com/Tungsten-Cube-Free-Purchase/dp/B012YE3MC2/https://www.amazon.com/Tungsten-Cube-Free-Purchase/dp/B012YE3MC2/

[20:58:30] <rmmh> The greatest weight ever raised by a human being is 6,270 lbs. in a back lift (weight lifted off trestles) by 364- lb. Paul Anderson (U.S.) (b. 1932), the 1956 Olympic heavyweight champion, at Toccoa, Georgia, on June 12, 1957
[20:59:03] <rmmh> adiabatic: just buy that 305 times and make your own
[20:59:59] <PapuaHardyNet> use superglue
[21:00:37] <adiabatic> 501 kg? yeah, that sounds about right for someone named "half Thor"
[21:01:47] <rmmh> adiabatic: he's a demigod
[21:02:02] <gwern> https://barbend.com/weight-humans-back-lift/ huh. I admit, that's not what I expected the greatest-weight-lifted to look like

[21:02:39] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: oh, actually you can get it physically;   'The minimum bid is 47.74 ETH, currently equivalent to $201,295.23. According to the listing, the only way to take physical possession of the cube will be to burn the NFT, meaning send it to a dead-end address so it can no longer be traded.'
[21:03:12] <rmmh> I am slightly more confident that midwest tungsten won't accidentally lose a 2000lb cube than the average NFT, so this is Good, Actually
[21:03:23] <gwern> oh, and it comes with options:   'Burning the NFT will result in shipment to the most recent owner via freight truck, owner will be responsible for alerting Midwest Tungsten Service of the intention to burn and transport after freight drop-off. During each annual visit or once annually while the cube is stored with Midwest Tungsten Service, options for replacing the cube with a larger size...
[21:03:29] <gwern> ...(if available, based on improved manufacturing capabilities) will be presented to the current NFT holder. Owner can choose to accept or decline options presented by Midwest Tungsten Service.'
[21:04:12] <PapuaHardyNet> i don't get it. you can't even show off the cube. it is a huge chunk of metal
[21:04:21] <rmmh> (what does it feel like to touch a 14" tungsten cube? well, basically the same as a 14" steel cube. it's an immovable object."
[21:04:22] <PapuaHardyNet> why would you want an even bigger chunk of metal

[21:19:23] <kuudes> hmm. why are winter tires so expensive? is there a reason to buy tesla's 1950 e tires instead of 300-600 e tires from shop?
[21:19:43] <ggreer> I bought another set of wheels and put winter tires on those
[21:20:49] <kuudes> yeah, it is talking about the wheels there. so the wheels + tires cost 1950 e? hmm
[21:20:53] <rmmh> ggreer: with a wider gap it scales
[21:21:15] <rmmh> just because we have 60mm IPD doesn't mean your camera system has to
[21:23:39] <ggreer> kuudes: tesla's winter tires are probably overpriced, though it might be because they're low profile tires. it was only slightly more expensive for me to get separate wheels + winter tires than to get low profile winter tires 
[21:24:13] <ggreer> instead of 20" wheels with low profile tires, my winter setup is 19" wheels with normal-ish sidewalls
[21:24:29] <ggreer> most 18" wheels are too small to fit over the disc brakes
[21:25:28] <kuudes> hmm, so 19" would be the normal?
[21:25:45] <ggreer> I think it's different for the non-performance versions. they have smaller brakes
[21:26:10] <ggreer> that said, teslas are all wheel drive and have pretty good traction control. unless you're in some rather wild conditions, all season tires are probably fine
[21:26:38] <ggreer> I got winter tires because my car came with summer tires that will crack and disintegrate below 30F
[21:27:05] <kuudes> if I would want to have a nice and nonoffensive city car, which tesla should I consider?
[21:27:21] <ggreer> probably the model 3 standard range
[21:27:24] <kuudes> over here winter tires are mandatory on winter
[21:27:36] <ggreer> or model y if you want more space
[21:27:58] <kuudes> you are allowed to choose between grip and spikes, spikes are the more common here, but have the downside of more noise and creation of particulate emissions
[21:28:10] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "As noted, justice sensitivity is a stable and generalizable individual difference in peoples' readiness to perceive and react to injustice (Baumert & Schmitt, 2016) that ostensibly reflects differential concern for justice (Baumert et al., 2013). Researchers further differentiate between one's sensitivity to being a victim, an outside observer, a passive beneficiary, or a perpetrator of injustice. Empirical evidence confirms 
[21:28:10] <two2thehead> that these four assumed perspectives of justice sensitivity are distinguishable and are reliably assessed with separate scales (Schmitt, Baumert, Gollwitzer, & Maes, 2010; Schmitt et al., 2005)."
[21:28:19] <kuudes> hmm, thanks ggreer
[21:28:30] <two2thehead> I will bet you a dollar that Scott Alexander scores high on justice sensitivity
[21:28:46] <ggreer> oh. the standard range is rear wheel drive

[21:58:21] <Robomot> Is College Worth It? A Comprehensive Return on Investment Analysis | by Preston Cooper | Oct, 2021 | FREOPP.org (Most students attend college in order to get a better job with a higher salary. But the financial returns to college vary widely depending on the institution a student attends and the subject he or…)
[22:00:09] <gwern> 'For students who graduate on time, the median bachelor’s degree has a net ROI of $306,000. But some degrees are worth millions of dollars, while others have no net financial value at all. After accounting for the risk of dropping out, ROI for the median bachelor’s degree drops to $129,000. Over a quarter of programs have negative ROI. Four in five engineering programs have ROI above...
[22:00:15] <gwern> ...$500,000, but the same is true for just 1% of psychology programs. Elite schools such as Caltech and Penn dominate the list of highest ROI programs. But attending an elite school is not a golden ticket; some Ivy League degrees have negative ROI.'
[22:01:49] <rmmh> they have the raw data at the bottom if you want to slice more
[22:02:35] * gwern is unsure how to feel about this. on the one hand, it's inherently correlational and untrustworthy. on the other hand, it makes education look bad and one would expect correlations to underestimate the harm and overestimate gains.
[22:03:23] <rmmh> it's unsurprising to me that roughly 1/3 of college majors are negative ROI
[22:03:29] <galambo> how about the more intangible benefits?
[22:03:33] <galambo> like social
[22:03:42] <rmmh> delaying the rat race by ~5 years?
[22:04:02] <galambo> that one too. college seems to be more fun than work
[22:04:18] <gwern> rmmh: delaying real life and doing madeup makework in academia?
[22:04:40] <gwern> you don't hear about students' mental health *improving* by going to grad school rather than getting a real job doing actual work of value to other people...
[22:04:41] <galambo> also college seems to be an american construct. why dont you guys just go straight to university?
[22:05:02] <rmmh> they're the same thing
[22:05:49] <galambo> ah ok. I thought you need to do a meaningless 4 year course before you apply to something else
[22:06:02] <rmmh> that's only true for law and medicine
[22:06:14] <rmmh> and that 4-year course isn't _quite_ meaningless
[22:06:23] <galambo> ah I see. I thought that was universal
[22:09:47] <mst> 'college' is what americans call universities
[22:10:02] <mst> the 4 year course is the equivalent of a BSc/BA
[22:10:05] <kuudes> are they limited to bachelors?
[22:10:05] <galambo> in egypt I think going to college is probably very good for you. particularly if you get a qualification that is in demand in other countries
[22:10:12] <galambo> university*
[22:11:25] <mst> galambo: so unless you only think a masters or a phd counts, then, yeah, it's not an american construct
[22:11:53] <mst> doing 4 years instead of 3 and requiring a bunch of random courses unrelated to your actual subject is mostly an americanism though
[22:12:09] <kuudes> over here universities general graduate masters and onward, applied universities graduate bachelors

[23:04:52] <rsaarelm> Dresden Codak characters are Kimiko, the nuclear twins who don't show up in the current arc, the Victorian guys who live on the moon, and random NPCs who don't have object permanence from one strip to another. I find the current Dresden Codak arc confusing.
[23:05:05] <PapuaHardyNet> rmmh: you are right!
[23:06:15] <PapuaHardyNet> I overestimate how much Subaru should blend in given his lack of powers, but then again, it took rather little time for Emilia and Rem to trust him (in the final timeline)

[23:12:07] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I *really* like the final timeline version of Re Zero. Subaru is decisive, rational, and even considers abandoning Emilia instead of blindly simping for her
[23:17:07] <feepbot> <gwern> 'That was circa 2009, when she was “an asshole and a jerk,” Egan says. But that wasn’t the only thing that was different about Egan back then: She had been assigned male at birth and raised as a boy. Married with three children, Egan took pride in her college-frat bona fides and harsh management style. She was a tech bro—a successful one, raising $7 million in
[23:17:07] <feepbot> investments for the tech-sales company she founded. Sure, it was the product of hard work, but it was nothing more than she—presenting as a straight white man—thought she deserved. Or so she thought. When Egan began transitioning at 38, and started a second business as a woman, she was in for a rude awakening. Despite her years of experience, once she transitioned, Egan says
[23:17:07] <feepbot> investors didn’t take her seriously; men talked over her, and she struggled, sometimes literally, to find space at the table. “I remember being in shock, and thinking, ‘Oh, this is what women have been talking about the whole time,’” she says.' https://www.elle.com/life-love/a37507807/0106-0108-corporate-transition-october-2021/ /sailer intensifies

[23:19:24] <PapuaHardyNet> what does "/sailer" mean btw
[23:20:15] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: what means "final timeline"? timeline by end of the series?
[23:25:02] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: that's right, the timeline that leads up to the end of the series

[23:25:26] <PapuaHardyNet> well, season 1 specifically. the video doesn't consider season 2 afaik
[23:25:38] *** Joins: srhm (~srhm@user/srhm)
[23:25:40] <PapuaHardyNet> and season 2 obviously has multiple timelines since Subaru is a time looper
