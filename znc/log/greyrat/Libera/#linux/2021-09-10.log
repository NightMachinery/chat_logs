I have a kernel (liquorix on debian) with a compiled-in cmdline parameter (CONFIG_CMDLINE) that disables audit (audit=0). is there a way to override this without recompiling the kernel? I tried adding audit=1 to grub's GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, but it was just appended to the cmdline and systemd's "!audit=0" condition of the auditd service still failed.
[02:06:49] <kurbitz> SmaskingX: I think the -r option just prints the result

[04:16:40] <GoodCrossing> Hi all, I have a question, I'm trying to compare two lines of a text file containing 1s and 0s (it's not a binary file, these are ASCII 1s and 0s), so that if the nth character of both lines matches (i.e is 1 or 0 on both), the nth line of the result is 1, otherwise, 0. So if I have 1010 and 1101, the output should be 1000. Is there an easy way to
[04:16:40] <GoodCrossing> do this with a oneliner or something or would I need to script this properly?

[05:01:45] <phogg> No1x3r0: they make packages by very carefully describing dependencies in a config language, this then lets them create the runtime environment for a program which is for all intents and purposes isolated from other programs and will not conflict with their libraries (nor vice versa).

[06:24:49] <sudomann> [[R]]: unfortunately no. That socket just being there doesnt mean its is "ready"
[06:24:50] <kfrench> I would think a unix domain socket wouldn't connect to another docker unless they were sharing the same IPC space.

[06:25:34] <[[R]]> sudomann: yes what
[06:25:35] <phogg> sudomann: your daemon must positively react to becoming ready by making a state change that can be seen externally, whether that is sending an event, writing to a file, or what have you
[06:25:51] <sudomann> yes, its a different docker than the one on the host
[06:25:53] <phogg> sudomann: apart from that the only way to test for readiness is to contact the daemon and see if it responds normally
[06:25:56] <sudomann> docker-in-docker :)

[06:26:08] <sudomann> but docker --version should do i think
[06:26:10] <[[R]]> how many doker deamons do you need
[06:26:17] <phogg> sudomann: all of these things are necessarily not generics, so there are no real generic answers
[06:26:43] <phogg> there are sometimes *common* answers for programs that happen to all work the same way (e.g. the aforementioned systemd readiness protocol)
[06:27:22] <sudomann> well, I made staeful vms for people to use. It runs in the nested docker instance, and its /var/lib/docker is saved
[06:27:51] <sudomann> si initial command is `docker run` and after that always `docker start`
[06:28:13] <sudomann> just to give devs a little workspace in the cluster to directly play with resources :D

[08:52:54] <MinusOne> sumthing1980, if you are serious about building your own server, how is the hosting going to work? Are you allowed by your ISP to run servers? Or have you found a cohosting location?

[08:54:36] <MinusOne> sumthing1980, that doesn't answer the question of whether they allow servers. You can risk it, but it would be smart to know first

[08:54:55] <MinusOne> cheapest at scale is definitely cloud

[08:55:00] <mlu> sumthing1980: it depends on your definition of cheapest
[08:55:05] <rud0lf> like '[a-f0-9]' would match a sha256sum

[11:35:36] <rovanion> One of the workloads that run on my cluster manages to kill itself by causing a lot of TLB Shootdowns and Function Call Interrupts stalling the entire machine while its just processing interrupts.
[11:35:41] <hkm> Is it because I have to write the name of the key differently?

[14:20:04] <BoraxMan> Perhaps, but I could learn FVWM, and make scripts that I can use, learn shell scripting, learn to use the tools to solve problems I have, to make better workflows
[14:20:05] <martti> F-00: arch, right now
[14:20:39] <F-00> vanilla?
[14:20:58] <BoraxMan> codecolla, perhaps, but I personally don't have that need now.  I would gain from learning how to automate things.  Learning FVWM script, combined with shell scripting and dmenu has allowed me to make lots of little convieniences that I use day to day
[14:21:10] <martti> well yup, the details are actually at the top of the xorg logfile that's contained in the paste

Traffic is getting to the Wireguard Server. But it is not routed over the Wireguard Interface on the Serve. I set up a masquerade rule with `sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wg0 -j MASQUERADE`. This sould be all which is needed right? I also

[16:04:10] <mzajc> greetings! I have a kernel (liquorix on debian) with a compiled-in cmdline parameter (CONFIG_CMDLINE) that disables audit (audit=0). is there a way to override this without recompiling the kernel? I tried adding audit=1 to grub's GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, but it was just appended to the cmdline and systemd's "!audit=0" condition of the auditd service still failed.

I replaced one of those ancient+backport=still_trash 2.6.x kernels with a 4.something long ago, and lvm would fail... so in initramfs hooks, I just added basically a 'lvm pvscan' and that fixed it. And in a later version I was testing something (was a firmware bug) and with the vanilla kernel, windows guests needed some special option, but everything worked. (since I'm

[17:26:11] <simbaclaws> so I can make a nice report

[18:06:08] <simbaclaws> Psi-Jack I spoke to my boss and proposed setting up a server ourselves or using a provider that allows root access, and he said we have a old server here at work that we can use for local development and then use our shared hosting server with a read only solution
[18:06:19] <simbaclaws> he does not want to get off the idea of not having a shared hosting server
[18:06:38] <simbaclaws> the development machine is a windows serve

[18:07:13] <Psi-Jack> Problem is...
[18:07:20] <simbaclaws> the shared hosting server
[18:07:22] <simbaclaws> xD
[18:07:24] <Psi-Jack> The shared hosting is never able to BE a "read only" version

[18:07:58] <simbaclaws> there is no solution I know
[18:08:04] <Psi-Jack> simbaclaws: The way it even works is, the webserver runs executable code AS the user that owns it.

[18:10:01] <peetaur> you can make the most exposed things read only...run your web server confined or in a container that is a read only

[18:10:28] <simbaclaws> I can run a server from my own network I guess

[18:11:47] <simbaclaws> yeah, I'm thinking about putting down a server for virtual machines or something

[18:11:58] <peetaur> vm read only as in the virtual disk can be written outside the VM, but the vm/hypervisor accesses it in some read only way

[18:20:50] <simbaclaws> oh wow

[18:20:55] <simbaclaws> I didn't check the phenoms
[18:20:58] <peetaur> there's not a huge difference between server and desktop until you look at the differences: redundant power supplies, ECC RAM, IPMI interface, max RAM, PCI bandwidth (need some 40Gbps network? lots of nvme or whatever), etc. ....but also stuff like support exists; they aren't as dedicated in fixing your desktop as a server. Like one time SUPERMICRO fixed a firmware bug for me that was in something ancient and years out of support..they didn't want me to log in
[18:21:00] <peetaur> or anything, just gave me the fixed firmware.

[19:56:01] <No1x3r0> two_dogs, I figured as much yet I don't see any difference in results
[19:56:27] <pycurious> I currently load my private key in ssh-agent, then ssh to a machine, and do sudo -E -s to pass those keys to root to clone repos. If I do a "su username" as root, how do i make that private key passed to that user?
[19:56:33] <No1x3r0> two_dogs, how about blessing the startup device?
[19:56:39] <pycurious> also is this something i can do in .ssh/config?

[21:20:12] <fakuve> Sorry just a quickah , how do I find an occurrence in a directory full of text files (among other filetypes) , `cat ./* | grep <myPattern>`
[21:20:22] <fakuve> It looks like is not working
[21:20:26] <kurahaupo> jim: I remember receiving a card with my phone bill from Vodafone, when they first introduced SMS add a service. It really was quite distressing to find that they were actively encouraging people to use UR for both "your" and "you're" when I'd invested significant effort in keeping those two separated in my head.
[21:20:26] <kurahaupo> I felt very angry with them for many years, because until they published that card, "everyone knew" that "UR" stood for "you are" or "you're", but "your" would be abbreviated to "yr".
[21:20:40] <omegatron> "got physical punished" - where the heck happened that?
