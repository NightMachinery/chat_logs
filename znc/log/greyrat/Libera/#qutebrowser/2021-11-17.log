[01:52:36] <marcello42> hey :) ..Sometimes I have to press the ESC while I am in insert mode (for instance in a console) but when I press ESC I get out of the insert mode and the ESC keystroke is not sent to the browser window.. Any suggestion how to handle this?

[02:02:52] <bedlam> Press it twice?
[02:03:19] <MacGyver> marcello42: That's what passthrough-mode is for.
[02:03:26] <bedlam> There is a pass... ^^^
[02:03:44] <MacGyver> marcello42: Alternatively, rebind the insert-mode-exit to shift+esc, but that's probably the worse option.
[02:08:59] <marcello42> thanks
[02:09:59] <marcello42> for any reason passthrough mode is crtl+v here
[02:10:09] <MacGyver> Yeah, that's the default for passthrough mode.
[02:10:17] <MacGyver> Also to exit it's shift+esc.
[02:10:35] <marcello42> great thanks a lot

[02:17:50] <marcello42> speaking of I read that with current versions passing a flag to the webengine could prevent media (like youtube videos) from being played automatically.. how can I pass those flags? tried it to pass as an argument directly but it did not work
[02:18:00] <keir> 2.4.0  2021-10-21
[02:18:05] <keir> changed
[02:18:24] <keir> top level bullet #6
[02:19:40] <marcello42> ok thanks
[02:19:56] <keir> marcello42: https://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/settings.html#content.autoplay
[02:24:05] <marcello42> this is what I put in my config?
[02:24:24] <keir> marcello42: are you using config.py?
[02:24:31] <marcello42> yes
[02:24:35] <keir> then yes
[02:24:39] <marcello42> thanks
[02:24:41] <keir> set it to False

[02:25:48] <marcello42> get an error message trying to start quterowser now
[02:26:05] <marcello42> I put following line content.autoplay=False
[02:26:20] <marcello42> it says content is not defined
[02:26:39] <keir> that's because it's not
[02:26:52] <keir> you amend the `c` object
[02:26:59] <keir> so c.content.autoplay
[02:28:25] <marcello42> I see
[02:28:27] <keir> marcello42: https://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/configuring.html#_changing_settings
[02:28:41] <marcello42> anyway it is set but still plays the youtubevideos automatically
[02:29:01] <marcello42> I guess they do not have the corresponding tag
[02:29:18] <MacGyver> Works for me.
[02:29:23] <marcello42> hmmmm
[02:29:44] <MacGyver> But maybe my webengine or qutebrowser is out of date and it's a regression.
[02:30:06] <marcello42> perhaps
[02:30:07] <MacGyver> But my youtube-videos (actually all video content) require a click on a play button in the player.
[02:30:25] <marcello42> yes that is what I am looking for I prefer to start them in mpv actually
[02:30:51] <marcello42> I know I could open open mpv before actually clicking on the link but well 
[02:31:09] <MacGyver> That *is* what I would recommend for youtube anyway right now, yes.
[02:31:28] <MacGyver> Regardless, c.content.autoplay = False should work.
[02:32:15] <marcello42> funny thing
[02:32:33] <marcello42> now it works with the config.. but setting it in the browser via :set it does not
[02:32:42] <marcello42> thanks both of you I am happy now
[02:33:03] <MacGyver> Though I think it *doesn't* work if you click through to a next video in a tab where you've already activated the youtube player.
[02:33:20] <MacGyver> That will start playing automatically even with the setting.
[02:34:14] <keir> MacGyver: how do you usually start videos with mpv?
[02:34:56] <MacGyver> I've got ,m bound to "hint links spawn --verbose --detach umpv {hint-url}"
[02:35:03] <MacGyver> umpv is a script that mpv ships in contrib.
[02:35:35] <MacGyver> Which I've edited so that it also uses a browser-extracted cookie it passes to yt-dlp for watch-registration.
[02:35:50] <MacGyver> (Otherwise youtube suggestions are obviously useless, which you may or may not want them to be)
[02:36:01] <keir> i see, just wanted to make sure you weren't missing any tricks
[02:36:10] <keir> looks like you've all the tricks :-)
[02:36:19] <marcello42> but apprently I was :D
[02:36:52] <keir> you know, i just relised i meant to ping marcello42 with that question, not MacGyver 
[02:36:58] <MacGyver> Also ;m bound to "hint --rapid links spawn --verbose --detach umpv {hint-url}" and ,M to "spawn --verbose --detach umpv {url}"
[02:37:41] <keir> this what what i use
[02:37:43] <keir> config.bind(";w", "hint links spawn mpv '{hint-url}'")
[02:38:28] <MacGyver> The nice thing about umpv is that it just automatically queues in a single instance.
[02:38:30] <keir> to be fair, i should add --detach
[02:38:31] <marcello42> I only had the suggested ,m and ,M without umpv
[02:39:03] <marcello42> MacGyver: what did you add to the script?
[02:39:06] <keir> semicolon makes more sense as semicolon is used for most hint-based binds

[02:41:03] <MacGyver> marcello42: http://ix.io/3FcD , at the bottom under "else:"
[02:41:21] <MacGyver> I also tend to start umpv separately in a terminal somewhere as part of my desktop startup, so that it's already idling.
[02:41:51] <marcello42> where is this script located?
[02:42:05] <marcello42> in /bin ?
[02:43:34] <marcello42> looks like the script is only nesseacry if you have mpv idling right?
[02:44:18] <MacGyver> marcello42: It's usually nowhere, you put it in /usr/local/bin.
[02:44:38] <MacGyver> It's necessary if you want mpv to automatically create a playlist from subsequent youtube videos.
[02:44:53] <marcello42> aaaah
[02:45:00] <marcello42> now I got it
[02:45:09] <MacGyver> Otherwise qb will just start a new mpv instance for each video.
[02:45:44] <marcello42> no the only nessecary for me would be that the cookie is used hence youtube recognizes I watched the movie
[02:45:46] <keir> but how many videos are you watching simultaneously

[02:51:34] <marcello42> ;)
[02:51:47] <MacGyver> Counting what?
[02:51:51] <MacGyver> Oh.
[02:51:58] <MacGyver> keir: No the whole point is I just queue them up.
[02:52:06] <MacGyver> And then I can close youtube again.
[02:52:17] <keir> yeah, i realised that after i said it
[02:52:51] <keir> i like the idea of that
[02:53:06] <marcello42> so how did you handle the cookie thing
[02:53:29] <MacGyver> Iirc I logged into youtube on chromium and used a chromium-plugin to extract it.
[02:53:36] <MacGyver> Iirc yt-dlp also has better support for this.
[02:53:58] <MacGyver> It's been a few months.
[02:55:25] <marcello42> should also work for odysee I guess
[02:55:34] <MacGyver> --cookies-from-browser doesn't look like it supports qutebrowser on my version (yet).
[02:55:42] <marcello42> w/ yt-dlp you mean youtube downloader?
[02:56:05] <MacGyver> The specific fork of youtube downloader you want to use, specifically.
[02:56:23] <MacGyver> youtube-dl has (had) throttling issues for the past few weeks if not months.
[02:56:39] <keir> definitely months
[02:56:54] <MacGyver> And then set `script-opts=ytdl_hook-ytdl_path="yt-dlp"` in .config/mpv/mpv.conf
[02:57:03] <MacGyver> So that it actually uses yt-dlp instead of youtube-dl.
[02:57:40] <marcello42> wasn't aware of that I run the basic config atm 
[03:01:04] <marcello42> what does Iirc stand for?
[03:01:16] <MacGyver> If I recall correctly.
[03:01:27] <marcello42> nice :)
[03:01:43] <marcello42> so afaik is out 
[03:01:52] <MacGyver> No, I also use that.
[03:02:10] <MacGyver> They communicate different positions.
[03:02:37] <marcello42> fair enough
[03:02:47] <marcello42> never heared iirc though
[03:05:19] <MacGyver> It implies uncertainty about one's own position due to getting stuff from memory instead of checking.
[03:05:38] <MacGyver> AFAIK implies certainty with the caveat that it acknowledges information is missing due to never having encoutnered it.
[03:09:06] <marcello42> true
[03:09:17] <marcello42> you are absolute right on that
