[00:22:06] <ThePendulum> ... for once I actually pay for some videos, and they fucked the 16:9 it was recorded at into 4:3
[00:22:16] <ThePendulum> was that common for DVDs? it's not even cropped, it's stretched
[00:24:14] <sarnold> I hate that so much
[00:24:42] <sarnold> I can't begin to udnerstand why someone, anyone, would think people would want to watch stretched content
[00:27:06] <ThePendulum> idk if they were relying on the DVD player/TV to stretch to image back to 16:9 and that would somehow convey better quality than encoding it like that to begin with
[00:27:37] <sarnold> oh this is different than I thought
[00:27:48] <ThePendulum> thankfully that's easy enough to do in vlc and such, just wish they didn't make me have to contemplate whether I keep them in 480p, convert them with a loss, or download a 16:9 torrent anyway
[00:28:16] <ThePendulum> this is a widescreen recording squeezed into a 4:3 box, not the other way around
[00:28:30] <ThePendulum> so everything's a bit tall, lol

[01:40:05] <evilgohan2> It's annoying.
[01:40:35] <evilgohan2> we've gone from the days of when they would pan and scan 16:9 to 4:3 because people hated "black bars" to pan and scanning 4:3 to 16:9
[01:41:54] <rmmh> just stop pan and scanning shit, it's not hard

[17:50:23] <ThePendulum> joepie91: article in an electronics magazine from 1968 https://i.imgur.com/LEuca9D.png
[17:50:42] <ThePendulum> my dad asked his russian colleague what was written on the device
[17:50:51] <ThePendulum> "One April", lol
[17:51:06] <joepie91> hahaha what
[17:51:28] <ThePendulum> my dad checked the date on the cover of the magazine "oh."
[17:51:43] <joepie91> :')
[17:51:54] <ThePendulum> he was already suspicious about the last paragraph saying there were /hundreds/ of tiny multi-legged plastic thingies
[17:52:09] <ThePendulum> because in 1968, that would've been ridiculously advanced

[18:31:48] <ThePendulum> I threw out a bunch the other month heh
[18:32:23] <ThePendulum> joepie91: do you know someone that would be interested in like a decade worth of Quest magazines? 
[18:32:42] <rawktucc> whats quest
[18:33:01] <ThePendulum> a pop science magazine in the Netherlands 
[18:33:07] <rawktucc> ooo
[18:33:34] <ThePendulum> anyone else can claim them, but since they're in Dutch and in the Netherlands I figured I'd start with a dutch guy, lol
[18:34:50] <joepie91> ThePendulum: if you're throwing them out, I wouldn't mind taking them :p
[18:35:48] <ThePendulum> my interest in keeping them is slowly being overruled by my need for shelf space, although I might regret it down the line. It'd be nice if they end up with someone that could and would let me borrow one if I'm feeling nostalgic
[18:36:39] <ThePendulum> I'll ask my dad if he is attached to them since it's technically his subscription, but I don't think he is

[18:39:09] <ThePendulum> how much is your interest affected by completion? actually we've had a subscription literally since 2012 so a decade worth can't be too far off. I'm not sure if we lost any, I'm pretty sure we have a bunch from before we had a sub too

[19:05:42] <joepie91> ThePendulum: my main goal is pretty much to scan-and-store them
[19:06:26] <ThePendulum> as in scan the entire magazine or just index them?
[19:06:32] <joepie91> entire
[19:06:41] <joepie91> it's not as much work as it might sound like :p
[19:06:59] <ThePendulum> did you build that machine for it or was that someone else
[19:07:10] <joepie91> I assume you're thinking of the DIY book scanner
[19:07:12] <joepie91> not mine, nope
[19:07:15] <ThePendulum> that said I think with our subscription we actually have digital access to I think their entire catalog
[19:07:16] <joepie91> I just have an obscenely fast flatbed
[19:07:30] <joepie91> wait are there full digital copies?
[19:07:30] <ThePendulum> so I just don't want you to be doing redundant work
[19:07:38] <ThePendulum> I've never used it so I'll have to check
[19:09:10] <ThePendulum> oh
[19:09:11] <ThePendulum> "Niet alleen het nieuwste nummer, maar ook de eerder verschenen edities tot drie maanden terug"
[19:09:17] <rawktucc> what makes more sense: build a VM for archivebox, or use lxc/lxd
[19:09:36] <rawktucc> there's no way in fuck im installing x11 on my server, or compiling chromium from source
[19:10:14] <joepie91> ThePendulum: figured :p
[19:11:00] <ThePendulum> logging into that just in case, I guess they definitely didn't scan further back than when they started the service
[19:12:57] <ThePendulum> yeah it goes via tijdschrift.nl and I can only read the 4 latest editions, annoying

[19:15:26] <ThePendulum> one of them has an article about 3DEE which became a large part of my early teens because of it

[19:19:58] <ThePendulum> a few of them are already pretty knackered, so as long as it's not something like literally every page torn in half not too much
