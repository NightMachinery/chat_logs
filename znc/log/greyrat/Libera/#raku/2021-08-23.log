[04:25:55] <mjgardner> Mind if I offer a bit of ported Perl code for critique? Could this be written any better or using Raku features? https://gist.github.com/mjgardner/9edadb77708908a4aae0d12de44b458d

[04:35:50] <moon-child> a couple of things that you might not know about--I don't think they would improve the script, but as a point of style you might happen to prefer them--
[04:35:59] <moon-child> @feeds[0] can be written as @feeds.first or @feeds.head
[04:36:26] <moon-child> in  'put $_.title, "\t", $_.link',  you can leave off the $_
[04:36:51] <moon-child> or smoosh the whole thing into one string literal:  put "$_.title()\t$_.link()" for...
[04:37:13] <mjgardner> Oh right, you can interpolate method calls.
[04:41:16] <mjgardner> I think I‚Äôll do without the smooshing, it‚Äôs got more punctuation noise.
[04:42:07] <moon-child> yeah; I would probably prefer that if there were a lot of literal text alongside the interpolated bits, but not just for one character

[20:21:22] <Altreus> why is the second half always 0 though

[20:23:23] <codesections> Altreus yep, exactly
[20:23:45] <Altreus> okay, so how come the first one maintains state and the second one doesn't :x
[20:23:58] <Altreus> apologies if this is raku 101
[20:24:04] <Altreus> I feel like it's more likely to be 301 though
[20:24:12] <gfldex> i agree
[20:24:16] <andinus> second one is its own block {}
[20:24:22] <gfldex> But then, I'm a Raku beginner since 2008.
[20:24:31] <Altreus> :D
[20:24:37] <codesections> because $(‚Ä¶) *doesn't create a new scope ‚Äî which makes $(...) handy for things that want to access the outer scope
[20:24:50] <codesections> it's a context, not a block
[20:25:04] <codesections> (like @ or %)
[20:25:09] <Altreus> ooohh $() *is* the $ from the for block, but {} is a new block each iteration
[20:25:26] <Altreus> and that's where the state of $ is held
[20:25:36] <gfldex> m: for 0..5 { say ($($++) , {++$}.()) }
[20:25:36] <camelia> rakudo-moar 5c74b4053: OUTPUT: ¬´(0 1)‚ê§(1 1)‚ê§(2 1)‚ê§(3 1)‚ê§(4 1)‚ê§(5 1)‚ê§¬ª
[20:25:58] <Altreus> so $ is basically just "A container for this block to make use of"
[20:26:03] <codesections> yeah, exactly 
[20:26:16] <codesections> https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#The_$_variable
[20:26:16] <Altreus> nodnod
[20:26:24] <gfldex> m: for 0..5 { say ($($++); say {++$} }

[20:27:54] <gfldex> It's a little more complex in this case because the block is stored as a code object. And {} is the thing that created code objects, unless they are in sink context.
[20:27:55] <Altreus> oh no, I misunderstood slightly - "Each reference to $ within a lexical scope is in effect a separate variable"
[20:28:25] <Altreus> So you have as many of them as times you use them because Raku is somehow magic and can identify a variable by where it's used as well as what it's called
[20:28:58] <gfldex> Anonymous variables are special cased.
[20:29:10] <Altreus> special octarine case
[20:29:24] <Altreus> octiron?
[20:29:54] <Altreus> yes, octiron

[20:45:26] <Altreus> have to remember that in future
[20:46:33] <gfldex> And gist on lists wont return more then 100 elements. If I where to design assignments for Raku hires (one can dream!), I would make sure to have the fine candidate to output a list with 101 elements. :->

[20:51:31] <Altreus> I followed a twitter link from the daily and it segfaulted my browser tab
[20:52:17] <lizmat> Altreus interesting... which one ?
[20:52:41] <Altreus> this one, but I think it's generically Twitter sucking rather than the link in particular https://twitter.com/markjgardner/status/1427405084619587584
[20:52:59] <lizmat> yeah, looks like
[20:53:01] <Altreus> It might be due to the number of criminally bad takes on climate change that Twitter thinks I want to see
[20:53:19] <Altreus> Apparently a tweet involving the word "uninformed" means I want to see lots of other uninformed people with a platform
[20:53:33] <gfldex> If you must change the climate, please change it back!
[20:54:23] <gfldex> I had to get myself a cosy blanket, jut because we had the windows open.
[20:55:09] <Altreus> lizmat: you have far more patience on Twitter than I do
[20:55:50] <lizmat> perhaps..  :-)
