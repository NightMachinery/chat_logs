[03:31:33] <zilti[m]> How does csc -regenerate-import-libraries decide what to name a specific scm file's import.scm file?
[03:34:16] *** Quits: GD-IRC (~quassel@autistic.space) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[03:35:36] <zilti[m]> I am trying to port srfi-180, and it generates a "srfi-180.import.scm" from "srfi.180.scm" (and promptly fails afterwards because it expects an "srfi.180.scm"), but it correctly generates a "srfi.180.helpers.import.scm" from "srfi.180.helpers.scm"
[03:38:41] <siiky> that sounds weird... maybe it's leftover of a previous build? maybe before the file was srfi-180.scm instead of srfi.180.scm ?
[03:39:59] <siiky> I would personally delete those to make sure, and see if it happens again; if it does, maybe it's related to the egg file? idk
[03:40:15] <siiky> there's a neat program to delete the build artefacts, chicken-clean
[03:40:23] <zilti[m]> No, it's always been srfi.180.scm. I thought so too, so I deleted all the .link, .so, .o, and .import.scm files and ran chicken-install again, with the same result
[03:41:00] <s-liao> Sound like that https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-180/tree/master/srfi were wrote in R6RS.
[03:41:18] <siiky> idk then sorry... my best guess is the egg file
[03:41:24] <siiky> (have to reboot (again))

[03:41:56] <zilti[m]> s-liao: I forked from that and put it on https://gitea.lyrion.ch/zilti/srfi-180
[03:43:56] <s-liao> Okay.

[03:45:23] <zilti[m]> Apart from csc doing that weird thing it compiles fine as soon as I rename the import file. Didn't get to test it yet though.
[03:47:25] <siiky> zilti[m]: the first message I got was "Apart from csc (...)"; not sure if you said anything else to me in the meantime :p
[03:48:00] <siiky> but I don't think I can help you further, so good luck lol (and I gtg too)
[03:48:41] <zilti[m]> silky: I was replying to s-liao, I posted a link to the repo. Ok, thanks, and bye!
[03:55:43] <s-liao> import file is generated during building.
[04:00:38] <s-liao> It should be like what module have been having in the egg, functions of during compiling and exporting functions as well.
[04:02:50] *** Joins: Soni (~quassel@autistic.space)
[04:04:54] <s-liao> Like you have（module srfi-180), then export functions as well,  the srfi-180-import.scm file got generated.
[04:09:59] <zilti[m]> s-liao: Makes sense, and is what I thought. But I don't have (module srfi-180) anywhere unless I overlooked something
[04:11:18] <s-liao> zilti[m] looks like you have (define-library (srfi 180) such like this.
[04:12:20] <s-liao> This https://github.com/lassik/chicken-r7rs-example-egg example will help you a little bit.
[04:13:04] <zilti[m]> Yes, spaces translate to ., not to -, normally. See also srfi.180.helpers.scm and e.g. gitea.lyrion.ch/zilti/awful-sse
[04:14:16] <zilti[m]> In any case it is a bug. The very same tool first assumes srfi-180.import.scm and then, on the basis of the very same data, looks for srfi.180.import.scm
[04:21:45] <s-liao> yes.The module srfi-180, the generated file is srfi-180.import.scm. But syntax for export like (import (srfi 180) ) and (import (srfi-180)
[04:22:02] <s-liao>  (import srfi-180)
[04:24:20] <s-liao> But like (import (srfi 180) ) more natural. But in chicken sound like module srfi-180, the generated srfi-180.import.scm.
[04:26:22] <s-liao> But not sure that how it align the syntax (import (srfi 180) ) as well.
[04:27:31] <zilti[m]> So then tell me: why is (srfi 180) srfi-180, but (srfi 180 helpers) is srfi.180.helpers, and (awful sse) is awful.sse?
[04:35:34] <s-liao> The module name is like (module (awful sse)
[04:37:07] <s-liao> srfi-180 support (import (srfi 180) ), there is a patch for it or something.
[04:38:09] <s-liao> (srfi 180 helpers) is more like (import (only (srfi 180) helpers))
[04:49:34] <s-liao> I mean that (srfi 180 helpers) like import individual function, it does not work for the name of the generated file.

[05:19:27] <jcroisant> zilti[m]: CHICKEN treats (srfi <number>) as a special case, translating it to srfi-<number>. For backwards compatibility, probably.
[05:23:32] <jcroisant> So as odd as it seems, you probably want to define modules srfi-180 and srfi.180.helpers
