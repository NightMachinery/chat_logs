[01:22:51] <hoistbypetard> manicennui: i do too (not in a "blu ray" specific sense, but in a "how much longer can we get the things we want to watch on a physical medium" sense) and it makes me a little unhappy that this is likely to end soon.
[01:26:16] <manicennui> Fortunately there is enough stuff that I want to see to last several lifetimes.
[01:26:26] <manicennui> So if I every go full neo-luddite, I'll just watch old movies.
[01:26:33] <manicennui> ever
[01:26:51] <manicennui> Kind of want to buy some land in Vermont or something and become a hermit.
[01:27:15] <manicennui> Seems like vinyl will be around for a while
[01:27:30] <hoistbypetard> i'm probably in the same boat. and maybe have enough to last one expected lifetime unwatched on my shelf. certainly have enough (that i want to rewatch + that i haven't yet watched) on my shelf.
[01:28:39] <hoistbypetard> oddly, given how i feel, i don't have a turntable connected to anything and don't much like the "superior" vinyl sound
[01:29:44] <hoistbypetard> i graduated high school in the mid 90s, so my collection was only organically ever tape/cd. the only vinyl i have is stuff i inherited and wouldn't throw away.

[01:33:57] <manicennui> I'm not big into vinyl, but it seems to be more common than anything now.
[01:34:25] <manicennui> It's trendy
[01:34:33] <manicennui> Big labels still release CDs
[01:35:34] <hoistbypetard> The music disturbs me less anyway. I get DRM free digital versions of all the music I care about anyway. And I can keep that stuff backed up :)

[01:43:30] <manicennui> I also like not having to rely on an Internet connection to listen to music and watch movies
[01:43:43] <manicennui> I guess local files works
[01:43:49] <manicennui> But it would be nice to have no computers involved
[01:44:38] <manicennui> There are some companies doing really cool vinyl.
[01:44:41] <manicennui> I bought this: https://waxworkrecords.com/products/color-out-of-space
[01:44:41] <buttsbot> -   Color Out Of Space -  - – Waxwork Records -  -
[01:45:34] <hoistbypetard> that looks really cool
[01:46:11] <manicennui> I still appreciate the cover/insert/label art that CDs and vinyl have.
[01:46:24] <manicennui> They mostly gave up on that stuff for movies though.

[01:46:45] <manicennui> They use the crappiest cases possible now.
[01:47:03] <hoistbypetard> me too. i'd say it never developed for movies, other than special box sets, though.
[01:47:29] <hoistbypetard> dvds rarely had it IME, and blu-rays might as well come in blank envelopes
[01:48:35] <hoistbypetard> (VHS was less interesting than DVD that way by my memory, but that was probably a less comprehensive survey of the industry just given my age.)
[01:52:30] *** Quits: leon_ (~znc@user/leon) (Quit: see you later, alligator)
[01:54:01] <manicennui> I guess it was more that there were always tons of special editions of movies.
[01:54:08] <manicennui> Now it has to be something really popular
[01:54:44] <manicennui> Can't even count on getting most things on 4k
[01:55:20] <hoistbypetard> is that mostly down to limitations in the source material?
[02:00:07] <manicennui> I meant for new things.
[02:00:12] <manicennui> For old things I get it.
[02:01:14] <manicennui> I think for new things it is considered some kind of premium thing they can charge more for, but they won't release in 4k unless it is popular enough.
[02:01:26] <manicennui> I just want 4k to have the highest quality copy in case they stop making it.
[02:01:42] <manicennui> For instance I bought Pig on blu ray and it is 1080p.
[02:02:26] <manicennui> 4k should be the default
[02:02:57] <manicennui> Candyman on the other hand has both.
[02:03:15] <manicennui> So does Suicide Squad.
[02:03:46] <manicennui> Surprisingly Green Knight is available in 4k.
[02:03:57] <manicennui> I guess I don't get it.
[02:05:18] <hoistbypetard> i don't either but agree that 4k should be the default.
[02:05:47] <hoistbypetard> since it's not, having things that do upscaling well on hand remains worthwhile

[03:26:43] <jjuran> I recently had to log into Google to check an account setting, which means I had to enable scripting for a couple google domains, and having disabled them again I get a blank page for search results.
[03:27:26] <jjuran> If I enable just google.com I get results, but the presentation is different than what I'm used to.
[03:27:45] <jjuran> manicennui: It = software
[03:29:33] <manicennui> Didn't know whether we were despairing over a particular aspect of software.
[03:30:08] <manicennui> They've been rewriting our frontend in vue at work. They have spent a fuckton of time trying to get it to do what the existing frontend did.
[03:30:23] <manicennui> I told my boss that the same people will want to rewrite it again in a couple years when vue is no longer cool.
[03:30:40] <manicennui> We have gained absolutely nothing from the rewrite other than new bugs.
[03:31:20] <imode> pop culture engineering is so wasteful.

[04:55:12] <imode> another vomit-inducing JS thing.
[04:55:41] <prussian> Ya. Because bucklescript didn't work, so they tried slapping some new syntax on it and I guess that wasn't cool enough.

[04:58:28] <prussian> hoistbypetard: what's with the _
[04:58:43] <prussian> Is it because hyperscript was already a thing?

[05:17:15] <hoistbypetard> hypercard was a weird and cool thing. writing a hypercard stack, scripted in hypertalk, with two XCMDs written in C (one for reading the status of an industrial printer that printed clothing labels and one for dialing pagers when that went wrong) and seeing it installed in the factory that ran that printer made me think differently about what i could make computers do

[08:47:30] <manicennui> My employer allows it for most engineering positions, but you have to "apply"
[08:47:36] <manicennui> I haven't heard whether anyone has been denied.
[08:47:36] <imode> that's the only reason I didn't jump at it, gwozniak.

[16:38:45] <prussian> I'm applying to these god awful devops jobs and I can't shake this feeling that devops should be renamed.
[16:38:59] <prussian> to like... DevOops or DevOopsieWhoopsie uwu
[16:41:49] <dminkovsky> never understood the name
[16:42:09] <dminkovsky> people snarked all around me that it was a genius name and anyone who doesn't get it is a dumbass
[16:42:48] <dminkovsky> i guess i am a dumbass :(
[16:42:51] <dminkovsky> devops, what is it
[16:43:02] <dminkovsky> is it.... ops?
[16:43:16] <prussian> idk
[16:43:31] <prussian> I just assume ops = oops
[16:43:43] <prussian> since it seems like a rolling battle of unfucking something broken
[16:43:47] <prussian> or breaking things
[16:43:49] <prussian> all the time
[16:43:59] <dminkovsky> yeah, ops lol
[16:44:06] <dminkovsky> why the "Dev"?
[16:44:13] <Brekkjern> DevOps just means that the team responsible for coding the crap is also responsible for running and maintaining it.
[16:44:27] <dminkovsky> Brekkjern: isn't that... ops?
[16:44:34] <Brekkjern> Yes, but done by the devs.
[16:44:50] <dminkovsky> see in my experience, these people were sysadmins
[16:45:09] <Brekkjern> Point is that traditional setup was a team of devs writing code, and handing it to a team of ops who installed and ran it.
[16:45:24] <dminkovsky> and now?
[16:45:33] <Brekkjern> With DevOps there should theoretically not be a barrier between those two teams.
[16:45:44] <dminkovsky> yes i don't understand
[16:45:54] <dminkovsky> they're still two different teams
[16:46:02] <Brekkjern> Then you are not doing DevOps
[16:46:08] <prussian> confusing.
[16:46:10] <dminkovsky> definitely not, n
[16:46:11] <dminkovsky> no
[16:46:14] <dminkovsky> lol
[16:46:19] <prussian> ok, so what's an SRE
[16:46:24] <Brekkjern> Beats me
[16:46:24] <prussian> that one is more confusing to me
[16:46:26] <prussian> lmao
[16:46:28] <dminkovsky> i'm just running k8s and --replicas=N
[16:46:34] <prussian> I don't even want to do "ops" or whatever.
[16:46:35] <dminkovsky> prussian: lol you went there
[16:46:44] <dminkovsky> you crazy
[16:46:55] <prussian> Literally all my resume experiences are "DevOps" and I hate it.
[16:47:17] <Brekkjern> It's a methodology too though
[16:47:29] <Brekkjern> CI/CD stuff and so on
[16:47:53] <Brekkjern> Just piling more work on one person isn't doing DevOps.
[16:48:11] <prussian> ...or is it?
[16:48:25] <dminkovsky> Brekkjern: if they're still two different teams
[16:48:30] <dminkovsky> and one team is devs
[16:48:32] <dminkovsky> and the other team is ops
[16:48:35] <dminkovsky> wtf is dev ops
[16:48:37] <Geekingfrog> Remind me of https://blog.dijit.sh/devops-confusion-and-frustration
[16:48:44] <dminkovsky> it's total bullshit
[16:48:46] <dminkovsky> they're just ops
[16:48:47] <Brekkjern> dminkovsky: That would not be devops.
[16:48:56] <prussian> I'm telling you, it's just DevOops
[16:49:03] <prussian> I'm going with that.
[16:49:08] <Brekkjern> I honestly don't understand what is difficult with the concept?
[16:49:13] <dminkovsky> < Brekkjern> With DevOps there should theoretically not be a barrier between those two teams.
[16:49:19] <dminkovsky> ^ two teams
[16:49:22] <Brekkjern> Ah
[16:49:23] <dminkovsky> no barried
[16:49:27] <dminkovsky> who said there was a barrier in the first place
[16:49:28] <Brekkjern> I mean that they are merged into one
[16:49:34] <dminkovsky> i see
[16:49:35] <prussian> well, the barrier is me not responding to teams.
[16:49:35] <prussian> lmao
[16:49:37] <dminkovsky> how does that make sense
[16:49:42] <prussian> or emails
[16:49:55] <Brekkjern> You have a team that is responsible for a product. From one end to another.
[16:50:01] <dminkovsky> merging them into one team doesnt make the ops devs or the devs ops
[16:50:01] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[16:50:08] <Brekkjern> Indeed
[16:50:08] <dminkovsky> what changed?
[16:50:09] <prussian> ^ love this meme
[16:50:30] <dminkovsky> open office less money spent on leasing?
[16:50:33] <Brekkjern> dminkovsky: Nothing changed. Management just doesn't want to invest in modern systems.
[16:50:51] <dminkovsky> whatever fml
[16:50:59] <dminkovsky> thanks for indulging me
[16:51:01] <Brekkjern> There is a difference between what DevOps is and how it is practiced in the industry.
[16:51:14] <prussian> true
[16:51:16] <dminkovsky> that could be the source of my confusion since i never worked in industry
[16:51:17] <prussian> just like agile
[16:51:20] <Geekingfrog> I think there's also the siren song of having fully intercheangable minions, who can work on anything as the business requires it
[16:51:21] <Brekkjern> What management often call DevOps is absolutely not what the theory calls DevOps
[16:51:34] <dminkovsky> Geekingfrog: but no joke, isn't *that* RSE?
[16:51:37] <dminkovsky> erm, SRE
[16:51:51] <prussian> I was afraid there was yet another new word.
[16:51:52] <prussian> lma
[16:51:54] <Geekingfrog> I believe SRE are closer to the traditional ops ppl.
[16:51:55] <Brekkjern> In my mind SRE is just a fancy term for cloud ops...
[16:52:07] <dminkovsky> SREs i thought were ops who coul dcode
[16:52:17] <dminkovsky> aka full stack developers
[16:52:25] <prussian> I'm... so confused.
[16:52:40] <Geekingfrog> nah, all the SRE i've interacted with do very little product/app development
[16:53:43] <dminkovsky> yeah but i thought the schtick was that they could "jump in" to the app if need be
[16:53:47] <dminkovsky> to deal with problems
[16:53:56] <Geekingfrog> But I think there's little in the way of standardised terminology. For me, SRE ~ ops, and devops = devs who are also supposed to know (use and fix) the infra
[16:53:56] <dminkovsky> or to optimize
[16:54:10] <Geekingfrog> uhm, if that's the case I never saw that
[16:55:07] <dminkovsky> gotcha
[16:55:15] <dminkovsky> thank you
[16:55:23] <Brekkjern> Traditionally your app would be somewhat of a monolith, often only requiring a database to support it and maybe a webserver. Modern deployments oftend depend on several other apps like Kafka, MQTT, memcache, an ELK stack for logs, Elastic for searches, etc...
[16:55:44] <Brekkjern> It makes sense that the devs focus on the app itself, and SREs focus on the supporting apps around it.
[16:58:50] <dminkovsky> sure
[16:59:06] <dminkovsky> i'm not express frustration with the term "devops"
[16:59:28] <dminkovsky> why have the term SRE or DevOps when you can just have sysadmins or operators
[17:00:08] <Brekkjern> Cause all terms are loaded and if you can say you are a developer, then it means you can say "that isn't the job of a developer. Have someone else do it" and they don't have to understand it
[17:00:44] <Brekkjern> The number of devs I have talked to who don't understand how IP or DNS even works is staggering. If you do DevOps then you cannot just say "that's not my job"
[17:02:33] <Brekkjern> And the number of times I've had to explain how PKI works is also dumb as shit...
[17:02:36] <Geekingfrog> I think that's the idea yes. So that you don't need to manage two different team's priority to align. You have the same group of people who should be able to plow through every obstacle
[17:03:11] <Geekingfrog> But ofc, as was noted before, devs suddenly don't get all this knowledge because they got renamed into devops
[17:03:12] <Brekkjern> Yes, and their only real priority is the one app/product rather than spreading their focus across several
[17:03:23] <Geekingfrog> exactly
[17:03:57] <dminkovsky> s/i'm not/i'm just/
[17:04:31] <dminkovsky> "devs I have talked to who don't understand how IP or DNS even works is staggering." <- "devs"
[17:04:41] <dminkovsky> that's life i guess
[17:04:52] <dminkovsky> i mean, you can't know everything
[17:05:01] <Brekkjern> Sure
[17:05:11] <Brekkjern> But they work with stuff directly impacted by that
[17:05:52] <Brekkjern> I'm not expecting everyone to know everything, but holy shit they should know the difference from a domain, TLD and an URL
[17:06:39] <dminkovsky> yes.
[17:06:57] <dminkovsky> i once worked with a person who said they didn't know javascript because they knew ruby
[17:07:04] <Brekkjern> Hah
[17:07:05] <dminkovsky> and this person was, i shit you not, a "web developer"
[17:07:35] <Brekkjern> Well... They did Rails I guess?
[17:07:36] <Geekingfrog> tbh, full stack devs are kind of insane. There are *so many* things to know.
[17:07:43] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[17:08:25] <Geekingfrog> It's bonkers to think someone with 3 years of experience can have good knowledge from front-end and browser, to mobile app, to backend, to network, to databases
[17:08:40] <dminkovsky> Brekkjern: yes, but their title was "web developer"
[17:08:52] <Brekkjern> dminkovsky: I'm not defending them...
[17:08:59] <dminkovsky> it takes a lot longer than 3 years that's for sure
[17:09:45] <dminkovsky> i definitely don't want to make it seem like i'm shitting on division of labor
[17:10:19] <dminkovsky> i think i'm a really solid full stack dev but it's taken me 7-10 years of doing one and one thing only with my life. that's bad.
[17:10:36] <dminkovsky> not a good way to live or make a product
[17:10:45] <Brekkjern> I don't feel solid in any field other than maybe Python as a language?
[17:11:23] *** Joins: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz)
[17:11:27] <dminkovsky> probably just cause you haven't spent much time in any other lang?
[17:11:45] <Brekkjern> I wasn't thinking about languages really
[17:12:02] <Brekkjern> More databases and the internals of DNS for example
[17:12:56] <Brekkjern> I know a little bit about a lot of things
[17:13:08] <Brekkjern> There are few things I know all that well
[17:13:20] <Brekkjern> All I do is "fake it till you make it" and it's exhausting as hell
[17:14:01] <dminkovsky> yeah i mean the thing is you can't really fake it in programming
[17:14:05] <Brekkjern> I know other people do that as well, but the expectations that are leveled at me makes it hard
[17:14:26] <Brekkjern> It's generally not the programming stuff that is the difficult part IMO
[17:14:54] <Brekkjern> The only part about programming I have an issue with is interacting with databases since I've never really done it.
[17:15:12] <Brekkjern> Or rather... I've done it, but I have no idea what I did other than make it work.
[17:16:47] <Geekingfrog> tbh, most of the time it's enough
[17:17:00] <Brekkjern> Absolutely
[17:18:10] <Brekkjern> But I also get asked to deal with DR, redundancy, load balancing, security, networking, virtualization, containerization, k8s, dns, PKI, etc...
[17:18:22] <Brekkjern> Add on Windows and Linux servers to that...
[17:22:25] <Brekkjern> Luckily nobody expects me to know all the languages too :P

[17:46:17] <gwozniak> re earlier devops discussion: what I hate about this "devops" approach is that now I'm debugging DNS in order to run tests, thanks to Docker containers, when I'm already debugging a bunch of other things

[17:50:43] <prussian> lol
[17:50:56] <prussian> You'll be flagged by the NSA for that.
[17:51:01] <gwozniak> prussian: the dream of everyone on the team being "interchangable" to any tech being used by said team is such a "manager utopia" idea that I can't even
[17:51:13] <prussian> ya...
[17:51:16] <prussian> idk
[17:52:52] <gwozniak> I'm giving a talk later this week about debugging the compiler and I think my audience is under the impression that a "debugger" means something that must be gdb and only on the command line
[17:53:07] <prussian> uh oh.
[17:53:12] <gwozniak> I mean, if anything is holding us back, it's this perception
[17:53:36] <prussian> I think a lot of people feel like it could be better, but no one wants to do it.
[17:53:40] <gwozniak> I'm no genius, but I can debug stuff much faster than my coworkers because I used decent tools
[17:53:47] <prussian> or maybe it's some weird like cargo cult thing
[17:53:48] <prussian> idk
[17:53:53] <gwozniak> idk either
[17:54:04] <prussian> I just use GDB because it's the best I go.
[17:54:07] <prussian> got.
[17:54:13] <prussian> but I usually spruce it up.
[17:54:21] <gwozniak> I use it because it's the best for debugging gcc
[17:54:29] <gwozniak> And yeah, I totally spruce it up
[17:54:43] <gwozniak> Because using "list" to see the source is just masochism
[17:54:53] <prussian> speaking of which. I need to debug why gdb hates this code at work so much it segfaults.
[17:55:10] <prussian> ya. it is. lmao
[17:55:25] <gwozniak> I hit a disturbing number of gdb crashes
[17:55:34] <prussian> ok, so i'm not the only one.
[17:55:52] <prussian> I can't tell if the code is just really broken or gdb is just really broken.
[17:56:02] <prussian> probably both.
[17:56:16] <prussian> meh. soon I will be helicoptered out into the world of "kubernetes" or whatever that is.
[17:56:29] <gwozniak> best of luck with that
[17:56:29] <prussian> or maybe I'll work at M$ and have Visual Studio or something.
[17:56:49] <prussian> a...
[17:56:50] <prussian> ya...
[17:57:05] <gwozniak> The gdb crashes I hit are when I "run" again
[17:57:09] <prussian> I don't know anything about k8s other than it has kubes and yaml programming or something.
[17:57:37] <prussian> I can't even tell what throws mine off. GDB just can't figure out what's going on and I can only do asm step.
[17:57:56] <prussian> stepi
[17:58:03] <gwozniak> And those crashes are inconsistent, of course
[17:58:09] <prussian> yes
[17:58:27] <prussian> and sometimes I can just hit next and then all of a sudden it finds where it is.
[17:58:38] <prussian> just very broken shit.
[17:58:39] <prussian> idk
[17:58:46] <prussian> I'm too lazy to really dig
[17:58:47] <gwozniak> I use stepi (or equivalent) when debugging on device. I rarely use it debugging the compiler itself
[17:59:06] <prussian> makes sense.
[17:59:36] <gwozniak> I had to debug the IDE once to figure out why setting a breakpoint didn't work
[17:59:48] <prussian> that sounds awful.

[18:46:41] <imode> in fact I'd say that's the cherry on top of the shit sundae.
[18:46:56] <manicennui> I assume your reasons have to do with things that have been "shit" for years.
[18:47:04] <manicennui> Meanwhile they are growing like 30% per year.
[18:47:11] <imode> growth is cancerous.
[18:47:15] <manicennui> Sure.
[18:47:16] <imode> nothing to be celebrated.
[18:47:21] <manicennui> But it is also what public companies exist for.
[18:47:27] <manicennui> Not celebrating it.
[18:47:33] <imode> you're not, others are.
[18:47:42] <imode> the tumor is getting bigger. celebrate.
[18:47:42] <riv> i like some of the content on youtube, but they changed the incentives in a really weird way
[18:47:47] <manicennui> But it is the measure of someone leading part of a public company.
[18:47:53] <riv> so the way creators use youtube is completely different than it used to be
[18:47:59] <manicennui> I enjoy YT quite a bit.
[18:48:05] <imode> you can be a public company without being a shithole.
[18:48:11] <manicennui> imode: Prove it.
[18:48:19] <manicennui> =P
[18:48:20] <riv> i feel like youtube shouldn't pay people to make videos
[18:48:30] <manicennui> riv: Why would they post them?
[18:48:31] <riv> idk
[18:48:34] <imode> let's see, what public companies do I know that aren't shitholes.
[18:48:35] <manicennui> Or do you mean their original content?
[18:48:48] <riv> manicennui: well people post videos just as a hobby or whatever
[18:49:11] <riv> but then we might get even more in-video adverts...
[18:49:12] <manicennui> riv: Sure, but a lot of the really great people try to go full-time.

[18:50:50] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[18:50:52] <manicennui> Things would probably change if their revenue started slipping.
[18:51:06] <drakonis> Xe: nope
[18:51:13] <imode> my point is that "growth hacking" is a relatively new phenomenon.
[18:51:26] <manicennui> I don't know.
[18:51:54] <imode> public companies have existed in the past and I have a hard time believing that every one of them indulged in that kind of cancerous growth.
[18:52:02] <imode> but maybe they did, I'd need to dredge up history.
[18:52:02] <manicennui> imode: YT has actual revenue and one assumes profit though.
[18:52:06] <gwozniak> I think it became more of a thing in the 70s when shareholder value took over
[18:52:27] <drakonis> Xe: there's a mechanism for avoiding that
[18:52:34] <manicennui> imode: Are you aware of what people like Carnegie did?
[18:52:43] <manicennui> And the other rich families whose names you see on buildings.
[18:52:52] <manicennui> Assholes have always existed.
[18:53:15] <imode> that's correct. and yet I have a hard time believing that every leader of a public company is an asshole.
[18:53:42] <Geekingfrog> have you read "the dictator's handbook" ?
[18:53:58] <imode> have not.
[18:54:01] <manicennui> imode: Perhaps not, but being a public company encourages that behavior.
[18:54:07] <imode> manicennui: in this day and age.. yeah.
[18:54:09] <manicennui> Not that private companies are all great.
[18:54:24] <imode> they at least have a removed obligation to maximize shareholder value.
[18:54:31] <Geekingfrog> I found it quite interesting. It's an explanation of the structures around position of power, and the incentives/laws to stay in place, which almost always encourage bad behaviours
[18:54:55] <manicennui> I'm not going to lie, I'd be willing to do bad things for a lot of money.
[18:55:09] <manicennui> Just not willing to do them for a small amount of additional money.
[18:55:12] <Geekingfrog> same
[18:55:16] <imode> I'm not.
[18:55:17] <manicennui> And not to make someone else money.
[18:55:23] <imode> and I'm very comfortable in that fact.
[18:55:30] <manicennui> I wouldn't like kill people or anything.
[18:55:36] <imode> define bad, then.
[18:55:52] <manicennui> Create an algorithm that shows people the shitty videos they want to see.
[18:56:03] <manicennui> =P
[18:56:08] <Xe> drakonis: what is it?
[18:56:24] <imode> how long have you been using youtube, manicennui.
[18:56:25] <drakonis> grafts
[18:56:31] <manicennui> imode: Since it first existed.
[18:56:40] <imode> same. how much do you recall from those early days.
[18:56:53] <manicennui> I remember it not being anywhere near as useful a decade ago.
[18:56:54] <drakonis> basically you can replace a package with another
[18:57:08] <manicennui> Now I watch a lot of really amazing amateur content.
[18:57:22] <imode> that's funny, I remember it being quite useful, as those amateurs existed long before growth hacking took place.
[18:57:37] <drakonis> all packages that depend on it will be redirected to the new one
[18:58:04] <imode> I remember when related videos actually used to be useful.
[18:58:07] <drakonis> there's a blog post on it
[18:58:19] <imode> instead of just leading you through the same tunnels to circle you around the content you're already watching.
[18:58:34] <imode> and then offering up that fake-ass "Explore" page which is just trending but relabeled.
[18:59:01] <manicennui> imode: Do you use it logged in?
[18:59:04] <imode> there has been a noticable decline in quality that I'm sure the nearest blog post can summarize in 10 paragraphs.
[18:59:13] <imode> yeah, I've had my youtube account since it was a site.

[19:00:48] <imode> wonder where she's at.
[19:00:49] <manicennui> Rural Washington is amazing.
[19:01:07] <manicennui> imode: In the NW part of the state I believe.
[19:01:23] <manicennui> NE of Seattle.
[19:01:23] <imode> I'm in the SW part.
[19:01:36] <imode> welllll.. like central west, by everett.
[19:01:59] <manicennui> The views in some of her videos are amazing.
[19:02:06] <manicennui> I thought she was in the Alps or something at first.
[19:02:23] <imode> I'll reserve my actual judgement for when I watch a video but they seem like the typical crap you'd find on influencers' feeds.

[19:02:57] <manicennui> I'm a sucker for people in nature doing simple things.

[19:03:49] <imode> I could probably say a lot of bad things about everyone.
[19:04:24] <manicennui> Yeah, but you'd be attacked by the SerpaSquad.
[19:04:41] <imode> and I assume that group of people exists due to growth hacking mechanisms that are employed by everyone with a brand to sell.

[19:06:41] <imode> manicennui: is that some org?
[19:06:49] <imode> like noaa or something.
[19:07:02] <manicennui> "The Ocean Exploration Trust was founded in 2008 by Titanic discoverer Dr. Robert Ballard to explore the ocean"
[19:07:03] <manicennui> Yes
[19:07:17] <imode> mm.
[19:07:24] <manicennui> They've been sponsored by NOAA.
[19:07:30] <imode> hope they don't harm anything while they're down there.
[19:08:02] <manicennui> I learned yesterday that there is some rover on the bottom of the ocean that is going to stay down there for 5 years.
[19:08:04] <manicennui> Different org.
[19:08:19] <imode> cool, how's that going to affect the things it comes across.
[19:08:49] <companion_cube> a single rover? probably not too much
[19:09:12] <imode> yeah. but these surveys are typically done for exploratory purposes that aren't just about gathering knowledge.
[19:09:16] <imode> usually oil and gas.
[19:09:22] <imode> so, enjoy your exploration.
[19:09:25] <manicennui> I assume it is designed to kill anything it comes across.
[19:09:29] <imode> it'll probably be gone in a few years.
[19:09:41] <manicennui> imode: The one I read about was for scientific purposes.

[20:45:17] <ngoldbaum> before my time using python
[20:45:30] <ngoldbaum> the early python 2 versions are Very Bad
[20:45:55] <ngoldbaum> python 2.7 was peak python fuck dealing with non-ascii text
[20:46:53] <drakonis> people got so mad when python 3 changed that
[20:49:27] <Brekkjern> >panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [5121:1401]
[20:49:28] <Brekkjern> No shit...
[20:49:43] <imode> DAMN.
[20:49:48] <Brekkjern> Bigger question is what the fuck made it think that those two numbers make any sort of sense?
[20:51:23] <ngoldbaum> lol the curse of in-band json comment fields
[20:53:31] <Church> Man going though old SA threads... ah memories
[20:53:34] <Church> Not all of them good
[20:53:56] <Brekkjern> Whelp. I found out why the bot fucked up on that link
[20:54:27] <imode> do tell.
[20:55:11] <companion_cube> Church: surely there must be one from servo?
[20:55:12] <Brekkjern> This is the title declaration from that page:
[20:55:12] <Brekkjern> <title data-react-helmet="true">Configuring Jest · Jest</title>
[20:55:12] <Brekkjern> And the bot looks for the string "<title>" and "</title">
[20:55:43] <Brekkjern> So it found the </title> part, and then lower into the document there is another <title>.
[20:55:59] <imode> HTML sucks.
[20:55:59] <Brekkjern> So that kinda makes sense...
[20:56:09] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:56:18] <Brekkjern> I should probably use a parser for this instead of yoloing it :P
[20:56:22] <Church> companion_cube: Not maintained anymore I think?
[20:56:26] <jlindgren> surely the regex just needs tweaked :|
[20:56:32] <Church> Or if it was I wasn't easily grokking it
[20:56:34] <jlindgren> * :P
[20:56:34] <Brekkjern> lolregex?
[20:56:42] <Brekkjern> titleStartIndex := strings.Index(s, "<title>")
[20:56:55] <ngoldbaum> everyone knows you can parse html with a sufficiently advanced regex
[20:56:55] <jlindgren> YES lol
[20:57:05] <Brekkjern> Wow! Such expression. Many regular.
[20:57:17] <riv> titleStartIndex := strings.Index(s, "<title")
[20:57:19] <riv> fixed
[20:57:22] <imode> is HTML's grammar _actually_ regular.
[20:57:29] <Brekkjern> riv: That's even worse :P
[20:57:31] <companion_cube> Church: no idea
[20:57:32] <jlindgren> i dont think so
[20:57:36] <imode> I don't think so either.
[20:57:53] <imode> brings to question: what's the computational power required to recognize an HTML document.
[20:57:54] <Brekkjern> riv: If I did that then the title would have become this: data-react-helmet="true">Configuring Jest · Jest
[20:58:01] <companion_cube> with perl regex you can do anything!*
[20:58:06] <riv> jump past the >

[20:58:27] <ngoldbaum> from back in the day when you could make jokes on stackoverflow
[20:58:30] <Brekkjern> riv: Or I could just use an HTML parser and look for the first title tag through that :P
[20:58:31] <jlindgren> you beat me to it ngoldbaum
[20:59:11] <riv> hmm
[20:59:12] <imode> "HTML is not a regular language".
[20:59:15] <riv> i misremembered that question
[20:59:17] <imode> fuckin prove it m8.
[20:59:24] <riv> I thought it was about parsing a matching open and close
[20:59:28] <riv> but it's actually just about matching an open
[20:59:40] <jlindgren> there is an answer here thats interesting: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1758162
[20:59:41] <buttsbot> html - RegEx match open tags except XHTML self-contained tags - Stack Overflow
[20:59:45] <riv> I know that you can't match e.g. balanced brackets with regex
[21:00:30] <imode> not with that attitude.
[21:00:31] <riv> jlindgren: I saw that answer but - based on the link to type 2 grammer - I think it's thinking the question wants to parse matching open/close tags
[21:00:41] <riv> really the question is about lexing, not parsing
[21:00:47] <jlindgren> true
[21:01:42] <riv> many of the answers misunderstand the question actually
[21:02:22] <Brekkjern> dminkovsky: So should we rename buttsbot to жопабот?
[21:02:45] <riv> https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-lex/sgml.l apparently this does it
[21:02:59] <riv> this is incredibly unenlightening
[21:03:59] <jlindgren> TIL that XML is a subset of SGML, and HTML is SGML
[21:04:15] <riv> it's such a pest that HTML and XML are distinct
[21:04:21] <jlindgren> ^^ i hate it so much
[21:04:23] <riv> why complicate things like that..
[21:04:33] <manicennui> riv: There was an attempt to make HTML valid XML.
[21:04:48] <jlindgren> honestly i love xml - having an xsd to validate docs with is just *chefs kiss*. but its a PITA to write and look at.
[21:04:59] <jlindgren> manicennui: is that what XHTML is?
[21:05:06] <riv> yes schemas are great
[21:05:24] <manicennui> jlindgren: I believe so. It was a specific version of HTML 4.
[21:05:41] <manicennui> Everyone gave up on it.

[21:06:52] <jlindgren> lol apparently this can validate html + xml of a bunch of flavors
[21:07:42] <manicennui> Apparently HTML 4.01 Strict was similar to but not exactly the same as XHTML 1.0.
[21:07:53] <manicennui> Regardless, no one cares about it anymore.
[21:09:17] <imode> fuck document stores.
[21:09:23] <riv> :O
[21:09:31] <imode> and fuck documents.
[21:09:37] <imode> insufferable things.
[21:09:52] <manicennui> Screw computers.
[21:10:20] <manicennui> Nothing good comes from them.

[21:12:39] <manicennui> Musk
[21:12:58] <imode> fuck elon.
[21:13:03] <manicennui> I wonder whether anyone in his cult is confused about who to support.

[21:13:29] <buttsbot> BillyJackO comments on Who does the actual work of making the cars Tesla profits from?
[21:13:42] <manicennui> "I was on the Elon bandwagon until I learned about his staunch anti union stance and the compensation line workers get at his factories."
[21:14:38] <imode> "I was a fan of the billionaires until I learned how they became billionaires."
[21:15:33] <indigo> Never meet your heroes
[21:15:42] <imode> who tf has a billionaire as a hero.
[21:15:49] <drakonis> assholes
[21:15:55] <imode> those who lead a sad existence.
[21:23:25] <manicennui> I never understood why people liked Tony Stark in the MCU.
[21:23:34] <manicennui> He is basically the same kind of asshole.
[21:24:51] <imode> I think his character arc is that he's a reformed asshole.
[21:25:18] <edm> i remember someone weeping behind me in the cinema when he died
[21:25:30] <edm> i really couldn't understand
[21:25:33] <imode> it was an emotional scene.
[21:25:44] <imode> kind of the point.
[21:26:04] <companion_cube> his character arc is that he keeps selling weapons
[21:26:08] <companion_cube> but just to the good guys
[21:26:09] <edm> but it's a kid's show and they're all 2d characters for teenage boys
[21:26:11] <companion_cube> right?
[21:26:29] <prussian> imode: who doesn't have Elon as a hero though...
[21:26:36] <imode> prussian: uh, most sane people.
[21:26:41] <edm> cinema can be a bit more nuanced than 'if scene == emotional: cry()'
[21:27:07] <companion_cube> NO
[21:27:25] <companion_cube> you also have to indicate who the bad guys are using obvious clues like goatees
[21:27:32] <prussian> o-oh..
[21:27:33] <imode> dr. strange hsa a goatee.
[21:27:34] <edm> facial disfigurements
[21:27:36] <manicennui> imode: I felt nothing when he died.
[21:27:42] <imode> cool.
[21:27:42] <edm> i was also really quite dissapointed with the latest Bond
[21:27:51] <manicennui> It felt like it was created specifically to try to create that emotion.
[21:27:57] <imode> yes. that's the idea.
[21:27:57] <manicennui> But I never gave a shit about most of the characters.
[21:28:01] <edm> it started off ok and just got a bit more tedious over almost 3 hours
[21:28:03] <imode> so why'd you see the movie.
[21:28:03] <companion_cube> edm: it wasn't a special-effect-inflation protected Bond>?
[21:28:08] <manicennui> I don't know.
[21:28:11] <companion_cube> 3h! damn
[21:28:14] <manicennui> I saw most of the MCU movies for some reason.
[21:28:14] <imode> sounds like a personal problem.
[21:28:16] <edm> yeah
[21:28:21] <edm> well it's 2hr 45 or something
[21:28:23] <manicennui> There are maybe a few that I think I really enjoyed.
[21:28:26] <edm> and my attention did start to wane
[21:28:48] <manicennui> Basically James Gunn and Taika Waititi are the only ones who can create MCU movies that I enjoy.
[21:28:59] <imode> the first iron man was good. the rest wasn't.
[21:29:10] <edm> it was mostly that i realised i had no idea why ramy malek's baddie character was particularly angry
[21:29:22] <edm> or why i should sympathise with his bg which i didn't really follow
[21:29:48] <edm> why he had a mad island with secret superweapon factories staffed by minions, it just doesn't really work anymore
[21:29:49] <manicennui> The motivations of most of the characters don't make a whole lot of sense.
[21:30:01] <manicennui> They do things because the bad writing needs them to do them to set up later bad writing.
[21:30:03] <edm> the campness of a 1960s connery bond is part of its pleasure
[21:30:19] <manicennui> Oh, you are talking about Bond.
[21:30:20] <edm> but trying to straddle both camps in this bond just lead to a sort of groin injury, metaphorically speaking
[21:30:22] <manicennui> I never got into Bond.
[21:30:23] <edm> yes
[21:30:49] <manicennui> Bond seems like action for old normies.
[21:30:58] <manicennui> Boomer action.
[21:31:04] <imode> you aren't wrong.
[21:31:13] <edm> i don't even know what that means

[21:31:18] <edm> what's action for young normies
[21:31:30] <manicennui> edm: Mostly inoffensive, a bit misogynistic...
[21:31:33] <manicennui> Not too interesting.
[21:31:45] <manicennui> edm: Woke and inoffensive.
[21:31:47] <edm> but yes in general it does seem to be being weighed down by its stylistic and hisotrical baggage. it hasn't translated v well to now
[21:32:06] <edm> bourne sort of broke it all for a modern cinema audience
[21:32:15] <manicennui> I have Bourne.
[21:32:20] <manicennui> Worst fight scenes.
[21:32:30] <manicennui> And it seems to have sparked that trend of bad shaky cam fights.
[21:32:34] <edm> and Le Carré was always the antidote to it all, but i can see why that doesn't get turned into hollywood blockbusters
[21:32:35] <manicennui> s/have/hate/
[21:32:46] <imode> all cinema sucks and whoever disagrees with me is wrong and cancelled.
[21:32:57] <manicennui> I disagree.
[21:33:06] <manicennui> But most cinema does suck.
[21:33:08] <imode> you are the problem.
[21:33:10] <manicennui> Just like everything else.
[21:33:26] <edm> 90% of everything etc
[21:33:51] <edm> but we really are on a bit of a strip-mining roll with all the cinematic universes
[21:33:53] <manicennui> The business of cinema has completely ruined it.
[21:34:03] <edm> won't shed a tear when they go out of fashion
[21:34:05] <manicennui> It was always a problem, but now they have dialed it up to 11.
[21:34:25] <manicennui> Just slap some CGI on some big mediocre actor.
[21:34:30] <manicennui> Follow the formula.
[21:34:58] <edm> dune I enjoyed
[21:35:05] <imode> semi-related but has anybody seen that god awful crypto.com ad with.. whatever the hell his name is.
[21:35:07] <imode> matt damon.
[21:35:16] <edm> if we're doing big-scale CGI-ey cinema, that was a happier recent example for me
[21:35:23] <imode> dune was definitely a movie.
[21:35:24] <manicennui> No, but I think I saw some Sam Jackson crypto credit card ad or something.
[21:35:36] <manicennui> edm: Haven't seen it yet.
[21:35:44] <manicennui> I have to be in the mood to pay attention for movies like that.
[21:35:45] <edm> and there's still good films coming out for genres i like, newsroom and legal and so on
[21:35:53] <edm> spotlight was probably my favourite of the recent batch

[21:37:34] <manicennui> I loved Pig, Ema, and Titane.
[21:37:41] <edm> and bridge of spies was a good spy film of course
[21:37:47] <imode> if that made you irrationally angry your ethics and morals center is functioning normally.
[21:38:00] <edm> my favourite tom hanks of recent times
[21:38:05] <manicennui> imode: Basically all crypto shit makes me angry.
[21:38:28] <manicennui> Just admit that you want to get rich quick and stop pretending that it solves any actual problems, cryptobros.
[21:39:12] <imode> I don't think they pretend.
[21:39:19] <companion_cube> certainly solves the problem of what to do with all that energy

[21:44:15] <dminkovsky> naa they're full of shit
[21:44:36] <companion_cube> I wonder, some of them must be earnest
[21:44:39] <dminkovsky> they're only not full of shit to the extent that they've internalized their bullshit and become part and parcel with it
[21:44:41] <companion_cube> but in what proportion?
[21:44:48] <manicennui> The only thing worse than the cryptocoin shit is the NFT shit.
[21:45:10] <imode> it's all the same to me.
[21:45:23] <manicennui> NFT adds bad art to the mix.
[21:45:25] <Xe> same grift, different wording
[21:46:12] <dminkovsky> the people i know who are into crypto are the exact same people i knew before who were into getting rich quick
[21:46:18] <dminkovsky> it's a solid observation by manicennui

[21:59:27] <dminkovsky> just seems like a person who's not completely tuned into whitespace still being, like, a form of delineation
[21:59:37] <dminkovsky> as in, there are characters there; you can, in fact, display them
[21:59:43] <dminkovsky> much like you could, if you wanted to, hide braces
[21:59:49] <dminkovsky> ~trippy~ i know
[22:00:02] <gwozniak> mind blown

[22:01:18] <Xe> imode: wow that is a good post
[22:03:10] <dminkovsky> there was nice "yaml sucks" "no yaml is fine" HN-style flamewar on HN yesterday
[22:03:26] <dminkovsky> i was tempted to drop my 2C but then reason got the best of me
[22:03:54] <dminkovsky> (just thought of it cause whitespace delineation)
[22:04:09] <companion_cube> I'm enjoying the premature optimisation post now
[22:04:17] <dminkovsky> there was a person at my mom's work who spent a good part of a day last week complaining about tabs/stapces
[22:04:20] <dminkovsky> spaces
[22:04:21] <imode> if you aren't embedding some form of JVM language as a configuration language then you suck and your self worth is that of a newt.
[22:04:26] <dminkovsky> and advocating STRONGLY for tabs in their work slack!
[22:04:44] <imode> I'm bitey today.
[22:04:52] <dminkovsky> imode: clojure as configuration
[22:05:01] <imode> configuration as clojure.
[22:05:01] <dminkovsky> it's perfect! code as data
[22:05:05] <dminkovsky> yes.
[22:05:18] <dminkovsky> ying-yang; the snake that eats its own ass;
[22:05:24] <imode> how can I convince the clojure compiler to compile my htaccess config.
[22:06:04] <dminkovsky> gradle
[22:06:46] <imode> underrated response.
[22:07:03] <Brekkjern> Bleh... I got curious about some dumb reddit thread and visited the sub it was from. I believe it caused damage :S
[22:07:26] <imode> do tell.
[22:07:37] <Brekkjern> I don't actually think you want to know...
[22:07:48] <imode> oh do I ever.
[22:08:07] <Brekkjern> Oh, you asked for it: https://old.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/qufbgq/the_goalposts_are_moving/
[22:08:08] <buttsbot> The goalposts are moving : kotakuinaction2
[22:08:24] <imode> oH BOY
[22:10:41] <imode> why did they fork the sub.
[22:10:48] <manicennui> Why are people surprised? Do they understand what the flu shot is?
[22:10:56] <imode> no, they don't.
[22:12:20] <Brekkjern> >I asked a covid worshiper friend of mine, how many boosters he’s willing to take in exchange for freedom to go to bars, and he just looked at me like [pc boot sound].
[22:12:20] <Brekkjern> Yeah. That expression they made is proooooobably because they didn't understand people could be as dumb as you.
[22:12:24] <companion_cube> oh noooooo
[22:12:27] <companion_cube> these people
[22:12:38] <companion_cube> "we may need regular boosters" and thy think it's all a grand plan??
[22:12:47] <manicennui> The last 4 years or so have shown how truly dumb most people are.
[22:13:01] <manicennui> Brexit, Trump, Covid...
[22:13:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[22:14:20] <imode> companion_cube: these are the same people who think food is a conspiracy because we all need to eat.
[22:14:30] <companion_cube> heh
[22:14:32] <manicennui> Before I thought that we had a lot of problems, but we were slowly making progress.
[22:14:36] <manicennui> Now I think we are pretty fucked.
[22:14:50] <companion_cube> so what's this subreddit?!
[22:14:54] <companion_cube> they all seem dumb
[22:15:17] <companion_cube> > That's fine. I'll keep my pure blood status instead.
[22:15:19] <imode> it's an alt-right haven.
[22:15:21] <companion_cube> oh hello neo nzi
[22:15:40] <manicennui> /r/cats is pretty good
[22:16:12] <companion_cube> r/hca is quite instructive
[22:16:20] <companion_cube> (well, r/hermancainaward)
[22:16:33] <manicennui> Reddit helped me discover this: https://i.redd.it/40usn4uk5yy71.jpg
[22:16:46] <imode> cute.
[22:21:20] <edm> during lockdown i caught myself actually browsing reddit a couple of times
[22:21:26] <edm> but decided that way lies madness
[22:21:50] <manicennui> I'm too far gone to stop.
[22:21:54] <Brekkjern> Reddit is "fine"
[22:22:08] <edm> like the this is fine fire meme
[22:22:10] <Brekkjern> The problem is when you dip into hellholes like the one I linked
[22:22:23] <imode> why would you not immediately turn heel.
[22:22:23] <edm> for me its utility is via google
[22:22:24] <imode> fuck that place.
[22:22:29] <edm> tech issues, product reviews, whatever
[22:22:41] <manicennui> I just wish that they'd remove the last few shit subreddits from /r/all, like /r/conservative.
[22:22:45] <edm> but just scrolling whilst my precious life ticks away is something i can do without
[22:22:54] <manicennui> I could also do without bullshit like /r/greentext
[22:22:54] <Brekkjern> If you curate your feed (like you are supposed to do) then it's a great platform
[22:23:00] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I mean... You can?
[22:23:01] <edm> for what
[22:23:11] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Sure, I do, but sometimes I want the randomness of /r/all.
[22:23:37] <edm> i suppose for right now, i am at work babysitting an experiment and doing some combination of admin and irc
[22:23:40] <Brekkjern> But why do you want to read the retardation that is posted to r/conservative?
[22:23:43] <edm> so it could do that
[22:23:48] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I don't.
[22:23:55] <manicennui> And it doesn't show up often.
[22:23:57] <Brekkjern> Then why not just filter it out?
[22:24:01] <manicennui> How?
[22:24:21] <manicennui> AFAIK there is no way to hide an entire subreddit.
[22:24:42] <Brekkjern> Dunno how to use the new interface, but in the old one when you are in r/all on the right hand side there is an "filter subreddit" field you can enter shit into
[22:25:10] <manicennui> That must be the problem.
[22:25:13] <edm> that they hell stuff is the default is probably reason enough to burn it all down though anyway
[22:25:26] <edm> they are as much a part of the problem as facebook at that point
[22:25:28] <manicennui> old is better for a lot of things, but the new design is "better" for just mindlessly scrolling and looking at images.
[22:26:01] <Brekkjern> I have RES installed, so I don't see any real improvements on the new design
[22:26:13] <manicennui> I wonder whether new will respect the filter from old.
[22:26:32] <edm> anyway i have an actual question. i'm making the world's 578938th static site generator for my own edification. of all the rss-esque specs i don't really understand, is there an obvious one i should try and implement for it?

[22:36:26] <manicennui> I can't see any way to modify it with new though.
[22:37:24] <manicennui> I'll never understand how bullshit like greentext hasn't been banned. It seems to mostly be a way to post thinly veiled homophobia and racism.

[22:41:16] <imode> delicious flesh.
[22:42:04] <Xe> JsonFeed is nice
[22:43:33] <dcz> is there a version of Stellaris without the battles? exploration is cool, getting owned not so much :P
[22:43:37] <companion_cube> greentext sounds like reposts from 4chan
[22:44:02] <manicennui> companion_cube: It is.
[22:44:21] <manicennui> Because more sites need to be infected with that nonsense apparently.
[22:47:00] <Brekkjern> dcz: Not that I know of, but it's also not all that difficult to defend yourself if you go for a defensive build and don't play on a too high difficulty level.
[22:47:52] <manicennui> Hard to make video games fun without murder.
[22:48:16] <Brekkjern> Well, in Stellaris' case it's not so much murder as it is genocide
[22:49:52] <dcz> I found that battles in star-themed games just stretched out too long. I'd rather see number-battles like in Civ
[22:50:44] <Brekkjern> The fights in Stellaris are rather quick
[22:51:11] <Brekkjern> You don't do any tactical stuff. Just point a fleet at another fleet and it will go on for a little while as you fuck around with other stuff
