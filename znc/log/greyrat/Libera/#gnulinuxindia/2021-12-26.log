[20:31:48] <NeoVoid[m]> quick question: what aria2c parameters you guyz use to download bigger file
[21:03:40] <Hemish[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "quick question: what aria2c..." <- I don't know, I use uget downloader (which is avilable in official arch repos), if you are using artix, it's not in artix repos (but you can use uget-git from aur)
[21:04:02] <Hemish[m]> It has two things in config: curl or aria2
[21:04:07] <Hemish[m]> So I have selected aria2 in that
[21:04:28] <Hemish[m]> It then does everything on its own, download has never failed for me even after killing the app
[21:04:42] <Hemish[m]> That's so lightweight app, and written in gtk
[21:04:43] <Hemish[m]> All opensource
[21:05:05] <Hemish[m]> It also has browser extensions for chrome, chromium, opera, firefox
[21:05:29] <Hemish[m]> And native host application for conecting with extensions is also in official arch repos (for artix, it's in aur(
[21:10:29] <Hemish[m]> Maybe you can see the parameters (it shows default parameters it is using in settings)
[21:39:25] <telegram_8037364> <NeoVoid[m]> "quick question: what aria2c..." <- just -x
[21:40:26] <telegram_8037364> <Hemish[m]> "I don't know, I use uget..." <- we can use arch repo on artix
[21:42:41] <telegram_8037364> * on artix, except core
[21:47:01] <Hemish[m]> <telegram_8037364> "we can use arch repo on artix" <- Didn't know that. Thank you
[21:47:14] <Hemish[m]> I literally changed artix to arch
[21:47:17] <Hemish[m]> Cuz I was having problems with packages
[23:00:40] <SurajKushwah[m]> <o0o> "@bugswriter what filter did..." <- I did nothing
[23:00:40] <SurajKushwah[m]> just
[23:00:40] <SurajKushwah[m]> convert input.jpg -resize 800 -strip output.jpg
[23:00:40] <SurajKushwah[m]> I downlaoded all images manually. over a time period of months.
