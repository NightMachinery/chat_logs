[00:18:43] <ski> you can say ⌜min(f) = 0⌝, where ⌜f(x) = (x − 5)²⌝. or you can cut to the chase, and say ⌜min(x ↦ (x − 5)²) = 0⌝ (since ⌜x ↦ (x − 5)²⌝ is a function (it's equal to ⌜f⌝ before) .. it's "the function that maps any input, call it ⌜x⌝, to ⌜(x − 5)²⌝)

[02:26:46] <ross> e.g. if I flipped the coin 2 times and it came up heads once, the uncertainty would be huge, but how can I find out how much? is there a metric?

[13:39:03] <riv> hi
[13:39:13] <riv> you need to show that algebraic + algebraic = algebraic
[13:39:18] <riv> and algebraic * algebraic = algebraic
[13:39:43] <greenbagels> are we looking at the same theorem?
[13:39:58] <riv> oh
[13:40:00] <riv> Theorem 5.21.25. The field A of all algebraic numbers is algebrically closed.
[13:40:02] <riv> lol
[13:40:04] <riv> "closed"
[13:40:10] <riv> nvm what i asid

[13:40:18] <greenbagels> not .25
[13:40:40] <cadmio> what it explained there makes sense but Idon't understand why at some point it stops considering A
[13:41:07] <riv> so we actually need to show that a root of P(X) in A[X] is algebraic
[13:41:28] <riv> we know that roots of P(X) in Z[X] are algebraic
[13:41:35] <cadmio> yes there is called f(x)
[13:42:19] <riv> so you know how i is a root of (X-i)
[13:42:40] <riv> you can for this new polynomial (X-i)(X+i) = X^2 + 1 by multiplying the polynomial by a complex conjugate
[13:42:51] <riv> this gives you a polynomial with real coefficients
[13:43:09] <riv> we can do the same process with a polynomial P(X) in A[X]
[13:43:29] <riv> just multiply it up with algebraic conjugates til you get a poly in Q[X], this proves the roots are all algebraic

[20:02:33] <orbisvicis> Z-module: strictly increasing in all arguments means that for each argument and for all values of all other arguments held constant, the function value increases when that argument increases. In other words, the partial derivatives of each argument are always positive. I was wondering the implications for all level sets of the function, ie if the level set was strictly decreasing in all arguments (see definition before, ie all partial derivatives).
[20:02:33] <orbisvicis> I seem to have demonstrated that using the implicit function theorem.

[22:38:55] <isekaijin> Z-module: Some people misleadingly state Cayley's theorem as “every group embeds in its own automorphism group”, which suggests taht G embeds into the group of *group* automorphisms G -> G.
[22:39:21] <isekaijin> Z-module: But the way you stated it emphasizes the triviality of the statement, which is nice.

[23:04:05] <Z-module> isekaijin: that's of course false, like with Aut(Z) = C_2.  Actually I was perversely pleased to find out that torsionfree abelian groups of *arbitrarily* large cardinlity exist having Aut = C_2.  And of course |G| > 2 means |Aut(G)| > 1 always, though I guess this is not a theorem of ZF alone.

[23:07:34] <johnkeats6> Z-module, abelian G or any?
[23:09:00] <Z-module> Any.  My favorite proof, because it doesn't distinguish finite/infinite G cases:  (1) If G is nonabelian, pick x not in Z(G), then conjugation by x is a non-identity automorphism.  (2) If G is abelian with an element of order > 2, then negation (= inversion) is a non-identity auto.   (3) If everything in G has order 2 or 1, then G is a vector space over F_2 in the only possible way, so pick some basis B for it: we have |B| > 1 since |G|
[23:09:00] <Z-module> > 2, so choose some two distinct b, b' in B, then the self-permutation of B that swaps b with b' and fixes everything else extends to an invertible F_2-linear operator on G, which is a non-identity group auto.

[23:16:42] <Z-module> That all orders <= 2 implying abelian is a very special case. There are nonabelian groups in which all non-identity elements have order 3.

[23:36:43] <antross> I have a newb question (almost embarassed to ask).  I have a server that can do 60k requests/second given that a single request takes 15 ms to complete.  I have another server where I'm trying to compute the requests / second given a single requests takes 200ms.  I thought the answer to this would be 15/60000 = 200/x and then I could use cross multiplication but the result is much larger than what
[23:36:45] <antross> it should be.  Instead, the answer is  15/200 x 60000 and I'm not understanding why I can't use ratios/cross multiplication for this.

[23:48:03] <isekaijin> antross: If a single request takes 200 ms to process, then you need to “chop” your 1 second interval into 200 ms “slices”, and the number of “slices” is the number of requests you can process in a single second.
[23:49:40] <isekaijin> (Well, I'm assuming that your requests are processed sequentially.)
[23:50:03] <isekaijin> (And that you can begin processing the next requests as soon as you're done with the previous one, with no delay in between requests.)

[23:51:30] <isekaijin> But anyway...
[23:53:08] <isekaijin> Is there any explanation of why one should care about Kan extensions? I don't care about category theory for its own sake, but I'm willing to learn it to the extent that it's useful elsewhere...
[23:54:06] <isekaijin> Kan extensions look to me like sort of “fat (co)limits”. Maybe they can even be defined as limits in some appropriate category.

[23:57:55] <antross> isekaijin: since both examples use ms as the latency, why do I need to use slices?
[23:57:58] <Guest1778> Can someone discuss with me phase portraits of a conservative system? Here we consider simple hamiltonian functions. For example, H(p,x) = p^2 / 2 -x^2/2 + x^3/3.
[23:57:58] <Guest1778> Here the kinetic energy is p^2/2 and the potential energy is V(x) = -x^2/2 + x^3/3. We can graph V(x) and note it has a saddle point at x = 0 and a center at x = 1. This potential energy well is a homoclinic orbit on the phase plane. What about outside of the well? How do the trajectories behave? To the right of x = 3/2, V(x) explodes up and
[23:57:59] <Guest1778> similarly to the left of x = 0, V(x) explodes down.
[23:59:16] <isekaijin> antross: Oh, I didn't know that the ms intervals were latencies. Then ignore what I said.
