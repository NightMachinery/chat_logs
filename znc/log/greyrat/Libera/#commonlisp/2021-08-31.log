[07:54:28] <mfiano> Regarding linear interpolation, and taking alexandria's function as an example, like most implementations, it names the parameters A, B, and V (usually T, but CL be like "nope"). I have an instance that computes and stores in one of its slots this "V" value to be later called. What to name this slot if I want to follow the convention of descriptively naming things...

[07:58:21] <edgar-rft> no matter how bad your name is, it will be better than mine
[07:58:50] <pillton> Wouldn't it just be the unit it represents? e.g. pixel position, time, angle
[08:00:21] <mfiano> This is part of a "clock" class with other "time"-named slots/accessors. This value is stored here based on timing information in the clock, for consumers of this class to use for vector algebra related things
[08:00:24] <pillton> Or "the domain" and "a and b" are the range.
[08:00:39] <mfiano> Trying to be not so ambiguous here...
[08:01:05] <pillton> Yeah so it is whatever the unit of time is.
[08:01:36] <mfiano> The unit of time is actually variable, depending on the system.
[08:01:59] <mfiano> THere is a slot called units-per-second, which is what the RTC will return

[08:12:30] <mfiano> I don't think that's a term common to linear algebra.
[08:13:06] <mfiano> It's usually called "v" in math contexts, or "alpha" in color blending...but I don't think I've seen anything else
[08:13:14] <mfiano> err "t" in math
[08:14:08] <moon-child> yes; as you mentioned it's usually t, but we can't use that in cl.  The question is, why choose v?
[08:14:38] <mfiano> because they didn't want to shadow T :)
[08:15:24] <moon-child> i feel like we're walking in circles
[08:15:59] <mfiano> I've seen coefficient and factor used, but they don't sound right at all
[08:17:48] <mfiano> in alpha blending, T is typically called the "alpha _v_alue. could be why
[08:20:58] <mfiano> Anyway, I wanted to associate the slot with interpolation, since that can't be inferred from the class it is part of. So "interpolation-domain" or "interpolation-value" is good enough

[10:07:38] <moon-child> aeth: I was being apocryphal :)
[10:08:43] <aeth> but t really is the most unfortunate name conflict in CL because usually when given a numerical algorithm you just keep the letter that everyone else uses because... they're so general, that they don't really stand for anything so variable names don't really apply
[10:11:23] <aeth> (sure, in Physics it generally means "time", but that's just one application of the generalized math)
[10:11:59] <moon-child> I think you're already giving up quite a lot compared with traditional mathematical notation; the loss of a single variable name pales
[10:13:09] <aeth> It matters because it's what every textbook has, so it's what anyone is trained to recognize as the "accepted" variable for a given numerical algorithm. Put differently, you don't need to call pi CL:PI since names are arbitrary, but it helps
[10:14:28] <aeth> It's just one variable name conflict, though, so it doesn't make it unrecognizable
[10:15:06] <aeth> You could switch to a Scheme reader where t is a new T and #t is CL:T, though (-:

[11:16:43] <mfiano> It depends how you look at it. CL's type system is a little different than most languages.
[11:17:33] <lotuseater> it is
[11:18:48] <akater[m]> nil is the least element w.r.t subtype.  I don't think this leaves much for interpretation.
[11:19:06] <moon-child> I don't see why it shouldn't be a bottom type.  But the spec has an interesting example:  (subtypep 'nil '(member))  is either true or indeterminate

[13:15:13] *** Joins: VincentVega (~user@185.66.254.237)
[13:16:49] <pjb> mfiano: you can also write a reader macros to define docstrings.  Note that macros are not evaluated on docstring: if it's a non-string, it's not a docstring.
[13:19:49] <mfiano> I don't like altering the readtable because named-readtables or such taints everything all the way down to requiring the consumer of the library to switch back to the standard readtable.
[13:23:08] <pjb> mfiano: the readtable used to read the sources is unrelated to the user readtables.
[13:25:14] <mfiano> Well, the reason for using a macro was to avoid the extra syntax. I prefer my parens, thanks :)
[13:28:26] <pjb> mfiano: you can use a macro (or a function) if you use #. to read a string returned by the operator.
[13:28:45] <pjb> eg. #.(doc "foo" "bar" "baz") with new-lines, etc.
[13:35:07] <mfiano> I mentioned that above I used a macro to avoid that extra syntaxz
[13:38:22] <pve> Is there a problem with docstrings that span multiple lines?
[13:38:48] <White_Flame> just indentation gets weird
[13:40:19] <pve> oh, you mean it indents subsequent lines to column 0
[13:49:23] <beach> pve: You have a choice.  Either it looks weird in source code because you have text that starts in column 0, or it looks weird when it is printed because subsequent lines have leading spaces.

[14:09:26] <beach> Either way, the entire DOCUMENTATION system is broken.  For one thing, it does not allow for internationalization.  Furthermore, it does not allow for things like links, semantic markup, etc.
[14:10:02] <beach> Luckily, the DOCUMENTATION system is kind of separate from everything else, so providing a separate system for documentation won't hurt.
[14:23:39] <mfiano> I think "broken" is the wrong adjective here.
[14:24:23] <pve> I guess I meant more of a local post-processing, like for a single project where I "know" the docstrings are safe to mangle.

[20:34:40] <aadcg> I'm wondering if smth can give me a hand with SBCL's function run-program
[20:35:06] <aadcg> I would like to run a program and to set some env variables
[20:35:12] <aadcg> (run-program "ls" '("-la") :environment '("TIME_STYLE=full-iso") :search "/usr/bin/" :output *standard-output*)
[20:35:56] <aadcg> the above doesn't work... but when I remove the :environment tag it does work! how do you set env vars when using run-program?
[20:36:34] <lotuseater> hm or look into the UIOP manual, maybe there is more information about it (and not just SBCL specific first)
[20:37:17] <aadcg> thank you lotuseater
[20:38:39] <lotuseater> but also sorry as i didn't use that much yet, just can give potential hints
[20:39:13] <lotuseater> or that: https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/os.html
[20:39:19] <aadcg> you've helped already
[20:39:27] <aadcg> but there's smth I'm also confused about
[20:39:37] <aadcg> uiop is an external library correct?
[20:40:14] <aadcg> that comes with asdf, correct?
[20:40:50] <Bike> yes. people use the portable run-program it has a lot.
[20:41:30] <aadcg> so there's a run-program in sbcl, and another in uiop.  am I correct?
[20:41:35] <Bike> yes.
[20:42:58] <Bike> sbcl's is documented here: http://sbcl.org/manual/#Running-external-programs
[20:43:00] <lotuseater> aadcg: so one of the goals of a lib like UIOP is portability between impls, like with CFFI
[20:43:16] <lotuseater> but correct me if I'm wrong, always possible
[20:43:23] <aadcg> lotuseater: makes sense
[20:43:57] <lotuseater> so it calls the specific routines/functions whatever that SBCL or so provide for the same thing
[20:44:11] <aadcg> thanks Bike.  I read that from the comfort of emacs :)

[20:46:03] <Bike> it works as i'd expect on my system. i.e., with the :environment '("TIME_STYLE=full-iso"), i get the full-iso output, and without it i don't.

[20:47:37] <Bike> yep.
[20:47:45] <aadcg> it might be because I'm on Guix

[20:48:26] <aadcg> this is absolutely mind boggling :)
[20:48:47] <lotuseater> ah cool guix :)
[20:49:01] <aadcg> Bike: I tried on Xterm and it did work properly
[20:49:09] <Bike> like, does `TIME_STYLE=full-iso /usr/bin/ls -la` in a terminal get you what you expect? just to sanity check
[20:49:14] <Bike> well alright then
[20:50:14] <aadcg> wait...
[20:50:19] <aadcg> that might explain it
[20:50:26] <aadcg> that doesn't work indeed
[20:50:48] <aadcg> what I did before was: export TIME_STYLE=full-iso RET ls -la
[20:51:09] <aadcg> basically guix creates a /usr/bin with a symlink as far as I understand...

[22:20:47] <Fade> :(
[22:21:24] <lotuseater> would totally fit into the show i'm currently watching, "Grimm"
[22:21:33] <lotuseater> and how are you?
[22:21:56] <yitzi> lotuseater: I kinda like it.
[22:21:56] <Fade> I'm good.
[22:22:18] <lotuseater> okay good
[22:22:30] <Fade> I think this vision of the lisp alien will not do good things for the recruitment stats. :)
[22:22:43] <Fade> I watched that show a few years ago.
[22:22:48] <lotuseater> haha yes, the cute version is indeed the best
[22:23:55] <lotuseater> yes me too a bundle of episodes with my ex, and now i wanted to see the whole story, very cool and as much is bound to German stuff and tales and such for me as a German it's even cooler and another point of view sometimes

[22:27:36] <Fade> uhm.. well I learned lisp shallowly in the 1990's, but I converted to common lisp for all my own work when it became clear that Python was not going to be backward compatible in the 2->3 shift.
[22:28:01] <lotuseater> wow a veteran then :)
[22:28:28] <Fade> I had a lot of python code that needed rewriting, and I thought if I'm going to rewrite it anyhow, why not do it in a fast language with a good object system.
[22:28:33] <lotuseater> so much software still relies on python 2 ∘_○
[22:28:48] <Fade> that python2/3 thing has been an utter disaster.

[22:30:51] <Fade> I like pandas
[22:31:08] <lotuseater> and not fitting your problem with just the things others think are good
[22:31:09] <Fade> I'm playing around with vellum on a personal project I'm working on
[22:31:16] <lotuseater> yes me too, back then
[22:32:00] <lotuseater> i thought about if a port subset port would be something, then also using April (APL compiler) for it to shorten code even more
[22:32:20] <lotuseater> ah someone showed me vellum some days ago, for data frames
[22:32:38] <Fade> I haven't gone far enough yet to know how it compares to pandas.
[22:32:52] <lotuseater> okay
[22:32:54] <Fade> but I expect it will be simple to add missing features as I encounter them.
[22:32:58] <lotuseater> pandas is big
[22:33:00] <Fade> if I do.
[22:33:08] <Fade> the data loader ecosystem for pandas is impressive.
[22:33:30] <lotuseater> or this networkx python lib for doing things with graphs is also interesting
[22:34:21] <lotuseater> yes, so that would also be important to bring foreign people to use a potential port
[22:34:46] <lotuseater> "hey, surely you can your Excel 'Databases' with it"
[22:35:03] <Fade> I think we write libraries for the users we have, and worry about the users we don't... well, not so much.
[22:35:25] <lotuseater> and providing them a DSL helps too :)
[22:37:05] <lotuseater> "Oh this alternative pandas installation is way faster, how did Python evolve so well?" "No, it's in CL." :D

[23:31:06] <Fade> but, there's about 9000% too much syntax for me.

[23:44:54] <lotuseater> and the syntax is not the problem, right to left evaluation ^^ so "2×3+4" gets 14 and not 10
[23:46:42] <lotuseater> and for applying a function "backwards" from left the ⍨ operator is quite useful :D
[23:47:09] <waleee> lotuseater: then you have stuff like 1 % 3 which evaluates it's argument in left->right
[23:47:22] <waleee> % = j-equivalent of the APL divide op
[23:47:43] <waleee> ÷
[23:48:14] <lotuseater> oho
[23:49:49] <lotuseater> but things like "1 2 3○2" to map functions on a value and not just values on a function is funny, so the one principle of functional programming
[23:50:27] <lotuseater> J is indeed also very interesting
[23:52:46] <waleee> There is someone who tried to write an editor in J
[23:52:50] <waleee> * someone insane
[23:53:05] <lotuseater> phew
[23:53:07] <waleee> https://youtu.be/4RAv8K4w66c
[23:53:22] <lotuseater> hm but doing it in APL is not soo insane
[23:54:02] <lotuseater> but you want to be able to work with data structures like ropes in text editors
[23:54:27] <jcowan> Arrays of strings are perfectly fine
[23:55:09] <lotuseater> they are but not for everything
[23:55:36] <lotuseater> thx, and haha a 5h stream :D
[23:56:18] <lotuseater> Stallman coded a text editor in APL back in ancient pre-Emacs times
[23:59:57] <lotuseater> or using enclosed arrays
