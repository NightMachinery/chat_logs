[21:14:34] <osan[m]> has anyone experienced notes disappearing from the db if the `ROAM_ALIAS` property is added? the note doesn't get reindexed afterward even if nuke the db
[21:15:41] <osan[m]> and weirder still is that even if i remove the alias property and nuke the db the file still doesn't get reindexed. and its not like there's some file weirdness because the diff is identical to prior to adding the alias
