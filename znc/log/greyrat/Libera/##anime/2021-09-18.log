[01:41:35] <mixfix41> also the reasons you give about the drawbacks of vtubers are entirely personal. thats why you miss the big picture. if you do mention negative things about them they have their own chat even for that but obviously you wouldnt even say that there.

[02:20:59] <Berlin36> oh i see

[02:21:09] <Berlin36> what is wrong with registering anon

[06:54:12] <Nanobot> Spending $50 for 12 pieces of fried chicken. Feels bad.
[06:54:30] <ButterNoodle> yea remember when KFC was cheap?
[06:54:48] <Nanobot> I'm trying Popeye's, actually. Never tried it before.
[06:54:58] <Nanobot> But KFC is basically the same price.
[06:55:08] <ButterNoodle> not impressed with either
[06:55:51] <Nanobot> The grocery store fried chicken is a bit better and much cheaper, but it's only available for like three hours of the day.
[06:56:04] <ButterNoodle> I've never woke up in the morning, had my first fap of the day, and thought I really need a 12 piece bucket of original recipe
[06:56:30] <ButterNoodle> ahhh Nanobot.. my grocery store is the same.. they have a line out the door almost waiting for it
[06:56:54] <MootPoot> I wonder if I can fit in a large card right next to my gpu
[06:57:03] <ButterNoodle> depends
[06:57:39] <ButterNoodle> if its a founders it should clear it
[06:57:53] <ButterNoodle> the fan is gonna be way out of the way of the 10g card
[06:58:14] <ButterNoodle> its just clearance between the gpu 8x slot and the neighboring 4-8x slot
[06:58:25] <ButterNoodle> *should be fine

[11:06:49] <isekaijin> Matt|home: hi btw
[11:06:54] <Nanobot> isekaijin: It's a game that's made to be frustrating, and she decided to make it even harder by taking a drink of alcohol every time she makes a "big fall" (which is like 2+ screens)
[11:07:24] <isekaijin> Oh, so it is not even someone else daring her to?
[11:07:45] <Nanobot> amigojapan: Jump King is a game where you try to climb up and up and up, involving lots of tricky jumps. If you miss a jump, you can end up fall back down multiple screens.
[11:08:08] <Nanobot> isekaijin: Nope. Just her way of making it more interesting, I guess. And an excuse to drink alcohol on stream.
[11:08:18] <isekaijin> Fun.
[11:08:25] <amigojapan> Ah ok Nanobot I think I know what it is
[11:09:00] <Nanobot> She's kinda known for being kinda bad at games. Her focus is more on music.
[11:09:24] <beaky> it's kawaii when she games
[11:09:39] <amigojapan> Nanobot: I am bad at modern games
[11:09:42] <Nanobot> But she's about as good at games as I am, so I guess that says something about me.
[11:09:59] <isekaijin> That should not stop you from playing.
[11:10:07] <isekaijin> I am bad at having luck, and yet I still play gacha games.
[11:10:24] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I will only play old games
[11:10:26] <beaky> we need to up our game to the level of vtuber
[11:10:35] <beaky> and ganbaru
[11:10:36] <Nanobot> I have zero interest in gacha games. RNG doesn't excite me.

[11:11:40] <amigojapan> isekaijin: no. I just don't like modern games
[11:11:44] <isekaijin> beaky: To the level of, like, Aqua or Korone?

[12:24:38] <DunceCotus> time itself ended and was replaced by persistent now
[12:24:45] <mixfix41> ofc its a synonym for hacking
[12:25:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: absolutely nothing happened

[12:25:24] <MootPoot> 007, everything is nothing
[12:25:32] <MootPoot> or*
[12:25:35] <MootPoot> lol
[12:25:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: ever wonder why the 2010s seemed to be obsessed with reboots and throwbacks to prior decades?
[12:26:12] <DunceCotus> well that's cause new things became harder to create with no future or past to contextualise the new presentism
[12:26:18] <amigojapan> No DunceCotus . They want to milk cash cows
[12:26:22] <MootPoot> ecchi amigojapan 
[12:26:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yes but why were they popular enough to become cash cows
[12:26:57] <DunceCotus> nostalgia wave came because of this end of time 
[12:27:10] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: 80s movies were actually original
[12:27:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: in the 80s we still had past and future
[12:28:10] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: after 2012 the past we draw from is not the actual past of the new world
[12:28:18] <DunceCotus> its a past from a deceased world
[12:28:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: same thing happened I speculate around the mid-19th century
[12:28:57] <DunceCotus> the Victorian era was a mourning culture
[12:29:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I don't know why you need to think this
[12:29:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: however the 2012 point was the end of time as we knew it
[12:29:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: based on my experience
[12:30:22] <DunceCotus> and an analysis of culture throughout 2010s and onwards
[12:30:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: my experience is different
[12:30:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we experienced backward ripples of the end of time as early as 2009
[12:30:54] <MootPoot> sex
[12:31:00] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  have you stopped cooking
[12:31:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah pretty much
[12:31:28] <MootPoot> too lazy?
[12:31:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the question is.. what ended time and the world as we knew it? I have a feeling CERN has some involvement
[12:31:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: now I am just eating frankfurters
[12:31:50] <MootPoot> lol
[12:32:10] <MootPoot> are you ripping off Stiens:gate now DunceCotus 
[12:32:32] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: Steins:Gate was simply drawing from the unconscious knowledge of this
[12:33:16] <DunceCotus> the antediluvians had time travelled but hit a wall at end of 2012
[12:33:28] <DunceCotus> so they figured some juncture had occurred around then
[12:34:12] <amigojapan> Wacky
[12:34:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the Earth has gone through many cataclysms but mostly the were physical
[12:34:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but you should write a story
[12:34:41] <DunceCotus> the 2012 cataclysm was metaphysical
[12:34:55] <DunceCotus> it had a different form from the cataclysms that preceded it
[12:35:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the world was rebuilt to imitate the deceased world
[12:35:53] <DunceCotus> but this new world works on new principles so in many ways the old world doesn't fit with this new one
[12:35:56] <MootPoot> I need to strech more
[12:36:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: for example, the synchronicity in this new world is turned up to eleventy stupid
[12:36:48] <jessedesu_onaph> Stretch
[12:36:50] <DunceCotus> that's to remind us basically that the new world doesn't have to follow the same rules as the old

[12:40:14] <MootPoot> then why are you in your phone
[12:40:28] <DunceCotus> because the conditions for imitating the old world required edits to the timeline

[12:45:40] <DunceCotus> some people only have a past in the old world
[12:46:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but ultimately this new world does not work as a present in relation to a past and a future.. it is simply always now
[12:47:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that is to say it is the growing pains of becoming accustomed to this ever-present state that we still have semblance of the past and future -- but these are probably nothing more than defense mechanisms
[12:47:55] <mixfix41> are energy beams involve?

[12:51:00] <DunceCotus> we all made fun of the predictions of apocalpyse
[12:51:14] <DunceCotus> but that was because we were thinking too narrowly
[12:51:37] <DunceCotus> equating apocalypse with a literal, physical end of the world
[12:51:42] <DunceCotus> and not something more metaphysical

[16:40:02] <DunceCotus> the question is why

[16:44:47] <darkwitch> yes, there may be a comeback
[16:44:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: rave was very open to everyone
[16:45:34] <DunceCotus> diverse groups of people coming together, united in dance
[16:45:59] <DunceCotus> these days dance clubs have been captured by capitalism and have naturally become cynical, exclusionary affairs
[16:46:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: not my kind of thing.i hated night clubs too
[16:46:10] <DunceCotus> less drug taking doesn't necessarily mean a better scene
[16:46:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: underground raves were nothing like night clubs
[16:47:10] <DunceCotus> night clubs was the capture of dance/electronic music by capitalism
[16:47:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sorry but I was never even invited to a rave

[16:48:28] <Sadale> well, maybe we could hold such an event inside something like VR Chat.
[16:48:39] <Sadale> DunceCotus, why? the virus?
[16:48:46] <DunceCotus> Sadale: well that among other reasons
[16:49:06] <DunceCotus> a lot of the land used to make the factories/venues was captured by real estate

[16:55:34] <darkwitch> true, they say armaf has changed the original club de nuit so it's no longer what it used to be
[16:56:13] <DunceCotus> capitalism is continually restricting free movement and free desiring production
[16:56:14] <amigojapan> darkwitch: that sounds like it would smell like cigarettes and cheap presume

[16:58:56] <DunceCotus> we must lockdown. Why? To stabilise the economy. We must vaccinate? Why? To go back to 'normality'

[17:05:09] <darkwitch> it's already later rather than sooner Sadale
[17:05:45] <darkwitch> amigojapan, a salary for what? you don't need that if it's based on charity
[17:05:46] <amigojapan> darkwitch: Sadale is saving money too retire early
[17:05:59] <Sadale> While I don't like capitalism, I don't think I have any means nor power to change that. So I'm now just saving up money. Hopefully I could retire at 40.
[17:06:40] <Sadale> I really just have to live with this stupid capitalism world. :/
[17:06:41] <amigojapan> darkwitch: you can have both. I don't think a society based on charity is sustainable
[17:07:00] <darkwitch> then it's not an alternative to business

[18:08:29] <SpiritOfSummer> everybody will still get each other sick either way, the number of cases won't change, it will probably actually go down because people can't spread the disease after they're dead

[18:24:43] <emmeka> Sadale I do. it's legal here, afterall.
[18:25:01] <Sadale> It makes me wonder why SpiritOfSummer seems to be relunctant to ask the actual question here.
[18:25:11] <SpiritOfSummer> what question is that?
[18:25:21] <Sadale> question about growing weed
[18:25:36] <emmeka> I grow my 4 plant limit, but don't smoke much of it myself. If I smoke weed, I just acquire snacks, eat the snacks, and then fall asleep, all within about 15 minutes
[18:25:47] <SpiritOfSummer> Sadale: that wasn't meant to hint that I have another question
[18:25:51] <Sadale> oh
[18:25:57] <Sadale> ah. I see :3
[18:26:03] <SpiritOfSummer> what I was asking is that once I begin to grow weed, if questions emerged, I was asking if emmeka woudl be able to help
[18:26:04] <emmeka> mostly it ends up as Christmas presents
[18:26:09] <Sadale> aha
[18:26:11] <SpiritOfSummer> but apparently I stereotyped his ass

[18:26:44] <emmeka> if you're growing it illegally? sure.
[18:26:51] <Sadale> oh I mean legally.
[18:27:04] <Sadale> BTW, weed isn't legal here. And I've never took it.
[18:27:06] <emmeka> the legal market is quickly stablizing, and there's a lot of big fish already dominating the market.
[18:27:12] <Sadale> ouch
[18:27:24] <emmeka> I wouldn't touch that market, personally
[18:27:32] <SpiritOfSummer> as long as it's run by locals I wouldn't mind that

[18:37:21] <SpiritOfSummer> fuckin stupid to announce it as a 2021 thing at that point
[18:37:23] <amigojapan> !seen guest56
[18:37:23] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: guest56 was last seen in ##anime 16 hours and 20 minutes ago: <Guest56> SpiritOfSummer you're right and i agre with you
[18:37:29] <SpiritOfSummer> like 1 or 2 episodes will actually come out in 2021
[18:37:37] <SpiritOfSummer> the arc is a 2022 thing, i waited this whole year thinking it was coming
[18:38:03] <SpiritOfSummer> the funny thing is that's the exact kind of behavior they had in absolutely BLOATING the story when converting the manga to anime
[18:38:12] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: have you ever even tried shoujo?
[18:39:03] <SpiritOfSummer> I have not
[18:39:12] <amigojapan> I see

[18:56:16] <amigojapan> Sadale:  Cryowolf said he would write a novel about witches where witches are cursed people, but they gain the power of the curse, but the only way they can break free from the curse is by eating the heart of those who cursed them
[18:57:06] <Cryowolf> not about them, they'd just be a part of the world :P
[18:57:14] <Sadale> amigojapan, lol
[18:57:26] <amigojapan> Ah ok Cryowolf 
[18:58:06] <Cryowolf> Don't even know how much of that will reach the final draft, this isn't even early draft. I'm just throwing things at a wall to see what sticks
[18:58:32] <DunceCotus> why is weed such a taboo
[18:58:47] <Sadale> You could use my poop to stick your things onto the wall. My poop sticks well :3

[18:59:15] <DunceCotus> why is alcohol not a taboo
[18:59:27] <darkwitch> poop feeling slippers
[18:59:37] <Sadale> DunceCotus, so that the alcohol companies could sell their shit? :P
[18:59:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: alcoholism is a taboo
[19:00:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: is it?
[19:00:05] <amigojapan> Lol darkwitch 
[19:00:14] <amigojapan> Yes DunceCotus 
[19:01:16] <DunceCotus> there's a line with alcoholism
[19:01:30] <DunceCotus> having a drink or two a night isn't considered alcoholism
[19:01:35] <DunceCotus> even though in long term that could mean problems
[19:01:49] <DunceCotus> getting 'wasted' is the taboo I think
[19:02:22] <DunceCotus> 'losing yourself' with tools is a taboo
[19:02:33] <DunceCotus> 'losing yourself' with dreaming or meditation? That's a good thing
[19:02:38] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: my grandmother used to drink a vodka tonic before bed every night, are lived to be 97
[19:02:52] <Cryowolf> I thought either they eat the heart of the one who cast the curse, consuming part of their soul and healing the curse. Or they infuse a dagger made from the bone of a demon with their blood and stab the one who cursed them through the heart (again their soul) and sort of "returning" the curse
[19:03:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: perhaps if she hadn't she would have lived twice as long

[19:05:39] <amigojapan> Lol Urchin[emacs] 
[19:05:56] <Cryowolf> Of course there are other ways to be cursed, which makes being cured even harder. If for example someone curses you with their dying breath
[19:06:46] <amigojapan> darkwitch: are you supposed to put poop inside? Is that what the leaks are for?
[19:07:02] <DunceCotus> curse of the heart
[19:07:23] <darkwitch> amigojapan, do you want the poop to leak?
[19:07:44] <Cryowolf> because in the world I'm creating, the soul(or spirit, or astral form etc) is anchored to the heart of the physical body
[19:07:50] <amigojapan> darkwitch: hmm depends where I am stepping
[19:08:27] <darkwitch> the believe the leak points are for draining water
[19:08:40] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf would the last breath count even in suiciding?
[19:08:54] <darkwitch> the poop is just a chinese to english mistranslation
[19:09:04] <amigojapan> darkwitch: yeah, I was just kidding
[19:09:15] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, well yes, I mean they're taking away an easy out for the curse
[19:09:46] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf 
[19:10:07] <amigojapan> I wonder what will be my last words
[19:11:07] <amigojapan> If it is anything like my grandma and my father I will say I will sue the hospital for malpractice
[19:11:23] <Cryowolf> I'm trying to think of other ways a curse can be removed. Maybe by cursing someone else with the curse you have. Moving it onto another. But to make it harder, that person needs to be very innocent to the point where it hasn't had the chance to even voice out a cry. Pretty much curse an unborn child
[19:12:06] <Cryowolf> if someone is willing to do that, they can be rid of the curse. But they taint their soul in malice
[19:12:23] <Urchin[emacs]> !seen tsunderenoises
[19:12:23] <ImoutoBot> Urchin[emacs]: tsunderenoises was last seen in ##anime 7 days and 16 hours ago: <TsundereNoises> a groan is basically the ideal response for a joke like that, so it works well
[19:13:17] <Cryowolf> right now Im just throwing out ideas and world building. I need a world with rules and such for my story to take place in. I can't come up with everything on the spot because then it might break its own rules and continuity
[19:13:19] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: in Mexico people believed in evil eye in the time my mom was a baby. Her mom put an amulet of ambar on her for that. And if the answer burst, they said "someone tried to curse her

[19:15:40] <amigojapan> Thanks Cryowolf 
[19:15:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Omega037: I just read using mcomix
[19:16:34] <Cryowolf> I would love to be painted up by a very good artist on the day of the dead
[19:16:41] <Omega037> i got my son CDisplyEX for his chromebook, but that is best when you have CBR/CBZ files ready
[19:17:41] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I think that can be arranged, tho I don't know a very good artist personally. Maybe Jesse only
[19:18:10] <Urchin[emacs]> Omega037: I don't have much use for a program specifically managing those, I just move files around as I need to through the console
[19:19:44] <Cryowolf> I just had the idea that in my world, if someone puts a heart in a certain type of box designed by a mage and alchemist. To keep the heart beating and essentially "alive" that this binds or imprisons the soul to the physical realm and keeps them from moving "on" to whereever that is after death
[19:20:11] <Cryowolf> it's a difficult and expensive box to make or they'd be everywhere
[19:21:01] <Sadale> :/
[19:21:09] <Urchin[emacs]> Pirates of the Caribbean?
[19:21:12] <Cryowolf> Sadale, what?
[19:21:13] <Sadale> My NiMH AA battery charger is whispering :(
[19:21:19] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], hmmm?
[19:21:25] <Sadale> The sound. It's kind of annoying.
[19:21:57] <Cryowolf> well the box idea is nothing new, I think its been used in dark fantasy for hundreds of years
[19:22:53] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: also in day of the dead in Mexico. They write poems instead of news on news papers. The name of these poems is Calaberas (skulls) and they are written about living famous people but as if they were dead
[19:23:25] <Cryowolf> but I figured there could be actual prisons for this sort of thing. Where instead of being hanged and your soul moving on. Your soul has to spend a certain amount of years trapped, unable to move on. This punishment would be for those who have commited crimes deserving of worse than death
[19:24:00] <Cryowolf> pretty much placing them in limbo
[19:24:13] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, interesting
[19:24:43] <amigojapan> Ty Cryowolf 
[19:25:30] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, question...If someone who wasn't hispanic participated in the day of the dead by painting up and such, would you feel happy that they want to take part in your culture and experience that. Or would you be angry a "white dude is appropriating your culture" ?
[19:26:49] <Cryowolf> If they did it to be part of it, not to mock it
[19:27:39] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: actually I think the painting up part is a note recent thing probably taken from Halloween. When I was a child we did not do that
[19:28:42] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: but it is pretty
[19:29:16] <Cryowolf> or maybe it came from Spain, I'm gonna look into that more. But yes there are some very talented artists that create the most vexing painting
[19:29:30] <Cryowolf> is the dancing a tradition though?
[19:29:55] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the day of the dead came from the Aztecs
[19:30:20] <amigojapan> Sure the Catholic church takes things from pagans too
[19:30:39] <Cryowolf> ah, Spain has something similar though. So maybe that's why it blended well, or maybe that was imported to Spain from the Aztecs
[19:30:49] <Cryowolf> but at the time Spain was very christian
[19:31:43] <amigojapan> Catholic. Catholicism had made a tradition of chriatianizing pagan traditions
[19:31:54] <Cryowolf> but one thing Christianity did to get others to join them was adopt parts of their traditions and merge them into their own, as if they were always a part of it
[19:32:05] <Cryowolf> yeah I know, there's a lot of that history in Sweden

[19:32:41] <Cryowolf> they took the more manipulative approach instead of brute force
[19:32:52] <amigojapan> Right
[19:33:17] <Cryowolf> I think though it took longer, it invited less resistance

[19:33:47] <Cryowolf> not sure if I do
[19:34:28] <Cryowolf> maybe, but I heard of it differently or just heard of it without knowing what
[19:34:30] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: they made a dark skinned Virgin Mary with a Hispanic name to be the Mexican Virgin.

[19:41:31] <Cryowolf> religion was ultimately a tool to control people because before the times of science, what better way to keep people in line than to have them think certain actions would damn their souls
[19:41:51] <Cryowolf> and also some ways to recruit people to war, to fight for God etc
[19:42:51] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: https://images.app.goo.gl/hSrNUhRSMpJZYu9a9
[19:43:05] <Cryowolf> The Inquisition was a tragedy, I believe spurred on by Islam encroaching on Catholic lands with war and Imams etc. So to keep their holy lands pure and theirs, they had to root out any threat

[19:43:49] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: ah
[19:44:18] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I am not sure how effective it is. People seem to jump so t from religion to religion all the time
[19:44:34] <amigojapan> Jump ship*
[19:44:41] <Cryowolf> everyone is responsible for their actions and if their response to an invading force of a different religion was to start an inquisition against innocent people, that was their evil to commit
[19:45:21] <Cryowolf> and Islam was also a means of control as a religion but more focused on warfare since it came during the unification of warring Tribes
[19:45:24] <Cryowolf> and War Lords
[19:45:44] <Cryowolf> it has some good teachins as well, I'm not saying it's "the book of evil"
[19:46:06] <Cryowolf> but I'm trying to give my perspective on how I think religions were motivated
[19:46:37] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: as a Mexican I am glad when someone likes our traditions and extra to celebrate them
[19:46:56] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: no matter their race or place
[19:46:57] <Cryowolf> Buddhism I believe was more of a religion for escapism. For those wanting to escape the horrors of the world and find simplicity
[19:47:27] <Cryowolf> but then it kinda diverged where one side went to war and the other didn't
[19:47:29] <amigojapan> Wants to celebrate*
[19:47:39] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, nice
[19:47:54] <Cryowolf> Im glad when people take part in Swedish tradition too, especially the silly ones
[19:48:00] <Cryowolf> to watch how awkward they feel
[19:48:08] <Cryowolf> it's funny at the asme time
[19:49:08] <Cryowolf> Did Hinduism combine a bunch of beliefs and gods into one to unify people or were they all part of it to begin with?
[19:49:43] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: if I had not participated in a omikoshi carrying in Japan. I would not of met a key person in meeting my wife. It almost feels like destiny. I met her in a drunk stuppor
[19:50:10] <Cryowolf> how very Japanese of you
[19:50:29] <Cryowolf> unironically :)
[19:50:41] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I think all god's and people are said to be just the dream of Brahman in Hinduism
[19:50:51] <amigojapan> :)
[19:51:27] <Cryowolf> it's interesting that different houses worship different gods within Hinduism
[19:51:55] <amigojapan> Same in shintoism
[19:52:31] <Cryowolf> isnt that more the, maybe not worship but "praying" to spirits?
[19:52:45] <Cryowolf> rather than gods
[19:52:57] <Cryowolf> unless you count the actual gods 
[19:53:07] <Cryowolf> of the sun and the moon

[19:53:43] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: but everything has a Kami in shintoism
[19:54:21] <amigojapan> How you translate Kami may affect your interpretation of it
[19:55:09] <Cryowolf> maybe I should have a religion in my world that believes all life came from a God sacrificing itself to create a giant mountain surrounded by large forests, lakes and rivers and that outside of that is only a desert. So the people worship the dead God and his guardians, for saving them
[19:55:59] <Cryowolf> since theyve been isolated for so long, they never thought there was any other life
[19:56:17] <amigojapan> An oasis
[19:56:22] <Cryowolf> as treks through the desert isn't something anyone takes easy
[19:56:44] <Cryowolf> well an oasis the size of let's say Austria
[19:56:53] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[19:57:05] <Cryowolf> in the middle of a desert the size of the sahara
[19:57:09] <Cryowolf> well maybe half of austria
[19:57:16] <amigojapan> I see
[19:57:18] <Cryowolf> and a third is taken up by the mountain
[19:57:37] <Cryowolf> but nobody really survived passing the desert since it can get so hot it turns sand into glass
[19:58:00] <amigojapan> That's really hot
[19:58:01] <Cryowolf> so they live there thinking its the only place in existence where life exists
[19:58:43] <Cryowolf> yeah the heat comes from underneath meeting with the sun above and being 1000 meters below water
[19:58:55] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: will someone venture out? Or will someone come from outside?
[19:59:55] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: that seems hard that anyone without high tech could ever reach it
[20:00:05] <Cryowolf> an empire will have the bright idea to turn the desert into ocean so they can travel to its center (which does lie 1000 meters above the desert)
[20:00:42] <amigojapan> I see, using magic?
[20:00:46] <Cryowolf> so they will basically blast away the rock formations and such protecting the desert
[20:00:53] <Cryowolf> I dont know
[20:00:59] <amigojapan> Ok
[20:01:00] <Cryowolf> I havent decided on the strength of magic
[20:01:09] <amigojapan> Ok
[20:01:19] <Cryowolf> but the empire will basically drown out the desert

[20:04:10] <Cryowolf> the desert lies 1000 meters below the ocean
[20:04:21] <Cryowolf> which is part of the reason for why its so hot there
[20:04:24] <amigojapan> Alright
[20:04:51] <Cryowolf> if they simply open up parts like sleuces and let the water fill the hole
