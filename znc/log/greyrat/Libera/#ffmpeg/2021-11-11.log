I get errors like "[libx264 @ 0000017470c7dd80] Error setting option x264-params to value
[05:45:48] <Keshl> visualize." if I don't specify it in the form of a key=value pair, and errors like "[libx264 @ 000001e94b8737c0] Error parsing option 'visualize = true'." if I do. Am I doing something wrong? Does --visualize even exist anymore? x264's manpage says it does, but I'm starting to doubt that.
[05:46:37] <`St0ner> when converting .webm audio to .wav using CLI ( ffmpeg -hide_banner -y -vn -i "<SourceFileName>" "E:\<OutputFileName>.wav" ), the audio hashes match exactly. however, when converting the .wav to ALAC, the hashes don't match. the CLI i'm using is (ffmpeg -y -hide_banner -vn -i "<SourceFileName>" -acodec alac "E:\<OutputFileName>.m4a"). why the audio hash mismatch for lossless encoding?

[16:10:17] <roxlu> Hi, I've asked about this yesterday in #ffmpeg-devel, but that might have been the wrong channel.  (...)
[16:11:14] <roxlu> When I have a decoder and want to pass the decoded frames to several encoder threads (into a queue), I assume I have to allocate a new AVFrame for each decoded frame as each enocder needs to hold on to the frame in a buffer/queue so it can process it w/e it's ready?
[16:17:44] <JEEB> if you handle the refcounts correctly, the logic will handle that for you if they need a writable AVFrame
[16:19:24] <roxlu> Thanks JEEB, it's more that my decoder loop will decode as fast as possible, so I receive a frame and then I have to pass it to the encoder which might not be able to deal with it directly. If I would use the same frame var for `avcodec_receive_frame()` it would overwrite the one I just passed to the encoders, right?

[16:43:11] <BtbN> You just need to properly refcount your frames as you use them yourself
[16:45:04] <roxlu> BtbN: ok thanks, so when I do `AVFrame* frame = av_frame_alloc()` I can pass that into `avcodec_receive_frame()` in a loop? wouldn't the members of `frame` be overwritten and therefore invalid making the previous frame (which is passed to the other threads) useless?

[16:48:17] <BtbN> What do you mean?
[16:48:38] <BtbN> If you keep overwriting the same frame you're not holding the only reference to, you're actively violating the whole concept of ref counting
[16:48:59] <roxlu> ok yeah I guess that answers my question
[16:49:18] <roxlu> I think my question is too trivial
[16:51:36] <roxlu> When you see this pseudo code: https://gist.github.com/roxlu/94b7f1e4e9d35e9fb4e1f31273478766
[16:52:13] <roxlu> that's most likely an incorrect implementation

[20:49:49] *** Trieste_ is now known as Trieste
[20:49:56] <furq> in general you shouldn't use output seeking unless input seeking just doesn't work
[20:50:13] <furq> last i checked it was broken for mpegts but maybe someone fixed that
[20:51:27] <Trieste> Hi, I'd like to encode a video so that it's requires as little resources to decode as possible (it's going to be played on a raspi and there should be no hiccups), any recommended options? Does that even make sense?
[20:52:18] <intrac> furq: yeah, I use .ts files frequently so I read it was best to avoid that method
[20:52:33] <furq> Trieste: the rpi has hardware decoding so you just want something that falls within the specs it supports
[20:53:08] <furq> high profile h.264 level 4.1 should work on all of them
[20:55:24] <Trieste> furq: right, I'm just wondering if I can safe it even further... like encode with a keyframe every second or somesuch
[20:56:28] <furq> shouldn't be any need to
[21:06:28] <intrac> furq: do you know if ffmpeg actually does a full decode for each frame?
[21:06:55] <furq> yeah it does
[21:06:57] <intrac> I thought video bitstreams normally have payload information for each frame (eg I/B/P)
[21:07:14] <intrac> ah ok
[21:07:15] <furq> -ss after -i just discards everything produced by the decoder up to that timestamp
[21:07:48] <intrac> I just thought in theory it should only be necessary to scan and detect each frame header
[21:08:10] <furq> there's probably more efficient ways of doing it but it'd depend on the codec
[21:08:14] <intrac> yep
[21:08:26] <intrac> I guess this method is robust and doesn't require any per-codec hacks
[21:10:18] <furq> that's the compromise you have to make when trying to deal with every format under the sun
[21:10:58] <furq> it's not that big of a deal really since container level seeking usually works

[23:35:36] <markizano> I'm doing something like: ffmpeg -i mp4 -i mp4 -filter_complex "[1:v]scale[v1];[1:v][v0]overlay[video]"
[23:35:49] <markizano> and video ends up with just an image from the 2nd input video.
[23:36:46] <markizano> I was in this channel before as Kizano - so I know I'm running the latest ffmpeg now :)
[23:38:47] <kepstin> nah, overlay works fine with video over video. Can't tell what's going wrong with your command because it's incomplete and fully of typos
[23:38:53] <kepstin> note that the overlay filter matches timestamps between the input videos.
[23:39:20] <markizano> even with enable='between()' ?

[23:43:15] <kepstin> I'd have to double-check the code to make sure, but I think when disabled, the overlay filter passes through the first input, and reads/discards from the second input?
[23:44:13] <kepstin> oh, or is it using the external enable provided by the framework... i'm not sure how that behaves, tbh
[23:45:14] <markizano> enable doesn't appear to be part of the options specifically for overlay, so I think it's global to ffmpeg's functions.
[23:45:51] <kepstin> ah, it's using TIMELINE_INTERNAL mode, so the filter is still doing some frame handling when disabled
[23:46:02] <kepstin> not entirely sure what it's doing tho.

[23:53:39] <kepstin> yeah, so i think this is a timestamp misalignment issue. your pki video at the time of the [pki] pad runs from timestamps 0 to 3.8, but the overlay is only enabled from timestamps 7 to 10.8
[23:53:53] <kepstin> so by the time the overlay is enabled, the pki video is already over, so it just holds the last frame

[23:54:49] <kepstin> you can probably fix this by using the setpts filter to adjust the start time of the pki video before using it as an overlay
[23:58:25] <furq> setpts=PTS+7/TB
[23:59:02] <furq> i guess if you do that you can replace between with eof_action=pass
[23:59:11] <furq> not sure how that works before the stream starts though
