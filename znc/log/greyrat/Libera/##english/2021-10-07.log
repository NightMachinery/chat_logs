[01:46:50] <twb> doesn't "private equity" just mean "shit a person has" ?
[01:48:25] <mdogg> Yep.  Pretty much.
[01:48:37] <twb> How can that be a career
[01:48:52] <mdogg> Or, the value of that..
[01:48:57] <mdogg> I'm not sure.
[01:48:57] <GuiToris> I have a problem with this sentence: 'Can you imagine she ran off with that guy?'
[01:49:03] <GuiToris> does this make sense?
[01:49:13] <twb> "Hi, I'm Alice, my job is to help you... have stuff"
[01:50:08] <mdogg> GuiToris: I would probably replace 'imagine' with 'believe'.  But other than that, it looks alright to me.  
[01:50:56] <GuiToris> mdogg, my problem is the past tense of run there
[01:51:24] <GuiToris> it feels like the person is referring to future and not the past
[01:51:52] <GuiToris> it's not hypothetical, is it?
[01:52:02] <mdogg> Acutally, taking the sentence as a whole, it is about something she did...
[01:52:21] <GuiToris> so it happened, she's gone
[01:52:31] <GuiToris> then I misunderstood the sentence
[01:52:50] <mdogg> For example, "My wife divorced me and ran off and married my business partner."
[01:54:05] <GuiToris> thank you, I didn't want to believe it was a past action
[01:54:24] <GuiToris> I'll fix my translation, I used future
[01:54:57] <mdogg> Ahh.  Yes.  It isn't future.  It is something that she did - even though she may currently be "running" with him, she ran off with him at some point.
[01:55:12] <GuiToris> thank you :)

[01:58:57] <GuiToris> I'd love it too, but it's not mutual, it doesn't want me to learn it!
[01:59:58] <GuiToris> every time I feel I understand English well, I just watch a stupid YT video that ruins all my dreams
[02:00:05] <mdogg> English is not an easy language to learn.  And many native English speakers do not speak proper English. 
[02:01:06] <GuiToris> yeah, but the problem is that many native ones don't speak English properly but still more proper than mine
[02:01:08] <mdogg> What is your native language?
[02:01:42] <GuiToris> I tend not to give out this top secret information

[02:04:35] <GuiToris> mdogg, I've been curious about these lyrics for a while now. Let me show you this part
[02:06:04] <GuiToris> this is from Girl from Oklahoma by Steel Panther https://bpa.st/raw/7ANA   So I looked it up, I almost had to look up every other word in urban dictionary
[02:06:15] <GuiToris> I'm not asking you to paraphrase it
[02:06:36] <GuiToris> I am wondering if this is something that everyone would understand
[02:07:41] <mdogg> I take it to mean that she accepts and loves him no matter what.  
[02:08:14] <mdogg> Poetry is taking the language to a different level, though.  It isn't always easy to understand.

[02:08:43] <mdogg> It's not good poetry..
[02:08:45] <mdogg> lol
[02:09:10] <mdogg> It's pretty much shit.
[02:09:18] <GuiToris> I often find their lyrics offensive
[02:09:52] <GuiToris> I was wondering if these words are understood by everyone; zit, box, fox
[02:11:11] <mdogg> In fact, what she is saying is just like telling a girl, "Hey, you may just be a 4 in Manhattan, but here in Long Island, you are a solid 9."

[02:14:24] <GuiToris> my question may not have been well phrased, but apparently you do understand what the lyrics mean
[02:14:55] <GuiToris> without urbandictionary I would have no chance to decode that lyrics
[02:15:15] <mdogg> Wo?
[02:15:16] <GuiToris> you know it's not something that teachers teach here
[02:15:17] <mdogg> So?
[02:15:51] <mdogg> It's something that will come in time.  I will never learn French or German without living in the country.

[08:53:00] <fentanyl> Is this correct? Given that, mentioning about that information is giving undue weight to those unrelated events which happen to take place within same timeline.
[08:53:43] <porphyry> fentanyl: "... within *the* same timeline."
[08:53:49] <fentanyl> alright.
[08:54:26] <porphyry> fentanyl: but you could try to make it less complicated. it sounds too bureaucratic now. is that your target audience?
[08:55:15] <fentanyl> porphyry: Yeah :) It's a forum of learned people. 
[08:55:32] <porphyry> fentanyl: men of letters, huh?
[08:55:39] <fentanyl> heh
[08:56:59] <vonunov> It's rather unwieldy even for an intellectual audience. What comes before it? Is it short enough to include in the same sentence? I would use something like "Given that [reason], ..." or "For that reason, mentioning [the information by name, if possible] gives undue weight to unrelated events that happen to take place at the same time."
[08:57:36] <porphyry> vonunov: i agree.
[08:58:17] <porphyry> fentanyl: the flow is a little unnatural. it sounds like a boring Senate hearing.
[08:58:23] <fentanyl> "that happen to take place" or "which happen to take place"?
[08:58:45] <porphyry> fentanyl: both are correct but you could try to introduce some active voice there.
[08:59:03] *** Joins: powermail (uid385576@id-385576.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[09:02:43] <vonunov> The rule is supposed to be that 'which' is used for nonrestrictive clauses (meaning they can be removed without changing the overall meaning of the sentence) like "Stacy's truck, {which is painted red,} has a dent in the back bumper" vs. a restrictive like "Laptops {that are used for gaming purposes} are usually more expensive"
[09:02:57] <vonunov> but it's not uncommon to see a restrictive which
[09:04:06] <porphyry> vonunov: i see.
[09:07:16] <vonunov> Changing things like "giving weight" to "gives weight" and removing extra words can make a great difference in readability without compromising the meaning. I still have trouble with it myself. It sometimes seems too simplistic when I get it trimmed down
[09:08:18] <vonunov> https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20180877 This is always a good read IMO
[09:08:57] <fentanyl> Hmm, will give that a read.
[09:09:26] <vonunov> There are some dated ideas like insisting on different meanings of "due to" and "owing to", but the spirit of it is still useful
[09:10:28] <fentanyl> I also try to write in passive voice because I don't wanna take responsibility or make myself actively involved (tryna evade), so I try to write the sentence in passive voice.
[09:10:30] <porphyry> fentanyl: George Orwell also has some good suggestions in the essay "Politics and the English Language".
[09:10:41] <porphyry> fentanyl: that's not a good idea.
[09:11:00] <vonunov> What's the risk? It's not even in first person :P

[09:21:54] <porphyry> fentanyl: the essay is not about politics at all. it's about the use of English to be a better writer and see through the tricks commonly employed by public orators and writers.
[09:35:05] <vonunov> You can also keep the benefits of active voice (clear and concise) while offloading the responsibility to someone else, or even to nobody in particular, especially when talking about what someone (or some vague group) believes, suggests, etc. (e.g. "It is believed that ..." vs. "Scientists commonly agree that ..." or "A Johns Hopkins research team believes ..."
[09:36:26] <vonunov> To be fair, some situations may call for the passive voice, some of which are listed here https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/ccs_activevoice/
[09:37:41] <vonunov> The motivation here for using the passive voice may be similar to that of the last example on that page ("Visitors are not allowed after 9:00 p.m.") -- it's not that this is any more authoritative than "We don't allow visitors after 9", I think it's really that there's nobody to argue with :P

[14:21:13] <darsie> I mean, can ethanol be harmful even if it's just resting in a sealed bottle?
[14:21:20] <darsie> It's classified as harmful.
[14:21:57] <darsie> Or does something have to cause harm to be harmful?
[14:22:37] <StayHungry> harmful -> capable of causing harm
[14:24:07] <darsie> ok
[14:24:43] <StayHungry> (Collins dictionary) something that is harmful has a bad effect on something else, especially on a person's health.
[14:25:18] <darsie> Ethanol in a sealed bottle doesn't have a bad effect.
[14:26:22] <kurahaupo> It's more nuanced than that. More like "presents a significant risk of causing harm, subject to any constraints specified (if any)". Water isn't harmful, but water a metre deep in your bedroom is harmful.
[14:26:27] <StayHungry> it does not matter whether it is sealed or not, harmful related to the bottle, refers not to the bottle, but to the contents

[15:59:29] <cyphrCat> if I say: “Can you please give me information on this account[?/:] «newline» ‘xyz123foobar’” what should the punctuation be, question mark or colon?

[16:01:42] <kurahaupo> cyphrCat: Generally label: value, with a question mark after value
[16:02:03] <kurahaupo> but I would omit the word "this"
[16:02:19] <kurahaupo> Why does there have to be a newline?
[16:03:13] <cyphrCat> that’s what i would do if all appears in a sentence.  But in this case I have a newline and the account number is centered, in bold print, with a frame around to make it loud and clear.
[16:03:56] <cyphrCat> so the question mark would seem quite awkward if it appeared to be part of the acct number
[16:05:17] <cyphrCat> i suppose if it weren’t phrased as a question, I would just omit the period and the reader wouldn't really wonder where the punctuation went
[16:05:48] <cyphrCat> but a missing question mark might leave the reader hanging
[16:06:45] <cyphrCat> One temptation is to put the question mark on the next line after the acct number, on the line by itself
[16:08:59] <cyphrCat> fuck it that's what i'll do.. there’s probably no hard and fast answer to this.

[17:09:46] <node1> It sounds like to be rebellion of something injustice happens from higher authority!!

[18:01:01] <huf> what an unfortunate choice of nick :)
[18:01:10] <GuiToris> hello; 'I'd like you to read out this sentence with a falling intonation'  is this sentence good and my intention is understandable?
[18:01:43] <node1> Also i would likes to know where to look for synonym of any phrase or sentence?

[18:04:56] <GuiToris> darsie, it was more dangerous than a t-rex

[18:05:07] <darsie> :)
[18:05:13] <GuiToris> bintober, do you think 'falling intonation' is countable or uncountable?
[18:05:31] <GuiToris> the dictionary says Intonation: [uncountable and countable]
[18:05:45] <GuiToris> does it mean it's up to me?
[18:07:33] <pussipupu> It means it can be used both ways

[18:08:12] <bintober> nobody else has even mentioned or noticed that

[18:08:14] <huf> bintober: yeah, but also bint.

[18:30:08] <bintober> on the flipside, my step-dad's ex-wife is named Karen and apparently she is the ultimate Karen
[18:31:08] <Looney> it was just a matter of parsing all those verbs I guess. You used "you say", "it allowed", and "it sounds" too close to each other to make sense, so then I realized you actually meant "aloud"

[20:37:10] <fentanyl> This is a warning that if they keep violating a policy, *I* (or someone, which is unlikely) would take them to court.
[20:40:53] <bin_bat> "Please read our policies and be aware that repeated violation may result in legal action"
[20:41:02] <bin_bat> s/ion/ions/
[20:41:02] <chat> bin_bat meant to say: "Please read our policies and be aware that repeated violations may result in legal action"
[20:41:33] <fentanyl> Yeah, but I explicitly wanna mention a *place* like court or police station.
[20:41:59] <fentanyl> In this case, what'd be your suggestion?
[20:42:53] <bin_bat> "violators will be prosecuted"
[20:42:58] <bin_bat> why do you want to mention a place?
[20:43:06] <bin_bat> it's not like you can physically drag them to the courthouse
[20:43:29] <fentanyl> Because, I'd be using this type of sentence in a situation where a *place* is involved.

[20:45:18] <fentanyl> For example, in certain places, if we need to complain about an internet user, we will open a ticket in a particluar place for admin's action, like "admin notices" section. So, that's virtually a *place* so if they violate a policy, I'd complain about them in that section or place such that an admin might ban them.
[20:46:01] <bin_bat> that has absolutely nothing to do with the law though
[20:46:04] <bin_bat> or court
[20:46:29] <fentanyl> Yeah, but I guess it's similar.
[20:46:32] <bin_bat> no it isn't
[20:46:50] <fentanyl> Ok. Fine. Could you give me a suggestion in this case?
[20:46:55] <bin_bat> "Please read our policies and be aware that repeated violations may result in the termination of your account"
[20:48:04] <fentanyl> I'm not gonna terminate their account. All I do is open a ticker in that section of the website. So I guess "termination of your account" is bit strong, which I don't want. Also it might not even result in termination of their account or anything too harmful.
[20:48:34] <bin_bat> so like nothing actually happens?
[20:49:09] <fentanyl> They'd get a admin warning (which is a strong response)
[20:49:18] <bin_bat> and then what?
[20:49:37] <fentanyl> well, that's upto to admin to decide.
[20:49:44] <fentanyl> s/to//
[20:49:45] <chat> fentanyl meant to say: well, that's up to admin to decide.
[20:49:56] <bin_bat> presumably the worst case scenario would be account termination, right?
[20:50:03] <fentanyl> hmm, yeah
[20:50:08] <bin_bat> I mean just giving warnings over and over is not very useful
[20:50:23] <bin_bat> You want the warning to make them follow the policies
[20:50:37] <bin_bat> so saying "follow the policies or you get a warning" is not going to persuade anyone
[20:50:38] <StayHungry> fentanyl: 'Please, read our policy on this issue. A repeat violation will result in a lawsuit.'
[20:50:55] <bin_bat> "follow the policies or you'll get a note on your account record" is also not going to persuade anyone
[20:51:05] <bin_bat> the warning has to be about what the final scenario will be
[20:51:36] <bin_bat> in the US there are often signs that say "violators will be prosecuted"
[20:51:54] <bin_bat> that doesn't mean they will be prosecuted every single time, but it means that is the potential consequence
[20:52:06] <fentanyl> Ok, is this sentence grammatically correct or not? "Please read this policy, repeated violation would take you to ANI"
[20:52:25] <fentanyl> yeah?
[20:52:37] <bin_bat> what is ANI
[20:53:33] <fentanyl> ANI is a place to open a ticket and to get attention of an administrator to take a look at the issue.
[20:54:02] <fentanyl> To be specific, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents
[20:54:53] <bin_bat> is that supposed to be threatening though?
[20:55:01] <bin_bat> that doesn't sound threatening to me

[20:59:39] <fentanyl> That was my reply.
[20:59:56] <fentanyl> Am I grammatically correct in that reply? (or we call it edit summary)
[20:59:58] <bin_bat> but how is going to take you anqyqhere?
[21:00:00] <bin_bat> anywhere**
[21:00:11] <fentanyl> take me anywhere?
[21:00:22] <bin_bat> you say it's going to "take you to WP:AN3"
[21:00:45] <bin_bat> It's going to physically put me there? It's going to put my account in there?
[21:01:05] <fentanyl> No, it's not taking me. I'm saying to "Rodney Araujo" that if you repeately edit-war, I'll report you to WP:AN3
[21:01:13] <bin_bat> so then say report
[21:01:27] <bin_bat> nobody is being taken anywhere
[21:01:58] <bin_bat> "Repeated violations will be reported to WP:AN3"
[21:02:23] <bin_bat> or in this case
[21:02:31] <bin_bat> "Repeated edit-warring will be reported to WP:AN3"
[21:02:42] <fentanyl> alright.
[21:03:04] <bin_bat> does that make more sense? 
[21:03:30] <fentanyl> Yeah, but I just thought "would take you to WP:AN3" sounds more cool.
[21:03:36] <bin_bat> but it's not correct
[21:03:58] <bin_bat> it's not like you actually go anywhere right?

[22:40:26] <bin_bat> black
[22:40:28] <bin_bat> In heraldry, sable (/ˈseɪbəl/) is the tincture black, and belongs to the class of dark tinctures, called "colours".
[22:40:30] <blkshp> Purple, final answer.
[22:40:45] <bin_bat> which is weird because in animals it's very different
