[00:00:44] <gwern> of course, $300m to stop a nuke that you spent $300b encouraging to launch isn't a bargin either
[00:00:48] <kuudes> how much does a nuke cost?
[00:01:35] <ggreer> I don't know alibaba is out of them
[00:01:43] <gwern> my understanding was that the fixed costs and surrounding costs of things like delivery platforms far outweigh the marginal cost
[00:02:15] <ggreer> an ICBM is probably about the same cost as any rocket: tens of millions of dollars
[00:02:33] <kuudes> why wouldn't the enemy just launch 2 nukes if you have abm?
[00:02:58] <gwern> or balloon decoys and chaff or whatnot, yes
[00:03:35] <ggreer> the US has 44 interceptors operational right now. you'd have to launch 5-10 nukes to have a high probability of getting through
[00:03:56] <kuudes> so, north korea?
[00:04:37] <gwern> that's been the post-Star Wars justification, yeah
[00:04:40] <gwern> 'rogue states'
[00:04:50] <ggreer> yeah or a rogue actor in russia/china/etc
[00:04:58] <kuudes> but indeed - the only winning move is not to play. but while you may be uninterested of nukes, they are interested of you, etc etc
[00:05:12] <ggreer> (or russia/china/etc trying to nuke a couple places and attempting to blame it on a rogue actor)
[00:06:47] <ggreer> the US's GMD is tested against decoys and usually ignores them
[00:08:35] <gwern> (like Iron Dome: israel is just so much wealthier than hezbollah, that with an active defense attacking rocket launchers as soon as they pop up, constant degradation of hezbollah capabilities, and huge constant R&D and scaling iron dome missile defense, it pretty much works)
[00:09:39] <ggreer> also the latest GMD tests were without warning. they set up the whole system and said "we're gonna launch a fake ICBM at some point in the future" and then the 100th missile defense brigade intercepted it
[00:10:42] <ggreer> george w bush withdrawing from the ABM treaty was a smart move
[00:12:33] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-135_anti-ballistic_missile_system in typical russian fashion, their ABM is just "shoot nukes at the nukes"
[00:12:34] <Robomot> A-135 anti-ballistic missile system - Wikipedia (The A-135 (NATO: ABM-4 Gorgon) is a Russian anti-ballistic missile system deployed around Moscow to intercept incoming warheads targeting the city or its surrounding areas. The system was designed in the Soviet Union and entered service in 1995. It is a successor to the previous A-35, and complies with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.[2])
[00:16:53] <gwern> seems like it'd make the problem a lot easier. kinda hard to test tho
[00:17:31] <ggreer> yeah

[00:20:48] <zebrask> This is why abandoning the goal of conquering the moon was so short-sighted.

[00:21:45] <two2thehead> if i could make one change during the cold war, I'd get the soviets to make a public pronouncement of having a communist moon base

Orders placed by KAMAZ to procure construction materials and equipment were filled by all the ministries and departments, a total of over 2,000 enterprises. Over 100,000 personnel were employed at the construction site itself. The
[08:42:16] <quanticle> would-be truck plant was being provided with the most state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment by the contemporary standards. More than 700 international firms were among equipment vendors for KAMAZ facilities, including such globally known corporations as Swindell-Dressler, Holcroft, CE-Cast, Ingersoll Rand, Ex-Cello (U.S.A.), Hueller-Hille, Liebherr (West Germany), Morando, Fiat (Italy),
[08:42:18] <quanticle> Renault (France), Sandvik (Sweden), Komatsu and Hitachi (Japan). [...] The Complex of Plants on the Kama River sprawled over a vast territory measuring 57 square km. Concurrent to construction of the truck plant, huge social challenges were tackled. Hundreds of thousands of people were provided by KAMAZ with comfortable housing, modern educational facilities, kindergartens and creches, hospitals
[08:42:20] <quanticle> and clinics, numerous cultural, sporting, recreational and leisure centers. KAMAZ was instrumental in transforming the Kama River Area into a powerful industrial and scientific research hub and developing the infrastructure for the suburban agricultural zone."

[10:53:37] <feep[work]> I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that there are two major ways to encode an object that can have one of three possible values, and one is *wrong wrong wrong.*
[10:53:49] <feep[work]> (in json)
[10:54:19] <feep[work]> there's { "type": "foo", "value": { "a": 2 } } ... { "type": "bar", "value": { "b": 5 } }
[10:54:22] <feep[work]> this is the wrong one
[10:54:42] <feep[work]> the right one is { "value": { "foo": { "a": 2 } } } ... { "value": { "bar": { "b": 5 } } }
[10:55:32] <feep[work]> why is the first one wrong? well, it's not wrong in js, or node, because js/node are dynamic languages that don't give any sort of shit about small allocations
[10:55:53] <feep[work]> but in a strongly typed compiled optimized language where you can use ~stream parsers~ which are made of ~candy and goodness~
[10:56:04] <feep[work]> you can decode the second one in one pass, but you need two passes for the first one.
[10:56:24] <feep[work]> this is because in the second one, the type of any object is entirely specified by its field name.
[10:57:14] <feep[work]> support your local stream parsers, encode sum types as a number of fields in an object, only one of which is set
[10:57:21] <feep[work]> that is all

[14:51:31] <PapuaHardyNet> basically I wrote an MVP network and tried to converge it. If it doesn't converge, well, something is wrong. Found sources of numerical instability using this, and replaced exp() * exp() with exp(log_a + log_b), for example

[15:09:31] <gurkenglas> The window is also well-insulated against noise, but I'd like to keep it open in the day
[15:09:38] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't think they exist, you can't "cancel" out soundwaves, afaik
[15:09:58] <gurkenglas> it sure is mathematically possible
[15:10:07] <gurkenglas> especially if it's only supposed to work on whereever i am in the room
[15:10:10] <PapuaHardyNet> "Active noise control (ANC), also known as noise cancellation (NC), or active noise reduction (ANR), is a method for reducing unwanted sound by the addition of a second sound specifically designed to cancel the first." huh

[15:15:41] <gurkenglas> from the way that waves appear to travel around corners, i would imagine that an array of microphones and speakers at the frame of my window should be in a great position to cancel out any sound whose source i cant currently see
[15:16:05] <gurkenglas> s/appear/appear from a google search/
[15:17:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I would recommend buying noise cancelling headphones instead
[15:17:29] <gurkenglas> and if i can see it right through the middle of the aperture, it should be a reduction in decibels that depends on my distance to the window
[15:18:50] <gurkenglas> noise cancelling headphones block sounds from inside the house too, though. though i suppose that may be configurable
[15:18:59] <gurkenglas> but also they're bulky.
[15:23:10] <gurkenglas> if the noisecancelling apparatus knows where I am, it'd work even when i can see the source of the sound, though it'd mean up to 6 more decibels of noise to other people in the room

[15:26:10] <gurkenglas> here i am, closing the window to block sound and watching "10 Hours of Chainsaw" to figure out sound profiles
[15:27:51] <PapuaHardyNet> Honestly, if you can pull it off I'd be amazed. I assume you just need microphones and speakers, yeah.
[15:29:58] <nshepperd2> noise cancelling headphones have an easier time because they don't need to estimate the profile of the noise wavefront
[15:30:49] <gurkenglas> about 250 Hz, 343 metres per second in air, so it'd be about 0.7 metres between where the sound is doubled and deleted

[17:40:14] <gwern> gurkenglas: my understanding was that you can't have 'remote' active noise canceling because the cancellation only happens in a specific small volume of space where the two sound waves destructively interfere and cancel out there. everywhere else they don't cancel out. it would need to specifically track your ears and target that volume. I read about a luxury car manufacturer investigating...
[17:40:20] <gwern> ...that sort of thing but even there they are only aiming at reaching out a few feet

[17:49:11] <Robomot> The Wicked Problem Experience | LessWrong (I’ve spent a lot of my career working on wicked problems: problems that are vaguely defined, where there’s no clear goal for exactly what I’m trying to do or how I’ll know when or whether I’ve done it. In particular, minimal-trust investigations - trying to understand some topic or argument myself (what charity to donate to, whether civilization is declining, …)
[17:49:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I feel like it tells us more/less/different than what Holden wants it to tell us
[17:50:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "One of the fun things about the GiveWell example is that the final product that came out at the end of that process was actually pretty bad!" ... yes, "fun", that is the word
[17:51:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It had essentially nothing in common with the version of GiveWell that first started feeling satisfying to donors and moving serious money, a few years later. (No overlap in top charities, very little overlap in methodology.)" ... and yet you're still focused on saving lives in Africa, specifically, even though you just said that originally you made this choice *totally arbitrarily* for *no actual reason at all*
[17:51:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> What a coincidence!
[17:52:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I kept waiting for the part where he goes "... and finally I realized the obvious: that the problem wasn't 'how do I write coherently about what we've done', but rather that what we'd done was mostly useless and our whole approach and plan and philosophy was comprehensively flawed and bad"
[17:52:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it never came
[17:53:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I have a deep sense that I have something to say that is worth arguing for, but I don’t actually know _what_ I am trying to say." ... but then how are you so sure that what you have to say is anything useful or correct or ... anything? Your "deep sense"? That's it?
[17:53:52] <synthmeat> fire in the belly
[17:53:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I’m approaching a well-established literature with an idiosyncratic angle, giving me constant impostor syndrome. On any given narrow point, there are a hundred people who each have a hundred times as much knowledge as I do; it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that despite this, I have _some_ sort of value-added to offer (I just need to not overplay what this is, and often I don’t have a really crisp sense of what it
[17:53:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  is)." ... HOW DO YOU KNOW
[17:54:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There’s nothing to stop me from sinking weeks into some impossible and ill-conceived version of my project that I could’ve avoided just by, like, rephrasing one of my sentences. (The above GiveWell example has me trying to do extra work to establish a bunch of points that I ultimately just needed to sidestep, as you can see from the final product. This definitely isn’t always the answer, but it can happen.)" ... but my
[17:54:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  dude, this is ACTUALLY A VERY BAD SIGN
[17:55:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There aren’t any well-recognized standards I can make sure I’m meeting, and the scope of the question I’m trying to answer is so large that I generally have a creeping sense that I’m producing something way too shot through with guesswork and subjective judgment to cause anyone to actually change their mind." ... yes! Indeed! Except change that last clause to "... to be useful or correct in any way"!
[17:55:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "All of these things are true, and they’re all part of the picture. But nothing really changes the fact that I’m on my way to having (and publishing) an unusually thoughtful take on an important question. If I can keep my eye on that prize, avoid steps that don’t help with it (though not to an extreme, i.e., it’s good for me to have basic contextual knowledge), and keep reframing my arguments until I capture (without
[17:55:36] <Obormot\Arcturus>  overstating) what’s new about what I’m doing, I will create something valuable, both for my own learning and potentially for others’." ... yeah, that'll do it. Just keep reframing those arguments

[23:14:56] <quanticle> It's like either your troops suck, or your entire doctrine was founded on a set of assumptions that turned out not to hold in reality and I'm not sure which interpretation is worse

[23:18:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Anything substantial since the fall of the USSR, even?
[23:19:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Anyway the ironic thing about all of that analysis is that the VDV created modern paratrooper doctrine basically from scratch!

[23:19:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: And what's more, the VDV pioneered paradrops of equipment much heavier than *mechanized infantry*
[23:19:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> They used to paradrop *entire fucking tanks*
[23:19:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> *with people in them*
[23:20:16] <ggreer> seems like if you want to win a war nowadays, you should be sure to have as much of your economy self-contained (or at least dual-sourced) as possible. hell the US can't even make its military uniforms without foreign suppliers
[23:20:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: So my view is that the leadership is *severely* misusing the entire corps ...
[23:21:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: (Which may not, indeed likely is not, the *only* problem, but it's got to be a big problem)
[23:21:18] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: That's what I'm saying. The tanks are like... BMDs and such, whose armor isn't standing up very well to Ukrainian RPG-7s, much less actual anti-tank weapons like NLAWs and such.

[23:22:45] <quanticle> Yeah, I would bet on misuse as well. Like, we keep seeing the VDV do these helicopter assaults.
[23:22:53] <quanticle> As if Ukraine was Vietnam or something
[23:23:25] <quanticle> And it's like, okay, you tried it once against Hostomel on day 1 of the war and it didn't work. So... why do you keep doing it?

[23:34:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> uh
[23:34:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Have we all forgotten that Russia already used to do this
[23:34:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this was stopped due to pressure from Western interests (RIAA primarily, iirc)
[23:35:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does no one remember allofmp3.com??

[23:42:02] <rmmh> starlink is already only 100W
[23:42:23] <rmmh> even less, actually-- like 30W?
[23:44:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> What I remember about the allofmp3 thing is that at the time, Russian copyright law was written with the explicit justification of "the job of the government is to protect the public interest, and it's in the public interest for people to have access to creative works, no matter what foreign countries might say about 'property' or whatever"

[23:46:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (There was a provision that if a copyright holder wanted to be compensated for their music being sold on a Russian site, they'd contact the appropriate Russian state agency and some appropriate amount of money would be disbursed to them, according to how much said state agency decided was the right amount - certainly not just "our music has been downloaded uhh let's say about five trillion times, per day, so we would like
[23:46:13] <Obormot\Arcturus>  eleventy six gajillion dollars please")
[23:47:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But Western lobbying/pressure ended all of that! Even though it was *obviously* the morally correct way to do such things
[23:53:14] <Betawolf> yes, Russian state agencies should always decide what people deserve 
[23:53:53] <Betawolf> if only there was some sort of governing philosophy in which everything is controlled by Russian state agencies...
