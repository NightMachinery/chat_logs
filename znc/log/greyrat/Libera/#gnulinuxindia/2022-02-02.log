[21:04:03] <NeoVoid[m]> didnt you check my pms in irc
[21:04:18] <gtlsgamr> i did that's why i messaged this
[21:04:36] <NeoVoid[m]> what do you think about bridged admin groupthen
[21:05:16] <NeoVoid[m]> just to get in sync the changes we did in each platforms
[21:05:26] <gtlsgamr> but that's what i am saying!
[21:05:34] <gtlsgamr> I won't make any changes here in IRC
[21:05:38] <gtlsgamr> no need for admin bullshit
[21:05:43] <gtlsgamr> let this be a truly "free" group
[21:05:54] <NeoVoid[m]> as you wish
[21:06:44] <AryaK> gtlsgamr: lets have an etherpad or something 
[21:06:49] <AryaK> where you can put ignored irc users
[21:06:56] <AryaK> then neo or me will ban them
[21:08:23] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: then i will remove all the rules and dont do anything about spammers and all
[21:08:36] <NeoVoid[m]> also unbanned all the trollers
[21:08:42] <NeoVoid[m]> how about that
[21:09:03] <NeoVoid[m]> also allow the feature to talk as channels
[21:09:26] <NeoVoid[m]> so you can see glorius matrix telegram bridge talking in itself
[21:09:38] <AryaK> Neo Void: talk in #gnulinuxindia-su:libera.chat 
[21:09:39] <NeoVoid[m]> AryaK: i like that
[21:19:01] <gtlsgamr> nice work NeoVoid[m] 
[21:19:15] <gtlsgamr> freedom shall reign!
[21:19:27] <NeoVoid[m]> i didnt do anything yet
[21:19:39] <NeoVoid[m]> but that freedom come with cost
[21:20:11] <NeoVoid[m]> also if i do that then what will be the meaning of creating this new group
[21:20:33] <NeoVoid[m]> why dont we just go to old @linuxindia group
[21:20:43] <NeoVoid[m]> where spammers strives
[21:21:27] <NeoVoid[m]> just bridge back your irc and matrix stuff back to that group and I'll delete this one.
[21:21:27] <NeoVoid[m]> we'll be good as we were before.
[21:22:12] <AryaK> i hope you are joking 
[21:22:15] <AryaK> and again
[21:22:17] <AryaK> talk in#gnulinuxindia-su
[21:22:52] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m] is on a powertrip today. chill out man!
[21:25:06] <iamak[m]> <iamak[m]> "Someone here said that I shouldn..." <- Anyone?
[21:25:08] <NeoVoid[m]1> AryaK: yeah obviously
[21:25:46] <NeoVoid[m]1> AryaK: sorry for that i receive it late
[21:27:17] <NeoVoid[m]1> iamak[m]: chrome is based on chromium.
[21:27:44] <iamak[m]> Yeah so the UA change won't get detected right? I was asking coz ungoogled chromium removes Google stuff
[21:27:56] <iamak[m]> * Google stuff which might lead to it getting detected
[21:29:09] <NeoVoid[m]1> hmm thats tricky.
[21:29:09] <NeoVoid[m]1> you are asking if you use chrome user agent in ungoogled chromium will that be removed by browser.
[21:29:40] <NeoVoid[m]1> if thats what you asking i say lets try it
[21:30:08] <iamak[m]> I am saying will it be detected by website
[21:30:33] <iamak[m]> Since if it is, I am the only one who uses UG-Chromium with Chrome UA which makes me unique and easy to fingerprint
[21:30:36] <NeoVoid[m]1> yes it should be
[21:31:34] <iamak[m]> How?
[21:42:26] <E-man[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "but that freedom come with cost" <- Freedom always have a price
