[04:48:24] <Me-me> lehinsun: Ms is generally considered a generic term that encompasses married and unmarried women alike - it was invented to be used when one does not know, and tended to be implemented in defiance of the general categorisation of women as married or unmarried. However, there remain people who consider it to have additional connotations, depending of course, on cultural context.

[04:50:36] <lehinsun> Me-me, yeah, thank you. So, if a woman is 50 years old and not married, what should I use?
[04:50:40] <Me-me> In conclusion, it's complicated and there's no one definitively correct answer. Some people find it impolite when you use miss or mrs, even if you use the correct one, and some people find it impolite when you use ms if you know the correct one. If you're asking for a judgement call, I think ms is more likely to be safe than not.
[04:51:02] <lehinsun> yes, agree

[12:53:00] <ludanto> In the sentence "He calls it treason based on his career studying that branch of law." I am unable to tell the grammatical role/function "studying that branch of law" has in the sentence. Is it a participle? Is it describing "he" or "career"?
[12:53:40] <Me-me> It is describing his career.
[12:54:55] <ludanto> Wow, that was quick, ty. So is it a kind of adjective?
[12:55:30] <Me-me> No, adjective refers to the specific word. The term "career studying that branch of law" becomes a "noun phrase".
[12:57:11] <Me-me> I'm afraid I don't recall the specific technical term for what "studying that branch of law" is in this context.
[12:59:43] <ludanto> Well, they could have written just "based on his career" or just "based on his studying that branch of law" and it would be still meaningful/complete sentence.
[13:00:15] <Me-me> That would be "his study of that branch of law" or "him studying that branch of law".
[13:00:41] <Me-me> And yes, they could, but then you wouldn't know what career it was specifically, or you wouldn't know that it was explicitly a career. It's about being descriptive.
[13:02:49] <ludanto> Could it be an apposition?
[13:04:11] <ludanto> bc "carrer" and "studying that branch of law" are almost one and the same thing in this case

[13:21:09] <ludanto> Qualifier sounds good to me :)

[23:07:54] <LjL> you're "getting" passive voice misuse... by who/what?
[23:08:31] <FLHerne> I expect your tool would prefer "In the second quarter <some agency> revised the fall in GDP ..."
[23:08:49] <LjL> in which case your tool is a tool
[23:09:03] <LjL> those grammar checkers are largely worthless
[23:09:03] <FLHerne> but that's a stylistic or content choice, not a grammar problem
[23:09:29] <FLHerne> LjL: things like Grammarly aren't pure grammar checkers anymore, they also do things like this :p
[23:09:31] <LjL> especially if you take them at face value rather than just considering their indications as "hey here's a bit of text you may want to re-read"
[23:09:41] <FLHerne> I actually agree with it in this case
[23:09:45] <LjL> FLHerne, MS Word did this very thing in like 2000
[23:09:55] <LjL> i don't
[23:10:11] <FLHerne> unless it's explained outside the quoted sentences, who /does/ revise GDP?
[23:10:19] <FLHerne> LjL: well, no
[23:10:43] <FLHerne> MS Word in 2000 had a feature that said it would do that, and generated humorous gibberish
[23:10:57] <FLHerne> now they actually give sane advice sometimes
[23:11:03] <LjL> what i mean is that it specifically pointed out any and every sentence with the passive voice
[23:11:09] <rapier> yeah, my tool is grammarly
[23:11:10] <LjL> and recommended that you change it to active
[23:11:18] <FLHerne> Ok, and that's stupid and useless

[23:11:47] <FLHerne> not that it's always right by any means
[23:13:16] <rapier> it's odd... i saw an English version of brazilian news and I thought American ever wrote like this way.

[23:16:04] <rapier> i got it
[23:17:16] <FLHerne> You could leave it in passive voice but explain who did it ("...fall in GDP was revised by <Agency> from..."), or change it to active voice ("...<Agency> revised the fall in GDP from...", or just leave it as-is if it's clear in context

[23:23:06] <FLHerne> but then you should explain them on first use
[23:23:53] <FLHerne> and unless you're using it already, doing so here would completely break up your sentence
[23:24:10] <FLHerne> so honestly you're probably best with what you had originally :-/
[23:24:36] <rapier> right
[23:24:49] <rapier> thank you all of you guys

[23:48:31] <awmv> Is `How does Monday to Friday after 12 pm sound like?` too informal for a mail?
[23:49:01] <furrykef> Not too informal, though I'd remove the "like"

[23:50:33] <awmv> This better? `I can make time from Monday to Friday after 12 pm.`
[23:51:52] <LjL> that doesn't sound great to me
[23:52:09] <furrykef> I like the first version more (without the 'like').
[23:52:17] <LjL> "make time" is an awkward expression to me (i might just not be acquainted with it, though), and it feels like you're generously affording that time
[23:52:47] <awmv> I see
[23:53:07] <LjL> me too, unless you're writing to the queen of england. i mean, i don't know how "formal" an email needs to be, it really depends on the level of formality that particular person expects
[23:53:24] <awmv> `How does anything from Monday to Friday after 12 pm sound?`
[23:54:11] <awmv> I guess I wanted to convey that I'm willing to free up the time after 12 pm 
[23:58:37] <awmv> `Anything from Monday to Friday after 12 pm would work for me.` Are you OK with this?
