[02:00:07] <Bilge> Why does it consume 300GB to delete?
[02:00:19] <Bilge> 300MB*
[02:00:50] <peerce> are you truncating or deleting records ?   deleting has to write all the blocks that have deleted tuples to the wal
[02:01:18] <peerce> stop postgres, move the contents of pg_wal to a separate file system thats more than adequate, then symlink pg_wal to the new place.
[02:01:35] <Bilge> It's a managed service
[02:01:37] <peerce> or even better, mount a dedicated file system in the pg_wal
[02:01:40] <Bilge> Also, it's a dead managed service now

[02:02:42] <Bilge> As far as I know I cannot selectively "truncate" records?
[02:03:11] <peerce> correct, truncate can only delete a whole table as it does a file delete, rather than rewriting blocks with tuples flaged for later vacuuming

[02:12:37] <foo> peerce: thank you. I learned my lesson... never start a project with sqlite. heh

[03:46:12] <foo> ok, I just ran ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN id ADD GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY; and select setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('users', 'id'), max(id)) from users; on everything
[03:46:29] <foo> good thing I only have 15 tables, heh.
[03:50:01] <foo> ok, I think that's it from pgloader - fixed 1 type, fixed 1 FK constraint issue, fixed auto incrementing ids. Anything else anyone can think of to check?

[18:25:32] <robin555> is there any way to make this return 1 row instead of 2? https://dpaste.org/rTxc (also is there a better way to write this in general?)
[18:26:46] <johto> do the second INSERT in a CTE and just make  SELECT convo_id FROM x;  the main query
[18:27:08] <johto> also realize that VALUES is just a special type of SELECT

[22:00:27] <masber> hi, I have a 2 tables like this department(id, name), employee(id, department_id), customer(id, department_id). I would like to list the departments which has more employees than customers. Something like `select d.id, d.name, num_employees, num_customers from department d ... where num_employees > num_customers`. Is it possible to get this with
[22:00:28] <masber> sql?
[22:01:16] *** Quits: hojasuelta (~hojasuelt@fixed-187-188-59-57.totalplay.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:04:59] <masber> or something like this select d.id, d.name, count(e.id <from group1>) "num_employees", count(c.id <from group2>) "num_customers" from department d left join employee e on e.department_id = d.id left join customer c on c.department_id = d.id group by d.id, d.name <group1>, e.id group by d.id, d.name, c.id <group2> having num_employees >
[22:05:00] <masber> num_customers
[22:05:40] <masber> the point is that I make 2 different group by one for department + employee and another for department + customer
[22:06:12] <masber> so I can get the count of employees per department and the group of customer per department and join them in the same row
