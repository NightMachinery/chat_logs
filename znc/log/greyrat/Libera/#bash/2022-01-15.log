[00:41:55] <greycat> !shebang
[00:41:55] <greybot> The top of a script MUST have a #! line, called 'shebang' or 'hashbang'. It tells the kernel what program to run your script with. We recommend `#!/usr/bin/env bash` (why: http://stackoverflow.com/a/733901/58803). http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments#Scripts http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/

[02:47:42] <Blondie101010> so you're basically going over a bunch of files to remove obvious comments?
[02:47:57] <NRK[m]> anyways, think i'll just go with the tmpfile approach.
[02:48:01] <Blondie101010> that doesn't sound like something you should be running often

[02:50:08] <jelly> eh, just use a tmpfile; clone ownership and permissions before replacing the original, if needed

[03:59:07] <tm512> why would I have to assign that in the signal trap, when the signal trap returns execution to the subshell, wouldn't the wait $zanpid in the trap be the last thing that exited?
[03:59:36] <geirha> zanexit=$? from your original script gets the exit status of wait
[03:59:39] <greycat> now there's a subshell involved?  mercy.
[04:01:15] <geirha> the exit status of the wait "$zanpid" outside the trap will be the exit status of zandorum-server if it exits on its own, but since wait is instead interrupted by a signal, it returns 128+signal
[04:02:12] <tm512> greycat: the whole supervise function is launched in a subshell and backgrounded, that way it gets a unique PID that stays constant, and lets me implement stop and restart commands in the script, which send TERM and USR1 to the subshell

[12:19:33] <itu> !cron
[12:19:33] <greybot> Cron is used for scheduling recurring jobs. at(1) is used for scheduling one-time jobs. crontab -e, /etc/crontab or /etc/periodic are places where you can configure jobs. The most common problems with cron jobs include %'s in a crontab (escape with backslash: date +\%Y), commands that rely on $DISPLAY, and having a different environment (eg. PATH/SHELL). See man 5 crontab.

[12:22:16] <marlun> I would like to be able to search for used paths when I'm in the middle of writing a line. Let's say I've written `cp file.ext` and now I would like to find the path ~/work/sub/sub/folder by invoking a command, fuzzy filter a list and press enter to choose a path which will end up on the line I'm writing: cp file.ext ~/work/sub/sub/folder
[12:22:45] <marlun> Is that possible with some tool?
[12:23:12] <pj> !completion
[12:23:12] <greybot> The "elders" in this channel mostly don't use tab completion, so can't help you, but a few of us do, so you may need to wait a while for help. See also !completion2 !completion3 and !completion4
[12:23:22] <pj> heh
[12:23:25] <pj> didn't expect that.
[12:23:30] <pj> !completion2
[12:23:30] <greybot> the completion facility is built-in, but it needs to be told the appropriate details for each command. The *package* called "bash-completion" is a grab-bag of such definitions, of rather varying quality. But you can simply put your own definitions in your .bashrc to override any faulty or missing ones
[12:23:39] <pj> !completion3
[12:23:39] <greybot> Then again, many of us *DO* use tab completion, and some of us have written our own completion functions.
[12:23:46] <pj> !completion4
[12:23:46] <greybot> For additional information about programmable tab-completion, try #bash-completion in OFTC (irc.oftc.net) or see <http://web.archive.org/web/20200809170112/https://debian-administration.org/article/316/An_introduction_to_bash_completion_part_1>
[12:24:05] <pj> marlun: you probably want something with completion.

[15:33:57] <flower_> I'm a newbie and not sure I've even talent for it, but I get things done, which is already something
[15:34:09] <sublim20> that was purely meant to be a joke, and not an insult.  i haven't the code in question
[15:34:18] <sublim20> apologies if its taken that way
[15:34:25] <Earnestly> This isn't exactly poor, all the rules are followed, things are quoted properly, the idea of using functions, etc., etc.

[15:36:05] <jaggz> ttyf is "tty-fake" -- for running programs that want their output to be the tty, not piped
[15:36:41] <jaggz> when I run that,
[15:36:46] <jaggz>                 the newlines come out as literal linefeeds

[15:41:40] <flower_> from line 178
[15:41:45] <Earnestly> It's more that you've already got a file, you spend so much effort wrangling it into variables, arrays, etc. only to print it out again
[15:43:35] <Earnestly> Think about what your functions at the very end are even doing.  init ... wrangle ... filter ... print
[15:43:36] <jaggz> Earnestly, thanks!
[15:43:53] <Earnestly> !script
[15:43:53] <greybot> script(1) allows you to record an interactive session in a terminal. Also, you can use it instead of expect(1) for simple tasks, because it creates a pty.
[15:43:56] <Earnestly> Hm
[15:44:10] <Earnestly> geirha: Is there a factoid about using script to fake a tty?
[15:44:40] <Earnestly> !faketty
[15:44:40] <greybot> Quick way to make programs believe that they're reading/writing from/to a terminal: faketty() { script -qfc "$(printf '%q ' "$@")" /dev/null; }
[15:44:46] <Earnestly> jaggz: There is this too, note %q
[15:45:31] <jaggz> Earnestly, what's that come from?
[15:45:33] <jaggz> note
[15:45:57] <flower_> Earnestly, it's a starting file indeed. But then it check if those apps are installed and if they have 'NSM support' (a audio session api). Then it is possible to print it to console with different amounts of info (name, description, url)
[15:46:19] <Earnestly> jaggz: I'm not sure what you're asking me.  The factoid demonstrates how to use script if you want to use script, but crucial difference is the use of %q and not %s (also /dev/null)
[15:46:37] <flower_> I mean, this file itself, just says which application might have NSM support and might be installed.
[15:46:40] <Earnestly> flower_: That's the filter part, the point is you have inputs, a filter, and outputs
[15:46:41] <jaggz> *Note: that faketty command has the same issue (adding /dev/null, whatever it does, doesn't fix it)
[15:47:18] <Earnestly> The addition of /dev/null just stops it writing typescript files
[15:47:22] <jaggz> so we might want to put unbuffer as an option in that comment?  or does it not work
[15:47:44] <jaggz> $ unbuffer perl -e 'print "Is a term\n" if -t *STDOUT;' | more
[15:47:44] <jaggz> Is a term
[15:47:46] <jaggz> yeah.. works
[15:47:54] <Earnestly> jaggz: No, unbuffer works.  It's not its primary purpose, but the way it is implemented produces this side-effect
[15:48:00] <Earnestly> !unbuffer
[15:48:00] <greybot> stdbuf runs commands with modified buffering operations. man stdbuf(1)
[15:48:26] <Earnestly> stdbuf more or less replaces it for this, but still useful for fake tty
[15:50:12] <jaggz> yeah I have alias s0='stdbuf -o0 -i0'
[15:50:14] <jaggz> :)
[15:50:49] <jaggz> wait does that also make the program think it's ...

[18:16:52] <tercaL> Hi there. I have a file with: "[1012]: NOTICE  [test] Ban 12.34.11.22" lines. Whenever I want to list the "[test] Ban" with grep with; cat /var/log/my.log | grep "[test] Ban", I receive: grep: invalid character range - any idea would be much appreciated.
[18:17:42] <cisco87>  tercaL try \[test\]
[18:17:56] <cisco87>  tercaL try "\[test\] Ban"
[18:18:25] <tercaL> Solved it. Thanks a lot.
[18:18:30] <cisco87> np
[18:19:03] <cisco87> when using stuff that works with regex you need to escape characters that are meaningful in regex
[18:19:18] <cisco87> [] is used create a pattern
[18:19:32] <cisco87> so you need to escape at least all the ones before the last one

[20:40:28] <greybot> xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.

[20:42:24] <jaggz> problem is it kills itself with those commands
[20:42:40] <jaggz> I just looped through the pids, from ps, comparing them to $$, so I don't kill my own self
[20:42:43] <tangy> jaggz: also, using `grep [p]ulseox` can let you drop the `grep -v grep`
[20:42:44] <Soni> (and then eval'ing it ofc :p)

[20:43:09] <tangy> !eval
[20:43:09] <greybot> 'eval' is a common misspelling of 'evil'. If eval is the answer, surely you are asking the wrong question. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/048
[20:43:17] <Blondie101010> jaggz:  pkill does the kill job without killing itself
[20:43:24] <jaggz> tangy, neat
[20:43:53] <Blondie101010> that'd be a really stupid overlook
[20:44:02] <Blondie101010> it'd happen almost on every use
[20:44:08] <Soni> eval is only as dangerous as source
[20:44:42] <rendar> any help?
[20:44:46] <zeraphel> Soni: you don't really need eval,  just match '[[ line =~ cd (.*) #.* ]] && cd "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"'
[20:44:54] <tangy> there should be an emo() builtin
[20:45:00] <Soni> eval() { echo $@ >file; source file }?
[20:46:08] <jaggz> pkill seems to not only be killing this script (I'm not 100% sure of that, it could be dying).  But it's also not finding the "python /path/pulseox.py" or whatever
[20:46:12] <jaggz> it's ok.. got something that works for now

[20:48:39] <jaggz> Blondie101010, that won't work.. need to then specify the pulseox-launcher, and somehow the python thing that's run.. etc. etc.
[20:48:43] <tangy> Soni, source files usually contain text which is executed by `source` as-is. `eval` can execute the output of commands. but okay

[20:59:16] <zeraphel> Soni: I don't really like that about your implementation,  you could achieve more by logging CWD in separate files,  i.e. "${PREFIX:-$HOME}/.session.${session:-default}.cwd".  also no real need in grep. like i've said you can mapfile and iterate in reverse (if you require a multiple CWD's logged)
[20:59:59] <Blondie101010> jaggz:  there's a big discrepancy between what you say and the impression I get from your repo
[21:00:35] <Blondie101010> if you wrote those python scripts, why don't they already have proper service control?
[21:00:58] <Blondie101010> that's like the generic thing to include before it even does its task
[21:02:24] <jaggz> not sure what you're even talking about
[21:03:13] <jaggz> Blondie101010, it was a command line script.. like print("hello world")

[21:03:25] <Blondie101010> when you write anything, the very first thing to think about is "how is it started?" and right after it should be "how is it stopped?"
[21:03:59] <Blondie101010> that is basic service control
[21:04:27] <jaggz> the very first thing was, "can I get this thing to connect to the computer and, without some type of handshake, send data?"
[21:04:37] <Blondie101010> the *normal* approach is to catch SIGTERM and kill the children
[21:04:43] <jaggz> and then it was, "what's that data like.. can I get the vitals from it?"
[21:04:50] <jaggz> etc. etc.

[21:06:15] <Blondie101010> yes

[21:06:25] <Blondie101010> very normalized
[21:06:28] <jaggz> like, could mean "I just want it to run by hand" all the way to "write up systemd junk" ?

[23:22:16] <wenijinew> if the length is stable, then simply - grep -Eo '[[:alnum:]]{32}'
[23:22:58] <uuidNuni1> for json, just use jq . do not use grep/sed/awk/cut
[23:23:27] <wenijinew> yes, sure, jq is better to use.

[23:29:55] <tercaL> thank you both. And if the output is trimmed like; https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kalleboy/f7f4f1c3a74317adf4277377ce01952c/raw/9a64f48ee49f64c924e756198efb519024217fca/gistfile1.txt (no more 'result') how to get the id out of these two lines?
[23:30:35] <uuidNuni1> tercaL:that is not a json
[23:31:23] <uuidNuni1> you can do on your first url : jq -r '.result | .[] | .id , .ip'
[23:33:44] <uuidNuni1> tercaL: well, if you must : curl -s url | cut -d\" -f4
[23:34:10] <uuidNuni1> because that is not a json format , you can't use jq on it
[23:34:16] <tercaL> Hmmm I see..
[23:36:07] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:37:01] <wenijinew> then, suppose you can save it to one file, and then do: cat gistfile1.txt | grep -Eo '[[:alnum:]]{32}', or you can even use: cat gistfile1.txt | grep -Eo '[[:alnum:]]{3,}'
[23:37:44] <wenijinew> so, if not json, then 'grep -Eo' can do you favor.

[23:40:16] <wenijinew> by using grep, you can extract substring in most cases, you don't even need to use cut, and big waste to use sed. just be faimilar with regular expressions with grep. very powerful and easy to use.

[23:44:24] <uuidNuni1> lol. agreed, awk is more suitable to process fields. sed is too heavy
