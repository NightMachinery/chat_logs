[06:04:26] <Roey> Joanna: so in applying for FISMA auditing jobs,
[06:04:44] <Roey> I'm just..riding this carousal of interviews
[06:04:47] <Roey> and then let-downs
[06:05:10] <Roey> I have a -stellar- resume.
[06:05:14] <Roey> 18 years of auditing.
[06:05:29] <Roey> I thought I'd get a job within two weeks of quitting my previous one
[06:05:34] <Roey> that's now three months ago.
[06:18:57] *** Quits: tangy (~tangy@user/tangy) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:24:53] <trench> so your resume is not perfect
[06:25:00] <trench> you need to change it each time
[06:26:48] <Roey> I mean, I apply to the same stuff that's in my resume
[06:27:31] <jan6> use comic sans and dingbats, liberally
[06:27:38] <Roey> But I see what you mean, since I'm getting pegged by recruiters who want me for opsec / sec engineering / architecture / stuff like that that I have good experience in but am just not interested in
[06:27:42] <Roey> jan6: :)
[06:30:29] <Joanna> I’m not sure how everything is after the past two years of hysteria
[06:30:53] <Joanna> When it comes to getting new jobs
[06:31:34] <Joanna> Roey: what made you quit previous job?
[06:32:59] <Roey> so I had been at my place for 15 years and then it got bought by an international company whose policies were different, the people were different, etc.  I went with no raises for almost three years before I realized I was earning less than I had been earning ten years ago, due to inflation.
[06:33:55] <Roey> that, plus other fuckery - I had brought them a good-sized contract, was told I'd get a commission, only to be told later that I wouldn't be getting one
[06:34:23] <jan6> oof
[06:34:31] <Roey> and also the nature of the auditing changed
[06:34:58] <Roey> from Federal clients, with whom I feel very comfortable auditing, to like.. sports betting companies
[06:35:12] <Roey> I just lost interest as soon as the Federal stuff dried up
[06:35:40] <jan6> make your own company? ;P
[06:35:49] <Roey> with the help of money, sure
[06:36:12] <Roey> ya need nest egg money for that
[06:36:20] <Roey> I've been burning my FU money for three months
[06:36:31] <jan6> also money to live yourself, while it's getting off the ground
[06:36:38] <Roey> see, that's exactly it
[06:36:57] <Roey> need six months of a salary, plus more money to invest in the company / other workers
[06:37:18] <Roey> I can make an LLC 
[06:37:19] <Roey> too
[06:37:21] *** Quits: TonyStone (~TonyStone@cpe-74-76-51-197.nycap.res.rr.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:37:26] <Roey> and start getting bit contracts here and there
[06:37:30] <Roey> SBIRs even
[06:37:40] <Roey> so I considered that...
[06:37:52] <Roey> I'm not entrepreneurial about it though.
[06:37:56] <jan6> depends on other people, you cooould start off more friend-based, and agree to start off with low, if any, pay, till you can actually make any profits
[06:37:59] <Roey> again this is my job but not my calling
[06:38:03] <jan6> @ investing
[06:38:07] <Roey> ah true 
[06:38:09] <Roey> very true
[06:39:01] *** Quits: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio) (Quit: like flours and complements)
[06:39:20] <Roey> it's funny, ya know, when they think you're a flight risk, they start loading your schedule so that you have no free time to look around for another job
[06:39:33] <jan6> lol, that's kinda stupid of them
[06:39:42] <jan6> because to me, that'd be all the MORE motivation to quit
[06:39:49] <Roey> ikr
[06:40:03] <Roey> it's a pattern I picked up on only after I left
[06:40:07] <Roey> in hindsight
[06:40:16] <jan6> always hindsight
[06:40:23] <Roey> sigh yeah
[06:40:24] <jan6> never now-sight
[06:40:37] <Roey> see, I just want a strip of $20M.
[06:40:39] <Roey> to me.
[06:40:46] <Roey> and that's that.
[06:41:12] <jan6> I jus want you to send half of your money to me, because I'm jan6 and you're not, all hail jan6 ;P
[06:41:20] <Roey> :))))))))))))))))
[06:43:03] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)
[06:45:20] <jan6> I long for the future where making money isn't an inherent need, be it through UBI or any other means, but it's always for what you can't have, lol
[06:45:48] <Roey> :)
[06:46:39] <jan6> one where sitting in bed and surfing the web all day is possible, while also being able to live non-trash food, and stuff like that ;P
[06:46:40] <jan6> lol
[06:46:45] <Roey> haahha
[06:46:52] <jan6> *eat
[06:46:55] <Roey> actually regarding the food, I'm getting very very good about that
[06:47:13] <jan6> good at making? good about choosing?
[06:47:26] <Roey> low-fat whole-plant-based, zero oil, nothing processed (like fake meat/fake cheese/store-bought breads, etc.)
[06:47:54] <Roey> good at choosing to eat the food that I have made for myself instead of going and getting vegan chinese food because it's tasty and convenient
[06:48:01] <jan6> that sounds like a lot of extra pain for little to no benefit, but I guess you do you
[06:48:12] <Roey> (but again, loaded with oil and processed fake meats)
[06:48:27] <Roey> also lifting weights, I'm doing that consistently now
[06:48:35] <Roey> and also walking on my treadmill desk
[06:49:53] <jan6> but also, making SOMETHING edible is usually really easy and not inconvenient, but making something COOL, can take considerable time and effort, for example I did DIY potato chips, frying on a pan, and was surprised at how much effort that required, but hey, it was good enough result to do it anyway
[06:50:39] <jan6> (obviously it was rather oil-heavy proccess, but at least not deep frying, lol, the pan itself was actually rather dry, most of the time)
[06:50:48] <Roey> hah yeah
[06:50:49] <Roey> true
[06:51:07] <Roey> like for example... I batch-cook entrees in my Instant Pot and stash them in the freezer
[06:51:13] <Roey> that's easy to make a lot at a time
[06:51:17] <Roey> then there is other stuff like salsa
[06:51:24] <Roey> I can make it but
[06:51:30] <Roey> hrm maybe I should just freeze that too
[06:51:38] <jan6> sure, you can batch a lot of stuff, too
[06:51:38] <Roey> it comes in handy over tortillas
[06:51:41] <Roey> yeah
[06:52:14] <Roey> so like I always have two types of entries in the freezer, parceled into Gladware "Soups and Salads"-sized containers
[06:52:30] <jan6> although I personally don't like freezing that much, normal fridge is good enough, and freezing can make stuff...less good...partially because of all the breaking of cells and whatnot
[06:52:31] <Roey> now it's lentil stew, and chickpea stew
[06:52:43] <Roey> oh ok
[06:52:51] <Roey> I don't perceive a difference, but anyway,
[06:53:24] <Roey> so I take half of a container of that, add to it a starch from the fridge like brown basmati rice/ rice noodles / potatoes, microwave all that together, then chop myself up a salad quickly
[06:53:26] <Roey> and that's my lunch
[06:54:03] <Roey> it prevents me (ostensibly) from buying restaurant food / Uber Eats
[06:58:13] <jan6> well, a lot of restaurant and other pre-prepared food has extra sugars and stuff, to make it more tasty and more likely you want to come back
[06:58:39] <jan6> so good at that
[06:59:06] <jan6> also, especially if you batch-do stuff, and microwave, it's probably also a lot more efficient, and cheaper, also
[06:59:21] <Roey> aye
[06:59:23] <jan6> also also, very easy to customize and mix it up ;P
[06:59:25] <Roey> yeah I don't use the oven much
[06:59:39] <Roey> and cooking on the stove top.. not often
[06:59:43] <Roey> other than noodles 
[06:59:56] <Roey> but that's just noodles and water, heh
[07:00:57] <jan6> tbh we don't even have an "oven" nor a microwave, lol (we do have heating through wood furnace-fireplace thingy tho, which can be used for food, but y'know, no temperature selection)
[07:01:15] <jan6> and takeout's very much a rarity, also
[07:01:27] <Roey> ahhhh
[07:01:32] <Roey> oh! my time's up, gotta run to bed :)
[07:01:36] <Roey> have a good night jan6 :)
[07:01:44] <Roey> and thanks for the lovely discussion :)
