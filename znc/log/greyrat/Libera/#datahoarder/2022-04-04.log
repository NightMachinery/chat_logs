[00:57:05] <evilgohan2> > Weezer released a couple of albums titled Weezer, sometimes twice a year.

[00:57:30] <evilgohan2> The way that managing tags and media player compatibility for Weezer albums annoys the absolute hell out of me...
[00:58:17] <joepie91> lol
[00:58:28] <joepie91> this is why we can't have nice things
[01:01:13] <evilgohan2> lol Weezer has like 6 or 7 self-titled albums. Jokingly, people used to refer to them by color except that got thrown off because Vinyl releases started coming in multiple colors.
[01:01:30] <evilgohan2> i.e.

[01:02:06] <Sensiva> Hello everyone, Does anyone know an free open source energy monitoring solution that works on Linux? Basically pulls energy readings from generic energy meters and log those readings in a database for processing.
[01:02:08] <evilgohan2> then there's green, red, white, teal, black
[01:02:13] <evilgohan2> except, don't confuse the Black Album from Weezer
[01:02:19] <evilgohan2> for the Black Album from Metallica
[01:02:26] <evilgohan2> or the actual "Black Album" from Jay-Z
[01:03:06] <evilgohan2> or the Black Album from Prince.
[01:03:13] <unfinity> ・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\_​ø< q​uack!

[01:03:15] <unfinity> Well this is awkward, the duck needs to think about it. You can try again in 7 seconds.
[01:03:20] <Hydragyrum> ,bang
[01:03:20] <unfinity> Hydragyrum you shot a duck in 7.565 seconds! You have killed 29 ducks in #datahoarder.
[01:03:21] <evilgohan2> ,bang
[01:03:22] <unfinity> There is no duck! What are you shooting at?
[01:03:23] <evilgohan2> oof
[01:03:31] <ThePendulum> why is prince any less actually black than jay z?
[01:03:52] <ThePendulum> also god damn Ice T is 64
[01:04:03] <evilgohan2> I fail to understand the inquiry as presented.
[01:04:16] <ThePendulum> why is the actual black album from jay-z
[01:04:48] <evilgohan2> because that's just what it's called lol

[14:32:12] <auctus> i had no idea a NAS could do all this shit that isnt ... well, storage.
[14:32:23] <auctus> ive never looked at one of these NAS interfaces before, this is quite a lot of stuff.
[14:33:27] <breavyn> well they are just a computer
[14:34:26] <auctus> yeah but i thought youd have to kind of DIY to get any of that functionality
[14:38:49] <auctus> can i do root stuff? Can i run totally arbitrary stuff on a QNAP NAS without having to flash my own OS or boot some external drive?
[14:39:09] <Snuupy> qnap stuff tends to not have proper support etc
[14:39:12] <Snuupy> software support
[14:39:48] <Snuupy> prob gunna be left on an old kernel without updates
[14:40:35] <Snuupy> I'm still waiting for a proper rpi cm4 nas
[14:40:35] <auctus> having never seen this before, and having not bought any drives yet (i have a probably faulty one in there just to test it), i thought id poke around at it before putting my own OS on
[14:40:42] <Snuupy> like the pibox 5 bay
[14:40:55] <auctus> x86 is way more fun
[14:41:03] <Snuupy> $$$$
[14:41:40] <auctus> its not a huge percentage of the total cost is it?
[14:42:15] <Snuupy> it's really the x86 nas cases that are expensive
[14:42:45] <auctus> pi compute module carrier boards arent that super cheap
[14:42:49] <Snuupy> they're $100
[14:42:57] <auctus> for the carrier?
[14:43:04] <Snuupy> yes
[14:43:23] <Snuupy> $75 for the cm4
[14:43:28] <Snuupy> or 85 whatever
[14:43:30] <auctus> so $100 carrier, plus case, plus power supply, plus the compute module
[14:43:44] <Snuupy> 3d printed case, so $20 or so
[14:43:51] <Snuupy> see: pibox 2 bay
[14:44:59] <auctus> i dont think overall a pi compute module and carrier board are at all reasonable for a low cost piece of electronics
[14:45:13] <auctus> like, as a manufacturer or end-user trying to get something for a few hundred bucks
[14:45:20] <auctus> of some niche hardware like a homebrew NAS thing
[14:45:49] <NeoThermic> depends on the QNAP as to how arbitrary you can do things on it; I know QNAP locks a lot of things down (and/or lies about things :D )
[14:45:57] <NeoThermic> but from memory you can just run linux on most of them
[14:46:14] <auctus> makes more sense for more expensive stuff, i keep shopping about for that kind of thing for other projects not NAS related
[14:46:48] <auctus> i hate talking to sales people, its like 2 dozen emails and calls and different agents to figure anything out
[14:46:56] <Snuupy> https://slickdeals.net/f/15707989-costco-tp-link-deco-axe5300-tr-band-mesh-wifi-6e-system-3-pack-349-99 this excites me
[14:46:59] <auctus> for e.g. carrier board stuff, or whatever
[14:47:00] <Snuupy> finally cheap wifi 6e
[14:47:29] <Snuupy> but gigabit backhaul? wat
[14:48:02] <NeoThermic> yeah, gigabit backhaul is still the default because consumer 2.5 isn't much a thing yet
[14:48:54] <NeoThermic> I know unifi are coming out with a 6E that has 2.5 backhaul, but the rest of their 6E stuff is GbE
[14:52:28] <NeoThermic> and I get their perspective; 2022 phones, tablets and laptops are going to default come with 6E, but home consumer ISP routers/networking stuff is still in GbE land, so why spend more today on something that ~98% of the market can't use?
[14:53:00] <NeoThermic> plus, can't upsell you the 2.5GbE version later once 2.5 takes off in the home space ;)
[14:56:02] <NeoThermic> there's like one UK ISP that has a 2.5 port on their provided router, and that's only with their Gig1 service
