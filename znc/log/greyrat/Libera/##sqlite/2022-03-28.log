[05:57:18] <TheDcoder> Hi, I am new to using databases. I was wondering how I could store time tracking data in a table?
[05:58:21] <TheDcoder> I have a list of projects and I want to store how many hours I worked on each project per day, a project may not necessarily have logged hours every day.
[05:58:39] <TheDcoder> Any suggestions for the table structure that I should use for this kind of thing?
[06:28:00] <Xgc> TheDcoder: First decide what you want to store, what kinds of queries you might like to execute, and what results they will produce.
[06:30:11] <TheDcoder> Hi Xgc, I have already mentioned what I'd like to store. For query, I'd like to be able to retrieve the number of hours for a project on a given date range
[06:30:54] <TheDcoder> I guess the thing which is throwing me off is how can I store this data
[06:31:41] <TheDcoder> Should I just make a table with a text column for each date?
[06:32:25] <TheDcoder> I see that SQLite has some useful date functions, maybe I can use an integer instead of store the date as an unix timestamp for each day
[06:32:28] <Xgc> TheDcoder: Use a projects table, to hold the valid projects, if you think you want that.  Then store some log table, with a date, duration, project_id.  Insert as many rows as you wish for any days, hours, projects...
[06:33:21] <TheDcoder> Right, that makes sense. What format should I use for the date?
[06:33:44] <TheDcoder> Should I go with integer because it's easier to compute?
[06:35:17] <Xgc> TheDcoder: https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html   ...   I would try to stick with a date type for that, even though sqlite doesn't exactly have a date type.
[06:35:46] <TheDcoder> I have gone through the page, that's how I got to know about the date functions :)
[06:37:29] <TheDcoder> Alright, INTEGER looks like the best choice here
[06:38:08] <TheDcoder> I could've used the Julian dates but it uses floating points and that's more complex to compute
[06:40:25] <TheDcoder> Another question, I want to make my database a little more organized by adding "tasks" to each project, so I'll have a "tasks" table with corresponding projects. To make querying more efficient, can I tell SQLite to index the project_id column as well?
[06:40:35] <TheDcoder> Should I worry about optimization at all?

[16:26:13] <arkanoid> if a writer process terminates badly and leaves sqlite+wal+shm sidecard files, but the process was not writing when the event happened. Can I just open the sqlite db or is better to perform additional check before doing so?
[16:27:28] <Habbie> just opening should be fine
[16:39:17] *** Joins: emanuele6 (~emanuele6@user/emanuele6)
[16:46:06] <arkanoid> Habbie: thanks
[16:50:17] <arkanoid> I've to deal with a bad design. The writer shares the db via dropbox like service (not my decision). On the other side I've to read it (if it is safe to do so), dump the contents into a postgres instance, and truncate the table into sqlite. My question is when is safe to do so. I have to assure that it's safe to read
[16:51:29] <arkanoid> I'm using a combination of file system events and pragma integrity_check, but unsure if there's more I can do to improve this unlucky situation

[19:12:51] <exarkun> arkanoid: https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#walformat has no fields that are obviously about associating it with a particular database
[19:15:34] <arkanoid> exarkun: thanks
[19:15:52] <arkanoid> that's sad
[19:29:54] <Chunky_Ks> arkanoid: fundamentally, it's impossible, with sqlite and a dropbox-like-service, to make the absolute guarantees that you need for this to be guaranteed to work
