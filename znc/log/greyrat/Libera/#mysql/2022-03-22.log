[18:59:00] <Xgc> VaniaPy: I know this is a little off-topic.  What prevents you from persisting a java object in the database?
[18:59:31] <Xgc> VaniaPy: It's not an uncommon thing to do, and it should be system (and database) agnostic.
[19:00:48] <VaniaPy> Xgc well,i have created the mvc model and i have an Entity (Passenger). When i'm trying to persist the object i'm getting the error "table 'passenger' doesn't exist"
[19:01:49] <Xgc> VaniaPy: Well, that just means your SQL (or corresponding jdbc logic)  is wrong.
[19:02:33] <Xgc> VaniaPy: It's probably a simple mistake.
[19:03:24] <Xgc> Hard to diagnose without know exactly what prompted the error.
[19:03:58] <Xgc> Could be a simple connection issue, wrong default database, etc.
[19:04:52] <Xgc> or even a spelling mistake, if your table names (in that context) are case sensitive.
[19:05:39] <VaniaPy> hmm, maybe a jdbc error

[20:28:35] <renihs> Mmike: a common cause for that can be a network equipment (e.g firewall) that terminates the "idle" tcp connection
[20:28:51] <renihs> maybe the successfull runs were from different networks/different rules etc
[20:29:37] <Mmike> renihs, unlikely - I'd expect it to behave the same for both connections then...
[20:29:47] <Mmike> I can't get to the server so I don't know what the logs there say
[20:31:11] <renihs> they probably will also only say lost connection, can easily be a network error as said or timeout hitting on firewalls (but that would always be on the same time)
[20:34:25] <Mmike> renihs, if it was a network issue, wouldn't both mysql cli sessions die at the same time?
[20:36:27] <renihs> no, necessary, sometimes not even all connections need to be affected :)
[20:36:34] <renihs> i know a firewall that sometimes nukes some but not others :)
