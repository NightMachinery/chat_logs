[23:49:40] <emanuele6> 2021-10-27 08:23:29     user51  good day. does anyone have a copy of henry spencer's asl? (awk syntax language)
[23:49:44] <emanuele6> finally :)
[23:49:52] <user51> took me a while
[23:50:07] <user51> i did check my logs but at the time i quit because the site had an incomplete archive
[23:52:25] <user51> i did it again this time but noticed that the lawker domain linked to google code. so i finally found some common sense and thought hey, lets check the google code.
[23:56:08] <user51> emanuele6: oh, and :)
