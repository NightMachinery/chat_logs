[15:56:21] <taeaad> *not letting go
[15:56:58] <huf> there's this one trick to maintaining shit codebases where you're never going to have the time/resources to fix it

[15:58:34] <huf> but that's just a bit of fun to keep you motivated
[15:58:49] * mst likes generating input/output logs from a sample of production traffic, then I can replace the legacy component with code that I know has the same quirks except now I can *see* the fucking quirks
[15:58:53] <Altreus> making shit codebases less shit is enjoyable until it meets the part where you have to figure out what it's expected to actually do
[15:59:03] <huf> :D
[15:59:07] <huf> yeah i dont like that part
[15:59:09] <mst> Altreus: ^^ see my last comment for letting it tell me
[15:59:13] <Altreus> The "is this a bug or a feature?" conundrum crops up far too often
[15:59:19] <huf> Altreus: usually you can just assume that whatever it's doing is good
[15:59:25] <huf> and just add your crap on top :D
[16:00:02] <Altreus> Well then it becomes fun trying to find a suitably exhaustive data set that would actually make the bugs obvious
[16:00:25] <Altreus> I've had to enshittify code before simply to reïntroduce a bug that I couldn't figure out how to implement on purpose
[16:00:43] <taeaad> Well, I specifically checked today how long the Greek mathematics era was, and it seems like it was from 7th century BC to 4th century A.D., which gives 950 years to 1300 years depending how you define it, and surely we should be thinking in those kind of time frames.
[16:00:43] <Altreus> luckily you can put that in a sort of sin bin and delete it later
[16:02:47] <mst> Altreus: like I say, I extract the data set by instrumentation
[16:03:34] <mst> taeaad: ah, but you see, software suffers from entropy in a way maths doesn't, hence why on a long enough timeline in a computer system parallel lines -will- meet
[16:03:57] <mst> then again, before I switched from maths to computing, I quite liked non-euclidean geometry :D
[16:06:44] <huf> huh, managed to fix the tests again without understanding them :D
[16:06:53] <huf> red bad, green good
[16:06:59] <taeaad> mst: I think it's true that software ages, but it's also true that newer things are more likely to die off more quickly.
[16:07:01] <huf> this is an industry for deep thinking :D
[16:07:29] <taeaad> I wanted to learn Haskell a while ago and instead I just read older code now, and it's more interesting to me.

[16:11:30] <mst> taeaad: number theory was my favourite playground but I didn't stick around long enough after undergrad to really feel like it counted as "working on"
[16:12:12] <taeaad> I work mostly in set theory, but I've found some potential connections to number theory that I'll be investigating for a while.
[16:12:14] <mst> I did get a shout out in a paper for -spotting- the result that a proper mathematician then proved but that's about the limit of my claim to fame there
[16:13:18] <taeaad> Mathe is mostly griding work with spiritic bouts of creativity. So the occational spotting of things is pretty much the way new work evolves, so it's pretty important.
[16:13:22] <Altreus> how does one "extract the data set by instrumentation"?
[16:13:26] <Altreus> This sounds like black magic
[16:13:37] <taeaad> *spirited
[16:14:07] <huf> Altreus: you look at where the crap is flowing into the river and make a copy
[16:14:16] <huf> so you can make the same crap flow down the river twice
[16:14:36] <huf> this is particularly simple since bad codebases generally peck and gather data at random points
[16:14:44] <taeaad> huf: Sounds awefully classical. Assuming you can copy or do things twice :)
[16:15:21] <mst> taeaad: of, I was very pleased to have spotted it. I'm just very conscious that I couldn't've written the proof.
[16:15:49] <mst> taeaad: my ego is quite sufficiently healthy to be smug about the former -and- honest about the latter :D
[16:16:10] <mst> Altreus: a generalisation of "log arguments and return values"
[16:16:30] <mst> there's a certain amount of black magic involved in making a shitty codebase do that, sure, but that's the fun part
[16:17:28] <Altreus> so a sort of constrained fuzz test
[16:17:52] <mst> right, and then lots of tests are that

[16:18:42] <mst> well, yes, that's why I log what they *get* for a week or two first
[16:18:49] <Altreus> mind you, if the first run crashes with "no such method" then you can at least search for what has that method

[17:38:08] <pragma-> Regarding the fun maintaining large code bases, this is one of the cases where Perl's Tim Toady can bite Perl in the ass. Since there's so many ways to do things, and Perl freely and happily encourages you to find your own style, many Perl code bases look nothing like each other and people develop very strong personal opinions about syntax...
[17:38:47] <pragma-> Then you have all these "competing" event loop frameworks and OOP frameworks, etc... 
[17:39:36] <pragma-> My head spun so much while reading about POE and IO::Async that I just rolled my own instead. :p
[17:39:38] <mst> my experience is that most code I come across is either basically raw OO or M* of some sort
[17:40:38] <pragma-> Yeah, I guess there's slightly more diversity with event loop frameworks than OOP frameworks.
[17:41:05] <pragma-> Though there are quite a few M's
[17:41:13] <pragma-> Moose, Moo, Mouse at the very least.
[17:41:15] <mst> Moose/Moo/Mojo aren't *that* different
[17:41:38] <mst> Mouse is not something I've ever seen in a lib/ tree happily
[17:41:43] <mst> and would get deleted very rapidly if I ever did
[17:41:51] <mst> since it's not compatible with anything else
[17:41:57] <pragma-> Yeah, after you spend a few hours reading about them you realize they aren't that different and then you wonder why there are so many if they aren't that different. :p
[17:42:19] <pragma-> Lighter and faster!
[17:42:37] <pragma-> Though I have never seen anything like POE before :p
[17:42:38] <ilmari> mojo is the most different, in that it only has untyped, lazy, rw attributes
[17:42:55] <mst> Moose was the original. Moo is a meta-free pure perl lightweight version. Mouse was somebody's exercise to learn how Moose worked to contribute to the codebase and they abandoned it as soon as they could work on Moose. Mojo is a minimalist system designed specifically for the stateful parts of your apps
[17:43:42] <mst> one of the reasons Moo exists was people kept thinking Mouse was something that was designed for people to actually use, and I decided to write a proper answer to the problem they had that was leading them to that mistake
[17:44:03] <pragma-> There's a lot of reading and ecosystem stuff to figure out when you're trying to choose which frameworks to use
[17:44:17] <mst> IME that's true of everything though

[20:17:38] <Altreus> my favourite thing about genio's example is how there is no possible way to be sure that $new_var = ['something here',] is the first time $new_var was actually set
[20:19:02] <Juerd> mst: Yes, and they're pretty strict by default. Accessing an array (read: hash) by a nonexistent index (read: key) emits a warning.

[20:20:40] <Juerd> OTOH it's just as annoying as comparing undef eq "foo".

[20:21:31] <genio> ERROR - 2021-07-30 15:26:50 --> Severity: Warning --> count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable
[20:21:42] <genio> Then you go and look at what's going on and find that nonsense
[20:22:11] <gordonfish> Is that PHP?
[20:22:25] <Altreus> An empty array is false in PHP anyway so you don't need to count() it
[20:22:45] <Altreus> if ($misspelled_variable_name) { bug_you_never_find() }
[20:23:11] <thrig> in theory coverage tests would indicate bug_you_never_find was not reached?
[20:23:19] <gordonfish> That error seems to be from a call to count() though
[20:23:41] <genio> gordonfish: yea, see my example up there of my complaints of this PHP
[20:23:48] <gordonfish> Ok
[20:23:58] <Altreus> thrig: tests?
[20:24:05] <genio> it's just... _why_?
[20:24:18] <gordonfish> genio: Ah, gah, what did I just read

[21:18:26] <Altreus> I've written code... I feel like programming is a more noble engagement than this
[21:19:03] <Altreus> I've copied some scripts and modules, removed the majority of what they do, and I am now running the test and seeing what is broken
[21:28:21] <shlomif> Altreus: ah, heh
[21:28:40] <Altreus> it is now 6pm and I turn into a pumpkin at half past
[21:29:01] <huf> programming is like knowing how to build/maintain/run steam locomotives back when that was the sexy new thing
[21:29:12] <huf> this aint academia boys
[21:29:36] <huf> in a hundred years, we'll be as well paid and prominent as the people who run our trains are now :)
[21:31:00] <Altreus> But Perl programmers will be as revered as actual steam locomotive drivers are now
[21:31:16] <huf> we'll run a little museum perl shop somewhere in wales
[21:31:31] <huf> show them how to fix the same old bug every day

[21:31:40] <Altreus> you can try your own regexes
[21:31:58] <huf> Altreus: but the keyboard at the regex machine is a bit broken of course
[21:32:14] <Altreus> I just used a full stop instead of a semicolon
[21:32:17] <huf> you can see that it could've been fun but now it's pointless :D
