[05:49:17] <Stanley> Is there anything better than Brew on OSX for managing packages
[05:49:27] <Stanley> I swear every time I try to do anything it breaks PHP and I spend hours trying to fix it
[05:50:02] <Byteflux> for package management in general, maybe not... but really should look into simply virtualizing or containerizing your development
[05:50:03] <__adrian> do you mean the "on OSX" part too?
[05:50:21] <__adrian> .__.
[05:50:56] <Stanley> it's a nightmare man
[05:51:04] <Byteflux> even though Docker on macOS is virtualized rather than proper containers, it's better than relying on brew (or any other distro package management system)
[05:51:30] <Stanley> I've had tons of headaches with Docker too, which makes it sound like it's just me
[05:51:35] <Stanley> and it might be, but still
[05:51:59] <__adrian> re: docker: if you're not using the most recent version you should be
[05:52:17] <Byteflux> could be just you, but maybe not because Docker doesn't run natively in macOS, still at this point with how prevalent macOS is for development... I'd be surprised if it wasn't easy to work with by now.
[05:53:02] <__adrian> older osx implementations (particularly around the filesystem) were reallybad

[05:56:19] <Byteflux> I don't think Valet requires 7.2, it's just what the docs have as an example to show that it can manage multiple PHP versions using the '@version' syntax
[05:56:24] <Stanley> so -tried- to switch to PHP7.2 temporarily and now instead of one broken project i have a broken environment that breaks everythinggggg

[05:57:15] <Byteflux> right, it'd do all the brew stuff for you behind the scenes

[06:00:38] <Stanley> __adrian well we already knew some people were monsters, nice to confirm it

[06:02:04] <Stanley> hard to convince myself with the job market being an incentive*
[06:02:08] <Byteflux> Well, if you deploy production applications to Linux servers, I think you can also quickly recognize and appreciate the benefit of Docker once you learn it
[06:03:01] <Stanley> I use Laravel Forge which has been pretty solid for me, I try to avoid the server side because i'm a shitadmin
[06:03:19] <Stanley> the knowledge a single individual needs to have to do everything on their own is insane
[06:03:50] <Byteflux> Sure, you have to compromise in some way if you want to excel in another. Can't know everything.
[06:04:54] <Byteflux> FWIW, Laravel development is moving towards Docker
[06:05:00] <Stanley> web development? alright, html, css, javascript, know a few database engines, serverside languages. source control? gotta learn git. Oh, you need to host it somewhere? learn sysadmin inside out and backwards so you don't have a vulnerability and get hacked. Ohhh you need a cloud storage provider? Alright, theres this thing called amazon S3, but you'll need to spend a while learning permissions voer there
[06:05:19] <Byteflux> The docs now recommends Sail as the recommended way to develop Laravel apps
[06:06:18] <Stanley> it's hard to keep up with their preferences
[06:06:38] <Stanley> seems like Sail is probably going to stick around, but Valet isn't that old either
[06:07:46] <Stanley> i'll give the sail docs a read through though
[06:07:52] <Stanley> probably a good introduction to docker I would guess
[06:08:19] <Stanley> in the meantime I have to deploy some changes to prod before I go to bed in 4 hours and i don't have a working development environment
[06:08:40] <Byteflux> Do you recognize what the problem line is in the valet/brew log you pasted?
[06:08:46] <Byteflux> The one that's stopping PHP from installing.
[06:09:09] <Byteflux> I see it, I think. You should be able to google it to see if others have had the same experience / a solution exists.
[06:09:25] <Stanley> I think it's dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/tidy-html5/lib/libtidy.5.dylib
[06:09:37] <Byteflux> Yep
[06:09:48] <Byteflux> This problem needs to be resolved and then you can try again.
[06:09:52] <Byteflux> You might turn up some results if you google
[06:10:07] <Byteflux> Maybe not results exactly for libtidy, but similar situations.
[06:11:03] <Byteflux> Googling "homebrew dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/tidy-html5/lib/libtidy.5.dylib" seems to yield promising results.
[06:12:00] <Stanley> it recommended running brew update and trying to re-install but it's still failing, but that was a post about 7.4

[06:36:13] <Stanley> oh man now Forge won't let me deploy
[06:36:20] <Stanley> one thing after another today :(
[07:03:58] <__adrian> in general, i don't want to limit a return type to "array." my first thought is to hint  iterable  as it leaves the choice of implementation open. but in practice, not knowing gets annoying... yes, you know you can foreach() it, but you don't know if you can use array_*(), ->current(), etc. without inspection.
[07:04:23] <__adrian> i think  Generator  is going to be my new go-to... thoughts?
[07:05:09] <Byteflux> this is one of PHP's major design flaws that needs to be addressed in some future major version... "array" functions should just be iterator functions
[07:05:25] <__adrian> agreed
[07:06:12] <__adrian> i wouldn't call it a flaw, really, considering that arrays were basically the "iterator" type for a hell of a long time
[07:06:16] *** Joins: Poboy (~Poboy@user/poboy)
[07:09:14] <Byteflux> not sure how declaring it a Generator is much better tho
[07:10:07] <Byteflux> unless you're talking about returning a generator that yields from an array
[07:10:14] <__adrian> you could
[07:10:39] <__adrian> but mainly, when i want to return "not an array" it's usually for reasons that are solved with a generator
[07:11:44] <Byteflux> yeah, but even so, if you did just return a generator is probably still makes sense to encapsulate the return as an Iterator
[07:11:49] <__adrian> and in many cases, if the caller "needs" an array, they can turn it into one (with a little bit of caution) easily enough
[07:12:06] <Byteflux> since a Generator is a type of Iterator
[07:12:23] <Byteflux> I would consider the fact that you're returning a Generator to be an implementation detail, and it makes sense to expose it as an Iterator
[07:12:24] <__adrian> curious why that would be better (if that's what you mean) than hinting  iterable
[07:12:54] <__adrian> (also from that point of view, Iterator is an implementation detail of Traversable)
[07:13:21] <__adrian> (I don't often do plain iterators, but when i do it's often IteratorAggregate)
[07:13:24] <Byteflux> yeah im conflating iterable and Iterator
[07:13:30] <Byteflux> but yes hint it as an interable, definitely
[07:13:43] <Byteflux> iterable*
[07:13:51] <__adrian> thing is... i've actually tried that. and it's turned out to be limiting.
[07:14:45] <__adrian> the main app i work on has its own iterators, collections, etc., and i had some methods that i needed to implement as generators ("who-knows-how-many-records" situation)
[07:15:13] <__adrian> i used iterable. and it turns out to mean, I'm only allowed to foreach().
[07:15:32] <__adrian> no other functionality.
[07:15:44] <Byteflux> if 'iterable' is insufficient then I would go back to saying 'Iterator' is more appropriate than 'Generator' because the less details you have to expose, the better. Like, what implementation details of Generator is actually worth exposing? :P
[07:16:28] <__adrian> well, in most cases, not much.
[07:16:52] <__adrian> send() and throw(), which i love the idea of, but have yet to have code complex enough to need them
[07:17:55] <__adrian> and if i go back as far as Traversable, i'm limiting myself to foreach() again, as Iterator and IteratorAggregate share nothing

[07:29:12] <__adrian> OH

[07:29:58] <__adrian> false means "no more properties"

[07:35:09] <__adrian> clarification: they _are not_ iterable (the type hint); i mean they shouldn't be something you can iterate.

[07:35:50] <Byteflux> right, they shouldn't be considered a data structure similar to arrays.
[07:38:09] <Byteflux> but back to the original question, unless you come across a use case where those Generator-specific methods are useful, you make it easier on yourself to limit exposure to Iterator or `iterable` (if even the Iterator methods aren't that useful)
[07:38:57] <__adrian> opposite problem
[07:39:14] <__adrian> if i want to include Iterator, then i want to include IteratorAggregate
[07:39:22] <__adrian> which means Traversable or iterable
[07:39:37] <__adrian> which means i have the same problem of "NO, only foreach"
[07:39:40] <Byteflux> how come? You can return an Iterator from a IteratorAggregate
[07:39:53] * __adrian thinks
[07:40:33] <__adrian> so this is not my current problem, so not as thought out
[07:40:43] <__adrian> but consider a "Collection" class of some sort
[07:40:55] <Byteflux> yes, something PHP sorely needs lol
[07:41:06] <__adrian> it's not _just_ the values. it's functionality, like filter, sort, map, etc.
[07:41:24] <Byteflux> yep yep, there are actually "collection" libraries out there for that exact purpose, too
[07:41:40] <__adrian> this is not something i'd implement as an iterator, but as an iteratoraggregate
[07:42:15] <__adrian> so in that case, i'd actually _want_ to be able to return the aggregate (as opposed to saying, "well, get the iterator then")
[07:42:19] <Byteflux> just so I understand do you have an example where this distinction becomes problematic?
[07:42:31] <Byteflux> like a pseudocode sample
[07:42:35] <__adrian> but also the iterable an iteratoraggregate returns ...doesn't _have_ to be an iterator  :)
[07:43:38] <__adrian> example: not really: the issue is that i'd want to return the entire object (with its functionality), not _just_ the part that can be an Iterator
[07:44:12] <__adrian> so if i have to "back up" the interface list that far, it's the same as using the psuedotype, and i again "know nothing" except that i can foreach it
[07:44:24] <Byteflux> but you're saying that `class Collection implements IteratorAggregate` ?
[07:44:57] <Byteflux> and you'd want to be able to `return $collection` ?
[07:44:58] <__adrian> right, i'm saying that including that at all means i basically might as well allow arrays too.
[07:45:33] <__adrian> i'm saying i can't have both, and i think i'd rather have the knowledge (and default to being more specific, Generator).
[07:45:55] <__adrian> because if i default the other way, i don't have anything.
[07:46:23] <__adrian> now, as an _argument_ (input) type hint, yes, 100%  `iterable` unless i need something specific
[07:46:41] *** Joins: undefined_bob (~undefined@user/undefined-bob/x-5411918)
[07:46:44] <Byteflux> what does being specific and declaring it as Generator actually get you over Iterator or `iterable` tho, in your specific example?
[07:47:09] <Byteflux> Of course a Generator still has the same issue as not allowing IteratorAggregate
[07:47:20] <__adrian> over `Iterator`: not much, that could be fine, i just don't use Iterator much/at all so it's not compelling.
[07:47:29] <__adrian> over `iterable`: i know what the value is
[07:47:38] <__adrian> i can do more than just blindly foreach() it.
[07:48:07] <__adrian> i know i can use the methods, and not the array functions, and i don;t have to further inspect it.
[07:48:08] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[07:48:39] <__adrian> being specific in the `array` directions would also give me this knowledge, but is the more limiting implementation.
[07:48:50] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[07:48:53] <__adrian> hi
[07:49:21] <Byteflux> But it seems like the Generator choice doesn't provide any practical advantage over Iterator when weighed against the IteratorAggregate argument
[07:49:35] <__adrian> sure, i'll concede that
[07:49:44] <__adrian> (i just don't like Iterator)
[07:49:59] <__adrian> the advantage is over `iterable`/`Traversable`
[07:50:11] <Byteflux> Personally, I think that *if* Generator's specific methods had any practical use, it makes a stronger case... but absent that I think it makes sense to be as generic as possible.
[07:50:21] <Byteflux> That puts you at Iterator
[07:50:27] <__adrian> it would.
[07:51:36] <Byteflux> The other advantage of Iterator is that you don't always have to return a Generator :)
[07:52:03] <__adrian> thank you Captain  :p
[07:52:12] <Rockwood> Byteflux, what kind of generator topic is today?
[07:52:14] <Byteflux> Whereas by declaring it Generator, you force yourself into always returning a Generator :P
[07:52:54] <__adrian> yeah, that's admittedly my prefernce showing through
[07:53:18] <__adrian> Iterator is a PITA to implement and IteratorAggregate/Generators are incredibly easy
[07:53:38] <Byteflux> The built-in SPL iterators takes a lot of that pain away though
[07:53:56] <__adrian> ...some of them do
[07:54:33] <__adrian> the ones you can "just use" do. but they're not that great as bases for building your own on ime
[07:54:47] <__adrian> at least, not once generators showed up.
[07:55:14] <Byteflux> I guess always returning generators isn't as painful as I thought though. `yield from` works on any Traversable object... for some reason I thought it was just arrays.

[07:55:49] <Byteflux> hear me out...
[07:56:01] <Byteflux> declare Iterator return type, but always return Generator with `yield from` :D
[07:56:04] <__adrian> if you say "union type" ...
[07:57:32] <__adrian> :)
[07:57:42] <Byteflux> But Generator seems okay. I doubt exposing send/throw methods will throw a wrench anywhere
[07:59:35] <__adrian> while we were talking i wrote a ->map() method that means i no longer need to decide on a return hint

[21:40:14] <impliednude> I am neither getting any output when I run the script or errors or anything. https://3v4l.org/p2P5T
[21:42:19] <AllenJB> impliednude: Do you actually call sendOrderToNS? (You don't in the posted version of your script)
[21:43:02] <Byteflux> impliednude: curl_exec() returns the response output (since you have CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER) but you aren't capturing it.
[21:43:15] <biberu> that's an odd way to generate the nonce
[21:43:43] <AllenJB> FYI there's a library for NetSuite's API: https://packagist.org/packages/ryanwinchester/netsuite-php (altho it uses the SOAP API rather than the REST version)
[21:44:18] <biberu> you can use e.g. php.net/random_bytes to get some random data, it'll have much more entropy
[21:46:17] <impliednude> AllenJB> ughhh. Thanks for catching that.
[21:48:44] <impliednude> god I am tired. . AllenJB> sadly it is SLOWWWWW. also, it uses the SOAP system and you can't call a restlet via it
[21:50:13] <impliednude> the system I am using I have been using that for using internal stuff. but I need something thats a bit faster and simplified and allows me to bypass the need to call required fields for stuff like creating a basic SO
[21:52:01] *** Joins: Cyberg33k (~Cybergeek@91.216.101.170)
[21:52:18] <AllenJB> impliednude: Does their REST API give faster responses for the same content then?
[21:53:50] <impliednude> AllenJB> much faster.
[21:55:18] <impliednude> the rest api also allows to create restlets that can deviate from the standard response
[21:56:04] <impliednude> aka for an example I can create a restlet that ignores required fields but still allows you to create stuff
[21:56:52] <impliednude> or query
[21:57:22] <AllenJB> Ta, Might look into that if I find the time - or one of my coworkers who does more with NetSuite might be interested in that. We've been switching to NetSuite at my work this year, and finance want it to be a "single source of truth". Thankfully everything I've done with it so far hasn't been speed sensitive.
[21:59:00] <impliednude> We have multiple 3rd party apps that access netsuite -sighs-

[22:12:38] <AllenJB> HTTP 410 is "Gone" - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/410 - exactly what that means in NetSuite terms I have no idea. Have you checked the response body to see if it has more detail?
