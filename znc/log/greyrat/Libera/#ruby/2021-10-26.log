[02:17:27] <dviola> I'm trying to keep the JWT.decode separate from the rest of the code: https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/79c348f2cf1e4396cfcaaf8876752dbf#file-app-rb-L7-L13
[02:17:33] <dviola> and not exactly sure how to refactor it
[02:17:51] <dviola> would appreciate some advice
[02:18:24] <dviola> it's some roda code
[02:18:48] <adam12> dviola: Lots of ways.
[02:18:59] <dviola> I don't want to do the jwt decode every time I call a route
[02:19:00] *** Joins: motherr (~motherr@user/motherr)
[02:19:06] <dviola> adam12: oh, hmm
[02:19:12] <adam12> dviola: Outside of route block, you can just define a regular method. That's available inside the route block.
[02:19:33] <dviola> adam12: oh
[02:19:36] <adam12> dviola: I'd just call it at the top of the routing tree.
[02:19:53] <adam12> dviola: auth_token = ...; JWT.decode ...;
[02:20:01] <adam12> dviola: That is, if every route is authenticated.
[02:20:02] <dviola> adam12: oh! that's cool
[02:20:15] <dviola> thanks
[02:20:25] <adam12> You can use the error plugin to catch JWT::DecodeError, and then render your message there in one place.
[02:21:05] <adam12> plugin :error_handler do |ex; case ex; when JWT::DecodeError; response.redirect("unauthorized", 401);
[02:22:23] <adam12> Gotta run. bbiaf.

[03:34:50] <adam12> cuppajoeman: Something is seriously wrong there...
[03:35:32] <cuppajoeman> adam12: Yes, I realized that - I ended up going to ruby 2.7 following this random guide I stumbled across https://flyingcakes85.github.io/blog/jekyll/2021/05/24/jekyll-webricks-issue.html
[03:35:36] <random-jellyfish> is there some gem that can help me find the main div on a webpage, for example in a news article I want to automatically extract the text of the article and ignore other text like title, navbar, menus, adds, etc. ?
[03:35:38] <cuppajoeman> Which somehow solved my issue
[03:35:41] *** Joins: postmodern (~postmoder@user/postmodern)
[03:36:36] <adam12> random-jellyfish: Nothing automatic AFAIK. You could use nokogiri or Oga and just work through some known selectors for main elements.
[03:37:10] <adam12> cuppajoeman: Not even the TypeError is concerning; you have a segfault too. Glad you got it working on 2.7 tho.
[03:37:40] <adam12> random-jellyfish: You'd need some sort of ML maybe. I saw a library for Python not too long ago.
[03:37:58] <cuppajoeman> the weird thing is that I'm sure I followed two diff install instructions to a tee (arch linux one and then jekyll) one both with same result
[03:38:47] <random-jellyfish> adam12 do you remember the name of the python lib?

[17:06:29] <nakilon> guys, to generate simple static html pages from markdown -- would you chose kramdown or pandoc-ruby?
[17:07:20] <adam12> Pandoc is definitely more flexible, but it's another dependency.
[17:08:18] <adam12> If you're only generating HTML, I'd just use kramdown. But I might try to build a markdown adapter that you can swap for pandoc if necessary.
[17:08:36] <nakilon> looks like kramdown was made after pandoc according to the first section here https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html

[23:50:46] <cAMP> I was looking at Jeremy Evans Roda introduction. It says Roda applications are "meant to be frozen." What does a frozen application imply? Is it a process inside which the ruby interpreter is frozen?
[23:55:10] <adam12> cAMP: Frozen means that mutable objects are "frozen". I quote frozen because nothing in Ruby is truly frozen.
[23:56:08] <adam12> cAMP: So, let's say Roda maintains plugins inside an Array. Adding a plugin mutates that Array. But you don't want to mutate that Array when handling a request, as it might be a sign of something unsafe, so you call `freeze` after booting your app, and now that Array will raise a FrozenError if it's mutated, showing you that you might have an
[23:56:08] <adam12> unsafe operation somewhere.
[23:56:32] <adam12> cAMP: This generally means that when booting your Roda app, the call inside your config.ru would look something like `run App.freeze.app`
