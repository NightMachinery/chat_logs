[01:01:29] <fmstrat> Hey all, about to use ZFS for a mirrored array for CCTV footage in AVI format. Any thoughts on compression?
[01:02:07] <xMopx> avi is a container format iirc so compression may or may not be useful
[01:02:17] <fmstrat> Hrm, good point
[01:02:32] <fmstrat> It's from RTSP streams from Wyze cams
[01:02:52] <sarnold> it's almost always useful to turn on at least lz4 though, it costs very little and might be able to spot some redundancy in large runs of video..
[01:03:02] <xMopx> ^
[01:03:14] <xMopx> you could also try saving a sample to a file and using command-line variants of the same compression methods to test
[01:03:33] <fmstrat> sarnold: Oh fair point
[01:03:37] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。。 ​ ・゜゜\_ø<​ FLAP​ FLAP!
[01:03:40] <sarnold> ,bef
[01:03:41] <unfinity> The duck said no, maybe bribe it with some pizza? Ducks love pizza don't they? You can try again in 7 seconds.
[01:03:48] <sarnold> ,bef
[01:03:49] <unfinity> sarnold you befriended a duck in 11.554 seconds! You have made friends with 125 ducks in #datahoarder.
[01:03:49] <fmstrat> It's a container for ITU H.264 video and A-Law audio it appears, so likely already compressed
[01:04:10] <fmstrat> But the dedup would be helpful since a lot of similar frames
[01:04:17] <fmstrat> (I think)
[01:05:30] <sarnold> or perhaps regular re-framing in the container or something
[01:06:53] *** Joins: x_kuru_ (~xkuru@user/xkuru)
[01:08:09] <xMopx> that makes sense for keyframes, but i dont have the info to know if it would
[01:08:59] <sarnold> yeah, me neither :( it feels plausible to me that it might find *something*, and it ought to be pretty cheap whether or not it does

[19:33:02] <skye0> about the football thing, is it soccer or handegg? i was wondering if those stats apply to the US or the world

[20:07:34] <evilgohan2> handegg was always the dumbest term to me. I'm not a fan of the sport, but it doesn't look remotely like an egg.

[20:15:09] <xMopx> footballers play so hard they get life changing brain damage, soccer players fake injury when they're Losing
[20:16:10] <xMopx> i want to see a game, not a drama
[20:16:14] <xMopx> that's where i stand on the issue
[20:18:12] <sarnold> twenty minutes of sport sprinkled throughout three hours of commercials
[20:20:40] <xMopx> time to converse and share stories with the boys :)
[20:21:01] <xMopx> much rather have that than be glued to a sport with few stops
[20:23:01] <skye0> xMopx true. Plus, I like the locality of certain sports because world football kinda become obnoxious IMO. kind of promotes a masculinity i'm not exactly a fan of, even without violence motivated by the sport (that happens to be the case in Europe quite often)

[20:23:27] <skye0> ayy
[20:23:51] <skye0> plus, since i'm not too deeply into sports, i might not mind the commercials in non-association football
[20:23:53] <xMopx> unlike soccer there arent any football stadiums built by slaves either, which is nice
[20:24:48] <skye0> meanwhile i'll just be twiddling my thumbs and probably be shooting hoops if i were so inclined
[20:28:17] <skye0> i want to play one or two games but they require me to be drunk to have the most fun with them or something. am a bit house bound though so can't really order booze without parents asking me funny questions

[22:40:42] <Codaraxis_> I'm not entirely sure how on topic this is, but it seems like the right place to ask: Are there any solutions recommended for selectively copying content off a central server to a local system and keeping said content in sync with the origin?
[22:40:44] <Codaraxis_> In my head, I liken this to checking out content from a library for local viewing.
[22:40:47] <Codaraxis_> More specifically, I have a central storage site with my full collection. I would like to be able to select specific directories and/or files that I want to be copied locally, maintaining a specific hierarchy and staying in sync with any potential upstream changes. However, I would not want downstream changes to affect upstream ones. Thinking about it, it would effectively be setting up a local cache.
[22:40:49] <Codaraxis_> Currently, I'm thinking of using SyncThing with receive-only directories and/or ignore lists that act as white lists.
