[01:04:27] <cliluw> When I use a server-side cursor to run a query, when is the query actually run? Is it run up front when I do the DECLARE?
[01:05:56] <StuckMojo> no
[01:06:28] <StuckMojo> not until you execute it, and even then, potentially only the part you've asked for is run
[01:06:33] <jo-so> The hstore type provides an operation to calculate the set difference (`EXCEPT`) of two records. Is there something similiar for jsonb? The best I've got is `select to_jsonb(select * from jsonb_each('{"a":1, "b":2}'::jsonb) except select * from jsonb_each('{"a":1}'::jsonb));`, but I don't know how to convert it back to jsonb.
[01:07:29] <cliluw> StuckMojo: Thanks.
[01:07:54] <jo-so> I want to use this to calculate the difference (the changed values) between OLD and NEW in a trigger.
[01:08:08] <cliluw> One more question, where can I go to read up on server-side cursors? I read the docs on https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-declare.html and it wasn't very useful.

[01:40:35] <ash_worksi> velix: okay, so firstly, how do you deal with this scenario: say you have a migration where you `DROP some_table ...; CREATE some_other_table` ... *if* you migrate this to production as is, you'll need to run a script to give privileges at the same time right?
[01:40:45] <StuckMojo> cliluw: re: that email question: to my uderstanding, if possible, execution is actually stopped on the server side between fetches. i.e. it only gathers what you ask for, if it can. if you've done something that requires the whole result set to be sorted after being fetched, then clearly it can't
[01:40:57] <StuckMojo> the result is not generated over an over though

[01:41:30] <StuckMojo> cliluw: the answers you seek are difinitively in the source code
[01:41:59] <StuckMojo> there's probably a big block comment above the function that starts up execution of a cursor
[01:42:34] <StuckMojo> cliluw: people really don't use them anymore, that's why you can't find much about them. they are an artifact of the 1970s
[01:43:11] * ash_worksi used cursors like a year ago 
[01:43:14] <ash_worksi> (not for any practical reason)
[01:43:17] <StuckMojo> or maybe even 80s, but were pretty much dead by the turn of the century because client memory amounts became large enough to make them obsolete

[01:46:38] <ash_worksi> I mean... maybe there's not a terrific way to handle this other than have the app redirect to "temporarily unavailable" until you complete the migration
[01:47:28] <StuckMojo> cliluw: also, to my knowledge, plpgsql cursors are regular cursors under the hood, so most of what you read here implicitly tells you about regular cursors: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/plpgsql-cursors.html

[03:13:41] <Sammitch> is it possible/advisable to use pg_upgrade to go from 10 straight to 14?
[03:14:20] <johto> no reason not to, as far as I know
[03:15:20] <maciek_> Sammitch, yes/yes. We just did that in prod a few days ago and it went great. You should probably review release notes of the intervening major releases, but it should just work.
[03:17:20] <Sammitch> phew, thx. thankfully we've got a few test clusters/envs to run through the mill before throwing prod under the bus

[16:33:51] <Berge> â€¦unless that hits OS buffers, though
[16:33:53] <ne2k> Berge, those writes were fairly small (a few tens of MB) so figured that could be the cache lying about the real speed

[16:38:06] <ufk> i want to get unique calls from X to Y that wheren't created from specific router configuration (pt_id) and to see i have future calls with same numbers that did happen from that router configuration
[16:38:14] <ne2k> ufk, and can you put a sample schema and some sample data in dbfiddle.uk for experimentation?
[16:38:36] <ne2k> just describe it first, though
[16:38:45] <ufk> sure

[16:39:57] <Berge> ah, how many devices in the RAID?
[16:40:13] <ufk> 3 devices
[16:40:16] <Berge> I would expect _much_ faster reads from a RAID of NVMe. Like several orders of magnitude faster.
[16:40:27] <ne2k> ufk, is there just the one table here, mc_cdr?
[16:40:43] <ufk> it's on production and it has quite a load so i'm guessing that's part of it

[16:41:10] <ufk> yeah
[16:41:33] <ufk> sec.. i tried to add setup_time rules maybe it will filter it more quickly.. let me check it's explain

[16:42:26] <ufk> nope.. made it slower :)
[16:42:50] <ufk> ok so mc_cdr contains calls
[16:42:56] <ne2k> you seem to have source_id, setup_time, caller_number, clear_number, call_id, direction, pt_id
[16:43:21] <ufk> if i create one index that contains all of these columns it may speed things up ?
[16:43:38] <ufk> i'll continue explaining
[16:44:08] <ufk> so each call is a unique call_id, each call can have 1 to 8 rows, the first row has direction=1 and the rest of direction=2 per call_id
[16:45:04] <ufk> i want to find distinct caller_number->clear_number that wheren't connected to specific source_Id and pt_id  that i mentioned in the query.. which means that didn't connect through a specific router that i have.
[16:45:35] <ufk> then i want to find out future calls, that contain any of the unique caller_number,clear_number combinations that where connected through that specific router
[16:45:39] *** cation21 is now known as cation
[16:45:40] <ne2k> so if calls have a unique call_id and the table can have 8 rows for a call, the table doesn't contain "calls", per se, does it?
[16:45:58] <ne2k> i.e. call_id is not a key for this table
[16:46:05] <ufk> it contains all the routing of each call you are correct
[16:46:12] <ufk> each call can have more then one row
[16:46:43] <ne2k> how is it determined how many rows it will have, and how do you know where the source/pt in question are? could they be in any of the rows?

[16:48:10] <ne2k> I wonder whether your subselects for your exists and not exists are searching the full thing, not just the last sixty minutes. is that as it should be? or is that perhaps causing some inefficiency?
[16:48:24] <ufk> i work with 2 companies who deliver calls... source_id 1 and source_id 2, each one of them has specific router (pt_id) that i want to check against. so in general i want to get the amount of unique caller_number,clear_number that wheren't connect through that router, and then the amount of calls that happenned after the original calls that where connected through the router, grouped by the source_id
[16:48:53] <ufk> ne2k that's what i thought! ohhh
[16:49:29] <ufk> interesting.. let me see if it changes something
[16:49:49] <ne2k> if you only care about the last sixty minutes, you could do with t1 as (select * from t where setup_time>now() - interval '60 minutes') and go from there, I've done that before
[16:50:25] <ne2k> I also wonder whether you might aggregate those rows per callId and search on the aggregate value. not sure if that's a good idea or not

[19:15:46] <Myon> newer PostgreSQL versions can inline the CTE expression, so it will be fast
[19:16:04] <spicylobster> Myon, i meant a query that uses `array_length` like `select * from my_table where array_length(some_column, 1) > 1;`
[19:16:06] <Myon> EXPLAIN will show what it's doing, the slow case would be "CTE Scan"

[23:52:51] <concrete-houses> so If I have a mainuser    and I want to create an admin role    I could do 'create role admin in role mainuser'  so admin inherits the privs from maniuser   then I could do 'create role login password 'applepie' in role admin'

[23:54:45] <maret> For example I have a large list of user transactions and I have to do a recursion through data to find additional one then I do some processing on application layer, but amount of data is so large that it taking a lot of memory. So I was thinking about splitting into smaller parts saving them once they are processed and then serve them from db
[23:54:48] <concrete-houses> does that sound right?
[23:55:25] <concrete-houses> I wonder why work has another role aside from mainuser  and grants all this stuff to that
[23:57:20] <concrete-houses>  sobel: if I alter default privs, does that stop the defaut bahvior of an object owner from owning the new object?  or just add the new grants to objects created? in addition to creaor having all privs?
[23:58:38] <sobel> concrete-houses: good question. what does the documentation say about that?
[23:59:41] <Profpatsch> maret: My guess is that it really depends on how your data is laid out in the database
[23:59:48] <Profpatsch> Maybe you can work with cursors?
