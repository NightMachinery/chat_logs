[03:49:49] <apotheon> (which is a volatile oxidizing gas that, on contact with water, also has the lovely property of producing a highly corrosive acid)
[03:49:53] <nomagno> the company that makes it names it nowadays, unfortunately
[03:49:56] <duuude> why do people name stuff without water, water?

[03:50:23] <duuude> good to know about two dry waters
[03:51:04] <apotheon> Of course, actual dry water (silica nanoparticle coated water droplets) does have water in it.
[03:51:28] <apotheon> Neither oxygen difluoride nor Novec 649/1230 contains any water, apparently.
[03:51:42] <duuude> the only thing that deserves to be dry water is liquid cabon dioxyde

[03:52:17] <PlanckWalk> Yes, but solid carbon dioxide is called dry ice
[03:52:26] <apotheon> The term "ice" is not particular to water.

[03:52:45] <apotheon> The term "ice" is still not particular to water.
[03:53:00] <PlanckWalk> It is, in common usage
[03:53:00] <nomagno> liquid CO2 is not insanely safe, don't suggest giving it a fancy name
[03:53:19] <apotheon> PlanckWalk: I beg to differ, given the very obvious example of dry ice.
[03:53:28] <PlanckWalk> :-/
[03:53:35] <duuude> neither should be "water" be particular to ice then.
[03:53:48] <apotheon> Water is not particular to ice.
[03:54:05] <nomagno> CO2 is probably the simplest fire extinguisher you can use
[03:54:11] <apotheon> It's particular to one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms in a single molecule.
[03:54:20] <PlanckWalk> Evidently not
[03:54:31] <nomagno> Water is the name for H2O
[03:54:53] <nomagno> H2O is the chemical formula of water
[03:55:25] <apotheon> PlanckWalk: You say that, and yet some guy on YouTube is inventing a namespace clash with something known as "dry water" for a long time that actually involves H20 coated with a hydrophobic substance.

[05:08:04] <CoderGuy> using javascript i'm looking to reverse loop through a string and grab each word seperated by a deliminator. The problem is if you do substring(index,sameindex); it returns nothing. The second index has to be greater than the first, And you can't set i to the location of the deliminator because than lastIndexOf will return the same location everytime. So what happens is "A;B;C" i gets set to the index of B, the deliminator is at the semi colon 
[05:08:04] <CoderGuy> substring(delim + 1,i) returns nothing
[05:08:24] <CoderGuy> so i'm doing substring(delim + 1, i + 1); just curious is that standard?
[05:08:35] <PlanckWalk> Why not use split?
[05:08:43] <PlanckWalk> Justthe allocation it does?

[05:13:38] <CoderGuy> so what happens is, i is being set to the index location of the deliminator minus 1, but then on the substring part we find the new deliminator index & if that index + 1 is equal to i, it doesn't work so i'm doing i + 1
[05:14:09] <CoderGuy> and i'm just curious if this is logical or if there is a different approach to this, cuz this does work but it's weird looking
[05:14:36] <CoderGuy> also I think in C# they just do the length you want on a substring which avoids this problem

[05:15:28] <CoderGuy> oh well it could be like abc;def;g;hij;k;lmnop;

[05:19:11] <CoderGuy> I guess the real question is when grabbing a word from the end of a string based on a location what is proper because (lastIndexOf(delim,startindex) + 1) could be equal to the startindex
[05:19:16] *** Joins: kerberos (~jezavala@189-213-142-248.static.axtel.net)
[05:20:14] <CoderGuy> so because it could be equal to the start index, do you do like lastIndexOf(delim,startindex - 1) so that when you do delimindex + 1 it's still underneath the startindex, or do you just accept this problem and do substring(delimindex + 1,startindex + 1);

[05:21:40] <CoderGuy> For example AB;C;D   Lets say you start at Index C, so 3   it will find the semi colon at 2 so 2 + 1 is 3. You started at 3, substring(3,3) is nothing. you have to do substring(3,4)

[05:23:47] <CoderGuy> that sounds like "we will split everything, then we will reverse through the array"
[05:24:05] <EdFletcher> then filter
[05:24:09] <EdFletcher> or reduce
[05:24:12] <CoderGuy> but my goal is to not spend the extra resource by reversing through it & filtering during the loop
[05:24:12] <EdFletcher> to pick what you want
[05:24:23] <EdFletcher> "spend the extra resource"?
[05:24:24] <georgy> why reduce if filter can do it

[05:24:46] <CoderGuy> yeah the extra resource of forming the array, why not during the form the array step filter it & why not instead of looping forward, loop backward so we don't have to reverse

[05:27:05] <EdFletcher> yup absolutely right georgy, and because of that you should just use the best APIs to solve the problem at hand and let the runtime authors worry about opimtizations

[05:34:43] <CoderGuy> cuz if you start at index 3, find the seperator at index 2, you want everything from the seperator + 1 to your starting point, which is the same as the seperator + 1 soooo unless your string char grabber is fine with grab from (whereyoustart) just grab one thing
[05:34:58] <PlanckWalk> Anyway, if you're determined to do it this way then you just keep around a variable holding the last delimiter location (and start it at end of string)

[05:36:40] <PlanckWalk> Also don't use lastIndexOf or whatever

[08:23:24] <kveroneau> Well, I can already say that I am a complete fan of the syntax of SmallTalk nor LISP.  Personally, I prefer a language which is self-documenting, where you can read code without comments and should be-able to understand what's going on, and what the program is trying to do with as little external documentation as possible.

[08:26:48] <ProfSimm> kveroneau, assembly is lucky in that it's a fixed set of instructions and that's it

[08:29:03] <ProfSimm> kveroneau, extensibility as in the ability to define/replace instructions or implementing DSL-s for specific areas of your code
[08:29:24] <ProfSimm> In assembler subroutines are just jumping around the code.
[08:29:30] <ProfSimm> Doesn't scale well

[08:30:53] <kveroneau> Ruby doesn't make me happy.

[08:31:38] * kveroneau looks at watch.
[08:31:50] <kveroneau> Looks like it is getting late.  I should be going as well.
[08:32:47] <kveroneau> ProfSimm, good luck with your language implementation.  Look forward to hearing more about it.
[08:33:05] <ProfSimm> In short I'll just say what I'm trying to do is this: 1) Take LISP, but remove the excessive parens and replace them with significant newlines and indenting 2) Have a default function acting as an interpreter of an expression 3) the default interpreter works like smalltalk in that you pass positional/named params to a function/object, it returns another function/object forming a method 
[08:33:05] <ProfSimm> chain 3) you can replace the default intepreter to have DSL-s, like you can have some section be SQL without the strings, but as a native part of your program in the AST
[08:33:16] <ProfSimm> kveroneau thanks
[08:33:17] <ProfSimm> see ya

[10:20:23] <apotheon> Not everything good from Smalltalk ended up in Ruby, but if you identify the most Rubyish things that Ruby got from Smalltalk, and remove them from Smalltalk, suddenly Smalltalk would be a much less interesting language.

[12:52:57] <decker> liscensing has nothing to say about reproducing ; it is a little more hazy if you had a non-complete clause
[12:53:11] <mrig> merijn there are different types of minds, some are simply not focused upon that sort of thing.
[12:53:24] <merijn> mrig: The main issue is that in most of the world (certainly the US and Europe) any work you do during your job belongs to your employer. So if you make an edit to "your" library during working hours, you cannot publically release/license it, since part of that library is now copyrighted by your employer
[12:53:28] <decker> when I started work after 2000, I already had my library and it was already public liscensed, so they couldn't do much to keep that

[12:54:05] <merijn> decker: I'd still get it in writing that any work you do on it during working hours can be open sourced under the same license, tbh
[12:54:08] <mrig> oh it is human nature.
[12:54:19] <decker> ya
[12:54:30] <mrig> it is model able, and there is math behind it.
[12:54:34] <merijn> I'm in the luxury position that my current job licenses everything Apache 2.0 unless otherwise specified, so I don't have to worry too much :>

[12:55:11] <merijn> So at worst I need to drop a copyright line that specifies it's partially covered by my job in whatever personal project
[12:55:18] <mrig> merijn so if you change your job are you supposed to forget all that you have learned in your time working for that person?
[12:55:55] <mrig> Do they own your experience? It does lead to an odd situation.
[12:56:21] <merijn> mrig: They can't own your experience and what you learned, so the answer to that question is an unambiguous "no"
[12:56:36] <mrig> merijn yes this is what this guy has done to resolve the issue in current work.
[12:56:53] <mrig> so if you rewrite the same lib, it is not a copy>
[12:56:54] <mrig> ?
[12:56:57] <merijn> Like, these questions aren't hypothetical philosophical ones. It's pretty explicitly and well-defined what is covered and what not by the law where you are
[12:57:20] <mrig> It is usually a great practice for improving the code, to rewrite it I suppose.
[12:57:27] <merijn> mrig: Depends how different the implementation looks from the original. If they look identical you'll have to somehow convinced a judge it's not a copy if/when you get sued
[12:58:21] <mrig> yes like the poorly paid game dev can do battle with a company that has as much money and Harvey Weinstiens as Hollywood :D
[12:58:35] <mrig> Curious situation.
[12:59:20] <alycidyne> merijn: wait, I'm wondering if I understood correctly. If you work on your project during working hours and it has a license you chose, your code still belongs to your employer then?
[12:59:40] <merijn> alycidyne: The code you wrote during working hours is owned by your employer, yes
[13:00:07] <merijn> alycidyne: You cannot decide to license code owned by your employer differently without their permission
[13:00:17] <mrig> Oh well I just found the thought to be an interesting one, it had not really occurd to me and I am very much one who will go out of their way to avoid reading small print, like most people in this world. 
[13:00:27] <alycidyne> merijn: right, it's the licensing I was wondering about
[13:00:33] <merijn> alycidyne: So if you library is GPL you can no longer distribute, since the part you wrote under working hours is proprietary and owned by the company
[13:00:51] <merijn> alycidyne: Unless you get your employer to agree to license "their" code under GPL too
[13:01:13] <merijn> alycidyne: It's actually worse, in many states in the US companies will claim to own code you write *outside* of working hours too

[13:01:52] <mrig> Very cool to hear his take on the language standards and how C was used over the years too.
[13:02:26] <merijn> alycidyne: A license is just a method for the owner of a copyright to give some rights to someone else. But you cannot give away rights you don't own (because they're your employers' rights to give away or not)
[13:02:40] <alycidyne> merijn: I know, but that last one is seriously f-ed up
[13:02:47] <mrig> I bet that the people who used the language in this way are or were not the ones writing problematic code.
[13:02:50] <merijn> Agreed

[13:11:53] <DnzAtWrk> are camera software developers incompetent?
[13:12:03] <DnzAtWrk> Or is there some magical reason they decide to always let the camera go out of focus and stay there forever

[13:13:29] <DnzAtWrk> there are well defined formulas for that

[13:15:19] *** Joins: jazzy (~jaziz@user/jaziz)
[13:15:25] <mrig> if you are using low lighting, and very wide aperture your depth of field will be far less, and it will always be harder to track a sharp edge; Just set it up once manually and forget.
[13:15:26] <DnzAtWrk> for example, use a sobel filter on an image
[13:15:27] <flakland> then the next problem will be when autofocus can't tell which spot is less lburry
[13:15:30] <DnzAtWrk> the more edges, the sharper it is

[13:18:57] <DnzAtWrk> either way, cameras are quite lousy in the way they scan the focus range too
[13:19:18] <DnzAtWrk> when it has a sharp image, it should't need to defocus entirely and scan the new range
[13:19:26] <DnzAtWrk> just search locally
[13:19:40] <DnzAtWrk> but instead, you have a perfectly good image, and it just defocuses entirely over and over
[13:20:04] <mrig> DnzAtWrk search locally requires also knowing what the subject is.
[13:20:10] <mobidrop> camera programmers are notoriously lazy
[13:20:24] <mrig> manual setup is seriously underrated.
[13:20:56] <alycidyne> mobidrop: more generally hardware programmers seem to be especially lazy
[13:20:59] <mrig> It is actually quite easy to do if you just turn the autofocus off, if you still can.

[14:38:59] <mrig> when you get the the scale of the actual photons wavelengths the party goes into overdrive!
[14:39:11] <DnzAtWrk> anyone know of a small compact quality microphone
[14:39:18] <DnzAtWrk> which you can stick to surfaces
[14:39:24] <mrig> DnzAtWrk what type of microphone?
[14:39:31] <mrig> what for I mean?
[14:39:32] <DnzAtWrk> I want to record noise from engines
[14:39:57] <DnzAtWrk> 44khz is perfectly sufficient
[14:40:01] <mrig> Depends what for.
[14:40:06] <DnzAtWrk> machine learning
[14:40:43] <DnzAtWrk> there isn't a whole lot of space for a large microphone
[14:40:50] <DnzAtWrk> and I may want more than one
[14:40:54] <mrig> So you would like an ambient recording made from a distance?
[14:40:56] <GeDaMo> Are pressure zone microphones still a thing?
[14:41:01] <DnzAtWrk> not at a distance no
[14:41:02] <DnzAtWrk> quite close
[14:41:29] <DnzAtWrk> maybe at 20-30 cm 
[14:41:31] <mrig> GeDaMo I think so.
[14:42:27] <mrig> DnzAtWrk you would need a massive dynamic range then if you want to capture both startup sound and the full running sound.
[14:42:39] <DnzAtWrk> running only is fine
[14:42:54] <DnzAtWrk> dynamic range messes with the ml
[14:45:31] <DnzAtWrk> also, usb is prefered
[14:45:36] <mrig> really depends on what frequency range you want to get detail inl
[14:45:36] <DnzAtWrk> so you don't need a digitizer
[14:45:46] <DnzAtWrk> 44 khz is overkill
[14:45:52] <DnzAtWrk> even 10 khz would probably be enough
[14:46:08] <DnzAtWrk> but 44 is fairly standard
[14:46:37] <mrig> are you talking about audio frequency or the sampling rate?
[14:46:39] <DnzAtWrk> I mean, how many engines do you hear that makes noise over 10 khz
[14:47:14] <mrig> all of them, the specifics of the signature are in the high pitch I would imagine.
[14:47:42] <mrig> depends on what you are trying to achieve though and also how much you have to spend.
[14:48:03] <DnzAtWrk> as long as it's less than a few thousand euro it's fine
[14:48:08] <DnzAtWrk> but even that seems total overkill
[14:48:24] <mrig> sure yes it would be for most things.
[14:48:47] <mrig> I'm tempted to say go for a decent preamp and use an sm57
[14:49:15] <DnzAtWrk> interesting
[14:49:18] <mrig> so a usb sound card and some cables and the mic

[16:53:48] <InPhase> pyzozord: It's helpful to force the slow brain online for code design.  The code tends to come out better.
[16:53:51] <pyzozord> my fast brain is servicable, but my slow brain is borderline unusable
[16:54:34] <pyzozord> InPhase: if only it didn't hurt so much to think deeply
[16:54:46] <pyzozord> hurt/require so much energy
[16:56:47] <pyzozord> it's possible that when I think deeply I use kind of "brute brain force" in the most inefficient way, and that there are frameworks to how think deeply more efficiently
[16:56:50] <InPhase> If it hurts (which it sometimes does), you probably have a health problem going on.  Probably from sour cream and onion flavor peanuts.  (No joke...  They typically have yeast extract which can disrupt deep thinking and make it painful.)
[16:58:09] <pyzozord> oh no it doesn't physicall hurt, I was just referring to the popular saying "thinking doesn't hurt"
[16:58:29] <pyzozord> well except where I overexert myself, than I can get a migrane indeed

[17:02:01] <InPhase> Get yourself in a good health state and 12 hours of deep thinking can be invigorating rather than exhausting and migraine inducing.

[22:00:06] <sonny> I don't think there is any tbh
[22:00:06] <pyzozord> maybe I called it wrong, maybe what I meant is actually more like context-free than context-sensitive in the formal sense

[22:29:36] <[itchyPunk]> √ºber is an anamoly
[22:29:47] <[itchyPunk]> because of over ambitious investors
[22:29:49] <sonny> one example is a company that is not performing, the other I have not checked myself
[22:29:57] <kveroneau> Currently, ISPs only give parental control at the router-level, which is good and all, but they could do better, as a lot of households never watch Porn.
[22:30:04] <sonny> the former usually goes bankrupt
[22:30:22] <[itchyPunk]> isp has no business messing with my dns and such

[22:30:55] <sonny> If I was a parent during the youtube red saga I'd be sending angry emails lol
[22:31:04] <kveroneau> Yeah, but sometimes people want the ISP to prevent unexpected ads from popping up for them or their children.

[22:34:48] <[itchyPunk]> ISP either control shit or they dont
[22:34:49] <kveroneau> With an ISP being able to give additional options to households, that's not a boolean.
[22:35:05] <[itchyPunk]> it is, once they have a mechanism to change DNS on the fly

[22:42:45] <kveroneau> nomagno, oh, I wrote a VM like that before.  It's really fun to write fictional VMs.
[22:43:25] <sonny> since the auto industry is big in NA, and if it's profitable I could seen it becoming a reality super quickly
[22:43:26] <Satin> EdFletcher: that's rather unnerving
[22:43:30] <InPhase> Satin: Waymo has it working residentially, Tesla has it working pretty decently on highways.  Merge the two and you have pretty much everything.
[22:43:43] <pyzozord> nomagno: perfect, after that you can start writing the game engine for your machine ;)
[22:43:54] <EdFletcher> Satin: yeah it was hilarious and scary at the same time, because it turned too tight on a corner meaning pedestrians were also at risk ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[22:43:55] <kveroneau> I also wrote a custom 6502 emulator, but didn't emulate any existing computer, but instead ran at full speed, and had custom hooks to perform stuff through the host that wouldn't normally be possible on 6502 hardware.
[22:44:00] <sonny> but that's in the political manuering type of senario
[22:44:04] <pyzozord> nomagno: but watch out to not grow the scope of the game engine to another vm
[22:44:17] <InPhase> Satin: From there it's just about regulatory comfort, and then consumer comfort.  But what we've seen from Tesla's customers is that the consumer comfort is already there.

[22:44:43] <bayaz> Title: Self-Driving Cars Could Be Decades Away, No Matter What Elon Musk Said 
[22:45:01] <sonny> there's just to many reasons to count
[22:45:03] <InPhase> Satin: I think it's a matter of a few years until they're marketed, and rolled out to markets which legally permit it.
[22:45:05] <Satin> ugh, didn't remember paywalled site
[22:45:06] <sonny> s/to/too/
[22:45:45] <pyzozord> I'd say 10 years and we might see at least one self driving car every day
[22:46:03] <InPhase> pyzozord: I think probably less than that.
[22:46:23] <InPhase> pyzozord: This is currently only a software problem which is already very close to ready.
[22:46:38] <pyzozord> InPhase: I'm considering poorer countries like Poland
[22:46:58] <sonny> more of a market thing
[22:47:02] <pyzozord> (although like in most countries Warsaw is much different from smaller cities)
[22:47:04] <InPhase> The accident rates on self-driving cars currently in use are favorable enough.  Just people will have lower tolerance for accidents with the self-driving ones, so it needs to get a notch better.
[22:47:10] <sonny> I'd say 50
[22:47:31] <nomagno> kveroneau: My VM doesn't really emulate any existing CPU, it emulates an ultra-RISC 11-instruction one, and the assembler can preprocess 
[22:47:31] <nomagno> [START subroutine], [END subroutine], and [CALL subroutine] instructions to achieve subroutine-like functionality. I probably need to add a 12th instrucrion to push/pop from the stack tough
[22:47:35] <pyzozord> (warsaw is the capital of poland)
[22:47:49] <EdFletcher> "fully self-driving cars on the road in 10 years" is the new "next year is the year of Linux on the Desktop", i swear. i've heard this refrain since at least 2012, and we're nearly a decade from that: where are they?
[22:47:56] <nomagno> I have reserved call stack memory region
[22:48:02] <Satin> EdFletcher: correct lmao

[22:48:24] <pyzozord> InPhase: I thought that the software problem is pretty much solved
[22:48:25] <nomagno> else I can't achieve proper recursion
[22:48:43] <pyzozord> InPhase: at least to the level where it most common situations it outperforms humans
[22:48:53] <Satin> has a good roundup of some of the reasons for why you might be overestimating readiness
[22:48:55] <EdFletcher> "most common situations" isn't the issue, at all.
[22:49:01] <vdamewood> Does the 6502 have any I/O instructions, or is I/O performed exclusively through memory mapping?
[22:49:03] <sonny> who's the market anyways?
[22:49:12] <GeDaMo> vdamewood: I think it's just memory mapped
[22:49:48] <nomagno> My VM definitely memory maps, tough I only defined a single byte for input and a single one for output
[22:49:50] <Satin> InPhase: that nyt piece has statements from waymo enginners etc as well
[22:49:58] <Satin> but yeah -> "Self-driving tech is not yet nimble enough to reliably handle the variety of situations human drivers encounter each day. It can usually handle suburban Phoenix, but it can‚Äôt duplicate the human chutzpah needed for merging into the Lincoln Tunnel in New York or dashing for an offramp on Highway 101 in Los Angeles."

[22:50:35] <EdFletcher> also let's be clear, this isn't "just a software problem." what will the level 5 cars do when they recognize a situation in which a human life _must_ be taken? do they protect the occupants, or protect the most number of lives? what legislation will inventibly be put forth to deal with such ethical questions? what strain on the legal system will it

[22:50:40] <vdamewood> I've been thinking of buying a 6502 clone to play with.

[22:54:30] <InPhase> Satin: That article talks about the cost of settlements.  Which I'm sure at the moment are larger.  But that doesn't mean they are actually riskier, that goes to uneven expectations from people who accept that humans miss things and accidentally kill each other, but expect machines to be perfect.
[22:55:07] <Satin> InPhase: it doesn't just mention settlements though. It mentions that the timelines are much longer than what expectations were voiced 7 years ago, hastily.
[22:55:18] <Satin> It could be the end of this decade, but even that is being optimistic, it asserts.

[22:56:38] <InPhase> Satin: It does, but it doesn't provide any convincing reason for this view.  I expect it to accelerate BECAUSE they are already in use, and every one of these incident cases is a test case update the way these cars store data.
[22:57:00] <Satin> ...even after it's cited industry analysts and a former waymo enginner etc?
[22:57:15] <Satin> Oh well. That was just my two cents.
[22:57:29] <EdFletcher> i genuinely do feel we'll see a lot more autonomous vehicles on-road by the end of the decade in limited environments (such as how waymo is doing it now), and use will accelerate but prematurely to the point that they start causing problems and we have to slow down and reconsider

When you have 64k of addressable memory, And you need to figure out where to put RAM, Boot ROM, and I/O, but you also have constraints like the stack register is only 8 bits, so the stack must be at 0x01XX, and the word at 0xFFFC is read as the address of the first instruction.

[23:30:29] <MrMobius> ya C is for CMOS so uses 50x less current or so. goes up to 14mhz instead of 1-2mhz of original. adds useful instructions like STZ and WAI. adds an indirect addressing mode without an index register

[23:38:37] <EdFletcher> for real time you don't want to use straight HTTP, the cost of each transaction is way too much. definitely use websockets if you can, a much better solution to any polling

[23:40:15] <EdFletcher> sgt_chuckles: a lot of people like socket.io which is a proprietary abstraction layer that uses both (websockets primarily but falls back to long-polling when they aren't available). personally, i say if you're not using a browser that can't do websockets, you can't use my stuff üòÜ
[23:40:20] <nomagno> I find websockets to add too many dependencies to the backend for most of these non-time-critical applications

[23:49:55] <kveroneau> vdamewood, with the 6502 everything is memory mapped, making it awesome to use in modern emulation to create a custom VM with.  There even exists a really good compiler toolchain cc65 for the 6502, and extending this C compiler to use a custom VM is super easy.
[23:50:30] <hxx> How do GUI toolkits like qt or gtk interface with drawing tablets? Is it built into the GUI framework? Can I write it myself if it doesn't exist for the framework?
[23:51:04] <sonny> drawing tablets and gui?
[23:51:33] <hxx> Krita, GIMP, etc are all programs that use your drawing tablet.
[23:51:44] <kveroneau> vdamewood, my 6502 VM was being used with my Online Hacking simulation game Hacker's Edge, which I lost interest as it got a bit too big, and beta players were starting to ask way too much for only a single dev(myself) to implement.
[23:51:48] <pyzozord> actually writing a browser game like ogame would be cool, shame that those games are no longer fashionable
[23:51:49] <hxx> Is it built into the toolkit or do the programs have to write it themselves?

[23:54:45] <MrMobius> WDC which sells the 65C02/65C816 has a "compiler" that is pretty atrocious which can output 65C816 binaries. cc65 is just 6502/65C02

[23:58:48] <kveroneau> For cross-platform GUI desktop apps these days I've been using Lazarus, as their GUI abstraction layer LCL based on Borland's VCL makes porting desktop applications 100% transparent to the developer.
