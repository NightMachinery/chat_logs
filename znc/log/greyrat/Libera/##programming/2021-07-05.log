[00:01:43] <pyzozord> I'm curious how do corutines work in languages like go? I heard it's something that is much more lightweight than a thread. And can that corutines be implemented in c?
[00:03:21] <GeDaMo> "Coroutines in one page of C" https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/455.php
[00:03:44] <GeDaMo> Looks like it uses setjmp
[00:03:46] <KillerWasp> jamea# you can make a script with /dev/random for generate a random names
[00:04:05] <nisstyre> pyzozord: you can implement coroutines in C using nothing but a macro with a switch/case construct
[00:04:18] <Thedarkb-Desktop> They're a bit janky though.
[00:04:33] <nisstyre> that's because they aren't scheduled according to a good algorithm
[00:04:42] <nisstyre> and it's not very fine grained
[00:04:59] <GeDaMo> In Forth, you can implement coroutines by fiddling with the return stack :P
[00:05:04] <nisstyre> well, that's a problem with coroutines in general I guess
[00:05:12] <nisstyre> scheduling is done by explicitly yielding
[00:05:26] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I have a love/hate relationship with Forth.

[00:05:56] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Chuck Moore has a lot of interesting ideas.
[00:06:36] <Thedarkb-Desktop> But it feels like Forth basically just turns into a domain specific language if you try to do anything in it.

[00:08:20] <immibis> pyzozord: they're just threads but with smaller stacks and without the kernel being involved in scheduling
[00:08:28] <mrig> pyzozord: green threads are another name for them.
[00:08:30] <immibis> at least the general concept. Don't know if that's how Go implements them
[00:08:42] <nisstyre> immibis: you can do coroutines with one stack
[00:08:58] <nisstyre> you just have to store what the current calling info is for each coroutine
[00:09:02] <immibis> technically yes, if you take all the state that would *normally* be on the stack, and put it somewhere else
[00:09:09] <nisstyre> or however you would describe that
[00:09:09] <immibis> in which case, why don't we call the "somewhere else" a stack too?
[00:09:18] <nisstyre> the intermediate values
[00:09:48] <nisstyre> immibis: I suppose it is, but you can do tail call elimination is my point
[00:10:03] <immibis> tail call elimination doesn't mean you don't need a stack...
[00:10:18] <nisstyre> no but it's smaller
[00:10:42] <immibis> ... if your stack would've had a lot of tail calls on it
[00:10:48] <immibis> then it's smaller. if not, it isn't
[00:11:34] <mrig> pyzozord: there is a really interesting talk given by sean partent on coroutines and his implementation of a scheduler for an adobe online project; Well worth a watch, i'll see if I can find it again.
[00:11:34] <nisstyre> well the coroutine has to yield control at some point before it's finished computing
[00:11:44] <nisstyre> otherwise it's not really a coroutine
[00:11:56] <nisstyre> it's just a regular function that does something
[00:12:30] <nisstyre> but I guess you could do that with non tail recursive functions
[00:12:39] <nisstyre> so yeah you'd have to store the entire stack
[00:13:00] <nisstyre> it'd be bad practice imo though
[00:14:19] <mrig> pretty sure it was this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIHy8pXbneI

[00:16:35] <pyzozord> awesome, sounds like I got something to do for the evening! :)
[00:17:52] <pyzozord> I askedf about the coroutines because I'm thinking about implementing a roguelike game to have a break, and I figured I'd need some kind of concurrency if I want my roguelike to not be turn based
[00:18:17] <mrig> many of his talks are really good, I've found.
[00:19:16] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I've never really thought about game entity systems as concurrency.
[00:19:49] <GeDaMo> https://dewitters.com/dewitters-gameloop/
[00:19:57] <DPA> I think a big benefit of co-routines, async functions, generators, and such compared to treads is more predictability. It's like everything except the yield/await is a critical section where stuff won't randomly change.
[00:21:47] <jamea> Does anyone know how to recalculate an inventory with the first-in, first-out method?  the algorithm is: 10 bulbs entered the warehouse at a price of 1 dollar, then 3 bulbs came out at a price of 1 dollar, then 12 bulbs came in at a price of 1.3 dollars, and then there is an exit of 17 bulbs, 7 at a price of 1 dollar and 10 at a price of 1.3 what I do, is the following: the 10 records
[00:21:47] <jamea> I create 10 individual records at a price of 1, then I eliminate 3 records (for the output) then 12 enter and I create 12 more records with a price of 1.3, then I remove the first 17 and so on ... in reality there are inputs of 5000 lights and outputs of 2800 and so on.  any advice?
[00:21:52] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: that's a good point, I could just do everything in a single thread/corutine. I'll consider doing that first then.

[00:31:13] <immibis> if it really is this easy, i'd think to create one row per product type (so one row for "BULBS") and then one column contains all the FIFO prices for that product type, in something like JSON or CSV
[00:31:33] <immibis> it seems suspiciously simple for a real-world system though
[00:32:18] <immibis> so you'd have "BULBS","7,1,12,1.3", next row ("SCREWS","1000,0.01,2000,0.015")

[00:33:55] <immibis> if they buy 1500 screws then afterwards you have "SCREWS","1500,0.015", because you took 1000 from 1000, deleted it, took another 500 from 2000

[03:35:40] <Huligan> Hi. I'm trying to implement LZSS decompression of ARJ archive (method 4 without Huffman codes). Where can I find format details? I've arj and unarj source code but it's not readable. It seems like ARJ implementation of LZSS is slightly different - it used not standard sliding window size (26624) and some very strange encoding of pointers to words in that window. I can't understand hot it's encoded. Could someone help me to understand it?

[10:30:37] <recursiveNode> khanred software architecture design
[10:30:43] <PlanckWalk> recursiveNode: Scrum isn't prescriptive about what processes happen for design.
[10:30:54] <PlanckWalk> I'm just saying that is where design usually happens.
[10:31:11] <khanred> recursiveNode, There isn't a separate "stage" for design
[10:31:17] <recursiveNode> PlanckWalk that's why I'm using an ad-hoc way and stuck figuring out a method
[10:32:34] <PlanckWalk> Even the most heavyweight methodologies don't prescribe a single process for design.  At best they provide hints and guides.
[10:33:15] <PlanckWalk> They usually do require that you *document* the design, follow various checkpoints, and often many of the inputs into the design process though.

[21:30:02] <recursiveNode> rindolf yes, it's ineffective, but I can't see any way to make it effective
[21:30:06] <Izem> I mean, the senario were someone doesn't want to change OSes since their software is not on the other platform
[21:30:08] <kodah> usually when you see old software in a distro repo it's because the OS depends on that particular version
[21:30:19] <teut> then that must be about ram what I told, I 'm unclear knowledge of on it
[21:30:21] <kodah> eg: python2
[21:30:24] <teut> of it*
[21:30:53] <teut> why say it two sets of register?
[21:31:00] <teut> why not say 32 registers?
[21:31:31] <GeDaMo> teut: hyperthreading is where a core tells the OS it's actually two cores
[21:31:53] <GeDaMo> It duplicates registers and other state but only has one sets of execution units
[21:32:13] <recursiveNode> rindolf i.e. today, I went through many hoops to learn that non-functional requirements really mean how the system/product should perform a functional requirement. And I found this image from a software engineering ISO: https://blog.seibert-media.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MindMap_Quality-1024x723.jpg
[21:32:14] <kodah> Izem: imo, the definition of "old software" is quite nebulous once you start talking about backporting
[21:32:29] <GeDaMo> As far as the OS is concerned it's two cores but the hardware switches transparently between the two sets of state
[21:32:39] <teut> oh you mean you can store   a binary code in one register and another in other register
[21:32:54] <recursiveNode> rindolf so, I've figured out an approach to specify functional and non-functional requirements in a mind map with xmind: https://i.imgur.com/Vahcz3A.png
[21:32:57] <GeDaMo> This is different from normal context switching where the OS is in control of saving and restoring thread state
[21:32:58] <teut> and since the registers are closer, the operation is faster

[21:33:26] <Izem> the problem is, if you make a new os what is the hardware model now?
