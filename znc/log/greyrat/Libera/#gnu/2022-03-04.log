[00:26:57] <tesseract> so, no experimental distros for me
[00:27:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the idea is to create a copyleft fork of openbsd codebase
[00:27:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> tesseract: nothing "experimental" about hyperbola
[00:27:39] <rhomb0id> why openbsd?
[00:27:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hyperbola actually uses a stable release schedule based on debain security patches
[00:27:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> nothing that many FSDG diftribution do

[00:28:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> rhomb0id: openbsd is the most secure and free of the bsds
[00:28:44] <tesseract> new stuff, on base
[00:28:50] <tesseract> no base*
[00:29:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> in the bsds is actually the opposite stangely enough
[00:29:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> open is the fresoftware one
[00:29:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> freebsd is the opensource one 
[00:29:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> tesseract: there is no new base
[00:29:40] <rhomb0id> what makes it more free?
[00:29:51] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> openbsd?

[00:40:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> something else that hyperbola adresses that is important for me is the fact that the linux kernel no longer is written with security and in mind. KSPP is basically a dead project and Grsec no longer is free software.
[00:40:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the last one but no so important one is the Rust trademark concerns
[00:41:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and how a trademark policy because is so far reaching
[00:41:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> afects the right a copyright license gives us

[00:43:23] <rhomb0id> the rust compiler  stability is more concerning than trademark IMO
[00:43:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so rhomb0id has you see linux current direction is divergent from our movement
[00:44:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "is more concerning than trademark IMO" please read that issue is explain in great detail
[00:44:25] <rhomb0id> current direction? they've been letting that junk in for decades
[00:44:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> indeed
[00:44:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> it no longer is sustainable though

[00:46:02] <rhomb0id> openbsd is stable? i thought i've heard that they will break userspace without much thought
[00:46:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is dead now
[00:46:11] *** Quits: zleap (~zleap@user/zleap) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:46:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> much more stable then the linux side
[00:46:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because given all the randomazation done
[00:46:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is much easier to find bugs
[00:47:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because they will come up more often
[00:47:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and so therefore by consequence fixed more often ;)
[00:47:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the only bad part about the openbsd project is the non-free bits and the permissive license aspect of it
[00:48:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> also the fact that is amonolith
[00:48:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the objective of hyperbola with the hyperbolaBSD project is to modularize it and make the derivative codebase GPLv3+
[00:49:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so other on the linux side can also use it without much dificulty

[00:59:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sounds like a plan ggoes thanks
[00:59:33] <rhomb0id> lol so any  dynamic library in openbsd is forbidden from using syscall ?
[00:59:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> will keep you updated
[00:59:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> rhomb0id: not so much forbidden
[01:00:01] <rhomb0id> https://www.openbsd.org/plus69.html -- Removed workaround permitting Go executables to do syscalls directly, forcing them to use shared libc like all other dynamic binaries. 
[01:00:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but more that the number of systemcalls have been reduced
[01:00:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> therefore there is the need for compromisse because of such

[01:02:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> rhomb0id: ^ to understand why syscall reductions is important for freedom->security->privacy
[01:03:16] <rhomb0id> it's not important
[01:03:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> jemarch: I have explain it above
[01:03:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "it's not important" that is a opinion based on less logic bases

[01:06:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> much of the implementations on the linux side are also subpar
[01:07:18] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and then less important matter of trademark policies being so obnoxious and overreaching that they affect right granted by copyright

[01:15:09] <leah> jemarch: pm me. i don't wanna de-rail here. i'm only here because i got highlighted
[01:15:16] <leah> looks like an interesting discussion about hyperbola though
[01:15:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and not alone but with evryone envolve
[01:15:20] <jemarch> leah: k
[01:15:28] <rhomb0id> since torvalds traded in his robe for a pair of khaki pants and a nice button up shirt
[01:15:32] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> now the focus is hyperbolaBSD though
[01:16:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ggoes: this is defenately not personal drama, is though about abusive actions taken that are quite relevant to the movement and GNU project itself
[01:16:40] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> because many of its members relly on libreboot
[01:17:06] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> we need transperency on this matters to avoid manipulation like it happend before :)
[01:17:18] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I do appreciate leah apology though
[01:17:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I know it was probably not easy to do :D
[01:18:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> rhomb0id: I dont think torvalds was ever really interested in the ideals

[01:44:47] <ggoes> yeah

[01:45:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is a lie
[01:45:58] <ggoes> please, both of you, i get the impulse to have it out here, but this isn't the place

[01:46:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> pleas provide evidence of me using that against anyone else please
[01:46:15] <leah> ggoes: i literally told him earlier to come attack me in #libreboot
[01:46:20] <vitali64[m]> Let them say whatever
[01:46:25] <leah> i want him to stop doing this shit here
[01:46:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I not attacking

[01:46:44] <leah> i'm really sorry about all this
[01:46:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sadly we are in loops given you repetatly continue to do it
[01:46:59] <leah> M3RELATIVISM[m]: but you earlier said everything was cool, that i apologized etc and that all was right
[01:47:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so you leave no other option but to provide evidence agaisnt you lies
[01:47:26] <leah> but then you went back to doing the same thing. i'm desperately trying to get you to be nice. i'm not your enemy and just want to do my things in peace and help people
[01:47:27] <ggoes> can we please just move this to #libreboot or some other channel where the people who are interested can watch
[01:47:34] <vitali64[m]> <vitali64[m]> I don't think irelativism tells the truth, or that leah tells the truth
[01:47:37] <ggoes> i can confidently tell you no one is interested here
[01:47:39] * M3RELATIVISM[m] wished to leave and go do something productive long ago
[01:47:45] <leah> then do that
[01:47:49] <leah> stop wasting everyone's time here
[01:47:49] * vitali64[m] goes away

[01:48:19] <leah> you are trouble
[01:48:28] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is another lie
[01:48:44] <leah> you're an absolute control freak with serious anger, and i'm your latest target
[01:48:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> 1. time vitali64  asked me why I used leahboot term
[01:49:13] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I presented eveidence in how to censor all dicenting voices within libreboot
[01:49:21] <leah> do you think i want to be here in #gnu, talking to you?
[01:49:29] <leah> i have a life, you know
[01:49:45] <leah> get lost and go bug another group
[01:49:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and try to get them kicked of places when providing proove for said actions
[01:50:05] <leah> i predict you'll start pissing people off in #hyperbola too, and get banned there. and you'll start calling them abusive too
[01:50:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the issue here is not so much bugging but more that I will not allow you to play your dirty manipulation and lie based games
[01:50:23] <vitali64[m]> You already got banned from #coreboot

[03:57:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Has for leah yet another lie/manipulation and dirty trick (whish by now doesnt suprise me), fallacy of atack to personality, no I will not get banned from either other room (including hyperbola), also this kind of double faced attacks to my person will not work agaisnt me so might as well stop doing them I know it was a usefull way to censor and ban other contributors in the past, hapelly Im to stuborn and to much of a believer in logic
[03:57:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and truth to allow that to fly,
[03:57:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> even though sadly you sucessfully used that technique to walk all over other people in the past.
[03:57:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Now regarding all this nonsensical waste of time, yes I also wish to be doing something else more productive, but if lies and manipulation continue I will also have to continue to call bullshit on then with concrete and logical refutions. No what I dont appreciate is the contempt in which fsf staff allows this to happend, and what impresses me even more is how this victim role is believe, in a effort to make it seam Im the one attacking
[03:57:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> here. Regardless Im a firm believer the the truth allways comes up no matter how many years it takes, eventually people will be confronted with this nasty behaviour for themselves.

[04:45:46] <leah> the *vast* majority of cases
[04:45:51] <leah> if linux-libre supports your device
[04:45:56] <leah> it's not because it lacks non-free firmware
[04:46:08] <GNUCracker> > "emacs is shit" 
[04:46:09] <leah> it's because the firmware is baked into some microcontroller or on separate mask rom, or even flash

[04:46:31] <leah> so on such systems where linux-libre supports everything, you're still ultimately relying on the same types of blobs

[04:46:36] <leah> they're just already in your device
[04:46:38] <leah> whereas
[04:46:50] <leah> on some other hardware, the device lacks firmware and has it supplied by the kernel
[04:46:57] <leah> it's the same lack of freedom in either case
[04:47:23] <leah> but i argued to you in #fsf that actually, it's better the kernel be in your kernel, rather than baked into the device. because if it's in the kernel, it's more directly exposed and you can more easily reverse engineer and replace it

[04:55:57] <leah> but you talk about software being hardware, when it isn't. and a movement is currently in its infancy, but with real-world proof of concept today, showing what's possible now
[04:56:57] <leah> the most conservative interpretation of fsf standards leaves you with a system that is full of non-free software, just it's not running on your cpu so you don't care. i want to go beyond that and bring about a world where everything is free
[04:57:14] <footron> is it like a shortcut during production?  "F it, we'll just release a firmware update"
[04:57:25] <leah> instead of arguing that hardware is not our domain, i want to explore it. and make sure that every computer you buy is fully controlled and understood by you, the owner
[04:57:44] <leah> current fsf standards are ok with a machine where the chips are a complete pandora's box, with all kinds of firmware baked in
[04:57:49] <footron> an anti-pattern  if you will
[04:57:53] <leah> libre silicon movement is going to change that
[04:58:17] <leah> isf: show me a single instance where i've suggested that proprietary software is ok
[05:00:24] <leah> to be clear, i'm not merely talking about free board schematics
[05:00:43] <leah> i'm talking about... how to make your own tiny little transistors, from scratch. and build entire CPUs. yourself. in your basement
[05:00:57] <leah> there are people doing this today
[05:01:09] <leah> jeri ellsworth showed a proof of concept years ago and sam zeloof expanded upon it
[05:01:15] <leah> and now libre silicon project exists based on sam's work
[05:01:17] <leah> it's great

[05:04:17] <leah> isf: there's a thing called a lithography stepper which beams down gate patterns onto a die, and it's usually really expensive equipment
[05:04:21] <leah> wanna know what sam did?
[05:04:30] <leah> he bought a $100 DLP projecter off of amazon
[05:04:35] <leah> and modified it to build one
[05:04:41] <leah> let me find the video. he's amazing
[05:07:01] <leah> found it
[05:07:05] <leah> isf: https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=Nxz_ENnmgtI
[05:07:07] <leah> watch this
[05:07:10] <leah> it will blow your mind
[05:07:39] <leah> it cost him like $100 to build
[05:07:43] <leah> with used parts
[05:07:53] <leah> intel spends billions on this kind of equipment
[05:08:01] <leah> he did it himself with low end equipment
[05:09:13] <leah> isf: the current version of his chip, which again he makes himself, in his basement, has 1200 transistors. early intel CPUs had about 2000 transistors
[05:09:32] <leah> and his work will expand. imagine building a whole computer that can boot a real linux kernel
[05:09:45] <leah> this i think will happen in 5 years, if the work continues
[05:10:06] <leah> and it completely invalidates the "software as circuitry" argument
[05:10:12] <footron> hopefully his workspace has adequate ventilation
[05:11:22] <leah> sam zeloof, and the people in the libre silicon project
[05:11:24] <leah> those people
[05:11:32] <leah> they are like stallman
[05:11:41] <leah> but they're doing free silicon, not free software
[05:11:49] <leah> it's the same mentality. and i think this work is vitally important
[05:11:53] <leah> including for free software
[05:12:10] <leah> fsf currently ignores it and brushes it off entirely. such is seen in a *recent* libreplaned-discuss thread
[05:12:27] <leah> "it doesn't boot linux yet" is more or less the kind of dismissive response rms had, on that thread. you can see it yourself
[05:12:37] <leah> the thread was in january of this year, and extended into february
[05:12:44] <leah> and sam's work was mentioned in it, multiple times
[05:13:21] <footron> and safety precautions
[05:13:21] <leah> rms kept repeating the same argument that making your own chip at home won't happen for another 30 years or something
[05:13:25] <leah> sam zeloof is doing it today
[05:13:29] <leah> *today*
[05:13:32] <footron> hazardous chemicals disposed of responsibly
[05:13:37] <leah> chips exist today, that he made. himself. alone

[05:13:45] <leah> while he was a highschool student
[05:14:05] <lagash> wish my HS years were that productive..
[05:14:26] <leah> so i strongly advise you to throw away everything you've been taught
[05:14:28] <leah> because
[05:14:30] <leah> this man
[05:14:37] <leah> has rewritten the book on the software and hardware freedom movement
[05:14:50] <footron> throw away everything because some rando built a processor?
[05:14:58] <leah> and he did it while he was bored
[05:15:25] <footron> how many lawns did he mow for the initial funding?
[05:15:41] <leah> none
[05:15:44] <leah> i mean
[05:15:49] <leah> he did it on a really low budget
[05:16:40] <leah> any normal person with the right mind can learn what he does, and repeat his work. it's something that you can do, today

[05:17:03] <footron> with the investment
[05:17:21] <leah> he probably spent about $10k
[05:17:33] <leah> which is peanuts when you consider intel is spending billions
[05:17:55] <leah> he built most of his equipment himself
[05:18:40] <leah> he actually shows it all on his channel
[05:18:56] <leah> i encourage you to watch all of the videos on his channel, and also read libresilicon.com and watch their fosdem talk
[05:19:09] <leah> sam's channel: https://vid.puffyan.us/channel/UC7E8-0Ou69hwScPW1_fQApA
[05:19:15] <footron> don't get me wrong, it is impressive  i just don't see how i'm supposed to throw away everything i know, and abandon other forms of programmable hardware
[05:19:25] <leah> fosdem talk (improving upon sam's work, showing how to do all this):
[05:19:27] <leah> https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fosdem/2022/D.open-hardware/libresilicon.webm
[05:19:46] <leah> footron: well, what you know is this: only focus on software, because mortals can't make their own chips yet
[05:19:58] <leah> that's what you should throw away. because this assumption has been invalidated
[05:20:03] <leah> it's no longer true
[05:20:08] <leah> reality has changed
[05:20:15] <footron> but how is it going to help me, the average user
[05:20:56] <footron> this perosn is going to need millions in funding to get up to speed
[05:21:07] <footron> adnd by then who knows what leeches will have latched on
[05:21:23] <leah> that's a defeatist attitude. stop that. and there's crowdfunding if you need more money
[05:21:35] <leah> don't invent limitations. smash them
[05:22:01] <footron> smash them when
[05:22:08] <footron> this route may take 50 years
[05:22:11] <footron> others could be less
[05:22:14] <leah> 5
[05:22:27] <leah> i predict we will have homemade computers running debian in 5 years
[05:22:41] <LohanG> The two are not exactly comparable when you consider the process of making, modifying, distributing your own software or free software vs doing the same with free hardware. Resources are finite. You can meaningfully *discuss* free *hardware design*.
[05:22:42] <leah> and companies selling them
[05:22:52] <leah> making computers themselves. in their house
[05:22:53] <LohanG>  But if you push for a combination of free sf and hardward along these lines, it will be counterproductive imho. 
[05:23:00] <leah> with all free software
[05:23:05] <LohanG> s/hardward/hardware
[05:23:09] <leah> and free *silicon*
[05:23:25] <leah> we're not talking about "hardware" generically here
[05:23:35] <LohanG> hmmm
[05:23:37] <leah> usually with "free hardware" you mean free pcb design
[05:23:42] <leah> we're talknig about silicon
[05:23:57] <leah> the ability to make your own ICs from scratch
[05:24:09] <leah> filled with all those tiny, tiny transistors
[05:24:14] <leah> that you made
[05:24:16] <leah> yourself
[05:24:18] <leah> from scratch
[05:24:41] <leah> it has already been done. now it needs to be done again. and again. and improved upon
[05:25:45] <leah> this is the real deal
[05:26:42] <leah> and that's a revolution. it used to be that how to make your own transistor so small was secret knowledge only a few companies had
[05:26:47] <leah> how to actually do it
[05:27:02] <footron> it's dangerous
[05:27:13] <leah> so was launching a rocket into space the first time
[05:27:23] <footron> like meth-lab dangerous
[05:27:27] <leah> so what?
[05:27:29] <footron> lol
[05:27:39] <leah> being alive is dangerous

[05:28:43] <leah> and temperatures of like 1000c
[05:28:44] <footron> hydroflouric or somesuch?
[05:28:51] <leah> yeah
[05:29:12] <leah> he actually shows all that stuff and how to take precautions
[05:29:21] <leah> but yeah this is dangerous work. but so what?

[05:30:04] <leah> this is irc so
[05:30:15] <leah> being invited to a channel called ##chemicals is sus af :P
[05:30:30] <leah> but ok
[05:30:48] <leah> they are empty channels
[05:31:30] <lagash> leah: what do you think of RISC-V? I've been rather excited since it's an open, RISC ISA and all that..
[05:31:43] <leah> anyway, i said everything i need to i think? yeah look at jeri ellsworth's video on how to make transistors. then look at sam zeloof's work. and look at libre silicon project
[05:31:54] <leah> lagash: well, i know intel recently announced they were getting involved
[05:31:59] <leah> so i expect it'll be dead in 2 years
[05:32:08] <leah> everything they touch turns to shit
[05:32:10] <lagash> that was a worrying sign, yes
[05:32:24] <leah> and riscv is the isa
[05:32:26] <leah> which is great but
[05:32:32] <leah> can you make it yourself?
[05:32:34] <leah> answer: yes
[05:32:38] <leah> answer: also no
[05:32:44] <leah> not yet
[05:32:51] <leah> answer: patents
[05:32:52] <lagash> it'll be easier than something more bloated no?
[05:32:55] *** Joins: nun (~nun@178.115.236.156.static.drei.at)
[05:33:12] <leah> there are patents owned by sifive pertaining to performance optimizations when making those chips
[05:33:14] <leah> and like
[05:33:21] <leah> good luck making your own that actually runs well
[05:33:32] <leah> but it's at least better than arm or openpower
[05:33:52] <lagash> I've seen some open softcores that look pretty cool, I'm no hardware expert, though
[05:33:56] <leah> i've concluded that it's not even worth my time looking at. sam zeloof's work and libre silicon project are what we should be focusing on
[05:34:15] <leah> they're talking about techniques actually how to make chips, irrespective of what circuits you're actually building
[05:34:15] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[05:34:24] <leah> means to production, you could say
[05:34:37] <leah> so riscv project defines what to make
[05:34:43] <leah> sam zeloof is telling you how to actually do it
[05:34:57] <leah> it's all a bit up in the air until things can progress further
[05:35:12] <leah> lagash: by softcores i assume you mean fpga stuff?
[05:35:20] <lagash> yes, FPGA
[05:35:27] <leah> i mean, yeah
[05:35:40] <leah> trouble with fpga's is, they're kinda proprietary at the moment
[05:35:46] <leah> anything halfway decent is proprietary
[05:35:52] <leah> so we kinda need more work on that
[05:35:59] <leah> but that's no reason not to use them
[05:36:01] <lagash> then make just one libre FPGA and we're good to go!
[05:36:10] <leah> use the best tool available. and if that tool is proprietary... make one that's free
[05:36:15] <lagash> or, well, more progressed anyways
[05:36:23] <leah> and do it better
[05:36:37] <lagash> also I believe some of these softcores made it to silicon as well.. it's been awhile since I've checked
[05:36:39] <leah> i'm not really sure what you're asking though
[05:36:41] <leah> like
[05:36:51] <leah> "what do you think about riscv"
[05:36:55] <leah> is a really open ended question
[05:37:14] <leah> what i think is that it's great. but that answer isn't very useful to you
[05:37:41] <lagash> as long as Intel etc doesn't choke it I think it's a good way forward
[05:37:50] <leah> i mean
[05:37:58] <leah> i have a hunch as to why intel's interested in it
[05:38:19] <leah> they probably want to continue peddling x86 stuff, but i think maybe they want to replace their current ME coprocessor
[05:38:34] <leah> right now their ME processors are downscaled 486 CPUs running minix
[05:38:44] <leah> i'm guessing they like riscv because they want to make a new ME out of it
[05:39:05] <leah> which, if they do that... i guess it won't hurt riscv project, it just means now they have a more efficient ME in their x86 processors eh?
[05:39:11] <leah> which is... meh. intel is boring
[05:39:26] <leah> riscv is free so it's not like they can destroy it
[05:39:36] <leah> people see value in it from the freedom perspective and i think it will be fine
[05:39:41] <leah> but....
[05:39:44] <leah> the issue is patents
[05:40:18] <leah> everyone talks about riscv being a free thing, but they're thinking about copyright. and some people talk about it being permissive... again. copyright
[05:40:20] <leah> but

[05:40:28] <leah> patents? those pertain to how to make a product
[05:40:32] <leah> how things are made
[05:40:39] <leah> means of production, you could say
[05:40:52] <leah> and that's the thing that we really should be thinking about
[05:40:58] <leah> because a free isa is all well and good
[05:41:15] <leah> but if you can't actually make it yourself without sifive or intel suing the pants off of you, what then?
[05:41:58] <leah> answer: it becomes a reference design i guess, for education. but then a few companies get to actually make it
[05:42:28] <leah> and then the whole thing kind of feels like a farce, no?

[05:53:01] <leah> it will be useful, while i'm reading, for you to summarize for me what this is about
[05:54:03] <lagash> basically a part of a system being free or libre is that it can be understood, right?
[05:54:37] <lagash> you only have a binary blob, it's much more opaque than say having the original source code

[06:03:06] <leah> lagash: you said it would be controversial, but actually i think it makes a ton of sense
[06:03:11] <leah> though
[06:03:14] <leah> sometimes

[06:04:11] <leah> sometimes, complexity isn't a bad thing
[06:04:17] <leah> they support a ton of use-case scenarios and systems

[06:04:42] * lagash mumbles something about irreducible complexity.
[06:05:39] <leah> yeah well, suckless is a great example of what you're saying, taken to its extreme, that's why i brought it up
[06:05:44] <leah> but you know, that approach also has flaws
[06:06:15] <leah> i guess, rather than be rigid about it.... 
[06:06:23] <leah> adopt a "use the best tool for the job" mindset

[06:09:21] <leah> but yeah like
[06:09:26] <leah> building a car is expensive and complicated
[06:09:45] <leah> sometimes you just want a bicycle, so you can quickly just ride to the supermarket to pick up a few groceries
[06:09:48] <footron> im scared might be banned theregasoline car yeah
[06:09:51] <leah> and you can make your own bicycle easy
[06:10:03] <footron> arrfff   hot buffer!
[06:10:03] <leah> we learned that in engineering class when i went to school
[06:10:23] <leah> the car/bicycle analogy works quite well, for this mindset
[06:10:47] <leah> and honestly
[06:10:54] <leah> biking it everywhere is so much more rewarding
[06:11:57] <leah> yeah and maybe you learn how to make a car
[06:12:09] <leah> but you don't know how to build one with abs
[06:12:32] <leah> so you have to put a bit more elbow grease into the steering wheel
[06:12:57] <leah> but hey. you built a car
[06:12:59] <leah> :S

[06:25:40] <leah> maybe sam has something on it idk. take a look
[06:30:40] <leah> "reducing the complexity of knowledge" - civboot looks great. i'm definitely going to have that on my radar from now on
[06:31:34] <leah> except. anything really complex is usually just something much simpler, repeated and copied
[06:31:56] <leah> a large program is still basically just lots of if statements and for loops :P
