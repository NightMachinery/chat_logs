[00:03:31] <Urchin[emacs]> I've finally watched The Tempest (Shakespeare's play), which gets referenced pretti often in anime
[00:04:05] <Bco1981> isn't there a movie called that ?
[00:04:27] <Urchin[emacs]> main character is a nice guy, if you look past the slavery and being a feudal monarch parts
[00:04:38] <Urchin[emacs]> Bco1981: there's probably a bunch of adaptations
[00:05:48] <Bco1981> ah probably, this is the one i was thinking of https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1274300/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1

[02:40:09] <Bco1981> was it dell ?

[07:15:58] <MootPoot> I guess its when it turns from a real time computer to a event based one?
[07:16:04] <CanadianFascism> MootPoot: the stm32 is a microcontroller as is the RP2040 (raspberry pi pico)
[07:16:10] <CanadianFascism> they cannot host an OS though
[07:16:15] <CanadianFascism> they just run one program
[07:16:17] <CanadianFascism> I mean you know this
[07:16:18] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u should watch that replay
[07:16:29] <MootPoot> the rp2040 has a bios and bootloader etc though
[07:16:33] <MootPoot> it boots into SOMETHING
[07:16:34] <MootPoot> idk what
[07:16:41] <MootPoot> brb shit

[07:17:26] <CanadianFascism> no
[07:17:30] <CanadianFascism> it boots into the program you wrote
[07:17:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> yes. Are you suggesting I cannot write a minimal kernel for it?
[07:18:10] <CanadianFascism> you can but it won't necessarily support things one expects in modern OS kernels
[07:18:12] <CanadianFascism> like memory protection
[07:18:17] <CanadianFascism> because the mcu may lack an MMU
[07:18:17] <MootPoot> No, you have to drag a boot file into it 
[07:18:24] <MootPoot> Before it'll do anything 
[07:18:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> CanadianFascism: Well yes, but that's just as bad as old-school computers is all.
[07:18:32] <MootPoot> Then it runs my program 
[07:18:57] <MootPoot> It has a separate boost file for processing c++ and micropython
[07:19:01] <MootPoot> Idk if that counts 
[07:19:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And unaided memory protection is still possible. It certainly helps if it's a design consideration in the OS/kernel for it.
[07:19:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It being implemented in hardware means it's faster and sometimes also doesn't require explicit care.
[07:19:49] <CanadianFascism> Aurora_v_kosmose: ah
[07:19:53] <CanadianFascism> Aurora_v_kosmose: btw there is a thing called FreeRTOS
[07:20:05] <CanadianFascism> and also Fuzix (a unix-like kernel written by Linux kernel guy Alan Cox)
[07:20:16] <CanadianFascism> there are some limitations though.. 15 processes max,
[07:20:21] <CanadianFascism> no mmu -> no memory protection
[07:20:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not particularly knowledgeable regarding the STM32, so I don't know if its memory buses are directly addressable from the outside or something similar.

[09:21:08] <MootPoot> my parents told me if I want to do a masters they can have my back for the next few years 
[09:21:18] <MootPoot> so I'm good on income / housing
[09:21:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, nya~ :3
[09:21:24] <isekaijin> Great!

[09:21:52] <MootPoot> why not
[09:21:53] <MootPoot> slut
[09:22:04] <Sadale> lol k
[09:22:15] <MootPoot> isekaijin: but mainly I'm just wondering about it - I can get one of those online masters from the  US
[09:22:19] <MootPoot> while living here in mooseland
[09:22:53] <MootPoot> from a top10 uni - they seem to not have too big of a problem handing out admissions for those since it costs a lot less to enter somebody online vs IRL
[09:23:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just so you know I just had a fap session that ended with ruined orgasm
[09:23:25] <MootPoot> that dosen't count

[09:26:05] <Nanobot> MC is in love with his girlfriend as a friend. One day, during sex, he asks if she'd like to play video games with him sometime. She hesitates and says, "I'm not sure my *gasp* heart is ready for that-- AHN! kind of thing." That's not the answer MC wanted to hear, and now he's worried he may have just ruined his love life. They climax and go to sleep.
[09:26:27] <MootPoot> but anyway
[09:26:37] <MootPoot> supposedly the total cost will be about 12k USD

[09:27:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: ?
[09:27:49] <MootPoot> me getting a masters degree
[09:28:08] * Aurora_v_kosmose shrugs
[09:28:14] <MootPoot> do you have one?
[09:28:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm thinking if it's actually worth getting a master degree tho
[09:28:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't.
[09:28:24] <Sadale> Like the ROI
[09:28:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not sure how worth it it'd be here anyway.
[09:28:39] <MootPoot> yeah, I'm looking at like 12-13k usd
[09:28:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Like... I'd be going back into sleep-deprivation student life for what... maybe 10k more a year?
[09:28:56] <MootPoot> so even if I make more later on I can benefit from that 
[09:28:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not worth the QoL loss
[09:29:02] <Sadale> The opportunity cost. By studying you'd miss a couple of years of time of making money
[09:29:18] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: well, presumably a masters opens up c-suite positions
[09:29:28] <MootPoot> 50k+ on top
[09:29:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hah, I'm not getting in those anyway.
[09:29:48] <Sadale> Assuming that you're getting 40k post-tax, that'd be 80k of lost income due to opting for a master degree.
[09:30:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I might not have a GNU tattoo but that's mostly because I've got no ink at all.
[09:30:24] <Sadale> actually doess c-suite requires a master degree? I've no idea on how it works over there. But here I think that connection and shit are far more important.
[09:30:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> C-suite requires starting your own business because you aren't getting into those if you can't play nice with corposcum.
[09:30:44] <MootPoot> A lot of management roles wont even talk to you unless you have a masters
[09:30:57] <MootPoot> even if you're more experienced
[09:31:02] <Sadale> weird.
[09:31:08] <Sadale> Maybe that's how it works over there.
[09:31:09] <MootPoot> especially in the larger companies , but connections matter too
[09:31:21] <MootPoot> like, connections get you the job, but masters opens it
[09:31:22] <Sadale> oh if you're talking about larger companies, maybe. I've never worked for a larger one.
[09:31:23] <MootPoot> afaik
[09:31:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Larger companies almost guarantee a high concentration of corposcum
[09:32:05] <Sadale> Out of the three companies I've joined, only one seems to require academia shit for promotion and shit.

[09:34:18] *** Joins: Azlux (~Azlux@user/azlux)
[09:34:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'd recommend you actually ask for feedback from someone who actually hold a master degree over there.
[09:34:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah. Your country might differ in what it requires.
[09:34:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, I find the idea of getting a master degree = 150k+ income highly questionable.
[09:34:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In mine I'd say nepotism matters a lot more than Ms.
[09:35:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So basically, get good at blowing.
[09:35:24] <Sadale> Not just look for the successful examples. Also look for failure examples.
[09:36:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But seriously though. In this country you aren't getting into C-suite stuff unless you're friends or family with the owners.
[09:37:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At least not in the big corpos.
[09:37:07] <Sadale> which country you're talking about?
[09:37:07] <MootPoot> yeah, for me I'm probably just gonna stick to the US or canada
[09:37:20] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: sounds like eastern europe or asia

[09:37:32] <MootPoot> its a sekrit
[09:37:33] <Sadale> I mean if you really want to get to C-suite you could just start your own company and lose all your savings :P
[09:37:37] <MootPoot> lololol
[09:37:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: That is actually an option I mentioned earlier.
[09:37:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Instant C-suite, no interview.
[09:38:03] <Sadale> xD
[09:38:19] <MootPoot> tbh its for a mixed number of reasons
[09:38:32] <Sadale> Makes me wonder if this kind of experience would even be valued if you decided to get a day job.
[09:38:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You don't need to be C-suite for getting a decent paycheck though, if that's all you're concerned with.
[09:39:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In which case papers can help, as does experience, as does nepotism (again).

[09:46:47] <MootPoot> like having 10 usb ports but you can only use 2 at a time for i2c
[09:46:53] <MootPoot> and only 2 specific ones

[09:48:52] *** Joins: sscout (~sscout@user/sscout)
[09:48:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, I haven't tested it. Based on the table, my guess is that, you could use multiple pins that map to the sase I2C interface. But I don't see any point of doing that.
[09:49:10] <MootPoot> so its just a convenience thing
[09:49:30] <MootPoot> so ultimately I have 2 UART, 2 SPI, and 2 I2C I can use, and its upto me which pins I use for it
[09:49:37] <Sadale> yep. I think so./
[09:49:50] <MootPoot> then what do I do with the GP pins
[09:50:23] <Sadale> For basic IO. Like lighting up LED, button detection, etc.
[09:50:52] <Sadale> For I2C, technically speaking, you can connect multiple I2C modules to the same bus as long as there address 
[09:50:55] <MootPoot> can I turn those into a UART/SPI/I2C as well?
[09:50:56] <Sadale> For I2C, technically speaking, you can connect multiple I2C modules to the same bus as long as there's no address clash
[09:52:53] <MootPoot> I'm kind of starting to get concerned about how much I/O and power I have on the RP2040
[09:52:56] <MootPoot> I might actually run out
[09:53:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, There's only UARTx2, SPIx2 and I2Cx2. You could technically turn any GPIO pins into I2C/SPI/UART without using the hardware UART/SPI/I2C interfaces. That's known "bit-bangging". However, it'd be very inefficient as you're doing it by software.
[09:53:53] <MootPoot> inefficient how - do you mean in terms of compute or code
[09:53:57] <Sadale> For pico I think you can program the PIO and turn it into UART or SPI or I2C. I've no idea on how you could do that. But I've heard that it's possible.
[09:54:20] <Sadale> Both. Requires a lot of computational power and code and perhaps alsso memory and shit.
[09:55:04] <Sadale> You do bit-banging only when you absolutely have to
[09:55:29] *** Quits: sscout (~sscout@user/sscout) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:56:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, For I2C and SPI, you can multiplex multiple devices/modules with the sasme interface. For UART you need an interface for each device/module.
[09:57:03] <MootPoot> is there like a spi chip I can get that converts spi to uart or something
[09:57:23] <Sadale> I suppose so. But why? And what are you actually trying to do?
[09:57:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Probably.
[09:57:39] <MootPoot> need to drive 10 SPI displays but I have only 2 SPI interfaces on the pico
[09:59:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, ah. If that's the case, you probably only need one SPI interface. For SPI, there's a "CS" pin for each of the display module. It's used for enabling the display module. So all of your SPI displays would share the same MOSI, MISO and SCLK. On top of that, each of your SPI display would need a dedicated GPIO for driving the CS.

The downside is that it doesn't support as much I2C/UART/SPI interfaces as similar priced microcontrollers. And it lacks RTC. And it isn't as power efficient in sleep mode.
[10:07:30] <MootPoot> alright- there are TWO projects, I should clarify
[10:07:53] <MootPoot> 1.) macro pad with LCD 2.) macro bar with lots of small lcds ( the spi multiplex one ) 
[10:08:12] <MootPoot> 1.) just has one large lcd
[10:08:22] <MootPoot> 2.) the small displays will only do text
[10:08:29] <MootPoot> showing what macro is on there
[10:08:32] <MootPoot> or maybe a small icon
[10:09:26] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: there are two SPI interfaces I can use on the pico, and the lcds support 4 addresses each - so use those two interfaces and maybe only use 8 instead of 10, or just bitbang the other two
[10:09:30] * Sadale wonders how long it's gonna take MootPoot to complete the project :P
[10:09:43] <MootPoot> there is a third project as well lol
[10:09:46] <MootPoot> :3
[10:09:52] * Sadale meanwhile laughing with his clock that had took him a year and still ongoing xD
[10:09:54] <MootPoot> I plan to finish that one first
[10:10:06] <MootPoot> third one is a lot simpler
[10:10:12] <MootPoot> so that one is first
[10:10:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Ah I see
[10:10:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, ... just multiplex 10 SPI displays with one SPI interface.
[10:11:21] <MootPoot> project 3.) hit feedback for targets at the range - magnetically attach to the back of a target ( they are made of metal ) - then report 2 things back to the main reciver device - if it hit or not and the other one is gps coordiates
[10:11:38] <MootPoot> the recivier will also have gps in it so it can calculate the distance
[10:12:02] <MootPoot> Sadale: didnt you tell me those devices only support 4 addresses?
[10:12:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, that's for the I2C variant
[10:12:44] <MootPoot> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[10:12:53] <MootPoot> but I thought I2c could do like 128 devices or something
[10:13:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, what's the I2C display you've shown me again?
[10:13:48] <Sadale> link please
[10:14:03] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: isekaijin Sadale  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001560188430.html scroll down and look at the LCD - imagine it said something like "IRC" to launch IRC and has a mechancial switch mounted under to sense when I push the display

[10:14:06] <MootPoot> that's the link
[10:14:14] <MootPoot> I ordered 10 SPI version
[10:14:30] <Sadale> SSD1306.
[10:14:37] <Sadale> That's the chipset.
[10:15:38] <MootPoot> that's not the driver name?
[10:15:49] <MootPoot> in python I install SSD_1306 to run it
[10:16:51] <isekaijin> MootPoot: Let's see.
[10:17:02] <Sadale> MootPoot, For this model of display, if you're using the I2C variant, you could only multiplex two I2C display. That's because it only have one slave address bit as shown in section 8.1.5 https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf

[10:17:27] <MootPoot> I got lucky then
[10:17:36] <MootPoot> I thought I fucked up when I ordered SPI instead of I2C
[10:17:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, For the SPI variant you can multiplex as much as you want because there's a CS# pin as shown in section 8.1.4: :3
[10:18:01] <MootPoot> ah
[10:18:05] <MootPoot> sweet
[10:18:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, I thought that it was the other way around. I thought that what you told me was that you've ordered many I2C variants.

[14:08:51] <MootPoot> I really wanna see power draw numbers 
[14:08:55] <Bco1981> like the argon one.
[14:09:25] <JesseDesu> HubertFarnsworth, i sent an email and got no reply from the school
[14:09:29] <MootPoot> For that you might be out of luck... Best option would be printing a case using mettalic looking filament 
[14:09:43] <MootPoot> Not many places make cases for smaller boards 
[14:09:56] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I should be home in about 30 minutes. Then I can figure out if she was bluffing or not. My doctor said she is surely bluffing 
[14:13:36] <Bco1981> MootPoot: but, it's not exactly cheap.
[14:13:59] <MootPoot> considering the performance I would argue it is cheap
[14:15:22] <MootPoot> it Bco1981 https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/intel-celeron-n4020 if you bought a mini pc that was x86 ( with much shittier I/O ) this is what you would get for about 230 USD
[14:15:22] <ImoutoBot> [title] Intel Celeron N4020 Benchmarks - Geekbench Browser
[14:15:45] <MootPoot> compare that to about 150-160 for the 4gb verion of the rock5 and the MUCH better I/O
[14:15:46] <Bco1981> hmm
[14:15:57] <Bco1981> id' go for the 16gb version
[14:16:17] <MootPoot> I guess if you wanted to use it as a proper desktop
[14:16:30] <MootPoot> I was thinking of it more like a network device so I could do with much less
[14:16:57] <Bco1981> i would be using it as a plaything/emulator
[14:17:19] <Bco1981> maybe media player too.
[14:17:56] <MootPoot> but yeah, even with 16gb of ram that thing is a steal
[14:18:09] <MootPoot> those 230 USD mini pcs come with like 4 or 6
[14:18:16] <MootPoot> although they do have a case and storage
[14:18:23] <Bco1981> i think i will sign up for one. then i can get a case later.
[14:18:27] <MootPoot> usually 128gb or 64gb built in
[14:18:38] <MootPoot> is there a sign up? I didnt look
[14:18:57] <Bco1981> add to cart, is like a "sign up/get in line"
[14:19:37] <Bco1981> and paying ofcourse
[14:19:43] <Bco1981> "products we sell can go as high as 4-9 months between production runs."
[14:19:45] <MootPoot> you pay the full price upfront?
[14:19:49] <MootPoot> or a deposit
[14:20:16] <Bco1981> not sure, in denmark it's not allows to take the money until you send the product.
[14:20:17] <MootPoot> I want it but I cant commit to a full price just yet
[14:20:26] <MootPoot> its a chinese website so idk if they care
[14:20:28] <MootPoot> about that
[14:20:32] <Bco1981> exactly
[14:20:55] <Bco1981> Certain events are out of our control which may result in a loss of preorder funds, such as a manufacturer going into bankruptcy or closing unexpectedly.
[14:21:04] <Bco1981> i guess you pay upfront
[14:21:08] <Bco1981> looking at that.
[14:23:16] <Bco1981> also Preorders cannot be cancelled/refunded once placed. We are often required to place a non-refundable deposit with the manufacturer well in advance of availability.
[14:24:10] <MootPoot> so according to geekbench, I'm not 100% sure if you can just compare scores like that but I am going to
[14:24:18] <MootPoot> its about as powerful as a flagship phone from 2-3 years ago

[14:25:13] <Bco1981> just looking at the rpi4 vs the rock5, is good enough for me. and seeing the c2q getting floored too just confirms it for me.
[14:25:34] <MootPoot> so is it full price upfront?

[14:27:00] <MootPoot> so apparently you can either buy it now at full price, or pay a deposit and get 50 bucks off when they ship the next production run
[14:27:43] <MootPoot> although this is from a reseller so idk
[14:27:47] <MootPoot> maybe the OG website is different
[14:31:00] <MootPoot> I might do a preorder code thing for the 16gb model

[14:31:30] <MootPoot> and also now that I think about it - that ram will come in handy for virtualizing / docker
[14:31:43] <Bco1981> hmm probably should have bought a power plug too.

[16:54:52] <emmeka> JesseDesu something funny happened on Thursday. On the TV at work was olympic figure skating, and there was that Russian figure skater who's all controversial for having failed a doping test. So we were talking about that and how Russia doesn't get to compete under their own flag
[16:55:14] <emmeka> and this guy overhears us talking about Russians while looking at a TV, and runs up and says "did it happen, did the Russians invade?"
[16:55:25] <emmeka> and we were like nah man, it's just Russian figure skating...
[16:55:40] <JesseDesu> emmeka,
[16:56:08] <emmeka> void was very impatient.
[16:56:34] <HubertFarnsworth> I love FMA and FMAB volki57 
[16:56:38] <HubertFarnsworth> void*
[16:56:40] <DunceCotus> I figure skating is a part of it
[16:56:53] <Bco1981> HubertFarnsworth: he already left

[16:58:01] <JesseDesu> i sound like asakura from haruhi
[16:58:12] <HubertFarnsworth> how come there aren't many fma fans in here?
[16:58:34] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I mean everyone here has seen FMA, I assume.
[16:58:42] <emmeka> the answer is just that it's a very... basic? anime
[16:59:01] <JesseDesu> emmeka what do you think if russia and usa went nuclear
[16:59:11] <emmeka> one that most people of a certain age watched as one of their first serious anime
[17:00:38] <HubertFarnsworth> well the anime isn't special but the characters, story, music and all are good. It came of as one solid anime.
[17:01:08] <emmeka> saying you like FMA is like saying you like sex in the missionary position, it doesn't really need to be said as it is implicit and anyone who thinks their preference for it is actually worth talking about probably needs to broaden their horizons
[17:01:49] <HubertFarnsworth> well..
[17:02:28] <HubertFarnsworth> anyway I'd have suggested Baccano if that person was still here
[17:02:52] <emmeka> JesseDesu I think the US and Russia are the least likely to nuke each other of the nuclear powers.
[17:03:34] <emmeka> nobody cares about Kyiv enough to nuke anyone anyway
[17:04:52] <Bco1981> !later tell void < HubertFarnsworth> anyway I'd have suggested Baccano
[17:05:18] <JesseDesu> i keep having this fantasy of painless death by 450kiloton warhead
[17:05:37] <JesseDesu> and being at the epicenter of the blast
[17:06:22] <Bco1981> probably not painless. but will happen so fast that you won't comprehend the pain.
[17:06:46] <JesseDesu> what if you ride the bomb

[18:08:18] <amigojapan> emmeka: that's really strange. I guess there must be no clouds or something
[18:08:56] <emmeka> amigojapan those temperatures on the surface can only really happen due to inversion
[18:09:25] <emmeka> which is when the hot air from the ground rises and forms a layer in the atmosphere that traps colder air below it
[18:09:29] <amigojapan> Not sure what that is
[18:09:56] <amigojapan> emmeka: is there rain?
[18:10:03] <emmeka> inversion can't happen when there's clouds.
[18:10:11] <emmeka> the clouds otherwise block the hot air from rising
[18:10:13] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[18:10:22] <amigojapan> I see
[18:13:37] <emmeka> amigojapan you'll notice the effect clearly during spring frosts. Which always occur on nights with clear skies and no wind, causing inversion. If you're anywhere near a mountain or steep incline, you can usually visibly see it - a frost line ascending the slope, and then suddenly stopping midway
[18:14:42] <emmeka> amigojapan a problem though is that if the cap of inversion collapses and the two different air temps/pressures suddenly mix, it usually causes a massive storm.
[18:14:42] <amigojapan> emmeka: interesting
[18:15:18] <amigojapan> Snow storm?
[18:15:30] <emmeka> well, depending on the season, snow, maybe thunderstorm
[18:15:40] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[18:15:51] <emmeka> or freezing rain often
