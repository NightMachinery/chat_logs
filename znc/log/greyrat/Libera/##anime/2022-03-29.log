[00:33:42] <Berlin36> yeah

[00:33:46] <Berlin36> white pony
[00:33:47] <Berlin36> yes
[00:33:54] <JesseDesu> and what was the other one

[00:34:16] <JesseDesu> yes
[00:34:17] <Berlin36> yes
[00:34:37] <Berlin36> i can't say i have a favorite deftones music
[00:34:41] <JesseDesu> i saw him play when he had a side band
[00:34:41] <Berlin36> they're all so good
[00:34:48] <Berlin36> oh  cool
[00:35:01] <JesseDesu> i dont remember but it was 2004
[00:35:21] <Berlin36> i've listened to Crosses (it's a side project) and i thought it sounds so simillar to deftones, and after a few weeks i understood it is the same artist lol
[00:36:09] <Berlin36> i love the "Adrenaline" album, it's from 1995
[00:36:15] <JesseDesu> team sleep
[00:36:24] <JesseDesu> i saw team sleep 
[00:36:26] <Berlin36> it has Bored and One weak and Engine no.9
[00:36:48] <Berlin36> team sleep, lemme see
[00:37:07] <Sxem> i think it's because the CPU stops pushing samples to the sound card, and it just plays whatever is in the buffer in a loop.

[02:46:24] <hassoon> Fenderbassist: indeed
[02:46:54] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[02:47:00] <Fenderbassist> so at least it's for a good reason
[02:47:03] <Aeres> KatrinValerie: no issues at all, I understand. Take your time \o/

[02:50:07] <KatrinValerie> that was two years ago already
[02:50:39] <KatrinValerie> But things are a lot better, moving to a different town was a good decision.
[02:50:49] <Fenderbassist> hassoon: true, I've lived in New Jersey, Florida and now Arizona
[02:50:52] <hassoon> Fenderbassist: a california SF local moving to e.g new york is considered an expat imo

[02:50:57] <hassoon> indeed
[02:50:59] <KatrinValerie> The city I was living in before has an issue with fascists in the police force :/

[02:51:45] <KatrinValerie> When they noticed I was trans the cop just went and broke my nose like it was nothing and he even staged that I somehow resisted arrest...
[02:51:55] <KatrinValerie> Still can't believe how vile that person acted
[02:52:14] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: don't tell anybody about your trans situation
[02:52:37] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: if you do so, expect to be beaten or insulted or treated badly at the least
[02:52:40] <KatrinValerie> hassoon: it's not like I can really hide it
[02:52:54] <KatrinValerie> And I said nothing, I was just recognized as trans
[02:53:02] <hassoon> how is that
[02:53:24] <Fenderbassist> KatrinValerie: I'm really sorry to hear of that brutality
[02:54:06] <sentionics> I just handled an emergency situation while drunk as fuck
[02:54:13] <sentionics> I have truly gone mad
[02:54:24] <sentionics> I succeeded, but uh, damn.
[02:54:30] <hassoon> what happened
[02:54:31] <KatrinValerie> You don't have to be, but what you could do is oppose anti trans legislation in your state, that would honestly make me feel more safe than anything else
[02:54:32] <sentionics> I think I just lost 10 years
[02:54:43] <KatrinValerie> The situation in the USA scares me
[02:54:50] <sentionics> very serious client of ours, their site went down.
[02:55:01] <sentionics> I had to look at the error logs and debug
[02:55:01] <KatrinValerie> The political climate here is getting worse as well
[02:55:08] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: meh keep your trans behaviour in your home, when outdoors with society act like you're not a trans, train yourself to do like thta
[02:55:11] <sentionics> I figured it out, brought the site back up

[02:55:38] <Fenderbassist> that
[02:55:47] <KatrinValerie> hassoon: that is not a realistic option

[02:56:36] <KatrinValerie> That's not really how it works
[02:56:53] <KatrinValerie> When I pretended to be a dude I got beat up for not being masculine enough xD
[02:57:05] <KatrinValerie> So I couldn't really avoid the violence either way
[02:57:05] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: meh you should not mess with your gender that came naturally with you at birth anyway
[02:57:29] <Fenderbassist> KatrinValerie: so Germany is a very anti trans country?
[02:57:31] <KatrinValerie> hassoon: I think you are a little bit confused about these things.

[02:57:47] <Urchin[emacs]> hassoon: not everybody does
[02:57:58] <Cryowolf> sentionics, he could know and not give a shit as long as you're performing just fine. Cares more about results etc when you're working from home. Since you're not exactly at an office where HR is an issue

[03:00:03] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, people have various degrees of acceptance on these things. Some will vehemently oppose it, even calling for it to be illegal or whatnot. While others will go way overboard in the opposite direction, creating defacto discrimination against others instead of finding harmony. I think that as long as people let you do whatever the fuck you want with your own body and life without butting in on your business. That's 
[03:00:03] <Cryowolf> pretty much what's to expect
[03:00:13] <KatrinValerie> Fenderbassist: it is inane, in some instances I cannot come to any other conclusion than that the doctor wanted to cause harm. They prescribed a medication at a dosage of over %300 of the recommendations
[03:00:15] <sentionics> hi Cryowolf!
[03:00:27] <Aeres> Cryowolf: +
[03:01:13] <sentionics> Cryowolf, I agree with you. What I do with my body is my business.
[03:01:25] <sentionics> people trying to fix me, it's good intentions and all that.
[03:01:38] <sentionics> but, am I not free to choose my fate
[03:01:44] <Fenderbassist> KatrinValerie: yes that is very questionable behavior, any chance to change doctors?
[03:02:06] <KatrinValerie> Usually no, but you can always take less than what you are prescribed
[03:02:17] <Fenderbassist> sentionics: of course you are, it's just your friends want better for you
[03:02:25] <Fenderbassist> KatrinValerie: I see, ok
[03:02:25] <sentionics> I prescribe myself another round
[03:02:28] <KatrinValerie> in the end I had to learn the hard way that I had to read up on all of these things myself
[03:02:30] <sentionics> but...
[03:02:39] <Cryowolf> Personally, while I think it's a little weird. I can't shake that feeling. Probably because I don't know anyone IRL that's trans which would sort of normalize it for me. However  I fully support people who are trans to live their life and to feel as comfortable in their body as they can and in their life.
[03:02:45] <Fenderbassist> that is always a good thing, to be an informed patient
[03:02:47] <sentionics> Fenderbassist, you are my friend. You don't want me to suffer further, yes?
[03:02:52] <sentionics> hmmm
[03:02:54] <Cryowolf> I would never wish harm on anyone like that
[03:02:55] <KatrinValerie> actually did original research based on the DIY community as well and found the recommended dosage of a testosterone Blocker to be excessive still.

[03:04:18] <Cryowolf> I'm not saying it's the natural way, because obviously if you are born into the wrong body. There was an error somewhere

[03:04:48] <hassoon> Cryowolf: maybe one might have some behavioral patterns found often in the opposite sex.. i agree with that
[03:04:50] <Cryowolf> but that's why I don't think trying to "correct" that to feel more the gender you feel yourself to be is a bad thing
[03:05:08] <Cryowolf> no this has been established fact through scans of the brain etc
[03:05:38] <Cryowolf> people with gender dysmorphia (or w hatever it's called today)) have the brain structure of the opposite sex
[03:05:53] <Cryowolf> it's a medical re ality
[03:05:55] <Cryowolf> reality*
[03:06:13] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: Not quite that simple, since brains aren't strictly dimorphic across the sexes
[03:06:38] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, trying to simplify it for the sake of the conversation, or else we'll get into tangents and pedantism
[03:06:47] <KatrinValerie> I am pretty sure we won't get a complete or reasonable explanation in our lifetime
[03:07:36] <Cryowolf> If there was a pill that took away the sensation of "wrong", without taking away the sensation of self. Would you take it?
[03:07:37] <KatrinValerie> All I can say is that it's much easier for me to live as a woman
[03:08:17] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: that would be weird as it would change a lot about my self
[03:08:18] <Cryowolf> if you're happier, more content etc that way, then good on you. Keep doing it
[03:08:29] <hassoon> KatrinValerie: did you change your gentinals ?
[03:08:41] <hassoon>  genitals
[03:08:42] <hassoon> *
[03:09:06] <Cryowolf> Personally if there was a pill to fix the b rain circuits so my social ineptitude I get from aspergers goes away and I can be intuitively social. I would take it
[03:09:17] <Cryowolf> because then being social wouldn't be so so so so so draining
[03:09:24] <KatrinValerie> Yes, the surgery was a massive relief. But it's not really changing. Generally it's called gender affirming surgery these days. As you cannot really change sexes, only adapt your body to be closer to what you feel like.
[03:10:08] <Cryowolf> yeah, I think when trans people go "I HAD MY PERIOD!" I go "are you trying to fuck up the social progress by looking like a lunatic?"

[03:12:44] <Cryowolf> okay

[03:12:49] <Macer> with waver

[03:13:14] <KatrinValerie> not that I understand anything about them, but it's so clear they are there
[03:13:16] <Cryowolf> I wonder if there's a connection between autism and trans
[03:13:21] <Macer> it's not bad. but not much action in it. more of like.. if you took fate/stay night and turned it into sherlock holmes :)
[03:13:23] <Cryowolf> so many people who are trans are also autistic
[03:13:25] <Cryowolf> so so so many
[03:13:32] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I do not think there really is one
[03:13:47] <Cryowolf> so is it just a coincidence or is it that theyre the loudest ones?
[03:13:48] <KatrinValerie> It is more of a thing that we do not understand the social consequences, or are able to adapt as much.
[03:13:53] <Macer> i think the best action scenes in a fate series was babyloni
[03:13:55] <Cryowolf> and most o thers are just trying to get by in life?
[03:13:57] <Macer> babylonia*
[03:14:15] <Macer> i mean some of those fights are seriously overkill lol
[03:14:16] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I think an autistic person is simply more likely to realise that they are trans

[03:16:24] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I still wonder what the consequences would've been if I had attempted to transition in my teens
[03:16:50] <Cryowolf> testosterone wouldn't have masculanized your body and you'd have less androgen receptors
[03:16:51] <KatrinValerie> but alas, popular culture made me reconsider that
[03:17:14] <Cryowolf> your bone density would be lower
[03:17:17] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I meant social consequences, it is very likely that I would not have gotten access to blockers

[03:17:27] <Jigsy> Hello, okay.
[03:17:27] <Cryowolf> hmm
[03:17:28] <KatrinValerie> The hurdles would have been extremely high
[03:17:30] <Cryowolf> yeah I dunno

[03:17:54] <hassoon> i wanna hug a cat :|
[03:18:22] <Cryowolf> and at that age, you really don't know for sure yet. I mean some do, but so many others will think they are f or a short period of time and then go "nah, that was just for fun"
[03:18:41] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: the stats say different things
[03:18:58] <KatrinValerie> self-id is extremely accurate, even in the young

[03:19:25] <Cryowolf> if the feeling is persistent though
[03:19:26] <KatrinValerie> And you don't have to do anything when a young person wants to transition, that is usually just changing hair style or clothing and names

[03:21:25] <KatrinValerie> Forcing your kid into a different gender role than they feel at home with will be really noticeable

[03:22:05] <KatrinValerie> because they suffer from abuse
[03:22:10] <Cryowolf> the kid would act very different from how they're being dressed, try to c hange out of the clothes, maybe dirty them if they're a boy being forced to be a girl
[03:22:14] <Cryowolf> yeah
[03:22:20] <Cryowolf> I agree
[03:22:27] <KatrinValerie> It is honestly not the problem that people make it out to be, it's a strawmen against trans healthcare
[03:22:46] <KatrinValerie> Just like many many other talking points that are popular these days
[03:22:49] <Cryowolf> I haven't made it out to be a big problem though, I don't think. At least I didn't intend to
[03:23:41] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: it's just that you can always come up with scenarios in which there might be a negative outcome

[05:00:22] <Fenderbassist> just discord and zoom

[05:04:04] <Fenderbassist> I'm sure springtime in Japan is amazing
[05:04:42] <Fenderbassist> guess who's back amigojapan ?   Aeres
[05:04:54] <Cryowolf> I asked my oncologist to check my chart for the official measuring o f my cancer tumor. 43x37x28 cms and my spleen was enlarged to 22x15 cms
[05:05:09] <Cryowolf> the one they took out
[05:05:15] <Cryowolf> and weighed 11kgs of course
[05:05:22] <Aeres> hellllllllllows amigojapan \o/
[05:05:53] <Fenderbassist> Cryowolf: how are you these days?
[05:05:53] <amigojapan> oh Aeres!
[05:06:00] <Aeres> amigojapan: yay, sakura season was when I had first joined in too. 
[05:06:19] <Cryowolf> I'm horrible. I have a surgical hernia, my entire abdomen (belly button to ribcage) split under the skin
[05:06:29] <Cryowolf> so I need major surgery with meshes to stitch em together
[05:06:33] <amigojapan> ouch Cryowolf
[05:06:36] <Cryowolf> including navel hernia surgery
[05:06:37] <Fenderbassist> Cryowolf: oh my goodness
[05:06:59] <Cryowolf> its where they cut open in the first place
[05:07:03] <Cryowolf> but it didnt heal properly
[05:07:05] <Cryowolf> so pop
[05:07:38] <Fenderbassist> :(
[05:07:41] <Fenderbassist> I am so sorry man
[05:07:55] <Aeres> :( 
[05:08:01] <Cryowolf> thank you, it's not life threatening but it's painful and debilitating and the queue is long
[05:08:18] <Cryowolf> I got my risk of recesion (is that the word?) for my cancer, which is a 30% risk atm
[05:08:26] <Cryowolf> it will never go below 15-20% however
[05:08:30] <Fenderbassist> I see
[05:08:32] <Cryowolf> for reasons I won't go into
[05:08:41] <Fenderbassist> well we're all pullin for ya to get better
[05:08:42] <Cryowolf> so I'll live all my life with a 20% risk of death
[05:08:48] <Cryowolf> I will never recover -.-
[05:09:11] <Fenderbassist> or at least get to a manageable state that you aren't in so much pain
[05:09:16] <Cryowolf> not happy about that
[05:09:21] <Cryowolf> yeah I will get there eventually
[05:09:24] <Cryowolf> then return to the gym
[05:09:36] <Cryowolf> and slowly work my way back
[05:09:56] <Fenderbassist> yeah that's what I had to do with the spinal degeneration stuff
[05:10:05] <Fenderbassist> slow and steady wins the race
[05:11:15] <amigojapan> Aeres: how have you been?
[05:12:04] <Aeres> amigojapan: life have been sailing in the sea, tides and waves and calm and whales :P but thing is, the ship is good \p/ 
[05:12:06] <Cryowolf> Fenderbassist, except it wont kill you within a few months eh? :P
[05:12:19] <Cryowolf> if my cancer comes back it's very likely death
[05:12:30] <amigojapan> very  good Aeres
[05:12:34] <Aeres> hows life been for you? last time on freenode amigojapan you told me of otaku and then I joined and then there was no activity at all there so I left 
[05:13:22] <amigojapan> Aeres: we were in otaku channel for a while, and then we changed to here
[05:13:51] <amigojapan> Aeres: sorry you were lost
[05:14:09] <Fenderbassist> Cryowolf: that is very true, the most it would be for me is constant pain
[05:14:20] <Fenderbassist> but then again we never know what tomorrow will bring
[05:14:26] <Cryowolf> I'd rather live with constant pain tbh
[05:14:27] <Aeres> amigojapan: no worries, I returned and I am here where we belong
[05:14:31] <Cryowolf> as long as it isn't like
[05:14:43] <Cryowolf> pain of death level
[05:14:48] <Cryowolf> where I'm crying out in pain 24/7
[05:14:51] <Fenderbassist> the kind where they have to burn the nerves when it gets too bad
[05:15:03] <Fenderbassist> but I'm not there
[05:15:17] <Fenderbassist> that and the fibromyalgia take turns with the pain stuff
[05:15:23] <Cryowolf> I just want to get to the 15-20% area
[05:15:28] <Cryowolf> of risk
[05:15:30] <Fenderbassist> nerve, joint and muscle
[05:15:33] <Cryowolf> as good as it gets
[05:15:37] <Fenderbassist> yes I would love for you to be there
[05:15:39] <Cryowolf> fibro must suck
[05:15:46] <Fenderbassist> it does, there's no treatment
[05:15:54] <Fenderbassist> officially
[05:15:55] <Cryowolf> there's treatment, but no cure
[05:16:06] <Cryowolf> I mean technically there's treatment
[05:16:12] <Cryowolf> not for the condition but for the symptoms
[05:16:18] <Cryowolf> but not complete
[05:16:21] <Fenderbassist> that's faair
[05:16:25] <Fenderbassist> didn't do a thing for me :)
[05:16:26] <Cryowolf> only works halfway or so right?
[05:16:34] <Cryowolf> painkillers I mean
[05:16:39] <Fenderbassist> I never got painkillers
[05:16:50] <Fenderbassist> I did get Gabapentin and Lyrica but they were not helpful for me
[05:16:53] <Cryowolf> today my oncologist explained to me that methadone is both for neuropathic pain and nococeptive pain
[05:17:14] <Fenderbassist> oh really, I didn't know that
[05:17:28] <Cryowolf> neither did I
[05:17:30] <Fenderbassist> yeah I wouldn't take pain killers unless I was super bad
[05:17:46] <Cryowolf> it hits almost all opiate/opioid receptors + a few for neuropathic receptors
[05:17:51] <Fenderbassist> interesting
[05:17:52] <Cryowolf> I take oxycodone daily
[05:17:59] <Cryowolf> I was offered methadone
[05:18:01] <Cryowolf> but turned it down
[05:18:06] <Fenderbassist> I see
[05:18:26] <Fenderbassist> I'm glad you can get something
[05:18:29] <Fenderbassist> for relief
[05:18:36] <Fenderbassist> I don't know how well it works for you
[05:18:46] <Cryowolf> it works fine. Thats why I didnt want methadone
[05:18:52] <Cryowolf> no reason to take a stronger painkiller
[05:18:55] <Cryowolf> if the current one works
[05:18:56] <Fenderbassist> but I'm glad you're not in another friend's situation of chronic pancriatitis and can't get even pain killers
[05:19:01] <Fenderbassist> yeah true
[05:19:26] <Fenderbassist> he's in Tennessee and they won't prescribe a thing
[05:19:30] <Cryowolf> they cut a piece of my pancreas off :P
[05:19:33] <Fenderbassist> cause of the governor I think?
[05:19:39] *** Quits: Jigsy (~Jigsy@user/jigsy) (Quit: bbiaf.)
[05:19:45] <Cryowolf> really? Overreaction to the opioid crisis?
[05:19:54] <Fenderbassist> governor's kid died in opioid crisis
[05:19:56] <Fenderbassist> yeah
[05:20:13] <Fenderbassist> so now no one apparently can
[05:20:24] <Fenderbassist> at whatever level he's witnessed
[05:20:38] <Cryowolf> its incredibly hard to die from JUST opioids/opiates
[05:20:47] <Cryowolf> you'd have to take insane amounts of OD
[05:20:49] <Cryowolf> and even then
[05:21:01] <Fenderbassist> yeah I don't know the details, I'll guess he mixed pills and booze?
[05:21:02] <Cryowolf> it's from combination that you die
[05:21:07] <Cryowolf> that would do it
[05:21:21] <Fenderbassist> is my best guess

[05:22:50] <Cryowolf> but as long as Im responsible

[05:22:56] <Fenderbassist> right
[05:23:19] <Cryowolf> stick to my dose etc
[05:23:26] <Fenderbassist> yeah never mess with those

[05:31:01] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: such medicines are called kanpo  in Japanese
[05:31:10] <Fenderbassist> oh it's a category
[05:31:15] <Fenderbassist> and not a specific
[05:31:17] <amigojapan> yup
[05:31:20] <Fenderbassist> ok
[05:31:55] <Fenderbassist> with my luck, I"ll go to an herbal shop here, ask for kanpo, get a kenpo punch in the face and be asked "how does that feel now?" lol
[05:32:16] <amigojapan> lol Fenderbassist
[05:32:50] <Fenderbassist> then I'll say "I didn't mean that!" which will be followed by a kendo wooden sword swat on my head
[05:33:01] <Aeres> rofl 
[05:33:10] <amigojapan> lol Fenderbassist
[05:33:19] <Fenderbassist> oh wow, Amazon has a ton of entries for Kanpo products
[05:33:28] <Fenderbassist> cleaning teas
[05:33:32] <Fenderbassist> barley drinks
[05:33:33] <Fenderbassist> etc.
[05:33:42] <amigojapan> I see
[05:34:36] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: the word "kanpo" is probably not regulated outside of Japan nwo that I think of it
[05:35:16] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: most kampo medicine comes in powder form and is quite bitter

[05:37:33] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: last night when I was skyping with senti, my battery refused to charge, it seems it wont charge when the phone is hot
[05:37:52] <Fenderbassist> is that typical of cell phones?
[05:38:00] <amigojapan> once it cooled down it started charging again
[05:38:12] <Fenderbassist> maybe it's a safety feature
[05:38:14] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: this is the first phone that ever did that to me
[05:38:17] <Fenderbassist> I see
[05:38:54] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I think it may be cuase this phone has "fast cahrging" which is super fast, but also it causes the phone ot get very hot

[05:47:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I hate fast charging now
[05:49:54] * amigojapan has an appointment at the dentist today
[05:50:43] <amigojapan> one of my fillings came out, Iwonder if they can make it into a root cannal instead
[05:51:12] <amigojapan> with a metalic cap, that woudl be best for me, I think
[05:52:07] <amigojapan> not need to worry about it anymore
[05:53:12] <Aeres> amigojapan: is it a molar or premolar? 
[05:53:54] <amigojapan> Aeres: think it is molar, but I dont really know the diffeerence
[05:54:25] <Aeres> mostly the closer it is to the end of mouth (6,7 or 8,9) the easier it is to get the cap fillings
[05:54:33] <Aeres> I got like a bridge for myself and a cap 
[05:55:15] <amigojapan> Aeres: this is like the most important tooth, the one right in the middle
[05:55:42] <amigojapan> I will ask the dentist if he can put a cap on it, if he can, that is what I want
[05:55:43] <Aeres> aha! fillings came out, so try to get a ceramic cap 
[05:55:53] <Aeres> ceramic cap match the color of the teeth and are more comfy 
[05:55:59] <amigojapan> Aeres: I preffeer metalic
[05:56:12] <Aeres> the metallic ones if not done properly have a bad case of swelling and pus creation underneath 
[05:56:14] <amigojapan> Aeres: metalic seems more durable
[05:56:47] <Aeres> not really, as long as you are not eating stones they are both same, the thing is metallic ones are visible which makes it look weird 
[05:56:59] <Aeres> then the pus and reactions are also possible 
[05:57:02] <amigojapan> Aeres: my dentist also still uses an XP computer in his dentist chair ;/
[05:57:30] <amigojapan> Aeres: I dont care about it being visible
[05:57:49] <Aeres> yes same, but the risk of pus is kinda nasty 
[05:57:59] <Aeres> it happened in my sister's case and was painful 
[05:58:05] <Aeres> metallic ones are cheaper tho
[05:58:39] <amigojapan> Aeres: in Japan dental is covered by the government, so price is not that much of a factor

[05:59:24] <amigojapan> ok Aeres
[05:59:32] <Aeres> ahh also, amigojapan it might be specific for your teeth case, then go with metallic 
[05:59:56] <Aeres> like I had my premolars removed and my wisdom tooth replaced molar (molars slid in place of pre molars) 
[05:59:59] <amigojapan> Aeres: alright, I will ask
[06:00:11] <Aeres> there wasnt much of my tooth left for capping 
[06:00:39] <Aeres> so the metallic was ideal for it 
[06:00:55] <amigojapan> I see Aeres
[06:01:19] <Aeres> afk now, gotta take a bath 
[06:01:43] <amigojapan> Aeres: one problem with this dentist is that he does not sit down with me to plan the surgery, it is all planned very quickly on the spot

[06:39:30] <ButterNoodle> and they are all older
[06:40:03] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I don't like this dentist, he does not give me enough time to think what I want
[06:40:30] <ButterNoodle> ahh, dentistry is just about fixing teeth.. not options
[06:41:29] <ButterNoodle> probably just re-drill and fill if no root issues
[06:41:46] <ButterNoodle> I'd never volunteer for a root canal
[06:42:06] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: that probably means it will happen again next year
[06:42:19] <ButterNoodle> cosmetic crowns seem to be a thing here.. since they cost about $800.. most of that the patient pays
[06:42:38] <ButterNoodle> have u had a root canal?
[06:42:57] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: cost is not a big concern in Japan. Since the government pays 
[06:43:07] <ButterNoodle> yep.. that makes it ez
[06:43:48] <amigojapan> Yeah
[06:43:54] <ButterNoodle> oof
[06:44:15] <ButterNoodle> I've not had a root canal.. and from talking to people that have - never want
[06:44:39] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I have had several
[06:44:50] <ButterNoodle> do they drug you good?
[06:44:59] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: it hurts but it is a very permanent fix
[06:45:14] <amigojapan> Not good enough in Japan 
[06:45:31] <ButterNoodle> very true, the only thing more permanent is an implant
[06:45:35] <amigojapan> They only use novacaine 
[06:45:53] <ButterNoodle> I think thats all they do here tbh..

[08:13:12] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: they arent buying ramen in a san fran 711
[08:13:17] <BillyZane> i've been reading 'my dress-up darling' (manga)

[08:15:41] <ButterNoodle> I want a cosplaying gyru ;_;
[08:15:55] <BillyZane> very little to complain about the show
[08:16:24] <amigojapan> hey BillyZane and MootPoot
[08:16:28] <ButterNoodle> yea.. only complaint is that I'm not the one giving marin a piggy back ride
[08:16:34] <ButterNoodle> :<
[08:16:37] <BillyZane> my problem though is.. i think it would have been good if kitagawa wasn't so beautiful. it almost ruins it
[08:16:52] * ButterNoodle opens the door and puts BillyZane out with the trash
[08:16:54] <amigojapan> MootPoot: fast charge fucked up on me
[08:17:04] <MootPoot> wat
[08:17:21] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan is mad... dropping the F bomb
[08:17:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you know how the phone gets hot when it charges on fast charge?
[08:17:32] <MootPoot>  yes?
[08:17:35] <amigojapan> lol ButterNoodle
[08:17:35] <BillyZane> i think the show took great pains to frame gojo's motives, which appear to be entirely driven by her actions, and the things she said, and not her beauty
[08:17:57] <BillyZane> which is a great thing, it needed to be there
[08:18:10] <BillyZane> but why does she have to be so beautiful to get our love
[08:18:12] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: I'd rather jack off to a beauty than a fattie
[08:18:13] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I was trying to charge while using the phone hevily last night, and it refused to charge cuase the phone was hot

[08:18:41] <MootPoot> if your phone is too hot it wont slow charge either
[08:18:50] <BillyZane> the show would have been better if she was ordinary looking, instead she has to be this model
[08:18:59] <amigojapan> hmmm ok MootPoot
[08:19:14] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think it is a failsafe
[08:19:28] <MootPoot> if your phone is water resistant you can just wet it really quick 
[08:19:45] <MootPoot> or just let it chill for a little bit
[08:19:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot: hmmm, ok, that is a good idea

[08:21:24] <amigojapan> ok
[08:22:07] <MootPoot> the main thing I miss about going keto is not having rice and beans anymore

[08:22:11] <MootPoot> I love beans
[08:23:00] <amigojapan> MootPoot: beans are good

[08:26:44] <BillyZane> i soak it and boil it in a pot, then smash it with a masher
[08:27:16] <BillyZane> and then in another pan, melt a bunch of butter, add onion and garlic to it, and then a bunch of chili powder
[08:27:32] <BillyZane> and let that cook. then add that to the beans
[08:27:39] <amigojapan> oh man you are making me hungry
[08:27:52] <BillyZane> amigojapan, it's so good. i would eat that in the morning with tortillas and avocado
[08:27:55] <BillyZane> i can also have some eggs with it

[09:42:50] <MootPoot> but the min I could accept from a EV bike is around 300 personally....
[09:42:58] <ButterNoodle> davic knows a good benis when he sees it
[09:42:59] <MootPoot> 300 is like 2.5 hours of riding
[09:43:08] <ButterNoodle> yep
[09:43:28] <ButterNoodle> just get a fast pedal bike
[09:43:38] <ButterNoodle> fuel for that is green

[09:43:52] <MootPoot> no job

[09:44:29] <ButterNoodle> yep
[09:44:44] <ButterNoodle> well the "miles until empty" is accurate in mine
[09:44:53] <ButterNoodle> actually in all the fords I've had
[09:44:57] <MootPoot> same with mine too really
[09:45:06] <ButterNoodle> the mpg is always wrong
[09:45:09] <MootPoot> the miles until empty fucks up if I go too high up in alt

[09:48:20] <S_T_A_N> I was picturing 5 figures 
[09:48:31] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: you got me hooked on merino wool
[09:48:33] <MootPoot> shit's amazing
[09:48:37] <MootPoot> expensive
[09:48:38] <MootPoot> but
[09:48:43] <ButterNoodle> shouldnt be that much... just a fancy plug on a fancy pole
[09:48:53] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea its real fucking nice
[09:48:56] <S_T_A_N> CO is a Right to charge state so HoA is limited in how much it can fuck with it
[09:49:07] <MootPoot> I ordered a 80% merino base layer
[09:49:11] <ButterNoodle> nice
[09:49:21] <ButterNoodle> S_T_A_N will concrete need to be chipped?
[09:49:30] <ButterNoodle> thats $$$
[09:49:36] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, yeah but running thee electricity and whatever needs to be done to make sure it's metered right. 
[09:49:46] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, most likely
[09:49:59] <ButterNoodle> *a few thousand then
[09:50:04] <ButterNoodle> no garage in the condo?
[09:50:13] <ButterNoodle> ig that would be a townhome
[09:50:35] <S_T_A_N> So we have a small ish lot. My spot is sort of in the middle of it.
[09:50:55] <ButterNoodle> and where is ur breaker box? probably in the back of the condo
[09:51:07] <S_T_A_N> yeah if I had a town home this would not even be a convo. 
[09:51:20] <S_T_A_N> ButterNoodle, This is like a real condo building. Think like a hotel
[09:51:36] <ButterNoodle> copper is expensive.. $1000 would cover wire from the panel to.. say a plug on the front of the condo
[09:52:10] <ButterNoodle> chip concrete.. have to have some fancy post and socket to meet hoa.. I mean under 10L
[09:52:13] <ButterNoodle> 10K
[09:52:13] <S_T_A_N> Just for the copper, not for the labor and having to deal with the digging
[09:52:16] <ButterNoodle> maybe 5L
[09:52:19] <ButterNoodle> maybe 5k
[09:52:46] <ButterNoodle> well not digging.. pulling copper through the place and putting the outlet on the exterior wall
[09:52:54] <ButterNoodle> dirt is ez
[09:52:58] <S_T_A_N> There is no wall lo.
[09:53:09] <S_T_A_N> I am in the middle of the parking lot
[09:53:20] <S_T_A_N> It's not like my space is right up to a wall or something
[09:53:48] <ButterNoodle> that could be $$$
[09:53:58] <ButterNoodle> they should offer charging stations :)
[09:56:06] <S_T_A_N> Wish I could have been there to suggest it when they were still early enough in construction to do it. They might have take to the idea given the kind of mindset this was being built with
[09:59:32] <S_T_A_N> this is a rough idea of what my building looks like. The black is the building. The red is the parking(some of it is covered). The Green is my spot

[10:34:01] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I did but that only accounts for exact sizes, not how it "feels" to wear
[10:34:10] <thiccdaddy> if you haven't masturbated to 2D women, you do not belong here The_Blode 
[10:34:22] <The_Blode> I have the classics, My Neighbour Totoro, I have Bleach, I have Cowboy Bebop etc.
[10:34:33] <The_Blode> Does Jessica Rabbit count?
[10:34:36] <thiccdaddy> lol
[10:34:39] <thiccdaddy> The_Blode++
[10:34:39] <amigojapan> The_Blode: there is perfectly wholesome anime too 
[10:34:39] <sentionics> I've beaten off just for the sake of beating off. No further stimuli. You nerds need to get on my level.
[10:34:57] <thiccdaddy> those kind of faps are just pure depression faps bro

[10:35:28] <sentionics> dopamine dream
[10:35:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: right. You need to go to brick and mortar shops for that
[10:35:33] <thiccdaddy> i can't tell if The_Blode is a troll is genuinely like this
[10:35:42] <thiccdaddy> either way he's cool, youre in grandpa

[10:36:16] <The_Blode> It was her voice too.
[10:36:30] <The_Blode> Honestly...I get Hilary vibes from the voice (only a little)
[10:36:31] <MootPoot> amigojapan: sadly for what I want the brick shops dont have it
[10:36:36] <MootPoot> they only have the popular or cheap stuff
[10:36:59] <sentionics> The_Blode: mate. Don't let nerds here tell you what you should watch. Want to watch good shit. Well, most anime is shit.
[10:37:01] <amigojapan> The_Blode: did your heart come out of your body? And y your eyes turn into hearts?
[10:37:18] <The_Blode> Plus...I have to get my hair cut in a few weeks...at my hairdressers house. She's a beautiful Japanese woman and I am scared shotless...because she has kindly asked me to do the Japanese tradition thing and I feel self concious.
[10:37:21] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot 
[10:37:22] <sentionics> There are good ones, but a lot of not good shit you have to go through to find it
[10:37:35] <thiccdaddy> The_Blode: watch KissXSis and report back immediately soldier
[10:37:39] <The_Blode> I'm just trying to get into anime...so beginning with the classics.
[10:37:41] <sentionics> The_Blode: have you watched Space Dandy?
[10:37:45] <MootPoot> boku no pico
[10:37:53] <sentionics> MootPoot: don't be mean.
[10:38:07] <thiccdaddy> the classics, have you seen any ghbli's The_Blode ?
[10:38:08] <The_Blode> It's the first cut at her house.
[10:38:18] <The_Blode> I haven't. My hairdresser recommended that though.
[10:38:24] <amigojapan> The_Blode: please watch sailor moon. That is my favourite classic
[10:38:29] <thiccdaddy> Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle are musts
[10:38:31] <thiccdaddy> top tier
[10:38:32] <The_Blode> Yeah I've heard of that one.
[10:38:36] <thiccdaddy> start with those 3
[10:38:39] <The_Blode> I have Princess Mononoke.
[10:38:44] <sentionics> The_Blode: Please watch Space Dandy. It will reallign your universe.
[10:38:53] <The_Blode> I'll see if I can find that thank you.
[10:38:53] <thiccdaddy> .g space dandy
[10:39:05] <thiccdaddy> can i get a tl;dr on space dandy?
[10:39:10] <The_Blode> So what you guys suggest if you got your hair cut at a Japanese woman's house?
[10:39:12] <sentionics> no. you cannot.
[10:39:18] <thiccdaddy> ლ(ಥ Д ಥ )ლ
[10:39:21] <sentionics> you cannot tldr space dandy, you heathen.
[10:39:51] <thiccdaddy> i've been binging naruto 
[10:40:05] <thiccdaddy> call me a narutard all you want, but i'm gonna be the next hokage
[10:40:15] <sentionics> I should slap you with a "believe it" exploding tag.
[10:40:19] <amigojapan> The_Blode: say 髪の毛を切りになってもらって誠に感謝します
[10:40:29] <thiccdaddy> lol
[10:40:51] <thiccdaddy> The_Blode: the original Berserk anime is a must too
[10:40:54] <thiccdaddy> uhhh
[10:40:55] <The_Blode> She has asked me to take my shoes off...and I have anxiety that my feet might smell. So I've got some sprays and powder to help on the day.
[10:41:08] <thiccdaddy> bro
[10:41:14] <thiccdaddy> assert dominance 
[10:41:16] <sentionics> thiccdaddy, I thoroughly agree. Berzerk is an amazing anime.
[10:41:37] <The_Blode> Assert my smelly dominance?
[10:41:43] <thiccdaddy> yeah
[10:41:47] <sentionics> The other berzerks are not real, but you may peruse them if you are morbidly curious in how a good story can be done wrong.
[10:41:48] <The_Blode> In someone else's house?
[10:41:52] <thiccdaddy> yeah!
[10:42:06] <The_Blode> In a beautiful ladies' house?
[10:42:25] <thiccdaddy> OH YEAH
[10:42:33] <sentionics> look, I don't smell. It's just my body's natural scent.
[10:42:40] <amigojapan> The_Blode: you could take fresh socks with you
[10:43:07] <sentionics> also, I don't wear a shirt, so I don't need to sweat.
[10:43:08] <The_Blode> I was thinking of washing my feet and changing my socks just prior to going to her house. I'm not used to getting services rendered in someone's home...usually we go to a shop.
[10:43:24] <thiccdaddy> how old are you The_Blode ? if you don't mind my asking
[10:43:41] <The_Blode> "ASL?" lol
[10:43:44] <sentionics> I feel like... I need to slow it down a minute. brb
[10:43:46] <The_Blode> I am 34 years young. You?
[10:43:51] <thiccdaddy> 12
[10:43:54] <DunceCotus> I feel like Berzerk kinda dumped a whole lot of supernatural weirdness on us at the last minute
[10:44:02] <DunceCotus> still a great anime
[10:44:07] <amigojapan> The_Blode: I'm 44
[10:44:15] <The_Blode> Coo
[10:44:16] <The_Blode> l
[10:44:32] <thiccdaddy> sentionics: yeah I had the memes full throttled for too long
[10:45:09] <amigojapan> The_Blode: revolutionary girl utena is also a great classic from the 90s
[10:45:22] <amigojapan> The_Blode: and evangelion 
[10:45:30] <thiccdaddy> oh, evangelion is a must
[10:46:33] <sentionics> thiccdaddy, no worries mate. I have relieved myself and back in action.
[10:46:59] <thiccdaddy> 賢者タイムだね
[10:47:09] <sentionics> my bladder called me a bitch as I was walking out the bathroom though. >_>
[10:47:14] <amigojapan> The_Blode: after you watch evangelion watch a video called "the lore of evangelion" by a YouTuber called otakudaikun
[10:47:49] <sentionics> hi amigo

[10:49:43] <sentionics> I had the white chocolate and strawberry flavour one, it was good. It came in a mason jar too, so you know it's good.
[10:49:46] <The_Blode> Is it common for guys on IRC to drink a lot?
[10:49:55] <sentionics> no, it's just me.
[10:50:05] <The_Blode> I've only been on the platform for about a year now and still learning about the culture.
[10:50:09] <amigojapan> Not that much The_Blode 
[10:50:10] <sentionics> I'm the token channel drunk.
[10:50:49] <sentionics> ask amigo if you're curious, most of us aren't drunks. It's mostly just me and maybe sometimes a few others get hammered sometimes.

[11:06:44] <Zoidberg> I don't remember who but if you shorten a sentence to a single word, Japanese would understand English. Like if you want to ask for metro station, instead of asking, "where is metro station?" just say "metro station"
[11:07:54] <Zoidberg> The_Blode: can't resist asking, who?
[11:08:01] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: eki ha doko desu ka
[11:08:17] <The_Blode> She's my hairdresser.
[11:09:03] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: eki is railway station so I guess where is railway station?

[11:09:27] <amigojapan> Correct Zoidberg 
[11:09:49] <Zoidberg> yeah but when I write I should write it as ha right?
[11:10:04] <Zoidberg> but yeah, I remember that amigojapan 
[11:10:26] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: in Japanese yes, but it romaji there is no convention
[11:10:41] <Zoidberg> nice mate, are you from UK The_Blode? I love everything british.

[11:11:52] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: I know eki and doko in that sentence, guessing the remaining
[11:12:12] <Zoidberg> doko means where 
[11:12:22] <MootPoot> kanojo doko
[11:12:38] <amigojapan> Zoidberg in informal Japanese you can just say "eki doko?"
[11:12:53] <Zoidberg> oh, that's nice
[11:13:10] <Zoidberg> just knowing the basic things is helpful
[11:13:36] <amigojapan> Yup
[11:14:00] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it seems that if you make coffee carefully you can even make black coffee not bitter
[11:14:11] <amigojapan> Zoidberg toire ha doko desu ka? Is extremly important
[11:14:15] <Zoidberg> another basic phrase I remember is asking people what's that in eglish amigojapan 
[11:14:25] <Zoidberg> "eigo te iu no wa..."

[12:00:27] <Zoidberg> talking about footwear, amigojapan, do you know most people pronounce Nike the wrong way
[12:01:31] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I did not think it was a Japanese word
[12:01:41] <Zoidberg> what if they aren't much fan of kids Nanobot?
[12:02:03] <Zoidberg> not Japanese amigojapan, just saying
[12:02:18] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: Nike origins are from Greek
[12:02:24] <amigojapan> Ah ok Zoidberg 
[12:03:02] <amigojapan> Zoidberg I pronounce it like ナイキー

[12:04:13] <Nanobot> Nike is actually pronounced "neika"
[12:04:29] <Nanobot> I pronounced it that way just now, so I'm not lying.
[12:06:02] <Nanobot> According to Wikipedia, the Nike in Greek mythology is pronounced the same way most people pronounce the company.

[12:10:55] <Zoidberg> depends on podcast and also on their sources and research team

[13:21:09] <MootPoot> failing
[13:21:23] <senti> MootPoot, sounds like you're going at it all wrong.
[13:21:31] <senti> but I don't know what you're doing tbh
[13:21:35] <The_Blode> Black Hole Sun...won't you come
[13:21:41] <MootPoot> just normal leetcode stuff etc
[13:21:44] <MootPoot> trying to git gud
[13:21:48] <The_Blode> I didn't think this would be a channel where trolls lived though.
[13:21:48] <MootPoot> so I can git --job
[13:21:55] <senti> man, that's where you are fucking up
[13:22:03] <The_Blode> SVN ftw
[13:22:07] <senti> fuck that l33t code shit.
[13:22:21] <senti> MootPoot, stop doing dumbass excercises like that.
[13:22:37] <MootPoot> Do what instead
[13:22:50] <senti> How's about you work your brain a little and think of something you'd like to make. Build that. Now that's an exercise.
[13:23:12] <senti> me personally, I loved to make games. I made games. That made me good.
[13:23:27] <The_Blode> Did you get them published on CD ROMs?
[13:23:28] <senti> Not dumbass exercises "cool kids" espoused
[13:23:33] <senti> hell no
[13:23:40] <senti> my games are mine.
[13:23:50] <The_Blode> Oh
[13:23:50] <MootPoot> but that's what they keep asking for them to actually get a job
[13:23:55] <MootPoot> every time I apply and get a call back
[13:24:00] <MootPoot> "please do this code test"
[13:24:09] <senti> I love code tests.
[13:24:18] <senti> I shit on that stuff so easy.
[13:24:31] <MootPoot> yeah, I dont
[13:24:35] <MootPoot> takes me a while
[13:24:39] <senti> thing is, when you do what you love long enough, dumbass shit like that doesn't phase you
[13:24:57] <senti> you need to start doing what you want to do
[13:24:58] <MootPoot> half the time I'm just confused on what the question wants tbh
[13:25:03] <senti> code something fun, MootPoot.
[13:25:12] <senti> don't think about it. Do it. Now.
[13:25:24] <MootPoot> what is...fun
[13:25:31] <senti> Only thoughts in your head should be, what shall I make.
[13:25:37] <senti> Make it.
[13:25:52] <The_Blode> Code what exactly? What are the requirements?
[13:25:54] <senti> MootPoot, only you can say what is fun. Don't ask others for that.
[13:25:56] <The_Blode> Or just go nuts with it.
[13:26:06] <senti> go nuts, mofo
[13:26:18] <senti> wth, this coding
[13:26:23] <The_Blode> Fun is enjoying listening to Voliminal snippets from the grandmaster James Donald Root
[13:26:30] <senti> coding should be nuts out in the wind.
[13:26:54] <senti> can you code that in an even greater way? I bet you can!
[13:27:05] <The_Blode> Fun is archiving thousands of files with Peazip and watching the progress bar.
[13:27:19] <senti> uh. you... do you.
[13:27:28] <The_Blode> Thank you :) I am a simple man with simple pleasures.
[13:27:43] <The_Blode> Progress bars do it for me.
[13:27:46] <senti> I like that. You're alright, Blode.
[13:27:59] <The_Blode> Love seeing the progress bar going to 100%
[13:28:05] <The_Blode> Thanks senti.
[13:28:29] <senti> You're making me have flash backs to downloading porn images on my old dial up internet as a kid.
[13:28:32] <The_Blode> I have thousands of dollars in the bank but nothing to spend it on and nobody to share it with.
[13:28:38] <The_Blode> I'm happy with my simple existence though.
[13:28:55] <The_Blode> I felt dial up made us appreciate downloaded things much more...at least in my case.
[13:29:15] <senti> it really did!
[13:29:37] <senti> I was so damn ecstatic that time I downloaded this clip of Cody Lane, she was hot as hell dancing nude.
[13:29:49] <The_Blode> Oh
[13:29:50] <senti> anyway, that was... uh, too much information I guess.
[13:30:00] <The_Blode> It's all good. It's what you like. You do you.
[13:30:09] <senti> Thanks mate.
[13:30:23] <senti> I'm a guy, btw, sorry if I didn't say that before.
[13:30:47] <The_Blode> That's all good.
[13:30:48] <senti> I also generally don't wear a shirt, but sometimes I do.
[13:30:55] <senti> it happens.
[13:30:57] <The_Blode> Is Cody a man or a lady?
[13:31:11] <The_Blode> Oh she*
[13:31:13] <The_Blode> My bad
[13:31:29] <senti> Cody is a name that is available for both genders
[13:31:40] <senti> but in my experience it's usually for guys.
[13:31:53] <senti> it throws me off when women are named that, but they are sometimes.
[13:32:04] <senti> Cody Lane in this case is a woman.
[13:32:09] <senti> a very hot woman.
[13:32:29] <The_Blode> Jamie is another one I can think of.
[13:32:35] <senti> from what I've read about her though, she's off the wall levels of crazy though.
[13:32:40] <The_Blode> Rusty.
[13:32:58] <The_Blode> Jeremy spoke in class today.
[13:33:27] <senti> anyway, afk for a bit
[13:33:31] <senti> later mate
[13:33:36] <The_Blode> Take care man
[13:33:41] <senti> you too

[13:58:02] <amigojapan> hey guys
[13:58:08] <amigojapan> and gals
[13:58:18] <ketchupicecream> hey amigojapan 
[13:58:27] <ketchupicecream> did it hurt?
[13:58:35] <MootPoot> was she cute
[13:58:44] <amigojapan> hey there ketchupicecream
[13:58:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the dentist?
[13:58:59] <ketchupicecream> asking the real questions
[13:59:57] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: it did not hurt at all, but he told me to ocme back next week too
[14:00:26] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: the dentist was about to do it withought using novacaine tho, that would have hurt
[14:02:29] <ketchupicecream> woah
[14:02:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the dentist is a guy, about my own age, and he uses windows XP on his dental chair software, but it is not connected to the internet
[14:03:22] <MootPoot> lol
[14:03:24] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: yeah, what an asshole, I know
[14:03:38] <MootPoot> yeah a lot of those systems are still running XP 
[14:03:49] <MootPoot> my dentist's place also uses XP afaik
[14:03:59] <amigojapan> MootPoot: he has lots of specialised software on XP
[14:05:18] <amigojapan> damn, now my whole lip is numb, I guess that is normal hehehe
[14:11:20] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: I asked him if he could give that tooth a root cannal and put on a metalic cap, but he said that would be "a waste of a good tooth", I super need this tooth, cause Ilack a tooth on the other side of the mouth and can only chew with that side
[14:14:53] <ketchupicecream> dang dude. what are the alternatives?
[14:15:28] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: he just re-did the filling that had fallen out
[14:16:24] <ketchupicecream> oh
[14:17:20] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: eventho root cannal is more expensive, Japanese government insurance covers dental
[14:17:39] <amigojapan> so money is not a concern
[14:18:39] <ketchupicecream> nice 
[14:18:46] <amigojapan> :)
[14:18:57] <ketchupicecream> we have insurance here, but it doesn't cover outpatient procedures :/
[14:19:07] <amigojapan> every country shoudl cover dental and glasses
[14:19:15] <ketchupicecream> government insurance i mean
[14:19:34] <amigojapan> !c outpatient
[14:19:35] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: An outpatient department or outpatient clinic is the part of a hospital designed for the treatment of outpatients, people with health problems who visit the hospital for diagnosis or treatment, but do not at this time require a bed or to be admitted for overnight care.
[14:20:07] <amigojapan> ouch ketchupicecream
[14:20:14] <ketchupicecream> yeah
[14:20:22] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: in Japan they cover outpatient and medicine too
[14:21:07] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: most people need to pay 30% some pay 10% there is some fee for most tho'
[14:21:30] <amigojapan> the rest is paid by teh goverment
[14:21:30] <amigojapan> ]
[14:21:57] <ketchupicecream> great
[14:22:10] <amigojapan> yup yup
[14:23:33] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: they cover psychiotrist too, but not psychologists...
[14:26:31] <ketchupicecream> so you need to get a little madder
[14:27:42] <amigojapan> hehehe, not sure, I tried taking a few psychologist appointments by paint for it by myself, but I did not feel it would help so I gave up on that, I cant afford to go for years like some people do
[14:27:58] <amigojapan> I guess I would go if it were covered
[14:28:11] <Sapphirus> Canada is going to be implementing public dental insurance
[14:28:20] <Sapphirus> As well as public pharmacare
[14:28:27] <amigojapan> fantastic Sapphirus, and hi
[14:28:32] <Sapphirus> hello
[14:29:04] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: good it will be like Japan then
[14:29:44] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: Japan also offers glasses, but they are hospital glasses so you cant pick a frame
[14:30:08] <amigojapan> if you dont care about how it looks, they are covered
[14:30:12] <Sapphirus> Yeah, we have no vision care here.
[14:30:19] <amigojapan> ouch
[14:31:09] <amigojapan> I dont wear glasses tho, eventho i am 44 yo
[14:31:30] <amigojapan> they say I need glasses, but I can still see withought them
[14:31:36] <Sapphirus> I do and have been since I was in grade school.
[14:31:46] <amigojapan> 'ah
[14:33:37] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: how old are you in "grade school"?
[14:33:49] <amigojapan> is that elementry school?
[14:33:51] <Sapphirus> Elementary school age, so like <=13
[14:34:11] <amigojapan> ah ok, so like elementry school + middle school, I see
[14:34:23] <amigojapan> on no just elementry school
[14:34:25] <amigojapan> I see
[14:34:39] <Sapphirus> We didn't have middle school. Grade 1-8 was in the same school.

[14:35:59] <amigojapan> ah
[14:36:52] <Sapphirus> 8 years in elementary and 4 years in high school
[14:37:06] <amigojapan> ah, I see
[14:37:36] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: does it feel humiliating to be in teh same school as small kids at such an age? or maybe that just feels normal?
[14:38:05] <Sapphirus> It was normalised, so I didn't look at it that way.
[14:38:16] <amigojapan> ah ok good
[14:38:45] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: is highschool considered "obligatory education"?
[14:38:50] <amigojapan> its not in Japan
[14:38:57] <Sapphirus> yes.
[14:39:02] <amigojapan> ah, nice
[14:40:11] <ketchupicecream> i remember carpooling with a bunch of kids
[14:40:17] <ketchupicecream> man that was embarassing
[14:40:37] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I have mixed feelings about "obligatory education" while it is the best option for most people, it definitely was not for me, as I did something completly different
[14:41:32] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: my parents disregarded the law, and let me quite regular education at 12yo, and Isigend up at a programming school for adults, and studied prorgrammign instead
[14:41:53] <amigojapan> after I was 19, I went to the US and took GED and went to a normjal college
[14:42:17] <DaPinkOne> your major was japanese wasn't it?
[14:42:28] <amigojapan> no DaPinkOne 
[14:42:35] <DaPinkOne> :o
[14:42:44] <DaPinkOne> what's your poison?
[14:42:56] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: my school did nto even offer Japanese, I studied Japanese at a museum that offered it 
[14:43:07] <amigojapan> morikami museum in boca raton florida
[14:43:16] <DaPinkOne> a museum teaching? that sounds neat
[14:43:39] <Sapphirus> They'd send a truancy officer if you were a no-show for long enough, amigojapan
[14:43:54] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: yeah apparently they still etach it, btu I think my teacher must be very eklderly or passed away already
[14:44:17] <DaPinkOne> well, you're gettin up there in the years, it's bound to happen
[14:44:24] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: not in Mexico, Mexico has the law, but nobody cares
[14:44:41] <amigojapan> !c turancy
[14:44:41] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Truancy is any intentional, unjustified, unauthorised, or illegal absence from compulsory education. It is a deliberate absence by a student's own free will and usually does not refer to legitimate excused absences, such as ones related to medical conditions.
[14:44:59] <ketchupicecream> my teacher's didn't care 
[14:45:07] <ketchupicecream> i went to school to hang out
[14:45:12] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I think that kind of law woudl have hurt me and my family
[14:46:02] <ketchupicecream> and mostly skipped classes in high school. My class teacher knew that i studied at home, so padded my attendance lol
[14:46:07] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I ended up getting two degrees, one as a programmer analyst, and one in programming technology
[14:46:14] <Sapphirus> Truancy officer is just a nice name for a police constable that represents the school district.
[14:46:23] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: graduated with GPA 4.0 too
[14:46:35] <DaPinkOne> there's no reason for a truancy officer to be armed
[14:47:15] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: can they take the kids form the parents?
[14:47:17] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, associates, bachelor's or masters?
[14:47:58] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, it depends, I guess. 
[14:48:19] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: its weird cause I got a bachelors when I was 16 as a programmer analyst, and then I got an associates degree at 21 with programming technology major
[14:48:46] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I hope they make exeptions for cases like mine
[14:48:53] <ketchupicecream> your education system is so flexible
[14:49:05] <DaPinkOne> usually associates comes first. A bachelor's is a lot of work for a 16 year old kid
[14:49:36] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: yeah, I know, but I enjoyed it
[14:50:25] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, usually it results in a criminal offense and/or fine, not exceeding $1000, maximum jail time 30 days with 1-year probation.
[14:50:38] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: the school let me in at 12, they did not really accept people below 18, but my mom convinced them to give me a chance
[14:51:00] <amigojapan> that sucks Sapphirus
[14:51:22] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: they should have exceptions for people that are actually taking an alternative sutdy route
[14:52:19] <Sapphirus> There are exemptions, like homeschooling, illness, or they've already completed an equivalent education.
[14:52:48] <Sapphirus> Otherwise, you'll be subject to truancy laws, as a youth under our youth criminal justice legislation.
[14:52:53] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: thats still too strict and owuld nto have allowed me to take my route'
[14:53:08] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: you education system is msotly a cookie cutter
[14:53:16] <amigojapan> I dont fit the cookie cutter
[14:53:31] <Sapphirus> Yeah, that's where homeschooling usually comes into play.
[14:53:52] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: going ot a university at 12 is better than home schoooling
[14:54:06] <amigojapan> if you can do it
[14:55:02] <Sapphirus> That would likely only be permissible here if you could pass an entrance exam to ensure you are on par with someone with a diploma.
[14:55:18] <Sapphirus> Otherwise, a university wouldn't likely accept you.
[14:55:52] <Sapphirus> Homeschooling route and then to university at 18 is the closest route to what you describe.
[14:56:01] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: in my case, my mom asked them to give me a 1 month chance, and they did, and I ended up graduating, wanna see my diploma?
[14:56:09] <amigojapan> altho it is written in Spanish
[14:56:18] <amigojapan> it has me as a 16 yo kid
[14:56:25] <amigojapan> with a degree
[14:56:27] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, yeah, they wouldn't have allowed that here, I don't think.
[14:56:57] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: yeah, I see, and I think that woudll have been bad for me, anbd my family
[14:57:11] <Sapphirus> You may have had better 
[14:57:33] <Sapphirus> general education here, though, making those steps unnecessary
[14:57:46] <Sapphirus> I can't say for sure. 
[14:57:56] <amigojapan> ok, I guess, cant tell for sure
[14:58:11] <amigojapan> jinx
[14:59:01] <Sapphirus> Although me stating how our system works doesn't mean I necessarily agree with how it works.
[14:59:14] <Sapphirus> Just to make that clear. 😛
[14:59:31] <amigojapan> Sapphirus:, ah ok
[15:00:32] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I am glad thinsg worked out for me the way they did , even if it meant braking a few laws. I was very happy studying prorgamming at 12yo and beyond

[15:18:10] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: tho there are homeless kids in Mexico who never go to school at all, the Cannadian system would be better for them
[15:18:32] <amigojapan> they dont even learn how to read and write
[15:18:34] <DunceCotus> your children must be disciplined by prison, ahem, school
[15:18:46] <DunceCotus> to become obedient workers, resigned adults
[15:19:02] <amigojapan> hey DunceCotus
[15:19:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: hey
[15:19:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Mexico is a double sided sword, in which it really does not care how kids turn up, but on the other hand I coudl take my own path to education
[15:20:08] <DunceCotus> your children will be educated in the way the state defines education

[15:21:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: last time I went (11 years ago) there were still homeless kids in teh streets, performing different kinds of gigs whiel the traffic light changes just to get a few cents form drivers
[15:22:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: and plenty fo people in Mexico are illiterate
[15:22:44] <DunceCotus> I think that has more to do with poverty than freedom of education
[15:23:04] <amigojapan> yeah, I guess
[15:23:27] <DunceCotus> I guess the laxity of truancy laws worked out for you
[15:23:35] <DunceCotus> but you probably weren't poor
[15:23:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: my famly was fairly well off for Mexico, yes
[15:24:03] <DunceCotus> not to suggest that its better for poor families to have their children forced into the 'education system'
[15:24:48] <DunceCotus> schools were modelled after prisons back in the emergence of disciplinary society
[15:25:28] <DunceCotus> now they more resemble workplaces that micromanage employees/students, but still have lingering disciplinary aspects

[15:26:33] <DunceCotus> I feel like an open education system where kids can choose subjects they're interested in, choose to attend or not etc. would provide better education 'outcomes'
[15:26:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the prorgamming schools I went to after 12, were much better than the schools I went to before then, I felt happy there
[15:26:58] <DunceCotus> and smaller classrooms, more interaction with tutors
[15:27:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the lack of small kids may have helped
[15:27:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: nice
[15:27:57] <amigojapan> ty
[15:28:45] <DunceCotus> I think most schooling at least in the West is really just training and disciplining them to be suitable employees for the workplace
[15:28:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it was also ovious I was studying something practical, whcih I did not feel in general education
[15:29:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:Mexico is also a country of the west
[15:29:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: workplaces get us to do things we don't want to do, things have have no practical application to ourselves individually
[15:30:02] <DunceCotus> so schools reflect and reinforce this
[15:30:30] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but tech schools seem to be completly practical
[15:30:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think it might be different depending on where in Mexico

[16:52:54] <amigojapan> I see
[16:52:56] <senti> so yeah, that was fun
[16:53:03] <amigojapan> senti: do you work with linux servers?
[16:53:13] <senti> anyway, I sorted that out, and they're using an external file host for large files

[16:53:27] <amigojapan> I see
[16:53:31] <senti> I rarely have to deal with windows servers.
[16:53:38] <senti> I hate windows servers.
[16:53:44] <senti> linux is my thing
[16:53:44] <amigojapan> ah ok
[16:54:31] <amigojapan> senti: back in the 90s, my Unix teacher used to say "this operating system is old enough to drink and drive"
[16:54:40] <amigojapan> when comparing unix to windows
[16:54:46] <senti> usually though, the linux servers I deal with are either CentOS or Ubuntu
[16:55:00] <amigojapan> alright

[17:02:03] <senti> fair enough, but don't play around with the actual racial term in question given the context, please.
[17:02:25] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: country name is not the n-word treeman5 used, though
[17:02:43] <amigojapan> agreed Urchin[emacs], I already warned him
[17:02:43] <hassoon> 'sup
[17:03:13] <senti> that is indeed a country, but you would not have mentioned it if someone had not used the racial term, would you?
[17:03:24] <analoq> banning words? germany is one step ahead of you guys! we are already banning letters! :D
[17:04:04] <senti> the point is to not facilitate racism at all in the channel. It's a hard stop policy.

[17:11:22] <bxgelsan> senti: you liked ride the lightning?
[17:11:28] <bxgelsan> i had the cassette.

[17:11:45] <senti> yessss
[17:12:04] <senti> ah, I never used napster
[17:12:04] <bxgelsan> still decent music, not my most favorite
[17:12:10] <senti> I remember those old days
[17:12:20] <bxgelsan> senti: it was really basic. xdcc/usenet was superior.
[17:12:26] <senti> I used this program called WinMX
[17:12:26] <amigojapan> senti: I used napster
[17:12:28] <bxgelsan> and still is tbh
[17:12:30] <senti> to get music
[17:12:41] <analoq> senti: i remember that one!
[17:12:50] <senti> I briefly tried kazaa
[17:13:03] <analoq> you had to give yourself a username, and damn did i pick the cringiest names i could come up with :D
[17:13:04] <senti> before it was pretty much malware
[17:13:13] <amigojapan> senti: got some of my first Japanese songs thru napster
[17:13:13] <bxgelsan> i dont know the internels of the release scene but im thankful for all the work they did
[17:13:22] <bxgelsan> watched some good films and anime i never would have
[17:13:34] <bxgelsan> also early days of fansubs were interesting
[17:13:38] <analoq> amigojapan: arent there some japanese p2p programs that use heavy encryption?
[17:13:38] <bxgelsan> lots of hard work :)
[17:13:46] <analoq> i remember trying one years back
[17:14:02] <hassoon> trying hat
[17:14:04] <hassoon> * what
[17:14:05] <amigojapan> analoq: no idea, but in Japan it is particularly illegal
[17:14:10] <senti> bxgelsan, I remember downloading that Kingdom Hearts song over an old p2p client back in the day (I don't think that was WinMX, it was something else)
[17:14:14] <senti> I can't remember
[17:14:19] <amigojapan> analoq: I would nto use it
[17:14:27] <analoq> perfect dark i think was the name

[17:18:27] <amigojapan> yup
[17:18:37] <bxgelsan> thats why you dont use your own connection. time to get a legit anetnna on the low and scan/break into wifi networks.
[17:18:48] <bxgelsan> one friend had insane range on his setup
[17:18:50] <bxgelsan> o.o

[17:19:43] <analoq> amigojapan: yeah streams are grey in seemingly many countries, but some sites apparently operate a p2p system, so you may unknowingly upload

[17:23:02] <bxgelsan> senti: my music taste is so varied. learned lots of different music.
[17:23:02] <analoq> amigojapan: same here. there was a tech talk on CCC about a guy who runs a tor exit node. They raided him multiple times, knowing that it's completely pointless and not illegal
[17:23:03] <senti> oh man, this is some 90's and early 2000's nostalgia for me
[17:23:44] <amigojapan> ouch analoq
[17:24:05] <analoq> the trick is to do the questionable stuff on a server outside your country. police wont care because it's too much work
[17:24:06] <bxgelsan> analoq: tldr dont run tor exit nodes on your home connection
[17:24:21] <bxgelsan> and if you run one, make sure the rack provider knows wtf is up.
[17:24:23] <bxgelsan> and is ok with it.
[17:24:29] <senti> I personally don't really bother with tor. I hate the latency I get.
[17:24:33] <amigojapan> analoq: sure, I think the only non risky way to do it is ot use a seedbox outside of Japan
[17:24:48] <senti> A vpn is sufficient for my piracy.
[17:24:56] <bxgelsan> senti: learn to use tor. i dont have connection issues.
[17:24:59] <bxgelsan> well
[17:25:02] <analoq> bxgelsan: yeah that was the gist of it. however the guy was doing it to proof a point, he was backed by some foundation so it was a somewhat leveled playing field
[17:25:05] <bxgelsan> as of late internet been getting hi
[17:25:07] <bxgelsan> hit
[17:25:12] <bxgelsan> russia etc blah blah standard bs

[17:25:45] <amigojapan> hdie*

[17:25:54] <senti> I'm a hit and run guy on torrents. A dishonorable man, I admit.
[17:25:55] <bxgelsan> :)
[17:26:06] <amigojapan> ah ok senti
[17:26:25] <analoq> bxgelsan: ofc not. i dont think the police is even malicious about them. It's just they simply get caught by the net they throw out
[17:26:29] <bxgelsan> i forget the rough explaination but its got a defender a protector and a exit node, takes like 3 steps before taking 3 steps
[17:26:32] <bxgelsan> i could be wrong
[17:26:51] <amigojapan> analoq: I have heard that the definition of stream  is that it is ok menawhile you only keep stuff in the browser cache, but not if yout ake them out'
[17:26:58] <senti> also, I live in the US, so torrenting isn't like, gonna be a big deal anyway to get noticed anyway.

[17:29:03] <analoq> amigojapan: but do you know of actual cases were people were raided due to too much "upload"?
[17:29:07] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: and he almost did it withought novacaine, I had to remind him
[17:29:08] <bxgelsan> senti: sure. 
[17:29:26] <analoq> i mean there are plenty of reasons for high upload these days. any influencer will upload shitloads of data
[17:29:28] <bxgelsan> they wanted to know what happened in the past 7mo a year ago

[17:29:45] <amigojapan> no analoq, but iodnt usually wtach news much, I have seen ads in movie theaters saying ti is illegal

[17:30:42] <bxgelsan> but i pop up in things
[17:30:51] <amigojapan> analoq: "downloading is punishable with 2 years inprison plus fines, uploading is punishabel with 10 years in prison, plus fines"
[17:31:03] <amigojapan> analoq: they have it before every movie
[17:31:06] <senti> I bet "glow in the darks" have my labeled as a drunk.
[17:31:13] <bxgelsan> ketchupicecream: i confessed to ww2 and got the joys of sleep depervation and mostly psychological torture techniques. 
[17:31:20] <analoq> amigojapan: i spoke specifically about "uploading amounts" not actually illegal data
[17:31:37] <analoq> you said earlier that you may get raided simply based on your "upload amounts"
[17:31:58] <senti> what if... I was never drunk ever! Fooled the whole lot of ya yeah?
[17:32:03] <senti> nah, I'm drunk.
[17:32:09] <hassoon> again ?
[17:32:12] <bxgelsan> senti: we have people in this channel like that
[17:32:13] <bxgelsan> :p
[17:32:15] <senti> would be a cool plot twist though
[17:32:17] <amigojapan> analoq: I have seen people in the news get raided. also hwen the law got into place, they called me asking me why I uploaded 30GB...
[17:32:31] * senti spears hassoon

[18:06:07] <sentionics> bxgelsan, indeed. I'm a bit too open with my alcoholism, I guess that's pretty much my life I guess. Maybe that's my problem. Life is too boring so I compensate with alcohol.

[18:07:34] <sentionics> now it's gotten worse.
[18:07:48] <sentionics> and often, I don't eat at all while drinking. That's why I stock up on milk a lot.
[18:07:51] <bxgelsan> sentionics: buy some puerh tea. quit drinking. or you know. drink yourself to death. your choice.
[18:07:54] <sentionics> it's fast nutrition
[18:07:59] <bxgelsan> you dont eat while drinking so you can get more fucked up.
[18:08:02] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: one of the things that worries me the most about self driving cars is that the moral decissions a self driving car does are (or were) being voted for online by random internet stangers, with images of pregnant women and chidlren and homeless people, this is on a site designed by MIT to decide what those cars should do in a moral dilemma...
[18:08:03] <analoq> Sometimes i wonder if IRC is the melting pot for failed (r/antiwork) reddit mods~
[18:08:07] <bxgelsan> eating interferes with the absorbtion

[18:08:22] <bxgelsan> not an insult but you really are the definition of an alcohol, but dont let it completely define you.

[18:16:00] <bxgelsan> i cant drive legally anymore, i black out.
[18:16:04] <bxgelsan> im a danger to the road.
[18:16:05] <Poeticode> I've seen their test scores and decisions to drive after parties
[18:16:09] <bxgelsan> or people on it.
[18:16:09] <DunceCotus> they desire their own repression
[18:16:11] <bxgelsan> :\
[18:16:38] <sentionics> ouch man
[18:16:41] <sentionics> that's rough
[18:16:46] <bxgelsan> not really
[18:16:49] <bxgelsan> just frustrating
[18:16:50] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: black out?
[18:16:58] <analoq> bxgelsan: neighbor had the same problem, and managed to black out and hit a motorbike on the road :/
[18:17:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: cars could kill half the population on earth, and people owudl still want cars
[18:17:00] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: where does race come into this?
[18:17:02] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus: uh, i go into a state where im not really in the car
[18:17:07] <bxgelsan> and dont have full control
[18:17:13] <sentionics> I personally have a gas station in walking distance from my apartment. I don't even have to drive to get alcohol. I guess that's what makes things worse.
[18:17:25] <sentionics> or maybe better, at least I don't have to drive drunk if I get too crazy
[18:17:26] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: oh :/
[18:17:55] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus: I dont think its PTSD related. I never really tried to figure out why. I mean I was in a car accident once that caused me to hallucinate.
[18:17:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the molar aggregate mob
[18:17:59] <sentionics> cops here never have bothered me while I've ambled drunkenly to and from my apartment for more alcohol
[18:18:02] <bxgelsan> So that could hold some bearing.
[18:18:08] <Poeticode> better public transit would help a lot, but at least in the USA we're fucked thanks to white suburbanites dismantling the whole system so that scary people can't easily get to their neighborhoods
[18:18:28] <sentionics> I guess I should be happy cars haven't run me over crossing the street or something
[18:19:05] <sentionics> jokes aside, I'm quite aware, even when drunk as hell. so that's not really a problem for me.
[18:19:09] <bxgelsan> sentionics: do you still drunk drive? be honest.
[18:19:20] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: cars dont kill people.. people kill people.. unless its a tesla
[18:19:27] <bxgelsan> and dont downplay it with i only go a few miles.
[18:19:36] <sentionics> that's tantamount to admitting to a crime, mate.
[18:19:44] <sentionics> if I did, I wouldn't be able to say it.
[18:19:56] <bxgelsan> sentionics: you already admitted to it once
[18:20:01] <sentionics> so you can't trust me saying no, but if I said yes, well...
[18:20:03] <bxgelsan> at this point it doesnt matter.
[18:20:10] <bxgelsan> sentionics: you answered my question
[18:20:14] <bxgelsan> by not
[18:20:17] <bxgelsan> thanks.
[18:20:24] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: in a tesla programmers kill people
[18:20:37] <DunceCotus> the car is part of a road network
[18:20:37] <bxgelsan> sentionics: fucking quit it. i'll leave it at that.
[18:20:49] <sentionics> sorry mate, I don't mean to dodge your questions like that, but I'm a bit skiddish on some things
[18:20:57] <DunceCotus> you cannot really separate the car from the road network and its inherent casualty probability
[18:21:05] <analoq> amigojapan: they still require you to drive the car. if you decide to sleep...well
[18:21:09] <sentionics> you are right, I will avoid it. I'll say that.
[18:21:19] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: you may want a better road network but that would also necessitate a new kind of vehicle
[18:21:20] <analoq> i agree the system is a joke if you cant rely on it
[18:21:23] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: naa just a bad algorithm that sees people as trash cans
[18:21:29] <bxgelsan> sentionics: if I find out you kill someone while drunk driving ill call where your at, get up with an inmate and tell them you are a chomo.
[18:21:43] <Poeticode> there's also the problem that the machine learning used for machine vision etc are kind of black boxes; neither the user nor the coder actually knows how it works
[18:21:43] <ButterNoodle> -code kills man
[18:21:44] <bxgelsan> and im not gonna talk anymore about it.
[18:21:50] <bxgelsan> :)
[18:21:52] <amigojapan> Ah right analoq 
[18:21:55] <sentionics> bxgelsan, whoa, ok, ok. point taken.
[18:22:08] <sentionics> yes sir, understood.
[18:22:18] <bxgelsan> analoq: in, out.
[18:22:52] <sentionics> though, if I did such a thing, I'd deserve the death penalty, so that's a given.
[18:22:57] <DunceCotus> cars as we know them only make sense in the context of a road network of congestion, innumerable risks, potential for deaths etc.
[18:23:17] <DunceCotus> so it is absolutely the case that cars kill people
[18:23:28] <DunceCotus> they are part of the road-vehicle system
[18:23:32] <bxgelsan> sentionics: telling an inmate that another inmate is a chomo and if its half way believable, don't worry. they'll probably [r] and [k] you after.
[18:23:36] <DunceCotus> arrangement
[18:24:06] <bxgelsan> or just [r] you for your whole stay.
[18:24:18] <sentionics> bxgelsan, it would be deserved in such a case. I refuse to let such a thing happen. I refuse to hurt someone like that.
[18:24:20] <analoq> amigojapan: there was a lawsuit/verdict in germany (last week) in which tesla had to refund a model 3 because the autopilot apparently "steered like a drunk driver", which the owner wouldnt accept :P
[18:24:21] <bxgelsan> sentionics: consequences for poor choices. make better.
[18:24:32] <DunceCotus> if self-driving cars take over, this will change the road network
[18:24:36] <DunceCotus> it will also change cars
[18:24:38] <sentionics> bxgelsan, you are right
[18:24:41] <bxgelsan> sentionics: gl, you are always half a second from death.
[18:24:49] <sentionics> indeed

[18:27:14] <bxgelsan> because alcohol stops the thinking, for whatever reason you do it for.
[18:27:33] <sentionics> it started as pleasure
[18:27:44] <sentionics> but now, I need it to just feel alive at all.

[18:30:03] <bxgelsan> I feign ignorance sometimes for the sake of conversation.

[18:30:19] <sentionics> I'm not comfortable when I come down, but it feels good when I'm up
[18:30:35] <sentionics> I don't want to stop feeling up
[18:30:48] <bxgelsan> i dont know why im telling you this shit, no one from here ive seen actually follow advice

[18:31:04] <DunceCotus> nobody follows advice directly 
[18:31:09] <sentionics> letting go means, I have to let go of this pleasure. I have to let go of how good drinking makes me feel.
[18:31:10] <bxgelsan> fender gave me lots of good advice years ago, listened to it. not drinking, only smoke weed.
[18:31:13] <DunceCotus> our words are not wasted bxgelsan

[18:31:31] <analoq> ive known a few alcoholics irl. helping them is pointless unless maybe through force. its way easier to simply replace them.

[18:31:44] <bxgelsan> like, lately i just been laying in bed snuggling blankets
[18:31:45] <Zoidberg> sentionics: I am worried if you ever stop drinking, you might die from cumulative hangover.

[18:32:39] <Zoidberg> you can't tell when someone is serious
[18:32:53] <bxgelsan> Zoidberg: i think you can tell when im serious.

[18:33:08] <bxgelsan> my typing style changes, im rational. and i type faster.

[18:36:27] <analoq> he's still alive 15years later and i think sober
[18:36:49] <sentionics> how long has he been sober?
[18:36:57] <Poeticode> it's different for everyone ofc, but my alcy friend was able to quit by going to one of those 4 month rehab centers. Had to learn how to do other things in life for fun basically, playing basketball with people n stuff
[18:36:58] <analoq> on the other side he has nothing and walks like a zombie xD
[18:37:41] <analoq> sentionics: for years i believe. i see him walking around occasionally. but his whole career got fucked. dont know if he ever finished school
[18:37:56] <Poeticode> but he's now at the point where if he were to binge drink two nights in a row he'd get delirium tremens and have to go to the ER
[18:38:18] <sentionics> gods, that's rough
[18:38:41] <sentionics> DTs are the ass end of alcohol withdrawal. Shit kills untreated (1/5 of the time)
[18:39:17] <Poeticode> yeah the fear of DT is probably why I haven't gotten to the point of drinking every day D:

[21:52:56] <ezekielnoob> is that the dog fighter
[21:53:07] <JesseDesu> its the everything fighter
[21:53:29] <JesseDesu> it does everything
[21:53:44] <JesseDesu> depending what weapons and sensors you put on it
[21:54:00] <ezekielnoob> i see... and the newer model is the F22?
[21:54:06] <ezekielnoob> which i hear is too... expensive
[21:54:38] <JesseDesu> its basically a deterrence fighter
[21:54:47] <JesseDesu> has no record of air to air combat
[21:54:56] <JesseDesu> because if it did, we'd be in a world war
[21:55:45] <ezekielnoob> do these jets even have a match
[21:56:06] <ezekielnoob> or are there wweapons that can easily take them down
[21:56:17] <JesseDesu> supposedly the J-20 and Su-57

[21:56:59] <JesseDesu> again no proof

[22:19:19] <Bco1981> well the camera focus on the boobs being in the way... but she probably isn't as slim as they would have you think.
[22:19:36] <Bco1981> so the belly is probably also in the way.
