[02:58:59] <lpv[m]> yo guys how do you get to change alt+num for tab switching to something like win+num on qute? cause alt reserved for i3 :p
[03:00:06] <demure> lpv[m]: I use super (win) key for my i3, as most programs use alt -- as well as my terminal bindings needing alt.
[03:00:25] <demure> a non answer, but I think you'll be better off fixing your i3 binding.
[03:03:22] <lpv[m]> hm.. maybe you're right. Haven't needed in a week that I'm setting up this system but it makes sense. It's just im afraid my hands will be even more sore from small keyboard/awkward binds :p
[03:04:57] <lpv[m]>  so yeah I'm probably sticking to that till I'm really needing that alt or I get a bigger laptop heh but thanks for the suggestion
[03:06:00] <emanuele6> `:unbind <Alt+0>' `:unbind <Alt+1>'... `:bind <Meta+0> tab-focus 10' `:bind <Meta+1> tab-focus 1'...
[03:06:45] <lpv[m]> oh. gotta do it like that eh? ^_^ haha alrighty
[03:06:57] <emanuele6> or something like: for n in range(10): config.unbind(f'<Alt+{n}>',mode='normal') config.bind(f'<Meta+{n}',f'tab-focus -n {n or 10}',mode='normal') in python
[03:07:47] <emanuele6> s/n}'/n}>'/
[03:08:56] <toofar> The-Compiler: I don't use the dark mode usually so haven't tried it with qt6
[03:11:27] <lpv[m]> emanuele6: you can use that py script in qute?
[03:13:04] <emanuele6> if you don't have a config.py file for qutebrowser, you can put that code in a random file and `:config-source /path/to/that/file'.
[03:15:28] <lpv[m]> ah awesome! that was one more thing I had to fix, was getting that error on startup
[03:19:59] <emanuele6> you could also run commands from the command line.
[03:21:09] <emanuele6> bash$ for i in {1..10}; do qutebrowser ":unbind <Alt+$i> ;; bind <Meta+$i> tab-focus $i"; done
[03:21:29] <emanuele6> and then do alt+0 meta+0 manually
[03:22:10] <emanuele6> s/10/9/
[03:23:33] <emanuele6> bash$ for i in {0..9}; do qutebrowser ":unbind <Alt+$i> ;; bind <Meta+$i> tab-focus ${i/%0/10}"; done
[03:23:41] <emanuele6> that would also work to do all in one go
[03:32:49] <lpv[m]> #!/bash/sh instead of bash$ will do the same thing?
[03:33:37] <lpv[m]> I mean I tried your command but was getting syntax error so tried that and seemed to do something, open like 10 qutes xD but keys the same :p

[03:34:14] <emanuele6> ...
[03:34:16] <emanuele6> no
[03:34:44] <emanuele6> #!/bin/bash maybe, not #!/bin/sh.
[03:34:59] <lpv[m]> oh
[03:35:06] <emanuele6> but bash$ was just meant to tell you that that was bash code
[03:35:26] <emanuele6> and the suggesting was to just paste that code in a terminal running bash and press enter.
[03:36:03] <emanuele6> (code does not include "bash$".)
[03:38:18] <lpv[m]> lmao yeah right, my bad sorry. either way it just keeps openning 10 tabs but no change in binds
[03:38:40] <emanuele6> what version of qutebrowser are you running?
[03:39:17] <lpv[m]> 2.4.0-2
[03:39:24] <lpv[m]> that's from arch repo
[03:39:49] <emanuele6> are you running that bash code while qutebrowser is open?
[03:40:36] <lpv[m]>  well anyhow it's alright. I'll figure it out. cheers for the help ;)
[03:40:58] <emanuele6> qutebrowser must be running for that to work.
[03:41:24] <emanuele6> anyhow, i tried to copy paste that snippet of code and it worked.
[03:42:42] <lpv[m]> O.o
[03:42:44] <lpv[m]> that's weird
[03:44:45] <lpv[m]> did it also open 10 instances of qute? :p
[03:45:09] <emanuele6> no, that is not how it works.
[03:48:01] <lpv[m]> oh that's probably cause I've replaced the qutebrowser binary with a script that executes the binary through my nvidia card (couldn't get it to work on the igpu)
[03:49:40] <lpv[m]> yah it works! woo! hah
[04:13:18] <lpv[m]>  well I'm dumb. default next/prev tab bindings are more than enough

[13:49:07] <wasamasa> you beat me at procrastination
[13:49:51] <wasamasa> anyway, I wanted to ask whether there's a way to inspect or extract files from the browser cache
[13:50:54] <wasamasa> looked at ~/.cache/qutebrowser and ~/.local/share/qutebrowser but couldn't find anything obvious
[13:51:04] <The-Compiler> oof :D
[13:51:17] <The-Compiler> I wish that script had a way to view the postpone history
[13:51:22] <isene> The-Compiler: "Name" = Title of the tab (the string that appears in the tab row)
[13:51:43] <The-Compiler> also I should probably reboot my server more often
[13:52:05] <wasamasa> I remember chromium just storing the plain files in a cache directory
[13:52:31] <wasamasa> but this is webengine, so hm
[13:53:02] <The-Compiler> the storage is coming entirely from Chromium as far as I'm aware

[16:58:18] <wasamasa> is there some roadmap when they upgrade their chromium to which version?
[17:14:46] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: well, usually a new QtWebEngine minor release will upgrade it to whatever was available during the feature freeze
[17:15:20] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: though the rendering architecture seems a bit different, given that QtWebEngine renders stuff via a Qt Widget
[17:16:36] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: finally, qutebrowser keeps compatibility for older Qt versions for quite some time usually, right now you can still run it with Qt 5.12 from some 3 years ago
[17:18:19] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: judging by https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtwebengine.git/commit/?id=3ee51f8f085da394851857b0d6a42df537ca99da it might already be using ozone for quite some time though?
