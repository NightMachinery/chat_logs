[06:25:52] <kline> shapr, send it to HN instead
[06:26:39] <banna> HN would like that article it seems
[06:26:45] <banna> only read the first paragraph though
[06:30:01] <banna> I feel like posing an article-question / outright question probing the culture around documenting work + how much time do people get to spend on documenting their work
[06:30:20] <shapr> zero at my jobs
[06:30:47] <shapr> and that continues to cost my current employer huge amounts of wasted effort
[06:31:03] <banna> yeah. it seems just to be a... 'not needed' thing, yet the most essential component to software.
[06:31:31] <banna> I'm currently switching out jobs and am thankful that I'm getting some time to put together some docs.
[06:31:40] <shapr> today's example is that we serialized datatypes to the database, but there's no documentation on whether a particular type already has serialization logic somewhere, and if you can find the serialization logic, that still doesn't tell you which table it's in
[06:31:53] <shapr> or whether you can just hook into the existing code, or if there's some hidden invariant
[06:32:09] <shapr> nobody knows unless they wrote it themselves
[06:32:31] <banna> mmm. that sounds like a wonderful can of worms.
[06:32:53] <shapr> management wants features shipped asap
[06:32:57] <shapr> docs be damned
[06:33:50] <banna> as per usual. realistically, good docs are some of the hardest things to produce
[06:34:48] <gwozniak> We try reasonably hard at work to document things pretty well
[06:36:33] <gwozniak> Doesn't always work out, but we generally make the effort
[06:36:36] <banna> I'm sure it helps more than it hurts.

[06:39:18] <banna> (minimal, if no docs)
[06:40:29] <banna> It's always a balance of having the codebase structure being somewhat readable/traceable, and having enough words to go along with that to guide new developers on working with the codebase as a whole.

[08:08:26] <kline> depends on the threat model i suppose
[08:09:13] <kline> i dont think zfs is supposed to be equivalent to stuff like truecrypt where you can have plausible deniable volumes that look like noise
[08:10:05] <kline> if zfs only encrypts the data and not administrative metadata then factor that into your threat model and adapt as needed, but it still has value, its just not going to be the right tool for every use case

[14:21:01] <jj5> man, my old MBP Just Isn't Working :( I can't get the external display to work over HDMI, it's detected, but it won't work :(
[14:23:57] <gerikson> jj5: sucks!
[14:24:00] <gerikson> how old is it?
[14:24:04] <jj5> yeah so annoying
[14:24:12] <jj5> it's pretty old. gimme a tick...
[14:24:29] <gerikson> mine is 2014 or something
[14:24:35] <jj5> 17-inch, Late 2011
[14:24:41] <gerikson> yeah...
[14:24:49] <iDrougge> Define "not work".
[14:25:17] <jj5> iDrougge: no output on the display, i.e. no signal detected
[14:25:40] <jj5> but the display works when I attach other devices (it's actually connected to a KVM)
[14:25:54] <iDrougge> But the machine acts as if there is an external display connected and lets you arrange screens and so forth?
[14:26:05] <jj5> and it's weird because the MBP detects the monitor and provides resolution settings etc for it
[14:26:27] <jj5> iDrougge: yes, exactly. I can arrange the screens in the config, but no signal on the monitor itself
[14:26:49] <iDrougge> Have you zapped the PRAM and all that?
[14:27:08] <jj5> iDrougge: negative. I don't even know what that means...
[14:28:03] <jj5> I'm afraid to do much to this machine, it's well passed its supported life.
[14:28:06] <iDrougge> It clears the parameter RAM. There may be one or two such things to try out depending on the Mac generation.
[14:28:11] <gerikson> imagine 20 years ago someone saying you could use a computer 10+ years...
[14:29:41] <jj5> I just use this for web browsing and electronics stuff on my workbench. my new MBP is a 16-inch 2019 model
[14:30:22] <jj5> I ordered a new workstation today too. It's funny because I got pretty much the same thing I got back in 2017. i.e. Intel CPU, ASUS ROG Strix mobo, etc.
