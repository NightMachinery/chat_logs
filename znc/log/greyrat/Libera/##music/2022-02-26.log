[07:43:11] <artao> no morlog not any joking
[07:43:22] <louipx> iduno go ask some shady doctor to give you something to induce a seizure then
[07:43:22] <morlog> could be though 
[07:43:35] <artao> to watch that video ...... BAD if youy're sensitive to flashy shit
[07:43:38] <artao> BAD
[07:43:51] <artao> it's a fair warning is all
[07:43:57] <morlog> watch that one pokemon video

[07:44:19] <R2robot> piercedwater: i thought you were into some sort of drugs... no?  lol
[07:44:22] <artao> watch MY video then, if you can handle it

[07:44:35] <artao> boob bot
[07:44:47] <artao> anyhow
[07:45:00] <artao> i  submitted it to FACT magazine
[07:45:07] <louipx> tho i guess its better to find out youre prone to seizures while sitting at home on the couch watching tv
[07:45:15] <louipx> than instead going out and about in public
[07:45:18] <artao> y'all would largely not care for the music the publish
[07:45:26] <louipx> or at a dance club with strobe lights or something
[07:45:27] <artao> but mine? fits
[07:45:30] <artao> i hope
[07:46:37] <artao> i'll find out soon enuf i guess. it was tricky to find where to submit music
[07:47:02] <piercedwater> you could make your own device
[07:47:07] <piercedwater> and distribute on that
[07:47:11] <artao> yeah, sure
[07:47:30] <artao> to get on Clone  tho>?
[07:47:34] <artao> way better
[07:47:35] <louipx> yea sell all your music on a circuitboard with ROM
[07:47:39] <piercedwater> lol
[07:47:53] <artao> i think my music fits Clone Records
[07:48:07] <louipx> and an analog output
[07:48:17] <artao> um
[07:48:21] <louipx> that way makes it hard to make an exact digital copy
[07:48:24] <artao> i have speakers
[07:48:37] <piercedwater> headphones \o/
[07:48:40] <louipx> all copies will be imperfect audio resamplings
[07:48:48] <artao> analog output is ....... well ........ ANYTHING your ears hear
[07:48:55] <louipx> unless someone copies directly fromt he ROM
[07:49:03] <artao> this SHOULD sound good on headphones too
[07:49:08] <louipx> which i guess some hacker will do eventually
[07:49:23] <artao> i mixed it both in and out of

[07:58:21] <louipx> what do you recommend Gerula 
[07:59:02] <louipx> i wouldnt mind a small wire. like if the reciever was a seperate thing and you could plug any headphone into it
[07:59:18] <louipx> then the transmitter was plugged into the audio source
[07:59:31] <Gerula> if you are ok with 320k mp3, then $100 bluetooth from most brands will be fine
[07:59:53] <Gerula> if you listen to lossless, probably gonna need at least $200 for high bitrate codec support
[07:59:58] <louipx> i like the idea of just plugging any headphone into a wireless receiver
[08:00:22] <Gerula> a dongle you clamp to your body is also ok
[08:00:25] <louipx> Gerula: yea thats not bad then

[19:07:39] <Inline> rule c is concurrent with rule a
[19:07:50] <Inline> but the context is not that of rule c
[19:08:03] <Inline> so rule a holds
[19:09:10] <Inline> when war ships are allowed to go back to their bases, that might be so, but not in war, rule c is for after war is over....
[19:09:36] <R2robot> piercedwater: sounds spicy.  I sorta kinda remember a twitch streamer mentioning it a while back. heh
[19:09:52] <Inline> they still can go back to their bases, but not in war
[19:09:58] <piercedwater> yeah, i like it because it gives me a boost after i eat. or, if i want, it can calm me down

[23:40:54] <morf> Lviv-based Pravda brewery switches to making Molotov cocktails.
[23:40:55] <morf> lol
[23:42:23] <MusicalDillo> heh
[23:42:34] <morlog> looking like im going to have to delay the start of this bike trip a few more weeks
[23:42:52] <MusicalDillo> Well, the weather will be warmer
[23:43:04] <morlog> yeah
[23:44:47] <morlog> will get my tent sometime today
[23:45:09] <morlog> going to move around into it as i get ready
[23:45:38] <morlog> will make it easier to slim down and get my bike packed up just right
[23:45:54] <MusicalDillo> Good idea, so you have everything set the way you want before you leave
[23:46:32] <morlog> bunch of different ways to set the tent up so ill get a chance to try them out
[23:48:15] *** Quits: efex_ (~efex@S0106a84e3fbc9313.du.shawcable.net) (Quit: efex_)
[23:49:08] <morlog> yeah
[23:50:40] <R2robot> are you vlogging your trip?
[23:50:45] <morlog> id have to give up too much stuff without a trailer
[23:51:06] <morlog> i have a blog going
[23:51:15] <R2robot> that's sooooo 2000s
[23:51:24] <morlog> ill do a vlog if i can get a camcorder
[23:51:25] <R2robot> the world demands vlogs! :D
[23:51:44] <R2robot> also, camp vlogging is pretty big on youtube.. you could make some passive income
[23:51:49] <morlog> doing it from a phone would he crap
[23:52:02] <morlog> yeah, thats the plan
[23:52:05] <R2robot> depends on the phone
[23:52:12] <R2robot> but everyone has to start somewhere :)
[23:52:19] <morlog> want to link it up with my wordpress blog
[23:52:29] *** Joins: jbwncster (uid72776@id-72776.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[23:52:47] <morlog> allmost every entry on my blog was done from a smartphone
[23:53:18] <R2robot> too bad I lost a lot of stuff when I moved.. I could have sent you one of my old gopros
[23:53:28] <morlog> dang
[23:54:05] <morf> cornpros
[23:54:37] <morlog> if i wait till my next check i could probably find something that would work well at a pawn shop
[23:54:51] <R2robot> yeah.
[23:55:05] <R2robot> there's a bunch of cheap gopro knockoffs now too
[23:55:10] <morlog> otherwise its if i get lucky at a thrift store or yard sale
[23:56:04] <morlog> i could build one with my raspi with the right case
[23:57:03] <R2robot> not sure how rugged that would be.
[23:57:08] <morlog> would end up costing the same as a gopro by the end of it though
[23:57:12] <R2robot> yeah
[23:57:42] <R2robot> this was my vlog mount from the motorbike https://i.imgur.com/Sytll8z.jpg
[23:58:05] <R2robot> ran a mic into the lining of my helmet
[23:58:15] <morlog> nice

[23:59:09] <morlog> i want to put one on the handlebars
[23:59:51] <morlog> ive seen some 360° action cams that would be cool to mount on a pole on the seat
