[15:39:20] <PeGaSuS> I wonder if there's still some stickers packs left...
[16:08:06] <Mitaka> zoite, topkek.  I wish it was, but then I wouldn't bring a camera.  I'd bring â‚¬ 1000 of eggs the smash against the windows.
[16:08:34] <bookworm> hey, the nice house can't be blamed for their shitty owner
[16:08:57] <Mitaka> That's true.  But it's the owner who has to clean up.  Or pay for the cleanup
[16:09:08] <bookworm> where is that if I may ask?
[16:09:25] <bookworm> looks nice
[16:09:36] <Mitaka> It's De Haar Castle in The Netherlands.
[16:10:40] <bookworm> well, historic records say scratch the egg plan, burn it to the ground instead :P
[16:11:10] <bookworm> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Haar_Castle#/media/File:De_Haar_Castle_Drone.jpg neat
[16:11:33] <bookworm> that's... not the right preview
[16:11:36] <bookworm> TL, godamned

[16:11:59] <bookworm> ...
[16:12:02] * bookworm gives up
[16:12:14] <Mitaka> I went there to scout nice locations for when they can have events again.
[16:12:31] <Mitaka> Picture is taken from about where that white truck is parked.
[16:12:35] <bookworm> medieval style ?
[16:12:50] <Mitaka> Yes.
[16:13:00] <bookworm> uuuu, I wanna come
[16:13:14] <Mitaka> They annually host Elfia.  But they skipped twice due to the covid-19 pandemic.
[16:13:24] <bookworm> naturally... 
[16:13:49] <Mitaka> https://www.elfia.com/en/haarzuilens/
[16:13:50] <bookworm> I'm definitely in :D
[16:13:57] <shadoozo> A Dutchie Hmmm?
[16:14:01] <bookworm> minus the language barrier, but hey
[16:14:07] <bookworm> nah, Swiss
[16:14:17] <bookworm> but close enough that a trip is worth it
[16:14:47] <shadoozo> I meant Mitaka
[16:15:04] <Mitaka> If you are making a trip that far I recommend going to their other event instead.  That's in Arcen.  The garden is quite a bit bigger and the attendence is much better.
[16:15:29] <Mitaka> And that's this september.
[16:17:05] <bookworm> name?
[16:17:32] <bookworm> ah, elfia Arcen?
[16:17:41] <Mitaka> Yes.
[16:23:52] <bookworm> thanks for the tip :)
