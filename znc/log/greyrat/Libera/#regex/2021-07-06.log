[17:02:17] <re101-birman-82> getting a catastrophic backtracking on this regex, can you help me ?
[17:02:19] <digitok> you typed the other one manually
[17:02:49] <digitok> catastrophic backtracking is my specialty
[17:03:54] <digitok> there's only one match in that whole data?
[17:04:14] <re101-birman-82> I would like to extract 4 components of the message which can/can't be available (method, status code, path and error message) 
[17:04:32] <digitok> yea, i adjusted this regex yesterday
[17:05:13] <re101-birman-82> Yes, in this case I got the catastrophic backtracking
[17:06:59] <digitok> where are you using the regex?
[17:07:12] <digitok> other than regex101
[17:07:21] <re101-birman-82> Zabbix, to monitor my app log
[17:09:02] <digitok> cool, it uses pcre
[17:10:49] <digitok> gimme a sec and i'll look at it
[17:10:56] <re101-birman-82> sure
[17:16:31] <digitok> i assume you're escaping " because it's required
[17:18:36] <re101-birman-82> You can remove them, I can organize the capturing groups on Zabbix later
[17:18:59] <digitok> i was just curious, sometimes ppl escape things for no reason
[17:19:04] <digitok> i don't need to remove them
[17:21:35] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/lIqIJ4/2
[17:22:24] <re101-birman-82> Cool, let me understand how you did it
[17:22:48] <digitok> this might help, https://regex101.com/r/lIqIJ4/3
[17:23:34] <digitok> basically i replaced each of the  .*?  with  (?:[^\"]+|\"(?!Method\"))*+
[17:23:35] <re101-birman-82> thank you
[17:23:42] <digitok> yw
[17:24:17] <digitok> what this does is match all chars that aren't " in one go, and if it finds a ", it checks that it isn't followed by  Method"
[17:24:37] <digitok> the *+ then prevents it from being able to backtrack into that group
[17:25:33] <digitok> with  .*?  it matches a single char at a time and then looks for the next thing, i.e.  (\"Method\":\"[A-Z]+\")
[17:25:38] <digitok> so on large data that's quite slow
[17:26:15] <digitok> it still isn't super efficient, since the data contains a lot of "
[17:26:23] <digitok> so it has to stop a lot
[17:28:06] <digitok> we can actually make it quite a bit more efficient, but it makes the regex a bit weird
[17:32:29] <digitok> it also wouldn't allow you to include the first quote in the capture
[17:37:24] <digitok> something like https://regex101.com/r/lIqIJ4/4
[17:37:35] <digitok> but the other one's probably better for you
[17:38:13] <digitok> also note that catastrophic backtracking on re101 doesn't mean it won't run elsewhere
[17:38:38] <digitok> but hopefully your log files won't be too much bigger than this

[19:29:34] <re101-macaw-40> you mean coding language?

[19:46:34] <digitok> the first one should return the whole table?
[19:47:04] <re101-macaw-40> Yes.
[19:47:46] <digitok> can we assume it starts at a line which starts with ESTeem? or do we need to check the whole line
[19:49:45] <digitok> and can we assume it ends at a blank line
[19:50:01] <digitok> like this https://regex101.com/r/dCteqy/3
[19:51:15] <re101-macaw-40> It wont end with a blank line but next line would be ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
[19:51:45] <re101-macaw-40> Table starts with Esteem
[19:52:21] <re101-macaw-40> But in the string esteem is not unique
[19:52:26] <re101-macaw-40> it may occure anywhere else
[19:53:02] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32)
[19:53:04] <digitok> so we should check the whole line?
[19:53:08] <DevAntoine> Hi
[19:53:35] <digitok> or maybe just a line that starts with  ESTeem Model Type
[19:53:37] <re101-macaw-40> I think its good to check the whole line
[19:54:03] <DevAntoine> Why "[A-Za-z]" match only chars while "[A-z]" matches special chars too?
[19:54:11] <digitok> like this https://regex101.com/r/dCteqy/5
[19:54:36] <digitok> !a-z @ DevAntoine
[19:54:37] <perlbot> DevAntoine: /[A-z]/ does not mean what you might think. You should use /[A-Za-z]/ or /[a-z]/i, unless you wish to include these characters: [ \ ] ^ _ `
[19:54:54] <re101-macaw-40> Yes digitok
[19:54:59] <DevAntoine> digitok: what does it mean then?
[19:55:27] <digitok> A-z is a character range of ascii 65 to 122
[19:55:40] <digitok> so between Z and a there are a few other chars
[19:55:47] <digitok> those listed above
[19:55:52] <DevAntoine> Oh, I see
[19:55:56] <DevAntoine> Thanks digitok!
[19:56:00] <digitok> yw :)
[19:56:06] <re101-macaw-40> digitok now we need to identify rows

[19:58:41] *** Joins: txtsd (~txtsd@user/txtsd)
[20:01:40] <re101-macaw-40> In the result matches we need to get individual rows like (210M Narrow Band Licensed 150 to 174 2 64.8 Kbps 15 Ethernet/RS-232)
[20:02:06] <digitok> yea i'm just asking if the regex will be applied to the whole data
[20:02:16] <digitok> or the result of the regex we just did
[20:02:31] <re101-macaw-40> For the result 
[20:03:13] <digitok> like you can't take the regex we just did for the whole table and just extract the lines i assume
[20:05:27] <re101-macaw-40> Now we can just use the table data as the string now and try to match the rows
[20:05:29] *** Quits: simbioz (~simbioz@user/simbioz) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:05:46] <re101-macaw-40> Yes you are right
[20:06:18] <digitok> so does it need to be regex?
[20:07:33] <re101-macaw-40> Yes
[20:08:38] <digitok> if we put all of the rows in a group can we use just that group to extract individual rows?
[20:08:43] <testuser[m]> How to match numbers instead of just single digits ([0-9]) ?
[20:09:17] <digitok> like this https://regex101.com/r/dCteqy/6
[20:09:18] <re101-macaw-40> Yes digitok
[20:09:40] <digitok> testuser[m], (\d+) or ([0-9]+)
[20:09:49] <testuser[m]> Thanks
[20:10:12] <digitok> yw
[20:10:21] <re101-macaw-40> This is getting the whole data 
[20:10:23] <digitok> and then this https://regex101.com/r/dCteqy/7
[20:10:33] <digitok> i know, i added a group 
[20:10:39] <digitok> which contains only the rows
[20:11:17] <re101-macaw-40> Yup
[20:12:26] <digitok> so you can apply the regex for the cells to that also
[20:12:33] <digitok> instead of to the whole data
[20:12:52] <re101-macaw-40> Yes got it.
[20:12:57] <re101-macaw-40> One last question
[20:13:10] <re101-macaw-40> Is it possible to identify column data instread of rows?
[20:13:35] <re101-macaw-40> Like first column, second column and soon
[20:13:52] <digitok> that's quite difficult
[20:14:45] <re101-macaw-40> It will be great if we can do that
[20:14:54] <digitok> lol
[20:15:23] <digitok> how do you mean exactly
[20:15:30] <digitok> how would it be returned
[20:16:12] <re101-macaw-40> each column data as one group
[20:17:05] <digitok> oh, like a group which contains more than one line?
[20:17:21] <re101-macaw-40> We can consider for one row, not for the whole table
[20:18:24] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/dCteqy/8
[20:18:41] <digitok> do you mean like this but 6 different regexes?
[20:18:50] <digitok> one for each part
[20:19:14] <re101-macaw-40> Yes
[20:20:11] <digitok> ok i'll post one at a tine

[20:51:31] <re101-macaw-40> lol
[20:52:21] <digitok> in the other examples column 4 seemed optional
[20:52:27] <digitok> is that right?
[20:52:43] <digitok> in this example they all have colum  4
[20:52:45] <digitok> column*
[20:54:31] <re101-macaw-40> No in other example column 4 has only numbers.  In the new example column 4 has ".250 (Dual Strcam) ". But nothing is optional. 
[20:55:15] <digitok> nope
[20:55:32] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/dCteqy/2
[20:55:34] <digitok> here
[20:55:41] <digitok> only the first 2 have column 4
[20:56:49] <re101-macaw-40> Ohh my bad. You are right
[20:57:25] <digitok> so it's optional right
[20:57:30] <re101-macaw-40> Yes
[20:57:43] <digitok> can it be 1.2?
[20:57:59] <re101-macaw-40> yes
[20:58:07] <re101-macaw-40> It has 2.5 in the last row
[20:58:22] <digitok> that's .25
[20:58:31] <re101-macaw-40> sorry .25
[20:58:58] <digitok> so can there be a . within the number or only at the start
[20:59:23] <digitok> i suppose we can just allow both
[20:59:29] <re101-macaw-40> Yes
[20:59:34] <re101-macaw-40> allow both
[20:59:48] <digitok> if there is other text after the number will it always be inside ()
[21:00:18] <re101-macaw-40> Correct
[21:00:59] <digitok> ok
[21:01:12] <digitok> and what about the ones that are 2 lines
[21:01:44] <digitok> we need to allow for that?
