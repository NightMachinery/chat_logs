[00:00:36] <Nistar> After I finish working through K&R C, does anyone have some recommendations for a book or some material for modern C developement, including organizing large projects, building and testing, defensive programming, etc?
[00:02:12] <Wulf> Nistar: perhaps look at cmake, cunit, doxygen, sphinx. No idea if there is good reading material for those.
[00:02:56] <Nistar> Sounds good, I'll just look into those projects. What about compilers? How do people decide on which to choose for their project?
[00:04:30] <Wulf> Nistar: there are only two relevant compilers, gcc and clang/llvm.
[00:05:00] <Wulf> Nistar: I believe you can configure which one to use through cmake.
[00:05:32] <Nistar> CLANG and LLVM are part of the same project?
[00:06:10] <Wulf> Nistar: I think clang is a part of llvm.
[00:07:25] <Nistar> Wulf: Thanks.
[00:08:06] <Nistar> How about resources for learning "enough assembly"?
[00:08:21] <Wulf> Nistar: enough for what?
[00:08:55] <twkm> the wiki has some more.
[00:09:17] <Nistar> To develop a deeper understanding of how C operates with hardware
[00:09:34] <makersmasher> no starch has a decent book....
[00:09:42] <clarity> You don't need to study assembly
[00:09:59] <clarity> If you need to do things with it, just look things up as you go and you'll learn just enough
[00:10:03] <Wulf> Nistar: write a few simple C functions and have a look at the assembly code that your compiler spits out
[00:10:21] <Nistar> makersmasher: _Art of 64-bit assembly_?
[00:10:30] <tk> I would argue that trying to understand how C operates with hardware is generally a bad idea unless you already know C very well, or at least have a healthy respect for the boundaries of your C knowledge and can stop yourelf from trying to fill in gaps in your C knowledge with your newfound understanding of hardware.
[00:10:32] <floatcomplex> don't bother learning assembly for x86_64
[00:10:47] <tk> Lots of bugs arise because people assume that C operates like a direct abstraction over their hardware
[00:10:47] <floatcomplex> learn aarch64 assembly because optimizing your code at that level actually matters
[00:11:20] <Nistar> tk: Oh that's an interesting view.
[00:11:26] <floatcomplex> x86_64 is both a turing tarpid and not worth optimizing for anyway
[00:11:27] <makersmasher> Nistar, yeah, art of assembly
[00:11:32] <floatcomplex> s/tarpid/tarpit/
[00:11:45] <makersmasher> listen to the others though, I am not an expert
[00:12:04] <chair1> Nistar: At the uni we read Patterson's book "Computer Organization and Design", it's all theory but introduces about MIPS assembly, how a CPU works, what is the pipeline and branch prediction, how the stack works etc.
[00:12:44] <makersmasher> I started learning asm because I wanted to be a RE/exploit developer
[00:13:05] <aosync> assembly is fun
[00:13:20] <makersmasher> ...and I've always wanted to write a custom NES game
[00:15:47] <Nistar> Right now I just want to learn enough C to the point where I could start my own projects, and manipulate OS-level things, and probably some CFFI stuff. I do want to get good at this language, though I don't yet know what I want to end up doing with it -- I've always found that expanding my tool repertoire allows me to take on bigger and bolder projects. And yeah, reverse engineering sounds very
[00:15:49] <Nistar> exciting, though that might be something I'd be into more as a hobby.
[00:16:26] <Nistar> It's kind of interesting seeing these posts on Hacker News where guys RE some old video game and discover unused assets and levels :-)

[00:20:20] <chair1> As you may have read on K&R, if you know the basics you can already start or contribute to big projects, C is rather simple and you can go very far with it, the rest is all functions and libraries to learn, and you learn as you need

[00:22:49] <Wulf> Nistar: game content is usually saved as data in files. Parse the files, understand the content and compare to the content you can see during normal game play.
[00:23:03] <chair1> Sorry, I've just checked the book, it says the opposite at Chapter 1. It covers the basics for simple programs but you need to learn the rest for bigger stuff lol
[00:23:23] <Wulf> Nistar: I guess finding out if content is actually inaccessible or just well hidden can be complicated

[04:12:44] <apotheon> Well . . . basically, it seems that a psychopath is kind of "naturally" an evil motherfucker, and a sociopath became that way at a very young age, possibly with a pre-existing susceptibility to it.  This tends to result in slightly different symptomologies, e.g. sociopaths often being glibly charming and convincing while psychopaths are often more cold.

[04:15:46] <apotheon> A sociopath might be better at charm because the sociopath wasn't born with no empathy, but rather ended up with it being withered away to almost nothing.
[04:15:48] <cousteau> well, in that case I cannot tell the motivations of people who write the code I have to deal with
[04:15:50] <apotheon> for instance
[04:15:59] <cousteau> I suspect most of the time it's incompetence
[04:16:25] <apotheon> yeah, incompetence is rampant

[12:01:52] <supakeen> And if it was the revers you wouldn't care (much) about the memory

[12:44:49] <loganlee> hi guys
[12:44:53] <loganlee> i did statistics at uni
[12:44:54] <caze> Your entropy rate is halaved.
[12:45:01] <caze> halved
[12:45:25] <tk> I also don't think that's true, if your change of getting heads is 0.99 then you're much more likely to get a long run of hh than you are to get a transition or a run of tt so you're surely throwing away more than 50%
[12:45:33] <tk> this would actually, be trivial to test
[12:46:06] <caze> So it's at best 50%.
[12:46:15] <tk> hmm
[12:46:21] <tk> I see what you're saying
[12:46:22] <caze> But you're getting hte idea now.
[12:46:33] <tk> so when you have an unbiased coin you throw away half the coin tosses
[12:46:46] <caze> No, you don't throw away any.
[12:46:47] <tk> but I was talking about other methods of unbiasing
[12:47:01] <tk> well yes, but if you were to apply that method of unbiasing to a fair coin
[12:47:02] <caze> WHy would you throw away any tosses with an unbiased coin?
[12:47:16] <tk> just at the limit caze
[12:47:21] <caze> Why would you apply that method?
[12:47:26] <tk> well you wouldn't
[12:47:34] <tk> but the fairer your unfair coin gets, that's the worst case scenario
[12:47:52] <caze> Best?
[12:48:07] <tk> hmm, yes
[12:48:10] <tk> best case scenario
[12:48:33] <tk> okay, so yes, the entropy rate is reduced, but the entropy is increased, 
[12:48:50] <tk> but the entropy rate is reduced more than the entropy is increased
[12:48:50] <caze> I don't see how it's increased.
[12:49:06] <tk> because now you have 1 bit of entropy and before you had less then 1 bit
[12:49:34] <caze> Oh, you mean if you tried to use the biased results?
[12:49:48] <tk> yes for example, you can calculate their entropy

[14:58:22] <slidercrank> vanell0pe, standard include files are in /usr/include/
[14:59:05] <slidercrank> or do you need headers for developing GUI apps?
[14:59:35] <vanell0pe> I would like to create screen without using SDL
[14:59:37] <slidercrank> they are still under the same directory. But there are many GUI toolkits. So no "standard" header
[15:00:38] <slidercrank> and not using GTK/Qt?

[18:01:07] <pample> makes sense, indeed it needs better indentation functions kinda look like big blocks. right that floating 1024.0 don't need to be floating, it's a remnant from when i had an issue with that function i was consistently 1MiB off free's output and tried lots of converting unsigned long to floats thinking the issue was linked to decimals being lots

[20:41:06] <fizzie> Don't skip over the "Feature Test Macro Requirements" section, it's not there just as a decoration.
[20:41:08] <Learath2> fizzie: I guess if he meant the gnu c compiler by gcc, the way it optimizes the divide to a shift could maaybe be considered a gcc internals question
[20:41:10] <twkm> not always, but hopefully they do.
[20:41:12] <floatcomplex> baltazar: it's a big hammer but _#define GNU_SOURCE and have done with it
[20:41:26] <twkm> stupid hammer too.
[20:41:56] <baltazar> hmm yes, apparently I need either `_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L` or `_GNU_SOURCE`
[20:42:14] <mort> _Generic is such a useless and badly thought through feature
[20:42:42] <floatcomplex> baltazar: so "#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L" and make sure it's before all of the #include statements in that file
[20:42:51] <baltazar> floatcomplex: sure, thanks
[20:43:22] <mort> maybe you want one macro which can call either an int version or a long version of a function; but if you use _Generic with those two cases, your program won't compile on systems where int and long are compatible types

[20:44:21] <floatcomplex> or in human words, whether it rounds toward zero or negative infinity
[20:44:29] <mort> replace int and long with your favourite types of choice which may be compatible in one compiler but not in another
[20:44:47] <mort> mingw implements a lot of types as typedefs of other types for example
[20:44:54] <johnjay> a lot of the C standard is basically shrugging and saying, dunno!

[20:47:53] <mort> it's so bad
[20:48:09] <fizzie> ISTR there's a few types that are explicitly called out as having to be aliases of standard rather than extended integer types, in which case the "solution" is to just have your _Generic expressions include all the standard integer types and no others.
[20:48:15] <floatcomplex> does mingw32 imply 32 bit or is it just legacy naming
[20:48:31] <mort> 32 bits
[20:48:39] <mort> I'm fairly sure
[20:48:44] <nomagno> Oooh, round towards negative infinity is "up" for negative numbers! Never understood that expression

[20:49:08] <johnjay> floatcomplex: i believe it is legacy naming
[20:49:16] <mort> so how do you make a _Generic macro which the user can pass either int or ssize_t
[20:49:22] <sham1> mingw64 is how you'd do it form modern platforms yes
[20:49:24] <johnjay> i've seen 64 bit tooling which still says mingw32 in the name

[20:50:19] <Learath2> I propose we make all standard integers typedefs of the exact-width types
[20:50:47] <mort> I wouldn't mind 
[20:50:47] <fizzie> If ssize_t is one of those types that has to be an alias of a standard integer type, by having cases for char, signed char, short, int, long and long long in the macro; then ssize_t has to match one of them.
[20:51:18] <floatcomplex> i don't disagree with the original assertion that _Generic is poorly thought out
[20:51:22] <mort> ssize_t doesn't have to be an alias afaik?
[20:51:29] <fizzie> Anyway, IIRC the rationale for _Generic is "provide a way for apps to do what <tgmath.h> does", not to be a general vehicle for type-generic programming.
[20:51:41] <floatcomplex> tgmath.h is poorly thought out too
[20:51:43] <sham1> _Generic is very underutilized because of that very thinf
[20:51:54] <sham1> If only it worked for structs

[20:55:31] <mort> contextually, that looks like an argument in favour of _Generic, but the contents sound like an argument against it 
[20:55:33] <fizzie> Also, _Generic does "work" for structs, it just has the *other* problem of requiring all the branches, even the non-evaluated ones, to be valid code with no constraint violations.
[20:56:12] <floatcomplex> mostly i want to be able to read other people's code and know what function they're calling by looking at the name of the function rather than after figuring out some possibly non-local type information for its arguments
[20:57:20] <Learath2> floatcomplex: hm, I don't see how type information can be non-local in C, it's always in the body right before the call or the signature
[20:57:32] <floatcomplex> Learath2: i mean at the call site
[20:57:53] <fizzie> ,cc struct foo { int x; }; void print_foo(struct foo foo) { printf("%d", foo.x); } struct bar { double d; }; void print_bar(struct bar bar) { printf(" %.2f", bar.d); } #define p(x) _Generic((x), struct foo: print_foo, struct bar: print_bar)(x) \n p((struct foo){ .x = 123 }); p((struct bar){ .d = 1.23 }); // works for structs

[20:58:06] <floatcomplex> whatever
[20:58:24] <floatcomplex> and by local i don't mean C scope, i mean human scope
[20:58:31] <Learath2> floatcomplex: I mean it's either local or it's file scope, not really too many places to look tho, no?
[20:58:51] <floatcomplex> Learath2: you'd be amazed at the creativity of humans when it comes to fucking this stuff up
[20:59:30] <Learath2> Ah, I guess it can be quite far if it's a struct member and/or the function is long. I see your point
[20:59:55] <Learath2> Seems I got too used to modern crutches like navigating around with ctags
[21:00:01] <floatcomplex> the underlying point is even a little bit of it can massively increase the cognitive burden when trying to debug other people's code
[21:00:19] <floatcomplex> even the POSSIBILITY of it is not free, regardless of whether it's used or not
[21:01:09] <floatcomplex> c is easy to debug in part because you don't have to think about whether that sort of thing is in play
[21:01:30] <floatcomplex> until people get cute with stuff like _Generic

[22:38:58] <caze> rahl: Just like the expression `2 + 3` is an int value. Nobody would argue that the expression is inherently an int object.
[22:39:05] <fizzie> C11 6.3.2.1p4: "A /function designator/ is an expression that has function type. Except when it is the operand of the -- unary `&` operator, a function designator with type 'function returning /type/' is converted to an expression that has type 'pointer to function returning /type/'." So both `myfunc` and `&myfunc` yield the same thing, a pointer to the function.
[22:39:38] <fizzie> The part that tends to confuse people sometimes is that so do `*myfunc`, `**myfunc`, `***myfunc` and so on.
[22:39:53] <nomagno> Interesting thing is it seems no matter how many times I dereference either one, it just doesn't change

[22:40:36] <caze> nomagno: fizzie just quoted you the part of the standard that requires every compiler to have that behavior.
[22:41:02] <fizzie> When you dereference a function pointer, you get a function designator, which converts back to a function pointer, which you can dereference again to get a function designator, and so on forever.

[22:54:26] <topside> quartz, think of it as just packing two 8-bit values into a single 16-bit variable.... the | is acting as "Adding" the lower 8-bit value to the 16-bit value which has all 0's for the lower 8 bits
[22:54:54] <topside> s/adding/combining
[22:55:01] <floatcomplex> also it's only guaranteed to be unique in the context of comparing it with other addresses of the same type
[22:55:03] <quartz> Ahhhhh I see it
[22:55:06] <quartz> Yeah thanks everyone
[22:55:06] <caze> rahl: The first thing to understand is that C effectively only has one dimensional arrays.
[22:55:11] <quartz> This was super helpful.
[22:55:37] <quartz> How are you guys so good at this? 
[22:55:46] <sham1> Practice
[22:55:50] <quartz> It takes most everyone in my class a long time to get an answer like that.
[22:56:05] <topside> quartz, taking the code literally and just writing it out by hand to see what it's doing :)
[22:56:32] <sham1> Also keep in mind that this is a literal meeting point of C programmers
[22:57:03] <sham1> Of course the density of people who can be described as "being so good at this" would be higher than almost everywhere
[22:57:30] <floatcomplex> sham1: this channel is a local minimum of shittiness at c, not necessarily the global one
[22:57:39] <sham1> Perhaps
[22:57:40] <constxd> especially when fizzie is around
[22:58:09] <sham1> Also I'm glad that someone picked up on that very specific wording :)
[22:59:13] <quartz> BRB
[22:59:28] <nomagno> floatcomplex: That sounds weird, which implementation method is this intended to cater to?
[23:00:19] <sham1> To only have your value in registers if you can help it
[23:00:37] <sham1> If you don't need to have an address for a value, you don't necessarily need to spill it

[23:01:23] <floatcomplex> nomagno: it's not really meant to cater to an implementation. it can make some optimizations possible. i don't remember the details but if the compiler knows that the set of possible pointed-to objects by a given pointer is finite, it can make some simplifying assumptions

[23:02:48] <rahl> tbf computers really do effectively only have 1d arrays ;)
[23:03:10] <sham1> What do you mean, cache is multi-level
[23:03:11] <floatcomplex> rowhammer cannot be fully understood with a 1-dimensional model of memory
