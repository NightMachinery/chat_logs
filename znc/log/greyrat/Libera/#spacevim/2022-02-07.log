[19:53:43] <SpaceVimBot_> <Hauke> There is a gitcommit plugin in `autoload/SpaceVim/plugins/gitcommit.vim` which seems to add autocomplete support for conventional commit messages. As I used vim it worked for my commit messages, but in neovim it doesn’t. I’m not 100% sure if this is the right place to look at, but does anyone have a hint how to enable it for neovim?
