[00:37:18] <EmberCrest> howdy y'all. can someone help me fix a command to get subtitles overlayed?
[00:37:35] <EmberCrest> ffmpeg -i "in.mkv" -map 0:4 -map 0:0 -c:v copy -map 0:2 -c:a copy  -filter_complex "scale2ref[0:4][0:0];[0:0][0:4]overlay" -vcodec libx264 -vprofile baseline -g 30 -strict -2 -f flv rtmp://10.0.0.74/show/stream
[00:38:20] <EmberCrest> output is that it cannot find a matching stream for "unlabeled input pad 1 on filter parsed_scale2ref_0"
[00:39:08] <JEEB> you are using input stream naming on the output side of scale2ref and input side of overlay
[00:39:11] <EmberCrest> stream 0:0 = video, stream 0:1 = english audio, 0:2 = jap audio, 0:4 and 0:5 are hdmv_pgs_subtitle
[00:40:40] <EmberCrest> JEEB: what is output vs. input naming?
[00:41:02] <JEEB> [input1][input2]FILTERS_HERE[output1][output2]
[00:41:19] <JEEB> you are giving it 0:4 and 0:0 on the *output* side of scale2ref
[00:41:44] <JEEB> I have no idea what filter_complex does if you don't specify input(s) for multiple input filter like scale2ref
[00:42:20] *** Quits: sosodank (~dankamong@199.185.175.96) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:42:45] <JEEB> "[0:s:0][0:v:0]scale2ref[sub_out][vid_out];[vid_out][sub_out]overlay[overlay_out]" -map "[overlay_out]"
[00:42:51] <JEEB> I think that should do what you want :P
[00:42:57] <JEEB> I utilized stream type selection
[00:43:04] <JEEB> 0:s:0 is the first subtitle stream
[00:43:08] <JEEB> 0:v:0 is the first video stream
[00:43:23] <EmberCrest> ah ok, this command is making a lot more sense..
[00:45:12] *** Joins: sosodank (~dankamong@199.185.175.96)
[00:46:03] <EmberCrest> JEEB: how does the "0:s:0" notation work? what if I wanted the second subtitle stream?
[00:46:15] <JEEB> last number is the number of the stream of that type
[00:46:17] <EmberCrest> which side has the significant number on it
[00:46:24] <EmberCrest> ah got it ok
[00:46:37] <JEEB> first is the input number, just like with just 0:4
[00:46:50] <JEEB> like if you have -i input1 -i input2
[00:46:53] <JEEB> then you have inputs 0 and 1
[00:47:19] <JEEB> also in theory in many cases you can skip the scale2ref
[00:47:34] <JEEB> since sub2video does configure itself according to the video resolution that it thinks it should match
[00:47:55] <JEEB> or well, the configured subpicture canvas resolution to be more exact if I recall correctly
[00:48:06] *** Joins: edman007 (~edman007@user/edman007)
[00:48:17] <JEEB> I've just had cases where broadcast subpictures go SD<->HD
[00:48:29] <JEEB> in which case the configured canvas size is not changed
[00:48:50] <JEEB> so scale2ref makes sure the canvas gets scaled to video res
[00:55:02] <EmberCrest> JEEB: interestingly, I got this command working, but only without -re'
[00:55:06] <EmberCrest> '-re' *
[00:56:06] <JEEB> which version?
[00:57:04] <EmberCrest> ffmpeg version 4.4-full_build-www.gyan.dev Copyright (c) 2000-2021 the FFmpeg developers built with gcc 10.2.0 (Rev6, Built by MSYS2 project)
[00:57:38] <JEEB> right
[00:57:42] <EmberCrest> it just hangs with -re
[00:57:56] <JEEB> this is in the 4.4 branch but there are no newer releases made from that branch yet http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=commit;h=70405dd7e31cd436e9ffa252124537df253a5dc3
[00:57:57] <EmberCrest> without, it works fine, but the speed is dramatically reduced
[00:58:10] <JEEB> uuhh
[00:58:14] <JEEB> -re is for limiting speed
[00:58:19] <JEEB> it literally sleep()s
[00:58:28] <JEEB> so re will not make things faster
[00:58:57] <JEEB> but yea, if you grab a build made from the 4.4 branch that most likely is fixed
[00:59:08] <JEEB> (in case you want the 4.4 release instead of master)
[00:59:10] <EmberCrest> i thought RE was supposed to be used for RTMP?
[00:59:43] <JEEB> re is utilized when emulating real-time output, you just made it sound like re made it go faster :P
[00:59:46] <JEEB> which it does not
[01:00:03] <EmberCrest> ah I see; it is for instances where the stream *can* get faster and you need it to slow down :P

[01:18:21] <patiga> Hey, I have a problem with my live stream via ffmpeg
[01:18:32] <patiga> When I just stream video, everything is fine
[01:19:02] <patiga> However, once I stream audio alongside it, the stream starts to lag a lot and is generally unwatchable
[01:19:20] <patiga> the output says "Thread message queue blocking; consider raising the thread_queue_size option (current value: 8)"
[01:20:04] <patiga> However, by raising that limit, the stream is delayed a lot more and for some reason the audio and video also got off-sync
[01:20:42] *** Quits: anotheruser (~user@45.130.86.2) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:21:01] <patiga> Is my assumption correct that apparently my computer has problems encoding my audio quick enough to keep up with the audio, since the video-queue is asking to be bigger in size?
[01:22:28] <patiga> I use "-f pulse -i streamsink.monitor" and later "-c:a aac -b:a 160k -ar 44100" (not sure if that very last part is still part of it
[01:24:00] <patiga> *Is my assumption correct that apparently my computer has problems encoding my audio quick enough to keep up with the video, since the video-queue is asking to be bigger in size?
[01:32:12] *** Quits: sosodank (~dankamong@199.185.175.96) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:33:14] <sfan5> audio encoding is so low-resource that it's very unlikely to be the bottleneck
[01:35:36] <patiga> Hm, so how can it be that with just the video alone I get a very low delay, but a high delay/that thread_queue_size problem with the audio?
[01:40:18] <patiga> I failed to find forum or stackoverflow/stackexchange posts about streams being slow caused by audio, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
[01:41:00] <patiga> ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1080 -framerate 60 -i :0.0+1920,0 -f pulse -i streamsink.monitor -vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -c:a aac -b:a 160k -ar 44100 -f rtsp -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://192.168.2.160:2121
[01:41:11] <patiga> this is the command I'm using
[01:42:34] <furq> patiga: did you apply -thread_queue_size to the right input
[01:43:38] <patiga> the message didn't appear afterwards, so I think I did. I'm gonna try again, sec
[01:43:46] <furq> it's per-input
[01:43:55] <furq> the warning message will say either x11grab or pulse
[01:44:09] <patiga> it said x11grab
[01:44:51] <furq> maybe worth trying to increase it on either or both inputs
[01:45:04] <furq> if it didn't appear when you only had x11grab
[01:51:45] <patiga> okay so it definitely fixed it and there doesn't seem to be any out-of-sync issues now, not sure what happened there last time
[01:52:10] <patiga> I increased the thread_queue_size only for x11
[01:52:51] <patiga> what I don't like is that the video delay while streaming goes from ~1 sec without audio to ~3.5 secs with audio
[01:53:16] <patiga> if you have any idea on how to approach that, that would be awesome furq :)
[01:54:21] <patiga> *correction its ~3 secs with audio
[01:54:41] <patiga> but with the low overhead of audio, it doesn't feel right
[01:55:02] <patiga> is combining the two streams that expensive?

[10:28:44] <furq> AaronBurr: it's possible but not with just ffmpeg, you'd need to script it
[10:28:50] <furq> i think there are scripts out there that do it
[10:29:40] <furq> jbg: you can set forced_key_frames but i don't know if you can update it on the fly like that
[10:31:25] <AaronBurr> thanks for confirming furq - saves me some time
[10:31:51] <furq> it's nontrivial because you need to match the codec parameters enough to make them concatenable
[10:32:42] <furq> iirc for h264 profile, level, refs, fps and timebase need to match
[10:32:46] <furq> maybe more stuff
[10:32:59] <AaronBurr> encodes are by me, so i can use same settings
[10:33:07] <furq> yeah that makes it a lot easier
[10:33:49] <furq> if you can just use all the same codec parameters then it's relatively easy, it works more or less as you'd expect
[10:33:57] <AaronBurr> or i can not care about 5 seconds of advertisements in my pvr file
[10:34:40] <AaronBurr> but it's nice to know i wasn't overlooking something in the docs
[10:36:04] <AaronBurr> finally getting around to scrunching a couple years of mpeg2
[10:36:38] <furq> might as well just take the opportunity to reencode it
[10:36:44] <furq> and presumably deinterlace it
[10:37:57] <AaronBurr> i'm going to h265, avg 650kbit/s @ 540p.  I rather like the impressionistic sense i get from h265 at this bitrate, but the 12mbit/s mpeg2 is so much more honest
[10:39:44] <AaronBurr> but 'honest' when considering the flood-lighting of 1960s tv like star-trek TOS is very 'who cares anyway'.
[10:40:19] <AaronBurr> it's cartoonish and scrunched h265 is just fine for that :)
[10:50:39] <AaronBurr> yadif seems fine for all my deinterlacing needs
[10:51:24] <furq> if you can be bothered to get vapoursynth set up then qtgmc is pretty amazing
[10:51:38] <AaronBurr> more clarity?
[10:51:54] <furq> fewer artifacts
[10:53:34] <furq> everything else i've tried leaves stairsteps on high-contrast diagonal lines
[10:54:23] <AaronBurr> i had it setup for experiments in motion-compensated high framerate interpolation
[10:54:28] <furq> but the main thing i like it for is badly deinterlaced dvds which i have a lot of
[10:54:33] <furq> the progressive repair mode is some kind of actual magic
[10:55:18] <AaronBurr> i'll have to check it out sometime.  do you know of a page that compares these?
[10:55:44] <furq> you need to see them in motion really
[10:56:05] <furq> lavfi does have nnedi but last i checked it was really slow and gave worse results
[10:56:16] <AaronBurr> is vertically scrolling credits a good test?
[10:56:34] <AaronBurr> or just horizontal motion
[10:56:35] <furq> anything where you can see artifacts with yadif/bwdif is a good test
[10:56:43] <AaronBurr> ok
[10:56:50] <furq> like i said high contrast angled lines

[13:41:33] <JEEB> jbg: if you utilize the API you can set the pict_type in the AVFrame you're feeding to the encoder to AV_PICTURE_TYPE_I (which is sub-optimal since it doesn't actually note "random access point", but various encoder wrappers like libx264 then tell the encoder to set those to random access point)
