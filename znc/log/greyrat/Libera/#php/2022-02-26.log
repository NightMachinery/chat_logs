[02:14:06] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[02:17:04] <ordos> Albright, hah yeah we hit that one last year too
[02:17:13] <ordos> a first in 15+ years of php dev
[02:17:17] <Albright> ordos: Care to share how?
[02:17:30] <ordos> A poorly designed web form, conducting a survey
[02:17:39] <ordos> had around 10k fields
[02:18:33] <Albright> In my case I'm using a JS widget that lets you nest things hierarchically so each item has ID and parent fields… and my client is creating a lot more items/categories than is probably sane
[02:18:33] <ordos> picture a table, around 30 rows of data points, but duplicated across a couple hundred columns - the number of columns was variable (based on the number of staff at a company)
[02:19:02] <ordos> good lord make that 25+ years
[02:19:05] <Albright> Sounds like data with a non-predictable structure. Fun.
[02:19:06] * ordos feels old
[02:19:33] <Albright> Ha, let's see… Guess it's been about 20 years for me if you count when I started learning just for fun.
[02:19:38] <ordos> Albright, "my client is creating a lot more items/categories than is probably sane" - sounds like our client ^_^
[02:20:39] <ordos> in their defence, it's interesting data (salary survey across governmental departments), it's being put to good use, but good grief, 10k fields in a web form? Painful.
[02:21:54] <ordos> yeah I just double-checked their .ini config, max_input_vars = 10000
[02:21:56] <ordos> 0_o
[02:22:22] <ordos> Albright, if I recall, it took us a while to diagnose the problem, totally blind-sided us
[02:22:52] <Blondie101010> some designs handle many fields properly...  it's all a matter of design
[02:23:10] <Albright> My local dev server had a very helpful warning right at the top of the page telling me what the issue was, but the staging server didn't even though that should have all the errors turned on too.
[02:23:28] <Albright> "Warning" in the PHP sense.
[02:23:35] <Blondie101010> well errors should not be displayed to visitors :S
[02:23:45] <Albright> *Staging* site. :P
[02:23:59] <Blondie101010> right :)
[02:24:27] <ordos> Blondie101010, yeah agreed, it's a well designed form for what that's worth, but us rusty fools took a while to diagnose the issue

[02:56:57] <ordos> Albright, Blondie101010, that was actually a cool story now that I think about it. My team, despite failing newbifically with that max_input_vars oversight, nevertheless got to play around with croppie.js and using Imagick::FILTER_LANCZOS to downsample uploaded profile photos for 10k+ staff across several hundred departments simultaneously (these online national censuses get launched to everyone on the same day; day 1's influx of POST requests is nuts). We got
[02:56:57] <ordos> some decent compression out of that algo. Lessons were learnt ^_^

[22:41:01] <Dr-007> my question: ive found a class online thats not build for this framework. its a class that uses a bunch of regex's to find a name in a string
[22:41:08] <Dr-007> would i make a controller of this thing?
[22:41:22] <Dr-007> should i put it in a completely directory and then just import it or something?

[22:44:02] <Dr-007> what would you guys name the directory tho?
[22:44:54] <da_wunder> hmm, I would not use some `include` use laravel DI for that
[22:45:56] <Dr-007> this guy named it 'Classes' which is also very generic
[22:46:12] <Dr-007> like what term is best suitable for online found classes

[22:46:19] <Dr-007> 'ExternalClasses' or something
[22:49:43] <da_wunder> still I would recommend you to use laravel DI for that - https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container
[22:50:27] <Dr-007> oh, i didnt realize you meant that
[22:50:32] <Dr-007> i thought name it 'DI'
[22:50:37] <Dr-007> ill have a look, thanks
[22:54:55] <Dr-007> ah, thats basicly what im doing. but i notice some different things that might come in handy
[22:57:23] <da_wunder> note that there is no need for any "include" - just inject your service where you need to use that
[23:01:28] <Dr-007> yep, it works! :)
[23:01:52] <Dr-007> i also had to define the namespace App\MyExternalUndecidedFOldernameClasses;
[23:02:07] <Dr-007> but no need for include
[23:02:21] <Dr-007> so it crawls all files then?
[23:02:25] <Dr-007> every time the app loads?
[23:02:26] <da_wunder> that is how PSR-4 autoload works

[23:04:39] <Dr-007> ok, thanks for your help. and i now realize that it doesnt crawl all files. it just uses those in the top i defined with 'use App\MyExternalUndecidedFOldernameClasses\MyClass'
[23:08:04] <Blondie101010> that's PSR-4 autoloading
[23:09:15] <Dr-007> yeah, pretty nice. thats why i went with laravel. (didnt know it was called like that)
[23:09:32] <Dr-007> that and their good documentation

[23:43:44] <da_wunder> Dr-007: just to reminder - DI is quite common in different frameworks - that is not just Laravel, eg. Symfony uses it - and what is making that really happen in Composer because that register PSR-4 autoloading for those
[23:44:58] <Dr-007> ok, thanks. ive used laravel a few years ago and i am building this home automation site. which works now, and i build it just in vanilla php / smarty. but now i want to open it up to the web. so i figured ill move it to laravel
[23:45:12] <Dr-007> so i have to dig up some stuff when i go
[23:45:25] <Dr-007> or more or less, find out how to do it
[23:45:47] <Dr-007> but its coming along nicely thanks to composer and artisan.
[23:46:01] <Dr-007> and git
[23:46:15] <Dr-007> when composer creates files then git is really handy
[23:46:33] <da_wunder> next phase is to drop that smarty - laravel has is own templating system as does eg. symfony
[23:47:19] <Dr-007> yeah, thats gone with this new version
[23:47:37] <Dr-007> im using laravel's api / backend for managing. and vueJS for the frontend that uses that api
[23:47:48] <Dr-007> but years ago i used blade in laravel
[23:47:52] <Dr-007> which was okay too
[23:48:05] <da_wunder> and also if you're just moving from vanilla php to some framework - I would really recommend you to try out different frameworks and see what suites best for you
[23:48:30] <Dr-007> yeah, i installed symfony at first
[23:49:01] <Dr-007> but then i started thinking ahead and googled about their cronjobs. and the symfony documentation just lacked in displaying what i wanted to achieve
[23:49:15] <Dr-007> laravel was more elaborate about it. so i choose laravel
[23:49:20] <da_wunder> for me symfony is a lot more clearer than laravel
[23:49:36] <Dr-007> ok, funny that is
[23:49:48] <da_wunder> and for eg. those cronjobs, with symfony you just create cli command that you use in your crontab
[23:50:11] <da_wunder> it's just a command that you want to run with cronjob
[23:50:29] <Dr-007> ok, id like to have my cron available in the web admin in the end
[23:50:46] <Dr-007> but for now ive got `php artisan cron:FileImportCron`
[23:50:47] <da_wunder> there are multiple bundles in symfony for that

[23:53:02] <Dr-007> nice, thanks.
[23:54:04] <Dr-007> i havent put anything in the laravel `schedular` because i figured 'but then its hardcoded'
[23:54:15] <Dr-007> so ive got a few things to seek out
[23:55:53] <da_wunder> and really cronjobs should not be configured by an application user - imho
[23:55:56] <Dr-007> right now im moving the website from my raspberry pi 1 to my server thats alot quicker. i just made a 'www' partition on the ssd drive
[23:56:15] <Dr-007> the pi pissed me off because it was kinda slow. hehe, so thats what im doing right now
[23:56:33] <da_wunder> if you need to do "something" after "something else" has happening in your application, then use queues and workers
[23:56:41] <Dr-007> da_wunder, yeah if that application is aimed at somebody else other then me
[23:57:23] <Dr-007> but maybe ill let that plan sail in the end
[23:57:32] <da_wunder> you just dispatch a "message" to queuee like "hey I did thing X, now thing Y should happen" - and then your "worker" gets that message and process that as you like
[23:59:01] <da_wunder> and for thing like that I would just use eg. https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html - I bet that laravel has something similar and if not then that is really sad
[23:59:39] <Dr-007> ok, ill keep it in mind. since there is a second action that needs to be done after my FileImportCron has run. but since this FileImportCron imports filepaths to the database i figured ill make a second cron that just iterates over the database filepaths and then does its magic. but this worker sounds more like this is made for it
