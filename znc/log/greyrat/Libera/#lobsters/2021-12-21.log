[19:18:41] <companion_cube> probably a bit better than java, but still, wtf
[19:18:43] <dimadima> any thoughts on why they tried to coup JS?
[19:18:59] <companion_cube> they wanted gradual typing iirc? maybe perfs, too

[23:46:09] <pe> From what I've seen of Qt and KDE code, they're both written in a hackish way.
[23:46:13] <pe> Not unusual for C++.
[23:46:50] <pe> GNOME is written much more carefully, but it turns out to not help a lot.
[23:47:37] <companion_cube> otoh serenity OS is in C++, and it seems to work really well for them
[23:47:42] <pe> I wonder if Qt also has like 3 to 5 people who do 99% of the real work.
[23:51:44] <feoh> JordiGH: Depends on who you count as "People". Qt is a HUGE commercial success, and the KDE ecosystem is thriving so 🤷
[23:52:29] <wink> pe: my problem has always been that gtk stuff is a mess to use while Qt actually just works
[23:53:01] <JordiGH> KDE is thriving?
[23:53:05] <wink> that is from using the binding in python and other languages
[23:53:12] <JordiGH> I feel like I should know more people using KDE.
[23:53:15] <feoh> pe: I sometimes wonder how a project Gnome's size can possibly succeed as well as it has being written in C. Just trying to wrap your head around some of the data structures at play can be kind of boggling, even for someone who knows C.
[23:53:17] <JordiGH> Do any of YOU use KDE?
[23:53:20] <wink> and when I did C++... Qt was really nice and made it feel like Java and not lke C
[23:53:26] <JordiGH> Or Plasma or whatever it's called.
[23:53:52] <feoh> JordiGH: When I use Linux I use KDE/Plasma. Their accessibility features aren't flat busted like Gnome's :(
[23:54:18] <JordiGH> Isn't it "KDE Plasma" or something? KDE is the org, Plasma is the product?

[23:55:09] <feoh> Plasma has consistently had key chorded full screen zoom for decades, and Gnome only recently-ish added it and now it's been broken for the last two years and the 2 devs who understand the code enough to fix it don't have the cycles because it only matters if you're disabled.
