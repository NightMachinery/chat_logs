[02:10:31] <mockturtle> The Pushback Effects of Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Age in Code Review [practices programming] (thrgamon) https://lobste.rs/s/eefl39
[02:18:55] <kronk> neat paper, but is it on-topic?
[02:19:21] <kronk> >Latinx
[02:19:25] <kronk> way to piss off a population.
[02:19:56] <drakonis> this is going to make a nice hellthread
[02:20:16] <kronk> while it's based around the concept of a code review, it's really about perception.
[02:20:24] <kronk> and race, so it's off-topic.
[02:21:58] <kronk> it's also not an analysis of the code review patterns in general, but of the ones at Google.
[02:22:27] <kronk> so not only is it a piss-poor representation of the larger issue (because your data set is so small), it's not representative of all companies.
[02:22:42] <kronk> you've concluded google may have a problem. you haven't arrived at the general case.
[02:24:15] <kronk> google is not the rest of the world. I can guarantee you that at Amazon most of the pushback is going to be among your fucking peers because some may be anal retentive and some may be permissive.
[02:31:20] <JordiGH> Hey, how do websites know if they should show dark mode or not?
[02:31:28] <JordiGH> ddg suddenly turned light to me, and I wonder why.
[02:32:06] <amazigh> https://mdn.io/darkmode
[02:32:15] <amazigh> might help
[02:34:28] <moose> JordiGH: It's the NSA's proxy not working correctly.
[02:34:38] <kronk> arm the foil hat!
[02:34:42] <amazigh> ^^'
[02:35:38] <moose> Foil works quite well but only if you seal it around the ridge of your head. You can't have any gaps. Tuck it under the ears.
[02:35:40] <JordiGH> kronk: Chill out with the latinx thing, btw.
[02:35:53] <kronk> JordiGH: ?
[02:35:55] <JordiGH> Yeah, it's kind of silly, but it's not guaranteed that verborrhea.
[02:36:00] <JordiGH> *warranted
[02:36:30] <kronk> sorry, I have first-hand accounts that it's not an appropriate term from actual latinos.
[02:37:02] <kronk> either way it's off-topic.
[02:37:18] <moose> imode's reply was pretty top tier tbh
[02:38:17] <kronk> thanks.
[02:38:20] <edk> i would be amazed if the problem they're talking about doesn't exist tbh
[02:38:39] <kronk> it definitely doesn't, but we're thankful it's localized.
[02:38:46] <kronk> err, it definitely *DOES
[02:38:48] <kronk> it does exist.
[02:39:16] <kronk> there were a few interesting teams at amazon that I passed up offers from because of that.
[02:39:46] <edk> i think it's off-topic in any case tbh
[02:39:50] <kronk> +1.
[02:40:24] <edk> it's important and there should be conversations about it but the problem is not unique to tech nor particularly technical in nature
[02:40:35] <JordiGH> I mean, the very definition of "latino" is usually a US thing.
[02:40:37] <edk> so i think those conversations should take place somewhere that is not lobsters
[02:40:49] <moose> Right, it's an article about equality framed in technology rather than something unique to technology that happens to be about equality
[02:40:57] <kronk> yeah replace "code review" with any other artifact.
[02:41:28] <kronk> product design will probably have some similar patterns.
[02:41:51] <moose> It does. I've talked to a UX guy who did backpacks about it at length heh.
[02:41:52] <amazigh> still an interesting convo. Too bad we are technical focus, and company-wide flow of focused productivity in software departement is of not interest to lobsters.
[02:42:13] <edk> too good
[02:42:18] <kronk> ##crustaceans welcomes you.
[02:42:30] <moose> is it on topic in crustaceans?
[02:42:39] <edk> IRC is a bit better than the site for this, but i basically really don't want to talk to a bunch of techbros about any sort of social issue
[02:42:45] <kronk> all things including doomscrolling and complaining about real-estate are on-topic.
[02:42:51] <JordiGH> You guys really are pissed off by someone mentioning race, huh.
[02:42:57] <moose> edk: tbh that is more harmful than this article js
[02:43:07] <kronk> pardon, JordiGH?
[02:43:38] <JordiGH> Like, you guys have spent about 20f minutes loudly proclaiming how offtpoic this is and how we shouldn't be talking about it while you keep talking about it and saying how irrelevant this is.
[02:44:00] <kronk> perhaps read the responses a little closer, I have a feeling you've come to the wrong conclusion about the vibe here.
[02:44:14] <amazigh> that is not strictly technical the pratice flag is there
[02:44:18] <JordiGH> The vibe is "don't talk about this".
[02:44:25] <kronk> yes, because it's off-topic.
[02:44:31] <amazigh> +1 JordiGH
[02:44:43] <kronk> so go to ##crustaceans and talk about it there. :P
[02:44:51] <JordiGH> Yeah, where no one will see it.
[02:44:52] <moose> JordiGH: May I PM?
[02:44:56] <JordiGH> Because this isn't worthy of conversation.
[02:45:07] <JordiGH> Yeah, what's up moose?
[02:45:08] <kronk> I do not understand what you are angry at.
[02:45:24] <edk> i'm sorry for using your air to express my incorrect opinions JordiGH
[02:45:35] <edk> since we all agree that we don't need to talk about this maybe we can move on
[02:45:49] <JordiGH> I'm annoyed by how you guys are saying how unworthy of mainstream discussion this is. While you guys all go on to state your opinions about it.
[02:46:17] <kronk> we agreed that it wasn't worth discussing. that requires a conversation.
[02:46:31] <JordiGH> We didn't agree shit, but whatever.
[02:46:31] <kronk> it would've been the terminal point of the conversation if you didn't resurrect it.
[02:46:38] <amazigh> |:
[02:46:39] <kronk> either way, ##crustaceans, and I suggest you chill out.
[02:47:24] <amazigh> I will take another coffee to become hopefuly a l33t
[02:47:36] <kronk> caffeine is the door opener.
[02:47:38] <moose> I think it being off-topic and being not worth discussion are vastly different things.

[04:02:26] <albertito> I saw it a few days ago and thought it was a really interesting paper; of course it just talks about one company but I think it's useful to see that type of thing analyzed like that. It's not going to solve all problems, but it's interesting

[17:41:07] <banna> my time with messing around with tab completion scripts is upsetting
[17:42:20] <banna> I find the tab completion script collections usually useful... but the amount of work some of those scripts can end up spinning is a bit crazy.
[17:43:18] <banna> I opt to use basic tab completion that is extremely predictable, and simplistic. Otherwise it's just dissonance.
[17:44:05] <banna> that is - tab completion that only resolves directories on currently mounted filesystems, and looking for names in your path.
[17:44:45] <banna> anything more just gets in my way, usually.
