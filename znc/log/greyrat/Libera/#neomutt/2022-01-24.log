[14:06:51] <gour> well, i'm interesting to mimic, as much as possible, behaviour of notmuch's emacs client by depending more on tags than on the folder-based approach

[14:09:58] <jindraj> gour: spcifically? About the custom-tags I'm not using them, too much work. I use tag-transforms instead. The only thing I wanted custom-tags for was the specific order (notmuch tags are usually shown alphabetically). 
[14:10:37] <jindraj> I'm not familiar with the emacs notmuch integration. I've seen some video recently, but I'm emacs virgin :D
[14:11:20] <gour> jindraj: what does tag-transforms provide? does it handle just ordinary imap-supported flags or something else i'm not aware?
[14:11:29] <gour> anyone using afew?
[14:12:08] <gour> jindraj: i wantedto use emacs-based workflow, but, simply returned back 😉
[14:12:43] <jindraj> gour: tag-transforms allows to rename the tag name. I use it to substitute tag names with emojis
[14:14:05] <gour> jindraj: aha...that really looks cool in you setup!
[14:14:24] <jindraj> what imap flags do you mean? since notmuch needs maildir there are no imap flags unfortunately. But with gauteh/lieer you can have gmail to maildir with bidirectional syncing notmuch tag to gmail label
[14:16:26] <flatcap> morning all
[14:17:02] <gour> jindraj: well, i just wonder what do you mean you're not using "custom-tags"? you don't add arbitrarily (custom) tags? i'm not so interested for gmail accounts -they're just spare ones, but planning to deploy afew and muchsync to mimic my setup on the 2nd (netbook) machine
[14:17:10] <gour> morning flatcap 
[14:20:16] <flatcap> hi gour 
[14:29:43] <jindraj> gour: I'm sorry I was wrong. I do use custom-tags :) I was confused and haven't cross check the docs. I was talking about tag-formats which I don't use. Otherwise I do use hidden_tags, tag-transforms and the functions modify-labels-then-hide + modify-labels

[15:40:31] <flatcap> bitigchi: Welcome to NeoMutt
[15:41:22] <merv> flatcap: A quick question. What mailbox format does neomutt uses by default? Is it mbox?
[15:41:34] <merv> flatcap: A quick question. What mailbox format does neomutt use by default? Is it mbox?
[15:42:33] <flatcap> the default is mbox, config:  set mbox_type = "mbox"
[15:43:09] <flatcap> if you save to a non-existent folder, that's what'll be created
[15:43:29] <merv> Can i change it to maildir?
[15:43:38] <merv> following http://www.elho.net/mutt/maildir/
[15:43:56] <flatcap> set mbox_type = "maildir"  (as you probably guessed)
[15:44:16] <merv> Yes, but does that cause any problem to current setup?
[15:44:56] <merv> Sorry i should've directly asked this main question.
[15:45:06] <flatcap> shouldn't do.  neomutt works out what sort of folder it is by file type
[15:45:23] <flatcap> it only affects saving to non-existent places
[15:46:42] <merv> Nice. Thanks flatcap.
[15:47:06] <flatcap> np
[15:58:05] <gour> jindraj: thanks! will take advantage of the offering when I'm going to tackle that setup

[17:20:53] <gour> jindraj: just a short question: i see you have kind of 'return-receipt' setup in your config. what is it?
[17:24:52] <jindraj> gour: setting Disposition-Notification-To header so folks using some mail clients can click that they've read the message. It's a little annoying for them, but a lot of people clicks on that. It's easier remind old emails, they can't say they didn't receive the message nor read it :D
[17:26:07] <gour> jindraj: yeah, i'm aware of 'return-receipt' and was wodnering if it is possible to do it with (neo)mutt. can you trigger it by mail or it is always fired?

[17:30:47] <jindraj> I'm adding it to all messages, but I do remove it often. It's easier and faster to manually remove it than to add it :). I keep it mostly in work related messages.
