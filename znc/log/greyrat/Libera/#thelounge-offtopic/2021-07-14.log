[00:10:01] <bookworm> if you've been on IRC since a while, it shouldn't be hard to understand topic based channels
[00:10:20] <bookworm> and why they are useful and why they should be kept mostly on topic
[00:10:34] <aab_> peekaboo
[00:10:37] <bookworm> heck, that's how other kinds of things also work... forums / reddit / 4chan...
[00:10:54] <aab_> they do
[00:22:10] <lous1F> ok now we're off topic
[00:22:20] <Snuupy> you were off topic a long time ago
[00:22:23] <lous1F> a/s/l
[00:22:53] <aab_> this isn't msn
[00:23:28] <aab_> what you talking about "REDACTED FOR PRIVACY" ?
[00:23:47] <lous1F> whois thelounge.chat
[00:24:03] <lous1F> in a terminal
[00:24:30] <aab_> does that really matter? a host can be anyone that's not really relevant to anything
[00:24:40] <aab_> and that's for GDPR 
[00:24:51] <aab_> depends on what location you are in 
[00:25:39] <lous1F> I know, that's why I've moved my domains from a us registrant
[00:26:08] <aab_> I see, you can purchase privacy if you really want it on most hosts
[00:26:22] <aab_> some require you to put in real information in some don't.
[00:26:28] <aab_> as some do further checks
[00:26:50] <aab_> also depends on what TLD you want to purchase as well
[00:27:32] <lous1F> I bought my birth name in every TLD I could, and have whois privacy for them. but what is the point of that, really.. heh
[00:28:25] <aab_> you probably missed 1423498345907235874298 domains for your second name, guarantee it.  Very expensive as well.
[00:28:38] <lous1F> but if you're processing any data through that domain, it's best to have GDPR compliant *everything
[00:28:49] <lous1F> including the registrar
[00:28:54] <aab_> sure
[00:30:32] <lous1F> and Donuts Inc.
[00:37:52] <lous1F> p.s. I was threatened by some corporation that has my irl name copyrighted. I was told I can't sell/market *subject*
[00:38:51] <lous1F> so using your name for your website could be infringing on some copyright,..
[00:40:24] <lous1F> I just want to know who mark monitor is..?
[00:41:21] <aab_> probably spam
[00:41:36] <lous1F> whois google.com
[00:42:00] <lous1F> whois the registrar of google com
[00:42:13] <aab_> I get devs emailing me ask if I wanted a web developer to develop my website
[00:42:17] <lous1F> whois markmonitor
[00:43:32] <lous1F> aab_, what is their usual pitch
[00:44:13] <aab_> tell me they are a professional designer from india and can code in *bullet point list
[00:45:24] <lous1F> it looks fine as it is,.. are they suggesting they could make it look better?
[00:45:43] <aab_> dunno
[00:46:19] <lous1F> I know though, a lot of people from india just got online and know all sorts of code
[00:47:11] <aab_> my reply is funny though, I email asking if their wife would like some fun. lol, I don't get any more spam after that.
[00:47:28] <aab_> my web dev spam has slowed down a bit since replying like that lol
[00:48:33] <lous1F> lots of people are just getting on the web for the first time, I recently read an issue on some repo on github and the person said they're running win XP
[00:48:52] <aab_> meh
[00:50:00] <lous1F> yeah, I give funny replies. if anything I teach them a thing or two and say no thanks
[00:50:35] <lous1F> most people on earth can't speak/read english
[00:50:38] <aab_> hehe

[00:51:53] <lous1F> I've never been called "Dear" so much in my life..
[00:51:58] <lous1F> lol
[00:53:22] <aab_> that's usually the first line on my emails I receive from the web dev lol
[00:54:56] <lous1F> it's china and/or india lost in translation
[00:55:33] <lous1F> but I've heard it mostly from people selling hardware from china, it's "chinglish"
[00:56:19] <aab_> indeed

[00:58:54] <lous1F> I was chatting with some dude in china, he said if the government found out he was chatting online he would get arrested..
[00:59:50] <lous1F> he was using an android device using a vpn, I sent him the link to download the orbot apk
[01:01:12] <lous1F> I just told him be careful
[01:02:07] <aab_> they will come after you next lol
[01:02:46] <lous1F> prob not
[01:03:05] <lous1F> I'll make them bored
[01:03:07] <lous1F> lol
[01:03:09] <aab_> I'm just kidding
[01:06:24] <aab_> hey MaxLeiter you just showed up on the IRC.com app on apple as a reviewer lmao! 
[01:07:06] <aab_> love it lmao - https://i.imgur.com/uGlTfSg.png
[01:08:20] <lous1F> lol
[01:09:58] <lous1F> irc - sign in with your google or face account
[01:10:36] <aab_> Some of you remember myspace right? 
[01:10:42] <lous1F> yes
[01:11:07] <aab_> could you imaging if myspace, facebook merged back in the time.  You could tell people to "cum on myface" :D
[01:11:15] <lous1F> I'm still trying to get my data back from a company in that era
[01:11:16] <aab_> badum tish!...
[01:11:53] <lous1F> haha good1
[01:13:01] <lous1F> somebody invited me to "gmail" this new email website. that is the whole reason I ever signed up 
[01:13:12] <aab_> I remember that
[01:13:22] <aab_> I got a beta invite as well
[01:13:45] <aab_> I actually got an invite from someone on DC++ you remember that as well?
[01:13:47] <lous1F> ~2004-5
[01:14:07] <lous1F> don't know dc++
[01:14:15] <aab_> i see
[01:21:05] <lous1F> maybe I do, I am re-discovering stuff from 10-20yrs ago
[01:21:53] <lous1F> the web has evolved into some weird thing,.. just in the past year even
[01:23:54] <lous1F> meanwhile, trying to stay current and learning things from 2017 or 2012 that are just as relevant now
[01:25:28] <aab_> web is no different to what it was back in time it's just more fancy websites and faster network connections
[01:26:20] <lous1F> it's just more people (noobs) online now
[01:26:26] <lous1F> everywhere. lol
[01:27:36] <lous1F> I can't take advantage of poor innocent people like *billion$corporation
[01:27:39] <aab_> I wouldn't say that was true, there are many places where people who used to hang out in msn chat rooms and yahoo icq e.t.c are kicking about
[01:31:21] <lous1F> came across this the other day. it's really showing itself in 2021  https://www.osalt.com/2012/06/today-the-future-of-internet-begins---and-open-source-is-ready
[01:33:18] <aab_> when ipv4 was assigned to my net I first got a block of 8 ip address
[01:33:37] <aab_> maybe they might do the same once ipv6 becomes mainstream
[01:40:36] <lous1F> "IPv6 solves the IP address issue simply by introducing a new type of IP address that can handle 3.4e+38 - or 4 billion times 4 billion times 4 billion times 4 billion. It a huge number - difficult for most people to understand. But lets just assume that we will not be running out of IP address ever again. "

[02:20:00] <aab_> it all depends how many devices people have the more devices the faster they will run out
