[00:15:44] <pl> there was for example a pretty popular Jabber client in Tcl/Tk
[00:17:44] <CodeBitCookie[m]> pl: Woowwwww, it works right of the bat, I just created it and it immediately ran just like nuklear! Except, this is much more popular ANDDD https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/styles.html
[00:18:03] <CodeBitCookie[m]> It might just be the GUI Framework I use.
[00:18:55] <pl> personally I was going to investigate Tcl/Tk sometime soon again, with possibly writing GUI completely in Tcl while having "business logic" in CL, linked with CORBA
[00:19:11] <CodeBitCookie[m]> The live coding part is also settled with `(start-wish)`
[00:19:51] <CodeBitCookie[m]> pl: CORBA? Except for the long accronym that flew over my head, what is it?

[00:55:04] <CodeBitCookie[m]> True, and most linux users won't care much, if they do care I will maybe add an option for theming?
[00:56:21] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Anyways I have to go sleep. Hopefully LTK or nodgui works for me since this is my last hope, after this I either ditch Common Lisp for GUI Programming or create a GUI framework from scratch in OpenGL. This is very darastic I know.

[12:05:52] <semz> How portable are CL pathnames in practice? I like their idea a lot but do the implementations agree on how to interpret them?
[12:08:14] <jackdaniel> no, there are noticeable differences between implementations

[12:09:08] <jackdaniel> logical pathnames are also super cool, but they are even less trustworthy :)
[12:11:45] <semz> Can these differences be worked around sanely or do they render pathnames effectively unusable?
[12:12:05] <semz> In a portable library that is, obviously you can use them if you stick to your impl
[12:13:23] <lisp123> Nilby: do you use eww?
[12:13:24] <jackdaniel> people work with pathnames with success, but you need to be vary of things symlinks and whether #P"/foo/bar"  when there is a bar directory will be treated as a file or a directory
[12:13:34] <jackdaniel> wary?
[12:13:44] <jackdaniel> wary!
[12:14:22] <semz> Maybe I need to vary too, just like the interpretations do.
[12:14:56] <jackdaniel> there are a few libraries that aim at providing portable interepation of pathnames

[12:40:27] <holycow> i'm trying to get more serious about lisp and expand my knowledge of emacs
[12:40:36] <holycow> i am really confused about the inferior-lisp buffer
[12:40:51] <White_Flame> it's the stdout of the lisp process
[12:41:02] <holycow> oh
[12:41:26] <White_Flame> or actually, the full terminal session, as if it drops to ldb at some point, you can type in it, too
[12:41:39] <holycow> is it supposed to provide access to a command-prompt at all to evaluate a form?
[12:41:49] <White_Flame> only when something goes wrong with slime
[12:42:03] <White_Flame> other than that, it's basically just to monitor anythign that escapes capture into SLIME
[12:42:21] <White_Flame> it used to be that threaded output to *standard-output* would go to inferior lisp, but I think that's captured into the main slime repl window now
[12:42:28] <holycow> ah okay now i understand my confusion
[12:42:41] <holycow> okay so i have been playing with packages testing dumping images
[12:43:07] <holycow> online documentation says switch to inferiorlisp buffer and dump the image from there because you cannot do it from a slime session in emacs
[12:43:22] <White_Flame> ah, righ
[12:43:27] <holycow> what are they really saying then? inferior-lisp doesn't proved a command prompt to evaluate a form?
[12:43:38] <White_Flame> any time I've dumped an image, I've done it from the OS commandline, with a little load & dump script

[12:44:16] <White_Flame> I don't know what they mean.  It could be from an older version, or it could be that they launch it as slime does, but without the slime parts?
[12:44:53] <holycow> okay, that removes a big piece of the mistery.  inferior-lisp is stdout for slime that makes sense

[14:47:58] <lisp123> holycow: I think of inferior lisp as noting that Emacs has a main Elisp process
[14:48:21] <lisp123> So any other lisp process is 'inferior' to it. Not sure if that's 100% the right way to think about it, but that's how I rationalise it
[14:48:36] <lisp123> Of course, SLIME is 'superior' ;)
[14:49:09] *** Joins: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka)
[14:52:24] <jackdaniel> lisp123: as someone pointed out, the "inferior lisp" is the /common lisp/ process console, slime repl runs for the same process (it connects i.e with the socket)
[14:52:45] <lisp123> yes
[14:53:02] <lisp123> So I view the lisp process of Emacs as the main one, and any other one as the inferior ones
[14:53:09] <jackdaniel> if you had started common lisp in an ordinary console and called (swank::create-server) and then connected from slime to it, then your console would be a counterpart of the inferior lisp compared to cl started from emacs
[14:53:51] <lisp123> I see, does the swank / slime manual refer to the CL process as the inferior one or is it an Emacs term?
[14:55:15] <jackdaniel> I think that I misunderstood what you've asserted; it is emacs term indeed

[16:31:52] <greyrat> I often hear that most of Python's important libraries such as NumPy are written mostly in C. Why is it that other langs such as CL can't easily write their own wrappers and use NumPy then? What makes NumPy so coupled to Python?

[16:36:28] <beach> If a library uses mainly standard C, then it can be used from most Common Lisp implementations.  What makes you think it couldn't?
[16:36:28] <jdz> greyrat: Have you looked at the code?
[16:37:25] <beach> But yeah, I haven't looked at the code either.  If it is written specifically for the purpose of being used from Python, then it may not work.  Not that I know why.
[16:38:54] <jdz> I also have not looked at the code (that's why I'm asking), but I'd bet the code is written specifically as an extension of Python, not a generic number chrunching library with a Python wrapper.
[16:40:09] <beach> Ah, OK.

[16:42:24] <paulapatience> I may be wrong, but I think it provides a uniform interface to various number-crunching libraries written in C (and maybe Fortran and C++ too)

[16:44:21] <semz> Its linear algebra parts are wrappers of BLAS/LAPACK, not sure about the rest.
[16:44:41] <heisig> greyrat: The Python language was designed to allow for a smooth transition between Python code and C code.  Common Lisp wasn't designed that way.
[16:45:35] <heisig> For example, Python guarantees that allocated objects can't be moved in memory, which simplifies FFI a lot.
[16:45:43] *** Parts: pranavats (3fba1d1b34@jabberfr.org) ()
[16:46:12] <heisig> But designing a language that way also has a high price.  Allocations in Python are slow (relative to CL), and multi-threading is extremely limited.
[16:47:02] <heisig> But this also means that a bridge from Common Lisp to NumPy would be quite brittle (or slow).

[17:27:32] <saltrocklamp[m]> i think it's legitimate to want to use an existing gui framework

[17:30:28] <saltrocklamp[m]> it's not portable to other python implementations. instead people are encouraged to use the cffi package, and there is a new work-in-progress c api called "hpy" that is supposed to be an improved c api that alternative implementations of python can support more easily

[17:32:35] <beach> saltrocklamp[m]: I see.  Thanks.
[17:32:45] <edgar-rft> there once was a project on sourceforge.net that tried to generate common lisp wx-widgets ffi-bindings via swig but it never really worked because of the ever-changing wx-widgets api (if I remember right).
[17:33:08] <jcowan> Oh, that's nice.  It means that CPython devs are taking other Pythons seriously, instead of "We are the King, and Our right is divine."
[17:34:21] * edgar-rft is emperor, kings are pedestrian-level
[17:34:32] <saltrocklamp[m]> i can't speak specifically for the cpython core team (i think they are more preoccupied with cpython than they are territorial), but pypy, graalpython, and maybe pyston are all finally reaching the point where they could be legitimate production-grade alternatives, so the community definitely cares about supporting them
[17:34:44] <heisig> beach: I just wanted to point out that calling NumPy from CL is either messy or slow.  I didn't suggest solutions.
[17:35:10] <saltrocklamp[m]> pypy is really a monumental work. imagine sicl, but if common lisp had no formal specification and exactly 1 reference implementation

[17:36:16] <jdz> jackdaniel: gotta keep the discussion on topic!
[17:36:31] <jackdaniel> jcowan: that was a joke. cmucl compiler name is python
[17:36:34] <saltrocklamp[m]> beach heisig: in common lisp specifically, it'd probably make more sense to bind to gsl or something like that. i'm not sure what the story is with sharing vectors w/ external libraries (if there is one at all)
[17:36:45] <jcowan> Oh yes
[17:39:14] <jcowan> Python is now a type B language (one implementation dominant) as opposed to type A (only one implementation exists, dominant by default) and type C (standard is dominant)
[17:39:25] <CodeBitCookie[m]> beach: True and if you remember my rant from yesterday, the only problem is that normies will instantly close an application with those looks (no offense to McCLIM). I love McCLIM.
[17:39:53] <CodeBitCookie[m]> QT has a paid license on non FOSS

[17:43:06] <jcowan> Games are often prized for their unique and offbeat UIs.  If you can make your implementation into a game, that frees you from prior UI expectations.
[17:44:10] <beach> I mean, I agree with jackdaniel that the looks are fine for what I do, and I don't know how to make it look acceptable to the target clientele, but some frame manager with such looks would be very welcome.

[19:50:19] <jcowan> OS development went through two bottlenecks, one for minicomputers aand one for microcomputers.  Unix basically escaped the second one.
[19:51:13] <jcowan> "OS/360 [Windows] development is like moving dead whales along the beach by kicking them."
[19:52:13] <beach> Where is that quote from?
[19:56:47] <jcowan> Unknown.  It has been repeatedly modified by the folk process.  I learned it orally from my first boss.
[19:57:00] <beach> Ah, OK.
[19:57:27] <jcowan> So at this point "Anon." would be a fair attribution, or "Computer folk saying."
[19:59:14] <holycow> beach: giant step backward has been quite the eye opener indeed.  unix was a simplified multix apparently
[20:01:30] <beach> Yes, ("Multics"), highly simplified, given that it had to run on 16-bit processors, whereas Multics was 36 bits.

[21:08:59] <kagevf> beach: I actually did read UHH :) ... definitely an interesting perspective since most of what I hear about Unix/Linux is how it's portrayed as a type of "expert system" (compared to Win and Mac) and to see the POV of how it was a regression compared to what came before ... and even emacs/slime lacks features that earlier Lisp dev environments had ...
[21:09:52] <kagevf> _death: thank you for pointing that out ... I probably wound't had noticed otherwise! (:wild-inferiors)

[21:12:12] <pjb> copec: if you're interested into bbs, and CL, then you'll have much fun implementing one in the other.
[21:12:29] <pjb> copec: note: I have an implementation of the telnet protocol ;-)
[21:16:19] <pjb> well, early unix ran on 18-bit processors; but the simplification wasn't because of the word size, but because of the power of the machine (notably memory-size) and the number of users that could connect simultaneously (basically one or a few on those early PDP-7 or PDP-11 systems).
