[08:04:31] <jmercouris> lagash: yes and no, you can use UIOP and inspect environment variable values
[08:04:43] <jmercouris> You can also use the same opt library we are using
[08:04:59] <jmercouris> That is a little bit of work though
[08:05:12] <jmercouris> That said, that’s not necessary, you can eval any arbitrary code
[08:05:34] <jmercouris> So you can write nyxt —eval “xyz” where xyz is any Lisp code
[08:05:52] <jmercouris> Therefore you can do literally anything you want without “passing an argument” to Nyxt
[08:06:18] <jmercouris> Of course this is not possible in other languages, especially Algol ones, so I can see why this would be non obvious :-)

[16:57:14] <Kabouik> Hey #nyxt. I have upgraded to `master` yesterday and suddenly Nyxt has become unusable on three different machines (two Debian, one Solus). Is there a known issue with recent commits?
[16:58:38] *** Joins: tekakutli (~user@201.141.24.66)
[16:59:07] <Kabouik> I can start Nyxt, it'll offer me to load my history, and then a few seconds later it freezes and I can't do anything with it. If I change workspace (I'm on i3) and go back to the Nyxt workspace, the window does not show up, but it is there, except it borks everything: https://0x0.st/-5Uk.png (my IRC window is not in this workspace, but if I go back to the Nyxt workspace and try to restore the window, it shows this garbled IRC window).
[16:59:36] <Kabouik> Happens on all three machines (the freeze and random window garbling) and two distributions so I assume it may not be a local issue.
[17:01:08] <Kabouik> Or it could be my config. `nyxt -I` seems to prevent the crash. I'll have to investigate errors in terminal when I use my config
[17:01:27] <Kabouik> (My config did not change in two months though, so it's definitely some conflict with a recent commit)
[17:02:11] <Jing_> It also freezed once in my Debian virtual machine yesterday, but I was experimenting so it's possible that some of my behaviors caused that...
[17:02:45] <Kabouik> Hum, no error at all, but it does freeze/crash with the config

[19:44:56] <Kabouik> I don't think I did jmercouris, at least not on the Debian computers that's for sure
[19:45:04] <Kabouik> On the Solus one, I do my updates more regularly
[19:47:49] <Kabouik> I see no update candidate right now in my repo
[19:50:59] <jmercouris> Hm
[19:51:04] <jmercouris> Then we must have broke something
[19:51:15] <jmercouris> :-(
[20:07:34] <Kabouik> Well it is related to my config, but there's no error, and my config was left unchanged the last 2 months so there was some breaking change
[20:08:10] <Kabouik> Which is fine, Nyxt is in development, just it'll be hard to narrow the issue down to one thing if there's no error in terminal

[20:24:20] <jmercouris> I bet it is blocker mode
[20:24:27] <jmercouris> Based on what waleee figured out
[20:30:30] <Kabouik> Heh. Bingo. Thanks jmercouris, waleee!
[20:30:47] <Kabouik> Blocker mode wasn't very effective in my case anyway
[20:31:07] <Kabouik> I guess now that it's disabled I'll see how efficient it was still
[20:32:54] <jmercouris> Lol
[20:32:59] <jmercouris> Well, yea
[20:43:21] <Kabouik> Interestingly, Nyxt now feels faster than it ever was for me. Not quite on par with other browsers yet, but better (I already described that the experience was somewhat frustrating sometimes because of the slowness, which doesn't mean I don't love Nyxt and you all, and the fruit of the day).
[20:43:31] <Kabouik> So perhaps Blocker mode was part of the slowness all along.
[20:48:41] <jmercouris> Hm, perhaps it was
[20:48:51] <jmercouris> Blocker mode is indeed a bottle neck in loading assets
[20:49:02] <jmercouris> We don’t have a fruit yet today Kabouik
[20:49:09] <jmercouris> Would you like to select one?
[20:52:20] <Kabouik> That's a great responsibility, and I must leave in 5 minutes, not sure I want to decide such a critical thing in a hurry
