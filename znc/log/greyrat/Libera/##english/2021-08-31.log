[01:00:48] <mdogg> I infer the verb "sway" to mean moving back and forth without any effort.  But swinging requires work - either someone has to push you so you swing or you do some work yourself so you can swing.
[01:00:59] <mdogg> That's just my opinion though.
[01:01:50] <paulo> .w banana hammock
[01:01:52] <tinsoldier> banana hammock — Noun: 1. (slang) A male thong., 2. (slang) A pair of skimpy swim briefs for men. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/banana_hammock
[01:01:57] <mdogg> A breeze might make someone sway back and forth in a hammock.  But if someone is swinging back and forth, then it (to me) implies that they are shifting their weight so they can move back and forth or someone is pushing them.
[01:05:07] <mdogg> " As verbs the difference between swing and sway is that swing is to move backward and forward, especially rotating about or hanging from a fixed point while sway is to move or swing from side to side; or backward and forward; to rock. "
[01:05:14] <mdogg> https://wikidiff.com/swing/sway
[01:05:55] <mdogg> That's probably a better definition that mine. 
[01:06:07] <CryptoDavid> Oh wow, thanks so much mdogg 
[01:06:09] <CryptoDavid> Makes sense
[01:06:23] <hoglahoo> lol, okay.  paraphrased, then: swing means swing, and sway means swing from side to side
[01:06:55] <paulo> .w cardano
[01:06:56] <mdogg> Right - like you would do on a swing set vs. a hammock.

[01:12:00] <hoglahoo> when you rock a baby to sleep are you swinging it, swaying it, or some combination of both?
[01:12:19] <mdogg> In that example, I would say "rocking it".
[01:12:41] <mdogg> For a hammock I would say swaying.  For a swing set, I would say swinging.
[01:13:13] <mdogg> But you could rock back and forth on a hammock, too.
[01:13:47] <mdogg> I wouldn't say that someone is "rocking back and forth" or "Swaying back and forth" on a swing set, though.

[14:49:03] <tobiasBora> Hello! In a science thesis, I'd like to say something like that: "it can be quite hard to grasp much intuition when using this method", is it correct?
[14:50:01] <darsie> 'grasp intuition' doesn't seem right to me.
[14:50:08] <darsie> hmm
[14:50:09] <darsie> maybe
[14:51:19] <tobiasBora> darsie: do you have a better formulation by any chance?
[14:51:40] <darsie> Perhaps with more context.
[14:51:54] * darsie is a German native speaker.
[14:53:27] <tobiasBora> Well basically I have a method A to do something, but the method is basically "do heavy maths without understanding", and I'd like to say that this method does not help when wanting to obtain a better intuition on the issue.
[14:53:52] *** Joins: StayHungry (~StayHungr@gateway/tor-sasl/stayhungry)
[14:55:16] <darsie> How about 'get/build much intuition'?
[14:55:27] <darsie> or gain
[14:56:14] <darsie> grasp means understand, I think.
[14:56:16] <darsie> .grasp
[14:56:24] <darsie> .w grasp
[14:56:26] <tinsoldier> grasp — Noun: 1. (sometimes figuratively) Grip.Understanding., 2. That which is accessible; that which is within one's reach or ability., — Verb: 1. To grip; to take hold, particularly with the hand.To understand., 2. To take advantage of something, to seize, to jump at a chance. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grasp
[14:59:47] <tobiasBora> I was using grasp like "to take", like a visual way to "take the intuition".
[14:59:57] <tobiasBora> but gain is cool as well
[15:00:11] <StayHungry> darsie: what's the original question, genosse?
[15:00:20] <twb> tobiasBora: darsie's suggestion, "grasp", is sensible
[15:00:31] <tobiasBora> "hard to gain much intuition" would be better than "hard to grasp much intuition"
[15:00:56] <tobiasBora> twb: ok thanks!
[15:01:01] <tobiasBora> darsie: thanks a lot

[17:53:39] <Syzygy> the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) for scientific papers.

[21:42:26] <blkshp> pufferfish: you need to register your nick to be seen
[21:43:07] <AmalLight> ah ah this video is funny
[21:43:57] <blkshp> pufferfish: temporary change due to some ongoing issues
[21:49:28] <pussipupu> If you could set one of the boys bots to explain that it might help when ops aren't available
[21:49:38] <pussipupu> just a thought
[21:50:35] <blkshp> I have considered it but pufferfish is the first in 3 days that's not been the one that's spamming but I think it's been reduced due to the fact he's screaming into the wind and no one knows it.

[21:53:08] <pufferfish> it's alright though. i answered AmalLight in private.
[21:54:18] * CuriosTiger wanders in.
[21:54:30] <blkshp> I don't want anyone to leave, but I also don't see why you won't register. I will leave it alone if you don't wish to discuss it, I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable but there may be a reason that isn't actually a thing :)

[21:56:19] <blkshp> lovely.
[21:56:39] <blkshp> If you keep the same nick, you'll get autovoice
[21:56:49] <bin> wow I feel hurt by this development.
[21:57:07] <blkshp> Why?
[21:57:24] <bin> I don't really, I was just kidding because I don't get autovoice
[21:57:36] <huf> use your imagination
[21:57:36] <blkshp> well you have an account :P
[21:57:41] <CuriosTiger> Hi blinkshop.
[21:57:50] <bin> I know, I was just being a bit cheeky :P
[21:57:58] <huf> /nick crstgr nao
[21:58:16] <pufferfish> hey, i didn't ask for a voice. ##English is one of the few channels which didn't require a registration upfront so i would wander here every once in a while i'm on IRC. i like to answer the English grammar questions. i didn't know you insituted a policy of registrations due to spam, etc.
[21:58:20] <CuriosTiger> I would, but I don't want to have to rely on manual voicing. :)
[21:58:20] <huf> shit, hf is already taken
[21:58:55] <bin> pufferfish: oh I know I was just kidding around :P
[21:58:59] <huf> N VWL NCK DY!
[21:59:11] <blkshp> Temporary as I said. Voice in this instance is being used for it's purpose not an affectation.

[21:59:41] <CuriosTiger> This meeting I'm in is so incredibly boring.
