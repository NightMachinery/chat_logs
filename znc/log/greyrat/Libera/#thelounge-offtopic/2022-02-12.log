[04:13:26] <johncs> So I now have a Bash automatic-code-formatter, linter, and profiler. I feel like I want to make some production webapp with bash now.

[04:38:42] <xnaas> oh no
[04:39:05] <xnaas> I use https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/ every day for my shitty excuse for Python code :D
[04:42:47] <xnaas> > Didn't test it myself but took a close look at the code and feel reasonably confident this'll do what's advertised.
[04:42:47] <xnaas> I blindly trust all my code all the time, johncs. ðŸ˜Ž
[04:42:55] <xnaas> in prod, too, of course
[04:43:00] <xnaas> go prod or go home
[04:44:34] <johncs> ðŸ˜† haha since you have those screenshots so i'm under the impression you've tested this. doesn't seem like a scary enough change to warrant a bunch of poking.
[04:44:50] * xnaas is really a QA guy on the inside
[04:45:23] <johncs> I don't have the patience for hardcore QA ðŸ˜…
[04:45:32] <johncs> I've worked at some places with _a lot_ of manual testing
[04:45:37] <johncs> I couldn't do it
[04:45:53] <xnaas> I mean, I somehow found it #4429 like wtf
[04:45:56] <xnaas> s/it/out
[04:46:10] <johncs> Worked on software for set top boxes for awhile. The number of QA folks they had just going through endless lists of manual tests was wild.
[04:46:20] <xnaas> who sits there and manually tests .ogg containers with different codecs inside?!
[04:46:21] <xnaas> :P
[04:46:49] <xnaas> I like finding janky/obscure shit, mostly
[04:47:10] <xnaas> Slide for Reddit on Android, many years ago, would break if you plugged in a type-c to ethernet adapter
[04:47:12] <xnaas> lol
[04:47:22] <xnaas> dev was like "bro how do you find this out"
[04:47:49] <johncs> haha i wish i had more users like you using shmeppy
[04:48:06] <johncs> users will see something very obviously broken and just go "eh, it's fine, i'll just never mention this to anyone"
[04:48:28] <xnaas> :D
[04:49:29] <xnaas> I'm that way about some things, I suppose. I also don't blame people. They're used to stuff from very large companies being broken and any cries you send out fall on very deaf ears.
[04:50:08] <xnaas> speaking of deaf ears
[04:50:16] <xnaas> I know the Apple hate is strong
[04:50:31] <xnaas> but I just bought some airpod pros to use as discount hearing aids
[04:50:32] <xnaas> and wow
[04:50:39] <xnaas> it's so, so weird hearing people talk to me again
[04:50:42] <xnaas> and I'm not yelling any more
[04:50:59] <xnaas> I didn't realize, I guess, how truly deaf I'd gotten ðŸ˜…
[04:53:18] <xnaas> So...my plans for leaving iOS are probably dead now ðŸ˜…
[04:53:23] <xnaas> hearing OP
[04:53:49] <xnaas> and thanks for mentioning shmeppy; bookmark'd and maybe it'll be useful at some point in my life :D
[04:55:24] <johncs> I'm glad they're working well :)
[04:56:17] <johncs> and totes, hope it is. There's a bunch of virtual tabletops out there now... it's wild.
[04:56:25] <xnaas> I definitely still have a lot of fine-tuning to do and I think getting another real audiogram (used a random app and it helped some) to feed into my health data well help even more.
[04:56:39] <xnaas> yeah; definitely a full market now haha
[04:58:15] <johncs> no one told me everyone and their mother was going to become my competitor ðŸ˜­. all well, i feel like I'm doing ok carving out a cozy niche
[04:58:58] <xnaas> I'm sure you don't want to discuss it too much, but good number of DMs paying that $5/mo?
[04:59:18] <xnaas> (feel free to ignore the question altogether, of course)
[04:59:51] <johncs> ah I'm happy to, i don't keep much close to my chest. the only thing I'm a bit secretive bout is my algorithm for detecting grids in an image, because afaict it's actually novel and none of my competitors have figured it out
[04:59:57] <johncs> I've got 700 subscribers right now
[05:00:04] <xnaas> not bad!
[05:00:34] <xnaas> All the problems of "the web" aside, I think it's cool that some random dude can make a tool people find useful and make some decent money off it.
[05:00:37] <johncs> indeed :). i've got investments as well and i do contract work every once in awhile. it's enough to get by at the moment. hoping for more eventually
[05:00:45] <johncs> but i'm very proud
[05:00:48] <johncs> it is :)
