[05:01:23] <MootPoot> when I was a wee lad
[05:01:46] <ButterNoodle> I mean the west and south end is pretty rough.. not chicago rough...

[06:40:02] <isekaijin> JesseDesu: Alpine Linux is not the kind of distro you would use for normal stuff. It is for systems that need to be extremely minimal.
[06:40:21] <JesseDesu> like a nas?
[06:40:25] <JesseDesu> or router
[06:40:26] <ButterNoodle> or a router
[06:40:31] <JesseDesu> jinkx
[06:40:35] <ButterNoodle> :)
[06:40:55] <JesseDesu> i dunno why you cant just use a dedicated router hardware
[06:41:01] <ButterNoodle> you can
[06:41:08] <JesseDesu> with openwrt
[06:41:24] <ButterNoodle> actually mikrotik just released their hap ac3
[06:41:29] <ButterNoodle> that thing is sweet
[06:41:33] <JesseDesu> setting up a router is hard
[06:41:40] <JesseDesu> i dont understand what port forwarding is
[06:41:45] <JesseDesu> or why i'd need a firewall
[06:41:52] <isekaijin> rofl
[06:41:59] <JesseDesu> seriouslly
[06:42:08] <JesseDesu> i dont give 2 fucks what they are actually

[06:42:20] <JesseDesu> haha dont
[06:42:33] <JesseDesu> i'm a plug and play user
[06:42:54] <isekaijin> Setting up a router is not hard. What is hard to deal with is the fact that these days ISPs do not let you use your own router, but force you to use theirs, which they control.
[06:43:10] <JesseDesu> my internet provider gave me a choice
[06:43:12] <ButterNoodle> isekaijin: I've never had that problem
[06:43:17] <JesseDesu> i used theirs

[09:39:33] <ImoutoBot> blue_rog: amigojapan was last seen in ##anime 13 hours and 56 minutes ago: <amigojapan> Ok bye
[09:39:47] <MootPoot> My next phone I'm going to fast charge the fuck out of 
[09:40:01] <blue_rog> what phone do you have
[09:40:11] <MootPoot> But I'll only buy the phones where I can pre buy replacement batteries 
[09:40:19] <MootPoot> blue_rog: I'm running a lg v60
[09:40:24] <blue_rog> don
[09:40:38] <blue_rog> don't most modern phones not let you replace batteries
[09:41:07] <blue_rog> how is your LG? I had a LG in the past and man it was really bad imo
[09:41:13] <MootPoot> They let you 
[09:41:19] <MootPoot> But it's a PITA to do 
[09:41:21] <MootPoot> But it's possible
[09:41:36] <MootPoot> blue_rog: it really depends on which LG you're talking about 
[09:41:49] <blue_rog> > ... PITA ... yeah, then that makes sense
[09:41:56] <MootPoot> The g4 was shit, but the G2,g3 and g5 were good 
[09:42:04] <MootPoot> Same with the V series 
[09:42:10] <MootPoot> The 808 chip was garbage 
[09:42:13] <blue_rog> I don't remember my model name, but it was the 2014-15 era
[09:42:24] <MootPoot> This v60 is pretty good tbh , I have no complaints 
[09:42:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most modern phones are garbage not intended to be repaired or maintained at all.
[09:42:48] <blue_rog> it was so slow after a half year and like even though i tried to keep it clean (software wise) it still became slow
[09:42:53] <MootPoot> To a degree....they still offer manufacturer repair services 
[09:43:19] <MootPoot> And the design is still somewhat modular , at least once you get it open 
[09:43:21] <blue_rog> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah that's the issue. I really like the private people who repair things cause they know what they're doing
[09:43:32] <MootPoot> But it's shit compared to what it used to be 
[09:43:45] <MootPoot> The galaxy s5 was really something
[09:43:57] <MootPoot> Repair and replace it all with just one screwdriver
[09:44:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Shit should be like the fairphone and framework laptop
[09:44:10] <MootPoot> blue_rog: sounds like a g4 lul
[09:44:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Fully disassembleable and replaceable.
[09:44:28] <MootPoot> I still don't have faith in them 
[09:44:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You literally swap-out the CPU/BIOS board for upgrading and keep the rest.
[09:44:41] <blue_rog> is fairphone the one Linus Tech Tips recently reviewd?
[09:44:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: No idea.
[09:44:51] <blue_rog> MootPoot: is g4 a good thing or a bad thing
[09:44:57] <blue_rog> brb lemme check LTT's videos
[09:45:03] <MootPoot> A lot of these ideas come and go, it needs staying power for me to care about fairpjone
[09:45:14] <MootPoot> blue_rog: g4 was shit , 808 chip had so many issues 
[09:46:09] <blue_rog> Aurora_v_kosmose: it is apparently called the framework laptop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rkTgPt3M4k
[09:46:10] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] A COMPLETELY Upgradeable Laptop?  - Framework Laptop Review | Duration: 18 minutes, 46 seconds
[09:46:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yup. That's the one.
[09:46:37] <blue_rog> MootPoot: ah rip that makes sense. I bought a One Plus 5 in 2017 and man, it still runs like day 1
[09:46:53] <MootPoot> I'd be more open about the fairphone etc if they shipped a replacement display and battery within the price with the device 
[09:46:54] <blue_rog> I haven't changed my phone for 3.75 years and runs so good
[09:47:07] <MootPoot> I know I can just get it seperately 
[09:47:07] <blue_rog> MootPoot: would you be willing to pay for that, though?
[09:47:20] <MootPoot> blue_rog: shouldn't be too expensive on top 
[09:47:28] <MootPoot> Maybe an extra 50 dollars 
[09:47:35] <blue_rog> only???
[09:47:37] <blue_rog> wow
[09:47:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (I like the thick usable-as-a-club-in-a-jiffy kind laptops though...)
[09:47:43] <MootPoot> The main cost is the overhead of delivering the object 
[09:47:46] <blue_rog> that's actualyl cheap-ish
[09:47:53] <MootPoot> Packaging extra shit with it is ez
[09:48:09] <MootPoot> Most things you buy in NA are like 2x their factory cost 
[09:48:23] <MootPoot> Since it's just shipping and support and branding and boxing and marketing etc
[09:48:55] <blue_rog> I need to  buy a new phone actually
[09:49:01] <MootPoot> I wouldn't be surprised if a out of factory battery would be like 10 or 13 bucks, and a extra display maybe 30 on top
[09:49:21] <blue_rog> I really want a new One Plus, but i'm concerned about 'china' and stuff
[09:49:50] <blue_rog> one plus man... i haven't seen such good phones like that before
[09:50:12] <blue_rog> like even my mom's phone which always slowed down cause of the extra random bloat she'd download - it's still surprisingly good.
[09:50:46] <blue_rog> but like i said, i'm still a bit paranoid about the 'china' stuff as of late 
[09:51:40] <MootPoot> Imo it's pointless to be paranoid unless it's your work phone 
[09:51:53] <MootPoot> Linked up to company stuff you might be legally liable for 
[09:52:04] <MootPoot> blue_rog: every retail smartphone is compromised
[09:52:19] <MootPoot> Just decide who you want to give your data too
[09:52:35] <MootPoot> I'll prefer china, since at least they can't act on it when I'm living here 
[09:52:39] <blue_rog> Like, I'm actually considering getting a pixel to try calyxos (https://calyxos.org/)

[09:58:57] <blue_rog> cause of that
[09:59:37] <MootPoot> Eh
[09:59:42] <MootPoot> Too expensive
[10:00:01] <MootPoot> Tbh I'm having a really hard time seeing the value of a higher end device these days 
[10:00:24] <MootPoot> I don't think I'll bother spending more then 500usd on my next phone,and even that's a bit overboard
[10:01:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Pinephone.
[10:01:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also Librem.
[10:01:30] <ButterNoodle> cock phone
[10:01:35] <ButterNoodle> u know
[10:01:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And I guess fairphone as well, if they also separated the baseband from the CPU like the other two
[10:01:55] <ButterNoodle> all ur data is compromised as soon as it hits the carrier network
[10:02:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Nope.
[10:02:08] <blue_rog> doesn't pine phone run some linux distro
[10:02:08] <ButterNoodle> lol yes
[10:02:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Only plaintext data is.
[10:02:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And only data transmited over it.
[10:02:21] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: eh, I can get better for the same money then a pinephone
[10:02:32] <ButterNoodle> you think that certificate ur getting is really from the site ur going to?
[10:02:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unlike phones where the baseband is integrated inside the CPU and has full access ot the whole memoryspace
[10:02:42] <MootPoot> I'm not stressed about repair on a mid or low end device 
[10:02:45] <blue_rog> looks like it runs manjaro, hmm
[10:03:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Chummer, what makes you think I'm not using my own PKI or going on darknet nodes I know?
[10:03:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or using paired keys I setup ahead of time?
[10:03:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So basically, bugger off with that defeatism.
[10:03:41] <ButterNoodle> if ur a darknetter only or using ur own CA.. obv they cant get those
[10:04:06] <ButterNoodle> even tor packets can be reassembled after the fact
[10:04:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They can only get what is plaintext or already compromised.
[10:04:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Not really. The netflow can be. The data is still a no.
[10:04:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So the anonymization breaks because Tor has shit-tier resilience to global observers and timing analysis, but the crypto is still sound.
[10:05:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> By the way, sale of netflow data means basically any corp can now be a global observer.
[10:05:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (yes this sucks)
[10:05:14] <ButterNoodle> yes
[10:05:20] <ButterNoodle> and its not netflow
[10:05:23] <blue_rog> with tor, you can fingerprint traffic to _probably_ figure out which website the target is visiting, but even that's hard
[10:05:24] <ButterNoodle> actual packets
[10:05:29] <ButterNoodle> netflow is for chumps
[10:05:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: Not anymore sadly.
[10:06:02] <blue_rog> yeah, with the protections of today, it's really hard
[10:06:06] <blue_rog> but like
[10:06:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Why the hell would they bother with that since they can't decrypt it until modern crypto gets broken?
[10:06:10] <blue_rog> theoretically, s ure
[10:06:43] <ButterNoodle> you dont think you can reassemble a tcp stream of encrypted packets?
[10:06:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: Ah, nvm, I misread what you meant.
[10:06:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: I'm saying they can't decipher it, which is what matters.
[10:06:59] <ButterNoodle> not really
[10:07:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In any case, at this point Tor's usefulness as anything but a proxy other irc users can't trivially backtrace is dubious.

[10:08:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I2P fares slightly better, but since it's also being used mostly for it's TCP-emulation with tight message timing, it's also vulnerable to timing analysis of the same sort.
[10:08:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically, low-delay networks are doomed/dead.
[10:09:19] <blue_rog> whenever you have anything related to timing, the solution is to have somesort of regular timing intervals between the packets. although this does put a strain on the routers, it's incredibly effective for obvious reasons
[10:09:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: Unfortunately, TCP and programs that think they're using it have some fairly tight expectations for timing intervals.
[10:10:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Far too much so.

[10:10:56] <amigojapan> blue_rog: just was watching reality TV from America with tomako
[10:10:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Imagine something like an NNTP index you get a list of articles or whatever, and you send out messaging you want them, leave the program to run and come back to it later while doing other stuff in the meantime. 
[10:10:57] <blue_rog> I can't think of a way that'll happen without reworking the fundamentals of most low-level protocols, at least tcp Aurora_v_kosmose

[10:11:07] <blue_rog> what show amigojapan?
[10:11:08] <ImoutoBot> [video/mp4] 5.4MB
[10:11:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: Easy-enough, simply make the link-level information mostly useless by sufficient rerouting, mixing and delays.
[10:11:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: Application-level addressing and messaging is what matters.
[10:11:45] <blue_rog> you say simple, but that requires significant work
[10:12:03] <blue_rog> as does anything that requires rework
[10:12:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Rerouting and mixing are already part of I2P.
[10:12:08] <amigojapan> blue_rog: ummm I would need to search the name again. But it was about single fathers looking for a wife
[10:12:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Delays aren't implemented. Messages are also part of the supported API
[10:12:24] <blue_rog> oh, sounds like many shows amigojapan, was it good though?
[10:12:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: GNUnet also supports all these things, though I'm not sure if delays are implemented there either.
[10:12:57] <amigojapan> blue_rog: well all of them seemed to end up breaking up
[10:13:38] <amigojapan> blue_rog: tomako was reading the subtitles
[10:14:11] <blue_rog> yeah but like, for you to work at the link level, it would probably be better for you to work on core network routers to work with this new 'model' instead of trying to 'monkey-patch' it thorugh applications. Is that what you meant? Aurora_v_kosmose?
[10:14:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: By the way, I looked further into it, USB storage devices basically all use SCSI (or SCSI->ATA translation) of some sort https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI_/_ATA_Translation
[10:14:16] <ImoutoBot> [title] SCSI / ATA Translation - Wikipedia
[10:14:51] <blue_rog> amigojapan: they all broke up? nope, then i am not going to watch that. that'll just break me
[10:14:55] <amigojapan> Thanks for looking out up Aurora_v_kosmose 
[10:15:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: Not really, the link level isn't every meaningful. It's merely hops and nodes in the network with no indication of being source or destination.
[10:15:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You could also send it over packet radio or carrier pidgeon if you wanted.
[10:15:19] <amigojapan> blue_rog: yeah and it was like 6 couples
[10:15:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Especially since messages are considered distinct whole units
[10:16:31] <blue_rog> so lemme see if i get this straight: is it that you're going to get end users / nodes that are exchanging network packets to add a certain delay / randomize the timings from their end Aurora_v_kosmose ?
[10:17:11] <blue_rog> because then the issue with that is buffer build up, however small your delay is
[10:17:52] <amigojapan> blue_rog: tomako recommends watching another reality TV she searched up as "randy wedding dress" it is about women picking wedding dresses
[10:19:39] <blue_rog> there's also the issue of (assuming i understood it correct) that servers need to implement it too. the issue with timing attacks is that it could be two ways, even if the user adds delays. the server could send packets at certain intervals and that still could be correlated with a legend of website patterns
[10:19:53] <blue_rog> amigojapan: i will give that a shot
[10:20:02] <ButterNoodle> tcp has a simple fix already built in.. its called sequence numbers

[10:20:41] <blue_rog> what is this a fix for, though? are you talking about timing?
[10:20:44] *** Joins: jusski (~user@88.118.99.255)
[10:21:02] <ButterNoodle> timing, speed, sequence.. whatever
[10:21:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: They'll decide random delays before passing messages along, caching them locally in the meantime.
[10:21:22] <blue_rog> timing isn't necessarily solved by seq numbers though
[10:21:29] <ButterNoodle> how so
[10:21:45] <ButterNoodle> define "timing"
[10:22:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: You could designate a space inside a ramdisk to not destroy your drives too fast and that would simply limit how much bandwidth you get based on the messages you can forward & receive within that limited amount of space.
[10:22:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you're using it on a 1TB ram machine... you probably can ignore that concern altogether.
[10:22:33] <blue_rog> my talk about timing (because i did a bit of work on this at a Uni in the US) is about inter-packet timing ButterNoodle. i.e. the timing between packets sent out and received from the router to your computer
[10:23:00] <JesseDesu> what is genshin impact about
[10:23:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: The model I'm suggesting cannot work with websites as they are right now.
[10:23:13] <ButterNoodle> yea they are just queued and sent
[10:23:19] <blue_rog> Yeah Aurora_v_kosmose, that sounds good for end-users. not so great for servers that deal with numerous connections
[10:23:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: It'd be more "I want to queue this up for later reading, send this to me" and then you come back or get a notification at some point you received all parts.
[10:23:40] <blue_rog> and that still leaves it susceptible to fingerprinting attacks (essentially timing attacks)
[10:24:09] <JesseDesu> finger attacks
[10:24:15] <blue_rog> lewd

[10:24:18] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: (159 / 463) <B​utterNoodle> b​eaky everyone should have a cute cousin to fingerbang for childhood memories (1 more)
[10:24:23] <JesseDesu> !more
[10:24:23] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: (174 / 463) <B​utterNoodle> I look back on my 15 yo self and think that I shouldnt have fingerbanged my cousin on the bus… <B​utterNoodle> I should have banged her…
[10:24:46] <ButterNoodle> yea finger attacks are happening on the session tho
[10:24:56] <blue_rog> Aurora_v_kosmose: is what you said something that I2P network uses? in which case i'll read up about it
[10:25:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: There are ways to penalize nodes that answer too fast or try to fingerprint others by sending messages without delays, whether those delays are chosen by the query user in an encrypted request, or made up by the server.
[10:25:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: Not yet.
[10:25:08] <JesseDesu> i opened a port on ufw
[10:25:09] <ButterNoodle> has nothing to do with the lower level protocols other than resource drain
[10:25:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> blue_rog: The message infrastructure is there. The delay mechanisms I'm talking about are mostly in the whitepaper & experimental implementation in a variety of networks phase.
[10:25:37] <JesseDesu> i'm behind a nat i think
[10:25:41] <JesseDesu> so i think i'm safe
[10:25:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: If nothing listen to that port, even if you expose it to the internet raw, nothing happens.
[10:25:57] <MootPoot> its midnight
[10:25:58] <MootPoot> bedtime
[10:26:02] <blue_rog> are there any whitepapers / research papers which explain what you're saying? because in my mind, not without a major reform is that possible. a whitepaper link would be helpful for me to go through Aurora_v_kosmose

[10:51:12] <JesseDesu> no i will watch the anime

[10:56:12] <emmeka> it also has some magical realism weirdness which doesn't make a lot of sense in the anime because it never gets to parts where it matters, so, when the alien girl shows up, don't think too much of it

[11:04:14] <Neopolitan> that sounds like a you problem ButterNoodle

[11:05:14] <ButterNoodle> yea u dont understand physics.. you have to fap "in" them to get the pages to stick together

[16:28:25] <DunceCotus> what's with this 'tribal' trend in pop culture
[16:28:34] <DunceCotus> like everyone getting a bunch of tattoos
[16:28:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have no tattoos
[16:29:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: me neither
[16:29:30] <amigojapan> I will never get a tattoo
[16:29:48] <DunceCotus> I've struggled with scarring all my adolescence and beyond.. I fail to see the appeal of deliberate scarification

[16:31:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: people should accept you for who you are
[16:31:52] <DunceCotus> like I don't mind a tattoo here or there
[16:32:07] <DunceCotus> but like an entire arm or neck or even face covered with tattoos? Ew
[16:32:39] <amigojapan> Defiling the human body
[16:32:51] <DunceCotus> its like they have accepted the 'no-future' situation and don't anticipate having to live beyond their 40s
[16:33:13] <DunceCotus> quite sad really
[16:33:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: ButterNoodle wants to remove his tattoos now
[16:33:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its not even that, its just nihilism
[16:34:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I see... yeah g'luck with that
[16:34:17] <amigojapan> Yup
[16:34:25] <DunceCotus> we don't really have any cure for scars

[16:35:10] <DunceCotus> yeah but I can't imagine its all that successful
[16:35:21] <amigojapan> No idea
[16:35:21] <DunceCotus> they would be able to remove the ink some, but the scar would remain
[16:35:33] <amigojapan> I see
[16:36:33] <JesseDesu> i wanted to get a tattoo of some french words in college
[16:36:51] <JesseDesu> i factored in tattoo regret ahead of time
[16:37:35] <amigojapan> My dad said he always wanted to get a tattoo. But my grandmother did not want him to
[16:39:06] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there are temporary tattoos too. If you ever want something that won't hurt you
[16:39:40] <DunceCotus> temporary tattoos rub off too easily
[16:39:50] <amigojapan> Ok

[16:49:53] <amigojapan> Really theholyduck 
[16:49:56] <theholyduck> amigojapan: like how much of an inner monologue you have depends on the person
[16:50:10] <theholyduck> some people dont have one at all. some people only have one  in very specific circumstances
[16:50:11] <amigojapan> I see
[16:50:13] <theholyduck> some people always have it
[16:50:32] <DunceCotus> I find if I think with monologue its like I'm still talking but very silently
[16:50:33] <amigojapan> I always have it going on
[16:50:51] <amigojapan> I also hear the words I read
[16:51:26] <theholyduck> like i only have a inner monologue when im writing
[16:51:38] <theholyduck> otherwise its basicly entirely silent up there
[16:51:49] <amigojapan> Nice
[16:52:27] <theholyduck> but theres a whole spectrum of things like that
[16:54:26] <amigojapan> theholyduck: it would be nice to relax from the inner dialogue more often. I think it only relaxes in deep sleep
[16:55:16] <theholyduck> i think in images and feelings mostly. so when im trying to sleep and its r acing i put on an audiobook
[16:55:27] <theholyduck> forces my brain over to processing auditory signals 
[16:55:49] <amigojapan> I see
[16:55:56] <theholyduck> and like my brain quiets down when im trying to sleep
[16:56:05] <theholyduck> if theres audio i can listen to
[16:56:17] <theholyduck> but i think the listening to an audiobook to fall asleep works for a lot of people who have intrusive thoughts when sleeping
[16:56:38] <amigojapan> Ok
[16:56:42] <theholyduck> ive been using the same audiobook for like a year now :D
[16:56:58] <DunceCotus> I tend to talk to myself with my thoughts
[16:57:01] <theholyduck> i set up a 30 minute sleep out function on it every time i go to bed
[16:57:05] <DunceCotus> but otherwise its images and feelz
[16:57:23] <theholyduck> and im never awake for when it cuts out
[16:57:38] <amigojapan> I keep on having a monologue about how to solve my problems
[16:57:54] <theholyduck> and im somebody who used to have a LOT of trouble falling asleep before the audiobook trick
[16:58:06] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: hmm ok
[16:58:22] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: reading helps me fall asleep
[16:58:33] <theholyduck> too intense for my brain 
[16:58:38] <theholyduck> i can spend all night reading no problem
[16:58:56] <theholyduck> i listen to a dry techincal audiobook i have listened to before
[16:59:02] <DunceCotus> I get quickly bored unless its a great yarn
[16:59:35] <DunceCotus> audiobooks would keep me awake I feel
[16:59:52] <DunceCotus> people talking in my ears.. I'd prefer not to
[17:00:04] <DunceCotus> when trying to sleep anyway
[17:00:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: do you 'hear' the monologue in your head?
[17:00:54] <amigojapan> I have tried asrm while sleeping, but it resulted in nightmares

[22:56:36] <vegii> I just wanna hear "you rent a VPS, put apache on it and set up letsencrypt"
[22:57:08] <Bco1981> was thinking it, but wasn't sure you were the DIY person for that.
[22:58:21] <vegii> I mean, if you've got a cheaper option... I guess gitlab pages is the other option but I'm confused as to how letsencrypt cert renewal would be supposed to work there
