[00:00:01] <daemon> it would have to deal with that
[00:00:18] <daemon> oh for the rapid response cleaning
[00:00:23] <daemon> that would be quite the technical challenge
[00:00:38] <daemon> your friends could be around or anything
[00:00:46] <daemon> lots of variables and possible events
[00:01:30] <simcop2387> it's easier to let the human decide and just have a voice assistant connected (Alexa, Google Home, Apple NSA, or one of the open source ones, Almond, Rhasspy, Mycroft, etc.)
[00:01:33] *** Joins: kitsunenokenja (~kitsunech@68.91.220.96)
[00:01:42] <simcop2387> then you just yell, "hey dumbass, clean the living room"
[00:01:54] <daemon> I had no idea there even was any opensource ones, really quite cool
[00:03:26] <simcop2387> that's the next thing i'm going to try to set up.  mycroft and rhasspy look to be the most complete ones but they're both difficult to setup.  i'm using my second server as the host for doing all the heavy lifting (home assistant is on a separate raspberry pi, since it also does all my lights i want it to function completely separately)
[00:03:52] <daemon> I would assume with voice assistants the big thing is how well they understand you
[00:03:59] <daemon> cause surely the rest is just trigger words and phrases
[00:04:41] <simcop2387> the two big halfs are the listening (audio side to text/meaning) and the understanding (NLP to skills/actions/whatever)
[00:05:10] <daemon> I do not think I could resist the temptations of giving everything a code and shouting comand star trek style
[00:05:12] <simcop2387> the last little bit is integration with services, which none of them have except the three big NSA sponsored ones (Apple, Google, Amazon)
[00:05:16] <daemon> which makes it easier on the voice assistant lol

[00:06:00] <simcop2387> i have done that already

[00:07:13] <simcop2387> it's the typically bad CRI that the RGB part of bulbs have, you get a really narrow red that doesn't match brightness with what the white light tells your brain

[05:41:26] <gordonfish> aquanight: say/print won't have an ordinary prototype since they take that optional handle in the first position, lacking a following comma, which can't be replicated with normal subs.
[05:41:44] <aquanight> yeah
[05:42:04] <aquanight> I was hoping to just make a say STDERR "${prefix}" helper
[05:42:18] <aquanight> and I was going to be too clever and figure out how to parameterize the filehandle so it was a real say-like
[05:42:21] <gordonfish> Similar with map and grep, which have the EXPR/BLOCK split identity.
[05:42:27] <aquanight> but I ended up doing something different altogether
[05:43:06] <aquanight> and yes I say that despite now realizing that I only really needed it for STDERR so why tf did I want to parameterize it
[05:43:23] <gordonfish> sub errhelper { say STDERR @_; }
[05:43:33] <aquanight> but it doesn't matter because I had to refactor the underlying algorithm to where having a ${prefix} at all was unfeasible
[05:43:51] <aquanight> it was originally recursive
[05:43:56] <aquanight> and that was fine for the test cases
[05:44:06] <aquanight> then the real thing came along and fell over dead on my fatalized deep recursion warnings

[11:36:39] <Mandevil> Easy things are hard, hard things are impossible?
[11:37:26] <xq> sounds like C++!
[11:38:51] <Sophira> Hi. I have a weird issue. I have a regex that seems to be matching when I don't expect it to. See this paste:
[11:38:58] <Sophira> https://l.perl.bot/p/d7jef9
[11:38:58] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Perlbot Pastebin ]
[11:39:28] <lopid> try \@$
[11:39:46] <Sophira> That does work, and I already worked around that, but I'm confused why that's matching in the first place.
[11:40:05] <lopid> it tries to expand to the @$ array
[11:40:16] <lopid> @ being the sigil for arrays
[11:40:21] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@d4yfc6hcw3j76jt6w-4-4.rev.dnainternet.fi) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[11:40:46] <lopid> the same would happen with $ if it wasn't at the end
[11:41:14] *** Joins: haj1 (~haj@ip5f5bf913.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[11:41:36] <Sophira> Right, but @$ isn't a Perl array according to "perldoc perlvar", and it's not defined otherwise, so I'd think it would be caught with "use strict". Am I wrong?
[11:41:56] <lopid> apparently
[11:41:58] <xq> regexps interpolate like double quotes
[11:42:13] <lopid> @foo isn't a perl array either, but it would try to expand it
[11:42:20] <xq> sweval: my $str = "@$"; [$str]
[11:42:21] <perlbot> xq: [""]

[12:47:25] <Sophira> So it turns out bisecting between 5.8.8 and 5.34.0 is fraught. I was able to work around the <command-line> issue in makefile ( https://groups.google.com/g/perl.perl5.porters/c/heXAg5y4xaQ?pli=1 ) but I keep getting segfaults in the commits I'm trying to build. I was able to build both 5.8.8 and 5.34.0 fine, but for some reason I've been unable to compile many of the commits in between, no matter how many 
[12:47:26] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ make: *** No rule to make target `<command-line>', needed by `miniperlmain.o'. ]
[12:47:31] <Sophira> commits I skipped over. I'm clearly doing something wrong.
[12:48:26] <xq> it broke somewhere between 5.24 and 5.26
[12:48:51] <xq> quite possibly in the first release of 5.26
[12:49:34] <Sophira> Ah, okay.
[12:49:50] <Sophira> So not a problem with my setup then?
[12:50:05] <xq> no
[12:50:19] <xq> it might be worth reporting though
[12:51:22] <Sophira> What could be done about it, though? You wouldn't be able to fix it in the git repo without requiring everyone to force pull.
[12:51:36] <xq> Sophira: I meant the @$ not the building/bisecting part
[12:52:08] <Sophira> Oh, okay.
[12:52:21] <Sophira> Thank you.
[12:57:22] <Sophira> Okay, I seem to be having better luck when using an earlier GCC version.
[12:57:37] <Sophira> I guess earlier Perls can't be built with GCC 10.

[13:00:28] <Sophira> I already tested 5.26.0, it doesn't warn there.
[13:00:37] <Sophira> I'm bisecting between 5.24.0 and 5.26.0 now.
[13:00:58] <Sophira> Should be okay now that I'm using a good GCC (8.4.0)

[21:29:40] <vms14> do you currently use xml in your applications?
[21:29:58] <vms14> I know json is better, but just for web related stuff
[21:30:53] <vms14> xml gives you more freedom than json and perl seems to have a very strong (and old) relationship with xml
[21:31:09] <Grinnz> no, always json
[21:31:30] <Grinnz> xml's structure doesn't map to data structures easily

[21:32:14] <vms14> hah rindolf 
[21:32:23] <vms14> if you knew why I want xml
[21:33:02] <Grinnz> xml is for substring textual markup, which html is more useful for
[21:33:08] <vms14> it happens that xml is the best representation of a list that perl can have
[21:33:16] <Grinnz> ?
[21:33:21] <vms14> it's a language for creating lists
[21:33:21] <Grinnz> arrays?
[21:33:51] *** Parts: art1 (~romeyke@p200300ccdf09da00d4901d0682ec984d.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) ()
[21:33:59] <Grinnz> and yes, the fact that every node in XML contains a list is part of what makes it so difficult to represent as a data structure
[21:36:29] <xq> it's not hard, just not the datastructures that most people would like to work with :P
[21:36:56] <Grinnz> yeah, take a look at how it shows up in ->tree in Mojo::DOM to see the accurate data structure representation
[21:36:56] <vms14> they're just dom elements, aren't?
[21:37:14] <Grinnz> yes. and a dom is not easily represented by native hashes and arrays
[21:37:22] <vms14> but then you have dtds and stuff that adds stuff indirectly
[21:38:02] <xq> do you have a specific use case where you think that xml is better?
[21:38:35] <vms14> xq: no, just wanted to see if perl developers still use xml for some reason
[21:38:35] <Grinnz> speaking of dtds, it's wild to have a data format which depends on external urls
[21:38:50] <xq> some probably do
[21:38:56] <vms14> knowing all the xml modules perl has
[21:39:09] *** Quits: rindolf (~shlomif@2a0d:6fc2:4bb1:500:6b1e:2524:3d70:36ec) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:39:15] <xq> also, "use" is a broad term
[21:39:15] <Grinnz> mostly it's out of necessity for interaction with APIs that use XML
[21:39:38] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@2a0d:6fc2:4bb1:500:6b1e:2524:3d70:36ec)
[21:39:43] <xq> I "use" xml because I need to consome some files that the official source only publishes as xml
[21:39:53] <vms14> Grinnz: actually I was wondering if they used for representing stuff
[21:39:53] <xq> does this count as "use" ?
[21:40:14] <vms14> I suppose they just prefer sql csv json or other stuff to save data
[21:40:17] <Grinnz> not in my experience
[21:40:19] <Grinnz> yes
[21:40:35] <Grinnz> sql isn't a data format of course, but databases yes
[21:40:49] <vms14> but they could have some reason more than the number of xml modules 
[21:40:55] <xq> have you considered that some use cases of xml predate the existence of json?
[21:41:05] <xq> and 90% of the internet as we know it today?
[21:41:06] <vms14> xq: most of them
[21:41:22] <vms14> and also realized that json rules, not because it's better
[21:41:32] <vms14> but because javascript rules
[21:41:44] <vms14> and JSON.parse() is love
[21:42:16] <xq> also, last time I checked json did not have any dtd facilities
[21:42:36] <xq> other than a bunch of brand new "standards" in some unfinished state
[21:42:54] <xq> while xml dtd has been standardized for a long time
[21:43:23] <vms14> the only thing I like of xml is the strictness over html
[21:43:32] <xq> if I wanted to publish a json document with a dtd spec to go along with it today, I would not know what to use
[21:43:42] <vms14> where a <br> must be a <br></br>
[21:44:16] <vms14> verbosity is not a problem because you usually won't be coding xml, you'd output it with a function or whatever
[21:44:44] <vms14> and if you want speed xml must have a lot of xs options 
[21:45:17] <vms14> but this strictness guarantees consistency
[21:45:29] <vms14> a thing html does not have so you have to be aware
[21:46:08] <Grinnz> html5 is consistent, just has a bunch of exceptions :)
[21:48:16] <vms14> what I mean is it let's you standardize data, others can use your "protocol/specification" and with xml you know that you'll parse it correctly as long as their xml isn't broken, where in html you'd have to be aware of the edge cases and the user would be able to add their ones
[21:49:15] <vms14> json also is consistent, but xml is much less general
[21:50:15] <Grinnz> as long as you use an html5 parser like Mojo::DOM, html is parsed just as consistently
[21:50:21] <vms14> so I see a lot of reasons to use xml, that's why I wondered if some devs just didn't hear the "don't use xml" and had a real reason to prefer it
[21:50:30] <Grinnz> as for specification, json has schemas
[21:50:44] <vms14> I like Mojo::DOM
[21:51:13] <vms14> it's very easy to make a crawler with this module and the mojo ua
[21:51:37] <vms14> the mojo ua is async so it's what a crawler needs
[21:51:51] <vms14> and you can use a proxy, etc
