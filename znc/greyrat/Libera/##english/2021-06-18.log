[21:36:40] <TechTest> and turkish coffee is terrible
[21:37:25] <lall-> blkshp, cook it yourself.
[21:37:44] <lall-> yous need that copper pot thingie and good coffee.
[21:38:08] <blkshp> Got one, just i know it winds up TechTest that it's nicer than his.
[21:38:42] <TechTest> ok enough

[21:39:06] <blkshp> \o/
[21:39:27] <TechTest> actually what you call Turkish coffee is called greek coffee
[21:39:37] <TechTest> and we drink it in funerals
[21:39:59] <blkshp> How insulting is it if i say gamó ?
[21:40:01] <TechTest> blkshp is stocking up for his funeral I think
[21:40:09] <lall-> > First appearing in the Ottoman Empire, under the strictest interpretations of the Quran the strong coffee was considered a drug and its consumption was forbidden. Due to the immense popularity of the beverage, the sultan eventually lifted this prohibition.[11]
[21:40:16] <TechTest> blkshp: not much
[21:40:20] <TechTest> but good try lol
[21:40:29] <TimMc> (TechTest: *at funerals)
[21:40:34] <blkshp> xD
[21:40:38] <lall-> > In Greece, Turkish coffee was formerly referred to simply as 'Turkish' (τούρκικος)
[21:40:45] <TechTest> TimMc: thank you
[21:40:47] <lall-> strange that the greek would call their own coffee, "turkish" :)
[21:40:59] <blkshp> And there's nothing inherantly wrong with Starbucks.
[21:40:59] <TechTest> lall-: we call it Greek
[21:41:19] <TechTest> blkshp: when you say "gamo" you need to specify what
[21:41:35] <blkshp> you.
[21:41:41] <blkshp> >.>

[21:41:53] <blkshp> Oh...
[21:41:53] <TechTest> good to know
[21:41:55] <lall-> well, no, there's the price.
[21:42:03] <TechTest> I'm sorry dude I'm not into guys
[21:42:11] <blkshp> So, it doesn't have the same meaning as purely "fuck you"?
[21:42:26] <TechTest> not really
[21:42:27] * blkshp notes that down incase of misunderstandings later!
[21:42:29] <lall-> and next thing is... the labels. you have to have a freaking manual to figure out what you actually ordering
[21:42:29] <blkshp> lol
[21:42:47] <lall-> better just cook your own, eh?
[21:43:06] <TimMc> gamó means... cucumber?
[21:43:08] <blkshp> I do, 5889 of them in 4 years!
[21:43:10] <TechTest> if you want to use it as a swear word you need to use it with a noun like "fuck your house"
[21:43:18] <TechTest> that's an insulat
[21:43:40] <blkshp> But i do starbucks too. i like a grande 4 shot, 1/2 decaf skinny latte macchiato with Vanilla and a caramel drizzle.
[21:43:55] <TechTest> get a dessert instead
[21:44:07] <lall-> yeah see, that's just scary to me... i have no idea what that even means. Skinny latte macchiato
[21:44:14] <lall-> i just want a coffee mate...
[21:44:41] <lall-> then again. i grew up in Bosnia. Turkish coffee was pretty much standard. 
[21:44:41] <TimMc> blkshp: That sounds like warm ice cream.
[21:45:07] <blkshp> I you see am capable of consuming raw ingredients in many forms.
[21:45:48] <TechTest> I'm confused with your sense of taste
[21:45:51] <lall-> and decaf. that's like cigarettes with no nicotine in them lol
[21:45:57] <lall-> why smoke at all
[21:45:57] <blkshp> lall-: so it's lightly frothed skimmed milk about 200ml with with vanilla syrup with 4 shots of espresso in it.
[21:46:06] <blkshp> lall-: for the love of the taste.
[21:46:14] <TimMc> Oh, skim, right -- not ice cream. :-)
[21:46:16] <blkshp> If you just liek caffeine why not just take a caffeine pill?

[21:46:41] <blkshp> xD
[21:46:47] <TimMc> totally different things
[21:46:53] <blkshp> i regularly drink about 10 preparations of coffee
[21:47:33] <lall-> blkshp. depends on the culture. where i grew up, drinking coffee is a ritual. as for me personally, i would rather just take the pill, i don't enjoy the taste, and i've been on it for more than 15 years. (not anymore).
[21:47:49] <lall-> in some other countries, drinkin is not really a ritual, more like ... pick me up.
[21:47:59] <blkshp> I love the flavour of coffees
[21:48:20] <blkshp> and decaf beans are basically indestinguishable now
[21:48:33] <lall-> mango juice tastes better.
[21:48:41] <TechTest> pineapple juice
[21:48:46] <lall-> ^
[21:49:03] <blkshp> I like both of those.

[21:54:23] <blkshp> wedding the house?!
[21:54:31] <TimMc> you do you
[21:56:03] <twb> With turkish coffee, how do you stop the grounds being agitated up from the bottom when serving and drinking?
[21:56:22] <blkshp> lift it SLOWLY
[21:56:46] <twb> wikipedia says you just drink the grounds also
[21:56:57] <TechTest> blkshp: yes it also means wedding, actually LuisM14 made a typo, it's 'γαμω'
