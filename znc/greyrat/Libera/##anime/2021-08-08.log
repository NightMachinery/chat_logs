[03:47:20] <dfch> have an internet point you rando
[03:47:24] <theholyduck> theres very few routes with enough passengers on it to really make use of a plane that size
[03:47:28] <dfch> (non-bagel rando)
[03:47:29] <lastonestanding> because using one giant plane is better for the climate
[03:47:34] <lastonestanding> instead of several small ones
[03:47:44] <lastonestanding> no?
[03:47:55] <lastonestanding> for the major routes
[03:47:58] <theholyduck> only if everyone is actually flying the exact same routes
[03:48:14] <theholyduck> usually when you fly a massive plane like that
[03:48:20] <theholyduck> you then need to jump on another smaller plane

[03:48:43] <dfch> airspace is closed for laowais in china T_T
[03:48:49] <theholyduck> lastonestanding:  basicly the failure of the a380 is more and more airlines are transitioning to point to point routes
[03:49:00] <theholyduck> rather than going via a hub
[03:49:02] <rando25892> ive never seen one of those before
[03:49:16] <theholyduck> lol? most of the air traffic in europe alrleady works like that

[03:49:41] <dfch> theholyduck is right
[03:49:44] <theholyduck> but. its dying out there aswell
[03:49:56] <theholyduck> people would rather get on a plane that goes from where they are to where they are going
[03:50:02] <theholyduck> which usually means flying more smaller planes
[03:50:11] <theholyduck> also mid size planes can be very energy efficienct

[03:54:43] <theholyduck> and they sold 1500 747s over 50 years
[03:54:58] <dfch> I mean more of late 80s

[04:17:12] <ImoutoBot> lastonestanding: Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder.
[04:17:27] <lastonestanding> is that Bor?
[04:17:56] <lastonestanding> it's simply just "Bor" in German

[04:54:26] <TsundereNoises> crowd-sourced word pronunciation site
[04:58:48] <Nanobot> Nobody tells me how to pronounce words. Deliberately mispronouncing words is how I assert dominance.

[05:00:17] <TsundereNoises> anyway I'm hoping someone has an account so they can try to download any random audio file, I'm not sure if their site is dying or they've blocked my account from downloading files, but they aren't sending confirmation emails when I try to set up new accounts so at least something is wrong on their end
[05:00:19] <TsundereNoises> or at least slow
[05:00:30] <Nanobot> This burger is awful. I need to learn to stop trying out promotional items.
[05:00:36] <TsundereNoises> yes
[05:00:48] <TsundereNoises> although I kind of want to try one of those black squid-ink hamburger buns
[05:00:56] <TsundereNoises> what's your mistake-burger?
[05:01:26] <Nanobot> The delivery guy messed up my order and got something from the kids menu. Also forgot the BBQ sauce.
[05:02:05] <Nanobot> I ordered the Carl's Jr. California Classic double cheeseburger. This should really just be called the tinyburger.
[05:02:27] <TsundereNoises> do you not have a bottle of BBQ sauce in your house?
[05:02:37] <Nanobot> It's also too dry. It's basically their normal burger, but dryer (and smaller)
[05:02:40] <Nanobot> I don't.
[05:03:12] <TsundereNoises> special promotional worse cheeseburger
[05:03:37] <TsundereNoises> seriously buy some BBQ sauce though, I feel like all kinds of things can be saved with it
[05:04:13] <Nanobot> Supposedly, this was their attempt to mimic In-N-Out Burger (which I also don't like), but it's really nothing like In-N-Out.
[05:04:14] <TsundereNoises> having my own condiments is something I take for granted I guess, but I use them even on takeout often enough
[05:04:41] <emmeka> hi TsundereNoises
[05:04:55] <TsundereNoises> like the sushi place that used to deliver had a habit of only giving one soy sauce packet, just have a bottle of tamari in the fridge and you're good though
[05:04:58] <TsundereNoises> hi emmeka
[05:05:00] <TsundereNoises> long time no talk
[05:05:34] <Nanobot> Carl's Jr. is going through an existential crisis. They've been introducing items that are clearly intended to resemble popular items from other major burger chains.
[05:05:38] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I've been confused for YEARS about why people make such a big deal out of Jesus-burger
[05:05:49] <emmeka> I left you a message about a yuri anime yesterday, and here you are. the attractive force of yuri at work
[05:06:37] <Nanobot> In-N-Out Burger should be renamed to Boring Burger. It's just... a plain old burger.
[05:06:37] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: it's true, I am but a scrap of iron filing to the magnet of yuri
[05:06:55] <TsundereNoises> It's McDonalds with added Jesus
[05:07:06] <emmeka> TsundereNoises have you got around to this season's stuff yet?
[05:07:10] <TsundereNoises> but not the blood, because I do think wine would improve things
[05:07:22] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: no, I haven't got around to 2 seasons ago stuff either
[05:07:31] <emmeka> :(
[05:07:31] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I have watched like 10 episodes of anime total in 2021
[05:07:42] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: and I KNOW there are lots of things I will like
[05:08:08] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: but I did make a giant boldface note to myself about that anime
[05:08:22] <emmeka> ah well, make sure to get around to that one. I think it's flown under the radar a bit.
[05:08:34] <Nanobot> I'm watching Subaru play Final Fantasy VI.
[05:08:50] <emmeka> I picked it up for the slice of life, stayed for the yuri
[05:08:56] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I feel like most years, of my top 5 or so anime, 3 of them are ones everyone dismissed without watching
[05:08:59] <TsundereNoises> so I totally feel that
[05:09:37] <emmeka> I think it's anime original too
[05:11:08] <theholyduck> anime originals are always a bit weird to me
[05:11:10] <Nanobot> Hm... I have some sriracha sauce from whenever. Not expired yet. I wonder if that's any good on chicken tenders.
[05:11:35] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I mean, it's probably better than nothing
[05:11:37] <theholyduck> like. part of how a lot of anime get their funding is in relationship to their other media version
[05:11:42] <theholyduck> manga/lightnovel/whatever
[05:11:44] <TsundereNoises> also I'd definitely eat expired siracha
[05:12:08] <TsundereNoises> but anime originals are often the best anime
[05:12:13] <TsundereNoises> or at least the most interesting
[05:12:21] <theholyduck> i mean it definitly CAN be
[05:12:30] <Nanobot> Ehhh... the flavor combination doesn't really work. It makes it a bit less dry, though.
[05:12:51] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: bu like how they can even exist is a bit weird to me with how little a lot of anime sells 
[05:13:14] <Nanobot> I don't seem to have any ketchup, for some reason. I have mustard, but I don't think that would work well.
[05:13:20] <theholyduck> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anime_with_original_screenplays not that wikipedia lists are perfect or anything but theres some goof stuff here atleast
[05:13:20] <ImoutoBot> [title] Category:Anime with original screenplays - Wikipedia
[05:13:27] <Nanobot> I have mayo, but that's a bit much.
[05:13:30] <theholyduck> i mean theres some stuff i have never heard about aswell though
[05:13:42] <Nanobot> Teriyaki sauce...
[05:13:57] <theholyduck> and a few like weird flops
[05:14:04] <theholyduck> like how the guy who i think directed? or was it wrote
[05:14:06] <theholyduck> fractale
[05:14:11] <theholyduck> ended up quitting the industry for a while
[05:14:14] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: honey mustard works okay with chicken, if you have regular mustard and honey you could make it
[05:14:24] * ButterNoodle cums
[05:14:46] <theholyduck> but sure theres some quality stuff on this list. :D 
[05:15:39] <theholyduck> man the wikipedia spelling of it weirds me out but "den-noh coil"
[05:15:47] <theholyduck> is so good 
[05:15:53] <theholyduck> especially the episode where they grow beards
[05:16:00] <theholyduck> top 10 filler episode
[05:16:00] <theholyduck> easily
[05:16:35] <emmeka> theholyduck tbf, anime original doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't a manga or lightnovel or whatever planned to be released with or following the anime series, it just means that the anime is first and is the source material
[05:16:54] <theholyduck> SURE: but in that case the manga is what i asume is profiting of it
[05:16:58] <theholyduck> or whatever
[05:17:03] <ButterNoodle> I got roped into manual labor when I went over to my moms :|
[05:17:05] <theholyduck> its like we are making this thing anyway. manga is cheap to make
[05:17:09] <theholyduck> so why not make one of those aswell
[05:17:19] <ButterNoodle> best to just stay away
[05:17:25] <marblesurf> k back
[05:17:33] <theholyduck> oh. dennou coil reminds me of one of the funniest trolling of weebs i ever saw
[05:18:11] <theholyduck> some guy started like a rumor on i think it was 4chan /a/ ? at the time 
[05:18:31] <theholyduck> that the anime version was heavily censored 
[05:18:33] <theholyduck> compared to the manga
[05:18:43] <theholyduck> and posting images 
[05:18:48] <theholyduck> (of what was scans of like doujins)
[05:19:07] <theholyduck> and weebs were mad there werent more loli nudity in the anime version
[05:19:12] <theholyduck> if it was in the manga
[05:19:15] <ButterNoodle> were there H scenes?
[05:19:25] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: the joke is there wasnt a dennou coil manga
[05:19:27] <theholyduck> its a anime original
[05:19:27] <theholyduck> :D
[05:19:37] <ButterNoodle> ic
[05:19:43] <ButterNoodle> *I'm gonna use that
[05:19:49] <ButterNoodle> decent troll
[05:20:04] <theholyduck> but like 00's weebs would get so mad at any mention of censorship of anything
[05:20:19] <emmeka> same as it ever was
[05:20:23] <ButterNoodle> *still do
[05:20:26] <ButterNoodle> but
[05:20:33] <Nanobot> I wonder if someone can convince a HoloJP member that the English term for a new song is "new ditty".
[05:20:38] <ButterNoodle> there are decency standards in public media
[05:20:38] <emmeka> look at the stupidity of the Dragon Maid thing
[05:20:49] <theholyduck> sure. but i think they somewhat turned down the outragousness of it. 
[05:20:54] <ButterNoodle> idk
[05:20:55] <TsundereNoises> yeah there was that whole big shitfit about suggoi dekkai a while back
[05:20:58] <theholyduck> like less stuff is being made in japan thats like full pedo
[05:21:07] <ButterNoodle> twitter be blowin up over the slightest thing
[05:21:09] <theholyduck> where as the japanese version of ichigo mashimaro has like full frontal 
[05:21:21] <TsundereNoises> not only do some people get outraged over any little thing, weebs get disproportionately outraged right back
[05:21:25] <Nanobot> Watching Subaru play FF6 is great. She's playing it like a true RPG player. Searching every room for secrets. She got to an area she isn't supposed to get to yet, because she was snooping around.
[05:21:27] <ButterNoodle> neck beards be breathin real loud on the twitter
[05:21:41] <ButterNoodle> banging the keys real hard too
[05:21:57] <theholyduck> so i think theres like LESS cases of the fully pedo stuff being censored in anime or censored in he west
[05:21:57] <ButterNoodle> over jahy
[05:21:58] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I like watching Miko play FF games to look up the skirts of her party members
[05:22:00] <theholyduck> as theres just less of it being made
[05:22:11] <emmeka> theholyduck people were eternally mad at Funimation because Funimation changed a throwaway joke that Lucoa, a minor character makes. They changed the line so complains about "patriarchal norms" instead of just dismissing it.
[05:22:18] <ButterNoodle> over 24 yo asian girls that look 12 - they should be euthanized... etc
[05:22:25] <emmeka> weebs collectively lost their shit, at the time
[05:22:37] <emmeka> and screamed censorship even though it... didn't really censor anything
[05:22:41] <theholyduck> emmeka: :P 
[05:23:02] <TsundereNoises> I love how deepl just makes shit up that SOUNDS natural, but people treat it like it's so much better than google translate
[05:23:07] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: there's a big difference between translators being idiots and censorship tho
[05:23:17] <TsundereNoises> at least google translate acknowledges it's spitting out gibberish

[05:24:04] <theholyduck> just according to keikaku is a joke for a good reason :P
[05:24:12] <TsundereNoises> *keikaku means plan
[05:24:27] <theholyduck> there was so much of that crap in fansubs of the era
[05:24:28] <ButterNoodle> I think engrish translators are better at trolling than weebs are tbh
[05:24:30] <theholyduck> im so glad fansubbing is dead
[05:24:32] <TsundereNoises> to be fair, commie were deliberately memeing
[05:24:34] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[05:24:35] <TsundereNoises> as is their wont
[05:24:45] <emmeka> I actually like the liberties some localizations take
[05:24:54] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: i mean by the time commie entered the scene fansubbing was basicly dead anyway
[05:24:54] <TsundereNoises> also I'm so sad fansubbing isn't more alive
[05:24:56] <theholyduck> if memory seres
[05:25:03] <TsundereNoises> because official subs are often not even half assed
[05:25:04] <emmeka> look at Shimoneta. It's an endless string of Japanese puns. It would NEVER work as a direct translation
[05:25:07] <TsundereNoises> more like 1/10th assed
[05:25:15] <TsundereNoises> official subs never translate songs these days
[05:25:17] <Nanobot> I like how Subaru named Shadow "Aqua", because he's a loner.
[05:25:20] <emmeka> but the dub just fucking throws out every pun and makes up their own, and it's amazing
[05:25:20] <TsundereNoises> especially in music anime
[05:25:27] <theholyduck> emmeka: i mean you SAY that :P but thats like the version of bakemonogatari. 
[05:25:32] <Macer> Watching aico again. 
[05:25:34] <theholyduck> that existed when i watched it when it aired
[05:25:42] <theholyduck> i have no idea of if theres now a better translation of bakemonogatari around
[05:25:46] <Macer> It was actually decent. 
[05:25:50] <emmeka> theholyduck the puns of Shimoneta are dumb sex jokes, they're not high brow
[05:25:56] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: okay, you have me convinced to watch some subaru FF

[05:26:15] <theholyduck> and yet thats the fansub that existed
[05:26:24] <theholyduck> mostly it just barely made sense in english
[05:26:25] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: The original stream was privated or deleted
[05:26:31] <theholyduck> and i asume 90% of the meaning was lost
[05:26:35] <theholyduck> and yet weebs still watch that shit
[05:26:40] <TsundereNoises> monogatari really is an example of something that needs some kind of translator notes, honestly
[05:26:48] <TsundereNoises> as much as they are often stupid
[05:26:59] <theholyduck> i mean partialyl that. and partially what it needed was like 
[05:26:59] <emmeka> theholyduck right. Funimation decided to go fuck it and just throw every single pun out for some series, and make up their own puns
[05:27:03] <emmeka> and honestly. it's better.
[05:27:04] <theholyduck> some real pro translation
[05:27:15] <Macer> TsundereNoises: it‚Äôs hard enough to keep up with the dialogue. 
[05:27:17] <marblesurf> love the monogatari series
[05:27:18] <Macer> Lol
[05:27:21] <emmeka> is it true to the original? no. but I don't speak Japanese, and it's great to watch.
[05:27:22] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: like what murakami novels get
[05:27:22] <theholyduck> :P
[05:27:30] <Macer> Lots of blabbering in monogatari 
[05:27:43] <marblesurf> one of my favorite anime of all time really
[05:27:46] <theholyduck> marblesurf: im not a big fan. in part because the translation just feels so bad
[05:27:49] <TsundereNoises> Macer: >>not pausing to read the text walls
[05:27:55] <Macer> Yeah haha
[05:28:02] <Macer> It can be a pain. 
[05:28:10] <theholyduck> like it just doesnt work in any english version i have interacted with on anything but hte most basic level
[05:28:10] <marblesurf> yeah i guess
[05:28:14] <Macer> Even worse when there are notes. 
[05:28:25] <theholyduck> like it works fine if you just take it as a surface level love story thing
[05:28:27] <marblesurf> i still enjoyed it but probably no one can't enjoy it as much as japanese people
[05:28:30] <theholyduck> the dialogue is clunky
[05:28:34] <theholyduck> but it WORKS
[05:28:36] <TsundereNoises> I love monogatari
[05:28:38] <Macer> Monogatari and FLCL were tough to keep up with. 
[05:28:42] <Macer> For subs. 
[05:28:50] <emmeka> just watch the dub of FLCL
[05:28:51] <theholyduck> but. thats not why people watch issin stuff
[05:28:55] <theholyduck> flcl dub is legendary
[05:28:55] <emmeka> it's basically obligatory
[05:29:02] <TsundereNoises> like monogatari is one of the anime that has actually moved me to tears at one point
[05:29:06] <TsundereNoises> I'm a bit of a sap but still
[05:29:14] <marblesurf> yeah theholyduck 
[05:29:15] <Macer> emmeka: I didn‚Äôt have it. I may try the dub tomorrow. 
[05:29:18] <emmeka> fun fact: the director of FLCL actually liked some of the dub castings better than the original
[05:29:32] <theholyduck> flcl was like weirdly good compared to any other dub i remotely ran into
[05:29:33] <Macer> It is rare that dubs work out. 
[05:29:35] <theholyduck> around that time
[05:29:42] <emmeka> and FLCL was actually the first dub where the localization team worked directly with the Japanese studio
[05:29:53] <Macer> I thought the heavens lost property dub worker better than the Japanese. 
[05:30:07] <emmeka> sometimes they actually just outright speak Japanese in the dub of FLCL anyway, or at least, Haruka does
[05:30:18] <theholyduck> emmeka: but yeah like any other turn of the milenia dub i ran into was just. so bad
[05:30:36] <theholyduck> flcl was like THE example that dubbing could be good
[05:30:37] <theholyduck> at the time
[05:30:40] <emmeka> there's others.
[05:30:53] <Nanobot> In Zelda, a ghost is called a "poe". Did you know that they have legs? The legs are just separate. You can find a shop that sells poe shins.
[05:30:57] <theholyduck> might have been i guess. but back then so few shows even made it over ANYWAY 
[05:31:02] <emmeka> it's true that the major voice acting studios of the time were... not good
[05:31:25] <emmeka> but there were occasional projects where weebs got the reigns in a way they never could now
[05:31:40] <emmeka> before anime was big money in the west, and before fansubs
[05:31:40] <Macer> emmeka: you mean the one with the same 3 voice actors? Lol
[05:31:44] <emmeka> nah.
[05:32:04] <Macer> I thought the hsotd dub was ok. 
[05:32:16] <emmeka> I mean, yes, major voice acting outfits did that, because anime localization was garbage-tier work at the time that barely paid
[05:32:16] <theholyduck> complain about same 3 voice actors. forgets rie kugimiya played the same character in like 30 different anime
[05:32:31] <Macer> theholyduck: lol! That‚Äôs true. 
[05:32:55] <theholyduck> i much later than that rewatched yakitate japan
[05:32:56] <theholyduck> for some reason
[05:33:01] <theholyduck> and it was so weird to hear her as NOT a tsundere
[05:33:06] *** Quits: marblesurf (~plex@user/marblesurf) (Quit: cya)
[05:33:17] <theholyduck> she did the exact same voice. but. it was before she just got typecast
[05:33:21] <Macer> Haha 
[05:33:34] <theholyduck> man yakitate japan was a good show
[05:33:47] <theholyduck> it derps a bit towards the end but whatever
[05:34:06] <theholyduck> its like the OG shounen cooking battle anime
[05:34:29] <theholyduck> theres been some since. but as far as IM aware its like the genre definer

[06:01:04] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: kuragehime is tagged josei on anidb. Nana was also tagged josei. But even tho I agree the content is very adult. It was published on ribbon which is a shoujo manga magazine which makes me wonder what is their standard for tagging
[06:01:55] <Urchin[emacs]> hi TsundereNoises 
[06:02:20] <theholyduck> anidb isnt always the best on stuff  
[06:02:21] <theholyduck> :P
[06:02:28] <theholyduck> i agree nana is a shoujou and kuragehime is josei
[06:02:59] <theholyduck> amigojapan: neither were published in ribbon though
[06:02:59] <theholyduck> :P

[06:03:41] <TsundereNoises> hi urchin
[06:03:44] <theholyduck> i mean it might have been called ribbon at the time
[06:03:47] <theholyduck> its apparently called cookie
[06:03:48] <theholyduck> today
[06:03:49] <theholyduck> :P
[06:04:25] <theholyduck> nvm it wasnt
[06:04:41] <TsundereNoises> well I THINK (as always) that categorizing the genre of things based on where they were published is stupid and pointless
[06:04:45] <theholyduck> it was published in cookie which is a more grown up version of ribbon
[06:04:49] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  its not a genre is the point
[06:05:00] <theholyduck> anyone who uses that label for genre is just wrong
[06:05:02] <TsundereNoises> either we stop categorizing based on publication, or we stop treating those categories as genres
[06:05:03] <theholyduck> 100% 
[06:05:06] <TsundereNoises> but the 2nd will be impossible

[06:06:04] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  i mean it is in terms of target audience
[06:06:08] <theholyduck> which is what we are going for with that tag
[06:06:08] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: like the magazine a short story was published in doesn't tell you much about it, we don't make a huge deal of that, just a note in the back of the collection
[06:06:13] <TsundereNoises> but for anime and manga, it's HUGE
[06:06:14] <theholyduck> its a rough guestimate at target audience
[06:06:24] <MootPoot> Didn't theholyduck and amigojapan lose their shit on me over this a couple months back
[06:06:35] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  i mean if you were using it as a genre tag then probably :P 
[06:06:38] <MootPoot> We were talking about Shonen and shoujo
[06:06:39] <theholyduck> i havent given up the fight yet
[06:06:41] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: and it's misleading so often that we should just stop making such a big deal about it
[06:06:51] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: i dont make a big deal about it. i never use it for anything
[06:06:54] <ButterNoodle> what happen
[06:06:59] <theholyduck> im just not. going to pretend it means anything other than waht it means
[06:07:00] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: I think that was an extra typo on top of the wrong keyboard
[06:07:07] <TsundereNoises> „ÅÜr„Å°„Çì
[06:07:13] <rando25892> have you seen ghost in the shell 2?
[06:07:15] <MootPoot> And you lot were ranting on about how it only really matters where it was published
[06:07:16] <TsundereNoises> now it's not being funny at all
[06:07:31] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I'm sore
[06:07:35] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: yes but 95% of the internet uses it to make wrong statements
[06:07:41] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  its the actual japanese and only consident defintiion of what the terms mean
[06:07:42] <theholyduck> yes
[06:07:48] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: and putting the information as front and center as we do only encourages that
[06:07:57] <ButterNoodle> I'll spit on it first next time
[06:07:57] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: again I DONt
[06:08:10] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: where it's published IS the only thing it means
[06:08:24] <MootPoot> No
[06:08:31] <MootPoot> In Japanese maybe
[06:08:34] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: His holiness and I agree on what it means, we're just arguing anyway
[06:08:48] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: if they are not genres then we should not use the same name treating it as a genre
[06:08:52] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i mean people INTERPRET it to mean other things
[06:08:58] <MootPoot> But the same way hentai in English and Japanese mean something different
[06:08:59] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING
[06:09:02] <MootPoot> It works here too
[06:09:05] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  except it doesnt
[06:09:09] <amigojapan> Ah ok TsundereNoises

[06:10:06] <theholyduck> they dont give a shounen/shoujou/seinen/josei tag
[06:10:10] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: no it's accurate, I'm complaining about it's PROMINENCE
[06:10:13] <theholyduck> if theres no way to determine it :P
[06:10:24] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: i mean. we probably should
[06:10:31] <theholyduck> but the point im trying to make to MootPoot 
[06:10:38] <theholyduck> is if they are deriving any meaning from that tag
[06:10:39] <MootPoot> theholyduck would also be the dude ranging about clip vs magazine in the corner of the range to whoever would listen
[06:10:40] <theholyduck> being in a database

[06:10:50] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  ok. the problem with your thing is this
[06:10:55] <theholyduck> you think the word shounen means something
[06:10:58] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: never heard of it
[06:11:05] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  but everyone who decides if the word shounen 
[06:11:07] * MootPoot pats theholyduck 
[06:11:08] <theholyduck> is used on wikipedia

[06:11:15] <theholyduck> to tag an anime
[06:11:16] <theholyduck> agrees with me
[06:11:28] <theholyduck> and its consistently used the way I use it and the way the japanese uise it
[06:11:41] <theholyduck> sooo. when you read that word on the internet. and you take any meaning other than the meaning it has in japanese
[06:11:42] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: crowdsourced pronunciation site that's currently not letting me download things and I'm trying to figure out if the site is borked or it's blocked me due to too many requests
[06:11:44] <theholyduck> you are just wrong. 
[06:11:45] <ButterNoodle> are we talkin about hentai?
[06:11:56] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i dont disagree that the english fanbase has their own murky "definition"
[06:11:58] <theholyduck> of the word
[06:12:09] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  but thats never whats put into the tag field on a database
[06:12:17] <theholyduck> or almost never anyway
[06:12:20] <theholyduck> it gets weird on anime originals
[06:12:21] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: you're absolutely right, but I think the way sites treat the word, even when using it correctly, perpetuates the incorrect usage

[06:12:29] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: oh i dont disagree on that at all
[06:12:36] <theholyduck> they should just stop using that word
[06:12:42] <theholyduck> but. seeing as they generally do use it correctly
[06:12:49] <theholyduck> MootPoot: should maybe stop relying on the way THEY use that word
[06:12:52] <theholyduck> when looking at anime
[06:12:55] <MootPoot> Ok, so what is the exact definition of Shonen that everyone agrees on?
[06:13:03] <ButterNoodle> because this hentai is feelin hentai and wants to fap to sum hentai.... hentai's
[06:13:04] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: published in a shounen magazine
[06:13:23] <theholyduck> a shounen magazine is a magazine targeted at boys. and younger ones. so it will have furigana
[06:13:25] <theholyduck> on the character
[06:13:29] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: which, as I'm saying, is stupid, but that's how the definition comes about, which is how you get weird shit like Yotsuba& being shounen
[06:13:31] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: so how do you suggest we say "this anime appeals to a female adult audience"or "this anime is aimed at small boys"?
[06:13:50] <theholyduck> MootPoot: so thats the distinction between a shounen and a seinen magazine
[06:13:53] <theholyduck> they are both targeted at boys

[06:14:03] <theholyduck> but the shounen will have furigana on the kanji
[06:14:07] <theholyduck> and the seinen generally wont
[06:14:15] <rando25892> good point likes how operating code and sharing the api comes about naturally as does anime categories

[06:14:22] <MootPoot> Sh≈çnen manga (Â∞ëÂπ¥Êº´Áîª), also romanized as shonen or shounen, are Japanese comics marketed towards young teen boys in junior high school to high school age. 
[06:14:31] <MootPoot> That's the wiki def
[06:14:35] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: because I watch almost exclusively stuff targeted at women, for example
[06:14:37] <TsundereNoises> or little girls
[06:14:40] <MootPoot> That you say everyone agrees on
[06:14:54] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and if I recall, emmeka's wife likes stuff aimed at men
[06:15:01] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  seems about right. but the way you know its a shounen is the furigana thing :P

[06:15:04] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: you're not exactly normal in your tastes
[06:15:07] <theholyduck> sometimes theres very little gap between a seinen
[06:15:08] <theholyduck> and a shounen
[06:15:16] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I don't think anyone claimed they were genres in the sense of those
[06:15:16] <theholyduck> and the way you tell is the furigana

[06:16:00] <amigojapan> theholyduck: the gap is who is the target audience
[06:16:03] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: yes but gender stereotypes as a basis of defining genres are bullshit
[06:16:15] <theholyduck> amigojapan: sure but like shounen jump has a pretty large female readership
[06:16:17] <theholyduck> if memory serves
[06:16:22] <MootPoot> theholyduck turns into a Canadian goose when protecting his manga labels

[06:17:34] <amigojapan> theholyduck: those females like boyish things in same as I like girlish things
[06:17:52] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: which is why defining them by target gender is stupid

[06:19:13] <theholyduck> because the tags are so  ubiquitos. some places ( mal if memory serves) is guilty of this. 
[06:19:16] <TsundereNoises> out of curiosity
[06:19:25] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: Cancer
[06:19:30] <TsundereNoises> mal is guilty of basically only making bad decisions
[06:19:40] *** Joins: Mr_Misery (~weechat@110.44.115.202)
[06:19:45] <theholyduck> so yeah they will put a tag where its not warranted
[06:19:50] * TsundereNoises kuma punches MootPoot
[06:19:55] <theholyduck> basicly all light novels will generally just be tagged seinen
[06:20:01] <MootPoot> Reminds me of that gal dino an anime
[06:20:02] <theholyduck> almost irregardless
[06:20:02] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: I disagree, shounen category helps me see things that are likely worth avoiding at a glance
[06:20:05] <MootPoot> Wtf was that
[06:20:12] <theholyduck> meanwhile on anime original somebody just makes a value judgment and wierd shit happens

[06:20:32] <theholyduck> wikipedia is generally better about  this
[06:20:35] <MootPoot> How much weed did they have to take to come up with that
[06:20:40] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: funny, but sometimes perfectly good shit gets tagged as shounen because of magazine publication
[06:20:43] <TsundereNoises> but yeah
[06:20:49] <theholyduck> it wont GIVE  one of these tags out on a page that doesnt have a published manga
[06:21:05] <theholyduck> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_of_the_East like it just doesnt have a tag

[06:21:11] <theholyduck> which i think is the right move for anime originals
[06:21:20] <theholyduck> but ive seen sites try to tag eden of the east as josei
[06:21:23] <TsundereNoises> and they'd be better off if they just stopped giving the tags, and just listed the manga of first publication
[06:21:23] <theholyduck> as it has a female protagonist

[06:22:35] <theholyduck> mal does the right thing. no tag. 
[06:23:04] <theholyduck> anidb claims its a josei
[06:23:06] <theholyduck> like fuck of anidb
[06:23:40] <theholyduck> anime-planet has a "original work" tag. also good
[06:23:50] <theholyduck> ok. lets try something more complicated.. shinsekai yori
[06:23:54] <theholyduck> its originally just like a full fucking novel 
[06:24:01] <theholyduck> it has a weird porn manga adaption
[06:24:05] <theholyduck> thats almost entirely unrelated
[06:24:44] <theholyduck> wikipedia tags the show as nothing but correctly tags the manga as being published in a shounen magazine (again its VERY different from the show)
[06:24:48] <TsundereNoises> Kaguya-sama and NNB are both Seinen, weird
[06:25:07] <theholyduck> mal tags it as nothing. also fair
[06:25:33] <theholyduck> anidb does the right thing and tags it as nothing... 
[06:25:41] <theholyduck> why did it tag eden of the east as josei?
[06:25:51] <theholyduck> anidb WHY?
[06:26:12] <amigojapan> What's weird about nnb being seinen TsundereNoises ?
[06:26:21] <MootPoot> I hit myself in the face with a water bottle
[06:26:26] <MootPoot> Split my lip
[06:26:49] <MootPoot> Bah
[06:27:03] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I don't know, just not what I expected
[06:27:18] <theholyduck> anyways. of all these sites i generally prefer wikipedia :P 
[06:27:26] <theholyduck> because they split the genre tags
[06:27:29] <theholyduck> from the demogrpahic tags
[06:27:34] <theholyduck> where as anidb/mal/anime-planet
[06:27:37] <theholyduck> puts them in the same category
[06:27:56] <rando25892> looking at mal they put like 10 words in genre

[06:28:04] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 20kB
[06:28:05] <rando25892> its pretty specific
[06:28:05] <TsundereNoises> I think anime-planet tends to be well-designed around this stuff (not sure on these, but tags in general)
[06:28:11] <TsundereNoises> just their database sucks on older shows
[06:28:20] <MootPoot> Some teacher: WiKiPedIa iS nOt A ReAl soUrCE
[06:28:28] <rando25892> im looking at ninja scrolls the series
[06:28:31] <theholyduck> anime-planet is a more recent project. i used to hang out on the internet with the woman who made it
[06:28:38] <MootPoot> Fuck off Mrs Davis
[06:28:43] <theholyduck> but its more of few people project
[06:28:45] <theholyduck> than these other oens
[06:28:48] <TsundereNoises> it's funny, english wikipedia has gotten MUCH better in the last 20 years or so, but apparently that's less true for other languages
[06:28:56] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: and were am I supposed to look for girlish stuff if it is not tagged at all?
[06:29:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: by using better genres
[06:29:30] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: for example, I know it's kind of fan-speak, but cute girls doing cute things is a useful tag
[06:29:33] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: but yeah like the wikipedia list of like "it ran in this magazine. which is a "seinen magazine"
[06:29:34] <theholyduck> i think is fine
[06:29:35] <MootPoot> Use all the autistic high functioning people to maintain it
[06:29:43] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: not everyone knows if miracle jump or whatever
[06:29:50] <theholyduck> is a seinen or shounen magazine
[06:29:55] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: but we're all busy arguing in irc all day
[06:30:07] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: yeah I think that's pretyt much ideal
[06:30:16] <MootPoot> Go argue in wikipedia forms
[06:30:26] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  as i said i mostly just use wikipedia. it lists all the sequels and spinoffs neatly on 1 page
[06:30:39] <theholyduck> it has the info i actually care about
[06:30:40] <theholyduck> like who wrote it
[06:30:43] <theholyduck> and what company made it
[06:30:45] <theholyduck> and who directed
[06:30:45] <theholyduck> etc
[06:31:04] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: how would you tag very girlish things like sailor moon or precure?
[06:31:04] <theholyduck> ann has the best database of people though
[06:31:20] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: magical girls
[06:31:35] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: precure isn't the same genre as NNB, and neither is the same genre as Sakura Trick

[09:45:26] <amigojapan> Hi again ButterNoodle 
[09:45:27] <ButterNoodle> funny and trash
[09:46:22] <ButterNoodle> yo amigojapan 
[09:46:27] <emmeka> amigojapan "polycule" is the word polyamorous people (ie, people who don't adhere to monogamy as a sexual identity) use to describe their extended network of relationships
[09:47:33] <amigojapan> Ah ok emmeka . Something I am very much against
[09:47:44] * emmeka shrugs
[09:48:11] <amigojapan> I don't think it can go well
[09:48:24] <emmeka> I'm like 2 generations removed from a culture where if you fucked your buddy's wife, it was like the ultimate form of friendship and made you and your buddy officially cousins
[09:48:35] <ButterNoodle> can only deal with one womans bullshit at a time
[09:48:49] <emmeka> and in which you could have multiple wives, and women could be married to multiple men
[09:49:07] <emmeka> not much else to do to ride out 8 months of winter
[09:50:51] <emmeka> ButterNoodle same. I don't have any issues with polyamory as a thing, but my reaction is consistently "man, where do you find the time? I can barely keep one woman happy."
[09:50:59] <amigojapan> emmeka: pokyanorous people lack commitment to someone
[09:51:23] <emmeka> amigojapan well that's not necessarily accurate, many of their relationships are quite formalized and committed.
[09:51:39] <ButterNoodle> I mean.. the though of a few cute girls at the house are nice...
[09:52:52] <emmeka> ButterNoodle idk man, imagine the benefits on the flipside. 2 husbands in the house... always someone to watch anime with... you can take turns having to deal with wifestuff
[09:53:03] <ButterNoodle> tru
[09:54:23] <amigojapan> That assumes you wont be jealous of the other husband
[09:54:37] <ButterNoodle> if he's cute.. ig its ok
[09:54:44] <emmeka> ^
[09:55:05] <amigojapan> I'm not ok
[09:55:41] <emmeka> that's fine and all, but you should probably reflect on the fact that that's probably more cultural than absolute truth
[09:56:14] <amigojapan> It's probably evolutionary
[09:56:18] <emmeka> sure, christendom frowns on these things. but that's not the case for all cultures on this earth and most of those are fine.
[09:57:01] <emmeka> evolutionary would imply that monogamy is a human universal, this is pretty far from the truth.
[09:58:42] <amigojapan> Well it is not going well for most people either
[09:59:08] <ButterNoodle> at least there would be more income in the household
[10:01:44] <isekaijin> Tax benefits are usually designed for couples, not for... uh... relationships involving larger groups of people.
[10:03:06] <emmeka> isekaijin yes well, the law outright forbids legal constructs like marriage for relationships of more than 2
[10:03:49] <emmeka> for reasons that are a decent mix of Christian moralizing and lawyers screaming because it would make everything way more complicated
[10:04:36] <isekaijin> Suppose for the sake of simplicity that this relationship involves two women and two men. These people could form two normal couples, each of which could have, on average, say, 1.8 children. But would these relationships of four have, on average, 3.6 children?
[10:04:47] <amigojapan> emmeka: it would and does make everything more complicated. It's not all fun and games
[10:05:07] <isekaijin> If your country is already having issues with immigrants trying to replace the locals, then the locals having on average less children is also a demographic problem.
[10:05:21] <emmeka> but there's some exceptions, for example, my country legally recognizes birth certificates with more than 2 parents listed on it. This arose from a polyamorous couple, 2 men and 1 women, who had a child together. The law granted custodial rights to only the first husband. They sued the government, and won.
[10:06:53] <emmeka> amigojapan idk personally I'm not comfortable with "lawyers would have to work harder" as a reason for why people aren't allowed to do things
[10:07:46] <amigojapan> emmeka: not only lawyers. It would be harder on everyone
[10:08:14] <emmeka> isekaijin I feel like poly families might be more likely to have more children per women? At the very least, they have more incomes in the household, which makes paying for children easier, and makes arranging childcare easier.
[10:08:25] <emmeka> I wonder if anyone's studied that.
[10:09:02] <emmeka> amigojapan how, exactly? idk man, seems prejudiced.
[10:10:01] <emmeka> if there's 3 (or... more...) consenting adults that all wanna sleep in the same bed and be married to each other then fuckin whatever man, it's a free country, you do you.
[10:10:23] <emmeka> if this is problematic for the law, then the law is problematic, not the people.
[10:10:43] <amigojapan> emmeka: the people who I know who have been in pokyanorous relationships have not seemed happy. And as I said there will still be jelousy and competition between the different members. Not just cooperation
[10:11:21] <isekaijin> Well, there is often jealousy even in relationships of two...
[10:11:27] <emmeka> well, as a counterpoint to your pointless anecdote, I have known others who are fine, and would point to literally all of my ancestors
[10:11:55] <emmeka> who were happily wifeswapping in the dead of winter for millenia
[10:13:02] <amigojapan> In polyamory the alpha male will end up with all the women
[10:13:16] <emmeka> what are we, dogs
[10:13:33] <amigojapan> The beta males won't even have the courage to complain
[10:14:43] <amigojapan> emmeka: if you disestablished things like monogamy, there would be little difference between humans and dogs
[10:15:01] <isekaijin> What.
[10:15:15] <ButterNoodle> yes
[10:15:16] <emmeka> again, you're acting as if monogamy is a human cultural universal, it isn't.
[10:15:22] <emmeka> it's just a judeochristian one.
[10:15:25] <isekaijin> amigojapan: The vast majority of people would be monogamous whether it is mandated by the law or not.
[10:15:29] <ButterNoodle> bring in all the betas for the extra income
[10:15:34] <ButterNoodle> and to take out the trash
[10:15:48] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I hope so
[10:16:42] <emmeka> amigojapan your argument seems fundamentally sexist, too. That if we allow women the choice of... how many relationships to be in... then "lesser" men would no longer be able to reign them in and they'd all just flock to the alpha males in vast harems
[10:16:59] <ButterNoodle> alpha males fuck
[10:17:01] <ButterNoodle> and thats all
[10:17:32] <Sadale> so the toki pona day event's ended.
[10:17:34] <amigojapan> That is twisting what I said emmeka 
[10:17:46] <Sadale> It's so much fun. Sad to see that it's ended. :3
[10:17:54] <isekaijin> Sadale: Was it an online event?
[10:17:57] <Sadale> isekaijin, yep
[10:18:02] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: I watched ur video
[10:18:14] <isekaijin> Sadale: Hosted where?
[10:18:17] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, cool! It's a tutorial of building a useless device xD

[10:18:21] <Sadale> isekaijin, stupid discord
[10:18:30] <amigojapan> emmeka: I am just saying that the commitment between one man and one woman is the ideal relationship
[10:18:30] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yes
[10:18:32] <Sadale> isekaijin, But I had to join. So I joined there anyway. :(

[10:19:48] <isekaijin> The Discord server made by someone from the old #anime was a rather unwelcoming place, but I am currently on several other Discord servers (mostly lurking, though) and things are fine.
[10:20:09] <ButterNoodle> which on isekaijin
[10:20:19] <ButterNoodle> I need more discord friends tbh
[10:23:59] <Arcorann> I decided to take a break from Discord a while back so that it wouldn't lead me to procrastinate so much. Turns out I found other things to procrastinate with instead
[10:24:00] <isekaijin> The ones that I can tell I am in are /r/OneTrueKongou, Danbooru and Arknights Official.
[10:24:12] <isekaijin> Arcorann: lol
[10:24:28] <amigojapan> emmeka: sea lions fight over who is the boss of the flock
[10:24:31] <isekaijin> There is no shortage of things one can do to procrastinate one's duties.

[15:23:26] <lastonestanding> specs and price look good
[15:24:10] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: I've not been following hardware development for quite a while now, probably not since around 2016
[15:24:22] <Bco1981> does that only have 1 stick of ram in it ?
[15:24:23] <lastonestanding> how is that possible?
[15:24:26] <KatrinValerie> So I cannot really tell, nor do I have any idea what an adequate price would be
[15:24:30] <lastonestanding> yes, 1x 16
[15:24:45] <Bco1981> that's lost performance
[15:24:51] <lastonestanding> why?
[15:24:52] <KatrinValerie> You want at least two for dual channel
[15:24:58] <Bco1981> ^
[15:25:00] <KatrinValerie> That has been that way for decades
[15:25:08] <lastonestanding> but you don't use the integrated gpu
[15:25:14] <lastonestanding> it has a 1660 super
[15:25:23] <Bco1981> today with amd systems, you are getting the most out of your cpu+ram with 4 sticks
[15:25:36] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: it means that your cpu can pump more data through the ram, because you have two channels to talk to the ram chips
[15:25:55] <lastonestanding> not really
[15:26:04] <lastonestanding> it's only a minimal difference
[15:26:15] <lastonestanding> unless you use the integrated gpu
[15:26:21] <lastonestanding> which you don't in this case
[15:26:35] <KatrinValerie> Eh, I can think of usecases where it matters anyways
[15:26:37] <Bco1981> still measureable even with higher end gpu's
[15:26:48] <lastonestanding> 5%?
[15:26:58] <Bco1981> but it REALLY matters for IGPUs
[15:27:03] <KatrinValerie> The use case being having way too many applications opened simulatiously so you dont have to wait for them to start
[15:27:26] <Bco1981> compiling faster, rendering faster
[15:27:33] <lastonestanding> thanks to the free slot you can easily upgrate this PC
[15:27:36] <Bco1981> more fps in games
[15:27:37] <lastonestanding> upgrade
[15:27:53] <lastonestanding> it's not a high end system
[15:27:54] <KatrinValerie> well, ram is pretty expensive right now I think
[15:28:02] <KatrinValerie> Pretty much all silicone chips are pricey right now
[15:28:08] <lastonestanding> but it's pretty decent for that price I think
[15:28:21] <Bco1981> true
[15:28:24] <lastonestanding> ‚Ç¨ 749,00
[15:28:30] <Bco1981> but has potintial for a nice upgrade
[15:28:40] <KatrinValerie> Dunno how bad it is, only know cause my girlfriend complained that some chips were like 200% more expensive than before the pandemic or something
[15:29:00] <KatrinValerie> She's the hw girl, me only know software
[15:29:16] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: i doubt 200% can even cut it now

[15:30:21] <lastonestanding> the same HP pc with a 5700G (eight cores) cost 100 bucks more

[15:30:39] <Bco1981> only if you are gonna use it for multicore things
[15:30:44] <Bco1981> if just gaming... no
[15:31:01] <lastonestanding> games use multiple cores too
[15:31:15] <Bco1981> mor ethen 6cores is a waste on games
[15:31:19] <Bco1981> is still valid
[15:31:35] <lastonestanding> the system will be used for several years
[15:31:53] <lastonestanding> think 3 or 4 years from now
[15:33:43] <Bco1981> personally i doubt we will see games that will use more then 6cores with in the next 3 years. it's hard to multihread a game.

[15:58:21] <Sadale> The current situation of China and Taiwan (province of China) is a bit complicated. There's a formal signed agreeement between the two places tho. Formally speaking, they both agree that there's just one China. But there're two interpretation of China.

[17:40:20] <Sadale> ah. I remember the context of this one.
[17:40:26] <Sadale> It's for USB harddrive data transfer
[17:40:46] <KatrinValerie> Lolicon content is problematic, for one thing it is legally questionable in many regions of the world including democracies
[17:41:17] <Roey> hey do you think it'll get caught by Apple's new image scanning technology
[17:41:23] <Roey> scanning/surveillance
[17:41:24] <KatrinValerie> And it often depicts sexual reltionships with minors in a favourable manner, which some people might use to justify their actions to themselves.
[17:41:40] <Roey> they're going to scan peoples' iClouds
[17:41:53] <Roey> KatrinValerie: aye, 100% this.
[17:41:55] <Sadale> The apple's scanning technology's scary. I'm cool with it scanning on the cloud.
[17:41:57] <KatrinValerie> Oh boy
[17:42:01] <Sadale> But I'm totally not cool with it scanning offline
[17:42:10] <KatrinValerie> I wonder what they are actually doing there
[17:42:30] <Roey> Sadale: it starts with one thing but then it spreads to other things.  Who knows, maybe Apple in China will have to scan for mentions of democracy or people associating with specific others
[17:42:30] <KatrinValerie> like are they only looking for known stuff like with copyright filters?
[17:42:44] <KatrinValerie> Still, it is a huge privacy concern and the potential of abuse is limitless
[17:42:46] <Roey> KatrinValerie: they are partnering with child protection groups
[17:43:03] <KatrinValerie> Roey: these groups do nothing to protect children though
[17:43:08] <Sadale> Roey, in China people are used to that. But I'm surprised that this thing got implemented in western world.
[17:43:09] <Roey> to look for known victims of child sexual abuse
[17:43:13] <KatrinValerie> it is all about demonstrating action
[17:43:15] <KatrinValerie> symbolism
[17:43:26] <KatrinValerie> But nothing to actually improve the situation of real existing living children
[17:43:27] <Sadale> And it's totally cool if it's just done in China because it's actually part of the culture.
[17:43:35] <Roey> Sadale: point is, it's an American company helping China to enforce totalitarianism
[17:43:38] <Roey> *it would be
[17:43:50] <Roey> <KatrinValerie> it is all about demonstrating action <- "theater", aye.
[17:43:59] <Sadale> You're assume that there's something wrong with China's way of handling things.
[17:44:07] <Sadale> I'd just say that the culture's just different.
[17:44:10] <KatrinValerie> Though I understand why people would want these images gone forever
[17:44:16] <Roey> Sadale: I do, yes, they're a dictatorship 
[17:44:23] <KatrinValerie> I mean, it makes sense to scan for this stuff on upload
[17:44:25] <Sadale> Roey, I'm Chinese.
[17:44:31] <Roey> Sadale: the Chinese Communist Party is a dictatorship
[17:44:49] <Sadale> There's nothing wrong with that at all because the party's doing well on driving the economy.
[17:45:09] <Roey> Sadale: they also disappear dissenters
[17:45:19] <Roey> they also commit genocide against Uighur citizens
[17:45:28] <Roey> there's lots of things wrong with the CCP.
[17:45:46] <Sadale> The US has rasicm issue as well.
[17:45:52] <Sadale> And it was never solved.
[17:46:06] <KatrinValerie> Let chinese people adress chinese problems I would say
[17:46:16] <KatrinValerie> They are the only people who can really change a thing about it anyways
[17:46:17] <Roey> Sadale: really? I see Blacks can vote
[17:46:29] <Roey> Sadale: I see that there are no more white-only/black-only water fountains
[17:46:36] <Sadale> Anyway I still find it funny how this kind of thing get implemented in western world. Offline scanning.
[17:46:39] <KatrinValerie> Roey: The republicans put in a lot of effort to reduce the number of black voters though.
[17:46:42] <Roey> Sadale: the institutionalized racism was pretty much solved
[17:46:54] <Roey> KatrinValerie: I don't see that at all, actually.
[17:47:02] <KatrinValerie> Roey: Voter supression?
[17:47:03] <Roey> KatrinValerie: let's remember it was the Democrats who fought for slavery,
[17:47:12] <Roey> KatrinValerie: and it's the Democrats who fought against civil rights
[17:47:18] <isekaijin> Sadale: ‚ÄúIf you have the technology, then why not use it?‚Äù That seems to be the main reason behind it.
[17:47:24] <Sadale> isekaijin, sad
[17:47:26] * hassoon spears isekaijin 
[17:47:29] <Roey> KatrinValerie: what do you call "voter suppression"? needing to show an ID to vote?
[17:47:38] <KatrinValerie> I mean you cannot argue the fact that the GOP pushed for changes to the election system that specifically make it harder for black communities to vote
[17:47:52] <Sadale> isekaijin, And if there's enough people using it other people who don't quite want to use it would eventually be forced to use it
[17:47:54] <Roey> in this past election?  No, I do not see that.
[17:48:07] <KatrinValerie> Such as moving the places where they can vote, shifting times of when they can vote to times specific to relgious events of certain groups
[17:48:15] <Roey> if anything, the GOP got Black Americans their best unemployment figures in the history of the country
[17:48:19] <Roey> with the past administration
[17:48:29] <hassoon> what is gop
[17:48:32] <Sadale> The wage tho
[17:48:53] <Roey> <KatrinValerie> Such as moving the places where they can vote, shifting times of when they can vote to times specific to relgious events of certain gr <- nope, because then Jews would be affected and would be complaining (but there's no complaints so far..)
[17:48:54] <KatrinValerie> Roey: So you are saying all reports about voter supression are a hoax?
[17:49:11] <Roey> KatrinValerie: depends on what you call "voter suppression", and i don't really see many reports about it
[17:49:24] <Roey> in contrast,
[17:49:38] <Roey> I see stuff like Democrats pushing Critical Race Theory on schools
[17:49:46] <KatrinValerie> Roey: there were policy changes all over the place that made it harder for people to register to vote and these policies specifically targeted black communities
[17:49:47] <Roey> and cozying up with the CCP
[17:49:52] <KatrinValerie> lol
[17:50:07] <KatrinValerie> CRT is an academic subject that is certainly not taught in HS
[17:50:20] <Roey> LOL are you kidding me?  Kids complain to their parents about it
[17:50:26] <Roey> that's partly how parents know that it is being taught
[17:50:29] <Sadale> Just because people could vote doesn't mean that people would vote the "right" person. I find it hillarious that Trump got elected as a president.
[17:50:43] <isekaijin> Roey: On the other hand, the US does not have to deal with separatism-motivated riots and even outright terrorists attacks by American Blacks (see: 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, 2013 Tian'anmen square attack, etc.), so the situation is very different.
[17:51:07] <KatrinValerie> Roey: kids views are shaped by their parents views when they are young, obviously they will report when something they learn at school conflicts with the values they are taught at home.
[17:51:40] <Roey> KatrinValerie: when kids are divided by race in class into groups andp lay pretend based on their race,
[17:51:41] <KatrinValerie> If you are afraid of that kind of influence you are a failure as a parent anyways
[17:51:53] <KatrinValerie> Because it is your responsibility to give your kids a proper moral compass
[17:52:01] <Roey> KatrinValerie: when kids are asked to fill out questionnaires about their parents' voting patterns,
[17:52:08] <Roey> that's some seriously sick stuff.
[17:52:25] <KatrinValerie> I know about these things you are telling me 
[17:52:31] <KatrinValerie> from reports on what fake news are being spread
[17:52:32] <Roey> yet you blame the parents
[17:52:33] <Roey> I see.
[17:52:53] <Roey> you should see some more news besides CNN and MSNBC
[17:53:03] <Roey> and New York Times
[17:53:08] <KatrinValerie> I don't watch either of these
[17:53:16] <Roey> yet you subscribe to their ideologies
[17:53:25] <Roey> and you reflect the kind of drivel that they put out as news
[17:53:27] <KatrinValerie> I consult sources across different politcal spectrums and try to fact check stuff
[17:53:34] <KatrinValerie> Look into sources for claims
[17:53:40] <Roey> your fact checking smells a little off
[17:53:52] <Roey> where do you go, snopes? lol
[17:53:54] <KatrinValerie> and times and times again the outrage about SJW culture turns out to be about literally nothing at all.
[17:54:03] <Roey> anyway,
[17:54:10] <Roey> yeah the riots last year
[17:54:13] <Roey> they were nothing at all either
[17:54:26] <Roey> nevermind they were BLM-supporters who set fire to Black-owned businesses
[17:54:34] <Roey> collatoral damage, yeah? 
[17:54:46] <KatrinValerie> You are already assuming I am pro rioting

[18:14:51] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: tbh that sounds like a made up reason
[18:15:29] <KatrinValerie> it would make much more sense that it was banned because of the trans character, as that's kinda illegal in russia along with homosexuality.
[18:16:10] <KatrinValerie> kinda because the situation is more complicated than a straight up blanket ban from all I know and I know way too little about russian internal affairs

[18:19:33] <amigojapan> Slime and konosuba were banned too

[19:16:35] <KatrinValerie> I think spreading CTs is against libera terms, but I would have to reread the rules to tell you which exact paragraph of the rules that would violate.
[19:18:30] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: to be a voice of reason. But I wood allow people that believe it to join
[19:18:44] <amigojapan> Would
[19:21:52] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think there are very few flat earthers on IRC, or at least I like to think that.
[19:22:10] <KatrinValerie> Though often you cannot convince these people otherwise anyways.
[19:22:31] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: your are wrong, there are even several in this channel
[19:22:33] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: CTs basically are a modern form of proto-religion.
[19:22:41] <KatrinValerie> oof
[19:23:01] <amigojapan> That does CT stand for?
[19:23:12] <KatrinValerie> Oh sorry, Conspiracy Theories
[19:23:17] <amigojapan> Ah
[19:24:11] <amigojapan> I don't know. I believe in one kind of conspiracy but not in flat earth. I don't believe in "history"
[19:24:47] <KatrinValerie> I think some of these people you may be able to reason with, but you have to understand that you are arguing against religous dogma
[19:25:29] <KatrinValerie> The fact that their in-group is relatively small can be used as leverage, but that can backfire and lead to complete isolation from circles that do not believe in their conspiracy theroy of choice.
[19:26:02] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: You can point out the negative social consequences which is much more convincing to most people than actual factual arguments that they cannot follow anyways.
[19:26:13] <amigojapan> I don't think I can convince them
[19:26:15] <KatrinValerie> You fall for conspiracy theories because of a massive lack of knowledge.
[19:26:35] <KatrinValerie> Filling that knowledge vacuum takes a lot of time.
[19:26:50] <amigojapan> There are some true conspiracies
[19:27:21] <KatrinValerie> Yes there are, but that is not what we mean when we talk about conspiracy theories anyways
[19:27:46] <amigojapan> Ok
[19:27:49] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: and there is never a group of people that investigates and finds out about a real conspiracy, in reality conspiracies are found out because of leaks or whistleblowers.
[19:28:13] <amigojapan> Or are never found out
[19:28:31] <KatrinValerie> I think only small conspiracies manage to never be found out
[19:28:45] <KatrinValerie> the fewer people involved, the better your chances to keep it a secret.
[19:29:29] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: things like Japan teaching that there was no such thing as forcing Koreans into prostitution is a real conspiracy
[19:31:24] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: why would you believe in such a just world? This world is not just
[19:31:43] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: we have the same thing happening in Germany to an extent, but I think that is mostly because if we were to cover all WW2 crimes in history classes, we could only teach about WW2.
[19:32:02] <MootPoot> what about the sex part
[19:33:14] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Do the textbooks simply not cover it, or deny that it ever happened? If they just ommit it I do not think it was neccessarily intentionally.

[19:34:06] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I am not sure. I don't have access to text books, but I know young people don't know about it
[19:36:40] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I know of young people that do not know about the pink list
[19:37:00] <KatrinValerie> Or that the nazis also slaughtered those with disabilities
[19:37:41] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: but I also know that a lot of kids simply do not listen to what is taught in school because of what they learn at home.
[19:38:16] <KatrinValerie> When I went to HS, WW2 history classes were more than enough to display the horrors of the nazi era
[19:38:38] <KatrinValerie> Yet some of the kids I went to school with developed into neonazis
[19:39:51] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I don't think neonazies are as scary as the real thing
[19:40:38] <amigojapan> I don't think they can get away with similar things anymore
[19:42:31] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I hope so, but looking at the numbers here in Germany...
[19:42:44] <KatrinValerie> And the conservative party is moving a lot further to the right now
[19:42:59] <KatrinValerie> They have started to adopt trumpist like rhethroics
[19:43:25] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: so basically slandering the political opponent with lies is their current strategy for the federal elections
[19:44:50] <amigojapan> Yeah ok KatrinValerie but I don't think they will be capable of genocide
[19:45:06] <KatrinValerie> why'd you think so?
[19:45:33] <KatrinValerie> A lot of members of the far right party here are known to argue for a final solution and an ethno state.
[19:45:46] <KatrinValerie> Building an ethno state basically requires genocide
[19:46:45] <KatrinValerie> And all possible new coalitions would likely need 3 political parties :/
[19:46:49] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: they are probably just being eddgy
[19:46:49] <KatrinValerie> The situation is generally not good
[19:47:03] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: No, they are very serious about it.
[19:47:23] <KatrinValerie> Their actions in the so called "national liberation zones" speak for themselves
[19:47:53] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: we have had right wing terrorism in Germany for a long time now, even politicans have been killed.
[19:48:25] <KatrinValerie> There's been attacks on left leaning party offices as well
[19:48:32] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie . Maybe I have been too calm

[19:50:12] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: a number of state polices have been connected to right wing networks that prepare for violently overthrowing the government
[19:51:08] <KatrinValerie> the militant left has bricks and maybe they know how to build molotov cocktails, they are nowhere near as organsied as their right-wing counterparts.
[19:51:22] <KatrinValerie> Not that I would want either side to have a say.
[19:51:48] <amigojapan> I see
[19:51:59] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: We live in troubled times really, there are lots of parallels to the 20ies of the last century
[19:52:37] <KatrinValerie> Democracies do not have a strong standing in the world.

[19:59:09] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: There has also been a massive backlash against LGBTQ rights, with many states outlawing all gender affirming care for trans youth.  
[19:59:44] <KatrinValerie> And the GOP did a lot of damage to democratic institutions through gerrymandering and other sheniganis they used for voter supression
[20:00:30] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: voter repression mostly works through setting the bars for voting too high for lower class people and PoC specifically.
[20:00:52] <KatrinValerie> Like requiring a birth certificate to register, which many poor americans do not have.

[20:28:47] <rando25892> it pretty low level im thikn stuff like gegl and babl
[20:28:59] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Nothing wrong with being a hentai.
[20:29:23] <rando25892> ofc in automating but i have no use case just thought it now
[20:29:36] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: because the education on political systems in Germany is actually pretty good and shortcomings of our own political system are adressed in classes.
[20:29:39] <rando25892> import quality is pretty good at first take
[20:29:40] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I don't want to get involved with hentais
[20:30:22] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: bah you just buy your things you grew up listening to
[20:30:24] <klaxa> KatrinValerie: anecdotal evidence, also as a teen you don't give a crap about politics
[20:30:42] <klaxa> in general education is fucked pretty much all over the place in most countries in the world
[20:30:47] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: not really, I reevaluate my stance on stuff and I am far from mainstream in certain topics
[20:31:28] <klaxa> but that's thanks to the recent pressure of the capitalist system and the ancient pressure of the catholic system
[20:31:31] <KatrinValerie> klaxa: I guess I wasn't your usual teen then, I did care about politics very early on
[20:31:40] <klaxa> yeah, but look at your peers
[20:31:44] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: but you think democracy offers a solution to problems
[20:31:47] <pystardust> amigojapan: yes I am
[20:31:48] <KatrinValerie> Yeah the eduction system in total is bad
[20:31:50] <klaxa> how many were into politics as well? maybe 2?
[20:31:58] <KatrinValerie> but the content they try to teach isn't all bad
[20:32:12] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I think democracy is a certain form of government

[20:33:38] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: you think there is a "correct"type of government
[20:33:39] <klaxa> the content may not be the worst, but the strict way of teaching everyone at the same pace is retarded
[20:33:46] <KatrinValerie> regular public school
[20:33:51] <klaxa> 50% are bored, 50% fall behind
[20:33:58] <KatrinValerie> bbl got to do some chores
[20:34:05] <amigojapan> Ok
[20:35:50] <isekaijin> klaxa: Worst of all, school does not even teach actual values like the importance of hard work, since the two easiest ways of getting by as a high schooler are being a genius (and for high school standards this is not very difficult) and being an ass kisser.
[20:35:58] <amigojapan> !later tell KatrinValerie if the USA is crumbling it would be cause democracy was a false ideal

[20:37:43] <isekaijin> Whoa, whoa, are my eyes deceiving me? Has ##anime become a place for the socialist scum of the Earth?
[20:37:43] <klaxa> given the amount of dosh involved it's an obvious oligarchy
[20:38:26] <klaxa> it's so funny, that whenever you point out shortcomings of capitalism, you are immediately a commie

[20:38:41] <rando25892> there is also the natural zones that is a theory where it creates different cultures and its those differences that seperate them good example is africa

[20:42:43] <Sadale> lol you know what? It's socialist.
[20:43:27] <amigojapan> Sadale: then why are there poor people? Why is earning money so important?
[20:44:04] <Sadale> actually the official wordings is like socialist with Chinese feature or something. I'm not sure on what it's called in English. I don't think they call it capitalism tho

[20:48:09] <klaxa> make the workplace democratic, it's the biggest hierarchical structure
[20:48:10] <isekaijin> amigojapan: None of the ‚Äúgiving free shits to the poor‚Äù crap that the left loves and is not sustainable in the long term.

[21:05:39] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I was not in Japan yet
[21:06:51] <Bco1981> amigojapan: yeah that's what i remember aswell... it was just that Hololive Aqua says in a clip, that she remembers a trauma of being left "behind" by her friends because she didn't have one... at the time they were popular...
[21:07:00] <amigojapan> Bco1981: they are still selling new tamagocchi now. Which are colour
[21:07:06] <Bco1981> that would make her, quite a bit older then "17"

[21:11:51] <amigojapan> "It was released by Bandai on¬†November 23, 1996, in Japan and on May 1, 1997, in the rest of the world, quickly becoming one of the biggest toy fads of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. As of 2010, over 76 million Tamagotchis had been sold worldwide." Bco1981

[23:33:52] <Jigsy> They introduced some kind of SASL thing.
[23:33:54] <JesseDesu> i thought it was 60k
[23:34:01] <Jigsy> So even netsplit doesn't count it anymore.

[23:34:56] <Jigsy> They plan to reboot the servers this month.
[23:35:01] <Jigsy> So that'll kill the numbers even futher.

[23:35:05] <Jigsy> :D
[23:35:17] <MootPoot> Said something about #anime being the true/real anime 
[23:35:31] <MootPoot> Then bailed
[23:35:59] <JesseDesu> to bail means to jump out of an airplane
[23:36:02] <JesseDesu> right
[23:36:07] <MootPoot> Now I'm pretty sure he just sits and logs this channel for some far flung future plan
[23:36:07] <emmeka> anyone actually over there still? I haven't popped into Freenode to see what's been happening since they killed all registrations
[23:36:25] <Jigsy> I don't use freenode either.

[23:36:28] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: satin was last seen in #anime 2 months and 22 days ago: <Satin> network issue huh, good luck o.o
[23:36:34] * MootPoot sighs
[23:36:37] <Jigsy> But you need to register with some kind of non-functional webplatform to use it now.
