[09:04:09] <FromGitter> <opie4624> I know that within `dotspacemacs-additional-packages` I can make it clone a git repo where the package lives and load from there. Is there a similar mechanism for layers? Can I load a layer from a specified git repo?
[10:02:45] <FromGitter> <michael-nhat> Have nice day everybody! Could someone please help me write a function search a string with evil mode. ‚èé For example: when call my-evil-search-string, it auto highlight all the match, then jump to next occurence ‚èé (just like when I press / then type that string then press enter, then type n.) ‚èé I couldn't find way to do this in elisp, evil-search module seem hard to understand for me! ‚èé I found this

[17:38:23] <FromGitter> <lainon_:matrix.org> Anyone have any trouble loading fonts using WSL?
[17:39:02] <FromGitter> <lainon_:matrix.org> I've installed Source Code Pro, but I keep getting a warning on startup saying it cant find the font
[20:23:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > @dalanicolai  so a few days ago, fresh to emacs. I set something to `f` thinking that meant false instead of commenting it out. Fixing that solved my problem. I discovered it in debug mode. Thank you for the suggestion ‚èé  ‚èé üëç
[20:29:43] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Yeah that's annoying. I don't know what the `timeout` variable does, but next time I think you can 'bypass' the issue by customizing the variable `package-archives`. It would be nice if someone could come up with an idea for how to prevent this. It shouldn't be that hard I guess...
[20:32:59] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I think they come with the all-the-icons (https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el) package. I am not aware of easy ways to customize the icons. I guess you should create your own icons, and your own 'overriding' `all-the-icons-...-alist`s
[20:34:16] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have once done such thing for my mediator package (https://github.com/dalanicolai/mediator), but I don't remember too well what I did.
[20:35:37] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But if you learn some elisp, learn how to use the 'describe' functions and the debugger, then it is really not so hard to find out how to create your own theme (if you insist)
[20:57:29] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I don't think that is possible. Just clone it manually to your `.emacs.d/private` directory
