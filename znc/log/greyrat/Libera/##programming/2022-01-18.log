[00:21:44] <kveroneau> You can embed the Lua/Python/JavaScript languages in C programs pretty easily, and override their default file handling routines to have a working language inside your mini-OS running in userland.
[00:22:13] <ProfSimm> kveroneau: I'm thinking of shaping up the language and embedding it in a "killer app"

[00:25:14] <kveroneau> nomagno, yes, but if those components are written in a way which they can be replaced, then the initial development can be started in the safety of a host OS, and once the foundation is ready, then a proper kernel could then be written, and these embedded languages can then be updated so that their APIs hit the new kernel being written for it's file system calls.
[00:26:55] <kveroneau> I feel that a lot of OS devs just jump at trying to make something that boots via the MBR/EFI/GRUB straight out of the gate, then when it comes to building userland programs, or building anything useful inside their newly booted OS, there comes the problems on creating a nice build and test pipeline.

[00:28:27] <kveroneau> This allows the initial userland programs, init-system, shell, and various potential debug tools to be built and the kernel's API to be finalized in this initial process.
[00:28:59] <ProfSimm> kveroneau: I agree with you, you can build a meta-platform first. This is literally how most startups start. They use cloud services, before they decide to buy themselves a datacenter
[00:29:43] <ProfSimm> A new OS has no chance of picking up, unless a new class of devices demands it
[00:29:59] <ProfSimm> It has to be disrupted from within. As an app.
[00:30:00] <kveroneau> Then the userland program initially used for development could be used a light base for the new kernel code, where all the Host OS calls are then rewritten from scratch to instead call the BIOS or EFI and talk to the hardware directly.
[00:30:55] <kveroneau> A meta-platform is a good word for it. :)
[00:31:53] <ProfSimm> Zuckerberg entered the chat
[00:32:32] <kveroneau> Nowadays, namely due to how the Linux kernel is licensed, I'd just use the Linux kernel as the Kernel, as it already has a lot of driver support.  Google did that with Android afterall.
[00:33:00] <ProfSimm> It depends if one's goals are academic/idealistic or monetary.
[00:33:07] <ProfSimm> Google just wanted some stuff out there.
[00:33:20] <ProfSimm> I personally am a hopeless idealist.
[00:33:25] <kveroneau> Android is by no means compatible with that many traditional Linux apps, and it's not a platform where you really run Linux apps.  It may boot like Linux at first, but after it's up, it's really no longer Linux.
[00:33:42] <ProfSimm> Linux is no longer the light thing it used to be.
[00:33:54] <ProfSimm> But of course it can be a step towards a standalone OS
[00:34:09] <kveroneau> That's the good part about the kernel, you can easily recompile it and take out all the stuff you don't need. :)
[00:35:02] <flakland> it sounds good on paper, until you start lobbing off the drivers/modules in the kernel config
[00:35:04] <kveroneau> And what you could do, if you could write new VFS drivers to replace say procfs and the traditional file system layers with code that talks to a relational database living RAWly on a disk partition.

[01:22:33] <kveroneau> Hmm, no I haven't actually.
[01:22:35] <tforever> 6502 assembly is sweet. it's explicit that it was designed to be written by humans unlike x86
[01:22:39] <wuldor2> Is C++ actually a better choice than C or is it just industry group think?
[01:22:55] <tforever> x86 assembly is meant for compilers
[01:23:45] <kveroneau> tforever, that's why I loved 6502 so much and choose it and it's assembly for this online hacking game, as players could easily build their own programs with or without a C compiler.
[01:23:52] <tforever> wuldor2: depends. if you want to involve in a huge commercial project and want codebase to be easily maintained, oop is handful

[01:26:04] <tforever> deniska: yes, you are right. but it was involved in a way that makes a human to struggle. but it had to, it's being used in a wide ranges and different fields of computing; from supercomputers to home PCs
[01:26:13] <inhahe_> i've looked into games where you make programs fight with each other before, maybe i've seen yours
[01:26:24] <inhahe_> many years ago
[01:26:28] <nomagno> So you're not going to make an OS in the traditional sense of the word (maybe with an embedded forth or something, not impossible!), but it's rather fit for one-off microcontroller-like programmers
[01:26:48] <kveroneau> It was going to be a fully hackable virtual system.  While it could run many 6502 VMs, I was struggling with getting the virtual networking to work, so development slowed down, until I just lost interest.
[01:27:41] <kveroneau> I was thinking of revitialing it at one point using Docker containers to house each player's virtual 6502, and then use Docker's virtual networking abilities to simulate the in-game network that way.  But never started on that version.
[01:28:17] <nomagno> kveroneau: That would have likely been a huuuge overhead
[01:28:41] <kveroneau> That's what I was thinking, as the player-base grew, so would the amount of docker containers...

[01:29:03] <kveroneau> And since it was written in Python, and Python isn't exactly light on memory, it would have been a lot of resources.
[01:29:06] <wuldor2> Not sure if oop is an arguement for C++? You can encapsulate like that in C, it just seems to be a bit of syntactic sugar. The only thing I have seen in my naivity that mainly seperates C++ ideas is the use of templates and I can't in my limited scope see how those are all that useful, maybe for industrial work it makes sense or am I just naive?
[01:29:12] <nomagno> The point of docker containers is isolating stuff that isn't isolated by default
[01:29:24] <nomagno> a 6502 VM is isolated by definition
[01:30:01] <kveroneau> My latest codebase had the server software seperated into "microservices", so one 6502 per container wouldn't have been entirely possible without a huge rewrite.

[03:48:33] <Decker> ProfSimm actually the big bang is one of them; at one point over the past 2 years I heard/saw someone explain space/time curvature as a rotation of space over time... and sorta that works (but not at all) - if you consider the forward velocity of the thing as a 'thing' that can be maybe rotated over time, depending on distance to something else
[03:49:18] <Decker> ProfSimm but the curvature only applies for elliptical orbits (and then not very well) where there's a smoother change in angles over time, but for the linear distortion of space to be the way it is, it's not a rotation.

[03:50:23] <Decker> ProfSimm so I gave up that space is flat, and allowed gravity to curve space; after spending a good week pitcutring what exactly a reimannian curved closed, surface would end up being.. and found if I zoomed to 0,0,0 and inserted 'i' there so that 0 was no longer actually there, then a lot of things worked out
[03:50:32] <ProfSimm> Decker: I'm literally trying to dumb down what you say for myself so I understand it
[03:50:40] <Decker> but then that ends up being counter ot the big bang theory ( some catholic guy came up with it)

[03:58:49] <ProfSimm> Decker: "The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age."

[04:10:43] <flakland> makes sense
[04:11:27] <kveroneau> It's a lot of really complex code, as you can see.  It has a lot of moving parts.  And me being the sole developer, upgrading this beast wouldn't be easy.
[04:11:58] <flakland> it's always interesting when a gigantic project suddenly changes drastically, or begins exhibiting abnormal behavior. like C is trying to get destructors now
[04:12:29] <nomagno> kveroneau: Semver exists for a reason though
[04:12:35] <kveroneau> I guess that's why I have so much respect for FreePascal and it's amazing backwards compatibility.  I can literally compile code from TurboPascal 4.0 in modern FreePascal.
[04:13:16] <epony> Pascal was a fine mathematician.
[04:13:21] <nomagno> Python3 should be assumed to not need to keep backwards compatibility with Python2 any more than they consider. If it was Python2.8, then they wouldn't be able to break backwards compatibility.
[04:13:36] <BauComeTeuCu> lol @ FreePascal
[04:13:37] <kveroneau> flakland, ObjectPascal has always had destructors...  C++ has destructors, right?

[04:16:36] <BauComeTeuCu> but it was a good breaking change because code that relied on the defects was defective too
[04:16:53] <kveroneau> Ah, so that makes sense.
[04:17:40] <kveroneau> Python 3 made some huge changes, although for the better, Python 2 should have just been progressive when it was developed and had better support in the first place. *cough* unicode *cough*

[06:16:57] <CoJaBo> Our sole GIS dev abruptly died, and I suddenly inherited all their projects
[06:17:09] <norias> oh.
[06:17:18] <norias> somehow GIS just doesn't interest me
[06:17:30] <norias> I'd do games just because of the overlap with stuff i want to do
[06:17:51] <wuldor2> what are you applying it to?
[06:18:05] <CoJaBo> My first few dozen hours doing it sucked a lot
[06:18:20] <wuldor2> Games for me are just a way of getting ideas out, mapping idea space.

[06:20:08] <norias> there are a few interesting problems out there
[06:20:22] <norias> i'm mostly interested in the CAM side and how the CAD affects it
[06:20:36] <norias> mostly with machined articles
[06:21:25] <norias> specifically, i want to make some things that increase productivity of people that program CNC machines
[06:21:32] <norias> at least, in the near term
[06:21:53] <norias> there's a lot of work that needs done with the way data is moved around in machining
[06:22:05] <norias> (and machining is the backbone of a lot of manufacturing)
[06:22:35] <norias> specifically, we aren't commonly associating tolerance data in the product definition files
[06:22:47] <norias> step can do it
[06:23:03] <norias> but then we have an issue where there isn't really a good mathematical description of tolerances

[07:42:55] <jackson99> hi guys
[07:43:08] <jackson99> any tips on using sagulator to estimate how thick of a shelf I need for my programming PC? :). I don't think I understand what the numbers mean. for example, I entered melamine (particleboard), 60cm span (24"), 20cm depth (8") and 12mm thickness (1/2"), floating, uniform load, and it is already borderline at 1.6kg (3.5 lbs). but in this video, the guy is loading board of similar dimensions, with mostly central load, to 186 kg or 410 lbs
[07:43:15] <jackson99> https://youtu.be/8jESD2-lv-M?t=145
[07:43:16] <bayaz> Title: Ikea Board Vs. Real Wood! Which is Stronger? Hydraulic Press Test! 
[07:43:18] <jackson99> that is ONE HUNDRED TIMES more than the number sagulator gives. what the hell??
[07:46:58] <jackson99> https://woodbin.com/calcs/sagulator/
[07:46:59] <bayaz> Title: The Sagulator ? WoodBin 
[07:48:04] <PlanckWalk> Sagulator doesn't seem too far off there
[07:48:22] <PlanckWalk> 100 mm sag looks not terribly different from the video just before it breaks.
[07:48:42] <PlanckWalk> (It obviously says "EXCESSIVE")
[07:49:16] <jackson99> what is excessive? it broke at two orders of magnitude more than their estimate
[07:49:25] <jackson99> is it using safety factor of > 100x ?
[07:49:25] <PlanckWalk> More than their estimate for what?
[07:50:20] <PlanckWalk> It calls something "excessive" if the sag is more than a couple of millimetres per metre
[07:50:37] <PlanckWalk> Which is reasonable in a lot of cases
[07:51:08] <PlanckWalk> If you accept more sag than that, then ignore its red EXCESSIVE description.
[07:51:57] <jackson99> I don't care about sag, I care about "will it break". which should also depend on the material, no?
[07:52:09] *** Quits: wuldor2 (~daddy@84.71.242.153) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:52:10] <jackson99> it seems like sagulator is completely worthless for this?
[07:52:14] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't calculate whether it will break
[07:52:20] <PlanckWalk> It's sagulator, not breakulator.
[07:53:16] <jackson99> so you're telling me it is for people who just care about visual sag of a shelf, not about strength of a shelf
[07:53:40] <PlanckWalk> It's not just visual
[07:53:48] <jackson99> 2mm per m sag, regardless of material type, or anything else. I'm obviously no expert, but that seems completely useless criteria
[07:54:00] <jackson99> +like a
[07:54:06] <PlanckWalk> If you're designing a bokcase or something, sag can also affect rigidity and structural stability.

[11:08:59] <PlanckWalk> We've got pretty darn good evidence (and enormous amounts of it) for something very much like QM being true.
[11:09:35] <amigojapan> PlanckWalk: QM does predict some behaviour pretty well
[11:09:35] <PlanckWalk> Even if the details are wrong, it has to be far enough out in that direction from our intuitive understanding, that those observations exist.
[11:10:23] <inhahe_> amigojapan: it's more intuitive to me that reality would be maximally full than arbitrarily limited, e.g. to one universe that has the pattern it has for no particular reason
[11:10:29] <amigojapan> PlanckWalk: I am taking against the many worlds theory not QM
[11:10:48] <PlanckWalk> amigojapan: As I said, the more modern view is decoherence

[16:02:25] <arahael> Hey, lets (try to be) civil here!
[16:03:52] <pyzozord> tomathy: no, nodejs is js engine (v8) + eventloop + libraries to make it as similar to browser js envionrment as reasonable
[16:04:21] <tomathy> ppl hate java and js because they make it easy for non programers to get by?
[16:04:47] <tomathy> ok
[16:04:51] <mrig> I found JS really difficult personally.
[16:04:51] <arahael> tomathy: Frankly, it's a combination of the different camps between static, type-checked compiled languages, vs that of a completely loose dynamic language.  People have strong preferences, however given that JS, for all practical purposes, is the only real option for browsers (guys, I'm generalising, ok?), people sometimes feel annoyed and upset about it and call it a 'cancer' because it is
[16:04:52] <arahael> the only choice, therefore, it's the language that gets used, so it's taking over.
[16:05:08] <mrig> Am finally now somewhere that it is starting to make sense though.
[16:05:31] <mrig> c in the terminal was superb for starting though.

[16:07:32] <mrig> oh you do love your haskell :D
[16:07:56] <seq2seqbot> Javascript is almost as adopted as Klingon as far as languages go
[16:08:37] <Trieste> The thing that always bugged me was that IIRC Python *almost* was the in-browser language
[16:08:43] <mrig> I did here an interesting talk about monads that was using JS as its example of there existence and use.
[16:08:57] <mrig> I think this is what I found difficult about JS initially.
[16:08:57] <arahael> Trieste: You sure about that? I don't think it ever was.
[16:09:04] <Trieste> (Then again, it's hard to imagine what would become of Python had it received JS kind of attention)

[19:05:34] <horseface> i mean how stupid...
[19:05:50] <jackson99> I got this microsoft ergonomic keyboard, mouse, numpad for just $60 on amazon.de (price went up a bit since then). https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Desktop-Keyboard-L5V-00002/dp/B00DUV01SC/
[19:05:56] <horseface> i am simply wishing to examine the code and establish its operation in my mind, etc.
[19:05:57] <horseface> :-)
[19:06:01] <jackson99> initial impressions are quite good! keyboard is excellent, and mouse is at least as good as my logitech mx vertical, that I paid twice as much as this entire set
[19:06:20] <euouae> One project I contributed bugfixes, and I was berated a lot about the format of my PRs, and silly stuff about performance (I did not want to be rude so I pretended to agree)
[19:07:00] <rindolf> jackson99: i like ms' mice too
[19:07:05] <euouae> Then in one PR I was asked to go way beyond the original goal of a bugfix into developing a feature (at least 5 different requests), which was GUI and was annoying, but I did after a lot of back and forth
[19:07:23] <euouae> and then I was told my code doesn't work and I was ignored! (my code worked)
[19:07:46] <euouae> In a security project I was berated for contributing some minor patches, and in another project I'm getting ignored right now

[20:20:39] <ESphynx> if ti is an eC source file in the same library, the eC precompiler (ecp) does a first pass at generating symbols for every source files. then the eC compiler (ecc) will look for the symbol files generated by that.
[20:20:57] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, who? microsoft?
[20:21:02] <sonny> ESphynx ok interesting, so your module approach means each modules is a file or directory basically?
[20:21:03] <[itchyjunk]> its just $65B
[20:21:09] <ESphynx> for librarries, you compile your library into a dynamically linked library, and the compiler will load it up to look for symbol definitions

[22:02:30] <sonny> use of octal is genius, but it took me a super long time to figure it out
[22:02:33] <EdFletcher> Jong: read the manpage. it explains the syntax. 
[22:03:02] <[itchyjunk]> i guess idk what "mode" is
[22:03:06] <Jong> GeDaMo  that makes it harder to copy and paste the permission settings of one file onto another in case someone wants another file to be like another
[22:03:12] <[itchyjunk]> so differeny permission is just different mode?
[22:03:13] <GeDaMo> "mode" means permissions in this case
[22:03:13] <oldlaptop> Most of the "file mode" bits have to do with permissions, but whether it's executable, and whether (if so) it executes using different permissions than the user executing it, are also controlled by the "file mode".

[22:03:43] <[itchyjunk]> some hidden thing with files that i never knew about

[22:05:22] <[itchyjunk]> file don't store the "modes" though
[22:05:31] <[itchyjunk]> "modes" gone does not imply files gone
[22:05:41] <[itchyjunk]> GeDaMo, so say i have a ubuntu on a laptop
[22:05:48] <oldlaptop> In UNIX filesystems, "file modes" are stored along with the files.
[22:05:49] <[itchyjunk]> then i live boot ubuntu and mount

[23:38:44] <[itchyjunk]> when 2 programs start talking to each other, you need a different metnal model altogether
[23:38:48] <GeDaMo> It interprets the messages it receives from clients and servers

[23:40:12] <mrig> I suppose I essentially believe that far better heuristics are possible, just not sure if the work is in the grammar or the naming of things; I suspect the latter and that that involves a context free grammar which equates to a protocol.

[23:41:56] <mrig> But that this is also mathematical in nature, this was why my attention was peeked by ProfSimm's reference to the calculus of a file system.

[23:43:06] <GeDaMo> A file system is a kind of database
[23:44:03] <mrig> oh yes like the dewey decimal system but far more intricate.
[23:44:04] <Decker> key value database even
[23:44:09] <Decker> barely

[23:44:27] <mrig> it is a key value pair database, so far as I'm aware.
[23:44:38] <GeDaMo> Nested key:value
[23:44:44] <Decker> all paths can be flattned to a flat name; the file api can track where your current directory is, and build parts
[23:44:46] <Decker> not even nested
[23:44:48] <Decker> just flat
[23:44:51] <mrig> was gobsmaked when the penny dropped on that one :)
[23:45:07] <Decker> okay sure it's nested in a hash table
[23:45:25] <mrig> in a trie is even better :)
[23:45:34] <GeDaMo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_MCP#File_system "However, since about 1970, MCP internally uses a 'FLAT' directory listing all file paths on a volume."

[23:47:03] <mrig> my main interest in another language is due to its ability in a trie.
[23:47:33] <mrig> just far less entropy.

[23:57:54] <Decker> I need things to test my object storage system with ( some objects might be directories that have meta-data (real data?) and an array of files (which all also have arrays that can contain files) but mostly they just have data (meta-data?)
[23:59:56] <mrig> Decker: there are 4000 lines of code that describe the context free grammar if you would like to take a look at them?
