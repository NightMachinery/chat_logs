[15:33:32] <wrycode> is there a builtin way to preview CairoMakie figures automatically or do I need to write a wrapper? 
[15:35:58] <wrycode> the tutorials and documentation seem to imply that figure will be shown when you run a function (like lines() or heatmap!()) but I only get a Scene object that I need to save in a file before opening
[15:37:41] <wrycode> Oh ok I found that GTK previewer on https://docs.juliahub.com/CairoMakie/9mSey/0.5.8/

[18:40:14] <wrycode> I can't get the latex examples from this page working: https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/documentation/latex/
[18:40:56] <wrycode> for instance, if I copy and paste the figure and axis definition from the first code block, I get a figure with normal strings instead of rendered latex
[18:41:35] <wrycode> I have LaTeXStrings and MathTeXEngine both imported
[18:53:36] <wrycode> minimal example: https://paste.mozilla.org/P2k8f3fd/raw and output: https://0x0.st/-RFK.pdf
[18:54:47] <wrycode> only thing I can think of right now is that I'm using a font that doesn't support LaTeX? any ideas?
[20:51:59] <wrycode> tried other verbatim examples from the Julia Data Science book too. I can't figure out why my LaTeX strings aren't rendering as latex
[21:42:55] <nagefire> wrycode: are you using the REPL, Atom, VSCode, Pluto, or IJulia?
[21:45:12] <wrycode> nagefire: REPL, or just running julia scripts. E.g. https://paste.mozilla.org/yr9peyaz/raw
[21:46:05] <wrycode> if I run julia tmp.jl from the shell, I get this pdf: https://0x0.st/-RFF.pdf
[22:20:49] <wrycode> Got it working! The problem was that I installed MakieTex a while ago, which I'm guessing was an early iteration of Makie's LaTeX support, and it was holding back my CairoMakie version.
[22:22:24] <wrycode> Okay, that only took me 4 hours
[23:14:53] <nagefire> wrycode: glad that you got it resolved
[23:15:11] <nagefire> wrycode: it helps to have different environments for different projects so you don't run into those problems
[23:16:30] <nagefire> wrycode: according to julia convention, your top-level environment should only include packages for debugging, testing, and profiling
[23:30:05] <wrycode> so a manifest.toml in my project directories basically
[23:50:53] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[23:55:47] <nagefire> don't modify the manifest directly, use `Pkg` instead
[23:56:26] <nagefire> For example, I have an environment named @graphs that contains a few packages for creating and plotting graphs
[23:56:54] <nagefire> You can create or use an environment by entering the REPL and typing "] activate [ENV_NAME]"
[23:57:22] <nagefire> You need to prepend an @ sign to the environment name
[23:58:04] <nagefire> My julia version is 1.6, so the "default" environment is @v1.6
