[09:21:25] <tabakhase> ksynwa "no" - recreating a new gen of a container should be daily business tho... check out docker-compose for the future ;-) maybe "rekcod" to get your run back, and "docker cp" if you havent made volume and are ybout to lose your data ;-)

[18:57:19] <blackwood821> Hi. Is there a way to configure two processes in supervisord.conf where one is a one-time install script that also starts a service (which is the second process defined in supervisord.conf). I set "autostart=false" on the second process since the first one starts the second one but then "autorestart=true" on the second one doesn't restart the second process... I'm guessing because supervisord didn't start is due to autostart=false

[19:04:25] <programmerq> blackwood821â–¸ check out autorestart vs autostart http://supervisord.org/configuration.html
[19:04:44] <programmerq> I would guess you want autostart=true and autorestart=false or autorestart=unexpected
[19:05:16] <blackwood821> programmerq: I read that documentation and for the first process I have autostart=true and autorestart=false which works well. For the second process I tried autostart=false (since the first process starts this process) and autorestart=true
[19:05:38] <blackwood821> But if I manually stop the second process supervisord doesn't restart it
[19:05:45] <blackwood821> Does it only restart process that have autostart=true?
[19:07:11] <programmerq> if you ask supervisord to stop a process, I would expect it to stay stopped. autorestart=true would kick in if the process exited on its own instead of supervisor stopping it.
[19:09:44] <blackwood821> Right, my second process is postgres and I manually stopped postgres without using supervisord but supervisord didn't start it back up automatically
[19:10:18] <blackwood821> So if autostart=false and autorestart=true is supervisord supposed to autorestart the process even though it didn't start it?
[19:11:49] <programmerq> did you start and stop it it outside supervisord?
[19:12:39] <programmerq> I think if you start it via supervisord, and then kill out outside supervisord, that autorestart=true should kick in. if you just fired up a postgres process outside supervisord altogether and killed it, then I wouldn't expect supervisord to do anything.

[19:41:40] <programmerq> it depends on the install method you might have used. if there's a file called 'docker-compose' somewhere on your disk, then it's installed. if you did an apt package, you would see it using apt tools. if you dropped in a binary, then you would only see the binary.

[20:04:53] <programmerq> yeah, /run can give some errors. ignore those.
[20:04:59] <ada_> ^ 
[20:05:15] <guy_frm_yogaland> it showed nothing
[20:05:19] <programmerq> if you have mlocate installed and updatedb has been run, you can do locate -br '^docker-compose$'
[20:05:31] <ada_> then find didn't find anything
[20:05:40] <programmerq> if you don't have it, sudo apt install mlocate && sudo updatedb
[20:06:21] <guy_frm_yogaland> yes, I had xampp server earlier installed and was advised by someone few days back to unintsall it and delete the lampp folder so i have done that as well
[20:06:46] <programmerq> if that xampp installer included compose, then that uninstall may have deleted it.
[20:07:26] <programmerq> so you can go back to that compose install instruction link I posted earlier.
[20:08:15] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok, let me check it and follow along
[20:14:04] <blackwood821> programmerq: is there a way with supervisord to have it not start one process until the process above it finishes?

[20:43:46] <programmerq> blackwood821â–¸ no idea. check that config reference and see if that's a thing.
[20:44:36] <diverdude> Hi - is it somehow possible to stop and start 1 server from a docker-compose file (and leave the rest which were started from same docker-compose file, running )?
[20:49:29] <aab_> you mean stop a container?
[20:49:51] <programmerq> docker-compose start|stop|restart <service>
[20:50:02] *** Quits: rsx (~dummy@ppp-188-174-134-157.dynamic.mnet-online.de) (Quit: rsx)
[20:50:29] <diverdude> yes - sorry...a container :)
[20:50:45] <aab_> docker ps
[20:51:03] <programmerq> blackwood821â–¸ maybe instead of supervisord, you could just use the pattern that the official postgres image uses. it does setup during the entrypoint, and then starts postgres.
[20:51:05] <aab_> to get the docker ID and then > docker stop [container_id]
[20:52:22] <blackwood821> programmerq: not a bad idea for this particular image. I might try that. But I have another image that will have multiple services (porting a legacy application) in which case I will need supervisord
[20:53:51] <diverdude> hmm ok i tried sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose stop zuibackend and then sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose start zuibackend, but logs were not cleared
[20:53:55] <programmerq> you can still separate out startup type setup stuff into an entrypoint script so it runs before supervisored even starts.
[20:54:35] <programmerq> diverdudeâ–¸ stopping and starting a container doesn't delete it. the logs for a given container are there until the container is deleted or until they rotate out (if you have specified retention)
[20:55:07] <diverdude> programmerq: i see... so i have to do stop, rm and then start?
[20:55:25] <programmerq> docker-compose rm -f --stop <service> && docker-compose up -d
[20:55:31] <programmerq> you can't start something that you have removed.
[20:55:53] <programmerq> also, set a logging retention if you're restarting to clear disk space.
[20:57:06] *** Joins: lightstalker (~BT@user/lightstalker)
[20:57:07] <programmerq> best way to do it is to add the retention options to /etc/docker/daemon.json and then reload (or restart) docker. any containers created after that will have the options you set in there. any existing containers will have their existing logging config.
[20:57:12] <diverdude> aha thanks

[23:13:11] <g1eb> hi! anyone proficient in using docker-compose files to build and run images?
[23:13:28] <g1eb> im trying to add the --no-cache build arg to the compose file 
[23:14:47] <programmerq> --no-cache isn't a "build arg". You can do docker-compose build --no-cache
[23:29:53] <SJrX> I upgraded my arch linux system (rolling distribution recently) after coming back from vaaction, and I've noticed something weird. A bunch of containers seem to just get stuck doing random things. Yum just starts consuming 100% cpu usage, same with rabbitmq. Running "docker run rabbitmq:3.6" after completely blowing away /var/lib/docker just hangs. Running the latest version of docker, and it is probably not docker itself that is the 
[23:29:53] <SJrX> problem, but I was wondering if anyone had an idea.
[23:30:27] <g1eb> @programmerq ahh i see, okay
