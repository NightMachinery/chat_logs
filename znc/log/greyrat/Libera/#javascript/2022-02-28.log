[00:16:31] <mikrosis> blueagain: I am already using it for the whole project

[00:19:19] <mikrosis> :(
[00:19:21] <mikrosis> next lib
[00:19:51] <mikrosis> blueagain: ideally I would want to fetch JSON data for the app on app start. If the user is fast enough the user may end up on a page that uses the data which is still loading. For that I use a skeleton placeholder.
[00:21:31] <blueagain> mikrosis: that's what we at my workplace too with react
[00:21:35] <blueagain> we do*
[00:22:03] <mikrosis> yes
[00:22:04] <mikrosis> https://betterprogramming.pub/fetching-data-with-react-72df95683c70
[00:22:15] <mikrosis> this seems to be most recent approach for react fetching
[00:22:44] *** Parts: nemo (nemo@hedgewars/dev/nemo) ()
[00:23:26] <onosendi> mikrosis: the answer you're looking for goes way beyond "movies is of `unknown` type". You need to type the result of `fetchMovies`.
[00:23:34] <mikrosis> yes
[00:23:49] <mikrosis> I did that  fetchMovies(props:any):Promise<MovieType>
[00:26:05] <onosendi> mikrosis: It would need to be Promise<MovieType[]> since it's an array of type `MovieType`, but I don't think that will solve the error it's giving you.

[00:27:20] <onosendi> alMalsamo: Vue.js is a framework written in JavaScript.

[00:28:04] <mikrosis> onosendi: alright, the best practice in 2022 for react fetch stuff is using React Suspense + SWR/React Query instead
[00:28:06] <mikrosis> which looks quite cool
[00:28:50] <systemfault> alMalsamo: Vue.js is something called a framework (It's a big pile of JavaScript on which people can build an application in JavaScript) written using JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language. By using Vue.js, you're using JavaSCript
[00:29:18] <onosendi> mikrosis: I'm currently loving RTK Query, but I also use Redux.
[00:29:22] <blueagain> onosendi: remember I talked about picking a name for my testing framework, and settled for 'debris'?

[06:29:04] <matsaman> theskillwithin: was very good
[06:29:25] <banana_> but not like nirvana or that stuff that was way before my time, but listened to nirvana in the early 2000s
[06:29:29] <matsaman> was a remastered version for ... 3DS?
[06:29:50] <matsaman> but the widescreen & third party texture upgrades are a little nicer, IMO
[06:29:56] <wyclif> I met Kurt Cobain before Nirvana broke and got famous
[06:30:07] <theskillwithin> back then we listened to music on the radio
[06:30:12] <matsaman> wyclif: happy guy?
[06:30:29] <banana_> dude I only remember mtv afterhours in the early 2000s
[06:30:36] <wyclif> I was working at a record store and they did Record Store Day and played a show in the store. Afterward we went out back so Kurt could smoke a cigarette and all we talked about was music and what his fave bands were
[06:30:43] <banana_> maybe a few music vids in the late late 90s
[06:30:50] <wyclif> At the time he just seemed like a normal dude. No drama
[06:31:00] <wyclif> This was before Courtney and a lot of his problems
[06:31:03] <theskillwithin> he was probably murdered
[06:31:05] <matsaman> mmm
[06:31:15] <banana_> wyclif: wow really?!
[06:31:24] <banana_> that's cool
[06:31:40] <matsaman> what'd they play in the store?
[06:31:58] <wyclif> Yeah. My first impression of him was that he was a slacker and how small he was.
[06:32:07] <wyclif> They played a lot of songs from "Bleach"
[06:32:31] <matsaman> slackers are what humans should be, after all
[06:32:50] <wyclif> They were really scrappy. Touring in a van. Living the life on the road
[06:33:02] <theskillwithin> also there was the smashing pumpkins
[06:33:10] <matsaman> shoot, I'd tour in a van if it meant no day job
[06:33:24] <banana_> dude smashing pumpkins is still tourin
[06:33:51] <wyclif> When they broke big and knocked Michael Jackson off the top of the chart, nobody was more surprised than me

[06:34:11] <banana_> haha
[06:34:45] <KevinX> that's awesome
[06:34:46] <banana_> that whole grunge scene was big, but yeah  before my time

[08:18:53] <sheetjs> but the point of the XLSX export is that it will be opened in Excel, otherwise you would just keep the data in JSON or something more suitable
[08:18:58] <banana_> so your library doesn't think it's corrupt?
[08:19:37] <banana_> you never know
[08:19:37] <sheetjs> what makes a worksheet with 65531 links corrupt in a way that a worksheet with 65530 isn't?
[08:19:50] <banana_> maybe .xls will be used for some popular app

[08:20:44] <banana_> like the open source sheets desktop app
[08:21:30] <sheetjs> systemfault: you're pointing to an implementation limit.  nothing fundamental to the hyperlink mandates index storage in a uint16_t
[08:21:47] <sheetjs> Excel could have used a uint32_t under the hood and solved the problem
[08:22:20] <systemfault> And waste 2 bytes for nothing in the 90s?
[08:22:53] <sheetjs> XLSX is an xml-based format, so the question really affects how Excel 2019 behaves
[08:23:13] <systemfault> Hmm, right
[08:23:49] <sheetjs> i'd agree if we were talking about XLSB or XLS which would have an immutable field size

[08:55:33] <blahboybaz> I'm trying to think if there is another way to go about comparing the elements of two arrays and finding any elements that are not in both.. The only thing I can think of is to use one array as for your starging elements, pick the first element of that array then compare it to all the elements of the second array, if a match is found remove the element from both arrays, if no match is found add the
[08:55:39] <blahboybaz> unique elements to a new arraytake the second element of the first array and compare it to all the remaining elements of the second array, if a match is found remove the element from both arrays, if no match is found add the unique elements to a new array.. continus this process until every elemnt of the first array has been compared wiith every element of the second array.
[08:55:44] <blahboybaz> The problem is that this seems like a very costly process. But I am not thinking of any other approach to this that might be more efficient. Any suggestions to help kick start my brain into thinking of other ideas?

[09:10:35] <ljharb> just like ===
[09:11:12] <Maxdamantus> Presumably it would be more accurate to say that `Set` and `Map` canonicalise -0 to +0.
[09:11:14] <ljharb> blahboybaz: at any rate, "costly" is a waste of time to worry about. you're dealing with tiny arrays here (like, less than a million items), so the performance is basically instant

[09:14:22] <ljharb> this was all a very bad decision, ofc
[09:14:29] <ljharb> Map and Set should have differentiated +0 and -0
[09:14:36] <blahboybaz> ok
[09:14:41] <blahboybaz> thanks for pointing that out
[09:14:50] <Maxdamantus> imo it's better that they don't differentiate it.
[09:15:32] *** Joins: silverdust (~silverdus@user/silverdust)
[09:15:34] <Maxdamantus> I think if there are good enough reasons to differentiate it, they should allow construction of non-canonicalised tuples.
[09:16:02] <Maxdamantus> then people who actually want to differentiate can opt in by wrapping their keys in `#![x]` or something
[09:16:49] <ljharb> those don't exist yet
[09:17:02] <ljharb> the problem is that it'd be easy to make a subclass that canonicalizes
[09:17:17] <ljharb> but it's actually impossible to make a subclass that *doesn't*, because borrowed base class methods ignore overrides
[09:17:27] <Maxdamantus> But then you have to make subclasses of all the things.
[09:17:34] <Maxdamantus> rather than just one thing, which could be tuples.
[09:17:35] <ljharb> only if you want to care about -0 vs +0
[09:17:47] <ljharb> and tuples don't exist, so they're not relevant to a discussion about Map and Set in 2015
[09:17:57] <Maxdamantus> (and in the tuples case, it's not even a subclass/subtype, it's just a difference in behaviour on construction)
[09:18:32] <han-solo> i'm curious, when would anyone want to care about -0 and +0 ? :/
[09:18:56] <Maxdamantus> If you want to do an arbitrary value mapping, you can consciously handle -0 differently quite easily.
[09:19:12] <ljharb> han-solo: i often do
[09:19:24] <han-solo> i can't seem to figure a use case
[09:19:26] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: no, you can't, because `Set.prototype.add.call` ignores that different handling
[09:19:34] <Maxdamantus> const NEGATIVE_ZERO = {}; function key(v){ return Object.is(v, )
[09:19:39] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: and robust code doesn't call OO methods directly off of builtin instances

[09:20:34] <ljharb> that only works if you never expose the map instance
[09:20:45] <ljharb> and at that point you don't need a Map anyways
[09:20:49] <Maxdamantus> Don't expose the map instance.
[09:21:03] <Maxdamantus> Map is useful without exposure.

[09:21:32] <Maxdamantus> It's the only way of mapping arbitrary values (other than zero) to things, other than using a big object list.
[09:21:52] <Maxdamantus> other than negative zero*
[09:23:15] <ljharb> sure but if it's not an exposed instance, then it doesn't matter what algorithm it uses
[09:23:22] <ljharb> your `key` example would work identically for either scenario
[09:23:48] <ljharb> i'm taking about the actual primary use case for map instances - which have the instances exposed - and also using that with robust code that doesn't trust methods hanging off of builtins.
[09:24:39] <Maxdamantus> It does for performance. As I was saying, the only other way of mapping arbitrary values (including object values) involves a big list, where you potentially have to compare an object value individually to every other value in the list.
[09:26:00] <Maxdamantus> function contains(a, k){ for(const v of a) if(Object.is(v, k)) return true; return false; } // this is dumb
[09:27:14] <Maxdamantus> and you never need to expose a map instance. you can always encapsulate a map inside your own interface.
[09:27:47] <Maxdamantus> it could be one that looks the same as a map, just treats `-0` and `0` as distinct. ie, you can implement your "subtype" in user code.
[09:27:53] <ljharb> right. but with either SameValue or SameValueZero on the base class, you'd do the same thing if you wanted the alternative.
[09:28:05] <ljharb> iow, you have presented precisely zero arguments that make either choice better than the other
[09:30:30] <Maxdamantus> The existing `Map` doesn't use either of those in particular.
[09:30:50] <Maxdamantus> it can be described as using either, and you'd have the same behaviour, because it canonicalises before having a chance to do that check.
[09:30:52] <ljharb> yes, it does. it uses SameValueZero.
[09:31:11] <Maxdamantus> No. It canonicalises, as demonstrated by my initial example.
[09:31:26] <ljharb> the literal specification - the sole authority on the subject - describes it as using SameValueZero. https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-map.prototype.delete
[09:31:38] <ljharb> that it canonicalizes means that perhaps with observable JS you can't tell one way or the other
[09:31:45] <ljharb> but the spec says SameValueZero, and it can't be debated
[09:32:04] <Maxdamantus> If it used `SameValueZero` *instead* of canonicalising, there would be some arguably odd results when you do `map.set(-0, "foo"); map.set(0, "bar");` does it have `-0` as the key now, or `0`?
[09:32:20] <ljharb> it does specifically canonicalize in https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-map.prototype.set
[09:32:24] <ljharb> but it doesn't do that anywhere else

[09:32:38] <Maxdamantus> My point is the spec could replace `SameValueZero` with `SameValue` there, and there would be no change to implementations, since there is no behavioural difference.
[09:32:59] <ljharb> perhaps it could, i'd have to dig into it. but that's an academic argument. it says SameValueZero; that's the answer.
[09:33:57] <Maxdamantus> They're not going to invent a third type of equality just for `Map`, so they just refer to one of the ones that already exist, and it happens that it didn't matter which one they used.

[09:34:15] <ljharb> so it absolutely matters.
[09:34:28] <Maxdamantus> Okay, sure. I guess it matters in that sense.
[09:34:32] <ljharb> you could *write* the spec so it was observably the same and used SameValue. but that's not the way the spec was written.

[09:34:57] <blahboybaz> counted? (ie: an object with 2 properties was added to the set last).
[09:35:23] <Maxdamantus> Not relevant to the initial point though, about whether it would be better to canonicalise or not.
[09:35:38] <ljharb> sure
[09:35:48] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: none of the arguments you've presented have been relevant to that point tho, either.
[09:36:11] <blahboybaz> Oh, I see it. I made a mistake
[09:36:23] <Maxdamantus> My point about still being able to opt in should be relevant.
[09:36:37] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: with either choice, someone gets the behavior they want for free, and someone has to do something extra
[09:36:47] <Maxdamantus> It does the generally desirable thing, but if you really want that `SameValueZero` behaviour, you can still get that from the primitive `Map` implementation.
[09:36:50] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: my argument is that the base class should be the most permissive, and subclasses should restrict, instead of the reverse.
[09:37:18] <ljharb> iow, `-0` and `0` should be two keys in the base class, and a subclass should be able to treat them as the same
[09:37:32] <ljharb> using SameValue would also have made Map and Set into Functors, which they are currently not.
[09:37:38] <Maxdamantus> Nowhere else in the language lets you accidentally treat `-0` and `0` as non-equal.
[09:37:44] <ljharb> so there's a ton of category theory properties Map and Set fail to provide
[09:37:47] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: Object.is
[09:37:51] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: also, division
[09:37:53] <Maxdamantus> You have to either use `Object.is` or cause a division by infinity.
[09:37:58] <ljharb> ok so that's two places
[09:38:06] <ljharb> but also, nowhere else in the language lets you use an object as a key
[09:38:06] <Maxdamantus> or rather, cause a division by zero.
[09:38:18] <ljharb> Map and Set are brand new kinds of things. precedence arguments don't hold water.
[09:38:35] <Maxdamantus> `Object.is` is the "opt-in" mechanism for treating `-0` and `0` as non-equal.
[09:38:55] <Maxdamantus> and division by zero is an edge case. If you've caused a division by zero, you've probably got other problems.
[09:39:49] <ljharb> it's a normal part of IEEE 754
[09:39:59] <ljharb> you can't just reduce it to an "edge case", it's critical JS Number behavio0r.
[09:40:02] <ljharb> *behavior
[09:40:15] <ljharb> but also, canonicalizing isn't something that's done elsewhere in the language
[09:40:24] <ljharb> well, that's not quite accurate
[09:40:34] <Maxdamantus> IEEE-754 doesn't even provide something like `Object.is`
[09:40:39] <Maxdamantus> you have to divide by zero to distinguish.
[09:40:57] <ljharb> sure. and that's a normal non-edge case.
[09:42:15] <Maxdamantus> I would very much say it's an edge case. If you're relying on DBZ behaviour, you should be using it consciously.
[09:43:30] <Maxdamantus> it basically lets you write something like `a/b > 0` while allowing `b` to be zero and not checking the signum of `b` beforehand.

[09:44:29] <Maxdamantus> No, you probably don't do it for arithmetical reasons. You probably do it because you're mapping arbitrary JS values.

[09:49:41] <Maxdamantus> IEEE-754 probably thought that that might be a nice shortcut, but since they didn't provide an `Object.is`-like operation, I don't think they were expecting the distinction to be carried up to higher levels.

[11:27:01] <Maxdamantus> well, I guess `Object.is` exists for `NaN` too.

[12:05:23] <blahboybaz> I don't get what is going on with the arguments obeject and/or slice() in this exmaple: https://onecompiler.com/javascript/3xuq6by7d
[12:05:34] <blahboybaz> What happened to arguments[2] ?
[12:07:09] <Maxdamantus> An array is being created with the same sequence of values as `arguments`
[12:07:47] <Maxdamantus> and `slice` is just being applied to that.
[12:08:02] <Maxdamantus> so `target = [[1, 2, 3, ...], 2, 3].slice(2);` or `target = [3];`
[12:09:21] *** Joins: admin123 (~harrymore@ool-2f12f5b1.dyn.optonline.net)
[12:12:41] <blahboybaz> Maxdamantus: It looks like the arguments object is not an array but has property names '0', '1', and '2'. So I'm not sure how slice() would do anything since it is an Array.prototype method. How is the value of the first artuments object property being accessed?
[12:13:34] <blahboybaz> [...arguments] on line 8 should be converting all of the arguments object into an array - shouldn't it?
[12:14:15] <Maxdamantus> blahboybaz: yes, `[...arguments]` converts it from an array-like object to an actual array.
[12:14:38] *** Quits: admin123 (~harrymore@ool-2f12f5b1.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[12:15:29] <blahboybaz> Maxdamantus: So I would have expected that array to be: [[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3] an array containing an array and then two numbers
[12:15:43] <Maxdamantus> blahboybaz: yes, that's correct.
[12:15:49] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[12:17:11] <blahboybaz> So then the first element of that array should be [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]  the array in the first element and slice(arguments[1]); should have ... wait a minute
[12:20:02] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:20:40] <blahboybaz> Because the [] aren't always referencing an array but in another case are destructuring the arguments operator and just addressing that one property?
[12:21:23] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[12:21:57] <stenno> n> [1][[[[[0]]]]]
[12:21:58] <jellobot> (okay) 1
[12:22:02] <Maxdamantus> The postfix `[]` always denotes property access. `arguments[2]` is equivalent to `arguments["2"]`, so semantically it's accessing the "2" property on the object.
[12:22:23] <stenno> n> [[[[[0]]]]].toString()
[12:22:23] <jellobot> (okay) '0'
[12:22:39] <Maxdamantus> that also happens to work on array objects, where each value in the sequence is just a property on the object.
[12:23:33] <stenno> n> Array.from({ '0': 23, length: 1 })
[12:23:34] <jellobot> (okay) [ 23 ]
[12:24:22] <Maxdamantus> n> Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call({ foo: 42 }, "foo"); @ blahboybaz
[12:24:23] <jellobot> blahboybaz, true
[12:24:32] <Maxdamantus> n> Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call([42], "0"); @ blahboybaz
[12:24:33] <jellobot> blahboybaz, true
[12:25:25] <Maxdamantus> n> const o = { foo: 42 }; const a = [42]; console.log(o["foo"]); console.log(a["0"]); @ blahboybaz
[12:25:25] <jellobot> blahboybaz, 42 42
[12:26:56] <blahboybaz> I don't think [...arguments] is actually converting the arguments object to an arry. The spread operator must be doing somthing different. The reason I say this is that when I console.log(target) it prints the contents of but not surrounded in [] brackets the same way it does when I console.log(arr) - the latter prints the contents surrounded in [] brackets
[12:27:35] <Maxdamantus> blahboybaz: that's just the behaviour of `toString` on arrays.
[12:27:51] <Maxdamantus> n> const a = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]; a.toString(); @ blahboybaz
[12:27:52] <jellobot> blahboybaz, 'foo,bar,baz'
[12:28:44] <blahboybaz> I think I see what I was doing wrong
[12:28:46] <Maxdamantus> It's a pretty silly behaviour. You pretty much never want to use `Array.prototype.toString`
[12:29:19] <blahboybaz> I had the worng arg in slice()  I was accessing a property in the arguments object rather than an element in the newly converted array
[12:29:22] <blahboybaz> I think
[12:31:41] <Maxdamantus> Sure, but it shouldn't matter.
[12:31:50] <Maxdamantus> `[...arguments][2]` is the same as `arguments[2]`
[12:32:59] <Maxdamantus> I'm not sure what you're expecting though. I described the behaviour of the code without running it. After I ran it, I got the result I described.
[12:33:04] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[12:33:45] <blahboybaz> err.. my goal was to strip off the remaining arguments after arguments[0] regardless of how many there may be - different total number or arguments fed into the function where it is called
[12:34:09] <Maxdamantus> Then maybe you're wanting `.slice(1)`
[12:34:10] <blahboybaz> https://onecompiler.com/javascript/3xuq6by7d  <--  fits the bill (works as intended)

[12:35:12] <Maxdamantus> The argument to `.slice` is the desired start index, and array indices start from 0, so if you want to skip 1, you use `.slice(1)`, not `.slice(2)`

[12:50:05] <Maxdamantus> rendar: it exists as a keyword in ES5, but it's only reserved.
[12:50:16] <rendar> i see
[12:50:24] <rendar> so es5 minifier should understand that
[12:51:08] <Maxdamantus> an ES5 minifier will know not to use `class` as a variable name, but it won't know what to do if it sees the `class` keyword, because `class` is specifically invalid in ES5.

[19:39:55] <ljharb> blueagain: esbuild is also trying to be a bundler, for one, and that’s already “more than one thing”, so that’s not a good start
[19:40:14] <ljharb> blueagain: but also, it’s not authored in JS. non-js tools for js are a bad idea; they’ll inevitably fail due to a lack of contribution.

[19:44:34] <ljharb> it includes http and https and net. those aren’t web servers by themselves, they’re just the bare minimum you need for it
[19:45:12] <blueagain> that's just semantics, you can write a program that's capable of serving web content with a few lines

[19:51:50] <ljharb> blueagain: I’m sure you can come up with a number of useful non-platform tools that do more than one thing. That may challenge the absoluteness of my comment, but it does not change that a tool should be a bundler or a transpiler, but not both.
[19:52:10] <ljharb> if the goal is to be a better transpiler, replace *babel*
[19:52:23] <ljharb> if the goal is to be s better bundler, *leverage* babel
[19:52:34] <ljharb> trying to solve both at the same time is madness

[19:52:59] <blueagain> I'm actually pretty much on your side here. I would prefer esbuild called itself a *build* system and offered functionalities via plugins
[19:53:06] <Kirjava> it does
[19:53:14] <Kirjava> it's more like a linker
[19:53:25] <blueagain> the transpiling is built-in though

[19:54:57] <blueagain> I agree *go* per se has high changes of producing rot, but *python* probably doesn't
[19:55:09] <ljharb> Kirjava: it would, but slowness doesn’t matter until correctness is assured

[19:55:56] <ljharb> blueagain: if i have to learn another language to maintain my tooling, it’s not going to get maintained
[19:56:08] <blueagain> so your philosophy is that tools *for* a language are best written *in* the language?

[20:16:10] <ljharb> blueagain: absolutely. Altho ts is at least pretty close to js (but not a superset)
[20:16:38] <ljharb> Kirjava: sure but projects that take forever to build are due to the project itself being too large and complex.

[20:31:54] <ljharb> Kirjava: that's notable, sure. but that can apply to the dev experience, doesn't mean it should apply to CI/test/prod
[20:32:47] <Kirjava> it actually builds faster in prod than dev because it's not making source maps
[20:32:53] <blacked> han-solo i've no friend, walking alone feels like everybody watching me, while here i've exam holiday for 30 days, literally nobody in room

[20:33:31] <Kirjava> are you suggesting to use a different toolchain for prod/CI by that?
[20:34:14] <blueagain> the whole idea of using ninja/meson is to build the project cross-platform

[23:11:21] <ljharb> !this @ alguien
[23:11:21] <jellobot> alguien, A function call of the form `a.b()` calls the function with `this` being the value of `a`; in a call of the form `f()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function wasn't defined in strict mode. Note that arrow functions and functions produced by `Function.prototype.bind` ignore the passed `this` value. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this

[23:55:26] <EdFletcher> at a previous company where i was a founding member, we had a PM come onboard about a year into the company who wanted to implement Agile everywhere. my small (two-man) team fought against it for us and even as we grew, we remained the most agile (lowercase "a") team in the whole company. ironic, that.
[23:55:36] <ljharb> iow, agile is great for companies that are afraid to do rapid releases
[23:55:50] <ljharb> but for modern companies that don't have that obsolete mentality, agile isn't helpful
[23:56:38] <EdFletcher> so agile as a forcing function against internal fears? that actually kinda makes sense, never heard it positioned that way.
[23:57:01] <ljharb> probably because when it was invented, those weren't seen as "internal fears" but rather as the normal way things are done
[23:57:06] <ljharb> but that was decades ago

[23:57:43] <EdFletcher> yup indeed
[23:57:59] <systemfault> There "agile"(4 lines of the original manifesto) and "monetized agile"(scrum and others)...
[23:58:30] <EdFletcher> yeah and it's definitely the latter that is Considered Harmful
[23:59:19] <EdFletcher> but four lines of any manifesto is a big 'ol nothing burger, it's idea without execution, so in reality the modern manifestation of Agile really _is_ agile, regardless of how different the original manifesto may be.
