[03:46:08] <wez> BtbN: Generally people get around that by creating a new dockerfile with the specific os or python verison in it.  You could also extend an existing python dockerfile.
[03:48:06] <BtbN> I'd have to copy a several hundred line strong dockerfile, just for that one change.
[03:48:17] *** Parts: gebbione (~gebbione@82-132-220-225.dab.02.net) (Leaving)
[03:48:20] <BtbN> And then ensure that whenever that specific version of Python is used, to use that other file.
[03:48:30] <BtbN> Huge complexification of the entire toolchain and workflow.
[03:49:06] <rawtaz> BtbN: you havent been very specific about the actual details of the requirement/need (other than your view on what needs to be done to solve it). so you get just general answers like this.
[03:49:20] <BtbN> I've quite literally described the problem.
[03:49:30] <rawtaz> another suggesiton; cant you like write that value to some file and have an entryscript read it and do some env setting based on that (when the container starts)?
[03:49:32] <BtbN> With a specific python version, and env var needs to be set, or else setuptools explodes on use.
[03:49:39] <BtbN> The python version is set via a build-arg
[03:49:43] <BtbN> That's literally all there is to it
[03:49:57] <rawtaz> well if that is your opinion despite what i wrote, good! great. all is well.
[03:50:02] <rawtaz> forget i wrote anything
[03:50:12] <BtbN> There is no entry script
[03:50:18] <BtbN> this image is a base image for various other images
[03:50:18] <rawtaz> i never said there was.
[03:51:04] <BtbN> I quite literally need that shell snipped wez posted. But persited into the Dockerfile
[03:51:43] <BtbN> i.e. "ENV SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib", but only if the build-arg PYTHON_VERSION is equal to pyston.
[03:52:09] <BtbN> In all other cases, it needs to be unset, or it explodes in the other direction.
[03:52:20] <rawtaz> sounds like a dangerous image :-)
[03:52:39] <BtbN> It's a stupid bug in either pyston and/or setuptools that I need to work around.
[03:53:16] <rawtaz> i dont suppose this helps you in any way: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37057468/conditional-env-in-dockerfile

[03:53:46] <BtbN> I've looked at that, but I don't see a way to map my situation to that
[03:53:58] <BtbN> Since the variable needs to be entirely unset in the other case
[03:56:00] <BtbN> The input variable is also not a simple bool
[03:56:06] <tabakhase> BtbN dockers view there be that YOU are the one who set pyston, so it shouldnt be to hard for you to add setuptools" --- so not dockers problem - docker-ish fix would prob to swap the dockerfile to some templating engine that runs before is "empty" is not acceptable

[03:56:43] <tabakhase> not a nice answer i very much know, but thats the "direction" docker builds are thinkered, not the container comes up if it may or may not - but you tell it everythign explicitly
[03:57:01] <BtbN> tabakhase, the user building the file should not need that kind of internal knowledge about what hacky workaround env-vars python needs in that specific version with that specific image
[03:57:27] <tabakhase> (hence why you "have to pick what versions to install" rather than having any way to "tag the image with the version that was installed"
[03:57:53] <BtbN> build-args already are a templating engine. And this kind of conditional missing is a huge oversight
[03:58:38] <tabakhase> BtbN users very rarely build images - theyd use FROM yourthing:3.10 or yourthing:pyston - what do they care how that was made... (so dockers idea)
[03:58:51] <BtbN> Well, to build the image, they very much have to
[03:58:56] <BtbN> the whole build arg exists for that purpose
[03:59:18] <BtbN> otherwise I'd have to copy&paste the identical dockerfile 7 times, and then search&replace the same string. And add that one env-var for the one special case.
[03:59:22] <BtbN> That can't be the right solution
[04:00:27] <tabakhase> incined to say "no..." - build args are very much to incluence the build -- and shouldnt be for anything after, so if you build a 3.10 and a pyston flavor, so is it
[04:00:54] <BtbN> They decide what python version the image ends up with
[04:01:08] <tabakhase> so yea they shouldnt build, they should pull that image you builkd for them down --- and that templating you usually wouldnt do by hand, but obvs. with code in your ci pipeline or so

[04:01:39] <BtbN> So I should turn my entire CI pipleine to shit, because of insufficiencies of docker?
[04:01:57] <BtbN> Like, all I need is one env var, with one specific python version.
[04:02:00] <tabakhase> they very much decide sure, but should by switching there FROM 
[04:02:13] <BtbN> And I should either duplicate thousands of lines, or throw some entire extra layer of abstraction on top?
[04:02:17] <BtbN> That's not the right way, no
[04:02:41] <BtbN> The various images that fall out of this obviously have a different tag. So your statement makes no sense.
[04:03:32] <BtbN> Users only get in contact with the actual Dockerfile if they need a specific version, which happens quite regularily
[04:03:44] <rawtaz> is it possible to do like  ENV SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS${DOIT:-NOT}=stdlib  in your Dockerfile, and in the outside environment you set the  DOIT  env var to an empty value if PYTHON_VERSION or whatever is equal to pyston?
[04:03:50] <tabakhase> if you have FROM tools, and tim wants 3.10 tools but dennis wants pyston - the only fix is that you provide tools:3.10 for tim, and tools:pyston for dennis -- and noone of either will ever care about your dockerfile
[04:04:02] <BtbN> That's already what I do
[04:04:03] <rawtaz> its a hack, but might work (assuming you can set or not set the DOIT var externally)
[04:04:16] <BtbN> but sometimes a user wants 3.10.0 or python2.3.0 instead of whatever is latest
[04:04:35] <BtbN> Pretty sure you can't do variable substitution on the left side of the =
[04:04:51] <rawtaz> worth trying. i dont expect it to work either but ffs one never knows :P
[04:05:07] <BtbN> And I'd still would need to somehow translate PY_VER=pyston into a boolean
[04:05:59] <rawtaz> yes. cant you do that in the outside env that sets the build args? i thought by build arg you meant  --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=pyston
[04:06:21] <rawtaz> and then was thinking that in that command you could just add an env var if [ ... ]
[04:06:22] <BtbN> Yes, but I don't want the outside of the image to need that kind of knowledge to special case pyston
[04:06:38] <rawtaz> well then you are fucked, my friend.
[04:06:41] <tabakhase> ^^^
[04:06:44] <rawtaz> either deal with that or hack/work around :P
[04:06:53] <BtbN> That's a severe deficience of docker there
[04:07:04] <BtbN> either build args should get scrapped entirely, or this should be possible
[04:07:06] <rawtaz> theres lots with docker thats imperfect
[04:07:28] <BtbN> Like, add an --if=... to every command via buildkit or something
[04:08:06] <BtbN> So you could ENV --if=${PYTHON_VERSION}==pyston ...
[04:08:17] <rawtaz> better to just improve the expansion syntax in Dockerfiles etc
[04:08:27] <BtbN> Well, that's what that is.
[04:08:27] <rawtaz> right, that works
[04:09:03] <rawtaz> just let is run shell commands inside ${} instead :P
[04:09:23] <rawtaz> preferrably as root so we dont have any issues with anything anymore
[04:09:37] <BtbN> I'm not even sure who evaluates that ${}. Like, ${BLA:-...} is shell syntax. Is that stuff passed through a shell?
[04:09:48] <BtbN> Or is that just docker emulating a shell
[04:10:37] <tabakhase> end is rly just if you think a user may want 3.10.1 - give em a way to reuest that / may just be "add your thing in the matrix: in the ci file" -- or if they really insist on doing the artisan thign, running a "buildMyDocker.sh" that runs some quick cp&sed-commands before building is perfectly fine
[04:11:17] <BtbN> We can't offer all versions under the sun
[04:11:29] <BtbN> Since we can't afford to pay Dockerhub for all of them
[04:11:39] <BtbN> So it's only the latest of a few select ones
[04:11:44] <tabakhase> in fact there is uite a bit "external" tooling around the build step --- as things like docker-compose build "dont have a strong controll of the order" and its not uncommon to have images expend on another (so you want to controll the order)
[04:13:21] <tabakhase> like i dont think ive seen an official (library) image yet that does not use some extrafu...

[04:25:12] <BtbN> Why would it do something different in 6 months? What?

[04:31:18] <tabakhase> i also kinda wonder what gets you the idea SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS has to be unset - random googles spit out "local" as totally legit default value for it 
[04:31:45] <BtbN> no, the default value changes multiple times, depending on setuptools version
[04:31:50] <BtbN> so the only sane other value is to not have it set
[04:34:35] <tabakhase> what they set fliped a bit - but always between stdlib and local i mean -- so you shouldnt need ENV --not SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib but just ENV SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=local and be good with it

[04:36:28] <tabakhase> that means you obvs. have to ship this string now in with another build-arg -- and now you need to train users to hand in the correct 2 vars ((or back to start, wrapper script that knows that for them))
[04:36:43] <BtbN> No, that's not an option.
[04:36:47] <BtbN> That kind of knowledge must not leak outside.
