[01:26:17] <a6a45081-2b83> Hi guys, I did ask about my problem earlier where mounting /boo/efi is failing after a kernel update and the keyboard is not working in emergency mode
[01:26:30] <a6a45081-2b83> so I tried downgrading/upgrading back the kernel but it's not working
[01:26:43] <urawotlol> does it work with the fallback initrd image?
[01:27:02] <a6a45081-2b83> also to connect to the internet I have compiled and installed the drivers via dkms which don't work on arch iso

[03:41:14] <thurstylark> ilomiglio: the thing that weechat does specifically is called a relay, and it's a weechat-specific thing. traditionally, what you're asking about is called a bouncer and can work with other clients
[03:41:33] <Dan39> TheDcoder: bitlbee hosts a local like-ircd that you connect to and then it will connect to other chat servers to bridge them to your IRC client
[03:41:41] <Dan39> like AIM :P
[03:41:41] <TheDcoder> thurstylark: You can setup a special "IRC" relay, it will act exactly like a bouncer

[05:18:07] <DragonRiver>  GhostBSD, sort of like Ubuntu, obscure several things to "make things easier", But whenever you try to rebuild everything, you notice the cracks in the wall. Similar to how Arch doesn't hide anything, and then updates mostly work. Can you rebuild world in GhostBSD? Doubtful. But maybe you never do that. So it's a choice.

[06:18:35] <DragonRiver> It's a good card. But $175 is a lot of money. For the past two years, and maybe for the next two years, prices are definitely distorted. You should be getting twice the performance for that price.
[06:19:07] <et09> i mean, there are cards out there for 500, 1000, you know
[06:19:45] <DragonRiver> I know. My main card is an RTX A6000. Trust me I know.

[06:29:06] <ascor> I'm trying to compile the linux-hardened kernel with my usual flags (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ryzen#Kernel) but it fails at AR drivers/gpu/built-in.a. This sort of makes sense if I'm interpreting this correctly since my Ryzen doesn't have a built in GPU. It used to compile just fine in 5.15.15 so I'm wondering what has changed or how to disable this?

[06:38:17] <DragonRiver> Yeah, but maybe compiling with experimental flags invokes the AMDGPU dependencies. I'm just throwing spagetti against the wall. Normally compiling works.

[18:26:39] <alad> Foxboron: the thing of having a common backend for all metadata, with aurweb being just 1 possible frontend, was mentioned a few times
[18:26:55] <Foxboron> alad: that's the idea I always circle back towards
[18:27:05] <alad> then clients don't have to adapt to limitations of aurweb and can do whatever they like

[18:28:26] <Earnestly> Hm, aurweb itself is fine imo, but improvement would be better capacity for query, like graphql but maybe not as complicated
[18:28:51] <Foxboron> alad: aurweb could just be one index even. "aurweb says alad/aurutils is aurutils. But foxboron/aurutils and Earnestly/aurutils exist as well"
[18:28:56] <Earnestly> aur helper is good fuzzer for designing api because it shows sore points

[23:27:58] <gr33n7007h> are both my batteries ready for the knackered yard?
[23:28:10] <urawotlol> Nomenclatura: it literally says they dont have sufficent evedence to link any increase in cancer risk
[23:28:27] <gehidore> at 95%? why?
[23:28:30] <Nomenclatura> although low energy emf is considered generally safe, there are plenty of examples of epigenetic changes to cells and bacteria,

[23:29:00] <gr33n7007h> because i can't get any charger to charge them
[23:29:04] <Nomenclatura> you're right
[23:29:19] <gehidore> gr33n7007h they're at 95% that may be current max charge
[23:29:30] <gehidore> because of cell degradation
[23:29:37] <gehidore> have you tried discharging them further?
[23:29:42] <Nomenclatura> and I'm sorry for the profiling, that was low
[23:29:57] <gr33n7007h> gehidore: ah, no, i'll try discharging further and see.

[23:30:13] <gehidore> gr33n7007h I've got 2 batteries for my stinkpad that only charge to 87 and 90% respectively

[23:30:31] <gehidore> they're ~5 years old and have had likely hundreds perhaps thousands of cycles
[23:30:37] <BrainDamage> gr33n7007h: however, you must do a full charge/discharge once in a while to get the available capacity to be updated to the correct value

[23:31:22] <BrainDamage> becuase the controller cannot magically inspect the capacity from outside, it does it by integrating the current and comparing to the voltage
[23:32:09] <gr33n7007h> gehidore: BrainDamage ok and thank you, you two, that makes sense.
