[00:03:28] <DaPinkOne> holding out a hope for a season 2 someday, but i don't think it's gonna happen
[00:03:45] <emmeka> I just read a manga that is a wholesome, fluffy spinoff of a hentai doujin. Which is at least a unique source material.

[00:04:17] <DaPinkOne> emmeka, that sounds interesting. there's not enough wholesome material.
[00:04:59] <DaPinkOne> there's almost always some creepy tarnish to it
[00:05:01] <emmeka> the manga is: https://myanimelist.net/manga/115217/Fukakai_na_Boku_no_Subete_wo

[00:05:59] <emmeka> DaPinkOne I read it on Bookwalker
[00:06:21] <DaPinkOne> i haven't done bookwalker. is it worth it?
[00:06:24] <emmeka> though I went to the high seas to find the doujin first, for completion's sake
[00:07:06] <emmeka> Bookwalker has really good sales, like shit is regularly 50% or more off. But the problem is that their sales only grant store credit. So you get trapped :P
[00:07:34] <emmeka> but there's some thing about it that aren't the best, Bookwalker doesn't tend to update digital releases with updates/fixes from reprints
[00:09:31] <DaPinkOne> looks like bookwalker or  crunchy are the only legit options for manga
[00:10:06] <emmeka> nah there's plenty, all the mainstream ebook platforms sell everything that's on Bookwalker too
[00:10:22] <DaPinkOne> guess I just haven't looked hard enough
[00:10:30] <emmeka> so like Kobo, Kindle etc
[00:11:17] <emmeka> they have everything published by all the usual publishers (Viz, Seven Seas, Yen Press, Tokyopop, ie 99% of official licensed manga)
[00:11:28] <emmeka> and there's a few publishers that just run their own niche platforms
[00:13:43] <emmeka> DaPinkOne but I'm just sort of amazed this exists, this is an author who had no prior published manga, and then made a hentai doujin about an otokonoko, and then somehow successfully spun off that hentai series into a full 5 volume serialized, sfw, fluffy romance series.
[00:14:03] <emmeka> there's direct continuity, the characters from the doujin are major characters
[00:15:15] <DaPinkOne> that's kindof amazing. I wouldn't have expected wholesome and hentai to have the same target audience
[00:15:40] <DaPinkOne> I guess the wholesome-> hentai pipeline happens often enough though, why not go the other way
[00:16:00] <DaPinkOne> them's some fuckin creepers though, lewding the lolis.
[00:17:00] <emmeka> the whole thing's especially amazing considering the subject matter. trap hentai doujin -> serious, but fluffy series about sexual minorities that is handled tactfully and without fetishism

"I've always been a fan of hers," she said, "so imagine my shock when I saw her Discord notification suggesting that she might be going out with someone. Honestly, I don't even know why I receive her Discord notifications in the first place." She went on to explain that although the performer's contract with 
[08:54:40] <Nanobot> Hololive allows her to have romantic relationships and actually forbids Rushia from mentioning those relationships on stream, she still feels betrayed for reasons that surely must have some basis in logic somehow. "Really, she should have violated her contract to tell you all about her completely acceptable and normal personal life. It would have only cost both our career and my entire existence, but at least my fans would know that my performer whom most

[09:51:10] <MootPoot> so you're saying the macs is the successor to emacs
[09:51:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Okay jokes aside it's because Apple hates Free Software and won't include it in any of their stuff, they also make it complicated to build Free Software for a number of their platforms)

[09:59:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> M1 porting efforts are actually going well.
[10:00:05] <MootPoot> hmm
[10:00:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Apple has facilitated booting other OSes on the hardware.
[10:00:28] <MootPoot> I would be okay with getting a m1 mac mini and running linux on it

[10:02:58] <MootPoot> like - I picked up the galaxy book go for a test run
[10:03:05] <MootPoot> it was terrible - mainly becuase of the only 4gb of ram
[10:03:14] <MootPoot> with 8gb or something it would be decent
[10:03:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> zswap matters.
[10:03:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But yeah building a custom kernel and choosing your options can be useful.
[10:06:01] <MootPoot> they did come out with w11 on arm but

[11:04:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why?
[11:04:42] <MootPoot> laptop  = portable | carrying an adapter around = not portable
[11:04:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm leery of USB-C charging because to be sure you're safe you have to buy testing equipment to ensure the cable you get is actually capable of properly taking the load.
[11:05:03] <MootPoot> not really
[11:05:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because some build non-compliant shit that can only take data.
[11:05:07] <MootPoot> the charger already deals with that
[11:05:14] <MootPoot> on its end
[11:05:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The OEM one yes, not the ones you might buy later.
[11:05:28] <MootPoot> I mean - fix to that is to not buy a shit charger
[11:05:41] <MootPoot> but I've never had any problems with that
[11:05:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The cable isn't active/smart.
[11:05:54] <MootPoot> yeah, thats why its the charger that does it
[11:05:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It's been an increasingly common cause of minor fires lately.
[11:05:59] <MootPoot> not the cable
[11:06:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The charger cannot guess how much load the cable can safely take without warming up dangerous.
[11:06:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *dangerously
[11:06:38] <MootPoot> it ramps up power and checks the resistance of the copper accordingly, no?
[11:06:49] <MootPoot> when I plug in any usb C device it never goes full blast instantly
[11:06:58] <MootPoot> it slowly works its way up to max load
[11:07:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's not fully reliable.
[11:07:34] <MootPoot> eh, sure - but the risk is minor enough that I'll take it
[11:07:46] <MootPoot> I wanted a LG gram but passed on it since it still used that barrel connector
[11:08:06] <MootPoot> the new usb C standard is supposed to pass through upto like 220w
[11:08:09] <MootPoot> or was it 200
[11:08:18] <MootPoot> most I've used is 65
[11:10:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'll need to read the parts of the spec on power delivery negociation.

[14:11:30] <nuke> no.
[14:11:30] <Cryowolf> download is 100
[14:11:30] <Bco1981> ah
[14:11:43] <Cryowolf> if my upload was higher, I'd up my seed%
[14:11:43] <Bco1981> and you don't have stuff that can run 24/7

[14:11:58] <JesseDesu> blow me away
[14:12:01] <nuke> u didnt even bought me dinner
[14:12:03] <Cryowolf> I do but uploading can interfere with playing games online
[14:12:31] <Cryowolf> it also gets in the way of my max slots
[14:12:32] <Bco1981> sure but as long as you limit the torrent upload to 2mbit it's fine
[14:12:39] <JesseDesu> oh you joke now
[14:12:55] <JesseDesu> joke about coke
[14:13:04] <Bco1981> then you won't even notice it's running.
[14:13:04] <Cryowolf> I use an old utorrent cause I haven't found a good new one thatdoesn't slow my system down (or has a cryptominer in it)
[14:13:14] <Bco1981> me too
[14:13:18] <Bco1981> 3.3 i think
[14:13:32] <Cryowolf> and too many active torrents on that makes them go weird
[14:13:40] <Bco1981> lol yeah
[14:13:44] <Cryowolf> like they complete but.... they dont download everything
[14:13:45] <JesseDesu> i have my upload on default
[14:13:47] <Bco1981> then you have too many at the same time
[14:14:00] <Cryowolf> so there's a file and there's .ut
[14:14:04] <Cryowolf> but the file is corrupt
[14:14:19] <Cryowolf> and if I delete it and run recheck, the .ut is't complete
[14:14:23] <Cryowolf> isn't
[14:14:27] <Bco1981> weird, i don't recall having that problem even with more then 100 on the list
[14:14:54] <Cryowolf> mybe 3.3 works better, but is 3.3 a newer one? Cause I know at some point, they added a cryptominer
[14:15:19] <Bco1981> i don't see it on this one. the cpu does nothing.
[14:15:27] <Cryowolf> the .ut problem usually only occurs if I download like a full season of something
[14:15:33] <Cryowolf> in another folder
[14:15:46] <Bco1981> i know because i monitor it from a snmp server.
[14:17:10] <Bco1981> the only problems with the 3.3 was ads, but you can remove them in the settings.
[14:17:40] <Bco1981> and it gets unstabil when your disk is 100% loaded.
[14:17:41] <Cryowolf> is there anything better than utorrent now?
[14:17:55] <Bco1981> dont know, haven't looked
[14:18:03] <Bco1981> it works for me :)
[14:18:12] <Cryowolf> hmmm maybe the .ut corruption happens when my disk is 100% loaded
[14:18:54] <Bco1981> i don't get corruptions even if the disk is 100% loaded and utorrent breaks so i have to force shut it.
[14:19:11] <Bco1981> it just reads the files it was working on and continues.
[14:20:35] <JesseDesu> i put contacts on

[14:35:47] <JesseDesu> you guys have too much on your plate
[14:35:50] <JesseDesu> is the problem

[14:36:12] <Cryowolf> uuuh....what?
[14:36:46] <Cryowolf> it's not asking too much for it to handle 20-30 files and seeds as long as your hdd/sdd and bandwidth can
[14:36:49] <JesseDesu> i gues that makes sense that you want the UI a certain way in order to download 20 things at once

[14:52:58] <JesseDesu> according to this article you're welcome is more formal
[14:53:08] <JesseDesu> so theres varying shades of formality
[14:53:12] <JesseDesu> just like japanese!

[14:54:00] <JesseDesu> i dont mind it

[15:02:50] <isekaijin> amigojapan: “insist on using formal Spanish”... That's so damn annoying. It's good that English doesn't have two distinct “you” pronouns (with whole different verb conjugations!) depending on formality.
[15:05:26] <amigojapan> Well I imagine it is hard on beginners isekaijin . That is not the problem I am addressing. When someone addresses be as "usted" it is like drawing a separation between me and the speaker

[15:13:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I have a mental list of things to tell the city call if stuff around this town that needs fixing. But I am kind of shy to be the one to call
[15:13:23] <DunceCotus> it requires some noodle-bending communique
[15:14:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its kind of like I think you could convince a store clerk to let you walk away with item without paying
[15:14:23] <DunceCotus> and even convince the security guard
[15:14:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: most recently a pharmacy around the corner installed a security system which annoying beeps all night long. And I need to walk by that every day
[15:14:46] <DunceCotus> but the convincing isn't on the level of consciousness we are normally aware of

[16:07:31] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Liposuction, or simply lipo, is a type of fat-removal procedure used in plastic surgery. Evidence does not support an effect on weight beyond a couple of months and does not appear to affect obesity-related problems. In the United States, liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgery.
[16:07:39] <MootPoot> lol
[16:08:33] <amigojapan> Is that what you mean? MootPoot 
[16:08:37] <MootPoot> no

[16:08:45] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[16:09:18] <MootPoot> if I can pull it off, build out the UI part of my project today
[16:13:02] <Cryowolf> Liposuction works best if you already have a working diet/nutritional intake at a healthy level of what a person would normally onsume and you perhaps reached the last part with some stubborn fat somewhere
[16:13:29] <Cryowolf> Or if you're rich and want a shortcut from little abs to full six or eightpack

[16:28:29] <Sadale> MootPoot, yes? :3
[16:28:37] <MootPoot> only 3.3v and ground
[16:28:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, I guess so? What did you mean by "turning on" tho?
[16:29:16] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you're talking about showing something on the LCD, it may not show anything if you just connect the 3.3V and ground
[16:29:20] <MootPoot> Like, just the backlight 
[16:29:26] <MootPoot> Anything to show the unit is working 
[16:29:34] <MootPoot> And not DOA

[16:35:12] <Sadale> DOA is rare tho
[16:35:44] <Sadale> MootPoot, backlight could be powered by separate pins tho.

[17:00:48] <Sadale> JesseDesu, he's talking about raspberry pi pico
[17:02:18] <MootPoot> its reporting correclty to the console on my laptop
[17:02:20] <MootPoot> idk what's going on
[17:04:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you connect the LED pin and the ground pin, I think the display backlight should turn on
[17:04:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, the LED pin to 3V3, and the ground pin to GND
[17:06:16] <MootPoot> There is no pin labelled LED on my board
[17:06:49] <Sadale> MootPoot, The product description page of your aliexpress link said that pin 8 is LED
[17:06:51] <MootPoot> I have = NDD, GND, CS , RST D/C SDI SDK BL SDO TCK TCS TDI TDC PEN
[17:06:57] <MootPoot> VDD*
[17:07:19] <MootPoot> oh, so pin 8 should be B/L
[17:07:24] <MootPoot> I guess that's backlight
[17:07:28] <Sadale> probably
[17:08:46] <MootPoot> nope
[17:09:02] <MootPoot> does not turn on
[17:09:07] <Sadale> booooooooooo
[17:09:16] <MootPoot> checked the pins with a multimeter - it is 3.3v
[17:09:57] <Sadale> I dunno then. Maybe try reseating the FPC cable? That flexible LCD cable.
[17:10:19] <Sadale> Power it off first. Then reseat it. Make sure not to bend the FPC cable hard or you could break it
[17:11:10] <Sadale> if that still ain't working I'm sorry. There probably isn't much I could help then :(

[17:11:54] <Sadale> MootPoot, actually now that I'm thinking if the LED pin requires an external current-limiting resistor
[17:12:00] *** Joins: S4ll3n (~S4ll3n@154.6.21.143)
[17:12:18] <Sadale> Without it, and if there's no built-in current limiting resistor, technically speaking, you could burn the LED
[17:12:40] <MootPoot> in the video I linked it worked without one
[17:12:46] <Sadale> true
[17:13:09] <MootPoot> reseating the cable doesn't work either
[17:13:15] <MootPoot> :(
[17:14:05] <Sadale> another stupid question. Are you sure that you didn't invert the pin connections? like taking the first pin as the last pin, the second pin as the second last pin and so on
[17:14:34] <MootPoot> they are labelled and I checked voltages on the wires with a multimeter
[17:14:38] <MootPoot> its correct
[17:14:59] <MootPoot> the two wires connecting to gnd / ( BL / LED ) are reporting 3.25v

[23:12:36] <Poeticode> Roey I'm finishing the last of my sencha, on my third infusion hoping to get another out of it :(
[23:13:08] <Roey> ha :))))
[23:13:12] <Roey> *aha :))))
[23:13:27] <Roey> wha dwhat do you like about sencha, Poeticode?
[23:13:34] <Roey> once I went puerh
[23:13:39] <Roey> I just drink that and matcha
[23:14:23] <MootPoot> Sex 
[23:14:29] <MootPoot> Roey: sex 
[23:14:37] <MootPoot> Poeticode: nice code 
[23:14:41] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: ass
[23:15:11] <MootPoot> Oh wait you're all talking about tea
[23:15:22] <Poeticode> sencha/gyokuro is naisu and grassy Roey . Sometimes I'll go for a chinese green tea, dragonwell preferably
[23:15:27] <MootPoot> Disgusting, I'm disappointed in you Roey 
[23:15:49] <MootPoot> Water > tea
[23:16:26] <Roey> lol
[23:16:39] <Roey> normally I drink either tea, or water.. like, I don't drink milk/juice
[23:16:52] <Roey> or beer/wine (ew)
[23:16:59] <MootPoot> Coffee forever
[23:17:07] <MootPoot> :) 
[23:17:59] <Roey> :)
[23:18:11] <Roey> btw there is #coffee
[23:18:19] <Roey> MootPoot: oh I drink that too
[23:18:22] <Roey> had three cups this morning
[23:19:20] <MootPoot> Covfefe
[23:19:34] <Roey> :)
[23:19:40] <Roey> Power to the patriots!
[23:19:46] <Roey> also, fuck Trudeau
[23:20:52] <MootPoot> Those fuck Trudeau stickers are kinda cringey
[23:20:56] <MootPoot> Imo
[23:21:12] <MootPoot> Like, any sticker on a car is cringy
[23:21:16] <Poeticode> I drink everything
[23:21:49] <MootPoot> But for some reason they decided to Censor out a letter and now it's even more cringey
[23:22:16] <MootPoot> Can car stickers all just go away as a concept
[23:23:03] <MootPoot> I can barely deal with licence plates being on a car as it is
[23:23:33] <MootPoot> Now people want fucking stickers all over the place? What is this, preschool scrapbooking? 
[23:24:30] * MootPoot is disgusted 
[23:24:44] <Poeticode> how about laptop stickers?
[23:24:58] <MootPoot> Also bad, but not as bad 
[23:25:04] <Poeticode> I only have one to cover up the apple logo
[23:25:11] <Poeticode> rest of my lappies are cleannnn
[23:25:12] <MootPoot> At least they can have functional information like what CPU 
[23:25:22] <MootPoot> Oh, you mean additional stickers 
[23:25:35] <Poeticode> oh yeah like those AMD stickers
[23:25:44] <MootPoot> I'll give you a pass for covering up the manufacturer logo 
[23:25:51] <MootPoot> That is a greater cause 
[23:25:56] <Poeticode> arigatouuu
[23:26:48] <MootPoot> Why would you freely advertise for them when you take your laptop outside 
[23:26:58] <MootPoot> I can respect debadging cars 
[23:27:00] <Roey> oh I just happened to find this pouch of genmaicha that I had ordered on (20191104)
[23:27:05] <Roey> I'm brewing it now
[23:27:37] <MootPoot> Poeticode: I'll give a pass to full vinyls as well 
[23:27:44] <MootPoot> Since at that point it's so much sticker 
[23:28:02] <MootPoot> That it's not a sticker anymore 
[23:31:05] <Poeticode> yes if it covers more than 50% of the object it may be more of a cover/sleeve than a sticker hmmm
[23:31:24] <MootPoot> at that point its more of an eyesore if you dont cover it all
[23:31:25] <MootPoot> imo
[23:31:43] <MootPoot> speaking of , I need a sticker for my macbook
[23:31:51] <MootPoot> I dont want to look at that apple logo on the back
