[21:49:05] <seanw> bremner: no, chiark is mailman2 still
[22:01:50] <bremner> the people on #s-expressions decided to write their own mailing list manager in scheme
[22:02:24] <bremner> which is madness, but I understand how they got there
[22:48:21] <lelit> I'm surprised to hear that mm3 is not up-to-the-task, given the long time it took to emerge
[22:48:51] <bremner> well. I guess if you run postorius, then you hate MM3 less
[23:25:10] <seanw> bremner: the new kernel.org mailing lists machine is mlmmj (they're going to gradually migrate lists from their ancient majordomo instance to this new one)
