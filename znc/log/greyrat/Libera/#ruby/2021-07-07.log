[02:12:32] <jwr> i installed ruby (via rbenv) and did `bundle install` to install my gems, which all seemed fine. but now when i try to invoke most anything, i'm getting an error that it can't find gem dependency files, but the files its referencing do indeed exist. what am i missing here? https://pastebin.com/raw/FjvHzdZP
[02:23:09] <aighearach> jwr: did you do this stuff? https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#how-rbenv-hooks-into-your-shell
[02:24:28] <jwr> aighearach: i think i did. ~/.rbenv/shims is in my $PATH, and that's where it's found via `which ruby`, for example.
[02:25:01] <aighearach> also check that `which bundler` and `rbenv which bundler` are the same
[02:25:19] <aighearach> and if not, you can either fix your path, or do rbenv exec bundler 
[02:26:50] <aighearach> jwr: It's not enough to think you did, you have to follow the instructions very correctly, and in order
[02:26:53] <jwr> aighearach: oh, hmm, `which bundler` is /root/.rbenv/shims/bundler and `rbenv which bundler` is /root/.rbenv/versions/2.6.6/bin/bundler. perhaps that means i missed something. am i supposed to have /root/.rbenv/versions/2.6.6/bin in my PATH?
[02:27:18] <aighearach> jwr: Don't install as rroot
[02:27:36] <aighearach> with rbenv you're installing the user's home dir
[02:28:17] <aighearach> so on your dev box it will run as you, and on the server it will run as your project user

[02:29:21] <jwr> aighearach: this is in the context of building a docker container, not the usual context of rbenv being used by humans. but fair point.
[02:30:08] <jwr> how does one make it so that `which bundler` and `rbenv which bundler` point to the same thing? i would have thought that to be a function of `rbenv rehash`, but perhaps not?

[02:30:54] <aighearach> You still don't use rbenv as root
[02:32:49] <aighearach> jwr: Why are you using rbenv instead of rvm?
[02:33:11] <aighearach> rbenv is the bare bones, old-school *nix one. RVM is the features and stuff one.
[02:33:15] <nakilon> rbenv > rvm
[02:33:18] <jwr> is that the reason why `which bundler` and `rbenv which bundler` evaluate differently?
[02:33:35] <aighearach> I use rbenv, but it isn't "better" unless you're a unix nerd.
[02:33:46] <nakilon> what features?
[02:34:00] <nakilon> TIL: I'm unix nerd
[02:34:37] <jwr> i don't really have a strong preference between them and i'm fine with whichever one i can get working. i tried rvm previously and found it more complicated for the context of building a stripped down docker image. but i'm not opposed to linux nerdism either.
[02:34:38] <aighearach> Well, for one thing, it doesn't require you to know how to fix whatever you did wrong in your shell. It also has features for system installation, rvmsudo 
[02:34:50] <nakilon> jwr do eval "$(jenv init -)" or add it to your bash_profile and restart the shell and check  again
[02:35:29] <nakilon> doesn't rvm or anything else at all require you to know how to fix whatever you did wrong?

[02:36:28] <aighearach> rvm is modern, normal, user-friendly software

[02:41:44] <jwr> nakilon: tried `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`, and `which bundler` and `rbenv which bundler` still evaluate to different values, and using any kind of `bundle exec ...` commands in my project still result in the same error about msgpack missing.
[02:42:41] <nakilon> how is rvm modern if it's from 2009 while rbenv is from 2011 and appeared exactly because rvm wasn't good enough?
[02:43:49] <nakilon> that error about msgpack is weird, I doubt it's because of ruby manager
[02:45:52] <jwr> FWIW `bundle list` shows the expected version of msgpack is installed... but `bundle exec` still complains about it.
[02:51:34] <nakilon> the only thing I've found in google with this error is when msgpack was somehow installed for 32 bit on 64 bit machine or something like that
[02:53:10] <nakilon> is /app a  directory mounted  to docker container that is running on different linux?

[02:54:42] <jwr> nakilon: /app isn't a docker volume, it exists only within the container. though if cpu architecture weirdness is in play, i am running an apple M1 (arm) macbook.

[02:58:36] <nakilon> if not mounted then maybe you've built it in such way? copying the installed gems stuff from M1 machine
[02:58:44] <nakilon> *built the image
[03:01:10] <jwr> when building the image i used `--platform linux/amd64`, so i'm expecting it to use that architecture. but perhaps that doesn't play nicely with this gem or with rbenv or something... i'm rerunning a build on an old macbook now to see if perhaps that's where the issue lies.
