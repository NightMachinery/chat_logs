[00:09:53] <BaronVladimirHar> Hosting your project on GitHub, as opposed to avoiding it -or- only using it as a mirror, is already a strike against your program.
[00:10:23] <BaronVladimirHar> Maybe Microsoft won't just silently disappear something as visible as Firefox like they do anyone else's project.
[00:10:59] <BaronVladimirHar> But the fact is, that Mozilla is ignoring that they do this routinely to other people, and that their pals at Microsoft support Trump and have ICE contracts, including an ICE contract with GitHub.

[02:01:14] <BaronVladimirHar> As you'd expect, Chrome and Edge were pretty bad, Firefox and Safari were so-so, and Brave was at the top.
[02:01:35] <BaronVladimirHar> But that was before "Suggest" so I'd imagine that Firefox is up there with Chrome and Edge now, in its default state.

[02:48:24] <BaronVladimirHar> Software isn't a service.
[02:48:28] <BaronVladimirHar> It's software.
[02:49:29] <BaronVladimirHar> George R. R. Martin uses a word processor from the 1980s because it works, it's not bloated with features that don't matter, and it's not demanding hundreds of MB of updates every now and then that change where everything is.
[02:49:55] <BaronVladimirHar> It's a big shame you can't just park yourself on a version of Firefox that still worked and have it work for decades.
[02:51:00] <BaronVladimirHar> Freenode coming down didn't take down other IRC servers, or affect them in any way, really.
[02:51:05] <Bradipo> It's a double-edged sword.
[02:51:12] <Bradipo> I still use vi, not vim.
[02:51:13] <BaronVladimirHar> If Mozilla wants to reload and shoot themselves in their other foot, nobody can stop them.
[02:51:33] <Bradipo> Haven't found the need for most of what vim has _improved_.
[02:52:01] <BaronVladimirHar> I call vim a lie. You can't start with the idea of vi and imagine that there's a way to make it work well.
[02:52:02] <Bradipo> I suspect, however, that the problem isn't 100% in FireFox's court.
[02:52:33] <BaronVladimirHar> They could push back more than they do.
[02:52:51] <BaronVladimirHar> Many of these web APIs google introduces are there only to facilitate abuse against the user by malicious sites.
[02:53:03] <Bradipo> For example, Teams clearly discriminates against Teams.
[02:53:08] <BaronVladimirHar> And blindly copying them doesn't help the user.
[02:53:16] <Bradipo> FireFox rather.
[02:53:40] <BaronVladimirHar> It's better and easier to refuse to implement bloated anti-features that explode in the user's face.
[02:53:52] <Bradipo> If I configure FireFox with a user-agent that pretends to be Chrome, suddenly Teams mostly works.
[02:53:58] <BaronVladimirHar> There must be some reason why Mozilla does it.
[02:54:22] <BaronVladimirHar> Bradipo: Yes, there's a lot of that. That's why Brave and Vivaldi lie to everything but search engines.

[02:55:05] <BaronVladimirHar> But on Youtube it's Safari again so we don't get Polymer, which is non-standard and breaks.
[02:55:51] <BaronVladimirHar> Google: We're building Chrome so it can be fast and standards compliant!
[02:56:17] <BaronVladimirHar> Also Google: Here's a version of Youtube that is written entirely in something that will never be a standard, other browsers get something that doesn't work well at all.
[02:56:56] <BaronVladimirHar> HTML 5 isn't much better than Flash Player with what they've done to it.
[02:57:14] <BaronVladimirHar> With pointless crap like DASH and HLS.
[02:58:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Youtube literally worked better in Gnash than it does now with "web standards" in WebkitGTK.

Like, if you're not using HTTPS because it doesn't matter that much for your site, "modern" browsers sound the alarm bells and stop the user from viewing anything, until you go beg one of these certificate cartels for one.
[03:02:07] <Bradipo> Hahah, yeah, I've thought it was pretty lame for everything to suddenly try to force HTTPS on every connection.

[03:02:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Maybe I don't care if my ISP knows I viewed the ToastyTech GUI Gallery.
[03:03:44] <BaronVladimirHar> GNOME Web tried to build HTTPS Everywhere into the browser and then backed it out after it didn't work out so well.
[03:04:23] <BaronVladimirHar> What is Google securing for you if you search over HTTPS?
[03:04:44] <BaronVladimirHar> They store it and share it with advertisers and government.
[03:04:59] <Bradipo> Well, HTTPS is dual-purpose.  There's encryption, and trust.
[03:05:23] <BaronVladimirHar> Yeah, but idiots are being spoon fed this nonsense that if a padlock shows up in their browser, it's good.
[03:05:25] <Bradipo> But you have apoint about them reselling the search data to States.

[07:43:54] <BaronVladimirHar> The only reason Opera 12 with Presto went on for so long is Opera came back and quietly bumped it, Windows only.
[07:44:03] <ede> i have an old netsurf installed, guess what
[07:44:10] <BaronVladimirHar> With new certificates and some patches.
[07:44:16] <ede> it can't even display things like youtube profiles properly
[07:44:35] <ede> you know how video lists are implemented in them?
[07:44:46] <BaronVladimirHar> No, GAFAM has made the web so awful that nobody can write an independent browser engine and have the majority of sites work.
[07:44:52] <ede> looks like a table, works like a table, ain't a table
[07:45:05] <ede> it's a list with just some modern css on it

[07:45:59] <ede> w/e GAFAM is
[07:46:13] <BaronVladimirHar> It's far less of a disaster than opening CNN or NPR.
[07:46:25] <ede> isn't this the crap pushed by l0de?
[07:46:29] <BaronVladimirHar> When I open CNN, my ad blocker says it blocked over 70 items.
[07:46:36] <ede> yeah so waht
[07:46:38] <BaronVladimirHar> And it still takes 12 MB to load the main page.
[07:46:53] <ede> it's CNN's idea to put every bit of it into their sites
[07:47:10] <ede> not a question of old or new browsers or standards
[07:47:13] <BaronVladimirHar> Yes, this is every bit as painful as loading CNN over dial up in 1999 was.
[07:47:28] <BaronVladimirHar> Only this is broadband, and with an ad blocker set to kill everything even mildly annoying.
[07:47:41] <ede> don't blame browsers or the web for stupid webdesigners
[07:47:52] <ede> you don't have to tell me

[07:48:23] <BaronVladimirHar> They pretty much made the W3C irrelevant and now they dictate.
[07:48:32] <BaronVladimirHar> I don't use Twitter.
[07:48:37] <ede> cnn is media and media websites are amongst the worst
[07:48:48] <BaronVladimirHar> It's a pile of Javashit and it wants me to log in to see what the replies are to people's posts.
[07:49:08] <ede> the only one which are worse are porn and gambling sites, you know, the ones you'd expect to rip you off
[07:49:22] <ede> and ofc all the ads they inject everywhere
[07:49:36] <BaronVladimirHar> Brendan Eich: "I came here to ruin the web and ban gay marriage, and I'm all out of banning gay marriage!"
[07:49:53] <ede> a lot of the malware comes from them, they just don't care about keeping their scripts or OS safe
[07:50:30] <ede> who again is Eich?
[07:50:45] <BaronVladimirHar> One of the Netscape people that moved over to Mozilla.
[07:50:52] <BaronVladimirHar> Now he's running "Brave".
[07:51:03] <BaronVladimirHar> Netscape was a complete disaster near the end.
[07:51:10] <ede> a lot of what modern web standards have is just useless for most cases
[07:51:13] <BaronVladimirHar> The 4.x series never worked right.
[07:51:24] <BaronVladimirHar> And they were trying to jam through this thing called JavaScript Style Sheets.
[07:51:31] <ede> yeah, i stayed on .72 or w/e for a long time
[07:51:40] <BaronVladimirHar> Then after they had that built-in, the W3C standardized CSS instead.
[07:51:43] <ede> and then they never released 5 and 6 was just, well.
[07:51:53] <BaronVladimirHar> So before it went out, they implemented a CSS to JSSS interpreter.
[07:52:07] <BaronVladimirHar> If you turned off JavaScript, CSS wouldn't work either. That's why.
[07:52:14] <ede> i remember CSS not being available with JS turned off
[07:52:36] <ede> i had no idea why, but it looked just like a totally stupid design decision
[07:52:40] <BaronVladimirHar> Internally, the browser had no idea what CSS was.
[07:52:53] <BaronVladimirHar> It was partially CSS 1 compliant through the translator.
[07:52:58] <ede> like the way to leave the impression that Netscape's scripting language was crucial to the web
[07:53:18] <ede> then it was CSS, now it's the proprietary tagsoup
[07:53:20] <BaronVladimirHar> At the time, it was just a way to implement minor nuisances.
[07:53:27] <ede> just look at the new youtube
[07:53:43] <BaronVladimirHar> Now it's a way you implement malware, bitcoin miners, 20 MB scripts that grab a font...
[07:53:55] <ede> there was a reason why i modified their PREF cookie after restarting the browser
[07:54:17] <BaronVladimirHar> I don't touch Youtube.
[07:54:21] <ede> do you have scripts blocked?
[07:54:38] <BaronVladimirHar> I opened Chrome once on my phone. 5 years later, I opened it again and it still had that page loaded.
[07:54:53] <ede> did you remove the profile?
[07:55:10] <BaronVladimirHar> I just leave it alone.
[07:55:20] <BaronVladimirHar> I disable, remove, or ignore whatever I don't like.
[07:55:31] <BaronVladimirHar> Preferably remove or disable.
[07:55:46] <ede> no answer, ok
[07:55:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Samsung has been getting worse every year.
[07:55:49] <BaronVladimirHar> This is my last one.
[07:56:03] <BaronVladimirHar> Sorry, what profile?
[07:56:11] <ede> my samsung was pretty ok, only T9 was just crap
[07:56:22] <ede> your browser profile for chrome
[07:56:50] <BaronVladimirHar> I had enough of this S20 FE 5G saying I needed OneDrive, so I disabled the built-in Gallery app and downloaded one from F-Droid.
[07:57:00] <BaronVladimirHar> No, I just don't use it.
[07:57:44] <BaronVladimirHar> I never saw any point in trying to make the best of Chrome on Android. Then I'd have to use Chrome on my desktop to sync with it, and Chrome Android doesn't have ad blockers, so I'd need one of those fake VPN apps.
[07:57:48] <BaronVladimirHar> It's just worth it.
[07:58:08] <BaronVladimirHar> *not
[07:58:26] <BaronVladimirHar> A web browser without "content blockers" is useless from the beginning.
[07:59:08] <BaronVladimirHar> I have Bypass Paywalls too as an Unpacked Extension in Vivaldi.
[07:59:12] <ede> so if you don't delete it, why are you surprised it reopens the page you did use years ago? that's how profiles work.
[07:59:16] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox removed it from their addons site.
[07:59:23] <BaronVladimirHar> "Take back the web...." Uh huh
[08:00:08] <BaronVladimirHar> ede: Oh, because Firefox on Android does stupid things.
[08:00:27] <BaronVladimirHar> It tries reloading pages just because you switched to another app for a while.
[08:00:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Which is fantastic when you don't have an internet connection and needed the page. :)
[08:01:26] <BaronVladimirHar> Nobody was using their app on Android, and less and less use it on desktop, so they're doing things that smack of desperation for money now.
[08:01:30] <ede> firefox was too often already like... oh look, chrome/opera has some neat thing... lemme write an addon for it. nice. and a ton of extra features. oh, people like it, let's put it into core. but with less features. so people stop using the addon which then vanishes. some years later they find out people don't use it because the core version is just crap or not visible at all, so... yeah let's remove it.
[08:01:42] <BaronVladimirHar> At some point, they're going to collapse, but the code will still be out there under the MPL.
[08:01:57] <BaronVladimirHar> So maybe Pale Moon can come into its own then.
[08:02:05] <ede> tabs on the left side? nice for widescreens. also you get dozens of tabs before you run out of space.
[08:02:14] <ede> also you can group them nicely.
[08:02:31] <BaronVladimirHar> GeckoView is the worst thing to happen to Firefox Android.
[08:02:54] <BaronVladimirHar> It basically killed off most of the add-ons and made the browser even more pointless and unspectacular.
[08:03:00] <ede> tabgroups (as in that C-S-e thing)? removed because they weren't fine with it. and why? it wasn't implemented the way they would have liked it
[08:03:19] <ede> so instead of FIXING it they just REMOVED it.
[08:03:26] <BaronVladimirHar> Vivaldi lets you do pretty much anything with it.
[08:03:37] <ede> just like VLC with their atrocious broken XML playlist
[08:03:43] <BaronVladimirHar> Sometimes I have hundreds of tabs open and it doesn't slow me down.
[08:03:43] <BaronVladimirHar> Just put them in tab stacks.
[08:04:08] <BaronVladimirHar> Well, Xiph released an open standard for playlists.
[08:04:18] <ede> was the moment when i dropped it for the very last time and i had been waiting for each new release since 0.7
[08:04:21] <BaronVladimirHar> I don't know that anything uses it, but it's a good standard. Very readable.
[08:04:33] <ede> and each new release introduced some new bugs.

[08:06:33] <ede> how do they implement it?
[08:06:38] <BaronVladimirHar> I know people who gave up on Firefox because it stopped supporting Windows XP.
[08:07:01] <ede> they load some JS framework, put the menu structure into some json and let the js do everything else. correct?

[08:07:31] <BaronVladimirHar> I replaced XP with Windows 98 on one system. I hacked around Intel's checks for XP on their drivers, installed KernelEx, and removed IE and the shell update.
[08:07:33] <ede> people should not use XP on the web
[08:07:45] <ede> even less 98
[08:07:45] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox 8 worked on Windows 98 with KernelEx.
[08:08:01] <BaronVladimirHar> Not always correctly, but well enough.
[08:08:43] <BaronVladimirHar> XP is probably worse.
[08:08:50] <ede> i really have no time for this kind of shit
[08:09:01] <BaronVladimirHar> If you configure Windows 98 the way I had it, there wasn't much left.
[08:09:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Stripped to the bone and then graft some NT APIs on top.
[08:09:31] <ede> yeah, 20 years back i used to play with the OS too...
[08:09:40] <BaronVladimirHar> I played Halo 2 on it.
[08:09:45] <BaronVladimirHar> You know, the "Windows Vista exclusive".
[08:10:06] <ede> removed everythign in the suse installation and all i got were about 20 packages
[08:10:22] <BaronVladimirHar> I had to use the "Windows XP" patch, DirectX 9.0c, "Gravemind fix", dummy Games for Windows Live dll that loaded and then unloaded....
[08:10:44] <ede> maybe, just maybe, if i find the time, i'll do this with debian in a vm in the future
[08:10:49] <BaronVladimirHar> I came up with a dummy Games for Windows Live dll out of sheer frustration.
[08:11:05] <BaronVladimirHar> I was trying to get Fallout 3 working a long time ago and the version on the DVD checked the dll to see if it loaded.
[08:11:23] <BaronVladimirHar> So I made one that was a stub. "Yeah I loaded!" exits. Game goes on.
[08:11:46] <BaronVladimirHar> At the time I was trying to make it work in Wine.
[08:11:50] *** Joins: qjsgkem_ (bernhard@p54b0ff6c.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[08:12:21] <BaronVladimirHar> And it was so stupid, because the DLL was there to hook into a "Games Explorer" from Vista, which doesn't even exist anymore.
[08:13:06] <BaronVladimirHar> That's Microsoft for you. Just throw more stupid crap into the pile. Very robust!
[08:13:31] <BaronVladimirHar> You don't even want to see my Wine prefixes.

[08:15:59] <BaronVladimirHar> They got so bad it was to the point where even internally they had no idea what depended on what anymore. It was all just "Windows".
[08:16:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Windows 98 wasn't made to have any "advanced security". It wasn't even really an operating system.
[08:16:53] <BaronVladimirHar> It was a glorified DOS Extender.

[08:22:30] <BaronVladimirHar> It just only ever gets bigger. It's crazy. Each one is worse than the last.
[08:22:51] <BaronVladimirHar> They are clearly too incompetent and overwhelmed to properly audit, debug, and profile their code.

[08:33:33] <BaronVladimirHar> I got 98 down to less than 100 MB.
[08:33:53] <BaronVladimirHar> It's hard to believe nowadays, when the true on-disk footprint of Windows 10 and 11 can't even be calculated.
[08:34:12] <BaronVladimirHar> It's definitely over 100 GB, but they use NTFS Compression and other tricks, but then they still spew crap all over the disk.
[08:35:02] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla's pals at Microsoft, who can't even figure out that a fully featured modern OS with all the bells and whistles you could ever want shouldn't be 6% that size.
[08:35:56] <BaronVladimirHar> <ede> "it runs better on most standard..." <- Every browser runs better on my Tiger Lake i7 laptop on Debian 11 than they did on Windows 10.
[08:36:20] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft designed the entire thing wrong from the start, in an age where SMP was an after thought at best, and nobody was doing SMT either.
[08:37:17] <BaronVladimirHar> Windows still can't scale to even 64 CPUs or 32 physical with hyperthreading without totally falling apart.
[08:37:27] <BaronVladimirHar> Linux can address....thousands? Efficiently.
[08:37:56] <BaronVladimirHar> If Windows goes on very much longer, commodity desktop processors are going to be feeling the pinch.
[08:38:08] <ede> edge cases aren't really the things to take care of
[08:38:24] <BaronVladimirHar> You can already buy desktop CPUs like that, they're just expensive.
[08:38:28] <BaronVladimirHar> In 5-10 years, they won't be.
[08:38:35] <ede> they will
[08:38:57] <ede> prices go up whenever they find an excuse to raise them
[08:39:25] <ede> and right now we have delivery chain issues and the good old ressource problems for years
[08:39:49] <BaronVladimirHar> It amazes me how no amount of CPU progress can ever keep up with Windows bloat.
[08:39:55] <ede> where are the 8GHz CPUs?
[08:39:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Or additional RAM.
[08:40:04] <ede> or even 20?
[08:40:08] <BaronVladimirHar> It always finds a way to squander it so Intel can sell new things.
[08:40:32] <BaronVladimirHar> Clock speed isn't the most important part of the equation.
[08:40:52] <BaronVladimirHar> That's been hovering in the same neighborhood for 15 years now, but CPUs are many times faster.
[08:40:54] <ede> most people also don't like to spend the money they make in a month or to on a machine they'll have to replace every 2 years
[08:41:06] <ede> nerds to this, but not the others
[08:41:21] <BaronVladimirHar> I buy a new laptop now and then.
[08:41:32] <BaronVladimirHar> With GNU/Linux, they're still going strong 5 years later.
[08:41:44] <BaronVladimirHar> 12-13 years in, the hardware fails.
[08:41:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Then you buy another laptop.
[08:42:25] <BaronVladimirHar> People don't know how long they last because Apple and Microsoft cut them off at the knees with software, and Mozilla is waiting in the wings to help out.
[08:43:23] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft and Apple push twice as many upgrades with this formula.
[08:43:51] <BaronVladimirHar> At 3 years it should be running like shit, at 4-5 it won't get security updates, and then a year after that, you can't run the latest Firefox.
[08:44:30] <BaronVladimirHar> A company like Mozilla or Google could still support Windows XP, or Mac OS 10.5, or whatever.
[08:44:35] <BaronVladimirHar> They choose not to do it.
[08:44:47] <BaronVladimirHar> Big Tech is incestuous like that.
[08:45:02] <BaronVladimirHar> They help each other carry out their devious schemes.
[08:45:27] <BaronVladimirHar> Cameron Kaiser kept a fork of Mozilla running on Classic Mac OS and obsolete PowerPC Macs with OS X for many years.
[08:45:35] <BaronVladimirHar> It was called Classilla.
[08:45:51] <BaronVladimirHar> If one guy can keep it working okayish, an entire company could maintain it well.
[08:46:44] <BaronVladimirHar> But they irresponsibly abandon users on working hardware there's nothing wrong with.
[08:46:48] <BaronVladimirHar> So that Apple can destroy the planet with e-waste.
[08:47:23] <BaronVladimirHar> The browser may not stop working, but CVEs will pile up as they are discovered, unfixed, and the experience will degrade as teh Web platform gets worse, and that browser can't run it.

[14:42:29] <BaronVladimirHar> GitHub is counterproductive.
[14:42:45] <BaronVladimirHar> It basically takes something open and decentralized and turns it into another Bitkeeper.
[14:43:20] <BaronVladimirHar> It recreates the problems that Git was designed to solve.
[14:44:02] <BaronVladimirHar> If you're not maintaining numerous mirrors of not only the code, but the commit history, then you're a fool. If you only have code in GitHub, you're a fool.
[14:44:48] <BaronVladimirHar> With the push of a button, they can (and sometimes DO) nuke your code, your commit history, everything.
[14:45:17] <BaronVladimirHar> But not only the DMCA is a threat, with bogus takedowns unpunished a lot of these outfits pretty much just lie, and Microsoft goes with it.
[14:46:13] <BaronVladimirHar> Rather, Microsoft itself is the threat, because when they realize that people are fleeing them, they can also press a button and all of a sudden there's no git clone anymore and the mask comes off, and you see it for what it is.
[14:47:34] <BaronVladimirHar> Also, git is pretty lightweight as long as there aren't a bunch of blobs in your tree that don't compress well.
[14:48:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla is going the way of IBM/Red Hat where the CEO used a Mac and forced them to stop relying on their own infrastucture, which basically hardly ever went down, unscheduled, and pushed it to use Google and AWS, which go down constantly, and for unexplained reasons, and without any clear timeframe about when they'll be running again.
[14:50:57] <BaronVladimirHar> When they switched to AWS for building stuff it went from "Hey build this for me!" Build Server: Sure! to "Pending" three days later.
[14:51:14] <BaronVladimirHar> It's just nasty, it's so nasty. This Clown Computing is filthy stuff.
[14:51:53] <BaronVladimirHar> You can build something on your laptop faster than the build server will get around to it, but then I don't believe you can push it to your COPR.
[14:53:05] <BaronVladimirHar> So I gave up on Fedora. I thought it was ridiculous when Firefox was pushing Clang/LLVM.
[14:54:02] <BaronVladimirHar> It was ridiculous. They claimed it was because GCC 8 "didn't support" their PGO (AKA building the browser to cheat the benchmark suites, not to run real websites).
[14:54:03] <BaronVladimirHar> Of course, two patches got PGO and LTO working again under GCC.
[14:54:39] <BaronVladimirHar> Now I realize it's not because there's anything wrong with GCC, it's because Mozilla is in the camp of the people pushing CLang/LLVM to avoid the GPL and violate the GPL in other areas.
[14:56:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Sony and Apple push it because the GPL 3 has anti-DRM and anti-locked bootloader provisions, and because they don't want to give you software then not be able to sue you for using it, and because nobody defends the GPL license of Linux, but they were getting sued for violating it in other things.
[14:57:19] <BaronVladimirHar>  * Sony and Apple push it because the GPL 3 has anti-DRM and anti-locked bootloader provisions, and because they don't want to give you software then not be able to sue you for using it (patents), and because nobody defends the GPL license of Linux, but they were getting sued for violating it in other things.
[14:57:19] <BaronVladimirHar> Clang doesn't do anything GCC doesn't do, except that Clang outputs buggy compiled code which additionally runs slower and crashes debuggers going over the coredump file.
[14:57:54] <BaronVladimirHar> It's a culture of putting out crappy software because of people hissing and spitting at the GPL.
[14:58:57] <BaronVladimirHar> It's also unbelievable that web browsers are using this considering it no-ops security hardening feature flags, which is doesn't support, so that in case you do use them, it won't obviously fail to build.
[15:00:58] <BaronVladimirHar> LLVM is of limited use, in general. Due to how it operates, it can generate compiled code on-the-fly, which suits it better than anything else out there for compiling shaders for OpenGL/Vulkan....
[15:01:26] <BaronVladimirHar> But that's a whole different monster than trying to compile Firefox.

[15:39:59] <BaronVladimirHar> My point about Clang with Firefox is it actually pushes the security situation in the wrong direction.
[15:40:33] <BaronVladimirHar> Of course, that's a practical concern for everyone, especially on Windows, like it needs any more ways of letting untrusted code plant viruses or something.

[22:04:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft "allows" browsers using Gecko or Chromium (but apparently still excludes Goanna and Webkit?), and this gains you nothing because applications are still not audited by Microsoft for safety (for whatever that's worth....Solyndra, the Exchange Server Hack of March 2021, etc, etc.), and updates are still a mess that's handled (or not) per-program.

[22:10:45] <BaronVladimirHar> One reason why GNU/Linux distros don't include wine-gecko is because it requires non-Free software to build Gecko or Firefox for Windows. In fact, that's why the FSF no longer makes a GNU IceCat for Windows, iirc. If you can't even build something without proprietary software, is it Free Software? It took OpenIndiana so long to get away from Sun's compiler that it stalled out development everywhere else in the tree. They may otherwise
