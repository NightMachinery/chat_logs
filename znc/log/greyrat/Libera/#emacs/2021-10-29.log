[00:20:33] <wgreenhouse> Catie: besides what's already been said, the intent of the no public logging rule is that this space is ephemeral and shouldn't be part of anyone's "permanent record." we can't keep individual users from keeping logs but we ask that history of this channel not be shared outside this channel.
[00:20:33] <wgreenhouse> which can be technologically tricky to fully enforce, given things like hosted IRC bouncers or the Matrix bridge. but it's a social norm

[00:32:17] <XJ8> One thing I like in vi is ability to kill a range of lines very easily like putting in 1,50 to go from the first line to the 50th. How can I accomplish that with emacs?
[00:32:56] <neutral> with elisp
[00:33:34] <Catie> XJ8: you could set your mark at line 1, then goto-line 50 with M-g M-g 50 RET

[00:34:00] <rpav> i rebind it as M-g even
[00:34:21] <rpav> there are in addition to the above a number of navigation packages you can choose from, including ones that have vi-like commands i believe
[00:34:49] <rpav> in emacs it's not "how does the editor let me do this," it's "how do i want to make the editor do this" ;)
[00:35:44] <acdw> neutral omg lol
[00:37:14] <jlf> XJ8: another point to note is that wanting to delete lines 1-50 is usually rarer than, say, wanting to delete a semantic unit like a function, for which you could do C-M-h C-w (mark-defun then kill-region)

[00:52:17] <aidalgol> By message, do you mean a literal string, or a bunch of fields that the local server is helpfully printing in human-readable form?
[00:52:32] <XJ8> I guess doing 'C-SPACE' at the starting line I want to delete, type 'M-g g' to jump to the last line I want to delete, and then hit the delete button is adequate enough though a bit longer than how I'm used to with vi, but it's fine. Maybe I could even automate doing that for batches of different line ranges.
[00:52:34] <thblt> Catie: isn't that 452?
[00:53:55] <thblt> RFC821 says 451 is "Requested action aborted: error in processing"

[07:38:01] <shrysr> it appears tridactyl is vim-like keys. So is vimium. These are browser extensions and vimium atleast doesnt require any extensive setup.

[11:18:09] <ext0l> one big thing would that markdown has no way to associate properties to items/files so you'd have to indent one

[18:57:15] <johnjay> because it crashes with error about cannot find webp header
[18:57:27] <johnjay> and brew doesn't have libwebp. just webp
[18:57:39] <bpalmer> ah. That seems like the sort of thing that configure should detect
[18:57:47] <bpalmer> perhaps worth filing a bug about that?
[18:57:50] <johnjay> maybe it did and i ignored it
[18:57:52] <johnjay> let me see
[18:58:17] <hobo> bpalmer: it seems when I happened to misfire a click  on the echo area it caused that problem.
[18:58:20] <hobo> just figured it out now

[18:58:37] <johnjay> bpalmer: also isn't it the programmers' responsibility if it does say you don't have lib xyz?
[18:59:00] <johnjay> or is it supposed to say rerun configure with the relevant feature disabled?

[20:59:14] <lispmacs[work]> hi. yesterday somebody was kind enough to teach me how to add a key-definition in my browse-kill-ring-mode-map (for the browse-kill-ring extension). However, I am having a problem where my .emacs crashes because the browse-kill-ring-mode-map variable is not defined until the first time I run M-x browse-kill-ring during a session (which is of course always after I've started emacs)
[20:59:40] <johnjay> is this that browse-kill-ring package again from melpa
[21:00:30] <lispmacs[work]> johnjay: I install it through Guix package manager, but this is the home page: https://github.com/browse-kill-ring/browse-kill-ring
[21:00:44] <johnjay> ah ok it is in melpa
[21:00:55] <bpalmer> lispmacs[work]: I suspect when you write "crash" you just mean that it shows an error and stops loading the rest of your configuration, not that the program completely crashes?
[21:01:04] *** Joins: ueberall (ueberall_l@user/ueberall)
[21:01:28] <lispmacs[work]> bpalmer: correct, yes
[21:01:44] <bpalmer> lispmacs[work]: assuming so, this is a standard issue of load order; you want to insert something into browse-kill-ring-mode-map after browse-kill-ring has been loaded. You can do that with (with-eval-after-load "browse-kill-ring" (define-key browse-kill-ring-mode-map ...))
[21:02:28] <lispmacs[work]> bpalmer: okay, thanks, I will try that
[21:02:40] *** Quits: lispmacs[work] (~lispmacs@fsf/member/lispmacs) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:02:48] <bpalmer> with-eval-after-load takes the name of a library to load; if it's already loaded, it immediately evaluates the rest; if not, it waits until that library is loaded and then evaluates the rest.

[21:17:21] <Bayes> grym uhmm I'd be going thru them and run computations based on them, but after I used them once or twice I don't need to access them often I hope

[21:19:47] <Bayes> grym maybe I wasn't clear, I know the format for those files (those are all R objects), but I'm thinking how to organize the files
[21:19:54] <grym> Bayes: i am too 
[21:20:16] <grym> files on disk and blobs in a table are not very different 
[21:21:13] <grym> you don't need to use their schema, you can have like a name, a bitmask, and a blob or something 
[21:21:19] <grym> should make queries quick 
[21:21:25] <Bayes> so you're thinking of a sqlite db holding the file content as blobs and indexed by i, j, etc ?
[21:21:34] <grym> yeah
[21:21:44] <Bayes> and then I'm like "I want all with i = 1 and j < 5", pull the records and that's it
[21:22:14] <Bayes> that feels like a more integrated way of having all the files on the disk plus a lookup table, possibly a csv file since that's what people use here :/

[22:52:48] <grym> oh? 
[22:52:54] <thblt> acdw: they're really not complicated, but their format (a sorted list of words, plus an header with the total word count) doesn't play well with basic merge tools.
[22:53:19] <thblt> If you add one word on a one side and two on the other, git is all confused because the headers have different word counts.
