[01:38:51] <secbot> ^ Quantum key distribution is a secure communication method which implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can...
[01:38:55] <JudyRiuliani> and
[01:39:37] <JudyRiuliani> Basically using optical links you entangle photons and send them through
[01:39:49] <JudyRiuliani> If any sniffing occurs, data is mangled, IIRC
[01:40:14] <JudyRiuliani> So post supremacy will be quantum cryptography, and no longer based on classical mathematics

[01:43:49] <JudyRiuliani> The sender transmits photons through a filter (or polarizer) which randomly gives them one of four possible polarizations and bit designations: Vertical (One bit), Horizontal (Zero bit), 45 degree right (One bit), or 45 degree left (Zero bit)
[01:43:53] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[01:44:17] <JudyRiuliani> The photons travel to a receiver, which uses two beam splitters (horizontal/vertical and diagonal) to “read” the polarization of each photon. The receiver does not know which beam splitter to use for each photon and has to guess which one to use.
[01:44:26] *** Joins: rez (~rez@71-222-29-36.lsv2.qwest.net)
[01:44:52] <JudyRiuliani> Once the stream of photons has been sent, the receiver tells the sender which beam splitter was used for each of the photons in the sequence they were sent, and the sender compares that information with the sequence of polarizers used to send the key. The photons that were read using the wrong beam splitter are discarded, and the resulting sequence of bits becomes the key.
[01:45:05] *** Quits: rez (~rez@71-222-29-36.lsv2.qwest.net) (Client Quit)
[01:45:08] <JudyRiuliani> If the photon is read or copied in any way by an eavesdropper, the photon’s state will change.  The change will be detected by the endpoints. In other words, this means you cannot read the photon and forward it on or make a copy of it without being detected.
[01:45:16] <JudyRiuliani> No more MITM maybe?
[01:45:23] *** Joins: rez (~rez@user/rez)
[01:45:53] <JudyRiuliani> If an eavesdropper, named Eve, tries to listen in on the conversation, she has to read each photon to read the secret. Then she must pass that photon on to Bob. By reading the photon, Eve alters the photon’s quantum state, which introduces errors into the quantum key.
[01:46:18] <JudyRiuliani> This alerts Alice and Bob that someone is listening and the key has been compromised, so they discard the key. Alice has to send Bob a new key that isn’t compromised, and then Bob can use that key to read the secret.
[01:46:30] <Blondie101010> like anything, there could always be implementation bugs, even if the technology is reliable

[22:53:57] <Hash> What do you think of this cert?
[22:55:03] <Hash> The SSCP is considered relatively a slightly harder certificate to pass yet not a well known certification, as its elder brother the CISSP is always looming over.
[22:56:07] <Hash> To qualify for SSCP certification, candidates must pass the exam and have at least one year of cumulative, paid work experience in one or more of the seven domains of the (ISC)² SSCP Common Body of Knowledge.
[22:56:31] <Hash> This and CISSP of 5 years work exp I quality in multiple domains

[23:20:08] <catbeard> there's also the consideration of GDPR, such that we're only sending the links off to be scanned, and other information (PII) in the spreadsheets doesn't leave where it's at, this way we don't have to add any data processors

[23:38:30] <Hash> catbeard: I was goingi to suggesgt last resort, js extension you can make yourself in sheets plugins/addons whatever, and use the api to scan each link
[23:38:53] <Hash> And google docs addons by third parties might have such a service
[23:39:42] <Hash> going to have to somehow get list of urls in js from the sheet, so may need a js based sheet parser
[23:39:49] <Hash> extract all urls, run against a checker.
[23:40:14] <Hash> that's what a third party addon will also do. No other way around as google doesn't support actual text content scanning (malicious urls in text content)
[23:40:26] <Hash> So this is something you'd have to write perhaps
