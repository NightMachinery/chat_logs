[01:40:37] <oriba> ok
[01:41:25] <oriba> I had thought about being more verbose on the err-messages, but then thought about the language issue and has just ised as it was in mutt_parse_hook()
[01:42:00] <oriba> I generally would tend to be more specific, so that the user gets hints to what was wrong
[01:42:30] <oriba> but mayxbe it's better for now just to do the new parsers first
[01:43:02] <oriba> and optimize the message later (-> maybe starting a discussion on github?)

[02:18:43] <flatcap> yes, the error/warning messages all need to be translated
[02:18:59] <flatcap> so more detail would be nice, but it'd be a pain for the translators
[02:19:27] <flatcap> it's a tricky balance

[03:22:01] <oriba> if the documentation would be updated regularly (hint, hint ;-)) an error message could also mention an url to the corresponding part of the documentation (which then afaik is only in english)
[03:24:05] <flatcap> I updated the docs a few hours ago.  good enough?
[03:24:09] <flatcap> ;-)
[03:27:24] <flatcap> hmm... the error message generally only has one line, so it'd have to be a short url
[03:27:51] <flatcap> the message window can be resized, but that's currently a manual thing
[03:28:03] <oriba> ok, neomutt needs an url-shortener module
[03:28:34] <oriba> I got the error messages to stdout
[03:28:37] <oriba> or stderr
[03:29:15] <oriba> at least it looked like that
[03:29:43] *** Quits: plastico (~plastico@neomutt/plastico) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[03:30:02] <flatcap> oh?
[03:31:05] <oriba> just checked it.
[03:31:13] <oriba> it's not stdout and not stderr
[03:31:19] <oriba> but it looks like that
[03:31:54] <oriba> screen did not changed to expect that it is ncurses
[03:32:49] <flatcap> it should be displayed in the MessageWindow (1 liner at the bottom of the screen)
[03:34:03] <flatcap> coloured by `color warning fg bg`
[03:36:13] <oriba> for each broken charhook I get one line with warning, filename, line and the message I wrote into the err-buffer.
[03:36:39] <oriba> and the last line says "source: 2 warnings in <rc-file-name>"
[03:36:53] <oriba> for my two broken charset-hooks
[03:37:17] <oriba> and then: "Press any key to continue..."

[03:41:07] <flatcap> a couple of points about the code
[03:41:40] <flatcap> please can you run clang-format on the files you've changed (the repo has the config file)
[03:41:54] <flatcap> can you remove the charset code from mutt_parse_hook()
[03:46:04] <aplund> I'm getting a heap of errors in icommands.c when compiling the current git master.
[03:48:46] <flatcap> oh.  please can you pastebin them
[03:49:17] <flatcap> I recently culled a LOT of #includes, but all my test builds still worked
[03:50:02] <flatcap> oh. do you have any --debug-* options enabled?
[03:53:08] <oriba> not sure what you mean with the debug options
[03:53:14] <oriba> configure?
[03:53:36] <oriba> I used -d 1 for my tests

[03:54:19] <flatcap> oriba: sorry, I was talking aplund 
[03:54:46] <flatcap> yes, ./configure has a bunch of --debug options.
[03:55:23] <oriba> what is needed?
[03:56:25] <flatcap> none is needed, but I often use debug-graphviz, -color, -window

[04:00:31] <oriba> do I have to touch that too?
[04:01:19] * flatcap tries to remember the syntax for unhook

[04:19:05] <flatcap> great
[04:20:10] <flatcap> do you have `clang-format` installed? (package is called clang-tools-extra on fedora)
[04:20:23] <oriba> I can call that, tried it
[04:21:00] <oriba> what to do?
[04:22:07] <flatcap> clang-format -i hook.c mutt_commands.c
[04:22:34] <oriba> hook.h also?
[04:23:02] <flatcap> no...
[04:23:25] <flatcap> all C files must be formatted by cf (to avoid arguments :-)
[04:23:30] <oriba> it changed my layout
[04:23:41] <flatcap> yes, that's its job
[04:24:00] <flatcap> but in header files, some whitespace is helpful for humans

[04:29:26] <oriba> ok, tests running again
[04:30:12] <oriba> two people suggested for the review on GitHub
[04:30:18] <oriba> you already looked at the code.
[04:30:40] <oriba> so I can just ignore that suggestion and you just do it, right?
[04:31:02] <oriba> or is it necessarry to formally request the review?
[04:31:16] <flatcap> yes.  github tries to figure out who'd be best to review the code based on who edited it most recently
[04:31:50] <flatcap> it's fine. gahr or I will review everything
[04:33:08] <flatcap> couple of minor things: the comments for the new functions refer to mutt_parse_hook
[04:33:11] <oriba> gahr was not suggested. ngortheone was usggested
[04:33:25] <flatcap> and the description part, after, could be made specific now
[04:34:15] <oriba> oh... forgot to chnage that
[04:34:23] <oriba> copy&paste... :(
[04:34:45] <flatcap> there is a .github/CODEOWNERS file.  it used to work by pointing to a team.  I'll try to fix that
[04:35:26] <oriba> I added myself directly in the code. wrong?
[04:35:58] <oriba> do you mean "Parse the 'hook' family of commands" must be more specific?
[04:37:43] <flatcap> yes, that could mention charset-hook, as the function is now specific
[04:37:56] <oriba> ok
[04:37:59] <flatcap> thanks
[04:38:23] <flatcap> some comments are pretty simple, but it's good to have 100% coverage
[04:38:35] <oriba> "This is used by ..." can be removed then, if it's already more specific in the line above
[04:38:52] <oriba> of course, things must be correct, agrreing completely

[13:19:53] <jindraj> how you're doing, flatcap?
[13:21:18] <flatcap> good thanks.  I've completed some mega-refactoring, which looks good and simplifies the code
[13:21:50] * flatcap mutters, "and screws up the pager" ;-)

[13:22:42] *** Joins: noex (~null@user/noex)
[13:22:55] <jindraj> also good. thanks for asking. I've posted cs_CZ translation today.
[13:24:32] <flatcap> yes, I saw. there are two fuzzy left, do you have questions?
[13:25:54] <jindraj> I would keep it there and I'll revisit them later. 
[13:26:06] <flatcap> ok, cool
[13:28:48] <jindraj> I need to to think about the translation and context. to be honest I hate the czech translation. Some neomutt/e-mail terms are translated, while others are not. Maybe there's a mix of a single term being translated somewhere and not elsewhere. I don't like the translated terms but keeping originls sounds weird also… 
[13:31:31] <flatcap> are there any other Czech users around?  user ml perhaps?
[13:31:43] <flatcap> take a poll
[13:32:31] <flatcap> or take look at thunderbird's translations (or similar) for ideas
[13:34:12] <flatcap> alas it's one of the few areas in neomutt that I can't help with :-)
[13:35:42] <gtms> I am Czech user.

[16:18:32] <flatcap> the pager's a complete ****-up (not my fault :-)
[16:19:16] <flatcap> for 43 different functions, the pager closes, lets the index do the work, then reopens (hopefully at the same place)

[16:22:27] <flatcap> yes, thanks

[16:45:13] <DebXWoody> I also updated my second laptop. There I'm using notmuch - looks good. I think there was an issue with message status N/O before. This looks fine now. Also colors are still fine.
[16:45:14] <gahr> morning
[16:47:07] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[16:49:06] <flatcap> I've updated the web guide (long overdue) and added some extra notes to the config defs:
[16:49:17] <flatcap> Old name:   https://neomutt.org/guide/reference#pager-skip-quoted-context
[16:49:19] <flatcap> Renamed:    https://neomutt.org/guide/reference#smime-self-encrypt-as
[16:49:21] <flatcap> Deprecated: https://neomutt.org/guide/reference#escape
[16:50:10] <flatcap> it was a manual job, this time, but all the data's there in the mutt_config.c etc
[16:53:24] <gahr> nice
[16:54:11] <flatcap> thanks
[16:55:10] <flatcap> wanna laugh?  see the magic pager?
[16:55:52] <flatcap> open an email, 'c' to change folder, then '=' and the pager vanishes
[16:56:29] <gahr> haha
[16:56:31] <gahr> dafuw?
[16:57:22] <flatcap> it's the pager returning to let the index service its functions
[16:57:39] <flatcap> only now, it's visible because I'm repainting correctly
[16:58:48] <gahr> so it's correct?
[16:59:51] <flatcap> visually, yes.  but the behaviour needs fixing
[17:00:19] <flatcap> hopefully, I can use the index function dispatcher from the pager,
[17:00:28] <flatcap> so the pager will remain visible
[17:00:42] <flatcap> no more returning to the index
[17:01:40] <flatcap> i've just got to test each of the 43 functions that are delegated

[17:36:56] <gahr> flatcap: can you think of a reason why this was done with a check on pre_t and post_t instead of checking that select returned 0?
[17:37:02] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/ef4b2fc977591a6376fd749d05f5e3724fbca6a1#diff-573f781325de93ae9d68d5f8b414f3785bc02cda6362d1b451d5ad131dfdd3a1R398-R420
[17:39:10] <gahr> oh.. 
[17:39:25] <gahr> my man select says "If the time limit expires, select() returns 0.", but I don't see that in POSIX
[17:39:29] <gahr> perhaps it's a bsd extension?
[17:40:12] <gahr> linux says "The return value may be zero if the timeout expired before any file descriptors became ready.
[17:40:24] <gahr> so probably that's not to be relied upon in general
[17:43:52] * flatcap looks ...
[17:44:46] <gahr> nah it's fine, I think I just assume all select() worked the same :)

[20:20:50] <jotoho> neomutt really seems to love getting stuck for me. While using it and hoping for #3313 to happen again, I tried to go through my folders to look at new emails. When I tried to open a folder, it just got stuck with the message "Sortiere Mailbox..." (in english: "sorting mailbox...")
[20:20:51] <neo-bot> Issue by @jotoho "NeoMutt gets stuck when exiting while closing IMAP connection": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3313
[20:23:03] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:26:01] <jotoho> This isn't quite the same issue (I think) but I made a backtrace anyway: https://pastebin.com/GdnREvq7 (I haven't recompiled with debug symbols yet)
[20:26:44] <gahr> hi jotoho 
[20:26:48] <jotoho> hi gahr
[20:29:40] <gahr> mh so it's waiting for data to come back from the SSL socket
[20:29:57] <jotoho> After what I think were multiple minutes the sorting mailbox message just disappeared.
[20:30:03] <jotoho> let me check if the client works again
[20:30:22] <gahr> this was the backtrace of the hangup you got while sorting the mailbox?
[20:30:31] <gahr> ok I see
[20:30:39] <jotoho> Yup, it's usable again. Strange
[20:31:06] <jotoho> I wasn't sorting the mailbox. I just opened it. NeoMutt must have been sorting for initially displaying the mails
[20:31:46] <jotoho> When NeoMutt finally got unstuck, I was still on the mailbox selection screen. It must have cancelled the operation
[20:34:38] <jotoho> The folder in question even only had one email inside. Technically speaking, the sorting probably wasn't even needed. (Though I suspect that if SSL was involved, the sorting itself had nothing to do with it getting stuck)
[20:44:24] <jotoho> I just attempted to rebuild with debug symbols by adding the argument to make in the PKGBUILD script but the resulting neomutt still does not seem to contain debug symbols. Maybe trying to compile and install via makepkg is messing things up.
[20:45:49] <jotoho> And now my recompiled neomutt froze so completely that even Ctrl+C does nothing. Great.
[20:46:09] <jotoho> Or maybe that's gdb?
[20:46:38] <jotoho> Apparently attaching a process via gdb freezes it. Good to know.
[20:47:57] <flatcap> yes, it stops the process, then you can step through.  when you disconnect gdb, the process is set running again
[20:48:43] <jotoho> flatcap: This is my first time using gdb, so I'm just fumbling my way through
[20:50:05] <gahr> thanks jotoho I appreciate the effort :)
[20:50:36] <gahr> I need to run now, I'll read the backlog tomorrow in case you find anything
[20:51:18] <jotoho> gahr: okay. thanks!

[21:24:12] <jotoho> By the way: I noticed that NeoMutt unfroze from the "sorting mailbox..." thing because my motherboard speaker made a noise when it happened.
