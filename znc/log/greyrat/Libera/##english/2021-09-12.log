[03:13:41] <soulisson> huf, thanks a lot. I easily get confused, I found the first meaning somewhere. Sorry about the questions.
[03:13:54] <LjL> i don't think the first meaning is so out there
[03:14:23] <LjL> i'd say it could be either and really the way English tends to just juxtapose nouns like "data"+"structure" is less specific than the way, say, French does with "de" or other prepositions
[03:14:25] <huf> it's not so out there but it aint it
[03:14:43] <huf> yeah but this isnt about grammar
[03:14:48] <LjL> a data structure in computer science is a *way* to store data
[03:14:54] <huf> just fucking have a look at what data structure actually means
[03:14:58] <LjL> so you can talk about data structures even when you don't have any data in them quite yet
[03:15:05] <LjL> huf, wow, just "fucking" calm down
[03:15:11] <LjL> i know what it means
[03:15:17] <huf> and it doesnt mean a schema
[03:15:26] <LjL> yeah because it's not a DB
[03:15:32] <huf> eh?
[03:15:41] <LjL> a linked list doesn't contain any data while i'm just talking about it, it's a way to store data
[03:15:53] <soulisson> LjL, what do you mean by "I don't think the first meaning is so out there"?
[03:16:09] <LjL> soulisson, i mean that it doesn't really matter whether it's the first or the second, because both are accurate enough
[03:16:14] <LjL> huf clearly disagrees
[03:16:18] <LjL> he also randomly insults people, though

[23:06:38] <hoglahoo> My apologies
[23:06:46] <rapier> apologies accepted
[23:06:49] <Losher> darsie: your use of 'peril' above is perfect
[23:07:16] <darsie> ok
[23:07:22] <darsie> It's a quote.
[23:07:23] <Losher> rapier: in my dialect, the past tense of broadcast is still broadcast (same with the verb cast)
[23:08:17] <rapier> i'm so sorry. i didn't know that.
[23:08:34] <rapier> new thing to learn: broadcast is an irregular verb 
[23:09:23] <hoglahoo> I use it that way as well.  It makes sense to me because “cast” itself is also used that way
[23:09:42] <Losher> darsie: it's hard to say if it's excessive without knowing what happens if the thermal conductivity is bad e.g. if it overheats and catches fire, that would definitely fit the notion of "perilous"
[23:10:24] <Losher> hoglahoo: thank you for confirming. I wasn't sure if it was a personal idiosyncracy or not.
[23:10:29] <darsie> Yeah. More likely it would overheat, fizzle, and then interrupt the circuit.
