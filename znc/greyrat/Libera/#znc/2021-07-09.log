[00:00:47] <MetaNova> 2) one of the advantages (there are several) of SASL auth over traditional nickserv auth is that SASL auth _does not care_ what nick you're using, whereas out of the box, the *nickserv module does
[00:01:21] <MetaNova> 2) [cont] meaning, if you're using a nick which is not grouped to your registered nickserv account, *nickserv will fail to identify you
[00:02:30] <MetaNova> 3) to fix this, I personally recommend (where SASL auth is not available, anyway) that you hard-code your registered nick as part of the *nickserv command, so that instead of it trying to do '/msg nickserv identify password' (which may or may not identify you, based on what nick you're currently using) it will always do '/msg nickserv identify yournick yourpass' (which will always work)
[00:03:04] <MetaNova> so, here's how I go about this
[00:03:13] <MetaNova> first, load the nickserv module
[00:03:45] <MetaNova> then, to view the formatting of its existing commands (there should only be one, by default, I think, 'IDENTIFY') do: /msg *nickserv ViewCommands
[00:03:49] <MetaNova> for me that displays:
[00:03:56] <MetaNova> <MetaNova> viewcommands
[00:03:56] <MetaNova> <*nickserv> IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY {password}
[00:05:05] <MetaNova> this means its defined command "IDENTIFY" performs "NICKSERV IDENTIFY {password}" where {password} is a fill-in for what you have defined as your password (/msg *nickserv set YourPasswordHere)
[00:05:10] <MetaNova> now, to fix this, you would use SetCommand
[00:05:35] <MetaNova> example: /msg *nickserv SetCommand IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY MyRegisteredNick {password}
[00:06:40] <MetaNova> in summary: 1) use SASL auth whenever available, 2) if SASL auth is unavailable, then use the *nickserv module, 3) if you must use the *nickserv module to auth, change what is defined as the IDENTIFY command to include your explicit nick so that it works more consistently
[00:06:49] <MetaNova> if you have any further questions let me know
[00:08:22] <Wollino> MetaNova what I was interested in understanding was the syntax to use. instead of the IDENTIFY parameter and the CMD and pattern parameter.
[00:08:58] <MetaNova> /msg *nickserv SetCommand COMMANDNAME COMMAND AND PARAMETERS HERE
[00:09:58] <Wollino> but COMMANDNAME is? can I set others command or ONLY IDENTIFY ?
[00:10:23] <MetaNova> it needs to be a valid NickServ command, /msg nickserv help
[00:10:44] <MetaNova> so other commands you could define, for example, could be GHOST or REGAIN, for instance
[00:11:05] <MetaNova> but whether or not the *nickserv module will ever use GHOST or REGAIN, well, I simply don't know
[00:11:32] <Wollino> ok
[00:11:38] <MetaNova> and since you can't outright tell *nickserv to perform any particular command at will, or define in what order they run, I question if that matters
[00:12:09] <Wollino> ok
[00:12:11] <MetaNova> now, if you were loading *nickserv to speak with a different network which ran a different nickserv and the commands/command structure was different, then it may matter
[00:12:23] <MetaNova> personally, I prefer *perform over *nickserv

[00:12:40] <Wollino> ok
[00:13:10] <MetaNova> since it's a) more configurable, b) you can specify multiple commands to run, in sequence (such as IDENTIFY followed by an automatic REGAIN), and c) you can tell the commands to be ran at any time
[00:13:20] *** Joins: GrantN05 (GrantN05@user/grantn05)
[00:14:03] <MetaNova> [when SASL auth is unavailable, I never use *nickserv, I use *perform: /msg *status loadmod --type=network perform ; /msg *perform add nickserv identify mynick mypass ; /msg *perform add nickserv regain mynick)]
[00:16:30] <Wollino> but... on new freenode... because use this sintax?
[00:18:52] <MetaNova> the new freenode uses Anope, and to the best of knowledge, the syntax for NickServ IDENTIFY is identical for Anope as it is for Atheme (old freenode and libera used/use Atheme)
[00:19:00] <MetaNova> s/of/of my/
[00:19:01] <ZNC-Linker> MetaNova meant: “the new freenode uses Anope, and to the best of my knowledge, the syntax for NickServ IDENTIFY is identical for Anope as it is for Atheme (old freenode and libera used/use Atheme)”
[00:19:40] <MetaNova> I'd encourage you to at least try SASL auth on new freenode
[00:19:50] <MetaNova> /msg *status unloadmod nickserv
[00:19:55] <MetaNova> /msg *status loadmod sasl
[00:20:02] <MetaNova> /msg *sasl set MyNick MyPass
[00:20:06] <MetaNova> /msg *sasl verbose yes
[00:20:10] <MetaNova> /msg *status connect
[00:20:37] <Wollino> verbose why?
[00:21:23] <Casper> So you know whether it failed or not.
[00:27:48] <MetaNova> Wollino: so that the *sasl module will tell you outright whether SASL auth succeeded or failed
[00:28:08] <MetaNova> if it fails with properly-specified nick and password, then the network doesn't support SASL
[00:28:44] <MetaNova> if *sasl has verbose = false, it (can? will?) fail silently
[00:29:14] <MetaNova> thus, if the purpose is testing SASL auth, verbose = true :)
[00:29:54] <Wollino> f tell me that Freenode support SASL

[14:25:55] <jonathanschlink> am using android for irc client.
[14:26:56] <bookworm> it has a maximum setting, you might want to adjust that then
[14:27:12] <jonathanschlink> okay. thank you bookworm 
[14:27:45] <bookworm> by default, autoclear{channel,query}buffer settings are active though and you'll only get the buffer once
[14:27:51] <bookworm> did you mess with that?
[14:28:17] <jonathanschlink> I will try to change. I gotta open it in laptop

[22:29:52] <bookworm> yeah and?
[22:29:53] <mattf> So i filled those 3 variables, my user has read permission of the 3 files (i can cat them)

[22:38:04] <bookworm> got some fancy tls addons that are doing some interesting things to the ciphers?
[22:38:36] <mattf> no i tested from other browsers

[22:41:05] <mattf> this is the config and the file names are the same as in the let's encrypt folder
[22:42:22] <mattf> they are complete, i can cat them as the user im runing znc with, they are the same ones I use on the https server on port 443
[22:43:10] <bookworm> well, did you try with curl / openssl s_client
[22:43:29] <bookworm> they can tell you what the ciphers are
