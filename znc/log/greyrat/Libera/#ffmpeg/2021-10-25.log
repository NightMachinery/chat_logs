[01:52:34] <hyrcanus> hm
[01:53:31] <hyrcanus> you have transparency
[01:53:55] <hyrcanus> think of the gif as a stack of images, transparency will show lower layers
[01:53:59] <BtbN> It just removed the transparency channel
[01:54:10] <BtbN> gif transparency is... weird
[01:55:08] <hyrcanus> if you make each frame what you want to see in that frame, you'll generally get the results you want
[01:55:14] <hyrcanus> no transparent source images
[01:55:34] <hyrcanus> the gif convertor algorithm will usually intelligently not store unchanged pixels
[01:56:01] <BtbN> Is gif really that advanced, with delta compression?
[01:56:06] <hyrcanus> yes
[01:57:17] <T_X> hm, what actually works is doing this before the ffmpeg call (even though it's already been 4096x4096 before): "for i in *.png; do convert "$i" -scale 4096x4096 ${i%.png}-scaled2.png; done"
[01:57:40] <T_X> what does not work is converting the PNGs to BMPs using: for i in *.png; do convert "$i" ${i%.png}-scaled2.bmp; done
[01:57:44] <BtbN> Please paste the complete and uncut output of your ffmpeg command with -v debug
[01:57:59] <BtbN> well yes, if you strip the alpha channel, obviously your transparency will vanish
[01:59:10] <hyrcanus> the next transparent frame won't transparent against the first image.  it will be transparent to the most recent frame.
[01:59:56] <T_X> ffmeg output: https://paste.linuxlounge.net/EPIA
[02:00:00] <hyrcanus> at least that's how the gif encoders usually did it. i can't say for sure with ffmpeg.
[02:00:46] <T_X> do BMPs have these layers, too?
[02:01:32] <BtbN> bmp is the most prehistoric and simple format you can imagine
[02:01:40] <BtbN> pretty much just an array of pixels
[02:01:51] <BtbN> It got a bunch of stuff retro-fitted later, but that's not really normal bmp anymore
[02:02:26] <hyrcanus> some programs support a transparency BMP in ARGB mode with alpha byte.
[02:02:34] <hyrcanus> yea
[02:02:48] <BtbN> Your gif is in "gray" pixel format
[02:02:56] <BtbN> so it got the alpha channel stripped away
[02:03:07] <BtbN> since your input format is super weird with its "ya8"

[02:04:11] <BtbN> Hm, looking at the ffmpeg gif encoder, it does not seem like it supports encoding transparency
[02:04:18] <BtbN> I see no format that looks like it has an alpha channel
[02:05:04] <T_X> is it expected that even if I use the BMPs with ffmpeg to GIF, that the background is there again? I would have expected "convert" to strip this background
[02:05:28] <BtbN> define "strip"
[02:05:41] <BtbN> your editor set the alpha channel on those parts to fully transparent
[02:05:57] <BtbN> so natrually, when you convert it to a non-transparent-capable format, the actual image contents are back

[02:14:53] <T_X> what confuses me, if I convert the PNG to a 64 MB large BMP like this one: https://cloud.hamburg.freifunk.net/f/8e7dbf4425e2436eb1b5/
[02:15:06] <T_X> I still get basically the same, wrong result: https://gifyu.com/image/engS
[02:15:19] <T_X> (sorry, as BMP it gets a bit large...)
[02:15:28] <BtbN> Why would the result be different? You stripped the alpha channel
[02:16:43] <T_X> ok, so this background I'm trying to remove is somehow still in the BMP, even though I don't see it Eye of Gnome?

[02:19:24] <BtbN> What do you _expect_ to be there?
[02:19:38] <BtbN> images are rectangular, your "stripping" is just setting the alpha value to 0
[02:20:46] <hyrcanus> make every frame what you want to see in that frame, and you will get what you want to see
[02:20:59] <hyrcanus> with no transparency
[02:21:19] <BtbN> making a transparent gif needs some more trickery. See link I pasted.
[02:21:28] <hyrcanus> he wants a transparent gif?
[02:21:49] <BtbN> That's the only sensible interpretation I can come up with
[02:22:24] <hyrcanus> that would fit and explain my confusion
[02:23:29] <T_X> yeah, I want a transparent GIF where you only see a rotating sphere in the end
