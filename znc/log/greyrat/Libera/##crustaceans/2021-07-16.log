[00:54:40] <bkero> I really wish they gave it a higher res screen and flexed some of that FidelityFX Supersampling
[00:57:17] <drakonis> well
[00:57:19] <drakonis> gotta have perf
[00:57:25] <drakonis> you can still have those though
[00:57:36] <drakonis> battery life is good i tell ya
[01:08:37] <bkero> FidelityFX is all about perf, yeah
[01:08:45] <bkero> It's AMD's response to nVidia's DLSS
[01:09:04] <bkero> So upscaled lower res game rendering but higher res UI
[01:09:10] <bkero> Best of both worlds
[01:12:35] <gerikson> what's with the graph query database PR push
[01:46:13] <indigo> I thought the graph query DB thread was very insightful tbh
[01:48:14] <indigo> tl;dr for me are that graph dbs are super niche, hard to shard but good for workloads with a ton of joins
[01:51:39] <riv> hard to shard kinda sucks
[01:52:01] <riv> does it cause scaling problems?
[01:52:42] <indigo> I guess it depends on workload; I haven’t really benchmarked them
[01:53:13] <riv> I do feel like graph queries could be a nice expressive useful tool

[07:18:25] <drakonis> wtf
[07:18:56] <quanticle> Did you see the part where his parents are *putting off retirement* for this
[07:19:30] <quanticle> Like... okay, I get it, parents will do *anything* for their children, but uh... have they considered that they're just enabling an incredibly destructive habit?
[07:21:37] <drakonis> probably
[07:34:13] <drakonis> no idea
[07:34:19] <drakonis> but that's still incredibly fucked up shit
[07:35:26] <quanticle> Yeah, my take is that the dude needs rehab and therapy not six figure checks
[07:38:58] <drakonis> who's this guy anyways?
[07:41:33] <quanticle> Some Bay Area dude with rich parents
[07:43:21] <drakonis> ok so its a trust fund baby?

[07:44:42] <Church> I'd still work
[07:44:48] <Church> But man that'd be nice
[07:45:06] <quanticle> Except that I don't think they actually have a trust fund so much as they're just immiserating their parents into poverty when they retire.
[07:46:07] <quanticle> Like, most of that thread is, "Yeah, I wish I had those problems," but the part where his dad tells him he's putting off retirement for that check is actually concerning.

[07:50:55] <drakonis> amazing.
[07:51:09] <quanticle> I'm thinking about getting one
[07:51:21] <quanticle> It looks like a fun little machine
[07:51:58] <quanticle> Like, even if it doesn't pan out (and, let's be real: it's Valve doing hardware -- does it ever pan out) it'll still be fun to have as a platform.
[08:04:55] <drakonis> this one seems like it might not pan out because their approach has much better footing
[08:06:51] <drakonis> the first time around was steam machines and we saw how that one turned out because developers didnt want to go through the effort of porting their games to linux
[08:06:58] <drakonis> which resulted in proton
[08:07:04] <drakonis> steam controller was great
[08:16:51] <quanticle> Might not pan out? Or might pan out?
[08:17:14] <quanticle> Yeah, I use Proton right now
[08:17:39] <quanticle> Works remarkably well, but, then again, I don't play many multiplayer games, so I don't have to worry about compatibility with anti-cheat

[15:59:33] <gerikson> not gonna lie, I'm mildly interested in the Steam Deck
[15:59:47] <gerikson> (or "Steam Desk" as someone submitted to HN)
[16:04:20] <riv> apparently its based on arch linux
[16:10:05] <gerikson> yeah
[16:31:54] <prussian> so wait, it's just a laptop, but with some handheldisms instead of a keyboard / touchpad?
[16:32:03] <prussian> sounds cool I guess.
[16:32:45] <Xe> i may get a 512 GB one
[16:34:40] <prussian> someone mentioned: https://www.gpd.hk/ as well
[16:34:42] <buttsbot> Shenzhen GPD Technology Co., Ltd. - GPD Pocket 2 GPD WIN 2 GPD Pocket GPD WIN GPD XD Plus GamePad Headheld Game Console Video Game Play Mini...
[16:35:03] <prussian> probably not as good for <reason here>
[16:35:44] <gerikson> I'd pay more for Steam integration
[16:36:03] <Xe> prussian: the GPD handhelds have always been kinda sketch lol
[16:40:00] <prussian> wouldn't know. they look like those weird Sony Vios or whatever.
[16:40:23] <prussian> so that's enough for me to evade. just thought it was kind of interesting.
[16:42:55] <prussian> wonder what the battery life will be like.
[16:43:33] <riv> i think they said you can play portal 2 for 4 hours
[16:45:38] <prussian> neat
[16:52:53] <ngoldbaum> if the valve index is a good way to judge the hardware will break a lot
[16:53:04] <ngoldbaum> but at least under warranty the rma process will be nice
[16:53:19] <ngoldbaum> the index controllers are very fragile and break a ton
[16:55:19] <gerikson> I'd liek to tink that the kind of controllers on the Deck are "well  understood"
[16:55:52] <ngoldbaum> you’d think so but google “joycon drift”
[16:56:21] <ngoldbaum> if they want to build the analog stick using cheap plastic parts it doesn’t matter how well understood the mechanics are…
[16:57:31] <gerikson> huh and Nintendo too
[16:57:53] <gerikson> even the rather cheap 3rd party xbox controller I have seem to be holding up
[16:58:01] <gerikson> but I only play ~1hr/day
[16:58:35] <gerikson> but in any case a separate controller is easy to replace
[16:58:46] <gerikson> and no doubt people do so just to get rid of the gunky ones

[21:34:59] <ngoldbaum> no one ever said the people running freenode now are competent
[21:35:04] <ngoldbaum> quite the opposite
[21:35:17] <gerikson> epilys: no reason given
[21:35:30] <gerikson> they probably don't want people outside the inner circle there
[21:35:42] <ngoldbaum> so generally the answer to any question about why they’re doing something technically ludicrous is rank incompetence
[21:36:31] <epilys> positions of power always attract good peeps like that
[21:38:28] <epilys> if it wasn't for #lobste.rs i probably wouldn't be on libera.chat at all
[21:38:35] <epilys> the whole freenode thing left me a sour taste for both sides
[21:40:12] <riv> how come on this side?
[21:41:59] <epilys> that it was possible to sell it on the first place
[21:46:53] <pja> Yesss. Have reserved a Steam Deck.
[21:47:14] <pja> (Steam is unsurprisingly suffering under the load...)
[21:48:02] <martian67|> for steam to suffer under the load there must be a tidal wave of interest
[21:48:27] <martian67|> they are pretty substantially CDNed and all the magic WEBSCALE bullshit, the store rarely dies even for big sales
[21:48:32] <ngoldbaum> if its any consolation epilys it was the act of improving freenode’s governance structure that precipitated the implosion
[21:48:45] <pja> Main Store page is loading about one time in three & the payment system threw 3 errors before I finally got my reservation in.
[21:49:01] <ngoldbaum> pja hope the hardware quality is better than the index
[21:49:06] <martian67|> there must be an absurd amount of people ordering goddamn
[21:49:08] <ngoldbaum> the analog sticks break on the index a lot
[21:49:19] <pja> ngoldbaum: Eh, Valve hardware has been most high quality for me.
[21:49:39] <ngoldbaum> look at the valve index subreddit sometime
[21:49:44] <pja> Going to be a Christmas present to myself if I can wrangle a proper job between now & then.
[21:49:51] <ngoldbaum> otoh they’re good about replacing stuff under warranty
[21:51:17] <ngoldbaum> pja lol https://twitter.com/justinroiland/status/1416084793872113664
[21:51:17] <buttsbot> Twatter - justinroiland - Just attempting one purchase really. Welp. I guess it’s off to eBay with for me. @Steam #SteamDeck https://t.co/8Akc7ceufI
[21:51:29] <ngoldbaum> not even with rick and morty money
[21:53:05] <pja> ngoldbaum: I think it took four tries to get the payment details to go through. Maybe I got lucky!
[21:53:54] <pja> Anyway, if I don’t find gainful employment then I won’t use the reservation & just spend the £4 on some random indie game.
[21:54:52] <ngoldbaum> hope your job search goes well
[21:55:36] <ngoldbaum> if you’re at all interested, remote recuse center is great and their recruiter is legit (although mostly US jobs)
[21:55:50] <ngoldbaum> i can put in a recommendation for you
[21:58:05] <pja> If they have any interesting uk jobs, I’m all ears.
[21:59:31] <pja> (Do you mean recurse centre?)
[21:59:42] <ngoldbaum> recurse center yeah
