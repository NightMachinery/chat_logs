[00:47:18] <jab416171> turns out you can install arch without doing any locale stuff or having an fstab :)
[00:47:33] <NetSysFire> yes, but theres a reason you usually do that
[00:48:03] <jab416171> I accidentally skipped some steps today when doing an install and just realized it heh
[00:48:04] <SysGhost> Things falls back on defaults when "left out".
[00:48:19] <SysGhost> locale for instance falls back to "C"
[00:48:22] <NetSysFire> problem is, sometimes there is no default or some that dont work well

[02:07:40] <Hello71> if your card is 20 years old you're probably SOL
[02:07:56] <wooriedfly3> Hello71: it about 10years old
[02:08:12] <Hello71> you can install xf86-video-ati, it will probably help general performance, but won't affect your opengl version at all
[02:08:28] <wooriedfly3> Hello71: su whats i do to get opengl 4.4
[02:08:51] <Khorne> What is your actual problem in the first place?
[02:08:54] <rcf> Khorne: note that it doesn't always work *well*, there are architectural limitations that drove Intel to backtrack on at least one of their drivers because doing it in hardware turned out to be slower than software rendering for some operations.  
[02:08:56] <dav1d> Hello71, yes it will, the card/driver should support 4.4
[02:09:10] <wooriedfly3> Khorne: i cant run alacritty or hashcat or obs

[05:28:12] <jab416171> what's the implication of not rebuilding systemd-boot on update? just that it breaks secure boot?
[05:28:35] <thrice> rebuilding what?
[05:28:51] <jab416171> running (or not running) `bootctl update`
[05:29:31] <thrice> ah.  Hm, I can't say I've ever run that (and, use s-boot), but don't use secure boot
[05:30:07] <jab416171> wiki says it's "optional"

[05:30:32] <jab416171> guess it doesn't really matter unless there's a bug

[13:39:15] <okhsunrog> ok
[13:39:18] <Foxboron> Don't use poorly maintained distros that litterally scavenge from other distros to somehow accomplish their halfassed goal. That applies to Artix and Obarun.

[13:42:36] <jtgd> I'm not a fan of systemd, but I'm not going to give up Arch for it.
[13:43:38] <Franciman> I think that's a common sentiment. Last year or so, on the debian ML they made a poll to decide whether to support other init systems
[13:43:48] <Franciman> invarious ways
[13:43:55] <Franciman> in the end, only systemd support won
[13:44:00] <Foxboron> That's wrong.
[13:44:23] <Foxboron> Or a misinterpretation of the vote. Nothing inherently changes. Debians main focus is systemd and other inits can be supported if people want to maintain it
[13:44:34] <Franciman> I mean officially supported
[13:44:35] <Foxboron> Thats what was votes in the previous turn as well.
[13:44:36] <Franciman> sorry
[13:44:48] <Foxboron> Franciman: all inits people want to support is officially supported.
[13:44:59] <Franciman> not sure?

[13:45:58] <Franciman> that's a LOT of work
[13:46:02] <Franciman> not worth it
[13:46:09] <Foxboron> That's your definition of "officially supported". I'm sure debian doens't define any such thing
[13:46:29] <Franciman> that's what the vote was about, no?

[18:47:10] <horseface> like in my file manager when i just went into it prior to rebooting, fucking on imgbb to upload an image, i click on /home on the left-panel and it fucking only shows like two of the folder which are present in that directory.

[20:50:04] <Sir_Andrei> I want it to use it on QEMU.
[20:50:12] <Sir_Andrei> To set up tap newtorking.
[20:50:30] <MacGyver> Okay, first piece of advice: look into whether macvtap suits your needs.
[20:50:43] <Sir_Andrei> macvtap. Okay. I'll look into it, thx.
[20:50:44] <MacGyver> But, assuming you do end up with normal tap: what's the issue?

[20:51:16] <MacGyver> I assume qemu throws a particular error at you about being able to set up a network device?

[20:53:05] <Sir_Andrei> This docs.
[20:53:20] <MacGyver> Yeah, I understand, that's how xyproblems happen :)

[20:53:49] <MacGyver> Because I'm *pretty* sure that qemu's bridge helper shells out to brctl.
[20:53:55] <Sir_Andrei> bridge-utils 1.7.1-1
[20:53:59] <MacGyver> And that would be one reason for it to fail.
[20:54:00] <Sir_Andrei> That's the version I have.
[20:54:02] <MacGyver> Okay.
[20:54:05] <MacGyver> So next is
[20:54:10] <MacGyver> !kernelcheck
[20:54:10] <phrik> compare the kernel versions shown in `uname -r` and `pacman -Q linux` and `file /boot/vmlinuz-linux`
[20:54:16] <MacGyver> ^ Are those the same?
[20:54:45] <Sir_Andrei> No, those aren't the same.
[20:54:49] <MacGyver> Then you need to reboot.
[20:54:55] <Sir_Andrei> uname -r throws 5.14.9-arch2-1
[20:54:56] <MacGyver> And after that your problems will magically go away.
[20:55:09] <MacGyver> Long answer:
[20:55:13] <Sir_Andrei> And pacman -Q linux throws linux 5.14.12.arch1-1
[20:55:36] <MacGyver> You do need some module, I think it's technically called net-tuntap.ko or something, and that's not *yet* loaded.
[20:55:49] <MacGyver> You've updated your kernel without rebooting, and Arch doesn't ship versioned kernels.
[20:56:01] <MacGyver> That also means it doesn't ship versioned *modules*.
[20:56:12] <jab416171> reinstalling dmenu fixed it...
[20:56:19] <MacGyver> There simply isn't any module present *to* load for 5.14.9 on your system anymore.
[20:56:36] <MacGyver> You need to reboot to 5.14.12 and then it'll be able to continue.

[21:04:11] <susi> MacGyver: are you using something other than NM for networking?
[21:04:15] <MacGyver> If patches are in any way related to your issue, the more likely cause is that Fedora is actually patching support *into* their kernel.
