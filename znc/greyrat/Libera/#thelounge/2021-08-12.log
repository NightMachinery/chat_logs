[21:35:15] <bookworm> TL isn't really meant to be run as a server on a laptop as you can imagine, not that it should matter much. But the network can and will drop if you roam, question is then if you did that or not

[21:36:23] <xnaas> WiFi can be consistent, but it can also be wildly inconsistent. :P
[21:36:31] <eliocamp> Yeah, it's not. The laptop is on a wired connection. 
[21:36:33] <bookworm> wifi should be fine, assuming your device actually keeps the connection up and doesn't do some fancy battery saving shenanigans
[21:37:31] <bookworm> you could check your network managers (the functionality, not necessarily the program) if there's something in the logs
[21:37:32] <eliocamp> I thought it coudl be related to the screen locking, but a couple of mins before i talked here I was disconnected while working on other stuff and the computer was on. 
[21:38:05] <eliocamp> And a few minutes ago I couldn't send messages to the network some seconds before I saw the timeout. 
[21:38:17] <xnaas> On Windows there's settings for the NIC related to sleeping it for power saving. Might be similar options or features on Debian? (Never looked, tbh)
[21:38:26] <eliocamp> (before I was disconnected, that is)
[21:38:49] <xnaas> I'd also check if your ISP is having and troubles in general. That's the source of most of my problems. :P

[21:41:23] <eliocamp> That could be it (my ISP is shit, as most are), but I don't regularly feel many problem with browsing or other stuff. Besides, today I was connected with another client and I could see the The Lounge's user disconnecting from it, so if that client was still connected, then I suspect something fishy is going on with the lougne. 
[21:41:29] <eliocamp> Perhaps I can just reinstall the whole thing. +
[21:41:55] * xnaas just wanted to narrow down any other external factors
[21:42:30] <eliocamp> Yep., me too. THat's why I tried with another client :)
[21:42:41] <eliocamp> And to another network. 
[21:44:03] <eliocamp> Are there any logs that might be useful? 
[21:46:39] <bookworm> contrary to expectations a reinstall will do exactly nothing, unless you manually messed with the code
[21:47:12] <bookworm> yes, from whatever networkmanager you are using
[21:47:24] <bookworm> that can be literally network-manager or systemd-networkd or whatever
[21:47:29] <bookworm> depends on your setup
[21:50:47] <eliocamp> Seems to be NetworkManager. Thanks, I'll look into that.

[23:44:28] <Activ8> Problems that resolve themselves are great. As long as it doesn’t keep happening.  
[23:45:03] <archpc> I’m a fan or percussive maintenance myself
[23:45:09] <archpc> Of ***
[23:46:35] <Activ8> lol, not sure in this instance elio did that kind of maintenance
