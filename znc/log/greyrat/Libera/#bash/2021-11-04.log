[01:10:03] <uskerine> hi, if I define an environment variable inside a shell script, and then I call a python script inside that shell script, that environment variable does not seem to be there. Which would be the expected behaviour? is there any reason that would confirm this?
[01:10:21] <neshpion> you need to `export` the variable
[01:10:34] <uskerine> I do export FOO="foo"
[01:10:44] <sublim20> what does export actually do
[01:10:55] <sublim20> !export
[01:10:56] <greybot> The environment comprises the subset of variables that are exported, either permanently by the "export" statement or temporarily by prefix assignment. All variables are copied to subshells, but only exported variables are received by other programs; that is the ONLY effect of "export". It's intentionally not possible to modify variables in another process. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Environment
[01:10:58] <neshpion> then i don't know since i don't know how python interacts with the environment
[01:10:58] <phy1729> Does it showup if you run env in the script?
[01:11:27] <uskerine> in which script, in the bash or in the python?
[01:11:30] <sublim20> ahhh, wooledge, always coming through
[01:12:03] <phy1729> bash
[01:12:22] <uskerine> so, which environment does the inner python script has?
[01:12:25] <neshpion> uskerine: is the variable being declared inside a subshell in the script?
[01:12:41] <uskerine> the one of the bash script or the one of the shell that called the script
[01:12:47] <uskerine> no, it is just there in the shell script

[02:40:38] <FreeBDSM> hi. I have a server with a binary in `/usr/local/bin/`, this path in PATH env for both my user and for root. The problem I have is that when I do `sudo thatcommand` I get `sudo: thatcommand: command not found`. If I do `sudo -i` and then `thatcommand` - it, obviously, works. Why is it so?

[14:25:05] <emanuele6> that will result in a single string containing: "bash << EOF stuff here EOF"
[14:25:29] <emanuele6> because quotes get removed
[14:25:47] <emanuele6> and if you have that, you will run that script on the remote
[14:25:59] <Soliton> i'd rather say because quotes don't nest. the next quote closes the previous one.
[14:26:09] <emanuele6> and the remove will see "$f" in a here doc without quotes
[14:26:16] <emanuele6> and expand it on the remote
[14:26:19] <emanuele6> before running the code
[14:26:49] <wwallace> Thanks for all that explanation.
[14:27:43] <emanuele6> so you will have the default shell on the remote expand the here doc to   cd ... || exit   for f in *.zip; do   ls -l ""   done
[14:27:54] <emanuele6> and then send that to the remote bash's stdin
[14:28:28] <selckin> also keep in mind  ##ssh foo bash <<'FOO' $f FOO##  versus  ##ssh foo 'bash <<'FOO' $f FOO'##, where the first will pipe the heredoc over the socket, and the latter will give is a param to execute
[14:28:31] <emanuele6> # echo 'hello << 'HI'stuff here'
[14:28:32] <shbot> emanuele6: hello << HIstuff here
[14:28:46] <selckin> so if you remove the quote before bash it should work
[14:29:18] <emanuele6> selckin: and the quote at the end too..

Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language.

[15:59:54] <emanuele6> joo: you can't just run   vim < /dev/tty | ls   and expect vim to believe it is running in a terminal (it is clearly not because stdout is piped to ls)
[16:00:08] <emanuele6> it's more complex than that
[16:00:18] <Soliton> also kinda difficult to use an editor blind.

[16:05:34] <emanuele6> is it because &0 is only opened for reading with that syntax?
[16:05:36] <Soliton> stdin is opened for writing.
[16:05:57] <emanuele6> you mean for reading?
[16:06:05] <Soliton> and then you copy the fd to stdout which won't work well.
[16:06:06] <joo> not sure them 0 or 2 file descriptors are pointing to dev tty at all anyway ?
[16:06:35] <selckin> on an unrelated note you should probably move to a real scripting language for this, and not a shell one
[16:06:51] <emanuele6> you would need to redirect anyway
[16:06:58] <Soliton> vim </dev/tty >/dev/tty 2>&1  would work though.
[16:07:05] <emanuele6> yeah, i figured
[16:07:35] <emanuele6> i wasn't thinking &0 would only be open for reading, but it makes sense
[16:07:46] <joo> thanks for the help, made my day ! :-)
[16:08:13] <tirnanog> I suppose the real issue is that you can't just duplicate a file descriptor without stipulating that it should be readable, writeable or both.
[16:08:15] <emanuele6> vim 0<>/dev/tty >&0 2>&0 | ls   would also work
[16:08:41] <emanuele6> though &0 would be readable
[16:08:45] <Soliton> yeah, >& doesn't open again it just duplicates the fd.
[16:08:46] <emanuele6> err writable
[16:09:01] <emanuele6> it makes sense
[16:09:13] <kurahaupo> The dup operators don't care whether it's readable or writable
[16:09:44] <kurahaupo> 2>&1 and 2<&1 do exactly the same thing
[16:10:33] <emanuele6> so &0 &1 and &2 would all be readable with   vim 0<>/dev/tty >&0 2>&0 | ls
[16:10:34] <emanuele6> i see
[16:10:48] <tirnanog> yes.
[16:10:51] <emanuele6> yeah, it actually makes a lot of sense

[20:17:48] <cousteau> Hi, I don't know where to ask this.  It's actually a csh question... If I start a heredoc with <<'EOF' in csh then it seems that I have to terminate it with 'EOF' rather than EOF without quotes (but the quotes still mean "don't substitute stuff" like in bash).  Is that correct?

[22:57:37] <Soliton> you could copy stdout if it pointed to the same thing.
[22:57:41] <emanuele6> in that case either  exec 2>&- 2>&1  if stdout is still the terminal or just  exec 2>&- 2> /dev/tty
[22:58:03] <knstn> Can I do 'exec 2> /dev/stderr' later? Or close it instead? Yes, interactive.
[22:58:13] <ormaaj> Normally that's not desirable for the standard streams.

[22:59:23] <greycat> If this is a script, and you want to temporarily redirect stderr (FD 2) somewhere, and then put it back later, you need to store the original location in a different FD.  E.g. FD 3 or 4.
[22:59:47] <greycat> If this is an interactive shell and you've messed up stderr, you can probably fix it with exec 2>/dev/tty
[23:00:01] <greycat> Otherwise, if it's an interactive shell and that didn't work, just close it and open a new terminal.

[23:03:20] <greycat> P.S.  exec 2>/dev/stderr  is most likely a no-op.  Redirecting FD 2 to FD 2.
[23:04:31] <e36freak> yeah
[23:04:57] <e36freak> ideally you want to store it when you do the original exec, as in exec 3>&2 2>/dev/null
[23:05:10] <e36freak> then later restore it with exec 2>&3-
[23:06:29] <emanuele6> exec 2>/dev/stderr  calls open()
[23:06:39] <emanuele6> but it is effectively a no-op, yes

[23:32:00] <greycat> "fd 3 is now stderr" is a semantically challenged statement.  FD 2 is always stderr, by definition.  "exec 3>&2" stores the *current* stderr (FD 2) in FD 3 for safekeeping, so it can be restored later.
