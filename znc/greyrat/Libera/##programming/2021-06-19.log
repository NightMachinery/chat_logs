[02:15:10] <pyzozord> so I just analized disassembly of vi binary compiled with gcc. It kind of looks like it uses about 500 assembly instructions
[02:15:59] <pyzozord> and it has a clear pareto distribution so I'm guessing the top 100 instruction account for 80% of all instructions used
[02:17:52] <pyzozord> the most popular instruction is add, then pretty much move, push, pop, sub, xor, xchg, je, test, imul, pushq, callq, jne
[02:18:17] <pyzozord> i guess even with these instructions I can do a compiler that actually works and make most programs work
[02:19:31] <pyzozord> It kind of looks like (aside of all the optimizer) all compiler does is parsing, creating ast, then visitng ast and producing assembly instructions. I think I can do that
[02:19:47] <webstrand> a lot of the more exotic instructions can be substituted with simpler instructions, at the cost of size and speed
[02:20:53] <pyzozord> I have a gut feeling that all those exotic instructions don't matter in practice and the real speed still comes from cpu cache and simd
[02:21:01] <webstrand> x86 also as boatloads of addressing modes
[02:21:35] <webstrand> so those top 100 instructions may really be more, depending on how many different addressing modes are used
[02:21:57] <pyzozord> Hmm need to investigate those addressing modes indeed
[02:22:10] <webstrand> see MOVfuscator for a sampling of addressing modes available on mov

[02:22:55] <webstrand> in general, you don't need to use anywhere near all of the available instructions. They're only there so that optimizing compilers can create faster code.
[02:23:06] <pyzozord> I think I am willing to be 2x slower then gcc compiled program for the sake of simpler code to maintain if that slowness is in the places that don't matter, and the places that matter are still just optimized with cpu cache and vectorization
[02:23:11] <webstrand> oh and people who do hand assembly
[02:24:08] <pyzozord> not sure how to say it but it feels like there is an oprotunity to write 99% simpler compiler and better language, for lost of speed in places that don't matter anyway
[02:24:38] <pyzozord> so paying with speed in places that don't need to be fast for simplicity everywhere
[02:24:38] <webstrand> a similar technique is used in a few JITs

[02:25:17] <webstrand> simple assembly is emitted, basically template based, to match instructions from the interpreter. It's slower than what the optimizing JIT can generate
[02:25:18] <pyzozord> and the stuff that has to be really fast it still needs that hand optimization for cpu cache, vectorization and maybe even hand written assemlby
[02:25:22] <webstrand> but it's really quick to generate
[02:25:47] <pyzozord> yeah kind of like that

[03:44:58] <elf_fortrez> i think we already have "free as in freedom"
[03:46:27] <pulse> i suppose
[03:47:44] <Krufu> pulse: In which percentile of the top programmers are you?
[03:47:59] <pulse> top 1% of top 1% of course
[03:48:29] <elf_fortrez> i haven't been paid a cent for programming
[03:48:58] <Krufu> pulse: In my experience, most programmers feel they are on the top range... So they assume that if they join a union, and everyone gets a more general treatment, they'll earn much less money, because they'll be paid as the top 50% when they feel they are much higher
[03:49:11] <pulse> i see
[03:49:24] <pulse> yes there's a strong danger of homogenization
[03:49:44] <pulse> and then you have to worry about the weakest links
[03:50:22] *** Quits: chrysanthematic (~chrysanth@user/chrysanthematic) (Quit: chrysanthematic)
[03:50:45] <Krufu> my personal guess, is that if programmers formed a union, they'd receive better benefits + pay package after a few years.
[03:50:55] <Krufu> I'm also quite convinced is not going to happen any time soon in the US

[10:05:02] <pikapika> What is the point of the partiotning?
[10:05:10] <ChromaCat248> @guest9 are you seperating them based on their order of magnitude
[10:05:14] <pikapika> By what logic is it getting partitioned in that specific manner?
[10:05:24] <Guest9> yes based on number of digits
[10:05:43] <pikapika> Then just sort and do a single run over the resulting list
[10:05:51] <ChromaCat248> oh ok
[10:06:16] <pikapika> list.sort() and then a single for loop over it to generate the partitioning
[10:06:44] <pikapika> And what you need to create a new list that is a sublist of another is slicing
[10:06:45] <pikapika> Look it up
[10:09:08] <ChromaCat248> i can think of an algorithm to do that but based on what guest9 has said i assume he doesn't want help coming up with the algorithm so i won't share it
[10:09:11] <Guest9> radix sort is a different strategy yitz 
[10:09:29] <pikapika> Its an interesting sort if you think about it. If you were doing it in C, you only need to return a 20 element array
[10:09:36] <Guest9> ChromaCat248 please share your help
[10:09:57] <pikapika> (the largest integer in most systems would be 64 bit, which leads to a maximum of 19 digit decimal numbers, so it means you only need to store 20 indices)
[10:10:24] <pikapika> ChromaCat248, as I said, you just need to do a single pass over the array after doing a normal sort

[10:11:17] <pikapika> yitz, yes?
[10:11:32] <pikapika> yitz, when the list is already sorted, you only need to store the indices of each sublist
[10:11:44] <Guest9> ChromaCat248 yes, kind of that, but dont filter your ideas, you may share whatever you find comfortable
[10:11:53] <pikapika> Since obviously all single digit numbers come before 2 digit numbers, which come before 3 digit numbres et
[10:11:59] <yitz> How's that better than having one sorted list and storing just a single ref?
[10:12:01] <pikapika> Which means they are already bracketed in the original array
[10:12:10] <pikapika> yitz, single ref to what?
[10:12:59] <Guest9> imagine i am implementing this without using sort() method yitz in that case, is it helpful?
[10:13:00] <ChromaCat248> my algorithm is you take floor(log10(x)) and use that to determine what list x goes into
[10:13:23] <pikapika> ChromaCat248, I think your idea assumes that he only wants sets of each length number
[10:13:29] <pikapika> If he actually wants the sublists sorted that won't work
[10:13:39] <pikapika> Guest9, which of these do you need?
[10:13:47] <pikapika> Do you need each sublist to also be sorted?
[10:13:55] <pikapika> Oh but of course
[10:14:03] <pikapika> If you want to avoid the complication of the final pass
[10:14:22] <pikapika> You can also just calculate the length of each number as you go through the array and store it in appropriate result list
[10:14:31] <pikapika> And if you still want sorting, you can just sort the sublists in the end
[10:14:34] <pikapika> Good idea ChromaCat248 
[10:14:38] <Guest9> ok let me put steps here: 1) create sublists by number of digits 2) sort each sublist 3)merge sublists
[10:14:47] <pikapika> Guest9, correct
[10:14:58] <pikapika> That seems the simplest indeed

[10:15:55] <yitz> Does it actually buy you much to have half the data in one list and the other half in a bunch of lists?
[10:15:59] <pikapika> No probabilistic analysis is needed, the total memory for the new lists, minus some bookkeeping for each struct, would be the same as the orignals obviously
[10:16:14] <pikapika> However as I said, it might be more memory efficient to just sort the original list inplace and store indices from a single run over it

[10:30:54] <pikapika> Curious
[10:31:23] <yitz> The idea of a unit test is to isolate a small unit of logic. That unit should ideally be possible to isolate from IO. For filesystem stuff, you can use a fake filesystem

[10:33:52] <Arahael> Emilyfire: Testing side effects is annoying and difficult.  What I like to suggest is that you set up the test's needs with files, whatever environment crap it needs, etc, and ensure that it has what it needs to pass the tests.  Use a coverage checker to ensure you cover all the branches in the routine.

[11:20:34] <Arahael> What amazes me is how good apple's cpu's are.
[11:20:54] <AndroidDAW> 16:48 deniska: Arahael: unless a program cooperates to use a mouse, it requires rooting and stuff
[11:20:58] <AndroidDAW> no it doesnt
[11:20:59] <vdamewood> Now if only they'd release new ones.
[11:21:25] <deniska> AndroidDAW: android will show you a mouse cursor and allow to click things, which is fairly useless in a first person shooter
[11:21:36] <AndroidDAW> how so?
[11:21:54] <Arahael> vdamewood: Rumour is they will towards the end of the year.
[11:22:02] <AndroidDAW> sure you cannot multi tap but who really uses multi tap
[11:22:06] <vdamewood> Arahael: Yay!
[11:22:10] <deniska> AndroidDAW: because for the last 30 years mouse in first person shooters is used to look around
[11:22:33] <Arahael> vdamewood: Not sure what that will include, though.

[11:22:44] <deniska> AndroidDAW: just showing cursor on top of a game screen is useless :)
[11:22:47] <AndroidDAW> MOST pc fps games work just fine with mouse anyway so why should android/touch screen availability be any different?

[11:23:17] <AndroidDAW> android also has native support for keyboards too sooo
[11:23:32] <GeDaMo> Wasn't Quake the first to have mouse look?
[11:23:33] <PlanckWalk> Android doesn't pass the mouse motion to the app, does it?
[11:23:35] <deniska> AndroidDAW: because a game specifically should make an API call to hide a mouse cursor and to capture it to get a relative input instead of absolute position input
[11:23:41] <AndroidDAW> PlanckWalk: it does

[11:24:25] <deniska> so for something like a mobile FPS they may choose specifically not to support a mouse
[11:24:28] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: Not really. Until WASD+Mouse was a thing, PFS's had fully customizable controls.
[11:24:29] <PlanckWalk> Ah okay yeah, I see what you mean now.  The program has to be written specifically for a mouse.
[11:24:33] <AndroidDAW> tho by default, android sends a vast array of events relating to mouse and keyboard that View's can respond to if they want to
[11:24:48] <GeDaMo> I only remember playing Wolfenstein and Doom with keyboard only
[11:24:50] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: WASD+Mouse became popular because one competitive quake player used it.
[11:24:52] <AndroidDAW> eg MOUSE_ENTER, MOUSE_HOVER, and so on
[11:24:58] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: Nope. Both worked with mouse.
[11:25:12] <PlanckWalk> If it's only written for the usual touchscreen input, a mouse will be near useless.
[11:25:34] <vdamewood> GeDaMo: Problem is, people would use the mouse for forward/back/turnleft/turnright and not just turnleft/turnright
[11:25:48] <AndroidDAW> "16:54 deniska: so for something like a mobile FPS they may choose specifically not to support a mouse" not entirely
[11:25:58] <vdamewood> And so mouse with Doom and W3D was a pain in the ass.
[11:26:10] <AndroidDAW> a mouse when no view is optimized for it acts exactly like a typical finger
[11:26:25] <AndroidDAW> click anywhere to send a touch down event at that location
[11:26:29] <deniska> AndroidDAW: and that's useless for cheating in fortnite

[11:36:25] <deniska> (or emulator in case of ancient stuff)
[11:37:00] <pikapika> deniska, sometimes older software often used fixed buffer sizes for things that should have had more care in their allocation

[11:39:04] <deniska> not sure, I mostly use win2000 for my old windows stuff :)
[11:39:13] <pikapika> Its not any os or driver feature thats causing the problem
[11:39:25] <pikapika> its assumptions about buffer sizes made by the programmer of the app

[11:40:18] <pikapika> char props[200]=getAudioEnvrionmentPropertiesOrSomething()
[11:40:21] <deniska> ancient OSes won't run on systems with too much RAM, so you just allocate lower amount for a VM
[11:40:25] <pikapika> typical outputs fit nicely into 200 at that time
[11:40:33] <pikapika> On today's systems the output is a 2000 byte string
[11:40:59] <deniska> well, yeah, but we're not running a program on today's system, we run it on the same win98 it was written for

[11:41:10] <pikapika> deniska, same still applies
[11:41:26] <pikapika> Specifically in that case it was about opengl extension list I think
[11:41:46] <pikapika> Things like graphics and audio are too thin to be affected much by a vm
[11:41:57] <deniska> well, then you use PCem or an emulator like that which specifically emulates older video card with an older opengl :)

[13:12:53] <Guest9> while this [[],[]] can hold 2. likewise...
[13:15:40] <pyzozord> yeah, except inserting and appending increases the size of the list so if you have c=[[]] you can only c[0] and then if you c.append([]) then you can do only c[0] or c[1]

[13:36:36] <pyzozord> pikapika: having some bash muscle is useful too. Yesterday I wrote a small command that disassembled and counted and sorted by count instructions in a binary. And I found out that gcc compiled vi for x86 uses about 500 instructions, 100 of which cover about 80% of all instruction count. It clearly has pareto distribution. So it looks like a compiler could be written that knows just 20-100 assembly

[14:08:04] <mrig> this is why sanskrit is still so close to its ancient form.

[14:08:33] <pikapika> Arahael, you read books. But how did you learn to read books.
[14:09:02] <pikapika> mrig, languages like Sanskrit and Latin have had little change because they were used purely for formal purposes like official documentation and high literature
[14:09:03] <Arahael> pikapika: Well, certainly after I became deaf at 1 year old.

[14:12:34] <Arahael> pikapika: I'd say that languages that stay the same for centuries have a *written* component.  Consider one language I use - Auslan - has no written form.  It changes from group to group (somewhat), and from generation to generation.

[17:17:24] <elf_fortrez> how do I get package information for xorg using dnf
[17:17:31] <Arahael> nitrix: If I was setting it up again, I'd probably just use something like debian, and add nix to it.
[17:17:47] <elf_fortrez> xorg-nouveau
[17:18:04] <pikapika> Is it possible to use nix on top of an existing idstro?

[17:18:24] <pikapika> Oh
[17:18:46] <Arahael> pikapika: Yes, everhthing just goes in under /nix

[17:19:04] <Arahael> pikapika: And there's home-manager as well.
[17:19:10] <nitrix> On the bright side, no more ugly MinGW, or WSL docker on Windows. valgrind, -fsanitize, ptrace, lots of good development tools gained.
[17:19:10] <pikapika> So you basically simply not touch the system files and packages at all
[17:19:16] <pikapika> And do everything from the nix folder
[17:19:17] <nitrix> Maybe that's what I should do this weekend.
[17:19:28] <Arahael> pikapika: When nix is used that way, yeah.
[17:19:35] <Arahael> Anyway, I'm off to bed. G'night!

[17:43:16] <ixil> bjs, VM / containers are essentially OS's within OS's so software (on software (...)) on hardware is my point
[17:43:26] <ixil> not that it matters
[17:43:51] <bjs> spynxic: an OS is big and complicated, and continually gets updated to handle more things.  Someone has to actually write the software to make it work.
[17:44:00] <pikapika> ixil, dual booting is always trouble
[17:44:22] <pikapika> spynxic, the installation and updation of software is still an unsolved problem
[17:44:34] <pikapika> There are always complications in that realm
[17:44:56] <bjs> spynxic: if everyone just stopped, and only used the software and hardware they had right now and never did anything different then there'd be no need to maintain software (outside of fixing bugs).
[17:45:10] <ixil> except for hardware bugs
[17:45:11] <bjs> spynxic: pretty much every part of an OS can and does break because of how complicated it all is :)

[17:45:52] <ixil> sorry L4
[17:45:53] <bjs> ixil: even they are complicated and have bugs :)
[17:46:03] <ixil> L4 has no bugs
[17:46:08] <ixil> but yes still complicated
[17:46:41] <ixil> linux is very beginner friendly these days
[17:46:42] <pikapika> ixil, I have heard the supercomputers use very minimized and specialized kernels
[17:46:47] <bjs> well it certainly will have bugs, because getting it right is hard and even just the hardware is complicated
[17:46:50] <spynxic> Thought that the standardization of hardware took away the complications of trying to design a system to work on various hardware profiles so much so that developers needn't concern themselves about "compatibility" between computers 
[17:46:52] <ixil> I think systemd helped things quite a bit
[17:47:03] <pikapika> Like no memory management or virtual memory and single user
[17:47:11] <pikapika> spynxic, no
[17:47:15] <ixil> bjs: L4 is formally proved
[17:47:21] <bjs> ixil: seL4 is,  but not wrt hardware
[17:47:25] <pikapika> Hardware manufacturers don't give any information to Linux kernel people
[17:47:28] <ixil> true
[17:47:31] <pikapika> BSD people have even less weight to throw
[17:47:44] <bjs> ixil: and what seL4 actually proved, is a little unclear (but impressive)
[17:47:54] <pikapika> That so much hardware works on Linux is almost solely to the ingenuity and hard work of reverse engineers
[17:48:05] <ixil> although I think in the next decades formally proved software will start to pick up a bit more steam
[17:48:22] <pikapika> Formally provable software is very obscure
[17:48:29] <pikapika> I don't think most people have the iq to do it
[17:48:55] <elf_fortrez> could you pastebin some
[17:49:10] <pikapika> elf_fortrez, they often prefer languages like haskell
[17:49:17] <pikapika> And like to pretend they are mathematicians
[17:49:53] <elf_fortrez> it needs to run somewhere
[17:50:03] <pikapika> elf_fortrez, they often have a disdain for C people

[17:50:55] <bjs> pikapika: well if you shove the word "fp" at the end then yes they'll like functional languages but I don't know why you snuck the "fp" part in there

[17:51:18] <pikapika> bjs, those are the kinds I usually see talking about "mathematically provable apps"
[17:51:18] <ixil> not functional programming
[17:51:42] <ixil> cofffeee or lunch?
[17:51:49] <bjs> okay well that's just wrong then because the largest formal verification efforts out there are not on functional languages, they're on C and Java and things like that.

[17:55:12] <pikapika> bjs, in mathematics a proof can entail any size of numbers
[17:55:17] <pikapika> Even if you remain strictly finite
[17:55:23] <pikapika> A finite number can be arbitrarily large
[17:55:26] <bjs> pikapika: I think you've never actually done any real verification in a real project before
[17:55:40] <pikapika> 10 is finite, so is pow(pow(10,1000),1000)
[17:55:46] <elf_fortrez> induction
[17:55:56] <pikapika> But RAM is bounded

[17:56:22] <pikapika> bjs, I haven't
[17:56:26] <bjs> because real verification of software is very tedious and deals with the real complexity of software and hardware.  It's mostly the people who write the software that are "floating the clouds" ignoring the complexity (and that's why there are bugs)

[17:56:55] <pikapika> At least C and Java people are vaguely aware of death and pain
[17:56:58] <bjs> pikapika: but the formal people are lower than they are
[17:57:01] <pikapika> Assembly people even more so
[17:57:10] <pikapika> bjs, thats great to hear
[17:57:23] <pikapika> That the formal verification people analyze from a hardware level perspective
[17:57:51] <elf_fortrez> pure math or applied math?
[17:58:07] <pikapika> I would trust applied math people to write okay software yes
[17:58:18] <elf_fortrez> so pure
[17:58:32] <pikapika> Yes I can't trust a pure math person so easily
[17:58:36] <bjs> pikapika: your comments just make it clear you've never done any of this before. Real formal verification digs into the weeds of the languages, the corners that software people don't look at.  That's why software people write buggy code.  It's what makes verifying software so hard,  the deep layers of complexity that you need to punch through to do anything. Whereas the software people can write software without really understanding.
[17:58:52] <pikapika> bjs, yes yes
[17:58:56] <pikapika> That is very good news

[20:00:49] <vdamewood> Sometimes I don't understand human behavior. I just asked a question online (not IRC), and someone posted a response that was oblivious to the question. My question was about whether or not certain special cards for a game I play were available for real, or if players were expected to print off the PDF of them. Someone posted a response of where to find the PDF and that I could print the PDF.
[20:02:28] <novns> vdamewood, and the proper answer is "stop playing these ugly games. life is beautiful!  get a life!"
