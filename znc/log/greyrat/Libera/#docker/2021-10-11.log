[00:05:56] <SJrX> Right now when developing dockerfiles I have to do the following cycle a lot, "docker build", then copy and paste the last image I build, then paste it to docker run. How can I streamline that to get rid of the need of the mouse and copy and paste.

[01:10:18] <gordonjcp> Gamara: everyone starts somewhere
[01:10:29] <gordonjcp> Gamara: my first docker-compose project sucked
[01:10:38] <gordonjcp> a year later, and now look at my docker-compose projects

[01:12:58] <Gamara> yeah probably not lol
[01:13:09] <Gamara> i want to access everything from port 80
[01:13:17] <Gamara> or 443 I guess
[01:13:28] <gordonjcp> Gamara: yeah I was going to say, we all use LetsEncrypt now :-)
[01:13:39] <Gamara> what is LetsEncrypt
[01:13:49] <gordonjcp> it's a certificate authority that hands out free certs
[01:13:54] <Gamara> so should I remove all the ports 8080:8080 etc
[01:13:58] <gordonjcp> yeah for sure
[01:14:10] <Gamara> awesome I will look it up
[01:14:16] <gordonjcp> Gamara: think in terms of what you want to expose to the world
[01:14:20] <gordonjcp> probably just port 80
[01:14:34] <Gamara> should I use expose
[01:14:40] <gordonjcp> no no, just port:
[01:15:00] <gordonjcp> Gamara: do you understand how the networking works there?
[01:15:00] <Gamara> no I mean like to remind me of what ports to use
[01:15:10] <Gamara> yeah docker is connected internally by NAT
[01:15:16] <gordonjcp> yup
[01:15:17] <Gamara> so youcan just use container-name:Port
[01:15:29] <Gamara> I was saying instead of port 8080:8080
[01:15:33] <Gamara> i would do expose: 8080
[01:15:35] <gordonjcp> comment them out then
[01:15:36] <gordonjcp> no
[01:15:38] <Gamara> since expose doesnt do anyhting
[01:15:42] <gordonjcp> you don't need to do that
[01:15:45] <Gamara> ok
[01:15:53] <gordonjcp> so your docker-compose project is on its own subnet
[01:16:07] <gordonjcp> all the containers in a given project can see each other
[01:16:12] <tabakhase> EXPOSE in a dockerfile is free documentation, so have it, but its also used for "docker run -P" whats super rare, and some things abuse it as healthcheck *looking at you gitlab-ci*
[01:16:29] <gordonjcp> tabakhase: oooh, sneaky and scary
[01:16:35] <tabakhase> also used for link, but we dont talk about this anymore ;)
[01:16:47] <Gamara> yeah that is why I was asking
[01:16:51] <Gamara> because I cant remember all these ports
[01:17:05] <gordonjcp> Gamara: so right the way I do it in my "big" project is, I have a webapp that runs on port 5000
[01:17:21] <gordonjcp> Gamara: nginx is a reverse proxy for that, but it is also serving static content
[01:17:43] <ikke> tabakhase: is that related to services on gitlab ci?

[01:18:12] <gordonjcp> Gamara: my config is a little more complex, but think in terms of /static/blah/thing.jpg is served by nginx, /notstatic/stuff/post/1234/ gets served by the webapp
[01:18:17] <tabakhase> ikke what "that"?
[01:18:43] <ikke> the health checks
[01:18:55] <gordonjcp> Gamara: neither the webapp, the database for the webapp, or the redis queue for the webapp expose ports to the outside world, and nginx only exposes port 80
[01:19:09] *** Joins: bashel_ (~bashel@user/bashel)
[01:19:17] <gordonjcp> Gamara: here's the clever bit - you can manually define a network and it'll stay set up no matter what
[01:19:56] *** bashel_ is now known as bashel
[01:20:04] <gordonjcp> Gamara: you then ensure that your docker-compose project knows about its own "default" network and then the manual network, and you define the "networks:" part in the config for nginx, and now nginx has two interfaces each on a different subnet
[01:20:25] <tabakhase> ikke well in itself no (and docker has its very own "HEALTHCHECK") - the deal is that gitlabCI you can define services, back when they wrote this HEALTHCHECK didnt exist (and still today a ton of images dont have one) - so they "just check the first EXPOSE they find in the image" to be reachable, or wait 30 seconds
[01:21:08] <gordonjcp> Gamara: this means you can make two separate docker-compose projects talk to each other, so your web app is in one group of containers, and your proxy that terminates SSL (this can be another nginx reverse proxy) is in a totally separate docker-compose project
[01:21:12] <tabakhase> but hey its only been.... 2... years... https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/3984
[01:21:38] <Gamara> that seems too complicated for me right now haha
[01:21:46] <gordonjcp> Gamara: this might seem like a complicated way to go about it, but what happens next week when you realise that your nginx proxy sucks

[01:23:16] <Gamara> :)
[01:23:45] <Gamara> My question was how do I rebuild containers when I make changes
[01:23:58] <Gamara> so Instead of rebuilding the entire project
[01:24:23] <Gamara> I can just change and update the files in a container
[01:24:37] <gordonjcp> yeah basically
[01:24:59] *** Gustavo6046_ is now known as Gustavo6046
[01:25:12] <Gamara> I mean I can set up a local development environment
[01:25:17] <Gamara> but it seems like a massive chore
[01:25:26] <Gamara> when I already have my docker-compose project setup
[01:26:34] <gordonjcp> is this when you're editing stuff in the app or editing stuff to do with how the container is built?
[01:26:49] <Gamara> when I am editing stuff in the app
[01:26:53] <Gamara> for instance I change a php file
[01:26:58] <Gamara> index.php
[01:27:26] <Gamara> how do I make that change in the containers without rebuilding everything
[01:27:48] <gordonjcp> I don't
[01:28:05] <Gamara> is there no good way or do I have to just run a local environment
[01:28:09] <gordonjcp> when I'm testing stuff I half-containerise it, which is probably evil
[01:28:10] <gordonjcp> well
[01:28:13] <gordonjcp> yes and no
[01:28:31] <gordonjcp> okay I mostly work in Python so the magic tricks are a little different
[01:28:39] <Gamara> fair enough
[01:28:43] <Gamara> I mean its fine if there is no good solution
[01:29:00] <gordonjcp> but mostly what I do is run most of my project in docker but mount my web app source from a directory on the host
[01:29:29] <gordonjcp> with Python you've got the option of using a virtualenv which saves a lot of bother
[01:29:37] <Gamara> yeah virtualenv is nice

[01:29:43] <Gamara> full stack projects are a massive pain lol
[01:30:58] <gordonjcp> alternatively, I'll just run the whole damn lot inside docker as per normal but make the actual "runner" be the flask development auto-reloady thing
[01:31:12] <gordonjcp> can't remember the word, it's 11pm here and I've been up since 6am
[01:31:36] <gordonjcp> but I think you'd get away with mounting your php directory somewhere on the host and editing there, right?

[16:31:56] <kittonian> hi all. i tried asking this over the weekend but no one was around. i am building a brand new server using Docker composer and separate containers for all the software, and need some assistance with iptables to ensure everything will work properly, yet be secure. I have been running a "bare metal" server for almost 20 years and already have an iptables script that works perfectly, however I don't know what I need to modify so th
[16:31:56] <kittonian> at Docker will work correctly.
[16:32:45] <kittonian> I pasted my script for reference at https://hastebin.com/raw/wizenofoma

[16:43:14] <Tach> if I'm right is the bip subnet used for local containers only ?
[16:49:28] <tabakhase> kittonian docker should hack itself in... - the tldr is along the lines of "its a router" and from there all normal networking applies kinda deal
[16:49:50] <tabakhase> (with the point of "-p"/"ports:" creates port-forwarding rule)
[16:50:26] <kittonian> yes I know, but that doesn't help with running an iptables script that flushes all the chains and then sets everything back up every 3 hours because it is updating itself via spamhaus's drop list
[16:50:51] <kittonian> so i need some help modifying my script so that it doesn't break docker every time it updates
[16:52:29] <tabakhase> not sure if you wanne hear "impossible" or "well, rewrite so you dont flush :/"
[16:53:13] <kittonian> obviously it needs to be modified so it doesn't flush everything and kill docker. that's what i'm asking for help with
[16:53:37] <tabakhase> (cause you may have some success with cloning the base setup in there, but youll need to handhold all dynamic things too)
[16:54:50] <tabakhase> where at that point, its more an iptables than a docker question rly... - look how fail2ban & therelike work - chains for targets, hooking on victim - or nftables that offers "sets"
[16:57:24] <kittonian> i appreciate the guidance but i'm well aware of how fail2ban works. i'm not looking for pointers to read docs, i'm looking for someone who has done this before to answer actual questions. i've been doing this for almost 20 years now, but this is the first server i've built using docker, and while i understand what it's doing in theory, i haven't found any documentation on how to accomplish proper protection with updating
[16:57:44] <kittonian> i've been working on this for 4 days now
[16:57:50] <kittonian> so i've google'd, and read tons of docs
[16:58:03] <kittonian> nothing thus far has helped and i'm just about ready to get rid of docker
[16:58:19] <kittonian> so i'm hoping someone can enlighten me on how this is done

[17:22:52] <kittonian> i think i came up with a possible solution for the spamhaus droplist
[17:23:14] <kittonian> if i create a separate chain just for those rules and flush only that chain when it updates, it won't touch the docker stuff
[17:24:26] <kittonian> so now the question is, since i can access various docker containers by name instead of by the internal 172.x ip address docker creates/modifies, would it work to have an iptables rule for incoming/outgoing connections specified by name instead of by the docker internal ip address

[17:36:36] <programmerq> kittonian▸ for any firewall system/script to play nice with docker, it needs to be a lot less greedy. moving your rules to their own chain is a super easy way to do that. As long as the DOCKER* chains are intact and the rules that jump to those chains are also intact, you should be good. a greedy flush of all rules will definitely be disruptive, and docker can really only recover by restarting it
[17:36:38] <programmerq> entirely.
[17:36:56] <programmerq> but it sounds like you're on the right track by moving your script's effort to its own chain.
[17:36:58] <kittonian> right
[17:40:16] <kittonian> so at the end of the drop list script there are a few lines like /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s "$OneNetBlock" -j DROP
[17:40:31] <kittonian> and they are for input, output and forwarding
[17:41:02] <kittonian> does that mean I need to add a spamhaus-input chain and then modify that line to be /sbin/iptables -t spamhaus-input -I INPUT -s "$OneNetBlock" -j DROP
[17:41:32] <kittonian> or can i have them all in a single chain called spamhaus and just do /sbin/iptables -t spamhaus -I INPUT -s "$OneNetBlock" -j DROP
[17:45:26] <kittonian> looks like i need 3 separate chains, one for input, output and forward

[20:20:29] <zen_coder> I want to checkout code via ssh inside a docker image, but I get access problems. Outside of docker it works
[20:20:42] <zen_coder> what is the common approach to use ssh inside docker?
[20:22:28] <zumba_addict> Do we have to pay Docker Hub in order for us to publish docker image?
[20:22:48] <ikke> zumba_addict: not if the image is public
[20:22:56] <zumba_addict> ah cool
[20:23:36] <aminvakil> zumba_addict: i'd suggest using an alternative like quay.io or ghcr.io as docker hub has stupid limits
[20:23:52] <zumba_addict> are those 2 free?
[20:24:02] <aminvakil> yes if it's public :)
[20:24:17] <zumba_addict> cool
[20:24:38] <artok> zen_coder: usually injecting ssh key securely, using swarm mode and secrets, or then you just need to run on secure docker host and have named volume that you mount to container and that volume should have ssh keys
[20:24:41] <zumba_addict> curious though, what limits do Docker Hub imposes?
[20:25:44] <aminvakil> zumba_addict: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits
[20:25:53] <zumba_addict> Thank you 
[20:27:26] <zen_coder> artok: thats quite some work. do you have some working example?

[20:33:49] <artok> people seem to have keys on some directory, "--mount type=bind,source=/some/dir/.ssh,target=/tmp/.ssh,readonly" and then on entrypoint, copy /tmp/.ssh into correct location, do chmodding to make sure keys are with correct permissions (dir 700, public key 644, private key 600)
