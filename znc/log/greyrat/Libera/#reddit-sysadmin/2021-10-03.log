[03:24:02] <Hunterkll> like that's what I do when my ham radio shit bothers other people, like out of pocket filters and shit for their cable lines on my dime
[03:24:04] <Hunterkll> I don't *have* to 
[03:24:14] <Hunterkll> because i'm fully in the legal right
[03:24:20] <Hunterkll> but she may just not know or know how to mitigate
[03:24:28] <Hunterkll> and when i play with a mute it fucks my tone sense all up 
[03:24:35] <nobyk> I put up like cloth bits in the door frame to coushion the sound but idk how I can make my doors make less noise
[03:24:36] <Hunterkll> so i'd reject that solution outright
[03:24:38] <nobyk> I sure don't slam them
[03:24:52] <Hunterkll> nobyk: some neighbors complain just to complain
[03:24:57] <Hunterkll> it sucks but what can you do
[03:25:11] <Hunterkll> tell the landlord your door is too loud, neighbor is complaining
[03:25:13] <haise01_> Houses here doubled in price, if this apartment got sold I could get only 1/3rd of space in house at same price
[03:25:14] <Hunterkll> landlords problem now
[03:25:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:25:17] <haise01_> that is awful
[03:25:35] <nobyk> There's also one tenant in the building that poors frying oil down the drain
[03:25:44] <nobyk> so then the vat that collects all the shit gets fucked

[03:26:20] <nobyk> sceptic tank yes
[03:26:27] <haise01_> oof
[03:26:39] <Hunterkll> you gotta mix some grease busting soap wh ile pouring that shit out at the same time as constantly running hot water
[03:26:42] <Hunterkll> among other things
[03:26:43] <nobyk> that's what the guy said apparantly that has to come fix it. by fix I guess they just empty it
[03:26:55] <Hunterkll> otherwise it clogs shit up
[03:27:00] <nobyk> afaik you gotta recylce that shit
[03:27:11] <Hunterkll> it's not have to - it's a good idea
[03:27:17] <Hunterkll> but it's not required
[03:27:20] <Hunterkll> it's not a hazmat etc etc 
[03:27:42] <nobyk> just.. stop doing it when it has gone wrong several times idk

[03:27:49] <Hunterkll> yea
[03:27:50] <nobyk> people ewwww
[03:27:57] <Hunterkll> like, what i do is just rebottle the oil once its cool 
[03:28:00] <Hunterkll> and toss it in the trash
[03:28:15] <Hunterkll> hot water and grease breakers just move the problem 'further' down line
[03:28:23] <Hunterkll> if you live in a place where 'further' is main sewer pipe
[03:28:26] <Hunterkll> you're golden, not a problem

[03:42:47] <haise01_> lol
[03:42:57] <Hunterkll> problem with flutes is that the sound really comes out of where you're blowing into 
[03:42:59] <Hunterkll> not out the end 
[03:43:15] <Hunterkll> clarinet, it's a mix, both out the bell (which is why bell cracks can be a tonality issue) AND  the holes along the way 
[03:43:39] <haise01_> Its either guitar or flute that she is playing, I don't mind guitar tho, she plays that nicely 
[03:43:53] <Hunterkll> ugh

[04:08:19] <haise01_> Solaris 10 ?
[04:08:34] <jimender2> I never want to go back to those monitors
[04:08:34] <Hunterkll> left: Solaris 8 on a SPARCstation 20 with X-Chat, middle: DEC 3000-300x with VMS 7.3, right: that same P4 running Solaris 10 
[04:08:57] <Hunterkll> i suppose it's better termed my non-windows phase 
[04:09:00] <Sousapro> Hunterkll: I still miss my beige g3 setup from like 99. Maxed out and an orangePC card
[04:09:00] <haise01_> god damn
[04:09:17] <haise01_> Hunterkll: I was born at the wrong time D:
[04:09:19] <Sousapro> I was running windows 98 and Mac OS on it
[04:09:21] <haise01_> all interesting shit was back then
[04:09:28] <Hunterkll> haise01_: oh i got most of that shit for like $5 ea or free
[04:09:39] <Hunterkll> haise01_: oh i'm kicking myself for shit i let go
[04:09:45] <Sousapro> Same here
[04:09:53] <haise01_> I let mine down the drain
[04:09:58] <Hunterkll> haise01_: i gave the 3000-300x (Pelican+) away for FREE one year at a hamfest because of a MCHK error
[04:09:59] <haise01_> AMD APUs are nothing special
[04:10:04] <Hunterkll> i could have just fucking pulled a ramstick to fix it
[04:10:09] <haise01_> lol
[04:10:13] <Hunterkll> and i let SO MUCH NeXT gear go 
[04:10:18] <haise01_> ouch
[04:10:23] <Hunterkll> that people were *putting in dumpsters* in the early 2000s
[04:10:24] <Hunterkll> it's okay
[04:10:26] <Hunterkll> i got my revenge
[04:10:31] <haise01_> how ?
[04:10:34] <Hunterkll> i'm still the largest vendor of NeXT on this side of the mississippi
[04:10:42] <haise01_> lol
[04:10:46] <Hunterkll> I got 17 NeXT laser printers in stock
[04:10:55] <haise01_> jeez
[04:10:58] <Hunterkll> Need a color NeXT monitor? I gotchu 
[04:11:02] <haise01_> how much do you charge for them ?
[04:11:08] <Hunterkll> How much you got?
[04:11:16] <haise01_> $0
[04:11:17] <haise01_> :D
[04:11:26] <haise01_> jk
[04:11:27] <Hunterkll> <customer has been banned from eShop>
[04:11:32] <jimender2> didnt next go out of business
[04:11:35] <haise01_> I would probably shelve around $100-150
[04:11:37] <Hunterkll> jimender2: nope
[04:11:46] <Hunterkll> jimender2: tl;dr NeXT became OS X 
[04:12:25] <Hunterkll> jimender2: basically, after steve jobs got fired from apple, he started NeXT to serve the edu and sci markets, then apple failed at copland (their next gen OS after classic mac os) so wanted next 
[04:12:31] <Hunterkll> so next and apple merged
[04:12:33] <Hunterkll> "merged"
[04:12:40] <Hunterkll> all apple execs were replaced with NeXT execs
[04:12:44] <Hunterkll> with steve jobs as the CEO again 
[04:13:19] <Hunterkll> jimender2: that's why all the core mac OS frameworks and classes start with NS 
[04:13:21] <Hunterkll> NS = nextstep
[04:13:32] <haise01_> good to know
[04:13:34] <Hunterkll> OS X Server 1.0 was NeXTstep with the mac classic UI 
[04:13:40] <Hunterkll> that was the only real major change
[04:13:54] <haise01_> I see some guy from Colorado
[04:14:00] <haise01_> wants $100
[04:14:02] <Hunterkll> haise01_: bob
[04:14:06] <haise01_> for NeXT 400 DPI
[04:14:07] <Hunterkll> bob blessin of black hole?
[04:14:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:14:20] <Hunterkll> I often email him with shit i don't want and make deals
[04:14:27] <Hunterkll> he's the guy on the other side
[04:14:40] <haise01_> lol
[04:14:51] <haise01_> $210 for shipping
[04:14:52] <haise01_> fucking lol
[04:15:04] <Hunterkll> haise01_: you ever hefted a laserjet 3 laserprinter?
[04:15:06] <Hunterkll> i can ship it cheaper
[04:15:07] <Hunterkll> but 
[04:15:14] <Hunterkll> he'll refurb it and validate it, etc 
[04:15:30] <Hunterkll> i'll l ight it up, run a shitty test page or not, and say "might need a new fuser" and send it on 
[04:15:38] <haise01_> I have Laserjet 1320 
[04:15:41] <haise01_> PCL5 iirc
[04:15:45] <haise01_> that still works till this day
[04:15:55] <Hunterkll> my home printer is a laserjet 4+ 
[04:15:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:16:05] <Hunterkll> manufactured in 1993
[04:16:19] <haise01_> your fucking printer is older than me
[04:16:19] <haise01_> lol
[04:16:53] <haise01_> I actually need to dig up my old shit
[04:16:57] <jimender2> I want either a laser or wax printer
[04:17:07] <haise01_> like I remember I have VHS player
[04:17:17] <Sousapro> Hunterkll: Laserjet 4+ is the best printer 
[04:17:17] <haise01_> old Pentium laptops 
[04:17:32] <haise01_> I have Panasonic VHS player
[04:17:33] <haise01_> omfg lol
[04:17:43] <haise01_> I should probably get VHS tape and test it
[04:18:01] <jimender2> I got rid of a laserjet 4+ right before covid
[04:18:13] <Hunterkll> I did a full maint on it too 
[04:18:24] <haise01_> I have HP Laserjet 1320 PCL5 and Epson BX935FWD
[04:18:28] <Hunterkll>   only thing i didn't replace was the blade separator 
[04:18:32] <Hunterkll> cuz well
[04:18:33] <Hunterkll> its uh
[04:18:35] <Hunterkll> it's on my desk
[04:18:36] <Hunterkll> somewhere
[04:18:37] <Hunterkll> -_-
[04:18:47] <Hunterkll> ILL FIND IT AT SOME POINT
[04:18:52] <Hunterkll> <2 years later> ILL FIND IT I SWEAR 
[04:18:57] <haise01_> we believe in you
[04:18:59] <haise01_> you can do it
[04:19:09] <jimender2> you should use it as a heater :)
[04:19:19] <Hunterkll> jimender2: i use it as a breaker blower
[04:19:35] <haise01_> oh my
[04:19:35] <Hunterkll> everyone home? Everyone doing shit? people arguing? TIME TO PRINT
[04:19:38] <jimender2> Nice
[04:19:46] <haise01_> found my dad's IBM Thinkpad from college
[04:19:49] <Hunterkll> 10A inrush current for fuser warmup
[04:19:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:20:02] <Hunterkll> for just .3 seconds
[04:20:11] <Hunterkll> but that's enough to trip that breaker if there's enough people on it
[04:20:43] <haise01_> its an IBM Thinkpad 390X
[04:20:44] <haise01_> lol
[04:20:54] <haise01_> I'll have to find power brick for this thing
[04:21:09] <jimender2> Surprised that you dont have your circuit panel hooked to the internet
[04:21:36] <Hunterkll> jimender2: i have a shotgun in case my printer starts making weird noises
[04:22:07] <haise01_> true IT folk
[04:22:11] <jimender2> printers and paper towel dispensers will be the first machines to take over the world
[04:22:35] <haise01_> found power brick 
[04:23:13] <Hunterkll> Tech enthusiasts: My entire house is smart. 
[04:23:13] <Hunterkll> Tech workers: The only piece of technology in my house is a printer and I keep a gun next to it so I can shoot it if it makes a noise I don't recognize.
[04:23:37] <jimender2> Reminds me that I need to get a gun
[04:23:46] <Hunterkll> jimender2: get 5 extra
[04:23:46] <haise01_> I can't get a gun lol
[04:23:55] <Hunterkll> in case one breaks/malfunctions
[04:24:03] <Hunterkll> printers will KILL YOU 
[04:24:10] <Hunterkll> haise01_: UK?
[04:24:14] <haise01_> EU
[04:24:15] <haise01_> Croatia
[04:24:24] <haise01_> we don't even have proper self defense law
[04:24:31] <Hunterkll> haise01_: ah, UK's one of the worst - Germany i think has the highest rate of ownership of firearms in the EU 
[04:24:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:24:44] <JollyRoger> Hunterkll: oh man, too true, haha.
[04:24:46] <haise01_> we have ugh
[04:24:50] <haise01_> totally legally acquired AKs
[04:24:52] <haise01_> from Yugoslav Wars
[04:25:05] <Hunterkll> haise01_: lol i once took one of my shotguns to the UK legally for a hunting trip
[04:25:10] <Hunterkll> that was a fun paperwork adventure
[04:25:11] <JollyRoger> I've got a blunderbuss...
[04:25:22] <Hunterkll> OMFG I FORGOT ABOUT DAHLIA 
[04:25:24] <Hunterkll> haise01_: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sff4TFNjn_s
[04:25:24] <haise01_> Hunterkll: I despise paperwork 
[04:25:28] <haise01_> when I turned 18
[04:25:31] <haise01_> I had 2-3 hours of paperwork
[04:25:35] <Hunterkll> haise01_: oh i keep my shit strictly on the up and up 
[04:25:57] <Hunterkll> Yes, I have automatic weapons, yes ATF officer, here's the paperwork and tax stamp....
[04:26:03] <haise01_> lol
[04:26:08] <JollyRoger> Hahaha
[04:26:17] <haise01_> you would love our self defense law
[04:26:24] <Hunterkll> my weapon cases have more paperwork than fucking parts
[04:26:27] <jimender2> Im starting to watch Scorpian again.
[04:26:29] <haise01_> for example if you are getting robbed 
[04:26:33] <jimender2> Super funny
[04:26:36] <haise01_> you can shoot burglar only if he shot you first
[04:26:47] <haise01_> if you shoot him first, its criminal offense
[04:26:52] <JollyRoger> Wow, that's shitty.
[04:26:52] <haise01_> it doesn't make fucking sense at all
[04:27:00] <Hunterkll> haise01_: in my state, if they're in my house, i do not have a duty to retreat
[04:27:14] <haise01_> I mean I don't give a shit about law 
[04:27:17] <Hunterkll> haise01_: however, we do have a "reasonable force" requirement 
[04:27:17] <haise01_> if they are in my house
[04:27:18] <jimender2> Here in the US you can shot someone if they come on your land (depends  on the state)
[04:27:23] <haise01_> they will meet my machete most likely
[04:27:27] <Hunterkll> jimender2: my state has reasonable force
[04:27:38] <Hunterkll> so if they come at you with a bat, you'll need a lawyer to justify the shooting
[04:27:47] <jimender2> what state are you again?
[04:27:49] <Hunterkll> if they're unarmed and you had a candlestick in reach 
[04:27:54] <Hunterkll> then you're fucked
[04:28:04] <Hunterkll> jimender2: doesn't matter, there's many states like this
[04:28:09] <haise01_> yeah here you are fucked either way 
[04:28:12] <Hunterkll> now note: i didn't say you're fucked shooting the bat guy 
[04:28:15] <haise01_> you can't defend yourself properly
[04:28:18] <Hunterkll> just gotta justify it properly 
[04:28:18] <haise01_> without being punished 
[04:28:22] <Hunterkll> hence needing a lawyer
[04:28:24] <JollyRoger> Sheesh
[04:28:25] <Hunterkll> but any time you shoot someone
[04:28:29] <Hunterkll> you're getting arrrested
[04:28:30] <Hunterkll> regardless
[04:28:34] <Hunterkll> so you need a lawyer anyway
[04:28:44] <Hunterkll> doesn't matter if it's 100% clear cut
[04:28:47] <Hunterkll> you are going to jail 
[04:28:54] <Hunterkll> now you might be let out in a few hours 
[04:29:01] <Hunterkll> but you're getting charged so the DA can sort it out
[04:29:15] <Hunterkll> standard process
[04:29:39] <Hunterkll> the lawyer just helps you grease it through if you were 100% in the right 
[04:29:46] <jimender2> The law in my state can be summed up as no longer require people to retreat before they can justifiably hurt or kill someone with a gun in self-defense.
[04:29:47] <Hunterkll> and if only 95% in the right, protects you fully 
[04:30:04] <Hunterkll> jimender2: right, castle doctrine
[04:30:18] <haise01_> fuck its 3 AM
[04:30:18] <Hunterkll> our state's castle doctrine requires 'use of force' to be 'reasonable' 
[04:30:20] <haise01_> I gtg
[04:30:22] <haise01_> nice talk guys
[04:30:25] <JollyRoger> Cheers.
[04:30:29] <jimender2> bye haise01

[10:07:25] <JollyRgrs> eww
[10:11:29] <emag> it's definitely new degenerate behavior since the libera split, and i've removed all freenode refs. i feel if i could give a join delay to until after nickserv gets the identify, it *might* be fixed, but if i'm not actively looking, i don't see the split, and a new /join creates a new window, losing all history. annoying AF, but not enough to spend much time on

[13:41:32] <DrZak> cph bike sharing is fun
[13:42:07] <DrZak> first time i ever rented a bike OR ridden a bike without the man geometry = the top tube
[13:42:45] <DrZak> opened the app, took the bike, ridden a while, stopped to take a photo, i was used generally to just stop a keep the bike between my legs
[13:42:52] <DrZak> this bike simply fell to the side
[13:43:05] <DrZak> es there was no top tube to rest against the inside of my leg :))
[13:43:21] <DrZak> also, it has/had about 23-25 kg, so it was surprise

[21:43:05] <technonerd> TIL you can add .patch to github PR
[21:43:06] <radix0> CableNinja. Some personal ones off the top of my head, but I admittedly like very tame thriller/horror: get out, unthinkable, event horizon, lakeview terrace
[21:43:23] <A-KO> damn showers are so good
[21:43:24] <A-KO> ugh
[21:43:26] <CableNinja> "event horizon", "tame"
[21:43:27] <CableNinja> lol
[21:43:35] <radix0> that's an exception in that list lol
[21:43:51] <CableNinja> telgareith unless you can prove that have fun wasting time

[21:45:15] <radix0> CableNinja, what genre would you place it in?
[21:45:38] <Activ8> "someone tell me please what the fuck is wrong with people" - CableNinja - that could have been anxiety.  Some people don't like to be approached and spoken too.
[21:45:42] <CableNinja> and yet you accepted it and opened it up, and used it telgareith.
[21:46:19] <CableNinja> radix0, hm, I guess maybe it'd be in thriller, sort of, but its more 'hardcore mystery' I think
[21:47:00] <CableNinja> Activ8, heh. yeah idk. was some homeless older woman. she wasnt even asking for money, I just felt like being a decent human and that was her response..
[21:47:02] <radix0> Here's what I would do, Telgareith. Shut up on a public forum, sober up, lawyer up, and build a case. If this supplier/seller is indeed sketch, you've now scared them off with your communication and you'll never reclaim your damages. 
[21:48:13] <radix0> The other party is innocent until proven guilty. There is currently a reasonable shadow of a doubt that they're innocent and you broke something. 1 is an accident, 2 is coincidence, 3 is a pattern.
[21:48:14] <Activ8> She obveously liked your dog more than the money.  You realise some homeless people would rather have a dog (I know that wasn't the right thing to answer back with) I tell you know it was anxiety and been lonely that caused that response. 100%!
[21:48:34] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> I dont'; really care anyway
[21:48:49] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> I'll be be dead in 3onths
[21:48:49] <CableNinja> yeh, I get that. I just couldnt believe instead of a thank you, they decided to ask for my dog..
[21:48:52] <CableNinja> fuckin blows me away
[21:49:35] <Activ8> she didn't want your money she wanted your dog despite you giving it to her lol
[21:50:04] <radix0> CableNinja, looking through my collection. Dear Mr Gacy? Sunshine? That's all I got for now.
[21:50:08] <CableNinja> shes lucky she got the money before she asked me that shit, or I'd have taken it back lol
