[00:28:13] <eN_Joy> TimMc: these phrases are the most delicate part of English to a non-native, with that said, once you get the meaning, you understand the way how natives *think*;-) 
[00:29:03] <TimMc> Yeah, it takes a while to tease these phrases apart!
[00:29:27] <TimMc> But this example is also mildly archaic English.
[00:30:16] <TimMc> (That's not to say you shouldn't learn from it, of course—you'll end up with a broader vocabulary.)
[00:30:23] <eN_Joy> That's true, but the idea (of way of thinking) applies still...
[00:31:05] <TimMc> Really, I'm not sure how much native speakers actually think about these phrases, though. :-)
[00:31:55] <TimMc> I think people just learn the phrases from seeing or hearing them as children, guessing at the meaning from context, and using them that way until or unless proven wrong.

[19:29:08] <DynV> if you're called blacky and you're blond, you could be nicknamed too pale.
[19:30:17] <xerxes> DynV: i see.
[19:30:32] <DynV> you know what, if you can come up with a better nickname, let me know, I think a synonym of "too tall" would be best but that's just like my opinion.
[19:31:44] <xerxes> DynV: maybe you can go with something like "Edward Longshanks". but i still think this nickname makes little sense. anybody called "Pale" if his name is "Blacky" doesn't make me think of whether he is blond.
[19:34:02] <DynV> it needs to be translated into elvish, the URL I gave
[19:34:29] <DynV> I think "Edward Longshanks" is very much related to english.
[19:35:39] <xerxes> DynV: just name him "Gimli the Elf". if the dwarf is already famous, "the elf" should serve as a good nickname. that's my suggestion though.
[19:37:23] <xerxes> DynV: it kinda states that it's Gimli, but wait, it's an elf and not a dwarf if you were expecting that.
[19:40:42] <DynV> I mashed "too tall" & "much taller" together and took what was translated, even if the original looks bad.
[19:41:00] <xerxes> DynV: your choice.
[19:41:16] <xerxes> DynV: i still think you should call him "the elf".

[22:06:37] <TimMc> darsie: "Exotic" has a few different meanings. There's a biological sense, of whether the species is native to a place, and a cultural sense of something being "interestingly foreign".
