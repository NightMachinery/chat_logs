[09:20:35] <weltio> would it be enough to symlink the pcakges of cache1 into cache2?
[09:20:42] <weltio> and just Syw?
[09:20:59] <Namarrgon> checking against a cache is a bit weird. what if the installed versions and cached versions differ?
[09:21:25] <Namarrgon> or did you mean "repo" instead of "cache"?
[09:21:25] <weltio> Namarrgon: the installed version is not of my concern
[09:21:59] <weltio> Namarrgon: cache means the pacman cahce, but from it several pacakges are taken into my custom repo
[09:22:11] <weltio> but that does not seem related
[09:22:13] <weltio> :D
[09:22:14] * Namarrgon backs away slowly
[09:22:28] <e36freak> yeah this whole thing seems kinda... fucky and overly complicated

[09:24:24] <weltio> e36freak: the idea is to not waste disk space by downloading packages multiple times
[09:25:13] <weltio> e36freak: "out of date" is checked against cached pacakges or pcaman "installed packages" db?

[09:28:55] <weltio> the cache2 machine only downloads but does not install

[16:08:26] <zenof> how can I stop the blinking wifi led on a thinkpad X60? hoped putting something like 'options iwlwifi led_mode=1' in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf would work, but it doesn't. is that file and/or option to be named after the actual mod's name?
[16:09:02] <jelle> zenof: did you reboot after that?

[21:34:25] <sangy> well nvm, I guess the error is somewhere else (my hda card is not being recognized by pulse)
