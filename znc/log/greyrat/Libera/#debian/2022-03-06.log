[04:11:28] <WormFood> My motherboard does not support overclocking, but I have a K-series (unlocked) CPU. Is there any way to change the multiplier from within Linux, or is that something that can only be changed before boot time (in the "bios")?
[04:13:24] <sussudio> i vaguely recall something involving a governor
[04:13:42] <WormFood> I know, sometimes motherboards that do not support overclocking, can be overclocked. Back in the day, I overclocked my 2.4Ghz Q6600 to 3.0Ghz, simply by covering up one of the "pins" (really a pad) on the cpu.
[04:14:14] <kee> Most CPUs have dynamic clocking these days, but I'm not sure whether that's just within the "normal" range and you need to do fancy magic to change the normal limits.
[04:14:21] <WormFood> yes, that lets you underclock the cpu, and on specific models of cpus, overclock for a burst. But that overclock burst is only on newer CPUs, and mine does not support that.
[04:14:27] *** Quits: casmajavi (~casmajavi@user/casmajavi) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:14:58] <kee> In which case, the answer is probably no.
[04:15:42] <WormFood> on my main machine, I have all kinds of crazy overclocking settings. But on this other machine, I'd like to do something with it, that does not involve jacking up the CPU, and sliding a new motherboard under it.
[04:16:33] <WormFood> I didn't have much hope, but I thought maybe one of these gurus would know of something that I don't.
[04:18:43] <sussudio> isn't a q6600 like a core2quad or something
[04:19:06] <WormFood> yeah. That was back in the day (10+ years ago)
[04:19:36] <sussudio> i'm not sure you can change the frequency on that via software
[04:19:39] <WormFood> That isn't what I have now. Now I'm working with a i7-2700K
[04:20:13] <WormFood> There is no such thing as a "K-Series" with that family of CPU (IIRC)
[04:20:44] <WormFood> That generation did have unlocked CPUs, but I can't remember if they had the K suffix or not.
[04:21:32] <sussudio> i have a K5 somewhere.
[04:21:35] <WormFood> anyways, the Q6600 isn't one of them. But I could trick my Intel (non-overclocking) motherboard, into increasing the bus frequency from 100 to 133, by covering up that pin, and making it think it's a cpu with a 133 mhz external bus
[04:22:03] <WormFood> I have a big stack of old CPUs. Everything except the 1st gen pentiums

[04:23:05] <sussudio> i have one of those. a p60
[04:23:18] <WormFood> yeah, 1st gen was P60 and P66
[04:23:41] <WormFood> 2nd gen was 75/90/100/120/133/140/150/180
[04:24:37] <WormFood> And I remember, overclocking my CPU all the time. I even remember overclocking a 100Mhz or 120Mhz, to 180Mhz, and it was very reliable.
[04:25:03] <sussudio> i overclocked a K5-133 to 166 to be able to play mp3's without them skipping.
[04:25:31] <WormFood> but even at 133, it should play ok
[04:25:39] <WormFood> I mean, if you aren't overloading the cpu
[04:25:54] <WormFood> Was that under Linux, or Winblows?
[04:26:07] <sussudio> win95, i think.

[04:27:54] <WormFood> I had a video capture card, so old, that it was an ISA card (I want to say it was 8-bit, but I'd probably be wrong), and a full length card at that. It has OS/2 drivers for it, so I tried it out under OS/2 (that is what it was bought for), and I could record video, and audio, and it was smooth. And it was compressed too. Not sure if that was done while it was capturing or not.
[04:28:27] <WormFood> Anyways, the exact same hardware, running Win95, would record, but it was very jerky, no sound, and not compressed.
[04:29:39] <sussudio> i think i have something similar that would run on a serial port
[04:29:59] <WormFood> Computers are like air conditioners; they run better when you close windows.
[04:30:15] <sussudio> and one on a parallel port, a snappy, but that would just take screenshots
[04:30:43] <WormFood> now it's easy enough to interface that stuff over usb
[04:31:11] <sussudio> i've had the side off a pc for a few months now. cooling sorts stops working.

[10:15:43] <brachamh> so my otherwise reliable server box has one issue: right around two hours after boot (for example because of a power outage), the ethernet network interface drops connection. it's not down, as running ifup returns an error, and ifdown must be run first. however, the connection is dropped. strangely enough, this does happen almost exactly two hours after boot, consistently. now my question is: what
[10:15:46] <brachamh> would be the best tool to have run on boot (or maybe nearly two hours after) to monitor the network connection so that it can be reset when it drops?
[10:17:20] <sney> there are plenty of scripts in monitoring-plugins that would work for that, plus whatever scheduling you want to use

[10:21:35] <Voldenet> changing the cable is the most sane advice
[10:21:52] <sussudio> if it happens again with the different cable, it wasn't the cable causing the problem.
[10:22:19] <Voldenet> …it could still be broken cable, you can never be sure! :)

[11:13:17] <naicam|ne> for one thing, when i add keys this way they arent being trusted even for the repos they are supposed to be for
[11:13:32] <naicam|ne> so idk what im missing there

[11:35:25] <Khepra> naicam|ne: what was the solution?
[11:36:34] <naicam|ne> well im still trying things, but part of it was a common typo in a couple of my sources
[11:37:07] <naicam|ne> im using the Deb822 file format
[11:37:26] <naicam|ne> and i had Architecture where it should have been Architectures
[11:37:47] <naicam|ne> that fixed three of them
[11:37:56] <naicam|ne> but i still have two that are failing
[11:40:25] <naicam|ne> https://bpa.st/RT6A
[11:42:36] <naicam|ne> but the solution for pulling keys from the server was:
[11:42:36] <naicam|ne> sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/<keyname>-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys <fingerprint>
[11:43:49] <naicam|ne> then you also have to call it from your sources

[14:07:53] <LimeOn> Hello. I want to create a .desktop item that runs a terminal command, but it gets closed after the commands "ends"(and i cannot see the result of the operation). I woul like to know how avoid the closing of the terminal using something like "press ENTER to exit". I tried several ways found in Internet, but those seem not compatible with the terminal i'm using. I'm using Qterminal, and i cannot find the proper way to do that thing. Does somebody knows how the
[14:07:54] <LimeOn> line "Exec=..." should be done to avoid the terminal closing? Thanks.

[14:12:34] <ln> i assume any "press ENTER to exit" behavior in similar situations is achieved by using a helper script that prints that text and waits for input.

[16:06:35] <Khepra> I'd like to know that too. None of the standard queries seem to do
[16:07:00] <mmalter> Hello guys. I am building a new PC and I the video card market has become really complicated. What is the status of free drivers nowadays? I really wish to use the free drivers.
[16:07:01] <Khepra> I mean there's "list" but that doesn't seem to show them all
[16:07:24] <Khepra> mmalter: does free + nonfree firmware bother you?
[16:08:02] <mmalter> Khepra: It's not ideal
[16:08:11] <Khepra> then no gpu for you :)))   jokes aside, the most functional "libre" gpu driver is amdgpu, but it requires non-free firmware.
[16:08:43] <mmalter> oh there is no option :D ok
[16:08:55] <mmalter> well I'll into amdgpu then
[16:08:58] <Khepra> nvidia's nouveau is sadly in terrible state because there's no access to proper firmware. intel is... well works as well as amdgpu I guess, with some exceptions. its performance sux tho
[16:09:14] <Khepra> just be careful you don't buy a fresh new amdGPU.
[16:09:36] <mmalter> I use to have a very old amd and it worked really well but I wish for something a little more beefy
[16:09:39] <amacater_> Most machines require non-free firmware somewhere - maybe wifi, maybe non-free firmware for the processor. Sometimes, annoyingly, even for the sound. If you accept installing firmware-linux-nonfree, you'll be covered.
[16:09:45] <mmalter> Let's say, for the next ten years
[16:09:55] <Khepra> On this gaming/work rig of mine, I have RX 6700 XT. Released March 2021. There's still flakey  support for it now in MArch 2022.
[16:10:11] <shtrb> Khepra, even WITH nonfree firmware we have cavets
[16:10:16] <Khepra> and I mean I'm using latest kernel.org kernels and upstream mesa, libdrm and vulkan
[16:10:26] <Khepra> (so totally frankendebianized setup, still buggy)
[16:10:34] <amacater_> Modern Nvidia cards will work with nouveau to some extent: Nvidia proprietary drivers bring their own problems like tainting the kernel ...
[16:10:55] <mmalter> and yes just one last question
[16:11:04] <mmalter> cuda is nvidia only right?
[16:11:10] <Khepra> my old nvidia, GTX960 stopped working with nouveau since stretch
[16:11:13] <amacater_> I believe so.
[16:11:35] <another|> intels Arc GPUs are supposed to launch this year IIRC
[16:11:36] <Khepra> by "doesn't work" I mean errors + nothing on screen on boot. yes I had firmware. yes I tired nomodeset haxxes
[16:11:46] <mmalter> errr that's annoying. And cuda works on linux?
[16:11:55] <Khepra> another|: that means no support in debian until 2026 :)
[16:12:11] <shtrb> Khepra, will there be support later ?
[16:12:15] <another|> fair point
[16:12:30] <Khepra> shtrb: I don't know, but I don't see why not.
[16:12:36] <Khepra> if intel releases libre code, that is.
[16:12:50] <Khepra> (and they're mostly favouring libre, so.... maybe, probably)
[16:13:20] <shtrb> Someone is too much optimistic
[16:13:26] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@98.97.127.52)
[16:13:43] <mmalter> well I am on integrated graphics intel rn and the drivers are perfect. I feel I am venturing in shitty territory if you excuse the language
[16:14:12] <Khepra> shtrb: well if they want big players to support cloudy gaming, they most certainly will want to make it libre

[16:14:59] <Khepra> GeForce now is very much usable. Google's Stadia.... still alive afaik. New names might join the industry, why, maybe even Intel themselves.
[16:16:45] <Khepra> mmalter: for me, nvidia + proprietary worked with zero issues since 2006. excluding the big known issues like no wayland (until recently) and all the other things revolving around dkms drivers. I switched to amdgpu and I've had nothing but issues.   HOWEVER ....  many others will have the opposite experience. shitty nvidia experience until they switch to something else.
[16:16:53] <shtrb> Until I see AoE2 as a native deb I will not believe it
[16:17:39] <Khepra> shtrb: why would you? Proton works wonders. So well, in fact, that the traditional linux supportes like Feral are no longer planning to port things, but support proton instead.
[16:18:14] <Khepra> the war is lost. windows+linux hybrids are now a norm. despite that bald fatso calling us cancer, people are now embracing MS in their linuxen. the end (of foss) is nigh.

[16:40:11] <mmalter> Vulkan is a big plus, I could use the Haskell bindings.
[16:40:30] <Khepra> mmalter: yes, but debian is not really the most optimal distro for that.
[16:41:10] <mmalter> Oh. You mean I need newer stuff?
[16:41:21] <Khepra> yes.  I'm switching my gaming/work rig to ubuntu, come next LTS next month. I'm really burnt out on having to constantly fight with backporting shit from sid.
[16:41:30] <mmalter> I see
[16:41:51] <Khepra> there's also a reason Valve switched to ArchLinux for their gaming gadget. I can imagine how tiresome bending debian into submission was for them.

[16:47:04] <mmalter> It's funny that choice use to be way easier ten years ago.
[16:47:30] <Khepra> "positive" in that "this shiz works, no glitches, I can play games!".   of course, I couldn't use wayland, there was screen tear with fullscreen video and in games, but meh... I'd rather have those back than have to deal with these glitches and constnatly pumping mesa...

[22:54:46] <Ooze> Hi, good morning. I want to limit the visibility of my data from the Plex instance I'm hosting. I only want the data browse function in Plex to see my media folders. Should I do this by adding the plex user to a group then setting group ownership of my media?

[23:02:40] <randall> vlt: Why are you asking in two channels?
[23:02:42] <randall> !crosspost
[23:02:43] <dpkg> Posting the same question in several places at the same time (IRC channels, news groups, mailing lists, forums) is impolite; your time is NOT more valuable than everyone else's.  Your question might be answered elsewhere, meanwhile we are wasting our time doing research for a problem you've already solved.  Cross-posting can also make you look like a spammer and get you k:lined.  See also <multiple ask> <hurry>.
[23:03:09] <kee> vlt: Download aptitude, open it in xarchiver or something, grab the binary and run that?
[23:03:18] <kee> (aptitude-curses, specifically.)
[23:03:30] <kee> It's really quite a friendly way to fix apt problems.
[23:03:59] <randall> vlt: What did you do to get to that point?
[23:04:22] <randall> vlt: Standard Debian does not have broken dependencies.

[23:50:30] <iobus> hi, is there a script that take packages list (from debian CD repos) and get all their source code packages from debian source repos?
[23:52:13] <sussudio> why would you want to do that
[23:52:32] *** Quits: ty3r0x (~ty3r0x@user/ty3r0x) (Quit: Closed the app, dummy me...)
[23:53:18] <iobus> @sussudio personal archive
[23:54:07] <sussudio> you can just get them at any time in the future.
[23:55:18] <iobus> @sussudio that's the problem, I'm archiving against offline months, just in case ocean fibers go down
[23:55:49] <sney> if you're trying to mirror huge parts of the debian archive, you should follow https://www.debian.org/mirror/ftpmirror#how rather than trying to feed everything through apt

[23:56:37] <TheLinuxNerd> iobus, sussudio, that's the most insane thing I have ever heard
[23:56:49] <TheLinuxNerd> since Linux was sold on disks and floppies
[23:57:09] <kee> If ocean fibers go down, you'll still have your country's local ftp.xx.debian.org mirror.
[23:57:30] <TheLinuxNerd> kee, exactly, and all the ISP ones
[23:57:57] <Sensiva> I have no country local mirror, therefore I have local archive mirrors since the days of etch
[23:58:03] <sussudio> and archive, if you need something from 10 years back, for some reason.
[23:58:11] <iobus> The only easy solution is to download part of a mirror then, thanks @sney
[23:58:31] <kee> TheLinuxNerd: I think it's a perfectly reasonable precaution.
[23:58:34] <kee> Same with cloning Wikipedia.
[23:58:46] <kee> It only seems sensible 10 minutes too late.
[23:58:52] <kee> (As with all disaster planning.)
[23:59:11] <TheLinuxNerd> excuse me, while I go download the whole internet on my phone
[23:59:20] <sussudio> and snapshot, if you need a specific version of a package.
[23:59:39] <kee> TheLinuxNerd: That's reducto ad absurdum. If there's something you know will be useful, why not get it?
[23:59:43] <sussudio> well, there was someone in here recently that wanted to download wikipedia.
[23:59:57] <kee> Isn't there already a project for that?
[23:59:59] <iobus> @sney however, If I could select what packages to mirror, I don't need them all, the debian stick image 16GB is perfect
