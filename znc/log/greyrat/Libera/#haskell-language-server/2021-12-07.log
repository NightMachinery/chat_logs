[14:29:08] <fendor[m]> the pre-commit hook drives me insane
[14:29:54] <fendor[m]> can I execute that without running a nix-shell?
[14:35:01] <fendor[m]> maybe I should just buy-in on nix and launch everything in the nix-shell...
[15:13:16] <jneira[m]> I installed the pre hook commit in windows and works fine
[15:13:40] <jneira[m]> I don't like the little delay but 🤷

[18:25:46] <fendor[m]> I wanted to see where HLS relies on the PATH to find stuff and executed `PATH="~/.ghcup/bin" haskell-language-server <some-file>` to see whether this works
[18:26:16] <fendor[m]> interestingly, hie-bios fails, but once I do `PATH="~/.ghcup/bin:/usr/local/bin" haskell-language-server <some-file>`, it suddenly works
[18:26:40] <fendor[m]> however, `/usr/local/bin` seems to be empty 😲
[18:29:24] <fendor[m]> ah, it makes sense, it is actually not `/usr/local/bin` but rather `/usr/bin` which is required by hie-bios to run the wrapper
[18:31:24] <maerwald> what does it need from /usr/bin?
[18:31:32] <fendor[m]> env
[18:33:26] <arrowd> The text editor I'm using HLS with (KDE Kate) shows escaped HTML entities in popups. That is, `a -&gt; b` instead of `a -> b`.
[18:33:35] <arrowd> Who should I bug with this - HLS or Kate?
[18:33:42] <maerwald> still doesn't work for me, even if i copy env to ~/.ghcup/bin
[18:35:23] <fendor[m]> indeed, it must rely on something else, too...
[18:36:37] <maerwald> PATH="$HOME/.ghcup/bin" cabal --builddir=/home/hasufell/.cache/hie-bios/dist-ghcup-hs-abf009fcc780c393689ddd7007962d8b v2-exec --with-compiler /home/hasufell/.cache/hie-bios/wrapper-13a09b18ea883dd377d59db5e821a86b ghc -v0 -- --numeric-version
[18:36:39] <maerwald> this fails here
[18:36:43] <maerwald> so cabal also does something fishy
[18:36:45] <fendor[m]> oh well, I think it further needs bash, and hls executes gcc at some point
[18:39:02] <fendor[m]> could depend on gcc as well

[19:51:34] <jneira[m]> <arrowd> "The text editor I'm using HLS..." <- afaik vscode, emacs and vim display them correctly (as markdown? not sure)
[19:52:37] <anton-latukha[m]> It is probably a KDE/Kate issue, ask them about it & unicode symbols.
[19:53:21] <anton-latukha[m]> Kate devs probably should be quick to tell & determine the place.
[19:53:58] <anton-latukha[m]> KDE ecosystem is a modular/complex enough anyway, to ask them.
[19:55:46] <anton-latukha[m]> At all I find it a miracle that Kate supports Haskell development. Honestly - I love Kate, & used & earned using it much in my DevOps work.
[19:57:05] <anton-latukha[m]> For know people who use Kate - more power to you. I was one such minimalist & know people that use Kate for Linux Kernel development.

[20:01:20] * arrowd got lost in these sed incantations anyways
[20:01:29] <anton-latukha[m]> KDE has a lot of layers between Kate & HLS. Often it can be between KDE Frameworks, localization, or upstream Qt, or in C++ code.
[20:03:18] <arrowd> I'm 99% sure that there is only a QProcess between Kate and HLS.
[20:04:56] <anton-latukha[m]> <jneira[m]> "afaik vscode, emacs and vim..." <- Afaik - GHC doc part converts docs to markdown for sure. So the Haddock part (if it exists) should do the same.
[20:15:17] <anton-latukha[m]> From what I know/see in the part of docs I know - `ghcide` uses Text & UTF-8 ByteString which it convers into Markdown form.
[20:16:33] <anton-latukha[m]> Because Markdown is a markup that needs to be parsed & represented - it goes throgh parsing & representation inside KDE.
[20:16:38] <anton-latukha[m]> `-&gt` looks like some internal escaping mechanism result.
[20:16:51] <anton-latukha[m]> Because there are no such codes for Unicode characters:
[20:17:00] <anton-latukha[m]> https://unicode-table.com/en/2192/
[20:17:20] <anton-latukha[m]> But `&gt` - is very much a C-world name for `>`.
[20:17:33] <arrowd> &gt; is an HTML escape entity.
[20:18:05] <anton-latukha[m]> Yes, sorry, right.
[20:20:32] <anton-latukha[m]> In any case - if something is wrong with how HLS sends data - it would be useful to get a technical report of that from KDE devs, because we are now try to jump over their head & conjecture why `-&gt` happens particularly in Kate.
[20:21:35] <arrowd> Well, I was just hoping someone here knows how HLS sends its data. I.e. does it perform HTML entity conversion.
[20:22:09] <anton-latukha[m]> My guess it is an internal specifics of KDE parsing/representation processes.
[20:23:01] <anton-latukha[m]> Well, project is big & develops quickly, no one knows it fully. People know a large portions of different parts of it.
[20:24:05] <anton-latukha[m]> Since I do docs work - I would take a look into the code, if HTML conversion happens. But we can just as well just look into LSP specs.
[20:25:10] <anton-latukha[m]> LSP specs & that a lot of IDEs work actually give assurance that data is sent in form proper for LSP API spec.
[20:32:19] <shapr> I'd guess something does conversion, because the doc popups sometimes have things escaped into html but not converted back
[20:33:48] <jneira[m]> <arrowd> "Well, I was just hoping someone..." <- sorry I would need to check the code to be sure, but being other editors seem to render docs correctly I would say this is a Kate particular behaviour
[20:34:16] <anton-latukha[m]> <arrowd> "I'm 99% sure that there is..." <- QProcess launches HLS. But that does not mean that it is all that there is. Docs send by HLS get drawn properly inside the Kate overflow window not magically - data gets requested by Kate from HLS & then gets retrieved & goes through multiple layers in the Kate, if xml/html is send - it gets parsed/represented through KDE Framewors & Qt & after parsing the styles get applied
[20:34:16] <anton-latukha[m]> to it & fitting into the window happens.
[20:35:13] <jneira[m]> not saying that Kate is incorrect nor we could do something to fix it for all efitors
[20:35:57] <anton-latukha[m]> `afaik` HLS most probably currently sends `->` in ASCII `- >` & so we get `-&gt` in XML/HTML form.
[20:36:03] <jneira[m]> arrowd: how is Kate rendering other Lang server docs?
[20:36:17] <jneira[m]> s/efitors/editors/
[20:36:38] <jneira[m]> anton-latukha[m]: I think so
[20:36:54] <arrowd> Dunno, I also didn't look into that yet. I was actually thinking there is some option on the server side that enables/disables the conversion.
[20:37:04] <anton-latukha[m]> BTW, do you use Haskell Unicode characters extension? Do we talk about `->` or `- >`.
[20:37:23] <arrowd> No special setup on the GHC side.
[20:37:28] <anton-latukha[m]> s/`->`/->/, s/`- >`./`->`./
[20:38:36] <anton-latukha[m]> In any case - it is easier for both parties to communicate with KDE, if there errors - they would formulate the reports to solve all needed things at once.
