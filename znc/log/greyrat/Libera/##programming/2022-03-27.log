[01:12:41] <pyzozord> look at this staggering contrast. 90% of the time I use curl just to download something of a http server. I use software that is the size of 30 big books. I wrote crude but working version of what I need in 3... lines!

[01:13:24] <flaqoniun> curl ships with a bunch of certificates
[01:13:56] <pyzozord> I took measerment from the internet that curl has 150k loc, I assume this doesn't include stuff like certificates
[01:13:56] <flaqoniun> and presumably verifies chain of trust

[02:03:17] <pyzozord> hmm yeah might be
[02:03:29] <ProfSimm> We desperately need to realize we need to not only add features to standards, products and protocols, but also clean-up mistakes and unused parts.
[02:03:31] <flaqoniun> i don't know, i think curl has flourished into the standard http/s swiss army knife because of all the complexity involved

[02:04:32] <oldlaptop> Out of the whole list that curl supports, HTTP/S covers a *huge* majority of its usecases. Most of the rest are either mostly of historical interest, or are not usually best used with a tool like curl in the first place.

[04:15:03] <pulse> programming videogames is a great way to learn
[04:15:05] <biberao> but
[04:15:31] <biberao> i feel i have a lot of deficits in a lot of places
[04:15:55] <jack_rabbit> biberao, that's why your programs will probably be bad at first. But you'll learn from them and your next ones will be better.
[04:16:07] <f843d0> biberao: that's named a early-stage life :D
[04:16:18] <bin-bash> biberao, what does your user name mean
[04:16:21] <biberao> i was using this Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Practical Programming for Total Beginners by Al Sweigart

[06:28:28] <jack_rabbit> So it's basically an array but some values have labels that can be used to access particular values
[06:28:33] <jack_rabbit> Is that right?
[06:28:42] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: and some labels have implicit values 
[06:28:44] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[06:29:09] <jack_rabbit> ProfSimm, How do you know what the implicit value is? Is the array typed? Like all values are integers or somesuch?
[06:29:13] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: in essense it's a keyval sequence, where vals may have no keys and keys may have no vals
[06:29:45] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: depends on the primitive. 
[06:30:02] <jack_rabbit> Ok. That makes sense in that case.
[06:30:17] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: for example for objects it's like in JS {foo, bar} is expanded to {foo: foo, bar: bar}

[06:30:41] <ProfSimm> kee: typing ":" in front of every value would be bad for arrays
[06:30:59] <jack_rabbit> What about {1; 2;}?
[06:31:09] <ProfSimm> kee: I was thinking earlier maybe instead ":foo" means key where the value is the same as the key
[06:31:19] <kee> That would work too.
[06:31:25] <kee> I don't like the semicolon.
[06:31:27] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: that'd be two keys 1 and 2 with no values
[06:31:42] <jack_rabbit> They don't have an implicit value?
[06:31:46] <jack_rabbit> Then how can they be keys?
[06:31:50] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: yes implicit value
[06:32:04] <jack_rabbit> Right, what's the implicit value for a key with no value?
[06:32:55] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: I defer these choices to the constructor, so when you type, for example:  map {....} the map decides if it accepts just values, or implicit values, duplicate keys and so on
[06:33:20] <jack_rabbit> Ok, so you have a concept of constructors that construct these and makes those decisions, is that right?
[06:33:57] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: yes, I'm trying to figure out a general way to describe arrays, maps, sets, and so on that can flexibly adapt to different constructors' needs
[06:34:11] <kee> ProfSimm: That's a syntax thing.
[06:34:19] <jack_rabbit> Ok. makes sense then. I agree with kee though, the semicolon looks out of place.
[06:34:26] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: you can see a parser for this thing here: https://www.coltram.com/proto/
[06:34:27] <bayaz> Title: Parser 
[06:34:39] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: this version uses the semicolons.
[06:34:48] <kee> ProfSimm: Do what Python does?
[06:34:58] <jack_rabbit> I would prefer {1, 2, 3:, 4, 5: 6}, where 3 is a key with no value, 1, 2, 4 are values with no key, and 5 is a key with value 6.
[06:35:00] <kee> Have the key-less values, then a separator, then the valueless keys.
[06:35:20] <kee> jack_rabbit: That syntax looks better than my suggestion.
[06:35:24] <ProfSimm> kee: hmm what more specifically
[06:35:36] <kee> {1, 2: 3 ; 4, 5}
[06:35:38] <kee> Or maybe
[06:35:51] <kee> {1; 2: 3, 4, 5}
[06:35:53] <jack_rabbit> I don't think a second separator token is required.
[06:35:59] <jack_rabbit> colon and comma should be enough.
[06:36:03] <kee> jack_rabbit: Not with your approach, no.
[06:36:08] <jack_rabbit> no?
[06:36:09] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit:  this is how I came up with the semicolon tbh. Because it looks like colon and comma
[06:36:17] <kee> jack_rabbit: No is agreement. :-)
[06:36:27] <jack_rabbit> ahh.
[06:36:31] <kee> ProfSimm: It doesn't look like a colon, because I'm used to English.

[06:38:58] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: another issue I had is I wanted the comma to be implicit before a label, because this same construct is used to write classes, in the form:
[06:39:32] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit:     classname: {constructor foo: method  bar: method  baz: method ...}
[06:39:43] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: when you spread it on multiple lines the comma is annoying
[06:40:03] <jack_rabbit> I think you can make the comma implicit, but only after a newline. I generally don't like syntactic whitespace (see: python), but in this case it seems OK.
[06:40:39] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: I tried that too (newline = comma) but the problem is it makes other expressions where you wanna break a line ambiguous
[06:41:08] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: I'll play with significant whitespace once the expression tree and so on is fixed, so i can generate various syntaxes out of it
[06:41:09] <jack_rabbit> newline = comma *ONLY* when expecting a comma
[06:41:32] <jiffe> anyone know a good way to grab transaction information from my financial institutions (wells fargo, discover, paypal (amazon ?))
[06:41:34] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: I get it. But it's a bit subtle
[06:41:43] <kee> jiffe: A GDPR request.
[06:41:53] <kee> Specifically, a GDPR interoperability request
[06:41:57] <jack_rabbit> ProfSimm, yeah, Not sure it's a good idea. It definitely looks nicer, but maybe more complicated than it's worth.
[06:42:09] <kee> I think PayPal has an API, though.
[06:42:11] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: you know in JS a newline is a semicolon only when expecting a semiclon and it causes issues. Like "return \n  5 + 5;" (returns undefined)
[06:42:21] <jack_rabbit> right.
[06:42:27] <kee> So, JS inserts a semicolon only when it causes subtle bugs.
[06:42:30] <kee> Gotcha.
[06:42:34] <jiffe> kee: yeah I'm looking for apis that I can automatically pull information from really
[06:42:35] <ProfSimm> kee: exactly
[06:42:40] <jack_rabbit> Rules like that introduce subtleties that aren't necessarily desirable.
[06:42:46] <jack_rabbit> So maybe best to leave it out.
[06:42:56] <jack_rabbit> A comma after a class name isn't the worst thing in the world.
[06:43:01] <ProfSimm> I may leave it out and come back to it later
[06:43:03] <kee> jiffe: A GDPR interoperability request means they have to make one. :-)

[06:56:35] <jack_rabbit> I've gotten stuck on that before. Now I generally just go with the simplest thing that can clearly represent my structure.

[06:57:02] <jack_rabbit> Preemtive sugar is like preemtive optimization: waste of time.
[06:58:22] <jack_rabbit> We can take the example of lisp. S-expressions were originally intended to be an intermediate representation, but they were simple and clear enough that people liked and used them.
[06:58:26] <jack_rabbit> And now we have lisp
[06:59:20] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: on the flip side one could say the lack of infix operators etc. is one reason people can't take Lisp seriously
[06:59:44] <jack_rabbit> True.
[06:59:54] <jack_rabbit> Although various lisps solved those issues.
[07:00:05] <jack_rabbit> And people didn't really use those improvements.
[07:00:06] <ProfSimm> jack_rabbit: I added infix so it "looks" like normal code, but internally it parses all to lists of commands. Like s-expr except it's not limited to 2 items, it's N items.

[08:58:54] <ent58> I found the C standard discussion over making `void *p = (void *)some_function;` produce a diagnostic with -Wpedantic interesting
[08:59:53] <ent58> even when the C11 standard had..I think a non normative take on it where they basically said that it should be okay to do

[10:13:38] <vdamewood> I've never heard the 'in source form' part.
[10:13:56] <vdamewood> After all, the ls on my computer is still a program, even though I only have the binary.
[10:14:01] <sonny> the process is what happens when it is being executed

[10:17:19] <vdamewood> Then what do you mean by 'predefined'?
[10:18:53] <Bin_Bash> For example, pushing left on a joystick for a RC is a command not a program since its not predefined. But if I predefine it like so: Left, right, right, left. Then it fits the definition of a program

[11:06:49] <sonny> yeah modes suck
[11:07:43] <loganlee[gnu]> hi guys
[11:07:48] <vdamewood> I prefer GUI editors that make heavy use of the Control and Command keys.
[11:08:20] <vdamewood> (Or Control and Alt on not-macOS)
[11:10:23] <bin-bash> I switched to vim because of ctrl and alt shortcuts. They started to give me really bad wrist pain.
[11:11:00] <vdamewood> bin-bash: You're supposed to use one hand for ctrl/alt and the other hand for the key you're pressing.
[11:12:51] <bin-bash> That takes too much effort when you do it repeatedly 
[11:13:22] <sonny> bind them to another combination
[11:13:34] <sonny> well, I guess only emacs can do that
[11:14:18] <bin-bash> Bind them to another combination + create modes = vim

[12:07:43] <Tech_8> vdamewood: what you doing this fine hour?
[12:07:55] <vdamewood> Drinking tea and watching videos on Qt.
[12:08:35] <Tech_8> whats qt
[12:08:58] <vdamewood> It's a library for making cross-platform applications.
[12:09:08] <Tech_8> and what kind of tea
[12:09:18] <vdamewood> Japanese green tea.
[12:09:32] <Tech_8> cold or hot
[12:09:42] <vdamewood> hot, hence the burned tongue.
[12:09:47] <Tech_8> oh
[12:09:53] <Tech_8> cool
[12:10:02] <vdamewood> sNo hot.
[12:10:07] <vdamewood> No, hot!
[12:10:11] <Tech_8> so qt is a cross platform library
[12:10:29] <vdamewood> Well, it's actually multiple libraries these days, but yep.
[12:10:36] <jiffe> anyone used the paypal apis with a personal (non-business) account ?
[12:10:37] <Tech_8> so like if you wanted to make program for windows linux and mac you would use  it
[12:10:48] <vdamewood> Yep.
[12:10:55] <vdamewood> Or iOS or Android even.
[12:11:18] <Tech_8> so those librarys come with each OS?
[12:11:28] <vdamewood> Nope. It's third-party.
[12:11:28] <Tech_8> or you got to get them like you do with java
[12:11:43] <Tech_8> so you have to install the librarys
[12:11:48] <Tech_8> it wont auto work
[12:11:50] <vdamewood> Usually the developer includes the Qt libraries with their app.
[12:12:07] <Tech_8> why not use java
[12:12:07] <vdamewood> Though, most Linux distros have Qt available in their package manager. KDE is based on Qt.
[12:12:44] <Tech_8> so what app do you plan on making
[12:13:16] <vdamewood> Because Java's GUI APIs are terribleNothing at the moment, I'm just watching the videos to see if I'd recommend them to someone.
[12:13:34] <vdamewood> oops s/terribleNothing/terrible. Nothing/
[12:14:00] <vdamewood> Also, Qt is written in C++ and exposes a C++ API, so you can use C++ to make apps with Qt.
[12:14:13] <vdamewood> There's also a Python API available called PySide.
[12:15:55] <vdamewood> Also, what I've seen of Java's GUI apis don't take into account the HIG on the local system. For example, Menubars in macOS are at the top of the screen, not the top of the Windows, but every Java app I've used has put the menubar at the top of the window.
[12:16:33] <Tech_8> good point
[12:16:44] <Tech_8> maybe they have mac library for that
[12:16:56] <Tech_8> or apis
[12:17:30] <vdamewood> Well, if you use Qt's APIs it just automatically does the right one.
[12:19:07] <vdamewood> I think I want to figure out how to use Qt's Internationalization API.

[12:26:14] <vdamewood> Oh, yes.

[18:36:43] <vdamewood> And Qt linguist is broken.

[18:37:58] <vdamewood> amigojapan: It tries to color-code the different languages, but the color-coding assumes light mode, so now I have white text on a pastel background
[18:38:04] <bomb> vdamewood I appreciate you for keeping the ancient Qt culture alive :)
[18:38:17] <ross> amigojapan: what I'm planning to do is have a thing on my website that queries the data and says "yes, this service is still running" if the timestamp is within a certain threshold, or "no this service is no longer running" if it's not
[18:38:32] <ross> otherwise prospective users may find it hard to tell whether it's abandoned or not
[18:38:35] <amigojapan> ouch vdamewood
[18:38:46] <ross> if I can say "yep, it last ran 20 mins ago" that'll be reassuring
[18:39:30] <amigojapan> ross: there is a library for rest that allows you to update information withought needing to poll it all the time

[21:31:45] <apotheon> In theory, any Turing complete programming language can be used as a preprocessor for other languages.
[21:31:53] <Rounin> Hm well... If your program is doing something super-repetitive, right... But the number of repetitions and variations is fixed...
[21:31:55] <apotheon> . . . but I'm not going to use Brainfuck for that, either.
[21:32:00] <pulse> apotheon, sure, but PHP is uniquely suited as it's pretty painless to set up
[21:32:01] <Rounin> Of course, a good compiler might know how to inline that for you
[21:32:12] <pulse> there's no rule that says PHP should output HTML
[21:32:16] <Rounin> But you could also have had a preprocessor spit out compile-time loops for you somehow
[21:32:21] <pulse> you can output a C program just as well
[21:32:22] <apotheon> How is it unique in that regard?
[21:32:40] <Rounin> I'm not sure I'd use PHP for that, though... I'd just do the whole thing in D or something like that

[21:33:45] <apotheon> there, now Ruby is a match for PHP, but less awful by orders of magnitude
[21:34:01] <pulse> i've never used ruby *shrug*
[21:34:16] <apotheon> Python offers similar capabilities.
[21:34:46] <Rounin> Ruby is a bit more... "Yeah, Python is great, but what if we added bells and whistles... and then we gave the bells and whistles bells and whistles?"

[21:35:04] <oldlaptop> Some of them do manage not to be composed primarily of warts
[21:35:05] <Rounin> I personally love it, but it's definitely different from Python in that regard
[21:35:06] <amazigh> but php first, javascript second stand out
[21:35:10] <pulse> PHP has a unique advantage that you can treat the file as plaintext and simply insert <?php ?> anywhere you need processing
[21:35:34] <oldlaptop> which is a way of saying the php interpreter happens to be written as a template engine
[21:35:43] <apotheon> Ruby is, to a significant degree, a language-creation language (most well-suited for DSLs), so I think you'd be better off with Ruby than most other Turing complete languages if you wanted to use one as a preprocessor for another language.

[21:37:56] <apotheon> amazigh: It's a concurrency thing, sorta like threads, sorta

[22:03:42] <pulse> although i'd probably prefer to use JS on the backend these days
[22:03:47] <bomb> friendly fire alarm lol
[22:04:03] <pulse> PHP has a certain charm too. it's just buried under a pile of extremely bad coding practices
[22:04:14] <apotheon> pulse: I get huge ecosystems all over the place.  One benefit of PHP is that it's available everywhere, but if it vanished tomorrow something else would be available everywhere instead.
[22:04:18] <bomb> you can code extremely bad in C++ too
[22:04:19] <pulse> (like combining and intertwining 5 different languages into a single file)
[22:04:34] <pulse> apotheon, the web would collapse without php :p
[22:04:36] <waylore> C++ itself is extremely bad
[22:04:46] <oldlaptop> I think you'll find a lot of the same people that dislike php dislike C++ too.

[22:07:37] <bomb> bye
[22:07:41] * pulse finds C++ fantastic, and PHP only borderline useful
[22:08:07] <pulse> i would use C more but every time i try ... i start missing C++'s STL very quickly
[22:08:08] <pyzozord> for me it's the opposite, I find php fine, and c++ unacceptable
[22:08:26] <bomb> why would you even use C
[22:08:34] <apotheon> It's my favorite video game.
[22:08:35] <apotheon> That's why.
[22:08:37] <pulse> because C is a beautiful language
[22:08:45] <apotheon> That's another way to put it.
[22:08:49] <pulse> C = simplicity + raw power
[22:08:54] <EdFletcher> bomb: low-resource devices 
[22:08:55] <oldlaptop> pulse: A data structures library is outside C's scope, and inside C++'s scope.
[22:09:10] <bomb> EdFletcher there is C++ for that
[22:09:23] <pulse> oldlaptop, it's less practical in the real world, at least for what i want to do most of the time
[22:09:27] <EdFletcher> bomb: C++ can be too heavy for tiny devices, unless you pull out a lot of the good stuff 
[22:09:32] <pulse> i will force myself to write a C game eventually though
[22:09:33] <apotheon> To really target low resource devices in C++, you mostly need to write C.
[22:09:42] <EdFletcher> haha yeah exactly 
[22:09:44] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: I think there are few nice libraries with data structures in linux gnu bsds that are often used
[22:09:46] <bomb> no
[22:09:47] <EdFletcher> you pair it down enough it's basically C 
[22:09:49] <oldlaptop> Well, you write your own data structures, or use one of the various divers data structure libraries for C that already exist.
[22:09:56] <bomb> why are you so detached from the reality?
[22:10:01] <EdFletcher> toss out RTTI, toss out exception handling, toss out dynamic allocation... 
[22:10:15] <apotheon> EdFletcher: s/pair/pare/
[22:10:23] <pulse> oldlaptop, yeah. you get it for free in C++, though
[22:10:24] <EdFletcher> apotheon: damn good catch! i always do that 
[22:10:26] <ProfSimm> Gravity has announced it has stopped operating in Russia and left the country. Floating people observed everywhere.
[22:10:36] <oldlaptop> (Some of that stuff is indeed in POSIX, or the historical BSD/GNU C libraries.)
[22:10:40] <oldlaptop> ProfSimm: Please, don't.
[22:10:40] <pulse> largely the appeal of C++ for me is just all the quality-of-life features it provides
[22:10:46] <pulse> plus of course OOP
[22:10:47] <apotheon> pulse: "for free"
[22:10:53] <oldlaptop> Do that somewhere else. Anywhere else.
[22:10:55] <ProfSimm> oldlaptop: sigh, ok dad :P
[22:11:11] <pulse> apotheon, the language itself and the toolkits are hugely more complex, sure. but the executable isn't
[22:11:18] <oldlaptop> pulse: You get this one data structures library "for free". If you like another one better, too bad.
[22:11:33] <bomb> C is a security threat
[22:11:33] <apotheon> ProfSimm: I'm amused, but please stop.
[22:11:36] <oldlaptop> (Such is the nature of tradeoffs)
[22:11:51] <pyzozord> hmm I have a problem with my makeshift cli browser. I didn't thought it would be a problem but manual redirects are PITA
[22:11:54] <pulse> i would interpose with a relatively objective opinion that C++ STL is (mostly) optimal
[22:12:06] <pyzozord> I'm wondering how can I make my shell script go recursive to follow the redirects
[22:12:21] <bomb> there isn't a single platform that C can compile to, that C++ can't

[22:44:31] <flaqoniun> there have been exploits in the font rendering librari(es), font files are URI's
[22:44:39] <flaqoniun> i think libgraphite i s one example

[22:44:58] <bjs> teut: but there's always bugs in specific devices, operating systems, phone software etc so maybe there does exist something but you'd have to find it.  And obviously people who make phones try to protect the phones, they try to fix bugs and they try to make it so you can't.

[22:46:08] <bomb> not impossible
[22:46:09] <pyzozord> sonny: the answer is intellectually stimulating puzzle. A system of objects and rules and the conceiving of a way to "solve" it

[22:46:15] <teut> ok , so everything goes through google store
[22:46:26] <pulse> if you could go back in time with some knowledge from today, you could probably hack any machine lol
[22:46:30] <bomb> not necessarily. Jesus
[22:46:32] <sonny> i'm thinking os ios, dunnu android

[22:46:40] <pyzozord> sonny: that's exactly what chess are, except with really complex tree of possibilities

[22:56:06] <pulse> waylore, in my opinion is the best desktop OS of them all
[22:56:19] <waylore> pulse: and thats ok. we all have our preferences!
[22:56:21] <pulse> it certainly has by far the biggest software library at its disposal
[22:56:22] <teut> I needed to clear the  data structures and algorithms round in interviews

[22:56:57] <bomb> yeah, data structures and algorithms have nothing to do with gamedev
[22:56:58] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: in a recent version they started requiring spaces around some infix operators, and there are bunch of ad-hoc solutions they have for other situations, that they're now trying to clean up. This kinda mess is something I wish to avoid from the start by having a single solution for all operators
[22:57:02] <pulse> i use both on the regular
[22:57:06] <bjs> teut: personally I usually define "hack" to mean getting a system to do something it wasn't supposed to do,  as this often requires technical knowledge to achieve over more generic "attacks".  But there's no hard definition
[22:57:13] <sonny> pulse what do you mean by library?
[22:57:21] <waylore> in my point of view, windows is a manipulating piece of software that purposefully limits all of our freedom when it comes to anything really, not just computing

[22:58:50] <sonny> photoshop => gimp, autocad => freecad, logic => ???
[22:58:53] <bjs> teut: spyware is one very specific kind of software, and surely "hacking" encompasses a lot more than just that.
[22:59:05] <teut> ya, sure , ransomware etc
[22:59:07] <bjs> teut: the world of "attacking computer systems" is very large and hard to defend yourself from.
[22:59:16] <waylore> BTW most malware runs on Windows, does that make it the worst OS with your logic??

[23:17:35] <bnchs> and started integrating their own products like shit
[23:17:36] <kee> I didn't think they personalised the ads…
[23:17:37] <waylore> Windows 11 requires a microsoft account in order to use it :))
[23:17:39] <pulse> the only "ad" i've seen is the candy crush thing you get in your start menu on install
[23:17:42] <kee> I guess I was naïve.
[23:17:44] <pulse> but you right click on it and click remove
[23:17:45] <bnchs> kee: don't get me started on the ADS ON THE START MENU
[23:17:48] <pulse> and then you never see it again
[23:17:54] <sonny> kee you can opt out

[23:18:09] <bnchs> waylore: they even require internet connection

[23:18:14] <sonny> you opt out of personalization
[23:18:18] <kee> Did that too.
[23:18:22] <sonny> so they are just 'random' ads
[23:18:26] <pulse> trust me i hate ads. if i saw one i'd be hacking the registry the next minute to get rid of it :p

[23:22:24] <pyzozord> I should have thought about that long time ago
[23:22:40] <sonny> the downside of using a microsoft account is, when you switch from a local account, your user id is some bizzare string

[23:46:42] <pyzozord> pulse: unreliable clients
[23:47:03] <pulse> you have to cope with loneliness/lack of social environment, forcing yourself to be disciplined, going above and beyond to learn stuff you simply don't have to learn in most job environments (such as business and all the bureaucracy that goes with it)
[23:47:11] <sonny> m$ pluton is such a good idea

[23:47:50] <pyzozord> pulse: I work remotely, and I think I am disciplined enough about my day job
[23:47:53] <pulse> pyzozord, it's not all roses and unicorns in the freelance world. but it does give you ultimate freedom to do whatever you want to do. for example for one of my clients i simply wrote the entire stack in javascript
[23:48:02] <pyzozord> learning business stuff would be pain but hopefull managable
[23:48:17] <pulse> instead of going with some godawful JS framework, i simply coded a ~20kloc JS stack that handles everything from UI to specific vendor needs
[23:48:20] <sonny> protect yourself by having all network devices have a unique id and store keys in a secure enclave
[23:48:23] <pulse> and i enjoyed doing that work
[23:48:42] <pyzozord> 20kloc is a lot, that was a big project
[23:48:44] <pulse> pyzozord, what i'm trying to convey hopefully is that it's not for everyone
[23:48:46] <ProfSimm> Do you sometimes wish you had a TODO application written for programmers
[23:48:54] <ProfSimm> Where you can write your life as a program... and run it
[23:48:57] <pulse> pyzozord, that was just my custom framework. then i build apps on top of that
[23:49:14] <sonny> ProfSimm I used to, but TODO workflow is too specifc to indiviual
[23:49:21] <sonny> anything you make will be inflexible

[23:49:54] <ProfSimm> sonny: what is inflexible

[23:53:00] <pulse> pyzozord, yes, but not when starting out
[23:53:10] <ProfSimm> sonny: there is a system that works, the problem is finding it
[23:53:33] <sonny> my point is everyone has a different system
[23:53:51] <flaqoniun> different?
[23:53:56] <ProfSimm> sonny: sure but this is where programmability comes in
[23:53:57] <flaqoniun> it's all x86
[23:54:00] <pyzozord> pulse: ok, thanks for sharing all
[23:54:18] <sonny> ProfSimm putting an interpreter in something is a bad idea
[23:54:25] <ProfSimm> sonny: why
[23:54:29] <flaqoniun> i feel like youtube turns my computer into a botnet
[23:54:32] <sonny> and making a language to describe workflows would require a lot of research
[23:54:42] <sonny> ProfSimm see the browser, emacs

[23:56:31] <vdamewood> Yay! My app runs in Esperanto!
[23:57:07] <pulse> pyzozord, it's good but it has downsides. my plan is to work for a few more years then retire early and focus 100% on developing my own games
[23:57:19] <ProfSimm> sonny: other bad examples of scriptable applications: Excel, Photoshop, virtually all 3D animation software, compositing and visual effects software, music composition software.
[23:57:21] <sonny> vdamewood do you have an english compiler too?
[23:57:23] <pulse> currently i'm a bit stretching for time

[23:57:44] <sonny> Excel is good, you want it there
[23:57:46] <vdamewood> sonny: Compiler?
[23:57:54] <sonny> it is software like matlab, R etc
[23:57:58] <pyzozord> pulse: yeah that's the dream with in the dream
[23:58:16] <pulse> pyzozord, basically if you're good, you can do it. there's so many bad developers in the world, you only need to be a little bit better and then all that's left to do is to believe in yourself
[23:58:23] <pulse> most people don't believe in themselves
[23:58:27] <ProfSimm> vdamewood: we can make this punishment for war crimes. You're sentenced to go live on an island, where the only legal language is Esperanto
[23:58:33] <pulse> and that's the #1 dream killer right there
[23:58:33] <sonny> I don't know what happens in the others, except describing waveforms / images
[23:58:54] <sonny> and you don't require scripting for that either

[23:59:23] <pulse> ProfSimm, just start experimenting from the ground :p
[23:59:53] <ProfSimm> pulse: yes, gather empirical evidence first, that I can defy gravity at low altitudes
[23:59:53] <pulse> some comedian once said that it's not a problem that people believe they can fly, the problem is they don't try it on the ground first
[23:59:57] <sonny> vdamewood isn't esperanto a [human] language?
