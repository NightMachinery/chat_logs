[01:29:53] <buttsbot> Richard's Reactor: 110514 - Introduction
[01:29:54] <Brekkjern> So this is a thing
[01:31:42] <Brekkjern> Dude actually tried to make a nuclear reactor. Got shut down a few months into the project
[01:32:03] <defect> oh, i think i remember seeing him in the news
[01:40:50] <moose> He was not actually going to succeed in making one.
[01:41:40] <moose> What he made was a radioactive souffle in a pot.
[01:41:45] <gerikson> busted by Big Nuke
[01:43:14] <Brekkjern> moose: I didn't really expect him to succeed when I opened the link either
[01:43:34] <Brekkjern> But the fact that he actually got his hands on enough of the material and wasn't immediately shut down is somewhat concerning
[01:44:44] <moose> He basically had a bunch of Am-241 from smoke detectors.
[01:45:20] <moose> The danger was chemical toxicity, never ionizing radiation really. Inhalation hazard, probably. But nothing outside of his apartment.
[01:45:52] <Brekkjern> Or melting his own skin with the acids he tried to boil it in
[01:46:03] <moose> You can dismantle those smoke detectors all day long and amass a bunch of Am-241 and wrap it in beryllium to make a strong neutron source.
[01:46:47] <moose> That doesn't do anything really, until you start bombarding thorium with those neutrons. Then, you're breaking most laws in most countries :)
[01:47:34] <moose> But FWIW if you're in the states you can just buy a commercial Am241/Be neutron source that is several magnitudes stronger.
[01:47:43] <Brekkjern> Who would be knocking on your door for doing that in Sweden?
[01:48:55] <moose> Depends on how crazy you got. Police and Swedish radiation safety authority but it could go to a hazmat brigade or even involve IAEA if they didn't enforce laws.
[01:49:52] <defect> apparently he contacted SSM and asked if what he was doing was legal or not :P
[01:49:56] <moose> Most countries have exemptions for certain experimentation and research quantities of materials too. Not sure about Sweden, as I'm in the states.
[01:50:53] <moose> defect: Yeah, he probably wanted attention tbh
[01:51:25] <moose> Nobody calls up and asks frankly and I am willing to bet he used alarming phrases about his methods or quantities somewhere.
[01:53:35] <manicennui> Wasn't there some guy who wrote his thesis on how to create a nuclear bomb and the government confiscated it?
[01:53:57] *** Quits: dcz_ (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[01:54:46] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aristotle_Phillips
[01:54:46] <buttsbot> John Aristotle Phillips - Wikipedia
[01:55:00] <manicennui> "The Federal Bureau of Investigation confiscated Phillips's term paper and a mockup he had constructed in his dormitory room."
[01:55:11] <manicennui> Dr. Frank Chilton, a California nuclear scientist who at that time specialized in nuclear explosion engineering, said Phillips’s design was "pretty much guaranteed to work."
[01:55:56] <Brekkjern> "Work" is a very vague term though
[01:55:57] <manicennui> Wow.
[01:56:11] <manicennui> Then he went on to write creepy software to target voters.
[01:56:26] <manicennui> This was in the 70s/80s mind you.
[01:57:17] <manicennui> "It specializes in combining voter lists with personal data from other sources (such as income, gun ownership or church attendance) and data-mining, to assist with micro-targeting of specific voter groups; as of 2007, its database contained detailed information about ca. 175 million U.S. voters and it had about 100 employees."
[01:57:37] <manicennui> He founded that company in 83 based on this idea.
[01:58:19] <moose> That was some pretty big data back then too
[01:59:13] <manicennui> This is why entertainment always portrays smart people as villains.
[02:00:00] <moose> There's a bigger reason behind that
[02:00:38] <moose> People in power know that the only people who threaten that power are ambitious and intelligent people, so there's a strong interest in creating social exile of the next generation of those people who can challenge the stuff we've always been doing.
[02:01:22] <manicennui> Fucking Maoists!
[02:01:31] <moose> Some rich and powerful dudes are better than others at trying to "promote education" but really they're just promoting those who think alike and create strong bonding sentiment by helping those select few who are susceptible to psychological manipulation
[02:02:08] <manicennui> See the Gates Foundation.
[02:02:14] <moose> Yep. Was saying it without saying it.
[02:02:31] <Brekkjern> It's ambition + capability really. Dumb people can only really start a mob. They will fuck up at some point and it will fizzle out.
[02:02:41] <moose> I was going to hint at the philanthropic causes too. Donate to cure HIV, cancer, etc by the hundreds of millions and most sensible people will not question the source of the funding
[02:03:26] <moose> Capability, IMO, is in most people. Most people are capable of more than they think and they're certainly capable of more than they've already done.
[02:03:59] <manicennui> I don't agree.
[02:04:11] <manicennui> Most people are not capable of much.
[02:04:22] <moose> Are you, though?
[02:04:28] <Brekkjern> Well, my point was that smart people are capable of planning more steps ahead than idiots are.
[02:04:40] <moose> I ask specifically about you not to refute your point based on a personal thing, but often times I find people who think this way are a bit lost in their own ego :p
[02:05:52] <manicennui> Nah. I've had enough "normal" jobs and interacted with enough less smart people to know that it isn't even mostly lack of education.
[02:06:04] <moose> Roughly how old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
[02:06:14] <manicennui> Most people are only capable of following a list of steps, and they'll screw that up sometimes, and they also have no ability to figure out why something goes wrong.
[02:06:15] <moose> I'm about 30 so I'm curious if this is a life experience thing you've got over me.
[02:06:20] <manicennui> moose: 40s.
[02:06:33] <moose> Ah, probably the case then.
[02:07:24] <manicennui> And it's not that smart people never make mistakes or anything like that.
[02:08:06] <moose> Brekkjern: I've wondered if it's more about life experiences than smarts though. Take the very intelligent person who makes a lot of money early in life, but spends it on stupid shit and doesn't save for retirement.
[02:08:25] <Brekkjern> moose: That is just bad impulse control
[02:08:38] <moose> But "smarts" includes control over emotions, to me.
[02:08:54] <manicennui> moose: Impulse control and such are orthogonal.
[02:08:54] <Brekkjern> Eh. It can include that
[02:08:58] <moose> Someone is dumb if they react poorly to a situation, consistently.
[02:09:02] <manicennui> I spent every dime I made in my 20s and half my 30s.
[02:09:03] <Brekkjern> But have you heard the term "Idiot savant"?
[02:09:27] <manicennui> It's not as though I thought what I was doing was the correct thing.
[02:09:29] <moose> I have. I always thought it applied to the savant who could recall the weather and duration of a day for any date in recorded history but didn't have personal skills.
[02:09:34] <manicennui> I knew I should save.
[02:09:38] <manicennui> But fuck future me!
[02:09:55] <moose> manicennui: Pretty much how it's going over here.
[02:10:18] <Brekkjern> moose: But if that knowledge was actually practical, they could go ahead and do something with it, but it wouldn't necessarily put them in control of their emotions
[02:10:23] <manicennui> And if you are in a situation where you don't make enough to save and survive, that doesn't mean you are dumb.
[02:10:50] <moose> manicennui: I agree. But if you are buying $100k cars and end up with $2k in your savings account after, it's pretty dumb.
[02:10:53] <Brekkjern> See for example Elon Musk. The dude is obviously not an idiot and he seems to have some impulse control except for whatever dumb shit he posts on Twitter
[02:11:19] <manicennui> The clearest way I know to explain it is the ability to step through something in your head and determine probable outcomes.
[02:11:25] <moose> The thing that separates Elon Musk's attitude from most is the confidence to try and fail, IMO
[02:11:28] <moose> And in a grand way.
[02:11:31] <manicennui> The ability to reason about a model of the thing, not just memorize bits of it.
[02:11:32] <moose> Billions of dollars? YOLO
[02:11:37] <manicennui> Although smart people obviously memorize shit too.
[02:12:01] <moose> manicennui: Isn't that what "critical thinking" is?
[02:12:05] <manicennui> Even just understanding basic probability.
[02:12:11] <manicennui> Not even from a mathematical standpoint.
[02:12:22] <manicennui> Just "certain things are more likely to have certain outcomes"
[02:12:38] <manicennui> And "there are few things which guarantee certain outcomes".
[02:12:51] <manicennui> We are seeing a lot of that right now.
[02:12:58] <Brekkjern> Also, most things have more than one cause.
[02:13:04] <Brekkjern> That one seems to be hard for people
[02:13:10] <manicennui> People want every preventative measure to be 100% or they consider it worthless.
[02:13:32] <moose> manicennui: Yep and that leads to extreme risk aversion which is detrimental to success
[02:13:42] <manicennui> Yeah, understanding that science is pretty bad with multi-variable problems is useful.
[02:14:03] <manicennui> Which is why typically they try to isolate as many things as possible to focus on a single variable.
[02:14:16] <moose> Right. You see it recently of course.
[02:14:20] <manicennui> But few problems have a single variable, especially things like health.
[02:15:05] <moose> I've seen people talk about "I wasn't around anyone but got COVID the day after the vaccine. The vaccine gave me COVID."
[02:15:13] <manicennui> Or that science is nothing more than the best answer we currently have, and can be mostly wrong!
[02:15:19] <moose> That's a great example of the "things have more than one cause" issue, Brekkjern :p
[02:15:49] <manicennui> That seems more like they are confusing reactions to vaccines with COVID, or they were around other people.
[02:16:03] <moose> I think that people forget you're around other people while getting the vaccine.
[02:16:25] <Brekkjern> moose: Yeah, but try discussing "What causes crime in neighbourhoods with lower economic status" with someone and see how long it takes before you want to bash either your or their head in.
[02:16:26] <moose> It's probably the highest risk interaction most people have heh
[02:16:46] <moose> Brekkjern: Oh god. I am quite familiar :)
[02:16:49] <manicennui> I don't know many people who isolate themselves to the level required to say that there is no chance that they contracted a virus somewhere.
[02:17:00] <manicennui> moose: I don't know about most.
[02:17:07] <manicennui> Most people probably go grocery shopping still.
[02:17:23] <manicennui> I don't know many people who avoid interaction as much as I do.
[02:17:28] <moose> That's true, I'm probably biased due to crazy hermit behavior.
[02:17:33] <manicennui> But I don't need much interaction with other humans.
[02:17:40] <manicennui> I get that other people do.
[02:17:54] <Brekkjern> I'd be driven completely mad if I had to work from home all the time
[02:17:55] <manicennui> I had multiple friends wanting to get together as omicron was flaring up.
[02:18:09] <manicennui> I'm enjoying being permanently remote.
[02:18:13] <moose> Brekkjern: My car dealer mechanic told me they raised their labor rate and I asked why and they explained "matrix pricing" to me and brought up median income of the area as if it was a good reason for jacking up prices.
[02:18:24] <manicennui> Although I don't enjoy being cooped up all the time.
[02:18:31] <manicennui> Which is mostly my own fault.
[02:18:32] <moose> I had to explain that the place with double the median income is lower priced, same company :)
[02:18:38] <manicennui> It's not social interaction that I crave though.
[02:19:54] <moose> I personally just like options. When an option is removed, I tend to want the removed option.
[02:19:55] <Brekkjern> moose: I have no idea what matrix pricing is and googling it does not explain how it relates to a car dealer mechanic?
[02:20:34] <moose> Brekkjern: Matrix pricing is the concept of pricing based on specific geographical location. Competitive prices, income in the area, demographics and results from studies, etc.
[02:20:45] <Brekkjern> Aha
[02:21:05] <moose> Essentially the basis for it is rooted in why you'll find lower quality produce in stores in mostly impoverished neighborhoods
[02:21:14] <moose> Every industry uses it.
[02:21:32] <moose> It's why cigarettes and cheap liquor are marketed in predominantly non-white neighborhoods in the US more aggressively, too.
[02:22:30] <moose> But yeah, it ties into what you were talking about regarding income and crime
[02:31:32] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/ukygewgjwfg81.jpg
[02:31:34] <Brekkjern> This is cursed
[02:31:44] <moose> rofl
[02:31:47] <moose> that's awesome
[02:44:06] <manicennui> https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/injunction-ottawa-granted-1.6342468
[02:44:18] <manicennui> Court grants injunction to silence honking in downtown Ottawa for 10 days
[02:44:31] <manicennui> "Tooting a horn is not an expression of any great thought I'm aware of," said Justice Hugh McLean during a court hearing in Ottawa Monday.
[02:44:33] <manicennui> Burn.
[02:45:31] <manicennui> According to the order, police are now authorized to arrest and remove anyone they believe is aware of the order and is contravening it. They also have the discretion to release anyone from arrest if that person agrees in writing to obey the order.
[02:45:37] <manicennui> So basically nothing will happen.
[02:53:27] <moose> Anyone here use any file hosting sites? Which ones and why?
[02:53:58] <moose> Shit like dropbox and onedrive are free basically so I am curious why anyone would bother basically
[02:59:36] <manicennui> I use dropbox and google drive and pay for more storage on google drive.
[02:59:48] <manicennui> I did not do an exhaustive review before choosing to do this.
[03:00:03] <manicennui> But I'm only paying $2 per month.
[03:00:59] <kline> moose, i use my own, i type `p filename` and it uploads it to paste.mydomain.com/filename
[03:01:13] <moose> right, i do something similar
[03:02:12] <moose> I use google drive or dropbox if it's something work related
[03:02:24] <moose> But for the most part I rarely see anyone using the old school-ish file sharing sites
[03:07:50] <kline> the problem with the old school sites is that they have a tendency to disappear either your files or completely
[03:08:19] <kline> for every 1 that exists, there is a scarred greybeard who mourns for all they data they lost to the 10 filehosts that shutdown
[03:09:04] <kline> think about all those "HOTLINKING DISABLED" or "This user has exceeded their allowance" thumbnails you see

[13:10:22] <manicennui> The DOUBLE OFFICE!
[13:10:30] <manicennui> I assume they never use it.
[13:10:36] <manicennui> You'd quickly realize how lame it is.
[13:10:59] <manicennui> Never use it for actual work that is.
[13:11:09] <gerikson> if you're selling something for double-digit millins, how much does it cost to get a full-home styling?
[13:11:15] <manicennui> Like couples share an office in 2 bedroom apartments because they have to.
[13:11:20] <gerikson> if it increases the price?
[13:11:34] <manicennui> A lot of these places look professionally designed/decorated.
[13:11:37] <manicennui> They are just bad.
[13:11:39] <gerikson> but yeah, much rather have 2 separate offices
[13:11:42] <gerikson> manicennui: agree
[13:12:54] <manicennui> And they almost always look like they were designed to impress other people with questionable tastes.
[13:13:05] <manicennui> They rarely look very functional.
[13:13:49] <manicennui> And there are always a few parts that look like typical suburban cookie cutter trash.
[13:13:57] <manicennui> Like they just ran out of money to do one area well.
[13:15:19] <gerikson> or enthusiasm
[13:16:07] <manicennui> If I had this kind of money I'd buy a good chunk of land, and have a modest house that is designed extremely well.
[13:16:15] <manicennui> 2500 square feet max.
[13:16:25] <manicennui> Smaller if I could fit everything I wanted in less.
[13:16:59] <manicennui> These people probably pay a fortune for cleaning for square footage that they never use.

[13:24:17] <manicennui> With weird windows up high.
[13:24:19] <gerikson> yeah wtf
[13:24:54] <ehammarstrom> manicennui: the fireplace looks really weird with that choice of stone
[13:26:20] <gerikson> if I was to have a fireplace it would be a stove optimized for heat delivery
[13:26:46] <manicennui> I'd do a completely enclosed wood burning stove.
[13:27:18] <manicennui> Enclosed meaning not open flame.
[13:27:21] <manicennui> Free standing though.
[13:27:53] <gerikson> yeah, I don't have a pic handy of ours
[13:27:59] <gerikson> it's ~25 years old
[13:28:22] <gerikson> free standing, soapstone base, then enclosed, then vents relaeasing warm air
[13:28:25] <gerikson> prtty standard
[13:28:45] <gerikson> we hafe a high ceiling but there's a fan to circulate the warm air
[13:29:03] <manicennui> You can get inserts for fireplaces that make them better, but you are still losing most of the heat in the wall and such.
[13:29:34] <gerikson> yeah
[13:29:50] <gerikson> we have a decroative fireplace in the apartment, not worth the squeeze

[13:33:58] <gerikson> yeah but thy don't retain heat as long
[13:34:12] <gerikson> ofc it depends on the room you have

[13:36:59] <manicennui> on
[13:37:00] <gerikson> ok found the hamburger menu
[13:37:57] <gerikson> it's weird, if you want old styling, it's cast iron
[13:38:09] <gerikson> soapstone seems more for "modern" homes
[13:39:10] <gerikson> I don't care about looks that much, I want max efficiency
[13:39:31] <manicennui> Yeah, when I said enclosed, I meant as opposed to open fireplaces where there is just a screen in front of the flame.
[13:39:39] <manicennui> Not actually enclosed in stone.
[13:39:53] <manicennui> But I get why that could be desirable.
[13:40:07] <manicennui> Just prefer the look of the cast iron stoves.
[13:44:34] <gerikson> I gotcha

[13:46:16] <gerikson> I guess the Swedish market is a bit different
[13:48:01] <gerikson> a trad looking stove would be a hard sell for my wife :D
[13:48:19] <manicennui> In the US, your standard contemporary style is a special modern style.
[13:49:48] <manicennui> IKEA is probably most people's main exposure to it.

[13:52:51] <manicennui> "Swedish design is minimalist, with an emphasis on functionality and clean lines. It’s most famous export, IKEA, also places emphasis on democratic design, meaning good, quality design should be accessible to all – especially when it comes to furniture."
[13:55:45] <gerikson> yeah I dunno about that
[13:56:30] <manicennui> I think it's true in the US.
[13:56:43] <manicennui> The furniture that you can buy that is affordable in the US is mostly garbage.
[13:56:51] <manicennui> IKEA is, on average, slightly better.
[13:56:59] <manicennui> I think that is a big part of why it is so popular here.
[13:57:30] <gerikson> I mean it's why it's popular in Sweeden too
[13:57:35] <gerikson> raised the floor quite a bit
[13:57:38] <gerikson> price
[13:57:40] <gerikson> wise
[13:58:02] <gerikson> but you can pay basically anything ... we looked at kinda high-end bathroom furniture
[13:58:13] <gerikson> $4,000 for a washstand cabinet

[13:59:05] <gerikson> we found something online for ~$500

[23:39:17] <gwozniak> Had a design review recently and I was the one critiquing it, for the most part, because my manager asked me to (manager wasn't there)
[23:39:57] <gwozniak> The intern, whose work was being reviewed, was a bit bummed by my feedback, even though I thought it was a good idea.
[23:40:44] <gwozniak> The intern had already written a bunch of code, it turned out, and I asked why something that exists already (and is proven to work) wasn't considered or if it had been looked into
