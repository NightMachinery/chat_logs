[08:46:24] <DeanGuss> Is there an optionally custodial wallet like bluewallet but with better/more features?
[08:46:42] <DeanGuss> I can't even set the invoice expiration date in bluewallet
[08:51:10] <zemzem> DeanGuss: do you run your own node?
[08:51:56] <DeanGuss> No it's just that I want this wallet for a special purpose that I want unconnected from that
[08:52:58] <zemzem> Well running a node would give you every feature youd ever want. Especially if youre running something like c-lightning with RTL interface
[08:53:05] <zemzem> and its just good practice
[08:53:36] <DeanGuss> that's fine and everything
[08:53:47] <DeanGuss> I just don't want this mobile wallet making a lightning channel
[08:54:02] <DeanGuss> can I connect it to my node remotely that already has channels?
[08:54:29] <zemzem> I think you can do something like that with zap
[08:54:53] <zemzem> assuming you have a node
[08:54:58] <DeanGuss> ok thanks I will check it out
[08:58:08] <DeanGuss> wait, zap is jack mallers'?  I thought his crap was kyc

[09:22:49] <DeanGuss> if I generate an invoice I'm giving away my own node's info
[09:23:34] <DeanGuss> If anybody knows of any custodial lightning wallets more feature rich than bluewallet please lmk
[09:24:01] <DeanGuss> zap is cool though, but not what I'm looking for at the moment

[16:10:16] <fordcars> Hi! In transaction inputs, we refer to a previous transaction output. When the miner chooses to include our transaction, does it have to iterate through the *entire* main branch to find the merkle tree containing our transaction to confirm we have enough funds?

[16:30:51] <glix> fordcars: by iterate if you mean going through the whole blockchain data stored on disk, one block at a time, then no. There's an index of utxo's that the node stores, which allows for quick lookup of the inputs mentioned in an incoming transaction..

[18:57:37] <mikrosis> hello
[18:57:41] <mikrosis> so I got me a bitcoin wallet some time ago
[18:57:53] <mikrosis> how can I convert existing money into bitcoin?
[18:58:04] <mikrosis> can I just buy it online and the shop transfers the ownership somehow to me?
[18:58:18] <mikrosis> so I don't want to trade with these btcs, just have some
[18:58:22] <mikrosis> or is trading always better?
[18:59:13] <gribble> you can buy bitcoin from exchanges, and send them to your wallet. make sure you know how to back up and secure your wallet first
[18:59:49] <xx> did... did the bot just understand a human question?
[18:59:59] <mikrosis> cool
[19:00:04] <mikrosis> xx: I guess some pmed it :)
[19:00:24] <mikrosis> backing up and securing a bitcoin wallet... is it worth buying hardware for this?
[19:00:33] <mikrosis> implant? (lol, joking)
[19:00:52] <specing> depends on worth of btc in your position
[19:01:13] <mikrosis> not very much yet
[19:01:23] <mikrosis> what besides bitcoin is a good cryptocurrency?
