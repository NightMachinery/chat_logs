[01:50:07] <pyzozord> I see the linux kernel, which has about seven layers of process "containerization". On top of it, there is a container engine. Like docker. But usually docker actually invokes containerd, which is another container engine. Inside this there are some containers running kubernetes "control plane" processes. But they also run etcd server. And they don't manage containers themselves, they use 
[01:50:13] <pyzozord> kubernetes network plugins, which will do that. Those containers have layerd file systems. They pull images from image repositories. Isinde the kubernetes there can a be another network called a service mesh. That too will run in containers, have it's own services in the "control plane". And also it's own reverse proxy. It will inject this proxy into each container, and manage all traffic between 
[01:50:19] <pyzozord> containers.
[01:50:36] <pyzozord> And that's just for starters, we haven't even installed nginx, which is it's own massive complexity
[01:52:20] <pyzozord> Kubernetes out of the box has about two dozen concepts and imaginary resources. Of course that's not enough, and it's usually extended with extra resources

[02:09:48] <apotheon> duuude: That doesn't project forward very well.  A decentralized blockchain cryptocurrency doesn't require things like fractal financial services intermediaries, civil enforcement, or military enforcement to support.

[02:11:46] <apotheon> BTC itself has lost the plot, anyway.  It's surviving on momentum -- and it might continue to do that into the 2030s -- but without some course corrections it's going to crater eventually.
[02:12:08] <oldlaptop> (It's mildly confusing, because GPUs are sometimes described as "ASICs" - less correct than it used to be, but still reasonable - they are Integrated Circuits that are Specific to the Application of graphics processing)

[02:13:01] <apotheon> jeaye: It doesn't have *that much* momentum.
[02:13:24] <jeaye> :)
[02:13:46] <apotheon> Most of the momentum behind BTC these days can't even conceive of BTC having value that isn't denominated in USD.
[02:13:47] <jeaye> I'm more interested in SOL and NEAR, which are building scalable dapp platforms. Not just riding the wave, like most altcoins.
[02:13:50] <apotheon> That's not a good sign.
[02:14:50] <duuude> are variables in makefiles env variables in child processes?
[02:14:50] <jjido> didn't one of the USD tracking currencies die recently?
[02:14:52] <apotheon> If you want something BTC-ish, there's BCH, which is even becoming a smartchain, but is also technically usable as an everyday currency at present (unlike BTC).  If you want something that can survive regulation, look at Monero.
[02:14:52] <vdamewood> apotheon: I wonder how many people know what a 'satoshi' is.

[02:24:08] <apotheon> davros: Combine that with P2Pool, which decentralizes mining pools, and you've got a blockchain better securable by mining at lower energy usage rates with fewer miner units overall because of the disincentives for centralized industrial mining operations.
[02:24:15] <jeaye> davros: Any of the new scalable blockchains don't have expensive mining, since they use a different form of consensus. So it's no different from running any normal large server on EC2.
[02:24:41] <apotheon> davros: The BTC development direction is so insane it uses insipid justifications for ASICs as if they make anything better.

[05:24:41] <duuude> Sqaure: What is wrong with a random number?
[05:24:52] <InPhase> Sqaure: Encrypted userid is almost always a bad choice because session cookies are frequently used as a proxy for having authenticated.
[05:24:54] <PlanckWalk> I've been out of the loop for years too.  Maybe they went back to encrypted info again.
[05:25:02] <PlanckWalk> But I woudl doubt it
[05:25:10] <InPhase> Sqaure: You would have to revoke the userid if the session cookie leaked.
[05:25:12] <Sqaure> duuude, it would imply sessions. I gathered sessions is web 1.0. =D
[05:26:02] <InPhase> Sqaure: Similarly, you would have to have unguessable userids.
[05:26:13] <InPhase> Sqaure: That is, if the encryption modality leaked.
[05:26:37] <Sqaure> Okok.. ill just go with sessions then
[05:27:23] <InPhase> Sqaure: It's possible in some limited cases to forego authenticated sessions entirely, and simply store the data for the session in cookies.  This works if the data is simple and small.

[06:41:06] <KillerWasp> _0xMsFoxyEmilySm: Pi is still useless. Another useful thing is the table of COS and SIN, in many programs and games this method is still used.
[06:41:10] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> binary is equivalent to 'theres only one particle view of things'
[06:41:49] <KillerWasp> cos, sin, and tan, They are very useful to create 3D.

[06:44:01] <auctus> lol
[06:45:30] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> btw quantum computers / qubits are an *approximation* of Pi computing
[06:45:43] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> but they are only approximation
[06:46:03] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> everything in natural world is a sphere
[06:46:03] <duuude> can mere mortals program quantum computers?
[06:46:18] <Buartawe> duuude: no
[06:46:18] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> its no problem to perfectly approximate Pi in real world. problem lies in human engineering of computer
[06:46:25] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> thats the impedance mismatch
[06:47:15] <duuude> Buartawe: is it impossible math?
[06:47:19] <KillerWasp> i can program quantum computers.

[06:47:53] <KillerWasp> i can. But I do not feel like it.
[06:47:56] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> the problem with qubit is theyre only approximation of Pi
[06:47:58] <Buartawe> duuude: I'm just messing with you
[06:47:59] <duuude> I use a quantum/chemical hybrid computer daily
[06:48:05] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> Pi computing inverts the problem
[06:48:07] * duuude gets messy
[06:48:08] <KillerWasp> like IA also.
[06:48:20] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> it says, problem is with engineering / representation not with computation itself

[06:49:29] <_0xMsFoxyEmilySm> in a way quantum computing cant
[06:49:55] <Buartawe> KillerWasp: So you could program an emulator... But not the real thing

[06:50:58] <Buartawe> "real ones"
[06:51:02] <KillerWasp> Buartawe: But it would serve to create the bases of a quantum computation, and then for about 10 euros you can create the first quantum circuit.
[06:51:12] <Buartawe> I thought complex computers where imaginary ones...

[09:27:21] <Decker> sorry to hear that
[09:27:43] <copier> Decker: got a serial device that i need to basically brute force data to
[09:27:49] <Decker> I'm sure JS would make it cleaner :) 
[09:28:02] <WhO> epony, yes a bit _0xMsFoxyEmilySm 
[09:28:02] <copier> lmao, but does js allow access to serial devices and not make me want to kill myself
[09:28:09] <Decker> brute force as in ?

[13:15:43] <amigojapan> user51: you want the backups to fail?

[13:19:45] <amigojapan> I see vdamewood 
[13:19:56] <vdamewood> user51: If you really want your backup to fail, use Windows' built-in backup tool.
[13:19:59] <user51> sometimes i wonder if the winning strategy is to not have anything to bakcup at all
[13:21:03] <vdamewood> Oh, and if you want to fail, you need to completely avoid Time Machine.
[13:21:15] <amigojapan> user51: some people do full system backups. Which I find silly
[13:21:48] <amigojapan> vdamewood: is zfs like time machine?
[13:22:45] <vdamewood> amigojapan: I'm not very familiar with zfs, but I don't think so. zfs lets you have different versionf of a file in the file system. Time Machine just has date/timestamps on backup files on a separate drive.

This can include load testing as well and sometimes security (although with some companies security it's a separate team)
[18:12:25] <FloridaMan> Whether that be cloud or on-premise, they manage application and delivery infrastructure
