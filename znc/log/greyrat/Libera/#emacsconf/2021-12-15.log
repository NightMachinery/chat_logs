[03:25:23] <rdrg109> zaeph: You mentioned something about subed.el and the subtitles for EmacsConf videos. I understood that you (organizers) are planning to provide information on how someone can contribute by adding subtitles in their languages. Am I right? I'm asking this because I'd like to mention this in the description of the EmacsConf videos at Commons, so that people interested in Emacs can know of this
[03:25:25] <rdrg109> package and your efforts
[04:38:54] <sachac> rdrg109: there are some instructions at https://emacsconf.org/2021/contribute/
[04:39:21] <sachac> doesn't mention other languages specifically, but if you want, you can update it or wait for me to update
[04:56:34] <sachac> rdrg109: do you need help converting to srt? ffmpeg should be able to easily do it.

[08:11:11] <rdrg109> sachac: Thanks! Everything is good so far
[08:11:25] <rdrg109> I've created this text in Commons that will be transcluded in the description of all videos https://w.wiki/4Ywg . Feel free to edit it, add more information
[08:15:48] <sachac> rdrg109: thanks for doing the work! I generally try to make links more descriptive than "here", so maybe the links could be the URL itself, or the sentence could be "You can find this talk and other resources at url.", and the other link could be "Want to help? Check out these ways to contribute." or something like that
[08:26:36] <rdrg109> sachac: Ok! I'll consider that. I've been used to the "here", because I feel it is shorter so I use it in my notes, but not necessarily informative
[08:32:14] <sachac> thanks for considering it. :) When people are using screen readers and tabbing through links, more descriptive links give them better context.
[08:32:50] <sachac> it also gives people a bigger target to click on, which is easier than trying to click on a short word.
