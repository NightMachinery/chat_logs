[01:24:07] <kinghat> it should still be working ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[01:24:32] <kinghat> it makes sense for them to be together, though. if youre already hosting the backend, it might as well serve the frontend.
[01:28:43] <MaxLeiter> kinghat: what if  I want to host the front-end on something like vercel?
[01:28:45] <MaxLeiter> or netlify
[01:28:56] <MaxLeiter> and use their CDN / infrastructure
[01:29:16] <MaxLeiter> i.e.  https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/74daf60aabdce555/image.png 
[01:30:32] <kinghat> ive never used one of those, but isnt everything still rendered server side? couldnt you say the same for TL?
[01:31:05] * xnaas thinks kinghat missed a lot of the original conversation. 
[01:32:06] <kinghat> i mean the basics are you want one container to be able to talk to another container? wherever those are is irrelevant?
[01:32:40] <MaxLeiter> to recap, yes, but I generate some pages at build time (on the client) that require talking to the server (say, to get the welcome message) 
[01:32:45] <xnaas> MaxLeiter's CLIENT Docker image failed to build because part of the node build process requires networking to talk to a potentially dynamic SERVER container. Something about generating some files. 
[01:32:47] <kinghat> xnaas: if you can ELI5 me üòÅ
[01:32:57] <MaxLeiter> so `yarn build` in client needs to talk to a running server 
[01:33:54] <MaxLeiter> https://paste.maxleiter.com/post/95653372-988d-4869-a28c-a6cf77323df9 this is how the client is built/deployed
[01:34:16] <MaxLeiter> https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/89fe903a4ede2190/image.png  it fetches existing posts and builds the pages
[01:35:30] <MaxLeiter> part of the idea is you can also write multiple implementations of the server with a consistent front-end
[01:35:38] <MaxLeiter> i dont want to be tied to node/express
[01:35:56] <MaxLeiter> (and see how that's been a problem for TL) 
[01:40:03] <kinghat> have you tried running the server outside of a container(bare metal) and building the client via its own compose file to see if that works? mebbe the other way around as well. the error a few screens up said connection refused, is it perhaps a CORS issue?
[01:40:37] <MaxLeiter> that would work fine
[01:40:51] <MaxLeiter> but the problem is i want one docker compose for both
[01:41:02] <kinghat> im just saying to single out issues
[01:41:10] <MaxLeiter> but now im thinking ill just make two docker composes and you treat them as completely independent 
[01:41:17] <MaxLeiter> the problem is building is a very different stage from deployment in docker
[01:41:27] <MaxLeiter> afaict what i want is just not possible 
[01:41:31] <MaxLeiter> #docker seemed to agree
[01:44:48] <kinghat> did they say why? i dont understand why one image/container cant talk to the former, especially with depends_on.
[01:45:40] <kinghat> i guess its just when it starts but not when its ready: https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/
[01:45:48] <MaxLeiter> oh, they did say I can use entrypoints 
[01:45:50] <MaxLeiter> maybe
[01:47:02] <MaxLeiter> kinghat: https://github.com/MaxLeiter/Drift/blob/main/docker-compose.yml if you wanna take a swing at it
[01:47:22] <kinghat> also, is this for prod? or just for a dev container?
[02:10:39] <xnaas> you're jumping the gun, kinghat
[02:10:47] <xnaas> we're talking about the image being built, not and end result container
[02:11:07] <xnaas> GitHub Actions, for instance, can't build the $client container with no server to talk to
[02:11:18] <xnaas> s/container/image
[02:11:21] <xnaas> now you got me doing it too
[02:11:22] <xnaas> ü§™
[02:11:32] <xnaas> GitHub Actions, for instance, can't build the $client image with no $server to talk to
[02:11:34] <xnaas> that's better
[02:12:09] <xnaas> Which means that MaxLeiter is either left with redesigning how his entire project works, or just making it a combo container and Deal With It Later‚Ñ¢
[02:14:22] <MaxLeiter> I like the second option
[02:14:27] <xnaas> üòâ
[02:14:36] <xnaas> making $FUTURE_SELF deal with everything is the best
[02:14:42] * xnaas fuckin' hates $PAST_SELF
[02:14:44] <xnaas> :D
[02:18:01] <MaxLeiter> more like $SOMEONE_ELSE can deal with it
[02:18:16] <xnaas> haha
[02:18:25] <MaxLeiter> well hm 
[02:18:31] <xnaas> "If you want it decentralized in Docker, re-write my shit yourself!"
[02:18:32] <MaxLeiter> could I make one big docker container in the root
[02:18:38] <MaxLeiter> Dockerfile *
[02:18:58] <MaxLeiter> more like "this is a really hacky way to do it but it runs"
[02:19:20] <MaxLeiter> because I imagine its possible with the right magic and hackiness 
[02:26:53] <xnaas> if it gets big enough, some nerd'll figure it out
[02:26:55] <xnaas> ü§™
