[02:02:22] <headius> edipo.federle: it would not be difficult but we have been focusing on getting 9.3 features done
[02:03:11] <edipofederle[m]> I see, I am trying to find something to work next... maybe you have some suggestion?
[02:03:13] <headius> Should be able to optimize class vars as well as TR with a little effort
[02:03:20] <headius> Hmm
[02:04:58] <headius> Maybe have a look at the remaining things targeted at 9.3 and something will look good
[02:05:28] <edipofederle[m]> I will check
[02:07:15] <edipofederle[m]> you mean https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+instance+methods+milestone%3A%22JRuby+9.3.0.0%22 ?

[18:50:19] <enebo[m]> you had 'instance methods' in that search
[19:10:36] <headius> Good morning!
[20:32:40] <headius> kares: I have not found a command line I like but it should be mvn -pl base -pl core, both need to build
[20:33:05] <headius> I have taken to just running `mvn` on master... bit slower because it reinstalls lib stuff, which might be why my RG is getting messed up

[23:39:31] <headius> enebo: when you verify a release on Windows, you don't build there right?
[23:39:55] <headius> there is an issue with building on Windows that messes up the bat scripts due to running inside the jruby-9.1.17.0 jar file
[23:39:59] <enebo[m]> never
[23:40:15] <headius> that is not the root cause here but it means those files are messed up for gems installed at build time on Windows
[23:40:24] <headius> only rake in 9.2 but more in 9.3
[23:40:34] <headius> it makes this a little annoying to test
[23:41:00] <enebo[m]> It has not been something I have imagined anyone really bothered to do enough to test it but I do periodically build on windows so I guess I figured we at least made enough
[23:41:20] <headius> the scripts installed when you manually `gem install` something are fine
[23:41:47] <headius> it is just the ones installed during build that are messed up because it is run with 9.1.17.0 and run from the jar rather than using the current jruby dir
[23:44:31] <enebo[m]> headius: Do you know if it is 9.1 or is it from jar which is the issue (or both I suppose)
[23:58:27] <headius> both really
[23:58:52] <headius> 9.2 would generate it a bit differently but they both detect it is running within a jar and produce a multi-argument `java` command line
[23:59:07] <headius> that command line then gets wrapped in quotes by RubyGems and is no longer executable as a single command
[23:59:24] <headius> I just pushed a build patch that I think fixes it
[23:59:31] <headius> https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/6746
