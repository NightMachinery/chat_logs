[00:00:07] <mawk> so what pyzozord ?
[00:00:11] <Twix> <deniska> wasm is already on the level of llvm or gcc intermediate representations <-- yes, of course. But more generic and more standardized
[00:00:14] <mawk> it's an open format, it's not that specific
[00:00:23] <pyzozord> that way all a language needs is to compile to wasm
[00:00:30] <mawk> and IR is made for the purpose
[00:00:33] <pyzozord> and the get support on GCC, llvm etc
[00:00:44] <user51> i wonder what comes after wasm
[00:00:47] <mawk> so it can withstand LTO for instance, profiling, comments, information about other modules, and so on
[00:00:50] <mawk> all that wasm is lacking
[00:00:51] <pyzozord> the language does not need to care about compilers, just wasm
[00:01:00] <mawk> so, conclusion, just use llvm ir with clang
[00:01:00] <Twix> i think you could consider a wasm object as a deliverable executable, like a .jar file. I do not think, that you can exchange the llvm ir between llvm versions
[00:01:08] <mawk> make a llvm ir backend for gcc if you want
[00:01:20] <deniska> isn't the only realistic compiler to wasm around clang and other llvm family? :P
[00:01:23] <mawk> you can't exchange the bitcode between versions probably Twix 
[00:01:27] <mawk> it's the compiled form
[00:01:31] <mawk> but the IR is human readable
[00:01:37] <Twix> yes, i know
[00:01:53] <nomagno> Everything that contains code is a deliverable executable
[00:02:03] <mawk> what

[00:03:30] <pyzozord> mawk the pont is more independent of specific compilers
[00:03:36] <pyzozord> the universal bytecode
[00:03:45] <Twix> like java bytecode \o/
[00:03:54] <mawk> it's not fit for that purpose I think pyzozord 
[00:03:54] <nomagno> There is no such thing as universal bytecode
[00:03:58] <Twix> or erlang vm bytecode \o/
[00:04:04] <mawk> it's universal assembly code if you want
[00:04:10] <mawk> but it's not made for making executables
[00:04:11] <pyzozord> although making ir frontend in gcc, and RTL content in llvm is a good idea too

[00:05:23] <[itchyjunk]> it's dated tomorrow evening
[00:05:24] <nomagno> mawk: Why?
[00:05:28] <pyzozord> i thought clang was just standard c frontend for llvm
[00:05:28] <mawk> you said "Everything that contains code is a deliverable executable"
[00:05:36] <mawk> clang can do more than C

[00:08:25] <nomagno> Executable means that can be executed. You can execute a corrupted enough ASCII representation of the bible, and perhaps on multiple architectures at once if you get lucky. Deliverable for sure!

[00:11:19] <pyzozord> compiling to c feels like cutting the corners

[03:31:46] <apotheon> Elixir seems more *interesting* as a language, but sometimes "interesting" isn't what you need.
[03:33:00] <sonny> it's not just interesting, depending on what you require, it looks to be of the same use as go

[12:52:48] <mawk> to compute π when I first learnt python I drew an eighth of a circle using the sqrt(1-x²) equation, then added up the arc length, then multiplied by 4
[12:52:54] <mawk> is that how you did too arahael ?
[12:53:21] <arahael> mawk: I can't remember, but I do remember that I used an eigth of a circle, and that sqrt(2) was involved in some way.
[12:53:46] <arahael> I basically did it by breaking it down in triangles.
[12:53:55] <mawk> ah so using the area
[12:53:57] <mawk> not the arc length
[12:54:25] <mawk> yeah the eighth of circle has x-coordinate sqrt(2)/2 for its leftmost point

[13:04:54] <arahael> user51: You can't do sqrt on negative numbers, though.
[13:05:06] <mawk> or if I write π = π, there's no ellipsis; but π is transcendental

[15:20:31] <rexar89> actually I mostly use vanija js sprinkled in to traditional  web application to enhance  UX
[15:20:34] <rexar89> :)
[15:21:28] <pyzozord> rexar89 well the downside is that there are more react jobs which means more react code which means more future react jobs
[15:21:36] <rexar89> but for some projects that have very dynamic content. eg a mapping soware that uses google maps with geospatial   data from teh backend, i found it easier to use a js framework
[15:21:39] <nomagno> I don't even know what a traditional web application means
[15:21:53] <pyzozord> on the other hand less angular experts means higher market demand and possibly higher pay
[15:21:59] <nomagno> I make stuff in HTML, then use JavaScript as triggers for DOM actions
[15:22:15] <nomagno> I guess I'm just not very prone to making non-static content
[15:22:31] <rexar89> nomagno: means a web  page that does classic postback tos erver which returns a new page as a response
[15:23:00] <rexar89> and get request that fetch a new page from the server
[15:23:07] <pyzozord> from the technical perspective it doesn't matter, it's just what you prefer. angular is a traditional and opinionated framework complete with dependency injection. React tends to be a set of libraries that you pick and chose

[17:00:32] <getynge> I mean I'm not opposed to runtimes, just magic inside runtimes.  Right now I'm having to contend with an ORM library and getting it to generate sane sql given how our tables are laid out.  I'd skip the ORM entirely but that design decision is out of my hands
[17:01:36] <pyzozord> orms are terrible
[17:01:54] <getynge> They really are

[17:52:37] <merijn> getynge: tbh, even fairly complex stuff, but not based of natural language :p
[17:52:47] <[itchyjunk]> getynge, the code generation is a biproduct of solving some optimization problem
[17:52:56] <getynge> right, but it's still code generation
[17:53:14] <[itchyjunk]> You could say "X is a thing in AI" for any X.
[17:53:17] <simpleton> there is Google with it's AI that writes AI's better than it at writing AI's... there is definitely software generation AI capability, and it isn't public domain just like stock trading and market investing AI technology isn't public domain

[17:56:22] <getynge> Generally speaking you can model most problems as a matter of optimizing for some particular end state.  E.g. you can write a vacuum cleaning AI that solves the vacuuming problem by optimizing for minimal items in a given space, after that you have to program it to detect "items" but the actual moment-to-moment problem solving is still done by the AI
[17:56:26] <[itchyjunk]> "In 1959, Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff of Stanford developed models they called ADALINE and MADALINE. These models were named for their use of Multiple ADAptive LINear Elements. MADALINE was the first neural network to be applied to a real world problem."

[18:02:40] <[itchyjunk]> Improvement is nice but it's not magical.

[18:03:16] <merijn> getynge: tbh, we have gotten pretty good at some pretty niche things, but nothing general

[18:03:47] <[itchyjunk]> You said "AI does the "solving" half"
[18:03:52] <merijn> KillerWasp: I mean, did you see the release of Fallout 76? :p

[18:04:23] <mrig> Flight simulators are my favourite.

[18:04:42] <mrig> merijn yes so I gather, just starting to explore this world now.
[18:04:42] <getynge> I mean I'm not really trying to convince you of anything at this point though, just trying to organize my thoughts really
[18:04:51] <KillerWasp> It is probably one of the many modern games that I do not remember because I have discarded and forgotten them from youtube.
[18:04:58] <getynge> because you are absolutely right [itchyjunk] AI is a lot less impressive than my phrasing has made it out to be that's for sure
[18:05:01] <merijn> mrig: Did you play Undertale? Rimworld? Stardew Valley?
[18:05:13] <[itchyjunk]> Not yet, at least
[18:05:27] <mrig> nope, I've not really been following gaming for some time.
[18:05:27] <[itchyjunk]> in the future, it might very well reach to a state that triggers singularity
[18:05:42] <[itchyjunk]> I mean transformers are impressive.
[18:05:51] <[itchyjunk]> Deepming won the protein folding compitition with those
[18:05:51] <merijn> mrig: Most of those are pretty old by now, like 2015 or something
[18:06:14] <KillerWasp> Undertale might be a good game, but sadly it's on steam.
[18:06:16] <getynge> When I said "AI does the solving half" I was more talking about in the sense of boxcar2d and the like.  We create a model and then the AI "solves" the problem by optimizing for whatever we need it to optimize for.  But the thing we optimize for is usually something very simple like a single number going up or something
[18:06:17] <[itchyjunk]> and OpenAI's GPT-3 is what drives the "open pilot" or w/e it's called that helps in code generation
[18:06:38] <mrig> I started a 2D dungeon/world scroller type thing, an indi game I think, a while back but did not bother with it for long.
[18:06:53] <[itchyjunk]> getynge, "solution" in optimization generally revers to global values
[18:06:58] <[itchyjunk]> global minima or maxima
[18:07:13] <[itchyjunk]> when your model finds some "acceptable" minima, it's generally not called "solved"
[18:07:15] <getynge> yup, that's exactly how boxcar2d works for example, hence why I reached for that
[18:07:21] <getynge> oh yeah that's fair
[18:07:22] <mrig> must did out the name of that, it was just using too much juice for what it was, and I got a mental block about that.
[18:07:28] <[itchyjunk]> like deepmind doesn't claim they "solved" Go game.
[18:07:43] <[itchyjunk]> Mearly found good approximation to high win states
[18:07:48] <mrig> s/did/dig/
[18:07:57] <[itchyjunk]> Which some AI's do claim to solve chess.
[18:08:04] <Jong> [itchyjunk]  do you understand BERT, transformers, and multi-head attention? Have any experience with NLP?
[18:08:36] <getynge> Yeah so I guess solution was a bit of a strong word
[18:08:37] <[itchyjunk]> I understand them as any layman understand them.
[18:08:52] <[itchyjunk]> yes maybe you used solution differently
[18:08:58] <getynge> that's kinda on me, I'm using technical terminology in a non-technical way
[18:09:04] <[itchyjunk]> for example, PDE's generally don't have solutions, just numerical approximations
[18:09:44] <getynge> When I say the word "solve" what I actually meant was "reach an acceptable but not necessarily ideal end state" but that's much more verbose
[18:10:11] <getynge> and even then simple AI can't do that, a problem of which I am well aware
[18:10:32] <[itchyjunk]> see, pre AlexNet in 2012, i think the "solve" was defined as anything above 70% accuracy or somesuch
[18:10:47] <Jong> getynge  I think "solve" has a special technical meaning in the context of solving games
[18:10:55] <[itchyjunk]> and i think the "deep" in DNN's pushed it to 80%+ so the solve was above 90%
[18:11:04] <[itchyjunk]> and now solve is anything about 99.99%

[18:47:15] <getynge> My laptop has a system manager utility that can only control some core laptop functionality from windows, I need to find a way to change those settings that system manager uses from linux.

[19:17:59] <simpleton> binary is not 1's and 0's. It's current or no current. true or false. on or off... 1's and 0's are a human notation, specifically arabic in it's heritage

[19:18:33] <[itchyjunk]> Mr mathematical genius
[19:18:34] <apotheon> . . . so it's ones and zeroes after all, because notation is how one expresses the underlying ideas.

[19:50:55] <nomagno> novns: Well yeah, you can choose to support some Linux platforms, that's reasonable. But I think proprietary software is fairly immoral anyways, so I see that as an advantage to FLOSS, not a detriment to Linux

[19:51:18] <mrig> pretty sure that unix was heavily influenced by others though too, turtles all the way down :)
[19:51:48] <novns> nomagno, some things can be proprietary only, because you cannot develop them as hobby projects

[20:20:37] <[itchyjunk]> you're saying it's okay when courts decide what you think is right and not when they decide what you think is wrong.
[20:20:44] <[itchyjunk]> you either believe in legal system or you don't.
[20:20:52] <[itchyjunk]> you can't cherry pick the only things you like.
[20:20:57] <[itchyjunk]> that's how you get dictatorship
[20:21:12] <Raziel> I do think the current implementation of copyright laws can be quite dumb. and many times they're far more in favor of big corporations rather than individual creators (be they coders or musicians or whatever else)
[20:21:18] <tangy> either or?
[20:21:20] <getynge> As with all things, in my opinion, there are lines.  There is certainly a line you can cross where selling software starts being a measurably bad thing, my stance as to the intellectual property considerations surrounding software has a lot of details and caveats though
[20:21:29] <nomagno> [itchujunk]: How can I not make a moral argument? I can not hold 400 messages in my head at once, but if I started saying 'My stance is X is wrong', that's quite obviously not an objective fact
[20:21:41] <nomagno> I'm not arguing against selling

[20:23:17] <getynge> So that's where the nuance comes in for me.  Proprietary software is perfectly fine, but I also think there's such a thing as being "too proprietary"

[23:45:19] <we3fan> Hi guys, I have SSD, CrystalDiskInfo says:
[23:45:19] <we3fan> ID: B1,   Attribute Name: Wear Leveling Count,   Current: 99,   Worst: 99,   Threshold: 0,   Raw Values: 000000000008
[23:45:33] <we3fan> I was just curious, for "Wear Leveling Count", this number 8, what does it mean? Will this number 8 change over time? Or it will stay the same?
[23:45:54] <user51> some inspiration for pattern generation :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KfSdOhgMvk

[23:50:06] <pyzozord> we3fan: there is #hardware channel, they might know more there
[23:51:57] <tvm> we3fan: that number should generally get lower, but i every vendor uses it in different way i guess

[23:52:46] <tvm> we3fan: i have 75% on this SSD on Windows on a drive that still has plenty of life, but it will get lower over time
[23:53:19] <tvm> so maybe it's inverse on your device/vendor

[23:54:06] <dan_pena> hello guys
[23:54:13] <pyzozord> tvm: how do you check that?
[23:54:19] <dan_pena> do you guys know coderbyte?
[23:54:41] * kveroneau admits they don't know what a codebyter even is.
[23:54:46] <tvm> pyzozord: i have some Kingston app, but there's crystal disk info app that should give you same data

[23:54:48] <dan_pena> I have a job technical test that is based on coderbyte, so I have some question
[23:54:56] <tvm> they just read SMART data, on linux it's doable with smartctl
[23:55:04] <pyzozord> oh, I thought there is some linux command
[23:55:22] * kveroneau believes that there is a Linux command for everything is life.
[23:55:56] <tvm> pyzozord: smarctl is linux userspace app that reads SMART data from hdd
[23:55:57] <pyzozord> like hwls or something
[23:56:08] <tvm> chances are that you have it
[23:56:08] <pyzozord> s/hwls/lshw/
[23:56:14] <tvm> or just apt-get it
[23:56:26] <tvm> but the data can be cryptic at times
