TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[09:48:58] <sale> hello. I'm having trouble setting up bond (802.3ad mode) on Debian 11. I'm unable to configure network bonding using /etc/network/interfaces configuration file. This is my configuration (slave interfaces are not mentioned because I tried that first, but it didn't work). https://pastebin.com/A6JdNWTv
[09:49:50] <sale> weirdly, configuring the same 802.3ad bond works without issues if I follow the systemd-networkd method https://wiki.debian.org/Bonding#Using_systemd-networkd
[09:50:47] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[09:51:37] <sale> by "doesn't work", I mean that everything appears to be UP, but I'm unable to ping gateway or anything beyond that
[09:53:35] <sale> ip link shows all slave interfaces UP with correct association with master bond0 interface. bond0 interface is UP, it has correct IP, netmask, gateway. Default ip route is present too. Even /proc/net/bonding/bond0 shows "mii status: up" for all interfaces
[09:54:05] <somiaj> if networkd works, why not just use that?
[09:54:56] <somiaj> sounds like it is something subtle that isn't configured correctly, though I can't think of what it could be.

[09:56:11] <somiaj> one thing I do notice is you have 'auto bond' not 'auto bon0' to match the configuration you have there
[09:57:02] <sale> somiaj: yeah, that's an typo I made on pastebin. The config file has correct interface name
[09:57:45] *** Joins: rundown (~eb0t@90.208.41.2)

[09:58:51] <somiaj> anyways I don't know enough (or really anything) about bonding to be of any real help. My suggestion is if networkd works, just use that, no reason to use the interfaces file.

[10:00:18] <sale> yeah, I wish to use "default" network configuration method (or NetworkManager via nmcli method), because that's what we use in our company and we've already automated network configuration. We really don't need a 3rd way of configuring stuff, especially because this should just work :)
[10:01:07] <somiaj> That is reasonable, though networkd is available by default in debian, just needs to be configured. Anyways, I do understand not wanting different ways.
[10:01:46] <somiaj> maybe someone else can give better help, check back in a few hours if you don't get any answer. I can't really be of much help outside of what I quickly glanced at in the wiki

[18:18:05] <abff> I have a question about wine. I have a PE32 exe that I need to run under wine, so wine requires me to add the i386 architecture to dpkg, and then install a special version of wine. Is there any way I can ensure apt will ONLY install packages from the i386 architecture iff it's related to wine32
[18:18:11] <abff> and about apt, I guess
[18:18:54] <jelly> apt only does what you ask it to
[18:19:25] <abff> how do I politely ask apt to always prefer x86_64 packages except when dependencies of wine32
[18:19:36] <jelly> you don't have to
[18:19:50] <jelly> they are not alternatives
[18:20:23] <abff> idk I had another machine and it was inundated wiht i386 packages everywhere when there was perfectly useable amd64 stuff
[18:20:44] <abff> which is why I have avoided adding that arch to dpkg for years
[18:20:55] <abff> and now you're telling me I'm crazy
[18:21:23] *** Joins: r2rien (~r2rien@2a01:cb19:8ecc:6d00:26c0:edfb:8b85:ef27)
[18:21:24] <jelly> if you want to install anything from an enabled foreign architecture, you specify packagename:arch; just "packagename" won't install anything from i386
[18:21:44] <abff> is that like using --force-architecture in dpkg?
[18:21:57] <jelly> it's not.  There's no forcing involved.
[18:25:31] <jelly> oh, there's a way that "apt install packagename" will install something from a foreign arch, that happens, I think, if "packagename" does not exist in native arch at all but it exists in an enabled foreign arch
[18:25:45] <jelly> that's how you're able to "apt install wine32"
[18:25:54] <abff> right
[18:26:00] <abff> I guess I should just
[18:26:11] <abff> enable the arch, install wine32
[18:26:16] <abff> and disable it immediately
[18:26:29] <abff> probably never get updates but who cares its a one time thing
[18:27:06] <PMT> or just...leave it enabled, and if it becomes an issue, look into it further?
[18:27:27] <abff> ah see it was an issue once, this is why I'm looking into it further now :P
[18:28:58] <PMT> Yes, but you don't have any way of investigating what happened then, unless you still have the old system's logs, and the problem hasn't occurred again yet, that you've mentioned, so we can't really prove something won't ever happen.

[19:59:12] <SwK> when pxe booting into a preseed install, I need to disable the mpt3sas kernel mod during install so that the correct SATA drives are picked of OS mirror, but not have it blacklisted/disabled when the system boots normally off the internal SATAs, but deb installer seems to want to grab all the kernel args supplied via PXE. anyone have a good hint on how to do via preseed or is it really just go ahead and sed the grub.cfg and reinstall grub on first boot then reboot
[19:59:12] <SwK> again and have a "second boot" process that runs to setup mass storage...
[20:00:10] <SwK> well I guess I could just modprobe the mpt3sas module via modules.conf
[20:00:39] <PMT> You could also go match the disk name from /dev/disk/by-id/ or by-path/ ?
[20:02:01] <PMT> Perhaps. I've never had occasion to actually try that.
[20:06:22] <SwK> lol if only the deb installer would play nice that way, plus things like enclosure numbers seem to not be consistent across 4 boxes I'm testing on so id and path differ slightly. just disabling the LSI HBAs leaves the boot disks on the mobo's built in SATA ports as sda and sdb. thats all I could come up with so far
[20:07:46] <SwK> plus disk by id you gotta know things like disk serial ahead of time
[20:09:25] <infinity> somiaj: so i thought that might fix it but this is the issue i'm having. https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/1447. Maybe my issue is not the driver.
[20:10:41] <PMT> SwK: if it let you match on regex, you could get away with it, but sure, if that's the easiest solution.

[20:15:02] <SwK> yeah I dont see anything that allows regex matching on those in the preseed config
[20:16:15] <SwK> even then, that could be more trouble than its worth from a deployment perspective, sure we try to get the same drives all the time, but what happens when this is stull being used a year or 2 down the road, theres a diff model or a firmware upgrade that changes the drive id output
[20:19:30] <PMT> sure, which is why I'd have suggested /dev/disk/by-path/onboard-sata/... if you could get away with it.

[22:04:05] <PMT> If it's just a one-shot, or for initial transfer, I'd probably tar | ssh | tar or netcat, then rsync to update later. Actual bidirectional sync where changes happen on either side is much, much harder.
[22:04:06] <somiaj> rsync does keep things in sync, though front ends can sometimes be useful vs manually writting your own script with all the correct flags.
[22:04:38] <somiaj> I should maybe look into borgbackup, I just end up writing a bunch of cron jobs that manually call rsync
[22:05:06] <busch> PMT, sync. The source system changes while the data is beeing transfered to the destination
[22:05:26] <x10d> busch: in that case: syncthing
[22:05:27] <busch> x10d, Interesting software. I will consider it
[22:05:27] <PMT> (The reason I'm suggesting tar is that IME, rsync can be very, very slow at doing things like lobbing 12 million files all or mostly new.)
[22:06:15] <somiaj> If the data is activally being modified during the copy, you may find a local snapshot/copy first, then copy the the copy over the internet might be more useful for that use case.
[22:06:16] <PMT> busch: I should have been more clear. "much, much harder" was "if you want to find a way to reconcile the source AND destination both being able to make modifications and not just clobbering one with the other."

[22:53:21] <kittonian> hi all. is anyone good with nextcloud? i've tried asking in the nextcloud channel and no one is responding
[22:58:08] <PerfDave> kittonian: What problem are you having?
[23:00:08] <kittonian> i've had nextcloud running on an old deb server for a while now and i'm bringing up a new server that is docker based and trying to figure out how to get my nextcloud to come up exactly as it was on the old server. i've already moved all the data, done the proxypass stuff in apache, etc. that's all good but i can't get the dashboard to display. it keeps throwing error messages. plus, if I allow rw access to docker-compose volume
[23:00:08] <kittonian>  for the apps directory it overwrites the entire directory when the container boots

[23:01:44] <PerfDave> What are the error messages, and where is Apache running?
[23:01:45] <kittonian> there's a custom-apps directory in this new nextcloud that i haven't seen before, but I really just want it to come up without any modification to how it was on the old server and I can't figure out why that's not working
[23:02:05] <kittonian> apache is running in a separate container and proxypassing to the nextcloud container. that all works just fine
[23:02:30] <kittonian> all the data in pgsql has been moved over to the new pgsql container
[23:02:48] <kittonian> and the entire nextcloud directory from the old server has been moved over to the new server
[23:03:24] <kittonian> in the docker-compose.yml file i have volume entries mapping the config, apps, and data directories to the actual directories I want to use so that they are not overwritten when nextcloud is upgraded
[23:04:29] <kittonian> the current apache error msg is AH01102: error reading status line from remote server nextcloud
[23:08:15] <sussudio> maybe nextcloud isn't running. have you check the logs

[23:16:26] <sussudio> why am i even argueing.
[23:17:17] <PMT> sussudio: the thread you linked is about following a guide for Collabora, which is why they got the false impression that's required for it to be relevant, I believe.

[23:19:19] <greycat> if I were setting up a thing that talks to other things, and I got the message "error reading status line from remote server xyzzy" I would figure out what status line they're talking about, and how to retrieve it, and I would attempt to retrieve it by hand.  And see what happens.

[23:20:30] <kittonian> my guess at this point is that it is not properly connecting to the database
[23:20:48] <kittonian> the nextcloud.log is talking about oracle for some reason, even though the config.php specifically states pgsql
[23:21:04] <kittonian> and the pgsql mod in compiled in for php in the nextcloud container
[23:21:51] <kittonian> but the line that says dbhost is where you tell it where to look for the database and it used to say localhost:1234 but now since postgres is running in it's own container called postgresd i changed that line to read postgresd:1234
[23:22:21] <kittonian> but i'm very new to docker and perhaps this is not the correct way to tell it where the database is

[23:35:20] <miromoto> sussudio, you mean is bee
[23:35:33] <sney> you could look up the ip blocks for RIPE and whitelist only those. there would be exceptions, as sussudio mentioned, but the bulk of non-european traffic would not get through
[23:36:00] <miromoto> sussudio, you mean is better so allow one ipv4 as block > 4,000,000,000 adresse?
[23:36:22] <sussudio> https://www.nirsoft.net/countryip/at.html is one source. you could just block the range of whoever is bothering you.
[23:37:57] <greycat> miromoto: could you tell us the overall goal here?  Is it about performance?  Is it about monetary payments?  Is it about abuse?
[23:38:55] <sussudio> "austria" is not after you, unlike china.
[23:39:18] <n4dir> if you follow the actual news ... i'd prefer to exclude austria ... ha ha ha
[23:39:39] <miromoto> greycat, I imagine to increase the security
[23:39:42] <sussudio> i rarely see users from austria, but when i do, they're not nice.
[23:39:56] <miromoto> n4dir, austria was an example ;)
[23:40:23] <n4dir> sorry for the lame joke. It added no insight at all (the "example" part was kinda clear)
[23:40:52] <sney> whitelisting only a specific region, if you're only serving that 1 region, is not usually necessary but it's also understandable
[23:41:11] <miromoto> in my case I need allow only german ip adresses ... but I think is not better as austria ;)
[23:41:40] <sney> the problem is that there will be fuzz in network ranges between the countries. particularly in EU where you have providers crossing borders, etc
[23:41:53] <sussudio> i have blocked many dtag ranges, as they made a mess of routing and are an annoyance.
[23:41:54] <sney> whitelisting RIPE would be fine and fairly straightforward
[23:42:17] <sney> as long as your trouble botnets aren't also in RIPE then you'll basically have your solution there
[23:42:49] <miromoto> sney, I need xtables-addons?
[23:44:04] <sney> I don't know what that is. but this is something you can implement in any firewall without extra tools. step 1: get the list of ip blocks step 2: tell your firewall to allow incoming traffic from those segments step 3: block everything else
[23:44:40] <miromoto> sney, thank you, I will try it
[23:44:47] <sney> for specific usage, you can google e.g. "ufw block subnet"
[23:44:55] <sney> or drop, etc
[23:45:11] <miromoto> on last another question - Is it still common to move the SSH port from 22 to another? Idea is of course again to reduce automated attacks
[23:45:34] <sney> yes, it doesn't have an effect on security, but it usually reduces the spam in auth.log
[23:46:13] <sney> for ssh it is also wise to restrict traffic to only trusted subnets, like your home connection. make sure you have another way in, if you are on a dynamic connection
[23:47:48] <ghormoon> hi, is there in some debian version curl package that can do --negotiate? or i;d need to build it?
[23:47:51] <miromoto> It is annoying that it is expensive to get static IP address as privat user
