[02:26:10] <fredi> hi. I'm having some issues, being oddly redirect from/to places shouldn't to and so. is here the right place for asking help along these lines? if so, I'll provide the specifics

[02:40:47] <t4nk_freenode> fredi, let us think a while on that, to make absolutely sure
[02:41:11] <t4nk_freenode> then we'll let you know if you got the go-ahead to provide any specifics
[02:41:15] <t4nk_freenode> *cough*
[02:41:17] <t4nk_freenode> ;)
[02:43:42] <t4nk_freenode> then we'll convene behind the scenes to determine which of us in this room will be appointed to examine those specifics
[02:44:04] <t4nk_freenode> after 3-5 bi-monthly voting sessions...
[02:44:05] <fredi> one of those issues happens frequently enough for me to already have recorded
[02:44:10] <fredi> https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x86vtgn
[02:46:22] <t4nk_freenode> mmmzz.. is it me, but I can't read a single letter on the screen
[02:49:06] <fredi> it's not you. i'll check the video locally and if it's fine reupload on yt
[02:49:20] <t4nk_freenode> you're on some wikipedia site
[02:49:26] <t4nk_freenode> then I see some darts player
[02:50:11] <fredi> I'm reuploading it (mpv shows it fine) but
[02:51:50] <fredi> t4nk_freenode  you notice at the beginning the opening of another tab for wikipedia whereas the one which had it up to then just redirected to somewhere else
[02:52:46] <fredi> I'd try and figure out myself in a normal day... but today ain't one, and not for a while

[02:53:52] <t4nk_freenode> well, I don't think that's quite normal
[02:54:00] <fredi> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koIPEYJ18Nk
[02:54:01] <t4nk_freenode> what kind of OS are you on?
[02:54:18] <fredi> Ubuntu 20.04
[02:54:35] <fredi> Linux logos 5.11.0-44-generic #48~20.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 14 15:36:44 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[02:56:57] <t4nk_freenode> seems like adware somehoq
[02:57:00] <fredi> those stuff usually relate with my having clicked something I shouldn't have
[02:57:01] <fredi> yes
[02:57:07] <t4nk_freenode> somewhow
[02:57:19] <fredi> t4nk_freenode  any hints for where to start looking?
[02:57:32] <fredi> .cache? .config/whatever/firefox?
[02:58:01] <t4nk_freenode> no, not really, I'm no expert, but I'm reading https://www.myantispyware.com/2016/07/05/remove-adrunnr-com-pop-up-ads-instructions/ now
[02:58:25] <t4nk_freenode> if you stick around for a bit longer, someone might chip in with some suggestions
[02:59:47] <t4nk_freenode> " This adware is bundled within the installation packages from Softonic, Cnet, Soft32, Brothersoft or other similar web sites. So, when you will install a free program that you need, the adrunnr.com will be installed automatically too." could this be?
[02:59:47] <fredi> t4nk_freenode  thanks, I'll wait and see
[03:00:10] <t4nk_freenode> installed some software
[03:00:25] <fredi> well, being on linux I don't actually install programs in a way that causes said trouble
[03:01:10] <fredi> it must have come from clicking wrong place
[03:01:58] <t4nk_freenode> there's a point 6. suggesting you 'refresh firefox'
[03:02:35] <fredi> what is it? surely it's not about F5 I suppose
[03:03:14] <t4nk_freenode> from the hamburger menu , click help then under troubleshooting information you can choose refresh firefox
[03:04:30] <fredi> before I do that, what should happen? I'm asking because if possible would like to retain some data
[03:05:48] <t4nk_freenode> well, if you want, you can always backup your profile folder first, just copy it with firefox closed
[03:05:54] <t4nk_freenode> then you'll lose nothing
[03:06:34] <t4nk_freenode> https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings
[03:06:41] <t4nk_freenode> it's not too bad though
[03:09:52] <fredi> well... I disabled an extension and the issue seems to be resolved...
[03:10:04] <fredi> no way to be sure for a while
[03:10:11] <fredi> t4nk_freenode  thanks for helping

[11:31:14] <ede> how to i delete ytdl-org.github.io/ from the history?
[11:31:27] <ede> it really sucks to start typing a url, press enter and then get a 404 all the time
[11:34:17] <ede> same for ytdl.org/. also appears in the suggestions though it's a redirect only so it's only annoying to have it there messing up "suggestions"
[11:35:00] <ede> when that list hangs down from the urlbar i can shift+del, the urlbar is empty then and the entry is gone from the list, but when i search again they all are back.

[21:17:27] <Timvde> ede: it opens the settings in another window if it was already open there
[21:17:32] <Timvde> You can only have one settings page open at the same time
[21:18:51] <Timvde> ede: do you have Amazon and Ebay on your new tab page?
[21:19:27] <ede> Timvde: it wasn't. definitely not. i use that other (resized and positioned) window for a streaming site only. video runs maximized in it, if not fullscreen. it is dedicated.
[21:20:03] <ede> "important pages", yeah. with the additional text "sponsored". hmm.
[21:20:51] <Timvde> Remove them from there and I think they should be removed from your search suggestions in the address bar as well

[21:22:14] <ede> i'm pretty sure i didn't change the setting (it's still a temporary profile and i don't even want to really optimize it to my needs) but also that i didn't see those entries in the list so far

[21:23:24] <ede> even tracking URLs, nice
[21:24:59] <ede> i even didn't remove pocket, but its "sponsored content" was turned off. another thing to check when i feel like doing so.
[21:28:18] <ede> aldo odd: when i press F6 twice in :preferences i still can't navigate with the keyboard but i get a dotted line on top, left, bottom. not on the right, maybe because of the scrollbar.
[21:28:47] <ede> and on top it's not there over the width of the actual content, only over the sidebar and the empty space on the right.
