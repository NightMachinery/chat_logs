[14:26:05] <gilberth> I have a bold idea. Why not just let TeX typeset dpANS as usual, but insert \special{} in those macros whose semantics I want to carry over. Then read the DVI and reassemble lines and paragraphs. Those \special{}s pop up in the DVI in the middle of a line, right where they are in the TeX input, just like a character. Then I'd do \def\term#1{\special{(term}...<original stuff>...\special{)}} and be set.
[14:38:38] <gilberth> Then I could disable hyphenation and set the font to cmtt to get rid of ligartures and kerning.

[17:08:09] <mfiano> In other news, I'm stumped. I've been papering over several (bad) ideas for several days regarding an abstraction for representing data efficiently in a graphics simulation.
[17:08:49] <mfiano> It makes me want to quit programming when I feel this dumb for this long. How do you all get through this, or does it only happen to me? :/
[17:09:30] <hayley> Once beach "comforted" me by saying his incremental parsing data structure (I think) took ten years to come up with.
[17:10:49] <mfiano> Wow
[17:11:59] <mfiano> I think I need some external ideas.
[17:12:14] <hayley> This was right about at the local minima of confidence in inventing 42nd at Threadmill, where I realised I just discovered false sharing.
[17:15:28] <mfiano> My plan is to do mostly cellular automata and constraint propagation algorithms on large grids in near real-time, with cells possibly close to the pixel level, and whose data is some arbitrary standard instance.
[17:15:56] <mfiano> Where "large" may be infinite, but only a portion is viewable/scrollable on screen
[17:16:26] <hayley> Right. What have you found hard to design for? I'm not entirely familiar with the domain.
[17:17:20] <mfiano> Good separation of concerns and overall good design without totally ruining acceptable performance. I am very picky about code quality heh
[17:17:45] <mfiano> I want extensibility, not some ad-hoc thing that I have to modify constantly
[17:17:46] * hayley nods
[17:18:37] <hayley> I heard of hashlife for Conway's Game of Life, and iirc stylewarning implemented it too. Would memoization like that help?
[17:19:12] <mfiano> I think I have heard the term before, but I would have to go read about it
[17:23:43] <hayley> That said, memoization isn't very "real time" in that latency can vary wildly. But apparently you can simulate ridiculously fast with hashlife, probably as it exploits a sort of temporal locality with repeated patterns. So YMMV as usual.
[17:23:52] <mfiano> Yeah I think that is too specialized for Life
[17:24:50] <mfiano> It actually exploits temporal and spatial coherency if I am understanding it correctly
[17:28:58] <mfiano> Currently I'm trying to decide if I want 2x2 or 3x3 chunks
[17:31:49] <mfiano> With 2x2, I mean the starting configuration would have 4 adjacent screen-sized chunks of data positioned such that the corner they all share is at screen center, so half of each chunk is off screen, and then erase/add chunks depending on how far you scroll on whatever axis
[17:32:14] <mfiano> vs a 3x3 version, where central chunk is the size of the screen and positioned exactly on the screen
[17:56:20] <hendursaga> mfiano: I assume you've looked at Golly before?

[18:05:54] <mfiano> hendursaga: Wave Function Collapse, a constraint solver useful for generating locally similar images. Think of it as a Sudoku solver to the max
[18:06:34] <hendursaga> Still, Golly has some good, optimized algorithms you'd want to take a look at..
[18:06:43] <hayley> Unrelated, Baker claims in a footnote "Although CDR-coding is currently out of fashion due to not being required by Tak and 8Queens, the inexorable pressure to reduce off-chip bandwidth will force its revival."
[18:06:46] <hayley> Any day now.....
[18:10:41] <mfiano> hehe

[21:59:49] <mfiano> It appears our pets explored the lawn during cubensis season again.
[22:03:44] <gilberth> hayley: My cdrcoding benchmark confirms that. In 2003 I measured a turn-around at a list length of 30k elements, while now I have that at tiny lists of 500 elements already. For 500 elements I traverse these at 40% time needed for normal cdrs. While the "AMD Athlon(tm) XP 1600+" in 2003 needed 154% the time for cdr-coding. The turnaround kicked in at 30k and peeked at 23% needed for 50k.
[22:04:43] <gilberth> Thus: I wonder, whether 32-bit or perhaps 48-bit pointers would be faster than full 64-bit pointers.

[22:07:56] <gilberth> Long time ago I made a few "real" CL benchmarks, mostly compiling stuff with CMUCL an machines ranging for a 486 to said Athlon. And what I found was that the speed increase was less than the clock rate increase. I should have kept those benchmarks. However that would also indicate that we are much more bandwidth restricted than clock rate restricted. DRAM really didn't get faster with time.
[22:11:57] <gilberth> This would also explain why read barriers have almost zero costs. These days. I guess, I have to adjust my idea of what is fast and what is slow. Used to be way easier to estimate at a time with no caches and no TLBs, and in-order execution. Dammit, I am olde.
[22:12:18] <humasect> l1/l2 cache etc ?
[22:12:43] <gilberth> ?
[22:12:53] <pjb> And things can change, so we should probably do something like the linux kernel, which is to benchmark algorithms for which speed is important and select the best one for the current machine.
[22:13:11] <humasect> gilberth: instead of 1kb cache we have like 4mb on chip
[22:14:07] <pjb> New architectures often pack some more RAM close to the processors.
[22:14:34] <gilberth> humasect: Yes, a five hundred times the RAM my first machine had, and one-tenth of the capacity of my first hard disk. But pointers are also four times as long.

[22:14:51] <gilberth> pjb: That idea would call for JIT.
[22:14:52] <humasect> hehe
[22:14:53] <humasect> page it
[22:15:14] <pjb> gilberth: well, it'd be more a configuration at initialization time.
[22:15:54] <humasect> i was just reading about octal and hex. i've always been fine with using power of 2 (64,256,etc) with base 10
[22:16:05] <pjb> I guess that depend what kind of compiler you have, indeed.  So loading fasl files would indeed some JIT.
[22:16:18] <gilberth> pjb: A hypothetical JITing CL could perhaps be configured once.
[22:16:41] <pjb> humasect: but it's easier when you do bit banging to think in base 8 or 16.
[22:17:02] <pjb> humasect: the masks are obvious in those bases.
[22:17:24] <gilberth> Anyhow, bbl, chores waiting.
[22:26:22] <humasect> pjb: yeah =)
