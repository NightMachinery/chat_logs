[01:18:31] <simcop2387> sigdie can't do that at all

[04:10:11] <simcop2387> gordonfish: yes actually.  it's slower because there's a bunch of optimizations and such that modern cpus disable when you turn that mode on.  you also can't use sse and above automatically too
[04:10:45] <gordonfish> xenu: Yeah code (especially XS code) on CPAN is not something I quite considered, though isn't the onus on module makers to check for things like type sizes rather than just assuming?

[04:13:24] <LeoNerd> Hah "80"bit floats
[04:13:59] <LeoNerd> You know they're only 79 bits? Most floating point formats store the implied 1 bit of the manitssa. Not so, the x87 extended-double format. There's a bit that absolutely has to be a 1 bit

[04:15:00] <simcop2387> gordonfish: yea, it'd add a *LOT* of transistors to scale it up so if you're going to pay it anyway, you may as well go 32bit, 64bit, and 128bit
[04:15:49] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: and that's only true for values other than 0

[04:16:37] <LeoNerd> That's what the "subnormal" values are about
[04:16:44] <gordonfish> That makes sense. So why hasn't any chip maker tried to push something like a new 128 fp standard, or maybe larger, to try to push things forward for the future intead of being stuck with legacy fp types and their age old problems

[04:17:58] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ AVX-512 - Wikipedia ]
[04:18:30] <simcop2387> gordonfish: basically the issue is the size of 128bit floats swamps the registers, at least until avx512 where you can fit 4 of them together
[04:18:41] <LeoNerd> Really annoying that Intel calls 16bit a "word", whereas IEEE calls 32bits a "single" float. It means that a "double word" integer is 32bits while a "double precision" float is 64, and the same at quad.

[04:31:26] <aquanight> we should just use BCD-coded decimals

[04:32:01] <aquanight> I believe they were 11 bytes for a 10-digit mantissa and E±99
[04:32:25] <aquanight> god it's been so effing long since I've had anything to do with the TI-83+
[04:32:32] <simcop2387> 11 bytes as long as you needed no more than 255 digits
[04:32:34] <aquanight> I'm pretty sure I have that wrong
[04:33:11] <aquanight> I think it was something like
[04:33:28] <aquanight> 10 digits displayed, and either 12 or 14 stored, and of course the aforementioned exponent
[04:33:35] <aquanight> so 8 or 9 bytes

[15:31:28] <LeoNerd> Much
[15:31:39] <LeoNerd> `require` simply says (at runtime), we want atleast this version of perl
[15:31:50] <LeoNerd> `use VERSION` at compiletime says we need that, and additionally enables lots of new features
[15:32:17] <LeoNerd> If you request any version 5.12 or higher, you'll get  use strict  by default. You'll also enable a feature bundle for that version - those contain lots of new shiney things
[15:32:27] <kjetilho> wow!  TIL
[15:32:34] <LeoNerd> If you request a version 5.34 or higher you'll get `use warnings` as well
[15:33:11] <LeoNerd> The feature bundle for the upcoming v5.36 will include the "signatures" and "isa" features, on top of all the other bits; and finally removes the "indirect" misfeature

[15:33:42] <LeoNerd> So if you write new code with  use v5.36;  you'll get all those good things *and* you'll turn off the "indirect" misfeature, so generally get clearer error messages when you forget to import something
[15:34:11] <LeoNerd> In summary: You really should start *every single perl file* with an appropriate `use VERSION`
[15:34:38] <xcombelle> I'm feel so sorry that perl gave us php
[15:35:45] <kjetilho> LeoNerd: I'll definitely be sure to use v5.12 at the least.  so I save myself use strict, and can rely on //.

[18:14:20] <sokan> Sooo. That was interesting. Prof shared his solution to the programming asignment we had, and used $-[] and $+[] and another with pos(), which he never taught/explained to us before. :P
[18:14:23] * sokan facepalms
[18:15:02] <stanrifkin> when use something like "use parent qw(Exporter); @Exporter::EXPORT qw(my_sub);" in a module - why isn't that working? It works of course with our @EXPORT. What is the full qualified name of @EXPORT and how can I find that out (with the debugger for example)?
[18:16:52] <Botje> what do you hope to accomplish with @Exporter::EXPORT = qw(my_sub) ?
[18:17:02] <Botje> beyond fucking up the export list of Exporter
[18:17:43] <stanrifkin> just curiosity
[18:19:04] <Botje> sure, but what were you hoping to accomplish?
[18:19:34] <Botje> Exporter defines a sub import that looks at package variables like our @Export
[18:19:44] *** Quits: xcombelle (~xavie@176-139-252-198.abo.bbox.fr) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[18:20:36] <stanrifkin> and in general how I figure out the full name of @EXPORTER

[18:21:08] <Botje> that's the bit you're not getting, I think.
[18:21:29] <Botje> every package has its own @EXPORT
[18:21:35] <stanrifkin> ah ok...
[18:22:12] <Botje> the full name would be @Your::Package::Name::@EXPORT
[18:22:13] <stanrifkin> so it addresses in the context for example @main::EXPORT
[18:22:18] <stanrifkin> ok
[18:23:29] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@dz-p5r3b5g750txnzby-4.rev.dnainternet.fi) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:23:48] <Botje> conceptually, `use Module` ends up doing `Module->import`
[18:23:55] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@dz-p5r3b5g750txnzby-4.rev.dnainternet.fi)
[18:24:01] <Botje> and since your package inherits the definition of import from Exporter
[18:24:11] <Botje> it ends up calling Exporter::import("Module")
[18:24:47] <Botje> import looks at the various @EXPORT_* package variables in the module name it receives
[18:25:04] <Botje> and basically copies the symbol table entries into that of its caller
[18:27:36] <sokan> Can someone explain how's ARGV used / what's its purpose?
[18:28:30] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@dz-p5r3b5g750txnzby-4.rev.dnainternet.fi) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[18:28:34] <Botje> it's to receive arguments from the outside.
[18:29:00] <Botje> perl foo.pl arguments go here ==> @ARGV = ("arguments", "go", "here")
[18:29:10] <Botje> or qw(arguments go here), as we like to call it
[18:30:41] <stanrifkin> Botje: thank you. Have got now an working import() example. It seems to manipulate the symbol-table. Have to look more into the Exporter code.
[18:30:50] <ilmari> perlbot: tell socan about perldoc -v @ARGV
[18:30:50] <perlbot> socan: https://perldoc.perl.org/variables/%40ARGV
[18:30:52] <mmlj4> I've only seen this once in 20 years of programming, but it happened again yesterday on a client's PC. I wrote a non-OOP LAMP application, mod_perl and MariaDB with DBI... she was entering items into a form, one line at a time... but then it started doing double and triple inserts. Honestly I have no idea what could cause this. Ideas? Thanks.
[18:31:18] <Botje> mmlj4: that is too vague to even begin to help you.

[18:32:47] <mmlj4> Botje: agreed. I'm going to add logging statements to see if I can track it down on my side, but I'm also considering whether the browser could be sending things more than once

[18:33:14] <sokan> ilmari: I see. I don't again understand much. Is there an example possible? :/ I search for "perl ARGV example" but don't get much. 
[18:33:17] <Botje> no, computers tend to do what they're told. no more, no less.
[18:33:35] <Botje> sokan: see my example above
[18:33:56] <sokan> Botje: I missed your answer. Sorry

[18:34:31] <Botje> mmlj4: for starters, is it a plain HTML form or is a bit of JS involved?
[18:34:53] <Botje> mmlj4: do your HTTP access logs show evidence of double or triple requests?
[18:34:55] <sokan> Botje, ilmari thank you both :)
[18:35:09] <Botje> mmlj4: is it possible your client just clicked the submit button twice in a row?
[18:35:55] <Botje> mmlj4: which would be trivial to check for yourself of course, just hammer that button :D
[18:36:07] <mmlj4> there's a tiny bit of JS in the app, but not for this form at all

[18:37:51] <mmlj4> but when the form submit validates on the server (I don't do any client-side validation at all), the INSERT is done and the form is not displayed again, only the results (which is a list of all entered items, old and the new one just added)
[18:38:25] <mmlj4> yeah, I'm going to go in after hours, sit at her machine and try to repeat the problem
[18:38:38] <Botje> so hammering the submit problem should trivially result in duplicate entries
[18:38:49] <mmlj4> should
[18:38:59] <mmlj4> after I set up logging overkill :-)
[18:39:01] <Botje> one click, one request
[18:39:13] <Botje> that's why you disable the button on submit
[18:39:15] <ilmari> add some javascript that disables the submit button when it's clicked
[18:39:52] <mmlj4> I'm not following... disable the button?
[18:40:02] <Botje> yes.
[18:40:15] <Botje> to prevent further clicks from triggering new requests
[18:40:21] <mmlj4> oh, gotcha
[18:41:17] <mmlj4> she might be double-clicking, but that still sounds weird

[20:53:03] <LeoNerd> That's because the DOS shell doesn't do globbing; each individual invoked program must do it individually by inspecting the commandline arguments
