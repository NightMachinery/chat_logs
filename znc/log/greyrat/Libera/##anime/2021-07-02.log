[00:23:40] <ButterNoodle> *not my fault ur coding
[00:23:59] <mexen> 15 minutes actually, I already know which extensions I want
[00:24:00] <KatrinValerie> And get spacemacs instead
[00:24:01] <Bco1981> i don't really get the appeal of tacos, those hard shells that completely breaks if you take a bite of it. or are tacos not those hard shells anywhere else in the world ?
[00:24:13] <mexen> Now my vimrc on the other hand
[00:25:16] <mexen> KatrinValerie: maybe some day, I always look at emacs and think, "I am going to like this aren't I? But I am also going to spend a long time with tweaking it just so, aren't I?"
[00:25:58] <MootPoot> cum
[00:26:17] <shinythings> tacos are with regular soft tortillas
[00:26:37] <KatrinValerie> mexen: spacemacs welcomes former vim users, as it's an emacs distribution centered around evil mode
[00:26:46] <KatrinValerie> which gives emacs vim like features
[00:26:51] <KatrinValerie> Why you ask?
[00:26:54] <KatrinValerie> Because we can
[00:27:02] <KatrinValerie> And you can still hack all the features of emacs
[00:27:17] <mexen> Oh, that's pretty neat.
[00:27:19] <KatrinValerie> but yeah, it's a lot of work to get into it and I never fully did it.

[00:28:35] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: I read the MS newsletter and was like, wtf
[00:28:49] <KatrinValerie> It sounds like they are degrading it to an entertainment system
[00:28:53] <jessedesu_onaph> Fuck, now I wanna drop 3 grand on a guitar
[00:28:54] <mexen> if you use PaaS and stuff, your OS almost becomes immaterial
[00:28:57] <KatrinValerie> not that windows ever was usable for development
[00:29:19] <MootPoot> Its amusing how many linux people are keeping upto date with windows stuff for some reason

[00:30:40] <MootPoot> the majority market
[00:30:46] <MootPoot> what is this elitism
[00:31:19] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: bigger coprs like IBM are already offering GNU/Linux as a choice for your operating system
[00:31:27] <KatrinValerie> they also offer macbooks
[00:31:52] <MootPoot> ah yes, everyone just has to get a job at IBM 
[00:32:07] <MootPoot> nvm, this is a pointless argument really
[00:32:14] <KatrinValerie> No, but maybe some of the industry will follow

[02:31:39] <ButterNoodle> honestly think the seals are dirty
[02:31:47] <ButterNoodle> tires arent a problem

[02:32:02] <ButterNoodle> may go w some soft compound since I dont commute on it
[02:32:06] <ButterNoodle> naaa
[02:32:13] <ButterNoodle> if u go japanese there is no worry..
[02:32:24] <ButterNoodle> its these damn euro bikes
[02:32:37] <MootPoot> all I'm considering are jap bikes atm tbh
[02:32:49] <ButterNoodle> I would...
[02:32:58] <ButterNoodle> parts and service are plentiful
[02:33:13] <MootPoot> maybe a bmw
[02:33:19] <MootPoot> or ktm
[02:33:38] <ButterNoodle> yea those are euro
[02:33:43] <ButterNoodle> parts and service sucks
[02:34:41] <MootPoot> but yeah, I just have eyes for the versys-x, kawi/honda 650-700cc ADV bikes and/or a used DS
[02:34:56] <ButterNoodle> good picks.. all great service intervals
[02:35:01] <ButterNoodle> and plentiful parts
[02:35:18] <ButterNoodle> bbl, going fer a hike
[02:35:29] <MootPoot> I might by sol and have to get a 300cc used road bike but I personally only really want ADVs , DS bikes or maybe a scooter for the luls
[02:35:31] <MootPoot> gotcha

[03:05:37] <Nanobot> I just did one of my least favorite things.
[03:05:43] <Nanobot> I replaced the gas lift in my chair.
[03:06:31] *** Quits: shinythings (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:07:48] <Nanobot> I even bought one of those tools specifically designed to separate the gas lift from the chair, which worked okay. The real problem was separating the gas lift from the base. All those guides that say to use a rubber mallet can go jump off a cliff. The rubber mallet was absolutely useless. It wasn't until I started smacking it directly with a metal hammer that it finally came off.
[03:08:18] <Nanobot> So, I'm going to have problems with my back and hands for a while now.
[03:08:50] <jessedesu2> What a gas
[03:09:44] <MootPoot> Nanobot: ?
[03:09:47] <MootPoot> you can do that?
[03:10:09] <MootPoot> you need to replace gas pistons in chairs?
[03:10:19] <MootPoot> what, did you have a herman miller or something?
[03:10:52] <Nanobot> The gas lift is usually the first thing to go bad for me. The second is usually the arm wrests.
[03:10:56] <Nanobot> *rests
[03:12:33] <Nanobot> This is the chair I have: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797HZ8W1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
[03:12:45] <ImoutoBot> [error] Malformed Response
[03:13:32] <Nanobot> However, I've bought it twice, and the back of the chair was different. The second time, the mesh was loose and didn't provide enough support, so most of my weight was actually on the lumbar support, which caused major problems for my lumbar.
[03:13:50] <Nanobot> I ended up removing the back of the first chair and putting it on the second.
[03:15:17] <jessedesu2> Nanobot if we crowd funded you, could you possibly bring back imoutobot !g functionality
[03:15:41] <Nanobot> I'll bring it back after I retire.
[03:15:44] <MootPoot> Nanobot:  lol thats basically my chair
[03:15:45] <MootPoot> lol
[03:15:51] <jessedesu2> I mean, how much is it
[03:15:58] <MootPoot> I have a staples hyken I got for 50% off
[03:16:00] <MootPoot> 100 bucks
[03:16:24] <MootPoot> Nanobot:  I've found that arm rests encouragle slouching and puts pressure on my elbow nerves
[03:16:35] <MootPoot> so I've started to take them off intentionally
[03:17:51] <Nanobot> I need about a million dollars after taxes to feel safe about retiring.
[03:18:58] <MootPoot> you have some spinal issues right Nanobot ?
[03:19:08] <MootPoot> do those fancy expensive ergo chairs work for you?
[03:19:11] <Nanobot> Yeah. I need to keep weight off my spine.
[03:19:28] <MootPoot> so you cant sit up perfectly straight then right?
[03:19:38] <Nanobot> Price seems to have little to do with whether a chair is good for my back. It's more a matter of the specific curves and angles.
[03:19:49] <MootPoot> what about those slightly leaning chairs there the monitors are mounted above you
[03:19:53] <MootPoot> and you recline a bit
[03:21:45] <Nanobot> I have no idea whether a specific chair will be good for me until I try that specific chair for a few weeks. Take my current chair for example. It's the best chair I've ever owned, my for back. But when I bought another of the exact same model, it caused major pain after just a week or so and took months to recover from.
[03:22:05] <Nanobot> The only difference was a bit of resistance in the mesh back.
[03:22:47] <MootPoot> can you get a physio company or something to make one just for you?
[03:23:10] <MootPoot> I heard its expensive but psysiotherapists sometimes can do that or help at least
[03:23:11] <Nanobot> I doubt it would be better than what I currently have.
[03:23:19] <MootPoot> huh
[03:23:48] <MootPoot> I'm just entering the job market  for IT/programming/desk work so I've been very particular about my ergo lately
[03:26:25] <Nanobot> My situation seems to be unusual. I once had a cortisone injection that the doctor said would 100% relieve my pain for at least 6 months. It actually gave me about 80% relief for just a few weeks. The doctor was in disbelief and tried again with a much higher dose. Same result.

[03:30:52] <Nanobot> I had surgery to fix the most severe symptoms, so I no longer walk with a limp with pain in every step, and I can move my right leg forward now. But the root issue is still the same. It sounds like my spine basically loves to stab all the fleshy material around it, so I need to avoid moving too much and keep pressure off the discs as much as possible. But, if I don't exercise at all, that puts even more pressure on the discs.
[03:32:06] <MootPoot> they cant like, laser off the sharp parts
[03:33:04] <MootPoot> like they do with foot bone spurs
[03:33:05] <Nanobot> The surgeon said that if I want to pursue any further surgical treatments, the next step would be fusion. Basically, nailing metal bars into my spine so my spine won't move anymore.
[03:33:15] <MootPoot> oof
[03:33:26] <MootPoot> I've heard of those, you cant really bend over anymore
[03:33:28] <MootPoot> for a year at least
[03:33:43] <Nanobot> Ever. The whole idea is to prevent the spine from bending.
[03:33:54] <Nanobot> It's a permanent "solution"
[03:34:22] <MootPoot> how did it all start?
[03:34:28] <MootPoot> car accident?
[03:34:30] <Nanobot> (and, of course, it can also cause other issues, including more strain on the spine in the parts that *aren't* nailed to a metal bar)
[03:35:07] <Nanobot> Nothing really caused it. It just developed over time. I started noticing it toward the end of high school, and my first year of college was when I started having major issues.
[03:37:39] <MootPoot> huh
[03:37:44] <MootPoot> damn

[07:29:58] <mathu> amigojapan: yeah a few US states are finding that the most efficient way to use their COVID relief money is to offer lotteries rather than more marketing
[07:30:35] <amigojapan> Sadale: I am getting vaccinated but no lottery here
[07:30:47] <mathu> they got to a point where there was more availability than demand, and it's not like anybody didn't know about COVID, so they created an incentive for people to go 
[07:31:14] <amigojapan> I see mathu 
[07:31:49] <amigojapan> mathu: it's sad that money is ultimately got the people to do it and not empathy
[07:31:56] <mathu> i think i'd like to have seen more stimulus payments + some kind of executive action that businesses must give employees, like, 5 days off within a span of 2 months to get their first and second dose without getting fired
[07:33:06] <amigojapan> mathu: I get my first dose in the 14th
[07:33:25] *** Joins: Koobrick (~Koobrick@207.181.232.209)
[07:33:28] <amigojapan> And my second dose on the 4 of August
[07:33:46] <mathu> amigojapan: i've heard different reasons for not wanting to get vaccinated, i think the bulk of them are silly but there are people who feel they can't miss work for the side effects, or who are more afraid of side effects than of continuing to quarantine so they want to wait
[07:33:54] <mathu> amigojapan: congrats!
[07:34:02] <mathu> glad it's finally happening for you!
[07:34:28] <mathu> well, "finally" - slower than USA but i think there are countries that are gonna be doing substantial vacc rollout into 2022 and beyond probably
[07:34:48] <amigojapan> Yeah mathu I was waiting for the first opportunity
[07:35:26] <mathu> second dose symptoms vary wildly between people. for me, i had a super high fever, severe chills, and restlessness the night after i got it, but those symptoms were fully gone by like 10am
[07:35:52] <amigojapan> I see
[07:35:53] <mathu> no nausea whatsoever, i could eat whatever i wanted
[07:36:13] <Sadale> amigojapan, lol you Japanese aren't clever enough. We Hongkies are clever and we're super reluctant to get the shots. That's why them merchants are kind of forced to offer incentives for the people to get vaccinated :P
[07:36:19] <mathu> whereas other people are nauseous for like 2 days
[07:37:12] <mathu> Sadale: is hongkies a common way to refer to HKers in english? i don't know a lot of HKers but i usually hear HKer
[07:37:27] <mathu> Sadale: (just wondering, not trying to correct you or anything haha)
[07:37:30] <Sadale> mathu, it isn't common to say hongkies.
[07:37:35] <mathu> it's kind of cute haha
[07:38:00] <Sadale> Nevertheless HK is a part of China. Just to make it clear. :3
[07:38:18] <amigojapan> mathu: I hope I can get Pfizer
[07:39:01] <mathu> Sadale: most HK news i see is of the opposite slant haha
[07:39:48] <mathu> most of the time when i hear about HK news it's when pro-democracy activists or journalists are arrested or shut down
[07:39:54] <Sadale> mathu, true haha. In fact most younger people doesn't like this idea either. I'm really an exception on the younger people because I barely interact with people in real life. So I do have my own school of thoughts.
[07:40:17] <Sadale> So more discretion, less peer pressure to me.,

[07:51:11] <MootPoot> While amigo is correct from a abstract pov, in function there are lots of uses for collective belief or collective concepts 
[07:51:27] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan u do realize you are in one of the words largest group think collectives
[07:51:40] <MootPoot> Like for example the economy, The idea of open source , the internet
[07:51:46] <mathu> amigojapan: i get that they're social constructs in a sense. but like, i need a driver's license, some folks need unemployment benefits, some folks need to file lawsuits. do you think there should be a way to do those things that isn't a country government? or do you just mean people are too nationalistic

[11:12:27] <death916> they wouldnt treat the syphiliss even after testing

[11:16:08] <mathu> i really don't think the covid vacc is the same thing and imo you should get vaccinated but like, i can't pretend healthcare has been or currently is equitable and ethical
[11:16:34] <death916> i smoke weed so im pretty sure im immune to the rona
[11:16:39] <death916> my lungs r too coated for it to get in
[11:17:24] <mathu> i don't think smoking anything is a great defense against a respiratory virus :v

[11:19:39] <death916> well im going to vegas in 2 weeks

[11:20:42] <death916> isnt that the one that makes ur heart explode
[11:21:06] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[11:21:17] <Poeticode> yeah i got j&j and i died
[11:21:21] <death916> ur old tho
[11:21:25] <mathu> there's a vanishingly small clot risk and the pause in distribution was to communicate to doctors that there's an unusual treatment you're supposed to use for it
[11:21:31] <death916> it kills young people with exploding heart attacks
[11:21:40] <mathu> i think J&J is less effective than the others tho
[11:21:42] <death916> no theres 100s of cases of myocarditis

[11:23:07] <death916> clots r bad
[11:23:20] <death916> although my watch makes me get up once every 45 mins
[11:23:27] <mathu> sitting increases your risk of clots, i don't think it makes clots worse if they develop
[11:23:46] <Poeticode> why don't articles have a tl;dr besides the clickbait title?
[11:23:51] <death916> lol its forbes
[11:23:54] <Poeticode> or maybe just a list of sources up top
[11:23:55] <death916> i lazily googled
[11:24:06] <death916> i normally wouldnt link forbes
[11:24:18] <Poeticode> why u linking unread articles?

[11:24:34] <JesseDesu> poeticode
[11:24:36] <death916> fda.gov posted it
[11:24:37] <mathu> the risk is miniscule, hundreds of cases out of tens of millions of doses administered is probably comparable risk to like, the shit printed on the side of a motrin bottle
[11:24:43] <death916> and news outtlets wrote about it
[11:24:52] <death916> i dont take motrin either

[11:25:21] <JesseDesu> charge your keyboard with your sperm bank
[11:25:31] <mathu> death916: i don't think motrin is special vs any ibuprofen really, and acetaminophen is higher risk i think
[11:25:41] <death916> i dont take any of those cuz i used to drink alot
[11:25:47] <death916> so im tryna not kill my liver anymore

[11:30:48] <death916> as i said b4 no coverage
[11:30:55] <death916> till insurance kicks back over
[11:31:01] <mathu> since being a smoker was a category that made you eligible for vacc earlier than everyone else i figure by default that it's safe
[11:31:11] <mathu> or, that covid risk is higher than vacc risk
[11:31:15] <death916> makes sens

[11:35:57] <death916> well cept e a few times
[11:35:58] <mathu> when google told me they don't cause liver damage i figured you just had a chronic condition or whatever

[11:36:18] <death916> tryna recover
[11:36:18] <death916> lol
[11:36:25] <death916> kinda wild not too too
[11:36:42] <mathu> i tried to google covid rates in vegas but i realized since people go to vegas and would go home before developing covid it's probably really hard to figure out how risky it actually is
[11:37:18] <mathu> i don't want to soapbox but i hope you do wear masks / keep distance bc it's probably too late to do the J&J plan realistically
[11:37:40] <death916> is jnj 2 dose?
[11:37:44] <death916> could get 1 at least
[11:37:45] <death916> lol
[11:37:47] <mathu> jnj is just the one dose
[11:37:47] <prpldmn`> no

[11:37:54] <death916> i get tham all mixe dup
[11:37:54] <death916> lol
[11:38:13] <mathu> one dose + 2 week waiting period == immunized. the downside is it's only like 80% effective vs 95% from the others, or something like that
[11:38:20] <mathu> if you want the real numbers google for them
[11:38:32] <prpldmn`> or go tu cuba, theres a new vaccine there
[11:38:32] <Poeticode> on the bright side, more old people will die if cases go up again
[11:38:52] <Poeticode> they're bad for capitalism
[11:39:01] <mathu> prpldmn`: yeah i heard the cuba one was performing well, i don't really think of cuba as a big pharmaceuticals producer so that was neat haha
[11:40:02] <prpldmn`> lets see what vaccine i get
[11:40:12] <death916> i think imm immune
[11:40:17] <death916> i waas riding public transit
[11:40:20] <death916> when the big wave hit
[11:40:23] <death916> never got it
[11:40:29] <death916> then i got a car shortly after
[11:41:07] <mathu> also the side effects are real, some people manage to fully avoid them but some people are legitimately out of commission for a couple days. idk if your job gives you time off or sick days but be aware if you do get vacc
[11:41:24] <mathu> death916: i think they're still recommending you get vacc even if you fully had covid
[11:42:04] <mathu> i haven't actually read why, it might be that having covid leaves you vulnerable to variants but vaccines have been working across variants?
[11:42:09] <mathu> but that's a guess
[11:42:39] <amigojapan> mathu: which brand vaccine did you get?
[11:42:42] <mathu> i got moderna
[11:42:48] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[11:43:04] <amigojapan> Is moderna also RNA?
[11:43:22] <mathu> mRNA, yeah

[11:44:02] <death916> so tomorrow would b 13 days
[11:44:10] <death916> err today
[11:44:37] <amigojapan> death916: since you took your second dose?
[11:45:04] <mathu> the 14 day thing is probably probabilistic, 12 or 13 days is probably basically as good?
[11:45:30] <mathu> mmm i don't actually feel right making that guess
[11:45:36] <amigojapan> 14 days for what?
[11:45:43] <mathu> don't know enough about how vacc works to guess things like that
[11:45:57] <death916> im going out of town amigojapan and they r trying to see if id b vaxxed by the time i got there
[11:46:22] <amigojapan> I see death916 
[11:46:31] <mathu> yeah, since the J&J vaccine is one dose, if he gets the shot tomorrow he'd be very close to the 2w waiting period
[11:46:51] <death916> which idk if ill even bother trying 
[11:47:03] <mathu> i don't like writing so much to argue with your personal healthcare decision lol, sorry for soapboxing so much
