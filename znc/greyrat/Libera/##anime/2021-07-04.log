[00:05:38] <TsundereNoises> seriously though, idols have been graduating when they retire forever, it's weird people are suddenly making a thing out of it in this case
[00:06:12] <HubertFarnsworth> Btw TsundereNoises, I recently learned in ##anime that getting into vtuber business isn’t costly.
[00:06:37] <TsundereNoises> yeah I guess you can use your phone camera or something, but you'd have to get a model 
[00:07:01] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean to make a vtuber from animation, art, production..
[00:07:42] <HubertFarnsworth> But why are they retiring popular idols? This doesn’t make sense.
[00:07:59] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: it was her choice
[00:08:22] <HubertFarnsworth> Can’t they replace her with other voice actress?
[00:08:24] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: she's like one of the single most superchatted people on youtube
[00:08:33] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: no, absolutely not
[00:08:40] <HubertFarnsworth> Why not?
[00:09:09] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: a) that'd be disgusting and piss everyone off b) Coco is vey much tied to her personality, all of Hololive is but she's really extremely distinct and blurs the line with the real person
[00:09:34] <TsundereNoises> and c) that was so much of the downfall of Kizuna Ai, it has even more negatives because of that
[00:09:38] <TsundereNoises> but it could never work
[00:10:01] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: Kson IS Coco, the line between character and actress is very thin
[00:10:05] <HubertFarnsworth> Are the voices that discerning? Hmm

[00:14:59] <HubertFarnsworth> Working as a vtuber, I don’t know what creeps might be spying on her.
[00:15:00] <TsundereNoises> at most a contract might limit your ability to compete in the same industry

[00:21:49] <TsundereNoises> I mean, short term like that actually is common in the US too for like tv and stuff, but it's just a financial penalty
[00:22:00] <HubertFarnsworth> Depends on contract TsundereNoises, most of them have payout or stuff like that
[00:22:12] <HubertFarnsworth> Same
[00:22:15] <TsundereNoises> and in that case, contracts wouldn't matter, if you just renegotiate the contract every year or two, you would still have people retiring

[01:22:08] <spoonm> again, I'm not saying they are any more replaceable than your standard face-on-camera YouTube personality
[01:22:24] <TsundereNoises> and the audience has a connection to the character that relates to the person playing them as well as the character themselves, in a way that isn't nearly as true with a tv show or movie franchise or whatever
[01:22:26] <spoonm> Vohveli's claim was that they're not playing a role, which is what I disagree with: they're playing a role
[01:22:45] <spoonm> to conflate role playing with replaceability is wrong, in my opinion
[01:23:13] <TsundereNoises> spoonm: sure, but in a lot of cases that role is like talking with a slightly different accent and playing up some catchphrase or something
[01:23:19] <TsundereNoises> not like a totally different person
[01:23:28] <spoonm> yes, but it's still a role, is it not?
[01:23:51] <TsundereNoises> yes but at some point I think this may be a failing of the word "role" being too broad
[01:24:26] <TsundereNoises> there's a difference between that, and what's his name playing Iron Man
[01:24:57] <spoonm> Vohveli could've easily said they're just not replaceable as there's more attachment to personality traits and mannerisms transcending character features, a replacement for which would not be easily overlooked like it can be in instances where multiple characters appears over the course of the narrative
[01:25:07] <HubertFarnsworth> Let’s call him iron man guy.
[01:25:36] <TsundereNoises> spoonm: but I think you're missing something here
[01:26:00] <spoonm> I don't think so, I'm perhaps missing "nuance" and "what he meant to say", in a way being asked to ignore "what he actually said"
[01:26:03] <TsundereNoises> spoonm: it's not just personality traits and mannerisms and it's not just about replacibility, Voh has a point
[01:26:11] <HubertFarnsworth> spoonm: I though all their voices are processed digitally so it might be possible to replace and not know the difference
[01:26:11] <TsundereNoises> even if there IS an element of roleplaying here
[01:26:17] <Vohveli> they're not replaceable because people are attached to the person behind the avatar
[01:26:27] <spoonm> there we go
[01:26:38] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: that's not true
[01:26:39] * spoonm attaches himself to Vohveli
[01:26:45] <HubertFarnsworth> I see
[01:27:37] <HubertFarnsworth> But wait, how can they be attached to person behind avatar? Aren’t their plays and acts scripted?
[01:27:53] <Vohveli> if you get reductive enough, I suppose we all play a slightly different "role" to different people
[01:27:53] <HubertFarnsworth> They do their own stuff?
[01:27:55] <TsundereNoises> spoonm: honestly I don't really care about what Voh said, i'm more arguing about where the line is between actor, professional wrestler, and vtuber
[01:27:59] <Vohveli> but that's not what I meant by "role"
[01:28:11] <davic> Vohveli: hur mår du mannen
[01:28:41] <Vohveli> davic: jag kopplar av
[01:28:46] <Vohveli> or something
[01:28:47] <davic> Najs najs
[01:28:56] <Vohveli> and now I'm off to play TPP
[01:28:56] <TsundereNoises> also I refuse to believe NoeFure isn't real
[01:29:04] <spoonm> I'm aware, Vohveli, but I think I care more about semantics than your average Joe, even if I don't go down too much
[01:29:16] * TsundereNoises also cares more about semantics

[02:02:03] <KatrinValerie> oh boy, why does something like blackface have to remind me of the death of a dutch friend...
[02:02:25] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie: because the dutch have this weird history with it starting in the 1800s?
[02:02:26] <KatrinValerie> they had that festival when I visited, that's why

[02:10:45] <KatrinValerie> Well, it's not like this came out of nowhere either, research already classified the corona genus as a potential candidate for a pandemic
[02:10:55] <duds> Aurora_v_kosmose, I know? But most Japanese people won’t turn down working with a Korean for their race lol. They’re not all racist even if the bureaucracy blows up the issue.
[02:11:02] <TsundereNoises> hello mikau
[02:11:29] <HubertFarnsworth> I didn’t know my first Korean manwha is manwha until I finished it. The names were weird but it didn’t bother me much theholyduck
[02:11:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> duds: Possibly true, but they aren't disadvantaged legally in a number of ways.
[02:11:51] <HubertFarnsworth> TsundereNoises: really? What books?
[02:12:16] <mikau> TsundereNoises: hey there!
[02:12:19] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie, theholyduck: yeah people really want to believe in the "things happen for a reason" idea, and will stretch a lot to accomodate it
[02:12:28] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: funny thing is, we might get pandemics more frequent now than in the past.
[02:12:44] <KatrinValerie> There's the potential of historic pathogens being released from tawing permafrost
[02:12:50] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie:  i mean. for some definition of the past 
[02:12:59] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie:  plague used to just be normal
[02:13:14] <theholyduck> people died all the time to various diseases sweeping through the country
[02:13:17] <theholyduck> it was sort of normal
[02:13:19] <KatrinValerie> Yeah they have certain cycles though
[02:13:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Technically things do always happen for a reason. People just don't like that the reason can be pretty meaningless sometimes.
[02:13:41] <HubertFarnsworth> Wait, there are pathogens in permafrost?
[02:13:47] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth: potentially 
[02:14:09] <HubertFarnsworth> That means probably right?
[02:14:12] <mikau> HubertFarnsworth: that's what Sweet Tooth is about.
[02:14:17] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I mean The Windup Girl by Paulo Bacigalupi and River of Gods / Cyberabad Days by Ian McDonald were the ones I was thinking of
[02:14:22] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: those are all great
[02:14:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some extremophiles can survive in such environments.
[02:14:38] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: and all deal with climate change somewhat I think
[02:14:44] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: also a lot of short stories in that vein
[02:15:19] <TsundereNoises> extremeophiles don't cause disease
[02:15:22] <TsundereNoises> basically by definition
[02:15:35] <HubertFarnsworth> I see TsundereNoises. I have started dune again besides I have Wodehouse. I’m prisoner of Wodehouse for life.
[02:15:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TsundereNoises: Yes, that's one of the things that makes me wonder what we're expecting.
[02:15:48] <TsundereNoises> if there's a dangerous pathogen in ice it's just something that has some kind of cold-durable cyst form that can survive for a long time
[02:15:56] <TsundereNoises> rather than something that actually flourishes in the cold
[02:16:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TsundereNoises: Viruses? Because I'd think any frozen bacterial cells would be too degraded to be viable.
[02:16:13] <TsundereNoises> anyway, we'll always have pandemics, and we may have more soon
[02:16:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or right, bacterial spore-like stuff...
[02:16:33] <TsundereNoises> but an increase in pandemics is much more linked to population density, or chicken population density, than it is to global warming
[02:16:41] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: at the very least there will be types anthrax there
[02:16:45] <KatrinValerie> in the tundra
[02:16:49] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: think of bacteria like Anthrax though
[02:17:00] <TsundereNoises> or botulism
[02:17:02] <TsundereNoises> tetnus
[02:17:03] <volki57> At this point I am just waiting for the Black Death 2.0 update
[02:17:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TsundereNoises: Hm... I wonder if the current vaccines for that one would be good-enough.
[02:17:07] <TsundereNoises> lots of bacteria can survive
[02:17:10] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: i mean. we now also have MRNA vaccination tech and the ability to mass produce vaccines. 
[02:17:14] <TsundereNoises> the question is if anything is both deadly and contagious enough
[02:17:18] <HubertFarnsworth> The thing I learned in the NYT article is most species have their own cycle unless we intervene in theirs, it won’t be harmful. The bacteria and viruses that are depended on humans for spreading won’t be quite deadly.
[02:17:19] <TsundereNoises> overall I'm not really very worried about it
[02:17:29] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: the covid pzifer vaccine was ready in like march
[02:17:30] <TsundereNoises> there are a lot bigger and more likely threats
[02:17:32] <theholyduck> of 2020
[02:17:43] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  all the delays were over testing
[02:18:09] *** Quits: evolv (~evolv@user/evolv) (Quit: I'M LEAVING! ... AH!)
[02:18:11] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: then you're badly misunderstanding something
[02:18:12] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  if we asume the mRNA thing is generally safe. theres no reason we cant synthesize a mrna vaccine for any given virus that pops up
[02:18:22] <theholyduck> and mass produce enough units of vaccine to shut down a spread
[02:18:26] <TsundereNoises> we will always have pandemics, and that doesn't require some kind of "meddling where man was not meant to meddle" logic
[02:18:30] <TsundereNoises> we always have
[02:18:36] <KatrinValerie> I think it might have made a difference to wave the patents on the vaccines
[02:18:37] <HubertFarnsworth> Ohh
[02:18:40] <TsundereNoises> and we make them worse with our current refusal to be organized about stuff
[02:18:59] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: there ARE diseases that you don't have to worry about for those reasons, but that's not really what anyone ever worries about anyway
[02:19:01] <KatrinValerie> and tbh, end this stupid practise already
[02:19:28] <KatrinValerie> most of the development of these vaccine technologies is from publicly funded research anyways
[02:19:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Patents in general need to end.
[02:19:36] <TsundereNoises> I mean, mrna vaccines are a good advance but we've been putting them off and they won't solve everything
[02:19:39] <TsundereNoises> but yes, they are a plus
[02:19:47] <TsundereNoises> yes
[02:19:52] <TsundereNoises> fuck patent law
[02:19:55] <KatrinValerie> Aurora_v_kosmose: they will only end along with capitalism
[02:20:05] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  my point was that creating a brand new mrna vaccine can literally be done in a matter of weeks if you can sequence the virus fast enough
[02:20:14] <theholyduck> and with enough production capacity for vaccines
[02:20:46] <mikau> fuck patent law indeed
[02:20:52] <theholyduck> asuming the tech is asumed to be safe enough to not need extensive human testing
[02:21:04] <KatrinValerie> Who would try and make medicine based on basic scientific research in this system, when they cannot make crazy money on it?
[02:21:11] <HubertFarnsworth> How deep in permafrost are these viruses?
[02:21:24] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: for viruses for which it's effective, it won't help with HIV for example (I'm pretty sure)
[02:21:46] <TsundereNoises> then the problem is vaccine distribution
[02:21:49] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: as far as im aware there is a HIV vacine in testing
[02:21:52] <theholyduck> thats mRNA based
[02:22:03] <KatrinValerie> Wasn't the mRNA research specific to the corona virus genus?
[02:22:08] <theholyduck> no
[02:22:14] <theholyduck> quite the opposite
[02:22:17] <TsundereNoises> no the concept was around for a while and needed funding
[02:22:21] <theholyduck> most mRNA research is focused on fighting cancer
[02:22:22] <theholyduck> i think
[02:22:26] <TsundereNoises> and yeah, the idea is you could pick any random strand of RNA
[02:22:42] <theholyduck> any strand of anything i think really 
[02:22:46] <TsundereNoises> I mean, if you want to go that general, most mRNA research is focussed on understanding how cells function
[02:22:49] <HubertFarnsworth> And they developed a vaccine for lukemia btw
[02:22:53] <theholyduck> the mRNA part is just how you "program" the imune system
[02:23:26] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie: so basicly mRNA was developed to fight cancers by being able to program a specific part of the cancer cell for the imune system to target
[02:23:29] <theholyduck> as i understand it
[02:23:31] <jessedesu_onaph> Who has a degree in microbiology
[02:23:32] <Poeticode> on the bright side, we're funding hundreds of billions of USD into research on how to better kill people
[02:23:38] <TsundereNoises> mRNA is literally just one of the intermediates in the process of genetic information -> protein, it can be anything
[02:23:56] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie:  change a specific part of the cancer cell for specific part of coronavirus
[02:24:04] <TsundereNoises> jessedesu_onaph: me
[02:24:08] <theholyduck> and instant vaccine
[02:24:08] <KatrinValerie> I meant the research on mRNA vaccines
[02:24:42] <HubertFarnsworth> But we have Internet oni chan
[02:24:50] <KatrinValerie> I should go to bed the sun will wake me up at 6am again and I have not had enough sleep in a while
[02:24:50] <TsundereNoises> anyway, we also should be funding things like new antibiotics and should be building up public health infastructure
[02:24:56] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie:  google say the first mrna vaccine trials started in 93. 
[02:25:03] <TsundereNoises> and it's absolutely idiotic to keep all vaccine production private sector
[02:25:04] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie: but yeah i think covid is the first time it was really practical
[02:25:10] <TsundereNoises> but we're going to do it that way because MURICA
[02:25:33] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: yeah, it should have been something getting a lot more funding than it did really
[02:25:55] <HubertFarnsworth> The issue is it needs a lot of funding TsundereNoises which is why some diseases are still not curable
[02:26:06] <KatrinValerie> Remember when bird flu, big flu etc?
[02:26:10] <HubertFarnsworth> Like fatal familial insomnia
[02:26:14] <TsundereNoises> well and some diseases are much more complicated
[02:26:25] <TsundereNoises> yeah we get a big flu every few years
[02:26:37] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: oh gawd that one sounds like a horrible way to go, I have read about it.
[02:26:42] <TsundereNoises> I mean the ones I'd like more focus on are MRSA and lyme disease
[02:26:50] <TsundereNoises> but I have regional reasons for caring about lyme
[02:26:53] <TsundereNoises> still it's a big deal
[02:27:08] <HubertFarnsworth> And also Pharma companies would only want to invest in research where they can make profits.
[02:27:08] <theholyduck> from wikipedia "The benefit of using mRNA to have host cells produce the antigen is that mRNA is far easier for vaccine creators to produce than antigen proteins or attenuated virus.[42][1][4] Another benefit is speed of design and production. Moderna designed their mRNA-1273 vaccine for COVID-19 in 2 days.[44] "
[02:27:16] <theholyduck> if we eventually accept the underlying tech as safe for humans
[02:27:20] <davic> theholyduck: stop spreading false information
[02:27:26] <theholyduck> we could have absurdly fast turnarounds for when new viruses pop up
[02:27:36] <davic> mRNA is a Bill Gates tech
[02:27:43] <davic> All meant to turn us into lizards
[02:27:45] <theholyduck> like we might have been able to pop covid in its infancy
[02:27:47] <HubertFarnsworth> KatrinValerie: it is as horrible as it sounds, read the book, the family that couldn’t sleep.
[02:27:49] <theholyduck> before it became a pandemic
[02:28:02] <HubertFarnsworth> Perfect horror medical story!
[02:28:09] <theholyduck> if it ebcame the norm to synthesize vaccines for novel viruses that pop up in places
[02:28:09] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: I'd suspect we cannot rule out adverse reactions for new vaccines
[02:28:21] <denza242> davic: did u get the pfizer
[02:28:22] <TsundereNoises> davic: yes, and my running mate ButterNoodle and I pledge to turn this technology to a better cause: turning everyone into catgirls
[02:28:22] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: over looking a side effect in programming is a common error

[02:28:29] <denza242> davic: did you get the latest update
[02:28:32] <KatrinValerie> When I look at it from a programmer perspective

[02:28:39] <denza242> how many msft shares did you buy
[02:28:43] <KatrinValerie> You are reversing a system and it's mostly a blackbox
[02:28:51] <davic> denza242: 94101, I sold all my stuff

[02:29:29] <TsundereNoises> or how nonsensical it is

[02:30:18] <Nanobot> Karma for putting chikubi on Kanata's huge boobs.
[02:30:24] <KatrinValerie> That's just external attribution

[02:30:39] <davic> TsundereNoises: of course not, autism is nice to blame on when you are just lazy
[02:30:45] <KatrinValerie> Autistic people can be very happy no matter where they are on the spectrum
[02:30:46] <davic> But autism is fucking hell tbh
[02:30:57] <KatrinValerie> in the right conditions
[02:31:08] <HubertFarnsworth> What’s it like for you davic, if you don’t mind
[02:31:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most functional/spergs probably prefer to continue existing.
[02:31:19] <KatrinValerie> davic: it is only society that makes it a problem really
[02:31:22] <davic> But people believe that every kid that has autism is in the 1%, where they get severe one
[02:31:30] <KatrinValerie> Why does everything have to be so god damned noisy?
[02:31:42] *** Joins: TheAceOfHearts (~TheAceOfH@24.41.239.76)
[02:31:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> One would need quite a lot of trouble for the risk of non-existence to be worth it.
[02:31:45] <KatrinValerie> Why are there no places in public spaces were you can just withdraw for a bit?
[02:31:45] <davic> KatrinValerie: yup
[02:31:59] <HubertFarnsworth> Because of Internet KatrinValerie
[02:32:00] <TsundereNoises> exactly Aurora_v_kosmose
[02:32:07] <KatrinValerie> Why is it deemed impolite to ask for a break from social interaction?
[02:32:10] <denza242> davic: make sure to buy an Xbox Series X
[02:32:17] <denza242> KatrinValerie: phrasing is key
[02:32:26] <KatrinValerie> Like literally all of my meltdowns happen because people did not let me disengage
[02:32:30] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: I don't know, but I've had the argument that people don't have an obligation to strike up a conversation with you if you talk to them in public a lot
[02:32:32] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: I have issues with doing normal chores that most people can do, I have social phobia, bad memory, my concentration is quite shit, where for example if I get disturbed it can cause my whole day to be ruined
[02:32:34] <davic> For example
[02:32:38] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: and a lot of people get weirdly upset at the concept
[02:32:59] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: my medicine for my ADHD for example gives me side effects as dry mouth
[02:33:26] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: sorry I don't follow, who talks to whom in public in that argument?
[02:33:57] <HubertFarnsworth> Damn davic, you had it tough man
[02:34:05] <KatrinValerie> davic: are they also keeping you short on refills?
[02:34:06] <davic> HubertFarnsworth:  not really
[02:34:39] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean normal people fuck up their lives davic
[02:34:42] <KatrinValerie> still need a to find a specialist for med presciptions here... can't always get my meds from the GP
[02:34:50] <KatrinValerie> They can do it as an exception, but it blows their budget
[02:34:54] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: there's almost too many concurrent threads going on right now to get into it, but a recurring argument I have is that I think it's rude when people try to talk to you when you are OBVIOUSLY not interested in talking and doing something else, and some people vehemently seem to believe that if you are in public then you must be open for conversation
[02:35:02] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: my mom worked with people that has issues like this so she kinda saw it quite early. My dad still doesn't get it and kinda goes "Like, just do it." Even though I have told him several times that I can't just force myself to do it because I get overwhelmed quite easily
[02:35:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TsundereNoises: I find wearing earbuds or large very-visible headphones tends to send the appropriate signal.
[02:36:02] <HubertFarnsworth> davic: kudos to your mom
[02:36:18] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah but I've still had the argument a lot, even in here among the nerdfolk. Like that it's okay to just keep going up to someone and bugging them even if they are obviously signalling to be left alone
[02:36:29] <TsundereNoises> "What are you reading? What are you listening to?"
[02:36:48] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: oh that, I was once close to blowing up in some guys face who tried to talk up a girl at a bus stop. but staring at the guy actually made him give up lol
[02:36:57] <KatrinValerie> so I didn't even need to do anything
[02:37:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TsundereNoises: "I'm busy chummer and not in a social mood, poke me later"
[02:37:36] <TsundereNoises> "if she's too polite to tell you to fuck off she must be into you"

[02:39:34] <KatrinValerie> I mean sure, confrontation is bad when it gets physical, but we should teach girls that they can ask for help if they are being harrased by someone.
[02:39:55] <TsundereNoises> it really can be hard to be rude enough for some people to get the point though
[02:40:52] <KatrinValerie> And when I say raised here, I do not mean just the parents influence. We live in a society.
[02:41:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I started being blunt or borderline rude when I noticed being nice doesn't work.

[02:42:47] <KatrinValerie> Oh keeping the face or something
[02:42:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> My nation is not absurdly concerned with it, thank goodness. No idea how I'd cope if I were born in SEA
[02:43:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Probably badly.
[02:43:06] <KatrinValerie> That's even worse in asian culture
[02:44:12] <KatrinValerie> My last endocrinologist was asian and would always say things in a very roundabout way in an attempt to be polite. I just ended up not understanding what she was on about at all.

[02:57:57] <KatrinValerie> Btw, is the disney Loki genderfluid?
[02:58:01] <TsundereNoises> rather than immediately caving

[02:58:21] <KatrinValerie> Well anyways that is the term we'd use to describe it today
[02:59:37] <TsundereNoises> I mean I think it's in Loki's powerset to be whatever gender he wants, but Disney considers holding hands in the background to be groundbreaking levels of representation
[02:59:41] <TsundereNoises> so presumably not in the movies
[03:00:40] <TsundereNoises> and I mean, I'm pretty sure comics Loki sticks to male pronouns at least

[03:07:03] <KatrinValerie> jessedesu2: can you give me a discrete range?
[03:07:23] <jessedesu2> That's like asking how many times you piss a day
[03:07:26] <jessedesu2> It ranges
[03:07:30] <KatrinValerie> *concret
[03:07:32] <KatrinValerie> conrete
[03:07:40] <KatrinValerie> stupid math terminology differences
[03:07:51] <jessedesu2> Several is 3 to 11
[03:08:12] <jessedesu2> Or 4 to 10
[03:08:17] <jessedesu2> Or 5 to 9
[03:08:21] <jessedesu2> Lol

[03:08:50] <KatrinValerie> - to be read as to
[03:09:51] <TsundereNoises> for me, it depends on how much coffee or tea I'm drinking
[03:10:38] <jessedesu2> If nuclear missiles started exploding over the US I would smoke one last time
[03:10:58] <KatrinValerie> jessedesu2: don't look into the flashing lights though
[03:11:04] <jessedesu2> Or an asteroid
[03:11:09] <KatrinValerie> it would blind you instantaniously 
[03:11:40] <jessedesu2> Katrin hard to say exactly what you would do under those circumstances 
[03:12:13] <KatrinValerie> well, if you were in australia
[03:12:29] <KatrinValerie> read "On the beach" for a number of suggestions
[03:12:41] <snake> this is so fucking good, yo! i'm about to bust a nut over here
[03:12:56] <jessedesu2> If ur close enough to be blinded, the Shockwave will probably kill you via broken glass and other shrapnel
[03:13:07] <KatrinValerie> Uh snake don't do that, once it is busted you can't get it back

[03:14:49] <KatrinValerie> to stan == to be huge fan of something
[03:15:05] <KatrinValerie> The term was inspired by Eminems song Stan

[03:15:32] <KatrinValerie> No this is new internet culture
[03:15:34] <jessedesu2> Yes I've heard that song
[03:15:52] <jessedesu2> Dido became popular because of it
[03:15:59] <TsundereNoises> !seen kajo
[03:16:00] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: kajo was last seen in #anime 1 year and 3 months ago: <kajo> we will retake the lead
[03:16:10] <lastonestanding> dildo?
[03:16:24] <KatrinValerie> Nah, dido
[03:16:41] <KatrinValerie> The singer who's famous for songs like thank you or white flag
[03:16:56] <TsundereNoises> for whatever reason a lot of people have been subtitling oshi as "stan" recently
[03:17:06] <lastonestanding> "Florian Cloud de Bounevialle O'Malley Armstrong, known professionally as Dido, is an English singer and songwriter."
[03:17:12] <lastonestanding> ?!
[03:17:17] <TsundereNoises> also I'm pretty sure Dido was famous independently of that song
[03:17:21] <TsundereNoises> and before it? not sure when it came out
[03:17:35] <lastonestanding> Florian is not a female name, or?
[03:18:04] <KatrinValerie> In German it wouldn't
[03:19:35] <lastonestanding> the other names are pretty strange too
[03:19:39] <TsundereNoises> like I'm certain I knew who Dido was well before I knew who Eminem was
[03:19:54] <lastonestanding> how? she is british
[03:20:48] <KatrinValerie> lol did they increase the censoring on this song?
[03:20:54] <lastonestanding> artists from the UK aren't that well known in the US
[03:21:00] <KatrinValerie> just listened to it again and they cut out all the lines about selfharm
[03:22:14] <KatrinValerie> well considering the Werther effect
[03:22:21] <lastonestanding> I don't like her
[03:22:43] <lastonestanding> her music I mean
[03:22:54] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: I didn't
[03:23:30] <jessedesu2> I didn't know about letters to cleo until I saw the Josie and the pussycats movie
[03:24:26] <jessedesu2> Damn that was over 20 years ago
[03:28:14] <jessedesu2> My taste in music back in 2001 was strange
[03:28:31] <jessedesu2> Korn and deftones
[03:29:04] <lastonestanding> how is that strange?
[03:29:52] <lastonestanding> deftones are still pushing their style in 2021
[03:29:53] <KatrinValerie> I can't really remember what kind of music I listened to in 2001
[03:29:56] <Toadisattva> that was the best taste back then
[03:29:56] <lastonestanding> pretty amazing
[03:30:26] <jessedesu2> I was listening to the white stripes nirvana and blink 182
[03:30:54] <KatrinValerie> I think I was just watching MTV and pirating whatever
[03:31:04] <KatrinValerie> even listened to pop
[03:31:10] <jessedesu2> Kurt Cobain had been dead only several years
[03:31:13] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[03:31:23] <KatrinValerie> like the no angles
[03:31:24] <jessedesu2> Now it's like, 27 years
[03:31:40] <hassoon> 27 years ? that was my age in 2018
[03:31:42] <KatrinValerie> but slowly and steadily I moved towards rock music
[03:31:50] * hassoon drinks milk
[03:32:12] <KatrinValerie> rip Kurt
[03:32:14] <TsundereNoises> I slowly and steadily moved toward weeb music
[03:32:14] *** Joins: CuddlePup (~cuddlepup@user/cuddlepup)
[03:32:44] <hassoon> what's weeb music
[03:32:47] <KatrinValerie> rock music is simply at the core of my music taste, I listen to many many different things
[03:33:12] <jessedesu2> The Foo fighters is what comes to mind when you think of generic rock
[03:33:16] <KatrinValerie> even classical and orchestra music, just not as often as I enjoy these more in live concerts
[03:33:24] <TsundereNoises> I guess in some ways the "core of my taste" is probably jazz?
[03:33:24] <jessedesu2> Late 90s era
[03:33:31] <KatrinValerie> I hate the Foo Fighters
[03:33:38] <Toadisattva> hate the foo!?
[03:33:39] <TsundereNoises> I also hate the foo fighters
[03:33:40] <Toadisattva> how can you
[03:33:40] <KatrinValerie> They played at an aids denialist event
[03:33:53] <Toadisattva> aids denialist?
[03:33:56] <jessedesu2> What is that

[03:34:04] <TsundereNoises> I've been listening to what I listened to in the early 2000s a bit lately
[03:34:17] <KatrinValerie> Toadisattva: People that say HIV does not cause AIDS.
[03:34:41] <TsundereNoises> AIDS is caused by hurricane Katrina to punish the ho mo sexuals
[03:34:41] <KatrinValerie> The Foo Fighters got roped into that completetly nuts conspiracy theory
[03:34:47] <Toadisattva> I assume these must be yer standard flat earth covid hoax kinda people?
[03:34:52] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: :(
[03:34:59] <KatrinValerie> this makes me sad even if it is just a joke
[03:35:02] <Toadisattva> but really those morons were able to get the foo?
[03:35:06] <Toadisattva> I'm impressed honestly
[03:35:11] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: of course it's a joke, you know me
[03:35:30] <KatrinValerie> Toadisattva: nah, they spun it a lil bit better
[03:35:46] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: also I have always found that weird stupid-southern US way to say it "Ho-Mo-Sexual" weirdly amusing
[03:35:52] <jessedesu2> What other bands do you hate
[03:35:55] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: Yes I meant like it still makes me sad despite it being a joke
[03:35:58] <KatrinValerie> bad wording
[03:36:08] <TsundereNoises> oh good, for a minute I thought you were unsure if I was joking
[03:36:23] <lastonestanding> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0d2f_EqXNc
[03:36:24] <TsundereNoises> and I was wondering who the hell you thought I was

[03:36:25] <KatrinValerie> I don't really hate them
[03:36:59] <KatrinValerie> I just think they caused massive harm by giving their name to this bs
[03:37:25] <KatrinValerie> And homophobia is what made the HIV/AIDS crisis so bad
[03:38:01] <KatrinValerie> curious how treatments in the US only started to get approved when it was no longer deniable that it spread across the straight population as well.
[03:38:03] <lastonestanding> how?
[03:38:23] <KatrinValerie> Prior to that it was called GRIDS gay related immuno deficency
[03:38:40] <KatrinValerie> And the common belief was that the "homosexual lifestyle" caused it
[03:39:01] <KatrinValerie> Prejeduice can really cloud your vision
[03:39:08] <lastonestanding> anal sex you mean?
[03:39:25] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: HIV spreads through many more routes
[03:39:46] <lastonestanding> butt
[03:40:27] <KatrinValerie> Oh god I have a noisy bug in my room
[03:40:34] <KatrinValerie> Jesus Christ why?
[03:40:45] <lastonestanding> probably the smell of your room
[03:40:52] <KatrinValerie> Eh, too cowardly to answer on IRC it seems
[03:41:49] <lastonestanding> but now I wonder... how much less aids would there have been without gay people?
[03:41:58] <KatrinValerie> ...
[03:42:01] <lastonestanding> is there scientific data?
[03:42:30] <KatrinValerie> That is a question you cannot answer and it's not a useful question either
[03:42:37] <lastonestanding> Africa has much aids
[03:42:47] <lastonestanding> and hardly anyone there is gay
[03:42:50] <lastonestanding> I think
[03:42:57] <TsundereNoises> it was called "gay cancer" at one point
[03:43:06] <KatrinValerie> We have to deal with the situation either way
[03:43:08] <lastonestanding> in the US
[03:43:32] <TsundereNoises> lastonestanding: the issue was more where the initial outbreak population was
[03:43:33] <KatrinValerie> lastonestanding: the prevalence of homosexuality is the same everywhere, people just are closeted in intolerant countries.
[03:43:54] <KatrinValerie> They have to be, cause in many places homosexuality is still a crime.
[03:43:58] <TsundereNoises> lastonestanding: the first person that's relatively promiscuous to get it in the US was always going to spread it to whomever they were sleeping with
[03:44:02] <TsundereNoises> it worked out to be the gay community
[03:44:07] <ButterNoodle> everyone is intolerant of something
[03:44:18] <TsundereNoises> but also I seem to recall an airline stewardess spread a hell of a lot of aids too
[03:44:24] <KatrinValerie> Yeah, my girlfriend is lactose intolerant
[03:44:36] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: i mean if memory serves hiv is more transmissable through anal sex than other types
[03:44:38] <KatrinValerie> no matter how often I tell her to be more tolerant to it, she doesn't tolerate it >:D
[03:44:48] <theholyduck> sooo. the gay comunity was always going to be more at risk anyway
[03:44:56] <lastonestanding> oh wow
[03:44:57] <ButterNoodle> I'm intolerant of lactose intolerant people.. idk maybe it was how I was raised
[03:45:01] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: to some extent, but a) it'd still have spread via other sex (as it provably does and b) straight butt sex is a thing
[03:45:10] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  sure on both accounts
[03:45:11] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: for cis women it also depends on where they are in their cycle
[03:45:20] <TsundereNoises> part of the issue was dumb luck is what I'm saying
[03:45:21] <ButterNoodle> I love straight butt sex

[03:45:47] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: don't
[03:46:14] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: sure. but like the 2 main risk factors are anal sex and or doing injection drugs. and the gay comunity of the era was like a venn diagram of both those things
[03:46:19] <jessedesu2> $0.39
[03:46:20] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: its not THAT suprising they got hit the hardest 
[03:46:25] <ButterNoodle> the reason it was pinned on the ho mo sexuals was bc they were and ez scapegoat to allow the virus to propagate, until the cure was found
[03:46:31] <lastonestanding> do lesbians contribute to spreading aids?
[03:46:36] <ButterNoodle> that episode of southpark show us all the cure
[03:46:41] <theholyduck> lastonestanding:  much less so. 
[03:46:42] <lastonestanding> lesbians are gay too
[03:46:55] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: they also had less access to healthcare and still face discrimination in the medical system
[03:47:00] <theholyduck> lastonestanding:  basicly the most common method of spread is bodily fluid especially blood
[03:47:03] <KatrinValerie> so do I q.q
[03:47:04] <ButterNoodle> lastonestanding: most men dont look at women that way

[03:47:55] <ButterNoodle> yes TsundereNoises 
[03:47:56] <lastonestanding> indeed. it's very hot!
[03:48:10] <theholyduck> lastonestanding: which is why straight men dont have any ourage against lesbians
[03:48:11] <TsundereNoises> I mean , 2 dudes fucking each other in the ass is also natural, just worse

[03:48:41] <TsundereNoises> as Jesus said, "Fuck the poor"
[03:48:59] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie:  i think the point im tryign to make is that its not really just "happenstance" that it happened to hit the gay comunity so hard and so much
[03:49:01] <ButterNoodle> but the priests took that one too literal
[03:49:06] <theholyduck> it was perfectly set up to do so
[03:49:17] <KatrinValerie> theholyduck: nah they were vurnerable
[03:49:19] <jessedesu2> Jesus can feed 12,000 people with a 2 fish and a loaf of bread
[03:49:28] <KatrinValerie> nobody argues that

[03:49:45] <KatrinValerie> What is worse it that the government knew about the virus for a long time

[03:49:50] <KatrinValerie> before it was announced
[03:49:52] <jessedesu2> Is that how it goes, cuz I havent actually read the bible
[03:49:56] <lastonestanding> jessedesu2: two huge whales?

[03:52:38] <ButterNoodle> tru KatrinValerie..
[03:52:45] <KatrinValerie> though you can come to the same conclusions outside of a religious framework
[03:52:53] <ButterNoodle> thats the part of religion I havent abandoned completely
[03:53:03] <theholyduck> KatrinValerie: i mean some of the stories really dont though
[03:53:05] <KatrinValerie> and I prefer to base my ethics in philosophic reasoning
[03:53:09] <theholyduck> theres quite a lot of genocide and rape in the bible :P
[03:53:15] <ButterNoodle> a lot of it is really just 1:1 logic

[04:24:55] <wroathe> So I'm 6 episodes into this Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas thing on Netflix, and the whole anime has familiar qualities that I like, but the writing almost feels like a meme, or like the writers explicitly tried to play a prank on the studio. 
[04:25:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> oh?
[04:25:35] <wroathe> I just got to the part where the rose "saint" that we thought was killed somehow was now magically alive, and he's all of a sudden got the ability to break the threads of the puppetmaster guy with his roses
[04:25:48] <wroathe> Which begs the question, why didn't he just do that for himself during the preceding ordeal
[04:26:12] <TsundereNoises> isn't that just what happens when your source material is from the 80s?

[04:54:58] <TsundereNoises> someone save me
[04:55:41] <wroathe> Also, on the topic of this particular anime - the odd mixture of Christian and Greek theology and terminology doesn't feel planned out at all. For some reason the Pope is leader of the pantheon in this anime, instead of Zeus.
[04:56:11] <wroathe> And the greek soldiers are "saints"
[04:57:09] <wroathe> And it's not the kind of clever fusion that adds anything - it just feels like the writers are taking namings from a smattering of movies and tv shows they might have seen along the way
[04:57:11] <TsundereNoises> if I've learned anything from shounen anime it's that Japan has some weird ideas about the pope
[04:57:46] <theholyduck> i mean think of it like people in the west getting tatoos they think mean hope and glory
[04:57:50] <theholyduck> when it actually means goatsemen
[04:57:51] <TsundereNoises> the pope has a really big hat and is very good at magic, generally he's evil
[04:57:51] <theholyduck> or something
[04:58:07] <TsundereNoises> I mean 2/3 I guess
[04:58:09] <theholyduck> wroathe: they are just using something they know nothing about as a way to add spice
[04:58:11] <wroathe> theholyduck: Yup. Exactly.
[04:58:35] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: what if u get a tattoo that you think means goat seamen and it turns out to be hope and glory?
[04:58:39] <TsundereNoises> yeah but Japan has a weird obsession with christian iconography
[04:58:48] <theholyduck> i blame the portugese
[04:58:49] <TsundereNoises> at least certain kinds of shounen anime do
[04:58:53] <TsundereNoises> fair
[04:59:00] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  theres a decent minority of christians in japan
[04:59:03] <theholyduck> because of the portugese
[04:59:19] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: yes but I don't really believe those christians have ANYTHING to do with what I'm talking about
[04:59:26] <wroathe> Also, for some reason Athena is a teenage girl in this anime, and acts like it, instead of acting like an ageless immortal god. I'm hoping they explain that one.
[04:59:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TsundereNoises: DxD?
[04:59:59] <TsundereNoises> wroathe: she's just trying to give her dad a headache
[05:00:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> wroathe: Did you read the original myths? They did act like immature petulant bastards half of the time.
[05:00:21] <TsundereNoises> Aurora_v_kosmose: I mean, sure but not in particular
[05:00:27] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: weirdly chrstian weddings is supposedly the most common type
[05:00:28] <theholyduck> in japan
[05:00:45] <theholyduck> like. christian weddings in a church is the most common style of wedding in japan
[05:00:52] <wroathe> Aurora_v_kosmose: I'm sure I did a very long time ago, but I can't remember the details. I wouldn't be surprised. That said, I'd be very surprised if it were like this.

[05:13:46] <wroathe> Well, it's based on anime, anyway :P

[06:06:08] <BillyZane> i hear they have better food. being on a sub is like the worst assignment, so they give them bonuses
[06:06:35] <jessedesu_onaph> I've been in the Disneyland sub
[06:06:50] <jessedesu_onaph> That shit is so cool
[06:07:00] <jessedesu_onaph> You get to see mermaids
[06:07:11] <BillyZane> that sounds cool i haven't
[06:08:07] <BillyZane> i haven't been to disneyland in a long time. i wanna check out disney world
[06:08:09] <snake> idk who i am anymore ;-;
[06:08:20] <snake> i remember reading someone say that before and not even remotely understanding it
[06:08:29] <snake> but i feel it now
[06:08:48] <snake> because i have to accept anyone as a friend i became no one i think
[06:09:02] <snake> and now i left the discord server yesterday because i've had enough
[06:09:07] <snake> now what is left, nothing
[06:09:22] <snake> just irc, my friend, and his gf
[06:09:31] <snake> and my craptastic parents
[06:09:43] <snake> tho my friend has antisocial personality disorder
[06:09:50] <snake> and he frequently gives me bad advice in games
[06:09:56] <BillyZane> disneyland costs $159 to enter. a 3 year old has to pay $153, can you believe that
[06:09:58] <snake> starting to think he does it on purpose
[06:10:33] <wroathe> snake: Can you give us an example of this bad advice?
[06:11:33] <snake> wroathe, he said to grow canola and always sell crops at "the ranch" for the best profits without going to corn
[06:11:44] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: THC costs $150 to enter and $150 to finish
[06:11:56] <snake> i found using soybean is the easiest non-corn crop, and for another thing, corn prices are low
[06:12:07] <ButterNoodle> snake
[06:12:09] <BillyZane> THC?
[06:12:12] <ButterNoodle> the problem with corn
[06:12:13] <snake> what's more, prices vary each day and selling at different locations can be better
[06:12:15] <ButterNoodle> is corn in ur poop
[06:12:28] <snake> i rarely sell at the ranch actually
[06:12:28] <ButterNoodle> BillyZane: Tokyo Hentai Club
[06:12:34] <BillyZane> ButterNoodle, lol what
[06:12:40] <ButterNoodle> they are gaijin friendly

[06:17:28] <snake> ButterNoodle, when they say "trust me" it actually means "i have no clue im just doing what my boyfriend says, none of the words you're saying make anysense and i probably have 2 dual channels or some shit but again idk cause im retarded and morbidly obese"
[06:17:38] <snake> i sseriously do not get why she is friends with her
[06:18:22] <ButterNoodle> she may be 1/2 right tho
[06:18:38] <snake> lol
[06:18:53] <snake> yeah idk maybe she has quad channel
[06:19:06] <snake> she didnt say that tho, she said "nah bro its compatible TRUST"
[06:19:09] <snake> which is annoying af
[06:19:27] <ButterNoodle> if I can tell u the mass of the sun, and cant tell u how to find it... does it matter if I'm too stupid to calculate it if its the correct answer?
[06:19:27] <snake> i didnt say it wasnt compatible DICKHEAD
[06:19:44] <snake> exactly
[06:20:02] <snake> friendo said "you can disagree" im thinking but haven't said yet "imagine debating a retard and enjoying that"
[06:20:41] <ButterNoodle> ur gonna get yelled at for using the r word in a disparaging way

[06:23:22] <snake> but she sstill pretends she knows more than you and everyone else
[06:24:04] <snake> it's not really fair to the mentally hendicapped to use the word "retard" for her
[06:24:08] <ButterNoodle> just... dont be disrespectful to the differently abled by using the word to describe twitter people..

[06:24:44] <ButterNoodle> everything relates to anime
[06:24:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > 2 sticks of ram will be faster than 4 sticks | It honestly shouldn't make a difference unless allocation spans multiple sticks.

[06:25:41] <snake> but at least we can use these terms, talk about them, and disagree logically
[06:25:46] <ButterNoodle> 2 dual channels will actually run the same.. given same ram.. 
[06:25:53] <snake> and jessedesu_onaph can make a lewd joke and its funny

[06:26:51] <jessedesu_onaph> I don't own a single daft punk album
[06:26:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: One example where it'd make a difference is if you made a 16GB array. Of course it'd be a dumb idea, but you'd notice access latency change when it switches between them.
[06:27:11] <ButterNoodle> its been on a few jessedesu_onaph 
[06:27:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well. You'd "notice"... as far as test measurements go.

[06:27:26] <snake> Aurora_v_kosmose, oic
[06:28:02] <ButterNoodle> smaller amounts of ram over more channels is faster due to scan times on fatter sticks

[06:32:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Otherwise maximizing memory density so you can max out your board is the best.

[06:54:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Japan supposedly has safe eggs.
[06:54:44] <amigojapan> Yep Aurora_v_kosmose 
[06:54:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No idea if it has to do with poultry raising techniques or how the eggs are cleaned up & managed during logistics.
[06:55:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or if they're simply going "meh, salmonela won't kill you"
[06:55:12] <jessedesu_onaph> Japan has gacha dispensers for eggs
[06:55:14] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I heard they have controlled salmonella
[06:55:20] <jessedesu_onaph> Like in wonder egg priority
[06:55:52] <mathu> google is suggesting they wash eggs same as US
[06:55:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I know that some (all?) of the EU has vaccination of poultry to reduce that risk.
[06:56:30] <amigojapan> mathu: Aurora_v_kosmose they may also pasturise eggs
[06:56:30] <mathu> i eat cookie dough with raw egg and such, i know it's mostly safe if they're refrigerated. but raw eggs are slimy
[06:56:52] <mathu> maybe... i'll make cookies tonight...
[06:57:14] <jessedesu_onaph> Emeka can make muffins
[06:57:18] <amigojapan> mathu: also they have date of expiration written on each egg
[06:57:48] <mathu> i should learn a good muffin recipe

[07:01:35] <Sxem> id prefer if they wrote it on the package and i pay less for eggs
[07:01:40] <mathu> jessedesu_onaph: does emmeka talk about making muffins in here? should i ask him for a recipe?

[07:04:45] <jessedesu_onaph> Squid tastes gud
[07:05:06] <amigojapan> Sxem: I guess when you put it that way it does sound a bit rediculous
[07:05:10] <Sxem> i can probably think of many mroe reasons not to print on each egg, but i will stop thinking about it
[07:05:25] <mathu> lots of US eggs have a stamp on them, not with the date but with some sort of logo
[07:05:42] <amigojapan> Sxem: some eggs have printed on the egg, others use a stamp on the egg

[07:05:49] <ButterNoodle> ye
[07:06:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sxem: Eggs are stamped during processing prior to packaging, they're not necessarily put in the same packs together.

[07:09:29] <Sxem> they probably have to use some weak watered down food grade ink to avoid lawsuits, and then it just easily comes off just from touching your sweaty hands
[07:09:46] <Sxem> ink on the package can be real ink
[07:10:54] <Sxem> my eggs keep freezing in the fridge, even tho nothing else ever gets that cold. its like the eggs can suck in cold
[07:11:16] <Sxem> i dont know how they got this magical power
[07:11:57] <Sxem> if i put a thermometer in there, it says like 40 f
[07:12:07] <Sxem> yet the eggs still freeze
[07:12:09] <Sxem> makes no sense
[07:12:38] <Sxem> the eggs are 32 f, everything else in there is 40 f
[07:12:42] <amigojapan> Sxem: but some composites use stamps with the date on them
[07:12:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's edible inks and colorings that aren't so easily removed.
[07:13:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I would imagine any lacking quality is a cost-reduction measure.

[07:23:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Through some interesting chemistry they are. But be very careful about sourcing. Some shortcuts lead to a more toxic result.
[07:24:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The wiki page also mentions zinc and copper deficit. Probably worth keeping in mind.
[07:25:04] <amigojapan> I mean I never thought they were not safe to eat

[07:26:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Like most foods that involve fancier chemistry, shortcuts can be dangerous and the sourcing matters.

[07:28:05] <amigojapan> I see

[12:33:30] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: not surprising
[12:33:47] <DunceCotus> tried to appeal but no response.. so im not a huge fan of that channel or its moderation approach
[12:34:16] <amigojapan> Lalia also has strange ideas, she does not believe in true or false DunceCotus 
[12:35:00] <Nanobot> How can you not believe in true or false? True or false is true. But, true and false is false.
[12:36:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well I dunno what the context there is
[12:36:11] <DunceCotus> but sounds utterly banal

[12:40:40] <DunceCotus> you ban someone being outright abusive or trolling or spamming
[12:40:46] <DunceCotus> its not hard to work out who to ban and who to not
[12:40:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: depends on the OP.i think even some OPS here would ban you for it
[12:41:25] <DunceCotus> if you're going to ban people who have different viewpoints then sure
[12:41:42] <DunceCotus> I think the philosophy OPs ban whomever they don't like (for whatever reason)
[12:42:34] <DunceCotus> this is evidenced by the lack of any appeals process
[12:42:44] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there is an OP here the bans for saying conspiracy theories
[12:42:46] <DunceCotus> they don't want people to appeal cause its totally authoritarian
[12:43:08] <DunceCotus> well I don't do conspiracy theories
[12:43:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: your Mandela effect talks easily get confused for conspiracy theories
[12:44:38] <DunceCotus> its not conspiracy to talk about weird things
[12:45:00] <DunceCotus> like you can talk about ufos or ghosts without it being inherently conspiratorial

[12:46:42] <DunceCotus> lol area 59
[12:47:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yeah sure but you can discuss ufos without mentioning that side of things

[12:55:38] <amigojapan> Sadale: idle as in the python ide?
[12:56:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan why would Hollywood say that unless it wasn't true at some point
[12:56:09] <Sadale> amigojapan, no. Idle game as in a kind of game that you just put it there and wait for the score to get up.
[12:56:19] <DunceCotus> *wasn't = was
[12:56:23] <Sadale> amigojapan, you'd perform upgrade and you could get more score in a shorter amount of time
[12:56:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: cause it makes for better drama
[12:56:53] <Sadale> amigojapan, The interesting thing about this game is that the auto upgrade option can be purchased in early game (within 30 minutes). Then you could just put it here and wait :P
[12:57:02] <DunceCotus> but I haven't heard anyone from medical community take issue with it until very recently
[12:57:29] <amigojapan> Sadale: what is "upgrade"
[12:58:01] <Sadale> amigojapan, take it like a farming game. You just put in your seed, water it and wait for it to grow. An upgrade would be like purchasing a new piece of land, new corp, new tool for havesting, etc.
[12:58:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: argument from ignorance as usual
[12:58:48] <amigojapan> Ah ok Sadale 
[12:59:01] <DunceCotus> well the question is why all these years without argument against it
[12:59:35] <DunceCotus> like I did hear before that it was inaccurate how they portray defibrillation in movies but not that defibrillation doesn't restart heart
[12:59:44] <DunceCotus> more that it takes a certain way of using it to do so
[13:00:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they probably did not think it would affect the actual medical field
[13:01:04] <ButterNoodle> those AEDs on every corner scare the shit out of me
[13:01:21] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: why
[13:02:10] <amigojapan> Because people drop dead all the time?
[13:02:20] <ButterNoodle> luckily most of them have some smarts built in to actually detect if someones heart is in defib
[13:03:07] <ButterNoodle> if they didnt the automatic part.. people would die due to improper use
[13:03:09] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: have you read the instructions? They are hard to use
[13:03:34] <ButterNoodle> the real ones are.. you have to be trained to know if someone needs to be shocked
[13:04:14] <amigojapan> Ok but the ones they have in jr stations have complex instructions
[13:04:22] <ButterNoodle> *good
[13:04:40] <ButterNoodle> I think a japanese person would be less inclined to use one anyway
[13:04:47] <ButterNoodle> they would call for help
[13:04:56] <amigojapan> Yup

[13:07:57] <ButterNoodle> anyway.. bedtime
[13:08:00] <ButterNoodle> nn o/
[13:08:09] <DunceCotus> these days the best way to restart heart is ephedrine injected straight into heart 
[13:08:10] <amigojapan> Mississippi? What did I mean
[13:08:21] <DunceCotus> and most hollywood films show this instead of (just) defibrillation
[13:08:25] <amigojapan> NN ButterNoodle don't die

[13:09:19] <DunceCotus> sorry I think its adrenaline injection
[13:09:43] <DunceCotus> you see those movies when someone has cardiac arrest and they STAB them in the chest with a needle
[13:09:54] <DunceCotus> and you're like jesus christ he's already ded
[13:09:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: as long as doctors know the real thing that is what matters no?
[13:10:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well doctors also don't acknowledge human anatomy changed
[13:10:36] <DunceCotus> so we can't always rely on em
[13:11:28] <HubertFarnsworth> that reminds me, my brother's work is on stents amigojapan 
[13:11:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan it may relate to a change of the position in the heart in the chest
[13:11:35] <DunceCotus> the heart used to be on the left side of the chest, now its center
[13:11:54] <amigojapan> !c stents
[13:11:55] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: In medicine, a stent is a metal or plastic tube inserted into the lumen of an anatomic vessel or duct to keep the passageway open, and stenting is the placement of a stent.

[13:13:46] <DunceCotus> but we learned it was explicitly on the left side, like the whole heart

[13:14:36] <JesseDesu> what is love
[13:14:40] <JesseDesu> baby dont hurt me
[13:15:44] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: "Your heart is located between your lungs in the middle of your chest, behind and slightly to the left of your breastbone (sternum). A double-layered membrane called the pericardium surrounds your heart like a sac.
[13:16:02] <HubertFarnsworth> JesseDesu: Love is like k-on
[13:16:12] <JesseDesu> nice
[13:16:22] <JesseDesu> !c HubertFarnsworth 
[13:16:23] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, or simply Professor Farnsworth, is a fictional character in the American animated television series Futurama.
[13:16:24] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: no. Electrical engineering I can even partially understand
[13:16:30] <JesseDesu> oh that guy
[13:16:50] <HubertFarnsworth> that doesn't mean it is easy amigojapan :p
[13:16:53] <JesseDesu> i like talking to engineers at work
[13:16:59] <JesseDesu> they are smart
[13:17:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan another thing I noticed is that the stomach and liver are way higher up, they are now in the chest cavity under the ribs
[13:17:23] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: they use special parts to avoid interference with each other. Which eliminates the need to understand Maxwell's equations
[13:17:32] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: Electromagnetism, Electrodynamics are some of the hard hard concepts for most students here
[13:17:43] <DunceCotus> and the abdominal cavity seems exclusively for intestines now
[13:18:14] <JesseDesu> !seen saganman
[13:18:14] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: saganman was last seen in ##otaku 25 days and 21 hours ago: <saganman> amigojapan: here people put black salt on watermelon
[13:18:23] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: I once was so much in love with Electromagnetism that I wanted to get them tattooed
[13:18:28] <DunceCotus> so when you eat a lot, its actually going into a suck under your ribs, not in your 'tummy' area :/
[13:18:32] <DunceCotus> its really friggin odd
[13:18:33] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that makes sense, they need to be protected
[13:18:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan it was never under the ribs is what im saying
[13:19:05] <DunceCotus> the stomach and liver were in abdominal cavity
[13:19:08] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: what exactly would you get tattooed?
[13:19:26] <HubertFarnsworth> Maxwell's equations amigojapan 
[13:19:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan the abdominal area has stretched.. check out how long the average abdomen is
[13:19:38] <amigojapan> Ah gotcha HubertFarnsworth 
[13:20:46] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: my interest was on the areas where standard electromagnetism or quantum mechanics didn't have proper explanation

[13:21:43] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth that goes over my head
[13:21:53] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: like Maxwell's Equations don't explain how we get steady electromagnetic equilibrium
[13:22:05] <amigojapan> Ok

[13:22:39] <amigojapan> Let me see DunceCotus 
[13:23:06] <HubertFarnsworth> what's up with his chest?
[13:23:19] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth that's normal apparently (except the hernia)
[13:23:28] <DunceCotus> stomach is now that far up -- in the chest  :/
[13:23:38] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: DunceCotus thinks human anatomy had changed from the past
[13:24:23] <DunceCotus> I clearly remember learning human anatomy when I was young, even reading my mum's nursing textbooks with detailed anatomical diagrams
[13:24:30] <DunceCotus> human anatomy has changed considerably since then
[13:24:56] <DunceCotus> (my Mum doesn't notice any changes)
[13:25:10] <HubertFarnsworth> maybe the books are wrong DunceCotus 
[13:25:25] <HubertFarnsworth> or you misremembered 
[13:25:28] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth she never had those books.. they don't exist in this universe
[13:25:43] <DunceCotus> though I need to ask her if she remembers them
[13:25:53] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: he also thinks the position of this solar system is different from the past too
[13:26:02] <DunceCotus> but I looked for those nursing books recently and couldn't find them
[13:26:13] <DunceCotus> I don't think she would have got rid of them, they were premium quality
[13:26:28] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: well tbh the universe is expanding
[13:27:06] <DunceCotus> it seems our digestion system kinda sucks in this universe
[13:27:19] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I think it is because he is comparing maps of the galaxy from the 90s to maps made now
[13:27:20] <DunceCotus> which may explain all the digestion woes people have been having recently
[13:27:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan no, that's exactly what im not doing
[13:27:42] <HubertFarnsworth> btw amigojapan, do you know our stomachs have to constantly release mucus so the stomach acids won't eat up the stomach?
[13:27:53] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean stomach acids keep on producing
[13:27:57] <HubertFarnsworth> no end
[13:27:59] <DunceCotus> maps of the galaxy from the 90s would be similar to today's maps
[13:28:19] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yeah I think you said that before
[13:28:30] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: that's so weird
[13:28:44] <DunceCotus> like why the fuck is the stomach under rib cage
[13:28:47] <DunceCotus> that doesnt make sense
[13:28:59] <HubertFarnsworth> the way our bodies work defies normal logic
[13:29:02] <DunceCotus> tummy generally refers to abdomen and in relation to stomach region
[13:29:08] <DunceCotus> but stomach is not in abdomen :S
[13:29:14] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: pretty sure a slug needs to make mucous to move
[13:29:33] <JesseDesu> ever killed a snail with salt?
[13:29:40] <DunceCotus> by the time food gets to 'tummy' its mostly digested
[13:29:45] <JesseDesu> every 1st grader has done it
[13:29:52] <HubertFarnsworth> nah, hardly see snails
[13:29:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: people used to think the mind was in the heart too

[13:32:41] <DunceCotus> so next time you eat, imagine the food has settled into a sac under your ribs
[13:32:48] <DunceCotus> truly bizarre
[13:33:34] <Sadale> ew
[13:34:21] <DunceCotus> the language inconsistency is what makes me think this isn't a matter of moving to a parallel universe
[13:34:34] <DunceCotus> but its rather a modification of the universe (simulation theory?)
[13:35:06] <DunceCotus> or we were pulled out of our former universe, perhaps it got destroyed, and placed into a newly generated universe

[13:37:55] <DunceCotus> amigojapan the truth of the matter is.. fuckin bizarre shit happening
[13:37:57] <amigojapan> People not pursue
[13:38:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan perhaps this started or accelerated in 2012
[13:38:36] <DunceCotus> that was a strange year for me, 2013 is when I felt like I was in a different body altogether
[13:38:42] <DunceCotus> with strange proportions
[13:38:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan even eyelashes changed.. they're more hair-like now
[13:39:04] <JesseDesu> the lead singer/guitarist of the peggies is such a cutie
[13:42:30] <DunceCotus> eyelashes used to be a different kind of material.. more chitinous, harder
[13:42:39] <DunceCotus> now they are soft and more like hair in consistency
[13:44:01] <CyberTailor> DunceCotus: mammals can't produce chitin
[13:44:28] <DunceCotus> CyberTailor well a harder keratin then
[13:44:28] <CyberTailor> only anthropoda and fungi do 
[13:44:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: well undoubtedly you think these things are true, but the majority of people don't think such a sudden change is possible
[13:45:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan its not only possible, its happened
[13:45:36] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: then why don't we realise?
[13:45:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan like I am not trying to attention-seek.. its just so much has changed
[13:45:50] <DunceCotus> and I find it disconcerting so few can see the changes
[13:46:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I don't know
[13:46:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan some of us do
[13:46:17] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:47:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I think this goes back to the Body without Organs
[13:48:22] <amigojapan> Right DunceCotus 
[13:48:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan like if you fall onto the surface of the BwO, it repels this cause it doesn't want to be organised
[13:48:44] <DunceCotus> in doing so that may have destroyed our former organisation and necessitated a whole new organisation
[13:49:03] <DunceCotus> however as language is recorded on the BwO, the language has stayed largely the sam
[13:49:04] <DunceCotus> e
[13:49:09] <DunceCotus> but everything else has changed
[13:50:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan most people can't or won't notice this change because this has been anti-produced from the socius
[13:50:10] <DunceCotus> that is to say it gets violently repressed

[13:51:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan why is why Haruhi was so powerful
[13:51:41] <amigojapan> See DunceCotus this sounds very conspiracy. Like there is a plan to stop this information
[13:52:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan there's no plan to it though.. its more like the way the socius is formed requires repression
[13:52:29] <DunceCotus> nobody is planning this, or has devised a way to keep this information from public
[13:52:38] <DunceCotus> because public can and do still notice it
[13:52:52] <DunceCotus> but the way we respond to this will differ depending on how we repress it

[13:53:25] <amigojapan> Hey lastonestanding
[13:53:40] <lastonestanding> hello amigojapan
[13:54:16] <DunceCotus> amigojapan that our language doesn't seem to match up with the changes seems to imply it isnt a matter of moving to another perhaps parallel universe (or not simply)
[13:54:33] <DunceCotus> but more a dissolution of our universe into another, or another was generated after the destruction of our former
[13:54:44] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: and you yourself also said you rather live in a stable universe if I remember correctly
[13:55:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan well we can't help but live in a stable universe, but the point is its internally inconsistent with our historical record
[13:56:00] <DunceCotus> cause our historical record is in part due to language, and this has been recorded on the surface of the Body without Organs (as socius)
[13:56:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I think this has happened multiple times
[13:57:14] <DunceCotus> a collapse onto the BwO, then a repulsion, and new organisation of desiring machines
[13:57:34] <DunceCotus> however what complicates this is the BwO is also produced...
[13:58:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I think a 'weak' collapse onto BwO happens every night as we fall asleep
[13:59:01] <DunceCotus> but there are more dramatic ones, like death or through use of psychedelics etc
[13:59:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan think of it like everyone exists in a milieu (or middle)
[14:00:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: psychedelics can probably mess you up yes
[14:00:42] <DunceCotus> yeah but it reconfigures everything as well
[14:01:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan and I mean everything
[14:01:20] <DunceCotus> however the extent of the changes will vary
[14:01:28] <DunceCotus> death will cause more dramatic changes imo
[14:02:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I think the way things change is along a 4D or nD axis
[14:04:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan think of it like if you die then desiring-machines have broken down to such an extent that their former configuration is untenable
[14:04:44] <DunceCotus> so a new configuration is necessary to pursue desire for life
[14:05:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: not just any consideration of organs would work
[14:06:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan right, its related to how we desired 'before'
[14:06:19] <DunceCotus> and how this can be approximated but still operate going forward in a new configuration
[14:07:14] <DunceCotus> the way flows of desire have been 'written' or recorded on the BwO will determine how the next network of desiring-machines is produced
[14:08:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: by the way. I got my hands on a book by be deluze but I don't think it is one of the ones you mentioned

[19:14:53] <DunceCotus> one thing that pissed me off about the micro is that if you play a GB game in it and stretch it to wide
[19:14:57] <DunceCotus> it'd cut off the sides 
[19:15:10] <DunceCotus> cause they made the screen slightly smaller than it was with GBA
[19:15:17] <DunceCotus> which is a really bizarre choice
[19:15:31] <amigojapan> Ah right
[19:18:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: probably cause the idea was a NES controller with a screen on it
[19:24:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but it was Nintendo that killed off the micro cause they launched the DS in a very close date. What were they thinking

[22:30:45] <chameleon> oof
[22:31:49] <ButterNoodle> damn druglady... that looks real wholesome
[22:31:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The solution would be to actually fix the problem or to switch over to a protocol that is less vulnerable to that issue.
[22:31:58] <ButterNoodle> I want to be bought by a cute girl
[22:32:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Distributed designs like IPFS are less vulnerable to it, for instance.
[22:32:37] <chameleon> we should just stop using the internet

[22:34:21] <ButterNoodle> its fun and necessary... if ur canadian
[22:34:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> chameleon: To a point, but at the moment it's basically choosing the worst option while several better ones exist but see no use... for no reason.
[22:35:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or rather, because the efficency of their design does help maximize corporate control and profitability.
[22:35:20] <ButterNoodle> druglady: if u would be so kind as to lmk when new chapters of this stuff is available :)
[22:35:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because singular control is inefficient and therefore contrary to the design goals.

[22:36:15] <druglady> there are too many things to keep track of
[22:36:18] <chameleon> I mean, I totally get your point. I used to be involved in all these alternative options and stuff but it's honestly depressing how little interest people have in switching, even if they agree with you why the current things suck

[22:38:23] <druglady> no
[22:38:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: That's actually part of the problem too, related in part to the protocol flaws I mentioned.
[22:38:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Having to buy something because the only proper workaround is to get more servers is indicative that the protocols aren't good-enough.
[22:39:20] <ButterNoodle> ur saying you need to be amazon and just out compute multi terabit ddos attacks?
[22:39:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Yes. And I'm saying that this shows the protocol is badly thought-out. 
[22:39:51] <ButterNoodle> to witch some of the recent ones had amazon breaking a sweat
[22:39:57] <chameleon> just let your website crash until whoever's sad enough to ddos it gets bored and goes to do something else. that's what let it fail means right
[22:40:24] <ButterNoodle> lets get the pitchforks and torches after the people that wrote the ip-stack rfc's
[22:40:34] <ButterNoodle> 65535 ports are just not enough
[22:40:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> IP is technically not the issue per say.
[22:40:51] <ButterNoodle> port limitations are
[22:41:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's just that something like IPFS shouldn't be some exotic stack. It shoudl be the basic sort of thing everything is built atop of.
[22:41:08] <chameleon> oh I missed out on using port 42069 for my bnc
[22:41:14] <ButterNoodle> its really an upstream issue as #archlinux would say
[22:41:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Port limitations are indeed really stupid and I'm not sure why it's still limited at 65k
[22:41:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Shove a varint in there damnit
[22:42:49] <ButterNoodle> not inherently a problem with the web code, or html, or tls, or tcp, more a problem with the network protocol
[22:42:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> True.
[22:43:08] <ButterNoodle> but we have baked that 65535 limit in all protocols that I know of
[22:43:11] <ButterNoodle> well
[22:43:14] <ButterNoodle> modern ones
[22:43:20] <ButterNoodle> idk if LAT had that problem
[22:43:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But I mostly mean that everything which doesn't need a single endpoint shouldn't be built atop the raw bare single-endpoint protocols.
[22:43:42] <ButterNoodle> multicast fixes that /s
[22:44:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It wouldn't quite, although it would help if it actually existed outside LAN
[22:44:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It helps on the push/seeding side, but not on the pulling side.
[22:44:39] <ButterNoodle> that was sarcasm... it has some serious limitations and usefulness 
[22:44:46] <ButterNoodle> and its a real ass fuck to get working on an enterprise network
[22:45:07] <ButterNoodle> working properly and efficiently...
[22:45:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, it isn't suitable to task as it currently is.

[22:47:45] <ButterNoodle> cookies, secure cookies, irlues, certificates... pretty much anything outside of running the app on a box

[22:50:02] <snake> fuck docker
[22:50:06] <ButterNoodle> yea its like that everywhere
[22:50:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, there are some benefits to containers. Security isn't one of them.
[22:50:46] <ButterNoodle> snake: hitler used docker.. if he didn't we'd all be sprechen sie deutsch
[22:51:00] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: networking is ass in containers.. its good for dev tho
[22:51:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: It helps facilitate deployment and orchestration.
[22:51:45] <snake> dev is getting more and more complex as the years go on
[22:51:52] <ButterNoodle> there is a reason that actual virtualization won over crap like openvz
[22:51:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Although Guix's portable tarballs demonstrate that containers are utterly unnecessary for the deployment part.
[22:52:08] <snake> pretty sure you will need a 1tb harddrive just to hold all the tools apps and frameworks you need to create a "hello world" and deploy it
[22:52:13] <ButterNoodle> just get better at ansible and deploy on vm's
[22:52:29] <ButterNoodle> delete docker
[22:53:05] <ButterNoodle> I mean the real concept is like having an install shield package for ur linux box
[22:53:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Given that I use ansible for a large part of my own lab (and salt at work & on qubes), it's not quite there for orchestration.
[22:53:14] <ButterNoodle> swap out the ver and keep the data
[22:53:21] <ButterNoodle> which is how it should work anyway

[22:53:48] <ButterNoodle> puppet then
[22:54:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Pull-mode is available in ansible and salt too.
[22:54:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's not what I mean.
[22:54:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You need to setup those images to pull in the first place.
[22:54:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And decide how many to scale and how.
