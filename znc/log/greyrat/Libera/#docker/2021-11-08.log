[00:09:19] <rawtaz> SpeakerToMeat: im not sure waht you mean. what directive/setting in docker-compose are you suggesting creates a volume AND populates it with some files?
[00:09:39] <rawtaz> yes, use 127.0.0.1 for that
[00:11:01] <SpeakerToMeat> from my experience and documentation with docker-compose, if you list a volume for a service (and the mount point in the service) if the volume doesn't exist, the first time the stack is brought up the volume is created, and populated with any files existing in the mount point for the volume in the container.
[00:13:01] <rawtaz> so if you do e.g. myvolume:/data and there were some files in /data in the container, they are copied to the volume the first time the container is started with the volume?
[00:14:15] <SpeakerToMeat> if the volume doesn't exist. Yes
[00:14:34] <SpeakerToMeat> If it exists, wether it's empty or has something, nothing is copied.
[00:15:23] <rawtaz> right
[00:16:54] <rawtaz> i did not know that
[00:17:07] <rawtaz> and im not sure i think its a good thing lol, but who cares about that
[00:18:27] <SpeakerToMeat> It's a shortcut for doing some stuff. And it makes sense when you build a container with some sort of data built via COPY but which can be modified and preserved on a volume
[00:20:28] <rawtaz> yeah its just a bit too magic perhaps
[00:21:00] <SpeakerToMeat> Maybe

[00:43:08] <rawtaz> the problem can very well be a process in the container that fails to start. you can change the CMD or ENTRYPOINT of the container using your compose file, then enter it and manually run the command that's normally supposed to start - then you might be able to see why it fails. perhaps it has a verbose flag as well.

[00:53:57] <rawtaz> ok
[00:54:18] <rawtaz> but like, if that doesnt happen with other containers you have, perhaps theres something wrong with it :o
[00:54:37] <SpeakerToMeat> Well maybe I can't run debian on docker·...
[00:54:46] <SpeakerToMeat> Same happens for a "docker run debian:latest"

[00:59:39] <SpeakerToMeat> Sigh
[01:00:14] <SpeakerToMeat> of course this is part of a stack.... and debian starts bash which needs -ti, so, I'm trying to find what's a good CMD to have a pure debian in a docker container without any terminal

[01:01:55] <rawtaz> perhaps
[01:02:25] <rawtaz> yes, you can put stuff like that, entrypoint, tty, stdin_open and so on in your compose file

[01:08:47] <SpeakerToMeat> tabakhase, for the way they work, and want to work, appart from setting them a wordpress container and a mariadb container, I'd have to a) use a bind mount to a directory for wordpress files, where I could point an sftp container to. b) open two ssh->docker terminal containers to allow them shell access to the wordpress container, and the mariadb one.
[01:09:02] <SpeakerToMeat> rawtaz, Nope, Best Friend Forever
[01:09:42] <rawtaz> thanks :)
[01:09:47] <SpeakerToMeat> tabakhase, My problem is my vps is running on xen. And I worry about stacking anything else on top of that... though maybe OpenVZ, but I've not had any experience with openvz ever
[01:10:15] <rawtaz> i have. it's great in many ways but i wouldnt run it again. also im not sure how current it is, isnt it abandoned? :O
[01:10:27] <rawtaz> i dunno. i just dont see the point of it when theres other tech for that type of thing
[01:10:28] <tabakhase> rawtaz id go as far as "you literally cant" - the one exception of "CI" isnt even rly valid as at that point your system-under-test is uite far gone from reality anyhow...
[01:10:46] <rawtaz> mm
[01:11:17] <rawtaz> SpeakerToMeat: what is the problem with a VM though? it running on xen should be fine no?
[01:11:28] <SpeakerToMeat> Ok, any vm you can suggest for me to stack inside my vm... to give them easy access?
[01:11:40] <rawtaz> what do you mean? they have ssh?
[01:11:46] <tabakhase> rawtaz or like, "sure cgroups can do that, but use LXC not docker as interface"
[01:11:49] <rawtaz> a VM is the virtual machine
[01:11:58] <rawtaz> tabakhase: that sounds sense-making
[01:13:07] <SpeakerToMeat> Hmmm I'll look at lxc. I've not worked with it, and my impression is it was sort of a "docker for desktop apps".... 
[01:13:10] <SpeakerToMeat> I'm probably wrong
[01:13:25] <rawtaz> SpeakerToMeat: let's rewind here. you already have a Xen server on which you have a bunch of VMs, is this correct?
[01:13:35] <SpeakerToMeat> No.
[01:13:47] <tabakhase> and why even bother to share a vps... let the man sign up for gpc and he gets a free vm just for him anyhow...
[01:13:48] <SpeakerToMeat> I have a DomU to my name, inside a provider's Dom0
[01:13:59] <tabakhase> like - you two made out whos getting port 80 yet? :P
[01:14:52] <SpeakerToMeat> tabakhase, me of course. as I already have several domains that I'm migrating to this vps (comming from a, everything was together vps), I have an nginx that'll deal with ports 80 and 443, certificates, and reverse proxying the domains to the correct containers
[01:14:53] <tabakhase> (and the price for an additional IP is exceeding the price of the vm itself with some hosters these days...)
[01:14:53] <rawtaz> SpeakerToMeat: i mean the little they need could be hosted on a simple cheap VPS for like 3 bucks per month over at hetzner.cloud (which now has US datacenters)
[01:15:05] <rawtaz> just setting one up for him there is 100% easier and quicker for you
[01:15:13] <SpeakerToMeat> for my own services, I will use containers the "right" way. Stacks for each domain. 
[01:15:27] <rawtaz> by stacks do you mean compose files/solutions?
[01:15:31] <SpeakerToMeat> rawtaz, for some people and situations $3 a month is not trivial
[01:15:36] <SpeakerToMeat> rawtaz, yes
[01:16:04] <rawtaz> i agre. and theres even cheaper i think. but it will still be like one or two bucks a month
[01:16:25] <SpeakerToMeat> The cheapest I've ever seen was an extremely limited one at ramnode for $15 a year
[01:16:27] <rawtaz> i just look at this from a distance and see how you have to do a lot of work to support this silly wordpress website of his hehe
[01:16:34] <rawtaz> i think it's not worth it for you. but i hear you
[01:16:43] <rawtaz> mhm
[01:16:43] <SpeakerToMeat> my friend asked me the favor since i already have this server for home and work but.
[01:16:51] <rawtaz> yeah thats fair
[01:17:11] <rawtaz> ok so anyway. what you can do is probably something like LXC or whatever else linux has for that type of thing nowaday
[01:17:16] <tabakhase> https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-tier
[01:17:20] <rawtaz> but it will still not be simple for him
[01:17:23] <SpeakerToMeat> rawtaz, thank you.
[01:17:40] <SpeakerToMeat> I'm SO used to "That should never be done!" type responses
[01:17:43] <tabakhase> a e2-micro is literally free forever for everyone
[01:17:50] <rawtaz> what about you just set up a WP+DB+whatever container solution for him, and he only uses WP admin instead?
[01:18:22] <tabakhase> and boy the fun when his wordpress gets hacked and starts sending out spam to get your IP locked up :P
[01:18:33] <SpeakerToMeat> I wish, That was the first idea, but he's "prosumer".
[01:18:35] <rawtaz> yeah that is a real potential problem
[01:18:42] <SpeakerToMeat> Yes, that's true
[01:18:57] <rawtaz> SpeakerToMeat: what do you think of the ec2 micro suggestion? it might be enough
[01:19:08] <SpeakerToMeat> Though he's using his gmail for email, I'm not gonna give him addresses on my mta
[01:19:24] <rawtaz> tabakhase: thanks for being so constructive even though i bet you're laughing your ass off behind that screen :-)
[01:19:40] <tabakhase> php wordpress addons gont give a f. about your mta - they just start blastin :P
[01:19:43] <rawtaz> SpeakerToMeat: yeah but if his website needs to send out mail. i guess however it can do that via gmail
[01:19:55] <rawtaz> (there goes his gmail credentials too, btw :P)
[01:20:32] <SpeakerToMeat> tabakhase, yes but that depends on your php config as well.. at the very least, without a login on my mta, he's not sending through it.
[01:20:43] <rawtaz> FWIW you can use mailgun for free for $enough basic mail sending
[01:20:59] <rawtaz> i use it for a real production site, works great!

[01:25:19] <rawtaz> i would set up the docker-compose solution with WP+DB+whatever he needs for him, and then let him use those services from the outside. that's the pragmatic solution - it meets your current infrastructure, and it lets you do a reasonable amount of work, and he gets to use what he needs

[01:26:18] <rawtaz> that wouldnt cost you nor him any time or money
[01:27:35] <rawtaz> and FWIW when he signs up with amazon he'll get a ton of services for free for a year, so he can go way beyond that micro instance if he wants to try stuff out on a bigger scale (within limits of course)
[01:28:18] <tabakhase> i mean, yea i also hosted vps for 'friends' - but that was in 2004 when you HAD to pitch together to get a dedicated - and if one of those were to torrent with it, noone gave a shit back then lol :P --- in 2021 where your very own server starts at "free" and gets "totally legit" at minimal prices and law-enforcment starting to understand the internet, HELL no...

[19:45:43] <blackwood821> The interesting thing is that the container can ping the IP, it just can't resolve the hostname to an IP, yet /etc/resolv.conf is the same as my other centos container which is able to resolve the hostname

[19:58:07] <ash_worksi> what _you_ said makes sense at least
[19:58:10] <blackwood821> programmerq: `drill <hostname> @192.168.65.5` prints the correct IP in the answer section, yet `ping <hostname>` gives "bad address"

[19:58:57] <ash_worksi> I typically just vomit everything in environment:

[20:00:01] <ash_worksi> I know this isn't really a docker question, but does anyone know if for the nginx image you _have_ to mount *_params files to /tmp/*_temp files?
[20:00:07] <tabakhase> env-file comes in when that list gets long, like rly long - and then potentially also hared with multiple containers... - then whacking it in one file can be cleaner than a 400line compose file ash_worksi
[20:00:11] <ikke> blackwood821: can you show the first 2 lines of the drill command output
[20:00:56] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: makes sense
[20:01:56] <ash_worksi> re nginx, like, the container readme says you can run nginx as a less privileged user; I assume for the purpose of debugging your directives

[21:12:40] <rawtaz> blackwood821: you feel that pasted *text* is more sensitive than whats in an image, i presume?
[21:14:22] <rawtaz> lol, what the heck did they do
[21:15:33] <blackwood821> Yep, works on alpine 3.12 but not on alpine 3.13 and 3.14
[21:16:33] <rawtaz> good reason to use debian then :D
[21:17:15] <rawtaz> but on a more serious note, what other "tight" and possibly hardened docker images is there that can be recommended, for when you wnat to run slim/tight/hardened containers?
[21:17:27] <blackwood821> haha
[21:18:32] <blackwood821> If I run into other issues I might switch to debian (bullseye-slim)

[22:45:33] <rawtaz> unless im mistaken there is a command to strip control chars like that from output.. i mean not in docker but a separate command

[22:46:29] <xMopx> in older versions of docker the output would be allowed to scroll like a normal log
[22:46:50] <xMopx> but for some reason they decided to hide all that useful output. Which is very stupid
[22:46:56] <zoredache> ah, the buildkit output.
[22:47:21] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.46.64)
[22:47:30] <zoredache> Add  `--progress=plain` to your build command

[22:48:42] <xMopx> hmm thats better, but it still prefixes the output with stuff
[22:49:10] <xMopx> thanks

[22:51:46] <ash_worksi> if I add mailhog to my compose file but i have to change the port mapping to 1026:1025; I don't have to tell other services on the docker network to use 1026 right?
