[09:38:26] <greenbagels> Hi friends; I'm trying to split up parsing a file into multiple functions
[09:39:42] <greenbagels> but it seems like if i pass the same IOStream object to each function, it seeks to the beginning of the file each time
[09:40:13] <greenbagels> reading online, this seems related to the call-by-sharing semantics that julia uses; does this mean the IOStream object is immutable, and I should look for another wya to accomplish this?

[10:45:30] <greenbagels> actually, now it works; weird, must have been a bug i introduced
