[00:05:54] <jan6> that's kinda obvious phrase
[00:05:55] <jan6> lol
[00:06:38] <JimBuntu> yeah, not super tricky, but good to filter based on
[00:07:14] <jan6> similarly I've seen some random mail like "we would like to buy your product" or such, extremely nondescript
[00:08:58] <JimBuntu> Well, I was able to get an exact match from one other person via search engine with that phrase, but only one

[14:58:59] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: what country was the traffic coming from?
[15:00:07] <Hydragyrum> lol I haven't even bothered looking at the origin, it's guaranteed to be some skiddie with some sort of port scanner + bruter deal
[15:01:37] <Joanna> I know someone in Australia who says bots from China are always scanning him
[15:02:03] <Joanna> How do they find your server so fast ?
[15:03:49] <Hydragyrum> no clue, might just be how many of those things are running, one was probably bound to find mine

[15:05:30] <Joanna> The internet is certainly full of things exploring every address
[15:06:38] <Joanna> Canâ€™t you configure it to not allow remote logins at all ?
[15:32:47] <fnk> well there are services like shodan or zoomeye that help with discovering accessible network services
[15:35:27] <Hydragyrum> It's a dedicated server in a datacenter
[15:35:33] <Hydragyrum> I actually do use my ssh
[15:49:14] <fnk> well the public-known ip ranges for larger datacenters are constantly scanned, especially for ssh ports
[15:49:20] <fnk> but usually nothing to worry about
[16:31:04] <Joanna> Is there a way to whitelist certain addresses and reject strange or spoofed ip addresses?

[18:06:21] <fnk> Joanna: there is, using e.g. iptables
[18:06:48] <fnk> and/or you could implement port-knocking
[18:07:19] <fnk> but usually restricting ssh authentication to keys only and using a strong key is enough
[18:07:54] <fnk> i usually do not allow direct root logins via ssh (neither with password nor keys)
[18:08:12] <fnk> and specify allowed users in AllowUsers directive of sshd_config
[18:08:27] <iz> same, that's my setup, no root login via ssh and no password logins via ssh
[18:09:35] <iz> i didn't do specifically allowed users, but that's a nice extra safety net too, just in case someone manages to add an account with authorized_keys somehow
[18:10:31] <fnk> yeah it is not necessary, i just set it up like that in my provisioning scripts a few years ago 
[18:10:51] <fnk> if someone manages to add a new system account somehow, then i guess AllowUsers wouldn't help anyway :D
[18:11:11] <iz> yeah, it's a good idea though, i might do that on my server system
[18:11:23] <iz> yeah but if they manage to do that, you have bigger problems

[21:48:48] <jan6> instead of allowed users, you could also use ssh's CA signing feature, where you use a key to sign other keys, and ONLY the keys signed by the "CA" are allowed ;P
[21:50:08] <jan6> so unless the baddie manages to get ahold of your key, they can't even add or remove valid keys
