[14:49:32] <fanhako> Hi, in E2EE, how does the sender view unencrypted sent message ? Event If I switch device on whatsapp, I can see see previously sent message. In public key cryptography, isn't the receiver only the sole party able to decrypt the message because he is the only one having the matching private key ?
[14:52:03] <raelepei> Is it possible there are typos in your question? In particular I am confused that you ask to "view unencrypted sent message".
[14:52:14] <raelepei> Well, if it's unencrypted, then everyone can just view it, right?
[14:53:37] *** Quits: Elzington (~Elzington@68.235.43.12) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[14:53:50] <fanhako> sorry, english is my third language. What I mean is when I send a message to Bob, I use Bob's public key to encrypt the message. Then how can I still see the sent message unencrypted on my device ?
[14:55:41] <snappy> if i understand correctly, you're wondering why an app like whatsapp has a history of your sent messages, it is because the message is saved unencrypted before sending and encrypting to bob
[14:55:50] <astrocat> Because you don't need to decrypt it
[14:56:26] <raelepei> What if the sender can have multiple independent devices? I think Matrix also makes the messages decryptable by the client.
[14:56:50] <fanhako> ah, I see. It is stored plaintext on their server then ? Because If I link multiple devices, I can still see the history
[14:57:02] <ms7821> you could clearly just include yourself as a recipient
[14:57:29] <ms7821> but the way whatsapp works is it stores messages locally in a DB, and then makes encrypted backups that you can restore

[14:57:45] <ms7821> I think they've just released a better form of encrypting backups but I don't know the details
[14:58:40] <ms7821> have a look at https://blog.group-ib.com/whatsapp_forensic_artifacts
[14:58:57] <raelepei> "It is stored plaintext on their server" → That would defy the entire (and only) point of E2EE.
[14:59:18] <ms7821> fanhako, how do you link multiple devices on whatsapp?
[14:59:48] <ms7821> oh huh a new feature, I see
[15:00:22] <snappy> i think the way multi-device whatsapp works, is that it copies the message history from the primary device after setup (which sets up the keys)
[15:00:33] <ms7821> there's a paper at https://www.whatsapp.com/security/WhatsApp_Security_Whitepaper_v4_Preview.pdf
[15:00:39] <astrocat> Is that new feature out yet? last I heard it was under dev
[15:00:48] <ms7821> seems to be in beta
[15:01:33] <ms7821> search the paper for "companion device"
[15:01:51] <fanhako> raelepei, thanks that's informative. snappy, that makes sense
[15:03:40] <ms7821> it looks like companion devices are just added as additional recipients, validated by data uploaded when registering the companion device
[15:03:51] <fanhako> actually, I'm looking for a solution to send encrypted data to a server and being able to read it latter. Alice send an encrypted form, Bob decrypt and update the data, Alice consult the updated form.

[17:10:23] <wasamasa> MacGyver: ah, that makes more sense
[17:12:00] <raelepei> I'm aware that resisting a firehose of random data requires dedicated infrastructure, but that's not what I'm asking about.
[17:12:30] <raelepei> I just want to resist a small attacker with a GPU and a medium internet connection.
[17:14:03] <raelepei> Take physical security for example. I'm saying "I want protection from burglars in my home." and the response is "Well, you gotta involve a security company, 24/7 surveillance, armed guards, and deep pits around your facility!" … although I just want to install a lock on the door.
[17:14:54] <yawkat> well, and cloudflare has the same problem, and the only solutions they could come up with were captchas and TPMs
[17:16:33] <woggle> I think the tradeoff of PoW-based schemes for DOS prevention is usually incredibly poor because it's likely that attackers are willing to spend orders of magnitude more resources than your legit users.
[17:16:56] <yawkat> and using cloudflare *is* the lock on the door. it is much easier to just do a network-level attack that cloudflare can prevent, than it is to do an attack through something protocol-specific.
[17:19:27] <woggle> (And I think you're running into that "attacker has a lot more resources than legit users" issue given that you're concerned about mobile clients.)

[17:42:41] <ldm> Is the concept of "perfect correctness" the same as "perfect secrecy" by another name?
[17:43:40] <yawkat> correctness usually means that an algorithm will do what you expect when you use it non-maliciously. perfect correctness presumably means this holds in all cases
[17:43:57] <yawkat> eg correctness is dec(k, enc(k, m)) == m
[17:44:43] *** Quits: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[17:44:52] <ldm> Ah okay - so not the same as "perfect secrecy" (complete indistinguishability etc)
[17:46:15] <ldm> What's the use of a perfectly correct encryption scheme? Are there some attacks that can be done by making an opponent  decrypt a message that wasn't encrypted with the same key?

[18:05:41] <ldm> yawkat: I can find many references to "correct" encryption schemes, but I can't find "perfect correctness" in use anywhere outside of the NTRU post-quantum submission
[18:06:41] <yawkat> well, if i remember my pqcrypto course correctly, some of those algorithms lack 100% correctness.
[18:07:01] <yawkat> so being explicit may be more relevant in that context.
[18:07:46] <snappy> i'd hope pqrsa is correct
[18:07:54] <snappy> since it's just rsa
[18:08:22] <yawkat> ldm: yea, just checked the lecture slides, the original LWE isnt perfectly correct
[18:08:44] <yawkat> ldm: https://s.yawk.at/auKMUZUc
[18:09:59] <ldm> ah okay so their use of "perfect" is to reinforce that it's been proven correct?
[18:10:45] <yawkat> well the original LWE is also proven correct most of the time.
[18:11:27] <yawkat> i guess the "perfect" just means theres no unlucky cases where you have to retry.
