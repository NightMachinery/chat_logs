[01:13:21] <KillAnimals> Hey. Is it weird that a get url would work in my browser, but then I copy it in devtools to a curl command, it gives me a 403 forbidden?
[01:13:47] <bagder> weird maybe, but not too uncommon
[01:13:59] <KillAnimals> okay so it does happen.
[01:14:13] <bagder> that's usually the server checking the user-agent
[01:14:45] <KillAnimals> bagder: okay thats what I thought. I'm a bit confused though because I included the user agent header in the curl command
[01:16:02] <KillAnimals> Should that be sufficient? Or is the server able to determine that I am effectively spoofing?
[01:16:25] <bagder> hard to tell without a lot of more info and research
[01:16:49] <KillAnimals> I can reproduce the steps. Its very straigtforward. 
[01:17:37] <KillAnimals> Step 1 - Go here in the browser: https://sbplay.org/play/0t689fl5boy8?auto=0&referer=# 
[01:17:53] <KillAnimals> Step 2 - In the console, type: "let f = jwplayer().getPlaylist()[0].file; f;"
[01:18:22] <KillAnimals> That should return an url for a ".m3u8" file. 
[01:18:58] <KillAnimals> Step 3 - open up dev-tools, and paste the url that you just received.

[01:20:00] <KillAnimals> Step 4 - Under Network, Copy the link as cUrl. 
[01:20:41] <KillAnimals> Step 5 - Place the cUrl in bash, and receive a `<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>`  response
[01:21:38] <KillAnimals> The main issue again, being that it otherwise works from the browser, however when converted into a cUrl command, it is forbidden.
[01:31:40] <bagder> does the command line involve cookies?
[01:32:33] <KillAnimals> bagder: I didnt see any cookies, but maybe my devtools doesnt mention them.
[01:33:04] <bagder> they would be in the curl command line from copy-as-curl if so
[01:34:20] <KillAnimals> curl 'https://delivery141.akamai-cdn-content.com/hls2/01/00385/0t689fl5boy8_,n,h,.urlset/master.m3u8?t=_4z7P_f9q6JbBhRdisaalXkQKOvYQi1tnIW3xu8PnJc&s=1644996925&e=21600&f=1927985&srv=sto009&client=96.55.252.151' \

[01:34:26] <KillAnimals> oops sorry
[01:34:47] <KillAnimals> Well there it is. Was trying to get a pastebin ready
[01:35:28] <bagder> are all the query parameters in that URL "fixed" or do they change if you repeat the procedure?
[01:35:50] <bagder> they look like they might be some sort of session
[01:36:59] <KillAnimals> They vary

[01:41:51] <KillAnimals> Hm... I did the curl request without using -A , and instead putting it in manually. I wonder if that would change anything.

[19:27:02] <bagder> ok, summary of the azure issues: something in our CI jobs triggers MS's cryptominer-detector that auto-closes our access
[19:27:27] <bagder> I've now assisted them in maybe a way to better track down what it might be

[19:33:55] <Piru> fuzzing...
[19:34:10] <Piru> I guess they detect cpu usage over time or something
[19:34:31] <Piru> compiling usually has some sensible cpu usage / I/O ratio..
[19:34:59] <bagder> I know how they do it, but since they rather not have that made public I want to respect that and not talk about it here
[19:35:00] <Piru> if I'd have to guess it my guess would be fuzzing.
[19:35:12] <Piru> definitely don't :D
[19:35:45] <bagder> the main point here is that they see it happen but we haven't figured out what makes it happen
[19:35:53] <gevaerts> Well, cryptomining is fuzzing, isn't it? As in, try random things to see if some weird condition is met :)
[19:36:05] <bagder> it looks like a tainted ubuntu package to me
[19:36:07] <Piru> bagder: can't they map the timestamp somehow?
[19:36:22] <bagder> it started without any change from us
[19:36:46] <Piru> but I'm sure you can't go into much detail about this. it's understandable
[19:37:45] <Piru> if they have some kind of whitelist for good known debs then maybe taking some different ubuntu version might help. dunno

[19:39:01] <Piru> one thing we could do is taking a copy of the current CI solution and then doing a binary search by disabling parts of it. assuming it triggers reliably
[19:39:30] <Piru> by eliminating parts of the systematically we should be able to find out what triggers it

[19:39:35] <bagder> yes, I helped them to a set of builds without the issue
[19:39:56] <bagder> they can then basically work out the diff and bisect
[19:40:23] <Piru> ok good they should be able to find it then
[19:41:39] <bagder> yes, but it sounded like their tools for this are a bit crude still so not the smoothest operation
