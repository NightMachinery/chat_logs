[07:34:08] <webchat51> Hello. I am trying to fix audio not playing from Firefox on Ubuntu 18.04.  I can't pinpoint exactly when it started, but I have tried restarting alsa, pulseaudio, Firefox, and rebooting the machine.
[07:34:39] <webchat51> I can play and hear audio from other programs just fine. My next idea was to try reinstalling pulse, and then alsa if that didn't work, but is that going too far?

[08:59:44] <Guest75> hey, same Firefox/audio issue guy here.  Just following up for my own closure.  I finally traced down the issue. I use sxhkd for hotkeys with a launcher script, eg super+o;f launches Firefox.
[09:01:51] <Guest75>  I logged the env variables from a properly working program and diff'd with Firefox, and there was an error. XDG_RUNTIME_DIR was an invalid directory. It wasn't with the sxhkd config or the launcher script, but a typo in the script that sets up my keyboard layout at log in, so sxhkd and everything it runs inherited invalid env values.
[09:02:39] *** Quits: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.224) (Quit: Haxxa flies away.)
[09:02:56] <Guest75> It's all working now. Thank you for your help and the test user idea. I think I'll leave it there for troubleshooting purposes in the future.

[11:43:13] <Guest4> Not sure how should I lay it or where to post this but... There's something philosophically not well supported wrt Japanese input support in GNU/Linux, that current input i18n assumes 1) "base" keyboard layout is always ANSI, and 2) switching language switches layout.
[11:43:19] <Guest4> Japansese users don't do that, we assume 1) base is what's on keycaps, 2) switching language switches on/off/between IM((none), Mozc, Fcitx, ...).
[11:43:26] <Guest4> There are tons of posts online that discuss "fix" for a "wrong" layout "back" to jp106, evidences to follow. Even without extensive Japanese proficiency, just by looking at screenshots and filenames, you can probably see they're making multiple post-install changes that they are not supposed to have to make. This has been going years and not a
[11:43:26] <Guest4> recent issue or regression.
[11:43:31] <Guest4> https://qiita.com/spumoni/items/f1e5023829c575af4dd0 https://yuis-programming.com/?p=1633 https://forums.ubuntulinux.jp/viewtopic.php?pid=112097 https://golang.hateblo.jp/entry/ubuntu-keyboard-layout https://what-a-day.net/vm-keyboard-layout https://kokufu.blogspot.com/2019/05/ubuntu-1804.html
[11:43:37] <Guest4> Ubuntu(or any desktop GNU/Linux) shouldn't have immediate post-install fixes applied to /usr/share/ and /etc/default/ just to daily drive it - isn't that so? And I think this comes from the Japanese assumption I mentioned above, that are not well communicated/documented/recognized outside Japanosphere.
[11:43:44] <Guest4> Windows 10/11 uses similar system to current GNOME but built so keyboard layout can be choosed semi independent to input language, on top of having a "Hardware Layout" configurtion item in stock Japanese IME. So a near term fix for Ubuntu would be to 1) allow system-wide layout to be set to any keymap, 2) add bunch of layouts to US English in GNOME
[11:43:45] <Guest4> GUI.
[11:43:52] <Guest4> These fixes I proposed above are behaviors of GNU/Linux in the past that were phased out in favor of "base is ANSI, language layouts are available" model. But in long term the "base is always hardware, IM based conversions are available" model needs to be documented & noted.
[11:44:09] <Guest4> What I'm still not sure is what ... should I do? I can advocate this here all day and annoy people but that's just trolling, but I don't have time and ability to magically push Japanese specific fixes into the whole universe either.
[11:44:31] <Guest4> I'd appreciate if anyone has a right lead on the issue... TIA.

[13:09:52] <Seveas> does iptables -L -t nat -v show hits for that rule? And does tcpdump show the traffic? Is REDIRECT enough or dou you need DNAT?

[13:13:24] <ilmais1n_> okay, i'll find a totally different way of doing this
[13:13:45] <Seveas> THere are 2 types of nat: destination nat or source nat. aka dnat and snat. In this case you want -j DNAT --to-destination localhost:5222 instead of -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5222
[13:13:56] <Seveas> REDIRECT does not do what you want in this case
[13:14:21] <ilmais1n_> okay

[13:18:07] <Seveas> ilmais1n_: correct-ish. If you do `iptables -s foo.bar.com ...` it will do a hostname lookup for you and `iptables -L` can do reverse lookups, but its internal state does not use hsotnames, only ip addresses.

[14:56:48] <Blank_> okay well here's the problem
[14:56:55] <Blank_> [I use Zorin os its just a fancy KDE version of Ubuntu i guess but still Ubuntu] i have 2 GPUs listed below when i installed Zorin the first time (the first option "Try or Install Zorin OS") the screens worked fine, but after the install finished Zorin would boot up but when the desktop was supposed to show up it give a black screen with nothing on just the main monitor and the rest werent even reciveing a signal so i turned off my pc
[14:56:55] <Blank_> and turned it back on and then my BOIS wouldnt boot so i had to reset the BOIS to try again, after trying it a few more times even leaving on overnight it gave me the same results.
[14:56:55] <Blank_> SO the the 2nd install i used the "Try or Install Zorin OS (modern NVIDIA Drivers)" and well at OS install it showed all my screen as 1 big screen on my monitor (joined screens in display settings) and i thought its fine i will just change  it later when i am done installing, so it installs and everything comes on it is still one big screen so i let Zorin update before i do anything  and after that i checked the "Additional Drivers"
[14:56:55] <Blank_> (Image attached in link below) and the latest driver was selected and only 1 GPU (i am not sure if this is right and if not how to fix it) so i went to settings clicked on single displays and apply and "KEEP SETTINGS" if always reverts to "Joined Displays" so i googled it and they say i need to open Nvidia-Settings  and enable my monitor there so i did that and Nvidia-Settings always said it cant save/apply the settings (look at
[14:56:56] <Blank_> screenshot linked below) so i googled this problem too and they say just open it with on terminal as SUDO and save Config file in Nvidia-Settings, so i did that, now my 2nd monitor is working now but it doesn't show up in Display settings (another link to this screenshot below) and i cant find the answer via google can you maybe help me out?

[17:51:32] <waveform> geeky, that's probably something separate (the fkms workaround has been entirely solid so far in our tests). I'd hazard a guess that because firefox is now a snap it may be refreshing itself on the first boot (I certainly found that, when testing on an SD card, firefox disappeared entirely from the applications menu shortly after the first boot and then re-appeared when the snap had refreshed, but that took several minutes)

[23:10:30] <Umeaboy> I click to edit a song and I can't erase on the title field.
[23:11:26] <sarnold> are you sure that field is supposed to be editable in whatever program you're using?
