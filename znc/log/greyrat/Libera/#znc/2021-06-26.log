[03:12:09] <Stealth> hey
[03:12:21] <abff> hoy
[03:12:43] <Stealth> znc replays back private messages when disconnected
[03:13:01] <Stealth> any way to set up this for channels? any specific modules?
[03:13:11] <Stealth> say, the last 300 lines for each
[03:15:51] <MetaNova> Stealth: each channel can have a different buffer size
[03:16:05] <MetaNova> in webadmin, Your Settings -> Edit network -> Edit channel
[03:16:12] <Stealth> that's cool, and by default it's turned off?
[03:16:12] <abff> you mean like when znc disconnects from the server or you part a channel?
[03:16:23] <Stealth> no, when I disconnect znc
[03:16:53] <MetaNova> or: /msg *controlpanel setchan BufferSize $me $network #channel 500
[03:16:55] <Stealth> and want to catch up on what was while I was disconnected
[03:17:27] <Stealth> MetaNova: so by default it's turned off?
[03:17:40] <MetaNova> if you change the buffer size for your user, all channel buffer sizes will inherit it (and thus reflect the change) unless you have set your own buffer size manually before
[03:17:53] <MetaNova> this can be reversed by parting and rejoining the channel, I think
[03:18:08] <MetaNova> Stealth: is what turned off? buffered activity?
[03:18:13] <MetaNova> no
[03:18:44] <MetaNova> out of the box ZNC will cache playback when there are no clients connected
[03:20:52] <Stealth> I wonder if it has something to do with AutoClearQueryBuffer & AutoClearChanBuffer set to true
[03:21:49] <r00tobo> Stealth: that setting is after playback
[03:21:57] <Stealth> oh I see
[03:22:01] <abff> are you using multiple clients?
[03:22:09] <Stealth> yeah
[03:22:18] <abff> you neee clientbuffer module
[03:22:52] <r00tobo> https://wiki.znc.in/Clientbuffer
[03:22:59] <Stealth> yeah I'm already there
[03:24:13] <Stealth> let me check that..
[03:24:27] *** Joins: nod (~stealth@sourcemage/archon/stealth)
[03:24:33] <r00tobo> does clientbuffer clear the buffer for that specific identifier/client after playback ?
[03:25:14] <r00tobo> I don't use it myself but I want to see if it does or not 
[03:25:28] <r00tobo> or rather know 
[03:25:34] <abff> r00tobo: I believe if you have autoclear enabled it does not function properly
[03:25:58] <abff> and I don't think it does any clearing of its own
[03:26:06] <abff> but I am not certain of that
[03:26:55] <Stealth> alright, it seems I found out what the issue was
[03:27:59] <Stealth> I was connecting from 2 different laptops under to the same client, but I guess I don't have to have different identifiers for that
[03:28:18] <Stealth> s:under ::
[03:28:40] <Stealth> so it works as expected
[03:29:14] <abff> aye
[03:29:36] <Stealth> it's just I don't see replay when my other laptop is connected
[03:29:47] <Stealth> thanks all
[03:35:22] *** Quits: nod (~stealth@sourcemage/archon/stealth) (Quit: Dont wait to die to find paradise...)
[03:36:50] <abff> Stealth you need to manually add client identifiers, or start clientbuffer in auto mode (idr the arg)
[03:37:19] <gothkat> How does it figure out one client from another in auto mode? 
[03:37:39] <gothkat> i assume you still need to put in something unique on the client side?
[03:40:03] <Khaytsus> auto mode?  wut?  just specify the clientid in your connection
[03:41:55] <Stealth> yeah I guess all the info I need is here: https://wiki.znc.in/Clientbuffer#Identifiers

[03:42:37] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_Clients

I have also installed znc-clientbuffer from edge/testing repository. On the ZNC web admin, I don't see clientbuffer module listed to be enabled. Is there an alternative way of doing this in my case?

[23:28:20] <Ramses> so is there a problem with mirc and change/add user modes through znc?
[23:28:36] *** jkl is now known as jkl1337
[23:29:37] <MetaNova> Ramses: no, there shouldn't be
[23:29:39] <Ramses> that is using multinetworks. irssi 1.2.3 does work as it uses $N in modes to check net
[23:29:59] <MetaNova> Ramses: best to set desired user modes through perform
[23:30:06] <MetaNova> /msg *status loadmod --type=network perform
[23:30:16] <MetaNova> /msg *perform add mode %nick% +iw
[23:30:23] <MetaNova> (change +iw to your desired modes)
[23:30:30] <Ramses> nah, i mean me to +v someone like in chat only
[23:30:43] <Ramses> perhaps a mirc issue then
[23:30:44] *** jkl1337 is now known as jkl
[23:30:51] <MetaNova> ZNC doesn't get in the way of you doing /mode nick +v
[23:30:59] <MetaNova> er
[23:31:03] <Ramses> aight
[23:31:06] <MetaNova> /mode +v nick
[23:31:12] <MetaNova> or /mode #channel +v nick
[23:31:15] <Ramses> yup
[23:31:18] <Ramses> that works

[23:31:36] <Ramses> not using menue
[23:31:53] <Ramses> the right click and choose option
[23:32:20] <MetaNova> if a menu option doesn't do what it's supposed to that's solidly a client issue, especially if /mode works
[23:32:43] <Ramses> irssi just works /voice nick
[23:32:49] <Ramses> yup
[23:32:51] <Ramses> thanks
