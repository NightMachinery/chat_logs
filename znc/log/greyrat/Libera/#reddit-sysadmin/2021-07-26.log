[03:34:26] <JollyRgrs> @Colour Wireguard is not a true VPN... it is ez to setup and works well in many situations, but Wireguard != VPN

[03:36:57] <JollyRgrs> to clarify, it is technically a VPN... but doesn't offer everything you normally think of

[03:37:28] <JollyRgrs> https://cybernews.com/what-is-vpn/wireguard-protocol/ this one has a decent layout of the pros/cons of wireguard. see that it mentions wireguard won't let you get around the great firewall of china (by itself at least)
[03:37:45] <Rpifan> Sad about wireguard 
[03:38:31] <JollyRgrs> why?
[03:39:37] <JollyRgrs> it actually is much better for me than openvpn for use on my android. biggest thing is, when I VPN, i want DNS to use my DNS at home as well... but with a non-rooted android, it does ipv6 DNS before IPv4 DNS, and it'll still use VZW DNS even when i'm on openVPN with it set to 10.0.0.1 for DNS
[03:39:43] <JollyRgrs> wireguard? works like a champ

[21:26:36] <csws> oxipital, does the router just DHCP to get its IP? might need to spoof the MAC if the ISP is shitty

[21:26:39] <sd> 08<S‚Äãubaru(Alcyone)> but they're so expensive
[21:26:42] <csws> but otherwise it'd be plug and play probably
[21:26:53] <A-KO> yes. If you're small and can't negotiate the pricing, then yes--you're paying full price
[21:26:54] <A-KO> that's how it works

[21:27:04] <oxipital> csws: its static
[21:27:35] <oxipital> and ties in to the main mfd via another fiber connect
[21:27:47] <csws> yeah well I'd configure the other router with the details then swap it after business hours or something
[21:27:54] <A-KO> oh, also, you pay for the OEM license, too, FYI. (Yes, Microsoft double dips)

[22:51:03] <MoonBounce> How dangerous is it to make a MDT deployment zero touch and able to join the domain?
[22:51:27] <sintax> when we used MDT at my last place. you just started it off with a pxe boot and let it go
[22:51:37] <sintax> auto signed in with a 'domain user' account that was used. 
[22:52:00] <MoonBounce> yeah, i wanna make it so automatically joins the domain, but my security team is afraid that it'll allow anyone to plug in their laptop and join the domain
[22:52:18] <CptLuxx> i wonder if the default policy is changed
[22:52:22] <sintax> We turned the ethernet ports off when not in use. 
[22:52:25] <CptLuxx> by default anyone can add pcs to the domain
[22:52:26] <CptLuxx> :D
[22:52:35] <sintax> so a level 1 had to ask to have said port turned on. they turned off every night at midnight. 
[22:52:37] <MoonBounce> yeah, but you have to technically sitll sign in

[22:53:01] <sd> 12<f‚Äãelda> It has some munchin cats, but mostly it is kittens
[22:53:09] <sintax> so i get security looking at that way. or lock down the domain user account you want to use so it can't do anything once the image is done
[22:53:33] <MoonBounce> the other problem is sometimes we need to have users image stuff cause they are in a remote office
[22:53:37] <MoonBounce> with no it people
[22:53:45] <MoonBounce> if we require domain admin to image it aint gonna work
[22:54:17] <sintax> we don't need domain admin. 
[22:54:23] <sintax> just a regular user. 
[22:54:44] <sintax> ours is set up with a generic account now and can image anywhere with a ethernet connection at any offices. 
[22:54:51] <MoonBounce> ah, so you have it so a domain user can login to the winPE wizard?
[22:54:53] <sintax> but you can't do anything on the user account it creates
[22:55:40] <sintax> MoonBounce: when we do it remotely it will use the applications security group i believe and image it. the 'user' we use is a generic account that can't do anything. just enough to domain join the machine. 
[22:56:34] <PublicWiFi> ive got a group in my AD I made for "domain joiners", so I use a user account that's added to that
[22:56:36] <MoonBounce> makes sense... that definitely gives me some good ideas, thanks

[23:48:36] <oxipital> fucking bandaids
[23:48:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> vinrock ugh that sucks
[23:48:37] <vinrock> waiting for the ecu's to arrive
[23:48:51] <oxipital> so ive heard
[23:48:53] <estranger> man i wanna get off work so i can setup the sonos stuff
[23:48:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> I ordered a 2021 Tundra TRD Sport Preium
[23:49:00] <vinrock> what did you get
[23:49:02] <oxipital> we need to invest in chip fab
[23:49:03] <vinrock> ooooh nice
[23:49:07] <vinrock> great truck
[23:49:11] <AnonymooseReddtr> BUT i don't know if i will get it
[23:49:15] <vinrock> aw damn
[23:49:22] <estranger> Beam (sound bar) and 2 more One speakers, so i can get 5.1 on the tv
[23:49:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> Bro in law said Toyoyta might deny the order becuase of the 2022 launch
[23:49:26] <vinrock> nice
[23:49:29] <estranger> my visio soundbar is trash
[23:49:40] <estranger> but that was $99
[23:49:55] <vinrock> oh shit i didnt know they finally came out with a new tundra
[23:49:56] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> I like Android Auto better than Car Play
[23:50:03] <estranger> i couldnt justify getting the Arc soundbar for $900
[23:50:10] <vinrock> look at th shnoz on that thing
[23:50:13] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Somehow Apple designed a horrible UI for Car Play
[23:50:15] <AnonymooseReddtr> vinrock its "coming soon"
[23:50:32] <vinrock> i tink i remember hearing that the beam was amazeballs for its size
[23:50:50] <estranger> the reviews are really good and pairing up two more speakers to it, i think it will be good
[23:50:51] <signofzeta> Does anyone have experiencing scripting the output of the DIG command?  I'm using "dig -t TXT selector._domainkey.client.com" and it's returning two results, one for the CNAME record and one for the content of the TXT record.  Is there a quick way to get only the latter?
[23:51:07] <estranger> sonos's all sound pretty good

[23:52:22] <oxipital> signofzeta: throw the result in to a powershell object.
[23:52:43] <oxipital> but if youre on winders ps has a resolve-dnsname for you
[23:53:49] <oxipital> if its linux oir something maybe through head
[23:53:55] * oxipital looked that up

[23:54:20] <signofzeta> Yes, I use Resolve-DnsName on Windows.  I tried to write my own for macOS/Linux that wraps around dig.
[23:54:33] <oxipital> check that link
[23:54:39] <oxipital> seems similar to what you want
[23:54:54] <signofzeta> Yeah, some sed trickery might be needed.
[23:54:57] <signofzeta> Thanks!
[23:55:02] <oxipital> head -1 
[23:55:07] * oxipital shrugs
[23:55:13] <oxipital> sed is the devils tool

[23:56:23] <signofzeta> f I do "dig -t TXT +short selector1._domainkey.contoso.com", I get two responses:  line 1 is "selector1-contoso-com._domainkey.contoso.onmicrosoft.com" and line 2 is the Exchange Online DKIM record.
[23:56:33] <sd> 11<c‚Äãhicken lit tool> Boss insists that whatever he sees in Windows event viewer at roughly the same time as a shibboleth idp (technically it was the apache velocity platform inside the idp) error occured will be the reason it occurred
[23:56:34] <signofzeta> Since I'm only looking up DKIM records, I'll just filter out the first one.

[23:59:31] <oxipital> i miss mailing lists
