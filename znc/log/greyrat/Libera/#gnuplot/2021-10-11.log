[05:35:14] <Wax> Hi all, I'm trying to do something seemingly simple, but running into trouble. Basically I have a few numeric data points in a single column CSV file. These points fall into some categories of arbitrary size and I'd like to make a stacked histogram where e.g. data points 1-3 are stacked in a column, data points 4-5 are in another, etc. The data set is under 10 points, so I'm not opposed to things that wouldn't scale. How should I
[05:35:15] <Wax>  be going about this?

[14:38:21] <mnhrdt> i don't understand your question, do you want a histogram with arbitrary bins?
[14:38:53] <mnhrdt> or a separate histogram for each clategory?
