[00:18:47] <yuri6037> now I get error  -541478725 when calling av_read_frame
[00:19:03] <yuri6037> and that error is not documented
[00:20:13] <yuri6037> and still no frame read just a different error
[00:22:01] <yuri6037> of course in the example C files there's no mentions of such an error code, does anyone know what's does this error mean?
[00:22:23] <BtbN> That's not a valid error code.
[00:23:22] <yuri6037> but that's what I get from av_read_frame if I call it in a loop to avoid EAGAIN in avcodec_receive_frame
[00:23:26] <BtbN> Use av_strerror/av_make_error_string if you want to get the string representation
[00:24:03] <BtbN> You either need to feed data until EAGAIN, then read a frame, and repeat
[00:24:11] <BtbN> or read frames until EAGAIN, then feed data, and repeat
[00:24:20] <BtbN> Or anything in between, if you feel like it
[00:24:46] <yuri6037> Actually I get EAGAIN instantly right after reading just one packet
[00:25:02] <BtbN> That's about expected
[00:25:22] <BtbN> if you get EAGAIN, it wants more input, or it wants you to read more output, depending on which side returns it
[00:25:57] <yuri6037> Yeah so in this case I have a loop which calls again and again av_read_frame until it stops complaining about EAGAIN

[00:31:00] <BtbN> Are you confusing avcodec_receive_frame and av_read_frame?
[00:31:08] <BtbN> av_read_frame reads from your file, until EOF
[00:31:12] <BtbN> so EOF is very epxected there

[01:25:36] <kepstin> you need to find out what your rust code expects the memory layout to look like, then pick an ffmpeg format that matches that
[01:25:40] <kepstin> we don't know what that is
[01:25:48] <yuri6037> I need RGB where R is a byte from 0 to 255, G 0-255 and B 0-255
[01:26:07] <BtbN> And in what layout?
[01:26:08] <kepstin> yes, but how is that laid out in memory?

[01:26:33] <yuri6037> out->r = buffer[(pos->y * stride) + pos->x];

[17:51:48] <SamHenderson> Hello ... I tried to build ffmpeg using --enabled-shared in the configure flags but it resulted in a bunch of errors like:
[17:52:55] <mrcoffee> Ok, yes it worked
[17:52:56] <SamHenderson> https://pastebin.com/JkY20A26
[17:54:10] <SamHenderson> Basically, --enabled-shared resulted in errors telling me I need to recompile with -fPIC ...  ?    Do I just add that as a CFLAG or LFLAG?   I know when I compile code manually with gcc I usually put it immediately after gcc...
[17:54:56] <BtbN> You can only link position independent code into a shared library.
[17:55:13] <BtbN> So if you're trying to link static libraries into your shared library, it has to be position independent.
[17:55:19] <BtbN> i.e. recompile that libvpx with -fPIC
[17:55:36] <BtbN> And every single other library you want to link statically
[17:57:49] *** Quits: justache (~justache@user/justache) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:58:02] <SamHenderson> Ahhhh ... so all of the other libs need -fPIC as well?
[17:58:29] <BtbN> every single bit of code linked into a shared lib has to be position independent
[17:58:55] *** Joins: justache (~justache@user/justache)
[17:59:15] <SamHenderson> Well, I built every other library with --enable-shared   ... I guess that wasn't enough and -fPIC must be explicitly set?
[17:59:50] <BtbN> --enable-shared usually makes a build system produce shared libs. Not enable fPIC
[18:00:25] <SamHenderson> I see.  I kind of figured it was automatic.  My mistake.
[18:00:25] <BtbN> autotools will always make static libs non-PIC, and shared ones PIC, obviously
[18:00:46] <BtbN> So you'll need to hack around a bit to get non-standard PIC static libs
[18:01:01] <BtbN> libtool WILL strip -fPIC out of cflags if you just add it
[18:01:05] <BtbN> it's a lot of fun to deal with
[18:06:37] <SamHenderson> Yeah well I want shared PIC libs.  So what's the best way to hack around this?  I used the following build script: https://pastebin.com/C409brbp
[18:08:02] <BtbN> If you got docker, you can just use ghcr.io/btbn/ffmpeg-builds/linux64-gpl:latest
[18:09:01] <SamHenderson> I do not sadly

[18:18:16] <SamHenderson> Ah crap!  I didn't upload the most recent copy of my build script so libvpx was  built without --enable-shared so ... I guess that's why PIC wasn't there when ffmpeg tried to link against it ...
