[00:28:57] <vigoux[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright): are you enjoying it so far? 
[00:29:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think it's very good
[00:29:46] <vigoux[m]> No need for marketing when you have sunjon in your team
[00:30:43] <vigoux[m]> But yeah, I think I never enjoyed working with completion this much 
[00:30:54] <vigoux[m]> So I quite like this plugin in the end
[00:34:23] <sunjonSenghanBri> I wasn't going to plug it _too_ much, as there's lots of good completion plugins, and a few of their authors frequent here
[00:34:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> I do think it's highly likely that this is the one I will be settling on though
[00:36:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think it'll appeal to users of the original completion.nvim too (I feel they're similar, but your method of combining sources works, where completion.nvim's 'chain_complete' tended not to)

[07:57:21] <CraigRodrigues[m> (Sorry for the dumb question, I am new to lua, and am doing a lot of cut & paste)
[07:57:55] <sim[m]> You return a table from lua files

[07:58:34] <sim[m]> Then whenever you require that module you get that table back

[08:01:03] <sim[m]> Lua gang üí™
[08:01:10] <LordRishav> What are the benefits of just using Lua
[08:01:25] <sim[m]> s/LSP.lua/lsp/
[08:01:26] <windwp[m]> don't call rust-tool.setup on ftplugin/rust.lua in will call mutliple time
[08:02:02] <sim[m]> Yes, just call it anywhere in your init.lua and everything else would be taken care of
[08:02:21] <sim[m]> That ft stuff messes with the autocommands and stuff
[08:03:10] <CraigRodrigues[m> I started learning Rust about 1 month ago.  I watched a 3 year old Youtube video by Jon Gjengset where he walked through his neovim Rust setup.  I started with that which was a bunch of vimconf.  Then I started looking for better alaternatives and found simar39/rust-tools.nvim and loved it
[08:03:44] <CraigRodrigues[m> I'm also setting up ray-x/go.nvim , so that I can have a Go dev environment (I'm having away from fatih/vim-go, which I used for many years with vim)
[08:04:05] <sim[m]> Btw we use vim.ui.select now so if you want telescope for runnables you need to make the necessary changes 
[08:04:46] <CraigRodrigues[m> I was just getting a bit confused because I wanted to have a single on_attach function and pass to all lsp servers (gopls, rust_analyzer), and was getting a bit confused, because with simrat39/rust-tools.nvim, you have one layer of indirection on top of that
[08:05:19] <CraigRodrigues[m> but I am getting the hang of it, once I start looking at the Lua code. üòÄ
[08:05:37] <sim[m]> If you don't wanna mess around with modules them you can just move your rust tools setup to your lsp.lua file
[08:06:15] <CraigRodrigues[m> I thought of that, but I want to keep things modular

[08:21:24] <JieruMei[m]> I have some problem with neovim quickfix mode.
[08:21:28] <sim[m]> You don't have to require the same thing so many times 
[08:21:37] <JieruMei[m]> When I try the following `rg --hidden --glob '!.git' --no-heading --smart-case --vimgrep val | nvim -q /dev/stdin`
[08:21:53] <sim[m]> Define a local variable blah = require (whatever)
[08:21:56] <JieruMei[m]> It open the content in the buffer instead of the quickfix list.
[08:21:59] <sim[m]> Now blah has everything in it
[08:22:15] <sim[m]> Use it like blah.on_attach blah.other_table_key
[08:24:34] <CraigRodrigues[m> what happens if you call require('lsp').blah , require('lsp').foo .   Does it re-evaluate too many times?
[08:24:56] <sim[m]> No, it's cached I believe

[15:05:50] <clason[m]> if in doubt, `utf-16` (as per spec)
[15:06:15] <bluemonksr[m]> i tried 8, 16, and 32. complains for all.
[15:06:28] <muniter[m]> Not 100% sure, but I think you are just telling the servers you support the offset encoding protocol extension. Doesn't mean server is going to use it.
[15:06:30] <bfredl> so the problem is not with offsetEncoding, but elsewhere
[15:07:07] <clason[m]> yeah, you need to pass `offset_encoding` to the lspconfig setup
[15:07:10] <bluemonksr[m]> bluemonksr[m]: never mind, I had both utf-8 and 16 in default. changing only 16 helps it! thansk everyone

[15:28:42] <clason[m]> yes

[15:31:52] <clason[m]> you _are_ calling a vim function (`v:lua`), so you need to make sure that the _vimscript_ parser understands the call

[18:21:20] <fortran1312[m]> I'm trying to make rust_analyzer work. it doesnt. when I open a .rs file nvim tells me:"autostart for rust_analyzer failed: matching root directory not detected". clangd works fine tho. for clangd I just put require'lspconfig'.clangd.setup{} in my init.lua and that was it

[23:33:13] <saltrocklamp[m]> fair enough, still at least somewhat useful to people who aren't heavily involved
[23:34:18] <saltrocklamp[m]> maybe there should be a neovim "space" on matrix? to group channels together

[23:37:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> the newline chars get printed literally
[23:38:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> you could post that code to an issue and ask for further advice (unless someone here corrects it)
[23:38:18] <clason[m]> better on discourse

[23:38:34] <clason[m]> (issues are not for usage questions)
[23:39:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> well, splitting lines would be the primary use for the formatting function. I only mentioned issues because I at least expected that to work
[23:39:27] <clason[m]> but check https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/wiki/UI-Customization first
[23:40:03] <clason[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: no, that's not really what this is meant for -- it's more for adding a prefix or icon to the diagnostics
[23:40:06] <monkoosemonkoose> Ok, have implemented matchparein in lua (that respects treesitter comment and string captures), need to arrange it in a plugin now
[23:40:45] <clason[m]> the virtual text is not really suitable for showing full diagnostics; that's what `:h vim.diagnostic.open_float()` is for
[23:40:53] <sunjonSenghanBri> clason: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13860#issuecomment-927673827 I was going by that

[23:41:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> and the format function also prints literal '\n's when used in the float config
[23:41:35] <clason[m]> yes -- that just talks about trimming, not about slicing up into multiple lines
[23:41:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd kinda half guessed that it might need something extra for virt_text
[23:41:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> he used the word 'slice' :]
[23:42:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> a pedant would argue that's enough to raise expectations!
