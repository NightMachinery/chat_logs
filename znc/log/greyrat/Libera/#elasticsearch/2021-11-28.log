[14:28:21] <pycode> ...
[14:28:24] <pycode> anyone?
[14:40:39] <beorn_> That can't be the only error?
[14:41:51] <pycode> beorn_, 
[14:41:53] <pycode> the problem is
[14:42:01] <pycode> that i have running 5.6.3
[14:42:07] <pycode> i thought an error with indexes or something
[14:42:14] <pycode> so i have downloaded 5.6.16
[14:42:16] <pycode> unzippped
[14:42:43] <pycode> then ./elasticsearch and https://bpa.st/IBAA
[14:42:58] <pycode> so i get that problem with a new elasticsearch
[14:43:29] <beorn_> Normally you have to add a lot of environment variables and/or switches to the elasticsearch binary.
[14:43:42] <beorn_> There's no way to know what is going on in your environment.
[14:44:43] <pycode> https://bpa.st/R4MA
[14:45:11] <pycode> beorn_, what od you mean exactly? i am runnign elasticsearch without touching the config
[14:47:04] <pycode> just starting the deamon
[14:47:26] <pycode> maybe osmeone have updated the java i do not know 
[14:47:29] <pycode> it seems a java problem
[15:03:15] <beorn_> pycode: How does your new Elasticsearch know which config to use?
[15:03:56] <pycode> beorn_, i downloaded the .zip it has everything inside that zip there is a config folder
[15:04:10] <pycode> when i run ./elasticsearch it just works correctly
[15:04:36] <pycode> beorn_, the problem: https://bpa.st/FRIA
[15:04:47] <pycode> there is no mention about config file or something
[15:04:53] <pycode> there is a NUmberFormatException
[15:05:02] <beorn_> OK, good luck.
[15:05:03] <pycode> (line 22)
[15:05:07] <pycode> beorn_, ?
[15:05:58] <pycode> when i run locally it starts withput problem: https://bpa.st/75HA
[15:06:22] <beorn_> What do you mean "locally"?
[15:06:33] <pycode> beorn_, on my pc...the error is coming from a VPS
[15:06:41] <pycode> i downloaded the same zip
[15:06:45] <pycode> locally and from server
[15:06:56] <pycode> then locally i can start elasticsearch without problem and without touching anything
[15:07:06] <pycode> from the server...no i get the error i gave you
[15:07:45] <beorn_> Perhaps it's trying to reserve too much memory.
[15:08:28] <pycode> in server? where do you see the error about memory
[15:08:38] <pycode> and where that long is coming from
[15:08:42] <pycode> as i wrote i did not touch anything
[15:09:19] <beorn_> pycode: I have no idea what your environment is, what your config is, or anything. You just keep pasting the same error again and again. Since you don't give any useful information, all I can do is guess.
[15:09:57] <pycode> beorn_, i am not giving you other information because as i wrote, i am using ALL the default stuff of ElasticSearch
[15:10:04] <pycode> and i also give you the java/javac version
[15:10:09] <pycode> tell me what other info you need
[15:10:12] <beorn_> To find out why this fails with the new version, you should 1) find out what changed between the old and the new version, and 2) find out what is different between your PC and the VPN.
[15:10:16] <beorn_> VPS*.
[15:11:05] <pycode> beorn_, inside the elasticsearch-5.6.16/ folder nothing locally and vps are identically i have ran unzip ES_file.zip on both
[15:11:12] <pycode> nothing else
[15:11:16] <beorn_> You should also find out how to debug the elasticsearch startup process.
[15:11:19] <pycode> so for that reason i thought about a system error
[15:11:31] <beorn_> pycode: If you think it's a system error, contact your VPS provider.
[15:11:58] <pycode> just guessing because the config is the same
[15:12:01] <beorn_> pycode: Read the changelogs between 5.6.3 and 5.6.16
[15:12:33] <beorn_> pycode: There are lots of changes to Elastichsearch behaviour between versions. If something worked with 5.6.3, it's not guaranteed to work with 5.6.16.
[15:12:37] <pycode> beorn_, no the problem is just the same i thought there was an error with my indexes so for that reason i have downloaed a new fresh version of ES...but the error is the same...so the "data" is not the problem
[15:13:07] <beorn_> So where's your data? Which directory?
[15:13:44] <pycode> beorn_, when you use the deamon inside the zip, if also have a folder called data... so i have the /data inside my elasticsearch-5.6.3
[15:14:09] <pycode> same thing when i install 5.6.16 elasticsearch will use the /data folder inside 
[15:15:07] <beorn_> So you don't need the old data?
[15:15:58] <pycode> beorn_, yes surebut that's another problem as i wrote i tried a new fresh install to understand if the error is inside my data or not.....and it seems not because with a fresh install i get the same error
[15:16:14] <beorn_> What's your VPS specs?
[15:17:26] <pycode> Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS
[15:17:31] <pycode> 32GB Of ram
[15:17:42] <pycode> Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1231 v3 @ 3.40GHz
[15:18:00] <beorn_> And you haven't changed aything in jvm.options?
[15:18:19] <pycode> the default is 2g (Xms)
[15:18:22] <pycode> i tried with 8g
[15:18:23] <pycode> same problem
[15:18:29] <pycode> just those values
[15:18:32] <beorn_> Is 5.6.3 still running?
[15:18:36] <pycode> no
[15:18:53] <pycode> no elasticsaerch is running
[15:18:56] <pycode> i also rebooted
[15:20:18] <pycode> from both 5.6.3. and 5.6.16 i have the same cause >>> Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "18446744073709551615" <<<
[15:20:35] <pycode> i really do not understand from where that number is coming
[15:20:47] <beorn_> Have you tried googling it?
[15:21:53] <pycode> uhh yes i tried but did not find anything
[15:21:54] <pycode> https://bpa.st/LJRA
[15:22:00] <pycode> maybe try to reinstall java ?
[15:22:06] <pycode> idk i am desperated
[15:22:16] <beorn_> The number is 2^64-1
[15:22:26] <beorn_> Very strange that you didn't find it.
[15:22:51] <pycode> i find similar but not from startup... i mean.. i saw people got that error for queries..etc..
[15:22:54] <pycode> i cant start elastic
[15:25:11] <pycode> beorn_, https://bpa.st/6LQQ maybe because i have two ?
[15:25:27] <beorn_> No
[15:25:55] <beorn_> Has Elasticsearch ever worked on your VPS?
[15:25:57] <pycode> so do you think reinstalling java is not needed
[15:25:59] <pycode> sure
[15:26:01] <pycode> always
[15:26:17] <pycode> but i suppose someone ran apt dist-upgrade
[15:26:19] <beorn_> You just wrote that 5.6.3 also fails with the java.lang.NumberFormatException error?
[15:26:30] <pycode> and maybe another package is giving problems
[15:26:33] <pycode> yes
[15:26:35] <pycode> same problem
[15:26:49] <beorn_> The you should find out what has happened on your VPS.
[15:26:51] <pycode> 5.6.3 (always worked) and it has data
[15:26:59] <pycode> 5.6.16 is fresh with no data...but same error on both
[15:27:30] <pycode> beorn_, i am 100% anyone has installed new packages so the think could but apt dist-upgrade that's it
[15:27:35] <pycode> no other packages or something strange
[15:27:44] <pycode> but today we had a problem with network with our vps
[15:27:45] <beorn_> Well, something has changed and it's not elasticsearch.
[15:27:56] <beorn_> You are trying to fix something that's not the problem.
[15:28:09] <pycode> so after restart i tried to start elasticsaerch again but that that LONG exception
[15:28:21] <beorn_> Try starting it with verbose logging
[15:28:26] <pycode> beorn_, exaclty for that reason i thought there is not an elasticsaerch problem
[15:28:30] <pycode> beorn_, yeah i added a -v
[15:28:34] <pycode> but no more output
[15:29:10] <beorn_> OK. I can't help you then. Read the apt logs, ask your VPS provider.
[15:33:53] <pycode> :/
