[08:59:08] <Terminus> need a couple of nginx containers listening on port 80 and 443? just have them on different addresses.

[16:10:13] <isekaijin> (The main two reasons for wanting an image not to be displayed are that it could be too large, disrupting the ongoing conversation, or NSFW.)

[16:47:22] <zoidberg> I'm not sure. Christmas isn't that big of a deal here.
[16:47:28] <PancakeMatsuri> Matt|home have you heard of the Boxing day?

[17:17:56] <Sadale> all of them. They place ads on TV channels here begging for donation for helping those African people. Funny how an ad like that would cost thousands of dollars each of the time it gets broadcasted.

[17:20:03] <JesseDesu> cuz no one is watching
[17:20:09] <MootPoot> also, for a large organization that kind of money is pennies really
[17:20:20] <MootPoot> if you spend 20k on a ad and get 100k back, it was worth it
[17:20:21] <Sadale> They'd be like "please just donate $10 a month. It'd help this kid out of poverty!" You know what I'm thinking? Here's actually what'd happen: "please just donate $10 a month so that we could keep running this ad on this TV channel" xD
[17:20:49] <MootPoot> lol
[17:21:00] <listenurs> the food bank ceo won the nobel peace prize in 2021 or maybe it was previous year hes republican
[17:21:03] <Sadale> I mean the money could be better spent. TV ads are super expensive here. If they're placing TV ads, I defo won't donate to them even if I've got extra money at disposal.
[17:21:43] <MootPoot> how so? Do you know their internal balence sheets? Do you know their stats on how much benefit they get spending a TV ad vs elsewhere?

[17:24:02] <Sadale> The math is just off. I've noticed that this kind of ad would be run like everyday for several time. I estimate that it'd take 500k to run a ad campaign like that. If they're asking for $10 a month, they'd have to convince 4000 people to make subscription to break even after a year.
[17:24:08] <listenurs> you know hes right he really saying to tighten the plans on our future and not just hand out donations to inadequate plan
[17:24:38] <Sadale> And 4000 people is a lot.
[17:24:53] <listenurs> though it may be a real long time till those naturally come about i assume
[17:25:20] <MootPoot> Do you have any source for those numbers?
[17:25:25] <Sadale> oh. And not to mention that they run multiple ads campaigns.
[17:25:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just read up on the ads pricing on the TV broadcaster's website
[17:26:16] <MootPoot> then if it costs so much, why would they keep doing it?
[17:26:29] <MootPoot> Clearly because its worth it
[17:26:35] <listenurs> i wonder why schools dont use blinken too train memory
[17:27:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, That's what I actually find funny.
[17:27:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, I suspect that the main source of benefit comes from the bigger donators of the ultra rich, not from the people who made the $10/month contribution
[17:27:42] <Sadale> I can't prove that tho
[17:27:54] <MootPoot> conspiracy time
[17:29:40] <Jigsy> Is Somalian conspiracy different from regular conspiracy?
[17:30:08] <MootPoot> Everybody should just donate to the MootPoot consumerism fund
[17:30:53] <Sadale> Anyway even if there's a benefit, the main problem I have is that it's expensive af to put ads on TV. If I donate to them, I'd know that quite a bit of the money I donate would get eaten up by the TV channel. And those money won't end up being in the hands of the people in need.
