[14:31:31] <Carbonflux> been playing Control, good game, takes some getting used to, dying to much.
[14:32:02] <Juliu> Hi nerds
[14:32:11] <Carbonflux> lots of fun conspiracy theories in it heh
[14:32:27] <Juliu> Control looked like it would become pretty repetetive after a while
[14:32:36] <Carbonflux> ya, it is
[14:32:55] <Carbonflux> at least in terms of combat
[14:33:14] <Carbonflux> but i go back to it because of the story
[14:33:31] <Juliu> Have fun
[14:34:00] <jotham> good to see the dumbest person on IRC is back
[14:34:18] <Carbonflux> also the combat can be kinda fun, i found a floppy disk that lets me throw things telekinectically, thats kinda fun, you can use almost any object.
[14:34:31] <jotham> control looked fun
[14:34:41] <jotham> i can't really FPS because my nervous system is cooked
[14:34:54] <Carbonflux> good graphics as well
[14:35:30] <Carbonflux> heh i can understand that, i have to stop and be mindful in combat or i stress out and can't aim
[14:35:50] <Juliu> jotham, welcome back. But I'm not sure if it's really good to see you again
[14:36:07] <jotham> am watching Space sweepers, the mix of english and korean is a little disorienting
[14:36:19] <jotham> maybe i should watch it in cc so i read the english as well as the korean
[14:36:55] <Carbonflux> thats a great film imo, good CG and cyberpunk elements iirc.
[14:37:13] <jotham> yeah been meaning to watch it for a while
[14:37:15] <Juliu> Must be confusing if they speak Korean but you don't
[14:37:59] <jotham> that's why you watch movies with subtitles, like a normal person
[14:38:06] <Carbonflux> when i watched it showed sub-titles for the Korean part i seem too remember.
[14:38:13] <jotham> but switching from subtitles to verbal english is a new to me
[14:38:22] <jotham> yeah Carbonflux 
[14:38:26] <jotham> that's the bit i find new
[14:38:29] <Carbonflux> ah i see what you mean
[14:38:36] <jotham> the mix of english vocal and korean subtitle
[14:38:43] <jotham> might be better if it was all subtitle, even the english
[14:38:59] <jotham> i'm used to watching subtitles
[14:39:22] <jotham> also i think it's probably cool and i should get used to it and there should be more mixed language films
[14:39:35] <jotham> too bad i'm on call and have to fix something now
[14:39:41] <Carbonflux> ya, problem with CC is it does sounds and stuff which i find distracting.
[14:39:47] <jotham> same
[14:39:57] <jotham> [dramatic strings end]
[14:40:00] <jotham> calm down aye
[14:40:06] <jotham> i know it's for deaf people, so not useful for us
[14:40:19] <jotham> cc is a bit much for me
[14:40:52] <jotham> [american 4 makes grunting noise]
[14:40:59] <Raziel> even when I can understand the spoken language just fine I still like having subtitles on
[14:41:10] <Raziel> so when the only option is CCs, ye, it's a bit annoying
[14:41:12] <jotham> yeah as i've got older i've definitely leaned that way Raziel 
[14:41:33] <Carbonflux> ya agreed
[14:42:05] <Carbonflux> some movies have a big dynamic range as well, people talking in low voices and then the action scenes are really loud
[14:42:22] <Juliu> I like watching movies and series with dubs. Sure, some of the original jokes might not translate that well. But overall it's still a way more pleasant experience
[14:42:59] <jotham> can't stand dubs
[14:43:01] <jotham> has to be subs
[14:43:11] <Carbonflux> ya, i watch a lot of Chinese shows and can't stand the dubs.
[14:43:11] <jotham> so you get the emotion of the original language
[14:43:14] <Raziel> and thus, shitshow sunday begins
[14:43:16] <Raziel> :^)
[14:43:34] <jotham> god damn it Raziel 
[14:43:42] * jotham girds his loins
[14:44:29] <jotham> so much information is communicated in the native tongue that isn't specifically something you can understand as language so much as vocal body language
[14:44:33] <jotham> you can't dub something
[14:44:35] <jotham> sorry germany
[14:45:05] <Carbonflux> ya, also i find it really distracting when the lips don't match
[14:45:16] <jotham> yeah that's fucked
[14:45:40] <jotham> a huge amount of our processing is devoted to facial expression and affectation in the voice
[14:45:51] <jotham> just processing words isn't enough
[14:46:45] <jotham> even with the words alone, we argue about that at length
[14:47:22] <jotham> i just watched a danish movie and was constantly thinking, the danish people conquered my people, is there a language commonality here
[14:47:31] <jotham> i didn't really find much of one, but i'm not a linguist
[14:48:10] <Juliu> The original language is often way worse quality soundwise, since they recorded that language on set, and not in a studio like the dubs
[14:48:30] <jotham> https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1640680/ fairly rough
[14:48:44] <Renderwww> dubs are only okay for cartoons
[14:48:48] <Juliu> So it makes it especially hard to understand the dubs, since the language isn't yours, and the quality is worse
[14:48:51] <jotham> i'm sorry to inform you, you're autistic Juliu 
[14:48:57] <jotham> we had a quick meeting about it
[14:49:01] <jotham> and you absolutely are
[14:49:20] <Juliu> jotham, why would I care about your "informations" ? You already proved to not be the smartest
[14:49:28] <jotham> what are informations
[14:49:45] <Raziel> jotham, there are many highly intelligent and nice autistic people who would be highly offended at being compared to Juliu here, take that back
[14:49:50] <Raziel> :p
[14:49:54] <Juliu> The plural of information. And don't tell me that some people say that information doesn't have a plural. I disagree
[14:49:58] <jotham> Raziel: one of my best friends is one of those people
[14:50:06] <jotham> Raziel: there are also lots of people lost in the wilderness
[14:50:17] <Carbonflux> i think dubs can be ok for animation but sometimes the voice acting is not so good.
[14:50:21] <Juliu> Raziel, most autistic people are just dumb
[14:50:32] <Juliu> I watch all movies dubbed
[14:50:39] <jotham> i watched cowboy bebop in dubs and it was okay
[14:50:47] <jotham> gonna rewatch it now it's on netflix with subs
[14:50:51] <jotham> i regret every dub i see
[14:50:58] <jotham> it's a very dissonant experience
[14:51:02] <Juliu> jotham, the anime or the live action? Not sure if the live action is even out yet
[14:51:08] <jotham> anime
[14:51:16] <jotham> you answered your own question i think
[14:51:25] <Juliu> Maybe the dubs in your country are just bad
[14:51:31] <jotham> that'll be it
[14:51:41] <jotham> my country that is uniquely policed by a dubs law on the internet
[14:51:45] <jotham> 10/10 for imagination mate
[14:52:14] <Juliu> I did not answer my own question since it could be that the life action is already out and that you saw that one. Since a lot of idiots watch Netflix, and I think it's a Netflix production
[14:52:28] <jotham> you should write a livejournal entry about people that can't get the same dubs because of geopolitics but otherwise can pirate the same content
[14:52:29] <Juliu> life/live
[14:52:32] <jotham> sounds very clever
[14:53:00] <Raziel> you wouldn't download a voice actor
[14:53:08] <jotham> or shit in his helmet
[14:53:16] <jotham> (***nb voice actors now wear helmets)
[14:54:22] <Juliu> Heck, I even play dubbed videogames
[14:54:42] <jotham> this is just confirming you have no grasp of vocal emotion
[14:55:07] <Raziel> I played the ezio trilogy of asscreed with the italian dubs, for that authentic QUE CAZZO FAI experience
[14:55:27] <Juliu> Most dubs are good. Only the dubbed videogames from the 90s are sometimes bad ... yes, I am looking at you, Metal Gear Solid 1
[14:55:29] <jotham> makes it easier to understand why Juliu thinks everyone is dumb when he's only got 1/3 of our input data to work with
[14:55:32] <jotham> not his fault at all
[14:55:57] <Juliu> jotham, if you don't think that everyone is dumb, you are dumb
[14:56:09] <jotham> Juliu i too agree people might seem stupid if you can't recieve 66% of their messages

[14:56:47] <Carbonflux> i just finished Metro Exodus which afaik was originally in Russian but i did not notice any issues, the lip sync seemed good.
[14:56:53] <Juliu> Receiving 0% of their shit would be better
[14:56:58] <jotham> right
[14:57:07] <jotham> which is why that weird guy said to kill yourself
[14:57:10] <Juliu> Carbonflux, indeed

[14:57:33] <jotham> yeah Carbonflux that's the last fps i tried to play

[14:57:50] <Juliu> jotham, take less drugs
[14:57:56] <jotham> Raziel: agreed
[14:58:15] <jotham> Juliu: i didn't tell you to kill yourself, you said you want 0% input from other humans
[14:58:19] <jotham> you told yourself that
[14:58:27] <Juliu> jotham, I said 0% of their shit
[14:58:31] <jotham> that's why i was wondering if you were autistic
[14:58:38] <jotham> yeah but 'their shit' is a sieve in your mind
[14:58:41] <jotham> so they can't ever do that
[14:58:44] <jotham> they don't know your mind
[14:58:49] <Juliu> jotham, no, I am not autistic
[14:58:54] <jotham> you very much are
[14:59:00] <jotham> your country is just failing you on care
[14:59:24] <Juliu> jotham, no, I am not. I am just not interested in dumb people, the dumb things they say, and dumb ideas
[14:59:35] <jotham> right, 90% of all ideas are dumb
[14:59:46] <Juliu> My country is a socialist shithole anyway. Too many dumb people
[14:59:54] <jotham> your narrative is very clear, you're a good communicator
[15:00:01] <Juliu> Finally we agree on something
[15:00:04] <Carbonflux> there are no dumb people in their own frame of reference.
[15:00:06] <jotham> all you are communicating is that you hate people because you can't communicate
[15:00:24] <Juliu> I hate most people because they are hate-worthy
[15:00:31] <jotham> right
[15:00:41] <jotham> rather than your belief system is the lens you see people through
[15:00:46] <Juliu> Carbonflux, that's the problem!
[15:00:50] <jotham> and your belief system might need improvement
[15:01:09] <Juliu> jotham, I think people need improvement
[15:01:34] <jotham> right, but that's because of what you've received from your communication sources right
[15:01:46] <jotham> and i'm suggesting your ability to communicate is faulty
[15:01:53] <jotham> so your version of the world is a product of that
[15:02:07] <Carbonflux> part of the basis of rational compassion is realizing the relative nature of consciousness. 
[15:02:15] <jotham> we can't fault you for receiving bad data
[15:03:09] <jotham> you openly admit you don't want to exhibit compassion while receiving data which is a massive part of human data transfer
[15:03:19] <jotham> so your data is broken
[15:03:22] <Juliu> jotham, I suggest you are an idiot. So what now?
[15:03:33] <jotham> what i just said above
[15:03:51] <Raziel> you gotta settle this problem like responsible adults
[15:03:55] <Raziel> through a game of yu-gi-oh.
[15:03:58] <jotham> you can't have good data about humans to form a good opinion and i don't know why

[15:13:22] <Juliu> I thought so as well for a long time. And it's partially true, which is why I never took any money from the government
[15:13:55] <jotham> ERROH: we just had the largest arora in 9-11 years

[15:15:44] <jotham> oh these ones https://twitter.com/five15design/status/1456415398883069958
[15:15:59] <jotham> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FDac8NUUYAALw5q?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
[15:16:01] <jotham> that's banging
[15:16:06] <Raziel> noice
[15:16:44] <Raziel> best I can do is the aurora localized entirely within my ram sticks https://i.imgur.com/eRmEIHw.jpg
[15:16:45] <Raziel> qq
[15:16:57] <jotham> hehe
[15:17:36] <jotham> that location just lost the bid to hold the new american antarctic base resupply, so it's fairly south and also it's cold as fuck
[15:17:46] <jotham> probably not to a scandiavian
[15:17:50] <jotham> but is to us here
[15:18:02] <jotham> was going to be the capital of NZ
[15:18:06] <jotham> (dunedin city)
[15:18:44] <jotham> new base is way further north, was wondering if that was a climate change thing
[15:18:52] <jotham> you'd think southern bases would become better
[15:19:02] <jotham> but storms are intensifying down there
[15:19:55] <jotham> if there is one idea i'd like to explain to climate change deniers
[15:20:01] <jotham> it's that there is more energy in the system
[15:20:11] <jotham> but maybe that requires a lot of other ideas to make any sense
[15:22:33] <jotham> nz doesn't even really show up on the official climate models - i dunno if this is offensive or just that we're too weird and small - https://climatearchive.org/
[15:22:52] <jotham> maybe it's better we don't exist on the maps and everyone ignores us, and one day the internet just stops working
[15:22:58] <jotham> and that's the last we hear about the world
[15:23:40] <jotham> i always look at madagascar
[15:23:48] <jotham> everyone models and keeps madagascar on the maps
[15:23:52] <jotham> but we always fall off them
[15:24:18] <jotham> maybe it's super important to african surface moisture flow

[20:48:34] <ERROH> i expect us getting a carrington event just as soon as we figure the covid thing
[20:51:08] <Bakunin> sounds realistic
[20:51:21] <Bakunin> we definitely need about half the humans on the planet to die
[20:52:55] <T`aZ> i suggest 90%
[20:53:09] <T`aZ> and yes, a simple natural selection of 0.1% less is completely not acceptable
[20:53:13] <T`aZ> we are doomed
[20:53:17] <T`aZ> s/yes/yet/
[20:59:17] <Renderwww> nooo, no carrington event. I need my electronics for stimulating my fun center in the brain
