[17:06:26] <labrador> DiffieHellman, ECH is encrypted client handshake
[17:06:27] * Andrew hires leonarth and provides per with Microsoft DOS
[17:06:30] <leonarth> I tried installing debian on it, didn't work
[17:06:37] <Andrew> leonarth: What computer is that?
[17:06:39] <labrador> You know how tls works right DiffieHellman ?
[17:06:42] <labrador> tls 1,3
[17:06:45] <Andrew> Oh, probably a MacBook
[17:06:50] <leonarth> MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)
[17:07:15] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Yes. I've heard of encrypting the client handshake sooner to leak less dafa
[17:07:15] <leonarth> what distro you on Andrew 
[17:07:16] <Andrew> I've heard a friend install Arch "Linux" on a 2018 MacBook Pro though
[17:07:21] <Andrew> leonarth: Gentoo
[17:07:30] <DiffieHellman> Arch *systemd/Linux
[17:07:31] <labrador> So basically DiffieHellman tls 1.3 sends the client hello(containg sni or esni) and the server hello in plaintext
[17:07:39] <labrador> After that everything is encrypted
[17:07:40] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Right :)
[17:07:47] <labrador> ECH makes the entire handshake encrypted
[17:07:52] <labrador> Nothing is plain text
[17:07:56] <labrador> Which is awesome
[17:08:04] <labrador> Less issues of censorship
[17:08:05] <leonarth> has xfce?
[17:08:11] * Andrew GPGs his IRC again
[17:08:13] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Yup, too bad you can't encrypt the very beginning of the handshake
[17:08:19] <labrador> DiffieHellman, you can
[17:08:22] <labrador> Thats what ECH is
[17:08:31] <labrador> It encrypts messages from the client hello
[17:08:32] <Andrew> leonarth: Yes, there are XFCE ebuilds for Gentoo
[17:08:35] <labrador> IE the first message
[17:08:36] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Can't encrypt key agreememt :3
[17:08:41] <labrador> DiffieHellman, you can
[17:08:43] <Andrew> I use exwm, dwm, awesome, and bspwm though
[17:08:49] <labrador> The key is kept in DNS DiffieHellman 
[17:08:58] <Andrew> Well, also 9wm, but that's different.
[17:08:59] <leonarth> has anybody tried off the record over irc?
[17:09:00] <labrador> It works basically like this
[17:09:06] <labrador> There's two CHs
[17:09:10] <Andrew> leonarth: No, I haven't
[17:09:14] <Andrew> I only tried GPG over IRC
[17:09:18] <labrador> 1 is Outer client hello
[17:09:23] <labrador> 2 is inner client hello
[17:09:35] <labrador> ICH is encrypted with the server's key you found in DNS
[17:09:36] <leonarth> how: gpg text locally and send?
[17:09:39] <DiffieHellman> labrador: Well, the DNS isn't encypted
[17:09:44] <labrador> DiffieHellman, DOH
[17:09:46] <labrador> It is
[17:09:56] <leonarth> or there's a plugin to start priv conversations
[17:10:02] <Andrew> And I did that by writing a simple script that sent base64'ed gpg messages (taken from stdin) to ~/irc/irc.andrewyu.org/#LibreIRC 
[17:10:02] <labrador> DoH and DoT is both encrypted
[17:10:08] <labrador> So that key is safe
[17:10:13] <Andrew> I'm not using a normal IRC client, so not exactly
[17:10:22] <labrador> DiffieHellman, anyway if its the right key
[17:10:38] <labrador> The OCH does nothing while the ICH is used to intiate the sesssio
[17:10:39] <labrador> n
[17:10:43] <DiffieHellman> leonarth: But those rely on handshakes that aren't fully encryted unless you do ECH, but then you get an infinite loop :3
[17:11:06] <leonarth> DiffieHellman you mean the OTR protocol?
[17:11:07] <labrador> While if its wrong DiffieHellman you get a response back with the actual server key that works using the OCH
[17:11:13] <labrador> The ICH is discarded
[17:11:16] <labrador> Its so cool

[17:13:42] <Andrew> profanity, my client, supports it

[17:14:01] <labrador> Its not in the spec

[17:14:19] <labrador> Like irssi's otr extension...nobody can really talk on it

[17:14:26] <labrador> As its not a standard

[17:18:13] <labrador> With FS that doesn't happen
[17:18:39] <leonarth> how does that work, changes key every message?
[17:18:52] <Andrew> Probably incorporating some kind of timestamp into the message, I guess
[17:18:54] <labrador> Key exchange algos like DHE or ECDHE provide these properties
[17:18:56] <Andrew> s/message/key/
[17:18:57] <labrador> Andrew, no
[17:19:07] <Andrew> Hmm
[17:19:09] <labrador> A session key is generated for each message
[17:19:15] <labrador> And then forgotten after
[17:19:17] <leonarth> thought it's using something like RandomX
[17:19:29] <Andrew> RandomX, that's pretty advanced
[17:19:47] <labrador> Andrew, basically pgp is a downgrade in security compared to omemo
[17:19:53] <labrador> Use the better thing
[17:19:55] <Andrew> labrador: Got it
[17:19:56] <leonarth> labrador so it's generating a main key which is used to generate session keys for every message

[17:23:50] <labrador> leonarth, well you hold the shared secret so ofc you can
[17:23:51] <labrador> lol
[17:24:20] <leonarth> need to install a bugus crt though
[17:25:00] <labrador> leonarth, hmm yes that would work...but you're not really spoofing DHE. Just the auth mechanism for those ephemereal keys
[17:25:26] <labrador> So basically the client thinks hmm yes this DH key is X's even tho no its Y's
[17:25:49] <leonarth> I use it #1 for debugging, in order to see the params on tls requests
[17:26:04] <leonarth> and #2 to check what data this macbook is sending to apple
[17:26:13] <labrador> leonarth, nice. So you would know right how tls works?
[17:26:28] <labrador> It bypasses vpns...can also probably bypass your filter too
[17:26:34] <labrador> Its in vain basically
[17:27:22] <leonarth> no tls traffic is truly private as long as there's a CA issuing your certs
[17:28:10] <labrador> leonarth, the system can disobey you tho by hiding its messages
