[00:02:34] <alerque> ian|: Yes you can group commands, but the example you give is non-sensical. The subshell started by the open paren will recieve the output of the second cat, meaning STDIN when `ps` is run will ... not be read, and discarded. So the whole chain would just be the equivalent of `ps | grep`

[00:04:33] <NeverSummer> alerque, he was expecting it to do ps | grep first and then just run cat on that twice.
[00:04:43] <NeverSummer> So essentially execute right to left.
[00:05:22] <NeverSummer> Which is not what the parenthesis do.  It's not like algebra rules.  Making the answer to your question just "no" ian|
[00:05:42] <NeverSummer> They aren't ignored but they also don't do that.  They do something else which is not the thing you want.
[00:05:46] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[00:05:50] <alerque> NeverSummer: In that case input redirects are more to the point: `cat <(ps | grep)`
[00:05:56] <demize> Even if that was what happened, it was after the cat commands in the pipeline so they couldn't have done anything with it.
[00:06:16] <NeverSummer> Right.
[00:06:31] <NeverSummer> You can execute in a different order than the one the commands are typed in using more complicated syntax.
[00:06:35] <demize> So I think it's a bit of big assumption to make without clarification.
[00:06:45] <NeverSummer> This is a thing you can do, it's just not how parenthesis work specifically.

[00:14:32] <Freneticks> is there a way to build a efi boot on a legacy boot arch ?

[00:15:02] <thrice> what does "a efi boot" mean?
[00:15:37] <NeverSummer> I think he means he booted the install environment in legacy mode but wishes to create a UEFI install using it.
[00:15:47] <Freneticks> exactly
[00:15:49] <NeverSummer> The question if that's true is... why?  Just reboot in UEFI mode.
[00:16:00] <thrice> agree

[00:16:06] <NeverSummer> It takes like 10 seconds.
[00:16:29] <Freneticks> how can i reboot in uefi mode if I have no uefi boot loader ?
[00:16:48] <NeverSummer> The UEFI bootloader for the Arch install environment is on the USB.
[00:16:56] <thrice> the arch usb will do the right thing
[00:16:58] <NeverSummer> The flash drive should appear in the motherboard boot menu twice.
[00:17:11] <NeverSummer> One of the two options is preceded by [UEFI].
[00:17:14] <NeverSummer> You just pick that one.
[00:17:32] <NeverSummer> The bootloader on the flash drive will automatically boot in UEFI mode if the motherboard chooses that bootloader.

[00:18:41] <NeverSummer> You made it sound like a clean install.  fstab doesn't exist yet.
[00:18:43] <thrice> so you've already installed the system and want to convert it?
[00:18:55] <NeverSummer> That's a very different question.
[00:19:17] <Freneticks> oh sorry yeah it's a very old install full luks
[00:19:30] <Freneticks> and i want to migrate to uefi 
[00:19:39] <thrice> without reinstalling?
[00:19:44] <Freneticks> yeah
[00:20:11] <thrice> It might be possible, but I would think you would need an in-between step of booting the arch ISO
[00:20:14] <NeverSummer> Well this is the part where I say I've never done that because any time I need to change an OS thing that sounds difficult in any way I just reinstall the whole thing.
[00:20:38] <thrice> the complication will come with the ESP
[00:20:45] <NeverSummer> But yes you can do that from the Arch installation image, but the same thing applies.  Boot it in UEFI mode.

[05:13:31] <drew_gui> also thank you for taking the time to help me out with this
[05:14:18] <kevr> drew_gui: np. If you take a look at your kernel log, you can see some messages prefixed with 'ata6'
[05:14:44] <kevr> drew_gui: then some acpi errors
[05:14:55] <drew_gui> slow to respond, yes i see it
[05:14:57] <kevr> honestly, this does seem like a hardware issue with the drive, possibly.
[05:15:04] <kevr> but i'm not 100% on that
[05:15:44] <kevr> hell, this is also odd:
[05:16:06] <Hello71> i don't see anything wrong
[05:16:09] <kevr> Jul 10 20:31:17 bluebox kernel: ata4: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300) this is what happens with ata when you go to suspend with Jul 10 20:31:17 bluebox kernel: ata4.00: configured for UDMA/100
[05:16:22] <kevr> Then, when you wake up, all we get is this: Jul 10 20:31:24 bluebox kernel: ata6: SATA link up 6.0 Gbps (SStatus 133 SControl 300)
[05:16:42] <kevr> drew_gui: do you have a sata ssd/hard drive plugged in too?
[05:17:18] <kevr> I see you have an NVMe, which has nothing to do with sata
[05:17:25] <drew_gui> yes, i have an nvme ssd for root and a sata hard drive for /home

[05:54:02] <Enitin> So... I have a question. Recently my Arch Linux install sometimes doesn't want to start any GUI programs. I noticed that my hostname isn't the one I set in "/etc/hosts". But after connecting to my network it changes to the one I specified within the hosts file. Before that it uses some hostname that looks like it was specified by my router. Even though it's not connected and changes to the right one when connected. (I auto connect to a VPN 
[05:54:03] <Enitin> when connecting to my network.) I'm pointing all that out because I noticed that the "~/.Xauthority" file has the wrong hostname in it. (The one not specified in the hosts file.) Which made me think: Maybe it won't open any GUI programs because the .Xauthority file is wrongly created at boot time because of the wrong hostname. Is anyone here that could help me fix that?
[05:54:05] <Enitin> When I try to start firefox for example I get this error message:
[05:54:06] <Enitin> Unable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused
[05:54:08] <Enitin> Error: cannot open display: :0
[05:54:09] <Enitin> In my opinion it shouldn't even change the hostname at all. Right?
[05:54:11] <Enitin> Why does it even do that?

[06:13:06] <jaawerth> yeah I've worked with zfs before but I don't need its special sauce to make it worth doing all the kernel stuff

[17:01:41] <MacGyver> What that will do is make sure the OOM-killer kicks in a bit before you hit this (seemingly) locked up situation.
[17:01:51] <MacGyver> If that happens, well, you can be fairly certain what the problem was.
[17:02:00] <low-key> Did that

[17:06:39] <MacGyver> Yeah, so, your system has an underlying and known issue that you will hit *whenever* all your memory is gone.
[17:07:32] <MacGyver> The best way I know of to prevent it in the future is to make that setting I just told you to run on the command line permanent, by adding "vm.min_free_kbytes = 112640" to config in /etc/sysctl.d

[23:43:02] <Pseudocrat> I tried switching from using IWD/IWCTL to using NetworkManager with IWD backend, but NetworkManager sees my wlan0 interface as disconnected and only IWD is able to connect to my SSID. Am I missing something besides setting wifi.backend=iwd?

[23:45:14] <johnnyapol> I usually setup iwd+NetworkManager pretty early but I believe when you convert you need to add your wireless networks into NetworkManager so it can store the credentials

[23:49:16] <johnnyapol> NetworkManager should start iwd itself. You should have networkmanager enabled and make sure you disable or mask wpa_supplicant
[23:49:34] <johnnyapol> You also do need to restart network manager if you havent already
