[02:07:37] <companion_cube> better than scrolling wheels? it's a question of taste
[02:07:41] <cwup74> kensington slim blade - no scroll wheel, but you can scroll by turning the ball like the cap of a bottle. i like it.
[02:08:18] <technomancy> cwup74: there's something satisfying about a scroll wheel where you can feel the bumps as you turn it.
[02:09:17] <bsandro> hm, what if touchpads used haptic feedback for two finger scroll
[02:09:21] <cwup74> technomancy: no bump on the slim blade, but it produces an audible click.
[02:09:42] <technomancy> ah nice. wonder how they manage that.

[04:51:09] <manicennui> Operator precedence. Goodie.
[04:51:25] <manicennui> A precedence declaration in operator takes the form of keyword blocks at the start of the operator's body. The possible keyword options for prefix operators are 'weaker_than', 'stronger_than', 'same_as', or 'same_as_on_left'.
[04:51:54] <manicennui> I guess I don't understand what this accomplishes other than creating another weird syntax that people won't want to use.
[04:52:38] <technomancy> yeah I'm always suspicious of people designing a language for the masses that they aren't interested in using themselves
[04:58:20] <manicennui> I wouldn't be surprised if they manage to decrease their userbase by heading down this path.

[05:06:48] <gwozniak> Ugh. I mean, I'm not keeping up with Racket and such, but that proposal is just a massive turn off
[05:08:35] <gwozniak> I'd really love to do away with operator precedence
[05:09:02] <manicennui> Already a solved problem in Racket.
[05:09:09] <manicennui> This new syntax would make it a new problem.
[05:10:46] <gwozniak> I'm assuming if they are using s-expr or something like it, precedence is not an issue
[05:11:21] <manicennui> Yeah, Racket is a scheme.

[21:22:01] <shapr> that's when the msp430 and all those other dev boards came out and did not catch on
[21:22:32] <shapr> SparkFun and AdaFruit bootstrapped themselves from building Arduino clones, to minor improvements, to full on separate boards
[21:23:18] <shapr> When Arduino first came out, having a bootloader that was still there after uploading code was a HUGE IMPROVEMENT
[21:23:43] <shapr> even then, all of the "real" embedded devs at my hackerspace dismissed the Arduino as a tinker-toy
[21:23:55] <shapr> several years later, they were all using Arduino
[21:23:59] <technomancy> Arduino succeeded because they actually wrote documentation
[21:24:09] <technomancy> the hardware itself is super meh
[21:24:24] <shapr> yeah, it was just an atmega328
[21:24:30] <technomancy> all the technically superior stuff was targeted at people who had already spent decades learning the toolchains and shit
[21:24:30] <shapr> with a bootloader
[21:24:34] <shapr> right!
[21:25:18] <shapr> Max Kreminski had a tweet "if people are using your tool to produce loads of crap, that's a clear win for accessibility"
[21:25:29] <manicennui> Isn't the Pi in a similar situation?
[21:25:34] <technomancy> it's like they're going around yelling "why won't anyone appreciate my brilliance" but they can't comprehend even the most basic of usability concerns
[21:25:46] <shapr> I spent an entire weekend failing to get an LED blinking on the msp430 boards, and gave up on them forever
[21:25:56] <technomancy> manicennui: not at first; there was nothing like the Pi when it came out
[21:25:59] <shapr> On the Arduino, it took fifteen minutes, and most of that was making sure I had the right cable.
[21:26:04] <manicennui> I've noticed that a large number of hobbyist embedded kits depend on the Arduino toolchain now.
[21:26:32] <shapr> Once the Arduino IDE was installed, and the board connected correctly, blinking an LED takes less than a minute.
[21:27:14] <shapr> I built a whole bunch of projects with Arduino, but I've since switched to Circuit Python because it's more accessible.
[21:27:23] <manicennui> The thing I'm curious about is how much of the Arduino development experience translates to real embedded development.
[21:27:37] <shapr> manicennui: depends on what you mean by "real"
[21:27:50] <shapr> if you mean building projects for commercial sales, not so much

[21:31:22] <shapr> companion_cube: I think it's a fork?
[21:31:29] <companion_cube> hmm
[21:31:59] <shapr> previously, interacting with your running project was a huge pain
[21:32:02] <manicennui> shapr: I don't have any plans to get into embedded development, but if I did, I'd want to do something with controlling large production systems or robotics or something.
[21:32:11] <shapr> experimenting had a long turnaround time
[21:32:24] <shapr> now I can drop into the circuit python repl and write code interactively to see what works
[21:33:14] <manicennui> I don't know why, but seeing python creep its way into so many different areas is irritating to me.
[21:33:18] * shapr shrugs
[21:33:22] <shapr> I'd MUCH prefer Haskell
[21:33:37] *** Joins: plsm (~plsm@user/plsm)
[21:33:38] <shapr> but circuit python is way better than the weird mix of C and C++ the Arduino used
[21:33:45] <manicennui> There's not a single popular language that is actually good.
[21:34:00] <manicennui> It's always the worst languages that become popular.
[21:34:01] <shapr> Arduino was still better than whatever fork of C each dev board used before that
[21:34:10] <companion_cube> could have been lua!
[21:34:20] <shapr> sure, lua would have been a great choice
[21:34:36] <manicennui> Then you could run fennel!
[21:34:55] <dsc_> not sure why you would want to run python on embedded devices, and this is coming from a 10+ year python dev :P

[21:35:11] <technomancy> well, not having a repl is miserable
[21:35:15] <companion_cube> it's not actual python, dsc_, afaict
[21:35:15] <shapr> yeah, very much so
[21:35:22] <shapr> having a repl is just better
[21:35:22] <companion_cube> it's a more efficient, less dynamic version
[21:35:25] <companion_cube> at least for micropython
[21:35:40] <manicennui> shapr: Nice.
[21:36:00] <shapr> that's one of many projects I've built with CircuitPython on top of AdaFruit hardware
[21:36:22] <shapr> I use that bloohm project whenever I'm writing code

[21:37:10] <shapr> My in-laws asked me about under cabinet lighting, so I grabbed some of my neopixel strips and I'll be double-stick taping them underneath their cabinets.
[21:37:38] <technomancy> do they really need full individual-pixel-addressable RGB?
[21:37:43] <shapr> nope!
[21:38:10] <technomancy> the ones where you change the color of the whole strip at a time are waaaay cheaper than neopixels
[21:38:41] <shapr> yeah, but I already have this macropad handy https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040
[21:38:42] <mockturtle> [ Adafruit MacroPad RP2040 ] - learn.adafruit.com

[21:38:59] * manicennui made a strobe light in high school.
[21:39:23] <manicennui> Kind of dangerous because it built up a huge charge in a capacitor.
