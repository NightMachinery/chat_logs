[00:07:36] <johncs> Rust is fine :P
[00:07:57] <johncs> every language lots of people build stuff in is fine
[00:08:51] <johncs> Stuff just looks weird if you donâ€™t have experience with it yet, and thereâ€™s a straightforward solution to that ;)

[01:40:12] <bookworm> sure, because Option<Box<Node<'a>>> is a sane looking concept is it?
[01:40:34] <bookworm> compare that to the simplicity of go
[01:41:06] <bookworm> rust has many c++ / perlism let's use all the symbols on a keyboard and then some disease

[04:17:52] <johncs> one of go's explicit design goals (if some random interview from some go-lang dev i remember from long ago is to be believed) was to be easily understandable and workable by junior devs who've hardly used it. which is rad and i'm very into it. but I think not having that as a requirement for your language is also very reasonable.

[16:51:58] <xnaas> c014: I use and love Sopel. Writing my own plugins is stupid easy. 
[16:52:11] <xnaas> re: bot conversation
[17:06:34] <c014> I know a few people using sopel.. but they seem to have problems now and then
[17:08:05] <xnaas> idk, I run two â€“ one here on libera and another on my own network without really any issues Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:08:11] <xnaas> if a bug comes up, I report it and it gets fixed
[17:08:42] <xnaas> The quality documentation helps a lot, too.
[17:08:50] <xnaas> But I know people are incapable of reading docs... ðŸ˜…
[17:11:42] <shadoozo> docs? what are those?
[17:11:46] <xnaas> ^ :P
[17:11:52] <xnaas> doc martin shoes /s
[17:11:58] <shadoozo> :P
[17:15:52] <c014> docs have a way of being too long and boring
[17:16:05] <c014> Sometimes you just wanna jumpstart.. 
[17:16:40] <xnaas> That's what I did, pretty much. Tried a shitload of bots and Sopel was the only one that #JustWorked for me. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[17:17:20] <xnaas> It was also, by far, the easiest to write my custom plugins for. Had a lot of shit to port over from our Discord days ðŸ˜…
[17:18:50] <xnaas> Worst was probably eggdrop followed by cloudbot lol
[17:21:26] <shadoozo> cloudbot wasn't that bad?
[17:22:34] <xnaas> I didn't say closely followed by. :P
[17:22:46] <shadoozo> Fair :P
[17:23:14] <xnaas> at any rate, obviously people should just pick what works for them
[17:23:24] <xnaas> if you love eggdrop for some sick, twisted reason: rock on
[17:23:25] <xnaas> you do you
[17:23:26] <xnaas> :P
[17:23:30] <shadoozo> haha
[17:26:44] <c014> Eggdrop feels like something from the 80's
[17:32:45] <xnaas> IRC is something from the 80s.
[17:32:47] <xnaas> ;P
[17:32:52] <xnaas> 33 years and counting!
[17:37:24] <c014> And so little evolution
[17:38:20] <xnaas> that's because fat nerds people hate change
[17:38:45] <xnaas> but, lack of growth of features aside, at least it still just works
[17:39:05] <xnaas> I don't know any other chat platforms that are still going 30 years later :P
