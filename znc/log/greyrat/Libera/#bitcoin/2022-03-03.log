[00:24:57] <Guest80> hi
[00:26:28] <Guest41> I have currently 55 miners they are in Russia.. I want to sell does someone know where I can sell them
[00:26:46] <belcher> you mean ASICs?
[00:26:50] <Guest41> yes
[00:27:03] <Guest41> S19 pro & Z15's
[00:27:47] <belcher> no idea, except that this guide for mining (https://diverter.hostyourown.tools/mining-for-the-streets/) mentions some telegram channels where people trade ASICs
[00:28:03] <belcher> i have no experience with it at all though

[15:36:54] <Alexthek1d>  -- So: Fiat money € ---> Cold wallet with Coins
[15:37:31] <buZz> by buying them
[15:37:33] <certiorari> from what exchange?
[15:37:39] <buZz> and withdrawing to the wallet
[15:37:42] <certiorari> use slow transaction..?
[15:37:57] <buZz> -cheapest- would be buying a privkey directly ;)
[15:37:59] <buZz> no tx

[15:45:25] <buZz> ;) yeah just trying to underline
[15:45:54] <Henry151> Alexthek1d: swanbitcoin.com is probably the lowest fees available in the USA, at the moment, as far as I know
[15:46:19] <Alexthek1d> Henry151, thank you. I am from germany tho :s
[15:46:22] <buZz> Henry151: obv they arent in US , like most people
[15:47:00] <Henry151> Ah, I see. Not sure whether swan provides service to Germany, I don't think so though, I believe they only serve US market
[15:47:45] <buZz> Henry151: yeah like most US products its completely irrelevant to anyone ;)
[15:48:03] <Henry151> really though, the difference between paying 0.25% on one exchange or paying 1.5% on another i think is really negligible in the long term
[15:48:18] <buZz> fyi thats not even a exchange
[15:48:24] <Henry151> buZz: thanks for reminding me that we're not the center of the world
[15:48:36] <Henry151> and yes, I realize, swan is not an exchange, just a vendor
[15:48:49] <buZz> Henry151: just a sad colony that decided to never return the land to the native ppl
[15:48:50] <Henry151> which is better anyway in my opinion, because there's never a good reason to sell bitcoin.
[15:48:58] <dodo> i use kraken in europe.. 0.00002 fee
[15:49:08] <dodo> ;;calc [tlast] * 0.00002
[15:49:08] <gribble> 0.8713922
[15:49:11] <dodo> hm
[15:49:17] <buZz> bitwala is a similar service Henry151 , that -does- do international
[15:49:44] <Henry151> i use kraken sometimes as well
[15:49:50] <dodo> yup
[15:49:55] <Henry151> buZz: really? I haven't heard of bitwala, i'll check them out
[15:50:01] <Alexthek1d> dodo thanks
[15:50:04] <dodo> bitwala is called nuri now, their fees are outrageous
[15:50:08] <Henry151> i really like the culture at swan
[15:50:16] <Henry151> they "get it" in my opinion.
[15:50:17] <Alexthek1d> do you have to pay for deposit and withdraw ?
[15:50:18] <Alexthek1d> Fiat money (€) -> [fee-1] --> exchange --> [fee-2] ---> cold storage wallet
[15:50:38] <buZz> Alexthek1d: wtf , no
[15:50:45] <buZz> Alexthek1d: there are no BTC tx on FIAT
[15:51:04] <buZz> so likewise, there is no BTC fee you pay for a FIAT transfer
[15:51:23] <buZz> Henry151: they look very untrustable and bunch of noods
[15:51:25] <buZz> noobs*
[15:52:30] <buZz> they -barely- exist two years, whahahaha
[15:52:32] <Alexthek1d> okay thanks buZz
[15:52:33] <Henry151> any time you transfer bitcoin from one address to another, you'll have to pay a "network fee". So you're going to pay one fee to the exchange or vendor, probably something between 0.25% and 2%, and then when you withdraw the funds from the vendor's wallet to your own private wallet, you (or the vendor, but probably you) will have to pay a bitcoin network fee, which is not percentage-based but can vary
[15:52:39] <Henry151> depending on how busy the bitcoin network is at the time of your transaction, and how fast you want it to confirm.
[15:52:53] <buZz> > There are approx­i­mately 100,000 Bitcoiners in the United States.
[15:52:58] <buZz> complete nonsense
[15:53:26] <buZz> and cory cant buy a suit that fits :D
[15:53:31] <Henry151> buZz: I was using Gemini for all my acquisition until I found swan. Better fees, they encourage you to withdraw your coins to your own private wallet, and they link to good articles and good authors, good content
[15:54:04] <Henry151> their meme vault is also to my taste :)
[15:54:26] <buZz> Henry151: those arent comparable at all
[15:54:34] <Henry151> I'm on the way to the poker tournament at the "Unconfiscatable" bitcoin conference in Las Vegas right now
[15:54:40] <buZz> Henry151: try bitwala, they actually exist for more than 2 covid handouts
[15:54:48] <Henry151> buZz: they're comparable because they're both places where I can acquire bitcoin :)
[15:54:49] <buZz> yeah lol, -poker- :D

[15:55:20] <buZz> one is a exchange, the other is funding cory's poor ability to buy suits that fit
[15:55:23] <Henry151> They may be very dissimilar, but they're definitely both "places where I can acquire bitcoin", and that's all I ever did at Gemini

[15:55:52] <Alexthek1d> dodo: what is that calculation u made? ;;calc [tlast] * 0.00002
[15:55:55] <buZz> yeah , like you can buy candy at a woodstore
[15:55:55] <Henry151> well, all I did recently anyway. I learned not to mess with s***coins a long time ago
[15:56:03] <buZz> that doesnt make a woodstore a candyshop
[15:56:15] <Henry151> can you buy candy at a woodstore? what's a woodstore?
[15:56:22] <buZz> a store that sells wood
[15:56:37] <Henry151> if the same candy bar costs more at the candyshop than it does at the woodstore, I'm going to buy mine from the woodstore, thanks

[15:57:46] <Henry151> swan also allows for recurring buys and encourages a daily buy / dollar-cost-averaging strategy, which is what I recommend, and unlike coinbase or gemini, they don't charge you extra fees for that recurring buy service.
[15:58:01] <buZz> check out bitwala before your gooseservice disappears
[15:58:08] <Henry151> I was previously using the pyca dca script to buy from gemini
[15:58:20] <buZz> DCA for btc purchases is literally what bitwala does since day1
[15:58:32] <buZz> for many many years
[15:58:49] <Henry151> i thought someone just said bitwala changed their name and charges higher fees than they used to? but I'll still investigate, sounds like a good operation
[15:59:20] <buZz> ah, nuri now
[15:59:29] <Alexthek1d> Ah so you pay "1 BTC * 0.000002 = 0.78552 Euro" -> and it doesnt matter if you buy coins for 100€ or for 20000€ , right? (at kraken)
[16:00:02] <buZz> Alexthek1d: bitcoin fees indeed have nothing to do with fiat, nor bitcoin amount
[16:00:09] <buZz> its for bytesize in the blockchain
[16:00:15] <Henry151> another thing I like about swan, that I haven't seen elsewhere (and doesn't look to be the case at bitwala/nuri) is that they *only* sell bitcoin, they don't buy it and they don't sell any of the s***coins like ethereum
[16:00:30] <Alexthek1d> Oh i meant withdraw sorry
[16:00:39] <buZz> Alexthek1d: there's no such thing
[16:00:44] <buZz> there are only transactions
[16:00:57] <Henry151> I'm pretty excited about this bitcoin conference thing in Vegas
[16:01:01] <buZz> what direction the bitcoin is moving doest

[16:01:10] <buZz> Henry151: yeah nice place to get mugged
[16:01:21] <Henry151> I've never been to vegas before, and I've only flown in a plane about 5 times in my life
[16:01:44] <buZz> good. dont be the waste that most your nation is :)
[16:01:45] <Henry151> certainly never flown in a plane to a conference full of people who are all into bitcoin
[16:01:54] <buZz> poluting the world with their lack of public transport
[16:02:22] <Henry151> buZz: I am quite in agreement about Americans, they're awful folks in general, I'm embarrassed to admit I was born here, sorry.
[16:02:28] <buZz> well
[16:02:38] <buZz> keep voting on parties that promise to fix public transport
[16:02:50] <buZz> 'two party systems' is just communism with extra steps
[16:03:19] * buZz throws himself out of bed finally
[16:03:28] <Henry151> oh, well then clearly we dislike americans for entirely different reasons :P I am firmly against voting on principle, y'know, the whole "man has no right to rule over his neighbor, and my neighbors have no right to elect a ruler who claims authority over me" angle
[16:03:33] <buZz> one of my bff's works at gemini
[16:03:40] <Henry151> nice!
[16:03:45] <buZz> Henry151: yeah thats how you get communism
[16:04:03] <Henry151> I applied for a python developer role there but I was not experienced enough for any of the available positions
[16:04:19] <buZz> this guy is fullstack devops thingy

[16:07:56] <Henry151> but I'd so much rather be working in the bitcoin industry, so that's the idea behind going to this Unconfiscatable conference, to hope to make some connections and possibly find a job at a bitcoin-related company

[16:10:15] <Henry151> so i signed up for the conference, and then i noticed the poker tournament, and thought hey, maybe that will pay for the trip if i get lucky; and if not, well it's billed as a "bitcoin celebrity poker tournament" with 25 of the 100 seats reserved for influential or well-known people in the bitcoin community, so even if i don't win anything, i might get to sit at a table with some people i want to meet
[16:10:54] <Henry151> so i dropped the 0.01btc on the entry fee (by buying it of course, not dipping in to my previously acquired btc)
[16:11:07] <buZz> hmhm, i dont really condone gambling
[16:11:32] <Henry151> well that's sensible, i don't encourage it really. But I do enjoy it.
[16:12:03] <buZz> i dont condone , enjoy or encourage anyone to do any gambling
[16:12:31] <belcher> Henry151 id recommend contributing to some open source bitcoin projects on github or other places, that should be a great reference when applying to jobs
[16:13:14] <Alexthek1d> @ buzz u said "Alexthek1d: there's no such thing

[16:14:14] <Henry151> belcher: yeah that's excellent guidance! I have been watching the bitcoin github and looking for any possible way to make even the smallest contribution to bitcoin itself for several years now. it's hard when so many talented developers are already working on it. But there are plenty of other open-source bitcoin-related projects and I probably should apply myself to one of them instead.
[16:14:36] <belcher> not necessarily "the bitcoin github", since thats just bitcoin core, there are many other bitcoin projects

[16:14:53] <belcher> have you read some of this material https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html
[16:15:15] <buZz> Alexthek1d: thats not related to bitcoin
[16:15:34] <buZz> the fees on commercial services like that arent really related to actual on-chain fees being paid
[16:15:37] <Henry151> even to fix a typo in the docs of bitcoin core, and get my name on the "contributors to core" list, would be super exciting :)
[16:15:46] <buZz> i think i have that
[16:15:47] <buZz> not sure

[16:17:45] <belcher> no thats lopp's
[16:18:02] <belcher> Henry151 "getting your name" isnt really useful id say, more useful is actually writing code
[16:18:16] <belcher> if you cant contribute to an existing project you could start by writing your own play projects, for example a simple bitcoin wallet
[16:19:33] <Henry151> belcher: oh well yes, agreed, fixing a typo in core docs would be pretty insignificant in terms of actual contribution to the community, it would just be exciting... but you're absolutely right i should focus on finding how i can make real contributions to the world instead
[16:20:41] <Henry151> i would rather go the route of trying to contribute to existing projects rather than making a "play project" because i think i'd be more likely to actually provide something valuable that way
[16:21:53] <Henry151> i mean to look at the example you provided, if i were to make a simple bitcoin wallet, i think it would be unlikely to be any competition to existing wallets or improvement on existing wallets, since i'm relatively inexperienced, and so i'd feel like i were just practicing, rather than actually providing value
[16:22:27] <belcher> play projects are very useful to actually learn
[16:22:36] <belcher> sure maybe nobody will use them in real life but thats okay
[16:22:46] <belcher> and they're also good references to show when applying for jobs
[16:22:53] <Henry151> fair points for sure
[16:23:55] <Henry151> well i've got to make my way towards the gate for my flight now, but it was fun chatting, thanks for the ideas and input

[17:24:51] <belcher> i.e. if you have 1btc and you type in to send 1btc, there wont be enough including miner fees
[17:25:29] <belcher> bitcoin-qt has an option something like "sender pays for fees", which takes away the fee from the amount, so instead of 1btc you'd get something like 0.999998btc and fully empty your wallet

[23:00:12] *** Joins: mudsip (~mudsip@user/mudsip)
[23:00:42] <slave_blocker> i want to use open timestamps, to put a hash in the btc chain proving that i was the first to own a document. How do i go about it ?

[23:15:32] <Victorsueca> slave_blocker: you can create a raw transaction with an OP_RETURN output that contains the hash you want to include
[23:16:55] <Victorsueca> slave_blocker: if you're using a recent version of the bitcoin core UI, you get an option to turn prune on and set the amount of storage to use in the initial setup, if you missed that, you can also do it in the configuration menu
[23:18:45] <Victorsueca> if you're using a terminal, you can pass the -prune=X flag, or place prune=X in the bitcoin.conf file

[23:30:28] <Ara> The number after prune is mb not gb
[23:30:36] <slave_blocker> uhh using an OP_RETURN instead of a tool from opentime stamps... How do i do that?
[23:30:49] *** Fauto_ is now known as Fausto
[23:32:32] <slave_blocker> does that mean that i am sending money to a hash from wich no one can spend? Instead of an address?

[23:36:21] <Victorsueca> slave_blocker: I think you would have to set prune=457764 since it's in MiB
[23:36:53] <slave_blocker> ok
[23:37:10] <slave_blocker> again, no sync from scratch right?
[23:37:41] <Victorsueca> you would only need to sync from scratch if you increase the prune size or disable prune
[23:38:12] <Victorsueca> and yes, no one would be able to spend from that OP_RETURN, so I would suggest that you send the minimum amount that won't be labeled as dust which is 1000 satoshi

[23:39:08] <slave_blocker> what happens if its dust?
[23:39:14] <slave_blocker> will it be rejected?
[23:39:59] <Victorsueca> dust is technically valid, but most nodes will refuse to relay transactions labeled as dust
[23:40:27] <Victorsueca> this is a measure to prevent DOS attacks

[23:51:37] <slave_blocker> can this be done with electrum?
[23:53:30] <Victorsueca> I never used electrum for something like that, but IIRC it has a python scriping interface, so maybe you can create the transaction with that
[23:53:38] <Victorsueca> scripting*
