[03:33:04] <raccoon_dog> I mean, I feel for them that they're wasting their summer on some class, but I can't pull falsehoods out of a hat like a magician.
[03:34:01] <MetaNova> me: oh, I know! the internet will agree with me!
[03:34:04] <MetaNova> the internet: no
[03:34:36] <tinwhiskers> entitled — Verb: 1. simple past tense and past participle of entitle, — Adjective: 1. (common misunderstanding) having a title., 2. having a legal or perceived moral right or claim to something., 3....

[03:35:37] <MetaNova> how much deeper of a hole do you think he would have dug if we had told him he was correct?
[03:35:43] <tinwhiskers> heh
[03:36:06] <LjL> to be fair "entitled" in the title sense is not idiomatic to me, but i'm not a native speaker which means that sometimes things that are reasonable in common usage but not quite *common* miss my radar
[03:36:17] <tinwhiskers> agreed
[03:36:22] <LjL> reasonably*
[03:36:47] <raccoon_dog> Well, there are people -- the more snobbish kind -- who insist it isn't correct usage. Which is what that Merriam-Webster article is about.
[03:37:09] <LjL> it's funny though because we say "intitolato" quite commonly in italian which is the same morphological construction as "entitled"
[03:37:18] <LjL> but in english i'd say "titled" or just a phrase with "the title is"

[03:37:24] <raccoon_dog> But those do tend to be the same people who insist you cannot split infinitives and can't use "hopefully" to mean "we hope; I hope; it is hoped."
[03:37:37] <raccoon_dog> And I tend to ignore strict prescriptivists like that.
[03:37:41] <LjL> uh
[03:38:15] <raccoon_dog> LjL: Yeah, "titled" is also correct in that context.
[03:38:15] <tinwhiskers> LjL: what about in the case of something like: A new paper published by LjL, entitled "Where does it hurt?"
[03:38:24] <LjL> when is "hopefully" *not* used that way? when some italian like me but who hasn't been whacked enough time thinks that since it doesn't quite exist in italian, it must literally mean "in a way that is hopeful"?

[03:39:03] <raccoon_dog> Which is the reason this article exists.
[03:39:17] <LjL> tinwhiskers, in that sort of case, i think it sounds formal enough that i would feel uneasy saying "titled", i *might* feel an itch to scratch about "entitled" and then i'd check the dictionary, or i'd cheat and go "by the title of"
[03:39:28] <LjL> raccoon_dog, it hopefully convinces the reader
[03:39:41] <raccoon_dog> Badum tss.
[03:39:55] <LjL> oh well i see they did it themselves with "thankfully" in the sub-title
[03:40:15] <raccoon_dog> Yeah. They're a bunch of comedians up at M-W, apparently.
[03:41:49] <raccoon_dog> I guess some linguists and grammarians may consider "entitled" a "skunked" word.

[19:33:15] <TechTest> pussipupu: maybe they are just getting offended if I say "hello" to them 
[19:33:18] <pussipupu> That different people are offended by different things is certainly true, that "it's bullshit" is not obviously meaningful

[19:35:41] <pussipupu> *it's the best explanation
[19:36:03] <pussipupu> Not that I'm agreeing, just to provide you with a grammatical version
[19:36:07] <kompowiec> because it belongs to the same insignificant words as morality, should and offended exactly
[19:36:39] <kompowiec> "should" in 99% it's fallacy called is-ought problem

[19:37:07] <kompowiec> they have no logical value, so for me it's BS.
[19:37:48] <TechTest> that's the thing, there's no definition for "insulting", everyone chooses how and with what they get insulted
[19:37:51] <kompowiec> very rarely i use "should" only in conjunction with "instead of"

[19:48:09] <pussipupu> .w apologise
[19:48:11] <tinsoldier> apologise — Verb: 1. Non-Oxford British English standard spelling of apologize. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/apologise
[19:48:20] <pussipupu> Thanks Wiktionary
[19:48:23] <pussipupu> .w apologize
[19:48:24] <tinsoldier> apologize — Verb: 1. (intransitive, often followed by 'for') To make an apology or excuse; to acknowledge some fault or offense, with expression of regret for it, by way of amends, 2. (intransitive) To express regret that a certain event has occurred., 3. (intransitive, dated) To make an apologia or defense; to act as apologist. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/apologize
[19:49:07] <TechTest> are you saying "I'm sorry" and "I apologize" don't have the same meaning?
[19:49:11] * pussipupu goes to hide playing cards in the loft
[19:49:27] <pussipupu> They don't, though there's some overlap, right
[19:49:40] <TechTest> they don't?
[19:50:28] <TechTest> I thought it was just that "I'm sorry" was more informal
[19:52:44] <raccoon_dog> "I'm sorry" is more general. So, you could express your condolences at a funeral by saying "I'm sorry."
[19:53:28] <raccoon_dog> But unless you were the murderer or something, you would NOT say "I apologize" at the funeral. Because this is used to acknowledge that you did something wrong.
[19:54:07] <TechTest> but you'd still use "I'm sorry" for something you did wrong
[19:54:21] <raccoon_dog> Right -- that's the 'overlap' that was mentioned before.
[19:54:29] <TechTest> ah right
[19:55:17] <TechTest> so in the context "I'm sorry for *something I didn't do wrong*"
[19:55:43] <TechTest> is "I'm sorry" just an expression of sympathy?
[19:56:24] <kompowiec> repentance i guess
[19:57:03] <nalkri> It can be sympathy or repentance(or both)
[19:57:38] <raccoon_dog> No, not "repentance" in this case -- "repentance" is, again, for when you did something wrong and wish to express regret. "Repentance" also has more religious overtones.
[19:58:03] <nalkri> And “sorry” can be used to express that
[19:58:21] <nalkri> I'm not talking about your specific example, just the word in general
[20:01:18] <DevAntoine> pussipupu: so you're saying that "expiration date" is correct while "expiring date" is not or that they don't have the same meaning? 
[20:01:49] <nalkri> “expiring date” in isolation(as a noun phrase) doesn't really work
[20:01:54] <nalkri> So both :þ
[20:02:40] <nalkri> If it did have a meaning, it'd likely be “a day for expiring things” so maybe the day the dates are checked and things are thrown out
[20:05:16] <raccoon_dog> I was very confused why nalkri was answering something asked to pussipupu.
[20:05:21] <raccoon_dog> And I just /whoised and found out why. lol
[20:05:25] <raccoon_dog> All this time, that was nalkri.
[20:05:35] <nalkri> It's not like it's a secret, I'm always logged in :þ
[20:05:56] <nalkri> Pussipupu is my Matrix bridge account, nalkri is me directly from an IRC client
[20:05:56] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, I mean, I don't obsessively /whois everyone. lol
[20:05:59] <nalkri> Fair
[20:06:00] <raccoon_dog> I see.
[20:07:24] <nalkri> But yeah, I do try to not switch without being explicit about it but soemtimes forget
[20:07:43] <raccoon_dog> Ah.
[20:08:55] <nalkri> I'm deeply sorry for any confusion which may have been caused.
[20:09:10] <nalkri> (That one can reasonably be interpreted as an apology :D)
