[04:30:32] <alphapapa[m]> I seem to recall recently discovering a trick for adding to a hook a function that removes itself from the hook when it's run, but I forget the details.  Anyone know what I'm thinking of?
[04:30:59] <alphapapa[m]> Specifically, adding a lambda to a hook rather than a named function
[04:32:01] *** Quits: agentofuser (~agentofus@191.184.206.193) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:32:04] <bpalmer> No immediate tricks come to mind, although xemacs's add-one-shot-hook added a wrapper that would create a self-reference to remove itself.
[04:32:20] <bpalmer> so that's the approach I would probably take.
[04:32:21] <alphapapa[m]> That sounds very useful
[04:33:10] <bpalmer> straightforward to do with gensym, even without lexical binding.

[04:33:42] <alphapapa[m]> Oh, gen a sym and set its function value?
[04:34:07] <bpalmer> Yes. Set its function value to a lambda that then calls remove-hook to remove that gensym
[04:34:32] <alphapapa[m]> Thanks, that might be the clever solution I was looking for, trying to get a lambda to refer to itself
[04:36:11] <bpalmer> E.g., if you can rely on lexical binding, (defun add-one-shot-hook (hook function &optional depth local) (let* ((s (gensym "oneshot-")) (l (lambda () (funcall function) (remove-hook hook s))) (fset s l) (add-hook hook s depth local))))

[04:40:25] <bpalmer> To preserve that semantic, you need to explicitly check for that behavior, because otherwise you're creating a new lambda each time.
[04:41:04] <alphapapa[m]> In my case, I am making a unique lambda each time, and more than one of them could be present in the hook
[04:41:26] <bpalmer> then the lambdas shouldn't eq one another, and this check shouldn't fire.

[13:56:45] <bpalmer> why do you think after-change-functions isn't invoked when the buffer isn't current?

[13:57:09] <bpalmer> (I don't know that it does, but how did you test?)
[13:58:21] <skykanin> The docs say so
[13:58:47] <skykanin> "The buffer that has been changed is always the current buffer when the function is called." https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Change-Hooks.html
[13:59:54] <bpalmer> Right. So if a buffer changes that isn't current, it is made current and then the functions are called, and then it switches back for more human interaction.
[13:59:58] *** Joins: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace)
[14:00:18] <bpalmer> At least, that too is consistent with the docs. (And I'm fairly sure of that behavior; but a test may prove useful)
[14:01:21] <bpalmer> because the buffer is not passed in to the function as an argument, this is the way it has to work so the functions know what buffer they're being called from.

The contents of these two buffers change as each line in my source code file is being exectued. I was hoping to save the output showing up in these two buffers under current line as comment.
[16:16:43] <famubu>  Is there something like that is out there already?

[22:09:05] *** Quits: gnoo (~gnoo@user/gnoo) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[22:09:55] <wasamasa> if yes, then the elisp would do your typical line loop, track beginning of line, search for the timestamp up till the end of line and if there is a match, extract the substring from line beginning to match beginning
[22:10:00] <wasamasa> otherwise grab the full line
[22:10:06] <corwin> Think of the regex engine as like a "mini emacs", that will do some very specific jumping around and asserting the text does or doesn't contain what you want.  With elisp you can do anything you can do with regex matching by inspecting buffer content around point, and you can have variables and such so that the effect is rather more powerful than a single express that describes whatever sized block of text it encounters.
[22:10:15] <wasamasa> expressing that in terms of regex is doable, but super complicated
[22:10:50] <corwin> ^  whereas emacs has functionality literally built to make it.. easier.

[23:29:41] <makomo> how do people get nice indentation of if in emacs-lisp- and common-lisp-mode? it seems that emacs' lisp-indent-function is very basic and can't even indent forms such as flet, cl-flet, cl-labels, etc., which requires you to resort to common-lisp-indent-function. but once you switch, "if" isn't indented according to elisp standards anymore

[23:31:51] <fengshaun> acdw, it's a mess!
[23:32:11] <rpav> though i haven't used CL in a bit now so i'm not sure what all the cool kids are doing these days
[23:32:24] <makomo> rpav: yeah, i do use slime for cl, but what am i supposed to use for elisp though?
[23:32:25] *** Joins: fossdd (~fossdd@sourcehut/user/fossdd)
[23:32:53] <acdw> that's the real question
[23:32:54] <makomo> elisp's default lisp-indent-function doesn't know how to indent cl-labels, cl-flet, etc. i don't understand how the maintainers do it then?
[23:33:11] <acdw> (sorry fengshaun I meant to ^ on makomo's thing wiht lisp-indent-function)
[23:33:18] <rpav> makomo: for your own stuff i think there is a (declare) or somesuch for helping with indendation, but otherwise i dunno, it's pretty annoying
[23:33:22] <makomo> acdw: aha, i thought you did, but they replied so i was confused :D
[23:33:23] <acdw> i've not even tried wsl2 b/c i've heard it's such a clusterfuck
[23:33:27] *** Joins: sakalli (~user@88-115-213-158.elisa-laajakaista.fi)
[23:33:34] <acdw> oh lol yeah
[23:33:37] <makomo> :')
[23:34:00] <makomo> rpav: yeah, there's an (indent n) declaration, but it again has the functionality of lisp-indent-function -- very basic and not good enough
[23:34:05] <acdw> if you /do/ find anything i'd be very interested. i think i tried just setting the lisp-indent-function to common-lisp-indent-function or w/e
[23:34:12] <acdw> but yeah, then if is funky
[23:34:27] <rpav> makomo: it would rock if they had the custom indenting stuff from slime no doubt, one big thing i've missed
[23:34:31] <rpav> though fairly rare to encounter an issue
[23:34:40] <makomo> that's what i just did, but the thing is that common-lisp-indent-function looks up the indentation for an operator from the symbol's common-lisp-indent-function property
[23:34:45] <makomo> (replying to acdw)
[23:35:17] <makomo> and e.g. cl-labels, cl-flet, etc. don't have that property set by default, so you have to copy them over from their non-cl- equivalents
[23:35:26] <acdw> ohhhh boo
[23:35:30] <makomo> which is fine. just one more sexp in my init.el :)
[23:35:37] <makomo> but i don't understand how to do it for if
[23:35:41] <acdw> sounds like a package coming onnnn
[23:36:02] <makomo> because i need to be able to differentiate whether i'm in elisp or cl mode to be able to tell whether to indent it in elisp or cl style
[23:36:13] <makomo> a single common-lisp-indent-function doesn't cut it
[23:36:24] <makomo> a single common-lisp-indent-function property*
[23:36:57] <acdw> https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=9622 ...
[23:37:13] <makomo> yep LOL

[23:38:11] <makomo> hmmmm wait, i think i can make it work actually. the particular property can also be a function which is called to indent the operator. within that function i can check if i'm in elisp or cl... :)
[23:38:20] <makomo> or i can try :D
[23:38:34] <acdw> good luck! def i'd install that package if you mad eit

[23:39:05] <makomo> acdw: have you tried the cl-indent package, btw?
[23:39:23] <sakalli> Hello, everyone. So, if I install emacs-git on arch, does that mean it's using native compilation because it's the master branch and 28? or is it something that needs to be checked if the package has set the option while compiling?
[23:39:39] <makomo> slime has a heavily patched fork of cl-indentation that throws away certain elisp stuff, but it seems that the standard cl-indentation has provisions for indenting cl- symbols
[23:39:53] <makomo> of cl-indent*
[23:41:59] <makomo> acdw: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-indent.el#L334
[23:42:13] <makomo> and also for if https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-indent.el#L831
[23:42:47] <makomo> hmm, seems like this should work actually. it might be that slime-indentation is just overwriting the definitions with its patched version of cl-indent
[23:45:20] <sakalli> nm, according to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/emacs "emacs-gitAUR: Development branch of GNU Emacs. As of June 2021, it includes support for native compilation merged from the Emacs' branch feature/native-comp."
