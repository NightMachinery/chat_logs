[02:25:26] <Kexoni> could it be a problem, that it is MBR?
[02:25:54] <Aarch64debian> !gpt
[02:25:54] <ubottu> GPT is a partition table format. It is required to boot EFI. See also !efi
[02:26:16] <Aarch64debian> !efi
[02:26:16] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[02:27:39] <Kexoni> ok, I will convert now and try new install

[02:51:06] <tomreyn> So if Kexoni makes it back to the point where they run into a black screen during boot, I suppose they should try to boot [ test_case_1: to the advanced -> recovery grub menu entry ] and [ test_case_2: *without* linux command line options    quiet splash     and *with*    debug systemd.log_level=info mtrr_spare_reg_nr=1 mtrr_gran_size=64M mtrr_chunk_size=128M    ]
[02:52:30] *** Joins: Kexoni (~Kexoni@user/kexoni)
[02:53:01] <Kexoni> like EriC^^ told, changing to GPT didn't changed anything
[02:53:02] <tomreyn> if recovery works, the normal boot record should boot with additional kernel command line option      dis_ucode_ldr      and it's an early CPU microcode update issue. if the latter helps, it's a needed workaround to the hybrid graphics setup and a bad bios.
[02:54:56] <tomreyn> Kexoni: unrelated to this, you may want to read https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2021/12/30/%23ubuntu.html later, searching for (substring) "test_case"

[04:20:16] <MsSmith> i guess im just confused why 2&1 the redirection part comes at the end of the statement
[04:20:21] <MsSmith> wouldnt that mean its executed last?
[04:20:32] <MsSmith> after the command >> file.txt is written to the file?
[04:21:59] *** Quits: jeffmr (~jeffmr@50.83.36.201) (Client Quit)
[04:22:22] <MsSmith> I assume code is executed left to right
[04:24:22] <MsSmith> bash command 2>>&1 result.txt  would make more sense to me than bash command >> result.txt 2>>&1

[10:38:08] <ubottu> A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery).

[10:41:37] <melvinga> that's right ubottu and thanks for pasting the summary of it.
[10:41:46] <melvinga> I find a larger issue there. Ubuntu 18.04 has latest apache available through apt, and that's apache 2.4.29 (released Oct 2017).
[10:41:56] <melvinga> Thought I'd contribute with providing newer versions of apache through apt in a timely manner. Would you know whom I should get in touch with to understand how I can contribute?

I just installed a fresh Ubuntu 20 on sda which replaced my grub boot loader with the new one that doesn’t detect my LUKS volume. I am on the new SDA Ubuntu. How can I switch

[15:58:38] <webchat98> i just followed tutorial didnt work
[15:58:52] <webchat98> i mounted, chroot, and re install grub on encrypted device
[15:58:54] <webchat98> rebooted

[15:59:25] <webchat98> what can  i do to get my grub back to normal
[15:59:49] <KBar> webchat98: Ubuntu 20.04 or 20.10?
[15:59:51] <webchat98> all my important documents are here
[15:59:52] <webchat98> 20.04
[16:00:24] <webchat98> i have a sdb2 which is /boot with efi and images etc
[16:00:28] <ramblebamble> webchat98 usually you will have to configure grub to load luks when booting,the good news is that your data is not lost, just not accessible, you can mount the system in a live-cd or your other system and reinstall grub
[16:00:30] <webchat98> and sdb3 which is my encyrpted data
[16:00:34] <KBar> Well, not a great way to end 2021, that's for sure.
[16:01:22] <webchat98> ramblebamble i am looking at my data it is mounted and available anmd so is sdb2 /boot
[16:01:30] <webchat98> i have mounted sdb3 and sdb2
[16:01:41] <webchat98> i need grub installed on sdb2 and to detect luks
[16:02:02] <webchat98> i have spent hours and 100 google searches

[16:06:03] <ramblebamble> but you will find what you are looking for here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt specifically this part https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/System_configuration#Boot_loader
[16:06:06] <ksy> maybe you'd better mount your system on a live-cd and copy the important data to a safe place first
[16:06:12] <ramblebamble> It is arch, but the underlying system is still Linux
[16:06:41] <ramblebamble> or you can do as ksy suggests

[16:11:14] <ramblebamble> and then continue with the bootloader configuration
[16:11:28] <webchat98> what about /dev/sdb2
[16:11:49] <webchat98> oh for fucks sake
[16:11:53] <webchat98> it is over written

[16:12:32] <webchat98> maybe that is the problem
[16:12:42] <webchat98> it was ext4 and grub would pick it up google said it had to be fat
[16:12:49] <webchat98> so i changed it to fat but it formatted

[16:28:49] <jjakob> but generally every os should have grub with os-prober, which should detect the os on the other drive and make a boot option for it, but the other drive's luks must be opened and mounted, so that it can detect it
[16:30:06] <jjakob> which is why I don't do separate drives or luks volumes any more, but use just one drive with one luks volume spanning the whole drive and then put lvm on it and all the os's and partitions into lvm
[16:30:45] <jjakob> no matter into which os you boot it should have unlocked the luks+lvm that holds all the other os's

[19:51:49] <EriC^^> doesn't matter, might as well chroot then run 'mount /boot' to test if its working with fstab

[19:53:44] <EriC^^> ah right, type mkdir /boot/efi
[19:53:45] <nuxer> ok so I managed to get into the terminal login via esc on boot, but even after editing grub and updating it with the default CMDLINE pointing to "text" it still goes to the damn xwindow manager and hence paralyses the keyboard and mouse (the kb and mouse DO work when I press esc and boot into safe/recovery mode)
[19:54:09] <nuxer> in other words, what do I need to put where to stop ubuntu impish from booting into xwindow
[19:54:44] <webchat36> now do i install with apt
[19:54:55] <EriC^^> yeah
[19:54:56] <nuxer> I'm still going to check that avenue if I can get things to work via terminal since it works in safe mode thatway

[22:41:22] <webchat64> How do I install the audio driver for  Realtek I2S Audio
[22:42:15] <webchat64> I installed 20.04 on my rca cambio tablet.   I used the linixium image because it had 32bit efi, and everything worked but I had no audio.
[22:43:17] <webchat64> I looked up others who might have the problem with this device and it needs this Realtek I2S Audio driver, but this was not installed even though I have enabled non-free software.
