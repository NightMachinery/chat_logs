[00:15:43] <FromDiscord> <tandy> im trying at the moment but xml is quite different to json

[00:16:42] <FromDiscord> <tandy> things like these are the hard parts
[00:17:12] <FromDiscord> <tandy> like i could use a generic name like key and value? then make a jsony posthook to put in the real names
[00:21:37] <FromDiscord> <tandy> i guess that could be link\: seq[seq[(string, string)]]
[00:21:50] <FromDiscord> <tandy> i guess that could be `link: seq[seq[(string, string)]]`
[00:22:21] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> probably don't need the nested seqs right?
[00:22:41] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> like `link: seq[(string, string)]` should be fine too
[00:23:13] <FromDiscord> <tandy> oh true
[00:24:13] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> I just checked, if the JSON has duplicate keys the 2nd occurrence will overwrite the 1st occurrence
[00:24:17] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> in Nim at least
[00:24:57] <FromDiscord> <exelotl> so probably better to stick to the XML format if that's something you think is likely to happen
[00:29:35] <FromDiscord> <tandy> yeah, im going to try describing the xspf type, but jspf should work as json↵(@exelotl)

[01:39:02] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I'm still trying to solve this issue where I have a {.cdecl.} callback, and I want to interact with one of my objects inside of that callback. Anyone have insight as to how I could handle this?
[01:39:42] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Short of creating a global mapping of ids or something to my objects, I'm out of ideas
[01:40:49] <nrds> <06Prestige99> The part of my code: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3BLM
[01:41:38] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Use the body to get a reference to the object

[01:50:15] <nrds> <06Prestige99> oh interesting, didn't know about that; thanks
[01:50:55] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I suppose this.unsafeAddr would do the trick..

[01:53:51] <nrds> <06Prestige99> thank you!
[01:54:16] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> For what you're doing though, you may as well just iterate though all your objects after stepping
[01:54:34] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Rather than adding callbacks to the physics code for every update
[01:55:03] <nrds> <06Prestige99> oh this is just assigning a callback for the velocityUpdateFunc
[01:55:24] <nrds> <06Prestige99> for a particular body
[01:56:38] <nrds> <06Prestige99> calling cpBodySetVelocityUpdateFunc
[01:57:46] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Hmmmm ok, i don't really understand your use case. But I'm not sure why you'd use velocityupdatefunc
[01:58:51] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I was told that the velocityupdatefunc is called after the physics resolution instead of before, so e.g. if you wanted to cap the velocity, you should do it in the velocityupdatefunc
[01:59:14] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I haven't verified it though, just what I was told by another chipmunk user. Maybe I should go read through the code
[02:00:39] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Ok that may be the case, but you probably only want to assign it once
[02:01:43] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Yeah that's what this function does, it's just for assignment
[02:02:01] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I don't think I'll care if the user calls it more than once though, it'd just replace the callback with a new one
[02:02:59] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Ok
[02:03:23] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Does the userdata thing do what you want?

[15:16:59] <FromDiscord> <Rika> That’s hilarious

[15:20:53] <FromDiscord> <MrOkram> Tbh, it still works, and it can do it's job, i'll just have to limit the port range to the one i need, not let it do a full port scan

[22:47:28] <FromDiscord> <reilly> Neither `EnumName.EnumField` nor `module.EnumName.EnumField` work. Both fail to compile because, if I'm interpreting the message correctly, it's trying to treat `EnumName` like an object, and it doesn't have any field named `EnumField`.
