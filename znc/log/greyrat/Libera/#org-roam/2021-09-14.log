[07:05:19] <rdrg109> This is a picky question,  but I'm giving it a try: I'm storing node metadata in X properties. For example, for those notes that implies the usage of a programming languaeg, I"m using the :PROGRAMMING_LANUAGE: property, so that I can then list all the nodes where python was used.
[07:06:13] <rdrg109> My question is: Does Org Roam suport querying nodes with any property?
[07:17:54] <lockywolf> I think, org-ql is fairly nice for parsing org. Not sure how well it integrates with roam.
[08:48:09] <rdrg109> lockywolf: Thanks! will look into that
