[00:44:03] <la_croix_> I'm trying to add a custom database type to postgres, along with a custom ModelField. I've defined a custom migration to create the field, and subclassed the db wrapper to extend the data_types dict, to map the ModelField to the db type. Is this the correct approach?

[00:46:37] <FunkyBob> la_croix_: does it really require a whole custom DB adapter?
[00:46:50] <FunkyBob> am fairly sure other libs have added new field types without that
[00:47:01] <FunkyBob> [of course, it depends on how deeply it requires integration]
[00:48:43] *** Quits: sidj (~sidj@user/sidj) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:49:33] <la_croix_> FunkyBob: well, it's only two lines. The main reason that I'm here (which possibly answers your last comment!) is that I need it to format `where` clauses differently, specifically, instead of "%s". I need "%s::customtype". I managed to cast the lhs by subclassing DatabaseOperations, but I can't cast the rhs
[00:51:29] <FunkyBob> so... which PG type are you trying to add support for?
[00:51:33] <la_croix_> And without subclassing the adapter, I'm not sure how django would understand that my CustomType(Field) should map to the custom_type db field
[00:52:23] <la_croix_> It's a custom composite type, defined as `CREATE TYPE CustomType as (foo int, bar int, baz int)`
[00:52:25] <FunkyBob> the field itself should contain that infomration
[00:52:32] <FunkyBob> AIUI
[00:53:46] <la_croix_> Oh, on the db_type function. That makes sense. I'll give it a go

[01:03:01] <schinckel> You just need to register the composite type so psycogp2 knows how to convert it - and maybe add an adapter so it can convert from the python type to postgres.
[01:03:21] <schinckel> I'm taking my kids to school now - can chat to you about it later.
[01:04:16] <schinckel> I did plan to release my composite field handling stuff - but the sticky bit is around migrations.
[01:05:02] <schinckel> More recently I dealt with this by defining a model that is the composite type and using the fact postgres creates types for every table.
[01:05:53] <schinckel> Oh, they left.

[01:09:36] <la_croix_> FunkyBob: You were right, of course, specifying the db_type works fine for the custom type. Do you know how to specify the casting for `where` clauses? I overrode field_cast_sql on the DatabaseOperations class, but that added the casting to the LHS, not the RHS.
[01:10:12] <la_croix_> Specifically for this field, I need `where COLUMN = %s` to come out as `where COLUMN = %s::custom_type`

[02:08:42] <schinckel> la_croix_: I'm currently registering the composite type using the `connection_created` signal. I hit the database to do this, because you need to get the OID of the type.
[02:09:04] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[02:10:16] <la_croix_> schinckel: Is it possible to skip that and just create the type in a migration (since I've already done that?)
[02:10:29] <la_croix_> (manual migration)
[02:10:35] <schinckel> Yeah, I do that.
[02:11:14] *** Joins: mimmy (~mimmy@72.142.88.18)
[02:11:31] <schinckel> But you still need to register the type.
[02:11:43] <schinckel> If you can get the OID it is possible to do it without hitting the db.
[02:11:52] <schinckel> But the OID can change if you run it on a new db.
[02:13:26] <schinckel> With the extensions I was doing to support multirange types I grabbed the OIDs of the existing types (ie, datemultirange, etc), and put that into code, but custom types always have a db-dependent OID.
[02:13:36] <la_croix_> Ok, understood, no, hitting the db is fine
[02:14:20] <schinckel> I actually do a thing where I do a `SELECT NULL::composite_type` to see if the type exists - but I think that's a bit dirty.
[02:14:34] <schinckel> (That is a way to get a bunch of OIDs though)
[02:15:09] <schinckel> You could stick the OID for a type in an environment variable - but then if you have multiple databases the OID could differ.
[02:15:37] <la_croix_> Makes sense, but no, registering the type is fine

[02:16:07] <rconan> so this might be completely crazy... but I'm wondering if there's any way to migrate the primary key on my custom User model from using IntegerField to using UUIDField, given that I have third-party apps referencing this via a swappable dependency. The issue, as I see it, is that I would need to inject a temporary, additional field into the third-party app's table in order to hold the UUID while
[02:16:09] <rconan> the migration occurs
[02:16:39] <schinckel> It's probably possible, but could be messy.
[02:17:21] *** Joins: Matthias1 (~Matthias1@casewireless11.CWRU.Edu)
[02:17:33] <la_croix_> schinckel: This is looking promising - I'll hack away on it, and report back later. Thank you so much!
[02:19:08] <rconan> so I looked at two options for doing it... one was to just use RunSQL to do the required migrations on the third-party app's tables, for this I fell foul of not being able to easily predict the names of all the constraints on the table, the other was trying to use the schema_editor to inject an additional field in a RunPython, which just seemed really nasty
[02:19:53] <schinckel> rconan: You should be able to name your constraints.
[02:20:00] <rconan> notably, I think you don't really have access to a mutable ModelState for the model
[02:20:47] <rconan> they seem to have something that looks at least a bit random in them...  I suppose it could be some kind of hash
[02:21:13] <schinckel> When doing things that are _really_ tricky, I've been known to subclass django migration operations and make the database_forwards do nothing, and write the SQL manually.
[02:21:40] <schinckel> That way you can just change the models to match, generate the migrations, and replace the classes they use.
[02:21:47] <schinckel> Then django is happy, and it moves the problem to SQL
[02:22:06] <rconan> I'm wondering if all this is "not worth it" though, and I should just tolerate that this model will forever have an id that's an IntegerField and an additional UUID for places where I care about enumerability
[02:22:41] <schinckel> That's what we do - we add an additional UUID field when we need to expose it as a value without showing our users how many of a given thing we have.

This works perfectly in runserver, perfectly in shell, but the adapter does not get called in pytest (I've put a breakpoint in, and the __init__ method is called as normal, it just doesn't adapt the type when data is pulled from the db)

[18:54:04] <VaniaPy> Hello friends, i want to make a simple question-answer app with static answers and questions, i have built this one https://dpaste.org/fdAw
[18:54:17] <VaniaPy> is there a better way to optimize it?
[18:54:59] <VaniaPy> i mean, should i query the questions from the db? i don't need to store the answers btw
[19:00:09] <GinFuyou> if questions are static, using db is not optimal
[19:00:28] <GinFuyou> result calculation on other side is awkward
[19:04:18] <VaniaPy> GinFuyou i know,but i'm just doing what i'm told to do so :P  Regarding the models,then as i understand are not mandatory as well

[19:27:40] <LordKalma> VaniaPy, you could model the data differently, like, even without a database you could hae
[19:28:29] <LordKalma> [{"question": "bla?", "answers": ["ans1", ...], "correct_idx": 0}, ...]
[19:28:49] <LordKalma> which would simplify things
[19:32:20] <LordKalma> instead of those hardcoded `elif question == "Once used ..." and data['answer']  == "Yes"`
[19:32:39] <LordKalma> I still would use a DB though, even with a performance penalty, the fact you get django admin for free is amaziiiing

[22:20:36] <BinarySavior> hi, when using django ORM, and more broadly, ORM in general, are there any downfalls as opposed to constructing the DB using SQL?

[22:24:44] <dminuoso> BinarySavior: Depends on who you ask.
[22:25:06] <dminuoso> I personally greatly dislike ORMs because they force a non-working poorly documented mental model on you, where its hard to figure out how to achieve something.
[22:25:22] <dminuoso> For non-trivial queries you usually end up spending so much time figuring out how to make the ORM generate the exact SQL query you have in mind
[22:26:11] <dminuoso> Or the ORM generates poor queries and you cant do much about it. And furthermore, because ORM tend to provide multi-step processes, developers frequently spread code that influences SQL generation across many places
[22:26:27] <BinarySavior> interesting, i could definitely identify with that
[22:28:33] <dminuoso> Plus, SQL knowledge is portable irrespective of what programming language you work in, even odd management tasks or consulting the database directly can all be done in the same language.
[22:29:00] *** Quits: mimmy (~mimmy@146.70.75.158) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:29:10] <dminuoso> Side note: I happen to work in problem domains with fairly limited numbers of tables, so writing raw SQL and providing simple handwritten object manager style interfaces is quite feasible for us.

[22:30:11] <bss> and I greatly appreciate ORMs for the abstraction they provide, especially when working with healthy catalogs of models, especially when those models are designed coherently
