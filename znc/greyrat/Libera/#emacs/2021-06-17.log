[01:52:23] <roto> I think Andrea Corallo has proposed a namespaces thing?
[01:52:35] <wasamasa> indeed
[01:52:47] <wasamasa> but I suspect it to be more of a political than technical issue
[01:53:08] <roto> rudybot: we need to fork!
[01:53:10] <wasamasa> considering the argument "grep doesn't work with namespaces" has been made successfully
[01:53:10] <rudybot> roto: let's be honest, for a fork to work we need more quotemstr's
[01:53:42] <edgar-rft> rudybot: we need to torch and pitchfork!

[08:36:30] <johnjay> aidalgol: ah good point.
[08:36:36] <johnjay> yeah basically.

[08:40:12] <bkhl> https://www.geany.org/documentation/screenshots/
[08:41:23] <aidalgol> VSCode is one of the few "modern" IDEs/editors that gets this right.  It doesn't have a toolbar, and instead stole M-x from Emacs.
[08:41:24] <bkhl> Or I'd like a programmable Geany I guess.
[08:41:45] <bkhl> Yeah, but it still uses graphics for the project explorer and things like that.
[08:42:00] <bkhl> I know you _can_ do things like that in Emacs, but it tends to end up flaky with everything having to be a buffer.

[11:49:59] <codingquark> kensanata: recently I was searching for your replies regarding cameras, and then realised you delete your old data regularly. Neat approach!
[11:50:05] <wasamasa> I've been doing some scheme hacking to revamp my blog
[11:50:12] <wasamasa> because I got annoyed at rebuild times being too long
[11:50:16] <wasamasa> half a second per blog post
[11:50:34] <wasamasa> and that might break readability
[11:52:04] <kensanata> codingquark: You mean on Mastodon? Yeah. I do keep a local archive, though. So if there's something you want me to dig up, I can probably find it. If you don't care for a local archive, the online service "forget" https://forget.codl.fr/about/ is probably a good starting point.
[11:53:30] <codingquark> kensanata: oh, you have a local archive! Well, this is not very important, but if you get time, could you dig up our discussion about cameras? I had asked for cam suggestions some time ago and you had helped.
[11:55:46] <kensanata> codingquark: "2019-01-18 I bought an Olympus with a 17mm lens and I’m still very happy with it. It is a little extra bag to carry, not quite pocket ready. But it’s great for trips, holidays."
[11:56:22] <kensanata> codingquark: Although these days I'd say my phone's camera does all the scenery and flower pictures I need. All the pictures I post on Mastodon are iPhone 11 pictures, for example.

That was back when all you had was dialup and it was faster to get a floppy from someone and FTP was all but nonexistant. I think this is part of why documents such as the emacs manuals are proprietary.

[16:18:04] <twb> vscode in theory doesn't, but I wouldn't bet on it
[16:18:13] <twb> wgreenhouse: that's a common problem
[16:18:20] <danrobi70> vscode, atom uses to much ram. Emacs uses barely any
[16:18:23] <twb> wgreenhouse: most terminal emulators have an option to reduce blink rate to save battery
[16:18:23] <empwilli_> I'm just speaking from first hand expierence, I tried to profile it some times but still
[16:18:38] <twb> wgreenhouse: since e.g. 1Hz blink requires waking up the GPU once per second
[16:18:59] <empwilli_> This was not intended as an editor vs. editor by any means, I'm quite happy with my setup but still. this is the one thing
[16:19:01] <twb> wgreenhouse: it shouldn't affect the *CPU* tho
[16:19:32] <wgreenhouse> twb: vscode was implementing it as a css animation, so it woke CPU too
[16:19:44] <empwilli_> however I hang around with a lot of guys with "non standard" setups (tiling windowmangers and so on) and there is no setup that has not sth. that's strangely broken... so probably that's just similar :D

[22:55:39] <johnjay> by the way emacs often feels sluggish, i think the 100ms barrier is why
[22:55:55] <johnjay> some actions probably take longer than 100ms or at least feel that way
[22:56:09] <johnjay> wasamasa might know more about this since he did that chip8 thing
[22:56:10] <dale> rdrg109: ((lambda (x) (1+ x)) 42) works, apply works, funcall works.
[22:56:14] <johnjay> but idk if ti's all redisplay
[22:56:48] <wasamasa> explain-pause-mode helps with identifying the durations of these blocking things in emacs
[22:56:57] <wasamasa> but unfortunately the author lost interest in fixing the bugs
[22:57:08] <johnjay> I suppose emacs UI could be improved just by having a spinner appear while starting it if you have multiple el files to load
[22:57:32] <dale> rdrg109: Note that ((lambda ...) ...) works but (let ((f (lambda ...))) (f ...)) does not, because in the latter case you've found the lambda to the value slot of f, but (f ...) looks up the function in the symbol slot of f, which is presumably empty.
[22:57:48] <dale> rdrg109: s/found/bound/

[22:58:27] <johnjay> dale: there's no slet or flet? i thought there was something like that
[22:58:46] <dale> johnjay: There's stuff like cl-labels.

[22:59:27] <dale> I think cl-flet is the one you're not supposed to use because it got screwed up in the past, and now letf is the thing to use?  Maybe I have that backwards.
[22:59:33] <johnjay> wasamasa: this is some kind of advanced profiler right? it looks amazing!
[22:59:52] <wasamasa> yeah, it is
[23:00:06] <wasamasa> I've identified an issue with circe using it that bugged me for the longest time
[23:01:23] <bpalmer> cl-flet was hacked around from flet so that cl-flet works "lexically"
[23:01:31] *** Joins: dah00pl3 (~user@rrcs-74-62-93-191.west.biz.rr.com)
[23:02:32] <bpalmer> most of the time when you use flet , imo, you want to affect the dynamic binding; the new idiom is supposed to be (letf ((symbol-function 'f) ...) ...) but I think it's both ugly and , much like cl-prefixes, rewarding bad decisions
[23:02:35] <bpalmer> so I use flet

[23:43:32] <wasamasa> emacs is generally not so good at doing smart things with multiple windows
[23:43:58] <wasamasa> I think I've seen such a thing for ERC with speedbar
[23:44:09] <wasamasa> shouldn't be too hard to adapt that for circe
[23:44:42] *** Quits: stevoooo (~user@86.12.208.56) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:44:53] <rpav> it's funny because the "hard" part of doing all the work with multiple buffers etc is easy
[23:45:02] <rpav> getting windows to behave right is a huge pita
[23:45:29] <wasamasa> if you don't care about coordinating them, it's not a problem
[23:45:44] <rpav> heh
[23:45:56] <wasamasa> so suppose you have a chat open and a window with its nicks
[23:46:11] <wasamasa> what happens if you press C-c C-SPC to switch to the next active chat?
[23:46:19] <wasamasa> what if you switch buffers with ivy?
[23:46:29] <rdrg109> johnjay, dale: Thanks for the help! Using funcall solved my issue.
[23:46:29] <wasamasa> what if you split buffers and view a second chat?
[23:46:49] <rpav> pretty sure you can hook on changing the focused window
[23:46:58] <wasamasa> yeah, but it sucks
[23:47:03] <wasamasa> what if I open a help buffer
[23:47:16] <wasamasa> should I just not update until a circe buffer is focused?
[23:47:24] <rpav> that part is sortof easier than actually saving and getting the window and mucking with it and then hoping it doesn't blow up the layout/resize/jump to somewhere you don't want
[23:47:55] <rpav> or "well you _asked_ that a window be open here, but because the window manager had another emacs window focused, it actually made one _there"
[23:48:03] <wasamasa> right
[23:48:18] <wasamasa> so I'd hope speedbar gets this right and stops working for more than one chat opened
[23:48:19] <rpav> wasamasa: those are more behavior things you have to answer and can address without a roll of the dice

I can of course search inside the current buffer, but I don't know how to do it for all the chapters of a book. I don't think nov.el provides such a functionality, but maybe I can use multi-occur opening all the chapters?
