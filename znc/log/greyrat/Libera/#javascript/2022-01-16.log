[00:03:49] <Maxdamantus> FlorianBad: you can't necessarily modify the browser's `ctx` (`CanvasRenderingContext2D`) object.
[00:04:24] *** Joins: maret (~maret@nat-88-212-37-89.antik.sk)
[00:07:01] <Maxdamantus> FlorianBad: you'd usually just pass down your own parameter, either by putting all of your drawing functions into a single class (so you can use eg `this.ctx.stroke(); this.someState += 4; this.custom();`), or if there's no shared state you'd probably just write all your functions as taking the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` object, so you'd do eg `ctx.stroke(); custom(ctx);`
[00:08:38] <Maxdamantus> and as for overlaying canvases, you can do it either way. I mentioned the overlay yesterday because if you get to the point where redrawing the entire thing is a performance concern, you can avoid redrawing the entire thing by overlaying the canvas.
[00:08:53] <Maxdamantus> but as others have mentioned, it might not be necessary.

[01:34:31] <rustyshackleford> thats a bit of duplication if you need to type out the literals twice

[01:55:58] <rustyshackleford> key is ValidKeys tells the compiler how to infer types
[01:56:09] <rustyshackleford> or what's it called... type refinement
[01:56:44] <systemfault> See that "key is ValidKeys" part? It's TypeScript magic (Type guard) that means "if the function returns true then it means that 'key' is of type ValidKeys"
[01:57:08] <systemfault> You could change that part to a boolean and you will see that "narrowing" will not happen
[01:57:16] <systemfault> Only a type guard can do that
[01:58:43] <rustyshackleford> I don't really understand this syntax either: type ValidKeys = (typeof validKeys)[number];
[01:59:40] <systemfault> Decompose it, to get the type of a variable, you can use typeof. If you do: type X = typeof validKeys; You should get "readonly ['a', 'b']"
[01:59:58] <systemfault> Then you can index that type by "key"
[02:00:13] <systemfault> If you do: type Y = X[0]; you will get 'a'

[02:09:48] <systemfault> Glad I could help :) If you use VSCode, your mouse cursor is your best friend to figure out the type of things
[02:10:13] <rustyshackleford> as const implies readonly
[02:10:28] <rustyshackleford> and it took me a while to figure out that cast to readonly string[]
[02:10:42] <rustyshackleford> systemfault: surprisingly, the playgroundd supports the same sort of hover over information
[02:10:47] <systemfault> Yeah, without the "as const", the compiler will widen the types to string[]
[02:11:14] <rustyshackleford> but you can use as const and readonly almost equivalently, right?
[02:11:42] <systemfault> Not in every case IIRC
[02:12:54] <systemfault> With readonly, you'll be forced to manually declare the type, right?
[02:13:31] <systemfault> "readonly" is part of the type declaration, as const is part of the data declaration

[05:36:28] <KevinX> It's just a tool for processing CSS files. I've written a few scripts we use to transform CSS in specific ways. You just need to understand the tool like any other

[05:42:21] <systemfault> I haven't used Tailwind and I have to admit that I'm a bit skeptical
[05:42:55] <KevinX> I wouldn't even recommend anyone to learn sass

[06:48:10] <bobdobbs> But in a few demos that I've seen, the library and scripts get called from just inside the Body tag.

[06:49:16] <bobdobbs> So I'm also wondering... is it best perhaps to provide two files? One with libs and the other with my own scripting that uses the libs I've included?
[06:50:48] <stagas> bobdobbs: use vite and forget about it :)
[06:51:02] <KevinX> it's always been a best practice to load scripts in the footer, or add the defer (or similar) attribute to the script tag.
[06:51:11] <bobdobbs> stagas: lol :)

[06:51:38] <ljharb> bobdobbs: you provide a node module.
[06:51:43] <ljharb> bobdobbs: the top-level app uses a module bundler.
[06:51:45] <ljharb> that's it
[06:52:06] <ljharb> and i wouldn't assume that demos are a pattern worth following - that's just a demo
[06:52:21] <bobdobbs> I did actually look into Vite. Decided not to use it. Something to do with it's strict way of doing things not being the way I wanted to do things.
[06:52:21] <stagas> vite and just <script src="myapp.ts"> everything else is automatic
[06:52:34] <KevinX> you can extract vendor assets, but really only needed if you update the non-vendor scripts often
[06:52:41] <stagas> thank god
[06:53:14] <bobdobbs> ljharb: You've probably watched my fumblings over the past few days. I've settled on esbuild for bundling.
[06:54:28] <bobdobbs> ljharb: so, is the idea that I (at least for my small test projects) I should just bundle everything - libs and my own script - into one file and include that as normal in the document head? Using the 'src' attribute of a script tag?
[06:54:59] <ljharb> stagas: vite does a bunch of things that break the ecosystem, i wouldn't trust it.
[06:55:05] <ljharb> bobdobbs: for an app, yes

[06:55:27] <stagas> noone even knows how to answer that question, it can only be crowdsourced by usage and vite is used by everybody at this point so it aggregates all knowledge into one correct way of doing frontend development
[06:55:31] <bobdobbs> ljharb: uhm, silly question, but how are we defining 'app' here?
[06:55:56] <ljharb> bobdobbs: a thing you deploy. versus a package, a thing you publish.
[06:56:03] <bobdobbs> ok
[06:56:07] <ljharb> stagas: lol vite is in no way "used by everybody at this point"
[06:56:20] <ljharb> stagas: and the way vite does things is objectively incorrect (somewhat, not entirely)
[06:56:23] <bobdobbs> yeah, I haven't seen vite around much. It looks pretty niche
[06:56:30] <stagas> if you're not using vite you're just wasting your time
[06:56:38] <ljharb> stagas: it's fine if you like it, but don't delude yourself into thinking it's some kind of ideal or will get massive adoption
[06:56:51] <ljharb> i would say you're wasting your time using any tool that's fundamentally broken by design
[06:57:38] <stagas> i don't know how broken it is but i know that i simply create an index.html add a script tag, do npm install vite, npx vite and my app works
[06:57:46] <stagas> that is developer experience
[06:58:20] <stagas> no fiddling with anything, not even a config file, it just works
[06:59:08] <stagas> i add sass, typescript without configuring anything, they just work
[06:59:15] <stagas> it's amazing
[06:59:20] <stagas> then i do build and it's deployable
[06:59:35] <KevinX> my money isn't on vite
[07:00:02] <ljharb> stagas: yes but just because something looks good on the surface doesn't mean it is actually good
[07:00:26] <ljharb> create-react-app had "the best DX ever", but turns out it's actually shit underneath, and eventually everyone figured that out

[07:01:43] <KevinX> I wouldn't even bet on Vue, although I like vue
[07:02:36] <stagas> you're confusing tooling with frameworks

[07:04:02] <KevinX> deno is like node
[07:04:14] <ljharb> vite is like next.js, yes
[07:04:32] <stagas> vite doesn't tell me how to structure my app, unlike next
[07:04:33] <ljharb> stagas: fundamental brokenness isn't "nuance", it's a rotten core that will always eventually collapse the structure
[07:04:45] <stagas> so next is a framework
[07:04:59] <stagas> vite is simply a bundler with everything configured
[07:05:10] <stagas> and a dev server which you're gonna need also
[07:05:19] <stagas> and basically the tooling you need for frontend
[07:05:37] <KevinX> i dont dislike vite, I just wouldn't bet on it

[07:13:16] <ljharb> stagas: especially around CJS packages
[07:13:19] <stagas> a good abstraction is one that lets you treat it like a black box, and that's what vite does. i don't care if it's building on broken principles as long as it works and it doesn't ask me to investigate its details to force it to work, which is what webpack, next.js etc have been doing

[07:17:01] <ljharb> stagas: they're not bugs. they're design flaws.
[07:17:11] <KevinX> I want to try this out too: https://alephjs.org/
[07:17:16] <ljharb> stagas: obv if it was just bugs that got fixed i wouldn't be complaining, that's just how open source works
[07:17:38] <ljharb> and whether you want to do work or not, some work shouldn't *be* abstracted away.
[07:17:41] <stagas> give me a concrete example of a design flaw in vite
[07:17:57] <stagas> that can't be fixed fundamentally
[07:18:01] <ljharb> it requires custom config for CJS packages, something around optimization or something?
[07:18:05] <ljharb> "can't" be fixed, nothing
[07:18:13] <ljharb> but they *won't* fix it. because they don't think they should.
[07:18:16] <ljharb> that's why it's a design flaw.
[07:18:23] <ljharb> webpack 5 could be fixed too, but they don't want to fix it.
[07:18:26] <stagas> is that an issue of vite, or node delaying ditching cjs
[07:18:33] <ljharb> CJS will never be ditched, ever.
[07:18:34] <ljharb> nor should it be.
[07:18:40] <ljharb> so yes, it's an issue of vite.
[07:18:52] <stagas> imo node should bump major and ditch cjs forever and let the ecosystem deal with it
[07:18:55] <ljharb> CJS and ESM are the two first-class module systems in node, forever
[07:19:02] <ljharb> then it's good you're not in charge of node, because that'll never happen
[07:19:14] <ljharb> the vast majority of useful javascript on the planet is in CJS.
[07:19:28] <ljharb> and when migrating to ESM offers zero benefits and nonzero downsides, that's going to stay the case
[07:19:39] <ljharb> ESM isn't actually better than CJS. it's just prettier syntax.
[07:19:41] <stagas> well then you're going to have node's implementation details leaking out in every other js package in the world because cjs-esm is unsolvable
[07:19:53] <ljharb> it's not unsolveable. node solved it.
[07:20:18] <ljharb> most things should stay CJS - CJS can be required or imported. things that go ESM (not that there's any benefit to doing so) can still ship CJS also, and it works fine
[07:20:30] <stagas> node is the only thing that is throwing errors in the console that this is esm or cjs and can't be used vice versa
[07:20:34] <ljharb> the only thing that's not solved is "requiring ESM"
[07:20:42] <ljharb> stagas: those errors are good and correct
[07:20:42] <stagas> why doesn't it do the right thing and stop throwing errors
[07:20:47] <stagas> like vite
[07:20:48] <ljharb> stagas: the right thing is to throw errors.
[07:20:49] <stagas> :)
[07:21:04] <ljharb> the wrong thing is to pretend that these things that *by spec can never be treated the same* can be treated the same
[07:21:25] <ljharb> this is the kind of inherent design flaw i'm talking about. building a product based on objectively incorrect and nonstandard philosophies and behaviores.
[07:21:41] <ljharb> you can't build a good tool if you think CJS is going to go away. because it'll never go away.
[07:21:55] <stagas> that's called learned helplessness
[07:22:07] <ljharb> no, it's not
[07:22:11] <ljharb> that's called being realistic
[07:22:13] <stagas> cjs can go away the same way it arrived
[07:22:17] <ljharb> "pragmatism", maybe
[07:22:20] <ljharb> CJS never can go away.
[07:22:34] <ljharb> npm is the largest repository of software on the entire planet, and it's almost entirely CJS
[07:22:43] <ljharb> that's like saying "the web can go away". no it can't, ever.
[07:23:42] <ljharb> you can't hallucinate your way out of reality by pretending ESM is a) better, b) going to replace CJS, or c) that CJS is going away.
[07:23:59] <ljharb> good luck tho, i'm sure all the people who're stuck with CRA now will buy you a drink when you're stuck with vite in a few years
[07:25:15] <stagas> i try not to invest in vite's implementation details and treat it as a black box. most of the time i don't even use a vite.config, simply vite and build around that. so when it's time to ditch it, i can do it for another tool because i won't have adapted any of my own code to the tool

But 99.99% of the things i build never go there, so the really pragmatic solution is something that brings you to the point of having to discover that subtle bug, but having not wasted all of your time not actually building the app but doing "correct" configurations
[07:34:11] <stagas> that probably doesn't compile ^ :P

[17:51:23] <austincheney> Rockwood_, do what?  Add some JSX?
[17:51:48] <Rockwood_> austincheney, like?
[17:52:03] <Rockwood_> its react
[17:52:08] <Rockwood_> not native
[17:52:36] <austincheney> Right, its JSX.  Are you wanting to know how to do that without JSX?  Like vanilla JS?
[17:53:35] <Rockwood_> i never used vanilla js before
[17:53:43] <austincheney> its easy
[17:54:06] <Rockwood_> sure
[17:54:14] <Rockwood_> i wanna see that too
[17:54:32] *** Joins: NeoCron (~NeoCron@p200300c4cf4baa00766f97a7a0c56948.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[17:54:33] <austincheney> let me gather an example.  Keep in mind if you go down the vanilla road people are going to lose their shit on you.  There is a lot of insecurity in JavaScript most especially around how to acces the DOM.
[17:54:49] <austincheney> Yet, its what I prefer and what all frameworks eventually do under the hood anyways
[17:55:47] <austincheney> Rockwood_, several examples here: https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems/blob/master/lib/browser/content/file_browser.ts
[17:56:40] <austincheney> document.createElement creates a new element unattached to the document.  The setAttribute method allows attribute assignment on a node.
[17:57:06] <austincheney> The appendChild method adds an element to a location in the document.
[17:57:39] <Rockwood_> context very nice way
[17:57:44] <Rockwood_> i like this way too
[17:57:47] <austincheney> dont assign events as attributes, as React does
[17:58:09] <austincheney> React actually converts the onClick attributes to event listeners
[17:58:31] <Rockwood_> yeah i am agree
[18:00:01] <Rockwood_> very lengthy code
[18:00:33] <austincheney> There are two proper ways to add events.  1) use event listeners.  This is what everybody does because its resistant against assignment collisions, but there is a lot of added complexity with event listeners.  2) assign event handlers directly to an element's event property: myElement.click = myHandler.  This super simple (what I prefer), but third party code could replace your assignment and break your application
[18:01:34] *** Rockwood_ is now known as Rockwood
[18:01:36] <austincheney> Rockwood_, yes, most developers see that vanilla DOM interaction is highly declarative and then go into an emotional freefall like somebody bipolar who should be on meds.  Be prepared for that if you are writing code in a group.
[18:02:06] <austincheney> sorry, not declarative.  Imperative.
[18:02:48] <Rockwood> ah okay
[18:03:50] <austincheney> but its really about tradeoffs.  The imperative vanilla JS code is more code when creating content, but there is very little code to manage thereafter, while the declarative framework approach requires tremendous amounts of code to do any kind of modification to the page.
[18:05:02] <austincheney> these APIs to the DOM are executing no matter which approach you use.  Its only a matter if you have to look it or if its buried under layers of abstractions.

[19:24:29] <fweht> so its optionaal?
[19:24:40] <ljharb> fweht: yes, `await` is never required
[19:24:59] <ljharb> fweht: an `async function` always only returns a promise. `await` is sugar inside an `async function` for `.then` on a promise
[19:26:31] <ljharb> `await` should be used very rarely, unless it's in concert with `Promise.all`.
[19:26:39] <fweht> aaah wow i didnt know
[19:26:58] <fweht> i thought without await the functions will all be proceeded in parallel?
[19:28:24] <ljharb> fweht: JS is always single-threaded
[19:28:29] <fweht> hmm but my code stops working when i remove the await?
[19:28:32] <ljharb> fweht: nothing's in parallel, but things can happen concurrently
[19:28:42] <ljharb> fweht: because if you don't await a promise, you have to `.then` it.
[19:28:52] <ljharb> fweht: but share your code in a codesandbox, i'll show you how to improve it
[19:28:53] <fweht> aah yeah, ok, that makes sense
[19:29:15] <fweht> but in the last call of a function, that should be irrelevant?
[19:31:01] <ljharb> fweht: `return await` is redundant, yes, just return.

[19:35:54] <ljharb> ThePendulum: yes but that nuance would just be confusing here
[19:36:08] <ljharb> fweht: in that case you definitely have to await baz()
[19:36:19] <ljharb> fweht: otherwise `foo`'s promise can't wait for the baz promise to resolve
[19:36:56] <ljharb> fweht: but in that case, i assume baz doesn't depend on bar, so it's harmful to await them both like that. do `await Promise.all([bar(), baz()])`
[19:37:19] <ljharb> that way, bar and baz happen concurrently (not parallel), and you've correctly conveyed in your code that they don't depend on each other
[19:40:27] <fweht> ljharb: aah, thanks so much for the clarification!
[19:41:08] <fweht> its pretty logical :)

[21:16:17] <stagas> there is a subtle difference with `return promise` and `return await promise`
[21:16:59] <stagas> is that the stack trace will point to the function that does the return if you use return await, otherwise you lose it
[21:17:15] <stagas> not lose it but it goes one level up, the stack traces when it throws points to the other one that called it

[21:53:18] <de-facto> well whatever js uses for 123.456 then
[21:53:19] <ljharb> de-facto: and JS doesn't "reserve memory"
[21:53:20] <austincheney> de-facto, instead of talking about how to do something what is it you want to do?  As in end state?
[21:53:35] <ljharb> de-facto: JS is a memory-managed language, and it is *objectively incorrect* to be thinking about memory usage.
[21:53:51] <ljharb> austincheney: i mean technically JS only has double-precision floats
[21:53:59] <ljharb> i guess now there's also unlimited-precision integers
[21:54:12] <ljharb> but yes this definitely sounds like an xy problem

[21:54:17] <jellobot> defjam, The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X. See also: http://xyproblem.info/
[21:54:20] <ljharb> oops, de-facto
[21:54:22] <de-facto> i populate those 1k arrays of size 1k floats with loops and its slow to do that with the [] operator, hence how can i optimize for speed?
[21:54:28] <ljharb> de-facto: slow how?
[21:54:38] <ljharb> de-facto: but also yes, the SLOWEST thing you can do is preallocate an array
[21:54:46] <ljharb> de-facto: it is faster to do `[]` and `.push()` into it every time
[21:55:03] <ljharb> de-facto: basically every C/C++ optimization trick makes JS slower. don't try to be smarter than the engine.
[21:55:03] <de-facto> it is so slow that chrome blocks the site load for a moment
[21:55:09] <de-facto> i do it with [] and push()
[21:55:13] <ljharb> ok good
[21:55:16] <austincheney> de-facto, my beautifier that I used to maintain frequently dealt with JavaScript arrays in the 10s of millions of index performing a bunch of algorithms and it was very fast
[21:55:18] <ljharb> de-facto: ok so what are you trying to do with such an array at all?
[21:55:34] <de-facto> hold my data for the page
[21:55:38] <ljharb> what does the data represent
[21:55:48] <de-facto> metrics
[21:55:48] <ljharb> without 100% of the context we can't help effectively
[21:56:02] <ljharb> what's it measuring if you're computing it
[21:57:01] <austincheney> without seeing the code we are guessing, but my guess is that you are doing thing inefficient per index, but for the problems you are describing it would have to be an extreme mistake
[21:57:06] <austincheney> 1k indexes is tiny
[21:57:26] <de-facto> i have some measurement data that comes in as json and is in a global "data" object. its optimized for small transport size and now i need to process it to bring it into the full "expanded" state again, so its an object containing arrays that get populated on page load
[21:57:43] <de-facto> then after its done the page uses that expanded object to display metrics etc
[21:59:03] <austincheney> de-facto, my recommendation is to defer processing of data on page load.  Load all the UI artifacts and give the user an indication something is happening like a spinner.  Then process the data after.
[21:59:21] <de-facto> hence my question about what kind of memory management v8 will trigger in the background by such "expanding" or deep copying over into the expanded object properties
[22:00:29] <austincheney> de-facto, my current application displays an OS GUI in the browser including file system display.  The page load is about 30ms (excluding background graphic) including full state restoration.  I don't let file system contents hold up my page load.
[22:00:38] <de-facto> if i count up indices in a loop v8 wont know in advance how much memory to preserve for holding the final expanded state
[22:01:55] <austincheney> de-facto, dont worry about memory management unless you are writing for a tiny Raspberry-PI or something embedded.
[22:02:07] <austincheney> memory is dynamically allocated and it is extremely fast
[22:02:22] <austincheney> it is not always efficient (as far as quantity of memory) but it is always fast
[22:02:30] <de-facto> door rang bbl sorry
[22:03:01] <ljharb> de-facto: optimizing for small transport size is the wrong optimization
[22:03:11] <ljharb> de-facto: do all processing on the server
[22:03:23] <ljharb> de-facto: gzip will handle transport well enough
[22:03:41] <ljharb> de-facto: v8 does not TRY to know in advance how much memory to preserve. that's not how JS engines operate.
[22:03:48] <ljharb> de-facto: v8 doesn't *want* a hint - and it's faster without one.
[22:04:06] <austincheney> ljharb, I optimize for transport by sending large payloads as an array of arrays instead of an array of indexes.  It saves on key names, but it sounds like he is already doing that.
[22:04:23] <austincheney> errr, instead of an array objects

[22:48:35] <FlorianBad> When I create a canvas dynamically, assign it and its wrapper some styles with style.insertRule(), I cannot start drawing immediately because it seems to take some time to apply these styles. So if I call getBoundingClientRect() for example to get the size of the canvas it is 0, but if I put a setTimeout on that it works.
[22:48:51] <FlorianBad> So my question is: Is there anything better that I can use instead of setTimeout?
[22:49:34] <FlorianBad> Like some kind of callback that tells me the styles got applied... A timeout is completely arbitrary, it's a bit of an unreliable way to deal with the issue
