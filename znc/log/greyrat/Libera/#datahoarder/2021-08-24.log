[21:55:03] <ThePendulum> joepie91: actually managed to get through to PayPal via their message center. they confirmed there aren't any limits set on my account, but made a valid suggestion... I have another account that I haven't used in over a decade, I might be getting emails for that one
[21:55:39] <joepie91> ThePendulum: weird that you would suddenly get notifications for that, but yeah, sounds plausible
[21:55:54] <joepie91> speaking of which, AFAIK paypal does not allow multiple accounts for the same legal entity, but they are remarkably lax in enforcement
[21:56:29] <joepie91> I remember when I had to call them because it claimed my bank account number was already in use, and it turned out that it was attached to an old account I'd totally forgotten I had
[21:56:35] <ThePendulum> yeah the problem was I created that one before I was 18. I thought they'd disabled it at the time. I guess I get notifications now because of some law or policy change 
[21:56:51] <joepie91> and they were actually nice enough to give me hints on what the e-mail address was, enough for me to go "AH!"
[21:57:12] <joepie91> right yeah my accounts definitely date from before I was 18 :p
[21:57:45] <joepie91> I think I must've been 13-15 or so when I created the first one

[22:02:16] <Snuupy> you're also allowed a paypal account per legal entity (so one for your business, one personal, in each country)

[22:05:43] <joepie91> I dunno why there's such a huge difference between countries, but I did get the distinct impression that nobody from paypal HQ really cared much about local goings-on
[22:06:07] <joepie91> and that the Dutch service desk just got a bunch of logins to the internal systems and were told to figure out the support part themselves
