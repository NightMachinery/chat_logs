[02:47:18] <gilberth> When the phone rings it's custom here to pick up and greet with your name, so that the caller knows to whom he is speaking. The caller then would reply with his name. Within my family it would go like this: *phone rings* "Baumann!" "Yes, here too."
[02:51:03] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[02:52:47] <edgar-rft> yes, but I think it would be very strange if two people meet on the street only to check the connection quality
[02:55:23] <gilberth> On the street, I see the other person and could assume that air is there to carry the sound waves I make.
[02:56:29] <gilberth> But sometimes you use the optical channel and wave to get attention. Or even greet with just a nod.
[02:57:56] <edgar-rft> but in times where everybody only stares on their smartphone it might be useful to check whether the other person is listening at all
[02:59:10] <gilberth> Indeed, more so when head phones are involved. So both the optical channel and the audio channel is not working and you may resort to the tactile channel.
[03:00:51] <edgar-rft> best is when I walk on the street at night and suddenly somebody behind me is talking very loudly and it turns out that he's talking to somebody else via headphones
[03:01:44] <gilberth> Yes, pretty annoying.
[03:03:14] <edgar-rft> sometimes I go out on the street only to laugh about other people :-)
[03:04:29] <gilberth> So much for "social" media. I was riding public transport in the 90s a lot, it took me around 45min to get from my father's house into the city and would usually have a nice face to face chat for all the ride. Doesn't happen anymore, people stare at their phone and don't talk anymore. Very social.

[03:31:47] <edgar-rft> I still have a rather old Nokia phone, it's funny to ask people whether their shiny new app is also available for Nokia System 40 :-)

[08:02:04] <hayley> But I'm still not convinced that the mutation rate tends to be high enough that using the read barrier like this is faster than only updating on mutations.
[08:05:23] <hayley> TL/DR his argument is that even checking to see if the object is grey on update is too slow, and a marked-through bit instead only trips the barrier once.
[08:09:01] <hayley> I still don't like the idea of basically trapping all the time upon starting a mark cycle, as my machine takes 2µs to handle a segfault and the trap storm would just destroy things.

[13:50:11] <hayley> Yeah, both barriers would fire on all of memory.
