[02:51:00] <mdogg> I'm not sure how to interoperate that definition.  I still think you would need a preposition prior to using the word "whence".
[02:51:10] <LjL> no

[02:58:10] <LuisM14> though it's just more bought-y
[02:58:12] <mdogg> She is saying she "bought" something.  That is a typical English accent.  
[02:58:26] <mdogg> If that lady was saying "boat" it would sound differently.
[02:58:36] <LuisM14> yea
[02:58:44] <GuiToris> it beats me how you do that. Everything is pronounced differently on the other side of the pond but you still understand it

[12:17:40] <blkshp> Specify a year rather than "the 90s"
[12:18:53] <ln> the famous wall fell in the 80s, not 90s
[12:21:35] <aranam> ln: The Brandenburg Gate, a few meters from the Berlin Wall, was opened on 22 December 1989. The demolition of the Wall officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in 1994.[1] The "fall of the Berlin Wall" paved the way for German reunification, which formally took place on 3 October 1990.
[12:23:43] <ln> if people talk about e.g. "the day the Berlin wall fell", i don't think they are referring to the day of the actual planned demolition.
