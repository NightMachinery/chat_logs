[13:54:16] <victor> EdwardIII: I've used these previously with nice success: https://github.com/lambdaisland/trikl and https://github.com/eccentric-j/cljs-tui-template, second one more of a starting point than a library
[13:55:21] <EdwardIII> victor: i saw that cljs one, that's curious heh 
[13:55:45] <EdwardIII> trikl looks good
[13:55:46] <victor> haha, yeah, I like that API, very familiar to myself and others who've done Reagent stuff before
[13:55:49] <EdwardIII> thanks victor!
[13:56:06] <EdwardIII> yes in truth the api does look quite nice for cljs-tui-template. and their gif demos also look quite nice
[13:59:35] <victor> yeah, I think it uses https://github.com/chjj/blessed under the hood, which frankly, is a monster in itself, but using it for simpler projects is quite nice
[14:00:29] <EdwardIII> victor: how do you package it up? is there a way to bundle a node runtime with it?
[14:02:01] <victor> EdwardIII: shipped the compiled cljs as a JS package on a private NPM registry, users installed/used it with `npm install -g your-holy-tool`

[16:55:48] <EdwardIII> this is so weird. if i do (get-csrf-token) in the repl, it shows the csrf token string. when i try to use it here, it's nil: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/2efa56e44ca2ab05101cafb0ac6c6426#file-f-cljs-L6

[16:56:14] <EdwardIII> is the go macro somehow making this weird? i don't see how, because the println is outside of it, so that seems impossible
[17:10:19] <Para> Could be execution order shenanigans, `go` is more of a "take this form and put it elsewhere to be executed asynchronously at runtime's leisure" kind of thing.
[17:10:41] <EdwardIII> mmm
[17:10:50] <Para> > Returns a channel which will receive the result of the body when completed
[17:10:58] <Para> Use that to your advantage, mayhaps?
[17:11:02] <EdwardIII> it should still have access to any variables passed in right?
[17:11:18] <EdwardIII> confusingly as hell i've just been adding/removing printlns and, somehow, it's magically working 
[17:11:27] <Para> Heisenbug :)
[17:11:43] <EdwardIII> my favourite
[17:12:18] <EdwardIII> i was wondering if somehow the go block was executing before get-csrf-token had time to complete but that also seems impossible
[17:14:18] <sobel> i work with a guy who always says "time" when he means "sequence" and it trips him up pretty hard
[17:15:39] <sobel> i correct him at the risk of sounding pedantic, but like, we use a lot of promises, and i'm a fanatic about keeping async things crystal clear because code is already tricky enough without order-of-operation questions

[17:22:07] <EdwardIII> so, cljs-http lets you pass in a channel, and it will print the progress which is quite neat. however it literally just tells you the progress, not the name of the file heh. which is a pain if i'm trying to track multiple uploads. what's a smart way to work around this? https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/9e779682542e21758745577659d42e88

[22:52:18] <oreoking[m]> I am new to clojure
[22:52:30] <oreoking[m]> How can I clone a repository in clojure.
[22:56:35] <technomancy> (clojure.java.shell/sh "git clone https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/fennel") assuming you mean a git repository
[23:00:45] <sobel> w00t. easy-peasy doubled my batch performance with transducers and reducible-query
[23:05:12] <oreoking[m]> I install the clojure pkg on fedora 34 but it is saying clj is not a command but it recognizes the clojure command

[23:18:12] <ToxicFrog> oreoking[m]: it's possible that the fedora package is old (doesn't include a separate clj tool), or omits it for some other reason
[23:18:34] <oreoking[m]> ToxicFrog: then whats the pkg to install it
[23:19:16] <ToxicFrog> I don't know, I don't use fedora
[23:19:19] <ToxicFrog> That said, I think `clj` is just `clojure` with rlwrap already configured
[23:19:49] <ToxicFrog> So for non-REPL usage you can just use `clojure`, and for REPL usage you can `rlwrap clojure` or just `clojure` and accept that line editing is unavailable (although that's kind of unpleasant, so maybe use your editor's REPL instead?)
[23:21:13] <oreoking[m]> i want a lein alternative
[23:21:46] <ridcully> i want lein
[23:22:01] <ridcully> clj is a rlwrap-er around clojure
[23:22:14] <ridcully> so maybe you lack rlwrap?
[23:22:44] <ridcully> seems like nowadays installing your trusty $DEV tools from your distri is as bad as ever...

[23:25:15] <oreoking[m]> lein debug messages are killing me
[23:26:14] <ridcully> technomancy: no one cares... you got it into sdkman...
[23:26:52] <technomancy> ridcully: well, I use "we" here *very* loosely, haha
[23:27:06] <technomancy> ehashman did all the hard work for apt
[23:27:08] <ridcully> royal we?
[23:27:34] <ehashman> you rang?
[23:27:42] <technomancy> the opposite of royal we, whatever that is
[23:27:55] <technomancy> ehashman: just giving credit where it's due, haha
[23:28:02] <ehashman> appreciate it :)
[23:28:17] <ehashman> we have a GSoC student working on clj right now in Debian
[23:28:38] <ehashman> Debian also has always had an rlwrap clojure bash script, I believe upstream Clojure has now added them to the brew-install stuff
[23:28:44] <ridcully> no, i am very glad it's in sdkman and it seems maintained.  i happily was using it before with the selfupdate.
[23:29:34] <technomancy> ridcully: I guess the thing about packaging is you never know who uses what. I haven't heard of folks using sdkman but on the other hand that's exactly what you would hope for (not hearing anything) if it's working well.
[23:29:40] <ehashman> I imagine that Fedora has something similar to Debian
[23:30:03] <ehashman> this is what /usr/bin/clojure actually says on a Debian system https://salsa.debian.org/clojure-team/clojure/-/blob/main/debian/scripts/clojure
[23:32:31] <ridcully> that looks like 1.8 level clojure?
[23:32:40] <ridcully> or as "pre-spec-timeline"?
[23:33:20] <ridcully> you can not have just a clojure.jar right now (or ever).  there are at least three jars involved (the core and two spec ones)
[23:33:49] <ridcully> that was the reason why the clojure cli was introduced after all
[23:34:23] * jeaye is happy just using lein and focusing on the app being built instead of tooling.

[23:37:05] <technomancy> jeaye: you'll never get a conference talk accepted with that attitude =P
[23:37:29] <jeaye> I'll just find other things to gripe about, like spec instrumentation.
[23:38:17] <ridcully> having things work for ten year is totally un-vogue
[23:39:09] <ehashman> ridcully: yes this has existed since before 1.8
[23:39:24] <jeaye> I've never had a happier time with deps, plugins, and builds, in any language ecosystem, than I have with lein and clj (less so cljs, but shadow helps there).
[23:40:06] <jeaye> Cargo comes in second, but TOML is weird and the feature flags are sometimes confusing.
[23:41:32] <ridcully> but you can not make any money from the cow^wcustomers like that?!
[23:42:51] <jeaye> Make them suffer first so you can given them incremental benefits. For a price. Seems like it could work. :D
[23:44:24] <ridcully> it's also one of my favourite songe!
