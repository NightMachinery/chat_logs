[05:26:04] <dimadima> to render them lazily
[05:26:18] <dimadima> if you have 1,000 elements, you don't want to actually render them all into the dom

[17:37:13] <Xe> at some point my parents are going to be there
[17:37:17] <river> i think that people come up with conspiracy theories about covid because it's less scary than the reality
[17:37:20] <companion_cube> there's the evangelical subtype who thinks they're protected by Jesus, there's people who think they have a immune system, but it's always "wake up sheeple" style
[17:37:36] <river> it's less scary for people to think that this is all part of some evil plan that someone is in control of
[17:38:03] <Xe> i mean if you look at the evangelical mindset it's basically tailor made for it
[17:38:50] <companion_cube> river: maybe, but it's also less scary to take a vaccine :/
[17:39:00] <river> people are terrified of needles
[17:39:16] <river> I *thought* I was but when I actually got my injection i wasn't really bothered
[17:39:24] <companion_cube> it's really stupid, river, givne that the vaccine's needles are the smallest I've ever seen
[17:39:36] <companion_cube> and, well, if you land in the ICU it's another ballgame, needle wise

[17:39:41] <gwozniak> I will totally watch the needle go in when I get vaccine injections
[17:39:41] <companion_cube> 🙄
[17:39:45] <gwozniak> Same with taking blood
[17:39:47] <river> people will literally make shit up to (A) not get an injection and simultaneously (B) not admit that they're a scared of anything
[17:40:03] <ngoldbaum> also the day they decided they weren’t going to do anything extra to protect lesser people
[17:40:03] <companion_cube> gwozniak: taking blood is a much scarier needle
[17:40:19] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: also at first it was big coastal cities
[17:40:21] <Geekingfrog> Also, don't forget that there's a community effect. Once you've linked your identity somewhat to being antivax, and your social circles do the same, it's *really* hard to change.
[17:40:25] <companion_cube> yep
[17:40:30] <Xe> i actually have out of body experiences while getting a blood draw
[17:40:34] <Xe> it can be really annoying
[17:40:39] <Geekingfrog> I tend to faint on blood draw
[17:40:41] <Xe> really fucking annoying
[17:40:44] <dimadima> i don't think any of the above applies to my brother in law. he's definitely not into jesus or religion. and he's definitely not doing it because the alternative is more scary
[17:40:48] <Geekingfrog> no matter how small of quantity
[17:40:51] <dimadima> he's just a super nihilist
[17:40:55] <Xe> Geekingfrog: i don't just faint, i completely fall out of the body lol
[17:40:58] <dimadima> cause his life is shitty and he's a weak person
[17:41:00] <Geekingfrog> oÔ
[17:41:09] <Geekingfrog> what does your body do in the meantime ?
[17:41:10] <Xe> fucking astral projection style
[17:41:25] <Xe> well for one they usually get smelling salts out
[17:42:04] <dimadima> they do that at needle things?
[17:42:11] <dimadima> smelling salts is for real?
[17:42:17] <dimadima> i thought that was sole old timey thing
[17:42:28] <dimadima> was some*
[17:42:48] <Xe> i mean if you visibly start going unconscious yes they do attempt drastic measures to wake you lol
[17:43:03] <dimadima> and smelling salts is one of them?
[17:43:09] <Xe> yes
[17:43:11] <dimadima> i would have thought they'd just give you some time
[17:43:13] <dimadima> cool
[17:43:18] <dimadima> TIL!
[17:43:27] <epilys> imagine if they didn't though
[17:43:43] <dimadima> epilys: didn't give you smelling salts? you'd just wake up in a bit?
[17:43:46] <Xe> well yes after you're conscious again they do give you time, and if you don't become conscious very quickly they dial 911
[17:43:49] <epilys> try to wake you up
[17:43:50] <dimadima> it's not like you die if you pass out
[17:43:54] <epilys> you could be having something serious
[17:44:01] <epilys> actually passing out is bad for you
[17:44:03] <dimadima> well yeah they need to evaluate that
[17:44:06] <dimadima> epilys: oh yeah?
[17:44:13] <dimadima> i didn't know that
[17:46:33] <companion_cube> dimadima: does he have children?
[17:46:41] <dimadima> two
[17:46:44] <dimadima> one is past college
[17:46:48] <dimadima> one is late high school
[17:47:03] <companion_cube> ah well, at least it's not small children
[17:47:14] <companion_cube> don't forget to ask him if his life insurance and will are up to date
[17:47:14] <dimadima> why does that matter in this case
[17:47:20] <dimadima> ah
[17:47:21] <Xe> well at least losing him wouldn't be as hard in that phase of life
[17:47:33] <dimadima> 1% is both very high and very small
[17:47:59] <Xe> i'm still attempting to figure out how to phrase my email to my parents
[17:48:17] <dimadima> about what
[17:48:41] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: passing out after seeing blood or at blood draws is pretty common
[17:48:48] <Xe> disowning them
[17:48:51] <companion_cube> :D
[17:48:55] <companion_cube> good one
[17:49:22] <dimadima> maybe xe is serious
[17:49:40] <Xe> i am
[17:50:30] <gwozniak> I told my mother she needs therapy.  Since then she has no spoken to me.
[17:51:42] <gwozniak> I have a very neutral approach to my parents, since they had a very neutral approach to their kids
[17:52:58] <companion_cube> "you need therapy. we all need therapy, but you more than me."
[17:52:59] <gwozniak> Neither one of them was all that interested in being a parent. My mother has said multiple times (while trying to joke, but poorly) that she wanted each of me and my siblings the same amount: none at all.
[17:53:08] <companion_cube> fuck
[17:53:16] <companion_cube> saying it to the kids, that's harsh
[17:53:28] <gwozniak> she thinks she's being funny
[17:54:08] <companion_cube> if she wanted no kids, how comes she got several -_-
[17:54:13] <gwozniak> My dad beat us pretty bad when we were young, and my mom too. So much so that my mom's dad threatened to shoot him, so I'm told
[17:56:19] <gwozniak> He's calmed down a lot since then and knows he was not much of a father
[17:56:39] <companion_cube> :(
[17:57:20] <gwozniak> My mom is just... a narcissist who was a mistress for many years, with a man who openly did not like us
[17:57:49] <companion_cube> doesn't sound very, err, "neutral"
[17:58:33] <gwozniak> neutral in the sense of having any interest in her kids, but wanting all the "glory" of having kids who managed to have decent lives
[17:58:55] <Geekingfrog> damn, that's fucked up
[17:59:59] <gwozniak> yeah, it's pretty fucked up, but I don't let it get to me, even though I can ramble on about it for a long time
[18:00:45] <gwozniak> I recently visited my dad and asked him about some of the crazy shit he did.  He said that yeah, he probably shouldn't have done it
[18:01:04] <gwozniak> My mom admits nothing because she is always the victim
[18:01:12] <Geekingfrog> My mom worked in social services for most of her life, dealing with disfunctional or broken families. That somewhat vaccinated me against having children…
[18:01:14] <companion_cube> "probably"
[18:01:29] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: that's pessimistic; you'd be a good father
[18:01:33] <Geekingfrog> lol
[18:01:41] <gwozniak> The funny thing is, my dad is so much better these days
[18:01:56] <Geekingfrog> maybe because you all left the nest ?
[18:02:23] <gwozniak> I suspect that is a big part of it
[18:02:40] <gwozniak> And that we didn't really talk all that much for the past 30 years
[18:04:12] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: that kind of work can be so exhausting
[18:04:33] <gwozniak> kudos to your mom
[18:09:13] <gwozniak> I confronted my mom over her behaviour (which was ultimately a mistake), but when I pressed her on why she stayed with a man who did not like her children, she said that she wanted to get what was hers.  As in, she deserved the somewhat lavish lifestyle she got with him.
[18:09:40] <gwozniak> And, of course, she does not admit to saying that now
[18:09:59] <gwozniak> I think she thinks I care about being in her will
[18:11:08] <demiurge> why are everyone's parents so horrible
[18:11:24] <companion_cube> because we hear mostly of the bad ones, I think
[18:11:25] <gwozniak> In short, I have bad parents and having mostly ignored them for my entire adult life, so you can too! ;)
[18:11:34] <demiurge> companion_cube: yeah i guess so
[18:11:40] <Geekingfrog> yeah, you don't hear of train arriving on time
[18:11:49] <companion_cube> well, in france you do
[18:11:50] <companion_cube> oops()
[18:11:54] <demiurge> nice
[18:11:54] <gwozniak> I will counter all the bad by saying of all my friends, nearly all of them seem to be great parents
[18:12:14] <gthm> having kids is difficult. you can do your best 99% of the time, but in aggregate that still leaves a lot of room for you to mess up, and your kids remember those times
[18:12:31] <gthm> (assuming you're trying at all)
[18:12:36] <demiurge> yes, but they're going to remember those in context
[18:12:59] * gthm shrugs
[18:13:15] <gthm> maybe. I remember some things my dad did when I was very young and I have no context for
[18:13:46] <gthm> I'm sure I've already given my kids some memories they're not going to like
[18:14:35] <demiurge> i mean, my parents screwed up a bunch, and generally i think weren't equipped emotionally for having kids
[18:14:40] <gwozniak> gthm: I give my mom credit for providing for me and my siblings when we were young.  She did care more than my dad.
[18:14:53] <demiurge> but they weren't consistently terrible in the way gwozniak is describing
[18:15:23] <gthm> no of course
[18:15:45] <gthm> and it sounds like his parents were... on a different level
[18:16:19] <gwozniak> I got little to no emotional guidance as a kid.  As a family, there were no discussions about things.  You learned by failing and being embarassed by others for failing
[18:16:50] <gwozniak> Which really inhibits you from trying in the first place

[18:33:15] <gerikson> who knows how long they're gonna be around
[18:36:17] <gwozniak> Mine were pretty young when they had me, so I expect they may be around for a bit longer
[18:36:48] <gwozniak> I am trying to have some kind of relationship with them, tho. I admit to feeling some guilt to shutting them out
[18:37:29] <gerikson> my wife was 22 when she had her daughter... still bearing that cross
[18:37:49] <gerikson> partly she swore never to abandon her kids emotionally because her mom did so
[18:38:06] <gwozniak> +1
[18:38:35] <gwozniak> It's not like my mom's situation was great, either.  Let's just say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
[18:38:51] <epilys> you shouldn't feel guilty for cutting toxicity out of your life.
[18:38:58] <epilys> you deserve peace
[18:39:02] <gerikson> it takes some maturity to be able to see that kind of thing so to say dispassionately
[18:39:05] <gwozniak> by all accounts, gerikson, you sound like great parents
[18:39:24] <gwozniak> of course, I'm only getting one side of it... ;)

[19:33:18] <buttsbot> This kid loves Komodo dragons : Unexpected
[19:37:57] <glider> gerikson, it is easy to worry about your parenting. Ever read a parenting book? Lots of they say, if your kid is messed up, you need to figure out what you did wrong.
[19:38:25] <companion_cube> yikes
[19:38:33] <companion_cube> of course it's easy to worry about parenting
[19:38:40] <companion_cube> but shaming parents? what kind of book does that?
[19:38:56] <manicennui> Watch the komodo dragon kid and tell me whether his parents are doing a good job.
[19:39:05] <glider> Well no, but it does say you often need to ask yourself that.
[19:39:11] <glider> I would not say it was shaming.
[19:39:14] <manicennui> companion_cube: Parents should be ashamed. They had dirty, dirty sex.
[19:39:18] <companion_cube> :D
[19:39:27] <glider> manicennui, We didn't for our first.
[19:39:29] <companion_cube> you call that dirty, I call that good
[19:39:31] <companion_cube> oops
[19:39:46] <glider> To be fair, you can have it good and dirty.
[19:40:44] <dimadima> companion_cube: could also just mint an NFT
[19:40:47] <manicennui> I think there is only so much parenting can do.
[19:40:59] <companion_cube> "I wanted children but then I bought NFTs instead"
[19:41:00] <manicennui> My brother is a complete sociopath fuck up.
[19:41:12] <companion_cube> non fungible toddlers
[19:41:18] <dimadima> heh
[19:41:21] <glider> companion_cube, lol!
[19:41:32] <manicennui> Believes conspiracy theories, manipulates everyone, has 7 children, is broke...
[19:41:40] <companion_cube> oooof
[19:41:49] <companion_cube> why have 7 children
[19:41:52] <companion_cube> who does that
[19:41:57] <glider> My sister was qanon, but only has 1.
[19:42:31] <manicennui> companion_cube: He didn't do it intentionally, he just won't use protection.
[19:42:36] <manicennui> Neither will his dumb wife.
[19:43:04] <dimadima> i'd lump that into intentional
[19:43:09] <dimadima> with regards to having chilren
[19:43:23] <companion_cube> that's even crazier
[19:43:31] <Geekingfrog> or delusional? People believe weird shit
[19:43:33] <prussian> < manicennui> companion_cube: Parents should be ashamed. They had dirty, dirty sex. <--- breeders, smh.
[19:43:49] <companion_cube> I mean, after the first child, maybe you realize that birth and child rearing are no jokes
[19:44:10] <prussian> 7 kids though. damn.
[19:44:14] <prussian> real american hero.
[19:44:17] <dimadima> a lot of people don't make too much of a deal out of it
[19:44:23] <dimadima> either way
[19:45:01] <companion_cube> like the wife doesn't mind "accidentally" being pregnant and giving birth?
[19:45:17] <dimadima> yeah that's the craziest part
[19:45:22] <dimadima> but some women don't mind i guess
[19:45:43] <dimadima> my wifes grandmother had 9 kids
[19:45:52] <dimadima> she said after the first few it was like "spitting on the pavement"
[19:45:55] <dimadima> exact words
[19:46:19] <dimadima> #greatestgeneration
[19:47:11] <dimadima> "#greatestgeneration" to indicate sarcasm or whatever
[19:47:57] <manicennui> companion_cube: That's the thing. He is a sociopath and I realized that he was that way when we were children too.
[19:48:03] <manicennui> He doesn't actually care about them.
[19:48:16] <companion_cube> dimadima: charming
[19:48:35] <manicennui> He shows them affection sometimes, but doesn't realize that not being able to care for children and continuing to have more and more of them shows that you don't actually give a shit.
[19:48:44] <manicennui> He also fights with his wife to the point that the cops have to be called.
[19:48:49] <manicennui> And is a pothead.
[19:49:01] <manicennui> We had the same parents and turned out complete differently.
[19:49:42] <dimadima> i would joke but you've already indicated that it's not funny
[19:49:49] <dimadima> already in the past, i mean
[19:50:43] <manicennui> Hmm?
[19:50:56] <manicennui> You won't offend me, if that was directed at me.
[19:51:52] <companion_cube> prussian: you got a problem with people with children? :p
[19:55:15] <dimadima> yeah that was to you manicennui

[19:56:44] <prussian> companion_cube: negatory
[19:57:02] <prussian> merely a joke I remember long ago in one of those crazy RMS mailing list hell threads.
[19:57:13] <prussian> about people announcing births.
[19:57:22] <dimadima> frustrating that CSS doesn't have a way to truncate text with ellipsis such that the ellipsis is in the middle
[19:57:35] <dimadima> ellipsis "is" or ellipsis "are"?
[19:57:51] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: wait, in _any_ hashtable?
[19:58:10] <prussian> w-wut
[19:58:13] <ngoldbaum> i don't feel like learning enough java to check, but according to this guy yeah
[19:58:33] <epilys> ellipsis is ellipses are
[19:58:39] <companion_cube> prussian: would RMS write that? :/
[19:59:28] <dimadima> https://java.net/ has a broken cert?

[20:00:16] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: manicennui could try it in clojure
[20:00:19] <companion_cube> ohhhh shit
[20:00:22] <companion_cube> why
[20:00:28] <companion_cube> why would a hashcode depend on … IO
[20:00:33] <ngoldbaum> enterprise webscale URL hashing
[20:00:35] <prussian> w-wut
[20:00:40] <companion_cube> that's insaen
[20:00:49] <companion_cube> hash functions should be deterministic and fast
[20:01:01] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't think Clojure maps use Java's maps, but I could be wrong.
[20:01:09] <manicennui> Since Clojure has persistent data structures.
[20:01:16] <manicennui> I suppose it could use them in its implementation somehow.
[20:01:23] <companion_cube> I mean yo ucan create a HashMap from clojure
[20:01:27] <companion_cube> not idiomatic but it's there
[20:01:36] <manicennui> Ah, sure.
[20:01:53] <prussian> delet this code. holy fuck
[20:02:39] <dimadima> i've seen other similar shit in java
[20:02:42] <dimadima> trying to remember
[20:02:56] <dimadima> some IP function that called DNS
[20:03:04] <prussian> I will rewrite it all in rust now.
[20:03:08] <prussian> it has been decided.
[20:03:19] <ngoldbaum> how nice of you to do work for larry ellison
[20:03:26] <ngoldbaum> that's how he affords the yachts
[20:04:19] <manicennui> Decades of everyone wanting everything possible added to the language and its libraries.
[20:04:24] <manicennui> With no good BDFL.
[20:04:49] <prussian> the language for the everyman.
[20:04:54] <dimadima> i think there's a bit of internet optimism thrown itno the above example as well
[20:05:07] <dimadima> i don't think that's from JDK 17, i think that's from a like JDK 1.1
[20:05:18] <prussian> I'm starting to wonder how many unused and undiscovered CVEs now lurk
[20:05:23] <prussian> I never realized how bad it was.
[20:05:42] <manicennui> Kind of surprising that they haven't been discovered based on how many people use this stuff.
[20:05:45] <dimadima> and yeah it's not in IP code it's in URL code. URL code is all just topic
[20:05:50] <dimadima> toxic*
[20:06:22] <dimadima> URL resolves DNS for many other reasons too
[20:06:24] <companion_cube> you can wish to have URLs in the stdlib, without wishing them to be insane
[20:06:35] <dimadima> yeah
[20:06:44] <companion_cube> who knows if the CVEs are unused?
[20:08:00] <epilys> would all those surveillance corps and three letter agencies exist if there werent?
[20:08:19] <epilys> they can't only work with physical access attacks
[20:10:41] <prussian> Well.... true I guess
[20:10:44] <prussian> Good point
[20:11:53] <prussian> I wonder how many people are going into work totally oblivious to the log4j stuff
[20:11:58] <prussian> Today
[20:12:24] <ngoldbaum> they're working at companies that have plenty of other unpatched vulns
[20:13:38] <dimadima> the log4j thing is pretty awesome
[20:13:42] <dimadima> i'm glad i'm not running java
[20:13:51] <dimadima> today
[20:13:59] <dimadima> that would be annoying
[20:14:27] <dimadima> i mean, if you're not running something open source then you don't need to panic, really, right?
[20:14:33] <indigo> Enjoy your free credit monitoring
[20:14:43] <dimadima> heh

[20:15:44] <dimadima> epilys: but someone needs to know how to send a payload that will get logged
[20:16:10] <dimadima> so let's say i have public facing services running log4j, just that alone doesn't mean toooo much
[20:16:31] <epilys> I meant, everyone pretty much uses foss somewhere in their tech stack
[20:17:03] <dimadima> yeah for sure, everywhere in their stacks
[20:17:08] <dimadima> 99% of my code isn't my code
[20:17:23] <dimadima> if not 99.999999999 if you count linux etc :)
[20:18:06] <demiurge> it's not going to be very difficult to get things logged in most cases, and you get immediate feedback if it worked
[20:19:00] <epilys> dimadima, I use my own mail client but that's it, rest is foss :D
[20:21:09] <dimadima> what's your mail client?
[20:21:21] <dimadima> is it open source?
[20:21:30] <dimadima> i mean, have you published it?
[20:21:36] <dimadima> that's pretty cool to have your own mail client :)
[20:22:57] <epilys> https://meli.delivery/   https://crates.io/crates/meli   https://github.com/meli/meli/
[20:22:58] <buttsbot> GitHub - meli/meli: 🐝 experimental terminal mail client, mirror of https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli.git https://crates.io/crates/meli
[20:23:53] <epilys> I don't use proprietary software at all, except for my android phone and of course the various firmwares in hardware
[20:26:04] <dimadima> do you use calyx or something like that
[20:26:04] <river> I think that the government could use taxes to give money to FOSS projects
[20:26:18] <river> like how they [sometimes] fill potholes in roads
[20:27:13] <indigo> I also don’t use proprietary software at all, except for my Windows PC and Apple products
[20:27:38] <epilys> indigo, :p
[20:27:45] <dimadima> lol
[20:29:23] <dimadima> i use proprietary software, but i pirate all of it
[20:29:44] <gwozniak> I happily pay for some software if I find it to be useful and good
[20:29:56] <dimadima> (that was a joke)
[20:30:02] <Brekkjern> I give zero fucks if software is proprietary or not as long as it does the job in a decent way.
[20:30:06] <gwozniak> Not much qualifies in that regard, mind you
[20:31:56] <river> I prefer free software
[20:32:12] <epilys> You can pay for free software if the project/devs take donations
[20:32:17] <river> im not sure why..
[20:33:28] <gwozniak> Yes, but the not free stuff I pay for is already better than the free stuff
[20:39:13] <epilys> like? (genuine curiosity)
[20:42:57] <Brekkjern> All the games...
[20:44:24] <ngoldbaum> dude tux cart it’s all the rage
[20:45:41] <epilys> oh yeah that's a different story altogether
[20:47:22] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[20:59:09] <manicennui> The free audio/visual tools are still mostly garbage.
[20:59:46] <manicennui> With a few exceptions in very specific areas.
[21:00:08] <manicennui> Audio in general on Linux is hot garbage.
[21:00:51] <manicennui> Which also included Android in the past. Not sure whether they fixed it.
[21:15:30] <indigo> I hear Blender is a nice exception
[21:15:59] <bkero> pipewire and jack p gud
[21:16:32] <bkero> What part is hot garbage?
[21:17:04] <river> i had a go with pulseaudio simple the other day, but i think i need to move to the async api
[21:17:08] <drakonis> it has improved quite a lot recently
[21:18:48] <manicennui> indigo: Yeah, blender is one of the exceptions I was thinking of.
[21:19:22] <manicennui> bkero: Besides all of the problems people have with pulseaudio, the audio stack has high latency and is highly affected by load on the machine.
[21:20:53] <demiurge> blender and darktable are both best in their respective areas imo. the audio situation seems worse
[21:21:21] <demiurge> pulseaudio is not really linux audio at its best though
[21:22:38] <pja> It’s OK, there’s an all new Linux audio layer coming.
[21:22:41] <pja> Again.
[21:22:46] <companion_cube> pipewire?
[21:23:15] <drakonis> pipewire already works fine though
[21:23:56] <pja> (It does look like pipewire might be an improvement though.)
[21:28:30] <Xe> https://lobste.rs/s/empj2u/what_are_you_doing_this_week#c_5jbqzn <-- thoughts on me using JS to render part of my website that is currently very annoying to write client side
[21:28:31] <buttsbot> What are you doing this week? | Lobsters
[21:29:32] <river> could you expand the custom tag out using XSLT (or something else)?
[21:33:10] <epilys> write a custom markdown tag?
[21:33:12] <river> "Julian Assange suffers stroke in Belmarsh prison, fiancée says"
[21:35:51] <gwozniak> jack audio is some kind of cruel joke to setup
[21:37:09] <companion_cube> jack… the thing before ALSA, which was before pulseaudio, which was before pipewire?
[21:37:14] <companion_cube> welcome to 2002? :D
[21:39:33] <gwozniak> I concur with manicennui that audio on Linux is still hot garbage
[21:42:15] <manicennui> I just thought of a new work style that I'd like to make popular.
[21:42:22] <manicennui> Completely async development.
[21:42:35] <manicennui> Once per month, the PMs visit me in my cottage in the woods and give me work.
[21:42:43] <manicennui> And I give them the previous work they requested.
[21:42:54] <ngoldbaum> hermit-driven development
[21:43:13] <manicennui> No meetings or anything in between visits.
[21:43:54] <gwozniak> Stuff I pay for and use, because I find it to be good: Kaleidoscope (on macOS), Reaper, PDF XChange Editor, Xming, Directory Opus, and I may spring for Affinity Photo
[21:44:06] <pja> Jack is still the only way to get reliable low latency audio on Linux IIRC.
[21:44:21] <pja> Pipewire is promising to get there though?
[21:44:41] <gwozniak> It may very well be
[21:44:50] <Xe> epilys: i'd rather not have my own dialect of markdown if it makes sense, something where I go in and can then more easily replace it later (IE when porting my posts into LaTeX form for typesetting) would be much preferable
[21:44:53] <manicennui> Even once you get there, the pro tools are all Windows/Mac.
[21:45:11] <manicennui> Not that that matters for most of us.
[21:45:28] <river> but you are adding a custom tag
[21:45:58] <gwozniak> manicennui: Reaper works on Linux, but is clearly a Windows app that's been ported
[21:46:21] <gwozniak> I expect Pro Tools is still king here
[21:48:13] <manicennui> gwozniak: I can only imagine the fun once you add more audio equipment that has to be supported by the OS.
[21:48:38] <Xe> river: a custom tag is easy to look through and replace when I get to the typesetting phase, i could even program pandoc to recognize it and then insert the right LaTeX invocation
[21:49:36] <Xe> my goal really is to make thigns a bit less complicated for writing lol

[21:56:47] <buttsbot> Roblox Pressured Us to Delete Our Video. So We Dug Deeper. - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY
[21:57:01] <imode> the future is depressing.
[21:57:48] <epilys> im living in a blissful ignorance of what roblox is
[21:57:59] <gwozniak> I have never heard of it
[21:58:02] <manicennui> You probably don't have kids.
[21:58:10] <gwozniak> Yes, I do not have kids
[21:58:17] <manicennui> It actually sounds pretty bad ass.
[21:58:18] <imode> I used to play it as a kid.
[21:58:24] <imode> it was badass.
[21:58:28] <imode> now it's uh.
[21:58:30] <imode> horrifying.
[21:58:37] <epilys> is it old or are you young? :p
[21:58:38] <pja> People Make Games are good people.
[21:58:39] <manicennui> imode: What is the problem with it?
[21:58:45] <imode> that video summarizes it.
[21:58:53] <manicennui> Can't really watch it right now.
[21:58:54] <imode> tl;dr it's child exploitation at scale.
[21:59:05] <manicennui> Microtransactions or something?
[21:59:11] <imode> ehhhh it's worse than that.
[21:59:15] <Geekingfrog> I remember the original video, that was very depressing
[21:59:19] <pja> One of the PMG used to work for Eurogamer IIRC.
[21:59:41] <imode> give the video a watch when you have the time, my summary won't do it justice.
[22:01:15] <pja> & Quinns is ex-RockPaperShotgun of course.
[22:01:33] <pja> They are good people basically. I’d trust their reporting on this.
[22:02:44] <imode> it's basically a little virtual job & stock market that kids are sucked into and eventually exploited for their creative work to keep the program running and flooded with different games.
[22:02:59] <imode> with power dynamics that are obviously one-sided.
[22:03:13] <epilys> preparing them for the real world I see
[22:03:16] <imode> pretty much.
[22:04:08] <imode> it rides a line, drifting too far on a particular side.
[22:06:47] <imode> there's a part of this that I disagree with (i.e that roblox should monitor/moderate Discord), but it's always countered with the "why didn't they do this right in the first place".
[22:08:00] <imode> like, you had a forum. you had a place where people could socialize. but because you're a pile of inept monkeys, you pushed kids onto platforms where people don't care.
[22:08:00] <prussian> does the vaccine booster have a "change in sense of smell" side-effect?
[22:08:08] <prussian> because stuff is smelling funny
[22:08:16] <imode> prussian: uhhh.. not that I'm aware.
[22:08:28] <companion_cube> it shouldn't
[22:08:28] <Brekkjern> Just finished watching Arcane for the 3rd time. Still just as good :)
[22:08:34] <indigo> Ah, another itamarst article that can be boiled down into one sentence... "upgrade your dependencies before they go EoL"
[22:08:38] <prussian> uh oh
[22:08:51] <imode> get yourself tested dude
[22:09:20] <cb> indigo: my fav is when he shits on alpine because python's own problems intersecting with docker's own problems
[22:09:34] <cb> when i hear the word docker, i remove the safety from my browning
[22:10:17] <indigo> LOL
[22:10:59] <indigo> I wonder when we're all going to wake up and realize that this is just shameless content marketing
[22:11:10] <imode> what is.
[22:11:39] <indigo> Itamarst's posts
[22:11:45] <imode> ooo, got a link.

[22:12:18] <imode> yeah that's content marketing.
[22:12:50] <companion_cube> getting tested can be such a clusterfuck
[22:13:01] <imode> posting 'water is wet' and advertising your new paid class on how to treat water is just marketing for the class.
[22:13:20] <imode> companion_cube: they have home tests you can grab.
[22:13:29] <imode> really easily.
[22:13:33] <companion_cube> not the CVS I go to :/
[22:13:37] <imode> oh.
[22:13:41] <imode> lame. hit up a wallgreens.

[22:33:05] <manicennui> Bored Ape NFT accidentally sells for $3,000 instead of $300,000
[22:33:05] <Brekkjern> PRs are welcome :D
[22:33:22] <manicennui> What does it mean if it doesn't share the title but also doesn't crash?
[22:33:36] <manicennui> Errored but captured the error?
[22:33:55] <Brekkjern> That, or the document doesn't contain a title tag
[22:33:58] <manicennui> "The NFT was instantly snapped up by an automated account - and put back on sale at nearly $250,000."
[22:34:00] <Brekkjern> Or it is inserted by JS later
[22:34:36] <manicennui> The only explanation that I've heard that makes any amount of sense for this nonsense is money laundering.
[22:34:50] <Brekkjern> That, and stupidity
[22:35:08] <manicennui> Most stupid people don't have that much money.
[22:36:25] <manicennui> I don't doubt that there are some random people who have gotten lucky on meme stocks and bitcoin, but they can't be most of this market.
[22:36:25] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[22:37:02] <Brekkjern> Well, I made money on bitcoin by pretty much not doing anything at all, so...
[22:37:13] <epilys> It's just people who are into the scam building up hype to attract spenders
[22:37:20] <manicennui> Enough to waste a few hundred thousand on NFTs?
[22:37:37] <epilys> the scam worked, BBC wrote about it so it's free advertising
[22:38:06] <epilys> the point they wanted made was "NFTs **could** sell for 300_000"
[22:38:31] <manicennui> The entire "mistake" could be part of the scam.
[22:38:39] <epilys> that's what I'm saying manicennui
[22:38:43] <manicennui> Ah.
[22:40:01] <indigo> It looks like people are actually buying these things https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub?tab=activity
[22:40:37] <indigo> Lol, Steve Aoki bought one
[22:42:20] <manicennui> It might not appear so scammy if the art was really great.
[22:42:59] <epilys> The hashes are more aesthetic
[22:44:04] <epilys> I'm rendering a simple spring simulation with just a ryzen, no gpu. https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vqkcQFkSCbeQAzjHHLjtSZuC/image.png
[22:44:35] <epilys> It takes forever to render 250 frames (less than 10 seconds at 24fps)
[22:45:00] <epilys> eeh, a bit more than 10 sec*
[22:45:35] <epilys> if this cryptocurrency fad is over, I can finally buy a GPU at a reasonable price?
[22:47:21] <indigo> I've been on EVGA's waitlist since April for a 3060ti
[22:47:37] <epilys> for how much?
[22:48:05] <epilys> "can you imagine a world without cryptocurrency?" https://chaos.social/system/media_attachments/files/106/453/082/555/483/947/original/ce595497a073f406.jpg
[22:48:23] <companion_cube> it would be a pretty similar world, except a bit better
[22:48:34] <indigo> epilys: $480
[22:48:43] <epilys> companion_cube, a bitcoin better
[22:49:08] <epilys> indigo, okay that's not unreasonable but then again I don't know what a 3060ti is in term of performance
[22:49:19] <manicennui> Plenty of other terrible things about this timeline.
[22:50:33] <demiurge> ideally cryptocurrency needs to succeed to the point that all the capitalists invest most of their wealth in it, and then magically disappear
[22:51:05] <indigo> IIUC it has the best price/performance ratio of this generation, which is what I usually look for
[22:51:11] <companion_cube> you need a stream of cryptocurrencies demiurge
[22:51:16] <epilys> daily reminder that the earliest letter recorded in history is a complaint about something not being good enough
