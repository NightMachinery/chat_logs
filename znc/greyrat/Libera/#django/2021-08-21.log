[00:26:26] <djacobs> Gents, I know this has been ask thousands of times, but is there a common practice regarding what files to add in a django git-repo?
[00:26:33] <djacobs> Do we add the venv files to?
[00:26:39] <jfoster> djacobs i wouldn't.
[00:27:08] <jfoster> the django project lists python dependencies in requirements.txt
[00:27:27] <jfoster> you don't need to include the actual pulled in requirements, just the ingredients list.
[00:28:25] <jfoster> I know there are newer virtual env methods, but I still use virtualenvwrapper https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[00:28:32] <djacobs> so on top-level just the Requirements.txt and the <Project_name>-directory!
[00:28:47] <jfoster> the venvs are stored in my ~/.virtualenvs/[project / env name]/...
[00:28:55] *** Quits: slav0nic (slav0nic@python.su) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:29:10] <jfoster> Ya, there are still things that can be ignored. I think pay attention to the .gitignore file contents
[00:30:15] <djacobs> thats my next question, should i add the <project_name>/<project_name> folder as well (this is the directory that contains the settings.py, but what about the __init__.py files?
[00:30:43] <jfoster> Ya absolutely.
[00:31:05] <djacobs> Ok cause i had my doubts about the __pycache__ file! :D
[00:31:24] <jfoster> ya i don't include that
[00:31:25] <djacobs> And i doubt that we add the sqlite file ? :D
[00:31:27] <jfoster> I suggest thinking less about what you're including and instead what you're not. Here's a sample https://dpaste.org/7ZRv
[00:31:57] <djacobs> jfoster Thanks man!
[00:31:58] <jfoster> right think in terms of if you were workign on this with another person and they were doing their own local development, would this file help them or would it get out of sync
[00:32:43] <djacobs> well the sqlite file could help, but since it also contains user-data (including passwords), it might not be the safest thing! :D
[00:32:45] <jfoster> you're welcome. It takes practice, don't worry about getting it perfect. I def recommend using an IDE that uses color coding of your project tree so you can see what is ignored at a glance
[00:32:58] <djacobs> Ieuw, IDE's :d
[00:33:02] <jfoster> I am a big advocate for pycharm, it is very good at code management.
[00:33:07] <jfoster> leu?
[00:33:19] <djacobs> Its like saying Yugh! :d
[00:33:37] <jfoster> ah, well, idk pycharm is extremely powerful.
[00:34:09] <djacobs> I'll defenitly check it out sometime, but i'm afraid im rusted in my old ways of vi-ing! :D
[00:34:14] <jfoster> i didn't like it at first either, it is pretty expanisive in its capability. I didn't even use the debugger i think for the first 8 months.
[00:34:36] <jfoster> I can't imagine working with a big project now without it.  The interactive commits are really something.
[00:34:58] <jfoster> its super cheap too for pro.
[00:36:45] <jfoster> i think, in part due to the way it presents code and projects in general it is easier to wrap your head around concepts like what should and should not be committed.  The syntax highlighting and hints lint really well. Coding in pycharm has made me a much stronger developer.
[00:37:13] <jfoster> some people like vscode, but at least for python / web dev in django, i think pycharm is the bees knees.
[00:37:20] <djacobs> aaah its another jetbrains solution :D

[00:46:11] <jfoster> I don't typically use sqlite, but i put the .gitignore at the base of the project so like, ~/documents/code/[project_name]/.gitignore
[00:46:44] <jfoster> you can provide a path if you store it elsewhere.  It can be tricky if a file has been added and then you add an ignore afterward. I've been tripped up on that.
[00:47:21] <jfoster> If something isn't ignoring that seems like it should, sanity check it with another test file using the same path.  I can't remember the work around but something like deleting and adding again
[00:48:46] <jfoster> djacobs ya, jetbrains is cool IMO. I have interfaced with their support a lot, provided a lot of bug reports and feature requests. they are in general responsive. They do ignore some thing I wish they did not, like the .env plugin should be pulled into pycharm but largely I have only good things to say about JB and their IDE ecosystem

[03:56:08] <niv> None directly.
[03:56:25] <niv> My question if it's best to delete all persons and recreate them on backend import with new schema

[03:57:22] <djacobs> aaah so its upon running that you get the unique constraint violation?
[03:57:28] <niv> exactly
[03:57:42] <djacobs> well you can always use dbshell to query the non-unique objects and delete them like this
[03:58:11] <niv> My other idea was to introduce the new unique ID with `blank=True, null=True`, create (duplicate) users with new constrains and then delete the ones that have null in new unique constraints
[03:58:27] <niv> but I feel it's kinda the same as to delete every Person and recreate it with new schema
[03:59:23] <djacobs> or you could create a temp table in the DB where you insert all the unique records
[03:59:30] <djacobs> and afterwards rename the table
[03:59:47] <djacobs> it also depends on the dataload you have in the db!
[04:00:29] <niv> djacobs right, I currently add the new fields, then do a `migrations.AlterUniqueTogether` and afterwards a `migrations.RunPython` call to delete objects without new unique identifier
[04:00:48] <niv> after that, the schema is correct and the objects will be recreated on next import
[04:00:59] <niv> I basically just wanted someone to confirm that's not a bad approach

[09:37:16] <Guest67> hey all i made some good progress on this twilio thing
[09:37:24] <Guest67> but i have 1 thing i need to do now
[09:37:30] <Guest67> https://dpaste.org/bk1h
[09:38:04] <Guest67> line 54
[09:38:27] <Guest67> i want to somehow get the number inputted from the form into this
[09:39:52] <Guest67> flask uses https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/voice-javascript-sdk-quickstart-python/blob/main/app.py#L63
[09:41:00] <Guest67> the voice function generates the twiml on lines 21 - 23
[09:41:08] <Guest67> the twiml is the key to the phone call
[09:41:35] <Guest67> if i replace the twiml to phone number with any that i type in, i am golden
[09:42:15] <Guest67> strangely enough if i do django form.is_valid stuff in the phone() function.. the javascript ignores any server code
[09:43:09] <Guest67> the javascript does not submit the call button like it normally would
[09:44:38] *** Quits: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood) (Quit: Life beckons)
[09:49:17] <GinFuyou> Guest67, but you don't want to validate form in phone() or do you?
[09:49:40] <GinFuyou> if you want data from it in voice()
[09:51:57] <Guest67> i don't think it is necessary to do anything in phone() since the flask link does not show that
[09:52:29] <Guest67> i figure if i validate in phone() then the javascript won't work for browser based calls
[09:53:55] <Guest67> if i validate phone() i can get the context of phone_number from forms.py out of it though

[09:57:58] <Guest67> just to be the template or replace index.html in the flask example
[09:58:25] <Guest67> and where i could make a forms.py element and do what that dpaste is doing

[10:00:50] <GinFuyou> mmm, wait you validate phone and then send it back to the client? Why?
[10:01:01] *** Joins: anorthall (~anorthall@user/anorthall)
[10:02:08] <Guest67> i thought that most recent dpaste was a way i could extract the number i type into the input and get it from context and use it somewhere like voice()
[10:02:36] <GinFuyou> if you need data in voice() submit form to voice()
[10:03:02] <GinFuyou> extracting data and resubmitting it defeats all the purpose
[10:03:10] <Guest67> good point
[10:03:25] <Guest67> but voice() generates the xml
[10:03:38] <Guest67> it lives at /phone/voice/ url
[10:03:43] <GinFuyou> ...and ?
[10:03:58] <Guest67> idk it is a static page and you can't do much with it
[10:04:27] <GinFuyou> voice() can't be static page, because it's dynamic function
[10:04:34] <GinFuyou> So I don't follow
[10:04:42] <Guest67> it returns an XML document though
[10:04:50] *** Quits: rpkilby (~rpkilby@c-24-20-208-106.hsd1.or.comcast.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:04:51] <Guest67> it is a function that creates the xml
[10:04:52] <GinFuyou> So what if it does?
[10:05:52] <Guest67> not sure just unsure how to submit the form to voice()
[10:05:55] <GinFuyou> You usually you create html or json. Or you could create .exe bytestream, I don't see how it changes anything
[10:06:21] <GinFuyou> Guest67, let form action point to it's url
[10:06:33] <Guest67> ooh good idea let me try
[10:07:20] *** Quits: cellofellow (~user@166.70.50.58) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:08:12] <Guest67> ok no effect when changing to <form id='phoneform' action="/phone/voice/" method="post">
[10:08:21] <Guest67> it still calls my hard coded number
[10:08:26] <Guest67> not the number i type in
[10:12:17] <GinFuyou> well, you have to add\move form handling code to voice() obviously
[10:12:21] <Guest67> https://www.twilio.com/blog/a-phone-number-input-field-for-flask-forms
[10:12:31] <Guest67> scroll down to Form Creation and Handling
[10:13:03] <Guest67> they do something with the session?
[10:14:07] <Guest67> yes you are right
[10:14:34] *** Quits: gcain (~gcain@158.140.192.220) ()
[10:14:37] <GinFuyou> yes, I believe they save number in session so they can show it in another view
[10:15:02] <GinFuyou> Not sure why you'd do that in django this way, but maybe it fits flask logic better
[10:16:00] <Guest67> yea strange so would that be one way to go?
[10:16:57] <GinFuyou> Well, you don't need to show number, you need it to use it in voice, right?
[10:17:09] <Guest67> ah yes you're right
[10:18:10] <Guest67> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44915807/how-to-pass-a-form-value-to-another-view   ?
[10:19:12] <GinFuyou> m?
[10:20:06] <Guest67> right track with this or no?
[10:20:32] <GinFuyou> no, as I said just submit form to voice and you are done
[10:20:45] <GinFuyou> Or I'm missing a reason to do something more complex
[10:20:59] <Guest67> no you're not missing anything
[10:21:25] <Guest67> the thing though is the javascript ignores the actual django submit though
[10:22:27] <GinFuyou> I'm not sure what you mean by that. Django and JS kind of separated and don't really know of each other
[10:23:40] *** Joins: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood)
[10:24:21] <Guest67> if i delete the js it brings me to the /phone/voice/ page with the xml

[10:24:48] <Guest67> if i keep the js, it does not redirect me to the xml page
[10:25:06] <Guest67> it doesn't submit like it should with a normal form
[10:25:34] <GinFuyou> Do you mean you are using async (ajax) form submit in JS?
[10:25:51] <Guest67> the js seems to do the whole in browser calling capability where i can use my pc's mic to talk on the phone

[10:26:39] <Guest67> i am not a js person but yes there is some ajax involved
[10:27:04] <GinFuyou> Makes sense, server can't use mic via browser (without some help at least)
[10:27:24] <Guest67> right
[10:27:38] <GinFuyou> But either if it's normal form submit or ajax - it makes little difference to django
[10:28:22] <Guest67> ok makes sense
[10:29:57] <GinFuyou> so if your form is correct and form handling is correct, it will work both ways. Difference will be browser changing\reloading page or not
[10:31:14] <Guest67> interesting then my form handling must be wrong
[10:31:50] <GinFuyou> Well, I can't say without seeing current code
[10:35:10] <Guest67> https://dpaste.org/EP4M
[10:35:49] <Guest67> the html and js is pretty much identical to the flask library example
[10:37:10] <GinFuyou> I don't see neither change of form action, nor form handling code in voice()
[10:37:44] <Guest67> https://dpaste.org/M6RW
[10:37:53] <Guest67> form action change
[10:38:03] <Guest67> not sure how to do the form handling code in voice()
[10:38:47] <Guest67> does it mean i literally need to put form = PhoneForm inside of voice()?
[10:38:56] <Guest67> and do is_valid()
[10:40:16] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:41:20] <GinFuyou> yes, PhoneForm(request.POST) (if you do POST request), the validate form, then access input number from form.cleaned_data

[10:47:21] <Guest67> getting TwiML errors and when navigating to /phone/voice/ without submitting input The view phone.views.voice didn't return an HttpResponse object. It returned None instead.
[10:48:22] <Guest67> https://dpaste.org/fKdd
[10:50:31] <GinFuyou> when you navigate to it, you make a get request, so you need some response to return in this case
[10:51:07] <GinFuyou> For TwiML errors, I guess have to see what they say?
[10:51:24] <Guest67> print(phone_number) does not print anything
[10:51:38] <Guest67> basically it means it is not proper TwiML
[10:51:55] <Guest67> so should i change to POST in resp.dial method?
[10:52:32] <Guest67> the dial code makes the XML
[10:52:59] <Guest67> and if you are missing something like the 'to' number you get a not proper TwiML message
[10:53:15] <Guest67> or missing a quote in the TwiML
[10:55:53] <GinFuyou> does it say that form is valid? Inspect in devtools what is request body of form submit (network tab)

[11:01:33] <Guest31> How would i do the response thing from the GET?
[11:01:53] <Guest31> Should i change resp.dial method to POST?
[11:02:34] <GinFuyou> it's already in POST
[11:02:51] <Guest31> Oh god you're right
[11:03:14] <Guest31> So i can leave the dial method as GET
[11:03:39] <GinFuyou> You should add `return HttpResponse(<something>)` at the end of voice() to return something when you don't hit all ifs
[11:04:27] <GinFuyou> if you want to dial number from the form, it has to be in POST
[11:05:43] <Guest31> Ok

[22:05:15] <dalley> whoops, slightly mistyped something https://dpaste.org/A8xp
[22:08:43] <dalley> basically I have a base class with a custom manager, which also has some custom queryset functionality, and I want a base class with its own custom manager to inherit both the behavior defined on the first manager, as well as the queryset customization -- without explicitly having every new subclass do the CustomManagerN.from_queryset(CustomQuerySet) dance

[23:16:16] <shangxiao> dalley: interesting theory… have you tested it to see if it works?
[23:16:33] <dalley> shangxiao, it *seems* to work, it just feels dirty
[23:19:11] <shangxiao> dalley: so just reviewing how managers work from the docs… as long as your customised querysets & managers work on those models I think it should be ok
