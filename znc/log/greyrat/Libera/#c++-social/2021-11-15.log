[11:49:10] <onizu> hi
[11:51:10] <onizu> Do you think each new s/w product that we build (for selling) should have its own unique domain for the website OR it's not necessary and we can launch it under the main company/developer profile website?
[11:55:41] <jotham> you should always put a product on its own brand identity

[12:06:23] <onizu> ok
[12:06:49] <jotham> if it works, you can financially execute it as a discrete entitly
[12:07:00] <jotham> and if it fails you can disavow any knowledge of it
[12:07:04] <jotham> and mostly it'll fail
[12:07:11] <jotham> good programming does
[12:07:11] <onizu> I'm concerned that there would be too many domains then.. (considering the product is an addon / plugin / extension for a third-party proprietory software)
[12:07:18] <jotham> good programming doesn't make a working product
[12:07:23] <jotham> sales and consumer demand does
[12:07:30] <jotham> don't be
[12:07:49] <jotham> every good idea should be treated as a discrete position for the organisation
[12:07:59] <jotham> the market is ruthless
[12:08:07] <jotham> you never want to be associated with your own good ideas
[12:08:19] <jotham> i know that sounds fucked
[12:08:21] *** Quits: lionkor (~lionkor@beammp/staff/lionkor) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:08:23] <jotham> but that's how the market works
[12:08:25] <onizu> ok, I get that point
[12:09:01] <onizu> only in this case, there would be a new add-on in every couple of months.. I'm not sure in that case if each should have its own domain :S
[12:09:14] <jotham> wait, explain that
[12:09:30] <onizu> (i'm an independent consultant)
[12:09:37] <jotham> sure but please continue
[12:10:55] <onizu> k, as I said, the product(s) in my case are going to be addons (or plugins or extensions as they are called) to some other giant proprietory software
[12:11:34] <onizu> people who would use it would be already having the license of that parent software
[12:13:27] <onizu> so I'm not talking about _a_ product that I'll be building for years.. but there could be new ones coming up every few months. So is it viable to build and maintain separate domains for each one of them?
