[01:00:16] <emanuele6> i didn't know "command" was a general term :/
[01:00:36] <twkm> it isn't general, it is specific, it just seems to mean more than you expect.
[01:00:43] <kurahaupo> It's not "general", it's defined quite specifically in the Shell grammar
[01:01:05] <kurahaupo> But yes, it means more than just a simple command

[01:04:01] <earnestly> bash does, posix doesn't
[01:04:19] <kurahaupo> The_Blode: "}" is a keyword and therefore only exists when preceded by ; or newline or other special cases
[01:04:20] <emanuele6> oh, wait, maybe not: `echo hi; echo hello' is not a command, but `{ echo hi; echo hello; }' is
[01:04:22] <emanuele6> right?
[01:04:26] <earnestly> The_Blode: Also I hope you're quoting that "$file" in the real example.  You might also want to use `rm -- "$file"' too
[01:04:50] <earnestly> emanuele6: Latter is a compound command, first is two commands
[01:05:02] <emanuele6> right
[01:05:04] <kurahaupo> The_Blode: "$@"  inside a function refers to the arguments to the function
[01:05:04] <Nintendo> "removeFile is 
[01:05:13] <emanuele6> ok, i didn't know that was the meaning of command
[01:05:16] <Nintendo> "removeFile" is longer than "rm"
[01:05:23] <Nintendo> What is really going on here?
[01:05:25] <earnestly> Also camelCase ;(
[01:05:31] <The_Blode> This is true Nintendo 
[01:05:41] <emanuele6> basically, anything that can be targeted by `time' is a command
[01:06:02] * kurahaupo prefers chamomile case, for making tea
[01:06:12] <earnestly> plan9pilled
[01:06:16] <The_Blode> So if I call the function like this removeFile("$file") is this a valid call?
[01:06:17] <earnestly> nospacesnocase
[01:06:17] <emanuele6> i thougth command just "external command", my bad
[01:06:28] <kurahaupo> The_Blode: no ()
[01:06:33] <emanuele6> s/just/just meant/
[01:06:41] <earnestly> The_Blode: You should go through the bash guide mentioned in the topic *at least*
[01:06:45] <The_Blode> removeFile $file    ?
[01:06:51] <Nintendo> earnestly++
[01:06:53] <kurahaupo> The_Blode: removeFile "$file"
[01:07:05] <The_Blode> I see. Slightly odd to my eyes
[01:07:10] <The_Blode> Let's go that a try
[01:07:12] <kurahaupo> The_Blode: the same way as you would call any other command
[01:07:33] <earnestly> The_Blode: Don't worry with POSIX sh until you have gone through it as it's quite easy to fill in the blanks later
[01:07:37] <kurahaupo> The_Blode: don't let the terminology "function" fool you
[01:07:53] <earnestly> The_Blode: (Remember, don't think of the shell as a programming language)
[01:08:07] <The_Blode> My bad
[01:08:17] <kurahaupo> earnestly: I do, I just know it's not a C-derived one
[01:08:18] <The_Blode> It feels like a programming language though
[01:08:22] <twkm> functions are merely "scripts" (commands) that are defined as part of your larger script (command, yes even another function).
[01:08:37] <The_Blode> So essentially BASH is just a cluster of commands
[01:08:43] <earnestly> kurahaupo: It's not like any other typical programming language, from algol to apl
[01:08:46] <The_Blode> Is that a fair description?
[01:08:49] <twkm> that's all a shell really is.
[01:08:54] <earnestly> kurahaupo: Well, maybe snobol has similarities
[01:08:58] *** catern- is now known as catern
[01:09:25] <kurahaupo> # f(){ echo i F; g(){ echo new G;} } ; g(){ echo old G ;}; g ; f; g
[01:09:26] <earnestly> The_Blode: bash is a command language, it runs commands and provides some provision to run them under conditions
[01:09:27] <shbot> kurahaupo: old G
[01:09:27] <shbot> kurahaupo: i F
[01:09:27] <shbot> kurahaupo: new G
[01:10:13] <earnestly> The_Blode: It also has mechanisms to group commands and control redirection; i.e. facilities to run commands in various ways
[01:10:31] *** Quits: apos (~apos@gateway/tor-sasl/apos) (Quit: Bye!)
[01:10:58] <kurahaupo> earnestly: the C family is still part of the wider Algol clan, along with Pascal. 
[01:11:17] <earnestly> kurahaupo: I'm not disputing that, in fact I mentioned algol for that reason
[01:11:48] <earnestly> The_Blode: The distinction is probably a bit superficial but it helps to prevent yourself from being trapped in ways of thinking that programming languages typically need
[01:12:18] <earnestly> The_Blode: Such as why most people don't understand quoting in the shell precisely because they think of strings like they exist in typical programming languages
[01:12:54] *** Joins: m0viefreak (~asdf@user/m0viefreak)
[01:13:19] <The_Blode> Thanks guys so now I'm passing arguments to my functions
[01:13:28] <The_Blode> I guess I can only address one value with $@ right?
[01:13:34] <The_Blode> Can I address two or more?
[01:13:36] <twkm> "$@"
[01:13:43] <kurahaupo> But we teach our CS students a very narrow view of the world by only teaching them languages from the Algol clan. Engineers also meet the Fortran clan (including Basic) but it's rare to meet someone who knows, say, PostScript, or Forth, or Prolog
[01:13:46] <The_Blode> Yes apologies
[01:13:46] <twkm> it expands to all the arguments.
[01:13:51] <twkm> !$@
[01:13:51] <greybot> The difference between $@ and $*: "$@" (quoted) expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ... while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c..." where c is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@". The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}" or "${array[*]}". Unquoted $* and $@ are undefined; DO NOT use.
[01:14:11] <kurahaupo> The_Blode: "$@" is all of the parameters
[01:14:14] <earnestly> The_Blode: Are you aware of "$1", "$2", ... "${10}", "${11}", etc?
[01:14:15] <The_Blode> Thanks twkm let me test

[01:16:20] <kurahaupo> Shell & C started in the 1970's, so almost anything you think "seems like language X" will be because X got it from Shell or C, not the other way round

[01:21:22] <kurahaupo> No offence taken; it's just common that people who haven't lived through history don't always know about it
[01:21:28] <earnestly> Don't worry, bash stole everything from ksh anyway

[01:27:27] <kurahaupo> twkm: the great innovation of the shell was to have the same language as both the interactive CLI and as the batch processing (aka scripting) language
[01:27:55] <earnestly> bell labs was too good for us
[01:28:08] <kurahaupo> Even MSDOS's COMMAND.COM got that wrong in the 1980's

[01:29:28] <earnestly> I don't think there is anyone, or anything, that can do better without getting it horrifically wrong in other aspects
[01:29:35] <emanuele6> wikipedia says that perl *borrows* features from sh, not that it *stole* them :o
[01:29:59] <twkm> plan9 tried to innovate while still being similar, but nobody really uses it.
[01:30:06] <kurahaupo> Typical batch processing languages of the time tended to look like macro processing files, which is the main reason for dollar signs when expanding variables but not when assigning to them

[09:59:59] <neshpion> probably

[13:37:14] <cousteau> I'll try to remember that 
[13:38:23] <earnestly> In normal languages, quoted text is treated differently.  E.g. Algol allows whitespace in identifiers, this is because all whitespace is removed before tokenizing

[13:40:07] <cousteau> I usually add quotes when assigning out of habit / superstition

[17:36:45] <omegatron> as I said, good luck with performing certain operations on the source code, including trying to debug it, if you don't use appropiate spacing and single character variables ..  I don't like this aspect of work and try to avoid/nullify it by using at least three-letter variables and space around variables etc.
[17:39:09] <earnestly> Mathematics often uses single letter characters due to the level of abstraction it involves.  Using 'idx' or 'index' for what 'i' is sufficient for is simply bad form and introduces noise that can otherwise be obviated by an experienced programmer

[17:52:03] <kurahaupo> I do not expect every language to have the same idioms. Java tells you to spell everything out longhand. C (and Go) prefer the reverse, within reason.

[17:54:52] <kurahaupo> Use names that explain expectations. If the scope is only 2 lines, that's enough on its own, it doesn't need any more purposive explanation

[19:15:01] <zubeida> greycat: oh! it's a syntax then. i see. bash manual mentions `2>` without hinting that it's special syntax. it's clear now.
[19:15:04] <zubeida> greycat: thanks.
[19:15:06] <greycat> you're allowed to have or to omit the space *after* the redirection operator, because the shell knows there has to be a filename next
[19:15:35] <zubeida> greycat: i always thought that `2>` was a conventional way of writing `2 > ` and kept running into errors.

[23:52:41] <greycat> I'd guess "not a lot".

[23:54:21] <FreeBDSM> the norm should've been that exit command actually passes not 1 numeric code, but a pair of numeric code + optional string
[23:54:32] <geirha> as far as I know, the heirloom code is the one solaris used for its /bin/sh
[23:54:54] <kurahaupo> FreeBDSM: how would that be communicated between processes?
[23:55:39] <e36freak> they would yell it loudly at each other across the room
[23:56:22] <FreeBDSM> kurahaupo: I don't really know the answer, but something tells me "the same way you return a tuple from within function in most programming languages
[23:56:38] <twkm> it is possible had they defined it that way, but they didn't.

[23:57:07] <shbot> kurahaupo: 1=bc 2=
[23:57:08] <FreeBDSM> that's my thinking and that's what I meant: the initial design was just poor, stupid
[23:57:43] <twkm> get out your very small computer and design glorious things.

[23:57:49] <kurahaupo> FreeBDSM: It's a kernel call that copies information between processes
[23:58:30] <twkm> (with little memory and not even 1 mips)
[23:58:42] <kurahaupo> The normal thing  in programming languages back then was precisely to return a status value in a machine register
[23:58:44] <FreeBDSM> kurahaupo: so?
[23:59:07] <FreeBDSM> copy 2 pieces of information between processes at once
[23:59:20] <twkm> they might have done otherwise, but the memory was cramped and the cycles not too abundant.
[23:59:21] <greycat> that's why C can return a pointer to a struct, but not a struct
[23:59:40] <kurahaupo> It mimicked the way that function calls worked at the time
[23:59:46] <twkm> c can return a struct, for the last 3 decades.
