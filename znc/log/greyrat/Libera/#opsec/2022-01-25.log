[15:30:02] <Joanna> Hi everyone

[15:31:32] <Joanna> It seems like a lot of people in irc lately are advocating for population control. I’m not sure what this is all about...
[15:34:02] <Joanna>  I find it rather disturbing that mass murder is such a popular idea. This can’t lead to anything good..
[15:34:27] *** Quits: chipox (~chipox@97.13.132.77.rev.sfr.net) (Client Quit)
[15:34:36] <vaio> hi Joanna.  What do you mean "population control" ?
[15:34:56] <vaio> and how is that related to mass murdering ?
[15:35:48] <Joanna> I was talking to some people in other security channel earlier and several of them seemed to think that a lot of people should be gotten rid of in various ways
[15:35:58] <vaio> well, i guess you mean poeple saying "they are too many humans on this earth; we cause global warming; in order to fight it the best way would be to reduce population number" ?
[15:36:08] <vaio> ah
[15:36:30] <Joanna> I don’t consume mainstream media so I have no idea what is being hyped lately...
[15:36:45] <vaio> im not sure either
[15:37:10] <Joanna> Well it was said vaguely and not so vaguely
[15:38:18] <vaio> all i know about is that some medical people would like to let unvaccinated people die... (in some countries at least) other than that, im not sure
[15:38:38] <Joanna> For the record I don’t trust people pushing the global warming narrative. I don’t see them cutting back on energy usage nor planting trees...
[15:40:14] <vaio> see the cop26 or something people :)
[15:40:28] <vaio> going to the meeting using their private jet and all
[15:40:44] <Joanna> Well it’s kind of funny that people who want to reduce population don’t like “pandemics “ maybe they want other people to be part of the population reduction not them :)
[15:41:33] <Joanna> I’ve heard al gore has a large climate controlled home and a private jet..
[15:41:50] <vaio> heh
[15:42:39] <Joanna> That was another hot button topic is daring to suggest that people give up climate control to save energy:)
[15:43:33] <Joanna> They can’t grasp the concept of giving up conspicuous consumption.
[15:44:43] <Joanna> Have you had a chance to check out the Corbett report in topic? The podcast is really good .
[15:52:46] <vaio> nope, i didn't.  will try to listen to it today

[17:26:36] <Joanna> I’ve been going backwards I think I’m on the ones from 2018 now :)
[17:33:53] <JimBuntu> 'population control' is one of those things with various meanings.  Their are those who want to control the number of the population... those who want to control the population... and those that want to do both.  Pretty sure the only reason to want to do both is because large numbers are considered difficult to manage or so that they can have a longer run at it.
[17:33:57] <JimBuntu> Good morning Joanna 
[17:35:20] <JimBuntu> We are reaching the point where we now have 'all of our eggs in one basket'... if thinking of people as the eggs and Earth as the basket.  I'm all for reduce/reuse/recycle... and I am also for making more baskets and spreading out the eggs.
