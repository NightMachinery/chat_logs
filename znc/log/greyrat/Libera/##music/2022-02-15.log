[00:27:10] <R2robot> that intro kinda sounded like Friday the 13th O.o
[00:35:18] <Jan> macrobat thanks for your earlier answer
[00:35:27] <Jan> I did recognise that it's sort of all over the place
[00:36:56] <macrobat> it can probably be interpreted in several ways
[00:37:49] <Jan> I know someone whose daughter is learning violin
[00:37:56] <Jan> she wants to play big orchestras
[00:38:10] <Jan> and they know I play for a living but I really don't do this sort of stuff!
[00:39:04] <Jan> are you getting 9/8 from listening to the string backing in 3s, and the lead horns in 4s?

[00:46:04] <macrobat> hmm, multi-timesigs would be too much for me to keep track of
[00:47:57] <Jan> it's pretty common in orchestral stuff
[00:48:02] <Jan> but that's very complicated for a movie theme
[00:48:09] <Jan> I mean that really is VERY complicated.
[00:48:37] <Jan> I mean harmonically it isn't, it's a standard big soaring horn tune full of romance and heroism, it's a marvel movie score
[00:48:52] <Jan> but as you say the timing is all over the place

[07:06:47] <piercedwater> i like dark beers, in particular a beer called Shinerbock
[07:06:57] <piercedwater> pretty much all i drink
[07:07:24] <MusicalDillo> Shiner is good beer
[07:07:29] <piercedwater> :)
[07:07:30] <sdragon> I generally prefer stouts, personally
[07:08:10] <MusicalDillo> just found Shiner Light Blonde which is pretty tasty for a light beer
[07:08:45] <piercedwater> i found it to be tasty, but too light for my liking
