[01:05:17] <Bayes> how can I two things to the same hook in one line?
[01:05:19] <wasamasa> because so far every attempt I've seen punts on implementing the actually useful emacs APIs or entirely breaks compatibility
[01:05:36] <pjb> VincentV`: now, there's an implementation of emacs lisp in CL in Hemlock (but not the whole emacs library obviously).
[01:05:42] <dale> Bayes: I recommend not inserting a line break.
[01:05:51] <wasamasa> guilemacs being the exception
[01:06:03] <technomancy> wasamasa: does remacs count?
[01:06:11] <pjb> VincentV`: there's also an emacs-CL implementation of CL written in emacs lisp that has bit-rotten since lexical binding was introduced in emacs lisp.
[01:06:11] <wasamasa> rust is not a lisp, lol
[01:06:28] <technomancy> oh, I thought you meant rewrites in general
[01:06:39] <wasamasa> no, just the "My lisp is better than elisp" kind
[01:06:42] <pjb> VincentV`: wasamasa's question is the most important: GNU emacs maintainers won't switch to CL. 
[01:06:43] <dale> Oh, remacs is unmaintained now, too bad.
[01:06:52] <VincentV`> pjb: cool, I will take a look
[01:07:07] <technomancy> dale: who could have foreseen that coming
[01:07:11] <dale> lol
[01:07:19] <wasamasa> huh, is it
[01:07:21] <pjb> VincentV`: so while the best option IMO< is to write a C11 compiler that can compile GNU emacs C sources, targetting Common Lisp, so that you can compile GNU emacs into a CL image.
[01:07:38] <pjb> VincentV`: I started such a compiler a few years ago. So far only the pre-processor is written.  
[01:07:58] <parsnip> wasamasa: all your predictions about remacs have been proven false /s
[01:08:25] <pjb> VincentV`: in all cases, there's a serious lack of workforce.  Your best shot here would be to resell your startup for a 3-comma, or at least a serious 2-comma, and hire people to do the work.
[01:08:30] <pjb> VincentV`: or win the lotto.
[01:08:47] <parsnip> (explanation of joke: wasamasa triages visitors whining more people aren't working on reimplementations like remacs, guilemacs, etc)
[01:09:33] <pjb> VincentV`: notice that one solution can be nowadays to embed ECL (libecl.so) as a plugin into emacs.  Then to do enough cross FFI to be able to write easily emacs extensions in CL.
[01:09:58] <xristos> sounds like a major pain in the ass
[01:10:02] <wasamasa> yeah
[01:10:04] <xristos> also, ECL being pretty bad
[01:10:07] <pjb> the embedding is the easy part, the enough cross FFI the hard part…
[01:10:22] <wasamasa> you now have to know CL, elisp and the bridge
[01:10:36] <wasamasa> and honestly, most packages are small enough that using elisp isn't the burden
[01:10:40] <pjb> what would we not do to avoid elisp and use CL instead!
[01:10:41] <VincentV`> pjb: OK, having a CL core would make it more hackable and kind and more powerful I would guess.
[01:10:56] <dale> Ah, and here's where the discussion of "what's happening with this project" somehow gets side tracked by talking about allegations against RMS, excellent.  https://github.com/remacs/remacs/issues/1571
[01:11:20] <pjb> wasamasa: currently, we have fun with slime-eval and this exchange lisp data between emacs lisp and common lisp thru print/read strings..
[01:12:47] <Bayes> any idea why I'm getting this error ? https://pastebin.com/fc1pHqLq
[01:13:03] <pjb> VincentV`: the only serious solution is this compile C into CL solution, since then, CL code is seen as C code from GNU emacs, emacs lisp code and third party libraries will run the same, GNU emacs maintainers will still use C and maintain it; we will just have to recompile the new versions, with a minimal patch to interface CL with elisp. 
[01:13:04] <VincentV`> pjb: Well, the community/maintainership issues aside, my main question is, if you had your core in CL, and all core API's in CL, could you then consider all the emacs packages as CL as well, given that you can tweak your compiler within reason.
[01:13:11] <dale> I am surprised to hear that one of the two big obstacles to the remacs project was that it broke on macOS at some point, and no one knew how to fix it.  Surprised only in that the project had a lot of macOS developers, I guess.
[01:13:39] <pjb> VincentV`: no, the idea is that the core is still written and maintained by GNU emacs maintainers in C.

[01:14:11] <dale> Bayes: It's just :config (set-face-background ...) (set-face-foreground ...) ...
[01:14:16] <dale> Bayes: use-package is a little weird in this way.
[01:14:27] <pjb> VincentV`:  one funny thing would be to use that C->CL compiler on ecl, which then would compile CL->C and use gcc to compile the C.
[01:15:00] <Bayes> dale thanks, that did it. weird indeed, cause for hooks I'd definitely need ((xx) (xxx)) etc
[01:15:08] <dale> From a project management standpoint, starting remacs by porting the easy stuff first was maybe not the best idea.

[02:07:14] <tali713> you can also C-x r f <char> to save all the current frames to a register.  but again, this is volatile unless you take further action.

[04:08:14] <dragestil> it can just pass it on
[04:08:29] <dale> dragestil: I'm not *trying* to be annoying, just trying to understand what you're asking, BTW. :)
[04:08:57] <dragestil> dale: it can send a request to the mailing list archive, get the message, and display it to me
[04:08:58] <dale> dragestil: My belief is that Gmane is a gateway between NNTP and mailing lists, so I think it stores all the messages from the mailing lists, and forwards NNTP posts to the mailing lists, as well.

[04:09:54] <dale> dragestil: That is an interesting idea, but I am 99% sure it doesn't do that, particularly since it would need code to deal with every different possible mailing list archive software, including keeping track of unique IDs for all messages across changes to the archiving software.  Even then, some mailing lists probably don't have archives.

[04:11:15] <dragestil> gmane.io must cost quite a bit to maintain then
[04:12:03] <dragestil> also, is gmane.io the only service in existence of its kind?
[04:12:04] <dale> dragestil: I have a lot of uncertainty around Gmane because it's been up and down over the past several years, though I think the NNTP interface has remained most consistently available.  There was a time when it was a fantastic web-based archive of all mailing lists, but that time passed, several years gone now I think.
[04:12:05] <alphapapa[m]> GMANE receives emails from the respective mailing lists, and sends new ones on behalf of posters who use it.

[04:13:01] <alphapapa[m]> Yes, the GMANE Web UI is sadly not maintained anymore, but the NNTP service has remained usable and is a valuable resource.  There's some company that provides the servers and bandwidth, you can read about it in the old discussions about GMANE on its blog, when the original maintainer turned it over to them.

[04:14:51] <dragestil> yeah, the nntp interface, accessed from gnus looks quite cool. it reminds me of google groups before i stopped using google

[04:29:37] <dale> shrysr: You may need to make sure that whatever Python interpreter Emacs is going to run when editing your Pandas-using programs has Pandas installed.  For example, if you've got Pandas in some virtualenv, make sure that venv's "python" is first on Emacs's path and/or the actual PATH environment inside your Emacs, because that somehow makes its way to Pyright.  Pyright needs to know which
[04:29:39] <dale> Python/venv to look at for completions.
[04:30:11] <shrysr> AHA. the venv directory is to be defined for pyright

[04:30:23] <dale> shrysr: I'm not actually sure how it gets to Pyright.  It's possible you *must* use a virtualenv and then set the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable in Emacs, not sure.
[04:30:35] <dale> shrysr: Keep hitting it in the face with lsp-restart-workspace until the behavior improves.
[04:31:07] <dale> There is also a way to configure Pyright for your project outside of Emacs, I think.  Let's be honest, there are probably no fewer than six ways to configure Pyright when using it through LSP in Emacs.
[04:31:40] <dale> You can put something in, like, a Pyright configuration file in the project, or maybe in setup.ini?  And/or pyproject.toml?  Pyright docs have more info IIRC.
[04:32:02] <shrysr> yes, only a few options in lsp-pyright.el it seems lsp-pyright-locate-venv will look for venv local to the project folder. I have my venv's centrally. 
[04:32:29] <dale> shrysr: There may be some not-specific-to-Pyright emacs-lsp thing that you set somewhere... *waves hands vaguely*

[10:52:48] <lennyy> (excuse my bad terms im new 2 emacs)
[10:53:50] <ext0l> a 'frame' in emacs is what most applications call a window
[10:54:07] <alphapapa[m]> So the top right window is the result, a "taxonomy" of results from an org-ql query.  In the lower left window, you can see the definition of the taxy using a macro, the ((planning-date todo) (priority) todo) part.  You can see that structure reflected in the top-right window, as items with a planning date are then classified by their TODO, and items with no planning date but with a priority are classified with that, and items without either
[10:54:07] <alphapapa[m]> a planning date or priority are only classified by their TODO.
[10:54:40] <ext0l> a 'window' in emacs is part of a frame; split-screen would be having multiple windows in a single frame

[11:15:56] <corwin> extra blank line between first sentence and main body, maybe?
[11:16:00] <alphapapa[m]> I think it is a pretty powerful abstraction
[11:16:30] <corwin> i'm thinking about whether I could use this instead of hash tables for the tile lists.
[11:16:58] <alphapapa[m]> mm, I'm not sure about that... I think it's more suitable for arranging data for presentation than internal stuff, but maybe I misunderstand
[11:17:07] <corwin> right now the way I "file" the "varients" (versions of a tile kept in case of "non default" game circumstance)
[11:17:15] <corwin> it's not... good.
[11:17:37] <corwin> this is a semi presentation set.
[11:17:55] <alphapapa[m]> I think what you would do with taxy is something like, convert the hash-table to a list of items and then taxy-fill with those items, then display the list with taxy-magit-section

[11:18:58] <alphapapa[m]> man that sounds powerful
[11:19:21] <corwin> see how it might be useful for me to have something to sort incoming rows as I take them in across whatever files the author thought it made sense to devide the map tiles into?

[11:48:40] <alphapapa[m]> ahh... I admire what you're doing, but writing Lisp in JS syntax makes me cry ;)
[11:48:56] <alphapapa[m]> a necessary evil I suppose in this case
[11:49:22] <corwin> yaaa, as you can see, basically there's quite a bit of hard-coding of lisp here.  Right now I'm working on something that generalizes the requests so I can ignore diff between header args vs query string etc and avoid code duplication or whatever, but.
[11:49:32] <alphapapa[m]> that it can be done so easily is a testament to the simplicity of Lisp, I suppose
[11:50:31] <alphapapa[m]> so, Corwin... /this/ is your million-dollar idea?  /Really?!/  :P  (haha j/k)
[11:50:57] <corwin> what I really need to do is have some "higher level" elisp gen functiona, et.g. let that looks like function let(binds=[],code=null) { if (!binds && !code) return ''; ... }
[11:51:28] <corwin> heh. counting on it, most def.
[11:51:44] <alphapapa[m]> if you keep going with this you're eventually going to have a full-blown Lisp interpreter in JS, and then you can just write actual Lisp in JS that then gets converted into JS and then back to Lisp and...
[11:51:52] <corwin> I mean, has to be an huuuuuuge untapped market for JSON to elisp transformation.
[11:52:40] <corwin> alphapapa[m]: maybe, but probably via emacs.  my current idea is that we can call elisp programs wrapped in named org blocks, those can use tabular and other data from each person's emacs session.
[11:52:54] <alphapapa[m]> that's pretty cool
[11:53:14] <corwin> what I'm doing right now includes starting the support for a "user auth token" so people could have different sessions by connecting to different server instances.
[11:53:30] <corwin> if/when that works I'll put a POC live
[11:53:56] <alphapapa[m]> are you doing any of this in Clojure?  I wonder if some of your work could be shared with the organice project's low-level stuff
[11:54:44] <corwin> i haven't worked with clojure but I'd be willing to look.  Once it works at all I'd like to get it "interoperable" with as many similar projects as possible.
[11:55:00] <corwin> It's really just a UI layer for emacs/your notebook?
[11:55:41] <alphapapa[m]> um, I think so, but they are doing some supporting work in lower-level code, like a Clojure Org parser
[11:55:51] <alphapapa[m]> and an EBNF spec or something like that
[11:56:24] <corwin> My idea is that your "VM" (personal or shared emacs session) could have sjjome "template UIs", implemented the way we use readtheorg and such but these turn the ord-doc into web UX, sorta how colums mode does for org.

[11:57:20] <alphapapa[m]> boy that sounds nifty
[11:58:22] <corwin> I'm not a great javascript (or web ux) dev but I know enough react to be dangerous to the teams I code review at work :P  I might start there.
[11:58:32] <corwin> Like, even go as far as next.js.
[11:58:36] <corwin> I have no shame.
[11:59:18] <alphapapa[m]> hahaha
[11:59:22] <corwin> (I don't actually know nextjs yet but I do know I can use it to create "static" versions of my react components)
[11:59:43] <corwin> meaning without need of the nodejs backend server
[12:00:07] <corwin> except, of course, for traditional front-end to back-end e.g. SPA/AJAX calls
[12:01:08] <corwin> but honestly it doesn't matter, i'm thinking react because there's so much "not bad looking" ux to steal^Dlearn from and enhance.
[12:02:53] <corwin> alphapapa[m]: anyway, my actual question was around the approach I mentioned for some "higher level" lisp generation functions. I think that could make the hard-to-readness less.
[12:03:04] <alphapapa[m]> yeah probably so
[12:04:51] <corwin> OK, I think I'll give that a shot.  It's one of those coin flip things.  It's hard to say whether it's yack shaving-  clearly the "elisp generation" part is a bit fun.

[17:36:48] <sakiv1> Hi everyone. I am on manjaro, and am trying to get xwidget-webkit working. Emacs is compiled with xwidgets and I can open a website in it. But I think some dependencies are missing, and I am unable to do very much. Can somebody point to what dependencies might be required other than gtk3, which is installed, of course.

[17:39:38] <humasect> sakiv1: can you show me an example? ive intsalled manjaro and emacs with xwidgets yesterday, so i can try it here
[17:39:40] <irek> mtex: personally I would advice against live preview for css because it encourages development by try and error instead by understanding.  Anyway, tools like live-server and browser-sync are available, good luck
[17:40:36] <humasect> irek: the dev cycle, is something i miss, edit-compile-run/test, which i think is very important to development process for many projects. live dev feels more like throwing paint.

But know, looking at this, I am not so sure. Can it be done? The auto-overlays lib is a tad heavy for this, I feel.

[22:20:29] <Bayes> This essentially means that, even though restoring the frameset works on the TTY (providing desktop-restore-forces-onscreen is NIL), it NEVER runs. So we get the full desktop, but none of the frames.

[22:51:54] <Bayes> so I need some guidance before I start hacking this up
[22:52:31] <Bayes> I'd like to create my own "IDE", i.e. my own setup of windows and buffers
[22:53:13] <Bayes> say, having two vertical buffers starting from the left, and having three horizontal buffers on the right with dired, magit, and a shell process
[22:53:23] <Bayes> what's the recommended way to achieve that?
[22:53:29] <ville> unfortunately windows and buffers is what sucks the most about emacs.
[22:53:56] <bremner> and keybindings.
[22:54:01] <bremner> apparently.
[22:54:05] <Bayes> the major mode I'm using suggests to customize this via "display-buffer-alist"
[22:54:41] <Bayes> (here http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#Controlling-buffer-display)
[22:54:47] <Bayes> is that the recommended way ?
[22:54:52] <ville> even if you don't install any non-default packages, but especially once you do. the non-default packages can have pretty wild ideas what they want to do with windows and buffer and sometimes don't have a direct way to disable their bad behaviour
[22:55:25] <VincentVega> Bayes: I recommend checking out shackle, it might help along the way. And also this https://melpa.org/#/?q=window configuration
[22:55:33] <VincentVega> but I won't vouch for any of those
[22:56:27] <ville> wonder if emacs could take a similar approach to what X does; the first client to register as a window manager gets to decide, every other client merely sends requests that the WM may or may not honor
[22:58:12] <VincentVega> Bayes: maybe this even https://melpa.org/#/persp-mode and this https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el

[23:05:27] <VincentVega> Bayes: Well, I didn't have any need for this, so I was just throwing around suggestions. What exactly do you want to accomplish? Say, compilation info buffer will just pop up in the right place (and you can use shackle if you don't like it). And there was some tree-navigation alternative aka nerd-tree from vim, which shows you a tree on the left side of the project and everything, but I am using helm and would never think of going with
[23:05:27] <VincentVega> that type of thing now. What else is missing? And what languages are you planning to use? Because I am pretty sure LSP-mode has some pretty ide features these days, overlay stuff, completions.
[23:06:10] <Bayes> VincentVega basically this http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#Controlling-buffer-display
[23:07:07] <Bayes> I was thinking of maybe having treemacs on the left, two vertical source code buffers at the center, and then having three horizontal buffers (a shell, dired, something more) on the right
[23:08:09] <Bayes> and I figured it would put all that in a defun in my init file so I can start a new emacs session and just do M-x myide to have a set up I like

[23:27:46] <aindilis> hi, I am trying to learn OpenCYC and SubL (a Common Lisp-like programming langauge used with OpenCYC).  I have downloaded the documentation for it off of archive.org.  I was wondering if Emacs had:
[23:27:52] <aindilis> any tools that would help me search through the documentation in an orderly fashion, and make it easy to open up and view the files.  The best feature would be a log of when I opened and closed and read different files.
[23:27:53] <aindilis> I've have probably 70% of this system in various code I've written over the years, but I see that Emacs has ~5K packages now, that might contain something better than my custom software.

[23:33:58] <aindilis> I have written some basic search tools that grep through pertinent files.  I also have Namazu setup to search them.  Lastly, I've written a CYC-mode that allows me to run lots of queries on OpenCYC, like get comment for cyc-constant at point.
