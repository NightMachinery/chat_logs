[00:01:02] <dude12312414> the problem is, how do you explain limits without explaining limits
[00:01:48] <dude12312414> the stuff that makes real numbers different from rational numbers is how they behave with respect to limits
[00:02:05] <Cale> My take would be that it's better just to explain limits, and probably a bunch of calculus, prior to doing anything involving the logarithm
[00:03:03] <XCode> my question is as follows. Let X = C_1 x C_2. We have the cycle class map z^1(X) --> H^2(X,Z) n H^{1,1}(X,C). If we use Kunneth we find expansion for H^2(X,Z). I want to know when is it true that H^{1,1}(X,Z) n {H^1(C_1,C) otimes H^1(C_2,C)} = 0.

[00:09:51] <Cale> tempate: They don't really define it in a way that would let you determine very much. It's fine to say that x^(1/n) is a number y such that y^n = x, however, what's to say that such a number exists? Moreover, what is the meaning of x^a when a is not a rational number? They sort of take for granted that's a thing a lot of the time.
[00:09:52] <tempate> Yeah, that rings a bell
[00:10:59] <Cale> Note that in the rational numbers, there is no square root of 2, and so anything you do to show that there is a square root of 2 in the real numbers has got to involve some property of the real numbers that the rational numbers don't share.

[00:16:32] <tempate> the problem is that math is seen and taught as a set of facts you memorize and apply to exercises
[00:16:49] <tempate> making it boring
[00:17:16] <dude12312414> Before calculus, log(x) is the function that returns the number the calculator gives when you press the log button
[00:17:36] <dude12312414> lol
[00:18:03] <tempate> I believe it should be taught as the art of thinking. Kids should be given problems they don't know how to solve and just get asked to think about them and try to solve them
[00:18:20] <greenbagels> In my mind logarithms should be taught at the same moment exponential functions are introduced
[00:18:24] <Cale> dude12312414: Yeah, it's just such an intellectually bankrupt way of introducing mathematics
[00:18:33] <greenbagels> And the notion of a functions inverse should be introduced before either
[00:19:45] <Cale> The whole problem begins with stripping out the proofs of everything. If, as a teacher of mathematics, you're required to convince students that the things you're saying follow from specified assumptions, then you can't get away with nearly as much.

[00:26:16] <somiaj> I just hear a lot of gatekeeping. I don't think adding more rigor at that level is the answer to improving math education.

[00:28:20] <Cale> Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:28] <greenbagels> There's a narrative in moving from naturals to integers to rationals to reals
[00:28:32] <somiaj> I also think the logic is there, it was in all of my classes in a very underfunded state, it is a matter that most students ignore it, and just want the 'steps'
[00:28:59] <Cale> I don't think it really is, or even could be, in many cases.
[00:29:26] <greenbagels> somiaj: I imagine by the time they're in college it's such an ingrained habit
[00:29:33] <tempate> I go back to what I was saying before: math at that level should be more about problem solving than about learning how numbers and functions behave
[00:29:53] <isekaijin> tempate: At all levels, really.
[00:29:54] <greenbagels> See problem, think of steps or formulae or technique or what have you
[00:30:04] <Cale> tempate: I might agree, depending on what you mean by problem solving :)
[00:30:06] <isekaijin> I find it to care about abstract definitions that don't lead to solving actual problems.
[00:30:19] <somiaj> The bigger issue is the social issue, common core was a great idea, with terrible implementation. Teachers need to be better trained, and there needs to be more consistant messagaing to parents.
[00:30:21] <greenbagels> tempate: I'm not so sure; I think there's a healthy balance of the two
[00:30:44] <greenbagels> And somiaj hits a solid point imo of education not existing in the vacuum of the classroom

[00:31:10] <millido> I have a dataset that can be represented as a matrix, with one axis as "sources" and the other as "category". Where each source has a number of items in each category. I am trying to say something sensible about which category a given source fits into. Any thoughts on this? I So far the two ideas I have is to find the percentage in each category per individual source. Or to sort in ascending order (each source) and do (1/x)/cummulative sum of
[00:31:10] <millido> source. Which really is two sides of the same coin I think
[00:31:20] <tempate> Cale: I call problem solving being faced with a problem you have no clue how to solve at first, not one where they've given you the method beforehand and now you just have to apply it
[00:31:30] <Cale> I think it would be fantastic to have early mathematics courses which were neither "calculator ownership" nor "how to be a calculator". If there's one thing the average person could take away from a bit of mathematics education, it's an ability to apply logical reasoning to deduce things.
[00:31:55] <Cale> Mathematics is just a very nice, clean setting in which to learn how to do that.
[00:32:18] <somiaj> For me at the calculus level, I would like to have students when they encounter something they don't quite know, just not freeze, but be able to a) try something, and b) decide if what they tried is reasonable.
[00:32:41] <Cale> But rather than do that, they generally strip out all the proofs, removing all the explanations of *why* the rules you're being given hold, making things hard to remember, and also failing to instil an ability to use logic.
[00:33:24] <jellydonut> the calculus classes i am trying to push myself through strike me more as hazing rituals than learning anything at all
[00:33:47] <somiaj> Cale: one theme that arises with the math educators here is getting away from this all paths lead to calculus. Thus they have things like 'precalculus' which are designed to just get the mechanics needed. Instead maybe more computer programing, discrete math, graph theory, type stuff would spark curisoity vs, 'here is some computation you may need when you hit calculus'

[00:39:20] <XCode> Cale: do you know algebraic geometry?
[00:39:30] <somiaj> it is why common core was such a flop, the teachers were not properly trained how to implement it and deal with parents. There was barely funding to create it.
[00:39:58] <tempate> I'm afraid I don't know what common core is
[00:40:05] <somiaj> tempate: it can, but funding and being able to address issues like this are very important (at least in the states).
[00:40:29] <tempate> somiaj: yeah, right
[00:40:46] <somiaj> common core referes to trying to change how basic math was taught (addition/subtraction/multiplication/division). Instead of teach algorithims, it taught them various ways to split numbers apart and put them back together.
[00:40:50] <Cale> XCode: Just a little bit
[00:40:58] <isekaijin> somiaj: Calculus is primarily motivated by physics. (And, even in other sciences, by physics envy to some extent.) So perhaps part of the reason why kids find calculus so boring (in addition to real analysis being such a drag, of course) is that they don't really go out that much anymore. Computers and smartphones are too addictive.
[00:41:10] <somiaj> there are other parts of it, but it was an attempt to address problems with that level of math in public schools.
[00:41:15] <XCode> Cale: do you know about this ?
[00:41:16] <XCode>  Let X = C_1 x C_2. We have the cycle class map z^1(X) --> H^2(X,Z) n H^{1,1}(X,C). If we use Kunneth we find expansion for H^2(X,Z). I want to know when is it true that H^{1,1}(X,Z) n {H^1(C_1,C) otimes H^1(C_2,C)} = 0.
[00:41:57] <Cale> Only insofar as it's some cohomology shenanigans. I don't even know what C_1 and C_2 refer to there.
[00:42:08] <tempate> somiaj: this is the first time I'm hearing about this, but I don't think it's the right way to go
[00:42:18] <somiaj> isekaijin: calculus courses are also filled with formulas and complications that are put there to test some skill that don't have any physical relation. In our calculus courses here, we try to only use formulas and skills directly related to understanding and solving physical problems. It has been fairly sucessful.
[00:43:12] <tempate> somiaj: how they add or substract numbers is meaningless to me. they can, and probably should, use a calculator. I would just like to see them thinking, try different things to solve a problem, test their ideas and see why they do or don't work

[00:44:34] * tempate looks at XCode and Cale and goes back to his algebraic geometry textbook
[00:44:56] <somiaj> this was just one part of common core, but the main point was to try to motivate and encourage thinking about numbers/math vs learn some algorithim a calculator can do better.
[00:45:35] <tempate> somiaj: I see, I'll look into it and give you a more educated opinion
[00:46:03] <somiaj> tempate: I don't agree with everything it does, but it was to me a step forward, and it was totally destroyed due to politics and parents when it was being implemented.

[08:31:33] <MsPooh> I knew a guy that claimed he invented Map function

[08:34:56] <z6np-6w> you can make julia a lot more dense than even perl if you put some effort into it lol

[09:33:21] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[09:34:05] <greenbagels> i guess my question is: when defining F, are they fixing a single n and W, and taking the sigma algebra generated by this singleton set?

[09:46:12] <PlanckWalk> rsonx: I wouldn't interpret it like that
[09:46:49] <trbp> is it vital to differ between a "new" orange and an "old" orange ball?
[09:46:55] <trbp> if not who cares?

[09:47:55] <rsonx> PlanckWalk: But the statement "If a green ball is drawn, it is not replaced" means that the selected green ball is put back in the box. i.e the word "replaced" means putting back in the box.

[09:57:51] <PlanckWalk> "Replaced" could mean *either* the same one is put back in. *or* another of the same colour is put in.

[09:58:18] <PlanckWalk> In the case of an orange ball the problem specifies the latter option for "is replaced".
[09:58:48] <rsonx> so could "Replaced with antoher orange ball" mean that the same is put back in the box along with another orange ball.

[10:09:18] <greenbagels> jbis: sure; just don't expect spoonfeeding :D
[10:11:30] <jbis> The question is basically a change-making problem. I have 5 and 6 "coins". I need to find the smallest p such that for all k >= p, change can be made with 5 and 6 coins. (n \in N)
[10:11:42] <jbis> 5 and 6 are values not amounts.
[10:11:53] <jbis> not quantities*
[10:12:17] <jbis> I don't really know where to start. Could someone provide a suggestion on how to start?
[10:12:41] <jbis> (k \in N)*
[10:13:39] <W> the word is denominations - and with such small numbers, a good start is just writing out what change amounts you can make with your denominations

[10:14:05] <W> e.g. 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16...
[10:14:54] <W> you'll often spot a pattern that way that leads you to a more general formulation
[10:17:21] <greenbagels> There's a divisibility phenomenon thing behind this problem isn't there
[10:17:27] <W> yes
[10:17:33] <jbis> they all take the form 5a + 6b (obviously)
[10:17:42] <W> or looked at another way, a binomial
[10:19:40] <greenbagels> jbis: is this for a number theory class?
[10:19:42] <W> you can also look at it as induction - if you can make change for the amount k, when can you make change for the amount k+1 or k-1?
[10:19:43] <pokhu> you can go from 10 to 11 by changing a 5 to a 6, similarly 11 to 12 by that, but not to 13 because there are no 5's left to change, but eventually youll reach a point where you never run out of 5's and you can safely change it to 6's until you go from 25 to 30, so p = 5 i think
[10:20:09] <W> yeah pokhu answered what I was hinting at
[10:20:18] <pokhu> but 24 also works so youll need to search for the lower number
[10:20:58] <jbis> What does "no 5's left" mean?
[10:21:01] <pokhu> W: sorry if i was spoonfeeding, i found the answer and i was excited because it was easier than i expected
[10:21:49] <pokhu> jbis: like 12 = 6 + 6, you cant change another 5 to a 6, but 17 = 5 + 6 + 6, so you still have another 5, so you also have 18 = 6 + 6 + 6
[10:22:04] <W> jbis, you can give 28 in change using 5+5+6+6+6, that's using two 5's
[10:22:32] <W> since there's a 5 you can change to 6, you can also give out 29 in change
[10:22:44] <W> (and it turns to 5+6+6+6+6)
[10:22:54] <jbis> is that not the same thing as saying 5a + 6b?
[10:23:08] <W> yes, it is, but it is closer to the insight you need
[10:23:39] <W> if you can give out 30 in change (6+6+6+6+6) can you give out 31 in change using this inductive pattern?
[10:24:23] <W> if you can give out 25 (5+5+5+5+5) can you give out 24?
[10:26:08] <jbis> Hmm. Now the question is how to formally prove that with induction.
[10:26:12] <W> for k=5a+6b, you can also have k-1=5(a+1)+6(b-1) and k+1=5(a-1)+6(b+1) right? but a and b can't be just any integer, so then you can reason about what values a and b must be when k-1 isn't possible

[11:16:27] <confuzeus> i think by looking at this problem for more than an hour, you have created a mental block to solving it. i think you need to move on to the next homework question. then you can come back later to it. as far as i can tell you are not making progress on your own. the fact that everyone can see the solution is also putting pressure on you.

[11:53:38] <W> jbis, well first it was 5a+6b, which is that I used, but in any case I should have said -1=5delta_a+6delta_b to make it clearer, we're talking about k=5a+6b, k-1=5(a+delta_a)+6(b+delta_b)
[11:54:51] <W> once you have some values for delta_a and delta_b you should see what non-negative a and b would have to be for a+delta_a and b+delta_b to still be non-negative

We can simplify this to -1=5c+6d,a>=-c,b>=-d by subtracting p,c, and d from each side correspondingly, and since you know there are infinite c and d such that -1=5c+6d, you need to look at the other two inequalities, which will reduce your c,d pairs to a quite finite list,

(the answer is 3/7) but how do I calculate this? I assume that I do f(x) = g(x) and then start to solve for x but I couldn't get that to work. I also failed with substitution here.

[15:49:12] <widp> Where do i start?
[15:49:52] <widp> I am a software engineer right now. I have an interest in mathematics.
[15:49:54] <ski> most people tend to learn at least some basics, in school. (even though schools, generally speaking, do a bad job about teaching mathematics)

[15:50:37] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[15:50:46] <widp> The amount of math I use in my job has slowly increased.
[15:51:58] <widp> I just started reading the princetons companion to math. But people say you have to solve problems.
[15:52:11] <widp> I am looking for a problem book now
[15:52:48] <ski> you should know basic arithmetic. then simple algebra, like solving simple equations, and reasoning about expressions with variables. understanding functions, and how they relate to graphs. learning something about linear algebra (with vectors and matrices) could be useful. perhaps (or perhaps not) limits, sequences, series, derivatives, integrals. some basic logic (especially reasoning principles), and some
[15:52:54] <ski> basic set theory
[15:53:03] <widp> My mathemarics mostly consists of some vague intuitions about some mathematical objects.
[15:54:13] <widp> I am familiar with most of what you mentioned
[15:54:40] <ski> perhaps you'll want to learn a little bit more about abstract algebra (semigroups,monoids,groups,rings,lattices,boolean algebras,..). perhaps you'll want to learn something about combinatorics (which is about counting stuff), and about graph theory. if you liked calculus, analysis (limits, .., integrals), you might want to learn about metric spaces, topology
[15:55:28] <ski> also there's number theory, about the properties of integers (more or less, also including "integer-like" things)
[15:55:36] <widp> I understand some of the concepts of each, but I am stumped when presented with a problem.
[15:55:41] <ski> for a more general and abstract view of algebra, and most other math fields, it can help to learn a little about category theory

[16:10:02] <isekaijin> ski: The trouble with natural deduction is that using it results in *very long* proofs.
[16:10:10] <ski> yes
[16:10:47] <ski> but you should be able to see how the mathematical prose in a vernacular proof would translate to the inference rules in a natural deduction formal proof
[16:11:29] <isekaijin> The more traditional approach based on just a single rule (modus ponens) plus a lot of axioms has the advantage that it has the so-called “deduction theorem”, which justifies taking certain shortcuts.
[16:11:35] <widp> Deductive and inductive logic, and/or, may /must, if, quantifiers, self reference
[16:11:54] <Franciman> maybe sequent calculus
[16:11:57] <Franciman> is the tool to use

[16:12:51] <isekaijin> AFAICT the only good thing about natural deduction is that, purely from an aesthetic perspective, the introduction and elimination rules for the distinct connectives “mirror each other”.
[16:12:52] <ski> Sequent Calculus certainly has a bit more elegance, symmetry

[16:17:22] <ski> isekaijin : yes. but without having seen it spelled out at least once, i think people have a harder time (at least without lots of practice reading and writing proofs, with feedback from others) seeing the connection
[16:19:23] <ski> widp : in ND, rather than reason about truth-values of statements, you're reasoning about "If ... holds, then ... follows.". connecting starting points (assumptions/hypotheses/premises) to conclusions. each logical connective have a few Introduction rules, and a few Elimination rules. (typically just one,two, or zero, for each of those two kinds, for each connective)
[16:20:34] <widp> What's nd?
[16:20:39] <isekaijin> Natural deduction.
[16:20:39] <ski> Natural Deduction
[16:20:47] <widp> I c
[16:21:20] <widp> Yes I get that, and inductive reasoning feels like extrapolating
[16:21:28] <ski> the introduction rules tells you how you can conclude/prove a logical formula with that connective as main / "top" connective, typically given already knowing/assuming formulae that are the direct subformulae of it. the elimination rules go in the opposite direction, they tell you how you can "take apart" a formula (depending on which its main connective is), how you can actually make *use* of the information

[19:02:20] <isekaijin> And I was like... Really, REALLY?
[19:03:22] <isekaijin> One thing I like about Serre's approach to constructing sheaves is that he doesn't need presheaves at all.
[19:03:49] <isekaijin> He defines sheaves as their own étale spaces.

[19:15:12] <cadmio> Let f(x) ∈ F[x] a polynomial of degree n ≥ 1. Then there exists an extension E of F of degree ≤ n! where f(x) has all the roots.
[19:15:35] <Pollion> cadmio: well, otherwise it is false. Consider the field Q for instance and the polynomial f(X) = X^2+X+1. Then there is no quadratic extension of Q in which f has all its roots.

[19:18:25] <Pollion> What would you want to put instead of n! ?
[19:19:02] <int-e> the pragmatic answer is "because that's what we'll manage to prove"

[19:19:42] <Pollion> But it's not the same property. In this lemma you just find ONE root in E. Not all of them.
[19:20:06] <Pollion> When you have your first root, there are still maybe n-1 to find.
[19:20:17] <int-e> So the proper question is "is there a better bound", to which the answer is basically, no; it frequently happens that the polynomial has only one root in any degree n extension.
[19:20:53] <int-e> (degree 2 polynomials are an exception)

[19:22:49] <sek> isekaijin: right well for characteristic classes I don't see why one would need the generality of presheaves. Maybe the lecturer wanted to setup presheaves as generally as possible first, but got a bit carried away...
[19:23:42] <sek> isekaijin: for me the only instance I care about presheaves is in the observation that the tensor product of two sheaves and that the image of a morphism of sheaves is a presheaf. Otherwise presheaves are just abstract things used more in logic or category theory
[19:23:46] <Pollion> f(X) = X^3 - 2 should do the trick. You can easily find a degree 6 (=3!) extension of Q in which f has all its roots, but you cannot find a degree 3 extension which has the same property.

[23:34:16] <somiaj> I see ways to do this in latex, but not seeing any default in mathjax for this
[23:34:28] <somiaj> you could look up the \ddots macro and write your own.

[23:39:57] <blackfield> to show there is a bijection between {f;f:C->A×B} and {(h1,h2);h1:C->A, h2:C->B}, what would i need to add to this drawing https://imgur.com/a/XJlGq1i , so that the diagram commutes? i assume pi_1 to be A×B->a such that (a,b)⟼a

[23:46:35] <Pollion> but here dunno :/
[23:46:50] <Pollion> maybe redifine your own command as somiaj said
