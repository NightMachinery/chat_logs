[02:35:06] <wasamasa> yeah, that works
[02:35:09] <wasamasa> but now I'm thinking about whether I want local time at all
[02:35:12] <wasamasa> probably utc
[02:42:33] *** Joins: ublx (~ublx@user/ublx)
[02:42:43] <jcowan> I'd say: convert to local time only at the edge of the program
[02:44:39] <wasamasa> the thing is that it's git giving me local times
[02:47:01] <jcowan> Ugh.
[02:50:04] <wasamasa> and the workaround is apparently to either obtain unix timestamps or set TZ
[03:00:00] <wasamasa> I ended up using unix timestamps
[03:21:04] <wasamasa> I just realized incrementing the date is as easy as converting to seconds, adding the amount, then converting back to a date
[03:21:15] <wasamasa> however, what if there's a leap second adjustment, hm
[03:32:51] <klovett_> (date-adjust (current-date (utc-timezone-locale)) +1 'day)

[14:16:51] <wasamasa> wow, I must say, this flymake-chicken.el thing I built is pretty nice
[14:17:01] <wasamasa> saves me some time in the edit-compile cycle
[14:17:11] <wasamasa> I just wish that all warnings had line numbers associated with them
