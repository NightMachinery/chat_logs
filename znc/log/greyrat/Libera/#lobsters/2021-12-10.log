[23:26:45] <gwozniak> Fun tech support of the day: customer does not understand volatile and insists compiler is wrong for not storing content back to memory when the value changes when variable is not marked volatile
[23:33:06] <indigo> Oh nooo
[23:33:47] <gwozniak> This is why customers rarely use anything other than -O1 or -O0
[23:34:00] <gwozniak> Or, they mark everything volatile
[23:34:01] <indigo> I'm assuming this variable references something like mmaped IO

[23:34:31] <indigo> Cool cool cool

[23:37:28] <gwozniak> One thing I have observed (and I don't think this is unique to us) is that those who complain about the compiler doing it wrong are only thinking in terms of their specific architecture or their problem.  So when the compiler generates something odd looking, it is immediately the fault of the compiler

[23:44:06] <ngoldbaum> small-batch artisinal 68k assembly
[23:46:21] <rb> *ahem* please excuse the wall of text, because i'm bored and don't really have anyone else to tell this
[23:46:27] <rb> in my object system, i have separated objects and object maps. an _object map_ describes the general _shape_ of the object (i think a similar idea exists in javascript now), it describes all the slots on the object as well as other additional properties. object maps are supposed to be immutable, so we can give the illusion of objects being fully copied when the user does `object copy` for
[23:46:29] <rb> example. this allows self objects to be very cheap to copy (because an object is just an object map pointer + values of all the assignable slots for that specific object, and most slots are not assignable). but a problem emerges when you need to add slots to an existing object (because that's useful when setting up the stdlib, for example). to add a slot to an existing object, you will have to
[23:46:31] <rb> modify the map of that object. but we already said that maps are immutable; so we need to copy the map. this is all fine and dandy, because the object we are adding slots to will just point to the new map and all the other objects will point to the old map, no harm done. but the bigger problem is when a new _assignable_ slot gets added; there you will _also_ need to make a copy of the target
[23:46:33] <rb> object the new slots are being added to, because the target object needs extra space for the assignable slot values. but that requires you to now go through the entire space, fixing up references to the old position of the object and forward them to the new position of the object. that is what `reallocObject` is supposed to do. i'm trying to figure out a way to do this while not duplicating my
