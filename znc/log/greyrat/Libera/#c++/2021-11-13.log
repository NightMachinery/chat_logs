[02:36:19] <CarloWood> Aka, b must exist during the whole life-time of x.
[02:36:20] <RandomReader> although another common pattern is to make it a pointer, to make it clear to the caller that it's expected to live
[02:36:35] <RandomReader> that guarantee isn't something you can make in general, at some point you'll need to trust the caller

[02:37:16] <CarloWood> Never do using namespace government;
[02:39:47] <CarloWood> Wait.. I use a factory... sigh.  The real is always different from test snippets isn't it.

[02:40:36] <CarloWood> Where do I post the 1 MB of real code?
[02:40:44] <bpalmer> well, you can make b owned by x
[02:41:09] <bpalmer> so x is responsible for destroying b during its destruction, although technically b will be destroyed just before x
[02:41:11] <CarloWood> b must be an automatic variable, certainly don't want it to be on the heap either.
[02:41:48] <CarloWood> The actual code that shouldn't compile is:
[02:41:51] <kalven> (for efficiency)
[02:41:51] <CarloWood>   auto command_buffer_w = command_buffer(command_pool_type::wat(command_pool));
[02:42:12] <CarloWood> where command_buffer is an object, and the () following it is a operator()(..).
[02:42:23] <CarloWood> I can't delete a member function can I?
[02:43:06] <RandomReader> "= delete" is a definition, and can be applied to any function
[02:43:17] <CarloWood> Oh, cool - I didn't know that.
[02:43:28] <RandomReader> "= default" is the one that only works for functions the compiler knows how to generate, so special members
[02:43:28] <CarloWood> I thought it was only for constructors and stuff
[02:44:13] <RandomReader> yeah I don't see it on arbitrary functions too often, but it's helpful for controlling overloads in some cases

[05:18:28] <kalven> sizeof doesn't work on dynamic arrays
[05:18:29] <abode> I'm not an expert in C++
[05:18:43] <abode> I left it along time aog
[05:18:44] <RandomReader> (R is a pointer to the first int element in the array, not the array itself .. therefore there's nothing to check the size against)
[05:18:50] <abode> but now I'm using it
[05:18:54] <kalven> that just tells you the relationship between the size of a pointer and the size of an int
[05:19:33] <abode> ok then , in a for loop how do I jump to the next R element in the array
[05:20:28] <abode> I'm trying to enter the values of it
[05:22:28] <RandomReader> the most common approach is to use a counter for the index:   for (int i = 0; i < numberOfResistors; ++i) { /* do things with R[i] */ }
[05:23:17] <abode> RandomReader, this is how I did it , didn't work
[05:23:30] <RandomReader> however this is more C-style; the more common approach in C++ is to use a std::vector instead of bare new[], and then you can use a range-for loop
[05:24:08] <abode> how can I do it
[05:24:12] <RandomReader> this is also the point where you really should learn C++ basics so that you have an easier time knowing where to look

[05:24:26] <RandomReader> stackoverflow has a recommended book list, but the other links may also help
[05:25:19] <RandomReader> are you choosing what each R value starts as in this code?
[05:25:32] <abode> very true , but I'm no programmer , I just want to write a small program to help me with my work

[05:26:45] <RandomReader> is there a particular reason you're using C++? there are certainly easier languages, particularly if your primary work is in a scientific field
[05:27:40] <RandomReader> anyway, std::vector is a container that models a dynamic array .. typical usage is to add things to it, and then you can perform operations over what it contains
[05:28:17] <RandomReader> so it might look like:  std::vector<int> R;   R.push_back(first_value);  R.push_back(second_value);   etc
[05:29:03] <abode> RandomReader, it's the only language I know , I learned it 8 years ago in university
[05:29:04] <RandomReader> afterward, R.size() contains the count of elements, and if you simply want to iterate over all the elements, range-for looks like:   for (auto&& e : R) { /* e is one of the elements, you can look at or assign to it as needed */ }
[05:30:34] <RandomReader> it's also indexable as R[i] as needed
[05:31:18] <RandomReader> if you don't have starting values for R but want it to start out containing some number of 0 elements, then:   std::vector<int> R(numberOfResistors);
[05:31:59] <RandomReader> that was ambiguous phrasing: some number of elements each with the value 0
[05:33:48] <RandomReader> as a container, R will clean up after itself when it goes out of scope, so you don't need to remember to use "delete" later .. and it behaves just like any other simple variable value, meaning you can pass a copy to a function etc as desired
