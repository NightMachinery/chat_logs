[00:01:04] <letoram> mouseghost : not a vr game as such, but google earth is damn cool in VR
[00:01:14] <mouseghost> same as watching things actually

[00:02:48] <ngoldbaum> drakonis: psvr2 will hopefully be pretty cool
[00:03:00] <drakonis> yeah
[00:03:06] <ngoldbaum> the ps5 should be capable of sustaining a decent framerate at a reasonable resolution
[00:03:16] <ngoldbaum> and inside out is so much nicer than lighthouses
[00:03:33] <ngoldbaum> you really need 3 or 4 otherwise you’ll have occlusion issues no matter what
[00:04:00] * ngoldbaum bought a valve index and regrets it
[00:04:40] <Xe> i like index tracking over the oculus personally
[00:06:38] <ngoldbaum> maybe i should get another lighthouse i only have two and it loses tracking way too often
[00:06:55] <ngoldbaum> plus it’s uncomfortable to wear for longer than 10 minutes or so
[00:06:58] <ngoldbaum> at least for me
[00:09:06] <Xe> ngoldbaum: does your VR room get outside sunlight?
[00:09:53] <ngoldbaum> yeah glints don’t help i’d always pull the blinds before playing
[00:10:00] <ngoldbaum> haven’t set it up in the new house yet
[00:10:08] <ngoldbaum> it would be in the basement
[00:10:34] <Xe> yeah, it's best in a cave
[00:11:00] <ngoldbaum> half life alyx is amazing
[00:11:06] <ngoldbaum> beat saber is amazing
[00:11:11] <ngoldbaum> everything else? eh…
[00:11:18] <ngoldbaum> at least from what i’ve played
[00:11:28] <ngoldbaum> a lot of gimicky “experiences” still
[00:12:38] <bkero> VR Accounting p gud
[00:12:43] <Xe> ngoldbaum: you tried Synth Riders yet?
[00:14:09] <ngoldbaum> nope
[00:14:39] <ngoldbaum> is the default song lost in synth riders better than beat saber?
[00:14:57] <ngoldbaum> the songs that come with beat saber are bad

[00:30:55] <ngoldbaum> at one point they were arguing that the case has to be dismissed because the law they’re being sued under, which extends the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse lawsuits, is unconstitutional
[00:31:23] <companion_cube> wait, do they actually have that precise a constitution?
[00:31:24] <ngoldbaum> so the queen was paying lawyers to invalidate a state law that lets adult abuse survivors sue their abusers

[19:03:15] <Xe> being not-straight on the internet is a chore
[19:03:43] <riv> yeah
[19:12:40] <imode> the top thread in the comments has to deal with distracting/burdening your coworkers. I'll counter with: why is there such a need to have constant-on video in meetings.
[19:14:08] <companion_cube> you should be allowed to turn off your video so you can take whiskey shots in peace.
[19:14:23] <imode> it's a gaudy use of bandwidth regardless. whether you're using an avatar or not. for something that adds literally nothing.
[19:14:32] <imode> it's a phone call. treat it like one.
[19:14:36] <riv> should i look at comments or not
[19:14:55] <imode> then you won't be "alarmed" at someone using a video stream for something other than showing their actual face.
[19:15:15] <imode> their arguments could be applied to fake backdrops in nearly every other situation.
[19:15:37] <imode> is it because the avatar in question looks like a JRPG character? shit that's a selling point in a lot of software.
[19:15:51] <imode> riv: it's mostly people railing against this as "professionalism".
[19:16:07] <imode> when in reality they're just weirded out by people doing vtuber stuff.
[19:16:23] <riv> vtube is cool af
[19:17:11] <gwozniak> Our team tends to prefer video on when we can
[19:17:27] <imode> it's "meh" in my opinion (I am not a fan of VR or similar things) but if "professionalism" and "distractions" are on the table we gotta talk about jim's aquarium background with realistic fish.

[19:19:57] <imode> neither do I, gwozniak, just that I'm not going to rally against it under the guise of professionalism when we shouldn't be mandating video feeds for people anyway.
[19:20:18] <gwozniak> Yes, I'm not going to rally against it either
[19:20:23] <Xe> video feeds aren't mandated at my workplace, but i am often the only one without one
[19:20:39] <gwozniak> As a team, we find video feeds help with communication so we use it when we can
[19:20:45] <imode> a mandate can be an unspoken rule.
[19:21:04] <gwozniak> But if someone has it turned off, that's not frowned upoin
[19:21:17] <imode> I never share video.
[19:24:46] <imode> my theory on remote working is that you and I should ideally should behave as if we are across the nearest ocean, that bandwidth is expensive and that we're both reasonable typists.
[19:25:21] <imode> everything apart from the most severe and corner cases can be done textually.

[19:52:17] <bradfier> A sensible default would be to disable all the video feeds when someone starts screen-sharing though, right?

[19:54:30] <companion_cube> I'd hate to be in a job where I had to use the phone
[19:54:57] <bradfier> I worked in a bank for a while and the expectation of "X has a desk phone and is near it" was surprisingly useful

[19:56:30] <ngoldbaum> i think having your camera running is fine, but if someone prefers to turn it off for whatever reason i detest when people insist that they turn on their camera
[19:56:48] <ngoldbaum> have some trust
[19:56:56] <ngoldbaum> who cares if you can see their face?
[19:57:11] <manicennui> I'd rather see people's faces once in a while.
[19:57:21] <manicennui> But I don't pressure anyone to do it.
[19:57:32] <manicennui> Most of my team has their cameras on most of the time.
[19:57:44] <Geekingfrog> It's quite hard to be the only one without camera though. Just the implicit peer pressure
[19:57:53] <imode> ^
[19:57:56] <manicennui> Eh.
[19:58:07] <manicennui> I turn mine off if I'm eating or if I'm mostly just there to listen.
[19:58:31] <ngoldbaum> people who have zoom running in collage mode are monsters anyway
[19:58:40] <Geekingfrog> what's collage mode ?
[19:58:48] <bradfier> I at least have inadvertantly set the expectation that "Oh bradfier uses linux so his webcam is probably broken this week"
[19:58:57] <Geekingfrog> :D
[19:59:10] <ngoldbaum> where all the cameras are displayed and no one has focus
[19:59:11] <imode> hah, same.
[19:59:25] <ngoldbaum> the zoom linux client is Bad
[19:59:45] <ngoldbaum> lately my mic only starts working once i go into the audio settings menu
[19:59:56] <bradfier> Does yours forget how to do SSO login on each first-boot? Literally every day I have to launch it, kill it, and relaunch it
[20:00:30] <ngoldbaum> not that zoom is necessarily responsible for audio on linux being a tire fire
[20:00:57] <bradfier> That sounds like pulseaudio being pulseaudio
[20:01:27] <bradfier> I switched over the pipewire with the pulse shim and it seems...fine? Although Zoom clearly doesn't subscribe to the 'new sink' events because if I turn my bluetooth headset on after I launch zoom I'm sunk.
[20:01:50] <imode> so glad I don't use Zoom.
[20:02:02] <bradfier> They're all bad I just wish my org would settle on one
[20:02:11] <bradfier> We have a mixture of Zoom, Google Meet and Teams
[20:02:47] <bradfier> Google Meet refuses to work properly in Firefox (like, won't use VAAPI half the time)
[20:02:54] <bradfier> But mysteriously if you spoof the user agent to be Chrome it works?
[20:03:32] <companion_cube> just blame it on google

[20:03:47] <companion_cube> I use chromium for a handful of things and that includes google meet
[20:04:08] <jlindgren> companion_cube: literally the only reason I have it installed.
[20:05:41] <imode> ngoldbaum: that motherfucker needs to see the movie and suffer like the rest of us.
[20:06:01] <companion_cube> to be fair it's not hard scifi
[20:06:17] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: zižek not this guy
[20:06:51] <jlindgren> imode: is it really that bad?
[20:07:01] <riv> has everyone seen the matrix4 ?
[20:07:03] <imode> jlindgren: if you doubt my words, watch it.
[20:07:06] <riv> can we discuss it yet
[20:07:07] <imode> it's horrible.
[20:07:11] <ngoldbaum> i feel like there’s the idea of a good movie inside matrix resurrections but it’s wrapped up in a package of irony and spite against warner bros
[20:07:11] <companion_cube> please do and live stream your reactions here
[20:07:33] <jlindgren> haven't seen it yet - but if its that bad....oof
[20:07:44] <jlindgren> so we're still on "the matrix was a great movie, too bad they never made any sequels"
[20:07:52] <imode> I'll never say "don't watch a movie". watch a movie.
[20:08:04] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[20:08:07] <ngoldbaum> there is a contingent that really likes resurrections fwiw
[20:08:30] <Xe> the 4th matrix movie is an argument for why it shouldn't have gotten any sequels
[20:08:35] <ngoldbaum> but if you liked the first movie because of the “guns lots of guns” scene you’re gonna have a bad tjme
[20:09:05] <imode> I think you can shorten it to "if you liked the first movie you're gonna have a bad time"
[20:09:22] <imode> I'm fully convinced anybody who really likes the movie has some kind of neurological damage.
[20:09:23] <jlindgren> personally i'm a fan of all the different martial arts they used in the first film https://v.redd.it/q35mn4jcpl881
[20:09:25] <buttsbot> The variety of martial arts techniques used in the first Matrix movie is absolutely breathtaking : Unexpected
[20:09:41] <imode> yeah you're gonna hate the fighting. I wouldn't even call it fighting.
[20:09:52] <ngoldbaum> lol the merovingian scene is so bad
[20:09:56] <ngoldbaum> on purpose
[20:10:09] <imode> how is it on purpose.
[20:10:30] <riv> the first film was great :)
[20:11:24] <Xe> it's also pretty devoid of metaphor on purpose
[20:12:13] <Xe> if you had created a metaphor to describe being transgender and in denial but then you find that militantly anti-transgender people are using that metaphor as a rallying call
[20:12:14] <Xe> you'd be pretty tempted to never use metaphors again either tbh
[20:13:58] <imode> is it actually established that that's a metaphor for being transgender or is that some J.K Rowling revisionism.
[20:14:31] <imode> because I think the point is that you can see what you want in the original film.
[20:14:33] <Xe> it's actually established by the transgender twins that wrote and directed the fucking thing
[20:14:52] <imode> my doubts are still there, considering it is a product of its time.
[20:14:54] <ngoldbaum> imode: it’s a parody of fight scenes
[20:15:07] <ngoldbaum> they made the fighting shitty on purpose
[20:15:11] <riv> what if neo was a girl
[20:15:21] <riv> when he woke up in the jelly thing
[20:15:27] <cb> and we kissed 😳
[20:15:33] <riv> 😳😳
[20:15:39] <riv> that's a sequel i want to see
[20:15:43] <imode> ngoldbaum: pretending you're an idiot doesn't make you less of an idiot.
[20:16:09] <imode> (not referring to -you-, but the general theme of "I did the thing on purpose therefore it doesn't suck")
[20:16:29] <Xe> riv: they wanted to do something like that but the studio said no
[20:16:43] <riv> oh that is interesting
[20:16:49] <riv> I didn't know
[20:16:52] <bradfier> I think as a product of its time the symbolism is less obvious than it would be if it was made today, which is a strength not a weakness
[20:16:54] <imode> that would've been infinitely more interesting.
[20:17:00] <riv> I am now assuming everyone has seen the matrix 4 or doesn't care about spoilers
[20:17:12] <bradfier> I mean is it so bad I shouldn't watch it?
[20:17:19] <riv> so I kind of felt like a lot fo the film was just making a mockery for their whole franchise
[20:17:20] <imode> watch it so you can verify our claims.
[20:17:30] <riv> and now I get why they did that

[20:18:12] <imode> riv: yeah it actively insulted you for being a fan, and the fourth wall breaks with warner brothers et. al. really just solidified that.. no.
[20:18:16] <manicennui> Remote elixir job.
[20:18:27] <imode> this isn't going to be a matrix movie, it's going to be a matrix parody.
[20:18:37] <imode> which if it was shooting for parody it did so with aplomb.
[20:18:38] <riv> it was so self referential to such a ridiculous extent
[20:18:59] <riv> it shouldn't have been called the matrix 4 it should have been called "This film is called the matrix 4"
[20:19:06] <imode> hahahahhahahahaha fuck.
[20:19:18] <imode> if they genuinely phrased it as a parody I would've been 100% on-board.
[20:20:37] <manicennui> Matrix 4: The Quest For More Money
[20:20:37] <imode> seriously, just lean into it in marketing and everything else. if it's a parody, lean into it being a parody. don't try to sell me a parody as a serious movie.
[20:20:49] <imode> The Matrix IRS Tapes
[20:22:25] <imode> on that same note, has anybody watched star trek: lower decks. is it as bad as I've heard it and imagined it to be.
[20:23:19] <riv> let me guess, it's a reality tv show set on the enterprise
[20:23:42] <imode> it's an animated spin-off parody series.
[20:24:09] <imode> I feel like all of TNG was a reality TV show set on the Enterprise.
[20:24:26] <manicennui> I think the studios have ruined a lot of franchises for me.
[20:24:37] <manicennui> I was the biggest SW fan ever in high school.
[20:24:45] <manicennui> And they have slowly made me hate it more and more.
[20:24:50] <manicennui> Now I just don't care about it, even the originals.
[20:25:08] <manicennui> The universe is a mess and lost its sense of wonder.
[20:25:28] <imode> mood.
[20:25:34] <manicennui> It's nothing but a cash grab now.
[20:25:50] <manicennui> And no, I don't have a problem with any female/non-white characters.
[20:26:09] <manicennui> The stories in the main series is just bad.
[20:26:14] <manicennui> s/is/are/
[20:26:19] <imode> "The universe is a mess and lost its sense of wonder." also applies to the general universe.
[20:26:28] <manicennui> Nah.
[20:26:33] <manicennui> There is tons of cool shit in real life.
[20:26:50] <Brekkjern> The last good story from the Star Wars universe was from the animated series of Clone Wars, and only after it had already gone on for a couple seasons

[20:28:33] <imode> holy shit.
[20:28:57] <ngoldbaum> imode: warner bros wanted the movie you want, lana made the movie she made to spite warner bros
[20:29:14] <riv> that's enough 'real life' for me for today
[20:29:18] <ngoldbaum> and warner bros adverised it as an action movie anyway
[20:29:22] <imode> manicennui: are we entirely sure that's not blood, it's got its beak clamped down pretty hard.
[20:29:35] <manicennui> imode: Yes.
[20:29:46] <imode> oh nevermind I can see the chick actually feeding.
[20:30:02] <manicennui> No idea why that one is leaking all over the head of the other.
[20:30:08] <imode> there's something overtly comedic about this shot.
[20:30:18] <imode> "you're trying, honey, and that's what's important"
[20:31:15] <manicennui> Almost all whale footage is pretty magical.
[20:31:44] <imode> ngoldbaum: I mean, good way to destroy a working relationship, I guess? is warner bros revisiting old IPs for new material such a bad thing? maybe it is.
[20:32:14] <ngoldbaum> she figured she might as well have some ownership i guess
[20:32:20] <ngoldbaum> she has enough money not to care
[20:32:25] <imode> so why do it, then.
[20:32:51] <imode> if you have the option of "produce matrix movie" or "do not produce matrix movie", why choose option 1.
[20:33:05] <imode> it's not homework, there was no obligation (unless I'm missing something).
[20:33:35] <riv> i dont think we're going to get a satisfactory answer to that
[20:38:38] <manicennui> imode: Because they were going to make it regardless.
[20:38:48] <manicennui> So she was able to get paid and give them the finger.
[20:38:51] <edk> wanting a matrix 4 is pretty questionable imo
[20:38:57] <imode> meh.
[20:39:10] <edk> unplanned sequels are artless capitalist piss
[20:39:38] <edk> (not to be construed as implying the possibility of artful capitalist piss)
[20:39:43] <manicennui> edk: Not much you can do once you agree to studio money.
[20:40:05] <edk> so don't
[20:40:08] <imode> yeah. I asked roughly the same thing when the SW sequel trailers dropped.
[20:40:21] <edk> i do respect lana for sticking it to the man
[20:40:43] <manicennui> edk: Most people don't have the money to make movies on their own.
[20:41:44] <manicennui> Especially a movie like The Matrix.
[20:41:50] <imode> how is making a film like this sticking it to the man. why not just say "no, I'm not doing this, I denounce this whole movie."
[20:42:00] <imode> and be very public and vocal about it.
[20:42:10] <manicennui> The original movie had a budget of $63 million.
[20:42:34] <manicennui> imode: Because they could have done almost anything and had it do better in theaters?
[20:42:53] <manicennui> Everyone knows that it is crap.
[20:43:02] <manicennui> And they spent a fuckton on it.
[20:43:05] <imode> not everyone, as evidenced by the discussions earlier.
[20:45:51] <riv> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkNIs2XWZU i watched this interview with one of the directors
[20:45:52] <buttsbot> Lana Wachowski Describes What It’s Like Returning to the Matrix - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkNIs2XWZU
[20:46:02] <manicennui> She is the only director.
[20:46:21] <companion_cube> the bigger issue is that it doesn't seem to pay for itself, does it?
[20:46:31] <manicennui> Lilly wasn't involved.
[20:46:36] <manicennui> companion_cube: Not so far.
[20:46:42] <manicennui> companion_cube: Hard to say with HBO Max.
[20:47:00] <manicennui> It's currently about $65 million short.
[20:47:18] <manicennui> Kind of doubt that it made HBO enough in subscriptions to make up for that.
[20:47:29] <imode> I definitely cancelled mine after watching.
[20:47:41] <manicennui> But the studios generally aren't looking for movies with budgets that large to break even.
[20:48:25] <manicennui> And they'd be nuts to try to make another sequel now.
[20:48:32] <companion_cube> matrix 4.5
[20:48:51] <manicennui> I bet they could have done something good enough for modern audiences to make some money and justify a sequel without Lana.
[20:49:06] <manicennui> I mean, there are people who like the SW sequels.
[20:49:06] <edk> manicennui: i don't disagree, but i don't think it contradicts what i said. when you make a deal with capitalism to make you art, you run the risk that capitalism will turn it into artless piss
[20:49:26] <manicennui> edk: I'm not disagreeing.
[20:49:38] <manicennui> Our entire society is controlled by those with capital.
[20:49:43] <companion_cube> I don't dislike the SW sequels
[20:49:51] <companion_cube> they kind of sucked less than some of the prequels
[20:49:53] <manicennui> And everything requires a lot of capital to make.
[20:49:57] <manicennui> companion_cube: You sick fuck.
[20:50:02] <companion_cube> I know!
[20:50:07] <manicennui> companion_cube: I think they were just bad in different ways.
[20:50:09] <imode> companion_cube: you are an absolute freak.
[20:50:11] <companion_cube> I should rewatch them, though.
[20:50:18] <edk> i don't think they sucked less than the prequels
[20:50:22] <companion_cube> to make a more informed judgement
[20:50:26] <manicennui> Although both the prequels and sequels suffer from CGI eye vomit.
[20:50:31] <companion_cube> edk: there's no jar jar, that has to count for something
[20:50:31] <edk> the prequels were just... bad. poorly conceived and poorly executed
[20:50:42] <edk> but george was at least doing his inadequate best
[20:50:50] <imode> episode II is coming up on its 20th.
[20:50:54] <Brekkjern> I'm glad that Netflix doesn't judge you for watching the same thing over and over again... It probably should, but it's nice that it doesn't :P
[20:51:05] <companion_cube> it probably does but doesn't tell you
[20:51:11] <Brekkjern> True that
[20:51:20] <edk> the sequels otoh were absolutely devoid of any kind of creativity or original thought
[20:51:27] <manicennui> Netflix just wants you to remain subscribed.
[20:51:46] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:52:02] <manicennui> Speaking of which, I just finished Kipo and really loved it.
[20:52:08] <manicennui> Wholesome as fuck.
[20:52:53] <manicennui> It's entertaining, creative, and amusing.
[20:52:59] <manicennui> Not laugh out loud funny, but amusing.
[20:53:25] <companion_cube> edk: oh for sure
[20:57:19] <manicennui> I haven't been keeping up with The Wheel of Time nor The Expanse.
[20:57:24] <manicennui> I also don't see people talking about either.
[20:57:58] <riv> i tried ep1 of wheel of time recently, but I didn't continue with it
[20:58:33] <companion_cube> now I'm worried that I'll also be judged for other things I watch :p
[20:59:59] <imode> watch what you wanna watch.
[21:02:39] <riv> portal reloaded on gdq :)
[21:04:22] <Brekkjern> WoT was mediocre
[21:04:36] <Brekkjern> Expanse is tending towards mediocre too imo
[21:06:10] <manicennui> riv: I watched a couple of episodes and they were not bad.
[21:06:13] <manicennui> Not enough to hook me though.
[21:06:29] <manicennui> Brekkjern: It is the final season of The Expanse and I think it is only 6 episodes.
[21:08:10] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I haven't watched the 6th one yet, but I haven't really found the rest of the season to be all that great
[21:08:53] <Brekkjern> Still way too many loose ends to tie this up neatly, and the acting has been mid so far
[21:09:24] <manicennui> Looks like the final episode is 15 minutes longer. Plenty of time!
[21:09:26] <Brekkjern> And the entire Laconia arc has only just been hinted at through the eyes of some kids there
[21:09:32] <Brekkjern> Lol
[21:10:47] <manicennui> I guess I could binge the final season this weekend.
[21:11:21] <manicennui> Looks like I have watched 3 of 8 episodes for WoT.
[21:11:49] <Brekkjern> It was surprising to see Shooreh in Arcane
[21:11:54] <Brekkjern> Or rather, her voice
[21:12:39] <Brekkjern> She's pretty much the best part of Expanse
[21:14:59] <manicennui> Ever see House of Sand and Fog?
[21:15:04] <manicennui> That was the first thing I saw her in.
[21:15:08] <manicennui> Really great and fucked up movie.
[21:15:27] <manicennui> Ben Kingsley is in it too.
[21:15:33] <Brekkjern> Nope. I assume I should add it to my list?
[21:15:56] <manicennui> It has been a long time since I saw it, but I remember it being quite good, and very fucked up.

[21:23:35] <imode> holy shit that movie sounds depressing. read the plot summary.

[21:32:51] <bradfier> manicennui: I haven't watched the latest Ep yet so no spoilers, but is that from the Episode or from some fun XRay with Wes and Shooreh?
[21:33:01] <manicennui> No idea.

[22:28:10] <gerikson> altho tbf there was a ton of spin-off books and vidyagames that were kinda crap
[22:28:36] <gerikson> also I give props to Jupiter Rising for being sui generis and not just some comic book IP
[22:29:32] <gerikson> I never got why people are so mad Linus is trying to be a better person https://lobste.rs/s/pydtol/dev_corrupts_npm_libs_colors_faker#c_ltnr34
[22:29:33] <buttsbot> Dev corrupts NPM libs 'colors' and 'faker' breaking thousands of apps | Lobsters
[22:51:07] <manicennui> gerikson: You mean Jupiter Ascending?
[22:51:13] <manicennui> It's too bad that it wasn't very good.
[22:51:41] <imode> gerikson: oh boy! is this more shit-flinging?
[22:53:19] <gerikson> manicennui: yeah :D
[22:53:25] <gerikson> it wasn't a total turkey
[22:54:18] <manicennui> There were great franchises in the 80s and 90s based on original IP.
[22:54:26] <manicennui> Terminator and Alien being the best examples.
[22:56:52] <imode> I don't get people who totally idolize Linus or totally villify him.
[22:57:16] <imode> people want something to attack or worship, I guess.
[22:59:59] <manicennui> If we don't attack or worship people and technologies, what is the point of HN/lobsters?!
[23:00:20] <manicennui> I almost wrote whorship, which also seems appropriate.
[23:00:29] <riv> people get *weird* about famous/successful people
[23:00:51] <manicennui> Rick Hickey does have really beautiful hair though.
[23:01:37] <manicennui> Most beautiful hair for a programming language creator?
[23:08:55] <manicennui> My coworkers are really bad about allowing things to become a priority just because someone asks about them.
[23:10:09] <manicennui> I don't need another meeting 3 days from now just because someone wants to talk about something we won't even get to this year.
[23:10:32] <companion_cube> gerikson: people are mad because linus was an excuse for having the same shitty behavior
[23:11:39] * manicennui doesn't need an excuse
[23:13:45] <imode> I've had shitty behavior since 1995!
[23:13:56] <manicennui> Whippersnapper!
[23:14:01] <companion_cube> this thread is good popcorn, damnit
[23:14:23] <companion_cube> someone says ddevault isn't trustworthy cause unstable… and banned from lobsters ✔
[23:18:09] <imode> I understand Drew is uh, interesting, and I'm probably somewhere in his general vicinity in terms of behavior.. but what'd he get bannenated for.
[23:18:33] <imode> like was there a straw.break(camel.back) situation
[23:21:06] <gerikson> gonna have to ask pushcx for hte exact reason
[23:21:12] <gerikson> theres's sometinhg in the modlog
[23:21:39] <imode> fun.
[23:21:44] <Brekkjern> Cause he got tired of his tepid takes that just created flamewars in the comment section
[23:21:57] <epilys> do you open issues just to shit on the maintainer for something?
[23:22:05] <imode> no.
[23:22:07] <epilys> that's the kind of thing he does
[23:22:12] <imode> who the fuck does that.
[23:22:16] <Brekkjern> Drew
[23:22:18] <edk> yes but he doesn't do that on lobste.rs
[23:22:20] <imode> do we have a sample.
[23:22:37] <edk> i personally think banning him was a bit excessive
[23:22:54] <Brekkjern> He yelled at a gemini client developer because their client accessed /favicon.txt on his server
[23:22:59] <Brekkjern> On their github
[23:23:04] <epilys> yeah, that
[23:23:08] <gerikson> https://lobste.rs/u/ddevault
[23:23:09] <buttsbot> User ddevault | Lobsters
[23:23:14] <epilys> it was ??? what ???
[23:23:29] <imode> Brekkjern: oh nice, why the hell did he have a problem with that.
[23:23:35] <companion_cube> :D was that the straw? amazing
[23:23:50] <gerikson> he has OPINIONS about gemini
[23:23:52] <companion_cube> imode: it's the slippery slope towards javascript and ads!
[23:23:58] <Brekkjern> That^
[23:24:17] <imode> oh good lord.
[23:24:45] <Brekkjern> That is why I implemented that functionality into buttsbot
[23:24:58] <companion_cube> buttsbot can lick favicons now
[23:25:02] <Brekkjern> Just to potentially piss him off if anyone posted a gemini link in here
[23:25:35] <epilys> you people don't understand, it's not on the spec?????
[23:25:54] <epilys> better waste your time on github.
[23:26:03] <riv> i also have opinions about gemini
[23:26:19] <edk> gemini is a fine pointless hobby for people to have i guess
[23:26:19] <Brekkjern> I only implemented Gemini support for shiggles
[23:26:30] <edk> i don't think drew is even really wrong to complain about them on github
[23:26:36] <imode> aren't hobbies already pointless.
[23:26:44] <edk> not all of them
[23:26:53] <Brekkjern> edk: What do you mean?
[23:27:08] <edk> well, what did people sign up for when they became gemini developers?
[23:27:37] <Brekkjern> Getting harassed by Drew aparrently
[23:27:59] <imode> I care just enough to complain if I can't use something.
[23:28:38] <edk> if you join a community whose unifying belief is that features are bad and that destroying the web would make it better, i don't think you can be very surprised when someone gets cross with you for trying to add a feature
[23:28:57] <ngoldbaum> but only some features are bad
[23:29:04] <ngoldbaum> otherwise they’d all be using gopher
[23:29:30] <edk> right
[23:29:30] <imode> they don't use gopher because it's NIH shit.
[23:29:36] <ngoldbaum> can’t have the NSA reading your favicon traffic
[23:29:41] <companion_cube> edk: waiting for the suckless x gemini hellscape
[23:29:43] <manicennui> Rails really does make it a pain to separate data, logic, and persistence.
[23:29:57] <companion_cube> no feature on either side!
[23:29:58] <edk> ngoldbaum: this also disposes their community to have lots of arguments about exactly which set of features are unbad, i guess
[23:30:05] <edk> companion_cube: that sounds ideal
[23:30:18] <riv> wait
[23:30:22] <riv> favicon.*txt* ?
[23:30:23] <edk> use a computer that can't do anything to access an internet with nothing on it
[23:30:24] <imode> suckless x gemini.. *shudder*
[23:30:28] <edk> perfection
[23:30:36] <ngoldbaum> iirc gerikson has a whole rant about how gemini is bullshit for exactly that reason
[23:30:51] <ngoldbaum> the arbitrariness of where to draw that line
[23:30:58] <companion_cube> hey now
[23:31:02] <companion_cube> no lines, only paragraphs
[23:31:13] <ngoldbaum> where to draw that div
[23:31:16] <ngoldbaum> and how to center it
[23:31:29] <manicennui> The examples that people have of the repository pattern in Rails are really bad.
[23:31:47] <riv> one of the main suckless guys that is obsessesd with chariman moa is the author of geomyidae, the #1 gopher daemon
[23:31:48] <manicennui> They just pull a few methods out of the model and put them in a new class called FooRepository.
[23:31:59] <manicennui> But Foo still inherits from ActiveRecord.

[23:38:42] <gerikson> tbh I'm looking thru Drew's comments and none of them warrant banning imho

[23:41:29] <imode> "Do not. Extend. Gemini." what're you gonna do you fucking raging internet nerd.
[23:41:40] <companion_cube> gerikson: it's the aggregate, I think
[23:41:46] <imode> ban him anyway lmao.
[23:41:51] <companion_cube> if he comments on sth, probability it becomes a flamewar triples
[23:42:22] <imode> "It's the only form of regulation we've got, and I'm prepared to use it to preserve Gemini for what it is, and not for what web users think it should be. Get used to it."
[23:42:40] <imode> wank harder, drew, you aren't a dictator.
[23:42:42] <companion_cube> gee I wonder why the original gemini creator left
[23:42:46] <ngoldbaum> the way drew treated alex gaynor in the python cryptography repo was extremely shitty
[23:43:08] <ngoldbaum> i haven’t seen him act out like that recently
[23:43:14] <imode> do tell.
[23:43:32] <companion_cube> pyca had moved some parts to rust

[23:46:55] <riv> what age is drew devault?
[23:47:03] <Brekkjern> Mentally or physically?
[23:47:10] <riv> like, number of years since birth
[23:47:26] <companion_cube> he's like 29 or 30 I think
[23:47:33] <riv> okay.....
[23:47:37] <imode> "mentally or physically" lmao Brekkjern.
[23:47:37] <riv> that is not the answer i expected
[23:48:05] <riv> i will go with leave him banned. if he was a lot younger I can understand this as part of growing up
[23:48:51] <ngoldbaum> imode: in practice right now it means adding support for llvm on a new architecture

[23:52:13] <imode> seriously, why not. fuck him and his shit.
[23:52:30] <Brekkjern> I was kinda planning to make a crawler that would connect to his gemini site and pull the favicon on every request through various proxies
[23:52:37] <imode> do it.
[23:52:50] <Brekkjern> But it's too much effort for trolling IMO
