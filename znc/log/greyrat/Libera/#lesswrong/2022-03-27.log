[00:00:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It works! Pull
[00:00:46] <gwern> ok
[00:00:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And so you may consider http://www.quivira-font.com/files/Quivira.pdf to be a viable source of icons to use
[00:00:53] <Robomot> PDF (39 pages; 1.6 MB) - Quivira CodeCharts (Alexander Lange) - Quivira CodeCharts
[00:01:29] <gwern> so what is the subset a subset of?
[00:01:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> What do you mean?
[00:02:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which code points are in the subset? Or what
[00:02:16] <gwern> yah
[00:02:33] <gwern> it very specifically says 'Quivira-SUBSETTED.otf', so it's not the whole Quivira. what *is* it and how was it decided etc
[00:02:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Currently only 26E8 (black cross), I was just testing to see if it works
[00:02:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> What should be added to it? Dunno, you tell me
[00:03:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe any unusual Unicode thingies currently in use?
[00:03:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe more that you want to use?
[00:03:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sky's the limit, just let me know which to put in there and I'll update it
[00:04:05] <gwern> ah. well, we need interrobang, android doesn't have it
[00:04:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interrobang, eh
[00:04:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I take it you want to use this for more than just linkicons, then
[00:04:55] <gwern> I thought this was to cover all the unicode edgecases, which includes some of our linkicons
[00:05:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[00:05:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll make the requisite changes to do that optimally
[00:05:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, put together a list, at least provisionally
[00:05:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I don't have to subset a dozen times
[00:07:40] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: we also need 'ùò≠', '‚ÅÇ', '‚îÅ', '‚Åª'
[00:07:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The reason it requires different treatment is that for linkicons, Quivira should be the first font - to let us use it to ensure consistency of linkicons across platforms, even when a glyph *is* available - while for body text it ought to be last, i.e. to be a fallback)
[00:08:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: lol. You're gonna have to name those for me >_>
[00:08:51] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF ITALIC SMALL L, ASTERISM, BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY HORIZONTAL, SUPERSCRIPT MINUS
[00:10:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> What in the world
[00:10:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok
[00:10:28] <gwern> they're in the unicode list and they are boxes on my smartphone, so while we're at it
[00:10:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> k.
[00:13:28] <gwern> MULTIPLICATION SIGN '√ó' is mentioned in my notes for future subsetting but I'm unsure if that is because the default is bad and we want one from ssp/ssfp? or if we need fallback
[00:16:28] <dbohdan[phone]> gwern: I can see 'ùò≠', '‚ÅÇ', '‚îÅ', '‚Åª' in IRCCloud on Android 10
[00:17:28] <kuudes> hexchat on ubuntu also shows them
[00:18:06] <gwern> I can't see them on my phone, so that is enough to demonstrate the need
[00:18:24] <gwern> I can see them all on my desktop, but that doesn't matter
[00:19:42] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: do css font specs not allow you to subset character ranges? 
[00:19:57] <adiabatic> rmmh: they do but I'm not sure if they work
[00:20:38] <gwern> rmmh: you subset the font file itself to not pay the bandwidth cost
[00:20:53] <adiabatic> ^
[00:21:21] <gwern> a full unicode fallback font might be like 20MB or something crazy. you can sepcify 'range: just use this for character F, X, and Z, thnx' but it still will download 20MB. it'll just throw away the other 19.999MB
[00:21:35] <rmmh> Oh I see
[00:21:45] <gwern> there's no bit-range

[00:22:00] <Robomot> unicode-range | CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks (The unicode-range property in CSS is used by the @font-face to define the characters that are supported by the font face.)
[00:22:21] <gwern> HTTP does have a range request for requesting ranges of bytes, there's just no connection between that and 'unicode-range'
[00:22:44] <rmmh> given how woff etc are structured there isn't one anyways 
[00:23:11] <gwern> yeah, without like an index up front, you'd have to manually extract the byte ranges. tooling could do it for you, but...
[00:23:46] <rmmh> 50 image resizing cdns, 0 font subsetting cdns. Sad! 
[00:24:01] <gwern> google fonts will subset dynamically to achieve a similar thing, iirc

[00:26:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, Google and Typepad both do dynamic subsetting
[00:26:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> But neither of that is done in CSS directly, of course

[00:38:33] <dbohdan[phone]> Images like this convince me of gwern's thesis that artists will have to switch to parasocial relationships with the audience as their value proposition
[00:38:52] <gwern> right?!
[00:39:37] <gwern> why would I even *want* to use an expensive, finicky, slow, unreliable human artist if I can just type in a prompt and get 64 diverse human-level images to pick from and tune my prompt a little
[00:40:13] <gwern> "let's see, I could spend 5 seconds typing a prompt, or I could spend $50 * 64 = $3,200 on fiverr for 64 commissions"
[00:40:14] <dbohdan[phone]> Yes. "Unlimited revisions", but for real.

[00:41:11] <dbohdan[phone]> What do you think will be the last genre of 2D art to go? I think crisp vector line art.
[00:42:03] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[00:42:10] <gwern> yeah, sharp vector art is pretty hard. glide et al are doing much better on that, but I'm not sure it's going to hit human-level even when the rest does. texture-heavy stuff like Impressionism will be the first to fall, but vector or pixel art?
[00:45:13] <gwern> it's possible you'll need separate models specialized to turn the rasters (or before that, the embeddings) into explicit vector art like generating SVG
[00:45:14] <synthmeat> or bezier animations
[00:45:34] <gwern> that works semi-well already. no one's worke on fusions afaik
[00:45:59] <synthmeat> [CITATION NEEDED!]
[00:49:34] <dbohdan[phone]> Vectorization worked okay on some kinds of art even in the late '00s with programs like VectorMagic. I am not sure what algorithms they used.
[00:50:14] <synthmeat> vectorization, yes. but not vector generation.
[00:50:37] <dbohdan[phone]> I haven't seen any Colab for generating or Twitter account posting vector art. So it seems behind pixel art.
[00:50:55] <synthmeat> why isn't pixel art solved? at least for small sprites?
[00:50:56] <dbohdan[phone]> synthmeat: Right
[00:51:00] <synthmeat> missing tags?
[00:51:19] <synthmeat> like, 32x32
[00:52:09] <synthmeat> "red wizard with a sword, casting fire spell"
[00:52:22] <gwern> synthmeat: the clip pixel art is decent enough but it still tends towards tessellation and too much detail and noise
[00:52:49] <gwern> it still is clearly inhuman
[00:53:08] <synthmeat> well, nft that shit when it's done :D

[00:56:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're definitely on the cake-y side of cookies, of course, but that's as it should be, they're not meant to be crisp
[00:57:07] <adiabatic> that reminds me, it's supposed to be cold on Monday. Good cookie-baking weather.

[01:31:26] <gwern> those are better, but it still doesn't seem like a viable strategy. laying on *lots* of lines isn't going to give you human-level vector art
[01:31:42] <gwern> the more lines you add, the more it's just an exorbitantly inefficient raster art
[01:31:54] <RiversHaveWings> yeah
[01:32:10] <RiversHaveWings> you have to eventually do stuff like sample the curve parameters from a transformer
[01:32:11] <RiversHaveWings> i think

[01:33:10] <dbohdan[phone]> RiversHaveWings: Not too bad. But I agree with gwern: this is closer to simulated brush strokes than line art.

[01:43:18] <quanticle> gwern: re: Russian generals, it's not actually all that difficult. Rob Lee has a list of Russian generals killed that he's created by looking at Russian state sources.
[01:43:29] <gwern> is that list the same as the WP list?
[01:43:47] <quanticle> I don't know, because that's all on his Twitter, and I haven't cross-correlated them
[01:43:59] <quanticle> But it is possible to reliably source at least some of them

[01:45:48] <gwern> you can hide'em for a few months. they'll even come out smelling nice if you get them to a fridge in time
[01:45:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I meant _Dark Dungeons_, not ... whatever the heck that is
[01:46:17] <gwern> oh, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Dungeons_(film)
[01:46:18] <Robomot> Dark Dungeons (film) - Wikipedia (Dark Dungeons is a 2014 American short film that was directed by L. Gabriel Gonda, written by JR Ralls, and based on the Chick tract of the same name.[1] The film had its world premiere at GenCon on August 14, 2014 and was also released on VOD through the film's official website.[2][3])
[01:46:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> yep
[01:46:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Watched that when it premiered at GenCon. The panel with the production team was amazing
[01:46:57] <gwern> the steam tunnels!
[01:48:40] * gwern squints. where's the lesbianism in the plot? it specifically promised lesbianism
[01:49:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's all subtext
[01:49:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's SO HEAVY
[01:49:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's the thing
[01:50:07] <gwern> well, is there heavy petting
[01:50:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> The screenwriter (who, by the way, is himself a priest! he talked about how they used to play D&D in seminary and all their parties were always 100% priests/paladins, lol) got permission to make this on the specific condition that it NOT be a parody
[01:51:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> So that's how they filmed it. It's played totally straight. Except with EXTREMELY INTENSE SUBTEXT ALL THE TIME. But no one ever, ever outright says anything that makes it definitely a parody.
[01:52:01] <dbohdan[phone]> "all their parties were always 100% priests/paladins" Haha
[01:52:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> At the panel they absolutely steadfastly refused to admit that it was anything but 100% serious while HINTING REAL HARD
[01:53:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> So e.g. Marcie is played as *super, super obviously* having a huge crush on Debbie and making increasingly desperate (but totally deniable!) hints as the movie progresses
[01:53:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> But of course Debbie is completely oblivious and notices nothing
[01:54:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the whole thing is like that
[01:54:17] <gwern> damn, if only debbie had noticed, they would've raised Cthulhu instantly
[01:54:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed. But innocence prevailed and the day was saved

[02:00:18] <adiabatic> gotta try some silly things
[02:01:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Microsoft mice have been surprisingly good
[02:02:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Better than Apple mice, that's for damn sure
[02:02:26] <gwern> you didn't find them magical?
[02:02:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I did not -_-
[02:02:56] <gwern> what about easy to understand? just one button!
[02:02:58] <adiabatic> I don't think I've even _tried_ an Apple mouse in decades
[02:03:14] <dTal> my favorite mouse every is a Microsoft Intellimouse Trackball
[02:03:24] <spxtr> those one-button puck mouses were a nightmare
[02:03:29] <quanticle> Whoa, wait, Microsoft made a trackball?
[02:03:31] <adiabatic> dTal: I wanted to like them but their balls are very sticky

[02:04:15] <quanticle> Index finger?
[02:04:26] <dTal> no it was better than logitech trackman, you used your fingers to move the ball instead of your thumb, and thumb to push both buttons
[02:04:27] <adiabatic> quanticle: yeah
[02:04:30] <dTal> ring finger for the wheel
[02:04:49] <dTal> I've never found another trackball with this configuration
[02:05:18] <quanticle> Yeah, that's what threw me off. I was expecting something like a Kensington trackball
[02:05:21] <dTal> adiabatic: yeah you did have to clean your balls thoroughly but that's part of the joy of ownership
[02:05:34] <quanticle> I mean, that's true of trackballs today too.
[02:05:39] <adiabatic> no, like, cleaning them wouldn't make them as smooth as a logitech trackball

[02:07:18] <adiabatic> white ambidextrous intellimouse optical USB, here
[02:08:10] <quanticle> I don't think I can go back to a corded mouse
[02:08:42] <quanticle> I didn't realize how much the tiny amount of friction between the cord and the edge of my mousepad bothered me until I got a wireless mouse and it was gone.
[02:09:02] <quanticle> And now I'm like, "Nope, I can settle for wired everything else, but the mouse has to be wireless."
[02:09:27] <quanticle> It helps that I'm not a huge gamer, so I don't need very high DPI or ultra-low latency.
[02:11:29] <dbohdan[phone]> For the past N years I have mostly used mousekeys and the numpad instead of a mouse
[02:12:02] <adiabatic> why
[02:12:08] <quanticle> What operating system do you use, if I might ask?
[02:12:09] <adiabatic> that always seemed so slow
[02:12:20] <spxtr> I like my logitech g pro wireless
[02:12:23] <spxtr> nice mousey
[02:12:59] <quanticle> adiabatic: Well, if you have the right window manager, and you use keyboard shortcuts for 95-99% of things, I can see how mousekeys would be a workable solution.
[02:13:04] <dbohdan[phone]> I use Linux. It seems easy on my wrists, strangely enough.
[02:13:20] <quanticle> It is probably easier on your wrists.
[02:13:44] <quanticle> It's just that, unless you're using keyboard shortcuts for a lot of things, it's too painfully slow for most people's use cases.
[02:15:20] <adiabatic> also remembering, say, what the last window was open
[02:17:15] <dbohdan[phone]> I used this setup with MATE for a long time, then switched to IceWM. It was a bit slow with MATE.
[02:20:07] <quanticle> I'm just a smoothbrained Gnome3 user
[02:20:08] <quanticle> Don't mind me

[02:21:32] <quanticle> Sometimes I think I should have installed Fedora instead of Ubuntu because I've gone through and disabled pretty much all of the Gnome 3 customizations that Ubuntu ships.
[02:23:06] <dbohdan[phone]> I may switch to something more conventional, like Cinnamon (based on Gnome) or KDE. The parts I put together for my desktop keep not fitting together well or breaking (I am looking at you, udiskie). 
[02:23:20] <quanticle> adiabatic: I don't get it. That seems pretty similar to the Logitech trackball. How is it worse?
[02:23:32] <adiabatic> higher-friction balls.
[02:23:38] <adiabatic> Otherwise, it's great.
[02:23:39] <quanticle> Huh
[02:24:46] <quanticle> I don't think I'm mature enough for this conversation. I tried to type, "Have you considered polishing your ball," three times and just could not without giggling.
[02:25:19] <adiabatic> who's saying none of the rest of us are also giggling?
[02:25:42] <quanticle> dbohdan[phone]: It's not your fault that dbus is fucking cancer

[02:50:59] <quanticle> Introspecting is overrated. It gives you the illusion of progress. Even in the best case, introspection needs to be followed up with action, otherwise it's useless, and the 100:1 action to introspection ratio sounds about right to me.

[03:35:29] <Betawolf> That bit about the civil service seems... right? Is the poster suggesting they _should_ have 'removed' everyone who was in the Nazi party?
[03:36:25] <kiboneu> good morn
[03:39:39] <quanticle> Betawolf: The point I'm trying to make is that, in the post-war, even after the full range of Nazi atrocities had been known, there were still people who were like, "The Nazis weren't *that* bad,"
[03:39:50] <quanticle> "Not like those Asiatic Soviet Mongoloids"
[03:40:28] <quanticle> So this whole notion of American society decisively uniting against Naziism has basically no basis in historical fact
[03:41:42] <Betawolf> Sure, Naziism was a sort of pan-Germanism, it was ideologically more of a tragedy that they ended up fighting powerful Germanic empires.
[03:44:06] <quanticle> Every time I see stuff like this I think of that Slate Star Codex piece where he says that Nazis lost the war of ideas, and no punching was involved. And I'm like, "Not only was there quite a lot of punching involved, as well as many things quite a bit more violent than punching," it's not even clear that all that punching really caused them to lose the war of ideas!
[03:44:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Wow, that's quite a read
[03:45:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: These days it's easy to forget how much anti-semitism there used to be in American society, and how pervasive it was, but boy was there a whole lot of it...
[03:45:46] <Betawolf> well, sure, but it was trendy everywhere at the time
[03:45:59] <Betawolf> (and indeed before the time)
[03:46:08] <quanticle> And with regards to the civil servants, the point the author is trying to make is that Patton could have appealed to pragmatic necessity. He could have said, "Well, I dislike Nazis just as much as the next person, but they're the only people who know how things work," but he did not. Instead he explicitly defended being a member of the Nazi party, saying it was no different than being a member
[03:46:10] <quanticle> of the Republican or Democratic party in the United States.
[03:46:42] <Betawolf> but the quote from his diary sounds perfectly sensible
[03:47:00] <quanticle> And indeed, Eisenhower did replace him as administrator of Bavaria
[03:47:24] <Betawolf> unless it's just the author pointing out that he considered Jews as bad as Communists
[03:47:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Well... insofar as being in the Nazi party was different than being in the Democratic party, it seems to me that the former is more "defensible" (in the sense that it's more necessary and more decoupled from personal convictions; not, of course, in the sense of the Nazi party being somehow less bad than the D/R parties, that would be silly)
[03:48:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Similarly the Communist party in the USSR
[03:48:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here, why would you ever join the Dems or Reps unless you actively wanted to because you genuinely had strong political beliefs? There's no reason at all
[03:48:48] <Betawolf> good point
[03:49:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> In Nazi Germany (or, again, the Soviet Union), well, if you don't join, you're fired / not promoted / not hired / possibly suspect / possibly in actual danger
[03:49:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Variously of those, depending on which of the two societies we are talking about, and the time period, etc.)
[03:50:57] <quanticle> Anyway, all this makes me feel a bit better when people say that society should align against meat eaters the same way it aligned against Nazis
[03:51:07] <spxtr> who says that?
[03:51:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: re: "it was trendy everywhere", I think that there may very well have been less antisemitism in *Russia* than in America, in the 30s/40s/50s
[03:51:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: People on Less Wrong, who else?
[03:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And ACX)

The same is true for scenarios. ‚ÄúA mouse...
[05:34:17] <gwern> ...hunting a lion‚Äù is most likely not a scenario easily found within the dataset. By conditioning on scenes in the form of simple sketches, we are able to attend to these uncommon objects and scenarios, as demonstrated in Fig. 3, despite the fact that some objects do not exist as categories in our scene (mouse, lion). We solve the category gap by using categories that may be close in...

[12:49:25] <PapuaHardyNet> how can you be flamboyantly trans?
[12:50:10] <PapuaHardyNet> let me see, based on stereotypes in my head: wear stockings, program rust, go to conferences, wear skirts, post pictures of self with a mask wearing feminine clothes, uhhh
[12:50:36] <synthmeat> i think you gotta watch a bit of ru paul :D
[12:50:40] <dbohdan[phone]> I think the username is simply an in-joke
[12:50:40] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I'm pretty sure these things are very tame. Being trans is very normalized.

[12:54:56] <PapuaHardyNet> ... aren't most drag queens men cross-dressing? So all you add is a more feminine body? That's just hot, not flamboyantly trans. It's like saying that a stripper is flamboyantly female.

[16:45:41] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, yeah, about half a decade or more
[16:54:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think it's that much...
[16:57:09] <nshepperd2> > Life expectancy at birth for males was 75.1 years in the first half of 2020, representing a decline of 1.2 years from 76.3 years in 2019. For females, life expectancy declined to 80.5 years, decreasing 0.9 year from 81.4 years in 2019 (Figure 1).
[16:57:22] <nshepperd2> from some random cdc document that was the first google hit
[16:57:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm
[16:57:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright
[16:58:08] <kuudes> it has reduced a little but still is "about half a decade"
[16:58:11] <kuudes> https://www.demogr.mpg.de/Papers/Working/wp-1999-009.pdf for instance
[16:58:17] <Robomot> PDF (9 pages; 201 KB) - Male‚Äìfemale Differences in Mortality in the Developed World (Arjan Gjon√ßa, Cecilia Tomassini, James W. Vaupel)
[16:58:33] <kuudes> varies between countries, some countries have less than 5 years
[16:59:25] <kuudes> uk seems to have lower difference in many reports than most other developed countries
[17:02:02] <PapuaHardyNet> "The volumes of sexually dimorphic brain structures in transgender women were found to change and approximate typical female brain structures when exposed to estrogen concomitantly with androgen deprivation over a period of months,[31] suggesting that estrogen and/or androgens have a significant part to play in sex differentiation of the brain, both prenatally and later in life." interesting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol

[17:03:59] <kuudes> another proposition is that monthly bloodletting could be causal to longevity
[17:04:13] <kuudes> as blood donation is connected to longer lifespan in males as well iirc
[17:07:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Reversed ? is added
[17:07:46] <nshepperd2> i would assume that was just because unhealthy people don't donate blood
[17:08:16] <kuudes> that is possible as well
[17:08:23] <kuudes> as so often, causes are hard
[17:09:14] <dbohdan[phone]> I thought the same as nshepperd2 
[17:14:10] <ojarvini> Does anyone know whether any RCTs have been conducted on that?
[17:14:31] <kuudes> they would take decades?
[17:15:06] <ojarvini> I guess
[17:15:15] <kuudes> so at least they are unlikely to have got concluded
[17:15:48] <ojarvini> But I'd say that RCTs on blood donation looking at things other than longevity would be interesting as well
[17:16:08] <ojarvini> (I.e. short term effects)
[17:18:09] <nshepperd> if the theory is that bloodletting is removing SASP, you could look at metrics of inflammation or something
[17:18:26] <ojarvini> E.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC484902/ claims reduced risk of "cardiovascular events", but it's not an RCT

[18:00:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes sure
[18:01:49] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: part of that belongs in the "code samples" section I think; a snippet says more than three paragraphs
[18:01:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: This "why" section makes me want to try Neat.
[18:01:59] <feep> (note: code samples section is not written yet)
[18:02:07] <dbohdan[phone]> feep: I like the writing style. I'd change some punctuation, but it is too difficult to point out from mobile. "Neat uses automatic reference counting as its memory management strategy, using lifetimes to mostly avoid forcing users to think about this" -- you should explain what lifetimes are in the context, so nobody mistakes your language for a Rust workalike.

[18:03:13] <feep> it could be good though!
[18:03:45] <feep> the way macros work at the moment is as a ... like, if you could add a feature to the compiler, you can add it as a macro instead
[18:03:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The thing about using old versions of the compiler is incredibly awesome and you need to put that shit in bold
[18:03:52] <feep> but you're still effectively writing compiler code.
[18:04:15] <feep> there's room for a better syntax there, allowing easy syntax destructuring and rewriting

[19:35:25] <two2thehead> Talk Radio/other broadcast audio entertainment is screwed
[19:39:31] <gwern> nah. even with self-driving cars, regular driving will be around forever. the self-driving cars are just too expensive and too much locked-up capital, while the costs of your own car are invisible
[19:39:55] <gwern> the same way that cooking your own food remains the majority of calories, even though you'd think that specialized commercial kitchens could beat it
[19:40:13] <gwern> self-driving cars will also be much more heavily regulated and taxed and the lily gilded
[19:40:34] <gwern> "how can you possibly oppose making them safer? Remember Little Suzie!"
[19:41:03] <two2thehead> hm :-/
[19:41:04] <gwern> the same way that one person getting sick at chipotle is a scandal and halves the stock, while a dozen people dying at home of their own cooking is a statistic
[19:41:34] <gwern> think about the very long drives in rural areas
[19:41:51] <gwern> you're not going to have a lot of roving robot cars in the middle of nowhere with 1 person per square mile
[19:41:56] <two2thehead> Okay, how about... as the boomers retire, more and more of them *won't* listen to talk radio? Sub-set of a subset change
[19:42:25] <gwern> yeah, zoomers don't listen to radio, that seems to be true. but they are listening to podcasts instead
[19:42:53] <two2thehead> iirc the median talk radio listener ~60
[19:42:56] <two2thehead> 'Two of the most popular radio formats, all news and news/talk, reach listeners whose median age is outside the coveted 25-54 year-old demo. The median age of news/talk stations is 56, while the median age for listeners of all news outlets is 59'
