[00:41:42] <danso> i am trying to disable ctrl+w to close a tab and remap ctrl+c to close instead of copy. i have had success by changing browserSets.ftl in browser/omni.ja, except that ctrl+c doesn't close when the address bar is focused. any tips where to look next?

[00:42:55] <nerdcore> I'm trying to remove extra vertical spacing in my Tab Bar. I have this set in my userChrome.css but it doesn't seem to be effective for some reason. When I use the Browser Toolkit to modify the style of the tab bar, disabling this setting gives me what I want, so how do I do this in userChrome.css? https://paste.debian.net/1233134/
[00:46:14] <nerdcore> the style for --tab-min-height is always 36px for some reason; far bigger than what I desire :(
[00:50:04] <akik> nerdcore: i do it like this https://atkdinosaurus.wordpress.com/2021/06/04/how-to-get-normal-tabs-back-with-firefox-89-0/

[00:54:04] <nerdcore> akik: I tried your tweaks previously including the dark MATE theme from that link. The 32px --tab-min-height is far too large for me, but I cannot seem to override it. Any suggestions for that specific attribute?
[00:55:18] <nerdcore> if I set mine to "0px !important" in userChrome.css then when I launch FF its still 32px. When I disable that attribute entirely using Browser Toolbox it gives me the look and feel I desire. How do I turn this min-height off, disable it, or otherwise override to 0px?
[00:56:25] <akik> nerdcore: ok sorry i didn't remember i had pasted that earlier
[00:56:44] <akik> nerdcore: the settings above made a difference that i added recently

[01:02:05] <akik> i'll test tomorrow
[01:03:05] <nerdcore> browser.css:5119 is the selector for ":root" in my version here, and it sets "--tab-min-height: 32px;" and I cannot seem to override this in userChrome.css :(
[01:03:18] <nerdcore> if I could set that to 0px I'd be happy
[01:03:50] <nerdcore> but despite "!important", it seems to always load this value as 32px
[01:07:19] <akik> oh well i'll check the config now

[01:39:56] <akik> maybe reddit firefoxcss would know
[01:40:31] <nerdcore> I've just become super frustrated from years of GNOME+FF expanding vertical margins. I need large fonts, not large gaps between a line of text and a content area like the browser viewport
[01:40:40] <nerdcore> I'd like tight tabs, tight URL bar and tight bookmarks bar
[01:41:05] <nerdcore> bloody GNOME puts 6px margin around everything; I argued for like 10 hours with the gnome designers last week haha
[01:41:12] <akik> heh
[01:41:23] <akik> i remember when i tested gnome some years ago
[01:41:34] <akik> it's some silly design thing 
[01:41:54] <nerdcore> i got to the point where gnome designers told me to use XFCE or KDE instead :P
[01:42:03] <akik> but you can fix those with css too
[01:42:23] <nerdcore> problem is: I like GNOME and I like FF, just dislike huge vertical margins. I have a mouse, not a touchscreen, so I don't need things to have massive gaps around them
[01:42:52] <akik> i fear the next time i have to buy a laptop
[01:43:06] <akik> if i can find a one with no bs features
[01:44:25] <nerdcore> i gotta run shortly, but I'll push my userChrome.css to gh and send a link. Maybe akik or others could offer specific guidance if you see what I'm working with here
[01:45:01] <akik> i can test tomorrow again, not today :)
[01:45:19] <akik> what happens if i remove the --tab-min-height
[01:48:04] <nerdcore> its a mess haha: https://github.com/nerdcorenet/nerdtheme/blob/master/firefox/userChrome.css

[21:23:16] <WaltS48> Hello, fellow other 269 participants of this channel! You sure are quiet.
[21:27:43] <t4nk_freenode> Sorry, we're in a zoom meeting right now
[21:27:49] <t4nk_freenode> come back in 5 houts
[21:27:51] <t4nk_freenode> hours
[21:29:23] <WaltS48> I'll be done test the Thunderbird 91.7.0 release candidate in one.
[21:29:52] <WaltS48> In five I'll be watching the Snooker tournament final.
[21:30:26] <t4nk_freenode> heh, there's something I gave up on years ago
[21:32:03] <WaltS48> I wasn't aware of it five years ago. Did you get tired of Ronnie winning all the time?
[21:32:38] <WaltS48> Judd Trump and Joe Perry in this match.
[21:33:03] <t4nk_freenode> when I say years ago, I mean years ago ;)
[21:33:18] <t4nk_freenode> who are they? ;)
[21:33:37] <WaltS48> Safety play can be boring. But, I understand the skill involved.
[21:34:15] <t4nk_freenode> I remember watching White lose to Hendry, when he was up by a trillion frames and just needed one I think
[21:37:10] <WaltS48> That was years ago. Trump was down 5-3 in the semi yesterday and won 6-5.
[21:42:43] <WaltS48> Who they are.
[21:42:46] <WaltS48> https://wst.tv/rankings/world-rankings-2/
[21:49:18] <WaltS48> Ronnie holds the most ranking titles at 38. As a six-time world champion, a seven-time Masters champion and a seven-time UK champion, he has won a record 20 Triple Crown titles.
[21:49:54] <WaltS48> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O'Sullivan
[21:51:39] <WaltS48> Anyway, have a productive meeting.

[22:45:27] <Ady> hello
[22:45:35] <Ady> can you help me?
[22:46:31] <Caspy7[m]> Ady: best to just ask your question and if someone has input they can chime in
[22:47:51] <Ady> I use Arkenfox, "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed" is active but I put Exceptions. I can't stay signed in after restart though 
[22:48:14] <Ady> if i disable  "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed" i can stay signed in 
[22:50:20] *** Joins: msg75 (~jack@user/msg75)
[22:50:50] <Ady> no one knows what's wrong there?
[22:54:40] <Caspy7[m]> Ady: you're saying that you don't stay signed in on the exceptions you set up?
[22:55:21] <Ady> Caspy7[m] yep
[22:55:49] <Ady> but if i disable "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed" I stay signed in
[22:56:39] <Caspy7[m]> sure, there's no reason you'd be signed out if you disabled that
[22:57:21] <Ady> Well it's quite weird, on instagram if i disable that "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed" and active it back I stay signed in thanks to exception
[22:57:35] <Ady> the same doens't work for other websites
[22:58:58] <Ady> on other websites i got signed off if I active that even is I set exceptions 
[23:00:03] <Caspy7[m]> Ady: one thing you might try would be to use about:profiles to create a profile to test in and see if it gets the same behavior. Wondering if there's something wonky in yours
