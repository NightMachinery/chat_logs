[02:36:30] <brownorange> the TL;DR is you think the consistency of a formal system implies a liar sentence at the meta-level, you're committed to (A->A) actually proving the liar sentence at the object level. because (A->A) is actually provable. so proving consistency is no worse.

[15:34:34] <wasd> Yes, the self defence.  There's some of that in the Putin perspective "Self defence against continuing NATO aggression".  also "Self Defence of the Ukrainians against the Ukrainian Nazis" - despite the President being Jewish.

[16:14:22] <amigojapan> it would be unreasonable ot make too many rules about what kids can play in the playground
[16:23:39] <wasd> amigojapan: health and safety tends to be the main reason (at least in the uk - see conkers / british bulldogs etc)
[16:23:55] <mrig> I wouldn't say that I am strictly a pacifist, but do very much strive for ahimsa.
[16:24:22] <mrig> competition is for children, so long as we do eventually grow up, war is not really an issue.
[16:24:47] <amigojapan> wasd:health and safte of the people in the ocuntry?
[16:25:01] <mrig> but if you found your entire existence about competition, then war is inevitable.
[16:27:13] <amigojapan> wasd: I went to a page hosted by russia, which explains the way they are reporting the war there and they are saying things like they believe the ukrain has split up into two countries and they are helping bring stability to the region, that is their side of the story as well as I can remember it
[16:29:58] <mrig> In fact the competitive amongst us, you will often hear justifying war due to its being our very nature, it is all that they see; It is their natures. They do not see that they are in reality a minority though. It is just that they are an aggressive minority.
[16:30:56] <mrig> Something that irks me, is that these fools are not the ones who fight in this age, they are cowards who get the poor to fight for them.
[16:31:13] <mrig> There is something to be said for valour and courage.
[16:32:41] <amigojapan> mrig: its not real valor and courage if you are just blindly following orders from above
[16:33:35] <amigojapan> mrig: valor and courage would often entail disobeying orders
[16:34:04] <amigojapan> but I rather not get into a violent organization like an army to begin with
[16:35:50] <wasd> amigojapan: thanks.  I think it is that picture at least.  'helping to bring stability' but it's an old trick, especially if they arm the "separatists" in the first place. I can't make any sense of it but maybe war is some kind of madness anyway, impossible to rationalise.
[16:37:49] <amigojapan> wasd actually I think there is reason behind it, psychologically it is easier to kill someone who is not referd to as human, or even better as an animal or insect of some sort. not humans like you
[16:38:04] <amigojapan> evil resoning

[16:39:10] <amigojapan> right mrig

[16:40:21] <wasd> amigojapan: so, the dehumanisation language, sure.  Not all soldiers could be psychopaths so they need something, a reason.  Nationalism, Fear, Moral Certainty / dogmatism etc
[16:41:29] <mrig> Hiding behind the and scenes manipulating, it is an unfortunate facet of bureaucracy that it assists these types.

[16:58:17] <amigojapan> as it should be
[16:58:45] <mrig> now add to this thoughts of UN involvement in antics such as the trade of women for prostitution. That sort of thing.
[16:59:12] <mrig> it does not take a math wiz to do the sums.
[16:59:35] <amigojapan> I never heard of that, but it is possible
[16:59:53] <mrig> oh sure, there was a great film made about it.

[17:04:53] <mrig> just that it works by negating the fight.
[17:05:15] <amigojapan> by the way, acording to the UN the urkrain is not a menber of UN, wait is the UN the same as NATO?

[17:12:57] <amigojapan> yup
[17:13:03] <mrig> ah right, thought so.
[17:13:03] <wasd> so, outside of europe, I think it's just canada and us.
[17:14:04] <wasd> it's supposed to be a european defensive group, i.e. attack one is an attack on all.  I guess if they could sign up the whole world, we'd end wars :)

[17:20:53] <amigojapan> wasd most people form the UK, I have met have been against brexit
[17:21:32] <wasd> amigojapan: yes but from the vote it was pretty much 50/50.  Maybe you just didn't meet the other ones yet (or they don't admit it anymore).
[17:21:55] <amigojapan> I see wasd
[17:22:58] <wasd> there was a big socio-economic split on it, with a lot of people in poor areas being told things would improve if they voted to leave.  A v.big propaganda campaign.
[17:23:00] <mrig> amigojapan this issue of living in a bubble that reflects your current belief is an issue created by social media more than anything else. To such an extent that I think that government agencies are actually jealous and want in on it.
[17:23:38] <mrig> curious the way that this status quo evolved or emerged.
[17:25:41] <amigojapan> mrig: maybe I live in a buble too, cause most of my information I get it from IRC
[17:25:41] <wasd> I don't think believing the stories of your tribe is a social media thing, if that's what you mean.

[17:31:42] <wasd> or jainism.

[17:32:55] <wasd> I'll try to share without flood.
[17:33:02] <wasd> A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable".
[17:33:03] <amigojapan> mrig: lol
[17:33:08] <wasd> So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan.
[17:33:12] <wasd> As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, "is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.
[17:33:17] <mrig> Their are quacks in the analyst field as much as any other :D
[17:33:41] <mrig> Let us hope that those quacks are not advising gouvernment.
[17:34:19] <wasd> I suspect it's rooted in the Jain belief which states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language.
