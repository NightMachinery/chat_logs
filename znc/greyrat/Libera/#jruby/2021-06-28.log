[19:54:27] <RobertNicholas[m> that's by size / packed size

[19:54:28] <RobertNicholas[m> seems like the bulk is in stdlib (no surprise)
[19:54:29] <RobertNicholas[m> oh lemme grab the full built jar good point
[19:54:29] <headius> This looks like the 27MB version?

[19:54:29] <headius> I hear ya, starting some coffee myself

[19:54:30] <RobertNicholas[m> hmm, I've just remove the shadow plugin to see what the size looked like without it, gonna have to do some more digging on this one I think
[19:54:30] <RobertNicholas[m> totally haven't had tea yet this morning :P
[19:54:30] <RobertNicholas[m> I have a feeling it's putting more than just jruby in there from the look of that
[20:31:25] <headius> wow yes
[20:31:26] <headius> sources getting included?
[20:46:05] <headius> ugh why is intellij crashing today

[20:46:06] <headius> basshelal: I review fzakaria comments today and we can get that PR merged in
[20:46:06] <headius> once I can get into IDE ðŸ™„
[20:46:06] <headius> bleh, MacOS security thing
[20:46:06] <headius> I'm back

[20:49:44] <headius> Robert Nicholas: when you say "compiled jruby" what exactly do you mean?
[20:51:31] <RobertNicholas[m> compiled in a java project's build.gradle
[20:51:55] <RobertNicholas[m> so it's included in another jar file
[20:52:02] <headius> ah so basically building your own "complete" version embedded into a larger jar, with additional gems
[20:52:39] <headius> this seems like the jruby gradle plugins could help perhaps? They are fairly minimal right now but could be enhanced
[20:53:34] <RobertNicholas[m> essentially an end user will not download or use jruby directly
[20:53:43] <headius> it is mostly just a matter of mimicking the layout in the complete jar but I don't think we really have a standard utility/plugin to do that
[20:53:53] <headius> the complete jar is assembled pretty manually by the maven build
[20:54:07] <headius> and just includes gems we have in the lib pom.rb
[20:54:31] <headius> (we do not like how these things are built currently but have not had time to replace it)
[21:02:29] <RobertNicholas[m> yeah, essentially I'm trying to be able to do something like:
[21:02:29] <RobertNicholas[m> `java -jar rubycore-0.0.1.jar -S gem install rubyzip`
[21:02:30] <RobertNicholas[m> or even installing a gem from the ruby / java code itself. An end user isn't going to have a system ruby installed, but I want to be able to install gems with the jruby located inside of my mod's jar where jruby (and the ruby scripts loaded by my java program) can access them
[21:12:04] <headius> oooo I see
[21:12:36] <headius> But these would not be able to go back into a jar right? They would go somewhere on filesystem?
[21:13:07] <headius> I thought this worked already, installing into .gem or something
[21:13:15] <headius> .gems
[21:13:43] <RobertNicholas[m> on the filesystem is fine but the question is how can I install a gem on the system when they don't have jruby-complete.jar on their system
[21:18:18] <headius> aha
[21:19:07] <headius> if the jruby-complete contents get stuffed into your jar it should just be something like java -classpath yourjar.jar org.jruby.Main -S gem install rubyzip
[21:19:30] <RobertNicholas[m> oh really I'll give that a try
[21:19:42] <headius> it is all still there in proper paths so I think it should work
[21:36:51] <headius> basshelal: I just commented that I think we should merge and fix/cleanup bits and pieces in separate PRs. Leaving open for one more day to hear from fzakaria and possible enebo 
[21:37:09] <headius> enebo: if you get a chance today: https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi/pull/247
[21:40:21] <fzakaria[m]> headius: thanks; I think it's OK.
[21:40:21] <fzakaria[m]> High level I think it's a bit complicated but it's building on the original code so I agree with your assessment.
[21:41:39] <headius> ok cool
[22:16:10] <enebo[m]> I looked at it the other week and did not see anything which stood out
[22:16:12] <enebo[m]> so I guess I also think it is ok
[22:31:33] <headius> ok
[22:31:34] <headius> merging!
