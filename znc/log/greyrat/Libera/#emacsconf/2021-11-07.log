[07:14:06] <sachac> codingquark: Hmm, your OGV seems to be missing audio for 00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:30.110
[07:14:37] <sachac> Let me doublecheck...
[07:15:52] <sachac> Oh, that's just because you're doing the demo =)
[07:15:53] <sachac> Whew
[07:15:56] <sachac> everything is fine
[07:16:48] <sachac> You just don't say "by running the make target for bootstrap-borg"

[07:59:53] <codingquark> sachac: ya, I thought about adding some extra talks during that time, but then I justified against it by arguing "today is the deadline, and the world does not end because of it"
[08:00:18] <codingquark> If it feels super odd, I'll edit the video to say "Yes, this is silence, feel it!"
[08:20:33] <sachac> It is fine =)
[08:21:09] <sachac> I edited the text to match the audio so that people don't worry 
[08:27:35] <sachac> (that is, the text for the captions. Because you have captions now, yay!)
[09:13:17] <sachac> bhavin192: Looks like Youtube will mostly figure out the start and end times of captions if we upload text from the speakers' scripts, but it doesn't give us word-level timing data, so splitting it is slightly more annoying. It might be possible to split the text first and then upload it to Youtube to see if it will figure out the timing then. I'm going to bed now, but if you want to caption another talk, you can pick either the GNU's
[09:13:18] <sachac> Not UNIX talk or the Finding Your (In)voice talk. =) Both have .org files and an auto-timed .vtt or .srt.

[18:53:39] <bhavin192> sachac, I think you had tried YouTube's UI where we can paste text and it figures out timing. So, after uploading manual caption text, it doesn't generate srv2 and other formats?
[18:53:56] <bhavin192> I was away the whole day. I will be continuing with the Nyxt talk, it might take a day or two more. Let's see. 
[18:54:19] <sachac> It generates srv2, but at the line level, not at the word level
[18:55:23] <bhavin192> Oh, interesting :D
[19:01:34] <sachac> I'll tinker with it some more. might just need to work out a more efficient way to do the waveforms
[19:01:45] <sachac> so we can use them for timing

[19:02:23] <bhavin192> For some talks the waveforms are mostly flat, is it because of low volume level?

[19:04:01] <sachac> I wonder if I can send YouTube a file with one word per line :)
