[02:06:44] <MadCamel> just make sure whatever you use to work with the wallet is reasonably secure. malware's getting pretty hip to various wallet strategies and can snatch it the millisecond it's decrypted.

[05:06:11] <jochum> I want to be secure from hackers
[05:06:21] <jochum> We
[05:06:37] <jochum> So if we have a breach on the server(s) noone can access it.

[05:06:40] <Platonides> wrong answer, I'm afraid
[05:06:45] <Hash> So encrypt the data in motion, when transmitted to the device, and encrypt data when stored on the device at rest. Decrypt only when the app needs to access the data and display it.
[05:06:46] <Platonides> they could attack your recovery mechanism
[05:07:03] <jochum> Hash: thats what are planing for.

[05:07:22] <jochum> Its every-day-stats app
[05:07:22] <[iz]> can't have your cake and eat it too
[05:07:38] <[iz]> it's either securely encrypted and a pain to deal with or it's neither

[05:09:23] <jochum> Hash: we don't fall into HIPAA I think also I'm European.
[05:09:24] <[iz]> you could encrypt a second copy just for recovery to a recovery key pair
[05:09:58] <[iz]> when you still have the plaintext on the device as you are encrypting the user copy
[05:10:01] <jochum> He thinks people don't want to print out theier key especialy the older ones.
[05:10:23] <[iz]> but again, that kinda undermines the point of the encryption in the first place
[05:10:25] <Platonides> how do they sign up?
[05:10:33] <Hash> I am failing to understand as the most basic information isn't provided about the functionality of the app

[05:10:46] <Platonides> I would print it for them when they are physically there,

[05:11:28] <Hash> That's not what I'm asking.
[05:11:30] <jochum> Basicaly we ask and collect questions :)
[05:11:46] <Hash> The more information you can provide, the better answers you may get

[05:11:57] <Hash> ^^
[05:12:14] <jochum> Platonides: well then you don't know me :)
[05:12:27] <Hash> We can't advise properly unless we know more about how the app functions. No need to divulge trade secrets.
[05:12:30] <Hash> Are you a developer?
[05:12:34] <jochum> yes
[05:12:34] <Platonides> of course I don't :)
[05:12:46] <Platonides> and I mean the security parts
[05:13:02] <Platonides> not the business idea, or the look and feel
[05:13:16] <Hash> I don't even understand what security design was put forth for it to be weak
[05:13:20] <jochum> If it would be allone mine I would encrypt client side and done.
[05:13:33] <Platonides> I suspect there is not even a clear threat model
[05:13:47] <Hash> Hash | What is the data, its value, and why does it need encryption?
[05:14:03] <Platonides> note that if the data was shared with others
[05:14:06] <Platonides> such as a doctor
[05:14:10] <jochum> We ask daily for your weight for example and create stats
[05:14:12] <Platonides> they could share it back with the patient
[05:14:16] <Platonides> if he lost the initial device
[05:14:31] <Hash> You need to do risk assessment, and find out potential threats, and come up with a plan of action to deal with threats
[05:14:55] <Hash> Without that it won't be possible to determine the best security model
[05:14:56] <Platonides> another point is that the app security is a selling factor
[05:15:16] <Platonides> you could sell that you won't sell their data, since you won't have access to it at all
[05:15:31] <Platonides> I have seen a similar app
[05:15:37] <Platonides> saying that it has an offline mode
[05:15:40] <jochum> Thats what i want to not my friend and partner.
[05:15:46] <Platonides> it could send the data to the company server
[05:15:48] <Hash> If the goal is to have the server be blind to any communication, then that's going to be a tough one using key pairs.
[05:15:51] <Platonides> or it could stay locally on the device
[05:16:06] <Hash> You can't have just one app key and multiple public keys for users
[05:16:11] <Platonides> so the company doesn't have your weight at all
[05:16:17] <Hash> You'd need a key pair for every user/device
[05:16:21] <Platonides> of course, if the user lost / broke his phone
[05:16:25] <Platonides> will lose the data
[05:16:35] <Hash> If they lose the key or the device it's all gone.
[05:16:35] <jochum> Hey I know a lot about for example SSH keys, TLS and stuff.
[05:16:37] <Platonides> it's expected
[05:16:46] <Hash> Storing private keys of users on the server defeats the purpose
[05:17:03] <Hash> So users need a way to backup their keys locally
[05:17:25] <jochum> Thats what I told him
[05:17:36] <jochum> Then he said, what If people want theier data back
[05:17:39] <Platonides> depending on the data, having the users backup them in e.g. google drive might be acceptable
[05:17:40] <jochum> I said no possible.
[05:17:41] <Hash> The app can generate key pairs for the user who installs the app, but again,you can't store their private key, as that defeats it, and you can't help them if they lose the key
[05:17:54] <jochum> I can store the public key
[05:17:59] <Hash> That doesn't matter.
[05:17:59] <jochum> But I don't want to.
[05:18:09] <Platonides> you need to store the public key
[05:18:11] <jochum> My partner thinks we have to
[05:18:21] <Platonides> hmm
[05:18:33] <Platonides> do you do anything at all with the data?
[05:18:37] <jochum> But once we store a public key, I have to encrypt that one
[05:18:50] <Hash> you want to encrypt public keys?
[05:18:51] <jochum> Platonides: we think about doing so
[05:18:53] <Platonides> maybe the server is superfluous as well
[05:19:02] <Hash> Ok. What happens when the user loses their private key?
[05:19:31] <jochum> Hash: I thought about decrpyting with the public and provide a way to encrypt without another private one
[05:19:43] <jochum> s/without/with/
[05:19:45] <Hash> Provide a way how?
[05:20:15] <jochum> An API to let the user download-delete-upload his data
[05:20:17] <Hash> I fear you may not fully understand the assymetric key model
[05:20:34] <jochum> I think I do
[05:21:13] <jochum> I just dont know if theres a key which cannot decrypt its own data.
[05:21:19] <jochum> I think there isn't
[05:21:24] <Hash> What does that mean?
[05:21:37] <jochum> Encrypt Public Keys Server side
[05:21:38] <Hash> A key's own data is the very key itself.
[05:21:44] <jochum> But no way to decrypt them
[05:21:52] <jochum> except with the master key which is offline
[05:22:27] <jochum> Thats the thing I'm searching for at the moment.
[05:23:34] <jochum> I believe theres no such encryption method that allows a foreign key to decrypt its data, its against encryption laws I believe.
[05:23:56] <Hash> 'foreign key' is a concept in relational databases
[05:23:57] <jochum> And doesn't allow its encryption key to decrypt
[05:24:11] <Hash> Not in encryption.
[05:24:28] <Platonides> jochum: you are quite lost with the concepts
[05:25:06] <jochum> Thank you both
[05:25:29] <Hash> I wish we could have helped more, but we'd need more information
[05:25:30] <Platonides> we shared our view
[05:26:29] <[iz]> a public key is an encryption key that cannot decrypt its own data.. that's the whole point of it
[05:26:33] <jochum> I said medical app well its more a app that helps you to understand your past, by answering questions each day.
[05:27:23] <jochum> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#/media/File:Public_key_encryption.svg
[05:27:24] <secbot> ^ Public-key cryptography - Wikipedia
[05:28:00] <[iz]> if you are using public keys and you think there's no such thing as an encryption method that encrypts but cannot decrypt without a different key.. you are probably misunderstanding a few things
[05:28:49] <Platonides> jochum: why would someone want to share their personal answers with your company?
[05:28:52] <jochum> encrypt with one, decrypt with another. I know that exists.
[05:29:25] <Hash> jochum: two people now have mentioned it. Perhaps you ought to read about and do some research on assymetric key cryptography
[05:29:28] <jochum> encrypt with one and not decrypt with that one, I didn't know that also Public key.
[05:29:46] <Hash> We're trying to be helpful but you seem to lack some fundamental understanding
[05:29:53] <jochum> Hash: yes, seems so. I thought I knew it, I don't. Sorry.
[05:29:59] <Hash> Np.
[05:30:05] <Platonides> well, that's the first step

[05:31:52] <jochum> Same as I do, I know a lot about Programming and Linux but not about cryptography
[05:34:05] <Platonides> well, no shame in that
[05:34:29] <Platonides> better not to try designign a cryptosystem fow now, though
[05:34:36] <jochum> Yeah
[05:34:52] <Platonides> and even if you were someone like Bruce Schneider, that could still be a bad idea :P
[05:34:55] <jochum> Do you know a system that does Public key encryption, privat key decryption ?
[05:35:07] <Platonides> pgp
[05:35:18] <Hash> GNU PG
[05:35:27] <Platonides> although for your app, I would probably base on something like NaCl
[05:35:40] <Platonides> or Salt
[05:35:42] <jochum> NaCl, heard about it.
[05:36:03] <Platonides> that can help you
[05:36:10] <Platonides> but it's not just the primitives that should work ok
[05:36:24] <Platonides> you should combine them in a way which makes sense imho

[05:38:11] <jochum> I mean no recovery at all.
[05:38:15] <Platonides> with what we know so far
[05:38:33] <[iz]> it's not appropriate, esp for devices that aren't constantly connected

[05:39:15] <Platonides> it's one of its selling points
[05:39:27] <jochum> Thank you! All 3 of you.
[05:39:27] <Platonides> otherwise you could simply use OTR
[05:39:36] <[iz]> it resumes fine, but they need to have lots of back and forth
[05:39:41] <Platonides> but it's a complexity which isn't warranted here
[05:39:50] <jochum> True
[05:40:08] <[iz]> i guess i meant w/ a higher bandwidth bidirecitonal communication
[05:40:28] <Platonides> in your case, I suspect you could end up with a key derived from the user password
[05:40:35] <Platonides> and encrypting with that
[05:40:54] <Platonides> the user could retrieve the data on a different device if he remembered their password
[05:41:26] <Platonides> they might use crappy ones such as Password1!
[05:41:37] <Platonides> but it probably ticks most of your requisites

[18:02:19] <Hash> There are certain security and usability considerations which should be taken into account when using the PIN for PIV management, instead of a Management Key.
[18:02:36] <Hash> When choosing to use a Management Key derived from the PIN, the following takes place:
[18:02:39] <Hash> A random 8-byte SALT value is generated and stored on the YubiKey.
[18:02:48] <Hash> The derived Management Key is calculated as PBKDF2(PIN, SALT, 24, 10000).
[18:03:01] <Hash> The PBKDF2 function (described in RFC 2898) is run using the PIN (encoded using UTF-8) as the password, for 10000 rounds, to produce a 24 byte key, which is used as the management key.
