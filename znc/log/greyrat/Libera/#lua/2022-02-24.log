[11:23:34] <Elw3> Uhrg, randomly seeing a benchmark chart of languages and lua being at the bottom places. Whodaheck wrote the benchmar that shitty?
[11:43:33] <kakolainen[m]> or maybe Lua is just slow?
[11:43:33] <daddy> Elw3: 99% of the time it's a benchmark that makes heavy use of native bindings
[11:44:13] <daddy> It's usually not that the specific benchmark is bad, it's that the other benchmarks typically aren't actually benchmarking the language they target
[11:45:16] <kakolainen[m]> Lua could benefit from automatic cuckoo filtering for tables to return nil early and perfect hashing for static const tables
[11:45:27] <Elw3> Ive did benches myself, its not slow, it its definetly not placed somewhere around python. not to forget that if used with luajit it wipes floor with every language.
[11:53:39] <Elw3> Actually most languages have more than one implementation, this benchmarks rarely say which one is used. Hows that fair? It sure makes languages look worse than they are supposed to look.
[11:54:51] <Elw3> And hows java in the top 5? 
[11:59:05] <kakolainen[m]> isin't Java the original jit language?
[12:03:07] <Elw3> no

[12:32:00] <rjek> Java's JIT has had decades of fine tuning, sure it's fast but start up time and resource consumption is hilarious.
[12:32:40] <rjek> But most of these benchmarks are somebody trying to explain why their favourite language is best by showing how bad they are at other languages.
[12:35:42] <andreyorst> thouhg, now that JVM has GraalVM startup time is no longer an issue, and memory usage is adjustable
[12:40:06] <Elw3> wait wait wait, this isnt about performance anymore in 2021. Its about being _green_ https://i.redd.it/z8cg4fh5n5j81.png
[12:42:24] <sham1> That's a weird way of measuring the "greenness" of a program, considering it doesn't account for things like compilation times and such
[12:42:57] <kakolainen[m]> doesn't take account programmer farting
[12:44:19] <Elw3> bullshitery

[12:47:16] <zutt> measuring energy consumption with benchmarks sounds a bit silly :thinking:
[12:47:50] <Elw3> I dont even know what those numbers are
[12:48:55] <sham1> The methodology seems dodgy
[12:48:57] <zutt> https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf the whitepaper behind that picture
[12:49:47] <Elw3> Downloading with 1.8kbs... wat?
[13:07:14] <ratchetfreak> powerdraw and performance are related
[13:08:08] <ratchetfreak> though not directly, but powerdraw has a more direct cost to report to management, if you can save 5% on your warehouse electricity cost they start paying attention
[13:08:21] <ratchetfreak> but if you report 1% lower average latency they don't care
[13:08:33] <Elw3> tru
[13:09:28] <Elw3> Bur the moral of that is that we now have a paper saying "use java and your company saves money"
[13:15:26] <andreyorst> the problem is, there aren't that many good runtimes/VMs on the market. Most widespread are Java and Python, and both have their downsides.
[13:17:49] <andreyorst> there are others, like guile or chez scheme, that can be used to build various kinds of languages upon those, but schemes arent very popular today
[13:19:09] <Elw3> Actually it all doesnt matter. 99% of that usage is made by how it was coded not in what language. No language is gonna save you when the programer puts in a busy loop instead sleep.
[13:19:51] <andreyorst> lua has a good vm, but it's restrained by it's main usecase of embedding and being relatively small. So it's unlikely that we'll have first party support of JIT any time soon.
[13:20:45] <andreyorst> Elw3: well, yes thankfully Lua can sleep with some help
[13:21:22] <Elw3> Its not exatcly witchcraft to call the C sleep.
[13:22:41] <Elw3> But more practical: Polling vs interrupt design. 
[13:23:56] <Elw3> I think unecessary polls are the biggest energy waster in programming in general.
[13:24:16] <andreyorst> yo can use os.execute "sleep 1" for a /real sleep/ but it's not portable to say the least
[13:24:38] <sham1> Yeah, the best thing to do is to have an event-based thing as opposed to poll
[13:24:59] <Elw3> of please dont give me os.execute when talking about efficiency... 
[13:25:04] <ratchetfreak> or the best of both worlds, a poll that sleeps when nothing is there to poll
[13:25:17] <sham1> You'd need to know if there's something to poll
[13:25:28] <Elw3> Yes exactly
[13:25:30] <andreyorst> Elw3: polling vs interrupt design is a linux vs windows debate I guess? I mean JVM can't use async io with interrupts on linux, they just spin threads for that
[13:25:32] <ratchetfreak> assuming the execute call doesn't do busi waiting itself...
[13:25:49] <ratchetfreak> java can do channel based IO
[13:26:03] <Elw3> I had that problem a while ago facing the state of a hardware that was unable to sent interputs.
[13:26:10] <ratchetfreak> that's what the whole java.nio package is about
[13:26:17] <sham1> Well a file descriptor should work like an interrupt, so you can "poll" it in a thread with a blocking read or whatever and then get notified
[13:26:28] <andreyorst> java.nio spins threads for each channel op using a threadpool under Linux
[13:27:07] <Elw3> I had to combine polling with a check that if there is an actual program using said piece of hardware.
[13:28:27] <Elw3> Is there actually a different way than blocked reads?

[13:42:44] <andreyorst> AFAIC the only real asynchronous way of doing it would be to registering a handler on an OS level that polls device driver that waits on CPU interrupt handler..

[20:39:23] <cocomo> yo is there a directory tree traversal library available for lua?
[20:39:50] <furq> luafilesystem
[20:41:00] <technomancy> I wonder how often the lua devs get asked to add an `ls` function
[20:41:47] <sham1> People don't seem to quite know of all the possible rocks available, so it does somewhat make sense
[20:42:04] <technomancy> there are very good reasons to avoid luarocks
[20:43:02] <sham1> Sure, but in general it's still something where people might not be necessarily aware enough of just how many libraries exist
[20:44:07] <bomb> silly pipl
[20:44:32] <technomancy> it's omitted specifically due to ... what was it, like ... c99 or something?
[20:44:39] <technomancy> 89?
[20:44:59] <technomancy> one of those pieces of ancient history
[20:45:06] <sham1> C1989 i.e. ANSI-C doesn't have filesystem functionality beyound what you get with FILE*
[20:45:14] <sham1> So no filesystem traversal and such
[20:45:33] <technomancy> sham1: C1989 Anno Domino
[20:48:51] <cocomo> furq: thank you, lfs.dir traverses entries of a single directory

[22:23:27] <nmz> there are reasons for everything
[22:23:32] <nmz> avoiding luarocks is strange
[22:23:38] <nmz> do you have an alternative technomancy ?
[22:25:29] <technomancy> nmz: for most things I just put libraries in git. if that is difficult I will use apt-get.
[22:26:01] <technomancy> if I put it in git then I know I'll always get reliable results and some new update won't fuck everything up by surprise
[22:26:03] <nmz> what does that mean?
[22:26:15] <technomancy> I know there's ways to pin things in luarocks but it's not well-documented
[22:26:18] <technomancy> nmz: which part?
[22:26:34] <nmz> you install everything by hand?
[22:27:02] <nmz> and you're suggesting that others should do the same?
[22:28:42] <technomancy> yeah so how is `luarocks install lume` easier than `cp ~/src/lume/lume.lua lib/`?
[22:29:10] <technomancy> the former is several orders of magnitude more complex with no advantages that I care about
[22:29:26] <nmz> you forgot the part where you have to configure make install
[22:29:38] <nmz> and have the proper prefixes
[22:29:38] <technomancy> in lume??
[22:29:46] <nmz> not lume
[22:29:51] <nmz> luarocks is not about lume
[22:29:58] <nmz> i don't even know what lume is
[22:30:15] <technomancy> ok, what I said was that for most libraries, I use git, and for others I use apt-get
[22:30:29] <technomancy> most of the libraries I use don't have configure/make/install
[22:31:21] <technomancy> in a few cases I bring in luasocket as a git subtree; it's like five lines in the makefile to build it; still much simpler than bringing in luarocks
[22:31:27] <nmz> technomancy: are you in telegram?
[22:31:38] <technomancy> you mean the chat program?
[22:31:46] <bomb> yes, Russian char program
[22:31:51] <nmz> someone is also pretty luarocks in the telegram lua chat, they're building a package manager as a replacement
[22:31:59] <nmz> against*
[22:32:03] <technomancy> never tried it
[22:32:15] <nmz> ah, was just wondering if it was you
[22:32:38] <technomancy> luarocks is kinda based on a 1990s design a la rubygems
[22:33:16] <technomancy> for a package manager to work well, it either needs an enormous amount of effort (apt) or to be content-addressable.
[22:34:13] <nmz> yes, I also suggested to this person to just use github worktrees with overloading require
[22:34:28] <technomancy> I try to avoid github as much as I can
[22:34:32] <nmz> git*
[22:35:01] <technomancy> anyway as usual Joe Armstrong has the right idea about this https://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-May/058768.html
[22:35:33] <technomancy> I don't think I'm smart enough to pull it off myself (at the same time as developing a compiler anyway)
[22:36:14] <technomancy> but if you're on telegram you should send that link to that person =)
[22:36:38] <nmz> I think... the bigger the table the longer it takes to fetch no?
[22:37:12] <nmz> in this case, _G would have thousands of items
[22:38:43] <technomancy> yeah, I think for practical purposes in Lua that function granularity is not the way to go with this; module granularity is much easier to implement
[22:39:00] <technomancy> but you could do it on _G with lazy-loading maybe? haven't thought it all the way thru
[22:39:22] <technomancy> package.searchers seems like a natural way to accomplish this

[22:57:42] <technomancy> lmao
[22:57:44] <technomancy> oh well
[22:57:53] <nmz> I think its overcomplicated, you just need, on the lua side, to overload require, externally you need git and worktrees and have a clean repository which contains versions, so you can require a specific one.
[22:58:01] <nmz> externally you need to download and maybe build
[22:58:33] <nmz> the building part to me is magic, I do not know how to handle that part
[22:58:54] <ubq323> hm, you could make the argument to require() be a url of a git repo
