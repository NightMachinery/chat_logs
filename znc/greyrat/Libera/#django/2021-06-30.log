[00:07:59] <mihael> So I have a different User type(proxy models). Upon registration, is it best to check what role the user is in the view and have a different serializer for creating each user type? Or, have one serializer which would handle different user type registration/creation? It's for an API/DRF

[03:56:20] <PaulWay[w]> SQLAlchemy to me looks like too much work.
[03:56:22] <FunkyBob> there was another to infer alchemy table models from django models

[04:38:32] <schinckel> Fish-Face: Which database are you using? I've had a bunch of luck either converting the related data to JSON, or using an implicit composite type (postgres creates one of these for each table).
[04:39:17] <Fish-Face> hmm? postgres, but I'm not sure what an implicit composite type is or how that helps me - since I believe my issue is solved anyhow :P
[04:39:57] <schinckel> Postgres creates a type for each table - you can teach psycopg2 to use a django model when it detects one of these, but it's a bit simpler to use JSONB[].
[04:40:11] <FunkyBob> oh neat

[04:40:58] <schinckel> FunkyBob: That's the stuff I was working on last Friday night. Nicer to use explicit model migrations rather than implicitly creating types when we detect they don't exist.
[04:41:09] <FunkyBob> mmm
[04:41:14] <schinckel> Oh, the composite stuff is the stuff I was working on - the JSONB stuff is much older.

[08:24:32] <b-rex> PaulWay[w]: i remixed it just now
[08:24:58] <PaulWay[w]> Ah, beautiful.

[08:30:57] <b-rex> cool. i have turntables but barely touch them
[08:31:22] <PaulWay[w]> I use MixMeister.  It is superior :-)
[08:31:24] <b-rex> stuck in django world by day, and i have been wanting to make songs more than play them recently
[08:31:51] <PaulWay[w]> Although have to say the current version is a bit of a dog compared to the old version 5.
[08:32:11] <b-rex> do you use a hw turntable thing?
[08:32:59] <b-rex> or is this strictly a software thing?
[08:33:09] <PaulWay[w]> Fully software.
[08:33:24] <b-rex> oh interesting. why didn't i know about this all these years i have been making dnb mixes in audacity lol
[08:33:28] <PaulWay[w]> Basically each track has an intro segment and an outro segment.
[08:33:41] <PaulWay[w]> My dude.  Shiznax has blessed you today.
[08:33:45] <b-rex> hell yeah
[08:34:08] <b-rex> donno if i could use this now because i've become a professional audacity beat matcher
[08:34:11] <PaulWay[w]> Mixmeister locks those together, then seamlessly changes the speed of each track without affecting the pitch so the beats line up.

[08:54:29] <PaulWay[w]> Are they really different types?  With different properties?  Or are they differing roles attached to a user?

[10:48:05] <Kim^J> Javascript?
[10:48:36] <PaulWay[w]> Why would you select the current user at all?
[10:48:44] <PaulWay[w]> If that's the one that this form knows is logged in...
[10:49:10] <wallbroken> ...
[10:49:33] <wallbroken> terminated_user = models.ManyToManyField('auth.User', related_name='terminated_items', blank=True)
[10:49:35] <wallbroken> this is the field
[10:49:38] <wallbroken> ok?
[10:50:07] <wallbroken> terminated_user means that that specific user wants to abort the order
[10:50:18] <wallbroken> so, it's not automatic
[10:50:22] <wallbroken> it's an action by the user
[10:50:46] <wallbroken> that when flags a checkbox and clicks on "submit" the order is aborted
[10:50:52] <wallbroken> now it's clear?
[10:50:55] <wallbroken> i hope so
[10:52:30] <PaulWay[w]> No, not really - what is an order?
[10:53:02] <wallbroken> an order is an item that an user wants to get
[10:53:09] <PaulWay[w]> A single item?
[10:53:20] <PaulWay[w]> You don't have multiple items in an order?
[10:53:23] <wallbroken> yes
[10:53:30] <wallbroken> no, i't managed per item
[10:53:40] <wallbroken> there is not a cumulative order
[10:53:47] <PaulWay[w]> That sounds like a complicated way to think of it.
[10:53:55] <PaulWay[w]> And I think your users aren't going to think of it that way.
[10:53:57] <wallbroken> but taking back to my question
[10:54:03] <wallbroken> how to do what i want to do?
[10:54:15] <PaulWay[w]> Your users are going to think of placing an order for one or more shoes.
[10:54:19] <wallbroken> PaulWay[w]: i'm not here to discuss about how i designed my product
[10:54:24] <PaulWay[w]> (One or more pairs, presumably).
[10:54:37] <PaulWay[w]> What a pity.  That's why you have your problems :-)
[10:55:22] <wallbroken> so, going back to my initial question:
[10:55:42] <wallbroken> do you know a way to select the current user from m2m when i flag the checkbox?
[10:56:16] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.
[10:56:32] <wallbroken> and would you help me in implementing it?
[10:56:36] <PaulWay[w]> Why?

[10:58:45] <PaulWay[w]> Why would I help you in implementing it?
[10:59:00] <Kim^J> wallbroken: If the checkbox is checked, on the forms .save or the views .post, create a new terminated_items thingie and set the user.
[10:59:14] <Kim^J> Also, why is that a many-to-many field?
[10:59:46] <PaulWay[w]> It shouldn't even be a field.
[11:00:11] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: I think what you don't understand is that you have fundamentally burned up all of whatever credit you might have had here.
[11:00:24] <PaulWay[w]> You have pissed it away asking bad questions, ignoring advice, and generally wasting people's time.

[11:01:06] <PaulWay[w]> So when you ask for help on something that betrays a larger, more fundamental misunderstanding of your problems, people just cannot be bothered helping you.
[11:01:25] <PaulWay[w]> You can keep asking here all you like, and occasionally - maybe out of pity - people will help you.
[11:01:46] <PaulWay[w]> But you will learn far more - as we have always said - by going and reading and learning for yourself.
[11:02:28] <PaulWay[w]> And until you repay some of that debt of help you have borrowed from us all, we are disinclined to keep on helping.
[11:03:01] <PaulWay[w]> I've watched most of this from the sidelines.  Other people have helped you far more and are thoroughly burned out by it now.
[11:04:29] <Kim^J> wallbroken: Btw, what would selecting multiple users even mean?
[11:04:48] <PaulWay[w]> It means that multiple users have selected that item to buy.
[11:05:11] <Kim^J> Huh?
[11:05:52] <PaulWay[w]> Yes.  It makes no sense.

[12:35:02] <Kim^J> wallbroken: You're on a very straight path to being banned.
[12:35:22] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: change the widgit
[12:35:44] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/widgets/#checkboxselectmultiple
[12:36:26] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i want that the flag would be permanent once the "submit" button has been clicked
[12:37:23] <FunkyBob> "the flag"?
[12:37:35] <FunkyBob> so what you're saying is you want your view to save  the value?
[12:37:41] <FunkyBob> or you want it to save it in a way that can never be un-done?
[12:38:30] <FunkyBob> it's really hard to help you with out understanding the process you're trying to implement
[12:38:52] <FunkyBob> and as we discovered before, any time I ask you to clearly detail the process, you play stupid... and say you have no idea what I mean
[12:38:53] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: let me explain well:
[12:39:40] <wallbroken> there is an m2m field that associates the users with the items
[12:39:53] <wallbroken> one of them is called terminated_user
[12:40:12] <wallbroken> the purpose of this field is let the logged user to tell: well, i want to abort my order.
[12:40:29] <FunkyBob> seems like a very clumsy and error prone schema, but ok
[12:40:34] <wallbroken> so, actually i have a list of users associated on each ordered item
[12:40:44] <wallbroken> and i can select/unselect multiple users
[12:40:51] <wallbroken> then i click "submit" to store
[12:40:53] <wallbroken> well
[12:40:58] <wallbroken> i want to change this
[12:41:15] <serafeim> do you remmeber if `Model.save()` returns anything ?
[12:41:40] <FunkyBob> serafeim: what do the docs say? :)
[12:41:54] <wallbroken> i want a checkbox for each item, and when i check it, it just select the right user in the m2m list, and then, when i click on submit, the changes are saved
[12:42:01] <serafeim> ha ha i'm asking here in case anybody remembers from heart so i'll avoid visiting the docs
[12:42:38] <serafeim> so no it doesn't
[12:42:47] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: this is all a lot of implementation detail [the how]... but no process detail [the why]
[12:43:01] <FunkyBob> we get confused because you're not explaining what you need, you're explaining how you think it needs to be done
[12:43:36] <serafeim> FunkyBob: this is actually called the XY problem https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem
[12:43:40] <Kim^J> It's the solution C to problem B which is the solution to problem A. We want to hear about problem A, not problem B.
[12:43:58] <FunkyBob> serafeim: I'm very well aware of the x-y problem
[12:44:10] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: the user want to know the admin that he doesn't want to proceed with an order
[12:44:11] <wallbroken> ok?
[12:44:16] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: see, you keep saying you want the list of checkboxes
[12:44:16] <serafeim> yes i just wanted to point it out
[12:44:22] <FunkyBob> but then you say something about selecting the right user
[12:44:29] <wallbroken> ues
[12:44:29] <FunkyBob> so ity sounds like you don't want the list of checkboxes at all
[12:44:43] <FunkyBob> you just want to be able to trigger the action for the current user
[12:44:44] <wallbroken> i want a checkbox that is able to select the right user
[12:44:51] <FunkyBob> what is 'the right user'?
[12:45:03] <wallbroken> the user from which i'm logged in
[12:45:08] <FunkyBob> so "the current user"
[12:45:11] <wallbroken> yes
[12:45:11] <FunkyBob> so you don't need to select it
[12:45:15] <FunkyBob> because the server already know
[12:45:16] <FunkyBob> s
[12:45:19] <FunkyBob> as I pointed out hours ago
[12:45:34] <wallbroken> but the server doesn't already know that i want to abort an order
[12:45:44] <wallbroken> it's an action by the user
[12:45:49] <FunkyBob> it will know that when you hit the "abort an order" endpoint
[12:46:06] <jor> add a checkbox to the form, read its value, set the m2m... :/
[12:47:44] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: ok, and can you help me doing this please?
[12:47:53] <wallbroken> i'm trying to do that on my own since days

[12:53:29] <wallbroken> exactly
[12:54:12] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: so you will need a url with the shoe PK in it, route to a view that gets that shoe, and adds request.user to the terminated m2m...

[14:14:37] <FunkyBob> well, dozens
[14:16:10] <FunkyBob> Kim^J: one problem you'll see is wallbroken gets fixated on one solution only... and ignores anything and anyone that may have a different view

[14:21:54] <FunkyBob> yes... submit being the button
[14:21:57] <FunkyBob> so...
[14:22:10] <wallbroken> the idea of a button is "do something"
[14:22:10] <FunkyBob> are you saying you want the user to be able to toggle that on and off until they're ready, THEN press submit?
[14:22:14] <FunkyBob> yes
[14:22:19] <wallbroken> yes
[14:22:27] <FunkyBob> but if ther's only one action... why have the checkbox AND the button?
[14:22:30] <Kim^J> That's how select boxes work...

[14:23:19] <FunkyBob> Kim^J: tempting... but controls for an ICBM instead?
[14:23:20] <Kim^J> This gonna be guuud!
[14:23:22] <wallbroken> "submit" does sends also an email to admin telling hime the aborted orders
[14:23:28] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: so?
[14:23:36] <FunkyBob> that happens in the view
[14:23:40] <FunkyBob> still no need for a checkbox
[14:23:49] <wallbroken> https://github.com/ClaudioViti/lookbook/blob/multi-user/shoes/views.py#L519
[14:23:55] <Kim^J> I still don't understand why you don't have actual Product and Order models...
[14:23:56] <wallbroken> see this function
[14:24:05] <wallbroken> this is triggered by "submit" button
[14:24:20] <FunkyBob> uh-huh
[14:24:29] <FunkyBob> it's not possible for a related user record to not exist...
[14:24:36] <FunkyBob> but anyway
[14:24:41] <FunkyBob> what has this to do with what we're doing?
[14:24:43] <Kim^J> wallbroken: You're aware that for each new "termination", you'll get every previously "terminated" "orders"?
[14:24:55] <Kim^J> So the list just becomes longer and longer...
[14:25:17] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i want to send an email when the user decided which items to abort
[14:25:33] <wallbroken> and he does that in the moment "submit" is pressed
[14:25:36] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: remember when I asked you to describe the whole process?  yeah... this is whyh
[14:25:55] <FunkyBob> so we've spent all this time guiding you to do what you asked for... but it turns out it's not what you want
[14:26:04] <Kim^J> wallbroken: Will every user see the entire list of users? What prevents someone from cancelling others orders?
[14:26:30] <wallbroken> no, every user doesn't see the entire list of users
[14:32:36] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: so, what's the solution in my case?
[14:32:57] <wallbroken> well, i don't care to keep the checkbox state when loading the order list
[14:33:01] <Kim^J> wallbroken: Demanding a solution, please, just pay someone for that.
[14:33:30] <wallbroken> when loading the page, all the items should have a blank checkbox
[14:33:53] <wallbroken> then the user flags the items to abort, and send "submit"
[14:36:08] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: no, I'm not interested in helping you... you keep making the same mistakes, then acting innocent when you call you on your bullshit
[14:36:23] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: explain UP FRONT the design, the workflow.... before writing any code
[14:36:49] <FunkyBob> all this bullshit about emailing people after whatever.... we would have done things differently IF YOU HAD SAID IT NEEDED DOING
[14:37:53] <FunkyBob> don't get upset when what you get given is what you asked for, not what you wanted
[14:40:00] <wallbroken> sending the email is the way to alert the admin about some changed order
[14:40:05] <wallbroken> what's bad with that?
[14:40:09] <FunkyBob> nothing
[14:40:13] <FunkyBob> but you never mentioned it
[14:40:20] <FunkyBob> until AFTER
[14:40:29] <wallbroken> because is not included in the problem i asked about
[14:40:38] <wallbroken> sedning the email is an unrelated opoint
[14:40:42] <wallbroken> i already developed it
[14:40:45] <FunkyBob> but you seem to feel it's heavily related

[14:41:06] <FunkyBob> despite there being no need for it
[14:41:21] <wallbroken> i just asked a way of when checking the the checkbox and clicking "submit" the change has been made
[14:41:36] <Kim^J> wallbroken: You're aware that there are a shittonne of e-commerce systems out there? Ready to be used.
[14:41:45] <FunkyBob> yeah, this isn't that, Kim^J
[14:42:09] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you already know how to do that.. but that, again, is NOT what you said you needed
[14:42:12] <FunkyBob> and again
[14:42:29] <FunkyBob> we tried to get you to separate your solution from your problem
[14:42:46] <FunkyBob> you said you needed to mark the shoe order terminated
[14:42:50] <FunkyBob> fine... press the button, it's done
[14:43:10] <FunkyBob> and we got all that done... then you insisted you needed the checkbox
[14:43:14] <FunkyBob> which has no function
[14:43:16] <Kim^J> This would be a lot easier if there were actual orders...
[14:43:37] <FunkyBob> this would be a lot easier if wallbroken would to the tutorial and understand the basics
[14:43:38] <Kim^J> Then you could do /orders/<int:pk>/cancel
[14:43:38] <Kim^J> xD
[14:44:11] <Kim^J> (Or POST /orders/<int:pk> with state=cancelled or similar)
[14:44:13] <Kim^J> FunkyBob: That too.
[14:44:22] <FunkyBob> I specifically asked if this was for cancelling a single shoe, or a set of shoes, or all shoes
[14:45:14] <FunkyBob> and if you think you're confused... imagine what it's like for us... trying to guess at what you need because you won't clarify

[15:16:23] <hemebond> (this isn't Django btw, regular HTML functionality)
[15:17:59] <wallbroken> because i want them to be executed only if i click on "submit" button

[15:19:14] <hemebond> What you would have to do is, 1. Have separate forms for each URL, or 2. Use Javascript to handle the behaviour.
[15:20:04] <hemebond> or 3. Submit to a standard URL and return a redirect based on the checkbox value
[15:21:31] <wallbroken> i also tried with "button"
[15:21:37] <wallbroken> as you see in the code
[15:21:40] <wallbroken> but isn't working
[15:21:41] <hemebond> Yeah, it's not supported by HTML.
[15:21:53] <hemebond> That's not how HTML forms work.
[15:22:40] <hemebond> Looking at the code, you want to handle this with Javascript then? btw, this isn't related to Django.
[15:23:48] <wallbroken> yes
[15:25:07] <hemebond> You would be better off writing a simplified version of the form/code and requesting help in an HTML/Javascript channel

[15:49:09] <wallbroken> i'm an user who have in order 4 items
[15:49:23] <wallbroken> today i decided that i want to abort the order of two of them

[15:49:32] <FunkyBob> ah, finally... a user story!  this is progress
[15:49:50] <FunkyBob> go on

[15:50:11] <wallbroken> what does "submit" do?
[15:50:40] <FunkyBob> see, before I asked if this was for one item, many items, or all items... and you said one
[15:50:45] <wallbroken> removes the two items with checkbox flagged, and THEN send the admin an email listing the operation
[15:50:59] <wallbroken> now it's straightforward?
[15:51:00] <wallbroken> i hope so
[15:51:33] <FunkyBob> sure, it makes sense... and is quite easy... and is explcitly NOT what you agreed to before
[15:52:51] <FunkyBob> so present a form for the ordered items field, using the multi checkbox widget... and use the validated result for add()

[18:45:32] <mihael> I have different user types: https://dpaste.org/KNJr Which is a better approach? Create a serializer for each type then check which role the user is in the view and invoke the corresponding serializer? or create one serializer and check the role inside the save/update?
[18:46:46] <jor> mbryant: well, .get_object method is equivalent to a get_object_or_404. You could catch the Http404 exception and e.g. handle None in the template
[18:54:42] *** Joins: PantelicGR (~PantelicG@user/pantelicgr)
[18:55:19] <mbryant> Found it, the generic date views have an "allow_empty" mixin -- set that to True and it allows template to load without data rather than drop a 404

[21:08:19] <wallbroken> and he wants to cancel the order of 2 items
[21:08:53] <wallbroken> i want that he can select with a checkbox the items which wants to cancel, and then to take effective the change, click "submit" button

[21:10:50] <GinFuyou> That sounds weird, since it's already a widget for _selected_ items
[21:11:19] <wallbroken> wait, but the current user must not need to select in a list of users
[21:11:29] <wallbroken> it should know nothing about the other user
[21:11:43] <wallbroken> i want just a checkbox that selects the current user
[21:12:54] <wallbroken> GinFuyou: somebody told me "so present a form for the ordered items field, using the multi checkbox widget... and use the validated result for add()"
[21:13:06] <GinFuyou> Ah, so items are the list, not the multiselect
[21:13:44] <wallbroken> yes, items are those two element with the ID 10 and 11 in that image
[21:14:45] <GinFuyou> So what is the problem then?

[21:16:15] <wallbroken> GinFuyou: and i'm asking for help about it
[21:17:19] <najtsirk> Hi, working with DRF and session authentication and I need an opinion. When a user is not logged in DRF returns 403 because session authentication cannot be handled automatically by client/
[21:17:53] <najtsirk> But I am thinking that it would be nice to know that somebody is not logged in and return 401, end when it is logged in and does not have a permission 403.
[21:17:58] <GinFuyou> You add a field to a form. Then add code in view to process it.
[21:18:39] <najtsirk> So the question is: Should I violate the RFC and use 401 with WWW-Authenticate Session for example or should i stick to 403 response?

[21:54:51] <wallbroken> i'm an user who have in order 4 items
[21:54:57] <wallbroken> today i decided that i want to abort the order of two of them
[21:55:03] <wallbroken> then, whad i do?
[21:55:09] <wallbroken> i open the orders tab
[21:55:16] <wallbroken> and i see 4 items, check the two checkboxes of the two item i want to abort the order and THEN i click "submit" button
[21:55:24] <wallbroken> what does "submit" do?
[21:55:30] <wallbroken> removes the two items with checkbox flagged, and THEN send the admin an email listing the operation
[21:55:36] <wallbroken> the email part has already been done
[21:55:49] <wallbroken> now i'm asking to you how to implement the checkbox
[21:56:01] <GinFuyou> So requirement changed back to a list of checkboxes
[21:56:15] <wallbroken> a checkbox per item
[21:56:17] <wallbroken> yes
[21:56:31] <wallbroken> GinFuyou: please, answer to me: it's clear what my goal is?

[22:12:24] <wallbroken> GinFuyou: from the last explain
[22:12:29] <wallbroken> is clear what my intent is?
[22:12:36] <wallbroken> see the image i posted
[22:12:38] <GinFuyou> probably
[22:12:43] <wallbroken> instead of each list
[22:12:58] <wallbroken> i want a checkbox that acts like i select the current user from the list

[22:14:08] <wallbroken> GinFuyou: what the problem?
[22:14:10] <wallbroken> is so simple
[22:14:11] <GinFuyou> Anyway, form with a boolean field
