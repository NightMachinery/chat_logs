[01:46:40] <juggs> MetaNova, just a quick follow up from yesterday's discussion about expired certs....  Sorted it. Removed DST_Root_CA_X3 from my ZNC server ca-certificate store. Why znc (or openssl) was ignoring the ISRG_Root_X1 cert I have no idea as that was already in the store.

[01:47:32] <juggs> The whole certificate chain thing is like mysterious voodoo to me quite honestly :D
[01:50:32] <MetaNova> juggs: so you basically did the hexchat/mirc fix (removing DST Root Ca X3 from cert.pem and cacert.pem) with ZNC, and that worked?

[03:09:43] <Khaytsus> Linux^: So what's the actual issue?
[03:10:15] <Linux^> I want to run znc when the ubuntu machine turns on automatically 
[03:10:20] <Khaytsus> https://wiki.znc.in/Running_ZNC_as_a_system_daemon
[03:10:29] <Linux^> I have found this https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#How_can_I_restart_ZNC_automatically_.28in_case_of_a_machine_reboot.2C_crash.2C_etc..29.3F
[03:10:31] <Khaytsus> Or just make a simple cronjob...
[03:10:51] <Linux^> " @reboot znc"  
[03:10:53] <Linux^> thats it?
[03:11:30] <MetaNova> Linux^: if you simply want it to start on boot, and continue to try to run, crontab -e ; "* * * * * /usr/local/bin/znc > /dev/null 2>&1"
[03:11:42] <Khaytsus> Personally I prefer */10 * * * * znc
[03:11:46] <MetaNova> ^ better
[03:11:49] <Khaytsus> That way if it crashes for some reason it starts
[03:12:01] <Khaytsus> What MetaNova said ;)
[03:12:08] <Linux^> but wha is it? "/usr/local/bin/znc > /dev/null 2>&1"
[03:12:12] <Khaytsus> what is what
[03:12:14] <MetaNova> the /10 is more reasonable, I mean, for persistence
[03:12:18] <Linux^> that line
[03:12:31] <Khaytsus> the full path to the znc binary?
[03:12:39] <Linux^> that line "/dev/null 2>&1 "
[03:12:47] <juggs> I have....
[03:12:51] <juggs> # m h  dom mon dow   command
[03:12:51] <juggs> */5 * * * *   /usr/local/bin/znc >/dev/null 2>&1
[03:12:52] <Khaytsus> And > /dev/null 2>&1 outputs to null so it doesn't create a bunch of cronjob emails
[03:13:16] <MetaNova> /usr/local/bin/znc (full path, assuming compiled from source) with output ">" directed to /dev/null with error output (2) redirected to stdout (1) which is discarded anway
[03:13:42] <Linux^> so here is my znc installtion directory "$HOME/.local/znc >/dev/null 2>&1 "
[03:13:48] <Linux^> so I do this? ^
[03:14:03] <MetaNova> by default ZNC will check if there is an instance running against a particular conf, and simply not run if detected
[03:14:23] <juggs> Use the full path  /home/username/.local/znc
[03:14:27] <MetaNova> Linux^: if that is your path to ZNC ("$HOME/.local/znc") then yes
[03:14:36] <MetaNova> but I would encourage the full path
[03:14:47] <Linux^> yes I used this command "cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local""
[03:15:03] <Khaytsus> Use the full path as MetaNova but yes
[03:15:10] <Khaytsus> DOn't assume $HOME is what you think it is
[03:15:42] <MetaNova> don't rely on environmental variables (like $HOME) simply working as expected [in conf files]
[03:15:44] <Linux^> what is it? its the current user home?
[03:15:56] <juggs> $HOME is an environment variable and you can't assume it will exist or is the same in the context cron runs. As a rule always use full paths in scripts and automation of anything.
[03:16:05] <MetaNova> ^
[03:16:13] <Linux^> okay :)
[03:16:51] <Linux^> wait but there is no znc folder in "$HOME/.local"

[03:18:02] <Khaytsus> noircode: How do you "detach" irssi from znc?  just exit?
[03:18:04] <MetaNova> noircode: you mean, detach your client (irssi) from ZNC?
[03:18:11] <MetaNova> /quit
[03:19:03] <noircode> ok, my question is confusing. I tried /detach before, but to my client it's an unknown command
[03:19:06] <Linux^> there is 2 folders there znc and   znc-buildmod < 2 binary my bad
[03:19:20] <Linux^> I think its this folder
[03:19:41] <MetaNova> noircode: if you are attempting to make ZNC detach channels, as in, not show them to your client (but remain in them, and continue to buffer their activity) then /msg *status help
[03:19:53] <MetaNova> because you'd want, eg /msg *status detach #chan
[03:20:29] <MetaNova> you could then make them re-appear (and display whatever buffer they had) with /join #chan
[03:21:35] <noircode> ok, so after I /msg *status detach #chan I can quit my client?
[03:21:55] <MetaNova> ... if you're simply looking to detach your client, just close your client
[03:22:08] <noircode> oh
[03:22:09] <MetaNova> you don't need to do anything special before you /exit or /quit
[03:22:13] <Khaytsus> noircode: I think you're way overcomplicating it yes.
[03:22:24] <MetaNova> (besides making sure *chansaver is loaded)
[03:22:25] <Khaytsus> Unless you part a channel, znc stays in that channel
[03:22:29] <MetaNova> ^
[03:22:51] <noircode> ok, ty
[03:22:57] <MetaNova> ZNC attempts to remain in any channels you /join unless it is told to /part them (or fails to rejoin after x attempts)
[03:23:35] <noircode> ZNC is very interesting
[03:23:41] <MetaNova> only if you use a client which (aggravatingly) sends separate /part commands to each channel on /disconnect (like pidgin) do you have to worry
