[00:01:40] <kurahaupo> That's an anachronistic viewpoint
[00:01:58] <FreeBDSM> are cycles still as precious as back then?
[00:02:06] <twkm> i wonder if anything you have designed won't be complained about in 40 years.
[00:02:09] <kurahaupo> put yourself in their shoes: why return extra info that nobody wants?
[00:02:10] <FreeBDSM> did they know of Moore's law back then?
[00:02:17] <phogg> FreeBDSM: this falls in to the category of "it's too late now"
[00:02:28] <kurahaupo> FreeBDSM: Not yet
[00:02:47] <FreeBDSM> phogg: and was too early back then, lol.
[00:02:58] <kurahaupo> Moore's Law had only been running about 10 years at that point
[00:02:59] <twkm> anyway, if you want a redesigned pipeline wander off to powershell.
[00:03:06] <phogg> FreeBDSM: at the time it was a good choice. Today it might not be a good choice, but breaking compatibility would be a bad choice.
[00:03:18] <FreeBDSM> twkm: isn't powershell windoze only?
[00:03:19] <twkm> you can return or pipe structured things.
[00:03:21] <twkm> nope.
[00:03:32] <kurahaupo> You can still emit additional info to stdout
[00:04:07] <phogg> FreeBDSM: I have given this some thought and I don't believe there's another sensible answer even if you were to throw compatibility out the window.
[00:04:17] <FreeBDSM> phogg: a trap of "ha, now you are stuck with legacy!" from the past
[00:04:22] <phogg> but feel free to run your own experiments

[00:05:34] <phogg> FreeBDSM: it is a well known truism that "past you is a jerk"
[00:05:58] <kurahaupo> FreeBDSM: What's wrong with simply outputting the extra info to stdout or stderr?
[00:06:17] <kurahaupo> Or even writing it to an extra provided fd
[00:06:34] <kurahaupo> You don't have to hack the exit syscall

[22:13:35] <twkm> quoting it prevents any glob characters from being used -- when quoted they become plain characters.
[22:14:14] <ciphrCat> twkm: such as if the value contains a '*'?
[22:14:21] <emanuele6> in that specific case ( [[ $line == *#* ]] ) quotes just don't matter at all 
[22:14:24] <twkm> yes.
[22:14:34] <emanuele6> no, that only matters for the rhs
[22:14:58] <emanuele6> [[ $this_doesnt_need_quotes == "$this_needs_quotes" ]]

[22:17:38] <ciphrCat> so expansion of vars with spaces differs between [ and [[.  that sucks.  So to write portable code, you should favor [ when possible, but then you must remember to use quotes

[22:18:41] <ciphrCat> i've seen [[ in ksh

[22:19:05] <emanuele6> ciphrCat: yes, but that may have a different behaviour from bash
[22:19:46] <emanuele6> if you want portability, you should just strictly posix compliant scripts
[22:19:51] <ciphrCat> right.  I should favor [ when possible, for portability.  And if a script is ported, the [[ will highlight the code that needs adaptation

[22:29:43] <emanuele6> oh, you meant "command" :p
[22:30:28] <twkm> verbose will show comments (and commands) as written, while xtrace won't show comments but will show expanded commands.
