[01:57:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "How can we sort colours so that they look as continuous as possible? Which parameters affects the sorting order? Is azure closer to blue (similar hue) or to cyan (similar luminosity)? I can stop you all here and say that there is no solution to this problem. You can sort colours, but the overall result depends on what you are trying to achieve." ... yes. That is the answer. There is no solution because the question assumes
[01:57:05] <Obormot\Arcturus>  one dimension of variation, when in fact there are three. The end.
[01:58:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not an "incredibly challenging" task, it's a task that is either impossible (if incorrectly specified) or trivial (if correctly specified).

[08:11:53] <gwern> like, the simpsons or family guy or futurama or really any other cartoon comedy would've done this joke so much better
[08:13:18] <saturn2> seems like a nerve has been struck
[08:14:55] <gwern> I think that's why 'and it's gone' works, and the rest of it is just completely omitted, because the rest of it is shite, and your mind fills in a much funnier scenario around "aaaaand it's gone" (even your mental vocal delivery is way better than the actual clip where it's just an angry abrupt monotone)
[08:16:19] <gwern> (everytime I've watched anything from southpark over the 20 years, I'm struck by just how consistently deliberately shitty it is. it really drives home what a difference in esthetics and humor there can be. people frigging love south park, but I can't see anything redeeming in it, not when I was a little kid, not when I was a teen, not when I was in college, not now that I'm an adult)
[08:19:51] <ivan> yes, south park is actually very bad
[08:21:08] <ivan> vgr likes it because he's some kind of gen x'er who can't cut the cord on tv propaganda
[08:22:05] <adiabatic> Sounds close to SNL. Generally shit, but the hits are great?
[08:22:33] <adiabatic> maybe it's considered great because there's still an underserved market for, well, South Park Republicans
[08:22:35] <gwern> I don't think south park has any 'hits' in that sense

[14:47:19] <Gurkenglas> when i load https://superuser.com/questions/1539344/how-to-enable-view-source-in-process-monitor i see stickys for about a second
[14:47:19] <Robomot> windows - How to enable "View Source" in Process Monitor? - Super User (Sysinternals Process Monitor has a button to "view the source" on a Event Properties > Stack element: ‚Ä¶)
[14:47:38] <saturn2> AKS doesn't run before the page is fully loaded
[14:47:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Yes, it runs when the page is loaded, and THEN starts watching for additional, subsequently spawned, stickies
[14:48:04] <saturn2> in theory, it could
[14:48:20] <Obormot\Gaia> Gurkenglas: You can see the timing for this if you open your JS console, and watch for the "CONSTANT VIGILANCE" message
[14:48:36] <Gurkenglas> "aren't expecting their DOM elements to vanish" <- could one make them invisible/intangible instead?
[14:48:42] <Obormot\Gaia> And yes, in theory, it could start CONSTANT VIGILANCE immediately, and skip the single run-through on load
[14:48:48] <Obormot\Gaia> But that would be horribly inefficient
[14:48:59] <Obormot\Gaia> And would add no useful functionality
[14:49:20] <Gurkenglas> because it would have to traverse all the things it previously didn't kill for every element as it is added?
[14:49:31] <Obormot\Gaia> Something like that
[14:49:37] <Obormot\Gaia> As for "could one make them invisible/intangible instead" - yes, that's on my list to implement as an option
[14:50:19] <Gurkenglas> (i suppose it might have the drawback that other things don't expand to fill up the space)
[14:51:08] <saturn2> there's no reason it has to be horribly inefficient
[14:54:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: No, it would not have that drawback
[14:55:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well, killing everything via mutation observers is slower than traversing the DOM once and killing everything... I don't know if it "has to" be that way in some ideal sense, but...
[14:57:35] <saturn2> it could save its place in the dom, wait for the next frame, and see if any elements have appeared after the saved one

[14:58:10] <|dbotdan> dawn (@dawnblog, 2021-09-03 00:40): ‚Äòthis is horrifying‚Äô Watch video: https://nitter.mailstation.de/dawnblog/status/1433590801930629121
[14:59:21] <saturn2> but like i said, more complicated
[14:59:22] <Gurkenglas> uBlock origin does it before full page load, right?
[15:00:47] <saturn2> ivan: i have no context for understanding this
[15:03:33] <ivan> saturn2: I think it's minimalism and preferences arising from systematicity which is why OP is 'horrified'
[15:04:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: uBlock origin operates on specified selectors, it doesn't have to check literally every element to inspect its computed CSS properties
[15:04:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: As for "save its place in the DOM", how would that deal with the DOM being subsequently modified/rearranged/etc.
[15:05:57] <Gurkenglas> does the mutation listener not hand you a diff?
[15:07:48] <saturn2> it wouldn't, and it also would get fooled by late-loading or injected CSS, you'd have to do another pass to catch those things
[15:08:58] <Gurkenglas> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver does say there's a mutationsList
[15:08:58] <Robomot> MutationObserver - Web APIs | MDN (The MutationObserver interface provides the ability to watch for changes being made to the DOM tree. It is designed as a replacement for the older Mutation Events feature, which was part of the DOM3 Events specification.)
[15:20:25] <Gurkenglas> i'm guessing the restart of the listener on every mutation is so that when it observes 10 small mutations it doesn't traverse the page 10 times
[15:26:51] <Gurkenglas> although before saturn2 put that in it was already only traversing what was mutated - the pause before readding the listener is what requires you to traverse everything these days. What was that "Firefox performance bug"?
[15:32:19] <saturn2> firefox would constantly pop up a warning telling me that AKS was slowing down my browser
[15:33:34] *** Joins: two2thehead (~AVX0@124.195.205.216)
[15:34:07] <saturn2> the key bit is the requestIdleCallback
[15:36:42] <Gurkenglas> what that does is it turns off the listener until one second has passed or the browser is out of other things to do
[15:37:38] *** Quits: two2thehead (~AVX0@124.195.205.216) (Client Quit)
[15:38:01] <saturn2> oh yeah, now i remember
[15:39:24] <saturn2> the firefox bug was that firefox would run the mutationobserver callback for every dom change, it would not queue them up in a list
[15:39:26] <PapuaHardyNet> mst: people I work for use react native. I dunno if it is good or not, but it sure as hell is better than being forced to write iOS or Android specific code
[15:39:41] <Gurkenglas> Ah, I think I see the fix to the problem you patched then :). killSticky(mutation.target) goes through all nodes recursively under target, but target is the node that the mutation happened *to*. You should only check mutation.addedNodes
[15:40:11] <Gurkenglas> aka the added and removed nodes are children of target, and if target is body you traverse the rest of body too, which wasnt changed
[15:41:47] <saturn2> so it was necessary to stop the observer, wait for the main thread to become idle, then look through the whole DOM for sticky elements that may have been added
[15:42:12] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, im pretty sure it's fine to run it every time, you just need to make it not do lots of unnecessary work
[15:42:38] <saturn2> otherwise the obvserver would be called tens of thousands of times, or sometimes in a non-stop continuous loop
[15:43:21] <Gurkenglas> i suppose if something respawns the sticky every time it's killed, that would be a problem regardless of how efficient the killing becomes...

[23:57:42] <gwern> (org-mode isn't even the first emacs one. I've always enjoyed the name of 'The Insidious Big Brother Database')
[23:57:51] <pompolic> :D
[23:58:12] <gwern> shawwwn: I think it has to be a weird svg thing for proper dark mode inversion... or something
[23:58:13] <adiabatic> and I thought calling my notes on people "Personal Echelon" was edgy
[23:58:36] <gwern> adiabatic: that's not edgy because only old as dirt people even remember what an echelon is or why it was appalling
[23:58:43] <adiabatic> hah
[23:59:47] <gwern> shawwwn: hm. 'gwern logo' doesn't work quite as well as I expected in google although the 5th hit is https://www.gwern.net/static/img/logo/ which of course works perfectly
