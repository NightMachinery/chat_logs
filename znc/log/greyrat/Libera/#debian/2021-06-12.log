[00:01:42] <antto> so there's "root" with password, and also a user with password and "sudo" rights, and now i added a ssh key thing to that user and now i can log in from here as the user without a password

[00:05:41] <Mathisen> you probably thinking about ubuntu, they dont have a root pass set as default just so people dont go and use root for everything. but root is still there
[00:05:57] <Mathisen> in any case you dont need to remove root user.

[10:25:28] <velix> My god. journald is just plain rubbish... It's really really bad. Why can _any_ user run `journalctl` and even list secrets logged by some applications? Is this a Debian feature?
[10:26:05] <velix> That's a destater of privacy and data protection.
[10:29:24] <catbeard> don't give them access to run journalctl?
[10:29:45] <velix> catbeard: Sure... but since when is Debian "access all areas" OS ?
[10:30:07] <velix> Why not allow root ssh by default?
[10:30:19] <catbeard> it is allowed by default
[10:30:24] <velix> nope

[10:30:47] <catbeard> oh well carry on

[10:33:28] <velix> Hold systemd? 
[10:33:30] <catbeard> so it won't update

[10:34:28] <catbeard> works
[10:34:59] <catbeard> or just restrict .ssh/authorized_keys to non-interactive sessions, and use the commands="" attribute to specify commands they can run

[10:35:45] <velix> Oh well, again: broken by design ;)
[10:36:09] <velix> catbeard: It's way easier to deny "bad" commands then figure out, white might be allowed and what not.
[10:36:24] <catbeard> easier yes, more secure no
[10:37:18] <velix> Also true for journaldctl: allowing all areas access to journalctl is easy, but not secure ;)
[10:37:49] <catbeard> you could just syslog to remote only
[10:37:59] <catbeard> so journalctl can't pull local logs
[10:38:26] <catbeard> if they're not configured to log, there's nothing to pull
[10:38:29] <velix> catbeard: I'm already using journald as a buffer only. Journald is a very bad design, since you can't remove logs. You can only rotate or drop them all.
[10:38:45] <velix> The data is in there for minutes only and handled by rsyslog.
[10:39:01] <velix> Debian's apporach to a persistent log is bad bad bad.
[10:39:02] <catbeard> yeah there's also this annoying log throttling when journald thinks you're logging to fast
[10:39:12] <velix> catbeard: I've benchmarked this of course.
[10:39:22] <velix> 4000 logs in 5 seconds is still fine.

[10:39:48] <catbeard> yeah i'm talking .5-1M lines/sec
[10:39:51] <velix> ;)
[10:40:09] <velix> I think, rsyslog will puke then, too.
[10:40:23] <catbeard> depends on what you log (log conditions) like nginx
[10:40:28] <velix> rsyslog's module to read from journald's log is bad.
[10:40:36] <catbeard> yeah
[10:40:52] <catbeard> if you just log crits to syslog
[10:40:55] <catbeard> then that's cool
[10:41:41] <catbeard> but write access logs with smol buffer and stream it to remote syslog, don't make rsyslog depend on journald
[10:41:46] <velix> My fear is rather that some program or container throws something into the logfile that nobody should see. If all users can then record `journalctl` without restrictions, this is not a desirable state on a multi-user system.
[10:42:15] <velix> catbeard: My problem is that some container stuff is writing their ID in journald variables.
[10:42:21] <velix> catbeard: Those variables don't make it into syslog.
[10:42:41] <velix> catbeard: I've started to patch journald on this. But it's not that wasy.
[10:42:44] <velix> easy*
[10:42:59] <catbeard> it ain't easy being wheezy
[10:43:12] <velix> catbeard: In the function, journald creates the syslog output, you don't have access to the variables...
[10:43:19] <velix> So I need to get the variables imported in the function somehow.
[10:43:32] <velix> But it's offtopic here and will never make it upstream
[10:43:35] <catbeard> fail2ban incremental import?
[10:43:42] <catbeard> with custom groks
[10:44:29] <catbeard> just gotta find a way to disable journald and log only to files
[10:44:37] <catbeard> or remote tcp endpoints
[10:46:31] <velix> catbeard: I think the approach to disallow "x" for users not in the group xy is fine.
[10:47:05] <catbeard> ya or that
[10:47:10] <velix> Users don't have access to /var/log/journal/*.journal
[10:47:24] <catbeard> but journalctl does
[10:47:34] <velix> yes. since it runs at root.

[10:50:24] <velix> Really sad this isn't default. Maybe they simply forgot it.
[10:50:42] <velix> Standard answer on systemd mailinglist: "we're aware of it, but this is on our todo list".
[10:51:05] <catbeard> like how long do it take to write an apt trigger to chown/chmod to root/sudoers
[10:51:24] <velix> catbeard: My problem is that most admins might not be aware of it.
[10:51:41] <catbeard> i mean if you're using journalctl at all, you're probably going to _be_ root
[10:51:47] <PMT> I'm legitimately surprised the answer on systemd lists is not "no real engineers care about security any more"
[10:51:52] <catbeard> or do somehting that requires sudo
[10:52:16] <velix> catbeard: Ah good idea. I could move /usr/bin/journalctl to sudo group.
[10:52:31] <velix> The guys who're into sudo have access to it anyway ;)

[10:53:05] <velix> I really thing of throwing my users in a container... so that they don't get in touch with the real system at all
[10:53:09] <velix> think*
[10:53:17] <catbeard> yeah you could chroot
[10:53:23] <catbeard> but that's a _pain_
[10:53:30] <velix> chroot isn't isolated enough. I had that in the past.
[10:53:32] <velix> or just a VM... 
[10:53:39] <catbeard> LXD/LXC
[10:53:43] <catbeard> maybe
[10:53:57] <velix> LXD/LXC still has the same issue: the daemon is running root. Only podman solves this.
[10:53:58] <PMT> I would do VM. But do whatever works for you.
[10:54:11] <velix> I think, blocking access to journalctl works best.
[10:54:23] <velix> Hehe, I have access to some Debian systems. Let's see if I can see its logs.
[10:54:27] <velix> 1 sec
[10:54:57] <velix> Yes, looool. I can read the logs on a University's system, where I don't have sudo rights.

[11:26:55] <FuriousGeorge> pmt sure
[11:27:34] <themill> ./foo is running foo as a separate command; . ./foo is sourcing it into the current shell

[11:29:24] <FuriousGeorge> source, i see
[11:30:17] <TJ-> velix: looking at systemd source-code it could be due to whether or not systemd is built with suppotr for ACLs (HAVE_ACL) which you can check with "systemd --version" and look for "+ACL" - if so, then an ACP may be allowing it

[11:32:10] <TJ-> velix: with +ACL it then checks permissions/ACLs on /run/log/journal and if that doesn't exist /var/log/journal
[11:32:54] <PMT> And without, what, it just gives everyone sudo access and says "good luck"? :P
[11:33:42] <TJ-> no, the other way around, without permissions it reports "Hint: You are currently not seeing messages from other users and the system..."

[11:34:04] <FuriousGeorge> foo is in my path
[11:34:25] <FuriousGeorge> PMT:  foo is in my path so the fact that there's a directory called foo is just coincidence
[11:34:32] <FuriousGeorge> maybe?
[11:34:37] <PMT> FuriousGeorge: but...you ran ./foo, you said
[11:34:43] <FuriousGeorge> right, i did
[11:34:48] <FuriousGeorge> that's why i said maybe
[11:34:52] <TJ-> FuriousGeorge: ". ./<somefile>" *sources* the script not executes it
[11:35:12] <PMT> TJ-: the reason I find this confusing is that they report foo is a directory.
[11:35:15] <FuriousGeorge> right...  but somefile is a directory
[11:35:27] <themill> I think real commands and real output in a pastebin would be helpful
[11:35:50] <TJ-> ahh, I'm in bright sunshine and havng difficulty seeing FuriousGeorge messages because they're lime-green on white! Let me re-read
[11:36:08] <PMT> ==themill
[11:36:36] <FuriousGeorge> im a dummy...  i was off by a line when i copy pasted ls for foo
[11:36:42] <FuriousGeorge> i need glasses
[11:36:48] <FuriousGeorge> foo is a symlink so source foo
[11:36:51] <velix> TJ-: Thanks, I'll keep on digging.
[11:37:16] <FuriousGeorge> symlink to a script obviously
[11:37:20] <PMT> One hopes.
[11:37:39] <PMT> What are the permissions on the script it's symlinked to?
[11:38:25] <FuriousGeorge> PMT:  a-x, hence permission denied
[11:38:30] <TJ-> velix: maybe "namei -l  /run/log/journal /var/log/journal" will help

[12:51:40] <PMT> My first thought would be suggesting you file a bug with Mozilla. My other thought is trying a local CSS override for whichever font it used to use for you.
[12:52:32] <PMT> And when you say they only show Helvetica in the console, do you mean it thinks that's the only usable font installed, or the only font in use?
