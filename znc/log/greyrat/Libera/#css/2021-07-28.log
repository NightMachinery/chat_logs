[00:25:25] <tester12> how can I do this
[00:25:46] <hassoon> tester12: you just change the color of the paret
[00:25:57] <hassoon> * parent
[00:26:25] <paule32> thank you entu
[00:27:53] <entuland> yw, have a look here for one possible approach (the JS handling to toggle the language is just to convey the point) https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/o1zyrfns/
[00:29:17] <entuland> I still believe you shouldn't be doing any of that and you should be serving the page all in german or all in english or whatever without stashing all the languages in a single output
[00:30:05] <hassoon> ideally they should have a select element that offers the user the ability to change the website's language on the go
[00:30:24] <entuland> yep, but that's just the facility to let the user change the language

[00:30:42] <entuland> I have websites like that and they don't only have the output translated, also the URLs
[00:30:45] <hassoon> no need to make it backend
[00:30:56] <tester12> hassoon how? with clor:red for parent all childs get red color
[00:31:18] <entuland> it's not like they _need_ to, indeed, but that's the approach I suggest
[00:31:50] <hassoon> they can just make up a javascript translation functionality/module, that relies on a json file for getting translations
[00:31:54] <tester12> hassoon solved, thanks
[00:32:10] <entuland> tester12, your current question makes no sense, as there is no text to be colored directly inside of "parent", it's all in the children
[00:32:10] <hassoon> tester12: what ?
[00:32:32] <entuland> so _color_ per se wouldn't do anything to parent, would only fall down inherited to the children
[00:32:35] <paule32> yes, i try to modulrize as much so possible
[00:32:50] <tester12> hassoon parent color
[00:32:54] <entuland> now, background or border or the alike, yes, that would make sense, or if there was any text inside of the parent
[00:33:09] <tester12> hassoon I had a mistake

[00:36:28] <tester12> edited
[00:36:35] <entuland> tester12, various ways: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/hwp61ns8/1/
[00:37:15] <entuland> the above is just one, it really depends on your _real_ situation
[00:37:42] *** Parts: wallbroken (wallbroken@user/wallbroken) ()
[00:37:46] <tester12> entuland thanks a lot,good idea, I'll test it
[00:37:47] <entuland> without explicitly or implicitly targeting the children, no, there is no way to avoid inheritance
[00:38:04] <DPA> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all
[00:38:22] <entuland> the alternative is not to trigger inheritance at all, by wrapping what you want to target
[00:40:15] <entuland> this is one way to avoid affecting the descendants: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/hwp61ns8/2
[00:41:05] <entuland> key point there isn't using :not() or anything, it's just targeting something in particular that has no descendants
[00:42:10] <entuland> all the same soup, what really matters is your real markup to decide accordingly: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/hwp61ns8/3/
[00:43:17] <DPA> Careful, that :not() will only exclude one level: https://jsfiddle.net/0rzy2sxt/
[00:44:32] <entuland> yep, that's why I stressed the fact that the actual markup matters to decide
[00:45:07] <entuland> a child selector there would do the trick just fine: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/Lkfyxuz2/
[00:46:51] <entuland> child combinator*
[00:47:49] <entuland> sometimes I wished they picked the two swapped around (space for child combinator, ">" for descendant combinator), but it's too late for such things :P

[03:18:49] <mikrosis> :)
[03:19:04] <mikrosis> anyone here? :)
[03:19:27] <mikrosis> I got an existing page where CSS property `perspective` is set to something - which makes an element inside invisible.
[03:19:29] <mikrosis> https://codepen.io/strarsis/pen/wvdyYge
[03:19:43] <mikrosis> How can I set perspective back to something as there wouldn't have been set any perspective?
[03:19:56] <mikrosis> Because `perspective: initial` or `perspective: none` doesn't help.
[03:20:17] <mikrosis> so not setting a `perspective` at all is different than setting it back to `initial` or `none` for a element inside.

[08:26:02] <Rockwood> at the end of scrolling
[08:26:37] <FunkyBob> so right button when far right, and left when far left?
[08:27:36] <Rockwood> should be variable at it
[08:27:45] <Rockwood> should be visible at it

[08:34:19] <Rockwood> right side button not disabling

[08:38:03] <Rockwood> i think returning nothing from it is the cause
[08:41:36] <FunkyBob> that... is not at all what I meant
[08:41:51] <FunkyBob> check the values it's basing its calculations on
[08:42:02] <FunkyBob> it doesn't return anything... so logging its return values is pointless
[08:42:06] <FunkyBob> read and understand the code!
[08:43:43] <Rockwood> yes
[08:43:46] <Rockwood> i am reading it
[08:44:08] <FunkyBob> but do you understand it?
[08:44:16] <FunkyBob> looks like it's a rounding issue
[08:44:20] <Rockwood> (container.scrollLeft + container.clientWidth ) >= container.scrollWidth  is the cause for error
[08:44:55] <Rockwood> yes you are correct i think
[08:44:56] <FunkyBob> http://jsfiddle.net/xb1aq9t0/
[08:45:11] <FunkyBob> the "cause" of the error is scrollLeft is not an integer...

[14:50:57] <mad_moses> I mean, how to show maximum 4 lines.
[14:51:07] <entuland> mad_moses, you can target elements depending on their ordinal position
[14:51:22] <entuland> check :nth-of-type() and similar pseudo selectors

[14:54:38] <entuland> oh
[14:55:07] <entuland> you could set the height to 4em or the alike, and clip the rest
[14:55:23] <entuland> key point there being the overflow property

[14:55:38] <entuland> as of right now you are setting the height, but the content takes precedence

[14:55:58] <entuland> I don't remember the default, you may need to check or explicitly set it
[14:56:07] <entuland> so that you can set the height exactly to 4 line heights

[14:58:51] <entuland> normal
[14:58:51] <entuland> Depends on the user agent. Desktop browsers (including Firefox) use a default value of roughly 1.2, depending on the element's font-family.
[14:58:51] <mad_moses> okay thank you. I will try this
[14:58:59] <entuland> the above is taken from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height
[14:59:03] <entuland> yw
[14:59:28] <entuland> mikrosis, I definitely can see the difference of behavior between chrome and firefox
[14:59:40] <entuland> but I can't pinpoint why they behave differently
[15:00:09] <entuland> it's probably due to the lack of some other properties, or to some behavior that's not explicitly dictated by the specs
[15:03:31] <mikrosis> entuland: indeed! I need to find out what perspective/transform properties are missing
[15:04:30] <entuland> mikrosis, there may be something also tied to the fact of applying the perspective as a property or as a transform
[15:05:02] <entuland> if I change your line 2 from perspective: to transform: translateZ then the red square pops out in chrome as well
[15:05:49] <entuland> my gut feeling is that they should do pretty much the same thing but there may be some gotcha we're missing there
[15:07:04] <entuland> there is also a perspective() transform

[15:08:07] <mikrosis> entuland: ah, so the perspective property influences the perspective transform
[15:08:15] <mikrosis> they are not equal - they don't override each other
[15:08:16] <mikrosis> hmm right
[15:08:26] <mikrosis> computed styles sadly show now difference in the red square container element
[15:08:31] <mikrosis> *shows
[15:08:59] <entuland> so, perspective is to move the viewer and the Z=0 plane
[15:09:11] <entuland> so that's probably something you want to only set once
[15:09:26] <entuland> then you may want to only use translateZ to move stuff back and forth
[15:10:52] <entuland> the docs aren't very clear but there seems to be a difference between perspective as a property and perspective() as a transform

[15:14:32] <entuland> mikrosis, have a look at this, it seems to explain what's really happening with property vs transform: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/perspective/
[15:14:55] <mikrosis> entuland: adding `transform: translateZ(0)` to the container element fixes the issue - why? I don't know...
[15:15:36] <mikrosis> entuland: https://codepen.io/strarsis/pen/wvdyYge
[15:15:40] <entuland> not sure, it simply seems like some techniques / changes can't rely on just one property

[15:16:37] <entuland> also, I believe that nesting there makes things more complicated
[15:19:56] <mikrosis> entuland: indeed! but in this case I had no control over it - it was added via iframe
[15:20:09] <mikrosis> hence I have to add extra styles to protect the contents from these unintended side-effects
[15:20:42] <entuland> yeah, messing with iframes is always fun times :)

[15:30:28] <entuland> mikrosis, I notice that if you remove perspective on the outer wrapper and you remove the translateZ from the red box, you end up with pretty much the same result
[15:30:44] <entuland> all in all, even your original code seems just to be doing a translate there, as end result
[15:30:58] <entuland> what's the actual purpose of doing that perspective / translateZ thing?
[15:34:21] <mikrosis> entuland: Oh, this is a reproducible minimal test case, actually it is markup/styles from a panorama viewer
[15:34:46] <entuland> okay, so you actually needed to alter the perspective
[15:34:48] <mikrosis> entuland: see this new issue: https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum/issues/1014
[15:35:49] <entuland> I see - hopefully we'll get to find out why chrome and firefox behave differently there
[15:36:23] <entuland> I have memory of some other oddity fixed by explicitly setting translateZ(0) for something in the past
[15:38:05] <entuland> mikrosis, not sure if it relates, but it seems to: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=716524
[15:39:19] <entuland> the bug per se is very old but it's still open and has been updated recently
[15:40:40] <mikrosis> entuland: hehe, I still get mozilla (not chromium, I know, but also a browser) for a page-break bug during printing. Some bugs seem to need quite some time...
[15:41:02] <entuland> aye
