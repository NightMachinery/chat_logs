[00:32:04] <waleee> jmercouris: deep fried lasagna? Someone on the Swedish subreddit was trying it out
[00:33:02] <waleee> tldr don't use a frozen one, the end result for him was "well done" on the outside and lasagna popsicle on the inside
[00:56:39] <lagash> jmercouris: fruits, of course!
[00:58:25] <waleee> the fruit of the day? :P
[00:58:35] * waleee prepares to dub durian the fruit of the day

[13:48:55] <qhong> any good idea for naming movement function and node searching function? I decide to separate them so ppl can use node searching functions directly instead of `save-excursion' everywhere, but now we need to find 2x names
[13:49:36] <qhong> I thought about forward-node and node-forward, but then there's also end-of-subtree that don't have such counterpart
[14:33:52] <pjb> aartaka: com.informatimago.common-lisp.cesarum.ecma048
[14:39:46] <aartaka> pjb: I don't yet see how that could help us parse escape sequences to sensible HTML, but thanks :)
[14:45:57] <pjb> aartaka: no, indeed, it only generates sequences, not parse them.  For parsing I have a hack in emacs, but incomplete.
[14:47:15] <pjb> Note it's relatively simple to parse. sequence := CSI [ param { ';' param } ] code_letter | a_few_control_codes.  CSI := ESC '[' | 8-bit-CSI .
[14:48:24] <aartaka> pjb: Yes, that I understand. Mapping it to HTML requires quite some coding, though :)
[14:48:25] <pjb> The more difficult part is to have a screen model to paint from those commands.
[14:48:36] <aartaka> Exactly (:
[14:50:01] <pjb> If you want to handle cursor movements, you could keep a screen buffer, mutate it, and then dump it into html, perhaps a <pre> with character attributes.
[14:50:18] <qhong> pjb: I currently have a redisplay thing that update DOM in WebKit from a DOM tree in lisp image, but that's probably overkill
[14:51:07] <pjb> You have to choose a specification, you don't have to implement 100% of the functionalities. In general, people are happy with colors, bold underline and blink…
[14:51:15] <qhong> Mutating the lisp DOM using generic function sets some dirty flag, and upon redisplay a sequence of JS is generated to incrementally update the DOM in webkit
[14:51:29] <pjb> And perhaps a few cursor movement.
[14:55:48] <aartaka> pjb: Sounds sane, thanks for pointers :)

[16:32:14] <nij-> Not really a question about nyxt.. but about how nyxt developers use parenscript in development.
[16:33:04] <nij-> Parenscript does translate some idioms in CL (e.g. defun) into JS, but not all. For example, (js (mapcar..)) doesn't got translated correctly, in that mapcar is treated as a user-defined function.
[16:33:32] <nij-> What tricks do nyxt devs do to work-around this?

[18:34:01] <lagash> jmercouris: I'm assuming after a few thousand entries a hash table might be worth considering :P
[18:35:03] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[18:35:51] <aartaka> nij-: Sticking to imperative idioms (as most of those are translatable by Parenscript) and writing simple code are our best practices against Parenscript translation incompleteness. But, I guess, we never actually talked about this. It was an intuitive decision. I suppose that JavaScript down below the parentheses was corrupting us :)
[18:36:34] <lagash> CL good, JS bad
[18:40:25] <lagash> Do the auto-mode-rules ever get COMPILED? Or just parsed and loaded?
[18:41:41] <lagash> Gah if Nyxt just didn't stop on first match...
