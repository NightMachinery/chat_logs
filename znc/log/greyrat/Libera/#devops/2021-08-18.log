[00:28:11] <kwilczynski> Not really a surprise.
[00:28:14] <kwilczynski> And also...
[00:28:20] <kwilczynski> When I run large Kubernetes clusters.
[00:28:36] <kwilczynski> Constant timeouts from Kubelet were a norm.
[00:28:42] <kwilczynski> Mainly due to GC too.
[00:29:12] <kwilczynski> But... bloody zealots never believed me, but... now it's scientifically proven :)

[00:42:52] <rawtaz> i wonder if nomad suffers from the same issues
[00:42:59] <rawtaz> i recall its written in Go too
[00:55:39] <kwilczynski> Yes.
[00:55:43] <kwilczynski> Might as well be.
[00:56:01] <rawtaz> yeah or it may be written better so it isnt as bad
[00:56:12] <kwilczynski> And last time when I worked for a customer that had 60,000+ containers running.
[00:56:14] <rawtaz> and might work differently so its not as bad that way either :)
[00:56:16] <kwilczynski> We had seen small issues.
[00:56:27] <rawtaz> wow, thats a tonload of containers
[00:58:18] <rawtaz> ok im off to the gym

[19:02:10] <kwilczynski> ;p
[19:04:24] <rawtaz> i will!
[19:05:35] <rawtaz> here, this is a schematics over the anatomy of drama llama: https://d.furaffinity.net/art/imadramallama/1319646001/1319646001.imadramallama_drama_llama_anatomy_.jpg
[19:05:50] <rawtaz> (found by searching for "anatomy of drama llama", believe it or not)
[19:10:27] <kwilczynski> Excellent.
[19:10:36] <kwilczynski> Precisely what I needed.
[19:10:38] <kwilczynski> But...
[19:10:42] <kwilczynski> It's black and white.
[19:10:44] <kwilczynski> ;/
[19:11:46] <rawtaz> yeah. it's for kids, you'll have to color it yourself ;)
[19:11:57] <rawtaz> im not sure what else you expected :P
[19:13:09] <kwilczynski> :(
[19:13:12] <rawtaz> lol, i love the "sound bananas" at https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/af/87/d2af873e409de4d3bdcc30c7daa158c1.jpg :D
[19:13:30] <rawtaz> it all makes sense now that they put the right words on them :3
[19:13:34] <kwilczynski> Well, since I am an Millennial.
[19:13:51] <kwilczynski> I expected Llama to be in 24 bit HDR colour.
[19:13:55] <kwilczynski> 4K
[19:13:58] <rawtaz> oooh
[19:13:58] <kwilczynski> Animated.
[19:14:14] <kwilczynski> And interactive.
[19:14:20] <kwilczynski> As an mobile app.
[19:14:23] <kwilczynski> With micropayments.
[19:14:35] <kwilczynski> So I can buy gold to buy my Llama a hat.
[19:14:38] <kwilczynski> Hipster hat.
[19:14:40] <rawtaz> i suppose it also needs the latest 5G vaccine?
[19:14:47] <kwilczynski> No.
[19:14:51] <kwilczynski> I am anti-vaxxer.
[19:14:52] <rawtaz> i hear you dress your llamas well :)
[19:14:52] <kwilczynski> ;]
[19:14:55] <rawtaz> oh ok
[19:15:07] <kwilczynski> Llama always dresses for success.
[19:15:25] <rawtaz> WORD!
[19:15:28] <kwilczynski> No like Alpacas...
[19:15:35] <kwilczynski> These are the worse.
