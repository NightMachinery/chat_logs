[00:01:55] <Roey> this guy is really good, I like all the stuff he puts out
[00:02:02] <Berlin36> can't they implement this guy's animation and stuff
[00:02:06] <Roey> Berlin36: well because they're real-time
[00:02:17] <Roey> and the animations here all took hours to compute
[00:02:23] <Berlin36> oh yeah makes sense
[00:02:26] <Roey> so the games end up making trade-offs

[00:49:55] <Snake`s_Ghost> idk like 12 years
[00:50:00] <Berlin36> wow
[00:50:15] <Berlin36> soo um, do you have some precious advice? :3
[00:50:24] <Snake`s_Ghost> learn java
[00:50:28] <Berlin36> like what should i really -
[00:50:29] <Berlin36> what
[00:50:32] <Berlin36> java?
[00:50:48] <Urchin[emacs]> ugh, java
[00:50:52] <Berlin36> why
[00:50:55] <Berlin36> java
[00:51:15] <Urchin[emacs]> at least learn a functional language on jvm like scala or clojure

[00:53:33] <Snake`s_Ghost> ObakeNoises, do you want to see my anime list?
[00:54:22] <Berlin36> i want to see why java
[00:55:04] <Berlin36> welp
[00:55:09] <Snake`s_Ghost> Berlin36, java has nice features like garbage collection
[00:55:18] <Berlin36> aaaand 
[00:55:18] <Snake`s_Ghost> c++ is prone to bugs
[00:55:26] <ObakeNoises> Snake`s_Ghost: I mean, not really but I'd like to talk with you about this year's anime in a week or so probably
[00:55:29] <Berlin36> what about GO
[00:55:34] <ObakeNoises> Snake`s_Ghost: and if linking a list is easier, then that's fine
[00:55:37] <Berlin36> it has garbage collection too
[00:55:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Berlin36: AFAIK, C++, never
[00:55:55] <Snake`s_Ghost> ObakeNoises, oh ok, but im behind, i just watch random things not on a schedule :V
[00:56:07] <ObakeNoises> Snake`s_Ghost: I'm going to talk to people and make like a priority list of the stuff for the year and try to get some stuff watched in Nov and Dec
[00:56:13] <ObakeNoises> but I'm distracted right now
[00:56:16] <Berlin36> what never
[00:56:41] <Urchin[emacs]> C++ is prone to turning into an overcomplicated mess that drains the programmer's sanity
[00:56:44] <ObakeNoises> Snake`s_Ghost: I'll at least take everyone's opinion about stuff I'm into, but like I'm not gonna watch harem shows if they aren't instant classic tier
[00:56:46] <Urchin[emacs]> seen it happen, wasn't pretty
[00:57:01] <Berlin36> and i don't know what should i do lol
[00:57:01] <Urchin[emacs]> learned to keep the fuck away from C++
[00:57:09] <Berlin36> i've heard that many times
[00:57:16] <Berlin36> what about C?
[00:57:21] <Berlin36> aren't they simillar
[00:57:28] <Snake`s_Ghost> Berlin36, even if you learn and write java you can still learn and write c++ too
[00:57:33] <Snake`s_Ghost> it's not all-or-nothing
[00:57:40] <Snake`s_Ghost> but you will enjoy java for learning
[00:57:57] <Snake`s_Ghost> c++ will be like facedesking all the time
[00:58:16] <Berlin36> won't say it's not true lol
[00:58:22] <Snake`s_Ghost> yeah C is similar to c++, there are also points of similarity between those two and java
[00:58:49] <Berlin36> i enjoy it but at the same time i fee like i haven't learned anyting new for a while because i feel evwrything is so hard and i just c a n ' t
[00:58:51] *** Quits: zoidberg (uid349353@user/saganman) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[00:58:52] <Snake`s_Ghost> C lacks classes so you end up doing ADT using a pointer
[00:59:00] <Berlin36> so
[00:59:06] <Berlin36> java?
[00:59:14] <Snake`s_Ghost> yea that's what i'm doing at uni, its good fun
[00:59:18] <Snake`s_Ghost> also building is easy
[00:59:23] <Berlin36> but what about 
[00:59:24] <Berlin36> golang
[00:59:36] <Snake`s_Ghost> just put all your sauce in one directory and write javac *.java in terminal
[00:59:41] <Snake`s_Ghost> then java YourProgram to run
[00:59:51] <Berlin36> ye cpp is also easy to run
[01:00:02] <Berlin36> g++ file.cpp && ./a.out
[01:00:17] <Snake`s_Ghost> ok
[01:00:45] <Berlin36> what can you do with java?
[01:00:47] <Snake`s_Ghost> Berlin36, personally when it comes to go, i found a strange piece of syntax that just bugged me so i never used it
[01:00:53] <Snake`s_Ghost> golang
[01:01:07] <Berlin36> oh
[01:01:11] <Snake`s_Ghost> i think a function was missing some parens or something idk, just triggered my OCD
[01:01:20] <Snake`s_Ghost> but if you ddont care about that, golang is fun
[01:01:22] <Berlin36> xd
[01:01:51] <Berlin36> you see, i am very interested in cryptography and studd
[01:01:53] <Berlin36> stuff
[01:01:53] <Urchin[emacs]> golang really tries to bring C crowd to 21st century
[01:02:01] <Berlin36> like malware, it just looks fun
[01:02:21] <Snake`s_Ghost> yeah for hacking you're gonna wanna get into C but you can do that later
[01:02:25] <Snake`s_Ghost> good hackers are good programmers too
[01:02:32] <Berlin36> exactly
[01:02:47] <Berlin36> so i just don't know what path should i take
[01:02:51] <Snake`s_Ghost> only cause C is so vulneratble and buggy O_O
[01:02:58] <Berlin36> lol
[01:03:07] <Snake`s_Ghost> Berlin36, it will take you years and years so just start on something easy
[01:03:10] <Snake`s_Ghost> like golang
[01:03:13] <Snake`s_Ghost> or java
[01:03:23] <Berlin36> lemme run my randomizer..
[01:04:34] <Berlin36> aight
[01:04:38] <Snake`s_Ghost> java looks more like C
[01:04:42] <Berlin36> 1 is go, 2 is java
[01:04:44] <Snake`s_Ghost> go looks a little more like rust
[01:05:04] <Berlin36> ill go with go
[01:05:56] <Snake`s_Ghost> and by that i mean ttypes follow identifiers
[01:06:13] <Bco1981> C, if you don't use the cog, it will rust.
[01:06:36] <Berlin36> and umm
[01:06:40] <Berlin36> is Go hard?
[01:06:47] <Berlin36> like comparing to cpp
[01:06:53] <Snake`s_Ghost> no its easy in comparison
[01:06:59] <Berlin36> huh
[01:07:04] <Snake`s_Ghost> dont even need to free things or call malloc i think
[01:07:09] <Bco1981> where do you cpp?

[01:08:14] <Berlin36> wha sould i do
[01:08:18] <Berlin36> projects? exercises
[01:08:44] <Snake`s_Ghost> java gets a lot of shit from people like Linus but they have some kind of personality disorder and are really intense. also he cares so much about his linux kernel he knows why he don't use java for it and feels offended others don't feel the same way, which makes sense because it'd probably be bad for the kernel idk
[01:08:55] <Snake`s_Ghost> Berlin36, can you afford uni
[01:09:17] <Berlin36> well i still have time untill uni
[01:09:31] <Snake`s_Ghost> ah ok, yeah just write personal projects and have fun
[01:09:35] <Berlin36> im still in school now

[01:09:54] <Berlin36> what do people do in uni?
[01:09:59] <Berlin36> weird question

[01:10:36] <Bco1981> no drinking ?

[01:13:17] <Berlin36> oh
[01:13:21] <Snake`s_Ghost> class is nice
[01:13:45] <Snake`s_Ghost> otherwise you just end up sending a pointer into functions, this is similar to passing this into a method

[01:46:16] <Jigsy> They can be, but that's up to the developer.

[04:46:26] <Snake`s_Ghost> Perhaps our most dangerous bias is that we naturally assume that everyone else is more susceptible to thinking errors, a tendency known as the “bias blind spot.” This “meta-bias” is rooted in our ability to spot systematic mistakes in the decisions of others—we excel at noticing the flaws of friends—and inability to spot those same mistakes in ourselves. Although the bias blind spot itself isn’t a new concept, West’s latest paper demonstr
[04:46:26] <Snake`s_Ghost> ates that it applies to every single bias under consideration, from anchoring to so-called “framing effects.” In each instance, we readily forgive our own minds but look harshly upon the minds of other people.

[11:04:38] <zoidberg> I like Peanuts. Love them!
[11:04:38] <YoFrankieeee> but my point is he didn't start off as a great artist or anything. he just had some ideas and was consistent
[11:04:58] <YoFrankieeee> okay, so let's just stick with schulz for this example lol
[11:04:59] <jessedesu_onaph> That guy suckered me into reading his whole book on how to succeed

[11:05:05] <YoFrankieeee> lol
[11:05:20] <YoFrankieeee> or even, like, san rio. san rio isn't exactly high art, but it sells well

[11:14:14] <YoFrankieeee> it was weird, new strips kept coming long after he died
[11:14:28] <zoidberg> Woah, I didn’t know that.
[11:14:41] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I don't think much is wrong in the peanuts universe
[11:15:01] <zoidberg> Poor ol’ Charlie Brown has to suffer even after the death of author
[11:15:10] <YoFrankieeee> amigojapan: i mean Lucy is kind of a twat 
[11:15:24] <zoidberg> That’s interesting amigojapan

[11:19:14] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I don't understand why
[11:19:20] <zoidberg> Marcie is kind of nerd, isn’t she?
[11:19:36] <YoFrankieeee> zoidberg:  yeah, yeah, they are totally different, but one doesn't quite work without the other
[11:20:21] <zoidberg> YoFrankieeee: yeah, I get that. We have this in anime too.

[12:42:37] <YoFrankieeee> and i've been cutting back hardcore these last couple months, which means i am ultra sensitive too it i guess?

[18:09:59] <Sadale> damn. I may want to learn that. Actually before that I may wish to learn more about someone who lives in those low-living cost countries that's easy to move to in Latin America first.

[18:12:18] <Sadale> mecidine's cheap here as well. The government subsidize that.
[18:12:31] <Sadale> Except that the healthcare system here's two-tiered. The subsidized one is meh.
[18:12:35] <Sadale> The private one offers better quality
[18:13:06] <amigojapan> Yeah the government covers 70 percent in Japan which is one of the main reasons I am still here

[18:14:06] <Sadale> amigojapan, I've heard from another mexican. He told me that the safety's bad there and he wouldn't recommend me to move there
[18:14:32] <amigojapan> Sadale: HMmm you know I have not lived there in like 25 years
[18:14:40] <Sadale> amigojapan, fair enough
[18:15:09] <amigojapan> Sadale: safety is bad but about the same as America
[18:15:18] <Sadale> amigojapan, wow. I'm surprised on this one.
[18:15:20] <ButterNoodle> america is a continent
[18:15:34] <Sadale> Based on the context I think he means the US
[18:15:41] <ButterNoodle> and mexico is much less safe than the US

[18:22:21] <Sadale> Even a safer city like Hong Kong still isn't immune to crimes. Sometimes shit just happens
[18:22:29] <ButterNoodle> robbery is one thing.. but assault/violence is a different matter
[18:22:53] <ButterNoodle> theft happens everywhere.. desperate people go to places where there are things to steal
[18:23:13] <ButterNoodle> happens here.. people go to the good neighborhoods to commit crime
[18:23:21] <Sadale> damn. I don't get the point of assaulting people.
[18:23:26] <ButterNoodle> same
[18:23:27] <Sadale> People being assholes :/
[18:23:38] <Sadale> I mean if you target someone important, I do see the point.
[18:23:47] <amigojapan> In Japan people leave their iPhones on the table at restaurants and they don't get stolen
[18:23:51] <Sadale> But if you target someone random of a particular race, like why?
[18:24:02] <DunceCotus> pepang tom
[18:24:02] <ButterNoodle> stealing is one thing.. violence as a coincidence of stealing is just being a shit human.
[18:25:06] <ButterNoodle> I consider using a weapon as an intimidation tool to rob someone violence also
[18:25:08] <amigojapan> Sadale: ButterNoodle is just trying to scare you. There is violence in the US especially if you go to bars, fights break out all the time
[18:25:20] <Sadale> amigojapan, aw
[18:25:22] <ButterNoodle> you are making shit up amigojapan..
[18:25:30] <amigojapan> Nope

[18:25:41] <Sadale> I mean US is huge
[18:25:42] <ButterNoodle> some people
[18:25:57] <ButterNoodle> there are more poor places in mexico than the US
[18:25:59] <amigojapan> Sadale: so is Mexico
[18:26:00] <ButterNoodle> hence more crime
[18:26:04] <ButterNoodle> it follows
[18:26:04] <Sadale> true
[18:26:22] <Sadale> I might have better luck if I look at the stats than asking random people online :p
[18:26:40] <ButterNoodle> I'd say in rural mexico it would be no different than rural US.. not a lot of violent crime
[18:27:13] <ButterNoodle> go to chiraq(chicago) or mexico city.. probably gonna see some crime if u go to the poor parts of town
[18:27:14] <amigojapan> Yeah rural Mexico is penalty a better place to live. In that I agree
[18:27:49] <amigojapan> Probably not penalty
[18:28:01] <ButterNoodle> yea rural US and rural Mexico are going to be about the same crime wise.. Mexico arguably would have better food imho

[18:39:30] <ButterNoodle> how the fuck is austin so low on that list...
[18:39:38] <amigojapan> Sadale: there are towns for foreigners like San Miguel de Allende, so many Americans live there
[18:40:22] <Poeticode> suburbs suck
[18:40:32] <Poeticode> scaredy cats hiding from the city
[18:40:42] <ButterNoodle> not gonna get raped an killed in the suburbs typically
[18:41:04] <amigojapan> Poeticode: I live in the suburbs in Japan
[18:41:33] <amigojapan> Poeticode: rent is much cheaper
[18:42:20] <pteague> ButterNoodle, their increase rate is low? i'm guessing because they already have so many problems or there's something else going on?
[18:42:45] <pteague> i'm looking at dallas & kc numbers ...
[18:44:31] <ButterNoodle> yep.. those places have been high for a bit I would believer
[18:45:20] <Sadale> amigojapan, I'd imagine those towns would be more expensive tho :(
[18:45:27] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I live a good distance from the city where public transit doesnt.. so crime doesnt spill out here from the city

[18:45:34] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: naa
[18:45:38] <Sadale> amigojapan, I'm actually thinking if it'd be a good idea to move to somewhere with someone that I actually know.
[18:45:54] <Sadale> amigojapan, like moving to Cebu that's somewhere close to Miyu-saki
[18:46:12] <amigojapan> I see Sadale 
[18:46:23] <ButterNoodle> u could come live with uncle noodle Sadale-tan
[18:46:26] <Sadale> amigojapan, Or move to Lima in Peru that's close to pyon. I still have contact with him
[18:46:27] <ButterNoodle> :3
[18:46:38] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, US is too expensive. sorry :(
[18:46:49] <Sadale> I wouldn't have enough savings to move there
[18:46:55] <Sadale> I wouldn't have enough savings to move there as a NEET
[18:46:56] <ButterNoodle> yea rent right now is fucking crazy..
[18:47:09] <amigojapan> Sadale: I have not seen him in the programming channel any more
[18:47:10] <ButterNoodle> literally renting cost 2x as much as owning
[18:47:36] <ButterNoodle> which fucks poor people and foreigners
[18:47:48] <Sadale> amigojapan, I've got his twitter
[18:48:06] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, let's move to Cebu so that we'd be with Miyu-saki :3
[18:48:11] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, and davic after he moves there.
[18:48:23] <klaxa> it's almost as if trickle-down economics has never worked, but the elite told us to believe in it for like 50 years
[18:48:26] <amigojapan> Nice Sadale , by the way, I lost access to my Twitter account :(
[18:48:30] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, actually davic would be moving to somewhere close to Manila. He wanted to move to Cebu but his gf doesn't want to.

[18:52:41] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, the tax rate here's low tho
[18:52:46] <amigojapan> Just so you know darkwitch 
[18:52:50] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, it's progressive for up to 16%ish.
[18:52:54] <Sadale> s/for/to/
[18:53:07] <Sadale> So the max income tax would be 16%ish. Maybe 17%. I couldn't remember
[18:53:27] <Sadale> The benefits tho. It's meh here.
[18:54:56] <amigojapan> Sadale: in Japan since government hospitals and private hospitals are both covered by government insurance both kinds are pretty much the same

[19:04:53] <Sadale> stonks
[19:04:55] <zoidberg> Sadale: hentai?
[19:05:03] <Sadale> zoidberg, lol nope. stonks
[19:05:12] <Sadale> I just throw money into stock market every month
[19:05:19] <zoidberg> woah
[19:05:28] <zoidberg> good Sadale
[19:05:37] <Sadale> I'm gonna lose all of my savings \o/
[19:05:55] <darkwitch> if you die young they can't tax you when you get old
[19:06:49] <amigojapan> Sadale: my grandfather always said "don't keep all your eggs in one basket"which means buy many kinds of stocks
[19:06:54] <zoidberg> Sadale: depending on your investments who not take consultation from an expert?
[19:07:24] <zoidberg> It may cost some money but your investments would be safe
[19:07:29] <Sadale> zoidberg, I just have a portfolio and I invest the porpotion of my money based on my portfolio.
[19:07:41] <Sadale> zoidberg, so I'd get like 20% of ETF A, 30% of ETF B and so on
[19:07:52] <zoidberg> ah nice
[19:08:31] <zoidberg> Sadale: I wonder when we would really spend the money
[19:08:42] <zoidberg> Sadale: I hardly buy stuff :(
[19:08:47] <Sadale> zoidberg, when I retire.
[19:08:59] <Sadale> I'll live of my savings. That's when I'd spend my money
[19:09:12] <Sadale> I do buy shit from time to time. But I buy no where as much as I earn as of today.
[19:09:22] <zoidberg> Sadale: I don't know when to retire.
[19:09:42] <Sadale> move to Hong Kong to make money. Then get back to India after you're done with making money.
[19:09:51] <Sadale> It's probably more profitable to make money here :P

[19:10:27] <zoidberg> ah
[19:11:50] <zoidberg> nah, no programming for me
[19:12:45] <zoidberg> besides I am already involved in other project, no way the people would let me go
[19:12:54] <zoidberg> heh

[19:13:55] <Jigsy> I don't. :<
[19:14:01] <MootPoot> Me neither
[19:14:07] <amigojapan> Ouch Jigsy 
[19:15:16] <zoidberg> We don't truly understand ourselves amigojapan 
[19:15:26] <zoidberg> If we do life would be simpler
[19:15:28] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it seems like most of my batteries are not actually the mah rating that it says on the box
[19:15:32] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: Japan also has considerable safety nets offered from the tax
[19:15:34] <MootPoot> anywhere from 5% less to 20% less
[19:15:35] <Sadale> zoidberg, you could do real estate here as well.
[19:15:50] <Sadale> zoidberg, I've no idea on the job market. But there's a huge market of real estate here. The landprice is expensive af.
[19:16:02] <MootPoot> Sadale: I messed up my print bed
[19:16:16] <MootPoot> embedded plastic into it so now I have to use the glass one
[19:16:20] <Sadale> zoidberg, many people here enslaves themselves for most part of their life just for getting an apartment. :(
[19:16:26] <amigojapan> Yeah I have heard there are many fakes MootPoot 
[19:16:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, wat?
[19:16:28] <MootPoot> Is there anything different for using glass
[19:16:41] <zoidberg> haha Sadale, are you kidding? If I have that much, I would not need any job or even business
[19:16:41] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'd recommend sticking with the original build plate. The glass one sticks less well.
[19:16:46] <MootPoot> Sadale: fucked up my bed levelling - nozzle grinded plastic into it 
[19:16:49] <Sadale> zoidberg, aw true
[19:16:55] <MootPoot> no idea how to get it out
[19:16:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, it's ok. don't worry about it. It should still print.
[19:17:04] <MootPoot> Sadale: tried to , can't
[19:17:13] <MootPoot> plastic wont stick to that part
[19:17:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, I've done the same with my PET with glass. The surface of my PET's scratched. But it still prints okay
[19:17:20] <zoidberg> Sadale: besides like I said we started another project, I don't have money.
[19:17:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, Except that there'd be scratches on every single new print that I've got. Anwyay the mechanical function's okay
[19:17:51] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it seems like my chinese batteries have the most power, but are labelled the most wrong
[19:17:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, you sure that it can't print anymore? :O And are you sure that the problem is the build plate, not the nozzle?
[19:18:13] <Sadale> It could be that the nozzle's broken because it touched the buildplate.
[19:18:22] <MootPoot> Sadale: well, it prints properly on the corner ( seems like ) 
[19:18:30] <Sadale> I see :(
[19:18:44] <MootPoot> they gave me a bunch of nozzles, should swap it anyway now that you mention it
[19:19:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, Try swapping it anyway first. I think crealiaty sells the buildplate that comes with ender 3. You could buy a replacement buildplate (the non-glass one)

[19:19:43] <zoidberg> Sadale: my plan for retirement is make good rental income
[19:19:53] <zoidberg> Sadale: and rotate investments
[19:20:15] <Sadale> zoidberg, ah. Many people get rental income as well. It's apparent to be profitable here. Personally tho I think it's overhyped.
[19:20:27] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: I don't think he uses that nick very much
[19:20:35] <Sadale> zoidberg, people take mortage to purchase apartments for rental income. It's just too much risk to me
[19:20:46] <Sadale> I'd rather to get stonk without taking a loan instead. It's far safer.
[19:21:04] *** Joins: digin4 (~digin4@user/digin4)
[19:21:10] <zoidberg> Sadale: nah, it's not profitable. It is profitable in cases where there is very good appreciation for property.
[19:21:28] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: he uses it around Halloween
[19:21:41] <amigojapan> Ah ok Urchin[emacs] 
[19:21:44] <zoidberg> Sadale: the rental returns here at least are quite less compared to bank returns
[19:21:46] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], I'm thinking if I should join nofap november this time
[19:22:09] <Sadale> zoidberg, I haven't done the math. I suspect that the rental income could be about the same as stonks income here.
[19:22:21] <Sadale> zoidberg, Many people believe that rental income is the way of investment tho.
[19:22:29] <Sadale> I don't buy into that
[19:22:32] <zoidberg> but property value increases eventually and with inflation, rental is better for long term
[19:22:55] <Sadale> same goes with stonks
[19:23:28] <Sadale> stonks value, when you're talking about the market as whole, increases eventually with inflation. As long as the governments are printing money, the money has to end up being in somewhere
[19:23:35] <zoidberg> how much are you aiming for Sadale?
[19:23:36] <MootPoot> cum
[19:23:54] <Sadale> zoidberg, 7%
[19:23:58] <Sadale> cum
[19:24:08] <zoidberg> Sadale: I want 1000 usd per month, that's all
[19:24:09] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], you joining nofap november tho?
[19:24:15] <Sadale> zoidberg, that's a lot
[19:24:25] <Sadale> That's 12000 USD per year.
[19:25:00] <zoidberg> Sadale: I already get around ~450 usd per month in rentals
[19:25:09] <Sadale> Asssuming interest rate of 1%, that'd requires $1,200,000. If you can get to 2%, that'd be $600,000
[19:25:17] <Sadale> zoidberg, lucky you
[19:25:28] <amigojapan> zoidberg: 1000usd per month earnings? In Japan it would not be enough
[19:25:37] <zoidberg> yes amigojapan 
[19:25:44] <Sadale> zoidberg, you have to take inflation into account tho
[19:25:48] <zoidberg> it's enough in India, amigojapan 
[19:25:58] <Sadale> After 20 years or so 1000 USD per month may not be a lot
[19:26:03] <amigojapan> Nice zoidberg 
[19:26:16] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: yes
[19:26:21] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], have fun! :3
[19:26:28] <zoidberg> Sadale: yeah, that plus I will have money rotating in capital investments
[19:26:32] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], would you still be fapping without cumming, or would you just stop fapping?
[19:26:35] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: join in on the fun
[19:26:41] <Sadale> zoidberg, what did you mean by rotating?
[19:26:43] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], I'm thinking about that
[19:27:27] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: well, most important is to avoid cumming
[19:27:29] <MootPoot> banana
[19:27:34] <zoidberg> Sadale: investing in different projects and taking money from those projects and invest in others
[19:27:38] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], lol true
[19:27:54] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], sounds more fun to me if I keep fapping without cumming. But I'm not sure if I'd be able to take that
[19:28:01] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: there was already locktober, but that kind of requires equipment
[19:28:10] <zoidberg> Sadale: I think I would do better with inflation as I am calculating based on rental income. I want 1000 usd in rental income
[19:28:21] <Sadale> It's funny how I'm talking with Urchin[emacs] and zoidberg at the same time. On one hand I'm talking about lewds. On the other hand I'm talking about investments.
[19:28:22] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: it's entirely doable
[19:28:50] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], I see. I don't have this kind of equipment. I could 3D print one tho. Except that I'd be in trouble in case I get caught using this kind of equipment.

[19:44:23] <Sadale> davic, mine's doing ok. I'd make $2000 if I sell all of them rn.
[19:44:23] <davic> Sadale: well I just bought stonks on like 5 companies that are going IPO
[19:44:35] <Sadale> davic, oh. I purchased ETFs instead.
[19:44:48] <davic> I had swedish funds but sold em
[19:44:50] <davic> for stonks
[19:44:59] <Sadale> ETFs is less risky because it includes the entire market. However it costs management fee.
[19:45:02] <davic> etfs arent quite popular in SE
[19:45:17] <Sadale> It isn't quite popular here either. But I think it's the best thing I should invest in
[19:45:26] <Sadale> Mainly because I'm too lazy to evaluate each individual stonks
[19:45:38] <Urchin[emacs]> davic: are they any good?
[19:45:41] <MootPoot> are cadmium batteries banned 
[19:45:44] <Sadale> And I'm too lazy to time the market. I just want to spend less time on purchasing stonks
[19:46:05] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: probably a good enough decision
[19:46:19] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[19:46:23] <Sadale> of course it's a good decision as of today because the stonks are on the rise :P
[19:46:32] <Sadale> It's a good decision until the stonks drop xD
[19:46:35] <davic> Sadale: swedish funds are weird. basically its a whole different marketplace for the funds. you don't buy.. like stocks or something you just put in money from like a minimum of 10 usd and you get a percentage of a stock
[19:46:41] <Sadale> Then I'd become davic II
[19:46:58] <davic> Sadale: I bought a ton of stonks on discount
[19:47:08] <davic> biggest stonk I has now is Flat Capital
[19:47:12] <Sadale> davic, weird indeed
[19:47:36] <Sadale> This kind of funds exist here as well. But I've never purchased any of them. I just focus on purchasing ETFs.

[21:35:43] <Urchin[emacs]> MootPoot: I suppose I could use A Song of Ice and Fire as an example, or Harry Potter to an extent (though Bookworm is far superior in it's magic school arc)
[21:36:15] <MootPoot> Bco1981: usb c or thunderbolt?
[21:36:20] <Bco1981> usb-c
[21:36:26] <MootPoot> can you even send video over normal usb
[21:36:48] <MootPoot> well, try it and let me know how it goes
[21:36:48] <Bco1981> no that's why it's a combo hdmi/usb -> usb-c
[21:37:35] <Bco1981> won't have time to test it until monday
[21:39:10] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: honestly from your description is sounds like I'll either watch it and it'll be okay, or I'll hard drop it after like ep 2 - I'm not expecting much
[21:39:38] * MootPoot shrugs

[21:44:06] <Urchin[emacs]> well, it's a work about a girl who's dream is to be a librarian, and only manages to make paper in like episode 7
[21:44:23] <Urchin[emacs]> in a world pretty much without books
[21:44:24] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: I feel like you'll hate it, but that doesn't make it not good
[21:44:34] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: but based on basically everything you ever say, it does not seem like your kind of thing
[21:45:45] <MootPoot> Slow grinds are fine but not slow grinds where the entire point of the show is to make books
[21:45:46] <MootPoot> lol
[21:45:52] <MootPoot> I need something actually happening
[21:46:12] <ObakeNoises> inventing books IS something actually happening though
[21:46:19] <MootPoot> meh
[21:46:24] <ObakeNoises> it's substantially MORE than happens in most isekai about fighting a demon king really
[21:46:35] <ObakeNoises> they have a big goal in theory but it's all window dressing
[21:46:52] <MootPoot> meh
[21:47:28] <ObakeNoises> again, I don't acutally recommend it to you personally, MootPoot, I think recs should be tailored to the person and I think you'd hate it, but I need to push back at this idea that a smaller goal is inherently more boring
[21:48:03] <ObakeNoises> what percentage of isekai actually have a demon king get defeated before the LN gets cancelled?
[21:48:29] <MootPoot> I never said a smaller goal is the issue- its just that that particular goal is the issue
[21:48:31] <ObakeNoises> it's just a hypothetical goal in the background of the real plot, which is running around meeting new waifus
[21:48:50] <ObakeNoises> whereas something like Book Loli, she actually makes concrete progress
[21:50:02] <MootPoot> The idea of making books is a little...idk - dull and stupid?

[22:18:13] <MootPoot> I zone out in the middle of a gunfight sometimes
[22:18:45] <ObakeNoises> MootPoot: I mean, if I'm not understanding at least a certain amount, I can't stay focussed unless whatever else is going on is very interesting
[22:18:48] <Berlin36> it's not like you should like them, but why do people write those hate comments?
