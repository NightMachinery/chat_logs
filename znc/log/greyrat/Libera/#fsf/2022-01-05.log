[03:02:34] <isf> Gmail is run by Google and was specifically named as part of the PRISM spying program. There is no way to use the web client without running nonfree JavaScript.
[03:02:50] <isf> so, gmail dont respect your freedom
[03:02:57] <isf> tutanota respect your freedom
[03:03:19] <Noisytoot> I'm not recommending it. You don't need to use the web client (and privacy is another issue). The problem is registration.
[03:03:21] <isf> if have pop imap smptp etc, are a technical issue, not a freedom issue.
[03:03:49] <Noisytoot> If you can register with free JS (which you can't with Gmail) and you can use POP/IMAP/SMTP, you don't need to use any nonfree software.
[03:03:56] <isf> always you run nonfree software for have a google service
[03:04:08] <isf> so, please dont recommend google
[03:04:15] <isf> google stuff dont respect the user freedoms
[03:04:21] <White_Flame> you should google an alternative ;)
[03:04:38] <Noisytoot> I did not recommend Google and you don't need nonfree JS once you have registered if you use POP/IMAP/SMTP.

[21:57:07] <kompowiec> The first C compiler was written in a different language: BCPL, so it used BCPL compiler.
[21:57:07] <kompowiec> The BCPL compiler was written in BCPL itself, so new versions of BCPL needed older versions of BCPL to be compiled, similarly to GCC.
[21:57:08] <kompowiec> The first version of BCPL was written in AED, or Algol.
