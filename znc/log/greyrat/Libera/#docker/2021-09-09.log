[02:34:45] <Lyn> Does anyone have experience with Docker-OSX? How is it structured exactly, does it run GUIs?
[02:35:20] <ada_> structured?
[02:35:40] <ada_> well, it uses an embedded vm and emulator to simulate an x86 linux environment
[02:35:42] <Lyn> yeah like is the OS inside a container, or a bind mount perhaps, or is it just a VBox file
[02:36:16] <ada_> it's not vbox, but it does have its "disk" persisted to a file
[02:36:35] <Lyn> it simulates linux? what about the OSX
[02:36:37] <ada_> OS X itself can't run containers
[02:37:30] <BtbN> The Docker OSX thing literally is qemu in docker running osx
[02:37:32] <ada_> there's no docker for native OSX, and I suspect you'd have trouble running a linux program with a GUI because you don't have an Xserver in the embedded VM
[02:37:56] <Lyn> I'm aiming to run OSX on a Linux machine
[02:38:04] <ada_> use a VM
[02:38:22] <ada_> that isn't a good use case for Docker, unfortunately
[02:39:07] <Lyn> hmm, so docker -> qemu -> osx
[02:39:24] <ada_> im not really sure how to interpret that graph
[02:39:35] <BtbN> If you want an OSX VM, docker is literally pointless and probably even a hinderance.
[02:39:56] <Lyn> I'm having a hard time figuring out what's the purpose of Docker-OSX then
[02:39:57] <ada_> osx runs docker app.  docker app uses qemu to run an x86 VM.  in the VM is a linux kernel.  in the VM, dockerd runs.
[02:40:19] <BtbN> Other way around
[02:40:22] <Lyn> I'm not interested in running Linux through Docker, but rather the OSX
[02:40:25] <BtbN> in docker runs qemu, in qemu runs OSX.
[02:40:35] <BtbN> You cannot run OSX in Docker
[02:41:05] <Lyn> but.. what's the point of Docker-OSX then?
[02:41:14] <ada_> what do you mean
[02:41:20] <ada_> Lyn: I don't understand the question
[02:41:35] <BtbN> It's some kind of toy/proof-of-concept to have OSX "inside" of a Docker container.
[02:41:40] <Lyn> https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX I'm talking about this if you didn't know it yet
[02:41:42] <BtbN> By running a full VM in a docker container.

[02:42:00] <ada_> Lyn: yeah I assumed you were talking about docker desktop for osx
[02:42:05] <Lyn> I see, so I shouldn't use it then
[02:42:26] <BtbN> If you want OSX for dev stuff, you need a physical Mac either way
[02:43:00] <ada_> yeah I can't speak to this project, know nothing about it
[02:43:09] <BtbN> It's literally qemu in docker.
[02:43:13] <BtbN> That's all it is
[02:43:15] <ada_> its not hard to understand
[02:43:20] <ada_> just didn't know it existed
[02:43:28] <ada_> I thought we were talking about docker desktop FOR OSX
[02:43:36] <Lyn> yea understandable
[02:43:54] <dreamer> I tried that one, it's cute but I didn't want to spend disk space for a full OSX recovery :#
[02:44:51] <devslash-> off topic but if you want to run Mac OS in a VM, you can do that in virtualbox
[02:45:28] <ada_> what a confusing name for a project
[02:46:00] <devslash-> what is Docker-OSX 
[02:46:07] <ada_> https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX
[02:46:44] <devslash-> thats not a true native OS X o.s.
[02:46:58] <Lyn> I found this article about it which shows an actual GUI of the OSX-VM in Ubuntu https://www.linuxuprising.com/2021/03/install-macos-big-sur-or-catalina-in.html

[15:47:36] <L0j1k> lilalinux: what you're looking for is typically what people use an entrypoint script for, where the image is created with a shell script as the ENTRYPOINT and the COMMAND is used to pass the executable (or params) that will run in your container.
[15:48:30] <L0j1k> and in the shell script it does some stuff and then uses exec to run whatever's passed as the COMMAND

[21:36:21] <programmerq> Inge▸ if I have an image that specified VOLUME /foo/data then when I run that container, an anonymous volume will be attached to the container's /foo/data. If I want a bind mount instead of an anonymous volume, I can just do: docker run -v /some/host/path:/foo/data ...

[21:36:37] *** Joins: mohabaks (~mohabaks@gateway/tor-sasl/mohabaks)
[21:37:01] <programmerq> you can also use --mount instead of -v and whatever you specify at runtime will override that anonymous volume default.
[21:37:36] <programmerq> the only thing you can't do is say "/foo/data should not be a volume at all" for an image that says "/foo/data should be a volume". That's the only situation where you'd need to rebuild the Dockerfile.
[21:38:25] <programmerq> an image author should always set VOLUME /whatever for any location inside the container that ought to have persistent data written to it. They should also specify that for any other written data (such as cache data) that shouldn't go on the container's write layer.
