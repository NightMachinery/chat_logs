[00:00:27] <kuudes> the money does not go to police, but to the state in general
[00:00:40] <kuudes> personally I would like the money to go to central bank, so that in effect it would be burned
[00:00:53] <kuudes> the point is punishment, not benefit to anyone
[00:01:11] <kuudes> "“This is no constitutionally governed state,” one Finn who was fined nearly $50,000 moaned to The Wall Street Journal, “This is a land of rhinos!” Outrage among the rich—especially nonsensical, safari-invoking outrage—might be a sign that something fair is at work."
[00:01:33] <kuudes> you know, if you can't do the fine, don't do the crime or whatever
[00:01:39] <pompolic> "the point is punishment" - i'm being uncharitable but that sure is a sentence out of context
[00:01:54] <kuudes> ?
[00:02:05] <kuudes> punitive system's point is punishment
[00:02:11] <pompolic> yep
[00:02:13] <kuudes> like, prison is a net loss for everyone
[00:02:26] <kuudes> it costs for the state and the prisoners lack their freedom
[00:02:43] <ggreer> yes yes we get it. sometimes finland has big fines. now what's the probability of being caught with a modded scooter? the police would have to catch you exceeding the speed limit on level ground (or uphill). then you have the option of fighting it in court or not (depending on how severe the punishment is)
[00:02:52] <ggreer> also feep doesn't live in finland. he lives in germany. their laws and levels of enforcement are totally different
[00:03:01] <kuudes> sure
[00:03:02] <ggreer> in the US people mod their scooters and ebikes all the time
[00:03:13] <kuudes> I know my friends have lost their mopeds for tuning when I was in school
[00:03:37] <kuudes> on rural areas, maybe there are less people there etc
[00:03:48] <kuudes> but on downtowns of cities there are more people
[00:03:56] <ggreer> I knew one tech CEO who used a modded ebike to get around SF super fast. it was much easier than uber/lyft. he could (ab)use the bike lane and he could take the bike inside (unlike a gas motorcycle)
[00:03:57] <PapuaHardyNet> finland sounds like an interesting place for sure
[00:04:08] <ggreer> top speed was around 35mph I think
[00:04:21] <ggreer> which in a congested city like SF is more than fast enough
[00:04:23] <kuudes> hmm, thats 56 km/h
[00:04:27] <PapuaHardyNet> that modded ebike sounds awesome
[00:04:32] <kuudes> so that is faster than mopeds are allowed to go
[00:04:43] <kuudes> so that would be a motorcycle per eu classifications
[00:04:45] <ggreer> it's faster than ebikes are allowed to go in the US
[00:04:53] <kuudes> yeah, that would be dayfines here
[00:05:06] <ggreer> he did it for years and never got caught
[00:05:17] <kuudes> in usa a lot of people are not caught for a lot of things
[00:05:28] <kuudes> and people don't call the police on each other
[00:05:45] <kuudes> over here it is perfectly nonaggressive to call the police for a traffic accident etc
[00:05:46] <ggreer> yeah they do. people call the cops all the time. but who is going to call the cops on an ebike?
[00:06:00] <ggreer> we definitely call the cops for traffic collisions
[00:06:08] <ggreer> most insurance recommends doing so
[00:06:17] <kuudes> ok then
[00:06:51] <kuudes> I mean, in usa it seems many groups have special internal court systems for internal disputes etc
[00:07:08] <kuudes> which is because involving the state there is potentially so harmful for the parties
[00:07:31] <spxtr> what are these special internal court systems you speak of?
[00:07:53] <ggreer> you mean binding arbitration? it's faster than civil suits, yeah, but I don't know if it's the majority of "court" cases. it's certainly not the majority of what lawyers do
[00:07:57] <kuudes> didn't rationalists have some sort of reconciliation thingy in bay area for example?
[00:08:11] <kuudes> some people got raped and their matter was handled internally
[00:08:16] <ggreer> maybe but I never heard of it in person, and my housemate worked at MIRI
[00:08:30] <spxtr> that sounds illegal
[00:08:35] <kuudes> ok then
[00:08:41] <kuudes> I don't know. usa is wild west in my books
[00:09:21] <ggreer> spxtr: such a body would have no legal standing, but if both parties agree... nobody's gonna stop them
[00:09:30] <spxtr> I suppose that's true
[00:09:49] <ggreer> this is how court TV shows tend to work. though some also have a binding arbitration agreement beforehand
[00:09:52] <spxtr> struck me as illegal because in some cases people are mandatory reporters, but that's obviously not generally true

[00:11:09] <ggreer> > The "judge shows" that have become popular in many countries, especially the United States, are actually binding arbitration. The People's Court and Judge Judy are notable examples.
[00:11:46] <kuudes> well, it works to such extent that at least the sanest rich people just employ drivers so that they never drive themselves here :-p
[00:11:50] <ggreer> though for disputes between large corporations, sometimes there's not even a legal agreement to binding arbitration. they just pick an umpire and abide by the decision
[00:12:15] <ggreer> isn't that a thing I said I would do if I were a rich person with those incentives?
[00:12:31] <ggreer> it makes perfect sense. the fine must be paid by the poor person and I can speed all day long
[00:12:44] <kuudes> could be but I don't see "driver" in my immediate logs. it would make sense though
[00:13:07] <kuudes> no it would not work
[00:13:11] <ggreer> I knew about the fine system years ago. it was definitely on freenode that I mentioned it
[00:13:17] <kuudes> ah, ok then
[00:13:23] <kuudes> don't know, very possible
[00:13:40] <kuudes> if you tell/order someone to commit a crime, you are liable for same crime
[00:14:14] <ggreer> yeah but good luck proving that in court
[00:14:19] <kuudes> I presume you could get out of a few fines, but if it came to be a habit, I would presume a court would start sentencing you
[00:14:43] <kuudes> police have targeted some specific speeders personally
[00:14:53] <kuudes> ie had operations to give them constantly speeding fines
[00:15:02] <ggreer> yes that's a thing that happens in the US too. usually by corrupt police departments
[00:15:41] <kuudes> police here don't get the money from the fines etc, they have a montly salary

[00:24:35] <ggreer> compared to most countries, yes the US is the wild west. but from my point of view, other countries look insanely oppressive
[00:24:55] <kuudes> median state in the world has about 5M persons, finland is about comparable
[00:25:25] <kuudes> hmm, I guess then your preferences are more satisfied being there? thats nice :)

[00:26:28] <kuudes> minnesota has barely more people than finland, 5.7M compared to 5.5M
[00:27:01] <kuudes> but yes, I am genuinely happy for you to have your preferences satisfied in this matter, ggreer
[00:27:29] <kuudes> there are tradeoffs between a lots of stuff, and it is good if people can get them more to their preferences

[00:49:42] <shawwwn> TIL "tendentious". Nice word.
[00:49:44] <gwern> that's also part of the problem. lex being so famous and popular
[00:50:13] <shawwwn> why's that a problem?
[00:50:23] <gwern> I don't want to be famous or popular
[00:50:29] <ggreer> you can't undo becoming famous
[00:50:30] <shawwwn> I do. Refer 'em over to me
[00:50:56] <ggreer> you need a front man. kinda like Watari was to Near
[00:51:07] <ggreer> err L
[00:51:09] * gwern notes that near isdead
[00:51:22] <shawwwn> not that near :P
[00:51:42] <ggreer> I mean the show is called Death Note, not... Everybody Lives Happily Ever After Note
[00:52:05] <gwern> shawwwn: ok, '*both* nears are dead'
[00:52:11] <shawwwn> they are? news to me
[00:52:17] <shawwwn> I thought near in the show survived
[00:52:31] <gwern> everyone dies of old age eventually
[00:52:41] <shawwwn> he was a kid.
[00:52:50] <gwern> it's a detective show, not a transhumanist sf show
[00:53:02] <shawwwn> yes, I'm quite sure he'd still be alive
[00:53:15] <gwern> bah humbug. fine, 'a near is dead'
[00:53:34] <shawwwn> I think you just forgot near survived at the end of death note and were hoping to jedi mind trick your way past everyone pointing and laughing
[00:53:40] <shawwwn> haw haw, gwern forgot a thing
[00:53:51] <shawwwn> he's not perfect
[00:53:55] * gwern did in fact accidentally swap mello for near
[00:54:14] <shawwwn> you should do the podcast. but I anticipate 0% chance you'll do the podcast
[00:54:26] <shawwwn> and you'll come up with a bunch of reasons why it makes sense to pass
[00:54:46] <gwern> well yes, they'd be the same reasons why I have passed on all the many podcast offers in the past, but more so
[00:55:01] <shawwwn> sure. reasons that seem invalid
[00:55:24] <shawwwn> he just wants to chat with you. none of your reasons are related to "why would it be a bad idea to chat?"
[00:55:42] <shawwwn> because it's really not a bad idea. but Because Audio, you'll do whatever it takes to get out of it
[00:55:47] <ggreer> it's hard to remain a pseudonym if your voice is out there
[00:56:08] <ggreer> who's the second most famous pseudonym? satoshi is number one, but I don't know of a close second
[00:56:26] <shawwwn> gwern doesn't really care about that. the pseudonymity is just to look cool. 
[00:56:35] <adiabatic> I wouldn't do it. your work is more valuable than, say, 0HPL and he's done a podcast with a voice changer
[00:56:36] <shawwwn> podcasting with lex would increase that coolness factor.
[00:56:52] <gwern> shawwwn: I have no issue with merely chatting with lex. I'm sure it would be an enjoyable discussion. the problem comes in with 'taking video and audio and broadcasting it to millions of people'
[00:57:29] <shawwwn> there are no problems. you're fooling yourself. but it's what you want to believe, so no one'll be able to convince you otherwise.
[00:57:50] <shawwwn> may as well just tell him "thanks, but no thanks" and move on.
[00:58:40] <ggreer> chatting with him but not recording a podcast seems like a fun time for both of you. it's a shame that we won't all be able to listen to the discussion, but it'd be a good thing on net
[00:58:59] <gwern> yeah, but also a bad reason to go to austin for
[01:00:49] <PapuaHardyNet> is there a coherent philosophy or rationale to gwern's pseudonymity?

[01:01:22] <shawwwn> no. it's unclear even to himself.
[01:01:31] <PapuaHardyNet> after all, he has left the whole dark web market research domain so I see no reason for him to sacrifice connections and opportunities for pseudonymity

[01:01:50] <Robomot> 11 Reasons Not to Become Famous (or “A Few Lessons Learned Since 2007”) – The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss (November of 2008. I had more hair, a flip phone, and absolutely no idea what was coming. Let the cymbals of popularity tinkle still. Let the butterflies of fame glitter with their wings. I shall envy neither their music nor their colors.)
[01:05:43] <ggreer> there are lots of people who don't become famous. jaan tallinn has said he doesn't want to be famous because: 1. once you're famous, you stay famous. 2. you can't walk into a public place and have normal conversations with people
[01:07:06] * gwern notices strife's new avatar. hm. integra hellsing *does* make a plausible mtf
[01:07:07] <shawwwn> I think conversations like these are how gwern fools himself into being fine passing up opportunities like this podcast. Because, obviously, he's not going to become famous as a result of this. But it's tempting to believe he might, and so therefore "it's a good idea to say no"
[01:07:25] <Betawolf> but gwern's already famous
[01:07:37] <two2thehead> shawwwn, I think you're pressuring gwern too much
[01:07:51] <two2thehead> He said he doesn't want to, that's pretty clear to me
[01:07:59] <shawwwn> two2thehead: I'd agree if there was any chance he was going to do it in the first place
[01:08:28] <gwern> Betawolf: I'm not famous like, say, bret weinstein, to name one of the most recent videos on fridman's 1.15 million subscriber channel
[01:08:31] <shawwwn> he was just dropping it to look cool in lesswrong. "Ooh, lex friedman! Wow, you're telling him no. So cool~~"
[01:08:37] <two2thehead> sounds like being overbearing to me, but I admit that I could be wrong
[01:08:43] <gwern> shawwwn: and what's wrong with that
[01:09:03] <gwern> am I not allowed to be even a smidgen proud of it
[01:09:11] <two2thehead> gwern, exactly
[01:09:14] <shawwwn> because it's dumb to pass it up.
[01:09:30] <two2thehead> aaand we are back to being overbearing
[01:09:40] <two2thehead> time for me to bow out of this conversation
[01:09:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree with shawwwn though
[01:09:45] <shawwwn> trust me, there was no chance he was gonna do it in the first place
[01:09:49] <Betawolf> it's only dumb to pass up an opportunity if you actually want the result
[01:10:10] <linear> what about a tail-risk advantage of not being able to be impersonated by AI if no one can find pictures/audio/movies of you
[01:10:16] <kuudes> how do we know gwern is not alread famous and this is just his alt?
[01:10:36] <PapuaHardyNet> its not like a podcast appearance is really going to make him famous. Not just that - he can use voice changers or whatever, I'm sure the host would not mind if they really wanted to talk to gwern
[01:10:59] <ggreer> oh that's right. lex only does in-person interviews
[01:11:09] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, I see
[01:11:32] <PapuaHardyNet> then gwern's decision makes sense to me
[01:13:09] <ggreer> do a podcast with lex now, then when lex does a podcast with putin (apparently this is lex's life goal or something) you can lord it over ol' vlad. "yeah I was on lex before he sold out"
[01:13:36] <ggreer> though you might want to purchase a geiger counter beforehand
[01:15:02] <gwern> why does lex like putin so much?

[01:17:41] <ggreer> I think lex is fascinated by the man and since he wants to get an interview, he's not going to state the obvious (that putin is a scary dude who rules with an iron fist)

[02:22:19] <rmmh> they're a somewhat recent invention, but fundamentally you don't need vision to belay, just a sense of tension on the rope

[03:46:55] <galambo_> nothing really special about them but I tried many brands and those one sticked. they are infinitely better than the bic 4 in 1.
[03:47:11] <quanticle> Do you order just the body and a bunch of refills, then? I guess I'm asking what happens if one of the colors runs out, but the other two are still going strong.
[03:47:17] * gwern seems to have hit a nerve with this one
[03:47:36] <galambo_> quanticle, yes I buy this also: https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B00J8L5CPK

[03:47:51] <ggreer> I'd love to climb trees but the liability issues are so huge. I don't think it could be done safely unless you were lead climbing and had clip-ins all over the place
[03:48:08] <quanticle> gwern: Really surprised that the climbing gym one hit a nerve and the VTuber/Youtuber/Streamer memorabilia hedge fund passed in relative silence
[03:48:10] <galambo_> I dont need to buy red or blue refills because they tend to last. I probably lose the pen before I run out of those

[03:55:09] <quanticle> After a lot more discussion and thinking it over, we've decided that we like it here and we're too lazy to move
[03:55:41] <gwern> I think it's more like 'welp, the bay area didn't dissolve during corona, so we're stuck'
[03:56:38] <quanticle> Yeah, I've been a remote work pessimist all throughout this pandemic
[03:56:56] <quanticle> I feel like a lot of people are going to be very surprised by the level of snap-back we see towards physical offices.
[03:57:04] <ggreer> the majority of my coworkers left
[03:57:18] <ggreer> though my work did have a lot of incentives like terrible COLA
[03:58:07] <quanticle> Yeah, but your company is tiny and, on the grand scheme of things, probably irrelevant. Meanwhile, my dad's company which is a Fortune 500 with like mid-six figures employees just announced that people would be coming back to the office starting Labor Day.
[03:58:53] <quanticle> And my company (which is also tiny and probably irrelevant) just announced that people would be eventually coming back to the office, though no fixed timeline was given.
[03:58:55] <gwern> I've been more of 'agglomerations gonna agglomerate but this will lower the cap on rents by improving the BATNA' guy. I expect a lot of people and companies to go permanently remote but the grand effect will be to put a cap on SF rents at, say, $3000/month instead of $3500/month
[03:59:28] <ggreer> I think most places are making everyone return to the office in mid-september
[03:59:37] <gwern> syncing up with the school year huh
[03:59:54] <quanticle> Yes, agreed with that assessment, but I would also caveat it with, "And rents in the outlying suburbs of SF are probably going to explode"
[03:59:57] <synthmeat> i know of fortune 25 one that's welcoming remote for anything where it makes sense (IT especially)
[04:00:13] <ggreer> housing prices in walnut creek and concord have gone way up
[04:00:15] <quanticle> A two hour commute is shitty, but it's tolerable if you only have to do it three days a week or whatever
[04:00:36] <adiabatic> 2h one way, or total?
[04:00:46] <ggreer> hmm... it's probably 90 minutes each way
[04:00:59] <kuudes> that feels long
[04:01:03] <ggreer> it is
[04:01:04] <quanticle> It is
[04:01:05] <synthmeat> we need to figure out how to put commute into work time. like legit work, not here's a little extra money
[04:01:23] <kuudes> when I was working in 75 km away from my home my drive there was about 1h to direction
[04:01:24] <ggreer> but if you get on in concord, you'll get a seat. you can work or read and be relatively comfortable on the bart ride
[04:01:33] <quanticle> synthmeat: Well, if you can tolerate reading or looking at a screen while on a bus, the FAANG buses all have wifi...
[04:01:51] <synthmeat> why the fuck would i tolerate that
[04:01:52] <catern> quanticle: great celebration of labor to force people back into the office on labor day
[04:01:54] <quanticle> (Unfortunately, when I worked at Microsoft, that was never an option for me because I get motion-sick)
[04:02:00] <kuudes> I was about to write "why would you need wifi" but then I remembered
[04:02:01] <synthmeat> it's inhuman
[04:02:05] <quanticle> catern: Trust me, the irony isn't lost
[04:02:23] <gwern> synthmeat: money/time is fungible. there's no difference between marking out commute time and increasing salary by the same mount. what is necessary is for workers to learn about the 'commuting paradox' and that they are underpricing commutes
[04:02:44] <Fusxfaranto> what's inhuman about that?  for me that was a major office
[04:02:46] <Fusxfaranto> perk
[04:02:59] <Logos01> So I realized the other day that I'm going to have to start taking my older cat to the vet more often (read: ever), as she starts to get closer and closer to being truly senescent.
[04:03:12] <quanticle> How old is oldcat?
[04:03:14] <gwern> Logos01: you could always do mad science
[04:03:23] <Logos01> So it made me reexamine my cat carrier -- and I realized that I'm not as dirt-broke destitute as I was when I last bought a carrier.
[04:03:27] <Logos01> So I upgraded: https://www.amazon.com/Petsfit-Foldable-Travel-Carrier-Soft-Sided/dp/B07MB93R1Y/

[04:03:32] <gwern> there's zero reason to think senolytics or rapamycin wouldn't work on cats
[04:03:34] <kuudes> I guess commuting could be one way to go around worktime restrictions?
[04:03:37] <catern> quanticle: do you personally prefer to work remotely or in-person?
[04:04:02] <Logos01> quanticle: I'm actually not 100% sure.  I found her in 2007 and she was somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5 years.
[04:04:13] <Logos01> So basic guesstimate is 15 or 16.
[04:04:18] <quanticle> catern: Remotely, but I'm realistic about what's going to happen
[04:04:29] <gwern> (the early results from rapamycin on dogs have been quite positive, and rapamycin and senolytics in general have proven pretty generic cross-species)
[04:04:31] <Logos01> The whole bit where it has expandable sides that you can "let out" so the cat doesn't feel quite so contained is amusing to me at least.
[04:04:41] <kuudes> I presume I will continue remoting the same as before pandemic
[04:04:45] <Logos01> It's a bit weird but I'm leaving it out for the cats to <strike>shred into pieces immediately thus invalidating the purchase</strike> explore and get use to.
[04:04:45] * quanticle has actually been going into the office two to three days a week just to get into the habit so it won't hurt as much when the order does come
[04:04:52] <synthmeat> Fusxfaranto: i over-reacted. what gwern said is the actual truth though, it's severely underpriced.
[04:05:03] <quanticle> Logos01: Older than Maru
[04:05:05] <quanticle> That is an old cat
[04:05:20] <Fusxfaranto> yeah i agree with that
[04:05:28] <kuudes> why do you guys not live more near to your work btw?
[04:05:28] <quanticle> kuudes: Lol
[04:05:34] <gwern> only 15 or 16? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creme_Puff_(cat) laughs

She was the oldest cat ever recorded, according to the 2010 edition of Guinness World Records,[1][2][3] when she died aged 38 years and 3 days. …)
[04:05:44] <Logos01> quanticle: I moved to Utah with 3 cats.
[04:05:48] <ggreer> residential property near SF is insanely expensive
[04:05:56] <quanticle> kuudes: I like living out in the suburbs. It's nice and quiet
[04:05:57] <synthmeat> kuudes: i don't want to leave my home at all besides for leisure activities
[04:05:58] <Logos01> She was the youngest, and is the only one still not buried beneath the pear tree in my back yard.
[04:06:05] <quanticle> And the chance of random riots is blessedly low
[04:06:14] <synthmeat> Let's Make Going Out Great Again
[04:06:18] <kuudes> why don't you get other job?
[04:06:22] <Logos01> She is actually older now than the male cat was when he solved his personal Halting problem.
[04:06:25] <gwern> kuudes: well, that's the 'commuting paradox'.
[04:06:40] <catern> kuudes: I am immune to the commuting paradox: I live a block away from my office
[04:06:41] <Logos01> But she's still younger than the other female cat that moved up here with me -- she made it to be 18.
[04:06:51] <catern> not that that's been at all helpful to me in the last year and a half
[04:07:01] <quanticle> Logos01: Your cat is a baushka
[04:07:04] <quanticle> *babushka
[04:07:09] <kuudes> will you take your graves with you when you move, Logos01?
[04:07:21] <Logos01> kuudes: I didn't even mark them.
[04:07:24] <kuudes> ah
[04:07:31] <quanticle> You know I can't decide whether it'd be creepier to leave them there or take them
[04:07:38] <synthmeat> i'm a full decade into full remote and you can take it from me over my dead body
[04:07:45] <quanticle> Like, "Oh by the way, you might be haunted by ghost cats"
[04:07:45] <Logos01> I have never disintered a deceased cat.
[04:07:47] <Betawolf> it's definitely weirder to move a grave
[04:08:07] <Betawolf> it's not like an urn, after all
[04:08:17] <Logos01> The two died about a year apart from each other, so it was 3 or 4 years now they've been in the soil.
[04:08:27] <quanticle> Solution: cremate your pets
[04:08:33] <quanticle> Then you never have to deal with this question
[04:08:56] <Logos01> I mean I dug deep enough to make sure they were below the clay deposit level but their coffins were plastic-wrapped shoeboxes.
[04:09:08] <synthmeat> gwern: how long are you fully remote? :) 15 years?
[04:09:33] <gwern> maybe 12
[04:09:33] <quanticle> I mean, gwern's full time job is literally gwerning
[04:09:36] <quanticle> So...
[04:09:38] <kuudes> I have skipped now some 4 job offers because of the pandemic
[04:09:42] <Logos01> quanticle: No, the creepy bit is when you realize that when I was digging the grave of the male cat I found spinal column bones that were too large to come from a cat or dog.
[04:09:44] <synthmeat> that's a great job!
[04:09:45] <quanticle> His only boss is oolong
[04:09:55] <quanticle> synthmeat: Too bad the pay sucks
[04:10:07] <quanticle> As we quipped once, the market demand for gwerns is something like 0.8
[04:10:08] <gwern> it's an efficient market. what I lose in pay I get in fringe benefits
[04:10:08] <kuudes> Logos01, horse or human?
[04:10:17] <Logos01> kuudes: My guess is cow, actually.
[04:10:21] <kuudes> ah, indeed
[04:10:27] <kuudes> that or a pig are the things left
[04:10:37] <Logos01> It's not uncommon for people with dogs as pets to give them cow bones for cracking and marrow-sucking.
[04:10:43] <Logos01> But still.
[04:10:50] <kuudes> inhuman burial
[04:11:02] <Logos01> Inasmuch as there were non-humans buried, yes.
[04:11:15] <catern> there are lots of people at my job who really don't want to go back into the office so I think there's going to be some remote work happening
[04:11:16] <quanticle> So wait, it was like individual bones? Not arranged in any kind of skeleton?
[04:11:27] <catern> no-one on my team wants to go back in, so maybe we'll be a remote team...
[04:11:32] <Logos01> quanticle: No other parts of the skeleton were found by me.
[04:11:34] <gwern> 'Alrighty, sorry for some silence but I have a big update just deployed (and I would probably work next day or two on testing and stability): 1.

[04:11:36] <catern> quanticle: don't you work at Google? or some other bigcorp
[04:11:44] <two2thehead> oh frick me sideways
[04:11:50] <quanticle> catern: Yeah, my take is that 2-days a week WFH might become the new normal, but I don't think you'll have a lot of companies embracing 100% remote.
[04:11:55] <two2thehead> the delta variant infects most of the people in a household
[04:11:58] <Logos01> quanticle: Side note: I didn't have either of these cats euthanized. They died when they died.
[04:12:07] <quanticle> Logos01: Hopefully not in pain
[04:12:07] * two2thehead goes off to scream into his pillow
[04:12:15] <Logos01> quanticle: Well I did what I could to avoid that.
[04:12:52] <Logos01> But like ... the ragamuffin, she had brain cancer. The male cat I didn't actually find out what caused his passage. I *think* he had a stroke while I was sleeping.
[04:12:53] <catern> quanticle: I'm practicing my own indifference - to change anything at my company would require me to do a bunch of politics, and I don't care enough to do that
[04:12:59] <Logos01> It came on without warning.
[04:13:05] <quanticle> catern: I used to work for a bigcorp, but now I work for a littlecorp that is part of a bigcorp, but it still sufficiently independent to have substantial autonomy over HR policies.
[04:13:08] <shawwwn> lol. I haven't used colab in like a year
[04:13:10] <shawwwn> it's interesting.
[04:13:13] <catern> (I don't know if I really want to even leave NYC... which is the only benefit I'd have of working remote)
[04:13:22] <shawwwn> It tried to pop up "Colab is for interactive use. Are you still there?" along with a captcha
[04:13:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean
[04:13:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I live in NYC and wfh
[04:13:51] <Logos01> quanticle: So I mean ... Demon (the male cat) ... I'm pretty sure he didn't have a pleasant passage. But at least it lasted for not more than an hour or two. 
[04:13:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a benefit, I assure you
[04:14:09] <gwern> shawwwn: 'you haven't entered anything in a year. Are you alright? Do you need to talk to a GPT?'
[04:14:20] <Logos01> Which as these things go ... I couldn't have changed that outcome even if it'd begun with me right next to him, except by maybe shaving half an hour at the end off.
[04:14:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although I do like being free to leave if I want to)
[04:14:50] <quanticle> s/I want to/De Blasio fucks the city hard enough/
[04:15:06] <shawwwn> gwern: ironically, it's because GPT-J was compressed
[04:15:06] <Logos01> But anyhoo.  The new carrier is weird-ish because the sides expand to little cloth cages that open up into the main carrier in such a way that the divider can be made into flooring.

[04:15:19] <Logos01> Or you can use it to actually keep critters separated but in the same carrier.
[04:15:24] <feepbot> Google Colaboratory
[04:15:28] <shawwwn> gwern: they have a .tar.zstd model checkpoint distributed by The Eye
[04:15:42] <shawwwn> it downloads ~8GB in 3min, which is no biggie. But it's been taking forever to un-compress
[04:15:51] <shawwwn> well, 4 minutes. I guess that wasn't that bad
[04:16:07] <shawwwn> but yeah, 3 min + 4 min was enough to trip colab's "Are you bitcoin mining?" filter
[04:17:29] <Logos01> The fact that I can, if necessary, carry both cats in the same carrier (with a touch of ingenuity) is what led me to purchase the new carrier.
[04:17:52] <Logos01> I just need to cut out some cardboard or stiff foam rubber to act as a bottom for the smaller cat to be kept in the side compartment.

[04:24:33] <shawwwn> it's hard to see, but, along the bottom, it gives you a breakdown of the current call stack
[04:24:38] <ggreer> because it's always been that way
[04:24:52] <ggreer> also you do miss certain things in remote environments, especially if not everyone is remote
[04:25:20] <kuudes> the place before last we also had self decided location - sometimes on site, sometimes from home, sometimes from our company's site, sometimes on customer's site...

[04:29:14] <kuudes> why not call
[04:29:38] <ggreer> video chat isn't as good as in person. there's latency that prevents interrupting
[04:29:42] <catern> I've been happy to see people learning basic IRC ettiquette like "don't PM people when you can talk in the channel" and "don't ask to ask"
[04:29:46] <ggreer> also most video chat software favors the first person to talk
[04:29:46] <kuudes> no video, audio
[04:30:38] <kuudes> and I don't think teams has that much of lag O_o
[04:30:55] <ggreer> even 100ms is a ton of lag compared to real life
[04:31:03] <kuudes> I don't think it has that much
[04:31:43] <catern> one thing that's been nice: I've had fewer meetings during remote work
[04:32:04] <kuudes> and if you are audio + screensharing only, why would it have audio lag?
[04:32:42] <Logos01> catern: People are a lot more willing to just use the company chat, even though videochat is hardly any more effort.

[04:33:07] <Logos01> I guess it's a kind of general "The other person is probably not wearing pants" consensus of what constitutes proper courtesy on these things.
[04:33:35] <kuudes> I ask with a teams message before calling usually unless it is really urgent
[04:33:58] <catern> Logos01: well, video chat is substantially worse than text in many respects
[04:34:06] <kuudes> ... why use video
[04:34:08] <ggreer> if you're recording video at 60fps (which is usually not the case. video chat is typically 30fps or lower), that's 16ms to grab a frame. probably another 16ms to encode the frame. then there's network latency (anywhere from 10ms to 300ms depending where people are in the world). then another 16ms to paint the frame (and most compositing window managers do double buffering so add another 16ms)
[04:34:16] <kuudes> you are both looking at the code or presentation in any case
[04:34:26] <ggreer> 16 + 16 + 10 + 16 + 16 is 74ms
[04:34:29] <kuudes> we don't use video most ever
[04:34:37] <ggreer> and that's if you have a perfect setup
[04:34:49] <kuudes> everyone is within 1000 km of each other
[04:34:57] <kuudes> and the server is at the general company
[04:35:11] <ggreer> I used an example with 10ms network latency
[04:35:15] <kuudes> latency is less than 5 ms
[04:35:22] <kuudes> why do you have slow network
[04:35:41] <adiabatic> wifi?
[04:35:43] <kuudes> don't
[04:35:46] <kuudes> wires
[04:35:59] <adiabatic> I'm a wires fan too, but not everyone can all the time
[04:35:59] <ggreer> ok assume 5ms round trip latency. that's now 71ms latency total
[04:36:09] <ggreer> *69ms
[04:36:28] <kuudes> and as said: why video
[04:36:30] <kuudes> use audio only.
[04:36:38] <kuudes> seriously
[04:36:39] <ggreer> even if you have a perfect network, there is a lot of hardware and software involved
[04:37:17] <ggreer> you need video to judge facial reactions
[04:37:37] <ggreer> we're comparing to real life, where we have things like body language and eye contact
[04:37:51] <kuudes> I have not used video most any time in last 3 years
[04:38:03] <adiabatic> it's nice to be muted on a group call (because clicky keyboard) and still be able to nod or give thumbs-ups
[04:38:10] <kuudes> and we didn't use video in the 2 years in the job before
[04:38:24] <ggreer> so you're missing out. also audio latency is similar. it takes time to capture audio, encode it, send it across the network, decode it, and output it
[04:38:31] <ggreer> if you have bluetooth headphones you're adding 100ms of latency
[04:38:35] <kuudes> don't
[04:38:38] <catern> adiabatic: you can do that with text easily too
[04:38:50] <kuudes> phones do this all the time
[04:38:54] <adiabatic> sure but I hate pressing command-tab to do that
[04:39:05] <catern> just have your conversation entirely in text :)
[04:39:07] <adiabatic> and who knows what the most recent app is gonna be, really
[04:39:16] <ggreer> phones have terrible latency. the old circuit-switched landline network was far better
[04:39:16] <adiabatic> too much typing, fuck that
[04:39:17] <kuudes> you are in a meeting.
[04:39:25] <kuudes> what
[04:39:30] <catern> adiabatic: you're on IRC!
[04:39:53] <kuudes> does your gsm call have 100ms latency in usa?
[04:39:58] <catern> (maybe the real remote work game changer is really reliable text to speech?)

[04:40:26] <Robomot> What color is a mirror? It's not a trick question (Mirrors aren't 'silver' or 'colorless'.)
[04:40:43] <ggreer> kuudes: no, which is why people prefer in-person meetings to shitty-sounding laggy phone calls
[04:41:02] <kuudes> gwern, is it related to ideal sun color is green or something
[04:41:03] <ggreer> on most OSes, simply playing audio to a hard-wired speaker takes a good 20ms
[04:41:04] <kuudes> ggreer, ?
[04:41:31] <kuudes> you mean your gsm takes more than 100 ms?
[04:41:41] <kuudes> just how bad comms do you guys have

[04:42:47] <kuudes> do you or do you not have noticeable lag in usa when you call another person with a mobile phone?
[04:42:59] <ggreer> yes. everyone does.
[04:43:02] <kuudes> no
[04:43:04] <kuudes> no they don't
[04:43:07] <ggreer> cell phones digitize the signal and send it over a packet-switched network. old landlines had a physical circuit
[04:43:13] <kuudes> your system just sucks even more than I realized
[04:43:20] <kuudes> indeed, but no
[04:43:25] <adiabatic> kuudes: happy to know we're getting through to you :P
[04:43:32] <ggreer> no. the GSM-AMR spec chunks everything into 20ms frames
[04:43:32] <galambo_> http://www.tlmc.eu/2021/06/there-are-no-good-browsers-left.html
[04:43:32] <Robomot> Touhou lossless music collection: There are no good browsers left. (I actually intended to make this post a year or two ago, but then kept putting it off. Now I stopped doing that, so here you are.  What is t...)
[04:43:34] <kuudes> the cell system opens you a dedicated path for your packets
[04:43:47] <ggreer> this is part of the spec. you can't have less than 20ms latency
[04:43:48] <kuudes> they don't go over the regular internt
[04:43:59] <kuudes> sure, but 20ms << 100 ms
[04:44:09] <ggreer> it encodes the sound wave into 160 samples over 20ms
[04:44:29] <ggreer> that's the minimum time it takes to encode. that doesn't count for transmitting or decoding and playing
[04:44:46] <kuudes> well ping over the mobile channel is minimal
[04:45:05] <ggreer> you have to transmit the frame over a network, then decode it (another 20ms), then play it (usually with >20ms latency on a modern smartphone)
[04:45:08] <kuudes> you certainly don't use 80 ms to decode and encode
[04:45:13] <kuudes> not general network
[04:45:16] <ggreer> for a total of around 60ms latency assuming no network delay
[04:45:17] <kuudes> telcos network
[04:45:32] <ggreer> you don't remember what circuit switched telephony was like
[04:45:34] <kuudes> and telco interconnect network
[04:45:49] <kuudes> mobile phones certainly don't have 100 ms lag here.
[04:45:56] <kuudes> but I can believe anything of usa these days
[04:46:21] <catern> (it's not implausible that Finnish telcos use a circuit switched backhaul I guess)
[04:46:45] <kuudes> surely no reasonable telco does otherwise, catern
[04:46:56] <ggreer> catern: how? they'd have to turn it back to analog, then re-encode at the other cell tower
[04:47:06] <kuudes> what
[04:47:09] <catern> ggreer: there are circuit switch digital networks
[04:47:39] <ggreer> that would be pretty wasteful. why not just run a single optical fiber instead of a bunch of wires for each conversation?
[04:47:59] <kuudes> base stations indeed have optical fiber
[04:48:02] <ggreer> I could see it being a transitional thing, but not something telcos would keep up with now that everything's digital
[04:48:13] <kuudes> and landlines also get converted to digital in their first connection
[04:48:21] <ggreer> yes. and they used to *not* have that happen
[04:48:26] <ggreer> and it was a very different experience
[04:48:38] <kuudes> you get a pipe from one phone to another where the latency is millis or less
[04:49:19] <ggreer> people notice typing latency on the order of 40ms. they're going to notice audio latency much lower than that
[04:52:50] <catern> ggreer: circuit switching just means that you set up an end-to-end route up front, and allocate a fixed amount of bandwidth at each node, you don't need one-wire-per-connection, you can still multiplex multiple connections over a single wire
[04:53:27] <kuudes> even data in 4g should have less than 100 ms latency
[04:53:35] <kuudes> what catern said
[04:55:12] <catern> kuudes: I am skeptical though because the incentives aren't there for telcos to set up a good low-latency network - packet switching is cheaper purely because that's what everyone else is doing
[04:55:26] <catern> but this is an empirical question about Finland, not something that can be determined through Pure Reason
[04:55:29] <kuudes> we have beauty competition licence in finland
[04:55:39] <kuudes> ie the licence fees are nominal and they select for best quality
[04:56:13] <kuudes> phones are not luxury items here and are not specifically taxed
[04:56:58] <kuudes> and the communications office has power to order where wires are drawn and where base station posts are placed and what prices are, in case markets don't solve things
[04:57:22] <kuudes> usually it is enough that they threaten with "we have noticed market in X may not be working, and will be checking in 3 months if it has started to work"
[04:57:44] <kuudes> but house owner has duty to allow base stations on their houses etc if orderedd
[04:57:49] <shawwwn> nshepperd / RiversHaveWings: thinking about grad clipping. It seems like “clip” is the wrong word — the correct operation should be, “if the grad is too extreme, ignore it” for each parameter. Agree/disagree?
[04:58:41] <shawwwn> For example, if a parameter was going to apply a grad of 3.5, but you clip to 0.5, then that parameter shouldn’t change at all
[04:58:42] <kuudes> this was sort of the expectation when developing the tech in comms - but many locales, especially usa, had some sort of vested interests to make everything really bad
[04:58:51] <gwern> I think people sometimes mean different things when they say 'gradient clipping'. sometimes they mean ceiling/truncation, setting a max. in a few cases like... nd-vae? dall-e? they do in fact mean 'round to 0 or drop the gradient entirely'
[04:59:12] <shawwwn> Round to 0?
[04:59:57] <gwern> you can see it as a prior on whether a large gradient is merely *exaggerated* or *outright wrong*
[05:00:54] <shawwwn> I don’t know what round to 0 means
[05:01:01] <gwern> (if it's exaggerated, clipping is a simple way to shrink it back towards the mean and improve the gradient approximation error. if it's drawn from a distribution of wrongness, and is totally uninformative, then you want to avoid it entirely)
[05:01:34] <shawwwn> It seems to me that your options are: apply the gradient; or ignore the gradient.
[05:01:42] <shawwwn> It makes no sense to modify the gradient
[05:01:50] <gwern> it makes tons of sense. think of it in bayesian terms 
[05:01:54] <shawwwn> Not on a per parameter basis
[05:02:17] <gwern> an extreme measurement, taken with approximation/error (and a minibatch means the gradient has a lot of approximation/error) regresses to to the mean

[05:02:43] *** Joins: tomzx (~tomzx@ivysaur.umbreon.net)
[05:02:48] <shawwwn> It might be fine to rescale the gradients globally, so that the maximum falls within a certain threshold. But not per parameter
[05:02:53] <gwern> massaging the gradient is a great idea. look at Adam. you don't just apply the raw gradient yolo. you massage it based on the history
[05:03:24] <shawwwn> Yes, that’s true. But that’s a principled approach.
[05:03:32] <gwern> a gradient from a minibatch is just that minibatch's, like, opinion, man
[05:03:34] <shawwwn> It’s not “just clip the gradient whenever I feel like it”
[05:04:00] <gwern> well, it's not 'when you feel like it'. it's another hyperparameter which needs to be tuned
[05:04:25] <shawwwn> Or, you can simply ignore the gradient, the way we ignore it in stop loss
[05:04:45] <shawwwn> Seems way more robust and more likely to converge to the right solution
[05:04:49] <gwern> yes, but that's another hyperparameter - at what hard threshold do you abruptly switch from applying it naively, to ignoring it?
[05:05:23] <gwern> surely god loves the minibatch with a loss of 0.4999999 almost as much as he loves the minibatch with a loss of 0.50000...

[05:07:21] <shawwwn> It’s not optimal. Ive seen evidence that different values are better for different tasks. But
[05:07:31] <shawwwn> That’s beside the question of “ignore, or clip?”
[05:07:40] <shawwwn> I think this clips, not ignores
[05:08:18] <shawwwn> And surely if it’s an extreme gradient, it can’t make sense to just clip it naively. It will do something, sure
[05:08:25] <shawwwn> But it might end up further away from the solution

[05:34:14] <shawwwn> RiversHaveWings: I have no idea to be honest

[05:34:57] <shawwwn> Which seems crazy to me.
[05:35:00] <RiversHaveWings> why?
[05:35:41] <RiversHaveWings> isn't zeroing the gradient for that parameter if it's out-of-range also crazy? you just changed the direction of the gradient! now you don't have the gradient anymore!
[05:37:01] <RiversHaveWings> btw L2 loss with its gradient clipped has a name, it's called the Huber loss
[05:37:14] <gwern> it might be used elsewhere, like the optimizer
[05:37:30] <gwern> eg a learned optimizer could see a zeroed gradient as a useful signal

In the world of Vivy, it's not Isaac Asimov's Three Laws that dictate an AI's behavior, but rather a single mission that forms the core of their existence. For Diva, it is to make everyone happy with her singing. What gets Diva to agree to help Matsumoto is that, for everyone “to be made happy...
[07:05:43] <gwern> ...with her singing,” they must naturally be alive. Thus, Diva finds herself carrying out objective after objective that she was not designed for.' <-- 'i have no mouth and i must sing'

[07:24:43] <nshepperd2> to deliver an insult to the CA power grid?
[07:24:47] <ggreer> though even at the most expensive stations, charging from 0% to 100% is never more than $30
[07:24:50] <ggreer> it's during off-peak hours
[07:25:09] <ggreer> > Before 12 p.m. and after 9 p.m.
[07:26:23] <adiabatic> why would a weekend day tax the grid especially
[07:26:34] <adiabatic> nobody's at the office
[07:26:50] <nshepperd2> perhaps you could consider it foreign aid
[07:27:52] <gwern> hm. load-shedding? they expect lots of travel and that to cause problems like customer dissatisfaction at clogged chargers en route to destinations?
[07:28:14] <ggreer> probably
[07:28:19] <gwern> or they might trip some sort of power grid limit if everyone shows up for holiday weekend and they exceed X megawatts during the day
[07:28:21] <adiabatic> also weird: peak times here are from 4p to 9p according to my energy company
[07:29:04] <gwern> so you push people to the morning/late-evening to try to avoid the afternoon... and making it free winds up being cheaper than crashing in the afternoon
[07:29:44] <adiabatic> that would make sense. who arrives at a july 4 bbq so far before noon that his car is charged up by the end of it
[07:30:03] <ggreer> I think a lot of the CA superchargers have big ol batteries to reduce peak draw on the grid

[11:11:58] <nshepperd2> i think after this clip-vqgan-gpt trains i'll do an upscaler
[11:12:26] <nshepperd2> seems like it should actually be really easy
[11:13:41] <nshepperd2> take a 256x256 patch, downscale it to 128x128, encode both to tokens, feed [small, large] into gpt
[11:14:37] <nshepperd2> when upscaling a pic, you just do it patch by patch, doing conditional sampling where the patches overlap so that the borders match up
[11:15:13] <PapuaHardyNet> you'll feed a tokenized version of a picture into a transformer?
[11:15:24] <nshepperd2> yeah
[11:15:36] <PapuaHardyNet> how will that help? you have converted a picture into 1D, losing spatial feature data
[11:15:49] <PapuaHardyNet> I fail to see the usecase
[11:15:52] <nshepperd2> not really
[11:16:04] <nshepperd2> the tokenization uses convolution
[11:16:15] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, I see
[11:16:32] <nshepperd2> and a trained position embedding can easily represent 2 dimensions
[11:16:48] <nshepperd2> this is how my image generator works already

[16:34:52] <PapuaHardyNet> here's an interesting thought experiment: you are locked in a room with a SCP like monster, who constantly tries to get a reaction from you and therefore make you acknowledge their presence. If you do acknowledge their presence, they kill you. The only way to stay alive is to never acknowledge their presence no matter what
[16:35:41] <PapuaHardyNet> how can one maximize their chances of survival, assuming that they only need to stay in this room for a finite amount of time as part of an experiment?
[16:37:44] <PapuaHardyNet> easy mode: the monster only has access to your outside actions to tell whether you are aware of them or acknowledge them. hard mode: they can read your thoughts
[16:38:20] <dbohdan> Easy mode: take a hypnotic drug and sleep through the experiment
[16:38:25] <dbohdan> Hard mode: you're dead
[16:38:50] <dbohdan> There is no way you won't think of the monster in some way

[16:41:00] <PapuaHardyNet> my first thoughts are vipassana meditation, but that requires someone to be fairly proficient at it
[16:41:09] <dbohdan> If it's a few minutes, you can use heavy distractions like a VR helmet or meditate.  Maybe both: a VR guided meditation.
[16:41:41] <PapuaHardyNet> all right! Now we are talking. VR is something I didn't think of entirely
[16:42:31] <PapuaHardyNet> so yes, in summary, meditation or fantasy as distraction (via VR), or both at the same time
[16:45:00] <dbohdan> You can have a lesser threat trying to attack or even kill you.  Dodging it will distract you.
[16:45:35] <dbohdan> Ideally, getting distracted for more than a few seconds would result in a successful and painful attack
[16:46:31] <dbohdan> If you have another person with you there in the same situation, the two of you can fight or fuck

[23:48:41] <Logos01> "Murray believes that Christianity is essential because secularists have been thus far totally incapable of creating an ethic of equality that matches the concept that all human beings are created in the image of God."
[23:48:47] <Logos01> That's some of the dumbest shit I've ever read.

[23:50:09] <Logos01> Or of the concept of 'inherent dignity of sophoncy' -- but I'll let that latter one slide since most people haven't heard of sapient let alone sophont.

[23:50:44] <Logos01> Jayson_Virissimo: No, it's measurably sillier.
[23:51:03] <Logos01> Jayson_Virissimo: Because there's Judaism the religion and Hebrew the ethnicity, and both are referred to as Jews.
[23:51:19] <saturn2> rawlsianism makes no more sense than christianity. probably less
[23:51:23] <Logos01> But there's only Christianity the religion and no "${X}" the ethnicity to which one can say "both are referred to as Christians".
[23:51:43] <Logos01> saturn2: What, the veil of ignorance as an "ethic of equality"?  How do you figure?
[23:52:44] <Logos01> I mean it doesn't stand on its own as a complete ethical framework, sure, but it's a pretty decent metric for vetting the egalitarianism of any *actual* ethical framework.
[23:53:01] <Jayson_Virissimo> Logos01: nope, there are many ethnically inflected Christianities
[23:53:20] <Jayson_Virissimo> Think Russian/Greek Orthodox, etc...
[23:53:25] <saturn2> there's no veil of ignorance, it's just something he made up. and there's not even any backstory to help dodge the obvious questions
[23:54:01] <Jayson_Virissimo> Those denominations *just are* part of their culture.
[23:54:10] <saturn2> you can't say "rawls works in mysterious ways" or "everything is part of rawls's plan"
[23:54:37] <feep> uh, that's an advantage
[23:54:50] <feep> the point of the veil of ignorance is that it appeals to our aesthetic preference for generalization
[23:54:50] <Logos01> Jayson_Virissimo: You can be any of those ethnicities without being or maintaining any Christian practices at all. You *can't* maintain Hebrew cultural ethnicity without maintaining Jewish practices.

[23:57:26] <Logos01> Oh here's another gem from this "Murray" person in that article:  "On a recent podcast, he was more blunt: “The sanctity of human life is a Judeo-Christian notion which might very easily not survive [the disappearance of] Judeo-Christian civilisation.”"
[23:57:38] <Logos01> Strictly speaking his statement *is* true.
[23:57:51] <Logos01> The sanctity of human -- and *only* -- human life is a Judeo-Christian notion.
[23:58:06] <saturn2> yeah, sola scriptura is why we ended up here in the first place
[23:58:07] <Logos01> The idea of all life having sanctity however comes from multiple cultures.

[23:58:22] <feep> judeo-christian values are a post-enlightenment historical fiction :v
[23:58:49] <ggreer> judeo-christian values like torturing heretics instead of killing them. oh and enslaving people
[23:58:58] <Jayson_Virissimo> Logos01: You can drop any particular religion practice and remain those ethnicities, true. But, dropping all of them, you have removed many of the things that make those ethnicities distinctive, so it is only a matter of degree IMO, which is why I think the analogy with "secular Jew" more-or-less works.
[23:59:01] <Logos01> And the *modern* secularist notion of the inherent dignity/value or moral-weight of living feeling creatures being at least proportionately allocated on how close to sapience they are is deeply anti-Christian.
[23:59:06] <feep> like that meme comic with "You made this? I made this."
[23:59:32] <ggreer> oh and the death penalty for crimes. that's another important judeo-christian value
