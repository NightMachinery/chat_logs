[00:27:02] <tester12> how can I convert number with leading zero to integer number like this: $a='07' convert to 7 integer number

[00:32:58] <TML> No

[10:42:53] <toretto> i'm curious what you guys do for newsletter management? i've never delt with news letter managements, and i'd be also be adding no attachments. so, i thought of have a mysql table for all the email addresses that are subscribed to the newsletter, and use google's gmail SMTP service for my email handling(since hosting own email server and configuring it is a pain in the ass) and every once in the while, if i
[10:42:59] <toretto> need to send an update to all those subscribed email addresses, i'd be looping through the email addresses in the table and using PHP's `mail()` or PHPMailer for sending that email to the newsletter email IDs. is this good enough for basic purpose? this is something which came to my mind instantly, but not sure what other professional prople do.(other than the ones who use some paid solutions).

[11:16:20] <Byteflux> toretto: 1) Google doesn't want you using their SMTP for automated services. 2) There are mail sending service providers specifically for that, some with generous limits on their free plans. 3) Do what everyone else does and use an email marketing service for managing newsletters and other promotional emails.
[11:17:21] <toretto> ah, yeah. i don't think i can push a shit ton of bulk email through gmail SMTP servers.
[11:17:37] <toretto> i shoulda thought about that.
[11:17:47] <Byteflux> If #3 for whatever reason is not an option, then you only realistically have #2. Then you won't be dealing with crap like mail(), you only need to use the provider's API.
[11:19:13] <toretto> but yeah, for pushing bulk emails, i guess i'd use email marketing or some thing. i'll also look into the email providers with high push limits.
[11:19:43] <biberu> toretto: careful that you don't get an important domain spam flagged while experimenting with this
[11:20:13] <toretto> i thought of managing my own email servers, but sending emails to gmail is super hard, i've to setup bunch of security records lasttime, so i guess i'd go for #2 or #3
[11:20:58] <Byteflux> Note that #2 and #3 specifically distinguishes between a service provider who sends your emails for you (using your own domain), you still have to craft all the emails and call their API for delivery. #3 is using a provider that specializes in newsletters and email marketing in general, you still would use their API but they handle all the boring bits of building a newsletter system, analytics, automation etc.
[11:25:17] <Byteflux> For #2, I've had good results with MailGun.
[11:25:44] <Byteflux> They used to have a much more generous free plan at the time, though. Seems like they've clamped it down considerably as they grew.

[19:00:50] <arash> Hello, what is the correct syntax of this code : $e = "$output['buy_usd']['price']"; ? I want to have the value of $output['buy_usd'] in a string.
[19:03:32] <AllenJB> arash: There's at least 3 options to achieve that: https://3v4l.org/
[19:03:43] <AllenJB> oops: https://3v4l.org/b1pNv
[19:06:17] <arash> AllenJB, thank you. $e = "{$output['buy_usd']['price']}"; i was looking for that, i tried $output{['buy_usd']} and didn't work
[19:07:11] <biberu> arash: is price a number that should actually be formatted?
[19:08:53] <biberu> arash: e.g. thousands grouping, decimal symbol, number of decimals..?
[19:09:05] <biberu> it's odd to just cast something that appears to be money to a string
[19:09:56] <da_wunder> I would just use some library like - https://github.com/moneyphp/money
[19:11:26] <arash> biberu, then what is your suggestion ? Its some kind of test actually. nothing important. just want to echo that value. also i think its already formatted.
[19:11:49] <biberu> if it's already formatted then what's the point of the cast?
[19:12:35] <biberu> ah, you just wanted to use it in a string
[19:12:59] <biberu> i got confused by that (string) in one of the 3v4ls :)
[19:15:18] *** Quits: fahrradToken (~fahrradTo@ip5f59f4f3.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:15:41] <arash> biberu, the point is concatenation. and the main point is to receive the information from api and then send it to a ajax call, because of "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" can't send request directly in JavaScript
[19:16:33] <biberu> arash: ah, ok
[19:28:05] <FightingFalcon> 			$this->content = str_replace( '<script>', "<script nonce='$csp_nonce'>", $this->content );
[19:28:05] <FightingFalcon> 			$this->content = str_replace( '<script ', "<script nonce='$csp_nonce' ", $this->content );
[19:28:13] <FightingFalcon> How would you write this shorter?
[19:28:32] <FightingFalcon> so that it will replace both <script> and <script whahtever here
[19:29:03] <da_wunder> you could define those as an array in str_replace
[19:29:40] <Naktibalda> preg_replace could be shorter
[19:30:46] <pmercado> is there a way to restart nginx gracefuly , recently changed php.ini
[19:31:14] <Naktibalda> are you sure that you want to restart nginx and not php-fpm?
[19:31:40] <Byteflux> then you should be restarting php-fpm
[19:35:03] <Byteflux> FightingFalcon: $this->content = preg_replace('/<script\b/', "<script nonce=\"$csb_notice\"", $this->content);
[19:35:11] <Byteflux> $csp_none*
[19:35:17] <Byteflux> nonce lol. misread your variable
[19:35:27] <FightingFalcon> thanks a lot
[19:36:01] <Byteflux> Simple pattern to match <script as a word boundary so it should also work with edge cases instead of just '>' or ' ', such as line breaks.
[19:38:26] <pmercado> are not the same? first time using nginx
[19:38:55] <pmercado> if I change php.ini I need to restart php-fpm ?
[19:39:03] <Byteflux> yes
[19:39:32] <Byteflux> nginx is just a reverse proxy, it plays no part in interacting with php.ini, that's php-fpm's job.
[19:41:16] <pmercado> oh thanks

[20:48:52] <__adrian> yeah, not sure how ws figure into your question at all. sounds like you might just want to proxy a request to a different api.
[20:48:55] <celphi> 3 sites: site1 sends an ajax call to site2 (but site2 is just a site that formats the request into proper format) which sends it to site3. site3 process it, then replies with response and only then can site2 finally give the site1 the response
[20:49:20] <__adrian> yeah, so how do websockets figure into that?
[20:49:40] <celphi> i have a way i can do it with websockets but it's not php discussion
[20:49:51] <Naktibalda> there is no need for websockets at all
[20:50:06] <celphi> so it's possible to do then?
[20:50:18] <__adrian> right, just mentioning ws makes me think there's more to your question. but if there's not, then sure, you can do that.
[20:50:28] <Naktibalda> <?php echo $client->get('site2');
[20:50:36] <__adrian> it would probably be really crappy slow, but you can do it
[20:50:50] <celphi> yeah slow is my concern
[20:51:04] <celphi> that's why websocket would prob be best way
[20:51:05] <__adrian> is the second api yours?
[20:51:09] <Naktibalda> how slow?
[20:51:12] <__adrian> what?
[20:51:18] <celphi> yes - but cant modify the 2nd api
[20:51:32] <celphi> 2nd api requires a specific format
[20:52:04] <celphi> so 1st api just does validation/authorization and gets reply from api2
[20:52:14] <Naktibalda> if it takes less than 10 seconds, there is no need to think about making it async
[20:52:45] <celphi> it's after typing in an adddress it populates fields
[20:52:58] <celphi> and another one with vin number populates fields
[20:53:47] <celphi> i can do with websockets but if just using curl works fast enough id rather go that route
[20:53:52] <Naktibalda> have you asked your hosting if you are allowed to run daemons?
[20:54:04] <celphi> its aws
[20:54:16] <Naktibalda> then use aws lambda
[20:54:51] <celphi> not fmailiar with it- but ill check it out
[20:55:24] <Naktibalda> haven't you said that you aren't allowed to run anything else then PHP?
