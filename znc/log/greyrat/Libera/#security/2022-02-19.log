[01:19:49] <ajak> i'm not sure if you're paying attention but these zeroclicks tend to be compromising the device itself then having access to whatever the device has access to
[01:20:06] <ajak> so really not signal being compromised

[01:23:48] <ajak> very good logic there
[01:23:53] <Evolver> Signal and WhatsApp have vulnerabilities
[01:23:55] <opcode> those zeroclick exploits are basically automated evil maid attacks
[01:24:12] <opcode> if signal could defend against them, you wouldn't be able to read your chats

[02:22:48] <rm-rf> For starters: Zram swap vs. standard swap. Pros and cons?

[02:23:44] <rm-rf> Yeah, fuck Linux ... even though I have a Linux t-shirt on right now that says "Linux Powered"
[02:23:59] <Klinda> linux is only for coding only

[02:24:17] <rm-rf> You come to the holy den of Linux and blaspheme.
[02:24:22] <Klinda> I buy a rtx 3090

[02:25:24] <Klinda> very bad
[02:25:27] <rm-rf> You have to hack the shit, in many cases, to get stuff like nvidia to work. Linus Torvalds hates Nvidia
[02:25:31] <rm-rf> Let me find that funny meme
[02:26:10] <rm-rf> Where do I upload images?
[02:26:29] <Klinda> the only good thing about linux is that coding is really good at least my expirience
[02:26:39] <Klinda> of course if you are a hacker you should know linux
[02:26:42] <rm-rf> Yeah, so on Linux, talking real and not just being silly or inane as I have been. I don't see the Windows v. Linux things as black-and-white.

[02:27:27] <rm-rf> *had to modify the swap

[02:28:27] <Mathisen> yeah
[02:28:30] <rm-rf> Oh, I misread. Right
[02:28:30] <ajak> luks and swap really aren't related concepts at all
[02:28:46] <rm-rf> Yeah, I'm gonna say they are since the encrypted partition has its own swap
[02:28:47] <Mathisen> indeed what ajak said
[02:28:51] <ajak> yeah i think ubuntu fsck's on boot
[02:28:57] <Klinda> I remeber when they talked to me about team teso, w0w0w0, delirium. the insults on theo de raadt

[02:29:23] <Klinda> but in the end I was a noob
[02:29:45] <rm-rf> K, so type cat /proc/swaps.
[02:30:00] <rm-rf> If you did full disk encryption, you have one swap that says something like /dev/dm-2
[02:30:11] <Klinda> but what's the problem with swap?
[02:30:12] <ajak> not necessarily
[02:30:16] <rm-rf> That's the swap on the encrypted drive. If you add more, the new swap isn't on the encrypted partition
[02:30:19] <rm-rf> *partition - not drive
[02:30:48] <rm-rf> And I shouldn't argue if people say I'm wrong. Egos should be dropped - my ego that is. Too many huge egos in IT and security.

[04:35:03] <moniker-> hey something caught my attention, was half sleepnig and decided to activate windows narrator to read webpage
[04:35:33] <moniker-> if you think about it, windows can read anything from screen, it can even scroll webpage and read it... that means it has access to literally everything on every website
[04:35:56] <moniker-> isn't this security issue or is this sorted somehow?
[04:36:23] <moniker-> or at least privacy issue

[04:39:23] <moniker-> recently started using an app on android that changes screen pixel colors which fixes ghosting on old screen, and then noticed that google's android playstore refuses to install an app while another 3rd party app has access to overlay on top of other apps presumably because it can read anything, so every time i wanna install something i need to disable this app

[20:05:28] <Alex948> ajak: I agree, this rabbit hole goes quite deep. I was just asking for advice in #ubuntu about how to encrypted my entire drive so that nobody could steal the drive and read my data. I follow a full disk encryption guide on the Ubuntu docs. In the end, the main advice was that this is overly complicated and that it make sense to just leave /boot

So I wondered if I had missed any places where sensitive files could be stored unencrypted, such as swap / temp directories / hibernation images. In a way, it just feels "too
[20:15:37] <Alex948> easy"? Like, is that REALLY secure or did I miss any places? And I don't trust my own skills enough to evaluate the security of such a system, as I believe security and encryption is incredibly hard to get right without leaving holes open for (side channel) attacks
