[06:46:07] <Guest81> how do the linux installers work? do they apply a pre configured image to the partitions?
[06:46:20] <[666]> i copied an install from old HDD to new SSD. Old HDD was 2TB while new SSD is 120GB. total filesize of install is 19GB. du only shows the 19GB but df reports that the SSD is 100% full.
[06:46:56] <Blondie101010> Guest81:  there's no law or rule on how they do it, but that is abnormal
[06:47:12] <[666]> would there be a large file that isn't reported by du in /proc that copied from the HDD to SSD that's filling it?
[06:47:26] <Guest81> how do the standard distros do it? Blondie101010
[06:47:37] <Blondie101010> they install everything
[06:47:56] <Guest81> like do they have a rootfs image and apply that?
[06:48:05] <TJ-> [666]:  did you clone the HDD image, or create new file-systems on the SSD and copy files into it?
[06:48:18] <Blondie101010> [666]:  /proc is not a regular FS
[06:48:22] <keir> Guest81: the basis of most distros is a package manager. the package manager installs the files
[06:48:24] <Blondie101010> do not copy it
[06:48:51] <Guest81> keir I meant fresh installing of the system
[06:48:57] <Guest81> not the packages
[06:49:09] <keir> Guest81: yes but an installer mostly just installs the package manager and then gets the package manager to install what's needed
[06:49:34] <Guest81> like in windows installer, dism just applies install.wim file to a partition
[06:50:00] <Guest81> keir yes but that does require a base system
[06:50:10] <Guest81> how is the base system installed?
[06:50:12] <[666]> hmm. that's probably my error. i did not see how dd would work from a 2TB > 120GB drive so, yeah, I did recreate the fs and dirs and then copy over using a live distro TJ-
[06:50:34] <keir> Guest81: by the package manager... on arch linux the package is literally called "base"
[06:50:35] <Blondie101010> Guest81:  I don't understand your restrictive reasoning
[06:50:37] <TJ-> Guest81: Ubuntu installers copy the installer image into the target, then hook up the boot-loader
[06:50:55] <Blondie101010> the installer creates the partitions, formats them, then installs each module needed
[06:51:20] <TJ-> [666] clone would have been the /wrong/ way to do it - copying files into new file-system would be the preferred way, but it may depend on how and what you actually copied.

[06:51:31] <Guest81> ?
[06:51:32] <Menzador> Guest81: Well, ofc, we don't exactly use DISM, but instead, what we do is that we have pacman install the "base" group, like keir said, that expands the base dirs into the partition, but pacman runs specifically outside of the partition...
[06:51:52] <TJ-> Guest81: the 'root file-system' in the installer ISO file
[06:51:56] <Blondie101010> Guest81:  the installer image itself is indeed an image

[06:52:22] <Guest81> so the rootfs is like a package

[06:52:54] <Blondie101010> some installers will download packages as needed

[07:09:09] <TJ-> [666]: because in a running system the kernel file-systems will mask any files that were put inside the mountpoint
[07:09:09] <TJ-> [666]: e.g: "mkdir /mnt/rootfs; mount --bind / /mnt/rootfs; du -s /mnt/rootfs/proc  /mnt/rootfs/dev /mnt/rootfs/sys " -- if those last 3 have a lot of space used, then you likely need to delete files from them. You'd need to explore them to see what is there

[09:00:56] <very_sneaky> i'm running a gitlab instance behind a reverse proxy that i'm using for both proxying reuqests to the gitlab instance and also SSL termination. When i try to interact with it over SSH, i get refused 22, because obviously ssh'ing to gitlab.example.com resolves to the reverse proxy and not the actual gitlab instance - is there a good way to approach this without just bypassing the reverse proxy
[09:00:59] <very_sneaky> altogther? I'd prefer to maintain the reverse proxy for ssl termination because it makes managing certs a lot easier for a large number of services

[16:32:54] <katp32> given that gitlab won't even load without cookies enabled, I'm not particularly enticed by that link ;D
[16:33:28] <arahael> koollman: Ah, interesting.
[16:33:39] <rahl> katp32: Am I now part of a dieing breed that still wants the focus to be on "do one thing and do it well" (not dogmatically, but considerably more than I'm seeing atm)
[16:33:41] <jason1234> katp32: we are using openbsd servers, we are concerned by our liberties -- more than linux users.
[16:34:14] <TJ-> rahl: I just counted the 'essential' directories and got: "files=7886 lines=4994952" -- that is using "find ./fs ./kernel ./net ./block ./crypto ./ipc ./lib ./mm ./sound  -type f  ..."
[16:34:14] <rahl> jason1234: I think the only thing that held me back on bsd a few years ago was some lack in drivers iirc
[16:34:23] <katp32> rahl: yes, sadly :(

[16:37:27] <arahael> koollman: Hmm. "systemd done right".  So they want all the stuff systemd does? :)
[16:37:47] <tahc> dir has the same exact options as ls does on linux. Is dir even it's own separate program or is it just a symlink to ls?

[16:41:28] <koollman> arahael: the author also wrote a kind of scripting language called 'execline'. The code is quite pleasant to read through, and the ability to compose rather complex init things with it is rather nice. (basically, chain a bunch of exec() calls while changing some stuff in the current process. trivial to use for setuid, chroot, cgroup-isolation, and so on, while keeping the code pretty easy to audit)

[16:43:21] <jim> earendel, uarts are serial ports with a bit of intelligence

[16:44:32] <peace-angel> how do i get a riseup.net email account?
[16:44:40] <katp32> retaken: even if they're using 5.6 or newer, their distro might build it as a kernel module and package it seperately
[16:44:43] <rahl> arahael: I refused to get a mobile till around 2005

[16:48:15] <peace-angel> no it's not google dns lol
[16:48:18] <linsux> there is nothing wrong with systemd, why so many people hate it
[16:48:29] <peace-angel> what i found searching is it was a wifi jail feature
[16:48:33] <peace-angel> checking some thing
[16:48:53] <peace-angel> it was dumb. but i found no way to stop mint from contacting 'google' ip's every 5 minutes

[16:50:53] <arahael> linsux: systemd and docker didn't always work well together (do they work well together yet?), and there's some other complications with it.  That said, I feel systemd is still the ideal solution for laptop and desktop users.

[16:53:58] <tahc> jim, trusting anything is a dumb decision. Everything is a privacy violation these days.
[16:54:00] <rahl> jim: not sure I trust redhat ;) but aside from that, I was simply pointing out that the fact it "works" is not really the problem a lot of people have with it

[16:54:28] <peace-angel> but it was very annoying.

[16:54:40] <katp32> yes, many devices do that
[16:54:43] <peace-angel> that wa the name for it
[16:54:52] <TJ-> took me a bit but, DEBIAN are the project that added the Google nameserver default to the systemd package: "By default, systemd-resolved uses Cloudflare and Google Public DNS servers"
[16:54:56] <katp32> firefox also does that, regardless of your networking management software
[16:54:57] <jim> I use kde, but I'm looking to switch, the window manager (umm kwin?) has a bug involving the bottom bar, and making a window fullscreen
[16:55:12] <linsux> redhat biggest problem for me is 3rd party repo
[16:55:15] <Yonle> Well, I can finally leave plasma. lol
[16:55:25] <tahc> Hell, your processor for the last 20 years post 9/11 has been a privacy violation.

[16:55:35] <linsux> firewall and selinux can be learn, but repo cannot control
[16:55:40] <peace-angel> so i swore off mint and ubuntu forever because of captive portals

[16:55:57] <linsux> plasma is nice, but too sweet for me
[16:55:58] <katp32> peace-angel: yeah, it should probably provide some kind of config option to set the URL for captive portal checking, it's extremely simple to do

[20:03:19] <naptastic> TJ-, Three drives remain. It was actually running in degraded mode earlier, but then I had to power off the host to move it, and the array didn't reassemble on boot.
[20:03:43] <TJ-> naptastic: is it mirror + stripe (1 + 0) ?
[20:03:54] <blackgatonegro> Can you ar least restore from backup?
[20:04:24] <naptastic> TJ-, it's using md-raid's 10 personality, so that part is opaque to me.
[20:04:34] <TJ-> naptastic: depending on the distro, mdadm in the initialramfs may be configured NOT to assemble a degraded array without an additional command-line option
