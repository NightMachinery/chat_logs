[05:19:20] <rawtaz> sure
[05:20:07] <rawtaz> so, you can always clean up the apt stuff a bit by running  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  when youre done with apt. can you add that and see how much it lowers the size? im just curious before you go further :)
[05:20:25] <pycurious> k - sure
[05:21:55] <DoofusCanadensis> you're leaving the nginx source and make files around after nginx is installed
[05:22:33] <DoofusCanadensis> along with all the tools you used to build nginx
[05:23:03] <DoofusCanadensis> any particular reason you're building the app instead of using an official image?
[05:24:43] <pycurious> DoofusCanadensis: The official image has "-g" and user=x and group=y + I've to compile modules on it which is painful. The ./configure is what I'm trying to control.
[05:25:03] <DoofusCanadensis> that's fair
[05:25:18] <pycurious> DoofusCanadensis: I was looking for an example of how to copy over the compiled nginx to a smaller image. Never done that
[05:26:06] <rawtaz> pycurious: once you made curious me happy by telling me how much that made a difference, look at how this multi-stage Dockerfile is building the software using one image, lines 1-10, and then finally producing the actual final image out of this Dockerfile by using another image and just copying the result/artifact from the first step in lines 12-18: https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile
[05:26:51] <rawtaz> if you do the same i think you should get a small image. you could basically use the official image in the second step and just replace the nginx binary you compiled yourself from the first step into it by that COPY --from thing.
[05:27:22] <pycurious> oh ! you make it sound very easy! 
[05:27:36] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, that
[05:27:45] <pycurious> rawtaz: I'm using a different compiler for example - would that be an issue. Not sure if everything is statically linked + the libraries+versions?
[05:27:49] <rawtaz> yeah. besides any change in the size of the nginx binary, this should give you teh same size as the original

[05:28:20] <pycurious> for example in my image the openssl version will be different than what is in the official ?

[05:29:15] <pycurious> rawtaz:  RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  —> I added this at the last line - no change in size
[05:29:22] <rawtaz> you can simply check that if you want by exec'ing into the containers and check versions etc
[05:29:34] <rawtaz> oh ok, thanks for checking
[05:29:51] <pycurious> rawtaz: so you are saying derive from official image, recompile things in that image? I'm currently using ubuntu 20 to compile - a difference. 
[05:30:24] <rawtaz> yeah why not
[05:30:40] <rawtaz> if you dont have a reason to use another image than they use to compile it
[05:30:44] <rawtaz> why do so
[05:31:20] <rawtaz> i mean either you go the track of trying to keep things the same as in the original, just changing the options when compiling. or you go the track of while youre at it building with more updated stuff

[08:04:38] <queue[m]> ill hook you up with a docker-compose file, few more mins
[08:05:00] <blendguy> Switched to adguard home and now I wanna switch back to pi-hole
[08:06:11] <blendguy> Want to run it in a container as it's more flexible and also 2 networks because I want to hook the internal with home assistant integration
[08:07:11] <queue[m]> https://pastebin.com/yWwpsK6t
[08:08:00] <queue[m]> you can change the 10.8.0.1 stuff, i only use that because im re-directing traffic into a vpn
[08:08:12] <queue[m]> so when i connect to vpn im blocking ads by default
[08:08:28] <blendguy> Thanks I will try it now
[08:09:09] <queue[m]> you just make this a docker-compose.yml file and docker-compose up -d
[08:09:10] <blendguy> Also is there a way to set it up with a command cli
[08:09:29] <blendguy> New to docker and I find compose a bit confusing
[08:09:39] <queue[m]> its easier, trust me
[08:09:43] <queue[m]> you're working backwards without it
[08:10:00] <queue[m]> if you docker run, it's not near as organized and you'll get used to the wrong thing
[08:10:36] <blendguy> I see, I usually have a text file with the docker run commands saved ,lol
[08:10:49] <queue[m]> see that's caveman'ing it
[08:11:00] <queue[m]> when you can just put it into docker-compose.yml and docker-compose up -d and its done
[08:11:40] <blendguy> I see
[08:12:07] <blendguy> also how would one go about updating their container to the latest versions
[08:12:15] <blendguy> Like for example portainer
[08:12:49] <queue[m]> portainer is just bloat
[08:12:50] <queue[m]> not needed
[08:13:20] <queue[m]> and docker image rm <img_id>
[08:13:29] <queue[m]> then reload the container
[08:13:46] <queue[m]> and you're using --net where you want --network
[08:14:00] <queue[m]> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/
[08:14:16] <blendguy> Just for an example, I also have my own image for home assist ant and I want to update it with the latest version, should I ssh into and apt update? ??
[08:14:42] <queue[m]> no
[08:14:46] <queue[m]> kill the container
[08:14:51] <queue[m]> rm the image, then run it again
[08:14:54] <queue[m]> it will download the latest image
[08:15:21] <blendguy> --net worked previously with only one network
[08:15:21] <queue[m]> if you update it inside the container, it will just go back to its normal state when you restart it
[08:15:56] <blendguy> Ahh  I see
[08:16:20] <queue[m]> yea idk man i dont do docker run much, i can just tell ya id use docker-compose as it's lined out and just add dockernet: external: true

[08:21:33] <blendguy> Ohh I have previously configured macvlan to to continued from 192.168.1.65 from portainer ui
[08:21:57] <queue[m]> then no need to set the ip if its already done
[08:22:04] <queue[m]> if its already running you dont need to set that again
[08:22:17] <queue[m]> you just do external: true and ignore the bridge and all the ipam and ipv4_address stuff i added
[08:22:30] <queue[m]> you can also do
[08:22:42] <queue[m]> --network_mode=dockernet:service
[08:22:47] <blendguy> If it randomly picsk the ip and when I restart it just jumps to one higher number
[08:23:15] <queue[m]> yea it goes from 172.18 to 172.19 is that what you mean?
[08:23:23] <blendguy> Yeah exactly

[08:24:27] <queue[m]> and you want dockernet to access it too?
[08:24:54] <blendguy> Yes so home assistant can communicate with pi-hole
[08:25:13] <blendguy> Both are docker container within dockernet network
[08:25:21] <queue[m]> ok cool

[08:25:36] <blendguy> Mymacvlan network so that I can
[08:25:56] <blendguy> Add 192.168.1.65 as DNS in my home router
[08:26:27] <queue[m]> i see
[08:26:35] <queue[m]> so honestly you can name 'macvlan' whatever you want in the config
[08:26:36] <queue[m]> https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/igozaheruw.yaml
[08:26:45] <blendguy> I am using dockernet as I want home assist to log and communicate when the router is down
[08:27:02] <queue[m]> it looks like i already have it setup properly, since dockernet knows its ip and the only one you're adding here is 'macvlan:' but you can change the name to whatever you want
[08:27:13] <queue[m]> set the ipv4_address and subnet to your liking and its done
[08:28:11] <queue[m]> if you plan on assigning 192.168.1.68 later
[08:28:16] <blendguy> Yeah gimme a sec to test it out

[09:11:17] <queue[m]> its simple thats just the http
[09:11:24] <queue[m]> thats for the web UI
[09:11:32] <blendguy> Also why is there a conflict
[09:11:41] <queue[m]> because you have port 80 in use

[09:11:59] <blendguy> The network we added is different from the host its running on
[09:12:08] <queue[m]> doesnt matter
[09:12:31] <queue[m]> if its live open on localhost its the same with docker
[09:12:37] <queue[m]> docker has its own internal port mapping
[09:12:42] <blendguy> In the host I have adguard running on 192.168.1.14

[09:14:19] <queue[m]> if its already in use
[09:14:29] <queue[m]> you have to select a new port for your web UI
[09:14:41] <queue[m]> its real simple just use 8080:8080 like im saying or shut adguard down then load pihole up again
[09:14:53] <queue[m]> no it doesnt work like that blendguy
[09:15:02] <blendguy> Oh maybe if I just remove all port maps it would work as I don't need it to be mapped to my host ip
[09:15:05] <queue[m]> you can network containers together
[09:15:09] <queue[m]> you can define ip addresses
[09:15:11] <queue[m]> but port mapping is port mapping
[09:15:40] <queue[m]> it doesnt matter if its a different 'network' its still being published on the same PC
[09:15:44] <queue[m]> with the same port, period
[09:15:47] <blendguy> On 8080 I've got shinobi NVR container running
[09:15:55] <queue[m]> bro u know how we fix this?

[09:22:39] <queue[m]> yea i see that, thats easy to see what you need to change there
[09:22:45] <queue[m]> just rm -rf the apache blocks
[09:22:54] <queue[m]> and choose if you want nginx or nginx-alpine
[09:23:00] <pycurious> https://github.com/coreruleset/modsecurity-crs-docker - I was to just build a particular platform and nginx/Dockerfile
[09:23:01] <queue[m]> also delete apache noise from 'groups'
[09:23:33] <queue[m]> personally i wouldnt use modsecurity
[09:23:37] <pycurious> Perhaps there is a way to do that using -> docker buildx use $…

[09:27:20] <queue[m]> .dockerignore
[09:27:26] <queue[m]> add .env to it
[09:27:29] <queue[m]> its just like .gitignore

[09:27:50] <queue[m]> shouldnt be uploading that

[09:27:56] <queue[m]> lol
[09:28:31] <queue[m]> plus in flask
[09:28:39] <queue[m]> if you don't declare a route to it, it doesnt exist
[09:28:42] <pycurious> queue-: is there a way to list all endpoints in flask that are not protected using a password/auth?
[09:28:51] <queue[m]> thats flask's templating system, its not as strict as django but its better imo
[09:29:02] <queue[m]> yes
[09:29:08] <queue[m]> thats precisely what im using it for
[09:29:14] <queue[m]> user login management
[09:29:34] <pycurious> how do you list all endpoints that are not protected for a flask app?
[09:29:49] <blendguy> queue[m]: I used the same macvlan network that I used to setup openwrt in a docker
[09:29:53] <queue[m]> you just don't include the @login_required flag
[09:29:59] <queue[m]> before defining the function
[09:30:13] <queue[m]> like i said you add the route, and then theres access
[09:30:14] <pycurious> queue-: and if you forgot? 
[09:30:22] <queue[m]> why would you forget
[09:30:37] <queue[m]> you want functioning code right?
[09:30:38] <pycurious> lol
[09:30:49] <queue[m]> do you not test your site after its up
[09:31:02] <queue[m]> what are you talking about forgetting here? we can forget a lot of things
[09:31:08] <queue[m]> hell im forgetting this conversation rn as we speak
[09:31:24] <blendguy> ...
[09:31:58] <queue[m]> if you forgot to add @login_required
[09:32:06] <queue[m]> people have access to the site, its wide open without user login
[09:32:07] <queue[m]> thats all
[09:32:52] <blendguy> To update pi-hole version do ssh into the container and run pihole
[09:33:03] <blendguy> Run pi-hole -up"
[09:33:03] <queue[m]> no
[09:33:05] <blendguy> *
[09:33:07] <pycurious> if you have a 1000 endpoints, how do you scan which are the ones not-protected - is what i was asking.
[09:33:13] <queue[m]> no you just rm the image
[09:33:27] <queue[m]> docker-compose down ; docker image rm pihole ; docker-compose up -d
[09:33:54] <queue[m]> im not sure you can even update in the shell itself
[09:34:03] <queue[m]> you can try docker exec -it pihole -up
[09:34:08] <queue[m]> i dont think it will let u
[09:34:25] <blendguy> I just got the installed with the latest tag but from the web ui it says update available run pihole -up
[09:34:27] <queue[m]> like i said tho once the container restarts ur only getting teh latest version that pihole sends out
[09:34:47] <queue[m]> yes because it doesnt have the most updated packaged version in docker
[09:35:09] <queue[m]> and honestly you dont need to update it that often
[09:35:09] <blendguy> Ahh I see I use portainer just too much

[10:13:18] <queue[m]> on matrix.org at least...
[10:13:39] <blendguy> I like XMPP though
[10:13:44] <queue[m]> if you get too advanced you lose the crowd and they go back to blogging about privacy and browsers
[10:13:52] <queue[m]> lol
[10:14:01] <queue[m]> xmpp is rekt, has been for a while
[10:14:15] <queue[m]> there have been so many ejabberd exploits ive seen over the years
[10:14:19] <queue[m]> you'd be surprised as hell 
[10:14:48] <queue[m]> plus the OTR is bs and broken
[10:15:08] <queue[m]> telegram is hacked even worse than xmpp
[10:15:21] <blendguy> Well all the info I got about all these apps were from matrix groups, after a month it got repetitive ,same apps again and 
[10:15:34] <queue[m]> yep
[10:15:45] <queue[m]> the apps are usually browsers or browser extensions
[10:15:47] <queue[m]> lol
[10:15:53] <blendguy> Are they
[10:16:01] <queue[m]> thats all these kids talk about man
[10:16:08] <blendguy> Well that's where I found about f droid
[10:16:26] <queue[m]> no matter what matrix.org chan i join, even in the python chan they talk more about browsers than actual code
[10:16:35] <blendguy> Well matrix was just a means for me to gather all the info

[10:24:25] <queue[m]> i ended up saying F it and didnt do dns on AWS, but its just like cloudflare here
[10:24:28] <blendguy> Would be cool if I could export and import the dhcp static ip list from router to pinole
[10:24:49] <queue[m]> u can turn dhcp off router
[10:24:53] <queue[m]> and turn it on pihole if u want

[10:25:33] <queue[m]> ah i see
[10:26:11] <queue[m]> i static everything so

[10:27:16] <blendguy> You do that in router or from pihole
[10:28:15] <blendguy> ...?
[10:28:19] <queue[m]> i honestly let my modem from my ISP do that

[11:04:45] <queue[m]> i personally dont have a use out of it
[11:04:56] <queue[m]> theres not one of its kind, you're using it already
[11:05:08] <queue[m]> i just dont have use for nextcloud, couldnt imagine anyone elses

[11:07:03] <queue[m]> dont use wordpress
[11:07:10] <queue[m]> yes please dont use wordpress
[11:07:14] <queue[m]> just learn html and bootstrap
[11:07:18] <queue[m]> and CSS
[11:07:21] <queue[m]> and javascript
[11:07:21] <blendguy> So I looked up online and found hugo
[11:07:36] <queue[m]> bootstrap is a framework within html that sets a lot of classes for you
[11:07:39] <blendguy> And I couldn't get it working
[11:07:44] <queue[m]> u just have to call on them and know what they do and set the colors u want
[11:07:54] <queue[m]> then throw up your own code or build from a template
[11:08:31] <blendguy> I want something where I can add posts about my docker projects so I could refer to them in future
[11:08:34] <queue[m]> use nginx httpd and dump your site stuff in /var/www/html
[11:08:38] <blendguy> What do you suggest
[11:09:01] <queue[m]> eh id probably just use some golang blogposter 
[11:09:03] <queue[m]> hugo probably
[11:09:07] <queue[m]> for something like that
[11:09:12] <queue[m]> my buddy does that same thing
