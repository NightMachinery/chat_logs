[01:10:56] <Tor[m]> As we discussed lol NIT's and are you sure you don't want in finance or some other job in that field ? 
[01:16:55] <Tor[m]> Plus cost man and how much time you want to spend
[01:17:51] <Tor[m]> Like MCA is like  3 years and cost goes over 2 lacs in good college
[04:35:47] <Zbnssn[m]> <AryaK[m]> "bitwarden is the best foss one" <- Vaultwarde is better is a better reimplementation of bitwarden in rust and also has the premium features in bitwarden available for free
[04:37:43] <Zbnssn[m]> https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki
[04:37:43] <Zbnssn[m]> Bitwarden - 9.3k stars
[04:37:43] <Zbnssn[m]> Vaultwarden - 14.5k stars
[04:40:14] <Zbnssn[m]> it was the first app I ran in a docker container... before this I tried stuff with docker but couldnt understand much

[09:40:06] <gtlsgamr[m]> I suggest not doing it. 
[10:18:51] <relejek[m]> Neo Void: i suggest do certification courses instead from well known online course providers. unacadmy's certificates have weight in product based tech companies and startups.
[10:36:58] <AryaK[m]> what about comptia and stuff?
[11:09:48] <NeoVoid[m]> IGNOU provide mca in cheap but they also says their course might not be well updated
[11:10:01] <NeoVoid[m]> <AryaK[m]> "what about comptia and stuff?" <- too expensive
[12:08:24] <Tor[m]> Like i said if you really want to do it do it from NIT's
[12:10:51] <relejek[m]> NITs. i mean if you have to spend money and years for sake of a paper that proclaims that you were in an NIT for a certain period of time.
[12:10:51] <relejek[m]> go for it.

[12:21:03] <NeoVoid[m]> but I also worried about age concern.
[12:21:03] <NeoVoid[m]> so in this age either i should have job or college or course.
[12:22:42] <NeoVoid[m]> may be i should give myself more time to think before taking any stupid decision that will make me regret later.

[12:34:09] <Tor[m]> Tbh job prospects are good in NIT's that's the only reason i suggested him 
[12:34:38] <Tor[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "may be i should give myself more..." <- you need more time to think too
[12:38:07] <relejek[m]> Tor[m]: bruh they want a NIT fresher over a Masters, less to pay and easy to train. so, yes more companies go for NITians but for fresh blood.
[12:41:28] <Tor[m]> @[Neo Void]  fo you just have bcom or have some more in your resume ?
