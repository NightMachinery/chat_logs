[01:12:55] <d33cee> hi all, hoping for a sanity check on this. Using asp.net in .NET 6. I'm trying to do a redirect from code which is called BY a controller but is not IN a controller - so I have the HttpContext but I can't use IActionResult.

[01:13:34] <d33cee> When I call context.Response.Redirect, _even if I set the boolean to true_, it just continues executing code.
[01:14:50] <BSaboia> WPF is still bound to Windows only, right?
[01:15:05] <d33cee> does ThreadAbortException no longer exist? does CompleteRequest no longer exist? I don't care what I use; I just want this code to _actually redirect_. What am I missing? Thanks.
[01:15:16] <irwiss> calling most functions on httpcontext doesn't mean it stops the code flow
[01:15:47] <irwiss> i'd just return a flag to redirect, rather than pull httpcontext outside the controller, then you can have controller do the redirect as normal and avoid taking dependency on http stuff inside your "non-controller" code
[01:16:25] <d33cee> thanks but I'm not wanting to restructure anything right now; just wondering if it is possible at all
[01:16:45] <d33cee> irwiss: are you implying that both ThreadAbortException and CompleteRequest no longer exist?
[01:16:55] <chilversc> d33cee: I would restructure the code so that the function does not perform a redirect, and instead has a way to signal to the caller that a redirect is required (e.g. by its return value)
[01:17:15] <d33cee> chilversc: same question. Are you telling me the best practice or are you telling me that it is literally impossible?
[01:17:26] <irwiss> d33cee: actually it seems if you're calling the overload it should kill off the thread, weird
[01:17:38] <chilversc> it leads to less confusing code, I'm not sure if its impossible in the latest .net version
[01:18:02] <irwiss> otoh i still wouldn't use the abort for control flow
[01:18:52] <d33cee> this is for prototyping; it'll be cleaned up later if it works
[01:19:15] <chilversc> d33cee: though the source code is available so you could just quickly check that function to see what it does in your specific version
[01:19:27] <chilversc> is that aspnetcore 6.0.2?
[01:19:58] <d33cee> chilversc: true, but ThreadAbortException is a weird thing, right? I thought it would be hard to actually see if it gets re-thrown.
[01:20:38] <d33cee> Forget all that and let me approach this question from another direction...
[01:21:22] <d33cee> Surely Response.Redirect is meant to still work in .NET 6, even if we ignore the existence of controllers.
[01:21:43] *** Joins: jamea22 (~jamea@189.237.20.19)
[01:21:47] <chilversc> d33cee: thread abort is only wierd in that if you catch it, but do not supress it then it will be re-thrown at the end of the catch block
[01:22:08] <chilversc> d33cee: I would expect that to be the case as its generally backwards compatible
[01:22:15] <d33cee> chilversc: right - it's weird in that the runtime (or the compiled code, or something) handles it specially
[01:22:32] *** Quits: jamea (~jamea@189.237.20.19) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:22:58] <chilversc> d33cee: yeah, the thread abort exception effectively sets a signal on the thread, and unless that signal is unset it will keep raising it at the end of any catch block
[01:23:22] <d33cee> so, if Response.Redirect doesn't immediately redirect me, I naturally ask whether there's any way to 'finish' the response, like you could in framework.
[01:23:36] <Nasp> d33cee:  Why dont you just use the controllerRedirect
[01:23:43] <Nasp> you in general sohuldn't use the response and context object
[01:24:12] <d33cee> like I said, prototyping. If it works, THEN we'll consider restructuring things to make it work the right way.
[01:24:20] <Nasp> Yes that is to use return redirect
[01:24:45] <Nasp> If you dont know how the use the response objects then you shouldn't touch them
[01:25:37] <chilversc> d33cee: you don't have any code that is catching the thread abort exception then calling Thread.ResetAbort() ?

[01:26:39] <chilversc> d33cee: also, how do you access the current HttpContext, as some of the modern APIs gives you a wrapper, could it be you're using an alternative implementation that has changed the redirect behaviour?
[01:26:56] <d33cee> chilversc: passing it from the controller
[01:27:14] <chilversc> d33cee: do you have a debugger, if so check the actual concrete type you're using
[01:27:22] <Nasp> Maybe a sample code?
[01:27:27] <d33cee> Nasp: Maybe that's good advice but I'm asking a very specific question about finishing the response
[01:27:43] <Nasp> d33cee:  You finish the response by returning
[01:27:48] <d33cee> If there is no equivalent to CompleteRequest() then please say so
[01:28:20] <chilversc> d33cee: well Redirect with true, is supposed to call Response.End() then throw an exception to abort the current handler
[01:28:51] <chilversc> d33cee: hence why I want to check what the actual implementation of HttpContext is, as then we can check that its the expected implementation
[01:29:01] <d33cee> right...I need to triple-check to make sure the boolean is still true in the deployed code
[01:29:23] <Nasp> Doesn't the true just mean it's a permanent redirect?
[01:30:16] <d33cee> chilversc: it's a Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.DefaultHttpContext
[01:30:25] <chilversc> maybe, it's been a while since I've used that function, it might be that you need to call redirect, then Response.End(true)

[01:32:41] <chilversc> yeah, Response.Redirect only sets the target https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c85baf8db0c72ae8e68643029d514b2e737c9fae/src/Http/Http/src/Internal/DefaultHttpResponse.cs#L142

[01:34:19] <Nasp> Else you should use LocalRedirect, it's safer
[01:35:03] <chilversc> d33cee: I would be tempted since its only a PoC to throw a custom exception type, and just add an exception handler to perform the redirect
[01:35:16] <Nasp> d33cee:  Wasn't this already in a controller?
[01:35:17] <chilversc> d33cee: so long as you do not have any generic catch any exception and ignore that would work

[01:58:30] <d33cee> Nasp: Basically, the controller is like you see, and it's much harder for me to change the controller right now. That's why I was looking for the missing line.
[01:58:48] <d33cee> It's not really a migration.
[01:59:10] <Nasp> But didnt yo utalk about old mvc?
[01:59:10] <chilversc> though there used to be a different redirect method https://docs.microsoft.com/en-GB/troubleshoot/developer/webapps/aspnet/development/threadabortexception-occurs-you-use-response-end

[01:59:41] <Nasp> Most of those methods dissapeared for a reason
[02:00:16] <chilversc> yeah, it just supprised me that they then added a method back to HttpResponse with the same signature as the old method
[02:00:17] *** Quits: jamea (~jamea@189.237.20.19) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:00:44] <d33cee> there was a migration previously...I guess this design (my 'IOtherCodeHandler') should have changed at that point.
[02:01:59] <chilversc> probaly, I can see it exists in the old .Net 4.8 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httpresponse.redirect?view=netframework-4.8#system-web-httpresponse-redirect(system-string-system-boolean)
[02:03:31] <Nasp>  chilversc  Well that method works
[02:03:36] <Nasp> But it doesn't shortcircuit like that old one
[02:03:46] <Nasp> It sets the result to a redirect, but the response doens't gets written imediatly
[02:03:52] <Nasp> That was kinda the issues with the old mvc
[02:04:17] <chilversc> Nasp: yup, but is a bit of a supprise if you've simply moved some code over, as the old code would compile against the new request type but the behaviour is very different
[02:04:54] <Nasp> So it's been moved and now it doesn't work?
[02:05:02] <Nasp> Well if the signature is the same then it compiles
[02:07:29] <d33cee> hm, that is unfortunate
[02:07:48] <chilversc> d33cee: any reason you can't just hack the controller a little to handle a custom exception type, then throw that exception type? It would give you the minimum amount of change to test this out
[02:07:48] <d33cee> no choice but to change the controller first, then
[02:08:11] <chilversc> d33cee: though with the plugin model, you should be able to just plug in a custom exception handler for that exception type without changing the controller either
[02:08:23] <d33cee> TBH that seems more complicated
[02:08:29] <Nasp> If he's already in a controller it's not nice to throw an exception
[02:08:38] <Nasp> We have way too much of what where i work
[02:08:44] <Nasp> So throw REdirectException("url") ?
[02:08:48] <Nasp> Seems a bit dirty
[02:08:55] <Nasp> Also looks like easy fix
[02:09:26] <d33cee> no, I'm just going to change the controller, but this way I have to get through the red tape first
[02:09:32] <d33cee> no big problem
[02:09:39] <Nasp> red tape?
[02:09:43] <Nasp> Change it and be done
[02:10:22] <d33cee> not red tape so much as "hey i am changing this, be aware"

[11:39:00] <MatthiasVance> Luckily there are only a few, will make sure to properly close up everything when they re-do the roof
[11:39:12] <jmer> flies?
[11:39:20] <MatthiasVance> Cluster flies in the attic
[11:39:33] <MatthiasVance> They go there for the winter and fly out when it gets warmer (now)
[11:39:36] <jmer> Ah.
[11:39:41] <jmer> Seems weird
[11:39:46] <jmer> have you gotten a second oppinion?
[11:39:56] <MatthiasVance> Well to exterminate you'd have to find the source
[11:40:08] <MatthiasVance> Which means breaking things down
[11:43:45] <jmer> I read about ants... since the ones invading here are living under the floor we can either break up the floor and remove it manually or get a professional out to spread ant poison all around the house
[11:43:59] <jmer> it's about 330â‚¬ pr. year but then he will come as many time as is needed
[11:44:01] <jmer> in that year
[11:44:15] <jmer> but he did say that if it's a big colony it can take several years.
[11:47:05] <Nasp> When you bank account suddently show more money than you know you got i somehow dont feel so confident in my bank
[11:49:11] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Oh wow yeah, then it's different. Also I'm pretty sure they could poison in the attic but since the pheromones will still be there you could start over very soon
[11:49:25] <MatthiasVance> jmer: What kind of ants do you have ?
[11:49:34] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Take it all out

[11:55:52] <jmer> MatthiasVance: it's not poison to humans
[11:56:02] <MatthiasVance> Oh!
[11:56:03] <jmer> they are putting out a "belt" of poison around the walls inside and outside
[11:56:13] <jmer> so the ants can't really get outside of their nest without passing through the poison
[11:56:23] <jmer> and its' long term stuff so the point is they drag it bag to the nest
[11:56:32] <jmer> So when new ants hatch they run into it straight away...
[11:56:43] <jmer> So, sooner or later, you end up killing off the nest
[11:57:07] <jmer> and it's the most common ant we have here in DEnmark (we have 3 different species where the worst one is limited to northern parts of the country)
[11:57:19] <jmer> also the most common one is the one that very, very rarely damages the house.
[11:57:22] <jmer> so I think I am lucky
[11:57:26] <jmer> but they are still annoying
[11:58:23] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Yeah just like the flies, harmless by themselves but so annoying to have 2-5 flying around. I have seen them less the past 2 weeks :o

[14:03:28] <Flonk> edcba, azure batch job schedules don't support timezones and it's a mess. Have to implement the feature myself and I hate working with dates and times
[14:03:52] <Flonk> bomb, my condolences :p
[14:04:33] <edcba> ok maybe the test has not the best naming
[14:05:19] <edcba> you just want to test that difference between 2 jobs is same even when DST
[14:06:02] <jmer> lol oh yeah
[14:06:11] <jmer> we were told last week that for two days this week JIRA will be unavailable
[14:06:14] <jmer> because of an upgrade...
[14:06:34] <edcba> that thing is always upgrading
[14:07:05] <jmer> I'm more flabbergasted that someone can just... Shut down JIRA for two days
[14:07:17] <jmer> and not even ask the dev teams using it if it fits
[14:07:27] <jmer> ... this should've been done in the weekend or outside normal work hours in a service window
[14:07:33] <Flonk> edcba, what we did is to have two job schedules, one hours apart, both running the same job, and one the jobs just does nothing and shuts down depending on whether it's DST or not.
[14:07:44] <Flonk> I can't english sorry
[14:07:51] <edcba> especially when jira have previously been imposed to those devs :)
[14:07:57] <jmer> englishing hard, yes?
[14:08:01] <Flonk> quite
[14:08:21] <jmer> edcba: I don't think it's that bad if used correctly

[14:09:12] <jmer> bomb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuMX8Kf3Wyw
[14:09:21] <edcba> well the fact it is centralized is bad
[14:09:57] <jmer> edcba: what do you mean by centralized?
[14:10:05] <jmer> That each team doesn't have their own private "instance" ?
[14:10:19] <bomb> jmer lol
[14:10:44] <edcba> well devs should just use what they want and higher ups should define what data they want from devs to track/etc
[14:11:19] <jmer> edcba: I don't think the higher ups looks at JIRA... They might look at statistics created by scrummasters based off of the data in JIRA...
[14:11:22] <Nasp> jmer:  Well not always those upgrading it are paid for upgrading it in the weekends
[14:11:30] <edcba> well you could define the interface being jira but that's a bit dumb

[14:11:40] <Nasp> Just do like us, and use a really old version of jira
[14:11:48] <Nasp> Then the CVE's dont affect it either :D
[14:12:08] <jmer> And there's at least 5 dev teams hit by this
[14:12:13] <Nasp> edcba: Isn't it alkso bad if each time use a different tool
[14:12:17] <Nasp> Wouldn't that make it even worse
[14:12:24] <Nasp> jmer:  Same here
[14:12:43] <edcba> i said the higher ups define the data they want, so they would use the same for every one and they have to adapt
[14:12:52] <eurogos> ...so I've got to migrate a database from v1 to v2 of an app where the userId changes from an int to a uuid
[14:12:58] <jmer> Nasp: my point is, it doesn't make sense to shut down a critical system for two days and not even give us 1 month to plan for it
[14:13:04] <Nasp> edcba:  So each time need to make a tool that reports all tickets to another tool?
[14:13:13] <Nasp> jmer:  Yeah but could be necessary
[14:13:17] <Nasp> If there's a vulnerability
[14:13:33] <Nasp> We've had people force reboot peoples laptops while working on them due to a security issue in chrome
[14:13:36] <Nasp> Man some people were pissed
[14:13:41] <jmer> Nasp: If  that's the case I would expect they could wait to more days or have done it last weekend or last week
[14:13:43] <Nasp> Someone was running a training job or something
[14:13:46] <Nasp> And the next day, all gone
[14:13:56] <jmer> two more*
[14:14:02] <eurogos> am i right in thinking that I can remove all constraints, then reapply them with cascade so that when I update the userId, sqlserver will update all the references too?
[14:14:17] <Nasp> Ahh im so tired of this VS asking "Do you want to reload, there's changes?"
[14:14:19] <jmer> eurogos: you can temporarily disable constraints
[14:14:20] <Nasp> Yes, do i have any other choice
[14:14:41] <eurogos> its just that the userId is also used as updatedById on all tables
[14:14:52] <eurogos> so it gets complicated
[14:15:03] <edcba> but yeah i don't think jira is the worse tool but i think a lot of ppl would be more efficient using more lightweight tools
[14:15:10] <jmer> I don't think you can get SQL Server to replace data like that with a cascading FK constraint
[14:15:22] <Nasp> edcba:  Jira is horrible
[14:15:50] <eurogos> really? I was hoping ON UPDATE CASCADE would just do that for me
[14:15:54] <edcba> also they have a new? thingy "jira work management" so it is jira for business
[14:16:18] <edcba> not sure why they needed something different for "business" ppl
[14:16:27] <jmer> eurogos: you basically n eed to replace those IDs with a new datatype and the new values that fit with that datatype
[14:16:46] <Nasp> Jira's just like really really slow
[14:16:59] <Nasp> I tried hosting it myself once and it was slow, and i thought i probably screwed up some settings
[14:17:03] <Nasp> Then i tried their hosted option
[14:17:06] <Nasp> Nope it's just horrible

[14:17:27] <jmer> Nasp: I don't know how your JIRA is setup but I've never seen jira be that slow any of the places I've used it.
[14:17:42] <Nasp> Our jira has 10k projects
[14:17:47] <jmer> the JIRAs I've used have been just as slow/fast as other apps based on a web UI
[14:17:51] <Nasp> Navigating takes seconds
[14:17:59] <Nasp> So you have to slow yourself down
[14:18:05] <Nasp> I need downers to work with stuff that slow
[14:18:15] <jmer> lol
[14:18:26] <jmer> you live close to Christiania, that should be doable xD
[14:18:57] <edcba> yeah displaying an issue may take 1s here sometimes
[14:19:04] <Nasp> jmer:  Not that close
[14:19:12] <Nasp> Also they dont sell drugs
[14:19:32] <jmer> I'm fairly sure you can get some pretty hefty indica stuff there... It counts as downers ;)
[14:19:34] <edcba> it's bearable but yeah a tool like that it could be instantaneous if you do some bare html
[14:20:03] <jmer> eurogos: How are you managing the DB changes? do you use migrations (from EF or maybe Fluent Migrator) or do you have to do this by hand?
[14:20:42] <jmer> eurogos: you could also use SQL Server tooling (sqlpackage.exe and dacbacs/bacpacs) to apply the DB changes
[14:21:03] <Nasp> I just sneezed and our application broke
[14:21:20] <eurogos> thats how fragile ours is
[14:21:33] <eurogos> jmer, no migrations to do this particular migration
[14:22:33] <jmer> eurogos: I think I would add the new columns, set them up, make sure they work... write some mapping logic between the old and new columns, verify they work and then remove the old columns
[14:23:26] <eurogos> its keeping the references between userId PK and the referenced columns in other tables which is the tough bit
[14:23:49] <eurogos> i need to generate new UUID for each userId and have that new value refelected in all the references
[14:24:55] <jmer> eurogos: yes.
[14:25:03] <jmer> and you also need to map between the new and old ID's
[14:25:32] <jmer> This is why you want stable keys xD
[14:25:44] <Nasp> We have an AMA on reddit tomorrow
[14:25:51] <Nasp> No idea why the rest of us are told so late, hmm
[14:25:52] <eurogos> v1 is int and v2 is nvarchar - so I thought I could migrate the int value into the nvarchar value
[14:26:01] <eurogos> and then do some kind of update cascade
[14:26:11] <jmer> eurogos: if you have UUIDs (or GUIDs) please don't store them as Nvarchar
[14:26:14] <jmer> use the GUID type
[14:26:23] <jmer> or.. sorry it's called UniqueIdentifier
[14:26:34] <eurogos> ...chacking
[14:26:38] <eurogos> checking ^
[14:26:46] <Nasp> jmer:  Btw have you ever seen the show beliggende x 3?
[14:26:54] <Nasp> Or one of the other buying a house show
[14:27:01] <jmer> Nasp: Yes.
[14:27:04] <jmer> I've seen a couple
[14:27:07] <Nasp> What's wrong with those people
[14:27:17] <Nasp> We have 9.5 million and we acn't find a house to buy
[14:27:18] <eurogos> ef core created the field as nvarchar 450
[14:27:18] <jmer> Nasp: that's what I ask myself after almost every show of that type xD
[14:27:34] <Nasp> I saw some that bought a 80 year old house for 11 millions
[14:27:47] <jmer> eurogos: if you create it as a nvarchar you can't have it longer than... I think it's 50 chars else it won't fit in the index resulting in poor performance
[14:28:02] <jmer> I am unsure if its 50 or 45... but it's in that range...
[14:28:20] <jmer> and since it's a key there's a good chance you want it in your index
[14:29:11] <jmer> Nasp: Everyone I've spoken with who has made cash from investing in property has told me location is always the most important fact, because it's the only thing you can't change
[14:29:21] <Nasp> Am i the only one who has issues when stuff is slow
[14:29:27] <jmer> no I fucking hate it
[14:29:28] <Nasp> Like compile and wait around a minute to see the results
[14:29:33] <Nasp> And then i kinda forget wtf i was doing
[14:29:53] <jmer> Nasp: the task I've been working with the past couple months have a sleep for 5 min. in between each run
[14:30:00] <Nasp> Damn
[14:30:04] <jmer> each run = upload of each sitemap foile for each language
[14:30:05] <eurogos> its using asp identity... should I respecify the pk for user to be guid rather than string?
[14:30:10] <jmer> and there's 70 of those
[14:30:11] <Nasp> Also we are half way in this migration project
[14:30:17] <Nasp> And one of my collegues wants to enable multi compile

[14:30:27] <Nasp> So we are doubling the amount of project that needs to be compiled
[14:30:33] <Nasp> And i think that will make the last part take 10x as long
[14:30:35] <jmer> eurogos: I have only used the asp identity stuff once but from what I recall they use Guids for user keys allready?
[14:30:36] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  A bit
[14:30:40] <Nasp> But about what was expected
[14:30:46] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Why do they want to enable it for an API project? Makes 0 sense
[14:30:49] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Also i still haev open pull requests thatss from monday and friday
[14:30:56] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Becausde they want that .NET 5 now now now
[14:30:59] <Nasp> Even though it doesn't change a damn thing
[14:31:03] <Nasp> Except make dev cycle much slower
[14:31:05] <MatthiasVance> Are they dumb?
[14:31:10] <Nasp> Also one have been working on that since friday
[14:31:12] <eurogos> i thought so too but, its as a string in the model which results in nvarchar on the db
[14:31:15] <Nasp> Even though he wasn't tasked with it
[14:31:26] <Nasp> VS can barely handle the workload now
[14:31:31] <Nasp> If i need to compile 300 project
[14:31:38] <Nasp> Then i can compile, and then it may be done the next day
[14:31:43] <MatthiasVance> xD
[14:31:55] <MatthiasVance> Well, Nasp, if they do it smart it wouldn't mean double the compile time
[14:32:05] <Nasp> how can you avoid that
[14:32:05] <MatthiasVance> They could activate the .NET 5 targetting and you could stay on whatever you use now
[14:32:16] <Nasp> That would also mean double
[14:32:22] <MatthiasVance> No
[14:32:24] <Nasp> By activating .NET 5 we compile verything in framework and .NET 5
[14:32:29] <Nasp> So double
[14:32:34] <MatthiasVance> The Configuration Manager in VS can help with that
[14:32:38] <Nasp> How
[14:32:47] <eurogos> jmer, whats the objective in terms of db type for the pk field?
[14:32:49] <MatthiasVance> Make a new config ".NET 5" and change the csproj to use that
[14:32:55] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yes and?
[14:33:02] <jmer> eurogos: that it fits in an index
[14:33:05] <Nasp> We still need to compile it in framework
[14:33:06] <Nasp> So double
[14:33:12] <jmer> eurogos: you don't want a key that can't be indexed
[14:33:15] <Nasp> I'ts not a switch, is an addition
[14:33:19] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yes but *you* don't need .NET 5 so for *you* it's not double
[14:33:26] <Nasp> ?
[14:33:27] <MatthiasVance> Whoever wants to use .NET 5 can use that on their machine
[14:33:36] <Nasp> We have it that way now
[14:33:36] <eurogos> so I could specify nvarchar(50) as the PK
[14:33:37] <eurogos> ?
[14:33:43] <Nasp> But since we want to push it for prod we need to enable it locally as well
[14:33:50] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Why? Only on the build server
[14:33:52] <Nasp> And then yeah i dont think i'll be able to get any work done
[14:33:54] <Nasp> BEcause reasons
[14:34:10] <Nasp> I also tried to suggest only doing it on build server, CTO didn't like it
[14:34:19] * MatthiasVance rolls eyes :D
[14:34:20] <Nasp> Also it does mean there's a difference when developping locally
[14:34:23] <Nasp> So you can't test things properly
[14:34:31] <Suchiman> irwiss: yeah but 4k60 is still 8MP a frame vs. 2MP at 1080p60 and also 60 fps <3 there's still a decent improvement between those two :P
[14:34:32] <Nasp> I'd rather we first switch when we have 20% left
[14:34:32] <MatthiasVance> This is one clusterfuck :D
[14:34:35] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[14:34:36] <MatthiasVance> yeah
[14:34:44] <MatthiasVance> I'd opt for finishing the migration first
[14:34:46] <Nasp> First i was like maybe at 50%
[14:34:47] <MatthiasVance> And then upgrading
[14:34:52] <MatthiasVance> And if you want to go faster .. help with migrating!
[14:34:52] <Nasp> But now i'm like lets get as much done as possible
[14:35:03] <Nasp> Yeah but we only have 3 people working on this
[14:35:10] <MatthiasVance> That's what I mean
[14:35:15] <Nasp> And one decided to work on the .NET 5 switch because that was important to him
[14:35:21] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: We dont have any more people available
[14:35:30] <Nasp> We are at minimum number of devs
[14:35:43] <MatthiasVance> I then meant the one wanting .NET 5 :D
[14:35:49] <MaNa3k> one would assume visual studio will automatically add all the references neeed to the pkg when creating a servicebus function app, but noo, you have to manually add them
[14:35:53] <MatthiasVance> But they are from your migration team? That sucks even more!
[14:35:58] <MaNa3k> wtf is the whole poinf of templates
[14:36:05] <MatthiasVance> MaNa3k: ?
[14:36:13] <jmer> eurogos:  "900 bytes for a clustered index. 1,700 for a nonclustered index. Before SQL Server 2016, all versions supported 900 bytes for all index types." from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=sql-server-ver15
[14:36:29] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Also i dont think we can put more devs on this project
[14:36:33] <Nasp> Since you easily get so many conflicts
[14:36:45] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Yeah he's  borrowed to my team
[14:36:46] <MaNa3k> MatthiasVance, that is different libs and nuget pakages needed for a template to work without errors
[14:36:52] <MaNa3k> missing lib error*
[14:37:08] <Nasp>  MatthiasVance I can't figure out if it's jsut me, because often when i raise issues it like i'm the problem
[14:37:17] <Nasp> Same when i ask a collegue for help, then i say "Sure just call now"
[14:37:21] <Nasp> "Ohh sorry i'm just taking a smoke"
[14:38:15] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: From what you have described it seems the environment is not a good fit, so I wouldn't say you are the problem, you'd thrive in another environment
[14:38:22] <jmer> eurogos: sorry I might have fucked up slightly in terms of the key size xD sorry it's been quite a while since I had to work with this (several years)
[14:38:27] <MatthiasVance> Also why I think your manager (or whoever) should help with that
[14:38:37] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Help with?
[14:38:40] <Nasp> my manager is the CTO
[14:38:47] <MaNa3k> oh thats strange, visual studio decided to compile now without errors after i restarted it
[14:38:51] <bomb> maybe she's a woman, and is into you.
[14:38:56] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yes, help with creating an environment that works, or help you find another job xD
[14:39:01] <BSaboia> bomb, lol
[14:39:05] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Do you have 1:1s?
[14:39:11] <Nasp> yes
[14:39:27] <MatthiasVance> I think my question was really: Do they know how you feel about all this?
[14:39:55] <Nasp> I doubt it
[14:40:20] <BSaboia> Nasp, why don't you raise this directly to your colleagues?
[14:40:35] <Nasp> Because then i'm the problem
[14:40:49] <Suchiman> eurogos: a good primary key is small, unique, monotonously increasing and useful for lookups
[14:41:45] <eurogos> in this case it needs to be unique across multiple systems
[14:41:58] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: So you are in an environment you can't seem to change.. it's a losing game
[14:42:13] <MatthiasVance> Especially if you are unable to make other people (CTO) aware of that
[14:42:32] <eurogos> but its the userId PK so its kind of used everywhere
[14:42:36] <MatthiasVance> "you are unable" can also be when they brush it off
[14:42:57] <eurogos> Users are never sorted by userId but there are lots of lookups
[14:43:41] <BSaboia> Nasp, well, then you know that for sure. Then you can decide whether to endure this or go somewhere else
[14:44:25] <jmer> eurogos: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/uniqueidentifier-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15
[14:44:31] <bomb> aren't y'all Danish men working at LEGO factories?
[14:44:42] <jmer> Also in some edge cases I think unicode chars can be more than 2 bytes
[14:45:14] <jmer> ... maybe not so likely if it's just used to represent a GUID value... but still... Stringly types columns are a fucking pITA
[14:45:42] <jmer> eurogos: SQL server might actually sort stuff as part of a larger query so even though you're not sorting it, the DB might xD
[14:46:16] <BSaboia> There was a guy that I worked once that was in a very similar position that you are. He approached me 4 times for help and I wasn't able to. He then said that everyone else was doing the same to him, and asked me if I had anything against him. Others were apparently avoiding him (according to himself, I wasn't aware of it). I said no, he was unlucky because I was busy, we got to work a lot in the following week and he was fine afte
[14:46:16] <BSaboia> rwards So, Nasp, perhaps you would like to make sure that it is not your impression
[14:46:16] <jmer> just look at some of those execution plans and you will see it
[14:46:40] <eurogos> I wonder if i specify GUID as the c# type, maybe EF core will ask sqlserevr to create this uniqueidentifier type?

[14:48:54] <cloudbender> There's a glitch
[14:49:07] <cloudbender> Visual Studio Community Version 17.0.5
[14:49:16] <Suchiman> *scrolls up* eurogos: dropping the FK constraints, then the PK, then changing the PK field to varchar(36) and all FK fields as well, then creating the PK and FK constraints all again with ON UPDATE CASCADE, then update all PKs with CAST(NEWID() AS varchar(36)) and then if you want, drop all PK's and FK's again, change to uniqueidentifier and recreate all PKs and FKs sounds like a sound strategy
[14:49:38] <cloudbender> I've added two winforms custom controls, they are now in the toolbox and usable
[14:50:51] <cloudbender> However, there is also a custom control for 'pointer' in the toolbox section for the app namespace
[14:51:05] <cloudbender> I did not derive a custom pointer
[14:51:26] <eurogos> Suchiman, thanks... if I keep the PK in C# as string type but limit the column width in the sqlserver to varchar(36) do I minimize performance issues of stringy PK?
[14:52:01] <cloudbender> There also seems to be problems with enumeration of the toolbox items, and properties of designer components
[14:52:08] <jmer> Why not just use the compatible types that are designed to be GUIDs (UUID?)
[14:52:41] <Suchiman> eurogos: yeah varchar(36) is only 40 bytes in size, vs. nvarchar(50) which would be 104 bytes in size
[14:52:54] <jmer> Also the cascade approach will only work if every usage of this column as a FK/PK is actually set up as a constraint
[14:53:04] <eurogos> I also need this ef model to be compatible with sqlite
[14:53:23] <jmer> why?
[14:53:40] <eurogos> shared library with WPF application
[14:54:06] <Suchiman> eurogos: uhhhh, in that case, nevermind anything i said because Sqlite doesn't do migrations (TM) xD

[15:00:05] <Suchiman> eurogos: in the EF configuration, configure the field to be Unicode(false) or Ansi = true whatever the config is i can't remember
[15:00:26] <Suchiman> then you get varchar instead of nvarchar, and you can use IsFixedLength IIRC to make it into char

[17:31:33] <Beam> i'm having some issues with NetworkStream being affected by gui / threadpool load
[17:31:40] <jmer> Suchiman: ... Of course...
[17:31:42] * jmer facepalms
[17:31:53] <Beam> if i generate a lot of Tasks, NetworkStream will get hiccups and get laggy
[17:32:37] <Beam> total cpu of process is less than 2% so I don't really get how that can happen.
[17:34:44] <bomb> so you're doing networking in UI thread?
[17:35:22] <Beam> no
[17:35:29] <Beam> and I'm not even using async
[17:35:54] <Beam> it's all synchronous calls in a dedicated thread
[17:38:05] <Beam> It could be something related that just happens to affect NetworkStream when i debug. Basically i have a dedicated loop where i call some synchronous tcp operations, then after i get a result, i fire up a new task to send the data on it's way, and thread loops. (I realize creating tasks in this manner is wrong and I'm not doing it in production, but I'm doing it to test a hypothesis on another
[17:38:05] <Beam> issue)
[17:38:34] <bomb> Suchiman will solve your issue
[17:38:48] <Beam> is there a garbage collect happening on task creation that can pause a thread?
[17:38:55] <edcba> i'm not sure i should do some windows cmdline like: docker exec -it bla cat log* | bash -c jq
[17:38:57] <irwiss> Beam: tried queueing the data and running a single task to 'send' it?
[17:39:38] <Beam> irwiss: thanks, it's the plan, but again i'm doing this to purposely overload the thread pool to debug another issue
[17:39:58] <Suchiman> Beam: creating a Task incurs an allocation and if the GC has run out of allocation budget that will trigger a GC first which will pause the process for brief time
[17:40:27] <edcba> gc always run when you don't want to
[17:40:46] <Beam> Suchiman: Right, so you reckon given my description, that's what's happening?
[17:41:02] <Suchiman> Beam: when you're debugging and you have the diagnostic tools open, you can see if a GC is happening https://welp.dev/devenv_2022-02-23_15-10-51.png
[17:41:22] <Suchiman> Beam: the yellow upside down triangle will appear on the Process Memory chart
[17:42:22] <Beam> which window is this?
[17:42:31] <MatthiasVance> > and you have the diagnostic tools open
[17:44:31] <Beam> right found it. so it's not a GC
[17:44:46] <Beam> atleast not in that tool's sense
[17:45:16] <Suchiman> Beam: GC pauses should also be pretty short, if your heap size is like 500MB, then the pause time should be around 20ms
[17:45:33] <Beam> well i'm getting lag spikes around 300ms
[17:47:53] <Beam> hrrm. anything else I could check?
[17:49:12] <Beam> I guess it could still be some kind of thread/task pool cleanup even it doesn't show on GC ?
[17:49:15] <interop_madness> Beam, could your problem have to do anthing with this? https://stackoverflow.com/a/52394066/12058055
[17:49:59] <Beam> interop_madness: i don't see how? I'm not using async
[17:50:25] <interop_madness> Beam, ok, I assumed as much because you mentioned tasks
[17:55:38] <canton7> Beam, can you share your code? The thing that comes to mind is that you're saturating the ThreadPool, but I don't know whether that's plausible as I don't know how you're using it
[17:57:55] <Beam> canton7: did a profiling and doesn't seem like it; bit hard to share the code at the moment
[17:58:23] <canton7> Don't think I've ever seen a profiler report thread pool starvation

[18:00:20] <Beam> either way, I don't see how that could cause lock ups in a completely different area of code running in a dedicated thread?
[18:01:03] <Beam> best lead i have so far is some kind of garbage collection
[18:01:25] <Beam> but according to Suchiman they shouldn't be that long
[18:02:08] *** Joins: yano (~yano@ircpuzzles/staff/yano)
[18:02:29] <Beam> also if the freeze happened upon spawning the task, i'd get it, but it's happening deep inside a stream library, somewhere really unlikely
[18:08:03] <canton7> Beam, it happens when there are too many bits of blocking work for the threadpool threads which exist. The symptom is that the work just isn't scheduled until either a thread becomes free, or another one is spun up
[18:08:12] <canton7> And thread are only added at a rate of 2 per second IIRC
[18:08:33] <canton7> So it's entirely possible taht this results in callbacks just being delayed deep inside NetworkStream

[18:37:30] <bomb> okay website is broken, can't scroll down the line 29
[18:37:38] <edcba> but yeah i think you can find programs that automate mouse everywhere on internet
[18:37:49] <jennie> edcba i tried and they are not what I want
[18:37:53] <edcba> bomb: there is no more lines
[18:37:56] <jennie> else i wouldnt be coding one
[18:38:29] <edcba> well sometimes coders code things they didn't find on internet although it definitely exist
[18:38:29] <bomb> lol
[18:38:47] <jennie> whats wrong with my code that its locking computer?
[18:38:58] <edcba> you don't have a message loop
[18:39:22] <bomb> jennie what you want to do sounds exactly like my graduation thesis. maybe we should exchange communication information and hang around some time
[18:39:45] <edcba> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10658813/infinite-windows-message-loop something that looks like that
[18:40:29] <Babbage> looks like my iis problem from earlier is a file not found error, though what that file is, who knows!
[18:40:39] <edcba> but you probably lacks a lot more things then and it may not be what you really want...
[18:40:47] <bomb> we can solve your IIS problem together :)
[18:40:51] <jennie> edcba https://ideone.com/rXBKj0
[18:41:01] <edcba> Babbage: use process monitor too
[18:41:02] <bomb> wait it's not jenny oof piss off babbage
[18:41:04] <edcba> tool
[18:41:23] <edcba> jennie: you can't cut and paste code at random
[18:42:19] <edcba> i think coding that in c# would be easier too
[18:42:46] <bomb> jenni I bought a new car :)
[18:42:49] <edcba> or you can use some template with WinMain you may not need to code a message loop yourself
[18:42:56] <edcba> or use some c# winforms etc
[18:43:06] <jmer> bomb: come on man, you're better than this >.<

[18:44:20] <smitty> windbg has more cryptic commands than vim
[18:44:41] <edcba> yeah windbg sux a bit imo
[18:44:56] <smitty> i generally agree and i wish VS could load my 5.5 gb memory dump but here we are
[18:44:56] <edcba> probably better to try opening dumps with VS
[18:45:01] <edcba> oh
[18:45:26] <edcba> did you try with VS2022 ?
[18:45:29] <smitty> yeah
[18:45:37] <edcba> i thought it owuld solve all mem issues
[18:46:01] <bomb> that's overly optimistic
[18:46:02] <smitty> i run into this issue https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/debug-managed-memory-hangs-1/1536295

[19:03:10] <Beam> Hmm so it turns out my problem happens without all the task flooding as well, just way more rarely
[19:03:22] <Beam> I added tcpclient.NoDelay = true, and testing if that makes a difference
[19:03:31] *** Joins: fredrikhr (~fredrikhr@188.95.246.107)
[19:04:02] <brianonymous_> Beam: i missed your original problem. dead locks?
[19:04:24] <Beam> brianonymous_: random freezes in NetworkStream deep inside a library
[19:04:47] <Beam> that is stream.Read() seems to block when it shouldn't
[19:05:19] <Beam> been over possible garbage collection, or thread pool cleanups
[19:05:24] <brianonymous_> any chance its accidently mixing thread based lock primitives with async?
[19:05:43] <Beam> no i've completely avoided any kind of async (that i know of)
[19:06:33] <brianonymous_> i think the first thing id wanna do is get to the locked state and take a look at the parallel stacks
[19:06:36] <Beam> i have a tcp service i want to poll data of at the lowest possible latency, and i'm getting problems that overloading ui seems to affect the network layer
[19:07:00] <Beam> even though the network layer runs in a separate thread with all synchronous calls
[19:07:23] <Beam> i even have another thread to just check if data has changed, and run notifications up the tree
[19:07:59] <brianonymous_> are you using thread based locking stuff?
[19:08:30] <Beam> i'm lock()ing in the network thread, but in practice it will never hit a lock because it only happens at bootup
[19:08:58] <brianonymous_> is it easy to get into the lock state, or is it arbitrary
[19:09:20] <Beam> it's locking every network refresh (loop)
[19:09:45] <brianonymous_> thats actually good, it means it /should/ be pretty easy to hunt down
[19:09:56] <Beam> but again it's only one thread locking, except when added some stuff to a list which only happens at application startup
[19:10:56] <brianonymous_> im psycic debugging, but if you can look at the parallel stack window during lockup, you should be able to paint a picture on which threads are waiting on what
[19:11:12] *** Joins: ejjfunky2 (~ejjfunky@125.164.21.7)
[19:11:14] <irwiss> Beam: fwiw lock isn't instant, and it gets worse as the lock gets contested
[19:11:40] <Beam> well like i say it's just a single lock every loop, and each loop is atleast 10ms
[19:11:55] <Beam> that can't possibly make any congestion
[19:11:55] <brianonymous_> but clearly, something isnt getting released
[19:12:17] <Beam> well for the sake of clearing it up - i'll remove the lock
[19:12:32] <irwiss> you could try replacing the lock with something else, like a concurrentqueue, channel or whatever

[19:19:41] <jmer> MatthiasVance: The dudes that made Dark Souls is releasing a new game on Friday called Elden Ring... GRR Martin helped with the world building...
[19:20:21] <Xenoprimate> bomb I hope that was sarcasm
[19:20:25] <Xenoprimate> My ears are bleeding
[19:20:39] <Xenoprimate> jmer for sure, for sure. But I want it to be good. I need another Dark Souls xP
[19:20:45] <bomb> XD
[19:21:46] <jmer> Xenoprimate: From what I've read they have fixed a lot of the stuff that has annoyed me with the Souls games i.e. I felt constrained in the world and Elden Ring is open world. Dark souls color palette was at times very depressing and Elden Ring seems brighter and more colorfoul and Magic/ranged builds should be even more viable than ever... And yeah you can jump
[19:21:59] <bomb> jmer https://www.amazon.com/Penis-Rings/b?node=1243852011
[19:22:00] <jmer> I mean... Real jump not just the run+ thumbstick BS

[19:22:23] <jmer> MatthiasVance: It's good but hard.
[19:22:38] <jmer> Sekiro is fucking awesome but I sucked so hard at the parry mechanic I had to give up when I hit the first real boss :(
[19:22:46] <Xenoprimate> I didn't like Sekiro at all
[19:22:47] <bomb> hard, yeah. like a broomstick
[19:22:54] <Xenoprimate> Parrying was always my least favourite mechanic
[19:22:58] <jmer> Xenoprimate: I liked the style but the parry crap was simply too hard for me
[19:23:19] <jmer> Xenoprimate: I think I dislike parry mechanic because I always suck at it.
[19:23:24] <jmer> in all games I suck at parrying xD
[19:23:34] <Xenoprimate> My style was always dual-wield, quick hits, speedy builds, super fast rolls, etc
[19:23:43] <Xenoprimate> Haha me too, me too
[19:23:54] <jmer> Xenoprimate: I've never gone further than the "stack strength and life" builds xD
[19:24:01] <Xenoprimate> Haha, fair!

[19:24:13] <Xenoprimate> Video gamez
[19:24:23] <bomb> ah
[19:24:51] <jmer> Xenoprimate: I would like to though, but then the depressing worlds held me back... Or I felt trapped when I hit a difficulty wall and my definition of fun isn't farming the same mobs over and over until you have enough souls for the next level up
[19:27:25] <Xenoprimate> I love the depressing worlds, myself (if you saw my twitter avatar you'd know instantly what kind of aesthetic I like xD) but I 100% agree on the farming/grinding
[19:27:34] <Xenoprimate> Miss me with any game that makes me feel like I'm doing work
[19:27:52] <jmer> It a varies with my mood how tolerable I am of depressing worlds
[19:28:19] <jmer> I think DS3 even lightened the tone a bit and it's a lot more tolerable for me than DS1 and 2
[19:29:29] <Xenoprimate> DS3 has the best gameplay for sure
[19:29:36] <Xenoprimate> But I felt the environments were often a bit samey

[20:34:34] <DevJohnC> Steam isn't even installed on this machine any more

[23:38:16] <MatthiasVance> ben is right ;)
[23:38:47] <biberu> MatthiasVance: citizens are burgers? ðŸ˜±
[23:38:52] <MatthiasVance> Yes :D
[23:39:08] <ben> it's BÃ¼rger in german
[23:39:11] <MatthiasVance> What if you need burger service though.. you need to call the burger service number and they will ask you for your burger service number
[23:39:25] <biberu> hambÃ¼rger?
[23:39:29] <ben> do they need your burger service number at burger king too?
[23:40:56] <biberu> burger koning*

[23:41:18] <MatthiasVance> ^
[23:41:22] <biberu> is the burger koning also a burger?
[23:41:38] <MatthiasVance> I am not sure how that works
[23:41:50] <MatthiasVance> I mean obviously not in the term.. but he would need to have a number as well? xD
[23:44:12] <biberu> i don't know, since i don't work at the burger number service i didn't need to ask the burger koning for his burger service number yet
[23:50:48] <lz_> MatthiasVance: I've almost shipped a product ! :D I've passed nearly all technical requirements. Main show stopper was, they wanted to be sure I owned the copyrights lol
[23:51:13] <lz_> MatthiasVance: in the checklist they have things like "product contains good design and concepts" and it's all green, I'm happy
[23:51:40] <lz_> MatthiasVance: however I don't expect to make more than 20 bucks a month :D
[23:52:45] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Oh that is cool! So you have a first customer?
[23:52:56] <lz_> no, just waiting for the publisher's approval first
[23:53:11] <MatthiasVance> ahh, publishing it to a marketplace?
[23:53:15] <lz_> yes
[23:53:30] <MatthiasVance> What is the product? :D
[23:53:40] <lz_> i told you :P PM
[23:55:26] <MatthiasVance> PM is the product. I have a competing product.. AM!
