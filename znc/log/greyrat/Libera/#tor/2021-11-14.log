[20:00:57] <hazeyez> <DJKuhpisse> What type of website you are looking for?
[20:05:21] <hazeyez> anything that is not a marketplace, not on the clearweb, not a scam - i'm just new to the darkweb and i'm trying to convince myself that it's not all just a bunch of BS. To me it seems like all it is - is an overwhelmingly good place to get ripped off for illegal shit. I'd be interested in hacking/security websites/blogs/info groups, good chats, free redrooms that "role play" and nothing ridiculously 
[20:05:21] <hazeyez> illegal (if they exist) any blogs in general that are good reads on things that cannot be found on clearweb
[20:05:39] <hazeyez> certainly no pr0n or cp/candy
[20:10:19] <hazeyez> idk to me it seems like when you're new to the darkweb via tor - there's nothing that catches your attention. to me it seems like a bunch of marketplaces and dumb shit - i try to look at directories and 50% of links dont work, 25% are available on clearnet (new york times, for exmaple) and the last 25% are a combo of marketplaces, porn and dumb shit - not exactly why i'm going on there
[20:10:35] <hazeyez> i found ransomware dumps which is pretty cool, i guess
[20:12:26] <hazeyez> i guess im just trying to figure out how to navigate, where to find the cool stuff, how to chat, how to discover some hacking groups, blogs -- and enjoy it without having to just test directory links and deal with marketplaces
