[02:15:35] <rdrg109> [Q] I want to store the current timestamp in the CREATED property whenever a new node is created. Do any of you have any idea on how to accomplish this?
[04:52:30] <rdrg109> lockywolf: I tried using org-ql, but the problem is that, apparently, it can't return the top level of the document even though it is a match for the executed query. This means that if you are storing each node as a separated file, you can't perform queries in the nodes that you have created. I've opened an issue on this ( https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/253 )

[18:51:26] <niemand> Hi, i just had the same question like https://www.reddit.com/r/OrgRoam/comments/nshzel/add_properties_to_orgroamcapturetemplates/; since nobody has answered them yet, i'm bringing it up here.

[19:58:28] <rdrg109> niemand: I'm also interested in that one, I would like to store a timestamp in the CREATED property. I'll let you know if I find something relevant
[19:59:08] <niemand> rdrg109: i have the exact same usecase
[20:00:21] <niemand> also: let Tisoxin now instead of me (Tisoxin is me on matrix)
