[00:06:08] <ggreer> eg: they didn't track whether the people who were hospitalized due to e coli were reusable bag users or not
[00:06:25] <ggreer> I mean... how can one even determine that information without interviewing everyone?
[00:06:48] <ggreer> > The Klick & Wright study is classified as an ecological study; that is, if factor A (reusable
[00:06:48] <ggreer> bags) increased in a location, and then factor B (gastrointestinal bacterial infections) increase
[00:06:49] <ggreer> in the same location, therefore, factor A caused factor B. Drawing causal conclusions from

[00:11:23] <two2thehead> Mildly interesting
[00:14:58] <ggreer> they looked at bag bans in other counties in california. every single place that banned disposable plastic bags had an increase in ER admissions for e coli. p values were < 0.01
[00:15:31] <ggreer> > Our results suggest that the San Francisco ban led to, conservatively, 5.4 annual additional deaths.

[04:40:23] <feepbot> it’s said, the seeds were planted in tropical greenhouses, and the trees that grew were carried off to Ceylan (Sri Lanka). But the story isn’t at all true! Queen Victoria personally, and officially, asked for hevea seeds for Kew Gardens. Honored by the request, the Brazilians obliged. The first seeds didn’t survive the long voyage by sail, as they only live for three weeks.
[04:40:23] <feepbot> It took a steamboat for new ones to reach England in a sufficiently good state to sprout in hothouses there. The rubber trees obtained in this manner then made their way to Malaysia, where plantations flourished — as they did in Ceylan and throughout Southeast Asia.

[07:55:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh come on
[07:55:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> We've discussed sixels in here multiple times!
[07:56:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> "At the heart of the 'free' software model there is an economic hole.
[07:56:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> In Bryan Lunduke's interview with Stallman, broadcast in 2012, this hole opened up. Lunduke sought Stallman's advice on how to move his business to free software. Lunduke's business was selling video games for a few dollars. Not something that required support, teaching or handholding. Writing programs was, Lunduke asserted, one of the few things he could do well and feed his family. How could he give away his work under GPL
[07:56:13] <Obormot\Arcturus>  and make money? Stallman simply asserted that Lunduke should not engage in making money from closed source. Lunduke was shocked to realise that Stallman had no economic ideas to offer. 
[07:56:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> > I was a little disappointed in one thing. I feel we did not get practical solutions. I kind of went to this interview thinking 'I'm going to ask directly Richard Stallman on what I can do. How to I take a proprietary software business and move it?' You know, move it over to Free Software. I wanted some ideas. My thought was 'I'm going to disagree with some of his ideas. I'll think they're crazy.' But I was expecting ideas
[07:56:13] <Obormot\Arcturus>  and what I was going to do was take those and apply those to one piece of my software and see how it goes . .... And it turns out that Richard Stallman has absolutely no practical ideas of how to move over from proprietary to free software. He just thinks my child shouldn't eat food."

[08:07:32] <Robomot> Biography
[08:08:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After seven years of the new regime [of letting students pick what classes they took to satisfy CS degree reqs], I had the opportunity to compare the class of 1999 with the class of 1992. In 1992 I set an course in Artificial Intelligence requiring students to solve six exercises, including building a Prolog interpreter. In 1999, six exercises had shrunk to one; which was a 12 line Prolog program for which eight weeks were
[08:08:06] <Obormot\Arcturus>  allotted for students to write it. A special class was laid on for students to learn this and many attended, including students who had attended a course incorporating logic programming the previous term. It was a battle to get the students to do this, not least because two senior lecturers criticised the exercise as presenting too much of a challenge to the students."
[08:08:38] <gwern> 'And this, really, is not a great surprise, because landmark papers in any discipline are few and far between. Mozarts are rare and to be valued, but the counterfeit academic Mozarts are common and a contributory cause to global warming and deforestation. The whole enterprise of counting publications as a means to evaluating research excellence is pernicious and completely absurd. If a 12...

[09:18:03] <quanticle> Procedures can call functions

[09:18:43] <nshepperd2> yes, so how do you read a string
[09:18:53] <quanticle> Anyway, from what I've read of this blogpost, it seems like with the distinction between functions and procedures, this person has reinvented monads
[09:18:57] <quanticle> But in a really terrible way
[09:19:01] <nshepperd2> 'read' can't be a function, because manipulating a file is a side effect
[09:19:16] <nshepperd2> but it can't be a procedure, because it has to return a string, duh
[09:19:30] <rmmh> nshepperd2: it works great for bash

[19:58:17] <feepbot> Britain Signals Intent to Revert to the Imperial System - The New York Times (The government announced plans to allow shops to sell produce in pounds and ounces, rather than using the metric system, as part of an effort to "capitalize on new Brexit freedoms.”)
[20:00:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The government announced plans to allow shops to sell produce in pounds and ounces, rather than using the metric system, as part of an effort to “capitalize on new Brexit freedoms.”" ... I mean, this seems fine?
[20:01:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's actually kind of weird that the government would be mandating this (either way) in the first place
[20:01:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why do shops need the government to "allow" them to sell things in whatever measurements they want
[20:01:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> So insofar as this is a reduction in government control of everyday life, it seems like a good thing
[20:02:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> "While the European Union currently requires members to use the metric system alone, it had allowed Britain, when it was a member, to label its produce in imperial units alongside metric units. There were also exceptions for traffic signs and beer." ... right, so, this just seems like an obvious case of excessive government intrusion
[20:02:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reversing that is good
[20:03:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> "As part of its exit from the European Union, the British government is now reviewing thousands of E.U. rules that it retained and determining whether they best serve the national interest. Those rules include the E.U. ban on sales in imperial units, which the British government said it would legislate changes to “in due course.”" ... this is excellent! Yes!
[20:04:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Now, if they were to *mandate* the use of imperial units - that would be bad, as it would defeat the point. But it does not seem like they're doing that, at all)
[20:05:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Supporters of the metric system say its use is necessary for companies to compete globally, since so many countries use it." ... well, by all means, keep using it, who's stopping you
[20:07:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> If it's a competitive advantage to use metric, then companies that use metric will outcompete companies that use imperial, and the problem will solve itself, especially since currently metric is already entrenched, so there's not even an incumbency obstacle

The shooter adjusted the sights and fired another burst, hitting the windshield at
[20:43:18] <feepbot> least three times and Mr. Fakhrizadeh at least once in the shoulder. He stepped out of the car and crouched behind the open front door. According to Iran’s Fars News, three more bullets tore into his spine. He collapsed on the road. The first bodyguard arrived from a chase car: Hamed Asghari, a national judo champion, holding a rifle. He looked around for the assailant, seemingly

She sat on the ground and held his head on her lap, she told Iranian state television. The blue Zamyad exploded. That was the only part of the operation that did not go as planned. The explosion was intended to rip the robot to shreds so the Iranians

Instead, most of the equipment was hurled into the air and then fell to the ground, damaged beyond repair but largely intact...The entire operation took less than a minute.

[23:35:51] <mst> in that once you tell it to close a tab the keyboard input is still captured by the closing tab rather than queued for whatever has focus next
[23:35:56] <mst> made it completely unusable to me

[23:36:51] <feep> wow that's shit
[23:36:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Firefox does that too
[23:37:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does it with new tabs too, you open a new tab and it doesn't start getting input until seconds later
[23:37:04] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: not for me
[23:37:07] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[23:37:34] <mst> I have a strong reflex of doing Ctrl-W, Ctrl-T, <type url>, <enter>
[23:37:46] <mst> this works in firefox. last time I tried chrome it really really didn't work at all.
[23:37:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> I had that once but modern browsers un-trained me from it
[23:37:56] <rmmh> works fast enough for me?
[23:37:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> It hasn't worked in any browser whatsoever in years
[23:38:05] <rmmh> never seen the multi-second lag there
[23:38:39] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: I find in FF there's sometimes a bit of a -delay- but no input is dropped

[23:39:32] <mst> whereas chrome would reliably eat the first half of the URL I went on to type
[23:39:38] <mst> did my fucking head in
[23:39:52] <PapuaHardyNet> you can do a search for open windows. This way you can have, say, a hundred tabs open as windows, and then search via name
[23:40:07] <mst> entirely possible a newer build of chrome or faster hardware would be better but I have zero motivation to try
[23:40:13] <quanticle> The reason I don't use Chrome is because inserting into the middle of a big textarea sucks: https://jsfiddle.net/rfok412e/

[23:40:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I use Quicksilver, which is similar, but again, it's not useful when you have 550 tabs
[23:40:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: No, in my experience newer Chromes aren't better at this at all

[23:41:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[23:42:07] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Scroll down a ways, and try to insert a newline
[23:42:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Ok? And then?
[23:42:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> nm I see it
[23:42:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow.
[23:43:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow that's so bad
[23:43:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Explain the %foo thing plz
[23:44:02] <quanticle> Yeah, it was something I discovered once pages on my wiki got large.
[23:44:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[23:44:58] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: e.g. if I have a netflix tab ... somewhere ... I can do Ctrl-T, %netf, enter to jump to that tab
[23:45:20] <mst> % basically means "treat what I'm typing in the URL bar as a search of my existing tabs rather than my history"
[23:45:34] <PapuaHardyNet> really? I need to press the down arrow key or it searches instead of switching
[23:45:58] <quanticle> But why do you need to open a new tab for that? Why not hit ctrl-L to jump to the URL bar for the current tab?
[23:46:02] <mst> (might need to be %netf, down, enter, this is built into my fingers now)
[23:46:12] <mst> quanticle: ... this is to jump to an *existing* tab
[23:46:32] <saturn2> firefox's input queuing was broken in version 57
[23:46:34] <mst> it might work with the current tab's URL bar, I've never tried
[23:46:50] <saturn2> they still haven't fixed it and never will
[23:47:15] <quanticle> Yes, that's what I mean. I just tried it. Ctrl-L %gre and it brought up the tab for Greater Wrong, and I was able to jump to it without opening a new tab.
[23:47:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Huh, weird. I know this feature you are referring to but it doesn't require typing any % or anything special at all
[23:47:54] <saturn2> ctrl-t and immediately typing something results in only the last half of what i type going in the url bar
[23:47:59] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: you're not thinking.
[23:48:03] <PapuaHardyNet> what do you mean by broken input queueing
[23:48:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Explain
[23:48:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[23:48:25] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: % *only* works on current tabs. without the % you get a history search etc. as well. this is messier results wise.
[23:48:42] <saturn2> also typing something too fast and pressing enter results in firefox only registering the first half of what i typed
[23:48:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: same
[23:48:56] <mst> quanticle: my reflex is to use a sacrificial fresh tab for things, it disappears when I jump to it
[23:49:07] <mst> I mean, when I jump to the tab I was targeting
[23:49:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Hm, I see, I see
[23:49:42] <mst> I find the reduced results clutter makes my life better; if it doesn't help you, I guess don't use the feature :D
[23:49:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle's approach is better for sure
[23:49:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's actually more clutter with your method
[23:49:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even if it's temporary clutter
[23:50:13] <mst> no, obormot, I meant results clutter being reduced by the % part
[23:50:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, sure
[23:50:24] <mst> the sacrificial empty tab thing was -not- what the clutter part was referring to at all
[23:50:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> k
[23:50:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I meant that using the current tab is better
[23:50:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Than making a new tab
[23:50:43] <mst> probably, but finger macros
[23:50:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[23:51:40] <mst> also I basically only ever use the current tab's URL bar if I want to change the current tab's actual URL and so retraining my mental model would be effort I can't be bothered making
[23:52:32] <quanticle> Okay, there's one big problem with that that % approach. If you have more than one tab open with the same title, %<tab name> only brings up the first tab, and doesn't show any of the subsequent ones.
[23:52:44] * quanticle uses his wiki's sandbox page as a scratchpad
[23:53:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: I sympathize with that, which is why I was averse to even trying to use the current tab's URL bar for this, despite having thought "does this work? maybe it does"
[23:53:04] <quanticle> So I'll often have more than one wikisandbox page open for editing, with random snippets in it
[23:53:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then quanticle just told me it works so, great
