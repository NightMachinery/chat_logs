[00:17:00] <sd> 11<r​ixo> And to clarify, the manual will refer to major, minor and point PHP releases. Using PHP 7.3.1 as an example, the 7 refers to the major version, 3 to minor, and 1 is the point release. Typically PHP only adds new features to major and minor releases, and fixes bugs in point releases. However, this convention is not always true.

[02:09:27] <oxipital> you contract with me to replicate your service in k8 containers as needed to meet surge demand
[02:09:38] <signalblue> sharkygator: that's an odd thing to do
[02:09:43] <iphone> oxipital: thats basically aws lambda
[02:09:56] <oxipital> even better
[02:09:59] <iphone> or any serverless service
[02:10:15] <oxipital> i just resell lambda with the work to replicate their app server
[02:10:22] <oxipital> and necessary db servers
[02:10:37] <signalblue> what the heck is reverse API
[02:10:45] <shakygator> its API documentation, but we're not an API, its just documentation, but we also make API calls out to various tenants and pull/host their docs
[02:11:15] <Cl0udNinja> its an api wrapper for apis
[02:11:28] <shakygator> not even, but i dont know, and i dont really care. im infra
[02:11:34] <shakygator> ask the backend guys
[02:12:50] <e1> "It's an api to the api" lmfao
[02:12:58] <e1> I'm not even surprised for a second that exists
[02:13:13] <e1> and if oyu tell me it's written in node, I wouldn't even blink
[02:13:14] <Cl0udNinja> iit happens a lot
[02:13:30] <shakygator> its definitely written in node
[02:13:31] <e1> people are stupid
[02:13:33] <shakygator> react/golang
[02:13:42] <Cl0udNinja> the VR place I worked, we had a whole api subset dedicated to purchases/sales that were basically shortcut wrappers to the payment gateway
[02:13:47] <shakygator> and no, its not an api wrapper cuz that would mean we take api calls, which we dont
[02:13:54] <Cl0udNinja> and the payment gateway has its wrapper to handle multiple payment processors
[02:14:25] <shakygator> we have certain tenants, and they are boarded and have some guidelines, and we make API calls to them to pull data. so instead of them hosting their own api docs, we do it (cuz they are using our APIs already i think - not ones we host here)
[02:14:32] <signalblue> it's gonna become a big mess
[02:14:33] <e1> ehhh that's mildly reasonable Cl0udNinja 
[02:14:38] <oxipital> you know, if you could shift that start menu around, i think a lot of the whining about windows 11 would disappear

[02:14:43] <signalblue> LOL

[02:14:50] <signalblue> Windows 11 is going to be awesome

[02:14:55] <iphone> it looks like xfce from 10 years ago
[02:14:57] <shakygator> Cl0udNinja, yeah this is a payment API
[02:15:15] <signalblue> Remember... every other version of Windows is good
[02:15:23] <shakygator> but this is the developer portal for how other companies, or tenants, build their payment gateways
[02:15:42] <signalblue> so this is kinda like a middleman
[02:15:52] <shakygator> its not, because we are THE payment processor

[04:50:50] <e1> Yeah it's crazy how things have changed. Discords kinda killed it the culture. Guilded have the right idea i reckon but getting people to port over is hard
[04:50:52] <SleePy> I've googled around and can't find it.  We stopped using it in 2012 when we went to FreeNode.
[04:51:03] <e1> It was weird being in GSF because they have an actual fully functioning, very active forum
[04:51:10] <e1> It's 99% shit posting, but still amazing
[04:51:32] <e1> I vaguely remember something about the village, but i might be thinking of the name of a shopping center where i lived
[04:51:34] <SleePy> Forums are very much good for that.  Your comment doesn't get lost in the sea of social media style postings
[04:52:20] <e1> Also the format forces a much higher posting standard
[04:52:30] <e1> I really miss having all that information available to me. It's a huge shame
[04:53:09] <e1> Dont worry, we'll always have #freenode-bbs - the new frontier of irc
[04:54:34] <SpeakerToMeat> forums have different uses partly
[04:54:39] <SleePy> Good luck with that.
[04:55:02] <SleePy> We just killed FreeNode on our relay bot.  Since it can't connect anyways.  Far as I'm concerned, FreeNode doesn't exist anymore
[04:55:21] <SpeakerToMeat> SleePy, but... #linux is full!
[04:55:24] <SpeakerToMeat> 411 people!
[04:55:25] <iphone> JollyRgrs: what rank in RL
[04:56:02] <SleePy> Whats funny is I couldn't connect to the new FreeNode on my bouncer.  Because my SASL was setup to require auth.  So connection was failing.
[04:56:02] <JollyRgrs> eh, kinda on a roller coaster atm... i was as high as mid C2 a few seasons ago
[04:56:33] <iphone> ah. I'm D2 I think. Topped out at D3. Game pisses me off nowadays
[04:56:39] <JollyRgrs> SleePy: yeah, it doesn't exist anymore... it's a completely new system, just using the old name
[04:57:14] <SleePy> Well last night you could still get on the old one still.  I didn't know if any orphaned servers still exist

[04:58:33] <e1> No point clinging if you're going to stay connected, sadly
[04:59:13] <e1> JollyRgrs: did you guys set fn#r-s to be invite only?
[04:59:37] <SleePy> Although I'm sure most of you here agree, with how I saw the rollout happen.  I really hope I never hire that tech.  That are a horrible rollout
[05:00:12] <e1> SleePy: your'e not a fan of announcing new features without having them implemented?
[05:00:15] <mistiry> SleePy: they shut off the remaining "classic" servers a few hours ago
[05:00:19] <e1> idk, seemed like a big dick move.
[05:00:23] <mistiry> of course, they blamed the users for it
[05:00:40] <e1> The users! Of course! Even when it was the admins, I always knew it was the users!
[05:00:54] <mistiry> "THE COMMUNITY HAS SPOKEN!" meanawhile tons of people joining going "uhh why is my nick gone??!?"
[05:01:24] <e1> "spoken"
[05:01:30] <e1> the words were put in our mouth
[05:01:32] <SleePy> e1: More of how they just started pulling random servers to rebuild them with the new software, then it ended up with netsplits with 4 separate networks existing.  Their web irc not connecting to their new irc, services not working correctly on both old and new
[05:02:07] <e1> SleePy: the basic synopsis is they have absolutely zero clue of what they're doing.
[05:02:17] <SleePy> Seemed like to me, there was no plan in place.  Just rip and replace and not care what broke
[05:02:18] <e1> And did absolutely zero DD with anything
[05:02:51] <SleePy> Exactly.  Poorly planned.  Not event talking why they did it, I'm focusing on the implantation and rollout.
[05:03:27] <e1> I'm happy to be proven wrong, but they're just faking it till they make it. Now they're repeating a narrative to re-inforce in peoples minds that it's true, but it's so half-heartedly done that even the ops in #freenode are sounding tired
[05:04:27] <e1> I will say, I'm a big fan of auto masking people.
[05:04:28] <SleePy> You mean the ops that couldn't fix netsplits?
[05:04:35] <e1> hehehe yeah those guys
[05:04:50] <e1> I noticed mboss doesn't appear to be staff anymore
[05:05:27] <SleePy> I was on the side of the netsplit with that oper, who didn't know what to do to fix it..  Hes a @ in #freenode and doesn't know how to fix a netsplit.  Like when the CEO wants domain admin rights...

[05:28:12] <SleePy> So a vendor replaced a sorting PC on our line.  They water cooled the system because there is 4x 2080 TIs in it doing sorting.  So they dumped the radiator into the water system on the line.  Chlorinated water + radiator sounds like this will end well.
[05:28:45] <JollyRgrs> vendor did that?

[06:07:04] <jimender2> and users
[06:07:05] *** BWMerlin26 is now known as Work-BWMerlin
[06:08:04] <SleePy> You don't wnat to see the app I built entirely in SQL to consume the API from our time keeping system, normalize the data and send up only changed data to our data warehouse.
[06:08:19] <SleePy> The main script is about 6k lines of SQL...
[06:09:43] <e1> 6k holy shit
[06:09:55] <jimender2> We have scripts to populate tables automatically from random other tables and normalize it.  It also goes and sends / receives from Kafka and keeps track of everything in a factory
[06:11:29] <SleePy> e1: Well the API was JSON with hierarchy.  SQL doesn't do that.  So I had to flatten all the data, before I could work through the data to normalize it, determine if data in normalized tables needed updates, then merge them up.  Once that is all done and everything happy, I can kick off a sync between the staging system and production system to update the warehouse
[06:11:31] <jimender2> Some of our code requires blood sacrifices
[06:12:02] <jimender2> Kafka requires everything to be in JSON so I know the struggle
[06:13:08] <SleePy> jimender2: My struggle is our production SQL server is 2014.  So our staging system is 2017 express.. The pain to make things work because I couldn't use the 2014 server and express has some limitations which was mostly jobs
[06:14:13] <jimender2> I use SQL Server old new and inbetween and various forms of MySQL and MariaDB along with some data lakes/oceans
[06:15:01] <SleePy> Nice.  We technically have a DB2 database, but thats about it.  TSQL for the win.
[06:15:19] <jimender2> Forgot about sqlite
[06:16:33] <SleePy> ODBC connectors are nice.  We just use that to link all other sql servers into our main and then query using standard sql syntax and things work perfect.  Although for some tables, we build it into a @table first with a Openquery call because we can improve efficiency and speed greatly
[06:19:38] <jimender2> The main platform that we use has what is called a prep statement that allows you to add "variables" to your sql query that auto sanitizes the parameters which is super nice
[06:20:05] <SleePy> That for BI data?
[06:20:48] <SleePy> I've only seen pre statements used in code.  Not in SQL (in things like USPs) unless it needs to dynamically build some SQL

[06:23:56] <SleePy> Although one of our BI team has done something really cool in SQL.  He took csv files that have varying column lengths and figured out how to properly read all the columns into a readable table to be parsed with some pivots into some readable reports.  Fancy stuff

[06:29:06] <SleePy> Yea.  We have lots of scada systems.  We are agricultural.  So irrigation controls and refrigeration controls.  Then we have packing operations.  So tons of scada to run all that equipment.
[06:30:02] <jimender2> We have a light in our shop that shows if the bathroom is in use or not.  I am trying to hook it into ignition so we can calculate the OEE time of it and prove we need another bathroom.
[06:30:14] <SleePy> We have some areas that the pumps can only pump so much water, otherwise we will blow things up.  Its carefully programmed to only allow so many gallons per second through the system.
[06:31:42] <jimender2> Ive done some scada mes for beverage companies.  Ive seen things to make me not drink anything from them
[06:32:18] <SleePy> I've worked for a MSP.  I've seen some restaurants that make me not want to eat at them.
[06:32:33] <SleePy> When the router up in the attic is greasy.. You know things are gross..
[06:32:38] <jimender2> Same with car parts.  I ordered some parts the other day and when I got them, I checked to make sure they did not come from certain plants since I know the quality of work there.

[06:34:12] <evilgohan2> SleePy: a good indicator of the conditions of a restaurant: the bathrooms
[06:34:25] <evilgohan2> A poorly maintained bathroom will say A LOT about a restaurant.
[06:34:35] <evilgohan2> Especially if the staff are using it.
[06:34:37] <SleePy> Yet being in ag.  I've seen the worse and best of some of the operations.  I'm proud to say, our org is on the best.  I've been in some packing sheds and things where dirty as can be.
[06:36:23] <SleePy> Best thing about ag.  Farmers are very smart actually.  Something breaks and they got duck tape and bailing wire out to fix it.  And they don't intend for it to be a temp fix.  They wire it back together and it will be there for the next 10 years working :\
[06:37:03] <sd> 05<n​openopeynope> One thing that always bugs me in restaurants is the soda. I can tell when the lines haven't been cleaned. Tastes like mold. I can tell right when we get our drinks if the place is secretly dirty

[06:43:08] <SleePy> n​emisys:  It isn't good.  Lots of the smaller farms are going under.  Luckily bigger farms are picking them up fairly quickly, so the supply won't change.  Just a lot less independent farmers.

[06:45:09] <sd> 10<n​emisys> SleePy: seems like everything is going that way these days.  I try to buy the organic meat at the store (because it tastes better).  hopefully it comes from a smaller farm.
[06:45:46] <SleePy> I don't know much about meats, but in fruits.  My farmers have explained organic fruit is really stupid.
[06:46:46] <SleePy> All the chemicals put on organics or traditional are made from natural stuff from earth.  But by putting organic on there and using different chemicals, customers are willing to pay way more for worse quality fruit
[06:47:26] <sd> 10<n​emisys> blame facebook
[06:49:41] <SleePy> Our company tries to use less chemicals (because they are expensive and when you have miles of orchards it adds up).  But those same chemicals do things like keep bugs away, allow it to ripen and color better and gain greater sizes.  So its a choice really.
[06:50:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[06:50:25] <sd> 10<n​emisys> I can tell you this, the tomatoes I buy at albertsons are way better than the ones I get at restaurants

[06:54:40] <SleePy> Fruit grows until you pick it.  Once you pick it, thats its peak.  Some fruit can gain a bit more sugars after, but otherwise thats it.  So by the time you get it, its been degrading for a while.  Depending on what fruit it is, this can be weeks or months since it was picked

[08:40:07] <riff-IRC> [JUN 12 1992 15:04:26] <GC3> Generator 23 (1990 CAT D2500XL) Offline - Coolant Level Too Low - Check coolant level in water system and refill to system capacity of 25.00 US gallons. Current level estimated at: 7.12 US gallons. System Status: LOSTGEN/505 Event ID 1256
[08:42:14] <riff-IRC> [JUN 12 1992 15:04:30] <GC3> Generator 23 automatic shutdown in 30 seconds.
[08:42:34] <Church> Hmm?
[08:43:03] <Virtual-Potato> someone needs to sync that host with their NTP server
[08:43:03] <riff-IRC> Had a coolant system pressure valve fail on a generator in June 1992.
[08:43:10] <riff-IRC> lol
[08:43:21] <Virtual-Potato> there's a nearly 30 year offseet
[08:44:29] <riff-IRC> System got hot, water expanded and boiled out, generator went offline under normal operation, water cooled, generator started and brought online again, controller senses lack of water pressure, flow rate, and general water level, and trips it offline due to low water level.
[08:46:42] <riff-IRC> Changed the 25PSI valve, refilled the system, and did an air purge, and it was back up and running.
[08:47:33] <riff-IRC> The found that the expensive pressure valves last between 20 and 30 years.
[08:48:00] <a1> FAKE
[08:48:01] <a1> NEWS
[08:48:04] <riff-IRC> The midrange valves go about 15-20 years, and the cheap valves go to about 5 years before sticking open or closed.
[08:48:29] <a1> no one uses generators anymore man, come on
[08:48:41] <csws> well

[08:49:15] <a1> no, we just attach to three power grids
[08:49:20] <a1> penis, yes
[08:49:26] <csws> lol that isn't even a guarantee
[08:49:28] <riff-IRC> Also issued a bugfix to GC3 to fix the water system fault detection subsystem, bringing the GC3 build revision to 1289.13323.
[08:49:35] <csws> I worked in a building on two separate grids and it still went down
[08:49:39] <a1> nope
[08:49:40] <csws> and guess what
[08:49:41] <a1> impossible
[08:49:42] <csws> the genny worked
[08:49:45] <csws> the transfer switch did not!
[08:49:49] <riff-IRC> lol
[08:49:57] <e1> rip lol
[08:50:28] <riff-IRC> Our build systems were friggin insane.
[08:50:53] <Virtual-Potato> instead of worrying about generators
[08:50:57] <Virtual-Potato> just get a really big UPS
[08:50:59] <Virtual-Potato> like, really big
[08:51:15] <a1> like gas power plant size
[08:51:22] <Virtual-Potato> bigger
[08:51:28] <a1> two gas power plant size
[08:51:37] <SleePy> But why?  generators are far much cheaper
[08:51:40] <Virtual-Potato> idk man that might be too big
[08:51:55] <csws> Virtual-Potato with his unlimited battery budget
[08:52:04] <Virtual-Potato> ok SleePy go and watch your generators fail
[08:52:12] <Virtual-Potato> I'll be here laughing with the power on
[08:52:23] * csws watches Virtual-Potato's 60 kVA inverter explode spectacularly
[08:52:32] <SleePy> ok, well equipment powers down then and then we bring in the portable and we are up and running again
[08:52:52] <Virtual-Potato> but equipment can't power down
[08:52:55] <Virtual-Potato> they can't be down
[08:52:56] <SleePy> It does weekly run tests to verify it is running well
[08:53:01] <Virtual-Potato> gotta strive for that 100% uptime
[08:53:04] <riff-IRC> Quad 900MB ESDI drives held the build files and raw source code.
[08:53:14] <csws> Virtual-Potato striving for 6 9s
[08:53:29] <Virtual-Potato> no, I'm striving for no nines, and one 100
[08:53:29] <riff-IRC> That was the build core fileserver soft.
[08:53:30] <SleePy> I had a switch pop once.  It had a 3 year uptime.  That was when I plugged it in last.
[08:53:51] <riff-IRC> s/soft/host.
[08:53:52] <csws> was it dual PSU?
[08:53:52] <layer8> riff-IRC meant: "That was the build core fileserver host.."
[08:54:03] <SleePy> nope
[08:54:17] <csws> probably would've gotten 3 more with a 2nd PSU
[08:54:29] <SleePy> Popped, and lots of zabbix alerts.  But nothing went down.  But with a loss of a switch and a few mpio paths, things where angry 
[08:54:29] <Virtual-Potato> or both would fail at the same time
[08:54:46] <csws> yeah I've got zabbix setup
[08:54:53] <csws> finally got a real test of it
[08:54:57] <csws> esxi host exploded
[08:55:10] <csws> this is a homelab cluster at least
[08:55:12] <csws> but no redundancy so lol
[08:55:14] <a1> should have had a power plant
[08:55:17] <Virtual-Potato> I can't afford zabbix, so I'm using wabbix
[08:55:32] <SleePy> wabbix season?
[08:55:42] <csws> imo you should try the fork yabbix, it has a new feature where it just doesn't tell you about alerts and gives you 100% uptime graphs for those KPIs
[08:55:49] <riff-IRC> Cue a dual pair of custom 486 systems, each with a dedicated 7.2GB disk array for storage and scratch space. 384MB of RAM between them, so 96MB per system.
[08:56:02] <Virtual-Potato> lmfao csws 
[08:56:15] <csws> riff-IRC: 96*2 is 192MB
[08:56:25] <riff-IRC> Dual pair = 4
[08:56:28] <csws> oh
[08:56:58] <Virtual-Potato> "with our new neverfail system, you can guarantee 100% uptime with our patented neverpoll technology!"
[08:57:10] <riff-IRC> Still insane for systems that we built in 1990 using 1989 hardware.
[08:57:13] <Virtual-Potato> it just assumes everything is up
[08:58:39] <riff-IRC> ~2.5GB of build and source code files turns into about 12GB of random files during the build process, and the process spits out a roughly 40MB installer package.
[08:59:22] <riff-IRC> ~136MB installed, most configured installations had about 200MB used up by GC3.
[08:59:37] <csws> Virtual-Potato: neverpoll is infinitely scalable too
[08:59:50] <Virtual-Potato> indeed
[09:00:38] <riff-IRC> Some extreme configurations (8-way InterLine PSS + LPI TwinTrip III + LPI TwinStak II + LPI TriStak III remote config/control) bloated to almost 500MB with everything installed and configured.

[09:04:52] <riff-IRC> We had 3 UPSs running the build system. Ferrups FD 15kW x3 in parallel.
[09:06:49] <riff-IRC> During a parallel build of 2 versions of GC3, we'd drain the batteries on those UPSs in about 5 minutes flat. Dedicated 100A/208V ckt to the build racks,

[09:08:28] * riff-IRC nods
[09:09:51] <riff-IRC> Oh, and did I mention that each build system and its respective storage array required ~50A to be self-sufficient?
[09:10:12] <riff-IRC> 30A on the system and storage array, and 20A for the A/C system to cool it.
[09:11:34] <riff-IRC> It was one A/C system, but it pulled about 80-85A running at full head pressure on a hot day with a hot build room.

[09:15:17] <riff-IRC> Accounting for inverter losses and inefficiencies, we were pulling just under 170A from each UPS's 96V battery back

[09:15:24] <layer8> riff-IRC meant: "Accounting for inverter losses and inefficiencies, we were pulling just under 170A from each UPS's 96V battery bank."
[09:15:56] <JollyRgrs> that's a lot of bitcoin to be mining, son
[09:16:08] <riff-IRC> And may God have mercy on your soul if you forgot to switch off the printer on build night.
[09:16:28] <riff-IRC> Because when a build bombed, it BOMBED. HARD.
[09:17:31] <riff-IRC> 500 pages of stack trace spewed out. We piped it through a script that grep'd an error and a file/line number from the mess and spat it out on the console.
[09:18:45] <DrZak> :)
[09:18:49] <riff-IRC> It was even worse if it took down the OS with it, which it often did due to the fact that it ran as root because it needed the ability to acquire and release system resources VERY aggressively.
[09:21:17] <riff-IRC> When it finished building a module that didn't bring in a lot of libs (protected mode module, bus or filesystem driver) and started building a large module that dragged in a TON of libs (e.g. LPI Infrastructure Controller), RAM usage could go from 50MB to 92MB in a heartbeat and start spilling over onto the 2GB of swap that it has available to it.
[09:22:06] <riff-IRC> And it made EXTREME use of raw access to system hardware, too.
[09:24:03] <riff-IRC> So when a build bombed out, wrote totally invalid data into $important_memory, and inevitably crashed the OS, it tended to churn out about 3500 pages of stack trace.
[09:24:15] * gibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[09:24:31] <riff-IRC> If the printer was offline, nothing would be sent to it. But if it was online.....
[09:25:14] <riff-IRC> The buffer on the printer (and the parallel port) would fill up around the 1250 page mark, but that's still 1250 pages of paper queued up.
[09:26:14] <riff-IRC> And sometimes when we were chasing a rather nasty bug, we would actually save the raw data to a 700MB EDSI drive and have it run off on an industrial line printer.
[09:27:21] <e1> So now i have a GPO being applied to a machine
[09:27:24] <e1> and that GPO has been deleted

[09:28:31] <riff-IRC> odd
[09:29:35] <riff-IRC> And we'd comb thru the stack trace, determining what was loaded and what it was doing when it totally and utterly imploded on itself.
[09:30:35] <riff-IRC> 99% of the time, it read in totally invalid data that was immediately passed to something that's responsible for passing it thru the kernel or writing it to either GC3 memory or for writing to a processor register.
[09:31:17] <riff-IRC> GC3 memory written with bad data = GC3 module crash (and reload) at best, total GC3 crash at worst.
[09:31:45] <riff-IRC> Processor register written with bad data = 100% chance of OS crash and possibly a hard CPU lockup.

[10:00:49] <riff-IRC> Instead replaced by a few lines of code that permanently disabled the ISP PnP hardware and placed the bus into standard (non-PnP) mode.

[12:06:31] <CptLuxx> maybe they make it "good" till then
[12:06:38] <nobyk> Yeah, and enterprise etc will be 2029 iirc
[12:07:09] <kaligraphic> No, we'll be moving things from Control Panel and Settings into a new app, Options, so that you will have one more place to look for what Linux would just toss into /etc.
[12:07:31] <nobyk> It's going to be great
[12:07:45] <nobyk> It's a great idea to streamline how device settings work
[12:08:04] <nobyk> similar to a mobile phone, it makes sense for an end user to look for settings in the 'windows settings'
[12:08:08] <CptLuxx> maybe 2025 will be the year of linux on the desktop
[12:08:09] <CptLuxx> bwahahha

[12:08:31] <CptLuxx> no

[12:09:35] <crustacean> Its the same thing (among other enraging ones) that happened with UnifyOS, old GUI and new GUI do not hold the same functionality
[12:10:13] <crustacean> So you have to hop between them
[12:10:35] <kaligraphic> Yeah, if Settings actually had enough settings to work with, it wouldn't be nearly so annoying.
[12:11:29] <kaligraphic> On the plus side, it's a great incentive to learn to configure a Windows system with just Powershell. :)
[12:13:04] <crustacean> +1
[12:13:25] <crustacean> PowerShell is quite good
[12:13:37] <crustacean> And now with a package manager even better

[18:25:45] <nobyk> and it's very much a permission issue right? Not like a connection issue

[18:26:33] <nobyk> where a connection works to a fqdn but not the IP
[18:26:42] <nobyk> has to do with how winrm does auth I believe
[18:26:51] <nobyk> But that's not really helpful is it
[18:27:01] <PublicWiFi> thats what he's expericing
[18:27:15] <PublicWiFi> permissions dont work over IP/hostname, only FDQN

[22:20:34] <sd> 12<s​4rtr3> I have a Veeam B&R server that's getting overloaded with too many jobs. It's a VM and storage has been presented to it via vSphere and Fibre Channel.

[22:21:18] <A-KO> anyone building FC setups in 2021 is......well, need to be fired
[22:21:18] <Riviera> many people?
[22:21:25] <Riviera> why?
[22:22:13] <A-KO> uhm, because it's based on dated technology that hasn't kept pace? If you want to go faster now you build on RDMA/etc?
[22:22:24] <Riviera> bleh
[22:22:47] <A-KO> anyways. s4rtr3 ; you need something that can connect to the vcenter system as well wouldn't you? In order to perform snapshots to get consistent backups?
[22:23:39] <A-KO> so you'd probably just need a FC setup in the server as well as ethernet--but I'm almost positive (I could be wrong here?) that transfer would go through ESXI rather than direct to VMDK
[22:24:07] <A-KO> like you need something that can quiesce the file systems to do snapshots and then you backup the snapshots
[22:24:13] <A-KO> well, backup the previous disk anyway
[22:24:22] <sd> 12<s​4rtr3> I agree that it will be pulling from ESXi, but the target storage is hosted on a VMDK in a VM. And, I don't think I can access that
[22:24:32] <A-KO> yeah no
[22:24:49] <A-KO> all of that would go over a network layer like CIFS/NFS
[22:25:03] <sd> 12<s​4rtr3> Basically, I'm trying to determine if in my current infrastructure, whether I can pull this off or not.
[22:25:15] <A-KO> I mean, you *could* very likely ; but it probably wouldn't be pretty?
[22:25:22] *** Quits: sintax (~sintax@4.4.61.62) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[22:25:42] <A-KO> What about just adding an additional ESXI host and just moving the backup VM to that and pinning it there and giving it like all the resources?
[22:25:45] <sd> 12<s​4rtr3> haha yeah. So it seems like I can skip over the FC part and just use the network proxy transport. We've got 10gig between these servers
[22:26:48] <sd> 12<s​4rtr3> Yeah, the host that the VM is on right now has a lot of resources, but there's appetite in breaking it apart a bit. So, instead of a 64 GB VM, I could run with a smaller unit. Veeam is also recommending that given our infra's size, we break it apart as well.
[22:27:12] <A-KO> that still doesn't preclude you from just moving it to another host entirely but still part of the ESXI stack
[22:27:20] <A-KO> just prevent other machines from moving to that host
[22:27:27] <A-KO> and crank up the cpu cores on the OS on that system
[22:28:46] <Sousapro> Does it have to be FC? I've done a thing where I've got backup proxies on most of my hosts and iscsi (etc) direct connections to the backup target
[22:28:56] <Sousapro> Works well until literally too many IOPS
[22:30:02] <sd> 12<s​4rtr3> That part of the infra is built around FC. So, We have a few disk shelves connected to the FC switches.

[22:47:02] <aban> I’ve used Ansible on Linux, but not tried DSC. Thought it would be useful for maintaining Windows Updates on servers and desktops, but most of our servers one-offs and we have over 100
[22:47:16] <int0x1C8> meh, topic channels are usually puckered assholes
[22:47:43] <aban> Can’t think of any other uses for it though
[22:47:51] <iphone> yeah, but they're not really talking about python programming if you backscroll, so the noise isn't really interrupting anything 
[22:48:56] <int0x1C8> I know
[22:49:09] <iphone> but I also have a history of asking questions about my pet python in there so I might be more known
[22:49:18] <A-KO> aban: like any tool, it has its limitations. I like the design of DSC a little better than ansible when it comes to Windows, I feel it's a bit more flexible. I think most folks use ansible as-is, which works for I'm guessing 100% of linux use cases.
