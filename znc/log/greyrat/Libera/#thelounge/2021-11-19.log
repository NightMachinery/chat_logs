[02:30:59] <bookworm> the whole 3 line patch, took me *ages* :P
[02:33:21] <bookworm> johncs: the mentions window doesn't get created on demand, it gets mounted in the titlebar and stays there.... meaning the callback would never be removed at all, that's why I did it this way
[02:33:25] <bookworm> thanks for the review btw
[02:34:07] <johncs> hot reloading will destroy it at least ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, so may be a dev-server-only issue
[02:34:38] <bookworm> how does eventbus handle multiple off events?
[02:34:46] <bookworm> do you know by hard? Is this allowed?
[02:35:16] <johncs> if you just add the callback in the mount and remove it when destroyed, i think you'll be covered
[02:35:40] <johncs> i don't know offhand what events does if you tell it to remove a non-existent callback
[02:35:43] <bookworm> yeah, but then we have a nonsense thing that sets a false bool to false every time esc is pressed
[02:35:57] <johncs> i think that's very ok
[02:36:09] <bookworm> is it? you tell me, you are the frontend dev
[02:36:21] * bookworm doesn't have much experience in those manners
[02:36:25] <bookworm> matters*
[02:36:26] <johncs> yeah, that's an ok thing to do
[02:36:33] <bookworm> mkey, easy way then
[02:36:50] <johncs> i don't actually have much experience with vue, but it almost certainly checks to see if the value actually changes before doing any more work. so it won't cause any perf issues.
[02:37:38] <johncs> for those sorts of things you only need to worry if the event is triggering a lot. like on mouse move or scroll.

[11:02:10] <bookworm> that one is buggy on several levels and what is meant to happen is that someone fixes those
[11:02:37] <fnutt> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4191 seems to be done actually.
[11:03:05] <fnutt> It does what it says by Nachtalb.
[11:03:08] <bookworm> for example the indicator is still there on the hamburger icon if you are mentioned in a muted chan
[11:03:33] <fnutt> Rest of the comments are just... what can be done etc. etc. But the PR works.
[11:03:46] <fnutt> Fair point, bookworm. :)
[11:04:16] <fnutt> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4188 has been worked on a lot! What is left to do here?
[11:04:38] <bookworm> it's first and foremost a matter of figuring out what actually *should* be done...
[11:05:06] <bookworm> and you don't need to paste every PR now in here... it's feature freeze anyhow
[11:05:22] <bookworm> there will be a release after that one, don't worry
[11:05:35] <bookworm> but eventually we need to get out what we have now
[11:05:44] <bookworm> then we can start adding more features
[11:06:15] <fnutt> I don't worry. If I want a PR merged, I just do it locally.
[11:06:36] <fnutt> But I do fear that a lot of those pull requests will be closed and forgotten.
[11:07:59] <bookworm> they aren't closed
[11:08:10] <bookworm> I don't see a reason why they should be either
[11:09:22] <fnutt> There seems to be a trend to clean up the PR list prior to a new release.

[11:11:42] <fnutt> Brb
[11:11:52] <bookworm> and for some that makes perfect sense... there is at least one PR that duplicates the hide media preview one you just pasted
[11:12:01] <bookworm> you don't need to keep both eventually
