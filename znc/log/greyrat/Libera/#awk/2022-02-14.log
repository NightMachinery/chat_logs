[20:35:06] <emanuele6> ( there is no value of elapsed greater or equal to 30 in your example... )
[20:36:28] <lunaphyte> emanuele6: thanks, that seems to work well
[20:36:49] <lunaphyte> could i trouble you to break it down?  i'd like to understand how it works
[20:37:11] <lunaphyte> i know -F is setting the field separator, but the rest i don't know
[20:37:40] <lunaphyte> oh
[20:38:03] <lunaphyte> it's saying look at the next field after fs, and print the line if greater than 30?
[20:39:14] <emanuele6> -F= tells awk to separate fields by "="
[20:39:24] <emanuele6> NF is the number of fields in the current record
[20:39:38] <emanuele6> $NF gets the value of NF-th field, so the last field
[20:39:56] <emanuele6> $NF >= 30 is true if $NF is greater than or equal to 30
[20:40:04] <lunaphyte> ah
[20:40:24] <emanuele6> if $NF >= 30 is true, the record is printed, otherwise it is not printed
[20:40:53] <lunaphyte> so the key there is that elapsed= always has to be last then, right?
[20:41:04] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[20:41:43] <emanuele6> the word elapsed does not even matter, it just checks the value of the last field, so what is after the last =
[20:41:56] <lunaphyte> right, i get that
[20:42:20] <lunaphyte> ok, thanks
