[02:15:46] <zwegnerZachWegne> err nevermind that is not the full problem. even with ESC removed from tpf the libvterm paste mode is entered now, and a literal ESC byte is sent to the shell, rather than being interpreted as a control code by libvterm. i'm not yet seeing a way to manually send control codes to a terminal window

[09:46:16] <bluemonksr[m]>  * in vimscript functions/commands/aucmds, what does the `<bang>` attribute do? Whenever I look in help files for bang it says that expands to `!` but does not say what it is used for. 
[09:46:16] <bluemonksr[m]> I know in ex mode its to execute external commands or force a command like `w!` but what is its use in `function!`
[09:50:39] <ii14[m]> with functions and commands it overwrites the previous function/command, with autocmd it clears the autocommand(s)
[09:51:15] <ii14[m]> so without bang :function and :command will throw error if it's already defined
[09:51:36] <ii14[m]> unless it was defined in the same file
[09:52:32] <bluemonksr[m]> If I understand you correctly, it is used for redefinition? 
[09:52:37] <ii14[m]> and with autocmd you can do `augroup <group> | autocmd! | augroup end` to clear some autocmd group
[09:52:41] <ii14[m]> yes
[09:53:49] <ii14[m]> the boilerplate for autocommands is... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/5ea93948210333ae25ad80126f662792367de716)
[09:54:02] <ii14[m]> so when you source the file again, the old autocommands are cleared
[09:54:31] <bluemonksr[m]> aah so its about re-sourcing, not about executing multiple times!! of course that makes sense
[09:54:49] <ii14[m]> well, executing multiple times too
[09:55:50] <ii14[m]> because if you source a file with `:function` and `:command` again, it will just overwrite the old ones. but if you have two vim script files with that define functions or commands with the same names without bang, then you will have an error
[09:55:51] <bluemonksr[m]> ii14[m]: because I have defined user commands via `nvim_add_user_command` and have omitted the boolean flag. havent seen anything undesired
[09:56:20] <ii14[m]> not sure how it works with nvim api
[09:57:48] <bluemonksr[m]> ii14[m]: I see. that makes sense. Is this an edge case? I mean does defining the same function/command in multiple files (unless by different plugins) occur?
[09:57:57] <ii14[m]> I'm pretty sure with nvim_exec/vim.cmd redefining command/function will throw an error, because it uses a new script context every time, but maybe nvim_add_user_command handles that differently
[09:59:24] <ii14[m]> bluemonksr[m]: you can always leave it out and it will throw an error, that's precisely what it is for :)
[09:59:58] <bluemonksr[m]> ii14[m]: `add_user_command` has a bang boolean in its options, so I imagine it functions the same way as the vimscript counterpart
[10:00:17] <ii14[m]> test it out though and try running the same nvim_add_user_command call twice and see what happens

[10:04:14] <bluemonksr[m]> just did. nothing printed in the cmd line area. Tried both, identical redefinition and changing its contents. 
[10:07:08] <ii14[m]> okay, then you probably don't have to care about it
[10:15:36] <arch_angel> hmmmm, why are coc.nvim completions so weird
[10:15:58] <arch_angel> like if I select a completion for example "int main()"
[10:16:06] <arch_angel> it only adds "int"
[10:16:14] <arch_angel> the " main()" is omitted
[10:16:36] <arch_angel> and I've observed this behaviour for the characters "(" too
[10:17:02] <arch_angel> so like when there's this completion option "something()" and I select that option I only get "something" without the "()"

[16:54:06] <lalitmeeLalitKum> How to make `require` work in a lua `plugin` or `colorscheme` while creating? Because that folder is still not in our `nvim` config. I am new to this.
[16:57:38] <ii14[m]> `require` is looks up files in the `lua/` directory
[16:57:54] <ii14[m]> if you put a lua file in plugin it will be evaluated unconditionally
[16:57:59] <aniketgm> lalitmeeLalitKum: what do you mean make it work ? can you share
[16:58:04] <aniketgm> your config
[16:58:12] <ii14[m]> and in colorscheme directory it will be evaluated on :colorscheme command
[16:58:14] *** Quits: jangho (~jangho@121.165.8.28) (Quit: znc)
[16:59:12] <lalitmeeLalitKum> Actually I had to do this `set rtp+=.`. I think I was not able to explain myself. I was asking to let nvim know about my plugin which I am creating in my local.
[16:59:47] <ii14[m]> yes, the containing directory has to be in runtimepath
[17:00:47] <ii14[m]> not plugin, colors or lua directory, but the parent directory
[17:01:40] <dundargoc> Hubi61: on the off chance that you're not a bot and just *very* bored (unlikely as it may be), please stop constantly changing your name. It's annoying.
[17:01:44] <dundargoc> That's it buddy
[17:01:51] <dundargoc> Now you crossed the line.
[17:02:06] <aniketgm> best way I think is to put all you lua config in lua folder. and a simple -- require "plugins" should work. since nvim with a init.lua config looks for lua/<your_config_files>.lua

[17:03:34] <clason[m]> Sorry, but ii14 is correct here -- `plugin` (or whatever) for scripts (.vim or .lua, makes not difference); `lua` for Lua modules (not scripts). You should choose according to what you need.
