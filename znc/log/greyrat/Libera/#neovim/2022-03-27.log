[20:25:06] <vaaqif> Hi guys. I have changed my alacritty opacity to 0.8 and I want vim to reflect the changes and be translucent also. I current use the onedark colorscheme and I saw in the readme of this https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim there is a function whcihh you can put into your vimrc to ignore the background color in termninal but I can't get it to work. I use an init.lua and I tried putting it inside a
[20:25:08] <vaaqif> vim.cmd but it doesn't seem to work.
[20:25:42] <vaaqif> Would anyone be able to help me? I just want nvim to be translucent like my alacritty
[20:26:40] <ii14[m]> you need to do it before you set the colorscheme

I current use the onedark colorscheme and I saw in the readme of this https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim there is a function whcihh you can put into your vimrc to ignore the background color in termninal but I can't get it to work. I use an init.lua and I tried putting it inside a
[20:41:39] <vaaqif> vim.cmd but it doesn't seem to work.
[20:41:43] <vaaqif> Would anyone be able to help me? I just want nvim to be translucent like my alacritty

[23:21:14] <mjlbach[m]> ishan: The most popular completion framework is nvim-cmp, which came out around June of last year
[23:21:57] <mjlbach[m]> > now, inlay hints work but it doesn't auto complete functions in imported libraries 
[23:21:57] <mjlbach[m]> That's likely an issue with the language server/project settings, there's nothing that would have changed in neovim
[23:22:09] <ishan> mjlbach[m]: Yes, checking that now. coq_nvim is acting up a lot. Do I have to write all of my config in `cmp.setup`? 
[23:22:26] <mjlbach[m]> wdym
[23:22:26] <ishan> mjlbach[m]: It works fine _after_ I save the file once. 
[23:22:38] <mjlbach[m]> What works?
[23:22:41] <mjlbach[m]> The imports?
[23:23:27] *** Quits: justOkay (~justache@user/justache) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:23:31] <ishan> mjlbach[m]: In nvim-cmp's github readme, they have the mapping in the lua config. https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp. Do I need to do that too? (currently the mapping is in vimscript) 
[23:23:40] <ishan> mjlbach[m]: inlayHints work after I save the file once. 
[23:24:22] <mjlbach[m]> Is this rust-analyzer?
[23:24:25] <ishan> Yes
[23:24:26] *** Joins: justOkay (~justache@user/justache)
[23:24:58] <mjlbach[m]> I'm not 100% sure but rust-analyzer only runs some diagnostics (cargo check) on save, so it may apply to generating the type hints as well (which is what populates the inlay hints)
[23:25:25] <mjlbach[m]> ishan: Well the mapping is optional
[23:25:54] <mjlbach[m]> But gradually yes, more and more plugins are "lua first" so you would have to translate the lua into vimscript calls into lua functions, which... not worth it
[23:26:01] <mjlbach[m]> just put it in a heredoc if you really want to use vimscript
[23:26:07] <ishan> mjlbach[m]: That behaviour is  configurable. I was using autocmd for this and it's supposed to run on, `CursorMoved,BufEnter,BufWinEnter,TabEnter,InsertLeave` events but I was also getting errors when using the `CursorMoved,BufEnter,BufWinWnter` events.

[23:26:32] <mjlbach[m]> ishan: I don't know which behavior you are talking about
[23:26:59] <mjlbach[m]> Populating the inlay hints with rust-tools.nvim?
[23:27:23] <ishan> I am not using rust-tools.nvim. I was using completion-nvim. 
[23:27:33] <ishan> Let's just forget about this. I'll try out nvim-cmp

[23:29:49] <mjlbach[m]> I thought you were talking about inlay hints, which are not provided by completion.nvim
[23:30:39] <mjlbach[m]> > now, inlay hints work but it doesn't auto complete functions in imported libraries 
[23:30:39] <mjlbach[m]> That wouldn't be provided via neovim since it just got added into the 3.17 spec and I'm waiting for server implementations to catch up

[23:34:51] <mjlbach[m]> And also probably best to wait for anticonceal before anyone works on it lest you want to do it twice
[23:41:50] <ishan> Okay, that makes sense
[23:42:35] <ishan> anywayy, already see some issues in nvim-cmp... show_line_diagnostics is not yet supported https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim/issues/24 Doesn't support specifying the path to ra_lsp binary so need to add that in the $PATH 
[23:43:20] <p00f> ishan: change server.cmd
[23:43:47] <ishan> Ah thank you p00f 
[23:44:35] <ishan> Here it passes the `server` block to `setup`. In my current config, `cmd` was specified outside of the `server` block so I didn't think this would work https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim/blob/9f89fe6d9762ef89973bbb698c750dd21b94ec44/lua/rust-tools.lua#L148

[23:49:57] <mjlbach[m]> `:lua vim.diagnostic.open_float()`  uses the new diagnostic api, which is the replacement for `vim.lsp.show_line_diagnostics()`

[23:50:58] <mjlbach[m]> I think it will look fine, most people want the type hint by the actual variable name based off of the requests
[23:51:03] <mjlbach[m]> Even without mixed pitch fonts
[23:51:05] <p00f> too big, the actual code will get shifted way too much to the right

[23:51:31] <mjlbach[m]> I mean that's what vscode does
[23:51:50] <p00f> doesn't it use a smaller font there? clion does
[23:53:23] <mjlbach[m]> it's only like one or two sizes down though
[23:53:31] <mjlbach[m]> I think they do that mostly for aesthetics
[23:54:18] <mjlbach[m]> idk someone can pretty easily do a mock-up by setting extmarks manually on 'real' text (not virtual text) to compare how it will look
[23:57:55] <p00f> something like gui=Thin would be nice, but terminals can't be asked to do that right?
