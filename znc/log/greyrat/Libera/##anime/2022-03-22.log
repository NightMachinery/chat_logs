[01:07:09] <emmeka> MootPoot suit yourself, it's a joke then. I'm not criticizing you, fwiw. I understand perfectly well why you'd have a mindset like that. It is, in the end, the way our society has told boys to view themselves and conduct themselves.
[01:07:44] <Zoidberg> not many could tolerate the office MootPoot 
[01:08:09] <MootPoot> At best I could agree with this partially - "view all that as a way of seeking validation and gratification." but I'd like to know what exactly you think is a non-toxic mindset for this emmeka 
[01:08:48] <MootPoot> personally if we're not joking anymore I'd stick on "mutual" to that phrase

[01:15:57] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: ^^
[01:16:00] <emmeka> MootPoot I'd start by saying that you shouldn't view yourself as less valid of a man, or less successful as a man, because you haven't "achieved" being with a woman. It's not a badge you get to validate yourself. It's a relationship with another human being, it is only important insofar as it is a part of your relationship with that /person/
[01:16:50] <Zoidberg> totally!!
[01:17:44] <Zoidberg> it's this living in society thing that builds up walls and makes us think what's normal and what isn't..
[01:17:54] <Zoidberg> same for how to live and what to do
[01:18:03] <MootPoot> eh - If I cared about that I could have just paid for a sex worker - I've had literal 100s of chances to do it. I'm not really hung up on that part
[01:18:38] <Zoidberg> that's not the same, isn't it?
[01:18:50] <MootPoot> seems like the same thing
[01:18:54] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: I think that you'll feel better about everything once you're back to work, and able to do all those other things in life that compliment dating
[01:19:27] <MootPoot> I guess I could see it if you have some kind of sense of "victory" from talking a woman into sex then doing it 
[01:19:31] <MootPoot> I know some people like that
[01:19:34] <MootPoot> but that's not me either
[01:19:59] <emmeka> MootPoot I don't mean just "getting laid" but also the way you view relationships, as if it is something you get, that you obtain, and that achieving that is what's most important.
[01:20:09] <emmeka> I'm not sure I'm putting this right...
[01:20:20] <MootPoot> ah
[01:20:23] <Zoidberg> I don't know either. I'm a virgin but from what I understand it's the emotional intimacy that makes sex great.
[01:20:28] <MootPoot> well, that's fine - but
[01:20:43] <MootPoot> I think I get your point
[01:20:58] <Zoidberg> it's not just about being good looking

[01:48:37] <Bco1981> yeah metoo
[01:48:37] <MootPoot> after all, you still hang out on IRC for a reason Zoidberg 
[01:48:43] <Fenderbassist> :D
[01:49:03] <MootPoot> there are certain human needs which dont really pass for 99.99% of people
[01:49:17] <Bco1981> ME wasn't worth the upgrade. 
[01:49:24] <Fenderbassist> totally not
[01:49:26] <MootPoot> eating, sleep, socializing ( you can go without , but your QOL will go down massively )
[01:49:27] <Fenderbassist> I never bothered with it
[01:49:45] <Bco1981> i tried it, but reverted.
[01:49:46] <Fenderbassist> heard too many problems
[01:49:50] <Fenderbassist> oh really
[01:49:53] <Fenderbassist> was it truly horrible?
[01:49:57] <Zoidberg> yeah MootPoot, I quit in middle but got a call from amigojapan, so came back again
[01:49:57] <Bco1981> ghost backup
[01:50:16] <Zoidberg> irc is good for socializing
[01:50:26] <Bco1981> Fenderbassist: i remember things like sound would stutter when you barely used the pc.
[01:50:44] <Fenderbassist> hmmm
[01:51:12] <Fenderbassist> so was running the sound over the PCI bus, which back then was a challenge
[01:51:27] <Fenderbassist> if the OS was wonky, that would be even more of a problem
[01:51:32] <Bco1981> yeah i think my card was still isa

[01:52:18] <Fenderbassist> aye
[01:52:25] <Fenderbassist> never been quite the same way again
[01:52:51] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: seriously though, being single isn't bad, more time for yourself and more savings but there are also things that we miss on, sometimes lonely but nothing is permanent 
[01:52:56] <Fenderbassist> makes me watch retro computer channels once in a while
[01:53:04] <Zoidberg> it's the same for marriage and relationships
[01:53:06] <Bco1981> same :D
[01:53:16] <MootPoot> Zoidberg: the thing is - I've done most of the things I wanted to
[01:53:23] <MootPoot> everything else is a slow grind
[01:53:33] <Zoidberg> find new things, explore new things
[01:53:51] <emmeka> that's all adulthood is, really. a slow grind.
[01:54:17] <Zoidberg> this is our only life man, don't tell me you've done everything you wanted to and you're not even 30 MootPoot 
[01:54:17] <JesseDesu> light roast is best
[01:54:25] <MootPoot> now I'm just looking at the rest of my life being nothing but eat work sleep 
[01:54:34] <emmeka> such is the way of things

[01:55:44] <Fenderbassist> nice
[01:55:54] <MootPoot> although I'm not the "relationship means you must do everything with the other person and function like conjoined twins" person either

[01:56:18] <MootPoot> I'll just do my own stuff
[01:56:23] <Bco1981> i have a dx4-120 in the original board, and upgraded the L2 cache froma 128kb to 256kb

[01:58:49] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: joking
[01:58:52] <MootPoot> there might be some really nice girls there but it would literally just be a lootbox
[01:59:01] <MootPoot> where you dont know if you'll click or not
[02:00:04] <Zoidberg> it's not completely like that, we get to chat but not much time and not many dates
[02:00:12] <MootPoot> anyway for now I'll just watch emmeka weebify his wife
[02:00:16] <MootPoot> keep at it emmeka  - ganbare
[02:00:24] <Zoidberg> it's like speed dating but you've to marry afterwards
[02:00:44] <MootPoot> yeah I have some asian friends who did that
[02:00:53] <Zoidberg> at most you can chat like for an 30min to an hour face to face
[02:01:10] <Zoidberg> and maybe meet afterwards,I don't know
[02:01:15] <MootPoot> but it takes more then just a few meetings to really know somebody - afterwards you are just relying on social pressure and chance that you two mingle for it to work
[02:01:54] <Zoidberg> emmeka's wife has been watching anime for years if I remember correctly
[02:01:56] <JesseDesu> !seen satin
[02:01:57] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: satin was last seen in ##anime 7 hours and 6 minutes ago: <Satin> xD
[02:02:06] <MootPoot> he's slowly increasing her dose
[02:02:26] <Zoidberg> exactly, that's why I hate that system

[02:08:42] <Zoidberg> reading and watching a tv show or a movie isn't the same
[02:08:56] <MootPoot> I mean, fiction is fiction - its literally fake

[02:10:19] <Zoidberg> oh god, you remind me of myself
[02:10:23] <MootPoot> and that was a LONG time ago
[02:11:30] <MootPoot> I know there is some really good fiction out there, I'm not dismissing it - I just have a limited amount of mental power
[02:11:39] <MootPoot> and right now its better spent learning computer stuff
[02:11:54] <MootPoot> I can do that when I dont have to worry about my paycheck
[02:13:08] <Zoidberg> faitu!
[02:16:13] <teus> i started reading a brief history of time

[02:17:15] <teus> but i got lost in some sequel when it got repetitive and boring
[02:17:32] <MootPoot> but those aren't really particuarly complex books

[06:11:50] <Fenderbassist> Xanax and alcohol depress the central nervous system (CNS). They both have individual sets of side effects that affect a person’s behavior and mental state.
[06:11:52] <Fenderbassist> When Xanax and alcohol combine, the effects can be dangerous.
[06:12:03] <Satin> hmmm i see
[06:12:05] <Satin> well
[06:12:10] <Satin> i had half a can of hard seltzer earlier
[06:12:15] <Fenderbassist> I don't think it's a good practice in general
[06:12:16] <Satin> and am taking xanax for the first time now
[06:12:20] <Satin> but i won't drink the rest of the can now
[06:12:28] <Fenderbassist> I don't think half a can will matter after an hour

[06:12:32] <Satin> ah

[06:12:37] <Satin> yeah
[06:12:45] <Satin> and only 5% 
[06:12:48] <Fenderbassist> booze in general is not good to mix with pharmas
[06:12:49] <Satin> alc/vol
[06:12:50] <Satin> yea
[06:13:00] <Satin> i rarely if ever drink
[06:13:05] <Satin> and when i do it's hard seltzers lol
[06:13:05] <Fenderbassist> ex benadryl / diphenhydramine......can be dangerous enough to stop your breathing
[06:13:10] <Satin> ya i see
[06:13:11] <Fenderbassist> if you mix it with booze
[06:13:15] <Satin> glad i checked
[06:13:19] <Fenderbassist> that's a big no no 
[06:13:28] <Satin> wasn't expecting there to be something but i guess there is a bad interaction here to avoid
[06:13:37] <Fenderbassist> when taking pharmas, you want plenty of water

[06:13:44] <Fenderbassist> imho
[06:14:21] <Satin> ye gotcha

[06:17:26] <Satin> ah 
[06:17:43] <Satin> yeah, i'm not interested in going down any rabbit hole here
[06:17:57] <Satin> my PTSD anxiety is paralyzing me and impairing my life currently including schoolwork
[06:18:24] <Satin> i don't trust my family doctor entirely to know what he's doing - he prescribed me lithium previously when it's not really something people take, according to multiple therapists i talked to
[06:18:33] <Satin> but nonetheless this seems like a common sense and alright solution for now
[06:19:04] <Satin> i'll consult to be sure with the therapist i'm newly working with on the 23rd just to be extra sure this isn't a weird out of context medication
[06:19:08] <Satin> I do need medication for sure though
[06:19:12] <Satin> ust not sure what
[06:19:25] <Fenderbassist> just be careful with benzos
[06:19:32] <Fenderbassist> it's easy to keep taking them and needing more and more
[06:19:57] <Fenderbassist> and then your brain stops making some chemicals (I think?) after a while cause you're ingesting it 
[06:20:07] <Satin> yeah for sure
[06:20:11] <Fenderbassist> they are only good very short term
[06:20:13] <Fenderbassist> imho
[06:20:20] <Fenderbassist> a very temporary crisis
[06:20:31] <Satin> i haven't had any sort of medication really besides the lithium orate he prescribed me which i didn't take 
[06:20:33] <Fenderbassist> to get your bearings and then make those changes that enable you to continue
[06:20:34] <Satin> really*
[06:20:36] <Satin> yeah
[06:20:47] <Satin> no medication practically since the shooting and i'm not doing that great so
[06:20:49] <Fenderbassist> gotcha, I had Lithium in the early 90s from a doc once
[06:20:55] <Fenderbassist> I understand
[06:21:09] <Fenderbassist> most of my friends in your situation , and where it's legal, use cannabis
[06:21:11] <Fenderbassist> for such
[06:21:16] <Satin> interesting
[06:21:29] <Fenderbassist> way better for PTSD than pharmas in their voiced opinons
[06:21:34] <Fenderbassist> opinions, even
[06:21:38] <Satin> i see
[06:21:42] <Fenderbassist> but not worth going an illegal route to do so
[06:21:52] <Satin> it's legal in new mexico i believe
[06:21:55] <Fenderbassist> cool
[06:21:56] <Satin> but it's not widespread from waht i can tell
[06:22:01] <Satin> because of how new it is
[06:22:04] <Satin> newly legalized**
[06:22:12] <Fenderbassist> was legalized here in 2020 I think
[06:22:17] <Fenderbassist> it's booming
[06:22:23] <Fenderbassist> all over the place
[06:22:32] <Fenderbassist> we even have CBD coffee shops opening up
[06:22:38] <Satin> was legalized summer 2021 here
[06:22:44] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[06:22:46] <Satin> i see
[06:23:40] <Fenderbassist> anyway, that's what a bunch of personal friends have told me, so take it for what it's worth
[06:24:58] <Satin> it's consistent with what i hear from my friends as well

[14:14:53] <DunceCotus> right
[14:15:01] <DunceCotus> its definitely not lol random 'weird'
[14:15:42] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeah some pieces of the puzzle in NGE don't fit. I think the original ending, and 3.0+1.0's ending are both... stupidly weird. I understand that the first one was due to budget, 
[14:16:05] <DunceCotus> yeeeah
[14:16:48] <DunceCotus> 3.0+1.0 just feels a bit rushed, they introduce all these new concepts

[14:17:10] <Kill-Animals> the second one though... I just watched most of the new nge after revisting the original series. I can't say that I find the weird ships made out of angel parts is ... And using these boats as shields? 
[14:17:42] <DunceCotus> bigger is not always better
[14:17:49] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeahhhhh there was the fourth wall. And they were trying to integrate it into the show which is... Its not appreciated to be quite honest.
[14:18:23] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: and too much bad CGI in 3.0+1.0

[14:19:44] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[14:19:58] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: CGI I can normally forgive
[14:20:04] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeah thats for sure. Though they do some things better with scale. The bullets hitting the road for example.
[14:20:20] <DunceCotus> yeah 
[14:20:43] <DunceCotus> or that scene in one episode where the eva falls over onto a mountain
[14:20:51] <DunceCotus> and nearly crushes Toji
[14:20:52] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: I just view CGI as a, "Well if you are going to complain, then what you are asking for instead is no anime at all, because the budget won't permit it."
[14:21:20] <DunceCotus> well we can complain about how the CGI is used
[14:21:35] <DunceCotus> if they are required to use CGI they could at least think about how to use it good
[14:22:43] <DunceCotus> and yeah budgets seem really tight for a lot of animation these days, might be due to animators actually starting to get paid
[14:22:57] <Kill-Animals> I tend to give extra points of a 3D anime, for its direction. Some things are of course just ... 
[14:23:45] *** Quits: treeman6 (~treeman5@user/treeman5) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:24:12] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I suppose another factor is they had like 10 years to make Eva 3.0+1.0
[14:24:22] <DunceCotus> and most of the production happened in the last 2
[14:24:34] <Kill-Animals> Like the bad 3D scenes in Ghost in the Shell, the new netflix one, just really stick with me. For some reason though, I can't say the same thing about Berserk. I think its because Berserk focussed so well on backgrounds.

[14:25:46] <DunceCotus> the original GitS used 3D well, Innocence slightly less so but mostly inoffensive
[14:26:00] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Did you finish the first season? I will watch the second season, I enjoyed it enough. 
[14:26:15] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I think I watched the first two episodes and gave up
[14:26:22] <Kill-Animals> 1995 ghost in the shell used 3D?
[14:27:07] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: yeah I think so.. they had like holograms
[14:27:08] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: holographic GPS
[14:27:10] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: I watched it dubbed. I prefer the Ghost in the Shell dub; always have. Its a rare example of a superior dub over sub
[14:27:35] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: ah
[14:27:36] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: tsk. I got to watch the original 95. What a crime I havn't.
[14:27:55] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I prefer dubbed Steins;Gate over subbed
[14:27:58] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: yeah you really do
[14:28:18] <Kill-Animals> When I get around to steins gate, I'll consider the dub then.
[14:28:39] <DunceCotus> its just the main voice actor guy mostly
[14:28:44] <DunceCotus> perfect voice for that character
[14:28:46] <Kill-Animals> Also Dragonball Z, lmao. I know some people crucify people over that, but I can't stand goku's woman voice.
[14:29:08] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Cowboy Bebop is another one.

[14:31:42] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Wdym? 
[14:32:04] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: they can get a lot of anime for cheap and make mega profits from streaming it
[14:32:19] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I mean like Netflix
[14:32:21] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Ah. Well I only know of netflix and youtube.
[14:32:23] <DunceCotus> though they also do original animes
[14:32:43] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Violet Evergarden, a "Netflix anime", looks extremely expensive.

[14:32:48] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: point is its cheaper to acquire these animes than a lot of tv shows/movies I think
[14:32:51] <Kill-Animals> Its also quite good from what Ive seen.
[14:33:23] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I haven't heard of it
[14:33:59] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: You'd have to give examples. From what I have seen, there is a lot of hit and miss with netflix. Castlevania was just awful ( Or at least what I saw of it. )
[14:34:50] <Kill-Animals> But I think Netflix sponsored the second season of High Score Girl -- 
[14:34:53] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I mean like syndication
[14:34:57] <DunceCotus> not original series
[14:35:10] <DunceCotus> acquiring legacy anime series already aired
[14:35:24] <Kill-Animals> does syndication mean they funde- ah okay. Acquiring old properties.
[14:35:25] <DunceCotus> they can fill the platform with these series cause they're relatively inexpensive to acquire

[14:37:44] <DunceCotus> I haven't seen many
[14:38:14] <Kill-Animals> Because mine bar none, is "Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai"
[14:38:45] <Kill-Animals> "Kotobuki: The Wasteland Squadron" -- The final episodes are so incredibly fun.
[14:38:51] <Kill-Animals> I hope it gets a second season. 
[14:38:51] <DunceCotus> ok
[14:39:31] <Kill-Animals> But its a perfect example of how 3D can enhance an anime rather than be a budget sacrifice. 
[14:39:46] <DunceCotus> nice

[14:41:14] <Kill-Animals> I think its got to be one of the cheapest anime I have ever seen in my entire life, and yet its truly a great anime. 
[14:41:49] <DunceCotus> last anime that uses 3D well that I saw and liked was Deca-Dence
[14:41:58] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: One of the characters doesnt even have a voice actress! And its all done in 3D, while borrowing a lot of video game footage.
[14:42:24] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Ah deca-dence. See thats a good weird anime. 
[14:42:26] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: hmm ok
[14:43:30] <Kill-Animals> I don't remember much 3D in Deca-Dence. if anything, I remember it for its amazing 2D animation.
[14:44:17] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: its very subtle with its usage I think
[14:44:26] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: the Deca-Dence itself is 3D iirc
[14:44:56] <DunceCotus> and sometimes in battle sequences
[14:45:16] <Kill-Animals> thats what I thought. 
[14:45:33] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Did you like flcl? Fooly Cooly?
[14:45:46] <DunceCotus> haven't seen
[14:46:07] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: oh crazy. Same guy who made NGE, made FLCL. 
[14:46:43] <DunceCotus> also made a kickass newish Godzilla movie
[14:46:47] <Kill-Animals> Its so weird. Like incredibly weird. I guess its kind of memorable.

[14:55:24] <Kill-Animals> lol
[14:55:38] <Kill-Animals> like, Mothra doesnt show up as an angel. 
[14:55:39] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I think in terms of giant creatures/robots
[14:55:50] <DunceCotus> I mean Godzilla is part of a whole genre Anno is inspired by
[14:55:51] <Kill-Animals> pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
[14:56:08] <DunceCotus> does it matter?
[14:56:19] <DunceCotus> Eva took it to new heights (pardon pun)
[14:56:38] <Kill-Animals> Giant robots and creatures are too prolific.
[14:56:43] <Kill-Animals> hehehe
[14:57:00] <DunceCotus> pervasive?
[14:57:08] <Kill-Animals> You might as well be saying, "Attack on Titan" was inspired by godzilla.
[14:57:34] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: well in the sense of massive creatures/robots in a city setting (specifically Tokyo)
[14:57:43] <Kill-Animals> Or transformers: Robots in Disguise.
[14:58:23] <DunceCotus> I mean I think a lot of anime is inspired by Godzilla 
[14:58:26] <Kill-Animals> I think the only anime that I can think of that is inspired by godzilla would be Gridman.
[14:58:51] <DunceCotus> there's a term for it, I forgot what
[14:59:00] <DunceCotus> where things not normally big are blown up to city-scale proportions

[15:00:55] <Kill-Animals> one of the best villians in an anime, and thats coming froma  guy  who thinks there are hardly any good villians in any anime ever. 
[15:01:19] <DunceCotus> massive aliens, robots, monsters, people etc. = tokusatsu
[15:01:39] <DunceCotus> inspired a lot of anime masters
[15:02:03] <DunceCotus> this stuff was a staple in Japanese imaginary
[15:02:08] <DunceCotus> still is I guess
[15:02:39] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Its part of human myth writ large I would argue. Going back to goliath, and even before that.
[15:02:43] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: ok
[15:03:07] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: to an extent
[15:03:09] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Although maybe its different in Japanese. I would wonder if Japanese have any giants in their myths.

[15:03:43] <DunceCotus> giants used to roam the [Old] world
[15:04:16] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: I know Attack on Client is tapping into something different than just a "giant creature" fetish. There is something about Giant Humans which strikes a subconscious fear instinct in people.

[15:37:20] <amigojapan> I love female warriors like in Sailor Moon
[15:37:28] <Kill-Animals> nge doesnt count ( exactly ) becauge rei and asuka are fighting in mechas, so their fragile girlish frames are preserved. Attack on Titan has chicks swinging around like spiderman.
[15:37:35] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: yeah that's my main problem with it.. the fighting
[15:37:58] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Mooon magic != Female Warrior.

[15:39:36] <DunceCotus> Sxem: robo-them
[15:39:44] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: the english dub messed up calling them warriors and changed thet to "scouts"
[15:39:45] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: pish posh. It just isn't good storytelling anymore. Back when Super Metroid came out, it was kind of a novelty that samus ended up being a girl, but its been played out to exhaustion
[15:40:33] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: it also empowers women
[15:40:58] <Kill-Animals> I want to see an anime where a woman gains power and influence specifically by exploiting her feminine attributes and inclinations.. Not by doing karate in high heels. 
[15:41:32] <amigojapan> that probably exists in some form
[15:42:01] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I disagree about it empowering women, because it changes the definition of what a woman is to something akin to a man.
[15:42:19] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: what I am sick, and makes me nausious looking at is muscular men
[15:42:36] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I agree with you on this matter
[15:43:00] <DunceCotus> not sure why the obsession with "strong female characters" which are just women with stereotypically manly characteristics
[15:43:01] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Have you seen gridman?
[15:43:02] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: it shows that women can acomplish stuff like men or better to girls with pure minds
[15:43:25] <amigojapan> no Kill-Animals
[15:43:38] <amigojapan> !a gridman
[15:43:38] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: SSSS.Gridman (TV Series, 12 episodes) | Finished airing | http://anidb.net/a13260 | http://myanimelist.net/anime/35847 (2 more)
[15:44:09] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: But that isn't true, and so it does not translate into good story telling. It used to be a novelty, but that novelty has turned into the standard, that it is now more novel for an anime to have a man beating up a woman.
[15:44:51] <ezekielnoob> Kill-Animals interesting, im trying to think if there had been examples of that so far tho
[15:45:11] <DunceCotus> Beating up and not beating over
[15:45:28] <ezekielnoob> i reemmber a joe rogan pobcast discussing how beautiful looking women kinda has power over average men
[15:45:33] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Anyways in gridman, the main antagonist is a woman, and she is absolutely one of the best villians in any anime, specifically because all her villianous acts eminate from a feminine evil.
[15:46:21] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: all the vilains in Sailor moon are also evil, well, there is one male one, now that I remember
[15:46:49] <amigojapan> err
[15:46:53] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Queen Beryl is also kind of interesting, but I havnt watched it enough to give a good analysis.
[15:47:00] <amigojapan>  all of hte viilains in Sailor moon are also female*
[15:47:16] <amigojapan> ok Kill-Animals
[15:47:30] <DunceCotus> Maler Soon
[15:47:32] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: if you do watch it, be ready to watch a 200 episode show
[15:48:02] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Well I did watch almost all of Fist of the North Star.
[15:48:05] <DunceCotus> any anime with 200 episodes is 90% filler
[15:48:15] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I hate that
[15:48:32] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: You didnt like Fist of the North Star?
[15:48:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but it is useful filler in the case of Sailolr moon, and mostly comedy stuff
[15:49:01] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: no way,I told you I hate muscular men
[15:49:14] <amigojapan> its yuccky
[15:49:28] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Are you muscular?
[15:49:33] <amigojapan> no
[15:49:37] <amigojapan> same with JoJo
[15:49:42] <amigojapan> yuck
[15:49:46] <amigojapan> creepy
[15:49:47] <Kill-Animals> If you became muscular, do you think that would change?
[15:50:03] <amigojapan> no, I would think I am creepy
[15:50:21] <amigojapan> and gay
[15:50:22] <Kill-Animals> Being a strong man?
[15:50:36] <amigojapan> its gay to want to look at muscular menb
[15:50:37] <Kill-Animals> Well we don't want to be that, lol
[15:50:38] <bxgelsan> amigojapan, theres no shame in being gay
[15:50:56] <amigojapan> its heterosexual to want to look at nie women

[15:53:46] <ezekielnoob> i've been wondering if a heater/cooler shower would be nice
[15:53:58] <ezekielnoob> i should just get one, but i think there are electrical requirements
[15:54:06] <Kill-Animals> Anyways I was going to ask, amigojapan, do you believe it is a virtue, to be dangerous, or to be harmless?
[15:54:31] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals:why would that be a virtue?
[15:54:55] <amigojapan> that is calling black white and white black
[15:55:00] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Which? Dangerous or Harmless?
[15:55:20] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals:I am a pacifist so I go with harmless
[15:55:21] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, he thinks one word is white and one word is black, tldr
[15:55:25] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Some might reason that being harmless, means that one would not wage war.
[15:55:36] <amigojapan> correct
[15:55:44] <amigojapan> war sucks
[15:56:23] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: For being dangerous, trying to extract a virtue is more difficult, given the overtone. But, one could reason, that 
[15:56:23] <bxgelsan> conflict is always inevitable. its unfortunate.

[15:57:07] <Kill-Animals> "If one is not capable of cruelty, then he will absolutely be a victim to those who are" -- Ergo, it is a virtue to be dangerous.
[15:57:41] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I have never gotten into a fist fight

[15:59:51] <bxgelsan> i saw a word and started typing.
[16:00:17] <Kill-Animals> ego is something you put in a toaster. Ergo means "Therefore".

[16:00:22] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: darkwitch was last seen in ##anime 21 hours and 8 minutes ago: <darkwitch> Jain is that odd university in bang a lore
[16:00:23] <bxgelsan> i know
[16:00:27] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, cognition.
[16:00:29] <bxgelsan> issue
[16:00:29] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: problem with gay?
[16:00:53] <amigojapan> cogito ergo sum
[16:00:55] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Moral or hypothetical?
[16:01:41] <ezekielnoob> i think it's a god thing
[16:02:07] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I dunno
[16:02:15] <DunceCotus> what's the moral issue?
[16:02:17] <amigojapan> I am just saying I am not gay, I am ok with other people being gay
[16:02:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: people are gay whether you are okay with it or not
[16:02:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it feels like they would rather me be ok with it tho
[16:03:31] <ezekielnoob> i think the only thing that won't make it okay is that if there's a god that will actually send fire through the skies if some guy sucks another guys dick
[16:03:33] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Morals are determined by God. He calls it an abombination, and because he thinks its a problem, someone who recognizes God simply has to as well, whether he agrees or doesnt.
[16:03:42] <bxgelsan> closeted feelings due to shame
[16:03:44] <bxgelsan> heh
[16:03:46] <ezekielnoob> yeah it's a god thing
[16:03:48] <bxgelsan> sucks
[16:03:49] <bxgelsan> :)
[16:03:58] <ezekielnoob> there's not really a good explanation to not be okay with it
[16:04:00] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: which God?
[16:04:09] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: God of Israel. 
[16:04:11] <name100> gay is ok
[16:04:24] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: are you religious?
[16:04:26] <ezekielnoob> there are some gods that are okay with it afaik
[16:04:33] <ezekielnoob> we just have to choose which is a better god
[16:04:34] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yep. Of course.
[16:04:38] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: that god is not possible
[16:04:52] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: he cant be all good and so mean at the same time
[16:04:53] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: so are you also pro-slavery
[16:04:56] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: You are wrong, but make your case if you want.
[16:05:06] <ezekielnoob> i think it's okay to not be okay with gays... as long as you don't push rules to affect them
[16:05:08] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Nope. I'm a catholic.
[16:05:20] <ezekielnoob> as long as nothing goes into laws. it's fine
[16:05:20] <bxgelsan> paging mathu 
[16:05:24] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: and all the suffering on earth caused by natural disasters rules out a good god
[16:05:26] <name100> god is yin yang based so he gives birth to both good and evil and nourish all things
[16:05:34] <bxgelsan> we found a fellow hardline catholic
[16:05:36] <bxgelsan> woot
[16:05:36] <name100> just think how can there be good without evil
[16:05:49] <bxgelsan> :p
[16:05:54] <ezekielnoob> bxgelsan being religious is also okay :p
[16:05:55] <name100> so god must introduce some evil in this world for there to be pleasant things :)
[16:05:59] <bxgelsan> ezekielnoob, it is.
[16:06:02] <ezekielnoob> i don't think he's trying to ifght us
[16:06:03] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: catholics did not even intend for you to read the bible
[16:06:04] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: No it doesnt. Thats like saying that a parent who doesnt allow his kid to eat candy rules out a good parent. 
[16:06:06] <ezekielnoob> he's just expressing his faith
[16:06:26] <bxgelsan> personally i believe in a mesh of agnosticism and mysticism.
[16:06:38] <ezekielnoob> all i know is... life is short
[16:06:40] <bxgelsan> i still havent read the koran yet
[16:06:44] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: That is partly true. People freely reading the bible and interpreting it for themselves leads to heresy.
[16:06:56] <ezekielnoob> i don't know what happens when i die, so i'll just make the most of it while im still alive
[16:07:01] <name100> i think tao is prefered
[16:07:09] <name100> tao != god
[16:07:16] <bxgelsan> but ive read the Bhagavad Gita. Its long.
[16:07:20] <bxgelsan> pretty good story.
[16:07:23] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: its not just things like not allowing to eat candy, how about a father who crushes the  skulls of children killing them?
[16:07:36] <Kill-Animals> ezekielnoob: Okay. You may want to hedge your bets. 
[16:07:53] <name100> world war 2 was a cosmic masochism
[16:08:08] <name100> god is the self playing all these different parts
[16:08:12] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Yeah basically. BTW, are you pro abortion?
[16:08:13] <ezekielnoob> Kill-Animals if there is a real god and he finds my actions abominable and puts me through hell. in my opinion it's not the kind of god i want to follow
[16:08:16] <name100> getting lost in the drama like an actor
[16:08:20] <ezekielnoob> i personally believe i am being a good person
[16:08:23] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: or a parent who drowns all of his children except for his favorite? like in the story of noah
[16:08:33] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals:no, I am anti abortion
[16:08:40] <bxgelsan> o.o
[16:08:46] <bxgelsan> anti womens rights...fml
[16:08:56] <ezekielnoob> this might be getting out of hand
[16:08:59] <ezekielnoob> change topic?
[16:09:07] <bxgelsan> yep
[16:09:09] <Kill-Animals> ezekielnoob: right, but you could just as easily say, "Gods favourite colour is green, and mine is red. Therefore I don't like god" -- its just arbitrary.
[16:09:27] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: but don't you freely read the bible? The bible is pro-slavery in may sections
[16:09:30] <name100> whether there is god it allows all things to happen
[16:09:30] <DunceCotus> yet you are not
[16:09:32] <ezekielnoob> we can discuss this in a separate channel probably Kill-Animals
[16:09:37] <ezekielnoob> we don't wanmt to clutter the channel no more
[16:09:43] <ezekielnoob> im open to conversations

[16:10:11] <bxgelsan> lets discuss.
[16:10:14] <ezekielnoob> bxgelsan man
[16:10:14] <bxgelsan> how about that :P
[16:10:15] <ezekielnoob> lol
[16:10:16] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: oh okay. Well God kills people all the time. Allows for suffering. Even directs satan to inflict it on people like Job. So its not like you are saying anything that is particularly ... unconventional.
[16:10:17] <name100> but ok
[16:10:22] <ezekielnoob> can't ui find a lighter topic :p
[16:10:24] <bxgelsan> ezekielnoob, is that worse?
[16:10:30] <name100> i am this odd fellow :) so god
[16:10:45] <bxgelsan> ive never seen a heated convo on the prison system but im sure people have them.
[16:10:53] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: It is a legitimate argument against religion; I have faith that its all for the good, but even if its not, I don't rule out the possibility of a chaotic and malevolent god. 
[16:10:54] <name100> there is no governor of the body. all organs are in a democracy
[16:10:56] <ezekielnoob> i wanna discuss attack on titan but that also is like discussing war crimes/genocide
[16:11:13] <ezekielnoob> Kill-Animals i appreciate the honesty
[16:11:28] <bxgelsan> ezekielnoob, fun fact: USA has been involve in 107? wars since its inception.
[16:11:34] <name100> we lose ourselves with the illusion of an I that is separate from your mind and body. this I is not you, just another thought :P
[16:11:38] <bxgelsan> war is what drives america :p
[16:11:44] <amigojapan> right Kill-Animals, fortunately that is inconsistent with the idea of a "all good god" which people like aquinas puts foward, anyway, why would you even want to worship such a God?
[16:11:44] <Kill-Animals> ezekielnoob: oh sorry. I didnt mean to bring it up, and tried to shut it down, but I was asked the question again, lol.
[16:11:46] <name100> the real you is the mind and body, mindbody
[16:11:50] <name100> and all of the cosmos
[16:11:53] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: seems like God changes
[16:12:08] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I think relying on one text or interpretation or denomination of God is a bad idea
[16:12:09] <bxgelsan> the real you is your perception of what you feel is"authentic" about yourself, name100 
[16:12:12] <DunceCotus> its unsustainable
[16:12:38] <name100> bxgelsan: you are still under the illusion of an I
[16:12:51] <ezekielnoob> how's the covid restrictions from ya'll countries?
[16:13:00] <ezekielnoob> its' kinda low now here in philippines, im happy
[16:13:02] <bxgelsan> name100, I'm aware of the collective unconcious. Jung is fun.
[16:13:10] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Because life. But you can just read Isaiah 45:7 and that adds context to what "God" is, namely he creates both light and darkness. Good and Evil. 
[16:13:18] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I dont even think that God is possible, and I live more camlmly thinking that the bad things that happen to me either happen of human accord or of the universe being indifferent to human suffering
[16:13:19] <ezekielnoob> but im hearing news that it's rising cases in europe. is it bad?
[16:13:21] <bxgelsan> first book i got was on the shadow self when i was a teen
[16:13:29] <bxgelsan> good read
[16:13:34] <bxgelsan> cant remember most of it now :p
[16:13:42] <name100> :P
[16:13:51] <name100> i just read alan watts ;)
[16:13:56] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: Ihave already read it, yeah, even assumming that that God were real, I would nto woship it
[16:14:02] <bxgelsan> name100, i love allen watts and jung equally.
[16:14:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there is a problem there though.. how can we identify suffering? If the universe is indifferent I mean
[16:14:12] <name100> :)
[16:14:14] <bxgelsan> listened to days of allen watts content.
[16:14:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: are we separate from the universe?
[16:14:19] <Kill-Animals> God is obviously possible. Whether there is a personal god, thats a different question.
[16:14:29] <bxgelsan> I mean, ive listened to it so much. it adds up to days, maybe weeks.
[16:14:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: humans tend to complain about their suffering
[16:14:34] <bxgelsan> name100, ^
[16:14:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: no, we are one with the universe
[16:14:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: doesn't that imply the universe is not indifferent?
[16:14:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well we are a part of it
[16:15:03] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: lol out of spite? Well I'm just happy to be alive. I don't know why that isnt good enough to offer God thanks.
[16:15:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: well, the non human parts are indifferent
[16:15:10] <name100> the universe has no parts DunceCotus it's all one
[16:15:13] <ezekielnoob> i would like to thank god for creating potatoes if he's real
[16:15:18] <name100> parts is an abstraction
[16:15:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: an earthquake does not mean to hurt me
[16:15:31] <bxgelsan> amigojapan, everything you and i say is projection.
[16:15:36] <bxgelsan> same applies to anyone.
[16:15:54] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I am not happy to be alive, I wish God had never made the universe if he was real
[16:16:04] <Kill-Animals> One thing I would like to see, is a real good anime about christianity, that doesnt fall into the same stupid trope, "Da catholic church is da villians!"
[16:16:13] <DunceCotus> name100: if that is the case then the universe is no more indifferent than people are
[16:16:17] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, there was a japanese cult that did that already
[16:16:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: doesn't it?
[16:16:28] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Thats bluff. 
[16:16:28] <bxgelsan> shin reiokio? i cant spell it
[16:16:31] <name100> DunceCotus: the universe is both indifferent and different
[16:16:40] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: maybe try Ruronin Kenshin

[16:17:18] <Kill-Animals> NGE is kind of neat as well.

[16:19:18] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: the writer of   Sailor Moon is also christian and it shows, especially in the final arc
[16:19:22] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: If you kill people, you end their suffering. So go ahead.
[16:19:40] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: you cant know that until you die
[16:19:41] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: that sounds interesting.
[16:19:54] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: that is a materialistic assumption
[16:20:10] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: NO WAY!? REALLY?
[16:20:27] <Kill-Animals> Now that ... is interesting. I dont believe it though, because lesbians 
[16:20:28] <name100> dont Kill-Animals

[16:20:55] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: lol true. I dont know if they continue to suffer or not.
[16:21:49] <name100> if you want the pleasure you need to have the suffereing, jsut think after your pleasure what is going to happen? some suffereing

[16:22:09] <DunceCotus> you can't know even if you die
[16:22:12] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I tend to enjoy my suffering. It adds colour & contrast, and especially meaning to my life. 
[16:22:28] <bxgelsan> nope cant remember it. 
[16:22:31] <name100> life is going to be the same as it was before you died, just you won't be alive to remember it
[16:22:39] <Kill-Animals> maybe not "enjoy", but I am satisfied that it exists.
[16:22:49] <DunceCotus> nah I think life never ends
[16:22:51] <DunceCotus> it only changes
[16:23:07] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: yeah was going to say that you are a massochist

[16:30:57] <Kill-Animals> Honestly the only good argument for God, is the public revelation of him at Mount Sinai, in front of 3 Million Hebrews, who then recorded it as part of their history. Either that even thappened or it didnt.

[16:42:28] <amigojapan> !c ostracize
[16:42:29] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: exclude (someone) from a society or group.
[16:42:42] <amigojapan> yes Kill-Animals, but only murderers
[16:42:50] <DunceCotus> Berlin36: but basically we cannot really return to the function religion once had in society
[16:43:02] <Berlin36> is that bad?
[16:43:03] <DunceCotus> because all religions now go through global capital
[16:43:24] <DunceCotus> they are subordinate to 'rational market agents'
[16:43:36] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: why murderers? If someone murdered my enemies, I'd buy them lunch.

[16:46:27] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I dont believe in punishment, but I do believe that some people should be taken away form a chatroom, not as a punishment but because they disturb the peace fo the chatroom
[16:46:53] <Berlin36> yeah, change your name to Kill-Humans, what did animals do to you?
[16:46:56] <name100> eat, sleep, and shit. this is all you need to do before you die
[16:46:57] <DunceCotus> I don't disbelieve in punishment
[16:46:58] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: for example I believe people in jail should be allowed to dirnk alchohol and play videogames
[16:47:01] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Well I agree with everything you say, and you are awesome btw :)
[16:47:11] <Berlin36> dude ^
[16:47:12] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: because I dont think it shoudl be a punishment
[16:47:21] <amigojapan> thanks Kill-Animals
[16:47:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: isn't being segregated from the rest of society a form of punishment?
[16:47:41] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: lol thats an interesting take on jail. I've thought of similar things but for different reasons.
[16:47:43] <name100> amigojapan: i too believe murderers in jail need beers and vidyagames :P
[16:47:46] <bxgelsan> no alcohol, let them smoke weed, alcohol will make some fight
[16:47:57] <bxgelsan> weed they will just chill the fuck out
[16:48:01] <amigojapan> it is not intended as that DunceCotus, intention is what really matters
[16:48:05] <Kill-Animals> I figure if a guy is addicted to drugs, he should just be locked in a room with an MMORPG, and just supplant his addiction
[16:48:19] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, that only applies to stimulants.
[16:48:19] <amigojapan> nice name100
[16:48:24] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: uuuh
[16:48:32] <bxgelsan> At least if you want to be effective at the game.
[16:48:52] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: what about porn addiction?
[16:48:57] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: fine. Make the game give you drugs every time you kill a mob. Problem Sol-

[16:49:26] <bxgelsan> this is hypothetical
[16:49:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it is, for example, if someone runs over an old woman cause he wanted to murder someone, and someone ran over an old woman cause he was just drunk form a party, those are not both the same kind of crime
[16:49:33] <bxgelsan> got ya. funny

[16:49:35] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: oof. Just move to russia. Pornhub is banned there now, lucky dogs.
[16:49:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:the differencec is just in intention
[16:50:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: intention is super important, more than result
[16:50:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: okay but like segregating people could be felt as a punishment for some 
[16:50:34] <Kill-Animals> I love it when left wing people use Gay as an insult, to immasculate people, because its an acknoledgement of it being a negative force in life.
[16:50:35] <DunceCotus> is it just about intent or also about feels?
[16:50:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Iam sure it will, but if that is not the intention, then it is not
[16:51:05] * Kill-Animals informs the ... youtube and reddit I guess, that this is a joke
[16:51:32] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: not sure if serious
[16:51:32] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, one of my closest gay friends says faggot all the time, he says hes taking it back. hes a bit of a wild card.
[16:51:49] <bxgelsan> so im dulled to words like that but if i hear it in anger
[16:51:51] <bxgelsan> its shitty
[16:51:56] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: he must browse /lgbt/
[16:52:16] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, nah he has a long term partner, hes not into internet shit
[16:52:23] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Anyone who is angry in general over anything, are total losers.
[16:52:26] <bxgelsan> except like one video game, hes a little older than me.
[16:52:31] <bxgelsan> know him from my first job
[16:52:50] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: what about climate destruction
[16:53:03] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: CO2 helps plants grow.
[16:53:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: anger probably will only hurt yourself
[16:53:20] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: for now maybe
[16:53:46] <DunceCotus> would justice be possible without anger 
[16:53:48] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Its been ten times as dense as it is now, and plants flourished.
[16:53:48] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, depends. after being fucked with i became a significantly more angry person. No tolerance for the smallest shit, irl. i finally dont feel like a loser though, that comes from low self esteem at a young age.
[16:53:53] <DunceCotus> or is justice a pseudo-concept
[16:53:53] <bxgelsan> and multiple factors
[16:54:09] <Berlin36> bois
[16:54:10] <Berlin36> stop
[16:54:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it would, cause "justice" does not mean "punishment" it means "fair treatment"
[16:54:25] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, i have to try my hardest now to not punch people who are shit heads.
[16:54:41] <Berlin36> relatable ^
[16:54:45] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: Well I'd have to see what you mean. Because part of being a man, means being in control. If a man has anger, he effectively becomes a woman, because he is subjest to his emotions.
[16:54:46] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what is fair about segregation?
[16:55:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: are we talking about murderers?
[16:55:13] <DunceCotus> sure
[16:55:27] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, i have anger but i do not act out.
[16:55:33] <bxgelsan> no, i didnt murder anyone.
[16:55:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: cause normal society cant live calmly with murderers running rampant
[16:55:35] <bxgelsan> amigo
[16:55:39] <bxgelsan> or i wouldnt be here.
[16:55:46] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: So if I can come up to you, and insult you and make you "ANGRY", then I can control you in a way. But if what you meant was, "If someone challenges me to a fight, I no longer back down", thats a differnt thing entirely.
[16:55:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it is not even the fault of the murderers I know
[16:55:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what produces the murderers?
[16:56:15] <DunceCotus> segregation will not fix that
[16:56:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: probably some kind of mental problem
[16:56:18] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: you make it sound like you have just learned to stand up for yourself.
[16:56:21] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, thats more correct bit im snappy from mental issues

[16:57:05] <Kill-Animals> bxgelsan: nice. Keep on fighting and ... killing I guess 
[16:57:12] <bxgelsan> no, i dont do that.
[16:57:19] <Kill-Animals> oh yeah me neither
[16:57:19] <bxgelsan> i only had to do things in there to survive.

[16:57:27] <Kill-Animals> killing is one of my least favourite things to do.
[16:57:27] <bxgelsan> thats life.
[16:57:57] <name100> killing an ant is the great problem of life
[16:58:05] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: surely the fairer way would be to address what is producing the mental problems that make people murdery
[16:58:06] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: could be born with it, caused by chemical abuse , or mistreatment, maybe other reasons
[16:58:24] <name100> ants need to live 
[16:58:28] <name100> i think ants are great
[16:58:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we do that, putting them first in mental hospitals
[16:59:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that's just treating the symptom
[16:59:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: not always a clear cut known reason
[16:59:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: and it singles them out as the problem
[16:59:59] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Most mental hospitals shut down because of an overreaction to some treatments, and the belief that integrating insane people into normal society will improve them rather than make society less stable

[17:13:04] <bxgelsan> Kill-Animals, Und wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst, blickt der Abgrund auch in dich hinein.
[17:13:18] <bxgelsan> nietzche
[17:13:36] <Sadale> lol there're so many support on Ukraine. Makes me wonder what'd happen if I say something supporting Russia for lulz.
[17:13:38] <DunceCotus> Nietzche in his German phase
[17:13:47] <bxgelsan> ...
[17:13:51] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, really?
[17:13:57] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: rally
[17:14:04] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Imagine you are a judge, and you ask someone who is guilty, what do you think their punishment should be -- Are they going to say, "Death Penalty" or "Nah just let me off the hook?"
[17:14:13] <bxgelsan> its a solid quote.
[17:14:20] <Sadale> Perhaps I could put up a bannar on my website saying "[Z] Sadale Supports Russia [Z]" or something :P
[17:14:31] <DunceCotus> a solid quote I am sure will be translated for us
[17:14:33] <DunceCotus> eventually
[17:14:38] <bxgelsan> oh
[17:14:41] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: as I already said, I dont believe in punishment
[17:14:58] <Kill-Animals> Sadale: I support russia. Zelensky is a war criminal.
[17:14:59] <DunceCotus> is it a matter of belief?
[17:15:02] <bxgelsan> i can explain it in a less educated way so let me google
[17:15:05] <Sadale> lol
[17:15:22] <bxgelsan> English: “Whoever battles monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster himself. And when you look long into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you.”
[17:15:23] <Sadale> I'm mostly just popcorning in regard of this war. I have no stance just like a baka ranger :3
[17:15:31] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Then to me, its saying that you are a bad person, in a round about way.
[17:15:52] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: oh yeah that one

[17:16:07] <bxgelsan> :P
[17:16:26] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: You can take another angle to it. This is sometimes used in politics. Donald Trump once said that he thinks drug dealers should get the death penalty.
[17:16:29] <DunceCotus> you know we used to call animals 'pocket monsters'
[17:16:48] <bxgelsan> so pokemon
[17:16:50] <amigojapan> ok Kill-Animals
[17:16:53] <Kill-Animals> Now I doubt he believes that, but it was so extreme, that it convinced the voters that Donald Trump really hates drugs, more than any other candidate.

[17:18:14] <DunceCotus> Donald Trump hates drugs but not as much as he hates immigrants
[17:18:32] <bxgelsan> Sadale, i figured youd get the gist, because he lengthens the words in the song

[17:20:45] <bxgelsan> there. 18 minutes of sheer nuts.
[17:21:03] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Japan hates immigrants too, and yet all people want to immigrate there. And a lot of immigrants hate the countries they reside in... which is why they came? 
[17:21:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: hyperdimensional entities people interact with on drugs I guess
[17:21:41] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I dont hate Japan and i have lived here for 20 years
[17:21:53] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, Terrance McKenna fan?
[17:22:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I will just avoid taking illegal drugs
[17:22:13] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: sure
[17:22:21] <name100> terence mckenna best
[17:22:24] <name100> :)
[17:22:42] <bxgelsan> nice, he was a bit kooky but fun to listen to. hes intelligent as shit but its obvious hes taken way too many drugs.
[17:22:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it can be risky destratifying too quickly
[17:22:51] <bxgelsan> psychedelic ones specifically.
[17:23:02] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Yeah well I live in Canada, and just about every immigrant hates the founding stock in some way or another.
[17:23:23] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: well without his drug taking could he have been as insightful?
[17:23:30] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals:ok, but dont make generalisations about Japan
[17:23:45] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, he wouldn't think the same way.
[17:23:57] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: right
[17:23:57] <bxgelsan> and his insights came from a lot of DMT
[17:24:08] <bxgelsan> which is pretty amazing tbh
[17:24:17] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Oh I don't think immigrants in japan hate japan, because japan is more or less unapologetically homogenous.
[17:24:19] <DunceCotus> DMT has never really worked for me
[17:24:24] <DunceCotus> but its hard to do properly it seems
[17:24:24] <bxgelsan> once is enough when you meet an entity.
[17:24:37] <bxgelsan> and leave the body.
[17:24:44] <amigojapan> ah ok Kill-Animals, I thought you were talking about Japan
[17:24:45] <Kill-Animals> With that unapologetic homogeneity, comes a respect. Its a people willing to stand up for themselves.

[17:25:58] <Kill-Animals> Well there is a lot to say, but I think people would be so lucky to be born japanese. 
[17:26:04] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, its a problem of lack of consistent DMT production, and you probably didn't keep the lighter far away enough and move it properly to get it vaporized in a glass pipe. then 2 more hits.
[17:26:11] <bxgelsan> its difficult after the first if you did it right.

[17:29:05] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: and yeah I doubt I vaped it properly
[17:29:48] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, if you are so inclined they make DMT carts for people that dont know how to do it properly. or cant.
[17:29:53] <bxgelsan> but dont do it if its illegal
[17:29:55] <bxgelsan> in your country
[17:30:09] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: I'm happy doing certain illegal things
[17:30:15] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, thats fine.
[17:31:24] <bxgelsan> though most likely the cart will just contain synthetic 5-meo-dmt.
[17:31:25] <DunceCotus> bxgelsan: I have tripped on other substances like shrooms and DXM, MDMA
[17:31:36] <DunceCotus> so its not like I can't trip

[22:01:33] <ButterNoodle> u live in one of the most oppressive states for gun ownership.. concealed carry permits are "shall issue" meaning someone makes a decision on whether u can carry concealed or not.. and they dont issue them
[22:01:34] <emmeka> JesseDesu not all states actually permit open carry, and not all of them allow you to do it without a permit

[22:02:13] <JesseDesu> or does it need to be out of sight
[22:02:20] <ButterNoodle> and some places like Illinois and NJ require u to have a license to even purchase/own a firearm
[22:02:22] <emmeka> it's usually the opposite.
[22:02:27] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: depends
[22:02:31] <emmeka> open carry laws are more permissive than concealed carry.

[22:04:58] <ButterNoodle> yea ik the canada situation.. and self defense with a firearm is a last resort there
[22:05:10] <emmeka> guns must be under trigger lock unless in use on private land. the only exception are the very rare carry permits issued by police to those with proveable danger to their life. for the most part, this gets issued to polar bear guards in arctic towns :P
[22:05:26] <mathu> "self defense with a firearm is a last resort there" - is it not a last resort in the usa???
[22:05:31] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: not really, open carry'ers can get their shit taken from them and used in a crime

[22:05:58] <mathu> ah yeah castle doctrine
[22:06:01] <mathu> i guess
[22:06:04] <ButterNoodle> I mean.. some of it is reasonable.. some of it no so much

[22:06:12] <ButterNoodle> no duty to retreat..
[22:06:15] <ButterNoodle> things like that
[22:06:16] <JesseDesu> for conceal carry
[22:06:22] <emmeka> in this country, we do not, or at least nominally do not
[22:06:27] <mathu> certainly not a last resort for cops
[22:06:35] <emmeka> in practice we do so long as the shooter is white and the one shot is not
[22:06:47] <ButterNoodle> well mathu.. police carry guns to defend them self
[22:06:55] <emmeka> see e.g. shooting of Colten Boushie.
[22:07:05] <emmeka> that trial was a shitshow if there ever was one
[22:07:10] <mathu> ButterNoodle: yeah, but they blast unarmed people who are running away

[22:07:31] <mathu> emmeka: colten boushie is a cool name
[22:07:32] <emmeka> ButterNoodle as someone who knows their way around a gun you'd love the defence on that one. it's hilarious.
[22:07:53] <ButterNoodle> mathu: thats one thing.. but I've seen a lot of "justified shootings" that could have been dealt w non-leathal just as easy
[22:08:16] <mathu> ButterNoodle: defo agree
[22:08:18] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: I'll look that one up.. is it as laughable as alec boldwin?
[22:08:24] <JesseDesu> i leave my airsoft in its foam box
[22:08:36] <ButterNoodle> mathu: a lot of these cases I see are mental health issues

[22:09:07] <ButterNoodle> I mean its a social problem.. dont call the cops on ur mentally ill kid.. they are gonna get shot
[22:09:10] <JesseDesu> *luncheon meat
[22:09:19] <ButterNoodle> mathu: he's a cunt
[22:09:30] <emmeka> so basically this native guy was trying to steal an ATV while drunk, and the ATV owner (on his own property) fired two warning shots, at which point the attempted thiefs tried to flee, but crashed their car. The ATV owner then walked up and shot an unarmed man in cold blood while he was behind the wheel of a crashed car.
[22:09:45] <emmeka> his defence, as presented, was that the shot was a hangfire from the previous warning shot
[22:10:06] <emmeka> and that he reached into the car... with the hand that held the gun... and tried to take the thieves' keys
[22:10:09] <JesseDesu> hangfire?
[22:10:09] <ButterNoodle> hang fire? was he aiming a mortar at him?
[22:10:15] <emmeka> and that at this point the hangfire discharged

[22:12:37] <ButterNoodle> must be dialup between the hammer and primer
[22:12:42] <MootPoot> hangfire is when she asks you to hang on until she cums
[22:12:46] <emmeka> MootPoot right, it's beyond implausible that he fired a warning shot, walked over to the crashed car, reached in, and *then* the gun discharged. It'd be like a world record hangfire. Besides that... picture in your mind... he supposedly reached into the vehicle *with the hand holding a handgun* to grab the keys.
[22:12:56] <emmeka> is that a motion that makes any sense
[22:12:57] * ButterNoodle waits to cum together
[22:13:18] <mathu> also reaching for the keys with the gun still pointed at the the driver
[22:13:21] <ButterNoodle> yea warning shots are kinda stupid imho
[22:13:31] <mathu> if the keys are in the ignition you're holding the gun some kinda fucked up sideways way
[22:13:33] <ButterNoodle> its negligent
[22:13:35] <MootPoot> warning shots work...against animals
[22:13:43] <ButterNoodle> depends on the animal
[22:13:47] <emmeka> mathu this isn't even his claim. it's more ridiculous. he claims he just used the hand the gun was in to grab the keys.

[22:20:26] <Nanobot> A UX designer starts a fast food restaurant. Instead of having menus, which just scream "outdated UX paradigms", he has the staff make all of the items they offer and circulate them on a conveyor belt for customers to select. AB testing shows that customers are more likely to select items if the number of items is smaller, so he makes dramatic cuts to the variety of offerings. Bacon cheeseburgers, chicken burgers, blue cheese burgers, and veggie burgers 
[22:20:27] <Nanobot> are all reduced down to just the most popular item: basic cheeseburgers. Customers complain that they don't like the offerings, so he uses machine learning to determine customer preferences. This leads to replacing the buns with cheese and adding a special "for you" section consisting of things like mint-flavored burgers and cantaloupe hotdogs. Nobody ever likes the "for you" items, but people still sometimes buy them out of pure curiosity, which leads 
[22:20:27] <Nanobot> the machine learning to see it as a huge success. The restaurant's metrics go through the roof, and they eventually shut down because everyone hates it.
