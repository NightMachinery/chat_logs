When I recovered from shock, I told him that smoking was far more ubiquitous in the Soviet Union, and anti-smoking campaigns far less developed. That momentarily stumped him. My
[01:14:23] <feepbot> mother was also at Rutgers at the time as a piano instructor. She once got into a heated argument over lunch with a colleague and friend after he lamented America's appalling treatment of the old and the sick. She ventured that, from her ex-Soviet vantage point, it didn't seem that bad. "Are you telling me that it's just as bad in the Soviet Union?" her colleague retorted, only to
[01:14:23] <feepbot> be dumbstruck when my mother clarified that, actually, she meant it was much worse. She tried to illustrate her point by telling him about my grandmother's sojourn in an overcrowded Soviet hospital ward: More than once, when the woman in the next bed rolled over in her sleep, her arm flopped across my grandma's body.

[01:56:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've seen this sort of thing (the people who hang out on the DSL Discord have a bad case of it), where someone decides that the Soviet Union was "evil" (a rather childish way of looking at things, but on the whole, more right than wrong), and then reasons from that to "everything about the Soviet Union was bad, nothing about it was good, and anyone who says that anything in, about, or having to do with the USSR was, in any
[01:56:04] <Obormot\Arcturus>  way, good or positive or just not terrible, is ipso facto wrong, and probably also an evil communist"
[01:57:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is nonsense. Lots of things were good. Which is not to say that the good things somehow "justify" the bad things (a common strawman that such people trot out), but they don't actually need to; *facts* do not, in fact, have to "justify" anything in order to be *true*

[02:01:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> ""The Soviet Union did not rest on the gulag alone. There was also enthusiasm, construction, the spread of education and social advancement for millions," Singer asserted, lamenting that the Black Book approach made it impossible to "comprehend why millions of the best and brightest rallied behind the red flag or…turned a blind eye to the crimes committed in its name." (It was apparently not satisfying to answer with the
[02:01:59] <Obormot\Arcturus>  pithy phrase coined by statistician and essayist Nassim Nicholas Taleb: Because they were "intellectuals-yet-idiots.")" ... is that really a *sufficient* explanation, though? Does it explain anything?
[02:02:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's true! But it's not an *explanation*
[02:02:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Must we really decline to understand communism in order to condemn it?
[02:03:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> One gets the impression, sometimes, that some people are afraid that if they understand *why* the people who fought for communism did what they did, acted as they did, then they'll find it impossible to maintain their moral stance against it!
[02:04:13] <galambo_> communism is social desirability bias taken to its logical conclusion. 
[02:05:20] <saturn2> what is communism? we just don't know.
[02:05:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am tempted in such cases to be like, "It's ok, guys. Communism really is evil, I promise. It's super evil and terrible and if you actually educate yourself and come to understand the reasons why its architects and defenders did what they did, it'll actually *still* be evil and terrible, so don't be afraid of abandoning your ignorance"
[02:05:52] <galambo_> communism should have the stigma of nazism
[02:06:14] <galambo_> didnt stalin/mao kill more people than hitler?
[02:06:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo_: Even Nazism shouldn't have the stigma of Nazism
[02:06:32] <galambo_> also socialism should have the same stigma of fascism
[02:06:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> galambo_: Mao did, Stalin I think might be trickier to count that high
[02:06:36] <kuudes> well, fantasy communism is as good as fantasy nazism or fantasy libertarianism, I suppose
[02:06:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disagree
[02:07:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I very much dislike the "well sure it looks good on paper" meme for communism (and I think it's partly related to the phenomenon I just described)
[02:08:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, it only looks good on paper if you haven't got your morality straight. Actually, if you have a sane and sensible view of the world and of people, communism looks absolutely terrible on paper; it's obviously fundamentally unfair and unjust and antithetical to freedom, personal virtue, etc.
[02:08:07] <saturn2> it's obvious that these people are speaking in bad faith since they never even bother to total up the people killed by western governments in the same time period
[02:08:21] <kuudes> samurai/knight hero societies seem sort of similar related to fascism as idealistic industrial socialism fantasies, maybe
[02:08:36] <kuudes> saturn2, well, chile etc
[02:08:59] <saturn2> is it half? ten times less? a thousand times less? who knows! we're just meant to implicitly assume it's zero
[02:09:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Contrast with libertarianism, which *does* look good on paper, with the problem being "we can't get there, and if we got there, we wouldn't stay there" - whereas for communism the problem is "we can't get there, which is actually good, because if we got there, we'd want to run away screaming")
[02:09:59] <saturn2> i think communism on paper is the same as libertarianism on paper
[02:10:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, actually the same? Or do you mean, like... equally good/bad?
[02:10:24] <saturn2> the differences are mostly in emphasis
[02:11:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> "n the opinion pages of The New York Times, Kristen Ghodsee, a professor of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania, dubiously declared that women had better sex under Soviet-style socialism, a thesis she then expanded into a slim book lauding communist strides toward gender equality." ... wat

[02:12:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The USSR's ideology was not only a threat to capitalism, it was a threat to white supremacy." ... hah!
[02:15:11] <galambo_> I think people in regressive regimes have better sex because they have nothing better to do?

[02:23:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Shopping alone was practically a full-time job, between standing in line and going from store to store to find different items; once the shopping was done, you had to factor in some extra time for scraping dirt off the vegetables and throwing out the rotten ones, trying to find the edible parts of what the store laughingly called a steak, or salvaging the milk from a leaky carton."
[02:23:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, first of all, the article uses this as an example of ... how Soviet women weren't *actually* liberated?
[02:23:51] <kuudes> saturn2, I guess https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States#Covert_actions lists at least 200k + 500k mass murdered by western side

[02:32:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct line is obviously "Communism was and is an evil ideology and the Soviet Union's attempts to implement it brought about vast suffering and horror and misery, and this is true despite the fact that there were actually some good things about the Soviet system and Soviet culture"
[02:33:09] <galambo_> Obormot\Arcturus, communism is not unique to the ussr

[03:10:53] <shawwwn> galambo_: I agree with kuudes. I was mildly hopeful to hear your socialism ideas 
[03:11:00] <pompolic> marxists going "how do you do fellow kids", the sub
[03:13:33] <galambo_> kuudes, fair enough. I believe that socialism is similar to fascism
[03:13:45] <galambo_> so if someone says we need to raise taxes
[03:14:01] <galambo_> that is similar to saying we need to restrict free speech a bit more
[03:14:37] <galambo_> they might have a sensible rationale for their beliefs
[03:15:05] <galambo_> and we do need a small amount of 'fascism' in our society in order for it to function
[03:16:24] <galambo_> so taxing people for basic government services like police, firefighting, healthcare emergencies is probably more beneficial than harmful
[03:19:05] <kuudes> but not for education or welfare or military or courts or roads?
[03:19:33] <kuudes> also in usa there are private firefighters who let your house burn down if you have not paid your fire insurance before the fire
[03:20:13] <kuudes> also taxes don't cover healthcare emergencies in usa, isn't it?
[03:20:30] <adiabatic> kuudes: they do if you're on medicaid or medi-cal
[03:20:32] <kuudes> it is just made into law that the hospital has a duty to care for you but they can post-fact bill you
[03:21:00] <CoJaBo> There are few things I take more glee in, than stonewalling Karens to our legal department
[03:21:10] <kuudes> adiabatic, yes, but in most of the rest of the world you go into hospital and get treated and then go out
[03:21:15] <galambo_> I am against welfare. the poorest person in denmark has a higher income than the richest person in mozambique. if you have true empathy for poor people you would want to help people in poor countries before worrying about your fellow countrymen
[03:21:58] <kuudes> "the poorest person in denmark has a higher income than the richest person in mozambique" this seems unexpected
[03:22:13] <kuudes> are there not a single millionaire in mozambique?
[03:22:48] <gwern> yeah, that's going too far. there are lower bounds at zero, and kleptocrats
[03:22:57] <galambo_> (maybe not literally richer but say the poorest 1% in denmark has a higher income than the highest earning 99% in mozambique)
[03:23:07] <gwern> I would expect even the 1st/99th probably still overlap
[03:23:16] <gwern> remember, it's easy to earn $0
[03:23:39] * gwern spelled that 'kelptocrats' and that's an interesting idea isn't it
[03:24:29] <galambo_> I remember seeing a graph of the incomes of both countries and there was almost no overlap
[03:24:32] <adiabatic> gwern: reminds me of the jungle waterbenders
[03:24:37] <galambo_> anyways thats beside the point

[03:25:54] <shawwwn> gwern: MAKE ALGAE GREAT AGAIN
[03:25:59] <galambo_> because if you gentuinely care about the poor you would be trying to donate to an EA charity and encouraging people/governments to do the same
[03:25:59] <kuudes> "Net Worth in 2021 	$1 Million - $5 Million"
[03:26:03] <gwern> 'the red tide comes! brothers, we ride!'
[03:26:51] <kuudes> "you would be trying to donate" why try? AMF takes SEPA transfers?
[03:27:07] <kuudes> you just wire money from your account and it gets transformed into malaria nets
[03:27:09] <galambo_> kuudes, basic education is good but it is unclear if higher education is useful. and besides you can import professionals from poor countries for free
[03:27:22] <kuudes> but they are worse
[03:27:32] <galambo_> kuudes, what a pity
[03:28:22] <kuudes> personally, I am both for more money transfers to developing countries and for more allowed migration to developed countries.
[03:28:58] <kuudes> but I don't see how that should transform for me wanting more of our tax moneys to be left to well off people? O_o
[03:29:02] <kuudes> that sounds odd
[03:29:15] <kuudes> why should I want to reduce taxes for rich people?
[03:29:52] <kuudes> I mean, if I per your logic indeed agree that people from poorer countries should be allowed to move in here, and we should give more money to poor people in poor countries
[03:29:59] <galambo_> governments do a lot of things. we dont have research or empirical evidence on whether most of these interventions are useful
[03:30:11] <kuudes> why should I deduce that because I believe so I should want more money to be given to Wahlroos and Herlin?
[03:30:30] <kuudes> I mean, plenty of Herlins are swell people and do ecological protection etc, I guess?
[03:30:32] <galambo_> and most government interventions restrict freedoms and come with their own harms
[03:30:48] <kuudes> most people in finland get more public services than they pay taxes for
[03:31:02] <kuudes> because we also tax companies etc
[03:31:08] <galambo_> so its like a doctor from the 17th century talking about humours and doing medical interventions that have no scientific basis
[03:31:16] <galambo_> and forcing people to have those medical interventions
[03:31:33] <galambo_> thats what governments are doing today
[03:31:35] <kuudes> we get free school, near free daycare, near free healthcare, free roads, etc
[03:32:19] <galambo_> kuudes, yes but you pay a lot of taxes and you have lots of stupid laws. you dont know how life would have been like if your country had less taxes
[03:32:21] <kuudes> also we get things like government paying the logistic chain to keep longer stocks than are strictly economically optimal, to prepare for times like covid etc so that we don't run out of stuff
[03:32:24] <galambo_> it could be even better than it is
[03:32:32] <kuudes> that feels unlikely
[03:32:49] <galambo_> well you simply dont know
[03:33:05] <kuudes> should we have let covid put under the healthy businesses?
[03:33:14] <galambo_> if we take a generalised view we find that countries that have too much government or too little government tend to do badly
[03:33:33] <galambo_> your government is bordering on being too much government
[03:33:34] <kuudes> we didn't. instead the government took loans and subsidized taxes and we paid unemployment benefits etc
[03:34:02] <kuudes> should people in finland get pension?
[03:34:50] <galambo_> kuudes, well I came to the UK 4 years ago and within that time I became financially independent
[03:34:53] <kuudes> I mean, that is sort of private money, but guaranteed and licenced by the government, who also enforces that pension funds must take over from each other if one of them fails
[03:35:07] <galambo_> if I can do it so can native people who spent all their lives in the country
[03:35:22] <kuudes> that is suboptimal per bank of finland research
[03:36:00] <kuudes> as low social welfare prediction by people increases savings rate, which increases the need for capital cluts, so there are more money to be managed in order to keep the economy performing within specs
[03:36:07] <galambo_> again the average finn is probably earning like 97th percentile of world income. if they are unable to save up enough money for retirement theres soemthing wrong with them
[03:36:15] <kuudes> higher social welfare prediction seems to optimize the economy
[03:36:39] <kuudes> it is hard to save for retirement when currency median life expectancy is 49 years
[03:36:39] <galambo_> or maybe people decide to slack off and live off benefits?
[03:36:49] <kuudes> and human median life expectancy is 75 years
[03:37:15] <kuudes> ie people who are now on pension have been in worklife when there was no euro but instead 10% inflation per year
[03:37:24] <galambo_> you can always invest your money or try to change your monetary policy. thats another thing government interferes with unnecesarily
[03:37:27] <kuudes> and frequent devaluations of currency
[03:37:36] <kuudes> no you couldn't
[03:37:58] <kuudes> same as with lower development economies, in the past it was not free for everyone to be allowed to invest into stock market
[03:38:12] <kuudes> it was basically restricted to licenced investors
[03:38:12] <galambo_> is it because of government restrictions?
[03:38:21] <kuudes> markets, oligopolies
[03:38:21] <galambo_> :D
[03:38:31] <galambo_> so its the governments fault
[03:38:41] <kuudes> basicly your bank could frontrun your investment if you profited for example
[03:38:49] <kuudes> not government, there was too little investor protection
[03:38:54] <kuudes> just look into usa in 80s or before
[03:39:09] <kuudes> wolf of wall street etc
[03:39:41] <galambo_> sure you can argue investor protection and anti fraud is nice and shouuld be part of police
[03:39:46] <kuudes> the current state where you can predict that if you have 1000 e in your account today, you will also have 1000 e in your account a month from now and can buy similar stuff then as you can now, is a high development state
[03:40:06] <kuudes> it was not like that in the 80s even in most of the western world
[03:40:24] <galambo_> or you can find a reputable bank in another more stable government that would take your money
[03:40:35] <kuudes> this whole free market we enjoy now is sort of end result from 90s free trade negotiations
[03:40:43] <kuudes> there were no such states
[03:41:13] <galambo_> I know that in the 80s there was a change in the policy about bonds being callable
[03:41:16] <kuudes> you know in 70s finland lost 10% of its working age population to migration to sweden
[03:41:18] <galambo_> but I dont know much more
[03:41:38] <kuudes> we had our economic crisis in the early 90s. but south east europe had wars then
[03:41:54] <kuudes> a nice thing is that 2008 didn't result in any wars in western countries
[03:42:05] <kuudes> 10-20 years into the past it would have done so
[03:42:25] <galambo_> kuudes, looks like the free market doing its job. if your country is unable to compete with wages why should its citizens stay? they would be better off going to a country that has better management
[03:42:28] <galambo_> thats what I did
[03:42:28] <kuudes> so yes, current market state is indeed good. but it wasn't always so
[03:42:40] <kuudes> and it required a lot of coordination, and especially government action
[03:43:06] <kuudes> yes, because we had nordic free movement area since 50s
[03:43:13] <kuudes> iirc before schengen
[03:43:20] <galambo_> socialists would probably oppose free trade
[03:43:22] <kuudes> if you lived in hungary or something you could not move
[03:43:29] <galambo_> look ata  country like georgia
[03:43:38] <galambo_> they were a poor country under ussr
[03:43:39] <kuudes> georgia didn't exist as a country in 80s

[03:50:24] <gwern> it's not totally surprising. people have been using emojis in clever ways for a long time. like 15kun uses Torchmoji for sentiment - that's based off taking tweets with emoticons/emojis and using those as the sentiment label of the text

[03:51:12] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life_ (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[03:51:27] <shawwwn> yeah. I think it surprised me because  the ghost emoji isn't actually a label for a ghost. but even that argument falls flat, because of course it's a label for a ghost
[03:51:45] <shawwwn> you may as well just substitute "ghost" with 👻 every time you write a sentence
[03:52:19] <shawwwn> but still, it had to infer that 👻 and "ghost" mean the same thing, and form the same associations
[03:52:29] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[03:52:39] <shawwwn> yet that's totally unsurprising too, because that's the definition of a trained word embedding model thing
[03:52:48] <shawwwn> since words with similar meanings cluster together in latent space
[03:53:08] <gwern> also, there's GPT-3
[03:53:08] <shawwwn> so 👻 just became progressively closer and closer to "ghost" over the course of millions of captions
[03:53:22] <gwern> GPT-3 knows perfectly well how to swap ghost with ghost emoji
[03:53:28] <shawwwn> still though, how many labeled captions exist in its training set containing 👻 ?
[03:53:40] <gwern> if you can learn that purely from text, surely learning it from paired text/image captions is even easier?
[03:53:42] <shawwwn> like ... maybe a few thousand?
[03:57:40] <shawwwn> wait, sanity check: CLIP was trained on image caption pairs, right?
[03:57:55] <shawwwn> now I'm second guessing myself because of its whole contrastive loss function thing
[03:58:24] <shawwwn> if it's using contrastive loss with images and text projected into the same latent space, then technically it's not pairing images with text

[04:08:45] <linear> (which, like, is similar to crypto in general, and I *love* the idea of crypto and use it myself! but, I didn't think they'd ever get *that8 popular)

[04:09:15] <shawwwn> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive is still my favorite
[04:09:20] <Obormot\Gaia> NFTs are much more a scam, and much more obvious a scam, than crypto ever was
[04:09:26] <feepbot> NFTs - SNL - YouTube
[04:09:47] <linear> well, when I say 'crypto' in general, I mean, for example, if we select a coin at random from cmc and look at its implementation/promises/market cap/innovative tech
[04:09:57] <linear> in which case, I think the average case would be... not particularly thrilling
[04:10:11] <Obormot\Gaia> It is, frankly, almost unbelievably absurd that anyone can claim with a straight face that NFTs have real value or buying an NFT constitutes acquiring something of real use or benefit etc.
[04:10:18] <Obormot\Gaia> i.e, that they're not an extremely obvious scam
[04:10:40] <linear> mostly agree but people can believe all types of crazy things when they 1) read primarily lies about it and 2) are making boatloads of money from it
[04:11:15] <shawwwn> I'm so amused that everyone owns a URL, not an image
[04:11:35] <shawwwn> congrats, you used crypto to guarantee that the url won't change
[04:11:36] <linear> it's worse, since nft metadata is often off-chain as well. oh, and nft minting, pre-purchase (in some cases post)
[04:11:42] <linear> well, it's worse in 100 other ways, but, uhh.
[04:11:42] <linear> yeah
[04:12:01] <shawwwn> the least important aspect of the NFT is the only aspect with cryptographic security
[04:12:56] <linear> decentralized blockchains are (as we know) extremely redundant and costly, so the majority of every crypto projects tries as hard as they can to circumvent the usage of actual decentralized blockchains, so that their product actually works in a reasonable way with respect to data and speed
[04:13:11] <linear> things have improved *a lot* over the last few years, but these types of patterns are still very common
[04:13:57] <linear> (and yes now we have some projects that scale better in various ways, but we're still far from e.g. being able to cheaply upload smart contracts to large systems like ethereum)
[04:14:23] <gwern> I still don't understand why the url/hash thing wasn't fixed as soon as it was pointed out. why aren't the programmers on the backend doing the sane thing? it's crypto! we hash *everything*, even things that don't need to be hashed just in case that might be helpful
[04:14:39] <Obormot\Gaia> Because they don't care
[04:14:42] <Obormot\Gaia> Why should they care?
[04:14:48] <Obormot\Gaia> NFTs are for making money off rubes
[04:14:49] <saturn2> the really amusing thing is that actually secure NFT implementations had already been invented years ago, but nobody cared
[04:14:58] <linear> the only objective to be optimized for is basically making money, so I'd basically say what Obormot\Gaia said
[04:15:35] <linear> (which partly is why this is frustrating! Crypto has some *really really cool tech*! But no one gives a shit since it's not related to making money, which is the central goal of >99% of participants in the ecosystem)
[04:15:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Any who has a brain and thinks about it for like five minutes, if that, can readily see that when you pay money for an NFT, what you get in exchange is literally *nothing*, and thus people with an IQ above their body temperature don't buy NFTs
[04:16:03] <saturn2> the important part is the marketing
[04:16:19] <Obormot\Gaia> So what possible incentive could there be to spend so much as an iota of effort on making things more secure or wtfever
[04:16:51] <linear> Obormot\Gaia: Actually that is something that bugs me even MORE about markets as of the last few years. Namely, that I can analyze an asset, decide it's basically terrible and a scam, however *still think it would be very smart to purchase it*, because I think many others are likely to think it's amazing and buy it after I buy it
[04:17:41] <Obormot\Gaia> linear: Yes, tulip bubbles, but that has the well-known risk of... what happened to the tulip bubble
[04:18:55] <linear> yes, but if it's basically a generalized keynesian beauty contest, you can actually perform pretty well, you just need a good model of what other people are likely to buy and get hyped up about, even if the actual thing itself is stupid. The worst possible outcome for (most..) investments is -100%, and since bubbles can give 100x+ returns, I think the ROI (especially for those lucky enough..) is often 
[04:18:55] <linear> high enough to warrant such rampant speculation without solid fundamentals
[04:20:51] <Obormot\Gaia> I agree that this is terrible
[04:21:44] <gwern> the tulip bubble wasn't really real, and it was actually a very durable centuries-long trade to be in with interesting dynamics due to the tulip-breaking virus and the fact that you'd literally use up the coolest tulips
[04:21:56] <linear> it's also pretty exhausting like, the amount of people I'd follow on twitter whose feed would go from interesting content to 5% crypto, and then 20% crypto, and then 50% NFTs and crypto, and then 100% NFTs, and then I can't help but unfollow at some point
[04:22:12] <linear> (exhausting enough that I constantly declined doing crypto/NFT projects too, apparently)

[04:27:13] <feepbot> Driving the point home, Anti Taylor recalled spending a few days window shopping in London before arriving in Moscow. He was “impressed, though not surprised.” Shops in Accra were “equally fascinating” and London was “nothing new under the sun.” After two years in Moscow, however, the “light, color, and luxuriance” of these same shops “overwhelmed” him,
[04:27:13] <feepbot> suggesting that in the hierarchy of cultures, Accra was closer to the glitz of London and far from the drabness of Moscow. “Perhaps,” Anti Taylor admitted, “this was the old, long suspected bourgeois coming out in me.”35 But Taylor was not alone in this evaluation.

[20:10:53] <gwern> randomness/badbrains. there are more ways to be broken than not
[20:11:30] <gwern> if you imagine each one as a knob or dial and whack them at random...
[20:12:50] <two2thehead> pompolic, you are reading the table correctly
[20:14:32] <catern> rmmh: that's kind of surprising, where did you get that stat from?
[20:14:46] <rmmh> I've been archiving 4chan threads
[20:14:53] <rmmh> (not the images)
[20:14:57] <catern> did you filter out any images?
[20:15:06] <rmmh> this is from analyzing the post json itself
[20:15:22] <rmmh> actually archiving all the images takes something like >10TB/yr iirc
[20:15:24] <catern> so how do you know what image is attached to the post? are they hashed or something?
[20:15:35] <rmmh> yes, they helpfully include an MD5 hash of the image
[20:15:43] <spxtr> 10 TB/yr is surprisingly low, no?
[20:15:48] <rmmh> makes dedupe quite simple :)
[20:16:00] <rmmh> spxtr: I could find precise numbers, but yeah, it's not *that* much
[20:16:11] <catern> 10TB/yr unique images sounds kind of plausible
[20:16:52] <rmmh> I sent the dataset to shawwwn to maybe do some GPT stuff
[20:17:00] <rmmh> idk if he ended up poking at it
[20:17:11] <catern> rmmh: how'd you work back from the hash to the image, out of curiosity?
[20:17:29] <rmmh> popular images are still in live threads, so you just find a recent thread with the hash
[20:17:45] <catern> ah
[20:18:12] <catern> is there a hash-based image lookup on 4chan or do you have to have a valid filename?
[20:18:18] <spxtr> seems like you could store a db of hash -> thumbnail, just so you have an idea
[20:18:29] <rmmh> spxtr: yeah, I have quite a few thumbnails
[20:18:35] <rmmh> I stopped grabbing thumbs for a few years though
[20:18:49] <spxtr> for how long have you been doing this?
[20:18:56] <rmmh> on and off since 2016, I think
[20:19:00] <spxtr> cool
[20:19:20] <rmmh> the thumbnails are ~4KB each, which is quite doable :)
[20:19:38] <catern> anyway the reason that is surprising to me is that I'd expect the most popular image to be something more unusual, like some image that was spammed a lot, or some image that's frequently used to start threads or serve some other procedural use
[20:19:47] <catern> not just some random popular meme
[20:20:14] <spxtr> I'm not surprised, pepe is basically on every thread somewhere
[20:21:16] <spxtr> (okay that's exaggerated but it certainly feels that way)

[20:23:02] <gwern> thumbs are probably pretty good for training the global/low-res part of a generative model. maximal diversity but still reasonable signal
[20:23:59] <rmmh> they're 125px, except for OPs which are 250px
[20:24:04] <PapuaHardyNet> "My friend Nate and I both live in each other’s heads, and we both furthermore have a vested interest in our mental clone copy. Nate wants my shoulder Nate to be as good of a Nate copy as it can be; I want the same for his mental Duncan. ...
[20:24:12] <PapuaHardyNet> In part, this is for weird TDT-esque considerations, but mostly, it’s just because I like my friend Nate, and he’s my friend at least in part because of the impact I have on him, and if he’s got a copy of me on his shoulder I can go on having that impact even when I’m not actually in the room."
[20:24:15] <rmmh> quality is rather bad though, they're at like jpg level 60
[20:24:56] <gwern> the fuzzy detail isn't too important. the upscaling layers will take care of that after training on fullres
[20:25:23] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: what the fuck?
[20:25:25] <gwern> (although you may have to create highly-compressed versions of the fullres ones in order to learn how to undo the JPEG artifacting)

[23:44:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> The other half of that is that maybe (in fact, likely) Eliezer thought "this will attract many [relative] MOPs, but this is the price I will pay for expanding the useful recruitment pool for people who can join me in my AI research basement"
[23:44:59] <mst> "the ender's game stuff" ?
[23:45:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> The part he didn't foresee is that the "excess" attracted-people were of such a sort and quality as ruined the community and generated/introduced memetic viruses that spread even to the (potentially) useful people
[23:46:26] <mst> hrm, is that in part 'insufficient banhammer' on the part of the LW admins?
[23:46:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (lol, they still haven't managed to turn off the Halloween stuff. amazing)
[23:47:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Partly but not entirely (though note that this is actually "insufficient [due to terrible ideology] banhammer"). The more important part is the Bay Area as a meatspace community attractor, for which we absolutely *can* blame Eliezer, who promoted that sort of thing strongly
[23:48:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: (plus geek social fallacies, of course, can't forget those)
[23:49:43] <adiabatty> why did he promote bezerkeley of all places
[23:54:43] <feepbot> <gwern> https://hsto.org/r/w1560/getpro/habr/upload_files/aab/68b/075/aab68b07591d7762ebe7d7b19aed3b70.png more dudall-e anime
[23:57:14] <saturn2> it seems like eliezer kind of assumed everyone who showed up would at least be an averagely competent self-sufficient adult, that there were no worse possibilities than that
