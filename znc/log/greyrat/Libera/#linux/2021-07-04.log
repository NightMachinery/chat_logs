[03:05:09] <ayecee> static code analysis is a pretty good start. it takes someone else's list of ways code can be unsafe, and checks for those things.
[03:05:52] <phogg> vitorgonc: so, first, pick *ONE* specific type of problem. Be as narrow and specific as you can. Then, read all of the code in the program. Or, read the code by following the path of execution for a particular run of the program. Keeping your specific problem in mind, ask yourself if it could occur as you reach each statement.

[03:12:11] <Dagmar> drew: Badblocks is no longer particualrly relevant on modern drives
[03:12:19] <Dagmar> Use the smart long test.
[03:12:27] <phogg> I've met some Java programmers from the "no crash must mean it works" school, and they tend to believe that Main() { try{ ... } catch { } } is the solution to robustness.

[08:09:39] <HumbleGuy> Why sometimes when i hit tab, it autocompletes to an non-existent file, for eg /etc/host instead of /etc/hosts, host file does not exist, then why it autocompletes to that? This is not the only case i found, there are several more "ghost" files like that.
[08:09:52] <Nosrep> try hitting tab again
[08:10:03] <Nosrep> sometimes it completes partially if there's multiple files that start the same way

[10:23:24] <Sauvin> Why is fragmentation a fear?
[10:23:31] <twainwek> i think sqlite does some interesting things behind the scene. that's why it's so slow to create tables
[10:23:55] <sumthing1980> yea this is too bothersome, Ill do my thing and see if defrag is needed in the future
[10:24:21] <Sauvin> Thinking not. I remember reading somewhere that most Linux-native FS fragment about 2.5%.
[10:24:29] <twainwek> if you're worried about performance due to db size, probably sqlite is not the right tool for you

[10:24:53] <sumthing1980> yea ok
[10:24:56] <twainwek> plus if you're using ssds you don't even need to worry about things like that
[10:24:58] <sumthing1980> thanks
[10:24:58] <Sauvin> Dunno. SQLite swallowed some monsters for me.

[10:25:11] <sumthing1980> ssds are random access right
[10:25:25] <twainwek> i think there are a few gotchas, but effectively yes
[10:25:34] <sumthing1980> ok
[10:25:41] <sumthing1980> it is a problem for another day
[10:25:43] <sumthing1980> thanks all bye
[10:26:18] <twainwek> another thing i don't understand is keyboard backlights
[10:26:23] <twainwek> or even worse, rgb keyboards
[10:26:46] <Sauvin> Never seen an "rgb keyboard".
[10:27:00] <twainwek> i mean if it was 1973, i'd understand as people would need to look at the keyboard to see where the keys are. but no one looks at keyboards to type anymore
[10:27:33] <akik> what the hell does the year have to do with anything?
[10:27:55] <twainwek> because back in 1973 not everyone had a computer and a smartphone
[10:28:02] <twainwek> it was only 3 years since unix epoch
[10:28:12] <TJ-> sumthing1980: can't you just call VACUUM sometimes ?

[16:54:38] <Helmholtz1> so it can't be live
[16:54:55] <phogg> it depends on how it works. You have to make some choices
[16:55:24] <phogg> if there was a simple, obviously-correct answer then a tool for charting would probably have been standardized in the 80s

[16:58:56] <phogg> everything is a file, a pipe is a file where you can't seek (so is a socket)

[23:02:55] <akk> bewees: Depends on the project, but in general, unfortunately you can't count on make to figure it out.
[23:03:31] <firepup> may as well run make clean then recompile to be safe

[23:10:46] <dragonmaster> there are a number of reasons why a VM would not reply to pings, though, so looking at the NICs is probably better

[23:11:08] <bewees> akk: that's doable, with gentoo -stable, provided things don't break too much requiring you to recompile. But I think if ./configure is giving out no errors, make most likely will not run into errors
