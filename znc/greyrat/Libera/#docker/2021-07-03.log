On both nodes I get a 301 redirect to https which is fine but on the node1 I get a 404 after it, from traefik and on node2 a timeout. Both are logged in traefik coming in from ingress

[17:47:49] <OnkelTem> Actually I find out the reason. It was missing 'nat' table. And that - beacause of OpenVZ

[23:39:03] <dostoyevsky2> tabakhase: Yeah, my strategy is to actually use a managed k8s created from a docker container, where I can host a private docker instance...  which also doesn't require privileged containers
[23:40:21] <dostoyevsky2> so the container will create an adhoc k8s cluster, install a private docker registry and then start the new container in that cluster
[23:40:52] <dostoyevsky2> (This is also a CI process, so the k8s cluster will exists like 30mins max)
[23:42:39] <artok> wouldn't it be faster to keep k8s cluster idling?
[23:45:33] *** Joins: Geo (vanosg@user/geo/x-2246923)
[23:47:41] <dostoyevsky2> artok: Some of our CI might have 100s of docker containers (test cases), some 1000s...  if you use an adhoc cluster you can decide how long it would take... also easy to parallelize multiple CI pipelines, as they'd just spawn multiple ad-hoc k8s clusters... Keeping k8s clusters around is a bad smell imho, they should be treated like a epheremal container themselves... Also makes it a lot easier to 
[23:47:48] <dostoyevsky2> work with a fast moving project like k8s .  When you want to integrate a new version, you simply can spin up some CI pipelines with the new version, if it doesn't work, you just keep using the old version
[23:48:32] <Geo> hi, i'm having trouble connecting from container to container. i have two docker-compose files that I want services to talk between- what hostname should I use to talk to a service in docker-compose? If I'm reading the docs correctly, I don't need to specify a network for them...

[23:50:33] <artok> Geo: you need to have both on same network

[23:51:28] <artok> from same service stack, just the service name resolves to container ip
[23:52:00] <Geo> ok, and I believe using two docker-compose files means different service stacks (right?) so what do I use there?
[23:54:36] <artok> you can have both on same stack as you can run them on same docker compose command
[23:54:58] <artok> or have them on same namespace with commandline flag
[23:55:45] <Geo> what makes them 'on the same stack' ?
