[00:06:31] <clason[m]> And I'm telling you that you've consistently been wrong about this, and seem to prefer deflection to learning.
[00:06:48] <mjlbach[m]> sean probably has not reviewed your previous PR because he's busy, as simple as that
[00:07:15] <mjlbach[m]> Sometimes things go on the backburner, that doesn't mean the process is broken
[00:08:38] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: you seem to be too rigid about this whole thing that you're ignoring all the points I'm trying to make, so yeah this cuts both ways

[00:11:16] <kylo252[m]> it's not productive to try splitting hair at this point, it was just a suggestion either way
[00:15:24] <kylo252[m]> some thoughts: 
[00:15:24] <kylo252[m]> - any of those big patches should be agreed upon and completed in the shortest amount of time possible after that, since trying to rebase them is a total nightmare. 
[00:15:24] <kylo252[m]> - we probably need at least 2 reviewers per set for each of these, since it's easy to miss stuff when a change is this big
[00:15:24] <kylo252[m]> - need to decide on formatting changes during the patches (uncrustify vs clint.py) basically 
[00:18:39] <clason[m]> _or_ -- and bear with me here -- "we" should keep doing what is clearly working, until Bram has finished converting the whole code to Vim9 and the endeavour becomes moot.
[00:19:04] <kylo252[m]> define "clearly working" 
[00:19:28] <kylo252[m]> not saying it's broken, I just want to know what the bar is

[00:26:14] <clason[m]> That's halfway there, at least.
[00:28:01] <kylo252[m]> is there some plan to move all the fileio to using libuv if Bram keeps adding more vim9 specific fixes?  
[00:28:07] <kylo252[m]> is that even viable? 
[00:28:39] <clason[m]> We'll cross that bridge when we get there 
[00:29:08] <kylo252[m]> but generally, do you think that libuv can fully support windows for example?
[00:29:58] <clason[m]> You'll have to ask the LibUV people
[00:30:12] <clason[m]> Personally, I have zero interest in Windows
[00:30:42] <clason[m]> If it dropped from our support matrix, I'd be a happy potato.
[00:32:40] <kylo252[m]> would be interesting/scary(?) to see what kind of backlash if neovim 0.9 would stop supporting windows 👀
[00:33:09] <clason[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[05:06:32] <Daemoen> hey folks, are there any good guides on how to build a treesitter config for a language ?
[05:06:46] <Daemoen> i want to add ansible support, but no idea where to even start honestly
[05:08:19] <sunjonSenghanBri> Daemoen:libera.chat: isn't it just yaml?
[05:08:50] <Daemoen> sunjonSenghanBri:common misconception, but no.  ansible is an amalgum of yaml + jinja in one
[05:09:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> well. I don't think there's a working jinja parser yet
[05:10:08] <Daemoen> there is already an ansible-language-server available, so i want to extend it so that there is better syntax highlighting (as seen on https://als.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
[05:10:09] <sunjonSenghanBri> so the theory would be yaml + jinja injection
[05:10:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> the reality would be yaml
[05:10:30] <sunjonSenghanBri> LSP != treesitter, it's irrelevant

[05:11:37] <sunjonSenghanBri> treesitter is its own entity
[05:11:42] <Daemoen> from what someone was explaining the other day (i didnt have a chance to stick around, unfortunately), there are some lsp's that do some sort of hinting that the parsers are supposed to be able to take advantage of
[05:11:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> there's no "full suite"
[05:12:03] <mjlbach[m]> probably me
[05:12:08] * Daemoen nods
[05:12:12] <mjlbach[m]> language servers expose semantic tokens, locations of things that can be highlighted

[05:12:43] <mjlbach[m]> I wouldn't work on this yourself, if you wait a few weeks it will all probably be done

[12:57:30] <BennyPowers[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright): do you mean that you think I shouldn't load them from txt files and define them inline instead?

[12:59:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> yep, you could do it other ways, but the table seems very straight forward
[13:00:34] <BennyPowers[m]> OP was I'd like the convenience of files tho 😆
[13:00:56] <BennyPowers[m]> so "don't want that feature" isn't helpful advice

[13:02:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can do that too; getting them into the table's on you though

[13:03:10] <sunjonSenghanBri> "no, there isn't"

[13:05:11] <sunjonSenghanBri> that particular one is figlet, why store the generated ascii at all?

[20:03:01] <Guest32> I would suggest building from scratch if you starting up DavidMilestone and use AstroVim config as reference for getting parts you like
[20:03:16] <DavidMilestone> Yep, I do have my old Vim config
[20:03:17] <Guest32> using config you don't understand well sucks
[20:03:53] <DavidMilestone> I thought I'd give Neovim a try, and learn it as well
[20:04:14] <clason[m]> you don't need to use AstroVim to use Neovim
[20:04:37] <clason[m]> in fact, I'd recommend starting without any such config
[20:04:42] <DavidMilestone> The colors looked cool lol
[20:04:44] <DavidMilestone> Sure
[20:04:54] <Guest32>  I am sort of beginner as well, but neovim + nvim-treesitter + nvim-lspconfig + nvim-tree-lua + lualine/lightline + telescope/fzf probably covers most of the things you need
[20:05:04] <DavidMilestone> Gitsigns?
[20:05:20] <Guest32> yeah sure if you need
[20:05:55] <DavidMilestone> Guest32, which font are you using?
[20:06:22] <Guest32> jetbrains mono at the moment, but tried most of the fonts, Hack is nice too

[20:07:58] <clason[m]> PSA: anything with "0.5" in the title is an instant red flag
[20:08:15] <clason[m]> Neovim is at 0.6.1, and there were breaking changes in the meantime.
