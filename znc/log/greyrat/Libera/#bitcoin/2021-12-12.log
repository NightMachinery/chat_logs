[00:54:18] <yanmaani> lol
[00:54:29] <Victorsueca> spynxic: the reason I see is that most altcoins are just Bitcoin spinoffs, some are scams, others are plain Bitcoin copies that don't add anything of value and others go a step further and instead of trying to compete with Bitcoin, they do something different for a different use case (like ethereum for example). So when traders try to determine the value of any altcoin, they end up taking into account many of the same things they used to value
[00:54:29] <Victorsueca> Bitcoin too. That's why one of the most popular ways to scam a lot of traders is to create an altcoin, claim it does a lot of things better than bitcoin, premine it to hell, run an IPO and then flip everything into the market and run away.

[01:01:45] <earnestly> The 51% attack is an information theoretic consequence, unless you break the universe, there is no 'solving' it in the sense of making such a thing impossible.  bitcoin's solution is incentive
[01:01:47] <spynxic> earnestly: for example Bitcoin uses lots of energy today because everyone is competing

[01:02:28] <Victorsueca> earnestly: yep, I would have expected that by now someone would have already been able to make something better than Bitcoin, but surprisingly, nobody has been able to, mostly because corporate interests always prevent them from being truly useful
[01:02:56] <spynxic> Programmatically speaking, it is a greedy algorithm

[08:10:37] <carlino3> hi
[08:11:18] <carlino3> what can cause that RPC method "listtransactions" returns a duplicated transaction with different hashes?
[08:11:34] <carlino3> one transacion is on the blockchain, the other is invalid, but i have a hash for it
[08:12:47] <carlino3> i'm calling listtransactions every 1 minute, the transaction that is invalid was returned only one time
[08:13:36] <carlino3> i guess it has something to do with multiple blocks found at the same time or similar?

[08:27:32] <carlino3> s17 what do you mean?
[08:27:41] <carlino3> the transactions have a slightly different amount
[08:28:06] <carlino3> ~20 sats of difference
[08:28:18] <carlino3> how do i check that? s17
[08:28:54] <carlino3> one of the tx hash is invalid,not in the blockchain

[08:45:39] <s17> If at least one input sequence is less than 0xFFFFFFFE, the transaction may be replaced by fee.
[08:45:59] <carlino3> both transactions have the same input
[08:46:09] <carlino3> they have ~20 minutes of difference
[08:46:19] <carlino3> and those ~20 sats of difference in amount
[08:46:39] <carlino3> i don't know if it was an intentionaly double spend attempt or something weird
[08:46:47] <carlino3> my customer says it comes from an exchange
[08:47:26] <carlino3> "Transaction invalid: some outputs that it attempts to spend have been already spent or are no longer valid."
[08:47:32] <carlino3> that says the block explorer
[08:49:20] <carlino3> anyway, my code waits for three confirmations before crediting balance to users, so this had no effect more than a never confirmed transaction. but i want to have an idea if this was intentional or not.

[20:48:57] <steerpike> wouldn't that take up more space on the blockchain?
[20:49:54] <steerpike> basically like tcp acknowledgements
[20:52:00] <yanmaani> steerpike: My idea is to have something like automatic timelock
[20:52:11] <yanmaani> if I send btc to address X, it works like normal
[20:52:24] <yanmaani> however, after 180 days, it becomes a 1-of-2 multisig
[20:52:32] <yanmaani> so I can 'claim' it, and transfer it to my own
[20:52:38] <yanmaani> or just wait half a year and do nothing
[20:52:57] <yanmaani> this also solves the problem of people sending e.g. BTC to LTC addresses, like that one poor guy on reddit
[20:53:28] <yanmaani> so if I get an airdrop, I can just wait half a year, ignore it, and then say it's not my money cos it's in a multisig
