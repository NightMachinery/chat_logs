[01:59:29] <kittonian> so i'm trying to figure out the best way to accomplish that while keeping everything as secure as possible
[01:59:35] <Apachez> why not letting the user run the analyze and send in the result to you?
[01:59:42] <Apachez> this way you never need any master key
[02:01:42] <kittonian> that's not the use-case

[02:03:23] <Apachez> <kittonian> i'm open to suggestions, but I need to be able to analyze and run reports on the users
[02:03:31] <Apachez> thats what you said a few minutes ago it were
[02:03:41] <Apachez> so what is your usecase then?
[02:03:51] <Apachez> you want to fool your customers that their data is protected while in fact it isnt?
[02:04:37] <kittonian> don't jump to that. no one is trying to fool anyone
[02:04:49] <kittonian> let's say I have a million users
[02:05:11] <kittonian> and I need to run a report to see how many of them are between the ages of 18-25 and who live in a certain part of the country

[02:06:02] <kittonian> the idea is that the master key (or a ton of individual keys) would be stored offline
[02:06:26] <kittonian> and only when the data needs to be accessed would the key be plugged in and used
[02:07:16] <kittonian> meanwhile, the users are as protected as possible because everything is encrypted per each user's key, which means if someone broke in and stole all the data, they couldn't do anything with it so it would be worthless
[02:07:29] <kittonian> at least that's the working theory/idea
[02:07:37] <kittonian> so I'm trying to explore how to accomplish something like that

[02:24:21] <kittonian> heh, no you're good
[02:24:24] <ghostbuster> so basically you want a system where the data is available to each user with their own key (stored where?) and also available to you on-demand (with some kind of offline storage of your master key except when you want to use it)
[02:24:36] <kittonian> correct
[02:24:56] <kittonian> each user's key would be stored on device
[02:24:59] <ghostbuster> can you just keep a copy of each of your users keys, and encrypt that database with your key?
[02:25:17] <kittonian> i was literally just thinking about that
[02:25:25] *** Parts: _mikey (~mikey@user/mikey/x-4335048) (WeeChat 3.4)
[02:25:41] <kittonian> it's not a bad idea, but i'm concerned when there's a mass amount of users where we need to run a report on whatever data
[02:26:14] <ghostbuster> keys are pretty small, i'm sure you can fit them all on a usb-stick even for a large number of users
[02:26:22] <kittonian> at that point the query would take forever because it would need to run one at a time across potentially millions of users, decrypting each record and then moving on to the next
[02:26:31] <kittonian> and that's where I'm getting a bit stuck
[02:27:29] <ghostbuster> well.. you'd need to decrypt each record either way, the only difference would be looking up each key
[02:27:33] <kittonian> plus there's going to be a system where a user can choose to share their data (or a subset thereof) with others
[02:27:47] <ghostbuster> what exactly is the threat model here/
[02:28:01] <ghostbuster> user leaving their device on the bus etc?
[02:28:01] <kittonian> it's a potentially huge security risk
[02:28:25] <ghostbuster> risk is not the same as threat though
[02:28:31] <kittonian> no, because if they left their device, or even if the app was reverse engineered, no one would be able to access the data
[02:28:46] <ghostbuster> you said the keys are stored on the device, right?
[02:28:52] <ghostbuster> alongside the encrypted data
[02:28:58] <kittonian> but when it comes to someone hacking the server and stealing all the data, I can't have a situation where they could use it or decrypt it

[02:29:19] <kittonian> yes, the data lives on a backend db
[02:30:03] <ghostbuster> so when the user wants to use the data, they retrieve it from the db using some other credential and decrypt it on their device

[04:51:33] <tomreyn> if you consider certifications to be a way for learning security you'll be disappointed. they're a piece of (sometimes just virtual) paper that proves that you have correctly memorized a certain amount of information to pass a test.
[04:53:16] <Hydragyrum> they're not a way to learn, they're a way to put stuff on a resume

[13:10:35] <comet23> thank you very much
[13:11:06] <B4ckBOne> netdiscover -r 192.168.222.0/24
[13:11:18] <B4ckBOne> Something like this .. maybe you need to specify the interface with -i too
[13:11:47] <comet23> i get that i could run it explicitly but i want to know from a standpoint where i'm new to the network and i don't know anything about it
[13:11:50] <B4ckBOne> It will show you a list of live ipv4 and mac adresses on that network range
[13:11:59] <comet23> i just typed netdiscover in the console and it started running automatically
[13:12:13] <B4ckBOne> that works too but it scans all ranges
[13:12:18] <B4ckBOne> Takes a bit longer
[13:12:30] <comet23> i think scanning all ranges is what i want

[13:46:48] <cvmn> taliban was a nice u.s. ally that opposed russia, china and iran.  it was a major strategical error for u.s.a. to fight taliban.  this is why iran happily supported u.s.a. against the taliban.

[14:35:36] <ajak> well, you can't make claims like that without statistics :)
[14:35:47] <ajak> or at least something more than an assertian
[14:36:09] <labrador> its a deduction ajak
[14:36:19] <ajak> ..from what?
[14:36:23] <labrador> deductions dont need statistics
[14:36:34] <ajak> yeah, they need to be proven
[14:36:56] <cvmn> ajak: we can.  statistics is not the only way.  one can make it axiomatically.

[18:24:20] <caveman> so what would you invest in?
[18:24:36] <dodo> tbh, i think your information of global communication without internet and without possible failure will be bigger than any crypto
[18:24:48] <dodo> system of information exchange
[18:24:59] <caveman> yes.  do you know what's the fundamental problem that we must solve?
[18:25:10] <dodo> sounds like magic to me
[18:25:18] <dodo> so, very advanced tech?
[18:25:19] <caveman> no.  bluetooth communication.
[18:25:25] <dodo> er
[18:25:35] <dodo> we'd have a global bluetooth network?

[18:26:03] *** Joins: NoelFlantier3 (~Hubert@static.238.157.9.5.clients.your-server.de)
[18:26:13] <caveman> yes.  made by people.  as people walk around with their bluetooth on, their phones talk.  it eventually spreads all over the place.  much like how we got covid19 from china.
[18:26:44] <caveman> you can turn your bluetooth on only when you buy something from a shop.  then that shop becomes like a super spreader.
[18:27:18] <dodo> that's all local communication though, not better than the internet in that regard
[18:27:32] <caveman> heard of delay tolerant networks used by cars to communicate accidents to other cars?  basically cars inform nearby ones until it reaches the furthest edge of the city
[18:28:02] <dodo> i mean, email is fault tolerant
[18:28:05] <caveman> it's not local.  it's global.  it will eventually reach the entire planet.
[18:28:08] <dodo> this doesn't sound new
[18:28:40] <dodo> and if you have enough infrastructure that everybody can use bluetooth, we could simply keep using the internet, no?
[18:30:17] <caveman> dodo: yes, but it will take weeks or months to get the page you want eventually.  internet needs infrastructure to work.
[18:30:40] <dodo> so does bluetooth
[18:30:49] <caveman> but you're missing the point.
[18:31:03] <dodo> the point being?
[18:31:15] <caveman> paying money may not need instant confirmation of the double spending problem.  i think we can have a system where the confirmation delays for weeks or months.
[18:31:54] <dodo> i think they kind of already have that
[18:32:22] <dodo> there are 2nd layer technologies, as far as i understand them only a local node needs to be connected to the network for that to work
[18:33:05] <dodo> so locally a mesh network should kind of work
[18:33:27] <caveman> name 1 tech.
[18:33:34] <dodo> lightning network
[18:33:34] *** Joins: ty3r0x (~ty3r0x@user/ty3r0x)
[18:34:10] <caveman> how does lightening network solve it?
[18:34:44] <dodo> i don't know enough about it to explain it, but as far as i understand it could be used to build something like this
[18:36:40] <caveman> i doubt.
[18:36:58] <dodo> cool
[18:37:00] <caveman> lightening allows one leg to go online, but there has to be internet.
[18:37:16] <dodo> that's what i said
[18:37:25] <dodo> so does your system. it's just slower
[18:37:25] <caveman> but with my approach, no leg goes online
[18:37:34] <dodo> yes, it does
[18:37:40] <dodo> your online is just a meshnet
[18:37:47] <caveman> if i pay you, i send you a message to your phone.  we're both offline.
[18:37:58] <dodo> that doesn't work though
[18:38:01] <caveman> then the information i gave you spreads in weeks or months all over the world.
[18:38:15] <dodo> you haven't solved double spending
[18:38:24] <caveman> yes, i'm coming to the fundamental question:
[18:38:37] <caveman>   Q1. can we make it such that double spending is not profitable?
[18:38:48] <caveman> e.g. freeze enough money for long enough time?
[18:39:33] <caveman> did you know that the fiat money is doing this?  they solve double spending in a delayed manner.

[18:40:07] <caveman> basically i give you a note, and you have no clue if it's real or fake.  but you know that it's most likely true since it's a bad idea for me to do it (e.g. law will chase me + fine me + etc).

[18:40:55] <caveman> why?
[18:41:12] <dodo> because.. it's physical? you can't give the same note to two people
[18:41:39] <caveman> that's only when you give real gold.  you can bite on it, test it, etc, to make sure it's real gold.

[18:41:47] <dodo> omg, why do you talk about double spend if you don't even understand this
[18:41:52] <caveman> but with fiat, i can duplicate same fiat money.  how would you know?
[18:41:53] <dodo> no, it's exactly the same with cash
