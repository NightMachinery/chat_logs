[00:09:25] <Grinnz> but they'r
[00:09:30] <Grinnz> they're commonly mentioned in old google results
[00:10:17] <Grinnz> h2xs is basically an XS tool that is also accidentally a minter, and module-starter is a modern minter for ancient installers
[00:10:26] <Grinnz> so you dont really need to worry about others if you use modern tools
[00:10:29] <Grinnz> about either*
[00:10:38] <leont> The XS tool part is the 80% of the functionality that no one uses anymore
[00:12:01] <pragma-> The brief history is concise and all on one page, unlike the Google results. I started to get overwhelmed with the Google results and wasn't sure which pages were outdated or opinionated.

[00:17:48] <Grinnz> it does a couple things in ways i don't prefer, which is mainly why i wrote starter
[00:17:56] <Grinnz> but it's fine
[00:18:21] <pragma-> I don't know enough about CPAN distributions to judge or opine.
[00:18:49] <Grinnz> it's on the author process side, the built distribution is fine
[00:19:38] <Grinnz> milla and minilla will regenerate local files whenever you do a dzil build, which is annoying when you or contributors are just trying to run tests
[00:20:20] <Grinnz> there was a command called regenerate introduced later that separates that problem, and i added an option to starter to use it, it's described in the dzil commands section

[00:58:13] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:00:48] <LeoNerd> I'm still not really sure what the "problem" is with MB. I've used it for every pureperl, XS, optional-XS, and crazier modules of mine. I use it recursively for modules that build those, often several times down. I have modules that split multiple .xs or even .c files. I have modules with multiple .xs based unit-tests even. They JustWork on every platform I throw them at - including Windows.
[01:01:04] <LeoNerd> MB has easily handled *every possible usecase* I have ever thought to throw at it
[01:01:50] <LeoNerd> If there is a "problem" with it, I don't really think I've encountered it. The worst thing *I* can think of that I have personally encountered, is that it doesn't really understand dependencies properly and so if I edit a .xsi or a .h file, it won't realise it has to rebuild the .xs file. But no biggie; I just remember to  ./Build clean && ./Build
[01:02:39] <xenu> if we're talking about the *build* part, all perl tools are terrible at building C code, detecting stuff blah blah
[01:03:08] <xenu> as for authoring, dzil is simply much more powerful

[01:06:37] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: i ran into some weird issue many years ago related to making the Alien::Build::Z3 and MB but i got around it with MBT i think it was.  been way way too long though.  that's really my only issue i've ever had with it.  though if i use dzil i just don't care either way
[01:06:51] <xenu> my wishlist: built-in ability to build c++ and objective-c code, configure-like options (detect if a library/header/function/cli switch exists), the ability to build code in arbitrary directories with arbitrary compiler options that don't have to be shared between all files

[01:07:11] <LeoNerd> "detect if library/header/function exists" - is what I use ExtUtils::CChecker for
[01:07:13] <leont> One of them is essentially a make-like engine in Perl, with some really fancy dynamic dependency management but kind of over-engineered.
[01:07:18] <LeoNerd> (having first written ExtUtils::CChecker ;) )
[01:07:22] <xenu> also ideally it should be some kind of DSL, something like Module::Install had
[01:07:40] <simcop2387> well, pretended to have
[01:07:42] <LeoNerd> Mmm.. yeah a DSL-type thing in the Build.PL might be nicer
[01:07:49] <leont> The other is an abstraction around build processes, that can either be run (a bit make-like), or be turned into Makefile (etc…)
[01:07:59] <LeoNerd> Hardly a game-changer though
[01:08:20] <leont> The problem with CChecker is that it's build on top of CBuilder, and CBuilder is the crappiest part of MB
[01:08:26] <LeoNerd> Yah
[01:08:31] <LeoNerd> But it's all I had to work with ;)
[01:08:39] <LeoNerd> Give me something nicer than CBuilder and I'll change it
[01:08:57] <simcop2387> leont: that sounds familiar and might have been something related to my old problem i ran into.

[06:51:15] <aghast> Q: Perl was the first language *for me* that allowed negative indexing of lists and arrays. Does anyone know where the idea came from? Is it a perl-ism, or a clever idea taken from some other language?
[06:51:50] <aghast> (I should say, "allowed negative indexing ... to be relative to the end")
[06:55:53] <simcop2387> aghast: not sure off hand but i'd guess AWK would be the place to look
[06:57:31] <aghast> simcop2387, IIRC, awk arrays are actually hashes.
[06:58:18] <simcop2387> not sure then, awk inspired a good bit of the quirks of early perl.  you *can* use negative indexes in C though it's not a good idea :)
[06:58:53] <aghast> heh. Actually I have used negative indexes in C, but not for the same purpose...
[06:58:57] <simcop2387> sed and awk inspired a lot but i don't think sed had anything like it either
[07:01:21] <simcop2387> eval1: @X=(1,2,3); print("D=",$X[-1]);
[07:01:22] <perlbot> simcop2387: D=

[07:01:32] <simcop2387> eval4: @X=(1,2,3); print("D=",$X[-1]);

[07:01:41] <perlbot> simcop2387: D=3
[07:01:46] <simcop2387> interesting it's a perl 5ism
[07:02:10] <aghast> Earliest article I found was from 98.
[07:02:12] <simcop2387> so 1994 era
[07:03:36] <simcop2387> no perl deltas that old from what i see
[07:04:32] <simcop2387> might be able to determine it in the source but i'm not sure there'd be much
[07:05:27] <aghast> 5.004 mentions negative subscripts as a going thing.
[07:05:49] <simcop2387> yea adding it to a new interface internally
[07:08:50] <aghast> 5.001 has this: "NETaa13423: the code to do negative list subscript in scalar context was missing"

[07:09:31] <aghast> And 5.000 has "    Negative array subscripts now count from the end of the array."
[07:09:42] <aghast> I was looking for "index" rather than "subscript."
[07:12:23] <simcop2387> that seems to be the only and first mention of it.  and was from before any real version control was used so any kind of changelog of when that was added is long lost
[07:12:50] <simcop2387> so someone might know but it's certainly not discoverable
[07:18:56] <aghast> Found a message from $Larry on c.l.p mentioning it in perl5 Alpha 5.
[07:19:12] <aghast> > There is at least one interesting change. Negative subscripts on
[07:19:12] <aghast> arrays and slices now return elements counting from the end instead
[07:19:12] <aghast> of the beginning. In other words, $foo[$#foo] can be written $foo[-1].

[15:10:40] <aquanight> 21:15:13/E2B50 < xenu> fun fact: compiler developers believe that according to the standard it's UB to have an object larger than PTRDIFF_MAX ## so some quick googling and I find it's because of the issue of subtracting pointers to different locations within the object
[15:11:13] <aquanight> I'm guessing they think that it has to be possible to subtract converted char* pointers within the same object and get a valid result.

[23:08:58] <ology> Bscan_: Why did you write yours? Dissatisfaction with other things?
[23:14:06] <Bscan_> Yes, there are two language servers already but they are both limited in applicability. Perl::LanguageServer for example doesn't work on windows and throws stability issues on Perl 5.22 and later. PLS is better, but doesn't work on workspaces or individual files (only folders). Neither of them can navigate to any dependencies, and I find
[23:14:07] <Bscan_> dependencies to be fairly important. I was also dissatisified with the Go To Definition, especially with large codebases. For example, in PLS, clicking on Foo::Bar->new() will show every use of new() across your code base, instead of the one from Foo::Bar.
[23:14:07] <Bscan_> I use the compiler itself via perl -c (and the B:: compiler backend, Sub::Util, symbol table inspection, etc) that seems to work much better and works across a wider variety of platforms and scenarios.

[23:27:20] <Bscan_> Yep, this is certainly true (and a problem for the other 2 Perl language servers as well). vscode has a nice mechanism for marking a workspace as "trusted". If you open a random file, it won't run any extensions until you say to trust this workspace
