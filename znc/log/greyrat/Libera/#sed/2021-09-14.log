[17:29:20] <hanif> i just stumbled upon something weird (in gnu sed), say my pattern space is `q` and my program is `s/q\|$/a/g`, why do i get `a` instead of `aa`?
[17:30:51] <Soliton> the complete input is matched.
[17:32:43] <hanif> i don't understand, what about the empty string after `q`? why doesn't `$` match that?
[17:33:19] <hanif> is there anywhere i can read more about this?
[17:35:35] <geirha> It's a GNUism, so you'd have to consult the GNU sed docs
[17:36:20] <geirha> if you really want the result to be aa, try with   's/q/a/g; s/$/a/'   which is posix
[17:39:47] <hanif> the docs don't really seem to explain this
[17:40:47] <Soliton> it's a corner case of the particular regex engine. i would just avoid such regex.
[17:41:01] <hanif> but i am glad to have accidentally found this, it helped in a golf
[17:41:35] <hanif> 'i would just avoid such regex' yeah that's no option for code golf :)
[17:42:30] <Soliton> i'm sure you know that best practices have nothing to do with golfing.
[17:42:59] <Soliton> # sed -E 's/(^|,|$)/|&/g' <<< ,,,
[17:43:00] <shbot> Soliton: |,|,|,
[17:43:12] <Soliton> it's also not symmetric to ^.
[17:44:54] <Soliton> compare to what perl does for example.
[17:45:06] <hanif> # sed -E 's/(^|,|$)/&|/g' <<< ,,, # seems symmetric?
[17:45:08] <shbot> hanif: ,|,|,|
[17:45:36] <Soliton> the point is that ^ matches but $ does not.
[17:46:51] <hanif> # sed -E 's/(^|,|$)/<&>/g' <<< ,,, 
[17:46:52] <shbot> hanif: <,><,><,>
[17:46:57] <hanif> only , seems to match?
[17:47:40] <Soliton> yeah, sorry i mixed that up.
[17:49:42] <Soliton> # sed -E 's/(|)/<&>/g' <<< ,,,
[17:49:44] <shbot> Soliton: <>,<>,<>,<>
[17:50:08] <Soliton> so the empty string between characters matching is consistent but different to how perl for example does it.
[17:50:30] <Soliton> and unexpected if you combine with matching characters.
[17:52:12] <Soliton> doesn't concern standard sed though if -E is added to POSIX it probably does...
[17:53:12] <Soliton> perhaps the ERE specification already says something about it.
[17:54:53] <hanif> yeah my bsd sed -E behaves similarly on s/q|$/a/g as does gnu sed
[17:57:55] *** Joins: danisztl1 (~weechat@user/danisztls)
[17:59:31] <Soliton> maybe it's because in sed an empty regex is short hand for repeating the last regex not for actual matching. so the notion of what an empty regex matches was not considered...
[18:01:30] <Soliton> doesn't seem to be mentioned in ERE POSIX spec so at most you'll find it in the documentation of your specific implementation. i don't think it's in the info doc of GNU sed either though.
[18:03:53] <hanif> that leaves source diving
