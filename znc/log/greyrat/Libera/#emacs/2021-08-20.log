[00:00:26] <twb> yabobay: it's how Debian standardized it, which was later adopted by GNU
[00:00:44] <yabobay> does it mean like, release candidate?
[00:00:50] <twb> That's the intended use case, yes
[00:01:07] <yabobay> i can't think of a situation where that would inconvenience me, so i guess it's fine 
[00:01:26] <twb> yabobay: right.  Just mentioning it NOW, rather than 2 weeks from now after it's too late
[00:01:41] <yabobay> (also imagine not using the gnu coreutils)
[00:02:01] <twb> yabobay: you've never used MacOS or Android or Windows or Alpine?
[00:02:09] <twb> yabobay: all of those are non-GNU unixes
[00:02:21] <gabin> O.O
[00:02:30] <yabobay> windows is a great unix 
[00:02:53] <twb> alpine does have ls -v thourhg
[00:03:21] <twb> because it's userland, busybox, was originally written for Debian :-)
[00:03:28] <yabobay> i mean, i have used those as well as BSD on occasion, but i'd assume that there's a way to install the better coreutils, i'd probably look into it if i was using one of these as a daily driver
[00:04:05] <gabin> til linux and windows are unix

[03:28:28] <parsnip> > Some IMAP-synchronization programs such as mbsync (but not offlineimap) don’t like it when message files do not change their names when they are moved to different folders. mu4e can attempt to help with this - you can set the variable mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving to non-nil.

[14:18:23] <twb> What you want is a "terminal emulator", which is a way text programs can talk to a screen and keyboard.  Inside that, you run a "shell", which is a program that manages starting and stopping other programs.

[14:18:59] <twb> razzy: Emacs has several.  M-x shell RET will run a "dumb" terminal, and in that typically run the shell "bash".

[18:57:13] <wasamasa> lol
[18:57:28] <xheimlich> there's like a sequence of steps that looks one way at training time and another at prediction. there's no easy "internal" way to convert from one to the other.
[18:57:31] <wasamasa> as long as you don't want to write the parser for yaml
[18:57:33] <grym> xheimlich: well, here's some frontloaded pain: https://noyaml.com/

[18:59:19] <grym> just know that yaml comes with lots of gun/foot confusions
[18:59:36] <xheimlich> ML pipeline.
[18:59:48] <xheimlich> Happens at two moments: training time and prediction time.
[18:59:57] <grym> what happens

[19:00:29] <xheimlich> but at training time I want to *fit* those models and *serialize* to disk, preferrably with some metadata json file or whatever already.
[19:00:45] <xheimlich> and at prediction time I want to *load* from disk and read said metadata to know how to use yadda yadda.
[19:00:57] <wasamasa> serialize/unserialize is done with json
[19:01:05] <wasamasa> yaml is not a serialization format
[19:01:09] <grym> sure it is 
[19:01:11] <xheimlich> seems cleaner to describe model and metadata and pipeline order in some slightly more abstract notation.
[19:01:13] <wasamasa> using it as a json superset is a really bad idea
[19:01:18] <xheimlich> I'm serializing to binaries, that's not it.
[19:01:18] <grym> that is also true

[19:03:14] <grym> yeah.  speaking from experience, every shitty gh repo full of ML stuff that i've used that has used yaml as a serialization/coodination format has made me murderously angry 
[19:03:47] <grym> the half-life of "you know, just *one* ndarray won't hurt anyone if i put it in the yaml!" is about a week

[19:04:26] <grym> it's an ugly corner and i don't know what the right spackle is to hide that
[19:04:27] <wasamasa> yeah, but one of the links reminded me relying on s-expressions for portability between lisps is also a bad idea
[19:04:33] <xheimlich> I hate to use the devops-y word, but this would be for "orchestration". objects are serialized to disk in some opaque format and that's okay, if pickle file format rot happens we can re-run the training pipeline, it's reproducible.
[19:04:40] <twb> I'm honestly reaching the point of just going "you know what, fuckers?  Our data interchange formate is sqlite databases"
[19:04:49] <grym> pickle is objectively worse than yaml 
[19:04:50] <grym> in every way 
[19:04:57] <grym> it's a huge wart on sklearn
[19:05:02] <twb> yes pickle is the worst
[19:05:03] <xheimlich> yeah. but pickle is just a detail.
[19:05:10] <grym> ... until it detonates :) 
[19:05:10] <twb> pickle can't even share data btween different python versions
[19:05:13] *** Joins: razzy (~razzy@user/razzy)
[19:05:18] <twb> and it is full of security issues
[19:05:20] <wasamasa> pickle's code execution is the pickle on top
[19:05:20] <grym> twb: yes, it can.  _sometimes_
[19:05:23] <twb> it's basically eval()
[19:05:26] <grym> it's literally eval 
[19:05:31] <grym> but, uh, well, sexps
[19:05:34] <grym> so w/e
[19:05:38] <wasamasa> it's a time-honored practice to exploit pickle in a CTF
[19:05:42] <xheimlich> exactly. but it doesn't matter since I can recreate models given a clean model fitting routine and training data snapshots.
[19:05:48] <grym> wasamasa: as is right and proper!
[19:05:49] <twb> grym: well... binary eval
[19:05:57] <twb> grym: so I guess it's bytecode eval :-)
[19:05:59] <wasamasa> I have avoided doing that though
[19:06:21] <xheimlich> I just need a sliiightly more abstract and cleaner notation to keep all the metadata stuff together.
[19:06:22] <twb> xheimlich: are you... talking about prostitution now?
[19:06:23] <grym> pickle has exactly one acceptable use, which is "here hold onto this i'll need it before program execution finishes *this time*"
[19:06:27] <grym> and even then there are caveats

[19:07:05] <wasamasa> ouch: https://matrix.yaml.io/valid.html
[19:07:26] <twb> grym: so I guess what you're saying is pickle is a workaround for python's lack of call/cc ^_^
[19:07:36] <xheimlich> grym: every ML model has some internal state that can be stored in some cleaner fashion. In the limit a linear regression is just a bunch of coefficients. 
[19:07:41] <grym> twb: it's still serialization to disk, you just can't trust it to live longer than one execution. 
[19:07:49] <grym> xheimlich: yes, i know

[19:08:05] <twb> I wish machine learning people would stop talking about ML like it's something other than the Haskell before Haskell
[19:08:07] <xheimlich> but what the sklearn approach buys is a generic way to do things. problem 1 is not enough metadata.

[19:08:29] <grym> (i would not)
[19:08:37] <xheimlich> so pickle files bit rot like crazy. and if you're trying to do monthly upgrades etc. you need to point to data snapshots.
[19:08:38] <twb> grym: I don't have a good answer
[19:08:43] <twb> grym: but it causes me confusion EVERY TIME
[19:08:53] <grym> twb: 'mailing list' is the one that gets me 
[19:08:56] <twb> "oh someone is talking about ML, I wonder if it's smlnj or ocaml"
[19:09:05] <wasamasa> I do wonder whether it was a mistake for python to become this popular
[19:09:13] <twb> "oh wait it's that fucking stuff casinos invented to ban people who win"
[19:09:17] <xheimlich> problem 1 is not enough metadata. problem 2 is - the sklearn pipeline functionality is much much better than in 2019 but it still doesn't fit my use case.
[19:09:18] <grym> wasamasa: blame dabeaz :D 
[19:09:36] <wasamasa> but then, I doubt it would have been better for ruby to win
[19:09:41] <wasamasa> I hate other people's ruby code
[19:09:47] <wasamasa> and treat it like perl++
[19:09:52] <xheimlich> wasamasa: from where I stand, Python was there when people started fleeing Matlab.
[19:10:00] <twb> wasamasa: there's two kinds of per
[19:10:02] <grym> there are entire spheres of python influence i don't know anything about 
[19:10:08] <twb> wasamasa: there's perl written by C refugees in the 1990s
[19:10:11] <grym> and yes, python is the exit ramp from natick, MA
[19:10:20] <grym> for many of us 
[19:10:22] <twb> wasamasa: and there's bonker OO perl written by people who somehow never saw ruby or python
[19:10:29] <xheimlich> I even consulted for a seed-stage startup and made matlab models for them which they ran in octave, very slowly.
[19:10:49] <grym> so all this webdev/perl-replacement ops / ... stuff?  i haven't the first clue about any of it and kind of don't care 
[19:11:20] <xheimlich> grym: the 2/3 split reveals some of those spheres.
[19:11:34] <xheimlich> python2 was apparently more of a scripting language. 
[19:11:35] <grym> what i care about is not having to use matlab but getting figures and plots anyway :) 
[19:11:43] <grym> i think "scripting language" is a silly idea

[19:12:47] <xheimlich> I don't know Java, but Python seems considerably easier to learn.
[19:13:08] <twb> xheimlich: it's easy to learn because it's just like languages "everyone" already knows

[23:56:22] <Bayes> dear wonderful people, in auctex or in general how to I move the beginning of the line one tab to the left? e.g., a line has 3 tabs and I want to move it left one to get it aligned to 2 tabs only

[23:57:14] <bpalmer> Bayes: if you're using actual tab characters, make sure backspace is bound to backward-delete-char , not backward-delete-char-untabify
[23:57:33] <bpalmer> (the latter will, if you backspace over a tab character, replace it with spaces, and then delete one of those spaces)
[23:57:56] <Bayes> oh untabify seems like a good keyword, didn't know that term every existed but that's what I want to do. To untabify one tab to the left
[23:58:08] <bpalmer> Bayes: indentation in emacs typically works, however, by indenting based on the context (the syntactic properties of the language, how much the previous line was indented by)

[23:58:22] <bpalmer> Bayes: no, it sounds like you want to delete an entire tab.
[23:58:31] <oats> a part of the new infrastructure proposal in the US could bring amtrak service increases in Indiana.
[23:58:38] <bpalmer> untabify is the process of converting tab characters to spaces; tabify is the process of converting spaces to tab characters.
[23:58:57] <oats> right now there's a Chicago<->Indy<->Cincinnati route, but it runs 3x a week at really inconvenient times
[23:59:03] <Bayes> ah ok so I want to bind backspace to backward-delete-char
[23:59:12] <oats> Amtrak proposal would make it faster and make it 4x per day
[23:59:18] <oats> wich would be absolutely incredibly
[23:59:27] <oats> *le
[23:59:36] <oats> I could reasonably use a train to go home
