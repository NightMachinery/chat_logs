[00:04:38] <dila> tempate: how is the degree of a monomial defined? what is the degree of x^d*y^d in R[x,y]?
[00:05:16] <Z-module> a totally general monomial in R[x,y] is   r x^b y^c   where b,c are nonnegative integers, r is real.  If r != 0, its degree is b + c
[00:05:22] <somiaj> in a multivariable polynoial it would be the sum of the powers
[00:05:32] <joel135> here, the degree is taken with respect to the last variable
[00:05:44] <dila> ah, differing conventions
[00:06:03] <qergle> it's not that uncommon, it's an "algebraic form"
[00:06:14] <Z-module> well, each poly in R[x,y] *can* be expressed as an element of  S[y]  where S is the ring R[x]
[00:06:21] <Z-module> so you can talk about its degree as a poly over y
[00:06:26] <Z-module> in y, rather
[00:07:24] <joel135> (err, somiaj's answer is also right)
[00:07:35] <qergle> your book is using form and homogeneous poly synonymously, which isn't universal
[00:07:43] <Z-module> most of the time, the degree of a monomial is taken to be the sum of the powers
[00:07:50] <qergle> often people make distinctions between a polynomial and its induced function
[00:08:06] <dila> Z-module: but equally you could express it as S[x] where S is the ring R[y], i suppose? so there is some ambiguity?
[00:08:29] <Z-module> and then the degree of a general poly in R[x_1,...,x_n] is the highest degree of any monomial in it
[00:08:48] <somiaj> dila: it depends on how you want to view it, as a multivariable poly, or a single variable poly, which may depend on context.
[00:08:50] <Z-module> dila, you can, yes
[00:09:10] <Z-module> typically you're only viewing it as a poly in one variable during induction proofs

[00:09:35] <dila> i mean you can just swap the interpretations of x and y, but for a given expression, say x*y^2, that would change the function definition
[00:11:35] <dila> but isn't it possible to map R[x,y] to R[u] and then introduce functions f_x(u) and f_y(u) to "extract" the monomials in the subscript?
[00:11:57] <Z-module> not in a nice way
[00:12:06] <Z-module> that is, not without killing ring homomorphisms left and right
[00:12:42] <Z-module> but sure, you can fix a bijection N x N -> N  and do a re-encoding as you indicated

[00:35:53] <vckt> so since its established through this that inf(A) + inf(B) is a lower bound of A+B, we just need to show that it is the greatest lower bound
[00:36:03] <qergle> vckt: things often don't feel elementary when you're seeing them for teh first time

[00:37:35] <qergle> yes, inf(A)+inf(B) ≤ a+b for a ∈ A, b ∈ B.
[00:38:36] <mawk> it's just a matter of adding up the inequalities no?
[00:38:40] <mawk> and that's always allowed
[00:38:54] <vckt> hmm which ones do you mean
[00:39:00] <mawk> inf(A) <= a and inf(B) <= b
[00:39:18] <mawk> yeah ok you already proved that, nevermind

[00:41:22] <qergle> you can, but why? this is an important part of that side of the argument.
[00:41:42] <qergle> why can you go inf(A)+inf(B) ≤ a+b ⇒ inf(A)+inf(B) ≤ inf(A+B)?
[00:41:42] <vckt> hmm
[00:42:59] <riv> Let x be a lower bound of A+B, show that x <= inf A + inf B
[00:43:24] <riv> use the fact that there exist sequences (a_n) and (b_n) that tend to inf A and inf B

[00:46:30] *** Quits: tempate (~alpha@user/tempate) (Quit: Leaving.)
[00:47:38] <qergle> vckt: ok. maybe think of it this way. is inf(A)+inf(B) a lower bound for A+B?
[00:47:47] <vckt> yeah
[00:48:10] <qergle> well, show it, but if you know that then surely inf(A+B) is at least as big as it (since it's the greatest lower bound)
[00:48:37] <qergle> so all you need is that inf(A)+inf(B) is a lower bound of A+B and then you have that inf(A)+inf(B) ≤ inf(A+B)
[00:48:58] <riv> So assume x > inf A + inf B
[00:49:24] <riv> at some point a_n + b_n <= x violates that, giving a contradiction
[00:49:33] <qergle> need to fill in a few details to show inf(A)+inf(B) is indeed a lower bound of A+B, but then you can move on to showing the flip side
[00:49:48] <qergle> namely that inf(A+B) ≤ inf(A)+inf(B)
[00:50:00] <riv> this gives you inf (A + B) <= inf A + inf B
[00:50:32] <qergle> once you've shown both inequalities hold, then equality holds.
[00:50:39] <qergle> that's the big picture. now go do it! :)
[00:51:04] <vckt> damn, thanks. ill attempt it and see what i get
[00:52:22] <riv> alternative approach: if we show (A + B)^bar = A^bar + B^bar then the infimums lie in the sets so we get inf (A + B) = inf A + inf B straight away

[01:21:30] <taiwanJizhan> In math and theoretical CS, we can refer the "Halting Problem" to be any "decision problem" that is reasoned/proved that: having no algorithm (finite steps of finite operations) can solve it. So the "Halting Problem" is called "undecidable".
[01:21:42] <taiwanJizhan> [QUESTION] Does there exist any other what I called the "Super Halting Problem", which is any "decision problem" that is reasoned/proved even that: it is impossible to <decide> whether or not any solving algorithm to the "Super Halting Problem" exists? So in this case the "Super Halting Problem" is even <undecidable> whether or not it is "undecidable".

[06:02:19] <nagefire> essentially my advisor is very good at combinatorial graph theory, but knows nothing about applications
[06:02:43] <nagefire> so he collaborated with physicists and quantum computing specialists
[06:03:05] <taiwanJizhan> wow
[06:03:40] <nagefire> He worked on what's called "perfect quantum state transfer"
[06:04:07] <nagefire> showing that we can transfer a quantum state from one part of a network to another
[06:04:19] <nagefire> with 100% probability
[06:04:44] <nagefire> Turns out that cospectrality is a sufficient condition for perfect transfer
[06:05:03] <nagefire> So now quantum computing specialistics can devise more accurate algorithms
[06:09:00] <taiwanJizhan> how do you decide what specialty in math you choose to focus on?

[10:36:08] <qergle> right, so you take a complete digraph, for every pair of vertexes pick one of the arcs and remove the other and you're left with a tournament.
[10:40:59] <qergle> a complete directed graph on n nodes has C(n,2) pairs of edges. A tournament can pick one from each pair meaning on n nodes you have 2^C(n,2) possible tournaments.
[10:43:30] <qergle> We found a hamiltonian path on your 4-node tournament. Now confirm the other 63 have one as well.

[16:21:58] <kobalt> hi, so I was trying to understand Dirac's Theorem in graph theory and have this basic doubt.
[16:23:33] <kobalt> here the author says that p1 and pk will have all neighbours in the path P https://i.imgur.com/eoRogro.png
[16:30:52] <twJizhan> can anyone talk with me with my thought experiment...?
[16:32:44] *** Joins: trace987 (~trace@ip5f5a6a70.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)

[16:42:54] <kobalt> second para is about the claim that there is a vertex j such that vk is adjacent to it and then v1 is adjacent to vk+1
[16:43:15] <int-e> Fine whatever, forget about paragraphs
[16:43:25] <int-e> your confusion should be fully resolved by the second sentence of the proof

[16:44:07] <int-e> (In conjunction with the first one which indeed makes an assumption about the path P)
[16:45:06] <int-e> There are some minor wrinkles in the english grammar (first sentence: "the" should be "a"; second sentence should use "were" instead of "is"), but nothing that obscures the proof.
[16:46:39] <kobalt> int-e: yes. actually my confusion arose when I thought about this type of graph https://share.sketchpad.app/21/366-5174-e74897.png In this type of graph not all neighbours of v1 and vk could be on P.
[16:47:44] <int-e> and the path you point out is not a longest path
[16:48:27] <int-e> So it doesn't correspond to what happens in the proof.

[17:10:15] <kobalt> I have seen some proofs that said to add the neighbour of v1 and vk to P if they are not already in P and then the new path will be longest path. But I missed the fact that when we do this we must then relabel the terminal vertex as v1 or vk
[17:10:55] <int-e> kobalt: In principle you could write a different proof that just starts with any path and keeps extending it until it becomes Hamiltonian. But... such a proof would have to deal with many different paths, whereas starting out with picking a longest path allows the whole proof to focus on that single path and a couple of hypothetical ones that would be longer (hence can't exist).

[22:00:15] <cuppajoeman> and intuitively the other one too
[22:00:34] <cuppajoeman> Is it the case that |lim x -> a f(x)| = lim x -> a |f(x)| ?
[22:00:52] <cuppajoeman> should be right, it's just mirrored?
[22:00:54] <Z-module> yes, the absolute value function is continuous everywhere
[22:01:15] <cuppajoeman> And you're using that fact how?
[22:01:28] *** Joins: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@101.89.207.55)
[22:02:13] <cuppajoeman> so you're writing, for any continuous function h, then we know that h(lim x-> a f(x)) = lim x -> a h(f(x))

[22:14:02] <jrm> Is this correct?  From a set of n elements, to calculate the number of all subsets, it's choose(n,0) + choose(n,1) + choose(n,2) + ... + choose(n,n).
[22:14:24] <Z-module> yes, which has a nice shortcut form
[22:14:37] <cuppajoeman> 2 ^n
[22:14:42] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: that is not what you wrote, and that would only be equal to h(f(a)) if f was continous, which wasn't in your statement (that I saw)
[22:14:59] <cuppajoeman> jrm, you can proof the number of subsets using induction
[22:15:06] *** Quits: vckt (~vkt____@103.252.171.180) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:15:07] <somiaj> though I guess in this case you only need h(f(x)) to be continous and not f(x) itself.
[22:15:19] <cherim> The main restriction in that formula comes from the fact that lim x-> a f(x)  in LHS must exist (otherwise there is no claim)
[22:15:46] <cherim> It already makes f almost continuous (up to a redifinition of f(a))
[22:16:04] <cuppajoeman> jrm: Or you can use the binmial theorem (x + y) ^n with x = y = 1
[22:16:10] <jrm> It's just a general curiosity.  The OS packing system that I work on has options.  I'm curious about the total number of ways to test the package, e.g., with all options off, option 1 and 3 on, all options on, etc.
[22:16:47] <cuppajoeman> For each optiion it's either there or it isn't
[22:16:49] <cuppajoeman> 2 ^ n
[22:16:54] <jrm> cuppajoeman: Yes
[22:17:02] <somiaj> jrm: If you just think of say having n-options, you have a bitstring of length n, which is just n 0's or 1's.
[22:17:23] <cuppajoeman> Is there a name for this composition rule?
[22:17:28] <somiaj> jrm: the number of cases for each position (or option) is 2, and so there are 2*2*2*...*2 = 2^n possible ways to choose which options are on/off
[22:17:40] <cuppajoeman> trying to find the correct statement
[22:18:28] <cherim> lim x->a f(x) =f(a) is a variant of the definition of continuity (sequential continuity)

[22:24:04] <cherim> You have f(x)<=g(x)<=h(x) with lim x->a f(x) = lim x-> a h(x) = L, then always lim x-> a g(x) = L
[22:25:04] <cherim> Or just do an mental epsilon-delta for the upper bound on coordinate norm (lower bound is trivial by >=0)
[22:26:04] <cuppajoeman> jrm: say your prog takes flags x1  ... xn and flag xi cannot appear when any of x_a1 x_a2 ... x_aj are presentthen you can consider the set of flags x_i with all the x_a's removed and do the computation we discussed, then you can remove x_i and then do it with all other flags including the x_a's
[22:26:17] <cuppajoeman> cherim: I think that's exactly what the proof was?
[22:27:18] <cherim> Where do compositions of continuous functions are appearing here?
[22:27:23] <cuppajoeman> we end up with |f_i(x) - L_i | < = || f(x)  - L  ||
[22:28:05] <cuppajoeman> SO then we know that lim x -> |f_i(x) - L_i| <= lim x -> a ||f(x) - L || = 0
[22:28:29] <cherim> 0<= |f_i(x) - L_i | < = || f(x)  - L  ||, leftmost and rightmost have limit 0, middle will also have limit 0
[22:28:38] <dila> cuppajoeman: all of the flags could be independent except for a single case of a whole flag vector which is handled specially
[22:28:41] <cuppajoeman> and then lim x -> a |f_i(x) - L_i | = | lim x -> a f_i(x) - L_i | >= 0
[22:28:50] <cherim> No need for any continuity even
[22:29:05] <cuppajoeman> How do you know lim x -> a |m(x) | >= 0
[22:29:22] <cuppajoeman> because lim x -> a | m(x) | = |lim x > a m(x) | >= 0
[22:29:29] <cuppajoeman> composition of continuous function
[22:29:34] <cuppajoeman> | x | is cont function
[22:29:45] <cuppajoeman> u see
[22:30:10] <cuppajoeman> maybe it's too much?
[22:30:20] <cherim> For the rightmost, it's what you are given in the definition of the limit in R^k
[22:30:34] <cherim> For the middle, it's the definition of the limit in R
[22:31:07] <cherim> But whatever goes if you have no more questions!
[22:31:38] <cuppajoeman> I think I understand I was just wanted to be sure that lim x -> a |m (x) | >= 0 (even though its obvious)

[23:43:11] <Z-module> looking
[23:45:08] <Z-module> it would help things if you avoid |M - L| and just use M - L , which is strictly positive by assumption.
[23:46:43] <Z-module> also, though it really doesn't matter, it's highly traditional and reader-expected in one-real-variable limits to have the x come from an *open* delta-interval, so use  |x - a| < delta   in there, rather than <= delta
