[01:11:36] <rascul> ddrescue or dd_rescue?

That is my thinking process. If I'm mistaken, you are

[04:25:59] <sysRPL> in my opinion a computer is meant to be programmed, be productive, and grant easy access to information
[04:26:38] <sysRPL> viewing a computer as a means to play game all day is fine, but you might as well buy a gaming console
[04:26:43] <sebastorama> yeah, in your opinion. In my opinion a computer needs to do that, and also run my flight simulator rig, can't do that on linux
[04:26:53] <sebastorama> and can't do that on a gaming console either
[04:27:08] <rasta> sebastorama actually you can
[04:27:34] <rasta> but as flight simulator is from microsoft it may fail, but you can run windows programs on linux
[04:27:36] <sebastorama> you can, providing you don't use any high fidelity aircraft

[04:28:28] <TudbuTD> Hey, does anyone know why libicu is causing so many packages to break when updating? I use arch Linux, and some packages require older libicu versions, but some require newer ones. Is there any way I can install both (there don't seem to be conflicting files. One version has libicu.so.69 and one libicu.so.70. Any ideas?
[04:28:30] <rascul> also it might should be '%{pts:hms}'   (without the \)
[04:29:01] <sebastorama> once you start using software like PMDG / FSLabs etc, there's no going around windows, also a ton of custom hardware etc.. It's not linux fault of course, it's just status quo... But I also love linux for the rest of my computer life
[04:29:29] <rasta> i think thats why the OS must be open source
[04:30:21] *** rasta is now known as felco
[04:30:41] <rascul> sebastorama i don't do the flight simulator thing but i've seen some crazy setups
[04:30:49] <yBtNJW3j> I agree that a computer should be programmable, but one should not have to reprogram an entire system like linux/gnu just to use basic software.
[04:30:56] <sebastorama> whatever... Not really a big deal for me to dual boot. Actually, my simulator machine is dedicated anyways
[04:31:05] <Nobrem> rascul, this changes something.... something weird... but a step in a good way

[05:36:43] <jensen> ok, i'm asking because i'm trying to decide whether to specify full path to user script for systemd directive or to use `bash <script>` so I don't have to use full path which allows for some flexibility.

[05:54:21] <DynV> I'm not interested in embedded or server versions.
[05:54:43] <sheep> it doesn't need a GNU userland to be Linux. Otherwise distros that use busybox with musl or uClibc don't count

[07:11:18] <celphi> so i need to disable in CMOS?
[07:11:26] <Dagmar> It's the kernel saying "THAT NVIDIA MODULE LOOKS SHIFTY AND WEIRD AND I WON'T LOAD IT."
[07:11:39] <Dagmar> This is trivial to turn off.
[07:11:58] <celphi> nvidia made cuda
[07:12:20] <celphi> so i dont get why it would be a problem
[07:12:22] <rascul> apparently nvidia didn't sign the drivers with somehting your kernel likes

[07:15:05] <r3m> sorry
[07:15:14] <Dagmar> celphi: Okay perhaps not "trivial" but basically you need to con the kernel into trusting the nvidia module so it can be loaded.  See also this https://askubuntu.com/questions/1023036/how-to-install-nvidia-driver-with-secure-boot-enabled

[07:15:45] <rascul> i guess another option is to not use secure boot
[07:15:55] <Dagmar> Nah that's not really needed.
[07:15:59] * rbox securtly attaches his boots
[07:16:06] <Dagmar> Either method will work, but signing the thing is a bit less draconian
[07:16:11] <rascul> signing the module seems like the best option
[07:16:44] <rascul> i suspect this wouldn't be an issue if it was installed from debian's packages instead of nvidia's
[07:17:14] <rascul> debian is usually pretty good at making sure software in debian's repos work properly
[07:17:20] <celphi> so im totally willing to try that - but will it break if i try to follow those steps now?
[07:17:21] <Dagmar> THat _should_ have been the first method of installation
[07:17:40] <celphi> or do i need to somehow undo what i did in steps 1=7
[07:17:43] <rascul> it won't break if you undo your $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH changes
[07:17:58] <celphi> if i reboot that would undo it right?
[07:18:01] <Dagmar> No neither of those will cause persistent problems
[07:18:11] <Dagmar> Rebooting it will unfo anything you shoved into /proc tho
[07:18:30] <rascul> if you made those changes into a file that you saved which is read on shell startup, rebooting will not undo it
[07:18:35] <Dagmar> If you sign the module, stick those commands into a script because you'll need to do that every time you update the nvidia kernel modules

[07:19:20] <rascul> problem with the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH changes is that if you followed the guide then you put them first, so the one you installed from nvidia will be the one used

[08:12:08] <Blondie101010> the .conf is *typically* used by package managers, and what you want to change should go in conf.d

[08:12:41] <Dagmar> I would suggest turning up verbosity with udevadm but that would be cruel
[08:12:51] <Dagmar> It generates hundreds of lines of output
[08:12:54] <celphi> `ssh myusername@xx.xxx.xxx.xxx`
[08:13:02] <Blondie101010> why hide your private IP?
[08:13:09] <celphi> it's public ip
[08:13:10] <Blondie101010> or even username
[08:13:22] <Blondie101010> you said it was on wifi
[08:13:29] <Dagmar> labrador: because the filenames are usually brought in in alphabetical order, so starting with numbers makes the load order obvious
[08:13:36] <Blondie101010> please explain how it gets a public IP over wifi
[08:13:39] <celphi> yes. but i thought 0.0.0.0 makes it public
[08:13:54] <Dagmar> celphi: no that just makes it bind to all available local interfaces
[08:13:56] <labrador> oh ok,I thought it was a required format or something.
[08:13:57] <labrador> Thanks
[08:14:13] <Dagmar> labrador: Well, it's required if you don't like clawing at the monitor and screaming incoherently
[08:14:20] <Blondie101010> celphi:  show: ip a
[08:14:20] <celphi> whenever i create a python webserver if i use 0.0.0.0 it becomes public
[08:14:26] <Dagmar> "WHY GOD WHY DOES IT NOT WORK NOW?!?!"
[08:14:46] <Blondie101010> celphi:  well, does `ip a` contain a real public IP?
[08:14:54] <Dagmar> celphi: That would be because the machine already has a publicly-addressable IP address
[08:14:57] <sheep> 0.0.0.0 means it listens on all available addresses. That doesn't mean that the host has a public ip address
[08:15:09] <labrador> Dagmar, A higher number would override a lower right? Because they are loaded up in alphabetical order?
[08:15:20] <Dagmar> You really shouldn't generally even _need_ to specify 0.0.0.0 since htat's the default behaviour for most things
[08:15:23] <Blondie101010> he's not providing any clarifications, just more confusion

[08:16:05] <Dagmar> Not really overriding, but loaded later.
[08:16:16] <labrador> Oh ok
[08:16:34] <Blondie101010> overriding behaviour is application specificd
[08:16:51] <Dagmar> Reason being you don't always control all the files in a conf.d directory so if you want _your_ settings to be the last one the server soaks up, you aim for 98/99

[17:07:30] <MrElendig> on the other hand libadwaita is also a real boon for many developers since it will make the ui more consistent

[17:15:43] <hexnewbie> Subpixel is fine with me on GTK 3. Qt 5 has it worse, because it does gamma correction which is “correct” (as per FreeType developers), but looks worse to the eyes. But whatever, subpixel has been deprecated by 4K and 8K displays
[17:15:53] <MrElendig> as all tools it can be misused, but used correctly it does save space and makes the ui nicer to navigate

[17:17:24] <hexnewbie> The main problem with client-side decorations is that you cannot maximize windows vertically, horizontally, pin them and shade them without right-clicking on their panel icon

[17:21:41] <hexnewbie> In Windows, programs could add stuff to the title bar as early as Windows 3.x. In X, only KWin has had that without client-side decorations, and only for some Qt apps (particularly KDE ones), and only for some actions. Yet, messing with the title bar, still all native features for the title bar work, unlike CSD on X/Wayland, where they are totally decoupled from the window manager

The alternative (forcing DPI, and forcing the browser to scale the text only) is way worse, because then the layouts don't match, and the text doesn't fit in the pages. It's a
