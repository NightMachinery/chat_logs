[00:02:31] <dale> nij-: The :caller is really just data that is then used to look up certain features in things like alists, or just to vary behavior for little "warts" that are sprinkled throughout Ivy and Counsel.

[11:11:18] <libertyprime> That's what GPT is. Codex was a great name for it :P
[11:11:27] <rgr> if I have a list of strings whats the best elispy way to see if any one of the elements is in a string. eg I have a url, and a list '("youtube" "bbc" "goodreads") if any of those list elements is a component of the url?  
[11:11:38] <wasamasa> turn them into a regex
[11:11:58] <wasamasa> (regexp-opt '("youtube" "bbc" "goodreads"))
[11:12:27] <rgr> ah! yes. And then I can just defcustom the list and convert to regexp at check time. ok. thanks.

[...] One could argue that Copilot is doing the same thing; the only difference is that, since it's a computer, it can read vast amounts of code — even PHP code — without going insane.

[14:21:52] <afidegnum> hi
[14:22:11] <afidegnum> has anyone successfully extended treemacs ? I wanted to create custom relational nodes. but the documentation is limited. 
[14:22:38] <kensanata> dokma: yeah; I'm thinking some variable in that list is marked as risky, but CC mode (?) knows about it, and unsets that, so no warning, but when dired loads the file, it doesn't, so the plist still contains 'risky-local-variable or something like that. Trying to brainstorm...
[14:22:44] <dokma> If I don't have any open C++ files on exit everything is ok. But if I do, they will obviously be reopened by desktop-save-mode and I get the local variables warning.
[14:23:25] <dokma> dired loads the file?

[14:27:34] <dokma> inside files.el
[14:27:50] <kensanata> The only interesting part I see is that desktop-buffer-mode-handlers and desktop-minor-mode-handlers are marked as risky by desktop, so if you're not loading desktop, and one of these two is set in .dir-locals.el, then they are not marked as risky, but if you loaded the desktop code, they are.

[23:42:19] <ciphrCat> i used to have a LinkedIn account. After the acquitition, MS imposed mobile phone number sharing on all new accounts.  Even though I was grandfathered without a mobile phone number, I still closed my LinkedIn account because I will not be the bait by which others are forced to share their mobile phone number with Microsoft, nor will I be a party to excluding those who don't have a mobile phone.

[23:43:05] <dale> bpalmer: I've definitely run into restaurant sites that no longer reflect the restaurant's current state, and I often guess it's because the owner is somewhere between "I don't know how to fix it" and "I forgot I have a web site".
